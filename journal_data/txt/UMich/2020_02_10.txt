Three 
candidates 
for 
Washtenaw County prosecutor 
spoke to a group of about 
60 
community 
members 
regarding 
the 
upcoming 
election for county prosecutor 
at the Arrowwood Community 
Center in Ann Arbor on Sunday 
afternoon.
Arrowwood 
Democratic 
Party hosted the event, which 
was moderated by Ann Arbor 
City 
Councilmembers 
Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1, and Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1. 
The candidates — Arianne 
Slay, Hugo Mack and Eli Savit — 

emphasized a need for change 
to the current local prosecution 
system and proposed unique 
plans to solve criminal justice 
problems facing Washtenaw 
County. 
Slay 
spoke 
first 
about 
her 
platform, 
arguing 
that 
Washtenaw 
County 
is 
at 
a 
crucial 
moment 
and 
underscoring 
the 
need 
to 
reform the criminal justice 
system. 
“The 
criminal 
justice 
system of Washtenaw County 
is at a point of catastrophic 
institutional failure,” Slay said. 
“And that’s a big statement. We 
have policies in place in our 
current administration at the 

prosecutor’s office that have 
reinforced these institutional 
harms. We have a lack of 
flexibility, we have a lack of 
looking at our community in the 
same respect that we have not 
just humans on the prosecution 
side with our victims but we 
have humans on the other side, 
we have lost compassion and 
empathy and I will bring that 
change back.” 
Slay asked attendees to back 
her campaign, emphasizing the 
changes she would implement if 
elected. 
“I’m not just asking for your 
support today, I’m asking for 
your support indefinitely to be 
committed to this cause and 

please, by all stretches of the 
imagination, vote,” Slay said. 
Hugo 
Mack, 
a 
defense 
attorney based in Ypsilanti, 
then discussed what he hopes 
to bring as Washtenaw County’s 
next prosecutor. 
“I am a law enforcement 
officer; I make law enforcement 
first, and reform second,” Mack 
said. “And if that costs me 
the election then so be it, but 
know where I’m coming from. 
I believe that incarceration 
should be the final option, not 
the first choice.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Michael Cox, police chief 
of 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department, has been placed 
on paid administrative leave 
for two weeks, according to an 
email from City Administrator 
Howard 
sent 
on 
Friday 
afternoon.
The email was addressed 
to the mayor, members of City 
Council and Lisa Jackson, the 
Independent Community Police 
Oversight Commission chair.
“I am writing to inform you 
that I have placed Police Chief 
Cox on Administrative Leave 
due to a personnel matter,” 
Lazarus wrote. “Deputy Chief 
Forsberg will serve as the 
Acting Chief.”
Deputy Chief Jason Forsberg 
will assume Cox’s duties while 
Cox is on leave. Forsberg was 
one of three finalists who 
interviewed for the police chief 
position over the summer.

In 
an 
interview 
with 
The Daily, Jackson said the 
commission was not told the 
specifics of the situation.
“I do not know as much as I 
would like to know,” Jackson 
said. “The commission is a 
little concerned that we were 
given the same amount of the 
information as the public was. 
We were not told why.”
However, 
Jackson 
added 
she has been told the leave 
is not due to Cox’s “personal 
misconduct” or an “allegation 
of 
him 
personally 
doing 
something improper.” When 
asked where she acquired this 
knowledge, Jackson said she 
was reassured by “people with 
more information” but declined 
to specify, as she said these 
individuals were likely not 
supposed to have told her.
Jackson 
said 
some 
members of City Council 
have also expressed their 
frustration to her about being 
“in the dark.”

City 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, shared in 
Jackson’s confusion. He said 
he understands the police chief 
will be on leave pending the 
investigation of a matter “we 
don’t know anything about yet.”
“There was no information 
given as to what it pertains 
to, only that there was a need 
to put the senior official on 
an administrative leave so an 
investigation can be conducted 
so we can have the best possible 
look at what happened,” Ramlawi 
said.
The Daily contacted Cox’s 
secretary Keri Hirschman, who 
did not reply prior to publication. 
Cox was sworn in as the city’s 
new police chief in September 
2019 
after 
being 
appointed 
unanimously to the position in 
July 2019 by City Council. Cox’s 
salary starts at $160,000 a year. 
Prior 
to 
coming 
to 
Ann 
Arbor, Cox served in the Boston 
Police Department for 30 years, 
including as a bureau chief for 
the Boston Police Academy from 
2018 until his leave. 
According to Jackson, Lazarus 
dealt 
exclusively 
with 
Cox’s 

leave. Lazarus had recommended 
Cox for the position in June over 
two other candidates vying for 
the role.
She said she found out about 
the 
leave 
Friday 
afternoon 
after being copied on an email 
from Lazarus to City Council 
members. 
Lazarus 
did 
not 
respond to request for comment 
prior to publication.
Ramlawi, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
liaisons to the ICPOC alongside 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, said he received a phone 
call from Lazarus informing him 
of Cox’s leave before the email 
was sent. ICPOC was established 
by City Council in 2018 following 
years 
of 
advocacy 
by 
local 
activists. 
Lumm 
did 
not 
reply 
to 
request for comment by time of 
publication. 
Ramlawi said he is unsure why 
Cox’s leave will last two weeks. 
“I’m not sure what made the 
city 
administrator 
believe 
it 
would just take two weeks, or 
whether they might come back 
and ask for more time after that,” 
Ramlawi said. “I would only be 
guessing.”
Jackson said the fact that 
the leave has a specified time 
frame “strikes a lot of people as 
strange.”
“If there is an investigation we 

want to know into what,” Jackson 
said. “If there is an investigation 
we’d like to know on what 
evidence that investigation is 
being 
conducted. 
Those 
are 
things we don’t have answers 
to now, and those are things we 
would like and we would like that 
information to be made public.”
Despite the ICPOC receiving 
minimal 
information 
about 
Cox’s leave, while he was being 
considered 
for 
the 
position 
in 
March, 
Cox 
emphasized 
transparency, expressing that 
he believes a police oversight 
commission had an important 
role to play in the community, 
bridging the gap between law 
enforcement and the public.
“I think in policing we don’t 
always educate the public or 
educate folks on what we do or 
how we do it, and the oversight 
commission is just an opportunity 
for that education process to 
exist in a more transparent way,” 
Cox said. 
Forsberg has also commended 
the commission as an important 
transparency and accountability tool.
“I 
think 
the 
policing 
commission 
is 
a 
great 
opportunity to begin bridging 
that gap,” Forsberg said. “We 
really only do begin building 
trust by having transparency — 
having accountability within the 

ranks. But we do a lot of great 
work right now that, I feel like, 
people just don’t know about.”
In 1995, Cox was beaten 
by other police officers while 
undercover. According to Cox in 
a previous interview with The 
Daily, his experience with police 
brutality and others in which 
he said he has been mistaken 
as the suspect rather than the 
officer have informed his belief 
in fostering trust between law 
enforcement and the community. 
“Interacting with the public 
in ways that don’t have to do 
with normal police work is 
important and builds trust,” 
Cox said. “It helps us figure out 
what the community wants. It 
helps the officers get to know the 
community, and the community 
gets to know the officers.” 
Though 
Ramlawi 
said 
he 
would like more information, he 
said he understands not everyone 
can know the details because 
there can’t be “five different 
bosses.” He urged patience as the 
investigation plays out.
“We need to have trust in 
a system that has checks and 
balances hopefully,” Ramlawi 
said. “You want due process. 
All too often, we just jump to 
conclusions… It’s important to 
take our time and just allow the 
process to work.”

Kurtz then introduced Dingell 
to the crowd. Though Dingell 
has not endorsed Bloomberg, she 
spoke about their friendship and 
the Democratic Party’s goal of 

defeating President Donald Trump 
in the 2020 election.
“I know every one of the 
presidential candidates,” Dingell 
said. “I’ve known Mike for a long 
time, so I’m staying neutral and I’m 
going to support who the people of 
the 12th District support because 
we got to come together. We cannot 
not come together because if we 

don’t, we have four more years and 
what it’ll do to our democracy, I 
don’t know.”
Following Dingell, Jones spoke 
to the crowd. He voiced his support 
of Bloomberg and of the campaign’s 
priorities. 
“I’ll tell you this, what I’ve 
learned over my 10 years of playing 
in the NFL is learning how to pick 

a great team, so welcome to Team 
Bloomberg,” Jones said. “This is 
why I believe in Mike, number one, 
he’s a great leader. He’s a motivator, 
and he’s a unifier. He never lets 
anything get in the way of success, 
things are practical. He’s got a 
practical way about him in order to 
achieve his ultimate goal and that’s 
to bring everybody together.”
The event closed with remarks 
from Erica Bolton, Bloomberg’s 
regional 
organizing 
director. 
Bolton expressed the importance 
of getting out and volunteering for 
a political campaign ahead of the 
2020 election. 
“I ask that you would continue 
to support, continue to be involved, 
continue to lend your voice to 
making sure that change happens 
because it takes each and every 
one of us,” Bolton said. “Even your 
neighbors and your friends that say 
they’re not political — because they 
are this year.”

During the television airing 
of the 2020 Grammy Awards 
Ceremony, 
Google 
released 
its new Black History Month 
advertisement. The 1-minute 
commercial titled, “The Most 
Searched: 
A 
Celebration 
of 
Black 
History 
Makers” 
demonstrates the amazing feats 
Black people have accomplished 
throughout history based on 
how many people have looked 
them up on the search engine. 
The Civil Rights Movement 
holds the spot of the “most 
searched 
movement,” 
Maya 
Angelou is the “most searched 
female poet,” and so on.
I 
personally 
enjoyed 
the 
video. It reinforces the fact 
that Black people have been 

vital to American culture and 
history 
since 
the 
creation 
of our country. It is a small 
but powerful way of getting 
the 
recognition 
we, 
as 
a 
community, deserve. However, 
it had me and other Black folks 
wondering about the integrity 
of companies who use Black 
History Month as a marketing 
tool.
This isn’t a new suspicion. 
People are often wary of the 
motivations of companies who 
use Black History Month and 
Pride Month to appeal to those 
communities and sell them 
products. This is because once 
the month is over, the support 
is wiped away along with the 
exclusive 
merchandise 
that 
comes along with it.
While it is nice that big 
companies like Google celebrate 
Black culture, they are not 

successful in supporting their 
Black employees. In 2018, Black 
people made up a disappointing 
4.8% of Google’s workforce, 
while the population of Black 
people in the United States 
is 13%. In addition, multiple 
former Google employees have 
released 
memos 
expressing 
the 
hardships 
they 
faced 
while 
working 
there. 
One 
former employee has even said 
they, “never stopped feeling 
the burden of being Black at 
Google.”
This 
situation 
opens 
up 
a major conversation about 
companies, 
institutions 
and 
people 
adoring 
Black 
culture while neglecting and 
marginalizing 
Black 
people. 
Black 
History 
Month 
is 
important, no one is denying 
that. Year after year, people 
take the time during Black 
History Month to look further 
than the prominent figures 
like Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., uplifting Black people from 
our past that have done great 
things to make a better future. 
It’s a time of reflection and 
celebration.
Further, there are calls for 
Google to include “the good 

and the bad” experiences of 
being Black in America. While 
many Black people excel in 
their 
respected 
fields, 
this 
does not mean that the racism, 
discrimination 
and 
violence 
our group faces has magically 
disappeared. 
While 
we 
celebrate the greats, we need 
to acknowledge that there are 
systemic disadvantages Black 
people face that stop them from 
being able to become the next 
great judge or heart surgeon.
But Black people deserve 
more. We deserve to be hired 
at companies that are making 
strides to be anti-racist and 
have equitable hiring practices 

that eliminate racial biases 
in the employment process. 
We deserve to be present and 
represented in history books 
but also lecture in classrooms, 
in front of and behind the 
camera, serve on city councils, 
and act as CEO at our dream 
jobs. We are more than the 

entertainment, 
scientific 
advancements 
and 
political 
quotes we give to the world.
So this Black History Month, 
if you plan on creating an 
advertisement, 
program 
or 
event celebrating Black culture, 
make sure you move beyond 
that and uplift Black people too.

Coronavirus Epidemic: a Conundrum on 
Chinese Imperialism and Xenophobia

News Flash! 
You can criticize the Chinese 
Communist government and 
the 
Chinese 
imperialism 
sympathizers 
for 
the 
coronavirus 
epidemic 
while 
standing against racism and 
xenophobia, as you should.
For the past month, Asians 
in the diaspora have been 
speaking up against racism 
and 
xenophobia 
they 
have 
encountered because of the 
coronavirus 
epidemic. 
The 
narrative that Asian folx are 
dirty and diseased based on the 
fact that coronavirus started 
in China skews the perception 
of Asians in the public eye. 
For example, the UC-Berkeley 
health center received backlash 
by saying that “recognizing 
any of [the xenophobic actions] 
can be normal reactions.” 
Yesterday, 
a 
man 
in 
Chinatown in Sydney suffered 
from 
a 
heart 
attack 
and 
people were scared to give 
CPR because of the fear of the 
epidemic. 
Many 
insensitive 
memes about the epidemic 
and negative connotation of 
Asians have also surfaced on 
the internet and around our 
communities in the U.S. lately. 
In reality, if you are currently 
living in the U.S. and have 
not been to China for the past 
month, you are more likely to 
catch the flu and die from it 
than the coronavirus. 
On the other hand, leftists 
on social media, specifically 
the tankies, have criticized 
the racialization and are also 
so quick to draw conclusions 
that it is western propaganda 
to report the epidemic in a 
way that vilifies the People’s 
Republic 
of 
China 
(PRC) 
government. 
Whenever 
any 
political issue involving the 
United 
States 
and 
China 
relations 
comes 
up, 
it 
is 
exhausting to see that a lot 
of diasporic Asian folx in 
“leftist spaces” have such a 
U.S.-centric understanding of 
the imperial power in the 21st 
century. I always have to let you 
gaslight my lived experiences 
as a Hongkonger before I 

can chip in my two cents to 
debunk your fake-wokeness on 
China. The PRC government 
doesn’t actually care about 
the well-being of its everyday 
citizens, it only cares about 
economic stability so that the 
ones who hold political and 
economic power in China can 
harvest their fruits of social 
capitalism in the name of being 
“communist.”
Let me be clear here, we 
should stand against all forms 
of 
racism 
and 
xenophobia 
and we will continue to do so 
while living under oppressive 
structures upheld by white 
supremacy. Criticism of the 
crisis control on the PRC 
government’s end does not make 
it acceptable at all for anyone 
to make microaggressive jokes 
about the epidemic or make 
hateful comments about any 
Asian people. This is not only 
extremely 
disrespectful 
to 
patients, everyday citizens and 
clinical staff who are suffering 
from the epidemic in Asia, but 
it also feeds into the racist 
narrative that people of color 
are dirty and diseased. 
In short, people who care 
about social issues should start 
having more intuitive thoughts 
and discussions about the root 
causes of these problems and 
how countries use borders as 
a colonial construct to impose 
their nationalist agendas in 
the 21st century. I am writing 
from the perspective that I 
have witnessed fear from the 
epidemic 
and 
government 
mishandling in the last few 
days of my winter break in 
Hong Kong and have close 
friends 
and 
family 
back 
home who are terrified. It is 
important to recognize that 
I am NOT analyzing from a 
diasporic lens. Today, China 
is not a developing country, it 
is an imperial power, actively 
commiting 
genocide 
and 
colonizing Lands in Tibet, 
“Xinjiang,” 
Sri 
Lanka 
and 
countries 
in 
Africa. 
Since 
the Great Leap Forward and 
economic reform in 1978, the 
class 
barriers 
and 
wealth 
disparity we all witness in the 
capitalist countries like the U.S. 
can also be seen in mainland 
China under social capitalism. 

It is dangerous to think in a 
binary sense that standing 
against U.S. imperialism is to 
deny Han Chinese imperialism, 
when in fact they are mutually 
exclusive. It is reasonable to 
critique the lack of health 
measures and policies in any 
fascist, imperial country.
Here 
are 
some 
puzzle 
pieces I have gathered of this 
epidemic:
During 
2003, 
the 
PRC 
government covered up the 
SARS epidemic, until it spread 
across Hong Kong, leading to 
286 deaths confirmed in Hong 
Kong alone. The SARS virus 
is fundamentally the same as 
the coronavirus in terms of its 
root causes and biostructure. 
It is reasonable for the PRC 
government to take the SARS 
epidemic as a lesson to take 
more 
preventative 
actions. 
However, PRC covered up data 
and figures of coronavirus 
for at least two weeks before 
it 
realized 
the 
escalation 
and 
eventually 
declared 
emergency.
While 
food 
culture 
and 
habits should not be mocked or 
racialized, research has proven 
that both the 2003 SARS 
epidemic 
and 
coronavirus 
potentially 
stemmed 
from 
the wildlife markets. Medical 
researchers 
around 
the 
world have warned China to 
stay alert when consuming 
wildlife during the aftermath 

of the SARS epidemic and 
to establish heavier health 
measures and legal actions 
on 
endangered 
animals. 
Despite 
having 
Wildlife 
Protection Law in place since 
1988 and last amended in 
2003, many loopholes exist, 
leading to failure in actual 
implementations. 
A few days before China 
declared 
an 
emergency 
in 
Wuhan, 
8 
people 
on 
the 
Weibo 
blog 
posted 
about 
the urgency and escalation 
of 
the 
coronavirus. 
Not 
only did the local district 
government not act upon it, 
but they also arrested them for 
“misinformation,” potentially 
destabilizing the state, when 
they were telling the truth. 
These 8 people are still jailed 
at this moment. Additionally, a 
self-proclaimed Wuhan citizen 
has publicly expressed fear 
over the lockdown and anger 
towards the PRC government 
recently in a video.
Contrary 
to 
many 
news 
sources stating that the first 
case 
of 
coronavirus 
was 
confirmed on December 31st 
in 
Wuhan, 
recent 
medical 
research from the medical 
school at the University of 
New England has shown that 
the earliest signs of human 
transmitted coronavirus can be 
traced back to mid-December. 
Due to increased tension 
between Taiwan and PRC, 

China has prevented Taiwan’s 
involvement in the World’s 
Health Organization including 
the international emergency 
implementation 
against 
the 
coronavirus epidemic. Since 
the 
geographic 
distance 
between China and Taiwan is 
so close, this deeply impacts 
Taiwan, as they do not receive 
information 
from 
WHO 
in 
a timely matter or have any 
say within WHO. China also 
has close ties with WHO. 
Diplomatic sources in Geneva 
criticized the late declaration 
for an emergency, suspecting 
that the close ties between 
China and the UN lead to biases 
and questionable credibility of 
WHO.
Since hospitals in China are 
mostly occupied, high-speed 
rail border entry increased 
by 40% in Hong Kong last 
Monday. 
Many 
rushed 
to 
Hong Kong last week to seek 
treatment when most hospitals 
in Hong Kong were already 
overcrowded by an average of 
113% in the first place, having 
huge health and fire hazards. 
Clinical staff in HK were so 
frustrated that 3600 clinical 
staff 
are 
unionizing 
and 
planning to go on strike. Chief 
executive of Hong Kong, Carrie 
Lam, described the medical 
staff strikers as “using extreme 
means to beleaguer Hospital 
Authority.” 
HKU medical school has 

successfully 
developed 
a 
coronavirus 
preliminary 
vaccine, but the Hong Kong 
government 
decided 
to 
withdraw $250M of research 
funding 
for 
HKU 
medical 
teaching facilities due to the 
Hong Kong protests. Public 
hospital staff has not received 
any 
overtime 
compensation 
working overtime in high-
stress 
environments 
either. 
To give you a comparison, 
Hong Kong police, infamous 
for its brutality for the past 7 
months in Hong Kong protests, 
has just received $950M of 
funding from the Hong Kong 
government 
for 
overtime 
compensation last month.
To reiterate, speaking on the 
PRC government’s failure on 
health measures doesn’t mean 
it’s okay for anyone to make 
fun of this epidemic, but rather 
get everyone to think more 
critically of the root cause and 
what is actually happening 
here. 
You 
can 
be 
critical 
of 
a 
government 
without 
being racist or xenophobic. 
It is unproductive to twist 
criticisms as U.S. propaganda. 
In fact, while we are criticizing 
the 
health 
measures 
from 
this epidemic, let’s also have 
discussions on the U.S.’s poor 
public health implementation 
as 
well, 
especially 
when 
34,200 
Americans 
died 
during flu season last winter. 
Comparatively, 
measles 
is 
one of the most common viral 
infections in the U.S. since the 
1900s largely affects patients 
who are not vaccinated. Let’s 
start 
having 
conversations 
about what kind of global 
changes in public health we 
should be implementing as 
we carry hope for our future 
generations. If health crises 
aren’t thrown onto a political 
playground 
by 
imperial 
regimes, we can be way more 
productive 
with 
healthcare 
systems and more cognizant 
with epidemics. And to white 
people 
in 
the 
west, 
next 
time you joke about having 
coronavirus when you cough 
without covering your mouth, 
consider asking yourself if you 
have gotten your flu shot yet 
this year.

Trump’s two worst enemies you’ve never heard of
O

n Sept. 24, 2019, Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi held a press 
conference 
launching 
the official impeachment inquiry 
against President Donald Trump. 
That day, she introduced America 
to the six-headed monster of 
committee chairmen who were 
investigating Trump. If you pay 
attention to politics, you probably 
know U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, 
D-Calif., Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., 
Maxine Waters, D-Calif. and the late 
Elijah Cummings, D-Md. Each has 
become famous via their frequent 
appearances on cable news or viral 
clips berating cabinet secretaries 
— or, in the case of Nadler, buckets 
of fried chicken. However, unless 
you’re from the East Coast or pay 
too much attention to politics, you 
probably did not recognize the 
chairmen of the Congressional 
Ways and Means Committee and 
Foreign Affairs Committee. The 
two men, Reps. Richard Neal, 
D-Mass., and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., 
have planted several landmines just 
waiting to explode on Trump. 
Neal, a grown man who goes by 
“Richie,” has spent his entire career 
devoted to budgetary and economic 
issues. His record is an economic 
policy treasure trove, focused on 
simplifying the tax code, repealing 
the Alternative Minimum Tax and 
supporting lower trade barriers. 
He operated in Washington under 
the radar for years until he came 
to prominence in 2007 when he 
clashed with another prominent 
policymaker, 
Rep. 
Paul 
Ryan, 
R-Wis., 
over 
the 
Alternative 
Minimum Tax. 
While Neal’s bill eventually lost 
out, his new notoriety in policy 
circles allowed him to chair the 
Ways and Means subcommittee 
on Select Revenue Measures the 
following year. He then became 
the ranking member of Ways and 
Means in 2017, once again sparring 
with Ryan through the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act of 2017 — another 
fight he ultimately lost. However, 
he got the ultimate win over Ryan 
by becoming the chairman of Ways 
and Means when Ryan left office.
Though he has been quiet, 
preferring to operate out of the 
public eye, Neal has had a busy year. 
First, he and the committee built a 
comprehensive legal argument for 

subpoenaing Trump’s tax returns 
and he is now the lead plaintiff in a 
court fight over that subpoena. Soon 
after he became one of the leading 
Democrats 
on 
the 
President’s 
NAFTA 2.0 trade agreement, also 
known as the United States-Mexico-
Canada 
Agreement 
(USMCA). 
In his spare time, Neal has been 
chairing the Joint Congressional 
Committee on Taxation and trying 
to pass Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 
prescription drug bill.
Such a large profile prompts one 
question: How is he doing? The 
answer: Not bad, but there are still 
some big issues on the table. The 
USMCA passed both chambers, 
the Joint Committee released a 
large-scale report earlier this week 
and the tax returns case is working 
its way through the federal court 
system. However, the USMCA 
contained lower labor standards 
than Neal initially set out for, the 
prescription drug bill has stalled 
and he still hasn’t received those tax 
returns. Putting his mixed record 
aside, though, Neal could be easily 
described as Democrats’ largest 
domestic policy asset, and with 
China’s “Phase 1” trade deal coming 
to the House floor, this might not be 
the last time you hear about him. 
In contrast to the rank-and-file 
Neal, Engel, whose mustache might 
be more prominent than the man it’s 
attached to, has been one of the few 
members of Congress whose career 
has been defined by bipartisan 
compromises. First elected in 1988 
based on his progressive idealism, 
Engel was an early proponent 
of single-payer healthcare, paid 
family leave and an assault weapons 
ban. 
However, 
Engel’s 
career 
path was altered forever when 
he fell in love with foreign policy 
in 1996. He came to prominence 
in Washington as the leader of 
a 
bipartisan 
group 
criticizing 
the 
Clinton 
administration’s 
noninterventionism in the Kosovo 
genocide. In fact, he became so 
intertwined with justice for the 
small nation that a street in its 
capital is named after him. This 
trend 
of 
criticizing 
presidents 
from both sides of the aisle 
contributed to his credibility in 
Washington’s foreign policy circles 
as a principled member. This was 
especially reflected in 2015 when 

Engel vocally opposed the Obama 
administration’s Iran nuclear deal. 
As the ranking member of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Engel has led bipartisan trips 
abroad that tour everything from 
war zones to the Munich Security 
Conference, which grants him 
significant goodwill on both sides of 
the aisle. Recognizing his bipartisan 
history, House Republicans were 
not upset with Engel’s appointment 
to the Foreign Affairs chairmanship 
after the 2018 midterms. 
The Trump administration’s 
plethora of foreign policy blunders 
have kept Engel busy over the 
past year, but none more than the 
Ukraine scandal. This scandal and 
subsequent 
impeachment 
saga 
threatened to put Engel on center 
stage, with his committee being 
one of the three allowed to attend 
closed-door depositions. When the 
televised impeachment hearings 
were looming, Engel was faced 
with a decision: go on the cable 
news circuit or forego the spotlight. 
He quickly chose the latter and 
allowed Schiff and Nadler to be 
mocked nightly by journalistic 
paragons like Greg Gutfeld, Tucker 
Carlson and Sean Hannity. In the 
following weeks, the news cycle 
churned on and Engel returned 
to his largely thankless day job of 
having his subpoenas ignored by 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 
However, with about 10 months 
until election day and countless 
foreign policy decisions, from 
Russia to Iran to whatever Jared 
Kushner is doing, this is likely not 
the last you will hear of Engel, 
either.
Simply put, both Neal and 
Engel have consciously avoided 
the gaze of the general public, 
preferring to silently lay traps for 
Trump using their high offices 
and 
large 
portfolios. 
When 
the 
administration 
inevitably 
encounters one of these traps — my 
bet is Neal’s tax return subpoena or 
Engel’s Ukraine revelations — they 
will find a foe with tremendous 
respect and without a demeaning 
nickname bestowed by Fox News 
or Trump’s Twitter feed. That is 
the point.

Waiting outside the golden door
P

oet Emma Lazarus’s words 
displayed on the Statue 
of Liberty will likely be 
remembered for decades to come. 
The text of her poem “The New 
Colossus,” which experts have 
praised for both its poise and 
defiance, ends with an iconic, 
powerful call to action: “ ‘Give 
me your tired, your poor, / Your 
huddled masses yearning to breathe 
free, / The wretched refuse of your 
teeming shore. / Send these, the 
homeless, tempest-tost to me, / I lift 
my lamp beside the golden door!’ ” 
While 
speaking 
to 
NPR’s 
Morning Edition to announce a 
new immigration regulation, Ken 
Cuccinelli, acting Director of U.S. 
Citizenship 
and 
Immigration 
Services (USCIS), suggested in a 
smirking aside to “Give me your tired 
and your poor who can stand on 
their own two feet and who will not 
become a public charge.” 
“No one has a right to become 
an American who isn’t born here 
as an American,” said Cuccinelli, 
director of the agency primarily 
responsible for immigration and 
citizenship 
applications 
in 
the 
United States. Many in immigration 
policy circles have been attentive 
to the recent Supreme Court ruling 
about Cuccinelli’s proposed public 
charge rule that has restricted legal 
immigration in the U.S. Put simply, 
the “public charge” rule renders an 
individual ineligible for permanent 
legal residence status (also known as 
a “green card” or LPR) if they receive 
in-kind (i.e., non-cash) government 
assistance such as Medicaid, housing 
vouchers or food stamps. For some, 
perhaps the logic seems intuitive 
enough: Given that government 
assistance is funded by taxpayers, 
the cost of thousands of immigrants 
qualifying and receiving welfare 
every year would be enormous for 
U.S. citizens. (Please do note that 
non-citizens also do pay taxes, and 
that is often a condition to receive 
LPR). 

The reality is that there are 
already fairly restrictive guidelines 
in place that determine who can 
and cannot obtain legal permanent 
residence in the U.S. To have a 
decent chance at legal permanent 
residency, immigrants need to 
produce an affidavit of support that 
indicates they or a close relative who 
is already a citizen earns a steady, 
substantial income. And that’s just 
one example — there are many 
biometric screening procedures in 
place to confirm that immigrants 
or their families are considered 
adequate 
for 
legal 
permanent 
residence. 

Now, under the new public 
charge regulation, an immigrant 
who has received assistance within 
36 months (three years) of applying 
for legal permanent residence or 
seems “likely” to receive assistance 
at some point in the future will be 
ineligible. For example, a single 
mother who receives government 
benefits while she searches for 
employment in the U.S., secures 
a job and then applies for legal 
permanent residence would be 
ineligible even if she or her children 
never 
received 
government 
assistance ever again. 
Many supporters of the new 
regulation insist that the regulation 
is only an extension of prior policy. 
Prior to the new USCIS regulation, 
immigration 
officials 
did 
not 
typically enforce the public charge 
rule as it was difficult to assess what 

it meant for somebody to be “likely” 
to receive assistance and the rule 
seemed fairly counter-intuitive. After 
all, many immigrants come to the 
U.S. in search of better employment, 
housing or education opportunities 
than in their home countries. Some 
immigrants who flee the social or 
political conditions in their home 
countries may be unable to take 
forms of material wealth with them 
into the U.S., and it’s unreasonable to 
assume that everyone should have 
the means to make it in America 
immediately upon arriving. 
It is also worth noting that 
over-arching regulations and bans 
are unprecedented in American 
immigration law. Both President 
Jimmy Carter’s Iran order and 
President Ronald Reagan’s Cuba 
proclamation, 
which 
invoked 
the need for a national security-
based limit on immigration visas, 
adopted a case-by-case approach. 
In the dissenting opinion in 
Trump v. Hawaii, Justice Stephen 
Breyer pondered, “... if those two 
Presidents thought a case-by-case 
exemption 
system 
appropriate, 
what is different about present 
circumstances that would justify 
that system’s absence?” 
It is important to call out the 
new regulation for exactly what 
it is. The new public charge rule 
sends the message that immigrants 
are only welcome if they can 
come to the U.S. with substantial 
means and resources, which is 
both disconnected from reality 
and socially irresponsible. Public 
health experts are also worried 
that the new rule won’t limit 
immigration flows into the U.S. 
but rather convince immigrants to 
stop seeking healthcare through 
Medicaid or other public health 
benefits.

Palestine’s missed opportunity

L

ast 
week, 
President 
Donald Trump released 
his much-anticipated and 
self-titled “Deal of the Century,” 
the administration’s framework to 
resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
With the deal finally published in 
detail, a wide spectrum of responses 
arose into the discourse. Overall, 
there appeared to be approval from 
Israel’s government, led (for now) by 
Trump confidant and veteran Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu, 
along with mixed reviews from the 
American public and the American 
Jewish community. There were also 
expected responses of disapproval 
and 
rejection 
by 
Palestinians, 
among whom Mahmoud Abbas 
— president of the Palestinian 
National Authority — stood out with 
his declaration of “a thousand no’s.” 
The use of the term “Arab-Israeli 
conflict” to refer to the tension that 
has lasted — in one way or another 
— for over a century, is purposeful. 
Arab states and their leaders 
have always played a significant 
role in shaping the course of the 
conflict throughout the decades. 
Such examples include former 
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel 
Nasser’s casus belli that set both 
the consequential 1967 Six-Day 
War into motion and the 2002 
Saudi-led Arab Peace Initiative that 
conditioned the establishment of 
formal ties between Israel and Arab 
states on the premise that Israel 
withdraw to the 1949 armistice 
lines, or as they have often been 
called, the “1967 Lines.” It is clear 
that the position taken by Arab 
leaders has proved influential in 
determining much of the discourse 
surrounding the conflict, if not the 
facts on the ground themselves.
With such context in mind, 
the response of many important 
Arab figures to the release of the 
Trump plan is quite notable. On 
Jan. 28, when the details of the plan 
were put out in full, dignitaries from 
many Arab countries either came 
to Washington to show support 
for the deal or released statements 
encouraging the diplomatic efforts 
and urging acceptance of the plan 
as a basis for ongoing talks. Such 
countries include Bahrain, Oman, 

the United Arab Emirates, Saudi 
Arabia and Morocco. Their support 
for the plan as a start to future 
negotiations, and even support for 
the plan itself, is telling because it 
reveals the beginnings of a shift 
in the attitude of the Arab world 
towards the plight of Palestinian 
nationalism.
With each solution that has been 
proposed for resolving the Arab-
Israeli conflict, those who now 
identify themselves as Palestinians 
have received a less generous offer. 
Indeed, even plans for peace during 
the British Mandate period were 
almost 
completely 
sympathetic 
to Arab desires. The 1947 United 
Nations partition plan, the design 
of which gave Arabs much of the 
agriculturally viable and historically 
meaningful land and gave Jews the 
desert for most of their territory, 
was quickly accepted by then-Israeli 
Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion 
(whose partner, would-be Israeli 
President Chaim Weizmann, would 
have accepted much less) and the 
Jewish Yishuv, and so the formal 
framework for Israel’s establishment 
was advanced. 
Even after the existence of 
Israel was solidified through law 
and survival from multiple wars of 
attempted annihilation, rejections 
continued, 
leaving 
Palestinians 
without a state as a result of their 
inflexible demands. Negotiations 
from the 1990s until 2000 led by 
former President Bill Clinton were 
known to have stalled due to Yasser 
Arafat’s unwillingness to budge, 
and Clinton himself has blamed 
the Palestinian leader for dooming 
peace prospects at the Camp David 
summit. Even with all parties under 
new leadership in 2008, with a 
surprisingly generous proposal that 
included Israel ceding its claim to a 
united capital in Jerusalem in favor 
of establishing it as international 
territory, met Palestinian rejection. 
The pattern can be seen here, 
clear as day. To paraphrase Israeli 
diplomat and U.N. Ambassador 
Abba Eban, the Palestinians “never 
miss an opportunity to miss an 
opportunity.” 
It is important to know and 
recognize 
this 
history 
when 

evaluating the offer the Palestinians 
currently find in front of them. Yes, 
it is significantly less sympathetic 
to their demands and desires 
compared to previous proposals, 
and addresses Israeli concerns 
prominently. However, if Abbas 
and the rest of the Palestinian 
leadership find the “Deal of the 
Century” 
to 
be 
unacceptable, 
they have only their predecessors 
and themselves to blame. They 
repeatedly refused compromise 
and even a small waiting period to 
receive everything they desired, 
and now question how they find 
themselves in such a predicament. 
The reactions by many Arab 
states to the release of a peace 
plan generally understood to be 
favorable to Israel reveal that 
their leaders, to some degree, also 
acknowledge the true history of 
Arab-Israeli negotiations. They 
are at least subtly calling on the 
Palestinians 
to 
finally 
accept 
something after over a century of 
dispute that they have perpetuated 
through stubbornness, delusion 
and often ill will.
Many 
Israelis, 
Palestinians 
and their supporters all have 
varying gripes with the terms of 
the Trump plan or the future it 
may lay out. Yet if the Palestinian 
leadership has learned anything 
from past or current patterns of 
the conflict, and truly wants to 
accomplish 
something 
rather 
than simply seeking victimhood, 
representatives should at least 
come to the negotiating table and 
civilly voice their concerns. 
After Abbas’s boycott of the 
Trump administration following 
its recognition of the basic fact that 
Jerusalem is Israel’s capital and 
the subsequent relocation of the 
U.S. Embassy, they have no right to 
complain about not influencing the 
original formation of the plan. If 
they seek to have any control over 
their future, Abbas must swallow 
his pride and come prepared to talk. 
If not, Palestinians will continue to 
have only their own leaders to blame 
for their current plight.

I didn’t know who Mac 
Miller was until he died. 
I knew he dated Ariana 
Grande. I knew he wrote a song 
about that one guy who hosted 
NBC’s 
“The 
Apprentice.” 
I 
knew I didn’t like Blue Slide 
Park when it came out. These 
were my thoughts as I read 
“RIP MAC MILLER” from a 
slab of ply-wood leaning on 
a frat house on my way back 
from a football game on Sept. 
8, 2018. I didn’t have many 
more thoughts until later that 
night when I first listened to 
Swimming. I sat in my dorm 
room with the lights off and 
played it once all the way 
though, sorting its highlights 
like “Ladders” and “What’s 
the Use” into various playlists. 
I hadn’t listened to an album 
that captured depression quite 
like it, and I wished I could’ve 
heard it at least once before 
Mac’s passing. 
The wounded album trailed 
Mac’s 
shattered 
interiority 
following a career grounded 
in a seemingly high-spirited, 
humorous 
demeanor. 
His 
struggle with drug addiction 
and depression weren’t new 
topics as much as they were 
pillars to a notoriously fun 
discography. Take “Rain” from 
Faces: “That’s a flex though, 
cover up the issues that I kept 
close / Sober I can’t deal, I’m in 
the corner with my head low / 
Runnin’ from my shadow, never 

ending chase / Ease the pain 
and the battle that’s within 
me / Sniff the same shit that 
got Whitney, the high heel 
depression / My temple feel 
the metal comin’ out the Smith 
& Wesson, bang / Say a prayer, 
leave my brains on the tile 
floor.” Swimming amalgamated 
these themes and the emotions 

that easily hovered under the 
radar and slipped past the 
media’s gaze. Whereas The 
Divine Feminine is an ode to love 
and togetherness, Swimming 
is 
lonesome. 
Swimming 
is 
stopping to catch your breath 
after a long jog. Mac struggled 
to stay afloat amid a livelihood 
accustomed to the support of 
others. Whereas sonic soulmate 
Ariana 
Grande 
seemingly 
moved on romantically with 
ease, Mac was emotionally and 
mentally stagnant. 
Circles is an album designed 

in the same mindset of its 
sister Swimming. Envisioned 
alongside 
another 
concept 
album that never came to 
fruition (Oblivion), Circles was 
left nearly complete when Mac 
died. The early versions of the 
album were worked through 
Mac and producer Jon Brion, 
who took the initiative of 
finishing the album following 
Mac’s 
passing. 
“This 
is 
a 
complicated process that has 
no right answer. No clear 
path,” Mac’s family wrote in 
an Instagram post. “We simply 
know that it was important to 
Malcolm for the world to hear 
it.”
Circles was developed to loop 
back to Swimming. This idea 
harkens back to Swimming’s 
closer “So it Goes,” an eerie 
reference to death in Kurt 
Vonnegut’s 
“Slaughterhouse-
Five.” “My god, it go on and 
on,” he raps. “Just like a circle, 
I go back to where I’m from.” 
Both albums are centered on 
depression 
and 
its 
ensuing 
anxieties, but Circles is a lot 
more optimistic, more willing 
to wait out the storm. On 
Swimming track “Come Back 
to Earth,” Mac raps “I just 
need a way out of my head / 
I’ll do anything for a way out 
of my head.” Circles responds 
to 
this 
predicament 
across 
multiple songs. He is “spring 
cleaning” in plucked single 
“Good News” and recognizes 
that “(it) is getting pretty 
cluttered” and hard to “clean 
up” the mess he’s made in his 
head on “Complicated.” Mac 
tries to clean up a lot on Circles, 

whether it be his head or his 
public image. 
Circles depicts Mac as lonely, 
but still alongside others. He 
isn’t afraid to question his 
capacity for love on “Woods.” 
Produced 
by 
longtime 
collaborator 
E. 
Dan, 
Mac 
questions his own emotions 
following a rift in a relationship. 
“Do I, do I, do I love?,” he sings 
in the chorus. Mac does rap on 
songs like “Hand Me Downs” 
but the aura is loose and 
contemplative. With Baro as 
the album’s only feature in the 
chorus, Mac envisions a future 
alongside a family: “You remind 
me / Shit, I need to stay in line 
/ You damn well are a great 
design,” Baro croons. “You, 
despite being an only child / 
Say you need more of a family 
‘round / Let’s turn these genes 
into hand me downs.” 
Thematically and sonically, 
Circles 
is 
his 
most 
naked 
release. 
The 
album 
never 
breaks 
out 
into 
traditional 
rap with the exception of 
“Hands,” a song about negative 
self-destructive behaviors in 

the sound and style of Faces. 
Despite Jon Brion finishing 
much of the production for 
Circles, the aesthetic is very 
Mac. 
The 
lo-fi 
beats 
and 
soulful, jazzy glimmers gather 
the same energy as Mac’s 
Space Migration Tour with 
The Internet in 2013. Circles is 
iridescent. With a hypnotic grip 
on elements from Mac’s ever-
evolving music style, it grooves 
as easily as a traditional Mac 
album. 
Whether it be Mac laying 
in his grave in his final music 
video “Self Care,” the eerily 
fated prediction to “join the 
27 club” on “God Speed” or his 
posting “So it Goes” as his last 
Instagram story, the writing 
on 
the 
wall 
and 
fatalistic 
undertones grip you. This is 
not the case with Circles. Mac’s 
exhaustion coats every lyric 
but with a subtle, gentle hope. 
Whereas Swimming considers 
living in the long term, Circles 
takes itself one day at a time. I 
think a lot back to the moment 
in “Complicated,” where Mac 
sings, “‘Fore I start to think 

about the future / First, can 
I please get through a day?” a 
reprise to the first verse: “Some 
people say they want to live 
forever / That’s way too long, 
I’ll just get through today.” 
Circles was a surreal release 
for me; I never expected myself 
to 
know 
the 
anticipation 
of waiting for a Mac Miller 
album. 
The 
circumstances 
were completely different, but 
Circles looped me back to my 
discovery of Swimming. I knew 
a lot more about Mac this time 
around, and I knew that this 
album would resonate with me, 
something I hadn’t expected 
from 
Swimming. 
Circles, 
as 
anguished and tired as it is, is a 
comfortably ephemeral closing 
to Mac Miller and the legacy he 
left behind. This album takes 
us back to the heartbreak of 
Swimming; we’ll never know 
how Mac would’ve progressed 
beyond this point. The one 
thing I do know is that there 
couldn’t have been a better 
musical send off to Mac than an 
album that epilogues his spirit 
and style the way this one does.

“Briarpatch” 
opens 
on 
a 
99-degree 
morning 
in 
San 
Bonifacio, Texas. A landlady, who 
is also a police detective, exits her 
apartment to inquire about the rent 
from a standoffish upstairs tenant. 
She gets into her cruiser to leave for 
work and is promptly killed in a car-
bomb explosion.
From its opening moments, 
“Briarpatch” presents itself as a 
trope-subverting, 
expectation-
destroying amendment to the neo-
noir genre. Following the disturbing 
explosion sequence, “Briarpatch” 
introduces its reluctant heroine 
Allegra Dill (Rosario Dawson, 
“Luke Cage”) who returns to the 
small Texas town to mourn her 
sister, the murdered detective. 
Allegra sweeps into San Bonifacio, a 
chaotic town plagued by corruption 
and a recent zoo animal breakout, 
with a cool exterior entirely at odds 
with the heat and confusion of her 
surroundings.
As 
Allegra 
digs 
into 
the 
circumstances of her sister’s killing, 
her career as a private investigator 
for 
a 
Senate 
sub-committee 
interferes. She is soon asked by her 
employers to depose an old friend 
Jake Spivey (Jay R. Ferguson, “Mad 
Men”) about his role in an organized 
crime network surrounding an 
elusive fugitive, Clyde Brattle. 

Allegra, compelled by her work 
and complicated feelings for her late 
sister, has no choice but to immerse 
herself back into the town she left 
12 years earlier, after a mysterious 
accident that killed her parents. 
Soon injured in another car-bomb 
explosion, Allegra and her stoic 
composure begin to unravel as she 
delves deeper into San Bonifacio’s 
bizarre world of lies and corruption. 

“Briarpatch,” 
based 
off 
the 
novel of the same name, seeks to 
separate itself from other works of 
the neo-noir genre and present a 
unique response to tired tropes in 
TV crime drama. Dawson shines 
as the guarded and self-assured 
Allegra. Confident and unflinching, 
her character takes the “hardened 
private investigator” role to new 
territory, especially with her status 
as a woman of color in a mainly 

white, Southern town. 
In one scene, Allegra interrogates 
a 
police 
beat 
reporter 
(John 
Aylward, “ER”) over dinner at the 
local press club. Upon seeing her 
charm the Latino wait staff, he 
remarks, “How come they treat you 
like white man?” By acknowledging 
the racist past of its setting and 
genre, “Briarpatch” again subverts 
viewer expectations and skillfully 
places power back into Allegra’s 
hands as a competent and talented 
protagonist.
Part Southern Gothic and part 
surreal, the visuals of “Briarpatch” 
reinforce its impact on audiences. 
The show weaves the worlds of the 
ultra-wealthy and impoverished 
seamlessly into its backdrop to 
create an unmistakably American 
setting. With the added pressures 
of political and economic factors, 
Allegra’s journey to avenge her 
sister works as a representation 
of how difficult navigating the 
country’s moral climate can be. 
“Briarpatch” 
knows 
exactly 
what it is and what it wants to be. 
With this self-awareness in mind, 
the show near-flawlessly resurrects 
the noir genre with equals parts 
grit and levity. The solid cast and 
compelling writing hold up an 
already intriguing premise and 
bring life to a world simultaneously 
real and fantastical. If the beginning 
of “Briarpatch” is any indication, 
the show will continue to captivate 
its audience with its gorgeous 
conspiracies and abundance of zoo 
animals. 

‘Briarpatch’ is a breath of 
fresh air for neo-noir genre

TV REVIEW
TV REVIEW

“West of Arkham the hills rise 
wild,” begins H.P. Lovecraft’s 
famous short story “Color Out of 
Space” and the 2020 film adaptation 
of the same name. The movie starts 
off with the story’s entrancing 
opening passage in which its main 
character, a water surveyor, details 
a particularly creepy woodland 
in Massachusetts. The new film 
sets this monologue to shots of a 
dark, nearly otherworldly forest 
which seems almost normal, if 
not for certain patches of strange 
trees and some deep shadows. 
This scene captures what makes 
Lovecraft’s work so haunting. His 
terrors typically remain unseen, 
but are always felt, lurking in the 
dark. 
The movie departs from all 
of this pretty quickly. From the 
second scene on, “Color Out of 
Space” becomes a mess. Essentially, 
the story is this: a meteorite lands 
on a family’s farm and carries with 
it a life force that mutates the flora 
and fauna around it and grows like 
a cancer. While this sounds like an 
intriguing premise (and makes for 
an amazing short story), the movie 
wastes it. Highbrow, literary sci-fi 
horror is shredded into B-movie 
carnage and camp. Basically, it’s 
as if the team behind “The Room” 
made “Annihilation.” The dialogue 
is atrocious, the characters and 

their decisions are nonsensical 
and, along with some terrible CGI, 
frequently threaten to derail the 
entire movie. 
Yet Nicholas Cage (“Mandy”), 
who plays the father, does what he 
does best and raises this seemingly 
destined-to-be forgotten schlock to 
another sublime level. He gives the 
most Nicholas Cage performance 
possible, filling every one of his 
scenes with (often unintentional) 
hilarity. His wild-eyed, screaming, 

lisping, expletive-hurling, alpaca-
milking persona is so extreme that 
it will live in one’s brain long after 
the plot and all its details have 
disappeared. 
Sadly, however, when Cage isn’t 
on screen, no one else can carry 
his manic weight. The scenes 
without Nicholas Cage in “Color 
Out of Space” mostly drag, with 
characters exchanging abysmal 
dialogue and making exaggerated 

facial expressions to match. The 
screenwriters also must have 
determined that a modern audience 
would have difficulty following the 
relatively simple story, so multiple 
characters spell out what exactly 
is 
happening 
multiple 
times, 
draining the situation of any kind 
of Lovecraftian mystery. Even if 
certain images still retain some 
shocking, cosmic horror, they’re 
frequently deflated by overused 
CGI and bad acting. When a 
hippie character played by Tommy 
Chong (“Cheech and Chong”) tells 
another character in painstaking 
detail what the alien inside the 
meteorite is doing, one can almost 
feel Lovecraft turning in his grave. 
Yet somehow, again and again, 
Nicholas Cage shows up to remind 
us to keep watching. His insanity 
frequently and impossibly eclipses 
itself in each progressive scene. 
He seems to be in an entirely 
different film, though what kind 
is impossible to tell. His personas 
change on a dime, and he flits 
between 
conserative 
farmer, 
drunken dope, psycho murderer 
and tragic hero over the course 
of the story. If anything’s from 
an alien planet, it’s definitely this 
deranged shapeshifter. 
“Color Out of Space” would be a 
great movie for late on Halloween 
night, after a party or two, when 
one can just sit back, half asleep, 
to watch the wild, blood-soaked 
hilarity. It’s pretty terrible but, 
thanks to Nicholas Cage’s heroic 
efforts, pretty terrible in all the 
best ways.

“Do you know what a harlequin 
is? A harlequin’s role is to serve. 
It’s nothing without a master.”
That’s not the case anymore. 
Margot 
Robbie’s 
(“Suicide 
Squad”) Harley Quinn is much, 
much more than that, as she 
proves in the new movie “Birds 
of Prey and the Fantabulous 
Emancipation of One Harley 
Quinn.” 
I had the opportunity to see 
a pre-screening for this movie 
along with several other U of 
M students, and I wasn’t sure 
what to think initially. I hadn’t 
seen “Suicide Squad,” so most of 
my knowledge of Harley Quinn 
was 
from 
Batman 
cartoons, 
“The 
LEGO 
Batman 
Movie” 
and the internet. However, this 
movie reveals so much more of 
her character. Most people only 
really knew her as the “Joker’s 
girlfriend” before this, but in 
this film we find out that he is 
inconsequential in her new life. 
She is truly emancipated from his 

hold on her. She is a new woman, 
doing what she wants to do, living 
with her hyena as company. 
In “Birds of Prey,” we follow 
Harley’s journey in finding a 
diamond for Roman Sionis (Ewan 
McGregor, “Star Wars Episode 
I: The Phantom Menace”). She 

soon learns that a young girl 
named Cassandra Cain (Ella 
Jay Basco, “Teachers”) posseses 
the diamond … and isn’t exactly 
able to just hand it over. To keep 
an eye on Cassandra, Harley 
begins to teach the younger girl 
all about being Harley Quinn. 
She’s like a hilariously psychotic 

older sister. Their blossoming 
relationship is easily one of the 
best things to watch in the film. 
Harley’s plotline is intertwined 
with that of other women, namely 
Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez, 
“Untamed Heart”), Dinah Lance 
(Jurnee Smollett-Bell “One Last 
Thing”) and Helena Bertinelli 
(Mary Elizabeth Winstead, “10 
Cloverfield Lane”), aka the soon-
to-be-dubbed Birds of Prey. 
The fight scenes in this movie 
are incredible. Harley’s unique 
style of hitting people with 
baseball bats and using glitter and 
paint bombs is an amazing way 
of meshing together femininity 
with strength. She doesn’t have to 
give up her glitter in order to kill 
people. It is truly inspirational. 
The other top-tier performance 
in this movie is without a doubt 
Ewan McGregor’s. He manages 
to 
play 
a 
hilarious 
villain 
without making himself seem 
incompetent. 
His 
character, 
Roman Sionis, is always sharply 
dressed, 
utterly 
despicable 
and sinister while wearing an 
innocent smile.

SABRIYA IMAMI
Daily Arts Writer

The genre of indie pop has 
always 
maintained 
a 
code 
of 
individuality, 
given 
its 
roots within the psychedelic 
movement of the ‘60s and 
early ‘70s. It was celebrated 
at the time of its inception for 
introducing a new sound in 
pop, while also preserving the 
“transcendence” mantra that 
stems from the psychedelic 
movement. Its focus was on 
connecting with nature in a 
spiritual 
and 
life-affirming 
manner. 
By the new millennium, 
however, artists like Death Cab 
for Cutie and The Decemberists 
shifted the aims of the genre 
to be about the relationship 
humans have with themselves. 
They began to ask questions 
about the fragility of humanity 
in the face of a world that was 
looking more and more hostile. 
In effect, they changed the 
values of indie pop from being 
outwardly oriented and nature-

driven to introspective and 
individualistic. It seems that 
most people have forgotten the 
original roots of the genre; it 
hasn’t always been about self-
reflection.
Enter Dan Deacon. Though 
the Baltimore-based musician 

first became known as a highly 
subversive, electronic artist 
(the video of him performing 
on local news from 2006 is 
proof), he has since thrust 
himself into the underground 
pop scene. With his newest 
record Mystic Familiar, Deacon 
manages to craft an album 

that brings back the earthen 
spirituality of early indie pop 
while also diving deep into his 
own personal anxieties.
Throughout 
the 
record, 
there 
is 
an 
emphasis 
on 
impermanence, 
particularly 
death and old age. With Deacon 
nearing his 40s, it isn’t all that 
surprising that these matters 
are occupying his thoughts. 
Mystic Familiar acts as a sort 
of 
therapeutic 
solution 
to 
these ideas that have been 
tormenting him. The spiritual 
essence 
of 
nature 
combats 
the questions that haunt him. 
He’s trying to, as the opening 
track title states, “Become a 
Mountain.” If he can convince 
himself that the memory of his 
existence is indomitable like 
a mountain, then old age and 
death become less threatening 
inevitabilities. This idea of 
combating impermanence with 
transcendentalism is a perfect 
marriage between the two 
iterations of indie pop. Deacon 
is looking outward to look 
inward.

of indie pop on his new LP

T

urning points are often 
arbitrary. They are 
judged retroactively, fre-
quently in an attempt to ascribe 
meaning to results rather than 
default to the 
randomness 
of sports.
But if the 
Michigan 
men’s bas-
ketball team 
finds itself 
and rounds 
into form 
here, we will 
look back on 
Saturday’s 
77-68 win over Michigan State 
as a catalyst. Not just because 
the Wolverines beat the Spar-
tans for the first time in nearly 
two years, nor simply because 
Michigan stopped a two-game 
skid and added an all-important 
conference win over a KenPom 
top-15 team.
But because, four months into 
the season, we still don’t know 
how good this team can be with 
Isaiah Livers on the floor. Liv-
ers returned Saturday from 
an injury; he’d sat eight of the 
previous nine games, of which 
Michigan lost six. With Livers 
in the lineup, Michigan started 
the year by winning 11 of 14 
games, including a win over No. 
2 Gonzaga in the Bahamas.
In 31 minutes against the 
Spartans, Livers scored 14 
points and made 2-of-5 attempts 
from 3-point range. He did not 
play in the teams’ first matchup 
on Jan. 5, an 87-69 loss in East 
Lansing.
“We already said it after — 
(with) me or not, this game was 
going to be a tone-setter,” Liv-
ers said. “... We didn’t get rat-
tled at all. We were just excited 
to come out with the ‘W’. It was 
meaningful for us.”
Livers did not play in the Jan. 
5 loss, but Saturday he helped 
direct a defensive game plan 
that was executed to perfection. 
His defensive prowess aside, 
Livers’ steadying presence 

alone adds a layer of comfort 
this team needs right now.
“When you’ve got coaches, 
players, especially, that’s been 
around for a little bit, like me, 
(Zavier Simpson) and (Jon 
Teske), we’ve been here,” Livers 
said. “We can adjust.”
Livers, to his credit, has been 
just about everywhere and done 
just about everything in his 
three years at Michigan. He 
took a starting gig from a senior 
midseason and then started in 
the Final Four during his fresh-
man campaign; he was subse-
quently upended by a freshman 
the year after, and so he moved 
back to the bench without a 
fuss. He’s won conference titles; 
he’s lost them, too. He’s battled 

confidence issues and mental 
lows; he’s endured a coaching 
change; he’s re-shaped his body 
and his game; he’s evolved into 
one of college basketball’s best 
shooters. And you 
just get the sense 
the story of his 
collegiate career 
is still to be writ-
ten.
Michigan lost 
plenty you can 
see when Livers 
was out. Tak-
ing a 50-percent 
3-point shooter 
out of the lineup 
causes spatial issues that are 
aesthetically obvious. That loss 
is compounded by the dearth of 

wing depth on the roster. For all 
of Brandon Johns Jr.’s merits, 
there is no like-for-like replace-
ment for Livers on the roster — 
no one else who can both defend 
three differ-
ent positions 
and stretch 
defenses on 
the other end. 
The Wolver-
ines shot 29.6 
percent from 
3-point range 
in the eight 
games Livers 
was sidelined. 
If extrapolated 
out to the full season, that fig-
ure would rank them dead last 
in the conference.

There’s also plenty we can’t 
see when Livers is out. Here’s a 
subtle example. This is how Isa-
iah Livers answered a question 
about transition defense:
“The best thing I can do is 
direct traffic. We have young 
guys that, as they sprint back, 
they don’t know what to do. 
I’m already back, talking, just 
pointing and directing them. 
‘Go to that area, I’ll go to this 
area, go up there and guard the 
ball.’ 
“Just little things like that 
can help. I think we need more 
of that.”
“Little things” are precisely 
what’s plagued this team most 
all year.
“We missed him a lot, and we 

missed having another guy like 
Zay,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said, “who can not only 
make shots but also a guy that 
has a higher basketball IQ, that 
knows how to make plays.”
Veterans matter in college 
basketball, as Tom Izzo remind-
ed us when he so eloquently 
groveled about how his fresh-
man “just aren’t ready.” There’s 
a reason why the successful 
teams in the one-and-done 
eras are rarely littered with 
one-and-done players. For all 
the cringeworthy abuse of this 
phrase, Isaiah Livers is a win-
ning player.
But is it that simple? Are the 
flaws that plagued and nearly 
killed Michigan in his absence 
simply in the rearview?
Saturday certainly was a step 
in the right direction. Presum-
ing the Wolverines take care of 
their next two games (at North-
western and home to Indiana), 
they’ll have clawed back to .500 
in conference play. They’ll head 
to Rutgers — a team they’ve 
already beaten on a neutral 
court — brimming with con-
fidence. For the first time all 
year, they’ll likely have every-
one healthy and happy. 
If that comes to fruition, 
they’ll be a team no one wants 
to play in March. And they’ll 
certainly point to Saturday’s 
win over Michigan State as a 
paradigm shift.
It could just as easily prove a 
momentary boon, Livers’ return 
plugging only one hole on a 
sinking ship. Saturday’s result 
could just as easily say more 
about where Michigan State is 
than anything else.
Is Saturday a sign of things 
to come or a mirage? Will Liv-
ers’ return prove to be a turning 
point or merely a momentary 
respite? 
We’ll have to wait two more 
months to pen that narrative.

Livers is back. Can Michigan change its season?

Sweeping through South Florida
Michigan notches five straight wins, getting past Fresno State with Hoogenraad walk-off to cap undefeated USF Invitational

Michigan softball needed a 
hero moment.
Against Fresno State, in the 
bottom of the ninth inning, locked 
in a scoreless tie, senior outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad stepped up to 
the plate. 
Pinch-running 
for 
Taylor 
Bump, freshman utility player 
Lauren Esman was on third, 
advancing from second on a 
sacrifice bunt after being placed 
there via international tiebreaker.
With seemingly no effort, 
Hoogenraad drilled the ball into 
the right-center field gap — where 
it fell between the Bulldogs’ right 
fielder Kelsey Hall and center 
fielder 
Mckenzie 
Wilson. 
As 
Esman crossed home, the extra-
innings were over, the game 
finished. Michigan 1, Fresno State 
0 — the final win in the Wolverines 
perfect 5-0 weekend at the USF-
Rawlings Invitational.
“I was just thinking about 
trying to stick to my game plan, 
stuff that we had talked about in 
the dugout, stuff that we knew 
the 
pitcher 
was 
throwing,” 
Hoogenraad said. “I tried to 
remember that if I didn’t get it 
done, that my teammate would get 

it done behind me.”
Hoogenraad’s heroic moment 
was indicative of her success 
over the entire weekend. She 
accumulated four runs and three 
RBI en route to a .429 batting 
average over five games. She also 
had four doubles on the weekend.
“She didn’t hit particularly 
well in our preseason practices 
and really she came out (this 
weekend),” Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins said. “I thought she 
cleared her mind and she knows 
she can hit the 
ball. 
She 
was 
just 
one-pitch 
focused.”
Starting 
all 
five games in 
center 
field, 
Hoogenraad 
again 
proved 
her ability at the 
plate and in the 
field. 
During 
Saturday’s game 
against Florida she robbed a grand 
slam with a catch over the wall. 
Against the Gators she went 2-for-
3, with three runs and two runs 
batted-in. During Friday’s game 
against Georgia State, she totaled 
one run, contributing to the 6-1 
victory.
Despite 
an 
overall 
stellar 

performance, her highs couldn’t 
come without their lows. Against 
Illinois State she went 0-for-3, 
only getting on base after a walk. 
“They’re independent things,” 
Hoogenraad said. “You can only 
control the one pitch, and I think 
the biggest thing to focus on all 
the time is that how you have been 
doing or what you’ve been doing, 
doesn’t necessarily dictate what 
you’re going to do.”
Hoogenraad’s response to the 
ups and downs was echoed by the 
rest of the team. 
Playing five games 
over a span of 
three days could 
be 
challenging 
for some teams. 
Instead, Michigan 
capitalized on its 
initial momentum 
against 
Georgia 
State, its opening 
game 
of 
the 
season.
Michigan hasn’t won all five 
games of its opening weekend 
series since 2012. In a true team 
effort, the Wolverines’ success can 
be attributed to their commitment 
to staying level.
“I think our best quality was 
that we didn’t get too high and we 
don’t get too low,” Hutchins said. 
“We just slug away one pitch at a 
time. We were playing some of the 
best one-pitch softball I’ve seen in 
a while. We didn’t let our tough 
times hitting the ball get to us. It’s 
a great quality, it can make a great 
team really good.”
Hoogenrad’s hit came during 
a clutch moment in Michigan’s 
lows. Being able to rely on a 
player during the pitfalls to 
break through the wall and make 
big plays can be instrumental 
throughout the course of a season.
If 
Hoogenrad’s 
personal 
success this weekend is in any 
way indicative of her upcoming 
season, she’s going to be a player 
to watch out for. After graduating 
five starting seniors last year, 
Michigan is looking to fill the gaps 
in its lineup. With tremendous 
athleticism in the outfield coupled 
with a high batting average, she 
might be the senior leader the 
Wolverines are looking for.

Sophomore catcher Hannah 
Carson stood at the plate, dialed 
in. Florida’s Natalie Lugo readied 
her pitch and delivered. The ball 
rocketed off Carson’s bat through 
the right side of the infield — two 
runs scored.
The two runs marked the 
beginning of No. 17 Michigan 
softball team’s (5-0) signature 
win over No. 7 Florida (4-1) in 
its opening weekend at the USF-
Rawlings 
Invitational. 
With 
two outs, the runs broke the 
floodgates open in a five-run first 
inning en route to an 11-2, run-
rule victory in the Wolverines’ 
first marquee game of the season. 
“Our first inning was huge,” 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
said. 
“And 
obviously, 
the 
opponent, when you’re down by 
something in the first inning, it 
affects their ability to be free. 
And we did a good job of we just 
kept coming at them.”
The Wolverines certainly kept 
coming.
Michigan went undefeated 
on the weekend in Tampa, also 
notching wins against Georgia 
State (1-3), Illinois State (1-4), 
South Florida (0-4) and Fresno 
State (3-2). The five wins came 
across a three-day slate, which 
included 
doubleheaders 
on 
Friday and Saturday.
Spearheading the Wolverines’ 
weekend 
success 
were 
sophomore right-hander Alex 
Storako and junior left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien.
Storako opened Michigan’s 
season Friday afternoon against 
Georgia State by throwing a 
career-high 16 strikeouts in a 
complete game. She allowed 
just five hits and one run in a 
6-1 victory over the Panthers. 
Storako also pitched innings 
against Illinois State, Florida 
and Fresno State for a weekend 
earned-run-average of 1.0.
“I felt really good,” Storako 
said. “I was able to throw one 
pitch at a time. It was really nice 
to really rely on my defense and 
having a lot of trust in them back 
there.”

Beaubien found her stride 
as well, earning wins against 
Illinois State, the University 
of South Florida and Fresno 
State. Beaubien finished the 
weekend with 21 strikeouts and 
four earned runs in 16 innings 
pitched.
On 
the 
offensive 
side, 
Michigan found its bats early. 
The Wolverines averaged 1.4 
runs in the first inning and 2.6 
runs in the first three innings.
“Hitting 
is 
contagious,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“We get a few 
hits, 
and 
it 
frees everybody 
up 
because 
they don’t feel 
pressure.”
Production 
came 
from 
everywhere, but 
Michigan 
had 
some 
notable 
standouts. 
Junior first baseman Lou 
Allan batted .375 with two home 
runs, four RBI and four runs 
over the weekend. Allan made 
a statement with her hitting 
opening weekend after missing 
a large part of her sophomore 
season due to injury, proving 
her value in the starting lineup. 
Junior Morgan Overaitis hit .588 
over the three-day invitational, 
contributing three runs and 
three RBI to the Wolverine 
offense.
Senior 
outfielder 
Haley 
Hoogenraad hit .429 with four 
runs and three RBI, sparking 
the back-end of the batting 
order in the seventh slot. Her 
third RBI came as a walk-off 
single in the bottom of the ninth 
against Fresno State on Sunday 
to claim Michigan’s 1-0 victory 
and preserve its perfect record 
coming back to Ann Arbor.
But the heroics weren’t only 
left to Hoogenraad.
“Our pitchers got us out of 
it,” Hutchins said. “Our pitchers 
did everything they could so we 
could find a way to muster up a 
run. I was very pleased with the 
pitchers.”
Over the five game stretch, the 
lineup also seemed to solidify — a 

lineup that was not set, according 
to Hutchins, a week ahead of the 
invitational. One new player who 
appeared to claim her spot was 
freshman Julia Jimenez.
Jimenez, the 20th-ranked 2019 
recruit by FloSoftball, saw starts 
at second base and designated 
player. Jimenez played in all five 
games — the only freshman to do 
so — and contributed on both the 
offensive and defensive sides of 
the ball for the Wolverines.
“It’s why we recruit people,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“We want them to 
come in. We don’t 
want them to take 
their 
freshman 
year off. We want 
them to come in 
and 
contribute. 
I 
think 
she’s 
definitely a kid 
who’s ready to 
contribute at this 
level. She had a 
really strong weekend for us.”
As a team, the Wolverines 
overcame 
any 
uncertainties 
they had entering their opening 
weekend. The only question 
that remains is how they’ll build 
on the impressive start — with 
continued success or a fall back 
to earth.

‘M’ holds off 
Michigan 
State, 77-68, 
in win

When Michigan went to East Lansing in 
early January, it was ugly. The Wolverines 
didn’t seem to have answers for anything 
that Michigan State threw their way. 
They couldn’t contain the volatile 
Spartan offense, led by star senior point 
guard Cassius Winston and junior forward 
Xavier Tillman. Their own offense was 
lost without junior forward Isaiah Livers. 
Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo 
seemed to quite literally have their number 
at every turn. Michigan drowned in the 
chaos of the Breslin Center. 
Saturday in Ann Arbor was a different 
story. 
Michigan State was still Michigan State. 
Winston and Tillman were still Winston 
and Tillman; Tom Izzo was still Tom Izzo. 
But with Livers back and a home crowd 
decked out in maize behind them, the 
Wolverines finally had some answers.
Michigan (14-9 overall, 5-7 Big Ten) 
managed to grit out a win over the 
16th-ranked Spartans, 77-68, on Saturday 
as Livers and sophomore guard David 
DeJulius led a 3-point-heavy offense 
and the defense did enough to propel 
the Wolverines past an unusually quiet 
Michigan State (16-8, 8-5).
“Any time you can beat those guys, it 
feels amazing,” senior center Jon Teske 
said. “Especially being a senior, (point 
guard Zavier Simpson) and I, this may be 
our last time playing them. It’s special.
“We just had to come out from the 
start. And that’s what we did. Just start to 
finish, everyone played well; defensively, 
offensively.”
Livers made his return to the starting 
lineup, his re-aggravated groin injury 
healed, to the delight of the Crisler Center 
crowd. His offensive presence, tipping 
rebounds and firing off passes, was felt 
immediately. When he put up a three 
from in front of the Spartan bench to give 
Michigan an early 6-3 lead, the arena 
erupted.
“[Livers] makes this team better in many 
ways,” Simpson said. “His leadership, his 
voice. On the offensive end, he spreads the 
floor. He can attack. It’s just his presence. 
“Sometimes it’s not about the stat sheet, 
or anything else. Sometimes it’s just about 
someone’s presence, and I think Isaiah 
definitely gave us a confidence boost before 
the game.”
The Wolverines needed Livers to 
return some spark to the offense that 
had been inconsistent at best in his 
prolonged absence. With Livers back, but 
wearing a brace, the offense channeled 
the junior forward’s tenacity, and against 
one of Michigan’s toughest conference 
opponents, it worked. Behind a series of 
drained 3-pointers and a solid defensive 
effort, the Wolverines managed to take a 
29-23 lead into halftime.
The second half was even harder-
fought. Coming out of the break, the 
Spartans seemed to find the shots they 
weren’t making in the first half, and they 
brought it to a one-point margin by the 
under-16 timeout. 
But Michigan remained unshaken, 
getting junior guard Eli Brooks the look 
he wanted on a pass from Simpson. The 
resulting 3-pointer found nothing but 
the sweet swish of nylon. They allowed a 
layup to freshman guard Rocket Watts, 
but followed up with a Simpson layup and 
a massive one-handed dunk from Teske on 
a perfect alley-oop from Brooks.
“Eli and I locked eyes, and I saw him 
throw it up, and I went up and got it — 
I’m not really sure how,” Teske laughed. 
“I’m not really sure how I got it, but I saw 
enough.”
This time around, Michigan finally had 
the answers that had been missing. The 
factors that cost them the game in January 
were still present. But they weren’t game-
deciders. Instead of allowing Winston 
and Tillman to dictate the game, the 
Wolverines did that themselves.
“Every player is not always going to be 
perfect,” Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
said. “But I loved the way we were able to 
respond when we did make mistakes.”
After dropping their previous three 
conference home games to Penn State, 
Illinois and Ohio State, in a conference 
where defending home court has been 
essential this season, it was a statement win 
this Michigan team badly needed. Until 
this game, much of its tournament resume 
was based off wins in late November 
and early December, and the slump that 
encompassed most of January was far 
from a glowing endorsement.
Two-and-a-half 
months 
later, 
the 
Wolverines seem to have rediscovered the 
clutch genes that lifted them to those non-
conference wins, if only for an afternoon. 
With a demanding conference schedule 
yet ahead of them, if they can continue to 
deliver like they did on Saturday, there may 
yet be enough momentum to carry them 
through March.

As Zavier Simpson sat quietly 
watching 
film, 
one 
pervading 
thought kept tugging away at his 
psyche.
He diligently 
watched 
game 
after game of Michigan falling to 
Michigan State over the course of 
his career, and had one nagging 
idea staring him right in the face: 
If the senior and unequivocal 
leader of this team hits a few more 
3-pointers, the Wolverines flip the 
script.
Four straight losses over the last 
two seasons against a bitter rival 
become wins — or at least closer 
games — and Simpson is cemented 
as one of the greatest to ever throw 
on a maize and blue jersey, if only 
the ball falls through the hoop a 
few more times.
Simpson knew he had one more 
opportunity in his career to change 
the narrative around the rivalry, 
his 3-point shooting ability and 
his place in Michigan basketball 
history. And that chance sat behind 
the 3-point line.
So what did the senior do?
One of the worst statistical 
3-point shooters on the Wolverines 
temporarily squashed all doubt and 
went 4-for-7 from beyond the arc to 
put the Spartans away, 77-68, and 
finish with a team-high 16 points.
For Simpson, it all boiled down 
to confidence.
Whether it came from playing 
on his home court or a desire to put 
recent controversy surrounding 

his one-game suspension to rest, 
Simpson was a different player on 
the floor than from games of the 
rivalry’s recent past. The last time 
the senior faced Michigan State 
on Jan. 5, he limped his way to a 
1-for-6 performance from 3-point 
land. The confidence was clearly 
missing.
“I just wanted to come out 
and play confident,” Simpson 
said. “I watched a lot of film 
from last year’s games and the 
previous game where we played 
them earlier in the season, and 
I just wanted to come out and 
be confident in my shot. I’m 
confident in my shot, my coaches 
trust me, my teammates trust me. 
I wanted to just come in there 
and knock ‘em down. At the same 
time, don’t take it personal, try to 
make smart plays.”
Confidence 
aside, 
it 
is 
unimaginable 
the 
game 
plan 
revolved around Simpson rising 
up and drilling 3-pointers. Simply 
put, sets where Simpson shoots 
3-pointers are typically not smart 
plays.
His career mark from beyond 
the arc is a measly 31 percent, and 
the Wolverines were significantly 
helped in that regard with the 
return of junior forward Isaiah 
Livers. 
On paper, the plan can recently 
be derived as creating open looks 
for Livers and other more prolific 
shooters on the roster. On the 
floor, it played out as forcing the 
Spartans into making defensive 
errors and fighting for every 50-50 

ball in order to generate more 
offensive looks for Michigan.
Simpson 
was 
clearly 
the 
benefactor 
of 
this 
change 
in 
fortune.
Ironically, 
the 
plays 
that 
never originated in coach Juwan 
Howard’s 
playbook 
ended 
up 
all but sealing the game for the 
Wolverines.
“There was nothing I was doing, 
it was all about the players,” 
Howard said. “Zavier made some 
tough shots, but he was open, and 
those are shots that he’s practiced. 
Those are shots that he comes in on 
off days and shoots, and it’s good to 
see that during the game. He was 
confident. 
“I want him as well as his 
other teammates, when they’re 
open to don’t be afraid to take the 
open shot. If they miss a shot, my 
philosophy is if you get another 
open one, take the next one.”
What makes that philosophy 
work — whenever it actually does — 
is that it’s tough to defend. How are 
you going to game plan for a system 
that empowers all of its team’s 
shooters? All of them. Not just 
those who specialize in the craft.
Maybe that’s why when wrapping 
up his post game press conference, 
Spartans coach Tom Izzo queued 
the audience into his surprise over 
how the game played out:
“Some guys hit some shots that 
they weren’t supposed to.”
On Saturday, that was Simpson. 
And it all started in a Crisler Center 
film room, staring down the root of 
the problem.

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Senior guard Zavier Simpson scored 16 points including four 3-pointers in Michigan’s 77-68 win over Michigan State on Saturday.

Livers’ 
return gives 
Wolverines 
a boost

Isaiah Livers was giving out high-
fives courtside.
Moments earlier, the junior forward 
— in his first game back since re-injuring 
his groin against Illinois two weeks 
ago — had supplied the final nail in 
Michigan State’s coffin. Showing no 
signs of his former impediment, Livers 
rose up and swatted Aaron Henry’s 
layup attempt off the backboard and 
into Wolverine hands. 
Now, with just 1:42 remaining, his 
team up by nine and freshman forward 
Franz Wagner at the foul line, he could 
bask in the triumph — a 77-68 win over 
the Spartans. 
“It felt good,” Livers said. “It 
honestly didn’t matter who we were 
playing. Whether we were playing non-
conference, low-major, a non-D1 team, I 
was just excited about getting back out 
there. All the work you put in, the love 
you have your teammates and the game 
of basketball, I just wanted to get back.” 
While Michigan was able to weather 
Livers’ most-recent absence, going 2-1, 
his return was a welcomed sign for a 
team that lost by 18 in East Lansing last 
month.
He missed his first two shots — both 
from beyond the arc — but settled 
into the game on the defensive end 
rather quickly. A block and steal 
within the first three minutes was an 
early indication that he was up for the 
challenge. Gradually, that effort paid 
off on the other end of the floor too, 
knocking down two 3-pointers and a 
pair of free throws in the first half. 
“I was proud of the way he came 
out and competed,” Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard said. “There were some 
possessions out there where it was 
tough for us to score and (Isaiah) came 
up big and made some clutch shots. 
Defensively, he was very active with his 
length in protecting the basket. It was 
good that we had opportunities we had 
to switch ball screens and he was able to 
keep a man in front of him.”
Even though Livers tweaked his 
groin on a dunk attempt against the 
Illini, he showed no apprehension in 
attacking the rim against the Spartans. 
Just 12 minutes into the game, he went 
right at Michigan State’s Malik Hall for 
an attempted slam, landing harder than 
most Wolverines’ fans would’ve liked.
“I’m still going to attack with a lot 
of force, go up and finish, do what I 
do,” Livers said with a smirk. “I know I 
said I wasn’t going to try to dunk but I 
definitely tried in the first half and got 
fouled. But I let go of the rim so there 
was no tragedy there.”
Livers played 18 minutes in the first 
half and 31 in total, second to only 
Wagner. Over the past few weeks, it was 
clear Howard and his staff weren’t going 
to rush Livers back too soon, regardless 
of which direction the Wolverines were 
trending. But, when he was ready to go, 
they weren’t going to hold him back at 
all either. 
“Not with coach Howard,” Livers 
said. “He’s a winner man. And I don’t 
even believe in that because you go out 
there, you’re just giving half, you come 
out and you’re like a liability out there. 
I like to go out there, zero to 100. I can’t 
play 75 percent. I told coach Howard 
this, too, and he agreed with me. He 
said ‘Go out there and if you’re tired, tug 
that jersey.’ ”
Livers’ 
contribution 
went 
well 
beyond his 14 points and four boards 
though. With his return, Michigan 
got back another floor general. In the 
Wolverines’ last matchup against the 
Spartans, they gave up 21 points in 
transition. This time they gave up just 
six. Livers’ guidance on defense was a 
big reason why. 
“The best thing I can do is direct 
traffic,” Livers said. “We have young 
guys that as they sprint back they don’t 
know what to do. I’m already back, 
talking, just pointing and directing 
them. ‘Go to that area, I’ll go to this 
area, go up there and guard the ball.’ 
Just little things like that can help. I 
think we need more of that.”
Beating the Spartans now gives 
Michigan yet another opportunity to 
gain some momentum as it heads into 
the final weeks of the regular season. 
Getting Livers back healthy almost felt 
like a win in and of itself. 
While they’ve scraped by just enough 
without him, it goes without saying that 
the Wolverines are at their best when 
he’s available. Saturday proved that 
once again. 
“(Isaiah) is a talent, it’s that simple,” 
Howard said. “We missed him a lot. We

Simpson’s shooting ignites rivalry win

For better or worse, Juwan Howard 
had a feeling Saturday would dictate 
the direction of the Wolverines’ 
season.
Before 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team left its locker room 
to face No. 16 Michigan State, the 
first-year coach called it a “tone-
setter.” Following a sub-.500 month 
defined by Isaiah Livers’ absence, 
the junior forward returned to the 
Wolverines’ lineup for the much-
anticipated in-state rivalry.
His presence, Michigan hoped, 
would be a tone-setter of its own. 
The first few minutes of the game, 
however, 
looked 
anything 
but 
promising.
The Wolverines missed 10 of 
their first 11 shots. Three minutes 
elapsed before they scored. In the 
midst of a three-game losing streak 
in which Michigan hadn’t shot 
above 40 percent from the field, it 
appeared Saturday would set a tone 
in the worst possible way.
But after a slow start, a 3-pointer 
from senior point guard Zavier 
Simpson — who entered the game 
as a 29-percent 3-point shooter 
in conference play — gave the 
Wolverines their first lead. He 
followed it up by burying his next 
two attempts, giving Michigan a 
lead it wouldn’t relinquish in an 
eventual 77-68 win.
In the process, he set the tone 
Howard sought.

“This game was going to be a 
tone-setter,” Livers said. “I think 
we all did a good job coming out 
focused and staying disciplined to 
what the coaches believe we can do 
and the stuff that we do in practice. 
There’s no reason to get away from 
it. We weren’t rattled at all, we were 
just excited to come out with the 
‘W.’ It was meaningful for us.”
Following a three-week span that 
included two losses at the buzzer 
and a narrow double-overtime win, 
Saturday proved to be exactly what 
the Wolverines needed. They played 
with the lead for nearly 35 minutes, 
trailing only at a score of 1-0.
“A lot of downers (lately),” Livers 
said. “A lot of games that came down 
to free throws. … Just little stuff 
that we did at the end of the close 
game was just like, ‘Dang, man, we 
could’ve had it.’ We put a lot of work 
in and I think it was good for us to 
actually see that all the work we put 
in in the gym actually works during 
the game time, so I was very happy 
with that.”
Just over a month ago, Michigan 
was run out of East Lansing in an 
18-point blowout. Twenty-one of 
Michigan State’s points came in 
transition. Whether it was a product 
of the team’s lack of communication, 
mental lapses or the Spartans’ 
sheer will, it ultimately defined the 
Wolverines’ most lopsided loss of 
the season.
“It was very disappointing how 
our transition defense failed us the 
last time we played Michigan State,” 

Howard said. “As I recall, we gave 
up 21 points in transition because we 
were not good at communicating. … 
It was a big emphasis on me as well 
as my staff (today) on taking away 
some of those transition buckets 
because Michigan State does a 
really good job.”
On 
Saturday, 
they 
held 
Michigan 
State 
to 
just 
six 
fastbreak 
points. 
Michigan 
suffocated 
Spartans’ 
guard 
Cassius Winston, who poured in a 
career-high 32 points in their last 
meeting, to the tune of a dismal 
5-of-18 shooting performance.
Howard’s 
responsibilities 
aren’t limited to just X’s and O’s, 
though. On Saturday, he took it 
upon himself to set a tone of his 
own.
“(Howard) is loud coming out 
of that coaching room,” Livers 
said. “You can hear him, already 
pumped up, like he’s about to play. 
… This dude is all up in your face 
like, ‘Let’s go, let’s go!” As a player, 
when you see that you got a coach 
that’s in your face — I don’t know 
about for other people, but my 
opinion is that I love it. When he’s 
got energy, we’ve got to match it.”
Howard wanted Saturday to 
be a tone-setter. The Wolverines 
delivered. Now, it becomes a matter 
of 
whether 
the 
tone 
becomes 
permanent.
“(Saturday) was huge,” Livers 
said. “Like I said, I think it’s a tone-
setter. It’s letting the Big Ten know, 
don’t overlook Michigan.”

2020 TANNER LECTURE ON HUMAN VALUES
Michigan earns sweep with 5-3 win

Less than five minutes into 
the third period Saturday night, 
senior forward Jacob Hayhurst 
went hunting solo.
He entered the attacking 
zone near the left side, with 
multiple defenders headed his 
way. Hayhurst quickly got to 
the net to set up his trap. He had 
the puck stretched far and away, 
which lured goaltender Daniel 
Lebedeff to bite left. But then 
Hayhurst seamlessly brought 
the puck back in and across to 
finish the job backhanded.
That 
goal 
widened 
the 
Michigan hockey team’s lead to 
three in an eventual 5-3 victory 
over Wisconsin (10-17-1 overall, 
5-14-1-1 Big Ten). The outcome 
helped the Wolverines (13-12-3, 
8-8-2-1) seal their second sweep 
of the new year.
After the 8-4 victory on 
Friday, Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson 
was 
disappointed 
in how his team performed 
despite the wide margin of 
victory. Preparation, defense, 
turnovers 
and 
effort 
were 
areas that troubled him. But on 
Saturday — Pearson’s birthday 
— he saw improvement.
“Better 
effort 
tonight,” 
Pearson said. “Even though you 
could look at the score and say, 
well better effort? But we did. 
We played with more urgency 
and they played hard, too, 
tonight. I thought it was a good 
game.”
Less than six minutes into 
the contest, senior forward 
Nick Pastujov won a faceoff in 
his team’s defensive zone. Soon 
after, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Keaton Pehrson got the puck 
and went on the attack. He took 
a shot at the left side of the net 
that Lebedeff appeared to have 
under control, but then Pehrson 
crashed in to grab a quick 
rebound and score through 
Lebedeff’s legs.
Michigan extended its lead 
with 
under 
three 
minutes 
to go in the first frame. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert 
skated 
the 
puck 
down the right side of the 
offensive zone, with freshman 
forward Nick Granowicz on 

his left. Granowicz grabbed the 
opposing defense’s attention, 
getting close to the crease. 
Lambert then swung the 
puck across the ice, to senior 
forward Jake Slaker who came 
trailing in down the left side. 
Without 
hesitation, 
Slaker 
rifled the puck into the net to 
double the margin.
Nearing the end of the 
opening period, the Wolverines 
went on their first penalty kill 
of the night after Summers 
got called for roughing. The 
Badgers made the most of the 
extra man.

Sophomore 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann 
collected 
a 
loose puck near the goal line 
and handed it over to senior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin. 
Martin wrapped around the net 
and attempted a pass across the 
low slot, but it hit an opposing 
player right in front of the 
crease. Right away, forward 
Cole Caufield sent a pass to 
forward Max Zimmer who 
found twine from the left side 
with less than six seconds to go 
in the first frame.
Michigan returned from the 
initial intermission ready to go. 
Less than two minutes into the 
second frame, Summers helped 
his team regain the two-goal 
lead. Lambert collected the 
puck at the far left side of the 
goal line and sent it directly 
backwards to the blue line. 
Summers was waiting there, 
and soon took a strong shot that 
sounded the buzzer.
After that goal, Slaker got 
a 
one-on-one 
opportunity 
with Lebedoff but couldn’t 
convert. And a short while later, 
Pastujov’s shot clanked off the 
right post.
Both 
goaltenders 
got 
involved with seven minutes 

remaining in the second period, 
starting with Lebedeff. He 
charged far away from the 
net and dove to flick the puck 
away before a streaking Slaker 
could touch it. And then right 
away, forward Sean Dhooghe 
went on a rush but crashed into 
Mann with force. Dhooghe got 
called for charging, sending the 
Wolverines on their sole power 
play of the night. Michigan 
couldn’t convert.
Each side faced calamity in 
the final frame. First, Lambert 
dove to try and block a passing 
lane near his goal but then hit 
the boards awkwardly. And a 
bit later, Dhooghe collided with 
Beecher in the neutral zone 
and hit the ground hard. Both 
needed help coming off the ice 
and never returned.
“We won’t know much till 
Monday or Tuesday,” Pearson 
said of Lambert’s injury. “I’d 
say he’s questionable for the 
weekend. I don’t think it’s, 
hopefully as bad as what it was. 
But they’ll look at him, probably 
some time tomorrow. But we 
need him. I mean, he was really 
good. But again, it’s next man 
up, that’s what we need to do 
and injuries are part of the 
game.”
Wisconsin tallied a second 
goal midway through the final 
period when forward Linus 
Weissbach found the puck near 
the crease for a tap-in. And then 
with just over a minute left, 
defenseman 
K’Andre 
Miller 
fired a shot from the right side 
to bring the game within one 
while Lebedeff was pulled.
But by then the Wolverines 
had enough separation that it 
didn’t matter. Lebedeff stayed 
on the sidelines as the Badgers 
tried to level the game, and 
sophomore forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe notched an empty-netter 
with six seconds remaining for 
the final say.
“It’s late in the season and 
as you can see in the standings, 
it’s 
really 
tight, 
so 
every 
game counts,” Hayhurst said. 
“Obviously a sweep just lifts 
morale in the room and makes 
everyone that (much) more 
happy and makes them want 
to work that much harder to 
continue to win.”

Jack Summers and Keaton Pehrson add offense from defense in win

Last season, two of the five top 
point scorers for the Michigan 
hockey team were defensemen. 
It was part of the system — 
defensemen creating offense — an 
emphasis coach Mel Pearson made 
sure to call out after Michigan 
swept Notre Dame in mid-January.
It was the reason for its success 
then, 
and 
against 
Wisconsin, 
Saturday, 
a 
defensive 
pairing 
stepped up to fit that role in the 5-3 
win to seal another sweep.
Jack Summers and Keaton 
Pehrson have had their fair share 
of disappointment. 
Against Ohio State the prior 
weekend, Summers made a dive 
for a loose puck that jeopardized 
his defensive positioning. The 
Buckeyes scored off his turnover, 

sealing the game in their favor. 
Pehrson had a puck deflect off 
his skate against the Wolverines’ 
last matchup with the Badgers to 
convert a game-winning goal for 
Wisconsin.
But 
Saturday, 
the 
two 
generated 
much-needed 
offense in a 
high-scoring 
affair.
“Both 
(Pehrson) and 
(Summers) 
have to be a 
little 
more 
aggressive,” Pearson said. “They 
play a lot of hockey, our team has 
done extremely well and they 
continue to play as a good solid 
pair.”

Pehrson opened the scoring 
by tapping in a rebound from a 
poor goaltender catch. Wisconsin 
Daniel Lebedeff saw Pehrson 
approach and swing his body to 
face the defenseman. Pehrson saw 
his options. He had a 
teammate waiting on 
his far side, but there 
were 
two 
Badger 
skaters in front of him, 
blocking the passing 
lane.
He took the smart 
approach, 
a 
simple 
flick on net to see if 
the goaltender would 
slip-up. And Lebedeff 
did. He dropped the 
puck and was unable to cover it 
immediately. Upon seeing the error, 
Pehrson perked with excitement 
and drove in with his stick for a 
tap-in goal — the first of his career.

Pehrson 
has 
never 
been 
pegged as an offensive-minded 
defenseman. He’s stout defensively 
and plays fundamentally — to the 
point where Pearson noted he’s one 
of the only players Pearson doesn’t 
harp on in-game 
for his defense.
But Saturday, he 
played aggressive 
and 
determined, 
and it resulted in 
a goal.
On the other 
hand, 
Summers, 
his defensive-pair 
partner, 
focused 
on controlling the 
aggression. Often 
times, he would play the puck too 
forcefully and if the puck didn’t 
bounce his way, the opposing team 
would create a Grade-A breakaway. 
But he sat back and played a safer 

game to ensure his turnovers 
wouldn’t be costly.
And playing at the point, he 
received the puck near the start of 
the second period and swung it on 
target.
“Honestly, 
I 
was just trying 
to get something 
on 
the 
net,” 
Summers said. “I 
wasn’t expecting 
it to go in.”
The 
purpose 
of the play was 
to 
spread 
the 
defense out for 
an easier time to 
crash the crease 
for rebounds. The Badger skaters 
had packed center ice. Freshman 
forward 
Nick 
Granowicz 
recognized this and played the 
puck low to high to create space, 

passing it out to Summers camped 
at the point. Summers simply 
wanted to send it to the net so one 
of them could make the play. But 
instead, he scored.
Head held high, arms around 
his 
teammates, 
Summers’ 
celebration couldn’t have been any 
more contrasting to the look of 
disappointment he had shown just 
last week, wearing his head deep 
into his gloves after his turnover. 
And the first one to his side was his 
partner, Pehrson.
“We’ve been trying to play 
well together and to get a couple 
points really helps our confidence,” 
Pehrson said. “So it felt good.”
Added Pearson: “They don’t 
get the press or the coverage 
or the points the other guys do. 
But they’re a solid pair for us. A 
freshman and a sophomore, they’re 
doing well.”
