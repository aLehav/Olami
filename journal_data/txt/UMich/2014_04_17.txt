Title IX inquiry to
examine 'U'sexual
misconduct policies
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Officials from the Department
of Education's Office of Civil
Rights are on campus until today
as part of an ongoing Title IX
investigation at the University.
The investigation spurred
by an August 2013 complaint
from former University profes-
sor Douglas Smith, who lodged
a complaint with the department
in connection with a 2009 sexual
misconduct case involving for-
mer kicker Brendan Gibbons. In
his complaint, Smith alleged that
the University did not respond in
a timely manner to the incident.
According to documents
reviewed by The Michigan Daily,
Gibbons was permanently sepa-
rated from the University in
December following a violation
of the Student Sexual Miscon-

duct Policy.
A second complaint is also
being investigated along with
Smith's - the content of which
has notbeen made public.
OCR investigators are holding
office hours until Thursday, and
held two focus groups for male
and female students Wednesday
afternoon.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, said the Uni-
versity has cooperated with the
OCR inquiry, and is interested in
hearing and responding to any of
the investigation's findings.
"They're going to help us,"
Harper said. "They're going to
say look, we've come to cam-
pus, we've heard from students,
here's some ideas and thoughts
about what you might do differ-
ently. And we will welcome that."
However, she added that she
believes real change at the Uni-
versity, especially in relation to
systemic issues like sexual mis-
conduct, can't only come from
an external source - it also has
to be driven by the students and

Four Democratic
city council members
have entered race
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily News Editor
With less than a week to go
before classes end, Ann Arbor
Mayor John Hieftje's stu-
dents tackled an unusual proj-
ect - hosting a forum for the
Ann Arbor mayoral candidates

Wednesday afternoon.
Hieftje's Public Policy class
hosted, organized and moderat-
ed the forum held in the Gerald
R. Ford School of Public Policy's
Annenberg Auditorium. The
event was open to the public;
attendees were encouraged to
submit questions for the candi-
dates who used the opportunity
to introduce themselves and
their platforms to the voters.
Councilmembers Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), Stephen Kunselman
(D-Ward 3), Sally Hart Petersen

(D-Ward 2) and Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) are currently
the only candidates declared in
the race, meaning the Demo-
cratic primary in August will
likely decide the race.
The policy students' ques-
tions were varied, giving the
candidates a chance to discuss
their opinions on an array of
concerns for the city such as
downtown development, shel-
ter services, public transit and
"town-gown" relations. Each of
the four worked to distinguish

themselves in their answers,
often returning to the same
themes for each question.
Petersen framed most of her
answers within a business and
economic context - her stron-
gest area of experience. She said
the city's revenue problem is one
of her main concerns, hoping to
work from several perspectives
to bolster economic growth.
Briere focused on increas-
ing inclusivity and accessibility
of the city officials, wanting to

Historically,
doctors were given
political power due
to their profession
By TOM McBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
Politicians usually come from a
few typical professions: law, busi-
ness and community service, to
name a few. But a large, educated
class of people in our society - doc-
tors - rarely become politicians.
In his lecture "The Doctor Who
Would Be King: Medical Utopias
in the Colonial World," Dr. Guil-
laume Lachenal discussed cases in
which doctors were given control
of certain regions of colonial Africa
in the 20th century. Lachenal, a
medical historian visiting from the
Universit4 Paris Diderot, discussed
the origins and impacts of these
colonies.
For the 20th-century colonial
project, one of the most costly dan-
gers was African trypanosomiasis
- a fatal disease caused by a para-
site transmitted by the tsetse fly,
also known as sleeping sickness.
This, Lachenal said, along with
accusations by other European
nations of unsanitary conditions,

led the French to begin a massive
health campaign in Cameroon in
1925.
Despite early successes of this
campaign, doctors still had one
major complaint: they could not
completely eradicate the disease
due to the reticence of politicians,
who were unwilling to enforce
radical measures such as stopping
forced labor and slowing trade.
Due to continued outcries, Dr. Jean
David was appointed Doctor-Cap-
tain ofthe Medical Region of Haut-
Nyongin French Cameroon in1939.
Lachenal said David's original
changes had beneficial effects on
the local population's health. Intro-
ducing cocoa, cattle, soybeans and
novel treatment and screening
techniques reduced mortality due
to disease sharply. Statistical analy-
ses of these benefits were published
worldwide and the experiment was
painted as a success.
ButLachenal'sresearchsuggests
that, despite the health benefits,
the Medical Region may not have
been quite the utopia the French
claimed.
"Therestrictionoftheir freedom
to be inefficient and wasteful of
natural resources has given to the
people of Anchau, freedom from
much of their former ill health -
which is surely to their benefit,"

Bar completes
renovation after
winter pipe burst
By CHRISTY SONG
Daily StaffReporter
The Blue Leprechaun has
returned.
After suffering extensive
damage from a pipe burst

in December, the sports bar
reopened to patrons Monday.
The burst occurred in a fire
suppression line during early
hours of the morning, after the
restaurant closed for the day.
Mike Gradillas, general man-
ager of the Blue Leprechaun,
said when he went to open up
the restaurant later that day, he
found an unfortunate surprise.
"We came in in the morning
and water was cascading down

every wall and coming through
the roof," Gradillas said. "So,
everything was completely
inundated with water."
Gradillas said he tried to
make sure the bar was open in
time for University seniors to
get their last drink in before
graduation. He added that
the staff was eager return to
work. The Blue Leprechaun
was finally cleared by the city

Alum lives a life of crime (writing)

Steve Hamilton graduated from
the University in 1983 with a B.S.
in computer science. He was a
recipient of the Hopwood Award
for undergraduate writing and has
since written 11 crime fiction nov-
els in his Alex McKnightseries. He
currently works at IBM.
What did you do after you
graduated?
I went to work for IBM in New
York State. I gave a commence-
ment address at Lake Superior
State a couple of years ago and
the theme I had was, while you're
wearing the funny gown, you
have to make that promise to
yourself that you'll do what you

really want to do in life even if you
have to start somewhere else. And
it did take a while. Because once
you're working full time, there is
nobody making you do what you
really want to do. Nobody was
making oe write. It was all up
to me and it took a while to get
back to it. Itwas joining a writer's
group that sort of got me back.
How did you find out about the
writing group?
It was somebody that I worked
with. He was part of this group
that was a half dozen people that
met in the basement of a library
across the river, and they were
writing all sorts of stuff: fiction,

historical fiction, all kinds of stuff.
Eventually I got back to what I
really loved reading and wanted
to write, which was crime fiction.
Do you have any advice to
offer current students?
Things are tough now in the
state of Michigan. And it was
tough back in the early '80s and
I did have to leave the state of
Michigan. And that was the
practical choice. But that's OK.
Because when you do leave, you
sort of find out what was so spe-
cial about the state of Michigan
and Ann Arbor. You'll always be a
Wolverine.

en route to vacation
MOKPO, South Korea (AP)
- Strong currents, rain and bad
visibility hampered rescuers
Thursday in the search for 287
passengers still missing more
than 24 hours after their ferry
flipped onto its side and filled
with water off the southern coast
of South Korea.
Nine people, including three
students and two teachers, were
confirmed dead, but many expect
a sharp jump in that number
because the missing have now
spent more than a day either
trapped in the ferry or in the cold
seawater. There was also fury

among families waiting for word
of passengers who were mostly
high school students.
There were 475 people aboard,
and some of the frantic parents of
the 325 student passengers who'd
been heading to Jeju island for a
four-day trip gathered at Danwon
High School in Ansan, which is
near Seoul, and in Mokpo, in the
south of the country, not far from
where the ferry slipped beneath
the surface until only the blue-
tipped, forward edge of the keel
was visible.
Relatives of the three dead stu-
dents wailed and sobbed as ambu-
lances at a hospital in Mokpo took
the bodies to Ansan. The fami-
lies, who spent a mostly sleepless
night at the hospital, followed the
ambulances in their own cars.
The family of one of the vic-
tims, 24-year-old teacher Choi
Hye-jung, spoke about a young

woman who loved to boast of how
her students would come to her
office and give her hugs.
"She was very active and want-
ed to be a good leader," her father,
Choi Jae-kyu, 53, said at Mokpo
Jung-Ang Hospital while waiting
for the arrival of his daughter's
body. Choi's mother, sitting on a
bench at the hospital, sobbed qui-
etly with her head bent down on
her knee.
Meanwhile, more than 400
rescuers searched nearby waters
overnight and into Thursday
morning. Coast guard spokes-
man Kim Jae-in said that in the
next two days, three vessels with
cranes onboard would arrive to
help with the rescue and salvage
the ship. Divers worked round the
clock in shifts in an attempt to get
inside the vessel, he said. But the
current wouldn't allow them to
enter.

Schauer releases
plan to raise

Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Mark Schauer said
Wednesday he would make edu-

Schauer and his running

Their proposal includes a school
adequacy study, expanded teach-
er training, increased financial

dards for class sizes and teacher-
student ratios.
"Due to cuts that Gov. Snyder
has made, my youngest son is
not receiving the same quality of
education that his oldest brother
received in the same schools,"
Brown said, citing fewer school
programs and increased extra-
curricular costs.

She also discussed her vision
of Ann Arbor's downtown as
a more social center, drawing
tourism and shopping.
Kunselman and Taylor had
less consistency of theme with
their responses, having more
distinct visions for different
projects. Kunselman often
returned to his hope to reduce
the city's focus on downtown
development and work more
closely with neighborhoods.
Kunselman did stress his exten-
sive campaign experience and
thorough knowledge of city
code.
Taylor also emphasized the
importance of community out-
reach. He and Briere both spoke
in favor of expanding public
transportation infrastructure
to the county, with only Taylor
explicitly giving his support for
the May 6 millage to expand the
Ann Arbor Transit Authority
bus lines.
The candidates also
addressed the city's engage-
ment with students. Taylor and
Petersen left more of the bur-
den on the city to reach out to
students while Briere and Kun-
selman said it was the responsi-
bility of students to be proactive
in getting involved.

primaries will take place over

there are far fewer students on

about that."

the same day as the rest of the
country in November.
Hieftje said it was a two-
way street of responsibility for
involving young voters, falling
both on the accessibility of the
elected officials and the dedica-
tion of the students.
"The city does make a lot of
efforts to reach out to student
voters," he said. "I make avail-
able the boards and commis-
sions that I make appointments
to - we have students serv-
ing on the taxi cab board, we
have students serving on other
boards. One of the problem for
students who may not be here
year-round is the city functions
year-round."
In an interview after the
event, Petersen said she has
had discussions with Business
senior Michael Proppe, outgo-
ing Central Student Govern-
ment president, as well as other
students, about encouraging
students to register for absen-
tee ballots.
"My network really is from
local high school graduates
who are at U of M right now
and convincing them to get out
the vote," she said.
Still, issues of low partici-
pation are compounded by
the high volume of students
returning home for the sum-
mer, along with the fact that
many are registered to vote in
their hometowns rather than
in Ann Arbor. Moreover, can-
didates will likely turn their

Dahbour added that though
the organization is not current-

are continuing their activism
throughout the summer.
"Right now our focus is in
bringing about awareness," she
said. "Divestment is still a very
big priority for us and it's not
something that we've forgotten
about."
To be on the agenda of the
regents meeting, the proposal
would have to indicate wide-
spread community concern.
The regents would set upa com-
mittee to investigate Univer-
sity investments if the proposal

wanted to share his experiences.

University Provost Martha
Pollack said any consideration
of divestment would be the
regents' decision, but empha-
sized that such resolutions
require extensive delibera-
tion.
"The bar for divestment is
intentionally set very high," she
said.
E. Royster Harper, vice pres-
ident for student life, echoed
Pollack's views on the slim
chance that a divestment reso-
lution would pass if brought
before the regents.
"The board will decide
whether or not it's going to
divest, and right now, it's made
a decision that it's not," she said.
Harper added that students
are still encouraged to speak
out and challenge the Univer-
sity if they feel strongly about

passionate about, anything
they believe in, they ought to be

thing different," Harper said.
However, Harper said she
encourages students to seek
other options to approach the
conflict in the Middle East. She
said divestment is just one way
to potentially achieve this end,
and students should consider
various views.
"The real issue is what we're
not talking about. We are actu-
ally spending all of our time on
a tool," she said. "So we end up
at an impasse when there are
lots more tools."
Harper said the University's
students are the leaders of the
future who have the power to
work collaboratively and solve
the world's most pressing chal-
lenges.
"I know that they're in our

body is safe and protected,"
Harper said. "That's what I'm
waiting on."

the bar opened its doors that
same night.
Gradillas said he was pleas-
antly surprised at how many
people came out to support the
reopening and responses have
been overwhelmingly positive.
Though there are no major
physical changes to the build-
ing, Gradillas said the restau-
rant looks brighter and sharper
with new paint and wallpaper.
Gradillas added that the res-
taurant has the same feel as it
did before undergoing renova-
tion.
During their temporary
closure, the Blue Leprechaun
has added several items to
their menu, including a new
selection of sliders. Others

additions include wraps and
different typesof sauces, and
the bar will continue to serve
its traditional sandwich and
burger options.
Gradillas said he wanted to
provide the same food as before,
but wanted to make them dis-
tinguishable from typical bar
foods.
LSA senior Jeremy Kucera
said he likes the renovations and
thinks the updated menu will
attract more customers.
"They kept the same charac-
ter and it's just updated, so it's a
lot nicer," Kucera said. "I think
the new menu is going to attract
a lot more people before nine o
'clock when the happy hour is so
I think it's a great idea."

Damian Chatman agreed that
the renovations will boost busi-
ness.

renovations," Chatman said.


AFRICA

reads a quote from The Lancet
about a similar colony controlled
by the British.
Lachenal said despite the fact
that the measures taken improved
health, this seemed to imply some
sort of unwillingness from the
local population.
In addition, the health success
of the colony was short-lived. Rub-
ber shortages during World War
II combined with labor shortages
convinced David to reestablish
forced labor. This meant that
locals were entering the forests
for daysbefore comingbackto the
village and exposing themselves
to others in the marketplace: a
perfect combination for a sleeping
sickness epidemic.
Quickly after this turn of
events, statistics from the colony
stopped being collected and pub-
lished. The entire area became
disease-ridden, and David died
shortly after the war.
Lachenal said the legacy of
the colony is mixed. On one
hand, it improved the people's
health for a certain amount of
time. On the other hand, many of
the doctors were left broken and
despondent.

"For once, they could not
blame their failures on the
administration and the bureau-
cracy and the politicians, because
they were the politicians," Lache-
nal said.
It is also rumored that David
and one of his main lieutenants,
Dr. Henri Koch, had gone mad by
the end of their terms, though the
record is unclear.
"This story can be taken as a
parable if you want," Lachenal
said. "Today's global health is also
a story of hope, full of success sto-
ries and charismatic doctors. But
we also risk doctor's losing their
critical voices when they touch on
power and glory."
Medical student Maia Ander-
son said she appreciated the lec-
ture.
"I've always liked learning
about the history of medicine and
I think that it isn't taught enough
in medicalschool or in undergrad,
evenand Ithinkit's awesome that
there's a big push for that here,"
she said.
"I think that there are a lot of
stories like this that are buried and
yeah we do go and travel around
and we think it's a great idea to go
places and teach people to have
.better hygiene. But what we saw is
that doctors aren't fit to govern all
the time. Good intentions are not
always enough."

Keeping it clean
Michigan should invest more money into clean energy research
ntario Power Generation, a government-owned electric company,
recently proposed the development of a nuclear waste facility less
than a mile from Lake Huron. Citizens have raised concerns about
the proposal since some of the waste materials were found to be "hundreds of
times more radioactive" than originally reported to the Canadian government.
Radiation in Lake Huron could harm Michigan lake-based industries such
as tourism and taint the source of drinking water relied upon by millions of
Americans. Though some forms of clean electrical generation such as nuclear
energy are more beneficial to the environment than coal-fired plants, the
negative effects must be addressed first. Michigan should continue to work
closely with the Canadian government and regulatory agencies to prevent the
development of the proposed facility and formulate viable alternatives for the

Dreams from my sister

This is my last week in
Washington, D.C. but my
mind is in only one place:
Beaumont, Royal
Oak's psychiatric
ward, where
my sister, Caity,
has been since
Friday. She
hospitalized
herself that
night for fear JAMES
of her own BRENNAN
safety, having
experienced
suicidal thoughts as a result of
her continuing battles against her
own mind.
Some of you may have become
familiar with my sister this year on
campus. You may have read one of
her columns in The Michigan Daily,
been served by her while out at The
Brown Jug or recognized her as the
outspoken 23-year-old sophomore
in class. what you probably
wouldn't have realized, though, is
that since she was a small child, my
sister has been fighting a myriad
of mental health challenges, from
depression to anxiety to bipolar
disorder. You also probably didn't
know of her struggles this semester,
on and off various antipsychotic
drugs in an attempt to control
increasingly perplexing problems
and side effects.
Mental health issues have long
been in the closet, but they no longer
can be. My sister's story is one of
millions that needs to be heard.
I need to make it clear that
Caity is not just any other person.
I'm obviously biased because I'm
her brother, but it's true. This is
a girl who had set her heart on
Columbia University in elementary
school because "Harvard is too
conservative" and who began on the
honors track in middle school. She
had mastered the German language

by 16, was a state championship
contender in mock trial at 17, and
then moved to Europe, alone,
at 19. By age 20, she was able to
communicate in French, Flemish,
Swedish and Spanish with little
formal training, all while working
as a fashion design assistant and a
nanny full time.
But, like many others, my sister's
brilliant mind is at war with itself
every single day, often crippling her
abilities to go to school, work or,
some days, hold a coherent thought.
In my short lifetime, I've seen
far more suffering from mental
health issues than any single person
should. In middle school, I saw
my sister mourn the loss of one of
her best friends, who committed
suicide at 15. Two years later, I was
calling an ambulance after my sister
swallowed three bottles of pills
in an attempt to end her own life.
Shortly after that, one of my older
cousins killed himself while only in
his20s. I've had my share of mental
health issues as well, fighting
suicidal thoughts and spending
countless hours in therapy.
If I've learned anything from
my experience with mental health
problems, it's that it needs to stop
being treated so differently from
every other ailment. A person
suffering from bipolar disorder
is like a person suffering from
cancer or diabetes. This isn't a
matter of choice or control; their
brain chemistry is malfunctioning
and needs treatment to function
properly again. Their body is
physically not working, much like a
sick patient with a failing immune
system. The only difference is that
their symptoms come out in their
thinking and behavior. People are
rarely "crazy" - more often than
not, they're actually very sick.
Like with other health-care
issues, the people who are worst

off in this area are the poor and
the middle class. Since my father's
untimely death in 2011, my family
has been scraping by. My mom's
job provides health care, but there
are numerous gaps, especially for
mental health. I get sick to my
stomach in fear of my sister losing
coverage or running outof money for
medication. She has the potential to
do truly amazing things, impressing
me and countless others everyday
with her intelligence, her charm
and her writing. Without help, she
loses the chance to make the most of
these gifts. I try not to think about
it, but am constantly reminded
of the hundreds of thousands of
homeless and poor without any of
the help Caity and I get.
This is a problem that cannot be
solved by talking. This needs to be
treated like the public-health crisis
it is, and we need to put our money
where our mouths are. Federal,
state and local governments need
to invest more in insurance and
facilities for mental health, while
schools need to provide counselors
and educate students on psychiatric
health like any other public-health
problem. This needs support from
our tax dollars, our charitable giving
and our treatment of individuals
with psychiatric problems.
The mentally ill are not just
patients in hospitals. They're the
untapped potential in our schools
and the silently suffering masses
in homeless shelters. They're the
depressed suburban mom and the
schizophrenic old woman struggling
to maintain sanity. They're our
friends, our neighbors and our
family, and they're very, very sick.
They need help and we have the
means to give it to them.
What are we waiting for?

disposal of nuclear waste.
Clean energies harness essentially abundant
resources- such asthe sunorwind - to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and improve the
quality of the environment. Nuclear energy is
a unique form of energy generation because
it's almost entirely free of greenhouse gas
emissions and thus can ameliorate air quality
concerns. Additionally, clean energy industries
have the potential to stimulate job growth and
the economy. As of 2010, the state of Michigan
had more than 70,000 "clean"jobs. In Michigan
alone, the nuclear facilities support more
than 2,900 employees and buy more than $117
million worth of materials, supporting related
Michigan companies.
Yet, there are several negative consequences
from these clean energy options. Though
nuclear powertis efficient, nuclearwaste
disposal, like the process that would happen
in the proposed site, is hazardous due to its
radioactivity. These drawbacks,however, aren't
limited to nuclear energy. Wind turbines have
shown to reduce bat populations by more than
600,000 in a given year because of the pressure
changes associated with the blades. Similarly,
solar panel waste is toxic and can pollute water
supplies when improperly disposed of.
Though these problems are detrimental,
there are relatively straightforward solutions

to mitigate the effects. Proposed solutions for
the bat population problem caused by wind
turbines include the incorporation of radar
or ultrasonic acoustics, painting turbines
different colors or taking animal territory
into consideration when placing the turbines.
However, there is still not enough knowledge
to fix all of the drawbacks of clean energy
since the integration of these technologies is
relatively recent. Two years ago, researchers at
Michigan State University studied a bacteria,
Geobacter, which could clean up nuclear waste.
However, the bacteria is not yet able to be used
for large-scale cleanup. For many clean energy
sources, it is still unclear how to preserve the
environmental benefits while reducing the
negative effects associated with them.
Clean energy has the potential to be an
environmentally and financially sound
solution despite its drawbacks. More money
shouldbeinvestedintoresearchingmethodsto
reduce and even eliminate the negative effects
of clean energy. There should also be more
regulation to further ensure the prevention
of environmental mishaps. Initiatives focused
on the environment can reduce the stigma
of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's failing
environmental grade and make Michigan a
frontrunner in environmental policy.

TAYLOR CROOKSTON I
Giving life to the debate

As an institution, the University constantly
calls for totalinclusivity, diversity and tolerance.
Unfortunately, it fails to ensure such principles
in a number of contexts. One glaring example
can be seen within the conversation around
abortion. As a leader of Students for Life, I
have firsthand experience with the suffocating
chokehold the University has placed on pro-life
viewpoints across campus. I believe that the
way in which the University blatantly supports
abortion has extremely detrimental effects
acrosscampus.The onlywaythisUniversitycan
meet its full potential and live up to itspromises
is to allow its students to think for themselves
in an environment where inclusivity, diversity
and tolerance are genuinely celebrated and
not smothered.
Currently in Lane Hall, the University -
more specifically, the Department of Women's
Studies and the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender - is hosting a pro-abortion
exhibit titled "4,000 Years for Choice" that has
offended and ostracized many pro-life students.
There are some students that are appalled that
the University would use taxpayer dollars
to fund such a one-sided display on such a
contentious issue. Others are horrified by the
exhibit's claim that "abortion is a gift from
God." However, I have come to expect such
things from my University. From hearing it
link pro-life ideology and terrorism together
to discovering that it offers practicum courses
with volunteer time at Planned Parenthood, at
this point, it is hard for the University to shock
me with its sponsored partisanship.
Still, this latest stunt is exceptional for avari-
ety of reasons. "4000 Years for Choice" is not an
event; it is a constant stream of propaganda. It is
on display in Lane Hall for an extensive amount
of time, through the end of this semester and
throughout all of May. Each student who enters
Lane Hall during this time will immediately
be bombarded with messages that we should
"applaud" abortion activists and "praise" the
illegal abortionists of the past. The exhibit even
contains directly political overtones by its call
to "celebrate Roe v. Wade." In addition, it prop-
agates insanely paradoxical statements that
abortion is "life-affirming," "a gift from God"
and that "religious freedom = abortion access."
This exhibit belongs at Pro-Choice America
fundraisers and National Abortion Federation
conferences (where, unsurprisingly, its creator
has had displays in just the past year alone), but
it does not belong in Lane Hall. If it were to be
on campus, students who support it should have

brought it - not paid for with taxpayer dollars
and officially promoted by the University.
The fact is that the University-does not have
the right - and it certainly does not have the
ability - to create a consensus on campus that
abortion is an accepted and moral practice.
In fact, on a national scale, the exact opposite
consensus is gaining traction. Gallup reported
in 2012 that pro-choice Americans were
at record-low numbers and that a majority
of Americans now self-identify as pro-life.
However, Gallup further reported that the
majority of Americans hold the perception that
the majority opinion in the United States is pro-
choice. This misjudgment is directly related to
institutionalized partisanship that can be seen
in University-sponsored exhibits like that of
"4000 Years for Choice."
Looking past this exhibit and into my own
experience at the University, what really
saddens, discourages and frustrates me is that
the disdain the University shows for pro-life
values converts a space thatwas designed for the
flourishing ofintellectual discussion and debate
into an environment of exclusion, stagnancy
and intolerance.
I am tired - as are the thousands of other
pro-life students at the University - of being
force-fed ideology.
Teach us how to think, not what to think.
Let us discuss and debate as students and
faculty in community together, and allow
genuine conversation to take place without
presupposing the conclusion.
I am tired of my fellow students being too
scared to speak up as pro-life in the classroom,
in the Diag and in our social circles.
I am tired of being at parties and having peer
after peer "confessing" to me in a whisper that
they share my pro-life convictions. Students
should not have to draw off some liquid courage
before being able to speak about how they truly
feel about abortion.
Yet the University ensures that pro-life
students know that they and their beliefs are
unwelcome here and I am tired of it. It's time
for the University to stop sponsoring events
like "4,000 Years for Choice" that create a false
sense of pro-choice unanimity on campus. The
University owes it to us, its students and its own
incredible legacy as a place of higher learning to
stop dictating debate and'thereby allow mean-
ingful intellectual discovery and growth to
take place.

The first thing that I noticed were
her shoes. Not because of their color
or their style, but because of what
they were doing. As we walked down
4th Ave towards East Liberty, me
about 25 feet behind this stranger,
I watched curiously as her feet
wandered across the sidewalk. Ittwas
clear there was some kind of pattern.
She would start near the center of
the pavement and then slowly drift
outwards towards the curb. After a
few paces with her shoes hugging
the edge of the pavement, she would
gradually shift back towards center
again. Her movement was not jerky,
like a child's when trying to hop
over cracks in the sidewalk. It was
smooth and natural, creating some
sort of wave.
But what was most unusual about
her path was not what it looked like,
but why she was doing it. This way of
walking is somethingI often do when
I see some kind of obstacle in the
distance: a dead animal in the road, a
pothole, a drink someone spilled. But
whenever it came time for me to walk
across a square of sidewalk that she
had just crossed, I didn't see anything
worth avoiding. Maybe she's just an
aimless walker, I thought, or maybe
she's confused about where she is
going. But as I looked up from the
most recent slice of sidewalk I had
been examining to assess where her
shoes were this time, I saw him.
About 60 feet ahead of us a mid-
dle-aged Black man sat to our left on
a bus bench. As we both neared him,
I several paces behind this woman,
I looked on in bewilderment as her
path began to shift right ever so
slightly. The process was so gradual,
I doubt that she noticed it herself.
But I did. In every step she took for-
ward, she shifted a little bit further
away from him, creating a buffer
zone between herself and this man.
As we passed him and continued
down the street, she slowly started
moving back inwards until her shoes
were once again in line the center of
the sidewalk. I tried to make sense of
what I had observed as I witnessed
her repeat the same swerving pattern
with each of the three subsequent
black people we passed as we walked
along the bus station. Although my
gut was telling me her behavior was
motivated by race (or more accurate-
ly, racism), I did what we millenials
are often trained to do and strained

to find and any remote justification
that I could as to why it was not about
race (see: "It's about hip-hop, not
race" a la Theta Xi, and "It's a cele-
brationoftheirculture" saidbyevery
person ever who has worn a "Native-
American" Halloween costume).
I considered that she didn't like
to be near people at all when walk-
ing down the street, regardless of
race. Maybe she was having a private
phone conversation that she didn't
want overheard. She could have
thought that the people waiting for
the bus wanted more space and was
trying to be polite by moving over.
But as I settled on the idea that I had
simply jumped to conclusions and
misjudged her, I witnessed some-
thing that gave me pause. At the cor-
ner of 4th Ave and East Liberty, there
was a white man washing the win-
dows above the Kuroshio Japanese
restaurant. Standing in the middle of
the sidewalk with a sponge attached
to a long metal pole, he was dripping
water down the black awning of the
restaurant and all over passersby. If
there was anyone to avoid, this man
seemed like the one, for no reason
other than he was actually busy doing
something that was messy for anyone
within a few feet of him. When she
approached him, however, she didn't
change her course at all, causing him
to have to stop what he was doing to
move out of her way.
As I turned left down East
Liberty and she continued straight
on 4th, I realized that this is exactly
the kind of subtle, hostile behavior
that I, and people who look like
me, face every day. This girl never
outright said "I would prefer not to
walk near Black people if I can avoid
it because something about them is
distasteful to me," but she didn't
need to: her shoes spelled it out on
the sidewalk. And honestly, I don't
even think she knew what they
were writing. This type of hard-to-
name, often subconscious glimpse
of racial prejudice accounts for the
majority of racism I experience
on campus. Unfortunately, I think
this kind is the hardest to fight,
because even though I know I
am experiencing racism, others
often just see oversensitivity or
hyper-awareness.
When I try to pinpoint for them
exactly what clues me in to the event
being about my race as opposed to

being about my demeanor, my gender,
my verbal intonation, my outfit, or
anything else about me, Iam often at
a loss of words. Trying to do a deep
dive into every social interaction
to carve out and categorize the
nuances of someone's behavior isn't
something Ican or am willing to do.
In the same way thatI, as a straight
person, know that if someone doesn't
like me it has absolutely nothing to
do with who I love, when someone
white on this campus feels left out,
ignored, misrepresented, or unheard
it will never have been because of
their race. And because it is never
about race for you, it makes it that
much more difficult for you to
identify and understand when it is
about race for me.
Sometimes you'll just have to
trust that even though I can't really
describe what every instance of
racism will look like, I always know
it when I see it. I see it in the flash
of surprise that crosses someone's
face when I tell them I am a
chemical engineer, as they try to
reconcile how someone can be both
Black and pursuing STEM. I see it
in the empty bus seats next to Black
people, when people are standing
despite the fact that there is clearly
a seat available. I saw it in this white
woman's shoes, as she layered an
invisible barrier in between herself
and black strangers but didn't do
the same with a white one.
Because the thing is, these days
you don't have to call me a nigger,
wear a white-hooded cape, or burn
a cross on my front lawn to let me
know that who I am, the way that
I am, isn't always welcome here.
From your perspective, you might
just be walking forward carrying
on with your life, but from mine
a few paces back, I can see you
silently inching to the right. My
experience walking behind you
all these years has forced me to be
aware of things that you physically
don't have the perspective to see.
But just because you can't or won't
see them doesn't mean they're not
happening. Maybe one day I'll catch
up to you. Walking side-by-side,
there will be no gap for either of us
to witness. But until then, the first
thing I'll notice is your shoes.

The Michigan Daily's 2014 Finals Study Guide

Bring the fun back
to college campuses

I

By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
WeekendRoundup Editor
Dear Reader,
As you may or may not know,
the Weekend Roundup is a news
section of The Daily created this
semester to inform the campus
community of all of the amaz-
ing events that take place here
at the University each weekend,
as well as provide entertaining
columns and fun features for
students to consume when they
aren't looking for something su-
per serious. Whether or not it
metthatgoalistobedetermined,
but hopefully, this section will
only continue to expand and
improve in the future (and sug-
gestions are always welcome).
I've been an advocate for
this section because I believe it
fills an important hole not only
in the Daily, but on campus as
well: Students need fun. And
while I'll be the first to tout
the importance of hard news,
expert sources and in-depth
reporting, sometimes students
just need a break from that.
Tuesday, Slate published
a thought-provoking piece, at
least for all of us high-achieving
University students, entitled
"The Sad Demise of Collegiate

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized scholarly honorary society in America. Founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary, it celebrates
excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The UM chapter, Alpha of Michigan, was founded in 1907 and inducted its hundred and sixth class into membership on
April 13, 2014. An invitation to join Phi Beta Kappa requires a history of impecable academic performance that reflects not only grades but breadth and depth of
intellectual engagement. Membership as a junior requires an almost perfect record. The Executive Committee of the Alpha of Michigan Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
recognizes and congratulates the new members of this venerable society.

The Michigan Daily's 2014 Finals Study Guide

My final finals:
A testament to
procrastination

CAPS to provide
mental health
break during finals

ByK.C.WASSMAN
Daily Weekend Contributor
Hi. My name is K.C. Wassman
and I am a procrastinator. I have
watched Netflix, played QuizUp
and even cleaned the bathroom
instead of doing school work.
Students across campus and the
country share my addiction, but
some feel the need to hide it.
You have all seen the signs
of a closet procrastinator. They
quickly close their Facebook
tab, subtly play games on their
phones and say they're reading
news articles for "research" - be
honest, you're probably reading
this article as an escape from a fi-
nal you should be studying for.
Procrastination is not some-
thing to be ashamed of. Embrac-
ing procrastination as an innate .
part of your work method can
be frustrating, but also very re-
warding. I freely admit that I
procrastinate on a regular basis
and I say it with a sense of pride.
Throughout my years in aca-
demia, I have learned to do large
amounts of work in very short
time periods. I know exactly when
I need to start writing a paper in
order to turn it in on time - the
night before. While this isn't a
hard and fast rule, it's the gen-
eral principle behind my argu-
ably successful academic pursuits.
I have spent countless late
nights and early mornings writ-
ing papers, finishing projects
and studying for exams. As ex-
pected, there were a few panic
attacks, but those grew fewer
and further between as I moved
from freshman to senior year.
From nights in Markley to
nights in the Union, I learned to
relish my procrastination. Now
I enjoy finding that perfect spot
on campus to turn into a make-
shift living room while I study
and watch -"30 Rock" simulta-

neously, and get a small jolt of
energy after returning from ev-
ery five-minute Tumblr break.
Some truly great moments
happen while procrastinating.
Once, I convinced my room-
mate to spend six hours watch-
ing "Breaking Amish" with me
on Netflix. It's neither one of our
proudest accomplishments, but
we'll always remember it as a fun
time we spent together in the
months leading up to graduation.
Apart from giving me irre-
placeable - cue Beyonca song
- memories, my penchant for
procrastination led me to a job I
loved. Freshman year, Ijoined The
Michigan Daily to test my ability
to work under a deadline. What is
procrastination if not thriving un-
der pressure? Four years and sev-
eral breaking-news stories later,
I am leaving the Daily poised to
enter the media industry full time.
Procrastinating isn't for every-
body, butwe all shouldtryitatleast
once. Pulling an all-nighterto write
a paper worth 15 percent of your
grade and receiving an A on it is one
of the best feelings in the world.
As I approach my final finals, I
know exactly what I have to do to
succeed: procrastinate. We all do
it, so we may as well embrace it.
Don't feel bad for getting a good
night's rest this week instead of
snoozing in weird positions on the
UGLi tables. Recognize the time
you need to work in order to suc-
ceed, and spend every other mo-
ment doing something you enjoy.
When the library is getting to
be too much for youthese nexttwo
weeks, get up and go outside. Find
a friend to split a fishbowl or frolic
in the Arb with, and if no one else
understands your need to procras-
tinate, give me a call. My final
finals week will include a lot of
studying,butmoreimportantly, it
will include Dominick's, Netflix
and life outside of study rooms.

Finals week can be one
of the most stressful and
frustrating times on campus,
especially when summer
break is just over the hori-
zon. Luckily, many campus
organizations offer plenty of
places for quiet studying and
opportunities for fun study
breaks.
Study at the Trotter
Multicultural Center
Looking for a quiet place
to study? The Trotter Multi-
cultural Center will be open
24/7 beginning Thursday
and ending Sunday. Stu-
dents can enjoy free cof-
fee and snacks as well as
take movie breaks or watch
open-mic performances.
After the Trotter Center
closes, Hillel will begin its
24/7 Study Hours for finals
week beginning Sunday and
ending next Friday. Hil-
lel will also provide free
snacks, massages and yoga
classes.

Take advantage of free
events
The Center for Campus
Involvement is also busy
providing students with fun
study break opportunities
in the remaining few days
of class as part of its Stress
Relief Week campaign. Stu-
dents can rock climb at the
Intramural Sports Building
on Friday, get a free massage
and participate ina "Pinterset
DIY craft" event on Tuesday
in the Union. The organiza-
tion is also sponsoring "snack
attacks" Friday and Monday
in surprise locations.
Laugh your worries away
Laugh off some of your
finals stress Tuesday evening
at The BIG SHOWin the Men-
delssohn Theatre presented
by ComCo, the University's
oldest improve group. The
BIG SHOW is one of ComCo's
oldest traditions and promises
a funny night to help you for-
get all the work you have to do
in the upcoming week. Tick-
ets are $2 in advance and $3 at
the door.

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Weekend Contributor
As the winter semester winds
down, finals are just a week away,
making this time of year particu-
larly stressful. But it's not just
limited to final examinations.
Todd Sevig, the director of
Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services at the University,
said for some students, the end
of the semester can mean a lot
more than filling out a bluebook.
"In addition to the stress
of exams, projects, papers
and lab reports, for some stu-
dents the transition into sum-
mer can also be stressful," Sevig
said. "Whether it's graduating,
an internship or going home
and spending summer there."
Maintaining a healthy mental-
ity is extremely important when
working toward success. Sevig
said it's a practice that students
should engage in year-round, but
especially during finals. CAPS,
which is a network of profession-
als and students promoting men-
tal wellness within the University
community, provides these neces-
sary tools throughout the school
year to ease overwhelming stress.
"If there's one thing I'm try-
ing to promote through everything
we do, it is the science of when
we take care of ourselves," Sevig
said. "When we build in stress and
anxiety management on a regular
basis we perform better. We have
better relationships and we do
better on tests, including finals:'
The CAPS Stressbusters app,
released earlier this semester, is
one of the many resources avail-
able to students. The app includes
fun daily messages written by
University students, faculty, par-
ents and even alum. In addition
to inspirational tips, the app in-
cludes soothing audio tracks that
aim to increase concentration.
Though using the app the
night before an exam won't help
performance, Sevig encour-
ages students to use the app
on a consistent basis in the up-.
coming week before exams.
"Little things do make a dif-
ference," Sevig said. "It's the cul-
mination, it's the practice, it's
the almost every day of doing
something like that - that ac-
tually does make a difference.'

Aside from the mobile app,
Sevig said social connectedness
also helps the mind. The Well-
ness Zone, which opened in 2011
and attracts roughly 4,000 stu-
dents every year, is located on
the third floor of the Union and
provides a stress-free and enter-
taining environment for students.
The Zone includes massag-
ing chairs, yoga and meditation,
light therapy for seasonal affec-
tive disorder and an Xbox with
Kinect. The Kinect system gets
user's blood pumping through
motion-controlled gaming. Sevig
said stress relief doesn't always
include quiet meditation: Hav-
ing fun-is also an integral part of
maintaining a positive mentality.
The Wellness Zone is open dur-
ing CAPS hours of business: Mon-
day through Thursday from 8:30
a.m.to7p.m.andFridaysuntil5p.m.
CAPS' website also has links to
two-minute videos that are meant
to help manage depression. The
videos offer tips on sleeping pat-
terns, the relationship between
diet and exercise and other ways of
treating depression. There is also
a 24-minute instructional video
on progressive muscle relaxation
available on YouTube that guides
the listener through a series of sub-
tle movements against the sound
of ocean waves in the background.
As students begin to feel the
weight of exams, Sevig advises
students to hold onto the mean-
ing of what they're doing, be-
cause it'll allow studying to come
much more easily. He said the no-
tion of doing your best is a mat-
ter of being consistent and keep-
ing your eye on the big picture.
"It's the idea that doing your
best means not just the outcome
or the output of a grade"' Sevig
said. "Doing your best when' we
take care of ourselves means con-
necting with the passion of why
you're doing this in the firstplace."
Sevig said mental health is
both a science and an art. Mul-
tiple studies have shown that a 10
to 15 minute break for every hour
of work improves efficiency. The
art is what becomes of that break
- some use it for meditation
while others take a jog or dance.
"The art is figuring out what
works for you," Sevig said. "Stress
and anxiety management is a
highly individualized thing."

Wolverines have been familiar
with.
Collectively, the senior
class has won two Big Ten
Championships, picked up one
regular-season conference title
and qualified for three NCAA
Championships.
They have impressed

Natalie Beilstein is a two-time

won, almost as if those are the
only ones who can win," said
Michigan coach Bev Plocki,
"We need to go in there with
that chip on our shoulder once
again and prove everyone
wrong just like we did at the Big
Ten Championships."
Only five teams have ever
won a national championship.
At the Donald R. Shepherd
Training Center, 21 conference
banners hang from the ceiling.
There is space reserved in the
very center - a perfect spot for a
national championship banner.
"Would we like to hang one?"
Plocki said. "Absolutely."

shortstop raised his arms, the
umpire made a fist, signalingthat
the left fielder had in fact made
the diving catch. The pitcher
pumped his fist, the fans got up,
and the ballgame was over.
For the seventh straight
time, Michigan baseball fans
left the crosstown matchup
disappointed. The left fielder's
snag ended the game after two
runners on gave the Wolverines
(6-6 Big Ten, 16-20-1 overall)
yet another opportunity to
break through in the game.
Despite 11 hits at the plate and
12 strikeouts on the mound,
Michigan failed to execute
and keep pace with the Eagles,
falling 4-3 int10 innings.
"There was just a lot of non-
execution today - we didn't
play well at all," said Michigan
coach Erik Bakich. "We walked
five leadoff hitters, three of them
scored, we had a lot of missed
bunts, and across the board, we
didn't play to win. That's the
bottom line."
Despite a combined 18 hits,
both teams struggled to push
runs across throughout the
game. The first real action
occurred when an Eastern
Michigan triple scored the
contest's first run. Two pitches
later, a double drove in a second
run and ended senior right-
hander Ben Ballantine's night.
Once the team ace, Ballantine
has pitched just 8.2 total innings
in his last three starts while
posting a 10.81 ERA.
Filling in for Ballantine was
right-hander Cam Wysocki. The
freshman quickly settled things
down for the Wolverines in the
fourth, opening the door for
junior infielder Kyle Jusick to
blast his first career home run to

bottom half of the inning, two

Johnny Slater made things
interesting, but Slater's poke into

Dropping their second
straight midweek game, the
Wolverines failed to retain
momentum from a successful
weekend series against Illinois.
With a trip to cellar-dwelling
Purdue this weekend, Bakich is
looking for more consistency.
"We've got four Big Ten
weekends left, and for us
it's going to come down to
consistency," Bakich said. "If
we're going to have any shot at
postseason play, we need to be
a whole lot more consistent. We
need to be trendingupwards and
continue that into each game.
We can't have setbacks like this.

Wolverines take down Titans for third win

It was another day of firsts for
the Michigan women's lacrosse

the right direction.

"It was really great to be in

said Michigan coach Jennifer
Ulehla. "I was really proud of
the way we played today."
Despite the final score, it was
not all smooth sailing for the
Wolverines. The Titans took
an early 2-0 lead and had a 5-4

Michigan to victory. Goalie
Allison Silber made eight saves
on 14 shots on goal for the
Wolverines to achieve a save
percentage of 57.1 percent.
"Allison is the anchor of our
defense," Ulehla said. "Even
though she didn't see a lot of
shots, she made several good
saves and did a great job of
keeping her concentration."
Though Wednesday marked
a milestone achievement for
the fledgling program, there
was little time to celebrate. The
Wolverines are slated to take on
a tough opponent in Vanderbilt


on Saturday in their ALC finale.
Nevertheless, Ulehla is looking
forward to the matchup, having
already played against five top-
20 opponents this year.
"It has been great to see the
growth we've had this season
after the tough schedule we've
played," Ulehla said. "We've
really been learning what it
takes to compete at the Division
I level and Vanderbilt will be a
good test to see just how much
we have matured."
