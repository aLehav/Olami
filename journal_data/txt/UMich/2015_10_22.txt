Forum draws 

law enforcement 
leadership from 
across the county

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Following an ongoing national 

conversation about the relationship 
between police and communities, 
Washtenaw County Police and 
Public Safety department will now 
implement additional measures to 
communicate with the public. 

On Wednesday, the 16th Annual 

Public Forum for the Enhancement 
of Police and Community Trust 
featured a panel of police from 
municipalities 
including 
Ann 

Arbor, 
Ypsilanti, 
Milan 
and 

Pittsfield Township, in addition 
to the Michigan State Police. 
Community members came from 
all over the county with questions 
about police relations.

Stephanie 
Dawkins 
Davis, 

executive assistant U.S. attorney, 
spoke 
about 
the 
importance 

of 
ensuring 
regular 
police 

correspondence 
with 
the 

community. Davis said community 
understanding of law enforcement 
has 
had 
positive 
results 
in 

southeast Michigan.

“Justice doesn’t happen under 

a rock, the community has to 
understand what decisions are 
being made and what criteria is 
needed to make those decisions,” 
Davis said.

She added that Detroit has a 

similar program to ENPACT called 
ALPACT — Advocates and Leaders 
for Police and Community Trust. 
According to Davis, the program 
has been extremely successful. 
She cited a recent incident when 
an Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement agent shot a man in 
Detroit, pointing out that there 
were no riots from the city’s 
inhabitants in response.

“We 
were 
able 
to 
have 

respectful dialogue,” Davis said.

Ford School panel 
focuses on impact 
of the city’s 2014 
‘grand bargain’

Daily Staff Reporter

Key 
players 
in 
Detroit’s 

now-infamous 
bankruptcy 

proceedings convened at the 
Ford School of Public Policy on 

Wednesday to discuss the city’s 
growth since the city first filed 
for bankruptcy in 2013.

The panel focused on the 

impact of the Detroit “grand 
bargain,” 
which 
decreased 

the city’s $18 billion debt, 
restored public safety services 
and increased funding to city 
infrastructure.

U.S. 
Bankruptcy 
Judge 

Steven W. Rhodes, who oversaw 
Detroit’s bankruptcy, designed 
the 
$194.8 
million 
bailout, 

known as the grand bargain, to 

garner support for a deal from 
unions and retirees. Rhodes 
joined Wednesday’s panel along 
with Judge Gerald Rosen, Judge 
Mike Gadola, former State Sen. 
Randy 
Richardville, 
former 

State Rep. Thomas Stallworth 
and Chad Livengood, a political 
reporter for The Detroit News.

The panelists examined how 

Detroit’s financial challenges 
halted the city’s full operation 
— from its road, school and 
emergency 
services 
to 
the 

pension plans and benefits for 

city retirees — and credited the 
grand bargain with its revival.

“From 
a 
constitutional 

perspective, this is the state of 
Michigan coming to the federal 
government to solve a problem 
that it could not solve on its 
own under our constitutional 
structure,” Rhodes said.

Rhodes said when the city 

filed for bankruptcy, the largest 
portion of debt came from the 
water department’s secured debt 
and post-employment benefits

Technology could 
increase success of 
surgeries to remove 

brain tumors

By TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Brain tumor removal is the 

ultimate 
game 
of 
Operation. 

Remove too little of a tumor and 
it could be back within months. 
Remove too much and your patient 
may never speak or walk again.

A new microscope, developed 

in the University’s Medical School, 
could help surgeons with the 
difficult task of tumor removal by 
showing the difference between 
healthy and tumorous tissue in 
real-time.

A team of Medical School 

doctors and students spent years 
developing the new technology, 
called 
the 
stimulated 
Raman 

scattering — or SRS — microscope, 
alongside researchers from other 
institutions 
including 
Harvard 

and New York University. It could 
eventually 
help 
improve 
the 

outcomes for some of the nearly 
700,000 people in the United 

States living with brain tumors.

Third-year 
Medical 
student 

Spencer Lewis, an author of the 
paper announcing the first clinical 
test of this technology, said it’s 
difficult to tell the difference 
between healthy and unhealthy 
brain tissue using the naked eye 
— making the technology all the 
more neccisary. 

“Brain tissue normally looks like 

a soft, tan mass with a very soft, 
jelly-like consistency,” Lewis said. 
“And tumor is often a similar color 
and is really only differentiated by 
texture. So it’s very difficult to tell 
by eye the difference, depending 
on the type of tumor.”

The SRS microscope addresses 

this difficulty through a technique 
called 
Raman 
spectroscopy, 

which uses a laser to shine light 
at a piece of brain tissue that has 
been biopsied from the brain. The 
many molecules in the tissue have 
chemical bonds between them that 
are constantly wiggling, stretching 
and rotating. Each type of tiny 
bond movement affects the light in 
a different way. By detecting how 
the light is altered and scattered, 
scientists can infer what kind of 
bonds and molecules are in the 
tissue. The SRS amplifies this

Barnes Arico touts 

senior forward’s 
progress coming 
off major injuries

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

For any athlete, two years 

of injuries can incur just as 
much damage mentally as it can 

physically. But for a senior on the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team, a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament and a broken foot have 
revamped her mindset, leaving 
her looking to finish on a high.

Wednesday, at the Michigan 

women’s basketball team’s media 
day, coach Kim Barnes Arico 
began her opening statement by 
mentioning a player that hasn’t 
been in many headlines: forward 
Kelsey Mitchell.

After highlighting the new 

additions to her staff and 
recapping 
the 
Wolverines’ 

WNIT

last 
spring, 

Barnes Arico discussed the 
small number of scholarship 
upperclassmen on the team 
(four), led by Mitchell and senior 
guard Madison Ristovski.

“Out 
of 
those 
four 

(upperclassmen), I think the 
biggest surprise right now is

New programs 

encourage historic 
number of patents

By TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s Medical 

School produced the most 
inventions and startups in 
its history over the last fiscal 
year, the school announced 
last Monday.

Due largely to new programs 

designed to help researchers 
introduce their discoveries to 
the market, the Medical School 
broke its previous records in 
almost all tech transfer metrics 
including patents filed, startups 
produced, license agreements 
with industry and revenues. 
Especially lucrative was the 
partial sale of the University-

licensing rights, which earned 
the University $65.6 million.

effect, allowing doctors to see 
specific structural details.

Lewis, working under Daniel 

Orringer, assistant professor of 
neurological surgery, said the 
development team currently uses 
the SRS microscope to detect 
proteins and lipids, two major 
structural components of cells and 
tissues. While tumor tissues look 
similar to normal tissues to the 
naked eye, they organize proteins 
and lipids very differently at the 
cellular level, allowing for easier 
distinction between the two.

“That allows us to see the 

architecture of the brain in vivid 
detail that’s just not possible 
with 
traditional 
microscopy 

techniques,” Lewis said.

This 
gives 
doctors 
a 

potentially 
faster 
and 
more 

accurate 
distinguishing 
tool 

than the method that’s currently 
used, called the frozen-section 
method. By allowing doctors 
to 
shorten 
surgeries 
and 

confidently remove more of 
a tumor, Lewis said chances 
for relapse as well as for 
complications of surgery could 
be lessened.

Lewis said the typically used 

frozen-section technique has a 
couple of drawbacks.

“The problem is that it takes 

a while — 30 to 45 minutes,” he 
said. “And also it introduces a 
lot of artifacts like ice crystals 
that can mess with the accuracy 
of the pathologist’s read. SRS is 
done without labels and without 
damaging the tissue. It’s done 

on fresh tissue. You take it out, 
mount it on a slide and image it 
right there.”

While the SRS currently 

takes about the same amount of 
time as a frozen-section, Lewis 
said optimizing the technology 
could get imaging times down 
to one second.

The microscope could also 

help to improve the stereotactic 
brain surgery technique, which 
combines 
3D 
models 
of 
the 

brain taken before surgery with 
probes attached to the surgeons’ 
instruments 
to 
show 
doctors 

exactly where their tools are 
during an operation.

“The problem with this is that 

because the brain is soft and the 
brain can swell, it can shift during 
surgery,” Lewis said. “So, during 
the course of an operation, you 
can’t always tell where you are 
relative to the preoperative MRI as 
you are dissecting the tumor. And 
that leads to inaccuracy.”

By identifying brain tissues 

in real time, Lewis said the SRS 
microscope could prevent these 
inaccuracies.

The SRS microscope, which 

is the first commercial version 
in the world, has been used on 
more than 60 patient brain tissue 
samples since June. Until the 
team finishes development and 
procures FDA approval, however, 
no surgeons will use it to make 
clinical decisions.

Lewis 
said 
that 
future 

improvements to the microscope 
and 
imaging 
methods, 
such 

as adapting the SRS to detect 
molecules that build up specifically 
in 
cancer 
cells, 
could 
have 

enormous impacts on surgery.

“Essentially, 
you 
could 

highlight tumor cells specifically, 
which would be a tremendous 
advance,” he said.

Next, the research team hopes 

to develop a probe-like model 
of the microscope that could 
examine tissues while they are 
still in the brain.

‘U’ in D.C. program 
celebrates 10th year

Students take classes 

and intern while 
on Michigan in 

Washington program

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan in Washington 

program, 
through 
which 

University students temporarily 
trade life in Ann Arbor to work 
in the nation’s capital, will turn 
a decade old this week. Since 
2005, the program has given 45 
to 50 students per semester the 
opportunity to spend either the 
fall or winter in Washington, 
D.C.

“The MIW program was 

created to provide students 
with an opportunity to live, 
work and study in Washington, 
D.C.,” said Edie Goldenberg, a 
professor of public policy and 
political science who was the 
founding director of the MIW 
program. “The major idea is 
for undergraduates from any 
major at UM to use what they 
learn 
in 
their 
internships 

and what they learn in class 
to complement each other in 
meaningful ways.”

On Friday, the program will 

hold a banquet at the National 
Press Club in D.C. featuring 
pre-recorded 
speeches 
from 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, Michigan Gov. Rick 
Snyder, as well as a live stream 
speech from LSA Dean Andrew 
Martin. Rep. David Trott (D–
Birmingham) will keynote the 
celebration.

The 
program 
experience 

begins before students leave 
campus since they are required 
to take a preparatory course the 
semester before leaving for the 
capital. Once in Washington, 

participating 
students 
are 

paired with a University alumni 
mentor and are required to 
find an internship and write 
a research paper, in addition 
to taking classes — a feat 
Goldenberg says isn’t easy.

“ 
MIW 
is 
academically 

rigorous,” 
Goldenberg 
said. 

“Every student completes 12-15 
UM credits, nine of which are 
required and the others elective. 
The courses are designed to 
take advantage of being in D.C. 
rather than merely to duplicate 
what’s available on campus. 
”

Though more than half of the 

2013-2014 class was comprised 
of political science majors, the 
program accepts students from 
all fields of study, and students 
arrange to get credit for their 
major through their internship 
and research paper.

Students are also encouraged 

to find an internship that best 
suits their interests. Members 
of last year’s class interned 
at 
organizations 
such 
as 

congressional offices, the U.S. 
Department of State, the Sierra 
Club, NBC’s “Meet the Press,” 
the Mexican Embassy and the 
John F. Kennedy Center for the 
Performing Arts.

After 
10 
years 
of 
the 

program, the alumni base has 
amassed 460 individuals in all 
lines of work around the world. 
For many, their experience in 
Washington has opened up 
doors to future career options.

“All of our alums are notable,” 

Goldenberg said. “MIW alums 
have won writing prizes for 
their research papers. Two have 
been chosen as commencement 
speakers. Roughly 40 have 
graduated and been employed 
in 
the 
Washington, 
D.C. 

area. Many others have been 
admitted to graduate schools 
of their choice. Several have 
published their work and others 

have started charitable efforts.”

Students currently studying 

in D.C. already feeling the 
benefits of the program. LSA 
senior Whitney Swart, who is 
interning at an organization 
that provides legal and social 
services to immigrants, said 
the opportunity has given her 
a better handle on her future 
goals.

“In 
the 
Michigan 
in 

Washington Program, I have 
had the opportunity to make 
important connections, pursue 
my passions and fall in love 
with a new city,” Swart said. “It 
wasn’t until I lived and worked 
in D.C. that I truly understood 
my goals and found myself.”

LSA junior Evan Viau, an 

intern for the Truman National 
Security Project, said his time 
in D.C. has helped him find his 
calling.

“My 
time 
in 
MIW 
has 

been instrumental in refining 
my 
post-graduate 
career 

goals 
and 
allowing 
me 
to 

grow both intellectually and 
professionally,” he said. “I have 
had substantive opportunities 
to work with experts in my issue 
areas to research, develop, and 
advocate for national security 
policies that address the new 
challenges of the 21st century; 
an 
opportunity 
I 
probably 

wouldn’t have had if I didn’t 
spend a semester in the District 
through this program.”

Viau said the work isn’t easy, 

either.

“It’s certainly a challenging 

environment— 
being 

surrounded by some of the 
best and brightest around the 
country— but it’s comforting 
to see the impact of my hard 
work daily,” he said. “I applied 
to the program to find purpose 
and support, and I’ve definitely 
found it.”

— like health care for retirees — 
which totaled $5 billion.

Detroit’s two pension plans 

accumulated $3.5 billion in 
debt obligations Rhodes said. 
Bond debt was another factor, 
estimated between $500 million 
and $1 billion when the city filed 
for bankruptcy.

“I 
assumed 
one 
way 
or 

another the debt would get 
worked out in the bankruptcy 
process,” Rhodes said. “What 
really concerned me was the 
anger of the people of the city.”

Many 
Detroiters 
were 

angry their city’s bankruptcy 
proceedings were being handled 
by an unelected emergency 
manager, 
University 
alum 

Kevyn 
Orr, 
whom 
Rhodes 

said the people believed had 
unlawfully 
displaced 
their 

elected government.

“They were protesting about 

that,” Rhodes said, “There were 
demonstrations in the streets.”

Bargain and bankruptcy

Rosen, who served as the 

chief 
judicial 
mediator 
for 

Detroit’s bankruptcy case, said 
in addition to the city’s financial 
obligations, there were human 
costs to Detroit’s debt.

“Detroit was what municipal 

bankruptcy experts refer to as 
service, delivery and solve,” 
Rosen said. “That means for the 
city’s residents, businesses and 
visitors, the city really isn’t a 
city at all.”

Rosen said prior to the filing, 

the city was not effectively 
providing basic public safety 
services like police, firefighters 
and 
emergency 
medical 

services.

“Response time for police was 

running close to an hour against 
the national average of 11 minute 
response times,” Rosen said.

Rosen said 12,000 fires a 

year went unanswered, and 40 
percent of the city’s roughly 
90,000 streetlights were out in 
Detroit, leaving large portions 

of the city in the dark.

“And of course, criminals 

thrive 
in 
the 
darkened 

streets,” Rosen said.

Rosen said in 2013, the city 

had less than eight weeks of 
operating cash when it filed 
for bankruptcy. He said time 
was running out for Detroit, 
and the bargain could not 
wait.

Stallworth, 
who 

represented 
Michigan’s 

seventh legislative district 
during the creation of the 
grand bargain, said it was 
heavily debated when it was 
introduced, and attributed 
its success to the strong 
leadership in the Senate 
and House interested in 
putting partisanship aside. 
As part of the deal, the state 
of Michigan, private donors 
and 
foundations 
cobbled 

together $800 million to pay 
down the debt. The bargain 
also resulted in cuts to 
pensions for many retired 
city workers.

Pensions

Controversy 
surrounded 

Detroit’s 
eligibility 
for 

bankruptcy when the General 
Retirement 
System 
and 

the Detroit Police and Fire 
Retirement Committee argued 
that by filing for bankruptcy, 
Detroit violated its pension 
policies protected under the 
state’s constitution.

“The city wasn’t even making 

its contributions to the pensions, 
and the retirees who had given 
their working lives,” Rosen said.

Stallworth said he still gets 

targeted by citizens who say 
he’s responsible for losing their 
pensions, but he is at peace with 
his actions during his time. 
Approving the grand bargain 
required pensioners to approve 
reductions to the benefits they 
owed as a condition of forgiving 
some of the city’s debt.

“When 
we 
talk 
about 

outcomes, everyone wants to get 
well but nobody wants to take 
their medicine,” Stallworth said.

Stallworth said police and 

firefighters were not required 
to take pension cuts under the 
bargain.

The Detroit Institute of Arts

An aim of the bargain was to 

preserve the Detroit Institute of 
Arts, and rumors circulated that 
the museum would be forced to 
sell city-owned artwork.

“The art was the only readily 

monetized asset, as the only 
asset that I, as the mediator, had 
available to monetize,” Rosen 
said.

However, Rhodes disagreed 

that creditors had the potential 
to monetize the art outside of 
bankruptcy.

“Creditors would not have 

access to the art outside of 
the 
bankruptcy 
under 
any 

circumstance, 
and 
they 

admitted that,” Rhodes said.

Rosen said liquidating the 

DIA would be devastating to the 
region and the state, however 
Rhodes 
could 
not 
override 

Orr’s authority as emergency 

manager.

“It would suck the life out of 

Midtown and create a civil war,” 
Rosen said.

Detroit Public Schools

Gadola said the grand bargain 

cannot be replicated to address 
Detroit’s other issues without 
the leverage of an asset like the 
DIA.

“The DIA was the lynchpin 

of the grand bargain,” Gadola 
said.

The panelists discussed how 

the bankruptcy had negatively 
impacted Detroit Public Schools.

Livengood said bailing out 

DPS would require the state to 
spend $715 million over 10 years, 
doubling the amount of the 
grand bargain. DPS currently 
faces as $200 million deficit.

“Not only is DPS failing, so 

are the charters,” Stallworth 
said. “There’s no real question 
of who’s to blame.”

In confronting how the debt 

affected Detroit Public Schools, 

Rhodes said there was nothing 
worse than denying there was a 
problem.

“Denial is a river in Egypt,” 

he said. “Denial can play no 
part in the rational solution of 
insolvency.”

Rhodes said the city exceeded 

its constitutional debt rate, and 
raising taxes would not increase 
their revenues, but actually 
lower them because people 
would flee the city.

“Residents 
and 
businesses 

look at cost of living in a city 
compared to what services they 
get,” Rhodes said. “Detroit was 
in no position to compete, let 
alone if they raised taxes.”

Livengood said people had to 

come to terms with what was 
in front of them, facts ignored 
by the former Gov. Jennifer 
Granholm 
administration, 

Detroit 
residents 
and 
the 

media.

“It was a classic case of a city 

that had been mismanaged at 
several levels,” Livengood said.

that would never happen, but the 
key to preventing something like 
that from happening is having 
dialogue.”

Jim Baird, interim chief of the 

Ann Arbor Police Department, 
said fostering police-community 
relations is a priority throughout 
his time as interim chief.

“I would like to reaffirm our 

commitment to continuing the 
relationships that we’ve spoken to 
already,” he said.

Former AAPD Police Chief 

John Seto retired after 25 years 
with the AAPD. During the 
event, Baird said a new chief of 
police would be appointed by the 
end of the year.

Attorney Angie Martell raised 

the first question of the dialogue, 
asking about police confrontations 
with Hispanics and transgender 
individuals. 
Martell 
said 
she 

wants to start a conversation with 
police about diversity training.

Baird told the group the AAPD 

is working to target these issues.

“We have had a diversity 

training and awareness level, 
understanding 
that 
there’s 

different perspectives,” Baird said. 
“I think that we can take that both 
ways so we can get perceptions 
of community, especially specific 
groups, and understand where 
they’re coming from and how 
they may experience the contact 
of police. We can also educate the 
community why we do some of the 
things we do.”

The treatment of residents that 

may suffer from mental health 
issues, such as veterans or autistic 
individuals, was also addressed. 
Police 
leadership 
across 
the 

panel spoke to the issue, telling 

attendees they are working hard 
to give officers training related to 
mental health. Marlene Radzik, 
lieutenant with the Washtenaw 
County Sheriff’s Department, said 
the department is confronting 
these issues with extra training.

“We are moving towards crisis 

intervention 
training, 
which 

would help train the officers and 
allow us to be more capable of 
handling situations that involve 
mental illness,” Radzik said.

In 
November 
2014, 
Ann 

Arbor resident Aura Rosser was 
killed by an AAPD officer who 
was responding to a domestic 
violence call. Rosser reportedly 
suffered from mental illness. 
After the incident, many Ann 
Arbor residents called on the 
department to come up with 
better protocols for interacting 
with residents who may struggle 
with mental health issues.

Chuck Warpehoski, Ann 

Arbor City Council member 
(D–Ward 5), brought up the 
mitigation of police bias when 
performing arrests.

Local 
attorney 
Erane 

Washington 
agreed 
with 

Warpehoski 
that 
implicit 

biases present a significant 
issue in the community. She 
asked the panel to address 
implicit bias and cultural 
competency.

“When 
we 
talk 
about 

implicit biases, we’re talking 
about a whole gamut of issues,” 
Washington said. “I don’t 
really know what cultural 
competency really means, so 
my question for the panel is 
to explain in more detail on 
what is cultural competency 
training.” 

Robert 
Neumann, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Police Department chief, said 

implicit bias is an important 
issue for police everywhere.

“Every human being has 

implicit bias. No one is free of 
some kind of bias,” Neumann 
said. 
“Part 
of 
cultural 

competency training is helping 
everyone 
understand 
that 

they are a product of their 
experiences. First, recognizing 
that and recognizing that you’re 
not above making an unfair 
decision based on your implicit 
biases.”

Though the forum raised a 

lot of topics, Warpehoski said 

further discussion is needed 
before the relationship of police 
and community is where it 
should be.

“The challenge of a format 

like this is that there’s a little 
bit of conversation about a lot of 
issues with a lot of jurisdictions,” 
Warpehoski said. “We don’t get 
the chance to go in depth on any 
one of them.”

He said police officers and 

community members need to 
keep 
communications 
open 

year-round and not just annually 
at these forums.

“This 
conversation 
about 

fundamental levels of training 
is something that we have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
make 

right and to make better,” 
Warpehoski 
said. 
“Whether 

we’re 
dealing 
with 
mental 

illness, dealing with race and 
diversity issues, dealing with 
conflict resolution, we need 
to create a clear standard and 
policies. We need a system of 
ongoing training where we’re 
continuously 
working 
with 

our officers on these specific 
issues.”

career thus far, with a torn ACL 
and a broken foot and last season 
trying to regroup from those 
injuries, but in practice, she has 
been incredible. I know we are 
only 10 practices in, but we are 
hoping she can have a Cyesha 
Goree-type of breakout season.”

Goree, a senior last year, 

stepped into the spotlight by 
improving her average of 1.1 
points per game to 12.1 during her 
junior year. While Barnes Arico 

doesn’t anticipate those types 
of numbers right out of the gate 
from Mitchell, she expressed her 
excitement to finally witness the 
potential that has been tucked 
away for the past three years.

Mitchell, at 6 feet, is one of the 

shortest forwards on the team, 
but she is still expected to play in 
the paint and size up some of the 
bigger guards in the conference.

“Even though she’s only about 

6 foot, her power is equal to 
(freshman center) Hallie Thome’s 
height (6-foot-5),” said sophomore 
center Terra Stapleton. “She 
knows how to maneuver around 

people, and she definitely knows 
how to body somebody.”

Stapleton, 
whose 
locker 

neighbors Mitchell’s, said the 
senior is not the type of person 
“that’ll take no for an answer,” 
and that she’s been bursting 
with energy for the first handful 
of practices.

All of Mitchell’s teammates 

attested that her confidence 
jumped 
this 
year, 
and 
she 

couldn’t deny it either. On the 
tail end of her Michigan career, 
it is reassuring for Mitchell to 
know she is, at long last, healthy 
enough to contribute.

“I have to say I’ve improved 

most in my confidence in myself,” 
Mitchell said. “Just in my ability 
and knowing I’ll be physically OK 
to play at this high of a level.”

The kind of gritty, hard-nosed 

presence 
Mitchell 
provides 

is 
just 
what 
Barnes 
Arico 

is looking for, as this year’s 
biggest concern is replacing the 
graduated seniors — a stalwart 
trio that made up 59 percent of 
the team’s total rebounding.

Filling such a large void will 

take the entire team, but Barnes 
Arico believes Mitchell could 
put a chunk of that weight on 

her shoulders.

“I’m hoping that Kelsey can 

stay healthy enough, because 
she really has been a spark in 
practice,” Barnes Arico said. “She 
is showing things that I haven’t 
seen in four years.

“She hasn’t experienced the 

grind of doing it on a regular 
basis, and that’s making me a 
little nervous about her because 
of the wear and tear on her body, 
but if she can hold off and be even 
half of what (Goree) was able to 
contribute (two years ago), it 
could be a special year.”

commercialization 
represents 

the school’s understanding that 
research should be directly applied 
to society whenever possible.

“Over a period of time, it’s really 

become understood that part of 
our mission is not only to pursue 
knowledge for knowledge’s sake or 
understanding’s sake, but to use it 
and apply it to improve the human 
condition,” he said.

The 
University’s 
Office 
of 

Tech 
Transfer 
is 
responsible 

for 
commercializing 
research 

discoveries from all three University 
campuses. A recent press release 
announced a bevy of tech transfer 
improvements since last year. The 
Medical School produced 166 new 
invention reports compared to 133 
from the previous year, 51 patent 
applications compared to 45, 10 
new startups as opposed to one and 
$74.8 million in total revenue.

Ken 
Nisbet, 
the 
Office 
of 

Technology Transfer’s associate 
vice president for research, said 
the new Fast Forward Medical 
Innovation program helped drive 
the commercialization increases.

“The results are a function of 

several things,” Nisbet said. “I 
would say that FFMI, in particular, 
is a real influencer in the number of 
ideas that reach us.”

A team of Medical School 

administrators 
and 
doctors 

started the FFMI program in 
2014 to encourage researchers to 
commercialize 
their 
inventions. 

The program provides awareness 
programs, 
funding, 
idea 

consultations and business seminars 
to expand awareness about the 
opportunities in commercialization.

The Office of Tech Transfer’s 

responsibilities 
are 
broader. 

It 
focuses 
on 
the 
entire 

commercialization 
process 
— 

including licensing agreements and 
intellectual property protection — 
and works with departments from 
all University campuses. The two 
organizations have partnered on 
many projects, however, including 
the 
Michigan 
Translational 

Research and Commercialization 
for Life Sciences Program, or 
MTRAC, which awards extra 
funding 
and 
consultation 
to 

especially promising projects. 

Nisbet said the University’s 

excellence in research is a factor 
in its commercial success.

“Our researchers here — our 

faculty — win competitive grants 
to answer questions from the 
proposals 
that 
these 
federal 

agencies have, which is why we 
have $1.3 billion of total spending,” 
Nisbet said. “We have a number of 
very high-quality faculty that win 
these grants so we answer some 
basic science questions. So, that is 
sort of the root of everything here: 
our research operation.”

Wooliscroft said the University’s 

excellence in a broad variety of 
disciplines is another reason for 
the recent success.

“One of the things that we 

have here that is a phenomenal 
advantage over the vast majority of 
universities is that we have a top-
ranked engineering college, top-
ranked medical school, business 
school, etc.,” he said. “So there’s 
great expertise across campus 
the likes of which only one or two 
other universities can duplicate.”

Nisbet said he believes these 

levels of success will continue 
because researchers will come 
back to the Office of Tech Transfer 
after successful experiences.

“I think it’s a gradual build,” 

he said. “FFMI was definitely 
a major component, but there 
were a whole lot of other factors 
that led to it. And that’s good 
news because it means that this 
momentum will continue.”

Woolliscroft 
said 
a 
new 

generation of wearable health-
monitoring devices, which could 
be developed through the Office of 
Tech Transfer’s IT health program, 
could revolutionize future medical 
practices.

Despite this positive momentum, 

Nisbet and Woolliscroft said there 
are many hurdles to overcome. 
Both 
mentioned 
the 
sheer 

difficulty of guiding a product from 
conception to profitability. Nisbet 
said the threat of declining federal 
funding means the University will 
have to fight to increase the share of 
grants it receives, and Woolliscroft 
said regulatory issues often slow 
the progress.

“Too frequently, our regulatory 

processes and agencies have not 
kept up with the progress in science 
and technology,” Woolliscroft said. 
“There’s a big push through the 21st 
Century Cures bill to modernize 
the FDA and these processes, but 
we’ll have to see with our political 
process if that goes forward or not.”

A

s I stroll down State Street, I’m finding 
it difficult to enjoy my favorite season. 
The yellow leaves blowing across the 

road (despite the lack of 
nearby trees) or the autumn 
breeze as it picks up my hair 
(and throws it across my 
face) are not holding their 
usual charm. Honestly, they 
overwhelm me. 

More and more often I 

have been struggling with 
the recognition that time 
is passing. Already, I’m in 
my second year of college. 
Already, the leaves are rashly 
diving to the ground; the 
wind is prematurely becom-
ing crisp. Everything happens just a bit too soon 
for my liking. Already, it’s nearly November, and 
already, I have to rent my first house.

“It’s just what everyone does,” I defensively 

tell my mother after asking her for house-
searching advice. She responds, “Why?”

She cannot believe I’m this old either. My 

answer isn’t good enough for her. 

“Well,” I continue, “I’m not going to apply 

to be an RA, because I don’t think they would 
hire my personality, not because I couldn’t do 
the job, but because the personality, you know, 
my personality?” I ramble. “And my friends 
are starting to look and I don’t want to get left 
behind, not that I need to do what everyone else 
is doing, except that I do in order to pay rent 
and live and attend school. Mom. 

“I love school,” I say, breathing heavily. 
I may seem too nervous to someone who 

thinks I just started thinking about looking for 
a house that day. But what my mother did not 
know was that I had been thinking about it for 
weeks already, maybe even months. (Early and 
abundant nerves are some of my charms.)

The first time I started to actively search 

instead of worry was near the end of Septem-
ber. A few friends of mine were going to look at 
what one of them thought was a relatively inex-
pensive apartment complex; I hedged her into 
asking the group if I could tag along. 

The following week we went for our sched-

uled tour, but as soon as I entered the lobby I 
knew something didn’t feel right. That is a 
nice painting above the front desk, I thought to 
myself. There is a gym. And it’s big. Throughout 
the tour I tuned out what our guide was saying, 
so much so that I repetitively tried to open a 
door the wrong way. 

“It’s push,” our guide said. So the staff 

is helpful, too, I criticized. Why could I not 
describe what was wrong with this place? 

It was after the elevator ride up to the deck 

on at least the 10th floor that I realized what 
it was. When the now annoyingly attentive 
tour guide finally gave us a second, I pulled my 
friends together to share my epiphany: “This 
place is too good for us.” 

That was the truest sentence I have ever said. 
“I don’t know about you, but I am the aver-

age the college student. I am moderately quite 
poor, or I am quite moderately poor — either 
one. (Again, with the rambling.) But the thing 
is, while I am poor, I need to live like I am poor. 
I need to look like I am poor; I need to feel the 
poorness that I am.” 

There was a pause after the declaration that 

made it seem more revolutionary than it actu-
ally was, but my friends both looked relieved 
when finally they agreed. I rode down the 
elevator feeling somewhat victorious (one can 
only feel so victorious in an elevator).

We were also back to the beginning. This time, 

we would properly search without dignity.

The following week, I attended a housing fair 

at the Union, searching, though still not entirely 
sure what I was searching for. “This one has four 
bedrooms,” I informed my friends after accept-
ing the listings from various property manage-
ment companies. “This one costs this much,” 
pointing to what, without really knowing, is just 
a fairly arbitrary number. If I could be any less 
helpful, I’m sure I would be. “This one is blue.”

After collecting many different flyers of rental 

options, we rifled through them, highlighters 
in hand, to narrow the search. But looking back 
now, even the highlighting was arbitrary. I could 
not reason why one house deserved fluorescence 
and the other did not. Four bedrooms, I was told 
to look for. I know now that it depends on the 
size of the bedroom and who is willing to share. 
Oh, that is a good price, I was told; but now, post-
calculations, I have realized I can indeed pay that 
amount per month, if I never eat again. 

Navigating how to find your first house isn’t 

a simple task, and I should remember that the 
people I’m searching with are as clueless as I am. 
By this I mean that they’re also just practicing 
“how to adult” and so they don’t know what they 
need, let alone what I need. If I have to discuss 
my price range with my parents, how do I expect 
them to know what I can and cannot afford?

My advice, then, in embarking on this new 

quest for shelter comes in three points: 

1. Remember to put yourself first. Your 

friends might not know what you can and can-
not afford, and I’m sure they will like you bet-

FROM THE DAILY

D

iversity — the loaded 
term 
that 
describes 

variety 
in 
personal 

backgrounds, 
opinions 
and 

experiences, 
among 
seem-

ingly 
countless 

other 
things. 

To acquire this 
bloated 
jargon 

is the mission 
of almost every 
reputable work-
place and uni-
versity.

What consti-

tutes diversity anyway? In work-
places and academic institutions 
such as the University of Michigan, 
quantifying and qualifying diversi-
ty is salient to intentional inclusion 
efforts. There’s a fine line between 
tokenizing 
identities 
to 
score 

points in the diversity index and 
purposeful recruiting and build-
ing support systems for a variety of 
backgrounds, ultimately deepening 
the intellectual and social develop-
ment for students and faculty.

In a study conducted by Deloitte 

and the Billie Jean King Leadership 
Initiative, millennials were more 
concerned with being surrounded 
by people who hold different cog-
nitive viewpoints based upon their 
upbringing, rather than focusing on 
demographic features like gender, 
sexual orientation or race. These 
differing viewpoints are rooted in 
people’s 
demographic 
identities 

and cannot be monolithic in defin-
ing diversity. In order to experience 
the full value of varying viewpoints 
and perspectives, the University 
must invest more resources to 
recruit and retain a diverse student, 
staff and faculty population.

#BBUM — a hashtag that stands 

for Being Black at the University 
of Michigan — sparked, last year, a 
University-wide dialogue about the 
deficiency in demographic diversity 
in the student body, and the scant 
institutional support for students 
of various backgrounds. #BBUM, 
which continued the legacy of the 
Black Action Movement and other 
activist movements on campus, was 
this generation’s uprising to chal-
lenge the University to reform its 
approaches to diversity, specifically 
in terms of recruitment and and 
retention. In response to the cam-
paign, the University has adopted 
several approaches to refine their 
diversity strategies.

In December 2013, Provost Mar-

tha Pollack established the Com-
mittee on Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion to address the concerns 
of University students — particu-
larly pertaining to the decline of 
minority students and accounts 
of an unwelcoming campus cli-
mate for students of color. One of 
the committee’s recommendations 
was to write a diversity report for 
each academic department. These 
reports should include data on staff 
hiring processes, plans to launch 
sustainable student recruiting ini-

tiatives, identify areas of improve-
ment and make recommendations 
that create a supportive workplace 
climate for all. The committee is 
liable for holding each department 
accountable for their work around 
diversity while also providing them 
with tools and resources to pro-
mote diversity. Though broadening 
the diversity of the student body 
is a key priority of this initiative, 
efforts to increase the diversity 
among University faculty are just as 
critical to ensuring a well-rounded 
campus climate. 

In 2005, the Journal of Blacks 

in Higher Education reported that 
Blacks make up 5.4 percent of all 
tenured faculty. Throughout my 
four years at the University, I have 
not been taught by a Black profes-
sor. I have taken classes in a variety 
of disciplines, and the closest I’ve 
gotten to having a Black professor 
was an education class my sopho-
more year, in which the class was 
co-instructed by a Black female.

This is the first year — my senior 

year — that I’ve had a Black GSI. I 
have yet to see a Black professor at the 
Ford School of Public Policy. Not one. 
To their credit, the dean of the Pub-
lic Policy School is a Black woman. 
While it delights my soul that the face 
of the Public Policy School School is 
a Black woman, most students don’t 
get frequent face time with her. She’s 
amenable to meeting with students 
through 
organized 
lunches 
and 

forums, but it’s a different experi-
ence to have continuous interaction 
between faculty and students.

As little as I have encountered 

Black 
female 
professors, 
I’ve 

encountered even fewer Black men 
in academia. I’ve grown so accus-
tomed to the lack of Black and 
brown faces from my previous edu-
cational experiences that I failed to 
see it as an issue.

Since I didn’t have professors 

that looked like me, I sought to find 
resources in Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs, the Office of Academic 
Multicultural 
Initiatives 
and 

other institutional mechanisms 
that were designed to embody safe 
spaces for people of color. I discov-
ered a sense of belonging and found 
personal connections, solace and 
guidance from people who could 
relate to my experiences through 
these venues, which is what I des-
perately sought all along. I then 
realized the consequences of being 
unable to develop meaningful and 
sustainable relationships with fac-
ulty in times I felt my identity was 
threatened. Having a diverse body 
of faculty is critical for student 
engagement and development.

Both nonwhite students and 

white students gain from learning 
from teachers of color. An article 
in The Atlantic about the benefits 
of increasing the number of teach-
ers of color for students of color 
and white students pointed out, 
“Studies show that, academically, 
nonwhite teachers produce more 
favorable outcomes for students of 
similar backgrounds; emotionally 

and socially, these educators serve 
as role models who share students’ 
racial and ethnic identity.”

Students are often more comfort-

able around faces that reflect their 
own identity, as it empowers their 
achievement, and creates a safe 
space. Professors of color are likely 
to identify with and provide strate-
gies for students on how to navigate 
spaces where they were “the only,” 
and affirm to them that being “the 
only” does not mean they are alone.

“What hasn’t gotten much atten-

tion, however, are the potential 
gains for white students.” Teachers 
of color are often able to introduce 
materials outside of the Eurocen-
tric curricula that primarily focus-
es on white American characters 
and narratives. This assists in dis-
rupting the one-sided portrayals of 
the world. 

Diversity is about more than just 

race. Though I have been content 
with the number of female pro-
fessors and the amount of ethnic 
diversity among my professors, I’ve 
had little interaction with profes-
sors who are disabled, homosexual, 
transgender, from a low or middle 
socioeconomic status or non-Chris-
tian. As a student in the Public Pol-
icy School and at an institution that 
prides itself on a community of the 
“Leaders and Best,” it’s a disservice 
and injustice to neglect the missing 
voices in our dialogue.

The issue we discuss in and out-

side of the classroom and the way 
we approach problems we seek to 
solve as future leaders have inher-
ent biases that impact diverse com-
munities. Without learning from 
people — either educators or stu-
dents — with characteristics differ-
ent from our own, we’re missing out 
on a fundamental part of our intel-
lectual and personal development. 
We cannot see or understand what 
we have not been exposed to.

I’m hopeful for the future efforts 

in increasing diversity. Many admin-
istrators and some students are 
proud of the proactive steps the 
University has taken to ensure rapid 
implementation of diversity efforts. 
Educational leaders, especially those 
of color, have a significant role as 
coaches and trainers, enlightening 
generations about their own history 
and identity and how it impacts their 
approaches to a given subject matter. 
Furthermore, educational leaders 
serve as mentors, role models and 
personal life coaches who can help 
direct students onto the stepping 
stones of success.

The University needs to increase 

its diversity in the student body, 
faculty and staff populations. We’re 
anticipating 
what 
changes 
can 

occur. The University’s reputation 
as a diverse institutional communi-
ty for future generations rests on our 
shoulders, so we all must be keenly 
aware and and sensitive to the ways 
in which we approach facilitating a 
diverse academic community.

Thickening the melting pot

I just want a home

D

uring last week’s Senate Assembly Committee on University 
Affairs meeting, Engineering Prof. James Holloway, the vice 
provost for global and engaged education, announced the 

University’s plan to release student course evaluation data via a newly 
developed, restricted-access website. The announcement dismayed 
some committee members, who don’t believe the evaluations in 
their current form provide valuable information and see no merit in 
publishing them for student use. While there’s no discernible harm 
in releasing the data as is, the administration must emphasize that 
course evaluations were created as a method of improving professor 
performance rather than a tool for scheduling classes.

Release course evaluation data

‘U’ should improve survey and build better scheduling system

The decision to release the course evaluation 

data came after prompting from the Central, 
LSA and Rackham student governments. 
While the information is currently available 
through Freedom of Information Act requests, 
it is difficult and time-consuming to access. 
Holloway and his colleagues are offering 
to expedite the process with a University-
sponsored 
website 
that 
would 
feature 

evaluations for each respective class. The 
format is relatively simple: All of the data is 
quantitative — comments are not included in 
the report — and publication is limited only to 
professors who have taught longer than seven 
terms. Only those with a University uniqname 
will be able to access the data.

Some officials have expressed concern that 

the release of the data could have devastating 
effects on faculty who receive poor ratings, 
but because nothing is invasive or personal, 
this claim is questionable. 

Given faculty concern over the usefulness 

of the evaluations, the University should 
invest its resources in the expertise of 
researchers to improve the survey to ensure 
it provides constructive feedback for both 
teachers and students. In the meantime, 
the University should release the current 
version of course evaluation results as long as 
it makes extremely clear the purpose of the 

collected data: It is not meant to replace other 
professor-ranking sites like ratemyprofessor.
com. Only once the University frames course 
evaluations in the proper context and makes 
improvements could this be possible.

Flaws in the design of the evaluations 

aren’t the only problem. Instead of investing 
time and money into developing a separate 
website to publish the data, the University 
should work to create a central database 
for all course-related needs. Incorporating 
the data into Wolverine Access instead 
would simplify backpacking and planning 
by making all of the necessary resources 
readily available: Students could read syllabi, 
course descriptions and professor ratings 
all in the same place. A more in-depth 
evaluation coupled with a more integrated 
scheduling process could go a long way for 
students looking to make the most of their 
 

credit hours.

Course evaluations in their current form 

may not aid students in choosing classes, but 
releasing them should be a relatively painless 
process. If, however, the University is open to 
improving upon the course-evaluation system 
in the near future, it would be a welcomed 
step in the direction of a simpler scheduling 
method and, consequently, satisfied student 
and faculty bodies.

Wolverines fall to 
Penn State in five

By LANEY BYLER

For the Daily

The 
enthusiasm 
seemed 

infectious Wednesday night in 
Cliff Keen Arena as the Michigan 
women’s 
volleyball 
team 
took 

the 
lead 

over No. 5 Penn State during the 
second and third sets.

The 23rd-ranked Wolverines 

set forward an offensive initiative 
during the second set, and 
the teams remained intensely 
close for the majority of the 
match. Smart offensive plays by 
Michigan and small defensive 
mistakes by the Nittany Lions 
ended up swinging the set in the 
Wolverines’ favor, 25-22.

Michigan took the third set 

as well, but it was unable to 
maintain its intensity for the rest 
of the match. The Nittany Lions 
ultimately rallied to pick up a 
hard-fought victory, 3-2.

The Wolverines may not have 

been able to hold on for the 
upset, but they thrived on the 
experience.

“We love those situations,” 

said junior middle blocker Abby 
Cole. “A five-set match against 
a team like Penn State, that’s an 
awesome place to be.”

Cole set the pace during the 

second set and continued it 
throughout the rest of the match, 
ending with a total of 14 kills.

The third set favored Michigan 

as well, with senior setter Carly 
Warner proving to be a valuable 
asset to the success of the team. 
Warner had a solid 29 assists 
with a single kill, helping turn out 
another set for the Wolverines, 
25-18, to put them in the lead, two 
sets to one.

The first and fourth sets 

turned out to be strikingly 

similar, with Michigan initially 
leading, only for Penn State to 
regroup defensively and retaliate 
with some hard hits of their own 
by senior outside hitter Aiyana 
Whitney, who led the game 
offensively with 18 kills and 40 
total attacks.

In the fifth and final set, both 

teams were visibly geared up for 
a battle. Penn State took up a solid 
defensive strategy in the back 
row unleashed a strong attack, 
which the Wolverines couldn’t 
seem to keep a hold on.

Despite Penn State’s attack, 

two defensive players managed to 
keep Michigan afloat during the 
fifth set — sophomore defensive 
specialist Caroline Knop and 
senior 
defensive 
specialist 

Lindsey 
Lerg. 
Despite 
their 

strong defense, the Wolverines 
fell in the fifth set, 15-7, with the 
Nittany Lions taking home the 
win.

“We talk about fifth sets all 

time in our locker room,” Knop 
said. “We talk about winning 
those. We’re going to be in dog 
fights for the remaining 11 games 
of our season this year, and we 
talk about that all the time.”

Michigan’s next game will 

be 
Saturday 
at 
Cliff 
Keen 

Arena against No. 6 Ohio State. 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
praised his team’s performance 
against Penn State, claiming that 
the experience helped the team 
mature, though it didn’t end with 
a win.

“Maturity 
comes 
with 

experience,” Rosen said. “To 
gain experience, I think tonight 
was a great learning opportunity 
for us. We’ll be in this situation 
a lot more over the next month, 
and I assume we’ll continue to 
get better and better in those 
situations, and we’ll end up on the 
other side.”

Bielfeldt settling in at Indiana

Former Michigan 
forward prepares 

for final year 

following transfer

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

As he did last season, Max 

Bielfeldt 
will 
play 
Big 
Ten 

basketball this year. But given 
his new school, new state and 
new academic routine, the list 
of similarities pretty much stops 
there.

Bielfeldt 
transferred 
from 

Michigan to Indiana following 
his 
senior 
season 
with 
the 

Wolverines in 2014-15, accepting 
an offer from the Hoosiers after 
considering attending Iowa State 
and 
Nebraska, 
among 
other 

programs.

The lone senior on Michigan’s 

roster last season, Bielfeldt joins 
an Indiana squad that features 
three others players in their final 
year of eligibility. He’ll have a 
chance to make an immediate 
impact, 
too, 
despite 
playing 

sparse minutes last year for the 
Wolverines.

Following the May dismissals 

of two Indiana big men — Hanner 
Mosquera-Perea and Devin Davis 
— the Hoosiers were looking for 
help in the post. Mosquera-Perea 
was set to graduate anyway, and 
the dismissal of Davis, then a 
junior, only deepened the hole in 
their roster.

“They said they are in need of a 

versatile big who can score the ball 
in a multitude of ways,” Bielfeldt 
told the Indianapolis Star in May, 
“and that I’m just the guy who 
could come in and help them.”

It hasn’t taken Bielfeldt long to 

notice distinct differences in the 
coaching styles of Indiana coach 
Tom Crean and Michigan coach 
John Beilein. Crean’s offense is 
less rigid in terms of cuts and the 
freedom to make plays, Bielfeldt 
said, and the teams’ logistical 
practices 
and 
communication 

styles vary substantially as well.

“Coach Beilein has a month’s 

schedule printed out for us in 
advance,” Bielfeldt said Oct. 15 at 
Big Ten Media Day in Rosemont, 
Illinois. “(With) Coach Crean, 
you get a text three hours before 
practice.”

In some respects, Bielfeldt 

left Ann Arbor just in time. 
This season, Beilein has taken 
to scheduling occasional 6 a.m. 
practices, something Michigan’s 
ninth-year coach said he’s never 
done in his four decades in the 
business.

The new practice reached 

Bielfeldt’s 
radar 
quickly. 
Of 

Michigan’s 
current 
players, 

Bielfeldt said he speaks the most 
with the two closest to him in age: 
senior guards Spike Albrecht and 
Caris LeVert, the latter of whom 
is his former roommate.

“Spike was telling me about 

that,” Bielfeldt said. “I think he 
got it from (Michigan football 
coach Jim) Harbaugh.”

Beyond 
the 
on-court 

differences, Bielfeldt’s day-to-
day life outside of basketball 
is drastically different, too. As 
part of a 15-month master’s 
degree 
program 
in 
strategic 

management, Bielfeldt is taking 
classes exclusively online. The 
plan is to leave Bloomington after 
having earned a second degree in 
only one year.

Bielfeldt’s 
academic 
plan 

depended heavily on his school 

selection. Iowa State, for instance, 
tempted him with its impressive 
agriculture program, especially 
considering 
Bielfeldt’s 
father 

earned a degree in agricultural 
economics.

Ultimately, Indiana’s Kelley 

School of Business proved tough 
to turn down.

“I’m happy coming here and 

doing the management degree,” 
Bielfeldt said. “I think I made the 
right choice.”

Throughout the process of 

selecting a transfer destination, 
Bielfeldt 
cited 
Indiana’s 

proximity to his family’s home in 

Peoria, Illinois, as one of the most 
important factors. Bielfeldt is still 
not particularly close, but the 
drive from Bloomington to Peoria 
is more than an hour shorter than 
the drive from Ann Arbor.

All 
things 
considered, 
it’s 

not a bad deal for Bielfeldt. 
He’s closer to home, and he’s 
getting a master’s degree and 
the opportunity to play another 
season in the Big Ten.

He will, however, have to travel 

to Ann Arbor on Feb. 2 to face his 
alma mater.

“It’s going to be bizarre,” 

Bielfeldt said.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Max Bielfeldt will be a fifth-year graduate transfer at Indiana this season.

Rosen cites defeat 
as tool for growth

By AVI SHOLKOFF

For the Daily

Michigan 
volleyball 
coach 

Mark Rosen believes his team 
will use its most recent loss as a 
learning experience.

Rosen quoted a long-standing 

expression when discussing the 
Wolverines’ loss to Penn State on 
Wednesday.

“What doesn’t kill you makes 

you stronger,” Rosen said. “(The 
loss is) not gonna kill us — it’s a 
volleyball game.”

The 

23rd-ranked 
Wolverines 
(5-4 Big Ten, 
15-5 
overall) 

fell to No. 5 
Penn 
State 

(7-2, 18-2) in 
five sets at Cliff 
Keen Arena on 
Wednesday. 
The team lost 
in 
the 
first 

set before notching victories in 
the second and third sets, and 
ultimately dropping the final two.

On 
a 
positive 
note 
for 

Michigan, 
its 
core 
players 

returned to the court for the 
first time in several games. 
 

Sophomore defensive specialist 
Caroline Knop played for the 
first time since the Wolverines’ 
victory over Michigan State on 
Oct. 3. Senior defensive specialist 
Tiffany Morales also returned to 
action after missing the previous 
game against Maryland.

“Because of some injuries, we 

haven’t had the same lineup very 
much in the past few weeks,” 
Rosen said. “That’s part of having 
depth.”

Rosen utilized many players 

throughout the match, including 
Knop in her natural defensive 
position despite using her as an 
outside hitter for parts of the last 
two seasons.

“It was fantastic to be out 

there,” Knop said. “We did a great 
job of mixing (the positions) up.”

Despite the loss, Knop and 

junior middle blocker Abby Cole 

expressed optimism regarding the 
team’s performance. Michigan 
played its hardest-fought match 
against a ranked team this season 
— they had previously fallen to 
then-No. 20 Purdue and then-No. 
4 Nebraska in three and four sets, 
respectively.

This time, the Wolverines 

faced a mature Nittany Lions 
team that kept fighting, even after 
losing two sets in a row. Penn 
State scored the first three points 
in overtime and cruised to a 15-7 
victory in the fifth set.

“They 

came out and 
absolutely 
punched us in 
the face,” Knop 
said. 
“That’s 

something we 
gotta get better 
at. In the locker 
room, we talk 
about winning 
fifth sets.”

Rosen 

explained that the team spent 
the last few days practicing 
point scoring, defensive drills 
and points in transition. Much to 
Rosen’s disappointment, it was 
not enough time.

The loss only motivates the 

team as No. 6 Ohio State visits 
Cliff Keen Arena on Saturday. 
The game has implications not 
only because both Michigan and 
the Buckeyes are ranked, but also 
because of the rivalry between 
the two teams. Ohio State leads 
the series, 52-20.

Players like Knop eagerly await 

the Buckeyes.

“We cannot wait to get them in 

our house,” she said. “We have to 
absolutely attack people.”

Rosen and his team will take 

many lessons from Wednesday 
night’s game against such a 
challenging team. They will go 
back to practice to fine-tune the 
same aspects they have worked on 
in the days since their last game.

And 
after 
a 
little 
more 

improvement, they may be strong 
enough to get past their tough Big 
Ten competition.

It was a cold afternoon as I made the turn onto North Fifth Avenue. The 

streets were empty as I turned toward the large Ann Arbor Farmers Market 
enclosure. Despite the brisk October weather, the Sunday Artisan Market was 
fairly busy. Several artists lined the sidewalks under the overhang and a small 
group of customers were making their way up and down the aisles, stopping 
to talk to the artists or to try on something that caught their eye. Walking 
down the aisle, one could find a huge diversity of goods, everything from large 
pieces of wood furniture to tiny pieces of jewelry. Each of these items had an 
artist to go with them, ready and willing to share what they made and how 
they made it.

The market was founded in 1991 by a group of local artists with one major 

phrase in mind: “From our hands to yours.” Each piece of work sold at the 
market is handmade, and is usually sold by the person who made it.

Meghan Lee, the market’s manager, expanded on the market’s aims in an 

interview with the Michigan Daily.

“The goal of the market is to provide that space to bring art to the community,” 

Lee said. “Also certainly sell (the artists’) work … and to help new artists grow.”

One of the most striking elements of the market is the wide array of products 

sold there. Just walking down the aisle I saw photos, jewelry made from several 
different materials, soap, clothing, hats and wooden furniture.

“I think there’s a lot of amazing work here in totally different veins,” Lee said 

“You can get fantastic soap, made by local artisans, that are more affordable 
than if you were to get some specialty soap at some fancy store,” Lee said.

Though Lee indicated that the diversity of the wares often naturally equals 

itself out, she also said. Sometimes the market will put caps on the number of 
sellers within a certain category.

“Each Sunday market differs,” Lee said. “Some artists come annually, others 

hold a booth for a full year and some just come for a day.”

Indeed, the difference between my two visits to the market was noticeable. 

The second Sunday was a beautiful fall day and the market was noticeably 
busier. Many people milled around the artists lining the sides of the enclosure, 
sifting through the myriad of products that hadn’t appeared the week before.

The market also does a few events each year, the biggest one being when 

self-titled Urban Fairyologist Jonathan Wright comes to sell posters and lead a 
scavenger hunt throughout Kerrytown. The market also features demonstration 
days, where, as long as it’s safe, artists will show off how they make their 
products. Live musicians stop by as well; at my second visit, local artist Ed 
Dupas played.

“I think the music definitely adds atmosphere to the market, (providing) a 

nice background.” Lee said, of the music.

She added that the artists also support the musical presence when it’s there. 

“I’ll usually send around an envelope because artists will contribute, too, because 
it’s nice to have them here. You just want to make it a worthwhile opportunity 
for them, too. We appreciate (that) they’re adding to the market.”

No season is more important to the market than the holiday season, which is 

the time of year artists often feature small trinkets or pieces of art that can be 
given as small gifts. 

Peter Smith, a woodworker who sells his carved furniture at the market, also 

noticed growth in his sales around the holiday season. “Towards the holiday, 
more and more people really are out looking for holiday gifts. A lot of the artisans 
have very unique products to offer,” he said

And just as the products sold are diverse, so are the stories of how the artists 

got to where they are now.

Teresa Kovalack, who has been going to the market for four years, makes 

crafts from repurposed items, such as birdhouses from teapots or garden decor 
from silverware. After she got pregnant, she started to make crafts after starting 
out as a painter. One of the aspects of her work that she emphasized is how each 
piece she makes is different from the other.

“I don’t think anybody should have two of the same thing because nobody’s alike. 

So, why make things alike?” Kovalack noted.

Mary Green Kerr is new to the market, having only been there for four weeks 

when we spoke. She makes products from fused glass, including jewelry and 
coasters that have pictures embedded in the middle.

“I lost five in my family in one year, including my dad. My husband says, 

why not get a little microwave kiln,” she said. “It gives me something to do. I’m 
actually a photographer. I got into glass as a side, and I’ve been messing around 
with it ever since.”

She continued to explain why she ended up selling her work at the market.
“We thought it would be easier because I sell on Etsy, where you can’t really 

get the feel of the glass,” she added. “Being a photographer, I can’t take product 
photos very well … I thought, ‘get it out where people would see it.’ (And) it’s 
been doing good.”

Some of the artists are retired workers, who picked up their pastime after leaving 

their jobs and were looking for something to do.

Smith, a retired teacher, started a woodworking company called Pleasant Lake 

Hardwood with a longtime friend who owns a wood lot.

“I went to him and said ‘Let’s use up some of the lumber we’ve sawed up for 

years, start a small business,’” Smith said. “We found that selling lumber is much 
harder than we thought, or at least that I thought. I thought we’d just do some value 
added. We’re both woodworkers, so we started selling these Leopold Benches at the 
market about four years ago.”

The Daily Defeats 

the State News

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind visit the same 

place and write about their experiences.

baked.buzzed.bored.

this week’s destination:

The Daily vs. State News Game was actually way more enjoyable than I thought it would be. While 

I generally abhor crowds, yelling about dumb things and standing next to beautifully open seats, I was 
surprisingly entertained by watching people I vaguely recognize running around on a field and actually 
doing a great job of catching/throwing a ball. (Shout out to the brave souls on the team/organizers of the 
game, you guys were great.)

 

Tonight I found what I was looking for when I went to the football games at my high 

school. There was actual school spirit and a sport that’s just boring enough to give 

everyone enough time to chat about vagina hearts and other essential sub-

ject matter. This game gave me the “Friday Night Lights” experi-

ence I’ve always dreamed of, minus hooking up behind the 

bleachers. (At least I didn’t hook up behind the bleach-

ers. Did anyone else? Was there a bleacher orgy 

that I wasn’t invited to? E-mail our edi-

tors at foxy.michigandaily6969@

michigandaily.gov if you’ve got 

any scoop). (Cards on the table, I’ve 

never seen “Friday Night Lights,” I have 

projected enough of an idealized high school 

experience to pretend, though.)

I’m high enough to get real with you guys — I didn’t love the 

Michigan/Michigan State rivalry I saw tonight. I understand friendly 

competition, but there’s a very hard edge to this one. I heard some rather 

vicious things from both sides of the field tonight. I don’t consider the fact that 

someone goes to a different school than me reason enough to make fun of the way they 

talk or act. And personally, I reject the idea that trashing someone else’s school reinforces 

the pride I have for mine.

Downside to the game: It was cold as night on Neptune. Which is very cold. Yeah, I did my astronomy 

reading this week. A fellow Daily Arts writer was dealing with some very pointy nipples as a result of this 
weather. So the main lesson from this is: Wear your damn jackets and GO BLUE! 

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

Since Baked and Buzzed missed most of the first half, 

for what should be obvious reasons considering the 

impromptu nature of this segment, I have to bear 

the burden of having the only full account of 

the game for this addition of BBB. But, I am 

merely an Arts writer with no real insights 

into how to properly report a game of 
football (or any sporting event, for that 
matter). So I’ll try to stay within my 
wheelhouse of television criticism in 
order to report what I witnessed on a 
cold Friday night.

 To describe the differences 

between the two football teams repre-
senting their respective student newspa-

pers is to compare the two seasons of Nic 

Pizzolato’s anthology series, “True Detec-

tive.” On the one hand, there’s the well-con-

structed first season — sure, in hindsight there are 

some flaws, but overall it’s strong through all eight epi-

sodes. Then, there’s the second season — jumbled, confusing 

and no one really knows what’s going on. This results in a project that is, at best, half as strong 
as its predecessor. Considering the Daily’s 8-4 victory over the State News, it’s pretty easy to 
guess which is the first season.

That’s not to stay the State News isn’t without its merits. Every program is inclined to have 

its showstopper moment, like a pick six or catch that would make any wide receiver jealous. But 
the lack of internal consistency calls to mind a Ryan Murphy series. Sure, there’ll be some fun, 
but is it really worth sitting through the whole thing?

When it comes to a showdown of school newspaper football prowess, the Daily proved to be 

“The Americans” to the State News’s “Allegiance” — older, wiser and just better in the long run.

—MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS

Like any self-respecting pregamers, we arrive after things 

are already underway — apparently it’s 1-1. I’ll admit first off 
that I’m not exactly falling down drunk on the sideline. In 
fact, I’m loving that I took a few shots of rum in the name of 
journalism right before, because now I’m the only one who’s 
carefree about how goddamn cold it is. I mean, people are 
squatting and jumping just to stay alive on the sidelines, and 
I’m all cozy with Captain Morgan snuggled up inside me.

I’m telling you, though, when I’m listing off the great 

Daily alumni, Alex Taylor’s name will be uttered right 
between Adam Schefter’s and Arthur Miller’s. Chasing him 
down is like trying to two-hand-touch a cyclone, except that 
cyclone can also suddenly plant his back foot and bomb a 
ball 50 yards into the hands of a wide open receiver. Hey 
look at me being a sports writer #artsdoessports.

You know Snooze is hardcore because they yell “bitch” 

after every first down they get. They also sing the entire 
fight song after every 20 yards they gain, but hey, I guess 
you gotta take the small victories however they come.

Things get rough and tumble in the 2nd half. We see some 

guys bent over across the field, and we wonder what they’re 
looking for. I guess a Spartan lost a tooth? Daily Arts discus-
sion ensues over whether our player is to blame or if it’s sim-
ply poor dental hygiene. Taylor also gets legit tackled, but 
he recovers and throws three straight touchdowns to make 
it 7-3 because only one of them counted? Snooze made us 

score thrice, and each of the first two times we jump the gun and scream “The Victors” anyway.

We let them score quickly just so we can get the ball back and finish it. In Alex Taylor we 

trust, and sure enough, suddenly we’re running across the field forming a mob in the endzone. 
My voice is shot but I still screech out a few “It’s great! To be! A Michigan Wolverine!”s. Eleven 
in a row, squad. We did it — we ran out of fingers.

So like 11 percent of my brain deep down knows that, from a neutral point of view, we’re the 

bad guys. We’re the undeniably more talented, unstoppable team that just destroys the under-
dog happy ending every time. And I feel a little cruel doing that, but then I see Snoozers who 
actually truly in their heart of hearts believe they have a better paper than us, and I realize it’d 
be even crueler to let them stay ignorant and delusional. Sorry little bro, that crushing disap-
pointment you feel every year? It’s just tough love.

Ann Arbor resident Jean 

Walter has been going to the 
market for 10 years and was 
looking for something to do 
after retiring from a secretarial 
position at the University. So, 
she started knitting and selling 
her scarves and hats at the mar-
ket. She has lived in Ann Arbor 
for many years.

She emphasized the thrill of 

seeing people try on her hats. As 
I interviewed her, a few people 
walked up to her booth, and 
Walter’s face lit up each time. 
Walter was happy to talk to the 
customers and say how good the 
hats looked on their heads.

Talking to the artists, one 

characteristic kept popping up: 
the sense of comradery and sup-
port that exists among the sellers. 
Several of them talked about how 
other artists in the market sup-
port them and how a community 
has formed among the artisans.

“Everybody’s so nice.” Kerr 

said. “The first day here, we 
didn’t know anything. Every-
body’s coming over to us. (We) 
made a lot of friends. It’s a nice 
atmosphere.”

Kovalack spoke of how she felt 

inspired by the other artists in 
the market. “A lot of us will talk 
amongst ourselves, and visit 
each other and see our differ-
ent art. It inspires you to have 
somebody say, ‘well that could 
be ... ’ or ‘you might wanna ... ’ (I 

enjoy) being around people that 
are like-minded and creative.”

She also told a story about 

how 
she 
helped 
an 
artist 

improve their product, saying, 
“I had said to the rock guy, he 
had made toilet paper holders 
out of his rocks. He takes a rock, 
he puts a rod-iron on it, and 
he makes it into a toilet paper 
holder … I said to him, have you 
thought about making it into a 
plant stand, and he’s like, ‘oh my 
god, that would be so cool. I’m 
gonna do that.’ ”

For many artists, the Ann 

Arbor location is key to the mar-
ket’s success. A wide array of 
locals patronize the market, some 
of whom are people who come 
many weeks in a row.

“(The artists) have return cus-

tomers that know where they 
are,” Lee said. “I’ll get a lot of 
inquiries here in the office like 
‘Where’s so-and-so? I haven’t 
seen them. I thought they were 
gonna be here.’ ” Her response is 
usually, “Well, they’ll probably be 
here next week.”

“It might be a cliché to say, 

but Ann Arbor is a community 
that clearly supports local busi-
ness efforts,” Smith said. “I can 
say with confidence that most 
of the artists are local business 
people. I think Ann Arbor sup-
ports local, they support art. 
Clearly it’s the type of town, 
because of the University and 
the population here, they’re 
clearly in support of art.”

However, the market’s popu-

lation isn’t exclusively locals. 
Kovalak said that over half her 
sales are from tourists who are 
from out of town.

“I’ve had my teapot birdhous-

es go to New York, New Mexico, 
England, New Jersey, Indiana 
and the Chicago area. It’s neat 
to see my art travel. I like that, 
to know somebody from Eng-
land has one of my birdhouses.”

Lee encouraged students to 

take advantage of the market 
as a way to put their name out 
there and make a little bit of 
money in the process.

“We’re always looking for new 

artists. Whether it’s students, (or) 
anyone (else) that makes things 
… I welcome them to go through 
the application process. There 
isn’t much risk. You can come and 
see how it goes. I think it’s a great 
place to get started.”

Lee put it best when she said, 

“The artists are the heart of the 
market.”

And, after spending time in 

the market, nothing could be 
more true. It’s the artists that 
make spending time in the mar-
ket a worthwhile way to spend 
a Sunday. Listening to their 
pride and enthusiasm as they 
describe their process and talk 
about their pieces made for an 
entertaining couple of hours 
and brightened up an incredibly 
cold day.

The next big event for the Ann 

Arbor Farmers Market is their 
Holiday Open House, which takes 
place Nov. 15.

SINGLE REVIEW

 “Hip Hop is over for me,” 
Kanye declared in 2008, more 
a statement 
about his 
upcoming art 
than an expla-
nation for his 
recent behav-
ior. He had just 
lost his mother 
to a heart 
attack and his 
fiancée to a 
break-up, and, 
in turn, had stunned us all with 
the innovative 808s & Heart-
break. The emotional project, 
full of minimalist beats, chilled 
synths and unconventional auto-
tune, helped create the Kanye we 
know and (sometimes) love today 
— a universal icon, tastemaker 
and trendsetter. 
 And now, in 2015, he returns 
to the album that began his tran-
scendence into god-like status. 
In September, he performed 
808s in its entirety at the Holly-
wood Bowl. And on Monday, he 

released two new tracks on his 
Soundcloud page, one a remix of 
the album’s opening track, “Say 
You Will.” Yeah, Kanye has a 
Soundcloud now, verified by rap-
per Travis Scott, who posted an 
Instagram of the track with the 
caption “It Starts.”
 What’s starting exactly? Yeezy 
season, and hopefully, the rollout 
of his new album, SWISH. And 
what a way to begin — with this 

explosive version of one of 808s’s 
best, featuring vocals and com-
position by Caroline Shaw, 2013 
winner of the Pulitzer Prize for 
Music. The fusion of contempo-
rary classical music and hip hop 
is unconventional but not unex-
pected from Ye. And this track 
is both a tribute to his dark past 
and a nod to his bright future.

‘Crimson Peak’ is an 
excellent Goth-rom

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

A word of caution: don’t watch 

the “Crimson Peak” trailer. And 
don’t even dare glance at its pro-
motional 
post-

ers, because, as 
its heroine cor-
rects us, “It’s not 
a ghost story. 
It’s a story with 
ghosts in it.” The 
ghastly market-
ing, 
promising 

a minefield of 
gore and stock 
horror at every 
turn, deters from the film’s legiti-
mate triumph that under Guill-
ermo Del Toro’s (“Pacific Rim”) 
operatic vision, a well-trodden tale 
of Gothic romance creaks back to 
life. And that, my friends, is why 
the focus should be on “Crimson 
Peak” — the film, and the film only.

It’s high society New York at the 

turn of the century, and the elegant 
dresses, coiffed hair and well-
ironed businessmen are all bathed 
in a sumptuous gold glow. The 
aristocratic Sir Thomas Sharpe 
(Tom Hiddleston, “The Avengers”) 
sweeps in from across the pond 
and captures the heart of Edith 
Cushing (Mia Wasikowska, “The 
Kids Are All Right”), the daugh-
ter of a wealthy, self-made indus-
trialist. Yet Edith, a strong-willed 
girl writing novels about ghosts, 
is no stranger to darkness. Since 
her youth, her mother’s ghost has 

visited her — a spidery, slithery 
figure with a terrifyingly raspy 
voice, designed with slick style 
rather than camp — and warned 
to beware Crimson Peak. Viewers 
notice what Edith does not: Even 
as her lips meet her charming suit-
or’s for the first time, the lighting is 
split between the two, gold on her 
and a passionately burning crim-
son on him. When a tragic mur-
der leaves her father dead, she’s 
whisked away to eerie Allerdale 
Hall, home to Sharpe and his sister 
(Jessica Chastain, “Interstellar”), 
where past spirits come back and 
the resplendent color palette fades 
cold and bleak as Edith unearths 
the old home’s secrets.

Wasikowska and Hiddleston 

are 
absolutely 
bewitching 

together, the ingénue and her 
dark prince taking on a modern 
sensibility 
when 
reimagined 

with Wasikowska’s intelligent 
gaze and Hiddleston’s growing 
introspection. With her immac-
ulate poise, Chastain, too, is 
seductively sinister. She takes on 

a cruel form of beauty, her face 
almost always unreadable but 
simmering with expertly bottled 
rage. The three leads, excellent 
individually, play off each oth-
er’s emotions well, and together, 
they stitch together a past where 
love, deceit, sacrifice and shame 
blaze as intensely as the red clay 
marking everything in Allerdale 
Hall ominously.

The 
performances, 
lavish 

costumes, stark contrast in set 
design between Edith’s old and 
new homes intertwine marvel-
ously with Del Toro’s always deft 
handling of characters’ emotional 
ecstasy. Though the plot is thin and 
predictable, the immersive Gothic 
atmosphere pays homage to hor-
ror’s classics. Only in the film’s 
excessively gory climax does the 
meticulously constructed build-
up falter and devolve into camp. A 
film whose heroine refuses to pan-
der to popular tastes in her fiction 
for the sake of mass appeal should 
follow suit. While there are some 
legitimately terrifying scenes that 
do venture into the realm of mod-
ern horror, this denouement felt 
thrown in just to fit the film into a 
genre that it’s not.

With temperatures dropping, 

skies darkening, and leaves brown-
ing to decay, it might be to escape 
the midterm scuffle into the arms 
of a charming English gentleman 
with a questionable past, because 
despite the many warnings to 
“beware Crimson Peak,” its pull is 
far too seductive to ignore.

Seven Mile Music 
in ‘The Key of B’

‘U’ students 

document music 

education in Detroit

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

Just off I-96, bordered by Ever-

green, Telegraph and Puritan Road 
in the northwestern portion of the 
city of Detroit is a four-square-
mile quadrant named Brightmoor. 
Aesthetics reveal the sad reality 
that exists within this four-mile 
neighborhood: Tattered buildings, 
buckling roofs, abandoned homes, 
ill-kept parks and shattered win-
dows all add to Brightmoor’s air of 
ominous emptiness. The murder 
rate in Brightmoor is 800 percent 
higher than the national average. 
The heavy crime rates led Bright-
moor’s population to decrease by 
35.3 percent from 2000 to 2010 
alone. Three Brightmoor schools 
were closed between 2005 and 
2012 as a result of budget cuts, 
lack of funding and debt, affecting 
about 900 students.

The statistics associated with 

Brightmoor are bad — if not the 
worst — in terms of the area’s high 
murder and low graduation rates. 
Economically, Brightmoor holds 
no sustainable markets. Socially, 
the neighborhood of Brightmoor 
is ruled by the powers of drugs 
and gangs. The Wikipedia page 
on Brightmoor is dire, the media 
coverage on Brightmoor holds a 
general attitude of concern and 
the oral, statewide reputation of 
the neighborhood remains as the 
worst part of town in one of our 
country’s most frightful cities.

And yet, despite the seemingly 

unalterable fate of Brightmoor, 
strands of hope have started to 
weave into the community. Com-
munity centers, churches and 
schools have begun to team up in 
within and outside of the neigh-
borhood. After-school programs, 
creative expression workshops 
and church functions have become 
heavily implemented to provide 
outlets to the violent forces that 
rule the surrounding neighbor-
hood. A butterfly garden has been 
placed in what was once the most 
dangerous intersection in Bright-
moor. A local church started pro-
viding contraceptives and meals 
to male streetwalkers in attempts 
to weaken the economic and 
social grip that prostitution has 
on the community. The Bright-
moor community, and many more 
like it within the city of Detroit, 
is searching for outlets. They are 
calling out for any new channel of 
hope that will redirect or deter the 
negative influencers of the com-
munity. Many are uniting under 
the hope that human goodness can 
cure a situation most dire.

Current SMTD Senior Sam 

Saunders offered up such a chan-
nel to Detroit communities in the 
fall of 2013. It was then that Saun-
ders established a student-run 
organization, Seven Mile Music, 
which would work to provide free 
music lessons to inner-city youths 
in Detroit. Collecting teachers and 
their instruments from within the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance, 
Saunders and his organization 
arranges weekly trips to several 
community centers throughout 
the city — including Brightmoor — 
to teach basic instrumentation to 
anyone interested.

In 
the 
larger 
historical, 

economic and social framework 
of struggling communities like 
Brightmoor and Woodbridge, 
the Seven Mile Music program 
can appear hopeful but small. 
And yet, when standing in 
comparison to the disparaged 
and 
damaged 
communities, 

the 
organization 
shines 

effervescently.

Last semester, when searching 

for a possible topic of exploration 
for 
their 
documentary 
class, 

three students in the University’s 
Department of Screen Arts and 
Cultures 
noticed 
the 
beauty 

lying within Saunders’s musical 
mission. After participating in 
the Seven Mile Music program 
as a cello teacher, Jayden Hua, 
an Australian exchange student, 
introduced the topic of Seven Mile 
Music to his class with his two 
other group-mates, current LSA 
seniors Alexander Holmes and 
Maggie Marshall, as a possible 
avenue for a documentary.

After gaining approval from 

the professor and class, the three-
some set to work in document-
ing the Saunders organization 
and its respective influence on 
the community. Hua, according 
to Holmes, held a vision and was 
“interested in filming shit for a 
reason.” Holmes acted as the local 
that guided the documentarians 
through a neighborhood he had 
lived on the periphery of for most 
of his life. Having grown up prac-
ticing and performing with cathe-
dral choirs across Detroit, Holmes 
held an individual intimacy with 
the musicality associated with the 
Seven Mile Music project. And as 
a Grosse Pointe native, Holmes 
was able to introduce Hua to the 
crucial difference between Brigh-

THE “HOTLINE BLING” MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 Drake hasn’t been this close 
to a number one record since 
2009’s “Best I 
Ever Had”, and 
he’s hell-bent 
on making 
“Hotline Bling” 
his first. The 
desperation has 
culminated in 
his most shame-
lessly com-
mercial video to 
date, strategically released as the 
song peaks at number two. Ever 

since ©Drizzy Drake signed a $20 
million deal with Apple Music 
and released a coveted sneaker 
with Mr. Jumpman, it seems 
everything he touches turns into 
an extension of an endorsement 
deal (word to Midas).
 The Jordan brand logo is liter-
ally the centerpiece of the open-
ing shot, and the whole video 
feels like one of those old iPod 
commercials where the black sil-
houettes dance in front of mono-
chromatic backdrops. In fact, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if Apple 

managed most of the creative 
direction of the video. There’s 
something vaguely Jonathan Ive-
esque about the curved corners 
of the rectangular panels and the 
not-so-subtle color palette.
 The new OVO Fall/Winter col-
lection dropped less than a week 
ago, and damn near every single 
piece is showcased in the less 
than 5-minute video. Hilariously, 
the only out-of-season OVO item 
that makes an appearance is also 
the only one that hasn’t sold out 
on the online store – the cringe-

worthy “Woes” hat.
 Perhaps I’m being too criti-
cal. I mean, the song itself is 
fantastic; “Hotline Bling” was 
nothing short of an anthem last 
summer. Full credit to Drake 
for cashing out on his public 
image without allowing it to 
dilute his music. However, that 
doesn’t change the fact that for 
all of Drake’s uncomfortable 
dancing, he still isn’t the focal 
point of his own video.

ton and Brightmoor, and helped to 
explain to the others what the cul-
ture of this particularly ravaged 
portion of Detroit would entail. 
With Holmes and Marshall’s tech-
nical skills, and Hua’s passion to 
find the story, the group set to 
work in capturing the Seven Mile 
Music mission.

The 
rendered 
documentary, 

titled “The Key of B,” holds a depth 
of discovery. Although a majority 
of the documentary is spent relay-
ing the efforts and effects of Saun-
ders and his University-associated 
organization in Detroit communi-
ties, the short film quietly incorpo-
rates the spirit and heart already 
lying within the communities that 
Seven Mile Music touches. The 
incorporation of the perspectives 
and personal experiences of com-
munity leaders within Brightmoor 
and Woodbridge added immensely 
to the legitimacy, honesty and 
power of “The Key of B.”

Pastor Semmeal Thomas, Sr. 

at City Covenant Church is an 
irreplaceable leader of the Bright-
moor community. Holmes can-
didly describes him as the “glue to 
the society that holds the existing 
Brightmoor together.” As Thomas 
describes the necessity of creativ-
ity and imagination for societal 
reconstruction, the documentary 

pans in from a colorful mural, 
bursting dynamically from a for-
gotten concrete wall. Then, as 
Thomas’s wise narration contin-
ues, the camera fades back into 
a smiling child, guitar in hand, 
plucking curiously at the strings. 
And then echoing voices of church 
singers creep into sound, rever-
berating from the cathedral walls 
from which they emerge. The 
documentary reveals that which 
was not aesthetically or objectively 
obvious: There is hope here; there 
is beauty here.

“The Key of B” did phe-

nomenally well and received 
numerous accolades from the 
Department of Screen Arts and 
Cultures. The hard work and 
achievement that culminated in 
the documentary’s submission 
and nomination as a finalist in 
a local film competition, Film 
Challenge Detroit. The win-
ners of this festival are to be 
announced this week and will 
subsequently earn a trip to the 
upcoming Sundance Film Festi-
val. Similarly, Hua, upon return-
ing to Australia, began entering 
the documentary in local com-
petitions and festivals.

Winning at Film Challenge 

Detroit or garnering a follow-
ing in the Australian film circuit 

would be great personal successes 
for these early filmmakers. But, 
more importantly, the success of 
this documentary would repre-
sent a small success for the suf-
fering communities of Detroit like 
Brightmoor. The success of this 
short film implies an increased 
scope of exposure to the social 
ills of Detroit. Brightmoor, and 
other communities like it, would 
be more likely to receive recogni-
tion and support in their efforts 
of resurgence. A strong distribu-
tion of this short film could accrue 
more awareness for any peripheral 
forces that wish to help. They will 
effectively become more aware 
of what the community needs: 
The struggling pockets of Detroit 
do not crave financial and social 
reconstructions alone. They thirst 
for creative outlets. They covet 
avenues of innovation, explora-
tion and imagination. They desire 
those effective distractions. The 
artistic and imaginative forces 
within a society can become 
ignored during times of impover-
ishment and infrastructure col-
lapse, yet they are the saving grace 
to so many. “The Key of B” recog-
nizes this divide and, through this 
short film, attempts to bridge the 
gap that misunderstanding creates 
between creativity and poverty.

Turns out Cleveland 
isn’t as bad as it seems

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

For The Daily

You have probably heard that 

Cleveland is the birthplace of 
rock ‘n’ roll, but what you don’t 
know is that Cleveland is cur-
rently the hotbed of modern 
rock music.

Yes. There, I said it. Cleveland 

is actually good for something 
other than bad sports jokes. I, 
too, was unaware that Cleveland 
could be talked about positively 
until a year and a half ago when 
I saw The Moxies perform live at 
The Cleveland Agora. “Who are 
The Moxies?” you may ask. The 

Moxies, like several other bands 
from Cleveland, are a three-
piece rock band that are not 
only easy on the eyes, but easy 
on the ears as well. Their debut 
self-titled nine-track album was 
released in 2013 and I haven’t 
stopped listening to it since. 
Marco Ciofani’s gritty vocals, 
backed by Tyler Adams’s power-
ful bass and Landon Hall’s solid 
beat, make for a trio that makes 
you question everything that 
is wrong with the 21st century 
music industry. From “Night-
crawler” to “Raindance,” there 
isn’t one song that falls short of 
anything other than pure rock 

bliss. Their music is a throwback 
to when rock was popular and 
the radio wasn’t complete shit. 

Welshly Arms, like The Mox-

ies, is another rock band that 
puts popular music to shame. 
Welshy Arms is an amalgam of 
dirty rock and soulful blues; the 
product is music reminiscent 
of The Black Keys, The White 

Stripes and The Strokes, but 
10 times better because they 
haven’t had any mainstream 
exposure. The four-piece band 
started producing music in 2013 
with the release of their success-
ful EP Welcome. Their music 
video for “Two Seconds Too 
Late” has received over 60,000 
views on YouTube, and “The 
Touch” was featured on the 
CW’s “The Vampire Diaries.”

Recently Welshly Arms fol-

lowed up their 2014 Covers 
EP with their self-titled debut 
album. Songs off of the album, 
like “Love in a Minor Key” and 
“We Move Easy,” are just a few 
examples of how their lyrical 
brilliancy 
and 
instrumental 

creativity set them apart from 
mainstream “talented” bands 
that grace the stages during 
award show season.

In addition to constantly 

churning out new music over the 
past two years, Welshly Arms 
has made a name for themselves 
in the Cleveland music scene; 

I’ve been lucky enough to bare 
witness to their sold-out show at 
the Beachland Tavern and their 
explosive performance at the 
House of Blues Cleveland, both 
of which secured them local 
celebrity status. Just this past 
week, I saw Welshly Arms play 
two consecutive shows with the 
energy and enthusiasm that is 
absent in most touring bands.

Unlike most artists, Welshly 

Arms is a band that deserves 
to be played on the radio. The 
band’s music is timeless and 
classic, yet innovative. Classic 
rock vibes mixed with soulful 
blues undertones work togeth-

er to create a refreshing sound 
that is clearly distinct and sty-
listically the band’s own.

Welshly Arms is amazing, and 

will probably (hopefully) break 
out of Cleveland in the com-
ing months. The Moxies, on the 
other hand, have already left the 
gray tundra that is Cleveland. 
They now reside in Nashville, 
but every month or two they 
always grace us Clevelanders 
with a performance because 
they’re perfect and love to prove 
just how perfect they are. Not 
many bands out there can genu-
inely label themselves as rock, 
but Welshly Arms and The Mox-
ies can. If there is any hope for 
the survival of rock ‘n’ roll or 
good music as a whole, this is it, 
and it’s happening in Cleveland 
right now. Welshly Arms and 
The Moxies are just two phe-
nomenal rock bands, but in actu-
ality, Cleveland is harvesting 
countless talented bands that 
will give rock ‘n’ roll the rebirth 
it so desperately needs.

Cleveland is good 

for something.

Cleveland is 
the hotbed of 
modern rock.
