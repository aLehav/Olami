In his lecture "Capitalism Without Guilt: The Moral Case for Freedom," Yaron Brook, the president and executive director of The Ayn Rand institute, argued before a packed
crowd in the Chemistry Building that the government - not the failure of the free market - caused the nation's economic recession. For the full story, go to michigandaily.com.
CAMPUS DIVERSITY
'U' mulls gender-neutral housing

Spectrum Center,
ACLU team up to
back proposal
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
The University prides itself
on its diverse student and fac-
ulty bodies, championing what
officials consider a friendly and
open environment for those of all
backgrounds. But when students
apply for housing before fresh-
man year, there is no box for gen-

der preference.
The housing application asks
incoming freshman if they want
to live in a substance-free room,
whether they want a single, dou-
ble or triple room and where they
prefer to live on campus. But there
is no option for transgender stu-
dents looking for gender-neutral
housing.
That may soon change.
The University is considering a
proposal that was initially pitched
by the Spectrum Center Student
Advisory Board to create a gen-
der-neutral housing option geared
toward transgender students.

The proposal has not been sig-
nificantly acted upon since it was
first introduced last April, but is
picking up new momentum with
help from the campus undergrad-
uate chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
ACLU board member Ellen
Steele, an LSA sophomore, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
group made the proposal in an
effort to make University resi-
dence halls more inclusive.
"Our ultimate goal would be
to make gender-neutral hous-
ing available to all students in all
dorms," Steele wrote. "Students of

different genders can already live
in the same hall. There is no rea-
son they shouldn't be able to live
in the same room."
And it appears that many uni-
versities across the country would
agree.
According to the website gen-
derblind.org, there are currently
36 colleges and universities with
gender-neutral housing options,
including several schools the
University considers to be its
peer institutions like Brown
University, Dartmouth College,
Harvard University and Stan-

Building rights,
estate planning
among tools at
officials' disposal
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
and KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporters -
It's 10 a.m. and you can't find
your room key. After 10 minutes of
searching, you find it buried under
last week's laundry. You run out of
your dorm and make it to class just
in time to catch the last 15 minutes
of lecture. Having skipped break-
fast, you head to Mary Markley
Residence Hall to grab an early
lunch before you meet friends for
a study group at the library. After
hours of studying, you make your
way over to Hill Auditorium for a
concert.
In a typical day, students rush in
and out of the buildings that define
the character of campus - build-
ings that stand there because of
the University's major donors and
decision makers of yesteryear.
In fact, your residence hall was
named after Alice Lloyd, who was

the University's dean of women for
20 years. Stephen M. Ross paid for
part of the business school build-
ing where you arrived late to class.
Mary Markley Residence Hall,
where you ate lunch, was built in
honor of Mary Butler Markley,
who worked closely with alumni.
Your study group met in Hatcher-
Graduate Library, named in honor
of past University President Har-
lan H. Hatcher. You ended your
day with a concert at Hill Audito-
rium, which was built with money
bequeathed by former University
Regent Arthur Hill.
However, it isn't by chance that
every building you visited today
was named after an individual. In
fact, almost every building across
campus has been named in honor
of a prominent Universityleader or
a generous donor.
NAMING RIGHTS
The staff at the Office of Devel-
opment determines building and
program names following a very
specific set of procedures that dic-
tate who can name facilities and
the individualfor whom they can
be named.

MSA officials debate
community concerns

After history of
disruptions,
assembly considers
restricting speakers
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
Last night, the Michigan Stu-
dentAssemblydiscussed aresolu-
tion that, if passed, would revamp
the way community members are
allowed to address the assembly.
In the past, the "community
concerns" portion of the agenda
has been known to take up long
stretches ofmeetingtime.
In the last two semesters, MSA
meeting agendas were routinely
derailed during the community
concerns portion of the evening
by local activists promoting their
side of issues sometimes not
directly related to campus affairs.
Michael Benson, chair of the
Rules and Elections committee,
authored the resolution along
with Student General Counsel
Jim Brusstar. Benson said there
were more problems with the
community concerns time last
. year than this semester.

"When people are coming in
speaking to things that MSA has
no control over, or that MSA can-
not affect, it's a waste of time,"
Benson said.
The resolution would shorten
the time allotted to each speaker
from five minutes to three min-
utes.
It would also require speak-
ers to present a valid, unexpired
MCard. Those without a Univer-
sity affiliation would be able to
apply for time with MSA execu-
tives at least two business days in
advance.
Benson said the assembly
"wants to remain open." He said
the resolution is not intended to
discourage community members
from coming to speak.
But some representatives are
wary of the resolution's implica-
tions.

LSA senior Jillian Geyer
rode her firsc pony at age five
at a renaissance fair in Roches-
ter, Mich. Sixteen years later,
it's a passion she can't seem to
shake.
Geyer is a competitive
horseback rider and treasurer
for the University's Equestrian
Team- dubbed "The E Team"
by its members - whose goal
is to provide an outlet for stu-
dents who are passionate about
horseback riding.
Students compete in a num-
ber of regional competitions
throughout the year. The
region is made up of Michi-
gao universities- including
Michigan State University and
Oakland University -and one
Canadian competitor, the Uni-
versity of Western Ontario.
The two teams ranked the
highest in the region qualify
for zoned competitions, and

nationals.
Teams from Ohio, Kentucky
and Michigan all compete in
the same zone.
The last time the Univer-
sity's team reached zone com-
petitions was two years ago,
though it didn't qualify for
nationals. But LSA senior Kim
Leaman, the team's president,
said she thinks that this year
the team's chances are "pretty
good."
Students interested in
competing can choose from
either the Western or Hunter/
Jumper riding styles. Western
is a more modern style, while
Hunter/Jumper is a more clas-
sic, English technique.
Of the team's SO members,
only two are male.
"It's pretty laid back and
easygoing," Geyer said. "We
spend a lot of time together
and develop close bonds."

Aside from participating in-'
competitions, the team hosts _ n{
dinners, rodeo trips, movie ,r
nights and a variety of other a
activities. In addition, at the 4;
end of the season the team {
holds annual "Paper Plate
Awards," during which team
members joke about the year's
funny memories.,
"Last year I was injured
four times and still continued
riding. I was awarded 'The
Strength Award,"' Geyer said.
The team practices every

Commerce secretary
says clean energy key
to Midwest's future
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary
Locke told representatives of
Midwest states yesterday that the
growth of clean energy industries
is key to the region's economic re-
covery and future.
Locke said new federal efforts
such as a one-stop office in the De-
troit area to make his department's
services more accessible to busi-
nesses are part of a broader push to
jumpstart job creation.
"Our fight to build a new, clean
energy economy is just getting
started and it is a fight that we
simply must win," Locke said. His
remarks kicked off a two-day Mid-
western Governors Association's
Jobs and Energy Forum in Detroit.
Locke said the CommerceCon-
nect pilot program, if it's success-
ful, could be expanded to other
areas around the country. A ribbon
cutting was held yesterday at the
office in Plymouth, about 20 miles
west of Detroit. Staff will act as
case workers for individual busi-
nesses that seek assistance.

Although Schwarzenegger

Three Americans whose 1960s
research laid the foundation for
today's world of computerized imag-

shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in phys-
ics yesterday for their work develop-
ing fiber-optic cable and the sensor
at the heart of digital cameras.
Charles K. Kao, 75, was cited for

discovering how to transmit light
signals over long distances through
glass fibers as thin as a human hair.
His 1966 breakthrough led to the
creation of modern fiber-optic com-
munication networks that carry
voice, video and high-speed Internet
data around the world.
"Whatthewheeldidfortransport,
the optical fiber did for telecommu-
nications," said Richard Epworth,

in Harlow, England in the 1960s.
"Optical fiber enables you to trans-
mit information with little energy
over long distances and to transmit
information at very high rates."

ford University.
University Housing Spokes-
manPeterLogansaidhe is aware
that other. universities offer a
gender-neutral option, and that
he has been in contact with offi-
cials at those schools to explore
the option.
"We're watching those
schools and are in touch with
them so we can see what their
experiences and successes have
been," he said.
Logan said gender-neutral
housing is currently available
to students on an individual
basis. But those students must
approach the University on their
own to be considered for the
option.
Students must work with a
staff liaison to get an accommo-
dation that best fits their needs,
but according to the University
Housing website, there is no
guarantee students interested in
the option will receive it.
The website also states that
students are assigned rooms
according to their birth gender,
regardless of how they iden-
tify themselves. The University
will not consider accommoda-
tions for people unless they have
undergone sex reassignment
surgery.
Steele said the ACLU has con-
cerns about the current housing
policy, especially because, she
said, it is very uncommon for
college students who identify
as transgender to have already
undergone sex reassignment
surgery. Steele said that only
havingthe gender-neutral option
for post-op students is extremely
restrictive.
"This part of the policy sup-
ports the idea that a person's
body must look a certain way in
order for them to be treated as
the gender with which they iden-
tify," she wrote in the e-mail.
Steele said the current hous-
ing policy is biased in its gender

assumptions.
"It assumes two roommates
cannot be in a relationship if
they are the same gender," she
said. "It assumes women and
men cannot be just friends or
roommates.
"It demands that women are
fundamentally different from
men, and they should be segre-
gated," she continued. "I, and
many other students, believe
that the dorms should not be
divided along the traditional
gender binary."
Jackie Simpson, director ofthe
Spectrum Center, said the ideaof
gender-neutral housing is still in
its preliminary stages and that
students at the University have
been pushing for gender-neutral
housing for several years.
While she is hopeful, Simp-
son said she doesn't know when,
or even if, the proposal will be
implemented at the University.
Steele said ACLU group mem-
bers understand their proposal
will probably not be enacted
immediately, but that she hopes
the University will soon take
steps to implement the change
in policy.
"I live in the dorms, and I
believe our community could
benefit from gender-neutral
housing and would be strongly
supportive of a change to hous-
ing policy," she said.
Simpson said that with stu-
dent interest for the option, the
Spectrum Center is planning to
focus more intently on bringing
the option to campus.
"It would be important for
us to have a conversation and a
dialogue about (gender-neutral
housing) campus-wide, given
that students are interested in
the University looking into this,"
she said.
Logan said University Hous-
ing officials first need to see if
the larger student population
is interested in the option, but
added that officials are giving it
a "serious look."

The process of determining who
names buildings and facilities in
honor of individuals is not simple.
Depending on the size, location and
use of the facility in question, nam-
ing rights could simply be deter-
mined by the head of a department
or could require a vote by the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents.
In the case of new buildings,
naming rights are often given to
the donor who provides substantial
financial support, at least 50 percent
of a building's fundraising goal or
at least 33 percent of its estimated
construction cost. The donor can
then request to have the building
named after him or her, or suggest a
name for the building. For example,
donors who gave gifts for the con-
struction of the Michigan League
asked that the structure be called
the Michigan League. This same
situation occurred for the Michigan
Union and Alumni Memorial Hall.
The Facilities Naming Steering
Committee - chaired by the vice
president of development and com-
prised of the University's provost,
executive vice president for academ-
ic affairs, executive vice president,
chief financial officer and executive
vice president for medical affairs -
sends naming recommendations to
the University Board of Regents for
buildings that exceed $75 million in
cosa The regents then must approve
the recommendation before the
building can be named. In contrast,
the regents are not required to
approve names for small additions
or expansions to buildings, but the
Facilities Naming Steering Commit-
tee still must approve the name.
Similarly, regents do not need to
approve the naming of small inte-
rior or exterior spaces - includ-
ing benches, bricks and plaques.
Instead, the head of the department
where these items are located can
name them.
According to the Guidelines
for Naming Facilities, Spaces and
Streets, regents do not need to
endorse the names of individual
rooms or large interior spaces unless
the name is "unusually prominent,
sensitive or subject to heightened
public interest"
For large exterior spaces acces-
sible to the public - like plazas,
fields and malls - the.regents must
approve honorific names. But they
do not need to review names for
small exterior spaces like court-
yards.
The regents may name a building
inhonor oflivingor deceased donors
who have provided long-term finan-
cial support and have no existing
buildings named after them.
For a building to be named in
honor of a University leader, one
year must have passed since the
individual held the position for
which he is being honored. Simi-
larly, for buildings named in com-
memoration of a deceased leader,
one year must elapse between the
individual's death and when the
building is named.

MAJOR GIFTS

With the high stakes of keeping a
major donor happy, the University's
Office of Development has a Major
Gifts department that works to
maintain positive relationships with
donors and demonstrate howdonors'
resources can be used .to maintain
the educational experience students
receive at the University.
Though it may seem easy to clas-
sify the largest donors to the Uni-
versity, there is no central policy
that determines who falls into this
category.
Beth Halloran, assistant vice
president for development, said
some of the larger schools and col-
leges consider donations of$100,000
or more as major gifts, while small-
er schools, colleges and units deem
$25,000 a major gift.
For the most part, Halloran said
the majority of major gift donors are
between 50 to 70 years old, since
older individuals have had more
time to accumulate wealth - though
she said this is not always the case.
Additionally, Halloran said that
for many major donors, their gifts
aren't about the dollar amount writ-
ten on the check but rather about
signing their name on the check and
lending their credibility to the suc-
cess of the project.
"(They think) this is significant,
this defines who I am, this helps me
realize a dream that I've had in my
life about who I wan'tto be, this helps
me partner with my alma mater
about who I want them to be," Hal-
loran said. "Those visions and values
are really much more central to our
work than the commas and zeros."
Halloran said that becoming
a major gift donor is more than a
financial investment.
"It's also an identity invest-
ment, and it's also a legacy invest-
ment," Halloran said, explaining
that donors make public statements
when deciding to support a par-
ticular area like a museum, medical
research or an academic unit.

Reid's article fails to note Republican Party needs to
problems of overtime rules embrace moderate members

TO THE DAILY:
In response to Andy Reid's article supporting
college overtime rules, I have to disagree with a
few of his points (You gotta love college football
overtime, 10/04/2009). While college overtime
is indeed exciting, arbitrarily starting with the
ball on the 25-yard line completely alters the
strategy of the game. Special teams (aside from
mid to short-range field goal kicking) are thrown
out for overtime and teams with game-changers
on special teams are put atla disadvantage.
The possibility of a kickoff return for a touch-
down or blocked punt is nonexistent with the
college rules. Though coaches always preach
that special, teams are just as important as
offense and defense, the overtime rules fully
contradict that.
Similarly, college overtime rules alter the nor-
mal play calling of both offenses and defenses.
Offenses with the ball first in overtime play much
more conservatively, rarely running plays where
they could lose yardage knowing that they have
to score at least three points to stay in the game.
Defensive play calling is altered as well
because of the small margin of error defenses
have by starting on the 25-yard line. Certainblitz
packages and plays incorporating deeper over-
ages are rarely utilized given the starting posi-
tion of the offense. While the college overtime
system makes sense in that it gives each team a
chance to have the ball, a new system should be
created taking the positive aspects from both the
college and NFL overtime systems. A coin toss
can decide who gets possession first.
But just like the beginning of the first quar-
ter, one team should kick off to another, meaning
special teams are not disregarded. If the team
with the ball first scores, then it has to kick-off to
the other team, and the game isn't over until each
team has an equal number of possessions. While
the college overtime rules do create excitement,
the so-called "football" played in overtime is not
true "football." All aspects of the game should
be incorporated while giving both teams a fair
chance at winning.

TO THE DAILY:
The Republican Party has been engaged in
an image debate that has become increasingly
more public since Barack Obama's election.
Should the party stick to its "core values" or
potentially compromise to attract new voters?
Paul Green, director of the Roosevelt University
Institute for Politics, said ina profile of Chicago
Young Republicans in the Chicago Tribune on
Aug. 12, "Young people coming up aren't going
to be excited by a party that is against abortion,
stem cell research and gay rights."
This is absolutely true. The GOP can not and
will not become the party of "No," nor is itcur-
rently. But some members of the party seem
not to mind the label. You know the ones I talk
about - the ones who seemingly cheered Chi-
cago's Olympic loss and worsening unemploy-
ment figures on the same day, and the people
who want Obama to fail so they can capitalize
in 2010. This is not the way to curry favor with
the electorate.
To avoid that detrimental label, the party
needs to realize that people with moderate
views regarding health care, abortion, etc., are
still Republicans. These members should not
be cast aside or labeled as not "real" Republi-
cans - they should be embraced. These kinds
of Republicans offer the best shot at growing
the party and winning over independent Amer-
ica. And in a country where more people label
themselves as independents then Republicans
or Democrats, the independents hold the key to
Congress and the White House.
This drama recently played out on our cam-
pus, in our own Republican Party, and the out-
come saddened me. A chairman with moderate
views in regard to abortion, the death penalty,
gun control and gay marriage was forced out
of office because his views didn't represent
those of the group. When elected members are
removed from office because their views are
not in accord with "the norm," it is a cause for
concern. I worry about the future of my party
if this is the path we choose to take.
Matthew Schaible

Everyone is afraid of something - even that macho guy
who says he isn't (and it's usually something harmless like
bunnies). According to President Franklin Roosevelt, the
only thing we should fear is "fear itself." You've heard it
in school and from every adult you've ever known. Just
conquer your fear and you will be master of your own life,
blah blah blah. If you let fear run your life, you are just
giving in.
Just because most college students can recite this
advice like a Sunday school catechism doesn't mean that
we actually live it. Sure, we don't stay inside just because
we might fall and hit our heads outside - I'm talking
about sensible fear, not paranoia. But uncertainty about
the future is a different story.
I'm quickly approaching my 20th birthday. And though
I never thought of myself as Peter Pan, I find myself dread-
ing my birthday for the first time. Shedding my teenage
identity is quite possibly one of the scariest things I've
ever done. Responsibility and adulthood are staring me in
the face, and I'm not ready.
The weird thing about actually being in college is that
my path isn't already laid out for me. Throughout high
school, I was focused on graduating and getting into a
good college. For most people where I grew up, attend-
ing college wasn't even really a decision. It's just what
happened after high school. Even during high school, I
had very few real decisions to make about my education.
I took this math class and that English class and followed
the logical progression. Nowadays, my parents just look
at me blankly when I ask them what they think about my
proposed classes for next semester.
I tell people that I am a Political Science major as if
I've already declared, but I haven't. I feel like if I declare,
I'm accepting the responsibility to actually be an adult

some day. Like my reluctance to turn 20, the simple act of
declaring represents the inevitable march toward gradu-
ation and a real job.
I really don't know what I want to do with my life. Even
a little bit. I could be a lawyer or a politician. Maybe I
want to be a speechwriter, or I guess I could be a teacher.
Diplomacy has always sounded interesting. Public rela-
tions has been thrown on the table. To be honest, if my
theoretic table was real, it would probably take up more
space than Angell Hall.
To make matters worse, I'm surrounded by .examples
of people growing up. My best friend's sister has a job, a
house, health insurance and a cat. Patrick Zabawa, a for-
mer Daily coworker, now has a real job where he wears
dress clothes to work every day - except for casual Fri-
days - and has the power to fire people. My friends insist
on graduating and entering the real world with ridiculous
things like jobs and yearly salaries. This should make me
feel like I'm being left behind, but instead it just makes
me want to fight the inevitable pull out of Neverland into
adulthood.
And my advisor emailed me with a gentle reminder to
all sophomores that we should be thinking about declar-
ing a major soon. Great.
I have no idea where my life is going, and that's a scary
thought. But I can't let that fear stop me from actually
growing up. I don't really want to live with my parents
forever. One of these days, I'll have to actually get over
this fear and face my future. But for now, I guess I'll apply
to law school. And going to school for the rest of my life
isn't really an option. Theoretically, I want to have a job
and a family at some point.

For the Daily
Like so many gritty, Ray Ban-

pop bands before **
it, The Big Pink
has created quite The Big Pink
a buzz. Between A Brief
loudmouthed

like "Lily Allen is 4AD
a mouthy bitch"
(which was, in fact, a compliment)
and the band's sexually sugges-
tive name, it's hard to push all the
bullshit aside and take the edgy
London duo's music seriously.
It looks like The Big Pink's Rob-
bie Furze and Milo Cordell got the
memo, though. The loudmouth
tendencies that arguably made the
band famous have seemed to dis-
appear. For one, A Brief History of
Love's formerly X-rated album art-
work by Dennis Cooper has been
toned down. The new cover now
looks as though it could be found
in any hipster-haven record store:
it merely features an artsy photo of
a scantily clad woman placed under
the band's name.
Even though the duo's name
may pay homage to The Band's
twangy, homespun Music from
Big Pink, its musical influences
are much closer to the textured,
gloomy vocals of The Jesus and
Mary Chain circa Psychocandy.
Furze and Cordell, who produced
A BriefHistory ofLove themselves,
play into the semi-garbled to-fi
sound that seems to be dominating
indie rock right now, but they still
manage to make the tracks sound
fresh-and exciting.
The first single, "Velvet," is a
moody ballad, complete with muf-
fled electronic feedback that per-
meates the entire track. Produced
by Alan Moulder, who has previ-
ously worked with bands like My
Bo94yVaj tjpandThe Smahing
Pumpkins, the song has an experi-
mental quality that complements
Furze's soulful vocals. Through
streams of percussion and sound,
Furze's voice seems drowned out
by the music, creating a haunting
sonic backdrop.

"Crystal' Visions" and "Domi-
nos" are both layered with elec-
tronic synthesizers that explode
into intense guitar solos at their
choruses. In an album slightly
bogged down by slow, emotionally
laden tracks, these songs bring a
hard rock exterior that matches
the band's hip persona. "Dominos"
takes on the cruel nature of love
with pitiless lyrics like "Swallow
my sugar kiss and eat it alone"
and "I really loved breaking your
heart." The lyrics are twisted and
almost sadistic, aiming for the gut
and forgoing simple interpreta-
tion. These guys obviously have
some serious hang-ups and aren't
afraid to air their dirty laundry in
these songs.
Cordell, who also produced
electronic tunes for Klaxons,
Crystal Castles and The Teenag-
ers, has plenty of experience with
the electro-pop genre. His uncan-
ny ability to take synthetically dis-
torted "noise" and make it music is
on full display here. Still, while the
album's unpolished sound is both
innovative and appealing, at times
the listeners might feel like they're
sitting in on a musical experiment
A bit unpolished,
but still exciting.
rather than listening to a well-
composed album. In "Golden Pen-
dulum," a repetitive and grating
beat is juxtaposed with monotone
vocals, falling flat with its scat-
tered tinkerings.
A Brief History of Love is a pretty
hefty subject to take on in a debut
album, but The Big Pink proves
it's up to the challenge. Each track
sums up a unique aspect of love:
From the excitement of budding
romance ("Too Young to Love")
to painful, drawn-out breakups
("Love in Vain"), the London duo
touches all the bases. While A Brief
History of Love may at times feel
like a wonky experiment in elec-
tro music, its crooning vocals and
innovative sound make up for these
minute glitches.

archive footage, still images, voi-

cases his expertise in the medium.
Traditionally, Moore's films
have been sharp in their focus,
especially upon the object of his
criticism. While "Fahrenheit 9/11"
leveled specific accusations of
wrongdoing against clearly iden-
tified individuals, "Capitalism"
paints in broader strokes, naming
the abstract concept of capitalism,

States, as the chief villain of the

there is no hero.
Moore's stated desire is noble.
He wantstocorrect the American
economic system so that hard-
working Americans can reclaim
their lost jobs and rediscover
financial stability. However, he
refuses to name a potential politi-
cal alternative to big, bad capital-

ism. He expertly reveals the sins
and pitfalls of the system and why
the country must scrap it but stops
short ofnamingits successor.
By avoiding an endorsement of
anotherconcrete economicasystem,
Moore plays it far too safe. He has
never cared about political back-
lash in the past, so it is disappoint-
ing, even for staunch supporters of
the current American economic
structure, that Moore is not bold
enough to identify what he thinks
is a better plan for America.
"Capitalism: A Love Story"
tells a vivid yet horrifying tale of
economic stagnation and decline.
Michael Moore has once again
proven himself to be a masterful
storyteller whose skills at eliciting
an emotional response from his
audience areunmatched. Unfortu-
nately, after presenting the prob-
lem and establishing it as a threat
to the future of the nation, he fails
to identify a viable solution to the
disaster in which he insists we find
ourselves.

.Cox catches nobody

By CHRISTINA ANGER
For the Daily
Older men have always been
chasing younger women. Recently,
however, older
women, or "cou-
gars," have been
on the prowl for Cougar Town
studly young
men - and these
women are con- at9.30 .m.
fidently scouring ABC
the dating scene.
"Cougar Town" stars Courteney
Cox ("Friends") as Jules Cobb, a
40-something recent divorcee with
a teenage son. She is afraid of stag-
nant life and exasperated by the
prospect of looking for a new mate.
ABC's new series has the poten-
tial to be a sexy, funny sitcom for
singles and the hitched alike. It
arouses, perhaps, some competi-
tive interest in its younger female
viewers to get off the couch and
snag their male peers before a cou-
gar gets her paws on them. As fun
as the title's wordplay is, "Cougar
Town" is a half hour of forced sexu-
ality and unrelatable situations.
And, if it must be said, that's noth-
ing to howl at.
At one point, Courteney Cox
was a character on a little series
called "Friends." The show was,
for teens in the '90s, an important
part of learning how to grow up and
deal with those awkward sexual
moments that would'undoubtedly
play an integral part of viewers'
futures. As the world continued
turning, those teens became adults
and Cox got older (but still, she's as
gorgeous as ever).
Even so, "Cougar Town," pre-
mieres with Cobb in front of the
bathroom mirror staring in disgust
at her aging body. With maybe five
pounds of extra weight around her
middle, slightly flabby upper arms
and inner thighs that barely touch,
Jules delivers the show's first fail-
ure by her character's agonizing
over her mostly perfect physique.
As if it isn't annoying enough to
have a cougar with a body poten-
tially more fit than the young men
she hunts, there are the show's

excruciating sexual moments that
are so awkward they're just not
funny. From the idea of little boys
fantasizing over posters of Cobb to
her teenage son casually walking in
on her performing sexual favors on
a man half her age, the situations
are repellent. The scenes might've
been funny if they weren't lightly
shrugged off by Jules, followedby a
sigh of"oh, Mom" from a delusional
son. A teenage boy should wretch
at the mere thought of his mother's
sexual lifestyle, right?
Adding to the show's problems,
Cox acts as a ditzy, raging woman
who scorns the idea of her mid-
dle-aged male neighbor getting
with tons of college-aged girls. Of
course, the remedy to her repul-
sion comes in the form of a young
man, solidifying her status as a
cougar in the dating world. (He
isn't even attractive enough to
waste a short stare on.) Cox is too
over-the-top in her acting, and she
seems less like a cougar and more
like a promiscuous 20-something.
It doesn't help that she doesn't
look a day over 3.
The series is overly scripted,
stupidly sexual and holds no basis
for a thoughtful plot whatsoever.
overly scripted,
stupidly sexual.
This cougar isn't a sophisticated
woman who lures young men into
her lair with a wit too mature for
them to comprehend - now that
would've actually been interest-
ing. There's no sense of female
empowerment, which is a stance
the show should have taken, It
would be simple and fascinating to
play off the intimidation cougars
have the ability to possess.
"Cougar Town," if not doomed
to failwithinanolder women audi-
ence, isnsure to fall off the radar (if
it ever makes it on anyone's) with
a younger generation who couldn't
possibly push Monica Geller aside
for the shallow character that is
Jules Cobb.

could help keep the defense out

Moosman was very good at get-
ting his body'in front of defenders
quickly.
Whatever the problem, the
Wolverines need to figure out a
solution quickly. This Saturday,
they are traveling to a raucous
Kinnick Stadium to play Iowa,
which has one of the best defen-
sive lines in the nation.
"This will be maybe the biggest
challenge our guys have faced so
far this year, with the front seven
of Iowa," Rodriguez said during
yesterday's teleconference. "The
linebackers are very good, but.
their front four is outstanding."
The Hawkeyes blitz rarely and
only during critical periods, but
the front four is good enough to
get pressure on the quarterback
without extra help.
That will make things espe-
cially difficult for freshman quar-

terback Tate Forcier, because not
only will he have to avoid strong
pressure in the pocket, but he'll
have to pick apart as many as
seven Hawkeyes in coverage.
"When they don't beat them-
selves, they'll control the game,"
Rodriguez said of Iowa.
And up front, the Hawkeyes
excel at exactly what put the Wol-
verines on their heels last week -
jumping the ball.
"They're just very good up front
and very aggressive," Rodriguez
said. "They jump the ball well.
They get off the ball pretty quick.
So it's a good challenge certainly
for our guys. We'll have to play a
lot better than we did this past
weekend."
Of course, Molk's presence
would help bolster the line
against the toughest defense the
Wolverines will face all year. But
Rodriguez and Co. aren't making
excuses.
Instead, they will continue to
try to find a combination up front
that will click and a game plan
that will take down the vaunted
Hawkeyes.
"As coaches, we've got to get
them in some other players maybe
to help, and we just weren't sharp,"
Rodriguez said. "And when you
play a pretty solid team and you're
not sharp on the road, it's going to
cost you."

BY ZAKPYZIK
For the Daily
Michigan women's soccer head
coach Greg Ryan has more on the
line than usual this Sunday. The'
Wolverines head to East Lansing to
challenge No.20 Michigan State, and
Ryan's undefeated intrastate record
falls into the hands - or feet - of his
players.
Since 1999, the home teamhas not
lostagameintheMichigan-Michigan
State rivalry. The two teams ended
last year's match ina stalemate.
"Lyst yeer, we played on the road,
and I really didn't think that it had
much of an impact," Ryan said. "It's
close enough that a lot of Michigan
fans can get there. Last year, I did not
feel that it was an away game."
The team says being on the road
will not change the game plan, even
though Michigan has recently had
difficulty in away games, the Wol-
verines will visit the Spartans with a
1-5 road record.In hopes of reversing
this trend, Michigan will have to shut
down two game-changing Spartans.
Michigan State senior forward
Lauren Hill and sophomore forward
Laura Heyboer are a threatening duo
who have accumulated seven assists
and 15 goals for the fast-paced Spar-
tan offense.
"We can't defend them individu-
ally," Ryan said. "It's goingto take our
whole backline to try and keep them
quiet."
But even if the Spartans appear
to have the advantage, they will still
have to finda way to control Wolver-
ine junior Amanda Bowery.
Bowery, who plays both defense

and forward, is the only current
Michigan player who has scored in
thelast425minutesofplay-andshe
did ittwice.
The Wolverines will have to click
offensivelyquicklyinordertocounter
Michigan State's aggressive offense.
Freshman forward Holly Hein,
who netted game-winning goals
against Miami and Oakland, will
have a big role in trying to get Michi-
gan's offense to click. As a young
player going into hostile rival terri-
tory, it willbe a difficult task.
"I'm just excited to play in a big
rivalry game," Hein said. "We have
been playingreally well, we just need
to go out there and playthe same that
we would, anywhere, any day. We
need to build the attack and get the
numbers up."
Michigan's offense will have to
unify on the field to compete. In the
lastthreegames,theWolverineshave
struggled to outscore their opponents
by morethan one point. The teamhas
scored more goals on set plays than
they have the run of play.
"Our offense needs to connect on
our passes, and we have to make sure
that our final ball is good," Bowery
said.
"Sometimes we get nervous and
just kick the ball away,but we need to
make sure that we are composed."
Though the Spartans are favored,
the Wolverines have had unexpected
success in this role this season. Mich-
igan defeated No. 21 Miami 1-0 and
lost a one goal contest against No. 17
Southern Cal.
"This is nothing new to us," Ryan
said. "We are used to playing as the
underdog."

Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson has made it clear that
junior backup goalie Shawn Hun-
wick is a "relief pitcher" this sea-
Like most relief pitchers, Hun-
wick wasn't told when he was
going to get into
the game in NOTEBOOK
Michigan's final
exhibition game against Wind-
sor. When he took over for junior
Bryan Hogan in the second period,
Sunday, it was his first appearance
since his freshman year.
"I knew before the game I was
going to get in at some point, but
I thought it would be later in the
game," Hunwick said. "Obviously
I was a little bit nervous. I wanted
to prove to the coaches and the
teammates what I could do for the
team. (The nerves) got out of there
pretty quick once I made my first
save."
'Hunwick's teammates didn't
give him the smoothest start.
Just four minutes after Hunwick
entered the game, an intercepted
pass led to a two-man break for
Windsor. Hunwick got a piece of
the ensuing one-timer, but eventu-
ally the puck got past him. After
another quick goal by the visi-
tors, Michigan found itself down
2-1 midway through the game to
a team it beat 12-1 in its previous
meeting.
Hunwick shut Windsor down
the rest of the way, making nine
saves in 40 minutes en route to his
first career win.
"He fought it in the beginning,"
Berenson said. "He got it together
and by the end of the game, I think
he was feeling back in his groove.

After last season, when there
was uncertainty between the
pipes, Berenson has made it clear
that Hogan, who eventually won
the job last year, is his number
one goalie. Berenson also said he
doesn't know when or if Hunwick
will play again this season.
NEW GAME, NEW LINES: After
puttingsophomoreforward Robbie
Czarnik on the first line with Louie
Caporusso and David Wohlberg in
the season's two exhibition games,
junior Ben Winnett will step into
that role when the Wolverines
head to Alaska this weekend.
Winnett put up two assists on
the opening weekend, but he fig-
ures to be more of a role player

when playing with offensively tal-
ented players such as Wohlberg
and Caporusso.
"I think (Winnett will) be a
good complement on that line,"
Berenson said. "He'll make good,
subtle, plays and I think he's got
better offense than hisnumbers
have shown."
Freshman Chris Brown will
remain at right wing for the sec-
ond line, playing with juniors Carl
Hagelin and Matt Rust. Czarnik
will drop down to the third line
to play with freshman A.J. Treais
and senior Ben Lebler.
"(The lines) might last a game,
or a period, or a week or two,"
Berenson said. "Right now we're
just trying to put players together

and see who's playing well and
isn't, and what they could add,
and try to -get some experienced
players with freshman players."
NOTES: Michigan's two games
up in Alaska this weekend are
exempt from the maximum 34
games they are allowed to play.
This encourages more teams to
travel to Alaska. Michigan will
actually play 37 games this year,
with the outdoor game in Wiscon-
sin also exempt, the exemptions....
The only player on the roster not to
play in at least one of the preseason
games was third-string freshman
goalie Patrick Summers. ... A.J.
Treais was the only one of the six
freshmen to score a goal on open-
ing weekend.

some athletic department employ-
ees in charge of facilities came from
the Rec Sports department, so they
understand how helpful access to
top-notch facilities can be for club
or even intramural athletes.
But the exchange between.var-
sity and club sports doesn't stop at
equipment - there are sometimes
player tradeoffs, too.
"I wouldn't say it's common, but
it's certainly not uncommon," Jen-
dryka said. "We've had a fair num-
ber of varsity athletes drop down
just because they don't have the
time to dedicate. They can't do that
many hours outside the classroom,
the travel, the expectations."
And it also works the other way.
Jendryka said she has received
phone calls and rushed c-mails
from club presidents who have
to send her new contact informa-
tion for their teams because some
their players have made the varsity
squad.
One of the best examples of the
club-to-varsity bond is the men's

soccer program. Each season,
Burns, the men's varsity coach,
attends club tryouts to scout out
the talent level on campus. Often,
he'll invite a player or two to try out
for varsity, and he will sometimes
have some of the top club athletes
train with the varsity squad all
winter in preparation for preseason
tryouts. The club and varsity teams
also square off every spring in an
exhibition game, giving Burns yet
another chance to recruit.
But the relationship between
varsity and club teams in the same,
sport isn't always smooth. For the
women's club hockey team, it's a
challenge to earn respect while
playing in the same arena as the
men's varsity hockey team. Part of
the problem could be that men's
coach Red Berenson has never been
a vocal proponent of the women's
club program.
"I don't get a sense that there's
any active engagement, and I don't
get a sense that there's any active
disapproval," said Susan McDow-
ell, long-time staff advisor for the
women's club team. "I don't think
we matter, and I don't mean that
meanly. I just think his primary
focus is on the success of his men's
varsity program. ... It's not the

world's most perfect situation, but
I think that's where it is."
THE PAYOFF OF CLUB
ATHLETICS
Along the way, though, some-
thing happens to a team as it bat-
tles for respect on the field and in
the Michigan Athletic Department:
teammates bond, leaders emerge
and individuals learn to reap the
most from a difficult system.
Paruk, the women's Ultimate
Frisbee captain, described the chal-
lenge of scheduling classes around
practice during the school year and
planningvacations around summer
tournaments. But her eyes lit up
most as she spoke of the relation-
ships she has formed with other
players on the team.
Players from each competitive
club team, from women's hockey to
men's rowing, spoke of the close-
knit ties between members of their
programs. From fundraising to
recruiting, the added obstacles club
teams face give them an "us against
the world" mentality.
"I think some of those struggles
make the successes even sweeter,"
Jendryka said.

Rivalry in close
quarters
How dorm hall camaraderie
fuels competition
For many University students,
the residence hall is simply a place
to make a few close friends and
poignant memories..
But once in a while, a floor takes
dorm-hall camaraderie to a differ-
ent level.
in 2004, for instance, the resi-
dents in Markley's Fifth Scott
house decided to become the Fifth
Scott Pirates. They made it offi-
cial with a Facebook group and
T-shirts.
But with a legacy of rivalry
inherent to being a Michigan Wol-
verine, higher-than-average dorm
hall solidarity can't exist for long
without a challenge from another
group.
Every year, on the night of the
first substantial snowfall, West
Quad and South Quad battle each
other in a snowball fight. But at
other times, dorm hall rivalries
develop more spontaneously.-
Michael Fromm, a sophomore at
Michigan in 1982, can recall a fre-
quent "late night game of chicken"
between people who lived in Alice
Lloyd and Masher-Jordan. Fromm
wrote in an e-mail that "students
who lived on the MoJo and Alice
Lloyd wings that faced each other
would alternate screaming 'MoJo

sucks' and 'Alice Lloyd sucks."
The only real objective was to see
who could get the loudest.
"It always began (the) same way
with one room on each side, but
of course it never ended there,"
Fromm wrote. "And the sound
was impossible to ignore, so as the
game wore on and the competitive
juices started to flow, students from
across both dorms would flood the
rooms on these wings in a show of
solidarity. My recollection is that
the empty space between the two
dorms made the sound resonate
like it was coming over the PA sys-
tem at The Big House."
In South Quad this year, there
is an intense rivalry between the
two honors houses, Taylor and
Hunt. Living in South Quad means
competing with your floor house in
the South Quad Olympics and per-
haps some group activities. But if
you live in Taylor or Hunt, it's a bit
more serious.
It started with an alcohol and
drug free rave hosted by Hunt
House that sparked a competition
over which house was more fun,
said LSA freshman Josh Buoy, a
Hunt resident.
"That was kind of the first time
that Hunt would be the dominant
house," Buoy said..
Another Hunt resident,aLSA
freshman Mike Zerbib, added:
"And Taylor was really, really jeal-
ous."
Since then, Hunt and Taylor res-
idents have paid attention to any

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OBSERVES
NATIONAL HAZING PREVENTION WEEK
OCTOBER 8TH-16TH
Remember the victims of hazing on the Diag tomorrow, October 8, 2009
Did you know...
Hazing occurs in, but extends beyond, varsity athletics and Greek-letter
organizations; 55% of college students involved in clubs, teams, and athletic
organizations experience hazing*
In 95% of the cases where students identified their experience as hazing, they did
not report the events to campus officials*
Nine out of ten students who have experienced hazing behavior in college do not
consider themselves having been hazed*
A person cannot consent to be hazed

QUOTES OF THE WEEK

Four years this month.
It's very painful. They're
still not sure what's
causing it."
- JAIME MOLISEE, a woman from Jack-
sonville, Fla., describing her "debilitating
and relentless" hiccups that have lasted
for four years. No medication has helped

"They stabbed people
with bayonets. They raped
women with guns. This
is a savagery that can't be
explained."
- THIERNO MAADJOU SOW, a doctor with the
Guinean Organization for Human Rights, describing
the violence perpetrated by Guinean government
troops against people protesting the junta leader

Among the slew of prob-
lems associated with
gender dynamics and
male chauvinism, we can now
add birth control to the list.
Due to the advent of sexually
transmitted infections like
HIV/AIDS, huge public health
measures over the last decade
have increased awareness on
serious concerns for everyone
who has sex. Out of this debate
has risen the increased need for
more technologically advanced
methods of contraception. This
initially took the form of the
condom and the diaphragm.
Next, there was the arrival of
hormonal methods of birth
control, namely, "the pill."
But while the diaphragm and
the condom present equal mea-
sures for women and men to
retain control of reproduction,
the pill is a one-sided alterna-
tive. Women are expected to
take on the responsibility of
an everyday pill that could
cause an array of negative side
effects. WebMD lists nausea,
weight gain, sore breasts and
mood changes as less serious
side effects. Among the more
serious are high blood pressure,
stroke, blood clots, headaches
and eye problems like blurred
vision. While these symptoms
in their most extreme form
do not affect everyone, most
women experience some side
effects. And the pill comes in
so many varieties that women
have to try each one for a mini-
mum period of three months
before it can be conclusively
determined that the nega-
tive effects will not subside.
A woman could go through a
seemingly endless time period
as her own guinea pig - hav-
ing to subject herself to various

pills, their side effects and a
hampered lifestyle. It is a rath-
er bleak picture.
Not to say that women
shouldn't use oral birth con-
trol. The ability to control
reproduction is invaluable,
but that power and responsi-
bility shouldn't rest solely in
women's hands. And thanks
to progress in modern science,
it doesn't have to. Male oral
contraceptive has been suc-
cessfully tested in humans and
could easily become an option
for men who would like to con-
trol whether their genes are
reproduced. In a 2009 Chinese
study, it was shown that testos-
terone based male contracep-
tive could "provide effective,
reversible, acceptable, and
readily delivered contracep-
tion for most healthy Chinese
men without serious short-
term adverse effects." Having
been researched for decades,
the technology for male oral
contraception is on the verge of
becoming a marketable reality.
The medical community had
even begun to consider regula-
tions for licensing and distrib-
uting such a drug, according to
Eberhard Nieschlag, a profes-
sor at the Institute of Repro-_
ductive Medicine in Germany.
But then the push for male oral
contraceptive was robbed
of momentum. Nieschlag
explains the shift in his article,
"Male Hormonal Contracep-
tive; Love's Labour's Lost?":
"However, these hopes were
suddenly intercepted when the
two companies (developing the
drug) were bought up by larger
players in the field who nei-
ther realized the potential of a
male contraceptive nor felt any
responsibility to develop it."

case involving extortion, in which someone demanded $2 million to keep quiet about his sex life

Sam Wolson Daily

Why is it that the fervor of
the pharmaceutical industry
has been levied behind the
female oral contraceptive but
not a male counterpart? Like
any business decision, it must
have come down to money. If
pharmaceutical companies
don't believe that enough men
would go in for a daily oral pill
to make the drug profitable,
then they aren't likely to mar-
ket it even if it would mean a
huge step forward for individ-
ual reproductive self-control.
While pharmaceutical compa-
nies rarely make statements
about research and develop-
ment decisions, Nieschlag
speculates that is due in part
to a lack of advocacy groups
calling for the drug as women's,
health advocates had done for
female hormonal contracep-
tive.But even though there isn't
a united voice expressing inter-

wouldn't be opposed to trying

Club sport athletes don't do t merely for the exercise. Many practice and
compete almost on the level of varsity, but without the funding and resources.
BY NICOLE AUERBACH I DAILY SPORTS EDITOR

elics of past glory line the wall on the sec-
ond floor of the Coliseum. Faded photo-
graphs of boxers in shiny maize shorts are
propped up on the counter. A newspaper article
on Shamael Haque, one of Michigan's most cel-
ebratedboxers, hangs next to the team photos in
a sturdy frame. Dust is starting to build up, but
no one wants to move the memories.
It's rather quiet, except for the beat of the
music - from a CD mix entitled "boxing hard-
core." The red, blue and white ropes lining the
boxing ring and the seven punching bags are
still, but not for long.
A rush of energy bursts into the room as
nearly 20 women enter, drenched in sweat from
a pre-practice jog. They are tall, short, white,
black and Latina. They are freshmen, seniors
and even University staff members. And every
single one of them is ready to wind up and punch
the stress-absorbing bags for two hours or until
their arms give out - whichever comes first.
This is the world of mismatched T-shirt uni-
forms and sharing equipment with the men's
team. This is the world of women's club boxing.
Club sports occupy an interesting niche on
campus. While some club programs, like wom-
en's boxing and martial arts clubs, emphasize
instruction and weekly exercise, certain teams
are as competitive as almost any varsity team.
The 42 clubs registered with the Recreational
Sports department include everything from
obscure groups like the rifle team to varsity sib-
ling sports like baseball. The time commitments

vary, but for some club athletes, practices and
games exceed more than 20 hours a week.
Members of club teams compete without
the perks afforded varsity teams: scholarships,
brand new gear and a page on the official Michi-
gan athletic site, mgoblue.com. They sacrifice
their time, energy and grade point averages sim-
ply for the love of the game.
Still, there's a dream that many club team
presidents have. It's the rags-to-riches, club-
to-varsity Hollywood tale set against dramatic
music, like the kind in "Rocky."
In fact, five club sports - men's and women's
lacrosse, men's rowing, women's synchronized
skating and women's synchronized swimming
- have the classification of "club varsity," a title
Athletic Director Bill Martin created in 2000 to
put ultra-competitive club teams on the track
toward varsity standing.
The path to varsity status is riddled with
intense requirements, funding considerations
and legal constraints - meaning the Universi-
ty's strongest club teams have to maintain that
strength through mainly the will of their mem-
bers alone.
Men's Ultimate Frisbee captain Ollie Hondred
was the first club sport member to use the word
"cult" to describe his team. But his counterpart
on the women's team agreed.

"Ultimate Frisbee can be described as some
sort of cult," said Anna Maria Paruk, captain
of the women's Ultimate Frisbee club. "At least
for me, this isn't just a sport. It can be described
almost as a way of life."
It's not surprising that club athletes would
describe their teams that way - while fiercely
competing to snag the best-non-varsity athletes
on campus, club teams like Ultimate Frisbee rely
on the dedication of their members to survive.
Unlike varsity sports with extensive recruit-
ment budgets that include cross-country visits,
club sports depend on word of mouth and their
Festifall tables to attract new talent. Among the
many lost freshmen and people looking to boost
their resumes at Festifall are former high school
athletes looking to keep sports in their day-to-
day lives.
"It's an opportunity for people who might not
want to - or can't- take the sport they've always
known and loved to the next level," said Cheryl
Jendryka, Recreational Sports Assistant Direc-
tor, who works with all club teams. "But they
still want to be an athlete or they still want to go
around all day and chase something on a field,
whether that's a soccer ball or a Frisbee. Same
thing with rugby or boxing - you find these new
sports this way."
At the men's Ulti-
mate Frisbee tryouts
in September, dozens
of freshmen showed up i
with Frisbees in hand.,

As upperclassmen players tagged the recruits'
calves with Sharpie to distinguish them on the
field, the aspiring members shared their reasons
for coming. Some had been high school soccer
players who knew they couldn't compete at the
Division-I varsity level and always enjoyed an
afternoon Frisbee toss.
Hondred said his best recruiting tool is to find
the guys who didn't make the men's club soccer
team, which is lower than varsity soccer but still
competes on a very high level. Some members of
both the women's and men's club soccer teams,
for example, turned down the opportunity to
play soccer at smaller Division-III programs to
attend the University.
Turning down varsity offers elsewhere and
deciding to pay to play at Michigan is most evi-
dent in the world of club varsity athletics.
In 2000, after he was newly hired as athletic
director, Bill Martin created the club varsity
classification to go along with the existing appli-
cation for attaining varsity status. Before teams
earn the club varsity distinction, they are evalu-

ated on a number of topics, from the existence
of a national governing body to the amount of
hours spent practicing each week. Clubs that
have been established for more than eight years
are eligible to apply for the club varsity label.
Benefits of the new status include prior-
ity in scheduling practice locations/times and
opportunities for sponsored gear and warmup
suit packages.
The men's lacrosse team has garnered a
great deal of attention on its quest for varsity
status. Boastinga 40-game winningstreak, the
team's two flawless seasons have led to nation-
al championships in 2008 and 2009.
But the men's lacrosse team isn't the only
one making the most of the "varsity" part of
club varsity.
The men's rowing team has also won two
straight national championships, the first two
hosted by the newly formed America Collegiate
Rowing Association.
The two teams share more similarities with
the University's varsity teams beyond the level
of competition they face and the rigorous work-
out regimens (often including two-a-day prac-
tices) they undergo.
Both men's lacrosse and men's rowing have
representatives on the Student Athlete Advisory
Committee, which includes members from all
varsity programs.
But perhaps the most visible sign of growth
for both men's lacrosse and men's rowing was
their inclusion in Mock Rock, the athletic
department's annual fundraiser for C.S. Mott's
Children Hospital.
One major difference from varsity sports is
that club varsity sports require upperclassmen
to act as coaches, captains and star players all at
once. :
"You're entirely on your own, and that's the
difference (from) the varsity sports," Jendryka
said. "Not only are the club athletes trying to
get the best athletes and practicing, but some of

them are going to practice, then coming home the team's rise to varsity status. He had to write
and writing the lineup for the game the next multiple proposals to the Athletic Department,

was the driving print for teams aspiring to varsity status, such
force behind as increasingly popular sports like lacrosse and

women's ice hockey. And for a team like men's
rowing, which competes against varsity pro-
grams all season but is excluded from the sport's
traditional national championship, the fight for
the varsity distinction is more critical.
"We don'treallyneed allthestuff(the Adidas-
sponsored gear) that the varsity teams have,"
Zoufaly said. "It's all nice and everyone likes it,
but we just want the status to compete."
But forclub varsity teams, droppingthe "club"
can be difficult.
Following the procedure that the men's soc-
cer club program used, teams start the process
by submitting a formal request to a planning
committee ofthe University'sAdvisoryBoard on
Intercollegiate Athletics. The committee looks at
four main categories when making its decision:
student-athlete welfare, quality of competition
at the conference and national level, viability of
anew sport and financial considerations.
While the first three categories are signifi-
cant, most competitive club teams have those
bases covered. Men's rowing and men's lacrosse
both compete against the nation's top varsity
programs, and women's hockey has grown sig-
nificantly at the high school level in the state
of Michigan in just the past five years - just to
name a few examples.
But really, the struggle to advance to varsity
is all about financing. Suddenly, coaches must
be paid salaries. State-of-the-art equipment is
a must. Resources must be dedicated to nation-
wide recruitment, and the cost of travel makes
financial figures skyrocket.
"I would love to have more varsity sports,"
Martintold The Michigan Daily in 2007. "It's not
a matter of wanting to have new teams or not.
It's a matter of if you can afford them or not."
But men's lacrosse - or men's rowing -
doesn't have a chance of making varsity unless
there is a women's team to rise up with it.
Women's club hockey is a team that would
clearly benefit from increased financial support
- three practices a week and weekend games
bring the team's ice bill up to around $18,000 a
year.
The Athletic Department denied varsity sta-
tus to women's hockey when it applied to move
See PAGE 8B

Men's Ultimate Frisbee requires star players to double as coaches and recruiters to keep the team going year to year.

Women's club hockey can't afford to pay for ice time in order to practice as much as the club varsity level requires. And the Athletic Department can't afford to r

em varsity. Women's club boxing attracts dedicated amateur boxers who are looking for exercise and instruction ina new sport.
