ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Karan Higdon and Chris 

Evans might as well have been 
competing with each other.

After all, when a team comes 

nine yards shy of boasting 
two 200-yard rushers for the 
first time in program history, 
that’s usually how it goes.

And such was the story for 

the Wolverines. They ran the 
ball. They ran the ball. Then 
they ran the ball again.

In 
the 
end, 
Michigan’s 

ground game exploded to the 
tune of 371 yards — helping the 
Wolverines 
claim 
a 

33-10 victory over 
Minnesota (1-5 Big 
Ten, 
4-5 
overall) 

and 
maintain 

possession 
of 
the 

Little Brown Jug.

“We’ve just been 

really focusing on 
the run game and 

knew, again, that we were 
going to have to run the ball 
to win,” said senior left tackle 
Mason Cole. “We have the 
backs to do it, and we blocked 
well enough to get them 
through the line of scrimmage 
and onto the second level. 
From there it was all those 
guys.” 

Higdon struck first on the 

second drive of the game.

The 
Wolverines’ 
junior 

running back got the ball on 

2nd-and-10, 

found 
the 
hole 

that 

Michigan’s 
offensive 
line 

seems to be opening more 
with each passing week and 
charged 77 yards untouched 
to the end zone — the longest 
rush by a Wolverine since 
Denard Robinson ran for a 
79-yard touchdown against 
Air Force in 2012.

One 
offensive 
series 

passed the Wolverines (4-2, 
7-2) 
by. 
Then 
Evans 

followed 
suit.

On 
1st-and-10 

from 
Michigan’s 

own 
40-yard 

line, 
the 
sophomore 
running 

back did it 

all himself — breaking tackles 
at the line of scrimmage 
before cutting outside and 
streaking down the right hash 
marks for Michigan’s third 
touchdown of the game.

And so went the game of 

back and forth.

Higdon punched in a five-

yard touchdown with just 
over three minutes left in 
the third quarter to cap off a 
46-yard drive.

Evans broke another run 

to the outside and took it 67 
yards to the house on the next 
series to put the Wolverines 
up, 33-7.

“I looked up at one point 

and 
the 
statistics 
looked 

like we were Air Force,” 
said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “… I’ve never seen 
that many plus-50 yard runs 
in one game, any team I’ve 
ever coached or been on. That 
was quite the performance.” 

That it was. And it made 

Brandon Peters’ job easy. 
In his first collegiate start, 
the redshirt freshman was 
asked to throw just 13 

times. He completed 

A local animal rights group 

launched a change.org petition 
yesterday protesting the Ann 
Arbor City Council’s decision 
to continue Ann Arbor’s lethal 
deer 
management 
program. 

The 
petition 
reached 
360 

supporters 
as 
of 
Sunday 

evening.

The petition, which was 

started by the Friends of 
Ann 
Arbor 
Wildlife 
and 

Nature, argues City Council 
mismanaged municipal funds 
to support a program that, in 
FAAWN’s 
perspective, 
was 

unnecessarily cruel and had 
limited success in controlling 
Ann Arbor’s deer population.

“Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

want to know that their tax 
dollars are being put towards 
programs that have their best 
interests at heart,” the petition 
reads. “For this reason, we are 
petitioning the City of Ann 
Arbor to stop the killing of 350 
deer this Winter and look to 
non-lethal options to manage 
the deer population.”

Each week, The Michigan 

Daily will be publishing a 
wrap-up of the most important 
bills 
proposed 
in 
Michigan 

Legislature over the past seven 
days:

This past week, Michigan 

legislators have been busy 
debating 
auto 
insurance 

reform. On Thursday evening, 
HB 5013, which would have 
reduced insurance premiums, 
was defeated in the House 
of 
Representatives 
by 
an 

overwhelming 
majority 

of 
Democrats 
and 
some 

Republicans, 45-63.

The bill would have allowed 

drivers to choose between 
$250,000, 
$500,000 
and 

unlimited lifetime coverage 
for medical expenses resulting 
from 
auto 
crashes. 
Under 

current law, Michigan is the 
only state with such that 
mandates unlimited coverage.

The Office of Diversity, 

Equity 
and 
Inclusion 

announced 
the 
University 

of Michigan will conduct a 
survey evaluating the topics 
of 
diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion within its campus. 
The 
survey 
will 
question 

5,000 
librarians, 
curators, 

postdoctoral 
fellows 
and 

house officers at Michigan 
Medicine and others places.

To 
maintain 

confidentiality, the 15-minute 
web-based survey will be 
conducted by an independent 
Ann Arbor research firm 
SoundRocket. 
The 
survey 

was announced just prior to a 
second DEI survey that went 

out to all students.

The 
DEI 
Office 
has 

conducted 
several 
similar 

climate 
surveys 
over 
the 

past year. Previous campus 
climate surveys were sent 
to a total audience of 8,500 
people, with questions that 
were tailored to staff and 
students finding 72 percent 
of the campus community 
is satisfied with the current 
campus climate. 

In an email interview with 

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen, she said 
ADVANCE, a U-M specific 
survey and research resource, 
did not survey the nearly 
5,000 faculty members — 
librarians, 
archivists 
and 

postdoctoral fellows — that 
are included in the most 
recent survey.

IASA performance celebrates 
philanthropy, blending cultures

Annual show showcased culture across India through several dance numbers

The 
Indian 
American 

Student Association gathered 
Friday on the stage of a 
crowded Hill Auditorium to 
present its annual cultural 
show, showcasing the diversity 

of dance, music and language 
that can be found across India.

The show, titled “Sarani: The 

Allure of Adventure,” took the 
audience on a tour on different 
parts 
of 
Indian 
cultures. 

While exploring the history of 
India through song and dance 
performances, IASA weaved 
American 
cultural 
elements 

into the show and explored the 
significance of being Indian-
American.

The show is the biggest 

student-run cultural show in 
North America, with audiences 
of 3,200 to 4,000 typically 
gathering each year, according 
to show coordinator Ashwin 
Johri, an Engineering senior. 

IASA, 
the 
second-largest 

active 
group 
on 
campus, 

has brought together Indian 
American students for the past 
34 years to perform in shows, 
participate 
in 
community 

service and discuss the larger 
social, political and economic 
matters affecting India today.

they couldn’t make money with 
the reduced rates.

Democrats 
would 
like 

to address the nondriving-
related 
factors, 
including 

zip codes, credit scores and 
education attainment, which 
disproportionately 
affect 

urban drivers. House Minority 
Leader Sam Singh, D-East 
Lansing, voted no on the 
legislation, along with 41 other 
Democrats.

“We have a plan that brings 

down costs and doesn’t force 
people into bankruptcy,” Singh 
told the Free Press. “I am 
committed to coming back next 
week and taking a look at the 
bills that are still in committee 
and making sure they get a fair 
hearing.”

HB 5207 – 5214: This set 

of bills addresses elections, 
including 
ballots 
and 

petitions, through amending 
the repealing parts of the 

Michigan Election Law, act 116 
of 1954.

The bills address several 

aspects 
of 
petitioning, 

including allowing the removal 
of a name and signature from 
a ballot question or recall 
question, 
banning 
anyone 

that has been convicted of an 
election crime from collecting 
petition 
signatures 
and 

requiring petition circulators 
be paid per hour and not on 
commission.

The bills were put forth by 

Robert Kosowski, D-Westland, 
following 
another 
election 

bill from the Senate being 
approved in the House earlier 
this week. The bill, HB 5012, 
make election recounts much 
more expensive for those that 
request them.

Jim Lilly, R-Park Township, 

proposed the bill, which was 
prompted 
by 
the 
recount 

requested by Jill Stein, Green 
Party presidential candidate 
during the 2016 presidential 
election.

“Jill Stein exploited our state 

laws to force a recount, even 
though she lost by more than 
2 million votes,” Lilly said in a 
press release. “My legislation 
eliminates 
the 
ambiguity 

in the law that allowed her 
recount charade to temporarily 
obstruct the election process 
and cause an expensive legal 
battle.”

Under this bill, recounts 

would 
cost 
double 
for 

candidates who have little 
to no chance of winning. In 
the 2016 election, Stein only 
received 1 percent of all the 
votes casted in Michigan.

HB 5203 – 5206: These bills 

would make it more difficult to 
prosecute juveniles for certain 
sex crimes, through amending 
the Michigan Penal Code, act 
328 of 1931.

Robert 
Kosowski, 

D-Westland, proposed the bill 
that will change the age that 
someone can be charged for 
prostitution 
to 
18-years-old 

from 16-years-old.

The bills come on the heels 

of news of several Federal 

Bureau of Investigation 
stings 
in 
Michigan 
to 

arrest 
suspected 
pimps 

and rescue sex-trafficked 
juveniles, 
including 
in 

mid-October, August and 
November of last year.

HB 
5184: 
This 
bill 

would raise the fine for 
a false report to police 
from $2,000 to $4,000, not 
amending the possibility of 
four years of imprisonment 
in addition to the fine.

Kosowski, proposed the 

bill earlier last week. This 
past year, at the University 
of Michigan and in the 
surrounding areas, there 
have been numerous false 
reports made to police.

Most recently, the Ann 

Arbor Police Department 
declared an armed robbery 
near campus to be false 
in early September. Last 
December, the AAPD said 
an alleged hate crime in 
which a man told a woman 
to take off her hijab or he 
would light her on fire, did 
not occur.

WRAP-UP
From Page 1A


“This is the University’s 

way of making sure everyone 
on our campus has a chance 
to participate in the survey,” 
Broekhuizen said. “The results 
of the census survey offer 
individual 
schools, 
colleges 

and other units on campus 
findings unique to those units.”

Broekhuizen also said both 

surveys released are about 
the campus climate related to 
diversity, equity and inclusion; 
however, some questions may 
differ. 
The 
questions 
were 

written by the Office of DEI, 
campus community and survey 
research experts as well as 
other 
community 
advisory 

committees, according to the 
press release.

The DEI Office put forth a 

five-year strategy last year. 
According to the DEI’s online 
plan, its strategy to expand 
University 
diversity 
and 

inclusivity is three-pronged. 
The first strategy is to “Create 
an Inclusive and Equitable 
Campus Climate,” second is to 
“Recruit, Retain and Develop a 
Diverse Community” and the 
third and final is to “Support 
Innovative 
and 
Inclusive 

Scholarship 
and 
Teaching.” 

The press release on the DEI 
survey states its goal is to 
gather data and statistics as it 
relates to the campus climate 
on 
diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion.

In an interview with The 

Daily, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel discussed the 
progress of the DEI plan and 
his feelings on current campus 
climate. He articulated his 
excitement regarding a few 
of the upcoming initiatives 
in relation to diversity and 
inclusion, such as Wolverine 
Pathways, which works with 
secondary-school 
students 

in 
Detroit, 
Ypsilanti 
and 

Southfield, 
and 
provides 
a 

path to University admission 
and a scholarship — as well as 
the Go Blue Guarantee, which 
allows any in-state students 
whose households earn below 
$65,000 to have their tuition 
completely 
covered 
by 
the 

University.

“I think the initiative is off 

to a good start,” said University 
President Mark Schlissel in the 
interview. “But there’s a huge 
amount of work to be done and 
there are some things that are 

immediate and short term, and 
there are other things that we 
start now and we are going to 
have to be continued for a long 
time.”

Schlissel 
referenced 

postdoctoral faculty members 
in his interview, one of the 
targets of the DEI survey. He 
mentioned the effectiveness 
of 
the 
LSA 
postdoctorate 

program, 
potential 
faculty 

members who have completed 
their Ph.D.s but are not yet ready 
for an independent position, 
and its diversity plan. The 
LSA postdoctorate fellowship 
sets aside postdoctoral slots 
for those who study diversity 
and for those who create a 
more diverse and equitable 
community.

In 
an 
April 
2017 
press 

release, 
the 
University 

announced the creation of the 
LSA Collegiate Postdoctoral 
Fellowship Program. As part 
of the DEI’s five-year strategic 
plan, the LCPFP looks to 
promote faculty and research 
diversity 
throughout 
the 

institution.

“We 
have 
made 
a 

commitment 
to 
ensure 
a 

scholarly 
environment 
that 

will meet the needs of our 
diverse community,” said LSA 
Dean Andrew D. Martin in 
the press release. “Through 
LCPFP, we hope to recruit 
outstanding individuals that 
will view LSA as an academic 
home and who will positively 
impact the very culture and 
structure of our university, 
college and individual units.”

The 
survey 
targets 
the 

greater postdoctorate program 
as well as consists of nearly 
1,500 current postdoctorates 
distributed 
among 
the 
21 

separate 
schools, 
colleges, 

institutes and 155 departments, 
according to Matt Nelson, the 
director of communications of 
Rackham Graduate School.

“We 
at 
Rackham, 
who 

support 
postdoc 
fellows 

and oversee the quality of 
postdoctoral training across 
the university, wholly embrace 
a commitment to enhancing 
diversity,” Nelson said.

Chief 
diversity 
officer 

Robert Sellers, and vice provost 
for equity and inclusion, will 
oversee this survey and has 
overseen similar DEI surveys

The survey will stay open 

until Dec. 8 and the results will 
be released by spring 2018.

The organization is involved 

in 
various 
philanthropies 

and 
events, 
but 
for 
IASA 

co-president Bavica Gummadi, 
an LSA senior, IASA’s impact 
culminates at this cultural 
show.

“I think the biggest message 

that I want everyone to take 
away from our show is the 
passion 
that 
our 
dancers 

bring and the passion that our 
membership brings,” Gummadi 
said. “It’s almost unreal that 
every single member has the 
level of passion, energy and 
enthusiasm 
that 
they 
do, 

and that’s what keeps our 
organization running at 150 
percent.”

Each year, the show’s title in 

based on a word from Sanskrit, 
an ancient Indian language 
from 
which 
many 
modern 

Indian languages are derived. 
This year’s word, “Sarani” is 
the Sanskrit word for “path.” 
Johri 
believes 
this 
word 

perfectly reflects the goal of 
the show.

“It’s kind of symbolic of our 

path that we’re taking through 
India, as we tour through the 
different 
places, 
highlight 

the 
different 
subcultures 

and 
watch 
these 
amazing 

performances,” he said.

Standing under beams of 

orange, 
white 
and 
green, 

colors of the Indian flag, a total 
of 240 dancers took the stage 
to perform ten dances, each 
highlighting a different aspect 
of Indian subculture. Five of 
these dances, performed by the 
groups South Indian, Village, 
Bhangra, Raas and Bollywood, 
were cultural dances, aimed 
at 
embodying 
the 
more 

traditional customs of various 
Indian cities.

The 
other 
five 
groups, 

Fusion, Evolution, Filmi, all-
male Fusion and all-female 
Fusion, 
were 
fusion 
dance 

performances, 
aimed 
at 

combining the music and dance 
styles of Indian and American 
culture. Musical performances 
were 
dispersed 
throughout, 

one of which coming from 
South Asian a capella group 
Maize Mirchi.

Co-president 
Kshema 

Chirra, an LSA senior, noted 
the importance for the dancers 
and the audience of tying in 
elements of American music.

“We really try to mix the 

American and Indian music 
to 
captivate 
our 
audience, 

because 
obviously, 
our 

audience isn’t just the South 
Asian community; it’s a lot 
more than that,” Chirra said. 
“So, I think the ultimate goal 
of 
whatever 
performance 

we 
put 
on 
today 
at 
Hill 

Auditorium is just to capture 
the unique cultural mix that 

our organization embodies of 
being Indian American.”

In 
the 
moments 
before 

the performances began, the 
audience felt the energy from 
behind the stage curtains amid 
cheers of excitement could be 
heard from among the dancers. 
The first dance, performed by 
Filmi, immediately conveyed 
the 
weight 
that 
cultural 

mixing would have on the 
show, with traditional sounds 
of Indian music being fused 
with distinctly hip-hop beats.

Later, 
a 
dance 
by 
All-

female 
Fusion 
highlighted 

the intersectionality of being 
an Indian American woman, 
and 
provided 
a 
distinctly 

feminist 
performance 

where the soundtrack fused 
Beyoncé’s “Run the World” 
and customary Indian music. 
The crowd cheered as loudly to 
popular Indian songs as they 
did to dances that involved 
fidget spinners and the now-

famous “Backpack Kid” dance.

The 
choreographed 

moves 
were 
the 
kind 
of 

accomplishment 
that 
could 

only come from 10 months 
of preparation. For audience 
members who had seen IASA’s 
cultural 
show 
before, 
this 

year’s performance was among 
the most impressive they’ve 
seen.

Engineering 
senior 

Christopher Scott particularly 
enjoyed the cultural dance of 
Bhangra.

“A lot of color, a lot of 

movements,” Scott said. “This 
is the second time I’ve been 
to this, and it’s gotten even 
better.”

Halfway 
through 
the 

performances, 
members 
of 

IASA’s 
community 
service 

core came out to discuss their 
partnership with the Vidya 
Project. This initiative aims 
to bring online tutoring and 
mentorship 
to 
children 
in 

India and urge them to become 
“change-makers”: 
socially 

impactful global citizens.

Between 
dance 

performances, audiences were 
also given a taste of what it’s 
like to be a member of IASA. 
Parody videos in which IASA 
board members re-created a 
favorite scene from the TV 
show “The Office” or lip-
synced in a car in the style 
of James Corden’s “Carpool 
Karaoke” demonstrated the 
bonds 
created 
within 
the 

organization.

Beyond the choreography, 

clothing 
and 
musical 

sequences, 
organizers 

said 
audiences 
left 
Hill 

Auditorium 
with 
the 

understanding 
of 
IASA’s 

ability 
to 
bring 
students 

together. As Gummadi said 
of lessons learned during her 
time with IASA, “If you want 
to go fast, go alone. But if you 
want to go far, go together.”

program 
has 
divided 
city 

residents from its inception 
three years ago. Supporters, 
including 
University 
of 

Michigan 
biologists, 
assert 

it is the most effective way 
in 
dealing 
with 
vehicle 

collisions, risk of Lyme and 
chronic wasting diseases, and 
ecological damage stemming 
from 
deer 
overpopulation. 

Opponents 
criticize 
the 

program as violent and accuse 
City Council of not being 
transparent 
in 
its 
public 

dealings.

According to a 2016 survey, 

54 
percent 
of 
residents 

approved 
of 
using 
lethal 

methods. Every City Council 
member 
shares 
this 
view, 

each of whom voted against 
a 
budget 
amendment 
that 

would have defunded the deer 
management program earlier 
this year. Forty-five percent 
of residents were opposed. In 
addition, according to the same 
survey, 61 percent of residents 
supported nonlethal methods 
such 
as 
contraception, 

trapping 
and 
sterilization, 

regardless of their views on 
employing lethal methods.

Last year, the city expanded 

nonlethal 
methods 
to 

accommodate residents who 
were opposed to the cull. The 
city also commissioned the 
Michigan 
State 
University 

Office for Survey Research 
to conduct a new survey this 
year and aims to reach a 75 
percent satisfaction rate from 
residents.

However, 
the 
city 
not 

only increased the projected 
number of deer it will cull 
this year, but also decreased 
funding 
for 
nonlethal 

operations. 
Moreover, 
City 

Council 
eliminated 
a 
rule 

in 
which 
sharpshooters 

cannot shoot within 450 feet 
of an occupied building or 
residence without the owner’s 
permission, heightening fears 
that bystanders may be injured 
or killed.

City councilmember Jason 

Frenzel, D-Ward 1, explained 

Council did away with the 
rule, mandated by the state 
of Michigan, because only 
“hunters” 
fall 
under 
its 

purview, not “sharpshooters.” 
He said however strict safety 
rules must be put in place 
before any shooting starts.

“We must put into effect 

safety protocols that make 
sure that we’re not shooting 
towards 
people,” 
Frenzel 

said. 
“In 
my 
mind, 
any 

specific distance is in some 
ways arbitrary. Therefore the 
decision on what that distance 
is is more about the other 
precautions that take effect.”

Frenzel also said funding 

for 
the 
lethal 
program 

increased 
comparatively 

because Council pulled money 
from future operational funds 
to reduce the net amount spent 
on the multi-year cull and 
said the body has not given 
up on exploring non-lethal 
alternatives.

“Evidence 
shows 
that 

moving the reproduction base 
to a lower amount as soon as 
possible will also reduce our 
funding obligations into the 
future,” Frenzel said.

Ann Arbor resident Valerie 

Carey wrote in the comment 
section of the petition page 
she felt uncomfortable with 
sharpshooters walking around 
in her neighborhood.

“I was walking my dog 

last winter in a park & got 
disoriented on a trail toward 
late afternoon and ended up 
being in the park’s wooded 
area 
later 
than 
intended 

coming perilously close to 
the time when the shooting 
was to begin in that park,” 
Carey wrote. “It was not my 
intention to be there that late, 
but it happened and I was 
very worried for the safety of 
myself & my (leashed) dog.”

However, 
White 
Buffalo 

Inc., the contractor the city 
hired for culling operations, 
maintains 
the 
nonprofit’s 

sharpshooters have operated 
in other areas without the 450-
foot rule without incident over 
the past two decades.

LSA senior Aaron Brodkey, 

co-president of the Michigan 
Animal 
Respect 
Society, 

shared the petition on multiple 
social media pages, including 
pages for the class of 2018, ‘19 
and ‘20. He said he has worked 
with FAAWN since a member 
of the organization contacted 
him after a protest in January 

to bring awareness to the issue.

Brodkey 
said 
the 
issue 

directly 
affects 
students 

because 
of 
the 
location 

where some of these culling 
operations are happening.

“The University of Michigan 

owns a lot of the city’s parks, 
for instance the Arb and 
North Campus and these are 
places that a lot of students 
go and so they should know 
that (there are) most likely 
(to) be sharpshooters on these 
parts of campus killing deer,” 
Brodkey said. “It’s important 
for public safety reasons that 
students are aware of this.”

“If 
(students 
are) 
not 

okay 
with 
having 
hired 

sharpshooters 
on 
these 

premises, they should sign the 
petition and tell the City that 
they would much rather value 
the City looking towards non-
lethal options,” he added.

However, 
Jim 
Kosteva, 

community relations director 
for the University, told The 
Daily in a previous article 
involving 
a 
separate 
anti-

cull petition that University 
property 
has 
suffered 

environmentally 
and 

financially 
unsustainable 

damage through deer grazing.

“The Nichols Arboretum, 

which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 

a 
showcase 
and 
living 

laboratory of diverse species, 
has been unable to establish 
many seedlings due to the 
overgrazing 
of 
the 
deer 

herd,” Kosteva wrote. “The 
University has also incurred 
a significant loss of landscape 
materials, 
particularly 
on 

North Campus, that have been 
consumed or damaged by deer. 
Replacing that material has 
required a costly diversion of 
funds that otherwise could 
support more mission centered 
activities.”

eight of those attempts for 56 
yards, and added a touchdown 
pass on a throwback screen to 
sophomore tight end Sean McKeon 
on Michigan’s opening drive.

As for the Golden Gophers, 

well, their offensive success 
ended after their second series.

Minnesota 
answered 
the 

Wolverines’ first touchdown 
by using 10 plays to go 75 yards 
— nine of which yielded 59 
rushing yards. Rodney Smith 

provided 
the 
exclamation 

point, rushing 10 yards into the 
end zone to cap it all off.

From there, though, the 

wheels fell off — or at least 
Michigan forced them to.

Minnesota 
mustered 
36 

second-half yards, finishing the 
night with just 164 total while 
adding a field goal in the final 
two minutes. Redshirt junior 
defensive end Chase Winovich 
and sophomore VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson’s 
combined 
third-

quarter effort highlighted the 
dominant defensive showing.

On 
2nd-and-10 
from 

Michigan’s 42-yard line, Hudson 

got to Minnesota quarterback 

Demry Croft for a strip sack. 
Winovich pounced on the loose 
ball, and Higdon notched his 

second touchdown of the night 
on the ensuing possession.

Evans 
added 
his 
second 

only a drive later, and the 
Wolverines had put the game 
well out of reach before the 
fourth quarter even started. 

“A couple times, I’m blocking 

my guy (for) a couple seconds, 
waiting 
for 
the 
whistle,” 

McKeon said. “All of a sudden 
the crowd starts roaring. I look 
up, and Chris or Karan is gone.” 

So it went for the duo, and 

so Michigan went. Higdon 
and Evans got the blocks they 
needed, then they took care of 
the rest.

We must put 

into effect 

safety protocols 

that make 

sure that we’re 
not shooting 

towards people. 
In my mind, any 
specific distance 

in some ways 

arbitrary. 

All of a sudden, 
the crowd starts 
roaring. I look 
up, and Chris or 
Karan is gone.


T

here’s 
something 

cathartic about parody, 
especially 
when 
it’s 

directed toward the politically 
powerful. Donald Trump is 
somewhat unique in this respect 
— not just with regard to Alec 
Baldwin’s famous appearances 
as him on SNL, but in the way 
many Americans have started 
to talk about him in day-to-day 
life. Other politicians have, of 
course, been the target of parody 
(Sarah Palin and Barack Obama), 
but none have garnered such 
sustained and intense ridicule.

This habitual mockery — the 

use of Drumpf, for example 
— is becoming something of a 
legitimate problem. When we 
engage with the reality of a 
Trump presidency through these 
layers of humor and, for lack of a 
better word, zingers, we blind 
ourselves to the real climate 
of our political environment. 
Americans who prefer a stable 
head of state would be well-
served to be more cautious in the 
way they talk about Trump.

Mitt Romney won the 2012 

Republican primary when I 
was in eighth grade, much to 
my 
disappointment. 
Looking 

back on Romney’s stunningly 
awful general election campaign 
(remember the 47 percent line?) 
and right-wing media reactions 
to 
this 
controversy 
at 
the 

time, though, I can’t help but 
see parallels to the way we’re 
engaging with Trump in 2016.

There was a sense that Obama 

was bound to lose, almost 
regardless of who won the 
Republican primary. Sure, some 
had their favorites, but it was in 
large part a partisan struggle, 
and the Democrats were stuck 
with Barack (Hussein!) Obama 
as their candidate. How could a 
Kenyan socialist compete with 
the all-American capitalist? This 
parody version of Obama, built 

by factions on the right, became 
the way Republican opposition 
and 
the 
Romney 
campaign 

engaged with their opponent.

This 
sort 
of 
behavior 

is 
where 
the 
anti-Trump 

faction in American politics 
has 
miscalculated. 
Building 

a caricature of Trump and 
engaging with it, instead of 
the actual man, might have 
some psychological benefit in 
enabling Trump’s opponents to 
cope with his often-frightening 
behavior. 
The 
downside, 

though, is that it skews the 
national 
perception 
of 
his 

actual character. No matter 
how 
wild 
or 
authoritarian 

his actions become, it fits 
within the construction. It’ll 
be Trump, acting the way we 
assumed he’d act.

Though they could not be more 

different on a personal level, 
Obama was treated much the 
same way in the run-up to 2012. 
Right-wing media spent at least a 
day lambasting him for the way he 
ate a hamburger and for the color 
of his suit. Glenn Beck treated us 
to daily doses of madness with his 
chalkboard. A Romney victory 
appeared inevitable.

And then he lost 332 to 206.
There are a lot of wonderfully 

sadistic clips of the meltdown 
that night — Karl Rove ordering 
Megyn Kelly to “check (the 
numbers) again” is a particular 
highlight — but now I can’t help 
but see them as eerily prophetic of 
the left’s own future come 2020, 
if it’s not careful. There is an 
immense risk of overconfidence 
that could enable even a serial 
incompetent like Donald Trump 
to secure two terms.

The shock over Romney’s loss 

came largely from a Republican 
overindulgence 
in 
self-

congratulation. The Tea Party 
had gained a number of House 
seats in prior elections, the 

Democrats had been rendered 
ineffective in the House and 
Senate, and I guess it was easy to 
feel that the presidency would be 
next to fall.

When we constantly refer 

to Trump and his supporters 
through a layer of parody — 
“Trumpkins,” “Drumpf,” “Little 
Donnie” — we lose the ability to 
properly evaluate the threat he 
actually poses (or doesn’t pose). 
Furthermore, the left, unlike the 
Tea Party in 2012, isn’t even in 
power. The delusion that could 
rise — that I think is rising — 
from treating Trump like a joke 
will be even greater.

To be fair, Donald Trump has 

a much lower approval rating 
now than Obama did during 
November of his first year or 
even before the 2012 election. 
Legitimate scandal — about 
Russia and Robert Mueller’s 
investigation — might make some 
impact, but probably not as much 
as one might hope considering 
the significance of the events. 
Our national reaction to scandal 
has been numbed, particularly 
with regard to Trump. I can’t 
help but think that his perpetual 
parody is feeding into this by 
making him more of a character 
than a political figure.

Three years from now — given 

nearly a thousand more days of 
incoherent tweets, controversy 
and routine scandal — the left 
might find itself having neglected 
to run a proper campaign, with 
improperly calibrated opposition 
tactics. It’s going up against the 
fool Donald Drumpf, after all. 
It seems eminently possible, 
though, that come November 
2020 one will hear a bewildered 
Democratic 
Party 
echoing 

Republican sentiment in 2012: 
“But we hated him so much.”

tudent A: “You’re applying 
too? I love their campus 
over in Seattle, but I’m 

pretty sure my grade-
point average doesn’t 
fit their cutoffs.”

Student B: “Apply 

anyway, man! They 
have a great four-year 
program. My GPA isn’t 
too high, but the rep. 
seemed interested in 
my leadership roles 
and I’m pretty sure 
I aced the written 
statement.”

Student A: “I guess ... but I just 

don’t have the connections some 
of my friends had. I’ll just stick 
with a few safety mid-tiers and 
test my luck there.”

This conversation, you may 

have thought, was between a 
couple of high school kids applying 
to the University of Washington 
… or was it two University of 
Michigan juniors stressing over 
their 
recruiting 
prospects? 
I 

wouldn’t blame you for thinking 
high school — the on-campus 
recruitment scene mirrors the 
college application process in 
strangely familiar ways. This 
similarity reveals a surprising 
amount about the system most of 
us currently find ourselves in — it 
pigeonholes us into a select few 
careers, creates undue stress and 
promotes an overly linear way of 
thinking about success.

This 
recruitment 
process 

has been reduced to a science, 
a formula used by the best 
companies in every industry to 
recruit wide-eyed talent from 
the best schools in the nation. 
The formula works so well 
because it thrives on the linear-
minded path to achievement 
that is instilled into us in high 
school and college. It is a system 
of hoop-jumping — a static set of 
stages necessary to pass in order 
to gain access to another clearly 
defined role: your future job.

Let’s imagine you are a 

junior 
embarking 
on 
your 

search to find a high-status, 
well-paying internship for the 
upcoming summer. You begin by 
checking out that big consulting 
company’s info session after 
class and see a lot of your friends 
there. You begin asking each 
other questions: Who’s gotten in 
here before? Do they even take 
LSA kids? The recruiter departs 
with a motivating message about 
how her company is molding 

top students like you into the 
21st-century, globally minded 
visionaries who will soon change 

the world.

You think back to 

the same motivating 
words your college 
counselor used to stir 
your passion to apply 
to 
the 
University. 

You quickly run to 
the résumé drop the 
next week, spending 
hours scrapping old 
copies and passing 
suggestions 
with 

friends and family. Next come 
the coffee chats, the interviews 
and, if you play your cards right, 
the final offer.

At first glance, it may seem easier 

for us that this process mirrors 
that of college applications, but it 
only further pushes a mindset that 
success can be achieved through 
a linear process. This works up 
until the point we find ourselves 
in the real world, where there’s 
no syllabus, no clear promotional 
paths at work and little support 
structure to lean on outside friends 
and family. Recruiters are aware 
of this, and they exploit the last 
opportunity in a young person’s 
life to hoop-jump as a way to 
influence them to work jobs that 
may not have necessarily appealed 
to them without the high status 
they entail.

Hidden 
behind 
the 
status 

curtain of many of the jobs 
University students apply to is the 
rough reality of 60- to 80-hour 
work weeks, monotonous tasks 
and a stressful work environment. 
This isn’t limited to business: Big 
law, medicine and engineering jobs 
seem to attract a disproportionate 
share of students compared to 
the vast numbers of other career 
options out there. There is nothing 
inherently wrong with these jobs, 
and it’s hard to fault people for 
seeking their benefits. However, 
it’s unfortunate that the tracked 
processes we’ve gone through do 
little to encourage us to discover 
our own interests.

William Deresiewicz, a former 

professor at Yale University, 
wrote a scathing critique of his 
students who ditched their real 
interests for the hoop-jumping 
of careerism. Asked about the 
recruiting process in an Atlantic 
interview, he noted: “(Students) 
haven’t turned to themselves 
to ask why they’re doing it. It’s 
almost like a cruel experiment 

with 
animals 
that 
we’re 

performing — every time the red 
light goes on, you have to push the 
bar. Of course they’re stressed.” 
His analogy works well. We’ve 
been 
accustomed 
to 
neatly 

passing the steps presented to us 
as young adults — get As in high 
school, lead some clubs, ace the 
SAT — that we forget we’re doing 
the same steps in college, even 
without our parents’ influence. 
The only difference is the end 
goal of getting an offer from a 
well-known company.

The stress of recruiting is 

palpable at the University. A 
2014 health and wellness report 
by the University revealed that 
26 percent of students faced 
“traumatic or very difficult to 
handle stress stemming from 
career related issues in the last 
12 months.” Some of this stress 
can certainly be attributed to 
the narrow set of hard-to-enter 
careers to which students are 
pushed to apply. The situation is 
like the “cocktail party” test: We 
want strangers to light up when 
we announce we’re attending 
an elite school or job, since 
many adults, especially parents, 
associate these achievements as 
the only hallmark of success.

While many aren’t doing this 

consciously, 
there 
is 
comfort 

in 
impressing 
others 
through 

associating with a big name rather 
than our specific experiences 
and goals. The name is instant 
credentialing; it allows us to take 
mental shortcuts and judge others. 
I believe a key aspect of mental 
health is separating ourselves 
from this thought process. Since 
everyone is unique, we should avoid 
the crowd mentality of what defines 
success for a student graduating 
from a high-caliber university.

Separating from this mentality 

will continue to be difficult if 
college remains a system that 
largely encourages linear-minded 
paths 
of 
achievement. 
Many 

students will stay attracted to 
the recruitment process for good 
reason and should embrace it if 
they feel it best suits their life goals 
and interests. If, however, you are 
skeptical about the “tracked” career 
paths, listen to your gut and shrug 
off any judgments others make 
about you. Life just may reward you

Ward 2: Jared Hoffert

For the race in Ward 2, the 

Editorial Board supports Jared 
Hoffert for City Council over 
the incumbent Jane Lumm. 
While 
Lumm’s 
campaign 

platform is very focused on 
maintaining the status quo, 
Hoffert’s campaign offers the 
prospect of positive change. 
Specifically, 
Lumm 
seems 

focused 
on 
maintaining 

existing infrastructure, while 
Hoffert offers to implement new 
policies, including increasing 
mass 
transit. 
As 
students, 

we are very much concerned 
with 
affordable 
housing. 

While neither candidate has 
a detailed affordable housing 
policy, Hoffert is much more 
flexible on this topic, which he 
addressed in an interview with 
The Daily.

Most importantly, Lumm’s 

platform supports increased 
police presence in Ann Arbor. 
Given the controversial arrest 
of an Ann Arbor teen in 
September and the policing of 
Black and Latino fraternities 
on Oct. 7, the Editorial Board is 
concerned with and troubled 
by this platform. Additionally, 
a larger police force does not 
seem necessary given Ann 
Arbor’s relatively low crime 
rates, 
with 
violent 
crime 

only affecting 1.81 per 1,000 
residents. Lumm also voted 
against making Ann Arbor a 
sanctuary city, which makes the 
Editorial Board apprehensive 
about her inclusivity of all 
people in Ann Arbor.

We believe Jared Hoffert 

is the best choice for Ward 
2. In addition, we urge both 
candidates to include more 
detailed policy platforms on 
their websites.
Ward 4: Jack Eaton

For Ward 4, we support the 

incumbent Jack Eaton, largely 
due to his views on affordable 
housing. 
Eaton 
recognizes 

the 
issues 
surrounding 

affordable housing in the Ann 
Arbor area and realizes the 
role of gentrification in the 
problem. In contrast, Diane 

Giannola seems to distinguish 
between affordable housing 
and affordability in housing. 
Her housing policy centers on 
ensuring individuals can afford 
homes within their financial 
needs, choosing not to address 
the needs for subsidized housing 
and low-income housing. Eaton 
acknowledges 
the 
problem 

and proposes not based in 
the market. However, Eaton 
ought to take more action to 
directly engage with the issue of 
affordable housing and act upon 
the courage of his convictions 
with substantive policy.

Additionally, 
Eaton 

encourages 
student 

involvement and acknowledges 
the significance of students 
participating 
in 
civic 
life, 

while Giannola does the very 
opposite. In a prior interview 
with 
The 
Daily, 
Giannola 

states she views students as 
transient to Ann Arbor and 
believes local issues do not 
concern 
them 
whatsoever. 

In 
fact, 
students 
in 
Ann 

Arbor are a key component 
to the city’s economy and are 
directly affected by the issue 
of affordable housing.

Due to his receptivity to 

student voice and insight in 
instituting more affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor, we 
support Jack Eaton.
Ward 5: Chip Smith

For Ward 5, the Editorial 

Board 
endorses 
Chip 

Smith, who is running for 
his second term on Ann 
Arbor City Council against 
newcomer Ali Ramlawi. Due 
to his incumbency, Smith 
has greater insight into Ann 
Arbor’s 
position 
and 
the 

feasibility of potential actions. 
He utilizes his knowledge and 
experience to concretely cite 
figures and outline plans on 
his campaign website.

Smith’s 
stances 
on 

affordable housing are more 
comprehensive, 
proactive 

and complete than those of 
Ramlawi. Smith cites exact 
numbers — 3,137 units of 
“workforce housing” by the 

year 2025. While Ramlawi 
acknowledges that a housing 
crisis in Ann Arbor is causing 
a lack of affordability and low 
diversity, he offers no clear 
solution or plan of action to 
counter the crisis.

Smith 
also 
has 
a 
more 

comprehensive 
stance 
on 

sustainability in Ann Arbor. 
He references several ongoing 
projects such as his Climate 
Action Plan — already in effect 
in Ann Arbor — that aims 
to 
reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 

emissions 25 percent by 2025. 
Ramlawi, who by no means 
seems against environmental 
progress, simply outlines the 
issues that Ann Arbor is facing 
without providing truly concrete 
solutions or ideal projects.

Finally, Ramlawi’s operation 

of a local business presents a 
possible conflict of interest if he 
were elected a member of City 
Council. Ramlawi’s Ann Arbor 
restaurant, Jerusalem Garden, 
was one of the plaintiffs in the 
2009 lawsuit against the city 
over plans to sell the Library 
Lot to developers. The City 
Council recently voted in favor 
of selling the lot to Chicago 
developer Core Spaces.

The incumbent advantage 

certainly gives Smith a leg up 
over Ramwali in this election, 
and 
we 
think 
his 
clearer 

vision would allow more to be 
accomplished under his tenure.

City Council policies have 

an immense effect on students 
at colleges in Ann Arbor. We 
implore students to go out and 
vote on Nov. 7. At the same 
time, we’re disappointed by 
the lack of acknowledgment 
candidates give to students. 
Despite the huge presence 
college students have in Ann 
Arbor, very few candidates 
gave weight to student voices 
in their campaigns. We ask 
that City Council candidates 
listen to Ann Arbor students 
and reflect their voices in 
each 
candidate’s 
respective 

platforms, as their actions are 
imperative to all members of 
the Ann Arbor community.

FROM THE DAILY

Vote for City Council

O

n Nov. 7, Ann Arbor will be electing five City Council members, 
one from each of the five wards. This year, three of the seats — in 
Wards 2, 4 and 5 — are contested. The councilors elected this year 

will serve three-year terms, as the first phase of a new policy that extends 
City Council terms from two to four years. This extended duration in office 
makes it more important than ever for voters to make informed voting 
decisions. Local government affects not only permanent residents of Ann 
Arbor, but also University of Michigan students who spend the majority of 
their year in the city. The Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board endorses the 
following candidates and calls on students to cast a vote in these elections.

DISNEY

Thor’s back and this time not with a fairly disappointing plot line
‘Ragnarok’ ends ‘Thor’ 
trilogy on a strong note

Under Waititi’s direction, finale to the Marvel arc thrives

It’s hard to imagine a better 

director for “Thor: Ragnarok” 
than Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the 
Wilderpeople”). At first glance, the 
native New Zealander behind some 
of the best comedies of the last 
decade appears to fly in the face of 
everything the “Thor” movies have 
been set up to be so far, and that’s 
because he does. The first film in the 
franchise briefly benefitted from 
Kenneth Branagh’s Shakespearean 
influence in its opening act, but 
apart from that, it and the turgid 
“The Dark World” rank as two of 
the most forgettable films in the 
Marvel Cinematic Universe. While 
intermittently entertaining, they 
seem to labor under the delusion 
that they have far more gravitas 
than they actually do, and with 
the exceptions of Thor (Chris 
Hemsworth, “Ghostbusters”) and 
Loki (Tom Hiddleston, “Kong: 
Skull Island”), the characters are 
universally one-note and flat.

With “Ragnarok,” Waititi looks 

to best those films in finally leaning 
into the strengths of its leads and 
its characters. To that end, this 
“Thor” film plays much more like 
a buddy comedy than the faux-epic 
space operas of its predecessors. 
Hemsworth 
is 
allowed 
to 

stretch the comedic muscles he’s 
established outside the MCU — 
most recently by acting circles 
around the cast of “Ghostbusters” 
— and there’s an unending air of fun 
from the opening action sequence 
to the final post-credit stinger. 
Most importantly, it achieves this 

without ever sacrificing stakes for 
comedy, something not only the 
“Thor” films, but the MCU as a 
whole, have historically struggled 
with.

That’s not to say that there aren’t 

bumps in the road. The first act 
must clean up the mess left by the 
cliffhanger to “The Dark World,” 
and so the script bounces from one 

plot point to another without giving 
any time for development. Scenes 
that should have great emotional 
weight are glossed over at a 
moment’s notice just to make room 
for the next big thing to happen. As 
a result, the first twenty minutes or 
so are incredibly uneven, and the 
burden is suddenly on the middle 
of the movie to actually begin the 
story.

Thankfully, the rest of the 

movie — which sees Thor banished 
to a gladiatorial contest on the 
world of Sakaar after Hela (Cate 
Blanchett, “Carol”), the goddess of 
death, invades his home, Asgard 
— is more than up to the task. 
Sakaar is a fantastical setting that 
immediately differentiates itself 
from any locale in the MCU so far 
thanks to Waititi’s unique sense 
of style and stellar production 
design work from “Lord of the 
Rings” veterans Dan Hennah and 
Ra Vincent. The garbage planet, a 

sort of intergalactic dump, suits the 
tone of the film perfectly.

Sakaar’s inhabitants and the 

rest of the supporting cast add 
further shades of idiosyncratic 
color. Blanchett is clearly having 
the time of her life devouring the 
scenery alongside Karl Urban 
(“Star Trek Beyond”) as her lackey, 
Skurge. She proves to be one of the 
best villains in the MCU thusfar 
thanks to her magnificently over-
the-top performance alone. Her 
extravagance is matched only by 
Jeff 
Goldblum 
(“Independence 

Day: 
Resurgence”) 
as 
the 

Grandmaster, ruler of Sakaar, in 
what can only be described as the 
most Goldblum performance to 
ever have been Goldblummed. It’s 
self-satirization at its best. Still, 
its Waititi himself who steals the 
show in his part as Korg, an alien 
life form who Thor meets in the 
arena and who “tried to start a 
revolution but didn’t print enough 
pamphlets.”

But it’s “Ragnarok”’s ability 

to function as a suitable ending 
to Thor’s arc that is its greatest 
strength. It’s certainly entertaining 
throughout with only a few 
missteps to detract from its value, 
but as the movie wound to a close, 
I was struck by an appreciation 
for how far Thor has come in his 
three solo outings. The movies 
themselves haven’t always been 
perfect or even all that good, but 
the god of thunder himself has 
been a consistently compelling 
character. It’s a pity it took this long 
to give him a movie as engaging as 
he is, but if this really is the end of 
his story, then it’s a solid note to go 
out on.

BOOK REVIEW
In ‘Ask: Building Consent 
Culture’ ideas are tested 

In a world that seems to finally, 

at times, be paying due attention 
to rampant sexual violence, a new 
anthology of essays edited by Kitty 
Stryker seeks to push the discourse 
around consent further. The essays 
in “Ask: Building Consent Culture” 
takes the ideas that have recently 
come to the forefront about sex 
and individuals and applies them 
not only to the bedroom (though 
that is the first collection of essays) 
but also to other areas of public 
life, including schools, the prison 
system, the workplace, the home, 
the hospital and alternative sex 
communities. In her introduction, 
Stryker, a writer and activist who 
specializes in developing consent 
culture in alternative communities, 
argues against the rhetoric of sex 
positivity or negativity in favor of 
a “sex critical” attitude, in order to 
reflect the acknowledgment that 
there is still a ways to go for sex 
positivity to truly achieve the goals 
it purports to have.

Some of these essays may be 

more relatable than others — the 
first is titled “Sex and Love When 
You Hate Yourself and Don’t Have 
Your Shit Together,” and one of 
the final essays is “Sleeping with 

the Fishes: A Skinny Dip into Sex 
Parties” — but all make readers 
reconsider their framework of 
consent. The first essay, by Av 
Flox, sets the groundwork for the 
rest of the anthology by putting 
forth the argument that “the 
legal framework of consent is 
worthless,” and that by deciding as 
a society that we could use a legal 
framework as a primary analysis 

of consent, we are letting down 
survivors of assault. Another essay 
by Richard Wright offers insight 
on how to begin practicing consent 
culture from a young age.

One of the more fascinating 

essays, by Navarre Overton is “The 
Kids Aren’t All Right: Consent 
and Our Miranda Rights,” which 
discusses how though we might 

have a cultural familiarity with 
the Miranda Rights, that doesn’t 
mean everyone, especially minors 
or people for whom English is 
a second language, understand 
them fully. And without a full 
understanding of their Miranda 
Rights, 
people 
cannot 
fully 

consent to all legal procedures. 
(A side effect of reading this essay 
includes thinking hard about the 
role that the plethora of cop shows 
and buddy cop movies plays in 
our media’s treatment of police 
brutality narratives, so be warned.)

Other essays include discussions 

of of the role that disclosure 
plays in the lives of trans people, 
subtle negotiations of consent in 
polyamorous 
relationships 
and 

beyond. Some aren’t for everyone 
— for example, Jiz Lee’s essay 
“‘Ethical 
Porn’ 
Starts 
When 

You Pay for It” might take some 
positions of the reader for granted 
when it shouldn’t, and others don’t 
sound as revolutionary now as they 
might have a decade ago — but they 
aren’t meant to be. Stryker wanted 
to use her anthology to elevate 
voices that are often marginalized, 
and this collection does so. The 
collection will prove a useful 
addition to the toolkit for those 
who are working towards not just 
towards sexual equality, but equity 
in all areas of public life.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW
A cozy evening at Literati 
with singer Jared Saltiel

Drawing from an array of influences, Saltiel’s performance pleased

I was in a bad mood last 

Thursday, but I was pleasantly 
surprised when I walked out of 
Literati feeling calmer.

Jared 
Saltiel, 
a 
folk 

musician, delivered an intimate 
performance in his hometown 
of Ann Arbor. The singer-
songwriter, 
producer 
and 

arranger 
alternated 
on 
the 

guitar and keyboard this past 
Thursday night.

I don’t know what I was 

expecting when I first heard 
his voice, but I was taken aback 
by the smooth, soft and gentle 
performance. I had listened 
to his songs online before the 
performance, but it’s always 
different to hear someone sing 
live. 

Saltiel 
performed 
several 

songs from his new album Out 
of Clay, which will be released 
in Feb 2018. His first album, The 
Light Within, explores mystical 
landscapes and takes the form of 
a travelogue.

He also sang his recently 

released 
single 
“Wayward 

Queen.” Opening with the lines 
“long before the leaves had 
turned, back when the Earth 
was green,” I could see the 
gorgeous delicacy of Saltiel’s 
poetic lines.

“Dreamcatcher” 
was 
the 

heart of Saltiel’s performance. 

Also a track from his new 
album, the emotion in his voice 
was palpable. For the first time 
that 
night, 
Saltiel 
stopped 

performing for us and started 
performing for himself 
— and it 

showed. He gained momentum 
with the build-up of the song at 
the beginning and kept going, 
receiving one of the loudest 

applauses of the night.

This emotion was also present 

in “Way with Words.” One of 
the beginning lyrics, “she’s just 
got a way with words, way with 
words,” was chilling. I found 
myself leaning in, wanting to 
know who he was singing about.

Saltiel had a casual and 

honest performance style. He 
talked about the influences on 

his songwriting, ranging from 
relationships to mythology to 
the most surprising of things: 
cats. Saltiel explained that while 
the cats could be taken as a 
metaphor for something larger, 
he really just wrote a song about 
the cats in his neighborhood, 
and he imagined them as the 
eyes and ears for someone.

I appreciated his work on the 

keyboard. Though Saltiel spent 
the majority of the performance 
on the guitar, each song played 
on the keyboard was unique, 
displaying the influence of jazz 
on his style.

Another highlight of the set 

was a welcome Brazilian song, 
and I respected how Saltiel 
challenged 
himself 
to 
sing 

in another language. He also 
played a more upbeat, R&B piece 
that refreshingly changed the 
pace of his set.

One of my favorite things 

about watching artists perform 
is 
seeing 
their 
connection 

to their work. To me, what 
distinguishes 
an 
artful 

performance 
from 
just 
a 

performance is when they allow 
themselves to be absorbed, to 
close their eyes, to perform as if 
it’s just them in a room. I loved 
each and every moment where 
Saltiel reveled in his own music. 
I think there was more space for 
him to lose his inhibitions, but 
overall, Saltiel sang a fantastic 
set. It was enough to be the best 
part of a very bleak day.

DAILY SOCIAL MEDIA COLUMN

Spacey & the complexities 

of online apologies

The epidemic of online apologies taking the place of personal ones

“I 
meant 
absolutely 
no 

disrespect.” “I apologize if you 
guys were offended.” “I should 
not have done this.” “I beg for your 
forgiveness.”

People make stupid, awful 

mistakes — and celebrities are 
no exception. But when it comes 
to living in the limelight, actors, 
athletes, musicians and politicians 
are much more vulnerable in 
how 
they 
handle 
themselves 

underneath a cultural magnifying 
glass.

Usually, whenever celebrities 

do something wrong, be it an 
illicit affair or an inappropriate, 
regrettable soundbite, they address 
it during awkward talk show 
segments, 
embarrassing 
press 

conferences and uncomfortable 
TV interviews. Some apologetic 
celebs are met with praise for their 
honesty and conviction to learn 
from their errors, though others 
ultimately become shunned in 
the public eye. Given how social 
media offers a transparent virtual 
platform for the famous to interact 
with their fans, most apologies 
from celebrities nowadays take 
place through the Internet.

What exactly can be said of 

the “online apology”? Is it better 
or worse than an outright public 
apology? Does it allow a celebrity 
a better opportunity to articulate 
themselves in their wrongdoings 
or does it just makes things worse? 
 

For Kevin Spacey (“House of 

Cards”), attempting to apologize 
online made things worse for 
everyone involved. Last week, 
the actor issued an apology on 
his Twitter account for making a 
sexual advance toward Anthony 
Rapp (“Star Trek: Discovery”) 
when Rapp was only 14-years-old. 
The incident was brought to light 
in a Buzzfeed article just a few days 
before Spacey’s apology, in which 
Rapp described his encounter with 
Spacey in full detail

“If I did behave then as he 

describes, I owe him the sincerest 
apology for what would have been 
deeply 
inappropriate 
drunken 

behavior,” Spacey wrote in his 
tweet. “I am sorry for the feelings 
he describes having carried with 
him all these years.”

In my mind, there is a correct 

and incorrect way to apologize 
to someone, period. This, folks, is 
the incorrect way. Even if Spacey’s 
sexual misconduct with Rapp 
is 
technically 
considered 
“an 

allegation,” recusing oneself from 
being involved in such a crime 
seems like a rather insincere and 
questionable gesture (i.e. saying 
“if I did behave” rather than “I did 
behave”).

What’s even more infuriating is 

how later in the statement, Spacey 
conflated his pedophilic actions 
with his coming out, suggesting 
the age-old homophobic trope that 
homosexual men prey on young 
boys. This particular moment 
in his apology ignited immense 
backlash from the Hollywood 
community and the media at large, 
and rightfully so. 

It’s entirely possible Spacey and 

his PR team managed to craft this 
tweet as a “coming out” statement 
in order to deflect the real problem 
at hand, or that Spacey simply felt 
the need to justify his actions by 
coming clean about his sexual 
orientation. 
Thankfully, 
online 

users are quick to cut through the 
bullshit, posting tweets and articles 
about how we should amplify 
the voice of the victim instead of 
the perpetrator. This method has 
worked to the users’ advantage. 
Since Spacey’s apology, more young 
men have come forward with 
sexual assault allegations against 
the actor, inevitably pressuring 

Netflix to fire Spacey from “House 
of Cards” and write out his 
character for the upcoming sixth 
and final season. 

The difficult thing, though, 

about an online apology is that 
a celebrity may be deemed lazy 
and cowardly whether or not they 
publish an apologetic tweet or a 
Facebook post. If they don’t say 
anything, then they’re an asshole. 
If they apologize on TV, then they 
come off as self-righteous. If they 
apologize something online, then 
they seem impersonal, as if they’re 
purposefully hiding behind social 
media to help maintain their 
credibility. No matter the context, 
a celebrity will always have to 
confront the idealized expectations 
of the public, especially when their 
mistakes aren’t super harmful to 
begin with.

Take, 
for 
example, 
Oscar-

winning actress Jennifer Lawrence 
(“Passengers”). Late last year, she 
caught flak for wiping her butt on 
sacred Hawaiian rocks and then 
joking about it on TV. She posted 
an apology on Facebook and since 
then, her reputation hasn’t been 
totally destroyed — Lawrence 
starred in this year’s “mother!” 

and recently guest hosted on 
Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show. A few 
months before that, Noah Galvin 
(“The Real O’Neals”) apologized 
on Twitter for several egregious 
remarks he made about the queer 
community in Hollywood during a 
Vulture interview. Like Lawrence, 
Galvin is continuing to thrive in 
his relatively young career. Though 
“The Real O’Neals” was cancelled 
after two seasons, Galvin is 
scheduled to replace Ben Platt 
in the lead role of “Dear Evan 
Hansen” after Platt’s Broadway 
run ends later this month.

At the time, these kinds of faux 

paus may have been insensitive. 
But do we really expect celebrities 
like Jennifer Lawrence or Noah 
Galvin to be perfect all the time? 
Had they not apologized at all, 
then maybe it would seem fair to 
hold a grudge against them. But 
having the capacity to apologize 
for their blunders in the first place 
seems like a good first step toward 
attaining forgiveness. 

That 
being 
said, 
everyone 

should 
be 
held 
accountable 

for the mistakes they make, 
regardless the magnitude of one’s 
actions. Should all celebrities be 
held to a higher standard than 
everyone else? Not really, unless 
you happen to be the President 
of the United States. But does a 
celebrity deserve attention if their 
actions holds much greater weight 
when they involve something as 
horrible as harassment or even 
rape? 
Absolutely. 
Considering 

the 
powerful 
ripple 
effect 

enacted 
from 
the 
series 
of 

sexual harassment and assault 
allegations against Hollywood 
producer Harvey Weinstein, a 
celebrity who has committed 
similar offenses must deal with 
intense retribution. It may ruin 
their careers and livelihoods, but 
if they hadn’t done such horrible, 
irrevocable things in the first 
place, then they wouldn’t be in 
such a situation.

Whether you’re famous or not, 

we can all learn from how people 
present themselves in public and in 
private, and how they approach the 
people they hurt. It seems rather 
simple, but an apology, let alone 
an online one, is not just enough 
to rectify the repercussions of 
one’s actions. One has to work 
hard to make right what they did 
wrong. If that means educating 
yourself on systemic racism after 
making a racist remark, so be it. If 
that means working at a women’s 
clinic or a trauma center after 
sexually harassing and assaulting 
someone, so be it. An apology isn’t 
just a statement or a promise; it’s a 
responsibility.

Jason Bateman directs and stars in Netflix’s ‘Ozark’
Beating the heat with the 
visually stunning ‘Ozark’

Recounting a summer love affair with the Netflix original series

Hot. Humid. Muggy.
Whatever term you use to 

describe the weather when it’s 
unbearably hot outside, that’s 
what my past summer was like 
in Washington, D.C. Interning 
on Capitol Hill, I spent my days 
schlepping across the scorching 
city twice a day. My days began and 
ended with cramped, overheated 
bus rides across K Street, a 
commute which usually clocked 
in at 45 minutes. That sweaty 
daily trip left me exhausted by 
the time I returned home to my 
cozy Georgetown abode. I needed 
something to cool off. I needed 
Netflix’s “Ozark.”

Initially, I was hesitant to wade 

into the waters of “Ozark.” Despite 
all of its acclaim, I couldn’t get over 
my fears about having first-time 
director Jason Bateman (“Horrible 
Bosses”) at the helm of the series. 
I couldn’t shake the image of 
Bateman as the hilarious Michael 
Bluth in “Arrested Development,” 
and I refused to believe that 
he could produce any sort-of 
competent drama. Well, I’m not 
afraid to say it now: I was totally 
and utterly wrong.

My love affair with Netflix’s 

“Ozark” started after a typical 
Monday of shuttling back and 
forth between Capitol Hill and 
Georgetown. Since I’d missed my 
bus that day, I was forced to wait 
another half-hour for the next 
one to arrive, meaning I only got 
home around 8 o’clock that night. 
Utterly exhausted, I did what most 
Michigan students do — I ordered 
Domino’s and settled into bed 
as I eagerly waited for my piping 
hot pizza. As I scrolled through 
Netflix’s recommendations and 
new releases, I got a text from my 

brother instructing me to “watch 
Ozark right fucking now.” His blunt 
endorsement, coupled with my 
need to kill time, finally got me over 
my mental hump, and I switched 
on “Ozark.”

With the lights dimmed and 

my personal home theater set up, 
my eyes remained comfortably 
glued to the gorgeous, blue-
filtered Missouri vistas of “Ozark.” 
Although I was dazzled by its 
visuals, I didn’t enjoy the show 
itself. I couldn’t figure out exactly 
what Bateman’s character, Marty 
Byrde, did, and the entire plotline 
of Byrde laundering money for a 
Mexican drug cartel just seemed 
too “out-there” and unrealistic.

As confused as I was by 

Marty, I didn’t have any issue 
understanding his wife’s character, 
Wendy 
(Laura 
Linney, 
“The 

Truman Show”). Playing the role 
of a mere jaded housewife on the 
surface, Linney excels at providing 
depth to her character and showing 
that this label is deceiving. Linney 
stars in the series, but her ruthless 
nature makes me glad I’m not one 
of her kids Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz, 
“Louie”) or Jonah (Skylar Gaertner, 
“Daredevil”).

Maybe it was because I was a 

bit hangry, or maybe I just didn’t 
understand “Ozark”’s pilot, but 
once armed with my Domino’s and 
the series’ second episode, I quickly 
started to like the show. Over the 
course of that second episode, 
“Blue Cat,” I turned from being one 
of Marty’s biggest critics to one of 
his most loyal supporters. I couldn’t 
help but love the way Marty 
managed 
to 
garner 
universal 

respect for his investment acumen, 
almost like a young, criminal 
version of Warren Buffett.

With 
his 
savvy 
business 

maneuvers, I started to see Marty 
less as a wannabe Walter White 
(Bryan Cranston, “Breaking Bad”), 

as I initially viewed him, and closer 
to the real deal. Both brilliant 
money launderers with a penchant 
for talking their way out of near-
death situations, I noticed shades 
of White in Marty, though, to 
Cranston’s credit, his performance 
was 
incredible 
enough 
that 

Anthony Hopkins (“Silence of the 
Lambs”) — of all people — called it 
“the best acting I have seen - ever.”

Following that brilliant second 

installment in the series, I had to 
use all of my willpower to compel 
myself to go to bed, rather than 
screen the next episode. Still, I 
would get to episode three, “My 
Dripping Sleep,” soon enough, as 
I found myself with a few spare 
minutes at lunch the next day at 
the office. Once I noticed the extra 
time I had, there was about a half-
second delay before I pulled up 
the Netflix app on my phone and 
started “My Dripping Sleep.”

And so began a weekday 

tradition. Each morning, I’d watch 
a few minutes of “Ozark” before I 
boarded the bus into Capitol Hill, 
then screen more of the episode 
at lunch. Later, I’d finish the 
episode from the friendly walls of 
my Georgetown red-brick, before 
repeating the cycle all over again 
the next day. It may have been 90 
degrees outside, but I didn’t care 
— in my mind I was constantly 
cooling off in the shimmering 
waters of Lake “Ozark.”

Unfortunately, 
like 
a 
good 

house party, my tradition ended 
far too soon. Due to my daily 
binge-watching, I finished the 
entire season in four days — I was 
done by the time Friday rolled 
around. Without “Ozark” to sate 
my appetite for stellar television, 
my workdays lost a bit of their 
luster. I had returned to the muggy 
confines of Washington, D.C., but, 
for some reason, it didn’t feel quite 
as hot anymore.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Benedict brings ‘Wolf 
Season’’s pointed gaze

Columbia professor aims to broaden the genre of war narratives

“We need to grow…”
“There’s been this huge sort of 

burst of Iraq and Afghanistan war 
literature,” said Helen Benedict in 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “99.9 percent of it has been 
written by White men, most whom 
have MFA degrees. Those have 
really, really good novels among 
them, but if you think about it from 
a larger perspective, it’s a very, very 
narrow way to look at this war.”

Benedict, a professor at the 

Columbia 
University 
Graduate 

School of Journalism, has made it 
her mission broaden the identities 
and experiences represented in 
the literary narrative of war, one 
that has been dominated by the 
perspective of the White male 
American 
veteran. 
Benedict’s 

“Sand 
Queen,” 
a 
Publisher’s 

Weekly 
“Best 
Contemporary 

Novel,” became the first book about 
the Iraq war written from a female 

viewpoint whose leading character, 
Kate Brady, is an American soldier.

Following “The Lonely Soldier,” 

a nonfiction account of five women 
who fought in the Iraq war between 
2003 and 2006, Benedict’s release 
of “Wolf Season” marks the third 
work in her succession of books 
representing female viewpoints of 
modern war in the Middle East.

“‘Wolf Season’ is mostly about 

the aftermath of war… how they 
bring the war home,” Benedict said.

And Benedict is bringing her 

account of the effects of war to our 
home of Ann Arbor this coming 
Tuesday. Literati will welcome 
Benedict to share an excerpt 
of “Wolf Season,” speak on her 
extensive research to “explore the 
effects of war on the human heart” 
and open a dialogue with the 
audience to answer questions.

After the U.S invasion in Iraq in 

2003, Benedict embarked on three 
years of research into the effects of 
war, first by interviewing veterans 
from the Iraq war — male and 
female — and going on to expand 

the reach of her research to include 
those perspectives of Iraqis who 
had fled to the United States in 
search of refuge.

“My interviewees would go 

deep deep deep in their stories 
and memories, and sometimes 
they would hit a wall where they 
reached a memory that was … too 
painful to say aloud 
or even to remember,” 
Benedict said. “I came 
to realize it was in 
those silences, in that 
territory … where the 
real people couldn’t 
go, that the true inner 
experience of the war 
lay, like what it does 
to your heart and 
your soul … that’s the territory of 
fiction.”

Rin, an Iraq veteran, Naema, 

a doctor who fled Iraq with her 
wounded son and Beth, a wife 
whose husband is deployed in 
Afghanistan, 
represent 
female 

viewpoints from three different 
conditions of war experience. After 

a hurricane devastates their small 
upstate New York community, the 
events that follow expose the ways 
that war has affected these women 
and their community.

In the fictitious domain of 

“Wolf Season,” the story of these 
three women communicate the 
emotions and experiences of war 
that real people can’t –– the kinds of 
feelings and memories that caused 
Benedict’s interviewees to fall 
silent.

“If we read fiction that takes 

us deep into their hearts … we 
understand them the way we 
understand 
friends,” 
Benedict 

explained.

It is in this way that Benedict 

believes that an understanding of 
the havoc war wreaks on the human 
heart can be made more accessible 

for those to whom 
the effects of war 
are less visible in 
everyday life.

“It’s an integral 

part of our lives even 
if we don’t realize it,” 
she said.

Benedict 

reminded me that 
we have a say in war, 

too. With our right to vote, we elect 
the politicians who make strategic 
military moves and who approve 
our country’s defense budget, and 
we should be conscious of our voice 
in war.

“The way we react to war is a 

reflection of who we are in many 
deeper ways,” Benedict said. “War 

is so dramatic and so awful … it 
really exposes the human heart, 
and it exposes our morality in a 
way that almost nothing else does 
… In the end it’s not about war, it’s 
about human beings, what it is to be 
human and what it is to be moral.”

The best way to make moral 

choices is to understand the 
experiences of others. And fictional 
literature like “Wolf Season” can 
take us to a heightened level of 
understanding about the experience 
of war.

 Led by its senior class, 

the Michigan field hockey 
team secured the Big Ten 

Tournament title to complete 
an elusive conference sweep.

Sophomore VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson broke out in a big 
way against the Golden 
Gophers, showing why he 
was picked to replace Jabrill 
Peppers.

Football doesn’t need to be 

calculus. 

It can be as simple as rock, 

paper, 
scissors. 
Saturday 

night, it didn’t matter that 
Michigan 
was 
missing 
its 

starting right guard, its second-
string running back or its best 
blocking tight end. It didn’t 
matter that the Wolverines 
hardly alternated their play-
calls. 

Michigan kept throwing rock 

— and promptly bludgeoned 
Minnesota into submission.

“I felt like maybe we were 

playing on our heels and didn’t 
hit them in the mouth first,” 
said 
Minnesota 
linebacker 

Blake Cashman. “If we would 
have done that, who knows 
what would have happened.”

Just 
last 
week, 
the 

Wolverines churned out 334 
yards on 51 carries against 
Rutgers. That was a season 
high. It took just under three 
quarters against the Golden 
Gophers to smash that number. 
With sacks removed, Michigan 
finished with 34 carries for 394 
yards and four touchdowns. 
Karan Higdon toted the ball 16 
times for 200 yards, finding the 
end zone twice. His teammate, 
Chris Evans, tacked on 13 
carries for 191 yards and two 
scores of his own.

It was the type of performance 

one might have expected from 
a vintage Jim Harbaugh team 
during his Stanford years, and 
proof that Michigan’s offense 
continues to take a step in the 
right direction.

“Yeah, (the run game has) 

just gotten a little bit better 
and better,” said Jim Harbaugh 
after the game. “Good precision 
there. I think the backs are 

doing a really good job of 
making the blocks right. That 
was my impression watching 
the tape last week and tonight. 

“The 
way 
they’re 
seeing 

things and cutting and making 
the blocks right, it’s impressive, 
and they’ve been breaking out.”

In 
contrast 
to 
whatever 

Michigan was running earlier 
this season — an ineffective 
potpourri of gap-blocking and 
inside zone schemes — the 
Wolverines have found what 
they’re good at.

Powers 
and 
counters: 
as 

simple as bread and butter, 
and just as crowd-pleasingly 
effective. 

“I mean, we’re just running 

what works, I think,” said 
sophomore 
tight 
end 
Sean 

McKeon. “We got some zone 
plays in there too besides the 
powers and counters, but that’s 
what’s working for us right 
now, out of two tight ends and a 

fullback, so I think that’s what 
we’re going to stick with.”

Earlier in the season, Jack 

Harbaugh asked his son why 
he wasn’t running the counter 
more. The question from the 
former coach clearly worked. 
The play has been a staple 
of Michigan’s offense since 
the Indiana game, and it was 
the call on Higdon’s 77-yard 
touchdown in the first quarter 
Saturday — a play that featured 
picture-perfect execution.

Minnesota’s 
linebackers 

were clearly thrown off by 
the misdirection. Left guard 
Ben Bredeson pulled, blasting 
a 
defensive 
end. 
Fullback 

Khalid Hill followed into the 
breach, 
lowering 
his 
head 

into a linebacker. Higdon saw 
daylight, turned on the jets and 
did the rest.

There 
were 
times 
when 

the 
backs 
made 
something 

out of nothing, too. Midway 

through the second quarter, 
the Wolverines ran power after 
three consecutive counters that 
gained one, 12 and 18 yards. 

It looked like Evans would 

be tackled after a three or four-
yard gain. But he shrugged one 
tackle, stiff-armed another and 
outran the rest for a 60-yard 
touchdown. 

“They were really good, and 

they broke a lot of tackles,” 
Cashman said. “I think that’s 
what ultimately hurt us, we 
couldn’t execute on tackling.”

On that play, Evans made his 

offensive line look good. On 
many others, they helped him 
and Higdon look good. That’s 
what a finely-tuned rushing 
attack looks like — both groups 
working in tandem to run 
the ball down the opponent’s 
throat, picking up the slack 
when 
needed. 
And 
while 

McKeon said he feels like the 
run game has been his team’s 

bread and butter “for a while 
now,” Michigan certainly hasn’t 
put back-to-back performances 
together like that in a long, long 
time. 

1975, in fact, was the last 

time 
the 
Wolverines 
had 

two running backs with over 
100 rushing yards each in 
consecutive games.

“You got to give a lot of 

credit,” 
said 
Minnesota 

coach P.J. Fleck. “They were 
efficient.”

Of course, Michigan doesn’t 

have 
Andrew 
Luck 
under 

center. But Minnesota — and 
Rutgers — knew that too, and 
still couldn’t stop what was 
coming. And, as Michigan’s 
starting tight end brought up, 
there was no need to throw 
when his team was averaging 10 
yards and a cloud of dust. 

“If you’re running the ball 

like that,” McKeon said, “why 
would you do anything else?”

Hudson highlights ‘M’ defense

Khaleke Hudson has always 

looked up to Jabrill Peppers. 
Before Peppers — a first-team All-
American and first-round NFL 
Draftee — went to the pros, Hudson 
would study him from the sideline.

“You want to play like players 

that play like (Peppers),” said 
Michigan’s sophomore VIPER. “I 
feel that he had a big impact on the 
way I’m playing this year.”

Hudson headlined Michigan’s 

defense with one big play after 
another. There was the nearly 
blocked punt, the forced intentional 
grounding and the forced fumble 
— just to mention three of them. 
With plays like that, Hudson led the 
Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 7-2 overall) 
in a 33-10 win over Minnesota. 

He finished with 13 tackles, two 

sacks, six and a half tackles-for-loss 
and one forced fumble. Wherever 
the Golden Gophers (1-5, 4-5) tried 
to move the ball, Hudson was there.

He was there to sack quarterback 

Demry Croft, and he was there 
to contain running back Rodney 
Smith. Saturday night, he had the 
best game of his career.

While he called Peppers a 

“fearless player” after the game, not 
even the illustrious Peppers ever 
had a defensive performance like 
Hudson did Saturday night.

“On 
each 
play 
(defensive 

coordinator Don Brown) gave us, 
we were just executing it, and it just 
happened that I was in the backfield 
every time,” Hudson said. “They 
were throwing a zone read type 
of scheme, and I was just in the 
backfield disrupting it.”

His best play, according to junior 

safety Tyree Kinnel, came in the 
third quarter. Croft stepped up in 
the pocket for the Golden Gophers, 
then scrambled to the right. Hudson 
pursued, and slashed at his arm to 
knock the ball loose.

“I was coming behind him,” 

Hudson said. “I’d just seen it the 
whole time, so I went for it, and (the 
ball) came out.”

Added Kinnel: “He got the 

game ball for the defense. … The 
opportunity came, and he ate with 
it. He was definitely a ‘dude’ tonight, 
as coach Brown would say.”

The fumble, which Hudson 

forced and redshirt junior defensive 
end Chase Winovich recovered, 
was a turning point for the defense. 
Brown 
always 
preaches 
that 

when Michigan gets up on the 
scoreboard, it’s the defense’s job to 
keep opponents down.

Hudson’s forced fumble did just 

that. The Gophers totaled just 164 
yards of offense, and didn’t reach 
the end zone again after their 
second drive of the first quarter.

Michigan’s new VIPER played a 

big part in that.

One of the Hudson’s most 

memorable plays, though, came on 
one of the only times he didn’t make 
the tackle.

Late in the second quarter, 

Minnesota lined up to punt. Hudson 
burst toward the punter but arrived 
too soon. He jumped early, and 
Minnesota punter Ryan Santoso 
hadn’t even let go of the ball yet. 
Hudson flew by, and the punt sailed 
away successfully.

“I should’ve kept my eyes on the 

ball,” Hudson said and laughed. “I 
jumped straight up in the air instead 
of jumping at his foot. (Special 
teams coordinator Chris) Partridge 
is probably going to get after me 
about that.”

While Hudson didn’t get the 

blocked punt, he continued to show 
what he had all game.

“What 
a 
game,” 
Harbaugh 

said. “What a game. Spectacular 
performance by Khaleke Hudson. 
… Looked like he was everywhere. 
His strong hands really showed up 
in this game. He was everywhere 
he was supposed to be and making 
sure tackles. Works extremely hard 
and great to see it pay off.”

Everyone saw last year what 

Peppers was able to do in the VIPER 
position, and now that Hudson has 
had a half a season to settle in, he’s 
looking more and more like his 
predecessor.

“(Peppers) was making plays 

every week,” Kinnel said. “Now 
everyone got to see Khaleke do it.”

Worth the wait

M

ost teams only 
experience the 
thrill of winning a 

championship 
once, if at all. 

Placing hats 

around their 
ponytails, 
pulling t-shirts 
over their 
uniforms, 
and lifting a 
trophy above 
their heads 
— these are 
the moments 
athletes wait for their whole 
careers. For some, the wait never 
ends.

The Michigan field hockey 

team has six seniors and fifth-year 
seniors who could have suffered 
that fate. But the Wolverines made 
sure their final year would be 
worth the wait.

Michigan won the Big Ten and 

the Big Ten Tournament for the 
first time since 2010. Once the 
Wolverines caught a glimpse that 
their dream season could come 
true, they made sure that it did. 

“We were all like, ‘You guys, 

this is a championship team. We 
can do this,’” said fifth-year senior 
Carly Bennett. “That just fueled us 
tremendously, knowing not only 
that this is our last year, but this 
is our last year and we have all of 
the tools to win. So it was a perfect 
combination.”

Added senior Katie Trombetta: 

“There definitely was something 
magical about this (team) ... I’m 
just so glad we took that feeling 
and ran with it.”

***
From the very beginning, they 

knew they had potential. In the 
ACC/Big Ten Challenge, Michigan 
started its season with one-goal 
victories over then-No. 1 North 
Carolina and then-No. 15 Wake 
Forest. Between their senior 
leadership and freshman talent, 
the Wolverines knew they could 
be special.

But the next week, Michigan 

dropped two games to then-No. 4 

Connecticut and then-unranked 
William and Mary. Suddenly, the 
Wolverines knew they hadn’t found 
their rhythm yet. That could have 
deterred them. They didn’t let it.

“What makes this team 

different from all the rest that 
we’ve been on is just the resilience 
that this team has,” Trombetta 
said. “Even during games that 
we may be at a low point … we’re 
constantly just giving it our all.”

That week taught Michigan an 

important lesson. It may have had 
the personnel to be successful, but 
it needed to have the composure to 
focus on one game at a time.

For the following 16 games, 

that’s exactly what the Wolverines 
did. They haven’t lost a single one 
of those games.

Each game built upon the 

foundation of the last, and 
as Michigan kept rolling, its 
confidence continued to grow. 

The Wolverines began to grow 
more comfortable in their roles at 
every position and in the lineup 
as a whole. They learned that they 
had to stay in the moment in every 
game, avoiding the temptation to 
get too high or too low.

But then Michigan had to face 

Penn State, which was the No. 2 
team in the country at the time, in 
State College. With two undefeated 
Big Ten records on the line, the 
game could have swung the 
conference one way or the another.

It swung in favor of the 

Wolverines, who came away with 
a 3-0 victory.

“We came out firing on all 

cylinders,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We played 
great top to bottom, left to right, 
and I think that game went so well 
(that) the players were like, ‘Wow 
we can play with anyone in the 
country.’”

Added Bennett: “It was just 

the culmination of everything we 
had been working for. … That was 
the game where everyone was so 
connected.”

With that game in hand, 

Michigan marched through the 
rest of conference play, knowing 
full well what it was capable of. It 
didn’t matter that this year the Big 
Ten has been the most competitive 
Pankratz has seen since she took 
over the helm of the program 
in 1996. That just made it extra 
special.

Two weeks ago, the Wolverines 

faced Northwestern with a chance 
to win the conference outright for 
the first time since 2011. With 10 
minutes left to play, Trombetta 
netted the game-winning goal on 
a direct penalty-corner shot. After 
ricocheting off a Wildcat defender, 
the ball settled into the top of the 
cage.

Call it a lucky bounce if you 

must. But with the number of close 
calls Trombetta and her classmates 
have endured during their 
Michigan careers, you would be 
better off calling it poetic justice. 

Their freshman year, the 

Wolverines lost just two 
conference games, but the second 
knocked them out of the top spot. 
Their sophomore year, they made 
it to the Big Ten Tournament 
championship, but they suffered a 
four-goal defeat. And their junior 
year, Penn State ended another 
conference tournament run.

Perhaps it was only fitting 

then, that Sunday morning, the 
Nittany Lions were the only team 
standing between Michigan and 
an elusive Big Ten conference and 
tournament title sweep.

Even more fitting, it took 

another fortunate break for the 
Wolverines to pull it off.

With just five minutes left in 

the game, Bennett received a pass 
in prime territory and heard fifth-
year senior Esther de Leijer calling 
for it. With a couple of Penn State 
defenders breathing down her 
neck, she sent the ball toward her 
classmate.

Bennett worried that she had 

left it short. But de Leijer found 
her way to it, and with her back to 
the goal, she pulled it into the near 
post. The Nittany Lion goalkeeper, 
who was positioned on the other 
side of the cage, couldn’t make it 
over in time.

With another 1-0 win, Michigan 

won its second title of the season.

“We used our experiences with 

losing in the past years to fuel us 
through,” Bennett said, “and I 
think that translated to the team 
through all the seniors.”

***
The seniors only had one more 

shot at a championship run. After 
falling just short so many times, 
that was all the motivation they 
needed.

Every step of the way, they 

guided the Wolverines in the 
direction they needed to go. And in 
the end, they had the season they 
have imagined since the start of 
the year — and the very beginning 
of their careers.

“There was never a single 

moment where you didn’t feel the 
want or the heart from any of our 
seniors,” Trombetta said. “... We 
brought it to every single practice 
and every team meeting, and 
everyone just fed off of it.”

Added Bennett: “It’s just an 

overwhelming and humbling 
experience, and it really does just 
make you smile the entire time. 
There really aren’t many words to 
describe it all.” 

One hat, one t-shirt and one 

trophy would have been enough. 
But Michigan experienced the 
thrill of winning a championship 
twice.

The good, the bad and the ugly: Minnesota

The 
Michigan 
football 

team, quite literally, ran away 
with this one. 

Karan Higdon and Chris 

Evans combined for 391 yards 
and four touchdowns, three of 
which went for 60-plus yards. 
By the beginning of the fourth 
quarter, the Wolverines led 
33-7, and a Minnesota field 
goal in the waning moments 
provided the final score line.

By 
the 
time 
the 
clock 

finally expired on a game 
that had been determined 
early, Michigan maintained 
its possession of the Little 
Brown Jug. A lot went right to 
get there, but some still went 
wrong.

The Daily breaks down the 

good, the bad and the ugly from 
Saturday night’s rain-delayed 
thrashing of Minnesota:

The good
On 3rd-and-15 from its own 

10-yard line, Minnesota went 
to a play that has plagued the 
Wolverines all year. Running 
back 
Rodney 
Smith 
took 

the ball off the direct snap 
with just over two minutes 
remaining in the third quarter.

He was promptly dropped 

by Khaleke Hudson for a loss 
of three yards. Sophomore 
linebacker 
Devin 
Bush 
Jr. 

proceeded to go for a piggyback 
ride on Hudson’s shoulders, 
tapping his teammate’s helmet 
all the way.

It 
was 
one 
of 
plenty 

celebrations 
for 
Hudson. 

And he had plenty reason to 
celebrate.

Michigan’s 
sophomore 

VIPER wreaked havoc against 
Minnesota, finishing with 13 
tackles — six and a half for 
loss — two sacks and a forced 
fumble.

The 
performance 
nearly 

became one for the record 
books. Instead, Larry Foote’s 
2001 showing against Iowa — 
which included seven tackles-

for-loss — is still standing 
as the most by a Michigan 
player in a single game. And 
with Saturday night’s outing, 
Hudson now leads the Big Ten 
in tackles-for-loss with 12.5.

A new player seems to 

headline 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense every week. This time, 
it was Hudson’s turn.

The bad
It’s been a rough stretch for 

Quinn Nordin.

Michigan’s 
redshirt 

freshman 
kicker 
entered 

Saturday night having missed 
an extra point against Penn 
State and a 37-yard field goal 
against Rutgers in consecutive 
weeks.

Nordin again missed an 

extra 
point 
after 
junior 

running back Karan Higdon’s 
77-yard touchdown run near 
the end of the first quarter, 
before pushing a 49-yard field 
goal wide right before the end 
of the first half.

“We thought he was going 

too fast,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “That’s what 

we noticed last week and 
then in practice this week, we 
thought we had that corrected. 
I think we did correct it.

“(On) the missed extra point 

he looked up too early, and he 
got his left hip in front of his 
right too much and pulled it 
left. I thought the long field 
goal, the 49-yarder, was a 
good hit, it just went a bit wide 
right. Just keep working on it.”

It’s hard to criticize Nordin 

for the missed field goal, but 
what once seemed like all but 
a guaranteed source for points 
is now far less certain.

Nordin has now made 14 of 

his 18 field goals on the year 
but has failed to convert on his 
two attempts in the last three 
games.

The ugly
With just under 10 minutes 

remaining in the third quarter, 
Brandon Peters lined up under 
center facing a 3rd-and-4 from 
Michigan’s 29-yard line.

He 
took 
the 
snap 
and 

dropped 
back 
into 
the 

pocket, only to have Merrick 

Jackson fly — unchecked by 
freshman right guard Cesar 
Ruiz — into the backfield. 
Merrick had a free shot at 
Michigan’s redshirt freshman 
quarterback, and he took it.

Peters absorbed a crushing 

hit, one that left him lying on 
the turf for roughly 20 seconds 
before walking off the field.

For 
all 
the 
success 

Michigan’s offensive line had 
in sparking the run game — 
the Wolverines rushed for 371 
yards and averaged 10 yards 
per carry — its pass protection 
left something to be desired, 
to say the least. Peters was 
sacked three times for a loss 
of 23 yards against the Golden 
Gophers, including another 
straight-on, bruising hit in the 
third quarter.

If 
the 
matchup 
with 

Minnesota 
showed 

anything, 
it’s 
that 
Peters 

is 
now 
unquestionably 

the Wolverines’ starter. If 
Michigan wants it to stay that 
way, hits like Saturday night’s 
can only go on for so long.

Redshirt freshman kicker Quinn Nordin continued his struggles, missing an extra point and a field goal Saturday night.

Five Things We Learned: Minnesota

For 
the 
second 
straight 

week, the Michigan football 
team (4-2 Big Ten, 7-2 overall) 
claimed 
a 
comfortable 
win 

against an inferior opponent. 
The run game surged and the 
defense locked down the Golden 
Gophers (1-5, 4-5). 

Here are five things The 

Daily learned from the battle for 
the Little Brown Jug.

1. 
Peters 
may 
be 
the 

quarterback, but the running 
backs are the offense

In Brandon Peters’ first start 

at quarterback, the redshirt 
freshman threw the ball just 
13 times. He completed 61 
percent of his passes and threw 
his second career touchdown 
to sophomore tight end Sean 
McKeon on the opening drive. 
After that set, Peters was quiet, 
mainly 
because 
Michigan’s 

running backs kept breaking 
free for long runs.

Junior 
Karan 
Higdon 

and sophomore Chris Evans 
combined 
for 
391 
rushing 

yards, and each scored two 
touchdowns.

Higdon’s 
performance 

marked his second 200-yard 
game and his third game with 

multiple touchdowns. Evans, 
on the other hand, had been 
quiet in recent weeks since his 
two-touchdown outing against 
Purdue.

But with fifth-year senior 

running back Ty Isaac out due 
to injury this week, coach Jim 
Harbaugh decided to give Evans 
more carries. For Michigan, 
that move paid off.

2. Michigan’s defense has 

figured out the direct snap

While the play haunted the 

Wolverines against Penn State 
and Rutgers, Minnesota found 
little success.

On 
Minnesota’s 
only 

touchdown drive — its second 
drive of the game — quarterback 
Demry 
Croft 
shifted 
in 

formation and running back 
Rodney Smith received a direct 
snap. He rushed forward for a 
short gain of just two yards. His 
results didn’t get much better 
from there.

To put that in perspective, 

the last two opponents to take 
direct snaps against Michigan — 
Penn State’s Saquon Barkley and 
Rutgers’ Janarion Smith — ran 
for 60-plus-yard touchdowns.

The 
Golden 
Gophers 

occasionally snapped the ball 
directly to Smith, but he couldn’t 
break loose for big plays. Smith 

is the team’s leading rusher and 
averages 78 yards per game on 
the ground. Against Michigan, 
though, he ran for just 38 yards.

Michigan 
handled 
every 

other type of snap just as well, 
shutting Minnesota out of the 
end zone after the second drive 
of the game and allowing just 36 
yards in the second half.

3. Cesar Ruiz is a solid 

replacement at right guard

With sophomore right guard 

Mike Onwenu out with an 
apparent foot injury, the true 
freshman Cesar Ruiz earned his 
first start.

Ruiz helped the Wolverines’ 

offensive line open lanes for the 
running backs time and time 
again. There was a bit of cause 
for concern in pass protection — 
Peters was sacked three times — 
but as a whole, the offensive line 
also allowed just five tackles for 
loss.

Harbaugh said after the game 

that he thought Ruiz played 
“really well,” and spoke about 
Ruiz in a similar way Saturday 
that he spoke about Peters a 
week before.

The young player had been 

competing well in practice, and 
it was simply “time for him to 
play.”

4. 
McKeon 
is 
Peters’ 

favorite target

After the win, McKeon joked 

that he was angry with his new 
quarterback.

On a pass play where McKeon 

was wide open, Peters took a 
hard sack.

“He’s a tough guy, I knew 

he was going to be fine. I was 
just mad cause I was open on 
a crossing route for the first 
down,” McKeon said with a 
laugh.

The 
Peters-to-McKeon 

connection has proved to be 
one of the most effective for 
the Wolverines’ offense. For the 
second week in a row, McKeon 
led Michigan in receiving yards. 
He caught three catches for 
30 yards and one touchdown 
against Minnesota, and last 
week 
against 
Rutgers 
he 

caught three for 31. While 
the traditional wide receivers 
have had less of an impact, the 
offense is still finding ways to 
score on the ground.

If push comes to shove 

and 
Higdon’s 
and 
Evans’ 

contributions lessen, it appears 
Peters still has a top option in 
McKeon.

5. Prediction: Peters will 

probably get more throws 
against Maryland

In evaluating his redshirt 

freshman 
quarterback, 

Harbaugh 
admitted 
that 

there 
weren’t 
very 
many 

opportunities 
for 
Peters 
to 

throw. He only threw the ball 
just 13 times.

When Higdon and Evans 

run for 60-yard touchdowns 
on every drive, not only does 
Peters not need to throw, but he 
also doesn’t get to throw. The 
lack of passing activity made 
it difficult for Michigan’s new 
starter to get into a rhythm, and 
Harbaugh also said he will do 
more to keep Peters active on 
the sideline.

While the Terrapins don’t 

present much of a challenge 
to Michigan’s run game, the 
future opponents — Wisconsin 
and Ohio State — likely will. It 
could be vital to get Peters more 
chances to throw next week 
before asking him to do so on a 
bigger stage.

MEN’S SOCCER
Hallahan leads attack 

Ten minutes into the second 

half 
of 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

soccer team’s first ever home 
Big Ten Tournament game, star 
sophomore winger Jack Hallahan 
collected the ball on the edge of the 
18-yard-box. The Wolverines were 
knotted at one with Northwestern. 
He took one look at goal before 
cutting onto his dangerous left foot 
and unleashing a ferocious curler 
within inches of both the post and 
crossbar, past the flailing Wildcat 
goalie. 

The goal gave Michigan a 2-1 

lead that it would not relinquish, 
eventually turning it into a 4-1 final 
to book its place in the conference 
semifinals for the first time since 
2012. Part of that success can be 
attributed to Hallahan’s elevated 
play.

The game-winner was a piece 

of solo magic from Hallahan, 
but the rest of the Wolverines’ 
dominant 
performance 
came 

through a balanced attack that saw 
five players tally either a goal or 
an assist, including a second from 
Hallahan.

Leading this attack was junior 

striker Francis Atuahene, who 
scored the opening goal before 
assisting both of Hallahan’s. This 
combination has become crucial 
down the stretch for Michigan, 
as it was Hallahan’s inch-perfect 
cross that found Atuahene for his 
historic goal against Maryland last 
week to give Michigan its regular 
season conference title.

“They’re two talented young 

players. If we can get the ball to 
them in the right spots on the 
field,” said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley, “they can certainly make 
things happen on their own. But 
when they’re working collectively, 
they become a bigger danger to 
opponents.”

“In training, coaches put us 

together a lot,” Hallahan said, “ … 
We’ve built a really good bond on 
and off the field.”

For the Wolverines to continue 

their dream season, though, they 
will need continued contributions 
beyond these two stars. After all, 
their focus on working together 
has been what has put them in this 

position, and it is what they used 
to collect themselves and ensure a 
focused performance after a week 
of celebrating their first conference 
championship.

“We wanted them to enjoy it for 

a few days because they earned it 
but we wanted to get back down 
to business,” Daley said. “The 
foundation of our team was … about 
sticking together, working hard for 
each other, and competing for the 
team and competing for Michigan.”

This attitude shone through in 

Sunday’s match, as it was senior 
defender Billy Stevens — who 
had tallied just four assists in 
69 previous career matches — 
assisted the opening goal. Junior 
defender Marcelo Borges followed 
up with his sixth career assist on 
Michigan’s third goal, which was 
scored by junior midfielder Robbie 
Mertz for his first conference 
goal since a Sept. 13 draw against 
Indiana.

Daley went beyond his goal-

scorers 
to 
praise 
freshman 

midfielder Umar Farouk Osman for 
the team’s second-half turnaround.

“The game changed a little bit 

when Umar went in centrally,” 
Daley said. “Umar hasn’t got any 
goals this year but when he’s played 
centrally, he’s really made a lot of 
things happen and him stretching 
the field gives a lot of other guys 
opportunities. If three or four guys 
are cooking, you don’t know which 
one you’re gonna get.”

But while the Wolverines may 

boast a total-effort mentality, 
their success will ultimately come 
back to Hallahan, who scored his 
second from a nearly impossible 
angle in the final minutes to cap off 
the evening.

“When I cut in for the second 

goal, I saw the net open and 
I thought, ‘Why not try it?’” 
Hallahan said.

This willingness to try things, 

which 
the 
British 
Hallahan 

credits to his seven years in West 
Bromwich Albion’s youth academy, 
has helped him to his breakout 
season, in which he has scored 
seven goals to go along with seven 
assists — both team bests.

And with Hallahan leading a 

balanced attack, the Wolverines 
don’t look like settling for what 
they’ve already accomplished.

MEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ tops Northwestern

A five-hour delay resulted in a 6 

p.m. kick off for the Michigan men’s 
soccer team, but an under the lights 
matchup at U-M Soccer stadium was 
the perfect environment for a squad 
that looked anything but sluggish.

Michigan faced Northwestern 

on Sunday night in the Big Ten 
tournament 
quarterfinals 
and 

earned a 4-1 win.

Despite having played the day 

before, the Wildcats (1-8-0 Big Ten, 
6-11-0 overall) came out with more 
energy than Michigan (7-1-1, 12-4-
2). Northwestern put considerable 
pressure on the Wolverines and 
forced errant passes from the 
Michigan defense. While Michigan 
reestablished 
themselves 
going 

forward and did manage to earn a few 
set pieces, the Wildcats registered the 
only shot on goal through the first 15 
minutes.

But in the 23rd minute, junior 

forward Francis Atuahene netted his 
sixth goal of the season.

Atuahene capitalized on a long 

throw from senior right back Billy 
Stevens. Stevens’ throw managed to 
evade every player in the box until 
Atuahene pounced on it at the back 
post. His low, powerful shot gave the 
Northwestern goalkeeper no chance 
as the Wolverines took a 1-0 lead.

Northwestern responded well 

after the goal and came very close 
to equalizing off a pre-planned set 
piece, sending the ball just wide of 
the Michigan goal post. Through 30 
minutes, the shots were tied at five 
and each team registered two shots 
on goal.

The Wildcats had set piece after 

set piece and dominated the run of 
play heading into halftime, but the 
Wolverines were able to hold on to 
their slim 1-0 lead.

“We weren’t playing according 

to what we wanted to do,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. “We 
were more aggressive in the second 
half and more competitive. It resulted 
in four goals because we had them a 
little more stretched.”

Northwestern came out riding 

the momentum they gained toward 
the end of the first half and equalized 
five minutes into the second. A 
clearance from the Michigan defense 
off a free kick was kicked back in 
the 18-yard box by the Wildcats. 
Midfielder Tommy Katsyiannis fired 
a well-placed shot to the far post to 
beat freshman goalkeeper Henry 
Mashburn and tie the game at one.

Northwestern’s 
confidence 

seemed to grow until, against the run 
of play, the Wolverines regained the 
lead. A good tackle from a Wildcats 
defender sent the ball to the feet of 
sophomore forward Jack Hallahan. 
Hallahan took a touch and curled a 
ball from the right side of the 18-yard 
box to the far post. Northwestern’s 
goalkeeper didnt have a chance, and 
Hallahan had a wonder goal to his 
name.

And after retaking the lead, 

Michigan never looked back.

Eighteen minutes into the half, 

a long ball from junior defender 
Marcello Borges was brought down 
excellently by junior midfielder 
Robbie Mertz, who deftly finished 
the move with a left-footed shot back 
across goal to extend the Michigan 
lead to 3-1.

And with 11 minutes left, Hallahan 

tallied another. A well-weighted, 
cross-field pass from Atuahene sent 
Hallahan all the way to the goal 
line where the sophomore calmly 
dribbled into the box and slotted the 
ball into the back of the net.

“I think after the first goal I was 

really starting to feel confident,” 
Hallahan said. “When I cut in for the 
second goal I saw the net open, and I 
thought, ‘Why not try it?’”

And 
really, 
Hallahan’s 
why 

not approach Sunday night could 
summarize the Wolverines’ season. 
The team has already won the 
regular season title and that’s given 
them the confidence to go for more. 
And for once Michigan is controlling 
its own postseason destiny.

“I think now that we’ve won 

the Big Ten we know we have the 
potential to win a lot more,” Hallahan 
said. “We’re going to really go for it 
and we’re going to see what we can 
do as a group.”

Michigan completes shutout,
captures B1G Tournament title

For the Michigan field hockey 

team, it’s been a storybook season.

A rough first few games turned 

into a 15-game winning streak, a 
regular season title and a berth in the 
Big Ten Tournament final. And with 
a 1-0 win over Penn State to secure 
the championship, the Wolverines 
proved that this story has a happy 
ending.

Things didn’t start out so well for 

Michigan. The usually-dominant 
defense struggled to keep the ball out 
of its own territory, as the Nittany 
Lions outshot the Wolverines 7-1 in 
the first half. But senior goalkeeper 
Sam Swenson, who was named Big 
Ten Defensive Player of the Year, 
made several impressive saves to 
keep the game scoreless.

“I saw our senior captain leader,” 

Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz 
said of Swenson. “In the biggest 
game she came up with the biggest 
saves.”

Neither team converted the 

opportunities they had in the first 
half, giving the Wolverines an 
opportunity to reset. During the 
break, the team huddled as senior 
midfielder Katie Trombetta mapped 

out plays on a whiteboard.

“When we got to the second 

half, we made an adjustment and 
weathered some emotion from Penn 
State,” Pankratz said. “(We) played a 
little bit bigger ball at the back.”

The 
adjustment 
paid 
off, 

as Michigan was able to more 
consistently keep possession, taking 
nine shots to the Nittany Lions’ 
eight.

It was a full team effort. On one 

play, Swenson made a save on a 
Penn State shot but fell, leaving the 
goal open. The Nittany Lions got a 
rebound, but freshman midfielder 
Kayla Reed was there to block the 
shot and buy Swenson some time.

“(You’ve) gotta take every shot as 

it comes, play minute for minute,” 
Swenson said. “My defense was 
really great in front of me.”

With just over five minutes left 

in the game, Michigan got a free hit 
and took the ball up the field. While 
fifth-year senior forward Carly 
Bennett’s shot was saved, fifth-year 
senior midfielder Esther de Leijer 
was set up perfectly to score off the 
rebound.

In a match against Louisville the 

last week of the regular season, de 
Leijer broke her hand, but she didn’t 
let that stop her. She played with a 

brace on her hand, pushing through 
the soreness.

“There was never a doubt (that 

she was going to play) because it’s 
the Big Ten Tournament,” Pankratz 
said. “Esther is super tough. Nothing 
was gonna keep her out of that 
game.”

Scoring the first goal took some of 

the pressure off. Still, the Wolverines 
knew they couldn’t let up.

“We just knew that we had to 

keep it clean in the backfield,” de 
Leijer said, “and no matter what, 
play really hard until the end.”

But no good story is complete 

without a little drama of the end. 
In this game, that came in the form 
of back-to-back corners from the 
Nittany Lions just as time expired.

Penn State’s last shot looked like it 

had a chance to go in on a rebound, 
but the attempt was blocked and 
Michigan had its victory, becoming 
Big Ten Tournament champions for 
the first time since 2010. The win 
ensures the Wolverines an automatic 
berth to the NCAA Tournament, 
where they could contend for an 
even bigger title.

“I’m just really happy for our 

players,” Pankratz said. “They’ve 
worked incredibly hard to get 
Michigan back to being champions.”

A tale of two night games
O

n the first Saturday 
of October, Michigan 
was in a state of 

emergency.

At the same time of night, 

under the 
same rainy 
Ann Arbor 
sky, the 
Wolverines 
fell 14-10 
to then-
unranked 
Michigan 
State. It 
was only 
one loss, 
but it seemed to tell the tale of 
their season.

Amid a torrential 

downpour, they didn’t run the 
ball when they should have, 
they tried to force passes 
when they weren’t there and 
they turned the ball over when 
they couldn’t afford to.

For a Michigan team 

that had played better than 
expected to that point of the 
season, that game showed the 
Wolverines weren’t quite there 
yet.

But on the first Saturday of 

November, Michigan wrote 
a different tale, putting the 
pieces together in a 33-10 win 
over Minnesota.

As a thunderstorm 

descended upon Michigan 
Stadium an hour before 
kickoff, weather could have 
been a factor blamed for 
the outcome of the game. It 
had been on that October 
night, as fifth-year senior 
quarterback John O’Korn 
threw an interception on three 
consecutive drives.

The Wolverines didn’t 

have to play in the rain in 
November, though. Even if 
they did, this time, they would 
have been prepared.

It all started with the 

running game, which has 
experienced its fair share of 
ups-and-downs this season. 
Its performance against the 
Spartans was certainly one 
of those downs. Junior Karan 
Higdon and sophomore Chris 
Evans combined for just 92 
yards and failed to find the 

end zone. Fifth-year senior 
Ty Isaac, the third member 
of that rotation, let a game-
changing fumble fall out of his 
grasp and sat on the bench for 
much of the rest of the night.

But against Minnesota, 

the ground game set the tone 
early and often, bursting 
through and running laps 
around the Golden Gophers’ 
defense. Higdon and Evans 
had arguably their best game 
of the year as individuals. 
Together, Michigan 
undoubtedly had its best.

Higdon ran for 200 yards 

and two touchdowns. Evans 
came close with 191 yards and 
two touchdowns of his own. 
And they weren’t easy scores, 
either. The duo just made 
them look easy.

Minnesota had no answers 

for the duo’s combination of 
power and speed — Higdon the 
former and Evans the latter. 
Higdon busted out a 77-yard 
touchdown and then dragged 
a defender five yards into the 
end zone for another. Evans 
broke free on similar plays, 
leaving everyone in the dust 
on 60 and 67-yard runs.

“Karan and Chris had 

spectacular runs,” said 
Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “... We kept feeding 
the running game. It was 
working.”

The two had plenty of help 

along the way. In a night-and-
day difference from where 
the unit was a month ago, 
the offensive line made its 
presence felt, setting up each 
of those big plays.

The Golden Gophers 

couldn’t match the 
Wolverines’ physicality at 
the line of scrimmage, as 
Michigan’s offensive line 
opened up gaping holes and 
allowed Higdon and Evans to 
explode. 

“That was a game for the 

ages if you’re an offensive 
lineman,” Harbaugh said.

While the ground game 

gained a season-high 371 
yards, redshirt freshman 
quarterback Brandon Peters 
— O’Korn’s replacement — 

didn’t have all that much 
to do. In his first collegiate 
start, the Wolverines could 
have tried to make it all about 
him, designing a game plan 
centered on the passing game.

But they prioritized 

the passing game against 
Michigan State, and it 
didn’t end well. They had no 
intention of making that same 
mistake against Minnesota.

“We were running the ball 

so well, I think 10 yards a 
rush per attempt,” Harbaugh 
said. “... I’m sure if we did it 
any other way, you would’ve 
thought, ‘Why didn’t we run 
the ball more?’”

Peters did enough with the 

opportunities he was given, 
leading a scoring drive on 
Michigan’s first offensive 
series that was capped off by 
a 20-yard throwback screen 
pass to sophomore tight end 
Sean McKeon.

And he never gave up 

possession of the football, 
even when faced with heavy 
pressure on three sacks. With 
free runners bearing down 
on his blind side, Peters had 
the wherewithal to sense 
the danger and tuck the ball 
into his chest to prevent a 
strip sack. That was all the 
Wolverines needed him to do.

With a dependable ground 

game, a competent line 
and a steady quarterback, 
Michigan’s offense showed 
more life than it has all 
season. For a Wolverine team 
that has allowed its defense 
to carry much of the load, 
Saturday night showed that 
the offense can do the same.

It may have come an hour 

late, but Saturday night, the 
game Michigan has been 
waiting for finally arrived.

The Wolverines may have 

lost the Paul Bunyan Trophy, 
but they retained the Little 
Brown Jug. And in doing so, 
Michigan demonstrated that 
the story of its season hasn’t 
been fully written yet.
