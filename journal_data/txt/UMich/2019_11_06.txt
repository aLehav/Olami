Editor’s Note: The Michigan 
Daily has used several anonymous 
sources to report this story. 
As stated in the article, we are 
honoring our sources’ requests 
to be quoted anonymously due 
to fears of retaliation from their 
fraternity brothers or the greater 
fraternity 
and 
sorority 
life 
community for speaking out. In 
accordance with our ethics policy 
(which can be found in full in our 
bylaws), the reporter of this article 
and two editors have seen the 
names and fraternity affiliations of 
our sources, as well as the evidence 
they provided The Daily. 
Fraternities 
affiliated 
with 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
have engaged in recruitment of 
freshmen 
members 
this 
semester 
against 
University of 
Michigan 
policy, 
a 

Michigan Daily investigation has 
discovered.
The IFC is a governing body 
for most fraternities overseen 
by the University. The Daily has 
confirmed at least eight out of 
the 18 IFC-affiliated fraternities 
invited freshmen to participate 
in 
the 
recruitment 
process, 
extended bids to freshmen or 
currently have freshmen pledges. 
Though all sources quoted in the 
article told The Daily they believe 
every IFC-affiliated fraternity 
conducted fall recruitment of 
freshmen students, The Daily 
could not independently confirm 
this information. 
The Daily was also given 
documentation showing at least 
one 
IFC-affiliated 
fraternity 
used 
freshmen 
pledges 
as 
sober monitors for at least one 
party, despite the fact these 
freshmen 
students 
did 
not 
receive the required University-
administered 
training to serve 
in this capacity. 
The 
IFC 
is 
one 
of 
four 
fraternity and 
sorority 
life 
councils 
at 
the University. 
The Daily has 
received 
no 

confirmation any organizations 
within the other three councils — 
the Panhellenic Association, the 
Multicultural Greek Council and 
the National Panhellenic Council 
— engaged in fall recruitment 
of freshmen students. The Ann 
Arbor Interfraternity Council, 
a group of fraternities that 
disaffiliated from the University 
last fall, does not fall under 
the University’s 
jurisdiction. 
Because they are not beholden 
to the deferred rush policy, 
these fraternities were free 
to openly recruit first-year 
students. 
The six students interviewed 
in this article have requested 
anonymity for fear of retaliation 
from the fraternity community. 
To protect the identities of these 
sources and their safety on 
campus, The Daily has decided 
not to publish the names of 
the fraternities linked to the 
evidence it has received nor 
the evidence itself.
A freshman pledging an 
IFC-affiliated 
fraternity, 
who will be referred 
to as Student 1 in this 
article, shared with The 
Daily an email that was 
sent to him about “pledge 
education.” 
Because 
freshmen 
rushees 
and 
pledges are not registered 

within and thus not recognized 
in the University’s fraternity 
and sorority life system, Student 
1 said there would be no way 
for a freshman student who felt 
uncomfortable or unsafe to file a 
complaint or incident report. 
It would also be difficult to 
hold those responsible for harm 
within the fraternity accountable, 
Student 1 explained. 
“The University has no idea 
I’m pledging, they have no record 
of it,” Student 1 said. “I mean, 
officially they don’t have my 
name down. And if I die, now it is 
harder for them to prove that it’s 
because of a hazing incident.”
“With any new policy enacted, 
implementation takes time to 
perfect”
In March 2018, University 
administration 
decided 
to 
transition to deferred recruitment 
for freshmen students beginning 
in the 2019-2020 school year. 
All 
students 
eligible 
to 
participate 
in 
fraternity 
or 
sorority 
recruitment 
must have completed at 
least 12 credits at the 
University and be in 
good academic and 
behavioral standing. 
The 
change 
came a semester after 
the IFC voluntarily 
suspended 
all 

social activities for two months 
in 2017 to avoid sanctions from 
the 
fraternities’ 
headquarters 
following multiple incidents of 
hazing, drug and alcohol abuse 
and sexual assault. 
Deferred 
recruitment 
was 
part of the University’s five-
year 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
plan 
for 
first-year 
students. The goal of the deferral 
was to enhance the first-year 
experience for students to “create 
opportunities for students to gain 
skills for long-term academic 
success, develop sustainable and 
healthy relationships and engage 
with a diverse living and learning 
community,” 
as 
detailed 
in the Year Two Progress 
Report.
The 
IFC 
and 
the 
Panhellenic 
Association 

denounced the move when it 
was first announced, releasing a 
statement arguing that deferred 
recruitment violates “the right 
of students to freely associated 
[sic] 
and 
freely 
express 
themselves without coercion 
or undue influence from the 
University.” 
In response to The Daily’s 
request 
for 
comment, 
IFC 
President Nicholas Wasik, an LSA 
senior, reiterated the University’s 
existing policies on misconduct 
complaints and sober monitor 
requirements. He wrote in an 
email that the IFC continues to 
work towards ensuring a safe 
experience for all students, 
which includes a zero-
tolerance 
policy 
towards hazing. 
“With any new 
policy 
enacted, 
implementation 
takes 
time 
to 
perfect 
and 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
in 

conjunction with our 
university partners 
are working to carry 
out all our policies 
to the best of our 
ability,” 
Wasik 
wrote.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Young 
Americans 
for 
Freedom 
brought 
Steve 
Forbes, 
the 
chairman 
of 
Forbes Media Company, to the 
Michigan League for a lecture 
titled 
“How 
Free 
College 
and Healthcare will Destroy 
America” Tuesday night. 
YAF, a conservative group on 

campus, has hosted speakers 
such as Ben Shapiro, Dinesh 
D’Souza and Buzz Patterson. 
Before introducing Forbes as 
the keynote speaker, Lincoln 
Ballew, chair of YAF, talked 
about the mission of YAF.
Forbes shared his opinion 
on a range of topics regarding 
government and policy. He 
started 
his 
speech 
about 
capitalism and the historical 

change of American inflation. 
Forbes went on to discuss the 
problem with socialism and 
why he believes it will never 
work in America. 
“Socialism can try, but it 
always wreaks havoc,” Forbes 
said. 
“The 
problem 
with 
socialism is that it tries to 
predict the future. You can’t 
predict the future. Nobody can 
pretend to know the future, 

so stop. Socialism thinks it’s 
predicting the future and that’s 
why it’s stagnant. It never 
worked, even in Europe.” 
When the topic of taxes 
came up, Forbes shared his 
criticisms on the federal tax 
income code. 

Ann Arbor voters approved a 
$1 billion school bond proposal 
on Tuesday. The bond passed 
by a six-point margin, with 
53 percent of voters in favor 
and 46 percent opposed. The 
30-year bond will be used 
to 
make 
improvements 
to 
Ann Arbor Public Schools’ 
infrastructure, sustainability 
and technology.
In the first six years of the 
construction 
window, 
the 
bond will be used to add air 
conditioning, 
LED 
lighting, 
solar power, kitchens, outdoor 
classrooms, 
collaborative 
learning spaces and improved 
security to the schools, in 
addition to constructing the 
two new schools. 
In a statement to The Daily, 
Superintendent Jeanice Kerr 
Swift said the city currently 
has 32 schools, which are 
housed in 35 buildings that 
are an average of 63 years 
old. She said the bond plan 
was 
developed 
by 
various 
stakeholders in the Ann Arbor 
community. 
In 2018, AAPS commissioned 
an independent company to 
conduct a facility condition 
assessment across the district’s 
schools.

Central Student Government 
Assembly discussed the University’s 
sexual misconduct policy, funding 
for student organizations and the 
CSG calendar at their meeting 
Tuesday night. 
The Assembly began with a 
presentation led by Erik Wessel, 
director of the Office of Student 
Conflict resolution and member of 
a task force created by President 
Schlissel to work on the umbrella 
policy for sexual misconduct at 
the University. Wessel was joined 
by Patty Petrowski, University 
associate vice president and deputy 
general counsel, and University 
Title IX coordinator Elizabeth 
Seney. 
An 
external 
review 
of 
University 
sexual 
misconduct 
policies earlier this year resulted 
in recommendations to adopt an 

umbrella policy to address sexual 
misconduct broadly and to revise 
employee and student procedures. 
Following this, Schlissel created 
a task force to implement these 
recommendations. On Oct. 15, they 
released a draft of the policy and 
requested community feedback, 
which they will accept until Nov. 22. 
Wessel summarized the key 
provisions of the drafted policy, 
which defines prohibited conduct 
and responsible employees and 
expands confidential resources on 
campus. It also includes student 
procedures consistent with the 
interim student sexual misconduct 
policy, which has been in effect 
since January and remains under 
review. These procedures offer 
students 
the 
opportunity 
to 
resolve matters either through an 
investigative resolution, consisting 
of an investigation and hearing, 
or an adaptable resolution, a non-
disciplinary approach that must 

be agreed on by both students 
and approved by the Title IX 
coordinator.
“One of the strengths of our 
policy as it’s currently written is that 
our policy doesn’t prescribe just one, 
singular pathway for resolution,” 
Wessel said. “What’s somewhat 
unique here at the University of 
Michigan that isn’t the case at many 
institutions across the country 
is that we have the opportunity 
to engage in an investigatory 
process. That is a very important 
and legitimate process to offer. 
We also have the opportunity to 
offer voluntary, adaptive resolution 
options as well, because we also 
know that the range of needs and 
the range of interests of students 
being expansive is also something 
we’re taking into consideration.”
After presenting the policy draft, 
Wessel called for feedback from 
CSG members. Some members of 
the Assembly expressed concern 
surrounding 
the 
cross-
examination portion of the 
hearing. Wessel clarified the 
policy allows participants to 
choose to attend hearings from 
separate 
locations 
through 
video assisted technology, a 
method that has been chosen 
for 100 percent of cross-
examinations thus far. He added 
if parties mutually agree, the 
cross-examination can occur in 
written form through the chat 
function of BlueJeans, a video 
conferencing platform. 
Patrowski 
also 
explained 
after the Doe v. Baum decision 
required the cross-examination 
component of the investigatory 
resolution, the University filed 
a petition for a rehearing. The 
petition sought to avoid direct 
confrontation between both 
parties by allowing the hearing 
officer to conduct the cross-
examination. 
However, 
the 
petition was denied by the Sixth 
Circuit Court. 
Many members’ questions 
centered 
around 
students’ 
ability to select an adviser for 
support during the hearing 

process. These advisers are silent 
participants who can confer with 
students 
during 
breaks. 
Some 
students worried differences in 
access to legal counsel as advisers 
could 
create 
inequity 
in 
the 
investigative resolution. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sujin 
Kim 
recommended 
the 
University 
provide access to legal counsel for 
all students in order to mitigate 
these concerns. 
“One thing I’ve heard from my 
constituents regarding this issue 
is that people would feel a lot more 
comfortable coming forward and 
saying something if there was some 
form… or some way that students 
could access legal representation, 
even if they personally can’t afford 
it,” Kim said. 
During the executive report, Ben 
Gerstein, CSG president and Public 
Policy 
junior, 
discussed 
CSG’s 
subsidization of 75 Group-X passes 
to increase access to Recreational 
Sports fitness classes. Gerstein 
said CSG has received many 
applications, but there are still some 
passes available. Applications will 
close Nov. 11. 
CSG then discussed a resolution 
to reimburse the Alpha Phi Alpha 
fraternity for money previously 
authorized to fund the group’s 
travel and lodging at a national 
convention over the summer. Due 
to delayed submission of some of 
the information required to process 
reimbursement, 
CSG 
had 
not 
supplied this funding. The resolution 
to supply the funding passed. 
LSA sophomore Sam Braden put 
forth a resolution to allocate funding 
to support The Michigan Gayly, 
an LGBTQ+ student publication. 
Some members expressed concern 
over using legislative discretionary 
funds for a student organization, as 
funding for student organizations 
is usually provided through the 
Student 
Organization 
Funding 
Committee, a subcommittee within 
CSG to which student organizations 
apply for funding.

‘Army’ of students mobilizes to encourage high youth turnout

Nov. 6, 2000

With 
voter 
drives 
on 
campus 
registering 
nearly 
7,000 
students 
in 
the 
past 
year, 
the 
University ranks as one 
of the top three colleges 
nationwide in terms of 
new voter registration.
And with one day left 
until 
the 
polls 
open, 
volunteers 
are 
making 
sure those students turn 
out to cast their ballots.
Efforts by the Michigan 
Student Assembly’s Voice 
Your 
Vote 
commission 
have given the University 

one of the largest student 
voting 
populations 
in 
the country along with 
the University of Oregon 
and 
the 
University 
of 
California at Santa Cruz.
“You 
have 
an 
army 
in 
Ann 
Arbor,” 
said 
YouthVote 2000 deputy 
campaign manager Ryan 
Friedrichs, 
a 
recent 
University 
graduate. 
“Nobody in the country 
is as good as this stuff 
here.”
Voice 
Your 
Vote, 
a 
nonpartisan 
effort 
to 
register students, is out 
to 
make 
sure 
student 

voter 
turnout 
is 
high, 
regardless of who they 
support.
Today 
and 
tomorrow 
teams of volunteers are 
knocking on doors and 
staffing phone banks to 
remind people to vote. 
An MTV tent will be set 
up in the Diag today to 
distribute 
information 
and 
encourage 
voter 
turnout.
Volunteers 
are 
not 
allowed into University 
residence 
halls, 
where 
solicitation is prohibited.
“Thankfully, 
most 
of 
the 
dorms 
are 
polling 

places,” said a Voice Your 
Vote team leader, Michael 
Gold, an LSA sophomore.
YouthVote 
2000, 
a 
nationwide organization 
to 
encourage 
political 
participation 
among 
young 
voters, 
helped 
organize 
and 
provide 
resources for the voter 
registration 
drive 
and 
this week’s events.
Friedrichs said one of 
the goals of YouthVote 
2000 
is 
that 
enough 
people vote this year so 
candidates, 
pay 
more 
attention to the age group 
in 2004.

“Ann Arbor can become 
a model of how to break 
the cycle of neglect of 
this country,” he said. 
Voice Your Vote team 
leader Mike Pearson, an 
Engineering sophomore, 
said he plans to vote for 
Republican 
candidate 
George 
W. 
Bush 
but 
decided 
to 
join 
the 
turnout 
effort 
rather 
than the partisan effort.
“I also felt and do feel 
that if this organization is 
going to be non-partisan, 
it’s 
important 
to 
have 
people from all sides of 
the 
political 
spectrum. 

Voice 
Your 
Vote’s 
remaining 
nonpartisan 
is crucial to its success,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“We’ve 
worked very hard to do 
that, and I think we’ve 
done a good job.”
Volunteers said they are 
mostly 
concerned 
with 
the perception that young 
people are apathetic to 
the political process.
“People 
our 
age 
are 
informed and know what’s 
going on, so they need to 
demonstrate that,” said 
Voice Your Vote volunteer 
Shira 
Tolins, 
an 
LSA 
sophomore.

“In 
addition, 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
has 
encouraged chapters to hold 
events to engage with first 
semester 
students 
to 
allow 
those students to explore the 
community prior to participating 
in winter recruitment, when they 
are eligible. All of the policies 
mentioned above also apply to 
these engagement events.”
“To have a cone of silence 
around an issue is really 
difficult”
The Daily obtained an email 
sent by School of Music, Theatre 
and 
Dance 
senior 
Benjamin 
Jozwiak, IFC vice president of 
recruitment, to all attendees of 
the IFC Open Forum on Sept. 
16. The forum is an event where 
every IFC-affiliated fraternity 
has 
a 
table 
for 
interested 
students to learn more about 
their organization. In the email, 
Jozwiak encouraged students 
“regardless 
of 
eligibility” 
to attend the open houses. 
However, he instructed only 
eligible students to formally 
register for recruitment through 
the Recruitment and Intake 
Gateway.
Jozwiak did not respond to a 
request for comment. The Daily 
also reached out to all IFC-
affiliated fraternities on campus 
but did not receive any responses 
by the time of publication. 
In an interview with The Daily, 
Nicole Banks, assistant dean of 
students and interim director of 
Fraternity and Sorority Life, said 
the University sent materials 
in the mail and direct emails 
to all first-year students clearly 
outlining the new eligibility 
requirements. In addition, Banks 
said the FSL Office held public 
presentations with leaders of 
chapters and councils, alumni 
and advisers to discuss the new 
regulations.
Banks said enforcement of 
the 
policy 
centered 
around 
making sure it was well-known, 
especially 
among 
incoming 
students and their families. 
“And if someone really wants 
to suppress something that’s 
happening and especially if it’s 
happening off-campus, they’ll 
find a way, because we’re not 
spies,” Banks said. “We’re not 
out in spaces monitoring what 
students are doing at their off-
campus homes or facilities.” 
Banks explained students who 
are not eligible for recruitment 
are allowed to attend events 
open to the public in order to 
learn more about the various 
fraternities and sororities at 
the University. However, only 
eligible students are allowed to 
attend closed recruitment events, 
such as invite-only events, which 
are meant for potential new 
members and current members 
of the fraternity, she said.
“If a chapter is holding a 
closed event that is for their 
members and their potential new 
members, then people ought to 
meet the institutional eligibility 
criteria and their headquarter’s 
eligibility criteria,” Banks said. 
“I hope students operated in 
good faith, that if an event were 
open, there wasn’t anyone who 
was turned away for any reason.”
But all students interviewed 
for this article took part in at 
least some of the rush process, 
and The Daily has obtained 
text messages of IFC-affiliated 
fraternity 
brothers 
asking 
freshmen to come to various 
invite-only rush events. One 
student said he learned about 
rush through a post on the Class 
of 2023 Facebook group by the 
IFC-affiliated fraternity he is 
currently pledging, while others 
attended the IFC Open Forum. 
Banks said the FSL Office 
has heard rumors from students 
about violations of this policy. 
However, 
Banks 
said 
these 
rumors have been anonymous 
and 
have 
not 
named 
the 
organizations that participated, 
making 
it 
difficult 
for 
the 
University to take action.
“To have a cone of silence 
around 
an 
issue 
is 
really 
difficult,” 
Banks 
said. 
“The 
thought that these chapters, 
or some of these chapters, are 
violating a policy that could lead 
to harm, and not to have anything 
to narrow the scope of where to 
look, who to talk to, when to be 
concerned, what activities look 
like, what the extent of potential 
harm could be is really difficult.”
The 
Daily 
contacted 
the 
headquarters 
of 
every 
IFC-

affiliated fraternity on campus. 
Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Tau 
Omega, Beta Theta Pi, Delta 
Upsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Phi 
Kappa Psi, Psi Upsilon, Sigma 
Chi and Sigma Nu all responded, 
the majority writing they have 
no role in enforcing University 
policies that they believe infringe 
on students’ constitutional rights 
to free association.
The headquarters for Chi Phi, 
Delta Sigma Phi, Lambda Chi 
Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi 
Kappa Tau, Phi Kappa Alpha, 
Theta Delta Chi, Theta Xi and 
Triangle did not reply by time of 
publication. 
The Daily contacted multiple 
sources on-campus requesting 
an interview without anonymity 
to 
discuss 
their 
knowledge 
of 
IFC-affiliated 
fraternities 
recruiting freshmen students. 
All individuals either did not 
respond or declined to comment, 
citing fear of retaliation or social 
repercussions from the fraternity 
and sorority community.
Banks urged those who have 
knowledge of policy violations to 
report these situations to the FSL 
Office. She noted students can 
choose to report anonymously if 
they’d prefer. 
“If people are circumventing 
recruitment 
processes, 
tips, 
complaints, reports to our office 
help us to have constructive 
conversations and interventions 
where we need to,” Banks said. 
“If there’s compelling evidence 
an organization violated policies, 
a panel will review that and 
determine 
first 
whether 
or 
not there’s responsibility for 
violating policy, but also what’s 
the appropriate sanction.”
“Because of dirty rush, I’m 
not supposed to be rushing”
Student 2 is a freshman who 
received a bid from an IFC-
affiliated fraternity but decided 
not to continue with the pledging 
process. 
Student 
2 
believes 
freshmen made up the majority 
of 
students 
participating 
in 
recruitment events and every 
IFC-affiliated fraternity had fall 
recruitment of freshmen. The 
Daily could not independently 
confirm these statements.
“Literally 
every 
single 
affiliated frat did fall rush,” 
Student 2 said. “For the freshmen, 
I think it might be they count 
them as winter rushes, so they 
get registered when those do.” 
According to Banks, students 
planning to pursue membership 
in an IFC-affiliated fraternity 
are required to complete the 
Recruitment and Intake Gateway 
and register within the Campus 
Director 
database. 
Chapters 
are also supposed to provide 
the names of all students who 
received a bid.
Despite 
the 
University’s 
regulations, Student 3, a current 
freshman pledge in another 
IFC-affiliated fraternity, said 
he felt many people on campus 
knew IFC-affiliated fraternities 
were accepting freshmen as new 
members. Student 3 shared a 
screenshot of the pledge group 
chat he belongs to with The 
Daily.
“I don’t think there was a 
huge impact, like I don’t feel like 
‘Oh, don’t tell anyone’ or that I’m 
not allowed to talk about this or 
anything,” Student 3 said.
Additionally, 
Student 
1 
said he has not taken part in 
any of the training programs 
required by the University or 
his fraternity’s headquarters. 
Though 
necessary 
training 
varies 
between 
individual 
fraternities, the University and 
the IFC require all potential new 
fraternity members to complete 
workshops 
and 
courses 
on 
bystander 
behavior, 
hazing 
awareness and the University’s 
policies on sexual and gender-
based misconduct. 
“Because of dirty rush, I’m 
not supposed to be rushing, I 
have received zero training,” 
Student 1 said. “Sophomores are 
enrolled in that because they 
are not in this hidden process. 
They can do it because they are 
known by the University, but if I 
do it I screw over myself and the 
fraternity, so I can’t.”
“If you are a pledge, you 
should be doing the training 
that’s necessary”
One training program all 
new members of fraternities are 
required to complete is a 1.5-
hour University module on how 
to be a sober monitor. A sober 
monitor is a fraternity member 
who does not drink and works 
to keep parties and guests safe 
in situations involving alcohol 
and/or drugs. 

Student 3 said he has acted 
as a sober monitor at one party, 
serving alcohol at the bar. 
Student 3 confirmed he wore 
the neon orange shirt required by 
IFC policy to identify the party’s 
designated sober monitors. In 
lieu of official sober monitor 
training, Student 3 explained he 
received approximately five to 
10 minutes of verbal instruction 
from a brother and a written 
list describing all the roles. The 
Daily has obtained a copy of 
these written instructions. 
“I was sober monitoring, 
obviously I didn’t have the 
training for that, I was just kind 
of given an overview by one 
of the brothers that had been 
trained,” Student 3 said. “Within 
the people that were sobering, I 
would say it was roughly about 
25 percent pledges and 75 
percent of brothers who’d done 
the training. The head sober 
kind of like went through all 
those descriptions and asked if 
we understood what our job is, if 
we had any questions about it.”
Though Student 3 said he 
felt confident in his ability to 
carry out his roles, he said this 
is because he didn’t encounter a 
high-stress situation during his 
shift. 
“If you are a pledge, you 
should be doing the training 
that’s necessary,” Student 3 said. 
According to Banks, having 
freshmen students serve as 
sober monitors without training 
puts everyone who attends the 
event at risk. In addition, she 
said the situation is unfair to 
Ann Arbor residents who live 
near chapter houses and expect 
proper risk management. 
“I worry — I’m not saying this 
is the case, because I feel like 
we’re talking hypothetically — 
I worry about hazing,” Banks 
said. “What makes this person 
take on the responsibility of 
managing 
risk 
management 
at, I don’t know, a chapter 
facility of 6,000 square feet and 
hundreds of guests at a tailgate 
here in Michigan?... I think that 
the first-year student may not 
recognize the lack of power 
in that situation to actually 
confront problematic behavior 
and risk.”
“They didn’t bring up the 
policy”
Student 4, a freshman who 
decided not to continue with the 
recruitment process after rush, 
said members of the fraternities 
he interacted with encouraged 
freshmen students like himself 
to participate in recruitment.
“Brothers in the frats in 
Welcome Week told everyone, 
‘You should rush,’ that freshmen 
could rush,” Student 4 said. 
“They didn’t bring up the policy.”
Student 
5, 
a 
sophomore, 
took 
part 
in 
IFC-affiliated 
recruitment this year and his 
freshman 
year, 
before 
the 
deferred 
recruitment 
policy 
went into effect. He decided 
not to join an organization both 
years. Student 5 said the process 
this year seemed unaffected by 
the new University regulation.
“Since 
it 
wasn’t 
strictly 
enforced at all that freshmen 
weren’t allowed to rush, it was 
basically just like a sanctioned 
rush 
with 
freshmen 
and 
sophomores,” Student 5 said. 
“I didn’t notice any differences 
between 
when 
I 
rushed 
freshman year and sophomore 
year.”
According to Student 1, the 
nature of these recruitment 
events varied each time.
“After all the open houses, 
they’ll text you like a day later 
to come to the house at 10 
tomorrow,” Student 1 said. “And 
you go back and it completely 
depends. Sometimes it was a 
pretty chill event, where you 
were sober and just had a good 
time. There were some where 
the only point of that was to get 
drunk.”
All students interviewed said 
that to their knowledge, none 
of the Panhellenic sororities 
recruited 
freshmen 
this 
semester, and The Daily has not 
received any confirmation of 
Panhellenic sororities engaging 
in unsanctioned rush. However, 
one freshman student said one 
of the fraternity rush events 
he attended was hosted with a 
Panhellenic sorority. 
When asked for a statement, 
LSA 
senior 
Taylor 
Fegan, 
Panhellenic 
Association 
president, wrote to The Daily 
that sororities did not recruit 
freshmen students this semester. 
She noted the association works 
with 
various 
campus 
and 

The 
results 
of 
the 
assessment showed that while 
the schools are overall in fair 
condition, without substantial 
investment, many will fall 
into poor ratings within a few 
years. 
The assessment estimated 

it would cost $823 million 
to keep current buildings in 
good condition, not including 
other capital costs such as 
buses, technology, equipment 
and school additions, which is 
estimated to cost an additional 
$618 million. Together, the 
bond and the Sinking Fund, an 
Ann Arbor millage levied to 
aid in repair and construction 
of school buildings, provide 
enough funding to cover these 
costs. 
As Michigan is one of only 
about a dozen states that does 
not provide state funding for 
school infrastructure, many 
districts across the state also 
face the costs of improving 
aging infrastructure. AAPS 
points out in the bond proposal 
website 
that 
surrounding 
districts such as Saline, Dexter 
and Whitmore Lake have all 
started voter-backed facility 
upgrades in recent years. 
According to the website, 
Ann Arbor residents with a 
home taxable value of $138,000 
— the average in the school 
district — will see annual tax 
increases of $228. 
The Ann Arbor Education 
Association, 
the 
teacher’s 
union in Ann Arbor, remained 
neutral on the bond proposal. 
AAEA 
President 
Frederick 
Klein said the union is trying 
to send a message that teachers 
are feeling neglected in the 
district’s 
school 
budgeting 
process. He said teachers have 
been taking pay freezes and 
are not advancing up the year-
to-year salary steps, while 
watching their take-home pay 
shrink because of rising out-
of-pocket costs for health care.

“It was more of a statement 
of position that the teachers 
took to say, ‘Hey, we want to 
also be a priority,’” Klein said. 
“You prioritize infrastructure 
and all that, which is essential. 
But you also need to prioritize 
one of the most important 
cogs in the wheel, which is the 
teachers.”
Klein said the teachers were 
not consulted when AAPS 
was deciding how the bond 
would be spent until late in the 
process. 
“They did not come to the 
teachers until the middle of 
September to seek our input 
and support, which is really 
just superficial at that point, 
because the vote was a month 
and a half later,” Klein said. 
While the union did not 
openly support the bond, the 
group also did not speak out 
against it. 
“The union is not coming out 
and saying we’re anti-bond, 
we’re just remaining neutral,” 
Klein 
said. 
“Individual 
teachers, some will support it 
and some will not support it. 
It’s up to them to make those 
decisions when they reach the 
ballot box.”
The Ann Arbor Education 
Association is expected to 
begin bargaining with the 
district about financial issues 
on Dec. 11.

senior 
Bernadette King Fitzsimons 
attended 
Eberwhite 
Elementary School, Slauson 
Middle School and Pioneer 
High School. She shared some 
of the concerns voiced by 
Klein, but King Fitzsimons 
said while the schools were 
outdated, she did not feel 
they were a detriment to her 
education. 
“I do think the district needs 
to invest in infrastructure 
updates,” 
King 
Fitzsimons 
said. “But I think the district’s 
lack of investment in teacher 
salary over the years is deeply 
troubling, and needs to be 
addressed.”
Prior to the election, King 

Fitzsimons said she was not 
sure how she was going to 
vote. She said she was initially 
in support of the bond, but 
grew concerned that teacher 
salaries would not be raised 
along with the investment in 
infrastructure.
“In my time as a student in 
AAPS, the dedication of my 
educators impacted me far 
more than any state-of-the-art 
classroom could have,” King 
Fitzsimons said. 
Additionally, new with this 
election, voters were able to 
check the projected line wait 
times at polling places via 
the Ann Arbor City Clerk’s 
Office. The office is piloting an 
initiative to share the number 
of people in line and the 
estimated wait times reported 
by the election inspectors in 
real-time. 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Clerk 
Jacqueline Beaudry said in 
2018, poll workers submitted 
line information to the City 
Clerk’s Office so the office 
could deploy more resources 
where needed. They decided 
to 
share 
that 
information 
with the public in Tuesday’s 
election so that voters could 
decide when to vote. 
“As a result of that work 
in 2018, we thought that this 
information 
made 
public 
might also be useful to voters,” 
Beaudry said. “So we will still 
get that information as poll 
workers are entering it, for us 
to react, but then the public 
could also use it to make 
decisions about when is a good 
time to go vote or just check in 
on things.”
In the future, the office is 
planning on implementing the 
virtual line checker for the 
2020 primary and presidential 
elections. 
“If everything works as 
expected, and we see that it’s a 
positive benefit for the public 
to have access to this when 
there might be more chance 
for them to make a decision 
about when is a good time to 
get out (when they) don’t have

community resources to ensure 
the safety and wellness of their 
members and all University 
students. 
“The Panhellenic Association 
facilitated a partially structured 
fall recruitment this year to 
transition 
our 
community,” 
Fegan wrote. “Through this 
process, we welcomed more 
than 75 new members that 
met all institutional eligibility 
requirements 
and 
have 
continued 
to 
follow 
these 
regulations in all other council 
and chapter operations. The 
Panhellenic 
Association, 
specifically with regards to 
recruitment, operates entirely 
independently 
of 
other 
councils.”
When asked why he thinks 
sororities might decide not to 
conduct 
fall 
recruitment 
of 
freshmen, Student 1 explained 
he 
believes 
some 
male-
identifying students rely more 
heavily on the fraternity and 
sorority system. 
“Guys need Greek life, but 
I feel like for girls it’s more of 
an accessory,” Student 1 said. 
“Girls I feel like in general 
have stronger support systems, 
stronger friendships by default, 
and they can get into parties. 
Guys don’t have strong friends, 
guys don’t get into parties. It 
matters a lot less for girls.”
Similarly to Student 1, Student 
2 feels fraternities determine 
much of his social scene.
“Now, as a non-fraternity 
affiliated guy, my weekends are 
pretty desperate,” Student 2 
said. 
“It is an easy way to make 
connections”
To Student 3, being a part 
of a fraternity has been more 
beneficial than detrimental to 
his college transition. He said 
it’s helped him build both a 
social and professional network. 
“Being 
on 
campus, 
just 
overall, I see so many familiar 
faces around and whenever I 
want to be in a social setting or 
be around the brothers, I know 
I can just go to the house,” 
Student 3 said. “But also the 
connections to alumni of the 
fraternity, and overall there is 
a professional side of it, you are 
able to benefit from that wider 
network. Also, academically, it’s 
nice to have older brothers who 

are doing the same major as me, 
if I have questions.”
Student 3 said he hasn’t 
personally felt overwhelmed by 
his fraternity. However, he said 
he agrees with the University’s 
decision to defer rush, as he 
believes it can be a large time 
commitment 
and 
a 
high-
pressure environment to join 
other fraternities. 
“I haven’t felt like I couldn’t 
balance it, but I know other 
fraternities that probably have 
more hazing… So I think leaving 
it up to the student’s discretion 
is probably not the best thing to 
do, if you just look at the entire 
student population as a whole,” 
Student 3 said.
Though Student 3 mentioned 
hazing, The Daily has not 
confirmed 
that 
any 
hazing 
occurred during recruitment for 
any IFC-affiliated fraternity on 
campus this semester. 
Student 2 said he ultimately 
decided not to accept his bid 
because he thought pledging 
would make it more difficult 
to build friendships outside 
of the fraternity and keep up 
with academics as a freshman. 
Because of this, Student 2 said 
he understands the University’s 
regulations despite disagreeing 
with them. 
“I think (freshmen) should 
(join a fraternity) if they want 
to, but I do understand the 
merits of winter rush,” Student 
2 said. “I think it’s definitely a 
good idea to give time to settle 
into University life. Because if 
you’ve been here three weeks 
and you’re already thrown into 
this rat race, it’s very tolling. 
Just a lot on your mind, and a lot 
of time spent, and it could be to 
no avail.”
In 
contrast, 
Student 
1 
explained he has found his 
fraternity to be strong system of 
support in his college transition. 
“It is an easy way to make 
connections,” Student 1 said. 
“There are a lot of things when 
you first come in that end up 
being harder than you think 
they’re going to be, and I think 
making friends is one of those… 
Greek life is in many ways a 
mental health tool that many 
people don’t realize is a mental 
health tool.”
Similar to Student 1, Student 
5 said he believes freshmen 

should be allowed to participate 
in fraternity and sorority life 
during their first semester on 
campus.
“As a freshman in college, 
you are old enough to choose for 
yourself what you want to do,” 
Student 5 said. 
Student 6 is a freshman who 
attended several rush events 
before deciding not to continue 
with the process to join other 
organizations instead. Though 
Student 6 said he found the 
recruitment process to be time-
consuming, he thinks it should 
be up to the student to decide if 
they want to join a fraternity.
“It’s 
not 
necessarily 
unreasonable for students to do, 
if you manage your course load 
well,” Student 6 said. “Obviously 
it’s a lot of time but I think it’s 
still very manageable rushing 
a fraternity at the same time. I 
know some people drop their 
fraternities, if they decide upon 
other things they wanted to 
pursue… So I mean that’s always 
a thing people can do.” 
“A culture of dirty rushing”
Student 1 said he believes the 
University’s regulations and the 
resulting unsanctioned rush has 
a negative impact overall. 
“I think it’s probably a bad 
thing, just because everything is 
under the radar,” Student 1 said. 
“The University tried to clamp 
down on that, they went too far, 
and now they have overall less 
control because of it.”
Student 3 also said he thinks 
there are going to be people 
who break the rules regardless. 
As a result, the University’s 
regulations 
ultimately 
result 
in “a culture of dirty rushing,” 
where rush is less regulated and 
pledges do not get the training 
they need, Student 3 explained.
However, Student 2 said he 
thinks less regulation does not 
necessarily mean a harsher 
pledging process. 
“I guess they could if they 
wanted to do more weird shit, 
because 
it’s 
not 
regulated,” 
Student 2 said. “But there’s 
an incentive for frats not to 
destroy their pledges. The topic 
is so sensitive today anyway, if 
anything were to come out the 
entire system would be shut 
down. There’s not much faith 
in Greek life from the public’s 
perspective anymore.”

Securing reproductive justice

H

ypocrisy 
pervades 
the 
United 
States 
regarding 
women’s 
reproductive 
rights, with many 
politicians positing 
their indifference 
toward 
fundamental rights 
as an effort against 
unnecessary 
government 
interference 
in 
the 
private 
industry. 
An 
unsettling number 
of 
fervent 
Republicans 
oppose 
universal 
health 
care 
coverage 
of 
birth 
control 
— 
a 
puzzling 
position 
considering 
our 
country’s 
self-proclaimed 
status as a leader in human 
rights 
advocacy. 
Though 
Americans tend to have an 
inflated ego regarding our 
standing 
in 
reproductive 
rights 
in 
comparison 
to 
other countries, the reality 
is that we are not quite up to 
par. In fact, the U.S. has the 
worst 
maternal 
mortality 
rate in the developed world. 
If America wants to improve 
reproductive 
justice, 
we 
must work to ensure all 
forms of birth control are 
covered by American health 
insurance providers. 
Among 
many 
of 
the 
hardships I had imagined I 
would face transitioning to 
college life and “adulting,” 
access to birth control was 
never 
one 
I 
particularly 
pondered. After 
a 
quick, 
informal 
visit 
to 
my 
OB-GYN right before the 
end of high school, I was 
prescribed a generic brand 
of birth control pills to be 
taken daily. Once I arrived 
at college, I quickly became 
aware that my birth control 
pills caused a multitude 
of rather unpleasant side 
effects. 
Immediately, 
I 
called the University Health 
Service 
to 
explore 
other 
possible options of birth 
control. I soon discovered, to 
my dismay, that the cheapest 
insurance my self-employed 
parents could find was under 
a religious exemption and 

did not cover birth control. 
To this day, I begrudgingly 
continue to take oral birth 
control pills simply 
due to convenience 
and its low out-of-
pocket 
cost, 
not 
because they are 
the optimal for my 
situation. 
The failures of 
our 
health 
care 
system 
construct 
a 
harsh 
reality 
for many women 
in 
situations 
both similar and different 
to mine. While I have 
privilege in that I can afford 
the relatively low out-of-
pocket cost for oral birth 
control pills, many women 
in 
remote 
communities 
experience 
difficulty 
finding 
transportation 
to access birth control or 
money to pay for any type 

of contraceptive altogether. 
Not 
only 
are 
women 
in 
poverty 
exceptionally 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
an 
unintentional 
pregnancy, 
but chances of additional 
consequences, such as lack 
of proper prenatal care, are 
also higher. It’s only logical 
that our government take 
preemptive measures against 
unwanted pregnancies if it 
seeks to reduce the number 
of abortions. Providing more 
birth control coverage is one 
effective method of doing so. 
As long as the government 
continues 
to 
neglect 
its 
responsibilities in ensuring 
contraceptive coverage for 
all, inequality will continue. 
This exclusion of the low-
income individuals violates 
the promises of not only the 

fulfillment of reproductive 
rights, 
but 
reproductive 
justice as well. Those in 
poverty 
will 
continue 
to suffer because of the 
government’s 
inability 
to 
provide 
the 
basic 
right 
of 
choosing 
whether 
or 
not to have children — a 
foundational 
tenant 
of 
reproductive justice.
There 
does 
exist 
an 
economic 
incentive 
for 
the 
federal 
government 
to 
provide 
universal 
contraceptive 
coverage 
beyond 
simply 
protecting 
reproductive 
rights. 
The 
more access women have 
to contraception, the less 
unintended 
pregnancies 
will occur, meaning more 
women will be able to keep 
and work jobs, pursue an 
education and contribute to 
the growing economy. Giving 
women 
control 
of 
when 
they 
reproduce 
translates 
to a greater, stronger, less 
variable workforce. America 
consistently acts in favor 
of business and economic 
interests, 
but 
perhaps 
some have not considered 
the 
various 
benefits 
to 
business 
the 
advancement 
of 
reproductive 
justice 
provides. 
The benefits of providing 
universal 
contraceptive 
coverage under all health 
insurance providers greatly 
outweigh 
any 
possible 
consequences. 
Universal 
coverage would make birth 
control even more accessible 
to the disadvantaged, helping 
tear down the wall between 
the poor and the wealthy. 
Additionally, 
extended 
coverage of birth control 
would benefit economic and 
business interests by creating 
a 
larger, 
more 
cohesive 
workforce. If the U.S. wishes 
to be taken more seriously 
internationally 
in 
regard 
to human rights advocacy, 
and improve our quality of 
reproductive justice, drastic 
measures must be taken in 
the near future.

I

f you have been following 
politicians or economists 
over the past few years, 
you’ve 
probably 
heard 
about 
the 
idea of a carbon 
tax thrown around 
as 
an 
important 
tool 
for 
fighting 
climate 
change 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Despite 
discussion 
 
year 
after year, nothing 
ever happens with 
it. 
Implementing 
a carbon tax is the first and 
easiest step we can take 
towards 
slowing 
climate 
change. 
Taxes aren’t fun. Indeed, 
no one likes paying them, 
but they are an effective and 
important economic tool for 
correcting market failures. 
A 
market 
failure 
occurs 
anytime the market naturally 
produces 
an 
inefficient 
outcome 
through 
either 
incomplete 
information 
or an imbalance in market 
power. In relation to climate 
change, the burning of fossil 
fuels 
and 
the 
subsequent 
greenhouse 
gasses 
that 
are generated is a negative 
externality in the market — 
my choice to burn one more 
ton of fuel impacts other 
people, at a negative cost, 
without taking that cost into 
the price of the transaction. 
Taxes work to remedy this. 
They raise the costs of the 
private transaction in order 
to reduce the total number of 
transactions. 
But is a carbon tax worth 
it? Some critics say that 
carbon 
pricing 
would 
be 
largely ineffective in actually 
stopping 
climate 
change. 
It’s true that a carbon tax 
alone will not be able to stop 
anything by itself — but it can 
delay its effects. Additionally, 
it shouldn’t be the only policy 
enacted, but rather the first 
step towards a reasonable and 

effective portfolio of climate-
forward policies. As far as 
climate policies go, a carbon 
tax is the lowest 
hanging fruit.
Another concern 
is 
that 
carbon 
pricing 
could 
be 
a 
regressive 
tax. 
Structurally, 
the 
policy 
would 
levy 
a 
per-unit 
tax on fossil fuel 
on 
the 
producer 
(for 
exmaple, 
companies 
would 
have to pay per barrel of 
oil they extract from the 
ground). However, producers 
will pass along some of the 
cost of the tax to consumers 
by 
raising 
prices. 
In 
a 

perfectly responsive market, 
people would then consume 
less as a result of the price 
change. The problem is that 
fossil 
fuels 
today 
remain 
an inelastic good: People 
can’t 
easily 
reduce 
their 
consumption overnight. 
How 
you 
view 
the 
legitimacy of that argument 
largely 
depends 
on 
your 
reasoning 
behind 
who 
is 
buying what and how much 
of it. On the one hand, lower 
income 
communities 
have 
less free cash to switch 
to 
more 
environmentally 
friendly alternatives. They 
can’t just trade in their gas-
guzzler for a Tesla to avoid 
the 
higher 
price 
of 
gas. 
Alternatively, richer people 
burn more on the aggregate 

just by way of owning more 
things (multiple cars instead 
of one), or through more 
air travel. As it turns out, 
this intuition is more likely 
to be the case. In the U.S., 
wealthier 
people 
produce 
more emissions, even those 
who describe themselves as 
“green” or “environmentally 
conscious.”
One of the more exciting 
perspectives about carbon 
taxes is the ability to draw 
bipartisan support. A popular 
national 
policy 
proposal 
currently in circulation is 
a carbon fee and dividend. 
This policy, with Republican 
and Democratic support in 
Congress, 
would 
address 
many of the related issues. 
What is unique about the 
fee and dividend proposal 
is that it is revenue-neutral. 
All the revenue generated 
by the tax is redistributed 
to all Americans. This is to 
help offset any rising prices 
as a result of the tax and is a 
progressive solution to what 
others argue is a regressive 
tax.
Yet, as I stated earlier, we 
have been here before. The 
economic and environmental 
justifications for a carbon tax 
in any form are established 
and 
clearly 
defined. 
We 
simply 
lack 
the 
political 
will, it seems, to actually 
do anything about it. The 
current 
administration, 
at 
the national level, does not 
prioritize 
adopting 
smart 
climate policies at all — in 
fact, it’s almost the opposite. 
That 
needs 
to 
change. 
Especially if something bold 
like the Green New Deal 
never comes to be. In the 
absence of scoring a “Hail 
Mary” touchdown, we need 
to kick the easy field goal in 
passing a carbon tax to help 
slow climate change.

We must support impeachment
N

early a month after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced an 
official impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, the House 
of Representatives voted Thursday to endorse a resolution outlining 
the parameters for the impeachment process. In light of these disturbing 
allegations, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board commends Speaker Pelosi and 
the Democratic leadership for moving forward with an impeachment inquiry.

While it is unclear how the 
impeachment 
proceedings 
will 
unfold, 
and 
how 
an 
impeachment 
might 
affect the outcome of the 
2020 election, it is vitally 
important 
that 
Congress 
continues to hold President 
Trump accountable for his 
actions — especially those 
which 
endanger 
national 
security and violate his oath 
of office.
For many, Pelosi’s Sept. 24 
announcement of an official 
impeachment 
inquiry 
seemed long overdue. During 
his 
tenure, 
Trump 
has 
committed several acts that 
may qualify as impeachable 
offenses. 
In 
his 
March 
report, 
Special 
Counsel 
Robert 
Mueller 
identified 
several 
instances 
of 
obstruction of justice during 
the burgeoning investigation 
into his ties to Russian 
foreign interference. 
The 
news 
that 
Trump 
pressured 
Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky 
to 
investigate 
Former Vice President Joe 
Biden and his son represents 
the latest in a series of offenses 
that have endangered national 
security. For many who were 
unconvinced by the results 
of 
Mueller’s 
investigation, 
Trump’s 
badgering 
of 
a 
foreign leader to investigate a 
domestic political opponent is 
a more convincing argument 
for impeachment, especially 
when there seems to have 
been an implied quid pro 
quo for Ukraine to receive 
Congressionally-appropriated 
aid. 
In 
early 
September, 
a 
whistleblower echoed these 
allegations in a complaint 
which 
Michael 
Atkinson, 
the Intelligence Community 
Inspector General, claimed 
includes “serious or flagrant 
problem, abuse or violation 
of the law.” In a Sept. 17 
letter, 
Atkinson 
expressed 
frustration that the Justice 
Department and the Director 
of 
National 
Intelligence 
withheld the complaint from 
Congress. The declassified 
complaint was made public on 
Sept. 26. Since then, six other 

officials have testified that 
a trade-off existed between 
Zelensky and Trump. 
Since 
its 
release, 
few 
Republicans have commented 
on 
the 
whistleblower 
complaint. 
Even 
with 
claims that 30 Republican 
senators would be willing to 
impeach Trump in a “secret 
vote,” 
Republicans 
who 
openly speak out against 
Trump face severe political 
repercussions. 
With 
23 
Republican senators up for 
reelection in 2020, few have 
openly entertained the idea 
of 
impeachment, 
though 
cracks 
are 
starting 
to 
show in Senate Republican 
support for the president. 
With the 2020 election 
on the horizon, it would 
be a mistake to treat this 
impeachment inquiry as an 
issue central to the election 
cycle. While the effects of 
the impeachment process 
will 
certainly 
have 
far-
reaching 
ramifications, 
members of Congress and 
the public should remember 
that 
the 
impeachment 
process is a constitutional 
obligation, not a ploy to 
leverage political power. 
Elected 
representatives 
are bound by their oaths of 
office to protect and defend 
the Constitution. The 232 
members of Congress who 
voted in favor of the House 
Democrats’ 
resolution 
demonstrated 
a 
strong 
commitment to upholding 
both the law and democratic 
principles, 
though 
that 
commitment does not exist 
on both sides of the aisle. 
Following the House’s vote 
on Thursday, it is more 
important than ever that 
the Democratic leadership 
moves forward dutifully and 
strategically in laying out 
the case for impeachment. 
The quality of messaging 
is crucial as the House aims 
to 
sway 
public 
opinion. 
Democrats ought to make 
clear that this impeachment 
process is not about revenge 
for the 2016 election, nor 
is it a behind-closed-doors 
violation 
of 
due 
process 
against 
an 
unpopular 

president. 
Instead, 
they 
need to emphasize Trump’s 
actions 
demonstrably 
violated his oath of office 
and 
endangered 
national 
security. This impeachment 
process is not politicking-
as-usual, but a necessary 
defense of the Constitution 
and our republic. 
While the process may 
hinder some sitting senators’ 
campaign 
schedules, 
the 
responsibility of our elected 
officials to uphold justice 
should 
take 
precedence 
despite 
the 
impeachment 
inquiry occurring in tandem 
with the 2020 election. While 
trust 
in 
the 
government 
varies between parties, this 
public faith is currently at 
a historic low. Democrats 
have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
help restore public faith in 
government officials. 
The House’s vote to move 
forward with impeachment 
proceedings began a new 
chapter 
in 
the 
Trump 
presidency. As more and 
more public officials — such 
as the Republican governor 
of Vermont — begin to openly 
favor moving forward with 
the impeachment process, 
it 
becomes 
increasingly 
apparent 
that 
this 
administration’s days may be 
numbered. 
The political consequences 
are 
surely 
uncertain. 
A 
mishandled 
impeachment 
battle could set Democrats 
up for trouble in the coming 
election 
year. 
However, 
the 
potential 
political 
turmoil should not distract 
Democrats and the rest of 
Congress 
from 
fulfilling 
their constitutional duty to 
protect 
national 
security. 
They need to follow Pelosi’s 
lead — she set a precedent on 
Sept. 24 of valuing her own 
obligation to the Constitution 
over 
political 
infighting 
and outside conflict. As the 
House moves forward with 
the 
impeachment 
process 
in a more robust and public 
manner, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board encourages 
members of Congress, public 
officials and the American 
public to follow suit.

The U.S. has the

world

Seeing as it’s 2019, it’s really about time that 
a movie about Harriet Tubman was made. Most 
people only know Harriet Tubman for her role 
as a conductor of the Underground Railroad, but 
as “Harriet,” directed by Kasi Lemmons (“Black 
Nativity”), shows, she had a much greater 
story than that. Tubman did more than just 
lead slaves to free land; she led soldiers in the 
Civil War, she was an aggressive and powerful 
woman who didn’t let men tell her what she 
could and couldn’t do and above all, she had the 
utmost care and devotion for her family. Her 
story deserved to be played in theaters around 
the world. 
However, “Harriet” may not have been the 
best way to showcase it.
There seems to be a disconnect in the 
storytelling of the script and the action on 
screen. Any time Harriet is being chased by 
slave-catchers, we as an audience are supposed 
to feel suspense. We are supposed to hold our 
breath as we wait for her to reach safety. But 
when her running seems like a slow jog and 
the chase scenes are dragged out to the point 
of being unrealistic, the stakes feel lowered. 
It doesn’t feel like she is really being chased. 
It doesn’t feel like she is running for her life. 
These action scenes feel overly scripted and 
too careful to be believable, which is a major 
disappointment. 
The subpar action scenes and forced dialogue 
are, unfortunately, not the worst parts of the 
movie. The most devastating thing about the 
film is that there are parts of Harriet Tubman’s 
life that are fictionalized, over-exaggerated 
and entirely falsified for dramatic purpose. 
A central plot point of the film was Gideon 
Brodess’s (Joe Alwyn, “The Favourite”) pursuit 
of Harriet after her escape. Alwyn did a great 
job of portraying an obviously evil character 
with malicious intent, which makes the 
falsified part of his character so much worse. 
In the film, he is the son of her owner Edward 
Brodess, but in Harriet Tubman’s real life, 
Gideon Brodess did not exist. The character was 
added to the story for dramatic effect, which is 
disappointing, because Tubman’s inspiring life 
story should be enough in itself to be the plot of 
a film. Adding dramatizations seems to belittle 
what she actually did.
Similarly, the film portrays Harriet as having 
“spells” (following a childhood head injury) 
where she believes she can contact God and see 
the future. While in real life, Harriet Tubman 
did believe that she had a connection to God via 
these spells, the movie over-exaggerated her 
condition and made it seem like the only reason 
she had any success in freeing herself and other 

slaves was because of a semi-supernatural 
ability. Just as with the addition of Gideon 
Brodess, this undermines what she actually 
accomplished. In real life, she couldn’t actually 
see the future; she escaped and helped others 
escape because of her resourcefulness, stealth 
and courage. In the movie, it seemed as though 
she only relied on a “super” ability to see into 
the future and contact God to be a successful 
Underground Railroad conductor.
The heartfelt acting was probably the film’s 
only redeeming quality. Cynthia Erivo (“Bad 
Times at El Royale”) did an excellent job in 
bringing an amazing woman to life on screen. 
Harriet’s love for her family and her unshakable 
faith in God were portrayed so believably on 
screen that as I watched Erivo act, it seemed 
like I was right there with Harriet Tubman, 
watching 
her 
accomplish 
such 
amazing 
achievements in life. 
“Harriet” enlightened me, and I’m sure 
many other viewers, about aspects of Harriet 
Tubman’s life that until now had gone mostly 
forgotten, but frankly, the fictionalized aspects 
of her story are unforgivable. Adding extra 
drama through a fake character and adding 
an almost supernatural quality to a real life 
human being makes Harriet Tubman’s story 
seem unrealistic. These additions to the story 
are disappointing, unnecessary and make for a 
rather disheartening viewing experience.

‘Harriet’ was good, but bad

BOOK REVIEW

In her debut novel, “Last Ones Left Alive,” 
Sarah Davis-Goff boldly takes on a genre that 
can go wrong in so many ways: the zombie-
thriller novel. The main monster has to be 
scary while also being believable, there have 
to be defined rules to the world without over-
explanation, the characters have to undergo 
some sort of growth without being swallowed 
by the drama of the zombie (no pun intended). 
Davis-Goff manages to sidestep these pitfalls 
and creates a feminist, environmentally-
concious, survivalist coming-of-age story. It 
follows 15-year-old Orpen as she embarks on a 
journey to leave her island, the only place she 
has ever known, after the death of her mother 
(“Mam”) and her mother’s partner, Maeve. She 
lives in a post-apocalyptic Ireland, decimated 
by a mysterious event called “the Emergency” 
that turns those who are bit into “skrakes,” 
the zombie-like principal monsters of the 
book. Maeve and Mam are the only people 
Orpen has ever met before leaving the island, 
and Maeve has just one rule regarding others: 
“Beware people.” Maeve and Mam train Orpen 
rigorously in the hope that she will one day be 
able to leave the island with them, but a skrake 
bites her mother and two years later, another 
bites Maeve. This propels Orpen to finally 
venture off the island in search of a rumored 
all-female fighting force called the “banshees” 
and their home, Phoenix City.
Without ever describing the cataclysmic 
event that led to the destruction of society as 
we know it, the novel still does an excellent 
job building a believable post-apocalyptic 
world in which the vestiges of civilized 
society, like skyscrapers and signposts, have 
all half-disintegrated and left room for nature 
to come back in full force. Davis-Goff spends 
precisely enough time describing Orpen’s 
lush surroundings; her writing is beautiful 
and descriptive without feeling unnecessary 
or 
drawn-out. 
The 
environment 
always 
seems to subtly reflect Orpen’s inner state — 
after a brush with death, she describes the 
landscape by saying, “the green of the grass 
is particularly violent-looking against the 
darkening clouds.” There is harmony and 
dissonance in the way people interact with 
their environment in this novel, a distinction 
made between taking from the land and living 
with it. Orpen repeatedly expresses her awe 
and confusion at the technological marvels 
of the world she never knew, wondering, for 
example, why gas was pumped to the island 
to power the heating when it would be much 
easier to just build a fire outside. Orpen has a 
certain environmental innocence, and Davis-
Goff uses this to make a subtle point about our 
sometimes over-complicated technological 
problem-solving. 
The only living connections to this past are 
Orpen’s mother and Maeve, and they are also 
Orpen’s only example of romantic love. The 
deftness of Davis-Goff’s portrayal of a same-
sex couple comes from her ability to not over-
explain. She never feels the need to hit the 
reader over the head with the fact that the main 
romantic relationship portrayed in the novel 
is a lesbian one. Instead, she allows this fact 
to be unquestioned and almost uninteresting 
— in a world infested with zombies, there’s 
no time to ponder the existence of a same-sex 

couple. Orpen has never known anything else, 
she never questions it, and because it does 
not concern Orpen, it does not concern us as 
readers. Davis-Goff makes it clear that there 
is real love between Mam and Maeve, and that 
this love existed before Orpen was even alive. 
The other and decidedly less well-developed 
romantic coupling in the book is between 
Orpen and Cillian, a man she meets on the road 
to Phoenix City. Before she meets Cillian, she 
has never met a man before, and in fact Mam 
and Maeve posit men as a threat equal to the 
skrake in the real world. Orpen is consistently 
told that the world before “the Emergency” was 
characterized by “men making the decisions 
and women suffering from them” — her main 
takeaway from Mam and Maeve’s teachings is 
that “men are dangerous.” Consequently, she 
is terrified and aggressive upon her initial 
meeting with Cillian. But over the remainder 
of the book, she ends up developing feelings 
for him. This romance, in contrast to Mam 
and Maeve’s gentle and sure companionship, 
feels gratuitous. Orpen spends her whole 
life conditioned to believe that men are the 
source of all evil, and when she finally meets a 
man, the only way that she can overcome this 
ingrained assumption is to fall in love. For its 
first half, the novel seems to finally build a 
dystopian plot with a young female protagonist 
who manages not to have a romantic side-plot. 
With this hope in mind, Orpen’s romance 
with Cillian is a disappointment. With so few 
characters, Cillian is the only male character 
in the book, and the lesson Orpen learns from 
him is essentially that, “men aren’t that awful 
after all.” This message is not problematic in 
itself, but the fact that Orpen can only seem 
to reach it by falling in love is. Their romance 
cheapens the stronger bonds presented in the 
novel, and undercuts Davis-Goff’s point that 
within the patriarchy there are still decent 
men. 
Despite the pothole of Orpen and Cillian’s 
relationship, this novel’s road to being a well-
crafted feminist novel is relatively clear. 
Davis-Goff has a basic feminist principle 
anchoring the book: Two strong women raise 
Orpen, another strong woman, who survives 
using her own skills and wits. Amid the many 
themes with which this novel grapples, at its 
core it is a coming-of-age novel about a young 
girl who must venture out into an unforgiving 
world alone. Strip away the zombies and the 
crumbling civilization and Orpen is simply a 
girl teetering at the point between child and 
adult being thrust into maturity in a world she 
does not yet understand.

‘Last Ones Left Alive’ pairs
zombies and feminism well

EMILIA FERRANTE
For The Daily

Stop what you are doing right now and listen to “A Postcard to 
Nina” by Jens Lekman. 
Jens Lekman is a Swedish indie musician from Gothenburg. 
He sings mostly of love and daily life in Nordic towns. His best 
work is the 2007 album Night Falls Over Kortedala, a rich fusion of 
baroque, orchestral pop and sample-based, blue-eyed soul, full of 
lush swells and silvery horns. I have written about music for three 
years and have been an insatiable consumer of music for much 
longer. In all those years, no album has made me feel as purely 
happy as when I listen to Night Falls Over Kortedala. 
It is difficult to pin down what makes Jens Lekman’s voice so 
evocative. His tone is pellucid and sweet. He has a showbizzy 
style similar to singers such as Billy Joel or Michael Bublé, but 
his ineffable sincerity sets him apart. Where others come across 
as smarmy and inauthentic, Lekman feels earnest. He is effective 
at convincing the listener that his stylized vocal timbre is not a 
mere affectation, but an expression of his rich internal experience. 
Musically, his ability to combine disco rhythms with chamber pop 
or crashing drums with candied harps, creating a distinctive yet 
familiar sound without coming off as either tongue-in-cheek or 
saccharine, is nothing short of miraculous. 
I have a love for this world / A kind of love that will break my heart
Most twee music is obnoxious in that it ignores the darkness and 
pain that we all experience. It feels almost insulting, as though the 
performer is trying to trick you and/or themselves. In contrast, 
Lekman lives in a world where sadness and pain are real and 
powerful. However, the world of Jens Lekman is beautiful anyway. 
It is precisely not for his lack of pain but for the strength of his 
response to it that the musician is such an inspiring narrator. “The 
Opposite of Hallelujah” is a sweet and wholesome song not because 
it is optimistic — in fact, the lyrics concern the inescapable distance 
between our inner lives, and are mostly quite depressing — but for 
its relentless authenticity and heart in the face of suffering. Most 
artists who attempt to make similar music also tend to be pathetic 
to the point of revulsion — not Lekman. While emotional and kind, 

he never expects or desires pity. He also has what might strike us 
a characteristically European sense of humor, goofy and innocent, 
that prevents his lyrics from slipping into whininess. 
I was slicing up an avocado
The beauty Jens conveys tends to revolve around everyday 
occasions — biking with his sister to the shore, an awkward 
interaction with a friend’s father — and their unexpected 
intersections with meaning. When he finds such gravity in 
mundanity, it makes me hopeful that I can, like him, discover a 
deeper significance to the seemingly trivial. 
I think I’m gonna drop my cool 
now / The best way to touch your 
heart is to make an ass of myself
This line coming from another 
artist 
would 
be 
awkward. 
Indeed, there are times when 
Jens is too cheesy, such as in 
the above quote. These lapses in 
Jens’s delicate balance between 
sincerity and oversentimentality, 
while not all that enjoyable, 
at least serve to make his 
authenticity clear. Jens is not 
afraid to overextend and make 
a fool of himself in the course 
of baring his soul. I think his 
sense of amiable guilelessness 
combined with a healthy dose of 
self-deprecation) helps to make 
even his embarrassing moments 
endearing.
She says that we were just 
make-believe / But I thought she 
said ‘maple leaves’
This line is from the best 
song Jens has made that is not 
on Night Falls Over Kortedala: 
“Maple Leaves.” It doesn’t sound 
that much like Night Falls Over 

Kortedala — it’s more of an Avalanches-inspired sample collage 
than baroque pop. The narrative plot of the song revolves around 
a simple misunderstanding during a complex conversation with 
a lover. In some ways, it is the purest encapsulation of his voice: 
Heartfelt and lovelorn, he sees beauty (“maple leaves”) where 
there exists dissatisfaction (“make-believe”) in the eyes of his 
lover. The delicate balance he strikes between melancholy world-
weariness and hopeless romanticism creates a world where every 
detail is imbued with color and meaning. Jens makes you want to 
see life through his eyes.

DIY COLUMN

I really didn’t become very involved in my 
local music scene until I came to Ann Arbor. 
I’m not sure if my hometown just didn’t have 
much going on, or if I just wasn’t looking 
hard enough, but when I stumbled into my 
first basement show, I was amazed at how 
different of an experience it was for me. Even 
crazier, I saw one of the guitarists from that 
show on a Bursley-Baits bus the next day. 
For a second, I was sort of taken aback 
— why were they on the same bus as me? 
I didn’t see this person as a human on the 
same plane of existence as me. I seemed to 
forget that they were also students, probably 
stressed out by classes, running on not 
enough sleep and apparently taking Bursley-
Baits everyday, just like everyone else. I saw 
their existence as beginning and ending on 
stage. 
I think this is one of the things that’s really 
special about having a local music scene and 
being involved in it. At bigger concerts — 
ones not held in basements — there’s a huge 
disconnect between the musicians and the 
audience. You’ll see them come on stage, play 
their set and then walk off. After that, unless 
you stand out behind the venue circling their 
tour bus like a vulture, you probably won’t 
see them again until the next time you go 
to one of their shows. With DIY and local 
music in general, besides the fact that there’s 
typically no green room in a basement for 
artists to hide in, you’ll see these musicians 
everywhere you go. The artists on stage are 
the same people you’ll see in your classes, at 
parties and even on the bus.
For me, this has only made the music more 
special. Seeing people that are just like you, 
or that you may even have a relationship 
with, get on stage and pour themselves into 
a performance is an incredible experience 
that has absolutely changed the way I think 
about music. My freshman year, a band from 
Ann Arbor called Bonzo put out an album 
titled Stranger during my first fall break. 
I had seen the group perform once, and 
knew some of the members through random 
interactions with mutual friends at parties 
and shows. So, after seeing the album shared 
around Facebook, and even stumbling into 
their album release show, I decided to follow 
the Bandcamp link that would help change 
the way I view music making.
It wasn’t simply the fact that it was a good 
album that was right up my alley. It was 
the fact that it was all that and it was made 
by people that I knew. People that I had 

talked to and had experiences with prior to 
listening to their music. The huge shoegazy 
soundscapes felt even larger and even 
more impenetrable than they already were 
because I knew the people making them. 
It was cathartic for me, and being made by 
people that were in the same environment 
I was in, who were having similar, albeit 
nowhere near identical, experiences. With 
bigger name artists, there’s almost a whole 
mythology behind the music. That person 
could be at a completely different point in 
their life than I am, or could be a completely 
different person than I imagine them to be, 
making it difficult for me to relate or insert 
myself into their music. But with Stranger, 
this wasn’t the case.
Since then, I’ve encountered this same 
feeling on many separate occasions (and it’s 
pretty difficult not to when you live with 
five other incredibly creative and talented 
individuals). And maybe this stems a little bit 
from me being a bit of an emotional person, 
but I honestly think knowing the individuals 
behind the music is a quality about local 
music that truly makes it special. It not only 
humanizes it, but it also furthers the feeling 
of intimacy that DIY is known for.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

1980s rock music blared through unseen 
speakers upon entering the apartment of 
Dennis Ziegler, as he slammed his door and 
stumbled into his magazine and solo cup 
strewn bed. Of course, it wasn’t an actual 
apartment, but the black-box-esque Newman 
Studio encouraged the audience to participate 
in the action of the play, feeling like we were 
sitting on the couch watching Dennis dance 
around his apartment to scratchy records, 
maybe even sharing his blunt.
Basement Arts’s production of “This Is 
Our Youth,” written by Kenneth Lonergan 
and directed by School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance junior Skylar Siben, detailed the lives 
of three teenagers in the ’80s exploring love, 
drugs, family relationships and the terrifying 
inescapable reality of adulthood in the best 
possible way.
The three-person play portrayed the 
complicated relationships among teenagers 
engaging in new experiences and exploring 
the world outside of high school and their 
parents’ control. SMTD senior Ted Gibson’s 
character was the life of the party. His 
enigmatic performance brought humor and 
vivacity to an otherwise dark show. SMTD 
sophomore Claire Vogel and SMTD senior 

Bryan Chan’s characters made an adorably 
innocent couple, until their ultimate demise. 
All three of them were entangled in each 
other’s stories in different capacities. 
With the audience surrounding the set on 
all sides, the intimate stage setup made the 
audience an active part of the show. While this 
aspect of the play definitely made this “slice-
of-life” show feel authentic and genuine, 
the only downside was that it unfortunately 
blocked out parts of the performance to 
certain sections of the audience. With such 
an intimate, actor-driven show, seeing their 
reactions to each other was essential in 
understanding the plot and connecting with 
the performance.
Despite this, the staging was incredibly 
smart, with every detail thought through. 
The 
temperature 
gage 
doubled 
as 
the 
apartment intercom, the backstage door was 
used as the apartment entrance, the lighting 
beautifully signified drug usage by trading 
simple spotlights for an array of colors. 
Despite having very little scenery, the show 
felt utterly real. Not one eye was batted at a 
stool used as a fridge or a curtain signifying 
the bathroom because the actors worked hard 
to make their actions revolving around those 
objects lifelike. This black-box environment 
was the perfect setting for such a personal 
show.
The show itself is a fascinating one, 
delving into important topics that capture 
the experience of youth. Though the specific 
experiences each character goes through are 
not necessarily universal, their thoughts, 
feelings and reactions to their situations are. 
The connections each of the three characters 
form with one another are compelling and 
relatable, written in some of the most natural 
and realistic language I’ve ever witnessed. 
Unfortunately, some of the specific language 
was a little too realistic to the ’80s culture. 
Written in 1999 and taking place in 1982, 
certain parts definitely didn’t age well — 
namely the use of racist slurs and offensive 
language. 
However, the majority of the sentiments 
still ring true today. This show beautifully 
portrays the trials and triumphs of being 
young. Though some of the characters’ 
lifestyle choices are unique, the attitudes and 
musings are relatable to everyone — whether 
they are remembering their youth or still 
living it.

‘Youth’ is sweetly relevant

DANA PIERANGELI

There’s a moment in “See” that is meant to 
be terrifying. Being chased by a ravenous and 
violent army, the Alkenny villagers are running 
for their lives. Paris (Alfre Woodard, “The Lion 
King”), the village midwife, comes upon a bridge 
that crosses a dangerous ravine. She’s not even 
sure it’s there. She can’t see it — she’s blind, as is 
everyone else in Apple’s post-apocalyptic series.
After a virus wiped out much of humanity, the 
remaining 2,000,000 humans emerged from the 
carnage blind. After centuries, they’ve adapted 
to blindness, so much so that the idea of vision is 
heresy. After two twins are born with sight, the 
Witch Hunters — a savage royal raiding party 
that hunts down heretics, such as those who 
practice witchcraft or speak of vision — come 
for them. The leader of the Alkenny village, 
Baba Voss (Jason Momoa, “Game of Thrones”) 
attempts to lead his people to a new promised 
land.
The aforementioned scene is not terrifying 
at all, which is the main problem with “See.” 
When the characters comes upon a bridge and 
wonder what it is, if it’s there or if it’s safe, the 
suspense is ruined because we can obviously see 
the bridge. The show has an overly-capable cast. 
Jason Momoa does a great job at playing another 
grisly, grunting Jason Momoa character. Other 
characters excel as believably blind villagers 
in a sightless, post-apocalyptic forest, if that 
makes any sense. It’s clear from the way actors 
deliver their lines where the tension lies, even 
if the mythology of the show isn’t always clear.
The mythology is, perhaps, the next biggest 
problem. That, and the show’s confounded 
dedication to its own aesthetic. Visually, “See” 
is stunning. The tall, evergreen forests of 
British Columbia make a beautiful backdrop for 
the show’s collection of atavistic characters. 
Even the fur-clad villagers are beautiful (if only 
they could see themselves). Yet, the show goes 
to great lengths to assert its aesthetic, which is 
a mash up between “Vikings” and “10,000 BC.” 
This loyalty to its look comes at the expense of 
storytelling technique. The mythology muddles 
the show. In the first episode, at least, the idea 
of vision being heresy is not sold very well, aside 

from a title card at the beginning of the show. It 
doesn’t even make sense why the Witch Hunters 
are after the villagers until much later, which 
makes the first half unusually confusing.
“See” unfortunately crumbles because of its 
lack of vision. There’s nothing about the show 
that is extraordinary or groundbreaking. It’s 
very normal. This makes it difficult to relate 
to a cast that is completely blind. There are 
obviously sensory talents in certain characters, 
such as Ilun (Sharon Taylor, “Smallville”) who 
can count distance in heartbeats. This makes 
me wonder if “See” couldn’t include these 
sensory enhancements in the show. By making 
sound louder, describing smell, messing with 
the way we understand the show visually, the 
story could become enhanced. Viewers could 
be more deeply drawn into a show that is more 
experimental with how it tells its story.
The true blindness of “See” is the fact that 
Apple failed to realize that there’s more to TV 
than a few good actors and a somewhat fresh 
story. There are hundreds of shows for viewers 
to choose from. As a visual form, television is 
not just about the story, but the way that the 
story is told.

Nico Collins and the test of reaching a ceiling

 Three years after Nico Collins 
graduated 
Clay-Chalkville 
High School in the suburbs of 
Birmingham, Ala., Jerry Hood’s 
pride still bubbles up every time he 
watches Michigan play.
For four years, Collins terrorized 
defenses with the athleticism and 
imposing frame that made him one 
of the most talented players Hood 
has coached. Watching from the 
stands all those years, Hood’s kids 
idolized Collins and watched in 
awe as he accounted for 2,773 yards 
and 40 touchdowns in his career 
with Clay-Chalkville.
So now, when they watch 
Michigan together, their pride is a 
family affair.
“My kids still look at the TV, 
‘Where’s Nico?’ Hood said. “… It’s 
really fun to watch.”
Thousands 
of 
miles 
away 
in Ann Arbor, Michigan fans 
find 
themselves 
asking 
the 
same question every week. For 
them, it’s a matter of frustration, 
sparked by the contrast of Collins’ 
generational talent paired against 
his inconsistent usage.
It’s a frustration that rears 
its head when Collins inevitably 
breaks downfield, positions himself 
perfectly and pinpoints a deep ball 
against an overmatched defensive 
back, before going untargeted for 
drives at a time as the Wolverines’ 
offense sputters.
“He adds a dynamic element to 
our offense to where you have to 
pay attention to him every snap,” 
senior quarterback Shea Patterson 
said after last week’s win over 
Maryland. “And most of the time 
when he’s one-on-one, he’s going to 
go up and get it.”
That afternoon summed up 
Collins’ season, as he brought down 
a key 51-yard reception late in the 
second quarter — and then finished 
with no catches the rest of the way.
Against 
Maryland, 
Collins 
knew when his opportunity was 
coming. 
All 
week, 
Michigan 
had gameplanned to exploit the 
Terrapins’ Cover-6 defense, with 

Collins having half the field to work 
against freshman safety Treron 
Williams.
“That was just the coverage 
we’ve been game-planning for all 
week, and we just hit it over the 
top,” Patterson said.
The play, of course, worked, 
going for 51 yards off play-action 
and setting up a rushing touchdown 
two plays later. It also epitomized 
how Michigan likes to use Collins 
as a deep threat — sparingly and 
against looks that the Wolverines 
know he can exploit.
Of Collins’ three 40-plus yard 
receptions this year, two came in 
the first five minutes of games, 
when a team’s offensive plays are 
often scripted. All three times, the 
deep shots were isolated plays in 
games where he was mostly used 
underneath, providing a departure 
from his high school days when 
Collins’ size meant he could be 
targeted at will.
“We felt like, if they were not 
double-covering him, that we were 
available to take a shot at any time,” 
Hood said. “… He’s just a mismatch, 
man.”
Developing 
beyond 
his 
trademark size has been Collins’ 
primary focus throughout his three 
years at Michigan. He arrived 
in 2017 as an enticing but raw 
prospect, with the athleticism that 
made him the rare four-star wide 

receiver recruit who hadn’t posted 
a single 1,000-yard season in high 
school.
In 
a 
largely 
anonymous 
freshman season, he finished with 
just three catches for 27 yards, 
but set the path for a breakout 
sophomore year by developing 
into an all-around receiver. Now 
working with offensive coordinator 
Josh Gattis — a renowned wide 
receivers coach at previous stops — 
Collins has continued that process 
with a focus on his route-running, 
foot placement and pad level.
“I learn a lot from coach Gattis,” 
Collins said. “He really harps on 
details, technique, pad level. So 
he really knows what he’s talking 
about, we just gotta trust it.”
The 
results, 
though, 
have 
remained well short of Collins’ 
high ceiling, with his 439 yards 
and three touchdowns through 
nine games putting him on a near-
identical pace to last season. And 
with flashes that he could be so 
much more, that’s an unsatisfying 
reality.
“What surprises me a little bit is 
that they sometimes don’t run curls 
or different short routes for him 
that would set that kind of (deep 
shot) up,” Hood said. “(Michigan 
has) so many great receivers that 
it’s hard for a team to double-cover 
him.”
Hood is careful to note that he’s 

not criticizing the Wolverines’ 
coaching staff. Even watching from 
afar, the strides in Collins’ game 
are obvious — “Goodness gracious, 
those guys do an awesome job 
coaching,” he said. But his point 
meshes with the general consensus: 
use Collins more and the results 
will follow.
Ask Collins himself and his 
agreement is implicit.
“A lot of people say I’m a deep 
threat, (and) it’s kinda true, but I 
can run a lot of routes,” Collins said. 
“Slants, curls, whatever. Any route 
on the route tree, I can do it all.”
Still, Collins’ ability as a deep 
threat remains his calling card. It’s 
what makes him a likely Day Two 
NFL Draft pick in the future and 
the focus of opposing defenses in 
the present. And as he stood on an 
empty field at Maryland Stadium 
on Saturday, it’s what brought a 
smile to his often-stoic face.
“I feel my go-to is the deep ball,” 
Collins said. “I love deep balls, 
man. I like getting my team, the 
offense, an opportunity to score 
the ball.”
The challenge for Michigan 
is optimizing that ability. And as 
Collins enters what could be the 
last three games of his college 
career without a 100-yard game 
and 144th in the country in 
receiving yards, that’s the issue 
the Wolverines have to solve.

Junior receiver Nico Collins made just one catch against Maryland, but it went for 51 yards on a deep ball.

Wolverines studying NHL power plays to improve

When Bill Muckalt cues up 
film for his power-play units 
to watch, he doesn’t always 
turn to the film bank Michigan 
maintains of its own games and 
practices. Instead, the associate 
head coach pulls together clips 
from the highest level of the 
sport. 
As 
the 
Wolverines 
work 
with a new power-play system 
under Muckalt’s 
guidance 
— 
moving from a 
unit with three 
forwards 
and 
two defensemen 
to four forwards 
and 
one 
defenseman 
— 
Michigan’s time 
in the film room 
has been spent 
watching 
how 
NHL teams run their power 
plays.
“I 
think 
it’s 
no 
secret, 
people and pucks to the net, 
take the goalie’s eyes away,” 
Muckalt said. “That’s a good 
recipe to generate, but I think 
specifically, when we watch 
NHL teams and watch what 
they’re doing is — part of our 
job is to develop players to the 

National Hockey League and 
watching the best players, the 
game is still the same but it’s at 
a different speed and a different 
execution. … You watch smart 
offensive players and it’s kind 
of a copycat league and you take 
ideas.”
Michigan has spent the most 
time watching the Vancouver 
Canucks, who run a similar 
system, but Muckalt was quick 
to clarify that he thinks there’s 
something to be learned from 
every team in the 
league. 
While 
most teams run 
variations of a 
1-3-1 formation, 
each team has 
its own spin on 
it 
and 
creates 
different looks.
And 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
try 
to figure out how 
to make the new 
system work for them, watching 
teams across the NHL is helping 
them see what their options are.
“We’re just trying to simplify 
on the power play, get pucks 
on net and move it quick,” said 
sophomore defenseman Nick 
Blankenburg on Oct. 25. “Film 
has been a big thing for us that 
we’ve been doing is watching 
how other teams are scoring 

goals on power plays. I think we 
find areas to score through film 
and whatnot and just seeing 
what’s open.”
The transition hasn’t gone 
perfectly. 
Michigan 
has 
six power-play goals on 34 
opportunities though its first 
eight games — good for a 17.6 
percent conversion rate with 
a man advantage, which ranks 
No. 28 of 60 teams in the 
country.
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
has said he cares 
more 
about 
when the power-
play 
goals 
come than the 
percentage 
at 
which the units 
convert, 
but 
eight games in, 
neither 
metric 
is reflecting the 
performance 
Pearson 
would 
like to see.
In Saturday’s game at Ohio 
State, 
the 
Wolverines 
had 
two power plays in the third 
period while trailing by a goal. 
Michigan notched a combined 
three 
shots 
across 
both 
opportunities, and only one of 
those shots came directly in 
front of the net.
“We’ve gotta find something 

that 
works, 
because 
these 
games are coming down to 
one goal and special teams are 
so important,” Pearson said. 
“We’ve lost the special teams 
battle in the last three games. 
We’ve lost every game.”
Both units have seen their 
personnel change depending 
on health and the different 
line 
combinations 
Pearson 
puts 
together. 
Freshman 
defenseman 
Cam 
York 
has 
solidified himself on the top 
unit, as has fifth-year forward 
Jacob Hayhurst. But everything 
else is in flux — including the 
system itself.
At the beginning of the 
season, both groups featured 
a lone defenseman and four 
forwards. 
Now, 
sophomore 
defensemen Jack Summers and 
Nick Blankenburg are usually 
sent with the second unit 
alongside three forwards. 
On 
Friday, 
it 
was 
that 
second unit that produced the 
weekend’s lone power-play goal 
for the Wolverines.
“I think most teams are kinda 
transitioning toward (having 
two looks) because then you 
have to study two different 
types of film,” said senior 
forward Nick Pastujov. “Like 
for Ohio State, for instance, 
the way we studied them was 
the first and second unit, they 
run two different things, so 
your 
(penalty 
kill) 
always 
has 
to 
kinda 
kill 
differently 
against the two 
and sometimes 
you can get out 
of sorts if you 
get confused.
“It just gives 
that extra little 
edge where if 
we give them 
two different looks, they might 
not catch on as fast and we 
might be able to catch them.”
While Michigan works to 
find the successful formula 
for both power-play units, the 
systems and the personnel will 
be fluid. But as the Wolverines 
study the NHL to figure things 
out, they may find just the right 
thing to copy.

The Michigan hockey team has looked to the National Hockey League for help with its struggling power play.

Part of our job 
is to develop 
players to the 
(NHL).

We’ve gotta 
find something 
that works (on 
the power play).

What Slaker’s injury 
absence meant for ‘M’

There 
was 
a 
heightened 
sense of urgency at Yost Ice 
Arena late Tuesday afternoon. 
Throughout 
practice, 
voices 
were louder, whistles more 
purposeful, 
huddles 
more 
frequent, and then, to top it 
off, the Michigan hockey team 
closed out with intense goal-
line-to-goal-line conditioning.
The Wolverines are coming 
off three road losses. First, 
a 4-1 loss to then-No. 18 
Western Michigan in a hostile 
environment, where the team 
fell behind moments after the 
puck drop. And last weekend 
Michigan got swept by No. 9 
Ohio State, losing both affairs 
by 
one 
goal 
and 
looking 
somewhat out of sorts.
“There’s not much room for 
mistakes right now, especially 
coming off three losses,” said 
senior forward Will Lockwood. 
“Attention to detail is huge. 
I think our coaches are just 
holding us accountable to that.”
Finding the root cause of 
the losses is challenging, as 
each game was unique. One 
commonality, though, is that 
senior forward Jake Slaker was 
absent due to an undisclosed 
injury. Last season, he tallied 
25 points. He looks suited to 
return this weekend for the 
home series against Minnesota, 
but over the last two weekends, 
his absence made a mark.
Offensive 
struggles 
were 
quite apparent in the recent 
series. The Wolverines couldn’t 
keep control of the puck in the 
attacking zone and thus had a 
hard time generating consistent 
scoring 
chances. 
Lockwood 
notes that with the chances 
they did get, capitalizing was a 
hurdle.
Slaker sees himself as a vocal, 
high-energy player for whom 
speed is a key asset. While it’s 
unlikely he would’ve solved all 
of Michigan’s problems, that 
skill set could have provided 
the offense a key burst.
“Just from knowing him 
well he’s a natural goalscorer,” 
Lockwood 
said. 
“Even 
in 
practice recently, he’s been 
lighting up our goalies pretty 

much all practice, and I think 
when he comes back he’s gonna 
be hungry. He hasn’t scored 
yet, but he’s someone who can 
put the puck in the net at ease. 
So I think those one-goal games 
could have been different if he 
were in the lineup.”
Watching from the sidelines 
is something new for Slaker. 
He was a contributor ever since 
joining the program, and in his 
first three years missed just one 
game. Missing extended time 
has taken some getting used to.
“It’s 
definitely 
tough, 
especially after the last few 
games,” 
Slaker 
said. 
“We 
haven’t won, so it’s tough not to 
be able to be out there and try to 
help the team come out with a 
win or something. But there’s a 
lot of learning you can do from 
watching the games.”
Slaker hasn’t watched many 
hockey games, only tape. Sitting 
out lets him weigh what works 
well for other players with what 
doesn’t, and he understands 
this could improve his own 
game.
Off the ice, Slaker has made 
sure to stay involved with the 
team. He was quick to offer his 
thoughts on the Wolverines’ 
play.
“I 
know 
Slaker 
was 
critiquing,” 
Lockwood 
said. 
“He’d come in between periods 
and say this and that, and after 
games 
he’d 
have 
different 
opinions on things because 
you kind of get a different 
perspective when you’re up in 
the stands, and you can see the 
game a little bit better. So he 
had a lot of insight to that and 
it was a good help to the team.”
As 
an 
alternate 
captain, 
Slaker 
continues 
to 
be 
outspoken while not playing. 
He’s central to team meetings 
and 
always 
tries 
to 
give 
his 
teammates 
the 
energy 
and advice that they need. 
Regardless, Michigan prefers 
having him on the ice.
“He’s a big leader for our 
team, and he brings a lot 
to the table offensively and 
defensively,” Lockwood said. 
“To have a senior leader out of 
the lineup always hurts you. 
We look forward to him coming 
back.”

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
Senior forward Jake Slaker plans to return from injury this weekend.


Jon Teske was cooking and the 
Michigan faithful inside Crisler 
Center couldn’t get enough. 
With nine points in the opening 
2:40, the senior center pulled up 
from the wing for a heat-check 
3-pointer. Though it clanked off the 
front rim, Teske, and the rest of the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
(1-0), oozed with confidence. 
“Coach (Juwan Howard) drew 
up a lot of good plays and fortunately 
enough, I was able to finish around 
the rim,” Teske said. “My teammates 
were finding me and I was just using 
my height advantage — they were 
kinda small in the frontcourt.”
Following in the senior’s lead, 
junior guard Eli Brooks knocked 
down two shots from behind the 
arc while sophomore wing Adrien 
Nunez converted on a stepback 
jumper from the elbow. By the first 
media timeout, the Wolverines had 
quickly tallied 16 points against 
a stunned Appalachian State and 
blown the roof off the building. 
The 
utter 
delirium 
that 
characterized the first 20 minutes 
of 
Howard’s 
inaugural 
game 
eventually gave way to frustration 
and concern in the second half, as a 
slew of turnovers and missed shots 
almost cost the Wolverines the 
game. 
Ultimately, Michigan overcame 
its near collapse, winning, 79-71, 
against the Mountaineers (0-1) 
in a hard-fought, yet thoroughly 
unconvincing opener. 
Keeping 
the 
pace 
high 
— 
something Howard has emphasized 
so far in practice — and the defensive 
intensity up, the Wolverines opened 
up a substantial lead early on. 
“The 
pace 
was 
important,” 
Brooks said. “We were getting up 
and down the floor. Not letting them 
get set up.”
Accompanying Teske’s 15 first-
half points was a frenetic defensive 
performance. 
Michigan’s 
hands 
were seemingly in every passing 
lane, slapping the ball away and 
stealing possessions. 
During one sequence, sophomore 
forward Colin Castleton nicked it 
away from Appalachian State guard 
Donovan Gregory, leading to a wide-
open three for junior forward Isaiah 
Livers on the other end. 
In total, the Wolverines forced 
12 first-half turnovers on the 
Mountaineers, to go with multiple 
low-percentage desperation shots. 
Coming 
out 
of 
the 
break, 
Michigan expanded its 21-point 
advantage with two corner threes 
from Brooks — who finished with a 
team-high 24 points — and an easy 
baseline alley-oop from sophomore 
guard David DeJulius to Livers. 
And then, the game turned. 
Thanks 
to 
uncharacteristic 
turnovers from Livers and senior 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson, 
poor 
shooting and defensive miscues, 
Appalachian 
State 
mounted 
a 
comeback. 
“We were trying to make a quick 
shot,” Teske said. “We just have to 
share the ball, move the ball and 
use the shot clock more. We had a 
lot of silly turnovers in the second 
half trying to force passes that aren’t 
there. If it’s not there, we just need 
to pull the ball out and run more 
offense” 
The Mountaineers went on a 27-3 
tear over an eight-minute stretch 
and cut the deficit to just four points 
with 20 seconds remaining. 
Facing a full-blown debacle, 
Michigan 
made 
enough 
plays 
down the stretch to stave off the 
comeback. Simpson and Brooks 
were steady enough at the helm, 
while Livers converted a second-
chance layup under the basket with 
1:31 remaining to increase the lead to 
eight and give the Wolverines some 
breathing room.
In the end, it was far from 
straightforward. Still, a win is a win. 
The Wolverines held on to give 
Howard his first victory on the 
sidelines at Michigan — and a lot of 
practice material. 
“It’s our first game,” Teske said. 
“It’s a long season. We’re going 
to learn from this. We’re going to 
grow from this. We still got a lot of 
improvement to do and that’s what 
practice is for. We’ll come back this 
week and we’ll get better.”

‘M’ holds 
on to top 
App State, 
79-71

On the 
sideline, 
Howard 
settles in

As the final minutes of the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
season-opening 
79-71 
victory over Appalachian State 
ran off the clock on Tuesday, 
Juwan Howard was in his 
element. His imposing frame cast 
a long reflection over the shining 
hardwood 
floors 
at 
Crisler 
Center, his long arms stretched 
as he signaled to his players, his 
face was animated as he shouted 
directions over the chaos of the 
Maize Rage behind him.
Just a couple hours earlier, 
the newly-minted head coach’s 
body language told a much-
different 
story. 
He 
wavered 
between sitting and standing 
for much of the beginning of 
the game – his first at the helm 
of this Michigan team. Sitting, 
he craned as far forward as he 
seemed physically capable of 
doing, trying to get a read on the 
court. Standing, he looked tense. 
His long arms either hung by his 
sides or fidgeted with his tie or 
the button of his jacket, but his 
body leaned forward as if he was 
physically restraining himself 
from running onto the court. 
It was Howard’s first time as 
a head coach outside the NBA’s 
Summer League, and at times 
it’s showed, most notably (and 
most recently) when he named 
three different recruits in a press 
conference on Monday, violating 
NCAA rules. But as the the clock 
hit zero at Crisler on Tuesday 
night, Howard looked as much 
at home leading the Wolverines 
from the sidelines as he once 
looked leading them on the 
court.
“He’s always teaching. He 
loves to teach,” said senior 
center Jon Teske. “He’s giving 
us feedback, just continuing that 
trust we have. He loves to teach, 
and that translated to the game 
today, too.”
There are a lot of high 
expectations that go hand-in-
hand with a member of the Fab 
Five coming back to Ann Arbor 
to replace the best basketball 
coach in school history. Howard 
is well aware of what his hiring 
represents. He expects a lot of his 
team, and even more of himself. 
“There are areas where not 
just our players have to improve, 
but me as a coach,” Howard said. 
“That’s part of the process; I 
separate myself from the group. 
As a coach, I keep going back, 
hopefully I get some sleep 
tonight. Hopefully I will not play 
every play and possession back in 
my head. I know I will definitely 
have some sleep disturbances, 
because I have that mindset. I’m 
always critical. I’m always hard 
on myself.”
And so, as Howard drew 
ever closer to the first win of 
his head-coaching tenure, ever 
closer to ushering in what will 
one day be known in Ann Arbor 
as the Juwan Howard Era, his 
energy was almost palpable: no 
longer tentative or cautious, but 
excited, confident and most of 
all, hungry.
It was just an eight-point 
victory for a team that held 
a 30-point lead at one point. 
These Wolverines can do better, 
and will need to do better 
against tougher teams down 
the road. They’ll need to pass 
cleaner, shoot more effectively 
and turn the ball over less —
among other things — if they 
want to be a relevant team in 
March. Howard knows it will 
be a challenge.
But he’s ready for it.
“Absolutely, I feel extremely 
comfortable 
and 
confident 
being the leader of this team,” 
Howard said. “Because I care. 
(I) care about this game, care 
what happens, care about this 
team, how we can improve.”
There 
are 
plenty 
more 
questions Howard will have 
to answer over the course of 
the season. But as for a head-
coaching style, a leadership 
personality?
That’s coming along just fine.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 30, 2019

I 

used to keep Tinder in the games 
folder on my phone. No, really, it held 
the first spot, the top left, followed by 
Tiny Wings and Words with Friends. 
“I downloaded Tinder because I was 
bored” is a good lie I tell myself. After my 
sophomore year of college, I moved home 
for the summer, and the novelty of living 
in my childhood bedroom was wearing off. 
My friends were either working 9-to-5 jobs 
or studying abroad, leaving me to my own 
devices — in this case, my phone.
After my first long-term relationship 
ended earlier that year, I needed a quick fix 
for affirmations. It turned out that Tinder 
was a free slot machine that spit out semi-
creepy messages and heart-eye emojis every 
few swipes.
I’ve always had a problem with phone 
games. As a kid, I cycled through apps like 
relationships; I became infatuated with 
them, then obsessive, then eventually had 
to delete them after they started becoming 
a toxic presence in my life. I had a phase 
with Restaurant Story and Smurfs Village in 
middle school, which required that I get up 
in the middle of the night to tend to my vir-
tual estates. In high school, I played Guitar 
Hero III with my boyfriend every time I was 
at his house, hoping to level up.
For my friends and me, Tinder was also a 
game. We would swap phones and swipe for 
each other, gawking at the white boys hold-
ing fish and their shirtless mirror selfies. 
Some put photos of girls in their profiles as if 
to prove women had been attracted to them 
at one point. Their bios were typically that 
one quote from “The Office” everyone loves 
but isn’t funny. Swipe left.
Soon, I found myself swiping passively, 
then compulsively. I would swipe at night 
and wouldn’t fall asleep until I got one more 
match. It wasn’t that I wanted to meet with 
any of these people, or even talk to them — 
I just wanted them to talk to me. The more 
messages that accumulated in my inbox, the 
more I felt I was leveling up.
Then I found Drew. In his first photo, 
he was petting a puppy with one hand and 
holding a ukulele in the other. Fifty-six 
miles away. “College baseball player, puppy 
father, 
aspiring 
pediatrician, 
novelist, 
INFJ.” I swiped right so fast. We seemed too 
compatible — we were both writers, loved 

dogs, played the ukulele and even had the 
same Myers-Briggs personality type.
Had my swiping paid off somehow?
We matched. I messaged him and we met 
for bubble tea in Ferndale. He showed me 
his poetry, which wasn’t terrible. I thought 
he was cute. We decided to have another 
date.
“Let’s play ukulele together!” he sug-
gested as we parted ways. “I could show you 
the metropark by my house. You can meet 
my dog, too!” It sounded romantic enough. I 
drove home with the sunset behind me and 
realized I had a real crush on him.
I 

didn’t tell my mom where I was going 
before packing up her car and driving 
56 miles to Drew’s house. I was met 
with a side hug. Once inside, I met the puppy 
from his profile, which immediately peed on 
the ground.
“Mo-om,” Drew called and left, leaving 
me in the front room with a small puddle of 
urine. I opened Tinder to do some anxious 
swiping.
A girl’s bare torso filled my screen. Half 
of a boy’s face. A close-up of someone’s lips. 
Body parts came and went as I swiped in a 
rapid fire.
Drew returned with his ukulele and 
drove us to the metropark. We sat in the 
middle of the picnic area, completely sur-
rounded by suburban families. When the 
time came to play ukulele together, Drew 
began shaking as he tried to strum a chord. 
It looked foreign in his hands. That’s when it 
hit me — this boy doesn’t actually know how 
to play the ukulele.
I ended up giving him a free lesson, after 
which he became frustrated and asked me 
to play a song. Very aware of the families 
surrounding us in a 360-degree stage, I sang 
as quietly as possible. Our audience heard 
and started clapping. I announced we were 
leaving immediately.
We went to a drive-thru ice cream place 
where Drew ordered Flamin’ Hot Cheetos 
soft-serve, then took us to a baseball field for 
his dog to run around. Drew took one bite of 
his ice cream then spit it out onto the gravel. 
I watched in horror as he called the puppy 
to finish it.
The dog demolished the cone, leaving only 
orange specks on his nose. I opened Tinder 
again with my phone tilted away from Drew 

and continued swiping, faster this time.
Somehow, Drew decided this was the 
correct time to kiss me. I quickly locked my 
phone as he put his mouth on mine, and the 
cheesy dust on his lips burned the inside of 
my cheek. It was the only spark I felt when 
he kissed me.
We sat in silence for a few minutes as his 
dog ran laps around us. Finally, Drew invit-
ed me back to his house to play Guitar Hero 
III. I smirked.
We played a few rounds of “Reptilia” by 
The Strokes before tackling “Through the 
Fire and Flames” by DragonForce. Four 
minutes in, a figure walked downstairs and 
almost made me drop my plastic guitar.
Drew’s dad, a short white man, was hold-
ing the scariest chainsaw I had ever seen. 
The light from the TV cast a shadow that 
made him resemble the final boss in a video 
game. But this wasn’t a game anymore. 
I should have told my mom where I was.
I 
watched, 
petrified, 
as 
the 
man 
approached us, turned on the machine, 
and started sawing a slab of wood behind 

the couch. Drew didn’t even turn around. I 
jerked my body back and saw that he had an 
entire workshop right there behind us. 
“Hey, you’re missing your solo,” Drew 
yelled over the noise.
“I can’t hear!” DragonForce swelled as 
the chainsaw made contact with the wood, 
emitting a crackling screech like newly-
caught prey. The noise stopped as soon as it 
had begun, and Drew’s dad calmly climbed 
the stairs again with his two large pieces of 
wood.
I jumped up, shaken. “I need to leave,” I 
said and grabbed my bag. Fifty-six miles. I 
drove 56 miles for this.
In the car, I hastily deleted my Tinder 
app, but knew I would download it again 
within a few weeks. It took me another five 
months to realize I couldn’t win and cut it 
off for good.
As I merged onto the highway, I saw 
the faintest sunset in my rearview mirror. 
Bright orange filtered through the dark 
clouds like dying tinder in a fire. I laughed.
All the clouds were shaped like Cheetos.

Modern Love: Tinder a real life love game

A

s I walked to my art history class, 
a poster hanging in the Diag read, 
“What will you do when machines do 
everything?” Carrying in my mind all of the 
impressionist paintings I had to memorize 
for this exam, I thought surely the visual 
arts could never be done by a computer. The 
level of emotion and resolve that goes into a 
work of art seems incompatible with the idea 
of computing. Computers are best at doing 
rote tasks over and over again, freeing up 
people to leverage the creative ingenuity of 
the human mind. I thought there would be no 
way for a computer to develop its own works 
of art, since it required a level of thought and 
deliberation unknown to an everyday laptop 
computer.
Or so I thought. According to an article 
I read in The Atlantic recently, artificial 
intelligence is now capable of developing its 
own works of art after being fed thousands 
of images. These machines are able to 
detect patterns in the works and make a 
similar piece, albeit a blurry mass of color 
attempting 
to 
resemble 
a 
Renaissance 
portrait. That emotion and intelligence I 
believed exclusive to humans may no longer 
be ours exclusively, as computers are now 
capable of taking in information in a way that 
resembles human thinking. This 
may allow them to eventually 
develop works on their own 
and possibly become the 
new arbiters of art taste. If 
art, the beacon of creativity, 
could still fall prey to the 
unrelenting 
monster 
of 
computation, I feared 
nothing would be safe 
in its path.
But the knowledge 
I 
gained 
from 
taking 
that 
art 
class on French 
modernism 
in 
the 19th century 
stopped 
me 
from 
immediately 
deploring 
this 
new 
development. My professor 
reminded us all of the time 
that many of the artworks 
we 
studied 
took 
their 
inspiration from paintings 
that came before them. In 
fact, some painters, like 
Manet, literally copied 
elements 
from 
old 
paintings and pasted 
them into his own, 

something a computer could easily do. 
For example, Manet, an admirer of the 
Spanish masters such as Velázquez and Goya, 
literally moved the crowd from one of Goya’s 
bullfighting scenes to his own Execution 
of Maximilien. But, instead of the crowd 
peering over the ring, they were peering over 
a wall while they watched the soldiers shoot 
the prisoners. The presence of the faceless 
soldiers standing in lockstep, away from the 
viewer, is essentially taken from Goya’s The 
Third of May 1808. 
Many of the paintings we studied in 
class either copied or transposed elements 
from older paintings and made them into 
something of their own, but with a new 
style reflecting their own period. Put this 
way, it does not sound at all far-fetched that 
a computer could eventually do the same, 
given it can already recognize patterns and 
understand which paintings belong to which 
period of art. 
Creating a new style from old elements, 
however, gives me pause as to how successful 
artificial intelligence can be in replicating 
new art. While it might be able to see trends 
in data, I don’t think AI will be able to predict 
the next trend in art. For example, I don’t 
see the technology eventually gaining 
enough human foresight to 
make a leap equivalent 
to the shift from realism 
to impressionism in the 
19th century. Nor will 
I think a computer 
will 
be 
able 
to 
know 
which 

elements it should take from another painting 
in devising its own creation. 
Manet, in painting his work Olympia, put his 
model on the same bed with the same shade 
of red as Titian’s Venus of Urbino, right down 
to the same untucked sheet in the lower left-
hand corner. How would a computer know 
that it wants to put its art on the same plane 
as the renowned Renaissance painters and 
so remind the viewer of a painting from that 
period? If it somehow was sensitive to the 
opinions of its human critics, how would it 
know which elements to include and in what 
form so as to make that connection in the 
mind of the viewer? Given these difficulties, 
I don’t believe computers could make the 
same works of art that measure up to the 
standards of humans. So, rest assured, I don’t 
think machines are coming for the painters 
anytime soon.
But what if there is a third path — neither 
a 
complete 
replacement 
of 
artists 
by 
computers, or a Luddite-like destruction of 
technology that is capable of making art? 
What if art could instead be used to enhance 
the creative process, making the idea of 
looking 
to 
the past for inspiration 
a lot easier with the 
power of a computer? 
A few days ago, my 
sister sent me a link for an 
art exhibition she was seeing 
titled “Machine Hallucination”, 
which uses machine learning to 
process thousands of images of 
New York City architecture and 
thereby make connections between 
different structures made in different 
time periods. Instead of destroying art, 
computers could instead enhance how we 
view art and allow us to make insights we 
could not make without it.
For me, someone who is looking to embrace 
both a creative side of writing and a technical 
field, this sounds like the perfect 
harmony. I hope, like many other 
tasks throughout human history, 
machines make the process of 
creating new content — such 
as these articles — easier and, 
possibly, even better.

Wednesday, November 6, 2019 // The Statement

I 

wrote so I could say I was truly paying 
attention,” 
writer 
and 
poet 
Sarah 
Manguso explained. These verbs should 
be past tense, but since they’re all present tense, 
I’ll let you decide if 
you want to change 
them all. As long as 
they’re 
consistent 
in her 2015 book 
“Ongoingness: 
The 
End 
of 
a 
Diary.” 
“Experience in 
itself 
wasn’t 
enough. 
The 
diary was my 
defense against 
waking up at the 
end 
of 
my 
life 
and realizing I’d 
missed it.”
Like Manguso, 
I want to feel as if 
I’m paying careful 
attention to my 
life, and keeping 
a diary seems like 
a good way to do 
it. “There should 
be 
extra 
days, 
buffer 
days, 
between the real 
days,” Manguso 
wrote. I want 
this, too: a break 
from 
time, 
a 
little 
pocket 
of 
nothing 
in 
which to figure 
out the fullness 
of 
the 
days. 
Writing in my 
journal 
might 
be the closest 
I can get to 
a break. But 
diary-keeping 
serves 
other 
purposes, too, 

and I’m trying to figure out what those are. 
“Introspection is not as reliable as observation,” 
writes essayist Louis Menard in his article “Woke 
Up This Morning,” which appeared in The New 
Yorker in 2007. In the piece, Menard tried to 
puzzle out diaries — why we keep them, and why 
we like to read other people’s. Menard argued 
that diaries aren’t a particularly 
trustworthy record of the diarist’s 
inner life. Instead, he supposed 
that diary-keeping might reflect 
various psychological needs or 
imbalances, and are thus tainted 
by the purpose the journal serves 
for the writer.
Menard drew on a few Freudian 
ideas, including the ego theory 
(“It obliges you to believe that 
the stuff that happened to you 
is worth writing down because 
it happened to you”) and the id 
theory, which proposes diaries 
as a tool for recording desires 
and 
failures 
that 
cannot 
be 
publicly expressed. Next comes 
the superego theory: “When we 
describe the day’s events and our 
management of them, we have 
in mind a wise and benevolent 
reader who will someday see 
that we played, on the whole, and 
despite the best efforts of selfish 
and unworthy colleagues and 
relations, a creditable game with 
the hand we were dealt.”
I’ve kept a diary since I was 
seven or eight years old, and I 
think all of these theories 
might be true, to some 
extent. I write to 
figure out how I 
feel, and in doing 
so, 
I 
feel 
I’m 
justifying things 
— to myself, a future 
version of me who’ll 
read 
the 
diary, 
or 
to 
someone who might stumble 
on it years after my death. But 
how accurate is the rendering of 
myself that I’ll reread, 30 years down 

the line? I think it’s possible Menard is right that 
the picture is not very accurate at all. Sometimes, 
I’ll write something down in my diary about the 
way I’m feeling or an interaction with a friend, 
and know that I haven’t got it quite right.
According to Menard, diaries are inaccurate, 
possibly ego-driven (or id-driven, or superego-
driven) records. What, then, is the point in 
keeping them? What’s the point of reading 
them? Even if a diary is shaped by unconscious 
desires, even if it’s a blatant attempt to create 
the sort of person you want to be, I 
think it still reflects something 
important about who you were 
at the moment of writing: 
insecure, sad, confused, 
thrilled. Rereading a diary 
might not help current-me 
remember what past-me was 
like, but it’ll remind me of who 
I wanted to be. Diary entries are 
always a reflection of something 
true, even if that truth isn’t always 
communicated obtusely.
I’m thinking of a song by Evan 
Dando called “Hard Drive”: “This is 
the bed I’m sleeping in / This is the 
shirt I’m buttoning / This is the pace 
I’m moving at / This is the tune I’m 
humming now / This is the road I’m 
walkin’ down,” he sings, cataloguing his 
life the way one might in a diary. “Have 
you ever felt yourself in motion?” he continues. 
“It reminds me of the way writing in a diary or 
rereading one can sometimes feel: a fall back to 
yourself, a reminder of the currents of change 
beneath everything.” 
S

ome years I wrote in my diary every single 
day, but there have also been periods 
when weeks or months passed with only 
a few lines. I recently finished the diary I’d been 
using since my sophomore year of high school. 
The first entry is dated Monday, Feb. 9, 2015, 
10:10 p.m.
“Okay day,” I wrote. “Got 97 on Art History 
test (Mannerism, High Renaissance) but math 
quiz was so hard!!! Get to finish it in the morning 
because the other class took it in a double and we 
only had a single. Alex still hasn’t asked me to 
junior prom. Trip to Gettysburg this week!” 
In an article about nostalgia, journalist Haley 

Nahman wrote about the way her memory shifts 
to fit changing stories about her life. 
“I compartmentalize it and then piece it back 
together in whatever arrangement suits my 
chosen narrative (I was happy. I was inspired. I 
was broken),” she wrote. 
I do this, too, but when I reread my diaries, 
it feels both comforting and unsettling to be 
presented with a rough approximation of how it 
was to be 17 (or 10, or 13, or 20). But the rush 
of memory and nostalgia that accompanies 
rereading my diaries always feel buffered by the 
things I didn’t yet know when I was writing. I 
didn’t know on February 9, 2015, that I’d go to 
junior prom with Will, not Alex, and that he’d 
kiss me on the forehead at the after-party, and 
we’d watch the Mr. Bean movie, and I’d want 
to go home. Or that I’d never be very good at 
math, but it wouldn’t really matter. How 
can I remember anything accurately, 
when every memory is tainted or 
softened by what came after?
There’s 
a 
concept 
in 
psychology called peak-end 
theory, 
which 
proposes 
that the way we remember 
something — a relationship, 
a road trip, a job — is based on 
the most intense emotional 
aspect of that thing and the 
way it ended, rather than an 
average of every emotional high 
and low. I’m especially interested in 
the idea that endings could unravel or revive a 
memory. A lovely vacation could end in a bitter 
argument, and the fight is what you’d remember. 
An awful day could close with an unexpected 
moment of joy, and all the pain would fall to the 
wayside. A fulfilling friendship might fall apart 
in a painful way, and the hurt is what would 
stand out. 
It seems unfair that the way something 
ends could ruin the rest of it, but this is the 
double-edged sword of memory, and of endings. 
Heartbreak, grief, disappointment, anger: They 
don’t seem so awful if everything turned out ok 
in the end. Happiness is likewise changed by 
whatever happened next — a death, a breakup, an 
argument taken too far. Montages of picnics and 
parties and inside jokes can spoil so easily. This 
is partly why it feels important to me to write 

everything 
down, 
even the feelings 
I 
know 
are 
temporary. 

Otherwise, 
I 
run 
the 
risk 
of 
letting 
everything 
be 
defined 
by 
endings, 
which 
seems like a uniquely 
unsatisfying way to live. 
Even if the things I’m 
writing aren’t the truest 
truth — even if they are 
shaped by how I want to 
feel or think I should feel 
— the approximations I come up with are better 
than the alternative, which is my own malleable 
memory.
S

peaking of endings: I’ve been thinking 
about them a lot lately. I’m a senior, and 
the knowledge that this is my last year 
in Ann Arbor seems to crop up at inconvenient 
times. It doesn’t seem so long ago that I was a 
freshman. College is funny that way: Graduation 
doesn’t seem far off, but neither does the time 
when leaving felt impossibly remote. 
The weirdest part of being a senior for me is 
that this is when college life feels the fullest and 
settled. My bedroom feels like a real room, not a 
temporary landing pad. The drawing of a hand 
that my friend Summer made; the Andy Warhol 
poster I bought in Chicago over fall break; the 
ticket stub from a concert I covered for The 
Daily; the cartoon I cut out from The New Yorker 
last week. (Roald Dahl sits under a tree, waiting 
for a book idea. A giant technicolor peach falls 
on his head.) 
And my friends: I’ve known them for long 
enough that we have a trove of stories to tell and 
retell, a whole world that we’ve created over the 
past three years. We say, remember the time we 
ducked out of a party to get burritos? Remember 
when I spilled red wine all over a boy’s white 
shirt at that frat party and he came stomping 
into the girl’s bathroom to find me? Remember 
when we thought we heard a burglar and ran 
outside and accidently locked ourselves out of 
the house? Remember the day at the river, that 
football game in the snow? The sunburn?

Remembering college is as satisfying right 
now as it’ll ever be, because nothing hurts to 
recall. It’s all still here. But in six months it’ll 
be over, and I’m trying to figure out how to not 
keep thinking about the end. I think part of the 
solution might have to do with writing things 
down — not just for future-me, who will want 
to crawl back into this life, but also for now-me. 
Documenting the way things are right now is 
a way to indulge in the present, to feel as if it’s 
ok to stay deep inside my life, even if the pain of 
leaving might change the way I remember this 
time. 
In a series of excerpts from the late journalist 
Mavis Gallant’s diaries, which were published 
in The New Yorker in 2012, one entry from 1959 
stood out to me.
“Must reality become unreal?” she wrote. 
“Record, then, that we took the train and walked 
in the royal park at Marly, and lay in the uncut 
grass under a sky as warm as wool and blue 
as itself. The chestnut trees looked as though 
nothing could oblige them ever to shed their 
leaves; and when the wind bent the grass around 
the barren flat, submissively, the grass went all 
one color, silvery, like the underside of leaves, as 
if it might rain.”
I admire how swiftly Gallant moved from 
existential angst to earnest, keenly observant 
musings on the present. This, I think, is the 
work of all diarists — to recognize that the task 
of documentation is an impossible one, and to 
proceed with it anyway.

The 
ringing of my 
alarm 
wakes 
me 
up. 
The 
warmth 
of 
my sheets and the ache in 
my limbs and back keep me bound to 
the bed, lethargic on a day when honking cars and 
whirring buses outside my window call for me to get 
up. I remain suspended in place while businessmen 
stride along the sidewalk outside my window. Their 
odd strides unsettle me. Yet, what is most troubling 
is what lies in the sun’s illuminating gaze, what lies 
on my mind every waking hour, what lies next to me 
and is often my first sight of the day. Every morning, 
as I lean on my elbow and reach into the distance to 
silence my alarm, my eyes glance at my desk, and I 
grimace at the horror before me. No matter how hard 
I try, I cannot forget what is here with me.
On my desk sit two porcelain plates, two white 
bowls, one plastic bowl and a metal spoon, fork and 
knife, all piled up in a makeshift tower. The top plate 
is smothered with remnants of my mother’s moong 
dal, caking the white surface with a hardened crust. 
The plate seems to hold a barren desert, the blue and 
green stripes and flowers in the center of the plate 
obscured. Bits of scattered roti line the edges of the 

plastic bowl, and though the spoon 
seems clean enough to be used 
again, the stains of overuse 
remain.
When I eventually 
roll out of bed and 
turn to my to-do 
list to write the 
many 
tasks 
to 
complete, 
doing 
my 
dishes 
doesn’t end 
up 
there. 
I 
can 
read 
50 
pages in 
an 
hour 
right 
before a 
book dis-
cussion, 
review 
concepts 
right 
before 
an 
exam 
and 
write a six-
page essay all 
in one night, but 
I somehow never 
find a moment to 
wash my plates and 
utensils. I put my mom’s 
home cooked meals in the 
microwave on a dirty plate. 
Food waste continues to collect 
on the containers. “I’ll get to it when 
I have to,” I tell myself. “It’s not an issue 
right now.” Despite being aware of the grotesque aes-
thetic and potential for mold or sanitation concerns, I 
continue on with my day completely unworried, only 
doing a brief water rinse when truly necessary.
My stagnant negligence might sound familiar. The 
way in which I justify my disregard for my dirty dish-
es parallels a common narrative we hear in response 
to concerns about climate change. The politicians, 
businessmen and other public figures who are most 
able to take action to reduce the threat of climate 
change continually backpedal, essentially justifying 
inaction rather than reform. At its core, the problem 
of climate change is a problem of procrastination 
at a high-level — industrialists, policymakers and 
executives who knew that their work was a ticking 
time bomb passed it on to future generations. This 
conscious complacency comes from greed and pri-
oritizing personal desire over collective health and 
security. Procrastination easily snowballs, yet more 
reprehensible is being aware of the implications of 
procrastination and doing nothing in the name of 

short-term gain.
In many ways, my plate crisis is one I inherited 
from my family, though I do not blame my parents or 
any one person in particular for handing it off to me. 
We often leave things to be done until the last pos-
sible minute — filling out paperwork the night it is 
due, cleaning the house minutes before guests arrive 
and, of course, washing the dishes only when we need 
clean plates or silverware. We often stack individu-
al plates in the sink after a quick rinse rather than 
scrubbing them down and putting them away. Soon 
enough, a tower like the one on my desk forms in our 
kitchen. When there’s no other option, my parents 
eventually crack their knuckles and get to washing.
It’s a common tradition in Indian culture to hand 
down dishware to children after serious develop-
ments in their life, such as moving away from home 
or marriage, and these dishes oftentimes have a par-
ent or grandparent’s name inscribed on them. The 
set that I received when I came to Michigan follows 
along in this custom. 
But I ask myself, “Do I want to pass down plates and 
silverware that have been so tainted, so desecrated 
that it feels unnerving to think of someone else eat-
ing from them? Am I just destined to follow the same 
path of prior generations — the path of attrition and 
decay until the dishes fall and the problem becomes 
real enough to be addressed?”
When the food scraps on my desk spilled over one 
afternoon before a class earlier this year, I knew I 
had to change my habits. After scrubbing the food off 
the plates under the stream of water with a sponge, I 
resolved to wash every dish, even the smallest utensil, 
immediately after use. When I had a late-night snack, 
I didn’t wait till the next morning to clean it and store 
it in a drawer. Though my realization was painful, it 
has done wonders for my room, clearing up space on 
my desk and letting me tackle my day with one less 
nagging concern on my mind.
The tragedy in comparing my dishwashing process 
to an extinction-level threat is the way in which the 
metaphor falls apart. I can always shift course to cul-
tivate personal growth, but there is no such imme-
diate solution that can completely halt the current 
process of the warming climate and its many effects. 
While I can face my demons, humankind cannot face 
its own. The war of attrition is in some ways inevi-
table for reform, and efforts to combat the crisis are 
currently trying to clear the first hurdle — getting 
those to whom the issue most pertains to acknowl-
edge the issue. 
Until procrastinators and opportunists like me 
decide that it is in our best interest to solve an under-
lying issue rather than let it fester, nothing is going to 
get done. If we can’t even maintain our own personal 
plates in order, then we certainly cannot preserve our 
place on Earth.

riday, 09/14
I was in a canoe swaying down 
a narrow river, barely fitting the 
width of it. A cat with orange hair and white 
patches was following me along the riverbank. 
She was a chunky cat with an extra layer of fat 
all around and a face a bit too scrunched up. I 
was approaching the entrance of a cave that 
appeared to stretch as high as the bright blue 
sky. The cave’s inner walls gave off a subtle, 
purple hue all around, stretching from the 
bottom of the river up along the cave’s walls. 
Cautiously, my hands trembling on the side 
of the canoe, I glanced down at the water to 
see how my reflection had turned purple, 
but the water was too wavy for me to see my 
face clearly. My thin face was a large, purple 
swirl with my right eye and bottom lip almost 
touching. 
The cat now crawled on the walls beside 
me, avoiding my canoe with determination. 
I called out what was apparently her name, 
“Luna …” But Luna paid me no mind. My 
shout echoed through the endless cave, but 
instead of fading away it grew twice as loud 
as if someone at the end of the cave was shout-
ing back.
I 

was at the theater sitting next to my 
childhood friend, Hannah. We were 
both eight when we were friends. She 
kept talking too loudly over the play that was 
going on, telling jokes and trying to make me 
laugh. We were seated in the middle of the 
seventh row, and I felt as if everyone could 
hear us. I felt an odd sensation behind me, and 
when I turned to look, I saw an arm reaching 
out with desperation to touch my shoulder. 
Screaming, I looked up to see who it was, but 
their face was a blur — completely unrecog-
nizable as if I was looking through a smudged 
camera. As I stared, trying to distinguish 
who it was, I grew to the size of my current, 
18-year-old self while Hannah tugged at my 
hair, trying to bring me lower. She lifted up 
my pink dress, gasping at the sight of my fully-
grown, bare legs. As I was trying to push my 
dress back down, Hannah stood up so that she 
was at eye-level and shouted with contempt, 
“Why are there cat scratches all over you?” 
Suddenly, I felt pain in my thighs and looked 
down. Blood was dripping from them, sliding 
down my legs to the theater floor toward the 
stage. Hannah ran away, screaming, my blood 
stained on her yellow floral dress. 
U

sually I can’t remember my 
dreams, but these dreams — 
they’re vivid. Before, my dreams 
would just be day-to-day occurrences, so 
much so that I’d forget what was a dream 
and what had actually happened. I dreamt 
of things like asking my roommate for a pen-
cil, being late for class, getting locked out of 

my dorm. Then the day after these kinds of 
dreams, I’d see something that reminded 
me of the dream, like a dull pencil, and only 
then I’d remember it had been a dream. 
These recent dreams, however, are dif-
ferent — unquestionably separate from real-
ity. They’re stuck in my brain all day. I’ll be 
sitting in my first year philosophy lecture, 
tuning out my professor, and just imagining 
my blood running down to the front of the 
lecture hall and soaking through his brown, 
leather dress shoes. These dreams frighten 
me. They awaken a part of my life that I’ve 
disconnected from: my childhood, my inno-
cence. Both feel so far away from me now. 
These feelings started when Abby, my 
roommate, wanted to go to a party. This was 
last night. She ran out of friends to go with, 
I guess, so she had made me go with her. It 
was my first college party. Oh, you wouldn’t 
believe how excited I was — awkward danc-
ing, beer-soaked men, I couldn’t wait. Abby 
dressed me in one of her black crop tops 
and jean-shorts, overdid my make-up and 
straightened my long blonde hair. I remem-
ber how heavy my eyes felt from the mascara 
on my lashes. It felt odd seeing myself in the 

mirror, but Abby had managed to make my 
blue eyes glow. We had both gotten dressed 
in the small space between our beds, bump-
ing into each other occasionally. She had 
plenty of clothes to pick from. They poured 
out of her dressers and unpacked boxes all 
alongside her piles of shoes that drifted over 
to my relatively cleaner side.
 I don’t know why she had wanted to go 
so badly. It was one of those grimy parties 
with over-eager guys everywhere. I just 
made sure I drank enough so I wouldn’t feel 
so badly when random boys started danc-
ing on me. That’s how the night started at 
least. Soon, I’d drunk so much bubbly, green 
jungle juice, that my spinning head sped into 
a blur along with my memories of the night. 
There were hands on my waist, whispers in 
my ear and sloppy kisses down my neck. It 
felt so new, so warm, so I followed where it 
took me. I don’t remember what happened 
next. All I know is I woke up in my dorm 
with a boy in my bed. He was passed out, 
drooling on my pillow, his black, shaggy 
hair covering his eyes. I wasn’t sure what I’d 
done with him until Abby had started mak-
ing fun of me for losing my virginity during 

the first week of college. 
The only thing I’ve been able to do today 
is write this entry and take some show-
ers. I took seven showers today. I wanted 
everyone’s sweat from the party off of me. 
I wanted his musty smell off me. I wanted 
the shame off me. My rose body wash would 
lather on my arms, legs, chest, stomach, so 
much so that I couldn’t see my own skin 
anymore, and for a moment, I felt clean of 
everything. Then after too short a time the 
water would wash it all away, and the sight 
of my own, defiled skin would leave me rest-
less. I repeated this process throughout the 
day, scrubbing with more force each time. 
When I wake up and recount my dreams, 
I reflect on my childhood, and the shame I 
felt after waking up with the boy resurface. 
The guilt I feel for disappointing my past 
self, it’s something I have to spend the whole 
day recovering from; my brain is heavy, my 
heart is stinging, my throat is closed. That’s 
why I’m writing all my dreams down in this 
journal and reflecting on them. I thought 
maybe it’d help them escape my brain.
