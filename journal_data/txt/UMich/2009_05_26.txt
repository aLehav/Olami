MARIJUANA CLASS
Seminar
on drugs
a success
Oaksterdam offers
classes on laws and
usage of marijuana
By ERIC CHIU
For the Daily
Last weekend at an event
sponsored by California-based
Oaksterdam University, more
than 300 people packed the Best
Western Executive Plaza in Ann
Arbor, for the first marijuana ed-
ucational seminar held in Michi-
gan-since the passage of Proposal
1 last November.
During the seminar, audience
members asked many questions,
demonstrating a general lack of
knowledge about the issues sur-
rounding marijuana usage. Oak-
sterdam University Executive
Chancellor Dale Clare attributed
the lack of knowledge to the cur-
rent state of marijuana educa-
tion.
"It's not just a lack of infor-
mation (about marijuana), but an
amount of disinformation and'a
misunderstanding, or misrepre-
sentation, of some information
and just a total vacuum in some
places," Clare said.

Google Book Search
will solve the hassle
of hunting for books
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
A contract between Google and
the University will soon allow stu-
dents to browse through Universi-
ty library stacks from the comfort
of their own homes.
Paul Courant, a University eco-
nomics professor and dean of li-
braries, signed an agreement last
Wednesday with Google Book
Search that will give Google access
to scan and digitized nearly 6 mil-
lion of the University's books. In

return, the University will receive
a cost-subsidized subscription to
the entire online book database
- both from the University's col-
lection and other contributing li-
braries.
"We think that the future of
library scholarship includes the
ability to access a digitized li-
brary," Courant said.
Rather than searching through
shelves to find a particular book,
students will be able to find the
entire book on their computers.
Courant said the advantage of
this access is that students will
be able to find and read the Uni-
versity's "hidden books," the ones
filed away in library stacks that are
difficult to access.
Last year, the Authors Guild and

the Association of Ataerican Pub-
lishers sued Google for scanning
books without getting permission
from the copyright owners. The
University decided to try the new
systemafterGooglereachedasettle-
ment with the two groups regarding
ownership rights to the texts.
The University's agreement
with Google calls for libraries and
universities to pay a subscription
to Google Book Search, which will
allow students to read full texts
from their desktops.
Overall, the new system will in-
crease the accessibility of books,
which Courant said was a key
factor in his decision to sign the
agreement.

university's Oakland campus were
initially small, but media attention
caused an increase in enrollment,
and the school opened a second
campus in Los Angeles, Calif.
Both campuses are currently
holding classes for about 160 stu-
dents each week..
Clare said Michigan first caught
Oaksterdam's attention after Pro-
posal 1 - which legalized medici-
nal marijuana in-the state - passed
last November. OU chose to hold its
classes in Ann Arbor due to the city's
lax marijuana laws, Clare said.
"In reading Michigan's law, we
recognized that for the first time in
a long time there was another state
that had legislation that was similar
to our own," he said.
Clare added that Oaksterdam was
interested in helping Michigan im-
plement the proposal.
"(We realized) there's other peo-
ple out there that have an opportu-
nity to really make or break this new
law, and we have a chance to get out
there and teach them how to do it
well," Clare said.
Clare said that beginning in Janu-
ary, Oaksterdam started reaching

for Google Book Search, said one of
Google's main missions is to "orga-
nize all of the world's information:'
Google Book Search, which
Google initiated six years ago, gives
students in participating schools
and libraries access to resources
that they could not otherwise ob-
tain online.
"A large amount of (information)
is in books, journals and magazines,
which are a record of the scholarly
historical nast and are not available

out to various marijuana advocacy
groups in viichigan. Those connec-
tions eventually ledto lastweekend's
seminar.
Clare added thathe was surprised
by the response of those interested
in attending the seminar. The first
week after it was announced,-Oak-
sterdam received more than 600
calls from people inquiring about
the seminar and wanting to regis-
ter.
Ohio resident Rosie Hess said she
was motivated to attend the seminar
because she and her husband have
health issues that qualify them to
grow medicinal marijuana.
"I need to learn to grow the best,
of course, butalso go ahead and make
a living doing it," Hess said. "This is
something I firmly believe in and
something that I think the nation is
eventually going to be gravitating to,
so I'd like to do my part."
LSA junior Francesca Bardinelli,
an executive director for Students
for Sensible Drug Policy, said she
supported the seminar for similar
reasons.
"Everyone has the right to seek
the medical attention that they need,
even if that is marijuana, which is il-
legal," Bardinelli said. "I mean, these
people are in pain and n.eed help.
Why should they be denied the only
online yet," Clancy said.
Right now public access is limited
by the physical book; (Google Book
Search) greatly opens us access to
books."
The system will permit University
students, staff, faculty, and partici-
pating libraries around the country
to receive digital access to millions
of complete books. Individuals will
also have the ability to buy books
online if the books are not affiliated
with a university or library. Accord-
ing to Clancy, individual books will
cost $14.99 or less.
Contributing libraries like the

Clancy said Google Books offers a
full search of the database, but read-
ers can only see 3 million of the 10

of those 3 million, only a preview of
up to 20 percent of the book is avail-

Clancy added that with Google

LSA senior Morgan Baker snoke

voiced her concern about authors'

the only issue there is getting au-

their work should be in a library, or
whether or not we should be paying

I think that (the University) is all

Though it will be an ongoing pro-

students will reap the benefits of the

Veterans start anew at 'U'

More programs ease
transition from army
life to student life
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
For student veterans at the Uni-
versity, the transition to college
life is different from what many
freshmen or transfer students
experience.
Coming out of active duty in the
military and into a university set-
ting involves a whole different set
of unknowns - including being
older than other students and cop-
ing with feelings of isolation.
LSA junior John Farrow, an Air
Force veteran, said the age differ-
ence between him and other stu-
dents made it difficult to relate to
people in his graduating class.
"I'm 26 right now, and being in
a class with 18- and 19-year-olds is
kind of a hard transition, especially
with my background or any veter-
an's because you don't really relate
to the students," Farrow said.

LSA senior Douglas Prough
decided to join the National Guard
after high school in order to pay
for college. His service took him to
Germany and the Republic of Kos-
ovo where he worked with flight
operations and air traffic control.
Upon Prough's arrival at the
University in 2006, which he
called "a huge transition," avail-
able services to veterans were
almost nonexistent. Prough added
that with the lacking veteran sup-
port systems it was difficult to
meet people.
But the University has been
making strides to encourage stu-
dent veterans to feel more com-
fortable on campus by providing
them with more coping services
than in previous years.
When LSA senior Derek Blumke,
an Air Force veteran, transferred
to the University in 2007, he found
that services for veterans were
basically nonexistent. In the spring
of thatyear, Blumke took the initia-
tive to form the Student Veterans
Association - a group that would
help University student veterans
become accustomed to college life.

During the same time, Blumke
was involved in founding Student
Veterans of America - a group
that now has 180 chapters across
the country at many college cam-
puses.
Blumke said the issues student
veterans face range from feeling
isolated to receiving questions
from other students that can make
veterans feel uneasy. He added
that the main goal of the Student
Veterans Association is to encour-
age veterans to go to college and be
successful.
Since the organization's incep-
tion, Blumke has flown back and
forth to Washington, D.C. in a
tireless effort to lobby on behalf of
student veterans. He has also been
working on a project concerning
mental health and suicide preven-
tion for veterans.
According to Blumke, the num-
ber of veteran suicides is at the
highest it has been in the last 20
years.
With Blumke and other student
veterans pushing for reforms, the
University is making an effort to
implement more programs for vet-

erans. Last fall, the office of New
Student Programs created the Stu-
dent Veterans Assistance Program
to provide more services for stu-
dent veterans and those currently
involved in the military, like men-
toring programs, an orientation
program designed specifically for
veterans and mental health pro-
grams.
Philip Larson, head of the Stu-
dent Veterans Assistance Pro-
gram, wrote in an e-mail interview
that the program exists to support
veterans and active service mem-
bers.
"We understand that former and
current military service members
have unique needs and qualities
that they bring to the University,"
Larson wrote. "These qualities
include maturity, leadership skills,
determination, commitment and
a deeper understanding of the
world."
Blumke said he believes the
resource office will help veterans
transition to college life - includ-
ing its 65 current veterans - and
will help the University recruit
other veterans.

AALAA ALBAROUDI IEP7I:
Veiled discrimination

Armed and dangerous
Texas bill to allow guns on campuses is unnecessarily extreme
exas has a reputation for being home to some gun-slinging cOw-
boys. But a bill recently passed by the Texas State Senate may turn
Texas college students into gunslingers, too. The bill would allow
concealed firearms on all public properties - including college campuses.
But the Texas House of Representatives, which has not yet considered
the bill, must realize its dangerous implications. The bill fails to recog-
nize that colleges and universities are places of learning that should foster
an environment of enlightenment, not fear. The Texas House must defeat
this bill or risk encouraging a dangerous trend that disturbs college cam-
puses and infringes on universities' autonomy.

Religious discrimination in the
courtroom is very dishearten-
ing to many people of faith. One
recent example here in Michi-
gan is that of Ginnah Muham-
mad, a Muslim woman whose
small claims court case in near-
by Hamtramck was dismissed
because she refused to remove her
veil while testifying. The judge's
refusal to hear Muhammad's case
violated her freedom of religion
and demonstrated the discrimi-
nation Muslims frequently face in
the courtroom - a discrimination
that needs to end.
Muhammad wears the niqab -
aveilthat covers her face fromthe
nose down - in daily life as part of
her religious practice. The judge
presiding over the suit, District
Judge Paul Paruk, stated that he
needed to see Muhammad's face
while she was testifying to be able
to see whether she was telling the
truth. When she refused, Paruk
dismissed her case.
In response to the dismissal,
Muhammad sued Paruk in fed-
eral court, alleging a violation of
her First Amendment right to free
exercise of religion. The federal
court dismissed the case, stating
that the state courts should han-
dle the issue. Based on this rul-
ing, Michigan's Supreme Court
proposed allowing state judges
leeway on the issue of dress in the
courtroom.Ithas delayed avote on
the change until its next adminis-
trative conference on June 17.
In two past United States
Supreme Court case decisions,
Sherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin
v. Yoder, the court decided that
there mustbe a"compellinginter-
est" to override people's right to
practice their religion. In the first
case, the Supreme Court held that
there was no compelling state
interest that justified the with-
holding of unemployment com-
pensation to a woman who was
fired from her job for refusing
to work on Saturday on religious
grounds. In the latter case, Amish
parents refused to send their chil-
dren to public school after the age
of 16. The Supreme Court unani-
mously held that the free exercise
of religion outweighed the state's
interest in compelling school

attendance.
Muhammad's case is no dif-
ferent. There wasn't a compel-
ling state interest in Muhammad
taking off her veil. Paruk did
not even show consideration to
other options that would be less
burdensome, such as permitting
Muhammad to appear before a
female judge, for whom she would
be able to remove her veil.
Paruk blew this case complete-
ly out of proportion. One would
assume that the most important
factor in a case is the testimony
given and the facts presented, not
the demeanor of a testifier's face.
This kind of evidence is subjec-
tive, and Paruk probably could
not have determined Muham-
mad's honesty just by seeing her
face. Besides, Muhammad's eyes
- usually considered the most
expressive part of the face - were
already showing. The benefit that
Paruk could have gotten from
judging the demeanor of Muham-
mad's mouth and nose could not
have been enough of a compelling
state interestto justify overriding
her right to free religious exer-
cise.
On a more dismaying note,
Paruk seemed dismissive of
Muhammad's religious beliefs
as a Muslim, informing her that
her decision to not remove the
veil wasn't a "religious thing"
but a "cultural thing." For Paruk
to downplay her religious beliefs
and amount them to a simple cul-
tural choice is an insult to Muslim
women everywhere who choose
to wear the nigab as part of their
Islamic religion.
This is one of many instances
in which Muslims have faced
religious discrimination. The
appearance of Muslims in reli-
gious clothing has been used to
push the idea that Muslims aren't
real Americans. Steps need to be
taken to ensure equal treatment
of people of all religions, espe-
cially in the courtroom. Religious
discrimination does exist, but the
courts should be a place where
this discrimination is ended,rnot
abetted.

The Texas Senate passed the
bill on Wednesday by a vote of
19-12. The proposed law would
allow concealed handguns on all
public property, even elementary
and high schools. Private insti-
tutions would be exempt. The
bill does not change laws that
restrict concealed carry permits
to those over 21 who have passed
criminal background checks and
other training requirements.
Half of the members of the
House of Representatives have
already committed to support-
ing the bill. If it passes, Texas
will join West Virginia, Colora-
do and Utah in allowing guns on
public university campuses. But
unlike these states, the Texas
law will not let individual uni-
versities decide whether or not
to allow guns on campus.
This bill challenges univer-
sities' educational autonomy,
which is essentialto maintaining
institutions of higher learning.

Under the bill, public universi-
ties in Texas - even those that
currently prohibit firearms on
campus - would be forced to
allow concealed weapons. Each
campus is different, and each
university should have the abil-
ity to determine what is best for
its students. For the state to con-
tradict its universities' decisions
regarding the safety of their stu-
dents is naive and irresponsibly
heavy-handed.
The fear of being undefended
in the event of a school shooting
may have led more colleges and
states to consider allowing guns
on campus. But allowing guns on
campuses isn'tthe way to assuage
this fear. Guns are an unneces-
sarily dangerous solution and
better alternatives to keep stu-
dents safe exist. Instead of arm-
ingstudents and deputizing them
to participate in a Wild West-
style shootout, it's important for
universities to focus on prevent-

ing these attacks from happen-
ing in the first place. Improving
access to mental health care for
students is one way of doing this.
States, meanwhile, should main-
tain sensible restrictions and
proper screening procedures to
obtain a concealed carry weapon
permit, ensuring that those who
should not have access to a fire-
arm ever get it.
Improved response plans
can also eliminate the per-
ceived need for firearms. Proper
lockdown procedures and an
informed faculty and staff can
make a big difference in ensur-
ing that campuses are safe, and
so can emergency alert proce-
dures like text-messaging and
e-mail alert systems.
The Texas House must defeat
this bill and focus its attention on
making campuses safer. There is
no question that students must
be protected, but adding more
guns is not the answer.

BELLA SHAH

The Obama administration's
search for the next Supreme
Court Justice is under way.
Justice David
Souter's retire- ,
ment announce-
ment earlier g
this month has
opened up a seat
on the bench.
The Associated -
Press seems con- CHRIS
vinced that a face KOSLOWSI
familiar to most
Michiganders -
Governor Jennifer Granholm - is
on the President's short listcofonomi-
nees. It's easy to see why. Granhom
is young, recognizable, female and
reliably liberal. But despite her
appeal to President Barack Obama,
Granholm's nomination would set
a devastating standard that could
threaten the federal government's
system of checks and balances.
Let's get one undeniable fact out
of the way first. Despite Obama's
repeated campaign promises to
govern moderately, he's already
taken huge steps to expand the
government's influence with little
regard for his opposition's opinion.
Assuming the likely scenario that
Norm Coleman loses his appeal of
Al Franken's victory in last Novem-
ber's disputed Minnesota Senate
race, the Democrats will control 60
Senate seats. This supermajority
will block any Republican filibus-
ter against Obama's nominee. This
is Obama's golden opportunity to
nominate a justice that will fill the
shoes of the consistently liberal
Souter with little opposition.
One might think an absolute-
ly necessary requirement for a
Supreme Court justice would be
experience as a judge. Granholm
has none. She was elected Michi-
gan's attorney general in 1998 and
governor in 2002. In fact, her quali-
fications are frightfully similar to
one of Obama's admitted heroes -
Earl Warren. The Supreme Court
chief justice - who was also a for-
mer attorney general and governor
at the time of his nomination - pre-
sided over rulings that extended the
court's influence. Granted, Warren
Court rulings like Brown v. Board
of Education instigated needed
change in American law, but the
precedent set by Warren pushed the
once traditional court into a battle
between the philosophies of judicial
activism and judicial restraint that
still rages.
But there is a major difference
between Warren and Granholm.
During his political career, War-
ren earned universal support from

across the party spectrum. In the
1946 California gubernatorial elec-
tion, Warren won the Republican,
Democratic and Progressive Party
primaries. Granholm, on the other
hand, has participated in three divi-
sive elections in which her political
biases were on full display. If nomi-
nated, Granholm could be the most
politically charged justice in over50
years, and the first inthis new era of
power for the Supreme Court.
A nomination of such a political
figure would cause more damage
than any other nominee on Obama's
short list. For example, Diane Wood,
a U.S. Court of Appeals judge from
Chicago. leans to the left and is a
favorite to receive Obama's nomi-
nation. Her rulings might be just as
liberal as Granholm's would be, but
at least her appointment wouldn't
jeopardize the Court's credibility.
Gov. Granholm
is too partisan
to be a justice.
The appointment of career poli-
ticians like Granholm to the Court
would undermine its separation
from the executive and legislative
branches. There is a reason why
justices are traditionally non-polit-
ical figures and are given lifetime
terms. The Supreme Court is sup-
posed to transcend politics in order
to correctly apply our laws without
bias. The nomination of a blatantly
political justice would only increase
these problems and is the last thing
the court needs, especially when
the court wields so much power and
is more politicized than ever.
Despite the ease with which her
confirmation could pass the Senate,
Granholm would be one of the least
qualified and most politicized jus-
tices in the last 100 years. Residing in
a judicial body which is supposed to
interpretthelawinapoliticallyunbi-
ased way, Granholm would be exact-
lythe kind ofvoicethattheFounding
Fathers were trying to keep out of
the nation's highest court.
There's hope that Obama is smart*
enough to realize he doesn't need
to corrupt the Supreme Court with
party politics in order to nominate
a justice that will reliably walk the
liberal line. But with a potential
nominee as politically attractive as
Granholm, I'm hesitant to believe
he'll be able resist her appeal.

T he idea of "campaign
promises" is self-explan-
atory. Once elected to
office, candi-
dates are sup-
posed to follow
through on the
pledges they
made while
on the cam-
paign trail. But
by bungling ED
the closing of MCPHEE
Guantanamo
Bay prison and
failing to scrap the Military Com-
missions Act, President Barack
Obama is not fulfilling those
promises.
His campaign promise was that
he would reject the Military Com-
missions Act - the legislation
that has made prisons like Gitmo
a threat to constitutional rights.
He instead revised its interpreta-
tion, while still allowing confes-
sions coerced through torture as
legal evidence in court and sus-
pending habeas corpus rights -
allowing enemy combatants now
classified as "prisoners of war" to
be detained indefinitely without
charges filed against them.
Though the United States
Supreme Court ruled that the
enemy combatants held at Gitmo
have a right to challenge their
imprisonment in 2008, Obama
said in a speech at the National
Archives on Thursday that "if and
when we determine that the Unit-
ed States must hold individuals to
keep them from carrying out an
act of war, we will do so within
a system that involves judicial
and congressional oversight."
Through this statement, Obama
admitted that if his administra-
tion decides that any of those held
at Gitmo could carry out an act of
war, he will be held indefinitely
with judicial and congressional

oversight, not permission.
Closing Gitmo without end-
ing actions like these is an empty
victory for freedom. Obama is
trying to play America for a fool.
He's panderingto those who were
vehemently opposed to President
George Bush's civil right viola-
tions without actually changing
the policy. The point of closing
Gitmo was to put an end to the
Military Commissions Act. The
end of Gitmo was supposed to be a
victory for freedom-lovers every-
where, but every minute the Mili-
tary Commissions Act endures, it
becomes more of a defeat. Obama.
campaigned under messages of
hope and change, yet he's con-
tinuing the behavior that made so
many citizens angry about losing
their constitutional rights.
Unfortunately, politicians
are ignoring this facet of closing
Gitmo. As it stands right now,
the biggest political outcry is
Obama's lack of a plan for the cur-
rent detainees. Their concern is
that closing the facility is a dan-
gerous but necessary solution to
the U.S.'s detainee problems.
But closing the facility is nei-
ther dangerous nor a solution
to these problems. Transferring
the detainees to other prisons
doesn't stop the constitutional
rights abuse, it merely continues
the government's denial that it is
acting unethically. And moving
detainees to new prisons, possi-
bly inside the U.S., doesn't make
the nation any less safe. As long
as detainees aren't released, they
don't pose a great risk to the pub-
lic. As Obama himself pointed out
in his speech Thursday, "Nobody
has ever escaped from one of our
'supermax' prisons, which hold
hundreds of convicted terrorists."
With this ongoing debate, poli-
ticians - and the general public
- continue to be distracted from

the fact that Obama continues to
hold suspected terrorists with-
out charging them with an actual
crime. What is at great risk here
is the continued abuse of con-
stitutional rights. Habeas cor-
pus rights are guaranteed by the
United States constitution for a
reason. Their denial is unethical,
inhumane and in direct contra-
diction to the rule of law that we
value in the U.S.
Habeas corpus
shouldn't only
be for citizens.
It's funny that in Obama's
speech he stood adjacent to the
Constitution. He called it "the
foundation of liberty and justice
in this country, and a light that
shines for all who seek freedom,
fairness, equality and dignity in
the world." That's ironic, consid-
ering the Military Commissions
Act has angered several European
nations, and many liberty-based
activistgroups such as the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union.
I'm not naive enough to think
that all of the detainees at Gitmo
are innocent just because they
haven't been charged. This is a
dangerous time, but that's what
makes it more important than
ever to protect basic constitutioi-
al rights. Obama needs to either
end this mess or stop masquerad-
ing as a protector of the American
people. When Gitmo closes, he
should end the Military Commis-
sions Act. Doing so could restore
the nation's faith in him as an
actual change from Bush.

'U' professors unveil alleged 'missing link'

Ancient fossil offers
alternative view of
human origins
By LARA ZADE
Managing News Editor
Two University professors were
part of an anthropological dream
team that recently unveiled a
47-million-year-old primate fossil
that sheds new light on the origins
of humans.
Philip Gingerich, director of the
University's Museum of Paleontol-
ogy and B. Holly Smith, associate
research scientist of the Univer-
sity's Museum of Anthropology,
contributed to the study of a new
primate species, Darwinius masil-
lae - dubbed Ida for short. Ida
represents an arboreal quadruped

that roamed the forests of Messel,
Germany nearly 50 million years
ago.
The fossil is gaining attention
because it's one of the most com-
plete primate fossils ever recovered
and represents an ancient primate
group that researchers now believe
monkeys and apes - and, subse-
quently, humans later on - evolved
from.
"It was a real privilege to study,
because I do have to say, I've never
seen a fossil that has so much
information out of it," Smith said.
Smith added that the fossil was
so well preserved that its stomach
contents were still intact.
Ida, is believed to have been a
weaned, juvenile female who died
before one year of age. She is a
member of the adapoid primates, a
group that was formerly thought to
have contributed solely to modern-

day lemurs and set aside from the
lineage of monkeys and apes.
But, Gingerich, Smith and the
fourotherresearcherswhostudied
the fossil concluded based on cer-
tain morphological characteristics
more similar to monkeys and apes
than to lemurs that the adapoid
group cannot be dismissed as an
outlier in human evolution.
"This animal has front teeth
incisors like ours, like monkeys
and apes and humans do," Gin-
gerich said. "It doesn't have point-
ed incisors like tarisers and not
combed incisors like lemurs. It
also has toes, and if it's a lemur it
should have a grooming claw, but
it doesn't."
According to Gingerich, Ida was
found 20 to 25 years ago when an
amateur fossil hunter in Messel,
Germany, walked through a rock
pile and found a slab of rock and
split it in half. One half exhibited
an intact half of the fossil, while
the other half suffered from
numerous fractures, which its

discoverer tried to hide. ing public relations contribu-
The private collector then sold tions by fellow researcher Jorn H.

During the adolescences of today's col-
lege students, Eminem was a mainstay
in the world of popular
music. His early antics
as Slim Shady drew heat
from nearly every human
rights association in the
United States. At the same Relapse
time, the lewd nature of Aftermath/
his early releases - along Interscope
with his arrogance and
overall shock value -
made him an idol and a millionaire over-
night.
After three massively successful albums
and one of the more spectacular rags-to-
riches stories in recent musical memory,
the Detroit-based emcee settled down com-
fortably in 2005 as a behind-the-scenes,
Diddy-esque hip-hop mogul extremely con-

tent with his past accom- .
plishments and excited
for a future filled with all
of the accolades normally
reserved for rap royalty
From anoutsider's per-
spective, this would seem
to be a heavenly retire-
ment - one in which
Eminem would be able
to distance himself from
the day-to-day grind of a Staring contest. Go
contracted recording art-
ist and, in essence, settle down. But as we
all know, the antics of one Marshall Mathers
are far from predictable. Even though it's
due time for Eminem's resurgence, attempt-
ed comebacks, especially for musicians, are
always extremely trying endeavors.
With Relapse, Eminem has illuminated
what makes that second try so difficult.
On the album, we hear Eminem travel-
ing back in time to find his musical roots.
Instead of evolving as an artist, Eminem
just gathers the elements of what catapulted
him to superstardom in the first place. He
employs hip-hop mastermind and elder
statesman Dr. Dre to craft the beats and
revisits old lyrical muses such as his moth-

er, his drug-addled past and his passion for
insulting other celebrities; essentially, he is
writing music to fit the preexisting Em ste-
reotypes.
Try as he might, the songs just don't come
across as sincere. They seem more like a con-
trived attempt to coalesce with today's Top
40 music. His first single "Crack a Bottle" is
a number-one hit that runs off of the notori-
ety of co-contributors Dr. Dre and 50 Cent.
Eminem even dares to delve into the murky
waters of Autotune on "Bagpipes From
Baghdad."
At the same time, he returns to his shock-
and-awe roots on the berating ballad "My
Mom" but fails mainly because he is now 36

years old and the type of humor that made
him famous now sounds forced and out of
place. He has matured - just as most artists
do - but now longs for the guise of imma-
turity.
The album's silver lining is its production.
Dr. Dre is masterful as he lays the immacu-
late groundwork for what turns out to be
Eminem's annoying flow. Dre can concoct
the perfect beat for any rhythmic situation
with the fervor of someone who has recently
hit their creative peak, even though he has
been producing for over 25 years.
The production is stellar, but in the end,
Em's unrealized desire to recreate his past
leaves us longing for the Slim Shady of old.

FILM INTERVIEW
Wayans' World

I

By DAVID RIVA
ManagingArts Editor
Breakdancing babies and ballet-
induced deaths can only mean one
thing - the Wayans family is at it
again. Known for their outrageous
and offensive humor, the Wayans
have satirized everything from
"The Exorcist" to midgets. With
their latest movie "Dance Flick,"
they look toward the dance film
genre, mashing older standards
like "Footloose" and "Dirty Danc-
ing" with the latest wave of hip-
hop influenced hits including "Step
Up" and "You Got Served."
In a recent phone interview,
Shawn Wayans ("White Chicks")
explained that the reason for mak-
ing the film now wasn't based sole-
ly on the recent success of dance
films.
"You're not hanging every last
scene on (those) movie(s) and it's
really just an excuse for you to
have a good time with a particular
genre of film.... The parodies that

don't do it that great try to be too
topical," he said.
Shawn Wayans helped write
the textbook for the modern
spoof movie with "Scary Movie"
and "Scary Movie 2." These films
parodied the horror genre and
led to many imitators including
"Not Another Teen Movie," "Date
Movie" and "Epic Movie," all sim-
ilarly playing on the stereotypes
and conventions of their chosen
genre.
There's not much respect given
to the original movies that are
spoofed, but "Whatever movie
you're making fun of, you have to
love," explained Shawn. "You also
have to know what's funny about
them. ... You handle it with class,
that's all."
One such scene in "Dance Flick"
shows Megan (newcomer Sho-
shana Bush) and Thomas (Damon
Wayans Jr., TV's "My Wife and
Kids"), both aspiring dancers, dis-
cussing Megan's dream of attend-

'Veckatimest' roars

March, almost three months prior
to its official release date, principal
songwriter Ed Droste expressed
his discontent not with the failure
to keep the album under wraps,
but with the poor audio quality of
the leaked copy. Considering the
murky state of the industry, it's
refreshing that record sales are
not the primary concern. Droste's
concern with the (internet) pub-
lic's initial impression of the new
album sums the situation up pretty
well: If it's going to leak, it damn
well better sound good.
Bitrates and audiophilic gripes
aside, Veckatimest does sound
good. Really good. Upon the
album's leak, Robin Pecknold of
Fleet Foxes went so far as to con-
gratulate Droste and the band (via
Twitter) for making "the album of
the decade." While this fawning
compliment might be an exag-
geration, Veckatimest is definitely
the strongest collection from the
Brooklyn quartet yet, offering
twelve shimmering and decep-
tively complex tracks that show-
case a band in full collaborative
swing.

WORLD SERIES BOUND
Wolverines punch their ticket to Oklahoma City

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
A three-year hiatus was long
enough for coach Carol Hutchins
and the Michigan softball team.
Since 2005 when they became the
University's only team national
champions since the 2001 field
hockey team, the Wolverines have
watched
each of MICHIGAN 8
their BAYLOR 1
seasons
end one MICHIGAN 7
round too BAYLOR 1
early. .
This year, Michigan gets to go
back where it belongs.
The fifth-seeded Wolverines
beat Baylor 8-1 and 7-1in the Super
Regional, best two-out-of-three
series to get back to the Women's
College World Series - their first
since the 2005 National Champion-
ship season.
"It's why they come to Michi-
gan," Hutchins said. "When they
come here at some point they real-
ize they're the ones that get it done.
What this group has accomplished
here, they did that. Michigan didn't
do it and I didn't do it, but the kids
do it."
For the past four years, senior
shortstop Teddi Ewing has taken
her spot on the field with the 2005
National Champions sign bear-
ing down on her. While the faces
around her have changed, she was

a stalwart for Michigan over the
past four years. But she hadn't bro-
ken through the Super Regional
barrier.
Ewing's trip to Oklahoma City
this season means that every player
who has come through the Michi-
gan softball program since 1992
will have reached at least one Col-
lege World Series.
Despite having a sub-par year at
the plate, hitting .185 on the sea-
son, Ewing went 2-for-4 against
the Bears (40-22) and scored two
runs in her final game at Alumni
Field. Both of her hits were the first
hits in rallies that scored four runs
and then three runs in the follow-
ing inning.
"We really bought in to playing
one-pitch softball and believing in
each other and believing in the pro-
gram," Ewing said. "It means a lot
to get back to Oklahoma City and
have a chance to go for it again."
While game two was highlight-
ed by Ewing's performance, it was
all about sophomore first baseman
Dorian Shaw in game one.
Shaw tied a Michigan single-
game record when she registered
three home runs. With the Wolver-
ines already up 1-0, she took Baylor
starter Whitney Canion deep in
the second inning. In the fifth, she
homered off Brittney Turner, and
an inning later it was Shaina Brock
who had the honor of giving up the
record-tying long ball. .
"We see her do it every day in

The Michigan softball team celebrates at Alumni Field following its 7-1 victory over Baylor on Saturday.

practice," junior Nikki Nemitz said.
"It's a great energy (boost) seeing
the ball go that far in a game and
counting, as opposed to in practice.
We feed off of that."
The offense had its ups and
downs this year, but its pitching
has been consistent and didn't dis-
appoint in the Super Regionals.
Nemitz and sophomore Jordan
Taylor combined to give up only
eight hits while striking out 21hit-
ters in their two games.
Taylor struck out 13 in the
series-clinching game, making it
her sixth consecutive start with
double-digit strikeouts.
"Those are two very good pitch-
ers," Baylor coach Glenn Moore

said. "They complement-each other
very well, two different styles.
(Taylor's) off-speed is devastating,
she has a late break on the ball and
it's very hard to stay on it."
The Wolverines will need their
pitchers to outduel the No. 4 seed
Alabama in their first game of the
WCWS Thursday. The Crimson

Tide's Kelsi Dunne went through
both games of the Super Regional
without having a single hit regis-
tered against her.
"I don't concern myself a whole
lot with who we're playing because
our focus is on us," Hutchins said.
"Our strength is us, and we focus
on us."

'M'prepares
for Alabama
E Uy t

Sophomore Dorian Shaw will look to spar
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
has told her team time and time
again to play one-pitch softball
- not to look ahead or look at the
past, just to focus on the next pitch
thrown.
Those single pitches will mean a
lot more as the fifth-seeded Wolver-
ines head to Oklahoma City to take
on Alabama in the first round of the
Women's College World Series.
The Crimson Tide is the No. 4
seed and, like Michigan, swept
through their Regional and Super
Regional matchups. All time, the
Wolverines hold a 4-3 record over
Alabama, but Michigan lost 3-2 in
their last meeting in 2006.
If Michigan wants to advance
past Alabama it will have to do
three things:
Get production out of the bot-
tom of the order: They just need
to get a hit - any hit. Alabama's
ace sophomore Kelsi Dunne, didn't
allow a hit in either of the Crimson
Tide's 9-0 victories over Jackson-
ville State in the Super Regionals.
After they grab that hit, the Wol-
verines will need the bottom of the
order to step up. The 7-8-9 hitters
(Dorian Shaw, Stephanie Kirkpat-
rick, and Teddi Ewing, respective-
ly) got the offense started in both
of Michigan's Super Regional wins
last weekend.
Shaw, a sophomore first base-
man, had three home runs to break
open the first game. Ewing, one
of two seniors on the team, went
3-for-6 on the weekend, notching
a leadoff hit in both the third and
fourth innings of Saturday's game.
Those hits sparked rallies that
resulted in seven total runs.
Kirkpatrick hit leadoff during
the second half of the year, but

k Michigan's batting against Alabama.
after falling into a slump, she was
dropped to eighth in the order.
Before a single in game two against
Baylor, Kirkpatrick's last 15 trips
to the plate went without hitting a
single pitch. If Michigan is going to
get deep in this tournament, then
it needs the bottom of the order to
once again be relevant.
Have a chance going into the
sixth inning: If it is close heading
into the sixth, Michigan has to like
its chances. The Wolverines have
outscored opponents 81-13 in the
final two innings this season. In
the postseason they haven't given
up a run in the sixth or the seventh
- outscoring their opposition 11-0
during their five playoff games.
They are also 32-0 when leading
heading into the sixth inning this
season. The only time they were
trailing going into the sixth in the
postseason was in regional play
against Notre Dame. They scored
two runs in the bottom seventh to
win in walk-off fashion. Michigan
fans shouldn't give up hope if they
trail late.
Leave the nerves in Ann
Arbor: Michigan has only three
people who have been to the
World Series before, all three of
whom are on the coaching staff.
With only one senior in the
starting lineup and no Women's
College World Series experience
on the field, Michigan will need
to overcome that lack of expe-
rience against a Crimson Tide
squad that was in the same posi-.
tion last year. But all season long
the Wolverines have overcome a
lack-of experience, starting five
underclassmen..
Hutchins has preached her
philosophy of one-pitch softball all
season.
Hopefully the choir hasbeen lis-
tening.
