County allocates $145,000 
to immigrant assistance 

Proposed

cut funding

loans, EPA

Resolutions passed 
by County Board of 
Commissioners 
by 

five vote margin

By ALON SAMUEL

Daily Staff Reporter

The Washtenaw County Board 

of Commissioners pledged support 
for the county’s immigrant and 
refugee populations last week, 
approving three resolutions which 
provide protections and allocates 
$145,000 to services for immigrants 
and 
undocumented 
residents. 

The resolutions, which have faced 
resistance on their road to approval, 
passed the board by a vote of 6 to 1.

Two of the three resolutions 

serve to declare the county as 
a 
welcoming 
environment 
for 

immigrants, bar county officials 
from asking for an individual’s 
immigration 
status 
unless 

absolutely necessary — similar to 
an ordinancepassed by Ann Arbor 
City Council in April — and call 
on Congress to make immigration 

policy that “creates clear and 
reasonable immigration sanctions 
short of deportation for noncitizens 
convicted of crimes.”

The final and most controversial 

resolution appropriates $145,000 in 
taxpayer funds, with $70,000 going 
to the Barrier Busters program and 
$75,000 to the Michigan Immigrant 
Rights Center.

MIRC is a resource center 

for immigrants and immigrant 
advocates in Michigan, providing 
legal 
resources 
as 
well 
as 

community services. 

Sara Cusack, an LSA alum who 

now works for MIRC said the new 
allocation is “incredibly useful,” 
speaking for herself and not as a 
representative of MIRC.

“The grant that Washtenaw 

just agreed to give to MIRC… will 
hopefully in the future allow us to 
have an attorney who focuses on 
immigration matters specifically 
in Washtenaw County, whereas 
right now we serve all of Michigan 
broadly and have really limited 
resources,” Cusack said. “We have 
to be very stringent about what 
types of cases we can take, and so 
what Washtenaw county is kind of 

saying by giving this donation to 
MIRC is that they’re investing in 
the wellbeing of immigrants and 
their community.”

Barrier Busters is a coalition 

of 
agencies 
providing 
short-

term human services support in 
Washtenaw county for citizens 
and immigrants alike, though 
$25,000 of the total allocation has 
been specifically earmarked for 
immigrant support.

In early May, when the board had 

initially approved the resolutions, 
commissioner 
Kent 
Martinez-

Kratz was especially enthusiastic 
about funding the Barrier Busters 
program, citing its support for 
families.

“Originally the resolutions were 

written up to support families who 
might be going through difficult 
times due to increased immigration 
enforcement, and we envisioned 
that the money would go to 
supporting them,” Martinez-Kratz 
said.

The possible deportation of 

undocumented Ann Arbor resident 
Jose Luis Sanchez-Ronquillo has 
become a rallying point around

Cuts would result in 
termination of over 
two dozen programs

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

President Donald J. Trump’s 

revised — and first complete — budget 
proposal, released Tuesday, sparked 
controversy among state officials and 
students, particularly with regard to 
spending cuts in higher education 
and environmental protections.

In terms of education, the proposal 

calls for a $9.2 billion spending cut, 
down 13.5 percent from 2017 — the 
same as in the March proposal.

According to The Atlantic, the 

cuts would terminate more than two 
dozen programs.

In a statement, Secretary of 

Education Betsy DeVos said the 
budget “reflects a series of tough 
choices we have had to make when 
assessing the best use of taxpayer 
money,” and “ensures funding for 
programs with proven results for 
students while taking a hard look 
at programs that sound nice but 
simply haven’t yielded the desired 
outcomes.”

The budget would eliminate the 

Federal Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grant program, which 
provides need-based aid to 1.6 million 
undergraduates each year, though is 
sometimes considered subordinate to 
the Pell Grant program — the largest 
federal grant opportunity for low-
income students — which is being 
extended through a year-round Pell 
program.

president 
of

Republicans, does not view the cut

Longtime law professor Martha Jones 
reflects on her 15 years at University

Jones to relocate 
to Johns Hopkins 
after influential 
tenure at U-M

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily News Editor

In 
her 
15 
years 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, History 
Prof. Martha Jones has invested 
much of herself into the campus 
community — and the return 
has not disappointed. As a 
co-director of the Law School’s 
program in Race, Law and 
History, former associate chair of 
the Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies and, most 
recently this winter, her work 
as a Presidential Bicentennial 
professor with the landmark 
Stumbling 
Blocks 
exhibit 
— 

Jones has become somewhat of 
a stalwart in convening campus 
around issues of race and social 
justice.

Jones arrived in Ann Arbor 

the day before 9/11, and — from 
the 
battle 
over 
affirmative 

action and Proposal 2 to Obama 
to Trump to the University’s 
contentious 
celebration 
of 

its 200th year — took part in 
molding the University in the 
years thereafter. This summer, 
though, Jones will relocate to 
Baltimore to join the history 
department at Johns Hopkins 
University. She joined the Daily 
for an exit interview of sorts, 
to reflect on her career at the 
University and the lessons she’s 
taken from this year, and decade, 
of powerful turbulence.

TMD: You’re leaving us! Is the 

move to Baltimore for research 
on your new book, a change of 
scene, or both?

MJ: 16 years is a long time to 

be someplace. The opportunities 
to be closer to my archives was 
really exciting, to have those 
things at my fingertips…. you 
can imagine Baltimore presents 
the kinds of opportunities and 
challenges similar to a city 
like Detroit. In a lot of ways 
at Michigan, I had — at least 
personally — accomplished a 
lot of the things I had hoped to 
accomplish, and more. It seemed 
like the right moment to think 

about a change.

TMD: Your Stumbling Blocks 

exhibit really took ahold of 
campus this semester, and it was 
so interesting to watch those 
conversations 
unfold. 
What 

reactions did you find most 
compelling?

MJ: Wow, after 18 months of 

planning and thinking, it was all 
very compelling. We were really 

lucky that the Sunday we set up 
Stumbling Blocks was warm and 
beautiful, and so while I thought 
we’d just be setting up, I had a 

chance to talk with people very 
informally.

The first people I talked to 

were a mother from Chicago 
and her daughter, a Michigan 
student, 
and 
her 
younger 

daughter, who was thinking 
about 
college. 
They 
were 

African 
American, 
and 
we 

stood together in front of the 
chairs to talk about the history, 
the meaning of the chairs, 
what it’s like to be a student of 
color at Michigan. I watched 
one of my former students, 
who does tours for visitors 
and 
prospectives, 
give 
his 

spiel on the steps of the Union, 
and incorporate the sign on 
the front of the Union into 
students’ first introduction to 
the University.

What we hoped for was just 

that, that people just slow down 
in places like the Diag, Ingalls 
Mall, the Union and stop, read, 
talk, look and look again.

Some people won’t know 

how much goes on behind 
the scenes in order to create 
an 
installation 
like 
this. 

Memorable moments are the 
first night when it rained cats 

and dogs and the power went out 
on the exterior of the Union, and 
there was a team that worked 
with me in the mud getting the 
power back up. I knew I’d be out 
there, but the staff was out there, 
too.

The last category, of course, is 

criticism. I learned a lot myself as 
a thinker, community member, a 
creative person about hanging in 
there for the hard conversations. 
The ones I was a party to were 
emblematic of our capacity to 
have hard conversations when 
we commit to them. And we walk 
away understanding each other 
better and building relationships 
that, I hope, bear fruit. Some 
people didn’t want them to ever 
come down, and I think the pop-
up is important to show the real 
work isn’t in installations on the 
Diag. I think it was right to do 
it for a week and let it generate 
thought, be provocative and then 
send us back to do the work we 
do every day.

TMD: The pop-up provided 

space 
for 
conversations 
and 

pause in a year where it seemed 
like we didn’t really have time 
to stop, where it felt like campus 
was always moving — especially 
after a year of multiple racist 
incidents. How is it that those 
singular, incendiary moments 
can take hold of an entire 
campus? What are your overall 
reflections on this year?

MJ: This work on climate 

requires making a lot of noise, 
all the time. I think the reason 
that we survived this year was 
because people stepped up from 
all kinds of corners of campus 
and made a lot of noise, in a year 
where a lot of other institutions 
haven’t fared as well. That 
noise functioned in a way that 
was bigger than any one poster 
campaign or rally or pop-up. It 
was all of those things happening 
at once. An Expect Respect 
campaign was just a piece, but 
it was one piece of everything 
else, 
the 
counter-postering, 

the rallies around urgency and 
emergency. That’s not to say that 
we’ve reached the goal or solved 
all our concerns, but if it were my 
project for the future, I would 
be about continuing that noise.

University chemists discover environmentally 
friendly method for creating semiconductor films

Team finds cheaper 
method of making 
component of nearly 
all electronic devices

By COLIN BERESFORD

Daily Staff Reporter

A team of chemists at the Uni-

versity of Michigan have devel-
oped a new method to create 
single-crystalline semiconductor 
films, a component of nearly all 
electronic devices. The team, led 
by Stephen Maldonado, associate 
professor of chemistry, invented 
a more environmentally-friendly 
and cheaper method to create 
semiconductor films.

Semiconductors are used to 

create lasers and LEDs due to the 
light they emit when they contain 
impurities, according to the web-
site of the University of Mary-
land’s School of Engineering. 
They are also used to fabricate 
solar cells because of their ability 
to absorb light and generate a cur-

rent.

The process discovered by the 

University of Michigan chem-
ists doesn’t use excess heat and 
doesn’t require the use of hazard-
ous gas. Instead, the team uses 
water at room temperature and 
easy-to-make equipment to cre-
ate the crystalline semiconductor 
films.

In 
an 
email, 
Maldonado 

detailed what inspired him and 
his group to develop this new 
method for creating semiconduc-
tors — emphasizing their interest 
in discovering “greener ways to do 
useful chemistry.”

“But another pertinent moti-

vation for this particular work 
is a desire to build upon a simple 
finding we came across several 
years ago,” Maldonado wrote. 
“We discovered serendipitously 
liquid metals are useful sol-
vents for semiconductor crystal 
growth even at room temperature. 
Accordingly, we have been really 
motivated to push this concept 
as far as possible, both for large 
materials (this work) and nano-
materials (other works of ours).” 

The method is more environ-

mentally friendly due to the lack 
of heat and hazardous gases.

“If you don’t have to input ener-

gy to generate high temperatures, 
low vacuums, or reactive precur-
sor molecules (gases), the energy 
cost and potential environmental 
impact of the process are nec-
essarily 
lowered,” 
Maldonado 

wrote.

Rackham student Daniel Bier, a 

student in the Erb institute, wrote 
in an email to the Daily he would 
want to reserve judgement on how 
much greener the newly devel-
oped method is, considering the 
number of factors that can affect 
the environmental impact of this 
technology.

“It’s easy to say that something 

is green, but to evaluate how 
much ‘greener’ this technology 
is, you should consider how this 
new approach will impact energy 
and material consumption across 
the supply chain,” he wrote. 
“This includes the environmental 
impact of purchasing new capital 
equipment to build the chips and 
the amount of energy and raw

materials involved in manufactur-
ing.”

Bier also said the change in 

impact could be very small and by 
making electronics cheaper, more 
could be thrown away.

“The biggest question for me is 

how ‘material’ is this new technol-
ogy from an environmental per-
spective: is the change in energy or 
material use significant, or just a 
few percentage points?” he wrote. 
“Would this make producing elec-
tronics so much cheaper that overall 
manufacturing volumes skyrocket, 
leading to devices becoming more 
disposable and ending up in land-
fills?”

How this discovery will change 

how semiconductors are created 
in the future and on a large scale 
is largely unknown, but has the 
potential to create waves in the 
electronics industry, Maldonado 
said.

“What we developed in our lab 

is properly best thought of as a pro-
totype,” Maldonado wrote. “We 
are (predominantly) not engineers 
in my group, so we have not been 
focused on the challenges of scale 

or designing a fabrication assembly 
line.”

The finding is incredibly impor-

tant in respect to how different it is 
from the traditional way to produce 
semiconductor films, Maldonado 
said. While the method needs more 
work, it has shown what is possible.

“I think they (the findings) are 

important because they demon-
strate a radically different way 
to make useful materials,” Mal-
donado said. “Basically, we use 
electrical energy to drive crys-
tallization rather than thermal 
energy. This work shows that 
with this concept you can take a 
raw oxidized source and directly 
convert it into a highly crystal-
line semiconductor. By playing 
with aspects of the system, we 
have shown that we can control 
exactly where and how crystal-
lization occurs.”

Maldonado is optimistic about 

the progress his team has made 
so far.

“We’re not there yet, but we’re 

a lot closer than I thought we 
would ever be before we started 
this work.”

this very topic in recent months. 
Sanchez-Ronquillo, 
who 
is 
a 

father of two, was acquitted from 
deportation in 2014 but detained 
again in April after requesting 
a stay, sparking protests from 
the Ann Arbor community. On 
Tuesday, 
community 
action 

resulted in a federal judge’s 
decision to delay the deportation.

Commissioner Conan Smith, 

who introduced the resolutions, 
said community mobilization has 
been crucial in work on the topic.

However, support for these 

resolutions and others like them 
have not been uniform.

During public hearing before 

the 
initial 
vote, 
Northfield 

Township Trustee Tawn Beliger 
said placing the interests of the 
undocumented 
was 
grounds 

for recalling an elected official, 
adding 
that 
taxpayer 
money 

would be better spent on fixing 
roads, as reported by MLive.

Additionally, the resolutions 

have been framed in response 

to actions of President Donald 
Trump’s 
administration 
— 

the resolution which calls on 
Congress to restrict deportations 
mentions the President explicitly 
— which may be disagreeable to 
those who voted for him in the 
2016 elections and support his 
policies. In Washtenaw County, 
this amounts to 26.5 percent of 
those who voted. 

Still, advocates maintain that 

making Washtenaw County a 
welcoming environment in such 
trying times is a worthy cause.

Margaret Rapai, an LSA senior 

and incoming president of the 
Michigan 
Refugee 
Assistance 

Program — which volunteers, 
advocates 
and 
educates 
on 

refugee issues — said such 
policies are important to ensuring 
the United States stays a place of 
hope for immigrants. MRAP is not 
specifically involved with support 
for undocumented residents, but 
according to Rapai, the goals of 
the resolutions are in line with 
theirs by creating communal 
support for newcomers.

as a loss, seeing as the program 
has been deemed inefficient.

“A large portion of this budget 

cut comes from the reduction 
of the Supplemental Education 
Opportunity Grant, an outdated 
program 
that 
gives 
money 

directly to colleges as opposed 
to low-income students,” he said 
in a March interview. 

Cuts have also been made 

to the TRIO and GEAR UP 
programs, 
which 
serve 
to 

support 
low-income 
students 

and those from disadvantaged 
backgrounds. 
Seeing 
as 
the 

University has come under fire 
for low rates of socioeconomic 
diversity, LSA senior Rowan 
Conybeare, 
chair 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said in a March 
interview 
the 
University’s 

diversity 
will 
be 
damaged 

without these programs.

OPINION

A 

few 
weeks 
ago, 
while 

scrolling through Twitter, 
I saw yet another analysis 

of the new controversial hit Netflix 
show “Dear White People.” Since 
its release, it seems as though I 
have seen dozens of reactions, some 
expressing praise for the show’s 
authentic 
and 
brutally 
honest 

perspective, others critiquing its 
perpetuation of “generalizations” 
and refutation of the show’s themes 
regarding 
the 
Black-American 

experience. However, there is a 
striking difference between the 
analysis I stumbled upon on Twitter 
and the dozens of other critiques I 
have read throughout the past few 
weeks. The tweet read, “I think 
“Dear White People” the Netflix 
series is based on a University of 
Michigan-like campus.” I instantly 
re-tweeted and liked it. Here’s why.

“Dear White People” focuses on 

the lives of various college students 
attending Winchester University, 
a fictional Ivy League school, and 
follows several racially charged 
incidents, including a blackface-
themed 
party, 
racial 
profiling, 

micro-aggressions and problematic 
relations with campus police. The 
show offers insight to the unfolding 
of these events through multiple 
perspectives; Sam, a radio host and 
leader of the Black Student Union 
deemed “radical,” Troy, president of 
the student body, and Lionel, writer 
for one of Winchester’s newspapers, 
and various others. 

Now you may be wondering, “What 

in the world would a show like that 
have to do with the University of 

Michigan?” Quite frankly, if you 
have to ask, then you are one of 
the people Sam is addressing each 
time she begins her radio show 
with the statement “Dear white 
people,” highlighting an instance in 
which an individual exhibits totally 
uncultured 
behavior, 
excessive 

lack of intercultural competence 
or unenlightened thought. Let me 
break it down.

1. The term “micro-aggressions” is 

defined as “the casual degradation of 
any socially marginalized group.” In 
recent years, micro-aggressions have 
festered and bubbled like infectious 
sores on college campuses. They 
are depicted frequently throughout 
“Dear White People,” and I couldn’t 
help but notice that some of the 
same ones displayed on screen eat, 
sleep and breathe on the University’s 
campus. For example, I cannot even 
begin to tell you the amount of times 
I’ve gotten the “So … what are you?” 
and “You’re mixed with what…?” 
questions 
since 
my 
freshman 

year from members of Black and 
white communities alike. Or, the 
immediate assumption that I only 
listen to rap music. By the way, I am 
Black, and unbeknownst to many, I 
still bump the Jonas Brothers.

2. 
Michigan 
is 
much 
more 

segregated than you would imagine. 
Though there isn’t a historically 
Black residence hall which serves 
as a haven for the Black community 
as reflected in “Dear White People,” 
you will find that most parties and 
various other social events/aspects 
of social life on campus are distinctly 
segregated — as I once found myself 

at a party in which a congregation of 
only Black people packed themselves 
in the basement of a house, and 
everyone else (majority the white 
community) remained upstairs or 
outside. It becomes easy to fall victim 
to the unspoken understanding that 
as a member of a specific community 
you should only participate in 
social groups/events that reflect its 
likeness.

3. 
Winchester, 
the 
fictional 

university 
depicted 
in 
“Dear 

White People,” is an Ivy receiving 
significantly 
large 
endowments 

from various donors who actively 
participate 
in 
campus 
policy, 

politics and decision making. In 
2016, the University of Michigan 
found itself ranked 7th on U.S. News 
“10 Universities with the Biggest 
Endowments,” just falling shy of $11 
billion dollars. As the plot unfolds in 
the show, it is clear that the dollars 
donated to Winchester speak much 
louder than the calls of action voiced 
by the student body. It is safe to say 
our campus has encountered similar 
experiences like this in which the 
politics of administration and the 
money associated with it often 
overshadow real campus ongoings.

4. The epicenter of “Dear White 

People” is the response of students 
to a blackface party and racial 
profiling at the hands of campus 
police. As I am sure everyone is 
aware, in recent years there have 
been 
countless 
racially-charged 

incidents at the University — some of 
which seemingly go unnoticed. For 
example, the ever-constant cultural 
appropriation when it comes to

Halloween costumes, or even Central

5. Depicted in the show, resistance 

in the forms of organizing and 
protest serve as ways for all members 
of the student body to express their 
concern regarding incidents on 
campus. As for the University, the 
same can be said. For example, 
this was seen through the Being 
Black at the University of Michigan 
(#BBUM) movement, which gained 
national traction in 2013, or even 
now — Students4Justice.

The University of Michigan does

In fact, dozens of universities

the 

same occurrences. So that poses the 
question, are the writers/producers 
and creators of the show wrong for 
creating such a controversial title 
from which many take offense? Or 
right for using a proactive title to 
capture the attention of audiences 
in order to highlight the experience 
of Black students at predominantly 
white institutions? I believe the 
answer to this lies within the end of 
each episode. In every closing scene, 
the actor/actors stare directly into 
the lens, locking eyes with the viewer, 
as if they are speaking directly to us, 
asking the question, “So what do you 
think?”

So, what do you think?

W 

hen I was 11 years 
old, my parents and I 
took an eight-day trip 

to England. It was my first time 
outside the country and my first 
time becoming well acquainted 
with any object or building that 
significantly predated 1620, the 
year of Plymouth Rock. In England I 
loved to imagine myself as a person 
living in whatever time period a 
church was built, or whatever time 
period an object came from. Doing 
this allowed me to connect with a 
place and its people, through past 
and present.

I specifically remember being 

inside St. Paul’s Cathedral, when 
our tour guide pointed toward the 
place Queen Victoria sat, right at 
the front, toward the left facing 
the altar. People in the tour group 
wowed audibly, but by the time the 
guide finished telling us about the 
place, the rest of the group had other 
things on their minds and dispersed 
elsewhere under the high arches. I 
rushed over to the guide and asked 
if I could sit in one of the chairs by 
Queen Victoria’s spot. With her 
affirmative answer I walked to 
the front row, seated myself, took 
a deep inhale, and tuned out the 
footsteps and murmurs echoing off 
the stone sanctuary walls. I fixed 
my eyes on the altar in front of me 
and imagined I was Victoria, a long 
time ago, watching Prince Charles 
in a traditional suit and Princess 
Diana in puffy white dress on the 
day of their marriage.

At the time it did not occur to 

me that Victoria would have been 
162 years old on the date of Charles 
and Diana’s wedding, but it also 
didn’t matter. As I imagined myself, 

Victoria, I had greased dark hair 
with a part directly through the 
center of my head, and layers of 
fabric from my ginormous skirt 
cushioned my seat. Sitting in St. 
Paul’s Cathedral, I saw at the gilded 
altar in front of me Charles gazing 
down at Diana. She was staring up 
at him with shining blue eyes, chin 
extended upward in a way that 
accentuated the dramatic jaw line 
I’d seen in pictures. I sat upright 
and stern, serious as Victoria 
looked in carbon prints. A chill ran 
through my blood and goosebumps 
raised on my forearms. I felt I 
communed with Victoria then. I 
lived some aspect of her experience 
by sitting where I knew she sat, 
watching something I believed she 
saw. I had never felt that before, not 
with someone who was alive so long 
before me.

This happened over and over 

on that trip. We visited the Tower 
of London, walked under the tall, 
gray arch that was the prisoners’ 
entrance, and I imagined myself 
walking into the stone structure as 
if it was the last place I’d be before 
my final punishment. We saw the 
chopping block that was apparently 
used to decapitate Anne Boleyn and 
I imagined myself, chin resting in 
the part of the block carved out for 
the head. Each time the same cool 
sensation tore through me; each 
time the goosebumps came and I 
felt I understood something true of 
life that came before me.

OPINION

Thursday, May 25, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T 

he night of November 9, 
2016, Van Jones turned 
to the CNN cameras in 

the studio and remarked, “This 
[election] was a whitelash against 
a changing country.” After staring 
at the screen, I too was taken aback 
by the result. My perspective on 
the state of our country had been 
shattered, and I knew I wasn’t the 
only one. After the next few days, 
I remember hearing and reading 
about the abuse against Muslims, 
African-Americans, 
Asians, 

women, and so many people. 
Among all of this (continued) 
chaos, I would still come back to my 
apartment and look in the mirror, 
and see a white male staring back. 
It reminded me that I have never 
been approached on the sidewalk 
and had a racial slur thrown at me, 
nor have I been sexually assaulted. 
The lack of these acts, without one 
doubt, is due mostly because I am 
a white male. I am at a significant 
advantage. Nevertheless, when 
reading, listening and discussing 
the 
racial 
and 
ethnic 
issues 

stemming from the election, I have 
been asking myself, “Is a white man 
allowed to have a valid opinion on 
racial or gender relations?”

There is no doubt in my mind 

that I am privileged. How do 
I know? I rarely think about 
my race or my gender, and it is 
only in certain contexts where 
I am forced to reckon with my 
position. In my introspection, 
I realize there are two types 
of white men on the “privilege 
spectrum:” those who have no 
regard for their privilege, and 
those who often apologize for 
or demean themselves because 
of their privilege. I realize that 
the personal white shaming, 
especially on our own college 
campuses, is rather prevalent 
and overblown. Although there 
is no doubt that the white man 
is the most privileged gender 
and race in western history, 
I have struggled to recognize 
what is appropriate to say as a 
white man on our campus. To 

gain approval from my peers 
who are minorities, do I not 
speak about the things sexist and 
racial oppression I observe? Do 
I downplay my “whiteness” and 
“masculinity?” If I say something 
not in line with the identity 
politics today, am I a sexist or 
racist?

As 
stated 
previously, 
I 

understand I am privileged, and 
I am reminded when I work with 
refugees and hear news about 
the oppression of women and 
minorities. Nonetheless, I feel 
that because of my lack of personal 

experience 
with 
racism 
and 

sexism as a victim, my opinions 
from observation are viewed as 
unjustified. Whenever I voice an 
opinion about race relations in 
class, there seems to be a massive 
asterisk saying, “Here is a white 
male.” For example, I recently 
participated in a class for my 
race and ethnicity requirement. 
I appreciated that my discussion 
section was diverse and included 
many 
unique 
perspectives; 

however, 
whenever 
I 
spoke 

about race relations, there was 
this “asterisk.” My peers and my 
GSI told me that I “really didn’t 
understand,” and in turn, I was 
seemingly ignored by my GSI 
when I raised my hand. For me, 
this was somewhat concerning. I 
had “checked” my privilege, and I 
wasn’t about to downplay for my 
“whiteness” or “maleness” to gain 
support from my class. While I am 
a white male, I have tried to listen 
to minorities, but can I voice my 

perspective on what I’ve learned 
from their experiences?

When 
I 
read 
about 
the 

frustrations 
of 
many 
people 

with 
“political 
correctness 

culture” on college campuses, I 
think we are encroaching on a 
dangerous balance. Our college 
generation 
is 
more 
inclusive 

than any generation previously, 
and many people from white 
backgrounds 
understand 
their 

privilege and work to help race 
relations. Nevertheless, as John 
McWhorter, an African-American 
contributor to CNN, wrote, white 
people in PC culture are expected 
to “endlessly apologize,” and “they 
feel damned if they do, damned if 
they don’t.” As a white man, I am 
unsure if having immense “white 
guilt” and being quiet about race 
relations is constituted as being 
moral. For myself, I believe it 
is important to have education 
and historical awareness of the 
oppression of many minorities 
faced and continue to endure 
in this country. However, I am 
not sure if removing all people, 
regardless of skin tone or gender, 
helps continue the discussion.

People 
from 
all 
different 

backgrounds, regardless of gender 
or race should never stop fighting 
the 
racism 
that 
still 
exists. 

Nevertheless, if we want to be 
a wholly inclusive society, that 
means we need to listen to people 
from all different races, genders, 
and religions. The “asterisk” will 
always exist for me, but I hope 
that the intentions to improve race 
and gender relations of a white 
male are perceived with more 
value than the color of his skin or 
the gender to which he belongs. 
How can we as white men listen 
more to minorities but not shame 
ourselves for our identity? How do 
we voice our opinions?

My asterisk
Assessing Jeff Sessions’ drug policy
A

nn Arbor is a city defined by 
its university, football, food 
and great culture. Locals 

and students will quickly praise 
and boast these features; however, 
a huge part of Ann Arbor less likely 
to headline brochures has been its 
progressive stance and cultural 
acceptance of marijuana. In fact, 
just this past April, Ann Arbor 
hosted its 46th annual Hash Bash, a 
clear celebration of marijuana.

Additionally, the city was at the 

forefront of medical marijuana 
legalization, making an initiative in 
2004, four years prior to the state of 
Michigan as a whole in 2008. The 
city has been progressive in its drug 
policy, and now more than ever it is 
critical that the city continues to be.

On May 12, Attorney General 

Jeff Sessions issued a memo that 
instructs federal prosecutors to 
pursue the harshest sentences 
on 
drug-related 
crimes. 
This 

effectively 
works 
to 
reverse 

Obama-era 
policies 
looking 
to 

mitigate punishments for low-
level, 
nonviolent 
drug 
crimes. 

Instead of prosecutors avoiding 
charging defendants for offenses 
that trigger mandatory minimum 
sentences, prosecutors will now 
have to seek the strongest charges 
possible for the crime. This will 
inevitably 
increase 
mandatory 

minimum 
sentencing 
and 
add 

nonviolent 
offenders 
to 
our 

already 
overcrowded 
prisons. 

Mandatory minimums require that 
specific offenses have inflexible 
prison terms. This is infamously 
problematic because it not only 
requires drug offenders to serve 
needlessly long sentences, but also 
more severely punishes drugs that 
traditionally target the lower-class. 
This is exemplified through the 
disparity between crack cocaine 
and powder cocaine: it requires 
eighteen times as much powder 
cocaine as crack cocaine to receive 
the same mandatory minimum 
term. This is only the beginning 
of stronger stances against crime 
from this administration. Sessions 
is undoing Obama’s progress on 
drug policy by reverting to laws 
set in place by Congress years ago. 
This is a memo aimed to rejuvenate 
the War on Drugs — a war slowed 
significantly by Obama’s policies.

This being said, now is not the 

time to rejuvenate the War on 
Drugs. Crime rates are near an all-
time low, and even recent increases 
in violent crimes in cities like 
Chicago are not solved through 
tougher drug policies. However, the 

U.S. prison population remains the 
largest in the world, and 52 percent 
of federally-sentenced offenders 
were drug-related in 2012. This 
doesn’t even touch on the many who 
are not incarcerated but harassed 
and even arrested by police over 
drug possession, such as the man 
raided and arrested over a gram 
and a half of marijuana in Richland 
County, S.C., as documented in the 
film “Do Not Resist.”

The War on Drugs was and will 

continue to be an ineffective way 
to combat the drug problem in our 
country. It needlessly increased 
the incarcerated population while 
not taking any aims to rehabilitate 
users or remedy the poverty 
that 
births 
drug 
trafficking. 

Additionally, there is plenty of 
research published that shows that 
it has disproportionately affected 
minorities in America. One in 
three Black men ages 20 to 29 
are incarcerated, and mandatory 
minimums on drug possession and 
trafficking will not help improve 
those numbers.

If you don’t believe the statistics 

that prove it, the fact that Ann 
Arbor residents and students at the 
prestigious University of Michigan 
can participate in a Hash Bash 
— glorifying the consumption of 
marijuana — without consequence, 
while Black South Carolinians 
are raided by police teams over 
marijuana proves there is a level of 
privilege in the matter.

Now that our Attorney General 

is reinforcing antiquated federal 
laws on drug punishment, it is 
important that cities and states 
pass initiatives to make more 
sensible drug policies. Supporting 
organizations such as the Drug 
Policy Alliance is critical to those 
initiatives. And when the state 
of Michigan proposes marijuana 
legalization in 2018, I urge those 
who can to vote in favor. It is only 
a step to more comprehensive 
drug policy reform but a huge one 
nonetheless.

Residents of Ann Arbor have 

benefited from lenient marijuana 
laws and have had the privilege of 
celebrating a Hash Bash festival 
free from penalty while much of 
the nation cannot. It is the duty of 
those of us with the freedom from 
draconian drug policy to support 
progress for those without that 
privilege.

Iceland’s beauty 
and mysticism 

By ERIKA SHEVCHEK

Daily Community Culture Editor

Iceland is a place that allows 

people to travel through a special 
feeling of space and time. While 
thriving in its history, soaking 
in the present and embracing 
each and every new concept that 
comes its way, the large island 
fully meditates on what it means 
to be Icelandic.

It’s 
a 
country 
rumbling 

with beauty and surprise. One 
moment, I’m looking at the 
Harpa, a geometric-eye-puzzle 
filled with sprinkling colors 
against its deep, black setting; 
I’m amazed at this architecture 
that serves as the main con-
cert hall. And the next moment, 
to the right, is the too-large-
to-be-real-but-is-so-real 
Esja 

mountain, standing stalwartly 
along the coastline — an iconic 
image Reykjavik stares at every 
day. Not to mention, this time 
of year it’s 24 hours of daylight, 
which makes this place far more 
intriguing (and for its people, 
well, far more tiring).

Although the capital — home 

to 2/3rds of the country’s popu-
lation — stands proudly next to 
the Atlantic ocean and the rough 
mountain coast, it’s tiny — really 
tiny. Nevertheless, it prides itself 
on being an urban, zesty and 
bouncy city with colorful roof-
tops and stone streets.

But that’s what Iceland is 

about: the dichotomy and the 
osmosis of urban and natural, 
real and mystical, inhabited and 
deserted.

Last Thursday I had the plea-

sure of seeing two Icelandic 
music groups, MilkyWhale and 
Gangly, at a local bar venue, 
Húrra, in downtown Reykjavik. 
Not knowing what to expect, I 
had learned that these two art-
ists are living symbols of Iceland.

MilkyWhale, 
a 
high-ener-

gy pop duo consisting of two 
friends, Mel and Arni, brought 
a new style of performance: the 
concept of performance art. The 
creator of the group, Mel, was 
a choreographer when she met 
Arni in his band. Soon enough, 
the two were creating their 

spunky tunes with Mel’s high 
soprano voice and Arni’s beats 
and occasionally deep bass inter-
ludes.

Needless to say, they got me on 

my feet.

My five other friends and I 

jumped and bumped to the col-
orful melodies that MilkyWhale 
produced. And it wasn’t even 
her voice that got us going. Mel’s 
dancing and poppy energy made 
the crowd light up and was gen-
uinely too grand for the tight 
venue. I told her that she should 
make her way to a larger stage 
(maybe Hill Auditorium?).

“It’s nice to have people to 

dance with!” she told the audi-
ence in her sweet accent.

Aesthetically, she’s an Icelan-

dic princess and Arni is her dj-
ing partner in prime. Together, 
they are taking on the fresh and 
upbeat style that is musical per-
formance art. Their vibe screams 
something like “we want you to 
love your life, get off your ass 
and let loose.” And no matter 
where in the world I go, I know I 
could always use that motto.

The mood of the night changed 

swiftly when the next group, 
Gangly, took the stage. The trio’s 
deep bass but soft vibes gave the 
crowd a sense of sensuality, zen 
and mysticism. In a way, they 
sounded like a more hypnotic, 
relaxing version of The xx.

On another planet far away 

from MilkyWhale, Gangly’s vibe 
screams something like “let’s 
take this to the bedroom.”

With the falsettos of the two 

male and one female group, the 
harmonies created were sensi-
tive and somewhat sexy. They 
project this sense of calmness 
and serenity, a mood that Iceland 
closely resembles.

Iceland and its regal moun-

tains, majestic glaciers and stun-
ning waterfalls all come together 
to create its own unique magic. 
Gangly helps echo that same 
tone by mastering their ethereal 
sound. Icelandic music, includ-
ing the world-renowned music 
groups Of Monsters and Men and 
Kaleo, might just be the freshest 
breath of air the music industry, 
nationally and internationally, 
truly needs.

‘Unbreakable Kimmy’ 
excels in third season 

LETTER FROM REYKJAVÍK

NETFLIX

Ellie Kemper and Tituss Burgess “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” 

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

“The 
Unbreakable 
Kimmy 

Schmidt,” 
a 
Netflix 
Original 

Series, returned to online stream-
ing on May 20th to debut its third 
season after a year of anticipa-
tion. 
Back 
online, 
“Unbreak-

able” continues to 
dazzle fans with a 
spectacular conti-
nuity of its social 
commentary 
and 

innocent 
jokes. 

This season in par-
ticular, it’s not just 
about the titular 
Kimmy (Ellie Kem-
per, “The Office”), 
as we see character 
growth in support-
ing cast members 
as well as humor 
that is more devel-
oped than the preceding seasons.

After three years of program-

ming, one would think that 
“Unbreakable” would begin to 
lose that spark that gives the series 
its special something. However, 
the social commentary that cre-
ators Tina Fey and Robert Carlock 
have woven into “Unbreakable” in 
the past comes to the forefront in 
Season 3, giving “Unbreakable” its 
best season yet. Fey and Carlock 
take on the issues of race, poli-
tics and sexual assault head-on 
this season, not shying away from 
openly taking on cases of sexual 
assault with the same finesse and 
humor as before. Last season saw 
Kimmy take on her PTSD with 

guest-star therapist Tina Fey (“30 
Rock”); however, this season finds 
her becoming more comfortable 
discussing her past in the bunker, 
going as far as to mention rape in 
the third episode of the season.

As far as comedy goes, the 

humor is as sharp as ever. Where 
jokes were once interjected, some-

times 
awkwardly 

and at expense of 
the plot, this season 
shows jokes inter-
woven 
delicately 

with the dialogue, 
and in a way that the 
cast feels more com-
fortable with.

Meanwhile, 

Titus Andromedon 
(Tituss 
Burgess, 

“Catfight”) is gain-
ing more screentime 
this season, promot-
ing him from come-

dic sidekick to star of the show. 
While the previous two seasons 
of “Unbreakable” focused primar-
ily on the advancement of Titus’s 
career — who can forget Peeno 
Noir? — Season three takes his 
personal life head-on, especially 
in regards to his relationship 
with Michael (Mike Carlsen, 
“30 Rock”). In arguably the best 
scene of the season thus far, 
Titus dons a yellow dress and 
accompanying baseball bat to 
“Lemonade” his way through 
the city. It’s difficult to keep a 
straight face as Titus struts the 
streets with signature twirl and 
smile — it’s a scene that’s authen-
tically pulled off, encompassing 

the best of “Unbreakable” in 
under five minutes.

Since Titus’s Beyoncé break-

out, it’s becoming clear that the 
series is becoming less about 
Kimmy and focusing more on the 
supporting cast. However, this is 
more of a good thing for Netflix-
based series than a pitfall. In fact, 
this goes to show how the series 
in ways others of the same nature 
don’t. Just as “The Office” focused 
equally on each member of its 
cast, “Unbreakable” is following a 
similar path.

However, it’s still refreshing 

to see Kimmy in the spotlight as 
she continues to grow. Unlike 
past seasons, Kimmy feels more 
mature, falling out of her hope-
less optimism. She’s understand-
ing that, as much as she wants or 
as hard as she ultimately tries, 
she simply cannot fix everything. 
And though she remains oblivious 
about some aspects of the world, 
she’s becoming wiser and more 
focused on what she wants to 
and what it will take to get there. 
Kimmy has gone from mindlessly 
advising Xanthipee (Dylan Gelu-
la, “Chasing Life”) to taking on a 
parent-like figure that supports 
her and gives straight-shooting 
advice. In a way, Kimmy has final-
ly grown up. She’s finally in con-
trol of her own life and taking on 
the world with a renewed vigor 
that gives purpose and humor to 
the newest season.

Season 3 of the “Unbreakable 

Kimmy Schmidt” is currently 
streaming exclusively on Netflix.

StudioWOS: A boundary-less artist aims to #RemixTheWorld

By SAL DIGIOIA

Daily Arts Writer 

Being a visual artist has never 

been tougher than it is today, with 
the internet and social media offering 
audiences constant distractions. Yet, 
for Nicholas Osella, a recent graduate 
from the University of Texas at Aus-
tin, the field’s new challenges repre-
sent opportunities for reinvention. 
Working under the alias StudioWOS, 
Osella creates unique collages that 
remix the world according to his own 
imagining, sometimes even using ele-
ments of popular culture.

“Nowadays, it’s incredibly hard 

to even get one person’s attention,” 
said WOS. “I constantly take that as 
a challenge to be the loudest voice in 
the room.”

Through email exchanges and a 

phone conversation, the Michigan 
Daily spoke with StudioWOS about 
his creative process, artistic evolution 
and most recent magazine, MAGNO-
LiA. Excerpts of the conversations 
can be seen below.

***
When did you first start thinking of 

yourself as an artist?

“I’ve always filled sketchbooks 

and pursued a lifestyle of an artist. It 
kind of just came naturally. In high 
school I often thought about what I 
would do in college — would I pursue 
a degree in art or study some other 
field that could provide me with com-
fort? Long story short, I went with 
the latter and fell into graphic design. 
The experience I gained has abso-
lutely influenced my style. Especially 
in my recent work, I’ve taken a more 
‘designerly’ way of thinking.”

You seem willing to express yourself 

through infinite types of mediums. Did 

you always view art as such a border-
less process?

“It was last year, around the sum-

mer, that I realized I can’t make 
everything perfect. I started painting 
on chairs with some of my friends — 
that eventually led to me finding TVs, 
clothes, mannequins and buying stuff 
specifically to paint on. I’d spend five 
minutes painting on something with 
the goal of not spending multiple 
hours on making a line perfect. I just 
wanted to have fun again. It’s still 
probably the most fun I’ve ever had 
as an artist.

I think allowing myself to actu-

ally express myself honestly and be 
organic in my process has tapped into 
some weird subconscious process 
that is really interesting to see come 
through after such a long time of forc-
ing myself onto these 3x4’ canvases.”

Your older work is more cartoon-

ish than the more recent stuff. Is ani-
mation a style of storytelling that you 
were particularly focused on? I noticed 
the The Assassination of Animation 
Zine (published in 2013) while scrolling 
through your Instagram.

“In my freshman year of high 

school, one of my best friends had 
just died, and I was really struggling 
to find myself. The characters I drew 
around that time helped me cope 
with the changing of scenery. They 
let me talk about things I wouldn’t 
have been able to without them — 
death, happiness, love — all things I 
was really passionate about, but too 
timid to show.

I don’t really rely on them any-

more, since I’ve been getting more in 
front of my work and trying to put my 
face first. (But) even though I don’t 
use them, I haven’t lost my ability 
to tell stories or create narratives — 
that’s still really present in my work.”

Your recent work feels more modern 

than illustrations alone could. How is it 
different approaching a photograph of 
a celebrity as opposed to working with 
a truly blank page?

“I usually warm up by drawing on 

blank pieces of paper. I’ll cut them out 
of my sketchbook and just numb my 
brain to some music and see where 
that takes me. After, I’ll start work-
ing up to remixing photographs and 
sewing, but it just takes a different 
muscle to do all of that work. I love 
working on each of them and I take 
great pride in my sketches. Most of 
the time, though, it’s much easier to 
show a picture of Kendrick Lamar 
and have people immediately asso-
ciate with that. That’s just common 
human behavior.”

What was it like to work on a project 

as grand as MAGNOLiA? It seems like 
you both created a magazine and re-
approached it afterward.

“What’s weird is that MAGNOLiA 

was never really supposed to happen; 
De (the photographer/stylist) and I 
met to just take pictures of me work-
ing in my room. I thought the pictures 
would be cool, but then it turned 
into this huge thing. I asked if he’d 
be interested in doing a zine and he 
agreed. I spent another month work-
ing and re-working, and came out 
with a zine that has 40 pages. It was 
a really organic process — I worked 
on the pictures at night, failed a few 
tests. I really took my time on each 
spread. If something was forced, or 
wasn’t working, I moved on to the 
next.

After I finished the book, I didn’t 

really know what to do with it. I 
showed it to De and a few other peo-
ple, but part of me thinks that I made 
it for myself. I’d love to do something 
similar for someone else — a musician 
or photographer. If I had all the time 
in the world, and a full arsenal of sup-
plies, I could probably take over the 
world. Remix the world!”

You told Study Breaks: “Now (art-

ists) have to make something that elic-
its a specific response, something that 
engages a little more directly. Some-
thing that makes someone say, ‘I would 
destroy a TV to cover it in that thing. 
I’d wear it to a concert. I’d wear it to a 
fashion show.’”

A lot of artists probably view that 

as a negative, but you seem like an out-
lier to that mentality, a creative who 
is inspired by the challenge of people’s 
shorter attention spans.

“As an artist, it’s my job to chal-

lenge the viewer’s sense of reality. 
If you think about what was going 
around in the 1950’s and ‘60s, art-
ists constantly re-invented how art 
could be perceived. Pop Art, Abstract 

Expressionism — I mean all of that 
shit was their way of taking the world 
around them and putting it in a way 
you could kind of understand. I love 
that.

I think we need to realize that 

technology is going to be changing 
not just interpersonal connections, 
but like, the landscape of human 
behavior. And with that, art will 
one hundred percent change. We’re 
already not going to galleries. If we 
are, it’s so people can see us going to 
galleries.

It’s disheartening, but if we’re not 

taking these as challenges to work 
other angles, then would you really 
consider yourself with the likes of 
Warhol or Jackson Pollack? Meet 
the problem with an answer— or 
die. “Create, or Die” is something my 
friends and I say a lot.”

Some of your most recent pieces 

have involved remixing photographs 
of famous hip-hop personalities, while 
some of your favorite artists have 
strong connections to streetwear. Do 
you think that artists are empowered 
through these less conventional col-
laborations, since the final products 
can sometimes gain attention from a 
larger, more diverse audience?

“I’d agree with you, but that was 

never how I looked at beginning this 
series. Earlier this year, around Feb-
ruary, I started remixing big books 
and magazines to just see what that 
was like. I used an Hermes catalog as 
a sketchbook for about half a year. I’d 
paint inside of it, chain stitch inside, 
tape pieces of paper to existing pieces. 
I tore that book apart and by the end it 
didn’t even look like an Hermes cata-
log. That’s where I started.

Around the time GunnerStahl 

started getting more recognized, I 
started printing out his photos and 
using them. The first one I did was a 
picture of A$AP Rocky, and I’ve done 
a lot of Gunner’s pictures since. His 
style is incredible. When I first start-
ed to post them on Twitter, people 

actually started fucking with them. 
Turns out, when you put music and 
art together, people actually like it a 
lot. Just another problem I met with 
an answer.

What artists like the GONZ do for 

brands like Supreme is to have them 
associate with the culture around art. 
Take the skateboard brand Illegal 
Civilization — all of the graphics are 
made by one guy, Ryder McLaugh-
lin. He has a crazy style that people 
recognize. I don’t know if that’s what 
makes them successful, but it works 
for their brand.”

You also told Study Breaks that 

you’re “focused on turning Studio-
WOS into a brand.” Do you mean that 
you literally want to push StudioWOS 
clothing in the future, or are you just 
speaking on the brand-i-fication of art 
that has occurred in the digital age, 
and the new ways that artists are being 
forced to market themselves?

“Let me start by saying, Lil Yachty 

is one of the most interesting people 
on the planet. I’ve heard him inter-
view a few times on the process of 
turning himself into a brand — the 
stories about him dyeing his hair red, 
or (deciding) to only wear Nautica 
clothing. Now we immediately asso-
ciate these things with him. What-
ever game we’re all playing, he won.

I saw this going on and I thought, 

fuck, that’s amazing, I can do that too. 
I started thinking about how I could 
make myself and StudioWOS into 
a brand that people could identify 
with. I started painting on my clothes 
and creating more and more new art. 
What I’ve been pushing a lot is kind of 
just the name. Call it brand recogni-
tion, call it whatever you want, that’s 
the most important thing right now.

But you’re right, artists are now 

having to market themselves to get 
noticed. I wish that wasn’t the case 
— we lose such creativity when we 
have to force people into boxes. I 
guess whatever is easier for people, 
y’know?”

Smoke’s Poutinerie to bring poutine to Ann Arbor

By AMARA SHAIKH

Daily Staff Reporter

Smoke’s 
Poutinerie 
has 

arrived in Ann Arbor just in time 
for summer, bringing with it a 
wide selection of customizable 
poutine entrees. Poutine is a 
popular Canadian dish made up 

of fries, gravy and cheese curds. 
Also joining the Poutinerie will 
be The Beaver Trap, an on-site 
bar featuring a wide range of 
beers on tap that will cater to 

late-night customers.

Smoke’s will be located at 1300 

S. University Ave., and will have 
both patio seating and a walk-
up window. The menu includes 
a wide range of poutine options 
and even has combinations that 
vegetarian and vegan customers 
can enjoy. The franchise also 
incorporates 
an 
eco-friendly 

policy that includes compostable 
cutlery and recyclable napkins.

Both U of M poutine fanatics 

and 
first-timers 
are 
looking 

forward to the arrival of Smoke’s 
Poutinerie. Some students feel 

that it will be a nice addition 
to the city, especially after 
the sudden closure of Burger 
Fi –– kitty-corner to the new 
restaurant. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Matisen 

Douglas has never had poutine 
before, but is ready to embrace 
the franchise.

“My friends and I have been 

really sad about the lack of 
late-night foods since Burger Fi 
closed, so we’re pretty excited to 
try it out,” she wrote in a message 
to the Daily.

LSA freshman Armind Chahal 

has enjoyed poutine many times, 
though, 
and 
explained 
her 

enthusiasm for the restaurant’s 
opening.

“I have family in Canada so 

I have been to Smoke’s,” she 
said. “I’m so happy that they’re 
opening in Ann Arbor. I’m sure 
I’ll be spending lots of time 
there.”

Chahal also talked about why 

she prefers poutine to regular 
French fries when it comes to 
picking a snack.

“Poutine is just so much more 

exciting than fries alone,” she 
said. “I mean who wouldn’t want 
to have cheese and gravy on top 
of their fries? To me it’s always 
an easy decision –– poutine 
always.”

As fans of the dish, the 

co-owners, Toine Murphy and 
Joel Northam, decided to set 
up shop in Ann Arbor because 
they are both from nearby areas. 
Murphy said the choice to open 
a franchise on a college campus 
was intentional.

“Our concept is a perfect 

partnership and marriage for 
large college towns and the 
entertainment district,” he said. 
“We knew we wanted to have a 
location in Michigan, and Ann 
Arbor was the perfect fit with the 
University and the community 
–– it was almost a no-brainer.”

In a Facebook post, the owners 

played heavily on the fact that 
Smoke’s would be the first 
poutine restaurant in Ann Arbor.

“OOOH YEAH! The moment 

#poutinelovers 
have 
been 

waiting for!,” the post read. “The 
#gravytrain will have arrived. Be 
sure to round up your friends and 
come taste #poutinegreatness!”

Chahal also attested to the 

experience that she had at a 
Smoke’s Poutinerie in Canada.

“I remember really enjoying 

myself when I went there, and 
the poutine was good so that 
made everything much better,” 
she said. “I think my friends and 
I are definitely going to spend 
time at Smoke’s now that it’ll be 
in Ann Arbor.”

Murphy promised to do more 

than just the bare minimum, 
saying for him it was more than 
just a money-making venture.

“We 
know 
we 
want 
to 

really 
embrace 
the 
college 

town, basically we aren’t the 
establishment that builds four 
walls makes a product and says 
bring us your money,” he said. 
“We are that business that is 
going to be a fabric of the Ann 
Arbor community, and we are 
going to be constantly out in the 
community.”

Smoke’s Poutinerie will open 

its doors to the public on June 
4th with hours from 11 a.m. to 
11 p.m, and promises exciting 
events from June 9th-June 11th 
to further celebrate its arrival in 
Ann Arbor.

Our concept 
is a perfect 
partnership 

and marrige for 

large college 
towns and the 
entertainment 

district

Michigan in Color Contributor

Before you read on, it’s pro-

nounced like a T-S. Tsao.

My second grade teacher would 

always let me check out the advanced 
reading books, so she was pretty cool 
by my standards. But she could never 
say my name right, and that both-
ered me. No, not ‘chow,’ I would say. 
Not ‘cow,’ I would correct. She was 
an amazing teacher, but I just wished 
she would pronounce my name cor-
rectly. My name is three letters, was 
it really that hard?

One day, she came up to me while 

I was doing my multiplication.

“So I talked to Julia Yi’s father, 

and he says your last name is pro-
nounced ‘chow’,” she said in a kind of 
final way, before checking on some-
one else’s times tables.

I remember feeling … odd. I was 

seven, but I knew I was still right, 
because my mom said it a certain 
way, my dad said it the same way, 
my aunties and teachers in Chinese 
school said it the same way. I guess 
Mr. Yi probably just told her it was 
pronounced ‘chow’ so I wouldn’t 
have to keep arguing with her, but 
at the time, I knew I didn’t want it to 
be pronounced that way. And I didn’t 
know why my teacher seemed kind 
of satisfied to be right, just because 
another Asian parent told her she 
was doing fine.

It wasn’t the first time this kind 

of thing had happened. I remember 
in kindergarten, my teacher wrote 
‘CHAO’ all over my reading fold-
ers, which confused me to no end. 
I might have been a toddler, but I at 
least knew my last name was spelled 
C-A-O. I would feel uncomfortable 
about the way they spelled my name, 
even if I couldn’t figure out why. I 

didn’t like seeing that h in Cao. It just 
didn’t belong there. But it wasn’t the 
end of the world, so I just let it slide. 
I was a busy person, okay? I had let-
ters to trace. My pottery butterfly was 
only halfway finished. One ‘h’ on my 
folder wasn’t going to ruin me.

The game changed when in the 

fourth grade, I joined the elementary 
school drama club. It was exactly four 
people: me, and my three friends. 
When the teacher asked for introduc-
tions, she asked me how I pronounced 
my surname. I said it for her. Cao.

“Oh, like a T-S! Okay, got it.” 
And with that, my whole world 

changed. Like a T-S. It became the 
automatic response to answering 
many more years of pronunciation 
questions. But more than that, it 
proved one very important thing to 
me: non-Chinese people can say my 
name right. And it doesn’t take a lot of 
effort to learn it quickly.

It might not seem like a big thing, 

but when everyone treats your name 
like it’s some strange, unapproach-
able concept, it can feel alienating. I 
always felt like an other, an abnor-
mality among the “regular” names 
of the world. A burden on the teach-
ers who had to pronounce my weird, 
foreign name. Now, I know that’s not 
true. My name is not a burden — it is a 
name no lesser than any other. But for 
a long time, I avoided telling people 
my last name. I thought I didn’t need 
it. If Rihanna and Beyoncé didn’t use 
their last names, I don’t need to use it 
either, right? I know it’s different now. 
But still, when someone pronounces 
my name right, it feels a little victori-
ous. Maybe that’s why many Chinese 
parents give their children English 
names. Maybe it’s partially so that 
their children don’t have to constantly 
explain their name to everyone.

I don’t blame non-Chinese peo-

ple for not knowing how to say my 
name right away. If you grow up in 

an environment where you never 
have to learn it, how can I expect you 
to know? But if you refuse to try and 
learn it, if you laugh it off and shrug 
helplessly, or tell me how to say my 
own name, that’s where the issue 
arises. Because with globalization, 
the rise of development in countries 
around the world, and innovations 
in technology, our world is getting 
smaller. And with that, our cultures 
are interacting more and more. It’s 
just so illogical to avoid learning 
names that sound foreign to you.

My first year of college, our lecture 

was looking at a Chinese woman, Bei 
Bei Shuai, convicted of murder due to 
an attempted suicide while pregnant 
that killed her fetus (a whole other 
issue, but that’s for another time). 
Our professor skimmed over Shuai’s 
name, calling her “this woman” the 
whole time. In a lecture hall of 200 
people, our professor showed that 
you can ignore a person’s name if it 
sounds foreign, because it doesn’t 
matter. I don’t believe it was ill-inten-
tioned. But it reminded me of sec-
ond grade, of kindergarten, of every 
incident where people would sigh 
helplessly and say “I’m just not going 
to get it.” Hesitation condones igno-
rance, which in turn condones hate. 
#SayMyName was just an example of 
that. I don’t need anyone to ‘get it.’ But 
I need you to try. Because if I can try 
with all the Polish, you can make sure 
my last name sounds like a T-S in the 
beginning. If I can respect your name, 
you can respect mine.

I know I don’t have the hardest 

name in the world. I know some peo-
ple who have had to explain their first 
name and last name, who go through 
life with teachers pausing during 
attendance and recognizing confused 
silence as their name. And I know 
the hesitation isn’t meant to be mali-
cious. But the world is shrinking. 
And there is always time to learn.

I had a fanboy moment a couple 

of weeks ago. “Steven Universe” 
is one of my favorite TV shows. 
Yeah, it is a children’s cartoon, 
but it also has a good storyline 
and complex character develop-
ment in addition to its whole-
some themes of friendship. What 
got me excited, however, wasn’t a 
crazy twist or suspenseful cliff-

hanger. It was a simple side plot 
with a cultural reference.

The side plot was of one of 

the supporting characters, Lars, 
showing the other characters 
— protagonist Steven and other 
supporting character Sadie — 
how to make a dish for a potluck 
when asked what food repre-
sents him. He picked a cake. But 
it wasn’t an ordinary cake. It 
was an ube cake. Ube is a Fili-
pino word for purple yam and an 
ingredient of many popular Fili-
pino desserts. Steven and Sadie 
help Lars make the ube cake, 
rejoice with happiness because 
of cake’s delicious flavor and 
continue on with the main plot 
of intergalactic conflict.

The reference may have been 

small, but it was so powerful to 
me because of one thing: rep-

resentation. The Asian Pacific 
American community has faced 
many 
conflicts 
with 
proper 

media representation from vis-
ibility to cultural appropriation. 
I was thrilled to think of how 
many children this scene would 
reach, especially Filipinx-Amer-
ican ones. It helps fight against 
stigmas of cultural practices 
as “weird” and shows Filipinx-
American children that there are 
people of the same heritage out 
there — even in the creative arts. 
For me, media representation for 
the APA community is impor-
tant because it reinforces how 
we feel about ourselves but also 
how others perceive us. While 
visibility remains an important 
issue, it is also crucial that rep-
resentations are not toxic stereo-

typical caricatures, and I thank 
“Steven Universe” for celebrat-
ing my heritage (not to mention 
having a diverse cast including 
voice actors Deedee Magno Hall, 
Shelby Rabara and Jennifer Paz 
who have Filipino roots).

As May is Asian Pacific Amer-

ican Heritage Month, it is a 
reminder to celebrate different 
Asian Pacific heritages and to 
keep pushing outside the month 
of May. In addition to being a 
time to be self critical, it is also a 
time to learn and to listen to oth-
ers’ lived experiences. Here at 
Michigan in Color, we offer the 
stories of some APA individuals. 
We recognize the many unique 
stories that are not yet shared, so 
we encourage students of color 
to speak their truth anytime, 
anywhere.

It is a reminder to 
celebrate different 

Asian Pacific 

heritages and to keep 
pushing outside the 

month of May.

Wagner returns, Wilson leaves

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Managing Sports Editor

Competing for the first time 

since winning the Big Ten In the 
2016-17 season, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team reaped the benefits 
of 
breakout 
campaigns 
from 

sophomore forward Moritz Wagner 
and redshirt sophomore forward 
D.J. Wilson.

The pair of big men teamed up 

to punish opponents on both ends 
of the floor in a year that saw the 
Wolverines capture their first Big 
Ten Tournament title since 1998, 
claim a 2K Classic championship 
and advance to the Sweet Sixteen of 
the NCAA Tournament.

With two years of eligibility 

remaining 
at 
Michigan, 
both 

Wilson and Wagner entered the 
NBA draft in April, having garnered 
significant interest at the next level. 
But they elected not to hire agents 
in order to preserve their college 
eligibility if they decided not to 
leave the Wolverines.

Ahead of Wednesday’s 11:59 p.m. 

deadline for withdrawing their 
names from the draft or foregoing 
their remaining two years, the duo 
has chosen to go their separate 
ways, as Wagner announced his 
return to Michigan for the 2017-18 
season and Wilson announced his 
intention to remain in the draft.

Thirteen 
hours 
before 
the 

deadline, Wagner announced he 
would be coming back next season.

“I gained a great deal of 

confidence from this process and I 
have a clearer picture of what I need 
to do in order to fulfill my dreams of 

playing professionally in the NBA,” 
Wagner said. “Michigan is where 
I need to be right now, and I am 
really excited about coming back. I 
learned a lot about myself and my 
game at the (NBA) combine. I feel 
like I still have a lot to prove on this 
level and cannot wait to compete 
with my brothers for another ring.”

Three 
hours 
later, 
Wilson 

released a statement to confirm he 
would stay in the draft and end his 
college career.

“This was not an easy decision, 

however, I have thought long 
about the next step in my career 
over the last few months,” Wilson 
said. “After many prayers and 
discussions with my mom, Coach 
Beilein and the staff, it is the right 
time for me to pursue my dream of 
playing in the NBA.

“I am confident I have the drive, 

work ethic and maturity for this 
next step. It’s never going to be easy, 
but if I have learned anything at 
Michigan, perseverance pays off. It 
has truly been a blessing to have had 
the opportunity to attend Michigan, 
and I will forever be grateful to 
Coach Beilein and his staff for 
taking the chance on me. There 
are so many memories over the 
past three years that I will always 
cherish. I will be a Wolverine at 
heart forever. Go Blue!”

The two big men formed a 

formidable tandem last season, 
as Wagner emerged as a potent 
offensive threat and Wilson as a 
powerful defensive force.

Wagner averaged 12.1 points 

per game with a 39.5 shooting 
percentage from beyond the arc, 

posting five games of 20-plus points 
en route to an All-Big Ten honorable 
mention selection. Wilson led the 
team with 203 total rebounds, 
becoming 
the 
first 
Wolverine 

to record 200-plus boards since 
Mitch McGary in 2012-13, and 57 
blocks, the most in nine seasons for 
Michigan.

Throughout the draft process, 

including participating in the NBA 
combine in Chicago from May 9-14, 
Wilson and Wagner received a wide 
variety of projections. According 
to Michigan coach John Beilein, 
Wagner learned that he needed 
more time to develop at the college 
level.

“Moe had an extraordinary 

experience 
with 
this 
process, 

one that opened his eyes to 
what he needs to do next for 
his development,” Beilein said. 
“Moe loves Michigan, and he is 
excited about becoming a leader 
on next year’s team. His incredible 
personality 
and 
enthusiastic 

demeanor is a great plus for this 
team and his brilliant future. We 
are so pleased to be part of that and 
his journey moving forward.”

Meanwhile, Beilein said Wilson 

learned that he had enough reason 
to turn professional.

“D.J. and our coaching staff 

worked very hard over the last 
month to get as much information 
as possible on his draft status,” 
Beilein said, “Given the data and 
insight we received, D.J. is confident 
he is ready to take the next step in 
his basketball career. We love D.J. 
and he will always be a Michigan 
Wolverine. 
His 
development 

over the past three seasons, and 
particularly this past season, was 
phenomenal.

“With continued work, he shows 

great potential to improve in a 
similar manner in the NBA. We 
wish him and his family the very 
best and we will always be rooting 
for him during this draft process 
and for all the years to come.”

The news comes a day after 

Michigan announced that guard 
Jaaron 
Simmons, 
an 
All-Mid-

American Conference first team 
selection at Ohio University, will 
join the Wolverines next season as 
a graduate transfer. Michigan will 
benefit from his veteran presence 
after losing forward Mark Donnal 
and guard Andrew Dakich as 
graduate transfers to Clemson and 
Quinnipiac University, respectively.

Though the Wolverines will 

face the heavy burden of replacing 
Wilson next year, the return of 
Wagner, as well as the addition of 
Simmons, will undoubtedly soften 
the blow.

Michigan’s season ends 
at Washington Regional

By ROHAN KUMAR

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s golf team’s 

season came to a premature end 
during the NCAA Washington 
Regional 
last 
week, 
as 
the 

Wolverines shot 886 (292-298-
296) to finish in 10th place, 
missing the top-five finish needed 
to advance to Nationals. Southern 
California 
clinched 
first, 
37 

strokes ahead of Michigan.

Junior Kyle Mueller shot a 212 

(71-71-70) to finish tied for eighth 
place, but came up one stroke 
shy of forcing a playoff to go to 
Nationals as an individual.

The Wolverines had stellar play 

in the first round spearheaded by 
Mueller, sophomore Nick Carlson 
and senior Bryce Evon. All three 
were in the top 15 after day one 
of the tournament. Carlson’s first 
round score of 68 put him in a tie 
for third while Evon carded a 69 
and was tied for sixth.

The duo gave up crucial strokes 

during days two and three, 
causing them to move down 
the leaderboard. They finished 
tied for 17th and tied for 34th, 
respectively.

Mueller had the third-best 

score for Michigan in the opening 
round and was initially tied for 
14th. His game showed to be more 
consistent than his teammates, 
though, as he moved up the 
leaderboard for the remaining 
rounds.

Despite the steady play from 

Mueller, Carlson and Evon, the 
Wolverines lack of depth led to 
their demis. Senior Tom Swanson 
and junior Ian Kim also started 
for Michigan, and finished 69th 
and 75th out of the 75-player field.

“We had good golf going on in 

every round, it was just a question 
of whether we had enough guys 
doing it,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten. “We knew to 
advance it was gonna take all five 
guys playing good golf and (we) 
just weren’t consistent enough.”

The 
Wolverines 
had 
a 

successful season with six top-
three finishes, including two 
tournament wins. They won the 
Dayton Flyer Invitational back in 
October and the Desert Mountain 
Intercollegiate in March.

“The 
season 
overall 
was 

another step in the right direction 
for us. We had two tournament 
wins out of 12 events, which is 
the first time we’ve done that 
since I’ve been the head coach,” 
Whitten said. “I think when we 
add up all the numbers at the end, 
our season scoring average for the 
year is either gonna be the lowest 
in the history of the program or 
very close to it.”

This tournament marked the 

last event under Michigan for 
Evon and Swanson, who will 
not be with the team next year. 
Senior Reed Hrynewich is also 
leaving, but did not compete in 
Washington. Carlson and Mueller 
will both return and Whitten 
expects them to lead the team.

“We got Nick Carlson and 

Kyle Mueller returning who have 
both played really high-level 
events and should have a lot of 
confidence,” Whitten said. “They 
go to every tournament trying 
to win and they’re just trying to 
refine really small parts of their 
game like shots around the green 
or ball striking consistency.”

Kim, along with freshmen 

Brent Ito and Taisei Negishi, will 
also be coming back. Neither Ito 
nor Negishi saw much tournament 
action this season.

The Wolverines will be gaining 

three players by next season, 
including 
two 
international 

players — Connor Prassas of 
Illinois, Charlie Pilon of Australia 
and Henry Spring of New Zealand 
will all join the upcoming roster.

“We are gonna have three 

new players on the team next 
year,” Whitten said. “When you 
replace three out of eight guys the 
chemistry of the team is gonna 
be a little different, and they will 
have a different feel next year.”

Michigan will be searching for 

consistency as it starts its 2017-18 
season in September, but Whitten 
was still proud of his team’s 
results from the past year.

“(I 
am) 
disappointed 
that 

we didn’t get to go to Nationals 
because I would have loved to 
see the guys compete there, 
but overall I think it was a good 
season,” Whitten said. “We are 
still kind of thinking about today, 
but I am excited to get the new 
guys here and start building 
again.”

‘M’ stunned by Northwestern, 6-4

By JACOB SHAMES

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Ninth inning, bases loaded, no outs.
The Michigan baseball team faced 

a similar situation in its regular-
season finale last Saturday against 
Michigan State. With the game tied 
at one in the bottom of the ninth, 
redshirt junior right-hander Jackson 
Lamb recorded three straight outs to 
escape the jam, and the Wolverines 
eventually defeated the Spartans, 2-1, 
in 10 innings.

In its Big Ten Tournament opener 

against Northwestern Wednesday, 
Michigan wasn’t as fortunate. Down 
4-3, the seventh-seeded Wildcats (24-
28 overall, 13-11 Big Ten) plated three 
runs in the top of the ninth against 
Lamb and sophomore left-hander 
William Tribucher to earn a come-
from-behind, 6-4 upset win against 
the second-seeded Wolverines.

The loss was a shocking turn for 

Michigan (42-14, 16-8), beyond the 
the unexpected nature of a No. 7 seed 
defeating a No. 2 seed. Wednesday’s 
contest marked just the third time 
this season the Wolverines had lost 
a game in which they held a ninth-
inning lead. Also, the three earned 
runs Lamb gave up were the first 
three he had surrendered all season in 
28 innings. 

Junior right-hander Ryan Nutof 

came out firing for the Wolverines, 
hammering the strike zone with 
his mid-90s fastball in the first and 
second inning. At first, Northwestern 
had no answer — the Wildcats struck 
out three times in their first five 
at-bats. But they were soon able to 
pick up on Nutof’s approach: First 
baseman Connor Lind sat on a Nutof 
fastball and homered to right to give 
Northwestern a 1-0 lead in the second 
inning.

However, Michigan was unfazed. 

Two-out rallies have been a staple 
for the Wolverines this season, and 
this continued in the second inning. 
Junior first baseman Jake Bivens 
drove a double down the left-field 
line, and sophomore designated hitter 
Nick Poirier slapped an RBI single 
into centerfield to tie the game.

After adjusting to Nutof’s velocity, 

the Wildcats continued to make 
strong contact — their next four 
at-bats consisted of a double, a hard 
line-drive out to end the second, a 
single and a two-run bomb by second 
baseman Alex Erro in the third 
inning. But Nutof responded with 
his secondary arsenal, recording four 
strikeouts via off-speed pitch in the 
third and fourth innings.

“Northwestern’s a good fastball 

hitting team. They ambush the 
fastball,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “Nutof has a good fastball, but 
they were ready for it after the first 
inning. ” 

Michigan responded again in the 

bottom half of the third inning. Senior 
centerfielder Johnny Slater took the 
first pitch he saw from left-hander 
Cooper Wetherbee and parked a shot 
to deep right field to cut the deficit in 
half.

The Wolverines took their first, 

and only, lead in the fifth inning. 
Sophomore right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann ripped a double to the 
gap in left field to lead off. He later 
advanced to third on a textbook 
bunt from senior catcher Harrison 
Wenson, and sophomore second 
baseman Ako Thomas knotted the 
score with a double down the left-field 
line. A passed ball allowed Thomas 
to move to third, and he scored when 
Northwestern catcher Jack Claeys’s 
throw flew past the base and into the 
outfield.

With his entire array of pitches 

established, Nutof was dominant. He 
hurled a career-best 10 strikeouts, and 
retired nine straight batters during 
one span from the fourth to seventh 
innings before he was relieved by 
senior right-hander Mac Lozer after a 
one-out double ended that streak.

That lead may have been only one 

run, but it was a lead that Michigan 
felt fully confident in, especially with 
two relievers that sported perfect 
earned-run averages coming into the 
game. Lozer stranded the runner at 
second with two strikeouts in the 
seventh, and left another runner at 
second to keep the Wildcats off the 
board.

Lamb then took the mound in 

the ninth, but from the first batter, 
it was clear that he wasn’t nearly 
as sharp as usual — according to 
Bakich, his shoulder soreness leading 
up to Wednesday played a role. He 
surrendered two consecutive singles 
and a four-pitch walk to load the 
bases, and also threw a wild pitch. 
Tribucher 
attempted 
to 
salvage 

the situation, but to no avail — 
Northwestern hit two more singles to 
drive home three runs.

The 
Wolverines 
won’t 
have 

much time to move on from their 
surprising defeat, as they’ll face No. 
6-seed Indiana at 10 a.m. Thursday 
in an elimination game. Michigan 
has been a “bounce-back team” all 
season long — the Wolverines have 
lost consecutive games just once this 
season — but the confidence that 
comes with this will be tested once 
again.

“We’re excited for tomorrow,” 

Brdar said. “We gotta stick with what 
we’re doing, stick with our approach 
— pitching, good defense and timely 
hitting, and tomorrow should be a 
different outcome.”

Ninth-inning woes cost Michigan 

BASEBALL

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY

Daily Sports Writer

It 
appeared 
the 
second-

seeded Michigan baseball team 
would squeak out a win against 
seventh-seeded Northwestern in 
its opening game of the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
The 
Wolverines 

led, 4-3, heading into the ninth 
inning, and go-to closer senior 
right-hander Jackson Lamb was 
on the bump. 

Coming 
into 
the 
contest, 

Lamb had a 0.00 earned-run 
average and had allowed just 
18 hits through 28.0 innings 
pitched. Michigan expected the 
same Lamb that had closed out 
nearly every game this season 
— but the Lamb that showed up 
Wednesday was much different. 

Wildcat first baseman Jack 

Claeys walked up to the plate in 
the lead-off slot and knocked the 
3-2 pitch through the first and 
second base gap. With the tying 
run on first base, Northwestern 
opted to replace Claeys with a 
pinch runner. Lamb had been in 
tough situations before, but with 
the steady stream of rain and a 
man on first, he threw just his 
second wild pitch of the season 
and the Wildcats advanced to 
second. 

With 
a 
man 
in 
scoring 

position, third baseman Connor 
Lind crushed a line drive over 
a leaping sophomore second 
baseman Ako Thomas. Michigan 
managed to hold both runners on 
the corners, but if Lamb wasn’t 
shaky before, his confidence had 
to have been dwindling. 

It was clear Lamb wasn’t 

himself when he walked the next 
batter in four straight pitches. 

The walk forced Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich to bring in 
sophomore right-hander William 
Tribucher to try and clean up 
Lamb’s mess — a tall task. The 
bases were loaded with no outs. 

Right-fielder 
Ben 
Dickey 

hadn’t managed a hit all day, but 
picked up his first in the ninth 
inning when he singled through 
the Wolverine third baseman and 
shortstop. It wasn’t necessarily 
hard hit, but it was perfectly 
placed and just out of reach for 
senior shortstop Michael Brdar. 
The hit was enough to score one 
run and tie the game, 4-4. 

The first out of the inning 

came at the hands of Brdar after 
he slightly bobbled the ball but 
managed to flick the ball with 

the tip of his glove to junior third 
baseman Drew Lugbauer. While 
the go-ahead run crossed the 
plate, it was an impressive move 
from Brdar that minimized the 
damage. 

With one away and men on 

first and second, the inning was 
far from over and Northwestern 
had the momentum in their 
favor. Second baseman Alex Erro 
crushed a single up the middle 
passed a diving Thomas to score 
another run. 

Fortunately 
for 
Michigan, 

Tribucher caught shortstop Jack 
Dunn looking for the crucial 
second out. An easy groundout 
would end the frame, but instead 
of celebrating, the Wolverines 
had some work to do. 

The bottom of the ninth inning 

found junior first baseman Jake 
Bivens in the leadoff spot. He 
was hit by the second pitch he 
saw, bringing the tying run to 
the plate. Already having picked 
up a run batted-in in the second 
inning, designated hitter Nick 
Poirier smacked a line drive to 
second base. It was similar to 
the one Michigan had seen in 
the top of the inning, except 
Northwestern was able to catch 
it. 

With 
one 
out, 
sophomore 

right-fielder 
Jonathan 

Engelmann skied the 1-2 pitch 
and after the Wildcat shortstop 
backed up to the grass, he easily 
made the catch for the second 
out.

The final out came at the 

hands of senior catcher Harrison 
Wenson. Currently batting .191 
— the lowest of the starters — 
he’s not the ideal choice to be in 
this position. But he is one of the 
few Wolverine players who has 
the ability to hit the long ball, 
something Michigan desperately 
needed. 

But it wasn’t in the cards for 

the Wolverines as Wenson struck 
out swinging in three pitches.

It was a rare — and crucial — 

mishap from Michigan’s bullpen. 
Now, the Wolverines will need 
to win five straight games to 
capture the Big Ten Tournament 
title.

“50-some games where we’ve 

been pretty consistent (in the 
ninth inning) so I just look at this 
as a fluke, just a speed bump,” 
Bakich said. “Our guys have 
responded every time they’ve 
been knocked down all season 
and they’ll respond tomorrow.”

Senior Megan Betsa was a constant for the Wolverines this season, boasting a career season and supporting an offense that regressed after Sierra Romero’s departure.
Season in Review: Softball looks to future

By MAX MARCOVITCH 

Daily Sports Writer

With a 4-2 loss to Washington 

in 
the 
Regional 
round, 
the 

Michigan softball team bowed out 
of the NCAA Tournament, and 
thus waved goodbye to the 2017 
season. It was, at times, a season 
and team unable to escape the 
shadow of the 2016 juggernaut; a 
year in which “tight” might well 
have been Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins’ most used word. The loss 
to Washington marked the earliest 
exit for the program since 2011. But 
in a year that will likely be seen as 
a “down” year for the program that 
has been to 12 Women’s College 
World Series, the Wolverines were 
still ranked the entire season, were 
comfortably the second best team 
in the conference and finished 
43-13-1.

The Daily looks back on a 

season seemingly brimming with 
potential, but ultimately plagued 
by inconsistency.

Most valuable player: Megan 

Betsa

This award undoubtedly belongs 

to the pitcher who led the country 
in strikeouts, and was a model 
of stability all year, even when 
the offense wasn’t. Coming off 
lingering injuries that forced her 
to sit out of fall training, senior 
right-hander Megan Betsa came 
through with the best season of her 

decorated career. Betsa had career 
bests across the board, including 
innings pitched (235.1), batting 
average against (.148) and strikeout-
to-walk ratio (4.12). With newfound 
confidence, Betsa especially found 
her groove in the Big Ten portion 
of the schedule, including a streak 
of 48 consecutive scoreless innings 
in the heart of conference play en 
route to unanimously being voted 
first-team all-Big Ten. In mid-
March, she threw two no-hitters 
in the span of one week, prompting 
Hutchins to say that Betsa was 
“really been the best I’ve seen her 
in her career over this period.”

Betsa pitched in 23 games this 

season that her team failed to 
score more than four runs. She 
still won or saved 13 of them. The 
senior was a stabilizing force 
all year — the glue that kept her 
team from unraveling when it 
appeared imminent, making her 
the unquestionable MVP. 

Breakout 
Player: 
Faith 

Canfield

It was hardly surprising to 

see sophomore second baseman 
Faith Canfield come through with 
a home run in the first inning 
of the elimination game against 
Washington; she’s been hitting 
the ball hard all season. Canfield 
was appointed the starting second 
baseman early in the season, with 
massive shoes to fill on the heels 
of Sierra Romero’s graduation. 

Romero might well be the best 
Michigan softball player in history, 
and while Canfield may never 
reach that level, she proved herself 
a worthy heir to Romero’s throne, 
consistenly producing all season 
long.

Canfield’s breakout year truly 

became evident when she began to 
flash newfound power. Coming off 
a year in which she had seven extra-
base knocks all year, Canfield tied 
junior first baseman Aidan Falk 
for the team lead in that category 
in 2017 with 27. With a steady 
glove and rock-solid bat, Canfield 
was one of just two Wolverines to 
start all 57 games for Michigan this 
season — a testament to Hutchins’ 
confidence in her. Canfield will 
continue to be a reliable middle-of-
the-order bat in the years to come, 
and is an early candidate for 2018 
Big Ten Player of the Year.

Most 
important 
game: 

Michigan State 5, Michigan 4 in 
Big Ten Tournament

It wasn’t nearly the “most 

important 
game” 
that 
the 

Wolverines were hoping for, but it 
certainly was the moment where 
Michigan’s season began to spiral 
out of control — a moment the 
players simply couldn’t bounce 
back from. After crawling back 
on their own home field to 
grab a 4-2 lead in the Big Ten 
Tournament quarterfinals, Betsa 
allowed the Spartans to score 

three unanswered runs. Michigan 
State centerfielder Lea Foerster 
reached base four times on the day, 
including a crucial RBI single in 
the top of the seventh inning.

It’s hard to overstate how much 

this loss stung for the Wolverines; 
in a tournament circled on their 
calendar all year in front of their 
home fans, they lost to an in-state 
rival before even reaching the 
semifinal. The loss eliminated 
any hope of returning home for a 
Regional at Alumni Field. Instead, 
Michigan fell outside the top-16 
and was forced to travel to Seattle, 
with the faint — and ultimately 
misguided — hope of upending the 
host Washington. 

Up next:
Michigan will lose one of the 

most accomplished senior classes 
in school history, perhaps no loss 
with more implications than that of 
Betsa. The Wolverines will count 
on senior right-hander Tera Blanco 
in both the circle and the lineup as 
the new face of the program, with 
senior Aidan Falk also figuring to 
be a vital middle-of-the-order bat. 
But the core of this team will likely 
be the rising junior class — led by 
Canfield, Peters and Alexander. 
The trio alone accounted for 157 
hits in 2017. Rising sophomore 
shortstop Madison Uden flashed 
potential in her 24 appearances 
this season, carving out a role 
that made her a regular starter by 

season’s end. 

For the first time in years, the 

team will come into the season with 
questions throughout the pitching 
rotation. Blanco appears capable of 
taking the step toward becoming 
an ace, but rising sophomore right-
hander Leah Crockett pitched 
just 6.1 innings in 2017. The 
coaching staff is optimistic about 
incoming 
freshman 
left-hander 

Megan Beaubien, who comes in as 
the No. 6 overall prospect in the 
2017 recruiting class, according 
to FloSoftball. But it’s fair to 
question whether Hutchins and 
her coaching staff will immediately 
rely upon the incoming freshman 
for 120+ innings out of the gate. 
Michigan looks poised to juggle a 
three-person rotation, at least in 
the early portion of the season.

Overall, it will be a talented, 

if comparatively unproven, team 
coming into the year. It won’t have 
the same burden of the shadow of 
expectation that this team seemed 
to fall victim to all too often. 
Quite a bit hinges on Blanco and 
Beaubien being able to fill the void 
left by Betsa, and whether Canfield, 
Peters and Uden can take steps to 
become the superstars they have 
shown signs of becoming. The 
Wolverines will likely remain as a 
preseason top-15 team, granted the 
benefit of the doubt that Hutchins’ 
teams have earned throughout her 
illustrious career.
