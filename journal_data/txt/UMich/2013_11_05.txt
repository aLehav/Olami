CFE director's role expanded

Schnieder saved
driver from major
terrorism charges
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Harry Schneider, a lawyer
at Seattle-based Perkins Coie,
spoke to a group of over 100
people Monday afternoon as part
of The International Law Work-
shop.
Schneider talked about his
involvement in the case of Salim
Ahmed Hamdan, who was a
driver for Osama bin Laden, and
as a result was accused of engag-
ing in acts of terrorism against
the United States. Hamad was
detained by the United States for
nearly eight years before he won
his case.
Though he faced serious
charges of assisting one of
the most wanted criminals in
American history, Hammad
was only found guilty of materi-
ally supporting bin Ladin, after'
arguments from a legal team
that included Schneider, court-
appointed lawyer Lt. Command-
er Charles Swift, Georgetown
University Law Prof. Neal Katyal
and others from Perkins Coie.
Hamdan was first apprehend-

ed on Nov. 24, 2001 after drop-
ping his daughter and pregnant
wife off at the Pakistan boarder.
His second daughter was born
while he was detained, and he
didn't meet her until he was
released years later.
During his-time as a detainee,
he was subject to harsh interro-
gation, including sexual humili-
ation and sleep deprivation.
He was imprisoned in several
facilities, including the notorious
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in
Cuba.
Hamdan was born in Yemen
and orphaned at an early age. He
was not extensively educated.
Schneider said Hamdan's job
offer from bin Laden offered a
drastically different standard of
living than he could have expect-
ed otherwise.
"He was told that if he stayed
in Afghanistan, he could work
and earn ten times the money
he could ever hope to earn in
Yemen," Schneider said.
Hamdan was first employed
by bin Laden in 1996 to trans-
port agricultural workers who
worked on bin Laden's farm.
Eventually, Hamdan became the
al-Qaida leader's personal driv-
er. Although Hamdan was not
unaware of bin Laden's activities,
he wasn't a central figure to his

A common language

Milka Eliav is a Hebrew lec-
turer for the Near Eastern Studies
Department and has worked at the
University since 2000.
How did you end up
at the University?
I followed my husband's aca-
demic path. We had a lot of stops
- a stop in Princeton, in New.
York City, back to Israel and Ann
Arbor. I had not taught at a uni-
versity before Ann Arbor, so these
are the only students I know, and
they're awesome. They are usu-
ally very smart, sometimes too
stressed about grades, but other
than that pretty cool.

How do you approachteach- people and talking.
ing a foreign language?

I try to make it about the stu-
dents, so I try to bring up topics
that the students relate to. For
example, I teach Hebrew, so if I
am teaching the verb "to drink,"
I won't be afraid to say 'do you
drink at parties?' The students
will giggle, and it creates sparks
and makes them a lot more
engaged. Or, if I am teaching the
word "roommate," we can gossip
about students' roommates, and
then we use the language. Essen-
tially, the goal is to use the lan-
guage. I make an effort to use the
language through the students'
experiences. Really, I just like

What is your favorite spot
in Ann Arbor?
I like the park - any park or,
playground. I have a little kid,
and the parks are beautiful. I also
love State Street during the Ann
Arbor Art Fair in July. Students
are not here then, so they don't
know about it. During Art Fair,
Ann Arbor comes to life. There
is no parking anywhere, and lots
of people in line and outside. I
like that because I miss a big city
sometimes.

Gay rights bill tackles
obstacle in U.S. Senate

Bill on employee
discrimination faces
tough road in House
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate pushed a major anti-bias
gay rights bill past a first, big
hurdle Monday, a clear sign of
Americans' greater acceptance
of homosexuality nearly two
decades after the law prohibit-
ing federal recognition of same-
sex marriage.
The vote of 61-30 essentially
ensured that the Senate has the
votes to pass the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act that
would prohibit workplace dis-
crimination against gay, bisex-
ual and transgender Americans.
Final passage, possibly by
week's end, would cap a 17-year
quest to secure Senate support
for a similar discrimination
measure that failed by one vote
in 1996, the same year Congress
passed and President Bill Clin-
ton signed the Defense of Mar-
riage Act.
Reflecting the nation's shift-
ing views toward gay rights
and the fast-changing political
dynamic, seven Senate Republi-
cans joined with 54 Democrats
to vote to move ahead on the leg-
islation.
"Rights are sometimes intan-
gible but, boy if you've ever been
discriminated against, seek-
ing employment or seeking an
advancement, it's bitter," Sen.
Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the
only openly gay member of the
Senate, said after the vote. "And
it's been a long, long fight, but
I think its day has come. And
that's just very exciting to wit-
ness."
The legislation would be the
first significant gay rights legis-
lation since Congress ended the
ban on gays serving openly in the
military in December 2010. The
Supreme Court in June affirmed
gay marriage and granted fed-
eral benefits to legally married
same-sex couples while same-

sex marriage is legal in 14 states
and the District of Columbia.
About a half hour after the
Senate acted, President Barack
Obama cited the vote as anexam-
ple of "common sense startingto
prevail" in a Congress that has
opposed much of his agenda.
"Inexorably, the idea of a more
tolerant, more prosperous coun-
try that offers more opportunity
to more people, that's an idea
that the vast majority-of Ameri-
cans believe in," the president
told a group of supporters gath-
ered for a summit in Washington
Monday night. I
Prospects are dimmer in the
Republican-led House where
Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio,
remains opposed.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,
a chief sponsor of the legislation,
said the 60-plus bipartisan vote
should force the House to vote
on the legislation.
"It was Republican votes that
made the difference tonight and
that that is a strong signal," Col-
lins aid. "I also think that atti-
tudes are changing very rapidly
on gay rights issues and we're
seeing that with each passing
day. More and more people have
embraced equality."
The vote served as a vivid
reminder of the nation's chang-
ing views and lingering resis-
tance to homosexuality. The
political implications resonated
in Maine, as six-term Demo-
cratic Rep. Mike Michaud, who
is running for governor, said he
was gay and questioned whether
it still mattered to voters.
In high drama for the Sen-
ate, the typical 15-minute vote
stretched beyond 30 minutes of
waiting and cajoling.
Two backers of the measure
- Sens. Claire McCaskill of Mis-
souri and Lisa Murkowski of
Alaska - were on planes back to
Washington. That left sponsors
stuck at 58 of the necessary 60
votes, forcing Collins and Jeff
Merkley, D-Ore., to lobby fierce-
ly, sometimes at the door of the
Republican cloakroom off the

Senate floor.
Minutes into the vote, Sen.
Kelly Ayotte of New Hamp-
shire emerged to vote yes. Then
the outcome rested with Sens.
Rob Portman of Ohio, who
announced earlier this year that
his son was gay and he support-
ed same-sex marriage, and Sen.
Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.
After extended discussions,
Portman and Toomey emerged
to vote yes.
"I have long believed that
more legal protections are
appropriate to prevent employ-
ment discrimination based on
sexual orientation," Toomey
said in a statement after the vote,
in which he promised to offer an
amendment to protect religious
freedom.
The other Republicans who
voted yes were Sens. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, who had opposed
the discrimination measure in
1996, Dean Heller of Nevada,
and Mark Kirk of Illinois.,
Kirk delivered his first speech
on the Senate floor since suf-
fering a stroke in January 2012:
Seated at a desk, Kirk said it was
especially important for an Illi-
nois Republican to speak out for
the legislation in the tradition of
Everett Dirksen and Abraham
Lincoln, two leaders on civil
rights.
The three potential Repub-
lican presidential candidates
- Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted
Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul
of Kentucky - voted against, a
reflection that among core GOP
conservative voters opposition
to gay rights remains strong. No
senator spoke in opposition to
the measure during Monday's
debate.
Tony Perkins of the conser-
vative Family Research Coun-
cil said in a statement that he
was disappointed in the Senate
vote, but "confident that the
U.S. House of Representatives
will ultimately reject ENDA
because it not only threatens
the free market but religious
liberties as well."

Traverse City Mayor Michael
Estes has pleaded guilty to a mis-

impaired.
The Traverse City Record-

in district court on Monday, less
than two weeks after his arrest
on a drunken driving count. He
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.
The 63-year-old mayor was
pulled over Oct. 23 after a candi-

pickup truck weaving across turn
and bike lanes on a downtown
street. A breath test recorded a
blood-alcohol content of 0.12 per-

legal limit for driving.

BAGHDAD
Double suicide

* attacks kill 12
A double suicide bombing and
other attacks killed 12 people in
Iraq on Monday, said officials,
while Iraqi legislators passed a
law laying the groundwork for
next year's parliamentary elec-
tions.
Violence has spiked in Iraq
since April, with the pace of kill-
ing reaching levels unseen since
2008. U.N. figures released last
week showed that at least 979 peo-
ple, mostly civilians, were killed
last month alone.
The latest attacks came two
days after Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki returned from a trip to
Washington in which he sought
assistance fightingthe insurgency,
including weapons and help with
intelligence.
President Barack Obama
pledged Friday to help combat an
increasingly active al-Qaida in
Iraqbutstoppedshortofannounc-
ingnew commitments of the assis-
tance al-Maliki sought.

terroristic acts.
During the trial, it was deter-
mined that President George
W. Bush had overstepped his
constitutional authority by fail-
ing to formally charge Ham-
mad for two years after he was
apprehended and violating

detainment rules of the Geneva
Convention.
On Feb. 7, 2002, Bush decided
that the Geneva Conventions
would not apply to detainees cap-
tured in the conflict in Afghani-
stan. Schneider pointed out the
irony of this, as the United States
had been a major player in secur-
ing the rights of war prisoners at
Geneva in 1949.
Schneider said he suspects
the U.S. government waited to

charge him so could build a case
against him.
"There was no upside in pro-
ceeding before they were ready,"
he said.
These unusual and controver-
sial factors made the victory that
much sweeter, Schneider said.
Seven years after being appre-
hended, Hamdan was finally
released in January 2009.
"It was pretty close to the best
thing that could have happened."

PROTESTED

day where volunteers made 600
phone calls to the John Bry-
ant, CEO of Kellogg Company,
to break their partnership with
Wilmar. Kellogg, based in Bat-
tle Creek, Mich., is known for
producing cereals like Frosted
Flakes and Rice Krispies. It
also owns several major snack
brands, including Cheez-it, Pop
Tarts and Pringles.
On Nov. 20, Forest Heroes
will travel to Kellogg's Battle
Creek headquarters to protest
against the companies relation-
ship with Wilmar. Kellogg is one
of the palm oil supplier's biggest
customers.
Eva Resnick-Day, campaign

organizer of Ann Arbor's section
of Forest Heroes, said the orga-
nization is recruiting students
to get involved in efforts to pres-
sure Kellogg to break its part-
nership. She said the group is
also petitioning in several areas
around Ann Arbor, including
the Ann Arbor Farmer's Market.
The campaign's online petition
has over 150,000 signatures.
Resnick-Day said it is possible
to produce deforestation-free
palm oil, as corporations such as
Nestle have done in the past.
Public Policy senior Alex
Leader, a member of Forest
Heroes, said if Kellogg breaks
ties with Wilmar, the event
would have a "tipping-point
effect." And if Wilmar becomes
a more sustainable corporation,
other corporations will follow
their example, he said.

through our state and nation."
Zurbuchen's main duties will
involve constructing an entre-
preneurial curriculum that will
benefit all 19 schools and colleg-
es, including a minor available
to all students in fall 2014. The
goal is to increase opportunities

for students - especially in the
smaller schools and colleges -
meshing co-curricular and aca-
demic programs.
Today, the University offers
more than 40 entrepreneurial
programs concentrated within
the Business School and the
College of Engineering. There
are also student-led endeav-
ors, such as MPowered's 1,000
Pitches program, which attracts
thousands of participants every

year.
The administration has
emphasized entrepreneurship
outside of the business and
engineering schools this year
with the creation of several pro-
grams, such as the Law School's
Entrepreneurship Clinic, which
advises students in any college
about the common start-up legal
issues, from intellectual proper-
ty laws to drafting finance docu-
ments.



RENOVATIONS
From Page 1
really the center of their social
life and political life."
The Halfway Inn, a concert
space known among students as
"the Half-ass," was one of the
major parts of East Quad and was
eliminated during renovations,
sparking discontent among some
students.
"That was a huge central
aspect of the East Quad com-
munity, and they actually took it
away in the renovation, and a lot
of people were really, really upset
about that," Levine said.
Joellyn Plasterer, a sophomore
inthe Residential Collegeadmits
that students living in East Quad
have experienced a loss of com-
munity during this transitional
period for the RC, which was
relocated to West Quad Resi-
dence Hall duringconstruction.
"Half of us in the RC didn't
have that sense of community, so
we don't even know how to fos-
ter it. We don't know what the
RC was before," Plasterer said,
"People will tell us it was bet-
ter, but how do you fix that? The
administrators are trying really
hard, but I think the community
is suffering."
Having lived in East Quad
both before renovations and
after, Madeline Higgins, an RC
junior and East Quad resident
adviser, said she had a very posi-
tive experience living in the old

East Quad.
"It was a blast. The commu-
nity was just really great. There
was a lot of art work on the walls
- murals and stuff; it just had a
great personality," she said.
Higgins added that her expe-
rience with the new East Quad
has been similarly positive thus
far.
"Coming back from West
Quad has been a great experi-
ence; everybody is a lot more
open here, especially because of
the layout of the building," Hig-
gins said.
Though students complain
about how the RC has changed
with the renovation of East
Quad, Levine sees the changes as
"complicated."
"The new building definitely
matches the University's goals
for the future, andI think there
were a lot of problems with the
old building, like structurally
and health-code wise, for sure,"
Levine said. "But I definitely
think that the building itself was
a point of similarity between
people from the RC from dif-
ferent generations; people came
together around that, and there
is a lot lost there even though it
had to happen."
The dining hall has been a
source of frustration for students
actually living in East Quad. Stu-
dents from other dorms choose
to eat there frequently and crowd
the room, as South Quad dining
hall is closed this year for con-
struction.
Peter Logan, the director of

communications for University
Housing, said in comparison to
other dining halls, East Quad
provides more options for veg-
etarian and vegan students, more
local foods - all meat and poul-
try at East Quad is local - and
made-to-order food:
However, Plasterer mentions
overcrowding and the general
time-consuming nature of eat-
ing in the East Quad dining hall
affect her and other residents on
a daily basis.
Students are still adjusting to
this new dining experience, and
are finding ways to cope with the
crowds.
"We aren't restoring residence
halls to be what they were or to
meet expectations of those who
used to live there," Logan said,
"We are renovating them for
the contemporary and emerging
needs of current and future stu-
dents."
The post-renovation East
Quad, Plasterer said, almost
feels like a hotel. Things are very
clean, modern and nice, but it
doesn't always feel like home.
But Plasterer and other students
are also excited to see what East
Quad becomes.
"I think it is kind of cool that
we have this opportunity to put
our unique imprint on this build-
ing." Higgins said.
"East Quad was definitely
home to both students and facul-
ty before the renovation," Levine
said, "Maybe it will become that
for a new generation again, but
this building was really special."

He said many neighborhoods
where students live are mag-
nets for crime.
"I'd like to see our police
department and the University
Police cooperate on crimes" he
said. "We need to work togeth-

Eaton also plans to strength-

en the relationship between
the University and the city.
He believes believing that
increased discussions between
the administration and the city
will create a more transparent
environment. He added that a
lack of communication often
results in citizens' not having

an example.

Ousted leader Morsi defiant in
early stages of long-awaited trial

Former president
questioned
legitimacy of court,
refuses jumpsuit
CAIRO (AP) - Ousted Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi refused
to wear a prison jumpsuit, enter-
ing the caged dock in a dark
business suit as his co-defen-
dants applauded. He defiantly
questioned the legitimacy of the
court and proclaimed himself
still Egypt's leader. His fellow
Muslim Brotherhood members
chanted, "Down with military
rule!"
Morsi's long-awaited trial
got off to a chaotic start Mon-
day, with outbursts and inter-
ruptions, and it was quickly
adjourned until Jan.8.
The dramatic first public
appearance for Morsi since
the July 3 military coup that
removed him from power was
meant to be a step toward due
process. Instead, it highlighted
the challenges facing Egypt's
interim authorities as they
attempt to close a chapter of his
presidency, while his Islamist
supporters seek to disrupt the
effort.
Morsi and 14 co-defendants
- seven of whom are still at
large - are charged with incit-
ing the killing of protesters
who massed outside the presi-
dential palace in December
2012 and demanded that he
call off a referendum on a new
Islamist-drafted constitution.
Brotherhood members attacked
a sit-in by the protesters, spark-
ing clashes that left 10 people
dead.
Before Monday's session

began, silent video broadcast on
state TV showed Morsi arriving
in a minibus outside the make-
shift courtroom at a police acad-
emy in eastern Cairo. He wore
the dark suit, light shirt and no
tie, flanked by burly policemen.
A smiling Morsi later walked
into the cage in the court -
still in the same garb, unlike
his co-defendants in white
prison jumpsuits. They stood
in two lines like a presidential
honor guard, applauding and
raising their hands in a four-
fingered gesture - commem-
orating the hundreds of his
supporters killed when secu-
rity forces moved to clear pro-
test encampments in August.
Another defendant - an aide
held with him in the secret
military location - also was in
a suit.
Feisty and healthy-looking
after four months of secret
detention, the '62-year-old
Morsi immediately started talk-
ing even before Judge Ahmed
Sabry Youssef gave him the
floor.
"What is going on now is a
cover for a military coup," Morsi
shouted in a voice that echoed
through the courtroom. "I warn
everybody. ... I wish that the
Egyptian judiciary would not
become one day a cover for the
military coup."
The defense lawyers clapped.
Chants from his fellow defen-
dants followed: "Down, down
with military rule!"
Yousseftried to calm the rau-
cous scene.
"This is enough. The court
wants to carry on and provide
you with the guarantees neces-
sary" for a fair trial, he said.
But Morsi repeated at least
four times, "I am the president

of the republic."
He rejected the proceedings
and said he had been forced to
attend. "I am here by force and
against my will. The coup is a
crime and treason," he said
Morsi refused to enter a plea
and demanded that he be given a
microphone, although his voice
was loud enough for everyone
in the courtroom to hear.
"This is not my court," Morsi
went on. "This court, with all
due respect, doesn't have juris-
diction over the president.
There is a military coup in this
country. The leaders of this
coup must be brought to trial
according to the constitution."
At one point, some journal-
ists in court shouted: "Execu-
tion, you will get execution,
Morsi!"
Morsi had set the unruly
tone, interrupting the judge,
speaking when he wanted to,
and once even talking over a
defense lawyer. "I want to com-
ment here," he said.
Similarly defiant was
Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior
Brotherhood leader who repeat-
edly interrupted the judge.
"You are not paying atten-
tion. You will get the chance to
speak," the judge told him.
Snapped el-Beltagy: "It is you
who is not paying attention."
After a rowdy 10 minutes,
Youssef adjourned the session
because of the interruptions.
When it resumed more than 75
minutes later, the lawyers had
had their first meeting with
Morsi and the co-defendants.
Lawyer Mohammed El-Dam-
aty said Morsi spent most of
the time inquiring about condi-
tions in Egypt, his supporters
and what happened during his
detention.

ducation is supposed to be
the best way up the social
ladder, but sometimes it
seems like col-
lege reinforces,
class boundar-
ies rather than,
breaking them.
College - as we
all know - is
expensive. There
isn't enough LISSA
financial aid to go KRYSKA
around, and only
affluent families
or those who've saved up can afford
to pay full-price tuition. As a result,
the student debt total now exceeds
credit card debt in the United States.
Partly because of how expensive
tuition is, it's common for students
across all income levels to work
while in college. But there's a differ-
ence between working to have some
spare change and working to pay
rent. When your rent or food bud-
get depends on how many hours you
work, you have to work more hours,
and those are hours that students
who don't have to work can spend on
academics or extracurricular activi-
ties. If you need a job to pay the rent,
you can't afford to be as selective in
terms of choosing one that's relevant
to your career goals.
Unpaid internships accentuate
the problem. One need understand
only the concept of opportunity cost
- that even when you aren't paying
money for something, you're still for-
going the money you could have been
making doing something else - to
see why they are#a problem. Unpaid
internships can offer great experi-
ences, connections, a useful line on
your resume and an edge in land-
ing choice jobs after graduation. But
for many students, going a whole
summer without a paycheck isn't
an option. And while you can learn
useful skills at any job, the paid stu-

dent jobs with the most hours avail-
able tend to be less relevant to future
career goals.
Like the rest of society, students
tend to hang out with people in the
same social class. This isn't always
the case, and I don't believe it's
intentional - it's usually a matter
of convenience. You're looking for
housing in the same price range and
are more likely to end up in the same
neighborhood or building. When
you go out together, you're willing
and able to spend the same amount
of money. No one wants to be the.
one friend who can't go to Mexico
on spring break or who can't chip
in to pay for the birthday girl's din-
ner, or to feel like they can't do the
activities they want because they
don't want to embarrass a friend
who can't afford it. But the result
is that most students' networks
are composed disproportionately
of people in the same social class.
Which means that when looking

While the number of low-income
students who enroll in college is
already low - the Brookings Insti-
tute estimates fewer than 30 per-
cent of those in the bottom quartile
enroll in a four-year program- many
of these students don't graduate. All
those programs pushing kids to go to
college aren't going to change any-
thing if the kids don't finish.
The University of Michigan actu-
ally has a lot of great programs to
combat these problems, like the
Summer Bridge Program to help stu-
dents adjust to college rigor, and the
Comprehensive Studies Program to
provide a closer level of support and
interaction throughout a student's
college years. There are funds avail-
able to support students taking on
unpaid internships. And the six-
year graduation rate is 90.6 percent,
higher than the national average.

Ward 2 should embrace the city

There is very little doubt that
Ann Arbor City Councilmember
Jane Lumm will be re-elected to
serve Ward 2 in the upcoming
election. She's extremely popular
in her district and simply has too
much momentum citywide as the
leader of the anti-Mayor John Hief-
tje coalition at a time when he is
unpopular. In the last election, she
was elected by a large margin by
focusing on reducing funding for
"discretionary" things like public
art while being in favor of increas-
ing funding for basic public servic-
es and changing pedestrian laws in
Ann Arbor. She also made sure to
point out the novelty that she was
running without party affiliation,
which might have actually been a
breath of fresh air if not for the fact
that she was a stalwart of the now
moribund Ann Arbor Republican
Party just a few years ago.
Her main opponent in this race,
Democrat Kirk Westphal, is quick
to point out that Lumm is a conser-
vative, even linking her with the
Tea Party. However, that's not an
appropriate assessment. She is on
the right - probably a Republican
in any city other than Ann Arbor
- but she's not as far to the right as
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Her will-
ingness to work with Democrats on
the council just shows how will-
ing she is to work on a bipartisan
basis - although it helps that the

Democratic council members she's
usually working with are also anti-
Hieftje. However, even though she
isn't what Westphal portrays her to
be, there are some issues with her
record that will make me unable to
vote for her on Nov.5.
Not only has she pushed for essen-
tially cutting off all city funding for
public art - a proposal that is con-
troversial enough - she's also hurled
her opposition toward the new rail-
road station, a railroad station which
is necessary if we want Ann Arboion
the Detroit-Chicago Amtrak high-
speed rail line. I'm of the belief that
connecting Ann Arbor to Chicago
via high-speed rail is an essential
project. Whether we like it or not,
the University, which has strong
links to Chicago, is the main spark
plug of Ann Arbor's economy. Cut-
ting travel time to and from Chicago
by as much as two hours will make
it easier for students from Chicago
to visit their homes over the week-
end and will also make it easier for
alumni to bring their children here
to show them how great this city and
University really are. Furthermore,
her plan to end municipal/state
confusion over pedestrian laws is to
merely take the right of way away
from pedestrians - that's it.
Based on these policies, one could
get the ideas that Lumm isn't the
biggest fan of pedestrians, bicyclists
or the art community and is also

opposed to measures which will help
lead to Ann Arbor's success. I've lived
in Ward 2 for 18 of my 20 years, and
although I'm the sort of mild-man-
nered person who enjoys life in Ward
2, there's a small but disturbingly
voeal element in this part of town
that doesn't seem to like the down-
town part of the city.
This element finds pedestrians
and bicyclists to be a nuisance, they
complain that the city has been los-
ing its charm, yet are also the most
vocal in opposition to Ann Arbor's
arts culture. They seem to be afraid
of Ann Arbor having too much suc-
cess because they suspect that Ann
Arbor being more successful will
mean that Downtown Ann Arbor
will expand into their backyard,
which is problematic because these
people are afraid of people younger,
hipper and poorer than they are.
This is the element in Ann Arbor
politics that Lumm represents -
because members of this element are
in the demographic most likely to
vote in local elections, Lumm wins
by large margins. Fear helps explain
why Lumm would be so electorally
successful. However, I think there's
nothingtobe afraid of-there'snoth-
ing wrong with promoting creativ-
ity and growth in Ann Arbor. Being
able to visit Chicago over a weekend
would be nice, too.

"Popped Molly, I'm sweating."
'Y our Mind' only
good in small doses

Cut Copy appeals to
the Molly-popping
generation
By ADAM THIESEN
Daily Arts Writer
While its last few albums
were mostly praised by critics,
Cut Copy hasn't exactly become
a household
name since its --
formation over
10 years ago Free Your
(unless your Mind
household is
very hip and Cut Copy
into indie-
dance groups). Modolar
This can be
hard to believe sometimes, as
the Australian musicians release
infectious, upbeat, happy music;
the kind that this latest effort,
Free Your Mind, epitomizes.
However, like the drugs that
the album obliquely refers to,
Cut Copy songs only work when
they're enjoyed in small doses -
not as a whole album.
The album's first real song
and title track hits you immedi-
ately and perfectly exemplifies
what can make Cut Copy so good.
Singer Dan Whitford's blissed-
out vocals sing sometimes unin-
telligible but always cheerful
lyrics over a masterfully layered,
irresistible beat. The perfect mix
of drums, bass, catchy piano and
backing vocals shows the band's
excellent craftsmanship. The rest

of Free Your Mind follows the
exact same blueprint for all the
remaining songs, with varying
levels of success. There isn't even
a single crescendo to be found -
a disappointment, considering
that the slow burn of "Need You
Now," the opening track of the
band's last effort, was the best
moment of its career. However,
even though Free Your Mind hits
one sole note for its entire run-
time, when that note is euphoria,
the songs can be a joy to listen to.
Throughout the whole record,
Cut Copy lets its pop indulgences
run wild with no subtlety what-
soever. Current electronic trends
collide with late-1970s disco as
the band looks to the past for
inspiration. Earworm choruses
and sparkling fanfare synths
demand attention and make the
whole thingsimple fun, but when
the group isn't using absolutely
everything at its disposal to grab
you, the songs can dissolve into
foot-tapping background noise.
Cut Copy is definitely a singles
band, one that places its filler
songs strategically in the album's
sequence in order to elevate the
best tracks.
As the title implies and the
trippy sampled vocals of the inter-
ludes reinforce, Free Your Mind
isn't intended to be listened to
while sober. In Cut Copy, with its
builds, looped vocals and promi-
nent bass, The Molly Generation
has found the closest thing it will
ever get to a true "rock" band.
The songs' inspirational hippie-
preacher lyrics encourage listen-

ers to "shine brighter than the
sun," but more important than
the lyrics is the overall hypnotic
sound of the vocals, which are
used more or less as just another
instrument in the mix.
What really sinks Free Your
Mind, though, is the same thing
that sinks any drug experi-
ence: the comedown. The bright
exhilaration that fuels all of the
songs becomes absolutely unpal-
atable over the course of the
whole record. As the album runs
on, the band seems to get tired
of itself, eventually not bother-

beats. The less complicated
songs have the potential to work,
but Cut Copy just doesn't seem
to have the energy to keep things
interesting. Eventually, the gos-
pel handclaps of slowed-down
penultimate song "Walking in

ears simply because they sound
different.
Taken singularly, Cut Copy's
greatest songs are excellent,
comparable to the best bands
of its generation. One hit of Cut
Copy is happy, enjoyable and
easy to dance to. But, listening
to the 14 tracks of Free Your

bars - or taking 14 hits of Molly,
if you're in the band's target
audience. While Cut Copy has
proven that they can write one
very specific, admittedly very
fun, type of song, the band
needs to branch out in order to
make an album worth remem-
bering.

The Marshall Mathers LP2 isn't
a direct sequel to The Marshall
Mathers LP; this point should
be stressed
when listening -
to Eminem's
most recent The
album. Rather, Marshall
The Marshall
Mathers LP 2 Mathers
serves as the LP2
second install-
ment in the Eminem
two-part auto-
biography that Shady
is Eminem's life.
The first LP highlighted the angry,
"I-just-don't-give-a-fuck" Eminem
(or was it Slim Shady?) that we've
learned to love and hate. This sec-
ond LP is a sentimental trip down
memory lane that introduces the
newer, more mature 41-year-old
artist
While there is a concept of
revisiting the past, there is no
cohesive link between tracks on
The Marshall Mathers LP2. Butwe
shouldn't be surprised - this is the
musician with perhaps one of the
most varied discographies to date.
After experimenting with musical
styles for the past decade, Eminem
has finally balanced musical inno-
vation and nostalgia. And this is
where The Marshall Mathers LP 2
truly shines: in the versatility of it
all.
There are elements that both
Eminem fans and other audiences
can appreciate. Rock and country
fans alike will be surprised to
hear'Eminem not only rapping
but also singing over guitar sam-
ples, including Joe Walsh's "Life's
Been Good." Pop listeners should
also find enjoyment in the catchy
yet smooth singing features that
appear throughout the album.
Eminem even breaks into song
himself on some tracks for both
extended verses and on the hooks.
The manner in which Marshall
has fused hip hop, pop and even
rock is seamless.
This versatility, however,
doesn't alienate hip-hop listen-
ers. Eminem demonstrates that,
despite the passing of time, he is
stillone of hip hop's bestlyricists.
He raps in a way that is reminis-
cent of the hunger he exhibited
when first rapping, but the style
isn't the same recycled flow from
his previous albums. For the first
time in a while, Eminem seems
happy, and this new style reflects
that. The only rap feature, Ken-
drick Lamar, also surprises on
"Love Game" by mirroring Slim
Shady's humorous yet strange
style.

listeners, references to older

The "crazfness" of the weekend is
regulated to suit the age of the char-
acters, and there's nothing wrong
with that.
The writing is also tailored to
suit the characters. This isn't an
extraordinarily funny group of
70-year-olds; they're adeqiuately
funny, injected with just the right
amount of humor to make them
seem like- real. people. At times
things move along a little too slow-
ly, and the introduction of Mary
Steenburgen ("The Proposal") as
Paddy's love interest does little to
remedy the situation. However, her
charming performance is endear-
ing and brings a sense of warmth
as the weekend unfolds and her
character plays a crucial part in the
climax.
The film is watchable solely
because of the comfortable chemis-
try betweentheaniable cast.'When
the writing temporarily fails, the
performances of all actors steady
the ship and keep us watching to
the very end; a running time of 105
minutes is the perfect length for
such a movie. The ending rounds
things off nicely, and everyone
- the actors and the audience -
comes away having experienced a
weekend that was, while not crazy,
a memorable one.

'U' alum to present
diverse 'Friends'

Jonathan Chapman
Cook to perform
contemporary piece
By JOHN BOHN
Daily Community Culture Editor
This Tuesday, University alum
Jonathan Chapman Cook will pres-
ent a selected program of piano
compositions
titled "Among Among
Friends: A Friends: A
Recital of
Contempo- Recital of
rary Piano Contemporary
Music."
Drawing from Piano
the works Tuesday at 9 p.m.
of fellow
composers Moore Building
that he has Free
befriended
over the years,
Cook will performa contemporary
moment, crafting a living com-
munity of artists through personal
relations and sustained musical
engagement.
"My feeling has always been that
any music deserves the same kind of
attention as the classical repertoire,"
Cook said. "I wanted to devote a
lengthy amount of time to an entire
program of music by composers
who I personally know, to put the
kind of work into it that one would
put into a classical repertoire."
The pieces are diverse, ranging
from improvisational explorations
of Arabic modes and rhythms to
the attempt to musically reflect
the physics of subatomic particles,
as well as Cook's own synthesis of
Chopin-inspired techniques and
popular cultural forms. For many
of the pieces, Cook will be the first
pianist beyond the composer to
perform the work, and for that rea-
son this project presents its own
questions and concerns, distinct
from how one would approach the
classical repertoire in which Cook
was trained.
"There's more territory when
you study a Beethoven sonata,"
Cook said. "People have studied
this music extensively, and so you
have this institution, this establish-

ment, that dictates."
Freedom from encumbering
tradition and legacies of interpre-
tation presents its own challenge,
however.
"Every individual has a huge con-
fluence of influences, all of which
are going into this piece," Cook said.
"Some of those influences you may
be familiar with, and some you may
not be familiar with. So you really
are dealingwith ajungle when play-
ing contemporaryrepertoire.
"I think that a lot of people are a
little bit afraid to study contempo-
rary music because the guidelines
are not as set in stone."
While Cook has, on occasion,
consulted the composers for assis-
tance and insight,muchofthe prep-
aration has been his own.
"I've really enjoyed taking these
pieces and making them my own
in a certain way," Cook said. "I am
going to do everything I can to be
faithful to the composer's desires,
but what Ilike about the music that
I've been given is that it allows a lot
of room for my own personality to
come through."
For Cook, this room for person-
ality is critical. His foray into con-
temporary music is in many ways
a response to his experiences with
performance and composition edu-
cation and comes after a journey of
self-exploration following his grad-
uation in211from the University's
Masters in Piano Performance pro-
gram.
During that first year following
graduation, Cook stopped perform-
ingand practicingcompletely.
"I just needed to step back from
things," Cook said. "It's been an
interesting process leaving music
school very consciously just know-
ing at a certain point that I needed
to get out. I think something in me
knew that it was suffocatingme."
"For instance," Cook added, "in
one of my first composition classes,
I was writing music using quartal
harmony. ... It's basically the inter-
val of a perfect fourth. And I just
really love the sound of just stack-
ing fourths on top of each other
and using them in different ways.
And the first thing I was told was,
'No you shouldn't stack fourths on
top of each other like that. If you're

going to use fourths you have to
hide it in there,' which is a com-
pletelyarbitrarylesson"
Upon returning to the piano,
Cook took on a variety of projects
- from improvisation to the clas-
sical. Then last November, Cook
conceived the project that would
become "Among Friends."
"I wanted to do a contempo-
rary music project," Cook said.
"I thought I would write a piece
for it, and then I started thinking
about other composers who I knew
between Western Michigan, the
University of Michigan and here in
Lexington, Virginia."
The first composer who came
to mind was Benjamin Bourlier,
whom Cook met while studying at
Western Michigan.
"It was kind of like everything
in my life changed after I met Ben,"
Cook said. "(His work) justblew me
away."
Bourlier's composition"L'escalier
sans maitre" will be the final piece
performed and is, as Cook says, one
of the most difficult pieces he has
ever played. The program describes
it as a "complex stylistic pun" draw-
ing from two works of the 20th cen-
tury - Gyorgy Ligeti's"L'escalier du
diable" and Pierre Boulez's "Le mar-
teausansmaitre."
"I personally don't claim I know
nearly half of what is underlying
this piece, but it just struck me as
an extraordinarily energetic and
charged piece of music," Cook said.
Bourlier, along with Western
Michigan piano accompanist Cas-
sandra Kaczor, Lecturer in Music
at Washington and Lee University
Byron Petty, University alumn and
Royal Schools of Music certified
pianist and theorist Donia Jarrar
and University Composition and
Music Theory doctoral candidate
Evan Ware, provided Cook with
the material to be heard at "Among
Friends" Tuesday.
"I personally think the living
community is tremendously impor-
tant," Cook said." ... I think that
having a community of performers
relatingto composersgets us closer
to what we're experiencing in our
contemporary life and how indi-
viduals are expressingthat through
art."

Lewan apologizes for conduct

FOOTBAL
Recruiting Rundown
By JAKE LOURIM (Ill) 42; Rankings: ESPN (118)
Daily Sports Writer Scout (268)
Bunting had six receptions

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Leading up to the Michigan
State game, Taylor Lewan kept*
harping on the fact that he didn't
want the Wolverines to be "bul-
lied" by the Spartans like they
were two years ago in a loss to
the Spartans in East Lansing.
But this weekend, not much
was different from the last time
Michigan took the 63-mile trip
northwest, as the Spartans eas-
ily dismantled the Wolverines,
29-6.
The only thing that changed
was who instigated the bullying.
ESPN.com reported on Mon-
day morning that the Big Ten
is currently reviewing a play in
which Lewan, a fifth-year senior
left tackle, twisted the facemask
of'Michigan State defensive end
Isaiah Lewis.
"My assessment is that's not
what we want to portray or
be," said Michigan coach Brady
Hoke. "Him and I have had a dis-
cussion regarding that. It's not
who we are."
Hoke - who said Lewan's
actions were rooted in him
being "a very good teammate" -
doesn't plan to discipline Lewan
further, adding, "I think if he
should have been suspended, I
would have already done it."
Lewan apologized for his
behavior on Monday.
"What I did was wrong," he
said. "I was just trying to protect
my guys. There's always a differ-
ent way to go about it. I should
have gone about it a different
way. I can't take it back now."
Lewan searched for Lewis on
the field after the game to apolo-
gize but was unable to find him.
Though he didn't talk to Lewis,
he did have a serious chat with
Hoke about his actions.
"At the end of the day, he told
me I'm representing 134 years of
Michigan football," Lewan said.
"(I'm the) 134th captain of this
team. It's a big deal. That's not
representing the University of
Michigan the way it should be.


The Michigan Daily's
Recruiting Rundown returns

gan's top football recruits as

and was ultimately suspended
for one game by the Big Ten for
the incident. Neither Hoke nor
Lewan would comment on any

Hoke: Offensive line doesn't
deserve all of the blame

5 Things We Learned

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
It's easy to make snap judg-
ments with a number like nega-
tive 48, to pass the blame and to
point fingers.
The reason the Michigan foot-
ball team rushed for the low-
est amount of yards in program
history is purely because of the
offense line, right? Shouldn't all
the blame go to that young, beat-
up offensive line?
Well, not exactly. Blame cer-
tainly still goes to that unit, but
it's not that easy.
"The backs need to be able to
pick (blitzes) up a little better,"
said Michigan coach Brady Hoke
in a press conference on Mon-
day. "There were probably one or
two times when the quarterback
needed to step up on the field a
little better. There's sometimes
the timing of the route. It's hit or
miss. You have 10 guys good, one
guy bad, like anything else that's
why it's a great team sport. You
have to have them all the same."
In Saturday's 29-6 loss to Mich-
igan State, Michigan quarterback
Devin Gardner was sacked seven
times on 34 drop-backs. Even on
the plays he wasn't sacked, the
redshirt junior was getting hit. By
the end of the game, he sat on the
sidelines while freshman Shane
Morris finished the bludgeoning
for the Wolverines. Hoke said
Monday that he expects Gardner
to play, but fifth-year senior offen-
sive tackle Taylor Lewan said that
Gardner was very sore on Sunday.
Of the many factors that played
into Michigan's negative 48 rush-
ing yards, the running backs and
their ability to pick up blitzes
stood out. The only running
back who saw significant min-
utes on Saturday was fifth-year
senior Fitzgerald Toussaint. One
* backup, freshman Derrick Green,
played two snaps and missed one
blitz protection pickup.
"Fitz is our best pass protec-
tor," Hoke said. "Has been. For
some of theyoung guys, it's a little

Redshirt freshman center Graham Glasgow recently moved from guard to center.

more difficult."
Hoke's comments aside, Tous-
saint struggled in blitz protec-
tions on Saturday. Part ofthat was
because he was constantly forced
to run play actions that were fool-
ing no one, butstill, the protection
wasn't there.
Gardner and his tendency to
hang onto the ball a half-second
longer than usual was another
problem. That might not seem
like much, but when a defense as
good as the Spartans is barreling
down at you, it's a big deal.
The oft-discussed offensive
line, which started its fourth
unit in as many games last week,
has been a big discussion point in
Hoke's press conferences over the
last two months, through all the
swaps and the shuffling.
The biggest issue, he continues
to say, is experience. The more
experience the young interior
linemen get, the better. The prob-
lem is that Michigan is running
out of time and games to see that
maturation come to fruition, at
least for the 2013 season.
"It's a youth problem as much
as anything," Hoke said. "The
only way to fix it is experience. I

wouldn't trade (freshman guard
Kyle) Bosch, (redshirt freshman
guard Erik) Magnuson or red-
shirt sophomore center Graham)
Glasgow for anybody, or the other
guys who are competing with
them. You just have to keep every
day grinding, and showing them
the looks and doing everything
you can."
Even with the inexperience
and shuffling, the offensive line
shouldn't get a free pass. The
bottom line is that if Michigan
is going to bounce back from the
beatdown in East Lansing, the
line is going to have to play better.
Still, it's important to remem-
ber that there's more going on
than purely what the guys up
front are doing.
"What it really comes down
to is going 100 percent on every
play," Lewan said. "When you're
young, you really think about the
whole game, 60 minutes of foot-
ball. In reality, you need to focus
on one play at a time. Those guys
need to learn that. They will.
They're progressing. Obviously
we didn't have a good day on Sat-
urday, but we'll get better and
we'll learn from it."

1. Michigan has depth beyond
the line chart.
In place of injured freshman
defenseman Kevin Lohan - who
will miss at least three months
after suffering a. lower-body
injury Friday that will require
surgery- junior Mike Chiasson
made his season debut on a pair-
ing with senior Kevin Clare.
The defense allowed just one
goal in a 2-1 victory, going 6-for-
6 on the penalty kill. And though
there were no injuries on offense
this weekend, two Wolverines
notched points in their second
starts of the season Saturday.
Sophomore forward Justin
Selman netted what was ulti-
mately the game-winning goal
for Michigan in the third period
Saturday. Freshman defenseman
Michael Downing and junior
forward Andrew Sinelli record-
ed the assist.
Sinelli's sixth career assist
came in his second appearance
this season.
"He's a junior now, and he's a
pretty good hockey player," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson
on Saturday. "There's some com-
petition now between about six
or seven guys to get in the lineup
and stay in the lineup. But that's
good for our team."
2. Nagelvoort has pipes
between the pipes.
With an ability to play the
puck as well as stop it, freshman
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort acts
as a sixth skater on the ice at all
times. Nagelvoort's performance
in place of injured sophomore
Steve Racine has kept the Wol-
verines out of the loss column on
more than one occasion through
five starts.
On Friday, Nagelvoort could
be heard from the rafters in Yost
Ice Arena, shouting "plenty of
time" to calm a hasty power play
and direct the defense in front of
him.

"The defense did a really great
job," Nagelvoort said Saturday.
"They let me see pretty much
everything in front of me. There
were'only really two or three
chances where they had any
opportunities for shots; they just
played really well tonight."
Nagelvoort has a reason to be
calm. The freshman is now 4-1-1
on the season and has survived
three overtime games without
allowing the game-winning goal.
He boasts a .948 save percentage
- the second-best percentage in
the nation - and hasn't given up
more than a pair of goals in any
start.
3. The power play lacks mus-
cle.
Sophomore forward Andrew
Copp's first-period goal on Satur-
day against the Huskies was the
first power-play goal since Oct.
18 against New Hampshire, and
the only one scored in five such
opportunities duringthe game.
Though Michigan's power
play is 8-for-32 this season, it is
arguably the Wolverines' weak-
est unit thus far. The power play
scored two goals in the season
opener against No. 8 Boston Col-
lege but has been held to one or
fewer since.
Still, drawing penalties will
eventually lead to goals, right?
"(Power plays) help us to get
out offensively and get in an
early rhythm," Copp said. "It def-
initely helps to get shots on net."
But eventually, luck aside, the
Wolverines will struggle to win
games decided by one goal. It
will be the power play's respon-
sibility to find the back of the net,
especially against a team like
Michigan Tech.
4. But the penalty kill is killer.
Before the season, senior
defenseman Mac Bennett said
that the defense - which had
been pegged as Michigan's big-
gest question mark following the
departure of former blue liners-
Jon Merrill and Jacob Trouba -
would surprise alot of people.

A defense that boasted three
starting freshmen has allowed
more than two goals in a game
only once this season - in a 7-4
victory over Rochester Institute
of Technology. Michigan gives
up an average of 1.47 goal per
game, which is important con-
sidering the Wolverines have
scored three or more goals just
twice this season.
On Friday, Michigan took its
first five-on-three penalty kill of
the season when junior defense-
man Brennan Serville was called
for boarding. The penalty kill
fended off Michigan Tech for
4:42 of the five-minute disadvan-
tage before surrendering its fifth
goal of the season.
Without Lohan on Saturday,
the Wolverines killed 12 minutes
worth of penalties without sur-
rendering a goal
5. Bold Prediction: Nagelvoort
is Michigan's new No.1.
After missing a weekend
against Boston University and
UMass-Lowell, Racine practiced
in full pads in the week leading
up to Michigan Tech but was
listed as a backup and didn't see
the ice in either game.
Berenson has said several
times that, although Racine felt
he could play if necessary, the
sophomore is not yet 100 per-
cent. With the bye week coming
up and a hot-handed backup in
Nagelvoort, what's the rush?
But what Berenson is not say-
ing is that Nagelvoort's impres-
sive play in five starts is a happy,
but confusingsurprise.
Nagelvoort is better at play-
ing the puck and allows fewer
rebounds..He is bigger and more
vocal.
With each win he notches
while Racine is resting, especial-
ly at home, the freshman earns a
bigger share of that starting job.
There is certainly potential
for a two-goalie option for the
remainder of the season, ahappy
problem to have. Still, don't
be surprised if it's Nagelvoort
minding the net in Omaha, Neb.
next weekend.

Sluggish 'M' gets win

Rebounding a concern

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Against Concordia last Tues-
day, freshman guard Derrick
Walton Jr. had to wait four min-
utes before he entered the game.
In the Michigan men's basketball
team's second exhibition game on
Monday, he didn't have to wait at
all.
This time around, it took a bit
for him to get going in Michi-
gan's final preseason tuneup - a
79-60 win-
over Wayne WAYNESTATE 60
State. MICHIGAN 79
Starting
for the first time - which won't
count since it was just an exhi-
bition' - Walton looked shaky
and, well, like a freshman. After
scoring 11 points off the bench
last week, it took him nearly 13
minutes to score his first point
on Monday. After missing his
first shot on an air ball, Walton
grabbed one rebound before
being taken out in place of last
game's starter, sophomore guard
Spike Albrecht.
Albrecht shined in his initial
minutes of play, entering in after
five minutes of action. He looked
in control against the Warriors,
making a 3-pointer and a driving
layup in less than two minutes of
play. Despite his strong perfor-
mance early on, Albrecht played
just 13 minutes, compared to Wal-
ton's 27.
One freshman did stand out
coming off the bench. With the
game still relatively close after
almost eight minutes of action,
forward Zak Irvin knocked down
three consecutive 3-pointers to
push Michigan's lead from four
to eight. He would finish with 13
points.
"I wanted to get Derrick and
Zak as many minutes as we could
out there," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "I think they need-
ed to get out there and make some
mistakes and have some success.
And they did both of those things
today."

Stats against cupcake teams
outside the Division I landscape
must often be viewed with a
grain of salt. Powerhouses like
Michigan are used to putting up
crooked numbers in early season
games that fill the beginning of
November's slate.
But after dismantling NAIA
Concordia and blowing away the
Cardinals in every stat category
last week, the Wolverines' box
score against Division II Wayne
State particularly the War-
riors' edge on the glass - weren't
nearly as impressive. And that
has to be at least somewhat con-
cerning.
Since guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. departed last April for the
NBA Draft, Michigan coach John
Beileinhastalked aboutfillinghis
void in the starting lineup with a
second big man to accompany
forward Mitch McGary, who
took the NCAA Tournament by
storm. Beilein of course couldn't
account for the lower-back condi-
tion that would sideline McGary
for at least the immediate future,
but in his absence, veteran for-
wards Jon Horford and Jordan
Morgan started in Michigan's

two exhibitions.
Though the Wolverines were
never truly threatened - they
won, 79-60 - the game never
got out of hand like it probably
should have, even though Michi-
gan's starters and key contribu-
tors played until the final horn.
Worse yet, Beilein noted that
three of the Warriors regular
starters were out with injuries.
Sophomore guard Nik Staus-
'kas admitted that Michigan's play
was "maybe a little bit sluggish,"
and that few things Wayne State
did came as a shock to the Wol-
verines - particularly the way
the Warriors crashed the boards.
That was something Michigan
saw in film from the teams' pre-
vious matchup, after Wayne State
out-rebounded Michigan, 40-31,
in a narrow, 47-39, loss two years
ago.
"It wasn't really surprising,
because I think that was in the
scouting report, that they were
going to crash the boards hard, so
we definitely have to get a little
tougher on our box outs," Staus-
kas said.
Despite a clear size disadvan-
tage, Wayne State out-rebounded
the Wolverines, 36-31. The War-
riors' tallest player - starting
center Michael Martin - stands

just 6-foot-8, a few inches short-
er than Horford, and 40 pounds
lighter than both Horford and
Morgan. Wayne State's next tall-
est player is 6-foot-6, the same
size as most of the Wolverines'
perimeter players.
Michigan gave up an eye-
opening 15 offensive boards, and
though Wayne State couldn't,
make the most of its opportu-
nities - it scored just 14 sec-
ond-chance points - Beilein
expressed marginal concern.
"I think our-guys have to learn
that just because you're out on
the perimeter, doesn't mean you
(don't) have to get in there," he
said. "We've got to look at boxing
out and are we even in the area?
We're leaving Jon down there
and they were crashing three or
four people."
Horford couldn't capitalize on
his size advantage on the offen-
sive end, scoring just two points,
but his gane-high nine rebounds
were enough to catch his coach's
attention. But going forward,
Beilein wants to see a more com-
plete effort on the glass.
"We were experimenting a lit-
tle here and there," he said. "Jon
rebounded really well but the
other guys, I mean, we've got to
get more rebounds out of them."

TERRA MOLLENGRAFF/Daily
Freshman guard Derrick Walton Jr. started the exhibition game on Monday.

found success when he reen-
tered the game. With 5:46 left
in the first half, Walton finally
looked more relaxed and like the
dynamic player we saw against
Concordia. Stealing the ball from
mid-court, Walton drove toward
the basket with sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas on his left. With a
man in the lane, Walton dished
the ball off to Stauskas, who got
the layup and drew the foul for
what would be a 3-point play.
"I really like his potential
to play really good on-the-ball
defense," Beilein said. "They were
running some action today that
we've yet to think about a little bit
and he spotted it right away and
called it out, which is really rare
for a point guard."
With that basket and the foul
shot, Michigan was finally able
to push the lead past 10 points
for the first time and comfortably
keep the double-digit lead for the
rest of the contest. It was after
that scoring play, too, that Walton.
was finally able to make his first
shot from the field, as he com-
pleted a 4-point play after getting
knocked down on a three from
the corner.
Walton would go onto lead the
team with four assists, tied with

the Wolverines' leading scorer,
Stauskas, who had 17 points to
go with six rebounds. Michigan's
other double-digit scorers were
sophomores Glen Robinson III
and Cars LeVert, who had 15 and
16 points, respectively.
Despite Michigan's strong
shooting from the field and
behind the arc - 15-23 and 7-11
respectively - in the first 'half,
Wayne State's five 3-pointers -
including three by the Warriors'
leading scorer Bryan Coleman
- and 13-to-12 advantage on the
glass allowed it to stick with the
Wolverines for most of the first
half. For the game, Wayne State
would outrebound Michigan
36-31, including15-6 on the offen-
sive boards.
While it never appeared Mich-
igas would lose the game, there
weren't any big scoring bursts
like the Wolverines' 46-10 run to
end the first half last week that
completely put the game out of
hand. As a result, just one of the
other four freshmen - forward
Mark Donnal - saw any action.
The quartet played 17 combined
minutes last week. With the regu-
lar season starting on Friday, the
group's last chance for playing
time may have come and gone.

Michigan closes out home
schedule with 1-0 victory

By FREDDY KASTEN

It was only fitting that when a
penaltykick was issued to Michi-
gan, with the chance to grab an
early lead and momentum, that
forward Fabio Pereira would get
the chance.
Arguably_

Michigan MICHIGAN 1
men's soc-
cer team'sbest scorers, the senior
has been in a bit of slump this
season. But in his last home game
of his collegiate career, he came
through when he was needed
most.
Behind Pereira, the Wol-
verines (3-2-0 Big Ten, 8-5-3
overall) kept their NCAA Tour-
nament hopes alive and gave the
six seniors a night they will never
forget ina 1-0 win over Valparai-
so (0-3-2 Horizon League, 3-7-5).
Nearly 27 minutes into the
first half, Crusader defender Zev
Taublieb was called for a hand-
ball in the box, giving Michigan
an easy opportunity in what
was otherwise a back-and-forth
game.
Pereira approached the ball
slowly, looked right and fired left
into the bottom corner of the net
for his second goal of the season.
"I practice PKs a lot, so I kind
of just decided right when I went
to kick it and I went bottom left,"
Pereira said. "It's a great feel-
ing scoring on any night, but on
a night like this, it's pretty spe-
cial. Coming out with a win is the
most important thing though.
Hopefully we can extend our sea-
son to the NCAA Tournament."
From there, it was Michigan's
seniors who fittingly carried the
team for the rest of the first half.
Forward TJ Roehn, for example,
led the -charge on the attack,
nearly scoring in the 40th minute
with a chance to end any come-
back hopes.
