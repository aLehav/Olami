ELECTION 2012
Levin urges
legislators
to prioritize
higher ed.

IT'S IN 3D, DUDE

At Detroit event,
senator meets with
campus leaders,
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily Staff Reporter
DETROIT - During a small
group discussion with students
from the. University of Michi-
gan, Michigan State University
and the Detroit School of Arts
High School, U.S. Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.) opened by
admitting he is a Wolverine fan,
drawing laughs of disapproval
fromthe MSUstudents.
As he continued his address,
held at the University's Detroit
Center, he discussed the impor-
tance of prioritizing legislation
related to higher education ini-
tiatives and discussed President
Barack Obama's performance in
last week's debate.
"We are truly a great univer-
sity state," Levin said. "I think
population-wise we may have
the best higher education sys-
tem and maybe the most exten-
sive higher education system."
Levin's speechis part of a The
Legislative Collaborative - a
four-part political forum jointly
sponsored by the University's
Detroit Center and the nearby

MSU Detioit Center to engage
students with politicians. The
three other speakers have yet
to be confirmed, according to
Addell Austin Anderson, the
director of the University's
Detroit Center.
During his
speech, Levin
emphasized
his belief that2 Y1 I
America must
work together
to improve its schools for the
sake of future economic stabil-
ity and job growth.
"We ... have, in high-tech
areas, an ability to bring in alot
of people to fill jobs where yet
we don't have enough Ameri-
can students getting ready to fill
(those)," Levin said. "We got to
change that.
Headded that it's impera-
tive that America's colleges
strengthen programs in the sci-
ences in order to continue to be
globally competitive.
"We got to get much greater
emphasis on math and on sci-
ence - science particularly
- in this country so that we
don't need to have folks come
in (from other countries) to fill
that demand."
In an interview after the
event, Levin expressed frustra-

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BEFORE THE COURT
High- cort willaddress
race-based admissions.

Fisher v. U of Texas
could change how
affirmative action
is used nationally
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
The U.S. Supreme Court will
hear oral arguments on Wednes-

day in a case that has the poten-
tial to redefine the way race is
interpreted in higher education
admissions.
Fisher v. University of Texas
- which began in 2007 when
the University of Texas denied
admission of white student Abi-
gail Fisher - has given the court
the opportunity to review, reaf-
firm or reverse its rulings in the
two 2003 cases involving the
University of Michigan, Gratz

v. Bollinger and Grutter. v. Bol-
linger.
The two cases have served as
the foundation in defining the
uneasy status quo surrounding
the use of race in college admis-
sions. In 2003, the court decid-
ed the University's practice of
awarding points toward admis-
sion based solely on race failed
to fairly weigh the diversity of
each candidate. Instead, Grutter
upheld a holistic approach where

race could be considered a valid
factor in the context of additional
qualifications.
In 2007, Fisher posed a new
challenge to affirmative action
efforts in Texas. Fisher attended
a competitive, predominantly
white high school, but was not
part of the top 10 percent of her
class. At the University of Texas,
the top 10 percent of every high
school class in the state gains

Lack of accessibility causes

At meeting, 'U'
CIO says talks

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Laura Patterson, the Univer-
sity's chief information officer,
spoke to the Central Student
Government on Tuesday night in

response to a resolution passed
last week that disapproved of the
University's adoption of Google
services that are not fully acces-
sible to disabled students.
Patterson said the University
recognizes that the services pro-
vided through Google are not
fully accessible to students with
vision difficulty, some learning
disabilities and other impair-
ments, and it is working with the
company to improve user-friend-
liness.
"We knew at the time that

Google was not accessible and
we knew this because many
other universities had gone to
Google before the University of
Michigan," she said. "But Google
assured us that they were making
significant investment in making
their product accessible."
Regardless of problems with
accessibility, Patterson said the
University decided to sign a ten-
year contract with Google instead
of Microsoft last year after polls

When LSA senior Elizabeth
Mac was elected president of
the Michigan Association of
Communication Studies, she
was determined to improve the
MACS experience for its 400
members.
The purpose of MACS is
to assure that students inter-
ested in communications are
given the necessary tools and
resources to pursue profes-
sional development. One way
of doing this, Mac said, is by
offering their members access
to an undergraduate. peer
adviser.
"Our peer adviser has office
hours every week in the Com-
munication Studies depart-

ment to help students who
want help editing their resu-
mes and cover letters," Mac
said. "She also can assist under-
graduates with class selection
and Communication Studies
requirements."
MACS puts on a range of
events including workshops,
company recruiting visits,
networking meetings, and
rsume reviews. These events
are planned through members
of the executive board as well
as the Communication Studies
department.
"We reach out to alumni
and people who we consider,
awesome potential speakers
to coordinate a diverse port-

folio of MACS programming,"
Mac said. "We aim to cover
all different branches of com-
munications ranging from PR,
marketing, event production
and even journalism."
MACS has brought a multi-
tude of companies to campus
including advertising agencies
Campbell-Ewald and Mullen,
and this fall Leo Burnett and
Google will hold events at the
University through MACS.
Mac said that students of all
majors are encouraged to join
the club.
"We have had psychology,
sociology and even engineering
majors join MACS," Mac said.

Two new high rises to join
Ann Arbor housing market

Projects come on
the heels of Zaragon
West, Landmark
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
Landmark, Zaragon West and
other new luxury apartments
dotting the Ann Arbor skyline
have new competitors on the
horizon.
Connecticut-based Greenfield
Partners and Minnesota-based
The Opus Group are the two latest
real estate firms to jump onto
Ann Arbor's luxury-apartment
bandwagon.
Both companies sent reports
to the Ann Arbor Design Review
Board in September for the
proposed projects. If approved,
a 14-story luxury apartment
complex will be built on the
northeast corner of East Huron
and North Division streets, and
another 14-story complex will
be constructed on Church Street
above Pizza House.
Ann Arbor currently hosts
multiple luxury complexes. In the
past four years, Sterling 411 Lofts,
Zaragon Place, Zaragon West and
Landmark all opened near the
University's Central Campus.
The two newly proposed
projects would come on the heels
of construction of The Varsity,
another luxury apartment
complex currently being
developed on East Washington
Street and slated to open next fall.
According to Sarah Tatum -
the regional sales and training
specialist for Campus Apartments,
a student housing management
company - The Varsity will
feature a two-story gym, sky
lounge and golf simulator.
Tatum said the prospect of two
additional apartment complexes
in the city will benefit students
because it will force management

companies to provide a better
product.
"In terms of it affecting The
Varsity, we enjoy the competition
and we look forward to setting the
bar in the market," Tatum said.
"We hope that students will really
embrace The Varsity when they
move in."
Brad Moore - the owner of
J Bradley Moore & Associates
Architects, Inc., the architect
for the Church Street project -
wrote in an e-mail interview that
while he can't discuss the full
scope of the project, it will include
"surprise amenities."
"I loved living in Tower Plaza
when I was a U of M student and
I'm glad that that type of living
experience is becoming available
to more and more students,"
Moore wrote. "I think building
vertically in the core areas of the
city is a more sustainable type of
development than urban sprawl."
Moore added that the process
of approving the construction
could take anywhere from six
to eight months. After the Ann
Arbor Design Review Board
holds a hearing on Oct. 17, the
project will be turned over
to the Citizens Participation
meeting before being submitted
to the Planning Department for
site plan approval at the end of
November. After public hearings
and internal reviews, the proposal
will be heard at an Ann Arbor City
Council meeting.
Sean Spellman, the vice
president and general manager
of the Opus Development
Corporation, wrote in a statement
that the company could not
comment on its involvement
with their proposed apartment
building over Pizza House on
Church Street.
"As Opus is working through
design, entitlements and
feasibilityanalysisofthis potential
development, we are unable to

provide specific project details at
this time," Spellman wrote.
Mustafa Ali - the owner
of CareOne Rental, Inc., a
management company in Ann
Arbor - said the growth ofluxury
apartment complexes in the area
doesn't concern him.
"I don't think that will affect
my business at all ... because of the
price difference," Ali said. "Their
prices are a lot higher."
Zaragon West is the most
expensive of the complexes, with
monthly rent ranging from $1,100
to $1,650. Sterling411Lofts has the
lowest starting rate at $800 per
month, but can run as expensive
as $1,625 per month.
Landmark, which was
previously owned by Campus
Acquisitions, was sold in
September to American Campus
Communities, Inc. along
with properties near 14 other
universities. According to the
company release,the management
company will invest $13.7 million
into improvingthe properties.
LSA junior Charlie Young
worked for Landmark last
year and said new apartment
complexes will benefit students by
driving down costs for other types
of housing.
"It's allowing those people
who can afford the higher-priced
luxury apartments to get closer to
campus," Young said. "For the rest
of us, who have to pay outrageous
prices for crappy houses, it's going
to bring that price down a bit."
Nursing sophomore Sara
Murrin said though she isn't
interested in living in a luxury
apartment, she believes there are
plentyofstudentsatthe University
who would.
"People here have a lot of
money," Murrin said. "But I
wouldn't do it at all."

ALICE LLOYD
From Page 1A
dence Hall is currently under
construction, and South Quad
Residence Hall has been public-
ly announced as the next reno-
vation candidate.
University Housing Director
Linda Newman said the prima-
ry purpose of the renovations is
to enhance the University expe-
rience for students.
"Our celebration today is not
just about the building," New-
man said. "It's about our com-
mitment to students. It's about
providing facilities and pro-
gramming that help students
make the most of their Univer-
sity experience."
After a 15-month long reno-
vation, Alice Lloyd holds near-
ly 520 students and includes
renovated rooms, bathrooms,
community areas and learning
spaces. The hall also features
unique spaces for LHSP, includ-
ing a dance and fitness studio
and a gallery space.
"Each of the residence halls
has rich histories and tradi-
tions," Newman- said. "Alice
Lloyd is full of people with
artistic endeavor and gives a
place a totally different flavor."
Coleman said students and
faculty often take for granted
the impact of the namesakes of
the buildings, noting that Alice
Crocker Lloyd - who served as
the University's dean of women
1930 to 1950 - greatly influ-
enced the goals of residence
halls.
"She got it," Coleman said.
"She knew how to support
Michigan students and she
helped them succeed. Just as
individuals such as Alice Lloyd
shaped Michigan, so too has the
residence hall that bears her
name."
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president of stu-
dent affairs, also spoke at the
event and said she admires
Coleman's vision for residential
life.
"Walking in this building

makes me want to be a student
again," Harper said. "This is
home, where students make
life-long friends and where
they come to appreciate differ-
ent ideas, different cultures and
different personalities."
Nursing junior Amanda
Wenger, who spoke on behalf
of the Lloyd Hall Scholars'
Program, echoed Harper's
sentiments and spoke of her
experience living in University
residence halls.
"I hope that we can preserve
the heart of the old hall even as
we grow into our new space,"
Wenger said. "Lloyd has always
been a safe place for me. When
I remember college, this is what
I'll think of."
Kinesiology sophomore Bai-
ley Palladino, the president of
the Residence Halls Associa-
tion, also emphasized that resi-
dence halls are more than just a
place to live.
"These are the places where
memories and lasting friend-
ships are made, and Alice Lloyd
is conducive of that," said Pal-
ladino.
In an interview after the
event, Al Comfort, an area
maintenance coordinator who
worked on the renovations, said
the use of modern day technol-

ogy in the residence hall is yital
for students and sustainability.
"Bringing it up to the mod-
ern day with technology for the
students is a big deal," Comfort
said. "The old systems were get-
ting really expensive to main-
tain. A lot of the machinery now
is so much more efficient, it's
just amazing."
Comfort said all the Resi- 4
dence Life Initiative renova-
tions undergo three years of
work: the first to develop a con-
ceptual design, the second to
make blue prints and the third
to complete the physical con-
struction.
"As far as the planning goes,
we learned a lot from every
renovation," he said. "Every-
one pretty much went a little
better than the ones before.
We learned from our previous
mistakes, so (Alice Lloyd) went
really well."
LSA sophomore Laura Gos-
lin, a member of LHSP and
Alice Lloyd resident, said she
likes the hall's new amenities
and design that make it unique
to LHSP.
"It's got a nice feel," Gos-
lin said. "It really caters to our
creative community. I honestly
don't think I would change any-
thing about it."

Longtime voice of
the Red Wings dies
Budd Lynch, a veteran radio
broadcaster who spent more than
60 years working for the Detroit
Red Wings and became the team's
public voice, died Tuesday. He was
95.
Lynch, the hockey club's public
address announcer, died follow-
ing a brief illness at a Detroit-area
rehabilitation center, the team

was the longest-tenured employee
in team history.
"Budd Lynch was a dear mem-
ber of the Detroit Red Wings
family and legendary icon of our
community," Red Wings' owner
Mike Ilitch said. "Hearing Budd's
voice on the radio and over the
public address at Joe Louis Arena
was something that every Red
Wings fan looked forward to and
loved. His calm, friendly and dis-
tinguished voice was symbolic of
who Budd was as a person."
Lynch began his broadcast-
ing career in 1936 at a Hamilton,
Ontario, radio station shortly after
graduating from high school. He
switched stations the following
year and volunteered in1939in the
Canadian Army. Lynch served as a

automatic admission, and this
policy fills up 85 percent of open-

was then forced to compete for
one of the remaining spots, for
which race is taken into consid-
eration.
The justices will consider
most directly whether this sys-
tem is legal in light of the Gratz
and Grutter decisions. However,
it is widely expected that the
court will use the opportunity to
review the overall role of affir-
mative action and possibly revise
or reject the 2003 rulings.
Due to Proposal 2, also known
as the Michigan Civil Rights
Initiative, consideration of race
in higher education admissions
has been outlawed in the state
of Michigan since 2006. There-
fore, the Supreme Court's deci-
sion will not have any effect
on the University's practices
directly, but may resultin sweep-
ing changes for higher education
across the nation.
On the eve of the oral argu-
ments, University officials
weighed in on the future of affir-
mative action and its role in high-
er education.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman, who led the Uni-
versity through the Gratz v. Bol-
linger and Grutter v. Bollinger
cases and later championed the
campaign against Proposal 2,
said the University submitted an
amicus curiae brief to the court
reaffirming its commitment to
diversity in the classroom.
Coleman emphasized that
arbitrary admissions diversity
targets failed to adequately rec-
ognize the fluctuating demo-
graphics of college-aged youth.
"The demographics are con-
stantly changing, so it's inter-
esting to me the argument that
'Well, we somehow reached a
goal we had ten years ago,"' Cole-
man said. "But the demograph-
ics aren't the same as we had 10
years ago."
Coleman added that she
couldn't foresee a day when the
nation would be able to com-
pletely do away with affirmative
action policies, even if such pro-
tocols would no longer based on
race.
Residential College Prof. Carl
Cohen was one of the main oppo-
nents of the use of affirmative
action during the University's
struggle with the issue.
In 1996, Cohen released
findings from a Freedom of
Information Act request he sub-
mitted about the University's
use of affirmative action in
admissions. Cohen's information
revealed that minority students
received 20 points toward the
required 100 points needed for
admission, while a perfect ACT
score was worth 12 points. This
information formed much of the
basis for Gratz's 1998 lawsuit
against the University.
After the Grutter and Gratz
decisions in 2003, Cohen and
then University of California

Regent Wardell Connerly led the
campaign in favor of Proposal 2.
,Connerly had previously led sim-
ilar campaigns in other states.
Today, Cohen says the change
in the composition of the court
since 2003 works in favor of a
stricter reinterpretation of the
issues raised in Grutter. Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor - a liberal
jurist who wrote the majority
opinion in the 5-4 decision - was
succeeded by the more conserva-
tive Justice Samuel Alito in 2006.
Alito has previously expressed
strong opinions against the use
of affirmative action in higher
education.
"It's likely that Abigail Fisher
will prevail in some fashion, but
what fashion?" Cohen said. "Is
she going to prevail because they
say, 'no, you can't do that under
Grutter?' Is she going to prevail
because the justices decide Grut-
ter was bad medicine and get rid
of it?"
Cohen said the phrase "affir-
mative action" originated in the
1960s under Presidents John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson in
an effort to prevent government
contractors from using prefer-
ential hiring practices. He added
that the idea of using affirmative
action as "preferential" treat-
ment dates from the 1970s.
"There will come a day when
we look back on this race prefer-
ence with a little bit of embar-
rassment," Cohen said. "We give
preference based by race largely
out of white guilt. The minori-
ties have suffered so much
oppression over the generations
that we feel we should make
something up to them. I don't
think that justification for pref-
erence will long stand."
Cohen said his beliefs are
grounded in the principles of
equal protection outlined by the
14th Amendment and the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
"It's morally wrong to give
people more or less because of
the color of their skin," Cohen
said. "Good motives don't make
wrong acts right. And giving
presence by skin color by my
view is morally wrong, and a vio-
lation of the constitution, and a
violation of the law."
Philosophy Prof. Elizabeth
Anderson, a supporter of affir-
mative action, said she also bases
her opinions on the spirit of the
14th Amendment and the ruling
in Brown v. Board of Education.
However, she said she finds
some faults with the University
of Texas's 10 percent rule. The
goal of the policy, and one of
the chief points of contention in
Fisher v. University of Texas, is
to create a more diverse campus.
"The only way it achieves
diversity is by depending on de
facto massive racial segregation
at the K-12 level," Anderson said.
"If you think the constitutional
imperative of Brown v. Board of
Education is to give a license to
the states to practice racial inte-
gration ... You shouldn't have to
rely on de facto racial segrega-
tion at the K-12 level tojustify
racial integration at the higher
education level."

Anderson said she prefers the
holistic view of race as a factor
in admissions allowed by the
U.S. Supreme Court under Grut-
ter to the Texas 10 percent rule.
However, she said the outlook
for affirmative action in the case
is "very bad," especially given
that Justice Elena Kagan, a lib-
eral-leaning justice, has chosen
to recuse herself. Kagan previ-
ously worked on the case when
she was the United States solici-
tor general the Department of
Justice, creating a conflict of
interest.
Anderson cited research
findings that claim elite higher
education institutions that use
affirmative action doubled rep-
resentation of African-Ameri-
can students on campus. Half
of African-American students
were found to have similar
demographics to their white
peers, but the other half came
from poorer, less stable family
environments.
"African-American students
have a much broader experience
of the condition of Americans,"
Anderson said. "Even middle
class African Americans have
less access to sheltered neighbor-
hoods than equal income whites.
That's the direct product of mas-
sive housing discrimination."
She added that the value these
diverse students bring to higher
education institutions is not
about finding about the "other
side of the tracks," but about
showing the "future elites of
America" what life is like out-
side wealthy neighborhoods.
Rackham student Daniel
Hirschman, who is currently
working on a paper about the
University's affirmative action
practices between the 1960s and
2004, said the court's findings
seem counterintuitive.
The court found in 2003 that
the more "objective" system
involving formal point award-
ing was considered illegal in
Gratz, while the more subjective
evaluation of diversity from an
application was allowed under
Grutter.
"Affirmative action is only an
issue at a small number of selec-
tive universities," Hirschman
said. "It's a function of a fact that
you're trying to admit a smaller
number of students than are
applying."
Hirschman also questioned
the meritocratic idea that only
the most academically quali-
fied students should be allowed
to attend these elite schools. He
cited the long-standingdisparity
in SAT scores between races as
an indication that the test cap-
tured a racial bias, and therefore
race was needed to adequately
consider an applicant.
"I think there's an assump-
tion in a lot of the public dis-
course, the (U.S. Supreme Court)
debates as an example, that stu-
dents that deserve to get in are
the ones who are the most aca-
demically talented," Hirschman
said. "That's not how universi-
ties have ever worked ... How
do we define 'merit' in the first
place?"

LEVIN
From Page 1A
tion over the potential damage
that could be done to the prestige
of the American higher educa-
tion system if lawmakers fail to
allocate proper attention to the
institutions.
"It's an election year, we'll
make choices," he said. "This is
a year where we decide where
our priorities are. You want tax
cuts? (They'll) lead us to dras-
tic reduction in education sup-
port."
Levin said despite his fervent
support of Obama, he was dis-
appointed with the president's
performance in the Oct. 3 presi-
dential debate. He noted there
were a number of areas where
Obama could have easily chided
Republican presidential nomi-
nee Mitt Romney.
Specifically, Levin said the
president could have gained
leverage by mentioning Rom-
ney's tenure at Bain Capital, his
desire to repeal the Affordable
Care Act and what Levin believes
is an apathetic attitude toward
the middle class.
"I would have been much
more aggressive. And I would
have pointed out the contrast of
differences on positions," Levin
said. "(Romney) is a flip-flopper."

As the longest serving U.S.
Senator in Michigan history,
Levin said his years of experi-
ence in public life have given
him crucial insights, and he
expressed his firm belief that
disappointment serves a greater
purpose, as one failure may lead
to another success.
"One of the things that I've
learned is that ... not getting
something you had your heart set
on could turn out to be the best
thing that ever happened to you,"
Levin said.
The personal connection
Levin provided is exactly the
kind of experience that Ander-
son said the University's Detroit
Center is seeking to breach the
gap between politicians and
their student constituents.
Central Student Government
President Manish Parikh, who
moderated the event, said he
enjoyed discussing higher edu-
cation with Levin.
"It was an honor moderat-
ing the Town Hall with our
Senior Senator Carl Levin,"
Parikh said. "He's known for
bipartisan compromises (and)
he delivered once again bring-
ing the Champion Wolverines
and MSU Spartans together. I
couldn't agree more with his
assessment that Michigan's
Public University System is the
best in the nation."


GOOGLE
From Page1A
faculty indicated that Google
was heavily preferred. She
added that many students tad
already been forwarding their
University messages to Gmail
addresses before they decided to
contract Google's services.
Despite ongoing communica-
tion with Google, she said the
company's services still have
not met the University's desired
level of accessibility, according
to studies conducted by the Uni-
versity.
In response to the inadequa-
cies, Patterson said the Univer-
sity has delayed forcing people
to migrate to Google. She said
that of the three main prod-
ucts Google is offering students
- calendar, e-mail and online
documents - the calendar is
acceptable, but Gmail and docu-
ments still need work.
Patterson added that she will
meet with University Provost
Philip Hanlon on Wednesday to
ask him to bar administrators
and professors from requiring
students to use GoogleDocs.
After Patterson's speech, CSG
Vice President Omar Hashwi
asked her if the University had
provided Google with a timeline
to solve the accessibility issues.
Patterson said the University
will complete its tests on the
system and give Google a priori-
tized list of problems within the
month.
"We haven't settled on a time-
line, but we are definitely going
to give them a timeline," she
said. "Our preferred timeline
is 6 months, they're probably
going to push back on that and
say they would like to have more
time."
Rackham representative Pat-
rick O'Mahen, who authored the
resolution against the Google
migration, asked Patterson if the
assembly could view a copy of

the contract, but Patterson said
it was against University policy
to disclose it.
However, Patterson noted
that the contract was reviewed
by a committee of administra-
tors that included several high-
profile administrators such as
Hanlon, Chief Financial Officer
Tim Slottow and Ora Pescovitz,
the executive vice president for
medical affairs.
In his address to Patterson,
CSG president Manish Parikh
said students came to his weekly
office hours almost exclusively
to ask about CSG's efforts to
improve the accessibility of
Google's products.
"What I find unfortunate is
that I am unable to give (stu-
dents) a response," he said.
Patterson said she will attend
another CSG meeting to discuss
the issue in early November.
Following the, discussion of
Google services; the assembly
unanimously passed a resolu-
tion allocating $3,000 from
the CSG Sponsored Activi-
ties account to help fund a pep
rally on the Diag on Oct. 18, the
Thursday before the Michigan-
Michigan State football game.
Business senior Jeremy Kla-
ben, one of the event's orga-
nizers, spoke to the assembly
about the resolution. He said
the rally already has 800 con-
firmed attendees on Facebook.
Attendees can earn a point in
the University's H.A.I.L. app -
a recently launched incentive
program that encourages stu-
dents to attend sporting events
- and Parikh will also speak at
the event.
The assembly also unani-
mously passed a resolution to
add an internship program
within CSG, which assembly
speaker Michael Proppe jok-
ingly referred to as the "CSG
pledge program."
The resolution will become
part of the CSG compiled code,
ensuring that it will continue
for years to come.


HEALTH
From Page 1A

ized treatment plans take into
account the patient's unique
genetic makeup, drug tolerance
and other information in order to
determine treatment protocols,
as opposed to giving all patients
with the disease the same treat-
ment and waiting to see what
works.
She stressed that the con-
tinued success of UMHS lies in
innovating the diagnosis and
treatment of patients to better
serve their specific needs.
"The University of Michigan
Health System experience is the
outstandingcare we provide cou-
pled withthe way we provide it,"
Pescovitz said. " ... I believe the
future of medicine is in person-
alized medicine, and I believe
this future is being created right
here at Michigan."
To illustrate her point, Pesco-
vitz showed a video of Alexis,
Noah and Zach Beery, who were
treated at UMHS for Segawa -
a mood disorder that inhibits
motor skills and developmental
abilities. By personalizing their
treatment, Medical School Prof.
John Fink was able to success-
fully eradicate the disease.
Joe Beery, the father of the
three children, spoke during
the address and thanked UMHS
for pursuing the treatment plan

that cured his children.
"What you guys continue to
do is change people's lives, and
I hope that you see through this
story and other people's stories
that it's not just the connection
you make with the patient that
comes to see you like us," Beery
said. "It's the global connections
that connect across the globe. It's
a connection that you guys cre-
ate every single day."
In addition to highlighting the
personalized treatment, Pesco-
vitz said she was dedicated to
improving and continuing the
connection and communication
between all parts of the system.
"No matter what we do in our
daily work we all play a role,"
Pescovitz said. "Each one of us
impacts at least one of these
goals, and each one of our dots
is connected to our success as an
entire system."
Arul Chinnaiyan, the direc-
tor of the Michigan Center for
Translational Pathology, is
one of the doctors behind the
personalized treatment plans.
Chinnaiyan sequences the
patient's genome to discover
mutations and attempts to
match the mutations with prop-
er drugs for each individual
patient. Since beginning his
work in April, he has sequenced
genes belongingto 75 adults and
five childen so far.
In an interview after the
event, Chinnaiyan said person-
alized treatment can signifi-

cantly improve the chances of
a positive outcome for patients.
Medical School Prof. Michael
DiPietro said he shared Pesco-
vitz's optimistic vision for the
Health System.
"The way U-M is going to get
through (the economic down-
turn) is to work together to use
the talent and resources that
we have, like she said," DiPietro
said. "And how we are not only
goingto survive, but how we are
going to thrive."
Still, Registered nurse Julia
Morrissey said she was disap-
pointed Pescovitz did not men-
tion the nurses's impact on the
development of medical science.
"I don't think there was very
much positive input on the nurs-
ing effect, on the whole Health
System as a whole, Morrissey
said. "I think it is great that we
are doing successfully but we
are not a business, we are here
to take care of human beings
and as nurses that's what we
spend our entire lives doing."
Most of those in attendance
praised the personal anecdotes,
which showed the advance-
ments of UMHS. Registered
nurse Desiree Conyers said she
was moved by the speeches of
individuals that were positively
impacted by the University.
"It was so nice seeing the
personal testimonials," Conyers
said. "It was very heartwarm-
ing and reminds me why I do my
job."

Driving toward the future.
Driverless cars should be legalized, innovated in Mich.
n Sep. 26, California joined Nevada and Florida to become
the third state in the country to legalize driverless cars. In
part due to the lobbying efforts of Google, many other states
are also beginning to push similar legislation, though Governor Rick
Snyder cites budgetary concerns as the reason for the state's appre-
hension. However, this is a critical moment in both the history of the
automotive industry and in the University community. With demon-
strated competence in computer science, automotive engineering and
massive project deployment, the University is in a unique position to
participate in the progress of the car industry. As such, the University
should take advantage of this technological opportunity by collaborat-
ing with industry leaders to pass progressive state legislation legaliz-
ing driverless cars.

n Thursday, Facebook offi-
cially announced that the
site surpassed 1 billion
active monthly
users, which
means that
roughly one in
seven people on
the planet has
an account with
Facebook. It's a
truly remarkable MICHAEL
feat for a website SPAETH
that was created
only eight years
ago. Facebook
employees and users are complete-
ly justified in feeling proud of this
milestone.
However, a much lesser-known
social network has been experienc-
ing some modest growth of its own.
Cowbird, which has expanded from
5,000 users in January to nearly
20,000 users in mid-October, is a
social network that emphasizes
beauty and genuine emotion over
speed and constant connectivity.
Cowbird's stated goal is "to build a
public library of human experience,
so the knowledge and wisdom we
accumulate as individuals may live
on as part of the commons, available
for this and future generations to
look to for guidance."
Cowbird users tell stories with
a short body of text, ranging from
a few words to a few paragraphs,
a relevant picture and an optional
audio clip. The picture fills a large
portion of the screen, drifting up or
down along with the computer cur-
sor, and is sometimes accompanied
by the sounds of people's voices
or the sounds of the natural envi-
ronment in which the story takes
place. The audio and the motion of
the image often make readers feel
like they're physically present in
the story's location, moving their
heads up or down as they examine

the people and the scenery in the
background. In every story, the
auditory and visual combination
can be heartwarming, haunting or
absolutely mesmerizing.
The story itself is usually short
but powerful. In one popular story,
a father has a conversation with his
young daughter about how much
he loves her. Some stories reflect on
trips abroad, falling in love for the
first time, spending time with fam-
ily or brief descriptions of beautiful
moments in everyday life. Others
tackle weightier topics - the war
in Libya or the Occupy Wall Street
movement, for example. The stories
are short enough that they can eas-
ily stick in readers's minds, and they
often end with a phrase that leaves
readers pondering for a few minutes
- as the ending of a short story or
poem should.
Every time I visit the Cowbird
website, I'm deeply moved by the
time I logout. This is partially
because virtually every Cowbird
user is a good writer - right now,
prospective users have to describe
themselves and the stories they'd
like to write before becoming mem-
bers of the social network. But the
main' reasons that Cowbird has
such a powerful emotional impact
on readers is its simple design and
focus on common humanity - the
universal experiences and feelings
that we share in one form or anoth-
er. Facebook seems to be trying to
create a similar experience with
Facebook Stories, an advertising
campaign. But as @cowbird tweet-
ed shortly after Facebook Stories
was created, "Imitation is the high-
est form of flattery;)."
In an era when speed and super-
ficiality reign supreme, Cowbird is
a much-needed breath of fresh air.
While the college social scene is
often filled with hook-ups - as The
Statement examined last week -

Cowbird provides glimpses into the
toils and triumphs of genuine, loving
relationships. As many politicians
and pundits across the country focus
on trivialities and emphasize what
divides us during the final weeks
of the 2012 election, Cowbird high-
lights the essential human qualities
and experiences thatunite us. While
Facebook is a place to feverishly
check the latest updates, Cowbird
is a place to quietly contemplate. As
Melissa Bell of the Washington Post
wrote in February, "Amid the clamor
of most social media sites, on Cow-
bird everythingslows down. There's
no rush. With that kind of beauty,
why should there be?"
New social
network is more
than constant
connectivity.
I've written in the past that Face-
book has some beneficial purposes,
and I'm definitely not saying that
Cowbird should try to compete. As
Daniel Griffiths of Forbes Magazine
wrote in August, Cowbird "is the
antithesis of the Facebook model
of going big." But Cowbird has a
valuable role to play in the world
of social networks; it creates a ref-
uge for people who want to explore
the subtle beauty of life instead of
checking the next status update.
Particularly during the stress of
midterm exams and the heat of the
election season, it's nice to have
somewhere to go that so beautifully
reminds us why life is worth living.

Earlier this summer through a partnership
with the U.S. Department of Transportation,
the University began a year-long, $22-mil-
lion dollar "connected-car" project utilizing
wireless communication between vehicles in
transit. The goal of this project is to shift the
car safety model from the current incremental
improvements - better seat belts and air bags
- to avoiding accidents entirely. Whereas the
Google driverless car is a step toward making
each car safer, the Michigan project takes a
holistic approach by seeking to make the traf-
fic grid safer overall.
The University and Google already have a
record of fruitful collaboration. This history
includes the Michigan Digitization Project in
additionto the recent adoption of Google Apps
accounts for all students and recent alumni.
Google CEO Larry Page earned his bachelor's
in computer engineering at the University and
currently sits on its Engineering Advisory
Council. Google and the University have both
benefitted from this relationship by cultivat-
ing some of the brightest computer science and
software engineering minds in the country.
Similarly, Michigan colleges are also
regarded as having one of the best automotive
engineering programs in the country. With its
proximity to the heart of the American auto
industry, the University regularly collaborates
with many car manufacturers on projects.

Safety, as with all transportation mat-
' ters, is vitally important. More than 2.2 mil-
lion people are injured in car accidents in the
United States each year resulting in nearly
$300 billion in damages. Though Google's
fleet of automated cars has thus far impres-
sively logged more than 300,000 mileswithout
incident (besting the national average of about
one accident per every 100,000 miles driven),
nearly all of these tests have been conducted on
well-regulated courses or on the sparse roads
of Nevada. While more than a third of all fatal
car accidents are caused by alcohol-impaired
drivers, the majority of car accidents are still
caused by driver error. Although this certainly
underscores the need for cars to become more
aware of their surroundings, driverless cars
must show a statistically significant improve-
ment in traffic safety over human operators
before this is fully implemented.
According to a report released in July 2012,
Americans drive approximately 258-billion
miles each year. Any advancement in the
interest of making American roadways tra-
versed as safely and efficiently as possible is
important. Having the brightest and best-
equipped minds in the country at the nexus
of innovation and history, the University has
a special responsibility and privilege to usher
in the next era of transportation with the
most cutting-edge technology.

GUS TURNER I :
A circus of rhetoric

ROCHESTER, MI - On Monday, the
Romney campaign, led by Paul Ryan, vice
presidential nominee and Wisconsin repre-
sentative, had a chat with Southern Michi-
gan's most exuberant loyalists. Along with
a hefty slate of Michigan's Republican can-
didates and incumbents, Ryan gave remarks
at Oakland University's O'rena in Rochester,
Mich. The Thunderstix clapped, "U.S.A."
chants rang out through the cavernous hall
and the mere mention of "Obama" or "Biden"
drew a chorus of lusty boos. Yes, ladies and
gentlemen, with the general election reach-
ing its homestretch, there I was, right in the
belly of the beast.
Surely, though, this chaos was noth-
ing that a "proud hunter" like Ryan couldn't
tame. Indeed, for all the hype surrounding
his natural charisma and silver tongue, I was
half-expecting to be swept up in a whirlwind
of Ryan-ism myself. If there's one thing that's
difficult for me to take with a straight face, it's
political rhetoric. The cattiness, the baseless
accusations, the half-truths and unabashed
contradictions - whether it's from the right
or the left, I'm prone to dismissing most of the
vitriol as static. Would Ryan, though, with his
reported irresistible charm, stand alone as a
model of integrity among it all? Could he break
through my icy layer of skepticism?
In a word: no. By the time Ryan actually
got on stage, my old habits had already crept
safely back in. Whether it was inflammatory,
garbled or just plain uncomfortable, each
Republican hopeful that filed onto the stage
only pushed me closer to the edge of outright
political apathy. Kerry Bentivolio, a House of
Representatives hopeful for Michigan's 11th
District, stammered through vague ideas of
hope and American values. U.S. Rep. Can-
dice Miller managed to blame high gas prices
on "an absence of leadership in the White
House." My favorite in terms of entertain-

ment value had to be Don Volarics, whose
over-the-top hysterics mostly resulted in
awkward applause or dead air. I don't think
he has my vote for the House, but I'll definite-
ly put him down for "Most Likely to Have Pre-
gamed with a Box of 5-Hour Energy."
Of course, the common thread throughout
all of this rambling stemmed back to the faults
of one man: President Barack Obama. Pastor
Kent Clark lamented how the Lord had been
"banned from America" by the current admin-
istration. Pete Hoekstra - Sen. Debbie Stabe-
now's Republican challenger - criticized the
strength of our national security. Ben Bishop,
the tween son of Oakland County's Mike Bish-
op, was given a minute to talk about how his
generation wouldn't have the ability to pay off
the debts that Obama's spending would incur
upon them. Thank you, Mike, for sacrificing
your son in order to complete this three-ring
circus of a rally. Ugh.
I realize that the Republican campaign has
never been about winning votes through fair
play and ethics, but when Ryan and his cronies
are coming out with a holier-than-thou atti-
tude about the dirtiness of the political pro-
cess, how can you not feel like your intelligence
has been insulted a little bit? "Obama is criti-
cizing," Ryan said. "He's going from hope and
change, to attack and blame. We're not gonna
fall for that." What do you call what you've all
been doing for the past two hours, PaulIt's dis-
heartening, to say the least, that by the end of
the night, the only speaker who had said any-
thing with even an ounce of goodwill toward
the opposition was none other than Michigan's
own, Kid Rock.
"I strongly believe," he said, "that it's pos-
sible to disagree about politics without hat-
ing each other." That may be true, Kid, but
just be sure to let your friends know it too.
Gus Turner is an LSA junior.

n his 2009 book, "Letters to
the Editor: Confessions of a
Frustrated Conservative," Sen.
Jon Hubbard -
(R-Ark.) stated,
"The institu-
tion of slavery<
that the black
race has long
believed to be
an abomination
upon its peo- MARY
ple may actu- GALLAGHER
ally have been
a blessing in
disguise." The
quote reads like something from a
backward 1920s textbook. It seems
incredible that a man holding these
views can be seen as a respect-
able member of the community,
let alone be elected to represent
an entire state and make laws that
influence the entire country.
It would be easy to dismiss Hub-
bard's statement as the ignorant
opinion of a lone politician. How-
ever, Dr. Alford A. Young Jr., pro-
fessor of Afroamerican and African
Studies and chair of the University's
Sociology Department, believes that
Hubbard's statementreflects awider
problem. According to Dr. Young,
there's "something about this coun-
try that allows him to speak in this
way as a public official." He said "a
number of people feel safe and com-
fortable uttering sentiments that
they might have kept more private
in the past," because the idea that
we're living in a post-racial society
has taken strong hold.
I have to admit, as an upper-
middle class white person, there's
some appeal to the idea that slavery
had its benefits. It would let me off
the hook a little bit, especially with

the increase in white guilt that I've
been feeling during this season
of Columbus Day and Thanksgiv-
ing. Also, as Dr. Young points out,
it "affirms some sense of greatness
of American culture and society."
The idea that the United States is
so exceptional that people forc-
ibly removed from their cultures,
enslaved for decades, then faced
with immeasurable prejudices and
discrimination - even in the pres-
ent day - should be grateful for all
of the above because they are able
to live in America.
Now, I love my country and
believe those who live here are for-
tunate enough to take advantage of
the rights and freedoms that the U.S
entails. However, I find it hard to
believe that African slaves wouldn't
have preferred deciding for them-
selves when to leave their homes
and come to a new continent. Seri-
ously, in this country we used to buy
and sell human beings and force
them to work for us. We had to tear
the country apart to end slavery -
we hardly treated slaves as human
beings, let alone full citizens under
the law, for another full century.
These are the citizens that Sen. Jon
Hubbard believes should treat their
slavery as a "blessing in disguise."
Hubbard goes so far as to say that
African Americans must "under-
stand that even while in the throes
of slavery, their lives as Americans
are likely much better than they
ever would have enjoyed living in
sub-Saharan Africa." However, Dr.
Angela Dillard, a professor in the
Department of Afroamerican and
African studies, says, "the view
of slavery as a civilizing force for
Black slaves only makes sense if you
believe in their inferiority - not

only racially but socially, politically,
religiously and so forth. It's not driv-
en by fact, but by belief and biases."
Slavery is not
a "blessing in
disguise."
According to Dr. Young, since
there is a black man in the presi-
dent's office, many Americans
believe that racial issues must be
less prevalent than in the past. How-
ever, with an incarceration rate of
African Americans six times higher
than that of Caucasians and high
school graduation rates 20 percent
below the white average, the long-
standing consequences of racism
and slavery are still evident today.
Of course, this is America, and
one of the great things about this
country is that Hubbard has the
right to say anything he wants. It's
allowed. However, it's disturbing
that this view is held by people in
our country, particularly by the
people responsible for represent-
ing the citizenry and making laws.
As Dr. Dillard concluded, "Having
someone in elected office with these
kinds of beliefs and biases may be
perfectly allowable from the stand-
point how representative democ-
racy works, but it certainly doesn't
make it any easier for me to sleep
well at night."

Theatre de la Ville
to bring Ionesco to
Power Center
By TEHREEM SAJJAD
For the Daily
Over the past few years, The
Theatre de la Ville's produc-
tion of Eugene Ionesco's "Rhi-
noceros" has
been praised Rhinoceros
for its intuitive
and authentic Thursday at
personation. A 7:30 p.m.
famed French and Friday
playwright and Saturday
and drama- at 8 p.m.
tist, Ionesco is
considered an Power Center
iconic figure in From $18
modern litera-
ture. Alongside artists like Samu-
el Beckett and Jean Genet, many
regard Eugene Ionesco as one of
the founders of the Theatre of the
Absurd, a movement that empha-
sized the meaninglessness of life.
The Theatre de la Villa's Paris
premiere of "Rhinoceros" in
2004 received popular acclaim,
prompting the production to
provide international audienc-
es a taste of European theater.
This year, the Thietre de la Ville
ensemble brings Ionseco's emo-
tionally ridden and inspirational

play to Ann Arbor audiences as it
tours some of America's top ven-
ues.
As the director of the Theitre,
Emmanual Demarcy-Mota
approached the stage with his
contemporary designs and his
ability to elucidate challenging
art to audiences. In his interpre-
tation of "Rhinocdros," Demarcy-
Mota is determined to provide
U.S. audiences with a classic and
theatrical re-staging of the play.
A three-act play, "Rhinoceros"
is set in a small French town.
The protagonist, Berenger, is an
everyman slacker dependent on
alcohol, who lacks interest in his
office work as well as the society
and culture around him. In Act I,
a half-hearted Berenger witness-
es a rhinoceros running through
the town square, his fellow citi-
zens are appalled at the sight of
the animal. However, despite his
degraded persona at the begin-
ning of the play, as the story
progresses, Bdrenger's transfor-
mation is considered a true meta-
morphosis.'
"He's an existentialist hero,"
says Theater and Drama prof.
Martin William Walsh when dis-
cussing Berenger.
According to Professor Walsh,
"Rhinoceros" 's concept is what
makes it such a unique piece of
theater.
"The play is fairly simple ...

a very ordinary observation of
life," says Walsh. "(Characters)
are almost crushingly boringly
normal, low expectations, just
wanting to carry out their lives,
which makes them susceptible
to rhinoceritosis. It represents
a particular post-war position,
a totalitarian ideology," Walsh
added. "You're a normal human
being and suddenly a rhinoceros
passes by and you say, 'Oh, a rhi-
noceros!' but eventually there's
more and more of them passing
by and eventually you are turning
into one yourself."
"Rhinoceros" targets the
domineering features of social
and political ideologies and their
powerful grip over ordinary
individuals, whose identity and
intellect are extracted by these
notions. As Ionesco himself
stated, "People allow themselves
suddenly to be invaded by a new
religion, a doctrine, a fanaticism
... At such moments we witness a
veritable mental mutation."
The conformity on display
throughout the play complements
Ionesco's own personal view and
emotional response to the rise of
political paradigms such as fas-
cism and totalitarianism before
and during World War II. Viewed
as one of Ionesco's finest works,
"Rhinoceros" is regarded as an
enthralling piece of the Theatre
of the Absurd.

Blue wins 14-inning marathon
against U-18 Ontario Blue Jays

Michigan earns
win despite errors,
sioppy performance

By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer
New Michigan baseball coach
Erik Bakich and the Michigan
baseball team got their first taste
of competitive action at RayFish-
er Stadium on Tuesday, but no
one was impressed.
The Wolverines littered the
field with errors en route to an
unsatisfactory 8-5 win against
the under-18 Ontario Blue Jays in
a 14-inning _
exhibi- ONTARIO 5
tion. (To MICHIGAN 8
remain in
compliance with NCAA rules,
the extended game serves in
place of two seven-inning con-
tests.) Michigan's ho-hum effort
showed just how much prepara-
tion it needs this off season.
The Blue Jays maintained
a narrow 5-4 lead in the 13th
inning, but the Wolverines start-
ed a rally with luck on their side
to mark a four-run frame.
Sophomore middle infielder
Eric Jacobson advanced to first
base on a walk and second base
on a passed ball. Junior right
fielder Michael O'Neill tried to
sacrifice bunt, but reached on
Ontario's throwing error and
batted in the tying run.
The Blue Jays' pitching staff
handed Michigan the lead -
Ontario right-hander Sean Rat-
cliff intentionally loaded the
bases before sophomore Kyle
Jusick found contact, singling up
the middle.
The Wolverines capped the
night's scoring on a pair of bases-
loaded walks. But both bullpens
pitched poorly. Michigan hurlers
combined for a torrent of wild
pitches, six walks and a trio of
earned runs.
"The errors we made tonight
were unacceptable," Bakich
said. "That'll never be acceptable
because pitching and defense
win championships. ... I don't
think that was up to Michigan
standards tonight."
Though nearly every hurler in
the arsenal saw some time on the

home on Tuesday.

mound, two experienced right-
handers remained in the dugout.
Senior Ben Ballantine and
sophomore Matt Ogden were
both unavailable to play fall
ball. Ballantine is resting his
arm through the offseason and
will likely be the ace this spring
after tossing 74.2 innings with 41
strikeouts last year.
Ogden is recovering from a
mild injury after being hit in the
head with a baseball. Though he
rarely started last year, the Auro-
ra, Colo. native came to be a reli-
able source in relief. In his rookie
campaign, Ogden earned three
saves in 40.1 innings of work.
With last season's graduated
seniors, Michigan has a handful
of spots to fill in the lineup.
At this point, starting slots
are up for grabs, and a freshmen
trio - Travis Maezes, Jack Sex-
ton and Jacob Cronenworth -
looked promising in the infield.
"You can probably expect
some of them to step in," Biondi
said. "I'm not exactly sure which
role they'll have, butI think you'll

see them contribute."
But it's the veteran outfield
duo that carried Michigan to
the win over Ontario, notching
familiar numbers and creating
timely hits. Biondi and O'Neill
combined 4-for-10 with four
runs, an RBI and two walks.
The odd man out, however, was
sophomore left fielder Will Drake,
who remains inactive due to slow
quadricep recovery. He swung a
hot bat early and often at the start
of last season, but on April 11, he
buckled running down the first-
base line against Toledo.
"(He) needs time to heal and
needs time to get back to a hun-
dred percent," Bakich said. "He's
rehabbing very efficiently with
our training staff and he'll be
fine."
A few missing keys on the field
and a slew of mental mistakes
nearly led Michigan to its first
loss against Ontario in four years.
The Wolverines posted lopsided
victories against the Canadians
in 2010 and 2011, outscoring their
opponent by a combined score of

51-2.
But after its woeful exhibi-
tion performance, Michigan is
actively searching for a spark.
After suffering two-straight
injury-prone years in the bottom
of the Big Ten, a change is much
needed. Which is why the Bakich
and his highly touted staff hope
to give the team a lift with their
gung-ho approach.
"The new coaching staff has
been great for our program, a lot
of energy every day," Biondi said.
"I think it's something the whole
team has really welcomed in and
has really bought into their phi-
losophy."
Essentially, an exhibition
means little. But for a team in its
rebuilding stages, ready to climb
the conference ranks and take
home a title, it means something
a little more.
"It just gives us a glimpse
when we can turn the lights on
and play against another shirt,"
Bakich said. "We obviously have
a lot of things to work on and a
long way to go."

By DAVID WEINFELD
For the Daily
Erik Bakich's young son Colt
rushed onto the infield grass and
to his father's side, tugging on
the -first-year Michigan baseball
coach's pant leg. Bakich looked
down, smiled and spun Colt
around. Even though Michigan
beat the Ontario Blue Jays 8-5 in
Bakich's first game in Ann Arbor,
it was hard for him to maintain
his festive mood. Bakich wasn't
satisfied.
During the 14-inning exhibi-
tion on Tuesday, the Wolverines
made seven errors and had four
wild pitches. The Blue Jays, an
under-18 team that showcases
Canada's top young baseball tal-
ent, scored two of their five runs
off of the mistakes, helping them
control a lead until the bottom
of the eighth inning. In the third
inning, with a runner on second
base, a throwing error by fresh-
man second baseman Jacob
Cronenworth brought in Ontar-
io's first run. In the fourth inning,
the left side of the infield faltered.
Freshmen third baseman Travis
Maezes made a throwing error on
a softly hit ground ball. The next
hitter dribbled a potential double-
play ball to shortstop, where it
snuck through the legs of sopho-
more Dylan Delaney. Luckily for
the Wolverines, they escaped the
inning without giving up a run.
In the fifth inning it was more
of the same. A wild pitch and a
throwing error were charged to
junior right-hander Alex Lakatos.
Two more errors ocured in the top
of the 10th inning, one on a throw
by junior pitcher Logan McAnal-
len, and another on a dropped line
drive by sophomore second base-
man Eric Jacobson.
The sloppiness was a common
theme throughout the game. The
Blue Jays capitalized on Michi-
gan's litany of mistakes, scoring
two of their five runs on wild

pitches.
"We obviously have a lot of
things to work on and a long
way to go," Bakich said. "It gave
us a good idea of things to focus
on. It was tentativeness, and you
could sense it in batting practice
because it's our first game. Guys
are nervous, guys are anxious.
They didn't look comfortable or
confident. I could get that feel just
by their body language."
Senior center fielder Patrick
Biondi echoed Bakich's assess-
ment, saying that the Wolverines
were nervous and "played really
tight."
"In normal practices we have
been playing really clean baseball.
I think you can see it in some of
the young guys' eyes, and even the
veterans, that we weren't relaxed
and we weren't as confident as we
should be. It's just a matter of get-
ting those guys to come out with
a little more swagger and confi-
dence."
Despite their defensive woes,
the Wolverines were also able to
capitalize on the Blue Jays' mis-
takes, turning Ontario's - three
errors and four wild pitches into
four runs of their own, resulting
in four of Michigan's eight runs.
The Wolverines said they'll know
that they will need to clean up
their game, as the Blue Jays are
well below the average level of a
Big Ten team.
The veterans and the new-
comers have a sense of optimism
about the team and its future.
Bakich's methods and style have
meshed well with the Wolverines,
by all accounts. Bakich is focused
not only on this teams success but
on the program's future.
"The players are buying into
the enthusiasm and the style that
we bring," Bakich concluded.
"Our program will have an identi-

Berenson rests starters
to use younger players

NICK WILLIAMS/Daily
Freshman forward Justin Selman scored one goal and had another called back against Windsor on TuesdayW
Freshmen shine as
blows out ancers, 7-3

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan's three-man rota-
tion of goalies with either mini-
mal or no collegiate playing time
was supposed to be the storyline
for the No. 3 Michigan hockey
team going into its Tuesday night
exhibition game against Wind-
sor.
But that WINDSOR 3
story got MICHIGAN 7
quickly
overshadowed - it was the for-
wards who effortlessly stole the
spotlight in Michigan's 7-3 route
of the Lancers.
"It was good to get a game
under our belt where we're play-
ing against a team other than
each other," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "It was a good test
for our team."
Despite what the score might
reflect, it wasn't a smooth path
to the win, especially when the
first period started off shaky for
the Wolverines. Freshman Jared
Rutledge madehisdebutbetween
the pipes for the first period,
and in the opening moments of
the frame, senior forward A.J.
Treais' shot found the back of the
net.
But the captain's goal was
waved off and Windsor subse-
quently took control of the game.

Midway through the frame, a
Windsor shot from the point
was deflected several times
before finding, twine after being
knocked in from the left side of
the net with three seconds left on
a Michigan penalty kill.
Waved-off goals seemed to be
something of a trend for the Wol-
verines during the first period.
Freshman forward Justin Sel-
man eagerly celebrated what he
thought was his first goal in a
Michigan sweater.
"I think we missed some of our
best chances in the first period,"
Berenson said. "It wasn't easy. It
was a good game for us because
(Windsor is) a good team, and
they gave us a good game for half
the game."
As per Berenson's plan, each
period brought a new goalie.
Freshman netminder Steve
Racine entered in the second
period, along with a Wolver-
ine offense that finally found its
groove.
Seconds after receiving the
opening faceoff from' Treais,
sophomore forward Phil Di
Giuseppe brought the puck up
through the slot. He found junior
forward Luke Moffatt situated in
front of the crease and Moffatt
knocked it in to tie the game at
one.
Not long after, Selman found

the back of the net again and this
celebration was justified. And
after that, the goals kept rolling.
And rolling. And rolling - three
goals in the remaining five min-
utes of the second period.
The Wolverines were graced
with back-to-back power play
goals after Windsor was penal-
ized for too many men on the ice.
The first belonged to Moffatt,
who received a blast feed from
freshman defenseman Jacob
Trouba at the point, and the sec-
ond went to Di Giuseppe.
Freshman forward Andrew
Copp rounded out Michigan's
scoring in the waning minutes
of the second frame. He was
assisted by fellow freshman Boo
Nieves and Selman.
Junior forward Derek DeBlois'
two third-period goals continued
the carnage against the Lancers.
Though Windsor managed to cut
the lead to 7-3, it just couldn't find
the rest of the goals needed to
close the ever-increasing deficit.
According to Berenson, junior
netminder Adam Janecykwas on
the short end of the stick by com-
ing into the game's final stanza.
"(The third period), that's a
tough period to come in," Beren-
son said. "He hasn't come in in
two periods and then he comes
in and our team is laying back a
little bit."

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Six men clad in suits sat in an
aisle of chairs along the third
story balcony by the northeast
corner of Yost Ice Arena Tues-
day night.
Normally this wouldn't be an
anomaly, but considering the
six men are current Michigan
hockey players and five of them
combined for 108 points last
year, it was a little strange.
Most notable of the scratches
were junior defenseman Mac
Bennett and senior defenseman
Lee Muffle.
As captains, Bennett and
Moffie are two of the most vocal
leaders for this experienced yet
youth-laden Michigan hock-
ey team. They also make up a
defensive pairing that is expect-
ed to be one of the best in the
CCHA.
The choice to sit the six play-
ers stemmed from Michigan
coach Red Berenson's pre-game
decision to let some of the fresh-
men and more inexperienced
players see more ice time than
they normally would.
Sophomore forward Zach
Hyman, senior forward Kevin
Lynch and redshirt sophomore
Luke Dwyer also watched from
afar.
"We've got a lot of depth
on this team and I wanted to
see all our freshmen in the
lineup and all seven of them
played tonight," Berenson said.
"You know Lynch, Guptill and
Hyman and those five will be
back in the lineup on Thursday."
The decision also likely
stemmed partly from Wind-
sor's 6-1 loss on Monday night
to Michigan State.
But even against the lesser
Lancers, the Wolverines got off
to a slow start on Tuesday. But
after trailing 1-0 after the first
period, Michigan rallied for five
goals in the second finishing the
game with a 7-3 defeat of the
Lancers.
There wasn't a lack of leader-
ship for the Wolverines on the
ice, though.

McAtee, Wolverines top Oakland in physical home game

By JACOB PLOTNIK
For the Daily
On Tuesday, Oakland Univer-
sity made the short bus trip from
Rochester Hills, Mich. to Ann
Arbor and rolled in with a lot
of momentum. In their last five
games, all which were wins, the
Golden Grizzlies had outscored
their opponents, 19-2. But the
Michigan men's soccer team put
a halt to Oakland's hot streak,
winning the match, 1-0.
Michi-

Chaka MICHIGAN 1
Daley did
not coach the game from the
sidelines because of a leg inju-
ry he suffered earlier in the
day. Instead, Daley sat in the
press box while assistant coach
Tommy McMenemy filled in
on the sidelines for the injured
Daley. However, McMenemy
said that the team makeup was
not affected by the coaching
change.
"There wasn't really a ton of
coaching to be done," McMen-
emy said. "The plan is in place
long before kickoff."
Save a single shot by Oakland
midfielder Shawn-Claud Law-
son, the first half was all Michi-
gan.
The Wolverines had four
solid scoring opportunities by
the 10th minute, but couldn't
capitalize on any of them.
The Wolverines' attack came
to fruition in the 13th minute.
Junior forward T.J. Roehn set

For the rest of the first half,
both offenses cooled off and the
physicality of the game picked
up.
"Pretty physical game, on
both sides of the ball," McMen-
emy said. "If people are noticing
that the game on our end of the
ball is getting a bit more physi-
cal, then we're doing something
right."
In the second half, both goal-
keepers played well. Each team
had their fair share of face-to-
face encounters between attack-
ers and goalies, but in all cases
the netminders stood strong.
There were a total of 13 shots,
six of which were shots on goal.

Grinwis was challenged a
final time in the game when
Oakland midfielder Matt Dud-
ley was coming down the right
side of the penalty area. Grinwis
charged at Dudley, who booted
it right to the goalie.
A minute later, Grinwis
punched a dangerous ball away
through a crowd of players, seal-
ing the win for the Wolverines.
The Wolverines (1-1-1 Big
Ten, 4-5-1 overall) will travel to
Madison to play Wisconsin (0-2-
0, 3-5-3) in their next matchup.
"We're playing Wisconsin,

Jake Ryan defies definition

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
If you listen to his teammates
and coaches, Jake Ryan is many
things. He's been a skinny defen-
sive back in high school and
a sturdy outside linebacker at
Michigan. He's been called goofy
and a free spirit, simultaneously
a football savant and an airhead.
He's also a chocolate-filled lol-
lipop.
Try to follow: On the field, the
redshirt sophomore transcends
positions. He chases down pass
catchers in the flat and hounds
quarterbacks. He can run with
receivers and stuff running backs
at the line. Ryan's technique is
flawed, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke says, yet he makes fearless
plays on the ball. He errs often
and recovers nearly as often.
Off the field, Ryan is equally
elusive.
"Jake Ryan, I don't know how
to explain him," said senior quar-
terback Denard Robinson with a
chuckle. "You just got to talk to
him."
Sophomore linebacker Des-
mond Morgan agreed. "Jake is
Jake," Morgan said, laughing. "I
always make fun of him for being
an airhead."
Senior defensive end Craig
Roh tried a metaphor. "He's likea
Tootsie Pop," Roh said. "No mat-
ter how many times you talk to
him, you really never know what
you're going to get until you get to
the chocolatey center."
Meaning what exactly?
"I don't know," Roh said. "You
can't describe him, really. He's
like, I don't know, he's like smart
but dumb at the same time, but
he's also just random, just like,
'Yo,' randomly."
Of course. Maybe Chuck Kyle,
Ryan's high school coach at St.
Ignatius High School in suburban
Cleveland, put it best. Kyle can't
put a finger on it, he says. Ryan's
just a free spirit.
During his high school years,
Ryan had to be flexible. Ryan,
like the other members of his
football-playing family, didn't
develop until he was older. As a
freshman, Ryan was too small for
linebacker, so he played defensive
back, where he honed his skills

t FOOTBALL
Herbstreit: Blue has 'shot to get to Indy'


By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Kirk Herbstreit can't figure
out the Big Ten, either.
K Last weekend, before the
Michigan football team kicked
off its Big Ten schedule on Sat-
4 urday with a matchup against
Purdue, Herbstreit, an ESPN col-
lege football analyst, made waves
by picking the Boilermakers to
upset Michigan. Then he took
another leap forward.
"I like Purdue to win the Big
Ten outright - Big Ten champi-
ons, holding up the trophy and
going to the Rose Bowl," Herb-
streit said, speaking on ESPN's
"Mike and Mike in the Morning"
radio show. "I think Purdue is
now the team to beat."
Today, Herbstreit's pick looks


pretty stupid. Michigan routed
Purdue, 44-13, and the Boiler-
makers never even made it com-
petitive.
In a conference call on Tues-
day, Herbstreit once again admit-
ted his mistake and went on to
say that Michigan looked "out-
standing" in the game.
"(The win) gives them a ton of
confidence as they get ready for
the rest of the year," Herbstreit
said.
Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 3-2
overall) began the season ranked
No. 8 before losses to two ranked
opponents in No. 2 Alabama and
No. 11 Notre Dame caused the
Wolverines to fall from the top-
25.
The win over Purdue lifted
Michigan back to No. 25 in the
AP poll this week.

"If you watched them play
against Alabama, Air Force,
Notre Dame, objectively speak-
ing, I don't know how anybody
could be really excited about
what Michigan was doing in the
first month of the season," Herb-
streit said.
In terms of the Big Ten race,
which Ohio State (2-0, 6-0)
would have a stranglehold on
were the Buckeyes postseason-
eligible, Herbstreit called it
"wide open."
Herbstreit said he still sees
Michigan, Michigan State (1-1,
4-2) and Nebraska (1-1, 4-2) as
the frontrunners in the Legends
Division.;
"You would think those three
teams have a good shot to get to
a Big Ten championship game in
Indianapolis," Herbstreit said.

"Looking at that, you have to go
through who plays who where.
"But Michigan, based on
the way they played last week,
they've got a shot to get to Indy."
Herbstreit, an Ohio State grad-
uate, credited the coaching staff
for "letting Denard be Denard."
Senior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson had 24 carries for 235yards
against Purdue, passing just 16
times for 105 yards and a touch-
down.
"If you were to look at Michi-
gan last Saturday and compare
it to the first four games that
we watched them, it was a dif-
ferent team," Herbstreit said.
"For Michigan's sake, hopefully,
they're able to bottle that up and
play that way the rest of the year.
And if they do, they'll be tough
for anybody to beat."

Online comments
"I am very saddened at the attitude towards sexual relations, commit-
ment, marriage, and family displayed by the individuals in this article. The
'hook-up' culture and attitude is what has been a main contributor to the
decline in family values in soiety. s firmly believe (and hope that others
would agree and recognize) that sexual relationships are a very satred
thing that actually carry very serious and lasting consequences and should
be used within the bonds of marriage. Men and women may think that sex-
ual intimacy involving no commitment or monogamy makes one freer but it
only provides afalse and temporary sense of happiness."

Probably.

Mikaela is an Engineering senior.

There I stood. Dumbfounded, heart racing, face red. She
stared at me like I was a joke. I couldn't believe the
comments coming out of her drunken mouth. She was
just so ... ignorant.
Have you ever felt out of place, disconnected from your
surroundings? Have you ever had people stare at you like
you're obviously different? They look at you like they can see
through you. They snicker, stereotype and think they know
you better than you know yourself. If you share the same
feelings, then you're probably black and living in Ann Arbor.
Prior to coming to the University, I had always been com-
fortable in my own skin. Growing up as an Army brat, I had
never thought of my race as a limitation until I started col-
lege. .
My introduction to the University came in the form of
Summer Bridge, an academic program for incoming fresh-
men that serves as a "bridge" into college life. Though I con-
sider my experience at Bridge to be one of the best inmy life,
there's much that comes with the territory. Since the major-
ity of the students in the program are in-state, inner-city
black students, some people see it as nothing but affirmative
action - a way for the University of Michigan to pay its debts
to the black community.
I remember going with some friends to Noodles & Com-
pany on South State Street that summer. While explaining
to them how to order, I noticed the cashier looking at us out
of the corner of her eye. As I stepped up to the register, she
turned to me and said, "You guys must be a part of the Sum-
mer Bridge Program." I nodded, but asked how she knew.
"Well, my old suitemate was in the Summer Bridge Pro-
gram, and she was black," she said.
I could have been a returning student, or a kid here for
orientation. Though I don't think she meant it maliciously, I
wondered if I was theonly one who heard it. But my friends,
a lot of whom had encountered this form, of subtle Tacism

before, were unfazed by her remarks.
I encountered similar situations throughout my first year
at the University. In classes, fellow students would make
insensitive remarks about the black community, forgetting
I was there. When I went to the University Hospital for a
check-up, the nurse asked me what college I went to, despite
my maize-and-blue outfit.
For the most part, I ignored these comments. But on one
particular night, I lost control.
I had gone to visit one of my friends in South Quad Resi-
dence Hall. The two of us were laughing and talking about
guys we knew. My friend repeatedly used the word "nigga"
to describe the guys.
One of her roommates came in, a rich white girl from the
West Coast, asking why was it OK for us to call each other the
N-word when we got so upset if a white person used it.
I explained to her that we used the term as a way to
describe an ignorant person, but she couldn't fathom it.
She turned to me. "Well, if you don't want me to call you
'nigga,' you shouldn't call yourself it."
I tried to ignore the girl. She told me that I was from
Detroit (I wasn't) and the only reason I had been accepted
to the University was because of affirmative action. She
explained to me calmly that she felt that black students used
their "blackness" to get by in life and through college. After
this, she claimed that she wasn't racist.
I felt particularly combative that night. I felt the need to
defend myself. She assumed I had the same background as
other students she had met on the basis of my skin color.
The confrontation continued.
"Well, I'm sure you have financial aid," she said. "It's so
unfair that you get financial aid just because you're black."
The room was quiet. My friend left the room.
The girl started to put her hands on me, trying to force me
to listen to her. I don't consider myself a fighter, but some-
thing in me snapped.
"Don't touch me! You can get as loud as you want in my
-face, but don't touch me,""Isshouted. - - a.

*ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND
My entire body grew warmer and warmer.
"I swear, if you touch me again, I will drop you. Right here,
right now."
"Well, do it, since you think you're black and bad," she
screamed.
I tried to walk away. But the girl decided she wasn't done
with me and pushed me down the stairs twice. People came
out into the hall to see what the commotion was about.
"Get her away from me," I screamed.
She pulled me off the stairs again. But this time, I reacted
quickly. Before I knew it, my hands were around her throat.
She gasped for air.
At that moment, I blacked out. I remember only being
dragged outside by my friends, crying and screaming with
rage. It had to have been the grace of God that saved her life
and mine. She had gotten the best of me, but I had let her.
I find it funny that people categorize the South as a back-
wards-desolate area. I'm from the South, and I've never
experienced as much racism as I have in Ann Arbor. Though
I want to make it clear that the University of Michigan as an
institution isn't racist - I've never been made to feel out of
place by faculty members or by the University itself - the
people I encounter from day to day can make me feel com-
pletely disconnected from the rest of my surroundings.
The girl I fought with represents something more than an
isolated incident. She represents the lurking racism that the
black community in Ann Arbor experiences on a daily basis.
The worrying, the need to prove ourselves wherever we go,
the walls of self-defense we put up - all these are things I've
developed after spending a few years here.
To my friends, I am the oreo: the black-white girl who
never hung out with other African-American students until
she came to college. But to the rest of the University, I'm just
another black person walking the streets.

Aug. 29, 2012. Twitter has exploded with the talk of
vaginas. I scan an article that materializes on the
creen. A full-color photograph presents middle-aged
women in oversized vagina costumes protesting outside of
the Republican National Convention. In an accompanying
video, a twenty-something woman - a member of an abor-
tion rights advocacy group - rattles off a speech on how
she wants to "make some waves:" Extreme. Inflammatory.
"Trashy," I mutter, closing the tab.
Inan ensuing discussion with a friend, I think back to Oct.
3, 2011, when I stood quivering on the Diag, every muscle
of my body taut with anticipation, fingers clasped around a
brochure that read, "Is Abortion Genocide?" Behind me, a
massive display bared full-size images of abortions next to
graphic photographs of past genocides.
In a dramatic effort to shake 40,000 students out of their
apathy, I had initiated the display's arrival on campus and
was now prepared for the onslaught. Making waves.
What kind of woman dresses up as a vagina at a political
convention? The same kind of woman who brings an eight-
foot tall picture of a dismembered fetus to the Diag and talks
about genocide. However polarized our messages, those of
us with opinions on abortion tend to raise hue and cry in the
same rhythmic fashion.
I am no stranger to activism. As last year's president of
Students for Life, I have often branded myself as the resident
pro-lifer in campus discussions and activities.
In March 2011, I attended a Planned Parenthood protest
on the Diag in response to the House of Representative's
defunding of the organization. About 150 pro-choicers from
the area gathered in pink t-shirts, sporting pink stickers and
carrying pink signs, all of which said, "I Stand With Planned

Parenthood," inviting a host of speakers to claim a podium
on the center of campus and praise the organization.
I perched on one of the cement benches behind the podi-
um, clutching a black sign that declared, "Women Do Regret
Abortion." When the advocates formed a line in front of me,
I hopped down, stepping through the spaces until I stood
before them. Shooting me venomous looks, they rearranged'
themselves around me.
We spent the entire duration of the event playing sign
wars: I hoisted my black sign high in the air, they attempted
to cover it up with their pink ones.
Following the speeches, the protest marched to Liberty
Plaza. I clutched the same sign, a piece of duct tape plastered
over my mouth as a symbol of solidarity with voiceless abor-
tion victims. Several of the sign-holders approached me, eyes
narrowed. "If you joined our side, then you'd have a voice,"
one girl sang out. I gazed back at her, my face stone.
Next to her, a guy finished his slew of f-bombs with the
biting remark, "You have no right to talk about women's
rights." This comment raised my eyebrows. "That's right,"
he sneered.
This battle of philosophical opposites has defined my
Michigan experience.
But this August, I attended LeaderShape, a University-
sponsored camp that strives to implement change and com-
munity action. Late into the week, we labored over our
"visions," hypothetical newspaper headlines of what our
worlds would look like in an ideal situation. "Zero Abortions
Over Past Year" mine proudly declared. I braced myself for
another outcry. When we finished, the facilitators hung up
our posters, and we strolled around the room in silence, read-
ing the descriptions and posting feedback on sticky notes.,

The experience surprised me, partly because of the affable
nature of the sticky note comments, but primarily because
the vision-reading opened the door to further dialogue about
abortion. Far more common ground existed than I had real-
ized, leading one facilitator to encourage me tq "get out of my
wheelhouse and look for allies."
So I did. I returned to campus eager to collaborate with
the Ginsberg Center to give resources to women strug-
gling with pregnancy. I found my inbox stacked with
questions about abortion from peers across the political
spectrum. Discussions back on campus slowly began to
shift my approach to activism.
Perhaps because the activist in me is weathered, I am
growing impatient for the day that University students can
sit around a table and engage in discourse about the hard
issues without retreating to political jargon. I don't condemn
the Diag activism I have witnessed or initiated, but my hun-
ger for dialogue warrants an appeal for both parties to seek
common ground and move forward.
Maybe instead of greeting the Diag walker with, "Let me
tell you about abortion," it begins with, "Tell me what you
think about abortion," imaginary duct tape sealing our lips
so we can listen. Something needs to defibrillate a conversa-
tion so hopelessly diluted in words thathave fallen limp from
their meaning: war on women, preborn rights, whoever talks
the loudest wins in the endless oratory cycle of our parents'
generation.
Maybe the loudest voices don't create seismic waves.
Maybe the best dialogue doesn't emerge from our own opin-
ions. Maybe conviction itself is born from the hollow womb
of silence.

It's On: Professors accept the challenge to teach sex at the 'U'
By Haley Goldberg

What do an expert on South American freshwater
fishes, asex therapist and a classroom of 230 under-
graduate students shouting "penis" and "vagina"
have in common? Last winter, they were all part ofthe Biology
116 course Biology of Sex, one of many courses at the Univer-
sity that discusses sex, sexuality and the academics behind
gettin' it on.
In an office buried deep in the back hallways of the Muse-
um of Natural History, Prof. William Fink, who is also a
curator at the University's Museum of Zoology and known
for his work with fishes, sits at a desk near a shelf of books
with titles related to human sexuality, love and evolution.
Fink said he, uh, conceived the Biology of Sex course in
2008 with Sallie Foley, an adjunct faculty member in the
School of Social Work, a certified sex therapist and director
of the University's Sexual Health Certificate Program. The
pair met through their sons, who attended the same middle
school.
Fink's work focuses on evolutionary biology and diversity
of sex in animals, and he thought partnering with a special-
ist in human sex and biology could create a unique experi-
ence for non-science students.
"For me," Fink said, "it's an evolutionary biology course
and a biodiversity course, but it also is a course that helps
people in their late teens and early 20s try to understand
what's going on in their minds and their bodies."
For many of his students, Fink said the idea of sex biology
and evolution is a foreign concept.
"I start the class by telling them they are the results of
three and a half billion years of successful reproduction,"
Fink said. "(It) puts a framework around all of our behavior,
and most people don't know that. They think dinner and a
movie is about dinner and a movie, but it's about babies - it's
about making babies."
Discussing "baby making" in an academic setting, how-
ever, does come with different rules.
The topic of sex education has been a controversial one,
with politicians and parents trying to control what is appro-
priate for adolescents and teens. While most institutions of
higher education have no formal regulations on this topic,
outside pressure from politicians and the media make teach-
ing a university sex course different from teaching a course
on, say, astronomy.
An act of indecency, or academia?a
The date is Feb. 28, 2011. It's after lecture ina Northwest-
ern University human sexuality course, and the professor
has brought in two guest speakers - a man and a woman -
for an optional demonstration for students.
The woman undresses in front of an audience of about 100
students, and the two speakers engage in a sex toy demon-
stration. The woman lets the man, who is her fiance, "pen-
etrate her with a device that looks like a machine-powered
saw with a phallic object instead of a blade," according to a
Chicago Tribune article on the class. She orgasms, and the
after-class demonstration is followed by a discussion on
"kinky sex and female orgasm."
So that's the same as an astronomy class heading outside
at nighttQoview the stars in acton, r ghtThe event launched
a medja asm. -

While Northwestern initially stood by the professor's
decision to show the exhibition, they later launched an
investigation of the event, with Northwestern President
Morton Schapiro denouncing the demonstration.
In a statement to the Chicago Tribune, the psychology
professor who taught the course, J. Michael Bailey, said he
couldn't think of a reason not to show the demonstration to
students, as his course focuses on "controversial and unusual
aspects of sexuality."
To show or not to show? That is the question
The expanse of sex education at the University is evi-
dent in the courses provided to students. One simple search
of "sex" in the Fall 2012 LSA Course Guide produces 167
results, with the departments offering these courses ranging
from Arabic, Armenian, Persian; Turkish, and Islamic Stud-
ies; Afroamerican & African Studies; American Culture; and
Communication Studies.
One course that appears, a Comparative Literature
class entitled Sexual Revolution, trades in Fink's biological
approach to sex for a political framework. Rackham student
Rostom Mesli teaches this first-year writing requirement
course, which he said offers a view of how sex is considered
revolutionary.
Mesli guides his students in analyzing the role of sex
duringthe AIDS epidemic, civil rights movement and other
key political moments in history. With a full class of 18 stu-
dents, mostly comprised of freshmen, Mesli said he has
to consider the academic validity in the texts he brings to
class.
"When I assign a text like the 'Myth of the Vaginal
Orgasm' or when I assign a text, say, about masochist prac-
tices or coprophilia (a sexual fetish involving feces), I need
to think twice about what I'm doing," Mesli said. "Students'
feelings might be offended, and that's something I need to
take into account."
Mesli initially said he doesn't feel pressure from the Uni-
versity to censor the materials he brings into class.
But then he paused and reconsidered his stance.
Any pressure he feels about his curriculum, according to
Mesli, doesn't come from the University or his department,
but outside political forces and ideas regarding sex education.
"I'm not enjoying total freedom," Mesli said. "But as far
as the University is concerned, I think the University does
everything they can to give us as much freedom as they can
afford to give us. The pressure that I do probably experience
is more coming from outside the University than the Univer-
sity itself."
Mesli's ambivalence is emblematic of the struggle to
approach sex in an academic setting.
He isn't censored, but he isn't enjoying total freedom. It's
almost as if sex education sits in a gray area, where profes-
sors must self-regulate and justify their methods or risk
beckoning apolitical and media storm to the University.
Mesli said the actual incident at Northwestern didn't
shock him as much as the mediaand public's frenzied discus-
sion of the event did, adding that sex should be approached
like any other academic topic.
"When it comes to sex, we have to be extremely care-
ful," Mesli said. "If the goal is to show people getting off on

stage, then that doesn't belong to the academia.Now, if the
goal is to talk to students about female orgasm ... and you
want to show how it happens biologically, physiologically,
then I do think that a case can be made that it belongs in
what we should do."
When asked ifhe would show a similarlive sex demonstra-
tion for academic reasons, however, Mesh said he wouldn't.
The media frenzy that followed the Northwestern incident,
accordingto Mesli, is not something he wants to replicate at
the University.
"No matter how much I might think that this could be
academically useful in a certain class ... one of the things that
this (incident) does is make sure I wouldn't do it," Mesh said.
"And in a way, it's very cowardly what I'm saying. I should
say, 'Yes, I would do it. I don't care, I'm going to struggle.' But
no, I'm not. I'm not in a position to do it. I'm a GSI, and I'm
not a professor."
While Mesli is comfortable with the content he brings to
class, the idea that there are things he wishes to teach that
cannot be taught reveals an invisible censor unique to con-
troversial subjects like sex education.
And it raises questions about why sex education can't be
viewed fully in an academic light. You couldn't study a solar
eclipse without viewing footage of a solar eclipse. Yet a dem-
onstration of the female orgasm to study the female orgasm
is deemed "disturbing" by the Northwestern University
president.
We're not interested in titillating'
Fink said he doesn't feel any political pressure regarding
the material he presents in his "Biology of Sex" course.
His course, however, was questioned when he first sug-
gested it to LSA. They. couldn't understand what kind of
class a biologist and sex therapist wanted to teach.
"That was a little confusing to me," Fink said. "But when
we explained what we were going to do, they went ahead
and gave us the go-ahead."
Fink said the demonstration at Northwestern wouldn't
have academic validity in his biology course, and he feels
the amateur nature of the demonstrators, who he said were
in an S&M group, didn't provide value to the students.
"Every professor makes decisions about what's appropri-
ate in his or her class," Fink said. "And in my case. I don't
see any reason why I should bring in some amateurs. Hell,
I've got enormous professional resources here (at the Uni-
versity)."
For Foley, the class is not only a chance to make students
more knowledgeable about sex, but to also look at it in a
new light.
"People walk in and they say that when they tell people
they are going to take a course on sex, people laughed and
teased them," Foley said. "But after the first class, they feel
completely empowered to go back to those people and say,
'This is serious; this is interesting, and enlightening ...' It's
very important."
One of Foley's techniques to desensitize the students is
a shouting match involving the names of male and female
genitalia. Yes, they play the penis game.
But for Foley, getting students comfortable with sex is
only one aspect of the course. More importantly, it allows

students to consider pursuing scholarly work in the field
of sex research, whether as sex therapists, educators or
researchers.
"We're not interested in titillating," she said. "We're
interested in informing and helping people thinkcritically."
It's on like Donkey Kong
So how does Fink take 230 students and help them view
and analyze college students' favorite pastime academical-
ly? By starting with examples of sex from other species in
the animal kingdom.
"There's an amazing array of animal sex variety videos
on YouTube, and I use them because they're fun," Fink said.
"Second of all, they're really informative to help people
understand how their behavior compares to the behavior in
the rest of the animal world."
Fink said showing animals reproducing helps students
become more comfortable with discussing sex. When asked
if he extends his video examples to humans, Fink said he
doesn't feel the need.
"I don't show humans," he said. "To tell you the truth, I
think human sex is so readily available on the Internet that I
don't need to do that. What I do need to do is tell students the
stuff they see on the Internet is for the most part staged, and
that's not the way that most people do it."
LSA senior Christina Sbrocchi, who took the course last
winter, said Fink brought in animal parts to demonstrate the
anatomical differences amongspecies.
"We were talking about male gorillas' genitalia and peo-
ple would imagine that they would be verylarge, butthey are
actually very small compared to their bodies," Sbrocchi said.
Sbrocchi echoed that from the student perspective, the
content was viewed in a scholarly way.
"The only thing that was a little uncomfortable were the
STDs," Sbrocchi said. "But it was all very clinical in the way
it was presented, and I think it was all very acceptable." -
The course also discusses why sex is fun, and goes into
some detail about non-normative sex practices, such as
BDSM, but Fink said he doesn't feel the need to go into
graphic detail. For the most part, Fink said the course is
able to establish the sex education some students never
received.
"We have people coming from (foreign) cultures," Fink
said. "I had a student come to my office a few years ago, and
she said a bunch of her and her friends are taking a class
and never in their lives had they heard any of this stuff.
They were so grateful to be able to find out all the answers
to these questions they've wondered about since they were
little girls."
After taking the course, Sbrocchi said she walked away
with a new perspective on biology and sex, as well as a vari-
ety of fun facts to share about doing the dirty. She plans
to work as Fink's teaching assistant when he teaches the
course this winter.
"I think, frankly, a lot of students find out they don't
have to feel guilty about stuff," Fink said. "A lot of students
come in from cultural or religious backgrounds that say sex
or masturbation or looking at porn is really bad and you
should feel guilty, and by the end of the class, many of them
are relieved of that burden."
