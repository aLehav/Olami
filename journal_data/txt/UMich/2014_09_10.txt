Annual report placed
the University at
29th nationally
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
The University ranked 29th in
this year's U.S. News and World
Report survey of the nation's top
colleges, falling one spot since the
2014 rankings.
Released Monday, the report
named the University the fourth-
best public institution in the
country, trailing the University
of California, Berkeley; the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles;
and the University of Virginia.
On top of overall college rank-
ings, the publication also rates
specific programs. The Ross
School of Business was rated the
nation's fourth-best undergradu-
ate business school, falling from
the number two spot from last
year. The College of Engineer-
ing maintained its seventh-place
position in the ranking of best
undergraduate engineering pro-

grams.
In recent years, the University
has dropped slightly in the U.S.
News rankings. It was ranked
26th in 2009 and 24th in 2006.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald noted the University's
tendency to drop and fall on the
list by small margins, but said
these changes are not a significant
factor in determining its standing
as a top institution.
According to analysis by The
Washington Post, the University's
ranking has remained fairly sta-
ble since 2010.
"What's good for one student
is not necessarily the best place
for the next student," Fitzgerald
said. "There's just no number one
school for everybody, no matter
what the rankings say."
Fitzgerald added that some of
the University's main areas of
focus in building a high-quality
learningexperience are maintain-
ing smaller class sizes, facilitating
collaboration between different
disciplines and increasing fund-
ing for top faculty, further noting
there is a wide range of factors

University alum's
death sparks new
discussions
By MAX RADWIN
DailyStaffReporter
This July, University alum
Josh Levine, a former football
team manager, unconscious in

a Wicker Park neighborhood
from an overdose of Adderall
and alcohol, and later died in
intensive care, the Detroit Free
Press reported Friday.
University officials said
Levine's story is not unique
when it comes to mixinguppers
and downers. College students
often take other drugs, spe-
cifically amphetamines, while
drinking.

According to the 2013 Stu-
dent Life Survey conducted
every other year by the Univer-
sity Substance Abuse Research
Center, 9.3 percent of students
use non-prescribed stimulant
medications like Adderall or
Ritalin. That figure has gone
up every year since 2003, when
5.4 percent of students reported
using non-prescribed stimu-
lants.

The University published a
news release Monday with a
study conducted by Monitor-
ing the Future, a University
research group in its 40th year
investigating campus drug
activity. The group found that
the nonmedical use of Adder-
all ranked second among the
illicit drugs being used in col-
leges across the United States.

U.N. spokesman Stephane
Dujarric said Mustafa and U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator
James Rawley released a new
appeal Tuesday for $551 million
for emergency aid in Gaza, up
from-the $367 million requested
in Aug. 1.
He said the assistance is need-
ed for food and basic supplies,
expanding access to health,
water and education, protec-
tion of the population and psy-
cho-social support. He said the
aid will be provided through
the government, U.N. agencies
and international and local aid
groups.
Dujarric said Rawley stressed
that the appeal is not a solu-
tion and called for fundamental
changes including a continued
cease-fire, the full lifting of the
blockade and a political solution.
Meanwhile, in Gaza, the
Israeli navy arrested four Pal-
estinian fishermen and seized
their boat Tuesday, a Gaza
official said, in one of the first
instances of friction between
the sides since the Gaza war
ended last month.
The incident occurred off
the northern Gaza town of Beit
Lahiya, said Nizar Ayyash of
the Gaza Fishermen's Union. He
provided no additional details.
The Israeli military said two
vessels were involved in the
incident. It said the vessels were
operating outside of their per-
mitted maritime limit, and after
ignoring requests to move closer
to shore, were boarded by naval
personnel and seized.
Israel and Hamas-led mili-
tants in Gaza ended 50 days of
intensive fighting on Aug. 26 and
committed to enter into indirect
truce talks in Cairo aimed at
developing a sustainable road-
map for the future of the dense-
ly-populated coastal territory.

Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, listens during a news conference Tuesday in Ferguson, Mo.
Ferguson city leaders plan to
reform afner police shootin

Review board set
to guide police
department
FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - City
leaders in Ferguson, where the
fatal shooting of an unarmed
black 18-year-old by a white
police officer sparked days of
sometimes violent protests, say
they will establish a review board
to help guide the police depart-
ment and make other changes to
fix the city's relationship with its
residents.
The Ferguson City Council
was set to meet Tuesday for the
first time since the Aug. 9 shoot-
ing of Michael Brown by officer
Darren Wilson. The shooting
exposed an undercurrent of
racial unrest in Ferguson and
other nearby suburbs in mostly
black communities of north St.
Louis County.
Changes the City Council
plans to make include reduc-
ing the revenue from court fines
used for general city operations
and reforming court procedures,
according to a statement from
a public relations firm hired by
Ferguson. Critics say reliance
on court revenue and traffic
fines to fund city services more
heavily- penalizes low-income

defendants who can't afford pri-
vate attorneys and who are often
jailed for not promptly paying
those fines.
"The overall goal of these
changes is to improve trust with-
in the community and increase
transparency, particularly with-
in Ferguson's courts and police
department," Councilman Mark
Byrne said in the statement. "We
want to demonstrate to resi-
dents that we take their concerns
extremely seriously."
The U.S. Justice Department
announced last week that it was
launching a broad investiga-
tion into the Ferguson Police
Department, looking for pat-
terns of discrimination. That
inquiry is separate from the one
into Brown's death, which a local
grand jury is also investigating.
Ferguson, a city of 21,000,
is about 70 percent black. Its
53-member police department
has just three black officers. The
mayor and five of the six City
Council members are white.
A 2013 report by the Missouri
attorney general's office found
that Ferguson police stopped
and arrested black drivers nearly
twice as often as white motorists,
but were less likely to find con-
traband among the black drivers.
In the last fiscal year, court
fines and fees accounted for $2.6

million, or nearly one-fifth of the
city budget. That's nearly twice
as much as the city collected two
years earlier.
ArchCity Defenders, a St.
Louis legalgroup that represents
indigent defendants, recently
singled out courts in Bel-Ridge,
Ferguson and Florissant as
"chronic offenders" among a
group of 30 municipal courts
where problems were docu-
mented.
In Ferguson, defendants
described a system so over-
whelmed by crowds that bai-
liffs would lock the door five
minutes after the scheduled
start time -then issue failure to
appear warrants for those who
arrived late.
Police have said the shoot-
ing of Brown came followed a
scuffle after Wilson told Brown
and a friend to move out of the
street and onto a sidewalk.
Some witnesses have reported
seeing Brown's arms in the air
before the shooting. Autopsies
concluded he was shot at least
six times.
On Tuesday morning,
Brown's parents joined about
20 supporters and activists at a
press conference outside police
headquarters to reiterate their
calls for Wilson's immediate
arrest.

Shark kills man in
Australia despite
rescue attempt
A shark killed a 50-year-old
swimmer Tuesday at eastern Aus-
tralia's popular Byron Bay despite
a beachgoer's brave rescue
attempt, police said.
Beachgoer Mark Hickey swam
15 to 20 meters (50-65 feet) into
the water at Clarkes Beach to
retrieve the severely wounded
victim, Police Inspector Bobbie
Cullen said.
The victim, who was identi-
fied by police on Wednesday as
British-born Paul Wilcox, 50,
received medical treatment on
the beach but did not survive,
Cullen said.
"A gentleman who was on the
beach went out and located the
gentleman and pulled him in,"
Cullen told reporters. "Absolute-
ly it is (an extraordinary act of
bravery) and we can only thank
him for his efforts."
Hickey, a 52-year-old lawyer
on vacation at Byron Bay, told

to try to rescue the man as the
shark attacked again.

RANKINGS
From Page 1A
that determine which school is
best for a particular student.
The U.S. News report is cal-
culated by weighing factors
such as undergraduate academ-
ic reputation, faculty resources,
selectivity, alumni giving and
financial resources.
Though a widely read source
for information regarding uni-
versity performance relative to
peer institutions, critics claim
the rankings focus too heav-
ily on faculty pay or new facili-
ties rather than financial aid or
diversity.
This year, The New York
Times released its own rank-
ing system via The Upshot, the
publication's data-driven analy-
sis platform.
Their version, released the
day before the U.S. News report,
rated the nation's "top economi-
cally diverse colleges" by using
an index based on the number
of freshmen who come from
low-income families and the net
price of attendance for low- and

middle-income families.
The list rated colleges with
four-year graduation rates
higher than 75 percent in 2011-
2012. The University's gradu-
ation rate in 2011-2012 fell just
short of that threshold, mean-
ing it did not receive a rating.
Only three public institu-
tions were ranked on this list
since the majority of large pub-
lic universities do not meet the
75-percent threshold. The trade
publication Inside Higher Ed
said many public universities
actually serve more low-income
students than their private
counterparts rated in the sur-
vey.
Vassar College topped the list
with a College Access Index of
3.1, followed by Grinnell Col-
lege and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Though the University was
not featured on the list, Kalam-
azoo College placed in the
top 15, while schools such as
the University of Notre Dame
and Northwestern Univer-
sity received negative College
Access indices.
Fitzgerald said the number of
University students who quali-

fy for Pell Grants has increased
in recent years, but the Uni-
versity has also been working
under the restrictions of Pro-
posal 2, the 2006 statewide bal-
lot measure that banned the use
of race - among other factors -
in admissions and was recently
upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
The University has ear-
marked $1 billion from the
ongoing Victors for Michigan
fundraising campaign for stu-
dent support, but tuition has
continued to rise in recent
years. In fall 2011, 63 percent
of incoming freshmen report-
ed family incomes exceeding
$100,000, according to the
University's Office of the Reg-
istrar.
University President Mark
Schlissel also made economic
diversity a priority in his inau-
gural speech Friday.
"It is imperative that we keep
tuition affordable and build the
financial resources that allow
students from across the full
spectrum of society to attend
Michigan, regardless of their
economic circumstances," he
said.

DRUGS
From Page 1A
According to the news release,
11 percent of college students
in 2013 indicated that they had
used Adderall in some way
without medical supervision in
the last 12 months.
The problem is that the Uni-
versity does not know how
many of its students are using
stimulants like Adderall simul-
taneously with alcohol or other
drugs, and there is no question
that specifically addresses it on
the Student Life Survey.
"What we don't know is how
many people that are abusing
this drug are also drinking,"
said Mary Jo Desprez, director
of Wolverine Wellness. "But you
can assume that there's a num-
ber of people that are mixing."
Desprez said some students
might take drugs like Adderall
and Ritalin while consuming
alcohol without the intent of
boosting their high. Students
prescribed the medication by a
doctor might accidentally take
it when they begin drinking,
unaware of how long the medi-
cine can stay in their system.
However, Desprez said stu-
dents also take it to enhance
their drinking experience.
"There's a narrative that

if you mix a stimulant with a
depressant, you can be a wide-
awake drunk," she said. "But
what they don't know is that
many people gauge how much
they drink on the depressant
effect of alcohol."
As a result, students could get
alcohol poisoning without real-
izing they had reached a level
of drinking anywhere close to
toxic.
"For example, passing out
can be a protective mechanism
that stops people from drink-
ing when they are approaching
potentially dangerous blood-
alcohol concentrations," said
Prof. Sean McCabe, who has
done extensive research on drug
trends among college students
for the UMSARC,inastatement.
"However, using prescription
stimulants while drinking can
potentially override this mecha-
nism and this could lead to life-
threatening consequences."
In addition, the synthesis of
mixing uppers and downers can
also cause long-term harm to
the body. Using amphetamines
while drinking has a history of
causing heart problems and high
blood pressure, Desprez added.
When asked about the num-
ber of incidents dealt with by
officers regarding the mixing
of drugs and alcohol, Univer-
sity Police deferred comment to
Desprez.

officials have been very proac-
tive in addressing the potential
threat and, so far, no Ebola cases
have been identified.
Fitzgerald confirmed that one
University faculty member had
been in Liberia teaching and that
one graduate student is in Nige-
ria conducting research. The fac-
ulty member in Liberia recently
left the country, but Fitzgerald
could not confirm whether that
decision was in response to the
outbreak.
Nationally, only four con-
firmed Ebola cases have been
treated in U.S. lhospitals, with
each patient being diagnosed
abroad before receiving spe-
cialized medical transport back
to a designated U.S. treatment
facility. An unknown number of
potentially exposed individuals
have also been transported from
the affected countries.
Tuesday, the U.S. government
pledged $10 million Tuesday to
train aid workers in West Africa
and support treatment efforts.
This makes the total U.S. contri-
bution more than $100 million.
Epidemiology Prof. Eden
Wells, associate director of the
University's Preventive Medi-
cine Residency Program, said
the involvement of U.S. aid
workers at this stage is primar-
ily motivated by the humanitar-
ian crisis, though government
officials have also noted the
long-term benefits of preventing
the outbreak from spreading to
other countries.
"These are employees of the
CDC and other organizations
that are putting their hands up

and volunteering to go," Wells
said. "That is humanitarian,
that is passion, knowing that
they are needed."
Public health researchers
are particularly concerned
over the exponential growth
of the disease. In an interview
with NPR Monday, Anthony
Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infec-
tious Disease, said almost half
of the reported Ebola cases
have been observed in the last
two weeks.
Wells said the best contain-
ment procedure is to prevent
contact between infected and
healthy individuals. However,
the lack of basic public health
services and stigmas about
registering for treatment in
the region has discouraged
persons from seeking medi-
cal care - the hospitals being
viewed as more dangerous
than home in some cases.
"There's a lot of fear," Wells
said. "When the locals are
becoming ill, they are return-
ing to their villages and places
they feel comfortable. Unfortu-
nately, that can leadto spread."
Case fatality for the disease
currently sits at about 50 per-
cent. However, early interven-
tion and supportive care - the
only treatments currently
available, as there is no vaccine
approved for human use - have
shown promising results. While
the death toll in West Africa has
topped 2,000 since the begin-
ning of the outbreak, none of the
four infected individuals who
were flown to the U.S. for treat-
ment have died. Two have recov-
ered and been released.
The disparity in public health
system quality also means that,
should Ebola be identified in a

U.S. hospital, it would pose a
much lower threat than in West
Africa.
"Yes, we probably will have
someone arrive on a plane (with
Ebola)," Wells said. "But we have
a public health system in place
that we could immediately iso-
late the patient and quarantine
anyone who was exposed, and
that's been quite effective. So we
would not see the spread or the
problems that we've seen in this
area."
The CDC haspublishedguide-
lines for U.S. health workers to
identify potential Ebola patients.
According to the report, an indi-
vidual must have a fever of at
least 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit
and have traveled to an infected

area within the last three weeks.
Overall, Wells said the U.S.
public health system has been
responding well to the precau-
tions, educating healthcare
workers and remaining vigilant
to the possible threat.
"We've had a few suspect
cases, but they tested negative,"
Wells said. "And that's just a sign
that our surveillance system is
working."
LSA senior Remy Tabano
spent part of the summer in
Ghana as part of a medical
anthropology program study-
ing the effects of gold mining on
child and maternal health. She
said she and her classmates were
aware of the outbreak before
leaving the U.S. after reading

media reports, but received no
official communications from
the University or CDC regarding
travel.
"I personally took precau-
tions to make sure everything
was okay," Tabano said. "I had
actually studied the virus previ-
ously, and I knew the severity of
the outbreak - and how unique
it was."
Tabano said she could not
accurately assess the situation
in the affected countries, add-
ingthat, despite U.S. tendencyto
refer to West Africa as a homo-
geneous region, the countries
involved in the outbreak all have
different public health systems

ings in other University Unions
across campus.
The airBus and AirRide res-
olution expresses the student
government's opposition to the
Detroit Metropolitan Wayne
County Airport Authority's
new agreement with Metro
Cab, which will restrict airBus
and AirRide to three parking
spaces in the motor coach sec-
tion of the airport parking lot.
"As a result of this agree-
ment, affordable bus services
are limited in passenger capac-
ity and passenger pick up and
drop off location; and whereas
it is the opinion of the authors
that this policy jeopardizes the
ability of services like airBus to
operate," the resolution stated.
AirBus is a CSG-operated
transportation service that
takes students to and from the

Detroit Metropolitan airport.
The cost to travel to the airport
is $7 while the cost to leave the
airport is $11.
Ann Arbor Transit Author-
ity's AirRide allows passengers
in Ann Arbor to travel to and
from the airport for $12 one
way and $22 round trip with a
reservation, respectively.
CSG President Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy senior,
voiced support for the resolu-
tion to maintain airBus and
AirRide's current status.
"This is one of the services
that students across the Uni-
versity know us for providing,"
Dishell said. "We really have
the opportunity to get people
behind calling the Wayne
County Airport Authorities
and saying 'no, you can't do
this.'"
Lustig agreed with Dishell
on the significance of the air-
Bus and its impact on students
who fly to and from campus
regularly.
"This is really an affordable

service that we bring to our
residents and something stu-
dents were adamant about hav-
ing years ago and that's why
CSG sponsors this. It's really
important for the student body
as a whole," Lustig said.
The resolution calls for the
creation of a UPetition against
the Metro Cab agreement and
its distribution to the general
student body. It also proposes
sending a copy of the resolu-
tion to Wayne County Airport
Authority, AATA and the Uni-
versity's Office of the vice pres-
ident of Government Relations.
Lastly, the legislation seeks
to have CSG members attend
Wayne County Airport Author-
ity's public meeting on Sept. 18
as well as their following meet-
ings, if necessary.
The proposal has been
referred to the resolutions
committee. The legislation will
be reviewed by the commit-
tee and then the assembly will
vote on the airBus resolution at
CSG's next meeting Sept. 16.

on to other Michigan Dining
orders, making it an economical
choice. Any produce that isn't
purchased in U-Go's stores will
go to dining halls or caterers.
"Eating well is not some-
thing that should require a car,
be seasonal, or be an economic
obstacle," Dishell said in a press
release.
He added that U-Go's conve-
nient location compliments the
affordable prices.
"Students are going to be
able to eat in a healthy way and
it's going to remove a lot of the
stress of trying to eat healthy
and trying to remain healthy
on campus," Dishell said in an
interview. "Students now have
the option to eat healthy at an
affordable rate."
Keith Soster, director of Stu-
dent Engagement, said U-Go's
would rotate the produce to
ensure that the fruits and veg-
etables are fresh throughout the
day. He said many students walk
through the Union on a daily
basis, so having fresh produce
available and accessible pro-

motes healthy eating.
Several other student groups
have also been making strides
towards providing healthy;
locally-sourced options for their
peers, especially underclass-
men who are most likely living
in University housing and don't
have cars on campus.
The Student Food Co., the
Ann Arbor Farmers Market,
MHealthy Farmers Market and
the MFarmers Market are all
hosting events throughout the
semester at various parts of
campus to help bring healthy
eating to the University com-.
munity.
CSG's initiative was designed
to cater to those students who
don't have easy access to access
farmers markets or grocery
stores, or who want to grab.

mitments.
LSA senior Colleen Rathz,
vice president of external affairs
for the Ann Arbor Student Food.

tant than just the nutrients.
"Promoting food and healthy
eating lead to students making
better decisions," Rathz said:

A full house
The 'U' should plan ahead for student overflow
This June, University Housing officials announced that
there would be several hundred more freshmen on
campus during the Fall 2014 semester than the initial
estimate of 6,000. By the beginning of the semester, Housing was
able to place the overflow of 423 freshmen into dorms by creating
brand new alternative living arrangements. According to Peter
Logan, the communications director for University Housing, the
University was able to open 337 spots for freshmen by offering
a voluntary housing swap to upperclassmen in one of four off-
campus apartment complexes. In addition, 86 freshmen were
placed into converted overflow lounge spaces. However, the
challenges faced during the recent housing dilemma should and
could have been avoided by proactive planning. The University
can prevent future crises by improving interdepartmental
communications and planning contingencies for inevitable errors.

The silent battle of women

Warm sun, good books,
boat rides and leisure
lounging cover the
painting of an
idyllic summer.
But a college
summer looks
a bit different.
It's filled with
applications,
mentorships and
internships. For
many, relaxed MAJA
summers are TOSIC
exchanged for
the privilege
of building reputations and con-
nections. This summer, I followed
my fellow Wolverines to a place
that inflates with interns during
the summer - Washington, D.C.
Together we exchanged our casual
sweats and yoga pants for awk-
wardly fitting suits and blistering
heels. As we rushed on the metro
and interned with various organi-
zations, we all gained a taste of the
workplace. But the taste Igot turned
sour and could not be rinsed out.
At first, I barely noticed it. The
guidelines that dictated a woman's

extremely powerful. As I entered

With only a few months to solve the
housing overflow before students returned
in the fall, the University quickly developed
an innovative alternative living situation.
The University contacted and then
subsequently signed agreements with three
local apartment complexes involved in
their Beyond the Diag listing service - The
Courtyards, Varsity and University Towers.
Later, Sterling 411 Lofts was also included
as an off-campus housing option. According
to a FAQ sheet about the contract offer
obtained from Housing, the alternative living
arrangement was then offered to several
hundred non-freshmen undergraduates. For
the price of a room in University housing, the
offer included rent, utilities and furniture
with the option of keeping or dropping their
meal plan. All provisions of the dormitory
contracts remained the same with no change
in obligations for students. When considering
the agreement, the University commendably
cooperated with students and landlords to
create an arrangement that comfortably
accommodated as many people as possible.
While the University was successful in
placing the extra students, it also diminished
the ability for movement within housing,
creating a potential for serious problems
this semester and the next. For example, in
training, residential advisors were told that
the number of emergency spaces would be
limited. Emergency spaces are critical as
they provide another room for residents to
move to when they feel targeted by other
hallmates or roommates. Reducing the
number of these emergency spaces limits the
solution set for situations in which a resident
feels uncomfortable within their own room
or hall. This is especially concerning for
young freshmen discovering their individual
identities and are learning to live with one
another for the first time.

This situation was created by a
miscalculation of the incoming freshman class
size by the University Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, an honest mistake, and some level
of variation between the number of students
admitted and those expected to actually enroll
is part of the system. However, honest mistakes
can be prevented with clear and constant
communication. Due to the unexpected
surplus of students this fall, and the necessity
for such creative solutions, it's clear that there
was a breakdown in communication between
University departments. It's problematic if
University Admissions solely provides an
incoming class size estimate for University:
Housing to accommodate. University Housing
should also provide the Admissions Officewith
an estimate of the number of beds available
in a given year so that Admissions can plan
accordingly. If University Admissions knows
that the University will have diminished
dorm space due to extensive renovations, the
Admissions office must keep this in mind when
offering acceptances to potential students so
as not to matriculate many more students than
available housing spaces.
Even though the predicament was caused by
anhonestmistake,thecomplexityoftheproblem
doesn't fit the scale of the miscalculation. An
additional 400 students to a 6,000 student
estimation is a 6 percent difference. It's
concerning thatthe University has such a small
margin for error, and that a seemingly small
difference in estimation can create a situation
that requires never-before-used innovations. If
these dormitory renovations are planned years
in advance, the number of beds should also be
known years in advance. Though this situation
isn't likely to repeat itself next year - with the
reopening of West Quad and Cambridge House
- it's important that the University install
a contingency plan that will hedge against a
margin of error larger than 6 percent.

At his inauguration, newly

Michael
Bloomberg, former mayor of New
York City, touched on the same sub-
ject at his commencement speech at
Harvard University this year, call-
ing student and faculty pushback
against figures like Condoleezza
Rice manifestations of "tyrannical
tendencies" that shut down dissent.
Bloomberg and Schlissel both men-
tioned the shouting down of Ray
Kelly, former New York City police
commissioner, at Brown University,
whose controversial affiliation with
racial profiling and stop-and-frisk
led to widespread protest.
Bloomberg and Schlissel -
Brown's provost at the time -
derided the behavior of students in
failing to let Kelly speak, describ-
ing these and other actions as det-
rimental to the free marketplace
of ideas on college campuses.
Without having our favored ideas
challenged, Schlissel argued, we
become intellectually stunted,
uncritical and a failure as students
and educators. President Schlissel
demanded that students be exposed
to differing ideas to see the other
side of any argument, even if the
other side is horrendous and despi-
cable. To illustrate, he described
an event in the '60s at which Ross
Barnett, segregationist and white
supremacist Mississippi governor,
came to Hill Auditorium. He was
booed and challenged by students,

the oldest Japanese film series in
America and, accordingto Nornes,

presented by the Confucius Insti-
tute at the University, a large step
for fans of Chinese cinema in Ann
Arbor.
Nornes is happy aboutthe ways
the University has been accom-
modating for Asian cinema in
the past, and is optimistic about
the possibilities for the future.
According to Nornes, his position
as Professor of Asian Cinema at
the University was also the first
of its kind in North America, a
springboard he's used to col-
laborate with the Asian centers
on campus to bring unique film
events to Ann Arbor. With this
inaugural collaboration with
the Confucius Institute, there
is potential for even more pos-
sibilities for future Chinese film
eventsi
"Because this is one of my
research specialties, I've often

been involved in the selection of
films and invitation of guests (for
Asian film events)," Nornes said.
"These included bringing one of
the greatest action stars of Hong
Kong cinema, and even inviting
the programnmer and filmmakers
of a banned film festival to show
their films in Ann Arbor. They
have always been exciting times."
While Nornes' professional
focus is typically on Japanese cin-
ema, specifically documentaries,
his expansive knowledge in these
two fields has helped him create
an exciting and thorough festival
lineup for Ann Arbor residents
interested in mainstream Asian
film.
"There is great diversity in this
selection, from arty action films
to straight ahead melodramas,"
Nornes said. "They are all in a
popular mode of filmmaking that
is really engaging."
Nornes noted that this engag-
ing style of film is not unlike
contemporary American cinema.
Similarities between these films
and recent American movies are
certainly present, whether this
was the intention of the filmmak-
ers or not. For example, the sec-
ond film in the series, "American
Dreams in China," is a fast-paced
business drama about college
friends with an innovative mon-
eymaking idea that propels them
into fortune and leads to endan-
gered partnerships. The film
quickly brings to mind David
Fincher's 2010 box office hit "The
Social Network," in both plot and
engagingcinematic style.
"(This style) mirrors the
diversity of our own cinema in
America, and Chinese filmmak-
ers tweak things according to
their own artistic, cultural and
historical sensibilities," Nornes
said. "Viewers with little expe-
rience watching Chinese film
will be fascinated by the echoes
they'll see between the genres and
approaches they are used to here
and their Chinese versions."

'Sons of Anarchy' drags
in season premiere

FX's motorcycle
gang saga is

tured while a +

dy" plays in the AnaWhy

son I cringed
and covered )X
my eyes this
time wasn't just out of sympa-
thy for the rival gun-runner. I
couldn't stand to watch Jax Tell-
er (Charlie Hunnam, "Pacific
Rim"), the supposed hero of the
series - the man who wanted to
change the gang for the better
and live a peaceful life with his
high school sweetheart, the dis-
senting voice and idealistic son
- pour salt in a man's wounds to
avenge a murder his poor victim
didn't commit.
It's frustrating to be a long-
time viewer of "Sons of Anar-
chy." As the series limps toward
its end, moments like this have
become more typical. That's
due in part to the fact that
there's more of "Sons" to watch
than ever before. The premiere
is 75 minutes long without com-
mercials and the show uses that
extra running time to insert

moreunnecessary musical mon-
tages set to classic rock covers
(the opening of the episode is a
five minute montage to "Never
My Love" that serves zero pur-
pose). The entire first half hour
of the episode could have been
cut with little consequence, as
most of it just reestablishes the
score from last year. Dragging
conversations are interrupted
with violence that only exists to
ramp up the body count, usually
at the expense of the women
and characters of color on the
show. This wouldn't be as much
of a problem if every female
character on the show wasn't
either dead, gonna die or a porn
star.
Gemma Teller (Katey Sagal,
"S Simple Rules") used to
be one of the most colorful
characters on the show, but
lately she's been=reduced to a .
sad caricature of an Evil Mom.
The injustice is evident in the
usually-great Katey Sagal's
performance, as she mumbles
her lines with little conviction
or interest. Gemma is walking
on eggshells after the murder
of her daughter-in-law last
season, trying to throw the cops
and Jax off her trail by passing
it off as an act of gang violence.
This could be good material, if
only Gemma's motivations were
more clear. Who exactly is she
devoted to? Why would she
allow the club she's so adamant
to protect fall into danger under
the leadership of her reckless,
grief-stricken son? Gemma is
an inscrutable witch in black
leather, the potential of a great
anti-heroine wasted with
poor plotting and halfhearted
performance.
Since everybody on "Sons"

is always so miserable, it's not
easy to find joy in watching the
show. I didn't write the pre-
miere date on my TV calendar
and didn't watch my screen-
ers until the last minute; not
because I didn't want to, but
because I don't want to see
how it all ends. It's inevitable
that the end is gonna hurt like
hell - I've read "Hamlet," upon
which "Sons" is loosely based,
and I've browsed interviews
and fan speculation about who
will die. (There's practically a
time-stamp on the bottom of
the screen, telling you that poor
Juice is episodes away from
meeting the Reaper.) But unlike
Shakespeare, which deals out
the pain and tragedy in a three-
hour play and five quick acts,
by the time it's over, "Sons of
Anarchy" will have dragged the
agony to 92 hours.
Despite the slow parts, the
most brutal moments of "Sons
of Anarchy" are viscerally
painful and point toward the
power of this show. Somehow,
these rough and rude men slip
through the cracks of their
poorly-written dialogue and
brand themselves onto your
heart like the SAMCRO tat-
toos that decorate their backs.
I wince my way through a
hundred musical montages
and lament the poor character
development of Gemma Teller,
because I hate that I care so
damn much. I'm harsh, because
I know "Sons of Anarchy" could
be powerful and good (if not
great) if it simply would get all
its shit together. And I know
I'm going to watch regardless
of whether it actually does that,
because I'm a sucker for misery
porn and I can't look away.


Daily in the Alley
up cycles art

Dally in the Alley is
like the laid-back love
child of the Ann Arbor
Summer Art Fair and Sonic
Lunch. Artists, musicians and
vendors line
the streets
of the Cass
Corridor
in Detroit,
winding
between
alleyways
and behind PAIGE
apartment PFLEGER
complexes.
Twinkle
lights are strung between build-
ings and across parking lots,
dangling over soundstages
and hand painted signs that
read "whatupdoe? Dally 2014,"
appropriately adorned with
rainbows.
The event draws an eclectic
crowd, from the local Detroit
hipsters to frat bros from Michi-
gan State. The performers and
artists that make the event what
it is, however, have one thing in
common: They create art that
fosters community in the city,
and promotes Detroit for what
it really is - a kick-ass creative
commons accessible to everyone.
"Dally has always been one
of my favorite events," Najah
Neimah, a Detroit resident and
University alumna said. "The
neighborhood comes together,
there's good music, great ven-
dors, and amazing food. I love
the pierogis," she added with a
laugh, "Gotta' go get some."
This is Neimah's seventh time
at Dally, but this year is differ-
ent. Instead of walking the rows
of vendors, she stands beneath a
white tent amongst racks of vin-
tage clothing. She's selling her
line of hand-picked clothes for

her business, Norah's Vintage.
Amongst the lineup of Dally
vendors, there were more vin-
tage stores and some clothing
vendors with a twist: print shops
that screen-print Detroit-centric
designs on T-shirts. Detroit-
based SMPLFYD carries stores
throughout Detroit and even
the U.S., like City Bird, owned
by a University grad, or Signal
Return in Eastern Market.
"We are really able to get our-
self out there to crowds that nor-
mally wouldn't see us," Justin
Fishaw, co-owner of SMPLFYD
said. "It's a very collective, eclec-
tic crowd. That guy has one of
our shirts on," he said, pointing
at a man walking by in a Tiger
t-shirt with the word DETROIT
stamped on the front.
Snap-back hats that read
"Detroit Players" and a shirt that
shows off The Supremes, one of
Motown's legends, hang from
the tent walls. He swats at a few
bees that are buzzing around
him - an infestation that is
pretty common for Dally. He
was stung twice last year.
A lot of Dally artists use
something less conventional
than clothing as their canvas,
like Kyle Dubay, who makes
home-decor out of reclaimed
wood found across the city
for his business, Woodward
Throwbacks. The table is scat-
tered with burnt wood coasters,
or placards that stamped with
"Motown," "8 Mile" and more.
Under the table are wooden six
pack carriers, equipped with a
handle and a bottle opener on
the side.
"They're all a little bit differ-
ent," Dubay said to a customer
eyeing the carriers. "Even the
handles, some of them are
broom handles, some of them

are pieces of railings." Though
the products vary, Dubay picked
each out of dumping sites or out
of the streets of Detroit.
Found
object art is a
popular trend
in the city.
Aubrey Smythe and his wife,
Elena, take found objects from
the city and repurpose them
into something new, whether
it be jewelry or a collaborative
painting. The Smythe's busi-
ness, Armageddon Beachparty
& Co., matches the vibe they
give off - bohemian style vests,
dreads laced with beads, and
necklaces of wrapped copper
wire.
"Everything we paint on is
from the streets of Detroit in
an attempt to clean up the city,"
Smythe said.
Not surprisingly, found object
art is a popular trend in the
city and at Dally. With Detroit's
historical buildings and neigh-
borhoods, a pile of bricks or bro-
ken glass could be considered
relics of a different time. That's
part of what makes the current
art communities in Detroit so
innovative - they are building
upon what most would consider
torn down, taking objects and
inspiration from the ashes and
arising to create the Detroit that
stands today.

With new surge in Liberia,
Ebola case toll above 4,200

Health workers at
risk while working to
treat patients
DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - A
surge in Ebola infections in
Liberia is driving a spiraling
outbreak in West Africa that
is increasingly putting health
workers at risk as they struggle
to treat an overwhelming num-
ber of patients.
A higher proportion of health
workers has been infected in
this outbreak than in any pre-
vious one. The latest infection
was of a doctor with the World
Health Organization treating
patients in Sierra Leone. The
organization gave no details,
but an American who became
infected while working in West
Africa landed in the U.S. Tues-
day to get treatment at Emory
University Hospital.
This is the second WHO staff-
er to be infected in Sierra Leone,
and the U.N. health agency said
Tuesday that after an investiga-
tion of the first case, staffers bat-
tling Ebola there now have better
working conditions - including
larger, more private quarters.
The outbreak sweeping West
Africa is thought to have killed
more than 2,200 people, and
public health experts agree that
it is out of control. More than
4,200 people have believed to
have been sickened in Guinea,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria
and Senegal.
The disease is spreading par-
ticularly quickly in Liberia,
where WHO figures published
Tuesday showed that more than
500 new cases were recorded in
a week. The organization warned
Monday that it expects thou-
sands ofnew cases in the country
in the coming weeks.
Sierra Leone said it is also
expecting to uncover potentially
hundreds of new cases during
a three-day nationwide lock-
down later this month. While
people are confined to their
homes, thousands of volun-
teers will go house to house to
search for those infected, Sidie
Yahya Tunis, a Health Ministry
spokesman said Tuesday.
Health workers in Liberia

have also paid a heavy toll; 160
have been sickened in that coun-
try, and 80 have died, accord-
ing to Karin Landgren, the U.N.
envoy to the country. Health
workers are at particular risk
because of their close contact
with the sick since Ebola is only
spread by contact with bodily
fluids of those who have symp-
toms.
Nancy Lindborg, a senior
USAID official, said a new
25-bed field hospital will be
dedicated to treating infected
health workers, though it will
not replace medical evacuations
abroad. The U.S. announced
Monday it would deliver - but
not staff - the medical facility.
"One of the limiting factors
in getting more health care
workers in is to provide them
the assurance that there will be
quality health care available to
them," she said. "This facility is
an important part of that."
A shortage of doctors and
nurses to care for these patients
is being exacerbated by the
sheer number of health work-
ers becoming infected. But that
shortage may also be the rea-
son they are getting infected,
experts say.
"The fact that people that
are highly trained are getting
infected is because the number
of cases is bigger than the bed
capacity," said Jorge Castilla, an
epidemiologist with the Euro-
pean Union's Department for
Humanitarian Aid. "When you
have too many patients, you
have too much to do, you get
tired and when you're exhaust-
ed, you make mistakes."
Staffing shortages have been
exacerbated by strikes, and
nurses and doctors have also
fled their workplaces simply out
of fear. Staff at a hospital in the
Liberian capital went on strike
this week; a local pastor called
the place a "slaughterhouse"
because it is not equipped to
handle treatment for Ebola.
Castilla said doctors face
the impossible choice between
turning away patients they don't
have room for - knowing that
they will continue to spread
the disease - and taking those
patients in, thus putting their
own health at risk
A
>er1t, 2814

That choice is starkly illus-
trated by the fact that Doc-
tors Without Borders, which
has been involved in Ebola
outbreaks for years, has never
recorded a single infection
among its international staff
during an outbreak. So far in
West Africa, where it is current-
ly running most of the treatment
clinics, six national staff have
been infected, but an investiga-
tion suggested none of them was
infected at work.
Castilla said the group's track
record is likely due to the fact
that they don't open more cen-
ters than they can properly staff.
While many facilities are
working with a fraction of the
staff they need, he said, Doc-
tors Without Borders adheres
to its rule that every caretaker
treating a patient enters the
ward with a buddy, who watches
the caretaker to ensure his suit
doesn't slip, for instance.
"If (protective equipment) is
worn properly, there is no risk of
infection," said Dr. David Hey-
mann, a professor at London's
School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine. "Unfortunately, in the
case of Ebola, a mistake can be
fatal."
After a Senegalese epidemi-
ologist with WHO working in
Sierra Leone tested positive for
Ebola last month, the agency
conducted an investigation into
how he became infected.
While the agency is not
releasing the results of the
investigation, spokeswoman
Nyka Alexander said Tuesday
that staff living and working
quarters in Sierra Leone have
been expanded to make them
less cramped and workers no
longer share living space with
other agencies.
Changes were also made to
working procedures, including
more temperature checks for
everyone coming into the WHO
office and living quarters, Alex-
ander said.
Michael Osterholm, a profes-
sor at the University of Min-
nesota who advises the U.S.
government on infectious dis-
eases, said while the infections
of two WHO staffers didn't yet
constitute a pattern, the cases
were worrying.

A bulldozer works on a flood damaged section of Interstate 15, Tuesday near Mnape, Nev. Flood damage caused the
closure of the interstate which is the main road between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Southwest fash flooding
closes interstate, rail ine

Seasonal monsson
and Tropical Storm
Norbert bring floods
MOAPA, Nev. (AP) - The
Southwest was mopping up
Tuesday after pouring rains
and flash flooding washed out
partofamajor rail line between
Las Vegas and Salt Lake City;
swelled a river so high that
a Utah national park down-
stream was briefly shuttered;
and closed a 50-mile stretch of
heavily traveled Interstate 15
when soggy pavement crum-
bled.
The cleanup began after
seasonal monsoon moisture
combined with the remnants
of Tropical Storm Norbert to
dump heavy rain throughout
the Southwest and set a single-
day rainfall record in Phoenix.
The sun was out Tuesday
in the small, southern Nevada
town of Moapa In Nevada,
where officials had feared that
rushing water would over-
whelm the banks of the swollen
Muddy and Virgin rivers.
"We saw it right at the cusp
and it didn't go over," said Erin
Neff, spokeswoman for the Clark
County Regional Flood Control
District. "It's a near-miss."
At least 30 homes in nearby
Overton were flooded, and Clark
County firefighters counted 18
rescues in the area, many involv-
ing submerged cars.
"I've been in this area since
1978. We've never had water
like that before," said David
Muns, a resident of Moapa,
where more than four inches of

rain fell in two hours.
Transportation officials said
a stretch of I-15 near Moapa
could be closed for three to four
days while they repair pave-
ment that crumbled into slabs
over muddy red dirt. One shat-
tered section stretched for half
a mile.
Traffic was diverted along
detours that added time and
miles for the 20,000 vehicles
a day that travel the highway
connecting Las Vegas and Salt
Lake City.
Truck driver Randy Garca of
Calhan, Colorado, said he hit a
standstill Monday afternoon
and didn't get rolling again
until the next morning.
"We were hungry so we
set up a- barbecue," he said by
phone from Cedar City, Utah.
Union Pacific Railroad ser-
vice was suspended while crews
repaired track near Moapa that
was undermined and washed
out by flash flooding. Officials
hoped to have the track bed and
rails repaired by Wednesday
for freight service to resume on
the busy LasVegas-to-Salt Lake
City main line.
In southern Utah, rangers
at Zion National Park turned
away visitors for several hours
Tuesday when heavy rain and a
surging river made park routes
impassable. Mud, debris and
a boulder blocked Route 9, the
road through the main canyon.
Wet weather also took its toll
on neighboring states.
Freeways in Phoenix became
small lakes on Monday and
rescuers scrambled to get driv-
ers out of inundated cars after
more than 3 inches of rain fell.

"We've never seen this,"
Mesa, Arizona, resident Greg
Montierth said. "Arizona deals
with sand and cactus and heat.
We're not set up for it so I can
understand why everybody's
scrambling at the last minute."
Cars also were stranded near
PalmSprings and inthe Coachel-
la Valleyin Southern California.
On an I-15 overpass in the
Moapa area, police officer
Shanan Kelly said he and sever-
al construction workers helped
rescue a woman who was swept
into rushing water from the top
of her minivan.
"It was very heroic and awe-
some," Kelly said.
Forty-two people were evac-
uated from a middle school
and high school in Moapa
and spent Monday night in a
building at Clark County fair-
grounds. Churches provided
blankets, and a store and res-
taurant donated food before
police escorted the people over
the damaged I-15, according to
Clark County spokeswoman
Stacey Welling.
About 190 people were evac-
uated from the Moapa Band
of Paiutes reservation after
tribal officials warned that
waters were close to breaching
a Muddy River dam. Officials
were assessing damage to prop-
erties with leaky roofs and wet
floors where water breached
flood control channels.
"We had rivers running
through people's yards. But
as far as property damage to
homes themselves, I think we
fared pretty well," said Sherryl
Patterson, administrator at the
tribal office.

Tentative deal reached to aid
bankruptcy recovery in Detroit

In joint court
filing, The city and
Syncora settle the
company's claim
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit has
reached a tentative deal to pay a
key creditor 26 cents onthe dol-
lar and offer it valuable leases,
a move that that could clear the
biggest hurdle in the city's plan
to reduce its debts and emerge
from bankruptcy protection.
A joint court filing Tuesday
evening said Detroit and the
bond insurer Syncora Guar-
antee "have reached an agree-
ment in principle" to settle the
company's $400 million claim
in the nation's largest-ever
municipal bankruptcy case.
Syncora spokesman Steven
Schlein told The Associated
Press the company would get
26 percent of what it's owed.
Detroit also would extend
Syncora's lease on the Detroit-
Windsor Tunnel by 20 years, to
2040, and give the company a
30-year lease on the Grand Cir-
cus Park parking garage, Syn-
cora said.
The two sides said they need
two days to complete the deal
and ask Judge Steven Rhodes
for a postponement of the bank-
ruptcy case trial until Friday.
"If this agreement is final-
ized within this time period as
we expect, it will profoundly
alter the course of the proceed-
ing and the litigation plan of

the remaining parties," the fil-
ing said.
Syncora attorney James
Sprayregen told the AP that the
postponement request was "so
that we can work through cer-
tain contingencies contained in
the deal, including obtaining full
resolution with Bank of America,
UBS and other stakeholders."
"We are hopeful the deal
will be finalized in the next 48
hours," Sprayregen said.
In response to a question
from the judge last week,
another Syncora lawyer had
told the judge that he thought
Detroit could afford to pay 75
cents on the dollar.
Syncora Guarantee and fel-
low bond insurer Financial
Guaranty Insurance Co. have
been leading a small group of
creditors fighting the plan by
state-appointed emergency
manager Kevyn Orr.
Orr sent the City Council a
request Tuesday to approve the
deal, according to a copy that
Syncora gave the AP. Reflecting
the legal limits on the council's
power, Orr said it would have
a week to present an alternate
plan to raise an equivalent
amount of money, and an emer-
gency oversight board would
make the final decision.
A message seeking comment
was left for Orr spokesman Bill
Nowling on Tuesday night.
Most creditors, includ-
ing about 30,000 retirees and
city employees, have endorsed,
Detroit's plan to cut $12 billion
in unsecured debt to about $5

billion.
Syncora has strongly
opposed the terms, saying that
Detroit's blueprint unfairly
discriminated against finan-
cial creditors. Syncora and
some other creditors have
pushed for the city to look
into the sale of assets, includ-
ing city-owned pieces in the
Detroit Institute of Arts.
The threat to artwork
prompted the creation of the
so-called Grand Bargain -
commitments from the state,
major corporations, founda-
tions and others to donate more
than $800 million over 20 years
meant to soften cuts to city
pensions while placing pieces
in the DIA into a trust and out
of the reach of debtor demands.
Pensioners this summer
voted in favor of Orr's plan,
which calls for general retirees
to take a 4.5 percent pension
cut and lose annual inflation
adjustments. Retired police
officers and firefighters would
lose a portion of their annual
cost-of-living raise.
For decades, Detroit paid
its bills by borrowing money
while struggling to provide
the most basic of services for
residents. The city, once fueled
by the massive auto industry it
gave birth to, shrank from 1.8
million people six decades ago
to fewer than 700,000 now.
The trial that began Sept.
2 is to help Rhodes determine
whether to approve, modify or
reject the city's financial reor-
ganization plan.

"I used to tell the trainers, I

When they finally did make

the team's trainers and his

sure he wasn't doing too much.
He viewed his mental

fortitude as key.
"You've got to set your goals
high," Butt said.
Still, he isn't fully in the clear.
Fifth-yearseniorlinebacker Jake
Ryan, who was covering Butt on
the play when he was injured,
suffered a similar diagnosis last
year and has given Butt some
tips for staying healthy.
One of the major pieces of
advice has been how to properly
celebrate. In one of his first
practices back from injury, Butt
jumped in the air and twisted
to celebrate a touchdown

reception, but was advised by
Ryan and Hoke not to do it again
because it is a common cause of
ACL tears.
Butt wore a protective brace
against the Fighting Irish but
said he felt fine. Regardless of
playing four snaps, he was just
excited to be back.
Tuesday, Butt , said the
tentative plan before the game
was to play more in the second
half to avoid getting worn down
early if he could play. But as the
Wolverines faced a large deficit,
coaches decided it wasn't worth

the injury risk.
Butt said Michigan's coaches
will decide how much he plays
this weekend against Miami
(Ohio), but, as always, he wants
to play as much as possible.
No matter what the coaches
decide, he can take solace in that
he isn't spending all of his time
where most assumed he still
would be: in the training room.

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSportsEditor
According to topsy.com,
a social analytics website,
the hashtag
"#firehoke" NOTEBOOK
was tweeted
more than 1,100 times in the
past three days and nearly 1,000
people used "Brady Hoke" and
"fire" in the same tweet.
All this coming after a 31-0
drubbing at the hands of Notre
Dame on Saturday.
Fans complained about the
Michigan football coach not
wearingaheadset, theysaid Hoke
should "bench (quarterback
Devin) Gardner" and that they
even "take Jim Tressel or Urban
Meyer at Michigan."
Hoke is clear he doesn't use
Twitter or social media. Not that
he's much of a talker in general.
But on Monday, he had to defend
himself after the first shutout in
program history since 1984.
"If they're truly fans, they'll
believe in these kids and what
they've done and the hard work
that they've put in," Hoke told
reporters. "If they're not, they
won't."
He's even got fifth-year senior
linebacker Jake Ryan, a captain
last season, backing him up.
"Fans don't see what we do at
Schembechler Hall, they don't
know what we do behind the
scenes," Ryan said on Monday.
"They don't know how much
work we've put in for this season.
"I'm confident in this team.
I have all the confidence in the
world in this offense and this

defense. We're going to step up
and this is going to be a great
season."
The overwhelming reminder
from Hoke and players is that
the loss to Notre Dame doesn't
derail their goal of winning a
Big Ten championship. What
it does do though, is upset a
fanbase that was already uneasy
following last season.
TUSSLE WITH TEXAS?:
Two of the most storied and
popular programs in college
football have both struggled in
recent seasons. So what better
way to keep a fanbase interested
than playing each other?
, Tuesday, the Wolverines and
Longhorns were reported to
be in talks to play a home-and-
home series in the next decade,
according to Anwar Richardson
of rivals.com.
Richardson tweeted: "Texas
and Michigan are currently
negotiating home-and-home
football series according to'
sources. Talks are going well
#Longhorns #HookEm"
Adding in a follow-up tweet:
"Texas and Michigan are
currently working on dates, but
it will likely be sometime in the
2020s #Longhorns #HookEm
#Wolverines"
The report comes weeks after
Michigan scheduled a home-
and-home with Washington in
2020 and 2021 and a home-and-
home with Oklahoma in 2025
and 2026.
Michigan and Texas have
met only once before at the
2005 Rose Bowl, which the
Longhorns won, 38-37.

BOLDEN KNOWS BEST:
Senior linebacker Joe Bolden
grew up playing football in the
back yard of oxford, Ohio -
home to the Wolverines' next
opponent, Miami (Ohio).
Bolden started playing
football in the Ross School
district in Ohio, 15 minutes
away from Oxford. It was close
enough that Bolden "could see
the lights from the stadium."
Growing up in the Cincinnati
area, Bolden is familiar with the
school that tried to recruit him.
And though he chose Michigan,
he knows plenty of players who
will line up against him on
Saturday.
"I have countless friends at
Miami (Ohio)," he said. "I got
guys I played with, guys I played
against at Miami (Ohio). A lot of
Cincinnati guys, obviously, with
Oxford being so close to so many
schools in the area.
"But it's a great feeling
getting to play against guys I
know, and guys that I've grown
up with, and really appreciate
and respect."

Forward broke out
with three goals
against Toledo
By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
It took Nicky Waldeck 366
minutes to score a goal equal to
her caliber.
The sophomore forward's
nine shots never got past the
goalkeeper in the Michigan
women's soccer team's
opening weekend against
Bowling Green, with her only
standout moment coming on a
79th-minute penalty kick.
Having made one start as a
freshman, Waldeck --who coach
Greg Ryan called the offseason's
most improved player -
attributed an uncharacteristic
showing to nerves.
"I had all the potential and
natural ability, but I didn't
know how to put it together yet,
as far as getting it to the college
game," Waldeck said. "I'm still
working on it, but I think that
I've come a long way since last
year."
She waited 12 more days.
After a weekend in which
the Wolverines suffered their
worst back-to-back losses
and dropped out of the top-
25 rankings for the first time
since 2012, Waldeck came out

of the gates against Toledo with
tremendous speed, the one
thing she and her teammates
have lacked lately.
Even after the game was
delayed due to inclement
weather, Waldeck was
unaffected, scoring within 70
seconds of returning to the
match an hour later. After
receiving a pass up the midfield,
Waldeck caught Rocket
goalkeeper Sam Tiongson off
guard 25 yards in front of her
net, sidestepped to the left and
drove in her first goal during
the run of play.
But Waldeck didn't end
there, finishing the weekend
with three goals and an assist
to preserve Michigan's perfect
record at home this year.
"You can see what she can
bring to the game: a lot of
ability," Ryan said. "She's been
struggling to express that. We
talked about with Nicky: don't
think about anything. Practice
is practice, just show up at the
game and play hard."
Tuesday, Waldeck added: "It
felt good to break that barrier
and have that weight lifted off
my shoulders. But I don't want
to get ahead of myself."
Much of the early season'
has been a mental game for
Waldeck. She described herself"
not as the player who needs to
care or work more, but instead
the one that needs to relax

more.
Waldeck believes in Ryan's
"practice is practice" mantra,
making sure to clear her mind
before each game. She manages
to keep practice and games
separate of each other, as one is
a time for making adjustments
and the other is for instincts to
take over.
Ryan says the weekend was a
nice way to get rid of the taste
from California - when his
team was shutout twice - but
Waldeck isn't ready to let past
results slide.
"I don't think our team is
one to look at that and say, 'Oh,
we're good now," Waldeck said
after beating Toledo. "Because
we're not even close. We got
beat 5-0 a week ago."
Thisweekend,theWolverines
(4-2 overall) host Minnesota
and Wisconsin. Michigan looks
to avenge themselves when
the Gophers, who handed the
Wolverines their only Big Ten
regular season loss last year,
come to town.
Sunday against Central
Michigan, Waldeck was
benched for the second half
with a sore foot. She declined to
comment on the "injury," and
it remains to be seen if she'll
be healthy enough to help her
team get a taste of revenge.
Now that she's woken herself
up, Waldeck could be the
answer to waking up Michigan.

Personal Statement: My quarter life crisis
By Mariam Sheikh

"So you're a freshman,right?"
I sit there absentmindedly in my
political science lecture, in my slight-
ly awkward GSI's office hours, in a
"mandatory" review session - what-
ever the location, that question is
always asked. OK - yes, I am sitting
in your100-level class,yes Istalk you
in office hours to ask a million ques-
tions, yes I sometimes appear to be
dazed and confused. Butno, I amnot
a freshman.
Instead, I'm here because I am
trying to ma another year, another
semester, an opportunity to take new
classes in search of a subject I genu-
inely like. That didn't happen as a
freshman.
But I am not a freshman anymore
and Istill don't know what to do.I am
in this middle phase of my life, sur-
rounded by walls - by the distinct
memories of high school and the dis-
tant idea of the rest of college. And
they are slowly corneringme in.
I remember it too well: the antici-
pation, the nerves, the senioritis and
most of all, the fearlessness. Just like
myself- not too long ago -there are
eager high school students waiting to
graduate, to turn 18 and venture off
to college. Then there are those who

I could have actually learned Ital-

required semesters) -but there sim-
ply wasn't enough time.I do have my
hobbies, but they are lackluster and
there isalwaysthe want for more.
I remember all of the times when
I said "no" to going out to stay in and
study for an exam that I ended up
doing average on anyway. The days
spent locked in my dorm or apart-
ment taking notes and reading pages
of textbooks. The times whenI didn't
even go outside so I could get more
work done. Where does it end? When
does it end?
The hope is that we work hard
now to get a decent career going, and
then what?We get rich,we retire, we
move to Florida and tan for the rest of
our lives.Oh,ifonly it were that easy.
In reality, we keep working hard
to keep that career going. To be pro-

not always the case. They call it pay-

you are middle-aged,thenpeople will
respect you and take you seriously. I
don't know about you, but when I'm
middle aged, I don't wanttohave just
started my career.
Turning 20 means that Iam clos-

THE VISUAL STATEMENT: KICKIN' IT IN TOLUCA
BY VIRGINIA LOZANO
S kateboarding has been an uprising interest in the city of Toluca, Mexico and its surrounding pueblos.
One of the main reasons for its recent popularity is the Zarape Skateshop that opened up in 2013. The
name Zarape refers to the traditional Mexican blanket, while the graffiti inspired designs on the boards
embody the modern culture of the country. Mostly teenage boys and young men practice this sport, a
demographic that contributes greatly to Mexico's high crime rates. As described by local skateboarder
Gibran Fregoso, "skating helps us take away the stress and frustration that builds up, leaving us wanting
to practice more, not looking for outlets like criminal activity." While skateboarding may not solve all
of the nation's challenges, it has had a positive effect on this growing community. Through hours of
practice, mastering new tricks and overcoming countless injuries, Toluca's skaters epitomizeFregoso's
belief that, "skateboarding is more than a sport, it's a fast-paced lifestyle of freedom."

How the new in-state tuition policy impacts international students
by Amabel Karoub

On Tuesday afternoon, Public Policy senior
Daniel Morales sat in Starbucks with his leath-
er-clad laptop in front of him. He seemed to
speak without breathing, flowing from topic
to topic as if someone might try to silence him
at any moment.
For most of his life, Morales was an undoc-
umented student. Born in Mexico, he came to
the United States illegally when he was very
young. Ifhe had not been able to obtain a green
card, he would never have been able to afford
to attend the University.
Morales leads the Coalition of Tuition
Equality, a student group that fought for in-
state tuition for undocumented students
- and won. As non-citizens, these students
cannot be considered Michigan residents,
despite the fact that many of them have lived
in Michigan for most of their lives and gradu-
ated from Michigan high schools. Prior to
changes to the tuition policy, these students
were forced to pay out-of-state tuition - a
whopping price of over $40,000 for tuition
per year. An in-state tuition far more than the
average rate of roughly $15,000 per year. Even
worse, these students were unable to gain
any sort of financial aid. Most need-based
financial aid comes through federal avenues,
and federal law prevents this aid from being
offered to non-citizens.
According to Morales, students have been
rendered unable to attend the University due
to cost, leaving the undocumented popula-
tion at the University at a total of about five
students.
"The vast majority of those accepted
couldn't come," Morales said.
The new tuition policy went into place in
January 2014 and offers three avenues for
gaining in-state tuition: Michigan residence,
attending Michigan schools and service in the
armed forces. The Michigan schools pathway
is aimed at undocumented students. As long as .
they attended two years of middle school and
three years of high school in Michigan, they
can receive in-state tuition, regardless of citi-
zenship.
This avenue is justified because students
who attended Michigan schools for five years
have also paid Michigan taxes for that long.
University Spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald said
the discounted in-state tuition is meant to
reward Michigan taxpayers.
"The out-of-state tuition more accurately
reflects what a Michigan education costs to
provide to a student," Fitzgerald said. "The in-
IWstate tuition is discounted because of the sup-
port that the University gets from the State of
Michigan as a public institution."
Although undocumented students can, as of
January 2014, apply for in-state tuition, most
still did not come to the University. Despite
the University's policy changes, federal law
still prevents them from obtainingneed-based
financial aid. For this reason, after the tuition

policy was changed, Morales said the next
goal was to find a way for undocumented stu-
dents to get on an equal financial footing.
Starting this semester, CTE has seen some
partial success on their second front as well.
The University set up a pilot program that
offers need-based financial aid to undocu-
mented students. The program will be in place
for the 2014-2015 year, and then reassessed
next year. The fund contains up to $450,000 to
be distributed. Fitzgerald said the reason this
aid is available to these students is because it is
not from a federal resource.
"It's all funds provided by U of M," Fitzger-

here a long time, but are not citizens. These
international students can now gain in-state
tuition if they attended most of middle and
high school in the U.S.
"It turned out that alot of people are bene-
fitting from this that weren't necessarily CTE's
intention," Morales said. "It's an unintended
consequence, buta positive consequence."
One such student is LSA senior Monica
Choo. Having moved to Michigan from South
Korea as a young girl, Choo considered her-
self a Michigan resident as she entered col-
lege, despite her lack of a green card. Choo
was deeply disappointed upon discovering she

nent residence status in the U.S., her mother
still had ties in South Korea. For this reason,
the University still would not give Choo in-
state tuition.
"They wanted a letter from the government
in Korea telling them that my Mom no longer
has any connection with the Korean govern-
ment." Choo said. "They were like, sorry, even
though your Dad has a permanent job here,
even though everyone in your family has paid
taxes, sorry, it doesn't count."
In May of2014, the summer after her sopho-
more year, Choo heard from a friend about the
tuition policy changes, which began in Janu-
ary. At that point, Choo discovered she was
eligible. She applied and, finally, was awarded
in-state tuition.
LSA sophomore Hangil Lee has also bene-
fitted from the changed tuition policies. When
he was in 5th grade, Lee moved from South
Korea to Troy, Michigan because his father
wanted a better education for him and his
sister. Had Lee not heard the tuition policies
mightbe changed, he would not have attended
the University, as four years of out-of-state
tuition would have been too steep for his fam-
ily to afford.
"My sister actually couldn't go to U of M,"
Lee said. "She had to go to MSU, which will
give you in-state tuition if you pay five years of
taxes."
Having gone through middle and high
school in the U.S., Lee knew he would be able
to gain in-state tuition if the change went
through, so his family decided to pay the out-
of-state tuition for his first semester - and it
paid off. Lee was granted in-state tuition start-
ing winter semester freshman year.
Despite not being in the limelight of discus-
sion, Choo and Lee have benefitted from the
tuition change. However, even though these
international students qualify for in-state
tuition, as non-citizens they are still ineligible
for need-based financial aid, and scholarships
are few and far between. Lee said the schol-
arships offered through the University are
extraordinarily competitive between interna-
tional students.
"It's pretty much almost impossible to get
them," he said.
There is a fund of $450,000 set up for
what is, at least this year, a small population
of undocumented students. Morales said stu-
dents are likely to use less than a quarter of the
funds.
"Let's say the number is between four and
six," Morales said. "Most of these kids are
going to be getting $20-25,000 covered. We'll
probablyuse maybe $100,000. Maybe."
Morales said it is likely the funding will be
reduced if the pilot financial aid program is
renewed. Rather than reducing these funds,
Choo said she believed that administrators
could allocate more dollars toward helping
international students residing in Michigan.

ald said. "Normally financial aid can range
from federal grants, to work-study positions,
to federally subsidized loans, and all of those
things require federal forms. The U of M
forms can be administered differently."
Morales said there are students who were
able to benefit from the in-state tuition as
well as the scholarship fund, and came to
the University. However, he said CTE did not
encourage undocumented students to apply to
the University for the 2014-2015 school year,
because the fate of the scholarship fund was
uncertain until mid-July.
"It's a very new thing," Morales said. "The
scholarship just kicked in so we're not going
to see any of it until one year from now, when
we have a new class in the fall. That's when I
think we'll see a decent number of undocu-
mented studentsfor the first time."
Although the full benefits to undocument-
ed students are still uncertain, a separate
group has already benefited from the changed
tuition policies - documented international
students. In all of the hype surrounding the
tuition changes aimed at undocumented stu-
dents, these students went unmentioned. The
international students who benefit are those
who are in Michigan legally and have lived

at the University. She had to pay out-of-state
tuition freshman year despite having lived in
Michigan for over a decade.
"I was like, if I'm not a Michigan resident,
and if I've been living in Michigan the entire
time I've been in the U.S., then what resident
am I?" she said.
The summer afterward, Choo's father
was sponsored for a green card through his
employers. Because Choo was under 21at the
time, and she was able to get a green card as
a dependent. Even after she became aperma-
nent resident of the U.S., Choo could not gain
in-state tuition. The old tuition policy had
strict requirements on who would be consid-
ered a Michigan resident. Choo explained,
"Starting my sophomore year, I was still pay-
ing out of state tuition because I couldn't dem-
onstrate to the residency classification office
that both my parents would permanently be in
the U.S," Choo said. "Despite the fact that my
Dad was living in the U.S.and he had a job here
and my father, my mother, and myself paid
taxes to the Michigan government, to the U of
M classification office, apparently that wasn't
enough to demonstrate that I was a Michigan
resident." Although Choo's father had perma-

the streets closest to campus. And, as Univer-
sity alum Nick Lemmer, the owner of Iorio's
Gelateria, observed, my purchasing habits as a
student reflect the breakdown of his clientele.
"I would say that almost 70 percent of our
customers are just Ann Arborites," he said.
"The student market is a very hard one to hit
because it's changing every year."
In areas farther away from Central Campus,
students make up an even smaller portion of
businesses' regular customer base.
"If you talk to any business owner on Main
Street," said Maura Thomson, executive direc-
tor of the Main Street Area Association, "they
would say they would like to capitalize more on
the studentpopulation. On a day-to-day basis, I
would say the Main Street area is more looked
at by students as the place where you take your
parents when they come into town."
The success of Ann Arbor's independent
businesses, then, isn't driven primarily by stu-
dents, but by resident Ann Arborites.
But why don't students shop at local stores
more often? Why do stu-
dents express such raven-
ousloyaltytocertain local
brandslike Blimpy Burger
E or Cottage Inn, while
spending the majority of
their cash at generic chain
stores?
Part of the answer to
those questions may be
found, as Assistant Pro-
fessor of Marketing Scott
Rick explained, in con-
sumer psychology.
"People do tend to be risk averse on aver-
age," Rick said. "It's like 'a bird in the hand
versus two in the bush.' Like'I know what Fi re
Guys can give me, but Red Hawk? That sounds
weird.'"
Breakingwith habit and tryinganew store or
restaurant can be difficult, and often requires
that the potential customer be faced with an
unusual circumstance.
"Often you have to be in some kind of unusu-
al state, you want to impress someone or you're
in a particularly good mood, and when people
are in a good mood they explore more," Rick
said.
Part of the answer may also be a market-
ing problem, as Iorio's owner Nick Lemmer
explained.
"Every year, you have a whole new group of
people who don't know you're here, and every
four years that group of however many thou-
sands of people is gone," he said. "It can be
expensive and you have to be sure that you're
spending your marketing money in the right
way to get that captive audience."
Combine inherent consumer risk aversion,
the difficulty of developing brand loyalty with
a rapidly changing student population, and
the proximity of State Street and South Uni-
versity to student housing, and the realization
that students spend most of their money at the
chain stores lining those streets doesn't come
as much of a surprise.
Ataleoftwocities
What is surprising is the rate at which the

business landscape in Ann Arbor is changing to
reflect the competing demands of convenience-
focused students clustered around central
campus.
John Kerr, an Ann Arbor native and owner
of Wazoo Records on State Street,hasseenpro-
found changes in the areas closest to central
campus since growing up in the city in the '50s
and '60s.
"I remember going over (to South Univer-
sity) Christmas Eve because I had some des-
perate last minute gift to get and was shocked
to find -this was in the last few years - that
everything was closed. When the students
leave town, they just have no reason to stay
open. It was like a ghost
town, this was noon-ish on
Christmas Eve," Kerr said.
"And I remember shopping
Christmas Eve (on South ,,
University) as a child, there It went
were a lot oftcool stores there .
where you could get gifts for that cat(
your mom or whatever, there
were all sorts of nice places." .-
Kerr attributes those U niverst
changes to a shift in consum-
erfocus. theysta
"It went from businesses ste
that catered to the entire i
University community, be tobush
they staff, students, etc., to
businesses that cater exclu- excluSi V
sively to students."
For the most part, the
businesses catering to stu-
dent demand are not unique -JO
to Ann Arbor. There are
certainly a few Ann Arbor
originals, like South U Pizza,
Lucky Kitchen or BTB Can-
tina that have succeeded in
carving out a niche in the
student market. Generally,
they offer late hours, cheap prices and fast ser-
vice, all of which attracted Iorio's owner Nick
Lemmer during his time as a student.
"For me, it was always finding something
cheap," Lemmer said. "You know, 'Where are
the coupons at?' When I'm ready to splurge on
something, maybe I'd go to a more expensive
place. I never really put that much thought into
where I was eating, I was just happy to be eat-
ing."
But, more often than not, that desire for
cheap products and fast service leads students
away from unique local stores and, increas-
ingly, drives local stores away from students.
The vast majority of independent businesses in
Ann Arbor now cluster in areas with less stu-
dent-heavy populations, like Kerrytown and
Main Steet, where there seems to be a greater
demand for unique business experiences.
LSA senior and Ann Arbor native Adam
DesJardins, who currently lives in Kerrytown,
prefers shopping at local businesses as a way
to support the community and preserve the
uniqueness of the city.
"I would say I favor the local places, just
because I think that my money goes further,
honestly.-I feel my money goes further because
I'm supporting a place I love ... I just think that
when you have a community and a town, you

think of your three favorite places, they're not
necessarily like CVS and Walgreens. You don't
say 'I love Ann Arbor because the Chili's there
is awesome.'"
Thomson saw that same love for the authen-
tic Ann Arbor experience during the Great
Recession of 2008.
"We weathered ita lot better than I thought
we would," Thomson said. "And I think that's
a testament to the longtime business owners
we had down there. I think itspeaks a lot to the
support of the community. There were a lot of
people that made an effort ... redoubled their
efforts to support the community. And around
that time I think we also became more aware of
supporting

The cost of development
The increasingly sharp divide between the
convenience-focused businesses around Cen-
tral Campus and the "experience economy" of
areas like Main Street and Kerrytown is part of
a larger process of growth and development in
Ann Arbor that has perhaps done the most to
alter the appearance of the city in recent years.
A number of high-rise apartments and office
spaces have supplanted smaller buildings and
now dominate the skyline in the areas around
South University and the Michigan Union as
well as along Huron Street on the North Side
of town. Kelly Cobb, a University alum who
recently returned to Ann Arbor to open Hunt-
er House Hamburgers on East William, was
stunned when he first saw the rate and scale of
the change.
"When my wife and I first pulled up not hav-
ing been here in eight years, Ann Arbor was
very unrecognizable," Cobb said. "The number
of high-rises that came in was shocking, I had
friends' apartments that were just gone and
replaced with 15-story buildings."
That development has been partially driven

by an influx of high-tech firms, which have
provided high-paying jobs and increase Ann
Arbor's recognition beyond its association with
the University. As Kerr, the owner of Wazoo
records, has seen in recent years, Ann Arbor is
becoming an increasingly popular tourist des-
tination.
"I've noticed that the trend over the last few
summers that kind of fascinates me is that it
seems like it's almost more of a tourist crowd in
town. I get the impression that Ann Arbor has
become a little better known nationwide as a
good place to visit, even if you're not on Univer-
sity business, you know, with the restaurants
and the things to do culturally."
Yet, Ann Arbor's recent growth may actu-
ally be providing the greatest challenge for the
city's independent local businesses.
Seva restaurant was forced to relocate out-
side of the downtown area when faced with
a massive rent increase, and in nearly every
interview I conducted while doing research
for this piece, members of the Ann Arbor busi-
ness community expressed concern about the
effects of rapidly rising rents on local busi-
nesses.
"In a way we're a victim of our own success,"
saidThomson."We areaverysuccessfuldown-
town which means rents are a certain amount.
A property owner is the only one that has the
abilityto dictate who is coming into a space, so
it comes down to rent and who can afford the
rents that are being charged."
As the changing business climate in recent
years has shown, both national and Michigan-
based regional chains seem slightly better
equipped to cope with those rising costs than
many unique Ann Arbor businesses.
Ann Arbor in the balance
Ann Arbor faces a dilemma that continues to
grow in scope and seriousness with each pass-
ing year. As a city, how does it strike a balance
between progress and preservation?
For Cobb, owner of Hunter House, the two
aren't necessarily at odds.
"There's a lot of discussion about whether
(Ann Arbor) should growout more or stay what
it is, but I don't see them as mutually exclusive.
I think you can draw more people in, but still
have the unique Ann Arbor feel that is so Ann
Arbor."
For Thomson, executive director ofthe Main
Street Area Association, preserving the unique
Ann Arbor experience is equally important.
"I think that's really what sets us apart and,
for me, that's the message that I'm always try-
ing to put out there. We have to be careful that
we don't become 'Everywhere, U.S.A."'
And for DesJardins, a University student,
Ann Arbor's originality seems to be ebbing
away.
"To me, to seeall of these new places coming
in is a little sad. I mean it's fair game because
they're still businesses, but I definitely prefer
local businesses when it comes to that."
But if one thing is certain, it's that students
play an important role in shaping Ann Arbor's
business landscape. If Ann Arbor is going to
succeed in maintaining its unique character,
we might need to do a better job of getting out
and exploring the town.
