Animal rights group:
'U' training involving
cats and pigs is illegal
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Managing News Editor
An animal rights organization launched
a formal complaint with the United States
Department of Agriculture against the
University of Michigan Health System last
week, charging that the use of cats and
pigs in a Survival Flight course for nurses
is cruel and illegal.
Is the complaint filed by People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, the orga-
nization calls for the USDA to investigate
UMHS's Survival Flight course. Accord-
ing to PETA Vice President of Laboratory
Investigations Kathy Guillermo, the use of
pigs and cats in the course is in violation
of the Animal Welfare Act, which governs
the treatment of animals in a laboratory
setting.
"It's indefensible and likely illegal for
the University of Michigan to maim and
kill cats and pigs," Guillermo said in an
interview.

ait of the Office of the Vice President for
* Research, UMHS defended the training
methods used in the course and vowed to

Can the one-man show keep going?

SOUTH BEND, Ind. -
efore I say anything, it should be
noted that the fans who watched
Saturday's win against Notre
Dame watched what could have been
the greatest individual performance by a
Michigan player ever.
It was truly a special occasion. Denard
Robinson's feats of speed and agility and
moxie were so unbelievable that to try to
describe them with mere words seems
almost to cheapen them. Michigan
fans - not to mention all the Irish fans
who packed into Notre Dame Stadium
- should consider themselves extremely
lucky to have witnessed such an incred-
ible player's ascent into national super-

stardom.
That being said, prepare to get your
buzz effectively
killed.
I really hate to play
this role, but Ihave
to. On Saturday, Rob-
inson accounted for
502 yards of offense
(I'm sorry, just writ-
ing that makes my-
jaw drop. Re-affixing JOE
it ... now). STAPLETON
Michigan's total - -
yards, as a team?
532.
Any way you phrase it - he did, in fact,

account for more than 94 percent of the
offense - that number is either amazing
or terrifying, depending on your view.
For now, feel free tobe amazed, and
that's perfectly okay.
But here's the terrifying part: what
everyone saw on Saturday was as close
to a one-man team as you can get in foot-
ball.
Now, despite what people have
alleged, I'm not stupid - I fully realize
that there are five offensive lineman
clearing the way for every spectacular
run; there are receivers there catching
every 100-mile-per-hour pass; and there
is a defense playing valiantly while Rob-
inson is resting on the bench.

With that qualification in mind, I have
to reiterate: In football, the ultimate team
sport, this Michigan team has been as
close to a one-man team as one can be the
past two weeks.
For Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez, there appears tobe no limit to the
amount of carries he's willing to give
Robinson. Or if there is, it's just very
loosely defined.
, "What did I tell you last week?" Rodri-
guez said."'We can't be running him 29
times again.' We ran him 28. We're just
trying to win the game. That's more than
we wanted."
It has the ring of someone who insists

GAME TIME

NYU students put up in hotel

Upon arriving at New
York University for their fall
semester, 38 lucky students
were placed in overflow
housing at a luxury hotel in
midtown Manhattan, accord-
ing to a Sept. 7 article in the
Washington Square News.
The students on the fifth
floor of the Affinia Hotel
have access to wireless inter-
net, cable TV, air condition-
ing and exercise facilities, as
well as twice-weekly clean-
ing service, according to the
article. All the rooms include
kitchenettes, and NYU has
provided a shuttle for the
students that runs every So
minutes to campus.
The University placed two
RAs on the third floor of the
hotel to ensure that all prop-
er NYU housing policies are
enforced, according to the

article.
As of last Friday, 10 of the
students had been trans-
ferred to University resi-
dence halls.
BROWN TRIES
GOING TRAYLESS
Brown University is cur-
rently testing out a trayless
system in dining halls simi-
lar to the one University of
Michigan students tried last
spring, according to a Sept.
7 article in The Brown Daily
Herald.
The trayless system may
only be temporary depend-
ing on the results, Ann
Hoffman, director of admin-
istration of Dining Services,
told the Daily Herald, and its
environmental advantages
may be overshadowed by

practicality.
A completely trayless
system "would be difficult
because of the waythe refec-
tory is currently laid out, but
we will advance the initiative
as much as is operationally
feasible," Hoffman told the
Daily Herald.
According to the article,
many students are respond-
ing positively to the changes.

As part of the Univer-

devastated nation in search
of a community in particular
need of assistance, according
to aSept. 7article inthe Daily

Bruin.
The group was led by Dr.
Ami Ben-Artzi, an assistant
clinical professor of medi-
cine, and plans to aid the
country by providing educa-
tional opportunities in areas
including technology, eco-
nomics, law and engineering,
the article stated.
By the end of the trip,
which was funded by the
University and individual
faculty members, the group
had compiled a short list of
communities that would
benefit most from its efforts.
Cayes-Jacmel, a suburb of
Jacmel about 25 miles from
Port-au-Prince, will most
likely be chosen for the proj-
ect, a member of the initia-
tive told the Daily Bruin.

EPA probes
the effects of
drilling for oil

ise and a cabin in the wildfire that destroyed 169 homes.
uthorities search for
.o o. w ldfires source

EPA aims to prevent
water pollution as a
result of drilling
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The oil
and gas industry is urging the
Environmental Protection Agen-
cy to keep a narrow focus in its
study of how a drilling technique
that involves blasting chemical-
laced water into the ground may
affect drinking water - while
environmental groups want the
study to cover everything from
road-building to waste disposal.
The issues will be aired today
in two-minute speaking slots at
an EPA hearing twice postponed
last month because of security
concerns over rallies and crowds
anticipated in the thousands.
The hearing, the last of four
around the country, will be
held in two sessions today and
two more on Wednesday at The
Forum in Binghamton, 115 miles
southwest of Albany. The EPA is
taking comment on how broadly
to construct its study of hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, a tech-
nique for releasing natural gas
from rock formations thousands
of feet underground by injecting
at high pressure millions of gal-
lons of water mixed with chemi-
cals and sand.
Congress directed the EPA to
take a new look at fracking as gas
drillers swarm to the lucrative
Marcellus Shale region beneath

Pennsylvania, New York, West
Virginia and Ohio and other shale
reserves around the country. Con-
cerns that the process can poison
private wells and water aquifers
have driven opposition, while the
industry insists there's no evi-
dence linking fracking to any con-
taminated water sources.
In Wyoming, which also has
large shale reserves, the EPA
has told residents in Pavillion, a
farming and ranching area, not to
drink water from about 40 nearby
wells. Residents speculate their
water supplies have been polluted
by fracking, but the EPA's tests
have been inconclusive.
Just last week, the EPA asked
nine major gas drilling companies
to voluntarily disclose the chemi-
cals used in fracking. Drilling
companies, calling their chemical
formulas proprietary, have large-
ly sought to avoid that disclosure.
Fracking is specifically exclud-
ed from regulation under the fed-
eral Safe Drinking Water Act, in
part because of a widely quoted
2004 EPA study that concluded
the process posed no threat to
drinking water sources. That
study was widely criticized for,
among other things, its narrow
focus on coalbed methane depos-
its and its lack of independent
field studies.
Environmental groups hope
the new EPA study will validate
their position that there are many
risks that need to be addressed by
regulators at the federal level.

Colorado fire
auses hundreds of
tizens to evacuate
BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -
ndreds of people evacuated
ring one of the most destruc-
e wildfires in Colorado his-
y returned to their scorched
mes yesterday, surrounded by
dreary sight of burnt trees,
Ated mailboxes and uneven
ches of blackened ground.
Residents were allowed to
urn to their homes in the
ulder foothills as firefighters
hed closer to fully contain-
the blaze that has burned 10
are miles and investigators
bed its cause.
A senior law enforcement
icial familiar with the inves-
ation told the Denver Post
at authorities are looking
o whether a fire pit sparked
wildfire, which could mean
tminal charges are possible.
e newspaper did not name the
cial.
Authorities previously said
fire may have started after a
ticle crashed into a propane
k. The sheriff's office is aware
the Post article but won't
mment on the cause or ori-
of the fire because it's under
estigation, said Sarah Hunt-
, a spokeswoman for the fire
ponse.
Like other residents, Nancy
d Jim Edwards picked up a
mit yesterday morning to re-
er their neighborhood, but

they found out that the roads
leading up to where they live is
still closed. Jim Edwards said
they might drive as far as they're
allowed.
"We might take a ride, but it is
really heartbreaking to see the
stuff," he said.
Edwards said he spotted their
house through a telescope from
Flagstaff Mountain outside Boul-
der and saw that it was destroyed.
"It looked like a nuclear disas-
ter," Nancy Edwards said. She
said they plan to rebuild.
At one destroyed property, all
that was left was a stone chim-
ney surrounded by walls of brick
about waist high. Saplings in the
front yard were burnt and barely
their trunks remained. A barbe-
cue grill lay upside down, along
with seven metal mailboxes
nearby. The house's separate
garage had been reduced to a
heap of ashes.
As residents returned home,
some plead for privacy from the
media.
Utility workers were restoring
electricity to the homes where
residents had returned, repair-
ing and installing new poles and
lines. Qwest also was working
to fix about 3,000 telephone and
DSL lines.
Fire officials warned that
much of the area is dangerous
because of downed power lines
and poles, damaged roads and
exposed mine shafts.
Still, Boulder firefighting
operations were being scaled
back and some crews are being
relieved six days after the wild-

fire there erupted and quickly
destroyed at least 166 homes. The
fire was 73 percent yesterday and
officials said full containment
was expected by this evening.
Fire spokesman Terry Kras-
ko said yesterday firefighters
have been overwhelmed by the
community's gratitude and are
especially touched by a wall of
thank-you notes at their com-
mand camp.
"That's probably one of the
hardest walls for all the fire-
fighters to go up to," Krasko said.
"They really have a tough time
with that. The community sup-
port has been tremendous for
them."
So far, the fire has cost more
than $6.7 million to contain.
Winds drove the fire out of con-
trol and strong gusts later in
the week triggered fears that
it might spread into the city of
Boulder. Officials urged resi-
dents to prepare to evacuate, but
fire lines held and no evacuations
were needed.
The Boulder Sheriff's Office is
leading the investigation into the
cause and origin of the fire, with
assistance from the U.S. Forest
Service. The loss of homes sur-
passed that of the 2002 Hayman
fire in southern Colorado, which
destroyed 133 homes and 466
outbuildings over 138,000 acres,
or more than 215 square miles.
That fire was started at a
campground by a U.S. Forest Ser-
vice employee who burned a let-
ter from her estranged husband.
She served six years in prison for
it and was released in 2008.

Across county, Tea
Party holds rallies

Tea Party members
gather in cities from
D.C. to Sacramento
to spread message
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -
Tea party activists gathered in cit-
ies on each coast and in between
yesterday to spread their message
of smaller government and focus
their political movement on the
pivotal congressional elections in
November.
Several thousand people
marched along Pennsylvania Ave-
nue from the Washington Monu-
ment to the Capitol, many carrying
signs reading "Congress You're
Fired" and "Let Failures Fail and
"Impeach Obama."
"It wouldn't bother me to make
a clean sweep," said Michael Power
of Decatur, Ala., endorsing term
limits for members of Congress.
"There are some good ones, but we
can lose those."
In Sacramento, an estimated

4,000 people poured into the former
McClellan Air Force Base site for
the "United to the Finish" rally -
far fewer than the 25,000 to 50,000
crowd organizers had predicted.
Leslie and Gary Morrison of
Redding drove 150 south to Sacra-
mento with their dog Phoebe, just
two weeks after flyingtoWashing-
ton to attend a large rally hostedby
conservative commentator Glenn
Beck. They said they liked the feel-
ing of solidarity at the tea party
events.
"This is a way to get people
focused before the election," Les-
lie Morrison said. "And it's a way
to get the tea party's true numbers
seen."
Many attending rallies in
WashYwore red, white and blue
clothing and carried yellow flags
with the picture of a snake coiled
above the inscription "Don't Tread
On Me."
In St. Louis, they packed the
area between the Gateway 'Arch
and the Mississippi River, and ven-
dors sold lemonade, meat on sticks,
T-shirts and other souvenirs.

Textbook case of spending
Faculty members must help lower textbook costs
A new school year means time to hit the books, but soaring
textbook prices have students reaching time and time again
for their wallets. But there could be hope for students' sav-
ings accounts in the near future following the introduction of a
federal law that requires professors to post a list of textbooks for
their classes during registration. This new regulation could signif-
icantly benefit the student body and the University faculty should
recognize the law's potential to help their students. The provision
provides a sensible rule for faculty members to follow, but teachers
should take the initiative to find ways to decrease the cost of books
even further.

Constructing the Constitution

On Jul. 1, a provision to the Higher
Education Opportunity Act that require
professors at schools that receive federal
funding to post textbook lists at the time of
registration became effective. According
to figures from the Student Public Interest
Research Group, students spend an aver-
age of $900 on textbooks each year. The
regulation aims to decrease that expense.
But many students said the new rules
won't change their shopping habits despite
new, cheaper options being available to
them, according to a report last week in
the Daily.
Students should take advantage of the
provision. It will give students more time
to buy textbooks. This means that students
will have more opportunity to compare
prices from websites and local bookstores.
Granting access to required readings prior
to the start of school would give students
ample time to scan through textbook
websites like Half.com, Amazon.com and
Cheapbooks.com before waiting in line
at local University bookstores. The added
competition could help to encourage local
bookstores to offer more books to rent
a significantly cheaper option - and per-
haps even drive down prices.
In addition to the benefit of lowering stu-

dent costs, this law could potentially help
students become more prepared for class.
As such, faculty should make every effort
to comply with the regulation. They can
start by making sure to post book lists in
accordance with this policy change. But
to ensure students don't buy non-required
books, faculty should also indicate specifi-
cally which texts are required and which
are optional for further reading.
University faculty should also recognize
that complying with this law isn't limited
to posting book lists early. At its core, the
law is meant to alleviate the burden of
costs on students. In keeping with the spir-
it of the law, University faculty members
should consider choosing less expensive,
textbooks when feasible. Faculty should
also make additional books available on
reserve at the library and consider posting
more reading excerpts online via CTools.
With the rising costs of higher educa-
tion, this provision could help students
manage tight budgets responsibly. And
faculty members should go the extra mile
to provide students with textbook lists and
possibly cheaper alternatives to expensive
textbooks. The federal government has
done its job, now it is up to faculty to make
the policy reach as far as possible.

Summarizing a silly debate with
casual British nonchalance,
Charles Brooker, a columnist
for The Guard-
ian, wrote: "I once
had a poo in a pub
about two minutes'
walk from Buck-
ingham Palace.
I was not subse-
quently arrested
and charged with
crapping directly
onto the Queen's IMRAN
pillow. That's how
'distance' works" SYED
('Ground Zero _
mosque'? The real-
ity is lessprovocative, 08/23/2010).
As the ninth anniversary of Sept.11
passes, we once again take a moment
to reflect how much the world
changed that day. But the physics of
"distance" still doesn't bend for sen-
timentality, and Brooker's point is
well taken. The supposed "Ground
Zero mosque" is being built a good
two minutes' walk away from ground
zero, and in New York City, that's a
buffer zone of countless buildings
and tens of thousands of people.
Liberal know-it-ails have embraced
this side of the story and mocked cer-
tain oblivious conservatives who insist
that Ground Zero has special sig-
nificance, and no mosque can be built
there. But in indulging this idiotic side
debate, the actual important point is
lost - if the First Amendment is still
good, that mosque can be built even
on the hallowest of grounds, proper
building permits considered.
But suddenly that's not the argu-
ment. By advocating the most ludi-
crous extreme possible, the Right has
managed to water down the debate
so much that a principled stand for
a fundamental constitutional right is
off the table. And recently, scumbag
Donald Trump offered to just buy
up land at a premium to prevent the
mosque from being built there. Such

benighted ignorance is a grave mis-
take, reminiscent of this country's
greatest failure: Segregation. One
part of that story follows.
Mayor Johnny Smith was a fine
man. As recounted in Kevin Boyle's
award-winning book, "Arc of Jus-
tice," Smith was elected in 1924 and
guided Detroit through tumultuous
times. Despite the city's spiraling
prosperity - thanks to the industrial
boom that made Detroit America's
fourth largest city - racial tensions
created dangerous unrest.
A Polish-Catholic who came up
from the streets of the city's East Side,
Smith was working class through and
through. He was a champion of the
huddled masses who madeup the mas-
sive, miserable underbelly of Detroit's
industrial juggernaut, and Smith's
election was a step for progress. .
And Johnny Smith never really.
changed. He always remained a
champion of the poor, the weak and
even the black. But when times got
tough, he made the mistake of accept-
ing compromise on the question of
basic civil rights. On such things,
there can never be compromise.
Detroit had clearly segregated
housingeven as early as the 1920s. But
black professionals who had earned
a reputation and a fortune thought
they deserved better. If they had the
moneyto move to a nicer house on the
white side of town, wasn't that their
right as Americans?
So thought Dr. Alexander Turner,
a respected black surgeon. And he
probably still thought it while hud-
dled in a pool of blood on the floor
of his car as his chauffeur sped away
from an angry white mob that had
just thrown Turner out of his new
house. So thought Dr. Ossian Sweet,
whose murder trial for firing into
another angry white mob seeking to
evict him is one of the most famous in
Michigan's annals of justice.
And sotoo, thought Johnny Smith.
Certainly black people had the right

to live wherever they wished, Smith
said in an open letter printed in the
city's newspapers on Sept. 12, 1925.
But, he went on to say: "It does not do
for any man to demand to the fullest
any right which the law gives him."
Black people, Smith believed, needed
to calm down, play nice and stop try-
ing to exercise rights they technically
did have.
The "Ground '
Zero mosque" is a
civil rights issue.

Smith was wrong. Black peoples
right to live anywhere they please
means nothing unless they are pro-
tected in choosing to live peacefully
among white neighbors who do Vt
want them there.
Today we recognize that truth.
Perhaps one day soon we'll recognize
another truth as well: If freedom of
religion still exists in this country,
Muslims can build a mosque (within
fair ordinances and with permits)
wherever they damn well please.
Hallowed ground? That'swhat
those white mobs said of white neigh-
borhoods. But thankfully, it's st#l
America, and the Constitution doesn't
make such fickle exceptions. Dr. Sweet
had the great Clarence Darrow and
Frank Murphy - the University law
school's two proudest alumni - to
ensure that even an all-white jury was
convinced of that crucial truth.
The mobs gather again now, in New
York and elsewhere, to deny a minor-
ity group its constitutional rights.
Who will rise against the madness to
defeat them this time?

Bridge the healthy food gap

0I

Millennials take Manhattan

Let's face some facts. We live in a state in
which many cities are ridden with fast food
and cheap corner store goods, but lack acces-
sible nutritious food. I understand what you're
probably saying to yourself: "This kid is about
to go all Food, Inc. on me." Though I admire
your guess, it's not completely correct.
Living in Ann Arbor is nearly a delusional
experience. This year, I'm in a residence hall
equipped with a cafe designated to serve vege-
tarian and vegan meals. On my two-block walk
to class each morning, I pass at least three or
four restaurants that serve local produce and
consider their menu sustainable. What I mean
is that Ann Arbor could probably serve as Al
Gore's mythical oasis. But it's easy to forget
that although Ann Arbor may be a hotbed for
yuppie culture, we too have our own plight in
respect to nutritional food accessibility.
In Ann Arbor, although nutritious food may
be aplenty, accessibility for disenfranchised
citizens borders the impossible. According to a
Hunger in America 2010 study, there have been
approximately 44,000 new recipients of food
assistance since 2006, as reported by annarbor.
com in February. The average benefit for U.S.
recipients of aid in 2009 was $133.12 per month.
I'm not quite sure when you last stepped into
the Ann Arbor Whole Foods, but a dinner for a
family of five could quite possibly cost $133.12.
The consequences on the community are
grim. To combat the problem of high prices, the
recipients of aid often buy processed and fatty
foods from cheap neighborhood stores. Health
problems causedby poor diet have reached an all
time high nationwide. They are especially acute
in low-income citizens from Michigan - citizens
to whom healthy foods are virtually unavailable.
The Fair Food Network of Michigan recog-
nized this fundamental need in numerous com-
munities across the state. According to a story
published on annarbor.com on Sept. 7, the FFN
recognized a dire need in the Ann Arbor area,
and established a "Double Up Food Bucks"

program in both the Ypsilanti Farmers Market
and Ann Arbor's Westside Market in Kerry-
town. The "Double Up Food Bucks" incentive
enhances the Ann Arbor Farmers Market's cur-
rent program, which accepts food stamps and
other food assistance programs in exchange for
Michigan-grown fruits and vegetables.
Though the Ann Arbor Farmers Market
made headway by accepting food assistance
money last year, the fault was not with their
program, but with food culture as a whole.
Buying a $5 head of lettuce at the market was
previously fiscally irresponsible to the average
recipient of aid, especially when those five dol-
lars could be spent for a larger quantity of food
elsewhere. "Double Up Food Bucks" puts an end
to this nutritional calamity. The new program
now doubles bridge card spending at the mar-
ket up to $20. Do the math. Someone who would
regularly spend $20 at the market now gets $40
worth of fresh groceries.
Programs like "Double Up Food Bucks"
clearly aren't feasible in every community, but
local and federal governments should attempt
to connect with organizations that encour-
age nutritionally conscious and local food aid
for the poor and maligned. If based on noth-
ing more than basic economic virtue, it's in the
state government's best interests to keep its aid
money rooted in Michigan. Local food makes
sense. Farmers in Michigan benefit economical-
ly, the carbon footprint of locally produced food
is much less than its processed counterpart and
the nutritional benefits trump those of nation-
ally produced and packaged products.
We have a duty to our posterity and our-
selves to support agencies - like the Fair Food
Network - that evoke socially responsible
ideas. The opportunity to invest in our future
is now. As a society, we have the chance to
flourish by encouraging healthy alternatives -
or die by our own fork and knife.

for most people of
our generation at
our first jobs will
be disproving the
assumption that -
we're ignorant LIBBY
and entitled. Face- ASHTON
book's creator,
Mark Zuckerberg,
has given our gen-
eration's reputation a boost but it's
just not enough for our faces to be
seen over the towering images of
Snooki and Heidi Montag.
During my internship this sum-
mer, I made a good first impres-
sion on my boss, whose friends had
exchanged horror stories about
incompetent interns and warned her
not to have high hopes. All I had to do
to exceed expectations was to know
how to converse with her and not roll
my eyes at her.
Maybe all the praise and reinforce-
ment that's paved my way to young
adulthood has blurred my self-concept
of 18- to 26-year-olds. But I thought
we, asa unit of Millenials, were amaz-
ing and everyone knew it. But I've
heard our generation described as
delusional and conceited.
We have a reputation for acting
entitled, lazy and being incapable of
completing any actual work. Maybe
we're decent students and creative
enough to turn out some impressive
iPhoto albums, but we're digging our-
selves into a hole in the field of real-
world work - which is a pretty dried
up place to begin with.
I think our generation is misun-
derstood - by everyone, including
us. The New York Times Magazine

recently published a ten-page piece
by Robin Marantz Henig called
"What Is It About 20-Somethings?"
in which she discusses the work of
psychologist Jeffrey Arnett, who
attempts to make sense of some of the
confusing and contradictory charac-
teristics of what he calls "emerging
adulthood." This piece - along with
conversations with my summer boss
and others - gave my picture of our
demographic some clarity.
I now have a grasp on two visions
of today's emerging adults. One is
that we're a group of spoiled, cod-
dled, developmentally stunted, over-
grown children who irrationally
expect praise and success where
none is due. The other is that we're
inspired, enlightened, uncompromis-
ing, justice-oriented change agents
who look past the recession and the
politically-infected federal govern-
ment to see a better world - and are
willing to work for it.
Parts of each of these descriptions
have always characterized 20-some-
things, while other parts are specific
to our generation. Since the turn of
the twentieth century, psychologists
have been aware of the "sense of pos-
sibilities" that exists in young people.
However, our generation has been
uniquely described as the "happiness
generation" - we prioritize personal
fulfillment above all else. So those
two qualities together explain why
we turn down our fourth choice job
offer: we won't be miserable and we
know something better exists. It's
not, in most cases, because we're lazy
and want more money.
There are those who say that soci-
ety's acceptance of our generation
putting off the start of a family until
our 30s and taking our time to figure
out the exact career path we want to
follow is allowing us to stay children
forever. Stalling commitment, how-
ever, doesn't necessarily mean we're
stalling our adult selves from emerg-

ing. Many of us are investing a lot of
energy and serious consideration to
figuring out what, exactly, will bring
us the most fulfillment and how,
exactly, we want to impact the world.
Our generation
has a reputation for
acting entitled.
Before jumping into a committed
relationship, a career and a mort,
gage (some or all of which I plan td
have before I'm thirty), I want to do
whatever I can to ensure "the dreary,
dead-end jobs, the bitter divorces, the
disappointing and disrespectful chil,
dren" - as TheNewYork Times Maga5
zine putit - are not a part of my future
and Arnett's research says 96 percent
of you, as 20-somethings, don't sel
that in your futures either. Our critic
see this period of exploration and con-
sideration as arrested development
which I suppose it is if we're hiding
from adulthood instead of sizing it u
and seeing where we fit into it.

gation.
Guillermo said that though
the organization filed the com-
plaint to protect the rights of ani-
mals, she also believes the course
doesn't provide nurses with the
best training available. Students
would receive better training by
using simulators instead of other
tactics like "thrusting" a tube
down a cat's trachea, she said.
"Unlike deadly animal labs,
simulators replicate human anat-
omy and simulators allow train-
ees to repeat procedures until
they get good at them," Guillermo
said. "This is about a choice to
provide sub-standard training for
the nurses in this course."
According to its statement, the
University aims to provide the
nurses with adequate training
through the use of both human
patient simulators and training
sessions involving animals. In
addition, officials have decreased
the number of training sessions
with animals and increased the
use of simulators, the statement
says.

They keep on saying they'll start

he doesn't want to run Robinson
more than 25 times every week
until the end of the season, but
f these results continue to be so
delicious, you can bet Robinson
will get the ball as many times as
it takes to win. And maybe, just
maybe, that will pay off.
Maybe Robinson will keep
playing the way he's playing.
Maybe when teams make Rob-
inson beat him with his arm, he
will. Maybe he'll stay healthy.
All of that could very well
happen (the jury's still out, in
my opinion, on whether or not
it's actually possible to game-
p1an around his speed). But that
last point remains a real con-
rern. We're two weeks into the
college football season, and Rob-
nson has taken two trips to the
gideline with apparent injury.
Each time, it hasn't been serious,
but the law of averages says that
if he continues to run the ball as

animals during training are
the same as ones that are per-
formed on human patients, such
as inserting a breathing tube or
accessing blood vessels and body
cavities for life support and other
therapeutic purposes," the state-
ment reads. "Some of these proce-
dures are the very same ones used
routinely by veterinarians when
treating animals at their clinics
- for example, intubation of cats
for spaying."
The statement also states
that most of the "small number
of cats" used in the course are
adopted afterward.
Despite the defense, Guillermo
said PETA is still moving for-
ward with the complaint and is
waiting to hear the results of the
USDA investigation. She added
that since filing the complaint,
the organization has heard from
anumber of concerned University
alumni.
"We will be talking to them
about how they can object to
this and we will probably move
forward with a campaign," she
said.
Guillermo added that the Uni-
versity's course is "an anomaly"
many times as he has the first
two games, it will be eventually.
And that's a possibility most
Michigan fans have blocked out
of their psyches in much the
same way they blocked out that
one time they walked in on their
parents.
But this goes beyond injury.
Even through passing, simply
relying on Robinson as much as
this team has is extremely dan-
gerous. One-man teams can only
go so far. It's true in any sport.
One of the arguments for
depending on Robinson so much
is that, should he get injured,
there are two very qualified
quarterbacks on the sideline
ready to step in. While that may
be true, there aren't two Robin-
sons. And this team simply relies
on him too much to proceed
without a hitch when he leaves
the game. If he accounted for
maybe half of his team's total
yards on Saturday, it would be
different. But not 94 percent.
It's essential to get the run-
ning backs involved. I realize
they weren't running very well
early on in the game Saturday,
but allowing them to take some
of the punishment and carry
some of the load will be invalu-
able toward alleviating some of

ing flight survival courses don't
use similar training methods
involving animals.
"The University of Michigan is
in the dark ages on this one," she
said.
However last December, a Uni-
versity team won a competition
assessing flight survival skills for
the third year in a row, according
to a UMHS press release.
In January 2009, a different
UMHS course came under fire for
using dogs to practice life-saving
procedures, when The Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medi-
cine - an organization funded by
PETA - filed acomplaintwiththe
USDA alleging that the profes-
sor of the Advanced Trauma Life
Support course lied to a Univer-
sity committee to get permission
to use the dogs for the course. The
complaint also alleged that the
use of dogs as training dummies
was in violation of the Animal
Welfare Act.
Shortly after the complaint
was filed, University officials
announced that the class would
stop using dogs and only use sim-
ulators for training instead.

take anything away from Robin-
son's performance - calling his
game-winning drive a "Heisman
moment" would be an under-
statement on par with calling
the Big House the "Pretty Good-
Sized" House. But Michigan has
relied on Robinson as much as
the Cleveland Cavaliers used to
rely on LeBron James, and that's
not a good thing.
Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly
had this to say regarding Robin-
son's workload:
"You run a quarterback 25
times, you have to have tough-
ness," Kelly said. "I'll let Coach
figure out if that's the case for ten
games. Coach Rodriguez knows
his team better than I do. We hit
him pretty hard today, but he's a
good, tough kid."
He is indeed a good, tough kid.
But even a kid as good and tough
as Robinson has his limits.
But then again ... does he?

think differently about a variety of
issues.
Ted London, an expert on the
impact of market-based strate-
gies on poverty alleviation and the
director of the Base of the Pyra-
mid Initiative at the University's
William Davidson Institute, said
Prahalad brought his inquisitive
nature to all of his projects.
"What I remember most about
C.K. is his questions," London said.
"He could kind of reframe the way
we think about things."
The speakers who knew Pra-
halad as a teacher, colleague, aca-
demic collaborator and leader
emphasized that Prahalad's influ-
ence stretched far beyond theoret-
ical ideas and discussions.
Jan Timmer, former CEO of
Philips Electronics, said Prahalad
helped save the company when it
was in "very dire straights" and on
the verge of bankruptcy.
The two met for lunch one day,
Timmer recalled, and discussed
the state of the company. By the
end of the meal, they had formed

reinvent our state," Snyder, said.
"That's what drove me to run."
During his question and answer-
centered talk, Snyder - the for-
mer president of Gateway Inc. and
founder of Ann Arbor SPARK, an
organization that provides funding
to start-up ventures - focused on
the unlikely growth of his campaign
and the role University students
play in the state's future.
Snyder said he chose to run for
governor after realizing that the
state's economic problems required
more than quick "fixes."
"We have a broken government
model in our state. 'Fixes' are not
good enough," Snyder said. "It's
time for structural reform."
Though he had. never run a
political campaign before entering
the race, Snyder said his business
experiences prepared him for the

of the process from developing the
platform, to researching University
finances, from sitting at the table to
creating an effective communica-
tion system, and finally, the ratifica-
tion vote itself," Halloran said in the
press release.
James Anderson, who led the
LEO bargaining team, echoed Hal-
loran's comments, thanking the
other members of the union's nego-
tiation group.
"It's terrific that the members
have ratified the work of the bar-

a way to restructure and revitalize
Philips.
"It was remarkable," Timmer
said. "It was only that lunch, there
was no paperwork, there were no
studies, there were no committees.
There was nothing but a meeting
of minds and a handshake."
At a gathering of 100 Philips
executives, Timmer said Prahalad
conducted "psychological war-
fare" on a "hostile and difficult
audience" with decades of expe-
rience and resistance to reform.
Eventually, Prahalad convinced
the executives that the company
was headed for destruction if
things didn't change.
"He was like an exorcist driv-
ing out all the bad habits of these
people," Timmer said Saturday.
The ninth of 11 children, Pra-
halad was born in Coimbatore,
India in 1941. His father was a
well-known Sanskrit scholar and
judge and his mother was a home-
maker.
While earning his Bachelor of
Science degree in physics at Loyola
College in Chennai, India, one of
Prahalad's professors recommend-
ed him for an internship at a Union

election cycle in ways he hadn't
expected.
"It's amazing how similar start-
ups are to political campaigns,"
Snyder said. "You need a vision, a
business plan and then you need to
move along that path."
For Snyder, that path revolves
around a "10-point plan," which he
says is the key to a better future for
Michigan.
The plan emphasizes job cre-
ation, tax and educational reforms
and measures to keep residents in
the state as well as attract new ones.
Snyder said the plan will "move the
ball ahead in a way that impacts real
people."
But getting the ball rolling in the
first place wasn't easy, Snyder said.
He explained there was a point
during the race when it seemed so
unlikely that he would win the pri-
mary race that some polls actually
placed him in the margin of error.
"I was at like 2 percent," Snyder
said.
gaining team," Anderson said in
a statement. "This will build on
achievements of the previous two
contracts. I think it's the best one
yet"
In a phone interview yesterday,
University spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald also praised the agreement's
ratification.
"The University is pleased with
the news of the ratification and is
encouraged that the tentative agree-
ment received such strong support,"
Fitzgerald said.
And though both parties
expressed satisfaction after the con-
tract was ratified, they were not as
cordial toward each other through-

At 20, Prahalad was promoted to
manager - the youngest to hold
such a position in Union Carbide
history.
In 1964, Prahalad went on to
receive a postgraduate degree in
business administration at the
Indian Institute of Management.
During his time at the insti-
tute, Prahalad met his future wife
Gayatri, who he married five years
later. They had two children -
Murali and Deepa - and all three
family members attended Satur-
day's service and spoke in honor of
their husband and father.
In 1975 Prahalad graduated
from the Harvard Business School
with a Doctor of Business Manage-
ment. He wrote his doctoral the-
sis on multinational management
with classmate Yves L. Doz, who
attended the memorial on Satur-
day.
According to Business Week,
Prahalad's thesis was one of the
first studies to claim corpora-
tions needed to reorganize to
employ global strategies while still
addressing local needs.
After graduating from Har-
vard, Prahalad returned to India
to teach at the Indian Institute of
Snyder said he was discouraged
during this low point in the cam-
paign because few people were will-
ing to support him publicly.
Nevertheless, Snyder won the
Aug. 3 Republican primary with
about 36 percent of the vote.
"I didn't say anything before, but
I actually thought we were going
to have a big win," Snyder told the
crowd.
Later during the talk Snyder
shifted his focus to the University
community, which made up the
majority of the audience, and called
it "one of the few shining stars" left
in Michigan.
If elected, Snyder said he plans
to implement measures that would
help greater numbers of financially
underprivileged students attend
schools like the University.
"We need to put a priority on
getting financial resources to the
people that have need," Snyder said.
Snyder also encouraged current
Universitystudents totravel outside
out the long negotiation process,
publicly expressing frustration with
each other.
However, when the tentative con-
tract agreement was reached last
month, both parties called it "a fair
compensation package for the 1,445
non-tenure-track instructors on
the three U-M campuses," in a joint
press release.
The package includes planned
salary increases for each ofthe three
years in the life of the contract. And
while LEO officials typically don't
like to plan such increases specifi-
cally in the contract, Halloran said it
was necessary because of past inci-
dents with University administra-

Management. Discouraged by the
lack of academic freedom in his
home country, Prahalad and his
family left India two years later
and moved to Michigan, where
Prahalad became a visiting profes-
sor at the University's Ross School
of Business.
In 1990, Prahalad and colleague
Gary Hamel, who could not attend
the memorial service but spoke of
Prahalad in a video tribute, pub-
lished "The Core Competence of
Corporate Strategy" in The Har-
vard Business Review. The paper
laid the groundwork for the con-
cept of "core competency," which
today industry experts identify as
a crucial factor in how businesses
operate.
The article, one of numerous
articles Prahalad published in The
Harvard Business Review, won the
McKinsey Prize and is one of the
most reprinted articles in the his-
tory of the magazine.
In a speech at the memorial,
Harbir Singh, one of Prahalad's
students in India, highlighted the
international success of one of
Prahalad's books "Fortune at the
Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicat-
ing Poverty Through Profits." He

said he's overheard businessmen
and businesswomen discussing the
book as far away as New Delhi and
South Africa.
In the book, Prahalad argues
that the people at the "bottom of
the pyramid," who are often dis-
missed as outsiders of the inter-
national economy, are actually the
future of the global market.
Singh said merely reading the
comments about the book on Ama-
zon.com is enough to understand
the book's impact.
"This is one of the most refresh-
ing set of ideas people have seen on
how poverty can be alleviated, and
it's not about charity, and it's not
about government policy," Singh
said. "It is certainly beyond those
things."
Praveen Suthrum, a student who
helped Prahalad with research for
"Future at the Bottom," told those
at the ceremony that he thought of
Prahalad not only as a professor,
but also as a mentor, critic, friend
and guru, which he defined as "a
medium or channel that gives you
a glimpse of truth."
"When I reflect back and look
at all this, that's what he was. He
was a guru," Suthrum said. "And

when I think of him this way, he
remains a constant, and I don't feel
obligated to talk about him retro-
spectively."
Throughouthis career, Prahalad
received several honors including
the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman -
awarded by the president of India
to men and women who make
exemplary contributions in their
fields - and the Padma Bhushan -
the third highest civilian award in
India.
The ceremony, attended by
about 100 people, concluded with
speeches from Prahalad's chil-
dren. Deepa described her father's
ability to build bridges between
theory and practice, east and west,
rich and poor. Murali highlighted
the core attributes he saw in his
father, including a relentless pur-
suit of excellence, a deep empathy
for those less fortunate, a comfort
with himself and an ability to rec-
oncile some of life's most challeng-
ing extremes.
"He was an extremely consis-
tent person and much of what was
experienced on the outside was
experienced perhaps with all the
more added intensity at home,
Murali said.

tional growth in struggling cities
like Detroit.
"It's so important to get Detroit
back on a positive path to success
tors.
Inpastcontracts, lecturers' salary
increases were often tied to faculty
raises.
"The University did not want to
be in the same position in another
year or two years, or three years
later where there was a disagree-
ment on what the raise was that lec-
turers would get," Halloran told the
Daily last month. "So they insisted
on negotiating for a fixed percentage
raise and that's why that language is
there."
Language in the tentative agree-
ment specified that lecturers would
see a 2.5-percent increase in 2010
and 2011 and a2.75-percent payraise

because Ann Arbor is good, but it's
not good enough," Snyder said.
Throughout his speech, Snyder
compared a good government to
an efficient business operation -
in 2012.
Additionally, lecturers will be
more gradually introduced to the
University's new modified health
insurance cost sharing program.
The new cost sharing burden will
not be fully experienced by lecturers
until 2012 and even then, lecturers
with a 50- to 79-percent appoint-
ment will be safeguarded from any
negative impacts on their salaries.
The minimum salaries lectur-
ers are allowed to receive will also
be increased by $1,300 over the life
of the contract and lecturers will
receive a $500 "base salary adjust-
ment" in Sept. 2012.
And while LEO members over-

manager.
"I think I'm one of the first man-
agers running for office in a long
time," Snyder said.
whelmingly approved the tentative
contract agreement, Halloran told
the Daily last month after the tenta-
tive agreement was announced that
she views this as only the first step
towards closing the gap between
lecturers and other faculty at the
University.
"From our perspective, it's a small
step towards what we're looking fo,
but it's the beginning of what we're
hoping to be a continual process..
that we can continue to make these
kinds of salary adjustments over
time because of the tremendous gap
between what lecturers getpaid and
what tenure track faculty get paid,"
Halloran said.

No glimmer on 'Sparkle'

Art predicts Detroit

Blonde Redhead's latest
is dull, emotionless
synth-pop
By JOSHUA BAYER
Daily Arts Writer
If you're looking for some relatively
not-lame background music for your
next hipster yoga circle,
Blonde Redhead's Penny *
Sparkle will fit the bill
just peachily. Blonde
But that's a damn R
shame, considering the
band's status as one of the Penny Sparkle
more consistently inter- 4AD
esting outfits on the indie
shiver-pop circuit.
With past albums, Blonde Redhead has
always found innovative ways to bridge
the gap between spidery art house ten-
sion and an unadulterated pop sensibil-
ity, crafting arrangements that hover like
spectral cobras. At its best, the band is a
master at hitting eerie pockets between
lusty warmth and ghostly intrigue, waiting
to strike while subduing with deceptively
bubble-gummy melodies.
Penny Sparkle, however, finds the
group lounging around in a frustratingly
mild middle region, doling out innocuous
imelodies that are neither threatening nor
hummable. While the tracks are all har-
monically sound and pleasant enough to
listen to, Sparkle often winds up sounding
like incredibly high-end spa music, or a
candidate for the infamous "chilltronica"
genre.
"Will There Be Stars," for instance, is
like a cardboard cut-out of the band's sig-
nature creepiness, with Amedeo Pace's
watery vocals washing over cheap-sound-
ing drum pad bloops and sci-fi synths that
sound like they're on the same settings as
the ones used in the "X-Files" theme song.
Elsewhere, the music is too docile to
even sound purposefully tacky. "Penny
Sparkle" and "Love or Prison" are essen-
tiallyinterchangeable, with Kazu Makino's
wispy voice floating competently around
meditation-music synth drones without
ever really sticking.
While it's clear that the band was going
for a more subdued vibe with Sparkle,
the end result is an album that's peaceful
enough to listen to in full but too harm-

By HEATHER POOLE
DailyArts Writer
Decades after enjoying its pinnacle as
the "Motor City," Detroit's once-great
legacy is now fading fast in the minds
of many University students. Yet a new
exhibit, "Considering the City" - hosted
by the School of Art &
Design's Work " Detroit sjig
gallery - contemplates t
the future of Detroit as
the city goes through Tuesday to
immense transforma- Saturday,i1
tions as an urban land- a.m.to4 p.m.
scape. until Oct. 8
According to the Work - Detroit
School's website, "Con-
sidering the City"
examines "the new ways of using and
interpreting urban spaces for the people
that live in them" and focuses in particu-
lar on Detroit. The exhibition invites art-
ists, designers, architects, urban planners
and social practitioners to weigh in on the
unpredictable potential Detroit holds.
Inspired by the close proximity of
Ann Arbor to Detroit, Charlie Michaels,
School of Art & Design graduate student
and curator of "Considering the City,"
centers this exhibition on the concept of
cities as "constantly shifting organisms."
"When I got here, to Ann Arbor, I was
really interested in the fact that Detroit is
so (geographically) close, but Ann Arbor
and Detroit are so different," Michaels
said. "I think there's a lot of people inAnn
Arbor or in this area that don't use the
resources that Detroit has to offer."
"Now there is ... this more real plan
to shrink Detroit and I think it's a really
important time to revisit that idea," he
added.
Michaels is obtaining his masters of
fine arts at the University, working exten-
sively in photography. As his work dem-
onstrates, Michaels is influenced by the
dynamics of cities like Detroit.
"My own studio work and my research
for my work focuses a lot on cities and
(their) changing nature," Michaels said.
By displaying the works of various
artists who responded to the transfor-
mation of Detroit, this exhibit raises
various economic, architectural and
social issues that will inevitably shape
the city's future.
"Anything that has to do with urban
issues, socioeconomic issues, particu-
larly in challenged areas, seems to be a

real buzz topic," said Stephen Schudlich,
director of exhibitions at the Work -
Detroit gallery. "Detroit is such a ripe
study ground for that sort of process and
non-process that it just seemed ... natu-
ral."
The exhibit features an array of medi-
ums, ranging from painting and photog-
raphy to installations, literature and even
a LEGO model of Detroit.
"Considering the City" also welcomes
the responses of "people that are not con-
nected to the arts community but are
doing things that affect life in the city,"
Michaels said.
Despite the varying political, aesthet-
ic, social and economic views and atti-
tudes toward the future of Detroit, both
Michaels and Schudlich emphasized the
open-mindedness of the exhibit.
"I think it is open to interpretation and
I think that is what is exciting about it,"
Michaels said. "The debate over what
happens to Detroit next or postindustrial
cities next. There's multiple opinions,
multiple ideas of what we can do, what we
should be doing (and) what we shouldn't
be doing."
"We like to have people ... draw their
own conclusions and talk about the topic
at whatever level they choose," Schudlich
added.
Additionally, "Considering the City"
aims to connect the various disciplines

that are affected by the development of
cities like Detroit, as well as an instru-
ment to hear views that speak outside of
the University community.
"We're able to bring in a dialogue from
a number of artists and creative people
that aren't associated solely with the Uni-
versity of Michigan," Schudlich said. "So
we get a lot of cross-pollination here."
Though "Considering the City" is not
based within the familiarity and com-
fort of Ann Arbor, the exhibit reaches
out toward a larger community, which
includes University students - if they
can embrace the spirit of the exhibit and
make the trek to Detroit.

less to demand repeat visits. It's the type of
record that works on a bell curve: floating
byon first listen, growingonyou steadily as
you unravel its yin-yang melodies, and then
shriveling up once you realize you'd rather
be listening to something more exciting.
"Here Sometimes" and "Not Getting
There" at least sport legitimate hooks, the
former ratcheting up a slow-burn chord
progression over an assembly-line drum
machine and the latter pitting angsty, New
Wave-y guitars against hot-and-cold synth
lines for some refreshingly edgy synth pop.
But both tracks feel strangely half-assed
and synthetic like the rest of the album,
begging for a burst of energy and conse-
quence.
Not surprisingly, the one emotionally
resonant track, "My Plants Are Dead," is
also the haziest, with swampy guitar mur-
murs hanging over a crisp trip-hop beat

like a bleary-eyed mist. The song actually
feels complete, with its crunchy founda-
tion merging seamlessly with the cloudy
instrumentals and Makino's bittersweet
vocals, emphasizing the unnaturally stag-
nant dead space on the rest of the album.
While the entirety of Sparkle is intricately
produced and fussed over, it still manages
to come off as canned and tinny, leaving
listeners to wonder if Redhead's stellar 23
would have retained the same mystique
without all the drenchy reverb.
For purists who felt that 23's lush studio
sheen was overly airbrushed and indul-
gent compared to the leaner menace of
the band's previous work (see: Misery is a
Butterfly, Melody of Certain Damaged Lem-
ons), Sparkle should offer a mildly diverting
alternative. But for anyone else, Redhead's
latest is nothing more than a well-oiled
snoozefest.

Grigoriev and Pierre grow closer
in their quest for Soviet takedown,
they begin to alienate their fami-
lies in the process.
Slowly, as the two spies spin
their webs of deception, they
migrate away from the wives and
children to whom they cannot
reveal their secrets, their gradual
slip from reality comparable to
the 2006 German film "The Lives
of Others." The result is a rather
touching, unglamorous portrait of
spies who cannot return to their
real lives after exercising such
duplicity in their jobs, or perhaps
because they were never part of it
in the first place.
Dismayingly, though, the film
begins to lose all momentum as it
approaches the last 20 minutes.
As the plot begins to twist into
more and more unsolvable knots,
"Farewell" becomes reduced to an
externalized account of political
espionage, rather than the inter-
nal one it had been building up
to. Finally, when Willem Dafoe
("Antichrist") appears, making
a brief cameo as the mustache-
twirling American CIA agent with
a dastardly plan up his sleeve, the
film loses all shred of subtlety. The
ending is pretty much what you
would expect from a Cold War
spy movie - a dramatic, climactic
standoff set in the icy landscape
of the Soviet Union, accompanied
by the delicate plinks of a piano
from the composer Clint Mansell
("Requiem for a Dream"). The ten-

disappeared.

Robinson leads comeback
in legendary performance

r!!

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - With just over three
minutes remaining on the clock, sophomore quar-
terback Denard Robinson led his offense to the
huddle. Seconds before, junior Notre Dame quar-
terback Dayne Crist had given the Irish the lead on
an incredible 95-yard touchdown pass to tight end
Kyle Rudolph.
But Robinson's poise - which the Michigan
coaches had been praising all offseason - kept him

confident as he met his teammates.
"It's time to put it in," he said to the other 10
members of the Wolverine offense. "It's time to put
the game away."
Facing a third down on the final drive, Robinson
looked over to redshirt sophomore wideout Roy
Roundtree. Roundtree winked at him. "Big play-
ers make big plays," Roundtree had told him in the
huddle.
Robinson smiled back with a big grin and took
his place under center.

'D' does just enough in close victory

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - With six seconds left and
the ball placed on the 27-yard line, Notre Dame still
had a chance to win the game. A stadium full of anx-
ious gold, blue and green-clad fans waited as Dayne
Crist dropped back and stood in the pocket for what
seemed like an eternity.
The Michigan defense had already allowed 535
yards of total offense to the Fighting Irish, includ-

ing multiple long touchdown passes. Even after
Michigan sophomore quarterback Denard Robinson
scored the go-ahead touchdown with 27 seconds left
in the game, the Fighting Irish still had a pulse. Crist
marched Notre Dame 47 yards down the field to
that point. None of the previous plays mattered now.
With a four-point deficit to overcome, Crist needed
to connect on just one more touchdown pass to win.
As time slipped away, thousands of eyes locked in
on Crist as he lofted a ball high and toward the end
zone.,

Where does Denard's 502 rank?

Wolverines notch pair *
of wins on home turf

As sports fans, it's a rare
occasion to sit back and
realize we are indeed
watching history unfold before our
eyes.
I've witnessed a few of these
events - I was in the stands as
Philip Brabbs kicked the game-
winning field goal against Wash-
ington in 2002 and, on the flip side,
I looked on in horror when Appala-
chian State did
the unthinkable
in 2007.
But it's even
more excep-
tional to see
an individual
performance
so magical RYAN
that one player KARTJE
gives us tingles
the rest of the
night.
As I stood on the sideline for
Denard Robinson's final drive
against Notre Dame, I felt a part of
one of those moments. I watched
him take off on an astonishing
87-yard run for a touchdown and
make clutch throw after clutch
throw.
But that final drive was his tour
de force, the icing on his abnor-
mally large cake. And we're only
talking about the guy's second
start ever.
It's probably (definitely?) too
soon to utter the "H" word in
regards to Robinson, despite the
fact that he leads the NCAA in
rushing yards through week two
- as a quarterback. But I started
thinking, where does this rank
as an individual performance in
Michigan football history?
Plenty of dynamic players have
come through Ann Arbor - three
Heisman winners, several who
came close. But none of them have
done what Denard did on Saturday.
And that's why he makes my top-
five list:
5. BRAYLON EDWARDS VS.
MICHIGAN STATE, 2004
There are seldom opportunities
for a wide receiver to absolutely
take over a game. But against
the Spartans in 2004, Edwards
turned in arguably the single
greatest performance by a Michi-
gan wide receiver in program

history.
With six minutes remaining and
the Wolverines down, Edwards
pulled down a Chad Henne lob for
a touchdown that made him look
like a man among boys.
Three minutes later, he did it
again, just with more authority.
And then in triple overtime,
Henne looked in Edwards' direc-
tion again.
But this time, the Spartans
almost seemed scared to cover No.
1 out of fear of humiliation. He
scored, and Michigan pulled out an
amazing victory on his shoulders.
There have been plenty of
great wideouts at Michigan, but
Edwards' performance in such
a close rivalry matchup was the
best.
4. DENARD ROBINSON
VS. NOTRE DAME, 2010
He may be No. 4 on this list, but
what makes Robinson stand out is
that he singlehandedly demolished
the Irish in just his second start.
No one on this list can claim any-
thing similar.
I'm still trying to grasp how one
human being can run and pass for
502 yards total. But that's the best
part about Denard: He'll probably
prove, at some point, that he can
do better.
The game's consequences may
not match the others on this list
when all is said and done, but the
pure shock factor from Robinson's
mass destruction of quarterback-
ing boundaries and the ultimate
enjoyability of a player unlike any
Michigan fans have ever seen
should put him on this list by
default.
Consider my shoelaces untied.
3. TIM BIAKABUTUKA
VS. OHIO STATE, 1995
Talk about a man amongboys.
In a make-or-break game for Ohio
State that had major Rose Bowl
implications, Biakabutuka stiff-
armed literally every member of
the Buckeye defense on at least one
occasion. With 104 yards after just
five carries, Touchdown Tim didn't
need holes, he made them.
"Just give it to Tim," the TV
analysts said on several occasions.
And they did, even though Ohio
State knew what was coming on

Charles Woodson's individual performance against Ohio State in 1997 ranks among

nearly every play. Sure sounds
familiar, doesn't it?
Biakabutuka finished the day
with 313 yards, the second most in
the history of Michigan football.
But with the entire team on his
back, Biakabutuka ruined the Buck-
eyes' postseason.
That sure counts for something.
2. TOM HARMON
VS. OHIO STATE, 1940
If you're a fan of stats, Harmon's
part in Michigan's 40-point shut-
out victory should make your head
spin.
The Heisman Trophy winner
that year, Harmon put up three
touchdowns on the ground, two
through the air, intercepted three
passes, (breath), kicked four extra
points and punted three times at
a clip of 50 yards per punt - the
original one-man show.
Harmon's performance was so
special that the entirety of Ohio
State Stadium stood up and gave
him a standing ovation. That, no
matter how glossy the stats, will
never happen again.
Neither will Old 98's statline.
I know, I know, Denard did punt
against the Irish. But when Rodri-
guez puts him out at cornerback,
then we'll talk about him showing
up Harmon.

1. CHARLES WOODSON VS.
OHIO STATE, 1997
As rare as it is for an offensive
player take over a game like the
other four on this list did, it's even
more rare to see a defensive player
do the same - and do it better.
With a national title berth on the
line, Woodson made Ohio State's
lead wideout David Boston - a 6'2"
man-child - look absolutely puny.
And when the Buckeyes were driv-
ing, Woodson made an interception
in the endzone to halt the drive.
The offense had been slow
all game long, but with Wood-
son streaking across the field on
offense - with definite cred for
playing both ways - he pulled
down the game's most important
catch, a 37-yarder that set up Mich-
igan's only offensive touchdown.
And after being a moderate punt
returner all season long, Wood-
son took his most important punt
return to the house to clinch the
game for the Wolverines. His Heis-
man moment eventually led to a
national title for Michigan.
A defensive player may not win
the Heisman for a very long time
because none outside of Woodson
have deserved it. And in his Heis-
man game, Michigan fans saw a
historical performance that may
never be rivaled.

Saad brothers lead Blue in Seattle

tive.
Their first regular-season road
trip, which the Wolverines fin-
ished with a 1-0-1 record, marked
a return to the hometown of red-
shirt senior goalie - and recently
named co-captain - Chris Blais.
And according Michigan's
other team captain, senior mid-
fielder Alex Wood, the tourna-
ment was a trip "Blais has been
raving about for two years now."
"It's great to finally get to his
stomping grounds," Wood said.
"He made two very big saves for
us (on Friday) to keep us in there.
That's what we expect from him.
"We don't want to leave him out
to dry, but he can keep us in the
games. It was great to see him get

the shutout in his hometown and I
know that he was excited for anoth-
er win and a shutout."
In Friday's game, the Wolver-
ines (2-1-1) took on the University of
Illinois-Chicago - and took care of
business, winning 2-0. The Michi-
gan offense fired on all cylinders in
this match, posting 23 total shots
with 13ongoal.
Freshman forward Soony Saad
scored the first Wolverine goal in
the 69th minute and was assisted
by senior midfielder Justin Meram.
Meram took a shot that deflected
off the UIC keeper before Soony's
rebound found its way to the back
of the net.
Even after Soony's goal, Michi-
gan continued to keep the pres-
sure on the UIC defense and was
rewarded when senior captain Alex
Wood's shot from three yards found
the back of the box.
Meram earned his second assist
on the day on Wood's goal, as his
cross pass set it up.
"This game was the type of game
where early on it was a stalemate,"
Soony said. "It seemed like we were
never going to get a goal, like we

were knocking on the door forever.
"We just kept coming and we
caught a break where (Meram) took
a shot and I came in to the rebound
and that goal really opened up the
door for the second goal. The other
team was pressing for the equalizer
and they didn't get it."
But Sunday's game against Seat-
tle University started on a drasti-
cally different note.
Seattle had seven shots in the
first 15 minutes, compared to just
one for Michigan.
The Redhawks came into Sunday
with a 0-3-0 record, but managed to
score two goals on Michigan in the
first half.
Seattle's first goal came at 11:31
and reflected the Redhawks' early
offensive tempo. The second Seat-
tle goal came just before halftime
off a broken pass from Michigan's
defense.
"In terms of what Seattle did,
they sat in and did a good job play-
ing off the counter attack," Michi-
gan coach Steve Burns said, adding
that it "kind of opened the game
up because we committed a lot of
resources to go forward and hold
possession."
But the Wolverines continued
to battle, attacking the opposing
keeper with 36 shots and 11 shots
on goal in the game.
And Michigan's persistence
helped the team complete its
second-half comeback, as sopho-
more midfielder Hamoody Saad
drained a free kick for a goal at
75:18 and Soony followed with a
goal of his own with five minutes
remaining in the game.
All four of the Wolverines'
goals on the road trip came in the
second half of game action - giv-
ing the team confidence that they
can remain fresh until the game
goes final.
"Our attackers were top-notch
(Sunday)," Hamoody said. "I think
that when we go down a goal and
it goes into the last couple minutes,
the whole team is giving their full
100-percent effort. We know that
we're going to score."
Michigan comes back to Ann
Arbor to take on Oakland and
Notre Dame at home this week
before making a quick trip to
Madison to open Big Ten play
against the Badgers next Sunday.
With a win and a tie under
their belts from the weekend, the
Wolverines look ahead to playing
in a familiar setting. /

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - As
the Michigan football team
marched down the field in Sat-
urday's final minute trailing
24-21, there
was one ques- NOTEBOOK
tion rever-
berating through Notre Dame
Stadium.
Would the Wolverines have
to make a field goal to tie the
game?
After all, redshirt freshman
kicker Brendan Gibbons had
just missed two consecutive
field goals (a 39-yarder in the
middle of the third quarter and
a 40-yarder early in the fourth).
Would Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez send Gibbons out
there with the game on the
line? Or would he go to Gibbons'
backup, Seth Broekhuizen?
Fortunately for Rodriguez,
those questions never needed
answers. His sophomore sensa-
tion quarterback Denard Rob-
inson methodically moved the
Wolverines down the field, com-
pleting a huge third-down pass
to Roy Roundtree that set up a
short rushing touchdown.
"I can tell you this: I'm glad
we didn't have to try a field
goal at the end," Rodriguez
said after the game. "Not that
I didn't have confidence we
(could) make it. But after you
miss two in a row, psychologi-
cally you may not be ready to go
out there at the end. So we tried
to call a play to get a first down
and move forward."
After Michigan scored the
go-ahead touchdown with
27 seconds left in the game,
Rodriguez sent redshirt fresh-
man Broekhuizen, listed as
second on the depth chart, to
kick the extra point - which
was good.
ROBINSON
From Page 1B
Tate Forcier's comeback vic-
tory against Notre Dame last
season, Robinson marched the
Wolverines down the field on a
12-play, 72-yard drive - adding
to his record-shattering 502-
yard performance - capping it
with a two-yard touchdown run
that left just 27 seconds remain-
ing on the clock. His touchdown
gave Michigan the 28-24 lead
it needed to finish off the Irish
for the second year in a row and
give coach Rich Rodriguez a
marquee road win.
"(Robinson) played outside
his body," senior linebacker
Jonas Mouton said on the field
after the game. "I don't know,
it's his heart. He's not the big-
gest guy, but he has a big heart."
After showing his electrify-
ing potential in the Wolverines'
week-one win over Connecticut,
Robinson obliterated his own
records in week two against
Notre Dame.
With 244 yards through
the air and 258 on the ground,
Robinson became the ninth
quarterback in Football Bowl
Subdivision history to run and
pass for more than 200 yards
in a game. The last to eclipse
the mark also happened to be a

member of a Rodriguez offense
- Pat White, to whom Robinson
is often compared. In his time at
West Virginia, White ran for the
most yards of any quarterback
in FBS history.
More staggering than his
numbers, though, was that they
came in essentially a one-man
show, as the sophomore sig-

Rodriguez said he was disap-
pointed in the kicking game's
performance on Saturday, but
seemed optimistic about its
future no matter who plays next
week.
"Those guys can kick," Rodri-
guez said. "Brendan's a lot bet-
ter than he showed today. And
Seth Broekhuizen, I think he'll
compete. And I don't know who
will be the starter next week."
While the kicking game gar-
nered the most negative atten-
tion after Saturday's game,
special teams on the whole was
a concern.
True freshman Will Hagerup
punted five times in the game,
averaging 40.6 yards, but didn't
pin the Notre Dame offense
inside its own 20-yard line at
any point. One of his punts
missed so badly that it sailed
into the stands.
Again, Rodriguez didn't
appear too concerned.
"Will Hagerup is the first one
back there in that room, prob-
ably disappointed in some of
his punts, but he's a true fresh-
man," Rodriguez said. "He's got
a great future. I'm not worried
about him at all. He's going to be
fantastic."
BACKFIELD WOES: While
Michigan fans spent the week-
end salivating over Robinson's
502 total yards of offense, one
group of players might be con-
cerned about this number: 30.
That's the total number of
rushing yards from Wolverines
who tie their shoes. In other
words, the running backs and
anyone not named Robinson.
Sophomore Vincent Smith
and junior Mike Shaw both
averaged exactly 2.4 yards per
carry, and together, they had 12
rushing attempts.
Freshman Stephen Hopkins
had a 1-yard touchdown run in
the first quarter on his first col-
nal-caller accounted for more
than 94 percent of Michigan's
offense, including the longest
play from scrimmage in Notre
Dame Stadium's 80-year his-
tory - an 87-yard sprint to
give the Wolverines the lead in
the second quarter. Last week
against Connecticut, Robin-
son accounted for 80 percent
of the offense. But offensive
coordinator Calvin Magee said
after the game that Robinson's
performance, despite the high
percentage of total offense, was
possible because of the play of
his teammates.
"There's 10 other guys block-
ing and catching and doing all
of this stuff," Magee said. "He's
not throwing it to himself and
catching it himself. He's not
making blocks and turning
around and running it. There's
some other guys (who are) a part
of that. So don't worry about it."
Rodriguez said after last
week's game that, in hindsight,
Robinson's 29 carries against
the Huskies was much higher
than he would've wanted. But
in South Bend, Robinson was
just one carry short of his 29
from last week. That shoulder-
ing of the load brought a sig-
nificant number of questions
about Robinson's durability
following his record-shattering
performance.

"Of course you don't want
to run him that much," Magee
said. "But at this point, this
-team has been working awfully
hard to try and play as a team
and win some games. We're try-
ing to do whatever it takes right
now."
And Robinson's poised sec-
ond-half performance may have

legiate carry.
All in all, their performance
was less than impressive -
especially for a running-back-
by-committee system that's
expected to take some of the
load off Robinson's back. The
running backs know they need
to contribute more.
"I think we're going to have
to," Shaw said. "It's great that
(Robinson) can do this, but
sooner or later we're going to
step up and make big plays.
We're working to get better and
the coaches are looking forward
to what we can do. But right
now it's Denard's show."
RECORD-SETTING DAY: Not
only did Robinson dazzle fans
on Saturday, but he also broke
some records with his perfor-
mance.
He set Michigan's single-game
individual record for total offense
with his 502 yards (breaking his
own record of 383 from last week
against Connecticut).
He set the Big Ten quar-
terback single-game rushing
record with 258 yards.
He also became the ninth
quarterback in NCAA history to
rush and pass for 200 yards or
more in a game. The last player
to accomplish the feat? Rodri-
guez's own Pat White at West
Virginia, who did it against
Pittsburgh in 2006.
For all this, Robinson became
the first player ever to earn the
Walter Camp National Offen-
sive Player of the Week honor
for two consecutive weeks.
For Robinson, who Rodri-
guez has said is very humble,
these records and statistics
don't mean much. At the post-
game press conference on Sat-
urday, he wasn't even aware of
his numbers.
"I'm a team player, and I don't
worry about the stats," Robin-
son said.
been the only answer to Michi-
gan's woes after halftime.
Leading 21-7 at the half, the
game's momentum strongly
leaned in Michigan's favor, as
Notre Dame junior quarter-
back Dayne Crist missed much
of the first half with an injury
to his right eye. But the Irish
held in the game long enough
for Crist .to return, and with
their starter back, the Irish
charged down the field on two
separate touchdown drives to
take the lead.
With little help from the Wol-
verines' special teams play after
redshirt freshman kicker Bren-
dan Gibbons missed two make-
able field goals in the second
half, the heightened drama of
a possible game-winning drive
seemed to do little to affect Rob-
inson, despite the fact that his
only previous game-on-the-line
experience ended in an inter-
ception at Iowa last season.
Quarterbacks coach Rod
Smith said after the game that
that poise is something the
players and coaches knew about
Robinson all offseason. But
Smith told the sophomore quar-
terback after the game that even
he was shocked and impressed
by his growth on that final
drive.
"(I said,) 'Son, you don't know
how much you have matured,

just that one drive, just moved
you forward light years (from)
where you need to be,' " Smith
told reporters after the game.
"It takes experiences like that
in order for quarterbacks to
grow - especially young ones."
Added Rodriguez: "I've got
my shoes untied in honor of
Denard."

DEFENSE
From Page 1B
But it was too high. And the
Fighting Irish's last chance land-
ed just to the right of the Michi-
gan marching band.
"I was a little concerned, but we
practice that play over and over,"
redshirt sophomore safety Jordan
Kovacs said after the game. "It
was kind of scary that they made
it that far, but they threw it out of
the end zone."
The Wolverines' defense
responded when it most desper-
ately needed a stop in Saturday's
28-24 win over Notre Dame.
Michigan did allow the fourth
most yards in school history - the
second highest total in a win-but
it didn't allow the yards when it
mattered most.
It had also answered the call
when the first half was coming to
an end. Nate Montana, who was
playing while Crist sat out with
an injury, led a drive down to the
three-yard line with only three
seconds remaining. Instead of
kicking the easy field goal, Notre
Dame coach Brian Kelly called for
Montana to throw the ball. His
pass also ended up closer to the
fans than a receiver.
Michigan had a 21-7 lead
at haftime after the stop. And
the Wolverines built that lead
because of the defense's ability to
slow down Notre Dame's offense
after its opening touchdown
drive. After that series, Crist left
the game with an eye injury, and
freshman quarterback Tommy
Rees replaced the junior signal
caller.
On the second snap of his colle-
giate career, Rees handed the ball
off to senior running back Arman-
do Allen, who flipped it back to
Rees. The flea flicker didn't work.
Rees threw the ball, and senior
linebacker Jonas Mouton stepped
in front of the intended receiver
for the interception.
Later in the half, the Wolver-
ines once again showed they were
opportunistic. Redshirt sopho-
more cornerback J.T. Floyd picked
off Montana on a pass intended
for Michael Floyd - whom, last
week, redshirt junior defensive
end Ryan Van Bergen called the
best receiver Michigan faced in
2009.
Montana, a junior and former
walk-on, and Rees were limited
to just five first downs on the first
seven drives after Crist left the
game.
"There's so many guys on this
team who are going all-out," soph-
omore linebacker Craig Roh said.
"Mistakes are made up through
hustle and effort. Whereas, last
year, I don't think we were as

vicious going to the ball. We
weren't as bound together. This
year, these guys are just so hun-
gry: hungry for tackles, hungry
for sacks, hungry for intercep-
tions - hungry to be great."
Although Michael Floyd was
held relatively in check, finish-
ing with five catches for 66 yards,
Michigan struggled to contain
the Fighting Irish's other great
receiving threat, junior tight end
Kyle Rudolph.
Crist connected with Rudolph
on a 95-yard touchdown pass
that gave Notre Dame the lead
with less than four minutes to
play. When Crist first returned in
the second half, he started with
a bang and hit freshman wide
receiver T.J. Jones for a 53-yard
touchdown pass.
"They seemed to rally around
Dayne Crist," Kovacs said. "He
played very well. When he was in
there they seemed to get a lot of
momentum. He's a good quarter-
back."
With Michigan clinging to a
four-point lead in the third quar-
ter, and the momentum squarely
on Crist's right arm, Mouton
tipped one of his passes which
was then intercepted by Kovacs.
But the Wolverine offense didn't
capitalize on the turnovers that
the defense forced. The Michigan
defense still held Crist and the
Fighting Irish offense to 51 yards
over the next three drives - all
ending in punts.
"I think we made some fresh-
men mistakes, but at the same
time, we held them for most of
the game," Kovacs said. "We con-
tained them pretty well. We gave
up a few big plays, but those are
things we're going to correct."
In the second half when Rob-
inson and the offense was stall-
ing, Michigan made sure Notre
Dame's did too. The opportunistic
attitude and key defensive stops
showed signs of an improved
defense.
Michigan defensive coordina-
tor Greg Robinson wasn't worried
about the amount of yardage that
his unit allowed. He pointed to
Rudolph's long catch and the 47
yards during Notre Dame's final
drive as outliers.
The last time the Wolverines
allowed so many yards in a win
was in 2002 against Illinois.
Michigan allowed 543 yards of
offense, but won 45-28. The other
two times the Wolverines allowed
more than Saturday's 535 yards,
they lost.
Because of how obscene Notre
Dame's offensive stats seem, the
defense's contribution to Satur-
day's win could easily be glossed
over.
"What won't be overlooked is
that we won," Robinson said.
