The University of Michigan 

Central Student Government 
met 
Tuesday 
night 
and 

discussed the introduction of 
many 
resolutions 
including 

reducing meal prices for Pell 
Grant students. Public Policy 
senior 
Alexandrea 
Somers, 

the author of the resolution, 

said she hopes to pass this 
resolution by early November 
after modifications are made 
by the assembly.

The 
resolution 
proposed 

would be a pilot program 
to combat food insecurity. 
Somers discussed how the 
program 
would 
allow 
Pell 

Grant recipients to apply for 
a reduced meal plan through 
University dining halls.

Fifty Pell Grant students 

per semester would receive a 
subsidized meal plan and pay 
only $7 per meal instead of 
the current rate of $16 a meal 
in the dining halls. Pell Grant 
recipients come from families 
who earn an income of less 
than $50,000 a year. Somers 
emphasized the importance 
of the initiative as it was one 
of the issues she promised 
to address in her election 
campaign.

“When I ran for CSG, one 

thing that ran out to me was 
that people said that they 
wanted to have (Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program) 
benefits for the dining halls,” 
Somers said. “I thought well, 
SNAP benefits are complicated, 
so what’s an easier way to start 
making those steps towards 
getting near that goal. Dining 
hall accessibility is valuable 
to off-campus and Pell Grant 
students, so that is the first 
step to make things happen.”

Some questioned whether 

Somers would be willing to 
extend the benefits to people 
who don’t qualify for the Pell 
Grant such as undocumented, 
international 
and 
graduate 

students. 
Somers 
said 
she 

would be open to the idea, but 
recognizes her time is running 
short as a senior.

“Things 
need 
to 
move 

quickly for me,” Somers said. 
“I’m a senior, and it’s almost 
the end of the first semester. 
This is a big need. As a low-
income student, I think it’s 
important that students aren’t 
starving. This university has 

Scott 
Vetere 
resigned 

as 
assistant 
coach 
for 

the

women’s 

gymnastics 
team 
Oct. 
15 

following 
a 
misdemeanor 

charge for alleged indecent 
or 
obscene 
conduct 
in 

public, as indicated by a case 
report 
obtained 
through 

the Michigan Courts website.

Vetere, 39, and an 18-year-

old student at the University, 

were each charged on Oct. 8 
after officers found Vetere 
and the student engaged in 
sexual activity in a parked 
car outside of an apartment 
complex at 625 Hidden Valley 
Club 
Drive, 
according 
to 

MLive. Vetere was arraigned 
Friday, Oct. 19 in Ann Arbor’s 
15th District Court, and his 
pre-trial is scheduled for Nov. 
14. The student’s arraignment 
is scheduled for Nov. 14, also 
according to MLive.

As part of a Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion initiative to start 
conversations about diversity 
within 
different 
fields 
of 

study, Dialogues on Diversity 
in Science was held Tuesday 
evening at the University of 
Michigan Power Center. 

Dialogues on Diversity, a 

social justice theater company, 
helped host the event, with 
executive director Ron Jones 
asking the audience questions to 
combat preconceived notions of 
diversity and privilege.

The end of the discussion 

consisted of scenario skits and 
discussion of how to handle 
situations 
such 
as 
sexual 

harassment, racially charged 
comments and bad reputations. 
While the event was scheduled 
to last from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., 
discussion 
about 
scenarios 

lingered 
for 
thirty 
minutes 

longer than expected. 

Some attendees said those 

in 
the 
sciences 
not 
value 

conversations 
on 
diversity, 

equity and inclusion, but instead 
regards them as “distractions to 
the lab.”

“There’s a culture clash when 

a minority or non-dominant 
culture come to an environment 
where it’s mostly a dominant 
culture,” 
Rackham 
student 

Omari 
Baruti 
said. 
“They 

don’t value conversations on 
diversity or you talking about 
diversity as much as the non-

dominant culture. Some things 
they say is that, ‘I’ve never had 
to experience these issues, so I 
feel like I shouldn’t have to talk 
about this.’ Or, ‘I feel like this 
is something we shouldn’t talk 
about in the lab. I don’t want to 
talk about it here. Maybe you 
guys can go elsewhere and talk 
about it, but not here.’ They feel 
like it’s a distraction from the 
productivity of the lab.”

Rackham 
student 
Angela 

Carter 
said 
that 
she 
has 

experienced 
microaggressions 

in her work and that the pressure 
of representing Black women to 
her peers and superiors takes an 
emotional toll.

“There’s 
a 
lot 
of 

microaggressions,” Carter said. 
“You go into the department, and 
you’re the person representing 
whatever identity you conform 
with. Me, being a Black woman, 
I’m representing Black women. 

Anything that I do wrong or 
do correctly is representing 
all Black women. So I have to 
always be correct and always 
right and always perfect. You 
have to be 100 percent on all the 
time.”

Rackham 
student 
Kaylin 

White said she was happy to 
see the number of people in 
attendance, but wished more 
faculty members were present. 

 
 
State 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 

D-Ann Arbor, proposed a bill 
last week to require all utilities’ 
energy in Michigan to come 
from renewable sources by 2050. 
The state of Michigan currently 
requires 10 percent of energy to 
come from renewable sources 
such as wind and solar, and 
this number will increase to 15 
percent by 2021.

Under 
Rabhi’s 
proposed 

legislation, House Bill 6466, this 
standard of renewable energy 
requirements would increase to 
25 percent by 2025, 50 percent by 
2032, 75 percent by 2040, and 100 
percent by 2050.

The 
bill 
follows 

a report released by the United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change that warned 
of the dangers that will face 
ecosystems and human health 
if global warming is not soon 
limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

“Part of the timing on this 

is we saw the International 
Commission that issued its dire 
predictions of what was going to

October 24, 1985

Eleven 
demonstrators 

protesting recruitment by 
the 
Central 
Intelligence 

Agency on campus, were 
arrested yesterday in the 
second day of protests in the 
Student Activities Building.

A total of 26 demonstrators 

were arrested in the two 
days of CIA protests. Most of 
those who were arrested are 
University students.

Protesters 
accused 
the 

agency of helping overthrow 
legitimate governments in 
Chile and Guatemala, as 
well as helping in trying to 
overthrow the Sandinista 
government of Nicaragua. 
They also say that the agency 
has 
helped 
train 
secret 

police in South Africa as 
well as “death squads” in El 
Salvador.

Despite 
the 
protests, 

Deborah Orr May, director 
of the Career Planning and 
Placement Office, said CIA 
recruiters interviewed all 
eight 
University 
students 

scheduled 
yesterday. 

Seventeen 
students 
were 

interviewed Tuesday.

The 
arrests 
yesterday 

came 
in 
two 
stages, 

beginning 
with 
four 

University 
students 
who 

were arrested early in the 
morning and charged with 
disorderly conduct.

According 
to 
Mark 

Weinstein, an LSA junior 
involved in the protests, six 
protesters 
were 
chanting 

“CIA go away” outside one of 
two back doors to the career 
planning office. Two were 
also banging on the doors, he 
said.

He said police opened 

the doors and arrested four 
of 
the 
protesters, 
while 

the other two — including 
Weinsten — fled.

“The cops just went, ‘get 

him, and him, and him, and 
him,’” said John Iscrow, an 
Ann Arbor resident who 
was arrested. Peter Rosset, a 
Rackham graduate student, 
Bill Michael, an Ann Arbor 
resident, and Bob Krause, 
an LSA junior, were also 
arrested.

“If chanting in front of a 

police officer is disorderly 
conduct, then we’re living in 

a totalitarian state,” Rosset 
said.

The other arrests came 

shortly afterwards. About 
30 students gathered outside 
the other back door to the 
office and began chanting. 
As police opened the door 
to let in a Detroit television 
news crew, seven of the 
protesters blocked the door 
open with their bodies and 
began chanting, “USA, CIA, 
out of Nicaragua.”

After May read them the 

trespassing act, giving them 
the choice of leaving the 
building or being arrested, 
police carried the seven 
to police busses waiting in 
front of the building.

Arrested 
were 
Phyllis 

Flora, an LSA junior; David 

Miklethun, an Ann Arbor 
resident; 
Dean 
Baker, 
a 

Rackham graduate student 
and president of the Rackham 

Student Government; Hugh 
McGunness, 
a 
Rackham 

graduate 
student; 
Carey 

Garlick, an LSA senior; John 
Hartigan, an LSA junior; and 
Steve Latta, an Ann Arbor 
resident. They were later 
charged with trespassing. 

All 
arrested 
yesterday 

were released on their own 
recognizance, 
and 
given 

court dates late this month 
and early next month.

May said she decided to 

read the trespass act because 
the protester’s changing and 
singing were disturbing the 
interviews. 

thousands of racist objects 
with the goal of educating 
people and using “objects 
of 
intolerance 
to 
teach 

tolerance.” 
The 
objects 

themselves 
range 
from 

postcards 
to 
newspaper 

clippings to lynching trees. 
Depictions of blackface and 
caricatures of Black people 
are displayed in a variety 
of mediums such as license 
plates and kitchen tools.

“Our 
approach 
is 
to 

document, not to serve as 
a shrine to racism, but to 
document 
the 
existence 

through material objects of 
attitudes, taste and values 
that permeated our culture,” 
Pilgrim said.

The museum is formatted 

so people can walk through 

and view the artifacts 
without a guide.

“We want people to 

experience the museum 
the way they experience 
it,” Pilgrim said.

Pilgrim spoke about 

the ways in which to 
conduct 
meaningful 

conversations 
about 

race. He described the 
tendency 
of 
educated 

people 
to 
“crush” 

ignorant 
ideas 
or 

thoughts that are not 
developed when having 
race conversations.

“Sometimes 
when 

you’re 
an 
instructor, 

there is this temptation 
to punish your students’ 
ignorance ... If you crush 
a person, you can’t teach 
them anything,” Pilgrim 
said.

LSA 
junior 
Alice 

Hanlon 
commented 

on 
Pilgrim’s 
idea 
of 

conducting meaningful 
conversations 
about 

race.

“(Using 
objects 
of 

intolerance 
to 
teach) 

It’s 
definitely 
a 
position 

that’s kind of against what 
we’ve been taught, especially 
in a very liberal place like 
Ann Arbor, I think we are 
pretty censored with good 
intentions,” Hanlon said. “But 
I think people do often feel 
like they have to kind of walk 
on eggshells when talking 
about things like this, like 
talking about race. I definitely 
think Dr. Pilgrim brought up 
so many good points about 
teaching and being able to 
have 
these 
conversations 

without feeling like you’re 
going to offend anyone just to 
actually learn.”

In a similar vein at the 

University, 
the 
Bentley 

Historical 
Library 
is 

expanding 
its 
efforts 
to 

record the histories of Black 
Americans on campus. 

“Having 
these 
records 

digitized is important because 
student 
activism 
is 
often 

erased in U-M’s diversity 
effort,” LSA senior Kayla 
McKinney, 
Black 
Student 

Union speaker told The Daily 
last week. 

Pilgrim 
concluded 
by 

speaking about the future 
expansion of the museum 
and the importance of future 
dialogues about race.

“We’ve got to grow up as a 

nation,” Pilgrim said. “We’ve 
got to be able to have real 
conversations.” 

LITE R ATURE VS TR AFFIC

ON THE DAILY: ART INSTALLATION LIGHTS UP LIBERTY STREET

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: ELEVEN MORE ARRESTS: CIA PROTESTED FOR SECOND DAY

A portion of East Liberty 

Street near the University of 
Michigan campus was shut down 
Tuesday as part of a “Literature 
vs. Traffic” project. Thousands 
of discarded books lined the 
streets and were illuminated 
at night with LED lights. Ann 
Arbor is one of several cities, 
including Toronto, New York 
and Melbourne, to participate 
in this art installation created 
by Luzinterruptus, a Spanish 
undercover art collective.

The event was organized by 

the Institute for the Humanities 
at the University in an effort to 
have literature fill the streets, 
allowing 
passersby 
to 
be 

surrounded by the written word.

“What was just a street will 

become a beautiful installation, 
as we bring the power of art, 
education, the written word, and 
free thought to the entire Ann 
Arbor community by essentially 
‘paving’ 
Liberty 
St. 
with 

thousands of glowing books,” the 
Institute’s website reads.

Luzinterruptus began public 

installations in Madrid in 2008 
and since has focused on using 
light as their main artistic 
material. “Literature vs. Traffic” 
has been one of their most 
popular exhibitions, using over 
10,000 books in one exhibition.

“A city area which is typically 

reserved for speed, pollution and 
noise, will become, for one night, 
a place for quietness, calm and 
coexistance (sic) illuminated by 
the vague, soft light coming out of 
the lighted pages,” their website 
reads. “Cars will eventually fill 

their space but for many of those 
who walked by this place that 
night, the memory of those books 
that took the same space will 
improve their relationship with 
these surroundings.”

Volunteers from the Ann 

Arbor community and University 
campus began working with 
artists the week before the event 
to prepare books and attach 
lights. Visitors who viewed the 
installation after 8 p.m. Tuesday 
were able to take books home for 
free.

director Kurt Svoboda offered 
the following statement:

“We 
learned 
about 
an 

incident with Mr. Vetere on 
Oct. 10 and suspended him 
that day. He resigned from his 
position on Oct. 15 during our 
disciplinary review process.”

Svoboda said he “can not 

comment” on the identity of 
the 18-year-old student.

Vetere did not respond to 

a request for comment at the 
time of publication.

Vetere was hired as an 

assistant coach in 2017 and 
was a former gymnast at 
Michigan, 
graduating 
in 

2003. A 10-time NCAA All-
American, he was a member 
of the 1999 team that won the 
national championship and 

served as an assistant coach 
for the men’s team for five 
seasons, from 2005-09.

Previously, Vetere worked 

with the women’s team at its 
summer camps for six years 
prior to his hiring.

Ethan 
Sears

Marcovitch also contributed

Engineering 
sophomore 

Tony Xavier was unanimously 
confirmed to the International 
Student Assembly seat. Before 
his confirmation, he discussed 
specific 
issues 
relating 
to 

international students that he 
hopes to address.

“For international students, 

there is one thing that University 
of 
Michigan 
completely 

neglects,” Xavier said. “There 
is no financial aid giving to 
international students.”

He went on to say many of the 

reasons the University does not 
offer aid is due to a stereotype 
of 
international 
students 

being wealthy. Xavier said the 
stereotype does not apply to 

him or other people he knew in 
India.

“There were three of my 

classmates back in India who 
could not come to the University 
because they found out the 
tuition was too expensive,” 
Xavier said.

After the CSG town hall 

meeting next Monday, CSG

their

effort 
to

to

University students.

Engineering senior Michael 

Nwansi 
proposed 
student 

organizations 
receiving 

funding from CSG to apply for 
compostable dining material. 
According 
to 
Nwansi, 
the 

Student Sustainability Initiative 
spends a lot of money on 
advertisements for students to 

apply for compostable material. 
He thinks the resolution will 
help the University’s goal of 
reducing landfill waste by 40 
percent in 2025.

Public Policy senior Alli Berry 

asked 
for 
CSG 
sponsorship 

for an event that will bring 
one Israeli orthodox Jewish 
person and one Palestinian 
person to campus to discuss 
their experiences and opinions 
on the current state of affairs 
in Israel. She said she knows it 
is a difficult topic to discuss, 
but hopes for a challenging 
yet respectful event and not a 
“kumbaya moment.”

The event comes at a time 

when the conflict is on the 
minds 
of 
many 
University 

students 
and 
professors, 

specifically 
in 
relation 
to 

Prof. 
John 
Cheney-Lippold’s 

recent decision to rescind his 
recommendation for a student to 

a study abroad program in Israel 
and the University’s subsequent 
sanctions against him. Berry 
hopes 
the 
discussion 
helps 

foster 
questions 
about 
the 

situation, not further divide 
campus.

“I think that this event could 

potentially leave people with 
more questions than they had 
coming in, but it’s an initial 
conversation,” Berry said. “And 
if we don’t sit down to start 
these conversations we will 
continue to see what we see on 
campus which are these isolated 
events 
hosted 
by 
multiple 

organizations that don’t foster 
diversity.”

CSG President Daniel Greene, 

a Public Policy senior, also 
emphasized how important it 
is to promote their Buses to 
Ballots initiative, which will aid 
students getting to the polls on 
Nov. 6.

“I was happy to see the large 

attendance 
numbers,” 
White 

said. “There have been so few 
events like this so far. Seeing that 
many people, and not just seeing 
those seats being filled with 
black people or the white LGBTQ 
crowd that comes out for their 
events and things. It was good to 
see people who aren’t necessarily 
part of some marginalized groups 
show up, or not visibly a part of it, 
which in one sense is a privilege, 
to be honest. I really wish that 
more faculty came, I really do. But 
that’s not on the event, that’s on 
the faculty again. But I’m glad that 
this is happening on a University 
level.”

The dialogue was not mandatory 

for every department, although 
the 
umbrella 
organization, 

Program in Biomedical Sciences, 
did require its members to attend.

Many 
attendees 

were concerned faculty members 
were not required to be in 
attendance. 

“I’m not as worried about what 

another person in my cohort thinks 
of me, to a certain extent — yes, as 
I am about someone who’s going 
to be writing a recommendation 
letter for me, someone who 
basically my future’s in their 
hands, someone who contributes 
to my daily happiness, because I 
have to interact with every day,” 
White said. “That is way more 

power. Having this community is 
great, but it’s really important for 
(faculty members) to figure it out.”

Sherrica Tai, who recently 

finished her post-doctoral studies 
in 
pharmacology, 
believes 
a 

top-down approach is key to 
increasing faculty attendance at 
diversity dialogues.

“Just like the scenarios that 

were put into play, everyone kept 
saying it seems to be the victim’s 
responsibility to change this, 
but it can also be the top-down 
approach where their superiors 
need to tell the faculty that they 
need to attend these trainings,” 
Tai said. “I don’t remember seeing 
too many of the faculty members 
in the session, especially when 
they asked. If they were told to 
go, if it was mandatory for their 
employment here, to participate 
in an event like this once a year or 
every other year, that would make 
a difference. Why am I being the 
one educated on this issue, but yet, 
faculty are not.”

Rackham student Chiamaka 

Ukachukwu, a first-year PIBS 
student, thinks dialogue trainings 
are 
necessary 
to 
increase 

appropriate 
conduct 
within 

workspaces.

“Some of these professors don’t 

care, they just don’t,” Ukachukwu 
said. “So having them do these 
mandatory trainings, if this is 
not something you care about or 
something that you don’t agree 
with, I don’t need you to agree, 
I just need you to treat me with 
respect. For me, I think one of 

the main points is just making 
sure there is some sort of action 
plan whether you agree with this 
and are genuinely interested in 
learning how to be a better person, 
or this is something you have no 
interest in doing, it’s mandatory. 
Just don’t touch my hair, don’t talk 
about Colored People Time. You 
don’t have to agree with, just don’t 
do it.”

White emphasized this point, 

saying such remarks make it 
difficult to concentrate in the 
workplace.

“It’s 
accountability,” 
White 

said. “It’s not like, ‘Hey, don’t hurt 
our feelings.’ It’s like, ‘You are 
making my life harder for me to 
get my job done right now.’ I hope 
people can be empathetic and not 
treat people poorly, but that’s not 
apparently the world we live in. 
For a morality standpoint, that’s 
not enough for scientists.”

Carter believes the issue lies 

in 
representation 
and 
thinks 

increasing 
minority 
faculty 

members could help mitigate it. 

“I think the issue is also 

looking at the faculty themselves,” 
Carter said. “There are only a 
few faculty members of color at 
that level. So the bottleneck isn’t 
necessarily grad school or even 
post-doctoral level. It’s the faculty 
level. That’s where the change 
needs to happens. If you get more 
women. If you get more people 
who identify as LGBTQIA. If you 
get more people of color. There are 
more voices. And you have more 
advocacy.”

Rackham 
student 
Rachael 

Baliira said providing financial 
incentive 
through 
grant 

funding would increase faculty 
participation.

“A huge part of a grant should 

be, ‘Have you done this training?’ 
so that professors get rewarded,” 
Baliira said. “Some people, they 
only count points and that’s how 
they measure success. They need 
it to be measurable. For some 
PIs 
(principal 
investigators), 

attending these training courses 
doesn’t help them or they don’t 
think it affects their research. 
It’s a waste of time. But if it did 
financially affect their research, 
they would have to do it.” 

Carter said organizations like 

the National Institutes of Health 
are requiring diversity in research, 
which could serve as a solution to 
similar problems. 

“A lot of funding agencies, like 

the NIH, are asking for that now,” 
Carter said. “They’re really, really 
looking for that. They’re looking 
for that in terms of our studies, just 
in terms of designing experiments. 
You have to do research on both 
sexes. And if you’re looking at 
social sciences, you have to look 
at all gender spectrums as well. 
They’re also looking for that 
in terms of people of color and 
other, as they said, non-dominant 
culture. That’s something that’s 
also happening. That could be 
where that initiative is.”

happen to our planet, not within 
the next century, but within 
decades and less if we don’t do 
something about climate change,” 
Rabhi said.

In 2011, the University of 

Michigan 
established 
a 
set 

of sustainability goals to achieve 
by 2025, chief among them to 
reduce 
campus 
emissions 
25 

percent below the 2006 level of 
680,000 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide-equivalent. In 2017, the 
University emitted approximately 
644,000 metric tons, representing 
a decrease of about 5 percent.

LSA senior Carly Rosenberg, a 

student studying in the Program 
in 
the 
Environment, 
voiced 

support of Rabhi’s bill and spoke 
on the importance of taking 
action at the state level to reduce 
harmful environmental impacts 
of climate change.

“I support this bill 100 percent,” 

Rosenberg said. “At the very least, 
I think it’s really important that 
he’s bringing in this bill because 
it’s calling attention to the fact 
that we need to do better and 
Michigan could be at the forefront 
of renewable energy and reducing 
our carbon footprint.”

DTE Energy, serving about 2.2 

million customers in southeast 
Michigan, 
has 
also 
released 

plans to improve upon their own 
energy sources. Earlier this year, 
the company announced plans 
to double their use of renewable 
energy over the coming four years 
through wind and solar energy. 
The company has also proposed 
plans to reduce carbon emissions 
by 80 percent before 2050, with 
the goal of having renewable 
sources power 40 percent of its 
energy by 2040.

Like Rabhi’s bill, DTE’s plan to 

increase use of renewable energy 
also has interim targets to meet 
their goals. These targets would 
reduce emissions by 30 percent 

before the late 2020s, 45 percent 
by 2030 and 75 percent by 2040. 
While Rabhi does expect some 
opposition from state energy 
companies regarding his proposal 
of 100 percent renewable energy, 
he also believes the 30-year 
timeline to accomplish the goal 
will allow companies adequate 
time to adjust.

Rabhi explained the current 

standards 
in 
Michigan 
have 

already set the precedent for 
increasing the use of renewable 
energy, 
and 
the 
bill 
would 

continue the practices that are 
currently used but would increase 
standards to higher percentages.

“There’s already a precedent 

and a mechanism in place to force 
the utilities to do these types 
of increases in terms of their 
ratio of alternative energy that’s 
generated of the total amount 
of energy,” Rabhi said. “The 
mechanism would really be the 
same that we currently have in 
the current system, and it would 
just be increasing the percentage 
standard … so that there’s sort of 
benchmarks and dates by which 
the utilities have to improve their 
renewable energy standard over 
that period of time, which is now 
only 32 years.”

Engineering 
junior 
Nathan 

Houghteling, who helped found 
the Michigan Energy Club last 
year and currently serves as its 
vice president, stated he agrees it’s 
necessary to set goals to reduce 
the impacts of climate change 
in the energy industry, and the 
energy industry is a place where 
this work can be done. However, 
he also thinks it is important to 
think about the implications of 
a 100 percent renewable energy 
plan.

“There’s a lot of complexities 

involved with renewable energy 
that 
our 
current 
grid 
isn’t 

equipped for,” Houghteling said. 
“A lot of it’s the intermittency 
of renewable sources, especially 
wind 
and 
solar, 
and 
to 

accommodate 
a 
100-percent 

renewable grid would require a lot 
of new technologies. What could 
potentially happen is the costs 
of these technologies don’t fall 
enough over the next thirty years, 
is we could see a dramatic spike 
in the price of energy per unit for 
residential users, for commercial 
users, for people across the board 
who are trying to buy energy if 
we’re trying to go to a 100-percent 
renewable grid.”

For Rabhi, the bill is a vision 

that sets goals for where the state 
and the country should be moving 
in terms of renewable energy.

“I wanted to set the goalpost of 

where we should be going. I don’t 
necessarily support an energy 
future that has any CO2 emitting 
sources, I think that we should 
ultimately have a carbon-free 
energy economy, and so I would 
like to see a day when Michigan, 
and quite frankly our country 
and our world, doesn’t have to 
use carbon to generate energy,” 
Rabhi said. “Instead of passing 
legislation or putting forward 
legislation that is sort of working 
around 
the 
margins 
of 
the 

problem, I’d like to actually aspire 
to something and address the 
actual problem.”

When considering the impacts 

this bill might have on students, 
Rabhi emphasized the effects of 
climate change on young people 
who currently see the climate 
changing and who might, in the 
future, witness even more drastic 
effects to the environment if steps 
aren’t taken soon to reduce global 
warming.

Rosenberg agreed and spoke 

on the actions the University 
is taking to reduce harm to 
the 
environment. 
She 
also 

highlighted the influence that the 
state legislative level could have 
on the University in continuing to 
improve their environmentally-
friendly decisions and projects.

“I know (the University of) 

Michigan has really lofty goals of 
becoming renewable and there’s 
a huge emphasis on serving 

local food in the dining halls 
and on campus to reduce carbon 
footprints,” Rosenberg said. “I 
think it could just be a really 
inspiring push for the University 
because obviously, they want 
to be at the forefront of what’s 
happening, and they’re already 
doing their part but it could be 
even more if the state of Michigan 
were to actually implement this 
… Long term, it could be really, 
really important in mitigating 
climate change.”

Houghteling 
urged 

consideration 
of 
the 
details 

that must be taken into account 
should a bill such as Rabhi’s 
be 
implemented. 
Specifically, 

he spoke on the importance of 
ensuring power is transmitted 
safely, 
efficiently 
and 
with 

a good quality of the power. 
Focusing on technologies that 
will be necessary for increasing 
renewable energy standards will 
be vital, he explained.

“I 
would 
say 
with 
some 

confidence that I don’t think 
there’s any grid on the scale 
of a state that could handle 
100 percent renewable energy 
today,” Houghteling said. “Just 
technologically it wouldn’t work, 
the grid would fail. I think that 
looking out towards 2050 there’s a 
lot of room for those developments 
to be made, but I’m looking at the 
technologies.”

Rabhi 
further 
spoke 
on 

activism he’s seen around campus 
on the issues of climate change 
and protecting the environment. 
He highlighted the impact this bill 
could have on living conditions in 
the future.

“It impacts us now and it 

impacts us in the future, and 
we need to be at the forefront of 
advocacy to push for a carbon-
free future,” Rabhi said. “I think it 
impacts everybody, and it impacts 
our climate, our environment, 
and ultimately it impacts each of 
our abilities to live on a planet that 
continues to be habitable into the 
future.”

Pieology, a pizzeria located 

at 620 E. Liberty St. in Ann 
Arbor, closed Tuesday, Oct. 
23.

On the restaurant’s front 

door hangs a handwritten 
sign 
stating, 
“due 
to 

unfortunate 
circumstances 

beyond 
our 
control, 
this 

Pieology location is no longer 
open for business.” 

University 
of 
Michigan 

student 
Jonah 
Erlich, 
an 

Engineering junior who said 
he eats at Pieology about 
every other week, read the 
sign with dismay. He said 
he was surprised, and noted 
the 
mystery 
surrounding 

“unfortunate circumstances.”

“I was mostly surprised,” 

Erlich said. “It kind of sucks, 
but I’m mostly just confused. 
Unfortunate circumstances is 
very vague.”

Pieology’s sudden closing 

reminded Erlich of BurgerFi 
closing in 2017, as they also 
notified customers with a 
sign on the door.

“What’s interesting is this 

is kind of how BurgerFi shut 
down a few years ago,” Erich 
said. “It was just kind of 
done one day. So I wonder if 
there’s some kind of city law 
or something.”

This 
Pieology 

location opened in summer 
2015, replacing the former 
Borders bookstore. It was 
the California-based chain’s 
first location in the state 
of 
Michigan, 
preceding 

the 
opening 
of 
a 
Grand 

Rapids location. It’s known 
for its customizable pizzas 
and salads.

According 
to 
MLive, 

Hughes Properties CEO Ron 
Hughes, landlord of 620 E. 
Liberty, said Pieology had not 
yet given notice of closing as 
of Tuesday.

Though Erlich feels sad 

about 
Pieology’s 
sudden 

farewell, he is sure he’ll 
keep eating delicious pizza 
elsewhere.

“There’s a lot of good pizza 

in Ann Arbor, so I’m not too 
worried,” Erlich said.

Daily Staff Reporter


I 

spent last summer working 
for 
a 
nongovernmental 
organization in Delhi, India. 
One weekend I took a day trip to 
see the Taj Mahal. On the bus back, 
I struck up a conversation with 
a fellow traveler — a deceptively 
young-looking Swiss man. He 
had 
spent 
months 
traveling 
throughout Latin America and 
Asia. Toward the end of the bus 
ride, he summarized his travels 
with a comparison. He told me 
“our” societies in the West are 
different than in non-Western 
countries. In the West, he told 
me, we share fundamental values 
and a way of life. He thought 
Argentina was more Western 
and thus felt more at home there. 
Back at my office in Delhi, one of 
my bosses would make similar 
comments, comparing “Western” 
America with “Eastern” India. For 
Westerners, it often seems that 
understanding foreign cultures 
is easier by comparing them to 
the West, which ostensibly has 
a similar set of values, or shared 
civilizational 
foundations. 
But 
comparisons 
that 
contrast 
a 
totemic “Western world” with the 
rest of the world are misleading 
and problematic.
The “West” is a racial and 
religious category. For a country to 
be Western, it must have a majority 
white population and a history of 
Christianity. Japan is a democratic 
country with a capitalist system 
but is not Western. Latin American 
countries are debatably Western 
just as they are debatably white. 
The 
categories 
of 
race 
and religion do not have the 
explanatory power to sufficiently 
understand another individual 
or society. To understand the 
differences between life in China 
and France today, you cannot 
simply consider the differences 
between Christianity and being 
white 
with 
Confucianism 
or 
Daoism and being Han Chinese. 
Doing so would not give you any 
meaningful 
understanding 
of 
the differences between modern 
France and modern China, nor 
of people that live in the two 
countries. But, when people talk 
about the “West,” they don’t 
usually think it as a religious 
or racial category, at least not 
consciously. So, what do people 
mean when they compare the 
“West” to the rest of the world?
The idea of Western values 
and civilization as fundamentally 
different from those of “Eastern” 
or non-Western societies stems 
from 
European 
imperialism. 
Europeans tried to schematize 
the vast swaths of people they 

encountered with the endgoal 
of 
maintaining 
imperialism. 
Guided by “social Darwinist” 
ideas, the scholarship of non-
Europeans by 19th-century and 
early 20th-century Europeans was 
terribly flawed. The comparison of 
the West and the rest of the world 
developed to simplify human 
diversity in a way that justified 
the subjugation of “primitive” 
races and peoples by an advanced 
assortment 
of 
“Western” 
countries.
For example, James Mill, the 
leading 
19th-century 
British 
“scholar” 
of 
Indian 
history, 
made sweeping conclusions that 
Indians and other non-Western 
colonial subjects were primitive. 
He shrugged Indian intellectual 
advances, 
like 
the 
creation 
of the decimal system, or the 
philosophically-rich 
Bhagavad 
Gita, as primitive “hieroglyphics. 
The British, he concluded, could 
spread their advanced, Western 
thought and technology to the 
primitive peoples of the East.
Today, the idea of the West 
versus the rest of the world is by no 
means as racist as it was during the 
age of imperialism. As Amartya 
Sen, a Nobel Prize-winning Indian 
economist, noted in his book 
“The 
Argumentative 
Indian,” 
Westerners who today rely on the 
simplifying comparisons to the 
West often do so because they 
want to understand other cultures 
rather 
than 
dominate 
them. 
Understanding 
other 
cultures 
through simplified comparisons 
with the West can help people 
intensify their own identities 
through contrast, as Edward Said 
noted in his theory of Orientalism. 
But, use of the comparison of the 
“West” and the rest of the world 
should still be avoided.
Today, the most politically 
influential version of comparing 
the West to the rest of the world is 
Samuel Huntington. His seminal 
book “Clash of Civilizations and 
the Remaking of World Order” 
asserted the world was divided 
into distinct civilizations that 
naturally opposed each other. He 
attributes the primary difference 
between 
Western 
civilization 
and other civilizations to the 
development of liberalism rooted 
in individual rights and liberties 
in the West. This way of thinking 
is rife with potential for prejudice.
The idea that non-Europeans 
have different, lesser civilizational 
values is a strong argument against 
an inclusive immigration policy. If 
too many non-Westerners live in 
the West, how long before “their” 
civilization 
replaces 
“ours”? 

Similarly, if each civilization has 
such distinct values and character, 
then maybe more progressive 
“Western values” of human rights, 
women’s rights or democracy 
are not legitimate outside the 
West. This civilizational way 
of 
thinking 
is 
attractive 
to 
Western 
xenophobes, 
Islamic 
fundamentalists 
and 
dictators 
alike. 
Luckily, it isn’t hard to discredit 
Huntington’s divisive argument. 
The development of individualism 
and liberalism can be found in 
non-Western 
histories. 
Early 
versions 
of 
private 
property 
existed in the Qin dynasty starting 
in 221 B.C. Mencius, a disciple of 
Confucius, thought anyone could 
become emperor on the basis of 
their merit. He also conceived of 
an early social contract by which 
an emperor could be overthrown 
if his rule did not benefit the 
people. In India, Amartya Sen 
argues in “The Argumentative 
Indian” 
a 
long 
tradition 
of 
heterodoxy, public reason and 
tolerance laid the groundwork 
for democracy. And Indian rulers 
like Ashoka and Akbar ruled a 
tolerant and multicultural empire, 
where religious tolerance, choice 
and 
interfaith 
dialogue 
were 
encouraged. And even in histories 
where finding liberal traditions 
are harder, like Japan’s, liberal 
ideas and governance can still 
be adopted, as is the case with 
modern Japan.
If you’ve taken any liberal 
arts classes on a modern college 
campus you might agree with 
me. A key principle for many 
liberal arts courses seems to be 
to warn you not to essentialize or 
generalize. Essentialism can be 
defined as “attributing natural, 
essential 
characteristics 
to 
members of specific culturally 
defined 
(gender, 
age, 
ethnic, 

“racial”, 
socioeconomic, 

linguistic...) groups.”
It is easy to look at the world 
through 
generalizations 
that 
explain 
dizzying 
difference 
and complexity through simple 
comparisons of different social 
groups. But that same thinking, 
though not inherently racist or 
bigoted, contributes to some of our 
biggest social problems. All forms 
of bigotry hinge on essentialism 
and 
generalizations. 
Thinking 
with less essentialism and less 
generalizations would promote 
individualism 
and 
tolerance, 
something that should attract both 
liberals and conservatives.

Algorithm prophecies
Y

ou might have heard 
the 
stories 
about 
the 
oracles 
of 
Greek 
antiquity, who were able to 
make prophetic predictions. You 
might be familiar with the name 
Nostradamus, whose prophecies 
are even nowadays picked up by 
those who predicted that 2012 
would be the end of the world. 
You probably made fun of these 
people’s beliefs in prophets, 
prophecies or anything related 
to inferring “facts” about the 
future because, as educated 
people, we know that we live in 
a chaotic world where the future 
cannot be predicted accurately.
 Still, our brains do not seem 
to have the same reactions when 
we talk about predictions. You 
can find article after article on 
how you can “How to predict the 
NBA with a Machine Learning 
system 
written 
in 
Python,” 
and paper after paper on an 
“improved model for predicting 
presidential election outcomes.” 
Stop using gods, and start 
using numbers and variables, 
change the word “prophecy” 
to “prediction” or, even better, 
“forecasting” and you suddenly 
have a “fact” about the future, 
that is worthy of academic 
papers and headlines. There 
is something about the idea of 
certainty that makes us shiver 
with delight. That need for 
certainty has brought us back to 
the same mindset that made us 
believe centuries ago in Pythia, 
the priestess of the Temple of 
Apollo at Delphi.
The 
problem 
with 
this 
mindset 
is 
not 
inherent 
in 
predictions. 
After 
all, 
scientists use models to make 
predictions to ease the process 
of understanding the world. 
Even though these techniques 
aren’t always accurate, they are 
modeling 
biological 
patterns, 
not the unpredictable behavior 
of humans or societies. Our 

fascination with peeking into 
the future, though, pushes us 
to use predictive models in 
psychology, trading or even 
politics. One algorithm was built 
to predict revolutions, but while 
it was capable of predicting an 
insurgency in Paraguay, it didn’t 
foresee the uprising in Ukraine. 
The people involved in building 
the model argued that the 
project’s end result wasn’t the 
prediction itself, but the testing 
of geopolitical theories. It was a 
way for researchers to rethink 
their 
theories, 
to 
reanalyze 
dogmas.
Predictive 
algorithms, 
though, have a way of creating 
new dogmas. The complexity 
of 
the 
models, 
the 
usually 
untraceable prediction process, 
combined with people’s greater 
trust in numbers than in fellow 
humans, makes us take the 
prediction’s result for granted.

predicts a defendant’s risk of 
committing another crime. After 
several years of being used by 
many states across the U.S., 
a 2018 study showed that the 
COMPAS model was no better at 
predicting a person’s likelihood 
of recidivism than volunteers 
randomly selected from the 
internet. Still, back in 2013, Paul 
Zilly was convicted of stealing 
a push lawnmower, leading the 
prosecutor to recommend a 
year in county jail. Instead, the 
judge suddenly overturned the 
plea deal, imposing two years 
in a state prison. His reasoning? 
He had seen Paul Zilly’s high-
risk score from COMPAS. He 
had 
allowed 
his 
judgment 
to be guided by a predictive 
model that was no better in its 
predictions than a random group 
of volunteers. 
Today’s predictive models 
are probably better equipped 

in making sense of the future 
than 
the 
prophets 
of 
past 
centuries. After all, these kinds 
of algorithms are fed immense 
amounts of historical data from 
which 
they 
start 
observing 
certain patterns. But what if 
particular 
human 
behaviors, 
economic 
fluctuations, 
and 
revolutions are bound to happen 
outside of historical patterns? 
That is where these algorithms 
fail.
The problem is when we 
forget that these predictions 
are doomed to have their 
failures. We forget because 
we rejoice in the idea that 
algorithms give us certainty 
in a world of uncertainties. 
We allow ourselves to get 
trapped in the same idea 
that made people seek out an 
oracle’s prophecies, the same 
idea that made them analyze 
Nostradamus’s 
writing 
to 
predict the 2012 apocalypse.
If we are so afraid of the 
coming revolution of artificial 
intelligence 
and 
algorithms 
that will take over our jobs, we 
should take a moment to reflect 
on the inherent imperfection 
of these systems, and on our 
own imperfections as humans. 
After all, adding these highly 
complex models into our daily 
lives only leads to one more 
element of uncertainty. The 
same uncertainty that we have 
been dealing with since the 
beginning of humanity. Once we 
can understand that technology 
will most likely add a layer of 
uncertainty to our lives, instead 
of playing into the false sense 
of certainty we’ve craved for 
centuries, we can start grasping 
the way our humanity will merge 
with algorithms.

On Oct. 17, the Washington 
Post published Khashoggi’s 
last 
column, 
which 
coincidentally described the 
realities of the Arab media 
community that contributed 
to 
the 
suspected 
motives 
behind his disappearance.
The column comments on 
the misinformation and lack of 
information available for Arab 
citizens due to the censorship 
and suppression tactics of the 
hegemonic governments that 
control the media. Khashoggi 
mentions 
the 
unfair 
imprisonment of his friend, 
Saudi writer Saleh al-Shehi, 
as an example of an atrocity 
that failed to capture the 
attention of the international 
community, an example that 
carries the somber irony of 
foreshadowing in the context 
of Khashoggi’s own situation. 
He goes on to caution the 
world about the free reign 
afforded to Arab countries 
when journalists are unable 
to 
safely report on 
their 
experiences.

It’s easy to feel helpless 
when confronted with issues 
of international scale. The 
nuances of global politics are 
difficult to comprehend, let 
alone influence, but in this 
instance, 
we 
as 
members 

of 
the 
media 
community, 
readers and writers alike, 
are 
presented 
with 
an 
opportunity to effect real 
change. 
Khashoggi’s 
final 
published paragraph imparted 
the need for more Arab voices 
to be elevated in publications 
through the creation of an 
independent 
international 

forum, aimed at addressing 
the 
structural 
problems 
affecting Arab societies today. 
We as an editorial board, 
wholeheartedly support the 
creation of such an entity 
and encourage our readers to 
support 
organizations 
that 
start initiatives to highlight 
Arab voices in journalism in 
the coming years. Regimes 
are temporary, but culture 
is 
durable, 
and 
cultural 
change cannot be effectively 
achieved 
without 
strong 
and loud voices with high 
platforms. As members of 
the global community, we 
are 
actively 
witnessing 
a 
political culture of predation. 
It’s 
our 
imperative 
to 
facilitate appropriate avenues 
for change when we can. 
Khashoggi spent a lifetime 
dedicated to the cause of 
illuminating the Arab world 
for Western readers. The least 
we can do is help other Arab 
journalists honor his memory 
by shining that same light for 
their own communities.

ELIAS KHOURY | COLUMN

The GOP assault on America
O

n Oct. 21, I spent a 
significant chunk of my 
Sunday night watching 
a debate between Sam Seder, a 
progressive talk radio host, and 
Charlie Kirk, the executive director 
of Turning Point USA. The guiding 
question of the debate was “Is 
President Trump helping the middle 
class?” Though I already knew the 
answer to this easy question — “no” 
— I decided to tune in any way.
I was very much familiar with 
the two participants prior to the 
debate. And while things did not 
go exactly as I expected, I cannot 
say that I was surprised by what 
transpired. Kirk was prone to 
incoherent rambling with outdated 
talking points sprinkled into stutter-
filled diatribes. Seder, on the other 
hand, took a far more metered-
out approach, pointing to specific 
Trump administration policies that 
have had catastrophic effects on the 
middle class.
One 
specific 
example 
of 
this was when Kirk touted the 
current administration’s cutting of 
regulation as advantageous to the 
middle class. Seder immediately 
fired 
back, 
citing 
specific 
environmental 
regulations 
that 
have been cut with projected death 
tolls in the tens of thousands. Kirk, 
subsequently, was silent.
Quickly 
coming 
to 
the 
realization that he was fighting a 
losing battle, Kirk began the flail. 
The errand boy of GOP megadonors 
adopted a new strategy in order to 
cut his losses: Go, and stay, off topic. 
In all fairness, this tactic worked 
quite well for Kirk as he was able 
to drag Seder into murky waters 
that, within the intended confines 
of this debate, were supposed to go 
uncharted. For a significant stretch, 
what was supposed to be a debate 
about the impact of the current 
administration’s policies on the 

middle class became an argument 
over 
the 
minutia 
of 
banking 
procedure. 
Nevertheless, 
any 
objective viewer came away with 
the impression that Seder, though 
not in peak form, won the exchange 
handily.
While the actual content of 
the debate left something to be 
desired, the timing was absolutely 
appropriate as it came in the wake 
of Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell’s call for massive cuts to 
the two most popular government 
programs — Social Security and 
Medicare. 
This 
fundamentally 
anti-democratic 
move 
was 
proposed under the guise of “fiscal 
responsibility.” Nothing could be 
more disingenuous.
This is the same party that 
drastically 
reduced 
government 
revenues by passing a tax cut bill in 
which 83 percent of the benefits went 
to the top 1 percent. They coupled 
this with increases to our already 
bloated military budget which has 
become less about national defense 
and more about lining the pockets 
of corrupt, evil war profiteers. This 
abuse of the American taxpayer is 
cronyism marketed as patriotism.
Unsurprisingly, the deficit has 
ballooned to $779 billion and is set 
to surpass $1 trillion by 2019. Rather 
than making the rich pay their fair 
share in taxes or attacking military 
waste (the Department of Defense 
spent $1.5 trillion on a fighter jet that 
doesn’t work), they have decided to 
continue their crusade to destroy the 
programs Americans hold dearest. 
They want to further eviscerate an 
already measly welfare state.
The Republican economic plan 
gives to the rich by taking away 
from the rest of us. This is not deficit 
hawkishness. It’s economic elitism. 
A 62-percent majority of Americans 
see the GOP as the party of the rich 
— this is why.

If one is concerned about the 
deficit and national debt, you should 
take a good, hard look at Medicare. 
There are changes in the program 
that could be made that would 
save the federal government a lot 
of money. The key to saving money 
with Medicare is to expand it.
According to a recent study 
funded by the Koch brothers, a 
“Medicare for all” system would 
save the American people $2 
trillion over a 10 year period. 
Moreover, a single-payer health 
care system would get rid of the 
greatest national embarrassment 
of all: The fact that people are dying 
in the streets of the richest country 
on Earth due to a lack of ability to 
pay for astronomically expensive 
healthcare.
As for Social Security, to cut this 
program would constitute theft. 
People have been paying into the 
system their whole lives. To take 
what they are rightfully entitled to 
from them would be immoral.
In 
summation, 
the 
latest 
push by the Republicans to gut 
social services has nothing to 
do with wanting to be “fiscally 
responsible.” It is just another 
example of politicians acting as 
slaves to the plutocracy rather 
than standing up for what is right. 
Current government policy has 
been working against working and 
middle-class Americans — and 
things might just get a lot worse.
I urge you to keep all of this in 
mind when you head to the polls 
this November. Every election is a 
fight for the soul of a nation. Fifty-
eight percent of Americans believe 
this country is headed in the wrong 
direction. Let’s do what we can to 
try to turn it around.

FROM THE OPINION EDITORS

What we owe Khashoggi

T

he killing and alleged dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
by Saudi operatives has sent shock waves throughout the media and 
the larger international community. Calls have been made to boycott 
Saudi companies and support U.S. sanctions on Saudi Arabia, but the voice 
that rings clearest throughout the hurricane of emotions and opinions is 
Khashoggi’s own.

It’s easy to feel 
helpless when 
confronted 
with issues of 
international scale


Killing 
off 
a 
television 

character tends to present a 
strange paradox: A character’s 
absence can be so deeply felt 
that it manifests as an unsettling 
ghost-like 
presence. 
This 

is especially true of a show 
like 
“Roseanne”’s 
successor, 

“The Conners,” which has not 
simply lost a character, but the 
character. It’s true. Roseanne 
(Roseanne Barr, “The Roseanne 
Show”) — the dry, divisive, titular 
materfamilias who started it all 
— is dead.

“The 
Conners” 
moves 
on 

without her with grace and, 
of course, the Conner family’s 
signature brand of droll, piercing 
humor. It’s no easy feat: The 

show was tasked with explaining 
a character’s death (we learn it 
was an opioid overdose), giving 
its characters room to grieve and 
still providing humor all within 
a half-hour, Roseanne’s absence 
hanging over the episode like the 
patchwork afghan draped across 
the Conners’ living room couch.

It was a huge gamble for the 

executives at ABC, who bet that 
there might be something left for 

the show to work with following 
Barr’s abrupt firing last May. It 
paid off; turns out there’s a lot left 
for “The Conners” to work with, 
namely some sharp writing and 
excellent performances. Jackie 
(the splendid Laurie Metcalf, 
“Lady Bird”) is coping with 
her sister’s death by frantically 
re-organizing the kitchen; Dan 
(John Goodman, “Argo”), now 
without 
a 
sparring 
partner, 

is roped into helping his gay 
grandson deal with his crushes; 
and Darlene (Sara Gilbert, “The 
Talk”), now the real core of the 
show, is the one left making sure 
everyone’s OK.

Without 
Roseanne 
in 
the 

picture, Metcalf, Goodman and 
Gilbert prove themselves the 
strongest actors on television. 
It quickly becomes apparent 
that it was, in fact, Roseanne 
Barr herself who prevented last 
season’s “Roseanne” reboot from 
really being “Roseanne.”

When 
“Roseanne” 
was 

revived, ABC was quick to 
guard against Barr’s distasteful 
political views by touting the 
show’s new progressive bona 
fides. 
Roseanne 

Conner now had a 
Black 
grandchild 

and another who 
was gender non-
conforming. 
But 

it 
was 
the 
real 

Roseanne, 
and 

not the fictional 
one, who loomed 
over 
the 
reboot. 

How could anyone square those 
characters 
with 
Roseanne 

Barr’s documented racism and 
transphobia? How could a show 
about a regular family star a 
notorious Trump supporter?

Last 
year’s 
“Roseanne” 

promised frank discussions and 
good faith attempts to bridge 
the divide, but ultimately it was 
an empty promise. In the first 
episode of the season, Jackie, 
clad in a “Nasty Woman” T-shirt 

trades barbs with her Trump-
voting sister. Roseanne calls 
Jackie 
a 
snowflake. 
Jackie 

brings Russian salad to dinner. 
Roseanne 
says 
something 

about taking a knee. It wasn’t a 
discussion; it was an assemblage 
of punchlines. And it was an 
enormous disservice to the fact 
that the original “Roseanne” had 
always been intensely political, 
without calling much attention 
to it.

Old “Roseanne” was about a 

family’s improbable resilience 
in the face of life’s anxieties. 
It captured the way families 
really experience politics: not 
through 
reductive 
strawman 

arguments in the kitchen, but 

through struggling 
to pay the bills and 
dealing with the 
IRS and striking at 
the plastics factory. 
That insight was 
on full display in 
the first episode 
of “The Conners,” 
which 
saw 
the 

family 
weather 

through grief and also come to 
terms with the sobering reality 
that the bills have to be paid and 
the trivialities of life go on.

In the episode’s final scene, for 

the first time since Roseanne’s 
death, Dan sleeps in the bed he 
shared with his late wife. He 
tosses and turns, readjusts the 
covers, makes his peace and 
closes his eyes. It’s unfamiliar, 
even strange, but there’s a way 
forward.

WRLD ON DRUGS, the latest 

innocuous 
rap 
collaboration 

album, follows its predecessors: 
interesting in theory, fun on first 
listen but expectedly reductive.

Not since Watch the Throne 

has an album collaboration 
between two major rappers 
resulted in something other than 
the sum of its parts (but that 
album at least takes on a quality 
unique to that collaboration). 
What 
makes 
many 
of 
the 

recent 
collaboration 
albums 

bland is their inability to attain 
this quality. Often there’s the 
sense they’re not even trying, 
that these crossovers exist as 
industry moves rather than as 
organic efforts to coalesce skill 
sets and aim for a gestalt.

Last 
year’s 
collaboration 

albums between Future and 
Young Thug (SUPER SLIMEY), 
21 Savage and Offset (Without 
Warning), 
and 
Quavo 
and 

Travis Scott (HUNCHO JACK, 
Jack Huncho) all evidenced 
this. The artists in that list are 
each dynamic and boundary-
pushing in their own right, so 
it’s strange that these albums 
can be played back to back 
and sound like a relatively 
consistent 
piece 
of 
music. 

What they’re going for on these 
projects is the continuation of 
a sound, owed to Atlanta and 
centered approximately around 
the Quality Control label.

Like 
those 
projects, 

WRLD ON DRUGS aims for 
a commercial middle. Juice 
WRLD, 
of 
up-and-coming 

fame, should add some vitality 
to storied rap giant Future; 
Future’s 
reverence 
in 
the 

Atlanta rap scene should act 
as a sign of confidence to the 

upstart. To give them credit, 
this goal is ostensibly achieved. 
The very existence of this album 
achieves it.

With that box checked, the 

songs feel tacked onto this 
accomplishment. Right from 
opening track “Jet Lag,” Juice 
WRLD takes on a shiny new 
persona as a confident drug 
rapper that renders the sad-
boy aesthetic he rode to fame 
unrecognizable. Future sounds 
great 
as 
always, 
perfectly 

content to ride yet another 
victory 
lap 
around 
in 
his 

Bentley to help out the newbie. 
But Future’s best work is when 
he’s least satisfied, swallowing 
pain down with a cup of codeine 
and dredging up the past with a 
heavy snarl, and just as WRLD’s 
emo tendencies are gone here, 
so are Future’s.

The moments that work best 

are when Future and WRLD 
give each other some distance, 
allowing WRLD to feel more 
comfortable as himself. “Fine 
China” and “Realer N Realer” 
both are standouts. On the 
latter, 
WRLD 
gives 
some 

tongue-in-cheek thoughts about 
money in sing-song: “People 
love to talk about the money 
that they make / Nobody wanna 
talk about the money that they 
save / Who am I to talk about it? 
I blow money every day.” In the 
former, Future’s higher pitched 
flow plays off WRLD’s autotune 

well, and it makes for a track 
that manages to make Atlanta 
rap a little bit funny, à la Lil 
Yachty, while avoiding being, 
well, Lil Yachty.

“Astronauts,” “Red Bentley” 

and “Transformer” all find 
Future taking on the same kind 
of 
approachable, 
consistent 

flow he donned for much of 
SUPER SLIMEY, which makes 
it easier for those along for the 
ride to keep up (though Nicki 
Minaj mostly holds her own 
on “Transformer”). They’re all 
bouncy, bass-heavy tracks that 
fit easily within Future’s more 
recent discography. But it’s not 
clear why WRLD needs to be 
on any of them, and such is the 
problem with many of these 16 
tracks.

It’s strange that the two have 

decided to land at this happy 
commercial brag for so much of 
the album given Juice WRLD’s 
debut last year, Goodbye & Good 
Riddance. It’s an album all 
about pain, filled with cringe-
inducing admissions and riding 
along the dark “emo-rap” style 
recently popularized by Lil 
Uzi Vert. WRLD channels the 
energy just right of the occult 
that Uzi dances with, and it’s 
a big part of what made him 
so palatable to an audience 
increasingly interested in this 
genre 
crossover. 
It 
doesn’t 

make him look dynamic to 
wipe this persona away on this 
collaboration 
— 
nearly 
any 

rapper in 2018 can sound like 
he does here with the right 
producer. Even Usher gave it 
his best shot this week with his 
surprise Zaytoven collaboration 
A. It does the opposite, and we 
come off this album wondering 
if Juice WRLD might not 
be 
wondering, 
like 
we’re 

wondering, exactly who Juice 
WRLD is.

‘Drugs’ is just anonther 
mediocre rapper collab

We should all be so lucky 

as to have a grandmother like 
Laurie Stode. By the beginning 
of the most recent entry in 
the 
“Halloween” 
franchise, 

the 
original 
final 
girl 
has 

grown into a badass bound 
and determined to protect her 
family from Michael Myers, the 
Shatner-masked 
serial 
killer 

who turned her life inside out 
40 years ago, by any means 
necessary. Played, as always, 
by a riveting Jamie Lee Curtis 
(“New Girl”), the same moxie 
that endeared her to audiences 
all those years ago is still there, 
but there’s something broken, 
too – something that Michael 
took from her that she never 
got back. A more focused film 
would see Curtis’s rendering of 
that brokenness and know to 
focus the movie on that, but in 
its quest to replicate as much 
about the original as possible, 
the newest “Halloween” misses 
out on the greatness right in 
front of it.

I’m not going to act like 

there’s no pleasure to watching 
Laurie and Michael go head-to-
head “Clash of the Titans” style. 
When it happens, it’s a sight to 
behold, an edge-of-your-seat, 
knockdown-dragout fight with 
crowd-pleasing moments and 
breathless tension galore. It’s 
unarguably awesome, but you 
have to sit through an hour of 
the plot spinning its wheels and 
director David Gordon Green 
(“Stronger”) running down his 
“Halloween” checklist to get 
there.

So not only is “Halloween” 

about Laurie hunting Michael 
after his escape, it’s about 
Laurie’s granddaughter, Allyson 

(Andi 
Matichak, 
“Evol”) 

running around on Halloween 
night dealing with relationship 
trouble and trying not to get 
murdered. It’s about Allyson’s 
friends, who also try not to get 
murdered but don’t have the 
good fortune of being the direct 
descendant of the first movie’s 
heroine. It’s about a doctor who 
believes Michael is pure evil 
and has developed a strange 
fascination with him, and who 
is explicitly called “the new 
Loomis.” All of these have some 

direct analogue to the first film, 
and while Green’s staging of 
these homage-driven plotlines 
clearly shows his love of the 
original film, homages alone 
aren’t enough to make them 
interesting. They inevitably feel 
like distractions from the main 
event instead of stories and 
characters worth caring about 
all their own.

Even 
the 
cinematography 

cues meant to play on audience 
nostalgia fall flat. The 1978 
“Halloween” famously opens 
with a tracking shot from 
Michael’s 
point-of-view 
that 

follows him as he murders 
his sister. It’s an iconic shot 
for a number of reasons: the 
technical accomplishment of 
it, the innate cheesiness — why 
does Michael turn to watch 
the knife in the middle of the 
stabbing? — the voyeuristic 
thrill, the twist ending that 
the murderer is a six-year-old 
boy, the list goes on. The new 

film shoots much of its action 
in the same way, but here the 
tracking shots feel strangely 
perfunctory. 
They 
lack 
the 

kinetic thrill and immediacy 
offered by the best historical 
uses of the technique, and this is 
coming from someone so prone 
to praising films that include 
tracking shots that it arguably 
constitutes a form of bribery.

What’s more, when the new 

film actually goes off the beaten 
path, it can be a treat. The 
Laurie-Michael storyline should 
have been given far more focus, 
but it’s still engaging thanks 
to the catharsis of watching 
Laurie regain her agency. The 
cinematography 
apart 
from 

the tracking shots, can be 
downright gorgeous at times, 
especially in its use of wide 
shots and inventive available 
lighting. The cast is mostly 
game, with Jibrail Nantambu 
in his big screen debut playing 
what is objectively the best 
character of the year in film.

The nostalgia cues aren’t all 

bad, either, with a kickass new 
score from original director / 
composer John Carpenter, his 
son Cody Carpenter and Daniel 
Davies (“Zoo”) that plays on 
the original but adds a number 
of propulsive new layers. More 
importantly, Green makes the 
wise choice to keep Michael in 
the background for most of the 
first act, his murderous intent 
removed from the forefront of 
the frame but never from the 
forefront of Laurie’s and the 
viewer’s mind. The director’s 
understanding of what works in 
the original film can’t be denied, 
but that all too rarely carries 
over into understanding what 
works in his own film. When it’s 
good, it’s good, but far too often 
it’s a monotonous retread of the 
original’s greatest hits.

Nostalgia can’t carry the 
limp ‘Halloween’ reboot

of movies I intend to frequently 
re-watch. I never took much to 
e-readers or e-books and like 
to read front to back a copy of 
the New Yorker that comes to 
my door every week (thank you, 
Grandpa). Before I joined The 
Daily, I would always pick up a 
copy on my way up my dorm at 
the end of the day. Call me old-
fashioned, but there’s something 
about actually having a physical 
copy of a piece of entertainment 
or work of literature that helps 

me to connect with it. I find that 
screens create a distance between 
us and the material we are trying 
to engage with, or at least they 
do for me. That’s why I’m against 
media socialism. I live in fear of 
the idea that one day, the only 
place I will be able to find new 
music is by paying $10 a month 
to Spotify or, god forbid, giving 
even more money to Apple. So 
join me. Drag that song from 
your iTunes to your iPhone. Pop 
that CD into the player in the car. 

Bust out a cassette tape every 
now and then. You might find 
yourself rediscovering an old 
favorite, or finding new meaning 
a song you’ve heard a thousand 

times. You might also realize you 
haven’t been missing anything 
at all. In that case, no problem, 
I’m sure Spotify will have a few 
suggestions for you.

Spotify. 
Pandora. 
Apple 

Music. What do these things 
have in common? They are 
all music streaming services 
that 
have 
become 
all 
but 

omnipresent 
across 
the 

entertainment landscape. Hulu, 
Netflix, Amazon Prime and the 
forthcoming Disney streaming 
service are gaining an ever 
larger foothold on the way we 
consume media. I try to avoid 
taking part in any of it. Oh sure, 
I mooch off my family’s Netflix 
account and occasionally log 
into my roommate’s HBO Go app 
on my laptop, but when it comes 
to music, for many years now, 
I have done what most of my 
friends are convinced is insane: 
I’ve remained firmly rooted in 
the past.

I have never had a Spotify 

account. 
Ditto 
for 
Pandora 

or Apple Music. When I was 
in 
middle 
school, 
I 
would 

occasionally 
dabble 
with 

Grooveshark, which to the ill-
informed was kind of like a free 
Spotify before Spotify was a 
thing (it was also totally illegal 
and got shut down eventually), 
but I never made the jump to 
the trendier music platforms 
that have come to dominate our 
culture. There’s a very simple 
reason for this, the same one I 
give whenever I am questioned 
on this point by any of my 
understandably 
incredulous 

friends: I don’t believe in media 
socialism.

There’s an analogy I like to 

use whenever I end up on this 
particular soapbox. Imagine a 
world where there aren’t any 

bookstores. The only way you 
can read books is by going to a 
library. Now imagine that public 
libraries don’t exist. The only 
libraries that are around are ones 
privately funded and owned by 
corporations that have become 
increasingly 
stringent 
about 

giving the authors of those books 

the proper cut of the profits from 
their work. These authors have 
no choice but to go along with 
this system because if they don’t 
put their writing out through 
these privately owned libraries, 
then there will be no real way for 
them to get it out at all. That is 
the world that I believe we will 
soon be living in with regards to 
music.

What will I do if, say a decade 

from now, I decide I don’t 
agree with something that the 
Spotify company is doing, or, 
for whatever reason, I no longer 
want to pay for the service and 
decide to leave it? Suddenly, I no 
longer have access to any music 

from the past decade and a half 
of my life, having not purchased 
an album since around 2013. 
I already feel trapped in the 
technological prison of Apple. 
In the past two years, both my 
phone and laptop have broken 
and have required replacement 
and both times I felt forced to 
pay a new Apple product even 
though I felt strongly that I was 
buying what was essentially an 
inferior product to what I had 
before (the lack of ports on the 
new MacBook Pro is especially 
detrimental to a film major’s 
lifestyle). I fear that many of us 
will soon end up in this same 
trap with music.

I 
still 
download 
songs 

(or 
albums 
from 
CDs 
I’ve 

purchased), load them onto my 
iPhone and manually choose 
what playlists and songs to listen 
to whenever I leave class or go 
for a run. Many have called me 
insane. I can only get away with 
this because I don’t listen to a lot 
of modern music, so it’s not like 
I’m constantly having to go out 
and buy the new Travis Scott or 
Kanye West album. Those people 
might be right. But I don’t think 
I’m entirely wrong either. Much 
and more has been written about 
how bad the move to streaming 
is for artists, and while it 
seemingly creates a more diverse 
marketplace, it also minimizes 
the number of outlets that 
new music can be successfully 
distributed through.

I’m a slow adapter. I still 

frequently use my external disc 
drive. I’m not at all opposed to 
purchasing DVDs or Blu-Rays

IAN HARRIS

For a band from Toronto, 

Great Lake Swimmers gives off 
a strong flyover country vibe, 
an initial modesty that quickly 
finds its voice. At The Ark on a 
rainy Friday night, lead singer 
Tony Dekker stood awkwardly 
at the mic, his hands in fists 
and stance unbalanced. Bassist 
Bret Higgins wore abbreviated 
cowboy 
boots 
that 
barely 

reached above his ankles. The 
rest of the ensemble — Kelsey 
McNulty on keyboards and 
Erik Arnesen on guitar and 
banjo — also exuded a midwest 
humbleness in their presence. 
Only 
drummer 
Marshall 

Bureau added a showy, urban 
energy to the stage. However, 
once the band settled in, their 
music pulled the audience 
along for a great ride.

On tour for their new album 

The Waves, The Wake, Great 
Lake Swimmers stepped away 
from 
their 
usual 
acoustic 

guitar-centered sound to a 
more multi-instrumental taste. 
The band often records albums 
in non-studio locations like an 
abandoned grain silo for their 
debut Great Lake Swimmers 
and a 145-year-old church for 
The Waves, The Wake. As a 
result, even with the acoustic 

beauty produced in a venue 
like The Ark, their live set 
has trouble mimicking the 
recording.

Still, Great Lake Swimmers 

found 
a 
way 
to 
fill 
the 

space with the addition of 
McNulty on keyboards. Her 
stripped-down synth patterns 
contrasted the more classic 
folk guitars and bass, bringing 
the band into a new era. 
Although the band could not 
transport a whole woodwind 

section, they were clever in 
how to adjust the set and 
minimize gaps in the music. 
Several songs began with a 
solo instrument then added 
different sounds, crescendoing 
into a massive wave.

Despite their indie status, 

Great 
Lake 
Swimmers 

released 
their 
first 
album 

back in 2003 and have since 
produced a steady stream of 
EPs and records. Reliant on 
the songwriting talents of 
Dekker, Great Lake Swimmers 
has been a constant presence 
in 
the 
Canadian 
folk-rock 

scene, receiving nominations 
for the Polaris Prize and Juno 
Awards. 
While 
tracks 
like 

“The Great Exhale” from New 
Wild Everywhere and “Zero 
in the City” from A Forest of 
Arms follow the traditional 
songwriting 
verse-chorus-

verse-chorus formula, other 
tracks run off on tangents of 
enchanting harmonization or 
instrumental interludes. When 
the band played “In a Certain 
Way,” Arnesen’s banjo riff 
alone could carry the song.

Great Lake Swimmers are a 

hidden gem of folk rock music. 
Although they are based in 
Canada, their soulful rhythm 
guitar 
and 
sincere 
lyrics 

radiate a Midwestern feel, 
making the band right at home 
in the Great Lakes state.

CONCERT REVIEW

NETTWERK

Although they 
are based in 
Canada, their 
soulful rhythm 

guitar and sincere 

lyrics radiate a 
Midwestern feel, 
making the band 
right at home in 
the Great Lakes 

state.

Heists have never felt so 

heartwarming. 

“The Old Man and the Gun” 

provides the mostly-true story 
of Forrest Tucker, a lifelong 
criminal who escapes prison at 
70 and begins a gleeful spree of 
robberies again. He confounds 
nearly everyone he encounters, 
from a woman he falls in love 
with 
(Sissy 
Spacek, 
“The 

Help”) to an amused detective 
(Casey Affleck, “Manchester 
by the Sea”) to dozens of 
nervous bank tellers.

Director David Lowery (“A 

Ghost Story”) outfits the film 
with a nostalgic look and feel. 
The picture is grainy enough 
to feel as if the events not 
only happened in another era, 
but were filmed then too. His 
camerawork is self-indulgently 
goofy at times, with quick 
pans 
and 
zooms, 
invoking 

the absurdity of the story 
at hand, yet his style more 
prominently features extreme 
close-ups of his well-chosen 
cast. The proximity to their 
visages is not claustrophobic; 
it’s endearing and emotionally 
persuasive. 

Perhaps 
these 
shots 

work 
well 
because 
every 

performance in the film is 

genuine 
and 
captivating. 

Even those in the supporting 
cast, including Danny Glover 
(“Sorry to Bother You”) and 
Tom Waits (“Short Cuts”), 
never feel as though they are 
acting. Each line of dialogue 
feels fresh and spontaneous, 

each idiosyncrasy smooth and 
habitual. Above all, the film 
oozes humanity, and that’s why 
its impact is so memorable.

“Old 
Man” 
defies 
the 

abrasive tendencies in its genre 
with admirable indifference. 
It is among the few truly 
“feel good” crime stories, not 
forcing a viewer in with guns 
and violence, but inviting them 
instead with a pair of twinkling 
eyes and an old-timey charm. 

Those twinkling eyes, of 

course, belong to none other 
than Robert Redford, a legend 
made iconic by his role as 
the Sundance Kid. Not only 
does Redford’s dry wit and 

contagious 
grin 
hold 
the 

movie together, but makes it 
believable too. A viewer might 
ask themselves, “Would I really 
hand over money to a man 
who never showed me that he 
had a gun?” And upon seeing 
Redford’s confident charisma, 
the answer is inarguably: Yes. 

A recurring point of humor 

in the movie is the way that 
Tucker 
smiles 
politely 
at 

the people as he robs them, 
making them feel at ease as 
they hand over bags of cash. 
But the expression is as much 
a descriptor of Redford’s witty 
charm as it is the audience’s 
reaction to the robberies — not 
trepidation or urgency, but 
glee.

For 
all 
these 
enjoyable 

moments, the film purviews 
a 
gentle 
appreciation 
and 

not much else. Lowery aims 
for a pure, untainted ode to 
Redford’s 
legendary 
career, 

and 
that’s 
not 
necessarily 

a bad thing. But when the 
narrative momentum picks up, 
the genuflection overrides any 
possibility of tension from the 
audience. 

The truth is, the film wraps 

the viewer up so completely 
within itself that the constant 
encomium does not vastly take 
away from the experience. 
However, it prevents the film 
from having a truly gripping 

Robert Redford charms in 
‘The Old Man and the Gun’

Livers looks for more aggression as sophomore

Coming off an illustrious 
prep career at Kalamazoo 
Central High School, Isaiah 
Livers joined the Michigan 
men’s basketball team last year 
with hype and anticipation 
as one of the program’s top 
recruits.
He then proceeded to make 
himself invisible.
As 
a 
freshman, 
Livers 
did much of the dirty work: 
cleaning 
up 
the 
offensive 
glass, playing solid defense 
and scoring only when needed. 
In 15.1 minutes per game, he 
averaged 3.4 points on 2.9 
shots and recorded a miniscule 
12.9 usage rate — the lowest of 
any Wolverine. He attempted 
just 12 free throws all season.
Granted, with shot creators 
such as Moritz Wagner and 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-
Rahkman around him, Livers 
didn’t 
necessarily 
need 
to be noticed. He was the 
prototypical role player, and 
he filled a role that implied — 
if not demanded — invisibility.
Of course, that’s different 
this year. Wagner, Abdur-
Rahkman 
and 
Duncan 
Robinson play professionally 
now, and much of Michigan’s 
creative punch and outside 
shooting 
will 
have 
to 
be 
replaced. 
Some 
of 
that 
responsibility 
will 
fall 
to 
Livers, but right now, it’s 
unclear just how much.
Livers’ fit on the team is 
still very much a mystery, 
but Wolverine players and 
coaches will tell you it’s no 
mystery what Livers can be. 
At 6-foot-7 and 
235 
pounds, 
Michigan’s 
Gatorade 
Player of the 
Year and Mr. 
Basketball 
in 
2017 
has 
a 
potent 
combination 
of 
size, 
athleticism and 
shooting range 
seemingly 
tailor-made 
for 
coach John Beilein’s offensive 
system.
The process of harnessing 
Livers’ considerable talent, in 
large part, might just involve 
the passage of time and the 
transition from freshman to 
sophomore. Livers admitted 
at Michigan’s media day on 
Monday that he “wasn’t much of 
a talker” last year. But this year, 
players and coaches have both 
noted his improved on-court 
communication, pointing also 
to 
the 
relationship 
Livers 
developed with Robinson.
“He’s a very bright young 
man, very bright in school, 
and he thinks the same way 
defensively,” Beilein said. “He 
sees things around him and 
educates the other guys. That’s 

the biggest thing. He probably 
has more of a sense of a veteran 
than a lot of sophomores would 
have.”
Added assistant coach Luke 
Yaklich: 
“Isaiah 
was 
able 
to sit next to Duncan in the 
film room every single day, 
share a lot of the same drills 
together and a lot of the same 
defensive 
talks 
last year. And 
he saw the value 
of 
Duncan’s 
presence on the 
defensive 
end, 
because of the 
IQ he had, the 
positioning 
he 
had, and then 
the 
personal 
challenge 
that 
Duncan 
took 
every day. Isaiah came in 
and this summer and said, 
‘I’m going to be that talker 
this year, I’m going to be the 
communicator, I’m going to be 
the guy that can guard multiple 
positions.’ And so far he’s done 
a wonderful job doing that.”
Livers bolstered more than 
his communication skills this 
offseason, in which he spent 
both the spring and summer 
semesters 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
along with sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole, his best friend 
on the team. And from Poole’s 
observation, some of Poole’s 
trademark swagger may have 
rubbed off on his roommate.
“He’s been really aggressive. 
We were really trying to get on 
Isaiah last year about taking 
more shots,” Poole said. “... 

He’s extremely athletic and 
he has God-given talent, so 
we just worked out every day 
and we were focusing on being 
confident in your shot, get to 
your spots, start working on 
moving more naturally.”
Poole isn’t the only one 
who’s been impressed with 
Livers’ 
more 
assertive 
mentality. Junior 
center Jon Teske 
mentioned 
that 
Livers dunked on 
him in practice 
on 
Sunday 
— 
no 
small 
feat 
against a 7-foot-1 
behemoth.
Monday’s 
practice 
displayed 
more 
of 
the 
same. 
Livers threw down a handful 
of impressive dunks in open 
play, and towards the end of 
an offensive set, he spun and 
hit a deep, contested three-
pointer. Coming out to guard 
highly-touted freshman Ignas 
Brazdeikis on the perimeter, 
Livers stayed in front of him all 
the way to the rim, where he 
cleanly rejected the Canadian 
slasher’s layup.
“(Yaklich) 
talks 
about 
hunting shots all the time,” 
Livers said. “I wasn’t much of 
a hunter last year. … But this 
year I feel so much different 
because I think the offseason 
really helped, staying here 
in the spring and summer, I 
learned so much about the 
offense. So now I know where 
my shots are and when to hunt 

them.”
Livers is probably never 
going to be Poole. Even with 
the glut of offensive creativity 
that the Wolverines have to 
replace, it’s not necessarily 
imperative that he change his 
game. After all, while he may 
have been invisible last season, 
he was quite solid at doing so.
But 
that 
invisibility, 
coupled 
with 
Livers’ 
potential, 
rendered 
his 
freshman 
season 
inconclusive. 
As 
a 
sophomore, 
though, Livers 
is 
seemingly 
established 
as 
Michigan’s 
starter at the ‘4.’ It’s a role that 
should come with increased 
confidence, responsibility and 
attention.
Will 
Livers 
remain 
the 
capable “glue guy” he was as a 
freshman? Or will he tap into 
his potential as a defensive 
communicator and powerful 
scorer, and emerge as one of the 
Big Ten’s elite power forwards?
It’s not exactly a make-or-
break scenario, but this year, 
the Wolverines should start to 
find out just who they have in 
him.
“Coach B knows what he 
expects 
and 
Isaiah 
knows 
what he expects from himself,” 
Poole said. “He’s locked in, he’s 
a different player than he was 
last year.”

Wolverines draw, 1-1, 
with Michigan State

Chaos.
Wild, 
wild 
football. 
There 
was no order in the game. There 
were no beautiful goal-scoring 
sequences. There was just swinging 
legs, knees, shoulders, hips. Clean 
contact on the ball was something 
you only saw when the ball was 
stationary.
That describes nearly every 
opportunity that came for the 
Michigan men’s soccer team in the 
second half and beyond Tuesday 
night against Michigan State, 
including senior forward Noah 
Kleedtke’s game-tying goal in the 
78th minute. The cross came in 
from sophomore defender Austin 
Swiech, past Spartan goalkeeper 
Jimmy Hague’s outstretched arms, 
bounced on the ground, then off a 
defender and right into the path of 
Kleedtke’s knee.
The goal was an important 
equalizer for the Wolverines (9-4-
2 overall, 3-2-2 Big Ten), as the 
game ended in a 1-1 draw. Michigan 
State (10-2-4, 4-1-2) had scored in 
the 52nd minute with a half-volley 
from Jack Beck that went just past 
the reach of a screened Michigan 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Henry 
Mashburn.
The draw means Michigan is 
currently the fifth seed in the Big 
Ten Tournament, one point behind 
Maryland and Wisconsin. The 
top four seeds host a quarterfinal 
match. There is still hope, though, 
for the Wolverines’ chances to 
host the quarterfinal match: they 
play the Terrapins Sunday in the 
regular season finale. 
“Our guys would love to play 
another home game in front of 
our fans, in front of our families, 
in front of our local crowd,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“We’ll certainly be looking to push 
the game. We won’t go in looking to 
tie, we’re obviously looking to see if 
we can win the next one.”
However, 
Michigan’s 
form 
recently has been subpar. In the 
last five games, the Wolverines are 

1-3-1, their lone win against Detroit 
Mercy. Tuesday, while they showed 
fight, they also showed an inability 
to finish. Nine shots on goal and 
nine corners led to only one goal.
Kleedtke’s 
goal 
was 
the 
standout, in fact. Time and time 
again for Michigan the ball would 
enter the box, and the shot would 
go wide, straight to the goalkeeper, 
or the kick would just miss the ball 
entirely. If the Wolverines could 
have finished those chances, they 
could have won the game cleanly.
“We had many chances in and 
around the six,” Daley said. “We 
were stunned on the sideline 
that we couldn’t get a touch or a 
foot on the ball to steal the game 
completely.”
Instead it was an entertaining, 
chaotic game. A game of two halves 
and two styles.
The first half was organized, 
patient, precise. Especially for 
Michigan.
“We not just dominated out 
wide, but dominated the game in 
many stretches, especially in the 
first half,” Daley said.
The second half, not so much. 
The Spartans got their goal 
early, and as the game went 
on the Wolverines got more 
and more desperate, leading to 
chaotic football where no one 
knew what was going to happen 
next, especially after Michigan’s 
equalizer.
The first overtime was just a 
continuation of the second half. 
Chance after chance for either 
team. If you blinked, you missed 
it. The second overtime, though, 
was a lazy 10 minutes with little 
excitement or chances — they were 
tired.
Still, Daley and Michigan stayed 
upbeat reflecting on the draw.
“I mean from our perspective, 
we’re 
pleased 
with 
the 
performance, disappointed with 
the result,” Daley said. “I think 
we’re a little bit unfortunate not to 
get more out of the game tonight, 
but on the road in the Big Ten, you 
always take point. You put points 
on the board and keep fighting.”

Harbaugh’s last shot at Dantonio
J

im Har-
baugh 
did not 
need to host a 
press confer-
ence on Mon-
day. Only once, 
in fact, had 
the Michigan 
football coach 
done so during 
a bye week. 
That was a 
year ago when a spinal injury to for-
mer Wolverines quarterback Wil-
ton Speight prompted Harbaugh to 
criticize Purdue’s football facilities. 
It was a calculated message intend-
ed to spark reform by the Big Ten 
Conference.
Harbaugh started his weekly 
meeting with reporters on Monday 
with his standard fare: a limited 
update on injuries, compliments 
for his players and goals for the bye 
week — stuff that fills the morning 
sports pages but nothing that makes 
you blink twice.
That was until 19 minutes in, 
when Harbaugh pulled a piece of 
paper out from his back pocket. He 
decided it was time to deliver the 
message he had come to give.
First was his bureaucratic assess-
ment of the Wolverines and Spar-
tans’ pregame fracas. Then came 
his latest cut at Michigan State 
coach Mark Dantonio.
“It’s the opposite of B.S. Coach 
(Dantonio) said it was B.S. That’s 
not B.S., that’s fact. … I’ll go one step 
further and use Coach Dantonio’s 
words from a few years back,” Har-
baugh said, dipping his head down 
to read, “ ‘It’s not a product of a team 
but their program.’ ”
“And that’s using his words.”
Those words mean that college 
football teams are indicative of their 
coaches. And if so, the Michigan-
Michigan State rivalry has hit a new 
level of quarrelsomeness.
Harbaugh and Dantonio have 
a history of tempered ill-will that 
broadened Monday. Last December, 
after the Wolverines were picked 
ahead of the Spartans to participate 
in the Outback Bowl, Dantonio said 
he’d “just continue to concentrate 

on beating Michigan.”
Harbaugh, as he did Monday, 
made sure to counter.
“Saw Coach D comments on con-
tinuing to ‘focus’ on how ‘he’ can 
beat Michigan,” Harbaugh tweeted 
on Dec. 4. “Congrats on turning 
around a 3-9 team, plagued with off 
field issues.”
Dantonio then retorted with his 
infamous response to Mike Hart’s 
2007 “little brother” comments.
“It’s not over, it’ll never be over, 
it’s just getting started,” Dantonio 
tweeted two hours later.
Michigan State used Hart’s 
words as locker room bulletin board 
material for years. It fueled the 
Spartans to eight wins in the series’ 
past 11 meetings.
The lasting images from Satur-
day’s game will only add fuel to the 
fire. Fifth-year senior defensive end 
Chase Winovich repeated Hart’s 
quote verbatim in his FOX post-
game interview. Devin Bush Jr., of 
course, tore up the Michigan State 
logo at midfield after his pregame 
exchange with the Spartan Walk.
“I don’t blame Devin,” Harbaugh 
said when asked about his message 
to the junior linebacker. “I like the 

way our guys handled it.”
Hear that? Jim Harbaugh doesn’t 
mind his players participating in the 
pettiness. He wants them to get into 
it. His note read that teams are a 
product of their programs — and he 
has certainly chosen to battle with 
Dantonio.
It’s no surprise, then, to see the 
two sides continue to go back and 
forth. 
“That’d be like going back and 
saying ‘Oh, look at Devin Bush! 
Look at him out there, he’s out at 
midfield scraping up the logo,’ ” 
Harbaugh continued, pointing 
and working his hands in a dig-
ging motion. “After what just took 
place, I mean, that’s right out of the 
Pistons’ playbook. Do something to 
them, say something to them, elbow 
them, and then when somebody 
else does something back, then 
flop.”
Harbaugh was referring to the 
Bad Boys Era Detroit Pistons, who 
were famous for doing anything 
necessary — trash talk, cheap shots 
and pure disrespect included — to 
get under their opponents’ skin.
Whether Dantonio “orches-
trated” a “stormtrooper” march 

to provoke the Wolverines is up to 
who you ask. That is how Harbaugh 
saw it, but Michigan State released 
a statement Monday night saying it 
followed the planned protocol and 
the tradition had “never” caused 
issues before.
One way or another, Harbaugh 
came to Schembechler Hall with a 
mission: to provoke Dantonio, just 
as he thought the Spartan coach 
had done to him two days earlier.
Eventually, Harbaugh ended 
his spiel and press conference on a 
rosy note, quoting legendary radio 
announcer Bob Ufer before calling 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
the best coach he’d been around.
Mission accomplished.
On Tuesday, however, Dantonio 
refused to answer questions about 
Harbaugh’s comments, seemingly 
ending things for the time being. 
But if the both the rivalry and 
coaches’ history is any indication, 
this won’t be the last spat between 
Jim Harbaugh and Mark Dantonio.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh commented on the pre-game antics between Michigan and Michigan State on Saturday.

With Gary out, Uche stars on defensive line

Eyes and ears were fixated 
as Chase Winovich repeated 
Mike Hart’s “little brother” 
remarks on television after 
topping Michigan State. All of 
the hype, eye-rolls or whatever 
you felt was translated to a 
sustained social media frenzy.
Josh 
Uche’s 
TV 
interview 
followed 
and 
hardly a peep 
was made of it. 
Speaking 
after 
Winovich, 
one 
could 
imagine, 
is a tough act 
to follow. With 
his eyes wide-
open, the junior 
defensive 
end 
was loud and clear.
“All that celebrating, all 
that 
talking 
(the 
Spartans 
were) doing before the game, 
all that just fueled the fire,” 
a fiery Uche shouted into the 
microphone. “We love that, 
man. We love that shit. Excuse 
my language, but this is what 
we do. If you want to talk 
that talk, well, we can walk 
that walk. We just came out 
and dominated like we were 
supposed to.”
Uche rarely, if ever, likes to 
talk about himself — his impact 
is often muffled amongst a star-
studded defensive unit anyway. 
But in the wake of an injury 
with an unknown timeline to 
defensive end Rashan Gary, 
Uche has seamlessly filled his 
absence and shined. His two 
sacks against Michigan State 
upped his season total to five — 
a team high.
Not too shabby for a second-
stringer.
“Yeah, Josh Uche’s playing 
really 
good 
ball,” 
said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
on Monday. “Two big sacks in 
the game. Really coming off 
the edge with speed and power, 
and impacting the games. He’s 
doing a great job.”
It’s difficult to characterize 
Uche’s play as surprising given 
the track record of Don Brown 

defenses. But the ascendance 
of Uche rests squarely on his 
shoulders.
It started with a conversation 
Brown recalled with Uche.
“After the (2017) bowl game, 
we had a discussion because he 
wanted to play more,” Brown 
remembered prior to the 2018 
season opener. “He wanted to 
fight me, I think. He wants to 
play. It’s easy to 
say, ‘Hey coach, 
I want to play. 
Let me play.’ 
Go earn it, how 
about 
that? 
How about go 
earn it? Well, 
he’s earned it. 
I think that’s 
probably fair to 
say.”
Uche’s 
no-nonsense pragmatism has 
become his trademark. It could 
just be a byproduct of being on 
the No. 1-ranked defense in the 
country through eight weeks. 
When asked about what the 
team’s trademark was, Uche 
retorted “You tell me?” like it 
was sacreligious that he was 
being asked to spell it out.
He’s blunt and confident, 
beyond 
overused 
media 

platitudes. What did he have to 
say after a second-half shutout 
and game-ending sack against 
Northwestern?
“We knew they couldn’t 
really hang with us.”
And 
after 
a 
sack 
and 
dominant performance against 
Wisconsin?
“We’ve been a dominant 
defense all year, that’s what 
we do. … If they 
gave up, that’s 
on them, that’s 
a 
personal 
problem on their 
side.”
Beating 
offenses 
into 
submission has 
been 
a 
theme 
of 
Michigan’s 
2018 
defense, 
though, 
and 
Uche has been a spark plug 
for that tendency. He is listed 
at 238 pounds and runs a 4.5 
forty-yard dash according to 
Brown, who also said he “gave 
(strength 
and 
conditioning 
coach) Ben Herbert a kiss on 
the lips for that.”
But his technique has also 
been 
revelatory. 
Scrolling 
through Uche’s Twitter, you 
can find videos he retweeted 

after 
the 
Michigan 
State 
game with hundreds of likes 
that dissects how he swatted 
an 
opposing 
lineman’s 
hands to create a path to the 
quarterback.
If Gary returns this season, 
the defense will have that 
much of an easier time staying 
as the top-ranked defense, with 
Uche maintaining a prominent 
spot 
in 
that 
defensive 
line 
rotation.
He may not 
be a household 
name 
like 
Winovich, 
Gary or junior 
linebacker 
Devin 
Bush 
Jr. 
But 
Uche 
has the same 
intensity, if not 
greater. In that same post-game 
interview, he was asked what 
he felt about Bush’s pre-game 
yelling and field stomping.
“We from the same place, 
I wouldn’t expect anything 
less than that,” Uche said. “I 
would’ve done the same thing.”
And 
he 
stared 
at 
the 
interviewer like he was angry, 
even in the most celebratory 
moment of Michigan’s season.

Michigan sweeps at 
ITA Midwest Regional

There was a lot on the line 
for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
tennis team as it hosted the ITA 
Midwest Regional.
The 
six-day 
tournament 
featured 22 teams, eight top-100 
ranked players and automatic 
berths 
to 
the 
Oracle 
ITA 
National Fall Championships. 
And 
once 
the 
tournament 
wrapped up Tuesday, it was 
clear the Wolverines had the 
most dominant performance. 
In an event where all players 
were 
entered 
individually 
and weren’t affiliated as a 
team, Michigan found its most 
common opponent to be, well, 
Michigan. 
Senior Kate Fahey swept the 
weekend, winning the doubles 
and singles draws. But in order 
to claim the singles crown, 
Fahey had to get past two of her 
own teammates. After breezing 
through her first three rounds 
— outscoring her opponents, 
36-4 — Fahey 
faced her biggest 
challenge of the 
tournament 
in 
the semifinal. 
Surely Fahey 
had 
played 
fellow 
senior 
Brienne 
Minor 
many times in 
practice, but this 
time 
around, 
there was more 
on the line. Either side refused 
to budge in the first set, sending 
it to a tiebreaker. Minor just 
barely took the set, giving her 
the momentum in the second 
set. She was one game away 
from the championship match, 
but Fahey rattled off nine of the 
match’s final 12 games to steal 
the match from Minor.
“I was telling my mom if Bri 
had played one more good game, 
I was out of there,” Fahey said. 
“But she played really, really 
well the whole tournament. 
… It kind of just came down to 
toughing it out, toughing that 
second set out, and the third 
set I played well again. It was 
good.”
But the battle wasn’t over. 
Awaiting Fahey in the finals 
was another teammate, junior 
Chiara Lommer. 
Fahey cruised to an early 5-1 
lead and even as Lommer tried 
to battle back, Fahey took the 
first set, 6-4. The second set 
was much less contested and 
Fahey punched her ticket to the 
National Fall Championships 
with a 6-2 victory. 
“It’s brutal,” Fahey said. “Like 
Chiara and I room together and 

we were studying together last 
night. It’s tough obviously and 
you never want to do it, it feels 
like a practice match. But it 
gets pretty competitive. I mean, 
obviously we both want to win. 
“Obviously, when I played Bri 
and Chiara, there’s both mutual 
respect there.”
While Fahey triumphed in 
the singles draw, that’s not 
the only thing she has to show 
for her weekend. Just days 
before knocking Minor out 
of the singles draw, the duo 
clinched the doubles title and 
earned themselves a spot at 
the fall championships. The 
pair outscored their opponents, 
40-13, over six games. 
The all-senior pairing isn’t 
one fans are used to. While it 
is rare for Minor and Fahey to 
play together, it usually proves 
beneficial for the Wolverines.
“I love playing with Bri,” 
Fahey said. “I love playing with 
everyone, but playing with Bri 
is special, being the same year. 
We’ve been through a lot. … It’s 
just really fun. 
I 
think 
she’s 
one of the only 
people who can 
make me smile 
on 
a 
tennis 
court.”
There seems 
to 
be 
plenty 
for Fahey and 
Michigan 
to 
smile 
about 
after 
the 
tournament they had and it 
has 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 
Bernstein thinking about what 
this means for January and the 
team’s spring season. 
“We have the best teams in 
the region here so it’s exciting 
to see where we are in October,” 
Bernstein said. “I thought it was 
good that we didn’t really have 
to play each other until the very 
end. You know, with so many 
people in it sometimes, they can 
play early and knock each other 
out. 
“I’m proud of the girls, we 
saw a lot of good stuff and to see 
Chiara and Kate playing each 
other in the finals is really good 
for the program.”
Fahey continues to prove 
herself as the frontrunner of this 
Wolverine squad, but there were 
many bright spots coming from 
this weekend. All Michigan 
players won at least one match 
throughout 
the 
tournament 
and four Wolverines made it to 
the quarterfinals of the singles 
draw. Bernstein is excited about 
where her team is at right now, 
but what may be even more 
exciting is where it will be next 
spring.

2020 guard Zeb Jackson 
commits to play at ‘M’

John Beilein picked up his 
first commitment of the 2020 
cycle on Tuesday night.
Zeb Jackson, a four-star 
guard from Maumee, Ohio, 
committed to Michigan over a 
final seven that included Ohio 
State, Michigan State, Butler, 
Purdue, Arizona State and 
Marquette via a video on his 
Twitter.
Jackson, who plays for junior 
guard Zavier Simpson’s father, 
Quincey, with Under Armour 
C2K Elite’s AAU program, has 
developed a close relationship 
with 
the 
Wolverine 
point 
guard.
“Zavier’s like my brother,” 
Jackson said over the phone 
last month, “so we talk a lot.”
Jackson 
never 
officially 
visited Michigan because he 
lives just 45 minutes away, 
making Ann Arbor an easy 
weekend jaunt. In addition to 
Simpson, he also mentioned 
Jordan Poole, Isaiah Livers 
and David DeJulius as players 
with whom he’s close. Jackson 
camped with the Wolverines 
in June, and though he nearly 
announced 
a 
commitment 
to Butler in August, saw his 
profile rise from there. In 
September, after coming to 
watch him work out, Beilein 

extended Michigan’s first offer 
of the 2020 cycle to Jackson.
In addition to location and 
Simpson, there was another 
connection 
working 
in 
Michigan’s 
favor. 
Assistant 
coach 
DeAndre 
Haynes, 
who took a lead in Jackson’s 
recruitment, was on Toledo’s 
staff when the Rockets offered 
him in eighth grade.
“A close relationship with 
the head coach, a place where 
I’ll feel comfortable to play 
my game,” Jackson said when 
asked what he looked for in a 
school. “Life after basketball, 
like, having a coach who can 
teach me how to be more than 
a player, be a man. Go to a 
school where a degree goes a 
long way. And my final goal is 
to go to the NBA. And win, and 
win.”
Jackson, a scorer who can 
make plays off ball-screens, 
fits well in Beilein’s system. 
On a 2020 roster that will have 
lost Zavier Simpson, adding a 
guard was an important step 
as well.
As of now, the Wolverines 
have 
allotted 
12 
of 
13 
scholarships for the 2020-21 
season, as with the 2019-20 
season, and will likely plan for 
departures between now and 
then. Four-star Ethan Morton 
is currently their only other 
offer for the class of 2020.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 24, 2018


I

t was the first chilly night in Ann 
Arbor since term had started. I 
was walking down State Street 

with a friend — the plans of watching 
a movie on the horizon to escape the 
stressful realities of our lives. While 
we were walking, the brisk October air 
at our heels, we noticed a man coming 
toward us. I couldn’t tell you what he 
looked like, and yet this article wouldn’t 
be possible without his gaze.

Face buried in a book, he quickly 

glances up to realize he is on a track to 
collide with us, but he looks back down 
at his book almost as if he hadn’t quite 
rationalized what he saw. He takes a few 
more steps toward us, only to finally 
catch up with what he saw, and looks 
up again, only this time, his mouth is 
gaping open.

He is quickly behind us — my friend 

and I begin to laugh. Sure, we are all 

guilty of staring, but this was almost 
visceral. We spent the next several 
minutes arguing that the gaper was in 
fact gaping at the other one. Giggling 
like high school girls, the uncomfortable 
moment was soon behind us.

I think the first time that I became 

acutely aware of my gender was 
earlier this year. I had flown across 
the Atlantic and spent six weeks of the 
summer in France. It was on the dimly-
lit cobblestone streets of Europe that I 
began to be conscious that I am a woman.

I have always identified as female. 

However, 
the 
actual 
weight 
and 

composition of what it means to be a 
woman, at least for me, wasn’t a daily 
thought. It was a fact as arbitrary as the 
clothes I wear — an afterthought.

This began to change in France. 

There, my gender became an identifier 
that I could never seem to leave the 

house without. It was in France that I 
began to notice the cars slow down as the 
men inside checked me out. My resting 
face was interpreted as an invitation to 
conversation. My polite, “excuse-moi” 

was now an opening. It was as though I 
was plagued by my own gender, unable 
to shake it off. There is a strong notion 
that European countries have won 
critical social battles, leaving the United 
States behind. While several important 
social victories have taken place within 
French borders, there is still significant 
work to be done in regard to gender 
equality. There is a sexism ingrained in 
the very fibers of the culture — it is in 
these nuances that sexism proliferates.

Before leaving for study abroad, 

women are often advised to be alert 
to these cultural differences. These 
small things like catcalling — that at 
times may be deemed negligible — are 
so commonplace that it is difficult to 
eradicate them making the problem of 
gender equality harder to answer.

Yet, despite being aware of these 

potential moments, I was not necessarily 
prepared 
to 
accept 
them. 
I 
still 

shuddered when the older French man 
leaned into me and whispered in my ear, 
“Vous-etes merveilleuse,” or “You are 
magnificent,” as if I were a specimen to 
be admired. I could hear his voice carry 
throughout my body. A whisper in an ear 
is not the worst thing that most women 
experience, but establishing a hierarchy 
of grievances only stands to divide us.

Prior to studying abroad, when I 

would walk in the U.S. — where there 
is still notable gender inequality — I 
would walk like a person whose gender 

is an afterthought — only a part of my 
identity, not the entirety of it. However, 
in France, I felt as though my gender 
was the first thing people noticed. It 
wasn’t always the overt catcalling that 

reminded me that I was a woman, but 
rather always feeling under someone’s 
gaze. At times it was rather unsettling to 
walk to class just to have someone peer 
at me from head to toe.

I don’t think this is a problem 

exclusive to France, nor to the greater 
European Union. Gender equality is 
a battle that has been underway for 
several decades and its successes or 
failures are manifested in various ways 
across the world. France has several 
initiatives in order to combat things like 
catcalling. There are posters everywhere 
on the trains ensuring that harassment 
is prohibited. There are even laws that 
attempt to penalize those who catcall 
women. Such incentives are important 
for moving forward, but they are not an 
end all be all solution.

So as I walked down State Street, the 

gaze brought me back to this struggle 
of being aware of my gender. What I 
believe lay dormant in the U.S. was in 
fact still active. A sensation I thought 
would stay within the confines of study 
abroad managed to permeate to my daily 
life. Maybe a gaping man is innocent, but 
it is not the man itself that is unsettling, 
it is that the gape reduces you to nothing 
more than the exploitation of your 
gender. Your sexuality is taken without 
your consent and objectified. A woman 
walking down the becomes an object for 
admiration, not a person.

Navigating campus gyms: Rules that 

objectify

A

t the University of Michigan, 
sexism is often subtle. It’s 
hidden in plain sight, lodged 

in the school’s culture and traditions 
in ways that are hard to see and even 
harder to address.

One unexpected location of sexism? 

Campus gyms.

Ideally, campus gyms are a space 

for students to unwind from the 
stresses of college life and stay 
physically active. In long Michigan 
winters, snow and freezing weather 
make 
outdoor 
physical 
activity 

nearly impossible. From November 
to March, the three campus gyms 
(North Campus Recreation Building, 
Central Campus Recreation Building 
and the Intramural Sports Building) 
are the only places where students 
can exercise indoors without paying 
membership fees for access to off-
campus gyms, yoga studios or other 
workout spaces.

However, many female University 

students 
feel 
that 
Recreational 

Sports’s 
dress 
code 
policies, 

specifically 
those 
enforced 
in 

exercise settings, treat their bodies 
as dangerous and distracting.

In an online petition to change the 

IM Building’s dress code, Information 
student Ankita Avadhani wrote about 
her 
roommate’s 
experience 
with 

being asked to cover up or change.

“I am absolutely appalled by the 

University of Michigan’s Intramural 
Sports Building,” Avadhani wrote. 
“Today my roommate went to the 
IM building to work out in between 
classes. In the middle of her workout 
she was approached by an employee 
who told her that she was reported by 
someone using the space for wearing 
a sports bra … at the gym.”

The petition, which as of Oct. 20 

had 604 signatures and 48 comments, 
explains that the roommate eventually 
left after being told she needed to 
cover up because she was violating 
the dress code. The Recreational 
Sports’s participant guidelines for 
facilities states, “Members must wear 
appropriate athletic clothing while 
working out and must wear shirts in 
all activity areas except the pool and 
saunas.”

“Yet, when I go to the gym, I 

frequently see men in cut-out shirts 
which fully expose the rib-cage and 
torso side,” Avadhani wrote in the 
online petition. “This has become 
such common form of gym apparel, it 
is now a cliché commonly referred to 

as ‘bro-tanks.’”

“We are not blaming 

the 
IM 
building, 

its 
employees, 
or 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan,” 
Avadhani 

wrote. 
“We 
are 

simply 
asking 
them 

to 
reevaluate 
their 

policies. Their current 
attire policy prioritizes 
the 
discomfort 

members 
have 
with 

women’s bodies over 
the benefits to physical 
and mental health for 
women. This alienates 
women who are seeking 
out a judgement-free 
place to improve their 
overall 
health 
and 

wellbeing. We need to 
change the dress code 
because sexism has no 
place at the University 
of Michigan.”

Numerous 
women 

commented 
on 

Avadhani’s 
Facebook 

post, which included 
an image of what her 
roommate wore at the 
gym, with accounts of 
their own experiences 
with dress code violations 
at campus gyms.

Irregular enforcement of dress 

codes at college gyms is not unique to 
the University of Michigan. In 2017, 
a College of Charleston student was 
asked to cover up and ultimately leave 
the gym for wearing a long sports bra 
and leggings, an outfit which she was 
told did not comply with the gym’s 
dress code. Another student had a 
similar experience at a New York 
University gym last fall.

Both students were told that the 

dress code was meant to ensure that 
the gym remained sanitary.

In 2016, a student at Santa Clara 

University was asked to leave the 
campus gym after being told that 
her crop top could facilitate the 
spread of MRSA (a bacteria-resistant 
infection) and that it also violated 
the university’s Jesuit ideals. A quick 
Google search brings up page after 
page of similar stories.

In private gyms, the issue is 

no 
better 
addressed. 
Women 

are 
frequently 
cat-called 
while 

exercising and subjected to sexual 
comments about their bodies. At 

best, these violations make women 
uncomfortable. At worst, they can 
end in violence and tragedy.

Women’s 
bodies 
are 
especially 

vulnerable 
to 
harassment 
during 

physical activity, and the attitudes 
that permeate campus gyms are 
not unrelated to this vulnerability. 
Unnecessarily gendered dress codes 
don’t keep gyms sanitary, they simply 
create environments where women 
feel as though their bodies are on 
display for others to examine and 
visually dissect. Dress codes that 
target female bodies place the blame 
for harassment and sexualization 
on women. They reinforce the idea 
that men are not to blame for their 
actions, and that women must censor 
themselves to avoid violence.

While the University’s Recreational 

Sports dress code is not overtly 
sexist, the accounts of many female 
students suggest that women may 
be held to it more strictly than men, 
which is simply unfair. Recreational 
Sports 
should 
take 
women’s 

complaints seriously, and they should 
reconsider why, exactly, sports bras 
are considered inappropriate attire. 

I can’t help but wonder if it has 
more to do with the sexualization of 
women’s bodies than concerns about 
cleanliness.

I’ve been to the CCRB, and no one is 

monitoring everyone, ensuring they 
sanitize their machine after using 
it. If Recreational Sports is worried 
about exercise equipment spreading 
illness, that seems like a far more 
productive 
strategy 
than 
trying 

to reduce the amount of exposed, 
sweaty skin.

When so many very big unfair 

things are happening to women in 
America, real rights, respect and 
safety all feel monumentally out of 
reach. While being asked to wear 
an extra layer at the gym may seem 
unimportant 
compared 
to 
more 

extreme forms of discrimination and 
bodily harm, sexist enforcement of 
dress codes is just another example 
of the self-policing women must 
perform in public. By not allowing 
women to exercise in the clothes that 
make them most comfortable, campus 
gyms reproduce the same problematic 
environments that give way to more 
blatant forms of sexism.

“Y

ou’re really cool, man, but 
I’m looking for a straight 
roommate.”

I wasn’t too surprised. The search for 

the perfect freshman year roommate was 
now nearing its fifth month, and this had 
been the third person I had connected 
with that had changed their mind about 
living with me after learning that I was 
gay.

But this one felt different. I thought I 

had checked off all the boxes. We had 
maintained a 20-day Snapchat streak, 
exchanging daily pictures that displayed 
how much fun our senior years were. We 
had talked about rushing a fraternity, 
what we wanted to major in. We both 
even agreed that we would — of course — 
attend every game at the Big House, but 
that our studies were “for sure” equally as 
important.

So when John (whose name is changed 

for privacy reasons) from California told 
me the day before the roommate request 
deadline that he could no longer live with 
me, I felt defective, as if I were a toy with 
compromised packaging. I still worked, 
but my torn label, nonetheless, meant I 
had to be returned.

“I think my roommate just broke up 

with me??” I half-jokingly texted a friend.

I did laugh at first. The process one 

had to go through to find the person you 
will be crammed into a room with for the 
next eight months was pretty strange. 
Yet, with no one prepared to make the 
“brave” sacrifice of willingly living with 
a gay person, the fate of my first dorm 
experience was left in the hands of the 
University of Michigan Office for Student 
Life.

Despite this uncertain start, my 

excitement about moving to campus and 
experiencing the “best four years of my 
life” remained undeterred. It was Ann 
Arbor, after all, and the reality of being 
known as my high school’s “funny gay 
kid” would soon transform to a place 
where I could simply become just one 
among many. And to me, that casual 
existence also meant the ease of finally 
being in a community I could fully call 
my own.

Soon, I thought, I could unreservedly 

be me.
“D

id you hear about 
how Matt has a gay 
roommate?”

“I heard. He needs to switch out ASAP,” 

a look of revulsion hardening his face. 
“I’m not kidding. It’s disgusting. If my son 
became gay, I would legit kill him.”

It was the start of Welcome Week, 

and the naive hope of belonging was 
replaced with a familiar, aching feeling 
of loneliness. With my parents gone, and 
the temperature of my 12x11, un-air-

conditioned 
room 
rising 
with 
the 

arrival of each eager freshman, I found 
myself sinking back into the hole I spent 
years digging myself out of. I came 
to Ann Arbor ready to embrace sides 
of myself that I never truly had the 
opportunity to explore. Now, I could 
finally take advantage of the resources, 
the community and the freedom that I 
had longed for. I had already come out in 
high school, so one of the top ten “Best 
Colleges for LGBTQ Students” was sure 
to only strengthen my confidence with 
my identity.

Yet, as the process of fraternity rush 

evolved and the pressure to find new 
friends mounted, I found myself falling 
back into the same patterns I had 
exhibited most of my life: Talk to girls, 
be as masculine as possible, but most 
importantly, do not let people know that 
you are gay.

“I’m not lying to anyone,” I tried 

convincing myself. “I just am keeping it 
to myself.”

For a while, this worked. Almost too 

well. While I had a few friends from home 
that were aware of my sexuality, in every 
other part of my college life, I simply 
“kept it to myself.” Maybe I thought it 
was a prize, an achievement when people 
came to believe I was straight. The more I 
could do this, I thought, the more friends 
I would have — and the rest I would figure 
out afterward.

But finally, this act began to become 

undone. Walking with five friends I 
had met from my dorm, the subject of 
roommates became the focus of our 
conversation. Recalling the struggle I 
had in finding my own, I remained silent. 
Soon, however, their words brought back 
the dreaded feeling of loneliness that I 
worked so hard to escape. I listened as 
they began to describe their disgust of 
gay people: How they shouldn’t be placed 
in “straight rooms,” how they would 
disown their children if they were to 
“make this choice.” I was then reminded 
of why I came out in the first place and 
the importance of finding my own 
community at the University.

As my time at Michigan unfolded –– 

while speaking with friends, volunteers 
and even strangers –– I became engrossed 
by the distinct sense of commonality 
embedded in the experiences of LGBT 
students. I listened to familiar stories 
of fear, of dejection, of sadness. Stories 
uniquely their own but still bearing 
patterns 
similar 
enough 
to 
thread 

together into one tattered quilt. Even in 
a post-Obergefell v. Hodges world where 
same-sex couples have been guaranteed 
equal standing before the law in America, 
beyond the closet, even on a campus as 
accepting as the University of Michigan, 
gay students suffer an inescapable sense 

of otherness.
“I 

think I was the last guy 
you were with before your 
girlfriend, so like, did I turn 

you gay?”

It’s 8:30 p.m. at Espresso Royale, and 

Information senior Nicole Ackerman-
Greenberg is winding down after what 
she describes as a “pretty light day.” After 
two classes, an hour-long call with her 
peer advisor and a weekly meeting for 
her tech fraternity, she returns to her seat 
across the aging wooden table, gripping 
her drink tightly with both hands.

“Then he proceeded to do us ‘a favor’ by 

offering his ‘assistance if we ever needed 
a third.’”

“It was ridiculous,” she continues. “I 

felt like some foreign object — in need 
of his pity.” Steam from her freshly-
poured coffee obscures her face as the 
fluorescent overhead light illuminates 
her now-focused green eyes. This was 
not the first time people she considered 

herself close with had made comments in 
a similar vein.

“I think that’s what gets me the 

most,” she says, tracing her fingers in 
the indecipherable carvings of the table 
in front of her. “I’m surrounded by all 
these people who say they accept me, yet 
I constantly feel as if I’m not fully there.”

Born and raised in Oakland, Calif., 

Ackerman-Greenberg 
never 
dwelled 

too much on her sexuality. In fact, she 
had found no need to ever “come out.” 
Rather, when she first began dating her 
now girlfriend, she simply broke the news 
to her parents by letting them know she 
would be coming to visit the next week. 
So, when she found herself for the first 
time becoming truly mindful of her 
identity at age 20, the weight she had been 
able to avoid for most of her life began to 
gradually bog her down.

“I felt like I was an object.”
The societal objectification of gay 

A

urora is an invoker. By its 
definition, its implications and 
its pronunciation it invokes 

a sense of grandeur unlike any other 
word in the English language. It is my 
salvation, the conviction of all other 
convictions. It is that word that hangs 
over me during the starry night while I 
lay atop my vehicle in the middle of the 
field with a lover. It is a sweet song that 
plays, creating an ambiance of pure love 
that emanates into a halo around such a 
youthful and romantic desire. It is the 
sweet song playing now, as I write these 
words, driving my pen ever forward 
toward the love of it, whatever it might 
be.

The Aurora is completely pure, and 

is thus the greatest beacon of hope that 
exists. The only thing more pure is that 
which does not exist. It is a cold night. 
Snow is on the ground casting away 
and purifying the unique color palate 
of warmer times. It is cold to the touch 
of a naked body walking onward forever 
in the direction of his or her prophecy. 
There are dark trees in this snowy 
midnight. It is so dark that all that 
can be seen are the straight, defiantly 
vertical trunks.

We must walk toward the Aurora, for 

there is nothing else that can be done. 
Ages pass and misery and happiness 
are merely transferred to new souls, 
the illusion of growth persists always. 

And the notion of freedom is a poisoned 
and lost concept. If true freedom is to 
exist, then we must find the Aurora, 
and we will cry, for its beauty is unlike 
anything we have ever known. So much 
beauty to behold everywhere, if only 
our eyes were free to see it all.

The cold northern gale is a caress 

of the Aurora, it is a reminder to heed 
its call, the call of the wild, the call of 
the north and the call of life. Life as 
never before experienced. Life that 
has but one goal, one central desire, 
and whatever that might be, for it is 
irrelevant and different between each 
individual, it is more important to 
embark upon the journey of awareness 
and enlightenment; that one central 
desire is, for me, represented through 
Aurora. The journey itself very well 
might be the achievement of that, the 
panacea of ignorance, and the endeavor 
that changes forever a life. Getting lost 
to be found is never the goal. The process 
of truly getting lost is an arduous 
undertaking, and the reward of it is not 
getting lost, but being lost. Persisting in 
a state of perpetual lostness, with only 
the Aurora to guide me. That is what I 
principally desire.

A 
simple 
three 
syllable 
word. 

Au-ror-a, and yet I am ruthlessly 
deconstructed 
immediately 
upon 

hearing and experiencing it. It is an aura 
of raw power to be tapped into and used 

to build the newly aware’s confidence. 
The word rolls of the tongue elegantly, 
the syllables are all vowel rich and are a 
pleasure to pronounce, and all three in 
a row creates a sort of light, airy word 
easy to speak. Aurora. Aurora. Aurora.

The Aurora borealis can be seen in 

the northern realms. I have never seen 
them before, and yet I worship them. 
Perhaps I have associated Aurora with 
something more. . . evidently, this must 
be true. A fleeing into the northern 
kingdoms, away from all of the misery 
and lack of love and romance perhaps? 
A pilgrimage, a great northern odyssey 
that we all want to take, though 
the reasons and direction might be 
different. Flee. Flee. Flee as fast as the 
naked body can through the darkness, 
moonlight unveiling the bare tree 
trunks and light snow falling. Falling 
slowly and gracefully like the breath of 
one in the midst of it. It as something 
undefinable, 
an 
inconceivable 
and 

inexplicable answer to an inconceivable 
and inexplicable question.

There is a power that drives life. A 

meaning that must be found. Aurora is 
my meaning, it is both a driving force and 
an end goal that is both attainable and 
unattainable. It is the wind that sways 
the trees and the sunlight that helps 
us wade through the darkness. It is the 
sweet music that is heard, immersive it 
is, and loved while in the region of one’s 

dreams. It is even perhaps the love that 
is so essential to us all. We all must love; 
whether another individual, a place, a 
song, whether it is that journey through 
the midnight snow. Aurora is my it. And 
the midnight snow and bare tree trunks 
are my where; it is, in my soul, that 
particular region that we all have that 
begs for us to explore.

I would walk amongst those lonely 

trees forever in perhaps a vain attempt 
to find that other individual whom 
I can, and would completely, love 
and cherish. And we would love and 
cherish that particular region, and it 
would become the realest of realities. 
I put hope into such a romance, and I 
shall walk through the snow until that 
happens, forever in that sad, northern 
midnight.

And at the brink of eternity, I must 

relinquish the siphon of pure wisdom 
that has been feeding me, and while 
it was personally useful and enjoyed, 
it must unselfishly be shared to those 
who have reached the edge of that life-
altering conviction of all convictions. 
Aurora. 
Infinity. 
Aurora. 
Eternity. 

Aurora. Awareness. Can you feel the 
passion building? Go on in a state of 
ecstatic excitement and anticipation . . 
. it is calling.

“I just got really good at covering up how I 
feel”: Profiles of gay loneliness

BY ALEX KUBIE, CONTRIBUTOR

Aurora

BY CODY LADD, STATEMENT CONTRIBUTOR

ILLUSTRATION BY ELIZABETH STUBBS


people, particularly women, remains 
rampant in our culture. On “Friends,” 
Chandler and Joey jump at the opportunity 
to watch Rachel and Monica share a 
minute-long kiss. In Katy Perry’s debut 
single, “I Kissed a Girl,” she perpetuates 
the notion that relationships between two 
women are just experimental and simply a 
way to entertain straight men.

Ackerman-Greenberg, now speaking 

louder than before, attempting to break 
through the voices of students frantically 
ordering their last caffeine fix before 
moving to the library for the night, begins 
to highlight how these portrayals in pop 
culture have manifested in her own life.

“I was at Skeeps (Scorekeepers Sports 

Grill and Pub), and my girlfriend and I 
kissed for the first time,” she said. “For the 
first time in my life I was kissing a girl that 
I cared about,” a hint of red beginning to 
color her face. “It felt as if there was not 
another person in the world.”

That euphoric feeling did not last 

long, she notes. Soon, that world was 
interrupted by the sight of half a dozen 
men, staring, cheering, as more onlookers 
began to gather around for “their own 
entertainment.” While this brought a 
“feeling of disgust,” what stuck in her 
mind the most was having to weave 
through the crowded bar, watching as 
dozens of straight couples intensely, and 
“sloppily,” made out with one another — 
unnoticed and unbothered.

“I’m sure there are hundreds of bisexual 

girls like me on campus, people who I 
can talk to and who could relate to these 
things,” she said, placing her drink back 
down, the bottom of her cup now visible. 
“I guess I just don’t know where to find 
them.”

Her phone buzzes, interrupting a 

solemn gaze. It’s her girlfriend, asking 
when she will be back home. A smile 
returns to her face.

“I almost feel bad for complaining. You 

know, it could be much worse. My parents 

are so accepting. I have a girlfriend who I 
love. But sometimes — as soon as I begin 
to let go just a bit, something brings me 
crashing back down to reality.”
“I 

came home from school, and I 
knew something was wrong.”

“My parents sat me down and they said, 

‘We heard you’ve been cutting yourself.’”

LSA junior Caleb Grimes met me in 

the middle of the Ross School of Business 
Winter Garden. He stood out amid the 
chaos of networking calls and coffee 
chats transpiring around him, dressed in 
a sweatshirt and the only one without a 
backpack or briefcase.

“Sorry I was late,” he said calmly, “I had 

to come straight here from my friend’s 
house”

Hailing from an all-boys Catholic 

school in Kentucky, Grimes exhibits an 
air that one might expect from an All-
American lacrosse player. At first glance, 
his hardy demeanor supports the cool and 
unaffected presence that he carries. Yet, 
as his guard begins to wane, his effort to 
maintain this composure becomes more 
apparent.

“It was hard,” he says in a more solemn 

tone. “I was just 15 years old. I wasn’t even 
sure what or who I was. So, when I tried 
talking to a friend to maybe get some sort 
of clarity, and it suddenly spread across 
the town, I fell into a dark place.”

During his sophomore year of high 

school, Grimes’s parents received a phone 
call from a friend about his self-harm and 
the rumors of his sexuality. Hoping to 
alleviate their son’s pain and confusion, 
they sought out a therapist to speak with 
him.

“I never got to have my ‘coming out 

moment,’” he says with a more sunken 
face, his hands retreating into the refuge 
of his sweatshirt. “Instead, I woke up each 
day wondering if I would even be alive the 
next morning, all while trying to maintain 
this image of the lacrosse player, of the 
football player, of the student.”

Grimes’s internal conflict with his 

identity is pervasive in LGBT teens across 
the country. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
people who are gay are four times as 
likely to attempt suicide when compared 
to heterosexual youth. The fear of 
discrimination and harassment because 
of one’s sexuality also leads LGBT people 
to have depression and anxiety disorder 
rates three times as high as their straight 
counterparts.

“My therapist helped me sort through 

some of these things, but that constant 
anxiety and overthinking just never went 
away.” He begins to pause at the sound of 
his voice becoming shakier, almost taking 
this as a signal to tuck back these difficult 
memories. “So I clung to anything that I 
thought would make it easier.”

Grimes notes that he wore his “non-

stereotypical” background as a badge of 
honor for the majority of both his high 
school and college careers. “It was funny 
how much I relied on that single label of 
the ‘lacrosse kid’ as a way to lift myself 
up.”

“Half of the reason I wanted to play 

lacrosse in college was because I wanted 
to maintain that safety of, ‘Yeah, I am gay, 
but look at me defying the stereotypes!’” 
he laughs with an almost-regretful tone.

Upon coming to campus, Caleb saw 

Greek life as his next outlet to bolster this 
image. He recalls hoping to not be seen 
as the “gay kid,” but as the “masculine, 
gay frat kid.” While he eventually found 
a supportive community within this 
new space, there are times he still feels 
isolated because of his sexuality. To 
him, Greek life is built upon, in many 
ways, the expectation of going out and 
finding another person to hook up with. 
Reinforced by dark, cramped basement 
parties, where the conversation is limited 
by blaring music, people can mainly just 
“dance and hook up.” While friends may 
come briefly to wave hello, most of them 
quickly disperse as he “obviously doesn’t 
fit what they came there for.”

Even when he has brought another guy 

with him to a party — something he notes 
he is very lucky to be able to do — that 
isolating feeling begins to reemerge.

“I never truly feel comfortable or 

accepted with another guy in public. Even 
the most accepting people cringe deep 
down when they see two guys together.”

When I asked him why he thinks that, 

he responded coldly, “Because we cringe 
too.”

Before heading back to return to his 

friends, Grimes notes how his years hiding 
his identity have manifested throughout 
almost all spheres of his life.

“I just got really good at covering up how 

I feel,” he confessed. “But I go through an 
internal battle every single day.”

This is a common theme for many gay 

people. As discussed in a recent study 
from 
Georgetown 
University, 
LGBT 

people have learned that it is often safer to 
conceal their feelings than to become open 
to criticism or ridicule. This instinctual 
sense of protection, however, leads to 
an undermining of self-esteem and self-
worth. 

“I am grossly insecure with myself and 

I constantly regulate how people might 
view me,” Grimes admits. “And because of 
that, I may have come across in the wrong 
way to some people.”

Now, six years since his talk with his 

parents, he notes he is becoming more 
comfortable with the many facets of 
his identity. His family, too, has been 
celebrating this part of him as well. In 
fact, he tells me, they even went to a Pride 
parade without him.

A smile begins to break, and a warm 

glow fills his eyes.

“Yeah, that was pretty cool.”
B

usiness senior Chandra Sahu 
highlights how being a woman of 
color has played in her experience 

as a queer woman. While it has been easier 
for her to identify other Black students on 
campus, her pursuit of finding other gay 
students was difficult.

“I was surprised by how little of a 

community for gay people there was 
here,” she said in a disappointed tone. 
“Statistically, there have to be a lot more 

people that are not straight, yet there’s 
just no community.”

As president of both the Black Business 

Society and Out for Business, Sahu 
has used the tight-knit community of 
the Business School to find a place for 
minority groups to come together. Yet, 
unlike the University’s Black community, 
which she has been able to find a place 
in, she finds the LGBT community 
remains disjointed. Gay spaces do exist 
in Ann Arbor, including the University’s 
Spectrum Center. However, many queer 
students on campus feel its efforts to 
provide the resources needed to foster 
a connected LGBT community remain 
inadequate — a reality that has tangible 
consequences for its students.

“I am surrounded constantly by so 

many people,” Sahu confessed in a hushed 
tone. “Yet I still feel so alone.”

Music, Theatre & Dance sophomore 

Alix Curnow echoed this sentiment of 
seclusion to me. As the flicker of the 
Michigan Theatre’s sign lit the right side 
of her face, she detailed the struggle she 
has faced in search of a community of her 

own.

“I feel very isolated,” she explained, her 

entire face now drowned in the light. “I 
went through many stages of depression 
and most of it was rooted in trying to find 
where this part of me fit in my life.”

Curnow was ready to immerse herself 

in the progressive Ann Arbor community, 
hoping to find refuge in a place where she 
would not just be tolerated, but embraced. 
However, her time spent trying to fully 
discover her own self became increasingly 
disheartening.

“Friends, even people that are gay, have 

questioned my sexuality — telling me I’m 
just confused.”

“Even though friends try to offer their 

support, it’s lonely,” her shaded eyes now 
fixated on the floor below. “And being 
able to sit down in class and just knowing 
if there were other people like me would 
make things so much easier.”
M

idnight came and the empty 
booths and folded chairs 
signaled it was time to pack 

up. Gripping my empty mug and the 
hastily-scribbled notes from the day, I 

began to head home. The brisk chill that 
waited patiently at the door accompanied 
me on the walk that night.

Passing through the places I had grown 

to know during my time at Michigan, I 
spotted friends and former classmates 
around each mindless turn of the corner.

Maybe I wasn’t so alone, after all.
But with each step closer to home, 

the sidewalks grew barer. Approaching 
the stairs of my apartment building, 
the outlines of two figures under the 
dying street light were etched out of the 
darkness. As the sound of my sneakers 
dragging across the cracked pavement 
below broke the silence of the night, 
the lock of their lips became undone. 
In unison, they jolted their heads in my 
direction, as if they had been caught 
doing something wrong. I could now 
recognize they were both men. Almost 
instinctively, they took two steps back 
from one another. The air now felt colder 
than before.

“How’s it going, man?” one nodded as 

I passed by, as if they were testing my 
reaction to what I had seen.

I approached the door, feeling the 

icy touch of its frigid handle. Memories 
began to flood my mind as that same, 
bitter Michigan chill danced through my 
fingers. My eyes watered, and whether 
the single tear that managed to escape 
was from the gust of wind or the influx of 
memories, I do not know. Yet, as I crawled 
into bed that night, my freshman self took 
a hold of my mind.

The fear that I saw in the faces of 

those two men outside was all too 
familiar. It was the same fear I felt just 
three years earlier, walking through an 
unfamiliar campus with my freshman 
year roommate. That fear of rejection, 
how others may react. Suddenly, that 
insidious, creeping isolation began to 
re-emerge in my mind.

Hoping to clear my thoughts, I peered 

outside my frosted window, but now, 
beneath that same, dying streetlight lay 
nothing but leaf-covered pavement.

the rumors of his sexuality. Hoping to 
alleviate their son’s pain and confusion, 
they sought out a therapist to speak with 
him.

“I never got to have my ‘coming out 

moment,’” he says with a more sunken 
face, his hands retreating into the refuge 
of his sweatshirt. “Instead, I woke up each 
day wondering if I would even be alive the 
next morning, all while trying to maintain 
this image of the lacrosse player, of the 
football player, of the student.”

Grimes’s internal conflict with his 

identity is pervasive in LGBT teens across 
the country. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
people who are gay are four times as 
likely to attempt suicide when compared 
to heterosexual youth. The fear of 
discrimination and harassment because 
of one’s sexuality also leads LGBT people 
to have depression and anxiety disorder 
rates three times as high as their straight 
counterparts.

“My therapist helped me sort through 

some of these things, but that constant 
anxiety and overthinking just never went 
away.” He begins to pause at the sound of 
his voice becoming shakier, almost taking 
this as a signal to tuck back these difficult 
memories. “So I clung to anything that I 
thought would make it easier.”

Grimes notes that he wore his “non-

stereotypical” background as a badge of 
honor for the majority of both his high 
school and college careers. “It was funny 
how much I relied on that single label of 
the ‘lacrosse kid’ as a way to lift myself 
up.”

“Half of the reason I wanted to play 

lacrosse in college was because I wanted 
to maintain that safety of, ‘Yeah, I am gay, 
but look at me defying the stereotypes!’” 
he laughs with an almost-regretful tone.

Upon coming to campus, Caleb saw 

Greek life as his next outlet to bolster this 
image. He recalls hoping to not be seen 
as the “gay kid,” but as the “masculine, 
gay frat kid.” While he eventually found 
a supportive community within this 
new space, there are times he still feels 
isolated because of his sexuality. To 
him, Greek life is built upon, in many 
ways, the expectation of going out and 
finding another person to hook up with. 
Reinforced by dark, cramped basement 
parties, where the conversation is limited 
by blaring music, people can mainly just 
“dance and hook up.” While friends may 
come briefly to wave hello, most of them 
quickly disperse as he “obviously doesn’t 
fit what they came there for.”

Even when he has brought another guy 

with him to a party — something he notes 
he is very lucky to be able to do — that 
isolating feeling begins to reemerge.

“I never truly feel comfortable or 

accepted with another guy in public. Even 
the most accepting people cringe deep 
down when they see two guys together.”

When I asked him why he thinks that, 

he responded coldly, “Because we cringe 
too.”

Before heading back to return to his 

friends, Grimes notes how his years hiding 
his identity have manifested throughout 
almost all spheres of his life.

“I just got really good at covering up how 

I feel,” he confessed. “But I go through an 
internal battle every single day.”

This is a common theme for many gay 

people. As discussed in a recent study 
from 
Georgetown 
University, 
LGBT 

people have learned that it is often safer to 
conceal their feelings than to become open 
to criticism or ridicule. This instinctual 
sense of protection, however, leads to 
an undermining of self-esteem and self-
worth. 

“I am grossly insecure with myself and 

I constantly regulate how people might 
view me,” Grimes admits. “And because of 
that, I may have come across in the wrong 
way to some people.”

Now, six years since his talk with his 

parents, he notes he is becoming more 
comfortable with the many facets of 
his identity. His family, too, has been 
celebrating this part of him as well. In 
fact, he tells me, they even went to a Pride 
parade without him.

A smile begins to break, and a warm 

glow fills his eyes.

“Yeah, that was pretty cool.”
B

usiness senior Chandra Sahu 
highlights how being a woman of 
color has played in her experience 

as a queer woman. While it has been easier 
for her to identify other Black students on 
campus, her pursuit of finding other gay 
students was difficult.

“I was surprised by how little of a 

community for gay people there was 
here,” she said in a disappointed tone. 
“Statistically, there have to be a lot more

people that are not straight, yet there’s 
just no community.”

As president of both the Black Business 

Society and Out for Business, Sahu 
has used the tight-knit community of 
the Business School to find a place for 
minority groups to come together. Yet, 
unlike the University’s Black community, 
which she has been able to find a place 
in, she finds the LGBT community 
remains disjointed. Gay spaces do exist 
in Ann Arbor, including the University’s 
Spectrum Center. However, many queer 
students on campus feel its efforts to 
provide the resources needed to foster 
a connected LGBT community remain 
inadequate — a reality that has tangible 
consequences for its students.

“I am surrounded constantly by so 

many people,” Sahu confessed in a hushed 
tone. “Yet I still feel so alone.”

Music, Theatre & Dance sophomore 

Alix Curnow echoed this sentiment of 
seclusion to me. As the flicker of the 
Michigan Theatre’s sign lit the right side 
of her face, she detailed the struggle she 
has faced in search of a community of her 

own.

“I feel very isolated,” she explained, her 

entire face now drowned in the light. “I 
went through many stages of depression 
and most of it was rooted in trying to find 
where this part of me fit in my life.”

Curnow was ready to immerse herself 

in the progressive Ann Arbor community, 
hoping to find refuge in a place where she 
would not just be tolerated, but embraced. 
However, her time spent trying to fully 
discover her own self became increasingly 
disheartening.

“Friends, even people that are gay, have 

questioned my sexuality — telling me I’m 
just confused.”

“Even though friends try to offer their 

support, it’s lonely,” her shaded eyes now 
fixated on the floor below. “And being 
able to sit down in class and just knowing 
if there were other people like me would 
make things so much easier.”
M

idnight came and the empty 
booths and folded chairs 
signaled it was time to pack 

up. Gripping my empty mug and the 
hastily-scribbled notes from the day, I 

began to head home. The brisk chill that 
waited patiently at the door accompanied 
me on the walk that night.

Passing through the places I had grown 

to know during my time at Michigan, I 
spotted friends and former classmates 
around each mindless turn of the corner.

Maybe I wasn’t so alone, after all.
But with each step closer to home, 

the sidewalks grew barer. Approaching 
the stairs of my apartment building, 
the outlines of two figures under the 
dying street light were etched out of the 
darkness. As the sound of my sneakers 
dragging across the cracked pavement 
below broke the silence of the night, 
the lock of their lips became undone. 
In unison, they jolted their heads in my 
direction, as if they had been caught 
doing something wrong. I could now 
recognize they were both men. Almost 
instinctively, they took two steps back 
from one another. The air now felt colder 
than before.

“How’s it going, man?” one nodded as 

I passed by, as if they were testing my 
reaction to what I had seen.

I approached the door, feeling the 

icy touch of its frigid handle. Memories 
began to flood my mind as that same, 
bitter Michigan chill danced through my 
fingers. My eyes watered, and whether 
the single tear that managed to escape 
was from the gust of wind or the influx of 
memories, I do not know. Yet, as I crawled 
into bed that night, my freshman self took 
a hold of my mind.

The fear that I saw in the faces of 

those two men outside was all too 
familiar. It was the same fear I felt just 
three years earlier, walking through an 
unfamiliar campus with my freshman 
year roommate. That fear of rejection, 
how others may react. Suddenly, that 
insidious, creeping isolation began to 
re-emerge in my mind.

Hoping to clear my thoughts, I peered 

outside my frosted window, but now, 
beneath that same, dying streetlight lay 
nothing but leaf-covered pavement.

There I knew, despite the people I’ve 

come to know and the things I’ve come to 
learn, I could not escape that unshakable 
loneliness.
