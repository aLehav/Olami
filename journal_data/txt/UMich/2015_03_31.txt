CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Open Hillel hosts 
panel on ties to 

Palestinian human 

rights issues

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

A panel of three Jewish civil 

rights activists discussed their 
experiences combatting racism in 

the segregated South with about 
100 members of the University 
community in Weill Hall Monday 
evening. The speakers paralleled 
their activism 50 years ago to cur-
rent activist work centered around 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The event is part of a nation-

wide tour sponsored by Open 
Hillel, a national student group 
advocating for increased inclusiv-
ity of political viewpoints within 
the Hillel International organi-
zation. The event was sponsored 

by Jews Allied for Social Justice, 
Jewish Voice for Peace, the Com-
munity Action and Social Change 
program, 
the 
Organizational 

Studies Program and Open Hillel.

Rackham student Sam Shu-

man, one of the event’s organiz-
ers, said the purpose of the event 
was not to sway views as much as 
it was to open discussion.

“The goal of this panel is not 

to agree with everything that is 
said, but to be open to hearing,” 
Shuman said.

The panelists included Larry 

Rubin, Dorothy Zellner and Ira 
Grupper, who were all members 
of the Student Nonviolent Coor-
dinating Committee in the 1960s.

Rubin said his drive to work 

with the civil rights movement 
in the South stemmed from his 
belief that freedom cannot exist 
until it is experienced by every-
one. He said he did not leave this 
belief behind when he left the 
South, he sees these injustices 

Pollack declines to 
discuss specific OIE 
cases questioned by 

SACUA report

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

After members of the Senate 

Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs raised concerns 
earlier this month with the Uni-
versity’s Office of Institutional 
Equity, University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack addressed the issue 
at the body’s meeting Monday.

A significant portion of the 

meeting focused on the status of 
a SACUA report released earlier 
this month that detailed what 
the committee saw as major 
flaws with OIE’s process. OIE 
is the University unit tasked 
with investigating and resolv-
ing incidents of discrimination 
and discriminatory harassment 
at the University.

The report expressed con-

cerns with the adequacy of due 
process as employed in OIE 
procedures. The report specifi-
cally considered the application 
of OIE procedures in the cases 
of three faculty members who 
submitted complaints about the 
process to SACUA.

“The evidence available to 

us, examined in the course of 
reviewing OIE’s practices, raises 
serious doubts about the valid-
ity of the OIE findings in these 
cases,” the report read. “SACUA 
does not take a position on the 
outcome of these cases. But our 
findings regarding lack of due 
process necessitate reconsidera-
tion of these cases.”

Pollack noted she would not 

discuss the three individual 
cases mentioned in the report, 
but said the University must 
now move forward and think 
about how the process can be 
improved.

During the meeting, she 

discussed

Higher education 
subcommittees 
consider tuition 

caps, funding levels

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan Legislature’s 

House and Senate Sub-Appro-
priation Committees on Higher 
Education each met Thursday 
morning to discuss the budget 
for the 2015-2016 fiscal calendar 
year.

Gov. Rick Snyder (R) delivered 

budget recommendations in mid-
February. While the Senate com-
mittee agreed with the proposed 
budget in full, the House made 
several changes.

The budget is still in the com-

mittee phase and has yet to be 
presented to either full chamber. 
The recommendations of the two 
chamber’s appropriations com-
mittees must be brought before 
the full Senate and House. If the 
full chambers disagree on the 
details, the budget will go before 
a conference committee to work 
out the differences between the 
two versions of the budget.

Dave Murray, Snyder’s deputy 

press secretary, said the final bud-
get is far from finished and there 
remains room for compromise.

The Michigan Daily will be 

exploring Ann Arbor’s most 
quirky, lively, and student popu-
lated neighborhoods during the 
next month to see what makes 
this city tick. Read the first 
installment about the Old Fourth 
Ward and the second installment 
about the Ebel and Yost neigh-
borhoods.

Old West Side

The Old West Side of Ann 

Arbor is a relatively quiet resi-
dential area on the edge of the 
city’s lively downtown restau-

rant, shopping and bar scene.

The neighborhood is bound-

ed by the South Main and Ann 
Arbor railroad tracks to the east; 
Crest, Soule and South Seventh 
streets to the west; West Wash-
ington Street to the north; and 
Pauline Boulevard to the south.

Designated as a historical dis-

trict in 1972, the Old West Side 
offers a collection of homes of 
different styles and ages. Char-
acteristic of the neighborhood 
are one-family homes, many of 
which have front porches that sit 
along tree-lined streets.

According to the National 

Parks Service, a district earns 

historical designation if it “pos-
sesses a significant concentra-
tion, linkage, or continuity of 
sites, buildings, structures, or 
objects united historically or 
aesthetically by plan or physical 
development.”

Barbara Murphy, vice presi-

dent of the Old West Side Asso-
ciation Board — an organization 
that seeks to preserve the histori-
cal integrity of the district — said 
the Old West Side was named a 
National Historic District for its 
iconic streetscape and overall 
atmosphere.

Murphy said that the tree-

lined streets of the Old West 

Side resemble those of American 
neighborhoods circa 1900. She 
also said the neighborhood is 
significant in part because it was 
one of the first neighborhoods 
settled in Ann Arbor around 
1840. Those who lived there were 
predominantly German.

All architectural styles popu-

lar in the United States from 
1860 to 1914 are represented in 
the section’s mansions, located 
mainly on West Liberty and West 
Huron streets, according to the 
OWSA’s website. Home models in 
the neighborhood include Gothic 
cottages, 
Romanesque 
villas, 

Tudor and Colonial homes.

The neighborhood today is 

composed of a mixture of older 
couples, young couples, graduate 
students and University faculty 
members.

“We try to keep some cohesion 

in the neighborhood,” Murphy 
said, citing the Children’s Fes-
tival, Old West Side Garage Sale 
and a Lurie Terrace Concert to 
name a few neighborhood events. 
Lurie Terrace is a senior citizen’s 
home in the Old West Side.

Murphy, who moved to the 

Old West Side neighborhood in 
1964, recalled having several 
elderly German couples or wid-

NAMRATHA SATHISH

Promoting Indian heritage

DAVID SONG/Daily

LSA junior Hank Martin skateboards at Palmer Field 
on Monday.

FLIP IT UP

Engineering junior Namratha 

Sathish is the president of the 
University’s Indian American 
Student Association. Founded in 
1983, the organization promotes 
Indian culture and heritage on 
campus. With more than 600 
members, IASA is one of the Uni-
versity’s largest student organi-
zations.

What is the Indian American 

Student Association?

The 
Indian 
American 

Student 
Association 
was 

formed 
initially 
with 
the 

purpose of giving people of 
Indian origin, who have been 
born and brought up in the U.S., 
a gathering place on campus. So 
what started out as a place to 

gather socially developed into 
this organization that does a lot 
more throughout the year. 

We have five different pillars 

to our org; our main focus is 
always community service and 
giving back. So our biggest 
event of the year is the Gandhi 
Day of Service during which we 
get about 250 volunteers to do 
different service projects in and 
around the Detroit Metro Area.
We also have a huge culture 
show; it’s the largest student-
run 
production 
in 
North 

America. 

With that we’re able to 

involve about 300 people, which 
includes dancers and organizers 
and we have about 4,000 people 
that attend the show every year 
in Hill Auditorium.

What compelled you to 
join the organization?

I came to the University 

of Michigan from California. 
I didn’t know anyone when 
I came here and I knew I 
wanted to get involved in an 
organization or activity that 
was somewhat related to my 
culture. 

I 
didn’t 
have 
a 
lot 
of 

that where I lived; it was a 
community that had a smaller 
proportion of Indians. So I 
joined mostly to make friends 
as well because I didn’t know 
anybody here, but the fact 
that I could also go out of my 
comfort zone with dancing and 
performing definitely seemed 
like a cool idea.

Income inequality increases 
in Washtenaw County

‘U’ researchers 

analyze fluxuation in 
wages and poverty, 
among other factors

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The Huron Valley Central 

Labor 
Council 
released 
a 

report Monday detailing the 
state of economic inequality 
in Washtenaw County, titled 
“Growing Together or Drifting 
Apart.”

Ian Robinson, president of 

the HVCLC, formed a team 
of six University scholars to 
investigate wage fluxuation, 
poverty and income inequality 
in Washtenaw County since 
2005. The group was also asked 
to predict where the trends 
might head in the future.

The 
team 
also 
includes 

Economics 
Prof. 
Thomas 

Weisskopf, 
Sociology 
Prof. 

Howard Kimeldorf, Statistics 
Prof. David Reynolds, assistant 
research scientist Roland Zullo 
and Rackham student Denise 
Bailey.

The investigation found that 

income inequality is on the 
rise and, after accounting for 
inflation, that more than half 
of the county’s residents have 
seen their pay decline.

The report also stated that 

one-third of workers and one-
quarter of households in the 
county did not earn enough in 
2013 to satisfy basic needs as 
specified in a 2014 report from 
United Way.

The Asset Limited, Income 

Restrained, 
Employment 

report report assesses financial 
hardship 
in 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan, with the goal of 
identifying “the extent of the 
economic challenges” faced by 
the state’s residents.

In addition, the committee 

found that nine out of 10 of 
the fastest-growing jobs pay 
too little to meet the ALICE 
report’s 
definition 
of 
basic 

needs.

“I think what it says is that by 

itself the economic marketplace 
is not going to deliver broadly 
shared family supporting jobs,” 
Reynolds said. “Yes, the good 
news is there are jobs out there 
and they are going to continue 
to come, but it’s going to take 
concrete 
intervention 
and 

planning to make those jobs 
family-supporting.”

The report said the trends 

found in Washtenaw County 
are occurring in many other 
communities in the country, 
and have been growing since 
the mid-1970s.

Ultimately, 
the 
report 

recommends 
the 
creation 

of a task force composed of 
community 
organization 

leaders, 
organized 
labor, 

businessmen 
and 
women, 

elected officials and social 
science researchers.

Reynolds said the task force 

will investigate how other local 
governments have combated 
similar issues and then propose 
initiatives 
to 
reverse 
the 

current trends.

“Leaders will really kind of 

investigate what have other 
localities done at the municipal 
and county level that seems to 
have worked and is relevant to 
Washtenaw County and make 
some recommendations of what 
are some concrete things that 
we can do locally to kind of 
build for this shared future,” 
Reynolds said.

The task force, which has 

already been created, includes 
Paul Saginaw, co-founder and 
co-owner 
of 
Zingerman’s, 

Chuck Warpehoski, a member 
of the Ann Arbor City Council 
and State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–
Ann Arbor), among others.

Councilmember Jane Lumm listens to a presentation on the budget for the City of Ann Arbor at Larcom City Hall Monday.
Councilmembers discuss 
2016-2017 budget options

As possible deficit 

looms, work sessions 
continue before vote

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

If the city continues existing 

operations through the 2017 
fiscal year, Ann Arbor will 
experience a $72,262 budget 
deficit, according to a budget 
work session Monday night.

Craig Hupy, the Ann Arbor 

public services administrator, 
presented a review of the city’s 
water, sewer, solid waste and 
storm water funds.

Hupy 
also 
reviewed 
the 

progress 
of 
the 
Residuals 

Handling Improvements Project, 
Facilities Renovations Project, 
the tree removal and pruning 
project and fleet services.

Budget projections

Tom Crawford, the city’s chief 

financial officer, presented a plan 
for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, 
providing an overview of the 

city’s General Fund and Street 
Millage Fund, among others.

Crawford’s 
presentation 

showed fiscal year 2017 revenues 
of the city anticipated to total 
$98,887,473, while the city’s 
expenditures 
are 
projected 

to reach $98,959,735, leaving 
$72,262 in deficit.

Water Fund

Other topics of concern involved 

the review and projections of the 
city’s Water Fund.

Hupy said cities are using less 

water nationally, and noted Ann 
Arbor is no exception.

“That is a national trend,” 

Hupy said. “... As the message 
about water conservation is sent 
out across the whole nation it’s 
having an impact not only in the 
west … it’s also affecting those of 
us east of the Mississippi.”

As a result, water bills in Ann 

Arbor are increasing to make up 
for the loss in sales.

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1) expressed concern 
over this issue.

“Everything that I get from 

the 
city 
encourages 
me 
to 

conserve and use less and I’m 
ready for that, but the incentive is 
being taken away when you raise 
my prices,” Briere said.

Hupy said the issue is not 

just a local one but a concern for 
the national water and sewer 
industry.

Recycling costs

Another 
issue 
discussed 

by council members was the 
widening gap between cost and 
revenue numbers concerning the 
city’s solid waste management, 
specifically recycling.

The city currently levies a tax 

to provide funds for solid waste 
management. After recyclable 
goods are collected, certain items 
can be sold for revenue. Hupy’s 
presentation 
examined 
how 

the cost of the recycling service 
is 
increasing 
and 
exceeding 

revenue generated by the process 
as taxes and revenue remain 
stable.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) asked 
Hupy why the cost of recycling 
services is increasing.

SANAA, Yemen 
Saudi naval forces 
strike Yemen rebels

Saudi-led naval forces imposed 

a blockade on Yemen’s ports as 
coalition airstrikes on Monday 
repelled an advance on the south-
ern port city of Aden by Shiite 
rebels and forces loyal to a former 
president, in what appeared to be 
the most intense day of fighting 
since the air campaign began five 
days ago.

The move to block ports 

appeared aimed at preventing the 
rebels, known as Houthis, from 
rearming, and comes after the 
coalition achieved full control of 
the skies and bombed a number 
of rebel-held airports. The rebels 
are supported by Iran, but both 
Iran and the Houthis deny Teh-
ran has armed them.

As night fell, intense explo-

sions could be heard through-
out the rebel-held capital Sanaa, 
where warplanes had carried out 
strikes since the early morning. 
Military officials from both sides 
of the conflict said that airstrikes 
were targeting areas east and 
south of the third largest city of 
Taiz, as well as its airport, while 
naval artillery and airstrikes hit 
coastal areas east of Aden.

Daily wire reports 

ows as neighbors — remnants of 
the neighborhood’s heritage — 
most of which are now gone.

However, Murphy says there 

is still a lingering German influ-
ence by way of names in the 
neighborhood, as seen in the 
name of the local Bach Elemen-
tary School, and the fact that sev-
eral existing buildings in the Old 
West Side were once breweries.

Jim Smith, co-owner of the 

Washtenaw Dairy, a working ice 
cream parlor and donut shop of the 
Old West Side since 1934, said the 
dairy once pasteurized, homog-
enized and bottled milk for resi-
dents to pick up on a daily basis.

Washtenaw Dairy now deliv-

ers all different products includ-
ing cheese, milk, ice cream and 
doughnuts. The dairy provides 
several Ann Arbor coffee shops 
with milk, including Espresso 
Royale, Sweetwaters and occa-
sionally Starbucks.

“This is a great family neigh-

borhood,” Smith said. “People 
walk their dogs around here, and 
on a nice summer night they all 
come down to the dairy.”

Jay Platt, owner of the West 

Side Book Shop, opened his 
store in 1975.

The shop building was previ-

ously owned by a German family 
who ran a photography studio in 
the 19th century then converted 
the store to a children’s book-

shop, selling German books.

“It’s an old and established 

neighborhood,” Platt said. “There 
are a lot of businesses that have 
been here a long time.”

Germantown

German families once heav-

ily populated Ann Arbor’s “Ger-
mantown” neighborhood as well. 
Today, its borders are defined by 
East William Street to the north, 
Main Street to the west, South 
Division Street to the east and 
East Madison Street to the south.

In 2010, Germantown was 

voted as not qualifying for a His-
toric District status by Ann Arbor 
City Council, paving the way for 
developer Alex de Parry to tear 
down seven historic homes as 
part of his City Place apartment 
project on South Fifth Avenue.

One remaining historic struc-

ture is the stone castle-like Beth-
lehem Church on South Fourth 
Avenue, which was named a 
historic site in 1982 by the state 
of Michigan. According to state 
records, the church was Ann 
Arbor’s first German congrega-
tion, originally serving German 
families who settled in the area 
in the 1820s and 30s.

However, Murphy said the Ger-

mantown designation represents a 
historical moment, less than a cur-
rently designated community.

“Nobody uses the term Ger-

mantown anymore and they 
haven’t in all the time I’ve lived 
here,” she said. “Germantown is 
a historical place.”

of the sides come together and 
we look at what each side wants 
to do,” Murray said. “We look 
forward to thoughtful, good 
discussions with our partners 
within coming weeks to build a 
budget.”

Murray said the budget pro-

cess will hopefully conclude by 
June, which is one of the gover-
nor’s goals for this year.

Under 
Snyder’s 
proposal 

approved by the Senate, the 
University’s funding increases 
would align with the rate of 
inflation and receive a 1.9 per-
cent increase. However, the 
House passed just half of that 
proposed budget and under 
their version, the University 
would receive a 0.9 percent 
funding increase.

Rep. Mike McCready (R–

West Bloomfield), head of 
the 
House 
Appropriations 

Subcommittee 
on 
Higher 

Education, said the 1 percent 
increase instead of a 2 per-
cent increase was directed to 
the subcommittee by Rep. Al 
Pscholka (R–Benton Harbor), 

the chair of the appropriations 
committee.

“We are assigned targets by 

the chairman of our appropria-
tions committee,” McCready 
said. 
“Our 
appropriations 

chairman assigned us a target 
of 1 percent versus the 2 per-
cent. I don’t know the reason 
that they have, but sometimes 
they’re negotiating all of the 
different budgets, and so they 
may reduce in one area tempo-
rarily to try and get changes in 
another area.”

Pscholka was unavailable to 

comment on Monday.

McCready said the appro-

priations committee has yet to 
present the proposal to the full 
House and the details are liable 
to change.

“There’s still a probabil-

ity that it’s going to be a 2 per-
cent 
increase 
because 
the 

Senate and the executive are 
asking for a 2 percent increase,” 
McCready said. “We’re going to 
see how that plays out.”

Complying with the gov-

ernor’s recommendation, the 
Senate agreed to a 2.8 percent 
restraint on tuition fee increas-
es, and the House recommend-
ed a higher tuition restraint 

of 4 percent or an increase of 
$400 per student depending on 
which one was greater.

“Originally I had asked to 

remove the tuition cap and let 
the market make the correc-
tions,” McCready said. “We 
are negotiating on that cap, 
and my recommendation is to 
go with a 4 percent or $400 
tuition cap restraint, which-
ever was higher, for schools to 
work with to give them a little 
bit of room.”

In testimony before the leg-

islature in February, University 
President Mark Schlissel said 
the University would appreci-
ate a higher tuition cap.

“We are all committed to 

try to keep tuition as modest as 
possible to promote accessibil-
ity to public higher education,” 
Schlissel said in an interview 
with The Detroit News. “And 
it’s a balancing (act) to maintain 
accessibility to quality higher 
education. We want to have the 
best faculty and the best facili-
ties. ... Having the flexibility 
beyond what the governor pro-
posed would be welcomed, but 
we’re not sure yet whether it’s 
essential to us.”

still occurring throughout the 
United States and abroad.

“Jewish people will not be 

safe until all peoples are safe,” 
Rubin said.

Each of the speakers spoke 

on the importance of coalitions 
and 
overcoming 
barriers. 

Many speakers said while it 
was important for people to 
overcome discrimination based 
on race to make progress in the 
1960s, today it is important to 
overcome religious differences 
in 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 

conflict.

Grupper said he found that 

he had more in common with 
people of different upbringings 
and beliefs at times than those 
of his own when it came to 
viewpoints on civil rights.

“Culture and religion are 

reflections 
of 
a 
historical 

moment: that there are those 
who 
accommodate, 
and 

those who resist,” Grupper 
said. “I went to a Holocaust 
commemoration at the Jewish 
community center in Louisville 
a few decades ago. The speaker 
said the lesson of the Holocaust 
was that Jews could only trust 
Jews. I was sitting next to a 
woman whose father, a non-

Jew, had landed in Normandy 
during the World War II the day 
the ship, the Susan B. Anthony 
was sunk by the German navy, 
and I knew I had more in 
common with this woman’s 
father, a gentile, than the Jew 
speaking.”

Rubin said he was appalled 

by the economic inequality 
he witnessed during his visit 
to the West Bank last year. He 
paralleled the racial oppression 
in the South during the 1960s 
to what he saw as religious 
oppression in West Bank today.

He said one of the most 

shocking 
scenes 
from 
his 

trip was when he visited 
Bethlehem and saw the 26-foot-
high guarded wall that is 
topped with barbed wire and 
surrounds the city. Zellner said 
she sobbed for hours when she 
saw the daunting wall with the 
Israeli flag on it, and compared 
the wall around Bethlehem 
to the walls of concentration 
camps during the Holocaust.

“If you say, like some students 

said to me the other day, ‘Oh, 
you’re evoking the Holocaust,’ 
that’s what one of them said 
to us, and whether it’s unfair 
or not, I am, because I am of 
that age,” Zellner said. “I do 
have that kind of context, and 
most Jewish people have that 
kind of context, and we should 

have that kind of context; it did 
happen to us.”

Zellner’s 
portion 
of 
the 

lecture emphasized how the 
Jewish community has a long 
standing 
history 
of 
social 

activism, which she believes 
is not talked about enough. 
Zellner said she left her civil 
rights work in the South with 
the lingering feeling that there 
was something else that she had 
not completed, but found it in 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
after hearing an Israeli-leftist 
talk. She visited the West Bank 
the following year.

“As civil rights workers we 

have the nerve to talk about the 
people of Palestine,” Zellner 
said. 
“We 
learned 
it 
was 

important to stand up then, 
and, guess what, we think it’s 
important to stand up now.”

Both Rubin and Zellner said 

they noticed in the last five 
years a resurgence in social 
activism compared to the lull 
that they noted in the previous 
30 years.

“The past five years, there 

has been a real explosion of 
collective 
action 
amongst 

students,” Rubin said. “I think 
the students today are more 
knowledgeable, strategic and 
more disciplined than we ever 
were.”

and emphasized the importance 
of allowing for flexibility in the 
process.

“While I think there are a lot 

of ways to improve due process, 
we can’t have a rigid, one-size-
fits-all procedure,” she said.

Pollack said she hopes to 

release material in May that 

will clarify how the grievance 
hearing board will specifically 
address cases. She added that 
said she wishes to reconvene 
with SACUA on the issue by the 
end of the summer.

However, the initial SACUA 

report recommended that the 
verdicts in the cases in question 
be reversed until they could 
be “reconsidered in a forum 
with appropriate due process 
protections.”

Scott 
Masten,

“I know on the report we

remains a huge disappointment. 
It bothers me immensely as an 
institution that we can’t find a

INDIANAPOLIS 
(AP) 
— 

Gov. Mike Pence called off 
public appearances Monday 
and sports officials planned an 
“Indy Welcomes All” campaign 
ahead of this weekend’s NCAA 
Final Four in Indianapolis as 
lawmakers scrambled to quiet 
the firestorm over a new law 
that has much of the country 
portraying Indiana as a state of 
intolerance.

Republican 
legislative 

leaders said they are working 
on adding language to the 
religious-objections 
law 
to 

make it clear that the measure 
does not allow discrimination 
against gays and lesbians. As 
signed by Pence last week, the 
measure prohibits state laws 
that 
“substantially 
burden” 

a person’s ability to follow 
his or her religious beliefs. 
The definition of “person” 
includes religious institutions, 
businesses and associations.

“What we had hoped for 

with the bill was a message 
of inclusion, inclusion of all 
religious beliefs,” Republican 
House Speaker Brian Bosma 
said. “What instead has come 
out is a message of exclusion, 
and that was not the intent.”

The efforts fell flat with 

Democrats, who called for 
a 
repeal, 
and 
even 
some 

Republicans.

“They’re scrambling to put 

a good face on a bad issue. 
What puzzles me is how this 
effort came to the top of the 
legislative agenda when clearly 
the 
business 
community 

doesn’t support it,” said Bill 
Oesterle, an aide to Republican 
former Gov. Mitch Daniels and 
CEO of consumer reporting 
agency Angie’s List, which 
canceled expansion plans in 
Indianapolis because of the 
law.

Indianapolis Mayor Greg 

Ballard, a Republican, said the 
law threatens to undermine 
the city’s economic growth 
and reputation as a convention 
and 
tourism 
destination 

and called for lawmakers to 
add protections for sexual 
orientation and gender identity 
to Indiana civil-rights laws.

“I call upon Governor Pence 

and the Indiana Legislature to 
fix this law. Either repeal it or 
pass a law that protects all who 
live, work and visit Indiana. 
And 
do 
so 
immediately. 

Indianapolis 
will 
not 
be 

defined by this,” Ballard said.

After a two-hour private 

meeting of House Republicans, 
Bosma 
said 
Monday 
that 

repealing the law isn’t “a 
realistic goal at this point.”

“I’m looking for a surgical 

solution, and I think the least 
intrusive surgery is to clarify 
that (the law) cannot be used 
to support the denial of goods, 
facilities or services to any 
member of the public,” he said.

Pence, who defended the law 

during a television appearance 
Sunday, canceled scheduled 
appearances 
Monday 
night 

and Tuesday, in part because of 
planned protests.

In an essay for The Wall 

Street Journal, Pence said 
“the law is not a ‘license to 
discriminate’” 
and 
reflects 

federal law. But the Affordable 
Care Act, he said, “renewed 
concerns about government 
infringement on deeply held 
religious beliefs.”

“Faith 
and 
religion 
are 

important values to millions 
of 
Indiana 
residents,” 
he 

said. “With the passage of 
this legislation, Indiana will 
continue to be a place that 
respects the beliefs of every 
person in our state.”

W

hen I started college 
last year, I averaged 
about five hours of sleep 

a night. As the 
year 
progressed, 

my alarm clock 
chirped an hour 
earlier. Four hours 
of sleep definitely 
wasn’t something 
I 
enjoyed, 
but 

it was a routine 
necessity, just like 
everything 
else 

on my to-do list. 
I enlisted it as 
another 
adjust-

ment made toward “maturing.” Col-
lege meant being career-driven with 
lofty ambitions for success among a 
competitive pool of peers — so natu-
rally, sleep-deprived, right?

Unfortunately, after a few months, 

the human body realizes it cannot 
physically operate with so little rest. 
No phone can go without a recharge. 
No road trip can happen without a 
pit stop, and inconveniently, the body 
will eventually demand sleep or oth-
erwise shut down.

This year, I remember setting an 

alarm for an 8 p.m. power nap, then 
awaking disoriented at 7 a.m. the 
next morning. My roommate and I 
consistently sleep through both our 
alarms, leaving us frantic and hur-
ried in the mornings before class. 
The problem is, I’m certain I’m not 
the only one with these experiences. 
One peek into any library on any day 
indicates the sheer abundance of 
students working from the moment 
they wake up until the time they fall 
asleep on top of their books.

Time has become most college 

students’ most valuable possession. 
Personally, I feel the need to take 
advantage of all the University offers 
while I’m already paying upwards of 
$50,000 each year. However, what 
started as getting the most “bang 
for my buck,” transpired into a per-
sonal desire, a competitive urge to 
do everything — to stay in good aca-
demic standing, to have a job, to learn 
money management, to maintain a 
social life, to lead extracurricular 
clubs and more and more.

According to a recent Michigan 

Daily survey, 63 percent of students 
participate in clubs at least once a 
week. Instead of striving to balance 
our busy lives with good health, we 
have instead redefined “balance” to 
mean all-inclusive involvement. Col-
lege has turned us into workaholics.

Essentially, we forgo sleep com-

pletely or prioritize it at the bottom 
of our lists, viewing it as more of a 
hindrance to productivity rather 
than a human necessity. We tell our-
selves to “suck it up” when we feel 
burnout approaching to suppress and 
endure onwards. What doesn’t kill 
you makes you stronger, right?

In class, our professors point out 

how we all look exhausted with 
droopy eyelids in the middle of the 
day, berating us to sleep at least 
eight hours a day. Unfortunately, we 
have heard this suggestion time and 
time again. Yet we’re never galva-
nized to change our lifestyle, even 
when we’ve experienced some of the 
malignant consequences.

As a result, many students resort 

to 
caffeine-dependent 
lifestyles 

fueled by coffee, soda, energy drinks 
and even attention-enhancing drugs. 
Adderall and Ritalin are two of the 
most common drugs sold on the 
college “black market,” used most 
commonly for academic rather than 
recreational purposes. When I sur-
veyed a psychology discussion, 90 
percent of the class raised their hand, 
admitting they knew at least one per-
son who bought those drugs without 
a prescription to more effectively 
complete their work.

Last spring, the University’s Cen-

tral Student Government introduced 
a pilot phase of napping stations at 
the Undergraduate Library because 
96 percent of 500 survey respondents 
felt fatigue was disrupting their per-
formance. In addition to this, there 
have been few initiatives to actively 
decrease or temporarily ameliorate 
sleep deprivation, and only a string 
of elusive online tips to improve sleep 
quality. Daily columnist Jenny Wang 
also wrote about a burn-out the week 
before spring break, where she hum-
bly asked professors for reasonably 
manageable academic loads.

However, the crux of the issue 

is not solely from schoolwork, like 
the CSG initiative and Wang’s arti-
cle may suggest. Naps and lighter 
coursework cannot remedy the situ-
ation long-term. Rather, our sleep 
deprivation stems from our academ-
ic objectives paired with the work 
outside of class that we voluntarily 
take on (and persuade ourselves we 
need for a complete college experi-
ence). Deprioritizing sleep has been 
increasingly cultivated and perpetu-
ated by our scholarly, success-hungry 
society so that the workaholic atti-
tude is no longer simply a cultural 

factor, but now inherent within our-
selves. Sleep deprivation is more a 
product of our mentalities.

We have already read the correla-

tive studies and heard the statistics 
time and time again detailing the 
relationship between sleep, memory 
processing and academic perfor-
mance. We also don’t need to know 
that 73 percent of college students 
have sleep issues; we already know 
that it’s some astoundingly high 
number, so the specifics that almost 
three-fourths of this campus feels 
exhausted during the day isn’t a 
shocker.

Additionally, just 11 percent report 

good sleep — far too small a fraction 
especially since we know how closely 
sleep is related to academic perfor-
mance. More specifically, accord-
ing to Shelley Hershner and Ronald 
Chervin’s study relating college stu-
dents to sleep, rising just one hour 
earlier decreases student GPAs by an 
average of 0.132 out of 4.0 points.

You don’t need me to rattle off all 

the pernicious consequences, like your 
teachers and parents have done too 
many times before, but it’s clear that 
we are only shooting ourselves at our 
shoes. At our age, we have surpassed 
ignorance. Yet, we ironically continue 
to deprive ourselves of the necessity of 
sleep. Our motivation for consistently 
harming our bodies in this way can 
only be attributed to our rigid men-
talities, programmed by the anxiety of 
ambition or the fear of inadequacy.

Each year, countless scientific 

and psychological studies are con-
ducted about sleep deprivation, only 
strengthening the same conclu-
sions citing its degree of detriment. 
Regardless of the statistics from 
research, advice from University 
Health Services and pleas from 
professors to better “balance” our 
schedules and get more rest, our 
mentalities are not so simply altered. 
Old habits die hard, or not at all.

From an evolutionary standpoint, 

will we, as humans, gradually require 
less sleep in the future? Will we drive 
ourselves to work all the time that 
we’ll physically require less rest to 
refuel? As we have seen, we turn a 
blind eye or a helpless shrug regard-
less of our education and awareness 
about the subject. So, as a collective, 
competitive culture and individually 
as insatiable students, what will it 
take to change our minds?

To be Malcolm X

Political dissent is a fascinating concept. 

To me, the act of politically dissenting — from 
popular opinion, from one’s own communally 
associated belief or from previously held per-
sonal ideology — is a courageous act of defiance.

Last March, Students Allied for Freedom 

and Equality brought forth a resolution to Cen-
tral Student Government that requested the 
creation of a committee to investigate compa-
nies that the University invests in that violate 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and profit off of Israel’s occupation of Gaza and 
the West Bank. I was a representative on the 
assembly at the time, as well as a candidate for 
student body president. Prior to the proposal of 
this resolution, I didn’t know much about the 
international Boycott, Divestment and Sanc-
tions (BDS) movement, and I had never formal-
ly engaged in any advocacy around Israel and 
Palestine. What I did know, though, was how I 
was supposed to feel in regards to the issue at 
hand. Just by nature of my identity as a Jew, I 
knew that I was supposed to oppose the reso-
lution, oppose divestment and propose a narra-
tive of peace and dialogue around Israel. I knew 
this because Hillel told me so through the many 
e-mails I received affirming their opposition to 
BDS, and because of the many Facebook posts 
about all of the Hillel-sponsored Israel solidar-
ity efforts I could join.

After reaching out to one of the resolution’s 

authors, examining my own values in the con-
text of what was being asked of us as an assem-
bly and hours of extensive research, it intuitively 
made sense that I would support a resolution of 
this nature. I sat with a strong sense of cogni-
tive dissonance, weighing my moral and ethical 
values against my Jewish identity. Saying that I 
opposed the resolution felt morally inconsistent 
with my values, but saying that I supported it 
felt incredibly isolating.

With a public and political face that said no 

to the resolution, but a heart and a mind that 
said yes, I felt a moral tension that even today 
still hasn’t gone away. The way that the Jew-
ish community on campus received my ambi-
guity was what ultimately led me to finding 
my strength for the dissent. I have come to 
actualize my dissent in small ways since last 
March, from informing community members 
and friends of my personal support of eco-

nomic boycotts in Israel to exploring “Jewish 
Progressive Except for Palestine” identities 
in academic research.

The way that fellow Jews on campus treat-

ed me and other Jewish students who did not 
fully conform to the status quo Israel political 
belief was disheartening. My unwillingness 
to strongly oppose the resolution, demon-
ize its supporters and vocalize an unwaver-
ing dedication to the longevity of Israel as a 
divided state meant that I was no longer wor-
thy of their love, their friendship and, some-
times, our shared Jewish identity.

It took me a summer of research and reflec-

tion to understand why this PEP identity 
persists in the Jewish communities I have 
always identified with, and why it’s so hard 
to move past the cognitive dissonance cre-
ated by a resolution such as the one presented 
to me a year ago and the one being presented 
Tuesday night. I have come to understand 
my experience with BDS and Israel politics 
on campus in a larger social context, where 
there’s a Jewish communal standard and 
expectation for many historical, social and 
political reasons, which Jewish community 
members are expected to adhere to simply 
by the nature of being Jewish. My explora-
tion away from this status quo, of an Israel 
politic that is consistent with my values, 
is what led to the intra-communal silenc-
ing of political voice that I experienced 
 

on campus.

I think political dissent is naturally coupled 

with feelings of fear. For me, it was fear of 
political loss, personal isolation and commu-
nal rejection. I decided to sit silent in consent, 
weighed down by others’ constructed realities, 
instead of adhering to my values, my truths, my 
Judaism. But, more important than my own 
fears, identities and intra-communal politics 
are the silenced narratives of Palestinian stu-
dents on campus and our greater complacency 
in the human rights abuse that is Palestinian 
occupation. So while I didn’t dissent that day 
last March, I am dissenting now. I support 
SAFE’s resolution, I support economic sanc-
tions on Israel and I support the validation of

You know when someone you hate throws 

a party so you try to get all your friends to not 
go? In my experience, it usually doesn’t work 
that well and you just end up looking like an ass. 
How does the United States feel now that all of 
its friends have ignored its stern warnings and 
joined the Asian Infrastructure and Investment 
Bank anyways? This is the most dramatic 
diplomatic isolation of the United States since 
that whole Operation Iraqi Freedom debacle, so 
hopefully a little like an ass.

In 2014, China laid down $50 billion and its 

signature alongside 22 other Asian countries 
from Kuwait to Indonesia, creating the AIIB to 
finance infrastructure projects in the region. 
The United States tried cashing in on its 
diplomatic ties by coercing its global network 
of allies from joining the bank that has been 
formally endorsed by both the World Bank 
and IMF. Until this month, the tactic seemed 
to be working. But that was before the United 
Kingdom, which many Americans consider 
their closest ally, defected. Today, on the 
membership deadline, virtually every single 
major economy including U.S. allies such as 
Australia, South Korea and an entire concert 
of Western European pals, have joined. The 
only bitter holdouts are the United States, with 
Japan expecting to join.

The State Department’s (and Japan’s, for 

that matter) formal statement against the AIIB 
questions its regulations on issues such as 
environmental protection and human rights 
— how will these be considered when making 
loans? Please spare us these airs and graces. 
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch 
and various other NGOs have raised noise 
about the shady dealings of these American-
led institutions. John Perkins, a consultant 
who used to work with indebted developing 
countries, described how World Bank and 
IMF loans are almost publicity agreements 
to complement a sweeping privatization and 
deregulation of developing economies to fit 
nicely into the pocketbooks of American and 
European multinational corporations.

And despite their international scope 

and image, the World Bank and IMF are 
undoubtedly American-led institutions. This 
makes perfect sense — they were created in the 
1940s when the U.S. was beginning to assume 
its role as the global hegemon, but that was 70 
years ago. Nothing has changed. Despite being 
the world’s second largest economy, China 
only has only about 5 percent and 4 percent of 
total voting power in the World Bank and IMF, 
respectively, compared to 18 percent in both 
institutions by the United States. Just to put it 
in perspective, only a handful of countries have 
more than 1 percent of voting power in either 
institution, and the United States is the sole 
veto power in the World Bank.

China’s creation of the AIIB was an attempt 

at an institution that would better reflect the 
changing power relations of the modern world. 
This does not exclude the United States. Last 
I checked, the United States is still the world’s 
only superpower, and North Korea was the 
only country whose application was rejected 
from the AIIB. The U.S. blunder has not only 
damaged its credibility with allies, but also 
signaled an appallingly myopic refusal to 
cooperate with Beijing. If the United States is 
truly concerned about those regulatory “best 
practices,” what better way to improve the 
AIIB than from within?

Finally, let’s not forget that because the AIIB 

is a development bank, those who will pay the 
most for America’s inaction are not China, 
but developing countries who will receive aid 
from the AIIB. Investment from the wealthy 
United States would be translated into real 
improvements in the infrastructure developing 
countries. In the future, when AIIB loans start 
flowing across Asia, recipients will remember 
well that despite all the talk by President 
Obama about a pivot to the region, the United 
States was ultimately unwilling to do anything 
meaningful besides play childish popularity 
games.

Childish popularity games

W

hen I was a kid, the only 
thing I ever wanted to 
be was a comic book art-

ist. I spent hours 
alone in my room 
trying 
to 
copy 

the characters I 
adored, 
creating 

my own and build-
ing stories around 
them. 
Truth 
be 

told, what I really 
wanted was to be 
the superheroes I 
drew, but that was 
unlikely. My crime 
fighting abilities were capped off by 
a general lack of athleticism, and my 
green belt in taekwondo won’t be foil-
ing many villains.

But I could draw — so I sketched out 

characters and told my own stories, 
where I would invent new powers, 
build new teams of super people and 
flip the roles of villain and hero.

Much to my father’s relief, as I got 

older my interests shifted from comic 
books and superheroes to politics, law 
and civil rights. I had my future law 
school pegged down at 17, around the 
same time I found a new standard for 
heroism in the writing and speeches of 
Malcolm X.

Coming to college, I knew exactly 

where I was going: I’d find a life as a 
lawyer and a public servant, while 
— like Malcolm —I would become a 
leader on the vanguard of the fight for 
civil rights. Hell, I even ran for Central 
Student Government with the Defend 
Affirmative Action Party.

Like the comic heroes I drew as a 

kid, the heroes of social movements 
— current and former — do not have 
an easy life. Everyone wants to be 
Superman when he’s vanquishing vil-
lains and basking in the glory of sav-
ing planet Earth, but the life of a hero 
requires constant sacrifice that often 
becomes a burden.

Malcolm X is an icon today, but 

near the end of his life his home was 
firebombed, his friends turned against 
him and he was vilified by people 
Black and white, liberal and conser-
vative. Activists commit their lives to 
a cause, and the most heroic activists 
fight the most challenging, polarizing 

battles. Even for lawyers at well fund-
ed NGOs, the hours are long, the victo-
ries are few and the defeats are many. 
The people who do this kind of work 
often feel compelled, and they have a 
combination of fervor, talent and opti-
mism.

For a while, I thought that I was one 

of these people.

I fell in and out of various causes, 

all of which fit vaguely into the same, 
elaborate daydreams where I com-
mand a massive crowd of protesters 
or argue in front of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. I’ve been to my fair share of 
protests while I’ve been in college, 
typically serving as half demonstrator, 
half spectator.

As a junior, I traveled with other 

Daily writers to Washington, D.C. to 
cover a landmark case on affirmative 
action, an issue still close to my heart. 
Standing on the steps of the Supreme 
Court, Aarica Marsh — now my edi-
tor — and I looked out onto the slew of 
student protesters in red shirts chant-
ing for justice. After taking a few pho-
tos, I reluctantly agreed it was time 
for some interviews and wandered 
nervously into the demonstration. 
Writing my column later that night, 
rather than a screed for racial justice, 
I tried to weigh my support for affir-
mative action with my disillusionment 
toward the radical group BAMN.

Several months later, walking 

through a mostly empty campus, I 
heard chanting and came upon a vocal 
demonstration against the ongoing 
war in Gaza. The protesters demanded 
Palestinian liberation and a boycott of 
Israel. One sign stuck out, thanks in 
part to its neon color and liberal use of 
swastikas.

To protest a Jewish country.
I wanted to know why, and there 

was only one way to find out. My heart 
pounding, I wandered nervously into 
the center of the demonstration, found 
the man, and we spent a few minutes 
arguing. I wrote about it in my col-
umn, and despite my frustrations, I 
felt more knowledgeable because of it.

On March 26, on my way to a lec-

ture, I heard the familiar sounds of 
chanting and saw people on the Diag 
holding signs. Following my intuition, 
I wandered over to the demonstration, 

nervous as ever.

The rally was a warm up for an 

event on the 50th anniversary of the 
Teach-In Movement, this time the 
focus aimed firmly on climate change. 
I knew I had made the right decision 
when I saw a disheveled, unstable 
looking older man (this is an archetype 
of the protest genre) walking around 
with a sign labeled “Israel nuked NY 
City on 9/11.” I bit my knuckles trying 
to hold back my laughter, especially 
as he wandered from the crowd and 
directed his sign at a nearby campus 
tour group. I don’t know what this 
guy was thinking, or if he realized that 
the demonstration was about climate 
change, but if his sign was serious it 
really didn’t matter.

I regained my composure to listen to 

the speaker in the middle of the crowd, 
University alum and former campus 
radical Tom Hayden. I had wanted to 
meet Hayden since I came to Michi-
gan, as he was a legend in both student 
activism and the editorial pages of the 
Daily. After we made our way into the 
auditorium, I cornered Hayden and 
asked him for an interview, hoping my 
invocation of the Daily’s opinion sec-
tion would help me along. After a short 
conversation, Hayden was told he had 
a place reserved in the front. I told him 
I was almost finished, but instead he 
invited me to continue the interview 
among the other VIPs.

We talked for a while about his 

time on campus, then sat and watched 
an almost two-hour event featuring 
“Democracy Now!” host Amy Good-
man. As the program ended, he gave 
some parting words about the line 
between activism and journalism, and 
then he was off. I walked home with 
my adrenaline pumping, shaking my 
head and laughing as I thought about 
what just occurred.

Just like I’ll never get super powers, 

I will likely never be a Malcolm X or a 
Tom Hayden. But there are stories to 
be told, and I enjoy writing them. And 
deep down, I enjoy that feeling in the 
pit of my stomach, as I put one foot 
in front of the other and wander ner-
vously into the unknown.

ANDREW VAUGHN/AP

Airport firefighters work at the crash site of Air Canada AC624 that crashed early Sunday morning during a snowstorm, at Stanfield International Airport in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Monday, March 30. 
Toronto officials investigate 
plane crash on Halifax runway

Twenty-five 

taken to hospital 
following crash 

officials say 

TORONTO (AP) — An Air 

Canada passenger plane landed 
so significantly short of the run-
way in Halifax that it hit a power 
line and knocked out power at 
the airport, the lead investigator 
said Monday.

The Airbus 320 landed 1,100 

feet (335 meters) short of the 
runway during an early Sunday 
morning snowstorm. It crashed 
into a bank of antennas and 
sheared off its main landing gear, 
nose cone and an engine before 
skidding on its belly. Twenty-five 
people were taken to the hospital 

and all but one has been released.

Mike Cunningham, regional 

manager for Canada’s Trans-
portation Safety Board, said 
investigators are still trying to 
determine why Flight AC624 
from Toronto landed prema-
turely.

Cunningham said they inter-

viewed the pilots Sunday night 
but that he is prohibited from 
commenting about what they 
said. The cockpit voice recorder 
and flight data are being down-
loaded Monday.

The airport terminal build-

ing went black as the plane hit a 
power line outside several hun-
dred feet outside the airport.

“That’s pretty unique. The 

power line itself is well beyond 
the obstacle clearance criteria 
from that runway and that air-
craft touched down significantly 

short of the runway,” Cunning-
ham said in a telephone inter-
view with The Associated Press.

A power generator on the 

airfield kicked in so the lighting 
there was not affected but two 
generators failed in the termi-
nal building. The power outage 
meant an emergency response 
center had to be moved to a near-
by hotel. Nova Scotia Power later 
restored power, and police said a 
power line south of the runway 
outside airport property was 
damaged.

Cunningham said he’s sure the 

power outage was a contributing 
factor in the delayed response 
in retrieving the 133 passengers 
and five crew members. Passen-
gers complained they were left 
standing on the tarmac for up to 
50 minutes as they were lashed 
by wind-whipped snow before 

buses arrived. He said the length 
of time it took to respond will 
be a big part of their investiga-
tion. Halifax Stanfield Interna-
tional Airport spokesman Peter 
Spurway also said they are also 
conducting an investigation into 
their response.

“We can do better than that,” 

Spurway said. “The question is 
how do we move 138 people safe-
ly off a runway in a snowstorm 
at quarter to one on a Sunday 
morning.”

Spurway said they were lucky 

people weren’t seriously hurt. 
“We are hugely fortunate and 
they are hugely fortunate and we 
are very, very grateful for that,” 
he said.

The airport, Canada’s seventh 

largest with 3.6 million passen-
gers, reopened 5 ½ hours after 
the accident.

Investigators discover 
suspicious note in 
man’s apartment 

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) 

— Spence Jackson provided the 
official confirmation a month ago 
that his boss, Missouri Auditor 
Tom Schweich, was dead from 
what police described as a self-
inflicted gunshot wound.

On Monday, police confirmed 

that Jackson had shot himself in 
an apparent suicide — marking a 
second, stunning jolt to Missouri 
politics, though police declined 
to say whether the deaths were 
directly related.

Jackson was found dead Sun-

day evening in his home in Jef-
ferson City, police spokesman 
Capt. Doug Shoemaker said. He 
said investigators found a note in 
Jackson’s apartment, where the 
44-year-old lived alone, but he 
declined to detail what it said.

Schweich fatally shot himself 

at his home on Feb. 26, shortly 
after telling an Associated Press 
reporter he wanted to go public 
with allegations that the Missouri 
Republican Party chairman told 
people he was Jewish. Schweich, 
a Christian with Jewish ancestry, 
said he perceived the remarks to 
be part of an anti-Semitic whis-
pering campaign against him 
ahead of his run for governor.

Jackson, who was Schweich’s 

spokesman, was among the first 
to suggest that the GOP chair-
man, 
John 
Hancock, 
should 

resign. Hancock has denied mak-
ing anti-Semitic remarks, but said 
he may have mistakenly told peo-
ple last year that Schweich was 
Jewish. He remains chairman of 
the party, now roiled ahead of a 

2016 election featuring races for 
U.S. Senate, governor and most of 
Missouri’s other statewide execu-
tive offices.

“We’re very aware of the politi-

cal issues surrounding Mr. Sch-
weich’s death. And then within 
a month we have the death of his 
spokesperson,” Shoemaker said 
Monday.

He said Jefferson City investi-

gators have reached out to police 
in Clayton, the St. Louis suburb 
where Schweich lived, but that his 
department wouldn’t comment 
“or entertain questions that may 
link the deaths to a political issue, 
perceived or real.”

Jackson had worked in Mis-

souri political and state govern-
ment jobs for 15 years, including 
for former Missouri Gov. Matt 
Blunt. Blunt issued a statement 
Monday saying he was saddened 
to learn of his friend’s death.

“Spence was a gifted commu-

nicator who dedicated his talents 
in public affairs to public service,” 
Blunt said. “Spence was hard-
working, well-liked and quick-
witted.”

Jackson began working for 

Blunt as he ran for secretary of 
state in 2000 and rose with him 
as Blunt later became governor. 
Jackson also served as a spokes-
man for the state Department of 
Economic Development and for 
Sarah Steelman’s unsuccessful 
2008 gubernatorial bid. He joined 
Schweich’s staff at the auditor’s 
office in October 2011.

The Missouri House paused 

for a moment of silence Monday 
afternoon to remember Jackson.

State Auditor John Watson, 

who took over following Sch-
weich’s death, said Jackson was 
a respected, long-time servant in 
state government.

Personal information 
of Arizona policemen 
involved in shootings 

to remain public

PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona 

Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed leg-
islation Monday requiring law 
enforcement agencies to keep 
the names of officers involved 
in shootings secret for two 
months, nixing a bill that was 
inspired by last year’s events 
Ferguson, Missouri, and simi-
lar incidents around the coun-
try.

Ducey said in a lengthy veto 

letter that he sympathized 
with backers who sought to 
protect officers. But he said he 
listened most to police chiefs 
who told him that an arbitrary 
hold on releasing the names of 
officers would limit their abil-
ity to manage complex commu-
nity-police relations.

Legislatures 
around 
the 

nation are taking up various 
pieces of police shooting leg-
islation, including proposals 
requiring police to wear body 
cameras or mandating that 
shooting 
investigations 
be 

done by outside agencies. But 
Arizona is apparently the only 
state considering new rules for 
releasing the names of officers, 
said Ezekiel Edwards, director 
of the Criminal Law Reform 
Project at the American Civil 
Liberties Union.

Ducey, a Republican, faced 

pressure to veto the measure 

from police chiefs, who worried 
they couldn’t manage commu-
nity relations or stop unfounded 
rumors about an involved offi-
cer.

Police 
unions, 
however, 

supported the bill, saying the 
required two-month delay will 
give time for investigations to 
play out. They call it a com-
mon-sense measure that will 
ensure officer safety.

The death of Michael Brown 

in Ferguson, Missouri, drew 
intense criticism and wide-
spread protests last year. State 
Legislatures have been looking 
at police-transparency laws 
since Brown’s Aug. 8 shooting 
death by former police officer 
Darren Wilson, whose name 
was released a week later.

Tucson Police Chief Roberto 

Villasenor wrote to Ducey last 
week in his role as president 
of the Arizona Association of 
Chiefs of Police urging the 
veto.

In an interview, he said it 

would be wrong to ignore “the 
elephant in the room” of poor 
police-community 
relations 

that has been the highlight of 
much law enforcement news 
coverage in the past year.

“Enacting legislation that 

would hamper that trust by 
not allowing officers’ names to 
be released is not in my opin-
ion the best way to improve or 
repair that level of trust,” Vil-
lasenor said.

Republican lawmakers who 

backed the proposal said it was 
designed to protect officers.

“The simple fact remains 

that we live in a world where 
misinformation 
can 
put 

everybody in jeopardy, espe-
cially police officers,” state 
Sen. 
John 
Kavanagh 
said 

last week. “And until we get 
those facts straight, we need 
to shield those cops and their 
families from being assassi-
nated by lunatics or political 
zealots.”

Arizona public-records laws 

currently require the release 
of an officer’s name as soon 
as possible, unless the agency 
cites specific reasons for a tem-
porary delay. In practice, agen-
cies typically have released the 
name within several days but 
can hold off indefinitely if the 
officer’s safety is in jeopardy.

Ducey pointed to the option 

of withholding an officer’s 
name when necessary as a 
determining factor in his deci-
sion.

“There are many examples 

of our police departments 
exercising this authority in a 
manner that protects the offi-
cer’s identity while ultimately 
providing disclosure after the 
situation has cooled,” Ducey 
said in his veto letter.

The police chiefs and law-

yers for The Arizona Republic 
also pointed to provisions that 
might shield all police disci-
plinary records.

Ducey said those provisions 

“seem to stretch outside the 
scope of protecting officers 
and their families from unjus-
tified retaliation by creating 
new and expansive exceptions 
to the Public Records Act.”

Gov. vetoes bill to 
shield officer names

Homicide rate 
drops while city 
families remain 

frusterated

CHICAGO (AP) — A few 

years ago, violence on Chicago 
streets thrust a recently elected 
mayor into the national spot-
light as shootouts in some of the 
city’s most troubled neighbor-
hoods fueled nearly constant 
bloodshed.

Rahm Emanuel spent nearly 

$200 million over two years to 
flood those streets with police 
working overtime. His police 
department also collected a 
trove of information about indi-
vidual gang members and set up 
meetings between gang mem-
bers and the parents of homi-
cide victims to illustrate the 
high human cost of gunfire.

Since then, the city’s over-

all violence has declined, but 
the number of slayings in some 
minority neighborhoods actu-
ally jumped. And while police 
boast of historic drops in the 
homicide rate, many frustrated 
families in those areas say their 
communities have seen little to 
no improvement or have actu-
ally deteriorated.

“It’s worse,” said Anthony 

Jackson, a 62-year-old retired 
maintenance man as he made 
his way to his home in the heart 

of a neighborhood that last year 
saw a dramatic spike in homi-
cides — to about half the number 
of the entire city of Washington, 
D.C. “We’re just out here on our 
own.”

The stubborn violence con-

tributes to the mayor’s overall 
challenge in his bid for a sec-
ond term and puts him in the 
somewhat 
awkward 
position 

of simultaneously touting his 
success against crime while 
acknowledging that much more 
needs to be done.

“The truth is that as much 

progress as we’ve made over the 
past four years, we simply have 
to do better,” Emanuel said in a 
speech.

The total number of homi-

cides in Chicago fell from more 
than 500 in 2012 to just over 
400 last year, the lowest level in 
a half-century. But the number 
of shootings climbed 12 per-
cent, from 1,866 to 2,084, dur-
ing the same period.

The discontent goes beyond 

the bullets. Despite Emanuel’s 
success in attracting companies 
to the thriving Loop district, 
the only businesses that seem 
to survive in many minority 
neighborhoods are dusty mar-
kets, fast-food restaurants and 
dollar stores.

The result was that Emanuel 

did not receive enough votes 
last month to avoid an April 
runoff with Cook County Com-
missioner Jesus “Chuy” Garcia. 

Much of the support the mayor 
had from black voters four years 
ago vanished in the primary. 
Though Emanuel was the clear 
winner in every majority-black 
ward, he received fewer than 
half the votes in them. Four 
years ago, he received more 
than half the votes in every sin-
gle one.

Jackson voted for Emanuel in 

2011, but he doesn’t know who 
he will support in the April 7 
election.

In the Harrison police dis-

trict, where Jackson lives, the 
number of homicides climbed 
from 35 in 2013 to 51 last year, 
and the number of shootings 
climbed at more than double the 
citywide rate. Police have not 
offered a definitive reason other 
than to point to what Superin-
tendent Garry McCarthy calls 
“severe gang conflicts.”

And Emanuel’s decision to 

close dozens of schools added 
more boarded-up buildings to 
streets already littered with 
them, with residents complain-
ing that the schools became 
larger versions of the aban-
doned houses that are magnets 
for gangs and drug dealers.

“What people see is these 

parts of the city have been aban-
doned, and the investment has 
gone elsewhere,” said Marshall 
Hatch, a prominent minister on 
the city’s West Side, standing 
near the shuttered Goldblatt 
Elementary School.

DreamWorks’s 
newest picture 
sends writer into 
existential crisis

By JACOB RICH

 Daily Film Editor

DreamWorks’s “Home” is an 

animated children’s movie about 
aliens that invade Earth.

“Home” is a 

movie where you 
laugh 
because 

a 
machine 

that 
an 
alien 

thought 
would 

work 
doesn’t, 

and 
it 
makes 

him look very 
silly. You also 
laugh because the alien acciden-
tally drinks urine and that is also 
funny. You also laugh when the 
alien dances to music, because his 
movements are silly and do not 
resemble the way humans dance.

“Home” is also about a girl try-

ing to find her absent mother – 
because that is a relatable subject 
matter for many people and there 
aren’t very many movies about 
that. You relate to the girl because 
she understands what humans 
are like and the alien does not.

The aliens in “Home” are cute 

and cuddly, because people like to 

buy toys and plush dolls that look 
cute and cuddly like the other 
popular characters from popular 
animated movies.

The two people who recorded 

their voices for the main char-
acters in the movie are Jim Par-
sons (“The Big Bang Theory”) 
and Rihanna (“Wreck-It Ralph”), 
because they are big stars and 
people know them and would be 
more inclined to watch a movie 
that has them in it, regardless of 
whether their talents translate to 
an ounce of onscreen chemistry or 
any sort of skill that would apply 
to voicing an animated movie.

“Home” has animation that 

looks like the animation found in 
other popular animated movies. 
That’s good; it will provide good 
experience for the animators of 
“Home” to put on their resumes 
to get hired at places that make 
other popular animated movies.

I walked out of “Home” about 

an hour in, so I couldn’t tell you 
how the story ends. I was not 
the first person to get up and 
leave this particular showing at 
the Ann Arbor Quality 16, nor 
do I surmise I was the last.

“Home” is one of those 

movies that really makes you 
think about your life: your 
place 
here 
on 
this 
earth, 

your consciousness and the 
preciousness of every second. 
Someday, we will all die and 
regardless of your personal 

beliefs about the nature of 
death and the potential of new 
life afterward, your time living 
as you do now is limited.

Do not forget that you are a mir-

acle of nature. Do not ever spend 
less time with the people you love 
than you mean to.

Do not spend a single moment 

of your tragically short waking life 
watching “Home.” Do not spend 
another moment reading about 
“Home.” Do your absolute best to 
never, ever, think about “Home” 
again.

Instead, hug your mother and 

father. Look at a flower and really, 
truly 
attempt 
to 
comprehend 

its complexities, its beauty. Dive 
headfirst into a wonderful book and 
don’t lift your head up for hours. 
Donate some money to a charity. 
Eat, drink, have sex and laugh at 
the sheer absurdity of everything.

At the very least, watch an 

animated film that is worth your 
time, like “The Lego Movie,” “Big 
Hero 6” or “How to Train Your 
Dragon 2.”

I hope you live a long, wonder-

ful life.

Plush version coming soon.

We’re all 
dancin’ fools

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

Chatter and bodies surround 

you. 
You 
clutch 
your 
cup, 

slouched 
between 
friends 

gabbing on about something 
unimportant to you. In another 
room, someone turns on the 
music. As you are just able to 
make out the rolling bass beats, 
the tune is unidentifiable. The 
volume increases – this is your 
song. The mood of the room 
shifts; inhibitions are lowered 
and glasses are raised. You feel 
your toes begin to tap, soon 
followed by a slight sway of the 
hips and shrugging of shoulders. 
The feeling builds. You are no 
longer disengaged, slouching; 
you are dancing.

But what is it that makes us 

move? Are we even capable of 
pinpointing the universal factor 
that causes us to shimmy?

Let’s start with the basics – 

there has to be a beat. Not just 
any beat, but a pulsating rhythm 
that makes it impossible to stop 
your already drumming fingers. 
The tempo is essential, but 
variable: meaty, slow, ticking, 
quick. You have to feel it. As 
always, Whitney Houston did 
it best with “I Wanna Dance 
With Somebody.” The beat is the 
life force of a song; it drives the 
melody and drives your body.

Next, weave in that melody. If 

the beat is the bones, the tune is 
the flesh that draws you in. The 
instrumentation should dance 
just as you do – rising and falling 
playfully. If you haven’t already, 
stop what you are doing and go 
listen to the pinnacle of melodic 
perfection, “Can’t Stop Dancin’ ” 
by Becky G. It should be fun and 
catchy, but not necessarily from 

one certain instrument. You can 
rock out to electric guitar, jump 
around to electronic beats or get 
down to some funky synth.

But most importantly, this 

melody must build. Its peak is a 
chorus that is impossible to get 
out of your head – something 
you catch yourself humming for 
days. (I’m pretty sure I had “Call 
Me Maybe” stuck in my head 
for all of 2012.) We have all had 
those moments of stumbling our 
way through the verses of songs, 
waiting for the chorus to really 
bust out. This is one of the only 
times that clichés are used for 
good and not evil. Lyrics of living 
while you’re young and drunken 
escapades with friends enhance 
the effect of the chorus – the 
more ridiculous, the better. If 
you can bring yourself to listen, 
Pitbull is a perfect example of 
this kind of nonsensical lyric 
(but proceed with caution).

Ideally, the ultimate dance 

number will have an element of 
surprise: an unexpected drop, a 
standout lyric, a voice-over break 
a la “Oops!...I Did It Again,” etc. 
That “oh shit” moment is what 
takes a song and your dance 
moves, to the next level.

Aside from the music itself, it 

is important to remember that 
there is no right or wrong way 
to dance. Each person has his 
or her own boogie – whether it 
be a casual sway, a flirty wiggle 
or what seems to be a random 
flailing of limbs. Dancing is a 
personal way to convey your 
individual connection to music. 
There may be some ambiguous 
dance-factor to music, but that 
does not change the fact that 
you can shake it whenever and 
whichever way you want. Do 
your thing, you dancing fool.

Death Cab returns 
with dreamy new LP

By REGAN DETWILER

For The Daily

Death Cab for Cutie’s latest 

release 
and 
eighth 
studio 

album, Kintsugi, is quite simply 
a solid album. 
The 
band 

returns to a 
sound 
more 

similar 
to 

that of Plans 
and 
that 
of 

their previous 
experimental 
albums, 
keeping things exciting but 
thoroughly 
sticking 
to 
the 

musical style that has worked 
for them since the early 2000s.

Whereas the band used lots 

of ’80s alternative keyboard 
for their last album, Codes 
and 
Keys, 
Kintsugi 
shies 

away from this, allowing lead 
guitarist Chris Walla’s smooth 
and dreamy playing style to 
return to the spotlight. This 
may be because Walla, an 
original 
member 
recruited 

by lead singer Ben Gibbard, 
decided that this will be his 
last 
recording 
with 
Death 

Cab. 
Though 
Walla 
played 

the keyboard for Codes and 
Keys, he’s traditionally done 
guitar for the band, so a return 
to an indie-rock sound over 
alternative may be a tribute 
to this integral member’s last 
outing with the group.

The album opens with four 

singles that have been released 
throughout the year, including 
“No Room In Frame” and 
“Ghosts 
of 
Beverly 
Drive,” 

both of which have a firmly 
staccato beat but manage to 
still feel mellow in Death Cab’s 
characteristic way.

Another of these first four 

is “Black Sun,” which is a 
little bit of an outlier. This 
one seems like it tries to go for 
a certain mysteriously sexy 
sound that honestly reminds 
me of something out of a James 
Bond movie (not that we all 
don’t love 007), as Gibbard 

sings of a tempting and toxic 
love. Needless to say, this 
one diverges from the band’s 
usually 
lyrically 
emotive 

sound.

However, the last of the first 

four singles released, sounds 
very thoroughly Death Cab. 
“Little Wanderer” is much 
more 
melancholy 
in 
tone 

and 
reflective 
in 
meaning, 

where the singer’s lost love is 
somewhere 
abroad, 
leaving 

him asking, “Won’t you wander 
back to me?”

That sounds sappy, but this 

is Death Cab and that’s why 
we love their music. Keeping 
in the same tone are “You’ve 
Haunted Me All Your Life” 
and “Hold No Guns,” both very 
mellow and relaxing. These 
two are especially reminiscent 
of Plans, with heavy emphasis 
on Gibbard’s vocals, the over-
elongated vowels and over-

emphasized consonants which, 
when 
paired 
with 
echoing 

guitar and a subtle snare drum 
beat, somehow sound prophetic 
and allowing the music to 
speak to the most sappy and 
emotional 
realms 
of 
your 

music-listening faculties.

The album picks up with the 

next two tracks, but concludes 
with “Binary Sea,” which is as 
dreamy and mellow as a Death 
Cab fan could ask for. Without 
such a heavy emphasis on 
guitar, this last track features 
echoing 
vocals, 
piano 
and 

soft techno elements. If the 
last song on the album had a 
color, it would be a soft, light 
blue-green. Serene, peaceful 
and reflective, it’s a great 
conclusion for Walla.

All 
things 
considered, 

this 
album 
isn’t 
anything 

that 
diverges 
dramatically 

from 
the 
band’s 
previously 

explored styles. It successfully 
incorporates 
some 
of 
the 

darker 
themes 
explored 
in 

Narrow Stairs, as well as some 
more 80s alternative keyboard 
sounds explored in Codes and 
Keys, while somehow coming 
off as closer to the sound that 
originally brought them to the 
spotlight with Transatlanticism. 
There’s nothing too crazy going 
on here; just some good music to 
see out a longtime band member.

‘Iphigenia at Aulis’ 
comes to Walgreen

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

“One of the great anti-war 

plays, ‘Iphigenia,’ exemplifies 
how the momentum of war can 
propel 
indi-

viduals and a 
nation toward 
the 
unspeak-

able.” 
This 

is 
how 
the 

website 
for 

the School of 
Music, Theater 
and Dance bills 
its 
upcoming 

performance of 
the last surviv-
ing play of the 
ancient Greek 
tragedian 
Euripides, written at the end of 
the fifth century B.C.

“Iphigenia” 
examines 
the 

story of the ethical conflict 
over the sacrifice of Agamem-
non’s daughter, Iphigenia, in 
the prelude to the Trojan War. 
Agamemnon, the commander of 
the Greek forces, faces this deci-
sion because Athena is barring 
their travel to Troy and decides 
that a sacrifice of a family mem-
ber will appease her. But he has 
to grapple with doubt and hesi-
tation over this decision, and 
deals with a back-and-forth 
game of persuasion with his 
brother, Menelaus.

Euripides, writing against the 

backdrop of the Peloponnesian 
War, had war at the front of his 
mind. “Iphigenia at Aulis” was 
performed at the state-sanc-
tioned annual dramatic festival, 
the Dionysia, where it took first 
prize a year after the author’s 
death and a year before the end 

of the Peloponnesian War – the 
conflict that supplanted Ath-
ens as a major economic and 
political power, giving way to 
Spartan hegemony. Lysander, 
a Spartan commander, estab-
lished the oligarchic rule of the 
Thirty Tyrants in 404 B.C., dur-
ing which time Athenians faced 
land expropriations, state-legit-
imated murder and forced exile.

“I think (war) is something I 

constantly react to, and I think 
our students do, too. I just think 
it’s important for art, and the-
ater as one of the arts, to keep on 
reminding people that maybe we 
should be doing more to stop it,” 
said SMTD Professor Michael 
Tulip, director of the produc-
tion.

If literature is written in the 

confluence of historical, politi-
cal and social forces, then “Iphi-
genia” is no exception. Just 
because it was written 2421 
years ago does not mean that it 
was written in an indetermi-
nate 
then-and-not-now. 
And 

it is significant that Euripides 
was writing amid – or against 
– the Peloponnesian War, since 
Thucydides’s canonical account 
of the military conflict is one 
that influences military strat-
egy and historiography to this 
day. Victor Davis Hanson, a 
classicist and military historian 
who introduced “The Landmark 
Thucydides” is also someone 
who praised President George 
W. Bush’s decision to invade 
Iraq and advocated for strong 
responses to Iran.

Tulip and students of SMTD 

set their production of “Iphi-
genia” in the 21st century, 
foregrounding the resonances 
between Euripides’s anti-war 

play and the immediacy of anti-
war politics to our geopolitical 
situation.

“In terms of costumes, we 

are in 21st century Greece and 
the soldiers look like they could 
be in Desert Storm or Afghani-
stan, but without any emblems 
or anything to say that these are 
Americans or Greeks,” Tulip 
said. “We’re not doing any old 
robes or anything.”

Tulip said that he and the cast 

have 
emphasized 
movement 

and physicality in their produc-
tion as a means for enacting the 
internal ethical and affective 
conflict in and between each 
character.

“For me, I would say that the 

way we’re looking at this work, 
it’s almost like a cross between a 
wrestler, a dancer and a human 
being who has got a lot at stake,” 
Tulip said.

For Tulip and the SMTD cast, 

their production of Iphigenia 
always plays out at multiple levels. 
On the one hand, theirs is a theat-
rical project that emphasizes the 
duality between character and 
that character’s allegory in an 
ethical conflict in the context of 
war. On the other hand, there is 
the way that “Iphigenia” empha-
sized Euripides as an anti-war 
writer, and de-historicized and re-
historicized the piece all at once. It 
pulls Euripides’s play out of history 
to make comment on a time – ours 
– that is entirely not his. But read-
ing his work as an anti-war play 
also puts Euripides into context as 
someone who was responding to 
his contemporaneous geopolitics.

The Friday performances (April 

3 and April 10) will be followed 
by a talk-back session with the 
director, dramaturge and cast.

EVENT PREVIEW

‘Big Time’ letdown

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Two police officers stand over 

a suspect. Dark blues and greens 
contrast with the shining fluores-
cent light over 
their 
heads. 

The first offi-
cer 
(Lenny 

Jacobson, 
“Nurse Jack-
ie”) fails to get 
the criminal 
to talk. His 
partner (Alex 
Anfanger, 
“Secret 
Life of Wal-
ter 
Mitty”) 

holds up his 
lit cigar and 
says in Spanish, “You like to smoke 
cigars?”

“No,” the criminal glowers. “I 

like to smoke pigs.”

The cop laughs before respond-

ing, “I like Cubans. I love the way 
they burn.” He jams the cigar into 
the Cuban’s eye.

The man releases a tortured 

scream the wall behind him slowly 
rises, and bright light fills the room 
as the cops cry out, “Mom, we’re 
right in the middle of shooting!”

The tough-as-nails cops intro-

duced in the opening of “Big Time 
in Hollywood, FL” are revealed to 
be 30-something slacker brothers, 
Jack and Ben, played by Anfanger 
and Jacobson, respectively. The 
pair still live with their parents, 
the assertive Diana (Kathy Baker, 
“Medium”) and the submissive 
Alan (Stephen Tobolowsky, “Cali-

fornication”). The cinematic inter-
rogation is reduced by the show to 
a poorly done home movie that the 
siblings are convinced will help 
them make it big, in spite of the 
shaky camera works, jumpy editing 
and bad acting.

Jack and Ben live in a brightly 

lit world of ignorance. They have 
no skills, but their arrogant con-
fidence in their “abilities” knows 
no bounds. So, it’s understandable 
that Diana and Alan ask the two to 
move out. When confronted with 
this, the brothers’ first solution is 
to suggest to their mother, “There’d 
be more space if you divorce Dad.” 
When this doesn’t work, the next 
obvious course of action is to fulfill 
the episode’s title “Severance” by 
pretending Ben has a drug problem.

It would be easy for these two 

to fall into utterly despicable and 
unlikable territory, but series cre-
ators Anfanger and Dan Schimpf 
(“Next Time on Lonny”) imbue the 
characters with enough naiveté 
and arrested development that 
their schemes are more amusing 
than sinister. However, Jack is the 
more manipulative of the two, com-
fortably convincing Ben that he has 
to have the drug problem.

Amusing is the best way to 

describe “Big Time” ’s humor. The 
situations that the brothers find 
themselves can be ridiculous and 
most of the characters have a goofy 
charm to them. Tobolowsky’s door-
mat of a father, Alan, stands out as 
he only gets through disciplining 
his sons through Diana’s prodding. 
The antics seen in “Severance” are 
mostly worth an eyebrow raise or 
slight chuckle, and keep the view-

er interested, but the show never 
breaks into absolute hilarity for the 
majority of its first episode, skating 
by on well established man-child 
humor. Only in the show’s final act, 
where it goes into unexpected ter-
ritory, does the series begin to real-
ize its full comedic potential.

The pilot is boosted by the 

presence of guest star Ben Stiller 
(“Tropic Thunder”) as Jimmy Sta-
ats, a failed actor, that Jack and Ben 
enlist to play a drug dealer shaking 
Ben down for money. Staats’s own 
illusions of stardom trump even the 
central pair’s as he puts on his best 
C-grade version of Scarface – white 
suit, bad accent and all. Stiller owns 
the screen anytime he’s present in 
the episode, especially in the sur-
prising and hilarious final moments 
when the brothers’ light reality of 
self-delusion slips into a dark world 
of violence with Staats as the idi-
otic, ultimate victim. The shift in 
lighting back to the color scheme 
in the opening fantasy helps trig-
ger this change creating a contrast 
between the brothers’ fantasy and 
the real-world (albeit ridiculous) 
consequences they have to face in 
the upcoming episodes.

“Big Time in Hollywood, FL” 

finds itself within the well-known 
territory of Comedy Central slacker 
comedies with the likes of “Broad 
City” and “Workaholics,” but it has 
yet to reach the comedic heights its 
predecessors have displayed over 
the years. However, the amusing 
atmosphere of the show prevents 
it from ever being boring, and the 
off-the-rails ending to its first 
episode displays promise for Jack 
and Ben.

Michigan to face two 
MAC foes this week

Toledo, Central 
Michigan visit 
Wilpon Complex 

Tuesday, Wednesday 

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Winning two out of three 

games against No. 20 Maryland 
was 
undoubtedly 
a 
major 

achievement for the Michigan 
baseball team.

The Wolverines (14-12, 2-4 

Big Ten) will not be able to 
bask in their glory for long, 
though. 
Two 
Mid-American 

Conference 
teams 
stand 
in 

their way this week: Toledo on 
Tuesday and Central Michigan 
on Wednesday.

“I’m just focused on our next 

training session,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “Before we 
can even get to the next game, 
we have to focus on getting 
better.”

On the surface, the Rockets 

(9-18, 3-3 MAC), don’t appear 
to be a credible threat. The 
Wolverines defeated Toledo, 
19-5, back on March 7 at the 
Coastal Carolina Invitational, 
and the Rockets are coming off 
losing two out of three to Akron.

Alex 
Wagner, 
who 
has 

posted a 1-2 record with a 6.88 
earned-run average in seven 
appearances, 
will 
start 
for 

Toledo. The Wolverines will 
counter with redshirt junior 
right-handed 
pitcher 
Matt 

Ogden, who is 1-1 with a 4.91 
ERA.

But in order to prevent 

Michigan from coming down 
to Earth, Ogden will have to 
contend with the Rockets’ A.J. 
Montoya, who sports a .313 
batting average with five home 
runs.

Central Michigan (18-10, 5-1 

MAC), on the other hand, will 

likely be a more formidable foe. 
The Chippewas swept Miami 
(Ohio) last weekend, led by 
Logan Regnier, who is hitting 
.353 with 23 RBI. He went 4-for-
5 with three runs and four RBI 
in Central Michigan’s victory 
Friday. 

Not to be outdone, offense 

has been plentiful for the 
Wolverines thus far this season. 
Michigan leads the Big Ten with 
a .293 batting average and is 
second in the conference in hits 
(259), doubles (54) and on-base 
percentage (.374).

Senior centerfielder Jackson 

Glines is leading the way for the 
Wolverines, 
hitting 
.425 
with 

an 
on-base 

percentage of 
.519. He rests 
atop the Big 
Ten in both 
categories.

“I think we 

have a lot of 
really 
good 

hitters on this team,” said senior 
infielder Kyle Jusick. “When we 
put a lot of good at-bats together, 
we put up a lot of big numbers.”

But the hero of the series 

with the Terrapins was junior 
right-handed pitcher and third 
baseman Jacob Cronenworth. 
Normally 
Michigan’s 
closer, 

he started the first game of 
Saturday’s 
doubleheader, 

throwing 64 pitches in five 
innings, giving up two runs on 
three hits while striking out 
nine. The Wolverines’ offense 
came up short, though, and lost 
the contest, 3-1.

But it was Cronenworth’s 

bat that made the difference 
in Michigan’s 10-1 victory in 
Saturday’s second contest. He 
blasted a two-run home run in 
the second inning and belted 
a three-run triple in the fifth. 
Cronenworth’s success boosted 
his batting average to .305.

With Cronenworth expected 

to take on more starts going 
forward, 
expect 
to 
see 

freshman righty Bryan Pall 
take over the closer role. Pall 
boasts an 0.59 ERA with 14 
strikeouts this season, and 
earned his first career save in 
the Wolverines’ 5-2 triumph 
Sunday.

As for Michigan’s success 

against 
Maryland, 
it 
came 

despite some key contributors 
still sidelined with injuries. 
On the pitching staff, junior 
southpaw Evan Hill has yet to 
start this season, but should 
return soon.

“We’ll work 

(Hill) 
back 

in 
slowly,” 

Bakich 
said. 

“We’re 
not 

going to just 
run him out 
there in his 
first 
outing 

and 
expect 

him to pitch 
a 
complete 

game. But we’re really looking 
forward to getting him back. 
He’s a great teammate.”

At the plate, junior shortstop 

Travis Maezes — who hit .302 in 
2014 — has not been able to play 
since March 7.

“We thought we were going 

to have (Maezes) back this 
weekend (against Maryland),” 
Bakich said. “He’ll be ready any 
day now. He may not get to 100 
percent, but he needs to get to a 
point where he can compete and 
help the team win.”

So while it may be tempting 

for the Wolverines — with their 
ongoing goal of competing for a 
Big Ten championship — to look 
ahead to the upcoming three-
game series with conference foe 
Indiana next weekend, Toledo 
and Central Michigan cannot 
be ignored if Michigan wants 
to vie for a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Redshirt junior right-hander Matt Ogden, who is 1-1 with a 4.91 ERA, will start for Michigan on Tuesday against Toledo.

“We’re really 

looking forward 
to getting (Hill) 

back.”

Brooke Parker finds fit at Michigan

By CINDY YU

Daily Sports Writer

In just her second year on the 

Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team, Brooke Parker was voted 
captain by her teammates.

“That, in and of itself, speaks 

volumes,” said Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki.

Plocki 
emphasized 
the 

significance of the team voting 
for its captains, as they have 
the responsibility of leading the 
team. It is important for them to 
be respected, approachable and 
trustworthy.

Parker epitomizes all of the 

above, and more.

The 
senior 
from 
Lorton, 

Virginia 
transferred 
from 

Alabama after her sophomore 
year. She offers a unique angle 
to the sixth-ranked Wolverines 
(18-0 Big Ten, 21-2 overall), 
given that she started her career 
somewhere else.

“She’s very quick to bring 

another perspective and remind 
people that they have it better 
than 
most,” 
Plocki 
said. 
“I 

think she’s just so grateful for 
everything 
about 
Michigan 

because of where she’s coming 
from.”

At Alabama, Parker helped 

the Crimson Tide win the NCAA 
Championship her freshman year. 
She appeared in the floor lineup 
several times throughout her first 
two years of college gymnastics, 
but was unable to contribute as 
much as she would have liked to.

In comparison to Michigan’s 

squad of 14 this year, six of whom 
are freshman, Alabama boasted 
18 and 17 gymnasts on the team 
during Parker’s freshman and 
sophomore seasons, respectively.

“Alabama has a lot of really 

talented gymnasts,” Parker said, 
“so it’s really competitive to be 
inside the lineup.”

As a result, Parker decided to 

explore other options by visiting 
other universities during the 
summer of 2013.

When she visited Michigan, 

it was love at first sight for the 
4-foot-11 gymnast.

“The first thing that I realized 

was that (Michigan) helps you 
strive to be better inside and 
outside of the gym,” Parker said. 
“They really are the leaders and 
best.”

Parker 
prioritized 
earning 

an education from a prestigious 
university. 
Throughout 
high 

school, she was a successful 
student, but gymnastics took 
precedence. 
To 
accommodate 

for morning practices, Parker 
was home-schooled up until 10th 
grade. She promised herself that 
when she attended college, she 
would invest more time in her 
studies.

A two-time Scholastic All-

American 
according 
to 
the 

National Association of Collegiate 
Gymnastics 
Coaches/Women, 

Parker made the SEC Honor 

Roll and studied business when 
she attended Alabama. Had she 
continued her business education 
at Michigan, she would have had 
to stay an extra two years. Given 
that, she decided to pursue a 
general studies 
education 
with the intent 
of 
attending 

graduate 
school in Sport 
Management.

Her athletic 

scholarship 
inspired 
her 

to seek a job 
in 
athletic 

development.

“I really want to be a part of the 

event side so I can help coordinate 
events that give back to the 
donors for essentially everything 
they gave to Michigan,” Parker 
said.

Parker’s transition from the 

South to Midwest couldn’t have 
gone better. She has fit in better 
than her coaches could have 
hoped for.

The approach her coaches 

have taken resonates with her 

tremendously.

“They really 

do 
look 
at 

their 
athletes 

as people who 
are 
going 
to 

grow up and 
be a part of 
something way 
bigger than just 
a 
gymnastics 

team,” Parker 
said. “I think 

that outlook has really improved 
the way I walk into the gym, the 
atmosphere and everything about 
the program.”

Having been the only elite 

gymnast preparing at Capital 
Gymnastics National Training 

Center from the eighth grade 
until high school graduation, 
Parker has made several leaps.

Her 
co-captain 
this 
year, 

senior Annette Miele, helped 
ease the transition. The two have 
known each other since their club 
gymnastics days. Both competed 
in Region 7 and in 2009, qualified 
for the Visa Championships, the 
highest level of elite gymnastics 
in the nation. Parker earned 
senior international elite status 
and had the opportunity to 
compete alongside Olympians 
Nastia Liukin and Alexandra 
Raisman.

Parker was ecstatic about the 

news that she would be leading 
the team with Miele.

“It’s honestly one of the best 

things I think that could have 
happened,” Parker said. “It’s 
just really great going through it 
with someone that I have known 
forever.”

The two exhibit different 

leadership styles. While Miele is 
more of the mother figure on the 
team, Parker is the energizer.

Parker’s ability to not only 

uplift her teammates, but also 
make people laugh shows how 
comfortable she is at Michigan 
and makes her personality so 
contagious.

One 
of 
Parker’s 
greatest 

improvements 
since 
joining 

the Wolverines has been her 
confidence.

“When she first got here, 

she just really lacked in having 
confidence in herself,” Plocki said. 
“I could see from the beginning 
that the talent was absolutely 
there, but that she just needed to 
believe in herself more in order 
to allow herself to perform at 
the level that she’s capable of 
performing at.”

Indeed, Parker has gained 

consistency and confidence in her 
gymnastics. While she competed 
sparingly on floor and vault her 
junior year, she has competed in 
both events every meet this year. 
She is also the first alternate for 
the balance beam and has been a 
major contributor on the uneven 
bars.

A key factor to her bar routine 

was switching her dismount. 
Having experimented with a full-
in and double layout, Parker was 
able to learn a new double-front 
dismount that she has been able 
to execute consistently.

Parker earned second team All-

Big Ten honors and led Michigan 
to a Big Ten Championships 
win last Saturday. While her 
leadership and performance is 
approaching an exceptional level, 
if Michigan hopes to compete 
for the NCAA title in April, both 
attributes will have to be present 
at an even higher level.

Regardless of her tenure on the 

team, Parker’s ability on and off 
the floor is beyond justified.

“My only regret,” Plocki said, 

“is (that) I wish I had her for 
another year or two.”

LUNA ANNA ARCHEY/Daily

Senior Brooke Parker quickly became a captain for the Michigan women’s gymnastics team after two years and a national championship at Alabama.

“It’s honestly one 
of the best things 
that could have 

happened.”

It’s time for 

another banner

T

wenty-five banners hang 
in Crisler Center.

Three Michigan teams 

compete in 
the 12,707-
seat gym. On 
that stage, 
countless 
hours 
have been 
dedicated 
to winning 
tournaments, 
Big Ten 
titles and 
sometimes, 
on those glorious days that 
fans of the University crave 
to see once again, national 
championships.

Both basketball squads and 

the women’s gymnastics team 
call Crisler home. The athletes of 
the winning teams enter the gym 
on the day of a competition and 
look up at the rafters, comforted 
by their history and compelled to 
keep that success alive.

Out of 25 banners, however, 

not one belongs to the Michigan 
women’s basketball team.

They aren’t comforted by the 

rafters.

To them, it’s an empty space. 

It lacks history, with nothing 
to show for the toil of the past 
41 years. But that doesn’t mean 
darkness isn’t compelling.

Thursday, after the 

Wolverines’ dominant win over 
Missouri pushed Michigan into 
the quarterfinals of the WNIT, it 
appeared that a new era could be 
on the horizon.

Athletic Director Jim Hackett 

stood up from his courtside seat 
and strode over to coach Kim 
Barnes Arico to congratulate her 
on the victory. Together, they 
walked over to men’s basketball 
coach John Beilein and his wife, 
Kathleen.

Beilein couldn’t help but smile, 

realizing that despite his team’s 
struggles this season, a banner 
could still be raised next to his 

program’s collection.

But now it’s time for Barnes 

Arico to earn one of her own.

All three seniors are fighting 

in every game to make sure it’s 
not their last. The most notable 
example is forward Nicole 
Elmblad, who 
is continually 
raising the bar 
when it counts.

After 

averaging 7.4 
points and 6.8 
rebounds in 
the regular 
season, she’s 
now averaging 
9.0 points and 
8.5 rebounds 
in the WNIT. During Sunday’s 
quarterfinal game, she scored 14 
points, just ahead of senior guard 
Shannon Smith, who tallied 11 
points, and just behind senior 
forward Cyesha Goree, who 
scored 15.

“Once we came back (from 

the Big Ten Tournament), we 
knew we had a lot of work to 
do,” Goree said after defeating 
Cleveland State in the WNIT 
opener. “Everybody really 
committed to being checked in, 
focused on being able to still do 
something that hasn’t been done 
yet. A WNIT championship (for 
Michigan) has not been done yet.

“There’s no reason to hang 

your head right now, because you 
still can do something great for 
this program.”

Wednesday, during the 

semifinals of the WNIT, they can 
do just that. They already know 
their names will be in the record 
books. Elmblad has played in 
131 games, the most in program 
history. Goree has eclipsed 300 
rebounds in two seasons, the 
only Michigan player ever to do 
so, and Smith is one of just seven 
Wolverines in school history to 
score at least 36 points in a single 
game.

But it’s safe to assume they 

want something more symbolic 
than a name and a year next to 
statistics. A WNIT title would 
represent what the team has 
done collectively, symbolizing 
something much larger than just 
individual feats.

This is 

Barnes Arico’s 
third year, but 
she has already 
made an 
instant impact. 
In her first 
year, she led 
the team to the 
second round 
of the NCAA 
Tournament. 
In her second, 

Michigan made it to the third 
round of the WNIT. And now, 
the Wolverines are playing 
in April for the first time in 
program history.

The future is bright for 

Michigan.

Freshman guard Katelynn 

Flaherty leads the team in points, 
averaging 14.3 points per game. 
The younger players are getting a 
great deal of postseason practice, 
so it would come as no surprise 
if they made a run in the NCAA 
Tournament next year. The 
Wolverines have entered a new 
phase of Michigan basketball, 
one that’s past rebuilding.

Before the first game of the 

2015-16 season is even played, 
expect Barnes Arico and the 
Wolverines to watch a banner-
raising ceremony of their own. 
Expect the athletic director to 
be there, and maybe even the 
Beileins.

Most of all, expect the faces of 

Michigan women’s basketball to 
look up at the rafters to see that 
26th banner, and watch them 
be compelled to put another 
alongside it.

Montemarano, Swearingen 
battle for time at third base

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Roughly 20 minutes before 

the start of every Michigan 
softball 
game, 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins submits her lineup 
card to the home-plate umpire. 
After 36 games, there are some 
positions so well established 
that a fan could bet on the names 
being scribbled on that card.

At this point, it’s clear that 

junior 
Sierra 
Romero 
will 

anchor the infield at second base. 
Sophomore Kelly Christner will 
hold down her territory in left 
field.

But third base isn’t a position 

fans should be putting their 
money on, as sophomore Lindsay 
Montemarano 
and 
freshman 

Taylor Swearingen have been 
vying for the starting position as 
of late.

Montemarano has a .200 

batting average and .360 on-base 
percentage, while Swearingen’s 
numbers are .245 and .457, 
respectively.

This season, Montemarano 

has started twice as many games 
as Swearingen at third, but 
things can change quickly.

In the first 23 games this 

season, Montemarano started 19 
games compared to Swearingen’s 

four. In the previous 13 games, 
the time spent at the hot corner 
has swayed in Swearingen’s 
favor. Swearingen has been 
positioned at third in eight of 
the 13 contests, claiming the 
majority of starts.

But to say that Swearingen 

has officially taken over as 
the 
starting 
third 
baseman 

for Michigan wouldn’t be fair. 
There are more factors that play 
into this position battle than just 
who has inherited the bulk of the 
starts lately.

Montemarano and Swearingen 

have similar skill sets on the 
defensive end, recording just four 
and two errors, respectively.

There is no denying that 

Montemarano 
has 
played 

against stiffer competition than 
Swearingen. She started every 
game against No. 1 Florida, No. 5 
Florida State and No. 6 Alabama. 
She also notched two starts 
against No. 10 Arizona State.

Despite bearing the largest 

burden 
against 
ranked 

teams, Montemarano has not 
consistently produced. She has 
posted a batting average below 
.100 and recorded just two walks 
against ranked opponents.

In contrast to the veteran, 

Swearingen has faced only two 
ranked 
opponents: 
then-No. 

10 Arizona State and then-No. 
9 Baylor. Though it’s a smaller 
sample size, she did not fare 
much better than Montemarano 
against her toughest adversaries, 
going 1-for-6 at the plate.

But in the Big Ten opening 

series 
against 
Ohio 
State, 

Swearingen impressed. She went 
2-for-5 with two home runs and 
three RBI. Her performance 
against the Buckeyes earned her 
significant time at third against 
Iowa.

Both have struggled at the 

plate against elite pitching, but 
Swearingen boasts a higher 
season 
batting 
average 
and 

slugging 
percentage 
than 

Montemarano.

For two defensive equals 

competing for a spot in a 
Wolverines lineup where one can 
often earn a starting spot with 
their bat, Swearingen appears 
to be the strongest candidate 
at the moment. Her frequent 
appearances in Big Ten play as 
of late suggest that Michigan 
may be closer to solidifying the 
freshman as the newest starter 
to the infield lineup.

For now, though, the scales 

are tipping in Swearingen’s 
favor, nothing is certain when it 
comes to Hutchins’ game-time 
decisions at third base.
