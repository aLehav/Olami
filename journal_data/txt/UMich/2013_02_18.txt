DailyStaffReporter
As the senior-year blues
hits, the question comes tum-
bling right behind: What next?
While many, may consider
graduate school, an advanced
degree may not be for every-
one.
Louise Jackson, career coor-
dinator for the Alumni Asso-

undergraduates into three
categories: students taking a
gap-year between undergradu-
ate and graduate degrees, stu-
dents with secured job prior to
graduation and those who plan
to go to graduate school.
However, those with
secured positions tend to be
in the minority, Jackson said.
When asked whether or not

Taylor shares his
story at leadership
conference
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
On Saturday afternoon,
about 100 undergraduate stu-
dents and University employ-
ees gathered in Couzens
Residence Hall for the Student
Housing Leadership Confer-
ence featuring speeches from
University administrators and
Michigan football legend Billy
Taylor.

E. Royster Harper, the
University's vice president of
student affairs, presented the
"Connecting the Dots" theme
of the conference, referenc-
ing the future implications of
present decisions.
Harper went on to intro-
duce Taylor, followed by a
preview for "Perseverance,"
a movie biography about his
life and battle with alcohol-
ism. Following the film, Taylor
explained how these experi-
ences helped mold him into
who he is today.
Taylor was a football legend
at Michigan, as the All Time U
of M record holder for average

rushing yards per game at 102
yards, a three-time All-Ameri-
can Running Back and Michi-
gan's MVP in 1971, according
to his website.
However, his life went on
a downward spiral on Jan. 4,
1972. Just a few days after his
final game as a Wolverine, his
mother passed away from a
heart attack.
"All I could do was cry,"
Taylor said. "It really knocked
me down."
Taylor said he sunk into
depression, but attended the

University expands extracurricular options

75 years ago this week
(Feb.18,1938):
The University opened up
more than 100 different extra-
curricular activities for second-
semester freshmen to join.
Students were required to
have at least a "C" average with
at least one "B" during their first
semester to participate. Transfer
students were also required to
meet these standards and had to
have spent at least one semester
at the University prior to joining.
The Daily published a list of
the newly available clubs, which
included the Engineering Coun-
cil, the school baqd, the Lawyers
Club, and Greek organizations
such as Phi Beta Kappa, Phi
Kappa Phi and Sigma Chi.

40 years ago this week
(Feb. 20,1973):
University faculty voted
against voluntary racial identifi-
cations on University job applica-
tions.
The idea was originally pro-
posed by Affirmative Action
Director Nellie Varner who
claimed that racial identifica-
tions would "help evaluate how
efficiently the University is meet-
ing government requirements for
minority employment."
Many staff voters feared that
this information would be "mis-
used" and worried about the
long-term consequences of this
practice.
20 years ago this week
(Feb. 18,1993):

Paul Spradlin, the Univer-
sity director of plant expan-
sion, announced renovations to
the East Engineering, Randall
Laboratory and Undergraduate
Library buildings.
East Engineering was to be
renovated, Randall Laboratory
expanded and the UGLi both ren-
ovated and expanded.
"The Undergraduate Library,
of course, is being renovated
because we're moving the sci-
ence libraries into the building
and need more space," Spradlin
said. "The Randall Lab is simply
a question of the physics depart-
ment not having enough space
and we have to add on."

Pope blesses crowd

100,000 attend one

VATICAN CITY (AP) - His
arms outstretched in a symbolic
embrace, Pope Benedict XVI
blessed tens of thousands of
cheering people on Sunday in one
of his last appearances as pontiff
from his window overlooking St.

Peter's Square.
Last week, 85-year-old
Benedict shocked the world by
announcing his resignation. He

as the city braces for faithful to
flock to Rome for the election and
installation of the cardinal who
will succeed Benedict as leader of
the world's1.2 billion Catholics.
Rome Mayor Gianni Ale-
manno said upward of 100,000
people turned out Sunday and
that everything went smoothly.
But while there was still space in
St. Peter's Square for more, many
couldn't get in - or easily out -
because entrances from the main
boulevard were just too narrow.
The huge crowd - including
parents with babies in carriag-
es and strollers, elderly people
using canes, and the disabled in
wheelchairs - tried to squeeze
through two spaces police left
open in the metal barricades
edgingthe square. Some people
panicked or called out to police
to help them get in or out of the
square.
Pilgrims and tourists had
an easier time if they entered
throughspacesintheelegantcol-
onnade that architect Gianloren-
zo Bernini designed to cradle the
sides of the St. Peter's Square.
Benedict seemed touched
by the outpouring of affection
after his decision to go down
in history as the first pontiff in
some 600 years to resign. The
pontiff told cardinals last week
thathe no longerhasthe mental
and physical stamina to vigor-
ously shepherd the church.
Looking into hazy sunshine
Sunday, he smiled shyly at the
sight of the crowd below, filled
with pilgrims waving their
countries' flags and holding up
banners with words of support.
One group of Italians raised a
banner which read: "We love
you."
Speaking in Italian, the
pope told the cheering crowd:
"Thanks for turnout in such
numbers! This, too, is a sign of
the affection and the spiritual
closeness that you are giving
me in these days.' He stretched
out his arms as if to embrace
the faithful from across the vast
expanse of the square.

on the exchange's website for
the Triumph turns up its certifi-
cations for things like passenger
safety and pollution prevention
as well as inspections. No vio-
lations or red flags are immedi-
ately evident. Searching a little
deeper, the most recent report
shows a propulsion issue from
a Jan. 28 incident involving a
short in a connection box of one
of the ship's generators.
But the cause of the fire that
crippled the Triumph is still
under investigation. Carnival
spokesman Vance Gulliksen
said Saturday that he could not
comment yet on damage, time-
line or estimated costs. In the
meantime, the ship is expected
to remain docked in Mobile to
be cleaned and sanitized before
it's back on open waters.
The U.S. Coast Guard and the
National Transportation Safety
Board will lend their exper-
tise to the investigation, but in
a support role. The probe will
be led by the Bahamas Mari-
time Authority, where Carnival
registers or "flags" some of its
ships. The arrangement is com-
monplace under international
maritime law, and it puts U.S.
agencies and investigators in a
secondary position even though
the Triumph and other Carnival
ships sail out of U.S. ports with
primarily American customers.

Colleges struggle
when students
drop out, keep aid
Students who get federal
grants but don't attend school are
leaving Michigan colleges with a
bill worth millions of dollars.
When students don't spend
the money on approved expens-
es, colleges, especially two-year
schools, are turning to tuition
increases to repay the federal gov-
ernment, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
Henry Ford Community Col-
lege in Dearborn is on the hook
for $4.1 million. Oakland Com-
munity College in Southfield owes
$700,000 from last semester after
1,000 students with grants didn't
show up for classes, the Detroit
Free Press reported.
Students who don't use the
full amount of their Pell Grant
often get a check for the balance
from the school. But schools can
be held responsible if students
then drop out and don't spend the
money properly.

Meteor-damaged
windows fixed in
Russian city
Authorities in a Russian city
say more than half of the acres of
windows smashed in the city by
an exploding meteor's shock wave
have been replaced.
Friday's explosion, estimat-
ed to be equivalent to several
atomic bombs, shattered glass
in more than 4,000 buildings in
Chelyabinsk and the surrounding
region, leaving residents vulner-
able in temperatures well below
freezing.
About 1,200 people were
injured, mostly by broken glass,
with 40 still hospitalized Sunday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said,
citing Emergency Ministry figures.
The Chelyabinsk city admin-
istration said in a Sunday state-
ment that nearly 60 percent of the
city's broken windows had been
replaced.
* Pieces of the meteor are
believed to have fallen into an ice-
covered lake about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) outside the city, but
no fragments have been reported

Benghazi, and he bled to death
in the arms of his teenage
daughter.
As Libya on Sunday marked
the second anniversary of
the start of the uprising that
toppled Gadhafi, the death of
el-Dersi and nearly 40 other
similar slayings are seen as
evidence that some in the
country are too impatient for
a political system that has yet
to deliver justice and national
reconciliation.
Suspicion in many of the
killings of senior security and
military officials has fallen on
Islamists who were brutally
suppressed under Gadhafi.
Now, they have become among
the most powerful groups in
the new Libya, particularly in
the east, with heavily armed
militias at their command.
And they are settling old

scores themselves, rather than
wait for transitional justice -
the process of society punish-
ing or forgiving the abuses of
the old regime.
Mustafa al-Kufi, a 59-year-
old former prisoner and polit-
ical activist, said the various
post-Gadhafi governments
and the current parliament
are all fearful that if they
head down the path of tran-
sitional justice, many mem-
bers of the ruling class would
be among those punished for
past wrongdoing.
"This is a very pressing
issue and a core demand in the
street," said al-Kufi, who spent
12 years in prison under Gad-
hafi.
"We need to know who did
what and then ask families of
the victims for forgiveness.
But since this didn't take place,
violence will continue because
there is no justice.
Like other Arab countries
that ousted authoritarian lead-
ers, Libya is now mired in a
chaotic and violent transition
to a new society. It is plagued
by unruly and heavily armed
militias that have slowly come
under a unified command but
remain filled with hard-liners
who were in the front line in

the war against Gadhafi.
The transition is further
complicated by an autonomy
movement in the oil-rich east,
a central government too weak
to exert its authority across
the vast desert nation, and
heavily armed Islamic extrem-
ists who are pressing to fill a
power vacuum.
The civil war swept Gadhafi
from power, but the bitterness
and rage lingers in a country
where the authoritarian gov-
ernment imprisoned, tortured
and killed its opponents.
Hana al-Gallal, a prominent
Benghazi lawyer, said allow-
ing old regime figures to be
part of the new order will only
fuel more violence.
"Those whose sons were
killed, their dreams shattered
by the Gadhafi regime, will
seek revenge when they see
them back in power," she said.
"The result is assassinations."
Some of the anger is direct-
ed at those who were in the old
government - from low-level
police officials to ex-ministers
who are now police chiefs and
lawmakers. That has prompt-
ed a push to prevent those
with ties to the former leader-
ship from serving in positions
of power.

Move will likely
limit U.S. advantage
as Obama draws
war to an end
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Angry over civilian deaths, Presi-
dent Hamid Karzai announced
plans Saturday to ban Afghan
security forces from requesting
international airstrikes on resi-
dential areas.
If he issues the decree as
promised, the move would pose a
significant new challenge to gov-
ernment troops who have relied
heavily on foreign air power to
give them an advantage against
insurgents on the battlefield even
as the U.S. and other countries
prepare to end their combat mis-
sion in less than two years.
The declaration came as
anger- mounted over a joint
Afghan-NATO operation this
week that Afghan officials said
killed 10 civilians, including
women and children, in north-
east Kunar province.
"I will issue a decree tomor-
row that no Afghan security
forces, in any circumstances, in
any circumstances can ask for the
foreigners' planes for carrying
out operations on our homes and
villages," Karzai said in a speech
at the Afghan National Military
Academy in Kabul.
Civilian deaths at the hands
of foreign forces, particularly
airstrikes, have been among
the most divisive issues of the
11-year-old war and have compli-
cated negotiations for a bilateral
security agreement that would
govern the foreign presence in
the country after 2014.
The U.S.-led coalition has
implemented measures to miti-
gate them, but the Afghan mili-
tary also relies heavily on air
support to gain an upper hand
in the fight against Taliban mili-
tants and other insurgents.
Many Afghan and interna-
tional officials have expressed
concern that the impending
withdrawal of international
combat forces by the end of 2014
will deprive government secu-
rity forces of that crucial weap
on. President Barack Obama has
announced that he will withdraw
about half of the 66,000 U.S.
troops in Afghanistan within a
year.
Karzai has frequently
denounced airstrikes and even
demanded that they cease. But
his speech Saturday was the first
time he threatened to formalize
his concern with a decree.
The U.S.-led military coalition
already said in June that it would

limit airstrikes to a self-defense
weapon of last resort for troops.
That followed a bombardment
that killed 18 civilians celebrat-
ing a wedding in Logar province,
which drew an apology from the
American commander.
Afghan and coalition offi-
cials frequently offer differing
accounts of military operations,
with local residents claiming
civilians were killed while for-
eign troops insist they targeted
insurgents. The line is often
blurred because insurgents don't
wear a uniform and are usually
part of the community, with air-
strikes and night raids hitting
areas where women and children
also are asleep.
The U.N. mission in Afghani-
stan said 83 civilians were killed
and 46 wounded in aerial attacks
by international military forces in
the first half of 2012. That figure
was down 23 percent from the
same period of 2011, which was
the deadliest year on record for
civilians in the Afghan war. It said
two-thirds of the casualties last
year were women and children.
Jamie Graybeal, a spokes-
man for the U.S.-led coalition,
declined to comment on Karzai's
remarks because alliance officials
had not seen the decree.
But Gen. John Allen, the for-
mer top commander of U.S. and
NATO forces in Afghanistan,
said before leaving that the coali-
tion can provide air support to
troops on the ground anywhere
in Afghanistan within 12 min-
utes of a request. He said Afghan
forces would have to get used to
not having the same abilities in
the future.
Karzai said Allen's successor,
U.S. Gen. Joseph Dunford, told
him that Afghanistan's intel-
ligence agency, the National
Directorate of Security, had
requested the airstrike late Tues-
day in Kunar's Shigal district,
which borders Pakistan. When
Dunford met with Karzai two
days later, the coalition said the
general expressed "his personal
condolences for any civilians who
may have died or been injured
as a result of the operation" and
said investigators were trying to
assess what happened.
Karzai said Afghan forces
were ready to take over their own
security despite concerns about
persistent violence that have cast
doubt on their capabilities.
"We are happy that foreign
forces are withdrawing from
our country," he said. "We are
happy for all their help and
assistance so far, but we don't
need foreign forces to defend
our country. We want our
Afghan forces to defend their
homeland."

GOP foes of Hagel nomination say
confirmation vote should continue

Critics say decision
will hinge on
coming disclosures
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP)
- Republican opponents of for-
mer Sen. Chuck Hagel's stalled
bid to become defense secre-
tary said Sunday that they'll
probably allow his Senate
confirmation vote to proceed
unless material more damaging
to the nominee - and, by exten-
sion, the Obama administration
- surfaces in the coming week.
Critics said the decorated
Vietnam combat veteran is a
"radical" unqualified to lead
the U.S. military. A top White
House official expressed "grave
concern" over the delayed con-
firmation vote, adding that
there was nothing to worry
about in any disclosures that
may yet come.
"No, I don't believe he's
qualified," Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said of his fellow
Republican and former Senate
colleague. "But I don't believe
that we should hold up his nom-
ination any further, because I
think it's (been) a reasonable
amount of time to have ques-
tions answered."
McCain and other Repub-
licans have angered President
Barack Obama by delaying him
from rounding out his second-
term national security team,
which includes Hagel and John
Brennan, the White House
counterterrorism adviser who
is awaiting confirmation to
become CIA director. Former
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry
assumed his post as secretary
of state at the beginning of Feb-
ruary.
Critics contend that Hagel,
who snubbed McCain by stay-
ing neutral in the 2008 presi-
dential race between McCain

and Obama, isn't supportive
enough of U.S. ally Israel and
is unreasonably sympathetic to
Iran, which has defied interna-
tional pressure to halt its pur-
suit of material that could be
used to make nuclear weapons.
Hagel's nomination also
became ensnared in Republi-
can lawmakers' questioning of
how the White House handled
the Sept. 11 attack against a U.S.
diplomatic mission in Benghazi,
Libya, in which the U.S. ambas-
sador and three other Ameri-
cans were killed. Hagel was not
involved in the administration's
response.
GOP senators also have chal-
lenged Hagel's past statements
and votes on nuclear weapons,
and his criticism of President
George W. Bush's administration.
Republicans last week
delayed a confirmation vote,
but have indicated that one
will be allowed when senators
return from a break on Feb. 25.
Sen. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., another leader of the
opposition to Hagel, referred to
a letter he received from Hagel
in response to questions about
past statements on Israel. Gra-
ham said that, as a result, he'll
take Hagel "at his word, unless
something new comes along."
Still, the weeklong delay
buys Hagel's opponents even
more time to rally additional
opposition.
White House chief of staff
Denis McDonough, making his
first appearances on the Sunday
talk shows in his new role, was
asked if the delays in filling out
Obama's Cabinet presented a
threat to national security.
"It's a grave concern," he
said.
Hagel "has one thing in
mind: how do we protect the
country," McDonough said,
adding that there was nothing
to worry about in any disclo-

sures about Hagel that may still
come.
Graham said senators were
taking seriously their respon-
sibility to scrutinize "one of the
most unqualified, radical choic-
es for secretary of defense in a
very long time."
Last week, Obama criticized
Republican senators for delay-
ing the nomination, accusing
them of playing politics with
national security.

Quality over quantity
CSG should focus on broad, progressive goals in the future
As Business senior Manish Parikh's term as president of Cen-
tral Student Government enters its concluding months, he
visited the Michigan Daily's editorial board on Thursday to
have a candid conversation about CSG's progress and what's yet to
come. Over the past year, Parikh has fulfilled many of his campaign
promises and made some changes designed by the student body.
CSG's most important accomplishment may be legitimizing the role
of student government here at the University. Last March's election
had a historic voter turnout - a trend we hope to see continue. But
CSG leaders - current and future - need to continue the proactive
trend set by Parikh by striving to be the connection between students
and administrators, as well as advocating for socially progressive ini-
tiatives like the Coalition for Tuition Equality.

According to the Daily, University
Police spokeswoman Diane Brown
explained that the lack of a crime

because "the crime did not occur on

al assault in its legal definition."
A reason for the failure to post a

KATIE was not offered.

doesn't mean it's not
a threat to students.
But you know what? A fur-
ther scroll down past crime alerts
reveals, July 6, 2012: "Attempted
Sexual Assault off-campus." That
was off-campus and an "unsuccess-
ful" rape, and we still got a crime
alert. So, why the inconsistency?
I want togo back to the University
Police's claim that the Feb. 10 inci-
dent "does not involve sexual assault
in its legal definition." According to
the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Office on Women's
Health, sexual assault includes "rape
or attempted rape" and "touch-
ing your body or making you touch
someone else's." So I would like
to know why exactly thigh grop-
ing, kissing and attempted removal
of clothing don't qualify as sexual
assault, because, to my knowledge,
all of the above actions certainly fall
under the category of sexual assault.
And anyway, I don't really give
a shit about their legal definition of
sexual assault. I want to know if I
shouldn't take a cab because there's
someone - potentially multiple
people - in Ann Arbor molesting
women in cabs. Isn't that the duty of
the police department: to inform and
protect its citizens? I'm not going to
scan the news every day for reports
on sexual assault or any crime for
that matter; that's what the crime
alerts are for. The University Police
Department needs to stop getting
caughtinthe inconsistentlyenforced
legal stipulations of sexual assault,
and inform us when crimes occur
that pose a threat tothe studentbody.

Academic reform has been a major focus
for Parikh. Some of his main accomplish-
ments under this platform include a "flipped
semester," where students can work on an
independent project without having to drop
out of school, in addition to an active entre-
preneurship program that gives students the
resources to start their own business. These
changes, however, only affect a small portion
of the student body. While aspiring entrepre-
neurs may appreciate this opportunity, CSG
should advocate bringing entrepreneurship
into every classroom.
Another huge accomplishment for CSG
this year is the international student initia-
tive. CSG created the International Students
Society, an organization that helps acclimate
international students to life in America - the
first of its kind for foreign students at Michi-
gan. They've done a fantastic job actively sup-
porting the Coalition for Tuition Equality, an
organization that lobbies the University to
give undocumented Michigan residents in-
state tuition rates. But true change requires
more than Facebook likes. Groups like CTE

and ISS have the potential to tangibly change
the lives of many students, and they will ben-
efit from the continued support and leader-
ship of future CSG leaders.
While all these initiatives prove helpful for
a select group of students entrepreneurs and
international students make up only a small
percentage of Michigan's student body. The
student body of Michigan is large, complex and
spread out; CSG should think of ways to bring
students together beyond the handful of Foot-
ball Saturdays, perhapsthroughconcerts.Addi-
tionally, while 'luxuries' like a 24-hour caf6 are
nice, CSG should expand their focus beyond the
occasionally inconsequential aspects of student
life. What could CSG accomplish if it put all it's
effort toward improving minority retention or
student socio-economic diversity?
Parikh and this year's CSG members have
shown that the organization has the potential
to live up to its promises. It's up to next year's
leaders to make this a reality. Hopefully, poten-
tial candidates forthe CSG presidential election
realize the wide-reaching effects this role has
on students.

The 47th annual Super Bowl took place in
New Orleans, La., on Feb. 3 between the Bal-
timore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers.
During the fourth quarter, nearly 108 mil-
lion people tuned into CBS to watch as the
Ravens claimed a slim victory over the 49ers
with a final score of 34-31. Baltimore was
announced the winners as players flooded the
field in celebration. CBS cameras followed
Ravens quarterback and game MVP Joe Flac-
co as he rejoiced with his teammates. "This is
fucking awesome," shouted Flacco. CBS, not
expecting the foul language, failed to censor
the "f-bomb" in time. Almost as soon as CBS
let Flacco's swear word slip through to view-
ers, the Parents Television Council filed a
complaint against the network to the Federal
Communications Commission.
In 2004, the PTC's complaint against
Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction dur-
ing the half time show led the FCC to fine
CBS $550,000. Though the penalty was later
appealed, some small damage to the network
had occurred. The PTC's newest complaint
calls forth issues regarding levels of appro-
priateness on prime-time television. Why are
Americans so harshly criticizing a network
and potentially an MVP football player for
one simple word that slipped out ina moment
of excitement? How is one explicit expression
so horrifying for children to hear compared
with the overly sexualized and stereotypical
idea portrayed in Super Bowl commercials?
The PTC and FCC need to reorganize
their priorities. Americans' acceptance of
Beyonce's scant outfit during the half time
show highlights a growing problem. Imag-
es of sexuality and violence are far more
impactful than an overzealous expression of
joy. It's quite likely that many viewers didn't
even notice Flacco's mishap, tuning out as
the game ended. Even if a viewer was lucky
enough to remain entranced by the television

to catch the horrid "f-bomb," the audio clip
lasted mere seconds. Meanwhile, children
and adults alike were bombarded throughout
the football game by worse in advertisements.
GoDaddy's 2013 Super Bowl commercial
exemplifies American's double conscious-
ness in regards to the media. For 50 seconds,
GoDaddy plays on customary American roles
to reinforce gender stereotypes. The compa-
ny portrays themselves as having a sexy side
- represented by super model Bar Refaeli -
and a smart side that "creates a killer website
for your small business," represented by the
nerdy actor Jesse Heiman. "Together, they're
perfect," claims GoDaddy. Refaeli and Hei-
man then proceed to make-out as the camera
zooms in on their mouths for an excruciating
30 seconds. This advertisement perpetuates
the stereotypical notions that women must
be sexualized trophies and that only men can
be smart and create a "killer website for your
small business."
The ideas insinuated by the GoDaddy com-
mercial, and other sexualized Super Bowl
advertisements, are more harmful to the
minds of children than hearing the word
"fuck." And yet, the PTC hasn't filed a com-
plaint to the FCC concerning any of the pro-
vocative commercials. America's obsession
with vulgar language has blinded the Parents
Television Council from the actual villain -
harmful portrayals of stereotypical gender
norms. Media regulators need to pay more
attention to harmful programs and com-
mercials rather than obsessing over every
single explicative that slips out of an athlete's
mouth. By attacking overly sexualized con-
tent and stereotypically prejudiced program-
ming, the FCC and other organizations can
begin on the right track to actually bettering
American media.

et's be honest: The job mar-
ket can be a scary place for
college students these days.
Right now,
we're living in a
bubble, mostly
shielded from
the harsh reali-
ties of life after Y
graduation. But
as soon as we
take off our caps MICHAEL
and gowns, we'll
be faced with SPAETH
an economy still
recovering from
recession and unsettling anecdotes
of college graduates living in their
parents' basements for years trying
to pay off student loan debt. That's
the conventional wisdom, anyway.
Luckily, reality isn't as depress-
ing as the conventional wisdom
suggests. There's no question that
we will face many challenges after
graduation, but we should feel opti-
mistic for two reasons.
First, numerous studies have
shown that college graduates make
more money and have a lower
unemployment rate than people
without a college degree. The lat-
est job numbers reflect this trend;
The U.S. Department of Labor
found that college graduates faced
a 3.7 percent unemployment rate
in January. About half the number
of unemployed people had no more
than a high school diploma.
Second, our university is teach-
ing us many of the skills we will
need to be successful in the modern
economy. Right now, we're living in
a "knowledge economy," in which a
"global focus, the skills of critical
thinking and problem solving, com-
munication skills, teamwork skills
(and) technology skills" are impor-
tant, according to Constance Cook,
executive director of the Universi-
ty's Center for Research on Learn-
ing and Teaching.
Cook said that LSA is doing a
good job of teaching the skills that
are necessary to succeed in the

knowledge economy. For example,
the college is "helping students
learn to do critical thinking and
problem solving," which are par-
ticularly important components of
a liberal arts education. Also, there
is "an increasing focus on active
learning and engaged, immersive
experiences for students" such as
study abroad and internship oppor-
tunities as well as undergraduate
research opportunities through
UROP. LSA has many learning
communities to help students
develop "teamwork and collabora-
tion skills," and some LSA faculty
members are trying to "build tech-
nology into their classes so that
students are using technology for
their learning."
Unfortunately, the liberal arts
have been pushed to the sidelines
in recent years as politicians and
policymakers have pushed for a
greater emphasis on science, tech-
nology, engineering and math skills
and careers, often called STEM. For
example, in his State of the Union
address last week, President Barack
Obama announced that "we'll
reward schools that... create classes
that focus on science, technology,
engineering and math, the skills
today's employers are looking for to
fill the jobs that are there right now
and will be there in the future."
It's true that there is a large role
for STEM jobs to play in the modern
economy and for teaching the skills
to be qualified for those jobs. How-
ever, while STEM jobs are highly
sought after right now in the wake
of the recession, we need to think
beyond the present moment. Unlike
skills taught in humanities classes,
for example, STEN skills may be
"easily computerized and tradable"
in the future, Daniel Jelski, a chem-
istry professor at State University of
New York at New, wrote in an article
for New Geography.
"I'm really sad about the lack of
public understanding of the value
of a liberal arts education, including
the humanities and social sciences,"

Cook said. "This incredible consum-
er focus and recession-related job
focus of students and their parents I
think is skewing our education sys-
tem away from the humanities and
social sciences, and that's at a time
when countries like China are mov-
ing toward the liberal arts because
they see that innovation and creativ-
ity are very important."
There's still value to
be found in a liberal
arts education.

LSA is not the only college at
Michigan that is helping to prepare
students for the knowledge econo-
my. The School of Engineering, for
example, is working on teaching
"teamwork" and "communication
skills" in its courses, and is "put-
ting a lot of effort into study-abroad
opportunities and entrepreneur-
ial opportunities for students,"
according to Cook. Additionally, the
School of Art and Design website
states that all of its students must
complete some kind of "internation-
al travel and study" experience.
The bottom line is that if we take
advantage of the opportunities
at our university that relate most
closely to our interests and career
goals, we will be prepared to suc-
ceed in the knowledge economy. We
also should make sure that everyone
understands the value of a liberal
arts education in preparing us for
our participation in the knowledge
economy, especially at a time when
the status quo says otherwise.
Yes, the economy is still strug-
gling, but life after graduation isn't
quite as ominous as it sometimes
seems.

efforts will shift to South Quad.
SOUTH QUAD TO BECOME
CENTER OF CENTRAL
CAMPUS DINING
The renovations for South
Quad residence hall will be simi-
lar to East Quad's, with a focus
on the dining experience. South
Quad will also have a Latin sta-
tion, an Asian micro-restaurant,
a grill and a smoker. It may also
include an all-day breakfast area.
Linda Newman, the director
of University Housing, said the
Residential Life Initiatives pro-
gram - which oversees the Resi-
dence Hall renovations - aims
not only to institute infrastruc-
tural upgrades within campus life
facilities, but also to improve their
environments for the sake of the
student experience.
However, Newman South
Quad's renovations will not be
extensive as the recent renova-
tions done to other buildings.
"South Quad is primarily a
dining renovation," Newman
said. "The principle work is on
the first and lower level. We are
not doing the extent of infra-
structure as we have the other
renovations, but we will be redo-
ing the bathrooms on all the resi-
dential floors."

undergraduate degree like a
BBA and go into a very well-
paying position without need-
ing an MBA," Jackson said. "A
lot of that depends on wheth-
er or not you happen to be at
the right place at the right
time."
She added that master's
programs are a great way to
make a "career transition"
from one industry to anoth-
er.
Rackham student Leslie
Rott said graduate programs
are "heterogeneous," with
people of all different ages and
various level of experience in
the job market. Her reasons
for not taking a gap year after
her bachelor's degree to pur-
sue a graduate-level education
was the right choice for her,
she saw merit in doing other-
wise.
"Graduate school is a very
long process, so I think it
makes sense to take some
time off. But it just depends
on where you are in your life,"
Rott said.
Rott said it's also common
that Ph.D. students who realize
that they are not fit for doctor-
ates choose to take the masters-
degree track instead.
"I think that, regardless of
what you want to end up doing,

Quad will become the hub of Cen-
tral Campus dining, Logan said.
"What willhappenwith diningis
reallythecreationofaCentralCam-
pus dining center," Logan said. "It
will be far more different than what
people associate with South Quad
now, and the micro-restaurant con-
cept is going to be taken to an even
more extensive level"
"It's actually going to be an
exciting change in terms of the
dining experience for not just
South Quad residents, but resi-
dents throughout Central Cam-
pus," Logan added.
The centralized aspect of the
dining hall would be similar to
that of the Hill Dining Center, the
main dining hall for all residents
in dorms on the Hill.
The new dining hall will seat
about 950 people, up from its cur-
rent capacity of about 600. The
Hill Dining Center seats 675.
Construction of South Quad is
set for this summer and will be
completed by the 2014 and 2015
school year.
WEST QUAD NEXT
FOR RENOVATIONS
At the Board of Regents meet-
ing on Thursday, University
Housing officials will also pro-
pose renovations for West Quad
residence hall that would begin in
summer 2014.
A major change proposed for
West Quad is the elimination of
the dining hall and kitchen space,
which would then be repurposed
into a variety of study spaces.
West Quad residents would
instead go to the newly construct-
ed South Quad dining hall for
their dining needs.
Another large task for the West
Quad renovations is addressing
in a Ph.D. program you have a
level of expertise and you have
proven that you can be com-
mitted to something," Rott
added. "I think that can be use-
ful regardless of what field you
want to go into."
At the same time, Rott
believes that master's students
have greater job flexibility due
to the nature of their curricu-
lum and the focus of their edu-
cation. Master's programs are
often accompanied with intern-
ships and field placements,
while Ph.D. students are taught
to market skills focused toward
academics.
"In a master's program you
have more freedom because you
can work for a job anywhere,"
Rott said. "With a Ph.D. there is
a level of expectation of the sort
of caliber job you are going to
get right away. "
62 percent of graduating
Ph.D. students from 2008 to
2012 went into university fac-
ulty and administrative posi-
tions or went on to complete
a post-doctoral fellowship,
according to the Rackham
website.
Twenty-three percent of
graduating Ph.D. students dur-
ing this time period went into
industry or non-profit posi-
tions. Jackson said this num-
ber will likely increase over the
years.
"There is a real need to create
career programming for those
Ph.D. students who are going
into industry positions," Jack-

problems with its layout, New-
man said.
"What we're hoping to accom-
plish is the complete infrastruc-
ture renovations," Newman said.
"We're hopefully going to be able
to address some of the navigation
issues around West Quad."
West Quad renovations would
complement some of the changes
at South Quad, such as an align-
ment of the entrances of the two
residence halls. South Quad will
only have one entrance on the east
side of building, compared with
its current two-entrance layout.
"The goals of the program
were to ensure that we had state-
of-the-art life safety programs,
to upgrade the infrastructure in
heritage facilities, to modernize
our dining facilities across cam-
pus, to introduce different styles
of living arrangements and to
design facilities that allow for bet-
ter connectionnbetween living and
learning," Newman said.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said physical
renovations to the residence
halls are long overdue.
"Essentially this is all part of
a multiple-year plan to revital-
ize and improve the living expe-
rience for Michigan students,"
Logan said. "Major changes to
the buildings have been deferred
for many, many years and now
we're catching up with that to
add another several generations
of life to buildings that are vital
to the campus experience."
Assessments and studies about
housing needs began in the 1990s,
but the momentum for major
renovations picked up when Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man recognized residential living
improvements as one of her top
four priorities in 2002.
son said.
As graduate programs prove
to be a transition between for-
malized education and jobs,
in-school work experience
proves to be crucial for students
enrolled in graduate programs.
Jackson, as a part of her mas-
ter's program, was placed in
an internship at the University
Medical School. Such intern-
ships help solidify career goals,
she said.
"While you're getting the
theoretical aspect of the edu-
cation in the classroom, you
are also balancing that with
the practical experience you're
getting the in the field," Jack-
son noted. "I think that is the
strength of the program and
that was what helped me figure
out my career target."
For doctoral candidates at
the University; work experience
often comes in the form of being
graduate student instructors
or graduate student research
assistants.
Rott's current experience as a
GSI made her realize that such
work-study positions not only
help "spread the knowledge
gained in grad school" but also
realize whether or not Univer-
sity teaching is a feasible career
option.
"I think you learn how to
get up in front of people and
be comfortable talking, which
is something that you have in
potentially any job," Rott said.
"You know the resources that
universities have to offer."

and that there was both real
and perceived stigma, which I
am sure adds to the many bar-
riers that students feel when
they are contemplating wheth-
er they should get help," she
said.
The numbers had increased
across the board since apoll con-
ducted in 2008, which surprised
Carbone.
Judith Banker, founder of
the Center for Eating Disor-
ders, also collaborated on the
construction of the survey and
said the results were relatively
consistent with her expecta-
tions.
"To some extent, we weren't
surprised because eating dis-
orders are a common problem
among young adults," Banker
said. "However, the largest
growing demographic strug-

gling with eating disorders is
men in the Business school,
which is relatively unexpect-
ed."
A current hypothesis involves
a correlation between the com-
petitive nature of students at the
University, which can predis-
pose a person to have tendencies
consistent with an eating disor-
der.
Banker said they plan to sur-
vey students at Michigan State
University sometime this year
and then compile the findings
into presentations intended for
campuses and clinics across the
country.
"These are only preliminary
findings right now, so we have to
conduct the survey several more
times before we can say anything
for sure," she said.
Though the survey revealed
that students are often reluctant
to seek help or discuss their bat-
tleswithbodyimagewith others,
there was no shortage of aware-

ness among students about their
prevalence.
LSA freshman Molly Potel
immediately said the numbers
didn't surprise her, because
eating disorders "are a college
thing."
"I feel like in college, every-
one's meeting new people -
especially living in the dorms
- and I feel like people think
they need to look their best and
are willing to do anything to do
that," Potel said.
Another main facet of the sur-
vey was the perceived availabil-
ity of healthy food on campus,
which Potel feels is largely an
issue for students working lateat
night.
"During the day, there's
healthy food in the dining halls
and places like that," Potel said.
"But when it gets really late at
night, you're looking for places
open late and ones that deliver,
and those tend not to be the
healthiest."

money." Shortly after camp
began, his uncle . murdered
his aunt and then killed him-
self. To make matters worse,
his girlfriend was stabbed to
death outside of a roller rink in
Detroit.
This combination of trag-
edies further depressed Taylor
and he ended up homeless in
Detroit struggling with alco-
holism. He served two and a
half years in federal prison
after being charged with hav-
ing prior knowledge of a bank
robbery.
Michigan coach Bo Schem-
bechler helped Taylor earn a
master's degree from the Uni-
versity before he was released
from prison in 1977.
While still homeless in 1997,
Taylor said faith inspired him
to turn his life around. In May
2003, he earned his Doctor of
Education degree from the Uni-
versity of Nevada, Las Vegas.
In 2009 he opened a residen-
tial substance abuse treatment

facility in Detroit.
"This August 17 will be 16
years since I had a drink, drug
or cigarette." Taylor said.
Taylor tied his life experi-
ence to the theme of the con-
ference, and told attendees and
upcoming leaders how impor-
tant the connections and deci-
sions they make now are for
their futures.
The conference then split
up into small groups of 10 to
15 people to have more focused
discussions. Topics of conver-
sation included strategies for
resume writing, how to deal
with conflict in the workplace
and how to apply leadership
skills throughout the many fac-
ets of life.
One presentation given by
Amir Baghdadchi, the Univer-
sity Housing's assistant direc-
tor of communications, titled
"How to Sell Out: Shameless
Corporate Advertising and
the Art of Gaining an Unfair
Advantage," related product
ads to ways in which job appli-
cants should advertise them-
selves in their applications.
Baghdadchi cautioned job-

seekers that there's always
someone more qualified for any
given job, but there are always
ways to beat out the competi-
tion.
He suggested focusing on
a single strength rather than
listing a myriad of talents and
experiences.
"Resumes with more bul-
lets than have been fired in any
war" are not necessarily the
most effective in capturing an
employer's attention, Baghdad-
chi said.
LSA junior Tyler Mesman
said he attended the conference
in order to prepare for his job as
a residential adviser next year.
"I wanted to apply leader-
ship skills to my job as an RA
and my work in student govern-
ment," Mesman said.
Engineering freshman Aus-
tin Hamilton attended for simi-
lar reasons. He is also amember
of Stockwell Residence Hall's
program board, which spon-
sored the event.
"This is different than any
leadership conference (I've
been to), which I love," Hamil-
ton said.

shit," they said. and Rave
They were right.
And now 20th Century Fox
I'm down $30
for dragging them to a movie that
had me convinced that low expec-
tations could be shattered. Who
cares if the trailer dragged us
through a graveyard of unoriginal,
shoddily edited action sequences?
Did it really matter no one had any
idea what the film was going to
be about? of course not. This was
"Die Hard," dammit - random
stuffs were going to spontaneously
combust and the only thing tying
it all together would be virile one-
liners spat out of Bruce Willis's
("Moonrise Kingdom") smirking
mouth.
But "A Good Day to Die Hard"
is not in the same category as

those fist pump-inducing shots
of testosterone we used to watch
when Willis had hair. Weird and
unnecessary, this fifth installment
sputters along like an old jalopy. It
limps through an amalgamation
of scenes that reek of the alcohol
some writer in Hollywood (Skip
Woods, "The A-Team") drank and
then regurgitated on the script
when trying to come up with idiot-
ic references to the most idealized
version of manliness imaginable.
Apparently, real men are inca-
pable of hugging (biceps too big)
and laugh after getting impaled by
large, blunt nails.
But let's be fair - you're sup-
posed to leave your brain at home
when watching an overblown
action extravaganza like this,
right? Whoever came up with the
plot (Stop hiding - we know it was
you, Skip) certainly thought so.
We start off with John
McClane's estranged son, Jack (Jai
Courtney, "Jack Reacher"), killing
someone in Russia. The murder
prompts our hero to hop on the
next flight to Moscow in an attempt
to finally come to terms with his
son's apparent delinquency. As it
turns out, Jack works for the CIA
and McClane's unannounced visit
throws off his mission to escort
a Russian whistleblower to the
United States. Father and son
eventually join forces, and the
jalopy wheezes to a start. Throw
in a couple senseless plot twists, a
few barrels of weapons-grade ura-

nium and the most moronic, car-
rot-chewing (why, Skip, why?), tap
dancing Russian villain (Radivoje
Bukvic, "Taken") ever conceived,
and you've got yourself 97 minutes
of my life on Valentine's Day, 2013.
Like a lot of other teenaged
males, I don't necessarily mind
when some assholes try to ped-
dle this exclusive brand of hare-
brained idiocy as long as there are
at least a few well-choreographed
scenes of flaming carnage. In this
film, there are no such scenes.
There's flame, there's carnage,
but it does nothing more than slap
you with a migraine. Every single
action sequence is over-long, drag-
ging to the point that the sound of
metal grinding against pavement
actually starts to become part of
the background noise. Seriously,
we don't need to hear every little
engine spurt as John McClane
clumsily tries to figure out how to
get his car off the side of a bridge.
And by the time it finally does,
it becomes clear I'll never watch
another "Die Hard" sequel
again. John McClane used to be
an iconic character, but like with
any action hero worth knowing,
he got old. The time's come to
move on. So here's my goodbye:
Throughout the film, our not so
battered protagonist frequent-
ly yells out, "I'm on vacation."
John, I love you, man, but you're
not on vacation anymore. You're
retired - you just haven't real-
ized it yet.

in this bland and Rave
Nicholas Sparks
big-screen adap- Relativity
tation. It's an
agonizing, sadis-
tic way to spend a date.
A woman, whose real name is
Erin Tierney (Julianne Hough,
"Rock of Ages"), arrives in South-
port, N.C., hoping to escape her
past. The good people of the town
welcome her into their lives,
including, and especially, widower
Alex (Josh Duhamel, "Movie 43"),
with whom she falls in love. Unfor-
tunately, Erin's history threatens
to quash their blossoming relation-
ship.
Despite a story full of conflict,
Hough does little to provoke any
empathy from the audience. An
emotional core is nowhere to be
found in Hough's performance.
She strives for a girl-next-door
vibe, but the attempt amounts to
the unconvincing, reprehensible
charm of a pretty little liar. The
same could be said of Duhamel. As
a father, however, he conveys (to a
small extent) a sense of despera-
tion: The frustrated gentleness
with which he asks his son to be in

a picture with him almost makes
himbelievable, even likeable.
Unfortunately, the nice-guy-
meets-a-nice-girl part of his char-
acter is gag-worthy. It's the same
"you hang up first" joke you see on
sitcoms all too often, but without
the self-aware irony - just lovers
tryingto be cutesy, clueless to how
annoying they are. In short, "Safe
Haven" has but a quantum of suc-
cess in portraying giddy youth.
There's more life to Ken and Bar-
bie than this cloying melodrama.
That said, the fault mostly lies
with its superficial script, which
substitutes believable charac-
ter development for half-baked
emotional depth. Erin suffered
through an alcoholic, abusive rela-
tionship; Alex loses his childhood
sweetheart, but their problems
are hardly given their due respect.
While "Safe Haven" isn't meant to
be commentary butjustsomething
fun, the ankle-deep character
writingnonetheless fails to engage
its audience. And the dialogue: so
tacky and stilted, one wishes "Safe
Haven" were a silent film instead.
Near the movie's finale, Jo (Cobie
Smulders, TV's "How I Met Your
Mother"), Erin's best friend in
Southport, proclaims the day sim-
ply "incandescent." Who the hell
says that?
The story's emotional shal-
lowness is made still worse by its
cock-eyed plot twists. A super-
natural element is tossed into the
mix to little effect, except for the
presumable purpose of sewing up
the plot's loose ends. By doing so,
the tremendous suffering of both
characters is trivialized, robbed

of its trauma - whose full weight
is, again, terribly absent in the
first place. The result of the cheap
addition of supernaturalism? A
complete lack of authenticity. The
plot twists are inane, their stupid-
ity exceeding excusability; "Safe
Haven" is offensively stupid.
Barbie and Ken
have more life.
Nothing yet has been men-
tioned of the stock music riddled
throughout the film or the severe
incompetence of editor Andrew
Mondshein ("The Odd Life of Tim-
othy Green") and director Lasse
Hallstrfm's ("Salmon Fishing in
the Yemen"). For there are great
romance movies out there. Take
"Amour," recently released in the
Michigan Theater, or even "Silver
Linings Playbook." Watch some-
thing that'll make you laugh and
cry, not slap yourself via facepalm.
The worst thing a film can do is
make you feel like it wasted your
time. It'd be wrong to say "Safe
Haven" did that. No, it damn near
brings your pulse to a syrupy stop
with boredom. It drawls with the
urgencyofafilibuster, allbutwast-
ing its (and your) time. More time
is spent convincing us how cute
Alex and Erin are together than
crafting a story built on genuine
people of genuine problems. It's an
insufferable experience.Youmight
as well stay home and munch on
stale bread. _

cinematic authenticity to bloom

ourselves.

Have you ever sent
that text - you know
exactly the one I'm
talking about - at 2 a.m. on
a Thursday night, and woken
up the next
morning,
bleary-eyed
and full
of full-on
regret?
Yeah, you
have.
But it's
OK! Chances ANNA
are the per- SADOVSKAYA
son you text-
ed has sent
the same message before, and
they're definitely not spread-
ing that text around to all their
friends, laughing at your impec-
cable spelling and grammar.
What's the protocol for these
situations? What are you even
supposed to say - should you
send an apology text, pretend
that you didn't even mean to
send it in the first place; it was
a mistake, a message sent to the
wrong person? Or do you forget
it ever happened, and move on
with your life until the next 2
a.m. run in with your contact
list?
Texting is strangely dramatic
for a form of communication
that is as removed as it gets. Sit-
ting at a safe distance (or maybe
not-so-safe. I'm looking at you,
across-the-table texters), you
have time to craft an eloquent,
appropriate response to what-
ever message you received. But
for whatever reason, as soon as
a text pops up from someone
vaguely important, it's like a
storm of insecurity takes grip.
"What do I say? Is this weird?
How long do I wait?" Time after
time, girls and guys alike freak
out over ambiguously phrased
messages, trying to decode the
meaning behind them - and
this is at the core of texting-
induced stress: inability to
properly communicate feelings.
Sloppy middle-of-the-night
texts aside, the textually active
world faces multiple commu-
nication problems. Trying to
be sarcastic? No one will get it.
Want to sound aloof? It's going
to sound angry. What's the
point of taking 15 minutes to
create a beautiful, well-worded
reply if the intended affect
won't take hold of the recipient?
That's why the world created
emojis.
Rather, that's why Apple-pro-
duced emojis popped up on the
iOS 5, and now life is easier.

Emojis, the term for picture
characters used in Japanese
electronic messages, are sym-
bols that depict emotion. No
longer do you have to stare at
your iPhone screen, deciding
what to send to the horrible "K"
text.
On second thought, don't
send anything back. That
doesn't dignify a response.
The large amount of emojis
available allows texters a whole
new world of expression. Fusing
pictures with words creates an
easier way to express emotion
and gives people on the receiv-
ing end a clearer understanding
of the message's intended emo-
tion.
For example: Answering
with an "I don't know" can be a
turnoff for the receiver. What if
what you really mean is "STOP
TEXTING ME, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU, YOU EVIL
TROLL."
That 'K' text
doesn't even
deserve an
answer.
It has happened before.
But sending "I don't know"
with a helpless face attached
changes the entire mood. Sud-
denly, you're thrust into the
boat of indecision together.
You two have to figure out how
to stay afloat - it's a bonding
experience.
They're fun. They're useful.
They come in handy when you
have absolutely nothing else to
say, and you want to continue
the conversation. You can cre-
ate entire masterpieces with
them.
Incorporating art into tex-
ting is another way the arts
invade everyday life - emojis,
the fine arts aspect of texting,
are responsible for artistic
representations of hilarious
scenarios, all delivered via
texting.
Next time you want to send
a horribly awkward message,
do it with the help of emojis.
Maybe things will end up going
better than expected.

The Strokes still searching'All
the Time' for their sound

By KATIE STEEN
Daily Music Editor
A few weeks ago, Strokes fans
were left with the equivalent of
an unexpected text from a still-
loved ex from high school: news
that a Seattle radio station appar-
ently had a new Strokes single
that - allegedly - was to deliv-
er the "classic Strokes sound"
we've craved for nearly a decade.
Fans wanted to believe that it
was true, but if we've learned
anything after the 2011 release
ofAngles, it's that the Strokes are
going to do what they want to do,
and all we can do is wait around
for some inkling of Is This It.
In late January, we were given
"One Way Trigger," a synthy,
falsetto-filled track that led to
some people praising the return
of the Strokes, while others
questioned if it was genuinely a
Strokes song (new game: drink
whenever someone comments
"WTF????" on the Soundcloud
stream). But "All the Time," the
band's second single, entirely
lacks the neon leg warmers
and side ponytails of "One Way
Trigger," leaving listeners with
somewhat incompatible pieces
of evidence as to what to expect
from the band's March 26 album,
Comedown Machine.
The song starts off inoffen-
sively, guitars warming up while
Julian Casablancas's vocals glide
over the track at an octave we're
used to, assuring listeners that he
hasn't changed a bit. But as "clas-
sic" as the start of "All the Time"
might sound, it doesn't have that
instant appeal, the lighthearted
seduction with which so many
Strokes songs have enticed us
time after time. Instead, "All
the Time"
leaves us First seen on

Strokes fans can be a bit of an

"All the Time" is not something
that would have ever been con-
sidered for Is This It, or perhaps
any of the band's old stuff. It
almost sounds like they're sell-

the Strokes to aspire to return
to the cheeseburger-consuming,
cigarette-smoking, mischief-
making days of American rock
that made the masses swoon in
the early aughts, but that would
require that they actually put
some heart into their music and
have some fun together - not
just as a band, but as friends.

Where are the
Recession movies?

'Killing Them
Softly' only recent
film to reflect reality
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
I got a problem with movies
today: Where's the recession?
Often when we want to bet-
ter understand the past, we look
to that time's popular culture,
and that includes movies. In this
way, movies are a way of remem-
bering. If you were to look at
only what films were made in
our time, you might assume the
biggest financial catastrophe
since the Depression is behind
us. Everything is OK. And, if
we're not careful, that's how
the federal bailouts, the anxiety,
the fear, Occupy and the great
recession might be remembered
- a dip in the financial timeline.
That's how we might be remem-
bered. Is that truly how you feel?
2009's "Up in the Air" took
you into the life of someone
who fires workers for a living,
but that film was more about
the alienation symptomatic of
a system whose capital is bod-
ies. That said, "Up in the Air"
eloquently opened up the pos-
sible dialogue on livelihood. But
I want to know about the blue-
collar workers Clooney fired. I
want to know what our story-
tellers think about the deep-
seated uncertainty, confusion
and anger we felt as a nation the
day our parents lost their pen-
sions. Where's the angst?
There's only one film to my
memory that has summed up the
fear of blue-collar people - and
it was a mafia flick that swung
with the heavyweight strength
of a champion but barely blipped
on pop culture's radar. That
movie was "Killing Them Soft-
ly," and indeed, it went softly;
it crept into and out of theaters,
tip-toeing.
I'm here to freshen the bruis-
es it left.
A neo-noir crime thriller,
"Softly" was not a subtle film; it
was spiked-bat politics. Deliv-
ered cruelly, cynically, with all

the delicate graces of a cactus.
The meditative nuance that's
normally preferable was substi-
tuted for open brutality - the
bleeding of workers manifested
in the vicious violence of the
Mob. Crooks get away. The inno-
cent get shot. The shrewd and
cut-throat survive. You gotta be
hardened, desensitized to the
economic bloodletting. And it's
always going to keep happening
this way without the "Hope" and
"Change" we should believe in.
Though imperfect and obviously
heavy-handed, which may have
lost it critical steam, I've yet to
see another film brandish its
teeth as bracingly as it had.
But "Softly" was no block-
buster wonder. I have a sus-
picion that Hollywood has
recession screenplays laying
around they're too afraid to
finance: The resulting product
will just be too damn boring and
too damn sad. We were lucky
to get "Softly," which worked
because of its shameless black
humor and hard-hitting allegory
on capitalism, whose violence
made the precarious economic
condition of the blue-collar
worker all the more visceral. It's
damn dangerous not being rich.
You see, I hate that dull,
hammer-headed argument some
tunnel-visioned nincompoop
makes after watching a movie,
"It's not supposed to mean any-
thing." Somehow, the person
saying that there's meaning
in film is turned into a nut for
chasing after ghosts no one else
believes.
Whether or not you watched it
for one reason or another, films
are always meaningful in that
they reveal culture. They don't
have to leave us a moral, they
don't have to preach, they don't
have to go on a diatribe to mean
anything because, invariably,
they normalize a reality. And
the real reality is often inad-
vertently glamourized; often, it
is changed. When false images
and stereotypes are popularized
and consequently collectivized,
they're often mistaken for being
true, and whatever problems
plague our society go unnoticed.
Think of what conflicts can

labor a time period: Depending
on what piece of popular culture
you're examining, and when it
was made, Native Americans
are either brutal savages intent
on murdering every white they
see, or they're tragic heroes. The
1950s are either a time of nostal-
gia and innocence or brutal con-
formity. You either party like it's
the 1980s or you blow up like it's
the 1980s. Now, take the Facebook
Generation: Interconnectedness
or isolation; Pitbull music video or
"Killing Them Softly."
To be clear, I have no problem
with using film for escapism. The
problem is balance. The dichoto-
mies I've introduced in the previ-
ous paragraph could be true, but
for very different groups of peo-
ple. With the incredible opulence
overwhelming our popular cul-
ture, you'd think looking back on
our time that every motherfucker
in America was born with a caviar
spoon up their ass. "The Social
Network" (the real 2010 best pic-
ture) had it right with Justin Tim-
berlake's character: "A million
dollars isn'tcool. Youknowwhat's
cool?A billion dollars."
My point is we should democ-
ratize our popular culture, for
democracy isn't just about gov-
ernment. As an Asian Ameri-
can, I may have all the papers
that say I'm you and you're me,
but that didn't settle the "other"
question. I had to fight (and am
still fighting) to be you. That's
the challenge the working folks
in this country got to overcome.
When we settle the Asian ques-
tion, the Latino/a, the Black,
the Gay, the Muslim, the work-
ing class question, we will settle
the American question. For that
to happen, our culture needs
to change. We don't need the
trendy; we need the truthful.
For our time to be told truth-
fully, we need films that are
truthful and will garner atten-
tion - that will earn remem-
brance. Let us normalize what's
normal, make reality what is
reality. We must negotiate the
hard and cruel with nuance. We
must navigate reality with the
artful. I'm calling for a democ-
racy to this "post"-recession
culture.

"Glee" has gotten desperate
- or at least Ryan Murphy has.
Gone are the days when "Glee"
possessed intriguing plotlines
and engaging characters. Now all
that's left is a hot mess.
Before all the die-hard "Gleeks"
start lighting their torches and
sharpening their pitchforks,
know that I don't hate the show.
Some redeeming qualities still lie
beneath the gimmicks, but lately
you have to dig pretty deep to find
them.
One question that I find myself
asking every episode is: Why are
all the old characters still hang-
ing around McKinley? Murphy
decided that, unlike other TV
shows in the genre, he wanted
to keep his show realistic, so he
forced half his cast to "graduate."
Yet at least one of those McKinley
graduates manage to make it back
each week, despite the fact that
they allmoved far away fromlittle
Lima, Ohio.
But, then, I watch a few pain-
ful scenes with the newest cast
members and I understand why
the old characters pop up so often.
It's not that the new characters
are bad; they're just boring, and
I feel nothing for them. Murphy
had no motivation to create new
characters, so, instead, he opted
to make all of his new cast mem-
bers into less dynamic versions of
past ones.
I can'tbetheonlyonewhofinds
it incredibly ironic that Murphy
was so concerned about realism
when he decided that each season
be an individual school year. Now,
realism has been thrown out the
window, run over by a bus and
then set on fire, just to bring back
the old cast members.
In fact, in this new reality
Murphy has created, "You don't
need to go to college, you can just
go to L.A., or New York, and be a
star." And if you do go to college,

you rarely need to show up; feel in the Christmas episode, "Glee,
free to travel around the country Actually," that Kurt's dad (Mike

classes will clearly take care of Why has that never been brought

guard Trey Burke's outstanding
day and several cheer-inducing
alley-oops by freshman forward
Glenn Robinson III, they didn't
play like they had much to cel-
ebrate. But Michigan pulled out
the win, 79-71, over Penn State.
"It was ddja vu of the Nebras-
ka game," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "Nebraska came in
here and we had some adversity
in the game and we had to battle
through it. We had to do some
things that, frankly, we needed
at this time. Last week was such
a difficult week for us (so) to try
to bounce back, we needed to win
any way possible."
Added Burke: "I told the guys
this is a gritty, not pretty type
of win. It wasn't the best type of
win, but it was a win we needed
to come out with. We'll get better
from it, it gives us a level of confi-
dence we've been missing."

The Wolverines were down by
as many as eight points in the first
half, and the first field goal made
by someone other than Burke
came with eight minutes left to
play in the half. Burke had five of
Michigan's nine total field goals
in the first stanza and the sopho-
more finished with a season-high
29 points and five assists on 9-of-
16 shooting.
Though Burke hit his shots and
dictated Michigan's offense in
the first half, he still had trouble
finding open looks. Penn State's
defense forced Burke to take off-
balance fade-away jump shots
that Penn State coach Pat Cham-
bers called "circus shots" - shots
that reflected the Wolverines'
inability to get into offensive

Robinson breaks out of
scoring slump in a big way

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Editor
With six minutes remaining
in the first half of the Michigan
men's basketball team's matchup
against Penn State on Satur-
day, Glenn Robinson III darted
across the baseline and rose up
to corral a lob from sophomore
guard Trey Burke. With ball in
hand, Robinson reacquainted
himself with an old
friend on the flight
down: the rim. A
But that wasn't
the only highlight
from the fresh-
man forward on
Sunday. Robinson
- who had been strug-
. win,,.,

of late to produce on the offensive
end, brought life into the crowd
with an aggression that hadn't
been seen out of him in weeks,
throwing down a season-high
five dunks en route to a 21-point,
10-rebound performance in
Michigan's 79-71 victory.
"I think my first (field goal)
was the (alley-oop) from Trey
and that got the place going,"
Robinson said. "We started
to play defense, get our hands
together and (started) playing
more as a team. (Those dunks)
definitely got me going."
Entering the contest, the Wol-
verines' opponents had ren-
dered Robinson ineffective
on offense during the past
two weeks. He'd been held
under double-digit points
in three of the past
four games and hadn't
reached his scoring or
rebounding averages

upon himself,

Glenn Robin-
son III liad two against Michigan
State, then again against Indi-
ana; Tim Hardaway Jr. had two
against Michigan State; and the
bigs, well, the bigs barely tip the
scales on offense.
But the unflinching, unfalter-
ing Burke hasn't failed. It's just
not in his repertoire, I suppose.
Michigan survived a scare
against Penn State on Sunday,
thanks in large partto a season-
high 29 points from Burke.
Burke, Robinson and Stauskas
combined for 68 of the Wolver-
ines' 79 points. The three big men
- Jordan Morgan, Jon Horford
and Mitch McGary - shot a com-
bined 0-for-5 for zero points.
Remember, that came against
the unquestioned worst team in
the Big Ten - winless-in-the-
conference, winless-in-the-new-
year Penn State.
That's not how that Michi-
gan gameplan was written up;
Michigan was supposed to mop
the Crisler Center floor with the
Nittany Lions. But Burke had to
bail Michigan out from a monu-
mental upset. Somehow, despite
the embarrassment of riches sur-
rounding him, that's still Burke's

job.
Burke is the king of the court
at Crisler, and it's scary to think
where this team would be with-
out him.
Trey Burke was packed and
out the door. He was done.
On Thursday, April 4 last
spring, Burke was headed home
for Easter weekend, and he didn't
plan on coming back. He cleaned
his dorm room, said goodbye
to roommate Max Bielfeldt and
walked out to the curb outside
West Quad.
"When I stepped in the car,
I was leaning gone," Burke told
ESPN. "I was leaning toward
leaving."
But then, with both feet out
the door, a conversation with
his parents on the three-hour
drive to Columbus changed
everything. Burke decided to
return for his sophomore season
at Michigan, turning down the
fame and fortune of the NBA for
one more year.
His decision changed the
entire complexion of this Michi-
gan team. He returned as the
capstone of Michigan coach John
Beilein's emerging program, a
program thatbadly needed a
floor general after losing star
guard Darius Morris to the NBA
Draft a year earlier.
It's hard to assess where this
team would be without Burke.
Top 10? Top 20? Maybe. You'd
like to think so, but it's no guar-
antee the Wolverines would even
be ranked if they were starting
a true freshman or a little-used
veteran at point guard. Burke's
poise and big-game experience

being a household name, Burke
hasn't looked to prove himself a
scorer, he's looked to create. And
he learned true consistency, even
in the eye of the Big Ten hurri-
cane. And that mindset has him
rocketing upward in both the
scoring and assists categories in
the Michigan record books.
But while having one con-
sistent player might be enough
against Penn State, it isn't against
Michigan State and Ohio State
and Indiana. That takes four or
five serious contributors, with
no major lapses or collapses.
The Michigan coachingstaff
is grooming its freshmen to be
everyday-consistent players
like Burke, but it's nota quick
journey. And it very well might
not happen quickly enough to
salvage the Wolverines' quest for
a Big Ten title.
In front of Morris and other
former Michigan greats on Sat-
urday, Burke proved his mettle
once again against Penn State,
scoring 29 points - his highest
40-minute total at Michigan -
five assists and zero turnovers.
It was his fourth turnover-less
game of the season, a pleasant
stat to go with his 3.7 assist-to-
turnover ratio. He is the only
member of the Michigan roster
that has scored in double figures
every game this season.
That's consistency. That's a
guy you can trust. If he needs
to score, he'll score. If he needs
to pass, he'll pass. If he needs to
lead, he'll lead. He's the king of

offense would be stalled and for-
gotten. The 3-point machine that
was Michigan basketball under
Beilein would still be installed
out of necessity.
Fortunately, Burke is here, and
the hypothetical nightmares are
simply that - unreality.
Michigan invited any and all
past kings of the court back to
Crisler for the weekend: from
Cazzie Russell to Phil Hubbard,
Glen Rice, Zack Novak and even
Darius Morris.

As much as they gawked at the
new arena, many of the former
players came for the coronation.
They came toget an in-person
look at the kid in the white No. 3
jersey emblazoned with a now-
familiar name: Burke.
The expectations were far
different for Burke this second
time around. As a freshman,
Burke was a national surprise,
an under-the-radar recruit that
switched his commitment from
Penn State to Michigan and
caught fire. He returned asa
fixture on everyone's radar. He
returned this fall to the center of
the college basketball universe,

a preseason All-American at the
helm of one of the most-hyped
teams in the country.
And he'll admit that, some-
how, somewhere along the line,
his focus shifted away from his
future, away from himself and
back to the team.
"Lastyear, I was kind of seek-
ing (the NBA dream)," Burke
told ESPN. "This year it is more
coming my way. It's more (that)
I'm able to focus more on Michi-
gan basketball and staying in the
moment. I was more immature
last year."
From year one to year two, he
didn't change, though. Despite

Three one-run
games and two
walkoff losses start
Bakich's tenure
By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball team
headed to Berkeley this weekend
to take on the California Golden
Bears in a three-game series, and
the out-
come was MICHIGAN 4
strangely CALIFORNIA 5
reminis-
cent of the MICHIGAN 5
previous CALIFORNIA 6
season -the
Wolverines MICHIGAN 1
were swept, CALIFORNIA 2
losing two_
games in extra innings and their
final game in the bottom of the
ninth.
The series began Friday after-
noon, when Michigan took the
early lead in the second inning
on an RBI from sophomore short-
stop Dylan Delaney. The Wolver-
ines picked up another run in the
third, but Cal answered quickly,
earning one run off of senior
pitcher Ben Ballantine and anoth=
er off his reliever, redshirt junior

Logan McAnallen. The score was
tied at two until senior captain
Patrick Biondi earned an RBI
off a double in the fourth, giving
Michigan the lead.
With the score at 5-4 in the
bottom of the ninth, sophomore
pitcher Trent Szkutnick allowed
a run to tie the game, sending
it into extra innings. California
came out with the win in the 11th
inning off an RBI from junior
Andrew Knapp. Szkutnick, who
had five strikeouts in the previous
three innings, was credited with
the loss.
Although the Wolverines
couldn't pull out a win, Michigan
coach Erik Bakich spoke highly of
Szkutnick's performance.
"He absolutely pounded the
strike zone and had great ener-
gy about him," Bakich said. "I
thought he pitched well enough
for us to close out the game and
win, but we just couldn't make it
happen."
Junior right fielder Michael
O'Neill, recently voted Big Ten
Preseason Player to Watch, went
3-for-4 in the second game with a
pair of doubles, a run scored and a
run batted in.
"We lost game one, but the ulti-
mate goal is to win the series and
we were still in a position to win
this series," O'Neill said.
Tied at one at the top of the

fourth, Michigan's offense
exploded, beginning with a solo
home run by freshman pitcher
Jacob Cronenworth - the first of
his career. Delaney reached first
on a throwing error and moved
to third ona Biondi single. O'Neill
hit his second double of the day to
send Delaney home, and an infield
single from freshman third base-
man Travis Maezes brought in
Biondi. O'Neill stole home on a
wild pitch to finish out the inning
with a 5-1 lead.
The Wolverines' momentum
started to dissipate, though. In
the bottom of the fifth, sopho-
more pitcher James Bourque let
up a two-run home run by Knapp
to cut the lead to two.
The game was tied 5-5 at the
end of nine and once again, the
game headed into extra innings.
This time, the Golden Bears shut
Michigan down right away - they
didn't allow a single Wolverine hit
in the toth, and scored off an RBI
to end the game, 6-5.
"Coach basically said we were
playing not to lose instead of
extending the lead," O'Neill said.
"If you get a hit here and a hit
there, a 5-1 lead can turn into an
8-1 lead and then the game is out
of reach."
On Sunday, the team's offense
was visibly deflated, but fresh-
man pitcher Evan Hill had a ter-

rific performance on the mound
in his collegiate debut. He pitched
seven innings, allowing only one
run and four hits by California's
strong lineup.
"I thought he showed the pitch
ability, the confidence and the
presence of an upperclassmen,"
Bakich said. "He did everything
we could have wanted him to do
and put our team in a position to
get a 'W.'"1
His performance wasn't
enough to propel the team to
victory, though. Hill allowed his
only run in the sixth inning, and
the Wolverines held the lead at
one until the eighth inning when
Michigan tied the game off a dou-
ble by Biondi.
It looked as if the game would
go to extra innings once again,
but California loaded the bases
in the bottom of the ninth and
scored the winning run off an
RBI by freshman Brian Celsi,
sealing a 2-1 victory. The Golden
Bears had successfully swept the
Wolverines.
"We have to just put the game
away," Bakich said. "When you
lose three one-run games in
walk-off fashion, that's not easy
for anyone to swallow, but we are
going to solidify some roles in our
bullpen and this was a good learn-
ing experience for all of us as we
continue to grow and improve."

Part of Saturday's win can be

the meet in Columbus.
"I think there was a little

Golder said. "Before the meet,

In the end, Michigan's relent-

much for Ohio State, as Michi-
gan pulled off hit after hit on the
final three rotations in the meet.
The key for Michigan going
forward will be to get Miku-
lak going as he returns from a
leg injury. Having him at full
strength will solidify the lineup
and add more potency to the top
team in the nation.
"This team is one of the great

that with this team, but I like our
chances this year."
continued to follow the program
after they left. Rice said he sets
an alarm on his television so he
knows when Michigan is play-
ing and calls his support for the
team "an unconditional love,"
and Russell is pleased to see the
program playing at a champion-
ship level again.
Though Michigan has disso-
ciated itself with the Fab Five,
this weekend was an effort to
embrace other former teams to
create unity in the program. Rice
and Russell were elated to return
to Ann Arbor for this weekend's
events, and Rice appreciates the
effort Michigan is putting into
reuniting former players.
"As a former player, you want
to come back and do whatever
you can to support your pro-
gram," Rice said. "In the past,
that reach hasn't been there. One
thing Beilein is stressing to all of
us is we need to bring it back to
where it used to be, and he can't
do it by himself. He needs all of
us as a collective group, and now
it's up to us to give our time and
do the right thing."
offense."
The growth in Robinson's
confidence throughout the game
might have been best exhibited
by a sequence early in the second
half. Six minutes into the period,
the Wolverines were leading
46-40 and Robinson briefly woke
up the lifeless crowd with an
exciting two-minute span. Dur-
ing the stretch, Robinson threw
down two dunks and a three-
point play to score seven straight
points for Michigan.
"This game was huge for him,"
said freshman guard Nik Staus-
kas. "He's had a few games where
he hasn't played his best, so to
come out - I think he had 21 and
10 - that's a great game for him.
"He had a bunch of highlight
dunks and that's what we want
from him. We want him to get
easy baskets and dunks in tran-
sition. I know he's happy and I
know his confidence is definitely
going to get boosted from this
performance."

WEEKEND
From Page 1B
mance, Michigan (9-4 Big Ten,
22-4 overall) came out of the
locker room with a 6-0 run to
take a 38-32 lead. The Nittany
Lions (0-13, 8-17) clawed back
to tie the game at 38, but that
would be the last time the Nit-
tany Lions knotted the score.
The Wolverines continued to
make their run, pushing their
lead to as much as nine points
late in the second half, due to
the resurgence of two of their
keys to the offense - Robinson
and freshman guard Nik Staus-
kas.
Robinson scored a career-
high 21 points, 10 of which
came from dunks or alley-oops.
Though the freshman hasn't
displayed much confidence in
the Wolverines' games against
tougher opponents - Robin-
son totaled just 18 points in the
past four games - he seemed to
regain his swagger.
He was able to get more
involved in the offense in tran-
sition to get open for three
separate alley-oops. Another
time, he was found cutting hard
across the baseline for an easy
dunk. Robinson even grabbed
10 rebounds for a double-dou-
ble.
"(Robinson) did a great job
second-cutting, not just stand-
ing," Chambers said. "He had
five dunks, I'm sure. He did a
real good job of not standing
and getting himself to the bas-
ket. He ran the floor really well
(and) I felt like he cut pretty

well. He got a lot of easy shots,
and a lot of them were dunks
unfortunately for us."
Stauskas also found his
shooting touch again. Prior to
Sunday, the freshman guard
only shot 7-for-19 from 3-point
range and hadn't shown much
poise in getting to the rim.
But against the Nittany Lions,
Stauskas tallied 18 points and
hit a couple of key 3-pointers to
help maintain Michigan's lead
down the stretch.
The trio of Burke, Robinson
and Stauskas shot a combined
20-for-31 from the floor and
accounted for 68 of Michigan's
79 points. They were also more
aggressive driving to the basket
and drawing fouls. The Wol-
verines shot a total of 35 free
throws and were 27 of 35 from
the charity stripe.
"It's nice (to have Glenn and
Nik back contributing)," Burke
said. "It gives them that level
of confidence that they may
have been missing in the (past
few) games (when) they weren't
shooting the way that they
know they can shoot. It's their
job to hit it when they're open,
(and) I think the earlier we get
them involved, the earlier they
hit shots, get to the free throw
line, be a part of the offense, the
better they're going to play."
NOTE: During a first-half
timeout of Sunday's game, the
1989 NCAA Champions team
was honored as a part of the
"Return to Crisler" weekend.

seniors snap
losing streak

For first time
in five years,
Michigan beats the
Spartans
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
As Michigan women's bas-
ketball coach Kim Barnes Arico
strolled into her postgame
press conference on Saturday,
she couldn't control her excite-
ment. After senior forward Kate
Thompson wrapped up her inter-
view, the duo embraced in an
emotion-filled hug.
Thompson and her four other
senior teammates did something
on Saturday that the Wolverines
(8-4 Big Ten, 19-6 overall) had not
accomplished since Jan. 13, 2008
- beat Michigan State, 70-69.
It's been just that type of year
for this Michigan team, led by its
five seniors - Thompson, guard
Jenny Ryan, and forwards Rachel
Sheffer, Nya Jordan and Sam
Arnold.
After gaining entry into the
Associated Press Top-25 poll for
the first time in more than 10
years in early January following
a program-best start, the team
followed it up with a road victory
over then-No. 13 Purdue - the
Wolverines' first victory in West
Lafayette since 1998.
"This senior class, we say has
accomplished things that haven't
been accomplished for a Michi-
ganwomen's basketballteam ever
or not in a very long time," Barnes
Arico said. "One of things that
they weren't able to do in their
time here was to beat Michigan
State, so for them to be able to do
that in their last opportunity on a

day like today at our home place
was truly incredible and they
deserve that celebration. It's been
a longtime coming."
On Saturday, with the Crisler
Center's lower bowl filled to the
brim and a sellout crowd of 5,800
on hand, Michigan once again
rode its seniors to victory.
"(The crowd) was awesome,"
Thompson said. "They were loud.
They really got into it too, which
was huge. Every time we scored,
it felt like an eruption."
Thompson was key to the
repeating bursts of loudness
from the crowd. She contributed
20 points on 7-of-12 shooting,
including four 3-pointers.
The loudest outbreak of noise
from any of her shots came mid-
way through the first half as the
shot clock was winding down.
Thompson collected the ball
approximately 30 feet away from
the basket and heaved up aprayer.
Somehow, it went in.
While the crowd went into a
fury, Ryan kept her cool.
"When (Kate) hit that, I looked
at her and smiled," Ryan said. "It's
just one of the plays that you pray
that it goes in and when it does
you move onto the next one."
Such was how Ryan played on
Saturday, as she posted a career-
high 24 points while committing
zero turnovers. She also chipped
in eight rebounds, five assists and
four steals in her 39 minutes of
action.
Though it's common for Ryan
to distribute the ball, her scor-
ing and overall level of play was
something that this recent one-
sided rivalry seemed to bring out.
"To see Jenny Ryan do some of
the things she did that's unchar-
acteristic of her normal abilities, I
think on a day-in, day-out (basis),"
said Michigan State coach Suzy

Seniorguard Jenny Ryan impressed Michigan State coach Suzy Merchant, who noted Ryan's uncharacteristic scoring. Ryan scored a career-high 24 points Saturday.

Merchant. "She's more of a facili-
tator. She just wasn't going to
have it today. She just decided
that they were going to be a little
bit better."
Ryan exemplified this notion in
the final minutes of the game, hit-
ting two pairs of free throws that
ultimately proved tobe the decid-
ing points in the game.
It was only appropriate for the

Wolverines' captain to be respon-
sible for the final points in their
first win in 13 tries against the
Spartans (7-5,19-6).
"This was Jenny's moment,"
Thompson said.
As a group, the seniors com-
bined for 66 of the team's 70
points. Jordan had 12 points and7
rebounds, and Sheffer tacked on 8
points to go with 5 rebounds.

For ateam that's accomplished
so much, ithas held back in its cel-
ebrations in past games. But after
the game on Saturday, the energy
came bubblingout.
"Just the amount of energy,
and excitement, and pride when
I opened that locker room door,
it was an outburst," Barnes Arico
said.
The party didn't stop there,

either.
After her press conference,
Barnes Arico stepped away from
the podium, ready to leave the
room. But before she could exit,
she had to let out one last line - or
lyric if you know the Kool & the
Gang classic.
"Celebrate good times, come
on," she sang.
Celebrate, indeed.

A long-awaited victory

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Saturday's game was brought
to you by the number 12.
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team faced off against its
in-state rivals for the second time
in 12 days, and it was a game to
remember.
The 70-69 win was a season-
defining_
moment for MSU 69
the Wolver- MICHIGAN 70
ines, who
had previously lost 12 straight
games to Michigan State (7-5 Big
Ten, 19-6 overall).
"It was a sense of relief and a
kind of 'finally' moment," said
senior guard Jenny Ryan. "Michi-
gan State has such a good annual
program year and year, they just
turn out phenomenal teams.
"It is good for the program and
for the season as well. Any time
you can beat Michigan State it's
just a good feeling to say that you
won in the rivalry game."
Leading the way for Michigan
(8-4, 19-6) in the first half was
senior forward Kate Thomp-
son, who wears the number 12.
Thompson had 11 of the team's
first 15 points and ended the game
with 20. Thompson's highlight
of the game, however, came five-
and-a-half minutes into the game
when she drained an incredible
30-footshotto beat the shotclock.
Thompson is now second all-time
in Michigan history with 183
career 3-pointers.
"(Thompson's) confidence
level is at an all-time high," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "She's such a great scorer
and such a great shooter. I've seen
very few players that can shoot
the basketball like she can."
Behind Thompson's strong
start, the Wolverines started the
game off with a 17-8 run. But after
a timeout, the Spartans collected
themselves and wentcon a12-2 run
to take the lead, holding Michigan
scoreless for more than four-and-
a-half minutes.
After the Wolverines were able
to find the basket once again, they
grabbed a 26-25 lead with 3:45
remaining in the half, but Michi-

gan State fought back to take a
32-28 lead at halftime.
The Spartans outshot Michi-
gan 48 percent to 41 percent
from the floor in the first half.
Michigan State also shot 57 per-
cent from 3-point range, and both
teams had two players in double
digits in the first half.
If the first half belonged to
Thompson, the second half
belonged to Ryan, who scored
14 of her career-high 24 points
in the half. She also added eight
rebounds, five assists, and four
steals, while not registering a
turnover for the first time all year.
"I told (Ryan) before the game
she was going to have to score,"
Barnes Arico said. "But I (also)
thought she was great defensive-
ly, she beat her kid on the drib-
ble when she needed to, (and) I
thought she made big plays when
she needed to."
To open the second half, the
Wolverines scored four quick
points, but Michigan State wasn't
quiet for long, extending its lead
to six. After back-and-forth play
by both teams, a huge three-point
play by Ryan put the Wolverines
up 48-47 with 11:47 remaining in
the game. After a timeout by the
Spartans, Ryan came up with a
steal that resulted in another
huge three-point play, this time
by senior forward Sam Arnold.
Michigan's biggest lead since
early in the first half came after
Ryan hit a huge 3-pointer with
8:13 left putting the Wolverines
up 55-49. A timeout from the
Spartan bench slowed Michigan's
momentum, but not for long. A
three-point play by Thompson
followed by a 3-pointer from
senior center Rachel Sheffer put
the Wolverines up by nine.
Five fast points by Michigan
State, however, quieted the build-
ing and forced Barnes Arico to
call a timeout with 3:15 remain-
ing. The stoppage in play didn't
slow the Spartans' touch from
beyond the arc, and junior guard
Klarissa Bell cut the Wolverines'
lead to one.
After missed free throws from
both teams, Michigan held a one-
point lead into the final minute.
Senior forward Nya Jordan

hit a huge layup with 41 seconds
left, and two free throws by Ryan
put the Wolverines up by five, but
the Spartans hit a 3-pointer with
5.4 seconds remaining. After two
more free throws by Ryan, Michi-
gan State hit another 3-pointer
with no time remaining to fall one
point short.
"(Ryan) missed a couple of free
throws early, but downthe stretch
she made every one," said Barnes
Arico. "Sometimes kids let that
get in their head, but she was able
to get rid of that and really put the
game away down the stretch.
"She was incredible. I've
coached a lot of really good
point guards in my career as a
coach and she leads the pack just
because of everything she does.
She's the total package. She's a
coach's dream, really."
Michigan also found offense
from Jordan who added 12 points
and 7 rebounds.
The Spartans outrebounded
Michigan 32-27, but the Wolver-
ines were able to keep their turn-
overs to single digits for only the
fourth time this season. Michigan
improved its shooting from the
first half and shot 55 percent in
the second.
"Splitting (the series) in the
regular season just creates the
drama in March that you look
for," Ryan said. "If we meet them
again it will be interesting."
