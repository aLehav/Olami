President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

administration rescinded federal 
protections 
for 
transgender 

students at public schools and 
universities Wednesday night. 
Such protections, encouraged by 
former President Barack Obama, 
allowed transgender students to 
use the bathrooms of their gender 
identities.

The Obama administration 

issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to 
public schools and universities in 
April calling for gender identity to 
be protected under Title IX. The 
federal statute explicitly prohibits 
discrimination “on the basis of 
sex in education programs or 
activities operated by recipients of 
Federal financial assistance.” 

The University of Michigan 

complied 
with 
such 
orders. 

It currently provides several 
options for transgender students. 
Gender-inclusive 
housing, 

such as the Gender Inclusive 
Living 
Experience 
in 
East 

Quad “ensure(s) that University 
Housing is a supportive space for 
residents of all gender identities 
and 
gender 
expressions” 

according to the Housing website. 
Such housing includes private 
bathrooms or dorm rooms close 
to 
gender-inclusive 
bathroom 

facilities.

In 
May, 
LGBT 
Michigan 

President Emily Kaufman, an LSA 
junior and transgender woman, 
emphasized the importance of 
the Obama administration taking 

steps to protect transgender 
students, 
given 
the 
negative 

stereotypes they face.

She 
said 
the 
University 

administration could do more to 
protect transgender students.

“The University is one of the 

most liberal institutions in the 
country, so there aren’t really 
any problematic regulations that 
I’m aware of that exist anymore,” 
she said in May. “There’s more 
things that could be done to 
protect LGBT, particularly trans 
people, that the University could 
be doing.”

Kaufman said when she was 

a freshman — early on in her 
transition — she lived in Gender-
Inclusive Housing, but was not 
allowed to use the women’s 
restroom at East Quad Residence 
Hall because her gender marker 
was male. She said she would 
sometimes have to walk around 
the dorm to try to find a gender-
inclusive bathroom in which to 
shower. However, she was able 
to use the women’s bathroom 
elsewhere on campus. Since then, 
she said, things have changed.

In its first “Dear Colleague” 

letter 
dated 
Wednesday, 
the 

Trump administration revoked 
the Obama guidance, according 
to CNN.

The letter pointed to the need 

for more legal analysis of Title IX, 
which the Obama administration 
did not perform.

Additionally, a statement from 

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, 
also released Wednesday, said 
the Departments of Justice and 
Education withdrew the guidance 
on the grounds that it did not 
contain such analysis and that 

The University of Michigan 

administration 
has 
issued 

a 
formal 
response 
to 
the 

list 
of 
demands 
issued 
by 

Students4Justice Thursday. The 
group has previously organized 
multiple sit-ins, started a petition 
and proposed a list of demands 
calling for the administration to 
react.

The 35-page document went 

through each claim and demand 
that Students4Justice included 
in 
its 
list. 
Administrators 

discussed 
the 
University’s 

response to all the bias incidents 
that Students4Justice alleged 
they did not respond to.

According to an email sent 

by Robert Sellers, vice provost 
for equity and inclusion, to 
Islamophobia Working Group, 
the response letter sought to 
describe the existing action on 
campus and potential areas for 
additional action in four broad 
areas related to concerns raised 
by Students4Justice.

The 
administration 
is 

in the process of talking to

Abortion 
opponents 
have 

introduced three new pieces of 
legislation in aims of furthering 
their cause in the Michigan 
legislature.

The first bill, which has been 

introduced in both the State 
House and the Senate, would 
prevent the state government 
from having contracts with any 
agency that provides abortions. 
This bill would affect agencies like 
Planned Parenthood, the funding 
of which is already threatened by 
the possible defunding of former 
President Barack Obama’s health 
care law.

Federal, 
state 
and 
local 

government 
currently 
provide 

Planned Parenthood with over 40 
percent of its funding, though no 
federal government funding can go 
toward funding abortions because 
of an amendment passed in 1976.

Currently, the state contracts 

Planned Parenthood to provide 
various other health care services 
besides abortions. LSA junior Ella 
Webb, president of Students for 
Choice, said since government 
funding 
doesn’t 
go

The 
University’s 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion plan — a 
five-year effort to create a more 
diverse and inclusive campus — is 
comprised of 49 unique unit plans 
for this purpose, though does not 
include a provision that designates 
paid DEI positions within any 
of the University’s colleges or 
departments. 
This 
semester, 

University of Michigan graduate 
students have been taking action 
against carrying out diversity 
education and labor without 
compensation. However, many 
believe their plans are running 
into an administrative wall. 

Last December, the Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization, 
the 

labor union representing graduate 
student instructors and staff 
assistants, submitted a proposal 
to Academic Human Resources 
calling 
for 
unionized 
DEI 

positions for graduate students. 
The proposal was rejected this 
month.

In response, GEO launched an 

online petition, advocating for 
paid diversity labor in 19 colleges 
on campus, so students, faculty 
and staff will be better equipped 
to mold the University into an 
institution that values diversity 
labor. As of Wednesday evening, 
600 University affiliates have 
signed the petition.

GEO is currently bargaining for 

a new contract with the University, 
as its old agreement expires this 
May. University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
statement the University regards 
the request to create new DEI 
positions for graduate students 
to be inappropriate for the 
current 
contract 
negotiations, 

as the process only affects GEO 
members.

“The negotiations now under 

way are focused on the contract 
for the current membership of 
GEO, which is mostly GSIs who 
teach,” he wrote. “We are happy 
to discuss these types of positions, 
but it would need to be outside of 
the GEO contract talks.”

promote DEI on campus have 

GSIs seek 
payment for 
work on DEI
initiatives

Graduate students have been taking action
against unpaid diversity education labor

Funding remains a concern for middle-income students both in and out of state

LSA junior Joshua Rabotnick 

moved from Los Angeles in August 
2016 to attend the University of 
Michigan, but cannot afford the 
tuition bill without loans. 

LSA freshman Andrea Perez, 

an in-state student, is in the same 
situation 
as 
Rabotnick. 
Two 

families, both in the middle-class 
income level, struggle to pay for a 
degree from the University.

Despite a report from the Equality 

of Opportunity Project saying the 
median family income for a student 
at the University is $154,000, in 
the same report the University 
was ranked last in economic social 
mobility of 25 highly selective public 
universities.

With students facing debt after 

graduation and daunting social 
mobility statistics, students and 
University 
representatives 
are 

concerned middle-class families 
will have a hard time paying for a 
University education.

Back home, Rabotnick’s father 

used to own a successful business. 

However, during the 2008 economic 
recession, Rabotnick’s family lost 
the business and subsequently lost a 
large source of its consistent income. 
To regain future economic stability, 
his father opened nursing school the 
year Rabotnick transferred to the 
University.

“I transferred in as a junior,” 

Rabotnick said. “I now work as an 
EMT for the ambulance company 
out here, Huron Valley Ambulance, 
but because I worked so much 
throughout community college, the 
way it worked in 911 is we worked 
24-hour shifts and we could stack 

them, so I worked 48, 72 hours over 
a weekend, then be in school all 
week.”

Rabotnick 
made 
too 
much 

money while working in L.A. to 
be classified as a dependent on his 
parents’ tax forms. However, the 
Free Application for Federal Student 
Aid does not consider Rabotnick to 
be an independent student, rather 
the 
University 
then 
considers 

Rabotnick to be a dependent and 
takes his parents’ earnings into 
account when allocating financial 
aid.

The University of Michigan 

Department of Communication 
Studies announced via email 
to 
students 
last 
week 
that 

it 
will 
be 
making 
changes 

to 
its 
undergraduate 
major 

requirements, effective fall 2017.

Currently, students who wish 

to declare a communications 
studies major must complete 
Communications 101, 102, 121 
and 122 as prerequisite classes. 
Beginning next fall, only 101 
and 102 will be required for the 
major.

Communications 121 and 122 

— research methods classes — 
will still be offered during most 
semesters going forward, but will 
be considered 200-level classes 
and will no longer be required 
for the major.

Communications 
Prof. 

Kristen 
Harrison, 
the 

department’s associate chair for 
undergraduate studies, said the 
goal of the change is to make 
the major more accessible and 
tailored to students.

“Our 
curriculum 
was 
so 

bottom-heavy, meaning we had 
so many requirements at the 
lower end of the undergrad level, 
that undergrads were having 
trouble breaking into the major,” 
Harrison said.

Harrison stressed the change 

is meant to accommodate more 
students, rather than hurt those 
who have already completed 
the four prerequisites currently 
necessary for the major. Students 
who have already taken 121 and 
122 can keep the credits they 
earned, which will be transferred 
into elective credits.

“No matter who you are or 

what you’ve taken, you can use 

everything you’ve taken up until 
now and nothing will be lost,” 
Harrison said. “Whatever you’ve 
done, you can transition into the 
new (requirements) … We will let 
students apply 121 as if it were 
221, and then it will go towards 
the major electives.”

The major electives Harrison 

mentioned 
are 
another 

significant part of the changes. 
According to Harrison, feedback 
from graduating seniors and 
outside consultants suggested 
students wanted more upper-
level electives that allowed them 
to explore their specific interests 
further.

“We’ll probably create more 

courses at the 300-level, more 
topic-specific lectures … we 
used to have only a few of them, 
but now there’ll be much more 
choice with them,” Harrison 
said. “I think students will be 
thrilled with it. It gives them a 

lot more choice.”

Communications 
Prof. 

Scott Campbell, who is the 
most 
recent 
director 
of 

the 
departmental 
Honors 

program, is also enthusiastic 
about the effect these new 
changes will have on the 
department.

“I 
feel 
… 
optimistic,” 

Campbell said. “One of the 
things we’re trying to do is 
become a more diverse and 
inclusive 
program, 
and 
I 

think by loosening up the 
requirements, that’s one of the 
ways that will help us achieve 
that goal.”

Campbell said, while the 

changes have no direct effect 
on the Honors program, he 
hopes 
allowing 
students 

to take more topic-specific 
courses earlier on in their 
college careers will allow them 
to develop stronger interests 
and will drive more students 
to complete Honors theses.

Communications studies program 
changes prerequisites for majors

Two 100-level courses removed from required class list, will count for electives

MAYA GOLDMAN

Daily Staff Reporter 

LSA sophomore Sydni Williams 

was named the winner of the 

inaugural Global Citizen of the Year 

Award presented Wednesday by 

the Institute for the International 

Education of Students, an 

international nonprofit organization 

that connects colleges and 

universities, providing internships 

and study abroad programs to 

students in over 30 locations around 

the world.

According to a IES press release, 

the award is given to students who 

have “impacted their community 

abroad through academic, 

philanthropic or personal efforts,” 

and “will apply, or are applying, 

¬skills and knowledge they learned 

abroad to continually bring global 

perspectives to their communities.” 

Williams, a Spanish major, was 

specifically recognized for her work 

mentoring and tutoring low-income 

students in Madrid. The experience, 

she said, reminded her of similar 

problems in her hometown.

“My hometown, Detroit, is 

a place where many students go 

without the educational benefits 

that are awarded to the students 

in neighboring suburbs, where 

students aren’t provided adequate 

books to read, the water sometimes 

runs brown, and college seems to 

be an excellent place, but one that is 

unattainable for inner-city youth,” 

she said in the release. “I have 

made it my life goal to continuously 

contribute to my community by 

making sure that youth are not 

denied their right to an excellent 

education.”

During her semester abroad, 

Williams said, she saw many of the 

stereotypes low-income youth face in 

the world of education.

“The problem is not that they are 

incapable of learning, or that they 

don’t want to, but that the obstacles 

that they are faced with daily 

sometimes distract them from their 

education,” she said.

Williams hopes to take her 

career in a similar direction, saying 

she plans to start a nonprofit 

organization that will give a second 

chance to youth who have been 

convicted of criminal charges. She 

received a $1,000 cash prize as part 

of the award.

responded to a tense campus climate 
by advocating for change through 
protests and organizing resources. A 
number of inflammatory incidents 
have rocked campus this academic 
year, including multiple discoveries 
of 
posters 
promoting 
white 

supremacy and urging individuals to 
report undocumented immigrants 
in October and November and 
racist and anti-Semitic emailssent to 
engineering students and computer 
science students earlier this month.

Public Health student Jamie 

Tam, a GEO campaign committee 
specialist, argued the controversies 
made the University’s rejection of 
GEO’s proposal an even greater 
disappointment.

“For the University to say no to 

the proposal at a time when the 
groups that are under attack are 
the ones who are being asked to do 
this work for free, I think it’s unfair,” 
Tam said.

The DEI plan does require deans 

and department heads to report on 
diversity metrics and progress, and 
sets aside $85 million to carry out 
the plan over the next five years. As 
of yet, though, University president 
Mark Schlissel has designated Chief 
Diversity Officer Robert Sellers as 
the only senior administrator to 
focus solely on the plan. In accepting 
the position, Sellers referenced a 

network of “diversity professionals” 
that would facilitate departmental 
collaboration and best practices.

“I accept this position, but in no 

way does this fall on me alone,” he 
said at the DEI launch in October. “It 
takes a village to raise a plan.”

Other 
instructional 
positions 

dedicated 
to 
DEI 
education, 

including those of graduate students, 
were not included in the plan.

Rackham 
student 
Teona 

Williams, a supporter of GEO’s 
petition, led a day-long training on 
activism last Saturday, along with 
Students of Color of Rackham, 
Rackham Student Government and 
Students4Justice. Williams aimed 
to provide the campus community 
with resources to advance social 
and environmental justice in light of 
the election. According to Williams, 
being a proponent of the DEI wasn’t 
much of a choice.

“Someone once told me that just 

because I’m Black doesn’t mean I 
have to advocate for DEI,” she said. 
“But to me, as at the only Black 
student who matriculated in my 
department that year, I did.”

Tam said she, along with other 

graduate students, are tired of 
bearing the burden of diversity labor 
without compensation.

“There is a social inequality on 

this campus in that communities that 
are most affected by climate issues 
are asked to do most of the work to 
address those issues,” Tam said.

GEO President John Ware, a 

Rackham student, said the 49 unit 
plans established by the DEI plan 
have not been effective, as the plans, 
their implementations and their 
resource allocations vary widely 
across departments and colleges. 
Tam agreed and said the reason 
some unit plans are less robust is 
because there aren’t paid DEI staff 
to ensure work is seen through.

“Faculty and staff who get asked 

to do DEI work weren’t hired to do 
DEI work,” Tam said. “Students 
who are asked to do this give up 
time that could go towards their 
own academic progress in order to 
further diversity.”

Williams said the DEI plan fails 

to include strategies to respond to 
hate on campus.

“As we saw from the wave of 

racist attacks against people of color, 
there was nothing in the plans that 
could counteract that,” Williams 
said. “I feel very strongly that if you 
have paid DEI positions, then you 
will have people who have time to 
strategize beyond writing letters 
of solidarity that do not protect 
students from violence.”

Along with GEO’s proposal for 

DEI positions in February, GEO 
submitted 
13 
other 
proposals, 

including expanded health benefits 
for 
transgender 
individuals, 

expanded parental leave and added 
protections 
against 
academic 

retaliation. Some of the proposals 
were 
accepted 
under 
certain 

conditions during the bargaining 

meeting on Feb. 20, but the majority 
of the proposals, including the 
one for paid DEI positions, were 
not open to bargaining. To Ware, 
the University’s unwillingness to 
discuss funding for DEI labor is 
sending a clear message.

“Whatever 
the 
University’s 

intention may be, the clear message 
it sends by refusing to bargain on 
diversity work is that it reserves the 
right to underpay the people doing 
that work or to deny them the benefits 
and workplace protections that come 
standard for other graduate student 
employees,” Ware said.

The petition is still gaining 

signatures. GEO has collaborated 
with Students of Color at Rackham, 
Rackham 
Student 
Government 

and the Multicultural Leadership 
Council, and is receiving support 
from 
undergraduate 
students, 

faculty and staff. Tam said the issue 
of supporting the proposal is simple 
and that it all comes down to the 
answer of one question.

“Is it fair to ask members of 

predominantly minority groups to 
do this work and not compensate 
them for it?” she asked.

Despite its initial delay, the 

University is gradually signaling its 
willingness to accommodate the 
proposal.

“I believe a meeting — outside 

of contract talks — is being set up 
to pursue this idea for the week 
following spring break,” Fitzgerald 
wrote.

Perez moved to Michigan before 

starting eighth grade, qualifying 
her for in-state tuition. Despite the 
difference between average in-state 
cost of attendance of $28,776 and the 
average out-of-state lower-division 
cost of attendance of $59,784, Perez 
still struggles to pay for school like 
Rabotnick. Perez’s father is an 
engineer, but her mother stays at 
home, and she has two siblings.

In an February interview with 

The Michigan Daily, E. Royster 
Harper, 
the 
University’s 
vice 

president for student life, said 
a large population of students 
reside in the middle-class area of 
distribution and are often ignored 
by financial aid.

“We want to keep (tuition costs) 

down, because if you are high 
income, you’re not worried about 
it,” she said. “If you’re low income, 
you’re not worried about it. It’s a lot 
of kids in the middle, so it’s a real 
problem, but it isn’t a problem for 
the students for whom we don’t 
have many.” 

Because 
Rabotnick’s 
family 

made too much money last year to 
be considered for larger amounts 
of financial aid though currently 
does not make enough to help pay 
for school, Rabotnick said he had to 
take out student loans to make up 
for this lack of sizeable financial aid.

“I think that a majority of the 

student base struggles financially 
through school and lives off of 
student 
loans 
through 
school 

knowing that one day things will 
be easier, things will be better,” he 
said. “That’s really the boat that I’m 
in. I take student loans, essentially, 
for food every day.”

Perez is in the same situation as 

Rabotnick, reportedly receiving 
about $10,000 in financial aid but 
having to take out about $5,000 in 

student loans.

“I definitely think there’s a 

problem, because my dad, he’s an 
engineer and he makes … a decent 
salary, but 30 grand a year (for 
school) on top of a five-person 
family on top of a mortgage and 
stuff like that, it’s definitely not 
enough for my family to be well 
off while I’m at school, and also 
my brother is going to school next 
year, maybe here,” Perez said. “If 
he is coming here, that would be 60 
grand, which is more than half of 
what my dad gets paid a year.”

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald addressed Rabotnick’s 
student debt in an email and stated 
student debt has decreased over 
the past four years. According to 
University data from Fitzgerald, 
48 percent of in-state graduates in 
2015-16 left the University with no 
debt. For those that did take out 
loans, the average was $23,438, 
which is down from the 2011-12 
average of $25,798. 

For out-of-state students like 

Rabotnick, average student debt 
in 2015-16 was $28,931, a decrease 
from $34,418 in 2011-12.

“One reason for the decrease 

in student loans, is that U-M has 
been replacing loans with grants in 
financial aid packages,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “Grants do not need to be 
repaid.”

Rabotnick said he has met with 

the Office of Financial Aid many 
times to try to explain his situation 
beyond what the figures and tax 
forms show on paper. Each time, 
he was directed toward FAFSA 
policies and other resources.

He also attempted to establish 

residency in Michigan, but could 
not. The University Office of the 
Registrar 
residency 
guidelines 

require out-of-state students to 
submit an Application for Resident 
Classification if they have lived 
or worked outside of the state of 
Michigan in the past three years. 

Rabotnick needs to prove he is 
a permanent legal resident of 
Michigan, and because he has lived 
and worked outside of the state in 
the last three years, this is difficult 
to do. 

Rabotnick 
said 
the 

administration should take into 
account his tax independence 
and his permanent address when 
looking at his case for in-state 
tuition or increased financial aid. 
He said as a public institution, the 
University wants more out-of-state 
students for their tuition dollars.

“I 
love 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan while I’m far from loving 
the administration,” he said. “I 
don’t think the two necessarily go 
hand-in-hand. I’m happy I’m here 
… I love getting the education that 
I’m getting here but the feeling 
I’ve gotten from dealing with the 
administration is a bureaucracy 
which only cares about making 
money at the expense of students.”

Perez, 
Rabotnick 
and 

Engineering 
freshman 
Malika 

Takale all mentioned how much a 
degree from the University means 
to them, but its low ranking in 
terms of socio-economic mobility 
concerns them.

Takale, 
an 
in-state, 
upper-

middle-class student, said she was 
surprised that more students did 
not move up in income values with 
a degree from the University.

“(The report) is really surprising 

to me because everyone gives a 
Michigan degree so much praise 
and 
especially 
because, 
even 

though Michigan is a public 
university, it’s just as expensive for 
out-of-state kids as an Ivy League 
school would be,” she said. “I would 
expect kids to make more money 
with a degree from Michigan after 
they graduate.”

Rabotnick, while acknowledging 

the ranking as an issue, said the 
data isn’t surprising because many 
students come to the University 

with a lot of money already.

“Based off the statistic … with 

the median income being roughly 
$150,000, you’re only going to 
move so much from that point as 
a professional,” he said. “Unless 
you’re going into some big specialty 
in medicine or law, I don’t think 
there would be much deviation. I 
do think that people who are lower 
class have the ability to move up.”

In 
a 
previous 
interview, 

Fitzgerald 
referenced 
other 

statistics from the Equality of 
Opportunity Project’s report and 
its graphical summaries in The 
New York Times’ The Upshot. 
According to the data, Michigan 
was ranked third out of the 
same 25 highly selective public 
universities in terms of students 
with the highest-paying jobs after 
graduation. The median student 
income at 34 was $68,700.

“That underscores what some 

other 
reports, 
including 
the 

Department of Education’s college 
scorecard, said about being a good 
value, a good investment, because 
it pays off,” he said. “The median 
salary for our graduates following 
graduation, some reports show as 
much as $25,000 higher than the 
national average.”

Perez said the main goal of 

college shouldn’t be to make a lot 
of money after graduation. She also 
said she believed the University 
should be more proactive in making 
sure students are competitive in 
the workforce after obtaining their 
degrees.

“You shouldn’t necessarily go 

to school to get paid,” she said. 
“But also, if you’re coming to a 
university that’s claiming to be 
different speakers and claiming 
to give you opportunities that 
other universities can’t give you, 
then they should assure that their 
students are better off than other 
university students when they go 
out and get jobs.”

abortions, this bill is only taking 
away crucial health services that 
are often much more expensive 
elsewhere.

“The biggest target of this 

bill 
is 
obviously 
Planned 

Parenthood, 
which 
receives 

significant 
government 

funding,” Webb said. “However, 
it’s crucial to note that public 
funding 
cannot 
go 
towards 

abortions, which has been the 
case for decades.”

Even though federal funding 

cannot currently go toward 
abortions, this new legislation 
would prevent any funding from 
going to agencies that provide 
abortions, even if they provide 
other services. In addition to 
the erasure of health services 
other than abortions, Webb said 
limiting access to safe abortion 
clinics 
won’t 
do 
what 
the 

sponsors of the bill intend to do: 
limit abortions.

“Extensive 
research 
has 

shown that efforts to reduce 

abortion through government 
regulations 
is 
ineffective; 

abortions 
will 
happen 

regardless, it’s simply a matter 
of how safe and accessible they 
are,” Webb said. “If politicians 
truly want to promote a ‘pro-life’ 
agenda and reduce the number 
of abortions, they should work 
to promote services that help 
reduce unintended pregnancy, 
such as better sexual health 
education and access to birth 
control — exactly the services 
Planned Parenthood provides.”

State Sen. Patrick Colbeck 

(R–Canton), one of the sponsors 
of the bill, said on the Senate 
floor that pro-choice groups are 
also promoting agendas that 
differ from their title.

“We have a culture right now 

that is unfortunately so pro-
death,” Colbeck said, “They do 
it under the mask of choice. It’s 
really not a choice. That kid does 
not have that choice.”

LSA senior Rachel Crawford, 

president of Students for Life, 
pushed back against claims this 
bill is for furthering a political 
agenda, considering the moral 

debate surrounding abortions.

“This isn’t a consideration 

of personal preference, but a 
deeply held moral stance for 
many people,” Crawford said. “If 
the state contracts with agencies 
that supply abortion among their 
other services, then they are 
committing a conscience rights 
violation 
for 
those 
morally 

opposed to abortion.”

Additionally, 
Crawford 

said the absence of clinics 
that provide abortions doesn’t 
necessarily mean there will be 
an absence of quality, accessible 
health care if the government 
directs funding efficiently.

“The state government should 

contract with agencies which 
provide healthcare to women 
and do not have abortion as a 
service, like Federally Qualified 
Health Centers,” Crawford said. 
“FQHCs are also not vulnerable 
to the economic problem of 
fungibility, which is the main 
concern for taxpayers opposed 
to funding agencies that also 
provide abortions.”

State Rep. Steve Johnson 

(R–Wayland), another one of 

the bill’s sponsors, agreed with 
Crawford and said there are 
solutions that would prevent 
health 
care 
services 
from 

becoming unattainable.

“There 
are 
many 
other 

organizations 
that 
provide 

services for women’s health,” 
Johnson 
said. 
“If 
Planned 

Parenthood wishes to receive 
funding, it’s very simple: stop 
doing abortions.”

The second bill would allow 

the 
Michigan 
Secretary 
of 

State to carry “Choose Life” 
fundraising license plates. This 
bill has been introduced despite 
legislation that denies the state 
the ability to offer politically 
linked plates and despite the 
fact that a similar bill was 
introduced last year and never 
received a vote. Webb said in 
addition to being inappropriate 
for the government to facilitate 
“Choose Life,” the plates are 
politically charged in many 
facets.

such measures should be enacted 
at the local level.

“The 
prior 
guidance 

documents 
did 
not 
contain 

sufficient 
legal 
analysis 
or 

explain how the interpretation 
was 
consistent 
with 
the 

language of Title IX,” Sessions’ 
statement 
read. 
“Congress, 

state 
legislatures, 
and 
local 

governments are in a position 
to adopt appropriate policies 
or laws addressing this issue. 
The 
Department 
of 
Justice 

remains committed to the proper 
interpretation and enforcement 
of Title IX and to its protections 
for all students, including LGBTQ 
students, from discrimination, 
bullying, and harassment.” 

Nevertheless, 
the 
general 

consensus is the new guidance 
will not have a direct impact on 
University policies.

In an email to the Daily, 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
is 
committed 
to 
fostering 

an inclusive community. He 
directly cited the University’s 
non-discrimination 
statement 

from Human Resources, adding 
emphasis — shown bolded — to 
related topics. 

“The University of Michigan, 

as 
an 
equal 
opportunity/

affirmative 
action 
employer, 

complies with all applicable 
federal 
and 
state 
laws 

regarding 
nondiscrimination 

and affirmative action,” the 
statement reads. “The University 
of Michigan is committed to 
a policy of equal opportunity 
for all persons and does not 
discriminate on the basis of 
race, 
color, 
national 
origin, 

age, marital status, sex, sexual 
orientation, 
gender 
identity, 

gender 
expression, 
disability, 

religion, 
height, 
weight, 
or 

veteran status in employment, 
educational 
programs 
and 

activities, and admissions.”

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–

Ann Arbor) said hopefully the 
University will not be impacted. 
He pointed to the State Board of 
Education, which released a set 

of guidelines in September that 
explicitly allow students to use 
the bathrooms of their gender 
identities, in addition to other 
recommendations.

However, he said the new 

guidance would still have a 
significant impact on the nation.

“The effect that this will 

have is that it sends a chilling 
signal to the entire country 
that the age of respecting civil 
liberties is over and the new 
Trump administration wants to 
tear our people’s civil liberties 
and reintroduce discriminatory 
practices into the everyday, in 
this country,” he said.

According to CNN, Secretary 

of 
Education 
Betsy 
DeVos 

initially opposed Trump’s plans 
to rescind the gender identity 
protections. However, a source 
told CNN she was told to agree 
to the plans, which she did on 
Wednesday.

Rabhi said he thinks the 

release of this guidance is a 
direct threat from Trump, which 
he anticipates will be a repeated 
action in the next four years.

“I think this was another 

example of Trump himself sort of 
calling the shots over the people 
he appointed to his very Cabinet, 
and look, if DeVos didn’t like this, 
then she should have stopped 
it,” he said. “I think she had a 
greater role to play in this than 
she led everybody to believe. But 
of course we saw the heavy hand 
of Trump coming down and 
pushing for this.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair 

of the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, wrote in an 
email to the Daily it is not fair for 
people who are not transgender 
to evaluate how an action like 
this 
can 
affect 
transgender 

people.

“Those of us who are not trans 

must listen when these folks 
say that policies like this make 
them unsafe — we must support 
people of all gender identities 
and gender expressions, and all 
those who are marginalized by 
discriminatory policy,” he wrote.

student organizations to try to 
find specific actions that will 
help to mitigate the damage of 
these attacks to the University 
community. 

“We are concerned that we have 

not done a good job of publicizing 
all that is going on at the University 
with respect to the specific 
concerns about our climate that 
Students4Justice and others have 
raised,” Sellers wrote.

Additionally, the letter was 

written to make the University’s 
stance on the aforementioned 
demands clear in light of an article 
written by CollegeFix which, 
according to the University, cited 
many inaccuracies in the current 
discussions taking place.

Within its list of demands, 

Students4Justice 
requested 
an 

increase in Black representation on 
campus equal to 10 percent, and for 
the administration to make efforts 
to increase enrollment numbers of 
other minority students.

The 
response 
from 

administration informed readers 
of the available resources on 
campus and the six outreach and 
recruitment initiatives currently 
in place. In addition, the University 
cited a 6.9 percent increase in 
underrepresented students in the 
freshman class this year from last 
year.

The letter also included a 

request for the University to 
declare solidarity with students 
of color by addressing “current 
events regarding police brutality” 
and renaming University buildings 
to 
“reflect 
and 
acknowledge 

student activism on campus and 
additionally 
acknowledge 
the 

legacies of oppression that the 
people the buildings are currently 
named after have caused.”

University 
spokesperson, 

Rick Fitzgerald, emphasized in 
an email to the Daily that the 
University has ongoing iniatives 
to address the concerns raised by 
Students4Justice. 

Students4Justice 
did 
not 

respond immediately to request for 
comment.

B

lack History Month, for 
me, is by far the most 
meaningful 
month 
of 

the year. A time to reflect on the 
triumphs, tragedies and teachable 
moments of the past, while 
celebrating the influential people, 
institutions and events of today. It 
is also a time to look to the future 
and imagine a society greater 
than the one we currently inhabit. 
Since 
President 
Gerald 
Ford 

commissioned February as Black 
History Month in 1976 as a part of 
the United States’s bicentennial, 
students in schools all over the 
country have read books on the 
civil rights movement, written 
reports on some of our most 
remembered pioneers and seen 
such programs as the biographic 
cartoon “Our Friend, Martin.”

Today, the entire month of 

February is Black History Month. 
However, prior to 1976, just the 
second week of the month was 
known as Negro History Week. 
It was established in 1926 by 
prominent Black historian Carter 
G. Woodson and others within 
the Association for the Study 
of African American Life and 
History, an organization Woodson 
co-founded. ASALH thought the 
many contributions of African 
Americans to our society, both past 
and present, should be remembered 
and celebrated. I concur.

I personally feel a certain 

affirmation of my own existence, 
and of my ancestors, during the 
month of February. Living in a 
country that does not always value 
Black lives, I find it somewhat 
heartening that people will at 
least pretend to for these 28 
days. Every year the president 
will issue a proclamation on the 
first day of February, declaring it 
Black History Month. Television 
stations will run documentaries, 
radio show hosts will interview 
historians 
and 
experts, 
and 

politicians will selectively quote 
activists. For this one month, it is 
not controversial to be Black.

Black 
History 
Month 
is 

not without its critics. There 
has always been a chorus of 
uninformed bigots repeating the 
line: “Why isn’t there a white 
history month?” This inquiry is 
extremely problematic, and in 
my opinion, not at all genuine. 
The history of this nation has 
been 
whitewashed 
for 
the 

appeasement of the masses. We 

celebrate Christopher Columbus, 
Thomas Jefferson and Ulysses 
Grant for their contributions to 
the advancement of exploration, 
the establishment of individual 
liberties and the reunification of 
our nation, but we often forget 
the enslaved Black Europeans 
and Americans who helped 
them succeed.

Black history is being made — 

by our leaders — right before our 
eyes. It was monumental for us to 
see the United States’s first Black 
chief executive take the oath of 
office eight years ago, and former 
President Barack Obama’s name 
is guaranteed to grace the pages 
of textbooks for centuries to come. 
However, after his election had 
been contextualized as being 
within a political climate that 
was “post-racial,” it was just as 
monumental 
when 
then-First 

Lady Michelle Obama noted that 
she wakes up “every morning in 
a house that was built by slaves” 
during her Democratic National 
Convention speech last summer.

Black history is being made 

by athletes. This year, Serena 
Williams cemented her legacy as 
the greatest tennis player of all 
time by winning her 23rd Grand 
Slam title. She has won more Grand 
Slam single titles than any other 
person in the Open era — male or 
female. At the 2016 Olympics in 
Rio De Janeiro, gymnast Simone 
Biles stunned the world when she 
took home four gold medals and 
one bronze medal.

Black history is being made by 

creators. Viola Davis made history 
this year when she garnered her 
third Academy Award nomination 
for her role in “Fences.” TV shows 
with majority-Black casts such 
as ABC’s “Scandal,” “Blackish” 
and “How to Get Away with 
Murder” and Fox’s “Empire” 
are 
dominating 
primetime 

viewership. Beyoncé, with the 
release of her album “Lemonade,” 
became the only artist in history to 
have her first six efforts go number 
one on the Billboard Hot 100. 
This, after controversy over her 
unapologetically pro-Black single 
“Formation” and Super Bowl 
performance to match. To top it all 
off, last year Beyoncé became the 
most Grammy-nominated woman 
in the award show’s history.

While accepting her daughter’s 

BET award for video of the year 
last 
summer, 
Tina 
Knowles 

reflected on the deaths of some 
of 
our 
community’s 
greatest 

artists such as Prince and Michael 

Jackson by saying, “I’m hoping 
that we will celebrate them while 
we are alive.” She added, “Let’s 
give our flowers to our artists 
who give so much … Let’s let them 
smell the flowers while they’re 
alive.” In other words, it is always 
appropriate to honor the legacy of 
fallen influences, but it is just as 
important to praise them while 
they are alive and still effecting 
change. Black History Month is 
our time to do just that.

History that is not remembered 

repeats itself. America, if for no 
other reason, owes it to its Black 
citizens to remain educated on this 
nation’s ugly past of enslavement, 
disenfranchisement 
and 
legal 

subjugation. This country has 
resolved to “never forget” the 
horror of the Sept. 11 attacks, 
the Holocaust or the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, yet slavery is not 
universally regarded in the same 
way. As long as there is Black 
History Month, our objective 
should be to remember the 
injustices committed against Black 
people, and work diligently so that 
those types of injustices never 
happen 
again. 
Unfortunately, 

we now have a president who 
is not quite clear of this history. 
President Donald Trump, during 
remarks 
commemorating 
the 

beginning of Black History Month, 
seemed to suggest that Frederick 
Douglass was somehow still alive, 
saying that he is “being recognized 
more and more” today. This, just 
days after claiming that renowned 
civil rights activist and current 
congressman John Lewis was “all 
talk.” In 1965, while protesting 
voting rights violations as the 
chair of the Student Nonviolent 
Coordinating 
Committee 
in 

Selma, Ala., Lewis was brutalized 
by police. He sustained a fractured 
skull on the day that was eventually 
known as Bloody Sunday.

Black History Month should 

evoke joy, pain, laughter, tears, 
celebration and condemnation. 
This time of year is so important 
to me because it is a time to 
remember the past, savor the 
present 
and 
look 
toward 
a 

promising and united future. 
There is no doubt as to whether 
Black History Month should be a 
permanent fixture of our society. 
My hope is that all Americans 
would make a commitment to 
celebrate this special time with 
myself and others.

The Senate bills allocate 

funds to providers to cover 
the costs of hospital room 
fees, rape test kits and other 
medical testing provided to 
survivors of sexual assault, 
while prohibiting providers 
from charging patients for care 
after an assault not covered by 
insurance or not authorized 
by a patient. The bills also 
incentivize 
providers 
to 

ensure that survivors of sexual 
assault receive proper medical 
treatment, regardless of the 
costs they might incur. This 
particularly helps survivors 
of 
lower 
socioeconomic 

status, who might not have 
health insurance to cover the 
costs of treatment.

Furthermore, 
the 
bills, 

if 
passed, 
would 
allocate 

funding 
toward 
training 

medical personnel to tend to 
survivors of sexual assault. 
Since this training is highly 
specific, health care providers 
may have very few — if any 
— personnel available to aid 
survivors. By allocating funds 
toward this training, health 
care providers can increase 
the 
number 
of 
personnel 

able to help surviviors, thus 
improving the efficiency of 
their treatment. 

The 
House 
bill, 
which 

allows the use of a defendant’s 
history 
as 
evidence, 
will 

help survivors defend their 
cases if they choose to bring 

them to court. A 2015 study 
of college men published in 
JAMA Pediatrics estimated 
that 25 percent of sexual 
assailants 
are 
repeat 

offenders, 
a 
phenomenon 

especially 
prevalent 
on 

college 
campuses. 
The 

criminal justice system faces 
difficulties 
in 
prosecuting 

sexual 
assailants 
because, 

in many cases, the state 
prosecutors 
do 
not 
have 

enough 
evidence 
to 
meet 

criminal cases’ standards of 
proof. The private nature of 
sexual assault reduces many 
cases to one person’s word 
against another’s. Allowing 
the 
use 
of 
past 
history 

as 
evidence 
would 
help 

survivors build cases against 
sexual assailants. Pertinent 
information 
such 
as 
an 

assailant’s motives, patterns 
or methods would be used to 
help prosecute an offender in 
a court of law. 

While 
these 
bills 
are 

crucial, much needed steps 
toward ensuring survivors of 
sexual assault obtain care and 
justice, we hope that passing 
these bills will open up more 
important conversations about 
Michigan state law regarding 
sexual assault, such as further 
clarifying the definition of 
consent 
within 
the 
laws. 

Currently, state law does not 
have an explicit definition 
of 
consent, 
which 
often 

complicates 
the 
survivor’s 

case because of the evidentiary 
difficulties the crime presents. 
In 
order 
to 
best 
respect, 

protect and support survivors, 
the state must define consent 
more explicitly.

The 
University’s 
sexual 

misconduct 
policy 
defines 

consent 
as 
“a 
clear 
and 

unambiguous 
agreement, 

expressed outwardly through 
mutually 
understandable 

words or actions, to engage 
in 
a 
particular 
activity. 

Consent must be voluntarily 
given and cannot be obtained 
through coercion or force,” 
which recognizes the need 
for both parties’ agreement 
before engaging in sexual 
activity. Other states, such as 
California and New York, have 
affirmative consent laws that 
explicitly define the criteria 
needed for consent. 

We call upon the state of 

Michigan to pass these bills, 
as even these small steps 
help 
survivors 
immensely. 

However, 
state 
legislators 

must keep in mind the issue of 
sexual assault is much larger 
than the ability to receive 
proper and affordable medical 
treatment and resources to 
build court cases. Due justice 
for all parties will only come 
when the state laws themselves 
are clarified — a good start 
being for the state to pass 
meaningful consent standards.

Black History Month, Through My Eyes

M

y 
heart 
sank 
as 

the 
unthinkable 

happened. 
I 
felt 

the life drain from my body as 
Aroldis Chapman, the Chicago 
Cubs’ dominant closer, gave up 
a game-tying home run to Rajai 
Davis in the bottom of the eighth 
inning in the deciding game of the 
World Series. Memories of trips 
to Wrigley Field in the mid-2000s 
with my dad ran through my brain 
— losing was ingrained in my mind 
so much that I considered myself a 
bad luck charm for the Cubs, only 
to realize that my presence at the 
ballpark didn’t count much toward 
their 108-year drought. It was as 
simple as that; the Cubs can’t win, 
they would never win and game 
seven of the World Series would be 
no different.

Sociologists 
have 
debated 

sports, and their role in society, 
since the emergence of modern 
organized sports in the mid-19th 
century. Facing criticism from 
Marxist theorists, sports have 
been viewed as a manifestation of 
the elite in society, socializing and 
manipulating athletes to unique 
dietary, behavioral and educational 
norms in pursuit of profit. Some 
renowned thinkers, such as Noam 
Chomsky, have gone so far as to 
say that “sports keep people from 
worrying about things that matter.” 
But putting aside sociological 
theory and institutional analysis of 
modern athletics, sports provide us 
with something we often can’t find 
in other areas of our lives: hope.

No year better illustrates the 

value of sports than 2016. Sports, 
although profit-driven and media-
controlled, speak to the masses in 
an almost religious manner. The 
underdog in sports is not merely a 
small-market team or a historically 
poorly performing franchise. The 
underdog is a symbol of hope, 
the spirit of a community and a 
metaphor for social change.

Overcoming 
5,000-1 
odds, 

Leicester City won the Premier 
League title in a performance 
that rocked the global soccer 
community. 
The 
Cleveland 

Cavaliers, down three games to 
one, took down the Golden State 
Warriors in the NBA Finals — 
giving Cleveland its first major 
championship 
in 
its 
46-year 

history. And recently, the New 
England Patriots came back from a 
seemingly lethal deficit to win the 
Super Bowl, to the chagrin of much 
of the western United States.

This same year has been 

characterized 
by 
political 

controversy and change. Sports, 
as a microcosm of society, reflect 
meaning 
that 
transcends 
far 

beyond the boundaries of the foul 
pole or end zone.

On Nov. 9, our campus was quiet. 

To the credit of conservatives, 
Republicans pulled off a comeback 
of sorts in a fair, yet shocking, 
sweep of the nation. Nevertheless, 
the 
funeral-esque 
proceedings 

the day after the 2016 presidential 
election were almost too solemn. 
But for many, it seemed as if the 
rights of minorities, women and 
other disadvantaged groups had 
died with the election results.

That day, sitting thoughtfully 

in the Mary Markley Residence 
Hall lounge with a few of my 
friends from Chicago, a friend 
asked me, “Does it even matter 
anymore that the Cubs won the 
World Series?” I took a moment 
to collect my thoughts. “Yes, 
yes it does,” I responded. The 
Cubs, like all the underdogs of 
2016, represent a hope, binding 
together common wounds and 
bringing together a community. 
Baseball, “America’s pastime,” 
was 
born 
with 
a 
national 

connotation of optimism. I argue 
that it remains a platform from 
which people can derive hope and 
inspiration to make changes.

I said yes because it reminds us 

that nothing is permanent, that 
norms and rules can be changed 
and rewritten, that no deficit or 
adversity is too much to overcome. 
One hundred eight years? Water 
under the bridge. Just as the Cubs 
put behind a history of curses 
and billy goats — omens signaling 
the perpetual nature of the Cubs’ 
failure — those distraught after the 
election could do the same, finding 
within themselves a message of 
hope echoed by sports and political 
heroes alike: Yes we can.

As the year moves forward, 

there will undoubtedly be ongoing 
battles both within and outside the 
U.S. government over political and 
social issues. As we have already 
seen, policies may be put in place 
that align with the fears of many 
in this country, subjugating and 
targeting minority groups on the 
basis of crass, often incorrect, 
generalizations. However, sports 
serve to remind us that in times of 
fear and defeat, there is much ground 
to be made up (108 years worth, for 
example) and change to be made.

So, as I watched distraught 

New England fans desperately 
root for the Patriots down 25 in 
the third quarter of the Super 
Bowl, I remembered the Cubs, 
and how I was sure they would 
lose. I remembered the crack 
of Ben Zobrist’s bat as he shot a 
double down the left field line to 
score the eventual game-winning 
run. I remembered Anthony 
Rizzo’s face as he screamed 
when Kris Bryant made the 
final out. And I remembered 
the voices of protesters on the 
Diag outside my classroom the 
week after. Indeed, the Patriots 
came back to win, in yet another 
example of resilience, something 
from which the American people 
should draw inspiration.

FROM THE DAILY

State should pass sexual assault bills
A

s the future of many nationwide policies that aim to combat 
sexual assault hang in the balance, a bipartisan group of Michigan 
legislators has introduced a package of three bills to assist sexual 

assault survivors. Two of the bills, introduced in the state Senate, aim to 
increase the number of survivors receiving medical treatment and testing 
after an assault by lessening the charges to their insurance agencies and 
increasing funding to health care providers that provide these services. 
Separately, the state House bill allows for the inclusion of evidence that an 
accused assailant previously may have committed another sexual crime. 
These bills, while by no means fixing all the ills that face survivors in the 
aftermath of a sexual assault, go a long way in improving the care and 
justice they would receive in the state of Michigan. The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board implores the Michigan State Legislature to pass these 
bills because they act in the best interest of survivors of sexual assault.

Friday, February 24, 2017 — 5

What will win:

Some performances are stellar for their front-fac-

ing exuberance. Even harder is keeping a vivid char-
acter reserved and internal, with a complex morality 
bubbling and churning beneath the surface while life 
passes before the character’s eyes. Mahershala Ali’s 
Juan, the drug-dealing surrogate father to young Chi-
ron in “Moonlight,” is the highlight of a phenomenal 
cast, precisely because his carefully quiet character 
pops off the screen. Though Juan only appears in the 
first third of the film, his presence is felt throughout, 
not only because of his influence on Chiron, but also 
because Ali weaves an indelibly gnarled charm into 
his character.

What should win:

There’s a bias against young actors when recog-

nizing achievement, partly because they’re simply 
lesser known, partly because they typically lack the 
experience to pull off a great performance. Neverthe-
less, Lucas Hedges is perfect as Patrick Chandler, the 
grieving, complicated nephew at the center of Ken-

neth Lonergan’s brilliant “Manchester by the Sea.” 
Hedges acts with a stunning naturalism that rivals 
few other young performers. His mental breakdown 
about two-thirds through the film throws the audi-
ence into the same emotional explosion as his own, 
while his comedic timing is flawless (see: any scene 
with his amateur punk band).

— Daniel Hensel, Daily Film Editor

 Who will win and who should 

win at Oscars 2017

BEST PICTURE
BEST DIRECTOR

BEST ACTOR

What will win:

Jumped up “controversy” aside, “La La Land” 

has all the momentum as we move towards 
Oscar night. It scooped up the top award at both 
the PGAs, DGAs and BAFTAs, swept every cat-
egory it was nominated for at the Golden Globes 
— setting a new record in the process — and 
was nominated for a whopping fourteen Oscars, 
tying for another record. Even those who hate 
the film must admit that it is the objective favor-
ite of the show, and it holds a strong chance of 
winning the eleven Academy Awards needed to 
tie yet another all-time record.

What should win:

As well it should, because “La La Land” is 

delightful. There’s a reason it is garnering so 
much love. The cinematography is beautiful, 
the story is eminently relatable, Damien Cha-
zelle’s (“Whiplash”) direction is flawless — his 
single-take musical numbers are a marvel — 
and the songs are memorable and speak to the 
film’s deeper themes. That’s without even men-
tioning the absurdly charming performances 

from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the latter 
of whom gave us the heartrendingly emotional 
“Audition” scene. Is it perfect? No, but it is 
doubtlessly the best film nominated and the 
singular most entertaining film of the year.

— Jeremiah Vanderhelm, Daily Arts Writer

What will win:

It comes as a surprise to almost no one that “La 

La Land” is poised to clean up at this year’s awards. 
After taking home top honors in this category at the 
Golden Globes, it looks likely that “La La Land” will 
do it again. While deserving of many of the statues it 
will pick up next week, the film’s screenplay is among 
the weakest of the nominees. The real magic of “La 
La Land” is its visual splendor, the story is structur-
ally familiar and the dialogue leans pretty heavily on 
Gosling and Stone’s — especially Stone’s — natural 
charm. Alas, the Academy has a hard time passing up 
hype and anything about itself.

What should win:

This is a tough one. “20th Century Women” and 

“The Lobster,” both films that, tragically, are only 
nominated in this category, are on par with “Man-
chester By the Sea.” But, it’s Kenneth Lonergan’s 
darkly funny screenplay that deserves top honors. 
Lonergan masters the tricky art of flashbacks and 
writes characters with a precision unseen this award 
season. Lee Chandler is one of the most fully fleshed 
out, powerful characters of the year. The film’s struc-
ture is perfect, the way it at once opens up and caves 
in on itself, revealing and concealing. “Manchester By 
the Sea” is master class example of how movies are 
born on paper.

— Madeleine Gaudin, Senior Arts Editor

What will win:

Hopefully, this year’s Oscars will have at least 

one major upset. Sitting through the four-hour 
long ceremony needs to have some sort of pay-
off. However, this certainly won’t be the case for 
Best Director. In three out of the past four cere-
monies, the winner for Best Director went home 
without a similar trophy for Best Picture. This 
year will probably end this streak, and audiences 
can expect to see Damien Chazelle with more 
hardware than he could ever possibly carry. The 
32 year-old’s “La La Land,” a musical reincarna-
tion of Hollywood’s past, deserves praise. Still, 
by the time he wins this award, along with every-
thing else, audiences may be a bit frustrated that 
their four hour-long commitment didn’t pay off.

What should win:

Barry Jenkins brought to life one of the most 

stunning and compelling movies in recent 
history with “Moonlight.” His work will be 
remembered for decades to come, so clearly he 
deserves the highest recognition for a direc-
tor. But really, Jenkins doesn’t need an Oscar 

to showcase his masterful talent. At this point, 
it would be secondary. Chazelle can walk away 
with the award, but Jenkins will prove to be the 
true winner for years to come. Kenneth Loner-
gan (“Manchester by the Sea”) in previous, less 
competitive years would be the frontrunner. 
Sadly, he’ll also have to wait his turn, consider-
ing that nothing’s stopping Chazelle from win-
ning this year’s prize.

— Will Stewart, Daily Arts Writer

SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT
A24

What will (and should) win:

I’m still confused as to why Viola Davis was nomi-

nated for “supporting actress” rather than a lead, for 
her portrayal of Rose Maxson in Denzel Washington’s 
adaptation of “Fences.” (Edit: I have been told this has 
to do with money. I still don’t understand.) Regard-
less, she should win. Her portrayal of Rose’s strength, 
both in times of relative contentment and even more 
so in times of strife, is striking in its rawness. The 
scene in which she confronts her husband after he 
blindly complains to her, not bothering to recognize 
that she might have sacrificed dreams and aspirations 
too, is one of the most powerful scenes between two 
people in recent cinematic history.

— Sophia Kaufman, Daily Book Editor

What will win:

Marion Cotillard won in 2007 for “La Vie en Rose,” 

becoming the first woman to win for a French-speak-
ing role. Ten years later, Isabelle Huppert (“Elle”) 
could follow Cotillard’s path for her portrayal of 
rape victim Michele Leblanc. That is, if “La La Land” 
weren’t released in the same year. Emma Stone (“La 
La Land”) will win this category with ease, even 
against the beloved Meryl Streep (“Florence Foster 
Jenkins”). Stone’s performance, including the beauti-
fully sung “Audition (The Fools Who Dream),” covers 
all of the Oscar-worthy territory.

What should win:

Filmic depictions of presidents and their lives 

are like gold for the Oscars. Movies about first 
ladies apparently aren’t as successful. Pablo Lar-
raín’s “Jackie,” shockingly, was snubbed in almost 
every category, barely getting any recognition it 
deserved. Fortunately, Natalie Portman’s (“Black 
Swan”) accurate portrayal of ex-first lady Jackie 
Kennedy was one of three nominations the film did 
receive, and rightfully so. She brilliantly brought 
to life the tragedy of JFK’s assassination. In many 

ways, Portman’s performance is the archetype for 
a perfect depiction of a historical figure. Imitating 
each of her many idiosyncrasies and mannerisms, 
Portman lived up to the great challenge of not over-
acting. She won’t win, but she certainly deserves 
her second Oscar after this performance.

— Will Stewart, Daily Arts Writer

PARAMOUNT

What will win:

Casey Affleck’s performance as Lee Chandler in 

“Manchester by the Sea” is nuanced, yet powerful. 
The loner handyman with a mysteriously tragic past 
is portrayed on screen as equally enigmatic and sensi-
tive. Particularly when interacting with his orphaned, 
teenage nephew (a stellar performance by newcomer 
Lucas Hedges), Affleck’s Lee is awkwardly endearing. 
Their banter ranges from dark humor to tender revela-
tions, all while maintaining impressively rugged Bos-
ton accents (reminiscent of another Affleck’s magnum 
opus, “Good Will Hunting”). Affleck will not only get 
the Oscar for inducing the largest collective sob from 
viewers since “Beaches,” but because he created a 
narrative on screen so raw and subtle, that the other 
actors in the category (an especially impressive lot this 
year) pale in comparison.

What should win:

Viggo Mortensen certainly knows how to wield 

a sword, as evidenced by his portrayal of Aragorn in 
“The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, but can he raise six 
children in the wilderness by himself? The answer is 
a resounding yes. In “Captain Fantastic,” Mortensen 

plays Ben Cash, a radical idealist who along with his 
wife, decides to raise their six children in the forests 
of the Pacific Northwest. The eccentrically brilliant 
children are trained in everything from hunting and 
survival skills to theoretical physics and Marxist the-
ory. The Cash kids are as charming and quirky as the 
variety of actors who play them. Mortensen will not 
get the Oscar, but his performance as a father trying 
to reconcile his steadfast philosophies with the well 
being of his children is heartbreakingly honest and 
deserves recognition beyond “Noam Chomsky Day.”

BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY

What will win:

Had “Moonlight” not jumped over to the 

adapted category, I’d say “Arrival,” which 
scooped up the prize at the Writers Guild 
Awards, was a sure win. The short story it’s 
adapted from is absolutely fantastic. However, 
Barry Jenkins’s screenplay is going to be impos-
sible to top. “Moonlight” is too quiet, too per-
fectly understated to lend itself to awards in the 
Best Picture and Best Director categories — the 
Academy prefers the grandeur of something 
like “La La Land.” What is does fit are the Acad-
emy’s ideals for writing. It’s going to win in this 
category because it deserves the top of the tick-
et honors, but it’s sadly not going to win them.

What should win:

One of the oddities in this year’s award 

season is the flip-flopping the “Moonlight” 
screenplay has done between the adapted and 
original screenplay categories. The screen-
play won best original at the Writers Guild 
Awards last Sunday, but is nominated as an 
adapted screenplay at the Oscars. In any writ-
ing category, “Moonlight” deserves the win. 
Barry Jenkins’s transformation of Tarell Alvin 
McCraney’s unpublished, unperformed play is 
incredible and truly deserving on all the hon-
ors it can get.

HELP WANTED

“Paterson” is about a bus driver 

named Paterson in Paterson, New 
Jersey; it’s perfectly convenient. 
Every day, Paterson 
wakes up, goes to 
work, comes home, 
eats dinner with his 
wife, walks the dog 
and gets a beer at 
the bar. He’s a simple 
man who sees the beauty in small 
things in everyday life without get-
ting distracted by the complexities 
of the modern world, like smart-
phones and social media. Through-
out the movie, he incorporates his 
unique outlook into his poems, 
which he writes in between his 
work shifts. Paterson is one of the 
most lovable and virtuous charac-
ters seen on screen in years. Thanks 
to this, along with a number of 
other spectacular qualities, “Pat-
erson” is one of 2016’s best movies, 
and one that will be remembered 
for decades to come.

Director 
Jim 
Jarmusch 

(“Gimme Danger”) creates a world 
so realistic, yet so impossibly 
romantic and compelling. Never 
before has a simple daily routine 
strictly followed been so entertain-
ing. The movie begins on Monday 
and chronicles the rest of the week, 
sucking viewers into Paterson’s 
daily rituals. By the time Wednes-
day evening comes, the audience is 

genuinely excited to watch Pater-
son walk his dog, go to the bar for 
a beer and see Doc (Barry Shabaka 
Henley, “Life”), the bartender and 
Paterson’s friend. Paterson is well 
known in the bar, and is somewhat 
of a hometown hero. Brief moments 

highlight his cour-
age, though with-
out it ever feeling 
like 
anything 

is 
expected 
in 

return.

Adam 
Driver 

(“Silence”) stars as the eponymous 
character; without his distinct style 
and phenomenal chops, this movie 
would feel empty. In “Paterson,” 
he once again demonstrates his 
diverse talent and ability to play 
many roles, ranging from angsty 
Sith Lord Kylo Ren in “Star Wars: 
The Force Awakens” to the nutty 
Brooklynite Lev Shapiro in “Fran-
ces Ha.” This performance, charac-
terized by his long stares and sharp 
deliveries, solidifies him as one of 
this generation’s best.

Paterson’s wife, Laura, played by 

Golshifteh Farahani (“M for Moth-
er”) in one of the year’s strongest 
performances, is the perfect match 
for Paterson. Their supportive rela-
tionship, filled with optimism and 
serenity, is beautiful to watch. Both 
live separate, independent lives, 
while still intertwined in the love 
they share. He supports Laura and 
her many ambitious — often comi-
cally unrealistic — dreams, and she 
is his biggest supporter, constantly 

urging him to share his poems with 
the rest of the world. “Paterson” 
shows what true love looks like in 
its most authentic form. It’s never 
overly effusive and demonstrates 
the unconditional joy produced 
when two people love and sup-
port each other. Seeing two people 
coexist so peacefully shows hope 
in an increasingly hostile world; 
watching Laura and Paterson is 
almost therapeutic.

The movie contains many sin-

cere moments and interactions, 
and avoids feeling too earnest. In a 
way, other people make up for Pat-
erson’s quiet demeanor, providing 
a good chunk of dialogue during 
conversations with him. The inter-
actions Paterson overhears on the 
bus feel like actual recordings of 
people talking freely as if no one is 
listening. It’s so refreshing to hear 
natural dialogue that doesn’t sound 
overly rehearsed or plotted out, but 
rather two people having an ordi-
nary conversation.

Meditative shots show the still-

ness of the town’s life, whether it’s 
driving his bus or watching a stun-
ning waterfall. There’s never a dull 
moment in the movie, which is say-
ing a lot for one without a true plot 
or conflict.

“Paterson” is a personal and 

quiet story about a blue collar man, 
his wife and their dreams and pas-
sions. At its core, it’s about as simple 
as it gets. Accessible and uplifting, 
“Paterson” has something to offer 
everyone.

If you crossed 2050s tech-

nology with 1950s fashion with 
2017 ignorance and looked at it 
all through a pastel filter, you’d 
be within a stone’s throw of 
Katy Perry’s video compliment 
to her new single, “Chained to 
the 
Rhythm.” 

Set 
in 
a 
fic-

tional 
theme 

park, the video 
is 
prime 
for 

the Katy Perry 
Teenage Dream-
world treatment 
apparent in past videos like 
“Dark Horse” and “Califor-
nia Gurls.” Though all three 
videos share a director and 
a highly embellished visual 
vocabulary, “Chained to the 
Rhythm” decidedly leaves the 
CandyLand fantasy behind in 
favor of a confectionery night-
mare.

To start, the theme park is 

called Oblivia. The viewer is 
not-so-subtly informed of this 
when the second image of the 
video features large neon car-
toon letters that spell “OBLIV-
IA.” This frame is immediately 
succeeded by footage of Perry 
excitedly rushing through the 
park’s gates, complete with a 
futuristic white dress, pink 
hair and an over enthusiastic 
smile. She sings “are we crazy? 
/ living our lives through a lens 
/ trapped in our white-picket 
fence.”

Let’s pause.
It’s 
no 
coincidence 
that 

“Oblivia” differs only a few 
letters 
from 
“oblivious.” 

The opening lyrics alone are 
enough to hint at Perry’s dis-
taste with the average person’s 
desire to ignore the conflict-
ridden world by hiding in their 
peaceful 
fenced-in 
homes. 

When these lyrics are com-

bined with the park’s name and 
performers’ plastered smiles, 
parallels between the blindly 
euphoric patrons of Oblivia 
and the ignorant residents of 
the real world are visible.

Let’s resume with this in 

mind.

The 
remaining 
four-min-

utes are a profusion of very 
happy people living very happy 

lives 
and 
wear-

ing very brightly-
colored 
clothing. 

But the perfection 
is tainted by the 
uneasiness 
that 

accompanies 
too 

much 
happiness. 

A quick flash of the number 
1984 in the form of a ride’s wait 
time estimate draws a link 
to George Orwell’s dystopian 
novel suggesting this world is 
not as perfect as it appears.

Within 
these 
scenes 
of 

apparent bliss, Perry is able 
to tackle a staggering number 
of relevant issues. Panning 
through footage of blatant 
cultural references such as 
choreographed 
selfie-taking, 

a roller-coaster emoji tunnel 
and a “validation station” like-
o-meter, Perry ensures no part 
of her satirical criticism of the 
over-connected, 
technology-

obsessed masses gets lost in 
translation. Later, she stops by 
“Inferno H20” for a beaker of 
flaming water. Clearly resem-
bling a gas station, “Inferno 
H20” predicts that abuse of our 
world’s resources may lead to 
the strict control of water dis-
tribution, similar to oil’s cur-
rent regulation. At one point, 
happy couples hurriedly climb 
aboard “The Great American 
Dream Drop,” a ride that fea-
tures quaint houses dangling 
from strings.

Yet despite all of this blar-

ing commentary, the people of 
Oblivia remain oblivious. They 
continue to live comfortably 

in their bubble. Still, the bliss 
of being utterly disconnected 
does not last forever. As in all 
classic dystopian narratives, 
someone breaks out of the 
trance. Who? Katy Perry, of 
course.

A rose thorn pricking her 

finger in the first 30 seconds 
serves as the first sign that the 
world isn’t all cotton candy 
and 
flying 
roller 
coasters. 

The next and final realization 
moment comes in the final 
montage, which includes the 
3D screening of a fictional film 
entitled “A Nuclear Family.” 
While spectators robotically 
bob their heads, Skip Marley 
appears on the colossal-sized 
retro TV to contribute his 
verse. Eventually stepping out 
of the screen, Marley seems to 
jolt Perry from her hypnotic 
daze.

Spliced into this scene are 

clips of Perry running on a 
human-sized hamster wheel. 
At first putting forward her 
best 
effort, 
she 
ultimately 

slows to a stand. Her expres-
sion suggests complete con-
sciousness. The video ends 
with Perry’s pink painted eye-
lids locked on the camera and a 
look of complete horror.

This video marks a new era 

of Katy Perry. Although she 
has never shied away from 
releasing PSAs in the form of 
massively successful singles, 
the condemnation of modern 
society as oblivious and robot-
ic is undoubtedly a step up 
from reminding everyone that 
they’re fireworks or saying it’s 
totally fine to kiss a girl and 
like it. Through this video, as 
well as a stellar Grammy per-
formance, Perry has informed 
her fans and the general public 
that she is ready to approach 
the treacherous arena of cur-
rent day politics. Prepare your-
selves for a wave of political 
pop.

Michigan routs Nebraska on Senior Night

Back on Jan. 22, the No. 25 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team traveled to Lincoln and 
defeated 
Nebraska, 
84-51. 
It 
was 

the Wolverines’ most lopsided 
victory in Big Ten play. 

Michigan was just five points 

away from tying that margin 
Thursday night at Crisler Center, 
as the Wolverines routed the 
Cornhuskers, 88-60. The win 
snapped a two-game skid for 
Michigan.

Though it was Senior Night, 

it was the younger players who 
took charge for the Wolverines 
(11-5 Big Ten, 22-7 overall). While 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
led with 25 points, freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick was 
only one rebound away from a 
double-double, nabbing 21 points 
and nine boards. Sophomore 
center Hallie Thome notched 21 
points and seven rebounds of her 
own.

“It was definitely a bounce-

back game,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “I thought 
we shared the ball really well. 
I thought we were able to make 
shots. Also to honor (senior 
guards Siera Thompson and 
Danielle Williams) in their last 
home contest.”

Michigan wasted little time 

gaining a lead in the first quarter, 
hitting 10 of its first 12 shots to 
take a 28-11 lead at the end of the 
frame. Flaherty led the charge 
by sinking three 3-point shots, 
which was three more than 
she made in the last two games 
combined. Gondrezick made two 
long-range baskets of her own 
in the frame, matching her total 
from the previous two contests.

“Katelynn is such an incredible 

scorer,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
think the other day Michigan 
State really keyed in on her and 
limited her touches. And that 
made it difficult for her. Anytime 

she gets a good look, you feel like 
she can score the basketball.”

But it was the Wolverines’ 

defense that really stood out in 
the first quarter. Michigan held 
Nebraska (2-13, 6-21) to just 26.7 
percent shooting and allowed 
only one basket from behind the 
arc.

The Wolverines’ momentum 

continued in the second quarter 
as Gondrezick and Flaherty 
opened the frame with back-to-
back 3-pointers. That allowed 
Michigan 
to 
take 
a 
44-26 

advantage into halftime despite 
a 9-0 Cornhusker run to end 
the frame. Nebraska helped 
Michigan’s cause by turning the 
ball over five times.

The third quarter belonged 

to Thome, though, who drew 
four fouls in the first seven 
minutes, including one after a 
made basket. Her ability to get 
to the free-throw line added 
nine points to the Wolverines, 
allowing them to take a 62-41 
edge into the final quarter. 
Thome’s production made up for 

the fact that Michigan sank just 
five of its 14 shots in the frame.

“I was so happy with how 

many times she was able to get 
to the free-throw line,” Barnes 
Arico said. “That was incredible 
for us. I hope she can continue to 
do that moving forward.”

Thome, 
Flaherty 
and 

Gondrezick continued to carry 
the team in the fourth quarter, 
as Flaherty grabbed six more 
points, Gondrezick nabbed five 
and Thome scored two. The trio’s 
contributions, as has been the 
case for much of the year, carried 
the Wolverines to victory.

But the seniors weren’t about 

to let the underclassmen soak 
up all of the glory. With three 
minutes 
remaining, 
Williams 

sank a 3-point shot, instantly 
quadrupling her point total for 
the game. Thompson added a 
3-pointer of her own a little over 
a minute later, bringing her point 
total to eight.

“I don’t really think about 

scoring and stuff like that,” 
Thompson said. “I’m just trying 

to get a win. And yeah, it’s about 
me because it’s Senior Night, but 
you want to get a win first.”

With Thursday’s victory, the 

Wolverines accomplished two 
notable feats. Michigan earned 
its 22nd win of the season, which 
is tied for the most in program 
history, and clinched third place 
in the Big Ten for just the fourth 
time in school history. A lot of 
attention will now be paid to the 
Big Ten Tournament and a likely 
berth in the NCAA Tournament.

With all of that in mind, it’s 

easy to forget that the Wolverines 
still have another regular-season 
contest. Michigan will travel to 
State College on Sunday to take 
on Penn State (8-7, 18-9), who 
led Michigan State by 18 points 
on Wednesday before ultimately 
falling, 73-64.

“They’re a good team, and 

they’re a really good team 
at home,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They’re led by one of the best 
guards in the country in Teniya 
Paige. They’ll be ready to go, it’s 
the last home game for them.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Seniors shine in finale

Up 25 points with five minutes 

to go against Nebraska, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team had all but won the game. 
On any other day, the Wolverines 
would be content. But tonight was 
Senior Night, and senior guards 
Siera Thompson and Danielle 
Williams weren’t finished with 
their last regular-season home 
game yet — so they put on a show. 

Williams, who only had one 

point in the first three quarters, 
sunk a 3-pointer with three 
minutes left. Thompson followed 
suit at the 1:38 mark, and both 
earned appreciative applause from 
the crowd. Tonight, that crowd 
included their families who made 
the trip to be in the stands. But the 
co-captains focused on staying 
humble.

“I didn’t really think about 

that (shot) during the game,” said 
Williams. “But it was cool.”

When Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico took Thompson and 
Williams out with only one tick 
left on the clock, the fans erupted, 
showing their gratitude for the 
Wolverine seniors.

Thompson and Williams are 

the first Michigan players to spend 
their entire careers under Barnes 
Arico, as the duo were part of her 
first recruiting class. They stepped 
out of their comfort zones to 
come to Michigan, with Williams 
committing from Phoenix and 
Thompson hailing from Gardena, 
Calif. 
Thompson 
had 
never 

even visited the campus before 
committing.

“They packed their bags and 

flew across the country because 
they believed in a vision that 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

could have,” Barnes Arico said. 
“For them to leave as seniors, 
potentially being the winningest 
players in program history as well 
as a top 20 ranking, doing things 
that have never been done before 
— they are so deserving.”

Neither senior leads the team in 

points, but they have found other 
ways to guide the team. Thompson 
had 140 assists going into the 
game — the most of any current 
Michigan player. She stayed true 
to form against the Cornhuskers, 
tallying five more and adding eight 
points and three rebounds.

And Williams, who has started 

in 16 of 29 games this season, 
shines particularly on defense. She 
earned four defensive boards — the 
second-most of all the Wolverines 
— despite playing just 19 minutes.

“Siera is the G.O.A.T. (Greatest 

Of All Time),” Williams said. “She’s 
so consistent, so calm, and I almost 
don’t have any words to describe 
her impact on the program. Every 
day she is someone to look to who 
is always cool, calm and collected, 
but just gets it done.”

Added Thompson: “(Williams) 

will do anything for you. She puts 
others before herself, and I think 
that’s one of the best qualities 
about her. And that’s why our 
team is so great. Without Danielle, 
we wouldn’t be the team we are 
today.”

The two seniors are part of an 

undoubtedly 
successful 
team. 

They earned their 22nd win of the 
season against the Cornhuskers, 
tying the program record for most 
wins in a season.

“It’s great to come in and 

make history and do something 
that’s never been done before,” 
Thompson said. “Because that’s 
what Coach told us. She told us 
if you follow my vision, you will 
make history.”

With one game left in the 

regular 
season 
on 
Saturday 

against Penn State, Michigan has a 
chance to become the first team in 
program history to win 23 games. 
So, despite the praise, the seniors 
are not letting themselves get 
swept up in celebrations just yet.

“I feel like there is a lot of the 

season left to be played,” Williams 
said.

Even though their careers are 

coming to an end, with program 
history right around the corner, 
there’s a lot to look forward to. 

ICE HOCKEY
‘M’ hits road to take 
on No. 11 Ohio State

A week ago, the Michigan 

hockey team was swept in 
Madison by No. 19 Wisconsin, 
losing 5-2 and 6-4. And after a 
week of practice, the Wolverines 
will be back on the road when 
they travel to Columbus for their 
final regular-season road trip.

Michigan (2-10-2 Big Ten, 

9-16-3 overall) will face No. 
12 Ohio State on Friday and 
Saturday for the second time 
this season. After the two-game 
series, the Wolverines will return 
to Yost the following week to 
close the regular season with 
a home series 
against No. 11 
Penn State.

Michigan 

split 
its 
first 

series matchup 
with 
Ohio 

State 
(7-6-1, 

16-8-6) 
the 

first 
weekend 

of 
February, 

winning 
the 

first game, 5-4, 
and falling in the second, 6-5. 
While the first game proved 
that the Wolverines could top a 
ranked opponent, they struggled 
with the Buckeyes’ offense and 
were unable to record what 
would have been their first sweep 
of the season.

“They’re 
a 
really 
good 

offensive team, we know that,” 
said sophomore forward Cooper 
Marody. “They have a ton of 
guys with great skill. They have 
an unbelievable power play, so 
definitely a key for the weekend 
is staying out of the box and 
really competing. If it’s in front 
of the net to box out a guy or just 
battling in the corner, it’s going to 
be really important.”

In each game of the first 

series, four different players 
from the Buckeyes’ roster scored, 
highlighting the depth in their 
lineup. 

But possibly the biggest factor 

in Ohio State’s success stemmed 

from its power play, which proved 
to be instrumental in both games. 
The Buckeyes capitalized on 
man-up advantages throughout 
the series, scoring seven power-
play goals on the weekend.

“It is a concern, and I think we 

learned from it,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “I thought 
we were a lot better last week, we 
worked on it last week and we’ll 
work on it a little bit tomorrow. 
But an important thing is to stay 
out of the penalty box.

“We ended up taking 14 

penalties that weekend. This 
past weekend, we gave up one 
power-play goal on Friday and 
then a shorthanded goal, but we 

only had to kill 
six penalties the 
whole weekend. 
We’ve got to stay 
out of the box.”

This 
past 

weekend against 
the 
Badgers, 

Michigan 
showed signs of 
improvement 
despite the losses. 
The penalty kill 

limited Wisconsin to a single 
power-play goal, and time in 
the 
penalty 
box 
drastically 

decreased.

In addition to the penalty kill, 

other improvements were made 
throughout the game to give the 
Wolverines an edge. 

“I thought we had a lot of 

improvement 
in 
our 
game,” 

Berenson said. “Whether it was 
our forecheck, coming out on the 
ice, managing the puck better, 
getting shots on the net, creating 
scoring chances, giving up fewer 
chances. We were a better team 
than the score gave us credit for 
at the end of the game. We didn’t 
finish the game as strong as we 
needed to, and that’s going to be 
another challenge for us.”

In one of its last few chances 

this season to notch a Big Ten 
win, Michigan will have to 
display all of these improvements 
together — and it’ll be necessary 
facing a team like Ohio State.

Wolverines set for tough contest
with No. 14 Purdue in home finale

Since upsetting then-No. 11 

Wisconsin at Crisler Center last 
Thursday 
night, 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team (8-7 Big 
Ten, 
18-10 

overall) has hit 
a bit of a rocky 
road.

In 
two 

away contests 
against 
Minnesota and 
Rutgers 
over 

the past week, 
the Wolverines 
were pushed to their limit, facing 
deficits late and needing swift 
responses.

On Sunday in Minneapolis, the 

Golden Gophers took their largest 
lead of the game at 68-60 with 
just 2:54 remaining in regulation. 
Though Michigan battled back 
and sent the game to overtime off 
an NBA-range three from redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
with two ticks left on the clock, 
Minnesota regained the lead with 
2:03 left in the extra period and 
held on for an 83-78 win.

Three days later in Piscataway, 

the 
Scarlet 
Knights 
took 
a 

56-52 lead with 6:46 remaining 
following a five-minute, 15-4 
run. This time, the Wolverines 
responded with a 10-0 run of their 
own — bookended by baskets 
from sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner — to regain the lead and 
escape with a 68-64 victory. 

The Golden Gophers were 

projected to be a tough matchup 
for Michigan — both teams sat at 

6-6 in the Big Ten — while last-
place Rutgers proved to be a more 
challenging foe than expected. 
But in both cases, the Wolverines 
had only themselves to blame for 
allowing the outcome of the game 
to be decided in the final stretch.

Though the outcome ended up 

in their favor in Piscataway, it went 
the other way in Minneapolis. 
It seems likely that the outcome 
should be decided much earlier on 
Saturday in Michigan’s upcoming 
matchup against No. 14 Purdue 
(12-3, 23-5).

The Wolverines will return 

to Ann Arbor to take on the 
conference-leading Boilermakers, 
who are in the midst of a six-
game win streak, in their final 
home game of the season. A 
contest in Crisler Center should 
be a welcome sight, as Michigan 
has dropped just three games on 
its home court this year. But the 

Wolverines will be up against the 
toughest task they have faced in 
their own arena.

Purdue boasts the best offense 

in the Big Ten, averaging 81 
points per game, and ranks as 
the fourth-best defense as well, 
allowing 66.2 per game. Those 
lofty numbers give them a plus-
14.9 scoring margin — also tops in 
the conference.

Contributing to their top-

ranked offense, the Boilermakers 
lead the Big Ten in both field-goal 
percentage and 3-point field-goal 
percentage, averaging clips of 48.1 
and 41.3, respectively. That could 
spell major trouble for Michigan, 
which ranks last and second-
to-last on defense in those same 
categories, allowing its opponents 
to shoot 46.4 percent from the 
floor and 38.9 percent from 
beyond the arc, respectively.

The Wolverines will go up 

against standout forward Caleb 
Swanigan, who leads his team 
with a double-double average of 
18.6 points and 12.9 rebounds per 
game on the season. He is flanked 
in the middle by forward Vincent 
Edwards and assisted off the 
bench by center Isaac Haas, both 
of whom also average double-
digit points with 11.8 and 13.4 
points, respectively.

In order to make up for their 

deficiencies on the defensive end, 
the Wolverines will need to exploit 
one of Purdue’s key weaknesses: 
turnovers. And fortunately for 
them, that happens to be one of 
their biggest strengths.

While the Boilermakers sit at 

the bottom of the conference with 
a minus-1.2 turnover margin — 
committing an average of 13.4 
per game — Michigan occupies 
the top spot, forcing an average of 
12.8 while committing just 9.5 by 
comparison.

Even so, the Wolverines will 

have their work cut out for 
them Saturday against the stiff 
challenge that is Purdue. In this 
case, if the outcome of the game 
isn’t decided until late, it may 
prove to be a victory in and of 
itself.
