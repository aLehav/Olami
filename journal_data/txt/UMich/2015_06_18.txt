Warrior-Scholar 

academic bootcamp 
helps veterans adjust 

to University life

By ALAINA WYGNAT

Daily Staff Reporter

“It’s kind of a long story,” 

Adam Pawlowski said, speak-
ing about how he came to be one 
of 20 veterans at the Warrior-
Scholar Project at the University.

For the second year in a row, 

the University hosted the pro-
gram, one-week academic boot 
camp designed to help service-
men and women make the tran-
sition from the military to the 
classroom.

The Warrior-Scholar Project 

began at Yale University in 2012 
and has expanded to 11 colleges

According to University alum 

Ryan Pavel, the program direc-
tor for the University’s cam-
pus and a former marine, it will 
expand to seven more campuses 

this year.

“The veterans have a rigorous 

schedule and are taught using a 
humanities-based curriculum,” 
a course packet on the program 
reads. “There is Tocqueville on 
American democracy, Shelley’s 
poem 
‘Ozymandias,’ 
Hannah 

Arendt’s political philosophy on 
freedom and quite a number of 
style manuals, guides and essays 
on writing.”

Pavel 
said 
the 
academic 

coursework 
is 
rigorous 
and 

because it is contained to one 

weeks, students take it seriously.

“It’s long days,” Pavel said. 

“Breakfast is at 8, and most days, 
we push until 10 or 11 at night. 
When students come here, they 
know it’s only one week and that 
they have a lot to do, so it’s very 
focused.”

With the exception of trans-

portation costs, the program is 
free for selected veterans thanks 
to funding from private donors 
such as the National Endowment 
for the Humanities.

Festival attracts 
attendees from 
across the state 

By SAM COREY

For the Daily

The annual Ann Arbor Sum-

mer Festival kicked off June 
12 on North University Avenue 
with various activities and live 
musical performances.

Established in 1984 by micro-

film pioneer Eugene Power, in 

collaboration with the city of 
Ann Arbor and the University, 
the festival is known for its per-
formances by eclectic groups of 
domestic and international art-
ists.

The festival is open six days 

a week and reins in close to 
80,000 
attendees 
each 
year 

for simultaneously occurring 
indoor and outdoors programs. 
Friday’s 
activities 
included 

entertainment by dancers, musi-
cians, comedians and actors.

Festival activities are made 

possible each year through the 

work of volunteers and dona-
tions from regular attendees. 
LSA junior Rob Smith said he 
enjoys how the event engages 
the Ann Arbor community.

“It has a vast range of musical 

talent and is a place for people 
to gather and just see people 
that they wouldn’t be able to see 
throughout the year. It’s a won-
derful community event,” said 
Smith.

Outdoor programs, otherwise 

known as Top of the Park, make 
up 90 percent of the festival’s 
activities and include outdoor 

movies, 
concerts, 
workouts, 

organized dancing, educational 
programs and food vendors.

According to Amy Nesbitt, 

the director of the festival, 
there has been a steady fusion 
between the indoor and outdoor 
programs.

“It used to be segmented 

between indoor and outdoor 
programs. Over the years, we’ve 
tried really hard to braid that 
experience,” Nesbitt said.

Each year the nonprofit fes-

tival’s steering team sends a

New master’s 
program promotes 
global collaboration

Program connects 
business, engineering 

students through 
partnership with 

universities in China 

By ALEX JUNTTI

Daily Staff Reporter

The Stephen M. Ross School 

of Business has partnered with 
Shanghai Jiao Tong Universi-
ty, one of China’s leading uni-
versities, and the University’s 
SJTU Joint Institute to initi-
ate a Master of Management 
program. The program will be 
for Joint Institute engineer-
ing students, and will provide 
a basis for faculty research 
and collaboration between the 
Business School and the SJTU 
Antai College of Economics 
and Management.

The Joint Institute was 

founded in 2006 and repre-
sents a strategic global part-
nership between China and 
the United States. Its primary 
mission is to establish a highly 
reputable institute for innova-
tive global engineering educa-
tion and research.

The program currently sup-

ports more than 1,000 under-
graduates, most of whom are 
Chinese, 
studying 
comput-

er, mechanical and electri-
cal engineering in Shanghai. 
More than 20 full-time faculty 
members teach all of the avail-
able courses in English.

Launched in 2014, Master 

of Management Program at 
the Business School is meant 
to provide students who have 
little undergraduate business 
experience with a firm under-
standing of business strategy 
and concepts.

The Master of Management 

program for the Joint Insti-

tute’s 
engineering 
students 

will begin in July. Students 
will study business concepts 
in China before arriving in 
Ann Arbor in the fall for nine 
months of study at the Busi-
ness School.

In 
May, 
students 
will 

return to China, where they 
will conclude their program 
by completing a seven-week, 
action-based 
learning 
cap-

stone project led by Busi-
ness School faculty in which 
students work on real world 
projects with multinational 
corporation based in China.

Liz Muller, the director of 

global initiatives for the Ross 
School of Business, said the 
interdisciplinary 
nature 
of 

the program is perfect for stu-
dents looking to add relevant 
business experience to an 
already impressive degree.

“A lot of engineers go into 

strict engineering and as they 
progress through their career, 
they need management skills 
to really take that next step 
into business and industry,” 
Muller said. “We see one of 
our best opportunities for 
collaboration in China being 
not only cross-culturally but 
cross-disciplinary, so we’re 
really interested in the inter-
section of business and engi-
neering or business and health 
for example.”

M.S. Krishnan, associate 

dean for global initiatives at 
the Business School, said the 
partnership not only benefits 
students by providing them 
with a diverse, global educa-
tion, but is also advantageous 
to numerous faculty mem-
bers because it provides new 
opportunities for business col-
laboration and research.

“We are trying to open up 

a platform for our faculty to 
visit China and to these com-
panies so we can understand

Kyle 
Piunti, 
who 
went 

through the boot camp in 2014 
and 
subsequently 
attended 

Columbia University, is now a 
tutor in analytical reading. He 
said seeing the growth of his 
students has been rewarding.

“A lot of students, when they 

first come in, are overwhelmed 
with a text,” Piunti said. “Then 
you start to see them develop 
as far as understanding the 
text and the direction in which 
we’re taking them.”

People from every branch of 

the service attended the boot 
camp this year. Two veterans 
who attended this year’s camp 
are Pawlowski and Cody Gil-
man, who said they are consid-
ering attending the University 
in the future.

Though they attended the 

camp together, their stories 
regarding transition from mili-
tary to academic life are differ-
ent.

Pawlowski received an asso-

ciate’s degree in political sci-
ence and joined the Marine 
Corps, but a leg injury forced 
him to leave the service and 
pursue a different path.

“... I was on a combat deploy-

ment in the Middle East and, 
from a severe blow, I got 
injured,” Pawlowski said. “I had 
11 surgeries and almost lost my 
leg. I realized, I can’t do what 
I love any more, so I’m going to 
have to go to school.”

Pawlowski then decided to 

return to political science and 
pursue a bachelor’s degree. He 

said the Warrior-Scholar Proj-
ect has both given him the skill-
set to be a successful student 
and also broadened his view of 
the world.

“Education in general just 

kind of helps mold the way you 
think, your character, the way 
you live your life and the way 
you see things,” Pawlowski 
said. “Being here has shown me 
that I can be a student, that I 
can excel at an upper-division 
type of school. If I had gotten 
injured, got out of the military 
and just went back to school, 
I would’ve done myself a dis-
honor and a disfavor because I 
would’ve been scrounging for 
help.”

Cody 
Gilman 
attended 

Kalamazoo Valley Community 
College before joining the mili-
tary. During college, he said, 
his time management and writ-
ing skills needed to be honed. 
While he was in the military, he 
said, he still wanted to go back 
to school, so when his sergeant 
told him about the Warrior-
Scholar Project, he applied.

“The military is so simple, 

and this is kind of an eye-open-
ing experience. To get you into 
that dense material and being 
able to understand and dissect 
it gives you confidence to know 
you can keep up in a class led by, 
really, some of the best profes-
sors in the country, arguably” 
said Gilman.

According to the Warrior-

Scholar Project’s website, every 
person who has gone through 
the program and gone to college 
has continued pursuing their 
education.

mass e-mail to Ann Arbor res-

idents to ask about what artists 
they would like to see perform. 
According to Nesbitt, this year 
the team received more than 
1,500 responses. Upon process-
ing information about artist 
preferences, the festival team 
then collaborates with potential 
artists, while being conscious of 
providing a variety of genres for 
attendees.

“Four hundred artists submit 

to play Top of the Park. We try to 
keep a broad mix of a lot of dif-
ferent genres, so its accessible to 
people — bluegrass, punk, rock, 
R&B, etcetera,” Nesbitt said.

Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
like 

Joseph Tau, a rising sophomore 
at the local Skyline high school, 
attend the festival as well. 
Tau said he has partaken in its 
events for several years.

“I came here a couple times 

last summer and I went almost 
every night the summer before 
that. I like the movies a lot and 
hanging out with people and lis-
tening to music,” said Tau.

The festival also attracts peo-

ple from outside of Ann Arbor, 
such as Ferdinand Magellin, an 
Ohio native who is on a road 
trip with no final destination 
in mind. On his exploration 
through America, he fortuitous-
ly stopped in Ann Arbor and 
spoke of his admiration for the 
city.

“Ann Arbor is beautiful. It’s 

very nice — a lot of pleasant 
people, nice environment, great 
food, great music. You get the 

best of everything,” Magellin 
said.

Magellin said he was particu-

larly looking forward to hearing 
from “The Appleseed Collec-
tive” Thursday because of their 
“gypsy jazz, swing” genre.

Top of the Park also provides 

activities targeted for a young-
er audience in a portion called 
Kidzone. At the Kidzone Fri-
day, children were able to play 
orchestral instruments under 
the guidance of volunteers.

Nick Penizinsky, a violinist 

from Milford, was one such vol-
unteer, and said he felt nostalgic 
as he recalled learning to play 
the violin.

“I liked playing string instru-

ments, so I thought I’d help out, 
help people learn better. It’s 
been a lot of fun watching (kids) 
learn how to play. It reminds me 
of when I learned how to play,” 
Penizinsky said.

While not that much has 

changed about the festival over 
the years, Nesbitt spoke of the 
expanding reach of the festival 
due to technological advance-
ments. 
As 
of 
the 
festival’s 

opening night, 27,000 people 
downloaded the digital app to 
follow the event.

“So many people are living 

on their mobile device, there’s 
so much information,” Nesbitt 
said. “To rise above that noise, 
it’s a very different way to figure 
out what’s going on and engage.”

Although 
the 
sights 
and 

sounds of the festival can be 
found on the web, Nesbitt said 
she is weary of those who watch 
the fun from the comfort of 
their own home.

“I’m very about live events 

— you can download this expe-
rience, but if you weren’t there 
to get the ‘oohs’ and the ‘ahhhs,’ 
you didn’t get the magic that of

New law aims to protect religious freedom 

Law may protect 
adoption agencies 
that refuse service 
to same-sex couples 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Thursday, Gov. Rick Sny-

der (R) approved a bill that 
will allow private adoption 
agencies to deny adoption to 
prospective parents on the 
grounds that providing ser-
vices would violate religious 
beliefs.

Many see this bill as tar-

geting same-sex couples, and 
is widely opposed by LGBTQ 
advocates.

The 
state 
House 
passed 

the bill in a 65 to 44 ruling in 
accordance with Snyder’s deci-
sion.

The law protects any gov-

ernment-funded child-placing 
agency against legal action by 
state or local governments for 
refusing services considered 
contrary to the agency’s reli-
gious convictions. However, 
the Senate included a stipula-
tion that any couple refused 
adoption 
rights 
would 
be 

referred to another agency or 

to a state website.

Joshua Pugh, former Michi-

gan 
Democrats 
communica-

tions director, was incredulous 
about the law.

“It’s really disgusting that in 

2015 that we are literally legal-
izing discrimination against 
people because of who they are 
or who they love.”

Pugh said he finds the tim-

ing of this law incredible, in 
light of the impending U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling on the 
legality of same-sex unions.

Snyder told the Associated 

Press he anticipates litigation 
in response to the law, which 
he has received in the past 

— specifically, the 2012 law-
suit filed by April DeBoer and 
Jayne Rowse, who challenged 
Michigan’s same-sex marriage 
ban.

Pugh agrees the passage of 

this law is allowing a state-
funded service the immunity 
of a church.

“The 
U.S. 
Constitution 

couldn’t be any more clear 
about how the state should 
treat religion and religious 
agencies,” said Pugh, “They 
should not be supported with 
taxpayer dollars — it’s com-
pletely inappropriate.”

The bill was received by Sny-

der Wednesday from the large-

ly Republican state Senate.

Gideon Dassandro, spokes-

man for Speaker of the House 
Kevin Kline, stated the law 
is necessary for the future of 
Michigan’s adoption agencies.

“There is a compelling case 

to be made that without this 
bill, it is possible that you could 
see a lot of adoption agencies 
shut down in the future.”

Dessandro said these agen-

cies are largely Catholic or 
Lutheran, and if the law is 
changed it would have reper-
cussions for the system.

“Hypothetically, 
in 
the 

future, so that they have to

OPINION

“W

hat did you say?”

“Nothing, sorry I 

— uh, was just talk-

ing to myself.”

When I’m in a 

crowd, I often tell 
people this after 
quietly mumbling 
something 
they 

may 
not 
hear, 

when 
in 
reality 

I’ve made a joke 
or said something 
that’s been on my 
mind. Being soft-
spoken can make 
me doubt what I say.

I am an introvert.
I would much rather spend a day 

at the bookstore with my friends or 
spend time with my family than go to 
a party surrounded by new people.

I’m terrible at small talk. Often, I 

leave conversations realizing I forgot 
to ask how the other person was doing.

I can spend hours in my room 

alone just contemplating about the 
universe, and that’s when some of my 
best ideas are born. Sometimes they 
even creep up on me at night when 
everyone else is sleeping, amidst the 
silence of my house.

Recognizing that introversion is a 

personality trait that can manifest itself 
in various ways and is different from 
being shy or having social anxieties is 
important when interacting with peo-
ple on diverse sides of the spectrum.

People often think that introverts 

dislike talking to people and always 
need to be by themselves, but the 
reality is much more complex.

Extroverts feel most energized 

through interactions with other peo-

ple. Introverts, on the other hand, 
can get exhausted from too much 
social interaction and use time alone 
to rejuvenate. Ambiverts are some-
where in the middle of the spectrum 
between introverts and extroverts. 
These descriptions, however, don’t 
necessarily 
manifest 
themselves 

in ways that are exactly the same. 
Someone who’s introverted may seem 
like an extrovert because they’re out-
going, but really, they may find these 
interactions tiring.

The term introvert can come with a 

lot of baggage and misconceptions, as 
it is often misconstrued as being unso-
ciable or boring. Introverts may be 
told to “break out of their shell” and to 
act like extroverts — though it may go 
against their nature — simply because 
extroversion is seen as the norm.

When I was younger, people would 

often dismiss me because I am quiet, 
but being introverted empowers me to 
do spoken word poetry and speak out 
against human rights violations. Often, 
I find inspiration from seeing people 
with their stories left unheard because 
I can understand the feeling. I may find 
writing easier than speaking, but that 
can help make my spoken word better 
because the process starts on paper. 
I can perform in front of thousands 
of people without stuttering because 
when I perform, I focus on the impor-
tance of the words on paper and why I 
think they need to be heard.

In the age of technology, introverts 

are given more chances to express 
themselves. People can use plat-
forms, such as vlogging, to get their 
opinions across to viewers or use 
social media to connect with people 
who have similar interests. They can 

The induction of this package 

of bills into law only furthers a 
trend of legalized discrimina-
tion in Michigan. In addition to 
the statewide ban on gay mar-
riage — the legality of which 
is currently being deliberated 
in a case pending before the 
Supreme Court — Michigan’s 
legislature has yet to revise 
the severely outdated Elliot 
Larsen Civil Rights Act. As a 
result, protections for mem-
bers of the LGBTQ community 
continue to remain absent from 
the state’s anti-discrimination 
law. While the new adoption 
legislation certainly highlights 
the state’s inadequacies in pre-
venting discrimination against 
the 
LGBTQ 
community, 
a 

myriad of prospective parents 
— in addition to same-sex cou-
ples — can now be prohibited 
from adopting from certain 
agencies. Single individuals, 
unmarried couples and couples 
of different faiths may now be 

more easily rejected under the 
new statutes due to unfounded 
misconceptions 
surrounding 

children’s quality of life in non-
traditional homes.

According 
to 
Michigan’s 

Department of Health and 
Human Services, “approxi-
mately 3,000 Michigan fos-
ter children are available for 
adoption at any given time.” 
Denying these children the 
security and stability that 
could be provided to them by 
many capable parents who 
happen to be gay or unmar-
ried is counter to what these 
services are supposed to be 
for the children—to look out 
for them. Instead of evaluat-
ing prospective parents by the 
safety of their homes or their 
ability to care for children, 
these agencies have decided 
that extraneous factors, such 
as sexual orientation, should 
prohibit people from adop-
tive and foster parenthood, 

and even worse, the state has 
endorsed these practices. This 
is especially damaging to chil-
dren in light of a study that 
shows same-sex couples are 
four times more likely to raise 
adopted children and six times 
more likely to raise foster chil-
dren. Simply put, these laws 
don’t serve the best interest 
of the children the legislation 
pretends to protect.

The intent of the legislation 

is to protect religious free-
dom. The law seeks to pre-
vent “adverse action,” such 
as the removal of funding, 
against any adoption agency 
that could reject potential 
foster parents on religious 
grounds. However, anxieties 
about compromising beliefs 
don’t provide a viable excuse 
for legalized discrimination. 
Currently, similar legislation 
permitting denial of adoption 
services exists only in Virgin-
ia and North Dakota. Govern-

Introspections of an introvert

ments must seek to ensure citizens’ 
religious freedom, but it must not 
do so at the expense of those groups 
whose beliefs may differ. Therefore, 
a clear delineation must be drawn 
between the church and the state.

Two religious institutions, Beth-

any Christian Services and The 
Michigan Catholic Conference, who 
account for approximately 25 per-
cent of Michigan’s foster-care adop-
tions, advocated the passage of the 
bills by writing to Snyder and urging 
him to sign. The letters referenced 
scenarios in other states, such as 
Massachusetts and Illinois, where 
faith-based adoption agencies shut 
down in response to being forced 
to allow gay parents to adopt. They, 
likewise, strongly insinuated that 
scenario would repeat in Michigan 

if the legislation was not passed. Any 
law advocating discrimination must 
be repealed, especially when $10 
million of state and federal funding 
was allocated last year to faith-based 
adoption agencies who may cite this 
law in their future proceedings and 
parental candidate denials.

The passage of these laws high-

lights inherent flaws that must be 
reexamined in Michigan’s current 
adoption system, and by following 
these practices, the adoption agen-
cies are inhibiting their own sup-
posed institutional goals. If the newly 
passed laws continue to dictate adop-
tion proceedings, a sizable population 
of responsible parents who are eager 
and willing to provide good homes 
to Michigan’s foster children will be 
denied the opportunity to do so.

Fostering discrimination
 New legislation is discriminatory and damaging

L

ast Thursday, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed into law three bills 
that codify existing adoption practices of the Department of 
Health and Human Services in Michigan. The newly instated 

legislation ensures private faith-based adoption agencies, even those 
that receive state funding, can lawfully deny service to those seeking 
to adopt based on the agencies’ religious or moral beliefs. Although the 
agencies are required to refer clients denied for religious reasons to 
other adoption agencies, this does little to mitigate the damage caused 
by state-sponsored discrimination. These new adoption laws should 
be repealed, and the underlying framework for adoption in the state of 
Michigan should be reexamined. Michigan shouldn’t rely on the ser-
vices of agencies that are more concerned about conflicting religious 

ideologies than the overall welfare of the children in their care.


I

t all started, oddly enough, 
during the height of my 
French New Wave obsession. 

I was draining 
Godard 
and 

Truffaut films 
like diner cof-
fee on a rough 
Sunday morn-
ing. These are films that are 
compact, usually only an hour 
to an hour and 20 minutes long, 
and action-packed with a capital 
ACTION. High energy: car crash-
es, shootouts, existential shout-
ing matches about one’s place in 
society, infidelity and barely any 
plot whatsoever. One could tell 
Jean-Luc drank a healthy amount 
of caffeine while on set and writ-
ing scripts. I watched a movie 
entitled ‘Le Mepris’ (Contempt) 
four or five times, completely 
enthralled by the vices of the 
French moving picture.

This was a venture I took on 

alone. Friends — who weren’t 
that into film in general — 
weren’t going to sit down and 
watch a French one, that was for 
sure. Friends who did thought I 
was slightly pretentious in my 
selections, which was sort of 
understandable. I didn’t care. I 
just kept renting.

Finally, after walking into 

my apartment with another five 
movies of the francophonic per-
suasion, a roommate decided to 
ask me where I’d been obtaining 
and obtaining said films.

I said, “Askwith, man. I call it 

Five-Movie-Friday. They’re not 
due back until Monday at mid-
night. Isn’t that sweet?”

Outwardly not as amazed as I 

thought he should be, he merely 
blurted, “What is Askwith?”

“It’s the movie and media 

library in the UGLi. It’s free 
too. They have everything and 
a lot of it is on Criterion so you 
get all the essays and side stuff 
too. I joke all the time that I’m 
going to get my tuition back in 
movie rentals!”

Don’t worry, I’m aware of 

everything that’s wrong with 
this joke.

Then, my roommate made a 

most deep and existential inqui-
ry (I think the most mind-alter-
ing that he’s ever relayed to me 

in our brief time living together). 
He said, “Why is it called Ask-
with? Like, what are you ‘asking 
with?’ I don’t get it.”

Truly, I was stumped. I knew 

it was only one word. Askwith. 
What does that mean, though? 
Like so many of you would while 
sitting on the couch on a Friday 
night, I Googled it on my phone.

It turns out Askwith was 

named after the man who sup-
plied the funds that made the 
media library possible, Bert Ask-
with. Sadly, Bert Askwith recent-
ly passed away at the lofty age 
of 104 on June 1, but his accom-
plishments in life were lengthy. 
He was a University alumni and 
an editor of this very newspaper 
back in 1931. He started a trans-
portation company in 1928 called 
Campus Coach Lines that helped 
University students get home 
during school holidays.

Bert, what a familiar name, I 

thought. Yes, Askwith’s contri-
butions also helped create Bert’s 
Cafe in the UGLi where I just 
stopped to buy a coffee before I 
wrote this column on a library 
computer. With much gratitude, 
I am feeling Bert’s impact on the 
school with every sip.

But this was only the first 

domino to fall. Soon, every build-
ing on campus was subjected 
to this train of revelations and 
enlightenment. These words we 
use every day to meet up with 
our friends or to direct strang-
ers looking for the spinning cube, 
these words are names of people 
who actually lived and more 
often than not, attended the Uni-
versity, just like us. The light bulb 
is popping on. This may seem like 
a trivial or obvious observation, 
but it was shocking at the time, 
if not only due to the frequency 
with which I utilized these titles.

Tappan, 
Angell, 
Haven, 

Hutchins, Hatcher, Shapiro and 
Duderstadt were all presidents 
of the University. Burton Tower 
is named after President Marion 
LeRoy Burton. William L. Clem-
ents made his fortune supplying 
equipment for the construction 
of the Panama Canal. Stephen 
S. Clark Library is named after 
the man who co-invented the 
manometer having dual pressure 

sensors (which kind of sounds to 
me like some sub-surface weap-
onry wielded by Spongebob super 
villain Man Ray in a battle against 
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.) 
These are just the things I know.

But please forgive me. I wasn’t 

even at the University when he 
got the patents for these inven-
tions. For so many of these other 
honorable people, I wasn’t even 
born yet. Neither were my par-
ents or grandparents. So, this is 
more than a fun fact. This is the 
unveiling of the pre-me history 
that surrounds us. Or at least a 
history of some sort.

When you tell me something 

new about the library — a place 
where I spend so much time, 
that’s a part of so many of my 
stories, that’s now a part of who I 
am — the information is going to 
matter. It will strike my interest.

While it’s such a good time 

to acknowledge the historical 
process, I must admit that I’m 
fond of going the opposite way, 
too. The brightly-lit future. The 
future of me, in particular. I don’t 
think it is at all unreasonable to 
spend time with the successes 
of all these brilliant people and 
then to reflect on one’s own path-
way and journey in life. I can see 
myself now. I have no idea where 
my obsessions with the vices of 
French New Wave and laugh out 
loud oceanic animation will lead 
me, but I’m sure it will be to a 
very extraordinary accomplish-
ment worth millions. Then I, 
little old me, can give back to the 
place that made me who I am.

I will most likely contribute 

towards a theatre or an audito-
rium. 
Sparkman 
Auditorium. 

Or better yet, a whole complex 
full of Sparkman auditoria that 
thousands of freshman will take 
chemistry finals and fall asleep 
in during their Introduction to 
Linguistics courses. Maybe an 
improv group on campus will 
host a Friday night roast of who-
ever the current president is. 
The future can make it grandi-
ose and ornate or minimal and 
modern. I’m really, honestly sure 
I will love it either way.

Risk pays off in ‘OITNB’

TV REVIEW

Villianless Season 3 
fares well for Netflix 

original series

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

Season 3 of Netflix’s “Orange is 

the New Black” doesn’t designate a 
clear villain. Sure, every character 
has an adversary 
or two (“Orange 
is the New Black” 
is a drama series, 
and what’s drama 
without 
some 

good fights?), but 
character 
con-

flicts are more 
isolated this year, 
and 
no 
feuds 

spill 
from 
fac-

tion to faction like the ones with 
Pennsatucky and Vee in previous 
seasons. This time, “Orange is the 
New Black” is more interested in 
problematizing an abstract villain 
— authority figures.

Everyone is at the mercy of a 

malevolent higher-up, and Litch-
field’s guards and staff are no 
exception. Caputo (Nick Sandow, 
“Boardwalk Empire”) has to con-
tend with a patronizing new boss 
(Mike Birbiglia, “The Fault in Our 
Stars”) who claims he’s around 
to help Caputo and represent the 
inmates, but is clearly more inter-
ested in saving money and sat-
isfying his own boss. Birbiglia is 
brilliantly cast — he appears at first 
to be humble and well-intentioned, 
but his sweet smile transforms 
into a smarmy smirk faster than 
you can say, “I’m not the warden.” 
The incumbent correctional offi-
cers who answer to Caputo see 
their hours reduced and pay cut, 
and can’t protect their rights with-
out corporate’s cooperation. With 
their agency slashed to a corporate 
minimum, the guards are essen-
tially as powerless as the inmates. 
“Orange is the New Black” hadn’t 
given much screentime to its more 
benevolent guards in past seasons, 
so it’s great to see them utilized so 
seamlessly. 

The part-time guard system also 

exposes other cracks in the admin-
istrative system. While the expe-
rienced C.O.s were left to take on 
second jobs, the newbies proved 
themselves 
massively 
incompe-

tent — and often dangerous. Officer 
Coates (James McMenamin, “Olive 

Kitteridge”) is introduced as a hap-
less guard who lets Pennsatucky 
(Taryn Manning, “Sons of Anar-
chy”) show him the ropes of his 
new job, but he quickly turns terri-
fying as he exploits their burgeon-
ing friendship for something more 
sinister. Tragically, the administra-
tion wouldn’t believe Pennsatucky 
if she told anyone about what he did 
to her in the van; she wouldn’t have 
the “proof” that pregnant inmate 
Daya (Dascha Polanco, “Gimme 
Shelter”) did when she dealt with 
a similar assault. Manning plays 
these scenes with quiet heartbreak, 
and her flashback scenes in the sea-
son’s tenth episode fill in the details 
about this misunderstood charac-
ter.

Pennsatucky’s flashbacks, like 

all the best ones, inform who she 
is in the present — someone with a 
warped sense of a woman’s role in 
sex, who has rape so ingrained into 
her experience of relationships that 
she almost normalizes it. The other 
flashbacks this season mostly work, 
especially the episodes that spot-
light characters who viewers didn’t 
know much about before. New 
details about Big Boo (Lea DeLaria, 
“The Edge of Seventeen”), Flaca 
(Jackie Cruz, “The Shield”) and 
Chang (Lori Tan Chinn, “Glengarry 
Glen Ross”) pull these supporting 
characters from the periphery and 
give a heightened understanding of 
their place in Litchfield.

Certain other flashbacks are not 

as successful, because they don’t 
give any new information about the 
characters. The show has a long-
standing tradition of honoring its 
female inmates with flashbacks, 
but this season, “Orange is the New 
Black” dedicates flashbacks to three 
of the male prison employees. I’m 
all for expanding the scope of flash-
backs and exploring the nuance 
of other Litchfielders, but there’s 
no point wasting time searching 
for new information when we can 
glean everything from how these 
men interact with the prisoners. 
When a character’s actions in flash-
backs and the rest of the episode 
are so similar, like Bennett’s (Matt 
McGorry, “How to Get Away with 
Murder”) moral uncertainties dur-
ing his time in the military and 
fatherhood with Daya, the flash-
backs lose their poignancy. I thank 
the “Orange is the New Black” 
writer-gods for the opportunity to 
see Matt McGorry dance shirtless 
to “Hollaback Girl,” but otherwise, 

I’m not sure what I’m supposed to 
get out of that episode.

“Orange is the New Black” has 

been criticized for its heavy-handed 
introduction of Piper (Taylor Schil-
ling, “The Lucky One”) into the 
Litchfield action and for highlight-
ing her instead of more diverse (and 
more interesting) characters, but 
this season integrates her much 
more smoothly. Piper has always 
had a streak to her personality 
that enjoys organizing danger, and 
becoming the Vito Corleone of the 
prison panty business is the per-
fect way to employ the aspect of 
Piper that’s most compelling. Now, 
Piper functions as a character in 
the ensemble rather than the star 
of the show — and frankly, “Orange 
is the New Black” is much better off 
letting her take a smaller but more 
streamlined role.

But the season’s most successful 

risk was dismantling some of the 
barriers of race and gender that were 
holding up the walls of Litchfield. 
Sophia (Laverne Cox, “The Mindy 
Project”) has rarely had her gender 
identity questioned by the other 
inmates, but when she blames Glo-
ria’s (Selenis Leyva, “St. Vincent”) 
son for her own child’s sudden bad 
behavior, the fight turns personal. 
Gloria attacks Sophia with trans 
slurs, beats her and threatens her 
life. Sophia battles back with the 
resolve of a woman who has prob-
ably dealt with this shit too many 
times before, and Cox delivers a 
stunning performance that Emmy 
voters will certainly reward come 
September. Soso (Kimiko Glenn, 
“Hairbrained”) is depressed because 
she can’t make friends with the other 
inmates, but also because she doesn’t 
conform to any of the racial cliques 
at Litchfield. Like Sophia, her other-
ness is used as an excuse for abusive 
and cruel treatment by the inmates, 
and the administration’s interven-
tions do more harm than good. Past 
seasons have explored the construc-
tion of Litchfield’s racial cliques, but 
“Orange is the New Black” tells a 
powerful story by highlighting the 
difficulties for people who don’t fit 
neatly into those socially construct-
ed boxes.

Season 3 marks “Orange is the 

New Black” ’s riskiest venture yet, 
but also the one with the most pay-
off. By taking a break from the clear-
cut villain characters, the show 
exposes the darkness of authority, 
power and the convoluted systems 
that imprison these women.

The Ark’s 50th 
& Jeff Daniels

COMMUNITY CULTURE RECAP

By DANIELLE RAY

Daily Arts Writer

Maybe it was because I had just 

finished watching the series finale 
of “Breaking Bad” earlier in the 
day and was already drained from 
the emotional rollercoaster that is 
Walter White, Hank Schrader and 
Jesse Pinkman, but Jeff Daniels 
was a little too much for me. His 
set included everything from talk-
ing about colonoscopies (funny) 
to making fun of his “Dumb and 
Dumber” days (really funny) to 
singing a birthday ode to his wife 
(sweet) to discussing a song he 
wrote for a good friend who has 
since passed (rather depressing) 
to spending a good two to three 
minutes introducing Brad Phil-
lips, Daniels’ accompanist on sev-
eral different instruments, who is 
getting his doctoral degree at the 
University, and practically beg-
ging non-existent University HR 
reps to hire him (rather strange 
and awkward).

Daniels’ show was arranged to 

commemorate the 50th anniver-
sary of The Ark, and after a some-
what lengthy introduction by The 
Ark staff, they reached the main 
point: Daniels donated his fee to 
their fundraising campaign. This 
was obviously made a big deal of, 
and when Daniels came out, he 
started his show strong, making a 
crack about not only donating his 
fee, but also his sperm at the local 
sperm bank. The first 20 minutes 
of his show were spectacular — 
this is when all the funny came out 
(perhaps it was all he had in him). 
He would play a line or two of his 
opening song and then seemingly 
interrupt himself with those ran-
dom thoughts about colonosco-
pies (apparently he’s already had 
two!) and “Dumb and Dumber,” 
although I’m sure it was all actu-
ally scripted.

Before I continue, though, I 

must say, there’s no doubt Jeff 
Daniels is extremely talented. 
Apart from his magnificent work 
as an actor in “The Newsroom,” 
“Good Night, and Good Luck.” 
and, let’s face it, “101 Dalmations,” 
he is also a very talented musician. 
His guitar work was flawless, his 
voice was smooth but growly at 
the same time, he really seemed 

to understand and feel the blues 
influences apparent in his work 
and his comedy songs were hilari-
ous, including one he wrote as a 
tribute to Dave Letterman, which 
detailed a couple having sex every 
night while watching Letterman’s 
show: “How much fun the three of 
us had.”

Where it went wrong was the 

rest of the set, namely the song 
for his deceased friend. One of 
Daniels’ strong suits was that he 
gave a great introduction to all 
of his songs, which really made 
you understand why he wrote 
them and what inspired him. He 
gave a lengthy synopsis of how he 
wrote this song from a poem his 
deceased friend had written and 
how he sang it to his friend on his 
deathbed. It was quite touching. 
But, coming from a completely 
unserious beginning to land in a 
pool of sadness was quite the turn. 
The song, called “Roadsigns,” was 
beautifully written and quite the 
masterpiece, but it was difficult to 
enjoy it after thinking about Jeff 
Daniels shitting to high heaven in 
preparation for his colonoscopy. 
“Roadsigns” was also shortly fol-
lowed by “Big Bay Shuffle,” a song 
about two drunk women Daniels 
met in a bar at 11 a.m. in the Upper 
Peninsula. Having been to Big Bay, 
I wasn’t surprised.

Daniels implied throughout the 

night that he wanted his set to be 
representative of life itself, and I 
suppose he did that. One minute 
you’re crapping your pants from 
sadness, and the next you’re pee-
ing them from laughter. But maybe 
art shouldn’t always imitate life 
exactly. I just wish he would have 
picked one direction to go in or the 
other; “Breaking Bad” already had 
me feeling some type of way.

It’s also perhaps true that I 

didn’t get a feeling of cohesiveness 
from his set because I was prob-
ably the youngest person in the 
room by about 20 years.

The set ended approximately 

with a love ballad to Michigan 
and The Ark. The song itself was 
rather sleepy, although I could 
definitely see it appearing on a 
Pure Michigan commercial. Pure 
Michigan: The Home of Jeff Dan-
iels, and many more, but mainly 
Jeff Daniels.

Capitalism trumps caution in ‘Jurassic’ 

Third sequel isn’t 
more than a decent 

action movie

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Snapping 
necks 
and 
cashing 

checks. “Jurassic World” did a lot of 
both over its opening weekend, featur-
ing dinosaur deaths by 
the dozen and eclips-
ing domestic and inter-
national 
box-office 

records for an opening 
weekend.

The fourth film in 

the “Jurassic” fran-
chise resembles Steven 
Spielberg’s original in 
many ways. The key 
difference 
between 

the two films — that in 
“Jurassic World” the park is actually 
open — creates an intriguing dynamic 
that was only hypothetical in previous 
films. This isn’t a visionary, seeking 
counsel from top paleontologists; this 

is a monstrous new dinosaur made 
with a cocktail of genetics from vari-
ous predators — and it’s loose on an 
island filled with more than 20,000 
guests. 

Among those guests are two broth-

ers, since no “Jurassic” film can be 
without the child-in-peril aspect to the 
story. Gray (Ty Simpkins, “Insidious”) 
is the film’s innocent youth: about 10 
years old and on the edge of his seat for 
every dinosaur. Zach (Nick Robinson, 
“The Kings of Summer”) is his older 
brother, a teenage angst-bot oozing 
repressed sexual energy. Zach treats 
Gray like garbage, which the film 
makes a point of often and unneces-
sarily. Both characters are rather flat, 
which makes it hard to care a great 
deal for either of them.

Isla Nublar, the fictional island 

home to Jurassic World, may not 
be in the U.S., but it is in Central 
America. And Central America is 
America, dammit. And where there’s 
America, there’s someone trying to 
weaponize something. In this case, it’s 
head of security Vic Hoskins (Vincent 
D’Onofrio, “Full Metal Jacket”), who 

wants velociraptors trained for mili-
tary use. It’s a subplot that can’t carry 
out on the scale it deserves, but it offers 
the kind of fresh perspective needed 
in a third sequel, and makes for one 
hell of a lock-and-load sequence.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect 

of the plot is the question of meddling 
with dinosaurs’ genetics to produce 
“cooler” attractions for mass audi-
ences. At odds here are capitalism’s 
demand for continued growth and 
caution in the face of playing God. At 
this level, capitalism always triumphs 
over caution. As Dr. Wu (B.D. Wong, 
“Jurassic Park”) explains, they’ve 
been playing God all along, it’s only 
catching up to them now.

Science brought the dinosaurs back, 

but the main attraction of “Juras-
sic World” is raptor-wrangler Owen 
Grady (Chris Pratt, “Guardians of the 
Galaxy”). Tough but compassionate, 
rugged but refined, Owen is pure good-
guy in a film that never emphasizes 
character depth. Owen shows respect 
for these creatures as living beings, not 
just theme-park attractions or weap-
ons. He’s enlisted to save Zach and 

Gray, nephews of park manager Claire 
(Bryce Dallas Howard, “The Help”), 
as well as track down the hybrid beast, 
Indominus Rex. Oh, and there’s a 
love story between Owen and Claire, 
though that’s not really important.

There are some truly wonderful ele-

ments to “Jurassic World”: the sound 
of a dinosaur’s heavy step played over 
a close-up of a bird’s foot is a genius 
nugget of filmmaking; little kids riding 

baby triceratops sets a new standard 
for cuteness in dinosaur movies. The 
action sequences pack appropriate 
punch, and homages paid to “Jurassic 
Park” are frequent, but done in meth-
ods more reverent than exploitative.

While cheesy lines of dialogue and 

underdeveloped characters prevent 
“Jurassic World” from being more than 
just an action movie, it’s a damn decent 
action movie.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

People love to hate Madonna. I 

know this firsthand, seeing as my 
mother loves to hate Madonna … 
and that was 
probably 
my 

biggest reason 
for loving the 
queen of pop. 

While 
I 

would normal-
ly argue bitch, 
she’s 
Madon-

na any time 
mother dear-
est voiced her 
disdain, 
this 

time, like most times, mom’s right.

We’ve been privy to the long-

anticipated video via Tidal teas-
ers and Instagram, with colorful, 
punchy fan art and videos from 
both Madonna and Nicki Minaj. 
Apparently, that, along with fea-
turing an array of A-listers in 
music videos, is a thing now (see: 
Taylor Swift, “Bad Blood”). But 
when Taylor did it, we didn’t lose 
our focus — we were enthralled 
with both the theatrical tale and 
the true star, Swift. Pause: The 
fact that Madonna even attempt-
ed to imitate this is both confus-
ing and out of character, seeing as 

she used to set the bar that others 
aspired to. Madge’s take on the 
trend poses no storyline, aside 
from debauchery featuring sock 
puppets. In short, she’s forget-
table and she’s outshined by the 
sum of star-studded cameos.

While she’s undeniably savvy 

in her attempts of capitalizing on 
the current zeitgeist — a video 
exclusively for Tidal users fea-
tures not only music moguls (in 
order of importance: Beyoncé, 
Nicki, Kanye, Miley, Diplo, Katy 
Perry and Rita Ora), but also front-
runner fashion designers Jeremy 
Scott and Alexander Wang — the 
weight of her guests’ combined 
energies and cultural significance 

rivals, if not tops, Madonna’s.

Though age is relative in 

most cases, it’s time Madonna 
starts acting accordingly to hers. 
We know her body says she’s a 
30-something crossfit junkie, but 
her career speaks for itself, being 
that of a longstanding innova-
tor in an industry that thrives on 
freshness. She was shiny and new 
at one point, continuing to main-
tain her signature ingenuity for 
decades, and “Bitch, I’m Madon-
na” was the creed that established 
this. But, Madonna, this video 
pushes my love over the border-
line, and I’ve gotta agree with 
mom on this one.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com SPORTS

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

It was mid-morning, and Sheryl 

Szady turned on the television in 
her Oklahoma City hotel. Footage 
of the Michigan baseball coach, 
Erik Bakich, was replaying from an 
earlier press conference.

In the days before, the Michigan 

baseball team, notable underdogs, 
had won its first Big Ten Tourna-
ment under Bakich’s watch but 
had fallen short in the Louisville 
Regional of the NCAA Tourna-
ment.

Szady tuned in as Bakich’s 

speech reemphasized one of his 
goals for the program.

“Look at softball’s success,” 

Szady recalls Bakich saying. “Look 
at Hutch, what she does with her 
players. There’s no reason that 
baseball can’t be just that good.”

Accentuating the success of 

Michigan softball coach Carol 
Hutchins, “Hutch” to those who 
know her, is something Bakich has 
done since day one. When then-
Athletic Director Dave Brandon 
hired him to take over the base-
ball team in 2012, he addressed the 
media in a similar fashion.

“We’ve got to catch Hutch,” 

Bakich said in his inaugural press 
conference. “Hutch has set the bar. 
The softball program gives me tre-
mendous optimism of what base-
ball can do here, and not just do it 
once in a while, but do it on a con-

sistent level. She is someone I’ve 
enjoyed meeting, and I’m looking 
forward to spending time with and 
picking her brain on exactly how 
she does it.”

If chasing softball was Bakich’s 

plan, then he had another accom-
plishment to pursue on Sunday 
evening of May 31. After the Car-
dinals halted the baseball team’s 
Cinderella run, another Michigan 
team was on the brink of rising to 
exceptional heights.

All eyes turned to Oklahoma 

City, where the softball team — a 
trailblazer for Wolverine athlet-
ics — took down LSU that same 
day. The victory against the Tigers 
merited a spot in the National 
Championship.

Baseball, in Bakich’s eyes, was 

laying down the groundwork 
to reach softball’s prominence, 
a group that for the last three 
decades has been one of Michi-
gan’s most consistent. A team 
that, when both compete on the 
same day, draws more fans to the 
bleachers because Hutchins, who 
has more wins than any other 
coach in the University’s his-
tory, built the program into one 
of Michigan’s greatest. And when 
the Wolverines came so close to 
capturing their second National 
Championship, the Great Lakes 
State watched more than any-
where else in the country.

Baseball didn’t garner the spot-

light, so Bakich was right. The 

baseball team needed to, and still 
must, catch up to softball. Right 
now, the women of the Wilpon 
Complex bear the torch, and the 
men lag behind.

And Sheryl Szady was elated, 

because 40 years ago, when she 
suited up for Michigan’s first varsity 
women’s basketball and field hockey 
teams, the paradigm couldn’t have 
looked more different.

“I was in my hotel room going, 

‘Yes, finally! They’re striving to be 
what we are.’ ”

***

Foraging through the Michi-

gan archives, one would be hard-

pressed to find the names Liz 
Eagan and Sheryl Szady. The for-
mer only appears once, and the lat-
ter just twice.

The 
pair, 
longtime 
friends, 

began their athletic careers in 1973 
playing for Michigan field hockey’s 
“Team One,” and even though their 
statistics are virtually impossible 
to dig up, the foundation they tilled 
for future female athletes at Michi-
gan was exceptional.

Szady and Eagan were given 

the opportunity to play collegiate 
sports, at the varsity level, because 
of the enactment and implemen-
tation of Title IX. The law is a 
portion of the United States Edu-
cation Amendments of 1972 that 
declares 
that 

no person, on 
the basis of sex, 
can be excluded 
from 
an 
edu-

cational 
pro-

gram. Title IX, 
which 
applies 

to far more than 
athletics, 
was 

passed in 1972, but the guidelines 
for compliance in terms collegiate 
sports were not immediately laid 
out.

After the law was passed, Szady 

and her future basketball team-
mate Linda Laird began to cam-
paign for the actual creation of 
women’s varsity teams. At first, 
the University was remiss, ignor-
ing their requests.

The athletic director at the 

time, Don Canham, was outward-
ly unsupportive. Szady remem-
bers Canham challenging her and 
Laird. He said, “Who will you 
play? We have no money to trav-
el.” At the time, while their teams 
remained at the club level, Szady 
and Eagan were chipping in to pay 
for their own coaches. 

Otherwise, they were staffed by 

volunteers. The expenses of travel 
for women’s sports were beyond 
them.

In April of 1973, the University 

had yet to create women’s varsity 
teams despite Title IX’s passage 
nearly a year before, so Szady and 
Laird went to the University’s 
Board of Regents to campaign.

Canham wasn’t thrilled, but 

Szady and Laird finally got the 
answer they wanted.

“Yes, we’re going to start this 

program,” then-University Presi-
dent Robben Wright Fleming, also 
an ex-officio member of the board, 
told Szady and Laird.

At last it had been pronounced, 

signed and sealed, the dawn of 

women’s 
var-

sity 
sports 
at 

Michigan 
had 

begun. But the 
journey to top, to 
the place Szady 
wanted to reach, 
would take time.

“We 
always 

dreamed to be 

equal or have the same benefits and 
opportunities as the men,” Szady 
said.

But by the way things seemed 

in the mid-70’s, catching up to the 
benefits the men were afforded 
seemed centuries away. Women’s 
athletics at Michigan then weren’t 
characterized by what was avail-
able to them, but by what wasn’t. 
Over 40 years later, Eagan and 
Szady remember the first season, 
when the field hockey team played 
at Michigan Stadium.

There was no athletic training, 

no stretching, no pregame music, 
no meals or anything of that mat-
ter. At halftime, they didn’t go 
into the locker rooms at the Big 
House.

They stayed outside because they 

were not given access to the com-
fort of indoor locker rooms or any of 
the amenities the football team was 
pampered with.

“We were just talking about this 

at dinner,” Szady said in Oklahoma. 
“Liz (Eagan) pulled out a picture of 
us at halftime of a field hockey game, 
and we were playing at Michigan 
Stadium. We’re all just sitting on 
the ground, eating cut-up oranges 
that we had brought. The coach was 
standing up, leaning over and talk-
ing to us as we were sprawled out on 
the sideline. Vastly different.”

In 2015, change is evident. The 

field hockey team doesn’t linger on 
the sidelines of an empty Big House; 
it plays at the newly renovated Phyl-
lis Ocker Field — a 1,500-seat home 
of its own.

After the 2013 construction 

of the field hockey-specific sta-
dium, Team 40 owned the turf, 
but Team One returned. Thirteen 
of the original 15 members from 
the inaugural field hockey team 
came back to Ann Arbor, and their 
tour of the new facilities left them 
amazed.

“We were going through the train-

ing rooms and they’ve got the ice bath 
and the hot tubs,” Eagan said.

“We said we could stay over night 

here in this building!” Szady added.

“And someone launders the uni-

forms,” Eagan added, as the two 
bounced back-and-forth off each 
other’s memories. “They have plac-
es to put their shoes to dry. And 
they’ve got shoes! We had to buy our 
own stuff.”

“They’ve got locker rooms!” 

Szady 
responded. 
“We 
didn’t 

have locker rooms. We didn’t 

have shoes. When we played field 
hockey, we played for a two-month 
season, where these kids are doing 
it all year round, and they’re on 
scholarships. We didn’t have schol-
arships. We only had one coach, 
I don’t think we had manager or 
anything like that.”

Baths, laundry, locker rooms 

and shoes. Guaranteed provisions 
to modern Division I athletes, but 
five-star accommodations to field 
hockey players in the 1970s. Get-
ting from point A to point B took 40 
years; it was a slow progression, but 
a successful evolution nonetheless. 
The resources available to Michi-
gan’s field hockey players today 
match the best in the world.

The team started with practi-

cally no resources. Now they have 
them, and they are consequentially 
successful. Piecing together the 
puzzle from the last 40 years of the 
sport is complex. The team wasn’t 
immediately prominent on a nation-
al level, but four decades changed 
everything.

After eight regular season con-

ference championships, five Big 
Ten Tournament championships, 
three trips to the Final Four and 
one national title, it’s safe to say that 
the Michigan field hockey team has 
caught up.

***

Field hockey wasn’t her only 

sport, but Sheryl Szady’s time on 
the court revives similar memories.

Forty-six years after its open-

ing, the Crisler Center underwent 
massive renovations prior to the 
2012-2013 basketball season. A 
few months later, the University 
rededicated the arena and invited 
back many former athletes for 
the ceremony, Szady being one of 

them.

Part of the rededication, which 

was held during a men’s basketball 
game against Penn State, consisted 
of a montage of pictures and vid-
eos throughout the decades since 
Crisler’s opening. But when the 
committee organizing the event 
reached out to Szady requesting 
photos of her playing basketball, her 
answer was blunt.

“No. There was no media,” Szady 

said. “There were some pictures 
from when we were playing Michi-
gan State, and I might be in one of 
those pictures, from their media, 
but we had no coverage.”

The first handful of women’s 

basketball games were never adver-
tised in The Ann Arbor News or 
The Michigan Daily. There weren’t 
thousands of fans flocking down 
into the lower bowl when Szady and 
her teammates entered through the 
north tunnel. No photographers or 
reporters huddled into the press 
boxes and conference rooms after 
games.

There were maybe 15 people 

watching.

At that time, the only person 

that covered Michigan women’s 
sports was Szady’s college room-
mate, Leslie Riester, who joined 
the Daily because nobody would 
write about women’s teams other-
wise. When Riester wrote a feature 
on the deplorable conditions under 
which the women’s basketball team 
played, it made the front page, one 
of the first mentions of the team in 
the public media.

Though, the first time that any 

women’s varsity competition was 
mentioned in the Daily, the field 
hockey team was given a single sen-
tence, written by Riester.

“Michigan’s women’s field hock-

ey team bowed to Western Michi-
gan last night in Kalamazoo, 2-0. 
Michigan’s coach was proud with 
her team’s performance due to the 
superlative competition.”

A quoteless, imageless, one-by-

two inch description was all the 
Wolverines had to show for their 
inaugural Michigan Daily recap, 
and Riester wasn’t even given a 
byline. Few were interested in 
reading 
about 

women’s sports, 
and even fewer 
were 
deter-

mined to write 
about them.

But 
since 

Title IX origi-
nated, women’s 
sports, 
espe-

cially 
at 
the 

college 
level, 

have 
progres-

sively climbed toward the pedestal 
of fandom and media appreciation 
the men embrace. Discussing the 
opportunities available to female 
athletes in comparison to males 
begins to feel irrelevant, almost 
obsolete, because of the manner 
by which women’s sports are now 
received. In Oklahoma City, this 
trend was evident.

The 
2015 
Women’s 
College 

World Series didn’t attempt to make 
a statement about gender equality, 
but it did show how far women’s 
sports have come in the public eye. 
It was treated, celebrated and expe-
rienced like any other — men’s or 
women’s.

The World Series wasn’t about 

gender. It was about athletes. And 
first team All-Americans. It was 
about Michigan. Florida. Two of the 

best softball players in history duel-
ing on the game’s biggest stage.

A 
passerby 
never 
could’ve 

noticed women’s sports once trailed 
behind.

Szady and Eagan remember that 

time — when men overshadowed 
in all realms. That has passed. 
It’s measurable in some aspects, 
immeasurable in other, but if 
women’s sports haven’t yet caught 
up, the gap becomes narrower 

every day.

Earlier 
this 

month, 
78,078 

fans from around 
the world cara-
vanned 
to 
the 

Sooner State to 
witness the great-
est softball play-
ers in the world. 
It was a tourna-
ment of power-
houses, built by 

fundamentally flawless lineups.

These renowned athletes don’t 

live for a time when any person 
could walk into a barren Michigan 
Stadium to find the field hockey 
team sitting on the ground eating 
orange slices. They work for a time 
when reserving a season ticket 
becomes a necessity, when a cher-
ished chair-back seat becomes an 
expensive treasure.

Perhaps in the next few years, 

Erik Bakich will lead a flourishing 
Michigan baseball team to the Col-
lege World Series. If softball stum-
bles, maybe then, Carol Hutchins 
will flip the script.

“We’ve got to catch Bakich,” she 

might say.

But “catching up” won’t be about 

evening the playing field. It will be 
about succeeding on it.

Ofili headlines strong NCAA 
Championship performances

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Editor

When junior hurdler Cindy Ofili 

sprinted past the finish line, she 
knew she had done well.

Michigan coach James Henry 

knew she had it in her. But before 
the race, neither knew just how 
impressive the finishing time would 
be. Ofili recorded a 12.60-second 
result — a full .21 seconds faster 
than her previous personal record, 
set just two days before.

“When I was running, my goal 

was purely to win,” Ofili said. “I 
knew crossing that line that I had 
given it my all, so to be honest, I 
wasn’t too surprised that I had 
broken my personal record. I knew 
this was in me, I just didn’t know 
that was in me.”

Added Henry: “She works very 

hard, and as a coach you learn to 
know the kids and their numbers. 
I was surprised it was this signifi-
cant of an improvement, even if she 
is at this level where I knew she 
would improve.”

Her 
record-breaking 
time 

earned her a second-place finish 
at the NCAA Outdoor Champion-
ships in Eugene, Oregon

this past weekend — the best 

Wolverine finish at the event since 
2009. But much more than that, 
Ofili’s time shattered Michigan’s 
previous record — set by Ofili’s 
older sister, Tiffany Ofili-Porter — 
by .13 seconds.

Despite this, Tiffany — a sister 

before a competitor — congratulat-
ed Ofili and showed excitement for 
Ofili’s future running career.

“I am literally in tears right now! 

I’m over the moon for my sis @
cindyofili!!! I’m soooooooo proud 
of her!! #Beast,” she tweeted after 
the race.

Ofili’s performance in the 100-

meter hurdles would secure her 
place in history among the program’s 
elite, but she one-upped herself with 
a second school record in the 100-
meter dash — crossing the finish line 
in 11.39 seconds. Though the time 
wasn’t fast enough to advance to the 
finals, it did warrant an All-Ameri-
can honorable mention.

Consider-

ing 
that 
the 

qualifying 100-
meter dash was 
just under 15 
minutes 
after 

her 100-meter 
qualifying hur-
dles race, it was 
an 
impressive 

result for Ofili.

In total, Ofili 

completed the 
season with four school records 
in the indoor 60-meter and 200-
meter events, and the outdoor 100-
meter dash and 100-meter hurdles.

And she still has one more year 

to leave her mark on the program.

“I definitely want to be a nation-

al champion (before I graduate),” 
Ofili said. “I want to break more 
personal records. I want to just 
improve. Even though I executed 
a really great couple of races, it 
wasn’t perfect. I definitely have 
more to give and I want to do that 
in my final year.”

Michigan finished in 19th place 

with 14 points, the highest they’ve 
placed since 2009 when they 
earned seventh place.

Three other Wolverines quali-

fied: sophomore Erin Finn quali-
fied in the 5,000-meter run, 
and both redshirt junior Shan-
non Osika and senior co-captain 
Brooke Handler received bids in 
the 1,500-meter race.

However, due to a lower-left leg 

injury, Osika was unable to compete.

“(Osika) wanted to run and she 

wanted to compete and she would 
have done well,” Henry said. “But 

this is a perfect 
example 
of 
an 

athlete doing out-
standing in cross 
country and fan-
tastic in winter 
but wearing out 
towards the end 
of 
the 
outdoor 

season. 
She’s 

human and she’s 
not a robot, she 
needs rest and her 

body just gave way.”

In her last meet donning the 

maize and blue, Handler represent-
ed Michigan in the 1,500-meter 
race and crossed the finish line at 
4:16.19 to place seventh and receive 
her second-consecutive first team 
All-American honor.

“Handler has always been moti-

vated,” said Michigan associate 
head coach Mike McGuire. “She’s 
stayed healthy and she’s just 
grown through training physical-
ly and mentally. This is a byprod-
uct of what’s she’s put in. It’s a 
maturity process.”

Added Henry: “We bring them 

in, we mature them, we develop 
them, and even-
tually we have to 
graduate them.”

McGuire— 

who has worked 
with 
Henry 

since they were 
teammates 
in 

college— 
has 

had at least one 
All-American in the 1,500-meter 
since 2012.

Finn rounded out the middle-

distance runners and became 
the first Wolverine to receive 
All-American honors in both the 
5,000-meter 
and 
10,000-meter 

events. She finished in fifth place 
with a time of 15:43.97.

Finn had sustained an injury 

earlier this year, leaving her unable 
to compete for the majority of the 

season. But according to her team-
mates and coaches, it was her com-

petitive 
streak 

that allowed her 
to still find suc-
cess.

This weekend 

concluded Mich-
igan’s 2014-2015 
campaign, 
and 

Henry was satis-
fied with the way 

his Wolverines wrapped up the 
season. But that satisfaction won’t 
turn into complacency.

“We ended on such a high note, 

which is what we wanted,” Henry 
said. “I always say ‘last meet best 
meet,’ which was a reality this 
weekend. We understand that 
what happens today ends today 
and tomorrow we start prepping 
for next year. But only after the 
kids get a significant rest.”

CONNOR BADE/Daily

Junior sprinter Cindy Ofili set two school records and took second place in the 100-meter hurdles, beating her sister’s record.

“I definitely 
want to be 
a national 
champion.”

“We ended on 

such a high 

note.”

By TYLER SCOTT 

Daily Sports Writer

It had been only one week since the 

end of the Women’s College World 
Series, but Sierra Romero already 
found herself back in Oklahoma City.

In her junior season, the Michigan 

second baseman cemented herself as 
one of college softball’s top talents 
and a leader of the NCAA runner-
up Michigan softball team. Now she 
has assumed a new role. Romero was 
named to the 2015 Women’s Nation-
al Team in January, and she has 
returned to Oklahoma City for train-
ing camp with Team USA, which 
spans the second week of June.

“Making the Women’s National 

Team is something I’ve always 
dreamt 
about,” 
Romero 
told 

MGoBlue.com in January. “It’s 
such an honor that I will have the 
opportunity to represent the USA 
this summer.”

The two-time NFCA All-Amer-

ican also spent the summer of 2013 
playing on the Junior Women’s 
National Team, but this will be 
her first experience on the offi-
cial National Team roster. Romero 
joins former Wolverine Amanda 
Chidester, a 2012 Michigan gradu-
ate, and her younger sister Sydney, 
an incoming Oklahoma freshman 
and Junior Women’s National Team 
member.

“I am so grateful for the opportu-

nity and for being to play with such 
amazing athletes as we go for the 
gold,” Romero told MGoBlue.com. 
“To top it off, I’ll get to travel with 
my little sister Sydney. I’m extremely 
blessed for the opportunity and look 
forward to making the most of it.”

So far, Romero has capitalized 

on all of her chances for success in 
softball. In three years as a short-
stop and second baseman for the 
Wolverines, she owns several pro-
gram records with a full season 
still left to play. She already boasts 
the most home runs of any Michi-
gan softball player, the program 
record for total RBI and the NCAA 
record for grand slams.

During her junior campaign, 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
worked to further shape Romero 
as a leader. Despite her many acco-
lades, 
Hutchins 

maintains 
that 

Romero’s legacy 
will be judged 
based 
on 
the 

accomplishments 
of her team. The 
veteran 
coach 

has 
repeatedly 

referred to former New York Yankee 
Derek Jeter as a model for the type of 
player she wants Romero to be.

The season-long challenge for 

Romero to grow from a talented 
young player to a leader was largely 
successful. Hutchins named Rome-
ro team captain for her junior sea-
son and she adapted to the role, even 
if it took some time.

“(Hutchins) talked about how 

(Jeter) elevates everyone around 
him to be better and do better,” 
Romero 
said 
after 
Michigan’s 

WCWS win over Alabama. “That’s 
what I focused on this year. It took 
me awhile to understand what that 
meant, but I found a way to put all 
my focus on my teammates.”

Of the 16 players on the Team 

USA roster, Romero is one of just 
six still in college, meaning that 
Romero will have the entire sum-

mer to learn from the older veterans 
before she returns to Ann Arbor for 
her senior season.

After training camp ends on June 

13, Team USA begins a two-week 
period of away exhibition games 
before heading to Irvine, California 
to compete in the tenth World Cup of 
Softball beginning June 29. Both the 
USA National and Junior National 
teams will compete against each 
other, in addition to facing ball clubs 
from Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, 
Argentina, Venezuela and Japan.

Team 
USA 

will then play 
a slate of Pan 
American games 
across 
Canada 

through late July. 
Before wrapping 
up the summer, 
the 
Women’s 

National Team will travel to Ogaki, 
Japan to compete for the Japan Cup 
in August.

Romero has her eyes set on gold. 

She’s made it to Team USA and has 
less than a month before having 
another chance to fulfill another 
goal. And by mid-August, she’ll be 
heading back to Ann Arbor, where 
the Wolverines say the goals never 
change. Led by their second base-
man, the Michigan softball team 
will be striving to reach the WCWS 
again. If that happens, Romero 
would close out her college career 
with her third trip to Oklahoma City 
in four years.

There are still some boxes left 

to be checked on Romero’s already 
prestigious résumé, but her pur-
suit of those accomplishments will 
begin this summer when she dons 
the red, white and blue.

Junior second baseman Sierra Romero was back in Oklahoma City after the season ended with the Women’s National Team.

Wagner going pro

The drive from Ann Arbor to 

Pennsylvania is just six hours of 
Midwestern Highway. One week 
after the Women’s College World 
Series, Haylie Wagner set out on 
that route, ready to begin the third 
iteration of her softball career.

“I knew that I wasn’t ready to 

be done playing after (my career 
at) Michigan,” Wagner said. “Once 
Michigan closed so suddenly – it 
was over so quick – I knew I want-
ed to continue playing.”

The Friday after Michigan’s 

loss to Florida in the WCWS 
Championship 
Series, 
team 

officials from the Pennsylva-
nia Rebellion contacted Michi-
gan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins. 

Wagner went undrafted in the 
2015 National Pro Fastpitch Col-
lege Draft, but Pennsylvania was 
offering a chance to sign as a 
free-agent. 

On June 9th, Wagner signed 

her first PFL contract with the 
Rebellion and is now available 
to play in the team’s three-game 
series against the Dallas Charge 
this week. The left-hander leaves 
Michigan’s program with a 100-
18 career record from inside the 
circle. Her .847 win percentage is 
third all-time amongst Wolverine 
pitchers.

Now Wagner is entering a new 

role, and she’s still transitioning to 
life on the professional circuit.

“Going into playing with the 

Rebellion, I need to remember to 
still have fun,” Wagner said. “Just 
because it’s more of a business 
type now, and it’s a little bit dif-
ferent. I don’t really know any of 
the girls so I feel like I’m a fresh-
man again, but I just have to go 
out and play softball.”

Before her contract with the 

Rebellion 
officially 
activated, 

Wagner was with the team, but 
unable to pitch in games. That 
gave Wagner the downtime to 
reflect on her senior season at 
Michigan.

The philosophies of Hutchins 

still resonate with Wagner as she 
prepares for the third step in her 
softball journey. It’s the words 
of her former coach that will 
remain as some of her strongest 
influences.

“Hutch has changed me,” Wag-

ner said. “Without Hutch, I don’t 
know what I’d do these last four 
years. I wouldn’t be playing for 
the Rebellion without her. I want 
to make her proud. And I know 
that she’ll be following me along 
the way. And I’m just going to do 
whatever I can. Not just to rep-
resent myself and the Rebellion, 
but also represent Michigan and 
Hutch.”

SOFTBALL

“I’m extremely 

blessed.”
