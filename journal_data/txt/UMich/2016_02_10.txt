State representaive 

aims to reduce 

expenses for college 

students

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

In an effort reduce the cost 

of college, state Rep. Robert 
Kosowski (D–Westland) intro-
duced a bill to the Michigan legis-
lature that would exempt college 
textbooks from the 6-percent 
state sales tax.

The 
proposed 
legislation, 

House Bill 5309, would eliminate 
the tax from textbooks for col-
lege students who purchase them 
with a valid student identification 
card.

In an interview with the Mich-

igan Daily, Kosowski said his 
primary motivation for introduc-
ing this bill was to help students 
save money while going through 
school.

According to estimates from 

the College Board, students at 
public 
four-year 
institutions 

spend an average of $1,298 on 
textbooks and school supplies 
each year. The University’s Office 
of Financial Aid recommends 
University 
students 
allocate 

$1,048 per year for books and 
supplies.

Kosowski 
said 
his 
office’s 

research found that the average 
cost of textbooks to a student is 
$1,300, Kosowski said.

“1,300 dollars is a lot of money 

for a college student, if we can 
save them even $78 of that, it’s a 
positive thing,” Kosowski said.

Kosowski said his office did a 

study in Maryland, a state that 
also has a 6-percent sales tax and 
numerous colleges, which deter-
mined the state collects about 
$7 million each year in textbook 
sales tax revenue. Kosowski said 
this number would be relatively 
similar to what could be expected 
in Michigan with a textbook sales 
tax exemption.

The small decrease in tax rev-

enue would be negligible, and 

Demonstrators 

connect Flint water 
crisis to Black Lives 
Matter movement

By RIYAH BASHA and 

CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporters

Nearly 100 protesters gath-

ered outside Hutchins Hall and 
marched to the Diag on Tuesday 

afternoon, pushing for a recall of 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in light of 
the Flint water crisis. The pro-
testers marched across campus 
shouting multiple chants includ-
ing “Flint Lives Matter” and 
“Black Lives Matter.”

A coalition of organizations 

including the Ann Arbor-Flint 
Solidarity Network and the Ann 
Arbor Alliance For Black Lives 
initially organized the protest in 
response to a panel on Detroit’s 
bankruptcy hosted by the Uni-

versity’s Law School that was set 
to feature Snyder, however, The 
Law School indefinitely post-
poned the event last week, but 
protestors still decided to have 
the protest. 

LSA senior Cassandra Van 

Dam, an Ann Arbor-Flint Soli-
darity Network organizer, said 
she 
believes 
pressure 
from 

protesters motivated the Law 
School’s decision. 

“Snyder is humiliated,” she 

said. “It is clear that, had the 

event gone on, it would have 
been disrupted and he would 
have had to answer to the 
human rights violations that 
he and his administration have 
committed against the people of 
Michigan.”

“The 
Detroit 
bankruptcy 

event was postponed because 
its organizers don’t wish to dis-
tract from efforts devoted to 
higher priorities in the state,” 
the Law School’s communca-

In fireside chat, 

University President 

also discusses 

Greek life culture

By JEN CALFAS

Daily Staff Reporter

Greek life and mental health 

dominated 
the 
conversation 

at University President Mark 
Schlissel’s monthly fireside chat 
Tuesday.

Held in the Michigan Union’s 

Willis Ward Lounge, students 
asked Schlissel and E. Royster 
Harper, vice president of student 
life, about specific initiatives to 
improve the mental health ser-
vices the University offers, and 
the aftermath of a controversial 
all-chapter meeting of Greek life 
members in September.

“I don’t think it was appropri-

ately structured,” Schlissel said 
of the September meeting. “You 
can’t very often force people to 
show up and listen. I was disap-
pointed in the fact that people 
didn’t listen and showed disre-
spect.”

In 
September, 
Schlissel 

required all chapters of the Uni-
versity’s Greek community to 
send at least 70 percent of their 
members to a meeting in Hill 
Auditorium, where Schlissel said 
Greek life culture “devalues” a 
University degree and voiced his 
disappointment in the party cul-
ture and sexual misconduct that 
occurs within the Greek com-
munity.

LSA sophomore Clare Nien-

stedt, a member of the Uni-
versity’s Phi Beta Pi chapter, 
asked Schlissel if anything has 
improved since the meeting. She 
also agreed with Schlissel that 
the meeting wasn’t structured 
appropriately.

Schlissel said he has since 

learned more about the positive 
attributes of Greek life, including 
the philanthropic work done in 
the community and the fact that 
members of the Greek commu-
nity have higher GPAs then the 
overall average at the University.

However, he said the Univer-

sity is still working to improve 
the party culture he voiced dis-
satisfaction with in September.

University of Akron 
diversity adminstrator 
delivers Black Heritage 

Month address 

By ADAM HIYAMA

For the Daily

University of Michigan alum 

Lee A. Gill, vice president for 
inclusion and equity at the Uni-
versity of Akron, addressed a 
group of more than 40 students 
at 
Rackham 
Amphitheatre 

Tuesday to outline connections 

between the Black Action Move-
ment at the University during the 
1970s and the #BBUM campaign 
launched in 2014.

The hashtag and social move-

ment surrounding its use gar-
nered national attentionwhen 
thousands of people took to social 
media to describe their experi-
ences being Black at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.

Hosted by the Office of Multi-

Ethnic Student Affairs, the event 
was the inaugural lecture for a 
slate of University Black Heritage 
Month events. In the lecture, Gill 
highlighted connections between 

missions of activism during his 
time as a student and now.

“If we had social media then, 

we would be saying the same 
things you’re saying,” Gill said, 
referencing the #BBUM move-
ment.

Discussing the 2003 Supreme 

Court ruling in Bollinger v. Grut-
ter to uphold affirmative action at 
the University’s Law School, Gill 
referenced Justice Sandra Day 
O’Connor’s opinion for the case 
in which she wrote she hoped 
diversity would not be an issue in 
25 years.

Change caused by 
decline in market, 
University Plant 
operations says

By KEVIN LINDER

For the Daily

Effective Jan. 1, the Univer-

sity of Michigan Plant Build-
ing and Grounds Services has 
suspended the collection of 
glass for recycling. This change 
comes in response to a decline 
of local glass recycling markets.

The University’s current sys-

tem is single-stream recycling, 
where recyclable materials such 
as paper and recyclable plastics 
are all collected in the same bin 
and sorted at a recycling facility. 
Western Washtenaw Recycling 
Authority has been the organi-
zation providing recycling ser-
vices to the University, but due 
to the decline in the glass mar-
ket, it has ceased its acceptance 
of glass materials.

‘U’ president 

encourages difficult 

conversations for 
diversity reforms

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

At Tuesday’s Central Student 

Government meeting, University 
President Mark Schlissel spoke 
about several ways he hoped 
to open an inclusive campus 
dialogue on topics such as race 
and diversity at the University 
during his tenure.

During his remarks to the 

assembly, Schlissel stressed the 
importance of not only diversity 
of students on campus, but also 
diversity of student opinions, 
saying 
students 
should 
be 

exposed to opinions they don’t 
necessarily agree with.

“A 
significant 
fraction 
of 

students make it through their 

four or five years of undergrad 
without really taking advantage 
of 
this 
once-in-a-lifetime 

opportunity to learn from each 
other,” Schlissel said. “I’m going 
to make an effort in the coming 
years 
to 
very 
purposefully 

provoke 
difficult 
discussions 

and invite speakers that you’ll 
protest.”

During a hearing later in 

the 
meeting 
confirming 
his 

appointment as chair of the 
Campus Inclusion Commission, 
LSA junior Kendall Poindexter 
drew on Schlissel’s statements 
in his support for differing 
perspectives and backgrounds on 
campus.

“While nobody likes conflict, 

by hearing different viewpoints 
everybody is able to learn from 
one another, especially if they’re 
willing to hear it,” Poindexter 
said.

In December, the Campus 

Inclusion 
Commission 
was 

disbanded following the sudden 
resignation of all 11 commission 

members 
after 
the 
previous 

chair 
was 
terminated. 
The 

current membership status of the 
commission is not known.

Resolutions
At Tuesday’s meeting, the 

body brought four resolutions to 
the floor discussing the creation 
of a centralized web resource 
for 
undocumented 
students, 

refurbishment of the mental 
health services department as 
part of the upcoming Union 
renovations and a resolution 
to 
rename 
the 
Biomedical 

Science Research Building after 
University 
President 
Emerita 

Mary Sue Coleman.

A 
resolution 
authored 
by 

LSA juniors David Schafer and 
Anushka 
Sarkar 
noted 
that 

though the University financial 
aid website has resources for 
undocumented students, there 
is no centralized online page for 
all other available resources for 
undocumented students, and that 
other universities — including the 
University of Southern California 
— have similar webpages.

If enacted, this resolution 

would create an “Undocumented 
Student Resource Guide” tab 
on the CSG website with links 
to relevant legal services and 
student support networks.

CSG also heard a resolution 

calling for their endorsement of 
the renaming of the biological 
sciences building after former 
University President Mary Sue 
Coleman.

The resolution — authored 

by LSA sophomore Nicholas 
Fadanelli, LSA senior Michael 
Chrzan, LSA junior Stephen 
Halperin, CSG vice president, 
LSA junior Yong-Joon Kim and 
LSA 
senior 
Reid 
Klootwyk, 

LSA Student Government vice 
president — notes Coleman’s 
significant contributions as an 
academic 
and 
administrator, 

and that there is a precedent for 
former University presidents to 

have a building named after them.

The resolution further says no 

buildings on campus are named 
after women, and that women 
are 
greatly 
underrepresented 

in scientific fields. Coleman is a 
biochemist.

Though CSG lacks the authority 

to actually rename the building, if 
the resolution is passed, the body 
will officially endorse doing so 
and will actively lobby members 
of the University administration 
and the University’s Board of 
Regents on the issue.

LSA-SG 
passed 
a 
similar 

resolution on Jan. 28.

An additional resolution was 

heard by CSG about using the 
body’s resources to send aid 
to the city of Flint, though it 
was found unfeasible due to a 
University policy policing the 
use of funds generated by student 
organizations.

“University 
guidelines 

prohibit University money to go 
into charity use,” Public Policy 
sophomore Jacob Pearlman, CSG 
legal counsel, said.

In 
the 
bylines 
stipulating 

money management by student 
organizations through the Office 
of Campus Involvement, the 
assembly is unable to donate 
funds for resources for Flint.

Thirteen years after O’Connor 

delivered her landmark opin-
ion, Gill said issues of diver-
sity 
and 
inclusion 
are 
still 

impacting students. He urged 
audience members to take initia-
tive in addressing these issues.

“It’s still an issue,” he said. 

“Guess who’s taking the battle 
now? It’s your battle.”

When asked by an audience 

member about reconciling social 
justice efforts with academics 
and other educational or personal 
activities, Gill said he didn’t bal-
ance the two very well, noting 

that he had to put his activism on 
hold once he went to law school.

He also shared his experience 

as an undergraduate student at 
the University, describing his 
time on campus as one of the best 
decisions he has ever made, as 
well as several stories of individu-
als who have inspired him to suc-
ceed in life.

Gill was appointed the Univer-

sity of Akron’s first associate vice 
president for inclusion and equity 
and the chief diversity officer in 
2008 after its creation to facilitate 
diversity initiatives with recruit-
ment on their campus.

He cited former Jon Onye 

Lockard in particular as being 
influential in his life, saying he 

was inspired by how Lockard got 
involved in initiatives of social 
activism.

Lockard was a muralist who 

drew on African influences in his 
paintings and a faculty member 
at the University and Washtenaw 
Community College from 1970 
until his death in 2015. While at 
the University, Lockard co-found-
ed the Society for the Study of 
African Culture and Aesthetics.

“He was the reason I was suc-

cessful here,” Gill said, noting 
that Lockard was the senior art 
advisor for the Martin Luther 
King Jr. memorial.

Gill said his inspiration for the 

title of Tuesday night’s lecture, “If 
We Don’t Tell Them, They Won’t 

Know,” was derived from a song 
Lockard would play at the begin-
ning of every lecture, the Three 
Mo’ Tenors’ “Let Them Hear 
You.”

Discussing his own involve-

ment at the University, Gill 
highlighted his appointment as 
resident director of his floor in 
South Quad. According to Gill, a 
panel of housing employees ini-
tially denied him the job because 
he was Black. Gill successfully 
sued the University and after a 
more selective committee was 
appointed to review his candida-
cy, he received the job.

He said being a resident direc-

tor at South Quad Residence Hall-

Beyoncé announces fundraiser for 

Flint water crisis as part of tour

Amid a Super Bowl perfor-

mance and the announcement 
of her world tour, Beyoncé has 
found time for the children of 
Flint.

The singer announced today 

she will hold a benefit to raise 
funds for children in Flint as 
part of her Formation World 
Tour, according to a statement 
on Live Nation Entertainment’s 
website.

“True to her life’s work of 

always giving back, fans will 
be given the opportunity to 
participate in Beyoncé’s #Bey-
GOOD initiative supporting 
local United Way programs and 
the continued work surround-

ing the water crisis in Flint, 
Michigan,” the statement says.

The announcement comes 

a day after Beyonce debuted 
her new single Formation dur-
ing the halftime show of Super 
Bowl 50. 

After Flint switched its water 

supply to the Flint River in 
April 2014, the water was con-
taminated with lead for multiple 
months due to leakages from 
corroded water pipes. Flint offi-
cials, Gov. Rick Snyder (R ) and 
President Barack Obama have 
since declared a state of emer-
gency in the city. The crisis has 
spurred health concerns and 
has garnered national outrage, 

with protests calling for Sny-
der’s resignation for allegedly 
mishandling the situation.

According to the statement, 

Beyoncé will partner with 
United Way and the Community 
Foundation of Greater Flint to 
raise funds aimed at addressing 
long term impacts of the water 
crisis such as education, nutri-
tion and health.

The artist has joined the 

ranks of other celebrities that 
have pledged to aid residents 
impacted by the water crisis 
including P. Diddy, Mark Wahl-
berg and Cher.

Snyder addresses 
Flint water crisis in 
budget

Gov. Rick Synder plans to 

include $195 million in the 2017 
budget to address the Flint 
water crisis, according to the 
Detroit Free Press. The budget 
will be proposed on Wednesday. 
The request for Flint is broken 
down to support several efforts, 
including safe drinking, nutrition 
and education. The majority of 
the budget serves to improve the 
physical and social wellbeing of 
residents.

An estimated $15 million from 

the budget was allocated to fund 
food and nutrition, such as school 
meal programs, food banks and 
restaurant inspections. 

Snyder also plans to test and 

replace deficient water fixtures 
in educational settings. Officials 
claim that the contamination 
began when the administration 
decided to switch from Detroit’s 
water supply to Flint River water. 
In October, Flint switched back to 
Detroit’s water supply; however, 
lead continues to contaminate 
pipes and water fixtures.

The state previously provided 

vulnerable areas with $28 million 
to purchase bottled water and 
filters as well as to support other 
measures to address the water 
crisis. 

Detroit teachers 
plan walk-ins

Detroit Public Schools teachers 

planned walk-ins on Tuesday, 
deviating from their series 
of sick-outs over the past few 
weeks, according to the Detroit 
Free Press. The goal was to keep 
classes going while participants 
gathered before the school day 
to see the schools and engage 
in honest dialogue about the 
conditions.

Cass Technical High School’s 

walk-in began at 7:40 a.m., 
and afternoon walk-ins were 
scheduled in a series of other 
schools, such as Greenfield Union 
Elementary-Middle School, and 
Cooke Elementary.

The previous sick-outs served 

to demand attention to the 
devastated conditions of DPS 
schools. Teachers called in sick 
to protest the poor infrastructure 
and building conditions. On Jan. 
15, approximately 64 Detroit 
schools were shut down and over 
31,000 students were affected. 

The Free Press reported that 

$300,000 from the DPS budget 
has recently been reallocated 
from other departments to fund 
building projects. Forty-six of 97 
DPS schools have been expected 
since the sick-outs, and Tuesday’s 
walk-ins were an example of 
the continued pressure the 
community is putting on local and 
state government officials. 

The district’s emergency 

manager, Darnell Earley, 
announced his decision to step 
down at the end of February 
following a lawsuit filed on Jan. 29 
 

calling for his dismissal, according 
to the Detroit Free Press.

would be outweighed by the 
larger benefits to students, 
Kosowski said.

“This seems like a no-brain-

er,” LSA sophomore Cochise 
Jackson said about the bill. 
“When I was trying to buy 
my chem book for like $250, it 
would’ve been great if that was 
reduced even a little bit.”

LSA sophomore Jose Guz-

man echoed Jackson’s sen-
timent, 
saying 
he 
could 

definitely use extra funds and 
allocate them to other school-
related costs such as supplies.

LSA freshman Bryan Pol-

lard said when he came to the 
University he was nervous 
about the high prices of text-
books, but they actually ended 
up being less than what he was 
expecting. However, he said 
he still believes that having 
textbooks be sales tax exempt 
would be beneficial.

“I think this legislation 

would be great for a lot of 

manager of the Office of Campus 
Sustainability, stressed that the 
decision to suspend recycling was 
directly caused by the change at 
the Western Washtenaw Recy-
cling Authority.

“The decision to suspend glass 

recycling is due to our recycling 
facility’s decision to discontinue 
collecting the material because 
the local glass recycling market 
has ceased,” Berki said.

Berki added that glass consti-

tutes 1 percent of the 2,400 tons 
of material collected annually for 
recycling at the University. 

“In terms of Sustainability, the 

decision has a very low impact 
because glass comprises such a 
small percentage of U-M’s overall 
waste stream,” he wrote.

LSA junior Louisa Kane, a CSG 

University Sustainability Com-
mission member, said the Univer-
sity is taking steps to adjust to this 
change. 

“The University is already try-

ing to adjust accordingly by find-
ing new replacement products in 
recyclable materials, as well as 
developing a separate glass collec-
tion system for the glass products 
that are still floating around cam-
pus,” she said.

John Lawter, associate direc-

tor of University Plant Operations, 
said the suspension of glass col-
lection is not a significant blow 
to the recycling operations of the 
University. He added the change 
does serve as an indication of reli-
ance of the University’s recycling 
operations on external factors.

“The impact to our recycling 

rate will be minimal, however it 
does illustrate our need to have a 
flexible program that can respond 
to market fluctuations,” he said.

The change is one of the larger 

adjustments to recycling policy 
that the University has made in 
recent years, according to Lawter.

“This is probably the first time 

we have had to backtrack on a pro-
gram change of this magnitude, 
though it is still only 1 percent, and 

is somewhat of a warning on the 
volatility of the markets and their 
affects on our program,” he said.

Kane said since the suspension 

was forced by the decline of glass 
recycling markets, and wasn’t by 
University design, students and 
faculty involved in sustainability 
and environmental advocacy on 
campus did not have any say in the 
matter.

“I personally have heard buzz 

circulating around it in the sus-
tainability community, but not 
with much urgency or backlash,” 
Kane said. “It’s more of a worry 
of a messy transition into a new 
system within a such a large insti-
tution rather than an outcry of 
sustainability injustice.”

Berki wrote that Plant Opera-

tions 
has 
been 
listening 
to 

feedback from the University 
community regarding the sus-
pension, but cannot fully address 
concerns since the change was 
ultimately out of the University’s 
control.

“Plant Operations has fielded 

many inquiries from students, fac-
ulty and staff regarding this recent 
change however has not received 
any specific opposition from envi-
ronmental advocacy groups or 
organizations,” Berki said.

Lawter said he thought that 

the lack of opposition from the 
University community was due to 
the fact that the University had no 
choice in the decision.

“The campus community has 

been very understanding and 
cooperative which is good given 
this is something that is beyond 
our control,” Lawter said. “We are 
also getting a lot of good feedback 
on ideas to minimize the effects of 
market changes to our program in 
the future.”

Lawter said one of the biggest 

concerns that University Plant 
Operations currently holds is the 
worry that glass on campus will 
contaminate the single-stream 
recycling program. If too much 
glass is found in a given collection, 
he said the entire collection must 
be sent off to a landfill as waste.

“We need to broadly educate 

the campus community on this 

change to minimize contamina-
tion of our single-stream program 
with glass,” Lawter said. “We are 
working with University Com-
munications and the Office of 
Campus Sustainability on getting 
the word out in as many forms as 
possible.”

In regard to the University of 

Michigan’s image as an environ-
mentally friendly institution and 
campus, Kaine said he didn’t think 
things would change.

“As long as the University holds 

to its statements on accommodat-
ing for this change, then hopefully 
we will rise to the standards we’ve 
set for ourselves as a University,” 
he said.

With other campus sustain-

ability initiatives and goals still 
on track, Berki wrote that he 
feels that the glass suspension 
will not hinder the University’s 
improvement as an environmen-
tally friendly and sustainability 
conscious institution.

“Despite this setback with 

glass recycling, we feel the over-
all outlook for waste reduction 
on campus is very positive,” Berki 
wrote. “The campus community 
is working hard to achieve our 
campus-wide sustainability goal 
of reducing waste sent to landfills 
by 40%”.

When asked about whether or 

not glass would be re-listed as a 
collectable material, Lawter said 
he believes glass will “probably 
never” be re-added to the single 
stream. 

“Glass has been problematic at 

all the Material Recovery Facili-
ties who have converted to single 
stream, which is most everyone in 
our neighborhood,” he said.

Berki echoed Lawter’s senti-

ments, writing that he believed 
glass would likely not be re-added 
to the list of acceptable materials. 

“As always, we will continue to 

face these challenges head-on and 
hopefully find solutions to them.”

the things that put your health 
at risk and make it difficult for 
you to make good decisions in a 
situation,” Schlissel said.

He also pointed to a newly 

formed 30-member task force 
charged with suggesting policy 
reforms for the Greek commu-
nity. The task force includes 
former Panhellenic Associa-
tion President Maddy Walsh 
and Alex Krupiak, former 
Interfraternity Council presi-
dent.

Another area for improve-

ment 
Schlissel 
addressed 

Tuesday was the staffing and 
organization of the Univer-
sity’s Counseling and Psycho-
logical Services.

Both LSA sophomore Kelly 

Crosson and Business sopho-
more Sam Orley expressed con-
cern with the stigmatization of 
mental health on campus and 
how CAPS can improve as a 
whole.

Crosson said she had to wait 

seven weeks for a preliminary 
appointment at CAPS.

“Your story is really disap-

pointing,” Schlissel said in 
response.

“I’m a little concerned that 

there are areas that there is 
so much need that it’s going to 
be hard to keep up,” Schlissel 
added. “There are a lot of men-
tal health challenges that come 
with being a student here.”

He said the University is 

currently expanding the CAPS 
staff not only to have more pro-
fessionals available to help stu-
dents, but also to diversify their 
staff to ensure more identities 
and backgrounds are repre-
sented to help students feel at 
ease.

Orley, who is a member of 

Wolverine Wellness, a student 
group created to promote men-
tal heath resources and des-
tigmatization, said the group 
hopes more professors will 
include CAPS information on 
their syllabi. A discussion also 
took place about the inclusion 
of CAPS information on the 
back of Mcards.

“I believe this can only not 

happen if someone comes up 
with a compelling reason for it 
not to be done,” Schlissel said 
in support of the Mcard propo-
sition.

Students also asked ques-

tions that are often posed at 
the monthly fireside chat con-
cerning the improvement of 
the experience of students on 
North Campus, the ongoing 
increase of tuition and how to 
make the campus more diverse.

Throughout the hour-long 

discussion, Schlissel continued 
to express his gratitude for the 
questions posed by students, 
and urged each student in the 
room to ask one — causing the 
event to go over its marketed 
timeframe.

“I’ve only been here for a 

year and a half, and I’ve never 
taught my own class or had 
advisees, so my own learning 
about the student community 
and seeing the campus through 
your eyes helps me understand 
the job I have and make this 
place as good as it needs to be 
for you, and, more important-
ly, for those people who come 
after you,” he said.

tion director Shelley Rodg-
ers wrote in an e-mail to The 
Michigan Daily. 

The Flint water crisis began 

in April 2014 when the city, 
under state emergency man-
agement, switched its water 
supply from Detroit city water 
to water treatment centers 
connected to the Flint River, 
which resulted in contamina-
tion after the more corrosive 
river water caused lead from 
the pipes to leak into the water. 
The water supply was not 
switched back until October 
2015. Though Snyder issued 
a formal apology last month, 
and has declared a national 
state of emergency in the city, 
protesters have alleged that 
the governor knew about the 
issues earlier than October, 
and should have taken action 
sooner. The governor’s office 
has maintained he learned 
about the issue in October. 

Ann Arbor Alliance For 

Black 
Lives 
representative 

Rebecca Ahmad-Robinson, a 
Public Health graduate stu-
dent, said Snyder should be 
held accountable not just for 
Flint, but also for deplor-
able conditions in the Detroit 
Public 
Schools 
and 
mass 

incarceration in state pris-
ons. At multiple points during 
the event, attendees linked 
#BlackLivesMatter to Flint.

“We can’t breathe under 

Snyder, but we also can’t drink 
water,” 
Ahmad-Robinson 

yelled during the march.

Besides students and other 

citizens upset with the cur-
rent state in Flint and state 
politics, the National Lawyers 
Guild from the University’s 
Law School sent some of its 
members. NLG is a national 
organization that aims to unite 
various people from the law 
force that seek to change the 
ill-structured components of 
the political and economic 
systems in the country. Law 
School student Reid Murdock, 
a member of the University’s 
chapter of NLG, said they 
attended the protest to raise 
awareness about human rights.

“We are here to ensure that 

people’s civil rights are pro-
tected. Everyone here is using 
their freedom of speech and 
freedom of assembly,” Mur-
dock said. “We are here to 
make sure things go smoothly 
and to be a resource and pos-
sibly a liaison with the police 
should they come.”

Other groups present includ-

ed the Socialist Equality Party. 
Lawrence 
Porter, 
assistant 

national secretary of the SEP, 
said he believes the water cri-
sis is not only a crisis but also 
an attack on the working class 
people of Flint.

“It’s a crime, without ques-

tion. It is a monumental crime 
that is being carried out,” Por-
ter said. “We believe that it’s 
not just by Snyder; it’s been 
carried out by both issues. It is 
a bipartisan attack.”

was what ultimately allowed 
him, along with the newly 
formed Minority Council on 
campus, to create multicultural 
lounges in residence halls.

“From the Minority Council, 

we began to push for what we 
called Black Housing Units,” he 
said. “But what the concept was, 
was that we were going to take 
a whole half side of South Quad, 
and we were going to have it 
mixed between white and Black 
and other ethnic groups. But the 
idea was to have a predominant 
number to be African Ameri-
can, so for the first time African 
Americans could be in the major-
ity as opposed to being in the 
minority.”

Originally, 
the 
idea 
was 

approved by the Housing Policy 
Committee, Gill said, but the 
Board of Regents rejected it on 
the grounds that the policy was 
akin to segregation. The alter-
native that they offered was the 
creation of the multicultural 
lounges.

LSA junior Adelia Davis, a 

diversity peer education, said she 

was intrigued by the fact that the 
Black Action Movement of Gill’s 
time was responsible for the cre-
ation of the multicultural loung-
es in the University’s residence 
halls that she and other DPEs 
oversee.

“I found it very inspiring,” 

she said. “His story, the work 
he’s doing, and just his point of 
that the battle for freedom has 
to be won every generation. I get 
frustrated, because it’s a lot of 
the same issues that are recur-
ring, but it totally makes sense: 
Each generation has to struggle 
for this freedom. It’s disappoint-
ing, but at the same time it just 
empowers us to always be aware 
and active in our community,” 
Davis said. 

Public Policy senior Eric Riley 

said he was also surprised by 
the extent to which BAM was 
responsible for the multicultural 
lounges.

“We really are the fruits of his 

labor,” Riley said.

Leon Howard III, a program 

manager in the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs, said 
while students today are fighting 
the same fight as those in Gill’s 
time, he thought progress was 
being made.

4A — Wednesday, February 10, 2016

I’m not sure who I will cast my 

ballot for in November, let alone 
in the Michigan primary. I have a 
Bernie sticker on my laptop and a 
Hillary magnet on my fridge. I am 
constantly learning more about each 
candidate, while also balancing my 
pragmatic feelings from a tactical 
strategic perspective. This article 
is not about endorsing a candidate. 
Sanders and Clinton will both 
need to produce more convincing 
evidence to inspire my allegiance. 

Last week, when the results were 

rolling in and the caucus-goers of 
Iowa felt a similar split, resulting in 
only a 0.2 percent win for Hillary 
Clinton over Bernie Sanders, I felt 
my 
tentativeness 
was 
justified. 

Eagerly, I turned to social media to 
hear how everyone else had reacted 
to the news. What I stumbled 
upon was not a united liberal front 
excited that two candidates had 
proven viability, furthering the 
discourse of economic inequalities 
and women’s rights and looking to 
expand protections for minority 
groups. Instead, I found rhetoric 
barely deserving of that term. It was 
acrid and not politically engaging 
or smart. It was a verbal assault on 
the supporters of Clinton by the 
supporters of Sanders.

“Bernie Bros,” as certain media 

outlets have deemed them, are the 
passionate, often young and often 
(but not always) male supporters 
of Sanders. These people are very 
active on social media, and while 
many supporters of Sanders have 
followed his lead in a mostly positive 
campaign focused on issues of 
substance, this subset digresses. 
There 
are 
varying 
degrees 
of 

comments sponsored by “Bernie 
Bros,” from portrayal of all Clinton 
supporters as robotic, to insisting 
that Ms. Clinton was vehemently 
arrogant in her claim of victory at 
the caucus. 

The Sanders campaign, which 

employs many people of politically 
underrepresented backgrounds, has 
asked its supporters several times 
to “#FeelTheBern respectfully,” but 
the damage has already been done.

Clinton has been the brunt of 

overwhelming amounts of hate in 
her time as a public official. She 
has been called every name and 
criminalized with every action — 

and some of these characterizations 
were valid, policy-based criticisms. 
But why is it that her appearance 
is constantly policed, while Mr. 
Sanders is able to show up with his 
unkempt white hair? Why is it that 
“likability” is such a huge part of 
journalism surrounding Ms. Clinton, 
but people rarely wonder if Bernie is 
charming enough to be electable?

Then there is the gross meme that 

implores people to compare Sanders 
and Clinton on the real issues, which 
sounds innocuous enough. The 
format of the meme is such: a text box 
at the top populated with the issue 
du jour, photos of the two Democrats 
side by side, and text boxes below 
each of their photos stating their 
respective opinions. Some of them 
are passively funny, the kind of joke 
you smirk at out of recognition, not 
real humor. The thing is, we’re not 
voting for a president based on their 
comedic chops. If we were, I think 
Trump would’ve been ironically 
instituted as supreme leader already.

Sadly, 
this 
meme 
becomes 

discomforting extremely quickly. 
Sanders is depicted as a wild, crazy, 
cool dude’s dude who is vaguely high 
at all times. He’s shown as the kind 
of guy you’d find on Reddit getting 
way too excited about Radiohead. 
He’s the bro who’s blowing your 
mind with Marxist theory freshman 
year, because of course you’ve never 
heard of it before, while you’re 
sitting by him on the stained, dusty 
carpet of the staircase at a house 
party. Clinton is depicted as a 
67-year-old woman who has worked 
in government for decades and not 
done much other than deal with 
testifying before Congress and work 
on her campaign before watching 
The Good Wife at night.

These portrayals aren’t equal. 

Sanders 
has 
been 
involved 
in 

government for 34 years, beginning 
with an eight-year mayoral term in 
Burlington, followed by 16 years in 
the House, and nearly 10 years in the 
Senate. He’s been in government for 
a long time, dealing with issues, not 
with Pokémon. Let’s recognize that. 
Let’s acknowledge that all things 
equal, Sanders and Clinton are both 
veterans in American politics.

Why is she depicted as a boring 

old woman and he gets to be a 
carefree hip guy? It’s not only unfair 

— it’s stupid. Clinton, and women 
online everywhere, have tried to 
portray themselves in certain ways 
— only to face criticisms at every 
turn. Sanders is better than that. I 
implore his supporters to be better 
than that, too.

Sanders 
has 
tried 
to 
frame 

this campaign as a positive one, 
and has stated his interest in 
discussing the real problems faced 
by real Americans. This meme 
from his supporters does neither. 
It, along with the derogatory online 
interactions, drags the goals set by 
the Sanders campaign to a despicably 
low standard.

I think it says something real 

about the power of the “Bernie 
Bro” culture that I am hesitant and 
even a little scared to write this 
piece. And I agree with Sanders 
on many issues! Publicly granting 
Clinton a right to dignity and equal 
treatment online should be a given. 
My ability to have enthusiasm about 
more than one candidate should be 
a great victory for the Democratic 
Party’s strong contenders. Instead, 
these social media norms make my 
stomach sink. I feel like if I say these 
things, I will be chalked up as “just 
another feminist” who is influenced 
by “big money.” That is a serious 
problem.

Despite my amazement with 

Sanders’ ability to raise his campaign 
funds from individual contributors, 
his long history of supporting gay 
rights and the phenomenon of his 
jump from a 62-point trail to a dead 
heat with Clinton, I have a really 
hard time identifying with his 
movement. When a vocal portion 
of his supporters is so clearly 
committed to firing antagonisms 
into the Internet, I am being burned 
by “the Bern.”

I cannot consciously align myself 

with a movement that sours my 
conscience, no matter how I feel 
about it intellectually. That may 
be a fault of my political identity 
and, as some could perceive it, 
sensitivity. But I’m not alone in 
these reservations, and the Sanders 
campaign will need to surmount 
this in order to secure my (currently 
wavering) vote for the primary.

The Trump effect

E-mail michEllE at shEngmi@umich.Edu
MICHELLE SHENG

D

onald Trump’s campaign for president 
still strikes me as some sort of cruel 
performance piece or, at the very least, 

a brilliantly orchestrated 
satire of the American 
political process — but 
that’s precisely the point. 
Trump is an entertainer, 
and every aspect of this 
quality is reflected in his 
path to the presidency: 
from his obscene remarks 
to his pervasive presence 
in the media. However, the 
obvious issue with treating 
a presidential election like 
a reality TV show is that 
it is decidedly not. There 
are real-world consequences to plucking 
at your audience like radicalized guitar 
strings. Although Trump may be portraying 
an exaggerated character for the sake of 
garnering attention, the voters he attracts 
are completely and terrifyingly genuine, and 
represent something far more sinister than 
political theater.

From the beginning, Trump has functioned 

as a compelling figure in the context of the 
political sphere. Upon announcing his bid in 
June 2015, the real estate tycoon became an 
eccentric asterisk in a race that was initially 
Jeb Bush’s to win. Since then, his numbers 
have skyrocketed to unforeseeable heights. 
This influx of support is evidently not due to 
his policies (which are vague at their best and 
borderline fascist at their worst) or his political 
experience (which is virtually nonexistent, 
unless you count that time he almost ran for 
president in 2000), but because of the way 
he strategically markets himself to his target 
demographic.

There are two noticeable personas that 

Trump embodies, both of which seem to 
work inexorably in his favor: the mogul 
and the populist. The former rears its head 
whenever the topic of debate shifts to more 
“establishment” issues — he can be a smooth-
talking, well-connected entrepreneur with 
decades of experience under his belt if it suits 
the context. The latter persona, however, is 
more present at his chaotic political rallies, 
during which he hits the pressure points of the 
average blue-collar American with impressive 
precision — the personification of everything 
you have ever heard your grandfather 
complain about after a few beers, except 
completely sober, embraced by millions, and 
dangerously close to filling one of the most 
influential positions on the planet.

Trump’s ability to alternate seamlessly 

between his two political personalities has 
proven to be his most effective campaign 
strategy. The media tycoon fares just fine 
with voters earning less than $50,000 per 
year, despite lacking the classic “humble 
beginnings” 
narrative 
that 
politicians 

commonly craft to score points with the 
working class. For a man worth $4 billion, 
Trump’s trick to wooing Middle America has 
been to take on the role of a brutally honest, 
anti-establishment 
mouthpiece 
for 
the 

economically downtrodden while effectively 
sweeping his empire of greed, fraud and 
opulence under the rug.

Nevertheless, 
despite 
his 
surge 
in 

popularity, Donald Trump is only one (albeit 
unorthodox) politician, and realistically, his 
odds of actually becoming our 45th president 
are slim — but the impact he’s had on voters 
will linger long after his poll numbers 
dwindle, and that is precisely the issue. The 
hoards of supporters with whom his rhetoric 
resonated will remain frustrated and militant 
until some other politician comes along, using 
vague phrases like “take our jobs back” and 
“make America great again” to rouse them into 
action.

Trump is playing a game with Americans 

that not even he can win in the end, because 
what he doesn’t realize is just how volatile 
his voter base really is. His carefully crafted 
stances on immigration, Islam and other 
hot-button topics may be mere talking points 
with which he can capture the extremely 
conservative vote, but they are also real 
opinions that his supporters hold, and 
pandering to them only further radicalizes 
this prejudiced ideology.

The Trump campaign has shaken the 

political culture of this country to its core, 
drawing out all of its most abhorrent qualities 
in the process. Through loudness, hyperbole 
and spectacle, he has managed to claw his 
way to the top of the polls, leaving a trail of 
misguided anger and xenophobia in his wake.

Of course, he didn’t plant these ideas in 

people’s heads; they were there long before he 
stepped onto the scene. He simply did what 
he does best: interpret what his market wants 
and cater to those desires (even the more 
disturbing implicit ones). At the end of the 
day, Trump is still an entertainer, but there 
is nothing entertaining about what he has 
created.

wild 
ride 

of 
an 
election 

already.

Yet here we are, almost a full 

year after Ted Cruz became the first 
major candidate to announce his 
candidacy as we embarked on this 
ride that has yet to even make its stop 
in Michigan. Canadians completed 
their recent election process in less 
then three months, and the British 
take a mere three and a half weeks to 
elect an entire government, but that’s 
simply not the American way, where 
we supersize everything, including 
the election process. Media stories 
about election primaries and Donald 
Trump quotes, all leading up to an 
event nearly a year away, take news 
precedence over the current refugee 
crisis overseas, the Zika virus, the 
Flint water crisis, whatever the heck 
our government is doing while all 
this politicking is going on, and even 
given higher front-page placement 
than the most American of all events: 
the Super Bowl.

It’s a fatiguing process, in which 

it takes five months of voting in 
primaries and caucuses just to 
figure out who will get the final 
nomination at the party conventions 
in July. Our society has advanced to 
a stage where information can be 
retrieved and transmitted quickly 
and easily accessed via the Internet. 
Which, in theory, should allow the 

process to move quicker and allow 
voters to make more intelligent 
choices without relying on months 
of 
debates 
and 
campaigning; 

instead, election season has become 
a slogging marathon race through 
a soaking trail of mud. It’s nothing 
more than an exercise in angering 
me, the American voter. Nobody 
likes the marathon, and it’s long past 
due to at least cut it to a mid-distance 
race.

The process began to lengthen 

in the 1960s, and the trend moved 
away from internally nominated 
candidates to placing emphasis 
on the primaries with John F. 
Kennedy’s candidacy. Along with 
the fallout of the 1968 Democratic 
Convention, the shift to focusing 
on the results of state primaries 
allowed for a larger field of potential 
candidates to enter the fray, which 
certainly makes the process more 
democratic by invoking the opinions 
of the citizens. The process also 
gives more time for candidates to be 
exposed to the public, and given the 
changes in polls over time, it does 
have an effect as the citizens begin 
to settle on preferred candidates due 
to the publicity.

However, 
along 
with 
the 

reasonably 
positive 
explanation 

for early primaries, the early start 
to the cycle highlights a darker 
side of politics: money. Campaign 
finance chiefs have floated out that 
at least $50 million to $100 million 
is necessary to financially compete 
in the primaries, a figure that holds 
consistent as five of the six leading 
candidates 
across 
both 
parties 

(excluding 
Donald 
Trump 
who 

does not comparatively fundraise) 
have raised more than $75 million 
to date. Months before official 
announcements, many candidates 
gauge donor and vote interest to 
test the viability of their campaign, 
lengthening the whole process even 
more. If enough money isn’t raised 

early enough in the cycle, candidates 
will 
find 
themselves 
massively 

underprepared for the marathon of 
campaigning.

Whatever combination of causes 

has led to this, the result is months of 
campaigning that goes on despite the 
majority of Americans agreeing that 
the season is too long, significantly 
over-covered by the media compared 
to actual news interest, and having 
mixed opinions on whether the 
campaigns are even informative. 
More simply put: It’s a massive waste 
of time and resources for something 
that should be carried out more 
efficiently. Elections take time, but 
the expansion of the process has 
only brought increasing political 
noise and tabloid-like coverage to the 
process for up to half of a presidential 
cycle. Far more important than any 
benefits of the primary process is 
the impedance of the discussion of 
important issues covered up by the 
never-ending election and the lost 
productivity that it entails. And 
when voter turnout is often low in 
these elections, such reasons are 
contributing factors.

Solutions for the problem of the 

ever-expanding election calendar 
including 
eliminating 
donation 

limits and thus lightening the need 
to court high amounts of unique 
donors, 
reducing 
the 
influence 

of primaries by scheduling less, 
increasing the number of unpledged 
convention delegates, to changing 
the primary scheduling as the 
parties have already done for 2016. 
It’ll take a combination of many 
reforms to curb the advantage of 
early entry and require the support 
of the politicians themselves, always 
a difficult task but for a worthy cause 
of moving toward an efficient model 
that better serves the citizens whom 
our elections impact.

‘Galavant’ wraps 
up with homages

Amid cancellation 
rumors, Season 2 
finale a success.

By MEGAN MITCHELL

For the Daily

Through all of its madness 

and 
cringe-worthy 
scenes, 

ABC’s “Galavant” might just be 
the only show 
on 
television 

that’s 
not 

bending 
over 

backwards 
for 

the 
audience’s 

approval. 
It’s 

the 
“friends 

with 
benefits” 

show that has 
absolutely 
zero strings attached because 
they might not make it another 
season. And trust me when I say 
that they’re well aware of this — 
it’s basically a “do whatever the 
hell you want” card, and they 
definitely swipe it in the season 
two finale. After all, this might 
be the end. Capital T-E “The 
End;” And if this is really it for the 
musical, then they certainly went 
out with one hell of a show.

The first part of the finale 

“Battle of the Three Armies” plays 
off of the “Hobbit” franchise’s 
“Battle of the Five Armies” in both 
name and style. If J.R.R. Tolkien 
had 
somehow 
written 
“The 

Hobbit” as a Broadway musical 
directed by Mel Gibson, then 
this 20-minute episode would 
hit the target dead-center. First, 
in arguably the catchiest episode 
recap in history and surprising 
throwback to “A Knight’s Tale”, 
the Jester (Ben Presley, “What 
We Did on Our Holiday”) gives 
us the lowdown on what’s been 
going on this season, which earns 

him a round of applause from the 
armies about to face each other to 
the death. Meanwhile, Princess 
Isabella Maria Lucia Elizabetta of 
Valencia (Karen David, “Castle”) 
faces her own challenges when the 
Valencian army suggests suicide 
as an alternative to battle, which 
leads 
to 
a 
“Braveheart”-style 

speech and a song.

“It’s a Good Day to Die” is 

frustratingly catchy. It exposes 
the Hortensia confidence and the 
ultimate fear of the Valencians 
when the battle begins; it even 
reprises 
a 
duet 
between 
a 

young couple whose house is 
unfortunately located right in the 
center of the battlefield. But despite 
these humorous inserts, emotions 
really rule most of this episode. 
Especially the hesitation shown 
by Queen Madalena (Mallory 
Jansen, “Young & Hungry”) when 
the magician Wormwood (Robert 
Lindsay, “Atlantis”) requests her 
use of dark magic to win the battle. 
“Actually, I’ve been having second 
thoughts about the dark evil way,” 
she spills. Even though it’s whiny 
and grabs a quick laugh, it’s totally 
believable — I mean, it took a 
while for even Anakin Skywalker 
to turn into Darth Vader. It takes 
a lot of thought, and apparently a 
Disney-esque musical number and 
synchronized choreography for 
the Queen to give in.

The first part of the season 

finale ends with a reunion of 
friends and the reprise of “It’s a 
Good Day to Die” that gives way 
to the clever “Oh please, this isn’t 
‘Game of Thrones!’ ” line that will 
most definitely be recycled by 
fans. Just as the Jester ponders 
leaving the audience on another 
huge cliffhanger similar to that of 
season one, the screen promptly 
switches to black.

The final part of the season 

finale begins with duet with 

Richard 
(Timothy 
Omundson, 

“Supernatural”) and his younger 
character’s 
counterpart 
(Alfie 

Simmons, “The Woman in Black 
2”) 
that’s 
cringeworthy, 
but 

stylistically pleasing. It highlights 
an important question we all 
might be pondering. What would 
our younger selves think about 
who we are today? So even though 
it’s incredibly cheesy and off-
key, there’s a deeper, emotional 
meaning much like that we’ve 
seen in the more recent episodes of 
“Galavant”. The writers are taking 
all the right stylistic chances with 
this episode.

We’re thrown back into battle 

and as Richard fights Wormwood, 
we finally see the true power 
that’s been previously dormant in 
Richard after the supposed death 
of the lizard/dragon Tad Cooper. 
The change between fighting 
freestyle and with a vengeance 
that Omundson shows is striking 
and quite terrifying, so I almost 
wish we could have witnessed it 
sooner. Now completely worthy 
of the “One True King” title that 
we’ve all been waiting for, Richard 
pursues lost love Roberta (Clare 
Foster, “Ripper Street”) in an 
attempt to save her from a life of 
becoming an old cat lady, earning 
him a ticket from the police on the 
way that hits us all in that secret 
“oh, c’mon!” spot, I’m sure.

Overall, the (possibly final) 

season finale of “Galavant” took 
chances that paid off in the long 
run, while still playing off the 
“cheese” factor it’s well known 
for. One last joke pokes fun at the 
unlikeliness of a renewal for the 
show and the possibility of the 
cast being sent to “crappy cable 
TV” before it finally all comes 
to an end. Almost. Because Tad 
Cooper finally turns into a big 
fucking dragon at the end, and I’m 
personally proud of that.

A case against the 
Canada Goose coat

STYLE NOTEBOOK

By HANNAH SPARKS

For the Daily

It’s that time again, the time 

when all of the Canadian Geese 
start to migrate to Ann Arbor, 
Mich. When the temperatures 
drop, we see an influx of these 
geese by the hundreds. If you 
haven’t caught onto my attempt 
at sarcasm yet, I’m talking about 
Canada Goose jackets. Having just 
transferred to this fine University, 
seeing every other person wear 
a Canada Goose is the very first 
thing I noticed.

For the record, I do own a Canada 

Goose, but in my defense it’s just 
a vest. How did Canada Goose 
manage to become so popular in 
these past five years? Apart from 
them being everywhere, some of 
the jackets are quite unique and 
come in fabulous colors: greens, 
blues, greys and red. Having said 
that, the majority of what I see is 
the same long, black fur hooded 
Canada Goose parka.

Prices for these beloved jackets 

start at $495 and can get as high 
as $1,275. Can we just stop and put 
that into perspective for a second? 
That money could go toward so 

many other things — paying rent, 
paying for insurance, a million 
Starbucks coffees and not to 
mention you get even get a plane 
ticket to Europe for those high 
prices. Also let’s not forget the 
last option — we could always just 
choose to put our money in the 
bank and save it, but that’s, like, a 
crazy concept.

Canada Goose jackets are quite 

literally made for and worn by 
people who are out in the Arctic. I 
know Michigan can feel like living 
in an icebox at times, but there are 
other jackets out there that can 
make you feel just as warm as that 
Canada Goose. Admittedly, when 
I first got my hands on my Canada 
Goose vest I was very eager to 
“show it off.” Being someone who 
values material things (sorry not 
sorry), I felt very proud to finally 
have my very own Canada Goose 
product. Yet, having owned it 
for two years now, I realize it’s 
nothing more than a warm vest 
with a cool patch on the front. 
There’s really nothing else to it. If 
anything, I should be feeling bad 
for all the geese that had to die for 
this product.

The 
“Kensington” 
parka, 

priced at $775, is definitely what 
more than half of the girls at 
the University are wearing. For 
the guys, the “Carson” parka 
seems to be the popular choice. 
These jackets are so expensive 
that they’re what I would call 
an investment piece. I struggle 
to believe that this many people 
like the same exact style, in the 
same exact color (black). Let’s be 
real. The jackets aren’t actually 
flattering, they’re just formless 
parkas. The jacket is hot right 
now. For a lot of people it’s just a 
fashion statement that will grow 
old in the next couple of years. 
I applaud everyone who has 
ventured outside of these two 
types and has decided to go with 
something different.

People tend to spend money 

on things they don’t necessarily 
care for, with money they don’t 
necessarily have, just so they 
can conform to the majority. 
To me, this is sad. Please only 
buy a Canada Goose if you truly 
want one. Although I do like my 
Canada Goose vest, and have to 
admit the jackets are good quality, 
I cannot deny the fact that they’re 
incredibly overrated.

TV REVIEW

A

bout four weeks ago, 
I decided to grow 
a beard. I made my 

decision out of necessity: I 
was skiing out West where, on 
the 
first 

day of a 
six 
day 

excur-
sion, 
the 

wind 
and 
cold 

ripped 
apart 
the 
skin 

on 
my 

face 
into 

peeling, 
inflamed flakes of shedding 
epidermis. With my face burn-
ing red, tender to the touch, I 
needed some extra protection 
if I was to return to Ann Arbor 
without looking like Captain 
America’s nemesis, the Red 
Skull. After those six days, I 
decided to challenge myself 
and see how well (or poorly) 
I could get my barely visible 
bleach blonde scruff to grow. 
After a month, the results are 
satisfactory, better than I had 
predicted.

During that month, I also 

watched 10 Western films, 
old and new. Almost every 
single male character in these 
films, with the exception of 
Gary Cooper in “High Noon,” 
sports some mighty form of 
bristly, manly facial hair. Kurt 
Russell’s potent mustache in 
“Tombstone,” 
which 
grew 

even more formidable in “The 
Hateful Eight,” the rugged 
stubble 
of 
Clint 
Eastwood 

and 
Franco 
Nero 
in 
the 

“Dollars” trilogy and “Django,” 
respectively, 
Jeff 
Bridges’s 

scruffy, one-eyed sheriff in 
“True Grit” and even Leo’s 
dirty, 
disheveled, 
somewhat 

patchy mountain man look 
in “The Revenant” (which, I 
would argue, is most certainly 
a 
Western), 
all 
of 
these 

protagonists don better facial 
hair than I ever could. I find 
my own mildly bristled visage 
inadequate by comparison.

But of course, they’re actors; 

they have makeup departments 
to fix what they can’t grow, 
to make their beards and 
mustaches perfect. They are, in 
fact, perfect specimens of facial 
hair. And given their perfection 
and their pervasiveness and 
visibility, one realizes that 
facial hair has become integral 
to the Western hero. Because 
when 
I 
think 
about 
Kurt 

Russell’s Wyatt Earp without 
a mustache, he looks less 
grizzled, less haunted by his 
past as a soldiering peacekeeper 
(and it wouldn’t be historically 
accurate, but that’s beside the 
point). A clean-shaven John 
Wayne 
in 
“The 
Searchers” 

seems 
less 
desperate, 
less 

martial. And I have a hard 
enough time believing Leo 

could 
ever 
survive 
in 
the 

wilderness like Hugh Glass — 
the absence of his beard would 
make “The Revenant” beyond 
incredulous. I ask myself why 
this is.

Naturally, we can reason a 

couple explanations as to the 
characters’ beards: It’s the Wild 
West, so of course many men 
will be unkempt, since they 
have larger concerns at hand. 
And the costume and makeup 
departments likely want to 
remain historically accurate in 
the case of biopics, and many 
classic lawmen and outlaws 
grew some sort of facial hair.

But it’s very easy to write off 

these decisions to historical 
accuracy. I imagine most people 
don’t know what Hugh Glass 
and Wyatt Earp actually looked 
like, and no one would complain 
if they lacked facial hair. After 
all, film has influenced much 
of how we think about and 
perceive the West, for better or 
worse, as much as if not more 
than history itself. We have 
mythologized the West into, 
well, a Hollywood version of 
itself through years of mythic 
constructions in the 1930s and 
’40s, some deconstructions in 
the ’50s and some hyperviolent 
hyperboles in the ’60s and 
’70s (and most recently with 
“Django Unchained”). All of 
these films attack or build or 
borrow from the myth of the 
American West in a myriad 
of ways, but they are all tied 
to their bearded heroes and 
villains.

Most recently, I watched 

the 2007 remake of “3:10 to 
Yuma,” and the situation is no 
different. Christian Bale’s Dan 
Evans is an ex-Union soldier, 
who lost his leg during the 
war and a struggling farmer. 
He is tasked with escorting 
renowned outlaw Ben Wade 
(Russell Crowe) to the town of 
Contention to catch the train 
to Yuma prison. Both Bale and 
Crowe don the same short-
boxed, low-trimmed beard — 
these men are two sides of the 
same coin, a complicated mix 
of good and evil, success and 
failure, muddied by differing 
perceptions 
of 
justice. 
For 

Wade, justice is monetary, a 
give and take depending on 
actions dealt and received. 
Evans is more concrete: justice 
is honor and code, a duty to 
uphold “though the heavens 
fall,” as the saying goes. Over 
the course of the film, the two 

ideologies mesh and mingle, 
and morality and justice shift 
depending on the perspective.

That’s not to say that the 

facial hair itself dictates this 
idea, but that it links these 
two forceful characters and 
contrasts them with the others: 
the 
snooty, 
rich 
railroad 

man’s slicked moustache, the 
seasoned 
officer’s 
thicker 

mane, the out-of-his-element 
doctor’s modest moustache and 
the beardless, angry stowaway 
son of Evans. All of these other 
characters are wildly different 
from each other and serve 
mainly to highlight this central 
conflict between Evans and 
Wade, two titans of morality. It 
is here we find the heart of the 
Western.

Every tale set in the American 

West is tragic, because, in every 
case, no matter what happens, 
the 
story, 
the 
characters, 

the laws and the values will 
inevitably be left behind. But 
even in the nameless, endless 
stretches of sand and mountain 
ranges that time and progress 
will soon forget, the stakes are 
never higher. In the myth of 
the American West, a fight in 
the small town of Contention 
between two men with nothing 
in common but their beards 
can create an atmosphere rich 
with tension, so dangerous 
and fateful it might as well be 
a fight between God and the 
Devil. It’s an atmosphere that 
only the Western has been able 
to achieve so perfectly and 
consistently.

That’s 
why 
the 
Western 

will 
never 
disappear; 
our 

perceptions, 
historical 
and 

current, of good, evil, morality 
and 
justice, 
though 
they 

change and though we revise 
them through the years, are 
engrained in our consciousness, 
and engrained in the American 
Western. Even in films like 
“Unforgiven” (where the heroes 
are bearded and the villain is 
clean shaven) that completely 
reject and deconstruct the West 
for all of its ugliness. Though 
it’s a genre fixed in time, it is, in 
the end, timeless.

And 
if 
the 
Western 
is 

timeless, then so too are the 
beards that contribute to its 
ethos. I like to believe that the 
emphasis placed on a strong 
beard in these films is not due to 
the lack of cheap Gillette razors 
but to the evocation of the battle 
for justice and a bygone way of 
life that the beard symbolizes. I 
can only hope to one day honor 
that ethos, and grow something 
that might make Kurt Russell 
proud. 

This is a story of a boy and 

his beard. If you’d swipe right,

ALBUM REVIEW
Emotive ‘EVOL’ 
a win for Future

Artist serves 

another success 

with latest

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

With an onslaught of Future 

music comes an onslaught of 
cheesy emojis. There was the 
diamond 
for 

What a Time 
to 
Be 
Alive, 

the 
purple 

umbrella 
for 

Purple 
Reign, 

and 
now 

the rose and 
fire 
emojis 

for 
EVOL 

(pronounced “evil”), Future’s 
newest album. After premiering 
on DJ Khaled’s new Beats 1 
radio show, fans were quick to 
dutifully 
litter 
ex-girlfriend 

Ciara’s 
Instagram 
with 
the 

emoticons and shout “Fire!” 
throughout the Twitter-sphere.

But the pettiness of these 

social media gimmicks does 
injustice to the Atlanta rapper’s 
rapidly expanding discography. 
His relentless pace of releases 
over the last year and a half has 
been nearly unparalleled, and 
is a refreshing contrast for fans 
given the recent trend of major 
artists holding back and cutting 
down 
on 
their 
production. 

EVOL, coming just three weeks 
after Purple Reign, is his latest 
solid release of smoky-room trap.

“Low Life,” the first taste 

of the album, was released 
on Christmas and features a 
characteristically 
dark 
and 

murky collaboration with The 
Weeknd, an artist who talks 
about drugs almost as much as 
Future does. It’s predictable, 
but that’s not necessarily a bad 
thing. “I just took some molly, 
what 
else?” 
Future 
states, 

acknowledging that we should 
be fully aware of the life he lives 
at this point. He doesn’t need 
to advertise — this is common 

knowledge. This complete self-
awareness is obvious through the 
track.

That release set the tone for 

EVOL. There’s nothing here 
that we haven’t heard before. 
As expected, the album is 
filled with prescription drug 
references 
(“Promethazine/

codeine this shit champagne for 
us”) and subliminal Ciara disses 
(“I know you ain’t saving that 
pussy / You know somebody 
play in that pussy”). Still, EVOL 
manages to keep its head above 
the sea of strong Future releases 
and stake its own claim.

“Xanny 
Family” 
captures 

the aesthetic of the album 
particularly 
well. 
Melodic 

rapping, 
hallucinogenic 

production and constant tempo 
push this track forward. It’s a 
hedonistic night of debauchery 
during which Future takes just 
enough time to look around, 
comment on his surroundings, 
and 
move 
on. 
The 
entire 

album is the same, hardly ever 
slowing. Where his last release 
Purple Reign put on the brakes 
with “Perkys Calling,” a ballad 
of sorts, EVOL powers through 
for 40 minutes without sign of 
letting up.

With this relentless pace, 

Future leaves behind the syrupy 
dissatisfaction that consumed 
DS2, his critically acclaimed 
album from last year. On “Kno 
the Meaning” from DS2, he stops 
rapping and simply talks over a 
quiet piano note, explaining the 
context of his mixtape 56 Nights. 
He follows this with the croon 
“there’s so much more I gotta 
endure.” Drug addiction and 
meaningless sex weighed heavily 

on Future on that album, and it 
was a cry for help masked with 
trap production. EVOL removes 
the lament and sees Future full-
heartedly embracing that foggy 
world.

Future comes to own his 

rapping style here as well. His 
skill has always been in delivery 
and memorable one-liners, and 
EVOL doesn’t disappoint on this 
end. “You n****s don’t exist, 
we eat filet mignon” is a clear 
example from “Photo Copied.” 
What does that even mean? 
Regardless, it’ll stick with you 
afterward.

Stylistically, EVOL has close 

ties to “March Madness,” the 
single from 56 Nights. “Fly 
Shit Only” recalls it especially, 
angry and pummeling headfirst, 
but with an added cinematic 
feel. Future is looking down 
on 
the 
world 
from 
above 

(“JET DOUGH”), listing off 
the reasons why he’s the “only 
one that’s ballin.” That kind 
of 
outer-worldly 
quality 
is 

honed throughout this album. 
Take the track “Photo Copied,” 
an ex-girlfriend diss. While 
lyrically it’s relatively petty, 
it manages to transcend with 
production that punctures the 
air like some kind of alien-space 
ship.

Apparently no longer bridled 

with the intense emotional pain 
of DS2, Future’s latest album is 
above all a victory lap. “Seven 
Rings” establishes this album 
as the latest trophy in the line 
of his six previous. On track 
“Lie to Me” Future yells “I’m a 
motherfucking boss,” and while 
it’s only track eight, it feels like 
the final statement that this 
album leaves off with. There’s 
no “I think I went over my limit” 
here — Future has no limit.

Adding yet another ring to 

his hand, Future gives his fans 
everything they could ask for. 
And while the formula will 
inevitably become tired, EVOL 
is fresh enough to keep us 
interested.

VICE takes on ISIS

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The Islamic State dominates 

our headlines. It’s impossible to 
ignore the stories that circulate 
every week, on 
the front pages 
of our newspa-
pers and pop-
ping up on our 
timelines 
and 

newsfeeds. 
Despite 
the 

seemingly end-
less wealth of 
information and 
current events, 
it can be dif-
ficult to find a 
comprehensive 
version of the 
“truth,” or a place to begin learn-
ing about the complicated sub-
ject matter. “Vice Special Report: 
Fighting ISIS” which aired on 
HBO on Jan. 31 offers a balanced, 
well-formulated introduction to 
what ISIS is, how it formed, how 
it’s operating today and how other 
groups are fighting against it.

The report begins with old 

footage of American politicians 
— including an extra-long shot of 
former president George W. Bush 
— and then an interview with 
a captured ISIS jihadist (name 
withheld). VICE correspondent 
Ben Anderson explores the build-
up and subsequent execution of 
the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, 
and talks to members of rebel 
groups in Iraq, captured ISIS 

jihadists in Kurdistan and even 
military forces in Syria. The one-
on-one interviews are intriguing 
but too short; there’s not enough 
time given after the build-up to 
let us fully establish a read on any 
single figure, including a captured 
Sunni Jihadist (name withheld) 
and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, 
a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq.

The balance between the emo-

tional pull of the subject matter 
and the focus on mapping out an 
informational and accurate por-
trayal of the history of ISIS and 
its current conflicts is aided by 
Anderson’s journalistic style in 
interviewing his subjects. He is 
calm and professional, and press-
es for answers that are more com-
plex than the ones he is initially 
given.

Anderson pushes his interview-

ees on what the future looks like, 
looking at it especially through a 
global lens as the Western world 
doubles down on fighting terror-
ism transnationally. One of the 
tensest moments of the special is 
when the journalist asks, “Is the 
U.S. more likely to face an attack 
from Iraqi soil today than it was 
under Saddam (Hussein)?” The 
short answer, according to mul-
tiple sources, is yes.

Though 
the 
percussive 

soundtrack throughout the report 
is usually unnecessary, as the nar-
ration is fascinating enough, it’s 
only mildly distracting. The audio 
of the interviews is clear and 
clean, and the voiceover is sharp, 
flowing smoothly over the busier 

background noise. The emphasis 
isn’t on Anderson’s travels into a 
dangerous area — though there 
are a few times in which he has 
to move due to circumstances 
involving sniper gunfire — but 
rather on the different groups of 
people he interviews.

“Fighting ISIS” has a rating 

of TV-MA, and for good reason. 
There’s footage of people being 
forced down on their faces with 
bags over the heads, people fall-
ing from gunshots, beheadings 
and children putting guns against 
the heads of prisoners. There are 
also a few minutes of interviews 
with women who have been vic-
tims of ISIS, giving space to show 
how families are torn apart by the 
conflicts. Luckily, these shots and 
interviews don’t read as manipu-
lative — though they easily could. 
They’re difficult to watch because 
of the fact that there is often 
nothing between the camera and 
the horrific events taking place; 
because they’re not overdramatic 
or exploitative, there’s nothing to 
point to to release the tension of 
those shots.

Though the report as a whole 

is fairly comprehensive, the end 
feels gimmicky. It returns to 
familiar rhetoric about terrorism 
and 9/11, news clips about the Nov. 
2015 Paris attacks and an ominous 
warning about the future looking 
grim. Though “Fighting ISIS” 
isn’t a superbly fleshed out repre-
sentation of the battle against ISIS 
and those who are on the front 
lines, it’s a fair introduction.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Preferring Panama

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

I’ve been tracking Panama 

Wedding’s progress for about a 
year now. For those of you who 
don’t know, Panama Wedding 
is 
an 
electronic/alternative/

pop band based in Manhattan. 
Initially comprised of now-
lead singer Peter Kirk and his 
computer, 
Panama 
Wedding 

has since expanded into a 
full ensemble with a rhythm 
section. Kirk began his musical 
career as a classically trained 
pianist before turning to synth-
based music in his later years.

After releasing their debut 

EP, Parallel Play, in 2014, 
Panama 
Wedding 
amassed 

nationwide 
attention. 
Now, 

its second and most recent EP 
released in November 2015, Into 
Focus, has launched the band 
into a broader public sphere.

Into Focus starts off with 

“Halfway 
to 
Heaven,” 
an 

artificially produced track that 
emphasizes complicated beats 
and a strong vocal presence. 
The 
swelling 
chorus 
uses 

a heavy electric guitar and 
strong drumbeat to convey 
the storyline while the verses 
are faded and focused around 
Kirk’s voice. Kirk explains his 
own fears in the lyrics, “Wide 
awake in the middle of the 
desert heat / 100 miles to New 
Mexico / With the devil in my 
limousine.”

“Infinite 
High” 
has 
a 

softer, quieter electronic feel 
and sounds evoking summer 
sunsets and warm night drives. 
Its driving force is a steady 
beat with organic hand claps, 
while the chorus creates layers 
of multiple vocals to produce a 
larger band feel without losing 
intimacy 
with 
the 
listener. 

“Infinite High” speaks to being 
unsure of your place in life when 
Kirk sings, “And its getting all 
too much / Your life is getting 
hard / Living month to month 
on a credit card.”

Kirk’s most personal song on 

the EP, “Into Focus,” addresses 

his struggles of balancing work 
and music and how he overcame 
those 
difficulties. 
Starting 

slow with echoing beats and 
a repetitive guitar riff, Kirk 
sings, “I’m amazed why you 
would believe in me,” speaking 
to all of those without faith 
in themselves. He continues, 
“I’ve been working all day long 
/ I’ve been working out of my 
mind / Waiting for my thoughts 
to shape into focus.” It has a 
dance sound without feeling 
too electronic and lends a 
reassuring message to all those 
doubting their own focus.

My personal favorite track, “A 

Brand New Life,” has an upbeat 
underlying force pushing the 
song 
forward. 
It 
considers 

leaving everything behind and 
setting off for a fresh start. 
(Does that not sound great right 
now?) Kirk deals with being 
cheated by life plans when he 
sings, “I didn’t know / This was 
the ending I was sold.” With a 
sound extremely similar to The 
1975, “A Brand New Life” lays 
out dreams and hopes for the 
audience to share like, “I wanna 
live on the north shore / I wanna 
cut my hair.” The bridge is 
comprised of simple claps and a 
piano before the chorus returns 
one final time, driving home the 
point of leaving behind a life 
you’re unhappy with.

The closing song, “Younger 

Love,” is constituted of simple 
electric guitar and synth. It 
uses 
fewer 
instruments 
to 

demonstrate stripping yourself 
of all worldly stereotypes and 
understanding that we are all 
the same. Kirk concludes his 
EP by singing, “Isn’t it a small 
world? / Isn’t it a strange time? 
/ How we’re all forced to smile 
to each other.”

With just under 7,000 Twitter 

followers, Panama Wedding is 
by no means a household name, 
but by steadily expanding its fan 
base and consistently churning 
out 
quality 
music, 
Panama 

Wedding can expect continued 
and widespread success.

Senior outfielder Kelsey Susalla hit .380 with 14 home runs last season.
Veteran outfield 
to lead Michigan

Lawrence, Susalla, 
Christner all return 
to pack Wolverines’ 

prolific lineup

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

As 
the 
No. 
2 
Michigan 

softball team begins its season 
this weekend, its outfield will be 
crucial to its success.

The Wolverines’ outfield will 

lead the team both on offense 
and off the field, helping to 
motivate younger players. All 
three starting outfielders return 
from last season’s second-place 
finish in the Women’s College 
World Series and look to improve 
on last season’s performance.

After spending her freshman 

year on the bench, only getting 
occasional 
opportunities 

to 
pinch-

hit, 
junior 

outfielder 
Kelly 
Christner 
flourished 
in 

her first year 
as a starter. 
She 
finished 

second 
on 

the team in 
a variety of 
categories 
including home runs, supporting 
an offense that led the nation 
with 118.

“My main focus my freshman 

year was really (on each) pitch,” 
Christner said. “I came in for 
pinch-hit at bats, so I really had 
to focus on every single pitch. 
Last year my main focus was my 
confidence, and that really helped 
me excel to the next level.”

Playing alongside Christner 

in the outfield will be two 
seniors, 
Kelsey 
Susalla 
and 

Sierra Lawrence.

Like Christner, Susalla also 

thrived in her first year with 
regular playing time, finishing 
third on the team in batting 
average and RBI. Susalla also 
garnered 
tremendous 
praise 

from Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins about her work ethic 
and dedication.

“(Susalla) 
didn’t 
quite 
get 

the accolades that (Christner) 
did, but she was critical to our 
success,” Hutchins said. “She 
came from being a walk-on who 
had (few) at-bats as a freshman 
and sophomore to our starting 
outfielder who was on the All-
American ballot and All-Big Ten.”

Lawrence is one of just two 

four-year starters on the roster. 
Last season, she led the team 
in stolen bases and played in 
at least 50 games for the third 
year in a row. She also was 
perfect in the field, not making 
a single error.

Lawrence knows the tools 

for a successful team, and 
along with her fellow seasoned 
outfielders, she aims to assist 

the younger players, who have 
just 
begun 
their 
Wolverine 

softball journeys.

“Me and the upperclassmen, 

we’ve done great job of coaching 
the 
underclassmen 
and 
the 

freshmen we have out there,” 
Lawrence said. “I think it’s a 
big role that we all have to step 
up and do, and we have some 
freshmen out there who need to 
do some learning for when I step 
down or if they need to come in 
this season.”

Michigan gains two new 

freshmen in its outfield corps 
this season, Natalie Peters and 
Courtney 
Richardson, 
who 

were both named to their all-
conference teams in high school.

Hutchins 
enjoys 
coaching 

freshmen 
because 
of 
their 

commitment to improving and 
assisting the team.

“Freshmen come every day 

excited to be here,” Hutchins 
said. “This freshman class, I’ve 

loved from the 
get-go. There’s 
a lot of them, 
and they stick 
together as a 
group. They’re 
enthusiastic. I 
like that pack 
mentality. 
They take care 
of each other.”

Christner 

explained 

that the elder players will 
do whatever it takes to ease 
the challenging transition of 
college softball — be it extra 
batting practice or a simple 
conversation.

Perhaps because she knows 

from experience the importance 
of taking advantage of every 
opportunity, Christner is always 
eager to help a young player 
with extra reps.

“Sometimes you can just see 

the look on people’s faces that 
they’re having a bad day and go up 
and talk to them,” Christner said. 
“I think it helps them calm their 
nerves just because they do have a 
lot on their plate, and we do know 
what it’s like being a freshman 
coming into this program.”

When asked about keys to 

Michigan’s season, Christner 
believes the team must remain 
upbeat and enthusiastic. If she 
is determined to succeed, she 
feels it will carry over to the 
other players.

“Whenever I wasn’t confident 

last year, that’s when I didn’t do 
well,” Christner said. “If I have 
energy on the field, I think I 
bring everyone else up, and then 
we all have energy.”

Hutchins remains confident 

in the leadership of her veteran 
outfielders. The three will give the 
Wolverines the best opportunity 
possible to win games.

If 
Christner 
and 
Susalla 

can 
repeat 
their 
breakout 

seasons and Lawrence remains 
consistent, Michigan will have 
many wins to look forward to in 
the coming months.

“We’ve done 
a great job of 
coaching the 

underclassmen.”

Michigan healthy, stronger 
after productive offseason

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

was certainly disappointed to 
end last season with a loss to 
Louisville at the 2015 Super 
Regionals. But with that defeat, 
coming 
against 
a 
perennial 

contender and the preseason 
No. 2 team in the country this 
year, Michigan had caught the 
nation’s eye and was catapulted 
into an offseason in which it has 
earned more recognition than 
any Big Ten team is accustomed 
to seeing.

The Wolverines, ranked 15th 

according to Baseball America’s 
preseason rankings, have taken 
the offseason as an opportunity 
to get healthy and stronger in an 
attempt to build on last year’s 
impressive ending.

Senior left-hander Evan Hill 

was forced to miss a large chunk 
of last season with an anterior 
cruciate 
ligament 
injury, 

appearing in just 11 games. Hill 
says the offseason has helped 
him tremendously, and that his 
knee is 100 percent heading into 
the team’s season opener Feb. 19.

Playing on a weakened ACL in 

2015, Hill still managed to fan 37 
batters in 38 innings of work.

Junior left-handed pitcher/

first baseman Carmen Benedetti, 
who was named to the preseason 
All-American third team, has also 
been trying to improve himself 
physically in recent months. 

“His growth is impressive,” 

said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“(Benedetti) was a slow runner 
his first year, kind of an average 
runner last year, now he’s like a 
speedster on the bases.”

Benedetti and Hill, as well 

as junior pitcher Brett Adcock, 
were able to work on their game 

while playing in the competitive 
Cape Cod Baseball League over 
the summer. All three put up 
impressive numbers.

Hill posted a 1.80 ERA and 

a 5-0 record for Wareham, 
and Adcock helped Yarmouth-
Dennis to a league title, going 
3-1 with 26 strikeouts in 37.1 
innings.

Benedetti 

was able to 
work on his 
pitching 
as 

well. He went 
to Cape Cod 
with 
two 

pitches 
and 

came 
back 

with 
three, 

adding 
a 

breaking ball 
to go with his changeup and 
mid-90s fastball.

When 
Michigan’s 
players 

returned to campus at the end 

of summer, normally the team 
would have a couple of months 
of fall ball before bringing 
everything indoors. But this 
winter has not been typical. 
Mild weather has allowed the 
Wolverines to practice outdoors 
at Ray Fisher Stadium about 10 
to 15 times since their winter 

training 
started.

That’s 

compared 
to 

last 
winter, 

in which they 
managed 
to 

scrimmage on 
a snowy, half-
frozen field for 
two 
days 
in 

January.

“We’ve been 

outside more in the last three 
weeks than maybe the last three 
years combined,” Bakich said.

Bakich and his team are excited 

to have had a prolonged fall 
season and extra reps outside this 
winter, saying it has been a great 
benefit for the team. Still, despite 
some milder weather, the team 
is more than ready to fly down 
to Florida and kick off its season 
next weekend in the warmth.

“Everyone wants to get out 

of the cold a little,” Hill said. 
“I think I can speak for all the 
returning guys and say that we’re 
pretty anxious to get out there.”

There’s been a lot of talk 

surrounding 
the 
Wolverines 

so far this year. And after an 
already experienced lineup has 
taken big strides this offseason, 
the publicity is well deserved. 
Michigan has been dead set on 
working hard and improving, 
all through the summer, the fall 
and even into the winter. But 
now, nine days from the season 
opener, Michigan baseball is 
ready for spring.

Junior Nicole Artz helped power Michigan to a season-high score of 197.425 by winning the all-around title with a season-high score of 39.550 on Monday.

Artz shines in Michigan’s tri-meet

By LANEY BYLER

Daily Sports Writer

Known 
for 
her 
bubbly 

personality and energetic floor 
routines, junior team captain 
Nicole Artz was expected to 
make a splash at the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics tri-meet.

She didn’t fail to deliver.
With Michigan facing Eastern 

Michigan and Maryland, Artz’s 
biggest competition came from 
fellow Wolverines — junior Talia 
Chiarelli, freshman Olivia Karas 
and sophomore Brianna Brown. 
Despite the strong competition 
from 
her 
teammates, 
Artz 

maintained her position as a 
constant threat. On the floor 
exercise, she took first place 
with a 9.925.

Artz has a reputation for the 

consistency in her dismounts, 
and 
she 
reinforced 
this 

reputation in almost every event. 
She stuck landings throughout 
her entire floor routine, as well 
as on the bars and beam. She 
took a minor step back when 

landing her vault, which put 
her at a tie for eighth place with 
Eastern Michigan’s Kimberly 
Ebeyer with a score of 9.800.

“I just like to take it one 

thing at a time. You can’t get 
ahead of yourself,” Artz said. 
“If something 
does mess up, 
you can’t dwell 
on it, you just 
have to move 
on. So it’s just 
staying in the 
moment 
and 

focusing 
on 

what you did 
in practice.”

Despite the 

lower ranking 
in vault, which was the first 
event of the day, Artz was able to 
make a comeback and outscore 
her opponents with her 9.925 on 
floor and a 9.900 on the uneven 
bars, where she tied for third. 
She also snagged second on the 
beam with a score of 9.925, a 
season high.

These high scores led to 

another all-around first-place 
result for Artz, who ended the 
meet with an overall score of 
39.550. With a previous best all-
around of 39.525, Artz earned 
another season best. It was also 
Artz’s 20th score above 39.000 

in her career — 
the 12th-most 
in 
Michigan 

history.

“She 
is 
a 

great 
leader 

on our team,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Bev 

Plocki, 
“because 
she 

really 
does 

demonstrate 

that work ethic, and the desire 
to win, and the competitiveness 
and those things that make her 
great.”

Artz’s high scores and flooring 

routines rarely go unnoticed — 
she was named Big Ten Gymnast 
of the Week on Tuesday, her 
third time gaining recognition 
for her dominant performances 

in every event. She is also on the 
Big Ten Gymnasts to Watch list.

“She 
is 
driven, 
both 

gymnastically 
and 

academically,” 
Plocki 
said. 

“In everything she does, she 
is driven, but she doesn’t take 
herself too seriously either. It’s 
kind of a good mix, because 
sometimes if you’re too much of 
a perfectionist, you’re too hard 
on yourself.

“She’s a really good mix of 

she’s got that drive and desire 
to want to be perfect, which 
means she works really hard,

Senior guard Caris LeVert has missed 10 straight games with a leg injury, but did practice for an hour Monday.
Wolverines head 
back on the road

With LeVert still on 
the mend, Michigan 

visits woeful 

Golden Gophers

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan men’s basketball 

coach John Beilein keeps a 
ledger of how many practices 
his team has had and how many 
more 
it 
has 

left. Entering 
Tuesday, 
the 

count read 82 
down, 
18 
to 

go. It’s not a 
countdown 
to the end of 
the 
season, 

he says, but a 
way to keep 
track of how 
much time the 
Wolverines 
(7-3 Big Ten, 
17-6 
overall) 

have 
to 

improve.

After a rough week at home 

in which Michigan got played 
out of its own arena twice 
— first by Indiana and then 
by Michigan State — Beilein 
probably wishes the number in 
the second column was greater. 
With the Big Ten Tournament 
in just four weeks, Beilein is 
tasked with turning around 
a team that’s headed in the 
wrong direction after getting a 
reality check last week.

“You only seem to be as good 

as your last game, and that just 
weighs on you,” Beilein said 
Tuesday. “And we weren’t very 
good our last two games. … You 
just got to keep trying to refresh 
yourself and get better, but you 
have to get a win somewhere 

along the line again to feel good. 
Any type of win at any place 
against anybody.”

Lucky 
for 
Beilein 
and 

the 
Wolverines, 
their 
next 

opportunity for a win comes 
Wednesday 
night 
against 

Minnesota. 
The 
Golden 

Gophers (0-11, 6-17) still haven’t 
won a conference game and 
haven’t won a game at all since 
Dec. 16. However, Minnesota 
has played a handful of tight 
games over the last month 
despite being unable to turn 
any into wins.

Since falling to Michigan 

in Ann Arbor three weeks 
ago, the Golden Gophers have 
hung in against the likes of 
Illinois, Purdue and Indiana. 
They 
forced 
a 
21st-ranked 

Boilermakers team into a game 
that came down to the final 
seconds and nearly took down 
a 19th-ranked 
Hoosiers 
squad 
on 

the 
road 
a 

few 
days 

later 
before 

ultimately 
falling, 74-68. 
But Thursday, 
Minnesota 
still 
proved 

extremely 
vulnerable, 
getting 
blown 
out 
by 
an 

unimpressive 
Northwestern 

team.

In its meeting earlier this 

year, Michigan squeezed out a 
74-69 win despite lacking energy 
on the court and shooting just 37 
percent from the field. Another 
lackluster 
effort 
could 
still 

potentially earn a win for the 
Wolverines — Minnesota shoots 
just 41 percent as a team — but 
after two sluggish showings last 
week, another would add to a 
list of problems Michigan has 
faced lately.

Despite 
the 
two 
straight 

losses, Beilein says team morale 
isn’t down.

“(There’s been) really good 

energy in practice, and there’s 
nobody hanging their heads 
in practice,” Beilein said. “The 
attitude is good as far as getting 
the improvement. How we’re 
getting there is so slow, and 
that’s what’s so frustrating.”

Also 
frustrating 
for 

Michigan is the extended time 
senior 
guard 
Caris 
LeVert 

has missed with a lower left 
leg injury. The All-American 
candidate has missed 10 games 
since suffering the injury on 
Dec. 30. Beilein hasn’t been 
specific about a timetable for 
his potential return but offered 
more optimistic news Tuesday, 
including that LeVert practiced 
for an hour Monday and is 
pain-free. Beilein also said that 

the 
decision 

as 
to 
when 

he returns is 
completely 
up to LeVert 
and 
could 

even come as 
late as during 
Michigan’s 
shootaround 
Wednesday.

“We’ll 
go 

into practice 

today, and we’ll have some 
actions for him defensively 
and offensively that he’s got to 
learn, and then you just don’t 
know what it’s going to be like,” 
Beilein said. “It’s extremely 
important that he plays when 
he’s ready to play and that he’s 
not risking any further injury. 
So it’s a puzzle.”

With 
just 
17 
practices 

remaining after Tuesday’s, the 
time to put the pieces together 
and assemble a finished product 
that qualifies for the NCAA 
Tournament is running out.

Home stretch will ease up on ‘M’

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The schedule makers didn’t 

take it easy on the Michigan 
women’s basketball team.

A heavily front-loaded Big Ten 

schedule — with the toughest 
games in the first half of the 
conference season — has put the 
Wolverines (5-7 Big Ten, 13-10 
overall) in a hole that may not 
be indicative of how good they 
actually are. 

Currently in 10th place in the 

Big Ten, Michigan has just six 
games left to boost its standing 
ahead of the Big Ten Tournament.

One of those games is against 

Maryland, the No. 6 team in 
the country, but beyond that, 
the 
Wolverines 
still 
have 

matchups against opponents like 
Northwestern, Wisconsin, Penn 
State and Rutgers, which are all 
below or even with Michigan in 
the conference standings.

The remaining game pits the 

Wolverines against Purdue. The 
Boilermakers 
opened 
up 
the 

Big Ten season in Ann Arbor on 
Dec. 31, narrowly leaving Crisler 
Center with a win after hitting a 
go-ahead 3-pointer in the last six 
seconds. Michigan had the chance 
to tie it from the line, but freshman 
Boogie Brozoski hit only one of 
three free throws.

Michigan’s two best players, 

sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty and freshman center 
Hallie Thome, both said Sunday 
that they were looking forward 
to finishing this campaign strong, 
touching on its importance leading 
up to the postseason.

“I’m excited to try and play 

Maryland again,” Flaherty said. 
“Rutgers, going home is always 
fun. Purdue, we lost in the last 
second. 
Each 

game, I think 
we 
can 
win 

every 
single 

game we have 
left, and I think 
if we do, it 
will really be a 
turning 
point 

with us. 

“I think we 

really 
could 

win the Big Ten 
Tournament, and I think it’ll come 
down to if we go in there with 
momentum.”

Maryland, of course, is the 

toughest 
opponent 
left 
on 

the schedule, but even in the 
Wolverines’ seven-point loss back 
on Jan. 14, they hung around until 
the Terrapins sealed it with free 
throws late in the game.

On the road, there’s no question 

it will be a tougher matchup, but 
there is still no reason to believe 
Michigan couldn’t finish out the 
Big Ten with a winning record.

The Wolverines don’t have to 

worry about Ohio State, Nebraska 
or Michigan State until they 
potentially meet these teams 
again in Indianapolis the first 
week of March.

“Our schedule, the first half, 

was a tough one,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “But 
we don’t want to look past any 
opponent.

“We try not 

to 
emphasize 

(the schedule) 
too 
much, 

because 
we 

don’t 
want 

them to think 
that 
anything 

is easy. So this 
part is not easy, 
I mean, because 
just how could 
you lose on any 

given night … So the kids know, 
they read (the Daily), they read the 
paper and they read the Internet. 
They know who’s really good and 
who’s not, but I don’t emphasize 
that too much.”

The Big Ten Tournament begins 

March 2, when the four lowest-
ranked teams in the conference 
play each other for the chance to 
advance to the next day. Michigan 
stands ahead of that pack for now, 
and over the next three weeks, 
it will do everything it can to 
separate itself even further.

Sophomore guard Katelynn Flaherty is confident Michigan can still beat each of the six teams left on its schedule.

‘M’ tied atop Big Ten

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

Just over half of the Big Ten 

hockey season is in the books, and 
the conference is split into two 
distinct camps.

Michigan, 
Minnesota 
and 

Penn State have separated from 
the pack as the only teams left in 
real contention for the regular-
season crown and the No. 1 seed 
in the conference tournament. 
Ohio State, Michigan State and 
Wisconsin are lagging far behind 
— a discouraging result for the 
conference in its fourth year.

The Daily breaks down each 

team below.

The Contenders

Michigan (8-2-2-1 Big Ten, 17-4-

4 overall)

The sixth-ranked Wolverines 

tore 
through 
the 
last 
four 

conference series despite a miscue 
Friday night in Detroit. Michigan 
dropped an overtime heartbreaker 
to Michigan State in that game, but 
hasn’t recorded a regulation loss 
since Dec. 12 against Minnesota.

In that stretch, the forward 

line of freshman Kyle Connor and 
juniors JT Compher and Tyler 
Motte has become perhaps the 
most elite in all of college hockey. 
The 
offensive 
explosion 
was 

complemented by better cohesion 
in the defensive zone and a marked 
improvement by senior netminder 
Steve Racine.

The run has propelled the 

Wolverines to a tie with the Golden 
Gophers atop the Big Ten standings. 
Both teams have 27 points and will 
meet in Minneapolis again in late 
February.

Minnesota (9-3-0, 14-13-0)

The Golden Gophers used Big 

Ten play to salvage what looked to 
be a lost season, but they’ll need to 
do more for any chance to play in 
the NCAA Tournament.

Heading 
into 
December, 

and the first conference series, 
Minnesota was 4-7. Now above 
.500, the Gophers are tied for the 
lead in the Big Ten despite lacking 
a true quality win.

They split four games with Penn 

State, but those two wins are the 
most impressive in a schedule that 
was packed with tough opponents. 
Minnesota’s strength of schedule 
is sixth in the nation, but that 
alone isn’t enough to combat the 
dismal season record.

The 
Gophers 
are 
still 
in 

contention for the regular-season 
title for two reasons. The first 
is 
freshman 
goaltender 
Eric 

Schierhorn, who has a .915 save 
percentage and is ranked third in 
the conference. The other reason 
is the ridiculous rate at which 
the team is converting shots into 
goals. The team’s .125 shooting 
percentage in conference play is 
tremendous, tied with Michigan’s 
prolific offense.

The Gophers have a chance 

to make up some ground in the 
national rankings with two home 
games left against Michigan, but 
will still likely require a first-
place finish in the conference 
tournament to sniff a chance at 
the postseason.

Penn State (7-5, 17-8-3)

The Nittany Lions are sitting 

in third place, six points back in 
the Big Ten regular-season race 
despite a No. 15 ranking in the 
national poll.

After a blistering start to the 

season, Penn State squandered 
an opportunity to climb the Big 
Ten leaderboard in its series with 
Michigan. The Nittany Lions lost 
by a score of 13-7 in that weekend, 
putting the team’s postseason 
hopes in serious jeopardy.

NCAA 
at-large 
teams 
are 

generally representatives from the 
top 10 of the RPI, and that leaves 
Penn State on the outside looking in.

Coach 
Guy 
Gadowsky 
has 

puzzled many with his decisions in 

net, though. Freshman goaltender 
Eamon McAdam owns a .923 save 
percentage this year, but continues 
to split time with Matt Skoff. Skoff 
is a senior with a significantly 
poorer goals-against average (3.18) 
and save percentage (.900).

The Bottom Feeders

Ohio State (3-5-2-1, 8-14-2)

Sitting in fourth place, you could 

say the Buckeyes are exceeding 
expectations this season. But the 
team has managed just three wins 
in conference play — such is the 
state of Big Ten hockey.

Ohio State is a better team than 

its 1-7 start to the season indicated, 
though. An upset win against 
Penn State and another against 
Michigan, this one by shootout, 
are marquee wins for a program 
that isn’t historically strong.

Michigan State (3-9-0, 7-19-2)

A win over Michigan at Joe 

Louis Arena on Friday night 
and another respectable contest 
against 
the 
Wolverines 
on 

Saturday may mark a turning tide 
for the Spartans, but it is certainly 
too little, too late.

After finishing second in the 

Big Ten last year, winning the 
conference tournament is now 
Michigan State’s only chance of 
making the postseason —and that 
seems like a long shot.

Wisconsin (1-7-2-1, 6-12-6)

It has been a dismal two years 

for the Badgers’ hockey program. 
After winning just four games 
last year, Wisconsin opened this 
season with a six-game winless 
stretch and never recovered.

Wisconsin’s best result of the 

season came early, in a 3-1 win over 
No. 3 North Dakota. Since then, 
the Badgers have shown few signs 
of life, and it is anyone’s guess how 
the program will recover from a 
historically awful two-year run.

MARCO RUBIO
ON THE 
RECORD

“We are taking our message to families that are struggling 
to raise their children in the 21st Century, because as you 

saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 

21st Century.”

— U.S Sen. MARCO RUBIO (R-Fla) on raising children today 

during a campaign rally in Nashua, New Hampshire.

***

“And we know how hard it’s become to instill our values 
in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our 

throats.”

—RUBIO at the same rally in Nashua, in the next sentence.

***

“In the 21st Century, it’s become harder than ever to instill 
in your children the values they teach in our homes and in 
our church, instead of the values that they try to ram down 
our throats in the movies, in music and in popular culture.”

—RUBIO at the same rally, in the very next sentence.

Copy That: A Love Letter to the Em-Dash

I

’ve been told that I use too many dashes. My high school AP Language and Composi-
tion teacher would often draw an X through each dash I used in my essays, suggest-
ing that they detracted from the message I was trying to convey. In peer review — in 

both high school and college — my peers have frequently written in workshop letters, 
“Why do you use so many dashes where you could just use commas?” I’ve never listened 
to them, though — without a dash, my sentences wouldn’t convey the same meaning. 
They wouldn’t elicit the same pause in the reader’s head, and they wouldn’t set the sec-
tions of the sentence apart from each other in the same way. Plus, commas are overused. 
I have an aversion to the unnecessary comma — even if the sentence is grammatically 
correct, a comma should never be used when it doesn’t need to be. When in doubt, I go 
with the dash.

 
I have a confession, though. Until I started working at the Daily, I didn’t know 

what an em-dash was. Sure, I had seen them, but I thought it was just a different font, or 
something, that some authors knew about and I didn’t. The dash I used in my high school 
and early college essays was the en-dash – the one that’s in-between the hyphen and the 
em-dash (and the one I used in this sentence). It’s easier to make — you just type a word, 
a space, a dash, another space, and then continue on with your sentence. It’s much more 
intuitive than the “option-shift-dash” that makes the em-dash. After just a couple shifts 
at the Daily, though, I found that I’d been converted. The em-dash came naturally to me, 
and it just looked better. It had the effect I’d desired but never quite got out of the en-dash: 
It was longer, and it gave the emphasis that I wanted to force my readers to notice. What 
I’m trying to say here is that I’m in love with the em-dash. This seems like the right time 
to switch forms — specifically, to the form of a love letter.

Dear em-dash,
 
 I love you. You are my favorite type of punctuation. I’m not just saying you’re 

the best type of dash — that’s obvious. I’m saying you’re better than every single punc-
tuation mark. Commas, semi-colons, periods — all of them. Periods are necessary, sure, 
but they lack personality. Commas are too plentiful. Everyone uses them; they’re boring 
now — they have no allure. And semi-colons are replaceable — I can’t think of a time 
when a semi-colon couldn’t be replaced by an em-dash or period to strengthen the sen-
tence. That leaves you, em-dash. My one true love. I don’t care if my professors don’t like 
you or my classmates tell me to leave you for someone else. I’m going to keep using you. 
Don’t take that the wrong way — I need you, em-dash. I know we’ve only known each 
other for two years, but I’m committed to you, I promise. You’ll be a part of my life as long 
as the alt-shift-dash MacBook shortcut exists.

Love always, 
Alexis

ello. My name is Mike Flynn, as you can probably tell by that little line of 
text that says “by Mike Flynn.” But I digress. (Wow. Digressing within 
the first three sentences? That is some lazy writing. But I digress.) I’ve 

been doing stand-up comedy for a year and a half, and it’s evolved into one of the 
all-consuming passions of my life. (Hey, it’s better than crack, right?) As I edge 
closer and closer to the much sought after year-and-five-months milestone, I’ve 
found myself in a reflective mood, thinking about some of the major moments of 
my comedy not-even-close-to-career.

September 2014
I perform stand-up for the first time at the LOL ROFL Comedy Club mass 

meeting. I tell a joke that gets no laughs. I tell another joke that gets no laughs. 
I begin to tell a third joke, but I forget the punchline. Doesn’t matter. It likely 
would have gotten no laughs.

Naturally, I return the following week.

October 2014
I tell an AIDS joke at a Metal Frat open mic, and learn the hard way how 

important it is to read the room.

January 2015
I write my first good joke, and pat myself on the back, confident that my days 

of bad joke-writing are behind me.

The next day, I write a bunch of very bad jokes. It becomes clear to me that this 

shit is harder than it looks.

I am introduced to the UnClub, where Michigan’s best comics go to tell their 

jokes to a lukewarm response from other comics. It becomes something of a sec-
ond, very dysfunctional home to me.

February 2015
After a solid set at the LOL ROFL semester show, I am convinced that my 

comedic chops have developed to the level at which I can now deconstruct the 
medium with ease. I construct endless non-jokes and puns, confident that the 
audience will latch onto my esoteric genius. I don’t get any laughs for about a 
month, save for at a benefit gig in Saline that LOL ROFL did for Festifall money. 
Realizing that I’m going to bomb anyway, I write a whole set of shitty new mate-
rial in five minutes, delivered in a bad Seinfeld voice. Nobody laughs except the 
three comedians who came with me, who are in hysterics.

I have a particularly bad set at the UnClub, after which a comedian whom I 

admire (and as of this writing, has recently been on Conan O’Brien’s show) said 
“good job” to comfort me. After getting shit from other comedians for coddling 
me, he turns to me and says, “All right, go fuck yourself.”

April 2015
I go up at the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase for the first time, and don’t suck 

completely. I start doing well at the UnClub, and have a killer set at the ROFL-

comedy is what I want to do.

Summer 2015
I go to the New England Literature Program, where I can’t get people to stop laughing at every-

thing I say. I go back home to San Francisco, where I try to get into the Bay Area comedy scene, 
and fail to get people to laugh at anything I say. I do my first booked showcase in Berkeley and 
bomb, hard. I begin reconsidering the idea of medical school.

September 2015
Upon returning to Ann Arbor, I jump back into stand-up. I realize all the material I wrote over 

the summer was is shit and throw most of it out.

October 2015
I become vice president of LOL ROFL. I begin doing well at the UnClub at a more consistent 

frequency than I ever have before. I make Mark Sweetman, the UnClub’s host, guffaw for the first

Editor’s note: The names of some individuals 

have been changed to protect their anonymity, 
denoted with an asterisk.

“Rain is no respecter of persons
the snow doesn’t give a soft white
damn Whom it touches.”
- e.e. Cummings

Mary*, who for soon-to-be obvious reasons 

asked that I not use her real name, sits cross-
legged on a sheet of cardboard in between two 
large brick buildings in downtown Ann Arbor. 
Her face is sandpapery from the wind, with a 
burgundy smear beneath each eye. She says each 
breath feels like Altoids chased with ice water. 
She’s swaddled in many layers of coats and 
blankets. In one hand she holds a plastic coffee 
cup half-empty with bills. In the other, a sign 
that reads, in block letters, “PREGNANT AND 
HOMELESS.”

“I left my home, my family and my teaching 

job,” she tells me. “My husband is very abusive.”

Mary took a bus to Ann Arbor a few months 

ago from another Michigan city, she says, after a 
particularly brutal episode left her with broken 
facial bones and a broken sense of safety. She’s 
lived on the streets ever since.

“I spent three days in the hospital. He beat 

the hell out of me — he’s been doing it for six 
and half years, but this time it was really bad. He 
spent one night in jail, because he’s a cop,” she 
says. “It’s pathetic that I’m safer out here in the 
middle of the Michigan winter than back with 
him.”

Food isn’t an issue — her sign seems to 

inspire generosity in passersby, who bring her 
sandwiches and cups of soup. Most nights, she 
can panhandle enough to get a cheap motel room, 
or crash, for a small fee, with an acquaintance. 
But one or two nights a week, she and a few of 
her friends crawl into sleeping bags and huddle 
together behind a church. She’s on the waitlist at 
a battered women’s shelter, because she doesn’t 

want to sleep in the same shelter as “strange” 
men.

“I won’t have a baby on the streets, so 

hopefully I can figure things out,” she says.

Pending some atmospheric disaster, Ann 

Arbor will always be cold in the winter. Some 
winters are so brutal that, such in 2014, the 
University cancels classes. Others, like the 
current one, are like autumns with a dusting 
of snow. But at night, when the thermometers 
plummet, when fingers begin to resemble frozen 
shrimp, and when the wind slaps you across the 
face, the cold transitions from uncomfortable to 
unsafe.

Pending some societal miracle, Ann Arbor 

will always have a homeless population. The 
more visible individuals, the ones panhandling 
or selling newspapers on downtown streets, 
often go unnoticed as fire hydrants. Others 
you’ll never see. Suffice to say, being homeless 
is never easy. But in the winter, the struggles 
are intensified. There’s the struggle to stay 
warm, of course. But there’s also the struggle 
of local resources to provide for individuals 
in need, the struggle of individuals to balance 
self-sufficiency and self-preservation, and their 
combined struggle against social and economic 
forces that can feel as cold and oblivious as the 
air outside.

If you’re going to discuss homelessness in Ann 

Arbor, you have to begin with the Delonis Center, 
a local homeless shelter. An official-looking 
building, it stands on the corner of Huron and 
South Ashley right across the street from LIVE 
nightclub. I met with Ellen Schulmeister, the 
executive director of the Delonis Center, to get 
a better sense of the problems of the homeless 
in the winter. She began by correcting my 
terminology.

“It’s ‘being homeless in the winter,’ not ‘the 

problems of the homeless in the winter,’ ” she 
explained. “It’s an experience in your life. It’s 
not who you are.”

The distinction between the two terms 

reveals the contrasting ways in which we talk 
about homelessness. In his book “Making Room: 
The Economics of Homelessness,” economist 
Brendan O’Flaherty describes the evolution 
of American discourse on homelessness. In 
Britain, he notes, “homeless” has historically 
been a residency classification — for whatever 
period one is without a home, one is homeless. In 
the United States, on the other hand, “homeless” 
typically describes a certain scruffy lifestyle — 
panhandling, transience, reliance on charity 
— regardless of residency. The United States 
government switched to a British definition in 
1984, but, as O’Flaherty notes, “most Americans 
feel comfortable about labeling someone 
homeless without having to know where they 
slept last night.”

In 2014, the number of individuals classified 

as “literally homeless” — sleeping in the streets 
or in shelters — was estimated to be 49,895, 
according to Michigan’s Campaign to End 
Homelessness. The total number of individuals, 
which included “those living with friends 
or family due to a housing crisis and (who) 
are facing immediate eviction with no other 
resources,” was estimated at 97,642. Racial 
discrepancies are stark — African Americans 
make up 14 percent of the total population of 
Michigan, but are 52 percent of the homeless 
population.

Delonis is the largest shelter in Washtenaw 

County, and sees the most individuals — 1,459 
according to their latest annual report. It’s a 
shelter with services, providing medical and 
economic support and stable residency, as 
opposed to a mission-style shelter, which offers 
night-to-night rooms. It only services single 
adults — two other local shelters, Alpha House 
and Ozone House serve families and children 
respectively. Delonis has room for 75 residents, 
but during the winter it operates as a warming 
center for those without a place to sleep at night.

“In the summertime, being homeless is 

difficult at best,” Schulmeister said. “In the 

wintertime, it’s life-threatening.” 

To get a better idea of the dangers of winter 

homelessness, I spoke on the phone with Dr. 
James O’Connell, president of Boston Health 
Care for the Homeless Program, who’s been 
caring for people experiencing homelessness in 
Boston since 1985. To my surprise, he said it’s the 
comparatively mild weather that can prove the 
deadliest, because individuals assume that they 
can tough it out.

“When the temperature starts dropping at 

night early in the winter, people are particularly 
vulnerable, because it’s still cold enough to get 
severely hypothermic and frostbitten,” he said.

In fact, the worst case of hypothermia Dr. 

O’Connell ever saw was on an October night 
in Boston when the temperature was about 30 
degrees. The patient was found with a core body 
temperature of 72 degrees, and had to be put on 
cardiopulmonary bypass. The threshold body 
temperature for hypothermia is 95 degrees.

Most states have “danger to self” laws, which 

allow the police to take someone to the hospital 
if they believe that person poses an imminent 
threat to their safety. Michigan’s law decrees 
that “If a peace officer observes an individual 
conducting himself or herself in a manner 
that causes the peace officer to reasonably 
believe that the individual is a person requiring 
treatment … the peace officer may take the 
individual into protective custody and transport 
the individual … for examination … or for mental 
health intervention services.”

These laws operate in an ethical gray area, 

where the police are forced to balance the 
civilian’s right to autonomy and the state interest 
in preserving life, particularly when individuals 
are sleeping outside in freezing weather. Dr. 
O’Connell had mixed feelings about these laws.

“The bar is often set so high that we often err 

on respecting someone’s autonomy and possibly 
allowing them to die,” he said.

The imminent threats of hypothermia and 

frostbite — which can be exacerbated by the 

Down and Out in Ann Arbor
An investigation into homelessness in winter

numbing effects of drugs and alcohol — are 
coupled with the long-term effects of exposure. 
Weakened immune systems are susceptible to 
flus and pneumonia, which are more common 
in the winter, and easy to catch if sleeping in a 
crowded shelter. According to Dr. O’Connell, the 
leading cause of death among those living and 
sleeping on the street is not hypothermia but 
cancer, followed by heart and lung disease, all 
brought on by harsh lifestyle and deadly without 
stable medical care. As for being pregnant while 
living on the street, Dr. O’Connell said it was 
“dangerous and to be avoided at all costs, during 
any season.”

Clearly, medical problems are an effect of 

homelessness. But the causes of homelessness 
are, contrary to popular belief, primarily 
economic. To be sure, Delonis sees many clients 
with debilitating physical and mental illnesses, 
addictions and unsafe familial environments. 
But at the risk of sounding obvious, the main 
problem when experiencing homelessness is 
that you don’t have a home, and the main reason 
people don’t have a home is that they can’t afford 
one.

Homelessness has not always been a position 

of economic despair. Peter H. Rossi, in his 
book “Down and Out in America,” explains 
the shifts in the economics of homelessness in 
America. In between the Civil War and World 
War II, the homeless were primarily migrant 
laborers who moved from city to city seeking 
seasonal, unskilled labor. Theses laborers 
were so prevalent that by the late 19th century, 
most major cities had a Skid Row, a specialized 
neighborhood that provided cheap housing and 
amenities for the workers. Permanent residents 
had little affection for the migrants — Skid Rows 
were also designed to keep them out of sight, 
and “transient workers were characterized 
as tramps, hoboes and bums and were often 
warned to leave town when there was no 
demand for their labor,” Rossi writes. But they 
were still a major labor force.

By the 1940s, technological advancements 

in industry, agriculture and construction had 
eliminated the need for massive amounts 
of cheap, temporary labor. The homeless 
population became less of a workforce and more 
of what Karl Marx called a lumpenproletariat — 
an unorganized, unemployable class that exists 
on the fringes of society.

In the absence of temporary paid labor, 

many individuals experiencing homelessness 
are stuck in a vicious cycle. Without a steady 
income, you can lose your residence, and with 
a bad line of credit it’s difficult to find a new 
dwelling. Without a permanent residence, it’s 
difficult to find and hold a job. In light of this, 
Delonis assigns all residents a case manager, and 
together they work toward three primary goals: 
establishing a steady income, finding housing 
and saving money to pay for a security deposit 
and a first month’s rent. They estimate that 
50 percent of clients find permanent housing 
within the year. 

Ann Arbor is clearly not a place one would 

want to be without a home during the winter. 
But it’s also one of the most difficult places to 
find affordable housing in the state. In the latest 
ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, 
Employed) assessment by the United Ways 
Foundation, Washtenaw County received the 
lowest rating for housing affordability, and 58 
percent of rentable properties in Ann Arbor cost 

more than 30 percent minimum wage a month. 
The Atlantic recently named Ann Arbor the 8th 
most segregated city in the country. This gradual 
bloodletting of affordability, as MLive reported 
in 2014, is most likely due to increases in renting 
by both families and young professionals.

It’s the bittersweet irony of an affluent 

community like Ann Arbor — it simultaneously 
prices out low-income residents and has the 
resources to provide shelter and services for 
those experiencing homelessness.

So what’s it like to be without a home in 

Ann Arbor during the winter? I went to the 
Groundcover News office in the basement of 
Bethlehem United Church of Christ on South 
Fourth Avenue to find out. Groundcover is 
the homeless newspaper of Ann Arbor, which 
functions both as a community news source 
and a source of employment for individuals 
experiencing homelessness. I sat with the 
publisher, Susan Beckett, and three of the 
vendors, who candidly spoke about their past 
and present travails.

A home, especially during the winter, isn’t 

merely a place to stay warm. It offers security 
and stability. It’s a place to store and cook food, 
access the Internet, maintain a mailing address 
and have intimate relationships. There is a 
popular perception that if someone is homeless, 
they must only have the clothes on their back and 
a few coins in a Styrofoam cup. But as I learned 
during the research for this piece, the rises and 
falls of homelessness are less the bungee-jumps 
of the American imagination, and more a series 
of tedious, yet traumatizing, stumbles. Take, 
for example, the dilemma of losing one’s home 
and still having possessions that need to be 
protected.

“You just can’t part with them,” Louis, a 

somber-looking man, told me. “I keep my stuff 
with me at all times, keep my bags with me at all 
times, even when I sleep.”

Lit, a vivacious woman who is Groundcover’s 

most successful vendor, explained how she 
is forced to rent out a storage space for her 
possessions, including her bulky winter boots 
and coats. But she’s missed several payments 
and cannot retrieve her warm clothes until 
she settles her debts. The management is being 
relatively generous, she explains — with another 
storage space, she lost a whole cache of family 
photos and papers when she missed payment on 
storage and her unit was auctioned off.

“I’ve worn the same bra for a year and a half 

now. I have all these nice ones in storage with 
the right cup and padding. It’s just a fact of life — 
without the right padding, I feel like the nipple 
lady,” she said with an easy laugh.

But those storage problems don’t compare 

to a night during last years crushing winter. Lit 
was sleeping in her car when the heater broke 
and she was left with only a sleeping bag and 
the car’s thin walls for warmth. Already ill, she 
began having trouble breathing as sub-zero 
temperatures set in.

“I thought I was going to die,” she told me. “I 

thought I was going to freeze to death.”

She managed to get to the hospital, where 

they told her it was just a bad cold and prescribed 
medicine. After that, she began scrimping to pay 
for a motel at night.

The most banal aspects of everyday health 

and hygiene suddenly become difficult without a 
home, especially in the winter. Most businesses 
require that someone be a customer in order to 

use the bathroom. Even if one is near the woods, 
food stamps cannot be used to purchase toilet 
paper, not to mention tampons.

“For most of the winter, I wore incontinence 

pads,” Lit explains. Unable to go to the bathroom 
outside or at night, she would try and hold it in 
until 5:30 in the morning, when she could go to 
the YMCA to use the toilet and take a shower. 
But with membership prices at $50 a month, it 
was difficult to make the payments without an 
income. Louis can’t afford the YMCA, and he 
often washes himself in the church bathroom, 
using hand soap and the sink.

Qualifying for food stamps is no guarantee 

though. Able-bodied adults must work or be in a 
work program at least 20 hours a week to receive 
SNAP 
(Supplemental 
Nutrition 
Assistance 

Program) benefits, but finding that much work is 
difficult for anyone without a home. Even if one 
works, a single adult’s net income can’t exceed 
$981 a month, a sum that is quickly gobbled up 
by the ancillary costs of storage, motel rooms, 
gas and car insurance.

“I just wish the government would recognize 

that there are expenses associated with being 
homeless,” Lit said.

Food is, generally speaking, less of a concern 

than housing and hygiene. Local shelters 
often serve meals, and St. Andrew’s Episcopal 
Church has a breakfast program. Lit has made 
friends with the kitchen staff of a Main Street 
restaurant, who give her leftovers. Sometimes, 
passersby will just give the vendors food. But as 
Theresa*, an elderly vendor with a honey-thick 
southern accent, explained, relying on others 
for food always has unintended consequences. 
Driving around to different shelters and 
churches for meals costs precious gas money. 
Without a fridge or cupboards, she has to eat at 
a restaurant when no free meals are available. 
And when people are nice enough to buy her 
food, she’s sometimes unable to eat it because of 
dietary restrictions.

Theresa used to work in a plastics factory, 

but she fell and eventually lost her job because 
of the resulting disability. She was rejected for 
worker’s compensation, and lost her home.

“My doctor tells me I’ve got to keep myself 

warm during the winter, especially the joints 
I injured,” she said. “Sometimes the pain is so 
horrible that I’ll just be crying.”

After stories like this, I was left wondering 

why anyone wouldn’t head to a shelter during the 
winter. When I brought it up with Schulmeister 
from the Delonis Center, she sighed, as if she’d 
heard the question before. She explained that 
it was ultimately up to individuals to seek help, 
and some of them just don’t like the idea of 
committing to any type of program.

“It’s hard, because it’s institutional, and 

many people don’t like that, but our goals are 
short-term,” she said. “We are accommodating, 
but sometimes people don’t read us as 
accommodating.”

Louis, from Groundcover, won’t go to Delonis 

out of spite — he received a trespass, or one-year 
ban, eight years ago for having a loud verbal 
altercation with his girlfriend in the doorway, 
and said he has no interest in reapplying for 
residency. The Delonis Center doesn’t comment 
on individual cases but noted anyone can request 
to have their ban lifted. He’ll go there for meals, 
but only because those are served by an outside 
organization.

Others I met were just unaware or 

misinformed about Delonis. Daniel, a tall man 
with a wiry gray beard, became homeless a 
year ago when he left his apartment after it was 
repeatedly broken into.

“I’ve been finding myself lately just crawling 

up someplace and going to sleep,” he told me one 
frigid afternoon in between puffs on a cigarette. 
His favorite place is a heating vent in a parking 
garage that is big enough for him to lay down on 
at night. Other nights, he’ll just walk around all 
night to stay warm. When I asked him why he 
wouldn’t go to Delonis, he shrugged and said, 
“I’ve heard it’s crowded there.”

It’s understandable why some individuals 

are resistant to seeking help. Many have been 
betrayed by people they trusted: landlords, 
bosses, lawyers, family members. And for some, 
the supposed shame of accepting help outweighs 
the very real risks of the cold.

fear and self-loathing in santiago: 
an introduction

by Adam DePollo

By way of an introduction to this column, 

I’d like to say a few things about myself and 
my idea for the series that I hope might help 
you decide whether this piece is the one that 
finally proves you can no longer justify reading 
another word printed in The Michigan Daily, 
even for the low, low price of $Free.99.1

My name is Adam DePollo, and I’ve held 

several editorial and columnist positions dur-
ing my time at the Daily2 while writing on a 
wide range of topics3 in a healthy smattering of 
sections. But despite all of that work, my many 
character tics and neuroses, the critical stanc-
es I’ve tried to take in my writing, my relation-
ships with friends and family and the many 
hobbies I’ve been frantically cultivating over 
the years have yet to coagulate into anything 
I would feel comfortable calling a stable self-
concept. Or, in other words, I’m still eluded by 
the intangible somethingness toward which 
all of my efforts to date have vainly aspired: 
namely, Objective Knowledge of the Self and a 
concise answer to the Question of Questions, 
“What is the Meaning of Life?”

Fortunately,4 however, I’ve been afforded 

a rare opportunity this semester to leave my 
home, friends and family back in the callous 
Michigan tundra and spend the better part of 
six months in Santiago, Chile, exploring life 
on the planet’s much-discussed other hemi-
sphere.5 There, I will embark on one of the 

perennial undergraduate quests that our Uni-
versity6 describes as a “study abroad program,” 
but which I have already subconsciously desig-
nated “The Search for Self and Brief Glimpses 
of Universal Truth 2k16: Santiago Edition.” 
This column will, I hope, serve as an amusing, 
inspiring and at times heart-wrenching record 
of the Search, and, if we’re lucky, I might even 
come across a few instances of what the Wiki-
pedia article on novelist David Foster Wallace7 
describes as “earnest, unselfconscious experi-
ence and communication in a media-saturated 
society” — the lack of which might, for all I 
know,8 be what’s preventing me from figur-
ing it all out, landing my book deal and spend-
ing the rest of my life bumming around a villa 
somewhere as a much less confrontational 
version of David Duchovny’s character from 
“Californication.”9

Now, in feeling compelled to write this, I 

also assume that you (The Reader) want to 
read about how a guy like me goes about “find-
ing himself,” which I think means that, like 
me, you haven’t got it all figured out yet, either. 
But, let’s not fool ourselves, that’s kind of a 
weird way to go about figuring yourself out, 
don’t you think? Why not just go out and be 
yourself instead of reading about how some-
one else does it? What are we really getting out 
of stories like these? Why, as a culture, do we 
feel compelled to subject ourselves to this sort 

of syndicated navel-gazing?

I can only imagine there’s a very complex 

and multi-faceted reason for it, but, for my 
part, I’ll say that my fascination with stories 
about self-discovery stems from a combina-
tion of the fact that I’m a big fan of avant-garde 
story-writing (shouts outDaniil Kharms) and 
that stories of the self-discovery variety are 
one of the few underground literary genres 
still widely produced, even among non-liter-
ary-inclined people. Everyone has one10 and 
we come up with them, more often than not, in 
the privacy11 of our own heads, our skulls pro-
viding a calcium-rich cushion between these 
stories and the creativity-squashing influence 
of logic and fact-checking.

Because these stories are very rarely shared 

in any sort of public setting, strange things 
happen when people are asked to recount 
them out loud. Just ask any stranger in your 
nearest coffee shop how they “found them-
selves” (I have tried this) and the answer you’ll 
get12 will likely be a sprawling collection of 

sporadic anecdotes that sounds something like 
an absurdist combination of a presidential can-
didate-style stump speech and an emotional 
J.D. monologue from “Scrubs.”13 It’s somewhat 
off-putting at first, but that really is, I think, a 
pretty close approximation of what those sto-
ries we tell ourselves sound like when they’re 
bumping around in our brains.

The funny thing, of course, is that formally 

scatterbrained self-discovery stories of that 
sort work perfectly well to get you through 
the day and effectively do allow, who knows, 
maybe millions or even billions of people to get 
through their days without collapsing into a 
puddle of wrecked nerves. That fact alone — in 
my eyes, at least — pretty definitively demon-
strates that:

a. Any time you read a coherent “self-discov-

ery” narrative on a news site like this, you’re 
dealing with a literary construction, i.e. a fic-
tion, i.e. not objective reportage of any kind of 
“self” that exists in any tangible way.

and

1. The idea being that there is (in theory) some aspect of my character which would, despite 

the many differences that I’m sure exist between us, allow for the development of some kind 
of pathos or sense of kindred spirit between myself and you [the Reader], without whom this 
column would be little more than a sort of frantic travelogue written by an über-self-absorbed 
college senior who should probably be in therapy.a

1a. In practice it will be that, but with enough of you [The Readership, that is] racking up the 

page count, we might dare to call this column a Small Slice of the Millennial Experience, which 
is, as I’m sure you’re aware, another name for First Rate Journalism.

2. All of them (3+2 unofficial spots) in our Arts section, where I was given the ontologically 

distressing nickname “Father Arts.”

3. Including underground music in Detroit, sexism and commodity fetishism in Drake’s hit 

summer jam “Hotline Bling,” Grammy-winning jazz pianist Fred Hersch,student consumer 
behavior and its influence on local Ann Arbor businesses, the philosophical and political char-
acter of eating dinner alone, etc.

4. Fortunately for myself, I suppose — but who knows! Maybe for the rest of humanity, too.
5. I’m hoping that the answers to my many philosophical queries have been hiding down there 

in a spiritually resonant alleyway of some sort, or maybe under a vase in Chilean poet Pablo 
Neruda’s house, which I have every intention of visiting and whose restroom it is my most pro-
found wish to experience first-hand (since the toilet is, in my mind, the only real seat of genius).

6. Since journalism is a cold mistress who won’t pay for things like this and my parents are 

warm mistresses who can’t, the only reason I’m able to make this voyage is, naturally, with the 
assistance of UM President Mark Schlissel — or, rather, the University’s illustrious Financial 
Aid Department (Peace Be With It), which has, throughout my undergraduate career, had much 
greater confidence in my ability to pay back federal loans than any other entity on this earth or 
floating amid the ether of the great hereafter. I’m also assisted by our Uncle Sam in the form of an 
incredibly generous grant through the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program, 
which provides funding to allow “U.S. citizen undergraduate students of limited financial means 
to pursue academic studies or credit-bearing, career-oriented internships abroad." Such interna-
tional exchange, I’m told, “is intended to better prepare U.S. students to assume significant roles 
in an increasingly global economy and interdependent world.”

7. The first five chapters of whose magnum opus “Infinite Jest” I finished reading for the first 

time last week; and let me tell you, that is a guy who can sure write a lot of things. Wow. And 

his footnotes are really something — much more enthralling than your usual, run-of-the-mill 
marginalia. I, too, often have more thoughts than I could fit into a single sentence, but when he 
does it, it feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world with a much higher screen resolution. 
The closest thing I can compare it to is the feeling I get when I look at the Direct Optical guy for 
the first time after getting my new glasses prescriptions. All of the sudden he’s not only a Direct 
Optical Employee, but a Direct Optical Employee with a lot of pores and an oddly-shaped little 
scar next to his left ear, a deformity which I’m sure has some very interesting story behind it that 
I don’t feel we’re quite chummy enough to be able to ask about without seeming rude. Life is full 
of mysteries with the right corrective lenses.

8. He won a MacArthur Genius Grant, after all, so I’m sure his Objective Knowledge of the 

Self speaks for my human condition, too.

9. Keep on the lookout for a TV Notebook from myself re: the various problems with “Califor-

nication,” which are too numerous to count here. The most egregious, however, might be that 
the show ruins the perfectly pleasant idea of watching David Duchovny live out his days as a 
villa-based sardonic novelist/good-hearted hyper-macho literary enfant terrible by structuring 
itself around a prolonged, incredibly uncomfortable off-brand Nabokovian story arc wherein the 
forty-something writer gets his mojo back by way of sex with a 16-year-old girl who quickly 
turns into one of the show’s principal antagonists. It’s hideous. 

10. History and the arts are rife with examples of the types of horrific problems that pop up 

when we try to get around with (or just plain get around) faulty narratives about who we are 
and how we got to be where we’re at.a Much rarer are stories about people trying to get around 
with no such narrative whatsoever; can you name any off the top of your head?b There’s some 
sort of conceptual barrier there which I’m sure someone has written an essay about at one point 
or another.

10a. See: eye-gouging in “Oedipus Rex,” drunken arbitrary self-enthrallment in “The Tem-

pest,” the Holocaust vis-a-vis German post-WWI economic/legal sovereignty/national identity 
crises, death aboard a glacier in Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” drunken hotel room stupors 
in Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, drunken run-ins with nationalistic police officers in 
“Ulysses,” the murder of a perfectly innocent dog in “The Babadook,” etc.

10b. The closest thing I can imagine is a story that doesn’t exist. I’m thinking a remake of the 

movie “Memento” in which the anterograde amnesia-suffering protagonist never bothered to 
give himself any tattoos and simply doesn’t give a shit about the fact that he wakes up devoid of

b. Whatever literary-caliber stylistics or 

narrative inventiveness you might find in a 
person’s “self-discovery” story says absolutely 
nothing about their intrinsic value as a human 
being (which should be equal across the board) 
and very close to nothing about their “depth,” 
since what you’re trying to crawl into there is 
a drawing of a well and not an actual well (i.e. 
whatever “depth” might be there is a sort of 
optical illusion produced by the skillful manip-
ulation of perspective).

I should clarify, however, that none of this 

critique is meant to discredit the art of the 
“self-discovery” narrative as such. What I’m 
trying to get at here is that a highly wrought 
“self-discovery” narrative is more like a Fer-
rari than you’d think. Like a Ferrari, each fine-
grain narrative is a commodity, which requires 
a not-insignificant amount of mechanical skill, 
conscious tinkering, access to raw materials, 
labor hours and, yes, capital to produce. If you 
read Daily Editorial Page Editor writer Claire 
Bryan’s recent piece “Generation PS: The 
evolution of the personal statement,” how-
ever, you’ll see that, especially in recent years, 
American universities have begun to resemble 
“self-discovery” narrative Ferrari factories in 
certain important ways. Before students even 
get into the door at a place like U of M, for 
example, they’re expected to produce a pol-
ished personal statement which, demonstrates 
their life’s value as raw material to be molded 
into the finished narrative/Ferrari. That ini-
tial requirement primes them for four under-
graduate years in which they’ll be expected to 
engage in some profound self-reflection14 with 
an eye toward gradually working that initial 
narrative into a fully functional vehicle com-

plete with doors and windows, a V-12 engine, 
hand-stitched leather seats and many other 
finely tuned, aesthetically pleasing parts. 
When you’re done, you get a wonderfully 
articulate luxury-class narrative/person that 
can get you into some very nice dinner clubs 
and attract much more positive attention from 
peers, potential employers, grad school admis-
sions offices, grant disbursement committees, 
etc.

So part of the reason why we’re so fascinat-

ed with personal statements, “self-discovery” 
narratives and other sorts of creative non-
fiction, I think, is that they canhelp you get 
into very nice dinner clubs (i.e. allow you to 
hang with the upper crust, the 1 percent, the 
aristocracy or what have you). They’re the sort 
of thing we assume that a person picks up at 
university, so they suggest that the person 
writing/reciting them has a certain degree of 
learning, sophistication and respectability15 
that the uneducated masses don’t.

But, of course, the problem with using a 

narrative/Ferrari to get into a fancy dinner 
club is that the Ferrari doesn’t make the got-
damn dinner club more inclusive! All they do 
is get you in the door, and once you’re in, your 
friends who never made it through the per-
sonal statement draft round are stuck outside 
in their 2002 Toyota Camrys, leaving you with 
nothing but your “self-discovery” to get you 
through a lifetime’s worth of gilded cocktail 
hours.

So is our obsession with “self-discovery” 

narratives really a productive obsession? Does 
it do anything to improve the world we live in?

At the very least, I don’t think it’s all bad. 

Indeed, it might even be good in a sort of 

1776-vintage liberal sense. Cultivating self-
awareness and self-reflection should, in theo-
ry, also require you to question your place in 
the world around you. Questioning your place 
in the world around you, of course, requires 
that you not be the same thing as the world 
around you, which is to say that your “self” is 
something distinct from the various socioeco-
nomic systems and communities within which 
you are otherwise hopelessly embedded. 
Having “found yourself”16 in this way, you’re 
immediately provided with a platform — your 
“self,” which has its own subjective experience 
of communal life and likes to demand things 
like “personal freedom” — from which to cri-
tique the terms under which you’re expected 
to participate in society. This is why things like 
labor unions don’t exist without first having 
people who view themselves as “labor,” why 
you can’t have gay rights without first having 
“gay people,” why you can’t have rap music 
without first having a “rapper” who makes it, 
etc.

But maybe — and this is the troubling part — 

there’s a point at which “self-discovery” ceases 
to have any kind of redemptive feature, where 
the “self” no longer functions as a platform 
from which to effect change in a society, where 
“self-expression” ceases to be counter-culture 
and instead becomes a practice that reinforces 
the status quo. When I watched the earlier 
rounds of the presidential debates this election 
cycle, for example, I was a little disconcerted 
by the amount of time even establishment can-
didates like Hillary Clinton and John Kasich 
spent talking about their life stories. Not too 
long ago, that sort of thing was reserved for 
memoirs and posthumous biographies; the 

Powers that Be were expected to be more-or-
less empty suits and the art of governing was 
less art and more science. There were obvi-
ously problems with the old cold-blooded 
model (see: Henry Kissinger, Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, Cold War-era spats/proxy wars 
over “spheres of influence,” the partitioning 
of Africa in the 19th century, etc.) but, I don’t 
know, somehow I’m bothered by the idea of an 
election going one way or another based on a 
candidate’s ability to craft an entertaining nar-
rative. I also got a C- in the only PoliSci class 
I’ve ever taken, so maybe these are waters I 
shouldn’t be swimming in.

In any case, my deadline is fast approaching 

and this introduction has gone way beyond the 
sort of word count that makes my editors want 
to quit their jobs and join the Peace Corps. The 
last few thousand words have been about some 
of the problems I see with the idea of “find-
ing oneself” and putting that fictional process 
into writing, but I’ll shut up and conclude this 
discussion with a quote from Virginia Woolf’s 
essay “A Room of One’s Own.” The quote, 
I think, pretty accurately (and succinctly) 
describes the merits of an admittedly fictional 
“self-discovery” narrative and I’d like to try to 
let it justify my decision to write a narrative of 
this sort. Anywho, here it is:

"At any rate, when a subject is highly contro-

versial … one cannot hope to tell the truth. One 
can only show how one came to hold whatever 
opinion one does hold. One can only give one’s 
audience the chance of drawing their own con-
clusions as they observe the limitations, the 
prejudices, the idiosyncrasies of the speaker. 
Fiction here is likely to contain more truth 
than fact."

a self-concept every day. Instead of catching his wife’s murderer he lays in bed for an hour and 
forty-five minutes before the screen fades to black.

11. Now, the question of precisely how private it is in our own heads is, naturally, up for debate. 

Certain branches of contemporary philosophya are especially concerned with this topic, the 
general consensus being that you never can get entirely out of the Matrix. A good introductory 
example of this contemporary philosophizing (featuring plenty of entertaining pop culture ref-
erences) is Slovenian Marxist philosopher/top-notch storyteller Slavoj Žižek’s “The Pervert’s 
Guide to Ideology” (a film available on Netflix).

11a. Most of them descendants of or in conversation with psychoanalytic theory, which, in 

turn, owes quite a bit to Marxist theory — especially Marx’s comments re: commodity fetishism 
(!) which have already received a much more in-depth treatment in my “Hotline Bling” column.

12. You will need to keep prodding them with (sincere) smiles and (sincere) supportive excla-

mations, hmms and hums whenever they hit dead ends. Perhaps the occasional gentle reminder 
of why you wanted to hear this story in the first place (sincere yet disinterested curiosity re: your 
fellow man’s thoughts and feelings). This technique is often called “listening.”

13. There is a high degree of formal similarity between this sort of response and the sort of 

response you might hear in undergraduate English classrooms when the professor demands that 
an obviously clueless student give a plot synopsis of the book they haven’t read.

14. Which, if we’re being honest, is a sort of University-sanctioned self-absorption.
15. A brief alternative history of the collegiate narrative factory:
We should remind ourselves, of course, that the undergraduate period (roughly around age 

18 to 22) has been, since the middle of the last century, more-or-less universally designated by 
successive generations of undergraduates (often with the complicity of their ex-undergraduate 
parents and our pop culture’s borderline-fanatical obsession with 18-to 22-year-olds’ search 
for meaning) as the time in which American youth must “find themselves,” i.e. spend a few 
years out of the house, beyond the reach of their immediate family and most of the professional 
and behavioral expectations placed on full-fledged adults in their economic class and cultural 
milieu, trying on various personality hats, drinking to excess, experimenting with a palette of 
hallucinogenic drugs, sampling from a number of atypical sexual and romantic permutations, 
otherwise engaging in a prolonged, noble rail against the various aspects of the System which 
have always kept them down, and thanking God all the while for college, which finally shook 
them free from their cultural programming, dragged them kicking and screaming out of the 

sheeple herd and molded them into a species of satyric goat-person, carrying between their clo-
ven fingers a Certificate of Completion indicating that their four years of personhood-forging/
debauchery have fully prepared them for their choice between a. drifting along the horizonless 
sea of global capital or b. signing on for the graduate round of university life, in which they will 
trade in a sizable share of their debauchery credits for access to esoteric learnings of the highest 
caliber.

16. “Finding oneself” being, again, a sort of exercise in creative writing. “I” don’t exist in my 

own head unless I take the time out of my day to writea that character into existence.

16a. Or choose from one of the many fine selections of “I” lining the shelves of the post-post-

modern Wal-Mart we like to call the 21st century. Current American options include, but are 
not limited to, the Donald Trump Model,i the Bernie Sanders Modelii and, of course, the Under-
graduate Model, which I believe I was starting to sketch somewhere back three or four levels of 
footnote ago.iii

16ai“I” is a natural-born millionaire (despite any appearance to the contrary) whose attain-

ment of incomparable wealth and the state of pure individualism is constantly threatened by the 
combined forces of the encroaching hordes of unemployed brown-skinned barbarians and their 
crypto-communist “American” P.C. liberal allies. Comes complete with blonde toupee, Ameri-
can flag pin and one complimentary spray-tan session.

16aii “I” is a person free from the sort of jingoistic, nationalistic, individualistic and capitalistic 

fantasies that have caused so much harm and destruction over the centuries. “I” realizes that, at 
the end of the day, we’d be so much better off if we all understood that we’re in this boat togeth-
er. “I” also knows that if there are bad guys, they wear suits and ties and think money’s more 
important than building a society where their fellow man can live a healthy, happy, sustainable 
life. The suits might also be lizard men and, yes, of course “I” has watched every season of “The 
X-Files” (except the second half of season five, which was far too campy) and can quote lengthy 
snatches of “Twin Peaks” dialogue from memory. David Lynch is an unparalleled genius, after 
all. But “I” doesn’t want to talk about “Dune.” And, yes, if we’re being completely honest “I” fell 
asleep in the middle of “Eraserhead” and has not seen “The Elephant Man.” Comes complete 
with one complimentary folk guitar lesson and a guest spot on “SNL,” which “I” will accept 
despite thinking “SNL” is only barely watchable even with the best host imaginable.

16aiii I think it was before the footnotes, actually. David Foster Wallace must have been a 

really clear-headed sort of dude.

Snow melts from the blossoms of a bush in the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University.

By EMILIE FARRUGIA

A man and his dog stroll through the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University.

The sun sets onto the snow covered roof of a church near Massachusetts Avenue.

Young families sled down fresh snow at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University.

I spent this past weekend exploring the snowy streets 
of downtown Boston after a winter storm blanketed 
coastal New England Thursday night.
