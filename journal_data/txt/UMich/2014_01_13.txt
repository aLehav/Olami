Nuclear Regulatory
Commission fines for
multiple incidents
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
OnlineEditor
The United States Nuclear Reg-
ulatory Commission announced
Friday a proposed $3,500 fine
against the University's Radiation
Safety Service for "security-relat-
ed violations" discovered during a
routine inspection.
The security violation occurred
on the Ann Arbor campus and
the University "took immediate
corrective actions" after it was
informed of the violation.
The NRC found two safety
violations and one security viola-
tion during its June 2013 inspec-
tion and subsequent interviews,
according to the inspection report
sent to the University and obtained
by The Michigan Daily. All of the
violations are classified as Sever-
ity Level IV, the lowest level viola-
tion for those that are "more than
minor concern."
In the inspection report
released to the public, information
about the violation that resulted in
the fine was withheld for security
reasons.

One of the safety violations con-
cerned a 2012 incident in which
cadmium-109 was used on two
human research subjects without
the proper licensing. The report
said while the University took
"corrective action" at the time, not
enough was done subsequently to
"prevent recurrence."
The other safety violation said
the University did not properly
notify the NRC after it stopped
using its license at the Murchie
Science Building on the Flint cam-
pus. The report said this violation
occurred because of a "misinter-
pretation" of the statute.
The RSS is part of the Univer-
sity's Occupational Safety and
Environmental Health office and
is chargedwith providingtraining,
guidance and technical support
regarding radiological material
at the University, according to its
website.
The University was sent the
inspection report on Oct. 4 and
appears to have responded on Nov.
8.
According to a "conversation
record" made by the NRC, Dennis
Palmieri, a senior OSEH represen-
tative, told the NRC that the Uni-
versity "does not dispute any of the
violations referenced in the subject
letter," referring to the Univer-
sity's response sent in November.

University receives
$1 million grant to
examine the disease
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Brehm
Center and Juvenile Diabe-
tes Research Foundation have
partnered to investigate a new
hypothesis about the origins of

Type 1 diabetes.
Scientists have long sup-
ported the idea that in Type 1
diabetes, the body loses its abil-
ity to produce insulin due to
the death of beta cells, which
are insulin-producing cells in
the pancreas. Recently, how-
ever, researchers at the Brehm
Center found evidence that
beta cells may not be dying, but
instead regressing to an imma-
ture state and losing the ability
to produce insulin.

JDRF, the top Type 1 diabe-
tes fundraising organization
worldwide, granted the center
roughly $1 million to explore
the hypothesis. Andrew Rake-
man, director for JDRF's Cure
Therapies division, said the col-
laboration intends to confirm
the process is occurring and, if
it is, to look for ways to disrupt
and reverse beta cell regres-
sion.
"The first steps will be to
really show through animal

models, mouse models with
Type 1 diabetes, as well as with
samples from humans with
Type 1 diabetes whether or
not this process is occurring,"
Rakeman said. "Second, we'll
be beginning to look at what are
the mechanisms that cause the
beta cells to lose function, and
could we think about drugs or
therapies that would disrupt
that mechanism."

Omar Barghouti speaks on why the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement asks the world to boycott Israel
until it ends its mistreatment of Palestinians on Friday at Hutchins Hall.
Palestinian activist urges
'U' to divest fro-m Israel

Barghouti's talk

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
With a focus on universal
human rights and activism,
Omar Barghouti - a key mem-

ber of the Boycotts, Divest-
ment and Sanctions campaign
against Israel - received a
standing ovation from those in
attendance at his guest lecture
in Hutchins Hall Friday night.
"The very basis of BDS is
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, and in that,
a very basic concept that has
been forgotten to an extent:
that all human beings are born

free and equal in dignity and
rights," Barghouti said.
Barghouti, a Palestinian
activist and commentator,
explained BDS's mission by
focusing on what he said were
oppressive Israeli policies,
including a lack of access to
education for many Palestin-

Tribes gather at 'U' for pow wow
Forty years ago this week Thirty years ago this week Twenty years ago this week
(January 13, 1974) (January 14,1984) (January 14, 1994)

DANCE

Native Americans from 24
tribes gathered in the Michigan
League ballroom for a pow wow
sponsored by the University's
Native American Student Orga-
nization.
More than 200 Native
Americans from cities and res-
ervations across the country
attended the pow wow.
Teddy Deverney, Native
American from the Ottawa tribe
and student at the time, sup-
ported the pow wow because he
said many people "think Indi-
ans are a defeated race."

Two students were sexually
assaulted, one off campus and
one in South Quad Residence
Hall.
The assaults, assumed to
be unrelated, occurred at
about midnight. An 18-year-
old woman was raped in the
driveway of a residence at the
intersection of Washtenaw and
South University avenues. She
was walking home when a man
grabbed her from behind and
attacked her. ,
The other student was in a
South Quad bathroom when a
20-year-old male, whom she
knew, sexually assaulted her.

The University's Black Student
Union boycotted events for the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Sym-
posium because they thought the
University failed to "honor the
history of activism out of which
the symposium was created."
BSU said the theme of the
activities, "'American Culture' or
'America-the Multicultural'?"
was not relevant to the Black
community King represented.
"This holiday is not just a Black
celebration. It was not intended
that way," Jack Matlock, Director
of Academic and Multicultural
Initiatives, said.

Syrian National
Council agreed to
uphold a cease-fire
PARIS (AP) - Syria's West-
ern-backed opposition came
under steely pressure Sunday to
attend peace talks in just over a
week as envoys from 11 countries
converged to help restore, and
test, credibility of a rebel coali-
tion sapped by vicious infighting
and indecision.
But diplomacy's limits were
starkly apparent in Syria itself,
where activists said rebel-on-
rebel clashes have killed nearly
700 people in the deadliest bout
of infighting since the civil war
began.
The bloodshed, pitting al-
Qaida-linked militants against
several Islamist and more mod-
erate rebel brigades, has begun
to overshadow the broader war
against the government.
Sunday's meetings in Paris
came just over a week before the
scheduled talks in Switzerland,
as the Syrian National Coali-
tion nears collapse, its influence
eroded by the chronic infight-
ing, international pressure and
disagreement over whether to
negotiate with Syria's president,
Bashar Assad.
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry joined 10 other foreign
ministers who urged coalition
President Ahmed al-Jarba to
deliver his group to the Switzer-
land talks and finally meet face-
to-face with the government it
hopes to overthrow. Kerry said
he was confident the coalition
would be at the talks, and hinted
at a diplomatic backlash from its
allies if it skips the meetings.
"I think they understand the
stakes," Kerry told reporters
Sunday. "But I'm not going to get
into consequences other than to
say it's a test of the credibility
of everybody, and it's why I am
confident that they will be there.
Because I think they understand
that."

Al-Jarba, who will meet again
with Kerry on Monday, tried to
put the best face on his coali-
tion's precarious position. The
Syrian National Council will
vote Friday on whether to attend
the peace talks but already has
agreed to uphold a cease-fire
once negotiations begin.
"We have made clear the
reality of the situation on the
ground," al-Jarba said. "We have
addressed issues, preoccupa-
tions and worries that we know
exist."
Sunday's gathering clearly
aimed to boost the coalition, in
part with a 14-point declaration
of goals to allow the Syrian peo-
ple "to control its own future"
and "put an end to the current
despotic regime through a genu-
ine political transition."
Within Syria, the moderate
rebels say the coalition-in-exile
is little help as they find them-
selves battling on two fronts
- against al-Qaida-linked mili-
tants on one side and Assad's
forces on another. One brigade
after another has broken with
the group, calling it out of touch
with the harsh reality of a war
that activists say has killed more
than 130,000 people.
Assad himself has said there
will be no discussion of giving
up power, throwing the entire
premise of the peace talks into
doubt. On the other side, the
rebel groups with the most men,
arms and territory have already
rejected any idea of an armistice.
Sunday's declaration released by
the 11 envoys included an explic-
it request for the Syrian National
Coalition to accept the invitation
to the peace talks.
"As the weaker party, they
could agree to things that are
not in our interests. And most
of them are exiles, or have been
outside the country for such a
long time now that they don't
even feel the suffering of their
people," said Abu al-Hassan
Marea, an activist from Syria's
northern city of Aleppo, which
has seen near-daily combat for

months as rebels and the govern-
ment fight for control. "If they
agree to things that we don't
approve of, it will be betrayal of
the revolution."
The indecision and weakness
of the Syrian coalition also has
tested the patience of its back-
ers, including the U.S.
Washington had to suspend
shipments of nonlethal aid to
moderate rebel fighters last
month after insurgent groups
broke into a warehouse where it
was stored, raising the specter
that the U.S. supplies and equip-
ment would fall into extremists'
hands. Kerry on Sunday said the
Obama administration is con-
sidering when it can restart the
aid shipments and indicated that
moderate rebels may now be able
to better secure them.
He also cited an unidentified
"extremist group on the run"
that he said is losing strength
among the rebel factions.
But overall, the Syrian moder-
ate opposition would lose moral
authority if it refuses to engage
in negotiations - especially con-
sidering Assad's regime has long
signaled it plans to attend the
peace talks.
French Foreign Minister Lau-
rent Fabius said the talks were
the only hope for a political solu-
tion in Syria, "the only prospect
that can lead to a true solution."
German Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier made
clear that the series of meet-
ings, which include talks with
the Russian leadership, would
include pressure for the peace
conference.
"We want to do some per-
suading here and clear away the
last obstacles that might exist
- at least try to do that," Stein-
meier said.
Turkish Foreign Minister
Ahmet Davutoglu said the coali-
tion had, in fact, agreed last
fall to attend the meeting, but
since then has reconsidered as
the result of renewed violence
and brutality he blamed on the
regime.

show Christie's aides appeared
to engineer lane closures at the
heavily traveled bridge for polit-

Christie could move past the
scandal and still win support
from primary voters in the 2016

the iconic former prime minis-
ter and general.
A stream of visitors rang-
ing from former army com-
rades to political allies - to
citizens who only knew him
from afar remembered Sharon
as a decisive leader, for better
or for worse, and one of the final
heroes of Israel's founding gen-
eration.
"Words escape me. He was
just a man who was larger than
life," said a choked-up Shlomo
Mann, 68, who served under
Sharon's command in the 1973
Mideast war. "Those who didn't
know him from up close can't
truly understand what a legend
he was. There will never be any-
one else like him."
The 85-year-old Sharon died
Saturday eight years after a
devastating stroke left him in a
coma.
In a career that stretched
across much of Israel's 65-year
existence, his life was closely
intertwined with the country's
history. He was a leader known

for his exploits on the battle-
field, masterminding Israel's
invasion of Lebanon, building
Jewish settlements on war-
won land and then, late in life,
destroyingsome thathe deemed
no longer useful when he with-
drew from the Gaza Strip.
As one of Israel's most
famous generals, the man
known as "Arik" was renowned
forbold tactics and an occasion-
al refusal to obey orders. To his
supporters, he was a war hero;
to his critics, a war criminal.
As prime minister late in life,
he was embraced by the public
as a grandfatherly figure who
provided stability in times of
turmoil.
"Arik was, first and foremost,
a warrior and a commander,
among the Jewish people's
greatest generals in the cur-
rent era and throughout its his-
tory," Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, a fierce political
rival of Sharon, in the Likud
Party, said Sunday. "I think he
represents the generation of
Jewish warriors that arose for
our people upon the resumption
of our independence."
President Shimon Peres -
a lifelong friend and rival -
and former Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert, who succeeded
Sharon after the 2006 stroke,
were among those who paused
before the closed flag-draped
coffin displayed in a plaza in

front of the Knesset and sur-
rounded by an honor guard.
But the event was mostly an
occasion for everyday Israelis
to honor him.
With tears streaking behind
dark sunglasses, 44-year-old
Anat Amir said she felt com-
pelled to bid farewell.
"These are tears of pain and
parting but also joy in a way for
him since now he can finally
rest," she said. "He was a leader
you could count on, someone
you could trust. He looked into
the future, relied on the expe-
rience of the past and had the
courage to make tough deci-
sions and carry them out."
Norman Zysblat, 64, called
Sharon a "hero of Israel," whose
death left the 90-year-old Peres
as perhaps the last remnant
of Israel's greatest generation.
He recalled crossing the Suez
Canal in 1973 under Sharon's
command, a move widely seen
as turning a war against Egypt
and Syria in Israel's favor.
"I saw and felt firsthand the
strength he gave the soldiers.
He was the one who pushed
ahead and provided the spirit,"
Zysblat said. "He was one of
the greats. When the history of
Israel is written, he will be in
the first row."
News of Sharon dominated
Israeli newspapers. Israel's
three main television stations
all broadcast the memorial live.

Similar case upheld
in 2000 Supreme
Court decision
BOSTON (AP) - Eleanor
McCullen clutches a baby's
hat knit in pink and blue as
she patrols a yellow semicircle
painted on the sidewalk outside
a Planned Parenthood health
clinic on a frigid December
morning with snow in the fore-
cast.
The painted line marks 35
feet from the clinic's entrance
and that's where the 77-year-old
McCullen and all other abortion
protesters and supporters must
stay under a Massachusetts law
that is being challenged at the
U.S. Supreme Court as an uncon-
stitutional infringement on free
speech. Arguments are set for
Wednesday.
Outside the line, McCullen
and others are free to approach
anyone with any message they
wish. They risk arrest if they get
closer to the door.
With her pleasant demean-
or and grandmotherly mien,
McCullen has become the
new face of a decades-old fight
between abortion opponents
asserting their right to try to
change the minds of women
seeking abortions and abortion
providers claiming that patients
should be able to enter their
facilities without being impeded
or harassed.
In 2000, the Supreme Court
upheld a different buffer zone in
Colorado in a decision that some
free speech advocates, who also
support abortion rights, heavily
criticized. Noted First Amend-
ment lawyer Floyd Abrams
recently called the decision in
Hill v. Colorado "what may well
be the most indefensible First
Amendment ruling so far this
century."
The three dissenters in that
case - Justices Anthony Kenne-
dy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas - remain on the court.
They have been joined by Chief
Justice John Roberts and Justice
Samuel Alito, who may be will-
ing to provide the two additional
votes in support of the protest-
ers.
McCullen and other abortion
opponents sued over the limits
on their activities at Planned
Parenthood health centers
in Boston, Springfield and
Worcester. At the latter two
sites, the protesters say they
have little chance of reaching
patients arrivingby car because
they must stay 35 feet from the
entrance to those buildings'
parking lots.
Planned Parenthood pro-
vides health exams for women,
cancer screenings, tests for
sexually transmitted diseases,
birth control and abortions at
the clinic, although on this day
Boston clinic employees said no
abortions were performed.
McCullen doesn't know which
services arriving patients are

seeking, but she said that women
arriving with someone else usu-
ally are about to have an abortion
because they need a ride home.
Sometimes McCullen is able
to start a conversation before a
woman reaches the yellow line.
Protesters can usually be close
by when people emerge from
taxicabs.
But when a couple approached
from the opposite way, McCul-
len could only call out to them.
"There's so much help available.
Can we just talk for five min-
utes?" she said.
The man and woman showed
no reaction and entered the
clinic unimpeded.
"This is what we have to deal
with," McCullen said, on the
first of two days in mid-Decem-
ber on which she spoke with an
Associated Press reporter out-
side the Planned Parenthood
facility.
Planned Parenthood work-
ers and state officials said that
the buffer zone has reduced
significantly the harassment
of patients and clinic employ-
ees. Before the 35-foot zone
went into effect in 2007, pro-
testers could stand next to the
entrance and force patients to
squeeze by, said Marty Walz,
president and CEO of Planned
Parenthood League of Mas-
sachusetts. While in the state
House, Walz was the lead spon-
sor of the law.
Walz said safety is para-
mountforpatients and her staff.
Other than Walz, people at the
clinic refused to have their
faces photographed because
they fear anti-abortion activists
would post the pictures online.
Clinic director Cheryl Sacks
said she is granted a special
registration status for her car
to keep the information private.
The concern about safety is
not theoretical. In 1994, a gun-
man killed two receptionists and
wounded five employees and vol-
unteers at a Planned Parenthood
facility and another abortion
clinic in nearby Brookline.
The most recent killing was
in 2009, when Dr. George Til-
ler, who performed abortions,
was shot in a church in Wichita,
Kan.
"We're concerned for patient
and staff safety if the current
law is overturned," Walz said.
Mark Rienzi, the Catholic
University law professor who
represents the protesters, said
there has not been a document-
ed case of violence at a Massa-
chusetts clinic since the 1994
killings.
"The idea that someone
like that will be deterred by a
painted line on the ground is
nonsensical," he said. "In the
meantime, you shouldn't be
able to use that to stop women
from being offered these other
options. As a practical matter,
that's what happens."
Other state and federal laws
already protect health center
workers and patients, as well as
access to clinics, Rienzi said.

'Sister Wives' reality TV stars
react to cohabitation decision

Federal judge ruled
in Dec. that family
could cohabitate
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -
There was no fist-pumping or
wild celebrations by the polyga-
mous family that stars in the
TLC reality TV show "Sister
Wives" when a federal judge in
Utah struck down key parts of
the state's polygamy laws.
In an interview with The
Associated Press, Kody Brown
and his four wives said they
felt humbled and cried when
they heard in mid-December
the judge ruled in their favor in
a lawsuit they brought against
Utah in July 2011 after they fled
the state for Las Vegas under
the threat of prosecution.
"The first thing I thought
about was all those families
that for 100 years had lived and
loved in obscurity, just in secre-
cy," said Kody Brown in a phone
interview from Las Vegas. "Not
being able to claim their family
or openly love one another."
Kody and his wives - Meri,
Janelle, Christine and Robyn
- said they hope the landmark
ruling stands and enables other
polygamous families in Utah to
live open and free without fear-
ing prosecution.
"It's been incredible not hav-
ing to live in fear anymore and
being able to fully claim who
we are," said Christine Brown,
Kody's third wife. "We wish
that for every plural family out
there."
The Utah attorney general's
office has not yet decided if
they will appeal the ruling, said
spokesman Ryan Bruckman.
The state's new attorney gen-
eral, Sean Reyes, has been in

office for less than two weeks.
Jonathan Turley, the
Browns' Washington, D.C.-
based attorney, said he's been
told Utah will appeal. He said
he's eager to defend the rul-
ing before the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
U.S. District Judge Clark
Waddoups said in the decision
handed down on Dec. 13 that a
provision in Utah's bigamy law
forbidding cohabitation with
another person violated the
First Amendment, which guar-
antees the freedom of religion.
The ruling decriminalizes
polygamy, but bigamy - hold-
ing marriage licenses with
multiple partners - is still
illegal. Utah's law was consid-
ered stricter than the laws in
49 other states because of the
cohabitation clause. If the rul-
ing stands, Utah's law would be
identical to most other states
that prohibit people from hav-
ing multiple marriage licenses.
In most polygamous families in
Utah, the man is legally married
to one woman but only "spiritu-
ally married" to the others.
There are an estimated
38,000 fundamentalist Mor-
mons who practice or believe in
polygamy, most living in Utah
and other Western states.
Polygamy is a legacy of the
early teachings of the Mormon
church but has no place in mod-
ern Mormonism, church offi-
cials said in a statement. The
Salt Lake City-based Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints abandoned polygamy in
1890 and it strictly prohibits the
practice today for its 15 million
members worldwide.
Though some have correlat-
ed the Browns fight to decrimi-
nalize polygamy with efforts
to legalize gay marriage, the

Browns don't see the two as
being the same.
"Though we support the
choices of other people orga-
nizing their families however
they choose, our argument has
always been very different,"
Kody Brown said. "What we've
been looking for is simply to live
free and to be able to live our
religion without the threat of
prosecution."
The family says they never
intended to challenge Utah's
polygamy law in court when
they decided to do the show.
Janelle Brown, Kody's second
wife, said they wanted to dis-
pel the negative stereotype of
polygamous families.
"We were tired of Warren
Jeffs being the only image peo-
ple had of polygamy," she said.
One of the most infamous
polygamists, Warren Jeffs, is
serving a life sentence in Texas
for sexually assaulting two
underage girls he considered
his brides. Jeffs still rules a sect
of fundamentalist Mormons on
the Utah-Arizona border from
jail.
The Browns are now liv-
ing in four new houses in a Las
Vegas cul-de-sac. That's where
TLC films episodes of the show,
which debuted in 2010 with
footage of the family at their
house in northern Utah.
But despite an arrangement
that looks comfortable, Kody
Brown said they miss living
in the large house they called
home in Utah. In fact, they miss
Utah dearly.
They said leaving the state
has left many scars for them
and their children. They fled in
January 2011 after local pros-
ecutors opened a criminal big-
amy investigation after the first
episodes aired.

Supporting student-athletes
Closing the graduation gap requires personalized support for athletes
recent study conducted by CNN reported "many (public
university) students in the basketball and football programs
could read only up to an eighth-grade level." Although the study
doesn't include numbers from Michigan, the University's student-athletes
have exhibited a history of poor academic performance. Graduation rates
for Michigan student-athletes have traditionally been much lower than
those of the general student body. In order to facilitate the improvement
of academic performance among athletes, the University needs to provide
more attentive and personalized support to its student-athletes.

The senior shriek

CNN reached out to 40 public universities,
asking for the SAT, ACT and reading
comprehension scores for its admitted
student- athletes. On Jan. 7, 2014, CNN
published its findings on the 21 schools that
responded, and discovered that a majority
of schools had "between 7 percent and 18
percent of revenue sport athletes who are
reading at an elementary school level."
Michigan was one of the schools that failed to
provide information on its students.
In 2013, the University's Federal Gradu-
ation Rate - which measures the gradua-
tion rate of freshmen within six years - for
football players was 57 percent. The men's
basketball team showed a FGR of 50 percent.
Michigan's six-year graduation rate for all
students - athlete or not - was 89.7 percent
in 2012, good for fourth-best in the nation.
Student-athletes are pressured into
certain degrees, whether they actually find
an interest in them or not. For example,
within the Kinesiology Department, 60 slots
are saved specifically for student-athletes.
However, more often than not, athletes find
themselves unprepared for the major and
shift into general studies. In 2004, 49 percent
of students completing general studies
majors were being pursued by athletes. This

major has no foreign language requirement,
fewer graduation requirements and lacks
concentration in one subject area, making it
a vague and bland degree to pursue. Athletes
should be given the same academic attention
as any other student at the University, and be
encouraged to pursue a major they find an
interest in, not the onethey are pressured into.
Focusing on the athlete's academic desires
will allow student-athletes to achieve their
greatest potential, both on the field and in the
classroom. The University and NCAA should
also consider relaxing the time and financial
constraints put on student-athletes through
the limitations of four-year scholarships and
other restrictive rules that push students to
graduate as quickly as possible.
However, the negative trend between ath-
letes and academics isn't something the Uni-
versity, or anycollege, can solve. Mostofthese
students enter the University unequipped for
rigorous higher education, starting at the ele-
mentary school level. The mere fact that some
athletes are barelyliterate and notgraduating
shows that the education system is failing to
teach students, and is emphasizing too much
on athleticism. Without reforms to the pres-
ent education system, athletes will continue
to be left in the dust.

Georges Perec's Things: A Story
of the Sixties is a tribute to another
generation in which a hunger for
material and immaterial things
(experiences, clothes, prestige and
likes) hid the emptiness of people's
lives. Its perpetually frustrated
characters are described as being
caught in a web of their own vast
desires. As I think about my own
future, the idea of paralysis by
sheer magnitude of aspiration first
introduced to me through Perec's
work comes to mind. I want to be a
filmmaker. I want to make money.
I want to help people. I want to
move far away. I want to stay close
to home. I want everything and act
upon nothing. I envy mercilessly:
cheapening what I have by peering
over my neighbor's wall and covet-
ingtheir summer internships.
In the black silence of greed I

wallow. I take online personality
quizzes that are supposed to tell
me what careers would be a good fit
for my personal brand of incompe-
tence. Apparently I'd make a great
guidance counselor or carpenter.
Maybe I should change majors.
Iam invited to the Rhodes Schol-
ars reception. Mistakenly, I think it
is an informal information session
so I go wearing a sweat suit and
smelling like yesterday's pizza. As
the wine and cheese pageantry cli-
maxes the candidates for the vari-
ous fellowships offhandedly list
their accomplishments, I wonder
what types of time management
strategies go into winning research
awards by day and fighting crime by
night. What would these Sunday-
best baby geniuses do if I lifted my
coffee cup and poured its contents
on my head? I leave and make a
mental note to work harder to end
global warming.
They have jobs for people like me
at specialty coffee shops and white-
walled minimalist boutiques. I'll
be excellent at greeting costum-
ers with intelligent, noncommittal
banter, allowing them to peruse
their options with amused ease.
My fellow employees will love
me for my well-constructed work
time playlists and caffeine-induced
bursts of creative energy (which
will result in elaborate window
displays and behind-the-counter
tomfoolery). I might even get a new
boyfriend who plays bluesy guitar
in a band that's blowing up on the
local scene. He won't let me shoot
his music videos because he has a
friend who could do it better, but I'll

take many Vines with perfect shot
compositions. I won't have to live
in my parents' basement because
they'll let me use my old room with
its bumbling mountains of camp
photos and young adult literature.
"You're still my little girl," my mom
will say as she drops me off for
work, "Don't forget to e-mail your
resume to Dad's friend tonight."
For now I let myself love this
cocoon of a university, its Mid-
western warmth, its self-assured
machinery. Every day I walk its
campus, my flaws and strengths
become more evident; defeats scab
over with time and experience
while victories are cauterized by
reality's harsh flame. This is a place
that has made me feel incredibly
proud of myself, yet small as hell,
hellishly small, looking the wrong
way through a telescope. Michigan
is the place where I began to fathom
how much someone my own age can
accomplish. It is where I fumblingly
began to understand the concept
of self-discipline and the power of
the uncool. Maybe I will end up as
a professional coffee crafter, queen
of the pour-over brew ... but Michi-
gan keeps whispering that maybe I
will accomplish something beyond
my own vast imaginings, past Hol-
lywood and Wall Street, around the
curve of Madagascar, to the stars.
I may be graduating in the
spring. Or I may not be, For now I
dance the Mambo No. 4, the fourth
year, the senior shriek, hoping that
the future is as bright as they say.

Dynasty disaster

The GOP vs women... again

T he new year is supposed to
bring in rejuvenation. Con-
sidering that everyone is
one year older

Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the family
featured in the unusual and wildly popular
TV show "Duck Dynasty," has started a
controversy across the country. On Dec.
18, the television network A&E announced
that the anti-gay statements Robertson
made to GQ magazine were disappointing
and that he would be suspended from the
show "indefinitely." The country went wild.
Supporters of the program claim he had the
constitutional right to express his religious
and personal beliefs without being kicked
off the show, while A&E supporters said the
network had every right to suspend him. In
fact, since A&E is a private enterprise and
the "Duck Dynasty" family signed a contract
with them, the network was within its legal
rights to suspend him, despite the petitions
flying around the web to boycott them.
Legal experts have confirmed that generally
when people sign contracts with TV networks
for a new show, a "morals" clause is included
in the writing. Although the specifics of the
Robertson contract aren't known, there likely
is a morals clause in his contract as a matter of
general practice. If so, this would prohibit Phil
Robertson and other members of the show from
using any language or performing any actions
that are "insulting or denigrating." While that
seems like a broad spectrum with a lot of gray
area, these definitions are basically left up to
the network to decide. In this case, A&E has
determined that Robertson's statements do not
stand for what the television program wants to
promote. Throughout the GQ article, Robertson
compared homosexuality to bestiality and
included homosexuals in a category with
"adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes,
the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the
swindlers ..." who are all denied access into
heaven according to the Christian Bible.
Former Republican vice presidential can-
didate Sarah Palin of Alaska and Republican
Gov. Bobby Jindal, of Louisiana have both
criticized A&E for being "intolerant" of Rob-
ertson's religious beliefs, which they say are
protected under the First Amendment. The
politicians are not quite accurate in their cit-
ing of the Constitution, however, because the
First Amendment only protects citizens from
encroachment by the government. It is not

likelythat Robertson could find legal recourse
due to any constitutional rights because his
contract was signed with a private TV net-
work under guidelines that he agreed to.
Others may say that A&E is discriminating
against Robertson's religious beliefs and his
ability to express them in a free country,
but this too would be hard to prove in court.
According to Eugene Volokh, a professor at
University of California, Los Angeles Law
School, "It doesn't sound like they were taking
him off the show because they don't like the
fact that his message is religious; I think they
don't like the fact that his message is anti-
gay ... I imagine if an atheist on an A&E show
said things that A&E thought disapproved
of homosexuality, they would deal with it
the same way." In other words, Robertson
would have a hard time convincing anyone in
the legal system, a judge or a jury, that A&E
was discriminating against his religion. The
problem was that the network was upset with
his anti-gay and thus offensive comments,
which he couched in a religious pretext.
Considering that Robertson's comments
were on such a hot-button political issue, this
story has sparked controversy and garnered a
fair amount of media attention. Even though
many people are invested in his comments
and the ongoing countrywide debate about
religion and homosexuality isn't likely to be
solved for a long time, this doesn't mean that
anything illegal happened. Americans are
apt to quote the First Amendment with little
knowledge of its limitations and requirements
for application. Freedom of speech does
not mean you can say whatever you want,
whenever you want with no consequences.
In this situation, Phil Robertson signed a
contract with the private, non-government
television network A&E, and when he made
comments in violation of his contract, they
were within their legal rights to suspend
him per the contract he signed. Just because
Robertson is famous doesn't mean he can say
whatever he wants. As he is still connected
with A&E, they "own" his words and have the
ability to kick him off the show if his behavior
is contrary to their morals.

wiser, the new
year should usher
in new goals,
insights and
evolved ideas.

ideas of the past.
2013 was a

PATRICK
MAILLET

rough year for
the American government. From
the NSA leaks to the government
shutdown to the continuing debacle
that is healthcare.gov, the American
people lost a lot of faith in their
government this past year. In
particular, Americans got to see just
how polarized Congress is. In 2013,
the first year of the 113th Congress,
a total of 65 laws were passed - the
fewest of any single Congressional
session on record. The House voted
to repeal the Affordable Care Act 42
times while much-needed legislation
on immigration reform, a farm bill
and an act ensuring the creation of
jobs all floundered and were unable
to get out of committee.
Instead of approaching the new
year with optimism and potential
bipartisanship, the House is sim-
ply repeating the errors of the past
year. Last week House Majority
Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va) released
the congressional calendar for
2014. In an effort to maximize cam-
paign abilities for the upcoming
midterm election, the House will be
in session just 97 days prior to Elec-
tion Day, and 112 days altogether.
In 2013, the House was in session
118 days before Election Day and
135 days altogether. Just when we
thought the "do nothing Congress"
had done as little as they possibly
could, we discover that Congress
can somehow stoop even lower.
While the GOP is maintaining
its strict philosophy that "a

government that does nothing is a
good government," the party has
also renewed another one of its past
initiatives: its war on women.
Last Thursday, a subcommittee
of the House Judiciary Committee
held a hearing on H.R. 7, the "No
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
Act." This subcommittee, consisting
solely of 12 men, reviewed a bill that
would "deny tax subsidies to women
and small businesses who purchase
health insurance plans that include
abortion coverage." This bill
would ban insurance coverage for
abortion in all of the newly created
state-level insurance marketplaces
from the ACA while also forcing
small businesses to pay additional
taxes on health benefits for their
employees if the company's insurer
offers abortion coverage. The bill's
only exceptions are for women who
are victims of rape or incest, and
for cases in which the life of the
mother is at risk. This distinction
of whether or not an abortion fits
these exceptional circumstances
will likely be decided by the IRS,
meaning that a rape victim would
potentially need to plead her case for
an abortion to an IRS auditor.
Don't let the name of the bill
fool you. Taxpayer dollars are
already banned from going toward
abortions as reinforced by the
Stupak Amendment of the ACA. The
"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
Act" instead works to curtail
women's rights by penalizing those
who offer such types of insurance.
But the GOP's war on women's
health doesn't stop there. Rep.
Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced last
month that he plans on attaching a
rider to the appropriations pack-
age that is likely facing a vote next
week, which would allow employ-
ers to refuse offering health insur-
ance that covers contraception for
moral reasons. As Ryan said on a
talk radio interview last month, "I'm
fighting for a conscience clause rider
on appropriations because I'm very
worried about religious freedom."

Religious freedom is certainly
something worth defending, and
it is guaranteed to us in the First
Amendment of the Constitution.
But that same document establishes
the judicial branch of government
headed by the Supreme Court. The
Court has made it clear time and
again that a woman has the right to
choose what she does with her body.
Insteadofappreciatingthe lawofthe
land set forth by the Supreme Court,
the GOP continues to do everything
in its power to strip women of their
legal rights.
This battle is particularly rele-
vant here in Michigan, as this state
has now become one of the single
most restrictive states for women's
health. Last month the Republi-
can-dominated state legislature
approved a bill that bans both pub-
lic and private insurers from cover-
ing an abortion even in the cases
of rape, incest or endangerment to
the mother's life. Now a woman in
Michigan will have to purchase an
additional rider on her insurance
policy if she wishes to proactively
prepare for getting pregnant from
rape. Unfortunately, other states
are following Michigan's lead and
working to pass similar laws.
So for those of us who are
ready to fight for women's health,
get ready for another year filled
with the same old arguments
perpetuated by the same old list
of characters. Instead of focusing
on pressing issues that should be a
goal of legislative action, the GOP
has decided to continue its war on
women in the coming year in order
to rally its conservative base for
the upcoming midterm elections.
Another year will likely be wasted
on partisanship. Although I'd love
to say that 2015 might usher in an
era when middle-aged white men
stop making decisions about what
women can do with their bodies,
I'm not too optimistic.

specifically because the Unit-
ed Nations has been unable or
unwilling to help Palestinians
attain rights under the hegemony
of the U.S. government and Con-
gress," he said.
Barghouti highlighted state-
ments made by United Nations
officials that he said deemed Isra-
el, by international standards, an
apartheid state, drawing compar-
isons between Israel and apart-
heid South Africa. In his lecture,
he accused the Israeli govern-
ment of being a racist regime,
pointing to the lack of an official
Israeli national identity as evi-
dence of discrimination.
"If you recognize an Israeli
nationality, that means equality
for Arabs and Jews within Isra-
el, and that cannot be allowed,"
Barghouti said of the Israeli gov-
ernment's motives.
Students Allied for Freedom
and Equality sponsored Barghou-
ti's visit to the University. SAFE
collaborated with the Jewish
Force for Peace and the Students
for Justice in Palestine at Uni-
versity of Michigan, Dearborn to
host his lecture.
The lecture followed last
month's controversy over
#UMMockEviction, and a month
after the American Studies Asso-
ciation and Association for Asian-
American Studies endorsed an
academic boycott of Israel.
"We are trying to generate
some kind of action for the Uni-
versity to divest from companies
that profit from Israeli occupa-
tion," said LSA senior Yazan
Kherallah, a SAFE member.
However, following the ASA
endorsement of BDS, University

giving him a 22 percent approval
overall. However, several factual
inaccuracies were reported after
the scorecard's initial release.
The group dropped four bills in
question on Jan. 8, changing the
ranking to 25 percent approval.
The scorecard was released
a week before Snyder's annual
State of the State address, during
which he will outline his agenda
for the next legislative year. Mike
Berkowitz, legislative and politi-
cal director of the Sierra Club
Michigan Chapter, said the rat-
ing's timeliness should prompt
Snyder to weigh environmental
issues more seriously.
"We hope that Governor Sny-
der will see this and reflect with
his team the impact that his deci-
sions have had on the environ-
ment," Berkowitz said. "We think
that he has not been primarily
concerned with that."
Public Policy prof. Barry Rabe
said the Sierra Club's low score
may come from ideological dif-
ferences between themselves and
the governor on approaches to
environmental policy.
"On this one, the Sierra Club
has probably taken one of the
more aggressive stands of any
environmental group against
any further development of fos-
sil fuels - the use of coal, oil and
also natural gas," Rabe said. "The

President Mary Sue Coleman
and Provost Martha E. Pollack
released astatement opposingthe
academic boycott.
"At the University of Michi-
gan we are committed to global
engagement at all levels and
believe the free exchange of ideas
is essential to advancing knowl-
edge and strengthening mutual
understanding," Coleman and
Pollack wrote in their statement.
The administrators' stance
was criticized at the event Fri-
day. Asian-American Studies
Prof. Scott Kurashige, the open-
ing speaker, expressed his disap-
pointment with the University
within the first few minutes of
the program.
"I'm proud of the leaders of
AAAS and ASA," he said. "I'm not
as proud of the Michigan presi-
dent and provost, who rushed to
issue their statement denouncing
our resolutions by slavishly par-
roting the press releases others
had drafted before them."
Barghouti's speech explored
how Palestinians face difficulty
in obtaining access to education
in Israel.
Barghati's remarks were con-
tested during a question-and-
answer session later in the night.
While Barghouti has Master's
degrees from Columbia Univer-
sity and Tel-Aviv University, one
student called his stance hypo-
critical, questioning Barghouti's
involvement in the Israeli educa-
tion system he admonishes.
"Palestinians living under
oppression with Israeli IDs who
pay tax to the Israeli system of
oppression, to the apartheid
state, have no choice but to use
the services of the oppressor,"
Barghouti said.
University alum Amer Zahr
was a Palestinian activist when
he attended school in the late
Sierra Club has probably gone
farther than most other major
mainstream orgs. in making that
a signature focal point."
In contrast to the Sierra Club's
pro-conservation stance, Snyder
emphasized his belief that energy
and the environment that pro-
tecting the environment does not
mean abandoning the develop-
ment of energy resource in a Nov.
2012 address.
"We have many success-
ful companies that have safely
produced oil and natural gas
in Michigan, while protecting
Michigan's waters," Snyder said
at the time.
Snyder spokeswoman Sara
Wurfel characterized the score-
card as erroneous, adding that
in contrast to the Sierra Club's
scorecard, the governor has done
many things during his tenure to
help the environment.
"Gov. Snyder is working to
ensure a Pure Michigan for
years to come - a place that all
will want to live, work and play,"
Wurfel said.
A similar scorecard, main-
tained on an ongoing basis by the
Michigan League of Conserva-
tion Voters, ranks Snyder higher,
characterizing 72 out of a total of
124 tracked actions as positive, 24
as neutral and 32 as negative.
The one major policy refer-
enced on the scorecard that the
Sierra Club and Snyder did agree
on was the creation of a regional
transit authority, which will

'90s and early 2000s. He said he
recalls attending pro-Israel dis-
cussions at Hillel and noted that
Friday night's discussion seemed
canned. Zahr also pointed to a
change in the climate of activism
on campus.
"What I heard today was talk-
ing points to poke little holes in
the debate, rather addressing
humanitarianism as a whole,"
Zahr said.
Some felt that the Q&A creat-
ed a one-sided atmosphere. LSA
sophomore Erica Mindel, the
president of Israel - Leadership,
Advocacy, and Dialogue, said she
felt there was not much room for
conversation.
"I went to the event tonight
to listen and ask questions,"
she wrote in a statement to The
Michigan Daily after the lecture.
"I felt that the speaker's response,
but especially the audience's
reaction, shut down the opportu-
nity for discussion. As a student,
I felt our academic institution
was overtaken by closed-minded
community members."
Barghouti explained BDS's
mission prior to the Q&A, focus-
ing on addressing what he said
are oppressive Israeli policies. He
emphasized that although BDS
is an anti-Zionist movement, it
strongly opposes anti-Semitism.
History Prof. Victor Lieber-
man teaches a course on the
Arab-Israeli conflict and said the
BDS movement oversimplifies the
complicated political and socio-
logical situation within Israel.
"The occupation embodies a
reciprocal dynamic over many
years inwhichvisceralinsecurity,
provocation and a zero-sum men-
tality have captured both sides,"
Lieberman wrote in a statement.
"Without nuanced perspectives,
stable political solutions seem to
me unlikely."
bring a unified public transit net-
work to Southeast Michigan.
Public Policy prof. Elisa-
beth Gerber, one of Washtenaw
County's representatives on the
regional transit authority, said
the creation of the authority
should be seen as a major success
for the governor.
"The state legislature has
attempted 33 times to pass leg-
islation to create a RTA," Gerber
said. "This is try number 34. I
would say that his political lead-
ership was essential - it wasn't
the only factor that helped pass it
this time, but I think without him
it would not have passed."
The RTA is projected to be
a positive development for the
environmentibecause of its role in
shifting people away from travel-
ing using individual vehicles.
None of the policies on the
scorecard directly relate to stu-
dents, but Rackham student
Charlotte Jameson, who is study-
ing environmental policy and
planning, said the governor's
environmental track record
should still be seen as important.
"I think the whole argument
about this is setting the stage
for future generations and really
should resonate with people my
age and younger," Jameson said.
"It sounds kind of cliche to say
that because it's generally over-
hyped in alot of communications
and organizations, but I think it
really does matter."

LAND

University in isolation," Kosteva
said. "The city may be experi-
encing a short term loss of some
of those tax revenues, Kosteva
said, but through most of the
efforts of the University, there
has been a demonstrable long-
term gain in taxable value in the
city."
The University has created
more than 9,000 jobs since 2001,
and without the University,
property value in Ann Arbor
would likely have suffered tre-
mendous losses in 2008 and the
years that followed.
"During the recession, Uni-
versity communities were better
insulated against property value
declining," Kosteva added.
Speculation has already

begun as to how the University
will be using this property, or if
the city will purchase the prop-
erty and look for private inves-
tors and new business to buy the
land later on. Edwards Broth-
ers, Inc. - the fifth-largest book
and journal manufacturer in the
country - currently owns the
property, and the building that
stands on it will likely be demol-
ished.
"We don't have any specific
plans for the site," Kosteva said,
"With that being said, it is also
apparentthat it is in the immedi-
ate proximity of major portions
of the Ross Athletic Campus as
well as the South State com-
muter lot, so I think that there
is a reasonable assumption that
if the University were successful
in acquiring it, part of the uti-
lization of this property would
be to support the Ross Athletic

Campus."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said in December
that the property could expand
the Athletic Department facili-
ties, as it sits in a prime location
for University expansion.
"When strategic pieces of
property like this become avail-
able, it makes good sense for the
University to pursue properties
that would be in such strategic
locations," Fitzgerald said.
City Administrator Steve
Powers is in the process of
assessing the city's strategic
options for the Edwards Broth-
ers property, and the Ann Arbor
CityCouncil is expectedto make
a final decision in February. City
Council members have already
begun looking for other pro-
spective buyers, though there is
no indication what other parties
might be interested.

Berlin synagogue feud
captured in viral video

German government
has scrutinized the
community's rising
expense requests
BERLIN (AP) - Under the
golden dome of the Berlin syn-
agogue, elderly worshippers
traded shoves and obscenities
flew. A man held up his phone
to film the ruckus; the leader of
the city's Jews snatched it away.
Then punches began to land in
a chaotic scrum, a man rammed
a table into another's stomach,
and demurely clad women put
each other in chokeholds. Police
had to be called to restore calm.
The ugly scene, described
in interviews with witnesses
and seen on an Internet video,
is indicative of a Berlin Jewish
community in crisis - riven by
cultural rivalries, its finances
under official scrutiny. It's hard
to say who is at fault, but the
feuding is fed at least in part by
a clash between an old guard of
German Jews dating to before
World War II, and a growing
presence of relative newcomers
from the former Soviet Union.
What is clear is that the
10,000-member Jewish Com-
munity of Berlin, having experi-
enced a stirring post-Holocaust
rebirth, now fears it's in dan-
ger of falling apart. And Berlin
authorities are so alarmed by
alleged financial irregularities
that they have suspended mil-
lions of euros (dollars) in subsi-
dies the community has enjoyed
for decades.
"The quarrels highlight
the demoralization that has
been taking place in this com-
munity," Lala Suesskind, who
headed the Jewish Community
of Berlin until February 2012,
told The Associated Press. "The
community is in such a hopeless

situation that even violence and
intimidation are being used.
That's unprecedented."
At the center of the storm is
Gideon Joffe, who was elected
nearly two years ago as com-
munity president, and whose
leadership style has alienated
members even as he comes
under official scrutiny of his
financial management.
The brawl in the famed Neue
Synagoge on Oranienburger
St. erupted last May after the
Berlin Senate, the community's
main source of funding, made a
stunning announcement: It was
cutting off payments for the
community's salaries until Joffe
explained why his latest budget
included an 11 percent increase
in subsidies for personnel costs
- a jump of about 600,000
euros (more than $800,000).
Joffe refused to give details of
where the money would go -
or even the number of staff the
community employs.
The city responded by block-
ing the funds - and the commu-
nity was unable to pay salaries.
Joffe declined to be inter-
viewed, but his spokesman,
Ilan Kiesling, speaking to the
AP, said: "A small group from
the opposition is trying again
and again to create a bad atmo-
sphere in public, even though
the community's institutions
are working very well. The
opposition does in no way
reflect the entirety of this com-
munity."
The Senate pays about 5.5
million euros a year toward
community salaries - 40 per-
cent of the total - and can't
calculate the budget without
knowing exactly how many
employees are involved, city
officials said. Estimates provid-
ed by Joffe of between 300-350
persons on the payroll are too
vague, they said.
"We are happy to provide

money to the Jewish commu-
nity. We're eager to support its
growth, and due to our histori-
cal responsibility we're will-
ing to be generous," said city
spokesman Guenter Kolodziej.
"After the war, the rebirth of
Jewish life was worth its weight
in gold.
"However, we are obligated
to control how the money is
being spent, and we weren't
able to do so."
Joffe has sued Berlin over
the interruption of subsidies
and a decision is expected this
year. Meanwhile, a temporary
court order obliges the city to
pay what it owes under previous
agreements, but it is still refus-
ing to hand over the extra 11
percent demanded by Joffe.
The overall amount of public
money the community receives
is determined by the deal it
struck with the Berlin state par-
liament in 1994. It entails pay-
ing the community a lump sum
for employees' salaries and fur-
ther contributions for schools,
nursing homes and synagogues
- adding up to 18.5 million
euros a year.
That treaty followed the fall
of Communism in 1989, when
some 200,000 Jews from the
former Soviet Union were
allowed to settle in Germany.
Julius Schoeps, a member of
a prominent German Jewish
family, says he quit the organi-
zation because he was fed up
with Joffe's leadership. But he
added that the overall problems
were long in the making, stem-
ming from the huge sums Berlin
doled out over the years without
demanding a full accounting. "I
told Berlin lawmakers years ago
to check where the money is
going, but they always replied
they were too afraid to be
depicted as anti-Semites to con-
duct any thorough controls," he
said in an interview.


DIABETES
From Page 1A
founded in 2004 with a $44
million gift from Bill and Delo-
res Brehm, frequent Univer-
sity donors. They have also
sponsored the construction of
the Brehm pavilion at the School
of Music, Theater and Dance.
However, the center's
researchers do not work in the
same place. Instead, researchers
are joined through the Brehm
Coalition, a group of nine senior
scientists with labs at eight dif-
ferent universities across the
country.
Dorene Markel, director of the
Brehm Center, said such a coali-
tion was unprecedented in diabe-
tes research.
"The Brehms actually had this

idea of forming the Brehm Coali-
tion - sort of a dream team of
scientists who would work as if
they were all co-located, except
they wouldn't be," Markel said.
"It was formed to really have a
team of scientists who would
work together in a way that really
had not happened in diabetes
research before."
While many members of the
Brehm Coalition are already
funded independently by JDRF,
Markel said this will be the first
time JDRF has funded the coali-
tion as a whole. In response,
Markel said the coalition will
ensure that JDRF will be an
active participant in the research
process.
"We have suggested that this
be a learning exercise where
the JDRF scientific members
and the JDRF will participate,"

Markel said. "They can help drive
where the research goes, and be
an active piece of the research,
which is not something that
JDRF has been invited to do
before."
Markel added that the finding
of immature beta cells raises a
list of questions that can only be
answered by probing further into
the biology of Type 1 diabetes.
"Why do these beta cells stop
producing insulin?" Markel said.
"Are there going to be treatments
down the road that we can then
develop based on what we discov-
er about how the beta cells actu-
ally are impacted by diabetes?
This is actually throwing a whole
set of new approaches to better
understand what's happening to
the beta cells in Type 1 diabetes
so that we can ultimately have
better treatment."

Comedy 'Legend'
fails to continue

'Anchorman' sequel
fails to live up
to the original
By CONRAD FOREMAN
Daily Arts Writer
2013 was a great year for mov-
ies - a new Scorsese/DiCaprio
collaboration in "The Wolf of
Wall Street,"
another (+
David O.
Russell act- Anchorman 2:
ing clinic in TheLe end
"American
Hustle" and Continues
"12 Years a
Slave," one Rave 20 and
of the most Quality 16 -
powerful Paramount
stories ever
told on film
- were just a few of the impres-
sive achievements brought to
the big screen this year.
However, for die-hard Will
Ferrell ("Step Brothers") fans,
as well as stoners (perhaps
some overlap there?), the most
anticipated movie of the year
may have been "Anchorman 2:
The Legend Continues - " the
long-awaited sequel to 2004's
"Anchorman: The Legend of
Ron Burgundy."
This time around, Burgundy
(Ferrell) and his news team find

another opportunity to broad-
cast news in their own distinct
style, now across the coun-
try from New York, after Ron
loses his dream job to his wife,
Veronica (Christina Applegate,
TV's "Married With Children").
In this continuation of the leg-
end, the news team toes the
line of journalistic ethics and
confronts their own deteriorat-
ing friendship, while Ron Bur-
gundy struggles between his
ambition as an anchorman and
his desire to be a good husband
and father.
To (insultingly) oversimplify
it, you have two directions you
can go with comedy: you can be
silly, but witty and intelligent
(i.e. one of the silliest/smartest
shows on TV, "Community"); or
you can be stupid, but serious.
The first "Anchorman" is clas-
sic stupid-but-serious comedy.
The characters say and do ridic-
ulous things, but because they
take it (and themselves) so seri-
ously, the style works despite
the dumbed-down comedy.
"Anchorman 2" is as stupid
as its predecessor, but the story
gets lost in its silliness and fails
to recapture its charm.
Ferrell and director Adam
McKay ("The Other Guys") go
out of their way to pay homage
to the first film, which is cute
and funny at times, but mostly
feels forced. Rather than build-

ing on the magic of the first
installment, the second rides on
its coattails.
Where the film excels is in its
social commentary, which plays
a much bigger role in this sec-
ond go-round. Through their
own desire for ratings, the news
team unwittingly spawns a new
era of reporting, littered with
sound-bytes, car chases, sex
and drugs. As Burgundy says,
"Why do we have to tell the
people what they need to hear?
Why can't we just tell them
what they want to hear?"
The moral lessons Burgundy
learns in the sequel are also
more significant. In the first
film, he's able to find happi-
ness with Veronica despite her
success, but that happiness is
still contingent upon his own
success as an anchorman. We
quickly discover that he hasn't
learned much of anything. "2"
demonstrates a much greater
change in Burgundy, as he
finally learns to accept familial
harmony as a greater joy than
professional success.
In the end, though, "Anchor-
man 2: The Legend Continues"
falls flat - the brilliance found
in the spontaneous stupidity
of the first film is absent. And
at its best, the film is a you-
knew-it-was-coming barrage
of cameos that are only mildly
entertaining.

A wonderful sequence at the
beginning of Walt's adventure
places the aforementioned Life
motto onto the background
scenery, and a beautiful match-
cut with water is one of the
most memorable, fluid transi-
tions of the year. The dream
sequences are creative and
funny, although one in par-
ticular (a fight scene between
Walter and his boss, in which
they concrete-surf through the
streets of New York) drags on
too long.
Kristen Wiig ("Bridesmaids")
plays Cheryl Melhoff, Walter's
newly hired co-worker and love
interest (and thus a main sub-
ject in many of his daydreams).
More understated than in her
usual roles, Wiig is charming
and cute as a single mom facing
an almost assured lay-off from
her new job.
Behind all the main plot-
driving forces is Walt's account
on the dating website eHar-
mony, which has received zero
"winks." Throughout the film,
he receives phone calls from
Todd (Patton Oswalt, "Rata-

touille"), whose commitment
to "beefing up" Walter's profile
is either phenomenal customer
service or borderline harass-
ment. The hilarious subplot is a
key part of why "Walter Mitty"
is successful.
Predictable
storylines,
comforting
themes.
The main reason the film
works, though, is Walter's relat-
ability. His problems include
dealing with changing fam-
ily dynamics, confronting his
new asshole boss (Adam Scott,
"Step Brothers") and gathering
his courage to finally approach
the woman he admires. These
are problems virtually every-
one has faced at one point, and
Walter's daring adventure deals
with them in a way that every-
one wishes they could recreate.
While the message of the film
is obvious on the surface (just
check out the tagline: "Stop
Dreaming. Start Living."), it's
ironic that Walter only truly
lives when his reality becomes
dream-like, as opposed to find-
ing solace and peace in his
everyday life.
The end is predictable, the
lessons have been taught many
times before and most view-
ers will never have adventures
quite as grand as Walter. Still,
his "Secret Life" is a story
worth telling - and re-telling -
and worth experiencing on the
big screen.

Ultimately, their relationship
becomes more and more compli-
cated as we come to understand
that Theodore cannot simply turn
offhis relationship withcthe touch
of a button. Samantha exists
beyond Theodore's computer: she
composes music, she sings, she
draws. As an AI, she can grow to
the world around her, and she can
do so without Theodore. Slowly,
the line that defines their rela-
tionship becomes distorted.
The premise could have been
nothing more than a gimmick for
a comedy. Instead, Jonze takes
the ridiculous and morphs it into
the profound. While at first the
film seems to be concerned with
whether a love with a computer
can be real, its focus becomes
much simpler: does it matter?

irrelevant; she shapes Theodore's
life just as much as his ex-wife, as
his friends and his colleagues. As
Salman Rushdie wrote, "I am the
sum total of everything that went
before me, of all I have been seen
done, of everything done-to-me.
I am everyone everything whose
being-in-the-world affected was
affected by mine."
Arcade Fire's song "Supersym-
metry" is featured in a brief mon-
tage where we see Theodore and
Samantha first connect and fall
in love. The song adds a layer of
wonder to the scene, but it's name
rings more important. The prin-
ciple of supersymmetry proposes
that the particles of matter and
force, once thought to be separate
entities, are actually intercon-
nected by partner particles, or
superpartners. This is the heart
of "Her," to unite what is thought
to be dissonant, to imagine what
is thought to be unimaginable,
and to rediscover purpose and
hope where they had been aban-
doned.

Falling out of love sucks. At
first, you don't really know
what's going on. You look at
the other person and don't
necessarily see a stranger,
but there's
something
different,
something
off. They

their laugh UPADHYAYA
grates on
your ears.
Is it in your
head? Were these imperfec-
tions there all along and you
just found them endearing,
even sexy, before? Small
fights become big fights,
and the apologies are fewer
and farther between. You
wish things could go back to
the way they were. But they
don't. Things worsen. You've
fallen out of love, and falling
out of love sucks.
Recently, I fell out of love
with "The Vampire Diaries."
And even though we're talk-
ing about a TV show and not
a fellow human being, I can
assure you that in this case,
falling out of love still sucks.
I first fell in love with "The
Vampire Diaries" during my
freshman year. Despite my
love for Kevin Williamson
and most things supernatu-
ral, I avoided the show for
a long time. Vampires? Who
write in diaries? Please. At
the time, I was the person
I would soon came to hate,
the TV snob who was better
than the CW, the person who
insisted that network televi-
sion can't possibly hold a can-
dle to its cable superiors.
"Just get past the first four
or five episodes," my friend
and TVspiration LaToya
insisted. "It's terrible for
the first several episodes,
but then it transforms into
an amazing show. You'll be
obsessing by the end of the
week."
I was officially consider-
ing it.
"Oh, and they ditch the
diaries," she added.
OK, let's do this. I fell fast
and hard for "The Vampire
Diaries." Pretty soon, we
spent all our meals and eve-
nings together. I introduced
her to as many friends as I
could, talked about her (per-
haps a tad too often) in the
dining hall, at parties, in my
dorm room. I started calling
her by her nickname, "TVD,"
and dedicating 90 percent of
my tweets to her (almost all
of them including a generous
helping of OMGs and WTFs).
And I didn't just fall in love
with the show; I fell for its
brilliant cast, its well-written
characters, its wicked smart
creative team led by Wil-
liamson and Julie Plec. I fell
for Candice Accola in every
way. I fell for the deftness
with which Nina Dobrev so
expertly played two differ-
ent characters, to the extent
that you forget both were
her (which led me to write a
lengthy blog post about the
differences between Elena

and Katherine's physicalities
... Dobrev's mouth moves dif-
ferently depending on which
she is playing! I'm not mak-
ing this up! Look for it!). I
even fell for the emotional
tumult of it all, the fact that
no character is ever safe, that
death is as much a part of the

series's narrative fabric as
young love is.
I watched most of the first
season with LaToya (forever
thankful I finally listened
to her) and our friend Ilona.
Even though we all lived in
different states, we scheduled
group gehats, pressed play
simultaneously, and spent the
next 43-ish minutes going
through a whole range of
emotions together, because
that's what this damn show
about too-pretty teenagers
and their vampire cohorts
does to you.
It wasn't long before I
caught up and the binge-
watching had to come to an
end. But I still found ways
to spend time with "TVD"
between its Thursday night
airings. I read Price Peter-
son's flawless photo recaps
and continued, almost always
unsuccessfully, to convince
my friends to start watching.
When I read reviews dispar-
aging my favorite character,
I posted a manifesto on my
tumblr that declared my
love for Caroline Forbes, in
both her human and vampire
forms.
But something started hap-
pening during season four.
At first, I didn't really know
what was going on. I watched
"The Vampire Diaries," and
it was more or less the same
show, but there was some-
thing different, something
off. The dumb Elena-Stefan-
Damon love triangle was
suddenly taking up too much
of the narrative. Caroline
had been pushed to the back
burner. Nothing Bonnie did
made any sense anymore.
Careful character develop-
ment that had been steadily
building since season one was
balled up and thrown in the
trash. Had these imperfec-
tions been there all along and
I had just found them endear-
ing, even sexy, before? Small
qualms become big qualms,
and the redeeming quali-
ties were fewer and farther
between. I wished things
could go back to the way they
were. But they didn't. Things
worsened. I had fallen out of
love, and falling out of love
sucks ... even when it's with a
TV show.
At least in this case, I
wasn't going through it alone.
Ilona stopped watching
entirely. LaToya returned to
the early seasons so she could
remember how things used
to be. Reviews became more
and more critical. Ratings
for season five have dropped,
on average, by one to two
million from what they were
per episode in the first two
seasons.
I could forgive some of the
baseless character changes
and story missteps. Most
shows slump at some point.
And season four, despite its
troublesome sire bond plot
and overemphasis on the love
triangle, also includes epi-
sodes that embody everything
"TVD" does well: "Memorial"
jerks tears from even the
most heartless of monsters
while also serving up a blind-
ing dose of suspense.
But now, we're in the midst

of season five, and "The Vam-
pire Diaries" doesn't just look
unfamiliar; it has morphed
into something absurd, toxic,
even nauseating. Love has
taken center stage, and the
show that once burst with
themes of family and friend-
ship now sags with some seri-

ously fucked up philosophies
on romance. The once strong
and clear-sighted Caroline
has melted into a helpless,
lovesick vamp who clings to
her fading relationship with
Tyler. Elena constantly asks
herself: Stefan? Or Damon?
When really, she should be
asking: Can't I just be single
for once and stop letting these
men dictate my every move?
The writers room also
seems to have become
obsessed with the concept of
post-traumatic stress disor-
der. The writing feels sloppy,
as if someone opened up their
kid's psych textbook, found
a basic definition of PTSD
and said "yeah, let's do that,"
without trying to connect it
to the characters' emotions
or the story's trajectory. So
now, Stefan suffers from
PTSD. Which, yeah, makes
sense. I mean, the dude was
trapped in a sealed vault and
tossed into a river, where he
drowned, died, and came back
to life about a thousand times
over the course of several
months. That's going to take
a psychological toll on a fella.
Caroline attempts to cure him
by trapping him in the very
vault which causes his trauma
(a solution she pulls from her
own psych textbook), but it's
Katherine who finally gets
through to Stefan. In the
process, Katherine reveals
that Stefan's PTSD results
not from the whole drowning
repeatedly for months thing
but rather because of ... wait
for it ... Elena dumping him.
Huh?
I get it. We all do stupid
things for love. We've all had
tiny panic attacks when some-
one doesn't reply to a text
message in less than three
seconds. We've all wondered
about exes and read too much
into tweets, putting subtext
where there is none. And
I'm not suggesting "TVD"
eliminate love from its the-
matic spinnings entirely; it
would lose an essential part
of itself. It hasn't always got-
ten romance wrong. Early on,
Caroline and Tyler's relation-
ship was wonderfully com-
plex, and Rebekah and Matt's
unlikely pairing glistened
with honesty. For a while, the
show's characters were so
intertwined in each others'
lives that it seemed anyone
could hook up with anyone
and it would make sense on a
deeper, more emotional level
beyond just "they're both
pretty."
But the current season of
"The Vampire Diaries" has a
lot to say about love, and none
of it is healthy: Do anything
for love, even if that means
placing yourself or others in
danger; love is all that mat-
ters; love love love. The show's
current conception of love
resembles that of a pre-teen
who still doesn't know or
understand anything about
this nebulous concept beyond
the borders of their diary.
Well, I'm sorry, "TVD," but
I don't love you anymore. I
can't love you anymore. But
if you want to win my love
back, you can start by letting
these characters remember

who they are, what they care
about, what drives and scares
and worries them. Because
right now, they look like
strangers.

TV R EVIEW
Stae jkeson (djidnght

ByJOE REINHARD
DailyArts Writer
Sometimes, a good idea on
paper doesn't turn out as well
when brought to life. Comedy
Central's "@
Midnight" B-
might not
always be a @Midnight
show with
this prob- Season Two
lem, but the Premiere
season two MondaytoThursday
premiere
certainly at12a.m.
indicates Comedy Central
that this
might be the
case. At the very least, the show
doesn't have a good enough
handle yet to make its strong
mix of ideas into an excellent
program.
The show is led by a panel of
guest comedians who do improv
comedy under a mock game
show format that largely draws
from absurd material on the
web. The show, hosted by Chris
Hardwick, pulls from a variety
of places - including "Jeopar-
dy!" and Hardwick's own "Web
Soup" - which creates an inter-
esting premise. Over the course
of its 30-minute runtime, how-
ever, it becomes pretty clear
that the show's premise might
not be enough. In fact, as it
stands now, the premise is what
holds the show back from pro-
ducing consistently great com-
edy.

Consistency is the key word
here. "@Midnight" does have
some laughs, particularly in
its stronger second half where
more jokes hit than miss. Of
course, the improvisational
nature of the show entails that
at least some jokes will fall flat,
but the number of things that
simply don't work is too obvious
to ignore.
This is where the show's
game show format becomes
problematic. Too often, the
panel of comedians struggle
to produce something funny
because the questions and
tasks are too restricting. In
one round, the comedians had
to say what pinboard a Pinter-
est photo should be posted to,
and each response was under-
whelming. An eerie black and
white photo of a man holding
a deer skull over his face isn't
the worst choice for such an
activity, but it failed to generate
funny responses that we know
each of the individual panelists
are capable of. To the show's
credit, having three guests
increases the chances of at least
one joke being funny, but when
all three fail to deliver, it's hard
to watch. The problem lies in
how the format prevents them
from moving on when a weird
Tweet, video, or Instagram
photo clearly isn't working out.
It isn't that the comedi-
ans involved aren't funny.
The particular guests for this
episode - Kumail Nanjiani

("Franklin & Bash), Paul Scheer
("NTSF:SD:SUV"), and Andrea
Savage ("Step Brothers") - all
have impressive comedy resu-
mes, and each manages to bring
about some genuinely hilarious
moments. Chris Hardwick, love
him or hate him, has plenty of
experience hosting, including
experience hosting a show with
internet based content, and
does a decent job. Each person
helps stop the show from sink-
ing to mediocrity. It just doesn't
rise to greatness, either.
Don't stay up
for this one.
In theory, the mock game
show format should provide a
fun and unique backdrop for
the comedians to work with.
Unfortunately, "@Midnight"
ends up creating something
that isn't as fun or as engag-
ing as it could be. If the show
placed more emphasis on the
game show elements (which
it doesn't, seeing how points
are awarded according to what
Hardwick finds funny and not
under a balanced, objective sys-
tem), that would be one thing,
but when the show's clearly out
for laughs first and foremost,
the inconsistency is hard to for-
give.

Ann Arbor can't be condensed into one paragraph, one
story or one magazine. Ann Arbor is a bastion for art and
intellect and freedom and ambition and fun, and no single
publication could ever encompass all that the city has to
offer. During the year, the Michigan Daily strives to expose
readers to all sides of campus and the city it calls home, but
once a year, when the flowers begin to bloom and gradu-
ation looms ever closer, we take a step back to appreciate
the best that Ann Arbor has to offer. This year, the Best of
Ann Arbor issue contains the restaurants, stores and bars
most cherished in the hearts of University students and
Ann Arbor residents alike. Whether you are a new student,
yearning to discover the best spot to coolly drink coffee and
talk politics, or a long-time alum hoping to reconnect with
your alma mater, this list will be a good start.
Happy exploring.

I happened upon Isalita one
night with a friend. It was the
end of Thanksgiving break, and
after an exhausting day we were
in search of some good Mexi-
can food and a place to rest our
tired feet. Isalita didn't disap-
point, and since then, I've been

back whenever the opportunity
for a nice dinner out arises.
The atmosphere is sophisti-
cated and classy, and the food
is fantastic. I recommend the
peel & eat shrimp and the Mex-
ico City mushroom quesadilla,
though I've enjoyed everything

I've had there. The different
dishes are perfect for sharing
with a group of friends - and
if you're planning on going
with 5 or more others, make
sure to call ahead for a reser-
vation, as Isalita is constantly
crowded. Though the prices

may be a bit out of a student's
budget, if you're in search of
a nice night out and willing to
sacrifice a few hours of work
at Espresso Royale or Bert's
Cafe, Isalita is well worth a
short walk down East Liberty.

Coffee

After an early 8 a.m. class
or a long day of homework and
exams, Espresso Royale pro-
vides a much-needed solace with
its cushy chairs, soothing music
and hot coffee and tea.
Its ability to create an invit-
ing and homey environment has
earned Espresso Royale a warm
place in the hearts of the Ann

Arbor community. Conveniently
situated on both State Street and
South University, the coffee shop
is never more than a short walk
away. The baristas are always
friendly and quick to help. The
service is very efficient and you
may have coffee in your hands
almost as soon as you order it.
The menu offers a large repre-

sentation of delicious coffees
and tea. The shop also offers a
variety of warm baked goods and
sandwiches that make it easy to
grab a quick lunch when on the
go.
Royale's many chairs, tables
and couches make the shop per-
fect for afternoon study group
meetings, cramming for an

exam or just leisurely reading
and book and sipping coffee on
a couch. Whether providing stu-
dents with a place to escape from
the cold winters or unwind after
an exam, Espresso Royale pro-
vides Ann Arbor with a unique
local coffee shop that caters to
its student's needs.

Where I grew up, we didn't have
Bruegger's Bagels. So unlike many
of my peers who grew up with a
Bruegger's on every other corner,
when I came to the University, the
restaurant was an entirely new
concept to me. Tucked into a small
storefront on North University,
the chain is unassuming among
the more exotic cultural findings
Ann Arbor has to offer. Hiding

behind Bruegger's simple fagade,
however, lies the best selection of
warm, dense, cream-cheese-laden
bagels in Ann Arbor.
Possibly the greatest joy of
my childhood was the few times
every year my babysitter would
take me to Krispy Kreme. (Simple
pleasures, I guess?) I was surpris-
ingly indifferent to the donuts, but
fascinated with looking through

the glass windows at the perfect
machinated conveyor belt spitting
out donut after donut.
Walking into Bruegger's for the
first time you get the same visual
experience; as you order your
bagel from choices including the
savory asiago parmesan, decadent
chocolate chip and traditional
everything, you can watch soon-
to-be-bagel dough floating to the

top of a giant metal bagel-maker
- a magical collision of food and
science.
Though simple, Bruegger's sup-
plies classically delicious New
York style bagels with a nostalgic
view of the way they are made.
At just $3 a bagel, it's hard to not
appreciate this fast and functional
meal.

Restaurant

As my last name would sug-
gest, I'm Italian, which is to
say that there's only one voice
I truly respect when it comes
to culinary wisdom - my own
little Italian grandma, Adeline
DePollo.
Since coming to Ann Arbor,
however, I've had to add anoth-
er voice to my list of experts on
the subject: Gratzi.

Built inside what was once
the Orpheum Theater, the
restaurant is gorgeous. From
the massive bay window look-
ing out over Main Street to
the paintings of Orpheus and
an ancient Greek bacchanalia
hanging above the dining room,
few other restaurants in Ann
Arbor can boast such sumptu-
ous and elegant decor.

But Gratzi's real strength lies
in its Head Chef, John Fisher.
The man is an artist, constant-
ly creating fresh new takes on
traditional Italian dishes with
close attention to flavor, pre-
sentation and the history of
the food he loves. Each month,
Fisher crafts a new menu built
around the flavors of a different
region of Italy, bringing recipes

to Ann Arbor rarely seen out-
side the confines of the penin-
sula.
Though the menu is always
changing, the quality of food
and service remains consistent-
ly high at Gratzi - and it's the
only place outside of my grand-
ma's kitchen that you can find a
truly excellent plate of gnocchi.

Best Late

Ilizi~ia Ilo s

Oh, Pizza House and your
divine cheesy creations. Are you
the bane of late-night partygo-
ers or the perfect culmination of
a night out with friends? Are you
the abominable diet destroyer or
the super taste-bud teaser? Do you
want to make my stomach curdle
and churn or do you want to make
it joyous? These are the questions
we demand an answer to. And

here are the charges we bring
against you:
1) You are so subtly addictive.
God only knows what kind of spe-
cial concoction could make cheese
and bread so majestic.
2) Your late-night availability
only makes you crueler. How dare
you try to exploit the money-blow-
ing habits of hungry and impres-
sionable individuals.

3) No amount of fair-pricing or
generous food portioning could
justify your late-night snacking
monopoly. Okay, this third point
is false.
Pizza House, no one knows
exactly what your ambitions for
world-domination-after-dark
may be, but we're on to you. Your
feta cheesy bread, your pizza
pockets, calzones and chipatis are

exceptional. The convenience of
your nocturnal operation is com-
mendable. The tempting aromas
of your foodstuffs that fill off-
campus walkways are outrageous.
You are tasty, you are reliable and
you are clever. You may rule the
world of late-night snacks for now,
but we're on to you. We are so on
to you.

Sandwich


Like the 1927 Yankees or eager high school seniors touring

the "bottomless" party scene
in "Harold and Kumar Escape
from Guantanamo Bay," some
things just seem too good to
be true. Except they really are
true. Zingerman's is one of those
places. Ask any Ann Arbor resi-
dent where you should eat, and
Zingerman's comes up, usually
accompanied by a soft sigh and
an "oh my god." Everyone, from

campus to a certain Commander
in Chief with a fondness for Reu-
bens, must make the journey to
Kerrytown when they visit.
The long wait outside on a
brisk Saturday, even on a game
day, is worth it. The walls,
shelves and glass cases are
stuffed with an overwhelming
bounty of food - breads and
cheeses and cured meats and

salads and seemingly every-
thing else humanity regards as
delicious. You want everything,
so badly that you consider buy-
ing the whole store. The menu,
with several dozen sandwiches,
makes the agonizing decision
worse. When you finally make
the call, and the slightly easier
one of a half sour or old garlic
pickle, you find a table, and long-
ingly wait to hear your name as if

the caller is a long-lost lover.
It finally comes, and you take
that first glorious bite. The pas-
trami and corned beef is com-
parable to a New York deli's, but
the bread is worlds better; crusty
and dense, it puts the rye in rye
bread. With a Dr. Brown's soda,
a basket of latke fritters and that
all important pickle, it's a meal
worth any wait or any walk.

Mediterranean


Jerusalem Garden sits on the
corner of E. Liberty and 5th
avenue in a small, quiet yellow
house. Inside, you'll find the
cash register greets you not two
steps from the entryway, and a
small counter in the corner in
front of a grill that seems to take
up the entire room. It's a modest
establishment, sure, but there's a

reason why so many Mediterra-
nean food enthusiasts pack into
its narrow halls day in and day
out. The proprietors know their
falafel.
They know their kabobs and
shwarma, too. They choose to
grill their meats instead of skew-
er them, like the more tradition-
al and abundant Mediterranean

restaurants in Ann Arbor. For
vegetarians, Jerusalem Garden
offers impressively tasty falafel
sandwiches and plates, as well
as various salads and soups. And,
of course, their main dishes are
served on or with a pita and deli-
cious hummus.
As an added bonus, the food
is highly affordable, yet does not

suffer in terms of quality. A small
patio out front offers fresh air to
the otherwise tight quarters. It's
perfect for students on those
rare but always-welcome warm-
er blue-sky days. Take a seat,
grab a sandwich and embrace
the classic Ann Arbor goodness
that is Jerusalem Garden.

A haircut is a haircut is a hair-
cut, right? If we're just talking
about the very service of getting
a trim, then yes ... sort of. Like
car problems or brewing beer, it's
something you know a bit about
but would rather just leave to a pro-
fessional. In short, you can walk
into pretty much any barber shop,
say "I need a haircut," give a very
vague explanation of what you

want and in thirty minutes you'll
be good. In a pinch, this works.
But why settle? What's great about
Coach and Four, located at the
south end of campus, is that it com-
bines the reliability expected from
any barbershop with a unique and
enduring personality.
The actual haircuts are wonder-
ful. The barbers can tell how long
it's been since you last came in at

a glance and can take a vague "I
don't want it too short," and turn
it into a date-ready cut. Best of all,
each haircut is concluded with a
neck shave, except here it's done
with warm shaving cream and a
straight razor.
And if it's true that a barbershop
is all about the ambiance, then
Coach and Four gets a full score.
This review wouldn't be complete

without mentioning the free beer
and Playboys, but even without
them, the Michigan sports memo-
rabilia on the walls lets anyone
who walks in know that this is a
barbershop that could only exist in
Ann Arbor. So, if you need a hair-
cut, or just some advice on your
bracket, Coach and Four is the
place for you.

_____________________________________________________________A

There are plenty of places to
shop in downtown Ann Arbor,
but for a college student on a bud-
get, perusing the sale racks at the
staple stores can get old pretty
fast.
Luckily, just a couple of blocks
down E. Liberty Street from the

main State Street drag, is Rag-
stock - the low cost little sister
to American Apparel and Urban
Outfitters. Whether you're look-
ing forward to summer with a
new pair of denim cutoffs or in
search of an oversized Bill Cosby
sweater to throw on over leg-

gings, Ragstock is the ultimate
haven for college students with
dusty wallets.
Peek inside the store and you'll
find racks upon racks of second-
hand and vintage clothing, rang-
ing from outrageous accessories
for crafting the perfect Hallow-

een costume to basic tanks and
tee shirts for everyday wear.
Walking into Ragstock's dimly
lit, pattern-filled storefront is
like pulling on a familiar pair of
worn-in jeans (the very kind that
the store itself probably sells).

Good times, fast times, high
times, right times - World of Beer
doesn't distinguish among them.
Come for the variety, stay for the
atmosphere. Interesting people
and their stories abound. The peo-
ple who go to WOB (an aptly coined
abbreviation for the bar riveting
with youth and personality) are the
people who want to make the most
of their night - and their budget.

World of Beer boasts "The
Finest Craft Beer, Culture and
Experience" while respecting the
moderate purchasing power of its
collegiate customers. Students can
select from a wide array of seasonal
brews, delicate crafts and flavor-
ful experiments. Anyone homesick
for the taste of a local draught can
flip through the multi-paged menu,
locate their state and choose from

the listing of subset breweries. It's
a healthy way to bask in regional
pride, but also to share with friends,
co-workers or date partners the
special taste of home.
For many people, the bars they
frequent become qualitative enti-
ties that take on a life-like, friendly
form. Emotions poured into sports
games, jokes invested into date
nights, gambles taken on orders

that include risky new dishes - all
of these actions create a kind of rela-
tionship with the bar itself, one that
is subject to high points and low
points, turbulence and triumph.
WOB is like the cool new guy in
town. With a clean slate, it's taking
the campus by storm. Everyone
wants a new friend. WOB says: let
the good times roll.

When your inner hipster is ready to the racks of records and ironic cof-

floral-print dresses and Native Amer- such a wide selection of fashionable

to go out on the town - and don't kid
yourself, we all have one - there's
only one store that sells the right
attire: a perfect blend of casual and
chic, comfort and class. That store is
Urban Outfitters.
From itsunique location justbelow
the iconic Art Deco State Theater sign

fee table books lining its walls, Urban
Outfitters offers the Ann Arbor com-
munity a selection of clothing drip-
ping with practiced diffidence and
an atmosphere that all but screams "I
liked them before it was cool."
No other outlet provides the same
variety of non-standard pant colors,

ican-inspired sweaters. Nowhere else
can you buy an OBEY hat, Icona Pop
on vinyl and a novelty beer can hel-
met without making three separate
trips. And, thanks to an ever-chang-
ing clearance rack and frequent sales
celebrating the less popular Ameri-
can holidays, no other outlet offers

clothing and culturally relevant knick
knacks at prices reasonable enough
to fit into a college student's budget.
Plus, it's the only place you can buy
Blake's bear coat from "Workahol-
ics." Thank you for the profile pic-
ture, Urban Outfitters.

Washtenaw Dairy is danger-
ously unassuming, Surrounded
by Ann Arbor homes and beyond
the outskirts of campus, you
could walk right past the dull
brown bricks without even real-
izing what you missed out on. It
isn't luring people in with blar-
ing music, flashy signs or even a
sign at all, but with simply the
best ice cream you can find in
Ann Arbor,

Walking through the door is
a trip to a simpler time. Regu-
lars debate the day's news over
freshly-made donuts in the back
corner. Locals mill about, watch-
ing the Tigers game on the TV or
watching downtown Ann Arbor
on the horizon, all with gigantic
ice cream cones in hand. Servers
mingle with customers, recom-
mending flavors and weighing in
on conversations.

Contrary to the South U. strip,
no one here is on deadline. No
one is stressed, everyone cares,
in a society that becomes faster-
paced and harsher by the min-
ute, Washteuaw iairy is a break
from it all, Where a single scoop
is secretly a triple, ice cream is
given time to taste its best and
profits take a backseat; where
smiles and friendships are more
important than efficiency and

revenue; where the number one
goal has been to give customers a
refreshing treat since 1931,
It isn't fro-yo, it isn't trendy,
it isn't hip - it's simply great ice
cream for a greater price, it isn't
a pit stop in the bustle of down-
town, it's a destination, where
time and worries take a break,
it's Washtenaw Dairy, and it's
what dessert should be,

Burg er


VIRGINIA LOZANO/Daily

To find the best burger in Ann
Arbor, you'll have to look beyond
the likely candidates - Five Guys,
Charley's, BurgerFi - and start
thinking outside the box. Located
past Main Street on W. Washing-
ton, Frita Batidos uniquely blends
cultures and flavors, making it one
of the most interesting, exciting
and talked-about restaurants in
Ann Arbor.

Described by its founders as
"Cuban inspired street food," Frita
Batidos is known for its creative
variation on burgers and shakes.
The Frita - a burger typically
made from spicy chorizo (though
chicken, fish and beef are also
offered) - pairs perfectly with the
Batido - tropical milkshakes made
with fresh fruit, sweetened milk
and rum.

If that's not enough, the Frita's
toppings take this meal to the next
level. Every burger is served below
shoestring fries and between a soft
egg bun. If you're feeling brave,
"make it loco," and add Muenster
cheese, a sunny side up egg, cilan-
tro-lime salsa, tropical slaw and
avocado spread for a truly unfor-
gettable experience.
Many have praised Frita Batidos

- including the Daily's own food
columnist, Nate Wood - for its
delicious drinks, sensational sides
and authentic atmosphere. But its
burger, or Frita, stands above the
rest. If you haven't yet experienced
this Ann Arbor hotspot, put it on
your to-do list. Or, rather, put it at
the top of that list..

If you're a fan of grinding up
against sweaty, Greek-affiliated
under-21s after downing five
slushy cups of brownish ice that
cost a dollar - "Long Island
Iced Tea" is far too generous a
label - then Ashley's probably
isn't the bar for you.
If you're willing to shell out
a few extra bucks for a nicer

drink, a calmer vibe and a
crowd more likely to be dis-
cussing politics than which frat
star is buying the next pitcher
of Miller Lite, head over to Ash-
ley's.
With 70 beers on tap, 70
more in bottles and the option
to explore your choices prior to
your visit with a comprehensive

online catalogue, Ashley's is
unparalleled in its selection of
quality craft beers from around
the globe. Its wait staff knows
every drink on the menu, and
its vibe is lively without being
overwhelming.
Beer isn't the only game in
town, either - once you've
downed a brew or five, you

can try French fries doused in
anything from stilton to curry
sauce to cheese curds, spicy
Buffalo wings, and an impres-
sive variety of burgers, pizzas
and more. Whether you're there
for a beer, a snack, a harder
beverage, or any and all of the
above, Ashley's can't be beat.

Increasingly popular among
even the blandest of palates,
sushi - once considered strange
and exotic by the average Ameri-
can - is now enjoyed by anyone
and everyone. Sadako, conve-
niently located on South Uni-
versity, is bound to satisfy any
Ann Arborite's sushi craving,
whether you're adventurous or
still cautious about the concept

of consuming raw fish. The rolls
are prepared fresh, the service is
fast, and orders are available for
carry out or as a sit-down meal in
the clean and casual atmosphere
of the restaurant.
Sadako's low prices and high
quality make sushi an available
option for even the invariably
broke college student, and once
you've had your first taste, you're

hooked. The menu ranges from
beginner California Rolls to more
curious options, such as eel, octo-
pus or squid. (I myself get mys-
terious craving throughout the
week for the deep-fried Sunny
roll, filled with salmon and cream
cheese, an option I imagine
embodies everything sushi isn't
meant to be.)
Sushi isn't your thing? Sadako

offers various soups and salads,
noodle dishes and rice bowls
to keep the picky eaters happy.
It's the jackpot combination of a
varied, inexpensive menu that's
served quick and is most impor-
tantly delicious. Reasons that are
undoubtedly why Ann Arbor's
residents keep coming year after
year.

Thai Food

No T hai!


You know how sometimes you
just crave Chinese food? And it
can't be any Chinese food - it's
got to be the most beautifully
Americanized blend of comfort
food. Sometimes you've just got a
hankering for hot-and-sour soup.
You're jittery for General Tso's.
Ornery until you get your orange
chicken fix.
No Thai fills that niche for Thai

food. It's fresh, flavorful, and maybe
most importantly, fast. Located on
South University Ave, this restau-
rant is a mecca for those who want
a steamy Pad Seeyu, and want it
now. What sets No Thai apart from
the rest is its combination of qual-
ity and speed. Try the signature
Pad Thai, infused with its famous
pad thai sauce and topped with the
perfect amount of crushed peanuts

to mix in - not too much, not too
little. Or sample the drunken noo-
dles, delicious whether you match
the state of the noodles or not.
Whatever you end up choos-
ing, you'll eat it amid No Thai's
cheerful color scheme and fun
music. The restaurant cultivates a
bright, friendly vibe appropriate
for informal dates, outings with
friends, or even casual interviews.

Its playfulness is obvious down to
the menu, which allows custom-
ers to select among different, cus-
tomizable spice levels called Weak
Sauce, Medium, Yoga Flame, and
Dim Mak - the last is also known
as The Death Touch, so if you're
adventurous or trying to impress
your date, then this one's for you.

Angelo's, located on Catherine
Street amid the quaintness that
is Kerrytown, is an Ann Arbor
staple. A true family business,
Angelo Vangelatos came to Ann
Arbor from Greece in 1951 with
his soon-to-be wife Patricia
Verames. They worked hard to
establish Angelo's, which was
thriving by the 1970s. Later, their

son Steve took over and carries on
Angelo's delicious legacy today.
With an in-house bakery,
Angelo's homemade bread is a
must. They've recently added a
Portabello Benedict to their spe-
cials - a delicious vegetarian
option topped with tomato and
hollandaise sauce to complement
their crisp bacon, turkey sausage,

lox and other breakfast treats.
With its Mediterranean heritage,
a simple Greek salad at Angelo's
seems like a good choice.
Angelo's embraces Ann
Arbor's community culture - not
just the city's culinary tastes, but
its artists as well. Illustrations by
local artist Michael C. Konas line
the walls, complemented by Uni-

versity alum Joyce Lieberman's
"UNStill Life" series.
Breakfast at Angelo's is a tasty
and comforting way to start the
day. A glass of fresh-squeezed
orange juice (authentic at "mar-
ket price") and a stack of cinna-
mon raisin pancakes - how could
anything go wrong after that?

WHIPPED IN

WISCONSI N

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
WHAT HAPPENED FRI-
DAY: For the fourth time the
No. 8 Michigan hockey team
flung shot after shot at the net
- 56 in total - but managed to
find twine just twice, this time
against No. 14 Wisconsin.
Wisconsin [RI)AY
(4-2 Big-
Ten, 13-6- MICHIGAN 2
1 overall) WISCONSIN 5
jumped
out to an
early lead MICHIGAN 1
with two WISCONSIN 3
goals in the
first period. Though Michigan
players were quick to call most
of the Badgers' five goals "fluky,"
the early deficit was too steep
for the Wolverines (2-2, 10-6-2)
to overcome, despite their two
late goals in the third period, as
they fell, 5-2.
SLOW START: The Wolver-
ines rode a 125-minute scoreless
streak dating back to Dec. 27
at the Great Lakes Invitational
all the way into the third peri-
od before sophomore forward
Andrew Copp buried his team-
leading 15th goal of the season.
Berenson has said a good
start has been trademark of all
prolific Michigan teams. So two
periods without a score was
uncharacteristic for a team that
outscored opponents 17-6 in the
first frame through the first half
of the season.
BIG ICE, BIG PROBLEM:
Seven feet wider than Yost Ice
Arena, the Kohl Center may
have had no effecton Michigan's
performance this weekend,
but the team has certainly had
problems adjusting to different
ice conditions.
On a larger rink in New
Hampshire, the then-rolling
Wolverines narrowly escaped
two overtime defeats. And
outside at Comerica Park in
December, the Wolverines were
shut out for the first time.
Michigan will likely see big-
ger ice on more than one occa-
sion the rest of the season.

WHAT HAPPENED
SATURDAY: Though Michigan
got off to a better start than it
had Friday, the same problems
that plagued the Wolverines
in Friday'sloss were far fro
eliminated. Against a strong
Wisconsin penalty kill and lights-
out goaltending by Joel Rumpel
for a second time, the Wolverines
struggled to find success. Though
the shot selection was slightly
improved, Michigan scored only
once.
With the score 2-1 in
Wisconsin'sfavorafter18minutes
of back-and forth-hockey in the
third period, Michigan's hopes of
escaping the weekend with a split
were put to rest when Badgers
forward Joseph Labate netted
a breakaway attempt to push
his team's lead to two. With 41
seconds remaining, an apparent
goal from freshman forward JT
Compher was overturned, and
the clock ran down.
NAGELVOORT NEEDS
HELP: Freshman goaltender
Zach Nagelvoort - who allowed
four goals on Friday, tying a sea-
son high - got the nod for the
second matchup. And again,
Nagelvoort did his job. He com-
pleted 33 saves on Saturday to
keep Michigan in the game,
allowing just two goals despite
many more scoring chances from
a potent Wisconsin offense that
ranks in the top 10 nationally.
What's more, the defense
began to let up in the second
period. The unit allowed 23 shots
through two frames and turned
the puck over several times.
THE BRAWL: Beginning
when sophomore forward
Andrew Copp skated up behind a
Wisconsin player and shoved him
into the boards and onto his back.
As he skated away, the Badgers on
ice swarmed Copp, and punches
were thrownbetweenboth teams
as helmets went flying.
The scrambles resulted in four
ejections, including Copp, senior
forward Derek DeBlois and
junior forward Alex Guptill for
Michigan. However, they are eli-
gible for their next game, accord-
ing to NCAA rules.

MADISON - Andrew
Copp returned to Ann Arbor
this past Sunday, tired and
jet-lagged after competing
with the USA World Junior
team in Sweden since Dec.
27. His arrival came nearly
two weeks after the rest of
the team was on campus after
the holiday season, and at
practice Wednesday, he said
he was still trying to get back
into the swing of things.
But the sophomore for-
ward didn't show many signs
of fatigue throughout No. 9
Michigan's two-game series
at No. 14 Wisconsin this
weekend. As he has for much
of the season, Copp remained
the lone bright spot for an
offensive unit that's been
lulled into a sleep for the past

month.
Dating back to Dec. 11,
Michigan has scored seven
goals in five games, all of them
resultinginlosses. Itnarrowly
escaped being shutout in con-
secutive outings for the first
time since the 1942-43 sea-
son, thanks only to Copp's late
power play goal in the third
period of Friday's 5-2 loss.
Senior forward Luke Moffatt
added the second tally min-
utes later, but it was too little
for a team that needed pro-
duction 58 minutes earlier.
The Wolverines' potential
to score a few goals every
night is high on paper, but the
talent hasn't materialized into
"W's" on the ice.
"(Copp's) playing hard,
and he's establishing himself
again in the second half as
one of our top players," said
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "We just need more play-
ers getting into that groove."

best scorers, and arguably best
players off all classes - seniors
Derek DeBlois and Mac Ben-

Each one had been on the ice
after freshman goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort had been pulled
and all of whom were quiet and
motionless with the exception
of the chatty Guptill. They col-
lectively looked up at the screen
after a matter of seconds for a
replay and then turned to the
officials to learn their fate.
Six men in the box at once!
It symbolized everything about
the weekend for the Wolver-
ines. The offense was bottled
up, with little room to push the
puck around. The defense was
trapped in its own zone early
and often.
With 33 seconds to go, trail-
ing 3-1, Michigan faced a series
sweep and its fourth consecu-
tive loss as the massive penal-
ties were handed down. In the
penalty box, the Wolverines
presented as much of a threat
to win off the ice as they did on
the ice.

Offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier (left) and coach Brady Hoke (right) are known for their recruiting success, but it takes coaching to develop players.

That's the reason why Michi-
gan's secondary - full of highly
recruited players - was torched
by a junior college transfer at
quarterback and a two-star
recruit at wide receiver in the
loss to Kansas State in Tempe.
That's the reason why the
top-three players in Michigan's
2012 recruiting class have done
a whole lot of nothing in two
seasons in Ann Arbor, while
three-star recruit Willie Henry
became one of the best Wol-
verine defensive tackles down
the stretch. He's done better
than defensive back Terry Rich-
ardson, who didn't see game
action this year, and Royce
Jenkins-Stone, who played in
one game this year asa reserve
linebacker, and offensive guard
Kyle Kalis, who only regained
his starting job after walk-on
Joey Burzynski tore his ACL.
Rankings and stars only mat-
ter so much. They can only get
your program so far.
Maybe Nussmeier will be
the magic touch. Maybe he'll
be the one missing component
in the current talent divide on
this football team, at least on
offense. Or, maybe he won't.
But as we saw in 2013, the
Jimmy's and Joe's - as highly

rankings seem to keep every-
thing afloat amidst the sinking

Hoke is known for his prow-

the 12th-best class in the nation
for 2014 after the sixth-best
class in 2013 and the seventh-
best in 2012.

doesn't matter.
7-6 matters. Getting blown

Watching Michigan State win

Wolverines down Purdue

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 18 Michigan wres-
tling team overcame a slow
start Friday evening to win its
Big Ten opener, 22-12, against
No. 20 Purdue at Cliff Keen
Arena.
The Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten,
5-2 overall) started off with a
win in the 125-pound weight
class by redshirt freshman
Conor Youtsey. That opening
match was a fine representation
of the first quarter of the duel,
where Michigan had trouble
putting themselves in a posi-
tion to wrestle with a lead.
Michigan then took the
matches in the 165-, 174-, 184-
and heavyweight classes in
an impressive domination of
the final three-quarters of the
meet.
Youtsey dominated the third
period and ended up walking
away with an opening 7-4 deci-
sion at 125 pounds.
A quick start has been a
focus preached by the coaching
staff all year, and it looked as if
Michigan had gotten just that.
"Purdue has a lot of scrappy
guys," said Michigan coach Joe

McFarland. "We got a nice win
from Youtsey at 125. He start-
ed off a little sluggish in that
match but was able to finish."
But the next two Wolverines
weren't able to push through
adversity quite as well as Yout-
sey.
Michigan sent sophomore
Rossi Bruno to the mat for the
133-pound weight class match.
Failing to get out to an early
lead has been a problem for
Bruno, and that issue flared up
again against the Boilermakers
(0-3, 3-3).
Bruno gave up a takedown
with just 25 seconds left in
the first period and fought
from behind for the rest of the
match. The match eventually
came down to double overtime,
where Bruno gave up an escape
to go down by a point in the first
of two 30-second extra periods.
In the second half of the sec-
ond overtime, Bruno had just
30 seconds to take back the
point he had given up, but was
unable to do so, and Purdue
took the duel to a 3-3 tie.
Next up was redshirt fresh-
man Angelo Larota at 141
pounds. After a back-and-forth
first two periods, the third was

dominated by the Boilermak-
ers, earning them a 6-3 lead in
the duel.
At the 149-pound weight
class, fifth-year senior Eric
Grajales provided a solid out-
ing, bringing home a 6-3 deci-
sion to push the duel to an early
6-6 tie.
It's a position Grajales has
been in multiple times this sea-
son; when the team flounders
early and then looks for a vet-
eran in the middle of the lineup
to set the tone for the Wolver-
ines in the remaining matches,
Grajales has answered that call
nearly every time.
Freshman Brian Murphy
came through next at 157
pounds and pushed Michigan
into the lead at 9-6.
The meet was the first step
for the Wolverines as they head
into a Big Ten schedule that
features six of the top 11 teams
in the country.
"(A strong start) is very
important," Grajales said.
"Sometimes it's hard to get
going if you get your head
down, so you have to start
strong and continue through.
It's motivation through the
whole season."

of those moments helped Jon Horford that helped seal
Michigan to its victory. the win.

the pivotal shot.
So when the Wolverines
were down by one with 30 sec-
onds remaining, the designed
play wasn't just an isolation
play that Michigan had grown
so accustomed to last year with
Burke.
"It was actually something
(Walton's) been working on,
we've been working on, that
particular play," Beilein told
reporters after Thursday's
game. "He just took it right at
him and scored. He had some
other options; he didn't look at
those other options. He looked
to score. That was one of the
options: go in and score.
"If it blew up at all, we were
going to call timeout. With that
amount of time on the clock, we
wanted to see if we could get
them quick before they could
set."
While the play called for
multiple possibilities, the one
that unfolded showed the
aggressiveness of Walton -
something the guard hadn't
been called upon to display in
the final stretches of play.
"I think it's great for him,"
Morgan said Thursday. "I think
it's been a little bit difficult for
him to find out where he can
get his looks and where he kind
of has to pull back. We want
him to be aggressive and keep
putting pressure on the rim
because it makes the (opposi-
tion) honor that and gets every-
one else open."
With that newly found con-
fidence, the decision for Beilein
of who will take the shot with
the game on the line just got
tougher. Another option has
emerged.

yard butterfly in 1:51.37.
What was most surpris-
ing was that senior John
Wojciechowski, who had been
Michigan's lead backstroker
earlier in the season, was not
the Wolverines' top finisher
in the individual backstroke
races.
Instead, senior Ryutaro
Kamiya took full control of the
stroke, winning both the 100-
yard and 200-yard events in
49.63 and 1:46.20, respectively.
Backstroke has been one
of the few question marks for
Michigan after the departure
of Miguel Ortiz last season.
"We're still looking for our
relay backstroker," Bottom
said. "(Wojciechowski) swam
some freestyle today and a but-
terfly in a relay, so we're still
working on filling that spot."
Kamiya's performance over
the weekend was encouraging,
but, like the rest of his team, he
has plenty of room to improve
once the team can taper and
recover from the intensity of
the midseason and brutal trav-
el schedule.
"The guys are tired," Bosch
said, "but all the traveling and
that stuff, it makes you better."

but his shot was pushed to the

The second period of Satur-
day's rematch provided the most
promising chances all weekend
for the Wolverines, but Rumpel
continued to stand tall. At one
point, freshman forward JT
Compher jammed at the puck

several times at the left post to
no avail. The puck trickled into
the slot for senior forward Derek
DeBlois, who shot it directly
into Rumpel's pads. For one
final attempt, with the Wiscon-
sin defense gassed, Guptill fired

"It's frustrating when you're
throwing pucks to the net and
they don't go in," said senior
defenseman Mac Bennett.

is the weekend wasn't an iso-

freshmen this weekend, the play

of the upperclassmen becomes
more important and eventu-

In the competitive Big Ten,

Wisconsin all ranking in the top-

RIVALRY
From Page 1B
the beginning of December,
this weekend's contest had the
physicality of a rivalry game, the
talk of a rivalry game and the
atmosphere of a rivalry game.
But it was not. For it to be a
rivalry, Michigan would need to
have won.
The Wolverines would also
have to play Wisconsin regularly.
Because if there are two things
that have never been seen in
Michigan hockey, it's six men in
the penalty box and the Wolver-
ines and Wisconsin facing off in
the Big Ten conference.
Though these two teams first
faced each other 91years ago - on
Jan. 12, as a matter of fact - the
Badgers have not played a confer-
ence series against the Wolver-
ines since 1982 and last played in Juniorf
2010. Both teams certainly have softly:

Miami (Ohio).
A rivalry won't happen in the
blink of the eye, and a rivalry
won't change the fact that the
Wolverines are just two points
away from sitting fifth in the six-
team conference.
Even though it's unlikely
there will be six Badgers in the
Yost penalty box, will it become
a rivalry then? If there's a fight,

What will make this a rivalry?
It's a rivalry when the Wolver-
ines beat the Badgers with their
gloves on, not off.
It's a rivalry when Michigan
makes it a fight to the finish, not a
fight at the finish.
It's a rivalry when those same
six players show up on the score
sheet, not in the penalty box.

lose of reality: Wolverines slip up late

Second-half
comeback falls just
short in rivalry.
By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
It could have been the Michi-
gan women's basketball team's
statement win ina season full of
surprises. But the team fell just
short.
In MICHIGAN 72
what MICHIGAN ST. 79
could've
been a coming out party for the
Wolverines in front of a pom-
pom waving lower bowl, the
Spartans (3-0 Big Ten, 11-6 over-
all) played the role of spoiler.
Michigan left the Crisler Center
with the first blemish on its Big
Ten schedule.
The Wolverines (2-1, 11-5)
couldn't shake off early offen-
sive shortcomings produced by
Michigan State's smothering
defense en route to a 79-72 loss.
Though Michigan eliminated
the early deficit on the score-
board, the expended efforts of
the comeback prevented a sec-
ond one later.
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico said the stingy Spartan
defense took a physical toll on
the Wolverines, particularly the
guards.
"That wear and tear - (fresh-
man guard Siera Thompson)
played 40 minutes - really takes
atoll."
Michigan State took a 67-65
lead with 2:47 left when for-
ward Becca Mills made a jump-
er from the key. The Wolverines
responded with turnovers on
their next two possessions.
Mills extended the lead to 69-65
with just over a minute remain-
ing. After Smith missed wide on
a 3-pointer with the shot clock
expiring, the Spartans sealed
the game from the free-throw

the game.
The Wolverines fared much
better from the field in the sec-
ond half,, finding more qual-
ity shot opportunities after the
Spartans placed a more concert-
ed effort on stopping Michigan's
interior game.
The Wolverines shot 56.7 per-
cent from the field in the half,
including four-for-nine from
beyond the arc.
But even that wasn't enough
to earn a victory, because Michi-
gan State fared even better from
the field, knocking down 58.1
percent of their shots after the
break.
Thompson led the four Wol-
verines who scored in double
figures with 16 points. Goree led
the team with 10 rebounds in
the narrow defeat.
Though Michigan State came
away with the victory, Barnes
Arico is confident that the
Wolverines are on their way to
narrowing the traditional gap
between the two programs.
"I think tonight we showed
that we're right there," Barnes
Arico said.

For much of the first half,
Michigan could get little going
offensively, cloaked by a tight
Spartan defense. Forced to fre-
quently take unbalanced shots
as the shot clock wound down,
the Wolverines were down 26-17
with under four minutes left in
the half.
Then, Michigan's offensive
focus shifted. The Wolverines
needed to pound the ball inside
to create a comeback, and junior
forward Cyesha Goree was
the catalyst. Smothered by her
defender with five seconds left
on the shot clock late in the first
half, Goree advanced towards
the basket, taking it straight
at her defender. Even with the

Large crowd gets a show

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
With nearly two minutes left
in the first half of the Michigan
women's basketball game on
Sunday afternoon at Crisler Cen-
ter, junior forward Cyesha Goree
went on a 7-0 run, bringing the
Wolverines within two points of
Michigan State for the first time
all game.
The 4,510-person crowd
erupted at a decibel usually
reserved for the men's team. Sec-
onds later, freshman guard Siera
Thompson tied the game at 28
with one minute left before half.
It'scommonplacetosee alarge
amount of green and white in the
stands of any sporting event in
Ann Arbor that hosts the Spar-
tans. This fact stood true once
again, but the voices of the Spar-
tan fans couldn't hold a candle to
the roar of loyal Wolverine sup-
porters. Though Michigan fell
79-72, that fan presence made a
big impact and kept the team in
the game until the very end, even
if it isn't quantifiable.
"Anytime you can get a group
of people behind you, cheer-
ing for you, regardless of if they
think they hear it or not, they
get excited about it," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico. "I
know that Michigan State has
fans like this every single game,
so for us to be able to have that
support tonight means a tremen-
dous amount, and that's what we
are striving for night in and night

out."
While Michigan fans didn't
disappoint, it looked as though
the team might not give them a
worthy show early in the first
half. The Wolverines, who cur-
rently rank 14th in the nation in
field goal percentage, fell behind
quickly, going 5-for-18 in the first
13 minutes of play.
Michigan kept the Spartans
from gaining an insurmountable
lead in the early going, grabbing
a number of defensive rebounds
and hustling hard to keep posses-
sion of the ball. But at one point,
Michigan State led by nine. The
Wolverine faithful continued to
play its part, trying to fake out
the Spartans by counting down
their shot clock five seconds
early a number of times.
Goree singlehandedly kept
the Wolverines in the game at
the end of the first, and her team
returned the favor after half-
time. Michigan came out and
scored the first points of the sec-
ond half, and then held onto the
lead for almost four minutes.
Fans continued their efforts
into the second half, chant-
ing "Let's go blue," along with
the pep band, booing question-
able calls from the referees and
exploding with excitement after
alayup from Thompson or points
off a turnover for senior forward
Val Driscoll.
Even after the run by Goree,
scoring wasn't easy. The Spar-
tans' defense, continued to pile
on the pressure, limiting junior

guard Shannon Smith's produc-
tion. She was held to two points
and three assists in the first 30
minutes.
"Shannon is our scorer and as
a team when the game is on the
line, we always want the ball in
her hands," Barnes Arico said. "I
always feel like the next time she
has the ball in her hands, she can
make a play."
But Smith never got in a
groove. In fact, every Michigan
player had difficulty finishing
plays on offense. Most of the
Wolverine attempts came with
less than three seconds left on
the shot clock.
By the second half, those
attempts started turning in
points, but the Spartans' ability
to force Michigan to run the shot
clock down to get better looks on
offense gave Michigan State the
upper hand to win the game.
"We had to cut, and we were
doing a lot of standing around,"
Goree said. "Once we actually
ran our offense and got it mov-
ing I think we were able to create
shots for ourselves or get to the
rim and attack."
Though the Wolverines
couldn't come out on top, the
crowd was almost four times
the number that Goree and her
team are accustomed to at home
this year. And the increase in
attendance didn't go unnoticed.
Without question, Barnes
Arico says, everything they did
impacted the aggressiveness of
the Wolverines.
