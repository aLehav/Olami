The duality of the First 

Amendment as a powerful 
political weapon for both 
marginalized groups and their 
oppressors presented itself as 
a reality this past semester. 
The 
ongoing 
negotiation 

between the University of 
Michigan administration and 
white supremacist Richard 
Spencer regarding Spencer’s 
request 
to 
speak 
at 
the 

University, as well as planned 
University events in response 
to the speech, has roused 
divided opinions on campus.

While 
the 
University 

has not reached an official 

agreement with Spencer on 
when and where he will speak, 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel sent a statement 
on Jan. 5 welcoming the 
University community back to 
campus and announcing the 
administration’s commitment 
to 
providing 
a 
forum 
to 

discuss 
the 
challenge 
of 

balancing free speech while 
maintaining 
an 
inclusive 

community.

The Office of Diversity, 

Equity 
and 
Inclusion 

published 
the 
scheduled 

programming on their website 
for the series titled “Speech 
and Inclusion: Recognizing 
Conflict and Building Tools 
for Engagement.” The events 

Cities like Detroit and Flint 

have two options: Crisis or 
creative thinking. U.S. Rep. 
Dan Kildee, D-Flint, and John 
Gallagher, a business writer for 
the Detroit Free Press, hope for 
the latter.

Speaking to about 50 people 

at the University of Michigan’s 
School of Social Work Tuesday 
night, Kildee and Gallagher 
discussed civic revitalization 
efforts in a lecture, titled “How 
Place 
Matters: 
Perspectives 

on 
the 
Future 
of 
Urban 

Development in Detroit and 
Flint.” The talk focused on 
“shrinking cities,” metro areas 
in the Northeast and Midwest 
that were once industrial hubs 
but now suffer from population 
loss and economic decline.

“In the Michigan of the past, 

you turn 18, you walk down the 
street to the factory and you 
have a job for life,” Gallagher 
said. “That’s been gone for a long 
time. There’s no one solution 
like there used to be, where the 
automotive industry solves all 
our problems. Now you need 
better education, better public 
transit, better policy.”

Kildee, 
a 
Flint 
native 

who 
represents 
Michigan’s 

5th 
congressional 
district, 

recently founded The Future 
of America’s Cities and Towns, 

an initiative aimed at tackling 
issues facing older, industrial 
communities. He said it will 
call for a national strategy to 
address those issues.

“When I first got to Congress, 

I thought if I really worked 
hard, I would get maybe to be 
one of the many voices working 
on behalf of cities,” he said. “I 
got there and I realized I was 
at the front of the line. It really 
was not a subject that was being 

discussed much. That’s part of 
the problem generally.”

Flint used to be known as the 

birthplace of General Motors, 
and boomed into a company 
town where nearly everyone 
was in some way connected 
to the automotive industry. In 
its heyday, Flint was known as 
a hub for secure, good paying 
jobs.

But after General Motors 

moved plants and jobs overseas, 

the city’s tax base fell. Many 
blame GM for the city’s poverty 
— poverty that has opened the 
doors to issues like the Flint 
water crisis. Kildee said Flint is 
now forced to act as though it is 
bankrupt.

Nearly three years after lead 

contamination was discovered 
in 
Flint’s 
water 
supply 
in 

2014, 
the 
Environmental 

Protection Agency announced 

The University of Michigan’s 

Central 
Student 
Government 

convened Tuesday evening to 
discuss proposals to ensure the 
transparency of CSG, as well 
as help to fund university-wide 
career-building events for students. 
The 
meeting 
concluded 
with 

the passing of three resolutions, 
including the enactment of CSG’s 
winter 
2018 
budget, 
training 

to 
combat 
modern-day 
anti-

Semitism, and further revision of 
the election code.

The assembly hosted a guest 

speaker to promote increased 
student voter participation and 
turnout. Rackham student Alton 
Worthington 
in 
the 
Political 

Science Department, introduced 
members to Turn Up Turnout, a 
student group that aims to teach 
students at Michigan about the 
importance of voting in midterm 
and local elections. Worthington, 
the secretary of Turn Up Turnout, 
presented statistics to members, 
including the fact that less than 
half of students on campus vote in 
local elections.

Worthington encouraged CSG

Governor reflects on seven years in office in speech to joint legislative session

Gov. Rick Snyder delivered 

his eighth and final State of the 
State address to a joint session 
of the Michigan legislature 
Tuesday 
night. 
Prominent 

members of the Michigan state 

government, as well as scores of 
bureaucrats, law enforcement 
officials 
and 
journalists 

attended the address.

The address was broadly 

reflective of Snyder’s tenure 
as governor as he focused 
heavily on economic policy. 
He noted the state economy 
has grown since he took office 

and highlighted job growth 
as a particular strength for 
the state. He credited tax cuts 
enacted during his tenure for 
business success statewide.

“We, as a government, don’t 

create the jobs,” Snyder said. 
“We create the environment for 
success.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 24, 2018


When Dr. Sij Hemal, a 

University of Michigan alum, 
boarded a plane on Dec. 17 in 
Paris headed to New York, he 
planned to watch the thriller 
“Side Effects” while sipping 
a glass of champagne before 
dozing off.

But Hemal was unable to 

indulge in his plan due to an 
unexpected request from the 
flight attendant asking if any 
doctors were on board.

Hemal 
is 
a 
second-year 

urology resident at Cleveland 
Clinic’s Glickman Urological 

and 
Kidney 
Institute 
who 

received 
his 
undergraduate 

degree from the University of 
Michigan before attending the 
Wake Forest University School 
of Medicine.

A reflection of his “Leaders 

and the Best” roots, Hemal 
offered his assistance and soon 
discovered 
passenger 
Toyin 

Ogundipe had gone into labor 
35,000 feet up in the air off the 
southern coast of Greenland. 
Ogundipe’s delivery was the 
eighth delivery of his career.

“She was complaining of 

back pain,” Hemal told CNN. 
“At first, I thought it might be 
kidney stones, but after she told 
me she was pregnant, I knew 
she was going into labor.”

The crew considered making 

an emergency landing two 
hours outside the route at the 
U.S. military base in the Azores 
Islands, but ultimately the plane 
continued onward toward JFK 
International Airport.

Ogundipe was moved to first 

class and Hemal handled the 
delivery from start to finish 

with the assistance of crew 

members. An hour and a half 
later the plane had one extra 
passenger with the birth of 
Ogundipe’s son named Jake.

Ogundipe 
recounted 
how 

Hemal made her feel safe 
and applauded his efforts in 
an article published by The 
Cleveland Clinic.

“They 
did 
everything 
a 

doctor or midwife would have 
done if I was in the labor room 
in the hospital,” Ogundipe said. 
“Even better, if you ask me.”

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: GROUP PROTESTS ‘U’ RAPE POLICY

ON THE DAILY: BABIES ON A PLANE

Jan 22, 1985

By Stacy Shonk 
Daily Staff Reporter

Thirty students and Ann 

Arbor residents staged a sit-in 
at University Vice President 
for Student Services Henry 
Johnson’s 
office 
yesterday 

to protest remarks he made 
about rape in this month’s 
issue of Metropolitan Detroit 
Magazine.

In 
an 
article 
entitled 

“Silent Crime,” Johnson said 
the 
University 
downplays 

reports of rape on campus 
because it could hurt freshman 
enrollment.

“WE’RE NOT here to blame 

you for the problem of rape 
on campus,” said LSA junior 
Maureen 
Fitzsimmons 
to 

Johnson. “We’re here because 
we want to help ourselves, and 

we need your cooperation.”

The group entered Johnson’s 

office 
at 
9 
a.m. 
yesterday 

morning and stayed until 5 p.m.

Once inside, the protesters 

met 
with 
Johnson 
and 

presented their demands for 
dealing with sexual assaults on 
campus.

“I WAS raped twice on 

campus, and I had nowhere 
to go,” said one woman as she 
stared at Johnson. 

“Sometimes I feel like a 

neurotic, 
paranoid 
woman 

who 
goes 
around 
talking 

about things people don’t want 
to hear,” said Anne Ryan, a 
graduate student, “but I know 
hundreds 
of 
other 
women 

... who are afraid to walk on 
campus.”

Johnson 
defended 
his 

remarks saying they were taken 
out of context. He called the 
story “deplorable journalism,” 

but 
said 
talking 
about 
it 

wouldn’t solve the problem. 
Johnson handed out copies of a 
letter he sent to the magazine.

“WE TAKE strong exception 

to the very biased ‘Silent Crime’ 
article in your January issue,” 
the letter read. “To say that 
U-M administrators are lax 
in dealing with sex offenses is 
simply not true.”

One of the problems in 

implementing rape prevention 
programs, Johnson said, is that 
two-thirds of students live in 
off-campus housing which is 
outside 
University 
security 

jurisdiction.

One protester suggested that 

the reason the administration 
does not perceive the magnitude 
of the rape issue is because they 
lack accurate statistics.

ONLY 
TWO 
first-degree 

rapes were reported directly 
to 
University 
security 
last 

year. Only rapes committed 
against students on campus 
are reported according to Walt 
Stevens, director of security.

One 
of 
the 
protester’s 

demands focused on the lack 
of adequate security patrols on 
campus. A large security staff 
protects University buildings, 
but only four guards patrol 
outside, accor-

ding to Stevens.

Other 
demands 
included 

better lighting of residential 
areas, more rapid repair of 
existing lighting fixtures, and 
an outdoor emergency phone 
system.

WHILE the group talked 

about 
the 
problem 
with 

Johnson, one member made 
a list of his promises on a 
chalkboard in the conference 
room.

The list said, “Vice President 

Henry Johnson will:

• 
make a comprehensive 

list of services within the 
University.

• 
look 
at 
Michigan 

State University, Ohio State 
University, 
and 
Cornell 

University as possible models to 
improve Michigan’s programs.

• 
find 
a 
dedicated 

phone line for women to share 
experiences 
and 
incidences 

common to women.

• 
explore 
possibility 

of free self-defense courses in 
dorms and other locations.

• 
access to Computing 

Centers for women.

• 
review all literature 

in Student Services to insure 
that it treats violence against 
women as a community problem 
and not a problem restricted to 
women.”

The long-term goals of the 

organization include a crisis 
center which deals with sexual 
harassment of all types.

International Bridge and was 
present at the address. The 
bridge, to be completed in 
2022, will connect Detroit 
with Windsor, Ontario. 

Snyder also briefly spoke 

about the opioid crisis in 
Michigan, 
commending 

a 
popular 
program 
that 

allows addicts to approach 
law 
enforcement 
officers 

for rehabilitation resources 
without fear of arrest or 
prosecution. He also noted 
that 
the 
state’s 
prison 

population has fallen below 
40,000 for the first time since 
1993.

While he mostly focused 

on the successes of the state 
under 
his 
stewardship, 

Snyder conceded that changes 
lawmakers made to the state 
recycling program were one 
of the biggest failures of his 
administration.

Throughout 
the 
speech, 

Snyder 
offered 
several 

critiques 
of 
contemporary 

political culture. As a fiscal 
conservative, 
he 
criticized 

those 
who 
advocate 
for 

unfunded tax cuts. This may 

have been a veiled rebuke of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
Republicans’ signature federal 
legislative 
achievement 

during the last year. The bill, 
which was signed into law by 
President Trump on Dec. 22, 
is projected to add $1.5 trillion 
to the national debt over the 
next decade.

However, 
Snyder 
was 

likely referring to the tax cut 
currently being enacted by 
the state legislature, where 
both chambers overrode his 
veto six days ago. Though he 
was attempting to keep the 
state budget balanced, state 
Republicans showed a united 
front, passing the further 
cut unanimously in the state 
Senate and with a sizeable 
majority in the state House — 
much to the chagrin of fiscal 
conservatives like Snyder.

“Being fiscally responsible 

is more than just balancing 
budgets,” Snyder said. “It’s 
not thinking about us today, 
but our children and future 
generations.”

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 

D-Ann Arbor, voted against 
the tax cut and the override 
but said he empathized with 
his 
Republican 
colleagues. 

He opposed the cut primarily 
because he wants to see 

increase in state funding 

for public education.

“I had to balance that with 

the need for good quality 
public education for everyone 
in the state, which I think is a 
great benefit to working class 
Michiganders,” Rabhi said.

State Rep. Lee Chatfield, 

R-Cheboygan, 
the 
Speaker 

Pro Tempore of the Michigan 
House, expressed faith in 
Gov. Snyder and the work of 
the Republican Conference 
during his tenure.

“I think Governor Snyder 

did an excellent job detailing 
the growth and comeback 
our state has had over the last 
seven years,” Chatfield said. 
“He’s really charted a nice 
path for us. Moving forward, 
our focus needs to be on 
improving skilled trades and 
making sure that we have a 
skilled workforce ready to 
take jobs that are available in 
our state.”

The speech was not so 

well received by Michigan 
Democrats. Rabhi felt the 
governor’s 
characterization 

of 
the 
state’s 
well 
being 

was inaccurate and that his 
optimistic tone was misplaced.

“I think that the governor 

painted a very rosy picture 
of the state of affairs in 

Michigan,” 
Rabhi 
said. 

“I would argue that the 
state has so much more 
that it needs to do, and we 
have unfortunately gone 
backward in some key 
areas.”

Rabhi 
specifically 

criticized 
Snyder’s 

policies relating to road 
and water infrastructure, 
the 
Flint 
water 
crisis 

and 
providing 
internet 

and other key services 
to 
Michigan 
residents, 

among other policy areas. 
In his view, the state’s 
economic growth over the 
last seven years has come 
at a significant cost; public 
funding has been cut in a 
number of areas.

Snyder spent little time 

on policy details during the 
speech, preferring to focus 
on big-picture reflections 
and 
accomplishments. 

One 
of 
the 
unifying 

themes 
of 
his 
address 

was family. He used the 
word to describe an ideal 
political 
world, 
where 

each member is willing 

to work cooperatively with 
the others and avoid hardline 
partisanship. To this end, 
Snyder 
also 
criticized 

politicians 
nationwide 
for 

engaging 
in 
ruthless 
and 

unproductive 
partisan 

competition.

“I believe the greatest threat 

to the future of our nation is 
ourselves ... If we can’t get 
along with ourselves, how can 
we be great?” Snyder said. “If 
you hear someone running 
for political office talk about 
‘fighting,’ 
the 
red 
lights 

should start flashing. Who are 
we fighting? Ourselves.”

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Larry Nasser is escorted to his seat during his sentencing hearing in the Ingham County Courthouse in Lansing Tuesday.

are slated to begin in February 
and continue throughout the 
winter semester. The DEI office 
has organized these events in 
collaboration with the Office 
of the President, The National 
Center 
for 
Institutional 

Diversity, the Office of Student 
Life, The Alumni Association, 
Wallace House and the Office 
of Academic Innovation. There 
are 
also 
plans 
to 
broaden 

the 
organizations 
involved 

and 
expand 
the 
schedule 

throughout the semester.

Thus 
far, 
the 
scheduled 

events include several virtual 
teach-outs hosted online by the 
Office of Academic Innovation, 
one teach-in, lectures from 
New York Times columnist Bret 
Stephens and NPR host Joshua 
Johnson, as well as a panel 
discussion 
featuring 
higher 

education leaders. 

Mike 
Morland, 
marketing 

and communications manager 
for the DEI office, explained 
the goals behind these planned 
events and what the University 
ultimately hopes for the series 
to achieve.

“The series is aiming to 

recognize the differing views 
on speech and inclusion, so to 
explore the views that play out 
in politics, in culture, higher 
education and many other parts 

of our lives,” Morland said. 
“So by engaging in productive 
conversations with individuals 
that have varying views and 
perspectives, we are hoping 
our community will be able 
to come away from this series 
with a deeper understanding 
of issues like these that are 
very complicated and a better 
understanding of one another.”

While the DEI office has 

alluded to more programming 
in 
the 
future, 
the 
initial 

lineup of events has elicited 
frustration 
among 
students 

and faculty concerned with 
the 
administration’s 
choice 

to anchor discussion in free 
speech and inclusion.

Michigan 
Mellon 
Fellow 

Austin McCoy believes the free 
speech and inclusion series does 
not adequately rebuke Spencer’s 
racial dogma. To McCoy, the 
series suggests the University 
is employing the canon of free 
speech as a “Trojan horse” to 
avoid 
addressing 
Spencer’s 

white supremacist philosophies 
candidly.

“It would be better if there 

were 
actual 
conversations 

about 
the 
resurgence 
of 

white supremacists or white 
nationalist politics and what 
that 
means 
for 
political 

culture, but also having a 
frank 
conversation 
about 

the intentions of people like 
Richard Spencer,” McCoy said.

The 
belief 
that 
the 

administration 
is 
defaulting 

on a backbone of free speech 
and 
inclusion 
as 
opposed 

to 
challenging 
the 
white 

supremacist beliefs espoused by 
Spencer, is a criticism echoed 
across campus.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

History lecturer Anne Berg 
explained her own concerns 
regarding the message ascribed 
to the word “inclusion.” Berg 
noted it is unclear whether 
the use of the word inclusion 
implies 
the 
inclusion 
of 

minorities or expands to mean 
the inclusion of neo-Nazis.

According 
to 
Berg, 
this 

ambiguous use of the word 
undermines the integrity of the 
University’s DEI efforts.

“The choice to label the series 

‘Free Speech and Inclusion’ 
is not only complicit with the 
framing 
imposed 
by 
right-

wing agitators, but also risks 
to undermine the important 
efforts to make our campus a 
more equitable place where we 
confront white supremacy head 
on and don’t just throw around 
empty, 
sanitized 
language 

that allows us to celebrate an 
increasingly 
hollow-sounding 

concept of ‘inclusion,’” she said.

The notion of uniting the 

collective voice of a higher 
education population to yield 
change 
is 
an 
idea 
whose 

birthplace is quite present on 
the Diag at the University of 
Michigan. Within the cradle 
of 
progressive 
Ann 
Arbor, 

the 
University’s 
history 
is 

chronicled with displays of 
students and faculty defending 
the values of the institution.

This 
touchstone 
of 
the 

University 
has 
not 
been 

forgotten by those students and 
faculty who are unsatisfied with 
the University’s response in the 
“Free Speech and Inclusion 
Series.” The fact that the Free 
Speech and Inclusion series is 
the first formal announcement 
of programming sponsored by 
the administration to address 
the 
tensions 
that 
became 

grounded last semester has 
also left students and faculty 
questioning 
the 
intentions 

behind the series.

Berg 
explained 
how 
the 

framing of the University’s 
response thus far to Spencer 
lends 
itself 
to 
a 
critical 

examination 
of 
possible 

external influences.

“Having 
the 
series 
on 

‘Speech 
and 
Inclusion’ 

now strikes me as a rather 
pathetic attempt to provide 
retroactive 
justification 
for 

letting lawyers and the pocket 
books of existing or potential 
donors dictate the university’s 
response to the resurgence 
of white supremacists in the 
public 
sphere 
rather 
than 

listening to the voices of a 
concerned campus community 
and to historically informed 
scholarly arguments against 
downplaying the violent threat 
inherent in white supremacist 
platforms,” Berg said.

McCoy similarly called for 

the University to be clearer 
when designing programming 
in response to the violent 
rhetoric ingrained in Spencer’s 
agenda.

“The University seems to 

be 
more 
concerned 
about 

protecting 
itself 
from 
any 

sort of legal harm than it does 
with actually issuing a very 
sharp and critical stance that 
acknowledges what they are 
trying to do politically,” McCoy 
said.

In a similar manner, in an 

earlier interview with the Daily, 
Art & Design freshman Betsy 
Stubb reflected on the need for 
more 
transparency 
between 

students and administration 
regarding Spencer’s impending 
speech.

“I 
knew 
very 
little 

information 
about 
Richard 

Spencer’s appearance because 
administration 
has 
been 

keeping students in the dark,” 
she said. “I think the best 
way we can combat the hate 
and 
violence 
that 
Spencer 

spreads is for all of us to rally 
together and show that racism 
and bigotry are not acceptable 
at U of M. We need to help 
foster an environment where 
students of all races, religions 
and sexualities feel safe and 
protected, because under the 
current administration this is 
not the case.”

However, the DEI office has 

emphasized the series will not 

be the only action taken by the 
administration to tackle the 
threats last semester posed to 
the University’s values.

“This isn’t designed to be 

the singular answer to it. It 
is part of that larger complex 
of the challenges we face as a 
community,” Morland said.

Yet, those involved in the 

#StopSpencer coalition believe 
the University’s track record 
when addressing the pending 
Spencer visit warrants the need 
for the movement to continue to 
pressure the administration.

LSA 
senior 
Hoai 
An 

Pham is an organizer in the 
#StopSpencer 
coalition 
and 

described in an email interview 
how the administration has 
missed opportunities to frame 
the Spencer visit in a manner 
that 
recognizes 
the 
fears 

of 
marginalized 
groups 
on 

campus.

“We 
would 
like 
the 

University 
to 
acknowledge 

the ways in which it has been 
complicit in propagating white 
supremacy and racism, starting 
with their lack of qualifications 
to host a series on free speech 
when they are allowing a white 
supremacist to come to campus 
to endanger our community 
and take away the free speech 
and fundamental human rights 
of marginalized people,” Pham 
wrote.

it would award a $100 million 
emergency 
grant 
to 
the 

state to fund infrastructure 
repairs. When Detroit filed for 
Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2013, 
philanthropic donations saved 
the city-owned art collection 
at the Detroit Institute of Arts 
while a $195 million legislative 
package from Lansing helped 
minimize 
pension 
cuts 
for 

retirees. Kildee believes state 
and federal government should 
play a more proactive role 
when it comes to maintaining 
shrinking cities in the Rust Belt.

“Flint is the ultimate case 

study,” Kildee said. “Here’s 
a frightening thought: there 
are dozens — if not more — 
cities that are one mistake, one 
miscalculation, one error away 
from going to the same place 
Flint was in with the water crisis. 
They’re just barely hanging on. 
We can’t let those places get 
there.”

Kildee 
and 
Gallagher 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of public policy in ensuring 
a successful future for aging 
industrial centers.

“The 
narrative 
that 
you 

hear that cities like Detroit and 
Pittsburgh and Leipzig and 
Turin are coming back, that is 
to some extent true, but we are 
in the very early stages of this,” 
Gallagher said. “We need to 
provide some better political 
balance, so that cities are not left 
out on their own.”

Gallagher pointed to limited 

public services, an increasingly 
poor population and holes in the 

social safety net as symptoms of 
Detroit and Flint’s difficulties 
coping with the boom and bust 
of the automotive industry. He 
also acknowledged the value of 
community development groups 
like Midtown Detroit Inc. and 
the Southwest Detroit Business 
Association, with the stipulation 
that these organizations need 
more help from city hall.

Gallagher 
also 
discussed 

Detroit’s downtown area. While 
it is currently being lauded for its 
recent growth, the downtown 
area alone doesn’t paint a full 
economic picture. He said in 
reality, there are two different 
Detroits.

“Downtown is doing great 

and the neighborhoods are doing 
terribly,” Gallagher said. “There 
are still two-thirds of the city 
who are still awaiting any kind 
of good stuff.”

These portions of the city 

require major help, and luckily, 
he said through community 
development 
groups 
and 

philanthropy, some of this help is 
being offered. From the Detroit 
Institute of Arts to the Eastern 
Market to the Cobo Center, 
he said taking things from the 
city government’s hands and 
into the hands of non-profit 
management.

“I think philanthropy has 

played a huge role in Detroit … 
Entrepreneurship is beginning 
to play a role.”

But for all of the help being 

offered, Gallagher said an eye 
must be kept on gentrification. 
While 
modernization 
and 

aesthetics have been important 
to the growth of the downtown 
area, 
he 
said 
policymakers 

must be wary of kicking out the 
citizens who have “stuck it out” 

through economic hardship. He 
said the best way to do this is 
through inclusion of affordable 
housing.

“In the large scope, we 

really hope for new interest 
in investment … But we need 
to 
work 
against 
that 
new 

investment pushing out the 
people who were left behind and 
who tend to be more poor.”

Another 
effective 
tool 
in 

combating blight is the land 
bank. The Detroit Land Bank 
Authority oversees about 95,000 
properties and has demolished 
nearly 13,000 blighted homes 
since May 2014.

When 
Kildee 
served 
as 

Genesee County Treasurer, he 
helped establish Michigan’s first 
land bank, a public authority 
for acquiring and repurposing 
vacant and distressed properties. 
He said the consequences of 
such dilapidation hit the people 
who live there hardest.

“It’s 
not 
just 
about 
the 

aesthetic of the community 
kids grow up in,” Kildee said. 
“Their lives are forever changed 
growing up in a poor place like 
that, and that’s a result of policy 
choices that we’ve made. This 
idea that somehow it’s OK that 
there’s 50 American cities that 
have lost half of their population 
in the last few decades and are 
really struggling to just stay 
above water, that that’s OK is a 
morally bankrupt thought.”

The 
School 
of 
Social 

Work’s Learning Community 
on 
Poverty 
and 
Inequality 

presented the talk, which also 
constituted the first class session 
of the minicourse Poverty and 
Place: Case Studies of Detroit 
and Flint. Social Work student 
Lindsay Hall, who was in the 

audience, noted that intersecting 
factors like location, available 
resources and demographics can 
influence urban development, 
but said funding is particularly 
important.

“Ultimately it really goes back 

to the money, where the money 
is and who the money goes to,” 
she said. “Public policy really 
defines those terms. Policies 
that pay attention to the nuances 
of a city and level the playing 
field for cities like Flint and 
Detroit and put them on an even 
starting block with the more 
affluent suburbs can make a real 
difference.”

Erica Davenport, who works 

in a southwest Detroit school 
and also attended the talk, said 
though she’s only lived in Detroit 
for a year, she has amounted 
large frustrations towards the 
way money is allocated. Still, she 
said Kildee’s knowledge gave her 
important perspective.

“I get pretty skeptical about 

things,” Davenport said. “His 
perspective from Flint gave 
behind the scenes reality to how 
we can make change in schools.”

Throughout the talk, Kildee 

repeatedly 
highlighted 
the 

imperative to maintain older 
metropolitan communities.

“Cities matter,” Kildee said. 

“Cities are more important. 
Creativity, 
innovation 
and 

ingenuity happen where people 
live and work in proximity to 
one another. One of the essential 
functions of government is to 
sustain those places in the ebb 
and flow of economic changes 
because we know those places 
are going to be important to 
us again. Right now we don’t 
believe that. These are throw 
away places.”

urges students to register to vote 
and ultimately show up on Election 
Day. Organizations that can reach a 
larger student population, such as 
CSG, will help to increase overall 
turnout in student voters. While 
working with the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge, 
which 
incentivizes 

students who register to vote, Turn 
Up Turnout has a clear mission for 
their organization.

“We need to encourage students 

to recognize that civic engagement, 
when it comes to voting, is an 
important part of their participation 
in society,” Worthington said. 
“Students can use their voice, not 
just on campus.”

Following the guest speaker, CSG 

President Anushka Sarkar, an LSA 
senior, announced the beginning of 
a collaboration with other student 
leaders to plan a unity rally in 
February before Spring Break. This 
event is planned to counter the 
efforts being made to allow Richard 
Spencer to speak on Michigan’s 
campus, which has been a topic of 
much debate since October.

CSG Vice President Nadine 

Jawad, a Public Policy senior, 
addressed the finalizing of the 
campus affordability guide, in 
which she emphasized the guide’s 
importance to students and other 
Big Ten universities’ hopes to 
replicate the guide.

“I think this is a really useful 

resource 
because 
it’s 
on 
our 

campus,” Jawad said. “Schools 
reached out and said (the guide) was 
incredible.”

A resolution was proposed to help 

fund the Career Center’s “Suit Up” 
event, particularly transportation 
from campus to JCPenney at 
Briarwood 
Mall. 
JCPenney 

partnered with the University to 
offer up to a 70 percent discount 
on professional wear for students. 
With the event’s success in October, 
plans to host another “Suit Up” 
event in February are underway. 
Public Health senior Lloyd Lyons 
presented the resolution to the 
assembly 
and 
highlighted 
the 

event’s benefits to students who 
may be seeking job or internship 
opportunities.

“As career fair time is coming 

up, this is going to be a huge event 
for students to get some clothing,” 
Lyons said.

Public Health graduate student 
Dana Greene also knelt in the Diag 
last semester to protest anti-Black 
racism, and a month later, several 
Ann Arbor city councilmembers 
knelt 
during 
the 
pledge 
of 

allegience at a council meeting in 
solidiarity with people of color. 

“We are living in a moment in 

which culture is high stakes and we 
as humanists can help understand 
these human ways,” Dillard said.

The panelists each introduced 

how their field of study aligns with 
the topic of kneeling during the 
national anthem. The patriotism 
ensued from sports allows sports, 
especially football, to transcend 
the world of sports into the world 
of politics.

Kristin 
Hass, 
associate 

professor in the Department of 
American Culture, who specializes 
in war, war memorials and soldiers, 
discussed 
the 
importance 
of 

United States military power and 
its relationship to patriotism.

“Nations 
are 
produced 
by 

culture,” Hass said. “Nations are 
the primary social organization for 
the 20th and 21st century and part 
of the 19th century. Almost always 
that culture is connected to soldiers 
and to sacrifice and to grief.”

Hass discussed how symbols 

of patriotism transform during 
times of instability, specifically 
instability of race. She referenced 
the role of the military as a form of 
patriotism. Since the Vietnam War, 
military service has been strictly 
volunteer-based. 
This 
change 

has led the government to find 
strategies to enhance patriotism in 
America in other ways.

“The United States government 

and the Department of Defense has 
been working very hard trying to 
find different strategy to change 
ways the people of the United 
States feel about war,” Hass said. 
“Since 2012, the Department of 
Defense has spent at least $10 
million on paying teams to do 
specific on-field demonstrations of 
patriotism.”

In a discussion on the link 

between athletics and patriotism, 
Associate Professor of Musicology 
Mark 
Clague 
analyzed 
the 

foundations of “The Star-Spangled 
Banner.” Following its creation by 
Francis Scott Key, the anthem was 
first played at a baseball game in 
1862.

“Professional sports had figured 

out that attaching themselves to 
patriotism was good for business,” 
Clague said. “(NFL Commissioner) 
promised (Truman) that they 
would play “The Star-Spangled 
Banner” at every game forward.”

Matthew 
Countryman, 

associate 
professor 
in 
the 

Department 
of 
History 
and 

Department of American Culture, 
discussed how President Trump 
vocalized the issue of kneeling 
during the national anthem. He 
referenced the athletic and political 
intersection 
seen 
in 
athletes 

throughout history including Jesse 
Owens and Muhammad Ali.

“Trump is, if nothing else, 

a brilliant vocalizer of a set of 
political concerns. I want to 
suggest here that he saw it as a 
political advantage to intervene 
to give voice to one source of the 
resentment,” Countryman said.

Given the high amount of 

time 
CSG 
representatives 

dedicate 
toward 
serving 

their 
student 
constituents, 

the desire for compensation 
is 
legitimate. 
However, 

monetary 
compensation 

for CSG members, whether 
through University funding 
or a tuition waiver, is not 
equitable to the leaders of 
thousands of other student 
organizations 
who 
invest 

equally significant time into 
their organizations. Sponsored 
Student 
Organizations 
are 

barred 
from 
paying 
their 

members due to University 
regulations on the allocation 
of 
student 
organization 

funding. This, despite the 
fact that for students who 
need to take a job while 
in 
school, 
uncompensated 

extracurricular 
leadership 

may 
put 
valuable 

opportunities out of reach.

While 
CSG 
may 
exist 

outside SSO policy — it relies 
primarily on a student fee 
of $9.19 per semester for its 
$800,000 annual budget — it 
should not view itself as more 
valuable to the University and 
its leaders more deserving of 
compensation 
than 
others. 
 

Directing public funds into 
financial 
compensation 
for 

the 
CSG 
executive 
board 

would, 
therefore, 
place 
a 

greater financial burden on all 
students, with an inequitable 
benefit for only CSG. As the 
LSA 
Student 
Government 

noted in a statement against 
the 
CSG 
proposal, 
“The 

opinion of the body (CSG) is 
… that involvement in CSG is 
more important than any of 
the other 1,400 plus student 
organizations on campus.”

CSG’s unique role as the 

representative body of the 
entire campus does bolster 
the argument for member 
compensation. 
However, 

CSG’s current makeup falls 
short of accurately reflecting 
the 
University’s 
student 

body 
with 
24.5 
percent 

of the 2016 entering class 
coming 
from 
households 

that make $250,000 or more 
annually. According to the 
Central Student Government 

Demographic 
Report, 

approximately 37.2 percent 
of CSG members come from 
households 
that 
bring 
in 

$250,000 or more annually. 
This socioeconomic disparity 
between 
CSG 
and 
the 

University as a whole reflects 
the barriers to membership 
confronted by students of low 

socioeconomic status.

Although 
financial 

compensation is meant to 
increase 
accessibility 
for 

students of lesser means, we 
are concerned that Sarkar 
has suggested modifying the 
proposal to only compensate 
executive 
board 
members. 

Here, the proposal falls short 
in its mission to increase 
CSG’s accessibility to students 
whose participation may have 
previously been financially 
impossible by only providing 
compensation 
for 
a 
select 

number of students. Seeing as 
the majority of the executive 
board is comprised of non-
elected students, there is also 
no guarantee that monetary 
compensation will not further 
exacerbate this barrier by 
serving 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 

nepotism, promoting students 
with similar backgrounds as 
existing representatives.

In addition, the lack of 

participation 
in 
elections 

undermines CSG’s legitimacy 
as 
a 
body 
deserving 
of 

outsized compensation. Only 
17.9 percent of students voted 
in the 2017 CSG election, 
reflecting low mobilization 
on the part of the student 
body. This is not to say that 
CSG does not work in the 

best interests of students, but 
rather that most students may 
not be wholly aware of CSG 
and its important duties.

Members 
could 
perhaps 

attempt to better fund the 
Leadership 
Engagement 

Scholarship, a program created 
by CSG last year in an effort to 
compensate student leaders 
for unpaid hours involved 
with 
their 
extracurricular 

commitments. 
This 
would 

give all students, regardless 
of financial need, the ability 
to 
become 
more 
involved 

without 
emphasizing 
the 

value of any one organization 
over another. While previous 
efforts by CSG to fund the 
scholarship 
through 
a 
$5 

increase 
to 
student 
fees 

aroused opposition, we would 
hope that the discussions of 
funding mechanisms for CSG 
compensation 
could 
easily 

be extended to scholarship 
funding. 
Clearly, 
better 

outlets for extra funds are not 
impossible to find.

Other 
initiatives 
for 

addressing 
the 
executive 

board’s 
concerns 
exist 

such 
as 
academic 
credit 

compensation. Even though 
newer members of CSG are 
able to partake while taking 
full course loads, executive 
members 
often 
take 
on 

minimal credit commitments 
due 
to 
the 
longer 
hours 

needed for their positions. 
Similar 
credit 
compensation 

options exist for internship and 
research programs, and we can 
see how CSG experiences could 
provide 
similar 
educational 

opportunities.

We 
understand 
the 

reasoning 
and 
motivations 

behind 
CSG’s 
most 
recent 

efforts to secure compensation 
for their time, effort and 
dedication. 
However, 
the 

issues that may arise from 
monetary 
compensation, 

and, further, compensation 
for 
only 
the 
executive 

board, would place unequal 
value on CSG as a student 
organization 
compared 

to the hundreds of other 
student groups and leaders 
on campus. 

CSG should pursue compensation for all student leaders

O

n the morning of Nov. 9, 
2016, my high school was 
drowned in grief. Teachers 

hugged 
distraught 

students, 
classes 

were canceled and an 
atmosphere 
of 
defeat 

filled the hallways.

Donald Trump was to 

be the next President of 
the United States, and my 
small liberal high school 
was in mourning.

In 
contrast 
with 

many of my peers, I was 
furious. I didn’t feel 
sadness, but rather anger at the 
hopelessness of the situation. I was 
17, on the brink of actual political 
influence, and yet I could not truly 
voice my opinion. Yes, I could make 
an impact through protest, writing 
Facebook posts and encouraging 
classroom discourse, but I could 
not physically sign a ballot. Young 
people need to be allowed to vote 
earlier, and we deserve to have 
influence in a political world that 
affects us directly.

In the United States, the voting 

age is 18. This is rarely questioned, 
as most people are in agreement 
that anyone younger than 18 is 
too immature and uninformed to 
actually vote consciously. They 
argue that 16-year-olds are naive 
and distracted; that they are 
more concerned with high school 
dramas than foreign policy or 
healthcare initiatives.

This, 
however, 
is 
a 
great 

misconception. In fact, through my 
own experience, I know that young 
people are politically conscious 
and eager to influence change. The 
issue arises in their motivation to 
vote. Millennials are known to have 
low voter turnout rates; about 50 
percent of eligible youth, ages 18-29, 
voted in the 2016 election. This is an 
increase from the 2012 election, in 
which 45 percent of millennials 
voted. However, these low rates 
do not directly translate into 
indifference. This is a product of 
their education and the stigmas 
around youth voters.

Firstly, voting is not seen as a 

privilege anymore but rather a 
bland assignment that takes time, 
effort and can be confusing. Low 
voter turnout can be credited to 
misinformed youth. There is little 
taught in schools that inspire 
students to exercise their right. I 
made the observation that in high 

school, classes like AP History 
rushed students through facts, 
so students focused more on 

memorization 
than 

actually 
learning 

about politics. In fact, 
in 2010 one-third of 
high school seniors 
don’t 
understand 

the basics of how the 
American government 
functions, the effect of 
media on politics and 
how 
international 

politics affect the U.S. 
I remember that as a 

16-year-old, I felt outraged at certain 
political decisions, but my passion 
was misguided. I had political 
stances that were aggressive but 
uncited. It wasn’t until my freshman 
year of college when I received 
in-depth schooling on these issues, 
that suddenly, I found nuance and 
direction in my ideals.

If the voting age is lowered, 

schools will have to discard surface-
level history lessons and implement 
dynamic, 
relevant 
coursework. 

This will likely spark interest, and 
more students will go to the polls. 
It’s like any learned skill: The earlier 
one starts playing an instrument or 
speaking a language, the more likely 
they are to stick with it, be good at 
it and love it. High school political 
curriculum simply needs to become 
more complex; after this, the 
responsibility will lay in the hands of 
the youth.

This lack of trust of the youth’s 

political potential is not only 
discouraging but unfair. What 
is decided in elections greatly 
impacts millennials. For example, 
the 
2016 
election 
determined 

which president would hold office 
for the next four years; it happens 
that those four years constitute my 
undergraduate education. Donald 
Trump’s presidency will directly 
impact me as a college student; that 
is, he will make decisions regarding 
education that will affect my life, but 
I have no say in it.

It is unjust that people on the 

cusp of adulthood cannot have a 
say in the laws and leadership that 
will influence their lives. My high 
school, whose student body was 
devastated after Trump’s election, 
became active in campaigning for 
candidates; ninth graders would 
attend Bernie Sanders rallies and 
a group of sophomores started 
a Young Democrats club. This is 

not just an Ann Arbor liberalist 
phenomenon; 
it 
demonstrates 

that young people care about their 
future and will do whatever they 
can to influence it. For example, 
in Portland, Oregon, hundreds of 
students from more than three 
different 
schools 
marched 
to 

Portland City Hall in anti-Trump 
protests, and there have been many 
more nationwide demonstrations 
led by adolescents regarding a 
variety of political issues. These 
are simple, yet crucial examples of 
participation young people have 
in politics and how it is unfair that 
they cannot apply their sentiments 
to voting.

Additionally, 
young 
people 

feel like their voice, or vote, is 
insignificant. “One vote is never 
going to be the difference,” LSA 
freshman Arturo Perez stated 
dejectedly. “Elections aren’t decided 
by one vote.”

This mentality is dangerous, as 

it discourages youth from voting: 
Why should they make the effort 
to register, drive to the polls, wait in 
line, etc., if what they say isn’t heard? 
It’s not that millennials are lazy, they 
just don’t understand the importance 
of their voice. The process of 
registering to vote, especially if they 
are away for college, can appear 
tedious and after no reward. This 
misconception is dangerous and 
can be quelled through inspiring 
education; if these students feel they 
have a responsibility, if the nation 
entrusts them, they will combat this 
“laziness” and voter turnout will 
skyrocket.

Former 
Chilean 
President 

Salvador Allende once said: “Ser 
joven y no ser revolucionario es una 
contradicción hasta biológica.” In 
English, this translatees to: “To be 
young and not a revolutionary is 
a biological contradiction.” These 
words, however aggressive, hold an 
important message. Young people 
are arguably the most influential 
members of society, and politics 
affect us greatly. If we lower 
the voting age, the youth will 
realize their power and utilize 
it. Millennial voter turnout will 
increase, political consciousness 
will expand and we will gain access 
to the brainpower of a sometimes 
hidden, but always stirring, subset 
of our nation: the youth.

The need for a younger voting age

“

Can 
we 
please 
watch 

anything else?” I implored 
my mother as I sat down 

for my after-school snack while 
secretly hoping she wouldn’t 
acquiesce to my demand. My bus 
dropped me off every day just 
in time for “The Oprah Winfrey 
Show” to come on at 4:00 p.m., 
and I had grown very fond of the 
woman who seemed to ooze 
charisma even through the TV 
screen. Oprah became a part of 
our families; she was our mom, 
sister, daughter and aunt all at 
the same time. She reminded 
us of this infectious personality 
with 
her 
monumental 
and 

empowering speech last week 
at the Golden Globe Awards. 
Seemingly instantaneously after 
the speech started, an all-too-
familiar call to action resurfaced: 
“Oprah for president.”

I understand the appeal. I 

really do. In many ways she is the 
opposite of President Trump so 
many of us crave; she is soft when 
he is abrasive, generous where he 
is stingy and likable while he’s 
laughable. However, I cannot 
in good conscience endorse her 
for president.

Her 
candidacy 
would 

fundamentally lessen what it 
means to be president of this great 
country. It is a slap in the face to 
so many who dedicate their lives 
to just have the chance to be in a 
position to lift up a nation. What 
does it say to John McCain, a war 
hero and lifetime civil servant, if 
Oprah wins and he didn’t? What 
does it say if we elect the second 
person in a row with no political 
experience or related educational 
background (a vast majority of 
presidents since the beginning of 
the 20th century have law degrees 
or advanced degrees in business 
and economics)? In a time where 
we wouldn’t hire an electrician 
in our homes without thoroughly 
reading their reviews and making 
sure they have the requisite 
training, 
it 
seems 
absolutely 

insane that we would be willing to 

give the hardest job on the planet 
without any record of how they 
would act in such an environment.

This past week, I learned about 

electoral politics in the developing 
world, the weaknesses of different 
times of autocracies and even 
the legal responsibilities of the 
president. As I sat in these classes 
and heard my peers discuss checks 
to presidential power, I couldn’t 
help but let my mind wander to the 
proposition of Oprah for president. 
Just by being an upperclassmen 
majoring in political science, we 
probably have more of a baseline 
of knowledge for the job than 
Oprah does. Having interned 
for 
various 
campaigns 
and 

political organizations, I have 
seen countless people who have 
foregone more lucrative career 
paths to start on a path of public 
service. Oprah didn’t do that. You 
don’t become a billionaire by 
sacrificing your life to public 
service. There is a very real 
difference between being a 
good person and being a good 
public servant.

We don’t need Oprah. If you 

want a candidate with a record of 
taking on gender issues, especially 
sexual assault, see Senator Kirsten 
Gillibrand, D—N.Y. She has had a 
history of advocating for women’s 
rights, 
especially 
combating 

sexual 
harassment. 
Gillibrand 

got her bachelor’s degree from 
Dartmouth in Asian Studies and 
went to law school at UCLA. In her 
career, she has worked as special 
counsel to Andrew Cuomo, then—
U.S. Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development—and served 
as a member of the House of 
Representatives. She is eminently 
more 
qualified 
than 
Oprah 

Winfrey and deserves your vote.

If a minority woman who has 

broken down barriers her whole 
life is more your speed, look no 
further than Senator Kamala 
Harris, D—Calif. Harris, a senator 
from California, is the second 
African American woman in the 
Senate and first Indian American. 

She received her bachelor’s in 
political science and economics 
from Howard University and 
her law degree from Hastings 
College. 
Furthermore, 
the 

senator has worked as a district 
attorney 
and 
as 
California’s 

attorney general. She is also 
richly deserving of your vote.

That right there is the crux 

of the issue — as soon as you 
pit Oprah against any qualified 
politician who has committed 
their life to serving, she should 
never stand a chance. Yet, a recent 
poll of a possible Democratic 
primary 
has 
her 
handily 

beating Gillibrand and Senator 
Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass. 

in a hypothetical one-on-one 
matchups. So, it’s up to Oprah to 
do what’s best for our country 
and come out and definitively say 
she’s not running.

Oprah, 
we 
all 
love 
you. 

Your 
humanitarian 
work 
is 

unparalleled, and your impact 
as a role model can never be 
forgotten. I’m not even saying 
you would be a bad president — 
you have shown your ability and 
intellect time and time again. 
However, this isn’t about you. 
This is about the office of the 
President of the United States. 
This is about having enough 
respect for that office to say that 
not just anybody can do the job. 
This is about reaffirming the fact 
that to be president, you actually 
need to know what you are doing.

Selfishly, this is about me. This 

is about me waking up at 8:30 a.m. 
and learning about autocracies 
and then campaigning in the 
evenings because I hope to one 
day be the President of the United 
States and be in the position to lift 
up a nation. Oprah, please don’t 
do it because I want to one day 
run for office in a country where 
we still recognize the work and 
sacrifices it takes to have that 
unparalleled responsibility.

entral Student Government President Anushka Sarkar, an LSA senior, 
concluded the Fall 2017 semester by vetoing resolution A.R. 7-026, 
which would have called for the use of University of Michigan funding 

to monetarily compensate members of CSG for their work. While this veto 
means CSG cannot further pursue the specific resolution, Sarkar has said that 
she is continuing to reach out to University bodies such as the Office of Student 
Life to seek an alternative solution to compensate members.

The lack of

in elections 

undermines CSG’s

Podcasts are the world’s most 
underrated form of entertainment. 
Originating in the mid-2000s after 
the debut of the original iPod, 
podcasts have slowly grown to 
become a dominant form of audio 
entertainment, with everything 
from 
TV 
recaps 
to 
political 
punditry to gardening. Unlike 
movies or TV shows, podcasts can 
be listened to on the go, and unlike 
radio, you don’t have to tune in 
at a specific time to listen to your 
favorite host. While podcasts have 
become popular, they have yet to 
achieve the level of critical and 
commercial success of TV, movies 
and music.
My personal experience with 
podcasts dates back to the summer 
of 2007. As many of you might 
remember, that was the summer 
that 
“Harry 
Potter 
and 
the 
Deathly Hallows” was released in 
bookstores. Being the savvy nine-
year-old pop culture expert that 
I was, I was of course completely 
obsessed. My family took a lot of 
road trips up to my grandparents’ 
place in northern Michigan that 
summer, and my dad decided to 
do a search for “Harry Potter” 
on iTunes in order to keep me 
entertained during the rides. What 
he found was a podcast called 
“MuggleCast: The #1 Harry Potter 
Podcast,” and the rest is history. I 
spent the entire summer listening 
to episodes of MuggleCast on the 
family iPod, and I never stopped. 
There’s 
something 
personal 
about podcasts, something that 
approaches the level of intimacy 
a viewer might have experienced 
in the past from a radio host 
or a network broadcaster they 
particularly liked. Podcasts are 
niche radio. To the nine-year-old 
obsessed with Hogwarts, and the 
parents tired of hearing about it 
from their kid, the idea of a show 
where they talked about “Harry 
Potter” for an hour every single 
week was mind-blowing.
MuggleCast 
was 
my 
first 
experience with podcasts, but 

it was far from my last. Today, I 
listen to almost a dozen different 
podcasts on a regular basis. While 
many of my friends struggle to 
keep up with all of their favorite 
TV shows in college, I easily 
breeze through dozens of podcast 
episodes a month. I live in a house 
off campus, which is about a 
15-20 minute walk from the diag. 
Podcasts are a wonderful way 

to make the walk go by faster, 
especially in the winter. I can get 
my political fix from “Pod Save 
America,” a left-leaning political 
podcast hosted by former Obama 
speechwriters, wallow in my grief 
over the latest Michigan football 
season with the writers from 
Mgoblog on the “The MgoPodcast” 
or geek out over movies by listening 
to “Total Geekall” and “How Did 
this Get Made?” I’ve found there’s 
a podcast for every opportunity. 
Need to clean your bedroom or do 
laundry? Listen to a podcast. Have 
some mindless math homework 
to do? Listen to a podcast. Unlike 
music, you don’t have to worry 
about 
fumbling 
around 
with 
your phone in the cold weather 
to change the song or the playlist 
or the album. Put your hour-long 
podcast on and you’re good for the 
entire day.
There’s an easy friendliness 
to podcasting lends itself well to 
today’s diversified and increasingly 
niche 
entertainment 
market. 
There are “Game of Thrones” 
podcasts for people who have 

only read the books. There are 
podcasts about other podcasts. 
Podcasting is like listening in on a 
conversation between a group of 
friends talking exclusively about 
a subject you know you will enjoy. 
That’s part of what makes podcasts 
work. The distance between the 
listener and the podcasters feels 
very small. Anyone could start a 
podcast really. This semester, The 
Daily is expanding our repertoire 
of podcasts to focus on culture, 
news and student life in Ann Arbor. 
Many of the most popular podcasts 
today are ones that were started by 
a couple of friends who just liked 
to talk about history, or football, 
or movies, or painting, or bowling 
or whatever. That’s the genius 
of podcasts. There is literally 
something for everyone.
I don’t have time to watch TV. I 
struggle to get to the movies to see 
everything I want to. I still haven’t 
seen “Call Me By Your Name,” “The 
Shape of Water” or “Lady Bird” and 
am therefore a disgrace to the Arts 
section. It’s a good thing “Game 
of Thrones” always airs in the 
summer, because my Sunday nights 
are always filled with meetings. I 
don’t have time to watch as many 
things as I want to. What I do have 
time for is podcasts. I have time for 
podcasts because podcasts don’t 
require my time. I can listen to them 
while making myself breakfast or 
while I’m taking a shower. On long 
car drives or airplane rides or while 
going to the gym, podcasts are the 
ultimate media for multitasking. 
There’s a low barrier for entry. 
Most podcasts are easy to jump 
right into, no matter how many 
years they’ve been running. The 
power of podcasts is that of an 
incredibly versatile medium, one 
that, while still in its infancy, has 
already become one of the most 
prolific forms of entertainment 
on the planet. For me, as for many 
others, podcasts have become a 
regular part of our everyday lives.
And yes, every Monday, I still 
listen to MuggleCast. Always.

The Power of Podcasts

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

IAN HARRIS

Folk music has always been 
tied to place. Depending on 
where you look in history, you 
can attach the word “folk” to 
Celtic traditions in Scotland and 
Ireland, early recordings from 
the mountains of Appalachia or 
the songs and spirituals passed 
down from days of slavery in 
the South, to name only a few. 
While this might seem like it 
would splinter the genre, it is 
in fact one of its most unifying 
qualities: The idea that by 
using a few instruments and 
writing what they feel, people 
can bring a sense of community 
into their music, no matter 
where they are.
In 
Ruins, 
First 
Aid 
Kit 
carries on a tradition already 
established by some of the 
greatest folk artists out there: 
They extend the genre beyond 
place by rooting themselves 
within the music itself. Their 
brand of folk music isn’t tied 
to a specific place or people; 
it’s a feeling, an honesty, that 
they carry with them wherever 

they go. Sisters Klara and 
Johanna Söderberg hail from 
Sweden, but over the course 
of Ruins, they refrain from 
tying themselves to one place: 
climbing mountains in “Ruins,” 
standing on a Chicago beach 
in “Fireworks.” Sometimes it 
feels like they’re leading you 
through the sweeping deserts 
of 
California, 
while 
other 
songs, 
notably 
“Postcard,” 
sound like they could have 
come straight out of some 
intimate venue in Nashville. 
Closing your eyes, you can 
almost feel the warmth; you 
can almost see the piano keys 
under the dusky starlight and 
the silhouetted heads of the 
people around you.
Part of what earns First Aid 
Kit this brand of universality 
is their shrewd attention to 
lyricism. One thing you can say 
definitively about this band is 
that they understand how to 
make folk smart. Rather than 
falling prey to the looping 
phrases and overused tropes 
that are often the trademarks 
of 
mediocre 
folk 
(relying 
too heavily on the listener’s 
sentimentality), they continue 

to strike a successful balance 
between visual scenes and 
personal 
confessions. 
The 
complete package comes across 

‘Leave No Trace’ marks 
Granik’s narrative return

Parent-child 
relationships 
are often difficult to portray on 
film, simply because, well, most 
of us are pretty familiar with our 
own. “Lady Bird” was successful 
for so many reasons, but chief 
among them was the delicate 
rapport between Lady Bird and 
her mother, drawn so completely 
that calling one’s mother after 
watching 
the 
film 
became 
something of a phenomenon. On 
the other side of the coin, one of 
last year’s worst films, “The Book 
of Henry,” featured a super-duper 
strange mother-child relationship 
(amid a slew of other errors) that 
forcibly removed any viewer from 
empathizing with any character.
Count “Leave No Trace,” the 
latest film from Debra Granik 
and her first narrative film since 
“Winter’s Bone,” in the former 
camp. Set against the lush green 
pinewood forests of Oregon and 
Washington, “Leave No Trace” is 
a patient and heart-wrenching tale 
of father and daughter living off 
the grid, in the wilderness and on 
the run from authorities that wish 
to incarcerate them in ordinary 

domesticity. Ben Foster (“Hell or 
High Water”), sporting a nearly 
shaved head and a full beard, plays 
Will, who lives with his daughter, 
Tom (Thomasin McKenzie, “The 
Hobbit: The Battle of the Five 
Armies”), in the liminal space of 
society — in a tent in the public 
lands of Portland, and, since Will 
is a veteran with PTSD, on the 
margins of public consciousness. 
“Leave No Trace” finds a 
satisfying middle ground between 
gritty, 
which 
could 
describe 
“Winter’s Bone” and certainly 
what audiences had been expecting 
of 
the 
film, 
and 
cartoonish, 
which is now how the similarly 
themed “Captain Fantastic” will 
be understood. Will and Tom are 
capital-r Real, with a relationship 
that is something like lightning in a 
bottle. That the two sitting quietly 
together, wordlessly in each other’s 
company, is compelling cinema 
is a testament to Granik’s ability 
to create carefully constructed 
characters 
and 
drama. 
The 
screenplay by Granik and frequent 
collaborator Anne Rosellini (“Stray 
Dog”), adapted from the novel “My 
Abandonment” by Peter Rock, uses 
a simple functionalism to slowly 
drip details about Will’s past and 
create tension that feels both 

natural and enthralling.
Will and Tom, on the run, 
provide larger symbolism for the 
greater veteran experience. We 
know little of Will’s past, only that 
he is a veteran, he involves himself 
in an illicit drug market among 
other vets and he has, on at least 
one occasion, a PTSD-induced 
nightmare involving an airplane, 
weaved into the film only sonically. 
Later, we see a newspaper headline 
that further resolves the mystery, 
but there’s still much left that’s 
uncertain. And yet, that’s all we 
really need to know to understand 
Will. In Portland, he and Tom are 
crushed by the churning gears of 
bureaucratic machination. In the 
wilderness, they’re free.
Foster deserves recognition, but 
McKenzie, with a stoic face and 
a weary slight monotone, steals 
the show. She is truly excellent as 
Tom, who is independent-minded 
yet empathetic, conscious of her 
father’s place in the world, and 
her own as well. She lights up the 
screen with a measured confidence 
that can take years to develop. The 
film’s score, with its eerie violins 
that soar and scrape above ambient 
whisperings, create a tension that 
somehow feels at peace with itself. 
Granik is back.

DANIEL HENSEL
Daily Arts Writer

like a lost diary or a book of 
poems. Equally impressive is 
their ability to render emotions 
simply and eloquently. Lines 
like, “Send me a postcard / 
When you get to where you’re 
going / Send me a line / To 
everything you’ve left behind,” 
coupled 
with 
yearningly 
beautiful 
vocal 
deliveries 
from the Söderbergs are both 
deceptively simple and utterly 
heartbreaking.
Lyrics aside, 
Ruins is also 
beautiful in a 
musical sense. 
In “Fireworks,” 
you can hear 
the 
sisters 
exploring every syllable with 
voices that sound made for 
each other. “My Wild Sweet 
Love” espouses a dreaminess 
to match its own lyrics. One 
of the album’s highlights is its 
cohesion between lyrics and 
melody. “To Live a Life” and 
“Distant Star” both walk you 
through 
seamless, 
singular 
transformations; 
you 
can 
literally hear it, in the melody 
and in the lyrics, how the 
speaker is finishing the song 
in a different place from where 

they began.
All in all, Ruins is a journey 
lived step-by-step. In the space 
of 40 minutes, the Söderbergs 
glide 
between 
dread, 
self-
examination, 
honesty, 
loss 
and the wrong sides of love, 
the sides that make you wake 
up 
feeling 
burnt. 
They’re 
natural and self-conscious at 
the same time, with lines like, 
“Goodbye never seems finished 
/ Just like these 
songs that I write,” 
from 
the 
even-
paced yet anxious 
“Distant Star.” Each 
song feels like a 
clear and isolated 
shift, all building 
toward a conclusion that in 
a way feels twofold. There’s 
the rage, blame and regret 
mixed together in “Hem of 
Her Dress,” the understated 
penultimate 
track, 
which 
includes lines that are literally 
snarled and shouted. It fades 
out into clapping, lending itself 
to the live feel of the album — 
which is quickly ditched in the 
final song, “Nothing Has to 
Be True.” A confessional with 
glowing lines like, “You can 
tell yourself so many things / 

And nothing has to be true,” it 
ultimately slams to black with 
an abrupt ending that sounds 
like an aux cord being pulled 
away.
“Now I feel so far away / 
From the person I once was,” 
the sisters sing during these 
final few minutes. And so do 
we: The album is a complete 
journey from start to finish, in 
an almost tangible sense. But 
the peak is the second track, 
“It’s a Shame,” which sails 
effortlessly between a verse 
that makes you want to roll 
down your windows and sing, 
and a chorus that makes you 
want to open yourself up and 
cry. In a way, this is a perfect 
example of what the entire 
album is really doing. First Aid 
Kit are opening themselves 
up to you and inviting you to 
open yourself back, showing 
you firsthand what you have to 
lose and how you will survive 
losing it, what you have to gain 
and how you will win it. They 
invite you to unloose yourself, 
starting 
at 
the 
heart 
and 
working outwards. And you 
don’t have to, but there are so 
many beautiful things waiting 
there for you to see if you do.

First Aid Kit’s sophomore, 
‘Ruins’ is fresh, haunting

‘High Maintenance’ blows 
smoke on the competition

The stoner comedy isn’t always 
considered to have intelligent, 
cohesive storytelling. It’s loosely 
structured, the characters are 
high all the time (the main source 
of the humor) and more often than 
not, there are scenes of ridiculous 
slapstick, 
kooky 
psychedelic 
trips and ironic melodrama. But 
when contextualized in a more 
timely, socially relevant setting, 
the stoner comedy can actually 
be an enlightening 
commentary 
on 
how a person’s need 
for weed informs 
their 
neuroses. 
HBO’s 
criminally 
underrated 
series 
“High 
Maintenance” has 
already taken that 
step — and then 
some.
Ben Sinclair (“Home Again”) 
and Katja Blichfeld (“30 Rock”) 
co-created, 
co-wrote 
and 
co-directed “High Maintenance” 
as a Vimeo web series back in 
2012. Though the show has grown 
tremendously since its humble 
origins, the premise has remained 
the same: A nameless Brooklyn 
weed dealer, known simply as 
The Guy (played by Sinclair), 
delivers pot to a variety of clients. 
Its anthology format gives us a 
glimpse into the private lives of 
The Guy’s regular buyers, who 
range from the ordinary to the 
eccentric.
“High Maintenance” may share 
some the formulaic qualities that 
define 
other 
cannabis-tinged 
farces, but it’s no “Pineapple 
Express” or “Cheech and Chong”; 
it’s 
something 
much, 
much 
better. Sinclair and Blichfeld’s 
humanistic approach to the stoner 
comedy redefines the subgenre 
entirely. The two have crafted 
a deceptively meticulous and 

aesthetically 
radiant 
world, 
replete with sharp, insightful and 
entertaining vignettes of people 
from all different backgrounds. 
Because every episode introduces 
new characters, most of whom are 
unknown actors (save for a few), 
“High Maintenance” excels at 
capturing the multidimensionality 
of contemporary society better 
than most TV shows currently on 
air.
While the first season was 
focused more on the lifestyles 
of New York City potheads, the 
second season explores the role 
of weed as a coping 
mechanism 
in 
the 
Trump 
era. 
In the wonderful 
season 
opener 
“Globo,” The Guy 
and his girlfriend 
Beth (Yael Stone, 
“Orange is the New 
Black”) awaken to 
news of a horrible 
unnamed tragedy — the details 
are kept vague, but their reactions 
mirror the national devastation 
felt the day after Trump’s election. 
Instead of depicting the people 
affected by Trump’s imminent 
presidency, “Globo” focuses on 
the marginal experiences of The 
Guy’s unaffected clientele: A 
body-insecure man is pressured 
to go to the gym, a woman and 
two dudes engage in a threesome 
at a hotel and a burned-out Latino 
restaurant worker takes the late-
night 
subway. 
Conversations 
about the tragedy are peppered 
throughout “Globo,” and The Guy 
appears briefly in each subplot, 
but it’s the episode’s theme of 
modern dread that ties everything 
together. The mere averageness of 
each character and how they move 
through the world draw attention 
to the weight of their ongoing 
angst, and weed, as a result, helps 
them get through the day.
The 
second 
season 
also 
benefits from the addition of 
creative voices behind the scenes. 

While Sinclair and Blichfeld’s 
dual collaboration was enough 
to build “High Maintenance” 
to what it is, the expansion of a 
writer’s room and a new director 
(Shaka 
King, 
“Newlyweeds”) 
help cultivate fresh perspectives 
on weed culture. The third 
episode, “Namaste,” illustrates 
the challenges of class divides 
through the idealistic aspirations 
of a struggling realtor attempting 
to find a new home of her own 
(Danielle Brooks, “Master of 
None”) and a disillusioned couple 
moving from a co-op to a polished 
apartment. The fifth episode, 
“Scromple,” lets us know more 
about the personal life of The 
Guy, as it reveals a deeper, quieter 
pain 
buried 
underneath 
his 
generally nonchalant demeanor. 
The Guy’s subtle suffering in this 
particular episode is made only 
more devastating by Sinclair’s 
understated performance. 
Granted, “High Maintenance” 
may not be everyone’s cup of 
tea. Most stories end without 
any 
closure, 
often 
abruptly 
transitioning right to the next set 
of characters — think Richard 
Linklater’s “Slacker” but with 
more marijuana. Most episodes 
don’t have a typical conflict/
resolution 
setup, 
instead 
showcasing the randomness of 
everyday 
life, 
either 
through 
poignant 
incidental 
situations 
(a drag queen and an exiled 
Orthodox Jew cross paths in the 
standout “Derech”) or hilariously 
strange 
coincidences 
(a 
pet 
snake slithers into two unrelated 
storylines in the amusing “Fagin”). 
But even if its unconventional, 
unpredictable plotting isn’t tailor-
made for mainstream audiences, 
“High Maintenance” is still such 
a fascinating, magnetic watch. 
It’s a show that feels very in 
the moment, striking a unique 
balance between universality and 
specificity through the everyday 
experiences of flawed, weed-
loving people.

A Night Over the Rainbow

What do you hope to find in 
a room? How do you want to use 
this space? Whether it be engaging 
in a one-on-one performance, 
simply witnessing others partake 
or staying for one rendition of 
“Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” 
all is welcome as FK Alexander 
takes over the STAMPS gallery 
with her performance of “(I Could 
Go on Singing) Over the Rainbow” 
starting this Friday, Jan. 26.
The space will be open to 
everyone and every experience. 
Alexander 
argues 
that 
one 
reaction is just as valuable as 
another.
“Whatever people’s responses 
are, I hope they know that they 
are equal and that they are all 
welcome,” said Alexander in an 
interview with The Daily. “Some 
people want to stay there forever 
and some people turn out after 10 
minutes and they’re just like, ‘she’s 
just doing that one song.’”
The 
performance 
consists 
of 
multiple 
renditions 
of 
“Somewhere Over the Rainbow” 
backed my the Okishima Tourist 
Association playing noise music 
out of small, mysterious, Oz-esque 
boxes.
“They’re playing a kind of lull 
of noise; It’s not totally chaotic 
noise, it’s very carefully crafted,” 
Alexander said. Not only does it add 
background to the performance, 
but it also complicates the song. 
“It brings out a tension in the song, 
and the song is also bringing about 
a tension in that soundscape that’s 
happening.”
“There is not a story. There 
is not a beginning, a middle and 
an end. It’s this. It’s one thing,” 
Alexander explained. But while 
the performance itself is not 
a story, the audience creates a 
story on the spot. Each individual 
narrative may differ vastly, but 
it is the collective narrative that 
creates the story as a whole.
While the idea of an entire 
performance consisting of just 
one song may initially seem a bit 
daunting, it is in the repetition, the 

connection and the experience 
in which individuals will find 
meaning. 
Through 
repetition, 
Alexander strives to experience 
what Judy Garland may have 
experienced over the course of her 
life.
“For everyone who heard Judy 
sing it in a concert, that was the 
one and only time she was going 
to sing it for them,” Alexander 
explained. For each and every 
repetition to be for someone and 
to be more than just one of many: 

That honesty and sincerity were 
fundamental aspects that inspired 
this show.
“The sacrifice which Judy 
made for other people to have this 
moment, where maybe they felt 
like they were over the rainbow, 
was just devastatingly poignant 
and beautiful to me.” In an attempt 
to reveal this beautiful sacrifice, 
Alexander’s 
performance 
ventures to give more people an 
over the rainbow moment.
There are so many ways that we 
try to make others understand, but 
too often it feels incommunicable. 
There is only so much that words 
can do, and at a certain point 
they lose any sort of power at all. 
Alexander argued that words 
can even block the way to pure 
understanding.
“As much as words can really 
allow people to understand what 
you are trying to say, they can also 
really alienate people as well,” 
Alexander said
But then, art steps in. Pathways 

to communication open as art, 
and performance give people 
an experience, or a “sensation,” 
which permits understanding. 
Alexander uses the power of 
performance 
to 
communicate 
her own, and Judy Garland’s, 
experiences with her audience.
Alexander is far from lacking 
in experience. Stemming from 
her recovery, her performance has 
less to do with the unimaginable 
hardships and everything to do 
with the fight back. Through 
Judy’s 
experience, 
Alexander 
realized that the “struggle is 
beautiful,” and that “the fight 
against the parts of yourself that 
are saying ‘you can’t do this,’ that 
is actually just as beautiful as 
success.”
“What Judy really spoke about 
a lot was that this struggle towards 
a happy ending was life, that 
was the thing. Over the rainbow 
doesn’t exist,” Alexander said, 
“but maybe there are moments in 
our lives when we feel it, when you 
do get a little bit over the rainbow 
moment, but you can’t live there, 
you can’t live in Oz.”
Honest, 
selfless 
and 
empowering, 
FK 
Alexander’s 
performance 
opens 
the 
door 
for the audience to reflect and 
learn by experience. Promoting 
connection and communication 
through her performance, there 
will be something to take away for 
every individual, even if it is just 
knowing whether you want to be 
there at all. In a world where both 
communication and acceptance 
can feel impossible, spending an 
hour where those things thrive 
makes it hard to turn away.
Perseverance is a struggle 
that we all face, but the beauty in 
continuing on is sometimes hard 
to see. It is from Judy Garland 
that FK Alexander found her 
way to recovery, and it is from 
FK Alexander that the audience 
will find inspiration to keep going 
through whatever may stand in 
their way.
“Can’t go on, can’t go on, but 
you’ll go,” Alexander said. “If you 
just keep going then it will get 
better; it will get better tomorrow 
even.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

“Juliet, Naked,” the latest effort 
from producer Judd Apatow (“The 
Big Sick”) and director Jesse 
Peretz (“Our Idiot Brother”), isn’t 
nearly a failure because of what 
the movie does, but because of 
what it doesn’t do. With a great 
pedigree — Apatow, original book 
by Nick Hornby and screenplay 
by 
masters 
Tamara 
Jenkins 
(“The 
Savages”), 
Phil 
Alden 
Robinson (“Field of Dreams”) 
and Jim Taylor (“Sideways”) — 
it’s a disappointment that “Juliet, 
Naked” falls as flat as it does.
Annie (Rose Byrne, “Spy”) 
is angered by her long-term 
boyfriend’s 
obsession 
with 
American rocker Tucker Crowe 
(Ethan 
Hawke, 
“Maudie”). 
Tucker, with the melancholy of 
Elliott Smith and the sort of broken 
timbre of Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, 
is all Duncan (Chris O’Dowd, 
“Loving Vincent”) can talk about. 
He has a room — nay, a shrine — 
devoted to his collection of Crowe 
memorabilia, and runs a website 
dedicated to curating his fandom 
through his investigative stitching 
of Tucker’s life. Duncan hides 

away in his lair after he discovers 
a disc of demos previously thought 
to never exist. This draws Annie to 
a breaking point, and she does the 
unthinkable, leaving a scathing 
comment on his review tearing 
her boyfriend to pieces. Crowe, 
miraculously, reads the comment, 
and in his nigh depressed state, 
writes to her that she was dead-
on in her criticism. They develop 
an online romance until Crowe 
comes 
to 
London 
after 
his 
daughter goes into labor. 
For a movie that tries to examine 
the parameters of relationships 
— parent-child, partner-partner, 
artist-fan, sister-sister — “Juliet, 
Naked” surprisingly finds its 
strength in its individuals, and 
decidedly not in the interplay 
and exchanges between a pair. 
While Byrne, wresting the leading 
role from O’Dowd, and Hawke, 
endearing in his own way, bring 
vibrancy to their respective roles, 
their chemistry never feels quite 
truthful. It’s not that they’re 
acting in two separate movies; it’s 
that, in relying on the plot alone 
to forge their connection, they 
neglected to do it themselves.
The same can be said about 
the relationship between Byrne 
and O’Dowd, the central focus 

of the film in its first half. Annie 
and Duncan have been partners 
for a long time, enough to have 
discussed 
children, 
but 
they 
can hardly stand one another. 
There’s a lack of genuine love and 
care for one another that makes 
the pairing seem like a doomed 
relationship, even considering the 
external tension between the two 
on Tucker Crowe’s musical ability. 
The film just never quite makes 
a convincing case that we should 
care.
Ultimately, 
“Juliet, 
Naked” 
tries to do too much in too little 
time. Rather than luxuriate in 
the ideas it sets out to discuss, like 
celebrity, spousal infidelity and 
parenthood, Peretz’s film splashes 
water before getting out of the 
shallow end. On top of the trite 
and overdone film sequences, the 
lack of focus makes almost every 
emotional beat a miss. The film 
is occasionally funny, especially 
in scenes that involve Annie’s 
flamboyantly 
flirtatious 
sister 
Rose (Lily Brazier, “People Just 
Do Nothing”) or the screwball 
madness between Crowe, Duncan 
and Annie. Sadly, only a few punch 
lines land. When the lucky few do, 
they reveal the dearth of humor in 
the film.

Simmons continues to earn trust, playing time

Coming into the year, the 

departure of Derrick Walton Jr. 
was perhaps the most painful 
roster hit for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team.

Jaaron Simmons was supposed 

to make it hurt a little bit less.

The 
former 
Mid-American 

conference star was coming off 
a season in which he averaged 
15.9 points, 6.5 assists and 3.5 
rebounds per game for Ohio — 
Walton-esque numbers. Landing 
an experienced graduate transfer 
in Simmons was another example 
of coach John Beilein’s keen, 
seldom-praised recruiting eye.

Because of his polished body 

of work, Simmons was the early 
front-runner for the Wolverines’ 
starting point guard spot. In 
addition 
to 
Simmons’ 
past 

production, the 2016-17 season 
inspired little confidence that 
then-freshman 
point 
guard 

Zavier Simpson could shoulder 
extra responsibility. 

But fast forward nine months 

since Simmons’ announcement, 
and it looks like an experiment 
gone wrong. His current statline 

of 1.4 points, 1.4 assists and 0.7 
boards is beyond falling off a cliff. 
It’s hitting rock bottom. Until 
recently, he sat behind Simpson 
and freshman Eli Brooks.

Being relegated to the role 

of the backup’s backup wasn’t a 
shock, even to the casual observer. 
Simmons looked uncomfortable, 
either with sloppy ball-handling 
or an inability to create a shot 
for himself, a skill that was on 
display with the 
Bobcats. 
After 

registering 
10.9 

minutes a game 
through the first 
eight games, that 
number 
dipped 

further 
to 
6.2 

in the next 11 
contests, five of 
which he didn’t 
play in. Coach’s 
decision.

“We 
had 

different rules (than Ohio) that 
he wasn’t picking up as quickly,” 
Beilein said Sunday. “… He’s 
handled it like a champion. I told 
his parents they should be so 
proud of how he’s handled it. He 
gave up a lot to come here to play 
on the big stage. It hasn’t worked 

out so far.”

Against Maryland on Jan. 15, 

though, it appeared that Simmons 
had turned a corner. With 2:47 
remaining in the first half, down 
14 points in Michigan’s worst 
first-half performance to date, 
Beilein subbed Simmons in. At 
the time, Beilein’s decision was 
a head-scratcher — did he have 
a good week of practice? Was 
there an injury to Brooks or 

Simpson? Either 
way, it worked. 
Simmons 
capably piloted 
a 
6-2 
run, 

narrowing 
the 

halftime deficit 
to 10, and scored 
his 
first 
field 

goal — a buzzer-
beating layup — 
since Nov. 29 at 
North Carolina.

The 
choice 

became clearer.

“We needed Eli to get his 

confidence back,” Beilein said. 
“… Where Jaaron, we put him 
on the scout team, he did some 
really good things. We just made 
that flip. Eli watched the game 
a little bit and we let Jaaron go. 

He’s given us some things. He’s 
playing better defense.”

In Michigan’s following two 

games, Simmons’ numbers were 
hardly showy — most wouldn’t 
bat an eye at a combined six 
points and two rebounds in a two-
game span — but they display a 
previously unseen progression 
in his game. He has assumed the 
No. 2 role over Brooks as the first 
point guard off the bench against 
Nebraska and Rutgers.

In Sunday’s contest versus 

the Scarlet Knights, Simmons 
shot the ball four times in eight 
minutes, tying a season high, 
while Brooks didn’t see the floor. 
It’s what regaining confidence 
looks like after the toughest 
stretch of his college career.

“Even though he didn’t make 

his shots, all of them looked 
good,” 
said 
junior 
forward 

Moritz Wagner. “I told him to 
keep shooting, it looked great. 
Jaaron’s a really good player, he 
averaged like 18 points last year. I 
never averaged that many points. 
We all know he can hoop. I’ve 
been very impressed with the 
way he’s handling adversity this 
year. That’s the sign of a great 
teammate and he doesn’t care 
about any person or agenda. He 
just plays.”

Added Beilein: “I think down 

the stretch, if he makes a couple 
3s (against Rutgers) that he 
makes in practice, I think we’re 
talking about him a lot more right 
now, and we will.”

It remains to be seen whether 

Simmons’ 
trajectory 
will 

continue to trend upward. If 
it does, it’s a change that the 
Wolverines 
would 
welcome 

with open arms. Simpson is 
not the starting point guard 
that Walton was — an offensive 
lynchpin playing 35 minutes a 
game. Simpson averages just 
21.7 minutes per game. Having 
a guy who can come in when 
Simpson struggles could allow 
the Wolverines to make some 
noise come March.

A confident Jaaron Simmons 

can be that guy.

Seniors lead Michigan 
over OSU and Va. Tech

With less than a month 

left 
until 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championships, the tri-meet 
victory over No. 16 Ohio State 
and No. 19 Virginia Tech this 
weekend was a solid start for 
the Michigan men’s swimming 
and diving team.

The meet — held Saturday at 

McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion in 
Columbus — turned out to be 
a battle until the last minute. 
The seventh-ranked Wolverines 
defeated the Buckeyes (157-143) 
and the Hokies (196-104) for a 
first-place victory in the second 
meet of the year.

The 

competition 
against 
Ohio 
State 

came 
down 

to 
the 
wire. 

Michigan and 
the 
Buckeyes 

were tied at 75 
points halfway 
through 
the 

meet. Though 
Ohio 
State 

inched ahead after the half 
with a victory in the 100-
yard freestyle, the Wolverines 
swam with urgency, eventually 
clinching 
the 
victory 
with 

the help of six consecutive 
individual event wins.

The 
upperclassmen 
made 

significant 
contributions 
en 

route to the victory on Saturday.

“We were led by our seniors,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mike 

Bottom. “There’s no doubt they 
were the leaders. Evan White, 
PJ Ransford, Tristan Sanders 
and Paul Powers all led us in 
different ways.”

White placed first in three 

events including the 100-yard 
(47.07) and 200-yard butterfly 
(1:45.11). White also touched 
first in the 200-yard IM with a 

time of 1:48.10. With the help of 
Ransford in the long-distance 
events, Powers in freestyle 
and Sanders in backstroke, the 
Wolverines were able to tally 
valuable points to secure the 
team’s win.

Additionally, 
sophomores 

Jacob 
Montague, 
Jeremy 

Babinet, 
Tommy 
Cope 
and 

Charlie 
Swanson 
came 
out 

victorious in the breaststroke 
events. 
Montague, 
Babinet 

and Swanson touched 1-2-3 
in the 100-yard breaststroke 
and Cope, Montague, Swanson 
and Babinet touched 1-2-4-5, 
respectively in the 200-yard 
breaststroke.

As 
for 
the 
diving 
unit, 

freshman 
Ross 

Todd 
competed 

in 
Saturday’s 

meet after sitting 
out the Indiana 
meet last week 
due to an injury. 
Todd 
placed 

third, the highest 
among Michigan 
competitors.

“The team was 

tired but we came 

down and worked hard this 
week,” Bottom said. “We came 
off a dual meet with Indiana and 
got right back in to work. They 
still got up and raced hard.”

Though 
Michigan 
battled 

hard this weekend and pulled 
out a well-earned win, Bottom 
believes 
there 
are 
several 

things that can be improved 
upon 
before 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championships next month.

“Today was preparation for 

the Big Ten,” Bottom said. “I 
hope everyone continues to get 
better. In around seven to eight 
swims, we got out touched by 
less than 3/10ths (of a second). 
Those are the things we have 
to be tougher on. Make sure the 
last five meters are Michigan 
territory.”

JODI YIP
For the Daily

“The team was 

tired but we 

came down and 
worked hard.”

After Lockwood’s injury, new second line emerges to propel Michigan’s offense

Fans didn’t even have a chance 

to get comfortable at Yost Ice 
Arena 
before 
the 
Michigan 

hockey team found Penn State’s 
net Saturday night. Thanks to a 
crisp pass from junior Brendan 
Warren as he raced down the left 
side, freshman Josh Norris got 
a perfect set up for a textbook 
one-timer just 26 seconds into 
the game.

The goal was generated with 

apparent ease, characteristic of 
linemates who are well-adjusted 
to sharing shifts and are familiar 
with each other’s positioning on 
the ice. However, for this line, it 
had just been a matter of weeks 
together.

Warren 
and 
Norris, 
in 

addition to sophomore Jake 
Slaker, played as a unit for the 
first time two weekends ago, 
comprising 
the 
Wolverines’ 

second line in the Minnesota 
series.

In light of Will Lockwood’s 

shoulder injury at the World 
Junior Championships — taking 
the sophomore forward out 
of commission for likely the 
remainder of the season — 
tweaks to Michigan’s second 
line 
were 
inevitable. 
What 

wasn’t a given, though, was the 
smoothness of their transition.

“We haven’t even really talked 

about Will, within the team, 
that we don’t have him,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
after practice on Tuesday. “That 
someone has to step up, they all 
understand that. I think that 
certain players take advantage 
of opportunities. … and I think 
(Warren, Norris and Slaker) 
have.”

And not only did each of the 

three individually step up to fill 
the void, but they also clicked as 
a unit.

In 
the 
series 
with 
the 

Golden Gophers, this second 
line 
was 
responsible 
for 

half of Michigan’s offensive 
production. Warren supplied 
two goals in the first game, and 
then — just a minute into the 
second game — was set up by 
Norris to light the lamp for the 
third time that weekend. Norris 
got on the scoreboard as well, 
burying the puck on a man-
advantage off a feed from Slaker.

Against the Nittany Lions 

the following weekend, the line 
showed its initial performance 
was 
no 
fluke. 
Collectively, 

the trio accounted for three 
of the weekend’s seven goals, 
including half the goals in 

Friday night’s shutout.

Pearson attributes this to 

natural chemistry and each line 
member’s versatility.

“They play off of each other,” 

Pearson said. “They have some 
speed, there’s some chemistry. 
We talk about chemistry all of 
the time, you can’t force it, it just 
has to sort of occur naturally. 
And it’s occurring.

“Brendan 
has 
some 

physicality to him, I know Josh 
does and Slakes does too. Slakes 
moves the puck, you can see 
the passing, they’ve been fun to 
watch. They’ve got a little bit of 
everything. … I think they’re all 
a little more versatile (than the 
top line).”

While it’s hard to make 

a direct analogy to the top 
upperclassmen line of seniors 
Dexter 
Dancs 
and 
Tony 

Calderone and junior Cooper 
Marody — who went on a 
ten-game 
stretch 
providing 

42.6 
percent 
of 
Michigan’s 

total 
points 
earlier 
in 
the 

season — that doesn’t mean 
similarities are non-existent. 
This new second line has been 
instrumental to the Wolverines’ 
recent dominance, and is a 
sign that Michigan is building 
offensive depth.

And the line is versatile, too. 

Norris 
and 
Slaker 
swapped 

positions 
following 
winter 

break, in addition to acclimating 
to their new line. 

Norris, who played alongside 

freshman defenseman Quinn 
Hughes and Lockwood in the 
World Juniors, returned to find 
he would no longer be playing 
center, 
but 

instead on the 
wing. In Norris’ 
absence, 
Slaker 

assumed 
the 

role of center for 
the Great Lakes 
Invitational and 
handled 
the 

shift with grace. 
Pearson decided 
to let it stick.

“Jake 
was 

doing pretty well there,” Pearson 
said. “So when Josh came back, 
knowing he had played wing 
a little bit in the World Junior, 
we decided to try that, and slide 
him in there and see how it was. 

First game back at Notre Dame, 
(Norris) scored. … With Josh I 
think it’s important that he has 
some versatility.”

And this would be the first 

of many times Norris found 
the net since reuniting with 
the Wolverines. The freshman 
has scored four goals over the 

last five games, 
including 
two 

multi-point 
showings 
over 

that stretch.

But according 

to Norris, these 
accolades 
have 

much more to 
do with his line 
than they do with 
his 
individual 

performance.

“I think we’ve found some 

really 
good 
chemistry 
the 

last couple games, and we’ve 
been hunting the puck on the 
forecheck,” Norris said. “All 
three of us can skate, so I think 

we’ve been playing to our 
strengths.”

Slaker echoed this sentiment, 

adding how the trio’s stylistic 
similarities have helped the line 
find success.

“We were not shy of playing 

in the corner,” he said. “We can 
all do the same thing. We like 
to skate, we like to grind on the 
corners if we have to, but also if 
the puck is on our stick in the 
slot we know how to usually 
find the back of the net.”

And yet, as extensive as the 

line’s 
accomplishments 
have 

been the past two weekends, 
this was a mere four outings. 
This leaves plenty of room for 
the line to make tweaks and 
build chemistry as Michigan 
enters the final month of regular 
season play.

“They haven’t had a lot of time 

together,” Pearson said. “So I 
only think they will continue to 
get better, which I am excited 
and encouraged about.”

Best moments are still ahead for new lacrosse coach, Hannah Nielsen

It started with tennis and a 

t-shirt.

Hannah 
Nielsen 
grew 
up 

playing all sorts of sports in 
Adelaide, Australia. It wasn’t until 
she was 11 years old, though, that 
she even heard of lacrosse. 

“I actually played tennis with a 

girl who had a lacrosse t-shirt on, 
and I had no idea what the sport 
was,” Nielsen said. “She said I 
should come out and try it. I picked 
up a stick and never looked back.”

Nielsen quickly grew to love the 

toughness of the game. She loved 
playing in the heat of summer and 
in the dead of winter. She loved the 
running and the physicality. She 
loved playing in the mud.

By seventh grade, Nielsen was 

sold. Lacrosse would be her sport.

Today, Nielsen finds herself 

weeks way from her first game 
as the second-ever Michigan 
women’s lacrosse coach.

Joining the Brighton Lacrosse 

Club, Nielsen started her journey 
where other lacrosse greats began, 
including 
Loyola 
University 

Maryland women’s lacrosse coach 
Jen Adams.

Adams won the first ever 

Tewaaraton 
Award 
— 
the 

Heisman of collegiate lacrosse 
— in 2001 after her senior season 
at Maryland. There, Adams won 
four national championships and 
finished off her collegiate career 
with a perfect 23-0 season.

Nielsen wanted to follow suit.
“I 
remember 
at 
the 
time 

watching a highlight video of 
an Australian girl playing at 
Maryland and just thought, ‘That’s 
what I want to do,’ ” Nielsen said. 
“Pretty much from there through 
high school, I set my sights on 
getting to college.”

Five years later, Nielsen found 

herself at Northwestern. Though 
she always dreamed of becoming 
a Terrapin like Adams, Nielsen 
believed the Wildcats would be 
the team to beat.

Not only did Nielsen want to be 

a champion, but she wanted to be 
a champion in her own right. At 
Northwestern, she could pave her 
own path.

“Northwestern had just won 

its first national championship,” 
Nielsen said. “I could tell that 
the program was destined for 
great things, and had success in 
their future. It’s something that 
I felt I should be a part of, and at 
the end of the day I wanted to do 
something new. To do something 
that no other Australian had 
done.”

And that she did.
Nielsen 

graduated 
Northwestern 
with 
a 
perfect 

senior 
season 

like Adams. She 
bested 
Adams 

with not one, but 
two Tewaaraton 
Awards in both 
her 
junior 
and 

senior years.

She 
is 
the 

Wildcats’ 
all-time 
leader 
in 

points (398) and assists (224), and 
finished off her collegiate career 
with a 21-7 triumph over North 
Carolina for a fourth and final 
national championship. Nielsen 

remembers the win as her favorite 
on-field moment at Northwestern.

“It was icing on top of an 

incredible season,” she said.

Nielsen’s dominance on the 

lacrosse field didn’t stop there, 
though. In fact, it didn’t even begin 
there.

Before landing in Chicago, and 

before playing a single collegiate 
match, Nielsen was already a 

world champion.

Out 
of 
the 

10 
Women’s 

Lacrosse 
World 

Cups held since 
its 
inaugural 

year in 1982, the 
United 
States 

has 
won 
eight. 

In 2005, Nielsen 
and the rest of 
the 
Australian 

National 
Team 

beat out the Americans on their 
home turf in the gold-medal 
match, 14-7. She was just 17 years 
old.

This past summer, at 29, Nielsen 

competed in her fourth World 

Cup in England, and was selected 
to the 12 player All-World Team 
alongside four of her teammates, 
one being Adams.

“For 
me, 
there’s 
nothing 

better 
than 
playing 
for 
my 

country,” Nielsen said. “Getting to 
represent Australia — for anyone, 
representing your own country 
— I don’t think there’s anything 
better.”

Nielsen’s 

stellar 
career 

as a player has 
translated 
well 

into her quickly 
progressing 
coaching 
career. 

Before 
earning 

her first position 
as a head coach 
at Michigan this 
past 
summer, 

Nielsen 
was 

an assistant coach at her alma 
mater. Previously, she was on 
the coaching staff at Penn State 
and Towson, and helped start 
the women’s lacrosse program at 
Colorado in 2014 — the same year 

Michigan’s program began.

Ironically 
enough, 
the 

Wolverines open up their 2018 
season against the Buffaloes in 
Jacksonville, Fla. on February 9th.

“It’s going to be kind of a crazy 

experience,” Nielsen said. “I’ve 
fortunately coached against them 
before, so it won’t be my first time. 
They still hold a very special place 
in my heart.”

This 
meeting 

will be Michigan’s 
third 
encounter 

with the Buffalos. 
The 
Wolverines 

dropped their first 
battle in a 14-13 
double 
overtime 

thriller back in 
2015. 
Colorado 

widened the gap 
the 
following 

year, dominating 

in an 11-4 showing.

Four seasons in, the Buffalos 

boast a .640 win percentage while 
Michigan sits at .290. Perhaps 
it was Nielsen that influenced 
Colorado’s 
quick 
progression. 

Either way, the matchup is shaping 
up to be a good one. 

“The head coach is a very good 

friend of mine,” Nielsen said. “Both 
of us are very, very competitive, so 
we’re both going to want to win.”

And despite losing 14 seniors to 

graduation last season — most of 
whom were four-year starters — 
Nielsen thinks her team can win. 
She believe the Wolverines have 
athleticism on their side.

Michigan’s current coaching 

staff prides itself on being able to 
teach the game. If the players are 
athletic and have the will to win, 
Nielsen believes they will do just 
that.

“If I were to pick someone 

who’s got that killer instinct and 
athleticism over someone who’s 
got finesse and skill, I’m definitely 
going for that athleticism,” Nielsen 
said. “We like toughness. We like 
gritty players who aren’t afraid 
to do the dirty work that goes 
unnoticed.”

Luckily 
for 
Nielsen, 
the 

previous women’s lacrosse coach, 
Jennifer Ulehla, felt similarly. She 
recruited athletes and believed 
specific skills and lacrosse IQ 
could be taught.

So far, Nielsen says it s all 

coming together.

From day one back in September 

through the end of fall ball, 
Nielsen has seen improvements all 
over the field. The Wolverines are 
beginning to click.

“The best moment so far was our 

last practice of the fall,“ Nielsen 
said. “To sit back as a coaching 
staff and see where we’ve come 
from and where we were at that 
point was really satisfying.”

And where will Michigan be in 

May when the season wraps up?”

“Hopefully in a better place than 

where we started,“ Nielsen said. “I 
hope that we’ve progressed as a 
team and that we’ve got a strong 
belief in all of our values and our 
culture. Hopefully we’ve got some 
wins on the board, as well.”

Nielsen has had what one would 

call a storied career in the lacrosse 
world. 
Coming 
to 
Michigan, 

however, is not the end of the 
story. Coaching is simply her latest 
chapter.

“Honestly,” Nielsen said, “the 

best moments are still to come.”

“It was icing 
on top of an 
incredible 
season.”

“For me, there’s 
nothing better 
than playing for 

my country.”

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty was on fire in the first half and finished with 26 points in Michigan’s 26-point win.

‘M’ dominates in 74-48 win over MSU

The game tipped off at 7:00. It 

was over by 7:10.

It took just over five minutes of 

game time for the No. 16 Michigan 
women’s basketball team (7-2 
Big Ten, 18-4 overall) to build up 
an 18-4 first quarter lead over 
Michigan State (4-4, 14-7). The 
Spartans never came back, or came 
close to doing so, as the Wolverines 
cruised to a 74-48 win.

Ironically, 
things 
started 

tenuously, as junior guard Nicole 
Munger turned the ball over after 
Michigan State trapped a pick-and-
roll on the game’s first possession, 
leading to a transition layup. The 
next time down, when the Spartans 
pulled the same trick against 
senior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
she nearly lost her dribble as well. 
But she found it, along with junior 
center Hallie Thome for a layup.

By the time the Spartans scored 

again, Flaherty had scored six 
points and notched a second assist. 
She rained fire early on, hitting two 
3-pointers off screens, then finding 
freshman forward Hailey Brown 
under the basket when the entire 
Michigan State defense gravitated 
to Flaherty in transition.

In the first half alone, Flaherty 

created 22 points — 12 of her own 
doing and 10 off assists. By the 
end of the game, that number was 

up to 41, through 26 points and 10 
assists, over half of the Wolverines’ 
74 points.

“She got away from us a couple 

times, but, I mean, she gets an open 
look, it’s down,” said Michigan 
State coach Suzy Merchant. “I don’t 
care if she’s playing Michigan State, 
Ohio State — it doesn’t matter. That 
kid is a great, great shooter.”

No 
matter 
the 
question, 

Flaherty was the answer. When 
the Spartans drew within 10 at the 
start of the second half — the only 
time all game in which a comeback 
seemed within reach — she hit a 
3-pointer, drew a foul in transition 
(hitting both free throws), assisted 
a Munger triple, then drained a 
running transition hook shot along 
with the ensuing free throw.

A 36-26 lead ballooned to 47-31. 

Whatever hope Michigan State had 
died. The rest of the contest was a 
mere formality.

“Going into this game, we knew 

that they send all of their players 
to the offensive glass,” Flaherty 
said. “So we knew we could run in 
transition. They’re a bigger team, 
a slower team compared to us, so I 
think we really took advantage of 
that.”

The win marked Michigan’s 

fifth in a row, a streak that now 
includes wins over both the 
Wolverines’ rivals. In a year that 
will be defined by whether or 
not Michigan continues on its 

current path to make the NCAA 
Tournament, the Wolverines are 
galvanized by the scars of being left 
out last season.

“We got robbed last year, not 

getting to the NCAA Tournament,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “And they have been on a 
mission since that announcement 
at March Madness. And we went on 
to win the WNIT Championship, 
but they didn’t even stop working 
after that win. They came back 
this year hungrier than ever...all 
of our returners have something 
to prove. They have a chip on their 
shoulder.

“...It doesn’t ever end. I think 

it’s a constant reminder, because 
the people that came before 
them never got to experience it. 
So (graduate assistant) Danielle 
Williams and Siera Thompson, 
who were seniors for us last year, 
they’ll never get that back. So it 
is a pain, like it’s a gut-wrenching 
pain that will never go away. And 
I think this year’s team is on a 
mission for all Michigan players, 
that this is for you.”

Tuesday was a rivalry victory, 

yes, and one against a program 
Michigan had gone 3-8 against 
during Barnes Arico’s tenure 
coming into tonight.

But it was also one step closer 

to avenge last season’s “robbing,” 
and that’s how the Wolverines will 
remember it.

Achilles heel no longer?

F

ebruary 5, 2015.

That 

was the last 
time 
the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
defeated 
Michigan 
State. 
In 

four straight 
matchups, 
Kim Barnes Arico came up 
empty-handed 
against 
the 

Spartans.

That was the case until 

Tuesday, when the Wolverines 
routed Michigan State, 74 to 48.

“This win is important to our 

university,” Barnes Arico said. 
“It’s important to our players 
in our program. It’s important 
to our state. I mean, it’s just 
important.”

Part of the job description 

when coaching at Michigan is 
how you fair against Michigan 
State and Ohio State. Up until 
this season, those matchups were 
an Achilles heel for Barnes Arico.

And for the first time in her 

career, these rivalry matchups 
are going the right way for Barnes 
Arico. At least they appear to be, 
as the Wolverines have now won 
their last two matchups against 
the two schools.

Prior to Tuesday, the sixth 

year coach posted a 3-8 record 
against her rivals from East 
Lansing. And her record against 
the Buckeyes is only slightly 
better at 3-6, boasting a combined 
.300 
winning 
percentage. 

Despite being the program’s all-
time winningest coach, rivalry 
matchups are a glaring weakness 
for Barnes Arico, as 21 percent of 
her total career losses have come 
at the hands of the Spartans and 
Ohio State. Given the magnitude 
of these matchups, these loses 
must sting particularly bad.

“This is a game that is circled 

on the schedule. Every year,” 
Barnes Arico said. “My first year 
here, we had five seniors on that 

team. They taught me what it 
meant, what this rivalry truly 
meant. And how important it 
was to beat State. (The seniors) 
have been incredible continuing 
to teach our program what that 
really means.”

But 
when 
considering 
all 

factors, Barnes Arico’s previous 
lack of success against rival 
schools should only be taken into 
consideration in part.

Unfortunately 
for 
her, 

Michigan’s two biggest rivals 
have consistently been among 
the best teams in the country, 
notching seven combined NCAA 
Tournament 
appearances 
in 

the five seasons of Barnes Arico 
tenure. The two teams have also 
each been Big Ten champions in 
that timespan.

And while Barnes Arico’s 

numbers aren’t by any means 
good, 
compared 
to 
her 

predecessors, they aren’t bad. 
She has three of the Wolverines 
12 all-time wins against the 
Buckeyes. She also now possesses 
four of Michigan’s five wins over 
the Spartans since the 2003-04 
season.

While the past six seasons 

shouldn’t be forgotten, this is 
the year to start judging Barnes 
Arico against her rivals. Her 
team is currently ranked 16th in 
the country and has appeared 

in the rankings every week this 
season. This is the year Barnes 
Arico 
should 
challenge 
her 

rivals.

And she has.
This year, the Wolverines 

are 2-1 against the two schools, 
with their lone loss coming in 
overtime to then-No. 8 Ohio 
State on January 7th.

Some may say it’s a fluke and 

point to the 2014-15 season, 
where Michigan went 2-0 against 
the Spartans and 1-1 against the 
Buckeyes. They may then note 
that the Wolverines proceeded 
to go 1-4 against Michigan State 
in the following years. And they 
might also say that this is the 
worst Spartan team in years and 
had multiple injured players on 
Tuesday.

And they’re right – somewhat.
Yes, for Michigan to qualify 

for the NCAA Tournament and 
become a staple in the national 
rankings, it has to continue to 
beat quality teams like Michigan 
State and Ohio State. They can’t 
be satisfied with these victories. 
It has to perform well at the Big 
Ten Tournament and make its 
first NCAA tournament in five 
years. 

But Thursday showed Barnes 

Arico and the Wolverines are 
on the trajectory of figuring out 
their Achilles heel.

MDining’s quest for sustainability

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 24, 2018

Mondays, meatless no more


P

resident 
Donald 
Trump 

unexpectedly set off a political 
firestorm when he allegedly 

used a vulgar term to describe places 
like Haiti and Africa during a debate on 
immigration. The response was swift, 
with the president’s critics lambasting him 
for racism while his allies tried to frame it 
as something else, like White House press 
secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did last 
week.

“Look, no one here is going to pretend 

like the president is always politically 
correct. He isn’t. I think that’s one of the 
reasons the American people love him,” 
Sanders said. “One of the reasons that he 
won and is sitting in the Oval Office today 
is he isn’t a scripted robot. He tells things 
like they are sometimes, and sometimes he 
does use tough language.”

I would find it regretful if the President 

of the United States actually used the 
term; anyone with a conscience would call 
it racist. However, when vulgar language 

becomes an issue of political correctness 
rather than an issue of racism, it enters a 
muddy field.

It reminded me of a quote that I’ve kept 

near and dear to my heart from my days 
as a rookie reporter. At a multiculturalism 
and diversity panel hosted by a student 
feminist organization I covered freshman 
year, the host asked the panelists to define 
“political correctness.” What came out, 
I believe, was something that is often 
overlooked; that political correctness, at its 
core, is about respecting the other person 
and not protecting one’s own image.

“Unfortunately, a lot of people are more 

concentrated about being called racist, 
being called sexist or giving off a bad 
image than they are about really hurting 
somebody,” the panelist said.

In this “s***hole” controversy, the 

debate is whether Trump’s view could 
be discredited on the basis of his racist 
remarks (he did say he wanted more 
immigrants from Norway, after all), or 

whether liberals are overreacting to a 
president who slipped up while trying to 
tackle a thorny and complex issue that 
not even Democrats want to take head on. 
In the wider world, we must ask whether 
political correctness really stifles free 
speech and how we can discern between 
controversial ideas and outright bigotry.

Encyclopedia 
Britannica 
defines 

political correctness as “language that 
seems intended to give the least amount 
of offense, especially when describing 
groups identified by external markers 
such as race, gender, culture, or sexual 
orientation.”

The word has its roots in Marxist-

Leninist vocabulary, but its modern sense 
originates from philosopher Allan Bloom’s 
1987 book “The Closing of the American 
Mind.” In it, Bloom criticized universities 
for what he perceived as sacrificing open 
debate and discussion to not offend 
certain 
groups. 
Political 
correctness 

joined the lexicon of the greater Culture 

Wars throughout the 90s, 
wherein 
conservatives 

attacked 
liberals 
and 

higher education for what 
they saw the other side’s 
growing 
intolerance 

toward 
controversial 

ideas.

There 
have 
been 

numerous 
instances 

Bloom would point to as 
proof of his argument. A 
speaker was disinvited 
at Syracuse University 
for 
the 
outrage 
they 

may spark, or a class at 
Reed 
College 
became 

dysfunctional over claims 
that the content was 
racist. At the University of 
Michigan, 
controversial 

social scientist Charles 
Murray was interrupted 
by 
protesters 
who 

found his theory on the 
correlation between race 
and I.Q. repugnant.

Pundits from the left 

and right have argued 

against actions performed by college 
students like these essentially exclude those 
who are deemed as offensive from campus 
discourse. The direct and confrontational 
attitude of these protesters, as well as their 
refusal to compromise, have made them 
a favorite target of conservative pundits 
who point to them as proof that liberal 
student protesters are wielding political 
correctness as a weapon against opposing 
ideas.

But this isn’t what it’s supposed to 

be. Political correctness is meant to 
enable civil discourse in an increasingly 
multicultural society. Even the right 
benefits from their own form of political 
correctness – think religious freedom, 
“freedom fries,” “blue lives matter” and 
the like. If political correctness seems like 
something that stifles free speech, that 
means there are people abusing the word 
to their own advantage.

Nitpicking apart what your ideological 

enemies say and calling it oppression is not 
a way to start a conversation; it’s a bad way 
to persuade anyone except those who are 
already on your side. We must also learn to 
accept honest mistakes; I can tell you it’s 
not only white people who ask me where 
I’m “actually” from. As the philosopher 
Karl Popper said about accepting extreme 
arguments for political correctness:

“If we extend unlimited tolerance even 

to those who are intolerant, if we are not 
prepared to defend a tolerant society 
against the onslaught of the intolerant, 
then the tolerant will be destroyed, and 
tolerance with them,” Popper wrote in his 
book “The Open Society and its Enemies.”

So yes, there are legitimate ways to 

debate immigration in this country, and 
being tough is certainly an option. But 
Trump must recognize the humanity in 
the people he is going to affect, and calling 
entire countries “s***holes” is not a great 
start.

Ultimately, political correctness is about 

recognizing the weight your words carry 
in regard to history and institutions. But if 
our leaders can’t find the issue in the racist, 
colonialist and paternalistic attitudes 
inherent in “s***hole” and defend it on live 
television, maybe there’s a problem.

win. Thousands of fans flock to Ann 
Arbor, while college kids prepare for a 
day of revelry.

Now picture the game day reality: 

The weather sucks (it’s either too hot or 
too cold), our team is pretty average at 
this point, the streets are overcrowded 
and everything is sticky and smells like 
beer.

Before I start, I will admit I am a 

hypocrite on this matter. Over the past 
three football seasons, I have bought 
season tickets, attended tailgates and 
on occasion even made it to the actual 
game. However, I have decided to stop 
supporting what can only be described 
as the worst sport and let my true 
opinions out.

There are many issues I have with 

football, some of which are hard to 
dispute (like the physical implications 
for players), and others that many of you 
will blame on my lack of understanding 
of the game.

“You’re just a stupid girl who doesn’t 

get the culture of the True American 
Sport! Bah!” — some angry white man 
commenting on my article, probably.

Which, in many ways, is not wrong. 

I know very little about the rules of 
football and fill in stereotypes about 
my gender in that regard, but that does 
not mean my opinions on football are 
not valid.

It’s dangerous
I probably won’t be the first or 

the smartest person to tell you that 
football is incredibly dangerous for its 
players. Study after study detail the 
high risk of brain damage associated 
with the sport, especially among 
young players.

Yet for some reason, we still worship 

the sport. Football is still cool. The 
popular show Friday Night Lights 
(which I personally hated, but that’s 
another issue) literally had a main 
character paralyzed, but people still 
loved the program and the sport. 
Mind-boggling!

On campus, we worship football 

players and consistently encourage 
them to risk serious injury in the name 
of our entertainment. I’m sure gladiator 
fights were also sort of fun to watch if 
you got into it, but that doesn’t mean 
it should be condoned in a modern 
society. (Also, it should be noted that 
in the National Football League the 
majority of players are Black while the 
majority of viewers are white, so there 

are major systemic imbalances in who 
bears the costs of football.)

On this point, it is difficult to play 

devil’s advocate and argue against me 
that football is actually safe, but if you 
are looking for a fight, do not despair.

It’s boring
I understand why sports are fun. I 

love the passion people have for their 
teams, the cheers and the taunts. 
Personally, the Blues Brother dance 
after the third quarter is one of my 
favorite traditions at the University. 
However, this does not mean football 
should be the outlet of our enthusiasm 
for athletics.

I went to a basketball game for the 

first time this semester and, wow — 
what a good time! You still get to do the 
cheers (and the dance), but you don’t 
have to spend four hours outdoors.

Why does a football game have to 

take four hours? That is way too long 
in my opinion, and there’s too much 
downtime, with actual play time 
amounting to a mere 11 minutes total on 
average. Other sports like basketball, 
hockey and soccer have more constant 
action, making them much more 
interesting than football.

Also why the heck is Michigan 

football outdoors? Why do people want 
to brave the elements for four whole 
hours? This year alone, Michigan 
football 
attendees 
suffered 
from 

sunburn, pouring rain and freezing 
temperatures. I will admit that the Mr. 
Brightside moment in the rain looked 
like good fun, but does three minutes 
of iconic music make up for four hours 
of shivering? I would say no.

It’s overrated
While I was not a great football 

attendee (though I had season tickets, 
I only made it to three games, two of 
which I left before the first quarter), I 
managed to make it to most tailgates. 
Each game day I would wake up excited 
but consistently end up disappointed.

Again, why do they have to be 

outdoors? What do you do if it rains? 
(Apparently put up tarps or just let 
yourself get wet but personally, ew? 
Why would I want to do that?) The 
other half of the time it’s freezing cold, 
and you have to either wear tons of 
layers and cover up your bomb outfit 
or simply give up on being warm for 
the day and risk hypothermia. On 
the flip side, there are days when it is 
extremely hot and you end up sweaty, 
sunburnt and dangerously dehydrated.

Even if the weather is perfect, 

tailgates tend to be a net negative. Sure, 
the few hours you spend dancing can 
be a lot of fun, but the weird hours and 

postgame hangover make it generally 
unpleasant. For noon games, you have 
to wake up earlier than I do for my 
classes and pretend to be happy about 
it. Then following a day of tailgating 
and watching the game (for those of 
you who make it there and watch the 
whole thing), you eventually arrive 
home feeling like shit and just wanting 
some food and a long nap.

Additionally, the post-game nap is a 

very tricky thing to manage. Depending 
on the time of the game, it can really 
mess up your whole day. If you sleep 

too long, you could end up waking up 
at a time you would normally go to bed. 
Or you may wake up at a somewhat 
normal hour but still be hungover and 
have no energy to do anything else that 
day.

Despite the disruption and the 

general 
unpleasantness, 
we 
still 

commit to this tradition almost every 
other weekend in the fall, all for a sport 
that really isn’t worth the attention.

Perhaps we should take notes from 

other countries and obsess over the 
true football: soccer.

MDining’s quest for sustainability

Mondays, meatless no more

E

ven when I still ate meat, 
I loved Meatless Monday. 
Saying this is much like a 
middle school student who 

openly admits to enjoying school. For 
one day, the University of Michigan’s 
East Quad Residence Hall’s dining 
hall removed meat from the premises 
and served all vegetarian and vegan 
dishes. Given the challenge, the menu 
renounced its standard meat-and-pota-
to options and served dishes like falafel 
pitas and vegan pot pie.

Unfortunately, I’m probably alone in 

saying that. Most of my peers would 
do anything to avoid Meatless Monday. 
Even my friends who lived in East Quad 
would forgo convenience and trudge 
through rain or snow to South Quad 
Residence Hall’s dining hall. On the 
other days of the week, East Quad was 
almost always packed to capacity, forc-
ing students to awkwardly share tables 
with strangers. But this flock of car-
nivores migrating away every Monday 
guaranteed a barren dining hall filled 
with a glut of seating options.

In recent years, the University as 

a whole has struggled to meet its own 

goals to reduce both waste and green-
house gas emissions. Using measure-
ments in 2006 as the baseline, the goal 
was to reduce waste by 40 percent, 
to 7,900 tons. Not only has it failed to 
do so, but it has moved in the opposite 
direction: In 2016, waste totaled 14,100 
tons, nearly 1,000 more than 2006. And 
although the University has made more 
progress reducing greenhouse gases, it 
is still 132,000 metric tons short of its 
goal.

Nevertheless, there was little trans-

parency when MDining silently aban-
doned Meatless Monday this past fall, 
causing great confusion that a quick 
Google search couldn’t fix. I thought, 
perhaps, the meat-eaters student lobby 
grew too strong to be ignored — that, 
or Tyson Foods donated $100 million 
to the School for Environment and Sus-
tainability to fund a sustainable food 
program given that MDining exclusively 
serves chicken. Granted, I’m definitely 
the only person on campus who spends 
their free time thinking about potential 
Meatless Monday conspiracy theories.

The reality is more straightforward: 

Meatless Monday was always about sus-

tainability, and MDining felt there were 
more effective measures to promote 
this rather than getting rid of meat in 
one dining hall only to have students 
migrate to meat-serving locations. So, in 
fall 2017 and without fanfare, Sustain-
able Monday took over campus-wide.
I

t’s possible that student back-
lash won MDining over. In a 
column published by The Daily 
in 2015 — titled “Meatless Mon-

days of indoctrination” — Ashley Austin 
wrote Meatless Monday eliminated stu-
dents’ freedom to choose whether or not 
to eat meat.

“The notion in itself that students’ 

access to meat should be limited over-
steps a previously established bound-
ary,” she wrote.

This sent a strong message to the 

University community: Students don’t 
like having meat taken away, and they 
will be heard. Despite my affinity for 
Meatless Monday, some of the criticism 
was warranted. There were days when 
the menus included all of the typical 
meat dishes, but with flimsy fake-meat 
swapped in. 

Elliott Rains, marketing coordinator 

of MDining, and Keith Soster, direc-
tor of Student Engagement of MDin-
ing, denied Meatless Monday had been 
a flop, stating that the new initiative 
seeks to be more impactful.

“I think one of the biggest pushbacks 

we got with Meatless Monday was 
that we were taking something away 
from people,” Rains said. “Reintroduc-
ing meat in some capacity on a Mon-
day makes it more accessible to people 
… And if you can eat something that’s 
healthy and good for you one day of the 
week, then maybe that will build posi-
tive behaviors.”

To me, this seemed like a peculiar jus-

tification. Livestock contributes to 14.5 
percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, 
more than automobiles. Cutting back on 
meat altogether is one of the most effec-
tive ways to mitigate climate change 
and promote sustainability. If serving 
meat is unsustainable, then why, in fos-
tering sustainability, would you choose 
to do so?

Yet, Soster believes MDining is play-

ing its part in reducing waste and not 
contributing to the upward trend.

All dining halls implement 100 per-

cent pre-consumer composting, which 
takes the remains of unused foods, like 
carrot peels and watermelon rinds, and 
allows them to decompose naturally. 
To complement this, MDining began 
using compostable food packaging in 
all its facilities. Even though one-third 
of campus-wide waste is food, this also 
includes units outside of the dining 
halls, like office kitchens, according to 
Soster.

“We’re the biggest department in stu-

dent life and one of the biggest ones on 
campus,” Soster said. “We have not only 
a responsibility to lead, but to give great 
examples … If we model the behavior, 
we’re hoping that others will follow.”
T

he pinnacle of MDining’s 
sustainability 
efforts, 

which expand beyond Mon-
days, lies just seven miles 

northeast of Central Campus.

Starting in fall 2017, MDining began 

buying food from the Campus Farm 
and using it in dining halls. This is 
a clear step toward fulfilling Planet 
Blue’s sometimes-vague goal of creat-
ing a more sustainable campus. Since 
the farm received its Good Agricul-
tural Practices certificate, it has sold 
8,500 pounds of food to MDining in one 
semester alone, according to LSA junior 
Connor Kippe, Business and Projects 
Manager of the Campus Farm.

When I visited the Campus Farm ear-

lier this January, it was hard to imag-
ine sprawling tomato plants and other 
lush summertime vegetables growing 
— a thick layer of snow and sub-zero 
temperatures didn’t quite set the scene. 
Regardless, they grow cold weather-
friendly spinach and kale during the 
winter months. In the fall, they store 
squash, beets and other root vegetables 
to continue selling in the offseason.

Kippe began working for the Campus 

Farm about a year ago. He works with 
nine other students on the farm who 
serve different roles curated to their 
own specific interests.

Kippe’s interest in the farm grew after 

taking classes about the impact of food 
on the environment and people, which 
inspired him to begin volunteering prior 
to his first day on the job. Regarding the 
switch from Meatless Mondays to Sus-
tainable Mondays, Kippe said there was 
a slightly heated response from vegan 

students at the University.

“I am for whatever is pragmatic,” 

Kippe, a vegetarian himself, added. “If 
doing sustainable Monday everywhere 
at most of the cafes reduces the amount 
of meat (consumption) more so than 
doing just meatless Monday, then I’m a 
fan of it.”

Kippe also serves as a student ambas-

sador for Planet Blue. I worried Planet 
Blue was the University’s mechanism 
of greenwashing; ploys that appear to 
promote sustainability without actually 
doing so. Despite the University’s luke-
warm improvement with regard to sus-
tainability, Kippe maintains Planet Blue 
is much more than a mere buzzword to 
promote sustainability.

“It’s easy to make that claim that 

Planet 
Blue 
is 
only 
greenwashing 

because lots of the things Planet Blue 
does are behind the scenes, so it doesn’t 
appear that they’re doing things even 
when they are,” he said. “The Univer-
sity’s actually trying to move in differ-
ent areas. Though, it’s having different 
success at different things.”

As for the farm’s future, Kippe pre-

dicts it will continue to grow in the 
upcoming years, potentially doubling in 
size.

“I also see us doing more educational 

work, more vocational work — this has 
given me a lot of experience for things 
that I can go and do and change in the 
future in the environmental field,” 
Kippe said. “And for my coworkers, it 
has as well.”

According to Kippe, more important 

than the farm itself is the culture it 
breeds.

“We’re creating people who are more 

able to make that change and more … 
we’re both increasing the amount of 
people in that work and also how good 
they are at doing it,” he said.

Inside one of the main greenhouse 

units, containers with microgreens — 
the equivalent of green gold due to their 
high value — are lined up side-by-side. 
30 volunteers accompany me, all helping 
plant and grow products like the micro-
greens.

LSA freshman Kellee Byard is one of 

these frequent volunteers.

“I really like meeting the new people 

that volunteer here because we’re all 
like-minded — we all like working with 
plants, the outdoors and getting our 
hands dirty,” Byard said. “I’ve done har-
vesting, we do the planting… (and) help-
ing with maintenance. It’s all fun work 
in my opinion.”

She said what makes her time spent 

at the farm most fulfilling is the impact 
she sees, and eats, on campus.

“Sometimes in the dining hall, I’ll see 

a certain fruit or veggie … that I know 
we had worked with — harvesting spin-
ach, for example,” she said. “Seeing that 
in the dining halls is super cool, and 
knowing not having to get it imported 

from somewhere far away … You’re help-
ing the environment in the sense that 
it’s local, it’s something done by stu-
dents here at Michigan.”

Annually, 300 to 400 others like 

Byard volunteer at the farm. Friends of 
the Campus Farm, a student-run orga-
nization, organizes the volunteers inde-
pendently.

Campus 
Farm 
Manager 
Jeremy 

Moghtader said there has recently been 
more student engagement on the farm, 
he believes is due to the collaboration 
with MDining.

“I’ve been impressed that U-M and 

MDining is sourcing almost now 17.8 
percent sustainable and local product 
into the halls,” he said. “These folks 
are taking whole beets, roasting them 
and slicing them to put on the salad bar. 
That kind of culinary care for taking the 
locally grown beet and preparing it like 
that shows a real passion and dedica-
tion towards sustainability and towards 
delicious food.”

Moghtader highlighted the multifac-

eted effects of food and said it is rele-
vant in everyday life.

“Food sits at this nexus of all of these 

really important environmental and 
social issues, whether it’s public health, 
the economy, climate change, biodi-
versity … All of those things are really 
impacted by the food system,” Moghtad-
er said.

As for the future of sustainability on 

campus, he is optimistic; he views the 
farm as an educational opportunity and 
source of inspiration for all.

“Having students be hopeful about 

this farm and sustainability on campus I 
think is knowing that people can engage 
and learn about the food system,” he 
said. “They can engage in it meaning-
fully… (not) just learn about it in the 
classroom but learn about it in a way 
that allows them to contribute directly 
to the institution’s sustainability.”
A

bout 9 percent of Ameri-
cans adults are vegetarian, 
according to Pew Research. 
The vegetarian population 

at the University is also small, but none-
theless passionate. LSA senior Aaron 
Brodke leads the Michigan Animal 
Respect Society (MARS), which creates 
a community for vegetarians on campus. 
Without speaking on behalf of everyone 
in MARS, Brodke explained his organi-
zation’s views toward the change from 
Meatless Monday.

“Since the change happened from one 

dining hall to the entire group of dining 
halls at the University, this could poten-
tially be a big opportunity that MARS 
would support because it continues the 
sustainability message around food, 
which for the first few years were really 
just centered around one dining hall,” 
Brodke said.

For MARS, it’s a mixed bag — it sup-

ports the wide scope of Sustainable 

Monday, while questioning the lack of 
transparency on the decision to ax its 
meatless predecessor.

“Right now there may not be as much 

clarity around what the university, or 
MDining, means around Sustainable 
Mondays, so there is some backlash 
from members that may feel that it is 
somewhat regressive by adding animal 
products back to the menus,” Brodke 
said. “Once definitions become more 
clear, it could present a good opportu-
nity for more sustainable food systems 
change at the University of Michigan.”

LSA junior Jacalyn Webster has been 

a vegan for four years. Although she is 
still relatively new to the University, 
this change from a meatless to less-meat 
standard perplexed her.

“If you’re going to call something 

sustainable, and still serve meat, they 
should be saying why meat is not a 
sustainable option,” Webster said. “If 
they’re still going to put it out, use that 
as an educational opportunity to inform 
people of what they’re eating.”

As for the switch to sourcing locally 

grown food from the Campus Farm, 
Webster viewed this as a feat.

“The closer your food is to home, the 

more sustainable and environmentally 
friendly that is.”
A

t first, MDining’s decision 
to ditch my beloved Meat-
less Monday was unsettling. 
In an age where greenwash-

ing is so pertinent, I worried this was 
nothing more than a PR campaign. Call-
ing it “Sustainable” Monday, while still 
serving meat, is like driving a gas guz-
zling truck that happens to be a hybrid 

— it’s clearly still fuel inefficient, but at 
least it’s labeled “eco-friendly.”

However, it’s clear this isn’t entirely 

the case. Despite these negative trends 
throughout the University, MDining is 
playing its part in improving the health 
of ecosystems and communities, one of 
Planet Blue’s goals created in 2011.

After my beloved dog Charlie passed 

away, I started feeling guilt anytime 
I ate meat. It was conflicting to be so 
heartbroken by the death of a dog, yet 
happily eat a bacon cheeseburger. Even-
tually, this guilt overcame me: I ditched 
meat altogether in September 2016.

Honoring 
Charlie’s 
spirit 
wasn’t 

the only factor that led to this change. 
My older brother and best friend — 
both longtime vegetarians — had been 
encouraging me for months to experi-
ment with a meatless diet. Although 
admittedly lame, the biggest source of 
inspiration came from trying to impress 
a girl I had a crush on with our “shared 
life choices.”

Since then, what has kept me from 

reverting back to my omnivorous ways 
is the meat industry’s devastating con-
tributions to climate change. I can now 
put my guilty conscience to ease; at the 
very least, I feel less guilty about some-
times taking showers that last a few 
minutes too long.

I’ll do my part in preserving human-

kind’s longevity. Being vegetarian is by 
no means a get-out-of-jail-free card. I 
can’t then drive a Hummer and leave 
lights unnecessarily on all day. But it 
definitely helps.

And, it pays respect to my late, dear 

friend (Rest in peace, Charlie).

King of the Road

W

e hadn’t made it to the 
first 
stop 
sign 
before 

my mom made me do 

something not fun.

“Stop! Go back and put your helmet 

on.”

Fine. I went back into the garage, 

got my helmet –– which was just a 
normal bike helmet, and not even one 
of the cool skater helmets –– and put 
it on.

Now 
blissfully 
free 
from 

interruptions, 
my 
family 
and 
I 

continued on our bike ride, and 
got about twice as far before I was 
interrupted by an protruding tree 
branch. I flipped completely over my 
handlebars and landed squarely on my 
now-helmeted head.

For that I say, “Thanks, Mom.” 

Fast forward 10 years and, because 
I am ungrateful swine, I never wear 
my helmet –– for which I say, “Sorry, 
Mom! (And dad).”

Since coming to college, biking 

has turned from something I did 
occasionally on weekends with my 
family or as part of clandestine 
midnight outings into how I get 
anywhere and everywhere. And the 
recklessness has not been tempered; 
the wipeouts have only become more 
frequent.

Some of them are attributable 

purely to my own stupidity. One night, 
when I got hungry at 2 a.m., as one 
tends to get, I made the logical choice 
of going to Jimmy John’s: a relatively 
healthy, very appetizing and very 
open restaurant! Being 2 a.m., the 
roads were completely clear, making 
it a perfect time to figure out just 
how fast I could get my bike to turn. 
Slaloming between potholes, feeling 
perfectly confident, I quickly found 
out –– and in a swift, sweeping motion 
was on the pavement with little birds 
flying in circles around my head. 
Luckily, the roads were completely 
clear.

Other times are less pure stupidity 

and more stupid obstinacy. It was the 
first day of the winter semester last 
year, but I’d be damned if I let the 
weather force me to waste 17 minutes 
of my valuable time walking to class 
instead of biking. The road conditions 
weren’t ideal for my thin, traction-
less tires, but they were good enough. 
Biking cut the 17-minute stretch 
between my house and the MLB to 
five, so needless to say, I was feeling 

rather good about myself as I rolled 
up to my 10 a.m. Spanish class.

Just one more curb to go.
The curb ramp, however, had just 

a little too much snow packed on it, 
and my self-satisfaction turned into 
shame, disgust and annoyance at the 
dozens of students who had decided 
to walk to their 10 a.m. classes at the 
MLB and were now concerned if I, 
now on the ground instead of on my 
bike, was OK.

“Haha, I’m fine. I’m fine.”
Stop looking at me!
And then –– and then, there are the 

rare times which are a combination 
of stupidity, obstinacy and neglect. 
After subjecting my bike to years of 
highly regular use, it has begun to 
deteriorate; tape peels off, screws 
come loose, that sort of thing, nothing 
that can’t be fixed at a bicycle repair 
shop. In September, though, the 
seat began wobbling, which is never 
something you want, and sometimes 
the wobbling got quite vicious. I found 
a reliable, albeit temporary, solution 
in just twisting the screw underneath 
the seat tight, either with my hands 
or with an Allen wrench. It would 
only take a few hours or days and 
the seat would start wobbling again. 
A temporary solution was more than 
good enough for me, though.

One night, I was coming home 

from a long and unproductive three 
hours at the library, the studious 
student that I am. The seat was barely 
wobbling, and so I felt it was safe to 
ride with no hands (a talent I hadn’t 
developed until coming to college) as 
I was approaching my house.

Just one more curb to go.
This 
curb 
ramped 
up 
at 
a 

particularly steep angle. I had always 
used some caution when biking over 
it in the past, and would stand up on 
the pedals, butt hovering above the 
seat, both hands on the handlebars. 
Maybe this time, though, I should do 
it sitting down, no hands. To prove 
wrong all who had doubted me.

Though you’ve probably guessed by 

now, what happened next was actually 
a little more exciting than a standard 
wipeout. The bearings holding the 
seat in place, as I found out a couple 
of weeks later at the bike repair shop, 
had rusted out quite a bit. And so, 
when I took that curb all seat and no 
hands, I put a lot of pressure on those 
poor little bearings. Eschewing any 

regard for my well-being, the seat 
detached itself from the rest of the 
bike and flew backward, taking me 
with it. Already having gone several 
weeks failing to repair the seat, I went 
a couple more completely missing 
one, forced to ride standing up, both 
hands on the handlebars at all times. 
A fitting punishment.

And, because symmetry is life’s idea 

of humor, this year Mother Nature 
made it so all the New Year’s snow 
had melted and refrozen over every 
sidewalk on campus for the winter 
semester’s first Monday. One year had 
passed since my most shameful fall. 
The flashbacks I got from going up 
curbs had subsided almost completely. 
Mother Nature thought she could cow 
me into submission. It was time to let 
old things die.

At least that time I wasn’t in front 

of the MLB. I got up and back on my 
bike before anyone was within talking 
distance.

All of this is to say, I guess, that I 

will never learn my lesson! I will keep 
biking to class every day, and I will 
not go any slower, haters. And I won’t 
wipe out ever again.

Maybe it’s okay that I don’t wear 

a helmet, since I’m so hardheaded 
about biking already. And maybe this 
isn’t the case, but part of what biking 
is to me is my imagination that every 
other biker is just as hardheaded. I do 
feel superior to you, in case you were 
wondering, walkers. My bike goes 10 
times faster than you, and is greener 
and more mobile than a car or moped.

I could be compensating. Again, 

maybe it’s just my flawed perception, 
but bikers –– especially those who 
bike through the winter –– are kind of 
a class of social outcasts. Like walking 
is just normal, and biking is “extra.” 
Let me know if you know what I’m 
talking about, reader.

All of that, whether it’s going 

on in my head or not, just adds to 
the camaraderie I feel with other 
bikers –– especially those who bike 
through the winter. And so I hope my 
children, when I have them, want me 
to teach them to ride a bike, and that 
biking again becomes something I do 
occasionally on weekends with my 
family. Don’t worry –– I’ll make them 
wear helmets.

for many of us on campus.

I had it all together in high school. 

I put effort into everything I involved 
myself in, certainly, but I always 
received what I wanted: an A in a class, 
a raise, a well-done project or 
an emotional boost. As long as 
I tried, I achieved my desired 
perfection. I did not know my 
high school had been on the 
list of the worst performing 
schools in Michigan until 
I graduated, but even if I 
had, I doubt that would have 
scared my younger self when 
preparing for my transition to 
college.

I came to Michigan knowing 

I would be challenged by 
thousands of great minds, 
many my age. I felt ready, 
and was excited whenever 
I thought about my new 
“Victors 
2021” 
identity 
— 

especially 
inserting 
the 

hashtag into my Twitter and 
Instagram bios. I thought I 
knew what I was getting into, 
and felt extremely ready. “It 
won’t be that bad,” I believed.

I quickly realized that I 

didn’t know what I was doing.

I was challenged beyond 

what I felt my brain capacity 
allowed 
academically, 

mentally 
and 
emotionally. 

Mentally 
and 
physically, 

I 
experienced 
complete 

drainage.

And to make things worse, 

I believed I was the only 
freshman who felt this way. 
My sanity felt as though it had 
been stretched so thin, like 
how a rubber band loses its 
elasticity each time you use it, 
until eventually it just snaps.

Everyone else seemed to 

have 
their 
academic 
and 

social lives together; good 
grades, friend groups, club 
acceptances and everything else I 
couldn’t attain. While my consistent 
lack of self-confidence didn’t aid in 
these 
frustrations 
I 
experienced, 

I couldn’t understand what I was 
doing wrong. I kept my nose in my 
books while maintaining the balance 
of seeing friends, writing for The 
Daily and attending a party when 
I could. I tried to get enough sleep 

because I cannot function without 
my eight hours. I checked every detail 
of my resume as I sent it to clubs or 
companies. I did everything everyone 
else was doing, and perhaps even 
more.

Yet, I was struggling to get where I 

wanted while everyone else seemingly 
zoomed past me.

“Why am I struggling even when I 

put so much time into everything I do? 
Why was I even accepted here?”

Many nights, I cried into my pillow 

with these recurring thoughts. I 
couldn’t understand why I felt I was 
doing so horribly. I felt I was learning 
more in a semester than I felt I had 
learned in four years of high school. 
Yet, when the time came around, I 
became lucky if I earned an average 

grade, even though I had prepared 
more than many people I knew. My 
peers went to me asking for help 
with course material, yet they earned 
higher grades than I did. No matter 
what I did, I was not enough.

But, with this, my soul still felt 

lost. I worked my ass off but wasn’t 
rewarded like I was in high school. I 
read my textbooks, went to class and 

office hours, participated and studied. 
I put the time into my academic 
relationship with school. All of this 
occurring while I slipped further 
into the cracks of lacking self-worth 
and confusion of whether I belonged 
at this school. I loved Michigan but 
thought Michigan didn’t love me.

I remember telling my mom in 

many tearful phone conversations 

that I wanted to drop out. I wasn’t 
good enough for Michigan. I put my 
academics first yet seemed like I 
always finished last. I believed I had 
failed myself. Others had everything 
they could ever want, and I was 
struggling to make it through.

However, after sobbing to three 

friends about my stress when they 
rushed to my room because they saw 

my face soaked with tears 
in the hall, I realized that 
many students felt like I did. 
They were also exhausted, 
lost 
and 
confused. 
They 

experienced insecurity about 
their academic readiness, and 
began to blame themselves for 
it, similarly to me. Even those 
who I perceived to “have it 
all” here at Michigan, came 
forward to me that they felt 
opposite of the image they 
tried to portray.

I suddenly didn’t feel alone 

or susceptible to self-blame.

I also reflected on the 

positive experiences of my 
first semester. Football games, 
study sessions that involved 
more laughing than studying, 
numerous 
Grilledcheezerie 

macaroni sandwiches (I think 
some of the drivers know me by 
name), meeting amazing new 
friends, sledding with laundry 
baskets, having a squirrel in 
my dorm, midnight walks 
through Nichols Arboretum, 
getting lost on North Campus 
while 
walking 
back 
from 

buying Little Caesars and 
other nights that I can’t talk 
about in this article continue 
to be some of many wonderful 
memories.

Through just one semester, 

I learned an important lesson: 
If I’m putting in my best 
effort, then the result that 
comes out of this is all I can 
do, and that’s okay.

We can’t expect ourselves 

to perform more than we are 
capable of. We will not be 
able to solve complex math 

problems when we haven’t learned 
how to solve basic problems. We 
won’t be able to accomplish goals if 
we are not capable of accomplishing 
them yet. It took me 18 years to learn 
this, but thank God I finally did. This 
experience saved my sanity.

My freshman bubble had been 

popped, but with it came a healthier 
and happier me.
