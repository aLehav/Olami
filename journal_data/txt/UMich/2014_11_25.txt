Dr. Marschall Runge,
dean of UNC School
of Medicine, to take
executive role
By IAN DILLINGHAM

University President Mark
Schlissel named his nomination
for a new leader of the University
of Michigan Health System Mon-
day. Dr. Marschall Runge has
been recommended to lead medi-
cal affairs at the University, pend-
ing approval by the University's
Board of Regents at their regular-
ly scheduled meeting on Dec. 18.
Runge currently serves as
executive dean for the School
of Medicine at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
If approved, he will take over
the position of executive vice
president of medical affairs
March 1. University spokesperson
Rick Fitzgerald confirmed that
Schlissel met with Runge prior to
making the recommendation.
"Dr. Runge has significant
experience and success in mul-
tiple aspects of healthcare and
academic health sciences,"
Schlissel said in a press release.
"His accomplishments as a scien-

tist, physician and leader are ide-
ally suited to advance the UMHS
tripartite mission of clinical care,
education and research."
Runge currently serves as
director of the North Carolina
Translational and Clinical Sci-
ences Institute, a partnership
between the University of North
Carolina and several other insti-
tutions which aims to "acceler-
ate clinical and translational
research from health science."
He earned a bachelors of arts
in biology and Ph.D. in molecular
biology from Vanderbilt Universi-
ty and a medical degree from the
Johns Hopkins University.
If appointed, he will take con-
trol of one of the University's
largest operations.
UMHS includes the Univer-
sity hospitals and health centers,
the medical and nursing schools,
along with a large portion of the
University's biomedical research
centers. Its operating activities
accounted for over $3 billion for
the 2014 fiscal year - 45 percent
of the University's total opera-
tions.
When Ora Pescovitz stepped
down from her role as CEO of thy.:
University of Michigan Health
System in June, a search com-
mittee began to seek her replace-
ment. Dr. Paul Lee, director of the
Kellogg Eye Center, chaired the
committee.

University releases first
sexual misconduct report

Reported incidents
rise to 129 during
first year of new
Title IX policy
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Following revisions to its Stu-
dent Sexual Misconduct Policy in
2012, the University has released
its first annual report devoted
exclusively to incidents of sexual
misconduct, which have been
reported at an increasing rate in
the last four years.

The report provides details
of the 129 reported incidents of
potential sexual misconduct this
year and how those proceedings
werehandled.
"Since this is our first report,
ourinterestismakingsure thatit's
useful to the campus community,
especially for our students," said
Anthony Walesby, the University's
Title IX coordinator and associate
vice provost for academic and fac-
ulty affairs. "Students can read it
and look at the information, and
say, 'OK, this would have been
more helpful had you presented
it this way or if there were more
hyperlinks,' or whatever it might
be - that will be useful for us to

know."
In previous years, the data was
published annually by the Office
of Student Conflict Resolution as
a subsection of its larger report
concerning all forms of student
complaints, violations, resolu-
tions and sanctions. This year, the
Office of Institutional Equity, in
accordance with the University's
new sexual misconduct policy,
published this independent report
separate from the OSCR data.
The University's new policy
was implemented in August 2013
following the two-year interim
policy that was put in place in
August 2011. The interim policy
came as aresponse to a "Dear Col-

league" letter issued by the U.S.
Department of Education recom-
mending that universities update
their procedures for handling
such incidents.
Most notably, the new policy
amended the burden of proof
required for finding a person
responsible for allegations of
sexual misconduct. The Univer-
sity previously practiced a higher
"clear and convincing" standard.
Under the new policy, cases are
decided based on a "prepon-
derance of evidence," which in
practice means the standard of
evidence that is more likely than
not an incidence ofsexual miscon-

Department
School of Public
Health to provide
new way to for

By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily Staff Reporter
On Thursday, the University's
Board of Regents approved the
creation of the Department of
Nutritional Sciences within the
School of Public Health.
Currently, there are three
existing pathways available to
graduate students interested
in nutrition that are offered
through the Public Health
School's Human Nutrition Pro-
gram. These three programs
are being moved from their cur-
rent home in the Public Health
School's Department of Environ-
mental Health Sciences to the
new Department of Nutritional
Sciences effective July 1, 2015.
Susan Aaronson, environmen-
tal health sciences lecturer, said
the Master of Public Health pro-
gram will stay largely the same,
but will become more tailored
to nutrition rather than environ-
mental health.

slightly different is a couple of

Fundraising drive
to aid Victors for
Michigan goal of
$4 billion by 2018
ByEMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
Next Tuesday is about to be a
whole lot more Blue.
The University aims to raise
$1 million next Tuesday, Dec. 2
through Giving Blueday, the first
University-wide one-day push for
donations as part of its current
major fundraisingcampaign,Vic-
tors for Michigan.
Tom Szczepanski, assistant
vice president for development,
connected Giving Blueday to Giv-
ingTuesday, a national movement
to promote charitable action after
mass consumption on Thanks-
giving, Black Friday and Cyber
Monday.
"Imagine how few nonprofit
organizations can claim that they
raised a million dollars in one
day," Szczepanski said. "I think
that our alumni and our students
and all the friends of the Univer-
sity are up for that sort of chal-
lenge."
The University is asking stu-
dents, alumni and friends of the
University to donate to an area of

their choice on Giving Blueday.
Some private donors have agreed
to match student donations; one
will match all student gifts up to
atotal of $30,000.
Szczepanski anticipates that
donorswilibe inspiredbycurrent
students and their organizations.
About 70 student groups, includ-
ing the Black Student Union,
Michigan Marching Band and the
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, will partici-
pate and encourage donors to give
money for their organizations.
"Nothing motivates the donor
more than looking at a young per-
son and saying, 'Wow, I want to
support people like that,"' Szcz-
epanski said. "By their participa-
tion in things like the campaign
kickoff, it really is the embodi-
ment of what they're providing
funds for, to support the students
that we have here."
To encourage participation,
there will be activities on cam-
pus throughout the day, includ-
ing an appearance by Olympic ice
dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie
White, both LSA students, and
a performance by the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance in the
Diag.
While much of the money
raised will go toward student
organizations, donors can also
direct their money toward schol-

COniN G lUNCKsE Lo
Bringing a diverse lens to film

Assistant Prof Colin Gunckel
is a historian of Latin American
cinema in the departments of
American Culture and ScreenArts
Et Cultures. He graduated from
the University of New Mexico
in 2002, completed his master's
in cinema and media studies at
the University of California, Los
Angeles in 2004 and received his
Ph.D.from UCLA in 2009.
Whatproject are you working
on now?
I have a book coming out
in in April; it's called "Mexico
on Main Street." It's a study of
Mexican film culture in Los
Angeles before World War II. It's

essentially looking at the ways in
whichthegrowth of the Mexican
population in Los Angeles, the
birth of Hollywood and the rise
of Mexican cinema are all related
to eachother. What Mexican film
culture in downtown Los Ange-
les, which included everything
from live theatre to newspaper
criticism to the exhibition of
films, how that was a place where
Hollywood and Mexican cinema
interacted.
What influenced you to get
involved in your field of
study?
I grew up in Central Texas and
learned Spanish at a pretty young

age. I just became more and more
interested in culture, literature,
art, Spanish-language music and
film. For my undergrad degree, I
decided to study Latin American
cinema and so I followed that
path and kind of became obsessed
with Mexican cinema, but in the
process of learning about that, I
became interested in the theaters
in the U.S. that showed Mexican
cinema. The people that I talked
to that were watching movies in
the 1940s and '50s sometimes
remembered the movies, but most
frequently remembered the expe-
rience of going to the theaters. I
wanted to write about that expe-
rience and that dimension of it.

Student-run pantry to
fight food insecurity

Survey says 40
percent of students
lack access to
nutricious food
By QUAN NGUYEN
For theDaily
As students put down security
deposits on a place to live next
year, many begin to think about
the realities of living off campus.
Beyond the costs of rent, utilities
and Internet access, managing
a food budget can be difficult,
especially when a minimum
two-term off-campus meal plan
costs $1,900.
According to a survey con-
ducted by the University student
organization Student Food Co.,
40 percent of University students
face food insecurity or a lack of

access to nutritious food.
Understanding that many
off-campus students face this
challenge, Business junior For-
est Burczak and Business sopho-
more Wesley Zhu launched the
University's first student-run
food pantry last year.
Both Burczak and Zhu are
members of the University's
chapter of Enactus, an inter-
national nonprofit that aims
to use entrepreneurship to
improve quality of life for those
in need.
After spending one semes-
ter pitching their idea to Food
Gatherers, a nonprofit food bank
in Ann Arbor, the project kicked
off in the Winter 2014 semester
with a pilot event at First Baptist
Church of Ann Arbor on East
Washington Street. Organizers
distributed food collected from
local grocery stores that would
have otherwise been wasted.

H--,0

The program attracted mostly
graduate students with chil-
dren.
The most recent food distribu-
tion event on Nov. 5 drew about
10 attendees, again mostly grad-
uate students.
Looking back on the first two
events, both students said they
are now focusing most of their
efforts on promoting their proj-
ect to the student body.
"We are working a lot on
marketing right now. We want
Diag flyers, get a Diag board
and also get them on bus signs,"
Zhu said.
Burczak said a social media
presence is also important.
"We made a page for the event
and we try to get enough people
to like it so that the next time, we
don't have to do flyers each time
we hold an event," he said.
During the first stage of their
project, Burczak and Zhu sought
advice from Nate Smith-Tyge,
founder and director of the
Michigan State University Food
Bank, the first student food pan-
try in the United States.
In an interview with USA
Today, Smith-Tyge said more
than 50 institutions of higher
education have programs that
distribute food to those in need.
Smith-Tyge said he rarely
encountered universities while
working with Burczak and Zhu
that weren't entirely supportive
of the projects.
However, Zhu said the group
experienced several challenges
implementing the project at the
University. He said the Office
of Financial Aid declined to list
the program in its newsletter
and the group had trouble find-
ing faculty members to support
the project.
Enactus maintains a goal of
holding two food distribution
events per month.. Organizers
are collaborating with Student
Food Co. to help them promote
the events, as well as with stu-
dent community service orga-

Governance board
discusses student-
athlete standards
behind closed doors
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily News Editor
As students and faculty alike,
count down the hours until
Thanksgiving Break, the Sen-
ate Advisory Committee for
University Affairs convened
for its weekly meeting in the
Regents .Room of the Fleming
Administration Building.
After status reports on a
number of continuing projects
and initiatives - including fit-
ness for duty standards for the
Advisory Board on Intercolle-
giate Athletics confidentiality'
agreement - were delivered,
SACUA delved into discussion
about the LSA Grievance Prot
cedures.
The discussion revolved
around the creation of a memo'

explaining the proposed pol-
icy, and the members deter-
mined that an explanation of
the existing policy will be pro-
vided. SACUA voted to endorse
the memo and invited LSA
faculty members to review the
grievance policy, provide feed-
back and provide a copy of the
memo to LSA Dean Andrew
Martin, per his request.
Following that decision,
SACUA member David Smith,
a John G. Wagner Collegiate
professor in the College of
Pharmacy, brought forth draft
statements related to the
responsibilities of individual
faculty members in the college
and potential corrective proce-
dures in the event of underper-
formance.
Though the agenda was
approved before the meeting
started, SACUA ultimately
decided to move the discussion
about admission standards for
student-athletes to the execu-
tive session, closing it off to
the public and members of
the press. While some mem-

bers thought an open discus-
sion was appropriate because
individual students' names
or information wouldn't be
divulged, SACUA member Sil-
ke-Maria Weineck, a professor
of German studies, motioned
to make the issue private after
receiving feedback from stu-
dent-athletes herself.
"I've had conversations
with a number of athletes
and they feel that the way
this is being discussed{always
includes all of them, and
they feel very hurt by certain
things that are being said,"
Weineck said. "I don't blame
them and I would like to avoid
that. There's been consider-
able harm to about 900 to
1,000 students and I would
like to not repeat that."
Due to internal scheduling
conflicts, SACUA unanimously
voted to cancel the meeting
they had previously scheduled
for Mon., Dec. 1, though the
group will session before the
meeting of the Senate Assem-
bly on Dec. 15.

Honda admits to
airbag defects
Honda is admitting that it
failed to report more than 1,700
injury and death claims about its
vehicles to U.S. safety regulators,
a violation of federal law.
The Japanese automaker, in
statements issued Monday, also
said it became aware of the omis-
sions in 2011, yet it took about
three years to take action.
The company said it filed doc-
uments detailing the lapses on
Monday with the National High-
way Traffic Safety Administra-
tion, which had demanded an
explanation on Nov. 3.
The agency said at the time
that Honda may have failed to
report incidents related to air
bags made by Takata Corp. as
well as other defective parts.
Honda has recalled more than
5 million vehicles in the U.S.
since 2008 to fix a potentially
fatal defect in air bags made by
Japanese auto supplier Takata.
The air bag inflators can rupture
after a crash and injure occu-
pants with shards of metal.

Darren Wilson in the death of
Michael Brown, the unarmed,

shooting sparked weeks of
sometimes-violent protests and
inflamed deep racial tensions
between many African-Ameri-
cans and police.
Moments after the announce-
ment by St. Louis County's top
prosecutor, crowds began pour-
ing into Ferguson streets to pro-
test the decision. Some taunted
police, broke windows and van-
dalized cars. Within a few hours,
several buildings were ablaze,
and frequent gunfire was heard.
Officers used tear gas to try to
disperse some of the gatherings.

Iran's nuclear talks
extended to July
A yearlong effort to seal a
nuclear deal with Iran fizzled
Monday, leaving the U.S. and its
allies little choice but to declare
a seven-month extension in
hopes that a new deadline will be
enough to achieve what a decade
of negotiations have failed to limit
Tehran's ability to make a nuclear
weapon.
Pushback from critics in Con-
gress followed almost immedi-
ately, with powerful Republicans
saying that Iran is merely trying
to buy time.
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry and other Western foreign
ministers defended the add-on
time as the best way forward.
"We would be fools to walk away,"
Kerry declared.

LISBON, Portugal
p Former P.M. sent
to prison for fraud
A judge sent former Portuguese
Prime Minister Jose Socrates
to prison Monday while the ex-
leader fights accusations of cor-
ruption, money-laundering and
tax fraud.
The judge decided after an ini-
tial hearing there was sufficient
police evidence to keep Socrates
in custody on preliminary charg-
es of wrongdoing, a court state-
ment said. Socrates's lawyer, Joao
Araujo, said his client denies the
charges and would appeal the
custody decision.
Under Portuguese law, the
public prosecutor will now inves-
tigate further before presenting
formal charges, a process that
could take more than six months.
A magistrate will then decide
whether to put Socrates on trial.
The crimes carry a maximum
sentence of 21 years.
But a week of tough maneuver-
ing appeared to have achieved lit-
tle more than agreement to keep
on talking. Negotiators will now
strive to nail down by March 1
what Iran and the six world pow-
U ers it is negotiating with must do,
and by when. A final agreement is
meant to follow four months later.

From Page 1
Dr. Michael Johns, former
Emory chancellor and execu-
tive vice president for health
affairs, has been serving as
interim Executive Vice Presi-
dent of Medical Affairs since
June 2. University spokesper-
son Rick Fitzgerald said Johns
has agreed to retain his interim
position until the transition date
of March 1.
The University enlisted the
services of Russell Reynolds
Associates, an international con-
sulting firm that serves a role in
executive searches, in the selec-
tion process. To collect feedback
and nominations from the medi-
cal community, the University
also hosted public forums with

UMHS faculty and staff and
other related groups during the
summer of 2014.
In a July University press
release, Schlissel outlined the
criteria for an ideal EVPMA.
He or she would need exten-
sive research leadership expe-
rience, have a medical or
equivalent degree and expe-
rience that reflects an abil-
ity to manage an institution like
UMHS.
"We'll need someone with a
good sense of trends in health
care, good business sense, a
commitment to quality care and
a real sensitivity to what faculty
and students need to be success-
ful," Schlissel said in a press
release.

arships and other areas of the
overall Victors for Michigan
campaign.
Victors for Michigan, which
began last November, is the Uni-
versity's sixth major fundraising
campaign and aspires to raise $4
billion by 2018. This fundraising
goal is the second-largest in pub-
lic institution history, surpassed
only by the $4.2 billion goal of
the University of California, Los
Angeles's Centennial Campaign.
Before the campaign began,
the University received $1.7 bil-
lion in gifts during a two-year
"silent phase," but after this past
year the campaign has raised a
total of $2.45 billion. So far, the

University has raised $418 mil-
lion of its goal of $1 billion for
student scholarships.
"We have a lot of very gen-
erous individuals that went to
Michigan and they feel good
about Michigan," said Jerry
May, vice president of develop-
ment. "That's what we're really
lucky about."
While the campaign started
under former University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman, May
said the campaign planned for a
transition in presidency and that
current University President
Mark Schlissel has been forming
relationships with prominent
donors and loyal alumni.
"He has totally embraced the
goals of the campaign," May
said. "Especially the scholarship
goal"

REPORT
From Page 1
duct took place.
This year's sexual misconduct,
report, which spans July 2013
to June 2014, describes the pro-
cedures students followed after
reporting an incident as a way of
educatingthe University aboutthe
new policy.
"In pulling this out separate
from the OSCR report, my hope is
that anybody who reads it - facul-
ty, staff, students, members of the
public - will be able to say, 'OK,
here is what happened in these
cases,"' Walesby said. "They were
alltakenveryseriously."
This year, students reported
129 issues of sexual misconduct,
including sexual assault, sexual
harassment and stalking, among
others. This is an increase from
the 83 reported in 2012-13, the 71
reported in 2011-12 and the nine
reported in2010-11.During2009-
10, onlyfourwere reported.
"The more reports, the bet-
ter," Walesby said. "Again, I wish
these things were not occurring,
but I think it's a healthy sign that
we have so manystudents who are
willing to come forward andshare
their experiences. So I think it's
a good thing in an otherwise bad
situation."
Walesby said the increased
reporting may requirethe Univer-
sity to hire additional investiga-
tors in the future.
Of the 129 reported incidents
this year, 68 were for sexual
assault, 34 for sexual harassment,
18 for stalking, two for retaliation
- actions taken against the com-
plainant for filing a complaint
and 11 classified as "other."
Twenty-seven of the 129 were
investigated by OIE, 48 went to a
review panel and 58 were deter-
mined to "not fall within the scope.
of the policy," according to the
report. This means that alleged
misconduct did not constitute
sexual misconduct, even if proven
true. In these instances, the report
says, appropriate steps were taken
for the complainant, such as a
referral to Counseling and Psy-
chological Services.
A review panel is formed when
it is initially unclear whether
investigation will be necessary
or possible given the information
available. The panel, made up of
University faculty and staff mem-
bers, reviews the situation and
offers advice about how to pro-
ceed to Walesby, who then deter-

mines to either close the case,
proceed with investigation or take
other interim measures.
"Interim measures" are imple-
mented to ensure the safety of the
campus community, specifically
the complainant. The report lists
the changing of academic sched-
ules and housing arrangements
as examples.
Of the 27 incidents investigated
by OIE, 11 were found to be viola-
tions. Fifteen resulted in rulings
of no violation and one was closed
without a finding.
The report details the severity
of discipline for students found to
have violated the University's sex-
ual misconduct policy after these
investigations.
According to Walesby, disci-
pline can entail educational out-
reach such as writing a reflective
essay and completing a reading
list. Discipline can also be more
severe, including temporary or
permanent separation from the
University, equal to expulsion
The report lists our incidents
in which the University placed a
student on disciplinary probation
for more than one year - twice
for non-penetrative sexual assault
and once for stalking and sexual
harassment.
One student was placed on dis-
ciplinary probation for less than
one year for stalking. In addition,
there were two instances of tem-
porary separation of greater than
oneyear for stalkingand non-pen-
etrative sexual assault.
One student was permanently
separated from the University,
which corresponds to a report in
The Michigan Daily that former
MichigankickerBrendanGibbons
was permanently separated from
the University after being found
responsible for sexual miscon-
duct.
Last month, an anonymous
group of survivors and allies held
a protest on the Diag in which
they directed seven demands to
the University for improving its
approachtosexualassaultoncam-
pus - including increased support
for survivors of sexual violence,
mandatory signs posted in every
Greek -and cooperative house
defining the definition of consent
and a mandatory training system
for incoming students regarding
sexual assault to be completed
before comingto campus. -
In addition, the University is
one of several institutions under
investigation by the Depart-
ment of Education's Office for
Civil Rights for allegations that it

committed Title IX violations by
failing to adequately respond to
instances of sexual misconduct.
An analysis by The Washington
Post in July reported that the Uni-
versity ranked second among the
universities in question in sexual
assaults between2010 and 2012.
"When I see those high report-
ing rates, I think to myself that's
one more student who has felt
comfortable in sharing the feel-
ing of harm and has connected to
the spectrum of resources," said
Holly Rider-Milkovich, director
of the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center,
in a July interview. "I am proud
of the reporting rate that we have
achieved."
The University's report on
sexual misconduct does not
list specific geographic trends
that might provide a pattern for
sexual misconduct activities on
campus, partly because the Uni-
versity is trying to maintain a
balance between maintaining the
privacy of complainants while
beingtransparent about what sex-
ual misconduct trends there are,
Walesby said.
"We're always looking for pat-
terns," Walesby said, noting that
students have pointed out spots on
campus that are particularly dark
at night. During an investigation,
OIE will often look to see ifa per-
son has been accused in the past,
and will connect those instances
to patterns of sexual misconduct
in certain residence halls or other
locations.
Each step of the process also
results in an evaluation that the
complainant and the accused
- which the report calls "the
respondent" - can appeal. In 70
percent of cases, there was no
appeal by either the complainant
or the respondent, according to
the report.
Walesby emphasized the
importance of a fair and thor-
oughprocess inwhichall involved
communicate separately with the
University while being given the
option to have a lawyer present,
appeal and remove or reinsert
themselves at any point.
Thisgoesfortherespondent,too.
"I know for the persons who
are accused it can be a very dif-
ficult time, so we have resources
as well," Walesby said. "We want
them to also feellike, 'OK, I would
rather not be in this situation, but
I do have confidence that the pro-
cess is fair, I do have confidence
that the process is thorough, that
my voice is heard."'


NUTRITION
From Page 1
the courses that are required for
the students to take are admin-
istered through our current
department, which is environ-
mental health sciences," Aar-
onson said. "Since it will now
be nutritional sciences, we will
focus on nutrition-related top-
ics."
Karen Peterson, professor of
environmental health scienc-
es and director of the Human
Nutrition Program, said faculty
members already have a few
new specializations in mind for
the new department, including
a focus on sustainable food sys-
tems. This initiative will be in
collaboration with the School of
Natural Resources and Environ-
ment, the Taubman College of
Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning and the Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology Department.
Peterson said cross-school col-
laboration will be a priority of
the Department of Nutritional
Sciences.
"We want to build in even more
flexibility into the programs than
we have now. Michigan in general
is known for having interdisci-
plinary opportunities," Peterson
said. "One of the areas that we've
been pushing into is sustainable
foods systems."
Peterson said the department
will also emphasize the relation-
ship between physical activity
and nutrition. To do this, Peter-
son said the department will
work with the School of Kinesi-
ology.
The third innovative aspect
of the program will be a con-
centration in maternal and child
nutrition. Peterson said this spe-
cialization is important because
it is a significant part of under-
standing health-related issues,
both in the United States and
globally.
While there are several
degrees available to graduate
students interested in nutrition,
there are currently few under-
graduate opportunities in this
field. Aaronson acknowledged
this creates an educational gap
in regard to undergraduate
opportunity.
"We recognize there's a tre-
mendous need at University of
Michigan to do more for our
undergraduates related to nutri=

tion."
Peterson said there is not cur-
rently a plan to add a nutrition
major to the undergraduate cur-
riculum, but faculty members do
hope to establish an undergrad-
uate course in the next couple of
years that will focus specifically
on nutrition.
Peterson said the Public
Health School also wants to gar-
ner more undergraduate appli-
cants in its LSA-SPH Sequential
4+1 Sequential Undergraduate/
Graduate Studies Program.
The SUGS 4+1 Program allows
undergraduate students inter-
ested in attending the Public
Health School to begin their
degree at the end of their senior
year. Starting early allows stu-
dents to complete a graduate
degree in one year rather than
two. Peterson said the Pub-
lic Health School is looking to
increase awareness about the
program, and possibly expand it
to schools other than LSA.
This year, 63 graduate stu-
dents are working toward a
degree in nutrition. Aaronson
said student enrollment will
likely increase due to the estab-
lishment of the specialized
Nutritional Sciences Depart-
ment and to department faculty
plans to increase recruitment
efforts. If the number of stu-
dents increases, Aaronson said
the school will need to hire new
faculty members.
"As we see our student enroll-
ment grow, that will allow us to
open up more lines to hire more
faculty members," Aaronson
said. "I think it will be a gradual,
sequential process. We'll try and
get two new faculty members
hired within the next year."
Student interest in nutrition is
growing as the field itself grows.
According to the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics, job growth
in nutrition should grow by 21
percent between 2012 and 2022.
Peterson said nutrition is an
avenue both for treating health
issues such as obesity, as well as
preventing other health prob-
lems.
"There's this growing rec-
ognition that nutrition is an
essential cornerstone to human
health," she said. "When we look
at people who have health prob-
lems in developing countries, or
we look at health problems in
the U.S., so many of those are
related to nutrition."


FERGUSON
From Page 1
against police brutality drew
national attention, conversations
about the relationship between
race and law enforcement at the
University. On Tuesday evening,
the decision to not indict Wil-
son resulted in riots in Ferguson
throughoutthe night and into early
Wednesday morning.
The discussion at the University
Tuesday night was the second of
two meetings. The first took place
in October when Jones, McCoy
and Singleton returned from visit-
ingFerguson, where they observed
the Ferguson October weekend, an
event that gathered people from
all over the countrytraveled to the
city to protest against police bru-
tality.
Students said they found out

about the event through tweets
posted by Jones on Monday morn-
ing. She emphasized that these
meetings are part of an ongoing
conversation.
"What I am most interested in
is listening to students," she said.
"One of the things we know about
the movement in Ferguson is that
it is a youth movement. It was time
for us to hear from students."
Questions , led to a discussion
about the role the grand jury deci-
sion will play in the larger context
of the protests inFerguson.
"I'm really proud of us for tak-
ing time ^to talk about something
we care about, to do it collectively
and to wrestle with what are real-
ly hard questions not only with
what's happening in Ferguson, but
what this says about the country
and where we should go," Jones
said.
"We have to stretch ourselves to

expand our ideas about where jus-
tice is and how we can call it into
being. I think that we may not get
it fromthe grand jurytoday," Jones
said before the announcement was
made. "If there is no indictment
people will be deprived even fur-
ther ofthis senseofjustice."
After the group watched the
grand jury deliver the announce-
ment, students were silent, reserv-
ing four and a half minutes of
silence in Brown's honor. Multiple
students bowed their heads and
cried.
After the four and a half min-
utes were over, the room remained
silent. After 10 minutes, several
students began to share their
thoughts with the group.
Countryman ended the meet-
ing by announcing a vigil on the
Diag on Tuesdayat 6 p.m. Students
made a collective decision to wear
black inBrown's memory.

over the content of the action itself
- and in a situation as exceptional
as this, should be expected to seize
upon that exceptionality's source
and take issue with it.
This cuts to the basic problem
behind using executive action
to implement a policy change
as significant as this one: a
presidential directive can't claim
any of the legitimacy that debate and
discussion in Congress confer upon
if the legislation it passes (If what
follows doesn't clarify this for you,
the recent "Saturday Night Live"
skit involving Obama's executive
decision should suffice.) That body's
dismal -and contradictory approval

ratings aside, the process it owns has
agreatdealofhistoricalandsymbolic
weight. Its members are pieces of the
most comprehensive, current and
concise human mosaic of collective
American political and ideological
opinion in existence. The president,
in comparison, is only a single
person and while his or her views
might change over time in office to
better reflect those of the public, the
impressions and opinions the public
forms change at a much slower pace.
Whether Americans feel that the
president represents their concerns
is outside of the president's
control, and still independent
from their right to representation

in Congress.
In short, the contemporary
blowback from opponents of immi-
gration reform through executive
action and the methodical disre-
gard shownbyits supporters should
not come as a surprise to anyone
with knowledge of Congress's insti-
tutional role in legitimizing policy
change. Executive action can cer-
tainly make change more quickly
than Congress can; its test now will
be to see if it can hold up without
the formidable power of legislative
legitimization at its back.

Parting with
couple weeks ago, I was fortunate
enough to be an audience member
in the Center for Entrepreneurship's
Entrepreneurship Hour
debate between Max Fin-
berg and John Hart. Finberg
the senior advisor to the
Assistant Secretary of Agri-
culture and also served as a
Senior Policy Advisor with-
in President Barack Obama's
Domestic Policy Council.~
Hart is a Republican who
is an award-winning writer DEVIN
and the editor-in-chief of EGGERT
Opportunity Lives. Hart
also served under former
Republican U.S. Representatives Jim DeMint
and Steve Largent and as Republican Senator
Tom Coburn's communications director.
For several weeks, this talk between Fin-
berg and Hart was promoted within our class
as some kind of political smackdown within the
political barriers surrounding entrepreneur-
ship. Iwill admit that my boredom gave way to
simple-minded pleasure, as I did look forward
to this event in this context. I caught myself
daydreaming of old red-and-blue clad politi-
cians in a WWE ring with my fellow University
students shouting, "Give 'em the chair!"
OK, I'll admit. I'd still be up for
this happening.
But, to my surprise, and seemingly to the
coordinators', Finbergand Hartcame in waving
a white flag similar to Disney's "Pocahontas."
Both of the influential leaders stressed
that although they maintain different core
beliefs and philosophies of government, they
respected each other's views and were open
to listening to alternative approaches. I leaned
back in my seat, puzzled as to why I thought
this was so revolutionary. Is individuality and
open-mindedness not something that we are all
constantly striving to improve upon?
The idea !hit me. Although, ideas like
tolerance are stressed, not once have I seen
adults of influence have a respectful debate
about politics. My mind flashed through casual
offhand digs by professors, obscene political
cartoons and Bill O'Reilly. Not once could I
recall two adults having a debate that I would
call mature, intelligent and respectful.
The debate proceeded.
Finberg and Hart navigated us through
the cores of their beliefs. Their philosophies
are nested in the amount of power and
responsibility, the government should exert
on its people. The extras, the platforms that a
representative markets votes with are based on
interpretations ofwhat people withthose ideals
should believe. Now I don't want to paint Mr.
Finberg and Mr. Hart as idols in a messed-up
atmosphere, though their friendship deserved
a Disney theme song. They too fell into a five-
minute trap in which they were debating a
long list of presidents starting with Reagan vs.
Obama. It became a political version of "mine's
bigger," duringwhich a youngwoman turned to
me and said, "I honestly don't even remember
which one belongs to which party." That
was another moment of surprise to me. Her
comment enticed me to survey the audience
of young entrepreneurs, of whom I thought
would surely side with one side or another. The

partisanship
crowd looked largely annoyed as well. Maybe
they were like me. Instead of seeing political
solutions as A=A, B=B, or A or B only, the crowd
was seeing the bigger picture. Maybe A+B+ a
little C= S ... an actual solution.
Proposing political solutions to a crowd
of people largely focused on out-of-the-box
solutions and seeing a bigger picture initiated a
different vibe.
I'lladmitnow,Idon'tidentifywith aparticular
party. Each election I read information about
the representatives and think critically about
what approach would be best for the nation at
a certain time and particular representatives'
capabilities. But, I am one of the 14.08 percent
in Washtenaw County that voted in the 2014
Midterm Elections. Even if you are a lifelong
whatever, the logic of always having a primed,
simple, bipartisan set of solutions doesn't make
sense when trying to solve a complex problem.
For example, a point in the Finberg and Hart
debate was the issue of extreme student debt in
the United States. Finberg brought up the point
that it's necessary and right to have government
provide aid for students. Hart brought up
the point that while this is necessary, these
packages give universities the idea that they
can jack up their prices under the assumption
that it's the government's responsibility to
cover for those facing financial difficulties. It
was obvious from my seat in the audience that
both of these points probably had merit. Both
of these points could probably be used to build
a better system of education for students. And,
even as someone who works two jobs to fund
their own schooling and relies on financial aid,
I can look at the issue through a larger lens.
So where do wegofrom here?
As the debate wrapped up, I raised my hand
to ask this question.
"I feel extremely grateful to have you both
here today, Mr. Finberg and Mr. Hart. It was
amazing of the Center for Entrepreneurship
to put this event on. This is actually the first
time I have seen an adult Democrat and
Republican of influence have a beneficial and
respectful talk regarding politics. But in reality
most Americans are not exposed to this sort
of composed idea exchange. What are some
resources or solutions you can recommend?"
The answer was along the lines of us
needing to elect people in offices that care less
about getting reelected, because in reality,
that is what a large percentage of politicians
on both sides care about.
That is an answer I get a lot. It is an answer
that gives you nothing to work with.
I unfortunately don't have an answer to
our American political system that functions
more and more like a sports rivalry between
University of Michigan and The Ohio State
University. But, I do challenge others to
remember that an entrepreneurial attitude
can be successful in many facets of life.
Remember our relentless protests to get our
football team back to its ideals and our open
student discussion on possible solutions.
There's a reason that our legal system isn't
reliant on robots. For all the faults that
humans have, compassion and open-minded
creativity is irreplaceable.

Refusing to be radical

By any means necessary. The
phrase, delivered by Mal-
colm X in a speech given at
the founding rally
of the Organization
of Afro-American
Unity in 1964, has
become a chant
among activist
groups throughout
the 20th and 21st
centuries. In Mal-
colm X's speech, he
announces, "That's ABBY
our motto. We TASKIER
want freedom by
any means neces-
sary. We want justice by any means
necessary. We want equality by any
means necessary."
His words planted the seeds
of hope among the minorities the
represented, and yet, in November
2014, University of Michigan students
still shout out that same motto -
"We want equality by any means
necessary" - as minority enrollment
is at its lowest number in years,
comprising only 10 percent of the
student body.
On the afternoon of Thursday,
Nov. 20, The Michigan Daily report-
ed that the organization By Any
Means Necessary protested directly
outside of the meeting of the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents, prompting
the evacuation of the regents and
executive officers from the room.
The organization insisted upon the
University's recognition of serious
minority issues that plague campus
and notably, the group proposed
the implementation ofrthe 10 Ber-
cent plan - a rule allowing any high
school student in the top 10 percent
of his or her class to be admitted to
any public university in the state of
Michigan. According to the Daily's
coverage, University President Mark
Schlissel implied that the plan is
infeasible. In Schlissel's defense,
such a plan wouldn't necessarily
ensure minority enrollment. But, the
issues of segregation and underrep-
resentation of minorities stem way

beyond the control of the University.
As American citizens, we're
well aware that these are systemic
concerns, dating back to American
slavery and the absolute control of
the white man. Today, the American
forces of oppression aren't as easily
identifiable in broad daylight.
Oppression exists in more subtle, less
blatant designs - the confinement of
minorities to ghettos, perpetuated
mass incarceration of African-
Americans, cycles that leave children
uneducated and prompt a lack of
education for future generations.
This has been coined as "The New
Jim Crow." But I have to wonder,
when oppression manifests itself
inconspicuously to the uncurious
eye, is it worthy of being challenged
by any means necessary?
I spent a semester studying abroad
in Cuba, which I can say, for all
intents and purposes, is governed by
an authoritarian regime. Despite the
palm trees, the Caribbean sun and
the colors that illuminate the old,
dilapidated buildings, oppression
runs high on the island. My Cuban
friends, who quietly despised the
system and uttered words of discon-
tent when given jolts of liquid cour-
age, were trained to be quiet about
their criticisms of Cuban socialism.
From the rhetoric they'd been taught,
opposition is bad and compliance is
good. Alberto, my Cuban boyfriend
at the time, was taken to jail simply
for walking alongside my American
friend. The police officers assumed
that he was selling himself to the
American girl he accompanied on
the street. Being a whi'te foreigner, I
was the only one with the power to
get the arrest expunged. A Cuban
attempting to explain the same situ-
ation would have been written off as
a liar, a counterrevolutionary or an
accomplice to foreign exploitation.
I often wondered why there wasn't
more opposition to the system, why
Cuban citizens who'd only been able
to eat grains of rice and a few beans
that day weren't marching along the
oceanside promenade demanding

more resources and more rights. But
fear burdened their activism. Under
the Cuban system, every citizen
lacks liberty. Was this means for a
radical movement - one that would
come into existence by any means
necessary? At first I thought so, but
then I thought of Cuba's past.
The reason for Cuba's oppressive
government is the 1959 Cuban revo-
lution. Fidel Castro, CheGuevaraand
a myriad of other young, hotheaded
revolutionaries overthrew the dic-
tatorship of Fulgencio Batista - a
tyrant maintaining severe economic
and social inequality. They achieved
their goal of subversion by any means
necessary: guerilla warfare. Now,
the system has returned to its dicta-
torial roots - but under the guise of
socialism. Having achieved the revo-
lution's goal by any means necessary,
such violent and oppressive tactics
associated with the doctrine became
accepted, normal.
Come back to contemporkry
America. Come back to the BAMN
protest that forced Schlissel out of his
seat. Radical activism is needed on
college campuses. Radical activism is
still needed when injustice is no lon-
ger blatantly obvious, but lurks in the
shadows, pullingcertain people away
from the potential for achievement.
Racism is gone because we have a
Black president, right?
Wrong.
As Americans, we're afforded the
ability to fight for our liberties. But
it's hard to get behind a dogma that
propagates violence and seemingly
opposes active discourse. BAMN is
trying to get things doneBAMN is
fighting for something we should all
be fighting for, regardless of ourrace,
gender or class. But, when the motto
"by any means necessary" infiltrates
the situation, one is left to wonder:
how far are they willing to go? And if
it's past nonviolent, radical activism,
I for one will have a hard time taking
part in it.

How to talk about the Middle East in class

An alternative for change

If you guessed that Republicans and
Democratic President Barack Obama
have generally concluded that working
with each other through the
normal legislative process
to address the country's
problems is too hard, you
wouldn't be too far off from
the truth. So, much like what
many students are tempted
to do at this point in then
semester, they have resigned
themselves to mediocrity
and half-measures to get by ERIC
and get what they want. FERGUSON
This kind of resignation
has been happening for
years in multiple sectors of the political arena
- witness how Republicans slammed Medi-
care reform through Congress at 5 a.m. in 2005
while ignoring the amount of time allocated to
the vote. And how presidents have been habitu-
ally able to ignore the War Powers Act of 1973,
particularly its restrictions on the use of mili-
tary force, in the face of a Congress that has only
chosen to invoke it once. It happened again last
Thursday, as Obama announced a policy shift
on immigration through an executive order.
Along with a few nods to border security in a
lackluster attempt to appeal to Republicans,
it granted five million undocumented immi-
grants apathwayto temporary U.S. residence if
theycan fulfill araftofeligibilityrequirements.
Don't get me wrong - this is, unquestion-

ably, a better policy than the current one.
Among other things, it creates an essential and
long-promised avenue through which people,
who have worked extremely hard and embody
American ideals, can cease to fear deportation'
while not incentivizing new arrivals outside of
the legal system in place. However, as gratify-
ing as the result may feel, the means used to
get there matter. That executive action - stem-
ming purely from the executive branch - was
the only feasible way to change immigration
policy for the better, and it is deeply troubling
from an institutional perspective. '
For those who care deeply about a legisla-
tively frozen issue, executive actions' power
as a tool for change is extraordinarily seduc-
tive. Part of the reason for this is simple. Self-
interest makes it hard to care about the process
behind policies that will enhance your, your
friends', or your social group's quality of life
if only a deadlocked Congress weren't in the
way. The singular, often deeply personal fac-
tors driving this interest are resistant to all but
the most flagrantly irresponsible policy solu-
tions to the problem - irrespective of whether
a court order, bill or bureaucratic rule change
caused it.
Thankfully,Obama'sactiononimmigration
is well outside of that range. Moreover, its
status as a victory for those directly affected
bythe immigration issue leads them and their
ideological supporters to classify the means
as a lower-level, almost trivial concern.
Those left in opposition end up outraged

Be as geographically vague as
possible. Treat the Middle
East as one nation with
expansive deserts,
run-down buildings
and people living
in tents. Men wear
turbans and smoke
hookah. There are
also underground n
night clubs,
unlimited wealth
and very aggressive
sheikhs - think HAYA
"Aladdin." The ALFARHAN
Middle Eastis both a
war-torn wasteland*
and a place of riches,
filled with oil-drunk-barbarians.
Treat Arabs, Persians, Muslims
and Middle Easterners as though
they are all one homogenous, indis-
tinguishable group because they
all look the same to you anyway.
If someone in class points out that
Arabs are not equal to Muslims and
Persians are not equal to Arabs, nod
knowingly, and then proceed to con-
flate them anyway. It's really hard for
you to keep all these identities apart.
Express your disdain for the state
of minorities in that region. Make
sure to use the word "backward" as
much as possible. Constantly refer to
Muslims as being part of the "most
oppressed race." Always begin by
talking about Muslim women, and
how they're treated so awfully,
how they're forced into marriages,
how they're not allowed to pursue
education, how they're waiting for
you to get on a volunteer trip to help
liberate them. Definitely bring up the
fact that women aren't allowed to
drive, despite the fact that this issue

is central to literally one country in
the entire region. Again, don't get too
caught up in the details. The point
is, these women need saving, even
when they say they're fine. To quote
FEMEN, the Ukraine feminist group
famous for its topless protests, "They
write on their posters that they don't
need liberation but in their eyes it's
written 'help me."'
When talkingabout Arab and Mus-
limwomen, always remind your fellow
classmates that the veil is a thing. A
very oppressive thing. When it comes
to women's issues, it's all a "thing."
In the Middle East, "things" happen
to women. Female genital mutilation
is a thing, honor killings are a thing,
acid attacks are a thing, forced mar-
riage is a thing. Attempting to trace
and understand socio-economic and
political factors that have created and
contributed these issues is too compli-
cated. Framing issues isn't important,
because these women are being treat-
ed like bodies for their governments
to project their ideologies on, they're a
means to a political end. Never ques-
tion whether or not you're partially
fueled by your American exceptional-
ism. You're the good guy here.
In your political science class,
always center the United States
in every Middle Eastern conflict.
Disregard any history of colonialism,
Western influence and American
interventions. The region has always
been in chaos. Talk about the Middle
East in abstract terms detached
from the reality of people's lived
experiences. Talk about Islam like
it's some rigid and monolithic system
of beliefs independent of the people
who practice it - a failure on behalf
of the West to humanize Middle

Easterners. Pay attention to youth
movements and grassroots activism
in the Middle East when it's trendy
to talk about, when it's trending on
Twitter #PeaceinTheMiddleEast
#ArabSpringForever.
When you feel like you're losing
their attention, try to pull them back
by throwing in 9/11 or anything
that'll blind them with a sense of
patriotism. Ifbringing9/11seemslike
too much of a stretch, make sure to
use buzz words like "jihad," "suicide
bombers," "al Qaeda," "extremist,"
"radical,""sharia," "fundamentalist."
In English class, always mention
how amazed you are that the
Middle East isn't as primitive as you
assumed it would be. The reading
your professor assigned didn't
mention anything about camels. The
characters were well rounded and
people were going about their daily
lives. Nobody's hand got chopped off.
If you're taking an Arabic class, let
everyone know on the first day that
you're doing it so you can help fight
the war on terror. Reduce a very rich
language spoken by millions to just
another qualification on your resume.
Arabic is the language spoken by the
terrorists and you want to infiltrate
their ranks from within. Your opinion
iswellinformed,you'vebeenwatchingf
"Homeland" since it premiered.
Always end by talking about
freedom. Your freedom, their
freedom. Freedom is always . the
operative word.

EVENT RECAP
Panel features 'U'
alumni in fashion

FILM REVIEW
'Mockingj ay' doesn't
deliver as expected

Fashion Speaks
panelists discuss
career paths
at Rackham
By KATIE CAMPBELL
For The Daily
On Nov. 18, Rackham
Auditorium saw the first
ever Fashion Speaks panel
hosted by campus fashion
magazine SHEI and the
Michigan Association of
Communication Studies
(MACS). The panel featured
Michigan alumni who are
authorities on the fashion
industry, drawing in an
eager crowd of students
ready to take notes. The
speakers presented with the
intention of sharing their
personal experiences within
the business, describing
their individual career
paths.
LSA junior Jilly Richman
is the literary editor of SHEI
Magazine and co-creator of
the Fashion Speaks panel.
Without a fashion major at
the University and only a
limited number of outlets for
students who are interested
in the industry, Richman
and her fellow founders saw
an opportunity to bring in
alumni who could inform
students on careers in
fashion.
"I think a lot of people
don't even know where

to begin because it's not
like you pursue a degree
in fashion," Richman said.
"Some people don't have
the opportunity to have
internship experiences
or don't know how to
necessarily get connected
with internships. There
are others ways of getting
involved, so I think it's really
great to hear about from
people who have been there."
The five presenters
invited to the panel were
all University alumni, two
of them previous Michigan
Daily employees. The
presenters included Marly
Graubard, W Magazine's
Executive Director of
Fashion and Beauty, Steve
Madden Ltd. President
Matthew Guthartz, and
more.
"We reached out to the
speakers through LinkedIn,
through the Comm. alumni,
SHEI alumni," LSA junior
Hannah Schiff, president
of marketing for MACS and
writer for SHEI, explained.
"We were just looking at any
type of alumni that we could
get our hands on."
Each of the presenters
shared experiences of
misdirection in their careers,
which ultimately led them
to their current positions.
Between working hard and
building, solid networks
through colleagues at the
University, they discussed
the paths that successfully
led them to the top of their

professions. Among the
anecdotal advice and real
life experience handed
out to the audience, the
guidance consistently leaned
toward the typical creative
profession mentality: don't
be afraid to make mistakes,
show ambition, prove
accountability and pursue
your passion.
As far as interest goes,
the event spread across
campus anl brought in
an unexpected number of
student fashion devotees,
requiring that the panel
be moved to a Rackham
Auditorium for more
seating.
"We've gotten an immense
reception from the students,
and I think it just shows
that there really is a desire
for more fashion events like
this and that there's space
for people to bring different
ideas to Michigan." Richman
said.
As ,for as the future
for Fashion Speaks goes,
Richman hopes that the
panel can sustain a presence
on campus. If students'
interest in fashion continues
and expands, she sees the
panel doing the same.
"We would love to create
a basis for SHEI and MACS
or other organizations to
expand this type of forum,"
she explained. "I would love
to see it expand further
and to become some kind of
career event and networking
opportunity."

'Hunger Games'
sequel tries too
hard to be dark
By NOAH COHEN
DailyArts Writer
Young Adult fiction has seen
a growing trend of dramatic
and strange
dystopias. C-
"Divergent,"
"Maze The Hunger
Runner," Games:
"The Hunger
Games" - Mockingjay,
each of these part 1
has chosen
to adopt a Qualit 201
consistent
degree of Lionsgate
realness. "The
HungerGames"changeditschoice
in its most recent installment,
opting to take the story several
notches chillier.
But "The Hunger Games:
Mockingjay - Part 1" is riddled
with problems. Young adult
fiction has a shaky precedent
for the degree of darkness that
"Mockingjay - Part 1" strives for.
Inpreviousfilms,the audience was
exposed to children murdering
each other, but those films didn't
put war and personal violence and
PTSD onscreen for two straight
hours. The dramatic portrayal of
pain was too much. There was
a need for relief, and the movie
didn't deliver. It left the audience
with weird feelings. F
Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence,
"Silver Linings Playbook") was
rescued from the oversight of The
Capital at the end of "Catching
Fire," and in this movie, Lawrence
plays an emotionally broken
17-year-old girl forced to present
herself as the living symbol of a
violent revolution. Most of the
film is dedicated to documenting
her character development as
she's huddled in a bunker with
the resistance, the rebel faction,
District 13. The only games in this
movie are horrible mind-games.
"Mockingjay - Part 1"
consistently commits to its
sadnesses and angers, at times
losing touch with how sadness
and anger exist in reality, and at
other times, striking those notes
with killing precision. Different
actors handle the pressure of
the portrayal of angst with
vastly differing levels of success.
Lawrence does not fit the role of
Katniss in this movie. When she
puts her hand to her mouth to
show shock, it feels like there's
a director behind the camera
telling her to do just that. This
movie tries to transform her pain
into a dramatic event, and the
choices it makes in that effort are

A murderer.
questionable. After a beautiful
scene with a cat and a flashlight,
Katniss flat-out explains the
resonance of the scene to Gale
- exposition for the children in
the audience. Much of the script
is conspicuously Y.A. The film
captures an awesome darkness,
which young adults can handle,
buttheColdWarrealismisdiluted
by overkill escorting-scenes to
ensure the level of darkness is
acknowledged.
Peeta (Josh Hutcherson,
"Bridge to Terabithia") handles
the portrayal of his PTSD with
greater grace than Katniss. His
hauntedness succeeds where
Katniss's waterworks fail.
The interview format of his
presentationin"Mockingjay- Part
1" gives Peeta a believable platform
from which to deliver his wooden
lines, whereas Katniss expresses
herself strangely in context. When
she's speaking into the camera
from the desolated District 12 (her
former home), she vents about
what the resistance "must" do.
Real 17-year-olds experiencing fits
of emotion, especially those who
grew up in starving poverty, don't
say "we must," they say "we have
to," and it's these small dramatic
exaggerations that cripple this
film.
When Gale (Liam Hemsworth,
"Paranoia") talks t}about how:
he and Katniss kissed, Katniss
responds, "I didn't think you
remembered that." This is
another exaggerated PTSD
moment. Who expects their best
and only friend to forget their
kiss? Many more things were
unbelievable: the bombed bodies
with the unbroken skeletons;
the stricken villagers in District
8 who ask Katniss the perfect
questions for a propaganda reel,
the rain propagating through the
underground bunker in 13.
There's a scene in the bunker
when the doors are about to
lock, where Prim and Katniss
practically mosey down that
staircase; it's laughable. Her life
is on the line, and she's taking the
stairs one at a time. Real people
don't take the stairs one at a time
under threat of death.

The real stars are Finnick
(Sam Claflin, "Snow White and
the Huntsman") and Haymitch
(Woody Harrelson, "True
Detective"). Finnick's pain is
probably the most authentic
among the traumatized
Victors, and his kiss with
Annie is the singular highest
romantic achievement of the
entire franchise to date. On
another positive note, the way
Haymitch's status as a recovering
addict is incorporated into his
character represents a rare
note of thoughtful writing, and
endears him to the audience as
a known and dependable entity
in circumstances of chaos. Even
when the- world is burning, you
can count on Haymitch to be
trying to score some drugs from a
traumatized 17-year-old.
The cold gompulsion of this
filmwas expected as soon as "Part
1" was announced as an element
of the title. "The Hunger Games"
is doing what "The Hobbit" did,
and it's working about as well.
"Mockingjay-Partl"didless well
this weekend than either "The
Hunger Games" or "Catching
Fire" did, and deservedly so. It
hasthe words"Partl"to thank for
that. However, it manages to leave
viewer on a powerful cliffhanger.
At the end, the audience is
genuinely concerned for Peeta's
wellbeing, then Lorde's "Yellow
Flicker Beat" plays, and we feel
it. "Yellow Flicker Beat" is a
beautiful anthem for the credits
roll along to. The credits (which
pay tribute to the late Philip
Seymour Hoffman, who plays the
ethically iffy Plutarch) are almost
a dirge. "Yellow Flicker Beat," in
its affective power, is reminiscent
of "Into The West," the credit
roll track for "The Return of the
King." In both cases, a contralto
epilogue for heartbreak, but in
the case of "Mockingjay - Part
1," it's a 17-year-old singing. Very
appropriate.
The credit - and Finnick's
kiss - were the only bullseyes
of this movie. The film was
dramatic Absolute Zero. It wasn't
completely wrong, but it wasn't
what we came to see.

Pitbull strugglestohold
" his own on new album

By CARLY SNIDER
Daily Arts Writer
By this point in his career,
Pitbull's persona and reputation
have come to precede him. When
thinking
about the
Cuban
rapper, one's Globalization
mind jumps Pitbull
to overly RCA
processed
club hits, almost always featuring
a popular artist on the chorus,
and less-than-insightful lyrical
content. Not to mention his
signature - and questionable -
style of white suits and sunglasses.
While gaining more and more
recognition - Pit hosted the
AMAs this year and was chosen
to sing the official FIFA World
Cup song - Globalization was a
perfect opportunity for the rapper
to break out and be innovative.
Unfortunately, Mr. Worldwide
delivered the same tired tracks.
The album starts out with
the dubstep-driven, "Ah Leke,"
featuring Sean Paul. Like most
Pitbullsongs,thisoneisextremely
repetitive without much depth.
Paul's contribution doesn't go
much further than repeating the
same line again and again, while
Pitgoes on and on abouthisglobal
identity.
Moving into more dance-
friendly sounds, the album
picks up with "Fun (feat. Chris
Brown)" which gives listeners
more 'of Pitbull's classic Cuban
beats. While this track's backing
and main melody are engaging,
Brown does little to add to the
song. His vocals are processed
to the point where they could
have been provided by anyone,
and Pit, as per usual, raps only
about his unimpressive ability
to get women and drink copious
amounts of alcohol.
The album's peak comes in
"Fireball," a drunken ode to
the popular cinnamon whiskey.
The track's chorus, provided by
John Ryan, is catchy and would
be easy to sing along to while
drunk on its namesake beverage.
The song even features what
sounds like a room full of people

RCA

Mr. Clean steps rap game up, incorporates dole into vocabulary.

joyously shouting "Fireball," a
sound not uncommon throughout
campus on Friday nights.
Long instrumental breaks and
changes of pace make the song
perfect for parties, tailgates or
solo dance sessions. While in no
way insightful, inspirational or
innovative, the song does what it
sets out to do. With Ryan's help,
Pitbull managed to produce a
fairly entertainingparty jam.
From this point on, the album
trudges through more of the same
chorus-driven tracks. Even with
features from various artists such
as Jason Derulo and Juicy J on
"Drive You Crazy" and Ne-Yo on
"Time Of Our Lives," the cliches
run rampant. Subject matter
consists almost exclusively of
partying, sexandlivingitupwhile
stillyoung. While there is nothing
wrong with these sentiments -
everyone loves a good night out -
they become far too overdone to
be enjoyable.
Adding to the repetitiveness
are Pit's constant reminders of
his exotic nature. Every track
features multiple mentions of
Mr. Worldwide, the Miami area
code 305 and his dale catch
phrase. His "beachy" persona is
epitomized in "Sexy Beaches"
and "Day Drinking," with both
tracks having spring break
vibes. "Sexy Beaches," a not so
subtle euphemism for referring
to women as bitches, is classic
Pitbull, letting featured artist
Chloe Angelides do all the work.

In "Day Drinking," Pit tries for
a slightly country sound and
fails. The track is more laid
back, which doesn't mesh well
with Pitbull's faster paced rap
style. Not to mention the slightly
uncomfortable use of the phrase
"crazy mother fuckers" in the
chorus, as the song is not at all
wild in comparison to the rest of
the album.
Pitbull also struggles to find
his place on some of his own
tracks. In "Wild Wild Love (feat.
G.R.L.)" and "This Is Not A Drill
(feat. Bebe Rexha)" Pit sounds
out of place, almost as though
he is being featured on someone
else's song rather than the other
way around. This is especially
obvious on "This Is Not A
Drill," as Rexha's contribution
is undeniably her own sound,
using more techo-based beats
and sirens in the background.
Essentially out of his element,
with a lack of any Latin beats,
Pitbull is unable to match her.
Ultimately, this album
delivers exactly what listeners
would expect - an alcohol
fueled, sex driven compilation
of laughably repetitive party
songs. Tracks featured classy
lyrical gems such as "Always like
a squirrel, looking for a nut" and
were largely based upon choruses
that Mr.305had no part in. While
Pitbull continues to embody
his international character, his
foreign flair is not enough to bring
him success with Globalization.

Uber and Spotify collaborate

By RACHEL KERR
Daily Arts Writer
Every time I get into an
Uber, the first thing out of
my mouth is always: "Do you,
have an aux cord?" And while
I do enjoy badgering my driver
about music, now I'll no longer
have to.
Announced last Monday,
a new partnership between
Spotify and Uber will allow
Spotify premium account
holders to stream their music
through the Uber app.
If you're unfamiliar
with Uber - do you live
in the 21st century? - the
company launched in 2010
and introduced us to a more
personalized taxi service, one
in which drivers were easily
accessible and knew your
name before you even got in
the car. It also got rid of the
inconvenience of carrying
around cash for a cab, as
well as the "how much do I
tip?" dilemma, by charging
users directly through their
smartphone, tip included.
And, the experience
just became even more
personalized. Now, when
"calling" an Uber through
the app, those who pay

$10-a-month ($5 if you're a
student) for a Spotify premium
account will be able to choose
what music will play on the
ride, as long as the car is
"Spotify-enabled:"
Spotify is a music service
that allows anyone to instantly
stream endless amounts of
songs and albums from their
database. It's available to all
account holders on a computer,
and, if you're one of millions
who pays for a premium
account, you also have access
to unlimited streaming on
your phone: And now, during
your Uber rides, too.
There are a few catches,
though.
It's not available in Ann
Arbor. Yet. The feature,
which just launched on Nov.
21, is starting out in select
cities, including Los Angeles,
Toronto and New York.
The service is also optional
for the driver. Meaning, if
they don't want to listen to
French Montana, you can't
make them listen to French
Montana. Granted, you can
express your dissatisfaction
by giving the driver a bad
review, but that doesn't
change the fact that you
didn't get to listen to French

Montana.
You also can't control the
volume; sadly, that is still
dictated by the driver. So,
while I'll no longer be asking
if they have an aux cord, I
sure as hell will continue to
ask them to please turn the
music up.
The announcement comes
shortly after Taylor Swift
pulled the entirety of her'
discography from Spotify,
including her wildly popular
new album 1989. Enraged
fans wanted to know why.
Apparently, Spotify refused
Swift's request to allow only
premium account holders
access to her music. She
responded by not allowing any
Spotify account holder to have
access to her music, citing the
disparity between royalties
from the paid account and
those from the free service as
her reason.
This new feature, though,
could give many people the
incentive to drop the extra
cash for a premium account,
which would in turn, lead to
higher royalties for artists
using Spotify. Maybe Swift
will even put her music back
up! If not, I didn't really want
to listen to 1989 anyway.

it's hard to set
oneself apart.
Yet, French dubstep master
David Guetta has done a pretty
impressive job of running ahead
of the pack, churning out mega-
hits like the eloquent "Sexy Bitch"
with Akon and "Pitch Perfect"
staple "Titanium," featuring
Sia, that deviate nicely from the
dub formula. His latest album is

superstars and new faces alike; on
it, he continues innovation streak
on many songs but too often falls
into the shackles of typicality.
Strongcollaborationsmake this
album shine - piano siren Emeli
Sande lends her magic to "What
I Did for Love," a sadder, slower
yet still epic tune that turns into
a dance anthem quickly, complete
with Sand6's soulful vocals. A
surprising partnership with The
Script proves halfway decent,
too, with lead singer Danny
O'Donoghue's scratchy-pretty
voice weaving its way through
nostalgic, optimistic lyrics and a
big arena drop.
"Dangerous," one of the
album's pre-released singles, is
the better of the two Sam Martin
songs on the album, laced with
interesting piano-turned-synth
hooks and streamlined vocals
from Martin. The other, "Lovers
on the Sun," sets itself apart with
its uniqueness - it gives off eerie,
Wild-West vibes in the verses,
with distant whistling in the

background and echo-y vocals.
But that trance is shattered when
the synths come in and the chorus
turns into a typical, wordless club
jam. Guetta works best when he
strays from the norm.
Sia makes two appearances
on Listen, and both fall into
the shadows of her luminous
breakout hit, "Chandelier." She's
too good to ignore, though, and
her distinct vocals are tailor-
made for the album's closing
track, "The Whisperer." This one
is different in its lack of a beat,
not to be mistaken for a lack of
structure - there's nothingwrong
with a piano ballad following
in the steps of -her emotional
classic, "Breathe Me." And it's
inevitable to compare these
two: Sia's more upbeat number
on this album, "Bang My
Head," disappointingly pales in
comparison to "Titanium."
Guetta tries reggae on for size
in "No Money No Love," a cute
homage to Marley's "No Woman
No Cry" (though the two couldn't
be more different). Initially, it's
jarring to hear a reggae song
underneath dubstep beats and
a giant, synth-laden drop, but
it works. Somehow it turns out
really badass. "Sun Goes Down"
follows in its ska footsteps with
the help of MAGIC!, the culprits
of this summer's most infectious
song, "Rude." The lead singer's
voice is like butter, and he steers
the verses in the right direction -
but Sonny Wilson takes the wheel
in the chorus with his vigorous,
weathered voice, and the two

men work to create a song that's
just too juxtaposed to create a
cohesive listeningexperience.
"Listen," "Yesterday" and
"S.T.O.P." all blend together in one
giant blob of dubstep purgatory -
it's pleasant but less than exciting.
Even though "Listen" and
"S.T.O.P." are graced withthelikes
of John Legend and Ryan Tedder
of One Republic, respectively,
their star power is not enough
to aid the mediocrity of these
melodies. "Lift Me Up" is
enhanced by snippets of Cady
Heron's favorite choral group,
Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and
this mellow groove is a bit of a
refresher.
Hipsters worldwide will
rejoice at "I'll Keep Loving
You," featuring Jaymes Young
and Bon Iver interpreter Birdy.
Without the electronic beats
this song would easily serve its
proper duty as the go-to wedding
song of trendy Brooklyn
twenty-somethings. It sounds
sentimental, smooth, emotional
- but thebeats on top of it make
it weird and dorky.
The best song on the album
is undoubtedly "Hey Mama."
There's a reason Nicki Minaj
rules the charts these days; she
brings a fresh, edgy energy to
everything, and with help from'
Afrojack and Bebe Rexha, this
song is fabulously contagious.
Guettahas assembled anotable
array of musicians, and they,
combined with his talent, make
Listen a solid step forward for
man - and DJ - kind.

The first truly shock-
ing scene in the
movie "Whiplash,"
Damien Chazelle's recent
film about a young drum-
mer and
his abusive
conductor,
comes when
Andrew E
Neiman
(Miles Tell-.
er) gets his
shot withA
the studio THEISEN
band, the
top perfor-
mance group at the conserva-
tory where he studies music.
As Andrew sits behind the
drumkit, he gives the song
his best, but is quickly cut
off. Fletcher, the condc-
tor (J.K. Simmons) initially
reassures Andrew when he
messes up. "Not quite my
tempo, no worries," he says.
Then he makes him do anoth-
er take ("You're rushing").
Then another ("Dragging
just a hair"). Again ("Rush-
ing"). And again ("Drag-
ging"). Finally, Andrew
seems to have it. Fletcher lets
him keep playing, nodding
his head as he walks away
from the kit. He calmly puts
his hand on a folding chair
and WHOOSH, lobs it at
Andrew's head.
Fletcher takes a deep
breath. "Why do you suppose
I just threw a chair at your
head, Neiman?" he asks, way
too calmly. "The tempo?"
Andrew offert. "Were you
arushing or wereyou drag-
ging?" Fletcher fumes. "I
don't know," Andrew admits.
Suddenly, Fletcher advances
on Andrew, orders him to
start counting time and slaps
him in the face on every
fourth beat until Andrew
gets the point..

Jon Stewart's
directorial debut
mixes drama with
comedic moments
By REBECCA LERNER
DailyArts Writer
Not many films can balance
a conversation about pertinent
social issues while also cutting
to the core
of its central A
characters.
Jon Stewart's Rosewater
directorial
debut, Quality 16
"Rosewater," Open Road Films
a fictionalized
account of
Canadian-American Newsweek
journalist Maziar Bahari's
four-month imprisonment and
torture, touches on the repression
of journalists by the Iranian
government in a fast-paced and
energetic manner.
The film takes place in 2009,
whenCanadian-Iranianjournalist
Maziar Bahari (Gael Garcia
Bernal, "The Ardor") travels to
Iran to report on the presidential
election and interview Mir-
Hoissein Mousavi, the challenger
to incumbent President Mahmoud
Ahrnfdinejad Baharileavesbehind
Lond hdtidhispregnantwifkPlsola
(Claire Foy, "Vampire Academy")
for what he promises will be a
short visit. However, because of the
contentious Iranian elections, in
which Ahmadinejad was declared
the winner before voting booths
even closed, violent riots erupted in
the streets protesting this injustice.
As Baharifilms the demonstrations,*

the movie cuts to Maziar Bahari's
actualgrainyfootage ofthe frenzied
crowds and killings. After Bahari
submits his videos to major news
outlets, he is arrested and taken to
Evin Prison.
After arriving at the prison,
Bahari faces Rosewater (Kim
Bodnia, "A Very Unsettled
Summer"), his interrogator for
the next four months. Because
Bahari is blindfolded for most of
their interactions, the only way he
can recognize his interrogator is
the strong smell of rosewater, with
whichBodniaisoftenseenspritzing
himself. Rosewater informs Bahari
that he has been imprisoned for
being a spy for the West. Evidence
for his espionage includes an
interview for"The Daily Show with
Jon Stewart" in which he speaks to
correspondent Jason Jones about
the similarities between Iran and
America while Jones jokes about
being a spy. Rosewater, a dense
and relentless government thug,
believes it is a real conversation
between secret agents. Thus begins
Bahari's four months in prison in
which he is in solitary confinement,
broken up only by psychologically
andphysicallytorturousvisitsfrom
Rosewater.
Throughout his time in prison,
Rosewater convinces Bahari that
he has been essentially forgotten,
when in reality, his wife and
mother are spearheadirigr.aan
international campaign for his
release. In response to this alleged
abandonment, Bahari conjures the
memoriesofhislate father and sister.
His father (Haluk Bilginer, "The
International") was imprisoned
for his communist beliefs under
the Shah's regime, while his sister
(Golshifteh Farahani, "Just Like
a Woman") was thrown in jail for

rebel activities under Ayatollah
Khomeini's government. During
his darkest hours, these fantasies of
his family give him hope.
Many of the film's shining
moments come from the dark
comedy that balances the heavy
subject matter: Any Western source
of entertainment, whether it be
magazines, movies or a Sopranos
DVD box set is automatically
classifiedaspornbythegovernment
officials rumnaging through
Bahari's belongings. During the
interrogations, Rosewater fixates
on Bahari's sex life, highlighting
his own deep sexual frustration.
This leads Bahari to tell erotic tall
tales, "massages of a sexual nature"
within a "sexual playground" also
known as the state of New Jersey.
The use of actual news footage
and the frantic filming style
give the movie's visual approach
the feel of a war documentary,
allowing the audience to feel a part
of the onscreen chaos. Stewart's
use of hashtags floating through
the streets of Tehran effectively
highlights the emphasis on social
media during the pandemonium.
"Rosewater" forces its
audience to come face to face
with an oppressive government
still imprisoning and torturing
people. To illustrate the struggles
of those who were not fortunate
enough to be saved, the arrest of
Bahari's hsis st=taxid r,
Davood (Ofit ,eeida I"The
Monuments Men"), conveys the
continuingfightagainstthe unjust
imprisonment of innocent people.
Though the product of a comedy
legend with some moments of
humor, "Rosewater" is a serious
film that teaches about the
political environment of Iran and
press freedom.

By JUSTIN STERN
Daily Sports Writer
Despite the state of flux of the
Michigan football team after
the firing of Rich Rodriguez,
the Wolverines were able to
convince 10 recruits to remain
committed to the football
program in Ann Arbor in 2011.
Today, as the team continues to
struggle and Michigan football
conch Brady Hoke's departure
seemingly eminent, Michigan
has verbal commitments from
seven recruits with just five
havingshown no interest in other
schools.
After Saturday's loss to
Maryland, the Wolverines saw
their fourth decommit this
season in four-star running back
Mike Weber. And there may be
others who follow.
The moment when Maryland
scoredtheirgo-aheadtouchdown
on Saturday, Weber tweeted "I'm
decommiting from the university
of Michigan thank you Michigan
for the love and support I'll
remake my decision at the army
bowl."
Weber has already said he
will make an official visit to Ohio
State and is also considering
Michigan State and Wisconsin.
He is expected to announce his
decision in January at the U.S.
Army All-American Bowl.
Here is a wrap-up of how
the remaining seven recruits
performed last weekend.
Chris Clark, tight end: Avon
Old Farms (Conn.); Ranking:
ESPN (111) Scout (23)
Clark injured his medial
collateral ligament in his team's
final regular season game, but
noted surgery won't be needed.

After Saturday's loss to
Maryland, Clark tweeted, "Man
michigan has officially hit rock
bottom." Though he, remains
committed to Michigan, Clark
has scheduled official visits
to North Carolina, Southern
California and Texas.
Brian Cole, athlete: Saginaw
Heritage (Mich.); Ranking:
ESPN (142) Scout (39)
Many have become concerned
with Cole's commitment due
to speculation in the last few
months. On Saturday, Cole
reportedly visited Nebraska for .
its game against Minnesota. He
hasn't planned an official visit to
Ann Arbor and many fear he may
end up attending another Big Ten
rival.
Tyree Kinnel,safety: Wayne
(Ohio) vs. Lakota West (Ohio);
Ranking: ESPN (191) Scout
(147)
With Kinnel leading Wayne's
defense, the Warriors defeated
Lakota West 38-3 in the third
-ound of the OHSAA playoffs.
Wayne is headed to the state
championship game against two-
time defending state champions
Cincinnati Archbishop Moeller.
After the victory, Kinnel
told Scout.com, "I know they
(Michigan) are having some
troubles up there. But right now,
I'm trying to stay out of the public
with my recruiting and just focus
on what I need to do on my high
school team. I do have recruiting
plans, but I'm keeping them to
myself until the season is over."
According to Dave Berk of
Scout.com, Kinnel could visit
Notre Dame and Michigan State.
Grant Newsome, offensive
tackle: The Lawrenceville
School (N.J.); Ranking: ESPN

(244) Scout (216)
This weekend, Newsome
visited Ann Arbor and despite the
loss, he seemed positive and still
remains committed to Michigan.
"It was definitely a tough
loss on the field, but besides
that I think it was really a great
visit," Newsome told Scout.
com. "If they were to hire a
coach ... and this is hypothetical
because nothing has happened
... but if there was hypothetically
someone that I really really
didn't like, then that would be
a very very faint possibility (of
reopening his recruitment)."
Alex Malzone, quarterback:
Brother Rice (Mich.); Ranking:
ESPN (NR) Scout (183)
Malzone's season came to
an end with a 26-21 loss in the
MHSAA regionalfinals. Malzone
hasn't signaled he will decommit
from Michigan.
Jon Runyan Jr., offensive
lineman: St. Joseph's Prep
(Pa.) vs. Benjamin Franklin
(Pa.); Ranking: (NR)
St. Joseph's Prep defeated
Benjamin Franklin, 47-22 to
move onto the quarterfinals.
Behind Runyan, the Hawks were
able to rush for more than 300
yards on 41 carries. The Hawks
will face Parkland on Saturday in
the PIAA quarterfinals.
Runyan has not shown any
leanings to another school other
than Michigan.
Andrew David, kicker:
Washington (Ohio); Ranking:
(NR)
David's high school career
came to an end with a 56-7
loss in the OHSAA regional
quarterfinals. He doesn't appear
to be interested in schools other
than Michigan at this moment.

Jack Miller hasn't liked
Ohio State since 2002, and
the Michigan football team's
redshirt junior center isn't
afraid to say so.
It's rivalry week, after all.
"I'll say it in the most
diplomatic way I can: I'm not
a fan of Ohio State. I never
have been," Miller said. "Ever
since they beat Miami in the
2002 National Championship,
I always disliked them. I don't

teammates.
The Wolverines are 20-point
underdogs for their game
against the Buckeyes Saturday
in Columbus.And given the way
both teams' seasons have gone,
that line might seem a little
too small. Michigan is fighting
for bowl eligibility, while Ohio
State has secured a spot in the
Big Ten Championship and
is battling for a berth in the
College Football Playoff.
But in this rivalry, one
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
considers "the greatest one in
sport," rankings often don't
matter. Last year, for instance,
the Wolverines opened as 12.5-
point underdogs, yet scored
what would have been the
game-tying touchdown with 32
seconds remaining.
Instead of sending the game
to overtime by kicking an extra
point, though, Michigan's
seniors elected to go for the win
with a two-point conversion.
The attempt failed, and the
Wolverines lost, 42-41.
"That's what makes rivalries
