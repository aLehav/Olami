“No Justice. No Peace. No 
Racist Police.”
Over 
a 
thousand 
people 
gathered around the Detroit 
Public Safety Headquarters for 
the March Against the Police on 
Friday in response to incidents of 
police brutality across the nation. 
As they were social distancing 
and 
wearing 
masks, 
people 
chanted “No Justice. No Peace. 
No Racist Police.” People of all 
ages, races and backgrounds were 
present to support the Black Lives 
Matter movement. Wayne State 
University freshman Cameron 
Hawkins said he marched to 
fight for his life as a Black male in 
America. 
“My greatest fear in the world 
is getting killed by a police 
officer and I don’t think that’s 
something that I should have to 
worry about,” Hawkins said. 
Organizers 
from 
Metro-
Detroit Political Action Network, 
Occupy Detroit, Abolish ICE 
Detroit, March for Black Women 
Detroit, Progessive Caucus of the 

Michigan Democratic Party and 
Detroit Anarchist Black Cross 
hosted the event and invited 
multiple people to speak at the 
rally. 
Demands 
from 
the 
rally 
organizers included justice for 
Sha’Teina and Dan Grady El, the 
release of non-violent prisoners 
due to COVID-19, justice for 
George Floyd, freedom for the 
Los 
Angeles 
and 
Minnesota 
protesters, the discontinuation 
the use of facial recognition 
technology in law enforcement, 
immediate 
termination 
of 
employment 
and 
criminal 
charges for police officers that 
demonstrate excessive force, and 
an end to mass incarceration.
Jazmine 
Middlebrooks, 
an 
organizer from March for Black 
Women Detroit, spoke on the 
actions that need to be taken 
to handle racism. She said the 
best way for white people to 
be an ally of the Black Lives 
Matter Movement is to intervene 
whenever they encounter racism. 

Saturday afternoon, hundreds 
of community members gathered 
at the University of Michigan 
Diag 
and 
marched 
through 
Ann Arbor in protest of recent 
incidents 
of 
police 
brutality 
against Black Americans that 
shook the nation. In his opening 
address to the crowd, Ann Arbor 
resident Myles McGuire, the sole 
organizer of the event, called it a 
“civil rights protest.”
“Here we are, putting our lives 
in danger during a pandemic to 
protest civil rights,” McGuire 
said. “Not equal — civil. We’re 

asking people to be civil. Asking. 
We should not have to ask for 
civil fucking rights. We should 
not have to fear that our brothers 
and our sisters and our mothers 
and our fathers are going to be 
slaughtered by the ones meant to 
protect us and save us and help 
govern our communities.”
McGuire 
commented 
on 
the 
diversity 
of 
the 
crowd 
gathered 
before 
him, 
which 
was predominantly young and 
multiracial.
“We 
have 
to 
be 
in 
this 
together,” McGuire said. “This is 
not going to start and end with 
Black people. It’s not going to 
start and end with cops. It has to 
be done together.”
After asking the crowd “Are 
you with me?” McGuire invited 
protesters to follow him across 
the 
Diag 
towards 
the 
State 
Street shopping area. Protesters 
marched 
throughout 
the 
downtown streets, holding signs 
and chanting, “Hands up, don’t 
shoot,” “Black lives matter” and 
“No justice, no peace.”
Ann Arbor resident Kash Rai 
held up a sign reading, “Our skin 

color is not a crime.” He said he 
wanted to send a message that 
law enforcement should treat all 
citizens equally, regardless of 
race.
“It’s mostly about white cops 
treating 
colored 
people 
less 
than they would treat another 
white person, such as a noise 
complaint,” Rai said. “It’s ‘Hey, 
shut this party down,’ to a Black 
person versus, ‘Can you just turn 
it down?’ to a white person, which 
I’ve experienced personally.”
Rasem Piromarm, a recent 
graduate 
of 
Caledonia 
High 
School, said he found out about 
the protest from his cousin who 
lives in Ann Arbor. Having grown 
up facing discrimination in his 
predominantly white township, 
Piromarm said he came as a show 
of solidarity, 
“All I grew up hearing was, 
‘You’re a terrorist. You’re a 
bomber,’ because I’m Muslim,” 
Piromarm said. “It was like it 
was me against the world … And 
I relate so much to what’s going

With the luxury shopping mall 
Somerset Collection as a back-
drop and across the street from 
a boarded-up Saks Fifth Avenue 
establishment, approximately 500 
predominantly young protesters of 
all races broke the typical calm of 
a Monday afternoon in the Metro 
Detroit suburb of Troy, Mich., 
chanting, “No justice, no peace, no 
racist police.”
Almost all donning face masks, 
they joined hundreds of thousands 
of people in major cities across the 
United States and across the world 
in peaceful protest of the killing 
of an unarmed Black man, George 
Floyd, by a white police officer, 
among other documented acts of 
police brutality. No Troy police 
officers were seen wearing a mask, 
though The Daily cannot verify 
every officer on the scene did not 
have a mask.
In its entirety, protesters were at 
the Big Beaver Road and Coolidge 
Road area for about four and a half 
hours and remained peaceful the 
entire time, though about 30 pro-
testers who stayed at the end were 
told by Troy police officers they 
would be arrested if they did not 
leave the intersection. None of the 
protesters were arrested, though 
the Troy Police Department arrest-
ed one person, a 68-year-old male 
from Troy who intentionally struck 
a protester with his car. According 
to the Troy Police Department, the 
victim had no apparent injuries.
Troy is about a half-hour drive 
to Detroit. It is one of the many 
suburbs of Metro Detroit that grew 
wealthier from white flight in the 
mid-1900s — the mass movement 
of white families from cities to 
the suburbs in fear their property 
values would deteriorate as Black 
neighbors moved in — and is now 
the largest city in Oakland County, 
one of the richest counties in the 
country. According to 2019 census 
estimates, it is about 68 percent 
white — and just under 4 percent 

Black. 
Most of the protesters arrested 
in Detroit in the last several nights 
of protest there were from its sub-
urbs. According to Troy protest 
organizer Marshele Parker, this 
move to protest in the suburbs of 
Detroit was an intentional choice 
among the organizers. 
“We started seeing people on 
social media saying, ‘Why don’t we 
bring it to the cities that we actu-
ally know hurt us more than the 
city of Detroit?’” Parker said. “So 
that’s when we decided to all come 
to Troy. We decided to go to Som-
erset because it’s one of those big 
malls in Michigan. And because of 
the systematic oppression in place, 
the Black dollar doesn’t stretch 
that far, and when it does, it goes to 
their favorite mall such as Somer-
set with all the glitz and the glam.”
Somerset Collection was closed 
all day Monday in anticipation of 
the protest. In a statement to The 
Oakland Press, Somerset spokes-
man Peter Van Dyke said the clo-
sure was taken as a necessary 
safety precaution for everyone 
involved.
“Somerset Collection values and 
supports freedom of speech and 
peaceful protest,” Van Dyke said.
The event was organized by the 
Black Activist Movement Network, 
a new group formed by Parker 
and other Black college women: 
Rebekah Long, Cameron Simp-
son and Joy Mosley. For over two 
hours, the crowd of several hun-
dred protesters, mainly students 
who lived in the surrounding area, 
walked around the Coolidge Road 
and Big Beaver Road intersec-
tion, then down Big Beaver Road 
towards the Troy Civic Center. 
Many held posters denouncing 
police brutality and anti-Black rac-
ism, chanting as cars around them 
filled the afternoon with honks of 
support.
Among the suburbs, Parker said 
Troy was chosen as the site for 
their protest because of word-of-
mouth about racist interactions 
with the Troy police.

Demonstration in 
Troy: ‘We need to be 
where the silence is’

While 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic rages on and social 
life has come to a stall, cities 
across the United States are 
drawing 
passionate 
crowds 
demanding justice, peace and 
an end to police brutality 
against Black people. 
George Floyd, a Black man, 
was 
killed 
in 
Minneapolis 
police custody on May 25 after 
a white police officer kept his 
knee on Floyd’s neck for eight 
minutes and 46 seconds. Three 
other officers participated in 
the killing. A private autopsy 
confirmed the death was a 
homicide and a result of not 
only choking, but also pressure 
on Floyd’s back from the other 
officers who pinned him down.
While on a jog, Ahmaud 
Arbery was shot outside of 
Brunswick, Ga., after being 
chased by an armed white 
father and son, who believed 
he was a burglar, on Feb. 23. 
According 
to 
the 
Georgia 
Bureau of Investigation, the 
two 
assailants 
have 
been 
arrested and charged with 
murder 
and 
aggravated 
assault. 
GBI 
also 
arrested 
William Bryan Jr., the person 
who filmed the viral video of 
Arbery’s killing. 

In 
Washtenaw 
County, 
Sha’Teina 
Grady 
El 
was 
punched in the head multiple 
times by a police officer while 
her husband, Dan Grady El, was 
tased when both resisted being 
physically removed from the 
scene of a potential shooting. 
These are only some of the 
recent crimes of racism and 
police brutality.
Robert 
Sellers, 
chief 
diversity 
officer 
and 
vice 
provost 
for 
equity 
and 
inclusion at the University of 
Michigan, released a statement 
addressing 
recent 
events 
against the Black community 
titled “I Am So Tired.” In his 
address, Sellers detailed his 
sentiments of being African 
American in light of recent 
events and reflected on his 
parents’ guidance as a kid. 
“What my recollections of 
my parents’ example did do was 
provide me with a perspective, 
a lens through which I can 
view and understand all that is 
happening now,” Sellers wrote. 
“This lens reminds me that this 
struggle is not new, nor is it 
likely to be won in my life time. 
Sadly, it is likely that more 
Black people will die before 
we become the country that 
remotely resembles the one 
described in our constitution. 
This lens also reminds me that 
this country is MY country. My 
ancestors sacrificed their lives 
in building this country.”

About 500 march in 
Metro Detroit suburb


The University reported that 
emergency student funding from 
the 
federal 
Coronavirus 
Aid, 
Relief and Economic Security 
Act has been awarded to approxi-
mately 5 percent of eligible stu-
dents as of Tuesday.
The CARES Act, which offered 
emergency grants to institutions 
of higher education to counteract 
the effects of the pandemic, pro-
vided $25.2 million to the Univer-
sity of Michigan-Ann Arbor with 
the condition that at least half of 
the allocated funds be distributed 
to students for emergency finan-
cial aid. The act requires universi-
ties to report how many students 
received grants and how much 
funding has been distributed 30 
days after accepting the federal 
aid.
Students at the University who 
were eligible to receive support 
from the CARES Act funding 
received an email with the appli-
cation details in early May. The 
funds are intended to address 
COVID-19 expenses that arose 
after the outbreak.
The University published the 
current data on the Office of Bud-
get and Planning website on Tues-
day, reaffirming a minimum of 
$12,622,026 in emergency grants 
will go to students.
The page states $2,712,486 of 
the $12,622,026 has been awarded 
to students, about 21.49 percent of 
the total available financial aid. Of 
the estimated 39,388 eligible stu-
dents, 1,997 have received emer-
gency grants, which is roughly 5 
percent.
Several other large universities 
have already distributed a larger 
percentage of their emergency 
financial aid to a larger percent-
age of eligible students. The Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley 
reported 
it 
distributed 
about 
86.26 percent of its emergency 
aid mandated for students to 
68.38 percent of eligible students. 
Wayne State University disclosed 

they distributed 41.34 percent of 
its CARES funding to 32.28 per-
cent of eligible students. 
At 
Michigan 
State 
Univer-
sity, CARES funding has run out 
because 
applications 
request-
ing aid “far exceeded available 
dollars and the funds are now 
exhausted,” according to MSU’s 
Office of Financial Aid.
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
explained 
the 
administration 
is 
distributing 
the emergency funds with the 
intention of supporting eligible 
students from the winter 2020 
semester through winter 2021.
“The act instructs institutions 
to award funding for expenses 
related to COVID-19 caused by the 
disruption of campus instruction 
and to do so for the duration of 
one year,” Broekhuizen said. “The 
University is making decisions 
based on the needs expressed by 
applicants, their eligibility for 
funds and the University’s need to 
provide funds to a potential large 
number of students over a long 
period of time. The process will 
evolve as the University moves 
through the next year.”
In an email to The Daily, Pub-
lic Health student Anthony Dang 
said he applied to receive emer-
gency aid in early May because 
his paid internship opportunity, 
which would have covered his 
summer expenses, was canceled 
and he was only receiving a sti-
pend from a different internship. 
Dang received nearly the entire 
amount in funding he requested 
and said it would help cover his 
rent.
“Now that I have funding I am 
extremely relieved about surviv-
ing for the rest of the summer,” 
Dang wrote. “I was currently 
looking for a part-time job to do 
in addition to my full-time intern-
ship, but stopped at the moment 
knowing that I have these emer-
gency funds.”

Only a woman’s cry stopped the 
march that halted traffic along 
Washtenaw Avenue Thursday, as 
hundreds of community mem-
bers protested police brutality 
after a video surfaced of a white 
Washtenaw County sheriff’s dep-
uty appearing to punch Sha’Tenia 
Grady El, a Black woman, in the 
head multiple times during an 
arrest early Tuesday morning in 
Ypsilanti Township. As the sobs 
of Ypsilanti resident Ann Diggins, 
Grady El’s sister, pierced through 
the crowd, protesters paused. The 
drum beats and chants of “no jus-
tice, no peace” and “Black lives 
matter” fell silent. Then, after a few 
moments in her niece’s embrace, 
Diggins and the marchers pressed 
on. With a national spotlight 
focused on race and policing in the 
wake of George Floyd’s death, Dig-
gins said the recent incident in her 
hometown has not left her mind.
“I haven’t slept in three days,” 
Diggins said. “Every time I fucking 
close my eyes, all I fucking see is 
that man putting his hands on my 
sister, and I just can’t deal with it 
no more. I can’t hold in my anger. I 

tried and it’s not working. I’m try-
ing to do this shit the right way, and 
it’s not working.”
Organized by the non-profit Sur-
vivors Speak, the protesters first 
gathered at the Washtenaw County 
Sheriff’s Office in Ann Arbor to lis-
ten to speakers for about two hours, 
then marched onto Washtenaw 
Avenue and a surrounding neigh-
borhood. Police blocked off about a 
mile of Washtenaw Avenue, as well 
as both directions of U.S Highway 
23 overhead. 
Daniyal Grady El, Sha’Tenia’s 
husband, was tasered during the 
incident and also arrested early 
Tuesday morning. He said after he 
and his wife were released from 
the Washtenaw County Jail, the 
Taylor Police Department picked 
up Sha’Tenia to take her to Wayne 
County Jail on an alleged warrant. 
“Taylor (Police Department) had 
no reason to come pick her up after 
she just been abused,” Grady El said. 
“She should have been allowed to go 
to the hospital and take care of her-
self and get her wounds taken care 
of. And then for Taylor to send her 
to Wayne County, and have Wayne 
County wrap her up in their system 
is just ridiculous, especially during 
COVID-19. They’re not supposed to 
be bringing anybody new into the 
court system, into the jails, unless 
they’ve committed an actual crime. 
And so it’s just a travesty going on 
the legal system right now.”
According to a Facebook post, 

Sha’Tenia Grady El has been 
released from the Wayne County 
Jail as of Friday afternoon. 
Grady El also expressed anger 
and frustration at his wife’s treat-
ment in the initial incident. 
“Those police officers had no 
right to do anything that they did,” 
Grady El said. “The abuse, the pun-
ishment that she took at the hands 
of that officer and whoever else was 
involved with those officers should 
be handled in a correct manner, 
and not being investigated by their 
own people. They need to be inves-
tigated from outside.”
Jason Robinson, a pastor at 
Reach Church in Ypsilanti, said 
Floyd’s death in Minneapolis and 
the incident in Ypsilanti Town-
ship provoked the community to 
demand a change in policing cul-
ture. 
“If you have a culture where 
officers can step over that line, 
but there’s no repercussions, then 
it keeps happening over and over 
and over,” Robinson said. “But if 
you have a culture where people 
know the community will rise up, 
then officers will think twice about 
those 
moments 
of 
frustration, 
those moments of anger and just 
those moments of just downright 
racist bigotry in our communities. 
So the goal of it is creating a culture 
where this will not be tolerated.”

protesters. This disparity forces the finan-
cial hypocrisy of this country to light. In 
response to the jarring lack of PPE for 
healthcare workers, President Donald 
Trump stated, “the Federal government 
is not supposed to be out there buying 
vast amounts of items and then shipping 
… we’re not a shipping clerk.” However, 
he quickly changed tune when Ameri-
can citizens took to the streets to protest, 
mobilizing nearly a dozen federal agencies 
to “dominate” protesters. 

Right now, it is most important to stay 

safe and keep friends, community mem-
bers and loved ones safe as well. How-
ever, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board 
understands the boundless difficulties of 
doing just that when our country is fight-
ing both the COVID-19 pandemic and rac-
ism. The fact that Black communities are 
having to gather in large numbers during 
a pandemic to protest their right to stay 
alive, all the while being disproportion-
ately disposed to having higher rates of 
non-communicable diseases is not lost on 
us. This is why we, as an editorial board, 
encourage resourceful, respectful and safe 
protesting. 

Because of the pandemic, many indi-

viduals who would normally opt to prac-
tice activism in person at protests are not 
able to. This may be the result of immuno-
compromised family members, personal 
health reasons, working essential jobs, 
etc. If this is the case, there are many ways 
to protest unjust, racially oppressive sys-
tems from home. Considering donating 
to bailout funds for protesters who have 
been arrested, boycotting organizations 
or businesses that continue to perpetuate 
racism or exploit Black creators, research-
ing ways to stop offering funds to local 
policing agencies while simultaneously 
supporting Black businesses are some of 
the first steps one could make. 

Social media right now is a huge 

platform for activism, information and 
resources. It is imperative, however, to uti-
lize these platforms to the best of our abili-
ties. This includes active interactions with 
the media while trying to educate yourself 
and/or others about current events and 
how we can move forward. It is very easy 
to be passive when dealing with social 
media activism, a term designated “slack-
tivism,” which can, unfortunately, block 
access to important, helpful information. 
Consider the recent event of #blackout-
tuesday, where millions of Instagram 
users reposted a black square with the 
hashtags #blacklivesmatter, #blm or the 
aforementioned #blackouttuesday. This 
quickly clogged the media platform, which 
is an essential space for many individu-
als across the country to access real-time 
updates about protests or from friends or 
acquaintances, as well as spreading infor-
mation about resources, safety and what 
changes are being demanded.

While anyone is free to post what they 

want, within guidelines, on social media 
platforms, it is important to pay atten-
tion to what Black individuals are saying 
during this time. If you sincerely want to 
support protesters and the Black commu-
nity, it is necessary to examine your role in 
society and dig deeper into why these racial 

injustices continue to persist. On social 
media platforms right now, there are many 
resources made available and accessible for 
individuals looking to expand their under-
standing of topics of anti-racism. This 
includes education about the differences 
between structural vs. individual racism; 
a graphic about how the murder of George 
Floyd was just the tip of the iceberg; 
“how to donate to BLM when you have 
no money;” and comprehensive lists of 
books, films and podcasts you can invest 
in for the sake of your own consciousness 
on the systemic issue and millions of other 
resources. While the previous examples 
were all thought-provoking or called for 
active participation while channeling 
support (even if that means you just have 
to go to YouTube or Google and type in 
the link), many posts are much more per-
formative and allow passive, non-produc-
tive activism. While flooding feeds with 
trending posts may feel necessary to fit in 
or show your support for the movement, 
consider the content and the information 
that you are reposting and whether or not 
it is helpful to the audience you have on 
social media platforms. 

Protesting, showing support and activ-

ism can all be done in many different 
ways, especially because of the methods of 
organizing and communication we have 
that past generations have not had access 
to. Some are protesting in the streets, 
some are educating themselves, some 
are donating, some are having conversa-
tions with family members and friends. 
Now, we must begin to think about what 
we can all do moving forward and how we 
can channel productivity out of all forms of 
protest. How can we inspire those who are 
still opposed to the movement to join in? 
Can we have documented motives going 
into each protest? What elected officials 
can we contact to demand reforms? How 
can we incite change in our communities? 
These are all valid questions that constitute 
an institutionally complex, 400-year issue. 

Every successful protest and resis-

tance movement must adapt to address 
the unique circumstances into which 
it develops. Today that means meeting 
the demands of a pandemic that impacts 
everyone, but particularly exploits and 
ravages America’s most vulnerable com-
munities. This means continuing to lever-
age social media campaigns, defunding 
corporations and communities that are 
against the cause — a cause that is simply 
justice and a recognition of humanity in 
those who built our nation. This means 
fundraising for organizations that fight 
for protesters and supplying resources 
to those who need it most. As we build-
up to the 2020 election, that also means 
registering as many people to vote as pos-
sible and encouraging people to vote not 
just in a presidential election, but in their 
state and local ones as well. Galvanizing 
the spirit and power of the protests and 
converting them into political capital is 
crucial to passing progressive laws and 
policies that target corruption in law 
enforcement. Finally, speaking up about 
racial injustice, with friends, family and in 
every community is a must if America is to 
even begin to purge racism from its ranks.

T

he unjust death of Floyd is not 
an isolated incident by any 
means, nor is it unprecedent-

ed, nor should it be a surprise to any-
one who has access to news and media 
outlets — this is a tale as old as time, one 
that has happened to an unfathomable 
number of intersectional Black citizens. 
Closer to the University of Michigan’s 
campus, in Ypsilanti, Mich., protesters 
gathered on the afternoon of Tuesday, 
May 26, after a video was circulated 
showing a white police officer punch-
ing Sha’Teina Grady El, a Black woman, 
in the head multiple times. 

Building awareness about and a con-

sensus against these horrific, racist acts of 
violence has to be a priority. But doing 
so safely and effectively is important 
as a pandemic rages on and police 
departments continue to aggressively 
crackdown on those who speak truth 
to their power. 

First, it is imperative to offer a his-

torical context into the nature of policing 
agencies in America when wanting to 
approach conversations about the cur-
rent Black Lives Matter protests occur-
ring across America and around the 
world. The birth of modern-day police 
officers in America can be traced to a 
multitude of political, economic, legal and 
historical conditions. Most importantly, 
perhaps, modern policing departments 
can be traced to slave patrols and night 
watch groups, which were both mali-
ciously designed to control the behaviors 

and freedoms of minorities — most nota-
bly Black and Native Americans. In the 
southern colonies of the United States 
especially, origins of policing were rooted 
in racialized social orders and in the econ-
omy that so heavily depended on individ-
uals that were enslaved. Slave patrols and 
night watches assisted wealthy landown-
ers and maintained economic order by 
recovering and punishing both enslaved 
and freed Black individuals who did not 
adhere to white societal standards. 

The vicious and abhorrent rationaliza-

tions of slavery and racism did not end 
after the 13th amendment abolished slav-
ery in the U.S. With the rise of so-called 
vigilante groups who resisted abolition 
and Reconstruction after the Civil War, 
America continued to perpetuate deep 
racism, oppression and injustice toward 
Black Americans. Due to the traditions 
of slavery and racism that are, unfortu-
nately, so deeply embedded within this 
country’s history, these vigilante groups 
felt it their duty to uphold the narrative 
that Black individuals were sub-human. 

Coinciding with the onset of the 

second phase of post-Civil War Recon-
struction, the most infamous vigilante 
group, the Ku Klux Klan, was founded. 
Notorious for brutal campaigns of vio-
lence against Black individuals, “local 
law 
enforcement 
officials 
either 

belonged to the Klan or declined to take 
action against it.” Due to law enforce-
ment’s involvement with the infamous 
group, Congress eventually passed the 

Enforcement Act of May 1870 and two 
more Force acts — also known as the Ku 
Klux Klan acts — which acted to prohib-
it the assembly of groups with the inten-
tion of violating constitutional rights of 
minority groups. However, this legisla-
tion, along with many more legal events, 
has not suppressed the inhumane prac-
tices of racial abuse and oppression that 
have persisted in America. 

Today, we are witnessing the con-

tinued perpetuation of racial injustices 
and violence from modern-day institu-
tions against Black Americans. From 
being disproportionately affected by 
health inequalities that have been made 
most apparent during COVID-19 to 
repetitive injustices perpetuated by the 
criminal justice systems in America, it 
is clear that what has been done so far 
is not nearly enough. During this global 
pandemic, many disparities and corrupt 
systems have come to light — ranging 
from the exploitations of essential work-
ers who are primarily POC to healthcare 
inequalities and biases to precariously 
unfair shortages of protective equip-
ment for frontline workers — which 
has undeniably showcased where 
the values of our country’s leaders lie.

While our healthcare workers are 

“at war with no ammo” — forced to use 
expired masks and perform invasive pro-
cedures on COVID-19 patients without 
any personal protective equipment — local 
police forces tout a saturation of protec-
tive gear and riot gear when confronting

OPINION

A

s you consider joining the ranks 
of the leaders and the best, 
I can’t, in good conscience, 
allow you to make the decision to come 
to the University of Michigan without 
taking the time to share this with you. 
As someone who chose to come to the 
University, I know how exciting it is to 
envision yourself here. Scrolling through 
the websites and social media accounts, 
you’ll see game days, students in our 
esteemed research labs and photos of 
multicultural student groups on the 
Diag. However, what you won’t see is a 
university fulfilling its stated mission.
I decided to come to the University 
after attending Hawken School, a small 
private high school in Ohio. Most of the 
students who attended the school, like 
me, were white and entered the school 
unaware of the systems of oppression 
that affected the people of color in our 
community. Hawken took responsibil-
ity for developing our understanding of 
race, vulnerability and of every citizen’s 
responsibility to be an active member of 
society and an ally in the fight against 
issues they don’t directly experience. As 
a result of the institution’s efforts, I felt 
compelled to find a college where I could 
further develop my understanding and 
leadership on broader societal justice. 
I decided to attend the University 
because I wanted to learn how to tackle 
these issues of privilege and racism at an 
institution whose mission is “to serve 
the people of Michigan and the world 
through preeminence in creating, com-
municating, preserving and applying 
knowledge, art and academic values, 
and in developing leaders and citizens 
who will challenge the present and 
enrich the future.” As I’ve been attend-
ing the University for two years, there 
certainly have been moments where I 
have learned about race, being a global 
citizen and what real leadership looks 
like. Student-led initiatives like the Musi-
cal Theatre Department’s Color Cabaret 
create an environment of vulnerable, 
open and genuine discussion on race in 
society while simultaneously celebrating 
the diverse background of the student 
body. You may think this is because the 
administration at the University takes 
broad and resolute action to support 
the mission of the institution and fos-
ter diversity, equity and inclusiveness. 
However, in times like these, when we 
need leadership the most, the University 
is teaching us that leaders wait until it is 
comfortable to get behind an issue, while 
the best stand silently by, afraid to upset 
the status quo.
After over 300 hundred people 
accessed an email template that I created 
to send a message to University President 
Mark Schlissel from the student body, 
Schlissel offered an obligatory message 

that amounted to a general acknowledg-
ment of work to be done against racism 
and violence, but failed to highlight any 
concrete accomplishments or cite any 
new efforts by the University to fulfill 
its institutional obligation. In 2016, The 
Michigan Daily reported on the pro-
posed Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
goals Schlissel mentions in his recent 
statement, saying “DEI will continue as a 
major focus of the institution throughout 
my presidency, beyond our initial five-
year Strategic Plan.” Sabrina Bilimoria, 
who graduated in 2016 and was a Michi-
gan in Color editor at The Daily, criti-
cized the DEI plan which required more 
mental and emotional labor from mar-
ginalized students. She wrote, “There’s 
such a lack of understanding from Schlis-
sel and many, many administrators as to 
a common way to talk to students with-
out tokenizing them and asking minority 
students to do all the work.” Four years 
later, the University continues to put the 
burden on minority students to educate 
their white peers on race and allyship by 
remaining absent in the discussion. It is 
not Black people’s responsibility to teach 
white people how to understand race. 
Understanding race is a fundamental 
component of citizenship and if the Uni-
versity actually intends to fulfill its mis-
sion, one driven by creating leaders and 
citizens, it should take steps to develop 
and lead these discussions to truly fur-
ther intellectual diversity, equity and the 
teaching of racial justice for the entire 
student body.
Other universities across the country 
have already taken action to support 
Black students and the Black com-
munities within their sphere of influ-
ence: The Manhattan School of Music 
pledged that “all performances will 
feature work by African American cre-
ators or those from the African diaspo-
ra,” while the University of California 
stated that, “As part of our commitment 
to find solutions to address these issues, 
the University of California will take 
immediate action to re-examine our 
own practices and ensure we imple-
ment the recommendations of the Pres-
idential Task Force on Universitywide 
Policing that we established two years 
ago.” The University of Michigan, how-
ever, appears to be focusing more on 
continuing inadequate commitments 
than reexamining what these commit-
ments fail to achieve and how to prog-
ress towards racial justice.

KEITH JOHNSTONE | COLUMNIST

“

An individual has not 
started living until he 
can rise above the nar-
row confines of his individu-
alistic concerns to the broader 
concerns of all humanity.” — 
Martin Luther King Jr.
In my columns, I attempt to 
stay facially neutral about my 
personal 
background 
when 
it comes to political issues, 
trying my hardest to give the 
untouched facts about an issue 
or political figure to lead read-
ers to my conclusion, usually 
with a sarcastic comment or 
two along the way. However, 
with this column, I think my 
personal story is important 
because, when I watched for-
mer Vice President Joe Biden 
make his comments on The 
Breakfast Club, no matter how 
hard I tried, I did not see them 
through a journalistic, impar-
tial lens. I did not see them as 
a liberal voter who wants to 
see progressive changes made 
in government. I did not see 
them as an American citizen 
who loves this country despite 
this dark era that we are all 
experiencing together.
I saw the comment as a 
Black man who has been 
made fun of for wearing my 
naturally curly hair inside of 
the University of Michigan’s 
Ross School of Business. I saw 
these comments as a Black 
man who never felt at home in 
the rich white suburbs where 
I grew up. For my entire life, 
people have told me that I do 
not belong, no matter where 
I am, that I am somehow less 
than human because of the 
color of my skin, and hear-
ing a white man say that some 
people “ain’t Black” because of 
their voting patterns sickened 
me. Biden has no place telling 
anyone how Black they are for 
countless reasons, chief among 
them is that he ain’t Black and 
could never be. Until he has 
walked in the shoes of a Black 
man or woman, he cannot pass 
judgment on a single one of my 
brothers or sisters. Blackness is 
a much deeper issue than your 
vote for the presidency or the 
language you use or the music 
you listen to. In my opinion, 
the true measure of Blackness 
is how the world interprets 
you and how you interpret the 
world, and no vote can take 
this life experience away.

Your vote for the presi-
dency may not define your 
Blackness, but it does define 
something much more cen-
tral to your character. As my 
granny said, “it don’t matter 
whether you’re Black, white 
or Puerto Rican, as long 
as you’ve got heart,” and I 
believe that, at its core, heart 
is really what’s on the ballot 
this November. Sure, Biden 
has professed that his cabinet 
would “look like the country,” 
meaning having more diversi-
ty than the people in Trump’s 
cabinet like clammy-handed, 
lying, unqualified Ben Carson 
and Elaine Chao, the woman 
who gets to be Mitch McCo-
nnell’s wife. However, as a 
middle-class person myself, I 
understand the selfish argu-
ment that Trump lowered our 
taxes and brought unemploy-
ment, especially Black unem-
ployment, to an all-time low. 
However, 
these 
were 
results of the Obama Admin-
istration — of which Biden 
was a critical part — and 
its economic recovery plan 
after 
the 
financial 
crisis. 
Also, a little thing called the 
COVID-19 pandemic — which 
has disproportionately bur-
dened minority communities 
in part due to the Department 
of Health and Human Servic-
es guidelines making it more 
difficult for people to receive 
health insurance — wiped 
out that record. Addition-
ally, Trump’s administration 
has made it more difficult 
for both documented and 
undocumented 
immigrants, 
who have been proven to 
boost economic productiv-
ity, to enter this country. The 
administration has widened 
the latitude of prosecuto-
rial 
sentencing 
discretion, 
and they have nonsensically 
tightened the already inef-
fective work requirements on 
food assistance while encour-
aging work requirements for 
Medicaid. 
These discriminatory poli-
cies are all targeted specifi-
cally at communities of color 
and, while I get the allure 
of a tax cut, I believe hav-
ing heart means looking out 
for people beyond yourself, 
beyond even your immedi-
ate community, to look at the 
greater good. 

So, yes, if you vote for Don-
ald Trump, you are still Black, 
but you show a fundamental 
disregard for your brothers 
and sisters, and you ought to 
consider the thousands you 
are robbing of opportunities 
before condemning them to 
the very life that our ancestors 
fought to prevent.
In the end, while extremely 
insensitive, #YouAintBlack is 
not a symbol of Biden or any-
one in the Democratic Party 
taking our community’s vote 
for granted. In fact, I think it 
is quite the opposite. The mere 
fact that Biden, Pete Buttigieg 
and Elizabeth Warren have 
all been on the same radio 
show whose previous content 
includes Soulja Boy roasting 
Drake — which is by far the 
most savage thing I’ve ever 
seen — is a remarkable testa-
ment to how much Democrats 
value the opinions of Black 
voters in 2020. See, when voter 
turnout in the Black commu-
nity fell in 2016, propelling 
us into the era of the pornstar 
president with perfectly nor-
mal-sized hands (wink wink), 
I believe the Democratic Party 
woke up to the fact that Black 
voters make this party what it 
is today and we could destroy 
it if we stopped participating. 
Maybe the Democratic Party 
learning that lesson is the one 
good thing to come out of the 
Trump era.
Look, at the end of the day, 
I got lucky. I was born into a 
family with two parents, two 
sisters and two dogs who have 
all loved and cared for me 
my entire life. Because of my 
ancestors’ sacrifices, I was 
born free and, because of my 
own actions, I have lived free. 
However, not a second goes by 
where I am unaware that with 
one bad judgment call or one 
bad financial decision, that 
freedom can be taken from me 
and I could be left at the mercy 
of our government. Though 
I have not fallen victim to 
these circumstances, many of 
my brothers and sisters have 
and, for them, it is my duty to 
vote for a president who cares. 
This is why I am Black, and I 
am voting for Joe Biden. If you 
have a heart, you should too.

Joe ain’t Black, but he needs us and we need him

It’s said that every theater is inhab-
ited by at least one ghost, and contrary to 
legends propagated by Halloween, these 
ghosts do not like the dark. Thus, when the 
curtain falls and a theater’s house empties, 
an employee will leave a light — a ghost 
light — to burn onstage until the performers 
return. Across the world, ghost lights have 
remained on and untouched for months. But 
the lives of performers continue offstage, 
each day adding pressure to find perfor-
mance spaces on digital platforms. What 
happens when the ghost lights keep burning 
and we’re left with a stage wholly mediated 
by posts, shares, comments and likes? 
In a utopian alternate reality of a world 
without coronavirus, this week would 
have been quite historic for American 
Ballet Theater. Dancers Misty Copeland 
and Calvin Royal III were scheduled to 
become the first black artists at ABT 
to headline the archetypal love story 
“Romeo and Juliet” together. The casting 
would have been the newest in the ballet 
world’s glacially slow-moving progress 
toward a more diverse stage. Copeland 
recently told ABT Trustee Emerita Susan 
Fales-Hill that when social distancing 
necessities dissipate, the performance 
will have the potential to shift an audi-
ence’s perspective on black love, elabo-
rating that “I just think it’s going to blow 
people’s minds just by seeing two brown 
bodies in this romantic, passionate young 
love that has nothing to do with the color 
of our skin.” 
The specialness of this potential should 
not be minimized — quite frankly, the 
mere fact that ABT has two black danc-
ers high enough in its ranks to cast such 

major roles makes the company far ahead 
of many others. In 2015, Copeland became 
the first ever black female principal danc-
er at any major international company and 
since then, the success stories have been 
few and far between. 
Ballet’s history is fraught with racial 
prejudice. For generations, the art form 
was emblematic of a white aristocracy 
that firmly denied access to audiences and 
dancers of color. It began in the courts of 
Italy and was later codified by King Louis 
XIV of France in the 17th century. These 
blue-blooded beginnings helped support 
an aura of elitism that continues to hinder 
ballet’s potential for growth from racial 
and socioeconomic standpoints. Today, 
ballet’s lack of diversity is fed by ugly ste-
reotypes of black artists’ supposed lack of 
grace, and its expensive point of entry can 
make it hard for new talent to break these 
boundaries — one estimate projected that 
a dancer-in-training will need at least 
$100,000 before reaching the possibil-
ity of a professional audition. This reality 
creates a world that continues to exclude 
and oppress dancers of color. 
This oppression is currently backlit by a 
country enveloped by protests against the 
recent murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud 
Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Activists and 
Instagram users alike continue to use 
these crimes as platforms to talk about 
the importance of fighting racial injus-
tice at every level — ballet may be far 
removed from police brutality, but the art 
form remains at the center of many sys-
tems of white privilege that also enable 
the perpetuation of racism in America 
and beyond. The layers of that privilege 
run far deeper than just casting, but the 
stage is almost always where choreogra-
phers, teachers and directors get their 
start. Changing the racial makeup of a 

I sat in our firewood-scented Wisconsin cabin 
and stared at a Zoom video conference call meant 
to resemble my friend Stephany’s 19th birthday 
party. College friends, childhood friends, room-
mates and classmates were fit awkwardly together 
like puzzle pieces on my computer screen, patient-
ly awaiting the birthday girl’s arrival. We made 
conversation and exchanged niceties like business 
colleagues might do, offering a “what’s everyone 
been up to?” when the silence grew to be par-
ticularly uncomfortable. Finally, Stephany’s sweet 
face entered the Zoom call and we launched into a 
timidly performed rendition of “Happy Birthday,” 
single voices freezing here and there as Zoom’s lag 
emphasized the inherently awkward nature of the 
festivity.
Like what many others in Generation Z, more 
recently labeled as “Generation Zoom,” have expe-
rienced, Steph’s birthday party was the umpteenth 
Zoom event I had attended since first submit-
ting to self-quarantine in mid-March. Virtual cast 
reunions, get-togethers and club meetings meant 
that Zoom has become my new and sole place for 
social gathering. With other Gen Zers frequenting 
the platform to participate in religious services, 
movie viewings, club parties and even drinking 
games, college students have fully immersed them-
selves in this new form of digital socialization. 
Seemingly overnight, self-proclaimed “quar-
anteens” traded in sweaty bar crawls and packed 
house parties for Zoom links and Facebook events. 
Throughout the month of March, a new genre 
of Zoom-centered Facebook groups including 
one called “Zoom Hangouts for Self Quranteens” 
introduced such events like “4/20 on ZOOM” 
and “Zoom Bingo” to those searching for con-
nection while quarantined. One Facebook event 
called “How many ppl can we get in a zoom call in 
a week” appealed to those lonely, socially starved 
Gen Zers searching for a place to meet new peo-
ple, play drinking games and commiserate over 
COVID-19.
But on March 25, this desperate pursuit of 
human connection proved to extend beyond 
Zoom Bingo nights and virtual parties when stu-
dents flocked to an online dating website called 
thezoomuniversity.com to find love. Co-founded 
by USC graduates Leor Massachi and Daniel 
Newman, the initial idea behind the website was 
to organize video double dates to combat the “...
unprecedented levels of loneliness” Newman and 
Massachi knew college students were experienc-
ing during quarantine. After going viral on TikTok, 
the website attracted tens of thousands of users 
hailing from colleges all over the country. Soon, 
the website servers crashed and Massachi and 
Newman scrambled to meet the romantic needs 
of thousands of quarantined students.

ballet’s performance thus has the long-
term potential to shape the entire indus-
try going forward.
Misty Copeland is perhaps the loudest 
voice in this fight today — even before her 
official promotion, Copeland’s status as 
a powerful black ballerina changed the 
landscape of ballet audiences. In 2014, she 
became a spokesperson for Under Armour 
and broke out of ballet’s insular bubble in 
a way that few dancers ever have. Cope-
land pushed the ballet community to see 
the importance of growth and became the 
face of ballet’s progressive fans. Never-
theless, she is not the only voice out there: 
ABT’s Erica Lal and Calvin Royal III, 
Houston Ballet’s Harper Watters, Wash-
ington Ballet’s Nardia Boodoo and Dance 
Theatre of Harlem’s Daphne Lee are all 
beautiful voices to listen to. Lee recently 
told her followers, “We could cripple this 
country. We could also elevate it in ways 
we haven’t done before.” 
Copeland and Royal III’s performance 
of “Romeo and Juliet” would have been 
special for its elevation of ballet’s pos-
sibilities: They were both eager to show 
the world a new face on an old story. This 
excitement is melancholic in context 
of the uncertain future of live perfor-
mance, but both express confidence that 
this groundbreaking show will happen 
one day. Their conviction is an optimistic 
reflection of how far the ballet world has 
come, yet the mere necessity of delaying 
such a milestone in 2020, especially this 
week, underscores how much further it 
needs to go. 
In the wake of these events, ballet com-
panies are also taking stances — Lincoln 
Center cancelled this week’s scheduled 
live streams in honor of the Blackout 
Tuesday media initiative under the grow-
ing 
hashtag 
#TheShowMustBePaused. 
Last Sunday, ABT joined the also-growing 
#BalletRelevesForBlackLives initiative to 
address the racism lingering in the ballet 
industry. A réleve is a step in which the 
dancer pulls their body up onto the ball 
of their foot or the top of the pointe shoe. 
The simple yet powerful step is the back-
bone of many of ballet’s most important 
movements. In essence, these companies 
are pledging to step up, to grow and to lift 
their world into a more racially equitable 
tomorrow. 
The sentiment is quite beautiful: By 
hiring more black dancers, those dancers 
then have the opportunities to grow into 
choreographers, teachers and directors. 
The pledge has the potential to change 
the future of this art form, but only if 
these companies follow through on their 
words. Just like a réleve itself, change 
requires strength that comes from long 
stretches of active perseverance — words 
and hashtags are only the trailhead of a 
steep road of effort. Also like a réleve, that 
road needs to become the backbone of this 
industry if real change is to be enacted. 
Black lives and black dancers must matter 
today, tomorrow and forever to come.

Kip Moore’s earthy, 
varied ‘Wild World’

Kip Moore entered my life the way most 
country singers did in 2011 — by singing about a 
truck. More precisely, “Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck.” 
For months on end the cheeky, feel-good track 
was playing every time I turned on the radio. 
Successful follow-up singles “Beer Money” and 
“Hey Pretty Girl” ostensibly signalled Kip’s com-
ing country stardom. Until, of course, they didn’t. 
Nine years later, Wild World finds a contempla-
tive Kip carving out a thoughtful plot of country 
music for himself outside of Nashville — a star 
unrealized, but a star nonetheless.
The new Kip Moore is gritty. In 
his current single “Red White Blue 
Jean American Dream,” Moore 
traces artists’ pilgrimages across 
America, but having grown out his 
hair and traded in baseball caps 
for beanies, it’s clear the former Nashville cookie 
cutter has gone on a self-actualization journey of 
his own. “Dylan went to New York, Cash went to 
Nashville / Mark Twain floated on the Mississippi 
Queen” he chants. I imagine an autobiographical 
addition to the song going like this: Moore went to 
Red River Gorge, Kentucky. 
That’s where we find him in Wild World’s 
promotional documentary “7 Days at the Rock.” 
While some clips could be mistaken for a luxury 
outdoors-wear commercial, I was stunned by how 
closely certain images resembled the texture I had 
imagined listening to Moore’s album. At one point, 
Kip sits in a rustic-looking rocking chair while sip-
ping black coffee, strumming along to the sounds 
of the woods and playing for a cat called Boots. 
And yet, Kip Moore is no Tyler Childers. 
Despite planting roots in Appalachia, Wild 
World’s sound is recognizably mainstream. With 
crisp production that favors electric guitar riffs 
and arena-ready drums over fiddle solos, there’s 
no mistaking Kip’s music for Americana. But his 
raspy voice and use of recognizably real instru-

ments means Moore doesn’t sound pop either. 
Instead, Kip’s country music lands closer to rock. 
Still, Wild World’s earthy tones aren’t accidental, 
but align with the richness of its stories. 
“
Janie Blu” outlines the trappings of a strained 
relationship and addiction. “Southpaw” serves as 
Moore’s “gunslinging” mission statement. “Fire or 
Flame” watches Kip wrestle not with faith, but his 
inclination to ramble toward the light and trouble. 
“He took my hand, I shook it free” he smirks. 
And those are just the first three songs. “It’s a 
wild world,” Moore claims in the title track, so he 
promises to “stay wild” too.
Rock climbing, surfing, skateboarding — “7 
Days at the Rock” shows how 
dedicated Moore is to keeping that 
promise. What it fails to show how-
ever, is any desire Kip might have to 
get back to the top of the country 
charts. The hopeful “She’s Mine” 
and rollicking “South” both reveal 
glimmers of the Kip we met in 2011. These songs 
have the kind of bouncy, up-beat production and 
sing-along ready lyrics that once upon a time 
would have made for country radio gold. 
Near the end of “7 Days at the Rock,” Moore 
starts singing unaccompanied while staring sol-
emnly into a fire pit. “Payin’ Hard” details his 
regret about lost love and lost time with his late 
father from playing shows instead. “My life’s a 
credit card / play now, pay later and I’m payin’ 
hard” he whispers, presumably to himself, his 
voice cracking alongside the fire. As sentimental 
as it sounds — it works. Moore’s quasi-outsider 
status makes his lows feel more relatable than 
those of his hitmaker peers.
The landscape of Moore’s Wild World is practi-
cally devoid of trucks, beer and explicitly “pretty 
girls.” But that’s not why I was so taken by it. 
Country radio is a finicky beast and it made Moore 
a different kind of outlaw. He was spit out of the 
Nashville scene just as quickly as he was taken in. 
Lucky for us, some things grow better in the dark 
— Kip Moore is one of them.

Watercolor: a guide

This piece is part of a series on “Art dur-
ing COVID,” an exploration of art forms 
to keep our idle minds creative during this 
pandemic. With many of us at home, our 
minds have ample time to wander, wonder 
and create. This series highlights accessi-
ble and immersive art forms to both pro-
duce and consume during the pandemic 
months and beyond.
How do we show our gratitude for the 
world around us? 
It’s a question that’s been on my mind 
recently. As spring reaches its full force, 
the world begs for my attention. I can 
admire the deep pink eastern rosebuds, 
the velvety white crabapples, the com-
forting pale lilacs, but how do I give 
back? 
For most of my life, this exchange 
with the world has felt one-dimension-
al: The Earth provides food, shelter, air, 
water, beauty, and all I can do is admire 
in response. I do plenty to advocate for 
the Earth on a macro scale — recycling, 
composting, repurposing. I believe this 
is easier to do: With some effort, anyone 
can do their part to reduce their carbon 
footprint. But what about showing grati-
tude for the Earth on a micro scale? How 
often do we thank a tree we pass for giv-
ing us clean air and water, or think of the 
life behind a flower before planting it in 
our garden? These small-scale interac-
tions make up the bigger whole — eco-
systems and biomes — that we tend to 
focus more on. We can’t truly love our 
planet without paying attention to the 
little things. 
Watercolor is one of my humble 
attempts to show my appreciation for 
these small wonders. Painting a tree, 
a leaf, even a blade of grass, shows the 
world that I’m thinking about it and lis-
tening to its calls. Of all wet and dry art 
forms, the effortless contours and gradi-
ents of watercolor makes it my favorite 
for representing the natural world. It’s 
fast, fills up a space quickly with color 
and begs us not to overthink our strokes. 
It’s raw. It’s natural. 
As quarantine leaves us with large 
pockets of empty time, watercolor is 
an undemanding way to fill that space 
with color and life. Representing a liv-
ing form that’s not your own reminds us 
that we’re not truly isolated when life 
beckons us from all directions. Yet, for 
all its benefits, watercolor can be one of 
the most intimidating art mediums for 
beginners. I remember agonizing over 
where to place colors, confused by how 
much water was too much and how much 
was too little. It would be insulting to 
reduce watercolor to a science, as there’s 
no correct method, but the steps below 

can be helpful to get started. 
Watercolor doesn’t demand much. The 
paints come in two forms — in tubes or in 
a pan. If you’re painting on the go, por-
table palettes offer a generous array of 
colors, complete with a water brush and 
mixing compartments. My Reeves water-
color set has served me well over the 
years, but any set is fine, coupled with 
watercolor paper and a brush.
Pick a subject, but not just anything. 
Pick something with meaning to you, 
a form that you could spend at least a 
paragraph describing. I inevitably draw 
my inspiration from the environment, 
oftentimes while sitting on my drive-
way. Yesterday, I painted the maple tree 
in my yard whose branches gently touch 
the roof of my car. Maple trees weave 
together my relationship with Michigan 
and my infatuation with the fall colors 
of our deciduous landscape. Pick some-
thing that feels like home. 
The first streak of color feels glori-
ous. I like to wet my brush, dab on a little 
color and glide it across the page. Water-
color fills up space easily and doesn’t 
give you much time to think. I focus 
on the bigger picture instead of worry-
ing about each individual brush stroke. 
I liken this to zooming out my perspec-
tive, trying to represent a general shape 
first before painting fine details. I lose 
myself in the immediate satisfaction of 
color breathing my image to life. I let the 
excess water spill over slightly, which 
gives me a base to continue building 
color.
I let my first layer of paint dry before 
piling more on top, making each layer 
progressively darker than the last. Shad-
ing adds depth to your work; pools of 
black and slashes of white make an 
image seem real. I find it helpful to pick 
a direction of light — the upper right cor-
ner of the page, for example — and paint 
everything closer to this point lighter, as 
if the light was hitting the object. Every-
thing farther away should be darker, in 
shadow. 
Once I start adding other colors to the 
mix, it’s aimless to try and describe a 
methodology. There are no rules. 
When I succumb to the power of 
watercolor, I feel connected to the Earth, 
grounded to my colors, clear in my mind. 
It’s my way of acknowledging the small 
lives around us — the beetle climbing 
over mounds of earth, the peonies in full 
bloom, the branches shimmering in the 
light. I paint from a place of intangible 
gratitude, giving thanks and remem-
brance to our Earth. If your paintings 
come from a place of love, you’ve suc-
ceeded.

Ok, America. Prove me wrong.

At the turn of the 2010s, the 
ingenious use of social media by 
young activists during the Arab 
Spring set the world ablaze. In 
the blink of an eye, young people 
transformed social media from a 
prom picture party hub to an outlet 
of 
revolutionary 
information. 
Via 
fledgling 
platforms 
like 
Facebook 
and 
Twitter, 
users 
shared demonstration sites, tear 
gas remedies and even tips to avoid 
identification by authorities should 
one choose to participate in civil 
disobedience. 
With 
its 
unprecedented 
ability to deliver not only crucial 
information, but also the sights, 
sounds and unmistakable aura of 
social upheaval to the palm of any 
user’s hand, social media seemed to 
be the last missing link to achieving 
real global equality. 
In case you missed it, the 2010s 
were not quite the pax romana we 
hoped they would be.

A brief Black and A/PIA history under
white supremacy

CHERYN HONG
MiC Managing Editor

On May 25, the Minneapolis 
police officers Derek Chauvin, J 
Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and 
Thomas Lane arrested George 
Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man 
accused of buying cigarettes with a 
counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin, who 
spent almost nine minutes kneeling 
on Floyd’s neck, was charged with 
third degree murder and second 
degree manslaughter. The three 
other officers who were complicit 
and silent during the arrest were 
fired but not arrested. As of today, 
Chauvin’s charge got upgraded to 
second-degree murder, and the 
other three were arrested and 
charges with aided and abetted 
murder
While many have been protesting 
Chauvin 
and 
the 
Minneapolis 
police department who have been 
known to tolerate racism, Tou 
Thao, the Hmong officer who also 
has a history of involvement in use-
of-force incidents, has become the 
symbol of Asian-American silence 
in anti-Blackness sentiment in 
America. Thao has resparked the 
ongoing discussion of minority 

Just shy of a decade after the 
events of the Arab Spring, social 
media’s stature as a beacon of 
hope, 
a 
catalyst 
of 
universal 
change has undergone quite the 
reversal. As Generation Z came of 
age over the course of the 2010s, 
we watched in real time as the 
sanctity of information found and 
distributed on social media was 
forever compromised. In addition 
to issues with misinformation, 
overwhelmingly, 
the 
outward 
facing nature of these platforms 
spawned a culture of normalized 
“slacktivism,” 
wherein 
the 
cultivation of the image of being 
“woke” by privileged groups has 
taken precedence over the actual 
substance of the societal issues 
which predicates such activism. 
The issues most often co-opted 
for social clout are related to the 
continued extrajudicial murder of 
countless Black Americans. But, 
this shouldn’t come as much of a 
surprise for a country which enjoys 
its temporary forays into Black 

culture more than Miley Cyrus. 
More so than any other instance 
of Black-led rebellion seen in the 
previous decade, the most recent 
uprisings beginning on May 26 
have been characterized by a 
suspiciously high amount of white 
endorsement 
and 
participation. 
But, these were not the usual 
white allies — these were white 
moderates. In the past week, 
my 
social 
media 
feeds 
have 
been flooded with the feverish 
reposting of artist’s renditions of 
the deceased, text posts demanding 
accountability on the part of all non-
Black Americans and of course, the 
black tiles. Although an increased 
awareness of the horrors of police 
brutality appears, superficially, to 
be indicative of promising social 
progress, I cannot help but shake 
my suspicions that these displays — 
like most things on social media — 
are just a part of a facade. 
While my skepticism could be 
misconstrued as a selfish attempt 
to “gatekeep” who can and cannot 

be politically active, in reality, 
this cynicism is a byproduct of 
coming of age in the span of years 
separating Trayvon Martin from 
George Floyd, Ferguson from Flint 
and Obama from Trump. Through 
these years, time and time again 
in school, and even in some social 
situations, I was looked to by my 
non-Black peers to rationalize why 
“all lives” and “blue lives” did not 
matter and why violence sometimes 
could be the only appropriate 
answer. And with each repetition of 
this cycle, with every new Black life 
taken prematurely, the same peers 
still refused to educate themselves 
any further than the information 
that was already laboriously spoon-
fed to them by young Black people 
like myself, just clamoring to make 
their people’s humanity known. 
As I observed the same people 
who were once “so concerned” 
with educating themselves retreat 
back to the comfortability of their 
privileged 
existences 
at 
their 
convenience, I began to see my 

efforts to inform had not just fallen 
on deaf ears, but actually replicated 
the existing system of
Black subjugation to whiteness 
— where still, Black labor is readily 
substituted in the place of white 
effort. 
Although 
many 
white 
Americans — particularly Gen Z’ers 
too self-righteous to recognize 
their own similarities to their 
Boomer grandparents—are quick to 
ridicule the glaring hypocrisies of 
attempts to appear “of the people” 
by a Kendall Jenner or Gal Gadot, 
significantly fewer conversations 
are 
being 
had 
regarding 
the 
abruptness 
with 
which 
they 
themselves hop on the bandwagon 
of social responsibility, only to 
retreat back into the complicit 
silence of their “normal” existences 
once their friends stop posting 
Instagram stories, hashtags stop 
trending and the media moves on... 

tensions and relations, especially 
between the Black and Asian 
community. 
When Asian Americans first 
began to immigrate to the United 
States, they were also a large 
target for white supremacy, as 
the 
government 
passed 
racist 
legislation such as the Chinese 

Exclusion Act, fueled the anti-
Japanese movement in the early 
1900s and repeatedly refused to 
grant citizenship to Asians who 
don’t fit the “white” requirement.
However, as time went on, the 
white supremacy transformed. As 
fear that anti-Asian racism could 
jeopardize the country’s world 

leader status and impeded imperial 
expansion, white liberals sought to 
efface Asian exclusion legislation 
during and after World War II. The 
government believed there would 
be a geopolitical payoff in return 
for recognizing Asian Americans 
as “model” citizens, thus a mixture 
of geopolitics, the Cold War and the 

civil rights movement gave birth to 
the “model minority myth.” 
Between 1940 and 1970, Asian 
Americans 
surpassed 
Black 
Americans in average household 
earnings, and also closed the wage 
gap with whites. This was because 
at the beginning of the 20th century, 
Asian Americans were depicted as 
threatening, exotic and degenerate. 
However due to the model minority 
myth, newspapers glorified Asian 
Americans as industrious, law-
abiding citizens who were docile 
and never complained. This wasn’t 
a special tactic, as many minorities 
in the U.S. attempted to combat 
racism by portraying themselves 
as upstanding citizens capable 
of assimilating themselves into 
American 
mainstream 
culture. 
Chinese Americans promoted their 
obedient children and traditional 
family values, Japanese Americans 
referred to their wartime service 
and, while Black Americans also 
made similar appeals, postwar 
America made it convenient for 
political leaders to solely listen to 
the Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders community.

The Arab/Muslim role 
in dismantling Anti-
Black racism

MAYA MOKH
MiC Staff Writer

I address my community not from a place 
of guilt, as I, too, have been there and found it 
to be unproductive and paralyzing. I address 
my community from a place of love and 
urgency. 
We non-Black Arabs, especially those of 
us with proximity to whiteness, have played 
an immense role in the anti-Blackness and 
colorism which pervades our communities 
and contributes to the degradation of Black 
people. Those of us who live in Dearborn are 
especially separated from Detroit by just a 
few miles and a lifetime’s worth of oppres-
sion, subjugation, ignorance and stark differ-
ence in worldviews. We Arabs and Muslims 
need to stop playing the “we’re all minori-
ties” card and get to work. 
It should not take Black people dying for 
us to care about Black lives — anti-Black rac-
ism is what this country was founded upon 
and has its roots in every corner, every sys-
tem, every institution and structure. And it 
does not start or end with the United States. 
The roots of anti-Blackness in Arab com-
munities can be traced to the Arab Slave 
Trade. Its effects are still prevalent with 
the corrupt system of domestic work in the 
Arab world, akin to modern day slavery. The 
branches can be seen in the lingering and 
ever-present anti-Blackness many of our 
communities harbor, which Susan Abulhawa 
also details in her article, including the idol-
izing of lighter skin and European beauty 
standards. 
Another branch is the colorism which 
exists in our own communities, reverberat-
ing the harmful message that lighter is bet-
ter. Additionally, especially for Arabs and 
Muslims in Dearborn, racism can be seen in 
the interactions between us and Black people 
in our community, the use of Arabic racial 
slurs, the way gas station and store owners 
treat their Black customers, the stark divi-
sion drawn between Dearborn and Detroit 
and the villainization of Black people begin-
ning with the older generation and trickling 
down into ours and the ones below us. It 
can be seen how even Black Arabs and Mus-
lims are treated in our very own communi-
ties. There is a certain superiority complex 
among lighter skin, Levantine Arabs. 
What’s very disheartening is the fact that 
many Arabs and Muslims are able to vehe-
mently denounce Israel and the IDF’s abu-
sive treatment of Palestinians, empathizing 
with and raising awareness for the Pales-
tinian struggle. Yet they fail to realize that 
American police are often trained by the 
IDF, adopting their brutal techniques and 

A Native perspective on 
political resistance and 
force

ANA MARÍA SÁNCHEZ-CASTILLO
MiC Staff Writer

With the tribal erasure of the sovereign 
Native state we saw the beginning of a long 
series of United States law infringing on 
the basic human rights of Black and Native 
Americans. It is fitting that this conversation 
starts from a place of shared resistance. The 
concept of civility must be deconstructed 
and the illusory security of the American 
police force must be illuminated. 
Now and in the upcoming weeks, I intend 
to frame the police state as a continuation 
of Black and Native American genocide and 
enslavement. I hope the intertwining histo-
ries can help to tell a story which weakens 
the foundation of the white institution and 
propels the correct narrative of Black and 
brown lives. 
Don’t talk of the success of civility in the 
same breath as genocide and murder. 
The loss of Black lives is an afterthought 
second to the vehicles of protest, so since 
when was it a priority to take the moral high 
ground? Why is it that the oppressed are 
expected to be passive at the hands of bru-
tality? When history has only given result 
to those who have a greater capacity for vio-
lence than the oppressor.
White institutions continue to run pro-
ductively and efficiently despite nonviolent 
resistance. Institutions such as the police 
force, prisons, and universities work to dis-
mantle Black power out of fear that the white 
grip on enslavement will loosen along with 
the position of white supremacy. These insti-
tutions operate under systems that grew 
from the colonial history of violence, loot-
ing of sacred objects, ransacking of lives 
and the stripping of physical and psycho-
logical dignity. Institutions of the sort must 
be destroyed along with all functions that 
uphold them. As for people shifting the focus 
off of murder and onto the destruction of 
goods, understand these goods are symbols 
of violence and oppression, the capitalism 
which killed and destroyed livelihoods with-
out ramifications. Police stations and luxury 
stores have become mocking symbols of the 
material interest of the white institution, and 
have been protected at the expense of Black 
lives and Black and brown liberation and 
equity, their destruction holds incredible 
political weight. 
Don’t talk about the success of nonvio-
lence. 
It is few and far between the reckless and 
excessive displacement and war on Black and 
brown lives. 
I come from the Lipan Apache tribe of 
Texas. My people died warriors, fighting in 
defense of the land and ideals we grew from. 

My people were murdered, their country 
lazily blundered to build white industries 
stained with Black blood on the bones of the 
Indeginous.
We are alive today because of the revolu-
tions that came before us and because of the 
blood lost fighting for the honor of the land 
pillaged by white colonizers or mass mur-
derers. The fact of the matter is the United 
States was designed for things to operate 
on oppression - the system is working as it 
was intended to, it is not broken, the goal is 
to break it. Issues we see now have endured 
hundreds of years of movements and have 
cost the lives of millions upon thousands. 
This is obvious and those extreme numbers 
must be answered with extreme action. 
As consequences to enduring oppression 
Benjamin Ginsberg explains how, “looters 
deviate from the norms [of white violence] 
because they have reached the limits of their 
endurance and in giving bent to their nor-
mally suppressed rage strike out indiscrimi-
nately”. It is horrific to see a normalization 
of state violence while criminalizing the sup-
pressed anguish of Black and brown commu-
nities, but we must not be deterred. 
The battle takes place on the ground and 
virtually. Linked are organizations accept-
ing donations to release freedom fighters and 
support the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Crowdsourcing is being matched by major 
companies and has the potential to make a 
major impact in continuing the momentum 
towards liberation and a just state. Your dol-
lar holds an influence as does your vote and 
both are integral efforts. Email the Min-
neapolis Police Department and demand 
George Floyds murderers be charged to the 
fullest extent. Sign as many petitions as you 
find productive, such as the Justice for Floyd 
petition. No one is asking for everyone to 
take the stance of getting on the front lines 
protesting, risking bodily harm, but in order 
to avoid scattering the reach of efforts it’s 
important to remain unified in resistance. 
Validate and uphold the efforts of other free-
dom fighters. Fight whether it be physically, 
virtually or both, find a vehicle to join efforts 
and press the gas full speed.
As a culmination of the cries of the war-
riors that came before us, we are a million 
souls on fire, a fire that courses through our 
veins, a fire we must light the streets with - 
hopefully this fire burns the path to justice. 
Some people may just want to watch the 
world burn, some are upset to see their com-
munities destroyed, the bottom line is people 
are angry for one reason or another, and 
tired of explaining why everyone should be.

militaristic nature. They fail to realize our 
struggles are intersecting and how we are 
hypocrites if not standing with our Black 
brothers and sisters in their fight for jus-
tice. The same government we criticize for 
its treatment of us, we must criticize for its 
ongoing and inhumane oppression of Black 
people since the inception of this country. 
The same way we denounce the War on Ter-
ror, we must denounce the War on Drugs and 
recognize its role in destabilizing the Black 
community, beginning a system of criminal-
ization and subjugation.
I attended a Facebook Live event by Mus-
lim nonprofit Wasat, “The Way of Iblis: Rac-
ist Violence and Capitalist Excess” which is 
part of a series called “Breaking the Idols of 
Our Time.” Dr. Bilal Ware began by speak-
ing about God’s love for humanity which is 
proven throughout the Qur’an. He explains 
that in the Qur’an, as well as the Bible, God 
creates through speech.
“He has only to say unto a thing: Be, and it 
is” but “humanity is made with a caress, and 
animated with a kiss, in contradistinction to 
other things that are made with speech” 
He then goes on to discuss the origins of 
racial violence from an Islamic perspective, 
beginning with the fall of Satan for refus-
ing to bow down to Adam due to arrogance 
and feelings of superiority. This arrogance 
was rooted in bodily composition and origin, 
as Satan believed he was superior to Adam 
because he is made of fire, while Adam is 
made of clay. The fact that we as human 
beings, all made of the same fragile and fleet-
ing bodily composition have created a hierar-
chical system that ranks some above others 
and treats them accordingly is evidence of 
sickness of the heart. 
But that sickness, whether we are aware 
of it or not, lives on in fragments of various 
sizes, in our hearts and our communities, 
and it is on each and every single one of us 
to spend our lives eradicating that sickness 
where we see it. This includes but transcends 
intrapersonal and interpersonal racism and 
goes back to the origins — the laws, poli-
cies and corporations which keep it in place 
and how we are contributing to them. The 
resources to learn about these origins and 
how we can do our part are endless and we 
need to be reading and watching relevant 
content, not solely relying on social media to 
educate us with brief stimuli we are likely to 
soon forget. 
The other “Satanic force” Dr. Ware refers 
to its capitalist excess — America’s insatiable 
obsession with greed and wealth.”

Dear , it’s time to address our anti-black racism

JENNY CHONG
MiC Staff Writer

A statement from the 
Black Student Union

“Are you sure you want to go to 
school there? Isn’t it near Detroit, 
which is full of dangerous black 
people?” said my Chinese dad after 
I had gotten accepted to the Uni-
versity of Michigan last spring. 
My dad was not supportive of my 
decision to enroll at the University 
for a few reasons — one of them 
being his perception of Michigan 
as a crime-ridden state overflow-
ing with violence among the black 
community. 
I told him, “Actually, the Univer-
sity isn’t that close to Detroit, and 

the black population at the school is 
less than 5 percent.” 
“Oh, of course there aren’t a lot 
of black people attending. They’re 
too lazy to get in,” he responded. 
Appalled at the words that had 
just come out of my dad’s mouth, I 
expressed my disgust. “That’s rac-
ist. You shouldn’t say that,” I said, 
leaving the conversation at that 
without reading into his anti-black 
racist statements. 
Unaware of it at the time, I had 
enabled my dad to continue believ-
ing his racist behavior was accept-
able by not speaking up. In being 
silent, I was also at fault for subcon-
sciously perpetuating anti-black 

racism. One year later, in the wake 
of the recent violence and brutality 
against members of the Black com-
munity, I am reflecting on the past 
in an attempt to unearth my inter-
nalized anti-blackness and learn 
how to be an Asian-American ally. 
On May 25, George Floyd, who 
was a 46-year-old black man died 
in the custody of four Minneapolis 
police officers, among them, Tou 
Thao, a Hmong-American. In a 
video of Floyd’s arrest, Thao is seen 
looking on as his partner, Derek 
Chauvin, holds his knee to Floyd’s 
neck for nearly nine minutes. 

The Black Student Union at the 
University of Michigan would first 
like to extend wholehearted con-
dolences to the families of recent 
victims of police brutality: Bre-
onna Taylor, George Floyd, David 
McAtee and Tony McDade. How-
ever, our concerns and expressions 
are not limited to these victims as 
there have been countless instanc-
es of police abuse for as long as 
this country has existed. The most 
well-known are those from the past 
decade, where we have witnessed 
many unjust murders of Black folks 
at the hands of police. To name a 
few: Gabriella Nevarez, Mya Hall 
and Atatiana Jefferson. So, the 
questions we should ask ourselves 
are: How is it already 2020 with 
things having not substantially 
changed for the better? Also, how 
can we implement reform such 
that we do not find ourselves hav-
ing this same discussion with our 
children?
Something has to give. It is time 

to bring those in positions of power 
to the table and demand that they 
affect change. This includes gov-
ernment officials who are elected 
to serve their constituents and the 
people in charge of our criminal 
justice systems. We are tired of 
performative acts that create the 
illusion that people care — it is 
time to take this seriously. Actions 
show us more than any amount of 
characters in a letter or words in 
a prayer. We condemn excessive 
police force targeted at those pro-
testing the slaughter of Black bod-
ies and believe they should be given 
the same privileges to peacefully 
protest as those who protested 
stay-at-home orders. Moreover, the 
deployment of military forces by 
President Donald Trump’s Admin-
istration, which is designed to dis-
rupt those protesting the unequal 
treatment of Black folks in the U.S., 
is just another policy intended to 
set back this crucial movement. 
Additionally, we are disgusted by 

the way the media and our nation’s 
leaders have promoted the nar-
rative that protesters are “thugs” 
who only intend to destroy proper-
ty. Most protests around the nation 
have been non-violent displays 
of solidarity amongst oppressed, 
angry 
and 
empowered 
Black 
Americans and their allies. These 
overt displays of opposition to the 
forward progress of our cause are 
evidence of systemic and institu-
tionalized racism and we will not 
tolerate it. 
To make matters worse, Black 
Americans must deal with the 
trauma of police brutality in the 
midst of a global pandemic. The 
irony of the current state of our 
country and world is not lost on us. 
Although the pandemic and police 
brutality may seem unrelated indi-
vidually, the impact that both have 
had on the lives of Black Americans 
is rooted in the same issue: system-
atic inequity and discrimination. 
At this time, we want to extend our 
deepest condolences to our com-
munity members and families who 
are mourning lost lives and suffer-
ing from increased health compli-
cations and associated costs. We 
encourage everyone to stay updat-
ed on the symptoms of COVID-19 
and how it is spread.
No matter how you choose to 
respond to current events, you 
should feel empowered in what-
ever decision you make. Based on 
a history of student activism, we 
are confident that you all will make 
the best decision for yourselves and 
the larger community. The BSU 
will support you regardless of your 
response to current events. 

A Yelp review of 
America

I’ve heard some rumors about 
this place. Apparently, the owners 
don’t even own the land on which 
this restaurant sits. The service 
here is terrible. The ambiance is 
lackluster. Let me correct myself: 
the atmosphere is hostile. Don’t get 
me started on the food. Their week-
ly special of cultural appropriation 
comes with two sides: fearing peo-
ple of color and the denial of white 
privilege. 
Sometimes, 
if 
we’re 
lucky — and it’s in season — they’ll 
add racial profiling onto the menu 
and a free dessert. Imagine hav-
ing reverse racism a la mode with a 
brownie. Yummy right? This place 
has been here for what feels like 
centuries. Some people dragged my 
ancestors here because they just 
had to try it. I didn’t like the taste. I 
wanted to send it back. First, I tried 
speaking to other patrons. Maybe 
they would see something wrong 
with this restaurant. They said the 
food tasted great! Most of them are 
regulars and thought I was outra-
geous for my negative review. I 
tried speaking to the managers. 
They ignored me. They didn’t both-
er to hear or see me. If I ever decide 
to go to this restaurant again, it’ll 
be a curbside pickup. Oh, and no 
tip. All in all, I’d give it no stars.
There are so many names to say. 
George Floyd, Eric Garner, Michael 
Brown, 
Freddie 
Grey, 
Sandra 
Bland, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Mar-
tin, or Philando Castile to name a 
few. Another year, another month, 
another day and another unarmed 
Black man and woman killed. To

wake up every day, seeing these 
names, seeing graphic videos of 
their death, is traumatizing. When 
we urge others to say their name, it 
is because they can no longer say it 
for themselves and because some-
one decided that their life had no 
value. Graphic videos, however, 
create an unimaginable amount 
of pain and perpetuate inherent 
trauma. How many more names 
are we going to have to say and 
scream until someone can finally 
see that this place is not safe? How 
many more brothers, husbands, 
fathers, mothers, daughters and 
granddaughters have to die? How 
many of our children across the 
diaspora need to grow up and have 
“the talk.” Not the birds and bees, 
but the “Here’s what you do when 
you interact with the police, are 
profiled or when someone deter-
mines your skin color is a threat.” 
That makes the birds and the 
bees easy in comparison. How do 
you tell your teenage Black son, 
“Don’t wear that hoodie, wear 
bright colors when you go out with 
your friends and don’t move your 
hands off the wheel when you’re 
stopped?” Or your Black daughter, 
“Limit your passion because they 
will perceive you as angry. Remem-
ber to work twice as hard, because 
you will only be given half.” What 
does that say about America?
What does the silence from oth-
ers say? The silence from others 
tells me that they do not value my 
life or the lives of others who look 
like me.

Red Berenson appointed special adviser to Big Ten commissioner

When new Big Ten commissioner 
Kevin Warren visited Yost Ice Arena 
in February, he was on a mission.
Warren set a goal to see every 
team at every Big Ten institution 
play at least once in the first year 
of his tenure, so watching the 
Michigan hockey team take on 
Wisconsin on Feb. 7 was just a step 
along that path. But Warren had 
a second goal that day: Get former 
Michigan coach Red Berenson to 
join his staff as a special adviser for 
hockey operations.
At 80 years old, three seasons 
removed from his retirement after 
33 years behind the bench for the 
Wolverines, 
Berenson 
attends 
nearly every home game and can 
be found holding court from the 
first box on the right. That night, 
Warren joined him.
“He made it a point to corner 
me and we sat down and talked,” 
Berenson told The Daily. “He said 
he really felt strongly about Big Ten 
hockey and hockey in general. … 
He said he just loves hockey and he 
wants to see the Big Ten conference 
get better and he wants me to be his 
special adviser and work with him 

in trying to make the conference 
better.”
A 
few 
weeks 
after 
their 
conversation at Yost, Berenson 
signed on and began his role as 
Warren’s special adviser on hockey, 
as first reported by Todd Milewski 
of the Wisconsin State Journal. 
Two weeks later, the remainder 
of the college athletics season 
was canceled. There have been no 
decisions made about next season, 
which changes things for Berenson.
It’s a rule-change year for 
college hockey, which only adopts 
rule changes every other year, so 
ordinarily, this summer would 
be 
filled 
with 
meetings 
and 
conferences among Big Ten coaches 
and coaches across the country 
— exactly the kind of meeting 
Berenson would attend. Now, those 
meetings have become conference 
calls, but discussions haven’t slowed 
down in the slightest.
“Everyone’s 
working 
from 
home, but it’s amazing how they’re 
still inspired and invested in the 
upcoming season,” Berenson said. 
“Whatever the conversations have 
been about rules or overtime or 
whatever it’s been, the coaches are 
all over it. It’s been really good.”
Berenson’s 
role 
currently 

involves being on just about every 
conference call that happens in 
college hockey — whether it’s 
with Big Ten coaches, coaches 
across the league, other Big Ten 
administrators or commissioners of 
other leagues that sponsor hockey. 
Once a week, he has a call with 
Warren to stay up to date on the rest 
of the Big Ten and update Warren 
on what’s happening on the hockey 
side of things.
And despite taking on this new 
role, Berenson is continuing to 
work for the Michigan athletic 
department as an adviser to athletic 
director Warde Manuel — though 
he’s technically retired.
“I enjoy it,” Berenson said. “I 
really do. I can’t say that I miss 
coaching. I don’t miss coaching, 
but I enjoy the games, I enjoy the 
environment. I love going to Yost. 
I know all the coaches around 
the league, and they’ve been very 
receptive to my coming on board.”
Since 
the 
Big 
Ten 
began 
sponsoring hockey in 2013, there 
have been a myriad of criticisms 
of how the league has handled 
the sport. Everything from TV 
presence to team performance has 
come under fire, and Berenson is 
taking on the task of dealing with 

those concerns.
“My goals are whatever’s best 
for the conference, but I’d like to 
help it grow in the right direction,” 
Berenson said. “You’d like to see 
the teams do well. You’d like to see 
the chance of expansion. I would 
be a big promoter of expansion, 
particularly within the Big Ten. For 
example, there were rumors Illinois 
might be interested in adding 
hockey, and then this virus hit. … 
I’ll stay close to Steve Piotrowski, 
who’s the head of officials, and in 
terms of officiating and just making 
the conference better.
“…I want to improve the game and 
then improve the communication 
with the teams and the coaches. If 
there are things we need to address 
as a conference, they can work 
through me. Kevin and I have a 
good line of communication, so I 
think that’ll help where you’re not 
dealing with non-hockey people.”
With 
Warren 
as 
the 
commissioner, 
the 
Big 
Ten 
intends to put a greater focus on 
hockey — a contrast to how things 
where handled under previous 
commissioner Jim Delany, who 
focused primarily on football and 
basketball.
“The thing that really inspires 

me is Kevin’s passion for hockey,” 
Berenson said. “It’s not like he 
doesn’t 
know 
anything 
about 
hockey. He knows a lot about 
hockey, and he cares about hockey. 
I don’t know that we’ve had that 
passion, necessarily, coming out 
of the Big Ten office for hockey. 
It’s been a conference maybe 
driven strictly by football or some 
basketball, but it sounds now that 
he wants hockey to get better.”

After playing every minute last season, Marc Ybarra has more in the tank

The final whistle blew against 
Wake Forest in the Sweet Sixteen, 
ending a long race for the Michigan 
men’s soccer team. The 3-1 loss 
capped off a full season of playing 
time for then-junior midfielder Marc 
Ybarra, who quickly pivoted towards 

the next race for a national and 
Big Ten title — a mountaintop he’s 
strived to reach since claiming it his 
freshman year. 
Ybarra started in midfield for all 
of the Wolverines’ 22 matches and 
never left the field, the only Michigan 
player to do so — a testament 
to his consistency. This statistic 
encompasses 
Ybarra’s 
character: 

A workhorse midfielder, a devoted 
teammate and a player who is always 
looking to improve, no matter how 
many miles are on his cleats. 
Growing up as a hometown kid in 
Ann Arbor, Ybarra — the youngest 
of four siblings — drew inspiration 
from his older siblings on the soccer 
field.
“I look up to my brother, Matt 
Ybarra, who played at Detroit Mercy 
from 2011-2014,” Ybarra said. “We 
both play similar positions and he 
was a captain. He played all the time, 
and I looked up to his work ethic.”
Marc credited the growth of his 
game to not just Matt, but all three of 
his siblings. 
“It extends even more than my 
brother. I’m the youngest in my 
family, and all three of my siblings 
played soccer growing up,” Ybarra 
said. “I had those mentors, and the 
support of older people than myself.”
“I’m always supporting attackers 
and 
supporting 
defenders. 
For 
me, consistency is always being 
there. Showing up and being there 

everyday.”
There are two factors that allowed 
Ybarra to stay on the pitch all 
season: good health and trust from 
the coaching staff. Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley could always count on 
Ybarra to be healthy and impact the 
starting 11.
Ybarra’s consistency doesn’t end 
after the final whistle is blown. Even 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Ybarra 
is 
helping 
his 
fellow 
midfielders, defenders, attackers and 
future teammates. 
“This team is the first time I have 
had to embrace that role. Now going 
into my senior year, I’m reaching 
out to incoming freshmen,” Ybarra 
said. “It’s been a different role, but 
it’s good to be confident that when I 
leave after next year, the other guys 
that I am having conversations with 
will fill the same role I had.”
The stay-at-home orders have 
struck uncertainty in how Michigan 
will prepare for the upcoming season. 
Even without spring matches and 
in-person practices, Ybarra and the 

rest of the upperclassmen stayed true 
to their leadership. Communication 
plays a key part in Ybarra’s game, 
both on and off the field — Ybarra 
is a U-M Leadership, Excellence, 
Achievement, and Diversity (LEAD) 
Scholar. In order for the team to 
develop as much as possible at a 
distance from one another, Ybarra’s 
mentorship to the underclassmen 
and new recruits is essential for 
success next season. 
“We have had a couple calls with 
the whole team,” Ybarra said.“I 
think the older guys have taken it 
upon themselves to reach out to a 
couple specified players, especially 
the incoming guys. We’ve been 
reassuring that they can reach out 
with anything they need. More of 
delegating between a couple guys 
each making sure we’re all in touch 
and ready to go in the fall, hopefully.”
After 
playing 
nearly 
2,000 
minutes in 2019, Ybarra’s mind does 
not want to keep count. He is solely 
focused on the most important team 
goal: winning.

Amidst crisis, ‘M’ adjusts its recruiting

As the Michigan football team 
adjusted to a new norm in early 
March, coach Jim Harbaugh and 
director of recruiting Matt Dudek 
found themselves working on a new 
playbook.
With the Wolverines’ spring 
practice slate wiped out due to the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
Harbaugh 
and Dudek turned their attention 
toward preventing Michigan from 
missing a beat on the recruiting trail. 
According to running backs coach 
and special teams coordinator Jay 
Harbaugh, that gameplan boiled 
down to four questions:
How long will this last? How is it 
going to impact recruiting? How are 
we going to separate ourselves, be 
different and do a great job? What’s 
the day-to-day plan?
So far, the playbook is paying 
dividends. Michigan has secured 
commitments from a trio of four-
star prospects — linebackers Junior 

Colson and Jaydon Hood and 
defensive lineman Kechaun Bennett 
— in the last week alone, propelling 
its 2021 recruiting class to a No. 5 
national ranking, per 247Sports.
“All of it goes back to the 
beginning of this whole deal,” Jay 
said in a teleconference Friday. “It all 
started with that and (Harbaugh and 
Dudek) presented an awesome vision 
and we all bought into it and really 
stuck to it day in and day out. All 
these coaches do such an awesome 
job connecting with players, with 
high school coaches, finding ways to 
keep things interesting.
“I think as time goes on, some of 
these players, they’re getting a little 
bit bored of being recruited the same 
way. They can’t go on campus (and) 
there are certain things they’re just 
not able to do, so the staffs that have 
been able to keep things engaging 
are feeling the benefits there.”
Even without a chance to host 
prospects in person, the Wolverines 
continue to round out their 2021 
recruiting 
class. 
Michigan 
has 
received 14 pledges during the 

NCAA’s 
extended 
dead 
period, 
surpassing other Big Ten programs 
Penn State, Minnesota and Iowa in 
the national team rankings.
The pandemic has challenged the 
Wolverines, like every other team, 
to think outside the box. And in a 
time like this, the more creative a 
program is, the more successful its 
recruiting is. 
“You’re finding all creative ways 
(to recruit),” offensive coordinator 
Josh Gattis said in a teleconference 
on May 14. “Whether it’s virtual 
visits, whether it’s virtual meetings, 
FaceTimes, you’ve got to be as 
creative as possible to be able to 
showcase 
your 
university 
and 
program in these times when they 
currently can’t come visit.”
Added Jay: “(Recruits) are able 
to do the virtual tours, they’re able 
to see things on Google Maps and 
streetview. They’re able to reach 
out to players and talk about things, 
‘Hey, what’s it like day to day?’ … You 
have to gather all the information 
you can, talk to all the people you 
need to from each school — the 

players, the staffs — you go on the 
virtual tour, you do virtual visits and 
all that stuff and you make the best 
decision you can.”
With visits currently paused 
through the end of July, Michigan 
stands to benefit from previously 
hosting a handful of top targets. But 
for the prospects yet to step foot on 
campus, especially those who would 
need a long-distance trip to make 
it to Ann Arbor, the pandemic has 

created additional obstacles.
In those cases, the Wolverines’ 
staff has leaned on its new recruiting 
playbook. And with recruiting still in 
a state of flux, Michigan’s answers to 
those four questions have made all 
the difference.
“These recruits, they’re going 
through this whole thing (and) like 
everyone else, they’re having to 
adapt,” Jay said. “I think that’s kind 
of the way recruiting is right now.”

Freshman Corum adds to loaded running backs room

In 
his 
first 
semester 
at 
Michigan, Blake Corum had a 4.0 
GPA and ran a high 4.4 40-yard 
dash in the Wolverines’ spring 
tests.
With 
stats 
like 
that, 
it’s 
no surprise the hype is only 
building 
for 
the 
four-star 
freshman running back. Corum 
joins Michigan’s most crowded 
running backs room in years 
— and though the Wolverines 
return four backs with significant 
playing experience, it’s clear the 
coaches also prioritize getting 
Corum on the field.
“Blake 
Corum 
is 
as 
fast 
as 
advertised,” 
offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis said in 
a teleconference May 14. “… Just 
an exciting kid, just a tough, 
physical kid. I’ve known Blake 
since his ninth-grade year in high 
school. Just excited about that 
kid and his maturity, leadership 
he already brings. He brings a 
toughness, mentality. He’s got 
a great skillset, he’s a physical 
runner. People look at him as an 

undersized guy because of his 
height, but the heart, the strength 
and the speed that he brings, he 
packs a punch. So we’re really 
excited about him from that 
standpoint.”
As an early enrollee, Corum 
was one of the players hurt most 
by the lack of spring practice, 
robbing him of a chance to grow 
acclimated to the competitiveness 
of college football. If he hopes to 
see the field in 2020, he’ll have to 

do so without the extra semester 
of training he thought he’d gotten.
That’s not to say it can’t be done. 
Sophomore 
Zach 
Charbonnet 
missed all of spring ball in 2019 
with an injury and still took hold 
of Michigan’s starting job in the 
fall, and though this is a different 
situation, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
coaches are confident. Running 
backs 
coach 
Jay 
Harbaugh 
described Corum as someone 
who went all-out at everything. 

Despite only being able to meet 
with the rest of the team over 
Zoom, Corum has made the best 
of the situation without making 
excuses, and that hasn’t gone 
unnoticed. And though he didn’t 
get to participate in spring ball, 
Corum did get a taste of campus 
life and participated in winter 
workouts with the team before 
the COVID-19 shutdown.
“(Corum) did practice with 
us, so he’s done it a little bit at 
least and even though he missed 
spring, he’s a guy who will walk 
through things on his own,” 
Harbaugh said in a teleconference 
Friday. “He played against great 
competition in high school, so I 
would expect him to transition 
well in terms of the speed of the 
game and everything”
When 
Michigan 
takes 
the 
field again, Gattis sees in Corum 
a skillset that will allow him to 
play all over the field, taking 
handoffs, running routes out of 
the backfield and making plays in 
space. His strengths are similar 
to those of fifth-year senior Chris 
Evans, giving Corum another 
running back to learn from once 
he comes back.

Corum still faces an uphill 
battle for significant playing time, 
both because of the pandemic 
and because the Wolverines’ 
top 
two 
running 
backs 
last 
year — Charbonnet and Hassan 
Haskins — still have three years 
of eligibility left (though Haskins 
will be draft eligible next year 
and Charbonnet in 2022). But if 
the coaches are to be believed, 
Corum will make the most of his 
stiff competition.
“Blake is awesome, you know,” 
Harbaugh said. “ … He just goes 
hard at every single thing he’s 
presented with. I think he got a 
4.0 or close to it his first semester. 
He’s on time for everything 
virtually, he turns everything 
in, he takes tremendous notes, 
he asks questions, he’s just a 
junkie for football, but also for 
everything. He’s very binary. It’s 
like, all in or he’s not into it. So 
I think that that will serve him 
really good in terms of getting 
through this without it being a 
setback for him.”
There’s no way to know how 
Corum will look when he steps 
onto the field for the first time. 
But the coaches believe he can 
force their hands into playing 
time right away, even at a crowded 
position. For Michigan, it’s a good 
problem to have.
