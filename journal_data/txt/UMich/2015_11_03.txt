ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Discussion points 
to special interests 
as detriment to the 

collective good

By DANIEL OH

For the Daily

Hundreds 
filled 
Rackham 

Auditorium on Monday to hear 

Naomi Klein, a noted Canadian 
author 
and 
social 
activist, 

discuss her new book, “This 
Changes Everything: Capitalism 
vs. The Climate.”

The 
book 
discusses 
the 

detrimental path political and 
economic systems have carved 
for the environment and society 
as a whole.

“The theme of this series 

is conversion … conversion of 
the climate, conversion of the 

economy,” Klein said. “And that 
is at the heart of the work that I 
do for climate change. Climate 
change changes everything.”

Climate change and social 

policy often clash when natural 
disasters occur, Klein said. She 
shared the example of Hurricane 
Katrina, which devastated New 
Orleans in 2005. The storm shut 
down Charity Hospital, which 
Klein explained was “one of the 
only places where poor African 

Americans could get health care 
in the city.”

She noted that the hospital is 

still closed today as a result of 
negligent policies that prioritize 
minimizing costs over catering 
to constituents.

“(This) is one more example 

of taking advantage of a crisis 
that was born out of a collision 
between heavy weather and 
a deep neglect of the public

University details 
impact of Prop 2 on 
minority enrollment

No stranger to court cases 

regarding the constitutionality 
of 
affirmative 
action, 
the 

University 
submitted 
an 

amicus 
brief 
to 
the 
U.S. 

Supreme Court on Monday 
highlighting its opinion that 
such programs are invaluable 
to colleges that strive to 
increase diversity on their 
campuses.

An 
amicus 
brief 
is 
a 

document in which a third 
party 
sends 
its 
opinions 

and additional information 
on a particular case for the 
court’s 
consideration. 
The 

University is the subject of 
two historic Supreme Court 
cases surrounding affirmative 

action, and the University of 
Texas is the defendant in the 
current case before the court, 
Fisher v. University of Texas 
at Austin.

In its brief, the University 

argues that the pursuit of 
diversity is a legitimate goal for 
universities, writing further 
that it supports the University 
of Texas in its endeavor to do 
so by operating race-based 
admissions programs.

“That view accords with 

the overwhelming consensus 
of 
American 
universities, 

which have concluded that 
racial diversity benefits the 
exchange and development of 
ideas by increasing students’ 
variety 
of 
perspectives; 

promotes 
cross-racial 

understanding 
and 
dispels 

racial stereotypes; and helps 
prepare students to be leaders 
in a global marketplace and 
increasingly 
multicultural 

society,” the brief said.

ADMINISTRATION

Faculty, students will 
form committee to 
consider release of 
teaching evaluations

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs spent part of their 
Monday 
session 
discussing 

the 
most 
recent 
Faculty 

Senate meeting during which 
a majority of the 125 faculty 
members in attendance voted to 
support delaying the release of 
course evaluation data.

At a SACUA meeting last 

month, Engineering Prof. James 
Holloway, the vice provost of 
global and engaged education, 
announced the University might 
release course evaluation data as 
soon as the end of this semester. 
Holloway’s announcement was 
met with surprise by SACUA 
members, who said they were 
not consulted about such a 
release.

SACUA 
Chair 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, 
a 
professor 
of 

Comparative Literature, said 
Monday that she was pleased 
with 
the 
Faculty 
Senate 

meeting’s turnout.

“I think a lot of it was personal 

outreach and people talking to 
their friends,” she said. “And I 
think it was a really successful 
meeting; I’ve received a lot of 
positive comments from people 
saying they were impressed 
with the turnout, the substance 

of the discussion, so I think that 
was good.”

During last week’s Faculty 

Senate meeting, Central Student 
Government President Cooper 
Charlton, an LSA senior, said 
he was still in favor of releasing 
course evaluation data in time 
for the winter 2016 semester.

“We want this to be a 

collaborative effort,” Charlton 
said. “By no means are we here 
to shove your concerns into a 
corner and not listen to you. That 
being said, it’s a decision, ‘are 
we going to release these now 
or are we going to kick the can 
down the road?’ We see there’s 
two conversations going on: the 
immediate release of course 
evaluations as they stand, and 
the second conversation is, how 
can we come together, through 
the committee Dr. Holloway has 
suggested, to determine what 
the instrument looks like going 
forward?”

Weineck said she met with 

Charlton 
after 
the 
Faculty 

Senate vote to discuss how 
students and faculty could work 
together on the issue moving 
forward.

During 
their 
meeting, 

Weineck said she and Charlton 
agreed to form a committee, 
comprised 
of 
three 
faculty 

members and three students, 
to determine protocols for the 
eventual release of the course 
evaluation data. Weineck said 
she anticipates the committee’s 
work wrapping up by April 2016.

Genetic depository 
informs advances 
in treating mental 

health issues

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

When 
Heinz 
Prechter, 

founder 
of 
the 
American 

Sunroof Company, died in 2001 
at age 59, his widow created a 
fund to advance research on 
mental illness he struggled with: 
bipolar disorder.

The 
Heinz 
C. 
Prechter 

Bipolar Research Fund started 
in 2001 and became associated 
with the University’s Depression 
Center in 2004. The fund 
engages in research on bipolar 
disorder, specifically through 

the Prechter Bipolar Genetics 
Repository, the largest privately-
funded bank of patient samples 
of its kind.

On Monday, the ninth annual 

Prechter Lecture explored the 
potential of genetics to inform 
research on bipolar disorder. 
Keynote speaker Leroy Hood, 
president and co-founder of the 
Institute for Systems Biology, a 
nonprofit biomedical research 
organization based in Seattle, 
covered the ways in which 
researchers can address disease 
based on genetic information.

“Genetics do not determine 

your destiny; they determine 
your potential,” he said.

Leroy said he was a strong 

advocate for “P4 medicine,” 
which 
applies 
to 
treatment 

that is predictive, preventive, 
personalized and participatory. 
He said this approach helps 

result in the earliest and best 
treatments possible.

He said research has found 

people can combat their genetic 
dispositions through wellness, 
with practices such as eating 
well and exercising regularly.

Hood 
also 
said 
family 

genomics, or the study of genetic 
sequences 
within 
a 
family, 

have 
produced 
interesting 

correlations between bipolar 
disorder and certain genetic 
triggers.

“We can stratify patients in so 

many new and powerful ways,” 
he said. “Stratification is really 
the key to complex diseases. We 
can bring wellness to those who 
are at risk to bipolar disease and 
those who have other genetic 
predispositions.”

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Fire 

Department responded to a 
fire Monday afternoon near a 
vacant building behind Sava’s 
Restaurant on State Street.

The building, located at 212 

S. State St., was unoccupied 
and according to firefighters 
at the scene, only trash 
surrounding 
the 
building 

actually burned. It’s currently 
unclear how the fire started.

Firefighters at the scene 

also said the building looks 
exactly as it did before the fire, 
but since the vacant building 
was already deemed unsafe 
for entry, firefighters did not 
enter the building to assess 
potential damage further.

The city previously issued 

a blight enforcement warning 
to 
the 
building’s 
owner, 

Bloomfield Hills developer 
Howard Frehsee, according 
to a September report in The 
Ann Arbor News. The city had 
determined the building was 
dangerous and sent its owner 
a notice ordering demolition 
of the structure. He had until 
Sept. 9 to comply.

The fire was fully extin-

guished by 3:40 p.m.

determine whether the current 
course evaluation instrument 
is in line with best practices. If 
it is not, the committee will be

According 
to 
Weineck, 

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack wants the issue of how 
and when to release course 
evaluation data to be decided 
by faculty and students.

“(Pollack) 
seemed

Alzheimer’s research links gene 
groups to disease progression

At Bernard W. 

Agranoff Lecture, 

lecture shows 

promise for a cure

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Alzheimer’s 
has 
historically 

been a disease researchers have 
struggled to find an effective 
treatment or cure for — however, 
Stanford University Prof. Carla 
Shatz hopes to change that.

Shatz’s work at the forefront of 

Alzheimer’s research was featured 
Monday during the Bernard W. 
Agranoff Lecture, an annual talk 
honoring the neuroscience pioneer 
who retired from his teaching 
position at the University in 2003.

Shatz was the first woman 

to earn tenure in the basic 
sciences at Stanford, where she 
is currently a professor of biology 
and neurobiology. Her research 

focuses on synaptic plasticity, or 
the ability of the gaps between 
nerve cells to strengthen or 
weaken over time, in relation to 
Alzheimer’s disease.

Throughout her lecture, Shatz 

emphasized the importance of 
a type of gene — MHC class I — 
specifically the MHC gene PirB. 
Her research teams throughout 
the years have focused on studying 
the visual cortex in the brain to 
uncover whether that particular 
gene is involved in regulating 
synaptic plasticity.

The MHC family of genes is 

complex and because the team 
pinpointed the family as important 
in diseases like Alzheimer’s, there 
may be more need to focus on their 
specific functions.

Shatz focused heavily on what 

she 
called 
“critical 
periods,” 

during which learning occurs, 
in the mice she studied. She said 
the genes that enable this type of 
learning remain present in elderly 
people or those with Alzheimer’s, 
but are repressed.

Shatz also said her team found 

that the PirB gene inhibits the 
ability of synapses to strengthen 
and weaken over time in response 
to increases or decreases in 
their activity. This may in turn 
contribute to Alzheimer’s disease.

“PirB downstream signaling 

opposes cascades that are required 
for synaptic plasticity,” she said. 
“Especially, more interesting a 
question for me as I get older is: Is 
this enough? We know that there’s 
a co-regulation between synaptic 
weakening and synaptic pruning 
and the PirB loss of function.”

The goal, Shatz said, is to find 

a way to inhibit PirB in humans, 
which contributes the loss of 
synapses in a process called 
“pruning.” 

“One of the ways we investigated 

this question was simply to take an 
Alzheimer mouse model and cross 
it with germline PirB knocked out 
mice and to ask whether in the 
absence of the PirB receptor, these 
mice might be protected from 
memory loss,” she said.

Employing basic memory tests, 

Shatz’s team found that when PirB 
receptors were blocked in mice 
that modeled Alzheimer’s, they 
performed on par with normal 
mice.

“What we discovered was in 

the absence of the PirB receptor 
they were performing memory 
discrimination at the same level as 
model-type mice,” she said.

Shatz ended her lecture on 

a hopeful note, saying the need 
for a pill to block PirB function 
could be on the forefront of her 
research. Though she said that 
kind of development takes time, 
the advances so far are promising.

Neuroscience 
post-

baccalaureate 
student 
Sharena 

Rice said she learned a lot from 
Shatz’s lecture and was especially 
fascinated by the way in which she 
conducted her research by using 
the visual cortex as a method of 
discovering PirB functions.

“This opened my eyes to visual 

neuroplasticity,” Rice said. “It 
brings up more questions and we 
need questions to identify more 
answers.”

App combines social platforms

Whether puppies on the 

Diag, an a cappella concert or 
the view from a new favorite 
study spot, it can be difficult to 
include everything in a mass 
e-mail or a single Yik Yak post.

The new app Speakiesy 

aims to combine the benefits 
of Twitter, Instagram and Yik 
Yak into one social media plat-
form to inform students what is 
occurring on campus. 

LSA sophomore Nia Ulfers 

is the campus representative 
for the app and said she has 
gained invaluable marketing 
experience through the experi-
ence.

What exactly is Speakiesy?

Well, the best way to 

describe the app is a social 
media site almost like Twit-
ter, Yik Yak and Instagram all 
rolled into one, but with the 
exclusivity of being purely for 
University of Michigan stu-
dents, so you have a to use a 
University of Michigan e-mail 
to be able to sign up for the 
app.

What is the purpose of 

Speakiesy?

The purpose of the app 

is to let people know what 
is going on around cam-
pus. You could also use it 
for purely fun purposes as 
well: like posting a picture 
of you and your dog or how 
nice the Diag looks on a 

certain day.

Why did you want to 

become a representative 

for Speakiesy?

I’m looking to get into mar-

keting and advertising. There 
is no major (for that) here so 
I’m currently pursuing an 
Organizational Studies major, 
but I think that through this 
experience I will learn valu-
able real life skills: I get to 
experience building some-
thing from the ground up, and 
how difficult it is to spread 
word on a huge campus like 
this, let alone a bigger city or 
bigger publication.

it 
is 
not 
uncommon 
for 

institutions with expertise on 
a certain issue to submit briefs 
to the Supreme Court. He said 
in this particular case, the 
University can draw on its own 
experience to help the court 
make a sensible decision.

In 2006, Michigan voters 

approved an amendment to 
the state’s constitution, called 
Proposal 
2, 
which 
banned 

colleges and universities from 
granting preferential treatment 
to any student based on race, 
ethnicity, sex or national origin. 
Accordingly, 
the 
University 

abandoned 
race-based 

affirmative action, and attempts 
to achieve racial diversity on its 
campus through a race-neutral 
admissions process.

Regardless, in the brief, the 

University said it continues 
to 
believe 
the 
limited 

consideration 
of 
race 
is 

necessary to attain institutional 
diversity.

“To 
identify 
promising 

candidates 
effectively, 

admissions officers must be 
able to consider the fullness of 
each applicant’s background 

and 
experience, 
including 

socioeconomic 
profile, 

challenges overcome, cultural 
background — and also the 
applicant’s race,” the brief said.

In the case of Fisher v. 

University of Texas at Austin, 
a student named Abigail Fisher, 
who is white, is arguing that 
she would have been admitted 
to the UT Austin if not for her 
race. Currently, the University 
of Texas employs two parallel 
admissions systems: one is an 
automatic admissions program 
for 
in-state 
students 
who 

graduate in the top 10 percent 
of their classes — known as the 
10 percent plan — and the other 
is a holistic process used to 
evaluate out-of-state students 
as well as Texans who did not 
graduate at the top of their 
classes. The court originally 
heard the Fisher case in 2013, 
but sent it back to a lower 
court at the time for further 
review. The court will hear the 
case again in oral arguments 
scheduled for December. 

In 
the 
Fisher 
case, 
the 

court will decide the future 
of the consideration of race in 
admissions procedures — if 
it rules in favor of Fisher, all 
universities, including Texas, 
would be required to remove 

any consideration of race from 
their admissions programs.

As the result of previous 

affirmative 
action 
cases, 

universities may not use quota 
or point systems to achieve 
racial 
diversity, 
but 
may 

qualitatively 
consider 
race 

as one of many factors when 
making admissions decisions. 
In 2003, the court upheld 
the University of Michigan’s 
holistic 
affirmative 
action 

admissions policies practicied 
in the Law School, but in 
another case that same year, 
struck down the University’s 
undergraduate 
policy 
which 

employed a point system.

The outcome of the Fisher 

case could be determined by the 
potential swing vote of Justice 
Anthony 
Kennedy. 
He 
has 

tended to side with the more 
conservative justices against 
affirmative action in the past, if 
that is any indication of how the 
case could unfold.

Along these lines, Primus 

said the University’s brief is 
important as an example of 
an institution that currently 
operates how the University 
of Texas would be required to 
if the court ruled in favor of 
Fisher.

“One of the big questions for 

Justice Kennedy, and therefore 
for 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
— 

because Justice Kennedy is the 
median justice on this issue — is 
the extent to which universities 
can be racially diverse without 
race-based affirmative action,” 
he said. “We are a good 
example of a university that 
is trying hard to be racially 
diverse without (race-based) 
affirmative action.”

In 
support 
of 
the 
UT 

position, the University held 
in the brief that since race-
conscious admission programs 
were banned in Michigan, the 
University has had trouble 
meeting its goals for diversity 
on its campuses.

“Despite 
persistent 
and 

varied 
efforts 
to 
increase 

student-body racial and ethnic 
diversity 
by 
race-neutral 

means; 
despite 
committed 

efforts by University faculty, 
staff, students, and alumni 
to 
conduct 
race-neutral 

recruiting 
and 
admissions 

programs; 
and 
despite 

admissions 
consideration 

and 
extensive 
financial 

aid 
for 
socioeconomically 

disadvantaged 
students, 

admission 
and 
enrollment 

of 
underrepresented 

minority students have fallen 

precipitously in many of U-M’s 
schools 
and 
colleges 
since 

Proposal 2 was enacted,” the 
brief said.

To 
this 
end, 
the 
brief 

cited 
two 
Michigan 
Daily 

articles concerning minority 
enrollment at the University.

While the ruling in Fisher 

will not legally affect the 
University (as it is already 
banned from employing race 
considerations in admissions 
decisions 
based 
on 
state 

law), 
it 
could 
have 
broad 

policy implications for other 
universities 
and 
colleges 

nationwide.

Primus 
said 
other 

institutions 
currently 

employ the kinds of race-
based 
admissions 
processes 

the 
University 
previously 

employed.

“Nationwide, the Supreme 

Court has left the door open for 
certain kinds of consideration 
of race in admissions, so long 
as the system of admissions 
overall is careful to treat each 
applicant 
as 
an 
individual 

instead of as a manifestation of 
a racial category,” he said. “One 
of the questions is whether 
other states can continue to use 
the method that we used to use 
successfully here.”

Student the subject 
of armed robbery 
on Halloween

This 
Halloween, 
at 

approximately 
8:20 
p.m., 
a 

student was robbed by an armed, 
unknown male at the 1100 block of 
Oakland Street at East University 
Avenue.

The student’s cell phone was 

taken and the suspect fled on foot.

The suspect was described to 

Ann Arbor Police by the witness 
as being a Black male in his early 
20s, of medium build, wearing a 
backwards black hat.

Diane Brown, University Police 

spokeswoman, said AAPD has no 
further 
information 
regarding 

this incident at this time.

Students were notified of the 

armed robbery Nov. 2 at 12:49 
p.m., three days after it took place 
on Oct. 31.

On Oct. 19, students were 

notified of a home invasion at the 
700 block of Oakland Street. This 
suspect involved in this incident 
had a similar description — a 
Black male in his 20s of medium 
build wearing a backwards denim 
baseball hat.

Supreme Court 
rejects hearing 
Armstrong case

The U.S. Supreme Court on 

Monday said it won’t hear an 
appeal from the former Michigan 
assistant attorney general who 
lost a defamation suit filed by a 
former University student body 
president.

Chris Armstrong was the first 

openly gay Michigan Student 
Assembly (now Central Student 
Government) president. Shirvell, 
former state attorney general, was 
fired in 2010 for anti-gay rhetoric 
against Armstrong, which then 
attorney 
general 
Mike 
Cox 

deemed “harassing conduct.”

In February, a circuit court 

upheld 
the 
defamation 
suit, 

though it reduced the damages 
Shirvell owed to $3.5 million.

Armstrong alleged that Shirvell 

stalked and harassed him because 
of his sexuality. Shirvell was 
ultimately fired from his position 
after creating a blog titled “Chris 
Armstrong Watch” where he 
argued Armstrong was using 
his position as MSA president to 
promote a “radical homosexual 
agenda.”

Alum John Wu 
donates $10M to 
China partnership

John Wu and his wife Jane Sun 

donated $10 million to the Univer-
sity of Michigan’s Shanghai Jiao-
tong University Joint Institute; 
the University’s largest global 
partnership.

The donation will go toward 

the creation of the John Wu and 
Jane Sun Endowment Fund to 
fund scholarships, professors, fac-
ulty awards and student entrepre-
neurship funds.

Though the China-based insti-

tute is the largest global partner-
ship the University is involved in, 
the University sponsors initiatives

University to aid in 
regional data hub

The National Science Founda-

tion is working to create a national 
data hub, and the University was 
chosen as one of five universities 
to take charge of the Midwest 
Big Data Innovation Hub. Other 
universities involved are Illinois, 
Indiana, North Dakota and Iowa 
State.

The Midwestern hub is one of 

four regional data hubs created 
across the United States.

By creating the date hubs, the 

NSF hopes to create partnerships 
to utilize the data to fix regional 
problems. The city of Detroit, Gen-
eral Motors, TechTown Detroit, 
the Henry Ford Health System, 
Domino’s Pizza, Ford Motor Com-
pany and Quicken Loans are all 
partners on the project.

The Midwest hub will focus on 

societal infrastructure, nature 
and health care.

sphere,” Klein said. “This is how 
our current system deals with 
climate change.”

With 
weak 
support 
for 

constructive 
public 
policy 

in times of natural disasters, 
Klein argued, there is a great 
need to change the political 
infrastructure 
to 
implement 

preventative measures against 
future environmental disasters 
and better accommodate the 
victims of climate change.

Klein also spoke about the 

power 
of 
corporations 
that 

wield finances to exert political 

influence. 
She 
referenced 

billionaires Charles and David 
Koch’s $889 million contribution 
to a network of conservative 
advocacy groups as an example 
of “slowing down the march 
toward collectivism.”

By contrast, Klein pointed 

to the water crisis in nearby 
Flint, Mich. as an illustration 
of the power a collective efforts 
in 
addressing 
environmental 

justice issues. The discovery of 
lead in the water supply created 
a host of problems for the 
community, but local pressure 
to address the issue has led to 
progress mitigating it.

“This region is so blessed to 

have some of the most inspiring 

grassroots organizers … with a 
vision of a future that could be 
so much better,” Klein said.

Klein also spoke about how 

benefits related to recycling, watching 
waste, composting and eating less 
meat could lower individual carbon 
footprints — but stressed that 
individual efforts cannot come in lieu 
of regulatory policy.

“If 
we 
aren’t 
regulating 

corporations, we’re going to get 
nowhere,” she said.

“It’s not just enough that we 

have a green economy … we need 
a fair economy. That means we 
need principles,” Klein later 
added. “The first principle: no 
new fossil fuel infrastructure … 
The money we need to pay for 

this great transformation is out 
there, we just have to go after 
it, whether that means an end 
to fossil fuel subsidies, financial 
transaction 
taxes, 
increased 

royalties for fossil fuel extraction 
and cuts to military spendings.”

LSA senior Nicholas Jansen, 

who 
is 
involved 
with 
the 

Divest and Invest organization 
on campus, an international 
environmentalist 
group 
that 

lobbies universities to divest 
from fossil fuels, said Klein 
spoke to several points the 
organization aims to promote.

“We’ve really, especially this 

past year, started incorporating 
this climate justice narrative 
around 
our 
issues,” 
Jansen 

said. “Naomi, she touched on 
perfectly today why these issues 
are important, mainly that those 
who have contributed the least 
are being affected the most.”

LSA senior Valeriya Epshteyn, 

also a member of Divest and 
Invest in attendance Monday 
night, said she envisions a world 
wherein special interests and 
individuals don’t overshadow the 
collective good.

“We hope to achieve this 

collective power and a collective 
vision toward climate justice 
which pushes forth a just energy 
transition where the people that 
are most directly affected by 
climate change are lifted up as the 
center of a narrative,” she said.

for the Prechter Lab, said she 
thought the lecture provided the 
audience with the science behind 
depression and bipolar disorder.

“It was a lot to take in, but it 

was really interesting to see how 
far we’ve come,” Eter said.

Eter said Hood’s view on 

genetic diagnosis is a developing 
topic in health care.

“It isn’t a big focus right now, 

but it should be,” Eter said. 
“(The Prechter Lab) looks at a 
lot of things that relate to that 
disorder, and one of those things 
is genetics.”

Melvin 
McInnis, 
principal 

investigator of the Prechter Fund, 
said the study of bipolar disorder 
is intriguing because the disorder 
in many ways represents the 
spectrum of human emotion.

“The study of bipolar disorder 

is truly the study of humanity, the 
range of human experience, the 
depth of the depression, the top of 
the highs,” he said. “The range of 
expression, emotion and behavior 
is the range of human behavior as 
we know it today.”

CARLY KEYES | VIEWPOINT

L

ast week, as Halloween revelries and 
frights were at the forefront of many 
minds, I learned about a different type 

of “troll” responsible for 
disturbing an entire com-
munity and causing con-
troversy. The stories and 
articles I read didn’t discuss 
ghoulish, hideous creatures 
lurking in the darkness 
behind trees. Rather, they 
described a population of 
Internet “trolls,” exhibiting 
horrifying sexism as they 
ominously lurked behind 
keyboards 
and 
glowing 

computer screens.

With immense barriers 

to entry and a reputation as a historically male-
dominated domain, women struggle to enter and 
be taken seriously in the technology industry. 
When they do so, they often are met with back-
lash. The world we live in is one of continuous 
technological advancement, where digital media 
is undeniably and inextricably tied to our lives. 
Yet, for women, when it comes to technology and 
media, we’re expected to merely be passive con-
sumers. Even then, our participation in commu-
nities of consumption, whether online or in real 
life, must be navigated carefully. We’re expected 
to swallow our voices and refrain from alter-
ing, critiquing or creating anything of our own. 
Women who do dare to challenge the status quo 
of tech culture have often become victims of 
online harassment and — in extreme circum-
stances — the recipients of violent threats.

GamerGate, the notorious population of Inter-

net users known for issuing such derogatory 
commentary and threats to female critics of sex-
ism within the video game industry, has spurred 
immense conversation about online harassment 
in recent months. As a result, the pressing topic 
of making the Internet a safer space for women 
is one that researchers, designers, tech experts 
and activists felt needed to be discussed at the 
South by Southwest Interactive Conference this 
coming March. SXSW is a digital culture festival 
focused on technology, music, film and journal-
ism, and was recently in the midst of accepting 
discussion panels for the upcoming event.

Two of these prospective panels were at the 

center of the online harassment discussion. 
One, called “Level Up: Overcoming Harass-
ment in Games,” was comprised of women who 
personally experienced online harassment and 
sought to combat the actions of Internet trolls 
by modifying web design elements, such as post-
ing options, layouts and privacy settings. The 
other panel, called “SavePoint: A Discussion on 
the Gaming Community,” was believed to have 
been comprised of pro-GamerGate participants 
and was going to focus on a broader overview of 
the current culture and gaming journalism eth-
ics. Numerous threats of rape, animal abuse and 
violence were levied online against these panels. 
As a result, SXSW organizers cancelled both.

Uproar, negative media attention and threats 

of boycotts from major media organizations, 
such as BuzzFeed and Vox Media, soon fol-
lowed this decision. In recognition of their blun-

der, organizers of the tech conference recently 
announced that one full day of the summit will 
be devoted to addressing and combating online 
harassment.

The actions of SXSW organizers point to 

larger issues of whether tech cultures and the 
organizations that thrive within them truly 
care about diversity and being inclusive, or 
whether they’re more concerned about filling 
quotas, checking off requirements and preserv-
ing a progressive public image.

Security was cited as the major rationale 

behind the cancellation of the two panels, and 
safety of participants must always remain a 
top priority at all times. But SXSW organiz-
ers exhibited little concern when members of 
the “Level Up” panel initially expressed con-
cerns about security when their panel was first 
accepted into the conference program. Also, 
organizers of the event neglected to inform 
members of either panel about these threats 
until the forums were cancelled. Considering 
the sheer size and notoriety of the individuals 
who regularly attend the event, such as actors 
and musicians, obtaining proper security seems 
within the realm of possibility.

In the announcement of cancellation of 

these two forums, SXSW Director Hugh For-
rest stated, “If people cannot agree, disagree 
and embrace new ways of thinking in a safe and 
secure place that is free of online and offline 
harassment, then this marketplace of ideas is 
inevitably compromised.”

However, it’s the potential action of almost 

silencing this debate that compromises the 
integrity of the SXSW festival. Silencing a 
debate about eradicating harassment against 
women solely in response to the immense 
harassment levied against it is illogical and 
hypocritical. This action suggests that women 
must not only accept the possibility of being 
exposed to offensive, aggressive commentary, 
but also that they cannot escape this harass-
ment online or in real life. Women, as suggested 
by the cancellation of these earlier forums, are 
even inhibited from obtaining spaces where 
they can safely challenge the sexism they 
repeatedly encounter and do so in an environ-
ment where they’re respected and heard.

This action begs one to question what would 

have happened if giant media players hadn’t 
admirably and rightly pulled themselves from the 
conference. What if there was no pressure on the 
organizers to buckle under? Would this discus-
sion have merely been tossed aside and ignored?

The sheer amount of threats and derogatory 

comments makes it clear that this conversation 
shouldn’t be ignored and these voices — ones 
that have continually been threatened and 
silenced for fear of retribution for speaking up 
— need to be heard. Women face harassment 
in a variety of ways, offline and online. Online 
harassment — in whatever form it takes — will 
not end easily, but if we as a society truly want 
a cultural upheaval, we need to stop placing 
impediments in front of those who try to speak 
up and make changes.

W

ithin 10 minutes of talk-
ing to another Univer-
sity student about their 

summer, I’ll very 
often start feel-
ing very shitty 
about 
myself. 

Whether 
they 

interned at Tesla 
or spent a month 
touring Europe, 
I compare myself 
to 
this 
other 

student 
based 

solely on their 
retelling of how 
they spent their 
time 
between 

semesters.

And it’s not as if I’m not in on this 

game either; my summer before 
this semester was also certifiably 
awesome and disgustingly suited 
for #TBTs on Insta. I spent a month 
in India through a Center for Global 
and Intercultural Study program, 
worked as a summer intern at an 
architecture firm in Detroit and 
visited my family in Germany for 
my half-brother’s wedding. Yet, 
even with my own wonderful expe-
riences, I am seemingly unable to 
genuinely express my happiness for 
others’ summer successes. Instead, 
when I hear of others doing well, 
I panic and ask myself what I’m 
doing wrong. This bizarrely com-
petitive nature is not the only nega-
tive mindset I’ve recently observed 
in myself with regard to my peers. 
If I find myself talking to someone 
who spent their summer just taking 

classes or chilling, I become aware 
of a distinct smugness with myself 
that I don’t recognize. But what has 
led to these stupidly competitive 
and assholian thoughts?

One theory I have is the fact that 

I’ve finally started opening myself 
up to the world of “professional-
ism.” The words “networking” and 
“connections” still make me feel 
dirty, but I’ve essentially given into 
them and sold my soul. By building a 
well-stocked LinkedIn profile, and 
even participating in the Engineer-
ing Career Fair, I’ve opened myself 
up to the competitive and compara-
tive world of Real Jobs. And now 
that I’m looking at myself and try-
ing to discern my value to potential 
employers, I think I’m beginning 
to do the same with my peers. Am 
I subconsciously basing my value of 
others on their qualifications? The 
idea of that absolutely disgusts me, 
but what if it’s true? The transition 
from student to young professional 
is a crucial component of a univer-
sity education, but I didn’t expect 
that my mindset about how I spend 
my time would impact me in the 
way it has.

In the process of this change, 

one aspect I have always admired 
most about myself is now seem-
ing to come at a price: I’ve always 
valued novelty and uniqueness in 
myself and others. In other words, 
I love the feeling of surprising oth-
ers when I mention the seemingly 
unrelated, yet important activities 
that I’m involved with. Take, for 
example, my involvement in the 

Indian dance community. It won’t 
necessarily help me get a comput-
er science job, but it has so much 
intangible value that isn’t visible 
on a resume. And this is, unfor-
tunately, starting to bother me. 
Should I even continue to expand 
and explore? Or should I focus on 
and hone in on one activity or field, 
and become the (leader and) best at 
that one thing?

I seem to be constantly reevalu-

ating my priorities as a young adult 
at the University. And while self-
reflection is crucial and neces-
sary, comparing myself to others is 
not. I called my mom at one point 
about this during the semester and 
expressed my concern about how 
far behind I am in comparison to 
other computer science majors. 
After patiently listening to my 
spiel, she calmly explained to me 
that there is no such thing as being 
behind. Everyone follows their own 
path in life, with different goals, 
values and expectations. It is lit-
erally impossible to be “behind” 
someone when each path is its own. 
While I can intellectually grasp 
that concept, I am still working on 
its execution. A little motivational 
competition is healthy, and it’s 
hard not to compare others’ success 
with your own, but as long as you’re 
forging your own academic/profes-
sional/WHATEVER path and giv-
ing it your all, you have nothing to 
 

worry about.

On November 2, 2010, I didn’t 

wake up. I regained consciousness 
… courtesy of alcohol. Whenever I 
drank, I didn’t fall asleep; I blacked 
out, and then I passed out. I never 
really woke up in a typical fashion, 
either. This used to be routine. It 
was life. 

But now, I get to wake up, and I 

get to fall asleep. That’s what I did 
this morning, and that’s what I have 
planned for later, because today, I 
celebrate five years of continuous, 
uninterrupted sobriety.

My life is so different from five 

years ago that I sometimes forget 
that waking up and falling asleep is 
a privilege. I forget about hundreds 
of blackouts, mortifying mornings 
after, losing my Division I soccer 
career, needing to medically with-
draw from semesters, multiple 
drunk-driving arrests and the jail 
time and probation sentences, the 
breathalyzer that was in my car 
for years and the hospital visit that 
saved my life. 

I’m grateful that I don’t have 

to carry a torch for my past and 
play those old tapes 24/7, but at 
the same time, I keep that door 
ajar. While my sobriety date is 
sacred, the day before I got sober 
is arguably even more important. 
What I endured that day was noth-
ing legally related or medically 
induced. It had nothing to do with 
failing school or losing a profes-
sional opportunity. This loss was 
nothing external.

On November 2, 2010, I learned 

the true meaning of disappointment. 
 

I had slept most of the day. It was 

rare that I ever got more than a day 
off from my job as a server at an 
Italian restaurant, but that week, 
I’d managed to trade some shifts. 
Most people would use back-to-
back days off for running errands, 
fixing things around the house or 
relaxing and finishing a good book. 
For me, it meant 48 undisturbed 
hours of drinking without having to 
go anywhere, see anyone … or have 
anyone see me.

At about 5:30 p.m., I got a call 

from my mom to remind me about 
our dinner with my Nanna (who is 
my world). I scrambled to throw 
on something a quarter-way decent 
from my wardrobe that had perma-
nently shifted from closet to floor. 
I put on the one pair of black pants 
that I wore over and over again to 
work and an oversized sweater. I 
took a minute to brush my teeth, 
but only to hide more evidence of 
how I was really doing.

I sped to the restaurant feel-

ing like I’d been hit by a train, run 

over by a car and dragged behind a 
dogsled over concrete ice. I parked 
haphazardly and pulled open the 
brilliant mahogany doors to a fancy 
seafood place feeling a lot more like 
a creature from a dish on the menu 
than a person deserving of a freshly 
starched napkin. My hair in a squir-
rel’s nest and my skin like smudges 
on a chalkboard, I then started to 
sweat, so you can add that lovely 
ingredient to the bubbling pot of 
scalding mess. 

My Nanna looked stunning. She 

always looked stunning. I’m sure 
she’d spent hours that day getting 
ready for our outing: doing her hair, 
selecting her outfit, spraying her-
self with perfume, just so. She was 
90 years old at the time, and every-
thing about her was pure class, pure 
bliss, pure love.

And then, across the table, there 

was me. I almost didn’t want to 
hug her because I could sense that 
both she and my mom knew that I 
wasn’t OK, but one of my favorite 
things about my Nanna were her 
hugs. They were so deep and pur-
poseful. Sometimes, people hug 
each other out of formality, but I 
hugged my Nanna out of necessity 
— every time.

This is the woman who sent me 

a card every week that I was in 
rehab. This is the woman that said 
to me, “Carly, above all else, hold 
on to love.” There was no judgment 
here. There was no anger. There 
wasn’t 
even 
disappointment. 

There was only pain and fear. She 
reached out her arms, and I took 
them. Willingly.

The true disappointment that 

I mentioned? That was all me. In 
myself.

At the end, it wasn’t fun. It wasn’t 

glamorous. It wasn’t even enjoy-
able. Drinking was … required. If 
I was awake, I was drinking. Not 
because I wanted to, but because I 
have a disease called addiction, and 
that’s the unfortunate symptom 
when I try to ignore the truth about 
my illness.

I hadn’t been at the table for 

more than a few minutes when 
I needed to throw up. I excused 
myself politely, walked as slowly 
as I could manage until I was out 
of sight, and then I barged through 
yet another set of brilliant mahoga-
ny doors, sprinted over marble floor 
tiles and past granite countertops 
and ornate lighting fixtures where I 
arrived at my destination: looming 
above a five-star toilet.

This happened four more times 

over the course of the appetizer, 
salad, dinner and dessert. Every 

time a new batch of food came, 
I excused myself because I was 
“drinking so much water.” It was, 
of course, because the fifths of 
Absolut still oozing from my pores 
ensured that my mouth would feel 
like the driest day in the heart of 
Arizona. And the shrimp gumbo 
infesting my nostrils wasn’t help-
ing my lack of homeostasis, but that 
wasn’t really why I kept needing to 
leave the table. 

I just couldn’t look my Nanna in 

the eye. She passed away on May 9, 
2014, and there’s nothing I wouldn’t 
give for one more hug. There’s noth-
ing I wouldn’t do to get back those 
minutes that I spent that evening 
hunched over in the stall and spend 
them with her now.

After dinner, I went home and 

I drank another fifth of Absolut 
Peach and a two-liter of Sunkist, 
and it was the last time I’ve put 
alcohol or any other mind-altering 
substance into my body.

Consequences helped me get 

sober, but they aren’t what keep me 
sober on a daily basis. Devastation 
forced me to my knees, but it’s the 
freedom it brings that keeps me 
there — and also, a life beyond my 
wildest dreams that I never could 
have imagined for myself.

The moment I made the decision 

to quit drinking, a whole new world 
opened up for me. In this world, I 
don’t get arrested or have to go to 
the hospital and leave school and 
give up my passions. It is a world 
where I don’t worry the people I 
love most or harbor disappointment 
for my behavior. This is the world 
of recovery, which for me is fueled 
by personal work within a 12-step 
program, participation in the Col-
legiate Recovery Program and Stu-
dents for Recovery at the University 
and advocacy efforts in the name of 
all those who suffer from the same 
disease that I have. 

During the last years of my Nan-

na’s life, she became more and more 
immobile, and I visited her as often 
as I could. We’d play cards and 
Scrabble. We always had a proper 
lunch. I’d play her piano and sing 
to her, and she would peacefully 
fall asleep. But, regardless of what 
we did during those special after-
noons, if I said I would be there, I 
was there, and I was there sober. 
She never, ever had to doubt it for 
a second. 

We can’t change the past, but we 

can make up for lost minutes. As 
long as we’re alive and breathing, 
we have a chance.

LITERATURE COLUMN

Exploring ‘Jest’

T

he start of my enthrall-
ment with David Foster 
Wallace would have 

infuriated the deceased, reclu-
sive author — it began when 
I watched 
someone else 
espouse his 
ideas in a film 
version of his 
life. I found 
his persona 
fascinating 
in “The End 
of the Tour,” 
the movie 
adaptation 
of last few days of the “Infinite 
Jest” book tour. Upon further 
research after viewing the film, 
Foster’s magnetism drew me in 
even more. I decided I had to 
embark upon a literary journey 
unlike any other I have previ-
ously contemplated — I had to 
read “Infinite Jest.”

But to read “Infinite Jest” is 

to voyeuristically look into Wal-
lace’s past, which provided much 
of the backbone of the novel. 
Wallace, born in 1962, attended 
Amherst College and struggled 
with depression and addiction 
to drugs and alcohol throughout 
much of his young life. After 
writing “Infinite Jest,” which is 
1,100 pages with 330 footnotes, 
Wallace continued to write and 
teach at Emerson College and 
Illinois State University. On Sept. 
12, 2008, Wallace committed sui-
cide in California. The few inter-
views with Wallace, who is such 
a soft-spoken, fumbling neurotic, 
are captivating and heartbreak-
ing.

The most difficult question 

to answer about “Infinite Jest” 
is: what is it about? Because the 
answer is everything. There are 
over 1,000 pages of content about 
depression, loneliness, addiction, 
tennis, familial relations and love 
on which you can focus.

As Dave Eggers said in his 

original review of the novel, 
“Infinite Jest” is “more about 

David Foster Wallace than any-
thing else.” Eggers, who wrote the 
foreword for the most recent edi-
tion, is correct. It’s about Wallace’s 
deep desires and secrets, but most 
of all it’s about what he wanted for 
the future of his craft. Wallace was 
hell-bent on changing fiction 
 —and 

he did. This book is confusing and 
strange and downright disgust-
ing at times. But it is beautiful and 
challenges its readers like nothing 
else ever has.

It is set in the future in a uni-

fied North American superstate 
called the Organization of North 
American Nations, or O.N.A.N. 
There is not a chronological plot 
or a clear-cut conclusion — we 
jump from location to location, 
from characters we get to know 
well to characters with agoniz-
ing secrets to whom we are only 
exposed once.

There are two major loca-

tions in which the stories take 
place: the prep school, Enfield 
Tennis Academy and, down the 
street, the Ennet House Drug and 
Alcohol Recovery House. The 
physical closeness of these two 
locations leads to the intertwining 
storylines. James O. Incandenza, 
the patriarch of the Incandenza 
Family, has recently committed 
suicide. He was a filmmaker and 
the founder of Enfield Tennis 
Academy, and the plot somewhat 
revolves around the missing mas-
ter copy of his last piece of work, 
titled “Infinite Jest.” Canadian 
separatists are attempting to 
locate “Infinite Jest” to commit 
terrorist acts against the United 
States. The novel carefully exam-
ines the neuroses of the rest of 
the Incandenza family and the 
way that their insanity bleeds 
into the school. But some of the 
most jarring parts of “Infinite 
Jest” come from the sections on 
Ennet House, where Wallace 
unforgivingly examines the gro-
tesque and disgusting parts of the 
human psyche.

When I told people that I 

was reading “Infinite Jest” for 

my literature column, everyone 
seemed to have a considerable 
reaction. “Wow, but it’s so long!” 
was a common one. A fellow Daily 
Arts Writer warned me that she 
heard it was a “bro book,” which 
is valid, as the novel is mostly 
concerned with the preoccupa-
tions and compulsions of its men. 
But the most common reply was 
“I haven’t read it yet.” In my life 
full of predominantly English and 
humanities majors and professors, 
only one and a half people have 
actually read “Infinite Jest” — one 
friend has read the first 400 pages 
three times but hasn’t gotten past 
that point.

For all the novel’s glory and rec-

ognition, it seems impossible that 
so many academics and students 
still have not read it. I’ll admit it; 
the sheer depth of it is intimidat-
ing. For the first few days after 
buying it, it sat next to my bed 
while I just admired it and tried 
to wrap my head around the fact 
that I would be reading over 1,000 
of the most acclaimed pages ever. 
Before actually plucking up the 
courage to start reading, I used 
“Infinite Jest” as a small stand 
for my computer and a weight for 
my arm exercises. But the book is 
incredible because even with so 
much content, in the actual book, 
it never felt like any of it was 
unnecessary. Even the three hun-
dred or so footnotes are entirely 
essential to understanding any of 
the plots. Every page felt heavy 
with the importance that Wallace 
so delicately embedded in it.

“The truth will set you free. 

But not until it is finished with 
you.” This line stuck with me 
until the end of the novel. But this 
book has so much truth in it that 
you would have it read it about 10 
more times before you ever get 
close to liberation. It seems the 
only thing to do is pick it up and 
start again.

TV REVIEW
Triumphant ‘Dance’

By SAM ROSENBERG

For The Daily

Young adulthood can be one of 

the most transformative periods 
in a person’s life, as well as one of 
the most chal-
lenging. 
It’s 

a time when 
you 
develop 

relationships, 
become 
inde-

pendent 
and 

figure out what 
you want to do 
with the rest of 
your life. How-
ever, being a 
young 
adult 

also involves dealing with a lot of 
angst and self-doubt. In her touch-
ing documentary “How to Dance 
in Ohio,” filmmaker Alexandra 
Shiva (“Stagedoor”) offers some 
insight on this topic by focusing 
on a group of teenagers and young 
adults from Columbus, Ohio all of 
whom are on the autism spectrum. 
With the help of clinical psycholo-
gist Emilio Amigo at his family 
counseling center, these individu-
als spend 12 weeks preparing for 
their first spring formal dance, 
learning how to improve their 
social and communication skills — 
and of course, how to dance.

Filmed in 2013 and premiered 

at this year’s Sundance Film Fes-
tival, “How to Dance in Ohio” 
gives more than a simple depiction 
of people with autism. Through 
Shiva’s sensitive direction and the 
film’s unobtrusive cinematogra-
phy, “How to Dance in Ohio” high-
lights the daunting experience 
of breaking out of your comfort 
zone and how it can lead to per-
sonal growth. Nothing about this 
film feels manipulative or exploit-
ative; rather, it offers viewers the 
chance to see both the struggles 
and triumphs of young people with 
autism.

Although the film portrays the 

sessions that take place at Ami-
go’s Family Counseling, it mostly 
centers around the perspectives 
of three young women from the 
group: Marideth Bridges, 16; Car-
oline McKenzie, 19; and Jessica 
Sullivan, 22. Regardless of their 
different ages, they each encoun-
ter difficulties in learning how to 
adapt to the world around them.

Marideth, 
a 
self-described 

introvert, spends most of her time 
on the computer and reading ran-
dom facts in world almanacs. She 
also likes researching, but feels 
uncomfortable explaining to the 
camera what she is researching 
exactly. Though Marideth’s perse-
verant habits and her reluctance to 
interact with others are common 
among people with autism, the 
film conveys just how hard it can 
be to live with such a condition. In 
one of the film’s most heartbreak-
ing scenes, Marideth expresses to 
her parents at a sit-down restau-
rant that she might not want to 
have kids and wonders if she will 
even get married some day. It’s 
an emotionally stirring moment 
that’s guaranteed to make view-
ers’ hearts drop, yet it reminds the 
audience that Marideth’s autism 
doesn’t need to hinder her from 
living a normal life.

As a director and storyteller, 

Shiva does a great job of showing 
how people with autism are just as 
ambitious and open to opportuni-
ties as anyone else. For example, 
Caroline mentions her enrollment 
as a student at Columbus State 
Community College, her hopes 
of becoming an early childhood 
educator and her dream of trav-
eling to Japan. Early in the film, 
Jessica negotiates a plan with her 
parents to live on her own, and 
she is later seen working at a bak-
ery called Food for Good Thought 
for young adults on the spectrum. 
But much like Marideth, Caroline 
and Jessica undergo the stresses 
of social anxiety and the pressures 

of being perceived by others in a 
negative way. Caroline agonizes 
over dancing well at the formal 
and what to do if she becomes too 
overwhelmed to ride the public 
bus to class. Jessica becomes frus-
trated when the bakery’s owner, 
a psychologist named Dr. Audrey 
Todd, tells her that Jessica has 
developed a superior attitude 
towards her co-workers. Despite 
Jessica, Caroline and Marideth’s 
ongoing difficulties with fitting 
into the mainstream, the film 
presents their situations in a hon-
est and respectful light. In addi-
tion, the interviews with their 
families showcase both the con-
cern and support that they have 
for their children who go through 
this difficult journey every day.

While the film can be very 

emotional at times, there are some 
humorous and sweet moments as 
well. In one scene, Marideth and 
her younger sister discuss Chief 
Keef, the irrelevance of Soulja 
Boy, the turbulence of Miley 
Cyrus’s career and long-haired 
men. The sequence where Caro-
line and Jessica go shopping for 
formal dresses with their mothers 
is also particularly heartwarm-
ing. Not only do these clips give 
the documentary heart and depth, 
but they also illustrate how young 
adults with autism have the same 
interests and goals as any other 
young adult. At the actual for-
mal, the climax of “How to Dance 
in Ohio,” you can see how this 
group has developed so quickly 
and overcome their initial fears in 
such a short amount of time. The 
only arguably flawed moment in 
this film is the inclusion of Katy 
Perry’s pop hit “Firework” in the 
credits scene. But even though 
“Firework” makes the ending 
slightly cheesy, you can’t help but 
feel overjoyed to watch these indi-
viduals do something that most 
people with autism don’t get the 
chance to do.

FESTIVAL REPORT

Killers’ classic debut

By REGAN DETWILER and 

RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writers

This week, Daily Music Writ-

ers are looking back on the first 
albums they ever loved. Today, 
Regan Detwiler and Rachel Kerr 
remember The Killers’ Hot Fuss. 

I first heard “Mr. Brightside” 

when I was nine years old, on my 
home town’s locally owned alter-
native station. It quickly became 
a car ride highlight, and soon my 
mom bought the Hot Fuss CD 
from Barnes & Noble. Months 
later when I heard it on the local 
pop station, I felt that first twinge 
of angry dejection at the injustice 
of hearing a song that you dis-
covered out for the whole world 
to hear. (Thus began my life as 
an obnoxious alternative music 
snob.)

My nine years of life thus far 

had been fairly — OK, incred-
ibly — innocent. I was that kid 
who wasn’t allowed to watch PG 
movies (don’t even think about 
PG-13). It’s no surprise that “Mr. 
Brightside” sparked my excit-
able curiosity: I didn’t know 
what “taking a drag” was — dare 
I guess? This, and lines like “But 
she’s touching his chest now” 
and “He takes off her dress now, 
letting me go” made my imagina-
tion wander to places I had never 
been.

This mysteriously and darkly 

ambiguous lyrical style paired 
with 
The 
Killers’ 
perfume-

stained 
velvet 
rock 
carries 

through the whole album, which 
I listened to religiously well into 
the next couple of years. Memo-
rizing every word and every 
melody, I indulged myself in 
imaginative gymnastics in an 
effort to decode the messages 
waiting behind the shadowy 
phrases, like in “Believe Me 
Natalie”: “Forget what they said 
in SoHo, leave the oh-no’s out” 
— what could they have said in 
SoHo? What were the oh-no’s?

As a sort of musical coming-of-

age, Hot Fuss not only appealed 
to more explorative aspects of 
this stage in life, but also to the 

turbulent emotions character-
istic of pre-adolescence. Lying 
alone in my room, a pathetic 
puddle of self-pity after my first 
real fights with my parents, I 
must have listened to “Every-
thing Will Be Alright” a million 
times over the course of about 
two years. But at least I had “All 
These Things That I’ve Done” to 
pick me back up.

This was also my best friend’s 

favorite album at the time, so 
when our families made the 
13-hour drive to South Carolina 
that summer, you know what 
was in the CD player. We drove 
through the Rockies with the 
sun up and the windows down 
and let Hot Fuss play three times 
through. Now when I hear a song 
from this album on the radio, I 
can start singing the next track 
on the album as soon as that one 
ends. 

 — Regan Detwiler
It’s December 2004 in Las 

Vegas. I’m at the Rubio’s, six min-
utes away from my house with 
my grandma, eating a chicken 
burrito off the kids’ menu. At the 
table next to me is Ronnie Van-
nucci, eating a quesadilla, alone. 
For all of you who weren’t obses-
sively in to The Killers, Ronnie 
Vannucci is their drummer and 
for all of you who grew up east of 
the Rocky Mountains, Rubio’s is 
a Mexican fast food chain.

“That’s the drummer of the 

band that sings ‘Mr. Brightside!!!’ ” 
I whispered to my grandma. And 
of course, she knew what I was 
referring too because, in 2004, 
even 60-year-old women couldn’t 
avoid that song. She urged me to 
say something to him — “tell him 
how much you like his band!” 
— but she didn’t understand. I 
didn’t like his band, I loved his 
band. And would I even say?

Should I start by apologiz-

ing for even recognizing him? I 
mean, how often does the drum-
mer of an up-and-coming band 
get stopped in public places? And 
by a nine-year-old, no less? How 
did I explain that’d I memorized 
all their faces and that Brandon 
Flowers, the lead singer, was my 

first real crush?

Or do I just begin by thank-

ing him for Hot Fuss, the band’s 
debut album, my first favor-
ite album, full of Joy Division 
decadence and Depeche Mode 
moods? Or even further, for my 
yet realized love of ’80s pop-rock 
music, whose origin could only 
later be traced back to years of 
listening to Hot Fuss and their 
follow up album, Sam’s Town, on 
repeat?

Do I mention that I, like the 

band, am also from Las Vegas? 
Or maybe explain that I noticed 
the influence the city had had 
on the album, from its grandi-
ose production to its lush lyrics, 
and wanted to thank them for 
capturing how it feels to live in 
Las Vegas in a sound? Could I 
tell him that I really identified 
with the “Sin City” cynicism of 
the album, despite being in ele-
mentary school and not having 
any idea what that even meant 
yet?

Was it weird to tell him that 

my dad had cried to “All These 
Things That I’ve Done?” To 
explain 
that 
the 
otherwise 

tough guy who openly discussed 
his atheism with his 10-year-
old daughter had been deeply 
affected by the line “I got soul 
but I’m not a soldier” because 
it explained how he felt about 
grappling with faith and moral-
ity and the meaning of life.

Or did I just tell him that I 

liked his shirt because it was a 
really pretty shade of blue?

No, I couldn’t say any of these 

things to him, so I panicked and 
decided to say nothing. I let him 
continue to eat his quesadilla, 
while I nervously continued to 
gawk at him eating his quesa-
dilla. When I got home, I went 
straight to my room and let Hot 
Fuss play over and over and over 
again, because how many times 
do you get to see the drummer 
of your favorite band at Rubio’s? 
Probably only once. And how 
many times to you get to have a 
first favorite album? Definitely 
only once.

YouT
ube all grown up

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Last weekend, the third annu-

al Buffer Festival welcomed You-
Tube filmmakers from across to 
globe to Toronto. The familiar 
videos we usually watch on our 
personal mobile devices and 
laptops streamed in front of live 
audiences in the extravagant 
theaters of Toronto’s historic 
entertainment district. And the 
familiar YouTubers we connect-
ed with through a screen graced 
a red carpet before us, discussing 
their work with us personally.

Less chaotic than the fan-

crazed Playlist Live, less uptight 
than the business venture Vid-
Con has become, the humble 
Canadian Buffer Fest empha-
sizes not the lucrative business 
behind YouTube, but the struc-
tured, 
scripted, 
high-quality 

content emerging on the plat-
form. Spread over three days, 
videos were screened in catego-
ries: short films, comedy sketch-
es, travel and adventure, gaming 
and animation, among others.

“YouTube is moving toward 

a direction of professionalism,” 
said Corrado Coia of Apprenti-
ceA Productions, one of the four 
co-founders of Buffer. “Some of 
these YouTubers have feature-
length films in episodic format, 
and they do actually rival Holly-
wood quality. So they need to get 
the proper treatment — get them 
in a nice theater.”

Events 
like 
Buffer 
also 

encourage creators to experi-
ment beyond new media — to 
work with podcasts, long-form 
scripted film, TV pilots — to mix 
other mediums with YouTube.

Adrianna 
DiLonardo 
and 

Sarah Rotella of the Gay Women 
Channel are the writer and 
director, respectively, of “Almost 
Adults,” a coming-of-age LGBTQ 
feature film that was funded on 
Kickstarter.

“(YouTubers are) using new 

media and their fan base to 
launch them into what they 
want to be doing outside of new 
media.” Rotella said. “Everyone 
is making their own content, but 
all of these YouTubers are get-
ting books and doing movies, 

too.”

The effect of their film has had 

a trickle-down effect. Firstly, 
they have integrated their exist-
ing YouTube fan base into view-
ership for their film. Secondly, 
their loyal subscribers have 
become devoted to the movie’s 
actors, who have their own up-
and-coming channels. Winny 
Clarke, a budding actress who 
plays Elliot in “Almost Adults,” 
just launched her own channel 
in October and plans to produce 
weekly comedy sketches.

“The traffic that the Gay 

Women Channel has is amaz-
ing, so every time I do something 
with them, it just sends traffic my 
way, as well,” Clark said.

The best part though, as 

DiLondardo noted, is that “it’s 
nice being your own boss.”

Similarly, Louis Cole, who has 

gained a following of over 1.6 mil-
lion subscribers with his travel 
videos, mentioned how he’s ready 
to experiment beyond vlogging. 
Next year, he’s scheduled to cir-
cumnavigate the world in a plane 
with fellow YouTuber, JP.

“I’d love to explore partnering 

with someone and creating long-
form content, like a documenta-
ry, would be fun,” he said.

Cole predicts the future of new 

media will look quite different.

“I think everything will over-

lap, but there’ll be specific con-
tent on different platforms,” Cole 
said. “So there’s still gonna be the 
very homemade relatable content 
on YouTube. There’ll also be the 
high-end content other sites put 
out like with their subscription 
service. I don’t think that’s gonna 
replace the homemade content.”

However, 
Cole’s 
sentiment 

about homemade content may be 
challenged by the very platform 
that encourages him to experi-
ment. On Oct. 21, just two days 
prior to Buffer Fest, YouTube 
Chief Business Officer, Robert 
Kyncl, 
announced 
“YouTube 

Red” — a $9.99 monthly sub-
scription service that that allows 
for ad-free, offline streaming.

Red will also feature exclusive 

original content from the most 
popular YouTubers. Felix Kjell-
berg (PewDiePie) has already 
unveiled a reality-horror series, 

produced 
by 
“The 
Walking 

Dead” creators. A Lilly Singh 
(||Superwoman||) 
world 
tour 

documentary is also projected. 
Thus, Red will prompt creators 
to strive for high-quality, high 
production-value content, much 
like the material screened at Buf-
fer Fest.

On the other hand, many at 

Buffer Fest wondered if, in the 
aim for higher quality, YouTube 
is trying too hard to be the love-
child of Netflix and Spotify pre-
mium – trying too hard to become 
the “future of television.”

“I’m not sure I want You-

Tube to look like cable TV when 
it grows up,” said author John 
Green in a recent vlog explaining 
the pros and cons of Red. “You-
Tube isn’t something you watch — 
it’s something you’re part of.”

While Red protects all con-

tent creators (especially small 
up-and-comers) from AdBlock, 
which restricts advertising and 
thus their main stream of rev-
enue, Red arguably creates more 
inequality than the level play-
ing field it intends to. Before, 
YouTube was a flat, universal 
platform of equal opportunity; 
anyone with Internet had just 
as much potential to reach an 
audience as anyone else. How-
ever, Red will create two class-
es of viewers: those who can 
pay and those who can’t. Now, 
regular YouTube users will be 
without access to the high-end 
content that events like Buffer 
Fest emphasize and celebrate.

One petition to stop Red 

already has over 16,000 signa-
tures in just 10 days. YouTube is 
supposed to be an equalizer; a 
platform that anyone, regardless 
of age, nationality, experience, or 
socioeconomic status — can both 
consume and create on. I have 
the same opportunity to make a 
viral video just the same as Jenna 
Marbles once did with her web-
cam. Furthermore, YouTube as 
become a gateway to branch off 
into a variety of other mediums 
– films, podcasts, etc. To create 
inequality at the basic consumer 
level now is to restrict the con-
tent creators of the future. We all 
started as consumers, subscrib-
ers and fans.

TV REVIEW
Welcome but flawed 
‘Supergirl’ premiere

Melissa Benoist 
highlights a shaky 

first effort

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Superheroes are more preva-

lent in media today than ever 
before. However, despite the 
growing num-
ber 
of 
film 

and television 
shows 
featur-

ing caped cru-
saders, 
very 

few have had a 
woman as the 
central 
focus. 

While 
not 

excluded in the 
genre, 
female 

characters are 
usually relegated to the sup-
porting cast or serving as mem-
bers of a larger ensemble. Sure, 
Scarlett Johansson’s (“Lucy”) 
Black Widow is a major member 
of the Avengers, but her preva-
lence is overshadowed by the 
likes of the franchise-anchor-
ing Iron Man, Thor and Captain 
America.

However, with its premiere 

on CBS, “Supergirl” puts women 
front and center, not just in 
the lead but also in several key 
roles. While its lack of subtlety 
can be jarring, “Supergirl” has a 
personable lead in Melissa Ben-
oist (“Whiplash”), in spite of the 
show’s early struggles.

As Kara Zor-El, Superman’s 

cousin who landed on Earth 
several years after her famous 
relative, 
Benoist 
brings 
an 

infectious energy to the pilot. 
Kara wants to make a difference 
in the world, yet initially tries to 
do it without her powers. Find-
ing herself the assistant to media 
mogul Cat Graham (Calista 
Flockhart, “Ally McBeal”), Kara 
works hard but knows she can 
do more.

Once Kara embraces her pow-

ers — after saving a crashing 
plane carrying her adoptive sis-

ter, Alex (Chyler Leigh, “Grey’s 
Anatomy”) — she finds new-
found purpose. With a beaming 
smile and ceaseless enthusiasm, 
Benoist displays this transfor-
mation of Kara with a satisfy-
ing charisma comparable to 
the optimism of Grant Gustin’s 
(“Glee”) portrayal of Barry 
Allen on “The Flash.” As Kara 
develops her suit with the help 
of her friend Winn (Jeremy Jor-
dan, “The Last Five Years”), her 
confidence grows as she devel-
ops the powers she has long 
repressed.

Benoist’s performance helps 

carry “Supergirl” even when 
the show begins to drag. It’s 
important 
to 
have 
women 

anchoring superhero franchis-
es today; addressing this fact 
in the pilot isn’t a misstep, but 
“Supergirl” doesn’t exactly soar 
with the execution. Written 
by Ali Adler (“The New Nor-
mal”), the premiere overstuffs 
itself with ham-fisted dialogue 
meant to emphasize girl-pow-
er. Some attempts work fine 
like a woman in the background 
expressing her happiness about 
a new role model for her daugh-
ter. Also, a speech by Flockhart 
about the term “girl” itself has 
the subtlety of a jackhammer, 
but its point isn’t lost.

However, these moments are 

diluted by less than effective 
instances of female foreground-
ing. A bland alien villain yell-
ing, “On my planet, females bow 
before males,” is groan-worthy. 
Winn’s statement to Kara that 
“You look really pretty without 
your glasses,” is ripped straight 
out of cheesy high school movie.

“Supergirl” ’s focus on Kara’s 

role as a female superhero stems 
from a lack of representation 
of comic book heroines on the 
screen. However, the show 
puts too much of a burden on 
itself to illustrate this relation 
in its plot, which weighs its 
message down. Kara’s female 
identity will probably remain 
a 
central 
focus 
throughout 

the series’ run, as it should, 
but “Supergirl” can definitely 

find more effective and defter 
ways to get its message across. 
“Agent Carter,” showed that 
comic book settings could look 
at issues of sexism and female-
empowerment with a relatively 
mature lens, and hopefully 
“Supergirl” can continue this 
tradition.

“Supergirl” also struggles 

in other aspects of its initial 
development. A brief sisterly 
rivalry between Kara and Alex, 
who happens to be a secret 
agent, is never fully explained. 
Other characters like Cat and 
Winn lack defining dimensions, 
becoming relatively flat in 
their portrayals. Meanwhile, 
the whimsy of the pilot, while 
enjoyable, can detract from 
more dramatic scenes, sparking 
a laugh where one shouldn’t be 
and preventing any seriousness 
from coming across.

However, by bringing Kara 

to the forefront and making 
Superman a faceless, distant 
influence, “Supergirl” is able 
to define its heroine’s role. 
Kara isn’t just a female ver-
sion to Superman as her name 
suggests, but rather, she is a 
continuation of a legacy. She’s 
a powerful being and a force 
to be reckoned with no matter 
what gender she is.

“Supergirl” still has some 

growing pains to work through 
before its full potential and 
message are realized. But, with 
Benoist anchoring the show in 
bright optimism, “Supergirl” 
can potentially establish roots 
and carve out a place for itself 
among the growing retinue of 
television superheroes.

EVENT PREVIEW
Danish quartet in A2

By DAYTON HARE

For The Daily

The string quartet is one of the 

most iconic and enduring genres 
in classical music. Its history 
stretches back 
to the Classical 
Period in the 
18th 
century, 

and the quartet 
has been ubiq-
uitous 
ever 

since. 
Musi-

cians’ mythos 
attribute 
the 

quartet’s 
invention 
to 

the composer 
Joseph Haydn, 
but this is not 
entirely true — he certainly did 
more for it than any of his pre-
decessors, but he wasn’t the first 
to write for an ensemble of two 
violins, a viola and a cello. Over 
the course of his life, however, 
Haydn wrote a mystifying quan-
tity of quartets — around 69 — and 
when his younger friend Wolf-
gang Mozart took up the pen to 
emulate the elder composer, the 
genre was permanently affixed to 
the tradition of Western Classical 
music.

In the centuries following, 

nearly every major composer (and 
innumerable minor ones) wrote 
quartets. Wherever one looks, a 
string quartet can be found, often 
central in the works of any given 
composer; the late quartets of 
Beethoven are sometimes ranked 
as masterworks on par with the 
9th Symphony — the only sur-
viving chamber composition of 
Giuseppe Verdi, the great maestro 
of Italian opera, is his String Quar-
tet in E minor — when Schoenberg 
first revealed his radical theory 
of free atonality to the world, he 
chose to do it through the medium 
of his String Quartet No. 2.

With so many masterworks, it’s 

hardly surprising that some of the 
best ensembles performing today 
are string quartets. For much 
the same reason, however, many 
ensembles today neglect those 
quartets written by contemporary 
composers. The quartet that will 
be performing in Rackham Audi-
torium on Friday is not one such 

negligent ensemble.

The Danish String Quartet is 

internationally renowned. Only 75 
percent Dane, despite their name 
— their cellist is Norwegian — the 
four Scandinavians are known for 
their superb technical and musical 
ability. On Friday, they’ll be pre-
senting a program containing old 
favorites of the genre (Haydn and 
Beethoven), but also a relatively 
new work by respected contem-
porary British composer Thomas 
Adès. While one might expect that 
string quartets have been writ-
ten for so long now that any new 
venture into the genre is bound to 
be anachronistic and unoriginal, 
Adès’s Arcadiana dispels any such 
notion with its enchanting music.

“I had this idea to write this 

particular piece about these sort 
of imaginary idylls from various 
points in art and culture,” Adès 
said of Arcadiana in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “I was 
23 or something like that when I 
wrote it … It was a period when I 
had my first job as composer-in-
residence at the Hallé Orchestra, 
in Manchester.”

Adès spent the early part of his 

life in London. When he started 
his job in Manchester, it was the 
furthest he had ever lived from 
his home, an experience which 
worked its way into Arcadiana.

“I was actually living in the 

countryside — again, which was a 
first for me, a very remote place — 
writing this string quartet,” Adès 
said. “I don’t know why I wasn’t 
writing orchestral pieces, I think I 
just was preferring to write this.”

Conventionally, string quartets 

have four movements. However, 
for much of the 20th century this 
tradition has been regarded by 
composers as being more of a sug-
gestion than a rule, and Adès’s 
view is no exception.

“There are seven movements (in 

Arcadiana), and the second move-
ment is like a kind of electronic 
mashup of The Magic Flute (by 
Mozart),” Adès said. “The fourth 
movement is very much a tango 
— I was listening to Pizzola at the 
time, as we all were, and I was 
enjoying the kind of odd things he 
was doing with tango … the sixth 
movement has a kind of Elgar 
‘ancestry’, I suppose you would say, 

to use a very pompous word.”

When talking about the final 

movement of the piece, Adès refer-
enced his personal experiences in 
Manchester as being a great influ-
ence on it.

“It was a very cold winter … I 

remember one morning waking up 
and looking out the window, and it 
(the cabin where Adès lived) was 
surrounded by fields, and it had 
snowed during the night — and of 
course I had never had that expe-
rience, living in London you don’t 
wake up and see a whole white 
field of snow. And the last move-
ment was definitely sort of born 
that morning.”

In addition to the memory of 

that morning, Adès was inspired by 
mythology and literature when he 
composed the final movement.

“It (the last movement) is called 

‘Lethe’ — the river of forgetfulness 
in Greek Mythology, where the 
departed souls trail their hands 
in the water and they forget their 
whole life,” Adès said. “And it was 
a little from the end of a story by 
(James) Joyce, called ‘The Dead,’ 
which is the last story of ‘Dublin-
ers’, and ends with this beautiful 
passage about the snow falling over 
all the living and the dead.”

“All the movements have things 

like (Adès’s experience with the 
snow) associated with them. In that 
way … it’s a very personal piece,” 
Adès said of Arcadiana.

The piece is also notable for its 

technical challenges, employing 
several methods of playing not fre-
quently found in older repertoire.

“The quartet who commissioned 

it and played the first performance 
… the Endellion Quartet … we had 
an interesting time in the first 
rehearsals,” Adès said. “Because it’s 
demanding instrumentally.”

Despite the difficulty of the 

piece, it continues to be performed 
with some frequency.

“Actually, oddly enough, this 

piece is almost one of my most 
played 
pieces,” 
the 
composer 

remarked. “Many quartets now do 
it — like the Danish String Quartet, 
who are coming (to the University 
of Michigan), and who I just heard 
play it in Copenhagen and actu-
ally play it stunningly. And you’ll 
see, they make it look easy — and 
believe me, it’s not.”

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

This week, Daily Music Writers 

are looking back on the first albums 
they ever loved. Today, Melina 
Glusac remembers Regina Spektor’s 
Begin to Hope.

The year? 2006. To this fledg-

ling music writer, nothing in the 
world housed more promise — more 
ecstasy — than the CD section in 
Best Buy. I would stroll and stumble, 
extending a lanky arm to caress any 
shiny plastic jacket that caught my 
eye, avoiding the side-eyes of the 
half-blue, 
half-khaki 
employees. 

Who was Joni Mitchell? Fifth-grade 
Melina didn’t quite know. But she 
knew the cover of Blue was cool and 
intense and “funky fresh,” as the 
incomparable 2006-Ciara would 
say, and that was good enough.

So you can imagine my surprise 

upon noticing nifty cover art and 
an artist’s name I recognized — 
that elusive duo — one day in Best 
Buy. I remembered Regina Spektor 
from VH1’s weekly music count-
downs (yes, I am 85 years old), and I 
remembered how much I loved her 
song, “Fidelity.” It, of course, was on 
the album I had in my hand — but 
it was also the only song I knew off 
the album. After 10 minutes of con-
templation, Fall Out Boy’s Infinity 
on High in one hand, pure doubt in 
the other, I decided to purchase this 
doubt, this Begin to Hope thing, too. 
Hey, maybe all the other songs on 
it would be as catchy as “Fidelity.” 
Little Mel decided to carpe diem.

I got home, grabbed a book about 

Paris and sat down to listen. Cue all 
clichéd descriptions of first experi-
encing a piece of art that changes 
your life. Tears, joy, sorrow, rejuve-
nation, blah. Good? Okay. Now onto 
the more vital (nerdy) stuff:

When we delve further into 

Begin to Hope, we find its façade 
of semi-pop piano tunes is not at 
all evocative of Spektor’s depth. 
So we tear that down listen after 

listen, and find that she tickles the 
ivories like no other, but — unlike 
her contemporaries — the tickling 
technique differs stunningly with 
each song. “Fidelity” (still one of 
my favorite music videos) employs a 
choppy, kitschy style and juxtapos-
es the fluidity of “20 Years of Snow.” 
Spektor’s punk tendencies shine 
in “That Time,” which is fun and 
sexual and weird (“Hey, remem-
ber that time when you OD’d? Hey, 
remember that other time when 
you OD’d, for the second time?”).

And no one does slow like ReS-

pekt. “Samson” rips me to shreds 
with every listen, as its Biblically-
infused lyrics continue to feed new 
meanings, metaphors and bits of 
poignant imagery. “Field Below” is 
a diamond in the rough, but soulful 
— and soul, I’ve come to find, is Spe-
ktor’s forte. Her love of jazz beams 
in “Lady,” a wink at Billie Holiday, 
complete with a smoky, Sonny 
Rollins-esque sax solo. Then there’s 
“Summer In The City,” my favorite, 
favorite, favorite. No words here 
— it’s all in the feeling, the slight 
slur in her speech, the desperation. 
Someone stop me, please.

Begin to Hope was everything to 

me, then and now. I mark it as the 
beginning of a “musical awaken-
ing,” an era I’ll probably live in my 
whole life: where music reigns and 
I am its voyager, venturing to for-
eign lands in search of fiery mix-
tapes and the cure for heartbreak. 
Hope also started a lifelong love 
affair with Regina Spektor, whom I 
regard as one of the best songwrit-
ers of our generation. It exposed me 
to her brilliant discography (special 
shout outs to Soviet Kitsch and Far). 
I cried Kim Kardashian-style at her 
Detroit concert my sophomore year 
of high school. Her lyrics pop into 
my head almost every day, at ran-
dom times. But, most importantly 
and existentially, she’s there: The 
CD section at Best Buy is almost 
gone, but Spektor will be with me 
always. 

Love and hope

After moment in spotlight, 
Speight no longer unknown

Teammates laud 

quarterback’s poise 
in leading comeback 
against Minnesota

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Just a few months ago, Wilton 

Speight was a relative nobody on 
the Michigan football team. He 
had arrived in Ann Arbor in the 
winter of 2014 as a highly touted 
quarterback, but one who had to 
bide his time.

Devin Gardner and then-

sophomore Shane Morris were 
firmly entrenched as the team’s 
top two quarterbacks for the 
2014 season under Brady Hoke.

But then, after the 2014 

season, Hoke’s firing and Jim 
Harbaugh’s hiring shook things 
up at the position. Harbaugh 
declared 
the 
quarterback 

job would be won in an open 
competition. 
Speight, 
like 

everyone else, had a shot.

Things did not go according to 

plan. Speight, after his redshirt 
season, was injured during the 
spring and did not appear in the 
Wolverines’ Spring Game. Then, 
when summer rolled around, 
Jake Rudock arrived as a transfer 
student. The competition carried 
on, but Rudock and Morris were 
the leaders the entire way.

Speight noticed and took it as 

a little bit of a slight. He lived 
with junior tight end Jake Butt 
and redshirt freshman wide 
receiver Drake Harris over the 
summer, and they sometimes 
discussed the team’s quarterback 
competition. 
Speight, 
with 

starting aspirations, was not 
enthralled by the idea of being an 

afterthought, but he attempted 
to use it to his advantage.

“Sometimes it’s good not to 

be talked about,” Butt said. “You 
can just sneak in behind the 
scenes and just keep working 
hard, and that’s what Wilton 
did. He made 
it a point that 
he wanted to 
get his name 
out there.”

So 
when 

Speight 
received 
his 

opportunity 
Saturday 
night, with his 
team trailing 
in the third quarter at Minnesota 
and the Little Brown Jug on the 
line, it was natural that Butt — 

who considers Speight a close 
friend — wanted to help his 
quarterback calm down. He went 
over to Speight when Rudock 
went down and gave the backup 
some encouraging words. He 
was planning to do the same 

after Speight’s 
first 
three 

passes fell to 
the 
ground, 

incomplete.

But then he 

realized 
he 

didn’t need to. 
He 
saw 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
whacking 
Speight on the 

sidelines to amp him up and 
simulate the sensation of being 
hit. He figured Harbaugh had 

it under control. The coach was 
not hitting Speight lightly.

“Booom, boom, banging on 

his pads, smacking him in the 
chest, smacking him in the 
helmet,” Butt said, pantomiming 
smacking motions. “I guess after 
that, you’ve got to be ready to go.”

And Speight was. His first 

pass on Michigan’s final drive 
was a completion to Butt. The 
inexperienced quarterback kept 
the momentum going, despite 
the inconvenience of leading his 
team into Minnesota’s howling 
student section. He completed 
two more passes to score the 
game-winning touchdown, and 
then another on the ensuing 
two-point conversion to give 
Michigan a three-point cushion.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Redshirt freshman quarterback Wilton Speight drew high praise from his teammates for the comeback he led Saturday.

For Nieves, a lonely 
road back to practice

Senior returns 

to practice 

after sustaining 

concussion Oct. 24

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

Boo Nieves was in decidedly 

high spirits on Monday, flashing 
a smile as he left the ice and 
unstrapped his helmet.

Heading into the final game 

of the New York trip in October, 
Nieves was off to one of the 
hottest starts of his four-year 
career at Michigan. The senior 
forward had two points in three 
games and was tremendous at 
both ends while centering the 
Wolverines’ top-scoring line.

All that momentum came 

to a screeching halt with a 
concussion 
Nieves 
sustained 

in a win against Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute on Oct. 
24. Nieves didn’t practice for 
the rest of the week and was 
relegated to the bench for a 
home series against Robert 
Morris the following weekend.

Junior forward Justin Selman 

and freshman forward Kyle 
Connor missed the presence of 
their center against the Colonials; 
the pair of wings tallied only one 
point on the weekend.

“We were rotating the third 

guy in, which is always a little 
bit of a challenge — trying to find 
the chemistry each shift with 
a different guy,” Selman said. 
“Boo brings a ton of speed to the 
game, he brings a ton of puck 
possession and he’s a big body 
out there. It’s going to be good to 
have him back.”

The time away wasn’t easy 

on Nieves, either. The mental 

exhaustion that can accompany 
concussions is well documented.

“It’s very frustrating,” Nieves 

said. “Even in practice, it’s 
tough sitting there watching 
them do what you want to do. 
I think the best way to stay 
with it is watching practice and 
being around the guys. I wasn’t 
around them for the first two 
days last week, and I started to 
feel a little out of the loop.”

Once his symptoms started 

to dissipate, Nieves was glad 
to hang around the team more, 
saying it made him feel better 
about being left out of the 
lineup. He returned to practice 
Monday, confirming that he 
didn’t have any symptoms on or 
off the ice.

Now 
appearing 
outgoing 

with a disarming smile, the 
lonely center doing homework 
at practice last week seems like 
a distant memory. Nieves is 
just happy to be talking hockey, 
giving his take on Saturday’s 
loss.

“The 
second 
game 
was 

tough,” Nieves said. “We did 
look a little sluggish out of the 
gate, but it’s going to happen. 
We just couldn’t find a way back.

“It’s also easy to sit out and 

watch from above and critique 
everything.”

There is still progress to be 

made before Nieves can start 
taking contact in practice, and 
concussions have a nasty habit 
of recurring in hockey. With a 
two-week break, though, both 
Nieves and Michigan coach Red 
Berenson seem confident that 
the center will make it back for 
a home game against Niagara on 
Nov. 13.

For now, Nieves is content 

just to be back on the ice.

“Practice was the best part of 

my day, easily,” Nieves said.

Jabrill Peppers, standout and tiger

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Jabrill Peppers is many things. 

For starters, he’s a triple threat, a 
player who changes the game in 
all phases. He’s also the Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week, an honor 
he earned for the second time this 
season Monday after totaling 100 
all-purpose yards and breaking up 
two passes against Minnesota.

Monday, Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh talked about the ways 
Peppers is special — a term that’s 
nearly impossible to measure — 
and no one batted an eye. But the 
redshirt freshman didn’t need 
Harbaugh to say he was special. 
His play has spoken for itself all 
season long.

Peppers is a safety, a cornerback, 

a nickelback, a punt returner, a 
kick returner, a running back, a 
wide receiver and, on occasion, a 
quarterback. Sometimes, he’s all 
of those in one game.

But 
redshirt 
junior 
Erik 

Magnuson has another way to 
think of him.

“Have you ever seen the Netflix 

documentary, ‘The Tiger and the 

Monk?’ ” Magnuson asked a group 
of reporters Monday. “It’s about 
this monk who lives in the jungle 
in Thailand that has 16 tigers. I 
think Jabrill would be a tiger.”

Strictly speaking, you don’t 

need to see the documentary to 
get the comparison.

“It just gives you a better idea 

of how cool tigers are,” Magnuson 
said. “They’re very, very, very 
peaceful. 
Accept 
their 
inner 

peace. 
But 

when it’s time 
to attack, they 
strike.”

For Peppers, 

that 
fits 

quite 
well. 

His 
normal 

position, safety, 
requires a great 
deal of flexibility. Sometimes he 
lines up over the top, sometimes 
in 
man 
coverage. 
But 
like 

Magnuson’s tiger analogy, he also 
knows when to attack, whether 
it’s blitzing or going back to return 
a punt or kick.

Against Minnesota, he flipped 

the field twice, returning a punt 
for 41 yards and a kickoff for 43, 

setting up a pair of touchdown 
drives for the Michigan offense. 
On one of the drives, Peppers 
scored his first touchdown of the 
season, a six-yard run on which 
he lined up as a quarterback in the 
wildcat formation. It was part of 
a recent swing that has seen him 
taking more offensive reps.

Working 
Peppers 
into 
the 

offense was hardly a surprise 
development — fans and media 

alike wondered 
how 
long 

it 
would 
be 

until they saw 
Peppers 
on 

offense, 
and 

even 
junior 

tight end Jake 
Butt admitted 
to 
wondering 

when the Wolverines would use 
him there.

But as far as getting him 

acclimated, Peppers has had to 
make use of limited practice reps 
with the offense.

“Since we only have him for a 

little bit, we’ll run through all of 
the plays that we have with him 
like, 
back-to-back-to-back-to-

back,” Butt said. “And some of the 
plays he’ll be coming back like, 
hands on the hips, and coach will 
just tell him, ‘All right, you only 
need to go like five yards on this 
play,’ you know? Try to save his 
energy a little bit.”

Still, having him run those 

plays while worn out is good 
practice. Peppers was on the 
field for more than 90 plays 
against the Golden Gophers, 
which makes his numbers even 
more impressive.

“He’s just a … man, it’s hard 

to describe,” Butt said. “He’s got 
something that you can’t coach.”

But for as large an impact as 

he makes on the game, and the 
larger-than-life personality he 
portrays, 
Peppers’ 
teammates 

say it’s not an around-the-clock 
energy.

Jabrill Peppers might, in fact, 

have an off switch.

“He’s kind of a quiet guy around 

the locker room sometimes,” Butt 
said. “But when he’s on the field, 
that juice is flowing, for sure.”

Quiet until it’s time to attack? 

Maybe Magnuson was on to 
something, after all.

Redshirt freshman safety Jabrill Peppers has played eight different positions this year, making an impact on offense, defense and special teams.

“He’s got 

something you 
can’t coach.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ opens practice 
to fans for an hour

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Usually, before the season 

starts, the curtain is closed at 
Crisler Arena. Michigan men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein 
doesn’t like to 
allow too many 
looks 
at 
his 

team before it starts facing other 
competition. But on Monday 
night, the Wolverines made an 
exception: The team hosted an 
open practice for fans followed 
by a chance to take selfies with 
players and Beilein.

The open session ran for only 

an hour, but it provided a sneak 
peek at the Wolverines before 
they tip off against Le Moyne in 
an exhibition contest on Friday. 
With the regular season less 
than two weeks away, the Daily 
offers a few takeaways from the 
open practice.

MO 
WEEZY, 
MO 

STREAKY: Moritz Wagner, or 
“Mo Weezy” as some teammates 
like to call him, is six feet, 10 
inches of potential. The squad’s 
only 
scholarship 
freshman 

showed flashes of greatness 
Monday night amid moments of 
raw play. In a 5-on-5 scrimmage 
at the end of practice, the Berlin 
product stole the ball, drove, 
spun and finished over D.J. 
Wilson’s outstretched arm.

“He’s 6-feet-10 and a half, and 

he’s only 18,” Beilein told the 
crowd after. “He still could be in 
high school.”

A few minutes later, Wagner 

picked up another steal and 
finished 
with 
a 
big 
dunk 

followed by a fist pump, and he 
followed it with a 3-pointer a 
few possessions later. But his 
moments of “wow” were mixed 
in with freshman moments, too, 
and it’s easy to see why Beilein 
says he’s still a work in progress. 
Early in the practice, he missed 
an assignment on defense. On 
the offensive side, he still doesn’t 
always look comfortable with 
the ball in his hands, sometimes 
picking up his dribble before 

he knows what he’s going to do 
with the ball.

In his best moments, Wagner 

looks like a poor man’s Dirk 
Nowitzki — a comparison his 
former coach in Berlin made 
— but as of now, there are still 
more times when he looks like a 
lost freshman just trying to get 
the fundamentals down.

GO D.J., THAT’S MY D.J.: 

A year after D.J. Wilson took a 
medical redshirt due to a knee 
injury, the redshirt freshman 
looks a lot stronger and more 
comfortable on the court. On 
Monday night, he showed why 
he’ll be a key piece for Beilein 
this season.

Wilson looked at ease with 

the ball in his hands at the top 
of the key and used quick passes 
to help facilitate his team’s 
offense. He was stronger down 
low, confidently posting up on 
offense and boxing his man out 
on defense. He also didn’t shy 
away from shooting from the 
perimeter, knocking down a 
handful of 3s over the course of 
the night.

At 6-foot-10 and up to 240 

pounds after weighing just 215 
a year ago, Wilson could be 
opponents’ biggest challenge with 
his dual inside-outside ability.

DAWKINS 
LEAVES: 

In a full court 3-on-3 drill, 
sophomore 
Aubrey 
Dawkins 

landed on sophomore forward 
Kameron Chatman’s foot after 
coming down from an alley-oop 
dunk. 
Dawkins 
immediately 

hit the ground and reached for 
his right ankle, grimacing in 
pain. He limped to the sideline, 
where he walked around for a 
few minutes, still appearing to 
be hurt. He returned to drills 
soon after, but eventually left 
the practice early to go to the 
locker room.

Dawkins did come out to take 

pictures with fans afterwards, 
indicating that he was OK and 
had just landed on his foot 
awkwardly. He was still favoring 
his left leg more than an hour 
after practice.

“He made it a 
point that he 

wanted to get his 
name out there.”

NOTEBOOK


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
8 — Tuesday, November 3, 2015

Speight’s task has not been a 

simple one. His first meaningful 
passes as a college quarterback 
were game-deciding ones. Morris, 
the man many assumed to be 
Michigan’s backup quarterback, 
remained 
on 

the 
sideline 

after Rudock’s 
injury, 
his 

redshirt 
preserved 
according 
to 

plan.

Even 

Harbaugh, 
known 
as 

“Captain 
Comeback” 
during 
his 
NFL 

playing career, was not sure 
Monday if he had ever been put 
in the situation of leading his 
team to victory after he came 
off the bench. After a moment 
of consideration, the former 
quarterback acknowledged that 
he had experienced success in 
the department.

“Well … I’ve had some good 

ones, 
I 
guess,” 
Harbaugh 

deadpanned.

After Speight came through 

with his own comeback, his 
teammates 
showed 
their 

appreciation. They appeared to 
be personally proud of Speight. 
Some of them affectionately call 
him “Wilt the Stilt” as a play on 

his first name.

Fifth-

year 
senior 

Desmond 
Morgan sought 
out Speight for 
a 
postgame 

hug. 
Morris 

lauded Speight 
on Twitter. At 
the end of their 
joint postgame 

press conference Saturday night, 
redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers smiled and yelled, “Wilt 
the Stilt, baby!” toward Speight. 
Redshirt junior wide receiver 
Jehu Chesson, the recipient of 
the game-winning pass, made it 
a point to commend Speight for 
his efforts Monday.

The 
recognition 
was 
his 

reward 
for 
commanding 

Michigan’s huddle, one filled 
with older players, with poise.

“He’s 
respected,” 
said 

redshirt 
junior 
offensive 

lineman 
Erik 
Magnuson. 

“We don’t have any doubts on 
our backup players, backup 
quarterbacks. So when he came 
in there, it wasn’t like, ‘Oh no, 
we’ve got to step our game up 
because we’ve got Wilton in.’ It 
was just like, ‘Let’s get going. 
Let’s do what we’ve got to do.’ ”

The 
possibility 
remains 

that Speight could get another 
chance 
Saturday 
against 

Rutgers. Rudock’s status is still 
in doubt. Harbaugh said the plan 
was to see how much Rudock 
could participate in practice 
Monday, but the starter would be 
determined by who would give 
the team the best chance to win. 
If Rudock is healthy, that will 
likely be him.

But at the very least, Speight 

will always have Saturday night, 
when he came off the bench as 
an unknown to deliver his team 
a trophy. He is an afterthought 
no more.
