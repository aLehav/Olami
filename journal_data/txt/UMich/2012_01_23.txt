After death of
relative, surgeon
takes to the streets
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
Amid ongoing violence in
Syria, Mohammad Arabi, a radi-
ologist at the University Hos-

pital, protested yesterday in
honor of his deceased relative,
an orthopedic surgeon who was
killed during his efforts to aid
wounded protesters in Syria.
"They kept chasing him, chas-
ing him until they killed him,"
Arabi said.
Arabi, joined by more than
20 local doctors from the Syr-
ian community, gathered yester-
day at the corner of South State

Street and North University
Avenue to protest the continuing
violence against medical person-
nel in Syria who have been aiding
protesters harmed for rallying
for the forced resignation of Syr-
ian President Bashar al-Assad.
"We have our relatives there,
we have our families there and
we are very concerned about our
colleagues, doctors and nurses
who are working under very

bad, distressing circumstances,"
Arabi said.
Since the protests began last
March, Syrian police and mili-
tary continue to attack protesters
with tanks, snipers and tear gas
at various rallies in an attempt to
silence the opposition, accord-
ing to reports from Al Jazeera, a

Changes to Title

By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
For officials in the University's
Office of Financial Aid, the legal

challenges associated with han-
dling federal grant money have
become increasingly burden-
some in recent years.
Enforcing regulations under
a Title IV loan - a government
loan subject to federal rules and
proration standards, which dic-
tate that students may not receive
their full amount of federal aid if
they do not attend an institution
for the entire academic year -
are particularly cumbersome

for the University, according to
Pamela Fowler, executive direc-
tor of the University's Office of
Financial Aid.
The University, along with a
number of other schools around
the country, acted as an experi-
mental site for the efficiency of
the regulation, meaning that
since 1992, the University has
not been subject to the regula-
tion, according to Fowler. The

Cancer patients may have new
medicinal marijuana treatment

Cannabis-based plant itself could soon be making
their way to pharmacy shelves,
mouth spray is in according to drug companies,
small biotech firms and univer-
development sity scientists.
A British company, GW
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Pharma, is in advanced clinical
quarter-century after the U.S. trials for the world's first phar-
Food and Drug Administration maceutical developed from raw
approved the first prescription marijuana instead of synthetic
drugs based on the main psycho- equivalents- a mouth spray it
active ingredient in marijuana, hopes to market in the U.S. as a
additional medicines derived treatment for cancer pain. And it
from or inspired by the cannabis hopes to see FDA approval by the

end of 2013.
Sativex contains marijuana's
two best known components -
delta 9-THC and cannabidiol -
and already has been approved
in Canada, New Zealand and
eight European countries for a
different usage, relieving muscle
spasms associated with multiple
sclerosis.
FDA approval would represent
an important milestone in the
nation's often uneasy relation-
ship with marijuana, which 16
states and the District of Colum-
bia already allow residents to
use legally with doctors' rec-
ommendations. The U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration
categorizes pot as a dangerous
drug with no medical value,
but the availability of a chemi-
cally similar prescription drug
could increase pressure on the
federal government to revisit
its position and encourage other
drug companies to follow in GW
Pharma's footsteps.
"There is a real disconnect
between what the public seems
to be demanding and what the
states have pushed for and
what the market is providing,"
said Aron Lichtman, a Virginia
Commonwealth University
pharmacology professor and
president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society.
"It seems to me a company with
a great deal of vision would say,
'If there is this demand and
need, we could develop a drug
that will help people and we
will make a lot of money."'
Possessing marijuana still is
illegal in the United Kingdom,
but about a decade ago GW
Pharma's founder, Dr. Geoffrey
Guy, received permission to
grow it to develop a prescrip-
tion drug.

Ahuja said. "Through my job,
I have an opportunity to learn
about all these communities that
I would never have the opportu-
nity to do."
Engineering senior Prithvi
Murthy, co-chair of the confer-
ence, said the event's central
planning team achieved its goal
to raise awareness about issues
relevant to the South Asian com-
munity locally and abroad.
"What we aimed to achieve
with this awareness was to show
how easily social justice initia-
tives could be incorporated into
every individual's life," Murthy
said. "We hoped that partici-
pants could establish the con-
sistency and continuity of these
injustices across communities
and regions and that anyone can
be inspired to make them per-
sonal causes."
The program also includ-
ed eight different workshops
focused on promoting social
change through arts, academ-

ics and activism. U.S. Rep. Han-
sen Clarke (D-Mich.), a South
Asian raised in Detroit, also
spoke of his experience growing
up with a Bangladeshi Muslim
immigrant father and a Black
Christian mother in inner-city
Detroit.
Prerna Lal, an LGBTQ Fiji-
Indian activist who is an undoc-
umented resident living in the
United States, hosted a work-
shop encouraging South Asian
youth to voice their concerns
about the U.S. immigration sys-
tem.
LSA sophomore Guneet Ahlu-
walia said the small group dis-
cussions during the workshop
provided him with new perspec-
tives on controversial topicsthat
are usually avoided.
"I really opened up myself
to the group during the small
group," Ahluwalia said. "I was
thinking about stuff I usu-
ally wouldn't think about, and
because of that I was able to look
at the issues differently."
LSA senior Sian Dowis

attended a workshop on sexual
health on Saturday and said
workshop leader Sapna Mysoor,
a program manager at the Asian
& Pacific Islander Wellness Cen-
ter, made her realize how differ-
ent learning about sexuality was
for her as a Caucasian compared
those in the South Asian com-
munity.
"I think the workshop was
really eye-opening," Dowis said.
"When they asked who learned
about sex from their parents,
I was one of the very few who
raised their hands."
At Saturday's conference,
Engineering junior Evan Pot-
ter said he became more aware
of the issues affecting South
Asians in the United States and
abroad.
"In South Asia, the issues are
more about healthcare and edu-
cation in rural areas," Potter
said. "However, in the United
States, it's more about racial
profiling and negative stereo-
types associated with the South
Asians livinghere."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Two dozen hearses
lead anti-violence
parade through city
About two dozen hearses led
a motorcade yesterday through
Detroit as part of a campaign to
call attention to killings in the
city.
The United Communities of
America organized the "Thou
Shall Not Kill" motorcade, with a
course from downtown through
several crime-ridden neighbor-
s hoods before ending with a rally
at Fellowship Chapel.
"God does speak," Pastor Ovel-
la Andreas, an organizer, told the
crowd. "And I pray today that
those who have ears will hear
what He is saying."
The Detroit Free Press report-
ed that the funeral home hearses
were followed for blocks by cars,
trucks and vans. Police cars with
their sirens blaring escorted the
procession.
LOS ANGELES
Severed body
parts found near
Hollywood sign
Authorities have determined
that a dismembered head and
other body parts found in a rug-
ged hillside park near the famed
. "Hollywood" sign are the remains
of a man who lived in an a nearby
apartment.
The victim was Hervey Medel-
lin, a 66-year-old from Los Ange-
les, coroner's Lt. David Smith said
Friday night.
Investigators, who are search-
ing for suspects, served a search
warrant on a Hollywood apart-
ment in the area a day earlier, but
it wasn't immediately clear if it
was Medellin's apartment.
"We don't want to give out too
much information because the
investigation is ongoing," Andrew
Smith said.
MANILA, Phillipines
All 32 passengers
aboard ships saved
after sinking
A cargo ship loaded with
cement sank in the central Philip-
pines yesterday and another ves-
sel carrying iron ore went down
off the country's eastern coast, the
coast guard said. All 32 crewmen
from both ships were rescued.
The ship carrying iron ore, the
Panamanian-registered M/V Sun
Spirit, began to list Saturday off
Catanduanes province and sent a
distress signal.
Though coast guard officials
immediately deployed three ships
and a helicopter for a search and
rescue, it was a Philippine cargo
* ship and a fishing boat that saved
the crew of 12 Indonesians and
two Koreans, who had abandoned
the ship, coastguard Adm. Ramon

Liwag said.
SANAA, Yemen
Yemeni president
leaves for U.S. due
to health problems
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh left his battered nation yes-
terday on his way to the U.S. for
medical treatment after passing
power to his deputy and asking
for forgiveness for any "shortcom-
ings" during his 33-year rein.
But in a sign that Saleh's role as
Yemen's top power broker is likely
far from over, he said he would
return to Yemen before the offi-
cial power transfer next month
to serve as the head of his ruling
party.
Saleh's departure marks a small
achievement in the months of dip-
lomatic efforts by the U.S. and
Yemen's powerful Gulf neighbors
to ease the nearly year-old politi-
cal crisis in the Arab world's poor-
est country. An active al-Qaida
branch there has taken advantage
of the turmoil, stepping up opera-
tions and seizing territory.

U.S. top officials talk
to Afghan insurgents'

SUNDAY ALAMBA/AP
Soldiers stand guard at a major road junction prior to Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan's visit to the site of a suicide
bombing at the police headquarters in Kano, Nigeria yesterday.
More than 150 people killed in
attack in northern Nigerian city

Discussions hope
to speed up peace
moves
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Anx-
ious to accelerate peace moves,
top-level U.S. officials have held
talks with a representative of
an insurgent movement led by a
former Afghan prime minister
who has been branded a terrorist
by Washington, a relative of the
rebel leader says.
Dr. Ghairat Baheer, a represen-
tative and son-in-law of longtime
Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hek-
matyar, told The Associated Press
this week that he had met sepa-
rately with David Petraeus, for-
mer commander of NATO forces
in Afghanistan who is now CIA
director, and had face-to-face dis-
cussions earlier this month with
U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker
and U.S. Marine Gen. John Allen,
currently the top commander in
the country.
Baheer, who was released
in 2008 after six years in U.S.
detention at Bagram Air Field in
Afghanistan, described his talks
with U.S. officials as nascent and
exploratory. Yet, Baheer says the
discussions show that the U.S.
knows that in addition to get-
ting the blessing of Taliban chief
Mullah Mohammad Omar - a
bitter rival of Hekmatyar even
though both are fighting inter-

national troops - any peace deal
would have to be supported by
Hekmatyar, who has thousands
of fighters and followers primar-
ily in the north and east.
Hizb-i-Islami, which means
Islamic party, has had ties to
al-Qaida but in 2010 floated a
15-point peace plan during infor-
mal meetings with the Afghan
government in Kabul. At the time,
however, U.S. officials refused to
see the party's delegation.
"Hizb-i-Islami is a reality that
no one can ignore," Baheer said
during an interview last week at
his spacious home in a posh sub-
urb of Pakistan's capital, Islam-
abad. "For a while, the United
States and the Kabul government
tried not to give so much impor-
tance to Hizb-i-Islami, but now
they have come to the conclusion
that they cannot make it without
Hizb-i-Islami."
In Washington, National
Security Council spokeswoman
Caitlin Hayden would not con-
firm that such meetings took
place but said the U.S. was main-
taining "a range of contacts in
support of an Afghan-led recon-
ciliation process."
AU.S. official, speakingon con-
dition of anonymityto discuss the
high-level meetings, said Petrae-
us last met with Baheer in July
2011 when he was still command-
ing NATO forces in Afghanistan.
Petraeus took over as CIA direc-
tor in September.

Stench of death
permeates Kano as
hospitals overflow
with patients
KANO, Nigeria (AP) - People
in this north Nigeria city once
wore surgical masks to block the
dust swirling through its sprawl-
ing neighborhoods, but swarm-
ing children hawked the masks
for pennies apiece yesterday to
block the stench of death at a hos-
pital overflowing with the dead
following a coordinated attack
by a radical Islamist sect.
The Nigerian Red Cross now
estimates more than 150 people
died in Friday's attack in Kano,
which saw at least two suicide
bombers from the sect known
as Boko Haram detonate explo-
sive-laden cars. The scope of
the attack, apparently planned
to free sect members held by
authorities here, left even Presi-
dent Goodluck Jonathan speech-
less as he toured what remained
of a regional police headquarters
yesterday.
"The federal government will
not rest until we arrest the per-
petrators of this act," Jonathan
said earlier. "They are not spirits,
they are not ghosts."
However, unrest continued
across Nigeria as unknown
assailants in the northern state
of Bauchi killed at least 11 people
overnight Saturday in attacks
that saw at least two churches
bombed, a sign how far insecu-
rity has penetrated Africa's most
populous nation.
Friday's attacks by Boko
Haram hit police stations, immi-
gration offices and the local head-

quarters of Nigeria's secret police
in Kano, a city of more than 9
million people that remains an
important political and religious
center in the country's Muslim
north. The assault left corpses
lying in the streets across the city,
many wearing police or other
security agency uniforms.
Yesterday, soldiers wearing
bulky bulletproof vests stood
guard at intersections and
roundabouts, with bayoneted
Kalashnikov rifles at the ready.
Some made those disobeying
traffic directions do sit-ups or in
one case, repeatedly raise a bicy-
cle over their head.
Signs of the carnage still
remained. Police officers wear-
ing surgical masks escorted
a corpse wrapped in a white
burial shroud out of Murtala
Muhammed Specialist Hospital,
the city's biggest. Hospital offi-
cials there declined to comment
yesterday, but the smell of the
overflowing mortuary hung in
the air.
An internal Red Cross report
seen yesterday by an Associated
Press reporter said that hospital
alone has accepted more than
150 dead bodies from the attacks.
That death toll could rise further
as officials continue to collect
bodies.
At least four foreigners were
wounded in the attack, the
report showed. Among the dead
was Indian citizen Kevalkumar
Rajput, 23, the Press Trust of
India news agency reported.
Jonathan arrived to the city
late yesterday afternoon, trav-
eling quickly by a motorcade to
meet with the state governor and
the Emir of Kano, an important
Islamic figure in the country. His
motorcade later rushed to what

used to be the regional command
headquarters for the Nigeria
police, with an armed personnel
carrier trailing behind, a soldier
manning the heavy machine gun
atop it.
The Christian president,
wearing a Muslim prayer cap and
a black kaftan, looked stunned as
he stood near where the suicide
car bomber detonated his explo-
sives. Officers there said guards
on duty shot the tires of the
speeding car, forcing it to stop
before it reached the lobby of the
headquarters.
However, it didn't matter in
the end as the powerful explo-
sives in the car shredded the
cement building, tore away its
roof and blew out its windows.
Blood stained the yellow paint
near a second-story window, just
underneath a 10-foot-tall tree
uprooted and tossed atop the
building by the blast.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon also condemned the
multiple attacks yesterday.
"The secretary-general is
appalled at the frequency and
intensity of recent attacks in
Nigeria, which demonstrate a
wanton and unacceptable disre-
gard for human life," a statement
from his office read. He also
expressed "his hope for swift
and transparent investigations
into these incidents that lead to
bringing the perpetrators to jus-
tice."
A Boko Haram spokesman
using the nom de guerre Abul-
Qaqa claimed responsibility for
the attacks in a message to jour-
nalists Friday. He said the attack
came because the state govern-
ment refused to release Boko
Haram members held by the
police.

State legislators break
law with no punishment

Arizona bill would
grant law makers
immunity
PHOENIX (AP) - An Ari-
zona senator gets in a fight
with his girlfriend on a Phoe-
nix freeway and avoids arrest.
An Arkansas legislator leads
officers on a high-speed chase
through two counties and
doesn't get taken into custody.
A Georgia lawmaker claims
he couldn't be prosecuted on a
DUI charge.
In each case, a little-known
privilege called legislative
immunity that prevents the
arrests of legislators while they
are in session came into play.
The issue is getting a closer
look in Arizona this year after a
lawmaker introduced a resolu-
tion seeking to amend the state
Constitution to delete wording
barring the arrest of legisla-

tors during, and 15 days before,
legislative sessions. Like those
in many other states, Arizona's
legislative immunity protects
legislators from arrest except for
"treason, felony or breach of the
peace."
Then-Sen. Scott Bundgaard
became a part of the debate
after he was involved in a
domestic violence incident on
a Phoenix freeway last year. He
and his girlfriend at the time
pulled off to the side of the
road after an argument while
returning home from a Danc-
ing with the Stars-type compe-
tition. The ensuring fight left
both with cuts and bruises.
Police showed up and put
Bundgaard in handcuffs. Offi-
cers testified that he identified
himself as a legislator, cited the
constitutional provision and
demanded that they remove
handcuffs, even though Bund-
gaard denies invoking legisla-
tive immunity.

Employees, not students
'U', GSRAs and GEO must have civil dialogue
The unending battle between the graduate student research
assistants and the University continues to grow in drama and
complexity. The GSRAs are fighting for their right to union-
ize and the University's Board of Regents, in a party-line decision,
voted to give the GSRAs the right to vote to determine if they could
unionize. Key administrators - including University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Provost Philip Hanlon and deans from every school and
college - have publicly said they believe GSRAs aren't employees and
shouldn't be able to organize. Growing frustration has led the GSRAs
to become more active in their protests, but the battle has moved to
state courts. The University needs to engage GSRAs in a civil debate
to ensure a fair resolution to this matter.

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITORI
Learning from

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
r mistake

This newspaper often makes
mistakes. How's that for an
uncontroversial opener?
Producing a daily newspaper is
generally an intense, deadline-driv-
en endeavor where errors are bound
tooccur; newspaperswouldn'tboth-
er with a corrections section if the
problem could somehow be cured.
However, at a student publication
such as The Michigan Daily, where
everyone is always learning to be
better, and those that get better are
probably about readyto depart, mis-
takes are even more common.
Rarely though, do such mistakes
rise to a level demanding an apol-
ogy and explanation from the editor
in chief, as appeared on page 2A of
the Jan. 9 edition of this paper. The
issue addressed in that editor's note
was a columnist's failure to properly
attribute borrowed ideas, and edi-
tors' failure to catch a fairly obvious
instance of insufficient attribution.
Failure to properly attribute being
about the biggestsinthere is in jour-
nalism and academia, the issue cer-
tainly deserved all the attention it
got from the Daily's top editor.
Plagiarism scandals are nothing
new for college newspapers, and for
the Daily specifically. Thankfully,
the specific violation addressed in
the Jan. 9 editor's note was not near-
ly as egregious as most others. In my
nearly seven years as a staff writer
for this paper, I observed the fallout
from several very serious incidents
of plagiarism. I learned that two
paramount issues arise from such
situations, and both must be dealt
with very delicately by management
desk - the group of senior editors
that governs the Daily.
First, there is the human ele-
ment of such incidents. All editors
on the Daily's management desk

mean well, but as young college
students, they probably have little
or no experience being in a serious
management position, where their
decisions are critical to someone's
future and to the continued sur-
vival of this paper. The challenge
they face is responding strongly to
negate the violation while main-
taining perspective and treating
fairly the violator, who is, after
all, just another young person who
made a mistake.
Second is the institutional ele-
ment. With every major mistake
this paper makes and has to rec-
tify, its reputation takes a slight hit.
Over time, people forget, but in the
present, years of good reporting
by a newspaper can be tarnished
by just one serious incident of pla-
giarism. Though the incident of
improper attribution that inspired
this column was not fatal in itself, it
is nonetheless a hit that this paper
took. In the aftermath of such a dif-
ficult situation, editors are charged
with rectifying and resuscitating
the paper's reputation by ensuring
that proper procedures are in place
to protect against a recurrence of
similar violations.
The Daily's current editors have
already passed the first test by
dealing superbly with the personal
aspect of this incident. The editor
in chief and management desk's
response was quick, measured
and cognizant of the broader issue
involved. While the writer who
made the mistake must shoulder
much of the blame, the editor's note
rightly recognized an institutional
failure in this instance. Even though
the writer included the title of the
column from which he drew inspi-
ration, none of the several editors
responsible for content on the edi-


torial page read the source column.
Had they done so, the similarities of
wording would have become obvi-
ous, and the incident would have
been avoided.
I hope that the mere fact that they
recognized an institutional failure
in this case is a sign that the Daily's
leadership is poised to deal thor-
oughly with the broad institutional
element involved in such incidents.
Previously, editors have promised
sweeping reforms in the embar-
rassing aftermath of such incidents,
but those reforms faded out quickly.
Those failures in the past to engrain
proper reforms into the core of this
newspaper - failures that my own
generation of editors must share
the blame for - are the reason there
remained a lack of awareness and
vigilance about plagiarism in the
current generation of Daily writers
and editors.
I hope this minor incident will
be enough of a wake-up call to
the Daily to revitalize plagiarism
checks and ensure full understand-
ing of the issue among all writers. If
that is done, and the steps taken are
memorialized for all future classes
of writers and editors, then this
current class of editors will have
accomplished something several
past classes failed to do. And with
that success, incidents like the one
that necessitated this column can
become one less mistake that this
paper has to worry about.

The Michigan Employment Relations Com-
mission turned over the debate to courts in
December, where a state judge will rule on
GSRAs' employment status. A decision is
expected next month.
On Aug. 30, Jennifer Dibbern, a GSRA in
the Department of Materials Science and
Engineering, was allegedly fired due to her
involvement with the Graduate Employees'
Organization. The University claims its deci-
sion was purely academic and not in retaliation
to Dibbern's activism, even though evidence
from a University e-mail seems to say other-
wise. It's unclear what exactly happened, but
loud voices aren't making it easy to understand
the matter.
It's unfortunate that University adminis-
trators have taken such drastic measures to
clamp down on the protests. University admin-
istrators say these students shouldn't union-
ize because they don't consider them public
employees or their research to be a legitimate
job. According to Dibbern's account of the
situation, her professors were content with
her performance at the University as a GSRA
until her involvement as the treasurer of GEO
became apparent.
GSRAs are student researchers who earn
money by assisting a professor, who is their
mentor, in research. Being a GSRA is not

a mandatory prerequisite for a graduate
degree. Many GSRAs take on the research
positions to gain experience and some uti-
lize their wage to help fund their education.
The GSRAs earn money for their services as
research assistants to professors and there-
fore are University employees.
Though University administrators argue
that GSRAs are merely students and research
is simply a step in their education, the fact
that they are accepting pay for their work
legitimizes their employment status. They
could be fired for poor performance, and they
have to pay taxes for what they earn. If there
were no students who volunteered to do the
job, the University would hire others, most
likely non-students, to do the same work. The
GSRAs are employees and deserve the right
to unionize.
All employees have the right to collective
bargaining. The GSRAs should have the right
as active employees of the University to push
for the benefits of a union. The University
administrators' unwillingness to talk has led
to annoyance on the part of the GSRAs. This
matter can't be solved without proper dialogue.
Administrators need to realize that it can no
longer slide this pressing issue under the rug,
and acknowledge the need for and importance
of collective bargaining power for GSRAs.

DANIEL
CHARDELL

While the University has sought to cultivate
a diverse, welcoming student body, the enroll-
ment of in-state students and underrepre-
sented minorities has fallen in recent years. To
demonstrate its commitment to the reversal of
this trend, the University must end its policy of
charging higher tuition to undocumented stu-
dents. Though qualified undocumented immi-
grants graduate from Michigan high schools
every year, they are required to pay out-of-
state tuition, and thus pay more than $25,000
extra per year in tuition than their fellow class-
mates in Michigan. Tomorrow, the Central
Student Government will vote on a resolution
that could potentially improve undocumented
students' access to the University of Michigan.
The Undergraduate Chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union at the University, along
with the newly formed Coalition for Tuition
Equality, urges CSG to approve this resolution.
Undocumented students from foreign coun-
tries have either entered the country without
authorization, or had authorization but stayed
past its expiration. They typically move to
the U.S. with family members at a young age,
so they do not make the choice to immigrate.
There are an estimated 21,000 undocumented
youth who call Michigan home.
Like U.S. citizens and permanent residents,
undocumented immigrants pay Michigan
income and sales taxes, which help fund this
University. However, undocumented students
are denied in-state tuition despite their aca-
demic achievements and their parents' sub-
stantial contributions to the state of Michigan
and its communities.
Undocumented students are guaranteed a
public K-12 education, but upon graduation,
they are barred from receiving federal finan-
cial aid. In-state tuition, at $12,634 per year
for freshmen and sophomores, is burdensome
for most Michigan families, but out-of-state
tuition, at $37,782 per year, is more than the
typical annual income of undocumented fami-
lies. The sum of out-of-state tuition and living
expenses, combined with a lack of financial aid
and access to student loans, prevents undocu-
mentedstudents from attending, or even apply-
ing to, the University of Michigan.
The lack of higher education options for
Michigan's undocumented youth threatens
their social and economic mobility. Recogniz-
ing this injustice, concerned student organiza-
tions, including the University's chapter of the

College Democrats, the ACLU, Migrant and
Immigrant Rights Advocacy, Human Rights
Through Education, and the Peace and Jus-
tice Commission banded together to form the
Coalition for Tuition Equality. The Coalition
defined tuition equality as in-state tuition to
undocumented students and for improvements
in affordability of tuition for all students -
especially those who are undocumented. The
Coalition for Tuition Equality believes that
access to higher education should be a right, as
is K-12 education, and not a privilege.
While public universities are barred under
federal law from providing in-state tuition
to undocumented immigrants, the Supreme
Court recently refused to hear a case regarding
California's in-state tuition policy, effectively
enabling states to base policies on high school
graduation instead of legal residency. Twelve
states have approved in-state tuition for undoc-
umented students, and efforts are underway
across the country. The similarly motivated
DREAM Act seeks to grant citizenship to
undocumented students, but additional poli-
cies are necessary to improve the affordability
of higher education. In conjunction with the
passage of the DREAM Act, in-state tuition
policies will improve employment opportuni-
ties for Michigan's undocumented youth.
In Michigan, each public university deter-
mines its tuition policy, so this decision hing-
es on the University's Board of Regents. The
University's residency policies are notoriously
strict, and graduation from a Michigan high
school does not necessarily qualify one for in-
state tuition. We believe that undocumented
students who meet other residency guide-
lines should be considered for in-state tuition.
Grantingin-state tuition toundocumented stu-
dents will demonstrate the University's contin-
ued commitment to diversity and social justice.
Michigan's residency policy effectively
bars talented, qualified Michigan high school
graduates from attending the University on the
basis of their immigration status. Central Stu-
dent Government should pass our resolution
to demonstrate that Michigan students stand
for tuition equality and believe undocumented
students deserve the opportunity to become
Michigan Wolverines.

you certainly won't find Wikipedia
in any of my research papers' lists of
works cited.
But like many of my peers, I
wasn't exactly thrilled when Wiki-
pedia blacked out last Wednesday,
for 24 hours in protest of the Stop
Online Piracy Act and the Protect
Intellectual Property Act currently
being considered in the House and
Senate, respectively. Wikipedia's
blackout was part of a broader
online movement in which Google,
Reddit and thousands of other sites
stood in solidarity against the pro-
posed legislation.
I won't delve into the convoluted
history of anti-piracy legislation -
if you're interested, just (ironical-
ly!) Google it - but it's worth noting
that the bill was largely a product of
lobbying on behalf of powerhouse
media orgs like the Motion Pic-
ture Association of America, which
hired former senator turned Hol-
lywood lobbyist Chris Dodd as its
chairman last March. But with last
week's virtual protests, the animal
that is the Internet, the very thing
Dodd seeks to regulate, proved just

how formidable an opponent it real-
ly is.
The Wikipedia blackout was
beyond successful. It induced Rep.
Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to tempo-
rarily shelve SOPA. It provoked
Dodd to essentially threaten black-
mail against any politicians in
Washington who don't support the
legislation while implicitly prom-
ising Hollywood-sponsored cam-
paign funding for those who do.
But the most important success
of last week's blackout and the most
important lesson to take away from
it is this: a coordinated Internet
protest has the power to send our
government a message that can't be
ignored.
In an age of political gridlock and
Congressional ineptitude, that's
pretty powerful stuff.
The SOPA debacle is simply the
latest incarnation in the long-run-
ning tragicomedy that is Wash-
ington's relationship with the
American public. Congress is out
of touch. If that much wasn't clear
pre-SOPA, it should be common
knowledge by now.
So here's what I'm thinking.
First, can we please finally start
having a conversation about get-
ting "corporate" needs specificity
money out of politics? Or can we at
least talk about permanently shut-
ting that so-called revolving door
between public service and private
gain? Dodd went from being an
elected representative of his con-
stituents in Connecticut to being
a hired lobbyist capable of using
his political clout for the benefit of
Hollywood producers. Is that all
right?
Second, the Wikipedia blackout
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

has me thinking about the potential
good that concerted Internet pro-
tests might do in the future. Forbes
reported that 4.5 million people
signed Google's anti-censorship
petition. Meanwhile, Wikipedia's
lockdown compelled 8 million
Americans to call their representa-
tives and demand an end to the anti-
piracy legislation. That, I think, is a
good thing.
The Internet
proved how
formidable it is.
Perhaps these Internet giants did
our democracy a favor. When was
the last time millions thought it
worthwhile to contact their elected
leaders for a specific cause? .I'd be
hard-pressed to remember a time
when so many Americans, particu-
larly young people, cared this deep-
ly about any political issue.
As long as people are aware of
the absurdity that our political sys-
tem so often seems to foster, let's
keep an eye on other political issues
that might be blackout-worthy -
like going to war, for instance, or
indefinitely detaining American
citizens without trial. You know,
other important stuff that receives
too little attention.
So thanks for the blackout, Wiki-
pedia. We needed it.

PIAZZA
From Page 1A
said he was surprised by the suc-
cess he's experienced with Piazza
so far. At first, he dismissed it as
"one more thing" to deal with at
the beginning of the semester and
feared that it would be similar to
the CTools chat room, in which
his students would give away
answers by telling others to sim-
ply plug in numbers to a formula.
However, Tarle said Piazza is
more organized than the CTools
chat room because questions are
sorted into color-coded threads,
making it easier to discern which
responses are from the instruc-
tor, the graduate student instruc-
tors or other students.
The instructor can also
"endorse" a particular answer
that he or she has deemed correct
and that other students should
use as guidance.
He added that students'
questions get answered almost
immediately since he and his
GSIs check the forum frequently
throughout the day to provide
answers and explanations.
"It's easy to get your questions
answered without a lot of one-on-
one time," Tarle stated.
Tarle said using Piazza is ben-
eficial for facilitating discussion
among students that help them
learn. While the program sends
MOTT
From Page 1A
providing gas cards to families
that frequently commute to the
hospital.
"We're also taking donations
for Mott," Gavin said. "Because
obviously, even though the build-
ing is open, there are many pro-
grams and services that Mott
offers that are donation-based."
Prior to the show and during
intermission, children were invit-

him e-mail notifications when a
post has been made, he said by
the time he logs on, a student in
the class has often already pro-
vided the correct answer to the
problem.
Tarle added that he spends
significantly less time answer-
ing questions in office hours or
by e-mail because of the pro-
gram.
"It definitely has reduced the
amount of work I have to do
meeting with a lot of students
and individually taking them
through problems," Tarle stated.
Rackham student Holly
Tederington, electrical engi-
neering and computer science
instructor, agrees that Piazza
has been easier to use than the
CTools chat room - which has
caused problems for students
in the past because users could
not determine which responses
were posted by an instructor.
Tederington said another
helpful feature for students is
the option to post a private ques-
tion so only the instructors can
view the question and provide
responses.
"It's basically a way of shar-
ing their work with us without
exposing it to the rest of the
students and still being able to
ask office hour-style questions
without coming to office hours,"
Tederington stated.
Of the 402 students enrolled
ed to partake in an "instrument
petting zoo," where they could try
out different instruments with
the help of volunteer musicians.
Gavin said Urbach, who trav-
els to perform at concerts to raise
money for children, first contact-
ed LSO when he was only 13 years
old. Now 19, Urbach came to play
with LSO in honor of Mott, along-
side accompanist pianist Karen
Beluso.
The concert provided attend-
ees with a range of music, includ-
ing foxtrotand tangotunes. Gavin

in EECS 280, the course Teder-
ington teaches, she said 363
students use Piazza, and the
average response time for each
question is 15 minutes, as GSIs
and instructors check it often
during the day.
LSA junior Jacquelyn Cos-
grove uses Piazza in her Physics
235 class, and she said it provides
valuable interactions between
instructors and students so stu-
dents can see if they're "on the
right track or totally lost."
Cosgrove often goes on Piazza
to look at the discussions, and
said it's especially helpful for
students who don't want to ask
questions in person.
"I think it's a good thing,"
Cosgrove said. "That way, peo-
ple who don't feel comfortable
asking questions don't necessar-
ily have to do it in person, or they
can be anonymous."
LSA junior Logan Powell, also
a Physics 235 student, said the
iPhone application for Piazza
has been particularly helpful for
him. He has asked two questions
in the forum, and when some-
one posts a response, he receives
notifications similar to a text
message so he can view it imme-
diately.
"It's just nice to have a forum
to use," Powell stated. "It's bet-
ter than the chat room that
CTools has because you can put
in symbols."
said conductor Oriol Sans wanted
the concert to have elements of a
serious classical concert, while
still being family-friendly.
She added that at most tradi-
tional orchestral concerts, the
conductor does not address the
audience, but Sans interacted
with the audience to make it more
fun.
"Basically it's a really wide
range in the type of music but
it's all danceable," she said. "We
expect kids to be dancing in the
aisles."

FINANCIAL AID
From Page 1A
experiment's term expired this
year and the University must now
enforce the Title IV regulation,
which requires students to com-
plete their degrees more quickly,
according to Fowler.
The policies laid out in Title IV
say that students must continue
to earn their grants by remain-
ing enrolled and completing the
necessary amount of credit hours
each year. A student can either
be officially withdrawn from the
University through ceased enroll-
ment, or unofficially withdrawn
by failing a class, Fowler said.
While students who officially
withdraw must return their grant
money, students who withdraw
unofficially are only forced to
repay the grant in some cases.
Fowler said the process of reg-
ulating loan proration is challeng-
ing for students who graduate a
term early, since it prevents them
from receiving their full potential
grant or loan money.
"There comes a point in time,
especially when you're borrowing
money and taking the taxpayers'
money, that the goal here is to get
a degree, and you should get that
as quickly and efficiently as pos-

sible," Fowler said.
Fowler said the process of
determining the cause of an unof-
ficial withdrawal often results
in disputes over grant money,
particularly challenging when
dealing with the approximately
10,000 University students who
have federal loans or grants.
"I have to go through every
single term and get a list of all
the students that have an 'F,' and
determine if that student just
walked away from their classes or
if that student really earned the
'F,"' Fowler said.
She said one of the reasons
issues over dispersing grant
money arises is due to the univer-
sality of the regulations.
"(The loan and grant regula-
tions) don't always apply to every-
body, but everybody has to follow
the same rules and regulations,"
Fowler said.
Beyond resistance atthe univer-
sity level, the advisory committee
on Student Financial Assistance
- an independent organization
that provides information to Con-
gress on student aid related issues
- filed a report on Dec. 7 that
reviewed regulations for dispens-
ing federal loans and grants to
college students, giving particular
scrutiny to Title IV loans.
Rich Williams, higher educa-

Monday, January 23, 2012 - 5A
tion advocate for the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, said the
regulations are in place to provide
security forthe federal moneythat
is allocated to higher education.
"(The regulations are) wide-
ranging and cover various issues
to prevent fraud and the integrity
of the financial aid program for
students," Williams said.
Williams said the advisory
committee on Student Financial
Assistance is currently reviewing
the regulations and recognizes
their ineffectiveness for certain
higher-education situations.
"Maybe some (regulations) are
needed less than others," Wil-
liams said. "The committee is
taking a look at what those could
be and finding a wayto streamline
them."
In addition to ensuring that
grant and loan money is being

strom, director of the Higher
Education Debt Project, said stu-
dent welfare is also a primary
concern in constructing federal
regulations.
"(We) view student loans and
regulation through the lens of

From Page 1A
number of protestors killed to be
over 5,000 people.
There have also been attacks
on the medical personnel who
have attempted to treat pro-
testers, The Los Angeles Times
reported. Arabi said he hopes
protests like the one held yester-
day can help spur increased sup-
port to help doctors in Syria who
maybe in danger.
"We need to increase the
pressure on the international
community and the interna-
tional society to help the medical
community (do its) jobs in Syria
without fear of any repression,"
he said.
Arabi said the work provided
by Syrian medical personnel to

protesters is not only crucial, but
also a part of their duty as doc-
tors.
"We need to treat patients
regardless of their political back-
ground, regardless of their ethi-
cal background," he said. "(We
need to) do our duty (and) fulfill
our oath."
Nour Akhras, a pediatrician at
Children's Hospital of Michigan
in Detroit, said she participated
in the protest because of the dif-
ficult conditions faced by medi-
cal personnel in Syria.
"I think it is appalling that
physicians in Syria are being
attacked while they are trying to
attend to wounded protesters,"
she said.
Akhras said she went to Tur-
key to treat Syrian refugees in
the refugee camps there. The
United Nations estimated that

the government crackdown on
the protests resulted in more
than 12,400 Syrian refugees.
Like Arabi, Akhras said she
hopes the protest will raise
awareness about the violence in
Syria.
"I don't know if a lot of the
people know that the citizens
in Syria are being attacked and
tortured, imprisoned and threat-
ened," Akhras said.
Akhras, a native Syrian with
relatives in Homs, Syria - the
epicenter of the protests - said
a resolution to the violence in
Syria is important to her.
"I am in between night shifts
but I came today, although I am
super tired, because this is a
worthy cause," she said.

Context adds to experiencing art

While I was home in
Cincinnati during
our all-too-short
winter break, I had the opportu-
nity to see Tchaikovsky's "The
Nutcracker."
Of course,
being in
Cincinnati
means you
don't go just
anywhere to
see a perfor-
mance - you LAUREN

the sleek and
luxurious
Aronoff Center.
Going to a show at this mas-
sive space is an evening-long
affair. You must first drive to the
heart of downtown Cincinnati,
park a few blocks away and take
a vibrant nighttime walk past
the lights, sights and sounds that
make up the soul of the Queen
City. After passing through the
venue's glass doors, up its marble
staircase and around its wind-
ing hallways, you finally emerge
in the magnificent performance
gallery known as Proctor &
Gamble Hall.
As I snuggled deeper into my
plush red seat while watching
my fellow patrons awkwardly
shuffle into theirs, I anticipated
what would come next: Soon,
all 2,719 spaces would be filled.
Next would come the magical,
collective hush that accompanies
the dimming of the lights. The
pause between darkness falling
and the beginning of the show
would hang over all of us, unit-

It's the presence of these ele-

expression of despair, a visionary

Art isn't a singular visual or

crafted experience in which the
construction of an environment
to support that art is often just
as important as the art atits cen-
ter. The hustle and bustle of our
daily lives can sometimes drown
the extraordinary in the ordi-
nary, allowing us to gloss over
beauty or talent without a frame
in which to see them.
So enjoy the show - the entire
show - from the time you pick
out your dress shirt and put on
your heels, to the time you spend
goggling ata theater's intricately
painted ceiling, to the time you
spend raving to your fellows
about your favorite actress on
the car ride back home.
Because there's no denying
that art should be insightful,
inspirational and thought-
provoking atits core. But some-
times, picking the right pedestal
is just as important as the statue
you place on top.

"Poetry (is) more necessary

"Salting the

said Megan Levad, assistant
director of the MFA program
at the 'U.' "Her work has such
reach, because she writes so
broadly, and also reaches to a
wide audience."
She added, "It's exciting to
bring in somebody who will
bring together a lot of different
audiences ... not just university
students and faculty, (but also)
community members and peo-
ple driving in from around the
area."
Nye has often spoken up
for Arab-American culture,
expressing indignation at preju-
dice through her work.
"I think (Nye's writing is)
ideal for the University of Mich-
igan," said Levad, who runs
the Zell Visiting Writer Series.
"I think it ... perfectly reflects
the sort of bridging of cultural
backgrounds that happens when
people come together for edifi-
cation and inspiration."
Nye's poetry has often been
lauded: She has received numer-
ous awards, including the Acad-
emy of American Poets' Lavan
Award, the Carity Randall Prize,
as well as four Pushcart Prizes.
She has been recognized as a
Lannan Fellow, a Witter Bynner
Fellow and a Guggenheim Fel-
low, and served as chancellor at
the Academy of American Poets.
"Formally (her writing)
is fairly simple," Levad said.
"People don't feel like they need
to have some long experience
in poetry to understand and
enjoy her work. If you read it
more closely ... it will continue
to reveal to you the depth of its
intelligence."
Nye will take part in three
main events this week. Tonight,
she will lead a poetry reading in
the Museum Apse at the Univer-
sityof Michigan Museum of Art.

Born in St. Louis, Mo., Nye
grew up in a variety of locations
around the world, which may be
part of the reason she chooses to
refer to herself as a "wandering
poet." She has traveled around
the world three times for the
United States Information

She is the author or co-editor
of 25 books including "19 Vari-

Alluring 'Alcatraz'

'Tails' has valiant
aim, fails to take off

FOX's suspenseful
new show deserves
attention
By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily Arts Writer
It has been two years, but net-
work television is still scattering
the pieces of the "Lost" empire into
new ventures.
FOX's "Alca- ****
traz" is the
latest of those Alcatraz
t enterprises and Pilot
Bad Robot's
most successful Mondays at 9 p.m.
and suspenseful FOX
new show since
that fateful plane crash.
The most notable similar-
ity between "Lost" and "Alcatraz"
(let's just get it out of the way now)
is composer Michael Giacchino's
score,whichevokeseven more nos-
talgia than hearing Jorge Garcia
say "Last time I was on the island
..." in total seriousness. There's no
mistaking the eerie glissandos and
tremolos punctuated by jarring
jabs on the cello, and the ever-so-
telling horn crescendo that marks
each act break.
By television standards in the
post-"Lost" world, "Alcatraz" is
an exemplary pilot. It introduces a
small but compelling cast who are
neither too enigmatic nor too open.
It's set up as a mystery, but it's not
confusing.
Now, back to the island. The
story behind "Alcatraz" is that
302 prisoners vanished from the
penitentiary in 1963 on the night
they were supposed to be relocated
before it shut down permanently.
Fifty years later, the misplaced
convicts are reappearing and run-
ning amok, and it's up to detective
Rebecca Madsen (Sarah Jones,
"Big Love") and intrepid scholar

"We have to go back."
Diego Soto (Garcia) to track them
down and bring them to justice ...
again.
Jones plays the most recent in
a long-overdue lineup of power-
ful female leads. She's impetu-
ous and gun-savvy and doesn't
take shit from people: When FBI
agent Emerson Hauser (Sam Neill,
"JurassicPark") overrules her juris-
diction in a crime scene, she leaves
with a glare and a scathing "thanks
for being such a dick about it."
It turns out Hauser knows sig-
nificantly more about what's hap-
pening than Madsen and Soto, so
the duo helps him find missing
prisoners in exchange (hopefully)
for further information about the
incident. When it's revealed that
Hauser was present on the night
of the disappearance, his single-
minded manhunt and the patience
behind it make more sense. But
when it turns out he's tracking the
prisoners in order to repopulate
his own underground version of
Alcatraz, things take a turn for the
twisted.
The first inmate to turn up is
Jack Sylvane (Jeffrey Pierce, "The
Nine") who is surprisingly unfazed
that he woke up fifty years after his
alarm clock rang and hasn't aged
a day. His overwhelming emo-

tion is vengeful rage against those
who landed him on the rock in the
first place. Sylvane wakes up in the
prison itself - much to the alarm'of
a little girl in a tour group - only
to escape, go on a killing spree and
be brought back bythe equally vin-
dictive Hauser. But where are the
other prisoners reappearing, and
how?
The plot is neat and straightfor-
ward, but undeniably engrossing:
despite Diego's quip of "is anyone
else's head exploding right now?"
there's no exploding to be done.
The twists come in appropriate
doses, the biggest being saved for
the end of the two-part pilot - if
the first 87 minutes haven't already
hooked you, the last minute might
just do the trick.
As the episodes are named for
the vanished escapees and they're
tracked one per episode, it could
easily get old if the writers planned
on introducing and resolving the
prisoners in these episode arcs. But
it looks for the moment as if the
prisoners will be sticking around
and playing a larger role in under-
standing just what happened in
1963. "Alcatraz" is off to a better
start than most new dramas, and
there's no reason for it to vanish
any time soon.

Sadly, that's not always the

the George Lucas-produced

the fighter pilots' story. It's not
that there's anything blatantly
idiotic in the performances,

There are your typical run-

expected plot developments
and somewhat-entertaining air
fights. Nothing seems out of
place. But at the end of the day,
that's the problem - it's just all-

FILM REVIEW
Soderbergh slips up

FiLM REVIEW
Biopic carried by Streep

Star-studded
'Haywire' trods
along without a plot
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
Actors seem to share a mag-
netic connection with Steven
Soderbergh ("Contagion")
these days -
oh wait, they
always have.
From "Ocean's
Eleven" in 2001
to last year's At Quality16
"Contagion," and Rave
everyone,
from Brad Pitt Relativity Media
("Moneyball")
to the venerable Kate Winslet
("Carnage"), has flocked to work
with Soderbergh in films flood-
ed with A-list actors. And that's
probably because he tends to
deliver. The snappy scripts, mys-
terious cinematography and cool
soundtracks that have come to
define Soderbergh's films almost
always pay off at the box office
and beyond.
That is, of course, almost
always. Not this time. It's painful
and pitiful to admit "Haywire"
lacks the style and elegance of a
Soderbergh feature - so much so
that even Michael Douglas ("Wall
Street: Money Never Sleeps"),
Ewan McGregor ("Begin-
ners") and Hollywood's newest
obsession Michael Fassbender
("Shame") couldn't make this film
the slightest bit intriguing. Nei-
ther could the mystery and antici-
pation surrounding the casting of
MMA fighter Gina Carano in the
lead role. Yeah, the girl had some
great action sequences that she no
doubt orchestrated. But looking
past the fight scenes and Carano
herself, the movie really has noth-
ingsubstantial to offer.
At a closer glance, the prob-
lem with "Haywire" is quite

"This is howI tell people I care."
simple: It lacks a plot. And that's
truly disappointing because
Soderbergh's ventures usually
have a lot more than just star-
studded casts - they're also
identified by those little myste-
rious twists that make his films
so captivating to watch. More
disappointing is that this film
had so much potential for some
smartly placed twists and turns.
In spite of its ridiculously
large and supremely talented
cast, "Haywire" revolves around
Carano's character Mallory. It's
a tad bit ironic, seeing as Carano
is the least talented actor (but
she's not an actress, so can we
blame her?). Mallory gets caught
up in her employer's "mysteri-
ous" plot to kill her and is forced
to make a hasty escape. She's
sent on a mission to rescue a
kidnapped journalist in Barce-
lona, but little does she know
that it's all a scheme to convict
her of other people's crimes.
At this point, you might ask for
the motives behind such a devi-
ous conspiracy. But in this film,
there are none. Except money,
maybe, but that's definitely not a
compelling premise on which to
base a two-and-a-half hour film.
The rest of the film has Mal-
lory hunting down those who
wronged her, leading to the
untimely death of almost all of

the film's remaining characters.
McGregor, Fassbender, Douglas
and Channing Tatum ("Dear
John") apparently agreed to
play some of the most insignifi-
cant characters of their careers
- a testament to the power of
Soderbergh's credibility (which
might, after this film, come
under a little bit of scrutiny). To
say the talents of such big names
were wasted would be an under-
statement.
At the end of the day, Soder-
bergh only had eyes for Carano.
Her daring moves were the sole
reason that half the audience
didn't walk out of the cinema.
But Soderbergh should have
realized that she isn't enough to
drive a film. There was action,
but no story. Why were the bad
guys after Mallory? Why did
they conspire against their best
agent? These were the questions
the voice in the trailer asked, but
the film failed to answer.
"Haywire" had neither the
special effects of an action film
nor the story of a thriller. Ulti-
mately, it was a mediocre attempt
at an "Ocean's"-meets-"Bourne"
enterprise that did nothing for
anybody involved. It's at this
point that Mallory's most cheesy
and annoyingly unforgettable
line comes to mind: "You better
run." From this film, definitely.

No doubt about it: Meryl Streep
is freaking awesome. But no mat-
ter how well-executed the por-
trayal of its protagonist, "The
Iron Lady" is a dull and scattered
affair. Director Phyllida Lloyd
("Mama Mia"), in an attempt to
create a balanced depiction of
Margaret Thatcher, spends too
much time focusing on the incon-
sequential aspects of the former
Prime Minister's life. We get too
much about the husband and chil-
dren Thatcher left behind and
virtually nothing concerning the
polarizing political policies she
put in place as the first female
leader of Great Britain.
And it's unfortunate, because
the same gender stigmas Thatch-
er challenged with her appoint-
ment are painfully apparent in
this movie. The telling of a male
leader's story wouldn't require
ceaseless commentary about his
shortcomings as a father and hus-
band. Nor would it breeze over the
better part of said leader's politi-
cal undertakings via a meaning-
less montage sequence.
But in "The Iron Lady," that's
exactly what happens, leaving the
audience with a typical rags-to-
riches story of a grocer's daughter
going off to college, and eventu-
ally, tentatively dipping her foot
into the political arena.

rim out in another

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD

Trey Burke's 3-point attempt
as the clock expired escaped
the cylinder, and Michigan's
hopes of completing an epic
comeback found another cylin-
der: the garbage can.
The freshman point guard's
step-back jumper skidded
across the rim, and when the
ball came down, the Wolver-

ines (5-2 Big Ten, 15-5 overall)
were still winless in true road
games, losing 66-64 against
Arkansas on Saturday.
"We were trying to just get
(Burke) downhill," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein about
the last play. "Trying to get to
the basket, or if they gapped,
hit a guy for a three. We
weren't going to get both. So
when he tried to turn the cor-
ner, he didn't, then he sort of
went for his own, which would
have been a great ending."

half, Michigan cut the Razor-

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Michigan maintains perfect
record at Crisler Center

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
With 13 minutes left in
the second half of the Michi-
gan women's basketball game
against
Indiana INDIANA 48
on Sunday, MICHIGAN 66
the Hoo-
siers drilled three 3-pointers
in less than a minute. The Wol-
verines called a timeout, even
though the scoreboard read
50-31 in favor of Michigan.
It was one moment of worry
on the road to an easy victory
over Indiana, 66-48. The Hoo-
siers held the lead only once,
in the game's first sequence off
of the jump ball. From the next
play on, the Wolverines were
determined to not let Indi-
ana's lead stand - the Hoosiers
trailed for the rest of the game.
Indiana now finds among the
number of teams Michigan has
beat down this season. While
it was expected that the worst
team in the Big Ten wouldn't
give the Wolverines much trou-

ble, their nine-point second-
half run was significant enough
to catch the attention of Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth.
"They made nine points in
a minute," Borseth said. "A
30-point lead went to 20 in a
minute. Add another minute to
that and we could have found
ourselves in trouble. You can't
take anything for granted in
this game. Indiana never quit.
They came out hard in the sec-
ond half. Luckily, we did a good
job of taking care of the ball."
Taking care of the ball and a
solid five-men-out motion were
two major keys for the Wolver-
ines, who had all kinds of suc-
cess inside the arc and around
the rim. Junior center Rachel
Sheffer had a game-high 16
points. She was followed closely
behind by senior guard Court-
ney Boylan, who racked up 15.
"When we went five-out, we
really opened up the middle,"
Sheffer said. "We are fortu-
nate that we have a team where
everyone can drive and handle
the ball and dish to our shoot-

ers. We had a lot of great looks
today."
While it may not have been
a major issue given the blow-
out score, Michigan struggled
from the 3-point line and on the
glass. The Wolverines shot just
17.4-percent from beyond the
arc and had 10 less rebounds
than the Hoosiers.
Though Michigan came into
the game with enough con-
fidence to overtake Indiana,
the team's size and talent were
a concern. During and after
the game, however, it became
apparent that something was
missing from this Hoosier team.
"They are a big, strong team
and only one step away from
being truly great." Boylan said.
"They have a girl who's 6-foot-6
and shoots 44-percent from the
3-point line. With a little devel-
opment, she may be that one
step. That's just one example of
the many potential assets they
have on that team."
Boylan was completely
serious. There is no obliga-

Examing the lasting legacy o Joe Paterno

Inever met Joe Paterno.
Six months ago, I was in
a media scrum surrounding
the longtime Penn State head
coach at the Big Ten Media Days
in Chicago. I
saw Paterno,
but I never
met the man.
Through
the lens of the
Canon T2i
camera in my
hands, I saw -
a shrinking STEPHEN J.
85-year-old NESBITT
man with --
Coke-bottle
glasses perched on his nose.Old
enough to be the father of every
other Big Ten coach, he didn't
really fit in.
But he was JoePa. He was a
legend.
Primed to begin his 46th sea-
son at the helm in State College,
Paterno was asked how long he'd
keep coaching. He laughed.
"I'd like to coach as long as
I feel like I can do a good job,"
Paterno said. "If there comes a
time where maybe I don't feel like
getting on the field andI can't run
around, can't demonstrate..."
Paterno trailed off. His health
had been deteriorating in the past
year, but things were turning back
around. There were hills around
his home on 830 McKee Street
that gave him a good workout,
and he walked to and from the
stadium whenever he could. He
hoped to coach four or five more
seasons, but coaching into his 90s
was always going to be a stretch -

College football is forever
changed. There won't be another
coach like him. Never again will
a city, university and football
program be synonymous with a
single name: Joe Paterno.
"College football has lost one
of its greatest, a coachingticon,"
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
in a statement released Sunday.
Now you and I both have to
decide how to remember him.
His legacy might be tarnished
in your eyes, but it shouldn't be.
It isn't tarnished for thousands of
his former players who knew him
most intimately. They didn't turn
on their coach in the last 11 weeks,
though some were ashamed with
Penn State.
"His players' love for him, it
shows how he touched their lives
and it tells who he was asa man,"
Hoke said. "He will be missed.
His mark on Penn State and col-
lege football will neverbe forgot-
ten."
If nothing else, don't judge
Paterno by the mistakes of anoth-
er man. I never met Joe Paterno,
and in all likelihood, neither did
you.
Former Michigan coach Lloyd
Carr met him. He remembers
Paterno's "competitive spirit,
incredible generosity, his honesty,
his integrity and his humanity."
I'd like to remember JoePa that
way too.
Because for so many of us, Joe
Paterno was iconic. He was a leg-
end. He was Penn State.

Former Penn State coach Joe Paterno passed away on Sunday in State College at the age of 85. He coached the Nittany Lions football program for 46 years.

"That number maybe optimistic,"
he cautioned.
Paterno often referenced a
quote from a friend of his, jour-
neyman coach Marv Levy.
"I'm old enough to know my
limitations," Levy would say, "and
I'm young enough to know how to
handle 'em."
JoePa knew how to handle 'em.
For 45 years, he ran the cleanest
program in college football - his
hard-nosed, businesslike players
were proof. LaVarr Arrington.
Matt Millen. Mike Munchak.
But some of Paterno's final

comments in Chicago were fore-
boding.
"It may be up to somebody else
to make a decision as to whether
I'm effective or not for what the
program needs," Paterno said.
It was just a wizened old coach
staying humble.
Wasn't it?
What happened in the next
175 days is nearly inexplicable. It
was a nightmare, a cruel twist in
the legacy of the legendary Joe
Paterno.
Despite the lack of a true
quarterback and with dipping

expectations in 2011, the Nittany
Lions charged out to an 8-1 start,
good for first place in the Big Ten.
Then, with one tell-all report,
Paterno's program was embroiled
in perhaps the most revolting
scandal in modern-day sports.
A former assistant coach, Jerry
Sandusky, was being pressed with
a battery of charges - some of
the most heinous acts imaginable.
Victim after victim came forward.
Penn State President Graham
Spanier and Athletic Director
Tim Curley were fired.
Then, the attention turned to

Paterno. He knew. How much?
We'll never know, buthe knew
something and he did something.
But he didn't do enough.
On the evening of Nov. 9, with
Happy Valley in protest, the Penn
State Board of Directors made
their decision. They placed a short
phone call and told Paterno his
tenure as head coach had come to
an end.
Eleven weeks later, lung cancer
caught up to Paterno. He died at
9:30 on Sunday morning. He died
of cancer. He died of old age. He
died of a broken heart.

Michigan tops No. 1 Penn State
ByALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer

Once the chalk dust settled
down from the start of the
season, the Michigan's men's
gymnastics
team began PSU 338.45
to find its MICH. 340.3
rhythm.
The sixth-ranked Wolver-
ines (1-0 Big Ten, 4-2 over-
all) defeated No. 1 Penn State,
340.3-338.45, on Saturday night
at Cliff Keen Arena.
Coming off a disappointing
third-place finish at the Windy
City Invitational in Chicago
last week, Michigan found its
groove against the nation's top
squad.
"Last week, we didn't have a
good showing," said freshman
Stacey Ervin. "Today, we just
came out supporting ourselves."
With a personal-best on vault
(14.49) and his first career all-
around title (83.7), freshman
Adrian de los Angeles helped
lead the team past the Nit-
tany Lions (0-1, 1-1). In addi-
tion, sophomore Dylan James
claimed the pommel horse title
(14.2) and senior Syque Caesar
took first place on the parallel
bars (14.7).
But it was Ervin who set the
tone of the event with a career-
best (14.9) on floor. As he raised
his arms at the end of his rou-
tine, the crowd came to its feet.
"(My) floor routine has been a
little shaky in practice lately, but
I was pretty confident coming
into competition," Ervin said.
"The warm-up felt great, the
team was behind me and cheer-
ing me on the whole way. I was

From there, the rest was his-
tory.
"Today, we started off on
floor really well. We had alot of
energy, we got off on the right
foot," de los Angeles said.
Despite a few falls, Michigan
was ready to make up for its dis-
appointing finish at Windy City.
"Last week was a little
rough," de los Angeles said. "But
that definitely gave us motiva-
tion to get back to the gym and
work our butts off."
The most troublesome event
for the Wolverines was the high
bar, where three gymnasts fell
in the middle of their routines.
"High bar was a little rough,"
Caesar said. "We could've done
better on high bar. Overall, we
had three falls, and we are try-
ing to limit it (down) to two or

one."
Added Ervin: "The high bar
is one of my biggest weaknesses.
That fall wasn't uncharacter-
istic of me, but I'm working on
that as well."
Despite Ervin's fall, he was
awarded the program's Newt
Loken Award for his effort at
the meet, leading Michigan to
defeat a top-ranked team for the
first time since Jan. 23, 2004
- which also happened to be a
Penn State squad. The Wolver-
ines won without 2011 NCAA
All-Around Champion sopho-
more Sam Mikulak, who is
training with the United States
National Team in Colorado.
"All week, we had been talk-
ing about coming out and hit-
ting our sets," Ervin said. "We
had to just come together and
just do everything we've been
practicing and do everything
we can do."

Michigan junior center Rachel Sheffer scored a game-high 16 points on 7-for-9 shooting against Indiana on Sunday at Crisier Center. Michigan won 66 48.
All-around effort propels Wol-
verines over Hoosiers at home

Sheffer's 16 points
0 leads 'M' to 16-4
overall record
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
It was another typical win for
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team.
The team's defensive play was
outstanding thanks to a high-
energy squad that played a full
40 minutes of staunch defense.
And the bench played its nor-
mal role, contributing on offense
while playing an equally-impor-
tant role on defense, helping the
Wolverines to a 66-48 victory
over Indiana (0-7 Big Ten, 5-15
overall).
But the difference in the
offense was evident after an
abysmal point-scoring effort
against Northwestern last
Thursday.
Michigan (5-2, 16-4) came out
ready to attack, posting a sea-
son-high 42 first-half points on
53-percent shooting. Compare
that to last Thursday, when it
shot just 26.7 percent from the
field.
What changed? Good passing
against Indiana's zone defense.
SPLIT
From Page 1B
In the first game of the series
split it worked. No. 7 Notre Dame
took the opener, 3-1, before No. 10
Michigan salvaged the split with a
2-1 decision on Saturday.
"I think they played a really
dirty game, I'm going to be hon-
est," said freshman forward Alex
Guptill on Saturday. "It was dirty;
it was a mean series. You had to be
playing tough out there to get any
kind of ice."
Senior forward Luke Glenden-
ing emphasized that the series
was particularly intense because
of the strength and style of each
team. Hunwick received extra
attention, but players from both
sides hit hard and often, combin-
ing for a total of 58 penalty min-
utes.
In the first period of the open-
er, scrums broke out after nearly
every whistle, especially around
Michigan's goal. The referees had
to call both team captains togeth-

"We really (practiced) their
zone," said junior forward
Rachel Sheffer. "Coach figured
it out on film, and we were prac-
ticing for hours with their zone.
We had great passes and found
people wide open underneath."
All night, Sheffer and junior
forward Sam Arnold had open
looks under the basket and con-
verted their layups. Sheffer
posted a game-high 16 points
on 7-for-9 shooting, and Arnold
contributed seven of her own.
In Big Ten play, Sheffer is
averaging 14 points per game
and has been the biggest fac-
tor in Michigan's post-play. Her
effort against Indiana didn't go
unnoticed.
"(Rachel) did a really good
job of breaking the defense
down," said senior guard Court-
ney Boylan. "When she got in
the corner, she did a really good
job of penetrating the middle,
looking for people, or taking a
shot when it was open."
The shots were falling for the
rest of the team as well. Ten of
the 13 players who got in the
game tallied points, and the
team shot 43 percent on the day.
Sheffer noted how good ball
rotation helped the team get into
a rhythm, which in turn boosted
its confidence to knock down
er after the opening frame to calm
the tempers.
Berenson wouldn't comment
on Notre Dame's strategy toward
Hunwick, other than saying he
hoped it wasn't their strategy at
all.
"I hope it's not," Berenson said.
"We don't do that to another goal-
ie. We go to the net, but we don't
run into the goalie or we're not
spraying snow on him or what-
ever."
Notre Dame got to the net often.
The Irish scored a goal in each of
the first two periods to take a 2-0
lead on Friday. The Wolverines
couldn't recover despite a power-
play goal by Guptill in the third
period.
Notre Dame applied even more
pressure in the second game. In
fact, Berenson said he thought
the Irish were the better team in
their losing effort in the finale,
though he thought Michigan had
more chances in its loss in the
opener.
Despite the Irish's physical
defense, the Wolverines made a

COMEBACK
From Page 1B
to 20 points before the Wolver-
ines started to claw back. Once
the Razorback shooting percent-
ages came back to Earth, the lead
came back down, too.
"We've got a lot of courage in
that locker room," Beilein said.
"We've got a lot of tough kids that
will not give in to fatigue, won't
give in to crowds. They hang in
there"
After whittling its deficit
down to 13 at the half, Michigan
was within single digits just five
minutes into the second half.
Morgan scored eight-straight
points to close the Razorback lead
to 49-43 before Arkansas called a
timeout to stop the bleeding.
The bleeding didn't stop, and
neither did forms of actual physi-
cal harm. Novak clubbed Arkan-
sas guard B. J. Young in the head
on a fast-break layup attempt and
was called for a flagrant foul.
"All I know is Zack Novak
plays hard as can be and plays as
clean as can be," Beilein said. "So
ARKANSAS

11 field-goal attempts of the game
- more consecutive baskets than
Michigan had given up all sea-
son - before the run mercifully
ended when guard Rashad Mad-
den missed a 3-pointer from the
left corner with 9:50 left in the
first half. Arkansas was already
up 19 points.
"They really came out and
made all their shots," Beilein said.
"Some of them were just transi-
tion (opportunities), and they
really got good looks. They got
tough looks that went in, and then
the momentum builds."
Given the box score - Arkan-
sas finished the half with a field-
goal percentage of 65.4 and made
four of its seven 3-point attempts
- one would think the Razor-
backs' run resulted from Michi-
gan's subpar defensive play.
And the Wolverines did have
plenty of defensive weak spots.
Early on, they allowed the speedy
Razorback guards to get to the
rim at will, even in half-court sets.
Michigan also hurt itself by miss-
ing jumpers on the offensive end,
allowing Arkansas to get out in
transition. While the Razorbacks
don't really embody the "40 Min-
utes of Hell" mantra that Mike
Anderson-coached teams are
known for, they do have a potent
fast-break attack.
That was evidenced by their
successful run-outs after Wolver-
ine misses. Michigan, was also
stymied by Arkansas' occasional
full-court pressure. The team had
six turnovers in the first frame,
thus giving up even more transi-
tion opportunities. That's not a
terrible number, but mistakes are
magnified against a team like the
Razorbacks.
But in many instances, the
Wolverines did play great defense,
only to see Arkansas make a tough
shot anyway. It was just one of
those days for the defense.
Nothing Michigan tried in the
first half to stop the Arkansas
attack seemed to work. Beilein
deployed the 1-3-1zone 12 minutes
into the frame, but Scott just shot

over it, making a jumper to extend

I'm sure there was no ill intent."
But Arkansas wasn't able to
convert on either free-throw
attempt or the ensuing posses-
sion, and the Wolverine attack
continued.
Burke came alive in the final
minutes of the game, scoring
seven of Michigan's final ten
points, and assisting on a 3-point-
er by Novak, which brought the
Wolverines within two points.
Novak buried five-of-seven
3-point attempts and led Michi-
gan with 17 points.
In the final minute, Arkansas
couldn'tmake its free throws and
provided the Wolverines with a
chance to tie.
Michigan had 65 seconds in
its final possession to try to force
overtime, but Burke had a better
idea - a win.
After looking to find space in
the lane to penetrate, he settled
for the try at a game-winner and
the Wolverines had to settle for
yet another road loss.
"It came off my hand right,"
Burke told UM Hoops. "Looked
good going into the basket. Ittjust
didn't fall."
his team's lead to 19 ptints, 31-12.
When senior guard St Doug-
lass hit a 3-pointer with four and a
half minutes left in the first frame
to punctuate a 7-2 mini run for the
Wolverines, it appeared they had
stolen some of the momentum
back from the home team. But,
continuing the pattern, Arkansas
followed that with a basket of its
own, pushing its lead back out
to 16 points and killing another
Michigan attempt to get things
rolling. The defense's frustrations
were summed up by a play a cou-
ple minutes after that. Razorback
guard B. J. Young drove into the
lane, guarded by sophomore for-
ward Evan Smotrycz. The 6-foot-
3 Young stepped back and tried to
hit a fadeaway jumper, despite the
6-foot-9 Smotrycz sticking with
him and seemingly erasing any
sight angle to the basket.
But Young's shot went in any-
way. Arkansas totaled 46 points
in the first half, the most the Wol-
verines have given up before half-
time all season.
Later in the half, Michigan's
defense improved enough to get
some stops, allowing the team
to enter halftime just down 13
points, despite seeing the deficit
balloon to 20 earlier in the half.
And the Wolverines were even
better after the break, holdingthe
Razorbacks to a 7-for-22 perfor-
mance from the field in the second
half. The only glaring miscue was
a botched pick-and-roll late in the
game. Senior guard Zack Novak
was tardy in providing help after
Arkansas big man Hunter Mick-
elson found himself wide open
in the lane. Mickelson's basket
with 42 seconds left in the game
proved to be the winning score.
Other than that, Michigan's
second-half defense was excel-
lent. And it does say something
that the Wolverines were able to
come back like they did, especial-
ly on the road.
Still, one is left wondering how
the game might have turned out
if, early on, the Razorbacks didn't
manage to shoot as unconsciously
as they did.
"It took us a while to get adjust-
ed, but once we did, we played a
pretty good game," Beilein said.

"The early lead hurt us."

startling discovery in South Bend
- their power-play unit is in fact
allowed to score goals. Like, even
multiple times.
In Saturday's game, the Wol-
verines scored twice in the first
period, both with the man advan-
tage.
All three Michigan goals in the
series came on the power play,
despite not converting on the
advantage since the finale of the
Great Lakes Invitational on Dec.
30.
More than halfway through
the first period on Saturday, Gup-
till tallied his second goal of the
series when he deflected a shot
from senior forward Greg Pateryn
out of the air and into the net. He
scored on a similar deflection on
Friday.
With under a minute remain-
ing in the period, junior forward
A.J. Treais fired a wrister from
the bottom of the circle to give
Michigan a two-goal advantage.
The Irish threatened for the
remainder of the game and kept
much of the action in Michigan's
the difference in the first half
and the game. Granted, Borseth
threw in his reserve team in the
last five minutes of play, but that
second-half victory spoke louder
than words. This could have been
a battle after all - lending cre-
dence to Borseth's comment that
the Wolverines can take nothing
for granted in Big Ten play.

defensive zone.
Hunwick allowed a goal early
in the second period, but stopped
the rest to finish the victory with
38 saves.
For his part, Hunwick said
he enjoyed the intensity and
trash-talking of the series. Of all
the players in postgame inter-
views, Hunwick seemed the least
angered by the weekend's physi-
cality. And, as he explained, he
likes to talk, too.
"I'm 5-foot-6, and they're some
pretty big guys," Hunwick said.
"I'd probably do the same thing."
Hunwick also elaborated on
some of the things he heard from
the Irish.
"Call me a midget, nothing I
haven't heard since sixth grade.
Some pretty funny stuff, nothing
too bad."
Glendening was pleased with
the. way Hunwick, for the most
part, kept a level head.
"It takes a big man to do that,"
Glendening said, then added with
a laugh, "Not in that sense. But
yeah, it takes a big man to do that."
"I loved our second half, it was
awesome," said Indiana coach
Felisha Legette-Jack. "We pushed
the ball with poise and took open
shots. We ended up with the same
amount of shots as Michigan, we
just rushed half of ours. If we
focus on slowing down and get-
ting the shots we want, then we'll
be fine."

GuptiL11 earns comparison Merilleads new-
NH Ler Tomas Holmstrom i look penalty killers

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
SOUTH BEND - The Michi-
gan hockey team's power play
awoke from its nearly month-
long slumber during the Wolver-
ines' series split against Notre
Dame this weekend.
It took the season's most
physical series to date, in which
the penalty boxes were rarely
unoccupied, to ignite a spark in
the unit. In fact, the man advan-
tage was so opportunistic that
Michigan coach Red Berenson
felt compelled to liken its most
lethal scoring threat, freshman
forward Alex Guptill, to Detroit
Red Wings forward Tomas Hol-
mstrom.
"It's good to see the power
play get some confidence and
get something going," Berenson
said. "I (said) last week we were
getting better, and I think we'll
continue to."
Last week's minor improve-
ments aside, the power-play unit
had to do something it failed to
do in the weeks since the Great
Lakes Invitational: get shots
through the first line of defense.
And when senior defenseman
Greg Pateryn wasn't in the pen-
alty box himself, he was rifling
shots from the point that slid
through untouched - by the
Fighting Irish defensemen, that
is.
Instead, they were redirected
by Michigan forwards - usually
Guptill, who earned the glowing
comparison from Berenson on
the strength of his pair of deflec-
tion goals in the series.
"It's definitely hand-eye coor-
dination," Berenson said of Gup-
till's scoring chances near the
crease. "You see Holmstrom do
it every night. Obviously, (Gup-
till's) got a nose for the net.
Those were big goals he scored."
Guptill chuckled when told

SOUTH BEND - Taking six
penalties in the first period would
have resulted in a disaster for the
No. 10 Michigan hockey team
earlier in the year. The penalty-
kill unit didn't have enough depth
to withstand that many minutes
that early on - especially if two
of those penalties were taken by
senior defenseman Greg Pateryn.
But after the reinstatement of
sophomore defenseman Jon Mer-
rill three weeks ago, the penalty-
kill unit has been nothing short
of a strong suit. The Wolverines
have allowed only one power-play
goal in the six games since Merrill
returned to the team.
"It's huge to have (Merrill)
back," said senior goaltender
Shawn Hunwick. "He gives
everyone else confidence. When
he gets the puck, you know he is
going to get it out."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said earlier in the week that one
of the main focuses for the week-
end was goingto be cutting down
on penalties. Friday night against
Notre Dame - with Michigan
spending more than half of the
first period in the penalty box
- was not what Berenson had
in mind. But in a physical, hard-
fought game, Michigan rolled
with the punches and fought off
an opening frame, something that
it wouldn't have been able to do a
month or two ago.
The difference between a cou-
ple months ago and last weekend
was Merrill, who was called the
best defenseman in the coun-
try by Ohio State coach Mark
Osiecki after the Frozen Diamond
Faceoff.
It's hard not to notice Merrill
when he is on the ice - a 6-foot-
3 specimen who covers ground
quicker than anyone else on the
team. He is also one of Michigan's
smartest players, seeing as he is

yet to take a penalty.
There is plenty of other talent
on the penalty-kill unit, but with
Merrill, it went from average to
standout almost overnight.
LOOKING FOR A SPARK:
Junior forward Lindsay Sparks
has been up and down more than
any Wolverine this season. He led
the team in goals in October -
but that's also the only month in
which he scored. More recently,
he has been a healthy scratch, last
playing on Dec. 9 against Michi-
gan State.
Against Notre Dame on Satur-
day, Berenson decided to mix it
up, putting Sparks in the lineup
for freshman Andrew Sinelli.
Michigan also made a change
on defense, playing freshman
Brennan Serville in place of fresh-
man Mike Chiasson.
"When your team loses a
game, you start looking around,"
said Berenson. "I think Lindsay
deserved a chance to play in a
game, and we will evaluate him as
well as Serville."
The changes came with mixed
results - Sparks picked up a
10-minute misconduct for firing a
puck at a Notre Dame player after
the whistle, a move that might
take the cake for the dumbest
plays of the year, and likely won't
help in his chase for ice time..
HOLY HUNWICK: Hunwick
has been on a tear in 2012, includ-
ing a career-high 46 saves against
Ohio State on Jan. 13. The senior
goaltender has blocked 163 of the
last 170 shots sent his way over
his last five games, good for a.958
save percentage.
For context, Union goaltender
Troy Grosenick currently leads
the country with a .937 save per-
centage.
Against Notre Dame this
weekend, Hunwick allowed just
four goals on 72 shots - Michi-
gan's MVP at it again on a week-
end that Notre Dame was giving
him some extra attention.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Michigan freshman forward Alex Guptill mixes it up in front of the net against Ohio State in the Frozen Diamond Faceoff.

Berenson associated him with
one of the NHL's most ferocious
forwards around-the-net.
"That's high praise," Guptill
said, before suggesting that he
simply got "lucky" on the second
of his scrappy power-play tallies.
In the Wolverines' 3-1 loss on
Friday night, Pateryn sent one
towards the net from the top of
the circle.
Notre Dame goaltender Steven
Summerhays said he played one
of the best games of his career,
but even he couldn't catch up to
Guptill's deflection. The third-
period tally wasn't enough to
spark a Michigan comeback, but
it did mark the Wolverines' first
goal on the man advantage since
Dec. 30.
On Saturday, the power play

conjured up a veritable copy of
Friday's goal. This time, though,
Pateryn stood at the blue line,
his shot piercing the first line of
Notre Dame defense.
The result of the play was the
same - Guptill's pretty stick
work redirected Pateryn's shot
to find twine.
"Credit to Pateryn there for
shooting the puck," Guptill said.
"It kind of gets the power play
going."
And it was only fitting that
on a weekend where power-
play scoring dominated the
Wolverine stat sheet, the game-
winning goal also came from
the man advantage. Junior for-
ward A.J. Treais received a pass
from freshman forward Phil Di
Giuseppe and skated the width of

the ice to find the perfect angle,
beating Summerhays stick-side.
It was his second goal in as many
series and gave Michigan a lead
that it would not surrender.
Impressively, the Wolverines
stole the show on the power play
over the weekend against the
CCHA's best team on the man
advantage.
And by working hard around
the net, they began earning
those close-quarter goals that
weren't possible with opponents
blocking shot after shot in the
past few weeks.
Nobody is rushing to declare
the Michigan power play "back,"
but this weekend showed some
organization from the unit after
weeks of two-minute spans of
chaos.


Wrestlers pull away in final two
duals against Central Michigan

THE RIVALRY CONTINUES!
MICHIGAN.
, VS
MICHIGAN STATE
Saturday, February 11, 2012 at 7:30 p.m.

By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan wrestling continues
to build upon its nearly century-
old legacy. On the mat where they
once wrestled stood the many
generations that represent that
tradition. It was Alumni Day on
Sunday, and Cliff Keen Arena
welcomed back its former wres-
tlers with open arms.
Many left Michigan to achieve
greater things, claiming titles as
All-Americans, national champi-,
ons and Olympians. But at heart,
they will always be Wolverines
and are always humbled in their
returns.
"It takes you right back. It's
been 30 years, but it's just like
I was here yesterday," said pro-
gram alum Jeff Henry (1977-78).
Henry expressed how
impressed he was with the cur-
rent No. 10 Michigan team and
its victory over Central Michigan.
The Wolverines were forced to
rally, but came out on top, 23-14,
in their last non-conference meet
of the season.
It was an ongoing battle after
the Chippewas managed to put
the first points on the board. But
Michigan won the next three
matches.
Following a 4-2 decision in the
133-pound category, fifth-year
senior Kellen Russell gave Michi-
gan a two-point lead with his per-
formance in the 141-pound bout.
It was a rematch of the Michi-
gan State Open championship
round from earlier in the season,
and Russell's opponent - sopho-
more Scott Mattingly - was seek-
ing revenge. It was neck and neck,
and Mattingly scored a three-
point near fall on Russell.
"I made a mistake, and that
happens," Russell said. "I knew
he couldn't hang with me on my
feet. I took him down pretty eas-
ily.",
Mattingly tried to take advan-
tage of Russell in the midst of a
scramble. But Russell was confi-
dent that he would take the win,
which he completed with a 12-9
final.
Following Russell's lead was

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Fifth-year senior Kellen Russell won a rematch against CMU's Scott Mattingly.

Eric Grajales. With three take-
downs off leg attacks and a two-
point tilt, Grajales earned a 12-4
major decision.
Grajales is consistently aggres-
sive on the mat, which might stem
from his choice of music right
before a match.
"(I'm) definitely psyching
myself up," Grajales said. "It's usu-
ally metal, something very fast-
paced and hard. I'm not the kind
of person that likes to be calm or
too relaxed before a match, I want
to be amped up."
Yet even after a win, Grajales
stays in that mode. As the major-
ity of his teammates sit in silence
while watching a match, Grajales
is right alongside the coaches
and spectators, yelling with both
excitement and fury.
"I've always been a very vocal
person," Grajales said. "I want
them to do just as well as I want
myself to do. ... It's hard not to
scream."
But even with thunderous
support, the Wolverines weren't
able to maintain a lead and twice
allowed Central Michigan to tie
up the score.
It came down to the final two
Wolverines - redshirt freshman
Max Huntley at 197 pounds and

redshirt junior heavyweight Ben
Apland - who each topped their
opponents.
Huntley stole the match with
four takedowns and 2:37 in rid-
ing time advantage, and Apland
clinched his win with a fall.
Coming into the meet, Apland
was ranked 14th and his Chippe-
wa opponent Peter Sturgeon 13th.
Apland gained momentum early in
the first period with a takedown
and accumulation of riding time.
At the sound of the whistle sig-
nifying the end of the second peri-
od, the referee called the fall on
Sturgeon at 5:00 flat. It was a mild
upset, but an upset nonetheless.
Had Apland lost with a deci-
sion, the meet would have ended
in a tie. Luckily for Michigan, that
was not the case.
"I felt just good," Apland said.
"I was getting a lot of attacks in
practice."
The team ended the dual on a
highhnote but now looksdahead to
finish the season the same way.
In the upcoming weeks, the
team has four Big Ten duels with
nationally ranked teams.
"Those duels are going to be a
dogfight," said Michigan coach
Joe McFarland. "We just gotta
keep doing what we do."
