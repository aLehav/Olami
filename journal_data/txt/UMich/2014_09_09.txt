Faculty express desire
for increased admin.
transparency
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
University President Mark
Schlissel's introductions contin-
ued Monday at this semester's first
meeting of the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs.
Though the University presi-
dent doesn't regularly participate
in SACUA proceedings, the com-
mittee typically invites a senior
administrator or notable campus
figure to speak at each of its formal
meetings. Monday's main focus, at
Schlissel's request, was discussing
faculty concerns that the adminis-
tration could work to mitigate,
Voicing a need for the adminis-
trationto increase itstransparency,
SACUA members asked Schlissel's
opinion regarding where to draw
the line between faculty gover-
nance and the jurisdiction of the
central administration.
Schlissel said faculty should
largely take ownership of academic
areas of governance, but conceded
that responsibility for non-aca-
demic areas is more ambiguous.
"The facultyneeds to be involved
and consulted early in the develop-

ment of administrative policies ...
but at the end of the day, adminis-
trative things are administrative
things," Schlissel said.
Schlissel said he has made it
his goal to reach out to all faculty
in some form to make them feel
fully represented in the Univer-
sity "machinery," and to allow the
administration to garner more
"good input."
Comparative Literature Prof.
Silke-Maria Weineck, a SACUA
member, said quality faculty-
administration collaboration
would hinge on what Schlissel's
interpretation ofconsultingfaculty
will look like.
Last year, the University's
launch of the Shared Services Cen-
ter -which willultimatelyrelocate
more than 100 department-level
staff to a centralbuildingnear Wol-
verine Tower - prompted vocal
criticism from faculty and staff
who questioned the administra-
tion's transparency and equity in
craftingthe plan.
Schlissel provided a few sugges-
tions, including faculty represen-
tation in meetings with the deans
of the University's colleges and
schools.
The idea was well received,
especially in the scope of a com-
ment from Dentistry Prof. Rex Hol-
land, another SACUA member.

Artist adds to
list of prominent
rappers to hit A2
By ADAM THEISEN
Daily MusicEditor
On Oct. 18, ScHoolboy Q will
join the growing list of hip-hop
stars who have played shows at

Hill Auditorium.
With Chance the Rapper
and 2 Chainz hitting the venue
earlier in 2014, not to mention
Earl Sweatshirt and Danny
Brown both playing The Blind
Pig in 2013, the bar is set high
for Q. But, just as the chart per-
formance of his number-one
album Oxymoron cemented his
place as one of the most excit-
ing young rappers in the game

today, the fall show at Hill will
be a chance to win the hearts
of a Michigan crowd that has
already seen their share of
impressive concerts from top
hip-hop acts.
Big Ticket Productions, a stu-
dent organization and concert
production group at the Univer-
sity, is responsible for bringing
ScHoolboy to Hill. Big Ticket
has had a hand in previous hip-

hop shows in Ann Arbor, includ-
ing J. Cole, Lupe Fiasco and
Chance the Rapper.
While Hill Auditorium has
seen musical legends ranging
as far back as Frank Sinatra,
all the way through The Beach
Boys, Bruce Springsteen and
Bob Marley in the late '70s,

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS
Fireside Cafe
opens after
renovations

Six-month project
creates new space
for North Campus
dwellers
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
North Campus just got a little
more appetizing.
Monday, the new Fireside Cafe
in Pierpont Commons opened its
doors after a six-month, $5.3 mil-
lion renovation. The project is
part of a series of Union renova-
tions, which are funded in part by
a $65-per-term student fee.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, is an outspo-
ken advocate for the renovations
and encouraged the University's
Board of Regents to approve the
projects in December 2013. At
the ceremony, Harper expressed
gratitude for the renovations and
joked about past critiques of the
North Campus cafe.
"When you've been here for a
while, like some of my colleagues,
this is the end of an annual 'Come
to North Campus and get beaten
up about how terrible the caf-
eteria is,' " Harper said. "I am
thrilled because it means that I
will not have to get that beating
this year."
Harper said the dining space is
a reflection of the hard work and
persistence of the many faculty
and staff members who recog-
nized the need for better student
dining options on North Campus.

"This celebration is not only
about the beautiful transforma-
tion of a facility, not only about
creating a welcoming place for
students, faculty and staff,"
Harper said. "We have just been
doggone determined that we
would have a facility here worthy
of our students and our commu-
nity. And I think we have man-
aged to do that, in spite of hard
economic times."
In addition to new fireplaces,
the renovated common area
includes an updated seating area
and more windows to showcase a
scenic view.
There are also several new
options for the hungry students
who find themselves on North
Campus, including dine-in and
to-go options to accommodate
those with busy schedules.
For example, the Maize Blaze
will feature unique, made-to-
order items, while the Hearth
will serve oven-baked pizza,
sandwiches and other baked
entrdes. Other options include
the "Greens. Grains. Soups."
salad bar, as well as Flare, which
is staffed by a rotation of local
restaurants throughout the week.
Before the project began, a
group of faculty, staff and stu-
dents came together to discuss
theirgoals for the space. Members
from the student organization
Building a Better Michigan and
the Pierpont Commons Board of
Representatives played a signifi-
cant role inthe project's planning,
according to Pierpont Commons
Director Michael Swanigan.

views on'blue

Great Lakes generally
viewed as economic
resource for state
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Over the past several years, fol-
lowing in the footsteps of a decade-
long push for environmental
restoration, the idea of using the
Great Lakes a driver of Michigan's
economy has culminated in a sig-
nificant amount of political action at
state and federal levels.
Under the direction of a 2007 Act
of Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers is currently conducting a
long-term study of invasive species
in the Great Lakes and the Missis-
sippi River Basin. U.S. Rep. Gary
Peters (D-Bloomfield Township)
has made the economic impact of
the Great Lakes a focal point of his
senatorial campaign through his
Great Lakes Jobs Tour.
"From a political perspective, it's
a good issue to pick up," said Jenni-
fer Read, director of the University's
Water Center and a former member
of the Great Lakes Commission. "It's
not just the environment, but it's
closely tied to our economy in the
region. A strong and healthy ecosys-
tem, we've demonstrated, is reflect-
ed in a strong economy."
Recently released survey results
from CLOSUP, the Center for Local,
State, and Urban Policy within the
Ford School of Public Policy, found
that at the local level the concept
of a "blue economy" has been well

Panel of varsity
coaches, leading
academics gives
advice to students
By ARIANA ASSAFF
Daily StaffReporter
To celebrate the Fall 2014
LSA Theme Semester, a panel
of academics and coaches
discussed achievement, hap-
piness and even facial hair to
more than 50 students and
rising professionals Monday
night in Rackham Auditorium.
The theme, "Sport in the
University," combines cours-
es in several disciplines as
a means of exploring and
researching the many facets
of athletics. The panel, con-
sisting of the University's
men's basketball coach and
women's gymnastics coach, a
linguistics professor and two

administrators, discussed the
theme's aim.
English Prof. Anne Curzan,
an organizer of the Theme
Semester, outlined the goal of
the project: to blend the cur-
ricular and the co-curricular
to look at the subject of sports
from several different per-
spectives.
To survey from academics
and coaches, Curzan moderat-
ed the event, posing questions
to gauge advice from the pan-
elists on how to achieve suc-
cess and - more importantly
- how to respond to failure.
Perhaps the most comi-
cal answer was given by Phil
Deloria, LSA associate dean
of undergraduate education:
"Shave off the scraggly beard
and never grow it back."
Deloria's and others' more
serious suggestions were rel-
evant to all students, including
those who may not have clear-
ly defined academic paths.
Deloria made the point that

experiential goals, though
their outcome may not be as
identifiable as those of more
concrete goals, are still an
important part of the learning
process.
"No experience is ever lost
or wasted," he said. "You just
haven't used it yet."
Women's gymnastics coach
Bev Plocki said because ath-
letics in general are so perfec-
tionistic, there can always be
an element of failure. Howev-
er, to her, the most important
element of "failure" is learning
to overcome it and try again.
Men's basketball coach
John Beilein called failure
"fertilizer for growth." As
perhaps the most well known
panelist to the student body,
Beilein led the men's basket-
ball teams through successful
seasons in 2013 and 2014, fin-
ishing as the national finalist
and the Elite Eight, respec-
tively, in the March Madness

Presidential
candidate breaks
pledge to Kerry
KABUL, Afghanistan(AP) -
Afghan presidential candidate
Abdullah Abdullah said Mon-
day that he will not accept the
expected official results of the
election, breaking a pledge he
made to the U.S. secretary of
state and injecting new tension
into an already drawn-out polit-
ical process.
Appearing tired and ner-
vous, Abdullah told a nationally
televised news conference that
he believes he won both times
Afghans voted this year - in
April and again in a June runoff.
He accused election authorities
of violating the desires of voters
by ignoring widespread fraud
and preparing to declare his
opponent, former Finance Min-
ister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai,
the winner.
"We were the winners of the
election," said Abdullah. "We
are the winners of the election
based on the real vote of the
people."
Abdullah's announcement
effectively pre-empts the coun-
try's election commission,
which is expected to announce
the second-round results later
this week following a weekslong
audit process to weed out the
many fraudulent ballots cast.
The winner would succeed the
outgoing president, Hamid Kar-
zai.
Abdullah and Ghani
Ahmadzai had both pledged to
Secretary of State John Kerry
during a July visit to the country
to abide by the audit's results.
The two also agreed to plans to
form a government of national
unity with participation of the
losing side.
That second agreement also
remains in peril. The two candi-
dates met face-to-face on Mon-
day, but Abdullah said the talks
are deadlocked over how pow-
erful to make a newly created

position of government chief
executive.
Kerry made a second visit to
Afghanistan in August in a bid
to keep the peace. The two can-
didates then pledged to set an
inauguration before the end of
that month, a date which sailed
by without a hint of finality to
the now five-month-long elec-
tion process.
In Washington, U.S. State
Department spokeswoman Jen
Psaki said that Kerry had spo-
ken with both candidates on
Monday.
"In our view, the audit pro-
cess is still ongoing,"' Psaki
said. "Under the supervision of
the United Nations, I think it
was confirmed that part of the
process had been completed.
There's more that needs to be
done. Dr. Abdullah has indi-
cated consistently that he will
abide by the constitution, and so
we're continuing to work with
the candidates to determine
how we can resolve this moving
forward."
Abdullah's latest statement
came one day before Afghans cel-
ebrate anationalholidaytohonor
a former militia commander,
Ahmad Shah Massoud, a hero
in the country's north, Abdul-
lah's power base. Massoud was
killed two days before the Sept.
11, 2001, attacks in the U.S., and
Abdullah asked the country for
calm on Tuesday and told sup-
porters not to mix their emotions
over the election and Massoud.
A spokesman for Abdullahhad
said over the weekend that "radi-
cals" in his camp could foment
violence if he is not given a share
of power.
On Monday, former Afghan
defense minister Abdul Rahim
Wardak said he believes violence
could break out.
"I think there is the possibil-
ity," Wardak said in an interview.
"There are some countries that
want that. Both to our east and
west," he said, in apparent refer-
ences to neighbors Pakistan and
Iran.
The U.S. has continued to

press Abdullah and Ghani
Ahmadzai to form a national
unity government, and President
Barack Obama spoke with both
on Saturday. Though Abdullah
said the political process has
reached a deadlock, he did not
say he was pulling out of talks or
that the idea of a national unity
government was dead.
Kabir Ranjbar, a member of
Ghani Ahmadzai's election team,
essentially blamed Abdullah for
being a poor loser and said he
should accept the outcome of
the vote given that the audit was
aided and observed by the U.N.
and the international commu-
nity.
Abdullah - who placed sec-
ond in Afghanistan's 2009 vote
after what he alleged was mas-
sive vote fraud in favor of Karzai
- did not say what he planned to
do next. He said he would make a
decision "based on consultations
withthe people."
Afghan election officials
under international supervision
have finished recounting more
than 8 million ballots cast in the
June 14 runoff after preliminary
results showed GhaniAhmadzai
well ahead of Abdullah.
Both candidates had teams of
observers watching the recount
until Abdullah - who believed
his complaints of fraud were
not being listened to - pulled
his observers. At the request of
the U.N., Ghani Ahmadzai then
did the same.
The international community
had hoped for a smooth transi-
tion of power as most foreign
forces withdraw by the end of
the year. The U.S. wants the next
Afghan president to quickly sign
a security agreement to allow
some 10,000 troops to remain
to assist with counterterrorism
operations and training Afghan
forces.
Karzai, the only president
Afghanistan has known since
the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that
ousted the Taliban, has refused
to sign the accord. Both candi-
dates have said they would sign
it; one must be sworn in first.

"So anytimeyouhaveweather like
that it's going to help suppress fire
activity."
The fire, which had burned
about 4 square miles of timber-
land, wasn't threatening any
buildings. The park remained
open, but some campsites were
closed.
About 120 firefighters and 11
aircraft fought the blaze, which
may have erupted from embers of
a fire sparked by lightning several
weeks ago, officials said.
SAN FRANCISCO
Federal court hears
arguments over gay,
marriage's impact
A federal appeals court in San
Francisco waded again into the
debate over the constitutionality
of gay marriage, with attorneys for
both sides arguing over whether
 legalizing it would harm children.
The three judges on the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals - two
of whom have ruled in previ-
ous cases in favor of gay rights
- reserved many of their most
pointed questions at the defend-
ers of state bans in Idaho, Nevada
and Hawaii.
Judge Marsha Berzon
appeared critical of the attorney
defending two of the bans, say-
ing he was sending a message
that families headed by same-sex
couples were "second-rate."

MONROVIA, Liberia
WHO says Liberia
will see thousands
of new Ebola cases
The United States and Brit-
ain will send medical equipment
and military personnel to help
contain West Africa's Ebola out-
break, as the World Health Orga-
nization warned Monday that
many thousands of new infec-
tions are expected in Liberia in
the coming weeks.
The current Ebola outbreak
is the largest on record. It has
spread from Guinea to Sierra
Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and
Senegal and killed more than
2,000 people. An "exponential
increase" in new cases is expect-
ed in the hardest-hit countries in
coming weeks, the U.N. health
agency warned.
"As soon as a new Ebola treat-
ment facility is opened, it imme-
diately fills to overflowing with
patients, pointing to a large but
previously invisible caseload,"
WHO said in a statement about
the situation in Liberia. "Many
thousands of new cases are
expected in Liberia over the com-
ing three weeks."

The findings come from
data collected in the fall 2013
edition of the Michigan Pub-
lic Policy Survey, a biannu-
ally administered study that
asks local government officials
across the state about a variety
of topics.
According to the survey,
99 percent of local leaders -
which the study classified as a
mix of city managers, mayors,
township officials and county
administrators and board chairs
- agree that the Great Lakes
overall are an important eco-
nomic resource for Michigan.
Regarding the lakes' status as
a local economic resource, this
sentiment was most strongly
rooted in coastal jurisdictions,
with 71 percent of leaders say-
ing they felt strongly that the

am glad that we have this for the
community and that it's getting
such positive feedback."
Swanigan also said he appre-
ciates that the cafe offers longer
hours and a more visible dining
area so students are more aware
of all that North Campus has to
offer.
Isaiah Bailey, vice chair of
the Pierpont Commons Board
of Representatives, echoed
Swanigan's sentiments, saying
he is proud of the collaborative
versity, in terms of getting
the students involved and
bringing shows that would
unite the University and get
the students excited," said
LSA senior, Bo Bradarich,
co-president of Big Ticket.
"We've really been trying to

denouncing what they saw as

called for bonus information to
be made readily available to the

Holland said since admin-

with public money, information
about bonuses should be public
as well.

Prof. David Smith, another
SACUA member, said he doesn't
see a reason to keep administra-
tive bonuses private.
"They earn it; they deserve it
fine," he said. "But I haven't
heard a good argument that
says why they shouldn't (make
bonuses public)."
lakes are an important eco-
nomic resource for their local
community. However, this num-
ber dropped sharply 10 miles
inland, with only 21 percent of
local leaders feeling strongly
that the lakes are an impor-
tant economic resource locally.
Among local leaders more than
40 miles inland, the 58 percent
of local officials disagree that
there are valuable local econom-
ic benefits from the Lakes to be
had on a local level.
Tom Ivacko, CLOSUP's pro-
gram manager and admin-
istrator, said the differing
assessments of the lakes' impor-
tance by location, especially
with such wide variation, was
surprising.
"We expected to see much
stronger connections between
local governments and the Great
Lakes," Ivacko said. "When you
think about Michigan, you think
about the Great Lakes. They're
such an important part of our
history, our self-identity, that to
see this relationship weaken so
Beilein also explained how to
maintain drive in light ofachieve-
ment. One point that was touched
on several times throughout the
panel was that it is much easier to

know how to improve when one
has not met a goal.
"It's a good feeling to have suc-
cess when you know you've got-
ten it the right way," he said.

"I think most importantly
we had a group that was will-

a few meetings, we even got to

a smooth process. It definitely

Bailey also emphasized how

dents to stay involved in the

After making his first impres-

overshadowed by his label-

ically-acclaimed smash, good

ScHoolboy returned with Feb-
ruary's Oxymoron and its run
Not posting total salaries,
Smith argued, could "give the
appearance of something to
hide. If you're going t put it out,
then put out the truth."
Schlissel said Smith's logic
was sound, but added that some
of the money that composes sal-
aries cannot be made not public,
such as that of the University's
clinical faculty, who may be
paid for the medical services
they offer. He said the Univer-
sity is in competition with other
health care providers and it is
important for the institution to
retain its clinical staff.
The conversation regard-
ing salaries ultimately segued
into a larger talk about making
the University a place where
quickly in such a short distance,
we were pretty surprised by
that."
When asked who should be
responsible for protecting the
Great Lakes, local leaders listed
state government first, followed
by the U.S and Canadian federal
governments, the private sector,
individuals, and then local gov-
ernment last.
Ivacko said while this finding
was surprising, it was tempered
by several other factors, namely
the fact that even though local
government is listed last, 67 per-
cent of respondents still said it
should have some responsibility.
"That's still a pretty strong
majority; it's just much lower
than state governments or
the U.S and Canadian fed-

he said. "But still, more than

Schlissel asked SACUA mem-

This request aligned with
Schlissel's greater goal of mak-

pursuits. Part of this endeavor,
he said, will require the Univer-

Here, the result was more

local leaders supporting 10 of

Ivacko said the reportdemon-
strated that overall, many local
leaders understand the benefits
of a "blue economy for the entire
state," but not necessarily for
their own communities.
"For any stakeholders who
are trying to establish more of a
blue economy within the state,
I think these survey results are
not necessarily a wakeup call,
but they highlight that there's
a lot of work to do," he said. "If
other folks that are pushing for
these kinds of economic ties had

as "all the usual stuff that stu-

He said that the best thing stu-

important dates from syllabi, and

preparation should go into each
deadline.

An applicable education

oving homes is one of my least
favorite activities. Don't get me
wrong, my inner
neuroticism fights with me
every year because moving
means positively placating
the neurosis: cleaning out
old clothes and giving away
those articles that somehow
manage to no longer see the
light of day from the depths MARA
of my closet. It's just that in
college we have to do it too LEVINE
often, moving out in May
and moving back in during
the last week of August. For most of us, this
meansthe same suitcasesbeingstuffedwith the
same sweats, Michigan shirts, winter boots and
going-out clothes (what else do we wear in Ann
Arbor, anyway?). But the end of this summer
brought a particularly heinous twinge to my
packing ritual as I packed not for Ann Arbor, but
for Washington, D.C. Business suits and heels
took up the space that is usually occupied by
leggings and gymshoes.
Like several other political science students
this semester, I will be participating in
Michigan in Washington, interning for the
government and crying every Saturday because
I'mnotintownfor footballseason.Myacademic
internship will find me at the U.S. Department
of Justice Environment and Natural Resources
Division, and my adventuresome spirit will find
me wandering around after work, seeing every
museum possible and taking more pictures
than myphone can hold.
Applying to work at the DOJ was quite the
ordeal.Security background checks to work for
the federal government are extensive. Let's just
say answering the questions about every place
I'd ever lived was the easiest part in a litany of
brain-scratching - but that got me excited for
what is _to come. As an intern my duties will..
require me to view hearings on the Hill about
environmental issues and report back to my
office, along with other legal research chores.
This internship matches what I want to do as a
career in the future.
Getting to the background check stage
wasn't possible without a long and rigorous
application and interview phase, however, and
before my introductory classes for Michigan
in Washington last winter, I was frightened to
start this process. After all, I knew nothing at
all about applying for a government internship

or how to interview well. While I had plenty
of classroom experience, my job-seeking and
interview skills were lacking. To my surprise,
there are quite a few helpful hints that are
known by members of the Career Counseling
team and others with experience.
These hints on how to successfully get a job,
internship or apply to graduate school should
not be confined just to those who ask. Instead
of having to take a class for distribution on
campus at the University that is completely
unrelated to our majors, such as the
quantitative reasoning requirement for social
science majors, I propose that students should
be required to take a class that is meaningful
and applicable to our lives. This class would
prepare us for graduate school, internships
or jobs in our specific fields by teaching us
necessary interview and application skills,
and therefore would be much more beneficial
than wasting our precious tuition dollars
on classes we don't even want to take (like
calculus as an Anthropology major).
My suggestion does not come as a total
shot in the dark. Historically, apprenticeships
were the only way that people learned a
profession and were thus prepared to enter the
job market. Granted, I am not asking that we
return to the 1700s. Rather, I am suggesting
that students who have decided their field of
interest be asked to look at all the possibilities
for employment or further schooling with
others in their major in a classroom setting.
With the skills garnered in a class like this, all
of the guesswork would be taken out of how to
properly applyfor a competitive job and how to
interview well, depending on your field.
Othersmaysaythateliminatingadistribution
requirement would make a less well-rounded
student, but these people would forget that
certain undergraduates are already allowed to
bypass distribution requirements. An example
of this is the College of Engineering kids who
aren't required to take a language unless they
want to. Based on this logic, why should those
people studying the social sciences be required
to take quantitative reasoning? A class giving
us tools to advance our careers and look at all
possibilities would be more worthwhile than
an unrelated distribution requirement, and
would give us the skills to succeed and compete
in an ever-changing job market.

An opportunity for the center

The current political
atmosphere of congressional
gridlock and polarization
leaves little room for the ide-
ological center and its ideas.
However, intense partisan-
ship and the dysfunction it
has caused may actually pro-
vide centrists with an oppor-
tunity to make their voices
heard. With congressional
approval ratings and pro-
ductivity near historic lows,
pragmatists have the oppor-
tunity to appeal to the Amer-
ican electorate by providing
policy solutions that could
satisfy Americans' desire for
a functional legislature.
Even though hyper-par-
tisanship makes it appear
that there is nothing in com-
mon between the left and
right, there is in fact common
ground between both sides.
For example, both President
Barack Obama and former
Republican U.S. Rep. Newt
Gingrich have said that the
U.S. corporate tax rate, the
highest in the developed
world, should be lowered.

Even though Gingrich and
Obama are an unlikely team,
their agreement reveals there
is still some consensus on
how to reform the tax code,
a subject that is normally
left untouched due to grid-
lock. More recently, U.S.
Republican Sen. Rand Paul
and Former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton issued
similar statements regarding
the unrest in Ferguson, Mis-
souri, further demonstrating
that there, are commonali-
ties between politicians who
usually don't agree. There is
room for compromise, but
there is currently no voice
to advocate for it. Centrists
can fill this void by proposing
policies that are widely sup-
ported, but would normally
not pass due to partisanship.
Although pragmatism
and compromise may sound
appealing, Democrats and.
Republicans must first
change the way they nego-
tiate and interact with one
another. Primarily, the lack
of bipartisan friendships in

Congress today is not con-
ducive for negotiation, and
former congressmen have
actually lamented the decline
in bipartisan friendships and
expressed how they are cru-
cial for compromise. Nev-
ertheless, centrists are in
an advantageous position to
encourage bipartisan friend-
ships. This will allow one
side to better understand
the perspective of the other
and will create an environ-
ment for more productive
negotiation. Whether it is
leading the charge to pass a
tax compromise, or encour-
aging bipartisan friendships,
centrists have the opportu-
nity to increase pragmatism
and effective policymaking
in Congress. Through these
efforts, pragmatists can ful-
fill the lack of strong lead-
ership in Congress and can
work to rebuild the American
public's trust in government.
Daniel Karr is an
LSA sophomore.

Moving back has been great
after a long and busy summer. I was
thrilled to see my friends again,
excited to meet my new residents in
South Quad and both nostalgic and
ecstatic to start my last year here.
But new years and people also bring
new problems, and unfortunately
Labor Day evening was a testament
to that.
Walking back to my dorm after a
nice night with my family, we were
approached by a man who appeared
to have been drinking quite a bit. He
asked my father for some money,
and he politely declined and kept
walking. The man became angry
and started shouting after us as
we walked away, including the
comment, "Give me that towel on
your head!"
We continued walking down
the street and were very close to
my dorm when a truck of students
drove past with the windows rolled
down, I assume to enjoy the pleasant
weather as we were. As they passed
us, a boy in the back seat stuck his
head out and yelled, "I love Ann
Arbor, towel head!"
Twice. In less than 10 minutes.
Even as I write this, my anger,
and also helplessness, from last
night return. There was no point in
engaging in conversation in either
scenario, but the fear that entered all
of us makes me wish we could have.

Towel Head
A few minutes after the truck drove
away, there was another truck that
pulled up next to us while we were
walking. I'm sure we all thought
it, but my mom is the one who
whispered it to me once we realized
it wasn't the case, "I thought they
were coming back for more."
Living in fear is not something
that I was taught. Rather, I was
taught to hold my head high
and practice my faith fearlessly,
regardless of the consequences. This
is what Sikhs have done throughout
history and, though it has led to
bloodshed and sacrifice many times,
it is what we will continue to do.
Yet there are many cases of blatant
discrimination, bias, and exclusion
that could be stopped, and that
will help prevent these instances of
misinformation and ignorance.
Each timea Sikh is stopped by the
TSA for a secondary screening in an
airport, it shows the people around
them that there is potentially
something to fear under a turban,
behind a beard or beneath dark skin.
Each time a Sikh is not allowed to
serve in the United States military
or their local law enforcement due
to his or her articles of faith, it tells
them that their love for this country
is not equal to others'. And when
FIBA, the international basketball
governing body, decided that they
needed more time to decide whether

or not Sikhs can play basketball
with their dastaars (turbans), it sent
the message that it is allowable to
exclude individuals for no reason
but the fact that they look different.
At this point in our nation's
history,it is unacceptable that weare
still allowing certain individuals to
face hate crimes and ignorance with
no justice. The small messages that
are sent on a day-to-day basis can
create the long-standing message
that a turban is dangerous or Sikhs
are a threat. As a Wolverine, seeing
a practicing Sikh with a turban on
one of our athletic teams would be
a dream of mine, but it might not
happen since he or she could not go
on to play professionally.
When I walk down State Street
or across the Diag, I want to know

Heartburn will ruin your night.
Karen 0 goes solo

Recorded sevenyears
ago, 'Crush Songs' a
melancholic affair
By GIBSON JOHNS
Daily Arts Writer
When the lead singer of a
band ventures out on her own,,
there is an unsaid expectation
that her solo
material
should present
a departure in Crush Songs
sound, feel and
emotion from Karen 0
her previous Cult Records
releases.
Ideally, solo
efforts should offer up a fresh
enough approach in order
to back-up her decision to
(temporarily or permanently)
leave the rest of her bandmates
behind.
YeahYeahYeahsfrontwoman
Karen O's debut solo album.
Crush Songs does exactly that;
it's stripped back, melancholy
softness isa drasticallydifferent
sound than the explosive, post-
punk rock that the Yeah Yeah
Yeahs have reliably produced
over the past 13 years. The
15-track album falls more in line
with O's previously released

solo material like "The Moon
Song" from the Spike Jonze's
2013 film, "Her" (interestingly,
O recorded Crush Songs in the
period following her break-up
with Jonze in 2006 and 2007).
Though O's voice works well
in this new setting, much of
Crush Songs feels inexplicably
unfinished. You're often left
wanting more from a song,
which is perhaps the point.
After all, the album is about
crushes, the kind that leave
you unfulfilled and questioning
what comes next. And on
occasion, the effect works. The
sparse production forces the
listener to get a better grasp
on the lovelorn lyrics that,
more often than not, serve as
relatable quips about what it
feels like to be wrapped-up in
the prospect of a love that might
never come to fruition. On
"Body," O sings about stepping
back from loving someone by
taking some time to work on
yourself over tongue-clicking
and christmas bells, provoking
the listeners to reflect on their
own experiences with having
an unspoken crush.
Despite some bright
moments, too much of Crush
Songs leaves you feeling
unsatisfied. The entire album
runs just over 25 minutes, with

some of the tracks not even
reaching the one-minute mark.
And for a debut album from a
woman who has made a career
out of producing fulfilling,
genre-bending music with the
rest of her band, it comes off
as lazy even if she's trying to
be consciously concise. "NYC
Baby," one of the album's most
promising tracks, ends after 58
seconds and feels as though it's
missing a verse or two.
As much as one must respect
O's new direction and sound,
it's difficult not to question her
commitment to producing an
album that feels complete and
well-rounded. The fact that she
recorded the album seven years
ago doesn't help her case either.
For 0, the form that these Crush
Songs take might reflect their
subject matter - crushes that
leave you longing for more,
unsure of where things stand
or are unusually sad - but in
the end, this approach doesn't
work. The album's strongest
moments, like the ethereal
first single "Rapt" and the
charmingly repetitive "Day Go
By," prove that there's potential
in Karen O's solo efforts, but
there simply aren't enough
fulfilling tracks like these to
save Crush Songs fr6m feeling
hastily thrown together.

For The Daily
Hardened by life on the
road but motivated by many
high-profile praises, Roadkill
Ghost Choir
is a young
band trying
to figure out
who or what In
it wants to be. Roadkill
This Floridian Ghost Choir
group's first
full-length Greatest Hiss
debut, In
Tongues, is best described as
an amalgamation of sounds
and influences held together
by talented musicianship and
noticeably deep lyricism.
Following its nationwide tour
with Band of Horses and stops at
this summer's most important
festivals - Governor's Ball,
Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza -
the band has established itself
as one to be watched. Over the
past two years of touring, the
band has undergone obvious
changes in its sound. Perhaps
hardened by its time on the road,
or just distracted by different
influences, the band has
transitioned from a folk, banjo
heavy 2012 EP, Quiet Light,
into a more indie rock feel. An
obvious change has occurred
in the band's debut album that
gears it towards back-to-back
tours and sold out venues. In
fact, it is clear through this
album that these kids have just
started to scratch the surface of
their smorgasbord of a sound.

a breath of fresh air.

the success and popularity of

es the first season's dramatic
highs. The game even ran bet-
ter than its predecessor; I only
experienced a few noticeable
instances of freezing and slow-
down.
The game wasn't perfect,
though. I had two major prob-
lems with it: First, I felt that
many of the dialogue choices
didn't make as much sense
in this one - in other words,
I often felt as though there
was an obvious thing to say
but there wasn't a dialogue
choice that let me say it. I don't
remember having that prob-
lem in "Season One." Second,
Telltale did not live up to their
promise that the choices made
in the "Season One" DLC chap-
ter "400 Days" would mean-
ingfully impact Season 2. The
changes these choices bring
about are so minor you may not
even notice them.
This game was so heart-
wrenchingly emotional,
though, that I find these prob-
lems melting away from my
reflection on the game. Telltale
really has something special on
its hands here; their last sev-
eral games have all been of an
extraordinarily high quality.
Color me very excited-for its
"Game of Thrones" adaptation
to be released later this year.
If you played "The Walking
Dead: Season One," you have no
excuse for not playing "Season
Two." If you didn't play "Sea-
son One," play "Season One."
And then play its wonderful
sequel.

GREATEST HISS

"Are you down for a tour of Emo Lake?"
songs aren't even all that good.
But long-haired and bushy-
tailed, the band has given each
song a redeeming quality that
keeps the average listener
intrigued and the avid fan
obsessed. There is no specific
theme to latch onto in listening
to the album, but perhaps this
is a result of its odd mixture
of influences that range from
Radiohead to Cormac McCarthy
to My Morning Jacket. Andrew
Shepard, with a voice similar
to that of fellow Floridian Tom
Petty, stars as the songwriter
of the band. Providing a
poetic backbone to the album,
Shepard's voice and lyricism
acts as the sole constant.
The album is kick-started
by jam songs. "Slow Knife,"
the album's most popular
single, is reminiscent of My
Morning Jacket's "Circuital."
The inconsistent rise and
fall of rhythms and sounds
becomes clear here, when two
songs later the boys move their
listeners into more electronic
explorations. "A Blow to the
Head," for example, is a six-

and-a-half-minute jam session
that warrants a comparison to
Radiohead. While Shepard's
scratchy vocals belt "Don't talk
me down / I'm trying to see
the stars," a steady guitar and
drum set accompanies. It is
undeniably the best song on the
album. The transition from the
slow, more acoustic "I Could See
Everything" into a synthesized
yet guitar-heavy, steady rock
song, "No Enemy" is confusing
but excellent. Each song
individually possesses notable
moments of greatness.
There is no telling where this
band is headed. Dabbling 'in
multiple genres and influences
from song to song, it's easy to
understand why Roadkill Ghost
Choir's fan base ranges from
the hipsters of Bonnaroo to the
criticsofRollingStone. Itssound
is Americana yet universal.
It surprises listeners with its
synthesized bits but suppresses
them with a steady steel guitar
and singer-songwriter style
lyricism. If this band were to
have a college major, it would be
indefinitely undecided.

Taking the Kiss
bassist to task
on controversial
quotation
By BRIAN BURLAGE
Daily ARTS WRITER
Several years ago, I took a trip
with my family to visit my grand-
parents in central Ohio. I was
probably nine or ten years old at
the time, and all I could think
about were the impending spoils
- limitless supplies of chocolate
milk, powdered sugar donuts, a
whole week of staying up late -
that seemed to become a reality
only when I visited my grandpar-
ents. We spent the long summer
days outside at amusement parks
or, when the humidity was too
overbearing, in the coolvastinte-
riors of shopping malls. At night
when the fireflies transposed
constellations on my grandpar-
ents' front lawn, my brother and
I would run and fumble over
each other to try to catch them.
That trip was, for many rea-
sons, one of the last trips we
took to visit my grandparents
there. While the easygoing pulse
of everything throughout that
trip sticks out in my memory, I
remember one evening in par-
ticular. My grandpa was an artist
(among other things, a pianist,
too) and we spent one evening
together in his kitchen, where
I asked him to paint whatever
images would float through my
mind and he, with marvelous
grace, would paint them. I asked
him to paint moon-dwelling
hockey players, cotton candy
flowers, pirates dressed in foot-
ball uniforms, mythical crea-
tures (on sea and land), knights
fighting samurais, and he would
paint them all.
It was somewhat of an artistic
ritual for my grandpa, whenever
he painted, to have music playing
in the background. That was how
I learned about many great art-
ists, classical and contemporary
alike. However, on that particu-
lar evening I heard The Beach
Boys for the firsttime. Brian Wil-
son had just released Smile (this
was 2004) and the song "Surf's
Up" played for what seemed like
an eternity. In light of the deeply
imaginative work that my grand-
father was putting in front of my
nonbelieving eyes, I registered
"Surf's Up" as a song with limit-
less capacity. Of course, I didn't
understand the song's technical
value, its contextual significance
or where it stood in Wilson's
anthology. I wouldn't have been
able to articulate my apprecia-
tion of its rearing melody, instru-
mental spontaneity or simple,
chugging beat. But the song reso-
nated with the moment, and now,
looking back ten years later, the
two remain entwined.
When The Beach Boys
released Pet Sounds in 1966
(the loving parent of Smile), the
realm of rock music was still in
its infancy. The term "rock 'n'
roll" - in its stylistic sense -
was hardly a decade old. A mere
10 years had passed since Little
Richard and Chuck Berry suf-

fused African rhythmic sections
with New Orleans-centered R&B
and early rock structures. Songs
like "Maybellene" and "John-
ny B. Goode" had charted the
course for rock 'n' roll, but the
land ahead was vast and utterly
open. It contained within itself
an unimpeachable excitement
that was mirrored, perhaps for
the first time in contemporary
popular music, by the artistic
style that had started to breach
its territory. Pet Sounds was the
kind of the album that shook the
very ground upon which rock 'n'
roll stood, as it changed the sonic
landscape and diverged from the
direction of the rock genre. Its
diverse instrumentation, psy-
chedelic/baroque sound, eter-
nal sense of melody, quiet air of
sadness, strong sense of rhythm,
legendary rivalry with Rubber
Soul and streamline affection
(thanks to its mono recording)
make it a record of astounding
impact, one that shattered popu-
lar notions of the genre. Rock
music of the late '60s seemed, for
a time, completely unpredictable,

On strong defensive line,
Henry garners most praise

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
DailySportsEditor
Though it may be hard for
Michigan fans to see past the
31-0 trouncing
in South Bend, NOTEBOOK
there was some
encouraging play that came from
the Michigan football team -
most notably the defensive line.
The front seven allowed 54
yardson 3lcarries,butstruggled to
get to quarterback Everett Golson.
Notre Dame had its way with the
Michigan secondary - in what
Mattison called the best game in
Golson's career - but was unable
to get the ground game going.
Overall, the Wolverines (1-1)
were able to hold their own in the
trenches despite being on the field
for extended periods of time
Leadingthe way on the line was
redshirt sophomore defensive
tackle Willie Henry, whom
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
and defensive : coordinator Greg
Mattison had plenty of praise for
on Mndav

"The front seven, I thought,
did a pretty good job," Hoke said.
"From that standpoint, guys that
we rotated throughout in the
middle of the defense, I think
they were aggressive, I think they
were gap sound. I think Willie
had the most production of out all
of them.
"Willie might be the strongest
guy on the football team."
Even senior defensive end
Frank Clark, a former high school
teammate of Henry's, - joined
the lauding as he pointed to the
defensive tackle's development
and maturity as a player.
"Willie Henry is like a lot of
Michigan players that we've all
been fortunate enough to watch
over the years," Mattison said.
BUTT'S BACK: Lost in
Saturday's game was the return
of sophomore tight end Jake Butt.
After tearing his anterior cruciate
ligament during winter workouts
in February, Butt wasn't expected
back until Big Ten season.
"Jake's been working real hard
cin~ wP'vP h-n rainnsr" ca i

junior receiver Dennis Norfleet.
"Just to see him back, just to see
him happy again, you know, part
of the family. It really is a great
thing to have our brother back on
the team."
While he didn't play a big role
against Notre Dame - he mostly
served as a blocker - he'll resume
his role as the team's number one
tight end against Miami (Ohio)
this weekend.
"We think he's a very good
football player," Hoke said. "He
ended last year very well. He's
learned a lot, and he's one of the
guys who are on that leadership
council that isn't afraid, even
though he's a young guy, to
speak his mind and give his true
reactions and feelings."
Last season, Butt recorded 20
receptions for 235 yards and two
touchdowns - landing on ESPN's
All-Big Ten Freshman Team.
WORKING ON OFFENSE:
Fans were frustrated following
Michigan's first shutout in 365
games and,unsurprisingly, most of
the blame is falling on the offense.
"When you don't score and
you're the offensive coordinator
it's not good," said Michigan
offensive coordinator Doug
Nussmeier. "It's been a lot
of reflection ... and I take big
ownership inthis."
Quarterback Devin Gardner
struggled behind a porous
offensive line, but the issues
seemed to extend beyond that.
Banging his hand on the podium,
Hoke emphatically said the
team couldn't finish drives. And
his words ring true. Despite
outgaining the Fighting Irish and
winning the time of possession
by seven minutes, the Wolverines
never made it into the red zone.
But after moving the ball well
on the first two drives, through
a diverse array of play calling, .
Nussmeier's offense looked like
what it was - a newsystemstillin
its infancy stages."
Thereality mayhurt,especially
with a fifth-year senior at the
helm, but finding success against
big time opponents won't come
until Gardner and Nussmeier feel
comfortable together.

Frank Clark and the defense may be the strong suit of the Wolverines, but they've yet to record a turnover thus far.
Wanted: .turni~iov ers

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
offense was shut out for the first
time since 1984 on Saturday
against Notre Dame. It never even
reached the red zone. It crossed
midfield fewer than five times.
And for all its struggles, the
offense might not be to blame for
the shortcomings. The defense
could be at fault.
After two games, Michigan
has yet to record a turnover, and
in South Bend, it ended up giving
that extra chance for Fighting
Irish quarterback Everett
Golson to pass with ease or run
another play.
"The biggest thing for us
defensively is that we haven't
created any opportunities for
our offense," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke. "We haven't
created field position, we haven't
created anyturnovers, and that's
as much as anything.
"So what's that mean? We're
not hitting the quarterback
enough? Yeah some of it's that.
We're not forcing bad throws,
we're not playing tight enough
on those bad throws."
Turnovers, if anything,
help Michigan's defense spend
less than 33 minutes on the
field like it did against Notre

Dame. As the game wore on,
the Wolverines were bruised
and tired having to chase after
Golson or a wide receiver.
Time after time, Golson went
through his three-step drop and
fired the ball to a wide receiver,
who had plenty of space to
operate. And when Michigan
was playing tighter coverage, it
couldn't find a way to come away
with a pick.
"It's just something we
gotta work on, getting to the
quarterback and creating havoc
for that quarterback," said fifth-
year senior linebacker Jake Ryan.
"That run game we played pretty
well, but we also need to focus
on that passing game, getting
more blitzes in and getting more
guys to that quarterback is really
gonna create a new atmosphere
for him."
It's no secret the more
turnovers Michigan creates,
the more likely it is to score,
but that starts with how the
defense attacks the ball more
than anything.
"You gotta get to the ball and
have a knack for the ball where
it's at, what's going to happen
with it," Ryan explained. "We
gotta improve on that and take a
necessary step forward in order
to create turnovers."
The defense could help itself

get off the field aside from
turnovers. The Wolverines
managed to play well against the
run, limiting Notre Dame to 54
yards on 31 yards rushing. But it
couldn't escape when they were
forced to go to the air.
"They hit some really crucial
third downs in the first half,"
said defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison. "You have to stop
them on third downs to be a
good defense."
On third down from the one-
yard line, Michigan faced an
opportunity to get off the field
having surrendered only a field
goal. But then Golson found
wide receiver Amir Carlisle..
The Wolverines couldn't
escape third down on the
following defensive series,
either, allowing a 24-yard
touchdown pass.
"We've got to play better red
zone defense," Mattison said.
"That'sreallyhurtus.Allittakes
when you get down to the red
zone is one bad play, and-that's
gottenus."
And it will be another week
before Michigan plays a potent
offense when it "faces Utah,
but it's going to take all three
- turnovers, red zone defense
and escaping third downs - if
it hopes to avoid a repeat of
Saturday.

Daily Sports Editor
Mason Ferlic had it all, or so it
seemed.
He came to Michigan out
of Mounds Park Academy in
St. Paul, Minnesota as a state
champion in cross country, the
1,600-meter and the 3,200-meter
races. With an academic record
to match it, he was an Academic
All-State member, now majoring
in aerospace engineering.
Of course, when he got to Ann
Arbor, success wasn't as easy.
It wasn't until he found
his niche - the 3,000-meter
steeplechase - those familiar
rewards reappeared.
When Ferlic started at
Michigan in 2012, he had never
tried the steeplechase. When
he began his redshirt freshman
season in 2013, he still hadn't
tried it.
That season, he finished
13th in the event at the NCAA
Championships, earning second-
team All-American honors.
From there, everything 'took
off.
"It certainly seems like
it's going fast," Ferlic said.
"Just starting the event and
then reaching national-level
ability, but I think it's a work in
progress. Reaching those goals
and milestones, it's like, wow,
what else can I do? Two more
years here, we're looking at 2016
Rio Olympics. Where do things
end up?"
After the last two seasons, who
knows? Entering the 2013 season,
his Michigan resume was an
Athletic Academic Achievement
award and a fourth-place finish
in the 1,500-meter run as an
unattached runner.
Ferlic burst onto the scene by
winning his steeplechase debut in
early May his redshirt freshman
year. The following weekend -

his second career steeplechase
race - he finished fourth in
8:54.04. Then it was fourth again
at the NCAA East Preliminary
Rounds in 8:41.83, qualifying him
for the NCAA Championships.
And then, somehow, Mason
Ferlic was on the biggest stage in
college track - but in hindsight,
he wasn't quite ready for it yet.
In just his fourth career
steeplechase, Ferlic lost more
than five seconds from his
preliminary time, narrowly
missing the finals and settling
for second-team All-American
honors. He came back in 2014 an
entirely different runner.
"The steeple is an interesting
eventonthe track-it's kind oflike
the odd child," Ferlic said. "You're
running over some barriers that
don't move, and you have to jump
over a water pit. I tell some people
I do the steeplechase, and they're
like, 'What is that?"'
With that new mindset, he
was fully accustomed to his new
race. Ferlic won his only regular-
season steeplechase, but then
finished third at the Big Ten
Championships in 8:50.15, his
worst recorded time in a year.
But Ferlic* had been to the
NCAA Championships before. He
knew he was ready to take on the
challenge of a full championship
season, and a personal record in
the preliminary rounds clinched
a berth to his second NCAA
Championships.
Ferlic said in June that his
outlook changed before his second,
year in the race: from middling
to elite, hunter to hunted. With
a new mentality, he qualified for
the finals and finished fourth in
the country, earning first-team
All-American honors.
Afterward, a reporter asked
him what it was like to be the top
American collegiate finisher.
And that's when it sunk in:
Ferlic was one of the top distance

Mason Ferlic used a strong track season to transition to cross country season.

runners in the country.
"It was something thatI always
thought about, but never really
considered seriously," Ferlic said.
"I was still trying to achieve Big
Ten goals and national goals and
college. Professional distance
runner is still kind of a small
subset. You don'thear often about
how people make that jump."
Ferlic is prepared to do just
that. He has also become one
of the top runners on the men's
cross country team, finishing first
among all Michigan runners at
the Aug. 29 Michigan Open.
He stayed in Ann Arbor totrain
and work with a doctoral student
on research on North Campus.
The aerospace engineering major,
a self-described "kid who was
always building and blowing up
things in the backyard," worked
from design to manufacturing
on engineering auxiliary power

systems. Last season he earned
his second straight Academic All-
American award.
On the track, he finished ninth
in the steeplechase at the USA
Track and Field Championships
in late June. He also ran for Team
USA at the North American,
Central America and Caribbean
U-23 Championships. After what
was by far the longest competitive
season of his running career, a
career beyond college doesn't
seem far off.
Ferlic is willing but hesitant
to acknowledge this success. He
talked about staying humble,
because anything can happen, but
he knows his confidence is what
has gotten him this far.
He knows he's one of the top
collegiate athletes in the country,
and he doesn't plan on slowing
down: It's all coming together for
Mason Ferlic.
