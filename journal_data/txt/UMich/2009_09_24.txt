If proposal passes
state legislature,
some students won't
get scholarship
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
In a 4-2 vote yesterday, a joint
conference committee of the
Michigan Legislature decided
to cut funding for the Michigan
Promise Scholarship program as
a way to help trim the state's pro-
jected $2.8 billion deficit for next
year.
Some 96,000 students in the
state receive money from the
scholarship, which was signed
into law by Democratic Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm in 2006. The aid,
whichstudents attainbypassing a
certain mark on a merit examina-
tion given in high school, grants
students between $500 to $4,000
in total over four years to help pay
tuition,
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the Ann Arbor
campus currently has 6,096 stu-
dents eligible to receive the schol-
arship.
Liz Boyd, a spokeswoman for
Granholm, said the governor
considers the Michigan Promise
Scholarship of the utmost impor-

tance and will continue to fight
for its future.
"The governor is hoping to
reach an agreement with law-
makers on a budget that protects
her priorities and one of her top
priorities is the Michigan Prom-
ise Scholarship," Boyd said.
Boyd said the responsibility
of coming up with a state budget
that includes the governor's top
priorities rests on the legisla-
ture's shoulders.
"It is the responsibility of the
state House and Senate to put a
budget on the governor's desk
that she will sign into law," Boyd
said.
If the state's legislature isn't
able to reach a decision by the
Oct. 1 deadline or pass a con-
tinuing resolution of last year's
budget, there will be a partial
government shutdown similar
to the one policymakers faced in
2007, which lasted four hours.
Though Boyd would not say
whether the governor would
reject a budget that didn't include
the program, she said the admin-
istration would stand with those
who continue to fight for it.
"We respect Rep. (Joan) Bauer
(D-Lansing) for not supporting
the recommendation to eliminate
the Promise Scholarship and we
will continue to fight to retain
that scholarship," Boyd said.

Officials on alert
after Denver arrest of
terrorism suspects
By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
Bags of all sizes will be prohib-
ited in Michigan Stadium for this
Saturday's homecoming football
game against Indiana University,
according to University security

officials.
The ban "includes, butis not lim-
ited to, purses, lunch sacks, binocu-
lar cases, fanny packs and diaper
bags," according to a press release
posted on the Department of Public
Safety website and e-mailed to tick-
etholders.
Exceptions will be made for
those with written permission from
medical professionals, according to
the press release.
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown
said the policy was changed as a

result of FBI and Department of
Homeland Security bulletins issued
to law enforcement officials across
the country this week.
She said the bulletins indicated
that sports stadiums, entertain-
ment complexes and hotels could
be at risk.
Brown emphasized that there
have not been any specific threats
"in our stadium or in the state of
Michigan at this point."
The stricter security at the Big
House comes after federal agents

arrested Najibullah Zazi in Den-
ver last Saturday. The airport
shuttle worker was believed to
have been plotting an attack on
New York trains with backpack
bombs. In a subsequent search
of Zazi's apartment, investiga-
tors found bomb-making instruc-
tions and evidence he had been
researching stadiums, entertain-
ment complexes and hotels on his
computer.

City attorney sends
BOX House, others
cease-and-desist
letter for tailgates
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Daily News Editor
The 900 block of South State
Street is known for its raucous tail-
gates on football Saturdays. But
if the Ann Arbor City Attorney's
Office has anything to say about it,
then maize andeblue clad fans, spill-
log into the sidewalks at the corner
of Sate Street and Hoover Street
from the BOX House and other
properties, could be a thing of the
past.
On Tuesday, Senior Assistant
City Attorney Kristen Larcom
sent a letter to Michelle Grobler
of Arch Realty Company, asking
the residents of 917, 927 and 933 S.
State St. to "cease and desist from
engaging in illegal and dangerous
conduct."
The letter goes on to say that
city officials are prepared to file
lawsuits against the landlord if the
behavior continues.
"We appreciate your willing-
ness to pass on to your tenants that
there is 'zero tolerance' for illegal
activities, such as possession of
open intoxicants in public, minors
in possession, littering, excessive

noise and other disorderly con-
duct," the letter states.
In an interview yesterday, Lar-
com said the City Attorney's Office
has sent similar letters to landlords
in years past, adding that the office
sent the same letter to the entire
block.
"We sent them to houses where
the problems occurred," she said.
In the letter, Larcom writes that
the office will take action if the
block continues to be a "public nui-
sance" on football Saturdays.
"Rooftop activities and crowds
spilling onto the public sidewalk
are among the behaviors thatcrete
significant public safety hazards,"
the letter states. "A failure to volun-
tarily discontinue such dangerous
behaviors will require the city to
take more forceful action."
But despite the warning, LSA
senior Alex Girard, who has lived at
933 S. State St. - better known as
the BOX house - for three years,
said students walking by his house
on Saturday won't notice much of a
change.
Girard added that the "sole rea-
son" he chose to live in the house
was because of its Saturday tradi-
tions.
"I don't really think that we have
to do much," he said. "Really just
keep people off the roof and keep
people off the sidewalk."
Girard said he's "not really con-
cerned" about the letter and he

Hieftje explained that Sault Ste.

University students rally at G-20 Summit

Financial leaders are
meeting to discuss
clean energy options
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daity StaffReporter
Early yesterday morning about
two dozen University students
embarked on a six-hour bus ride
to Point State Park in Pittsburgh.
They were on a mission to bring
their concerns about climate poli-
cy to attention of, banking officials
and business leaders from around
the world who were in town for
the G-20 Summit.
The rally precedes the G-20
Summit - a meeting between both

industrial and emerging-market
countries on key issues related to
global economic stability - which
will be held in Pittsburgh today
and tomorrow.
According to a press release dis-
tributed by The Alliance for Cli-
mate Protection, the rally's goal is
to promote the passage of compre-
hensive clean energy and climate
legislation that will provide mil-
lions of jobs, help end U.S. depen-
dence on foreign oil and aid in a
solution to the climate crisis - all
at the same time.
The rally is a collaboration of

The flu epidemic of 1918

The economy-sized
bottles of haod saoitizer
that have been spotted
aroood campos in receot
weeks have tome to serve
as a warning sigo. The
HiNt viros, more affec-
tionately referred to as
swine flu, is sweepingcthe
nation, causing panic in
some students.
What students may
not know is that they
ace not the first crop of
scholars at the Univer-
sity to face an epidemic.
Though it lacked an
adorable farm animal
nickname, the influen-
za Pandemic of 19111 was
also a serious health
concern on campus.
An article printed in

the Daily on Oct. 25, 1918
reported that "the best
day experienced so far by
the medical authorities
in combatingcthe epidem-
ic" on campus was one in
which only a single death
occurred.
To accommodate the
vast numbers of infected
Anon Arbor residents,
the University Hospital
transformed upward of
five of its floors into influ-
coza wards and suspend-
ed all surgical operations
unless they were classi-
fied as emergencies.
In preparation for
an overflow finns the
already reconfigured
wards, the hospital urged
non-flu patients on the

road to recovery to con-
sider whether "they were
well enough to permit
their being discharged,"
so that additional wards
could accommodate
influenza patients.
Like the numerous
c-mails students have
received this year, the
University inl1918warned
the people of Ann Arbor
"not to let up in taking
precautions" and that
"cond itions would not get
back to where they were
unless people continued
to be careful."
While the University
Health Service has asked
students who think they
have the swine flu to stay
away from the health

service building this year
-to prevent the disease
from spreading further
-student cases in 1918
were brought directly
to the hospital for treat-
ment.
According to the Cen-
ters for Disease Control
and Prevention web-
site, "almost all cases of
influenza A, have been
caused by descendants of
the 1918 virus, including
HtNl viruses ... making
the 1918 virus the -moth-
er' of all pandemics."
So it seems as though
the current student pop-
ulation has the alumni of
1918 to thank for the state
of campus health today.

The Michigan House has unani-

cuts in the budget year that starts
Oct. 1.
The bill passed by the House
yesterday now goes to the Senate,
which also is expected to approve
it. It's the first vote on a final budget
billbyeither chamber.
The bill keeps funding for com-
munity colleges at the same $299
million in the current budget year.
Lawmakers couldnot cut much
from the community colleges bud-
get because of rules associated with
accepting money from the federal

Far tougher votes are expected
this week as lawmakers try to enact
about $1.2 billion in spending cuts,
part of a plan to erase a projected
$2.8 billion budget hole.

Firefighters guarded rural

on a march through rugged land
between small Southern California
communities.
The fire was stoked by hot and
dry Santa Ana winds but firefight-

than on the first day of the blaze.
Containment of the fire, about
40 miles northwest of downtown

be fully surrounded until Saturday.
Firefighters cut and burned away

rnained under investigation.

Libya, Iran blast UN
despite calls for unity

Ahmadinejad says
capitalism will fall
as Marxism did
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - On a
daywhentheU.N.andmanynations
appealed for global unity, Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
and Libyan leader Moammar Gad-
hafi yesterday denounced what they
called an unjust world dominated
by five powers.
The Iranian leader, touting his
victory in "glorious" June elec-
tions, which the opposition claimed
were stolen, did not mention the
country's nuclear program in his
speech to the U.N. General Assem-
bly. He addressed the annual gath-
ering immediately after six global
powers who have been trying to
rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions
announced they expect a "serious
response" from Tehran in nuclear
discussions on Oct. 1.
Ahmadinejad lashed out at what
he said was the rapacious capital-
ism of the United States, its Western
allies and Israel, which he accused
of stealing Palestinian land. But he

also offered a hand of friendship to
any country that "honestly" extends
one.
His comment followed an Associ-
ated Press interview Tuesday night
in which he urged President Barack
Obama to view Iran as a potential
friend instead of a threat.
While Ahmadinejad announced
a new Iranian commitment to help
build "a durable peace and security
worldwide for all nations," hisspeech
was laced with anti-Israeli and anti-
Semitic language which prompted
a U.S. walkout. "It is disappointing
that Mr. Ahmadinejad has once again
chosen to espouse hateful, offensive
and anti-Semitic rhetoric," said Mark
Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S.
Mission to the U.N.
The seats of Israel, Canada and
other countries also were empty in
the sparsely filled assembly cham-
ber.
Ahmadinejad predicted that
"expansionist capitalism" will meet
the same fate as Marxism, accus-
ing unnamed powers of "using the
ugliest methods of intimidation and
deceit under the mantle of free-
dom."
He told the assembly that "most

nations including the people of the
United States are waiting for real
and profound change:'
Earlier, Libya's Gadhafi chastised
the United Nations for failing to pre-
vent dozens of wars and accused its
most powerful members of treat-
ing other nations as "second-class,
despised" countries.
In his first speech to the Gen-
eral Assembly in his 40 years as
ruler of Libya, Gadhafi focused on
the inequality of the U.N. Security
Council where five permanent mem-
bers - the U.S., Russia, China, Brit-
ain and France - have veto power.
"It should be called the 'terror
council,"' he said, calling for the
veto to be abolished and member-
ship to be expanded with a greater
voice for Africa, Latin America,
Arab and Muslim nations.
Gadhafi swept up the stairs to the
podium in brown robes after U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
and U.S. President Barack Obama
calledforgreaterglobalengagement
to move toward a world without
nuclear weapons, tackle the threat
of catastrophic climate change, and

with the world," Obama told world
leaders and diplomats from the 192
U.N. member states. "Now is the
time for all of us to take our share of
responsibility for a global response

to global challenges."
Ban opened the 64th ministerial

with an appeal "to create a Unit-
ed Nations of genuine collective
action" to respond to the global
financial, food and energy crises
and the swine flu pandemic.

More questioned in New
York City terror probe
Business owners are
possible witnesses in
homemade bomb plot
NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds
of federal agents and police officers
widened their investigation of af
potential terrorism plot involving
an alleged al-Qaida associate yes-
terday as questions lingered about
whether early missteps might have
made the chore harder.
Investigators have fanned out
in a New York City neighborhood
to re-interview "people previous-
ly encountered" during previous
raids there, and to locate others ,
who know them, according to a laws
enforcement official familiar with
the probe. The effort also includes
a review of phone and other
records that could link potential,
suspects to one another or identify ,
new ones.,;

needs to go to the hospital, the first thought is probably
to call for help. But the law states that an intoxicated
minor who calls for medical attention for a dangerously intoxi-
cated friend can receive a minor in possession charge. To fix this,
the Michigan Student Assembly and the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs are trying to include a "Good Samaritan"
policy in the Student Code of Conduct that would enable students
to call the Department of Public Safety without fear of legal reper-
cussion. While the University should certainly implement this
change, the Good Samaritan policy also deserves consideration
and approval from the state legislature.

The forgotten J

n February 2007, Vice President
Dick Cheney and Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi locked horns
over the Iraq War
troop surge. The
media mudslinging
between the two
reached a climax
when Pelosi called
the White House 1
to complain that
Cheney had ques-
tioned her patrio-
tism. Good Morning CHRIS
America's Jonathan KOSLOWSKI
Karl asked Cheney
what he thought
about Pelosi's accu-
sations.
He responded, "I didn't question
her patriotism. I questioned her judg-
ment. Al-Qaeda functions on the basis
that they think they can break our
will. That's their fundamental under-
lying strategy. My statement was if we
adopt the Pelosi policy, we will vali-
date the strategy of Al-Qaeda. I said
it, and I meant it. And I'm not backing
down."
I put that quote in the "favorite quo-
tations" section of my Facebook pro-
file when I heard it - not only because
it sums up the awe-inspiring gump-
tion of our former vice president, but
also because I wanted it to remind me
of something. If Al-Qaeda perceives
weakness in the United States govern-
ment over the Middle East wars, it will
validate their plan to defeat us.
More than two years later, in a
confidential document leaked to the
Washington Post this week, General
Stanley McChrystal, lead commander
of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghani-
stan, said the U.S. will lose inAfghani-
stan unless more troops are brought to
the fight.
Despite many Democrats' contin-

ued opposition to the wars in the Mid-
dle East, I expected President Barack
Obama to quickly heed the advice
of his top general. After all, it was
just last March when Obama made a
speech outlining his commitment to
"enhance the military, governance,
and economic capacity" of Afghani-
stan. Obama warned, "If the Afghan
government falls to the Taliban - or
allows Al-Qaeda to go unchallenged
- that country will again be a base for
terrorists who want to kill as many of
our people as they possibly can."
But Obama has not yet decided if he
will send more troops to Afghanistan.
Aides have said the President wants
more time to weigh his options, and
USA Today reportedthat several of
Obama's advisors, including Vice Pres-
ident Joe Biden, have revealed their
aversions to increasingU.S. forces.
I don't fault the President for taking
his time to make a careful decision in
a matter that will affect thousands of
Americans and Afghanis, but I don't
understand why this issue is not tak-
ing precedence in his administra-
tion. According to the Washington
Post, Defense Secretary Robert Gates
received McChrystal's report on Aug.
30, nearly a month ago. What have
we heard about Obama's Afghanistan:
strategy between then and the leak of
this report?
Even if you disagree with Obama's
desire to stay in Afghanistan, you
should be wondering why his admin-
istration was devoting so much atten-
tion to health care and climate change
with this bombshell sitting on his
desk. McChrystal guarantees that a
failure to change tactics will result in
defeat. Obama should have been act-
ing quickly on the General's advice or
designing a plan to remove our troops
before the situation becomes even
more deadly.

Obama's hesitation to address this
report as seriously as he hasaddressed

to Al-Qaeda. Maybe the administra-

a well-reasoned troop increase plan
within the coming days, but I fear
Obama has been purposefully delay-
ing action so as not to alienate Dem-
ocrat support for the public health
insurance option. His support margin
is so thin that the risk of an unpopular
troop increase driving away potential
votes is too great.
Obama is stalling on
Afghanistan to save
his domestic agenda.
Regardless of his behind-the-
scene motives, Obama needs to fol-
low in the steps of Dick Cheney and
take a strong stand on Afghanistan
if he hopes to keep Al-Qaeda and
its supporters at bay. Shuffling his
feet, especially for political reasons,
makes the U.S. appear weak, energiz-
es the opposition and validates their
strategy. Obama promised a better
future for Afghanistan. Around half
of America disagrees with him over
health care. Any minuscule impact
we could have on the Earth's climate
would take decades to occur- The
American and Afghani lives at risk
in an extremely unstable situation
demand that Obama take action now.
It's about time he gave this issue the
attention it deserves.

The Good Samaritan policy was proposed
at a meeting between MSA and SACUA to
discuss changes to the Student Code of Con-
duct. These University governing bodies
are following in the steps of state Sen. Liz
Brater (D-Ann Arbor), who introduced a bill
to the legislature in April to protect under-
age drinkers who call for help on behalf of
intoxicated friends. Minors who seek help
for their friends would be exempt from
MIPs and the resulting fines of up to $400,
court appearances and possible probation.
This was Brater's second attempt to pass
such legislation.
MIPs, expensive fines and inconvenient
court appearances are serious threats. Rath-
er than face such repercussions, underage
drinkers may choose not to call the police
when friends are in need. But lives could be
saved if only underage drinkers had less to
fear from calling the police at urgent times.
The law should not act as a deterrent to sav-
ing lives and amending the Student Code of
Conduct to include a Good Samaritan clause
signals the University wants to seriously
combat alcohol-related deaths.
Still, the University is hardly the only
place in need of such a policy. Despite two
attempts, the legislature failed to act on
Brater's bill. But this statewide bill is the

best way to make sure that lives are not
lost because underage drinkers fear getting
MIPs. If the legislature really wants to make
protect the lives of underage drinkers, it
should reconsider the Good Samaritan pol-
icy and adopt it.
But the University, for its part, is not in
the clear on drinking issues just by putting
the Good Samaritan policy into the Student
Code of Conduct. The alarming amount of
alcohol-related deaths on college campus-
es has caught the attention of 135 college
presidents, who have reacted by signing
the Amethyst Initiative. This proposal calls
on Congress to look into the 1984 National
Minimum Drinking Age Act and determine
whether it has been effective at curbing
binge drinking. A discussion on the effec-
tiveness of the current drinking age could
only be beneficial, but University President
Mary Sue Coleman has refused to sign the
Amethyst Initiative, calling into question
her dedication to finding solutions to binge
drinkingas well as her supposed open-mind-
edness toward new ideas and approaches.
So while the University needs a Good
Samaritan clause, it also needs a president
who is willing to look for new solutions to
the binge drinking problem on college cam-
puses.

Make respectapriority while
recruitingfor student groups
TO THE DAILY:
As the new academic year kicks off, many
student organizations start off with heavy
recruitment. But as different groups try to get
their message out, recruitment can become
competitive. Though competition can be a
powerful uniting factor, it is our hope that
recruitment strategies are done in a respectful
manner. Strategies of hazing and destruction
of Diag boards, banners and flyers are not going
to unite our community. We have seen more
of this behavior this year, and it is worth the
reminder that respecting competitors is a more
effective strategy. As the semester progresses,

we would like to encourage co-sponsorships as
one way to foster an inclusive campus environ-
ment.
Itis our individual responsibility tobe aware
of our own role in promoting a positive and safe
campus climate. If you feel that you have been
a target of hate or bias, please know that there

Don' t Tread O M

Campus is a vibrant and hap-
pening environment: living
in Ann Arbor presents many
opportunities to
learn outside of
class. Unfortu-
nately, undergrad-
uate students are
often unaware of
these opportuni-
ties, and they are
not always at fault.
While students HARSHA
should undeniably .pAprgA
be more aware of
their surroundings,
the various Uni-
versity departments and organiza-
tions that sponsor noteworthy events
and important speakers should also
make a more concerted and orga-
nized effort to advertise them.-
A university setting is meant to
foster education and facilitate the
broadening of our mental horizons.
The diverse range of events that
occurs on a college campus is nearly
unparalleled. Where else can a per-
son attend a Warhol exhibit, a ques-
tion-and-answer session with the
Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court and a speech from a Nobel
Prize-winning economist and New
York Times columnist all in the span
of one month for free? It's impor-
tant to utilize this advantage as stu-
dents, since such opportunities may
never return. Tuition is hardly inex-
pensive, so we should get the most
knowledge for our buck.
But it's difficult to take advantage
of these opportunities when they
aren't well advertised. I followed
Paul Krugman's weekly column in
the New York Times over the sum-
mer and would have been interested

to hear him speak had I known he
would be visiting campus. The Mich-
igan Daily did a short news story
on Krugman's planned visit, but it
ran on Sept. 15 and said the tickets
were gone. Luckily, one of my Politi-
cal Science GSIs had sent an email
to students in my class on Sept., 9
informing us of the upcoming event
- I went to the Union and picked up
tickets the next day. I couldn't have
been the only person who was ill-
informed, because not many other
undergraduates I spoke with knew
of Krugman's visit, either.
The promotion of sponsored
events on campus is clearly unco-
ordinated. While this isn't anyone's
fault specifically, it's instead due to
the conglomeration of event spon-
sors on campus that all use different
methods of promoting their func-
tions. For example, the Public Policy
School and the Citigroup Founda-
tion will host Krugman, whereas the
Michigan Student Assembly hosted
oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens for
Homecoming Week last year. The
different advertising methods make
it difficult to find specifics on each
event in a centralized location.
The University does have resourc-
es to advertise events: the UM Events
website lists a great number of hap-
penings around campus. But the prob-
lem with the website is that especially
significant functions are drowned out
by a flood of other events.
The best way to fix this problem
would be to have events advertised
through a well-sorted centralized
source. UM Events does this to a cer-
tain extent, but does not differentiate
between a Free Shabbat Dinner at
Hillel and Paul Krugman's lecture,
unless the user specifies they are look-

ing for a lecture. The student should
have some responsibility in finding
events of their interestbut should not
have to sift through so much infor-
mation in order to find them if they're
not entirely sure what they might be
looking for. If the website was rede-
signed to highlight events that occur
less regularly, like Krugman's visit, or
if there were centralized e-mail lists
to direct student attention, informa-
There has to be a
better way to learn
about 'U' events.
tion might be better distributed.
While it's true that many do attend
noteworthy events - Krugman tick-
ets were gone, after all - it doesn't
mean that enough people know about
them. A rush for tickets is obviously
not desirable - the reason I was able
to obtain mine mayhave beenbecause
people weren't aware he was coming.
But just because the seats are filling
doesn't mean there's enough pro-
motion. People who want to attend
should be able to if they're willing to
wait for tickets early enough. It's only
fair.
Becoming more knowledgeable is
something we all should strive for. A
morediverse perspectiveis neverbad,
be it in the arts, politics, or sciences.
It's vital that students are made more
aware of the opportunities that they
have to learn on campus.

"When people live in healthy
places, they are healthier people,"
said Clement. "When people have

people. When people have access
to education, they are healthier

Clement said economic prog-
ress could be made by expanding
current projects.
"We need to take some of the
things going on in our state and
take them statewide," Clement

said. "One of the things we've been
doing in Ann Arbor is moving to

Heiftje said these streetlights,
which are made in Michigan, have
the potential to be on college cam-

that the expansion would not only
benefit the nation's environment,
but also the state's financial situ-

"What may be the most impor-

be on making cities a place where

First-year Business graduate
student Gordon Saft, who is from
New York, said the move doesn't
bother him.
"I remember going to Yankee
playoff games three weeks after
Sept. 11, and no one could bring
anything in," he said.
"I think people can make that
sacrifice if there actually is a
threat that seems legitimate," he
continued. "It's 100,000 people
in one place. I see no issue with
it."
Saft added that he doesn't bring
bags into the stadium to begin
with, and that it was the female
fans he would "imagine would
have a problem with it."
"I think it's a little bit expreme,"
said Kanika Kochhar, an LSA
freshman. She said there should
be "a different process," like one
similar to airport security screen-
ings.
Asked if metal detectors would
be used by security at the game,
Brown said DPS reserves the right

to do so, though "it has not been a
traditional method."
But some female fans down-
played the inconvenience.
Katie Jourdan, a first-year Pub-
lic Health student, said her pock-
ets were enough.
"I think a lot of people don't
mind just bringing their ID, a little
bit of cash or maybe a camera or
something," she said.
Kinesiology junior Lara Hitch-
cock agreed.
"Personally, it wouldn't be a big
issue for me," she said. "I don't
really bring anything."
The press release encourages
fans to arrive at the gate earlier
than usual, as the increased secu-
rity could slow the flow of entry.
The gates will open at 10 a.m.
"Students have been arriving
very, very late," Brown said. "They
should come sooner this week-
end."

PROMISE
From Page 1A
In a phone interview, Sen. Liz
Brater (D-Ann Arbor) said she is
against cutting the program.
"I'm opposed to those cuts,"
Brater said. "We made a promise,
and it's very difficult for Michigan
families to find the money to send
their sons and daughters to col-
lege."
Brater sponsored an amend-
ment to a Senate bill earlier in the
budget process to restore funding
for the scholarship program, but it
was rejected in a vote that followed
party lines.
In an e-mail interview, Rep.
Rebekah Warren (D-Ann Arbor)
stressed the importance of the
Michigan Promise.
"Investing in education is an
investment in our future, and the
Promise Scholarship continues to
help thousands of families fulfill
their dreams of a college educa-
tion," Warren wrote.
Warren wrote that now, more
than ever, the program is needed
and she would fight to maintain
it.
"In these difficult economic
times, we have an even greater
responsibility to help our young
people get the skills they need to
compete for those good-paying
jobs," she wrote. "Cutting the
Promise scholarship is completely
counterproductive and unaccept-
able - I will continue to fight to
save this vital program."
Vice President for Government
Relations Cynthia Wilbanks, who
acts as a liaison between the Uni-
versity administration and Lansing,
said she understands the difficult
position legislators are in.
"This is really difficult, and I
don'tthinktherewere alotofcheers
in the room when this conference
report was passed," Wilbanks said.
"But we all acknowledge there are
really tough decisions that need to
be made."
Wilbanks said that she looks

forward to seeing the higher educa-
tion budget in the near future, and
that legislators are currently work-
ing on it.
"It's all coming pretty fast and
furious, and there are a lot of mov-
ing parts; there's a lot of differing
views," Wilbanks said. "I think
there's a common goal at least of
having a state budget in place by
Oct. 1."
The conference report will now
go to the House and Senate to be
voted on, Wilbanks said.
"(Conference reports) cannot be
amended and they are simply voted
up or down and neither the House
or the Senate have voted so far on
these conference reports, including
thehigher educationbill,"Wilbanks
said. "That might come (today), so
there may be another pickle to this
debate that could occur in the next
several days."
Despite uncertainties to the state
budget, Wilbanks said she still
hopes that a solution may be found
to maintain the Michigan Promise
Scholarship.
"I'm an optimist, so based on
that, I'd like to believe that with the
governor and the leadership in the
House and Senate, they may yet find
a way, a means, a funding source,
and use the Promise grants in some
shape or form," she said.
Of the 6,096 students eligible
to receive the Michigan Promise
scholarship on campus, Fitzger-
ald said 1,717 students currently
demonstrate financial need for
the scholarship - as calculated
by an internal University formu-
la - while 4,379 students do not
demonstrate financial need for the
scholarship.
"The U of M is committed to
meeting the full demonstrated
financial need of all undergradu-
ate students from Michigan,"
Fitzgerald said. "If the state were
to ultimately reduce or eliminate
the Promise scholarships, the
University would provide addi-

tional financial aid up to the level
required to meet the students' full
demonstrated need."
Phil Hanlon, vice provost for
academic and budgetary affairs,
echoed Fitzgerald, saying it is one
of the University's highest priori-
ties.
"We will find the money to com-
plete their financial aid packages,"
Hanlon said of students who were
promised the scholarship as part of
their financial aid. "There's almost
no higher priority than that for the
University."
Hanlon said that in planning
this year's budget, University
officials set aside additional fund-
ing for financial aid that could be
used to fill gaps for students with
demonstrated need.
"We also set aside some one time
funds that will allow us to meet
some of that $2 million," Hanlon
said, noting that when planning the
budget University officials noticed
that some legislation proposed cut-
ting the Michigan Promise pro-
gram.
Students who are eligible for the
scholarship but do not demonstrate
financial need will not receive
scholarship payments from the
University if the Michigan Promise
Scholarship program is cut from
the state budget.
However, Fitzgerald encouraged
students to contact the Office of
Financial Aid if their circumstances
have changed and they believe they
may now eligible for an increase in
need-based scholarships.
"For students who have not pre-
viously demonstrated need, they
have been asked to sort of pay that
amount up front and then they
would be credited that amount if
the Promise scholarship comes
through," Fitzgerald said.

erate support for federal climate
change legislation and educate the
public about the urgency of com-
prehensive reform.
"We want to see an end to our
dependence on foreign oil and the
creation of essentially a whole new
sector of jobs in America," Canfora
said.
He explained that clean energy
jobs are very similar to things
Michigan's workforce already does
every day. He said clean energy
jobs range from the people who
build things like solar panels,
windmills and solar batteries to
the people who operate them, sell
them and make the components for
them.
"The No. 1 way to create energy
is efficiency," Canfora said.
LSA .freshman Nikki McIntyre
attended the rally and said she
made the trip to learn more about
the ways in which the United
States can promote clean energy
jobs and what she as an individual
can do to help.
"The rally is just there to raise
awareness and get people involved
and let the government know that
we want action to be taken," McIn-
tyre said.
Canfora said he hoped the rally
would demonstrate to leaders gath-
ered in Pittsburgh how critical it is
for the world to create clean energy
jobs.
Besides making their voices
heard and their numbers seen, the

rally's attendees also got to enjoy
musical performances and hear
from keynote speakers.
Performances by Joan Jett and
the Blackhearts and country sing-
er Kathy Mattea entertained the
crowd while prominent figures like
Leo Gerard, president of the United
Steelworkers; Carl Pope, executive
director of the Sierra Club; Richard
Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO;
and Maggie Fox, CEO and president
of the Alliance for Climate Protec-
tion, offered their perspectives on a
green energy economy.
McIntyre said the musical per-
formances were both "great" and
"diverse."
"It brought all these people
together from different walks of
life and everyone was just having
a good time together," McIntyre
said, adding the politicians and
other leaders who spoke at the
event were also interesting.
Canfora said that Gerard's pres-
ence at the rally was a big deal.
"I think that with Mr. Gerard,
the president of the United Steel-
workers, you can't think of any-
thing more blue collar and more
labor and frankly more American
worker than the steel workers and
to see them say that our future is
in the green economy and that we
need to go in that direction, I think
that's very poignant," Canfora
said.
McIntyre said attending the
rally was fun and energizing, but
also provided a valuable educa-
tional experience.
"I learned a lot about how our
economy can turn towards new
sources for jobs," McIntyre said.
"We can also keep the jobs that we
have right now and keep the quali-
fied people working and just apply
them to green jobs."
Asked whether she thought the
rally accomplished everything the
group hoped it would, McIntyre
said she thought it did.
"I think they met their goal
despite some of the obstacles they
had to overcome," she said. "It's
still continuing on for the rest
of the week so there's more to
come."

Nittany Lions seek
redemption against
Iowa in Happy Valley

Redshirt sophomore defensive tackle Ryan Van Bergen tallied four tackles against Eastern Michigan last Saturday and makes a mean burger.
Van Brge' burgers

Teammates
impressed by
defensive tackle's
culinary skills
By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
This summer, Donovan War-
ren ate one of the best hamburgers
since he's been in Ann Arbor.
To Warren's preference, it was
well done.
And instead of ordering from
a gourmet hamburger restaurant
like Grizzly Peak, it came from
Ryan Van Bergen's backyard.
Over the summer, the redshirt
scphomore defensive tackle enter-
tained teammates Warren, David
Molk and Steve Watson and show-
cased his grilling skills.
"He knows how to cook good
hamburgers," Warren said, smiling
at the thought.
And when Van Bergen made the
switch from defensive end to defen-

sive tackle this season, the burgers
were good enough to add 10 pounds
to his 261-pound frame.
Of course, all the weight didn't
come from samplinghis handiwork,
but at his new position, Van Bergen
is beginning to hit his stride. The
Whitehall native has started every
game at defensive tackle this year,
tallying a career-high four tackles
and assisting on a sack last Satur-
day against Eastern Michigan.
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
has praised Van Bergen as one of
the team's hardest workers.
"You can just tell, his passion,
every practice," Rich Rodriguez
said. "He's on special teams, and
he'll do anything we want. He
would play on every special team
we want him to."
What makes Van Bergen so ver-
satile is his speed - with a time of
4.9 in the 40-yard dash, Van Ber-
gen can compete at any spot on the
line.
Despite losing three starters to
graduation, the defensive line has
shown marked improvements from
last season. After three games, the

defensive line has tallied 53 tack-
les, compared to 45 at this time last
season.
Some of that extra explosiveness
comes from better off-field prepa-
ration, and Van Bergen says he feels
more conditioned than at this time
last year. Whether it's defending a
short slant play, out route or screen
pass, Van Bergen said the defensive
line has made running to the foot-
ball a priority.
"You see a lot of clips at the end
of film where there's 11 hats on
the ball, and something (defensive
coordinator Greg) Robinson really
preaches and I think we're doing a
good job so far," Van Bergen said.
With senior Brandon Graham
having the status he does, oppos-
ing offenses definitely take notice,
often giving the star defensive end
double coverage. Playing No. 2
behind Graham last season was a
learning experience for Van Ber-
gen on and off the field. A year later,
Van Bergen is taking charge in his
new role.
"I'm just trying to complement
Brandon Graham," Van Bergen said

during fall camp. "As a senior, he's a
leader by actions, and words aren't
really his best aspect of leader-
ship. I try to fill that gap and try to
motivate the team and the defense,
along with Obi (Ezeh) and Dono-
van Warren. Everybody is just try-
ing to play a little bit bigger role,
leadership-wise."
NOTES: Redshirt sophomore
safety Mike Williams wore a red
jersey during Wednesday's prac-
tice and rode a training bike. Red-
shirt freshman and former walk-on
Jordan Kovacs took reps with the
No. 1 offense in Williams' place.
... With redshirt sophomore cen-
ter David Molk sidelined for four
to six weeks with a broken foot,
Rodriguez said fifth-year senior
David Moosman will start at center
against Indiana. Filling Moosman's
spot at right guard will either be
redshirt junior John Ferrara with
redshirt sophomore Mark Huyge at
right tackle or Huyge at guard and
redshirt junior Perry Dorrestein at
tackle. At Wednesday's practice,
Hugye and Dorrestein took reps
with the No.1 offense.

For the Daily
As the Big Ten season begins this
weekend, several teams already
find themselves in desperate need
of a win or big-time statement.
More than 100,000 fans will fill
Beaver Stadium on Saturday night
when No. 5 Penn State (3-0) seeks
revenge against Iowa for dealing
out the Nittany Lions' only regu-
lar-season loss of 2008. Under the
lights in Happy Valley, this game
will serve as an early-season fore-
caster for the Big Ten title.
Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno,
the Division I all-time wins leader,
possesses one of the best backfields
in the conference with senior quar-
terback Daryll Clark and junior
running back Evan Royster.
The Hawkeyes (3-0) can't claim
similar talent at the skill positions,
especially after Iowa starting run-
ning back Jewel Hampton was
declared out for the season after
sustaining a knee injury this sum-
mer. Yet the Hawkeyes can lay
legitimate claim to having one of
the best offensive lines and defens-
es in the Big Ten.
With a win, the Hawkeyes could
climb back into the Top 25. But
Iowa has bounced back since and
poses a large threat to the highest-
ranked Big Ten team.
Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and
the rest of the College GameDay
crew will be present at the prime-
time ABC game in what has the
potentialto be one ofthe best games
of this early season.
MICHIGAN STATE AT
WISCONSIN
Neither the GameDay crew,
the accompanying hype, nor Joe
Pa Legend will be in attendance
at Camp Randall on Saturday. But
stakes will still be high for both
teams.
Back-to-back losses to Central
Michigan and Notre Dame have
critics claiming "Same Ol' Sparty."
Michigan State (1-2) has stumbled
out of the blocks, and with high

expectations going into this season,
coach Mark Dantonio can't afford
to begin the season 1-3.
The game rests on whether the
Spartan defense can finally live
up to its preseason billing, and if
Dantonio can end his quarterback
"competition" and name sopho-
more Kirk Cousins the full-time
starter.
Wisconsin, though undefeated,
struggled against Northern Illinois
and Fresno State and has much to
prove.
Expect whispers concerning
Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema's job
security to grow louder and more
frequent if the Badgers lose to a
stumbling Spartan team - at home.
ILLINOIS AT
NO.13 OHIO STATE
A month ago, this matchup con-
tained a great deal more luster.
At that point, many pundits had
Illinois (1-1) labeled a conference
dark horse, and Ohio State sopho-
more quarterback Terrelle Pryor
was still considered football's great
prodigy.
But going into The Horseshoe,
Illinois coach Ron Zook finds him-
self on the hot seat. He needs a
signature win against a top team,
followed by a string of consistent
play
The Illini will need a great effort
out of talented senior quarterback
Juice Williams. But a transcendent
four-touchdown performance, like
the one Williams had two years
ago that helped topple the then
top-ranked Buckeyes, seems highly
unlikely.
With top Big Ten wideout junior
Arrelious Benn and Williams pre-
sumably healthy together for the
first time this year, Illinois could
give Ohio State (2-1) a scare. If
everything goes right for the Illini
and their defense can make a few
timely stops, Illinois could sneak
out of Columbus with its eight win
in 11tries at the Shoe.

Michigan's three keys to success

Junior Justin Meram (right) scored a hat trick in M ichigan's 5-1 win.
Meran s hat trick
sparks Blue's offense

The Michigan women's
soccer team was tired,
injured and coming off a
disappointing loss.
The Wolverines were playing
Southern Cal on Sept. 13 - ateam
that had a preseason No. 8 ranking.
- with a ragtag group of starters,
second-stringers and youngsters
making their
first career TIM
starts. ROHAN
Michigan
led for most of On women's
the tightly con- soccer
tested game.
The Wolverines lost 2-1, but even
in defeat, Michigan learned it can
play with physical and talented
teams this year. Not next year, or
the year after - this year.
Expectations haven't been high
for awhile. The Wolverines were
4-10-5 last season, in Ryan's first
year, and the program hasn't had a
winning record since 2006.
But since the Wolverines' game
against Southern Cal, they have
been playing winning soccer. That
culminated in last Sunday's win
over Miami (Fla.)
Michigan (5-5) beat the Hur-
ricanes 1-0 and passed last year's
win total. With 20 seconds left in
the first half, freshman Holly Hein

kicked in her own rebound off of a
free kick from junior Jackie Car-
ron to score the game's winning
goal.
After the game, Michigan coach
Greg Ryan said he knew how
important the win was for his
team.
"It means that the girls can start
believing in themselves," Ryan
said. "These girls, going into the
Big Ten season, are going to say,
'Okay, maybe this team has a little
bit more experience and more
depth.'... We can beat these level
teams if we playthe right way."
There are three keys to Michi-
gan's recent resurgence, and if
the Wolverines continue to follow
these, the rest of the season will be
a success.
First and foremost, the goalie
competition is over - Michigan
needs redshirt freshman Haley
Kopmeyer to be the netminder.
When the Wolverines' defense
did make mistakes against the
Hurricanes, Kopmeyer made the
necessary plays to win. She also
made multiple saves to preserve a
shutout on Sept. 16, when Michi-
gan topped Oakland 3-0.
Kopmeyer had been splitting
time in the net with redshirt
sophomore Kristen Keane, with

each goalie making five starts this
season. Kopmeyer has started
the last three games dating back
to the close loss at Southern Cal.
But Kopmeyer has 39 saves on the
year with an 83-percent save per-
centage. Keane has 10 saves and a
50-percent save percentage.
Kopmeyer's two consecutive
shutouts show that she deserves to
be the full-time starting goalie.
The second step to success is to
play tight and smart defense, which
has not been a problem lately for
the Wolverines. When the ball is
in their half of the zone they have
a plan to control it. And if someone
gets beaton a play, a defender cov-
ers up for her teammate. Against
Miami, Michigan allowed the Hur-
ricanes to get deep into its zone, but
then cracked down, forcing most of
Miami's shots to come from outside
the box.
All of Michigan's defenders
have been on top of their games
last week, too. Moving the ball
well and keeping in front of the
offense has proved to be a posi-
tive strategy for the Wolverines
defense.
And finally, Michigan's offense
must continue to capitalize on
opposing defenses' mistakes.
Converting on lapses on defensive

coverage and timely attacks are the
way to go. The Wolverines have
taken advantage of the few oppor-
tunities they have received, but
they need to realize that they can-
not score at will. The team doesn't
have the players to do that.
With junior Jackie Carron tak-
ing the free kicks, the Wolverines
are in a good position to continue
this style of offense, which is effi-
cient yet not too flashy.
Carron has been clutch all year
with her placement. Her team-
mates and coach all have praised
her kicks, and she leads the team
with six assists.
But this won't yield much more
offense. Michigan has scored a
meager 1.5 goals per game this
season, while opponents have tal-
lied 1.8 goals per game.
The Wolverines needto con-
tinue to cash in on the few oppor-
tunities they get per game since
with a strong defense and reliable
goalkeeper, that should be enough
to win games.
Sunday's victory over Miami
has the Wolverines' confidence
at an all-time high in the Ryan
era, and they are playing winning
soccer. But they needto keep it up
to make 2009 a competitive year
instead of another transition one.

By BEN ESTES
and JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writers
Junior forward Justin Meram
joined the Michigan men's soccer
team this season after a dominat-
ingtwo-year stint atYavapai Junior
College. He notched 50 goals in his
tiie there, but entered last night's
game against Bowling Green with
only two goals in a Michigan jer-
sey.
He MICHIGAN 5
had a lot BOWLING GREEN 1
of mak-
ing up to do.
Meram was held out of the
starting lineup due to soreness in
his right quadriceps, and watched
the Falcons take a quick 1-0 lead
on a transition goal. Early on, the
Wolverines struggled to penetrate
a 4-4-3 defense, which clogs the
middle of the field and forces the
aqtion outside.
Meram entered the match in
the 32nd minute and changed the
entire tone of the game bynotching
his first hat trick as a Wolverine.
Michigan scored five unanswered
g4als in22minutes enrouteto a 5-1
victory.
"Justin's a guy that scores, he
never turns down an opportunity
to shoot," Michigan coach Steve
Burns said. "And if you don't buy a
ticket, you're never gonna win the
lottery. He bought three of them."
Meram punished the Falcons
(1,5-2) at the UM Soccer Complex
with his timely runs and fancy
footwork, and tied the match at
one in the 40th minute on a blast
into the lower left corner.
"Today was about laving a lot of

fun," Meram said. "We were down
and I just wanted to get out there
and have a positive attitude about it
all - the injuries, not starting. Just
have fun, go out there and contrib-
ute to the team and get a victory. "
The equalizer seemed to ener-
gize the entire team, and Michigan
(7-1) carried the momentum into
the second half. In the 50th min-
ute, Meram headed home the game
winner off a beautiful cross from
freshman defender Brian Klemc-
zak.
Following an opponent's goal,
Burns emphasizes the importance
of winning the ball back within
five passes. His team answered
that call last night. Just 28 sec-
onds after Meram's go-ahead goal,
freshman midfielder Hamoody
Saad added another, extending the
lead to 3-1.
"This is a team that is starting
to grow in confidence, and they
recognize that they're a second-
half team," Burns said. "We talk-
ed about how to beat this team.
They're going to have to walk off
the field shattered, and I thinkthey
really took that to heart and really
went after it for those first 10-12
minutes of the second half and put
Bowling Green away."
Meram capped his night with
a one-timer in the 58th minute,
and senior forward Mauro Fuzetti
quickly followed by netting his
team-leading seventh goal of the
season. Since Sept. 4, the Wolver-
ines have outscored their oppo-
nents 16-1 in the second half. Their
late game heroics will be especially
helpful Sunday, when Michigan
enters Big Ten play with a road trip
to Penn Stage.

FILM
Deciphering an artist's

r he typical college party
begins with an empty living
room, 20 or so people, and,
most importantly, a suitable
iPod mix tuned through a set
of subwoofers scooped from
the basement of one of the
tenant's parents. And while
this setting may seem to be
enough, if not ideal, for the
average party, LSA senior
Adam Lynn and Business
senior Jason Javer thought
otherwise. Instead of the
empty living room, they got
a stadium. Instead of 20 peo-
ple, 4,000 showed up. And,
instead of a dinky-ass iPod,
they got Nas. While a Friday
night party is a sufficiently
ambitious undertaking for
the average undergrad, Lynn
and Javer thought bigger.
Way bigger. .
It was last March when
Lynn and Javer brought Nas
to Eastern Michigan's Convo-
cation Center. The show was
the culmination of an entre-
preneurial journey that began
as away of coping with classic
fraternity house drama, and it
was a decisive success.
It takes a lot, though, to
make a rhyme-spitting Nas

appear out of thin air, even
though audience members
are more likely think about
the music than the work that
went in to putting the whole
event together. Lynn and
Javer, however, now
specialize in bringing
big names to campus.
Their company Social
Studyz LLC aims to
promote upcoming
concerts even grander
than their past scores.
The two students'
journey from typical
undergrads to concert
promoters and pro-
ducers has been, in
the words of Javer, "an
ongoingentrepreneur-
ial process." One of the
first times they real-
ized they had a knack
for putting events
together was when the
two were appointed
social chairs of their
fraternity, Phi Kappa
Psi, their sophomore year.
Lynn and Javier enjoyed a
semester of planning and
promoting parties until Phi
Kappa Psi was placed on
social probation.

er's hard work finally paid
off when they met Nas and
witnessed the crazy amount
of people who came to see
him perform. Close to 4,000
people attended the concert
at nearby Eastern Michigan
University. Lynn and Javer
were ecstatic. Not only to
have met the hip hop royal,
but also to have produced
such an enormous event.
"It was ... the coolest expe-
rience I ever had," Lynn said.
But he was quick to point out
the hardships that came with
the endeavor as well.

High five
A notable Ann Arborite gives five
answers to a curious question.
Alexander Horvath
Owner, Get Your Game On
What are your favorite card, board or
miniatures games?
1. "Magic: The Gathering": This cornerstone of the gaming market has
been around for 16 years, and continues to be as fresh today as it has ever been.
Deck construction is a work of art, and Ann Arbor's local competition is thebest
in Michigan.
2. "Agricola": Don't let the farming theme fool you. At around one hour of
play time, this is one of the most strategic board games on the market, with
immense replayability. Plays with anywhere from two to five players. I play this
every week.
3. "Dungeons & Dragons": It's an RPG, with miniatures! Whether you're
into 3.5 or the newer 4th edition, it's a classic!
4. "Small World": A newer board game that lets you play several fantasy
races in your questfor (small) world domination. This is a great "gateway" game
for non-gamers, as it's fun, a bit lighter and the theme is unique.
5. "Warhammer Fantasy": If I could just get my Bretonnia army painted in
the Game Of Thrones theme, I'd be ready to play. Someday.

SINGLE REVIEW
KAREN 0 AND THE KIDS
"ALL IS LOVE"

Spike Jonze's wildly anticipated adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's clas-
sic "Where the Wild Things Are" not only features a screenplayby literary favorite
Dave Eggers (writer of "Away We Go"),but a soundtrack including a series of collab-
orations by such hipster heavyweights as Deerhunter's Bradford Cox, Liars's Aaron
Hemphill and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O. This assortment of high-profile art-
ists has teamed together under the name Karen O and the Kids to produce a series
of tracks capturing the picture's mischievous nature. The soundtrack's first single
"All Is Love" features subdued, lullaby-like guitar strings and an untrained chil-
drens' choir carrying the song's simplistic notes. The chorus, proclaiming the pow-
ers of human emotion, highlights the curious nature of the film's child protagonist.
Uncomplicated and jovial, the track grants a glimpse of what the picture may offer. *

The perfect evening

You know when you find some-
thing online that you absolutely
can't pass up?
Well, during my -
nightly Internet search
for "hockey moms"
and "private dinners,"'
I stumbled across a
whopper: a once in
a lifetime discovery
that I absolutely had to ZACH
have - "Private Din- SM Z
ner for Five with Sarah -
Palin."
After repeatedly rubbing my eyes
and looking at the computer screen in a
record-setting quintuple take, I find out
that the former governor, former Vice
Presidential candidate, former mayor and
former Miss Congeniality, is auctioning
off a quiet, cozy dinner for me and up to
four of my friends for charity on eBay.
Starting bid: a cool $25,000.
Dinner with Sarah Palin? How could I
resist? I immediately liquidated my sav-
ings, stocks and bonds, sold my car and
a kidney and did a few things I'm not too
proud of in the park, butI was ultimately
able to scrape together enough cash to

Grizzly Bear snaps,
crackles and pops

Speaking with the
mastermind behind this
year's indie darling
By JOSH BAYER
Daily MusicEditor
For those of you who have been liv-
ing in a padlocked
Tupperware container
paperweighted down Grizzly Bear
by an ogre for the past At the
few weeks, Grizzly
Bear is playing at the Michigan
Michigan Theater this Saturday at 8p.m.
Saturday night and it Starting at $18
is going to be quite the
show.
Why? Because Grizzly Bear is the
indie-buzz band right now. With the
group's release of Veckatimest this past
May, which cracked the top 10 on the
U.S. Billboard Charts (no insignificant
feat for an experimental psych-folk out-
fit), the band has quickly reached the
forefront of the art-pop scene. Thanks
in no small part to Grizzly Bear's 2008
tour with Radiohead, rave reviews and
infectious single "Two Weeks" (the
catchiest thing to hit the waves in recent
memory), the little band from Brooklyn
has quickly developed into an almighty
indie presence.
Just three years ago, Grizzly Bear
became the paradigm for independent
music, recording the bulk of equally
phenomenal Yellow House in vocalist
Ed Droste's mother's house. The record
mirrored the quaintness of its makeshift
studio, lulling along majestically like an
enchanted pirate ship, quietly wowing
without ever grappling for attention.
Veckatimest builds on the cathedral-
like atmospherics of its predecessor,
dolloping clearer, poppier harmonies on
top of lush, sonically varied, quilt-like
arrangements. The band balances out
its exploratory side with a newfound
sense of immediacy and accessibility.
The result is pure ear candy, and it has
elevated Grizzly Bear's status in the
music world exponentially.
Chris Taylor is the mastermind
behind Grizzly Bear's bottomless sound.
In addition to being the band's bassist,
he has produced its last two albums.
Taylor also plays a central role in craft-
ing the band's eclectic, jazzy aesthetic,
often filling in on clarinet, flute and
saxophone. And if all that isn't enough,
he contributes on keys and electronics

as well. Simply put, the man is made of
music.
The Daily spoke with him on the
phone last week, and after talking to
him, one would be hard-pressed to
conjure the image of a hyper-talented
multi-instrumentalist. Taylor exudes
modesty.
When asked how he achieves such
an iconically rich bass sound on Griz-
zly Bear's albums, he responded, "uh,
I don't know, I didn't know it was that
unique. I just sort of go for what I like. I
really like Joy Division, y'know?"
He referred to his mid-'70s Rick-
enbacker bass and added, pleasantly
stumped, "I have sort of a special bass
head I guess, maybe that's part of it."
Belonging to a band with such a lofty
sound, Taylor certainly doesn't seem to
have overly lofty ambitions. In response
to what he would most want a fan to say
to him to consummate everything he's
trying to do with his music, he said:
"Sort of just saying 'thank you for mak-
ing music' ... for whatever personal rea-
son they have. If they appreciate the fact
that you did it, I think that that's a really
high compliment."
While the world may have found some-
thing extraterrestrial in Grizzly Bear's
practically tactile soundscapes, Taylor
just seems to be doing his thing. When
asked to use one word to describe his
music, he casually dropped "rock-pop."
As for the cereal that most accurately
embodies his band? "Rice Krispies."
He's a man of simple pleasures. When
asked what job he'd most like to have
if he weren't a musician, he responded
without hesitation: "Salt farmer."
"A salt farmer on the Mediterranean
or something ... I love salt, I love cooking
a lot. I'd make salt for people."
Moreover, he seemed happily oblivi-
ous to Veckatimest's mammoth 86 out of
100 on Metacritic (the Internet's leading
art criticism aggregator), a score denot-
ing universal acclaim.
"I didn't know about that ... oh, nice!
Cool," Taylor said. "Yeah, 1 don't really
follow that stuff. I don't really have time
for that. Does it faze me? I don't really
know. Can I check non-applicable?"
The guy's a diplomat too. He politely
declined to reveal of whom in the world
he's most jealous. And when probed to
divulge what he thinks is the most over-
rated album of all time, he plead the
fifth as well: "I don't really like the idea
that something is overrated," he said.
"I think it's cool that people have their
thing that they get into."

He elaborated: "I mean, y'know,
Josh Groban's Christmas album sold so
much ... I might not listen to his Christ-
mas album, but I know how many peo-
ple really probably really loved that.
Y'know? My mom would've loved that,
totally."
As far as touring with Radiohead,
he describes the band as "surprisingly
nice."
"They're totally friendly, down-to-
earth people. ... They're probably one of
the least snobby bands I've ever met ...
especially given how snobby they could
be. They really could be super, super
snobby and they're just not."
He goes on to describe any indie
kid's wet dream: "They would hang. We
bought this little hibachi barbecue grill,
and, uh, we would have barbecues. They
would have dinner with us and stuff. On
pavement."
Taylor's music tastes are as refined
and all-over-the-map as his own band's
music, but he loves Radiohead and Neil
Young.
Discussing his favorite concerts of
all-time, he talks about being 19 and
getting "stoned accidentally for the first
time" at a Radiohead show at The Gorge
in Seattle, his hometown.
"I sort of got like a contact high cause
so much weed was being smoked and I
didn't smoke weed ... oh man, that was
so great," lie said.
Taylor also highly recommends
Arthur Russell, an obscure avant-garde
cellist who factored in the origins of
'80s house music, giving a particular
shout-out to his compilation album Call-
ing Out of Context.
And he cites Abner Jay's True Story
of Abner Jay as his essential breakup
album.
But perhaps most importantly, 'Taylor
declares Zingerman's "the best deli he's
ever been to, hands-down." He's par-
ticularly fond of the pulled pork sand-
wich.
As simply as the Grizzly Bear bass-
ist likes to put things, the sound he
helps create isn't simple in the least.
And watching the band replicate this
baroque aesthetic live should be noth-
ing short of awe-inspiring.
Because, when it comes down to it,
Taylor's comparison of the band to Rice
Krispies couldn't be more spot-on. They
may not be showy, but put the band in
milk - or in an enclosed concert venue
- and they are sure to snap, crackle and
pop. Which is what they're bound to do
Saturday night at the Michigan Theater.

'DARIUS GAIDEN' (1994), ARCADE
When side scrollers were king

By JACK PORTER
Daily Arts Writer
Even when video arcades were in decline in the
United States in the 1990s, Japanese developers con-
tinued to innovate and produce excellentcoin-operat-
ed games. By the mid-'90s, fighting games came into
their own and began captivating hardcore gamers.
Scrolling shooters (aka "shmups") had already gone
through a golden age with hits like "Gradius" and
"R-Type," and the genre still had life left in it. At the
time, developers favored vertical-scrolling shmups
with faster action and more projectiles on screen,
leading to an arms race which would later come to a
head with games like the manic "DoDonPachi." Even
so, in an age of vertical-scrolling dominance, the
"Darius" series maintained a slower pace and stuck
to the less popular horizontal-scrolling style.
The original "Darius" was like an overly eager
younger brother to "Gradius," with solid but unre-
markable gameplay. It tried to set itself apart with
its three-screen-wide display and enemies inspired
by all manners of marine life. Unfortunately, both
of these elements were nothing more than gim-
micks. Eventually Taito, the development team,
ditched the three-screen format and took the series
more seriously. "Darius Gaiden" elevated the fran-
chise from curiosity to classic with its unforgettable
atmospheres and bosses.
As in any game where the player controls a space
ship that bad things constantly try to destroy, the
objective of "Darius Gaiden" is to not get constantly
killed. Past the first level, non-expert players will
be hard-pressed to not die over and over again.
Not only do enemies come from all sides, but their
unpredictable behavior and kamikaze tendencies
ensure the player never gets too comfortable. The
only way to deal with some foes is to use the ship's
diagonally firing missiles, adding a unique wrinkle
to the gameplay. And as with any shmup, players are
granted a limited number of bombs that wipe out
everything on screen. In this case, the bomb creates
a black hole which sucks in all nearby enemies and
projectiles.
If anything sticks after a run-through of "Darius

Gaiden," it's the bizarre music. The soundtrack is
hard to describe, drawing influence from electron-
ica, new age, jazz and opera. Yes, opera. One of the
game's recurring themes is a female vocalist belting
out incoherent stanzas in an operatic manner. The
other vocal-driven song features more conventional
singing, though sounding like Bjork isn't exactly
conventional either. Add delicate piano, buzzing
synths, discord and heavy reverb into the mix, and
the result is a soundtrack oozing with mystery.
Like the soundtrack, the visuals are quirky and
demand the player's attention. The game doesn't
shy away from using gaudy, clashing colors. The
programmers of "Darius Gaiden" pulled out all the
stops, using multiple background layers, sprite scal-
ing and rotation for pseudo-3-D perspective tricks
If you go back to 1994 to
play shmups, make this
your first choice.
and even transparency effects. Much of the action
takes place in outer space or underwater, but occa-
sional acid-trip moments (especially during boss
fights) break up any monotony in the scenery.
More remarkable, though, are the designs of
the enemies themselves - those gleaming, multi-
segmented, snaggle-toothed, death-dealing robotic
fish. They look appropriately organic, yet sinister.
Best of all are the game's boss monsters, including
the multi-screen-filling, transforming orange squid
named "Titanic Lance," or the pink and blue, cyclo-
pean, tentacle-launching jellyfish dubbed "Curious
Chandelier." The sprites are lovingly detailed works
of art in themselves.
It's no small wonder that "Darius Gaiden" man-
aged to stand out in an overcrowded, formulaic
genre. Taito, in producing this classic, showed that
even the most simple, action-driven games can ben-
efit from clever aesthetic choices.

From Page 1B
"We kind of get ahead ourselves a little bit," hecon-
fessed. "We see the opportunity. So the opportunity
was there and we kind of realized pretty early on in
the process that, shit, this is a pretty big undertaking,
but we managed to cope with it pretty well."
Social Studyz LLC has proven to be more useful
than Lynn and Javer expected. Both agree that their
group has helped them to apply what they're being
taught in class to real world situations. Lynn even
spent his summer working for a music agency, explor-
ing a potential career.
"It's showing us how to really operate a company,"
Lynn said.
"I feel like we're taking a lot of what we're learning
in school and it's great to apply them because a lot of
times in school you're going to read from a textbook
and you're going to learn, but you're not really able to
apply those skills," Javer said.
It seems as though Lynn and Javer have a talent
for promoting and marketing, and they show no
signs of slowing down. Social Studyz LLC has taken
on more projects this year with at least two more
local concerts in the works for this fall. One concert
is scheduled to be at EMU. The other one, slated to
be at the Michigan Theater, is planned for the week-
end of the Ohio State game. Lynn and Javer aren't
allowed to mention any specific artists they're look-
ing to bring to town, but they expect to land more
marquee hip-hop acts.
As if their work with Social Studyz isn't reward-

ing - and time-consuming - enough, Lynn and Javer
now have a new partner (LSA senior Bennett Washa-
baugh) and a new business endeavor to pour their
efforts into: They recently established Go Blue Bev-
erages, a business where students can order all sorts
of drinks and have them delivered to their door at a
discounted price.
At face value, Lynn and Javer seem just like any
other typical college kids. What sets them apart is
their ingenuity, resolve and desireto create the social
and music scene they wanted for themselves and

undertakings with major names (and dollar figures)
on the line doesn't hurt. Putting their fates into their
own hands, the two created their own company, a
time-consuming yet rewarding hobby that enabled
them to put together stadiums filled with students

SMILOVITZ
From Page 3B
That's just the kind of outside-
the-box thinking we can always
expect from a small-town hockey
mom. She doesn't follow your left-
coast, elitist clocks or mainstream
gotcha time zones. Besides, the
governor's got a lot on her plate
right now; those death panel lies
aren't going to spread themselves.
Finally, the Governor can
refuse the dinner if "the winning
bidder is not a suitable bidder
based on her subjective standards
of suitability, professionalism,
background and other factors."
"Suitability?" Just wait until
she sees me in a navy-blue three-
button. "Professionalism?" Since
professions are pretty slim these
days, I think I'm in the clear.
"Background and other factors?"
Jewish, leftist, atheist. Check,
check and double check. Sarah,
here I come!

I imagine ambling into a
redwood-adorned, cabin-themed
restaurant to find the former
Governor and First Dude waiting
for me, both furiously tweeting
away on their Blackberrys. The
food arrives almost immediately,
as do the children: Willow, and
Piper carrying Trig in her arms.
The governor grabs hold of the
youngest and continuously rocks
him throughout the nearly 12
minutes we would spend togeth-
er. It's only then that I notice the
phalanx of photographers lined
up behind me, as a barrage of
shutter clicks capture the former
first family of Alaska in a beatific
recreation of The Last Supper.
Palin spends most of the dinner
tending to the kids, batting away
each question I ask with a "Well,
gosh" or "You betcha." Todd
does most of the talking, and
most of the talking is about snow
machines.
As I snap out of what could only
be described as a Palin-induced
fever dream, I see that the final

bid has been accepted and, drum
roll please, dinner with Sarah
Palin has been sold for $63,500.
This is slightly less than a new
2010 Mercedes-Benz E-Class
($65,000) and significantly more
than what an average American
household makes in a year (around
$50k).
Suddenly, I can feel a tinge of
regret for putting all of my heart,
not to mention one much-missed
kidney, so fully into a dream now
lost. But, I suppose, that's what
chasing down your dreams is
all about: taking a risk and see-
ing where it takes you. You can't
know how things will turn out,
the repercussions that may fol-
low, what giving up everything
you have for a chance at that brass
ring will lead to and you definitely
can't foresee how it all may effect
the rest of your life.
Just ask John McCain.
