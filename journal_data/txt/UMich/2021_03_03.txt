The 
college 
experience 

widely varies, especially amid a 
pandemic that makes having a 
large social circle and in-person 
classes dangerous. But according 
to data obtained by The Michigan 
Daily, 1 in 10 members of the 
University of Michigan Fall 2019 
freshman class came from just 
10 high schools, meaning it’s very 
likely some students in every class 
come into college with already-
established friend groups. 

Though students from over 

2,000 
different 
high 
schools 

enrolled at the University, our 
data shows that nearly half of 
the 2019 incoming class came 

from just 15% of these schools. 
The term “feeder school” is often 
used to refer to schools with 
high volumes of applications to a 
certain university. 

The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 

students from feeder and non-
feeder schools to the University 
around the country to learn how 
their high school experiences 
influenced 
their 
social 
and 

academic transition to college. 
Students 
from 
feeder 
high 

schools in general expressed 
greater 
social 
and 
academic 

comfort, while students from 
high schools where very few 
students attend the University 
said they experienced culture 
shock 
and 
sometimes 
felt 

academically underprepared. 

As one of the most prestigious 

public universities in the United 
States, the University of Michigan 
attracts 
high-achieving 
high 

school students. This includes 
students who took Advanced 
Placement 
or 
International 

Baccalaureate classes — walking 
around campus, it can be hard to 
find a U-M student who didn’t 
take at least one college-level 
course in high school. 

The 
Advanced 
Placement 

Program was founded in 1952 and 
is the most popular way students 
receive college credit for high 
school courses. The AP Program, 
run by the nonprofit organization 
The College Board, offers 38 
courses and exams to more than 
one million students each year. 

The International Baccalaureate 

programs 
were 
founded 
in 

1975, only recently growing in 
gaining popularity in the U.S. 
However, schools that offer IB 
were overrepresented in the 301 
schools with the greatest number 
of applications to the University 
in 2019. 41 of those 301 schools 
offered IB (13.6%), a rate 11% 
higher than the national average.

Admissions 
The Daily’s data shows that 

schools that offer IB made up 
20.8% of acceptances to the 
University from The Daily’s list 
of 301 schools, despite students 
from schools with IB composing 
only 15.3% of all applications. 
The yield rate of students from 
IB schools — the percentage of 
admitted students who attend 
the University — was 62.0%, 
compared to 46.8% for non-IB 
students.

We looked at the 301 high schools with the most 
applicants to the University. Here’s what we found

This article is a part of a data-

driven series in which The Michigan 
Daily obtained records on the top 301 
schools by number of applications to 
the University of Michigan for the Fall 
2019 freshman class through a public 
records request. These data are not 
representative of the entire freshman 
class, nor are the data about the schools 
a perfect aggregate representation of 
all students who attend the University.

The college admissions process 

is a mystery to many — and the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
is 
no 

exception.

At the University, the trend is 

clear: Just under 65,000 high school 
seniors applied for the Fall 2019 
entering class — more than two times 
larger than the 24,000 applicants 
who applied for the entering class 
two decades earlier. The University 
has grown its class size by nearly one-
third, but the growth cannot keep 
up with the increasing application 
volume. The acceptance rate has sat 
around 25% for the last several years, 
less than half of the 55% acceptance 
rate in 2000-2001, according to the 
University’s common data set from 
that year. 

The Michigan Daily obtained 

records on the top 301 U.S. high 
schools by number of applications 
to the University for the Fall 2019 
freshman class through a public 
records request. The data shows 
that 48% of the freshman class 
matriculated from one of these 301 
schools, though the schools represent 
only 15% of the total number of high 
schools with students applying to the 
University.

So what does it take to get into 

an increasingly selective school like 
the University of Michigan? That’s 
the question on tens of thousands of 
minds each year when applications 
for the next freshman class open in 
August. 

For the Fall 2020 entering class, 

75% of entering freshmen received a 
32 or above on the ACT, placing them 
in the 97th percentile of test takers. 
The average freshman’s high school 
GPA was a 3.9.

Admissions officers at schools 

across the nation — including at the 
University, which calls its admissions 
process “holistic” — are quick to 
note that universities are looking 
not only at the complete picture of 
a student, but also how they place 
within the context of their schools 
and communities. 

According to Whitney Bruce, a 

private college admissions counselor 
who specializes in working with 
applicants from Ann Arbor, decisions 
can also be impacted by institutional 
goals. These goals, often unknown 
to applicants, could in turn give 
students who help meet these goals a 
leg up in the admissions process.

Institutional goals can play a larger 

role at selective institutions like the 
University where the freshman class 
could typically be filled two or three 
times over without decreasing the 
average standardized test scores or 
GPA, Bruce said. 

“Creating 
a 
class 
from 
an 

enrollment management perspective 
is more art than science,” Bruce said.

Despite 
hurdles 
caused 
by 

Proposal 2, which in 2006 barred 
the University from considering 
race, gender, ethnicity or nationality 
in admissions, the University has 
still attempted to attain diversity 
within its incoming classes with 
varying degrees of success. Though 
still often criticized as a rich, elite 
university, more than 22% of new 
in-state undergraduates in 2019 came 
from families with incomes under 
$65,000. 

The 
percentage 
of 

underrepresented 
minorities, 

which are students who identify as 
Black, Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 
Hispanic/Latino, Native American 
or 
Native 
Alaskan, 
make 
up 

approximately 15.3% of the 2019 class 
— below the state average of 21%. 

Additionally, 
the 
University 

Record published that more than 15% 
of new students in the 2019 class were 

the first in their families to attend 
college. Erica Sanders confirmed this 
in an email to The Daily.

 “The University of Michigan 

is 
a 
firm 
proponent 
of 
the 

educational value provided by a 
diverse, multicultural and inclusive 
campus 
community,” 
Sander 

wrote. “The mission of the Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions speaks 
to the importance of identifying, 
admitting and enrolling a diverse 
group of students and our holistic 
review process.”

The Daily analyzed the data 

obtained through a public records 
request to shed light on who applies 
to, is accepted by and ends up 
attending the University from the 
60,000-person sea of applicants each 
year. Across the board, we found 
that schools with high numbers of 

applications and admittees each year 
are whiter and richer than national 
and state averages.

One out of every 10 students 

in the class comes from one of 10 

high schools

Despite making up less than 3% 

of schools on The Daily’s list, more 
than 11% of the 2019 freshman class 
came from one of 10 high schools. 
Almost all of these schools — the 
International Academy, Northville 
High School, Novi High School, Troy 
High School, Pioneer High School, 
Huron High School, Rochester 
Adams High School, Bloomfield Hills 
High School and Detroit Country 
Day — are metro Detroit area schools. 

Eight out of nine of these in-state 

schools are public schools, with the 
exception of private school Detroit 
Country Day. The International 

Academy, though public, is also a 
magnet school, meaning students 
must take a test and enter a lottery 
for admission. Pioneer and Huron 
are both part of the Ann Arbor Public 
School System. All nine are highly 
ranked within the state. 

The Bronx High School of Science 

in The Bronx, N.Y., is the only out-
of-state high school in the group of 
10. New York’s public school system 
requires students interested in Bronx 
Science and other “specialized” high 
schools take a test to get in. Of the 
30,000 New York City eighth graders 
who take the specialized high school 
entrance exam, less than 3% of 
test takers made the cut-off to earn 
admission to the high school. 

Michigan outperforms 

other states in applications, 

matriculation

Not only is Michigan the state 

with the most applicants to the 
University, data shows students 
who live in the state are more likely 
to both earn admission and to 
matriculate than students coming 
from out-of-state. 

Ninety-four of the 301 top schools 

were within Michigan, meaning 
most, if not all, of those students 
pay in-state tuition. Despite being 
only one-third of schools on The 
Daily’s list of 301 schools, these 94 
schools contain more than 57% of the 
admitted students and about 68% of 
the enrolled students.

But even within Michigan, there 

are disparities between feeder vs. 
non-feeder schools: Of the total 
enrolled in-state students in the Fall 
2019 freshman class, 63% come from 
one of these 94 schools — despite 
these 94 schools making up only 5% 
of the 1,870 high schools in Michigan.

On The Daily’s list, California 

followed Michigan as the second-
most state with 54 schools, or 18%, 
on the total list. Illinois followed 
with 43, or 14%. New York and New 
Jersey each had around 9% — 27 and 
26 schools, respectively — of the 301 
schools. 

Out-of state students from these 

207 schools make up 32% of the 
enrolled students in 2019, but 69% of 

the total number of applicants. 

You’re most likely to be 

accepted if you go to a magnet 

school

Magnet schools had the highest 

acceptance rates on average — 
more than one-third of applicants 
from these schools were accepted, 
noticeably 
outperforming 
the 

overall 22.9% acceptance rate for 
the class. Despite the fact that public 
magnet school students made up 
only 8.2% of applications from these 
301 schools, applicants from public 
magnet schools made up 10% of total 
acceptances.

Bruce said this statistic would 

make sense given the fact that 
students typically must test-in to 
magnet schools, meaning they 
already 
show 
high 
academic 

performance. 
Michigan’s 

International Academies, schools 
which 
offer 
an 
International 

Baccalaureate 
program 
that 

students must test into, are one 
example of this. If students can earn 
entrance into one, she said, they are 
likely to be competitive candidates 
to the University.

“It’s not that attending IA gives 

you a straighter path to Michigan, it 
gives you a really strong education,” 
Bruce said. “You’ve pre-selected for 
kids who are already going to test 
into a band where their SAT scores 
are competitive with Michigan’s.”

The University does not separate 

magnet schools from public schools 
when 
reviewing 
applications, 

Sanders confirmed to The Daily.

The 301 schools on this list had 

higher acceptance rates on average 
compared to that sub-23% figure 
for the overall Fall 2019 class. Every 
type of school — public magnet 
(32.4%), private secular (30.1%), 
public 
charter 
(29.3%), 
private 

religious (26.1%), public (25.4%) 
and private boarding (25.2%) — 
was above a 25% acceptance rate. 
This means the majority of schools 
outside of The Daily’s list likely had 
an acceptance rate lower than the 
class acceptance rate of 22.9%.

Along with the Wolverine, the 

colors maize and blue and the 
renowned block ‘M,’ the hallmark 
exclamations “Go Blue!” and “Hail!” 
are an integral part of community 
identity 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan. However, several low-
income students who are financing 
their education with the help of 
the Go Blue Guarantee or the High 
Achieving Involved Leader (HAIL) 
scholarship say that for them, 
these phrases carry a much deeper 
meaning.

The total campus disbursement of 

aid for the 2020 fiscal year was over 
$1 billion, which includes federal, 
state and institutional grants as well 
as scholarships, loans and Work-
Study payments. Seventy percent 
of in-state undergraduates receive 

some kind of financial aid and 
one in four pay no tuition at all. In 
particular, this last group includes 
students from lower socioeconomic 
statuses who are either selected for 
the HAIL scholarship or qualify 
for the Go Blue Guarantee, both of 
which fully cover a student’s tuition 
for up to four years. 

Data obtained by The Daily 

regarding the Fall 2019 freshman 
class affirms that among the list 
of the top 301 schools by number 
of applications to the University, 
in schools where more than 17.5% 
of students qualified for free 
lunch, the average matriculation 
rate for admitted students was 
52%. Comparatively, only 40% of 
admitted students from high schools 
where less than 17.5% of students 
qualified for free lunch chose to 
enroll at the University.

aid programs offer low-
income in-state individuals

Following weeks of contention 

over the lack of in-person education 
in Ann Arbor Public Schools, the 
AAPS Board of Education voted Feb. 
24 to begin phasing in a hybrid plan 
for in-person instruction starting 
March 25. 

The district, which has been 

fully remote since March 2020, 
will continue to offer an online 
learning option for families who 
wish to remain online. Around 750 
community members listened in to 
Feb 24’s vote.

“The question has always been a 

matter of when we will return, not if,” 
AAPS Superintendent Jeanice Swift 
said. “We recognize that this time 
has presented significant challenges 
for everyone. Our children need 
in-school learning opportunities, 
our staff and parents who’ve worked 
so valiantly at kitchen tables, across 
this community, and everyone has 
made so many sacrifices.”

On Feb. 22, six Ann Arbor City 

Council 
members 
and 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor signed a public 
letter to the BOE urging AAPS to 
return to in-person and hybrid 
learning. 
Citing 
the 
negative 

repercussions of keeping schools 
closed on students’ mental health 
and wellbeing, the city officials 
asked the BOE to begin serious 
discussions about reopening schools 
as soon as possible.

“The 
extended 
absence 
of 

in-school 
learning 
harms 
the 

emotional and mental state of 
students 
and 
stresses 
already 

stressed families,” the letter reads. 
“These harms are universal, but 
they 
are 
compounded 
among 

homes with young students and 

community members who are 
resource-deprived or who have 
special needs.”

This City Council letter came 

after Swift announced in mid-
January that remote instruction 
would continue indefinitely due 
to confirmed cases of the more 
contagious B.1.1.7 variant among 
University of Michigan students and 
ongoing vaccine shortages. 

The district will begin Stage 

One on March 25 by phasing in 
PreK-12 students who learn in “self-
contained classroom placements,” 
meaning students with special 
needs will work in small groups 
with special education teachers. 
Stage One also includes preschool 
students, Young Five students, 
kindergarten students and small 
groups of students in grades 6-12. 

Stage Two begins on April 5 and 

includes first and second grade 
students. Stages Three and Four 
both begin on April 12 — Stage 
Three allows third, fourth and fifth 
grade students to return, and Stage 
Four begins a phased return of all 
students in grades 6-12. 

On 
Feb. 
23, 
AAPS 
leaders 

announced a partnership with 
Michigan Medicine and Integrated 
Health 
Associates 
to 
quickly 

vaccinate teachers and staff in 
mass vaccination programs this 
coming weekend. Swift said this 
decision significantly impacted the 
reopening recommendation and the 
Feb. 24 vote. 

Swift said vaccinating teachers 

and staff and offering frequent 
testing to students were two key 
components in creating the hybrid 
plan. To mitigate potential spread, 
Swift announced that the district 
will also be able to offer in-school 
rapid testing for students, which 
aligns with one of the new Centers 

for Disease Control and Prevention 
guidelines for reopening schools. 

“This is critically important, as 

an extra layer of protection and of 
confidence for our parents, and for 
students and for staff,” Swift said.

The district is also planning for 

a “robust” summer program, with 
further details being announced in 
March, Swift said. Swift said the 
district is planning for a full return 
to in-school learning in fall 2021.

“I also want to declare our intent 

on a full return to school in the Ann 
Arbor Public Schools this fall, a full 
five days per week of instruction 
for students and staff,” Swift said. 
“Certainly, if there is any unforeseen 
event that would change that 
ability, we would be the first ones to 
immediately be in communication 
with our trustees and with our 
community on any change, but that 
is our intention.”

Some Ann Arbor residents and 

AAPS parents said AAPS’ choice 
to remain all virtual since March 
2020 placed a heavy toll on many 
children, particularly those with 
learning disabilities who rely on 
professionally-trained staff. Ann 
Arbor residents have also raised 
concerns about the disproportionate 
effects COVID-19 has placed on 
families of color, particularly Black 
families, which can further widen 
the disparities that exist for people 
of color.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Board 
of 

Education voted to approve the 
hybrid plan 6-0, with Trustee 
Ernesto Querijero abstaining from 
the vote, saying that the time change 
of the meeting could violate board 
policy.

After the vote, the Board of 

Education reconvened at 7 p.m. to 
hear public comments from over 
200 submissions. All names and 

comments were submitted prior to 
the vote to phase in the hybrid plan 
and were given 15 seconds to be read 
aloud to the Board.

Allison Plagens wrote the school 

year has been very upsetting for 
her family, and urged the Board 
to provide transparency for the 
decision-making process to reopen.

“We feel trapped by your school 

system,” Plagens wrote. “As a low 
income family we have weighed the 
pros and cons of staying in AAPS 
and if we are able to leave due to 
what has happened this school year. 
All my family wants in honesty at 
this point.” 

Yuriy 
Goykhman, 
a 
parent 

of a second grader at Eberwhite 
Elementary School, shared concerns 
about the district’s previous actions.

“With so many empty promises, 

denial of science and compete 
disregard of the needs of a large 
portion of the community AAPS 
leadership and the board have 
lost the trust of the community,” 
Goykhman wrote. “AAPS families 
are leaving the district in droves – 
it is very difficult to find housing in 
nearby districts and all the private 
schools have long waitlists.” 

Though most of the comments 

urged AAPS to approve the hybrid 
plan, 
Nicole 
Turcotte-Ruiz, 
a 

mother of a first grader in AAPS, 
expressed doubt about the success 
of the proposed model to return to 
the classroom. 

“The proposed Hybrid Model 

that has teachers instructing both 
in-person and virtual students 
simultaneously seems ambitious 
at best and more likely downright 
impossible,” Turcotte-Ruiz wrote.

AAPS votes to offer hybrid in-person 

learning beginning March 25

ANN ARBOR

Decision comes after weeks of contention on going back to the classroom

KRISTINA ZHENG

Daily News Editor

In an email to The Daily, 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
does not track graduation rates 
and other indicators of student 
success by high school. 

Business 
freshman 
Marcel 

Wong is one of the many students 
in his class that came to the 
University from Northville High 
School in Northville, Mich. In 
2019, the University accepted 150 
students from Northville High 
School, and 101 chose to attend. 
Wong said that coming from a 
high school where many students 
attended Michigan made it easier 
for him to adjust as a freshman.

“Having 
a 
community 
of 

people not just in your grade, but 
older ones as well that are already 
here and can serve as a potential 
friend or mentor, is definitely a 
big plus with an in-state feeder 
school,” Wong said. 

With a median household 

income just over $110,000 per 
year, many Northville students 
are able to take some of the 21 
Advanced Placement classes or 
the IB curriculum their high 
school 
offers. 
These 
classes 

provide students a way to earn 

college credits in high school and 
often match collegiate academic 
rigor, but the $100 price tag 
on exams poses a barrier for 
some students. According to 
the 
College 
Board 
website, 

some “qualifying” low-income 
students are eligible for fee 
reductions, though the cost is 
still $53 per test.

Wong 
said 
he 
thinks 

his 
AP-packed 
Northville 

curriculum prepared him well 
for college. 

 “I think being exposed to those 

harder classes early and learning 
good 
study 
habits 
definitely 

assisted 
in 
transitioning 
to 

college classes and workload,” 
Wong said.

In contrast, LSA sophomore 

Adelaide Ward went to Ludington 
High School in the small town of 
Ludington, Mich., with a total 
population of just over 8,000. 
Ludington High School offers 
eight AP courses. Out of her 
graduating class of 172, only 
three ended up attending the 
University. Ward said that she 
experienced a difficult transition 
her freshman year because her 
high school did not challenge her 
academically.

“I 
100% 
struggled 

academically during my first year 
at Michigan,” Ward said. “Public 

high school curriculum was 
pretty easy for me, so I wasn’t 
used to having to actually study 
for tests and dedicate a lot of time 
to each class.”

Additionally, Ward said she 

experienced a culture shock 
during her first year at the 
University. Coming from a small 
town, Ward said she had not had 
the same experiences as other 
students who came from bigger 
cities or other regions of the 
world. 

“My high school class of 

172 maybe had 10 people of 
color, and my hometown is 
extremely 
conservative 
and 

heteronormative,” 
Ward 
said. 

“I had little interaction, until I 
came to Michigan, with people 
of 
different 
races, 
religions 

other than Christianity, beliefs 
different from right-leaning, and 
the LGBTQ+ community. I feel 
as if I adjusted pretty quickly, 
though, because I always felt out 
of place in my hometown.”

Business senior Brianna Byard 

also came from a small town in 
Michigan, where she attended 
Tawas Area High School. Like 
Ward, Byard said her high school 
curriculum was not rigorous 
enough to effectively prepare her 
for college. 

“I had just as much of a brain 

as most of my peers (in college), 
it just hadn’t been used in the 
same capacity in my high school,” 
Byard 
said. 
“There 
weren’t 

many academically-challenging 
courses in my high school besides 
three AP courses.”

Byard also said her high 

school provided little support for 
students applying to college, since 
there were few standardized test 
preparation resources available. 

“We had no SAT tutors within 

a 2 hour radius, or any type of 
school-led SAT prep,” Byard said. 

Byard 
said 
she 
felt 

disadvantaged coming from a 
small high school when many of 
her peers at the University had 
attended feeder schools. There 
was a steeper learning curve to 
adjusting to college life because 
of this discrepancy, Byard said.

“The social capital ... my 

peers had, that of knowing 
many students already at school, 
knowing the norms already of 
social life at college or knowing 
what makes a successful college 
student,” Byard said. “I had to 
learn from scratch to cultivate 
my own social capital to enable 
myself to be a part of the 
community.”

Whitmer to ease restrictions on 
indoor dining, residential care
Relaxed regulations come after six straight weeks of declining cases in the state

The state of Michigan will 

ease 
restrictions 
on 
indoor 

dining 
capacity, 
outdoor 

activities and residential care 
facilities beginning Friday, Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced 
at a news conference Tuesday. 

Starting Friday, restaurants 

and bars will be allowed to 
operate at 50% capacity up to 
100 people, an increase from 
25% over the previous six 
weeks. Retail and other indoor 
entertainment 
venues 
will 

also open up to 50% capacity. 
Gatherings at residences can 
now hold 15 people from up 
to three different households 
indoors, with up to 50 people 
outdoors. 

New 
guidelines 
on 
non-

residential gatherings expand 
capacity for events like public 
meetings, with up to 25 people 
now permitted indoors and 300 
allowed outdoors.

Indoor stadiums can hold 

375 patrons if seating capacity 
is under 10,000 and 750 if 
capacity is over 10,000. Outdoor 
entertainment venues can host 

up to 1,000 people. 

However, 
Washtenaw 

County’s limits of ten people 
for indoor gatherings and 25 
people for outdoor gatherings 
remain in effect, according to 
the Washtenaw County Health 
Department website.

“As we continue our vaccine 

rollout and make steady progress 
against the virus, we are taking 
additional 
incremental 
steps 

to re-engage to ensure we are 
protecting our families and 
frontline workers and saving 
lives,” 
Whitmer 
said 
in 
a 

Tuesday press release from the 
Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services. 

According 
to 
Tuesday’s 

press release, COVID-19 cases 
in Michigan declined for six 
straight weeks and are now at 
levels similar to those in early 
October, before the nationwide 
winter spike. Cases in the state 
are now plateauing at a rate of 
around 91 cases per million, with 
a positivity rate of 3.7%. 

The press release also said 

more than two million doses 
of the COVID-19 vaccine have 
been administered in the state. 
MDHHS 
also 
acknowledges 

that more contagious variants 
like the B.1.1.7 variant spreading 

throughout the state could make 
the pandemic more difficult to 
control. 

“We continue to monitor 

the data closely, and based on 
current trends we are taking 
another step toward normalcy,” 
MDHHS 
Director 
Elizabeth 

Hertel wrote in the press release. 
“We 
urge 
Michiganders 
to 

continue doing what works and 
wearing a mask, washing their 
hands and avoiding crowds.”

Restrictions on nursing home 

visitations and activities will 
also ease, as all residents have 
been offered a first dose of 
COVID-19 vaccines and most 
have had a second dose. The new 
Residential Care Facilities Order 
goes into effect immediately and 
encourages communal dining, 
group activities for residents and 
indoor and outdoor visitation in 
all counties. 

Other restrictions such as the 

mask mandate and the pause on 
activities with close physical 
contact without masks continue, 
as well as the directive for 
people to work from home if they 
are able to.

Whitmer 
first 
announced 

the state’s epidemic order in 
November as rising COVID-19 
cases across the state threatened 

to overwhelm hospital capacity. 
The order was initially scheduled 
to last three weeks, but was 
extended nearly three months 
as the situation worsened across 
the country. 

These restrictions began to be 

lifted in January, when Whitmer 
announced that indoor dining 
would be allowed to resume at 
limited capacity on Feb. 1 and 
some extracurricular activities 
for K-12 students would be 
allowed. 

Whitmer’s 
updated 
order 

reflects a larger pattern of state 
governors easing restrictions that 
were in place throughout much 
of the winter, when COVID-
19 
infection 
rates 
peaked. 

Massachusetts 
Gov. 
Charlie 

Baker announced last Thursday 
that the state would move into its 
next reopening phase, with limits 
on indoor dining to be relaxed 
in the coming weeks. Similarly, 
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam 
announced that Virginia would 
ease 
restrictions 
beginning 

Monday.

Librarians, archivists and curators 

unionize, seek to join LEO

Vote to add group to lecturers’ union opened Thursday, will last until March 4

ACADEMICS

Librarians, 
archivists 
and 

curators 
(LACs) 
across 
the 

University of Michigan’s three 
campuses announced on Twitter 
Feb. 22 that they are campaigning 
to join the Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization, 
the 
University’s 

union of non-tenure track faculty. 
Voting on the resolution to 
add LACs to the union opened 
Thursday and will last until 
March 4, according to a statement 
released by LEO.

LEO strives to “increase the 

economic, 
professional, 
social 

and political power of non-tenure 
track faculty” at the University in 
order to better educate students, 
fight for equity across all three 
campuses and promote universal 
access to high-quality public 
education, according to their 
constitution. 

Meredith Kahn, librarian for 

gender and sexuality studies on 
the Ann Arbor campus, helped 
form the organizing committee 
for LACs and told The Daily 
LACs play an important role 
in sustaining the universities’ 
research operations.

“Even though we work in 

different parts of the university, 
and we work with different 
collections, I think what unites 
us is that you really cannot have 
a world-class research university 
without 
world-class 
libraries, 

archives, 
museums, 
galleries, 

gardens, all of those things,” 
Kahn said. “You cannot have 
those things without the labor 
of 
librarians, 
archivists 
and 

curators.”

Lecturers voted to unionize 

in 2004 to secure their rights 

to bargain with the University 
on issues related to health care, 
salaries and job security, among 
other 
provisions. 
LACs 
and 

lecturers are both considered 
non-tenure track faculty, with 
over 10% of LACs having a part-
time appointment as a lecturer 
during their career.

In June, the University’s Board 

of Regents passed a resolution 
recognizing the formal right of 
employees to bargain collectively, 
essentially clarifying how the 
University should interact with 
unions. In the past, extensive 
negotiations between unions and 
University administrators have 
become tense and drawn-out, 
sometimes leading to a stalemate 
between the two groups.

Kahn said the process of 

joining LEO began soon after this 

resolution was passed. 

“(The resolution) signaled to 

us (LACs) that it was maybe a 
little bit safer to pursue forming a 
union,” Kahn said.

To begin, a small group of LACs 

reached out to the American 
Federation 
of 
Teachers 
of 

Michigan to discuss unionizing 
in June. From there, the LACs 
were put in touch with LEO. They 
then spent the summer reaching 
out to LACs from across the three 
campuses to better understand 
the similarities between LACs 
and other non-tenured faculty, 
specifically lecturers.

“What we want is better 

working 
conditions, 
better 

salaries, more parity between the 
three campuses,” Kahn said. “We 
want administration to address 
diversity, equity and inclusion 

more seriously. There’s actually 
quite a bit that we share.” 

LEO President Ian Robinson, 

lecturer 
in 
the 
sociology 

department and in the Residential 
College, told The Daily there was 
a lot of common ground between 
LACs and lecturers and welcomed 
the diversity that LACs would 
bring to the union.

“We have gotten used — at the 

get-go — to being a union that 
values, accommodates and takes 
advantage of diversity rather than 
seeing it as a problem,” Robinson 
said. “The advantages of having 
people with new skills that our 
members don’t have … is very 
compelling for us at the leadership 
level.”

CAMPUS LIFE
Students question 
effectiveness of one-
day “well-being break”

University 
of 
Michigan 

students had their first “well-
being” break — one of two days 
off from class in place of the 
traditional week-long spring 
break — Feb. 24. 

While the day was meant to 

promote student mental health 
without allowing enough time 
for travel, many students told 
The Michigan Daily that the 
one day break did not offer 
them time to engage in wellness 
activities. 
Instead, 
many 

students said they spent the 
time catching up on additional 
homework assignments during 
one of their most stressful 
semesters yet.

In December, the Board of 

Regents approved two one-
day, 
mid-week 
“well-being 

breaks” during the Winter 2021 
semester in hopes of allowing 
students to step away from class 
responsibilities for a day. The 
decision to cancel classes for 
the two mid-week breaks came 
after the University canceled 
Spring Break in an effort to 
mitigate the spread of COVID-
19.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

sophomore 
Ainsley 
Grace 

transferred to the University 
this year and said she hasn’t 
yet stepped foot on campus. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
Grace 
said 
this 
semester’s 

virtual experience has been 
especially isolating, making her 
feel as if she hasn’t had time for 
anything besides schoolwork.

Grace said when one of her 

professors 
assigned 
double 

the typical amount of reading 
and suggested the class could 
complete it on the well-being 
day, it was yet another blow in 
what was already a uniquely 
challenging semester.

“I don’t really think it’s 

enough — I think that it’s hard 
to not have a spring break at 
all,” Grace said. “I just had to 
do homework … I did not take a 
day off.”

In an email to The Daily, 

University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald said the purpose 
of the well-being breaks is to 
provide an opportunity for 
students to step away from the 
online learning environment 
for a day.

“The well-being breaks were 

designed so students would 
have opportunities to spend 
time away from their typical 
spaces and screens as well as 
virtual breaks to meet students’ 
varying needs, while aligning 
with 
public 
health 
safety 

requirements,” 
Fitzgerald 

wrote.

Like 
Grace, 
Engineering 

freshman Satvik Nagpal said he 
has also spent the school year 
studying from home, where he 
said it is difficult to motivate 
himself 
to 
do 
schoolwork 

without social interaction on 
campus.

“Usually work and fun are 

separated, but now it feels 
like it’s almost a blur because 
all of your work is done at 
home,” Nagpal said. “(Remote 
learning) kind of just blends in 
and feels like every day is the 
same.”

Nagpal also said some of his 

friends had assignments due on 
the well-being day, and he spent 
the day working on an EECS 
281 project and studying for a 
quiz for a different class the 
following day.

“It just seems like (professors 

are) 
working 
around 
the 

wellness 
day 
instead 
of 

changing their plans to give us 
more of a day off, instead of just 
a study day or a catch-up day,” 
Nagpal said.

Fitzgerald also wrote that 

well-being days should be an 
opportunity for students and 
instructors to take time off 
from normal school activities.

“While these are not vacation 

days and the university is open, 
academic activity is intended 
to pause to enable students and 
instructors some time to use 
as they find most appropriate,” 

Fitzgerald wrote.

Nagpal added he feels two 

days off during a 13-week 
semester 
is 
insufficient 
in 

supporting 
students’ 
mental 

health and that he would like to 
see students receive more time 
off. 

Engineering 
sophomore 

Zachary Goldston said even 
though 
he 
appreciated 
the 

University’s attempt to provide 
safe time off for students, it was 
not enough time to fully relax.

“I appreciate what initiative 

Michigan is trying to take, 
considering 
they 
removed 

holidays, long weekends and 
spring break from us in order 
to prevent the spread of COVID 
during the winter semester,” 
Goldston 
said. 
“For 
some 

people, this has been more of a 
catch-up day or even a workday 
with some teachers assigning 
readings, even exams or a lot 
of work, since kids are missing 
class today, which personally, 
I think goes against what the 
University was planning to do.”

Goldston said he spent part 

of his well-being day golfing, 
though he acknowledged that 
other students he knew had 
more stressful days. 

“We wanted a day where 

we could, instead of focusing 
on Zoom University, instead 
of focusing on the stressors in 
our lives, take a second just to 
chill, take a deep breath and 
have some time for us to think 
instead of constantly rushing 
around from point to point 
worrying about assignments 
and activities,” Goldston said.

Public Health junior Bushra 

Hassan said she spent her 
well-being day catching up 
on lectures and studying for 
an exam the following day. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
Hassan said she feels virtual 
classes have created additional 
stressors for students.

“Staring at a screen for 

six continuous hours is very 
draining,” Hassan said. “It’s like 
you have to be actively engaged 
the whole time, especially if you 
have your camera on, which is 
very exhausting.”

On Feb. 22, Hassan said 

one of her professors assigned 
two additional lectures with 
an expectation they would be 
completed over the next two 
days, one of which coincided 
with the break. Hassan said she 
reached out to the professor 
to express concerns about the 
assignment but did not receive 
a response. The following day, 
Hassan said her professor told 
the class to watch the lectures 
at two-times speed.

“I 
didn’t 
know 
how 
to 

respond to him, because this is 
a wellness day, and I asked him, 
what does it mean to him. He 
just didn’t answer me,” Hassan 
said.

The Daily reviewed Hassan’s 

email to her professor and 
confirmed its contents, but 
was unable to confirm the 
professor’s statement in the 
class.

Goldston said this semester 

has been a trying experience 
for students and that he hopes 
there are more opportunities to 
relax in the future.

“In reality, I just want one 

day for us to forget that we’re 
in this sort of almost dystopian, 
nightmarish time and just kind 
of get to do something we want 
to do,” Goldston said.

With spring break canceled, many 
struggle with lack of time off from class

ASHA LEWIS/Daily

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced new COVID-19 restrictions at a press conference Tuesday, to take effect Friday.


Students are more likely to 

matriculate if they go to a lower-

income school

Admittees from schools with 

higher percentages of students 
receiving free or reduced lunch, 
a signifier of the family income 
of students within the school, 
correlated to higher matriculation, 
meaning more students who were 
admitted to the University from 
lower-income schools decided to 
attend.

Of the 239 schools on the list with 

data on their free/reduced lunch 
programs, 17.5% of their students 
qualify for free or reduced lunch 
— far below the 2017-2018 U.S. 
national average of 53%. For schools 
on the list with more than 17.5% of 
students on free or reduced lunch, 
52% of admitted students chose to 
attend.

At schools with less than 17.5% of 

students on free or reduced lunch, 
only 40% of admitted students 
chose 
to 
attend. 
With 
less 

students on free or reduced 
lunch, these schools are 
likely in higher income 
areas.

This 
difference 

could point to the 
success of the Go 
Blue 
Guarantee, 

a 
marketing 

program 
that 

began advertising 
in 
2018 
what 

the 
school 
has 

promised for more 
than a decade: In-state 
students whose family 
income 
is 
below 

$65,000 and with assets 
below $50,000 will not pay 
anything toward tuition for four 
years. University President Mark 
Schlissel has said in the past that 
the purpose of this initiative was to 
increase socioeconomic diversity on 
the Ann Arbor campus. 

But the higher yield rate among 

lower-income 
schools 
is 
still 

surprising given the relatively high 
cost of attendance at the University. 
LSA, the University’s largest school, 
has an in-state tuition between 
$15,000 and $18,000 depending 
on class standing. Without aid, the 
University’s Ann Arbor campus has 
the most expensive tuition out of 
all public colleges in the state. Still, 
Bruce said that in-state families 
consider the University a “huge 
value” because it is notably less 
expensive than the sticker prices 
of many out-of-state or private 

institutions.

For example, out-of-state tuition 

at the University ranges between 
$52,000 and $56,000 per year 
depending on class level — more 
than double the $21,000 average 
cost of tuition for an out-of-state, 
public college, according to U.S. 
News. 

White students are 

overrepresented at high schools 

with high application volume
277 schools on The Daily’s list 

provided demographic data. Of 
these 
schools, 
white 
students 

make up the majority at four out of 
every five schools. This shows that 
the current demographics of the 
undergraduate population — which 
is majority white — are unlikely to 
significantly shift. 

White 
students 
currently 

make up approximately 55% of 
the 
undergraduate 
community, 

whereas just under 68% of the 277 
schools are majority white. This 
does not mean that every student 
who enrolls from these schools 
is 
white, 

but 
it 
does 

show that many of the schools the 
University pulls heavily from have 
more white students filling their 
classrooms than minority students.

Out of these 277 schools, only 

one school is a majority multirace, 
four are majority Hispanic, 24 
are majority Asian and four are 
majority Black. Three out of the 
four schools that have a majority 
Black population are in Michigan. 
Most majority Asian schools are in 
California, New Jersey and New 
York, and most majority Hispanic 
schools are in Illinois.

Schools have noticeably 

higher family incomes than 

average

Students at these 301 schools 

have higher family incomes than 

both state and national averages. 
The average median household 
income for the Michigan public 
schools on this list is just over 
$75,000, about 20% higher than 
the average Michigan household 
income of $57,000.

The average median household 

income 
for 
out-of-state 
public 

schools on our list is just over 
$128,000 — almost double the 
national household median income 
of $69,000.

These 
numbers 
are 
not 

surprising given that the average 
family income of a student at the 
University is $154,000. Nine times 
more students at the University 
come from families with household 
incomes in the top 5% nationally 
than the bottom 20%, according to a 
2017 New York Times study. 

But The Daily’s data shows that 

the feeder schools the University 
looks to in filling its incoming class 
every year even further skew upper-
class. These schools typically have 
more resources, such as more robust 
Advanced 
Placement 
offerings 

and access to standardized test 
preparation, that make attending a 

selective college more accessible.

But just because students 
from higher socioeconomic 

backgrounds 
enroll 
at 

the University doesn’t 
mean 
there 
are 

disproportionate 
recruitment 
efforts 

for them, said Paul 
Robinson, 
interim 

vice provost for the 
Office of Enrollment 
Management 
and 

University 
registrar. 

Robinson wrote in an 
email to The Daily that the 
undergraduate admissions 

team visits 500 in-state high 

schools and 500 out-of-state high 
schools that represent a wide range 
of income levels in a typical year. 
On top of this, the team visits an 
additional 500 college fairs and 
family nights, he said.

“The schools and students we 

interact with represent a diverse 
spectrum of identities, experiences 
and 
perspectives,” 
Robinson 

wrote. “In fact, the intended 
purposes of programs like the Go 
Blue Guarantee and the HAIL 
Scholarship are to engage and 
financially support students and 
families who may believe a U-M 
education is out of their reach 
and who often come from schools 
or 
communities 
that 
haven’t 

traditionally sent us students.”

The disparity between the 

two matriculation rates suggests 
that 
students 
from 
lower 

socioeconomic status districts are 
more likely to accept their offer 
of admission from the University 
than students from more affluent 
areas. Though there is no concrete 
answer as to why this is, The Daily 
talked to several current U-M 
students from lower-income areas 
across the state, and found their 
decisions to attend the University 
were all predominantly based 
on two things: affordability and 
financial aid.

HAIL! open doors for 

disadvantaged students

The HAIL scholarship program 

was first announced in 2015 to 
attempt to increase socioeconomic 
diversity at the University’s Ann 
Arbor campus. In an email to The 
Daily, University spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen wrote that the 
scholarship continues to be offered 
annually 
to 
high-achieving, 

in-state, low-income students who 
are selected using data provided to 
the University through a special 
memorandum by the Michigan 
Department of Education.

More than 1,000 students have 

accepted the full-tuition HAIL 
scholarship over the past five 
years. A 2018 paper co-authored 
by Public Policy professor Susan 
Dynarski 
revealed 
that 
the 

scholarship originated as a social 
experiment in which the financial 
aid that low-income students 
would already have been entitled 
to was simply “re-packaged” in 
personalized, eye-catching maize 
and blue striped envelopes. The 
students’ 
financial 
aid 
offers 

were advertised as a whole new 
scholarship which was guaranteed 
to them upon admittance to the 
University. 

“Students in the study would 

have been eligible for at least free 
tuition and fees in the absence of 
this intervention,” Dynarski wrote 
in the research paper.

Though the HAIL scholarship 

did not provide any new financial 
aid, both the results of the study 
and personal attestations from 
students who are currently part of 
the HAIL program emphasize its 
undeniable effect on encouraging 
lower-income 
students 
to 

matriculate.

LSA 
sophomore 
Brittney 

Schaefer, 
HAIL 
scholarship 

recipient, was the first student 
from Charlton Heston Academy 
in St. Helen, Mich., to be accepted 
into any Big Ten school. Besides 
her scholarship and acceptance 
becoming a local symbol of the 
opportunities available to students 
from Charlton Heston, Schaefer 
said 
HAIL 
was 
personally 

meaningful because it financially 
allowed her to honor a promise 
she had made to her mother, who 
passed away when she was 13.

“When I was 12, I always told 

(my mom) that I was going to U 
of M, because when you’re a kid 
you’ll say anything,” Schaefer said. 
“So my first thought when I got the 
scholarship and got in was, ‘I’m 
actually going to fulfill my promise 
to her.’”

Schaefer said if she had not 

received the notice that she had 
gotten the HAIL scholarship prior 
to the early action deadline, her 
financial situation would have 
discouraged her from applying to 
the University altogether. Now, 
however, Schaefer said she could 
not imagine who she would be 
without the experiences she has 
gained as a Wolverine.

“(Attending 
the 
University) 

has definitely taken me out of my 
comfort zone and has given me the 
education and the opportunities 
that I really wanted,” Schaefer 
said. “It’s just opening so many 
doors for me.”

LSA senior Caleb Adams, who 

attended Bark River-Harris High 
School in Harris, Mich., also 
received the HAIL scholarship. 
As just one of the two students 
who applied to the University from 
his graduating class of 37, Adams 
echoed Schaefer’s gratitude for the 
scholarship, which also enabled 

him to financially consider the 
University as a post-secondary 
option.

“I grew up a Michigan fan, but 

I didn’t consider going to college 
there before (the scholarship),” 
Adams said. “Now, Michigan has 
sent me to Amsterdam to study 
abroad. Last fall I had lunch with 
George Bush’s Secretary of State, 
Condoleezza Rice. Opportunities 
like that I just wouldn’t have had 
at other universities.”

Though Schaefer and Adams 

account for just two data points 
in 
Dynarski’s 
massive 
study, 

their experiences corroborate the 
overall trend. In the conclusion 
section of the published 
study, 
Dynarski 

wrote 
that 

students 
who 
received 

the 
HAIL 
scholarship 

packet were more than twice as 
likely to apply and enroll at the 
University as in-state students in 
similar socioeconomic situations 
who were not sent personalized 
financial aid information or a 
scholarship.

“We 
conclude 
that 
an 

encouragement to apply, paired 
with a promise of aid, when 
communicated 
to 
students 

and 
influential 
adults, 
can 

substantially close income gaps in 
college choices,” Dynarski wrote.

Go Blue Guarantee 

strives to encourage greater 

socioeconomic diversity

According 
to 
University 

President Mark Schlissel, the 
HAIL 
research 
project 
was 

instrumental in designing the 
program he would be most proud 
of implementing within his first 
five years as president: the Go 
Blue Guarantee. Going into effect 
in the Winter 2018 semester, 
the guarantee has since ensured 
free tuition to admitted in-state 
students whose total household 
income is up to $65,000 with 
assets of up to $50,000.

Like the HAIL scholarship, the 

Go Blue Guarantee was not the 
result of additional financial aid to 
lower-income students, but merely 

an advertising campaign 

to more effectively 

communicate 

existing 
aid 

opportunities.

The philosophy behind 

the guarantee was derived from 
HAIL’s success with increasing 
low-income student application 
rates 
by 
advertising 
specific 

financial 
aid 
promises 
when 

high school students begin the 
college application process, but 
the Go Blue Guarantee aims to 
do this on an even more massive 
scale. Whereas HAIL promises 
full-tuition to a selected few, the 
Go Blue Guarantee means that 
anyone who meets the guarantee’s 
residency, admission and financial 
need requirements automatically 
knows they will have their tuition 
covered by the University.

University spokeswoman Kim 

Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
to The Daily that the University 
is attempting to replicate HAIL’s 
efficacy regarding informative, 
personalized 
mail 
with 
the 

guarantee by increasing student 
awareness about the program 
statewide.

“We… mail a brochure to in-state 

high school juniors describing 
Michigan’s 
affordability 
and 

the 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee 
to 

create greater awareness of the 
initiative,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“There is also a robust marketing 
campaign to increase awareness 
among Michigan residents of the 
GBG.”

LSA junior Miranda Santos said 

she was first made aware of the 
Go Blue Guarantee when she saw 
a U-M Facebook advertisement 
for it while she was a student 
at Pinconning High School in 
Pinconning, Mich. Santos said 
she had not seriously considered 
college altogether for most of her 
life since no one in her family 
had gone to a university, and the 
graduates she knew from her high 
school typically dropped out for 
financial reasons after a year or 
two.

“I didn’t have money, so college 

was something that wasn’t even 
on my mind until my junior year,” 
Santos said. “Then finding out 
about (the guarantee) and that I 
don’t have to pay for tuition was 
just like, holy crap, I can actually 
get a degree.”

Additionally, Fernando Barrera, 

a college advisor for Lincoln 
Park High School — where at 
least 50% of students qualify for 
free or reduced lunch — said the 
Go Blue Guarantee inherently 
sends a supportive message to his 
students. 

“A lot of times, students from 

low-income backgrounds may feel 
daunted by going to big universities 
like Michigan and think that there 
aren’t going to be other people that 
come from similar backgrounds,” 
Barrera said. “These types of 
programs create a more welcoming 
environment.”

But there has been activism 

to 
expand 
the 
guarantee’s 

“welcoming 
environment” 
to 

include the University’s Dearborn 
and Flint campuses, which have 
more lower-income students as 
well as more minority students. 
The One University Campaign, a 
coalition of students and faculty 
who advocate for equity across 
U-M’s 
three 
campuses, 
has 

protested for GBG’s expansion 
for more than a year. In January, 
the Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs voted in 
support of 1U’s initiative. 

As of the end of February, 

however, there have been no new 
conversations on the topic. When 
asked about the possibility of 
expanding the Go Blue Guarantee 
to the other two campuses, 
Broekhuizen wrote to The Daily 
that the program was created 
specifically with the Ann Arbor 
campus in mind.

“The Go Blue Guarantee was 

created to address a specific 
concern — increasing access to the 
Ann Arbor campus by students 
from more diverse socioeconomic 
families,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 

“The program is designed to 
help those students overcome 
the perceived barriers that they 
cannot afford UM-Ann Arbor 
whose tuition and fees are greater 
than that of UM-Dearborn and 
UM-Flint.”

For 
now, 
LSA 
sophomore 

Andrea 
Behrmann, 
who 
is 

also a recipient of the Go Blue 
Guaranteed,, said she just feels 
fortunate that her hard work in 
high school and college will pay 
off with a reputable degree and 
fewer student loans.

“Overall (the guarantee) is just 

so important for reaching people 
who grew up in lower-income 
area communities,” Behrmann 
said. “It gives students like me the 
same opportunity to go to U of M 
as anyone else.”

Rina Hou, Kinesiology and 

LSA freshman, attended the 
International 
Academy 
IB 

school in Troy, Mich. Hou 
said she believes the program 
definitely helped her get into the 
University. 

“Their whole goal is to 

make sure that you’re a 
well-rounded student so 
that your application 
stands out,” Hou said. 

Kinesiology 

freshman 
Regan 

Lee took eight AP 
classes 
in 
high 

school. She said her 
choice to take AP 
courses over regular 
classes most likely 
made her appealing as 
a candidate. 

“I think colleges like 

to see that you want to get 
ahead in your studies,” Lee 
said. “Especially in the fields 
that you’re interested in. For 
example, I wanted to go pre-
med, so I took AP Bio.” 

Erica Sanders, director of 

undergraduate 
admissions, 

wrote in an email to The Daily 
that 
admissions 
officers 
do 

take into account how many 
challenging courses a student 
took 
in 
high 
school 
when 

reviewing 
their 
application. 

However, Sanders emphasized 
that the University also looks at 
applicants’ extracurricular and 
co-curricular activities.

“We encourage students to 

challenge themselves in the areas 
where they do their best work 
academically,” Sanders wrote. 
“While also allowing themselves 
the opportunity to engage in 
extracurricular 
activities 
or 

other responsibilities — part-
time jobs, volunteer work and 
assistance with responsibilities 
at home — that create a well-
rounded student.”

AP versus IB

As IB gains popularity in the 

U.S., more students will have the 
opportunity to choose between 
the program and the typical AP 
curriculum.

Hou said she thinks the IB 

program is a lot less flexible 
than taking AP classes. 

“When you’re in an IB school, 

you don’t have a lot of choice,” 
Hou said. “You just have to 
take all the required courses — 
there’s little room for your own 
choice. For AP, you really get to 

choose and decide what to take 
for college credit.” 

LSA junior Julia Trautmann 

disagreed, saying IB fostered a 
range of skills not included in 
the AP program.

“It’s 
so 
interdisciplinary 

and requires so much time 

management 
and 
projects 

outside of your core classes,” 
Trautmann said. “I do think it 
helps a lot and could become 
more popular in the future.” 

Sanders 
wrote 
that 
all 

college-level high school courses 
— including AP and IB classes 
— are seen as equally rigorous 
on 
a 
prospective 
student’s 

application.

“AP, IB and dual enrollment 

coursework are all evaluated 
as 
advanced 
curriculum 

selections,” 
Sanders 
wrote. 

“That, when selected in the 
areas where the student does 
their best work, can enhance the 
student’s application.”

Preparation for the 

University of Michigan 

Trautmann said being an IB 

student prepared her for college 
in ways other programs could 
not have. 

“We had a lot of verbal 

assessments and there were a lot 
of written assignments too, so I 
thought it definitely helped with 
public speaking and writing 
skills,” Trautmann said.

Sanders agreed, noting in 

her email that participation 
in 
college-level 
classes 
can 

be important preparation for 
succeeding in introductory-level 
courses at the University.

“Success 
in 
college 
prep 

coursework, 
which 
includes 

advanced curriculum selections 

like AP, Honors, IB and dual-
enrollment courses can assist 
students by introducing the 
rigor and pace that is similar to 
introductory college courses,” 
Sanders wrote. 

Lee said she felt her AP 

experience 
in 
high 
school 

prepared her for the rigor of 
college and allowed her to enter 

freshman year with credits to 

use toward her degree.

“I feel pretty well 
prepared to be here, 
especially because I 

did receive a decent 
amount of credit 
for all of my AP 
exams,” Lee said. 
“So, 
that 
was 

definitely helpful 
to get ahead and 
… it allowed me 
to not have to go 
through 
all 
the 

prereqs.”

On campus, there 

has also been discussion 

about 
the 
benefits 
of 

AP and other college credit 
receiving courses from high 
schools, particularly because the 
University’s class registration 
system allows students with 
a higher number of credits to 
register 
earlier, 
advantaging 

students who’ve taken AP or IB.

What if neither program 

was available?

School districts located in 

rural areas, areas with a lower 
average family income or areas 
with a higher percentage of racial 
minorities often have difficulty 
funding programs like AP and 
IB. As a result, some students 
said they did not have access 
to these advanced courses in 
high school at all, making them 
feel underprepared compared 
to students from larger or 
wealthier school districts. 

Recent LSA graduate Clare 

Mayes attended a high school 
in rural southwest Michigan 
that offered only one AP class. 
Mayes, whose graduating class 
was only 63 people, said the lack 
of access to advanced courses 
led her to struggle academically 
when came to the University.

“I came in feeling really 

underprepared,” Mayes said. “I 
really struggled in a lot of intro 
courses that it seemed like a lot 
of my peers had already been 
exposed to because they had 
been in AP classes or anything 
like that.”

This weekend, the South Asian Awareness 

Network hosted their 19th annual conference 
“Rising Tides: Pulling Together to Push 
Boundaries.” While this year’s virtual setting 
looked different from previous round-table 
dialogues at the Michigan League, the social 
justice awareness organization delivered a 
rather engaging program with discussions of 
activism, identity and breaking boundaries. 

Over the course of three days, the conference 

shifted between speaker talks and facilitated 
breakout room sessions. Speakers included 
Hoda Katebi, Chicago-based organizer and 
creative; independent entrepreneur Ankita 
Bansal; state Rep. Ranjeev Puri, D-Canton; 
author and entrepreneur Suneel Gupta; 
entrepreneur and influencer Shivani Bafna; 
and Rukmini Vijayakumar, artistic director 
and choreographer. 

During talks, attendees were encouraged to 

engage in the chat with virtual reactions and 
comments that each speaker could interact 
with, and the virtual breakout sessions during 
dialogues offered an easy way for speakers and 
moderators to enter rooms and speak directly 
to attendees. The stimulating perspectives 
of everyone involved made the transition to 
Zoom fairly seamless, and is a testament to the 
assiduous efforts of the entire SAAN team. 

DAY 1: FRIDAY, Hoda Katebi — Keynote 

Address

The conference started off with a keynote 

address from Chicago-based abolitionist 
organizer Hoda Katebi on Friday evening. 
Katebi spoke about approaches to abolition 
and the inherently political nature of fashion 
from her home, with her cat on standby. 

As Katebi explained, “fast fashion is 

necessary under capitalism,” and “violence 
(most 
often 
gender-based 
violence) 
is 

necessary for fast fashion.” As she took us 
through the steps of the global clothing 
production cycle and the corresponding 

exploitation at each level, she quickly 
condemned ethical and sustainable fast 
fashion as “fake news.” 

Katebi swiftly connected the performative 

reformation of fashion companies to that 
of the military and its very performative 
notions of democracy, alluding to the deep 
interconnections of all institutions in which 
individual choice is never the sole determining 
factor. She called out the perpetuated narrative 
of trying to “buy the revolution” through 
brands that preach sustainability and instead, 
she encouraged what she calls “collaborative 
intersectional movement building” which 
requires taking a step back and holding the 
institutional structures accountable. 

As consumers of goods under capitalism 

wherein we “(are) not supposed to know what 
happens on … production floors,” our power, 
she said, lies in our ethos. Consumer power 
lies in what we can and cannot control, and 
she attests to this with one final sentiment: “I 
might use plastic straws, but I’m still trying to 
defund the military.” 

DAY 2: SATURDAY, Ankita Bansal — 

Unapologetic Pursuits: Rise of a Phoenix

On Saturday, Ankita Bansal started off 

the first full day of programming with a talk 
about her journey from starring in the Netflix 
reality TV show “Indian Matchmaking” to 
expanding her global denim brand THERE! 
with her sister Gayatri. In her first-ever talk 
to a university crowd, she opened up about 
her failures in the entrepreneurial world and 
encouraged all attendees to embrace their 
“unapologetic pursuits,” which remained the 
central theme throughout her address. 

“I wear my failures like a badge,” Bansal 

beamed as she told the audience about the 
great impact each one of her deterences had 
on her career and in her personal life. In one 
breakout room dialogue, attendees talked 
about how Bansal’s sentiment of embracing 
the lessons of failure is often lost in the 
pressures of hustle culture. 

In picking up many of her insights on the job, 

Bansal preached the importance of “bring(ing) 

in a personal aspect when growing a brand.” 
She talked about the value of community and 
the importance of authenticity, saying that 
“building a community takes a lot of heart 
and soul, not money.” For THERE!, this 
meant unique size customizations and open 
communication with individual clients. 

Alongside her business journey, Bansal 

is passionate about cultivating good habits 
and daily routines, warning against the lack 
of fulfillment from a 24/7 hustle. “When you 
start your day with (just) working, it leaves 
you in a space where you are not satisfied,” she 
said. 

With her closing workshop, Bansal 

encouraged attendees to pursue a new activity 
with a more self-oriented goal in mind for the 
next 21 days through a social media challenge 
collaboration with SAAN. 

Ranjeev Puri — Dichotomy of Activism 

within South Asian Generations

Newly-elected state Rep. Ranjeev Puri, 

D-Canton spoke about his identity in relation 
to politics, the importance of a culturally-
competent campaign and the dangers of the 
monolithic South Asian political identity. 

As the first person of color to represent 

the 21st District of Michigan, Puri walked 
through his campaign strategies to effectively 
reach older generations of the South Asian 
community in the diverse city of Canton 
through engagement with ongoing cultural 
and religious occasions. He delved into the 
inherent politics of “desi dinner parties,” and 
he expressed the need for getting those strong 
opinions at the dinner table out to the ballots. 

Despite his status as the first Sikh-

American in Michigan State Legislature, 
he drew a very necessary distinction in his 
political identity: “I’m not a South Asian 
legislator, I’m a legislator who happens to be 
South Asian.” He contended that in resisting 
the monolithic South Asian political identity, 
the diaspora must lean into the core values of 
our identities and experiences to then speak 
out to all people. 

“To a lot of people,” he stated, “we are just 

brown,” but Puri said his rather progressive 
agenda got a lot of pushback from older Desi 
generations who have anti-Black Lives Matter, 
anti-pride and anti-immigrant sentiments. 
Puri explained that he understood these 
outdated attitudes to be rooted in their own 
respective experiences. 

Through knowledge of struggle and feat, 

older generations of Desis taught younger 
ones to be good and do good in the society 
they are brought up in, Puri said. However, 
he encouraged younger generations to take 
charge of the political narratives in the South 
Asian diaspora by advocating for those same 
values for all people because “the (only) way 
we see our community succeed is when we see 
all communities succeed.” 

Suneel Gupta — Finding Happiness in 

Your Work

As the final speaker of Saturday’s program, 

entrepreneur and author of his new book 
“Backable,” Suneel Gupta highlighted the 
difference between career and craft, only 
the former of which can be discovered on a 
LinkedIn profile. 

He discussed a three-word framework for 

navigating through purpose and meaning in 
life: definition, devotion and detachment. He 
spoke about valuing character over reputation, 
prioritizing consistency over time and falling 
in love with the problem over its solution. 

His perspective on finding your Dharma, 

or calling, hit home for many of the students 
as they continued to self-reflect on attachment 
to career-based identities in breakout sessions. 
Gupta suggested a familiar failure-embracing 
approach to finding happiness in your work, 
saying “the opposite of success is not failure, 
it’s boredom.” 

He concluded with a workshop activity 

asking attendees to add something they want 
to learn in 2021 to a shared Google Document. 
After responses had stopped, he asked everyone 
to write their emails next to at least five items 
in the growing “To Learn List” that they could 
provide guidance for. As email links popped 
up next to statements like “I want to learn how 

to practice mindfulness” and “I want to learn 
how to speak another language,” attendees 
felt overwhelmed with how easy it had been 
to find guidance and seek out help. Members 
expressed their appreciation for the exercise 
and Gupta left them with one final push: “Let’s 
go do the things that make us feel alive.”

DAY 3: SUNDAY, Shivani Bafna — 

Sharing Your Authentic “Why” on Social 
Media

As the first speaker for Sunday’s program, 

influencer and University of Michigan 
alum Shivani Bafna talked about her unique 
journey in the entertainment industry and the 
role social media plays in it. 

Originally a pre-med student, Shivani 

completely switched her career path as she 
realized what she really wanted to do. Soon 
after her graduation from the University 
in 2018, Bafna took the leap and moved to 
Mumbai, India, to pursue her career within 
Bollywood where she entirely immersed 
herself into industry work, from modeling to 
interviewing to creating social media content. 

She turned to her social media platform to 

share her journey because as she said, “There 
are so many … experiences that we gloss 
over that are crucial to our journey.” She 
encouraged an awareness for all the steps 
that influence the journey — both the good 
and the bad. While she agrees that “what we 
share on social media is a curated highlight 
reel of the best wins of our lives,” she 
proposes more vulnerability in storytelling 
one’s journey online, sharing the equally 
influential failures along the way. 

In the technology-driven age of ever-

changing social media trends and followings, 
one breakout room dialogue debated the 
downsides to “making Instagram casual 
again.” Attendees also discussed the pressures 
that influencers like Bafna are faced with as 
she strives to tell her story and create a more 
empathetic space in the online world.

In my sister’s university library in Corpus 

Christi, Texas, I sat isolated behind a stack of 
books, crying as I lay on the dirty carpet with 
my sneakers propped up on the bookshelf 
and my headphones in, playing Solange’s 
“Cranes in the Sky.” Her music has always felt 
like an escape, and this particular moment 
culminated into release. For a good hour, I 
cried there –– I was reaching a new point in 
my life in which I would soon begin college 
without an idea of how I would pay for it. It 
was the pain of all my fears synthesizing.

The pressure of reality meeting the 

pressure of the divine feminine. That is a 
Solange song. That is me. 

My mamí taught me to be a girl on the run, 

like a blood rite. Though I only met her briefly 
in the flesh, I learned at a young age to pack my 
bags in a night and flee at a moment’s notice. 
Fleeing felt like liberation, and “Cranes in the 
Sky” sings to the absence of a destination that 
I found so iconic to my journey. In her feature 
on the “Exploder” podcast, the 34-year-
old Houston native explains these lyrics 
and describes her fleeing experiences. She 
discusses not only hyperbolically traveling 70 
states in the physical form, but also 70 states 
of mind — all in search of the feeling of home. 
She explains not being able to find a home, 
something we can all relate to and embrace. 
It is that realization when you hit a certain 
age of no return and suddenly home doesn’t 
feel like home anymore. That fleeting feeling 
of normalcy that you start to encounter as 
you become an adult, the result of leaving 
what you know for constant new beginnings 

— the forever pursuit of the peace that comes 
with home. She has a way of humanizing 
herself in her songs, and in this one she 
grounds herself into artfully exploring the 
complexities of being in a million different 
places at once, searching and longing for 
that comforting feeling of finding peace in 
one particular place. In “Cranes in the Sky,” 
she sings the lyric, “Don’t you cry, baby,” and 
when I first heard this, I was overcome with 
a sense of rational comfort –– meant to evoke 
feelings of community, the uplifting spirit 
of family or friends, all of which can guide 
you out of a depression that otherwise can 
become seemingly eternal. She explains in 
the podcast that this is something she learned 
from her mom –– that “on the third day (of 
a depression) you get your ass up and you 
ride.” Inspired by her mother, the lyrics are 
an endearing way of expressing the need to 
hold yourself together at times and move on 
from your strife. The beautiful harp playing in 
this song unites a sense of feminine regalness 
and peaceful serenity. Factors that all go into 
shaping the song into a beautiful, comforting 
tune in which you can find home. The entirety 
of Solange’s album A Seat at the Table, which 
includes “Cranes in the Sky,” is masterful with 
songs that praise Black excellence and power 
through artful ballads and interludes. They 
provide a tranquil sense of home found in the 
here and now. 

Solange makes my running feel like my 

own personal love story; like a short film on 
the dos and don’ts of self-love. Her harmonies 
and high notes singing to me, my grace and 
giving way to the wings on which I soar. My 
chosen background music to the soundtrack 
of coming of age. Her music video for “Binz” 
does something very similar for me –– the 

filmography feels genuine, personal; she 
dances playfully in her home to her lyrics. 
The video first caught my attention while I 
was in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The city had 
an interesting type of chaos to it. The beaches 
often had people covering every inch of the 
shore, and streets were lined with dancing 
adults and children alike, moving freely and 
effortlessly. You might even catch a soccer 
match happening down the narrow streets 
or walk by as firecrackers are popped at 
your feet. It was booming with culture and 
excitement, yet for me, it was a lot to take in. 
However, chaotic as it was, I still felt this 
sense of loneliness as I began to explore 
myself in this new place that grew to feel like 

a home away from home. I was building a 
connection to my spirituality and soul, and 
my internship allowed me to feel like my life 
was full of meaning and purpose. The work I 
did was with youth learning and unlearning 
the effects of different kinds of inequality and 
sustainable living. However, I was one of the 
only Americans in my cohort, which comes 
with a lot of weight. I was struggling to balance 
the demands of nonprofit work and leisure, 
all while maneuvering three languages and 
cultures. Not to mention I was over four 
thousand miles from home in a land foreign 
yet familiar, with its tropical energy reminding 
me of Cuba. It was a difficult and interesting 
time, and Binz took me somewhere new:

“I just wanna wake up to the suns and Saint 

Laurent

Hundred thousand dollars on the fronts 

and the blunts

I just wanna wake up on goodbye, only I.”
This song evokes a solitude that feels 

peaceful and easy; through it, I learned to find 
home in the self. In moments dancing along 
the beach coast or swimming at dusk or crying 
in the shower on long nights, I found home. 
But most of all this song taught me to have a 
happy outlook on life. It made living feel a little 
easier.

On an internship application I skimmed 

over recently, one of the essay prompts asked 
me this: “Explain the importance of _____ in 
today’s society.” Several words immediately 
came to mind. Love, respect, empathy. 
Accessibility and accountability. Grassroots 
organizing. Healing. Then, grief. 

But as I put my pen down, I realized that 

perhaps “grief” was not the right word. I 
thought about how many of us have faced 
more than enough grief to last a lifetime — a 
grief stemming not only from loss but also 
from silence and injustice. Many have faced 
grief spanning months, years and generations 
— some even since the birth of our nation. 
Some have been born into, and have left, this 
world carrying a grief I will never be able to 
understand or attest to.

As I revised this sentence, I then reserved 

the word “grief” for a more nuanced form: 
“grieving.” The word as a verb, as a process, 
as a doing unto oneself … To be grieved. To 
respond to something that has caused intense 
distress and sorrow. To be arrested by a 
conviction for action, one which is born of an 
anguish that cannot be neglected and should 
not be prolonged but must only be resolved.

It grieves me to think about a lot of things.

It grieves me to think about those whom I 
may have hurt, however pure my intentions 
may have been. It grieves me to think about 
the problematic habits of my own Korean-
American 
community 
that 
have 
been 

normalized. It grieves me to think about the 
moments in which I have chosen to assume the 
safe role of a bystander rather than be an ally. 
It grieves me to think about the often-painful 
and still-uncorrected history that I have lived 
through and thus, ultimately contributed to 
writing. 

But are we, the American public and 

especially those who lead this nation, grieved? 

Does it grieve us to think about our 

choice to incarcerate almost 120,000 
Japanese Americans in the name of 
“military security” in 1942? Does it grieve 
us to think about the racial slurs hurled at 
these families, the blinds drawn on train 
rides to these camps for protection from 
onlookers who sought to attack them? Does 
it grieve us to think that the Supreme Court 
ruled against Fred Korematsu — who 
refused to abide by the government’s orders 
to relocate to a camp — and still has yet to 
officially overturn the decision? Does it 
grieve us to think about the racialized fear 
and hysteria that we have, and have had, 
the capacity to hold? 

It may grieve us. But does it grieve us 

enough to refuse employing the very same 
tactics of anti-Japanese sentiment during 
World War II against Muslims and Muslim 
Americans today, only rewording the guise of 
“military threat” to that of a “national terror 
threat?” Did it grieve the Supreme Court who, 
despite their repudiation of the Korematsu 
ruling, still voted to uphold the analogously 
racist Muslim travel ban in 2018? 

Does it grieve us to think about what took 

place on Jan. 6 of this year? Does it grieve us 
to think about a faith in white supremacy so 
strong that it would drive a group of people 
to scale the walls and smash the windows of 
the Capitol? Does it grieve us to think about 
those present in the Capitol building, streets of 
Washington, D.C. and even onlookers across 
the country seized in a moment of intense fear 
and vulnerability? Does it grieve us to think 
about the threatened democracy of a nation 
once, and still, divided?

It may grieve us. But does it grieve us 

enough to hold the one responsible for what 
took place this day accountable? Did it grieve 
Congress enough to impeach Donald Trump 
again? Did it grieve Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., who, despite his acknowledgement 
and condemnation of the former president’s 
incitement of the insurrection, still voted to 
acquit Trump?

We must be grieved by these traumas 

and by a host of others that continue in 
scrolls of unspeakable horrors and still-
silenced stories that have yet to surface. 
And if we do claim to be grieved by our 
wrongdoings, it is difficult to believe that 
those in power, who are able to correct 
or prevent the very pain they inflict, are 
nearly grieved enough. If the darkness of 
our nation did, in fact, grieve us, we would 
never dare to allow the same patterns of 
history to be left unchecked, forgotten and 
repeated again.

This is not to say that a vote in an 

impeachment trial, or the decision of a 
single Supreme Court case, or even the 
rewriting of a history textbook can reverse 

our collective wrongs and unclench the 
hatred that chokes our nation — these 
manifestations would only be attempts 
at undoing injustice after the fact. This is 
not to discount the efforts of those who 
evidently have been grieved by such events 
— who have fought, marched and organized 
tirelessly to create a world in which it is 
love, and not a repairing of grieved hurt, 
that moves us forward.

But as I witness the unfolding of history 

and the precedents that ultimately are 
being set by our collective nation, as I read 
into the past and look into the future, the 
question remains: 

Are we grieved, as a nation? Have we 

ever been?

Perhaps the most dreaded facet of online 

learning is the Zoom Breakout Room, a 
wasteland of black screens and muted 
microphones and often silent, unrequited 
group work in a shared Google Document. 
And like Grant Wood’s “American Gothic,” 
the Zoom Breakout Room has come to 
define itself as a somber event of cultural 
permanence. It’s s the ultimate battleground 
of the virtual college experience and more 
deeply, one of the darkest underbellies of 
social interaction. My experiences in breakout 
rooms have left me questioning my peers’ 
integrity, maturity and emotional depth, but 
more importantly, have led me to a much 
more refined understanding of the human 
condition. You see, our experiences are not 
always novel or paramount: all of our hearts 
begin to race before we enter a breakout room, 
our palms begin to sweat and sometimes we 
stutter and ramble and overshare about our 
love for Jhumpa Lahiri or Audie Cornish from 
All Things Considered or Emily Ratajkowski’s 
essay on buying herself back. With this in 
mind, I have amassed a list of proven tips 
and tricks, through a lengthy process of trial 

and error, on conquering the Zoom Breakout 
Room once and for all. Use at your own 
discretion. 

1. Turn Your Camera On. Taking the 

initiative to turn your camera on in a breakout 
room can often be nerve wracking and 
nauseating especially when no one else has 
theirs on. People tend to mirror one another 
and turning mine on has almost always 
catalyzed a chain reaction of cameras turning 
on. It’s important to be aware that often people 
keep their cameras off because of external 
circumstances we may not understand. For 
this reason turning on cameras can be a hefty 
matter and one that should be approached 
with tact and care. Never force cameras to 
be turned on, this is a process that is best 
undertaken naturally. If you turn your camera 
on and no one follows suit, you should probably 
turn it back off. According to the students in 
my biology discussion breakout room, each 
breakout room has its own delightful bags of 
tricks and surprises and sometimes we get 
handed a smelly bag rotting at the seams. 

2. Ask People How They’re Doing. I start 

every conversation in breakout rooms I’m 
thrusted into by asking people how they are 
doing. This is a common courtesy and should 
always be asked. “How are you doing?” poses 
itself as an even more potent conversation starter 

in the midst of a pandemic. People are not often 
asked this question with sincerity, nor are we 
expected to answer honestly. It’s okay to not be 
doing well. It’s okay to be honest and open about 
failure. It opens the floor to productive dialogue 
and most importantly, renders the breakout 
room a safe virtual space for completing group 
work. Sometimes I don’t know the answer to the 
group work. Sometimes unprecedented events 
happen or we lose motivation or the world can 
become lean and mean for periods of time and 
we fall weeks behind in lectures or readings. 
That is OK. 

3. Ask People About Their Music Taste. 

People love to be understood, validated and 
heard in all kinds of ways. Music and sharing 
music presents itself as one of the most sacred 
forms of friendship and communication. 
People love to talk about music and more 
importantly, the kind of music they listen to, 
because by default it is an extension of the soul 
and the mind and the heart. Sometimes this 
doesn’t work and I’ll receive vague answers 
like I-listen-to everything-but-country but 
sometimes I’ll get things like Phoebe Bridgers 
(who I discovered through a breakout 
room!) and Ms. Lauryn Hill and Mos Def. 

Earlier this month, I was walking down 

South Forest Avenue with a friend of mine on 
a Friday night when two white men drove by 
us on the sidewalk. They rolled down their 
windows and one of them proceeded to shout 
at me to “get off the street” followed by the 
N-word. Two weeks later, I can still vividly recall 
the fear and discomfort I felt in the moment. 
The event, which happened mere blocks away 
from my apartment, turned what used to be a 
familiar street to me into a cruel reminder of the 
antiquated attitudes still existing everywhere 
in the United States, including (and especially) 
here, at the University of Michigan. It reminded 
me that, as African philosophy scholar Mabogo 
P. More once stated, “To live under the threat of 
non-being is to live in what existentialists call 
a condition of finitude, the constant possibility 
of disintegration and death and, therefore, 
anguish and anxiety.” This immense lack of 
control over the way society perceives us, as 
Black beings, has a tremendous impact on our 
lived experience. 

Nowadays, we often talk about racial 

oppression on a systemic level, typically 
from an economic standpoint by examining 
the impacts of structural inequality. But 
not nearly as often do we discuss the effects 
oppression has on the body, mind and soul 
of the oppressed being –– the disparaging 

impact that incessantly being perceived as an 
other, along with the ongoing relativization to 
the white norm, has on the psyche of the dis-
possessed subject. 

Steve Biko, a radical South African activist, 

wrote extensively on what it means to be 
Black in an anti-Black world. Before he was 
assassinated by the South African apartheid 
regime in 1977, he worked heavily with 
the South African Student Organization 
and contributed towards establishing the 
Black Consciousness Movement. This was 
a movement combining ideologies of Black 
Power, philosophical notions of (Black) 
consciousness and radical Christianity in 
order to empower Black people to assert their 
own autonomy and self-determination, thus 
challenging the white power structure. Biko 
believed, and once stated, “The most potent 
weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the 
mind of the oppressed.” I know firsthand 
what it’s like to carry the weight of a lifetime 
of internalized oppression. It’s an ongoing 
process to overcome the never-ending feelings 
of imposter syndrome, coupled with my 
increasingly negative self-esteem and body 
image after years and years of being socialized 
by our anti-Black society to hate myself.

It’s true that a lifetime of racialized 

oppression 
psychologically 
alters 
the 

conscious experience of the oppressed 
individual. According to Frantz Fanon, 
a radical Black political philosopher, this 
constant subjugation to violence results in the 

epidermalization of inferiority in the mind 
of the colonized subject. In other words, 
in attempting to subvert and mitigate the 
likelihood of discrimination, the oppressed 
individual will subconsciously strive to adhere 
to standards of whiteness, thus internalizing 
their oppression “in anticipation of the 
punitive norms.”

Growing up, I felt this internalization daily 

without even being aware of it. Living in a world 
where you’re constantly otherized, conscious of 
your racialized identity in relation to others or, 
as Biko referred to in his “On Death” chapter of 
his popular text “I Write What I Like,” facing 
“a permanent struggle against an omnipresent 
death.” And as much as I try to shake it, by no 
fault of my own, this omnipresence of death is 
always following me, lingering, as a constant 
reminder of my sheer lack of control over how 
I am perceived in this world. 

But even at my lowest, I remind myself that 

I have the capacity to rise above it all. To do so, 
I often find myself drawing parallels between 
the Black Consciousness Movement’s notion 
of salvation and deliverance (by going from 
non-being to being) with the Biblical notions 
of salvation and deliverance found through 
Jesus Christ. As Biko discusses in his text, “The 
Radical Gospel of Black Consciousness,” Black 
consciousness entails a radical transformation 
of the ontological status of the individual, 
going from an inauthentic to authentic being. 
The inauthenticity of repressing one’s own 
self in fear of retaliation from the unjust status 

quo is stripped away by the 
affirmation of one’s own being. 

In a similar vein, liberation 

theologists such as Latin 
American philosopher Ignacio 
Ellacuría, 
draw 
similar 

comparisons of deliverance 
in the act of seeking salvation 
in Jesus Christ. In his text, 
“The 
Crucified 
Peoples,” 

Ellacuría 
discusses 
how 

an overwhelming majority 
of humankind is crucified 
by means of natural, historical and personal 
oppression. He claims that the crucifixion of 
Jesus Christ on the cross serves as a double 
soteriology (salvation doctrine) by tying together 
the passion and death of Christ with the 
oppressed.

This carries with it heavy implications: 

The notion that the Creator of the Universe 
–– all we’ve ever known, experienced or 
sensed –– came down onto Earth in order to 
side with those who have historically been 
persecuted and to affirm the existence of their 
beings is something that gives me solace as I 
navigate a society hell-bent on killing me. As 
Black theologian James Cone wrote in Black 
Theology and Black Power, “In Christ, God 
enters human affairs and takes sides with the 
oppressed. Their suffering becomes His, their 
despair, divine despair.”

This new life that is given through Christ 

parallels this radical transformation from non-

being to being. They both seek for us to live a 
life that is affirmative and liberative of the 
oppressed, by wrestling with death in order to 
receive life. As Luke 4:18 states, “The Spirit of 
the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed 
me to preach the good news to the poor (...) 
To set at liberty those who are oppressed, To 
proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”

I find comfort in this. The knowledge 

that I am not determined by my earthly, 
bodily existence and the demonic nature of 
capitalism and white supremacy omnipresent 
in our world. As Fanon once stated in his 
seminal piece “Black Skin, White Masks,” 
“In the world through which I travel I am 
endlessly creating myself.” With this in mind, I 
continue traveling, paving my own path amid 
the persecution, and whenever I feel hopeless 
over my lack of control in the present, I stop 
and think to myself who really is in control in 
the end –– and that, in all its glory, liberates me.

I think I’m in love with online tests

Valentine’s Day passed and no one bought you a 

bouquet of your favorite flowers or the Baby Yoda 
chocolate-covered strawberries or a valentine-
edition Squishmallow or even a card.

If you’re anything like me, scrolling through 

TikTok and seeing couples go on picnics and being 
all lovey, then you also wonder where your version 
of that love is. It’s been 18 years of me, myself and I.

So when I took a love language test at the 

beginning of quarantine in March, I thought to 
myself, “Why the heck are you taking this? You’ve 
literally never been in love before.” My result: 
quality time. But that’s not what mattered to me. 
While taking the test, I found myself answering 
things I never really thought about. Do I like it more 
when I get a hug or a note from someone I love? Do 
I prefer being close to someone I love or getting a 
compliment from them? 

The more I questioned and learned about the 

way I love, the more fascinated I became with these 
online tests that seemed to know me better than I 
knew myself. I then took the infamous Myers-Briggs 
test with my sister. Our results for this test: ESFP for 
me and INFJ for my sister. We spent the next hour 
and a half reading and reflecting on our results, 
recalling memories together that demonstrated 
certain aspects of our personalities according to the 
test. My sister and I are as close as can be, and even 
then, I found myself revealing to her thoughts and 
feelings I never let out. The test told me things that 
I never let myself think about, because who really 

likes to acknowledge that they have weaknesses and 
flaws? It put into words all the thoughts I had but 
could never put into words myself.

It’s hard to imagine that a test from 1962 could 

describe 2020 me with such accuracy. And I know 
people who don’t trust these tests because they think 
that it only tells you about yourself if you’re honest 
with your responses, and some people choose their 
answers based on what they want the outcome to be. 
Despite this, I don’t really mind because these tests 
set me on a road towards learning and loving myself, 
as cheesy or cliché as that may sound. 

From the start of April on, my growing interest in 

learning how to really love myself as a result of taking 
these tests led me to ideas like the Law of Attraction, 
manifestation and the Butterfly Effect — all that 
good universe stuff. I started journaling more about 
my thoughts, my feelings and my flaws, and soon 
enough my mindset was changing. I was no longer 
focusing on why I didn’t have a boyfriend but rather 
on why I was so adamant that I needed someone else 
to make myself happy. 

This change in mindset is why I believe these 

online tests are more than tests. In a Facebook 
Messenger group for my Vietnamese Student 
Association family, my grandbig sends us these tests 
to take. Together, we fill out an excel sheet with our 
results, helping us discover the more personal details 
within each other’s characters. In a boba shop, my 
Japan Student Association family and I take the test 
together to see how we each respond; they create 
ease and a bond.

Indigo Sparke has a way of 

gathering the stars and keeping them 
in her pocket, handing them out on 
her guitar strings as she sees fit. The 
Australian singer-songwriter’s debut 
album, Echo, surrounds you, yet never 
leaves you feeling claustrophobic. It is 
as wide open as the deserts she drew 
inspiration from in the making of this 
album.

This openness is reflected in 

the way the album seeks the right 
questions, rather than the correct 
answers. The songs often embark 
on mini philosophical quests, each 
anchored 
by 
Sparke’s 
languid, 

melancholy tones and simple guitar 
backings. Her sound evokes the 
centering gravity of Bedouine, or 
perhaps Angel Olsen at her most 
simple and haunting. Although the 
album is mostly Sparke and her guitar, 
with the barest touches of piano, 
percussion and bass here and there, 
these all come together to make a sum 
that is greater than its parts.

In “Colourblind,” the guitar and 

tambourine slowly gather their things 
and enter the album. There is a patience 
to her voice, the pace at which she 
moves through the piece. How do those 
we surround ourselves with affect the 
way we see the world? This becomes 
the first of the many self-reflective 
inquiries the album inspires. Sparke 
continues to question and explore in 
tracks like “Everything, Everything” 
and “Baby.” The lyrics in “Everything 
Everything” surrounding death make 
it a fitting closer to the album. Her 
whispered tones enhance the song’s 
mystery and magic. As she affirms 
that “Everything, everything is dying” 
and “Everything is simple,” there is 
no dread involved. It doesn’t even feel 
like a resolute stamp marked “END.” 
It asks of the listener what it means to 

die and what it means to live. There is a 
peaceful transformation of something 
often viewed as a spectre of fear 
and suffering into a straightforward 
communal experience. 

“Baby” is the lead single off of the 

album, in which Sparke submerges 
you in a lake of melancholy and pulls 
you out by the grace of her love. Echo 
evokes strong visuals; in this one, 
Sparke is surrounded by glowing 
balls of light, as she sings of “energy 
balls all around us” in an exploration 
of universal energy fields. Through 
the music, she asks us and herself: 
What brings someone comfort? What 
pushes someone? Can it ever be the 
same thing?

Comfort and unease coexist in a 

strange balancing act on this record. 
In tracks like “Golden Age,” it is 
difficult to say if the warm grain of 
the guitar pulls you to a more familiar, 
tangible reality, or if its swooping 
chords shoot you off into space again. 
Even while singing of old, long-
term loves, there is always a feeling 
of everything changing, of new 
things arising; your skin gives way to 
goosebumps.

Sparke’s struggles with her own 

eroticism are delicately approached. 
“The witch of desire” greets her in 
“Undone,” while in “Carnival” she 
asks “Will you be mine?”, struggling 
to connect with something so she 
doesn’t lose herself. 

With “Wolf” comes Sparke’s 

deepest approach to her sexuality. 
As her female lover beckons her, 
“Come upstairs, let me show you all 
the parts you haven’t seen / There’s 
a hell, there’s a heaven, there’s a 
universe exploding,” the impact of 
these experiences is hard to deny. Her 
grand lyrics and ghostly vocals make 
you pause every so often to catch up to 
what you are feeling. 

The funny thing about love is 

no matter who you are, how many 
relationships you’ve had or how close 
you are to your family, there’s always 
more you can learn. Love is a never-
ending lesson. In this spirit I write 
to you, as a 19-year-old girl who has 
watched a lot of television, to share what 
I’ve learned — amateur to amateur. 
While, in my opinion, love languages 
don’t fully capture the boundlessness 
of what intimacy with another person 
can mean, I do think they’re a good 
place to start the conversation. They’ve 
certainly expanded how I interpret the 
different ways that caring for someone 
can manifest, so I thought I’d go 
language by language, show by show, 
to describe how my ideas about love 
have grown over the years.

Physical 
Touch 
— 
“The 

Handmaid’s Tale”

Physical touch has always easily 

fit into my understanding of love, as 
there often aren’t words to describe the 
feeling of wanting to comfort someone 
or show them you’re there for them. 
Yet what I didn’t understand until I 
watched “The Handmaid’s Tale” was 
the extent to which physical touch can 
palpably define the way our lives feel.

“The Handmaid’s Tale,” based on 

Margaret Atwood’s novel, is the story 
of a fundamentalist Christian society 
dictated by strict rules — particularly 
for women — and the notion that 
someone is always watching you, 
should you slip up. Handmaids are 
under constant surveillance and in 
an environment that seems to be the 
furthest thing from love. Bearing 
children 
is 
methodically 
done, 

and any sort of love or kindness is 
something that sneaks through the 
system, not caused by it. Interestingly, 
it was precisely the way the system 
stripped away the protagonist June’s 
ability to be close to others — and be 
touched outside of a sexual context 
— that made me realize how physical 
closeness fosters emotional intimacy 
even outside of a relationship. The 
lack of physical touch heightens 
June’s isolation, and I couldn’t help 
but feel touch-starved with her. 
Without physical connection, life 
seems robotic, cold and dreary. After 
watching the show, I felt newfound 
gratitude for the ability to hold 
people close and how it can serve as a 
reminder that you are not alone. 

Words of Affirmation — “Sense8”
I’ve seen “Sense8” multiple times 

since I first watched it when I was 15. 
With every watch, I’ve noticed new 
lines in the show where characters 

have said the right words when other 
characters needed them, and it made 
all the difference. 

In “Sense8,” humans known as 

“sensates” are psychically linked with 
seven other individuals spread across 
the world. Sensates are able to take 
in the senses of the other people they 
are connected to and communicate 
with them, even appearing to be 
in the same room as their fellow 
sensates. Over time, the main group of 
sensates in the show grows closer and 
closer, understanding each other’s 
personalities, feelings and stories at 
the deepest level. I think it’s because of 
the deep bonds the show establishes 
that it is able to depict words of 
affirmation that hit profoundly. 

I mean, in what other show can you 

get quotes like “The real violence, the 
violence I realized was unforgivable, 
is the violence that we do to ourselves, 
when we’re too afraid to be who we 
really are,” and “your life is either 
defined by the system or how you defy 
the system,” as advice?

Quality Time — “Avatar: The 

Last Airbender”

“Avatar: The Last Airbender” was 

a phenomenal show for a multitude 
of reasons, but while the show’s 
compelling 
character 
arcs 
may 

include many important lessons about 
love, I realized that I couldn’t help 

but feel the love present in even the 
most filler of episodes in the series. 
I loved all the episodes of “Avatar” 
in which the gang simply stops at a 
village or town on their journey and 
spends time together, learning how 
to do what’s right. “Avatar” was a 
great series because of the chemistry 
between the characters, which comes 
through even in the more dramatic 
episodes. I learned that, when it comes 
to love, the smallest moments can feel 
the most meaningful.

Acts of Service — “Gilmore Girls”
When I think of characters that 

remind me of acts of service, Luke 
from “Gilmore Girls” is the first 
person who comes to mind. Luke 
wasn’t one for expressing his feelings 
in words, sometimes to a fault, but 
there’s no one I can think of who 
has more consistently shown up for 
the people in his life by offering care 
through his time and skills. Luke 
loves cooking, fixing things and 
making sure Rory and Lorelai are fed 
and safe. Yes, Luke’s a good partner 
to Lorelai and good father figure to 
Rory, but he’s also the sort of guy I’d 
love to have as a neighbor. Despite 
his grouchiness, we all know he 
cares. I may not be as handy as Luke, 
but I still channel my inner Luke 
when I refill the Brita pitcher for my 
roommates, or bake cake pops for 

my friends when they’re stressed or 
even just check in with them to see if 
there are ways I can help, rather than 
simply telling them I’m thinking 
about them.

Receiving Gifts — “New Girl”
Ah, gifts. The forgotten love 

language. To be quite honest, I still 
feel a little hesitation whenever I 
hear that someone’s primary love 
language is gifts, but at the same time 
I’ve realized it also doesn’t get enough 
hype. There’s no moment in television 
that has shown me the power of giving 
gifts more than Season 3, Episode 13 of 
“New Girl” in which Nick, a character 

who can only be described as a hot 
mess, puts together an extremely 
thoughtful gift for Jess, who has 
always wanted a great birthday. I don’t 
know why, but watching someone 
who never has it together spend a lot 
of time to show how much he cares 
makes me feel incredibly soft. I’ll just 
say Jess was not the only one crying 
by the end of the episode. The episode 
taught me that amid the hustle and 
bustle of life, even when everything 
seems like a mess, just taking a little bit 
of time to show someone you’ve been 
thinking about them can remind our 
loved ones that we care.

Minari has a lot of names. I’m not 

talking about the film, but its namesake, 
Oenanthe javanica. For the uninitiated, 
it’s an herb used in a variety of cuisines, 
prepared by itself or added to elevate 
an existing dish. In Korea it’s called 
minari; in Japan, it’s called seri. Here 
we call it Japanese parsley, or Chinese 
celery, or Indian pennywort, or Java 
water dropwort or just plain water 
celery sans any national distinction. 
As one character remarks, “It grows 
anywhere, like weeds … rich or poor, 
anyone can enjoy it and be healthy.” So, 
it’s got a lot of names.

This weed of 10,000 names and 

10,000 homes neatly sets up the 
enduring metaphor of “Minari.” The 
film is Americana in celluloid but also 
a prototypical immigrant tale, for isn’t 
America supposed to be the monarch 
of immigrant tales, in lip service if not 
in unvarnished truth? The movie’s 
also one of those classic fish-out-of-
water, family-seen-through-the-eyes-
of-a-child stories that are practically a 
genre of their own. “Minari” fits in as 

a faithful example that will no doubt 
resonate with many an immigrant or 
displaced person. But none of that is 
to say “Minari” is a formulaic stock 
film — it’s imbued with an incredible, 
enchanting specificity that can only be 
spun off the vagaries and vicissitudes 
of lived experience. 

Shaped by writer-director Lee 

Isaac Chung’s (“I Have Seen My Last 
Born”) early childhood, it follows 
a Korean husband-wife duo and 
their Korean American children as 
they try to navigate the turns and 
bends of agrarian life in rural 1980s 
Arkansas. The child observer is young 
David Yi (Alan Kim, in his debut), 
a sweet, chubby-faced kid with a 
heart condition. David is, of course, a 
fictionalized, de-aged Chung. David 
spends his days trouncing around 
the Arkansan backcountry with his 
sister Anne (Noel Cho, in her debut), 
a dutiful older sibling that weathers 
microaggressions like a champ and 
his grandmother Soonja — a crass 
crone with a jovial nature played with 
incredible charm by Yuh-Jung Youn 
(“The Bacchus Lady”).

If David is the beating, slightly 

arrhythmic heart of the film, it’s 

his parents and the assimilation 
anxieties they represent that provide 
the catalyzing force and anima of 
the film. Steve Yeun (“Burning”) 
and Han Ye-ri (“Champion”) give 
quiet yet full-bodied, heart-grasping 
performances as Jacob and Monica. 
They’re professional chicken sexers, 
an oh-so-unglamorous line of work 
involving adorable little chickens that 
you condemn to either be tossed in a 
furnace or raised, fattened, squeezed of 
all their eggs and eventually McNugget-
ified (depending on the parts between 
their legs). Monica is a city-bred 
woman who misses Korea with ardor, 
but whose only focus is bringing in the 
dough to support her children. Jacob, 
on the other hand, has big, American 
dream-inflected ambitions that extend 
beyond being an arbiter of the fate of 
poultry. After arriving in their new 
pastoral, podunk life in Arkansas, he 
explains to Monica that it’s the soil that 
brought them there: “The best dirt in 
America,” he excitedly claims. Jacob 
sees the opportunity to feed thousands 
of Koreans with a little taste of home. 
Monica sees dirt.

Dirt is something of a focus in 

“Minari.” The film carefully considers 

the natural beauty of the land: rolling 
fields, babbling brooks, winding roads 
hemmed in by trees and trees and 
trees. The idyllic scenes are contrasted 
by family tensions and the looming 
specter of financial catastrophe, both 
aspects accompanied bewitchingly by 
the film’s light, languid soundtrack.

But Monica’s not wrong, either. Dirt 

is dirt, and people seldom imagine 
their future in dirt, whether or not a 
few pretty things grow out of it. It’s a 
lonely, uncertain life for immigrant 
Koreans in the homogenous alabaster 
expanse of rural Arkansas. Culture 
shock runs rampant and goes both 
ways: Just as kids make fun of Anne 
and David’s language and faces, the 
Yis are endlessly put off by the locals’ 
Bible-thumping and reliance on things 
like dowsing wands — “Koreans use 
their minds,” Jacob reminds his son. 

This mélange of identities and the 

category crises that ensue are the 
film’s quarry. What does it mean to 
be Korean when you’re no longer 
in Korea? What does it mean to be 
American when you’re not from 
America? Can Grandma smell like 
Korea, even if you yourself have 
never smelled Korea? (That last one 

is courtesy of David.) It approaches 
these topics with a tender and earnest 
touch, never failing to inspire a laugh, 
a tear or poignant pause with each 
carefully framed slice-of-life moment.

“Minari” the film experienced 

a bit of a category crisis as well. Is it 
“Minari” the American movie, or 
“Minari” the Korean movie? At the 
Sundance Film Festival, it snagged 
both the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury 
Prize and the U.S. Dramatic Audience 
Award, a rare confluence of accolades. 

But, at the Golden Globes, it was 

relegated to the Foreign Language 
Film category. It won the top prize 
among foreign language films but 
was disallowed from competing in 

the Best Drama category due to its 
Korean-bent language. It’s true, the 
film is mostly in Korean, so subtitles 
are a must for the non-fluent. But let’s 
be clear: It’s all a load of malarkey. The 
original question was not meant to be 
profound, for it was no question at all. 
“Minari” is as American as apple pie, 
not in spite but because of its Korean 
furnishings. 

But these categories, as crisis-

inducing as they can be, are 
ephemeral. Like all the great fish-out-
of-water family stories, it’s less about 
being a fish-out-of-water and more 
about being a family. Korea, Arkansas 
— dirt is dirt, and a family can grow 
anywhere.

‘Minari’ serves up a soul-touching slice of Americana

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

Be careful with privacy issues this 
week, Aries. What you think is yours 
to share may well not be. This is 
particularly true if you think you are 
helping a friend or a colleague – be 

very careful not to jump 
the gun.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

Mars’ arrival in your sign is big news 
this week and you’ll be feeling 
energized, optimistic, ambitious and 
capable. This translates into 
increased vigor in all areas of your 
life, but perhaps especially in your 

personal life.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

Something is hidden from you, 
Cancer, and you can’t stand that. The 
urge to dig deep and to ferret out the 
truth is exceptionally strong this 
week, not least because Mars begins 

to transit your secrecy zone.

TAURUS

With Mars arriving in your money zone 
this week, Taurus, you may feel driven 
to increase your income in whatever 
way is currently possible. Obviously, 
this is a helpful and very motivating 

influence in some ways, 
but you may also start to 
feel very materialistic.

VIRGO

PISCES

LIBRA
LEO

The arrival of Mars in your 
humanitarian zone brings out the 
best in your zodiac sign's 
warm-hearted nature, Leo. You’ll feel 
driven to help others, whether that’s 

in a practical sense, or 
through donating money, 
or through raising 
awareness.

Ready to shine, Virgo? Mars arrives in 
your career zone this week, pushing 
you into the spotlight and 
demanding that you showcase your 
talents. It’s a brilliant week for job 

seeking, interviews, 

promotions and long 
overdue recognition for 
your hard work.

Studying is highlighted this week, and 
with Mars arriving in your higher 
education zone, it’s a brilliant time to 
start a new course or start working 
towards a qualification.

Mars’ arrival in your passion zone sets 
the tone for the week – you can expect 
a lot of memorable moments in a 
relationship, but there is also intense 
jealousy here, and even anger. Check 

your motives very carefully 

and be scrupulously 

honorable in your actions 
towards your partner.

Mars, the planet of passion, arrives in 
your zodiac sign's love zone this week 
– that has to be good news, right? 
And it is, especially for a tired or 
flagging relationship, where Mars can 

help you rediscover why 

you fell in love.

Mars arrives in your vitality zone, 
Capricorn, making this an incredible 
week to set new health and fitness 
goals. You’ll be motivated and full of 
positivity, which you can use to set up 

a new regime or lifestyle.

Are you ready to party, Aquarius? Mars 
arrives in your joy zone, urging you to 
do more – much more – of whatever 
makes you happy this week. From 
creative hobbies, dance, art and music 
to more time spent with your loved 

ones, it’s all about whatever 
makes you smile.

A family impasse could finally be 
resolved this week as Mars shifts into 
your family zone. This energy enables 
you to take the lead and to force 
matters to a conclusion, but not 
necessarily quietly – there is anger 

here, and frustration too.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about 
the big bang.”

“Do you ever wonder why are 
we alive?”

fresh air!”

 Editor’s Note: This transcript has been edited and 
condensed for clarity. Remember sitting next 
to a friend in the library and sharing earbuds 
to introduce them to a new song? Or hearing 
something unfamiliar at a party and immediately 
looking up the lyrics to save it to your phone? 
Since the days of easily experiencing music with 
others are gone (for now), the music beat decided 
to make up for some lost opportunities by holding 
a virtual listening party last week. Writers were 
asked to bring a love song to share with the 
group over Zoom and then chat about what they 
thought. Here’s what happened. 

***

Katie Beekman, Senior Arts Editor: Who 

wants to go first and introduce their song? 

Madeleine 
Virginia 
Gannon, 
Daily 

Arts Writer: My song is “I’ve Heard that 
Song Before.” It’s an old sort of ’20s jazz song 
performed by Harry James, who was a swing 
trumpeter, but it has vocals with it and the 
reason I like it is even though it’s not inherently 
romantic in the sense that it’s talking about 
heartbreak or talking about falling in love, it has 
this sort of deep, familiar, comforting nostalgia. 
You’ll hear in the song that the main lyrics are: 
“I’ve heard that song before,” and I thought, as 
music writers, that would evoke a warm feeling 
because we all know that sense of listening to an 
album or a song and thinking, “We know that, 
that’s familiar.” I think there is a certain sense 
of romance to recognizing a song and a familiar 
tune, and it certainly has a very romantic vibe, 
I think, from the old-style instrumentation in 
jazz. 

Kaitlyn Fox, Music Beat Editor: It’s 

refreshing to hear older music from when 
people would have a variety of real instruments. 
Nowadays, some artists can’t afford to bring in 
anything outside of what their band members 
can play. I was thinking about that when I was 
hearing the song, and it was nice.

Gannon: Also, I swing dance, and this is the 

sort of song that you would swing dance to, so it 
also has that human companionship element. 
Someone who knows how to dance to this style 
of music will know exactly what steps to do — it 
evokes a very romantic memory.

Drew Gadbois, Daily Arts Writer: With 

songs like that, the recording equipment is older 
and there’s this little hazy pop to it. It is kind of 
hypnotic and it creates this almost wistful sort of 
atmosphere that is really inviting.

Gadbois: I can probably go next. When I was 

thinking about different ideas of what love is 
and what love could be I was thinking of this 
very whimsical, kind of childlike quality that’s 
fully joyful. So I kept coming back to this song, 
“Summertime Clothes” by Animal Collective. 
There’s almost a lost in time sort of aspect to being 
in love with someone or just having a moment 
with someone and I think this song expresses it 
really well. 

Gadbois: I’m not going to lie, I hadn’t seen the 

music video up until this point and it was a lot 
more horrifying than I thought it would be, but 
I also think it shows that there’s a point at which 
you can love someone so much it’s crazy. You feel 
like you’re going insane. I think that the lyrics 
express that just absolute heightened state. 

Beekman: I really liked that. I think the lyrics 

that stuck out to me were, “I want to walk around 
with you” and then at the end it continues, “with 
you, with you, with you, with you.” It sounds so 
simple, but especially with all the other stuff 
going on in the song instrumentation-wise, 
it stands out. I think those lyrics are a really 
good encapsulation of being so enamored with 
someone you just want to take a walk with them.

Gadbois: Yeah and there’s another line about 

just frolicking in a fountain and that’s all they’re 
doing, but you hear it and it sounds like someone 
kind of running around in water. 

Gannon: I really liked the song. The whole 

time I had the most vivid imagery of an indie 
coming-of-age movie set in the summertime. 
It’s like a first love, but you’re about to 
move on with your life so you 
don’t know what to do with 
it. And like Katie said, 
“I just want to walk 
around with you.” 
I think it’s a really 
well-chosen 
song 

for such a specific 
feeling of growing 
up. 

Fox: That’s not a 

genre I would have 
thought 
of 
when 

picking a love song, 
but it totally makes 
sense. 
I 
really 

appreciated 
that 

the lyrics are pretty 
simple, but the music is 
so intense, so it’s a weird 
contrast. 

Gadbois: There’s a physicality, I think, that 

ties together a lot of Animal Collective’s work. 
There’s a simplicity to what they’re talking about, 
but a lot of it gets fleshed out through what you’re 
hearing. It’s funny, you mention coming-of-age 
too because this song came out in 2009. So it did 
come out at that age when you start to discover 
music like that and it feels so fitting. 

Nora Lewis, Daily Arts Writer: So I chose 

“Do You Remember” by Jill Scott because when I 
think of love songs, I gravitate toward ’90s R&B. I 
like the narrative style of a lot of ’90s R&B and this 
song, in particular, is a reflection of a childhood 
love and how it’s grown over the years, which I 
think is really sweet. 

Beekman: Another great choice. To me, that 

felt like a sunny afternoon drive home on the 
school bus. 

Gadbois: It’s interesting you say it’s sunny, 

because I felt the exact opposite. I was thinking 
about a moonlit walk under street lights. I think 
’90s R&B production has some of the most 

mysterious and alluring sounds. It’s insane 
because it immediately sucks you in and you have 
to sway your head. It’s so good.

Gannon: I feel like I lost time listening to that 

song because I was so hypnotized. It completely 
took over every one of my senses. I was suspended 
while I was listening to it and then when it ended 
it let me go. I was out of it for the whole time, in a 
good way. It was comforting and warm — I felt 
enveloped by the music.

Lewis: I feel like it’s a good mixture of what 

Katie and Drew said. I think it’s supposed to 
be a reflection on a childhood love, so Scott 
reflects on the past, which is the sunny, 
childhood part, and she sings about where 
they are now, like they are catching up on a 
nighttime stroll. 

Gadbois: Regardless, it’s definitely a warm 

feeling. I think you’re totally right and I don’t 
think of a nighttime stroll as anything other than 
warm as well. 

Beekman: To finish the party, I chose a 

country song: “Just to See You Smile” by Tim 

McGraw.

Gadbois: There’s an awesome 
rhythm to that that I really 

enjoyed.

Gannon: I thoroughly 
enjoyed that. There’s 
something 
about 

country music and 
the instrumentation 
of the fiddle and 
banjo 
and 
the 

vulnerable 
vocals 

that make it feel very 

“every man.” It feels 
more relatable than the 
average song just because 

it feels so pared down 

musically. It feels as if someone 

is just sitting there on their porch, 

singing about seeing you smile. I thought it 

was a really great romantic song, probably one of 
the most vulnerable and emotionally accessible 
of the songs we listened to. Mine was very old-
fashioned and Drew’s song evoked an intense 
emotional nostalgia. But I feel like the Tim 
McGraw song is one that anyone of any musical 
taste could relate to. 

Lewis: I’m not really like a country fan 

generally, but I feel like the word to describe the 
song is jovial. It’s very upbeat and fun and it works 
well as a love song. Like Madeleine said, anyone 
can kind of relate to it, which is nice. 

Beekman: Does anyone have anything to say 

about our choices overall? 

Gadbois: I think they reflect the music beat 

entirely. 

Gannon: I think the songs make a lot of sense. 

Love is different for everyone, it’s not just one 
thing. There’s a lot of different ways to love and 
a lot of different kinds of love so I think it makes 
sense that none of our songs are very similar.

Beekman: Well, thanks for coming to the 

party, y’all. I hope you had a good time.

8 — Wednesday, March 3, 2021 

It’s no secret that FOX has been, 

for better or worse, one of the most 
influential producers of animated 
television. From “The Simpsons” to 
“American Dad!” to “Family Guy,” the 
studio has been carving the landscape 
of adult animation for generations. But 
as a proud member of Gen Z, none of 
these programs have resonated with 
me nearly as much as the relatively 
recent “Bob’s Burgers.” Its style of 
character-driven 
humor, 
which 

combines weirdness with heartfelt 

sincerity, has resulted in one of the 
most beloved TV families of the past 
decade. 

Now, “Bob’s Burgers” writers and 

executive producers Wendy and 
Lizzie Molyneux have teamed up 
with Minty Lewis (“Close Enough”) 
to produce “The Great North,” a show 
with all the winning ingredients of its 
predecessor.

“Parks and Recreation” star Nick 

Offerman plays Beef Tobin (yes, his 
name is Beef): a single father of four 
(along with a soon-to-be daughter-
in-law). Among these children is 
Judy (Jenny Slate, “Big Mouth”), a 
fantastically-cast, artistic teenager 

who seeks to experience life outside of 
the frozen forests. 

Along with the same niche humor 

and family focus, the new series also 
features the same animation style 
as “Bob’s Burgers.” It’s simple and 
goofy, and it embraces the colorful 
landscapes and starry skies of the 
“Great North.” Finding beauty within 
simple animation is something these 
shows excel at. 

After the sporadic release dates 

of the last two episodes, the latest 
marks the start of a regular schedule. 
This one follows Wolf Tobin (Will 
Forte, “Scoob!”) as he travels across 
the sea to find avocados for his 

fiancée Honeybee (Dulcé Sloan, “The 
Daily Show with Trevor Noah”), all 
because she had a few dreams about 
guacamole. Meanwhile, Beef and 
Ham (Paul Rust, “Love”) try throwing 
a Shrek-themed party based on Ham’s 
memory of Shrek being gray and a big 
fan of beaches. 

The plotlines are so strange, yet 

they are completely grounded by 
the characters’ innocence and love 
for each other. The best part about 
any good family, blood-related or 
otherwise, is the acceptance and even 
nourishment found in its weirdest 
quirks. In fact, one could argue that 
the thesis of this show, as well as its 

predecessor, might be that this is the 
only thing that makes a good family, as 
the members possess few other traits 
that are traditionally admirable. 

Even Beef, the father and leader 

of the pack, tells his kids that their 
mother was mauled to death by a bear 
so that he doesn’t have to face the fact 
that she left him. The writers give 
sympathy to everyone. We all have 
issues that we need to work out, and 
rarely do we manage them in ways 
that make us look sane.

It’s also worth mentioning how 

great it is to have a comedy about a 
rural Alaskan family that isn’t just 
a bunch of stereotypical rednecks. 

There’s an increasingly problematic 
notion within progressive circles that 
people in red states are all bad, and 
this show serves to challenge that 
idea, especially in its admiration for 
the outdoors.

“The Great North” finds maturity 

and humanity within the awkward 
and the ridiculous. There’s a heart to 
these characters that you don’t often 
find in adult comedy shows. “The 
Great North” is nothing we haven’t 
seen before from the Molyneux 
sisters, but that’s not a bad thing. 
The Tobin family is fresh, lovable 
and loads of fun. I can’t wait to get to 
know them.

“Supernova” 
opens 
in 
total 

darkness. Slowly, stars emerge. One 
shines brightly, then disappears.

Tusker, Stanley Tucci’s character 

(“Spotlight”), later explains that 
everything is made from dying stars, 
which turn into supernovas that spew 
“star stuff,” the building blocks for life, 
through space. With a gigantic flash, 
these interstellar explosions create 
the universe as we know it.

There is a vitality to destruction. A 

beauty, even. 

That’s why “Supernova” is a 

beautiful film. Its subject matter, 
Tusker’s worsening dementia and 
its effects on his partner Sam (Colin 
Firth, “The King’s Speech”) are 
upsetting, even gruesome at times.

The 
relationship 
between 

Tusker and Sam, who are first 
shown nude and in bed together, 
is unflinchingly real. Their love’s 
complete believability makes the 
film heartbreaking when dementia 
escalates its attack. The couple has 
decided to take one last vacation 

through the English countryside, 
staying in an RV with their dog 
Ruby. They drive through locations 
important to their relationship, like 
a quiet lake where they spent their 
first night together, under the stars. 
Speaking of stars, the illness works 
like a supernova in reverse, flashing 
through lives that have already been 
lived, eating them away and leaving 
emptiness in its wake. Maybe it’s more 
of a black hole.

The film is a day-to-day portrait 

of Tusker and Sam’s relationship, 
showing both what makes the men 
perfect for one another — nights spent 
stargazing and days bickering like an 
old married couple, as their van sails 
through verdant English hills — and 
the horror of the imminent illness, 
the far-off look in Tusker’s eyes as the 
fog of memory continues its inevitable 
descent. 

Tucci exhibits a deep sadness in 

every scene, sometimes understated, 
sometimes blazingly tragic, that 
shows the viewer the heartbreaking 
reality of losing oneself as the days go 
by. Firth will also leave most viewers 
reaching for the tissue box. Sam is 
mourning his lover while the man is 

still alive, simultaneously bottling the 
terrible despair so he doesn’t make 
Tusker feel even worse.

“Supernova” is patient, portraying 

the gradual tragedy that accumulates 
because of this dreadful disease. 
The film’s slow pace doesn’t make its 
conclusion less tragic, though, only 
more brutally real.

What makes the film unique is that, 

while the couple depicted are in a gay 
relationship, there is no discussion 
of persecution or even gay identity 
in general. “Supernova” could be 
about any couple. This itself is sort of 
radical. Most gay-centered dramas 
focus on prejudice, a “coming out” 
story or some combination of the two. 
The question, though, is this: Should 
homosexuality be performed by 
heterosexual actors? 

Speaking from my subjective gay 

experience, I think the era where 
this is unquestionably fine has 
passed. Ten years ago, when most 
producers wouldn’t touch a mass-
market gay-themed movie like “Love, 
Simon,” I would have said that queer 
representation was so necessary that, 
if it took heterosexual actors to get the 
story told, then fine.

Yet, in 2021, queer representation 

has become mainstream. Stories 
as diverse as “Ammonite” to 
Pixar’s “Onward” are including 
LGBTQ+ characters and telling all 
sorts of stories. This flourishing 
in the topic hasn’t come with a 
proportionate rise in LGBTQ+ 
performers, however. The queer 
leading characters in “Ammonite,” 
for example, were played by 

heterosexual actresses. Maybe this 
just takes time.

Still, gay identity isn’t a costume 

that can be slipped on. Even if 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Amy 

Coney Barret says so, it’s not a 
“preference.” It’s an identity, a 
community.

It is vital to include LGBTQ+ voices 

behind and in front of the camera, 
especially when the films themselves 

are 
about 
LGBTQ+ 
characters. 

While Firth and Tucci are great, 
there are also plenty of gay actors, 
like Ian McKellen (“The Hobbit: 
an Unexpected Journey”) and B.D. 
Wong (“Nora From Queens”), who 
have lived as gay men in the 20th 
century, experiencing traumas like 
Section 28 and the AIDS crisis, and 
have grown old and loved and lost. 
This was their story to tell.

The music beat has a party

‘The Great North’ is weird, lovable and very Alaskan

Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci 
are stellar in ‘Supernova.’ But...

Taylor Swift released her self-

titled debut album in 2006 at 
only 16 years old. In a way that 
no one could have predicted, 
Swift emerged as the ruler of the 
pop and country music charts 
for the next fifteen years, all 
the way up to her most recent 
release, evermore, in December 
2020. In the past two years or 
so, especially since the release 
of Lover in 2019, I have been 
finding myself wondering how I 
have been able to so consistently 
enjoy Swift’s music, as far back 
as “Should’ve Said No” and as 
recent as “willow.” What is it 
about her or her music that 
makes her stand out so vividly 
from all her contemporaries?

Swift knows how to keep 

people interested, not only in 
the music she’s releasing but 
also in her personal life. From 
her earliest albums, speculation 
about who she writes her songs 
about 
(e.g., 
“All 
Too 
Well” 

and 
the 
now-infamous 
Jake 

Gyllenhaal scarf) has circulated 
around each album. The world, 
regardless of whether they hate 
or love her, knows about her and 
who she surrounds herself with. 

From 
new 
boyfriends 
and 

heartbreak to best friends and 
betrayals, Swift’s life has been 
aggressively public for as long 
as she’s been a part of the music 
industry. Many would argue 
that her public relationships 
and feuds are what keeps her 
so relevant. As Kanye West so 
famously stated, “I made that 
bitch famous.” But I disagree. 
Strongly. So many prominent 
musicians 
have 
maintained 

relevance due to their publicity 
stunts, but so many of those 
artists don’t continue to get 
bigger. With every album Swift 
releases, her fanbase and critical 
acclaim grow.

I’ve realized that Taylor Swift 

is the perfect example of an artist 
who changes with her audience. 
I’m now 19, but when “Love 
Story” came out, eight-year-
old me couldn’t have been more 
obsessed. And while I still listen 
back to tracks like “Love Story” 

and “You Belong With Me,” even 
11 years later those songs are 
filled with nostalgia. Swift not 
only matures with every release, 
but she changes her entire image. 

Taylor Swift was her country 

girl debut release, clean and 
fun. Fearless was a slightly 
matured version of that, and 
Speak Now was her ballad-
filled heartbreaker, where Swift 
became the music industry’s 
princess. Red was her subtle 
transition 
into 
pop 
music, 

marked by the iconic red lipstick. 
1989, in my opinion, redefined 
pop as Swift fully pulled away 
from her country roots. I also 
believe 
that 
Reputation 
was 

the most important comeback 
in 
21st-century 
music, 
and 

she fully committed to the 
bad-girl persona. Lover was a 
complete 180, in which Swift 
became a pastel martyr for true 
love (minus her usual side of 
heartbreak), and sister albums 
folklore and evermore showed 
the most raw, artsy and matured 
version that anyone had ever 
seen from her. 

While not every era of Swift 

has been widely loved by fans, 
they were at least all appreciated. 
Her constant changes, not only in 
the sound of her music but also 
in her public image as it relates 
to each era, are what has allowed 
her to continue flourishing well 
past what would be most artists’ 
prime. 

Something about Taylor Swift 

has stuck with me for years. 
From the 8-year-old who loved 
her early singles to the 19-year-
old me sitting here now writing 
this article, she has maintained 
a place in my mind and heart 
that no other artist has ever 
done. I find myself constantly 
floored by the intricacy of her 
lyrics combined with the ever-
changing sound of her music. She 
has made a song for every single 
tough or beautiful moment in 
my life, whether it be my first 
heartbreak, growing up, moving 
out or being in love. When people 
say Taylor Swift is their mother, 
it’s not an exaggeration. We’ve 
grown up with her and she 
continues to nurture us through 
music in ways I didn’t think were 
possible. 

Taylor Swift’s evolution is 
what makes her timeless

n December 2020, the COVID-19 
vaccine was first administered in 
the United States and people finally 

began to feel a sense of hope. Now that it 
is being provided more widely, people are 
beginning to wonder if a national COVID-
19 vaccine mandate is in store. If this were 
to become a reality, though, the majority of 
states may allow for religious exemptions 
from the vaccine, potentially threatening 
the widespread immunization necessary to 
put an end to this pandemic thus keeping 
many people at risk. In the case of a national 
COVID-19 
vaccine 
mandate, 
religious 

exemptions must not be tolerated, as the 
vast majority have no basis in scripture, and 
the health of the country must be prioritized 
above the unjustified beliefs of a few.

As evidenced by a 2013 study, most major 

world religions have no explicit scripture or 
laws implying any opposition to vaccinations, 
the major religions being Christianity, 
Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and 
Jainism. These religions along with atheism, 
agnosticism and a lack of religious affiliation, 

cover nearly 99% of the U.S. population, 
so it makes little sense that any religious 
exemptions to vaccines could be sustained 
when the health of the country is at stake. 
Furthermore, both the Catholic Church and 
world Islamic leaders have openly endorsed 
the administration of vaccines, noting the 
health of many is a higher priority than the 
beliefs of few. But, in a perceived disagreement 
between religion and scientific teachings, the 
distribution of support is concerning. About 
55% of those with religious affiliations would 
agree with their religious teachings over 
science — only 29% would agree with science 
instead. The fact that so many are willing to 
hold their beliefs above scientific evidence is, 
frankly, pretty scary.

If objections to vaccines on religious 

grounds are not generally rooted in 
religious scripture or promoted by 
leaders, where do they come from? Most 
are largely related to either the ethical 
dilemma of receiving vaccines made from 
human cell tissue or the belief that the 
body is sacred, should not absorb certain 

chemicals and should be healed by G-d or 
natural means. 

As far as the first objection goes, it 

primarily applies to vaccines that use the 
HEK-293 and HeLa cell lines. The former 
comes from the tissue of a fetus electively 
aborted in 1973, and the latter comes from 
the cervical tissue of Henrietta Lacks, a 
Black woman who was diagnosed with 
cervical cancer in the mid-twentieth 
century. Both cases create ethical dilemmas 
— vaccines using the HEK-293 cell line 
may be objectionable to those religiously 
opposed to abortion, and vaccines using 
the HeLa cell line are morally questionable 
because Henrietta Lacks’s tissue was taken 
and developed nonconsensually. 

However, these ethical concerns do not 

apply to the primary COVID-19 vaccines 
in circulation. The Pfizer and Moderna 
vaccines are both developed with chemical, 
not biological, synthesis so they do not 
contain any human cell tissue. While the 
moral concerns regarding the HEK-293 
and HeLa cell raise compelling points that 

should be explored and developed, they do 
not pertain to the COVID-19 vaccine, which 
must be administered widely and urgently.

As far as the objection relating to the 

sanctity of the human body goes, it has no 
grounds in scripture or religious laws, as 
previously stated. Suppose you’re standing 
in front of a crowd of 100 people, and you’re 
offered a mysterious liquid. You are told 
truthfully that the liquid is not dangerous 
to your health or well-being, but it doesn’t 
taste very good and you don’t know exactly 
what’s in it. If you do not drink the liquid, 
all 100 people will be forced to eat a cookie 
that could potentially kill them or cause 
them great harm. If you do drink the liquid, 
35 of the 100 people will be forced to eat the 
cookie. What do you do?

My assumption is that most would drink 

the liquid, despite it being unappetizing 
and unknown. Similarly, most do not 
know what goes into a vaccine, and some 
minimal negative consequences, such as 
chills, tiredness and joint pain, can result 
from receiving one. But, when drinking 

that metaphorical liquid has the potential 
to save a significant number of people 
(studies have shown that one dose of the 
main COVID-19 vaccines may offer 50-80% 
protection against symptomatic COVID-19), 
an individual’s own perceived sacredness of 
their body matters little. 

Anyone who uses their religion to get 

out of a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes 
available has no solid grounds on which to 
argue. The majority of religions practiced 
in the U.S. have no indication of opposition 
to vaccines. There are no constitutional 
obligations to allow people to opt out 
of a vaccine if receiving it would have a 
significant positive impact on national 
health. Ethically, it makes the most sense 
to be administered the vaccine. So, in the 
case of a national COVID-19 vaccination 
mandate, religious exemptions must not be 
sustained because, by nature, they aren’t 
religious at all.

W

hen the United States 
Capitol was stormed 
during the certifying of 

the election, many of us in Michigan 
saw immediate parallels to the recent 
political extremism in our own 
state. Following the insurrection in 
Washington, D.C., it is imperative that 
we work to address political violence 
by banning all weapons from the 
Capitol building and holding elected 
officials accountable for their violent 
rhetoric.

In April of last year, a large group 

of armed protestors who were angry 
about the state’s COVID-19 lockdown 
entered the Michigan State Capitol in 
Lansing, Mich. The scene inside the 
Capitol showed many aggressive and 
agitated demonstrators harassing 
legislators and Capitol police while 
dressed in military fatigues and toting 
semi-automatic weapons. Some of 
the people at the demonstration were 
identified as being part of far-right 
militia groups. 

After this intimidation at the 

Michigan Capitol, many Democrats 
in Lansing pushed to change the 
rules that allowed for people to 
carry firearms into the Capitol. 
Unfortunately, there was no change in 
the gun rules because of obstruction 
by the Republican leadership which 

refused to ban weapons from the 
Capitol building. Months later, the 
world witnessed a similar attack on 
a larger and more dangerous scale at 
our nation’s capital. That riot led to 
the death of five people — including a 
Capitol police officer — and two more 
officers took their own lives afterward.

Following 
the 
armed 
protest 

at 
the 
Michigan 
State 
Capitol, 

representatives in Lansing eventually 
decided to take the small step of 
banning open carry of weapons inside 
the Michigan Capitol. While this is an 
important change, it does not go far 
enough. The change only applies to 
openly carried weapons, meaning that 
people with a concealed carry pistol 
permit can still legally carry a hidden 
weapon into the Michigan Capitol. 

The political violence that we have 

seen in Michigan has been furthered 
not only by lax gun laws but also by our 
very own elected officials. Michigan 
Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, 
R-Jackson, has come under fire for 
his comments and actions that have 
lent credence to violent groups and 
movements in Michigan. 

Shirkey 
has 
long 
been 
an 

adversary of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 
consistently working to oppose her 
agenda. Recently, he has resorted to 
making many bizarre and misogynistic 

comments about the governor, such as 
his sexist comments about her looks 
and his discussion about “spanking 
her” on the state budget. His comments 
and actions sometimes threaten or 
promote violence, including when 
he said he would like to fist fight the 
governor on the Capitol lawn and was 
caught on a hot mic saying that the Jan. 
6 Capitol attack in Washington, D.C., 
was a hoax. 

Shirkey has not only promoted 

violence with his words but also 
with his actions. He has liaised with 
far-right militia leaders in Michigan 
and earlier this year, he met with the 
leaders of multiple militia groups to 
help them with their public perception.

His actions against the governor 

have been even more concerning due 
to the credible threats of violence 
against Whitmer. In October 2020, 
the FBI announced that it had 
arrested multiple members of a 
far-right militia who were actively 
planning to kidnap and harm the 
governor. Even after learning about 
the plot against the governor, Sen. 
Shirkey still made positive comments 
about militias and how “they are not 
uniquely different from you and me.”

hile Angell’s legacy 
is 
complex 
— 
and 

potentially problematic 

— it is unlikely that more than a small 
percentage of the students that walk 
through the doors of Angell Hall are 
aware of this legacy. 

Amid a nationwide reckoning with 

the memorialization of controversial 
historical figures, the University 
must also partake in increasing our 
efforts to thoroughly understand the 
leaders we choose to highlight on 
campus, including Angell. 

Angell 
served 
as 
University 

President from 1871 to 1909. During 
his 38 year tenure as president, 
the University’s enrollment more 
than tripled. He was adamant that 
education be accessible to all, not 
just for the elite. To this point, he 
emphasized the admission of first-
generation college students; in 1880, 
fewer than one in four students 
had parents with a college degree. 
Angell also oversaw the first female 
students to join the University at the 
beginning of his term in 1870 and 1871 
and later became a vocal supporter of 
co-education. 

Angell saw education as a public 

service 
and 
greatly 
expanded 

resources for faculty research to 
this end. Under his leadership, the 
number of departments on campus 
grew from three to seven and the 
number of professors went from 35 to 
250. Historian James Tobin asserted 
that it was Angell who supported the 
University in becoming the leading 
public university in the country.

These details make it clear 

why the University would want to 
honor Angell’s legacy — and they 
have done so through a myriad of 
memorialization, the Angell Scholars 
and Angell Hall being the most 
well-known. Notably, the University 
highlights much of this history in its 
descriptions of Angell online. 

But the full story of Angell’s work 

is more complex: In 1880, during his 
tenure as University President, he 
was a diplomat under Rutherford B. 
Hayes and renegotiated the United 
States’ ability to restrict immigration 
from China. The treaty produced, 

named after Angell himself, opened 
the door for one of the most racist 
immigration 
bills 
in 
American 

history: the Chinese Exclusion Act, 
the first and only major federal 
law suspending immigration for a 
specific nationality. 

The act, signed in 1882 by 

President 
Chester 
A. 
Arthur, 

prohibited all Chinese laborers from 
immigrating to the U.S., leaving 
only Chinese diplomats and their 
servants with the right to enter the 
country. Additionally, all non-citizen 
Chinese laborers who had previously 
immigrated to the country were 
barred from becoming citizens, and 
Chinese citizens who left the U.S. 
had to obtain special permission to 
re-enter.

While Angell himself was not 

directly involved in the creation or 
passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, 
his negotiation of the Angell Treaty 
did pave the way for it. This treaty 
revoked the Burlingame Treaty of 
1868, which had previously granted 
special privileges to citizens of China 
and encouraged large-scale Chinese 
immigration. Shortly after revoking 
the Burlingame Treaty, the U.S. 
government chose to ban nearly all 
Chinese immigration, subsequently 
resulting in the passage of the 
Chinese Exclusion Act. 

Angell’s history is thus more 

complicated 
than 
often 
first 

presented and we, as a university, 
need to reckon with it. That being 
said, it is imperative that this 
reckoning extends past a debate over 
whether or not his name belongs on 
school buildings or honors titles — 
such a debate is inherently temporary 
and denies U-M students the ability 
to honestly discuss and understand 
our history. Moreover, the removal 
of a name from a building does little 
in creating a platform through which 
to discuss the positive and negative 
aspects of a figure’s legacy. 

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board 
recommends 
that 
the 

University establish some variety of an 
official, transparent forum in which 
students and faculty may honestly 
discuss important and complicated 

issues of the University’s history, 
which include, but are not limited 
to, Angell’s legacy. This can take a 
number of forms: perhaps a one or 
two-credit mini-course that teaches 
about important figures and events of 
the University, or a section of student 
orientation with a similar focus. 

Angell’s history is a great case 

study given that his history, like 
many others, cannot be categorized 
binarily as good or bad. Forums 
like those we suggest would allow 
students to actually learn about 
these issues, engaging with history 
through a more holistic and critical-
thinking approach. 

It is difficult to predict whether 

such 
a 
course 
or 
orientation 

component would be accepted by 
faculty and students, or if it would 
be 
considered 
an 
inconvenient 

obligation. Nevertheless, a forum 
of some sort, regardless of if it 
manifests in this manner, should be 
implemented. 

Understanding the University’s 

history is important, especially 
when its prominent figures are 
so frequently celebrated without 
context. 
Angell’s 
history 
could 

therefore act as a springboard for 
implementing heightened University 
resources on other historical figures 
and influences that shape the 
community we know today. 

Ultimately, we need to collectively 

address the memorialization of those 
who came before us and, therefore, 
set the tone of the virtues and values 
the University aims to uphold. In 
these continued conversations of 
reckoning with our University’s 
past, we must also acknowledge 
the gray area that many of these 
historic figures fall into — James B. 
Angell was able to accomplish some 
admirable goals, yet his past is not 
just the positive narrative publicized 
and memorialized by the University. 

It is the responsibility of our 

institution 
and 
its 
community 

members to explore the foundations 
of this University and create a 
better scaffolding for navigating our 
understanding of such history going 
forward.

I

t is well known that the 
University of Michigan is one of 
the country’s most consistently 

left-leaning educational institutions. 
It is hoisted up by a predominantly 
liberal student body that spews 
progressive thought in the residence 
halls and holds hot debate in the 
lecture halls. The strong progressive 
foundation 
that 
the 
University 

upholds appears to be cemented in 
blue — with a pinch of maize of course 
— but it is important to recognize 
not being able to vote wasn’t the only 
thing women on campus weren’t able 
to do within the past century. 

With all of the controversial topics 

that remain unresolved from this past 
year — sexual misconduct scandals, 
weak COVID-19 plans, etc. — let us 
reflect on the past for insight on how 
to prevent history from repeating 
itself.

It was not until 1956 that women 

were permitted to enter the Michigan 
Union through the front door, a lifted 
restriction that was revolutionary for 
students at the time. With progress 
comes its stipulations; upon entering, 
female students were banned from 
using the Pendleton Library. Why? 
To “preserve some spark of the ‘for 
men only’ tradition,” according to 
a 1957 publication of The Michigan 
Daily. This spark has now fizzled, but 
the fires of the feminist movement 
have run their course through the 
University since its founding. 

Ann Arbor’s own Annie Smith 

Peck was one of the first women 
admitted to the University, most 
known for her refusal to let gender 
norms prevent her from scaling both 
the mountains of a patriarchal society 
and actual ones. In 1895, she dropped 
her skirt to scale the Matterhorn, 
famously 
photographed 
touting 

trousers as she made the climb. Upon 
descending 14,692 feet from the peak 
and back to campus, she faced major 
criticism over her slacks. 

“She provoked moral outrage 

with her daring and eccentric 
climbing outfit: a hip-length tunic, 
knickerbockers, stout boots and 

woolen hose, topped off by a stout 
felt hat with a veil,” writes Charles T. 
Robinson for Yankee. Such outrage 
even culminated in a public debate 
centering around whether or not Peck 
should be arrested for her crime of 
pants-wearing.

For some, it may be hard to 

believe that the streets of Ann Arbor, 
now home to its own category of 
“hipster” fashion, once restricted 
women to skirts and dresses and 
that debates held on the steps of the 
Union or bricks on the Diag were 
for a right-wing cause rather than 
left. However, there is a reason why 
female trousers were left tucked away 
in wardrobes and entrance to the 
Union was restricted, and that reason, 
put simply, is men. Where there is an 
intermingling of the sexes, the male 
gaze that we women either dread or 
relish emerges. This inescapable gaze 
is relevant in any time period, creating 
a socialized uniform. 

Back in the 1940s, the minds 

of Michigan men were not only 
consumed with fears of being drafted, 
but apparently the potential of soon 
viewing the outlined legs of women. 
Articles upon articles of The Michigan 
Daily during the early 1900s detail the 
dress code of the proper and rational 
Ann Arbor woman. One 1941 story 
details different dress combinations 
for 
every 
Michigan 
freshman, 

describing a skirt as a “necessity” in 
order to follow with the University’s 
lean towards conservatism and the 
standards of being desirable. The 
campus that was once considered one 
of the more right-leaning campuses 
of the east must surely be a different 
campus than the one we walk through 
today. It is not the same campus it was 
60 years ago, but that is thanks to the 
women who changed it.

It wasn’t until the 1960s, roughly 65 

years after Peck’s climb, that counter-
culture had finally hit its peak and 
enacted change in dress reform. 
Something practical in nature, meant 
to provide protection and flexibility 
all while promoting productivity, 
takes form in pants. An everyday 

clothing item that nowadays is stuffed 
in our drawers once represented 
equality, power and freedom. 

Fast forward to present society, 

the great legging debate continues 
to upset the nation and college 
campuses. It was just three short years 
ago United Airlines sparked outrage 
when an employee denied two young 
girls from boarding a flight due to 
their infamous tight pants. It was only 
one year ago when a woman named 
Maryann White published a letter 
in Notre Dame’s student newspaper 
asking girls to eliminate leggings from 
their wardrobe under the belief that 
leggings “make it difficult to ignore 
young women’s bodies.” 

These instances of the lack of male 

accountability rekindle the fire that 
women have fiercely sought to snuff. 
That mother (and other mothers) 
argue that there’s a generational gap 
that justifies their views, but this holds 
no avail on our campus. Growing 
up in a different generation is not an 
excuse for policing women’s clothing 
choices nor for the lack of male 
self-control. This issue is not a new 
concept with the advent of leggings 
but is in fact generational, making us 
only hope that Peck would be proud of 
a new kind of pants that has scaled yet 
another sexist mountain.

The progressive roots that the 

University appears to be grounded in 
do not run as deep as one may think. 
Recognizing 
these 
shortcomings 

in modern history is important to 
achieve further progress. 

Entering the Union takes on a 

whole new meaning knowing that, 
at one point, I — and the now 14,432 
women that call this campus home 
— would not have been able to open 
the ornate wooden doors at the main 
entrance. As I am writing this article, 
I have my feet perched on a chair 
in the skylit courtyard, sporting my 
leggings. Something as simple as this 
is a small victory that we are not to

Acknowledging Angell — we need a 
comprehensive U-M history lesson

FROM THE DAILY

I

n the coming weeks, select students in the College of Literature, 
Science & the Arts will receive an email congratulating them for 
being named James B. Angell Scholars. The award, named for the 

University of Michigan’s third president, celebrates any LSA student who 
receives an “A” record for two consecutive terms at the University. While 
we wish to offer congratulations for these students’ diligent dedication 
to their studies, it is also critical to learn about the award’s namesake.


7-Opinion

A

s a freshman attending my second 
semester of classes, I came across 
one phrase in all of my courses: 

office hours. From what I gathered, it was 
a valuable resource for students looking to 
interact with professors and other teaching 
staff. It provided a smaller and more 
intimate setting for students to clear doubts 
and build professional relationships. Best 
of all, attendance was optional! Little did 
I know that few courses would actually be 
treating their office hours as a mandatory 
extension of the class. 

To be clear, I’m not referring to scenarios 

where a few students regularly attend 
office hours to cope with challenging 
material. That is the purpose of office 
hours, and I’m in no way advocating for 
that to end. After all, we’re here to explore 
new topics, not to coast along on existing 
knowledge. I’ve had many instances where 
office hours have helped me further my 
understanding in a class. 

Office hours are a beneficial resource. 

Then why should they ever be an issue? 

For starters, office hours don’t affect 

the credit hours of the course. We aren’t 
supposed to account for office hours 
while planning out a course schedule for 
a semester. Consequently, office hours 
often clash with other items on a person’s 
timetable. Even if they don’t overlap 
with other meetings, students — some 
studying remotely from different time 
zones, like myself — can’t attend some 
time slots. When you factor in other time 

commitments like clubs, the available 
time slots shrink even further. The issue 
becomes worse with some smaller courses 
since the instructors are only available at 
rather specific times. Hence, office hours 
aren’t always accessible for some. This 
deprives many students of a chance to 
attend them, especially in courses with a 
small staff.

In normal circumstances, this wouldn’t 

be an issue. However, when success in 
a class depends on attending them, this 
creates a performance divide. These are 
cases where the majority of students are 
attending office hours regularly and I can 
personally attest to being in such classes. 
While the overall material was enjoyable, 
it was highly draining to have to attend yet 
another meeting.

Why does this happen? In my 

experience, 
there 
was 
a 
disparity 

between what we covered in class and 
our assignments. One might be inclined 
to interject here by saying that’s part of 
the challenge of college. However, when 
assignments are representative of the 
lectures, instructors wouldn’t cover any 
new material in office hours. Instead, 
they would prefer pointing you in the 
right direction with subtle hints. With the 
disparity, it seemed like instructors were 
content deferring instruction to office 
hours rather than adjusting the course to 
cover the requisite material for homework. 
Other instances included compensating 
for poor pacing in online lectures during 

office hours. Either way, it blurred the 
“optional” element, instead turning them 
into supplemental lectures of sorts.

The frustrating part was the impact of 

this on students. The workload between 
weeks didn’t necessarily depend on the 
underlying material but on whether I 
attended office hours. I saw some peers 
drop the course because they couldn’t 
attend the extra meetings — the workload 
was overwhelming them. 

Here’s the thing; it doesn’t have to be like 

this. I saw many approaches to this issue 
that worked much better. A few courses 
that were offered asynchronously decided 

to hold office hours during the slated lecture 
times, thereby ensuring that everyone 
would have access to them, if necessary. 
Another course opted to carve some time in 
the lecture for a makeshift discussion to deal 
with some applications of the theory. Many 
courses avoided the problem altogether 
by basing assignments purely on material 
covered in lectures instead of delegating 
the necessary instructions to office hours. 
Computer science courses, specifically, 
offered a queue-based office hours platform 
that I felt was ideal for courses with a larger 
staff size. The new remote format offers 
many unorthodox solutions; it’s time for 

instructors to capitalize on them.

The pandemic has definitely made life 

harder for students: We don’t need to be 
actively impeded by the course structure. 
It’s time for instructors that turn office 
hours into another lecture to stop saying 
that “we’re all in this together in these 
unprecedented circumstances.” I’d much 
rather infer that they care about us from 
the structure of the course, instead of a 
token acknowledgment that serves as a 
cover to place more work on us.

I

t all started in a car. I couldn’t tell you 
how old I was or where we were going, 
but I remember distinctly the first time I 

appreciated The Beatles the way I do now. My 
dad, now owner of a music publishing company 
based in Nashville, Tenn., has ingrained a 
comprehensive music education in me and my 
siblings — beginning with my bedtime lullaby, 
“My Girl” by The Temptations. In that car, on 
that day, I realized something that I will now 
gladly argue to anyone at any time: The Beatles 
are forever. 

Since that moment, I have listened to every 

Beatles song in existence. I’ve had the life-
changing opportunity to see Paul McCartney in 
concert twice and have unforgettable memories 
belting “Helter Skelter”, “Oh! Darling” and 
“Eleanor Rigby” with a 70-something-year-old 
Paul. My laptop, walls and Spotify Wrapped 
have been eternally overwhelmed by The Fab 
Four, and I can confidently say that nobody will 
ever take their place. 

All of this to say that I am my father’s 

daughter in that I have utilized my 
appreciation for bands like The Beatles, 
Queen, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, etc., 
to encourage exploration of all genres and 
decades of music. Anyone who knows me 
knows the nature of my Spotify playlists 
transcends all times and variations of music; 
from Chance the Rapper’s “Hot Shower” to 
Bobby Darin’s “Dream Lover” and back again. 
My appreciation for and love of music all is 
thanks to The Beatles. Therefore, it truly is all 
thanks to my dad. 

I have met few people in my life who have 

the audacity to make statements such as “I 

don’t like The Beatles,” or “Yellow Submarine 
is a terrible song,” but nonetheless it’s worth 
addressing for those that have. 

For me, understanding their humble 

beginnings underscores the magnitude 
of appreciation they demand. The Beatles 
began as a group of four young boys from 
Liverpool, 
England. 
15-year-old 
Paul 

McCartney was invited to join 16-year-
old John Lennon’s band and after a series 
of additional member changes, the rest is 
history. While my short column cannot 
effectively do justice to this sensational 
story of the beginning brewings of the 
British Invasion, I have watched and 
encourage everyone to watch the plethora 
of documentaries made about The Beatles. 

In 1964 — coincidentally, the same 

year my dad was born — The Beatles 
came to the U.S. and made their first live 
American television debut on “The Ed 
Sullivan Show.” But the band’s prolific 
nature became a problem for its individual 
members. As George Harrison further 
pursued his own interest in song-writing, 
they began to have difficult decisions to 
make: What songs would be recorded 
and, even more challenging, what songs 
would be performed? This led to their hard 
but historically well-received decision to 
take a step back from the stage and focus 
instead on experimenting in the studio. If 
you have ever listened to the album titled 
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, 
you know exactly what I’m talking about — 
and if you haven’t, what are you still doing 
reading this column? 

The Beatles officially broke up in 1970, but 

years later are revered for the ways in which 
they permanently changed the game of music. 
Time and time again, today’s top artists will 
announce their primary musical inspiration 
as The Beatles even in the unexpected genre 
of rap. This article displays it perfectly by 
citing explicit Beatles references and times 
that artists such as Wayne and Mac Miller 
paid homage to The Beatles. 

I recognize that not all music is for 

everyone. Some people exclusively take to 
one genre or artist or sound, and I respect 
that perspective. As someone who relies on 
music to provide a soundtrack to my life in 
more ways than one, I can understand the 
specificity that comes with choosing music 
that speaks to you. 

However, I will argue until the day I die 

that everyone has a Beatles song that will 
speak to them. This is simply because The 
Beatles do not fit in a box; they are a genre 

within themselves. In this chaotic world we 
continue to navigate through, take a second to 
pause whatever it is you’re listening to and play 
something by The Beatles — anything at all. 

To end this article, I’d like to say something 

that I’m not sure I say enough about my 
unmatched love for The Beatles: thank you, 
Dad. 

A

ll eyes have been on Texas for the past 
10 days as a “once in a lifetime” winter 
storm knocked out power and left 

millions of Texans without electricity and heat 
in freezing temperatures. In the days following 
the initial power outage Republicans, including 
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have taken to Fox News 
and other media outlets to proclaim that wind 
turbines, renewable energy, the Green New Deal 
and even U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., are to blame. In reality, this couldn’t be 
farther from the truth. Texas’s infrastructure, 
although unique, represents a bigger issue in the 
United States — its power grid is dangerously 
old and out of date. Texas should be seen as 
a warning to the rest of the country that the 
climate crisis is here. Being unprepared will put 
millions in harm’s way. 

So if it wasn’t the Green New Deal or 

renewable energy, what actually caused the 
Texas power outages? That question comes 
with a response that is very on-brand for Texas. 
The contiguous 48 states have three separate 
power grids: Eastern Interconnection, Western 
Interconnection and Texas. Their power grid 
is called the Electricity Reliability Council of 
Texas. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed 
the Federal Power Act in 1935, which gave the 
federal government oversight over electricity 
sales — but Texas, which did not want to be 
subject to federal regulations, adopted its own 
power grid. 35 years after the Federal Power Act, 
ERCOT was formed and tasked with managing 
the grid’s reliability. In short, Texas has its own 
electricity grid to avoid dealing with the federal 
government. 

Those who chose to blame the Green New 

Deal for Texas’s power failures have already 
been receiving backlash for their false or 
misleading claims. ERCOT predicted just 7% 
of their anticipated winter energy capacity 
would come from wind power sources around 
the state. All energy sources have struggled 
during the sub-freezing temperatures in Texas, 

but the majority of energy production failures 
came from natural gas and coal plants. Blaming 
renewable energy, although baseless and 
scientifically inaccurate, is one thing. However, 
blaming the Green New Deal, a policy proposal 
that has not been implemented in Texas or 
federally and has yet to even be brought to the 
floor in Congress, is a whole other level of mental 
gymnastics.

Not only did Texas isolate itself from the 

rest of the country in terms of energy, but their 
officials repeatedly ignored warnings that 
this exact situation could happen. Ten years 
ago, a similar disaster struck Texas. Freezing 
temperatures froze natural gas wells, wind 
turbines and coal plants. Texas’s government 
and regulatory officials had the opportunity 
to learn from prior mistakes and winterize 
their energy infrastructure to prevent future 
statewide blackouts. However, they left the 
decision to prepare for cold weather up to 
the individual companies who passed on the 
upgrades, citing high cost. Texas officials, both 
in the public and private sector, chose to forgo 
infrastructure updates because of the cost, 
stranding millions of Texans — who had no say 
in the matter — without heat or water in freezing 
cold situations. 

This 
infrastructure 
problem 
is 
not 

isolated to Texas. The American Society of 
Civil Engineers puts out a comprehensive 
infrastructure report card every few years 
grading America’s infrastructure. The most 
recent report from 2017 gave the U.S. a D+. 
This grade is unacceptable, especially in the 
richest country in the world. 

Yet, this was not the first time it received 

that grade. In 2013, the U.S. also received a 
D+ and it was estimated that the U.S. would 
need to invest an estimated 3.6 trillion dollars 
by the year 2020 in order to upgrade its 
infrastructure. 

It is clear that the U.S. needs to drastically 

modernize its infrastructure and energy 

systems. As climate change and rising 
temperatures weaken the jet stream, it is no 
longer strong enough to contain the polar vortex 
in the North Pole. This causes what is called 
a “wavy polar vortex,” meaning it is no longer 
restricted by latitude and parts of the extremely 
cold, low-pressure climate system dip down into 
typically warm areas like Texas. New regions 
will experience climatic events they have 
never experienced before and they need to be 
prepared. 

As we see more and more of this increasing 

uncertainty surrounding the climate, there 
are only so many things that we can do as 
humans and as a society. One of those things 
is to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure so 
we are better prepared next time there are 
freezing temperatures in places where they 
are not usually expected. This strategy can 
also be flipped as colder places should similarly 
prepare for warmer weather. Infrastructure 
includes the obvious roads, bridges and tunnels 
but also encompasses public transportation, 
energy, schools, public parks and drinking water 
systems, among many other things. Improving 
these integral parts of society both structurally 
and to increase efficiency would create millions 
of jobs while making the U.S. a safer place. 

As climate projections are fluid and leave 

room for unexpected events it is important to 
over prepare so that there are no situations that 
catch society off guard. There are no downsides 
to acting boldly and transforming and revitalizing 
our infrastructure and energy systems. The 
downsides come from a lack of action. 

What’s going on in Texas is a wake-up call 

to the rest of the country to listen to experts 
and prepare for what is coming. Government 
officials have been offered a golden opportunity 
and they must take it, or millions of lives will be 
destroyed.

T

hough there is some debate about the 
origins of the word “religion,” I am par-
tial to the sense derived from the Latin 

religare (“to bind” or “to fasten”). The image 
suggests that religion involves connection and 
commitment — connection to something out-
side of yourself and, through the act of connec-
tion, sincere commitment to certain practices 
and beliefs. 

Religion, of course, encompasses more 

than this single definition can capture. There 
is a multiplicity of religious experience in our 
world, and thousands of variations of religious 
life outside the dominant religions of Christi-
anity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Juda-
ism. Religion is a near-universal facet of hu-
man experience and a matter of both intense 
spiritual and emotional interest for individuals. 
It is a subject of infinite scope, and yet each of 
us occupies only a single point within its vast 
domain. It is therefore with great humility that 
I approach the topic, acknowledging the singu-
larity of my perspective within this labyrinth of 
presuppositions about what religion really is.

Even as someone who lacks belief in a God 

or gods, my perspective on religion is a matter of 
sustained reflection, albeit from a different ap-
proach than that of believers. Atheists must nav-
igate a predominantly religious world, a fact that 
produces as much variation within atheist life 
as it does within religious life. And though I am 
an atheist out of honesty to myself, the anxieties 
of life and frequent plunges into cynicism stem-
ming from religious detachment have foamed 
within me and produced a question I must ad-
dress: Would I be better off believing in God?

From the moment I understood myself to 

be an atheist, the temptation to religion has 
constantly lurked beneath my awareness, oc-
casionally elevating itself in fits of indignation. 
For this, the benign presence of religion was 
instrumental.

For instance, even though I had a secular 

upbringing, religion was always in the back-
ground. For kindergarten, I went to a Montes-
sori school — a type of school premised on har-
nessing the natural curiosity of children in the 
basement of an Episcopal church. Though I 
never met him, my great-grandfather, an Angli-
can priest in central England, would have been 
proud to see his great-grandson in the Ameri-
can equivalent of his denomination.

For elementary school, I went to a local 

public school in my home city of Washing-
ton, D.C., which is basically as secular as you 
can get. The school officials strictly followed 
the First Amendment ban on school-spon-
sored religion; we never said the Pledge of 
Allegiance, which posits the U.S. as “one na-
tion under God,” nor did we have religiously-
tinged Christmas assemblies. There was no 
stigma attached to religion, but I did have a 

sense growing up that religion was something 
for the private, not the public sphere.

It was during middle school that I began 

to have some more exposure to religion in 
the way of bar- and bat-mitzvahs, the coming 
of age ritual in Judaism. Throughout seventh 
grade, I went to more than a dozen of these cel-
ebrations for friends, which meant I visited the 
local temple at least as many times as my local 
Episcopal church. This was not my first time 
hearing Hebrew, however. For a while, both of 
my next-door neighbors were Jewish. On oc-
casion, my little brother and I would be invited 
to one of their houses for Friday-night Shabbat 
dinner, where we would listen to the blessings.

Throughout high school, I continued to 

learn about religion in my English and his-
tory courses. While we didn’t have a religious 
education specifically, we did read the Gospel 
of Mark and some extracts from the Old Testa-
ment of the Bible in tenth-grade English class. 
I also picked up things here and there from 
texts with major religious themes, especially 
Gothic novels and stories like those of Charles 
Dickens, William Faulkner and Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, as well as Toni Morrison’s novels, 
including “Beloved,” and “Song of Solomon.”

Nearing the end of my senior year, however, 

I was still not an avowed atheist. The existence 
of God felt like a remote possibility, but the 
question itself never bothered me — at least, 
not like it does now.

More than anything else, it was my first en-

counter with philosophy at the age of 17 that 
presented me with the life and language of 
atheism.

Just a few weeks before my high school 

graduation, I read Albert Camus’s “The Strang-
er” for the first time. The ideas within the text 
leaped out and spoke to me with an urgency I 
had never experienced before. As I held it in 
my hands, the book had the simultaneous aura 
of a precious gem and a great burning flame 
that threatened to swallow me up. For me, it 
was an atheist revelation.

The concept at the heart of “The Stranger” 

is the “absurdity” of human existence. The ab-
surd does not refer to an innate irrationality 
of human nature; rather, it expresses the con-
tradiction of humanity’s search for meaning 
in a universe where there is none to be found 
through the faculties of science, logic, reason 
and faith. Meursault, the understated protag-
onist of “The Stranger,” arrives at an under-
standing of the absurd at the end of the novel. 
His reaction of revolt, rather than despair, 
against this absurd condition presented to me 
the most paradoxical yet attractive aspect of 
Camusian thought.

It follows from Camus’s skepticism that re-

ligion cannot serve as a source of meaning. Ac-
cording to Camus, clinging onto objective truth 

and divine authority is an expression of defeat, 
of caving into the absurdity of existence by de-
nying it. In his view, the Christian hope for a life 
in heaven is a deep error because of its diminu-
tion of existence on Earth. 
W

hile the constant reminder of the 
meaningless of existence can lead 
to disparate ideas, to me, existen-

tialism represented a radical, life-affirming 
philosophy — an approach to existence that 
sparked my imagination and invited me to re-
flect on my place in an infinite universe.

In my raptures, however, there was a certain 

part of Camus’s thought that I did not take to 
heart; because theistic religion has served for 
centuries as the principal well of meaning and 
purpose, it is still deeply ingrained in the social 
and spiritual life of millions. Overzealous athe-
ists threaten to run the well dry for the sake 
of affirming a philosophical truth, causing a 
drought of global proportions and the spiritual 
suffocation of the entire religious world.

I also failed to appreciate the gravity of 

losing faith upon my first few readings of the 
19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. 
In “The Gay Science,” Nietzsche writes of a 
madman running into town with a lantern in 
broad daylight shouting, “I seek God! I seek 
God!” The scene is ridiculous, though the ap-
parent humor is a veil for the seriousness of Ni-
etzsche’s infamous announcement that “God 
is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed 
him.”

The “Parable of The Madman at first gave 

me great reassurance as a young atheist. I 
found the notion of the death of God ecstatic, 
its articulation courageous on the part of its 
author. I thought the death of God signified 
liberation from religious fundamentalism, holy 
wars and the caprice of religious influence in 
politics. In other words, I believed the death of 
God constitutes freedom, and freedom is the 
most sublime condition of humanity. However, 
to my detriment, I ignored the less satisfying 
part: “How shall we, the murderers of all mur-
ders, comfort ourselves?”

***
Why would atheists need to comfort our-

selves? What, after all, is the danger of breaking 
the ties that link us to God?

In my experience, disconnection works on 

several broad levels. First, there is the discon-
nection from a higher power, a source of objec-
tive meaning that offers to resolve much inner 
conflict. Second, there is the disconnection from 
a religious community, that sentiment that one 
has the support of people of shared values and 
beliefs. Third, there is the disconnection from 
religious tradition, the passing down of religious 
teachings and practices across centuries and po-
tentially across continents.

The apparent importance of religion, its 

widespread visibility and its embedding in so-
ciety can thus create feelings of alienation in 
those who have never been a part of religious 
life. I am not proposing that atheists lack the 
same moral faculties as those who base their 
ethics from scripture or oral teachings. There 
is, however, a fundamental relationship be-
tween faith and self-affirmation. And in mo-
ments of distress and self-doubt, the surety of 
religious life and the support of the religious 
community suddenly presents itself as an at-
tractive alternative.

The moment of crisis for an atheist, then, 

differs from the crisis of faith that menaces 
the believer. The believer remains tethered to 
God, community and tradition throughout this 
crisis, whereas the atheist, generally speaking, 
does not have recourse to the support of these 
mooring posts.

Some atheists search for comfort in the 

company of other atheists in an institutional 
setting. Self-described secular congregations, 
such as the Sunday Assembly, offer atheists a 
chance to connect in a setting reminiscent of 
the religious temples they may have left be-
hind. Similarly, online forums or discussion 
boards like r/Atheism launch unbelievers into 
the digital sphere, where sensitive discussions 
about religion can be protected with the prom-
ise of online anonymity, or the confidence that 
comes from the belief that things said on the In-
ternet have fewer consequences than things said 
with the undulating breath of one’s own voice.

However, despite atheists having strong 

views on religion, the prospect of promoting 
atheism as a universal alternative to religion in 
these settings has seemed awkward to me, like 
some form of proselytization. Anything resem-
bling Atheist Church leaps out as a dangerous 
contradiction, a slippery slope to be avoided 
at all costs. Most believers, Christians for in-
stance, are linked by a set of positive beliefs 
about God, religious observance and ethical 
mores. Though there are always exceptions, 
Christians by definition will agree that Jesus of 
Nazareth was the son of God, the Messiah, and 
that certain events — His death, descent into 
Hell, resurrection and Second Coming — are of 
either historical, literal or metaphorical truth.

There is, however, no doctrine of atheism, 

historical or otherwise. Instead, there is an ab-
sence of doctrine — an intentional embrace of 
nothingness — that is central to atheist identity. 
In my view, attempts to formalize atheism into 
institutions often represent an attempt to incar-
nate this nothingness. Even if the intention is to 
provide a meeting place for people of like minds, 
such positive establishments of atheism run the 
risk of reaching the height of contradiction.

Yes, there are compelling political reasons 

for atheists to organize themselves as a group; 
for instance, to combat state-sponsored estab-
lishment of religion in public schools. Howev-
er, detaching oneself from God can also mean a 
detachment from convictions based on objec-
tive truth, including one’s own.

And still, moments of solidarity between 

atheists are important. These moments render 
explicit an unavowed feeling for non-believers: 
that the absence of belief presents challenges 
of its own, yet these challenges can be met with 
the certainty that one has been authentic with 
oneself. The central realizations of atheism may 
be apoint of no return; even if belief returns to 
the soul, there might always remain the perma-
nently awakened spirit of doubt in the mind.

Finding community as an atheist is possible, 

too, for outside of religion there are abundant 
opportunities for engaging with others. To ac-
cept the abstraction of metaphysical solitude 
opens the world to new possibilities of con-
nection. The relationship with God may be 
attractive because of the magnitude of God’s 
love. The everlasting forgiveness and peace 
one hopes to receive in the afterlife are cause 
for worship and celebration here on Earth. But 
I have been content to find these sentiments in 
the relationships I have with people, places and 
sources of solace in literature, poetry and art; 
music, nature, cold lakes and warm sand.

Working throughout the challenges of athe-

ist life has not been straightforward. The ab-
sence of belief, however, leaves space for other 
modes of connection, and I have hardly been 
alone on my path. If not religion itself, the bind-
ing spirit of religare has tied me to certain peo-
ple and passions I feel I cannot live without. As 
an atheist, it is the ironic necessity of fastening 
these bindings that represents the price of free-
dom. Despite its challenges, it is a freedom I 
never want to give up.

Atheism and disconnection

BY ALEXANDER SATOLA, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

Wednesday, March 3, 2021 — 11


T

his morning I woke up 
with big plans: Go for a 
long walk, catch up on 

“The Daily” podcast episodes 
from The New York Times, fold 
my sweatshirt pile, call my dad, 
finish a finance problem set, 
write an essay, draft this piece. 
At the crack of dawn (10 a.m.), 
I stepped into my Ugg slippers, 
stumbled down two flights of 
stairs in an oversized grey T-
shirt and Monsters Inc. fluffy 
pants and landed in the kitchen. 
I was compelled to walk outside 
and check the weather immedi-
ately after being blinded by the 
sunlight shining through the 
window. To my surprise, I was 
greeted with a gentle warm-ish 
breeze, one that felt unfamiliar 
after a chilling Ann Arbor winter. 
I inhaled the welcoming air with 
a deep breath. And then I did it 
again. And again. 

I closed my eyes. I felt calm. 

I felt peaceful. The sun melted 
away my exhaustion.

After what felt like a moment 

of tranquility, my long list of 
morning plans suddenly came 
flooding back into my mind. I 
pivoted my feet towards the door, 
but something kept me in place 
as I tried to reenter the kitchen. 
I fed the urge to turn back to the 
sun, close my eyes and begin to 
breathe slowly again. I couldn’t 
help but smile. I was resisting the 
urge to move, to do, to achieve. I 
was standing alone in a t-shirt on 
my Joe’s Pizza box-covered back 
porch, and I felt more alive than 
I had in weeks. 

If 2020 has shown us anything, 

it is that we never truly know 
what to expect in life. And while 
this uncertainty naturally leads 
to feelings of stress and anxiety, 
it also gives us space to practice 
being comfortable with the un-
known. This so-called “space” 
that I am referring to has been a 
contentious topic throughout the 
pandemic. For example, the al-
leged increase in “time” we now 
have to find new hobbies or to 
relax has been taken advantage 
of by educators and CEOS alike, 
over-assigning and over-expect-
ing from their students and em-
ployees. The faux luxury of time 
that the pandemic has brought 
on has led to intense burnout and 
dangerously busy schedules.

But it is possible to take back 

the time that has been stolen 
away from us by back-to-back 
Zoom meetings and the pressure 
to master crocheting with all 
the freedom we have. Instead of 
asking what-ifs, we can focus on 
what we do know — what is right 
in front of us. We can strive to be 
what my therapist calls process-
oriented, rather than results-ori-
ented. 

I first noticed this distinc-

tion as I reflected on my read-
ing habits. I always have a par-
ticularly difficult time starting a 
new book. My selection process 
is unnecessarily long and usually 
leads to option paralysis, where 
there are so many choices that I 
ultimately end up with nothing. 
There are simply too many books 
in the world and so little time. 
This may explain why walking 
into Barnes & Noble is simulta-
neously exciting and sickening. 
Same with The Salvation Army. 
I digress. 

But if I do decide to embark 

on an intimate endeavor with 
literature, my new and carefully 
selected read often sits on my 
bedside table, lonely, waiting to 
be touched. Sometimes I tease 
the book by picking it up, but this 
is usually just to show a friend 
what I am “currently reading.” 
And all-too-often, I’ll emit the 
familiar line: “Yeah I’m really 
only on page four — haha. So I 
have nothing to report about it 
yet.” 

And I likely won’t for several 

months. Right now, this book is 
the New York Times bestseller 
“Where The Crawdad Sings” by 
Delia Owens. Its cover art hap-
pens to match my cute little pur-
ple lamp. 

When I am finally compelled 

to pick the book up, it takes a sig-
nificant amount of time for me 
to focus on the first few pages. 
I often have to read them over 
twice. Five or six pages in, I flip 
forward to see when the chapter 
will end. 10 more pages! I can do 
this, I think to cheer myself on. I 
continue reading with the goal of 
finishing a chapter. I read with a 
results mindset. 

Flash forward a few weeks 

and I am sitting upright in my 
bed at 3 a.m., my book propped 
up against my knees. Now, I turn 
the pages with less haste and 
more hesitation. I am attached 
to the characters and lost in the 
words on the page. I read with a 
process mindset. 

I try not to read books this 

way, where I don’t start to enjoy 
them until they are about to end. 
Yet unfortunately, this cycle con-
tinually repeats itself. It’s a sad 
truth that applies to more than 
just books: In life, people tend 
to not enjoy things until they are 
over. 

The problem is that people 

are constantly projecting into 
the future and ruminating in the 
past. We have all become victims 
of the attention economy, one 
where so much available infor-
mation and stimuli has created 
a huge attention deficit. Hus-
tle porn, or the fetishization of 
overworking oneself, is another 
force driving people away from 
focusing on the process. And of 
course, our capitalistic attitudes 
don’t help us deter our attention 
away from results. Even mindful-
ness, the antithesis of capitalism, 
has been exploited for profit.

In her book “How to Do Noth-

ing: 
Resisting 
the 
Attention 

Economy,” Jenny Odell urges 
how the very essence of what 
makes us human has become 
threatened by the urge towards 
constant productivity.

“What I’m suggesting is that 

we take a protective stance to-
ward ourselves, each other, and 
whatever is left of what makes us 
human,” Odell writes. “I’m sug-
gesting that we protect our spac-
es and our time for non-instru-
mental, noncommercial activity 
and thought, for maintenance, 
for care, for conviviality. And I’m 
suggesting that we fiercely pro-
tect our human animality against 
all technologies that actively ig-
nore and disdain the body, the 
bodies of other beings, and the 
body of the landscape that we in-
habit.”

Odell 
preaches 
something 

that is essential, especially dur-
ing a pandemic: We must do ev-

erything in our power to focus 
on our humanity and appreciate 
what comes with it rather than 
fighting for what we cannot al-
ways control. I live for an extra 
hour of laughter at the dinner ta-
ble. The sweet sound and seren-
ity of Jimi Hendrix on the high-
way. The passion with which my 
sister plays the piano. Spontane-
ous sing-alongs. The salty taste 
of tears.

We lose a lot when we are not 

in the present. 
B

efore her tragic accident 
in 2012, in her essay “Op-
posite 
of 
Loneliness,” 

Marina Keegan wrote, “The best 
years of our lives are not behind 
us. They’re part of us and they 
are set for repetition as we grow 
up and move to New York and 
away from New York and wish 
we did or didn’t live in New York 
… of course there are things we 
wish we’d done: our readings, 
that boy across the hall. We’re 
our own hardest critics and it’s 
easy to let ourselves down.”

A tweet I recently read said, 

“I feel like I’m constantly worry-
ing about the next part of my life 
without realizing that I’m right 
in the middle of what I used to 
look forward to.” By obsessing 
over everything but the reality 
in front of us, we are depriving 
ourselves of life. Life should not 
(only) be a past experience or a 
future plan — it should be the 
now. 

Take a deep breath right now. 

Where are you? Who are you 
with? How do you feel? Why are 
you reading this? 

The practice of being process-

oriented rather than results-
oriented 
takes 
intentionality. 

Resisting forces such as the at-
tention economy and the pres-
sure to work hard means not only 

seeing the problem but develop-
ing the strength to fight power-
ful tendencies: Don’t constantly 
check your phone in the car, gaze 
out the window; Don’t fill your 
weeks with too many tasks, wel-
come what each day brings. To 
focus on the process means to 
find success in everything (F you 
capitalism!) — learning from fail-
ure, accepting an unproductive 
day, appreciating the little things 
(as demonstrated by Big Mouth’s 
Gratitoad). 

Over time I have discovered 

habits and hobbies that keep me 
grounded, thoughtful and inten-
tional. I avoid going on my phone 
first thing in the morning (I usu-
ally do not succeed — shoutout to 
my Twitter addiction) and instead 
lie on my floor and meditate. 

By no means am I the medita-

tion expert. I’m actually far from 
it. Instead, I have tried to habitu-
ate the practice even if only for 
two minutes a day, using count-
less guided meditation apps that 
never seem to catch on. Recently, 
however, as I lay on a yoga mat on 
my bedroom floor in NYC, I had 
a thought that shifted my medita-
tion practice from being results to 
process-oriented. 

When I (attempt) to meditate, 

I often find my mind wandering 
away from what I am supposed to 
be focusing on, such as my breath. 
I quickly begin to make sched-
ules, construct grocery lists and 
psychoanalyze my relationships. 
This is common for beginners, 
and many times it’s what disin-
centivizes people from continu-
ing with mediation. People are of-
ten motivated by results, creating 
a sense of trouble when sticking 
with the practice because it lacks 
immediate gratification. Instead, 
it is gradually effective. 

My mind may have wandered 

away from my yoga mat and to the 
grocery store, but instead of giv-
ing up, I focused on the moment 
that I returned to my breath. 
Why, at that particular moment, 
had I refocused my energy? I still 
do not have an answer, but I am 
gradually discovering what leads 
my mind astray and what recen-
ters it — the smell of grapefruit, 
an itch on my forehead, footsteps. 
I have stopped caring about doing 
it right. I embrace the process. 

Mediation does not only take 

the form of breathwork or sit-
ting still. I meditate on words as 
I read. I meditate on sounds as 
I listen to music. I meditate on 
movement as I practice yoga, fo-
cusing on each pose and nothing 
else. Laughter, too, is a form of 
meditation.

The process is the weekend to-

do list you make on a legal pad. 
The process of crossing things 
out when they are done. The pro-
cess is being hungover from one 
too many drinks yet still trying 
to muster the energy to do your 
laundry. The excitement of mak-
ing a plan. Introspecting. Laugh-
ing. Waking up. Building a rela-
tionship. Experimenting. Walking 
to an interview. The interview. 
Decision making. The process is 
mindlessly gazing at somebody 
you love because they amaze you. 
Appreciating when somebody 
reaches for your hand. 

The process is writing this 

piece, sitting on my floor, chew-
ing Bubblemint gum, the faint 
sound of “Give Me Everything” 
by Pitbull blasting from a car out-
side, the breeze from my window 
cooling down my sweaty finger-
tips as they hit the keyboard.

I do not even know if this sen-

tence will make it to the final 
draft, but it is certainly a part of 
the process.

“Nothing to me feels as good as laugh-
ing incredibly hard.” 
 

- Steve Carrell
I

n my Notes App, I have a list 
titled “Laughing.” I created 
the page my senior year of 

high school as running documenta-
tion of the things that make me dou-
ble over, gasp for breath and cry el-
ephant tears of laughter. My list is a 
gift that keeps on giving: a reminder 
of all the times I’ve experienced the 
purest form of joy, felt that glori-
ous pain in my abdominals and lost 
all sense of reality beyond whatever 
particular situation struck me funny. 
When I’m down, or even just in the 
mood for a chuckle, I open the app 
and peruse through my humorous 
peaks of life.

The other day, while my friends 

sat on the couch in our apartment, I 
scrolled through my list and landed 
on one to narrate. 

“Oh yeah, that time in Denny’s!” 

I exclaimed. This was a gem of a 
story that I’d since forgotten. “That 
was one hundred percent the hard-
est time I’ve ever laughed,” I told my 
friends. I say that about most things 
on my list, but that time in Denny’s 
— the 24-hour diner chain with a 
unique array of breakfast, seafood 
and American dishes, none of which 
are completely mastered — is defi-
nitely a top two moment. 

I was there one night around 1 a.m. 

with a few of my friends after a high 
school football game. The specials 
menu was already at our table, sport-
ing Denny’s most recent and fresh 
additions. The cover image, a plat-
ter of chocolate spheres of dough, 
captured our attention. We oohed 
and aahed. Chocolate chips melted 
within gourmet pastries with choco-
late sauces intricately drizzled atop 
them. “Choco Puppies,” the menu 
read. Sold. 

“We’ll have the Choco Puppies, 

please,” I told the waitress while or-
dering. 

Upon their arrival, silence de-

scended upon our table. In front of us 
sat two minuscule, crusted and cold 
chunks of what looked like literal fe-
cal matter. A singular line of dried-
up chocolate sauce graced a fraction 
of the right chunk. We couldn’t con-
tain ourselves after looking at the 
Choco Puppies, the menu and then 
each other. Our laughter erupted 
throughout the restaurant. Sprawled 
out over the booth at Denny’s, we 
gasped for air, held our stomachs 
and pounded the table. 

Back on my apartment’s couch, my 

friends and I laughed as well. “Tell 
another!” they said. Ah, laughter: the 
gift that keeps on giving. 

***
Above all else, laughter heals my 

spirit every time without fail. It’s 
the medicine of all medicines, pick 
me up of all pick me ups, a remedy 
for my soul more effective than any 
meditation, yoga class or prayer. It’s 
there on the darkest days and ever-
present on the brightest. It’s free and 
it’s easy and it never ever runs out. I 
feed my soul by laughing. Due to my 
love for the activity, I think I laugh 
more than the average person. Like 
fresh juice from an orange, I’m keen 

to squeeze the humor out of any situ-
ation.

But why does this simple action 

heal my spirit and give me a dose of 
euphoria that can’t be found any-
where else?

According to University of Michi-

gan professor Nansook Park, an ex-
pert in positive psychology, there’s a 
definite scientific explanation as to 
why laughing feels so good. 

“When we laugh, physically, it de-

creases the stress hormone, corti-
sol,” Park said. “Laughing out loud 
protects our hearts and relaxes our 
muscles by increasing blood flow. 
Also, it triggers the release of endor-
phins, natural feel-good chemicals, 
which reduce pain and boost our 
mood.” 

In an email interview with The 

Daily, Dina Gohar, another U-M 
professor in the field of positive 
psychology, explained it this way: 
“Laughing forces air out of the lungs 
and causes us to take deep inward 
breaths, which increases the flow 
of oxygen in the body and helps ac-
tivate the parasympathetic nervous 
system,” she wrote. 

Gohar also discussed substantial 

proof of laughter’s long-term health 
benefits. 

“Laughter’s ability to counteract 

the negative effects of stress may be 
why those who laugh more may also 
live longer and experience fewer 
heart attacks as well as less sickness 
since they enjoy better immunity,” 
she explained. “A 2016 15-year Nor-
wegian study found that women with 
strong senses of humor lived longer 
than others. In fact, they were 73% 
less likely to die from heart disease 

and 83% less likely to die from infec-
tion.” 

So that deep belly laugh actually is 

powerful medicine.

Both professors also emphasized 

how laughter promotes social bond-
ing. “Laughter is a social emotion, 
and research suggests we’re about 30 
times more likely to laugh in the pres-
ence of other people, especially those 
we are close with and like than when 
we’re alone,” Dr. Gohar said. Professor 
Park had similar ideas. 

“When we feel good, we are more 

willing to open our hearts and broaden 
our perspectives,” Park said. “When 
we laugh together it’s even better. It 
brings people and teams closer and 
strengthens the bonds between people 
through shared positive experience.” 

It seems that laughter is also a so-

cial tool, as it makes us feel connect-
ed to those around us. 
P

ersonally, I believe the crux of 
laughter’s beauty is its ability 
to brighten any situation, no 

matter how dire, depressing or up-
setting. In fact, I think finding hu-
mor in the depressing, attempting 
to make light of the grim, is essen-
tial for making it through the lows of 
life. In the saddest of situations, just 
the stringing together of a couple of 
witty words can make someone laugh 
and smile as well as lift their spirits. 
For example, a solid joke from my 
roommate about the salmon I burnt 
in the air fryer makes up for the fact 
that we’re completely out of luck 
for dinner. As Dr. Gohar explained, 
“The ability to laugh, whether at life 
itself, yourself, or a good joke, is a 
source of life satisfaction and resil-
ience. Substantial evidence exists for 

the effectiveness of humor as a cop-
ing mechanism. Studies involving 
combat veterans (Hendin & Haas, 
1984), cancer patients (Carver, 1993) 
and surgical patients (Culver et al., 
2002) have found that when humor 
is used to reduce the threatening na-
ture of stressful situations, it is asso-
ciated with resilience and the capac-
ity to tolerate stress (Martin, 2003).”

This information is certainly ap-

plicable to this year, which has been 
notoriously difficult and dishearten-
ing. Nothing is certain or reliable, 
due both to the current political cli-
mate and implications of the pan-
demic. For me, and almost all other 
students, the college experience I’ve 
longed for is completely out of the 
picture. With life as we currently 
know it, we can’t go to classes and 
form relationships with our peers 
and professors. 

Our basketball team is dominating, 

yet we must watch from our sepa-
rate television screens instead of to-
gether in the stands of Crisler Arena. 
A majority of freshmen aren’t in the 
residence halls: We’re spread out 
throughout Ann Arbor or at home, 
navigating our first winter without 
the community and support we prob-
ably need. And as for coping, options 
are limited. Yoga and pilates classes 
are few and far between, mostly on 
screens like everything else. The 
gyms have spiratically been open due 
to county lockdowns, and many in-
person group religious services are 
not happening. It’s difficult to gather 
or connect with others, and for many, 
virtual therapy or counseling can 
present unique challenges. 

It seems that the best medicine 

that’s reliably available right now is 
laughter. In fact, sitcoms like “The 
Office” and “Friends” have skyrock-
eted in popularity. I personally try to 
find a laugh wherever I can. I laugh 
as my friends and I dissect our prior 
nights, I laugh as we relay the bizarre 
events of our Zooms and breakout 
rooms. I laugh at our meal that was 
left at the very end of the driveway 
by the delivery man, cackle about 
the time I tumbled down the stairs 
in front of incoming guests, chuckle 
every time I open my refrigerator to 
the old soup that’s been sitting in its 
Tupperware since my roommates ate 
it in January. We laugh together as we 
analyze life, people and all that we’re 
experiencing, as well as a story from 
my list from time to time. 

Whether it’s the large laughs from 

infamous stories like the Choco Pup-
pies fiasco, or the smaller laughs from 
comments, witty remarks and snow-
balling convos where each addition 
to the discussion adds a new level of 
hysteria, they all come together to 
make my days here more cheerful and 
the current circumstances bearable. 
While this pandemic has prevented 
me from continuing to do a lot of the 
activities I normally do, I’m certainly 
continuing to add to my “Laughing” 
list. I aim for that deep belly laugh, 
that medicine of all medicines and 
joy of all joys. 

Maybe one day soon I’ll secure one 

of those limited spots for a yoga class. 
But for now, I’ll tend to my spirit on 
my couch, with the help of my friends 
and a large dose of laughter.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

After outscoring No. 4 Maryland 6-5 in 

the fourth quarter of its 20-9 loss last week, 
the Michigan men’s lacrosse team picked 
up right where it left off when it faced Johns 
Hopkins on Saturday afternoon.

In 
the 
opening 
quarter, 
the 

Wolverines’ defense clamped down on 
the Blue Jays, forcing five turnovers and 
limiting their offensive unit to only one 
goal. On the offensive end, things were 
firing on all cylinders for Michigan. 
Freshman attackman Michael Boehm 
scored a highlight-reel goal while 
diving into the crease, and sophomore 
midfielders Michael Cosgrove and Jacob 
Jackson notched tallies of their own. By 
the quarter’s end, the Wolverines stood 
tall with a 3-1 lead.

But in the subsequent stanzas — in large 

part due to a myriad of mental gaffes and 
self-induced turnovers — Michigan ceded 
control of the game to Johns Hopkins, and 
the Blue Jays ran away with it on the back 
of attackman Joey Epstein, who netted 
six goals. Outpacing the Wolverines (0-2), 
13-4, in the next three quarters, Johns 
Hopkins (1-1) soared to a 14-7 victory in 
Michigan’s home opener, giving coach 
Peter Milliman his first win with the Blue 
Jays. 

“We had 21 turnovers,” Wolverines’ coach 

Kevin Conry said. “You want to see the 
game, there it is. Twenty-one turnovers. … 

That’s a lot of second-chance opportunities 
(for an opponent). I don’t think we’re in good 
enough shape, defensively, to handle that.”

For a brief portion of the second quarter, 

Michigan stayed the course. In response 
to a rocket inside from Johns Hopkins 
attackman Brendan Grimes, Boehm dodged 
from behind the cage and scored his second 
goal of the day to re-establish the Wolverines’ 
two-goal lead. From there, though, an 
opportunistic Blue Jays’ offense began to 

capitalize on the numerous Michigan errors 
which ensued. 

On the extra-man opportunity following 

a push from Wolverine junior defenseman 
Andrew Darby, a wide-open Epstein fired a 
shot into the top right corner of the net past 
junior goaltender John Kiracofe, cutting 
Michigan’s advantage to one. Epstein’s 
tally was the first of four goals that Johns 
Hopkins would score on man-up throughout 
the contest.

Four minutes later, Epstein rattled off 

a pair of goals within a minute to give the 
Blue Jays their first lead of the day, 5-4.

For the Wolverines, the composure and 

confidence that were so evident during the 
first quarter performance had vanished by 
the midpoint of the second. Desperate to 
keep up with Johns Hopkins as it watched 
its lead slip away, Michigan began to 
force its passes and shots, resulting in six 
turnovers and three failed clears. 

“We’re just not playing well,” Conry 

said. “That’s it. We’re turning the ball over 
consistently. We’re not in good spots. We’re 
not getting the right guys the ball at the 
right time. We have to do a better job, and 
I have to do a better job putting these guys 
in good spots.”

While a buzzer-beating, underhand laser 

from graduate midfielder Avery Myers 
breathed some life into the Wolverines’ 
sideline heading into halftime, it paid no 
dividends, as their woes would carry over 
into the second half as well.

Michigan began the third quarter with 

five consecutive possessions that ended in 
turnovers. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays opened 
the floodgates, piling on six goals to jump 
out to a commanding 12-5 lead. Playing from 
behind against a storied program like Johns 
Hopkins, the Wolverines — particularly 
their underclassmen, who comprise six of 
the 10 starting lineup spots — were visibly 
flustered and struggled to get into any type 
of groove. Sophomore attackman Josh 
Zawada, who recorded an astounding five 
points against Maryland, failed to score 

and racked up three turnovers. With one 
second remaining in the third quarter, 
frustration had seemingly boiled over when 
freshman midfielder Kyle Stephenson hit a 
Blue Jays player and was charged with an 
unnecessary roughness penalty.

 “I love their energy,” Conry said of his 

freshmen and sophomores. “They’re energy 
guys. … (But) just settling those guys down 
is the biggest thing.”

Added Myers: “I think the biggest thing 

for me is just making them understand that, 
although this is Big Ten lacrosse, (although) 
this is Division I, it’s stuff they’ve done 
before. They gotta have confidence in their 
stick skills. They’re here for a reason.”

While Michigan hoped to come away 

with a win against a Johns Hopkins 
program that underwent a coaching 
change this offseason and has fallen off a 
bit in recent years, it was ultimately its own 
worst enemy on Saturday. Missed defensive 
assignments, turnovers and penalties gave 
the Blue Jays too many opportunities to 
take advantage of, and it all proved to be 
too much for the Wolverines’ youth to 
overcome.

But with such an inexperienced roster 

navigating a brutal Big Ten-only schedule 
this season, these growing pains are to be 
expected early on. 

“We have to have patience,” Conry said. 

“We still haven’t seen the best version of 
who we are, and I’m still excited about this 
team. … It’s just, right now, we’re making 
too many mistakes at key moments.

“And that’s what’s killing us.”

Michigan’s struggles in the last five minutes of the first half led to a loss.

In observance of Women’s History 

Month, The Daily’s sports section is 
launching its fourth annual series 
aimed at telling 
the stories of 
female athletes, 
coaches 
and 

teams at the 
University 
from 
the 

perspective 
of the female 
sports writers 
on staff.

Kari Miller 

watched as her shot bounced 
right on the edge of the court, 
then watched again as her 
Ohio State opponent couldn’t 
corral it.

Miller, a freshman on the 

Michigan 
women’s 
tennis 

team, pumped her fists as her 
teammates hounded her. She’d 
just won the tiebreaker at No. 
1 singles, giving her team a 4-3 
upset over the eighth-ranked 
Buckeyes.

It was far from the only 

winning moment this weekend 
you 
may 
have 
missed. 
In 

Minneapolis, three swimmers 
and three relay teams won 
Big 
Ten 
championships 

as 
junior 
Maggie 
MacNeil 

was named Swimmer of the 
Championships for the second 
consecutive year. At the same 
time in Geneva, Ohio, the 
women’s track and field team 
won 
individual 
conference 

titles in the 400-meter dash 
and the pole vault en route to 
a second-place team finish, its 
best since 2016. In Leesburg, 
Fla., softball kicked off its 
season with sweeps of Purdue 
and Iowa. Water polo notched 
three top-15 wins. Earlier this 
week, women’s soccer shut out 
Minnesota despite missing two 
of its top players — both playing 
for the Canadian national team. 

The Wolverines’ women’s 

teams are often overlooked in 
a normal year. This year, with 
a pandemic still raging, teams 
playing out of season and the 
men’s basketball team flirting 
with a top ranking, it’s even 
easier for them to slip under 
the radar.

But that’s not how it should 

be. With every women’s team at 
Michigan either playing right 
now or beginning its season in 
the next few weeks, this year 
provides an opportunity like 
no other: to follow a multitude 
of contending teams, day in and 
day out.

Let 
women’s 
basketball 

coach Kim Barnes Arico tell it: 
“Shout out to all of the women’s 
coaches at the University of 
Michigan. I think part of what 
drew me to this incredible 
university was to have an 
opportunity to work with the 
best and to learn from the best. 
And the University of Michigan 
has some of the greatest female 

coaches in the world, and I get 
to be surrounded by them and 
learn from them every day.”

In almost every women’s 

sport, the Wolverines have a 
reputation as the team no one 
else in the conference wants 
to play. Take, for instance, the 
two teams that share Crisler 
Center with men’s basketball.

The 
women’s 
basketball 

team is one of the only women’s 
teams at Michigan largely 
without a storied history of 
success, but that could change 
this year. If the Wolverines can 
make it to the finals of the Big 
Ten Tournament, get better 
than a 7-seed in the NCAA 
Tournament or advance to the 

Sweet Sixteen, they will notch 
the best season in program 
history. (ESPN bracketologist 
Charlie Creme has Michigan 
as a 5-seed in his latest 
update.) Already this year, 
women’s basketball has hit a 
few smaller milestones: Junior 
forward Naz Hillmon scored 
a program-record 50 points 
against Ohio State and the 
Wolverines beat powerhouse 
Notre Dame for the first time 
in 12 years.

“I think it just really speaks 

to 
the 
character 
and 
the 

maturity and the experience 
of this group,” Barnes Arico 
told The Daily. “We didn’t have 
an opportunity to finish last 
season and go to the NCAA 
Tournament, and COVID hit, 
we were all sent home. And … 
to then have the opportunity to 
come back to campus and try 
to create something incredibly 
special. And they’ve done a 
few things in this season that 
hadn’t been done before in our 
program history. I think that 
just speaks to the commitment 
to the focus and, really, to the 
gratitude.”

Hillmon is a contender for 

National Player of the Year. 
Around 
her, 
juniors 
Amy 

Dilk and Leigha Brown lift 
the rest of the team up. More 
importantly, this is a team 
with chemistry on the court 
and off it.

Despite 
a 
large 
number 

of 
postponements 
and 

cancellations, this looks like 
a team that could make noise 
in March and establish the 
Wolverines’ program as one to 
consistently watch for.

“Michigan’s about winning 

championships, this university 
has won a tremendous amount 
of championships. And it’s 
a 
long 
history, 
with 
the 

exception, probably, of women’s 
basketball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“So that’s always a goal of ours. 
And that’s definitely a goal 
moving forward.” 

Meanwhile, 
women’s 

gymnastics has one of the more 
terrifying 1-2-3 punches in the 

country 
with 
all-arounders 

Natalie Wojcik, Sierra Brooks 
and Gabby Wilson. Wojcik 
— 
the 
2019 
NCAA 
beam 

champion — has four titles 
this season on beam and in 
the all-around and one title 
each on floor and bars. Wilson 
has three floor titles; Brooks 
has two titles on vault and 
one each on beam and the all-
around. 

The team, which is gunning 

for 
its 
seventh-straight 

Big Ten championship, has 
enough difficulty and depth 
that even after counting two 
falls on floor at its Big Five 
meet Saturday, it still finished 
second. If the Wolverines, 
currently ranked No. 5 in the 
country, can find a bit more 
consistency, they are fully 
capable of getting over the 
hump and making the national 
finals.

“We 
definitely 
wanna 

win 
Big 
Tens, 
obviously, 

and then we want to be the 
four on the floor (at NCAA 
Championships),” 
Brooks 

said Saturday. “We know how 
capable we are, we know how 
high of a level we can compete 
at, so we just wanna really 
find our stride and keep going 
with it. Honestly, we had one 
messed up rotation on floor 
today but looking at our other 
three events, they’re amazing 
and we can do so much, so I just 

think we really have big goals. 
We wanna win nationals, we 
wanna do all those amazing 
things.”

Gymnastics and basketball 

aren’t the only programs in 
search 
of 
championships. 

Women’s 
swimming 
and 

diving is ranked No. 11 and 
rounding into form as NCAA 
Championships 
approach. 

Freshman Ziyah Holman, a 
sprinter on the track team, 
has 
been 
a 
contender 
for 

national titles since her first 
meet. Miller, just a freshman, 
looks fully capable of helping 
women’s tennis maintain its 
success even after graduating 
much of its top talent. Water 
polo, ranked No. 6 in the 
country, has four consecutive 
conference titles.

Those 
aren’t 
the 
only 

intriguing storylines, either. 
Women’s 
lacrosse, 
much 

improved from its early days 
after 
becoming 
varsity 
in 

2014, is looking to shake off 
a tough start. Field hockey, 
always a Big Ten and national 
contender, has to wait a bit 
longer to kick off after a few 
postponements but has a team 
loaded 
with 
talent. 
Come 

Mar. 13, rowing finally gets to 
compete again after having its 
2020 season canceled before it 
even began. 

Women’s teams know more 

than anyone that in sports, 
nothing is given. Many of them 
had their sports postponed to 
the spring and waited through 
a long fall not knowing when 
they’d get to compete again. 
Now, they’re all playing at 
the same time, competing for 
airtime.

“In this global pandemic, 

if it’s taught us anything, it’s 
that we need to appreciate the 
moments and really not look 
past the moment and try to be 
the best that we can, in that 
individual moment, because 
we don’t know what tomorrow 
is gonna bring,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And for us, that’s really 
held 
true, 
because 
we’ve 

been put on pause or games 
have been canceled at the last 
minute … so we just hope for an 
opportunity tomorrow.”

Added gymnastics coach Bev 

Plocki after the Big Five meet: 
“We’re grateful for every day 
that we get, even the difficult 
days like today.”

Women’s teams are used 

to being overlooked, and this 
year, COVID-19 has made the 
circumstances even less ideal. 
But the Wolverines’ women’s 
teams are still here — and 
they’re as good as ever.

So 
this 
week, 
if 
you’re 

flipping through the channels 
looking for something to watch, 
tune into one of Michigan’s 
women’s teams. 

You’ll be in for a treat.

With five minutes left in the 

first half of its bout with No. 10 
Maryland, the No. 17 Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team found 
itself leading, 5-4. The game had 
the appearance of a back-and-
forth battle, as the upset-minded 
Wolverines forced the Terrapins 
into sloppy play at various points.

Five 
minutes 
and 
four 

Maryland goals later, though, 
Michigan 
trailed, 
8-4. 
Two 

goals from midfielder Hannah 
Warther and a goal each from 
attackers 
Libby 
May 
and 

Hannah Leubecker turned the 
ranked matchup on its head. 
The Wolverines (0-3) never 
recovered, losing by a final score 
of 12-9. 

“We 
played 
a 
great 
25 

minutes,” 
Michigan 
coach 

Hannah Nielsen said. “We came 
out strong and took a 4-1 lead. 
The problem is that we cracked 
in the last five minutes and dug 
ourselves a hole.”

“Cracked” was a word Nielsen 

used repeatedly when describing 
the Wolverines’ performance 
after Sunday’s game. She used 
it to talk about how, in its first 
three games, they have tended to 
have five to seven minute lapses. 
According to Nielsen, these 
lapses have been characterized 
by unforced errors and critical 
turnovers, which have dug the 
sort of hole that Michigan found 
itself in as Sunday’s halftime 
whistle blew.

The 
Wolverines’ 
lapses 

are problematic for a team’s 
winning chances in general, 
but such blunders are further 
exacerbated when playing a 
team of Maryland’s caliber.

“When you play a team like 

Maryland, you have to be dialed 
in for the whole 60,” Nielsen 
said.

Looking 
further 
into 
the 

details of Sunday’s matchup, 
Nielsen’s point is obvious. Aside 
from the run of goals at the end of 
the first half, the Terrapins also 
dealt rapid damage to Michigan 
with three goals in just over two 
minutes midway through the 
second half. 

Midfielder 
Grace 
Griffin, 

attacker Victoria Hensh and 
Leubecker’s goals came in such 
quick succession that it seemed 
as though Michigan never even 
had a possession. 

This is indicative of the talent 

on Maryland’s roster, the kind 
of talent that can bury excellent 
performances by opponents by 
capitalizing on even the smallest 
series of mistakes.

Michigan junior midfielder 

Kaitlyn Mead had one such 
performance, scoring a hat-trick 
that included the Wolverines’ 
last goal before the Terrapins’ 
second half scoring frenzy. 

“Kaitlyn 
(Mead) 
had 
an 

incredible game today,” Nielsen 
said. “She put the team on her 
back at points.”

Mead’s 
performance 

represented the sort of bright 
spot that teams look for after 
a loss like the one Michigan 
suffered on Sunday. Mead herself 
is focusing on moving forward 
following the team’s third loss in 
three games to start the season.

“This was not the beginning 

of the season we wanted,” 
Mead said. “But Maryland is a 
great team, and all we can do 
is learn from it and come back 
against Rutgers. We need to 
learn from what we did wrong 
and get going. Stick to what we 
usually do.”

It is all well and good for 

a team to focus on moving 
forward after a loss against a 
top-10 opponent like Maryland, 
but if the Wolverines want to 
recover from what was a sloppily 
played game and reach the high 
expectations thrust on them to 
start the season, they need to 
focus on actionable change. 

And 
that’s 
exactly 
what 

Nielsen plans on doing.

“We need to find ways in 

practice to put them in more 
pressure,” Nielsen said. “We 
come out strong, but when the 
other team turns it on, we crack. 
It’s five to seven minutes at the 
end of a 30 minute half that we 
tend to lapse and put ourselves 
in a hole. 

“What we need to work on is 

staying dialed in for a whole 30 
minutes, so we’re not always 
having to play catchup lacrosse.”

‘M’ falls to Maryland in 

ranked matchup

Men’s lacrosse struggles with turnovers as it falls to Johns Hopkins

SportsWednesday: Opportunity comes with 

all Wolverine women playing at once

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico looks to make history this year.

ARIA 
GERSON


‘M’ softball shows two sides in opening weekend

Deadly. Lucky. Cold.

All three words described the No. 17 

Michigan softball team at different times in 

its opening weekend. Pitching carried the 

Wolverines to sweeps against Purdue and 

Iowa, but Illinois capitalized on Michigan’s 

inability to bring home runners to get a 

sweep of its own.

Ultimately, inconsistent run support 

proved to be the Wolverines’ downfall as the 

weekend progressed.

The pitching pulled its weight, notching 

78 strikeouts on the weekend — Purdue 

couldn’t score a run on Michigan, as senior 

Meghan Beaubien and junior Alex Storako 

gave the Boilermakers little to swing at.

Hitting started off strong too, but its 

success dwindled over the course of the 

six games as the Wolverines managed just 

one run in each outing against Illinois on 

Sunday. Those woes could be expected after 

almost a year-long offseason.

“There’s something to be said for having a 

set lineup,” Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

told reporters on Tuesday. “The kids start 

getting in a flow, and having a flow in our 

offensive lineup is certainly, I think, one of 

our biggest challenges. And we just have 

to let them get out on the field and play. 

They’ve got to get their timing back.”

Michigan seemed to have some of its 

timing back, but still stranded 12 runners 

over the first two games. The Wolverines 

managed to get critical offense from junior 

outfielder Lexie Blair and sophomore 

infielder Julia Jimenez. Both batters seemed 

to pick up right where they left off last year.

Iowa fared no better than Purdue when 

the Hawkeyes took on Michigan. Beaubien 

posted her second shutout of the season in 

game one, and game two looked like another 

easy win for the red-hot Wolverines as 

Storako gave the Hawkeyes little room to 

breathe.

Michigan’s bullpen struggled in the next 

game against Iowa, but there are more 

games to sharpen that aspect of its game.

“It’s going to be really hard to rely on two 

pitchers in a six-game weekend,” Hutchins 

said Tuesday. “And largely in a four game 

weekend. … The opportunity’s there for the 

taking.”

But the Wolverines’ couldn’t keep the 

energy going as the weekend progressed. 

Michigan looked like a completely different 

team on Sunday, especially at the plate. 

Facing Illinois, each game would see any 

offense squashed by solid fielding and 

pitching. 

With the first game on the line as the 

Wolverines trailed by one in the seventh 

inning, struggles seemed to quell Michigan’s 

batters. Blair took first on an error and 

Jimenez sacrificed to put her in scoring 

position. However, a groundout put the 

Wolverines against the wall and a strikeout 

sealed their fate.

The same story could be told in the next 

game. Michigan again trailed by one in the 

final inning, when a single and a wild pitch 

put graduate outfielder Thais Gonzalez on 

second. Blair popped one up toward third 

and Illinois snagged it, ending the game and 

sealing the sweep. The team that dominated 

the first half of the weekend went out with a 

whimper to an unranked opponent.

Jimenez said that looking for the pitch 

each batter likes and keeping things simple 

can help with these issues. That simplicity 

helped her drive in four runs on the weekend 

and could help her teammates deliver much-

needed run support.

Michigan showed two sides of the same 

coin this weekend: one that can win any way 

the game is played and another that can’t 

give its pitchers run support. When it came 

down to the pressure of scoring to stay alive, 

the Wolverines folded.

Softball is back, but it’s undetermined 

what the Wolverines will be this year. 

Strengths in pitching were confirmed, 

but hitting created more questions than 

answers.

Ah, March. In the world of college 

basketball, March can be a double-

edged sword full of both promise and 

disappointment. 

For 67 teams, 

it’s a time when 

dreams die. For 

one 
fortunate 

team 
though, 

it’s a time when 

dreams 
are 

realized. 

The 
NCAA 

Tournament is uncompromising in 

both difficulty and duration, meaning 

that few teams are truly cut out to 

make it all the way. Sure, there are 

always bracket-busting upsets and 

so-called Cinderellas that go further 

than anyone could’ve predicted. 

But, in general, there’s always a class 

of true contenders at the top — if 

they don’t make the Final Four, it’s a 

disappointment. 

This year’s version of the Michigan 

men’s basketball team is in the upper 

echelon of that second category. 

At 18-1 overall and on the verge of 

clinching the Big Ten regular-season 

title pending a win over No. 4 Illinois 

on Tuesday night, the second-ranked 

Wolverines look infallible. 

Since returning from a 23-day 

pause, Michigan has allayed any 

doubts 
about 
its 
championship 

potential. Over the last two weeks, 

the 
Wolverines 
have 
beaten 

Wisconsin, Rutgers, Ohio State, Iowa 

and Indiana — all slated to make the 

NCAA Tournament, according to 

ESPN’s Joe Lunardi — by an average 

of 11.6 points. Michigan is running 

roughshod through what is widely 

considered the best conference in 

the country. Take any one of the 

aforementioned five games and 

you see unmatched intensity and 

consistency from the Wolverines. 

On Feb. 14, the Badgers came out 

and punched Michigan in the mouth 

with a barrage of 3-pointers while 

holding the Wolverines to 34% from 

the field. After arguably its worst half 

of the season, Michigan walked back 

to the locker room down by 12. 

For most teams, that’s not a 

great spot to be in. No one told the 

Wolverines that. 

“Our leader, our boss, (Michigan 

coach Juwan Howard) walked in 

clapping his hands,” senior wing 

Isaiah Livers said after the 67-59 win. 

“He’s smiling, talking about, ‘This is 

where we want to be. We’ve been in 

this situation before, not in a game, 

in a practice, a scrimmage. Find some 

way to put yourself in the situation 

again, you’ve already been there.’ 

And we did that exactly. Nobody was 

pointing fingers, nobody was upset.” 

Championship 
mettle 
isn’t 
just 

demonstrated in tight road victories 

like the one against Wisconsin and 

Michigan’s five-point win over the 

Buckeyes eight days ago. It also 

manifests itself in the second half 

of games like Saturday’s, when the 

Wolverines turned a nine-point lead 

against the Hoosiers into 17 within 

the blink of an eye. 

“They just keep coming,” Indiana 

coach Archie Miller told reporters 

after the game. “There’s a reason I 

think Michigan is championship-

good, and I think a lot of people will 

talk about their skill level, and a lot of 

people will talk about their versatility 

and their ball movement and how 

hard they are to guard. I think they’re 

one of the most difficult teams to play 

against on the other end of the floor.”

Michigan is relentless. Regardless 

of the score, the Wolverines never 

seem phased. The energy they bring 

to every sideline keeps the team 

engaged from tip-off to the final 

buzzer. It’s why no double-digit 

halftime lead seems out of reach 

and why a single-digit advantage 

for Michigan snowballs rather than 

shrinks — just ask Fran McCaffrey 

and Iowa. 

“There aren’t many fans, if any 

at all, so you kinda got to bring your 

own energy,” Michigan video analyst 

Jaaron Simmons told the Daily. “We 

go by the motto, ‘For competitors only,’ 

so we have our players competing 

on the floor, but on the bench, we’re 

competing as well. … When we are 

as a unit over on the bench, loud 

and banging on the bleachers and 

stomping on the ground, that brings 

energy to the group that’s on the floor, 

and it’s just part of that competitive 

spirit. We want every advantage.”

The Wolverines rarely, if ever, 

experience scoring droughts or 

prolonged defensive lapses. At the end 

of games, opposing coaches are left 

reconciling defeat with the fact that 

their team — as Rutgers coach Steve 

Pikiell said on Feb. 18 — “played really 

hard from start to finish.” 

“That’s as good a team as I’ve 

played in my five years as a coach in 

this league,” he added. 

And so, while Michigan may have 

lost to Minnesota earlier this season 

with senior guard Eli Brooks out due 

to injury, that game certainly seems 

more a mirage than a blueprint. As 

we’ve seen throughout the season, 

all things being equal, opposing 

teams can’t just beat the Wolverines 

by playing a half, or even 35 minutes, 

of really good basketball. Beating 

Michigan is a 40-minute endeavor.

Advancing through March — with 

the NCAA Tournament being the 

great equalizer that it is — is one of 

the toughest gauntlets to run in all 

of sports, college or pro. Whichever 

two teams are left standing on that 

first Monday night in April will have 

earned their way, standing as the two 

best teams in the country. 

The Wolverines look every bit the 

part.

The Michigan men’s basketball team has looked like one of the best teams in the country as of late.

How the shutdown 

changed Michigan hockey

Through the first 10 games 

of the season, the Michigan 

hockey 
team’s 
performance 

was akin to Jekyll and Hyde. 

After jumping out to a 4-0 start, 

the Wolverines dropped five of 

their last six games heading 

into the Christmas break. 

That inconsistent play could 

have been chalked up to a 

variety of factors. The team 

was 
integrating 
numerous 

freshmen. They were playing 

four games 
in 
seven 
days 

after months of being off. In 

their December series against 

Minnesota, they were missing 

five players at World Juniors. 

Whatever the lingering issues 

were, Michigan clearly figured 

out a solution after the break, 

racing out to a 5-1 start.

But one thing it did not 

deal with in the first half of 

the season was a COVID-19 

shutdown. Now three weeks 

removed 
from 
the 
23-day, 

athletic 
department-wide 

shutdown, the Wolverines are 

still trying to figure out how to 

overcome this hurdle. 

“There’s no doubt about it, 

we’re not the same team right 

now that we were before the 

break,” Michigan coach Mel 

Pearson said. “We’re just not 

as together, and I’m concerned 

about our conditioning.”

Following 
series 
splits 

against both Wisconsin and 

Ohio State, the Wolverines’ 

up-and-down play continued 

this 
past 
weekend 
against 

Arizona State. They throttled 

the Sun Devils 4-1 in the first 

game of the series, controlling 

play from the outset. But the 

following 
night 
— 
despite 

dominating the shot totals — 

they played to a 1-1 draw and 

never led in the contest. 

In the second half as a 

whole, Michigan’s play is still 

encouraging. With an 8-3-1 

record 
since 
the 
break,the 

Wolverines’ wins have come by 

an average margin of victory of 

4.3. Meanwhile, each of their 

losses have come by just one. 

When Michigan is on, it can 

be one of the most dominant 

teams in the country, but it can 

be difficult for a team to be 

firing on all cylinders, all the 

time. The lack of conditioning 

from the 23-day pause can be 

attributed to the latest stretch 

of inconsistent play. 

“When you get tired, and you 

start to break down mentally, 

you’re not as sharp,” Pearson 

said. “I’ve been around this 

game a long time. You can tell 

when your team is in really good 

shape and has that energy.”

Not 
having 
the 
proper 

conditioning is an obstacle the 

Wolverines can overcome, but time 

is quickly running out. The Big Ten 

tournament is set to begin on Mar. 

14. The NCAA tournament kicks 

off two weeks later on Mar. 27. It 

would be shocking for Michigan 

to miss that latter tournament 

entirely; it would be less surprising 

if it can’t sort through their issues 

by that time. 

One potential fix for the 

Wolverines: taking shorter shifts.

“Shift length … that’s one area 

we have to look at real close,” 

Pearson said. “A guy stays out 

for 34 seconds, recovery time is 

a lot less. You start lingering for 

a minute and a half minute, a 

minute 45 seconds, now you’re 

tired, and it takes longer to 

recover between shifts.”

Michigan came out of winter 

break looking like a strong team 

that had solved its problems. 

It wasn’t prepared to go into 

a second break three weeks 

later — especially one where it 

couldn’t practice. 

In a unique season, these 

challenges were not unexpected 

but can be detrimental to a 

team’s championship hopes. For 

Pearson though, his optimism 

overshadows his concerns:

“We’re good. We’re good for 

the stretch run.”

The Michigan hockey team is still looking to recover from the three-week athletic department-wide shutdown.

Who’s got it better than (them)? Arguably no one.

espite a rough start 

in the Big Five meet 

Saturday afternoon, 

the Michigan women’s 

gymnastics team proved its resiliency 

with a strong comeback on Senior Day 

after a poor first event on floor. The 

Wolverines (6-1 overall, 5-1 Big Ten) 

placed second in Saturday’s meet with 

an all-around score of 195.925. 

“It’s senior night and we also had 

Abby Brenner go down (in the floor), 

which was super unfortunate, so 

(Michigan coach Bev Plocki) was like 

‘Do it for them, do it for your seniors, 

do it for Abby Brenner,’ ” sophomore 

Sierra Brooks said. “That’s what kept 

me going, I was like. ‘I want this to be 

an amazing meet for our seniors,’ I 

love them to death, so just go out and 

do your best performances and don’t 

feel bad for yourself, just go out and do 

what we can do.”

Using Plocki’s motivation, 

Michigan was able to have strong 

performances on the rest of their 

events, with season high scores 

of 49.525 on the vault and bars. 

Sophomore Sierra Brooks led the way, 

winning the all-around title, as well as 

vault and beam titles. Iowa (8-1) won 

the meet with a final score of 196.100, 

Penn State (2-8) placed third with 

a score of 195.850 and Rutgers (1-8) 

finished in fourth with a 195.225. 

With three falls on the floor to start 

the meet, Michigan’s plan to get off 

to a hot start with a typically strong 

event fell through quickly. 

“We feel like floor is a really really 

good event for us, even though that 

didn’t show tonight,” Plocki said. “Our 

goal was to come out of the gate strong 

and start off on a great note, and 

obviously our plan got blown up in the 

first rotation.”

Junior Abby Brenner was the first 

of three Wolverines to fall on the 

floor, with a hard landing on her first 

pass that caused an ankle injury and 

halted her routine.Wojcik followed, 

performing an atypical routine, falling 

on her second pass and receiving a low 

score of 9.050. Wilson also ended the 

rotation with a fall on her last pass. 

“Normally we start the meets 

on vault so it was definitely a little 

different starting on floor, we did 

practice it in the gym this week 

though,” Wojcik said. “But we had a 

few uncharacteristic mistakes.”

The Wolverines ended the rotation 

on floor with a 47.500, their lowest 

event score of the season. Meanwhile, 

Rutgers led the second rotation with 

a team score of 48.725 on vault, with 

the Hawkeyes trailing close behind on 

the beam with a team score of 48.525, 

highlighted by a 9.950 from Clair Kaji. 

After the disappointing start on 

floor for Michigan, it recuperated for 

the vault and surged for its season-

high score in the third rotation of 

the night.. Brooks earned an almost 

perfect score of 9.975, and Wojcik and 

Wilson recovered from the previous 

event with strong performances as 

well, scoring a 9.925 and a 9.900, 

respectively. 

“Typically when I’m relaxed in 

the air I can find the landing… and I 

was able to find the landing and I was 

super excited to finally hit the sweet 

spot,” Brooks said. 

Michigan delivered another 

outstanding rotation on bars for the 

fourth rotation of the meet, with 

another season high score of 49.525. 

Wilson, sophomore Nikoletta Koulos, 

Brooks and Wojcik all scored a 

9.900 or higher, and all stuck their 

dismounts. Senior Annie Maxim also 

stepped in for Brenner after her injury, 

getting the opportunity to compete on 

senior night. 

Iowa, meanwhile, ganked on the 

lead it had built in the second rotation 

as the Wolverines bit at its heels. Iowa 

started off shaky with a 49.000 on 

floor and two falls on beam that led 

to a 48.525, but didn’t give Michigan 

a chance to catch up in the end of 

the meet with the Hawkeyes’ strong 

performance on floor in their last 

rotation, closing out with a 49.375. 

The Wolverines ended their meet 

on beam with a score of 48.375, with 

Brooks earning the title for the event 

with a 9.950. Senior Lauren Farley also 

had a good performance for her senior 

night, earning a 9.800. The solid 

performance by Michigan pushed 

them into second place for the meet, 

falling only 0.175 points behind Iowa 

despite the falls early on in the meet, 

showing their resiliency as the meet 

progressed.
