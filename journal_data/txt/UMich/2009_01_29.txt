Weiser, a former
ambassador, says he
can rebuild party
By JACOB SMILOVITZ
Managing News Editor
The challenges facing the next
head of the Michigan Republican
Party appear daunting.
That person must stymie the
tide of Democratic support in the
state following President Barack
Obama's overwhelming vic-
tory among Michigan voters in
November. And that person must
also do that fast enough to give
the GOP a chance to take back the
state's governorship in 2010.
But the University alum now
in position to take the reigns of
the Michigan GOP says he's up to
challenge.
Ambassador Ronald Weiser,
who spent his undergraduate
years at the University before
graduating with honors from
the Business School, approaches
the job with the precision and
straightforwardness of an entre-
preneur.
"It'slike a business thatis being
run really well but isn't making
money - you have to change it,"
Weiser said in a phone interview
last night. "Our profit is wins, and
we haven't had many lately.
"So, we're going to have to

change what we've been saying
and what we've been doing," he
said.
Weiser all but locked up the
chairmanship when former State
Rep. Jack
Hoogendyk
(R-Texas Twp.)
announced
earlier this
week that he
was dropping
his bid for
the position.

Republicans
will officially choose a new chair-
man when they hold their state
convention in Lansing from Feb.
20 to Feb. 21.
In a phone interview lastnight,
Hoogendyk said he felt it was the
right time to leave the race.
"Looking at the landscape of
the whole picture, I just felt that
it was the right thing for me to do,
for myself, for my family and for
the party," he said.
Hoogendyk -said Weiser must
focus on the issues that are the
"hallmarks of the Republican
Party" - limiting the size of gov-
ernment and raining in runaway
spending - if he hopes to revi-
talize the Republican base in the
state.

Seven of the cases
involved students
at the University
By AMY MUNSLOW
Daily StaffReporter
Folowing through with its new
strategy for curbing illegal music
downloading, the Recording Indus-
try Association of America has

dropped pending lawsuits against
seven students at the University.
Charges were also dropped
against students at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte,
North Carolina State University
and Rhode Island College.
Jack Bernard, the University's
assistant general counsel, said he
was glad to hear that the RIAA had
dropped the lawsuits.
"I'm all for it," he said. "(The
RIAA) said they weren't going to

pursue college students anymore,
and it looks like they are sticking to
their statements."
The RIAA has t dropped all of
the cases without prejudice, which
means that the group retains the
right to sue the students at a later
date.
In past cases, immediately after
filing a lawsuit against a Univer-
sity of Michigan student, the RIAA
would issue a subpoena to the Uni-
versity, giving it 30 days to disclose

the individual's identity, Bernard
said.
Throughout the five years of
the RIAA's litigation strategy, the
trade group relied on the Univer-
sity to pass along settlement offers
to students whom it accused of
file-sharing. Students could then
decide whether to settle by pay-
ing fees to RIAA, fight a lawsuit in
court or do nothing in hoping that
it would not sue.

RENOVATING CAMPUS BUlIDINGS

0 Library can now

books into Braille
By A. BRAD SCHWARTZ
Daily StaffReporter
Armed with digital versions
of most of the publications in its
collection, the University Library
has developed new means for the
blind and other disabled persons
to enjoy the fruits it has to offer.
As part of a partnership
between the Google Book Library
Project and University Libraries
to digitize the University's collec-
tion, Google has been scanning
* images of a large majority of the
Libraries' materials to later be
put online and shared with stu-
dents and subscribers around the
globe.
But officials at the Hathi Trust
Digital Library, formerly known
as MBooks, are in the process of

making all those books available
to people whose disabilities had
prevented them from getting the
most out of their library experi-
ences.
"It's like we've given all of
these people a library card," said
Jack Bernard, assistant general
counsel and chair of the Univer-
sity's Council for Disability Con-
cerns.
Bernard said that making
printed books accessible to those
who are unable to use them was
one of the goals of the University
Library's partnership with the
Google Book Project.
"We decided, as part of this
project, that one of the great
things that we could pursue is
making our library immediately
accessible to our patrons with
disabilities by having the books
in a digital forimat," Bernard
said.
Once the books are digitized,

Revamped area will
soon provide
permanent space
for three groups
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporer
For many students at the Uni-
versity, having a class in the
Dennison building can be an
excruciating experience. Howev-
er, a project currently underway
could alleviate some students'
frustration by eliminating some
classrooms from Dennison Hall.
In an interview this week, Pro-
vost Teresa Sullivan said plans
are in the works to renovate the
fourth floor of Dennison and con-
vert the floor into office spaces.
The University's Board of
Regents has not yet approved
the proposal, but if passed, the
renovation will begin as soon as
the semester ends and should be
completed this summer.
The Graham Environmental
Sustainability Institute, the Cen-
ter for Global Health and the Stu-
dent Sustainability Initiative will

all be located in the new office
space. Currently, thethreegroups
arelocatedintemporary orleased
spaces that don't meet their cur-
rent needs, Sullivan said.
"These places have inadequate
space," Sullivansaid, commenting
on a visit to the Student Sustain-
ability Initiative. "It had so many
students mit Ithought we weren't
going to have any oxygen."
Sullivan said the move would,
in the long run, save the Uni-
versity money and improve
student's overall educational
experience.
"It won't hurt the educational
program," she said. "In fact, itwill
make it better because nobody's
going to have to teach or learn on
the fourth floor of Dennison any-
more."
Sullivan added that new class-
rooms at the Ross School of Busi-
ness building, Museum of Art and
North Quad would compensate
for the loss of classrooms at Den-
nison.
"These classrooms are terrible
classrooms; they're flat, they're
not technology-enhanced; they're
noisy," Sullivan said of classrooms
in Dennison. "We can replace

SHUT UP, PLEASE

Living in rooming houses

The anxieties of arriv-
ing on campus for the first
time can he intimidating
for must freshmen, hut
before the a930s, Univer-
sity students had to find a
place to sleep before they
could make new friends.
Modeling German cam-
puses, the first University
president, Henry Tappan,
reasoned that student
housing wasn't necessary
in an effort to save space
for additional classrooms,
so students were forced to
find rooming houses or take
up residence in a fraternity
or sorority on campus.
By the mid-1920s, there
were only 325 women and
no men living in select
University dormitories,
including the Martha
Cook Building, Betsy Bar-

bour House and Couzens
Hall. At the same time,
about 3,000 men and
women lived in Greek
housing. An additional
4,500 men took op resi-
dence in rooming houses,
and another 800 women
lived in approved league
houses.
Soon, then-new Uni-
versity President Clarence
Little and Sociology Prof.
Robert Angell became
concerned aboot the dis-
tracting elements of the
fraternities and rooming
houses.
Little decided to intro-
duce dormitories as a way
to ensure that intellectual
andscial needsawere being
properly met, with profea-
ants "living in" to look after
student activities.

But the plan for resi-
dence halls had a few set-
backs. Landlords lashed.
out, fearing a catastroph-
ic loss of tenants, and
Little had to tread lightly,
knowing that powerful
alumni were loyal Greek
community members.
Eventually, after a
decision by the Board of
Regents and financial
help from alumni, con-
struction of Michigan's
first large dormitory
began. In 1930, the Uni-
versity opened the doors
of the Mosher-Jordan
Residence Hall.
Later, after the Great
Depression ended, a
series of additional resi-
dence halls were con-
structed.

Peanut recall
grows as feds find
problems at plant
The salmonella outbreak
spawned one of the largest ever
product recalls yesterday by a
Georgia peanut plant where federal
inspectors reported finding roach-
es, mold, a leaking roof and other
sanitary problems.
Managers at the Blakely, Ga.
plant owned by Peanut Corp. of
America continued shipping pea-
nut.products even after they were
found to contain salmonella.
Peanut Corp. expanded its recall
yesterday to all peanut products
produced at the plant since Jan.
1, 2007. The company is relatively
small, but its peanut paste is an
. ingredient in hundreds of other
food products, from ice cream, to
Asian-style sauces, to dog biscuits.
A senior lawmaker in Congress
and Georgia's agriculture commis-
sioner called for a criminal investi-
gation of the company, but the Food
and Drug Administration said such
a step is premature while its own
food safety investigation contin-
ues.
More than 500 people have got-
ten sick in the outbreak and at least
eight may have died as a result of
salmonella infection. More than
400 products have already been
recalled. The plant has stopped all
production.

In a surprise development,
Blagojevich has also asked to make

Blagojevich is accused of abus-

Winter storm begins
barrage in Northeast
A destructive winter storm left
more than a million customers
in the dark before barreling into
the Northeast yesterday, delay-
ing flights and turning the morn-
ing rush into the morning slush as
communities braced for the worst.
The storm has been blamed for at
least23 deaths and aglaze of ice and
snow that caused widespread power
failures from the Southern Plains to
the East Coast. Authorities said it
could be a week before some com-

munities have electricity again.
Tree limbs encased in ice tum-
bled onto roads and crashed onto
power lines in hard-hit Arkansas,
Kentucky and Oklahoma on Tues-
day and overnight. In Arkansas
- where ice was 3 inches thick
in some places - people huddled
next to portable heaters and wood-
burning fires as utilities warned
electricity may be out for a week or
more.

The judge boosted defendant
Weusi McGowan's bail from
$250,000 to $1 million after the
Monday incident.
Prosecutor Christopher Lawson
says McGowan was upset because
the judge refused to remove public
defender Jeffrey Martin from the
case.
McGowan had smuggled a bag
of feces into court and spread it on
Martin's hair and face before fling-
ing the excrement at jurors. No
jurors were hit.
McGowan has pleaded not guilty
to kidnapping for robbery, assault
with a deadly weapon and other
counts in connection with a 2007

House passes
economic
stimulus bill

U.S Postmaster Gen. John Potter takes notes on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. yesterday, Jan. 28, 2009, while testifying
before the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee.
Postmaster general: Mail
days may need to be cut

Total mail volume
down 9 billion
from last year
WASHINGTON (AP) - Mas-
sive deficits could force the post
office to cut out one day of mail
delivery, the postmaster general
told Congress yesterday, in asking
lawmakers to lift the requirement
that the agency deliver mail six
days a week.
If the change happens, that
doesn't necessarily mean an end
to Saturday mail delivery. Previ-
ous post office studies have looked
at the possibility of skipping some
other day when mail flow is light,
such as Tuesday.
Faced with dwindling mail
volume and rising.costs, the post
office was $2.8 billion in the red
last year. "If current trends con-
tinue, we could experience a net

loss of $6 billion or more this fis-
cal year," Postmaster General
John E. Potter said in testimony
for a Senate Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs sub-
committee.
Total mail volume was 202 bil-
lion items last year, over 9 billion
less than the year before, the larg-
est single volume drop in history.
And, despite annual rate
increases, Potter said 2009 could
be the first year since 1946 that
the actual amount of money col-
lected by the post office declines.
"It is possible that the cost of
six-day delivery may simply prove
to be unaffordable," Potter said. "I
reluctantly request that Congress
remove the annual appropriation
bill rider, first added in 1983, that
requires the Postal Service to
deliver mail six days each week."
"The ability to suspend deliv-
ery on the lightest delivery days,
for example, could save dollars in

both our delivery and our process-
ing and distribution networks. I
do not make this request lightly,
but I am forced to consider every
option given the severity of our
challenge," Potter said.
That doesn't mean it would
happen right away, he noted, add-
ing that the agency is working to
cut costs and any final decision on
changing delivery would have to
be made by the postal governing
board.
If it did become necessary to
go to five-day delivery, Potter
said, "we would do this by sus-
pending delivery on the lightest
volume days."
The Postal Service raised the
issue of cutting back on days of
service last fall in a study it issued.
At that time the agency said the
six-day rule should be eliminated,
giving the post office, "the flex-
ibility to meet future needs for
delivery frequency.

$819 billion stimulus
package passes with
244-188 vote
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
swift victory for President Barack
Obama, the Democratic-controlled
House approved a historically huge
$819 billion stimulus bill yesterday
night, filled with new spending and
tax cuts at the core of the young
adminstration's revival plan for the
desperately ailing economy.
The vote was 244-188.
"We don't have a moment to
spare,"Obamadeclared attheWhite
House as congressional allies has-
tened to do his bidding in the face of
the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression.
ThevotesentthebilltotheSenate,
where debate is expected to begin
as early as this week on a compan-
ion measure already taking shape.
Democratic leaders have pledged to
have legislation ready for Obama's
signature by mid-February.
A mere eightdays after Inaugura-
tion Day, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said
Tuesday's events heralded a new
era. "The ship of state is difficult to
turn," said the California Democrat.
"But that is what we must do. That is
what President Obama called us to
do in his inaugural address."
With unemployment at its high-
est level in a quarter-century, the
banking industry wobbling despite
the infusion of staggering sums of
bailout money and states strug-
gling with budget crises, Democrats
said the legislation was desperately
needed.
"Another week that we delay is
another 100,000 or more people
unemployed. I don't think we want
that on our consciences," said Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Appropriations Commit-
tee and one of the leading architects
of the legislation.
Republicans said the bill was short
on tax cuts and contained too much
spending, much of it wasteful and
unlikely to help laid-off Americans.
The party's leader, Rep. John
Boehner of Ohio, said the mea-
sure "won't create many jobs, but it
will create plenty of programs and

projects through slow-moving gov-
ernment spending." A GOP alter-
native, comprised almost entirely
of tax cuts, was defeated, 266-170,
moments before the final vote.
On the final vote, the legisla-
tion drew overwhelming support
among Democrats while all but a
few Republicans opposed it.
The White House-backed legisla-
tion includes an estimated $544 in
federal spending and $275 billion
tax cuts for individuals and busi-
nesses.
Included is money for traditional
job-creating programs such as high-
way construction and mass transit
projects. But the measure tickets

Schwarzenegger seeks end
to prison system oversight

a
SACRAMENTOCalif.(AP) -A it
fightoverCalifornia'sprisonhealth a
care system escalated yesterday r
as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ti
sought to throw out an $8 billion
spending plan for inmate medical r
facilities, saying it's illegal and too c
costly. a
Attorney General Jerry Brown a
and Schwarzenegger administra- p
tion officials filed a motion in U.S. d
District Court in San Francisco
asking a judge to stop plans for
seven prison medical facilities.
They also called for the ter-
mination of a court-appointed
receiver overseeing health care
improvements at the state's 33
adult prisons.
"It's time to return the man-
agement of our prisons to the
people who are authorized by
the voters to do that," Brown
said at a press conference.
"What the receiver has become
is a parallel government operat-
ing virtually in secret, not sub-
ject to government scrutiny."
He askedthe court to replace
the receiver with a less-pow-
erful special master until the
state could regain control.
.T t

Thereceiver, J. ClarkKelso, said
e was ready to compromise.
"Let's be clear," Kelso said. "The
tate is just about to authorize ...
rison construction and yet I'm the
only one who's taking scrutiny."
Cost has been at the heart of
long-running legal battle over
nmate health care in California's
dult prisons. A federal court has
uled the quality of care unconsti-
utional.
Subsequent reports have
evealed an inmate who reported
hest pains died of a heart attack
fter waiting eight hours to see
doctor and another who com-
lained for days of stomach pain
lied of acute pancreatitis.

Kelso has proposed the state
sell $8 billion in bonds to build
seven medical facilities to treat
some 10,000 inmates. The repay-
ment costs taxpayers $14 billion
over 25 years.
Kelso wants an immediate $250
million for a down payment.
Schwarzenegger and state law-
makers have recoiled at the cost,
especially as the state faces a $42
billion deficit through June 2010.
"The receiver will never get
that money," Schwarzenegger
said. "That's important to know
because I will not give it to him.
I don't think the controller will
give it to him, and I don't think the
legislators will give it to him."

A greener tint
Letting states set higher standards is the right way to go
iready a week into his first term, President Barack Obama
seems ready to come through on the promises he made
about environmental policies. On Monday, Obama signed
a presidential memorandum allowing California and 13 other states
to implement stricter standards for automobile emissions. This is
in line with efforts Obama outlined in his climate and energy sav-
ing plans. If the states decide to raise their standards, there will be
a reduction in the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which causes
global warming. Though automakers may be uneasy about the
prospect of having to produce more efficient cars, this is a great
way for states to take emissions standards more seriously with-
out having to raise the federal standards. California and the other
states should take this opportunity to lead the country toward
higher standards.

During the Bush administration,
the Environmental Protection Agency
refused to accept California Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's request to raise the
emissions standards for his state. But now
Obama's memorandum calls on the EPA to
review the waiver of emission standards
for California. The state's proposed stan-
dard could reduce up to 30 percent of car-
bon dioxide emissions by 2016 - a healthy
start toward achieving Obama's promised
reduction of emissions by 80 percent in
2050, The new law would give car compa-
nies until 2011 to start producing cars that
abide by the new regulation.
Instead of changing the federal stan-
dard, states will now be able to choose
whether to raise the bar like California
or remain at the same level. This is a good
way to allow certain states to get more seri-
ous about controlling emissions while per-
mitting other states to wait until they're
ready. At the same time, automakers will
have to start producing more efficient cars
in order to satisfy the restrictions in the
other states. Unless they manufacture a
car for each state, they will have to build
all their cars to meet the standards of the

strictest states, possibly accomplishing the
same thing as a federal standard without
the hassle of having to implement one.
Detroit's automakers expressed their
concern about this regulation. But car
companies have no right to complain
because they've stalled on making the
move to stricter standards for years.
Customers want more environmentally
friendly vehicles, and making better cars
is a long-overdue priority for auto makers.
Environmental concerns should be their
focus, and this change in policy regarding
emissions is a necessary nudge. Besides,
moving in a greener direction is Michi-
gan's only hope. The state's econoipic
future is tied to adopting more responsible
environmental policies, and that starts
with the automakers.
Allowing California to move ahead with
better emissions standards is a good way to
begin making the country more green, but
Obama must continue to push for environ-
mentally sound policy in order to reach his
necessary goal of an 80 percent reduction
in emissions by 2050. With any hope, this
new policy will pave the way for the rest of
the country to adopt better standards.

With the state's budget defi-
cit growing exponentially,
some extreme methods
of saving money
have been floating
around the state
legislature. Among
them is the idea
of privatizing they'
University. The
Legislative Com-
mission on Guy- -
eminent Efficiency PATRICK
was charged with
cutting the state's ZABAWA
higher education
budget, and the
fourth suggestion on its list was to cut
the University loose from its annual
$327 million drain on the state budget
and making it a private school.
This possibility obviously has quite
a few hurdles to clear before it can
become reality, the biggest of which
may be the constitutional amendment
required to let the University go. On
the other hand, a private University
of Michigan would also have many
opportunities that a public university
would not. These include offering
more financial aid, giving Michigan
taxpayers a much-needed break and
allowing the University to resume its
preferred policies toward minority
enrollment and same-sex benefits.
One of the biggest concerns about
the University becoming a private
institution is the elimination of its sig-
nificantly discounted in-state tuition
rates offered to state residents. With
60 percent of students at the Uni-
versity paying in-state tuition rates
- and the discount about $23,000
per person per year - this concern is
well-justified. But at the same time,
the increased tuition rates would
enable the University to offer more
generous financial aid options. If the
University were to raise all residents'

tuition to out-of-state levels, it would
obtain more than $504 million in
additional revenue, much more than
the $327 million the University gets
from the state. The additional $187
million could then be used to sub-
stantially subsidize the attendance
costs of low-income students who so
desperately need aid even to pay in-
state tuition rates. The University
currently spends only $184 million
on financial aid.
Discounted tuition rates should be
determined based on who needs them
mostratherthanwho lives inthestate.
The Office of Financial Aid's website
states that the University "does not
have sufficient funds to meet the full
demonstrated financial need of non-
resident students directly." And yet
it does bend over backward to help
residents of Michigan. This system,
in which the University especially
focuses on in-state residents, seems
antiquated. In an era of globaliza-
tion, when students frequently travel
across the country to attend college,
why is the University still focusing
on serving local residents instead of
the local and national communities
equally?
The common justification for this
discrimination is somewhat valid:
Michigan residents pay taxes to the
state that fund the University. But
this doesn't make much sense - why
should taxpayers who aren't attend-
ing the University pay for those who
are? A better system of financing is
one in which the'University charges
equal tuition to all and offers finan-
cial aid based on need, not residen-
cy. This way, the University can be
accessible to those living outside the
state, and taxpayers who have noth-
ing to do with the University won't be
forced to pay for it.
Another benefit of a private Uni-
versity of Michigan would be the end

to discrimination against the LGBT
community and minorities. Separat-
ing itself from the state would allow
the University to also separate itself
from the state's bans on same-sex
benefits and affirmative action at
public institutions. Not only would
the University be able to attract the
best out-of-state students, but it
would again be able to attract LGBT
faculty who may currently feel dis-
suadedcfrom coming to the Univer-
sity because of the ban. At the same

time, the University would be able to
continue its legacy of racial diversity
and be able to take race into account
in its application process. In terms of
reaching out to minority students and
LGBT faculty, the University's status
as a public institution has forced it to
adopt policies against these groups.
The University is stuck in a system
in which it is forced to give priority to
residents of the state instead of treat-
ing all students equally. This struc-
ture also seems to be hindering it
from attractingthe diversity itdesires
for its campus. A private structure for
the University seems to have many
benefits, including the ability for the
University to offer the financial aid
thatstudents need. Inthe end,thefact
that the University is a public institu-
tion is preventing students from com-
ing here, whether they be a minority,
gay or from out-of-state.

The 'date and mate' mentalit

A few days ago while walking down Wash-
ington Street to the public library, I noticed two
young black men coming down the sidewalk
toward me. I hoped they would make room for
me on the narrow, snow-lined sidewalk. As we
squeezed by each other; one of them muttered
something and I heard the word "China-wom-
an." I was a little bit stunned, but kept walking.
When I didn't respond, they shouted at me and
laughed as I hurried away.
It's been several years since I've been the tar-
get of a racist joke or remark. I grew up in Mis-
souri and have heard some pretty nasty things
over the years - "go back to China" is one
that I've heard many times (I am not Chinese).
And yet when people talked about racism at
my high school, discrimination against Asian-
Americans was never mentioned. Discussions
on racism always focused on tensions between
whites and blacks, which in some ways made
sense to me because the racial, social and eco-
nomic injustices suffered by blacks were much
more prevalent in my community. I was made
to feel that I was worrying about pebbles while
boulders were being hurled. And admittedly,
being an African-American in my community
was much more difficult than being an Asian-
American.
But when I went to California for my under-
graduate studies, I discovered the issue of rac-
ism is not really about which minority group
suffers more. Slavery was a horrendous crime,
but so was the internment of thousands of
Japanese Americans during World War II. Is it
really constructive to attempt to rank injustice?
Racism is still racism, no matter how big or
mal, no matter to whom it is directed toward.
The incident on Washington troubles me not
only because of the racist remark but because
of who said it to me. In Missouri, the people

who said racist things to me were white, and
as a result I've always felt a sort of kinship
with other minorities. Other minorities know
what I've gone through - they know what it's
like to be stamped with stereotypes. I felt the
two black men who called me "China-woman"
should know better and should know how
demeaning it is to be subject to racism. Did they
use a slur against me because they've never
thought of racism as something that happens
to other minorities? Or did they just not care?
It's been several years since I've lived in the
Midwest. It's no longer the '80s or '90s, Michi-
gan isn't Missouri, and the United States is
much more diverse than it used to be. But I'm
curious as to whether conversations about race
in Michigan are still only focused on tensions
between whites and blacks. I hope not, because
so many other issues of minority identity are
beginning to work their way into our national
consciousness - gay rights, for example. I think
more dialogue about all forms of discrimina-
tion is necessary.
Not surprisingly, President Obama's election
has meant a lot to me. Finally, we have a nation-
al leader who understands what it's like to be
a minority in America and who's not afraid to
have conversations on tough issues like race
or religion. And while Obama campaigned
to bring change to America, he can't change
this country on his own. Getting beyond the
destructiveness of racism is something that
we all have to work on together. This is change
that I want to believe that America is capable
of, racist remarks from anyone have no place in
this era of hope.

hese days, itseems thatsingles
at colleges are entertaining an
interesting question: Post-
pone sex for com-
mitment or date
and mate? Perhaps
the commitment
bias is creeping in.
After all, our idea
of monogamy more ,
closely resembles a
One Tree Hill epi-
sode than our next-
door neighbor's ROSE
.friends-with-bene- AFRIYIE
fits arrangement.
However, that----- -
selfless, always-
faithful, emotionally-attentive com-
panion may be more common in
Hollywood blockbusters and Disney
fables than at the Michigan Union.
The evidence is in anecdotes and sur-
veys. One anecdote can be noted in
last year's New York Times contest
among college students that asked
them to write in about their love lives.
The editor noted that only three red
roses were exchanged amongst lovers
in the 1200 respondent letters and a
recurring theme was the "no-strings-
attached sexual opportunism of the
hookup culture."
Another example can be found in
the "casual sexual encounter rates"
amongst students in the North-
east United States. A report entitled
"Hookups" in the 2000 edition of The
Journal of Sex Research revealed that
78 percent of the students had experi-
enced sexual activity with a stranger
or a brief acquaintance at least once.
But many of us don't need empiri-
cal data to know that the tide is turn-
ing. However, it's worth exploring
whether the grass is greener on the
non-committal side. Some clues are
offered in a 2007 Michigan State Uni-
versity study "Negotiating a Friends
with Benefits Relationship" that
measured students who identify as

"friends with benefits". The study
confirmed that most college students
have self-identified as this at least
once. Accounting more accurately
for sexual encounters, this survey
included friendly friends as well as
exes who still have sex and "people
who hangout at the same places" who
may not identify as friends.
While the reviews around this
study depicted these relationships
as stressful, the numbers report that
these diverse encounters have varied
outcomes. Twenty-five percent ended
up nixing both the sex and the friend-
ship. About one-third stopped the
sex and remained friends. A slim 10
percent ended up graduating to com-
mitment. The rest (also one-third)
maintained their friends-with-ben-
efits arrangement. Follow-up stud-
ies revealed that students opted into
these relationships because they did
not want a commitment.
What gives with the anti-commit-
ment sentiment? I have a few theo-
ries. Perhaps our generation has been
scared straight by the beat-downs on
Jerry Springer and has seen enough
politicians fall from grace to know
that being unfaithful just isn't worth
the drama. And the best way to pre-
vent infidelity is to not commit.
Further, I would argue that it's not
so much that we don't value commit-
ment. On the contrary, I think that
we hold it to an even higher stan-
dard. For twenty-somethings today,
the statistics about the failed marital
state in America aren't just numeri-
cal, they are personal. We've stood
courtside at enough nasty divorce
hearings. Some of us are the sons and
daughters of mothers who raised us
on their own. And perhaps the best-
kept secret is that some are even the
products of lasting marriages that
reeked of unhappiness.
We know we can do better.
Perhaps we resist commitment in
the short-term because we know we

can do better in the long run. Non-
committal sex may have its upsides
and downsides, but many of us have
learned to separate sexual feelings
from the complex tapestry of emo-
tions that exist in a committed rela-
tionship. And these encounters can
be a means to a larger end. "Sexually,
I learned plenty about what turns
me on," explains writer Tracy Clark-
Flory in an article that appeared at
Salon.com, "In Defense of Casual
Sex." She also states, "By spending
time in uncommitted relationships,
what I wanted in a committed rela-
tionship became clearer."
The ups and
downs of friends
with benefits.
Abstinence-only advocates who
oppose non-committal relationships
have often argued, "There is no con-
dom for the heart." But non-commit-
tal sex does not have a monopoly on
heartbreak, and other factors such
as disrespect and a lack of emotional
support can also give your partner
the blues. Clark-Flory aptly retorts,
"That heartbreak isn't always sexu-
ally transmitted."
In the end, everyone must pave
their own path to the partnership -
sexual or committed - they seek. As
long as respect and consent is a stan-
dard, there are no wrong answers.
Developing the values in yourself that
you seek in others is also important.
That will increase the likelihood that
your sexual relationships will be a
plus factor and not a detractor.

election, he didn't talk much about
the Michigan's faltering economy,
which has been overseen by a Dem-
ocratic governor since 2003.
"You can blame George Bush,"
Weiser said. "But why is Michigan
worse than the other states? Per-
haps it's because we haven't had the
right leadership, the right ideas, the
right directions and the right strat-
egies to turn the state around."
For that very reason, Weiser
said he expects the Republicans to
mount a successful bid to reclaim
the governorship in 2010.
"This is about Michigan," he
said. "Elections coming up in 2010
are not about what's going on in
Washington, it's about what's
goingon in Lansing."
Weiser's candidacy for chair of
the Michigan GOP follows a life of
ventures in both public service and
the private sector.
In 1968 he founded Ann Arbor-
based McKinley Inc. - areal estate
investment company that now
manages more than $2.2 billion in
properties and other assets.
Under his leadership, the com-
pany grew to more than 700
employees nationwide. Weiser
then retired as CEO and Chairman

sador to Slovakia for three and a
half years.

research.
Reubinoff said with more than
16 million people suffering from
neurological diseases, researchers
need to create new stem cell lines
for further testing.
"Most of the current lines are
not suitable for current applica-
tions because they are used from
animals," he said.
The lines extracted from ani-
mals are contaminated with patho-
gens that can cause damage if they
are inserted into humans.
To solve this problem, Reubinoff
developed a laser system to create
new lines using "human feeders,"
which allows researchers to avoid
* having to employ animal products.
Reubinoff talked about apply-
ing stem cell therapy to cure mul-
tiple sclerosis - the leading cause
of neurological disability in young
adults - and age-related macular
degeneration - the leading cause
of blindness in the Western world.
"The idea is to use human
embryonic stem cells as a renew-
able source of pigmented cells
to replenish the malfunctioning
and dying pigmented cells," Reu-
binoff said about curing macular

from an authoritarian government
into a democratic country, and the
experience, he said, would aid him
greatly as GOP chair.
"I do know how to manage
change," he said, referring to Slo-
vakia's transfo'rmation under his
watch. "And that's one of the things
that I think is going to be impor-
tant for our party and the state."
Weiser has been a big donor of
both money and energy to Republi-
can causes at the state and national
levels. He got started in politics
working for former Republican Gov.
John Engler in his first bid for the
governorship. In the 2008 presiden-
tial campaign, he served as anation-
al co-chairman for GOP presidential
candidate John McCain.
Weiser and his wife, Eileen,
who is also a University graduate,
have been major donors to their
alma mater. Last year, a $10 mil-
lion gift to the University's Inter-
national Institute established the
Ronald and Eileen Weiser Center
for Europe and Eurasia, which
encourages students to learn about
and engage with countries in the
region.
Brady Smith, chair of the Uni-
versity's chapter of College Repub-
licans, said he's excited for Weiser
to take over the state party.
"I'm expecting something new
from him - a new direction for the
party," he said. "I think he brings a
lot of energy, aslot of skills and a lot
of qualifications to the table."
Smith said that to get the party
winning elections again, Weiser

Before becoming a top stem cell
researcher, Reubinoff served as
a lieutenant in the Israel Defense
Forces. He graduated from Hebrew
University with a master's degree
in 1989. Interested in developmen-
tal biology, he took a one-year sab-
batical at Monash University in
Australia. There, he discovered
his passion for stem cell research,
and his one-year sabbatical soon
turned into a Ph.D.
Today, Reubinoff is director of
the Human Embryonic Research
Center at the Hadassah Univer-
sity Medical Center in Jerusa-
lem. He has received numerous
awards for his work on human
embryonic stem cells and fertil-
ity research.
In his own research, Reubinoff
said he has found a way to expand
the number of pigmented cells -
which protect a person's retina
from damage by light and excess
oxidation - in a culture.
"This is very important if we
think we will need to develop a
large number of cells for cell ther-
apy," he said.
So far, Reubinoff has only tested
his research on laboratory rats.
One concerned audience member
questioned whether it's safe to
compare test results in rats with
possible results in humans.
"I agree that these animal mod-
els have limitations, and they are
not really an authentic model, but
they are the best models and most

has to focus on getting younger
Republicans involved in the cause.
"We need to re-energize the
youth and make the message, once
again, appealing to the youth," he
said.
Jesse Bernstein, the president
of the Ann Arbor Area Chamber
of Commerce, said that in order
to restart the Michigan economy,
Weiser must not make the state's
struggles a partisan issue.
"What we need in this state is a
modernization of government and
a putting away of ideologies and
unnecessary fighting," Bernstein
said. "We need solutions."
Bernstein, who said he doesn't
personally know Weiser very
well but has worked closely with
McKinley Inc. over the years, said
that while he understands that
Weiser must represent and build
the party, what the state really
needs is "rational thinking, from
both political parties."
Weiser said that as he takes over
the reigns of the GOP, he is ready to
turn around a party in flux, trying
to rediscover its identity and win
elections at the same time.
But he also warns Democrats
who are ready to rest on their
recent victories of a resurgent
Republican constituency when
Michigan residents pick their 48th
governor next year.
"That's why I'm doing this," he
said, when asked about the party's
chances of conquering the state's
governorship in 2010. "I absolutely
believe that can happen."

can't know if therapeutic effects
obtained in these models will hap-
pen in humans as well."
Reubinoff added there is a heavy
load of experimental work that
needs to be done withlarger animals
before making any conclusions.
Coleman - a strong supporter
of Michigan's recently passed
constitutional amendment to
loosen restrictions on embryonic
stem cell testing in Michigan -
engaged in the discussion and
asked Reubinoff about his future
plans.
"Our aim is to approach the
(U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion) here and obtain approval, and
to approach the bodies in Israel
under the Ministry of Health," he
said.
Reubinoff said health adminis-
trations in Israel tend to rely on the
decisions made by the FDA to deter-
mine what clinical trials to approve.
After the lecture, Alfred Taub-
man, founder and chair of the A.
Alfred Taubman Medical Research
Institute, presented Reubinoff
with a plaque to commemorate his
work.
Taubman joked with the audi-
ence about coming from Israel
despite the treacherous snow and
thanked Reubinoff for traveling
halfway across the world to come
speak at the University.
"It makes it abundantly clear
how critical stem cell research is
for science," he said.

RIAA
From Page 1A
The decision to drop the lawsuits
comes on the heels of the RIAA's
announcement in December,
which said that the body is employ-
ing a new strategy to deter illegal
file-sharing. Instead of suing indi-
viduals, the RIAA said they would
partner with Internet service pro-
BOOKS
From Page 1A
with Services for Students with
Disabilities will be able to check
them out from the library, which
means that even though the
books are digital, they will only
be available to one person at a
time.
"Once the book is checked out
to their account, they get an auto-
mated e-mail with a URL to a spe-
cial interface with the text only,"
said Suzanne Chapman, an inter-
face and user testing specialist for
Hathi Trust Digital Library. "Once
they return the book, they lose
access."
The text-onlyversionofthe book
can be read out loud to a student by
screen reader software installed on
the student's computer or a digital
Braille device, typically a bar on a
computer that uses small pins to
scroll Braille text under the stu-
dent's fingertips.
The Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 requires the University
Library to digitize specific books
requested by students, necessitat-
ing a level of advanced planning
and a lead time that John Wilkin,
director of the Hathi Trust Digi-

viders to slow or stop the Internet
access of individuals who infringe
on copyright laws through illegal
file-sharing.
LSA sophomore Erin Breisa-
cher said she stopped download-
ing music illegally after hearing
about the possibility of receiving
a lawsuit, but now that the RIAA
has stopped pursuing lawsuits she
"might start downloading again."
"I think it is going to be a big,
tal Library, described as a "deter-
rent."
"When somebody's doing
research, the problems, the chal-
lenges of getting this stuff into a
format they can use it in are so sig-
nificant that they have to be very
careful and selective about what
things they want to have in that
form," Wilkin said. "There is no.
sense of exploration through the
entire library."
Bernard said the University is
committed to going further than
what is required by law, and he
described the new technology as
being "game-changing for people
who require works in digital for-
mat."
Chapman said that because the
technology is relatively new, it is
taking some time to become widely
accepted, though people are start-
ing to take advantage of it.
"I think we're still trying to
get the word out that this service
exists because the users need to
sign up for it," she said.
The current print digitization
software doesn't have an accom-
modation for describing photo-
graphs or other pictures in a text,
but Bernard said that's an improve-
ment that may come in the future.
"Over time those things will be

deal," LSA junior Amber Clark
said. "A lot of people are going to
download more, especially college
students."
LSA senior Chad Nihranz,
said he thinks more peer-to-peer
downloading sites will come out as
a result of the dropped lawsuits.
"I figure, if there aren't as many
lawsuits they will come out with
more software to allow students to
download more," he said.
added," Bernard said. "We actu-
ally expect that with the birth
of this mass digitization project,
other people won't have to digi-
tize, so they can put their efforts
into making those things that are
not currently accessible, acces-
sible. We're expecting to see lots of
programs develop and grow along
these lines."
Even before its partnership
with the Google Book Project,
increased accessibility has long
been a goal of the University
Library. And the fact that it is
currently being implemented is
something that Bernard describes
as "very exciting."
Right now, the new technol-
ogy is being made available, to
University students and other
universities that are members of
the Committee on Institutional
Cooperation, a group made up of
all Big Ten schools and the Univer-
sity of Chicago that supports each
school's research opportunities
and advances.
Wilkin said other aims of this
project are to keep libraries con-
nected and protect the items in the
library's collection.
"We remain committed to the
long-term preservation of this con-
tent," Wilkin said.

KNOCKED OUT Buckeyes bring out

Frustration mounts
as Michigan drops
road matchup with
rival Buckeyes
By PEEJ PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
With 2:37 left in the Michigan
men's basketball team's matchup
against Ohio State last night, the
Value City Arena scoreboard mal-
functioned. For a moment, the Wol-
verines were down 63-0.
It was just one of those nights.
For the second time this season,
Michigan (4-5 Big Ten, 14-7 over-
all) fell to its archrival, this time in
a 72-54 defeat.
The day started with snow falling
so hard -
Ohio State OHIGTATE 7
canceled
class. The
game would have followed suit, but
the officials were able to make it to
the game.
Once the game started, it got
worse. In the first half, Michigan
had 12 of its season-high 21 turn-
overs.
The Buckeyes (4-4, 14-5) start-
ed the game on a 19-4 run before
Michigan sophomore Manny Har-
ris could notch any of his eventual
team-high 22 points.
"They played tremendous
defense," Michigan coach John
Beilein said through the Athletic
Department. "Ohio State came out
very early and set a tremendous
tone for how they were going to
play. We had trouble with turnovers
early. If you don't know, we are one
of the leaders in the country in not
turning the ball over."
Ohio State's relentless full-court
press was a major contributor to the
Wolverines' excess turnovers.
"When we have attacked full-
court pressure, we've been good
at it and we were very good in the
second half," Beilein said. "Manny
(Harris), who has been doing a
great job of taking care of the ball,
had a tough day handling the ball.
Some of those were unforced and
some of them we threw right to
Ohio State."
Beilein also felt the frustration.
With twenty-four seconds before
halftime, a normally level-headed
Beilein picked up his first techni-
cal foul of the season after arguing
with a referee. Beilein wanted a
charge called on Ohio State sopho-
more forward Dallas Lauderdale.
The second-year Michigan coach
rarely loses his composure, but he

the worst in Cagers

Thrnovers and
missed 3-pointers
haunt Wolverines
Flash back to last year, when
Michigan students stormed
the court after the men's
basketball team upset Ohio State
80-70 in Crisler Arena.
It was the Wolverines' lone
shining moment inJ
a season to forget. JASON
And with just KOHLER
10 wins all of last On Men's
season, at least Basketball
Michigan could
take solace in beating its rival.
Last night in Columbus, the
Wolverines looked like last year's
team - sans the knocking off
Ohio State part.
The ghost of last season came
back to visit Michigan in two
ways last night.
CLANK: Though the Wolver-
ines lead the Big Ten in 3-pointers
made, they are 10th in 3-point
percentage. It doesn't take a rock-
et scientist to figure out Michi-
gan is taking a lot of shots from
behind the arc.
Shot after shot clanked off the
rim for the Wolverines last night.
They hit just seven of their 26
shots from downtown and shot a
season-low 30.6 percent from the
field.
Last season, the Wolverines
were dead last in the conference
in shooting percentage (39.5) and
3-point shooting percentage (31.2).

Michigan's solution to a poor
shooting night was to throw up
more shots. They'll eventually
drop, right? Heading into the
locker room at the half, theteam
had yet to make a 3-point basket.
It has thrived on the deep ball all
season, and frustration began to
build. Michigan coach John Beile-
in was called for his first technical
foul of the season and freshman
guard Zack Novak was ejected in
the last minutes of the game for
elbowing a Buckeye in the face.
Sophomore forward Manny
Harris and redshirt freshman
guard Laval Lucas-Perry knocked
down back-to-back 3-pointers to
start the second stanza. The bot-
tom line, though, is that the team
made just 15 total shots.
The Wolverines often settled
for a deep shot instead of attack-
ing the Buckeyes' 1-2-2 zone.
Michigan needs to diversify its
offensive strategy. Harris and
junior forward DeShawn Sims
were the only Wolverines to push
the ball into the paint, and it's no
surprise that they led the team
in scoring. Also, by attacking
the paint, it will open up better
looks for freshmen sharpshooters
Novak and Stu Douglass around
the arc.
GIVEAWAYS: Harris's offen-
sive spark led to one of his most
productive games all season
with 22 points and 12 rebounds.
But he also had a staggering 10
turnovers, accounting for almost
half of Michigan's season-high 21
turnovers.

To put that into perspective,
the Wolverines have had six
games with less than 10 turnovers
this season.
As a freshman, Harris turned
the ball over more than he dished
out assists. This season, he has
done just the opposite. Last night
though, he looked like the old
Manny.
And as Ohio State snatched the
ball away from the Wolverines
possession after possession, mem-
ories popped into my head of last
season's loss to Central Michigan
when Michigan gave the ball away
23 times.
The Wolverines looked out of
sync handling the ball against the
Buckeyes' full-court press. Sopho-
more guard Kelvin Grady was the
only player who seemed capable
of bringing the ball up the court
without throwing it away, notch-
ing three assists and no turnovers.
At the beginning of the season,
Beilein said he knew last year's
troubles were far from behind
him. He warned that the team
still had work to do after wins
over then-No. 4 UCLA and then-
No. 4 Duke.
He wasn't lying, and the
troubles crept up on his team last
night in Columbus.
The Wolverines fought back
in the second half, but they also
fought back in many games last
season just to fall short. In the
end, a loss is a loss.
If they don't find a way to take
better shots and hold onto the
ball, there will be more.

Freshman Zack Novak was ejected from the game last night after a flagrant foul.

had reason for frustration. Michi-
gan played its worst half of the year,
shooting a season-worst 0-for,11
from 3-point range and scoring a
season-low 18 points. Only three
Michigan players scored in the first
half (Harris, junior DeShawn Sims
and redshirt freshman Laval Lucas-
Perry) while Ohio State poured in
20 points in the paint alone. After
dominating Michigan during their
win on Jan. 17, Buckeye center B.J.
Mullens and Lauderdale went back
to work, combining for 16 points, 10
rebounds and five blocks.
And in the second half, there was
another ugly moment.
With 1:25 left in the game and
Ohio State's Evan Turner at the
line, Michigan forward Zack Novak
tried to box out Buckeye P.J. Hill.
While doing so, he stuck his elbow
into Hill's face, leading to a scuffle
between the two teams. The offi-
cials reviewed the play and called
Novak for a flagrant foul, which
meant an automatic ejection. The
fight was a clear sign of frustration.
"I have to watch it on film, what

exactly happened, before I make
any comment on it," Beilein said.
"But I think it was a box-out with
elbows high and we'll see. If it was
overly aggressive, then we will
learn a valuable lesson."
Aside from the messy finale,
Michigan played far better in the
second frame, equaling Ohio State's
scoring output during that span.
The Wolverines shot the ball better,
too, hitting 7-of-15 from the arc in
the final 20 minutes. But the Buck-
eyes gave Michigan no window,
matching the Wolverines basket for
basket.
Turner controlled the tempo all
night. He scored 24 points using
an array of floaters, spin moves,
crossovers and bank-shots. He also
grabbed five rebounds, dished out
four assists and collected a pair of
steals and blocks.
If Michigan wants to dance in
March, it has to take care of busi-
ness away from Crisler Arena. With
games against three ranked teams
in the next two weeks, tonight was
the perfect opportunity.

Blue's fourth line finds niche.

WILL MOELLE/Dal
Senior Phil Goldberg, an All-American, hits the pommel horse ear ier this season
Chan and Goldberg
shine as co-captains

Different leadership
styles push Blue
past ranked teams
By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
Four years ago, junior David
Chan was leading a platoon as a
lieutenant in the Singapore army.
He didn't even know Michigan
had a men's gymnastics team.
Four years ago, senior Phil
Goldberg walked on to the Michi-
gan men's gymnastics team, con-
stantly wondering if and when
he'd be cut.
Now, they're both All-Amer-
icans. Early last semester, their
teammates elected them co-cap-
tains.
"I guess I was surprised," Gold-
berg said of his selection. "It's a
great honor, honestly."
Neither Wolverine expected
his selection, but both take the job
seriously. They are determined
to do a better job preparing their
team for performance under pres-
sure than previous captains have
done.
Goldberg tends to be more
vocal, while Chan leads by exam-
ple - hitting pommel horse three
days in a row at the 2008 NCAA
Championships, for instance.
In the "setting a good example"
department, Goldberg is no slouch
either, coming back from injury to
anchor the Wolverines' ring team
last year.
Buthittingtheirsets is only part
of the hattie.
"They're listening to the team,
working with the team," senior
Jamie Thompson said of the co-
captains. "They're actually mak-
ing it more of a team than it has
been."
Though many of Chan's team-
mates saw his leadership expe-
rience in the military as a plus,
Chan called leading gymnasts "a
completely different beast."
"In the military ... you could tell
someone to do something and they
would have to do it,"said Chan, who
will turn 24 on March 18. "(With
the gymnastics team), you have to
be able to gain someone's trust and
someone's idea that they will listen
to you, that when you do say some-
thing, they pay attention."
Chan said this year he real-
ized his own spirits could affect

the atmosphere in the gym. Since
then, he's tried to ensure that he
stays upbeat, even if he's having a
bad day.
"If you don't believe it, at least
look it," Chan said. "Sometimes,
if you keep doing something long
enough, you actually believe it in
the end."
Goldberg thought about Michi-
gan's 1999 NCAA Championship
team, whose lore is well known
among the gymnasts, and decided
that the Wolverines had been too
tense in competition.
By encouraging the long work-
outs and tough strength circuits
the team already had in place,
Goldberg hopes to foster a bolder
style among his teammates.
"I want to lead the team in an
aggressive manner in competing,
kind of get rid of that timid style
that's come back to haunt us in the
past," Goldberg said.
Under the new captains, the
Wolverines have seen positive
results. Michigan was ranked No.
6 coming into the season, and it
won the season-opening Windy
City Invitational easily, upsetting
higher-ranked teams like Ohio
State and Illinois. With their two
captains showing nothing but
confidence, the Wolverines calmly
brushed off mistakes and got back
to hitting routines.
And though of the two, only
Goldberg competed against No. 3
Penn State last weekend, the same
effect was apparent. He led off the
meet with a hit on pommel horse,
hit his rings set and helped guide
the Wolverines to an encouraging
comeback attempt thatended just
short of victory.
Last season, Michigan often
allowed teams to jump back into
the competition or retake the lead
on the final two events. At the
intimidating Rec Hall, the Wol-
verines used those final rotations
to push the Nittany Lions to the
brink.
The two captains have made
taken on more responsibility and
paid extra attention to how all
their teammates are doing in the
gym. After the Penn State meet,
Goldberg tacked up individual
comments on each of the week-
ends routines, including his own,
on the team's bulletin board.
"They're both good students,
they're both diligent trainers, and
they got elected forbeing who they
were," Golder said. "I want them
to keep being (themselves)."

Chemistry on the ice
gives Michigan new
level of consistency
By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
It's difficultto describe the Mich-
igan hockey team's fourth line with-
out listing off a handful of cliches.
Hardworking. Positive energy.
Outhustling.
"That's what they're doing in
practice, just working hard, out-
working, and then when they get in
the games, they're outworking all
the lines they're playing against,"
associate head coach Mel Pearson
said.
And it's easy to get tied up with
the same words when describing
.what senior Danny Fardig, junior
Anthony Ciraulo and freshman
Luke Glendening have brought to
the ice the past few weeks.
"We just work hard on working
hard," Glendening said.
That's exactly what the coaching
staff wants out of those three for-
wards. Michigan coach Red Beren-
son uses the fourth line to spark a
sometimes energy-sapped team.
The line is also a critical part of the
Wolverine penalty kill, which is
32-of-34 in its past three series.
Playing on the fourth line doesn't
seem like a role that requires a scor-
ing touch or a knack for stick han-
dling. So why does it matter that
Fardig, Ciraulo and Glendening are
filling those responsibilities?
The three have developed a rap-
port and turned a constantly rotat-
ing line - in terms of who plays and
who's scratched - into a reliable
anchor on Michigan's forward line
chart.
"They're in the lineup because
they're adding something every
time they're on the ice," Berenson
said. "And there's the chemistry
- they've got something to prove,
they don't play on the power play
(and) they don't get premium ice
time on this team.
"But when they play, they play
hard, and they add something to
our team."

Senior Danny Fardig has seven points in 181 games and has heen a strong member at the Wolverines' penalty-killing unit this year.

two weekends ago, the fourth line
often changed on a nightly basis.
Those who were in the line's rota-
tion, including the three currently
on the line, often got just one night
ofplayingtimeinatwo-gameseries.
But when sophomore second-line
center Matt Rust was a last-minute
scratch due to sickness before the
Saturday night game against the
Falcons, Ciraulo was added to the
lineup and something clicked.
Ciraulo's line set up the game's
only goal midway through the
second to salvage a split for the
Wolverines against the CCHA
basement dweller. As a result, the
trio played in both games against
Michigan State and will likely play
in each contest against No. 1 Notre
Dame this weekend.
"Those are the guys that are
taking advantage and are helping
push other players," Berenson said.
"We've got pretty good players not
even dressing because these guys

goal in the GLI and he looked good,
and now we've given him another
look and he's taking advantage of
it."
Fardig, winding down the last
few months of his Wolverine
career, is playing some of his best
hockey, according to Berenson and
Pearson.
And Glendening,the youngest of
the three by more than two years,
is providing a combination of quick-
ness and strength to the line.
"That's why having a younger
guy like Luke - who works so hard
- is fun for an older guy like me,"
Fardig said. "He's young and full
of energy and just tries to push you
everyday."
And that's exactly what the
fourth line does best for the Wol-
verines.
"You get certain guys who just
want to work hard and that's what
we want, just (to) outwork every-
body," Fardig said.

are working so hard and they're
helping our team win."
Prior to the Great Lakes Invita-
tional in late December, Ciraulo saw
action in just two games.
"Ciraulo has been the odd -man

Basketball community loses legend in Yow

Borseth and
Merchant reflect on
a great loss for
women's sports
By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
For most coaches, 700 victo-
ries would be the thing crowning
achievement of his or her career.
But North-Carolina State coach
Kay Yow wasn't most coaches.
Instead, she will be remembered
for her competitive nature on the
court and her mild manner off it.
She will be remembered for her
integrity, class and unwavering
happiness for others' success
just as much as when she had
success herself.
She will be remembered for

0

giving breast cancer hell for 22
long years, rather than falling vic-
tim to it.
Last Saturday, women's college
basketball lost a legend when Yow,
66, lost her battle with cancer.
"She's one of the original coach-
es that started the game of wom-
en's basketball," Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth said. "She was in on
the ground floor."
Yow was a fierce and fearless
leader on the sideline, accumu-
lating 737 wins over her 38-year
coaching run. She was among the
pioneers who helped bring wom-
en's college basketball to the fore-
front of NCAA athletics.
"She started coaching when
maybe 10 people came to the
game," Michigan State women's
basketball coach Suzy Merchant
said. "We played a game against
Wisconsin on Sunday that had
10,000 people at the game. What

she did was pave the way for these
young girls today to play in front of
crowds like that."
In her 34 years at the helm for
the Lady Wolfpack, she defined
herself as a coach and mentor. She
is one of just six Division-I women's
basketball coaches to have amassed
more than 700 victories,joiningthe
impressive ranks of Connecticut
coach Geno Auriemma and Ten-
nessee coach Pat Summitt.
Yow's teams received bids to 20
of 27 NCAA Tournaments, making
it to the Final Four in 1998. And
she is the only coach who has won
a gold medal at both the Olympic
Gaines (1988) and the FIBA World
Championships (1986).
"She's obviously a legend and
an icon," Borseth said. "That goes
without saying."
Fifteen of her former players
went on to coach or play in the
WNBA, and in 2002, her accom-
plishients were recognized
when Yow became just the fifth
female to be inducted into the
Naismith Memorial Basketball
Hall of Fame.
Off the court, Yow raised
money and awareness forbreast
cancerby starting the Kay Yow/
WBCA Cancer Fund. The char-
ity raises money in conjunction
with The V Foundation for Can-
cer Research started in 1993 to
honor former North Carolina

State men's basketball coach Jim
Valvano, who passed away from
cancer in 1993.
Through Yow's lengthy cam-
paign against breast cancer, she
taught her players the importance
of resilience and strength.
"You think your minor knee
injury is a problem," Merchant
said. "You think your back hurts.
You think your ankle is bothering
you. But Kay had poison and che-
motherapy in her system and came
out and had energy and enthu-

The release of getting out of class
for break can bring out the reck-
lessness in all of us. While spring
break can provide some excellent
opportunities to get loose, make
sure to proceed with some degree
of caution.
After 36 hours of stimulant-
fueled computer programming and
.paper writing, escaping to the fro-
zen wasteland of Indiana for spring
break seemed like a good idea last
year. On the other hand, waiting
until the last minute to finish two
computer science projects and a bio
paper before break was probably a
bad idea to begin with.
But as the hours creeped closer
to spring break, my mission was
clear: I had to finish these projects,
get to Bloomington and decimate
my liver and lungs.
I guess that's howI ended up try-
ing to write my paper on the MSA
Airbus and email it to my GSI from
the airport terminal. A few frantic
phone calls later, I even got one of
my friends to put a hard copy in
the instructor's drop box. Things
seemed fine.
One delayed flight later, I found
myself stuck in Chicago's Mid-
way Airport because the connect-
ing flight, the one the airport had
sworn I wouldn't miss, had left. I
did manage to nap for an hour or
two on the floor of the terminal,
and in my exhausted state, it was
simply bliss. Eventually I made it
to the Indianapolis airport. My
friends from home picked me up,
and we made our way through the
fields of snow and ice and arrived in
Bloomington.
When we got there, the chal-
lenges we faced were immediately
apparent. Every inch of the ground
was covered in ice, and even a short

walk was definitively dangerous.
But we were determined; we had
to party. What else is there to do in
Indiana? After assembling a crew
and appropriately altering our con-
sciousness, we gathered far more
alcohol than necessary and headed
to a random party a couple miles
away.
So naturally, we got trashed.
Despite my repeated observations
that drinking two 40s of Steel
Reserve makes me black out, I did
it anyway and never looked back. A
few shots later, I was in rare - and
extremely compromised, - form.
From what I remember, getting to
see my extended crew from high
school was great, and the party was
worthwhile.
At some point during the night,
things started to go downhill. I
tried to . steal my ex-girlfriend's
phone and generally acted bellig-
erently. Apparently, I also puked
over a balcony railing, showering
my vomit all over somebody's bike
seat. Worse yet, some partied-out
dude apparently put his hand in
the vomit and proceeded to eat a
few handfuls, though I can't really
be blamed for that, and I'm not too
upset that I don't really remember
that part.
I woke up the next morning in
an awkward position on a strange
couch, with some vomit (presum-
ably mine, but who knows) caked
on my sweatshirt. Of course, my
head hurt like hell, I was ridicu-
lously sore, and I had a number
of bruises on my arms and legs.
Although nobody could specifi-
cally remember, I'm sure stumbling
across a mile of ice had something
to do with it. At least I didn't eat any
vomit.

ROAD TRIP ESSENTIALS
If you're saving money this spring break by road-tripping,
you should probably keep the next few items handy. You never
know what you may need along the way.
MAP
You need this to figure out how to get off the highway so
you can make fast-food dives and get back on the road without
winding up in Nowhereland.
MP3 PLAYER AND MIX CDS
There's nothing b'etter than howling renditions of Warren
Zevon's "Werewolves of London" to keep you awake during a
10-plus hour car ride.
CAMERA
So you can take pictures of your travel mates while they're
sleeping and drooling all over themselves. A picture like that
could buy you a free dinner sometime.
ADVIL
You might get a headache after arguing about whether or
not to stop by the creationist museum or the "Touchdown
Jesus" on your way to your destination. It's best to be safe and
keep a bottle around.
SNACKS
The food triangle of road trip nutritionbegins with starches
(Teddy Grahams, Wheat Thins), then goes to fruit of the grab-
in-your-hand sort (grapes, apricots, blueberries), and finally
to sugars (sour gummy Life Savers and Starburst jellybeans).

Breaking the habit in 2009

A look at the more exotic spring
break options offered this year
through the 'U' and other programs
By BEN VANWAGONER
Daily Arts Writer
College can be a terrible drag. It can also become over-
whelming, especially when you're struggling to learn how to
calculate the present value of assets, running linear regres-
sions on Chinese arms trade data or conducting grinding
research on hallucinogenic chemicals. Don't think an occa-
sional game of racquetball will be the panacea to the deso-
late wastes of academia either - no short-lived distraction is
going to save you from the realities of class. The sickness can
become so dire that, even during spring break, students can
do nothing but huddle, fearful, in dorms or apartments across
campus. Even if you don't meet this description, you probably
know someone who does. Not only is this submission to fear a
huge mistake, it's just unnecessary.
Thankfully, the University is a force for good as well as
occasional evil, and there are a couple programs either run
by the University or affiliated with it that offer spring break
options allowing students to be both adventurous and socially
productive.
Q Outdoor Adventures is one such program. Part of the
Recreational Sports program, OA has the goal of providing
students with the resources and guidance they need to get
outdoors for a little longer than the 10-minute walk to class.
OA runs a rock wall, a well-stocked rental center complete
with tents and snowshoes and also organizes adventure trips.
This spring break, they're sending out three groups: one to Big
Bend National Park in Texas to hike in a desert basin, one to
the Florida Everglades for sea kayaking and a third to Costa
Rica. According to LSA sophomore Lauren Davies, who man-
ages the trip programs, all but the Costa Rica trip have been
filled, and that closes Monday.
The programs are appropriately adventurous: The Costa
Rica trip sets students river rafting, rappelling down water-
falls and backpacking through cloud forests - the ambitious
student's spring break, so to speak. For everyone who just
hunkers down over break and for those who complain about
walking through the snow on the Diag, these trips should be
mandatory. Their spirit of exploration is motivated by the
spirit of the OA staff, according to Davies.
"All the staff has a huge passion for being outside," said
Davies. "Trip leaders try to pass on their skills and that pas-
sion."
Although not run by the University, Alternative Spring
Break has become something of an institution. It's somewhat
less adventurous, but it has built a strong reputation by appeal-
ing to the selfless spirit on which the University of Michigan
student body has historically prided itself.
ASB is hardly the campus's.best-kept secret, but the scope
and the real personal value of the program may be. ASB sends
out teams of ambitious, benevolent students to 35 different.
sites each year, mostly in large cities and all within the United
States. The projects are easy to associate with tame, familiar
church group trips, but according to members, ASB offers alot
more variety and perhaps much greater depth of experience.
ASB offers students an option to change people's lives,
according to School of Education senior David Metler. Metler
visited St. Louis with ASB last year and will return this year as
a site leader in Detroit.
"Seven out of the i4 of us (who went to St. Louis last year)
became site leaders this year," he said. To Metler, this is a sign

that people are motivated by their experience. "It nurtures
the spirit of service that is inextricably tied to being a demo-
cratic citizen."
But it's not all roses. ASB has been accused of invading
communities, spending a comforting week of comparatively
effortless pseudo-service and leaving with falsely assured
consciences onlyto finally return to a fully and carefully sepa-
rated existence. According to LSA senior and ASB leadership
team member Sarah Crane, that's exactly what ASB tries to
avoid.
"We aim for empowerment," she said. "We come into these
communities asking'What resources do you have? Where can
we be of help?"'

The goal, she said, is not to show off how much students can
do, but to emphasize the ability of communities to enact their
own change. ASB tries to play to the strengths of the site.
"It's an asset-based approach rather than a need-based
approach," Crane said.
Though two very different programs, the ultimate goal is
similar.
"It leads to future passion," Metler said of ASB. Outdoor
Adventures, too, offers students an opportunity to learn a bit
more abouttheir own abilities and build an adventurous spirit
outside of that "Hey, let's go to the CCRB!" attitude.
Whatever the case, both options are certainly better than
just sitting around moping about exams.

S G A S T

My eniorsring break was one
marked by high culture and severe
indigestion. While most of my fel-
low colleagues ventured to the
Bahamas for beautiful weather
and mass consumption of alcohol,
I went with three of my friends to
Paris and London for the awful
weather and the mass consump-
tionof alcohol cnum.
In Paris, our jet lag quickly ;
evolved into insomnia. We stayedc
up all night (literally) playing
Scrabble, rhyming and watchinge
anime on mute while listening to
Pink Floyd. It was seriously onet
of the greatestnights of my life. a
The next afternoon, on the other r
hand, was brutal. A Botox-faced o
tourguide led us around town to a
multitude of creepy chapels while a.
it stormed violently outside. Sleep tn
deprivation combined with cul- ve
tore shock made me feel like I was u
either in Hell or aD a i was
movie. If we were avd Lynch p1
intelligent beings, we would've an
learned from our exhaustion and
gone to bed that night at a reason- ,

able hour. But we weren't, and
we proceeded to follow the same
exact routine for the next four
nights.
Then came London, and it was
time to drink. We went to an actu-
al pub and drank actual Guinness
from an actual taps Itwas wonder-
ful-until later that night in our
hotel room, when I was hit with
a double-whammy of fever and
diarrhea. My friends ordered beer
from room service and alternat-
ed jumping on the king-size bed
and writing down their drunken
houghts. I alternated between
hitting my guts out in the bath-
oom and attempting to pass out
n the pullout sofa.
Of course, my friends and I hit
ill the standard cultural check-
iarks of eating crepes from local
endors, visiting surreal art muse-

ays. But, honestly, what match

'1-20 Mayar'

After listening to a 12-inch vinyl LP
of Paul Simon's Graceland on a record
player in my room last year, my friends
and I conceived the plan to visit the
actual Graceland in Memphis, just
like Paul Simon had before recording
his now-famous album.
We passed the cramped, 16-hour
drive by eating pretzels and Clemen-
tines while listening to mix tapes we'd
made with selections like Billy Bragg
& Wilco's "California Stars," The
Talking Heads' "Once in a Lifetime,"
and, of course, the album Graceland in
its entirety.
The main attraction of the trip was
the 13-acre Elvis Presley estate after
which Simon's song and album were
named. I had never really been inter-
ested in Elvis, save for listening to
the compilation album ELVIS when
I was 13. Although I had little knowl-
edge about the life of rock'n'roll's first
star, I expected to see overwhelming
amounts of rhinestoned kitsch at the
estate. But I didn't know quite how
much until we got there.
Sure enough, the mansion wasfilled
with all the flamboyant decadence
you'd expect from a pompadoured
rock star living in the 1960s and '70s.
There was a jungle room covere d

in green shag carpeting and plastic
jungle vines, a TV room equipped
with six televisions and a martini bar
in the corner, and a barn for Elvis's
horse Rising Sun that he unoriginally
dubbed "House of the Rising Sun."
At the end of the tour was the Pres-
ley family grave. Elvis's grave was
covered in flowers sent from music
lovers in Tokyo and Spain. After acres
of Elvis's surreal life story, mapped
out in the form of gem-studded jump-
suits and walls covered in gold and
platinum records, it was strange to
realize that this music icon had been
real flesh and blood, especially after I
grew up seeing his face immortalized
on postage stamps; and after listening
to his home immortalized in Simon's
songs.
We stood there, and while none
of us had put down our cameras for
a second while documenting the
strange house and its kitschy atmo-
