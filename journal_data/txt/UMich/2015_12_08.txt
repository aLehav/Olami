Ethics board 

investigated Jesse 
Arm for conduct at 
Diag demonstration

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

In a report released Monday, 

the Central Student Government 
Ethics Commission recommended 
that the full assembly take no action 
toward CSG Rep. Jesse Arm, an LSA 
sophomore whose conduct at a Diag 
demonstration last month generated 
criticism from members of the group 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Democracy.

The 
report, 
which 
will 
be 

considered by CSG on Tuesday, 
details the findings of what is 
likely the commission’s first ethics 
investigation.

Public Policy junior Thomas 

Hislop, chair of the CSG Ethics 
Committee, said the assembly can 
adopt the recommendation with a 
majority vote.

In the report, the committee 

said their recommendation resulted 
from the testimonies of all involved 
parties and a review of a video of 
the scene recorded by SAFE. Citing 

Article VIII of the Student Body 
Constitution, the report concludes 
each party had equal rights both in 
the demonstration and the display of 
grievances.

“Representative Arm did not 

engage in unethical behavior or 
engage in conduct unbecoming of a 
representative,” the report stated. 
“Just as the SAFE had the right to 
peacefully assemble in the Diag, 
Representative Jesse Arm had the 
right to voice his opinion.”

According to the report, such 

an investigation had no precedent, 
as no records of previous ethics 
investigations were identified during 
the process.

“The Rules Committee Chairman, 

(Rackham student Jared Ferguson), 
informed me that this is the first 
ethics committee hearing that CSG 
has had that he is aware of,” Hislop 
said.

The report said having the 

committee move forward with 
an ethics investigation initially 
seemed appropriate given the video 
evidence, though ultimately the 
committee questioned whether the 
actions called for an investigation. 
Arm said earlier this month that he 
was particularly surprised to hear 
the incident would result in an ethics 
investigation.

Monday’s Ann Arbor City 

Council meeting largely con-
cerned organizational matters 
for 2016, as the council amend-
ed and approved the 2016 coun-
cil rules and council calendar.

The council also signed off 

on new committee assignments 
for the upcoming year, which 
included placements for the 
body’s two new members.

Recently elected Council-

member Zach Ackerman (D–
Ward 3), an LSA senior, will be 
added to six committees. These 
include the Ann Arbor Sum-
mer Festival Liaison, the Audit 
Committee, the Board of Insur-
ance Administration, Housing 
and Human Services Advisory 
Committee and the Park Advi-
sory Commission.

Recently elected Council-

member Chip Smith (D–Ward 
5) was appointed to five com-
mittees, including the Brown-
field Plan Review Committee, 
Budget and Labor Committee, 
the Energy Commission, the 
Environmental 
Commission 

and the Liquor Control Com-
mission.

The council also approved 

the Rules of Council for 2016 
— a set of standard operating 
procedures for council-relat-
ed business. Councilmember 
Sabra Briere (D–Ward 1) said 
the Council Rules Committee 
brought forth three compo-
nents: the set of rules, ethics 
standards and a code of conduct 
for interactions between city 
staff and council.

“One of the side effects of 

establishing the ethics policies 
is how we clarify our role in 
this organization,” Briere said. 
“That’s what we’ve all been 
talking about for a couple of 
years and it’s my hope that we 
have come up with three pieces 
of the puzzle that work for us 
all.”

The five new ethics standards 

included outlining appropriate 
communications between coun-
cil members and city staff. The 
new standard states that coun-
cil members may not directly 
give direction to city staff, but 
instead must speak to the city 
administrator, who will then 
delegate work to staff.

Briere said the ethics rule 

was added because city staff 
have been compromising their 
responsibilities by accepting the 
demands of council members.

applies business 
perspective in 
shaping policy

Daily Staff Reporter

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, 

a University alum, returned 
to Ann Arbor on Monday to 
speak with a group of Business 
sophomores 
about 
ongoing 

revitalization efforts in Detroit.

Duggan, who graduated from 

the University’s Law School in 

1983, was not new to Detroit 
politics when he assumed the 
mayor’s office in 2014. From 
1987 to 2001, he served as 
Wayne County’s deputy county 
executive, 
and 
prosecutor 

from 2001 until 2003. In 2004, 
he became the president and 
CEO of the Detroit Medical 
Center, where he remained until 
December 2012.

Duggan said one of the pillars 

of his campaign was to make 
policymaking in the city a more 
inclusive process.

“I finished every speech the 

same way,” he said. “I said if 
I’m the mayor, if you’re going 
to vote for me, the ‘us versus 

them’ politics is over. It’s no 
longer going to matter if you’re 
Black, brown or white. It’s 
not going to matter if you’re 
Christian, Jewish or Muslim. 
It’s not going to matter if you’re 
gay or straight. It’s not going 
to matter if you were born in 
the city of Detroit or you’re 
an immigrant from another 
country. We’re going to build a 
city where everyone is welcome 
and everyone is included.”

Since becoming the city’s 

mayor in January 2014, the city 
has experienced a number of 
changes. Five months before 
he assumed office, the city 
of Detroit filed for Chapter 

9 bankruptcy. The following 
November, 
Judge 
Steven 

Rhodes approved Detroit’s plan 
of adjustment.

Now that the city has emerged 

from bankruptcy, Duggan said 
he is pursuing a number of 
initiatives to improve the city.

Over the past year, the city has 

installed 58,000 new streetlights 
in Detroit to fix the city’s public 
lighting problem. According to 
Duggan, the new LED lights 
have been installed every 300 
feet so that most blocks have a 
light on each corner and in the 
middle of the block.

Business graduate 

students gather 

$5K after heaviest 
rain in 114 years

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Two graduate students in 

the Ross School of Business, 
Sneha 
Venkatachalam 
and 

Preetha Lakshmi Narayanan, 
are working to raise money for 

Chennai, India, a city facing 
the highest rainfall it has seen 
in 114 years.

After the flooding started a 

few days ago, Venkatachalam 
and 
Lakshmi 
Narayanan 

brainstormed ways they could 
help the people of Chennai. 
The pair both wanted to 
provide immediate assistance 
to 
those 
affected 
by 
the 

heavy rainfall as well as find 
resources to help with the 
aftermath and damages of the 
resulting flooding.

Chennai is the capital of 

the Indian state of Tamil 
Nadu, which is located in 
southeast India. Since heavy 
rains began in the state, the 
army has needed to rescue 
5,000 people, and many lack 
food and drinking water. Cell 
service and electricity have 
also been knocked out by 
storms, backing rescue efforts 
particularly difficult.

“Something needs to be 

done, 
firstly 
because 
it’s 

raining now and it’s getting 
worse,” Lakshmi Narayanan

Five-day symposium 

considers impact 
of sugar in shaping 
gender identities

By RACHEL COHEN

For the Daily

On Monday, several University 

units 
kicked 
off 
a 
five-day 

symposium that will touch on 
concepts 
including 
tourism, 

commercialism 
and 
gender 

identities — all through the history 
of sugar in the Caribbean.

Gaiutra Bahadur, an author and 

journalist whose work has been 
featured in The New York Times 
Book Review, The Washington 
Post Book World, Foreign Policy 
Magazine 
and 
The 
Nation, 

delivered 
a 
keynote 
address 

Monday on the experiences of 
indentured Indian women who 
immigrated to the Caribbean.

The idea for the symposium 

originated with Anita Gonzalez, 
a University professor who heads 
the Global Theatre and Ethnic 
Studies minor in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance. She had 
been working with her colleagues 
on a performance project designed 
to consider how involuntary labor 
by people of color could provide 
a mechanism for understanding 
the Caribbean more broadly. The 
project would eventually form the

Adele Goldberg is a junior 
in the Ford School of 
Public Policy. Goldberg is 
interested in policy related 
to homelessness and is 
involved in Alternative 
Spring Break and K-grams 
on campus. She also 
coaches crossfit in her 
spare time.

How did you become 
so passionate about 
homelessness policy?

I grew up in Philadelphia, 
and I quickly realized 
what privilege was and 
began comparing myself 
to other residents of my 
city that had nothing. At 7 
years old, I didn’t exactly 
know how to help aside 
from giving leftover food 

to the people on the street, 
or volunteering to package 
food and donate it to the 
homeless. I knew that I 
wanted to dedicate my life 
to learning more about 
how to better help this 
population, and Ford gave 
me that opportunity.

Why did you decide 
to do the Alternative 

Spring Break Program in 

Detroit?

I saw this amazing 
opportunity to actually 
work with people in a 
homeless shelter. I was 
able to work one on one 
with administration in 
Cass Community Social 
Services and talk to all 
of the people that were 

benefitting from these 
services. It never crossed 
my mind to spend time in 
(Puerto Vallarta) or Las 
Vegas. I knew this would 
be life changing.

What else are you 

involved in on campus?

I am also involved in 
K-Grams, which is a pen 
pal organization in which 
you voluntarily sign up 
to become a pen pal with 
youth in elementary 
schools in the Ann Arbor 
area to help promote 
healthy and strong 
community relationships 
that extend beyond their 
classrooms.

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor expresses his gratitude to his fellow City Council members at Larcom City Hall on Monday.

one’s work day, we have liter-
ally interrupted someone’s work 
flow,” Briere said.

On Monday, the council also 

approved a resolution to oppose 
Michigan 
House 
Bill 
4425, 

which aims to amend the Michi-
gan Vehicle Code. Under the 
proposed amendment, a legal 
speed limit under the Michigan 
Vehicle Code would have to be 
set at the 85th percentile speed 
of free-flowing traffic. This esti-
mate would be under ideal road 
and weather conditions, and 
rounded to the nearest multiple 
of five miles per hour. The bill, if 
approved by the Michigan House 
of Representatives, would remove 
the ability for local governments 
to determine some speed limits 
within the city.

“It’s very important for us to 

be able to maintain that local 
control,” Smith said. “This is one 

of those issues where I think this 
isn’t necessarily shouting into the 
wind, this is right now a bill that’s 
in house committee and we’d like 
it to die in house committee.”

In light of the recent cycling 

deaths in the city, the council 
unanimously approved a resolu-
tion to allocate $1,000 from the 
Alternative Transportation Edu-
cation Budget to fund a Bike Light 
Giveaway 
Program. 
Council-

member Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) 
said community feedback on the 
proposal has been positive.

“It shouldn’t take a tragedy 

to make us act, but sometimes it 
does,” she said. “One of the solu-
tions that was brought to me was 
to make cyclists more visible. We 
know that the last couple acci-
dents that the cyclists did not 
have lights on their bikes, so we 
want to do something about that.”

Grand said the resolution will 

allocate money to get the ball roll-
ing in regard to cyclist safety in 
the city.

Smith, who was a co-sponsor 

of the resolution, encouraged the 
public to know that this is just the 
beginning of cyclist safety discus-
sions for council.

“This is a Band-Aid, this is a 

short term fix,” he said. “These 
tragedies tell us that we have a 
need. We have a need for better 
cycling safety infrastructure. We 
can’t do that overnight.”

The meeting also brought in 

another round of anti-deer cull 
protestations. Approximately 20 
protesters, clad in red shirts and 
carrying “Stop the Shoot” signs, 
arrived at the meeting to dem-
onstrate against the forthcoming 
deer cull in Ann Arbor, which city 
officials hope will help curb the 
city’s deer population.

Though the cull was approved 

at the Nov. 7 council meeting, two 
public speakers took the podium 
anyway to urge council for a mor-
atorium.

Anthropology Prof. Jennifer 

Robertson cited studies on deer 
fertility programs as viable alter-
natives to a cull, which she said 

she felt were more ethical.

“The cull has polarized Ann 

Arbor like never before,” Robert-
son said. “What is troubling to me 
on ethical grounds is the council’s 
support of gun violence. Non-
lethal methods have not been 
introduced, rather killing was the 
first resort.”

Despite protestations and a 

recent petition circulating to 
recall Councilmember Kirk West-
phal (D–Ward 2), the deer cull is 
set to happen this winter and 
will not be reopened for a vote by 
council as of now.

Grant Strobl, the newly elected 

government relations chair for 
the University’s Central Student 
Government, also attended the 
meeting to introduce himself to 
the council. He said he wanted 
to communicate to council that 
he will serve as a voice of the stu-
dents.

“I am tasked with working 

with locals to provide input on 
policy and provide the student 
perspective,” he said.

Rakestraw said he was impressed 
with Duggan’s efforts to ensure 
the city is well lit.

“So much of wanting to go to 

a city is being comfortable and 
feeling safe in it,” Rakestraw said. 
“I thought it was really cool how 
much he emphasized making 
sure the streets were clean and 
well lit as a precursor to making 
real change. It seemed like the 
kind of response you would get 
from someone who is looking at 
the big picture in totality.”

Duggan has also spearheaded 

a 
number 
of 
crime-fighting 

initiatives in Detroit.

Given that the city does not 

have the resources to employ 
more policemen, Duggan said 
the current police force must be 
used more efficiently. Even with 
current law enforcement efforts, 
the city’s murder rate fell by 3 
percent in 2014.

“If we are going to reduce 

crime in the city of Detroit, I 
need to take the same 2,400 cops 
and use them smarter than we 
ever did before,” he said. “And 
so we are essentially, for those of 
you who are ‘Moneyball’ fans, we 
are applying ‘Moneyball’ policies 
to fighting crime. And it’s pretty 
interesting to see business school 
grads and cops mixing. The key 
to getting violence down is you 
have to get criminals to make 
different decisions. How do you 
get them to change the decision 
not to commit the crime in the 
first place?”

Ceasefire Detroit is a program 

the city has implemented to 
address this question. Under the 
program, the city brings 30 to 40 
residents, many of them youth, 
with known criminal histories 
together for a discussion once a 
month. Community members, 
Duggan and the Wayne County 
prosecutor are all present to 
speak about the state of violence 
in Detroit.

“We’ve had 30 American men 

and women killed in Iraq last 
year, in this one little corner 
of Detroit we’ve had 40 people 
murdered,” Duggan said. “It is 
more violent in our corner of 
Detroit than in war-torn parts of 
the world. And what I say to them 
is, the ones who are most likely to 
be the next victim, are you. The 
violence has to end.”

Duggan has also worked to 

jumpstart GreenLight, a program 
aimed at securing high-risk gas 
stations. The nine participating 
gas stations will be lit out to the 
street front and outfitted with 
high-resolution, color security 
cameras. These cameras will 
be connected through Wi-Fi to 
police headquarters where there 
is a real-time crime center.

“The technology is so advanced 

that 
if 
somebody 
carjacks 

somebody at a gas station, we 
will be able to rewind that image 
at police headquarters, take 
a snapshot, send it out to the 
patrol cars in the area that have 

laptops so that they’ll be able to 
see the cars and the perpetrators 
immediately,” he said.

Duggan also emphasized the 

importance of enticing young 
people to move to Detroit — an 
area where he said he has seen 
significant improvement.

“Today every housing unit in 

downtown Detroit is leased out, 
there is a six-month wait list,” 
he said. “We caught this trend 
of the millennials who don’t 
want to live in the suburbs and 
drive a minivan, who want to 
be closely connected, who have 
creative energy, are moving in in 
remarkable numbers. We have a 
lot of initiatives going on in the 
arts side, the cultural side.”

For one thing, the city has 

launched a program called Motor 
City Match, which will give out 
$500,000 every quarter for the 
next five years to new businesses 
in the form of $50,000 grants. 
Last quarter, 370 people applied 
for one of 10 grants.

Business sophomore Emily 

Gorman, a Michigan native, 
said she is excited by the city’s 
continued 
improvements 
and 

will consider living there after 
graduation.

“I 
definitely 
can 
envision 

myself there,” Gorman said. 
“I love the city, I volunteered 
there a lot in high school. I think 
there’s so much more energy 
there than people see. You see 
the perceptions around campus 
of people who aren’t from around 
the area, or even who are from 
the area. But whenever I go 
there’s just such an energy to 
bring Detroit back to what it used 
to be, and I just think that it’s a 
really cool place to be.”

Rakestraw expressed similar 

sentiments.

“All the stuff that’s happening 

with Shinola, the recent tech 
investments, what Dan Gilbert’s 
doing with Quicken Loans, to me 
it seems like the next American 
town,” he said. “As a young 
person, why not go where things 
are exciting?”

“The implications that a student 

representative must either shed 
all ideas or stop expressing them 
and that a basic requirement for 
leadership in CSG is either to 
have no ideas or to remain silent 
is foreign to the underpinnings 
of a free democracy,” Arm wrote 
in an e-mail interview with The 
Michigan Daily on Monday.

Arm said the protest’s purpose 

was to provoke thought and 
expression, and that he was 
responding 
to 
the 
protesters’ 

invitation to look at their display 
and produce a response.

“I am a fervent believer in 

political pluralism and freedom of 
speech,” he wrote. “It is impossible 
that all members of Central 
Student Government will please 
all students all the time. Some 
students will inevitably disagree 
with us and even disdain us for the 
decisions we make and the votes 
we take.”

Whether it was regarded as a 

matter worthy of investigation, 
Hislop said there will be positive 
takeaways from the experience.

“This investigation will allow 

for CSG to improve our Operating 
Procedures, which at the moment 
lack a clear definition as to how and 
when the Ethics Committee should 
be used,” Hislop wrote. “We need 
to improve the rules we operate by 
so future cases are not marked by 
this same confusion.”

One such improvement in the 

rules would be whether or not a 
student has right to legal counsel 
in ethics hearings, which the ethics 
committee requested the rules 

committee determine. Hislop also 
wrote the investigation can lead to 
a dialogue on counter-narratives 
through the University.

Arm said in an e-mail he was 

happy the committee confirmed 
that his right to free speech was 
protected under the Student Body 
Constitution.

“It is a shame that those who 

disagree with me politically tried 
to make me the first because of 
my public support for Israel,” Arm 
wrote. “Freedom of speech is of 
critical importance and all students 
should recognize that truth. I hope 
that in the future all students will 
be able to engage in respectful 
dialogue freely without fear of 
repercussions for their ideas.”

The 
ethics 
committee 

wrote in the report that while 
representatives should be held to 
higher standards than the average 
student, Arm’s words should not be 
held against him.

“We as an Assembly cannot 

let hurtful words stop us from 
having important dialogue and 
from making difficult decisions,” 
the report said. “The Ethics 
Committee encourages students 
and representatives to continue 
to passionately and respectfully 
advocate on behalf of the causes 
they believe in.”

Arm said he was pleased by the 

results of the investigation, and is 
eager to continue his work in CSG.

“I hope that in the future all 

students will be able to engage in 
respectful dialogue freely without 
fear of repercussions for their 
ideas,” Arm wrote. “In the future, I 
hope we can vet these accusations 
more seriously before conducting 
big investigations and bringing a 
student’s name into the media.”

said. “But then the rains will 
stop, and the floods will drain, 
what are people going to do 
about the damage?”

Venkatachalam 
and 

Lakshmi Narayanan said many 
of their Indian classmates 
in the Business School call 
Chennai their home, and still 
have direct or extended family 
living there. The pair has been 
working with other students 
to contact family and friends.

“We couldn’t reach people 

because the phone lines were 
down, there was no power 
and the ground floor and 
first stories of houses were 
submerged,” 
Venkatachalam 

said. “We had no idea if people 
were actually OK, including 
our own family members.”

The two Business students 

attended high school together 
in Chennai, and have retained 
connections with the city.

“The estimate of damages 

right now is about $3 billion,” 
Lakshmi Narayanan said. “We 
asked ourselves if there was 
anything we could do through 
Ross. This is a place that 
encourages collaboration, this 
is a place that has impacts in 
other parts of the world — the 
outreach is huge.”

They set a goal of raising 

$5,000 for the cause, which 
will be distributed by an 
organization 
working 
on 

the ground in India. In one 
day, they had already raised 
half that amount, in part by 
contacting the Ross School of 

Business Student Government 
Association 
and 
other 

associations on campus to 
spread the word.

“We 
thought, 
‘Hey, 
we 

should do something about 
this,’ and we felt that the 
Ross 
Student 
Government 

Association has the maximum 
reach,” Lakshmi Narayanan 
said.

The Ross SGA distributed an 

e-mail to all Business students, 
faculty and staff Thursday 
urging people to donate.

After Venkatachalam and 

Lakshmi Narayanan surpassed 
$5,000, they increased their 
goal to $10,000.

The two partnered with an 

organization called Milaap. 
Similar 
to 
GoFundMe, 

provides a forum for donors to 
make contributions.

“The 
site 
was 
started 

by one of our classmates 
in 
undergrad,” 
Lakshmi 

Narayanan 
said. 
“We 

knew it was an authentic 
institution and there’s a lot of 
accountability in where the 
money gets dispensed and how 
it’s used.”

The 
website 
will 
also 

include 
campaign 
updates 

throughout the process.

“The 
link 
has 
updates 

about how well we are doing, 
where the money is going and 
showing the receipts of the 
money 
being 
transferred,” 

Venkatachalam said.

Lakshmi Narayanan said 

the money will be spread 
across different causes.

“The initial money is going 

towards helping people find 
water and food,” she said. 

“People have lost all their 
clothes, all their food, all 
their money. We want to also 
provide 
that 
rehabilitation 

support.”

Business 
Prof. 
Puneet 

Manchanda, 
who 
studies 

emerging markets, particularly 
business in India, said the 
recent floods are destroying 
Chennai’s infrastructure.

“The 
effects 
are 
truly 

devastating, 
both 
from 
a 

human capital and a business 
point of view,” he said. “A lot 
of people are stranded, a lot of 
people are stuck, and there’s 
a big economic impact of a 
shutdown of all the services.”

Manchanda noted that by 

channeling the money through 
a 
local 
organization, 
the 

students are making sure the 
funds go to a good use.

“There’s 
always 
a 
need 

for money to make things 
happen,” 
Manchanda 
said. 

“The students are doing an 
awesome job at collecting 
money.”

Both 
Venkatachalam 

and 
Lakshmi 
Narayanan 

emphasized the importance of 
student contributions.

“As 
a 
community, 
we 

should be proud of ourselves,” 
Lakshmi Narayanan said. “We 
all are students and faculty 
contributing, and for us to be 
able to say, ‘This is a meal for 
me, but instead I’m going to 
give it to the people who need 
it,’ that’s just phenomenal. To 
see it in our community at the 
University says we should be 
really proud about it.” 

basis for an interdisciplinary 
symposium titled, “Conjuring the 
Caribbean: How Sweet it is.”

Bahadur’s 
novel, 
“Coolie 

Woman: 
The 
Odyssey 
of 

Indenture,” focuses on the lost 
histories of enslaved women, 
like 
her 
great-grandmother. 

The women described in the 
book were often uprooted from 
their families, or were runaways 
who fled from India to Guiana 
only to face more mistreatment. 
A “Coolie” is a name that was 
traditionally given to indentured 
laborers by the British.

Throughout 
their 
journeys 

and in Guiana, Bahadur said 
these indentured women were 
subjected to sexual assault and 
domestic violence. Many were 
simply killed. Bahadur said she 
wrote the book not only to create 
a tangible record for her great-
grandmother, but to discover 
more about herself.

“Does ‘Coolie Woman’ provide 

a home in the world for my great-
grandmother and the women like 
her?” Bahadur asked. “Does it 
provide more for me and women 
like me? I’d like to think that the 
answer to both questions is yes. 
Telling the stories of indentured 
women gives them a place in 
history, a symbolic home and it also 
gives their descendants a home 
and a sense of self, of identity.”

Much of Bahadur’s keynote 

focused on the archives she 
worked with while researching 
the book. The archives, however, 
did not provide a full record, and 
Bahadur found she needed to 
find ways to work around the 
gaps. Because the majority of the 
primary sources from this time 
were written by translators or by 
the very people who oppressed 
the indentured women, she said 
they cannot fully convey the 
women’s thoughts and feelings.

In an attempt to fill these 

gaps, 
Bahadur 
listened 
to 

period folk music, as well as 
viewed pictures of and listened 
to audio interviews with some 
of the women. Bahadur noted 
that even some of the accounts 
the women gave were not fully 
representative 
because 
the 

trauma they endured made it very 
difficult for them to talk frankly 
about their experiences. Instead 
of letting the sometimes false or 
contradictory archives hinder 
the research, Bahadur said she 
actively used the archives to 
further her novel’s plot.

In the novel, Bahadur said 

the gaps in the limited archival 
material provided as much of a 
subject as the actual histories.

“(The book) is a history 

written with the archive, but 
also 
against 
the 
archive,” 

she said. “It uses questions, 
sometimes cheeky questions, to 
expose the archive for the fiction 
it sometimes is. The archive 
becomes the subject itself.”

Of the roughly 50 people who 

attended the event, many were 
graduate students who were 
either artist scholars or were 
studying topics related to the 
keynote and symposium.

Manan Desai, an assistant 

professor in American Culture 
and 
Asian/Pacific 
Islander 

American Studies, had actually 
featured some of Bahadur’s work 
in the class he teaches: South 
Asian Diaspora in North America. 
He said that he was pleased 
with the event as it highlighted 
a history not many people in the 

United States know about.

“I thought it was really great,” 

Desai said. “I think she not 
only talked about this kind of 
important history that I think a 
lot of people, specifically in the 
United States and even the South 
Asian Diaspora in the United 
States don’t know about; I think 
she also talked about the difficulty 
of recuperating histories when 
you’re dealing with archives that 
silence many of these voices. I 
thought that was really beautifully 
and powerfully described.”

Gonzalez 
thought 
that 

Bahadur’s keynote provided a solid 
basis for the rest of the symposium.

“This was definitely a great 

kickoff event because each of the 
presentations frame things in the 
context of conjuring and sugar, 
which are two of the metaphors 
that we want to explore as we 
start to talk about the process 
of how the Caribbean resonates 
today and with the historical 
past,” Gonzalez said.

‘U’ researchers 
develop breast 
cancer application

The University’s Comprehen-

sive Cancer Center developed 
Breast Cancer Ally, a free app 
aimed at breast cancer patients 
and their physicians. 

Using the app, patients can 

track their treatment progress 
and their physicians can tailor 
treatment plans to fit specific 
patients. 

Components of the app are spe-

cific to each patient and are based 
off of the patient’s data. 

Right now the app is only being 

used at the University Hospital. 

“The treatment recommenda-

tions and advice are in line with 
what the UM oncologists are 
discussing with the patients, so 
they aren’t receiving conflicting 
information, as can happen when 
one uses a generic app or website 
for information,” said Dr. Michael 
Sabel, a breast cancer surgeon 
who led the app’s development. 

Former Courser, 
Gamrat aides sue 
Michigan House

Two ex-staffers for former 

State Reps. Cindy Gamrat (R–
Plainwell) and Todd Courser 
(R–Lapeer) are suing the Michi-
gan House of Representatives 
for wrongful termination. 

In July it emerged that Cours-

er and Gamrat had used their 
taxpayer-funded offices to cover 
up their relationship. According 
to audio recordings obtained 
by The Detroit News, Courser 
planned to distribute a fictional 
e-mail that said he had sex with 
a male prostitute in an effort 
to distract from his affair with 
Gamrat. 

In September, Courser 

resigned and an hour later, 
Gamrat was expelled on a 91-12 
vote. 

Keith Allard and Ben Graham 

worked for Courser and Gam-
rat until July 6, at which point 
they were fired. The two are 
now suing the House and claim-
ing that their firings violated 
their freedom of speech and the 
federal Whistleblowers’ Protec-
tion Act. They also alleged that 
by releasing documents that 
included their Social Security 
numbers, the House violated 
their privacy. 

Members of the 
state Congress 
ask Obama to 
reconsider order

Six Republican members of 

Michigan’s Congress are asking 
President Obama to reconsider 
his decision to have law enforce-
ment agencies return surplus 
military equipment. 

The request was signed by 

Mike Bishop (R–Rochester), Bill 
Huizenga (R–Zeeland), Candice 
Miller (R–Harrison Township), 
John Moolenaar (R–Midland), 
Dave Trott (R–Birmingham) and 
Fred Upton (R–St. Joseph). 

Just last week, the Detroit 

Free Press reported that Michi-
gan law enforcement agencies 
were expressing frustration 
with the loss of military equip-
ment. These agencies said 
Obama’s decision has taken 
away key assets that cannot eas-
ily be replaced. 

Obama issued his executive 

order pertaining to surplus 
military equipment last Janu-
ary. The decision was made after 
protests across the country drew 
attention to the militarization of 
local police. The policy requires 
that local police return tracked 
armored vehicles, weaponized 
aircraft and grenade launchers, 
among other prohibited items. 

The letter pointed to last 

week’s shootings in San Ber-
nardino, Calif. as one reason 
for local law enforcement to 
retain such prohibited items. 
The representatives argue that 
the executive order will make 
it challenging for law enforce-
ment officials to thwart terrorist 
attacks.

Gun rights are not absolute

A

s I watched the nation’s 
response to the latest wave 
of gun violence, a lesson on 

rights taught by 
my 
philosophy 

GSI during my 
sophomore year 
came to mind. 
Rights are great, 
he 
effectively 

said. The problem 
is that everyone 
has them.

When 
two 

people’s 
rights 

conflict, 
in 
a 

sense, 
they 

cancel out the imperative nature of 
the other’s right. Deciding what to do 
based on what’s required to uphold 
someone’s right is no longer adequate 
when two rights necessitate mutually 
exclusive 
action. 
The 
decision 

remains over what should be done.

Rights are central to the gun 

control debate. Many individuals 
— as well as the Supreme Court — 
interpret the Second Amendment to 
mean that Americans have the right 
to own and carry guns. But there is 
another right at stake as well — the 
right to life.

When the founders drafted the 

Constitution, they originally omitted 
a guarantee of specific personal 
liberties out of fear that it would be 
interpreted as an exclusive list. The 
Bill of Rights was later added with the 
clear message that the enumerated 
rights were not the only ones worthy 
of protection.

The right to life was not included 

in the Bill of Rights, but it’s clear that 
it underpins the Constitution itself. 
The Declaration of Independence 
boldly 
declared 
life 
to 
be 
an 

inalienable right. And really, could 
anyone enjoy their right to bear arms 
if they weren’t already alive to do so?

The idea that everyone has the 

right to live seems obvious; the 
government’s broad responsibility 
to protect the lives of its citizens is 
uncontroversial. It tasks itself with 
deterring murder, fighting terrorism 
and subsidizing life-saving health 
care. In many cases, Americans even 
tolerate a tradeoff of their personal 
liberties to enable the government to 
protect them.

But gun control debates have 

taken a different tune. Any proposed 
infringement on individuals’ rights 

to buy or carry weapons is viewed 
by many as strictly unconstitutional. 
Recently, the Senate even voted down 
a bill to prevent those on the terrorist 
watch list from buying guns.

The 
bill 
was 
derided 
for 

potentially placing an undue burden 
on a relatively small number of 
potentially 
innocent 
individuals’ 

rights to purchase weapons without 
due process because those on the 
list are suspected — not convicted —
teorrist threats. Despite the fact that 
former President George W. Bush 
advocated a similar policy in 2007, 
votes generally fell along party lines 
and the bill failed.

We have to change the way we 

talk about gun control. Framing gun 
control as a clear-cut personal liberties 
issue inhibits our ability to adequately 
respond to the specific issue of gun 
violence, as well as to our broadly 
construed counterterrorism efforts.

As groups like ISIS strengthen 

their ability to aid naturalized 
radicals in carrying out violent 
attacks, it will be crucial that the 
federal and state governments have 
a broader set of policies at their 
disposal to limit the damage these 
groups can do. Strict adherence to 
a pro-gun ideology that hamstrings 
even basic initiatives to prevent 
weapons from falling into terrorists’ 
hands is not a viable way to 
safeguard Americans against this 
evolving threat.

Many pro-gun advocates hold 

that the solution to the gun problem 
is to simply arm more benevolent 
bystanders. 
Friday, 
Liberty 

University President Jerry Falwell 
Jr. even encouraged his students to 
carry weapons to protect themselves 
and others. In their view, there is 
no tradeoff between respecting 
individuals’ right to carry guns and 
protecting their right to live safe 
from gunfire. According to their 
argument, the only thing standing in 
the way of a safer society is the fact 
that more people don’t go about their 
days armed and ready to shoot an 
active gunman.

This argument makes one pivotal 

assumption: These armed good 
guys are both capable and willing 
to shoot another person should it 
become necessary.

We don’t live in a country full of 

James Bonds. Shooting is considered 
a sport for a reason — it’s difficult and 

most people can’t master it easily. 
Even hitting a non-moving target at 
a shooting range is difficult — I’ve 
tried unsuccessfully on more than 
one occasion. Accurately targeting 
a moving gunman amidst all of the 
chaos inherent in an active-shooter 
situation may be a higher bar than 
the average concealed carry licensee 
could conceivably clear.

There is also little data to support 

the idea that more guns lead to fewer 
deaths by gun violence. The number of 
concealed handgun permits increased 
more than 15 percent in 2014 alone. 
Yet, crime rates involving gun violence 
haven’t fallen. In other countries, 
lower per capita gun ownership is 
actually correlated with lower rates of 
violent crime involving guns.

I come from a family of hunters. 

I strongly believe that guns have 
a 
sizeable, 
legitimate 
place 
in 

American culture. For those who 
know how to use and care for their 
guns responsibly, the weapons also 
have valuable functions both in sport 
and personal protection.

The government has a clear 

obligation to respect its citizens’ 
right to bear arms. But respect means 
something very different than what 
the government is currently doing — 
uncritically upholding pro-gun policy 
in all circumstances and at all costs.

Guns have a greater capacity to 

inflict harm than almost anything 
else the average American can legally 
buy. If Americans want to maintain 
their right to bear arms, they also 
must respect the power of those 
weapons. When so many criminals 
— and increasingly, terrorists — use 
guns to inflict harm on others, that 
respect may entail modest limits on 
who can buy the weapons.

In the wake of recent events, 

continuing to allow the free sale and 
carry of guns requires a new attitude 
toward their regulation. Accepting 
the unnecessary deaths of innocent 
Americans 
is 
not 
a 
necessary 

requirement of the continued right 
to bear arms. But using overly 
simplistic personal rights arguments 
to posture against common-sense, 
popularly 
supported 
gun 
law 

reforms inhibits the government’s 
ability to protect its citizens with 
little payoff for gun rights.

What’s in a name?

BEN KELLER, PAYTON LUOKKALA, MELISSA SCHOLKE | ROUNDTABLE

In recent weeks, controversy has brewed at 

Princeton University surrounding its School of 
Public and International Affairs being named in 
honor of President Woodrow Wilson. Given the 
recent outcry surrounding Wilson’s racist policies, 
there has been significant debate as to whether 
his name should remain attached to the school. 
In this roundtable discussion, Daily Editorial 
Board members Ben Keller, Payton Luokkala and 
Melissa Scholke give their takes on the situation 
at Princeton and discuss whether the University 
should also examine the names on its buildings. 

KELLER: 
It’s 
commonplace 
to 
honor 

individuals by placing their names on buildings. 
However, when information is brought forth that 
damages the credibility of these people, should 
we immediately rush to strip them of their honor 
and rename such buildings? Or is it at all possible 
to debate the lives of these men and women to 
possibly come to some sort of compromise?

The recent revelation at Princeton University 

regarding the presidency of Woodrow Wilson 
has prompted national outcries for the Wilson 
School of Public and International Affairs to 
change its name. Wilson, also a former president 
at Princeton, has come under scrutiny for 
racist policies he enacted during his time in the 
White House. However, he’s also remembered 
for reforms that laid the groundwork for the 
future policies of highly revered presidents, like 
President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. 

Herein lies the conflict: Does Wilson’s 

racism automatically disqualify him from name 
recognition? Or does his stature as a president of 
the United States and the forerunner of lauded 
policies supersede his discriminatory practices?

Roosevelt is a prime example of this 

conundrum. For decades, he has been extolled as 
one of our nation’s greatest presidents. He led us 
out of the Great Depression and through World 
War II. However, many seem to forget that he 
ordered the internment of innocent Japanese 
Americans during the same war. Where’s the 
outrage over this blatantly racist action by FDR? 
Should we strip his name off of buildings or 
remove his face from our currency?

I would assume most people would say that 

sort of action would be unnecessary given 
Roosevelt’s impact on this nation beyond his 
mistakes. Nevertheless, the line between what 
qualifies a figure in our nation’s history as good 
or bad is too arbitrary. Therefore, the decision to 
abolish a titular honor given to a man or woman of 
the past must be left to the respective institution 
that harbors that recognition. 

This constant battle of what defines our 

predecessors takes place on more campuses 
than just Princeton. Take the University as 
an example.

The C.C. Little Building is named for one of 

our past University presidents, Clarence Cook 
Little. His presidency in and of itself is virtually 
inconsequential and didn’t include significant 
alterations to campus. However, Little was an 
avowed believer of the eugenics movement — an 
early 20th century development that advocated 
for the sterilization of humans whose offspring 
were deemed “unfit for society.” 

Now we come to the all-important question: 

Does Little’s affiliation with the eugenics 
movement (even serving as president of the 
American Eugenics Society) outweigh his 
stature as a past president of the University and 
thus justify the removal of his name from the 
C.C. Little Building? I believe that it certainly 
could, but other options should also be brought 
forth that can give Little the recognition he 
deserves as a past University president while also 
acknowledging his misguided beliefs. A portrait 
in the Michigan Union could suffice along with a 
web history of our past presidents if the name of 
the building were to be changed.

There’s no certain criteria to decide when 

someone deserves to have their name on a 
building of higher education or whether to have 
it removed. Clearly, these situations need to be 
reviewed on a case-by-case basis in order to 
ensure that the people who laid the foundation 
for our lives aren’t unjustly recognized or 
deprived of that recognition.

With so many conflicting facts and stances 

being used in the same debate, it’s important 
to remember an idea that is encompassed in a 
statement made by David Wilkins, the chairman 
of the Clemson University Board of Trustees, 
when a building name at that university was 
engulfed in controversy: “Every great institution 
is built by imperfect craftsmen. Stone by stone 
they add to the foundation so that over many, 
many generations, we get a variety of stones 
… Some of our historical stones are rough and 

even unpleasant to look at. But they are ours 
and denying them as part of our history does not 
make them any less so.”

SCHOLKE: The recent student protests at 

Princeton — and the subsequent public outcries 
— have ignited a broader, overdue discussion 
about both the accuracy of the histories we 
are typically presented with in society and the 
merits of the historical figures whose names 
and legacies are memorialized in this fashion. I 
think the conversation initiated at Princeton is 
absolutely necessary and needs to be echoed at 
numerous institutions of higher education across 
the country, including the University.

It’s important for us, as a society, to 

acknowledge that our system of recording and 
retelling history is flawed and has overlooked 
the viewpoints and experiences of numerous 
groups. Adorning prestigious buildings with 
the names of prominent figures without 
a doubt memorializes these individuals 
and their legacies for generations. Many of 
these individuals — a list that includes U.S. 
presidents, university presidents, prominent 
policymakers and influential scientists — 
certainly deserve to be praised for their 
respective achievements and contributions to 
society. However, society cannot ignore the 
fact that the practice of placing these names on 
notable buildings, more often than not, presents 
and perpetuates a sanitized representation of 
these individual’s legacies that continues to 
exclude their more questionable actions and 
the negative consequences of those actions.

Here at the University, negative aspects of the 

pasts of figures such as President Gerald R. Ford, 
C.C. Little, Sam Zell and Sanford Weill could be 
similarly scrutinized. Perhaps the use of C.C. 
Little’s name on a building serves as one example 
of a legacy that we may need to reconsider.

LUOKKALA: Earlier, Keller questioned 

at what point one should draw the line that 
separates important figures from being 
honored or scorned. This is the contention; 
it is entirely subjective as to where such a 
line is drawn, but subjective to what? The 
individual, the society, the time? The answer 
to this question is difficult precisely because 
it isn’t permanent across time or to any 
constellation of people. This is where I get 
stuck. Keller continued that we are engaged 
in a “constant” discussion of what defines our 
past leaders. 

It’s the use of the word constant that is 

troubling. Because I think the problem here is 
that the battle hasn’t been constant; the issue 
hasn’t been properly attended to throughout 
time. While some thought certainly went 
into renaming a building after C.C. Little 
many years ago, I find it difficult to believe 
that the fact that the former University 
president studied eugenics in his spare time 
was discussed thoroughly as a factor. I think 
this because I cannot imagine how our own 
University thought we would be completely 
satisfied with the honor they chose to bestow.

The problem, again, is that this discussion 

hasn’t 
been 
constant. 
Like 
Scholke 

acknowledged, this is in part due to the 
inadequate way we keep history. One simple 
story is kept and retold; history is often painted 
in broad strokes of entirely “good” or entirely 
“bad.” These hidden histories are a problem 
not only because they exist, but also because 
we’re just now finding out about them.

This recognition provides no easy solution. 

We’re unable to change the lack of forethought in 
those before us, nor can we uncover all of the lost 
histories. Though it isn’t a solution to our past, 
we must start getting rid of the black-and-white 
manner in which we currently view important 
figures, to prevent current revelations that show 
us a history we hadn’t known existed. 

Through all of this, I have managed to evade 

coming to any conclusion: Keep the names or 
don’t. While we can acknowledge that beliefs 
and practices of individuals such as C.C. Little 
and Woodrow Wilson are wrong, the debate 
against changing the names includes valid 
points as well. Like I previously mentioned, 
people aren’t one-dimensional, which makes 
it difficult to judge whether or not they 
are “worthy” of the honor. It has also been 
questioned whether changing the names would 
hide history even further. 

In conclusion, amid the controversies 

erupting across the nation, I ask: Given that 
we have a limited account of history and an 
arbitrary ability to judge others, when, if ever, 
is it right to take action? The answer is: Until we 
can no longer ignore the problem.

Our world is better than ever

R

eturning 
home 
for 

Thanksgiving weekend, I 
did what any other college 

student 
does 

on Turkey Day 
— I began hour-
long 
debates 

with my elders. 
Our 
discussion 

topics 
varied 

and 
followed 

no clear, linear 
logic. 
Initially, 

we covered ISIS 
(because 
what 

else?), American 
national security, 
and then moved in to lighter topics 
like crime, poverty, religion and the 
Syrian refugee crisis.

Of course, I know the golden rule 

of family dinner conversation: Don’t 
talk about politics or religion — but 
neither I nor my family members 
could help ourselves. It seems 
that argumentation runs through 
our blood; the only escape being 
heated discourse (and for me, the 
convenient platform of the Daily. 
Thanks, editors). So the debating 
continued, volume increased, vocal 
chords were expanded and many 
worked tirelessly to convince their 
ideological opposite wrong.

This 
year, 
though, 
while 
I 

continued the tradition of discussing 
world affairs with those I definitely 
shouldn’t 
be 
discussing 
them 

with, I hoped something about 
the conversation would change 
— specifically, its tone. That is, I 
hoped that even though we’d fiercely 
debate depressing topics, ultimately 
everyone would remain optimistic 
about the future.

See, during most holidays, my 

family members discuss problems 
that plague people high and low in 
our society. We discuss problems 
for the obvious reason that problems 
make life exciting — they provide 
us with the prospect of finding a 
solution, a path toward resolution. 
It’s 
no 
question 
that 
social, 

political and economic problems 
are challenging, but if we didn’t 
have challenging problems, we’d 
be miserably bored and lacking 
purpose. Internally, we’d feel bereft 
without raising potential answers.

Yet even when recognizing our 

continuous problems, it’s important 
that we maintain perspective on 
the overall state of the world. So 
when I hear my family members say 
things like “god, I would not want 
to be young today” and “the world 
is going to shit,” I become more 
irritated with how people perceive 
the world. Unfortunately, I’m not 
at all surprised. Sadly, I hear this 
utterly unfair blanket statement 
about the state of the world all too 
often, not just by my own kin, but 
also by many old and young people 
I encounter.

This defeatist attitude makes me 

uncomfortable because it dismisses an 
incredibly important point about our 
society today. That is, in innumerable 
ways, the state of the world is better 
than it has ever been in human history. 
Throughout my contentious family 
discourse, I’ve tried making this point 
clear, but no matter how I frame it, my 
words fall on deaf ears.

And while it is true that we have 

arduous problems like racial and 
wealth inequality, global warming, 
many acts of gun violence and 
suicide, we must reconcile that, by 
the numbers, our world is getting 
better. People, on average, have 
a higher standard of living and 
higher 
well-being 
around 
the 

world. That is, crime, violence, 
war, homicide, rape and sexual 
assault, famine and abject poverty 
have all declined in the past several 
decades. What’s more, general 
health (due to the eradication of 
disease), life expectancy, literacy, 
education levels, political freedoms 
and opportunities for personal 
autonomy have risen to a higher 
degree than ever before. In many 
ways, we’re moving closer to an 
idyllic utopia. Unfortunately, few 
believe it.

Many people, particularly in 

America, 
interpret 
the 
world 

as 
miserable 
and 
depressing. 

Americans 
perceive 
crime 
and 

violent crime as rising and are more 
fearful of a large terrorist attack 
and Syrian refugees. Regrettably, 
as I’ve noted in my previous article, 
this unwarranted line of thinking 
potentially 
leads 
to 
fear-driven 

practices and policy that influence 
hate and discrimination, thereby 
adversely affecting everyone.

In my opinion, the proliferation of 

information, with particular regard 
for our television sets and computer 
screens, drive this fear. We hear, watch 
and read more horrifying stories 
throughout our day, and for longer 
periods, than ever before. Due to this 
constant bombardment, we perceive 
that our world is crumbling even as we 
walk outside and realize everything is 
fine. That’s why many people believe 
the world is “going to shit.” 

But as noted above, today we’re 

not dying nearly as often due to 
transportation accidents or losing 
infants due to a scarcity of health care 
resources. People’s lives, on the whole, 
are better. 

The measures we have in place for 

safety from the top down in our society 
— our laws, objective judicial systems, 
advanced 
medical 
and 
research 

institutions, and private ownership of 
shelter — has created a safer world for 
U.S. citizens to be sure. 

What all this means is that we 

must step back from the information 
we consume daily online and on our 
TV screens and consider our world 
more broadly. We must zoom out 
and see the world through a lens that 
isn’t painted with human tragedy 
or specific acts of horror. This is 
particularly important considering 
the media’s incentive, knowing 
humans are easily be driven by 
fear and emotion. If we frame our 
vision in a nuanced light, we can 
understand with clearer heads how 
the state of the world is.

Of course, interpreting the world 

differently doesn’t mean we should be 
cut off from it. Citizens everywhere 
deserve to know what is going on. 
However, in a world where it’s easier 
than ever to access information 
from everywhere around the world, 
what we do with that information 
becomes 
increasingly 
important. 

So every time you watch the news, 
consider who’s talking to you and 
the general societies in which 
humans are operating and how 
that’s changed over time. Aside from 
relatively small instances of human 
tragedy (that we, of course, should do 
everything to prevent) the answers 
will more often be optimistic.

EVENT PREVIEW
Love and ‘Piazza’

SMTD production 
explores beauty and 
challenges in Italy

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

If I had to choose an ideal loca-

tion to explore all things beautiful 
and passionate, no doubt it’d be 
Italy.

This 
week-

end, 
at 
the 

Arthur 
Miller 

Theatre, 
stu-

dents 
from 

the School of 
Music, Theatre 
& Dance pres-
ent “The Light 
in the Piazza,” a 
musical explor-
ing the beauty 
of love and the 
challenges that follow.

As a studio production, the 

show centers on actors’ creations 
and the depth they bring toward 
telling this story.

“Being a story of relationships 

and human connection, this show 
lends itself well to a minimal, 
actor-centric approach,” direc-
tor Brian Hill wrote in an e-mail 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “I knew that everything 
was going to have to be actor gen-
erated.”

With a cast of 15 musical the-

atre students, a five-piece orches-
tra and strong technical design, 
this production will, as Hill puts 
it, “feel like a full meal.”

Adapted from Elizabeth Spen-

cer’s novel, with music and lyrics 
by Adam Guettel and a book by 
Craig Lucas, “The Light in the 
Piazza” is set in the 1950s and 
tells the story of Clara and Marga-
ret Johnson, a family from North 
Carolina, who spend the summer 
in Florence. Clara, Margaret’s 
daughter, falls in love with a local 
Italian, Fabrizio, which Margaret 
strongly opposes.

Premiering on Broadway in 

April of 2005, “Piazza” was a huge 
success — which doesn’t come as 
much of a surprise considering the 
talent of the original cast, includ-
ing Victoria Clark as Margaret, 
Kelli O’Hara as Clara and Mat-
thew Morrison as Fabrizio. The 
original production won six Tony 
Awards, including Best Original 
Score, Best Orchestrations, and 
Clark took home an award for Best 
Performance by a Leading Actress 
in a Musical. 

While casting the produc-

tion with such strong roots, Hill 
sought honesty in each character. 
He acknowledged that no one is 
exactly like the members of the 
original cast, just as no one is 
exactly like SMTD students Kaity 
Paschetto (Margaret), Christina 
Maxwell (Clara) or Luke Stein-
hauer (Fabrizio).

“I prefer to let the actors’ indi-

viduality dictate the interpreta-
tion,” Hill wrote.

Hill’s vision for the show focus-

es on what each actor brings to the 
work and how their contributions 
further enhance the story. Due to 
the simplicity of the technical ele-
ments of this production, stage-
craft such as a hat caught in the 
wind, one of the most well-known 

scenes of the show, was created 
through the actors’ choices rather 
than technical support.

“Knowing that we had that lim-

itation set the tone for the physical 
vocabulary of the show ... it has 
been a constantly shifting process 
finding out how to use this vocabu-
lary as effectively as possible.”

Hill’s reaction to these adjust-

ments is not one of deterrence. 

“I love limitations. They always 

lead to creative solutions,” he 
wrote.

While 
considering 
themes 

“Piazza” illuminates, Hill lets the 
story move naturally.

“I think story comes first and 

theme follows as a byproduct,” 
Hill wrote. “My main objective 
has been to tell this gorgeous story 
truthfully.”

And just as each actor brings 

something distinct and unique 
to the roles that audiences have 
grown to love, Hill believes each 
audience member takes something 
different away from this produc-
tion.

“One of the happy surprises 

for me is how much of an ensem-
ble piece this play really is,” Hill 
wrote, while describing the devel-
opment of this work. “This compa-
ny has found a way to tell this story 
as a true ensemble.”

Just as you’d expect, the incred-

ible talent of SMTD students has 
led to very high demand for tickets.

“Though I’m told the run is 

already sold out, if you can get 
a ticket to see the show … do,” 
Hill wrote. “This cast is extraor-
dinary and the entire company 
from orchestra to crew is creating 
something very special.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Remembering John 
Lennon 35 years later

By MATT GALLATIN

For The Daily

The first time I’d ever really 

heard of John Lennon was when 
I was standing at his memorial. 
While walking through Cen-
tral Park with my parents, we 
stopped at Strawberry Fields, 
his quiet commemorative in the 
middle of New York City. I was 
about 12 at the time, and I knew 
The Beatles like I knew the Bible: 
I obviously was aware of its exis-
tence, and I’d heard some parts, 
but I’d never read it and never 
cared to. There was a “Hey Jude” 
rendition on TV that I vaguely 
recalled and I must have heard 
“With A Little Help From My 
Friends” at some point. But other 
than those fleeting moments, 
The Beatles were nameless to me. 
John Lennon meant even less.

Like many 12 year olds, I spent 

half of my time complaining and 
the other half on my oh-so-cool 
new flip phone. But this memo-
rial, which epitomized a man 
and a time of which I was totally 
unfamiliar, managed to move me 
from my adolescent trance. I sat 
on one of the benches and looked 
around — actually looked around.

Strawberry Fields, a small 

blip in the massive park, is far 
less assertive than your average 
memorial. There are no towering 
statues, no imposing sculptures, 
no extended quotes. One word, 
“Imagine,” sits in the center of 
a Portuguese mosaic. All kinds 
of people line the surrounding 
benches, wearing anything from 
the all black of a New Yorker to 
classic ’70s tie-dye. I didn’t make 
the connection at the time, but 
it’s a spot on representation of 
Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War is 
Over)” (“For weak and for strong, 
for rich and the poor ones … for 
black and for white, for yellow 
and red ones”). Flowers were 
placed all around the mosaic 
forming a peace sign, and at the 
entrance a man sat and sang the 
words “love is real, real is love … ”

But none of this can describe 

the emotion that Strawberry 
Fields 
captures. 
Hope, 
love, 

peace or maybe something else 
entirely, hovers in the air like a 
warm cloud. It seeps through 
the looks of the people walking 
by, the couples on the benches, 

and the kids running around. In 
many ways, Strawberry Fields is 
all of John Lennon and none of 
John Lennon. While Lennon was 
straight forward and gritty, his 
memorial is reserved and kind. 
While Lennon struggled with 
inner turmoil, his memorial is 
serene and at ease. Both repre-
sent something much larger than 
themselves. Lennon may have 
once been a man, but what he 
now symbolizes is something far 
greater than flesh and bone. 

Perhaps, though, the most 

beautiful part of John Lennon 
was how imperfect he was. He 
struggled with depression, he 
cheated, he left his first son, he 
had violent bouts and on and on. 
In our era of “problematic” celeb-
rities and TMZ, Lennon would 
far from fit the mold of perfection 
and conformity we demand from 
our idols today. And Lennon didn’t 
care. He gave out Fuck You’s as 
easily and eloquently as he sang 
about love. On “God,” from his solo 
masterpiece John Lennon/Plastic 
Ono Band, he calls out everyone 
from Jesus to Kennedy as a fraud. 
Few then and few now are willing 
to make such blunt, controversial 
statements, and even fewer are so 
universally embraced for it. But 
above it all, John Lennon loved 
this world. His music was critical 
because he saw greatness and hope 
in humanity. He railed against the 
Vietnam War, inequality and poli-
ticians in the hope that something 
would change for the better. And 
yet the violence and hatred he 
fought was the very thing to take 
his life, when 35 years ago today he 
was gunned down in front of his 
home in New York City.

Those issues Lennon was con-

sumed by in the ’60s and ’70s are 
eerily similar to those we deal 
with in 2015. The militant chau-
vinism he warned us of seems just 
as prevalent today than before the 
Vietnam War. Last month, con-
servative Twitter account Cloyd 
Rivers posted “ISIS is coming 
to America … They will come to 
cities and people with no guns 
… Arm yourself. Get training. 
Stand ready.” It was retweeted 
by thousands. Concerns over 
inequality have boiled over into 
protests on our streets and in 
our universities. The sexism that 
Lennon’s feminist voice — given 

to him by activist and wife Yoko 
Ono — derided is still prevalent, 
making it stubbornly difficult for 
women to reach top positions in 
the workforce and adding to per-
vasive levels of sexual assault on 
campuses and across the world. 
Gun violence, the very thing 
John Lennon lost his life to, has 
found its way into our lives with 
alarming regularity.

But there are moments of 

hope. Thousands gathered this 
year in Central Park to commem-
orate Lennon’s 75th birthday, 
forming what would become the 
largest human peace sign ever 
made. As relatively inconsequen-
tial as a moment like that might 
seem, it shows that for all of the 
nihilistic comments that are 
thrown around — “love is dead,” 
“the world is screwed,” etc. — 
there’s still a sense of optimism 
left, something that will hope-
fully never change.

The same is true with music 

today. For some reason, cer-
tain fans seem to believe that 
the industry has been in a state 
of perpetual decline since the 
’70s. Detractors said the indus-
try died with Lennon, and then 
again with Cobain, and again 
with Tupac. But “real” music is 
far from dead, assured by leaders 
like Kendrick and Killer Mike. 
Their socially charged poetry, 
while tackling different specific 
issues than Lennon, is based on 
the same activist spirit that we 
hail Lennon for. Take Kendrick’s 
song “Alright” from his pro-
test album To Pimp a Butterfly. 
“N***a, we gon’ be alright” might 
not be as delicate as “imagine all 
the people, sharing the world as 
one,” but the message is similar. 
Both recognize problems that 
pervade our society while still 
evoking hope.

We might not all be living in 

communes or crossing the coun-
try in painted Volkswagen vans, 
but 35 years later John Lennon’s 
legacy remains strong. Maybe 
this is because 2015 isn’t so dif-
ferent from Lennon’s own era. 
We fight some of the same battles 
and we deal with many of the 
same problems. And just as they 
needed Lennon’s voice in the ’60s 
and ’70s, we need it today. If you 
look in the right places, you’ll 
find it.

TV REVIEW
‘Top Model’ goes out 
with a fizzle in finale

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

After 12 years and crowning 

22 top (in title only) models, 
“America’s Next Top Model” 
quietly ended 
its run Friday 
night with its 
second 
male 

winner, 
deaf 

model 
Nyle 

Dimarco. 
Tyra Banks’s 
muse gave the 
world the ulti-
mate 
freak-

out, 
endless 

surprises 
and Jade. However, in its final 
installment, “ANTM ” failed 
to encapsulate its own place in 
pop culture history, going out 
with an episode rather than a 
celebration.

Beginning the two-part fina-

le with four contests: Lacey, 
Mikey, Mamé and Nyle, the 
show milked the models’ roles 
to extreme lengths with ubiq-
uitous off-camera commentary 
— which consisted of Lacey’s 
weight loss and purity tirades, 
Mikey’s mini-monologues on 
his destiny for prison, Mamé’s 
relationship drama and Nyle’s 
gushings 
on 
modeling 
and 

deafness. Even by the end of 
the first episode, it’s painfully 
obvious that each contestant’s 

uniqueness had been talked to 
death, leaving no words fresh 
enough to further the cast’s 
dispositions. And when models 
aren’t discussing themselves, 
topics range from explorations 
of narcissism to vamping of 
the competition’s meaning and 
importance.

Following the final four’s last 

photo shoot, a campaign for Zap-
pos Couture, Mamé and Nyle are 
declared finalists, competing in 
the finale runway show flanked by 
their fellow cycle-22-ers. Mamé 
(semi-successfully) 
addressed 

how she cozied up with Mikey 
after beau, Justin, was elimi-
nated in episode 10. This cycle’s 
clown, Devin, has just enough 
camera time to remind viewers 
why he wasn’t missed while the 
remaining almost-top models 

not-so-subtly support their pick 
for the title.

Tyra Banks — the show’s only 

consistent figure — was its com-
pass as always. Surprising view-
ers with fashion choices (that nose 
ring), and charming them with her 
gravitas and energy, it’s only sad 
that her gravity to the program 
wasn’t expressed in screentime 
or fresh commentary. Too often, 
her lines left deliberations and 
feedback in the realm of any old 
“ANTM” rerun on Oxygen rather 
than than that of a true series 
finale.

In 
between 
the 
fleeting 

moments of tenderness between 
contestants and their mothers and 
fashion industry chic, “America’s 
Next Top Model” ’s final shot felt 
dated and left me missing Janice 
Dickinson more than ever.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
The best Young Thug 
songs I heard in 2015

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

Young Thug is both the 

antithesis of 2015’s rap scene 
and its greatest product. In 
a year defined by responses 
to racial tension (I’m looking 
at you, To Pimp A Butterfly), 
he 
seemed 
completely 

uninterested in making any sort 
of social commentary. While 
other heavy-hitters struggled 
with relevance (Lil Wayne) 
and respect (Drake), Thugger 
dominated by just not giving 
a 
fuck. 
His 
unpretentious 

attitude felt refreshing in a sea 
of serious rappers, his rapid 
product output provided a stark 
contrast to artists leaving us in 
the dark about release dates 
and his all around eccentricity 
ushered in a completely new 
style of hip hop.

But before reading, please 

note that this is not a list of the 
best Young Thug songs of the 
year but of the best Young Thug 
songs I’ve heard this year. The 
dude puts out a new track every 
other day, and they can be 
pretty difficult to sift through. 
I could easily copy and paste the 
full Barter 6 track list on here 
and call it a day (because that 
album is just straight bangers), 
but that wouldn’t be doing 
the rapper justice. Instead, I 
sorted through that and his 
other prominent projects of 
2015, Slime Season and Slime 
Season 2. And while this list is 
undoubtedly premature — he’ll 
definitely put out more music 
during 
December 
— 
these 

songs remain some of his most 
significant of the year.

10. “Be Me See Me”
As the lone Metro Boomin-

produced 
track 
on 
an 

otherwise 
London 
On 
Da 

Track-dominated Slime Season, 
it makes sense that this song 
stands out, if for no reason 
other than its production. The 
fact that it has an aggressive 
Thugger rapping over it just 
makes it even better.

9. “Phoenix” 
I love Thug songs that could 

almost be sad but then aren’t 
because it’s Young Thug, you 
know? Like, you can still 
get drunk to this song. And 
not “crying alone in your 
room” drunk, but, like, drunk 
drunk. But really, this is as 

introspective as we’ve seen 
the rapper, but still offers 
some of his classic lyricism: 
“Kuna Matata I need you, I am 
a Mufasa genius / Baby come 
fuck for no reason.” It’s oh so 
satisfying.

8. “With That” 
To be honest, a lot of this 

song doesn’t make sense. And 
when it does, chances are you 
can’t understand it anyways. 
The harsh switching of flows 
could make it hard to swallow 
if not for the syrupy production 
that coats it with an irresistible 
sweetness.

7. “Hey, I”
To the surprise of many, 

Young 
Thug 
is 
quite 
the 

romantic. In the most melodic 
and 
strangely 
linear 
track 

we’ve gotten from the rapper, 
he sings about a woman that’s 
“ready for a kiddy.” He lets 
his guard down with her — “I 
might just tell this hoe my 
secret” — and even swears 
off other women — “I, want 
nothing to do with none of 
these lil bitches.” But of course, 
it ends with the song’s most 
heartfelt line: “I’m going down 
on her hard till I’m partition.” 
Can someone write a song like 
that about me?

6. “Power”
Despite 
leaking 
months 

before its official release on 
Slime Season, I didn’t hear 
“Power” until a video of a 
little 
girl 
singing 
it 
went 

viral. Thank god I did though, 
because this song features one 
of my favorite lines on the tape: 
“She sucked like eight dicks, I 
call her Octagon.”

5. “Flaws”
Isaac 
Flame’s 
production 

is flawless. Thug’s verses are 
some of his strongest. This 
song just straight bangs.

4. “Raw (Might Just)”
This ballad — if you want 

to call it that — is everything 
I didn’t know I wanted from 
Young 
Thug. 
Who 
would 

have thought any of us would 
enjoy him crooning “L-O-V-
EEEEEEE” over a chopped and 
screwed beat? But it works, and 
it’s beautiful. “A wise man once 
told me nothing” is one of the 
most profound insights I’ve 
heard in a while. Damn.

3. “Check”
Behind “Can’t Tell,” this 

is 
unarguably 
the 
most 

commercially successful song 
on Barter 6. Maybe because 
it’s one of the safest efforts 
on the album. Maybe because 
the repetitive hook (“Got me a 
check, I got a check”) is catchy 
as fuck. Or maybe because it 
features this series of lines: 
“No, they won’t tease on that 
dick / They won’t read on that 
dick, they won’t leash on that 
dick / Don’t Felicia that dick, 
Mamacita that dick / They 
gon’ snitch on that dick/And 
she screamin’ loud, she can’t 
secret that dick / Mama a beast 
on that dick.” Whatever the 
reason, this is the song you 
should show someone when 
you’re introducing them to 
Young Thug.

2. “Best Friend” 
I felt incredibly tempted 

to give “Best Friend” the 
number one spot on this list, 
just because I can’t go a day 
without playing it. The sound 
of 
soothing 
strings 
being 

plucked begins the song and 
then ushers it into a cacophony 
of other noises that serve to 
both shock and satisfy you. 
They build and build and build 
… and never really resolve. But 
that’s classic Thugger; we’re 
never going to make sense of 
him or his sound. And do we 
really want to?

1. “Halftime”
Despite its release in early 

2015, this track is a culmination 
of 
Young 
Thug’s 
entire 

year. Following legal issues 
surrounding his album’s title 
— he tried to take the name 
Carter 6 from Lil Wayne — and 
press scrutiny surrounding his 
sexuality — he’s often seen cross 
dressing — Thug assures us all he 
knows exactly what he’s doing. 
He doesn’t give a shit about the 
beef with Wayne (“Got 100 mil 
flat like my motherfucking idol 
/ I might eat it, I might lick it, 
but I swear I’ll never bite ‘em”) 
and acknowledges his own 
heavy influence on pop culture 
(“Every time I dress myself it 
goes mother fucking viral”). 
And it features some of the 
most interesting production 
and the most powerful rapping 
on Barter 6. The beat keeps 
changing and his flow keeps 
switching; I can’t follow either. 
He doesn’t stop for air, and 
we don’t want him to. I could 
listen to him rap forever.

TV REVIEW
An ‘Ex’-cellent 
mid-season finale 

‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ 
goes into the holidays 

on a high note

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Since the premiere of “Crazy 

Ex-Girlfriend” ’s premiere on the 
CW back in October, star Rachel 
Bloom (“Robot 
Chicken”) 
has 
consis-

tently 
proved 

her knack for 
singing, writ-
ing and act-
ing in one of 
this year’s best 
new shows. By 
infusing witty 
original songs 
into its musical comedy genre, 
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” explores 
the imaginative mind of Bloom’s 
character, Rebecca Bunch. So 
far in the first season, Rebecca 
has grown from an unhappy, 
overworked New York lawyer 
into a more emotionally involved 
character in West Covina, Calif. 
She clearly still denies many of 
her actions, constantly repress-
ing how she moved to the West 
Coast just to be with her high 
school summer fling Josh Chan 
(Vincent Rodriguez III, “Hostag-
es”). Regardless of her motives, 
Rebecca’s underlying neurosis 
and her quest for happiness builds 
a strong foundation within the 
show. This past week’s mid-sea-
son finale, “My Mom, Greg’s Mom 
and Josh’s Sweet Dance Moves!” 
feeds viewers another round of 
strong 
character 
development 

and musical numbers in a typi-
cally pleasant fashion. 

The holiday theme of the epi-

sode plays out nicely, but for 
Rebecca and Co., the holidays are 
far from nice: Rebecca receives a 
visit from her domineering single 
mother (Tovah Feldshuh, “Flesh 
and Bone”) for Hanukkah, in 

hopes of mending the boiling ten-
sion between the two; Greg (San-
tino Fontana, “Frozen”) dreads 
spending time with his mother 
(Mel Harris, “Thirtysomething”), 
who left him and his dad when 
Greg was young; Josh yearns 
for the glory days of being a kid 
at Christmas (who wouldn’t?). 
While these characters cope with 
their problems during The Most 
Wonderful Time of the Year, 
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” showcases 
their situations as a vehicle for 
their growing self-awareness.

Since 
the 
pilot, 
Rebecca’s 

strained relationship with her 
mother has been slowly building 
to a climax — their tense interac-
tions only shown through flash-
backs, a phone call and a brief 
FaceTime chat. But now that 
Rebecca’s mother makes a com-
plete appearance, we see their 
dynamic in action. In her first 
grand entrance, Mrs. Bunch belts 
out the episode’s first musical 
number “Where’s the Bathroom?” 
where she makes rapid-fire cri-
tiques about Rebecca’s home, 
taunts her physical appearance 
and inquires about her sexual 
orientation. Through her fast-
paced delivery, Mrs. Bunch’s 
overbearing 
personality 
and 

critical behavior toward Rebecca 
become evident, and the song 
clearly reflects Rebecca’s harsh 
upbringing.

Following Mrs. Bunch’s formal 

introduction, Rebecca does every-
thing she can to impress her dis-
paraging mother. She lies about 
how she works at a refined law 
firm and how her best friend is a 
stuffy British woman, played by 
Rebecca’s actual best friend and 
confidant Paula (Donna Lynne 
Champlin, “The Good Wife”). 
Though Rebecca’s “mom-pleaser” 
attitude may be a gag in the epi-
sode, her constant attempts to 
win her mother’s approval unveils 
a deeper, much more psychologi-
cally troubling truth. Coupled 
with her depression, Rebecca 
might be tackling reactive attach-
ment disorder. Rebecca explic-

itly admits to her “mom-pleasing” 
ways, yet she perpetually lies to 
her mother about her work life 
and friendships simply because 
she still aches for the approval she 
has always wanted.

In contrast to Rebecca, Greg 

embodies the opposite — a “mom-
hater,” if you will. He reluctantly 
goes to visit his mother, whom 
he calls by her first name “Shaw-
na” and brings along Rebecca’s 
neighbor 
Heather 
(newcomer 

Vella Lovell) for support. Much to 
Heather’s surprise and Greg’s dis-
may, Shawna and her “privileged” 
family are genuinely welcoming 
people. But instead of acknowledg-
ing how thoughtful and caring his 
mother is, Greg continues to resent 
her, solely because she aban-
doned him and his father. Greg 
has too much pride in recognizing 
his mother’s kindness, whereas 
Rebecca has too much anxiety in 
overcoming her mother’s coldness.

Of course, Rebecca and Greg 

eventually learn from their mis-
takes; Greg accepts his mom and 
her generosity to spend time with 
him and Rebecca accepts her mom 
as well, though she still doesn’t 
see how her mother continues 
to deprive her of happiness. The 
only small flaw within the mid-
season finale is Josh’s subplot. It’s 
oddly short and primarily used to 
connect with the last sequence of 
the episode: Josh’s yearning to 
celebrate Christmas as a kid is 
fulfilled when he rejoins his old 
high school breakdancing crew 
at West Covina’s annual Winter 
Wonderland event. This, howev-
er, leads into the second musical 
number, “California Christmas-
time,” which is equally hilarious, 
campy and clever.

After eight spectacular epi-

sodes, 
“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 

ends its mid-season finale on a 
high note. Though it isn’t the 
best of the season, it deftly ties 
together three subplots, two 
refreshing musical numbers and 
one charming protagonist — 
making for an overall emotion-
ally satisfying episode.

TV REVIEW
Average ‘Superstore’

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

NBC’s new workplace com-

edy “Superstore” is a revealing 
portrait of the monotony of daily 
life. It illus-
trates the frus-
trations of an 
unsatisfyingly 
dull job, love 
and 
human 

desire — well, 
as much as a 
sitcom 
about 

a motley crew 
of employees working at a spoof 
of Walmart can. Justin Spitzer’s 
(“The Office”) new series fol-
lows a band of offbeat employ-
ees with Amy (America Ferrera, 
“Ugly Betty”) at the helm. Fer-
rera’s endearing performance of 
the shrewd, yet dispassionate, 
Amy is reason enough to watch 
the show, but leaves us wanting 
more from the plot itself. 

Though the setting of a 

large retail chain leaves little 
room for original content (how 
many packages of toilet paper 
can the new guy knock over?), 
the show revels in the tedious 
duties and individual traits of 
its characters. Even something 
as simple as Cheyenne (Nicole 
Bloom, “Project X”), a young, 
pregnant employee attempting 
to pick up a box, is shown face-
tiously. Jonah (Ben Feldman, 
“Mad Men”), the well-meaning 
yet blundering new guy who 
quickly (and predictably) devel-
ops a crush on Amy, resorts to 
stacking soda cans in the image 
of a smiley face to impress her. 
Ferrera easily takes on her role 
as the unamused and seasoned 
floor manager, with no shortage 
of thinly veiled sarcasm to dole 
out to unwitting Jonah.

A 
playful 
back-and-forth 

commences between Jonah and 
Amy when he mistakes her for 
a customer and unintentionally 
insinuates that the employees at 
the store are beneath him, say-
ing, “I know I don’t seem like the 
type of person who would work 
at a place like this” (at which 
point Amy looks over at Chey-
enne struggling with the box). 
Amy feigns surprise and sarcas-
tically says, “Oh no, I wouldn’t 
want to sound condescending,” 
when Jonah reprimands her for 
restating what he’d just said. 
This 
magnificently 
awkward 

interaction is then tarnished by 
a slapstick routine where Jonah 
attempts to lean against a moun-
tain of bulk toilet paper rolls 
and falls over, bringing them all 
down with him.

Jonah’s 
unfortunate 
gaffe 

leads to him spending the rest 
of the episode trying to get into 
Amy’s good graces. But he acci-
dentally misprices all the elec-
tronics and creates chaos among 
the store’s shoppers. The con-
trast between Amy and Jonah 
shines as Jonah uselessly pleads 
with an old man not to buy a 
mispriced item, and Amy chases 
a woman who leaves the store 
only to end up in a physical alter-
cation with her.

Hilarity ensues as one employ-

ee Garrett (Colton Dunn, “Key 
and Peele”) encourages custom-
ers over the speaker system to 
take advantage of the mistake. 
The security guard panics, and 
then it all abruptly ends when 
another employee, Dina (Lauren 
Ash, “Lars and the Real Girl”), 
marches in front of the crowd 
with a rifle. Dina’s dramatic 
response exemplifies her rough-
around-the-edges, but emotion-
ally vulnerable, characterization 
that is made even funnier by her 
crush on Jonah. Dina is just one 

of the many characters adding 
range to a plot that seems lost in 
its effort to center on the poten-
tial for comedy in a boring work-
place.

Glenn (Mark McKinney, “Sat-

urday Night Live”), the store 
manager, exudes a nauseating 
optimism, like a father with no 
authority trying to make his kids 
think he’s cool. His exuberance 
makes him an easy target for 
manipulation by his employees, 
creating an amusing dynam-
ic, but automatically relegat-
ing him to the sidelines of the 
plot. The potential for romance 
between Amy and Jonah pushes 
any chance the other characters 
stand of having a quality role to 
the plot’s periphery. Even Amy, 
who goes by the name Ramona at 
work to avoid mixing her person-
al life and work life, loses some 
of her complexity. In his efforts 
to impress her, Jonah, and the 
possibility of romance between 
the two, overshadows Ferrera’s 
character — effectively mini-
mizing one of the few strengths 
the show has.

Even in a plot as static as its 

characters’ 
workplace, 
there 

are a few amusing moments that 
merit praise. Overall, the show 
reproduces an atmosphere of 
monotony inherent to its set-
ting. Though Jonah tries to show 
Amy “moments of beauty” in 
their world of daily annoyances, 
the show itself struggles to find 
its own “moments of beauty.” In 
an effort to meld comedy with 
some sort of a deeper statement 
about finding joy in the hum-
drum of day-to-day life, “Super-
store” misses the mark. But 
with America Ferrera leading a 
solid cast and with some well-
written dialogue, the show has 
potential. Just don’t expect it to 
be the next “Office.”

TV REVIEW
Improving ‘Gotham’

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“What the hell?” asks Jim 

Gordon (Ben McKenzie, “South-
land”), waking up to the sight of 
Oswald 
Cob-

blepot 
(Robin 

Lord 
Taylor, 

“The 
Walk-

ing 
Dead”) 

and 
Edward 

Nygma 
(Cory 

Michael Smith, 
“Carol”) 
sing-

ing 
together. 

In many ways, this reaction of 
disbelief sums up my thoughts 
on “Gotham” ’s second season. 
The show is insane, many times 
edging into headshaking ridicu-
lousness, but there are moments 
where it becomes ridiculously 
entertaining, against anyone’s 
better judgment.

One of the biggest issues 

“Gotham” had in its first sea-
son was a failure to commit to a 
specific tone. As it tried to bal-
ance a gritty police procedural 
with over-the-top supervillain 
antics, “Gotham” became a 
muddled mess. However, in its 
second season, the series com-
mitted to the more exagger-
ated reality of its comic book 
origins while maintaining dark-
er moments.

“Gotham” is still a mess, but 

at least now it’s a mess with 
some direction. Abandoning the 
incredibly dull (and often lazy) 
procedural aspects of its inau-
gural season, “Gotham” became 
far more serialized. Its sopho-
more attempt focuses on the 
vengeful machinations of the 
Galavan siblings, Theo (James 
Frain, “True Detective”) and 
Tabitha (Jessica Lucas, “Evil 
Dead”), against Bruce Wayne 
(David Mazouz, “Touch”).

Issues like shallow charac-

ters continue to prevent several 
storylines from ever really dis-
tinguishing themselves. Theo 
never rose above his one-track 
mind for vengeance and became 
a relatively dull villain, even 
though Frain embraced the more 
flamboyant aspect of the show. 
Another new character, Captain 
Nathaniel Barnes (Michael Chik-
lis, “The Shield”), became a tradi-
tional incorruptible cop and not 
much else. Again, the strength of 
Chiklis’s acting elevated aspects 

of the character — but, like so 
many “Gotham” characters, he 
remained as flat as the comic 
pages 
that 
“Gotham” 
draws 

inspirations.

The lack of character develop-

ment in places is a real shame, 
considering 
the 
incredible 

amount of depth and development 
that comprises the extensive Bat-
man mythos on paper and film. 
Again, a lot of these issues spawn 
from “Gotham’’ ’s tendency to not 
commit. Characters always walk a 
line but hardly ever cross it. They 
appear to be locked in perilous per-
sonal crises until the writers acqui-
esce and pull them away from the 
edge.

Thankfully, the series at least 

makes some commitment in its 
finale with Gordon. “Gotham” has 
always hinted at Gordon needing 
to embrace a dark side in order to 
bring justice to the city he wants to 
protect. His twisted relationship 
with Cobblepot has been the main 
personification of this idea, as 
the two occasionally trade favors 
with each. Gordon’s willingness 
to dirty his hands contrasts with 
“Gotham” ’s earlier episodes when 
the show always stopped him 
from going too far instead of actu-
ally testing the metal of its usually 
righteous protagonist.

This time, “Gotham” ensures 

that Gordon will go all the way to 
stop Galavan. “You keep trying to 
kill yourself,” says Gordon’s girl-
friend Leslie Thompkins (More-
na Baccarin, “Homeland”) as he 
prepares to join his few allies and 
Cobblepot’s thugs in an attempt 
to rescue Bruce. By having Gor-
don fully enter into an uneasy 
alliance with the future Penguin, 
the show finally puts Gordon at 
risk of losing his moral responsi-
bility — something that becomes 
all too apparent in the episode’s 
final minutes.

“Gotham” still has some major 

problems, from characterization 
to absurd plot movements, but at 
least the ship has righted itself 
to a degree. The after-credits 
teaser again displays concerns 
about the shows ability to com-
mit to major moves, including 
character deaths, but only time 
will tell if “Gotham” is on the 
right course or steering straight 
into an iceberg.

A look back at Michigan’s 

milestone win in 2001

By BOB HUNT

Daily Sports Alumnus

Editor’s Note: In honor of the 

150th year of Michigan athletics, 
the Daily looks back at what it 
was like to cover the first women’s 
team national championship in 
Michigan history. Bob Hunt, a 
Daily sports writer from 2001 
to 2005, recalls his experience 
documenting a major milestone in 
Michigan sports.

When I was just a freshman 

living in Alice Lloyd Hall in the 
fall of 2001, one of the things 
that amazed me the most about 
the University of Michigan was 
the passion for success its people 
have in literally everything it 
does. Things that I didn’t know 
existed before I got there — such 
as solar car racing or Indian 
dance festivals — have entire 
communities of people within 
the University working to be 
the best at an incredibly diverse 
set of pursuits. While it may 
sound hokey at best or arrogant 
at worst to outsiders, students 
and faculty at Michigan really 
believe they are working to be 
“Leaders and Best.”

So 
when 
Michigan 
won 

the 2001 NCAA Field Hockey 
Championship, 
giving 
the 

University its first national title 
in a women’s sport, the feeling 
on campus was more of surprise 
than anything else. There was 
surprise that, given all of the 
University’s athletic success, this 
was something that had never 
happened before.

Having written a little in high 

school and looking for ways to get 
involved on campus, I went into 
the Student Publications Building 
on Maynard Street and joined the 
Daily’s sports staff during my first 
week in Ann Arbor. I had written 

a few cross country articles when 
the editors said they needed 
someone to help with field hockey. 
However, other than seeing the 
goofy-looking sticks around high 
school, I knew close to nothing 
about the sport. Little did I know 
I would witness history in my first 
semester on campus.

At the time, a title run would 

have also been a surprise to 
anyone outside the program. 
Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 

Wolverines 
had 
made 
the 

national championship game two 
years prior, they had lost three of 
their last seven games going into 
the NCAA Tournament. When 
Michigan lost 3-0 to Ohio State 
in the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
things 
were 

looking bleak.

However, 

even from the 
limited time I 
had spent with 
the 
team, 
I 

could tell that 
the Wolverines 
still 
had 

confidence 
in 

themselves and liked playing with 
each other. Also, due to various 
NCAA rules, Michigan got to host 
an NCAA regional despite not 
being a top seed. The Wolverines 
began the tournament in Ann 
Arbor, facing North Carolina, 
which had made the Final Four 
in 12 of the previous 15 years. 
Michigan upset North Carolina 
and then beat Michigan State in 
overtime (a game in which the 
Spartans appeared to take the lead 
but had a goal overturned). All of 
a sudden, the team was headed to 
Kent, Ohio for the NCAA Final 
Four. 

The Wolverines continued 

that 
momentum 
into 
a 

championship game against top-
ranked Maryland. Despite not 
having the run of play for most 
of the game, Michigan stunned 
the crowd by taking a 2-0 lead 
early in the second half and 
never looked back. What seemed 
unlikely just a couple weeks 
earlier was now reality.

While everyone around the 

team and at the Daily at the time 
knew history had just been made, 
as much emphasis as possible was 
put forth by the department on 
declaring it a great achievement 
for the University, women or 
men. Michigan had already seen 
a great deal of recent success in 
softball and women’s gymnastics, 

which is why 
it 
was 
such 

a 
surprise 

around 
campus 
that 

this was the 
first 
women’s 

title. 
From 

the 
team’s 

perspective, 
however, they 
were excited to 
represent 
the 

school, sports or otherwise.

For me, it started a four-year 

journey working at the Daily, 
which ended up being one of 
the best jobs I’ll ever have. I 
later went on to cover a hockey 
Frozen Four, a men’s basketball 
NIT 
Championship 
and 
the 

Rose Bowl. Even though I left 
writing after school, I made many 
friendships I still maintain today. 
For that, I guess I have to thank, 
in part, field hockey coach Marcia 
Pankratz and her team for that 
sunny Sunday afternoon in Ohio 
back in 2001. However, I like to 
look back on it as just another 
great event to happen to a pretty 
great University.

‘M’ faces test at SMU

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

After Tuesday, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team will have 
played seven games in 19 days: 
Two 
in 
Ann 

Arbor, one in 
North Carolina, 
one in Texas 
and three in the 
Bahamas.

The 

Wolverines 
(6-2) 
are 

suffering 
from 
a 
pair 

of 
backcourt 

health 
issues 

already, 
but 

they’ll soon get 
the chance for 
some rest and recuperation with 
a four-game home stand against 
so-called “guarantee” opponents 
like Delaware State and Bryant.

One non-conference obstacle 

remains, however, before that 
stretch: Tuesday’s trip to No. 19 
Southern Methodist.

The Mustangs have charged out 

to a 6-0 start despite the NCAA’s 
September announcement that 
head coach Larry Brown was 
suspended nine games for a 
lack of program control, among 
other reasons. The sanctions 
stem from violations related to 
academic fraud and “unethical 
conduct” and also preclude SMU 
from participation in the 2016 
postseason.

Nonetheless, five Mustangs are 

averaging double-figure scoring 
totals, and as has been the case 
in each of Michigan’s losses this 
year, they pose a major threat 
size-wise on the glass.

Beilein acknowledged Monday 

that his big men will once again 
have their hands full in terms 
of rebounding. In particular, 
he marveled at SMU’s Jordan 
Tolbert, who is averaging eight 
rebounds despite having started 
just two games.

“Four offensive rebounds a 

game,” Beilein said. “I’ve never 
seen that.”

Beilein has, however, seen the 

Mustangs — they beat Michigan 
last year at Crisler Center to 
cap the Wolverines’ four-game 
December losing streak. The 
62-51 loss came on the heels of 
losses to New Jersey Institute 
of 
Technology 
and 
Eastern 

Michigan, and a 27-point blowout 
at then-No. 3 Arizona.

This time, Michigan enters the 

game coming off four consecutive 
wins but will have to overcome 
the absence of junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. to keep the 
streak alive.

Walton’s 
status 
remains 

questionable with what Beilein 
referred to as a lateral ankle 
sprain, which he sustained last 
week in the first half of Michigan’s 
66-59 win at North Carolina State.

“We tried a little bit (Sunday),” 

Beilein said. “He wasn’t able to go. 
… If he does try and play and he 

can’t do it, he’s got to come out.

“Let’s see what it is,” Beilein 

said. “It’s a very tender area of 
your body, and you also want to 
make sure that you don’t hurt him 
for down the road. An ankle injury 
will plague you all year long if you 
don’t allow it to heal.”

On paper, the SMU matchup 

looks to be among the Wolverines’ 
three 
most 
important 
non-

conference games, alongside their 
Battle 4 Atlantis matchup against 
then-No. 19 Connecticut and their 
Nov. 20 loss to Xavier, which now 
clocks in at No. 10 in the AP Top 25.

While SMU is undefeated, 

some have questioned the quality 
of its opposition so far — the 
Mustangs’ best win is likely an 
85-70 victory at Stanford on Nov. 
19. And while Michigan’s Aubrey 
Dawkins has yet ask his father, 
Stanford coach Johnny Dawkins, 
for a scouting report, he knows 
there’s still time.

“That’s a good idea,” Aubrey 

Dawkins said. “I should.”

Five Things We Learned

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team lost its first 
game of the season Sunday, 
failing to achieve what would 
have been a historic 8-0 start.

The Wolverines’ record fell to 

7-1 after they played outside of 
Michigan for the first time this 
year. It never really looked like 
the Wolverines had a chance 
to redeem last year’s loss to 
Princeton. Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said the team was 
playing “catch up” from the 
opening tip. Despite another 
scoring frenzy from sophomore 
guard Katelynn Flaherty, the 
Wolverines couldn’t come out 
with a win. 

Here are five things we 

learned from Michigan’s first 
loss of the season.

1. Turnovers are a problem…

Barnes Arico mentioned how 

the team looked “really young” 
against Princeton, referencing 
the 22 turnovers. Freshman 
guard Boogie Brozoski and 
Flaherty share the team lead 21 
giveaways each. Brozoski had 
just three on Sunday, but each of 
them seemed unnecessary. She 
is known to thread the needle, 
making flashy, artful assists 
that find teammates all around 
the court, but she may have 
tried to do that a little too much 
this weekend. 

Along with Brozoski, junior 

guard Siera Thompson had a 
team-high five turnovers. Every 
Wolverine besides senior forward 
Kelsey Mitchell, who played for 
just five minutes, registered at 
least one turnover. Princeton 
scored 19 points off them.

2. … But rebounds have not been.

The rebounding gap left by 

three former seniors, Cyesha 
Goree, 
Shannon 
Smith 
and 

Nicole Elmblad, appeared too 
big to make up at the start of 
the season. The trio accounted 
for nearly 60 percent of the 
Wolverines’ total rebounds last 

year. But with the addition of 
freshman center Hallie Thome, 
the entire team is stepping up on 
the glass.

Thome, at 6-foot-5, isn’t even 

leading the team in rebounds. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston has 54, and four other 
players average at least four 
per game. Unlike last year, the 
team hasn’t had to rely on a “Big 
Three” to get the majority of the 
rebounds. Michigan didn’t beat 
Princeton in most categories, 
but it did come out on top in the 
rebounding department, 35-31.

3. Thome’s height isn’t as 

dominant as it looks.

As one of the tallest centers 

in women’s basketball, Thome 
is going to stand out. Up until 
Sunday, nobody could find an 
answer for Michigan’s newest 
weapon. All Thome had to do 
to lead the country in field-goal 
percentage through her first six 
college games was put her hands 
up where no one else could 
reach, catch, make a post move 
and finish.

Princeton’s 
frontcourt, 

though, was made up of two 
seniors: Annie Tarakchian and 
Alex Wheatley. The pair held 
Thome to just three points, 
her 
worst 
performance 
yet. 

Wheatley and Tarakchian were 
both stronger than Thome, and 
physicality was the difference 
maker. There won’t be many 
opponents, even in the Big Ten 
season, that can match Thome’s 
height, but if they can play more 
physically, they might be able to 
win the post battle.

4. Michigan is better than last 

year.

It’s hard to guess how much 

better the 2015-16 team is, but 
the 17-point loss to the Tigers 
was far better than the year 
before. In 2014, Princeton and 
Pittsburgh beat Michigan by 
30 and 19, respectively. The 
Wolverines beat Pitt by 37 on 
Thursday.

The 
aforementioned 

graduated seniors left plenty of 
gaps, but new faces are making 
big improvements. Dunston and 
Thompson are both taking on 
bigger roles. Three different 

freshmen — Thome, Brozoski 
and guard Nicole Munger — are 
all getting significant minutes, 
surprising Barnes Arico with 
their contributions. 

5. BOLD PREDICTION: 

Flaherty will set Michigan’s 
single-season scoring record.

The Wolverines’ star player 

is averaging 21.3 points per 
game through the opening eight 
games of the season. Flaherty set 
her career high with 34 against 
USC Upstate, and she missed 
that tally by only one against 
Princeton. 
The 
sophomore 

already holds the No. 9 spot on 
the list with 499 in her freshman 
year, and she’s on pace to beat 
that by a landslide.

Odds are Flaherty won’t be 

tossing up too many 30-point 
outings once the Big Ten season 
begins, but she has already 
scored 170 points this year. 
Jennifer Smith set the record 
of 659 points in the 2003-04 
season. There are 21 games left 
in the regular season, and if 
Flaherty keeps it up, she won’t 
be too far from it.

Boo Nieves dishes 
on Berenson, more

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

During the 2011-12 hockey 

season, the Daily hockey beat ran 
a video series called “Quick Hits.” 
The videos comprised of one-on-
one interviews with the hockey 
players, which included talking 
about anything and everything.

At the urging of the old beat 

writers, the Daily is bringing back 
Quick Hits — this time in written 
form.

For the first edition, the Daily 

sat down with senior forward Boo 
Nieves, who has three goals and 
six assists this season, to discuss 
his year, Michigan coach Red 
Berenson, E. coli and more.

TMD: How would you evaluate 

your season thus far?

Nieves: It got off to a good 

start and then it got frustrating 
with that concussion. I think I’ve 
come back a 
bit 
stronger, 

and I’m slowly 
getting back to 
my game.

TMD: 
Do 

you think this 
is an NCAA 
Tournament 
team?

Nieves: Absolutely. I think 

this past weekend, we showed 
resilience. Yeah, we let up a lot of 
goals, but I think the fact that we 
can comeback both games, both 
nights, and have contributions 
from all different lines and 
players was definitely a sign of an 
NCAA team.

TMD: What is your most 

memorable 
interaction 
with 

Red Berenson?

Nieves: 
Probably 
when 

we were doing double-downs 
(conditioning) 
and 
(junior 

defenseman) Michael Downing 
started taking pucks out of the 
net so we could do 3-on-1s instead 
of doing conditioning skating. I’ve 
never seen Red smile so much in 
my entire life.

TMD: What was the worst part 

of living with (senior forward) 
Justin Selman in the dorms?

Nieves: 
He 
never 
does 

anything he doesn’t want to do. 
Like if he doesn’t want to clean up, 
he just doesn’t do it. If he doesn’t 
want to go grab the laundry, he 
just doesn’t do it. He’s very lazy.

TMD: 
Describe 
(junior 

forward) Max Shuart.

Nieves: 
Shuart. 
He’s 
a 

character. He’ll make you laugh 
even when you’re in a bad mood. 
He can always put a smile on your 
face. He’s the jokester on the team 
and keeps everyone’s spirits high.

TMD: Who’d win a fight: 

Shuart or Downing?

Nieves: 
Prison 
rules? 

Downing. In a civilized fight, 
probably Shuart.

TMD: Who has the strangest 

pregame routine?

Nieves: 
Steve 
Racine 
or 

Nolan De Jong. They are here so 
early and just doing a little bit of 
everything.

TMD: 

You’re a music 
major. Who is 
the best singer 
on the team?

Nieves: 

Cooper 
Marody. 
No 

question.

TMD: How annoying is (junior 

forward) JT Compher to practice 
against?

Nieves: Oh my God (Laughs).
TMD: What’s your go-to meal 

in Ann Arbor?

Nieves: Chipotle.
TMD: Even with E. coli?
Nieves: 
Yeah, 
I 
probably 

shouldn’t have said that. Probably 
Babo then.

TMD: Apparently you used 

to eat Zebra cakes, Swiss rolls 
and drink Arnold Palmer before 
games. What is that about?

Nieves: My old roommate Ryan 

Rosenthal is actually buddies with 
(Selman) from home, and he and I 
had a ritual before games (at Prep 
School). We did that one game, 
and it took off from there so we 
had to keep doing it.

TMD: That can’t be healthy…
Nieves: It was usually the 

night before games (laughs). 

“I’ve come back 
a bit stronger.”

Glasgow, Bolden 

still not over 

season-ending loss 

to Ohio State

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

It’s been over a week since the 

Michigan football team ended 
its regular season on the sourest 
possible note. And while the 
Wolverines have had time for 
their bodies to recover, they still 
haven’t fully healed from the 
42-13 beating Ohio State handed 
them.

There is a silver lining: No. 

14 Michigan was invited to play 
Florida in the Buffalo Wild 
Wings Citrus Bowl on New 
Year’s Day. But in advance of the 
bowl game, senior linebacker 
Joe Bolden opened up about 
the emotions surrounding their 
regular-season-ending loss.

“To be 100 percent honest, 

I’m not over either one of the 
losses (to Michigan State or 
Ohio State),” Bolden said. “It’s 
just crazy to think about. I guess 
in a way, both us and Ohio State 
were that close to finishing 
Michigan State, and it’s not 
something that we’re happy 
about. Or, at least I can speak 
for myself, it’s not something 
I’m happy about.

“I think it’s a good opportunity 

that we have with the Citrus 
Bowl, and with a solid opponent 
in Florida to end the season on a 
good note and get these guys and 
get everybody rolling into next 
year.”

After 
hearing 
Bolden’s 

comments, 
fifth-year 
senior 

center Graham Glasgow leaned 
forward 
and 
cosigned 
his 

statement.

“For the record, I am also not 

happy about those two losses,” 
he said.

The Buckeyes scored more 

points on the Wolverines than 
any other team this season — 42, 

one more than Indiana’s 41 in a 
double-overtime Michigan win 
— and likely kept Michigan from 
making a New Year’s Six bowl in 
Jim Harbaugh’s first season as 
coach.

And other than the 29-point 

blowout, the Wolverines were 
in both of their other losses this 
season. 
They 

lost by seven at 
Utah in Week 
1, and were one 
miraculous 
fumbled 
punt 
away 

from 
beating 

Michigan 
State.

“I 
think, 

really, 
the 

common 
factor when you look at all three 
of our losses this year is not 
tackling,” Bolden said.

That was certainly the case 

against the Buckeyes, as J.T. 
Barrett 
and 
Ezekiel 
Elliott 

perfectly executed the read-
option offense. The game turned 

into a blowout in the second 
half, making Michigan’s final 
loss of the season the most 
excruciating. It was the last 
game the Wolverines’ seniors 
played at Michigan Stadium.

“It was pretty emotional for 

me, just like seeing my teammates 
in (Michigan Stadium) for the 

last time, and 
being 
with 

Kyle 
and 

the 
O-line, 

we have our 
own 
little 

nook 
in 
the 

locker 
room 

where we all 
sit 
together,” 

Glasgow said. 
“It was pretty 
emotional. 

Never want to go out like that, 
and that probably added to it, 
and it is something that we’re 
trying to get over, something 
that I’m trying to get over by 
winning the last game.”

Added Bolden: “It’s hard to 

describe, especially the way it 

happened. … We got our butts 
kicked — there’s no ifs, ands or 
buts about it. And it’s just hard 
to fathom, you come in, and you 
remember the exact time you 
first put the uniform on, and 
you button your chinstrap on 
the helmet, and it’s just hard to 
fathom that that was the last 
game here in front of the home 
fans that we love so dearly.”

But while it’s understandable 

that Glasgow, Bolden and every 
other Wolverine senior would 
be torn up after losing to Ohio 
State for the fourth consecutive 
year, they were also able to keep 
a sense of perspective about the 
direction of the program under 
coach Jim Harbaugh.

“I think that this program is 

rising very quickly, and I think 
that it could (compete for a Big 
Ten title) as soon as next year,” 
Glasgow said. “I think that 
the guys that we’re losing are 
going to be replaced by more 
than capable and able guys, and 
talented guys, and I think that 
they’ll be a good team next year.”

Butt torn on draft plans

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Michigan junior tight end 

Jake Butt said Monday that he’s 
considering foregoing his senior 
season and entering the NFL 
Draft.

Butt, who was named the Big 

Ten Tight of the Year last week, 
said his decision will come in the 
near future, likely “in the next 
week or so.” As of now, Butt is 
50-50 on his decision. He recently 
made a pros and cons list with 
his father, he said, and staying at 
Michigan and going to the NFL 
had arguments on each side.

Before 
he 
makes 
up 
his 

mind, Butt plans to seek advice 
from 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh. Butt plans to rely 
heavily on Harbaugh and the 
rest 
of 
Michigan’s 
coaching 

staff in regard to this upcoming 
decision because of the extensive 
NFL experience many of the 
Wolverines’ coaches have.

“Really, it’s going to come down 

to … a lot of it’s going to be based 
on what Coach Harbaugh says,” 
Butt said.

There are two main reasons 

Butt is considering leaving early. 
The first is that it’s possible that 
his NFL stock will never be higher. 
The second is risk of injury. Butt 
has had knee operations in the 
past, including one for an anterior 
cruciate ligament tear that affected 
him for much of the 2014 season.

Butt said if he didn’t believe 

he would be selected in the first 
three rounds of the draft, he 
would definitely come back to 
Michigan. So far, he has been 
hearing that he would be selected 
within that range after a junior 

campaign in which he caught 48 
passes for 620 yards.

Still, the decision isn’t an 

easy one. Another year with 
the Wolverines could further 
establish Butt as one of the 
greatest tight ends in program 
history, and playing for Harbaugh 
— with his NFL pedigree and 
penchant for developing tight 
ends — could help Butt improve 
even more.

“Coming back, there’s so many 

reasons why I want to come 
back: To try and break some of 
these tight end records, I love 
my roommates, my teammates, 
we haven’t accomplished what 
I came here for as a team to do,” 
Butt said. “That’s beat Michigan 
State, beat Ohio State, win a Big 
Ten championship.”

Butt has spoken to former 

Michigan teammates Jake Ryan, 

Devin 
Funchess 
and 
Taylor 

Lewan about their experiences 
in the NFL. He knows that the 
NFL is a different world, one in 
which the entirety of your focus 
is on football. He compared it 
to Michigan’s intense fall camp 
this season, but he noted with a 
grin that the football this time 
around would come with a “nice 
paycheck.”

Butt had more receptions this 

season than he previously had in 
the rest of his Michigan career 
combined. Coming off a 2014 
season in which he caught 21 
passes for 211 yards, Butt never 
imagined that a breakout year 
could lead to this dilemma.

“It’s still all crazy to me that I 

even have to make this decision,” 
Butt said. “At the beginning of the 
year, it wasn’t even in my vision or 
thoughts.”

Chesson earns 
MVP accolade 
at annual bust

Harbaugh excited 

about team’s 
progress in his 

first season

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

LIVONIA, Mich. — Jehu 

Chesson said Monday afternoon 
that he tends to shy away from 
individual attention, but if the 
95th annual Michigan Football 
Bust is any indication, it isn’t 
working.

In a celebration of the No. 

14 Michigan football team’s 
9-3 season, the redshirt junior 
wide receiver was named the 
Bo Schembechler team MVP for 
the season.

“I’ve 
been 
humbled 
and 

blessed to be around great 
people on a daily basis,” Chesson 
said. “I’ve learned so much, and 
it’s a huge part of why I’m here 
today.”

In 
addition 
to 
Chesson, 

senior tight end Michael Jocz 
was awarded the Dr. Arthur D. 
Robinson Scholarship Award for 
top student-athlete. Jocz boasts 
a 3.97 grade-point average in 
mechanical engineering — the 
highest on the team.

Senior linebacker Desmond 

Morgan won the Roger Zatkoff 
Award as the 
team’s 
top 

linebacker, 
while fellow 
senior 
linebacker 
Joe 
Bolden 

won 
the 

Robert 
P. 

Ufer Bequest 
for 
most 

outstanding 
love 
and 

enthusiasm 
for Michigan.

Redshirt 
juniors 
Chris 

Wormley and Ryan Glasgow 
split the Dick Katcher Award 
for most outstanding defensive 
linemen, while fifth-year senior 
offensive 
lineman 
Graham 

Glasgow won the Hugh R. Rader 
Memorial Award for the team’s 
best lineman.

Chesson’s 
player-selected 

honor comes after a season in 
which he led the team with 801 
yards from scrimmage and 11 
total touchdowns. His biggest 
performance 
came 
against 

Indiana on Nov. 14, when he 
tied a school record with four 
touchdowns and added 207 
receiving yards.

Last week, he was named 

first-team All-Big Ten in the 
coaches’ vote.

Though it was a career season, 

Chesson remains focused on his 
main goal: team success.

“When you ask me about 

individual goals, I don’t really 
have a lot of individual goals,” 
Chesson said Monday afternoon. 
“The team is what really matters 
more. … With that kind of 

mentality, I think that really 
freed up a lot of opportunities 
for me to run down on kickoff, 
to get there on punt return and 
try to pin a guy in, get good 
blocks for Jabrill so he can make 
something happen.”

When asked earlier in the day 

who he voted for, Chesson didn’t 
hesitate to name the player who 
fed him the ball all season — 
fifth-year senior quarterback 
Jake Rudock.

“It’s really important to really 

acknowledge those who support 
you, who are in your corner,” 
Chesson 
said. 
“Without 
a 

quarterback — I mean, it sounds 
so cliché, but literally — without 
the 
decisions 
Jake 
makes 

throughout the game to throw 
me the ball, the O-line holding 
it up, or the defense giving them 
a three-and-out, making them 
punt, and allowing me and the 
offense to come out on the field 
and basically increase our stats, 
if you will.

“It’s all made possible by your 

teammates and your coaches, so 
I’m really thankful for them.”

Prior to the awards, the 

bust celebrated not only the 
2015 team but also the 30th 
anniversary of the 1985 team 
that finished 10-1-1 and No. 2 
in the final polls — the highest 
in former Michigan coach Bo 
Schembechler’s 21 seasons at 
Michigan.

More 
than 

30 members of 
that team were 
in attendance, 
including 
current 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh, 
who was the 
1985 
team’s 

quarterback.

Though 

many consider 

that team to be one of the best 
in modern Michigan history, 
Harbaugh elected to nominate 
this 
year’s 
team 
into 
the 

conversation, factoring in the 
year-to-year improvement over 
total wins.

“The train was moving in the 

wrong direction, and this team 
moved it around on the tracks. 
That’s not easy to do,” Harbaugh 
said.

“(The team) gave it everything 

they had. Not a single complaint. 
I feel like we got our dignity 
back.”

Among those in agreement 

was Harbaugh’s current boss, 
interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett. Speaking just over 13 
months after taking the position 
and a week after announcing 
he would be resigning, Hackett 
noted that at the bust last 
season, he wanted to be able to 
answer one question: “Did we 
get better?”

“I didn’t need a year to realize 

I would feel better about this 
team,” Hackett said. “I knew 
we got better the day I hired 
(Harbaugh).”

Wolverines reflect on tough 
finale ahead of Citrus Bowl

“I’ve learned so 
much, and it’s a 
huge part of why 
I’m here today.”

“It was pretty 

emotional. Never 

want to go out 

like that.”
