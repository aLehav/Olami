Three safety agencies

By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily Staff Reporter
A report released Friday that served
as a catalyst for the reorganization
of major campus security programs
into the new Division of Public Safety
and Security exposed long-term ten-
sions and lack of cooperation between
the University's Department of Public
Safety and the other two major security
agencies on campus, Housing Security
and Hospitals & Health Centers Secu-

Margolis Healy & Associates, a Ver-
mont-based security consulting firm,
was hired by the University's Board of
Regents to conduct a study of the Uni-
versity's security agencies following
the discovery that administrators with-
in the University of Michigan Health
System delayed reporting the alleged
possession of child pornography by for-
mer medical resident Stephen Jenson to
police for six months.
At the regents meeting on Friday
in Flint, the creation of DPSS was for-

Daily StaffReporter
This election cycle, Michigan voters
will have a say in how at-home health
caregivers organize and whether they
have the right to unionize.

Michigan's Proposal 4, set to appear
on the Nov. 6 ballot, recommends estab-
lishing the Michigan Quality Home Care
Council, an organization that would
train in-home care givers, create a regis-
try of verified workers and help patients
in need of financial aid in paying for in-
home health care. The council would also
set conditions for in-home employment
and standards along with terms of com-
pensation for such workers, in addition
to allowing in-home health care workers

Daily News Editor andDaily StaffReporter
For the first time since 2009, the Uni-
versity's endowment decreased in value
from $7.8 billion to $7.7 billion during
_ fiscal year 2012.

At the University's Board of Regents
meeting on Friday at the University's
Flint campus, Regent Katherine White
(D-Ann Arbor) spoke about the Univer-
sity's investment report, and explained
that the endowment decrease can be
attributed to spending patterns.
Additionally, the University's equity
investments, mostly stocks, declined
9.25 percent in value since last year. This
negative trend contrasts with a general
rise in the value of the Dow Jones Indus-
trial Average by about 8 percent between

Daily StaffReporter and Daily News Editor
At the University's Board of Regents
meeting in Flint on Friday, the board

announced the completion of an exter-
nal review of the University of Michi-
gan Health System's six-month delay in
reporting the possession of child por-
nography by former medical resident
Stephen Jenson.
However, the board will not release
the full report to the public. Instead,
the University released a summary of
the board's findings from reading the
report. University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said in an interview that the

University will not release the complete
report, which was prepared by Latham
& Watkins, L.L.P., citing attorney-client
privilege.
"The law firm did send a report to the
Board of Regents, but that work is done
under attorney-client privilege, at the
suggestion of the law firm," Fitzgerald
said. "It was their recommendation that
would give them the broadest latitude
to get to the bottom of things, and we

NEWS BRIEFS
WIXOM, Mich.
Police release
sketch of shooting
spree suspect
Authorities have released a
drawing of a man suspected in
a series of shootings in the past
week over a three-county area of
southeastern Michigan.
Wixom police say in a release
that the sketch was obtained from
a witness to a shooting Thursday
in Ingham County.
That witness also described the
suspect's vehicle as resembling a
dark 1998 Oldsmobile Alero or a
1998 Toyota Camry.
A task force of local and state
police agencies was formed Fri-
day to investigate the 16 or more
shootings in Livingston, Oakland,
and Ingham counties. Most of the
shootings involved cars on busy
roads Tuesday through Thursday.
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif.
Great Gray Owls
to be studied less
disruptively
Scientists working in Yosemite
National Park are eavesdropping
on forest creatures, hoping to gain
a greater understanding of a rare
subspecies of Great Gray Owls.
The raptors number fewer than
200 in and around the park, and
even the slightest human inter-
vention can disrupt their breeding
and feeding cycles.
Scientists are using data-com-
pression digital audio recorders
to capture forests sounds. They
developed software to discern
the low-frequency owl calls from
other noises in an effort to deter-
mine their numbers and rates of
reproduction.
The raptors were cut off from
their plentiful Canadian counter-
parts during the ice age 30,000
years ago. Since then scientists
have been looking for ways to pro-
tect them and better understand
their habitat-specific evolution.
KINSHASA, Congo
Three Catholic
priests abducted
from monastery
Congolese civic leaders say
that three Roman Catholic priests
were kidnapped in eastern Congo.
The three priests were taken
captive from their monastery by
about 10 gunmen Saturday night.
Omar Kavota, the Vice Presi-
dent of the North Kivu civil soci-
ety, said the abductions took place
in Beni, north of Goma, in North
Kivu province.
The three, indentified as Wasu-
kudi Anselm, 41, Jean Ndulani, 52,
and Edmond Kisughu, 53, were
tied up and taken away by the
armed men, who witnesses say
spoke Swahili.
 More than a year ago, in the
same area, Dr. Paluku Mukongo-
ma, medical director of the Gener-
al Hospital Oicha, was kidnapped

and nothing has been heard of him
or of his abductors.
. BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau
Six killed after
attempted military
mutiny attack
Military sources said six people
were killed when a group of Guin-
ean soldiers attempted to seize
control of a military airbase near
the capital, Bissau.
The fighting went on for about
two hours early Sunday before the
mutineers were defeated by mili-
tary loyal to the Chief of General
Staff of the Armed Forces, Antonio
Indjai, said an army officer who
spoke at the military headquarters
on condition of anonymity. There
is no indication if any senior offi-
cers were involved in the uprising.
The apparent attempted coup
was against the military junta that
itself seized power in April.
No leader in nearly 40 years
of independence has finished his
time in office in Guinea-Bissau, a
former Portuguese colony on Afri-
ca's western coast that has long
been plagued by coups.

Wisc. man shoots

Shooter terrorized
mall spa after
slashing wife's tires
BROOKFIELD, Wis. (AP) - A
Wisconsin man who had been
accused of domestic violence
and slashing his wife's tires took
a gun into the spa where she
worked Sunday and shot seven
women, three fatally, before kill-
ing himself, a police chief said.
The shootings set off a con-
fusing, six-hour search for the
gunman that locked down a
nearby mall, a country club
adjacent to the spa and the hos-
pital where the survivors were
taken. The search froze activity
in a commercial area in Brook-
field, a middle-to-upper class
community west of Milwaukee,
for much of the day. Ultimately,
he was found dead in the spa.
Authorities said it would take
time to sort out exactly what
happened, and emphasized they
were still interviewing witness-
es and rescuers and did not have
a firm timeline of events. At a
news conference Sunday night,
Mayor Steve Ponto called the
shootings "a senseless act on
the part of one person."
The chaos started around
11 a.m. at the Azana Day Spa, a
two-story, 9,000-square-foot
building across from a major
shopping mall. The first officers
on the scene found the build-
ing filled with smoke from a fire

authorities believe was set by
the suspect, Radcliffe Franklin
Haughton, 45, of Brown Deer,
Brookfield Police Chief Dan
Tushaus said.
They also found a 1-pound
propane tank they initially
thought might be an improvised
explosive device, Tushhaus
said. That slowed the search of
the building as law enforcement
agents waited for a bomb squad
to clear the scene.
Tushaus said later that police
didn't know whether the gun-
man broughtthe propane tank to
the spa or it was leftby a contrac-
tor.
The search also was com-
plicated by the layout of the
building, with numerous small
treatment rooms and several
locked areas, Tushaus said.
While officers initially thought
the gunman had fled the build-
ing, they later found his body in
one of the locked areas, he said.
The bodies of the victims
were also found in the spa.
Tushaus said investigators were
still working to identify them.
He said the four survivors were
between the ages of 22 and 40.
He didn't know if they were
employees at the spa or custom-
ers, and it wasn't clear if the
man's wife was among the vic-
tims.
Haughton had recently been
arrested after witnesses iden-
tified him as the person who
slashed his wife's tires, police
said.

Citizens act out
against far-left
government's plans
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay
(AP) - Uruguayans used to call
their country the Switzerland
of Latin America, but its faded
grey capital seems a bit more
like Amsterdam now that its
congress has legalized abortion
and is drawing up plans to sell
government-grown marijuana.
Both measures would be
unthinkable in many other
countries. Cuba is the only
other nation in the region that
makes first-trimester abortions
accessible to all women, and no
country in the world produces
and sells pot for drug users to
enjoy.
But President Jose "Pepe"
Mujica, a flower-farming for-
mer leftist guerrilla, vowed
to sign whatever bill congress
could settle on that can mini-
mize the 30,000 illegal abor-
tions his government says
Uruguayan women suffer annu-
ally.
And while lawmakers have
yet to debate pot sales, Mujica's
ruling Broad Front coalition

staked its ground in August by
openly declaring that the drug
war has failed. Smoking pot - if
not growing and selling it - is
already legal in Uruguay, and
supplyingthe weed is a $30 mil-
lion business, the government
said.
This is democracy "a la Uru-
guaya" - the Uruguayan way -
a phrase that reflects both the
pride and the unmet promises
of a society where finding com-
mon ground is a highly shared
value, in stark contrast to many
other countries where voters
are divided by us-and-them
politics.
Such outsized respect for
the democratic process has
enabled the country of 3.4 mil-
lion people wedged between
Argentina and Brazil to reach
consensus on many issues that
have stymied bigger and richer
nations, from reforming health
care to providing free univer-
sity educations, to setting ambi-
tious renewable energy goals.
By embracing compromises,
Uruguay has managed to hold
onto its middle class through
repeated economic crises, and
pass laws that have consistently
improved its citizens' quality of
life.

University should immediately release Jensen report
Jn May 2011, a flash drive allegedly containing child pornography
belonging to then-University of Michigan Health System resident
Stephen Jenson was discovered by a medical resident. The resi-
dent reported the alleged pornography to her supervisor, but UMHS
officials, however, did not report this information to police for six
months. After calling this inaction a "failure," the University launched
an internal investigation of the missteps and also hired an outside
consulting firm to conduct an inquiry. The summary of the external
investigation's was released. If the University learned anything from
the Penn State scandal, they should have released these findings in full
to the public as quickly as possible. While this may be damaging to the
University's reputation in the short-term, it's imperative that students
and the University community have this information.

Say what you meme

The third and final presi-
dential debate will take
place Monday at 7 p.m.
in Boca Raton,
Fla. There is,
of course, one
big question
on everyone's
mind: Which
Romney-
inspired meme
will the Inter- DANIEL
net churn out CHARDELL
next?
First there
was Big Bird.
During the first presidential
debate, former PBS news anchor
Jim Lehrer, asked the candidates
how they would address the federal
budget deficit. Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney said
he would lower government spend-
ing and, even though he loves Big
Bird, end government subsidies for
networks like PBS.
TheupshotofRomney's remarks?
Instant online fame for his yellow,
feathery friend. On Facebook, Red-
dit, Twitter, Tumblr and elsewhere,
memes popped up by the thou-
sands. Superimposed over pictures
of Big Bird were phrases like "Fired
by Romney," "This bird is too big to
fail," "Mitt Romney is trying to kill
me and "Save Big Bird." Another
read, "Obama got bin Laden - I'll
get Big Bird!" under a picture of a
cackling Romney. The Internet had
spoken, but it wasn't finished with
Romney quite yet.
Round two: Binders Full of
Women.
In the second presidential
debate, the candidates were asked
what they would do to address
the gender income gap. President
Barack Obama drew attention to
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of
2009, the first bill passed during
his presidency, and his efforts to
ensure equal access to higher edu-
cation by expanding Pell Grants.
Romney tried to anecdotally
demonstrate his credentials. While
putting together his cabinet as gov-
ernor of Massachusetts, he noticed
that the pool of applicants was
overwhelmingly male. In search
of equally qualified women -
because he's apparently an affirma-
tive action kind of guy - Romney

approached "a number of women's
groups and said, 'Can you help us
find folks?' and they brought us
whole binders full of women."
Look, I'm savvy to the ubiquitous
powers of the Internet, but even I
was surprised at how rapidly "bind-
ers full of women" took off. Before
the debate was over, a "Binders
Full of Women" Tumblr blog had
already gone viral. Submissions
riffed on the image of binders liter-
ally full of women and the implicit
sexism of Romney's statement.
Trapper Keeper? More like, "Trap
Her, Keep Her."
On Facebook, a "Binders Full of
Women" page garnered more than
30,000 "likes" by the end of the
broadcast. (At present, that num-
ber has grown to 354,000.) Over
on Twitter, a "Romney's Binder"
account gave us the binder's perspec-
tive on its newfound fame: "No com-
ment on the rumors that Bill Clinton
has already asked to borrow me."
The Obama and Romney cam-
paigns themselves have been
drawn into the meme-driven dia-
logue. Campaigning in Iowa Oct. 17,
Obama told his audience, "I've got
to tell you, we don't have to collect
a bunch of binders to find qualified,
talented, driven young women to
learn and teach" in science,. tech-
nology, engineering and math.
That same day, the Obama camp
came out with an ad titled "Mitt
Romney's Condescending views
Toward Women," which, against
the backdrop of a three-ring bind-
er graphic, affirms that Romney's
cookie-cutter perception of gender
norms is outdated.
Also on Oct. 17, in a pathetic
attempt to spin the binder contro-
versy in Romney's favor, the Repub-
lican National Committee released
a picture of a binder filled with
blank white pages under the words
"Obama's Second-Term Agenda."
Explaining the image, Reince Prie-
bus, the National Committee chair-
man, said Obama "didn't lay out
a plan for a second term agenda.
He's offered plenty of excuses but
he hasn't offered a plan. And that's
what we're calling the empty bind-
er." (Clever, Reince.)
In any case, out of all that was
said during the second presidential
debate, it remains true that the bind-

ers full of women meme has gener-
ated the most buzz. Is that a bad
thing? Should we be concerned that
voters - particularly young people,
the primary generators of memes -
pay more attention to binders and
Big Bird than the "real" issues?
Memes reflect
the artificiality
of debates.

While most would like to think that the child
abuse scandal at Penn State is an isolated inci-
dent, tragic discoveries like these are made
somewhat frequently. Universities across the
country, however, can learn from this situation
by ensuring offenses are reported to the proper
authorities as quickly as possible.
At the regents' meeting on Friday, the board
announced the completion of an external
review of the UMHS's delay in reporting Jen-
son's alleged possession of child pornography.
Theboardwon'trelease the full external report
- prepared by the law firm Latham & Watkins,
LLP - citing attorney-client privilege. Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said that the
law firm suggested it was best not to immedi-
ately release the audit in full.
While the University's refusal to release
the external report is within their legal pro-
tections due to attorney-client privilege, the
University has a responsibility to inform the
people involved and those who live in the
community of issues that directly affect them.
Furthermore;,the University can release por-

tions of the report without breaching attor-
ney-client privilege, drawing question to the
legitimacy of their decision.
At Penn State, attorney and former FBI
director Louis Freeh released the full results
of an independent review immediately after
its completion. If the details of the University's
delay in reporting Jenson's offense are ostensi-
bly less sordid than those of the Penn State case,
there is no reason for the University to with-
hold the third-party review.
Jenson was in the pediatrics specialty
program, which likely brought him into
direct contact with children on a regular
basis. The delay between the alleged
discovery of child pornography on his flash
drive and his prosecution is disturbing
enough without the University's subsequent
delay in releasing pertinent details as to how
the case was mishandled. Before inviting
further suspicions, the University should
ignore its attorney's recommendation, follow
the precedent set by Louis Freeh and release
the external report immediately.

These questions are legitimate,
but wrongheaded. Those who
attack these memes make two false
presumptions.
First, they assume the candi-
dates and media are discussing the
real issues to begin with - which,
more often than not, they aren't. In
part, that's a reflection of the arti-
ficial structure of these so-called
debates. But it's also attributable to
Romney's pandering and Obama's
reluctance to call attention to his
opponent's blatant insincerity.
Second, they falsely assume
young people are incapable of grap-
pling with the most pressing issues
of the day. That's far from the truth.
Those who are the best informed
create the funniest memes, and only
those who are equally informed
can understand them. My Face-
book friends who shared links to
the "Binders Full of Women" Tum-
blr are far from lazy or ignorant. In
fact, they turn to memes precisely
because, in their scathing irony,
memes are more informative than
any campaign ad or stump speech.
Memes are an outlet for our frustra-
tion with the circus that is politics.
Can memes be misleading? Yes.
Can they oversimplify issues? Yes.
(On both counts, see the "You
Didn't Build That" series.) But until
Romney gets honest, or until these
debates getreal, or both, these things
called memes are here to stay. Let's
see which one goes viral tonight.

Take the lead on Israel-Palestine

RYAN HERBERHOLZ VIEWPOINT
Practicing 'Nobel' politics

4

As an Egyptian, it's nearly impossible to
critically engage in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. In fact, where I'm from, just calling
the conflict "complex" triggers a reaction from
Egyptians who think it's as simple as Israel
being the aggressor and Palestine, the victim.
Earlier this month, Egyptians were com-
memorating the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli
War. In the United States, the accepted narra-
tive of the war is a clear Israeli victory. But in
Egypt, it's remembered as our triumph. About
the time of the anniversary, my newsfeed was
full of patriotic posts praising the Egyptian
military. Far too often, the posts ended up
condemning the very existence of the Israeli
state. This is all despite the fact that the two
states haven't been at war since before my
friends were born.
This is because the old Mubarak regime
used imaginary Israeli plots to divert atten-
tionfrom domestic policyfailures andsilenced
political opposition by labeling them Israeli
clients. Still today, domestic parties vying for
power commonly use anti-Israel rhetoric.
To me, this is an overly simplistic view of
the conflict. I see the destruction of innocent
lives by both Israelis and Palestinians. Despite
the agreed upon cease-fire, rockets still come
from Gaza and target civilians in the southern
parts of Israel. Every day, private land is taken
from Palestinian families to expand Jewish
settlement in the West Bank, despite the gov-
ernment's supposed support of a two-state
solution. There can be no moral high ground
when each side sinks to this level.
I've been studying in the United States for
more than a year, and I've come to learn that
the malicious and selfish politicization of the
conflict isn't confined to Egypt. While some
politicians in Egypt score political points by
aggressively attacking Israel, many American
politicians place all the blame on Palestinians
or focus on Iran's nuclear program.
As a proud member of J Street UMich, I
reject a conversation that places all blame on
Israelis or Palestinians. I reject the unneces-
sary pandering that happens every four years,
leading each party in a race to the bottom of
who can be more hawkish on Israel. I believe
that many Americans understand how crucial
a resolution to this conflict is to American
interests, thus many support active leadership
to resolve it. Yet the issue has hardly been dis-

cussed this election cycle.
Neither presidential candidate has prov-
en themselves on the issue. We've watched
President Barack Obama seem to give up
on pursuing negotiations between Israelis
and Palestinians. We watched Republican
nominee Mitt Romney argue that Palestin-
ians don't want peace, claiming that the best
approach to the conflict is to maintain the sta-
tus quo and "kick the ball down the field and
hope that ultimately, somehow, something
will happen and resolve [itself]" in his now-
infamous "47 percent" speech. That is a senti-
ment unbecoming of a potential world leader.
The final presidential debate is Monday
night, with a focus on foreign policy. There is
no doubt that the Israeli-Palestinian issue will
be brought up. I don't expect either candidate
to be honest about the need for vigorous Amer-
ican leadership to pursue a two-state solution.
I fear that grandstanding around the Iranian
nuclear programwill distract both candidates.
I fear that the finger pointing we'll likely
see in Monday night's debate will not lead us
anywhere except toward more bloodshed.
Individuals and communities that, like me,
support a two-state solution need to become
proactive rather than reactive. That's why J
Street UMich and more than 40 other J Street
U chapters from coast to coast are running
our Two-State Semester Campaign.
We are demonstratingto our political lead-
ers that there's a large and serious constitu-
ency of students who believe in a two-state
solution. We have been collecting signatures
- and will continue to - from individuals and
statements from campus leaders that simply
state: "We support vigorous U.S. diplomatic
leadership to achieve a two-state solution to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
I may not be American, but as a pro-Peace
Arab advocate, I have a stake in the campaign
as well. Two weeks ago, J Street UMich host-
ed U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), who
spoke eloquently about the need for a nego-
tiated two-state solution. I left the conversa-
tion hopeful that some of America's leaders
would be willing to take a lead on this issue
after nearly 100 years of war. As the two-state
campaign grows, I am sure there will be more
leaders like Dingell in Washington, D.C.
Salah El-Prince is an LSA senior.

Out of all the individuals and
organizations that are genuinely
dedicated to creating a peaceful and
just global society, the European
Union was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize. Evenifthe prize wasintended
to be a political award, I would not
rank the EU high on a list of worthy
recipients - one only needs to cast
an eye at Greece to begin question-
ing the validity of this selection.
The unrest in Greece and in Spain
can largely be blamed on the EU's
mishandling of several debt crises.
These financial upsets reek of the
unregulated and simply vampiric
financial practices that Wall Street
churns out to create fortunes from
thin air. Unfortunately, these convo-
luted financial models were export-
ed before the fallacy of Greenspan's
"self-regulating free markets" lit-
erally came tumbling down like a
house of cards.
Another factor that seems to
have been considered when award-
ing the Nobel Peace Prize is armed
conflict. One may think this is
the opposite of peace, but perhaps
the Norwegian Nobel Committee
was thinking of the kind of peace
brought on by war - a philoso-
phy that falls into the oxymoron
category as firmly as the phrase
"humanitarian bombing." This
backward thinking has been exem-
plified by awarding of the prize to
President Barack Obama in 2009
and the subsequent escalation of
the Afghanistan and Iraq wars with
cooperation from the EU, not to
mention the devastation caused by
unmanned drone strikes.
I don't think Alfred Nobel would
agree with this logic. According to
his will, the prize is to be given to
the person who "shall have done
the most or the best work for fra-
ternity between nations, for the
abolition or reduction of standing
armies and for the holding and pro-
motion of peace congresses."
I think the Nobel Prize decision is
a symptom of the same disease that
seems to plague our own country.
We allow institutions to be entrusted
with individuals whose agendas are

influenced by special interests, polit-
ical power and wealth, rather than
their original purposes.
The FDIC was meant - through
regulation and insurance - to pro-
tect from the collapse of financial
institutions, not to be used in com-
bination with massive bailouts as
publicly funded gambling insur-
ance for already filthy rich finan-
ciers. In fact, the entire regulatory
structure created to avert crisis like
the Great Depression is lousy with
individuals from the "too big to
fail" institutions they supposedly
regulate. This blatant conflict of
interest and constant legislative
castration of regulatory checks on
financial institutions - like the
repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act -
illustrate a legacy of decisions made
by a small group of very powerful
and very wealthy people.
Right before the controversial
Nobel decision, Americans were
treated to a similar spectacle. What
the Commission on Presidential
Debates calls the "presidential
debates," the League of Women
Voters (who ran the debates before
the commission) calls "the hood-
winking of the American public"
in a press release delivered in Oct.
1988 when they withdrew their
sponsorship and support for the
debates. The CDP calls itself a non-
partisan organization, but if you
look at the circumstances contrib-
uting to the commission's creation,
it's obvious that this corporation is
bipartisan and absolutely unwilling
to allow for the possibility of a third
party candidate.
This unfortunate event is not the
only reason for the red-blue monopo-
ly on politics, one of the cornerstones
of non-representative democracy.
The U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens
United decision makes the already
dim prospect of a political candidate
(who does not have millionaire back-
ers) participating in any election vir-
tually impossible.
Teasing out all the ways in which
corporate excess and influence have
damaged democracy in America is
as expansive and complicated a task

as solving the problems facing the
world today. So I ask why - given
the difficulty of the tasks at hand -
would the American public accept
only two plans for the future pros-
perity of our country? This should
be an unacceptable situation to every
American regardless of party affili-
ation. It is undemocratic that the
American public should not hear
nor can even recognize, the voices
of Rocky Anderson, Luis Rodriquez,
Dr. Jill Stein, Cheri Honkala, Gary
Johnson or Jim Gray (the respective
presidential and vice presidential
candidates for the Justice, Green and
Libertarian Parties).
More Americans should remem-
ber the fact that political offices
exist to serve the people and free-
dom in a representative democracy
should include freedom to choose
the best candidate to serve the 4
American public.
Duringthiselectionseason,Ienvi-
sion a possible future where candi-
dates are chosen based on individual
meritrather than the social standing,
wealth or inherited political power
they wield. I hope to have a future
where we are not presented with two
predetermined and extremely simi-
lar approaches to solving our nation's
problems. I hope we can create politi-
cal discourse where candidates will
not be able to simply ignore ,impor-
tant issues facing the public because
they did not fit into the palatable
scripted format of debates. I hope
others will see what's happening in
our country and stop focusing on
what is said in our red-blue political
discourse but rather what is not said.
Creating a political landscape
where government seeks out the
best candidates to fill important
offices is a simple idea that can be
embraced by voters from both sides
of the aisle. Gathering the political
will necessary to ensure that future
generations can vote in the meritoc-
racy Americans should have, rather
than the plutocracy our country is
becoming, is anything but simple.

Latest 'Paranormal'
installment falls

By Carly Keyes
For the Daily
As far as overall quality and
critical acclaim go, a sequel rarely
equals - and even more infre-

- the original: .

Spielberg and Lucas can occasion-

a psychic to foresee the inevitable
demise of the "Paranormal Activ-

In the fourth link of this chump

depicts a paranormally empow-

"Breaking
Bad"'s Skyler
White. The
"Skyler is a KAYLA
bitch" argu- UPADHYAYA
ment has
been so prev-
alent since the series' inception
that it feels tedious at this point.
But unfortunately, it's a conver-
sation we need to keep having.
Despite Anna Gunn's own com-
ments on the sexism behind the
vehement - sometimes even
violent - aversion to Skyler, and
despite the countless manifestos
scattered across the internet
that attempt to vindicate her,
the Skyler haters remain.
Just last week, I told a friend
of mine that Skyler was one of
my favorite characters on the
show.
"You like Skyler?" he asked.
Here we go again. When I
pressed him for an explanation
as to why he can't stand Skyler,
he gave the usual: "She's annoy-
ing."
Let's see. When Skyler first
finds out her husband has
ingrained himself in the danger-
ous world of the crystal meth
market - and has essentially
put their entire family at risk in
doing so - she reacts like any
rational human would. She's
furious. She wants Walt out of
her life. When he doesn't allow
that to happen, she cheats on
him - something folks seem
quicker to criticize than they do
Walt's multiple homicides.
Skyler isn't a bitch. She's
a prisoner. She's avictim of
Walt's self-absorbed, oppressive
behavior. She's a mother who
so desperately wants to protect
her children that she is willing
to put herself at risk, is willing
to compromise with the man
who threatens their safety in the
first place. Skyler's moral com-
pass is far from true north, but
every action she takes is for her
family's survival, while Walt's
actions are for the sake of his
own ego and relentless need for
control. Just look at how many
get-out-of-meth-free cards he
has turned down.
The only reason people hate
Skyler is the result of this per-
verse attachment to the show's
antihero. Skyler gets in the way
of Walt, our chemistry-teacher-
turned-meth-maker, who has
transformed into nothing short
of a sociopathic nightmare. It's a

'2 Days iOn New York'
'too scattered to shine

By NATALIE GADBOIS
DailyArts Writer
No one plays disheveled and
erratic as well as Julie Delpy
("Le Skylab"); her effortless
charm, beauty
and innumer-
able neuroses
combine into 2 Days in
something New York
enchanting.
Unfortunately, At the
the same cannot Michigan
be said about
Delpy's most Magnolia
recent project,
"2 Days in New York."
This eccentric sequel to the
2007 French gem "2 Days in
Paris" chronicles two days in the
life of Marion, played by Delpy
(who also wrote, directed and
starred in both movies). Her new
boyfriend, Mingus (Chris Rock,
"Death at a Funeral") is thrown
into culture shock after meet-
ing her oversexed and politically
incorrect French family. "New
York," however, lacks the quiet
originality of its predecessor,
and while the latest doesn't lack
charm, it's a rehash of the original
with some unsatisfactory tweaks.
Marion finds herself residing
in New York with Mingus, her
son Lulu from a previous rela-
tionship with Jack, her neurotic
"Paris" ex and Mingus's daughter
Willow (Talen Ruth Riley). They
live a storybook cozy urban life,
but their world is turned upside
down when Marion's narcissistic
sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) and
her overly frank father Jeannot
(Albert Delphy) visit from Paris,
joined by Rose's creepy boy-
friend Manu (Alexandre Nahon).
These three quickly leave a path
of destruction both through New
York and Marion's relationship
- Jeannot is detained for try-
ing to sneak 30 sausages through
customs, Manu walks into the
apartment and immediately tells
Mingus that he loves "the blacks"

STREAK
From Page 1A
During pregame warm-ups,
the Spartans half-surprised the
crowd by emerging with chrome
helmets. On the other half of
the field, it looked like business
as usual for Michigan. But this
week was a little different. It
always is. Their mindset was
printed out in maize on their
blue T-shirts.
"Finish," the shirt read.
"Through the whistle for my
team."
'Team 133' did just that. They
finally learned to finish the
Spartans. And that finishing
came from everyone, even the
least likely candidates.
Vincent Smith finished.
Nobody expected Robinson
to hand off with two minutes
remaining on the clock. But
Smith took the handoff, cut right
past two defenders and scam-
pered for a 12-yard gain.
Drew Dileo finished. Nobody

expected the kid who recently
said, "That's why they call me
The White Receiver" to make
three crucial catches and be
Michigan's leading receiver
against the Spartans.
Brendan Gibbons finished.
Nobody expected the stocky,
long-haired kicker to play hero,
much less kick three perfect
field goals. Two years ago he
went 1-for-5 kicking. He just
plain stunk.
Today, they each came away
victors.
While the entire Michigan
team - from head coach Brady
Hoke to the players - was care-
ful to not give Michigan State
any bulletin-board material this
week, they had the edge enter-
ing against a rather mediocre
Spartan squad, but they stuck to
the company line:
Michigan-Michigan State was
a big game, a rivalry game. No
rivalry game is bigger than the
rest.
But failure to beat the in-state
rivals had been weighing on

everyone's mind, and not just
this week.
"It's been a conversation for
the last four years," Dileo said.
Kovacs said the victory "got
the monkey off the back a little
bit."
"This program was in desper-
ate need of a win in this game,"
Kovacs said. "I'm glad that we
executed."
Oh, but it wasn't pretty. Nei-
ther offense could move, with
only small flashes of excitement
here and there. Michigan won
on four field goals. The last time
the Wolverines won a game
without a touchdown was Nov.
11, 1995, when Michigan beat
Purdue, 5-0, on a safety and a
field goal.
That's messy, gritty, boring
football. But it really didn't mat-
ter how it got done. Through
the whistle, until the clock read
zeroes, Michigan just had to
finish.

ENDOWMENT
From Page 1A
June 2011 and June 2012.
The University's Report of
Investments notes that some of
the spending "was partially off-
set by new endowment gifts and
transfers."
The endowment was valued at
its highest ever in fiscal year 2011.
The previous two fiscal years
where the endowment decreased
- 2002 and 2009 - have been
attributed to the years of the
dot-com industry boom and the
most recent economic recession,
respectively. This is the first time
the data, which was first recorded
starting in 1988, show the endow-
ment decreased in a non-recession
year.
Despite the endowment's
decrease, its long-term perfor-
mance in a more than ten-year
period has performed remarkably

well, growing 9.61 percent on an
annual basis. In a conclusion to
the report, Timothy Slottow, the
University's executive vice presi-
dent ahd chief financial officer,
and L. Erik Lundberg, the Uni-
versity's chief investment officer,
wrote that the long-term growth
places it. within the upper quar-
tile of highest performing college
endowments.
"Financial markets continue to
be challenging due to uncertain-
ties tied to the lingering effects of
the financial crisis and lower glob-
al growth prospects," Slottow and
Lundberg wrote. "Investments
could remain volatile and low in
coming years asa result."
White pointed out the growth
is particularly of interest because
it outperforms the ten-year return
of S&P 500 - an index of stock
market prices based on major
companies.
"The endowment's annualized
ten-year return ... is 9.6 percent,

and that is ahead of the custom
benchmark by 2.1 percentage
points and is well ahead of the
well-known S&P stock index,
which has gained 5.3 percent
annualized over the same 10 year
period," White said.
The report indicated the big-
gest strong point in the other-
wise mediocre performance of
the portfolio was a 14.77 percent
increase in fixed income payments
to the University. Fixed income is
mostly made up of bonds that are
required to issue periodic returns
to the borrower.
Slottow added that fixed
income's role is primarily as a
"deflation hedge," and has ben-
efited from falling interest rates
in global markets.
The University's investments
in venture capital, private equity
and real estate also enjoyed mod-
est gains. Investments in natural
resources - mostly oil and gas -
declined by 2.4 percent.

to participate in collective bar-
gaining.
The proposal is sponsored by
Citizens for Affordable Qual-
ity Home Care and the Service
Employee International Union,
the largest health care union in
the country.
In an October poll conducted
by Fox 2 News, about 47 percent
of Michigan voters support Pro-
posal 4, while about 37 percent
were opposed and 16 percent
were undecided.
Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der said in a September press
release that the proposal would
cause in-home health care
workers to be obligated to join
a union, regardless of their per-
sonal intent.
"Proposal 4 ... would amend
our constitution to force Michi-
gan's 60,000 home health care
aides to join a labor union," Sny-
der said in the release. "Those
workers would be forced to have
union dues withheld, whether
they want to or not."
Michael Head, a former state
official involved in the devel-
opment of the council under
former Democratic Gov. Jenni-
fer Granholm, said health care
workers would receive better
pay under the conditions of the
proposal.
"Before (the Quality Care
Council) was put into place,
(home help) workers were paid
essentially less than minimum
wage," Head said. "It is true they
have to pay dues or a service fee
(to the SEIU), but it's also true
that they get paid better."
State Rep. Mark Ouimet (R-
Scio Twp.) said workers should
not be bound to join unions under
stipulations of the state constitu-
tion, noting that Democrats and
Republicans alike have expressed
opposition to the proposal.
"I don't have any problems
with the unionization," Ouimet
said. "I just think it's important
that people can do it by choice
versus by coercion."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said the proposal would
return the benefits previously
enjoyed by home health workers.
"(The proposal) would essen-
tially put the situation with
home health care workers back
the way it was a couple years ago
before the Legislature passed a
law defining home health care
workers as not eligible to form a
union," Irwin said.
He said the creation of the

training programs and registry
would help families make the
best possible choice when choos-
ing a home health care provider,
adding that the proposal also pro-
vides a less expensive option to
those in need of intensive care.
"I think the public really ben-
efits because home health care
is vastly cheaper than nursing
home care and it makes a lot of
sense for us to encourage people
to utilize that service delivery
model," Irwin said.
LSA senior Nicole Miller, a
member of the University's chap-
ter of College Republicans, said
she doesn't believe unionization
should be included in the state
constitution.
"Most of these workers are
family members or good family
friends who are caring for rela-
tives and I don't see the reason
why the union would benefit
them," Miller said.
She added that she feels the
wording of the ballot proposal is

From Page 1A
think we accomplished that. What
we did do is take all of those rec-
ommendations very seriously and
they're reflected in the action that
was taken today."
FrankLoMonte-executivedirec-
tor ofthe Student Press Law Center, a
Virginia non-profit organization that
works to protect the rights of student
journalists - said not all services per-
formed by a lawyer are a matter of
attorney client privilege.
"It's really going to depend on
the purpose for which the report
was prepared," LoMonte said.
LoMonte explained that if an
entity believes it may be sued as
a result of the work of a law firm,
they may retain privilege.
"If there's reason to believe the
college is going to be involved in
a court case or criminal investi-
gation, then the report might be
privileged," LoMonte said. "If you
think you mightbe oncthe receiving
end of legal action, that's probably
privileged."
LoMonte said if a lawyer is
hired to investigate an incident and
gather facts, that doesn't neces-
sarily guarantee a privileged com-
munication. He added that if the
report is something that could have
been accomplished by a University
administrator, such work is likely
not under privilege.
The Office of University Audits
released an internal review of the
incident in February.
LoMonte pointed out that it's
also possible for privilege to be
fully or partially waived by a cli-
ent. He said the University could
release portions of the document
or waive the rights by discussing its
contents at a public meeting.

operations.

unsatisfactory.
"The language on the actual
proposal, it's not misleading, but
it doesn't say in very clear, explic-
it terms what the proposal would
do," Miller said.
LSA senior Lauren Coffman,
the communications director
for the University's chapter of
College Democrats, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the pro-
posal is vital to providing the
treatment necessary for disabled
residents.
"It is important that our most
vulnerable citizens receive
the care that they deserve and
require," Coffmanwrote.
She added that the measure is
beneficial to health care workers
as well as recipients.
"The measure also allows
for the unionization of the care
workers, ensuring that they are
ensured the resources necessary
to serve our citizens while also
maintaining a fair standard of liv-
ing," Coffman wrote.
The board reported that there
was a "categorically unacceptable"
failure to communicate the reports
of child pornography to the proper
authorities.
"There was a clear failure ... to
timely and effectively communi-
cate regarding the reported pos-
session of child pornography by.a
medical resident," thememo said.
The memo also said some Uni-
versity employees had undertaken
their own flawed investigation
instead of reporting the incident to
police.
"Certain University person-
nel (especially in the Health Sys-
tem and in the Office of General
Counsel) inappropriately investi-
gated the reported child pornog-
raphy information independently,
without involving or referring the
incident to an appropriate law
enforcement agency," the memo
said. "The individuals who made
that determination are no longer
employees of the University."
The lead UMHS attorney cited
in the University's audit allegedly
covered up the incident and left the
University in June 2011, one month
after the incidentallegedlyoccurred.
The regents concluded that the
relationships and communication
between University Hospital Secu-
rity and the Department of Public
Safety are "broken and demand
repair." The board made several
recommendations to fix the afore-
mentioned problems including the
formation of the new Division of
Public Safety and Security.
In the memo, the regents vowed
to continue implementing the rec-
ommendations of the Safety and
Security Steering Committee,
which was established as a result of
the internal responseto the Jenson
incident.
"The situation that gave rise
to thewse changes is terrible and
unacceptable," the memo stated. 4

in timely reportingto law enforce-
ment of this kind of serious mis-
conduct"

Saturday, students rallied in sup-
port of the Republican ticket
during a tailgate event featuring
U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the
House Majority Leader.
Cantor, whose daughter
attends the University, came
to Ann Arbor to campaign for
Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney and other Michigan
Republicans. As supporters sur-
rounded the congressman to take
pictures and shake his hand in
the parking lot outside of Crisler
Center, Cantor spoke to attendees
about the pivotal role Michigan
will play in the upcoming presi-
dential election.
In an interview during the
event, Cantor said it's impor-
tant for students to consider job
growth and creation when head-
ingto the polls.
"I think the people here and
the students in Ann Arbor under-
stand this is a huge election.
We've got a big choice to make
as to which direction we want to

go in as a country," Cantor said.
"How we can create more jobs
for students coming out of these
fantastic, world class educational
institutions like U of M?"
LSA senior Jared Boot, the
chair of the University's chapter
of College Republicans, empha-
sized the importance of inviting
respected names in the Republi-
can Party to Ann Arbor to garner
excitement and support for the
GOP presidential ticket.
"We probably aren't going to
win Ann Arbor, but we really
want to maximize Republican
turnout," Boot said. "And maybe
change some minds."
Matt Frendewey, the director
of communications for the Michi-
gan Republican Party and a Uni-
versity alum, distributed T-shirts
and other Romney/Ryan gear at
the event. He highlighted why he
believes Romney should appeal to
students on campus.
"More than half of all gradu-
ates right now don't have a job or
they're underemployed and car-
rying a massive amount of debt,"
Frendewey said. "So there are
serious issues that college stu-
dents are facing and coming to
termswith ... issuesthatGovernor
Romneyis talking about."
Boot added that he supported
what he described as Romney's
moderate positions on issues such
as Pell Grants, student loans and
domestic partnerships.
"I'm a moderate Republican,"
Boot said. "That resonates with

youngRepublicansbecauseyoung
Republicans aren't necessarily
as conservative as older Republi-
cans" in terms of social issues.
The Students for Romney tail-
gate also included supporters and
volunteers for the campaign to
elect Republican Dan Horning to
the University's Board of Regents.
Horning also hosted a tailgate
nearby. Boot discussed the close
relationship the College Repub-
licans have with Horning, who
perviouslyservedas aregentfrom
1995-2002. He also described his
plans to curb University spending
and fight union influence, as well
as increase the number of in-state
students at the University.
Boot discussed how important
it is to campaign for Republican
candidates since Romney is nar-
rowing his margins with Presi-
dent Barack Obama in the polls in
Michigan. He added that if both
Republican candidates for regent
are elected, the GOP will control
the board.
Ann Arbor volunteers phone
banked after the tailgate on
behalf of Romney. Boot noted
that despite Ann Arbor's liberal
reputation, he plans to lure out as
many Republicans as possible for
this election season.
"I feel like on campus it's very
homogenous with political ideol-
ogy and people might not feel like
they'd be accepted," Boot said. "A
lot of people on campus are closet
Republicans and we want to get
them out of the closet."

ing issues.
DPSS will encompass DPS,
Housing Security and Hospitals
& Health Centers Security, and
be led by an executive director
who reports directly to the Uni-
versity president. Current DPS
executive director Joe Piersante
will assume the positions of
DPSS executive director as well
as police chief until a national
search for a DPSS executive
director is completed.
The report, which was origi-
nally estimated to cost the Uni-
versity $105,000, showed that in
many instances, DPS, Hospital
Security and Housing Security
do not cooperate effectively.
Specifically, it reported a "sys-
temic lack of mutual respect and
appreciation" between Hospital
Security and DPS.
"The lack of a healthy work-
ing relationship between the
three organizations contributes
to confusion, misunderstand-
ing, miscommunication (and) a
lack of trust and respect," the
study said.
DPS, also known as Universi-
ty Police, is an accredited, armed
police force composed of sworn
officers who serve as the prima-
ry police on campus. Housing
Security and Hospital Security
are composed of trained but
non-armed, non-sworn officers
who protect residence halls and
hospital buildings, respectively.
The report compared the
University's security operations
to those at eight other universi-
ties, including Ohio State Uni-
versity and the University of
Chicago. In contrast to the Uni-
versity of Michigan's results,
when distinct units were pres-
ent at other schools, they were
observed to be more efficient
and cooperative.
However, many used their
official university police force

to fill the distinct roles of the
University's divided DPS,
Housing Security and Hospital
Security.
The report noted there is no
formal organizational connec-
tion between the branches, and
the director of each reports to
a different division within the
University, claiming this nega-
tively affects their respective
duties and creates a disconnect
among the three groups.
The study said each individ-
ual unit was "well-run, profes-
sional and efficient," but as a
whole the three do not coordi-
nate effectively.
It also stated that while
individually the units tried to
ensure safety, there was an
"absence of a shared overall
vision for public safety," noting
that unit goals differ greatly.
The report also noted that
students and staff may not
understand the differences
between the three units, con-
sidering officers from all three
departments refer to them-
selves as public safety officers.
Specifically, members of
the campus community are
reported to have in many cases
believed they were speaking
with sworn University police
officers and filing official police
reports, but they were actually
dealing with non-sworn Hous-
ing or Hospital Security offi-
cers.
Confusion about the role
of Hospital Security officers
was cited in the University's
internal audit of the delay in
reporting Jenson's possession
of child pornography, where
several staff members said they
believed they were being inter-
viewed by University Police
when in fact the investigators
were Hospital Security officers.
The report also noted that
only one in three resident advi-
sors interviewed knew the
difference between Housing
Security and DPS. One in ten of
those interviewed did not know
the University has its own police
force. Many of them believed
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment responds to incidents in
the residence halls.
The report said Housing
Security worked better with
DPS than Hospital Security
regularly does. It acknowledged
that Housing Security did not
hesitate to request assistance
from DPS when needed and
that when DPS arrived, Housing
Security let officers take con-
trol while continuing to provide
assistance.
The assessment said many of
those interviewed in the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs - which
oversees University Housing -
viewed DPS as more of an on-
call service than a partner in
ensuring the safety of the resi-
dence halls. Staff members also
expressed concern at the pres-
ence of armed police officers
within halls.
"We don't need or want
police in the buildings... no guns
patrolling the hallways," one
staff member said.
There were clear and per-
sistent problems with the rela-
tionship between Hospital
Security and DPS, which the
report alleged stemmed from
the differing approaches of each:
organization. The report noted

that Hospital Security focuses
on safety and customer satisfac-
tion, while DPS is primarily con-
cerned with law enforcement.
UMHS staff had a positive
view of Hospital Security and
its professionalism, the study
said. Many hospital employees
interviewed for the study said
they viewed Hospital Security
as an important member of the
UMHS team and viewed DPS as
"pushy and intimidating."
The report noted that many
DPS staff members do not view
Hospital Security as a help-
ful ally in law enforcement.
Hospital Security officers also
expressed concern with their
police counterparts, noting that
many DPS officers appeared
condescending and heavy-
handed.
"We are always under attack
by DPS and we do not know
why. They do not look at us as
a valuable resource/partner,"
Hospital Security officers told
the investigators.
Many hospital employees said
DPS did not respect UMHS pro-
tocols. The report said on mul-
LIKE TH

tiple occasions that when DP
officers became impatient they
threatened UMHS staff with
obstruction of justice charges. {
Concerns regarding DP
officers carrying firearms in
hospital buildings were also
a common issue noted in the
report. The Hospital Security
department prefers to operat
within a weapons-free zone,
which has caused some security
officers to question DPS person-
nel about retaining their fire-
arm while in the building.
However, many DPS officer
said they felt they were unfairly
targeted, alleging that armed
Michigan State Police troopers
and Ann Arbor Police officers
were not asked to remove their
weapons, while DPS officers
*ere.
The report's authors applaud
ed DPS for their sophisticated
training and professionalism;
but expressed concern that DPS
focuses too much on "old-style"
policing, which may be the root
of the problems arising in Hos4
pital and Housing Security. 1
"The Department of Public
Safety is focused more on law
enforcement, criminal interdic-
tion and arrests than on a broad-
er role as steward of the safety
and security ofthe campus," the
report stated.
The report further noted:
"DPS police officers appear
to be directing their attention
towards validation from the
greater law enforcement com-
munity and away from their
focus on serving a university
community as a community
oriented campus public safety
organization."
On Friday, a report by the
University's Safety and Securit'
Steering Committee was alsd
released explaining the prog-
ress of the University's manage-
nient response to an internal
audit of the child pornography
incident.
Many of the responses to the
internal audit also answer con-
cerns expressed in the Margolis
ealy assessment, which was
largely conducted in April.
The committee said it had
addressed the recommenda
tions made in the internal audit,
adding that it informed many
University employees about
their responsibility to report
suspected crimes.
Since early April, assigned
DPS liaison officers have been
required to contact the Hospital
Security shift supervisors daily
during the day and afternoon
shifts, according to the com-
mittee report. The committee
said it also implemented cross-
unit training and team-building
exercises between units.
The committee also noted
&hat the University's 911 system
Has changed. Previously, 911
calls made in University hospital
buildings would go to a hospital
emergency operator who would
then dispatch Hospital Security
officers if needed. Those officers
would then decide if contacting
DPS was necessary.
Under the new system, DP
is able to monitor all 911 calls ta
the Hospital emergency center
and can be patched in as neces-
sary.

,The committee also autho4
rized the creation of shared
databases between the three
units. This allows each unit
to access security reports and
dispatch information from one
another more easily. While the
system is currently not updated
ittreal time, the committee said
that feature will be implement-
ed by next month.
The regents released a state-
ment Friday condemning the
lack of communication between
the security organizations
and vowing to fix the problemj
mainly through the creation of
the DPSS.
"The relationships and
communication between the
University's Health Systen
Security and the Department
of Public Safety are broken and
demand repair," the statement
said. "There must be a Univer-
sity-wide system that guar-
antees timely and effective
mmunication of potential
rious misconduct, as well as
e safety and security of all
our University constituen
nies."

The legend ofBear Gibbons, from zero to hero'

rendan Gibbons is an
anomaly.
Five minutes before
he would play hero, booting a
38-yard field goal in the wan-
ing seconds of the game to push
Michigan past Michigan State, the
redshirt junior placekicker paced
the length of
the Michigan
bench.
Behind

5-foot-7 frame made it too hard to
see through the maze of players on
the sideline, had hopped up on the
bench, giving him the perfect van-
tage point to watch quarterback
Denard Robinson finally break'
loose for a 44-yard run deep into
Spartan territory.
But Gibbons wasn't celebrating
like Norfleet. He was preparing,
his helmet already on. Somehow,
he knew this would come down
to his left leg. The prolific Michi-
gan offense had stuttered and
stumbled in Michigan State terri-
tory all afternoon, leaving the job
up to Gibbons and backup kicker
Matt Wile.
This time was no different,
except they weren't even within
Wile's range. He instead had to
punt and pray that the defense
could hold. It did. Michigan got
the ball back for one last push
with two minutes remaining.
Gibbons was perfect from 24
and 21 yards, Wile from 48. But as
the clock wound down, Robinson
found junior wide receiver Drew
Dileo for a 20-yard gain down to
the Michigan State 21-yard line.
Robinson, with a menacing
gleam in his eye, spiked the ball
with nine ticks left on the game
clock and started to trot toward
the sideline. He knew he didn't
need to finish this himself

Redshirt junior kicker Brendan Gibbons waves during pregame warm-ups before Michigan's 12-10 victory over Michigan State on Saturday.

Why?
Michigan had seen this scene
twice before. The first time was
in the 11th hour of the Sugar Bowl
on Jan. 4, when Gibbons planted
- from just one yard closer - and
connected on the game-winning
field goal in overtime to topple
Virginia Tech.
The second time was on Thurs-
day. Running a situational offense
in practice, the coaching staff gave
the scenario that the Wolverines
trailed by two. They just needed to
get within Gibbons' range. They
did. He nailed it.
This had become routine.
It wasn't so long ago that Gib-
bons was a cursed name around
Ann Arbor. Or, more accurately,
a cursed name with a defective
left let.

As a redshirt freshman in 2010,
Gibbons was named Michigan's
starting kicker. After just one suc-
cessful field goal in four attempts
- and a missed extra point - he
was yanked. His backup, Seth
Broekhuizen, had no better luck. .
So, then-head coach Rich
Rodriguez just avoided the kick-
ing game. He even held midseason
tryouts looking for a potential
walk-on kicker. Michigan finished
the season dead last in the nation,
making just four field goals in 15
tries. Redshirt junior left tackle
Taylor Lewan tells the story of a
trip to Olive Garden shortly after
that 7-6 season came to a close
with a 52-14 loss to Mississippi
State in the Gator Bowl. (Rodri-
guez finally came back to Gibbons
in that game. He tried a field goal.
And missed.)
Lewan and Gibbons, room-
mates at the time, took a seat and

Lewan decided to test the server.
She probably knew Lewan was a
football player, but the kid across
from him looked like any other
college boy.
"So, what did you think of the
kicker this year?" Lewan asked
her.
"I mean, just make a kick," the
server answered. "What're you
doing?"
Lewan gestured across the
table and grinned.
"This is 34, our kicker," he said.
Lewan likes to look back on that
day and laugh. Oh, how things
have changed.
Gibbons has neverlet the
criticism get to him too much.
The West Palm Beach, Fla. native
is something of a free spirit. How
free? Well, he even gave himself a
nickname once, Lewan said.
The two were in the basement
playing video games one after-
noon when Gibbons glanced over.
"Call me Bear," he said.
Bear? Right, because of the
mangylook, the hair, the beard.
Nope.
"I love them, they're so cuddly,"
Gibbons said.
"Get over yourself," Lewan
said, laughing. "You can'tgive
yourself a nickname."
It stuck, sort of. It didn't really

spread throughoutthe locker
room, but Gibbons loved it. On his
Twitter account, he goes by "Bear
Gibbons" and his background
photo is of a bear cub. The cub's
got the left foot in front of the
right, maybe measuring up a chip-
shot field goal.
And when Michigan coach
Brady Hoke arrived, he gave Gib-
bons a gimmicky mindset that
matched the kicker's goofy per-
sonality. Think brunettes, Bren-
dan. After sealing the Sugar Bowl
with his game-winning kick, Gib-
bons was asked during the post-
game press conference what was
going through his mind as he lined
up the kick. Gibbons hesitated,
looked down the table to his right,
where Hoke sat and then leaned
forward toward the microphone.
"Uh, brunette girls," he said.
Only when the room burst into
laughter did he finally crack a
grin.
"Every time we were struggling
in kicking, (Hoke) always tells me
to think about girls on the beach
or brunette girls. So that's what
we did. Made the kick."
Staring a one-point deficit in
the eye, Gibbons lined up his kick

at the left hash as steady as can be.
Michigan State called a timeout to
ice him, but Gibbons wasn't fazed.
"It really doesn't affect me at
all," he said. "I think it is kind of
pointless."
Everyone else, though, was in
panic mode.
Robinson didn't watch as Gib-
bons lined up the kick again.
"Ijust took a knee and prayed,"
Robinson said. "I was just thank-
ing the man above for givingus
the opportunity to step on the
field today."
Craig Roh and Lewan had their
hands in the turf, blocking for
Gibbons.
"Nothing gets by you, Taylor,"
Roh shouted.
Lewan, anchoring the strong-
side edge, fired back: "I block,
that's what I do, so I'm going to
block for this field goal."(That's
the way he remembered the con-
versation after the game, anyway.)
Dileo took the snap, placed it
down and Gibbons tucked it just
inside the right upright, sending
the stadium into a frenzy. 'Team
133' spilled onto the field, mobbing
Gibbons and falling into a dog pile
with five seconds left on the clock.
"I told everyone on the sideline,
'Don't rush the field."' Roundtree
said. "And then I was the main one
on the field."
A far cry from the days when
Michigan avoided its kicker, Gib-
bons had saved his team once
again, givingthe program its
900th win and breaking a four-
year skid againstthe Spartans.
It was the first time the Wol-
verines had won a game without
scoring a touchdown since Nov.11,
1995, when Michigan beat Purdue,
5-0, with a field goal and a safety.
And this time it was from Gib-
bons, a long-haired, stocky kicker
who once seemed Michigan's
unlikeliest hero.
After the final whistle, the mid-
field handshakes and "The Vic-
tors," Gibbons had four cameras
circling him he jogged across the
field and up the tunnel.
Lewan pegged Gibbons's jour-
ney just right.
"It's a complete zero-to-hero
turnaround." Lewan said.
Bear Gibbons, Michigan's
long-haired, stocky kicker, is an
anomaly. But he's rightwhere he
belongs.

"It's not easy to go on the road,
come home at two in the morning,
do all the stuff with recruits on
Saturday, and then turn around
and play a game Sunday," she said.
"It's easy to get distracted, espe-
cially with a young team, but they
were spot on."
Michigan was quick to find,
and keep possession, of the ball
for the majority of the first half,
outshooting Miami by a huge 16-2
margin. The team, though, strug-
gled to capitalize against Miami
goalkeeper Sarah Mueller.
"Their goalie had a really
good game," said junior forward
Rachael Mack. "She's solid, and
she came up really big for them, so
it wasn't necessarily the first shot
we got the goal off, and we had to
try for the rebound."
Miami's defense could only
hold off the Wolverines for so
long. Capitalizing on a corner in
the 26th minute, Mack got the

ball to redshirt sophomore Les-
lie Smith, who snuck it behind
Meuller to give Michigan the lead.
The RedHawks were unable
to answer before halftime, and
Michigan went into the locker
room feeling confident but not
content.
"We had to make some adjust-
ments tactically," Pankratz said.
"We were struggling breaking the
ball out of the fence, and with the
adjustments we were able to get
going after half."
The Wolverines came out look-
ing stronger than ever at the start
of the second half, and it was obvi-
ous that though the team is young
- there are 11 freshmen on the
roster - both the veteran play-
ers and newest members share
a sense of composure and trust
each other to get the job done.
Michigan did exactly what it
had talked about in the locker
room, adding to itslead in the first
10 minutes of the second half.
Mack, who has been the top

scorer this season,blasted the ball
through Mueller's legs, extending
the lead to 2-0 in the 44th minute.
She struck again in the 60th min-
ute, rebounding off a corner slot-
ting the ball right over Mueller's
head. The lead became more pre-
carious for the Wolverines in the
last 10 minutes of play, as Miami
pulled five corners in a row, giving
the RedHawks ample opportuni-
ties in front of the goal. But they
were unable to find the back of the
net and compete with the aggres-
siveness of the Michigan defense.
Throughout the game, Michi-
gan was able to move up the field
in a series of well-played short
passes and fakes. The polished
style of play was a significant fac-
tor in securing the win.
The Wolverines lone senior,
Liesl Morris, was very pleased
with the way that the team was
able to come together and pro-
duce a successful home record
this season - Michigan finished
9-1 in Ann Arbor for the year.

For the Daily
Four consecutive national
championships between 2007
and 2010. A 109-match win
streak spanning those four sea-
sons. Fourteen Big Ten titles in
21 seasons in the league. Five
straight sweeps against the Wol-
verines.
This is PENN STATE 3
Penn State MICHIGAN 2
volleyball.
In short, the top-ranked Nit-
tany Lions were set to wipe
the floor with the Wolverines
on Saturday night in front of a
full house at Cliff Keen Arena.
But two hours later, the arena
was still locked into a nail-biter
between the two Big Ten heavy-
weights. Penn State ultimately
finished with a five-set victory.
"We could have come out say-
ing they're the number one team
and just rolled over, but I think
we put up a really good fight,"
said junior outside hitter Lexi
Erwin. "It was truly a battle from
game one."
The score was point for point
thanks to scattered play on both
sides until Penn State appeared
to settle in, taking an 11-10 lead
after a long rally. In the first
game alone, there were three
lead changes and the score was
tied seven times. Eight kills from
Penn State's All-Big Ten junior
Ariel Scott and its .306 kill per-
centage in the first set meant a
25-19 loss for the Wolverines.
Michigan went on to drop the
second set in similar fashion by a
score of18-25. But it was a scrap-
py Wolverine defense that kept
both sets tight.
"(Penn State) just hits the ball
a little bit faster than most teams
we've played," said Michigan
coach Mark Rosen. "It's the rea-
son they're ranked number one.
Our team did a really good job of
raising their defensive level."

coach Mark Dantonio. "He's
a gamer. We knew that com-
ing into the football game....
They've got some other great
players, but I think that guy's a
gamer. He made a tough catch,
and it's not the only tough catch
he made. He's a holder as well,
so he gives them that guy as
well."
Redshirt junior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint broke off
the next play for a 38-yard scam-
per down into Michigan State's
red zone, which set up Brendan
Gibbons's first field goal of the
game to give Michigan a 3-0
DEFENSE
From Page 1B
"I don't really see a whole lot
of (the defense) because I'm on
offense obviously, but I have
trust in our coaches, and I think
that's kind of where it starts,
and I have trust in our players,"
Dileo said. "They got it done."
The leader of the defense,

fifth-year senior safety Jordan
Kovacs, said that Michigan
coach Brady Hoke and defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison want
and expect improvement every
week. That momentous stop
was evidence that the defense is
doing just that.
When the Wolverines last
lost a game, which happened
four weeks ago at Notre Dame,
they faced the exact same situ-
ation. The Fighting Irish were
trying to grind out the clock to
preserve their lead and clinch a
victory, and Michigan needed to
prevent that.
It didn't then. Notre Dame
got a first down, and the Wol-
verines lost.
Given another shot, the
Kovacs-led defense made good
on the chance.
"That's what I was think-
ing as we took the field, it's our
opportunity to redeem our-
selves and get our offense' the
ball back," Kovacs said. "Same
situation as Notre Dame, and
today we executed. We stopped
them when we needed to, made
some big plays and got the
offense the ball back and let

man libero Tiffany Morales and
Lexi Erwin - each picked up
14 digs. All told, the Michigan
defense held Scott to 17 kills and
set up many of its 64 kills in the
match.
"I can't do what I do unless
other people are helping me
along. I had the team behind me
the whole time.," said junior out-
side hitter Molly Toon.
With 10 digs, two blocks and
12 kills of her own, Toon was
one of four Wolverines who had
kills in the double digits on the
night. Junior middle blocker
Jennifer Cross contributed with
13 kills and six blocks. But it was
the team-leading 22-kill perfor-
mance from Erwin that had the
crowd on its feet through the
final three sets.
"The coaches got on me to
start being aggressive and that
started working," Erwin said.
"I definitely felt supported the
whole game, so that was great."
That aggression came at the
right time for the Wolverines,
who stole the third set from
lead.
Once Dileo got the momen-
tum going, he didn't relent.
Later in the second quarter,
Robinson found Dileo in stride
on a short crossing pattern, and
Dileo took the ball down into
Spartan territory before being
dragged down from behind.
The play set up Matt Wile's first
collegiate field goal, which was
good from 48 yards out.
Since he was the one who got
the ball rolling, it only made
sense that Dileo would be the
one to close it out.
On the final drive of the game,
with 18 seconds on the clock
and no timeouts left, Robinson
found Dileo 20 yards downfield
on the left hashmark, bringing

the Nittany Lions, 25-21. With
the energy of the crowd behind
them, Erwin and her teammates
tied up the match in the fourth
set (25-22). Erwin pounded 15 of
her 22 kills against Penn State's
rattled defense in the second two
sets.
"I loved the way we fought,"
Rosen said.
Michigan found itself in an
early hole in the final set and
could not make up enough
ground to outscore the Nittany
Lions in 15 short points.
"We had a lot of fun when we
were playing," said Toon. "It's
always great 'to play the best
team in the country and I think
we put on a good show."
Despite the loss, the Wolver-
ines were all smiles after the
game.
It's alwaystoughto lose, Rosen
said, but against a team like Penn

sonal victory of confidence if
nothing else.

"Basically, the offensive line
gave me a lot of time," Robin-

missed Drew, and then he ended
up being open on the second one,
and that's when I got the ball to
him. Thankfully the offensive
line and the running backs did
a great job of blocking and gave
me time to throw the ball."
From there, Robinson spiked
the ball with nine seconds left,
and Gibbons punched through
the game-winning field goal.
"I have a role on this team,
and to fill my role like I did today
is nice for me," Dileo said. "It's

'M' hockey blows past Bentley

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team
fired off 56 shots and enjoyed a
late flurry of goals to finish off
a 6-3 come-from-behind victory
over Bentley.
"Even though we got down in
the game, I thought we played
with a lot of patience, discipline
and just a good overall team
work ethic," said Michigan
coach Red
Berenson. BENTLEY 3
After MICHIGAN 6
the two
teams spent the first period's
early moments feeling each
other out, Michigan (2-1) finally
produced a promising 2-on-1
with freshman forward Boo
Nieves and sophomore forward
Alex Guptill streaking down
the slot. The Falcon defender
made the first move, commit-
ting to Nieves, leaving Guptill
open, but the puck never got to
him as the clearing attempt suc-
ceeded.
At the 8:07 mark of the first
period, Bentley (1-1) had a 2-on-
1 of its own, but it came away
with more to show. Michigan
freshman goalie Steven Racine
allowed a lazy snapshot from
the top of the slot to skip past
him and the Falcons had the
early lead.
The Wolverines had their
best chance to score in the
opening frame when Nieves
fed senior forward Lindsay
Sparks a perfect pass right into
the crease. Sparks hesitated
and only mustered a weak shot
attempt. Though Bentley net-
minder Branden Komm didn't
need to flash the leather on
Sparks's shot, he gloved several
tough shots in the first period,
and Michigan found itself trail-
ing 1-0 after one period.
"Give (Bentley) credit - they
were putting a lot of pressure
on our defense and trying to get
us to turn the puck over, and we

Senior forward and team captain A.J. Treais scored twice in the Wolverines' 6-3 victory over Bentley on Friday.

did a few times," Berenson said.
It didn't take long for the
Wolverines to open the second
period's scoring. Just 30 sec-
onds in, a messy scrum in front
of the Bentley goal ended in a
tap in from senior captain A.J.
Treais that tied the game.
But Bentley's response came
almost as quickly. A Falcon shot
deflected off of Racine's pads
and forward Jared Rickord was
there to give his team the lead
once again.
Still, Treais bailed out the,
Wolverines once again on- a
beautiful give-and-go with
sophomore forward Phil Di
Giuseppe. The tally knotted the
game at two.
Minutes later, Michigan
looked like it should've taken
the lead as Komm corralled a
backhand from Guptill, and
the referee blew his whistle,
ending the play. But right after
the whistle sounded, the puck
trickled out of Komm's grasp
and over the goal line. After a

review, the officials upheld the
initial ruling.
Luckily for the Wolverines,
the go-ahead goal came not
long afterward. Freshman for-
ward Andrew Copp, who com-
mitted to the Wolverines in
May, scored his first collegiate
goal playing in his first colle-
giate game.
He reacted quickly for a
one-timer look and Michigan
regained the lead, 3-2, going
into the second intermission.
In the third period, Guptill
extended the Michigan lead to
4-2 off a wrister that directly
followed a faceoff in Bentley's
end.
The goal was the first of the
season for Guptill, who tied for
the team lead last season with
16 goals. Sophomore forward
Zach Hyman followed with his
first marker of the young season
off a rebound goal that found its
way through the Bentley goal-
tender's five hole.
"It's pretty satisfying,"

Hyman said of his first goal
since Nov. 12 of last year. "I was
a scratch last week, and it put a
little bit of a fire under mybutt."
Bentley managed to slip
one more past Racine during
a delayed penalty at the 10:17
mark of the third period, but
the Michigan offense kept up
the pressure, thwarting any
possible comeback attempt by
the Falcons.
Guptill added the night's
final marker and his second
of the night after senior for-
ward Kevin Lynch had his shot
deflected from in tight, before
the New Market, Ont. native
hammered it home to seal the
victory for the Wolverines.
Michigan now will have a
full week off before taking the
ice at Yost against Miami (Ohio)
to begin CCHA play.
"One thing we don't have to
worry about is a game tomor-
row night," Berenson said. "I
think our team left everything
on the ice tonight."

victory.
Though he is 2-0 on the year,
Racine's performance hasn't been
the kind that the Wolverines were
accustomed to in years past with
Shawn Hunwick in net. Racine
is still in a battle for the starting
netminder position with fellow
freshman Jared Rutledge. Rut-
ledge doesn't have a victory yet,
but Michigan coach Red Beren-
son expressed early in the season
that neither goalie has seized the
job.
Opposing Michigan in net for
the Falcons was junior Branden
Komm. Coincidentally, Komm
and Racine both are from Wil-
liamsville, N.Y. - a small suburb
of Buffalo.
While Racine started on Fri-
day, Berenson said Rutledge has
been "lights out" in practice this
past week and that he is begin-
ning to find his comfort zone in
the net.
After a slow first two minutes
of the game in which neither side
tallied a single shot, the Wolver-
ine offense finished the first peri-
od with 12 shots, compared to just
six for the Falcons. Though the
final score was 6-3, Friday night's
game turned into a battle in the
net, especially on Bentley's side
of the ice. Racine finished with a
.880 save percentage and Komm
an .890 save percentage.
Racine's stat-line benefited
from a strong defensive effort
that was absent from the Falcons'
end. He struggled throughout the
game to control the shots and stop
the puck from rebounding in front
of the net, and looked flustered at

times when there was pressure on
him in the crease.
And the final score didn't
show the kind of performance
that Komm put forth. Michigan
totaled 54 shots, 20 of them com-
ing in the second period. With the
constant battering of the Falcon
net, it was just a matter of time
before the goals started coming
for the Wolverines. It finally hap-
pened in the third period when
Michigan tallied another 22 shots
on net.
"(Komm) is a good goalie," said
senior forward A.J. Treais. "I've
played against him my whole life.
It's just a matter of keeping at it
and getting shots on net and get-
ting guys in the paint and eventu-
ally the pucks started going in."
Both players are 21 years
old, but Racine's inexperience
showed early and often. He let a
soft stick-side goal go right past
him on Bentley's first goal of the
game, which gave the Falcons a
1-0 lead. Berenson said that he
didn't like the first goal, but was
pleased overall with Racine's per-
formance.
"Even in the third period when
we were up three goals, there
were some point-blank shots from
the slot that he was in good posi-
tion," Berenson said.
On more than one occasion he
probably should have held the
puck to allow his lines to change,
but instead passed it behind the
net to a defenseman, leaving the
same line on the ice. But with
CCHA play opening this week
when the Wolverines host Miami
(Ohio) in Ann Arbor, Berenson is
still not set on a starter.
"I can't tell you that there's a
plan right now," Berenson said. "I
want to see them both play well
... They both need to play games
and they'll both play, and we'll see
where we go from there."

Michigan beats

was enough for Michigan to grab
its second win all-time against
Indiana, winning by a final score
of 2-1.
The Wolverines (2-2-1 Big Ten,
5-7-1 overall) arrived in Bloom-

assistant coach Tommy McMen-

the gameplan.
"We need to trust in the game
plan and stick to it," McMen-
emy said.."Just execute like we're
capable of doing and try to focus
more on possession. If we can do
that, we'll finish a lot more close
matches."
But solid play in the second
half has not been the team's forte
this fall. In the opening half this
season, Michigan has outscored
opponents 11-6, but it has been

surprise receiving leader on
Saturday, and he set career highs
in receptions and receiving yards.
In the second half, he caught two
difficultcthird-down passes to
seet up Michigan's first field goal,
then caught a 35-yard pass which
led to the Wolverines' second
field goal. And, of course, in the
fourth quarter, Dileo grabbed a
20-yard reception with 1B seconds
left to put Michigan in range for
the game-winning field goal
When Michigan needed big plays,
Dilen. was there time and again.

SOPHOMORE CORNERBACK
RAYMON TAYLOR: Taylor was
Michigan's third-leading tackler on
Saturday with seven total tackles. He
also played well defending the pass.
But Taylor gets the nod here because
of the gruesome-looking injury he
sustained in the fourth quarter. While
tackling Michigan State receiver
Bennie Fowler, Taylor braced himself
with his left arm, which appeared
to Isyperextend. After the game,
Michigan coach Brady Hoke called
the injury a "boo boo" and said
Taylor should be fine. Which means
Hoke and Taylor are much tougher
than us, or someone's fibbing.
