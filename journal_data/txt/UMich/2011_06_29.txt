new plan
Proposal aims to add
additional service to
Ypsilanti as well as

By YOUNJOO SANG
Daily News Reporter
The Ann Arbor Transporta-
tion Authority recently proposed
a 30-year Transit Master Plan
that would improve transporta-
tion between the Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti areas, potentially easing
the burden of transportation for
students lacking other forms of
travel.
The plan, described by
AATA as a "30-year strategy that
addresses various public transit
needs in the county," strives to
implement suggestions and feed-
back from the community as well
as transit service providers as part
of a collaborative effort.
Mary Stasiak, manager of
community relations for AATA,
said the transit plan focuses on
four different services to better
serve the Ann Arbor and neigh-
boring areas.
"We are trying to improve
connections, improve frequency,
late-night service, weekend ser-
vice between Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti, primarily in Washtenaw, but
not limited to that," she said.
In order to make the proposal
work, Stasiak said that AATA has

Ann Arbor City
Council passes
zoning and licensing
legislation.
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
ManagingNews Editor
After being postponed sev-
eral times over the course of the
past seven months, Ann Arbor
City Council passed two medical
marijuana ordinances on June

20 that establishes zoning and
cultivation regulations in the
city.
The ordinances, which
passed in an 8-2 vote, sets spe-
cific zoning guidelines for medi-
cal marijuana dispensaries and
cultivation facilities in the city
and calls for a maximum of 20
licenses to be given to dispensa-
ries during the first year, with a
licensing board determining the
allowance of additional appli-
cants.
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) -
one of the primary forces behind

the legislation - said she is con-
tent with the ordinances, largely
because city governments often
follow the lead of other political
entities, rather than formulating
more non-traditional policy.
"It was difficult because
there isn't a model for medical
marijuana - not for licensing
and not for zoning ... we didn't
know what would work, in other
words," she said.
Briere added she didn't see
a need for changes in zoning
or licensing policies until Ann

'U' to offer master's in Health Informatics

Schools of
Information and
Public Health
launch new degree
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Amid rising healthcare costs
and an industry constantly
afflicted by turmoil, the Univer-
sity is maintaining its position as
a frontrunner in the health field
with the official creation of a new
master's program in Health Infor-
matics, following over three years
of planning.
Meghan Genovese, Health
Informatics program manager,
said the University will join a
small group of schools around
the nation that offer this type of
degree program, which will be
run by both the School of Infor-
mation and the School of Public
Health.
Additionally a graduate cer-
tificate program will be available
for the Winter 2012 term and the
52-credit Master's Program for

the Winter 2013 term, she said.
Charles Friedman is stepping
down from his position as chief
scientific officer of the Office
of the National Coordinator for
Health Information Technology
to head the new program.
Friedman first came to the
University four years ago to speak
about the benefits of developing a
Health Informatics program, and
has worked throughout most of
his professional career to promote
health IT nationally, according to
the ONC website. In the academic
world, Friedman has taught and
held numerous titles at both the
University of Pittsburgh and the
University of North Carolina
In the health informatics
field, Friedman said "the breadth
of potential careers is really quite
impressive" and that the Health
Information Technologies Indus-
try is "rapidly expanding."
Jeffrey MacKie-Mason, dean
of the School of Information, said
in addition to being one of the few
in the country, the new program is
"really quite novel."
"Most (Health Informatics
programs) are focused on clinical
health records," MacKie-Mason

said."We're focusing first and
foremost on consumer health, on
individuals taking care of them-
selves and dealing with their
health conditions outside of the
hospital ... and public health."
Martin Philbert, dean of the
School of Public Health, called
the program "a fabulous, exciting,
and unique partnership between
the School of Information and the
School of Public Health."
"I am delighted that Chuck
Friedman will be joining our
health management college facul-
ty," Philbert said. "He's extraordi-
narily well thought of ... he brings
us immediate national and inter-
national credibility and visibility."
Philbert said that upon com-
pleting the program - which
also includes an internship fea-
ture - graduates will likely find
success in attaining jobs, citing
a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
study that predicted an 18-per-
cent growth for employment in
the field of Health Informatics.
Specifically, Friedman listed
public health agencies in local,
state and national government
and consulting firms within the
expanding health informatics

field as potential job sites for grad-
uates of the program.
In addition to the program,
graduates will also be the bene-
factors of the reputations of the
School of Information and the
School of Public Health according
to MacKie-Mason, who identified
both schools as falling within the
top three of their respective fields
nationally.
Genovese said that with the
degree, students could potentially
become involved with projects
like personal health management,
where they would develop pro-
grams that track the progress of a
patient's diet and exercise online.
Friedman echoed Genovese's
sentiments, saying that students
will be able to embark on projects
that will help them develop skills
and "build technological tools"
that will help them become prac-
titioners or assist at agencies in
the health care field.
As of yet, there are no spe-
cific numbers in regards to the
expected number of students in
the program, though Friedman
said he does not expect the grow-
ing industry to disappear anytime
soon.

Ann Arbor City Council
recently approved the proposal
for construction of a new 13-story,
173-unit high-rise apartment on
East Washington Street called The
Varsity - a project expected to
compete with local apartments like
Sterling 411 Lofts and Tower Plaza
Condominium.
Donnie Gross, president of
Potomac Holdings - the company
in charge of buildingthe new com-
plex - said their goal is to break
ground in early 2012 and have the
apartmentsavailable to studentsby
fall 2013 in an effort to help house a
growing demographic of students.
Gross said he feels University

housing market in Ann Arbor was
underserved," Gross said. "But the
maintwo reasons for bringing (The
Varsity) to Ann Arbor is the loca-
tion and the socioeconomic make-
up of students."
The Varsity will include fea-
tures like amenity spaces, fitness
centers and business offices, and
each apartment will also have its
own washer and dryer, Gross said.
He added that housing options
will include one-bedroom, two-
bedroom and four-bedroom spaces
with a corresponding number of
bathrooms to ensure that each stu-
dent will have a private bathroom
of their own.
"Our plan is to bring (a type of
apartment) that is not currently in
Ann Arbor," he said.
Mark Foraker, senior vice pres-

leasing for this year was slower
than the last, he still anticipates
filling all his rooms for the upcom-
ing semester.
"The Varsity's additional
apartments will likely put further
downward pressure on rents in the
market as a whole and particularly
those now targeted at the highest
rents," Foraker wrote. "The well
run, professionally managed proj-
ects will probably be fine, but it will
be very competitive in the next few
years."
Brian Tomsic, associate broker
for University Realty Associates in
Tower Plaza Condominium, said
he had not heard of the recentplans
for The Varsity but is concerned
about how the Ann Arbor housing
market will be impacted.
He said he feels confident

rooms Tower Plaza offers.
He added that while the new
development may pose as a threat
to him and the other real estate
companies on campus, it may hurt
the smaller landlords in town at an
even greater degree.
Joon-Young Chung, a Ross
School of Business graduate, said
hechosetoliveinhiscurrentapart-
ment because of its location, cost
and space, adding that he tried to
avoid high-rise apartments around
campus because of the price.
Chungsaid he thinks thereason
high-rise apartments like The Var-
sity do well in Ann Arbor is because
students value high quality living,
though this isn't a priority for him.
"Being in college, luxury (in
housing) is not something I need
more than necessity," he said.

'U' to participate
in joint effort with
President Obama

New program
to emphasize
manufacturing
technology in U.S.
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
ManagingNews Editor
University President Mary
Sue Coleman joined President
Barack Obama on Thursday morn-
ing at Carnegie Mellon University
to announce the creation of the
Advanced Manufacturing Partner-
ship - a collaboration between the
government and six universities to
increase the number of advanced
manufacturing jobs in the country
and develop techniques for creating
products more efficiently and inno-
vatively.
At the event, Obama said the
government has invested in the
plan - which was developed by the
Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology - in order to become
more globally competitive by turn-
ing to new manufacturing process-
es and technologies for innovative
uses like clean energy and solar
power.
This decision comes after one-
third of the United States' manu-
facturing jobs have disappeared
within the past 13 years, Obama
said.
"That's why we've invested in
clean energy manufacturing and
new jobs building wind turbines
and solar panels and advanced bat-
teries," he said at the event. "We
have not run out of stuff to make.
We've just got to reinvigorate our
manufacturing sector so that it
leads the world the way it always
has - from paper and steel and cars
to new products that we haven't
even dreamed up yet.
"That's how we're going to
strengthen existing industries;
that's how we're going to spark new
ones," he added. "That's how we're
going to create jobs, grow the mid-
dle class, and secure our economic
leadership."
Coleman expressed a similar
opinion in a June 24 University
press release, saying that the cre-

ation of new industries such as
advanced manufacturing is impor-
tant for the future of the country,
especially the state of Michigan as
it faces a difficult economic period.
"This initiative matters more
to Michigan than any other state,"
she said in the release. "We are at
ground zero for losses in manufac-
turing jobs. But we also are bet-
ter positioned to be the epicenter
of manufacturing innovation. We
know how to retool."
Coleman added that funding
projects that focus on the develop-
ment of smaller business and "the
prototypes they develop" is crucial
to spurring economic growth, since
advancements on the small scale
often translate into large scale pro-
gression.
"(Small businesses') technolo-
gies and tools are the foundation
of large manufacturing compa-
nies," Coleman said. "We are losing
valuable technologies because of
a funding chasm between innova-
tive ideas and small manufacturing
companies being financially posi-
tioned to build to scale. Gap fund-
ing can address this gulf."
According to George Cari-
gnan, associate engineering dean
of research and graduate educa-
tion, the College of Engineering
is no stranger to advanced manu-
facturing research. For the past 14
years, the GM/U-M Collaborative
Research Lab in Advanced Vehicle
Manufacturing has allowed a group
comprised of primarily graduate
students to work with GM research-
ers and manufacture lithium-ion
batteries used in electric cars like
the Chevrolet Volt, he said.
"Manufacturing is a big deal
at the University of Michigan and
has been for many years - several
decades," he said.
Carignan said that the
Advanced Manufacturing Partner-
ship will allow the University to
further benefit from participating
in manufacturing research which
will ultimately have a positive
effect on the state's economy.
He added he is glad to see:the
University recognized for the
efforts that the College of Engi-
neering has put into developing

private organizations that are
willing to collaborate and pro-
vide funding for the expanded
services.
"We're hoping to secure
funding by September so that we
can start finalizing and reaching
out to current and potential rid-
ers," she explained.
If funding is secured by Sep-
tember, AATA will then proceed
with asking the community what
they would like to see improved,
Stasiak said. The plan is to have
the board adopt community
feedback in November and have
the new transit plan implement-
ed by January 2012.
Stasiak said the main reason
AATA is considering a change in
transit plan is because of recur-
ring requests from the communi-
ty for improved transportation,
specifically the request for addi-
tional service to Ypsilanti and
late-night service around Ann
Arbor.
"Currently, we have about
2,200 trips taken by riders daily
(between Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti)," she said. "It is the busiest
corridor in our service."
Stasiak emphasized that the
importance of the new transit

change is the increased involve-
ment of community members in
determining how the funds will
be allocated, and in helping to
make their commutes easier by
allowing them to provide input
about scheduling and conve-
nience.
"Without their role, our
business would be a vacuum,"
she said.
Students on campus
expressed their support of
AATA's proposed changes, not-
ing the impact it may have on
their everyday routines.
Business school sophomore
Danny Agar said that he wel-
comes the upcoming change, as
he usually tries to avoid buses
because it is difficult to follow
their routes.
"I would like to see maybe
if they could streamline about
five to ten routes and have cer-
tain buses that only go that route
instead of playing the game
of jumping around and using
maps," Agar said.
He added that "simplicity is
key," saying that he felt the bus
system would benefit from mak-
ing their routes and destinations
clearer to passengers.
LSA senior Brian Clark said
he takes the AATA bus several
times a week and wishes the
buses ran later, as they usually

complete the final route around
10 p.m., adding he thinks they
should run until 2 a.m. so that
people departing from bars will
have a safe ride home.
Clark also said that travel
times are another prevalent
issue afflicting the bus system,
and at times may make buses a
less desirable method of trans-
portation.
"I have friends in Ypsilanti,
and when I visit them by car
it takes ten minutes, but with
a bus, it takes almost about an
hour," he said. "They should
try to change routes a little bit
to decrease time between Ann
Arbor and Ypsilanti."
Clark added that as the stu-
dent population grows and an
increasing number of people
begin working in Ann Arbor as
the state overcomes economic
difficulties, it's crucial that the
bus system improve so citizens
can have alternatives to automo-
tive transit.
Courtney Duffy, an LSA
senior, said she was also recep-
tive of the potential changes,
particularly because they could
come of assistance in running
errands.
"Personally, more weekend
buses would be appreciated so
I could go to Kroger or Meijer,"
she said.

Do the right thieng
Michigan must legalize same-sex marriage
A dvances in civil rights are indeed gaining momentum.
New York has just become the 6th state (7th if you
count Washington, D.C.) to allow same-sex marriage.
With a President who seems loath to advocate the issue, it's
impressive to see a state generate the internal impetus to push
such important legislation to fruition. Though the willingness
seems to be present, progress is slow, and it's important that
the country follows in the footsteps of the few states that have
taken this initiative. The same-sex marriage ban looks more
outdated every year, and if there was ever a time for the state
of Michigan to make strides, it's now.

Over the course of history, humans
have been driven by three different
stages of motivation. Motivation 1.0
was about sur-
vival (e.g. food).
Motivation 2.0 _
was about punish-
ment and reward
(e.g. money). Dan-
iel Pink, author of
"Drive," argues 1.0
and 2.0 represent ERIK
the old science of TORENBERG
human motiva-_
tion and that we
should implement Motivation 3.0.
Motivation 3.0 consists of three
basic elements: autonomy, the desire
to direct our own lives; mastery, the
drive to improve ourselves in things
which are important to us; purpose,
the longing to contribute to some-
thing larger than ourselves.
Motivation 3.0 presumes that we
want more out of life than just food
and money, but rather we aspire to
"learn, create, and better the world."
We're now seeing this new sci-
ence of motivation demonstrated in
the business world. An increasing
number of businesses are creating
environments which foster inspira-
tion and creativity in the workplace.
Businesses are emphasizing results
over methods, offering employees
more control over how they struc-
ture their time.
We're also seeing the new science
of motivation through the rise of
entrepreneurship and the entrepre-
neurial mindset, which inspire us
to create and choose our own paths
(Autonomy). In addition, it's demon-
strated through the rise in popular-
ity of the 10,000 hour rule - a belief
that says it takes 3 hours a day for
ten years to become an expert in
something (Mastery). Additionally,
we see through the commencement
speakers who encourage us to make
meaning out of life rather than just
money (Purpose).
And, finally, we're beginning to
see Motivation 3.0 in education.
"The New Culture of Learning," a
recent book by Professor John Seely
Brown, provides examples of teach-
ers who engage students' internal
motivations and tailor their classes
accordingly. At the University of
Michigan, the -application for the
Ford School of Public Policy asks
students how they want to change
the world. A recent student move-
ment titled 1000 Voices rallied
for more action-based education
around campus, conveying students'
desire to learn not only through
text, but also experience.

Enter Uncollege, which describes
itself as a "social movement empow-
ering you to create tomorrow - with
or without letters after your name."
Uncollege is a blog with an
insightful, even provocative mani-
festo. It's a public forum for people
to discuss pedagogy, self-directed
learning and the current state of
higher education. It's a community
for students who are intrinsically
motivated and who are looking to
learn from each other.
The social movement is led by
Dale Stephens, a 19 year-old Cali-
fornian entrepreneur. After being
homeschooled since fifth grade, he
attended Hendrix College in Arkan-
sas before dropping out. He states:
"The direct impact I could have on
the world by engaging the commu-
nity around UnCollege far exceeded
the impact I could have by complet-
We Want more
out of life than
food and money.
ing homework assignments."
But Dale's position should be clar-
ified. Dale, who has been featured
on CNN, FOX and NPR, states: "I'm
not against school; I'm for learning,
and I think that learning happens
everywhere - not just in the class-
room." Uncollege aims to design the
ideal environment for learning, and
prove that such an environment can
be cost-effective. Dale's efforts have
gained a significant following.
However, Uncollege is not with-
out critics. Dale's column on CNN
received negative comments in addi-
tion to praise. It may be natural tobe
skeptical of changes to tradition. But,
at the very least, let's have a discus-
sion. Let's explore what 1000 Voices
and Uncollege have in common.
First, they involve students who ask
not only what they are doing, but
also why they are doing it. Second,
they involve students who rethink
what they need to learn and how
they learn best. Third, they involve
students who think about how they
can attain a better education.
In other words, college students
today are seeking autonomy, mas-
tery and purpose. We, perhaps more
than any other generation, march to
the beat of Motivation 3.0.

Same-sex marriage has a few
avenues of potential legaliza-
tion, one being through federal
law. President Barack Obama
has condemned the Defense of
Marriage Act, a federal law that
defines marriage as a sanctity
between a man and a woman.
Additionally, DOMA doesn't
require states to honor same-
sex marriages performed in
other states. While it is neces-
sary to strike down this preju-
diced legislation, condemning
it is hardly making a bold state-
ment. Obama has said nothing
in support of same-sex mar-
riage and simply doesn't sup-
port a federal marriage law,
preferring to leave the legality
of same-sex marriage up to the
states. The country must have a
universal policy protecting civil
rights of homosexuals, and must
have a strong figure to instigate
it. Obama needs to rally the cur-

rent momentum and push for a
federal law that allows same-
sex marriage.
In the event that Obama
doesn't push for a federal law
regarding the issue, it will remain
up to each state to make its own
laws to this effect. Unfortunately,
Michigan is one of the minor-
ity of states with a constitution
that bans same-sex marriage. It
even has specific language that
forbids honoring the benefits of
domestic partnerships and civil
unions awarded in other states.
It is because of this constitutional
provision that the Michigan state
legislature recently attempted to
fine the University for extending
benefits to cohabiting adults.
In a state that is often a fore-
runner in progress, it's sad to see
it stoop so low and share rank
with other states in the rejection
of equality. In this current social
climate, it's commendable that

a few states gave gay men and
women rights that they should
have always had. New York's
laudable legislation would not
have been possible without the
initiative of Republicans who
rejected their party's ethos.
Even with the potential backlash
of conservatives and religious
groups, there was an acknowl-
edgement that individual rights
are sometimes more important
than public will. As Michigan
lawmakers push forward with
the extension of marriage rights
for same-sex couples, it will be
important to remember this
fact: Michigan's government has
a duty to the public that elected
them, but they also have a duty
to minorities who might be dis-
enfranchised by a close-minded
majority. Michigan should fol-
low New York and the five states
before it and legalize same-sex
marriage.

Muddy media

"I frankly, am stunned."
- Rod Blagojevich, in response to his 17 guilty verdicts.

Of all the acclaimed and influ-
ential works that political theorist
Hannah Arendt wrote in her life,
"Lying in Poli-
tics" stands out
to me as the most
timeless and
relevant pieces
about American
politics. Arendt's
work discussed
the controversial MAX
Pentagon Papers LEVENSTEIN
- top secret
documents that
were leaked to the public by Daniel
Ellsberg in 1971. These papers con-
tained information about the Viet-
namWar and other conflicts around
the region that proved that both
President Johnson and President
Nixon knowingly lied and misled
the American people and Congress
about their military efforts.
Lying in politics has proven to
be not just for the presidents of the
1960's; Americans today have faced
it numerous times, especially on
issues surrounding overseas mili-
tary operations. We are skeptical of
our government, as we should be,
and rely on both our intuition and
media sources to guide our senti-
ments about our elected politicians.
Butwhatifourtrustedmediasourc-
es are no longer reliable? What if the
things we read and hear from news
sources do not reflect the truth in
politics, but exactly the opposite?
We would no longer be able to fully
judge our politicians or form a sen-
sible'opinion ofourgovernment and
national issues, thus virtually inca-
pacitating the American voter.
In a recent segment of "The Daily
Show," Jon Stewart makes a com-
plete mockery of Fox News by list-
ing various statements made by its
hosts and pundits that were proven
to be false by the non-partisan
political fact checkinggroup, politi-
fact.com. Among these were claims
like Obama has overseen the gen-
eration of more U.S. debt than all
other presidents combined, nation-
al health care will include death
panels and Governor Rick Scott's
approval ratings are up. To be sure,
this is not just a Fox issue, as false
or exaggerated statements are quite
common on many "news" stations
on television. Start worrying.
I am fully aware that cable news
outlets are partisan, as it is com-
monly understood that Fox News
leans right and its counterpart,
MSNBC, leans left. This leads each
to present events and issues in a dif-
ferent light, supporting the political

ideology that is most convenient.
This fact, however undesirable, is
something we have come to accept
and put up with.
What we cannot accept are out-
right lies. We cannot allow sources
that call themselves "news" to have
zero respect for the ethics of real
journalism and blatantly lie to the
American public. These examples
that Stewart pointed out could
never be considered nonpartisan.
There is no room for ideological
interpretation in these statements
as they are either true or false. The
debt under President Obama can be
researched and compared against
all debt in the past. Death panels
are a made up idea created to scare
Americans away from any notion of
supporting a Democratic agenda.
Misrepresenting poll numbers to
say that Republican Governor Rick
Scott's ratings are up, when in fact
they were not.
Lying isn't
reserved for
politicians.
How can we listen to media if we
never know what is fact or fiction?
There is no possible way to know
how I should feel on an issue, or
which candidate I should vote for, if
the only sources I have available lie
to me Is it not enough that we are
fearful of our government lying to
us, much less the media?
Unfortunately, the print news-
papers that have respected the eth-
ics of journalism and truthfulness
are dying in America, leaving the
news industry to those on televi-
sion and online. Americans no lon-
ger demand truth in their news,
but rather entertaining stories that
they can gossip about with others.
Sensationalism is not news, nor is
it truth. We need to shift our view
of media and demand that it change
from entertainment to informative
discussion. We have plenty of other
sources of entertainment, but news
should not be one of them.
Arendt wrote about the dangers
of lying in politics and stated that
a free press would help prevent it
from being commonplace. How can
we ensure that our media is held to
the same standard?

Trendy philanthropy

It seems as though philanthro-
py and consumerism are becom-
ing ever more indistinguishable.
Now, you can
accumulate
donations
for a cause
while brows- -
ing the web ,i
using Good-
Search.com or
you can buy a ANNA
pair of shoes CLEMENTS
from TOMS
and know that
because of your purchase, a pair
of shoes will be donated to a
needy child in a disadvantaged
country. You can order textbooks
from Better World Books, which
raises money for literacy and
education as well as donating to
overseas literacy programs. You
can even support the Ann Arbor
Public Schools by shopping at the
PTO thrift shop.
Especially in the current eco-
nomic climate, we see it as our
duty as citizens to buy more and
support the economy. The solu-
tion seems clear: If people buy
more, then there will be more
jobs available, more tax money
going to the government and
more satisfaction all around.
This may not be as beneficial as
it seems, however. Even if the
corporations from which you buy
your shoes and books are donat-
ing things to people in need, it's
important not to let that turn into
a red herring, taking attention
away from the various problems
with over-consumption.
While it is undoubtedly good
for companies to be aware of their
responsibility to the greater com-
munity (on whatever scale they
may conceive of), philanthropy
and consumerism must remain
discernable from each other -
confusing the two is detrimental
to both. The goal of business is
normally to make a profit, where-

as the goal of philanthropy is to
promote the welfare of others.
The two are not congruent. Nev-
ertheless, businesses have found
ways to practice philanthropy
in ways that, through improving
their image, actually promote
profit.
The problem with this spurs
from placing primary attention
on the consumerist aspects of
philanthropic projects, rather
than on their goals and achieve-
ments. Don't get me wrong, I love
the bake sales in Angell Hall. But
when you're being charitable it's
important to make sure that the
ways in which you go about it
don't make people ignorant of the
sources they're supporting.
For example, the TOMS shoes
website includes extensive infor-
mation about where, how, and
why they give shoes to needy
children around the world. What
is not mentioned on the site is
where, how and by whom the
shoes are made. They sell a line
of vegan shoes, but the materials
going into their other shoes may
come from cows that were raised
in factory farms and spent their
lives being overfed in confined
spaces, thus adding methane to
the atmosphere and contribut-
ing to global climate change.
Furthermore, carting loads of
shoes overseas causes additional
emissions from planes, and dis-
tributing free shoes may put
local industries in developing
economies out of business. Of
course, this is not an overall con-
demnation of TOMS; it's simply
a suggestion to look beyond the
donations a business makes.
My point is not to criticize
TOMS shoes or any other indus-
try that strives to give back as
well as gain. But it is clear that we
should not let philanthropy put a
blinder over our eyes, so that we
cease to examine these business-
es as critically as we would any

other. Furthermore, for student
organizations to promote simi-
lar business behavior is also fine,
as long as the students that par-
ticipate in them recognize that
what they are doing is providing
free advertising, not community
service or organizing or fund-
raising. I say this as a member of
SOLE (Students Organizing for
Labor and Economic Equality),
which, for about a year, has been
promoting Alta Gracia, the union-
made University apparel supplier.
Clearly, if people are looking for
a pair of shoes or a University
hoodie, then they are not doing
anything wrong by buying from
the union-made or philanthropic
sources rather than the alterna-
tives. It's just not OK for consum-
erism to become the new charity,
and for people to assume that by
buying something they are having
a net positive impact on the world.
It's vital to look
past corporate
charity.
Actually figuring out the net
impact of shopping in philan-
thropic stores is tricky, but it is
important to look at more than
just charity when judging an
industry's imact. If the sources
of the goods are unsustainable
- either socially, through labor
standards or environmentally -
then aid to charity is most likely
not worth the damage that those
donations may cause. If we want
to actually put our money where
our ideologies are, then it's
important to see beyond corpo-
rate charity.

course work and degree programs
that cater to producing graduates
who can help stimulate manufac-
turing in the United States.
Along with the University of
Michigan, Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Georgia Institute
of Technology, Stanford Uni-
versity and University of Cali-
fornia-Berkeley will work with
manufacturers like Johnson &
Johnson, Honeywell and Stryker
to develop and research useful
methods and products.
Obama said that by engaging
in projects like this, the nation can
strengthen production of goods

and services that will make the
U.S. more competitively interna-
tionally.
"The concept of advanced
manufacturing is not complicat-
ed," Obama said. "It means how
do we do things better, faster,
cheaper to design and manufac-
ture superior products that allow
us to compete all over the world,"
Carignan echoed Obama's
sentiment, saying the country has
lost a lot of manufacturing jobs,
particularlyto countries overseas,
which can be resolved through
"the reinvigoration of the manu-
facturing enterprise," He added
that the lack of emphasis on the
importance of manufacturing jobs
in the country led to the field's col-
lapse, and he hopes the country
can regain its "competitive edge"

with a stronger emphasis on dif-
ferent manufacturingtechniques.
In a June 24 press release,
Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich)said
the new program will play a cru-
cial role in improving the state's
economy.
"Other nations are invest-
ing and creating public-private
partnerships in advanced manu-
facturing, energy efficiency and
other key sectors, and if we fail to
match their investments, America
and American workers will be left
behind," he said in the release.
"To succeed, the effort announced
today cannot be an ending - it
must be an urgent boost to a part-
nership among industry, academia
and government to help our man-
ufacturers compete around the
world."

ORDINANCE
From Page 1
Arbor City Attorney Stephen
Postema proposed that council
specify the specifics regarding the
issue of permitting medical mari-
juana in the city.
Sandi Smith (D-Ward 1) -
another strong proponent of the
ordinances - said the while the
process was extensive, she felt it
was necessary in order to develop
legislation that best serves Michi-
gan residents on an issue they find
significant.
"I supportit because it's some-
thing that the state of Michigan
voters have indicated is important
to them," she said.
Smith added that city coun-
cil spent more than a year debat-

ing the issue because she feels
the state did a poor job in laying
out the city's responsibilities in
regards to medical marijuana
policy.
Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5)
echoed Smith's sentiments, say-
ing that the city had little state
guidance on these ordinances and
that he was particularly pleased
with the anonymity clause that
ensured caregivers' names would
not be recorded with the city.
However, Anglin said he
would like to eventually see addi-
tional work done to the zoning
ordinance because, while it guar-
antees that no marijuana will be
sold near grade schools, it does
not factor in preschools and other
childcare facilities.
City Council members Ste-
phen Rapundalo (D-Ward 2)

and Marcia Higgins (D-Ward 4)
voted against the ordinances, and
Tony Derezinski (D-Ward 2) was
absent for the vote.
Rapundalo said he voted
against the ordinances because
he believes the discrepancy
between local and federal law
may potentially hinder the coun-
cil's approved plans. He added he
would have liked to wait and see
what the state policy would be
regarding this issue, as they will
also be working on similar legisla-
tion.
Rapundalo added that he voted
against the ordinances because
they didn't include enough regu-
lation to protect neighborhoods.
Dennis Hayes, an Ann Arbor
attorney with a background in
drug-related legalities, said the
ordinances took a long time to

pass because the council started
with "highly regulated" legisla-
tion and that eventually became
more lenient as council realized
certain technicalities may impede
patients from seeking help from
caregivers.
The recently approved ordi-
nances were an attempt to dem-
onstrate that the city would be
stricter in regards to marijuana
than it has been in the past, Hayes
said.
He added that because the
topic is usually taboo in politics -
except in more presumably liberal
cities like Ann Arbor and Berkeley
- politicians strive to adhere anti-
marijuana policy.
However, he argued that poli-
ticians should discuss it more
openly, noting 74 percent of peo-
ple in Ann Arbor voted for legal-

izing medical marijuana in 2008,
more than the percentage who
voted for Obama in the presiden-
tial election.
"It's somewhere between stu-
pid and ignorant how we treat
medical marijuana and marijuana
in general," he said.
Chuck Ream, owner of the
dispensary MedMAR Pharma-
ceuticals Inc., said that while he
has some concerns about the pub-
lished document, Ream praised
the council for stepping out of
their comfort zone and learning
all about the medical marijuana
industry before voting on the
finalized ordinances.
"It was a good process because
the council was learning all the
way ... When they learned some-
thing new, they made changes,"
he said.

HathiTrust aims to expand digital collection
* of resources through orphan works project

To increase access
to digital works,
'U' launches new
program
By BETHANY BIRON
Editor in Chief
After seven years and the digi-
tization of millions of volumes as
part of the Google Books Library
Project, the University may soon
be able to boast an even larger
number with the help of the newly
announced orphan works project.
John Wilkin, associate Uni-
versity. librarian, said the orphan
works project is an initiative to
identify books that may have
unknowinglycrossedintothepub-
lit domain after copyright holders
have deceased. The project will
play an integral role in helping to
augment the HathiTrust Digital
Library - a collaborative venture
between the University and 52
other libraries around the world
to digitize works and make them
accessible to the public.
Wilkin, who is also the execu-
tive director of HathiTrust, said

that while the Google Books
Library Project has been success-
ful thus far in allowing for the dig-
itization of a multitude of works
from each of the campus libraries,
it ultimately has been hindered
by copyright law that may ren-
der a particular work unusable
until it receives approval from
the rights holder. Engaging in the
orphan works project allows for
an increased amount of resources
to be available to University mem-
bers as well as the general public,
he said.
"I think there's a lot of hope
that when we digitize the library's
collection that it transforms
things, and it does, but so much is
constrained by copyright," Wilkin
said. "So we've been able to open
up far more than we ever have
before."
According to Paul Courant,
the University's dean of librar-
ies, the process of finding copy-
right holders is "laborious" since
it entails extensive and thorough
research. Additionally, he said it
requires consulting with various
book retailers to ensure that the
work is not on sale somewhere,
and thus making it no longer eli-
gible to be considered an orphan.

He added that despite the dif-
ficultly, allowing these works to be
accessible to the campus commu-
nity is important in establishing
an environment that fosters the
sharing and utilization of schol-
arly information and resources.
"We've always wanted to
make use of these works ... we
decided it was very natural since
all of our students and faculty
already are completely eligible to
read these books," Courant said.
"We're just making it easier to
read them in a somewhat differ-
ent way.
Similarly, University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham said
the orphan works project is a cru-
cial part of the HathiTrust's mis-
sion to provide access to literature
and scholarly work to the greater
campus community.
"This is part of the library's
mission to preserve knowledge
and to share knowledge, espe-
cially with their own communi-
ty, and this kind of just fits right
along with what their goals and
aspirations are for the University
library," Cunningham said.
Wilkin echoed Courant's
sentiment that the process will
be challenging, and said that

attempting to prove the absence
of a copyright owner can be dif-
ficult, particularly in making the
final decision to include the work
in the database.
"It's really about trying to
prove a negative and those sorts
of processes are very hard," he
said. "You're trying to prove that
there is no rights holder out there,
but the process of making that
determination is extraordinarily
difficult and we've got a nice crew
of people with legal backgrounds
working on this."
Additionally, Wilkin said a
website will be developed in about
three weeks that will list items
the University has determined
as orphans so that the public can
peruse the collection and uncover
if they hold rights to any of the
works. Alleged orphans will sub-
sequently have 90 days before
they can be declared as part of the
project.
If a work is published after
the 90 days and a copyright holder
claims rights to the work, Wilkin
said HathiTrust will immediately
deactivate access to the particular
work and hold a discussion with
the rights owner to determine
future action. However, Wilkin

said for the most part living copy-
right holders are enthusiastic
about being included in the data-
base and that the University often
has authors contacting them from
around the world to be included in
the project.
"Typically when we contact
a rights holder about a work, the
rights holder says 'Oh please open
access of that work to everybody
in the world,"' he said.
He added that the orphan
works project at the University
is one of the first of its kind, and
while similar efforts have been
made at other institutions, it is the
forefront of a new program that
will likely attract notice from oth-
ers around the nation.
"It would be wrong to say
orphan works digitization hasn't
happened, but it hasn't hap-
pened for the published record
in this way, and not on any sort of
scale," he said. "We are singular
in this regard. We will be doing
something that the world will be
watching and I mean that quite
seriously. Other research librar-
ies are going to be paying close
attention to this and it will begin
to shift their activity as they come
along."

'Beginners' asserts the
solemn beauty of reality

U2 impresses Michigan with
more than just a rock concert

By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
Motion pictures promise
an idealized version of life
as we experience it - the
words
feel genu- ****
ine but
come out Beginners
so much At the State
more
clever, Focus Features
and the
faces are
prettier than could ever
transpire out in the real
world. It follows that film-
making comes to be this
constant push and pull
between aesthetic and prag-
matism. Too much style can
collapse substance, but sub-
stance without the window
dressing is stale, unoriginal.
At its onset, "Beginners"
threatens to fall victim to
the former. Characters with
yuppie dinner party names:
Oliver, Anna, a dog named
Arthur. A meet cute at a
Halloween party where the
girl has laryngitis and has
to communicate through a
tiny notebook while dressed
as Charlie Chaplin. A pul-
sating voiceover by Ewan
McGregor ("I Love You
Phillip Morris"), which
intonates things like "This
is the sun in 1955. And the
stars. And the President."
And "This is what sadness
looks like" (flash neon, hip-
ster color on screen). These
situations and lines, which
seem to come out of your
standard, precious story-
book romance, feel a bit like
free radicals bombarding
the surface without much of
a unifier - at least at first.
That coveted unifier
reveals itself as, of course,
grief - the underlying story
being that Oliver's recently-
out father Hal (Christopher
Plummer, "The Last Sta-
tion") has just passed away,
leaving his son forlorn,
alone to deal with his own
fractured emotions.
Consider such a scene: A
Jack Russell terrier recog-

Arthur consults his owner, Oliver, for advice with his leading bitch.

nizes the head of his recently
deceased owner and joyous-
ly bounds down the hallway
to meet his master. For that
sustained second, Oliver too
believes that his father has
come back from the dead,
his face lighting up in antici-
pation. But the man turns
around, and it turns out to
be just the old guy that lives
across the hall. "Sorry about
that," Oliver apologizes. He
turns the key to his apart-
ment. Once inside, he breaks
down into a series of dry
sobs.
There are analogous tab-
leaux peppering the film's
many lovesick sequences.
And once the film does let
itself seethe a little before
settling down into its own
melancholic skin, it starts
to breathe. We can admire
M6lanie Laurent's ("Inglou-
rious Basterds") darling
little fishtail braid (which
had me secretly plotting
YouTube tutorial searches
on the drive home), but what
keeps us in the theater is
the film's spirit, potent with
truths of aging, deteriora-
tion, fabrication and family
values. In time, we realize
that there's something gen-
tly organic - special, even
- about the film, a beating
fist of a heart that contracts
and expands with every new
pulsation.
Perhaps this derives from
writer and director Mike

Mills's ("Thumbsucker")
true-to-life experience with
death, having lost his own
father to cancer a few years
ago. It's unlikely though that
the director has met any-
body as uncannily lovely as
the inimitable Laurent, who,
in all her Manic Pixie Dream
Girl glory, permeates with
the freshness of hurt, aban-
donment and youth. Mills's
own doppelganger is played
by the warm, crease-lined
face of one Mr. McGregor, a
face that breaks into a joyous
grin at our scarcest expecta-
tion beneath his insulated
cocoon of loneliness. -
The true goal of Mills's
sophomore project was not
to make a cute little film
about falling in love at an
unexpected time (though
this does take center stage,
especially toward the end),
but to take a more synoptic
viewofthehumancondition.
Where "Beginners" suc-
ceeds splendidly is in com-
municating the complexities
of living a life bracketed by
tragedy and incomprehensi-
ble happiness. Contentment,
it tells us, can never be expe-
rienced without a modicum
of grief framing the corners.
Life is not about burying
oneself into numb apathy -
it's about embracing these
emotional extremes, to fully
breathe in a style but also
to drink deep from the sub-
stance.

Anything less from U2 would've been a
disappointment.
Mixing timeless music with prodigious
theatrics and their penchant for social
action, U2 put on a soaring spectacle of a
concert that only they were capable of pull-
ing off.
On a picture-perfect summer night last
Sunday in East Lansing, almost a year to the
date of their originally scheduled concert
that was postponed due to lead singer Bono's
back surgery, U2 brought their record break-
ing, globetrotting 3600 Tour to Michigan.
But before U2 burst into their set, the
always whimsical Florence Welch, of Flor-
ence + the Machine, kicked off the show,
prancing around U2's masterpiece of a stage
as if it were her own personal playground.
Donned in an elegantly flowing magenta
dress that paralleled the energy of her per-
formance - not to mention her fiery red hair
- she soulfully belted hits from her album
Lungs, culminating with crowd-pleaser
"Dog Days are Over."
U2 hit the stage with an unexpected
urgency, quickly tearing through the opener
"Even Better Than The Real Thing." Despite
the Irish quartet's unbounded energy, the
nearly 70,000 in Spartan Stadium were
slow to warm up to the band's manic pace
through the sultry "Mysterious Ways" and
"I Will Follow" - the sprawling single from
their 1980 debut album Boy.
The band was right at home on the four-
legged stage, affectionately nicknamed
"The Claw", that soared 170 feet over the
field. They never seemed lost on the mas-
sive structure - Bono and the gang paraded
around the circular catwalk surrounding
the stage and across bridges spanning the
crowd.
At times it seemed like more than just a
rock concert. Bono used his pulpit to share
his political views while images of the upris-
ings in the Middle East flashed on video
screens and The Edge played the thump-
ing guitar intro to "Sunday Bloody Sunday."
During "Walk On," a montage of Burmese
democracy-advocate Aung San Suu Kyi
praised her release from 20 years of house
arrest.
Although many bands would have been
overwhelmed with the task of commanding
a stadium, Bonn sought to build a relation-
ship with the crowd and establish a more
intimate feel. This was particularly evident
during an acoustic rendition of "Stay (Far
Way and So Close)" in which Bono emulated
a performance at Dooley's, a club U2 played
in East Lansing 20 years ago on one of their
first world tours.

The band seemed to relish playing on a
college campus, revering the activism of col-
lege students around the nation and honor-
ing the 50th infirmary of the Peace Corps.
"We never made it to university ourselves,"
Bono told the audience. "I think Edge made
it two weeks and I made it a week. U2 became
our university. Rolling Stone became our
textbook."
As dusk settled in Spartan Stadium, a light
breeze blew the smell of marijuana over sec-
tion 9 and the audience came alive singing
the opening verses of "I Still Haven't Found
What I'm Looking For" all the while Bono
stood on the edge of the stage with his arms
spread wide allowing the thousands of voic-
es, united as one, to flow over him.
The vigor that quickly transferred from
the band to the crowd was further acceler-
ated as Bono became increasingly conversa-
tional with the audience, even cheering "Go
Green, Go White" (much to our dismay) and
venerating the state's natural beauty. "What
a magical landscape we got here," Bono
told the crowd, before mentioning guitarist
The Edge's desire to retire to a cabin on the
shores of Lake Michigan, which was met by
raucous applause.
With a blue smoky haze hanging over the
band, Bono leaned into the mic, delivering a
poignant rendition of "Pride (In the Name
of Love)" and invoking the middle-aged
women in our section to turn to each other
and sing along, "Free at last, they took your
life/They could not take your pride."
The otherworldly "Beautiful Day" fea-
tured a video appearance by astronaut Mark
Kelly, husband of Congresswoman Gabrielle
Giffords, singing along from the Interna-
tional Space Station. "See the bird with the
leaf in her mouth," Kelly said as Bono's eyes
turned toward the heavens and joined in:
"After the flood all the colors came out."
The performance itself was interwoven
with themes of time and space - notions
the band itself seemed to transcend as they
first entered the stadiumwith David Bowie's
1969 hit "Space Oddity" playing eerily in the
background.
The magic continued with hit after hit,
integrating classic tunes like "Where the
Streets Have No Name" with "Moment of
Surrender", one of the few bright spots on
U2's indifferently reviewed 2009 album, No
Line on the Horizon.
After ending the show with two encores
and a tribute to saxophonist Clarence Clem-
ons covering Springsteen's "Jungleland",
Bono was clearly speechless. He was unable
to articulate his appreciation for the thun-
dering standing ovation he received from
the audience. As the crowd filtered out of the
stadium, U2 once again proved the steadfast
timelessness oftheir music that has spanned
generatios.

Pixar drops the sappiness for 'Cars 2'

Sequel is a departure
from heartwarming
r gadgetry
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
Let's first get this straight: "Cars
2" is no "Toy Story." It's not going
to make you cry, hug your fam-
ily or even think
particularly hard.
While "Ratatouil- ***
le" took a group
of smelly mice CarS 2
and made them At Quality16
kind of round and and Rave
adorable, "Cars 2"
is as imperson- Disney
able and utilitar-
ian as cars can
be - all right angles, sharp exte-
riors and shiny paint jobs. In fact,
It wouldn't be remiss to call it the

worst movie Pixar has ever made, if
you're judging by that kind of tear-
jerking standard.
But this "emotional deficiency"
(for lack of a better term) is not a
question of biting off more than one
can chew. No critic, no matter how
much they might have hated the
film, can fairly say that Pixar failed
in its mission. After all, we know
what the gazillion-dollar company
is capable of, having proved that
gleaming hunks of metal can be as
innocuous and disarming as puppy
dog tails ("Wall-E" being the evi-
dence). If Pixar had wanted to make
another charming parable about
materialism or whatever, it could
have done so with panache to spare.
So, OK, now that we've estab-
lished that the whole boom-shoot-
whiz thing was purposeful, there
are two ways to approach this. One
more sinister, and vaguely more
probable explanation, is that Pixar
sold out - more interested in mer-

chandising profits and box office
sales than genuine artistic integrity.
The other, more positive one, is that
desire for breadth and diversity won
out over depth.
Look at it this way: Does every
single Pixar movie need to be a
heartrendingly beautiful tale of
love, family and loneliness? We
cried at "Toy Story," "Wall-E,"
"Up," "Monsters, Inc." and "Find-
ing Nemo" because they tugged at
our emotional heartstrings. But if
you think about it, it's really all the
same story: Protagonist X is left
bereft of all companions for Y rea-
sons and has to make a journey to
Place Z. He/she/it succeeds. Audi-
ence collectively sniffles.
Isn't it plausible that Pixar might
have wanted to add a little variety
to the tried and true formula? That
maybe instead of having a contest of
who could put Kleenex out of busi-
ness, they just wanted to make this
really fun, mindless action movie

and screw the rest?
The filmgoer is a fickle fiend.
A few more movies later and we
would have all thrown our hands up
and been all like, Enough with the
transcendentally moving garbage!
Pixar is boring.'
And whatever a person might say
about "Cars 2," boring is not one of
them. There's crazy 007 espionage,
cool gadgetry and kickass stunt-
work that revs and roars with the
exhilaration of a wild goose chase,
as well as a truly sexy James Bond-
ish protagonist by the improbable
name of Finn McMissile (played
by resident Brit Michael Caine
of "Inception" fame). The plot,
in brief, follows the gas-guzzling
circuit of competitive racing, and
contains in its pages a mildly inter-
esting conspiracy involving "lem-
ons" and an imaginary alternative
fuel called "Allinol." In short, it's
an action movie kind of story, one
that exists mainly for the purpose

of blowing a lot of stuff up (Pixar
class intact, of course).
Rather, it is in a character, not
storytelling, where the company
takes its first faltering step. Class
clown and perennial sidekick Tow
Mater (Larry the Cable Guy, "Wit-
less Protection"), who grated in
the first installment, hits a new
low in his larger role as the village-
idiot-come-savior to the automo-
bile industry. Thank goodness for
those Britons, because it's all one
can do from throwingsomething at
the screen every time Mater comes
on in his rusty, drawling Southern
accent.
And while it's excusable for
Pixar to want to make an action
movie - its own animated ver-
sion of "Transformers" with a hot
Megan Fox to match the swelter-
ing sun rays beaming down outside
- what's not so excusable is hiring
freaking Larry the Cable Guy to
star in it.

Pitbull saturates 'Planet Pit' with beats for the discotheque

OK

By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Arts Writer
Pitbull has a lot of nicknames,
most of which he bestowed upon
himself. Mr. International and
Mr. Worldwide
are the most apt
considering his
latest record,
Planet Pit, which bull
is packed with Planet Pit
electro-pop
bangers chroni- Mr. 305 Inc.
cling the play-
boy's worldwide
philandering.
In this rapidly globalizing
world, the Cuban-American rap-
per surveys the planet and deems
all borders permeable, using his
enternational sex appeal and
seductive Spanglish as a diplo-
matic tool to get in the pants of
women all around the world. And
one gets the feeling that nearly
all the sweaty, cosmopolitan jams
studding his latest party album
Ovould be welcome in any club or
discotheque.
The entire album is like a fusion
restaurant, as it samples beats and
sounds from all over the world
to create a multicultural sonic
feast. Pitbull steers away from a

virtual roll-call of rappers and
pop stars on "Pause," one of the
sexiest songs on the album, and
flies solo on this reggaeton track.
Caribbean drums and electro-pop
combine perfectly to create a spicy
song, which has Pitbull switching
back and forth between rapping in
Spanish and English. It's humid
and hypnotic.
Enyique Iglesias lends a hand
on "Come 'N' Go," a song riddled
with strange euphemisms for sex,
like the inscrutable, 21st-century
pick-up line "Mami you're the
internet / And I'm looking for a
download." But if one ignores the
pair's decidedly un-sexy boast-
ing about their respective sexual
prowess, the rum-saturated, top
40-bound track is perfect for after
midnight. Pitbull handles seduc-
tion for grinding co-eds as he
whispers "That's right" over and
over.
Despite a solid roster of hits
on the record, Pitbull stumbles
occasionally. The throwaway
sing-along song "Something for
the DJs" is pretty much unlisten-
able. Of course, the consummate
globetrotting DJ and producer,
David Guetta, joins Pitbull on
this electro-house heavy song.
Unfortunately, Pitbull's creepy

twist on childhood rhymes will
leave listeners cold as he horrif-
ingly implores "If you're sexy and
you know it clap your hands!" and
asks "How much wood can a wood
chop, chop / Ifa wood could chop,
could chop would!" Despite the
terrible lyricism, Guetta some-
what salvages the track with his
universally appealing beats.
Slowing it down, Pitbull opens
up on the requisite confessional
"Castle Made of Sand" with Kelly
Rowland's soaring, but melodra-
matic vocal stylings and new-
comer Jamie Drastik spitting a
lack-luster verse. This song has
Pitbull marveling at his own suc-
cess despite his rough, childlike
rapping, "If you know what I
come from, know what I've been
through / You think there should
have been another outcome." Even
though Rowland's pop tart singing
undermines and clutters the song,
it's hard to resist a track where
hyper-masculine Pitbull says,
"Thank you mom for making me
a man."
As Pitbull says on the intro track
"Mr Worldwide," Mr. 305 takes on
the world without forgetting his
Cuban-Miami roots on Planet Pit.

Kampfer, Stanley Cup set to visit Ann Arbor

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Steven Kampfer took the hand-
off from Tuukka Rask and raised
the silver Stanley Cup skyward,
looking up into the rafters at Rog-
ers Arena in Vancouver.
The season didn't go the way
he'd imagined, but the ending was
better than he ever hoped.
Althought injured, Kampfer
won the Stanley Cup as a mem-
ber of the Boston Bruins on June
15. The former defenseman on the
Michigan hockey team will get to
spend some quality time with the
legendary trophy.
But he won't take it to Disney
World or Disneyland, as some
have done before him. Nor will
he take it to a horse stall and let a
Kentucky Derby winner eat out of
the Cup as Ed Olczyk did in 1994.
And he most certainly will not use
it for a baptism in Sweden, like
Tomas Holmstrom did in 2008.
Kampfer has plans for a far
more traditional date with the
Stanley Cup.
"I'm a firm believer of 'You've
got to remember your roots,' "
Kampfer said.
a Kampfer intends to bring the
celebrated trophy around Ann
Arbor and to Yost Ice Arena - his
old stomping ground. Kampfer left
the Wolverines only one year ago.

He wants to show the Cup
to Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson and to the rest of the
coaching staff as a sign of appreci-
ation. He may not be at Michigan
anymore, but Kampfer under-
stands, now more than ever, the
impact that Michigan has had on
him as a person and.as a player.
After beginning' the season
with the Providence Bruins in the
American Hockey League, Kamp-
fer arrived in Boston in early
December. Upon arriving with the
Bruins, he knew that he was going
to get playing time. Kampfer also
knew that the amount of time he
spent on the ice was going to be
determined by how well he played.
This was nothing new to him.
Playing for Michigan had pre-
pared him for this.
"The thing with Michigan is
that Red runs it like a profession-
al organization there," Kampfer
said. "Something that Red's been
known for is that you have to go in
and you have to earn everything.
So when I stepped into Boston, I
think that was one of the things
that helped me."
Kampfer was prepared for
every little thing he came across.
Whether it was facing adversity
or earning his spot in the rotation,
Michigan's presence was always
felt.
Even though the Jackson, Mich.

native joined the Michigan hockey
team as an established recruit, he
admits that nothing prepared him
for life in the National Hockey
League as much as playing for
Berenson and the Wolverines.
He maintains that one of the
most underrated aspects of play-
ing for the Michigan hockey pro-
gram is the opportunity to play
with and practice against great
players on a daily basis.
But still, his praise for the
coaching staff is endless.
The expectations were set high
for him as a Wolverine - they
were set high for all of his team-
mates - because Berenson and his
assistants really wanted everyone
to succeed, and they pushed him
to improve. They helped build him
into the player he is now.
"Red's a phenomenal coach,"
Kampfer said. "I learned so much
from him. I learned so much from
all three coaches. They really help
you get ready for the next level."
And Kampfer hasn't stopped
learning from them.
He continued to keep in contact
with all three coaches after grad-
uating from Michigan last year,
and received instruction from the
coaches throughout the season.
Every couple of weeks, he would
talk with assistant coach Billy
Powers about his recent games
and how he could make adjust-

Whitten selected as ninth coach in program history

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
For the last five years, Andrew
Sapp and Chris Whitten worked
side-by-side, helping the Michigan
men's golf team reach new heights
while transforming it into an elite
program.
But when Sapp stepped down
from his position as head coach and
departed from the golf program
just over a week ago to become the
head coach at North Carolina, the
tandem was split up and Whitten's
future was uncertain.
But before he left, Sapp recom-
mended to the Athletic Depart-
ment that they promote Whitten,
citing the impact he had on the
Wolverines' improvement over the
last five years.
Sapp voiced that Whitten was a
perfect fit to fill the head coaching

position.
Sapp wasn't sure how much his
words meant to the administra-
tion, but he hoped that they would
listen.
And to the surprise of very few,
Michigan Athletic Director Dave
Brandon listened, hiring Whitten
to fill the void left by Sapp.
"I think that Dave Brandon felt
comfortable enough with what we
had built that he thought that I
would be a good candidate," Whit-
ten said. "I feel really, really fortu-
nate to have this opportunity and
now I just go to capitalize on it."
While Whitten is a young and
relatively inexperienced coach,
his track record at Michigan is all
Brandon needed to see to choose
Whitten as the right person to
become the ninth head coach in
Michigan's history.
While Michigan began improv-

ing the day Sapp was hired nine
years ago, the Wolverines' ascent
to the top of the rankings acceler-
ated with the hiring of Whitten.
He has helped build Michigan into
a dominant force.
With Whitten as an assistant,
the Wolverines have received a bid
to the NCAA Regional in the last
four seasons, even winning the
program's first team regional title
this past year. Michigan advanced
to the NCAA Championships and
finished in the top 10 twice in the
last three years.
Whitten also helped the Wol-
verines capture eight tournament
wins, while five of his players at
Michigan have earned eight med-
alist honors.
But perhaps nothing displays
how valuable Whitten has been
to the Wolverines more than his
appearance as a finalist over the

past two years for the Jan Strick-
land Award, which is presented to
the top assistant coach in all NCAA
divisions.
Modestly, Whitten points to
Sapp as one of the main reasons
he was such an effective assistant
coach, stating that he had such an
immense impact on player devel-
opment because of the free reign
he was given.
And his experience as an assis-
tant coach has given Whitten a
valuable familiarity with the stu-
dent-athletes on the squad, so he
will feel comfortable managing the
group and managing the program
on a day-to-day basis.
The Wolverines will also not
have to worry about adjusting to a
new coaching style. While Whitten
might make some minor adjust-
ments, he coaches very similarly to
Sapp.

"Coach Sapp and I are fairly
close in philosophy in how we
coach and how we recruit," Whit-
ten said. "There might be some
small tweaks on the recruiting trail
or with daily practices, but overall,
we've got a great groundwork and
foundation.
"It's more or less the same group
of players, minus the two seniors,
that are coming back. The team ha@
developed a nice personality and
we want to keep that intact"
It doesn't hurt either that the
Rockford, Mich. native has a
great understanding of golf and
the golf community in the state
of Michigan. Whitten hopes tha*
understanding will give him and
the Wolverines an added boost in
recruiting top-tier golfers.
"I can't wait to get the boys back
in the fall and get started as soon as
possible," Whitten said.

Jake Fox shares his thoughts on life in the MLB

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Writer
Perhaps one of the most self-
aware and reasonable personali-
ties in baseball, utilityman Jake
Fox, is in his ninth season in pro-
fessional baseball, now in the Bal-
timore Orioles organization.
He endured a turbulent period
at Michigan from 2000-02 and
left Ann Arbor for the professional
ranks after his junior year. He was
drafted by the Chicago Cubs as a
catcher in the third round of the
2003 MLB Draft. After fighting
through the minors for four years,
he finally broke into the majors
in 2007, but only for a handful of
games. He spent 2008 in AAA and
emerged back into the big leagues
in 2009.
Since then, the Beech Grove,
Ind. native was traded to Oakland
and then Baltimore. He has found
some success with the Orioles,
including a torrid spring training
this year in which he hit 10 home
runs. But for the time being, he
finds himself with their AAA affil-
iate in Norfolk, Va.
Fox, who has spent time at
catcher, third base and the out-
field, has hit .231 with 20 home
runs and 71 RBI in 185 games at the
major league level.
The Michigan Daily was able to
get him to share his experiences
in amateur and pro baseball a few
weeks ago when he was on the Ori-
oles roster.
The Michigan Daily: What are
your memories from your time at
Michigan and did it prepare you
for professional ball?
Jake Fox: Absolutely it did. My
time at Michigan was tough. I was
there through a transition period
when we went from Jeff Zahn to
Rich Maloney. My freshman year,
Jeff Zahn was our coach and then
Chris Harrison was our coach my
second year and then Rich Malo-
ney was my coach my third year.
So we never really had a consis-
tent coaching staff and it was dif-
ficult. But I think that prepared
me more for what I deal with than
anything I went through there.
The whole way through profes-
sional baseball - minor leagues
up to the major leagues and now
this is my third team in the major
leagues - you never know who's
going to be making up the lineup
cards, never know who's going to
put your name in the lineup. And

it really doesn't matter. You learn
that no matter who does it, no mat-
ter where they put you, where they
play you, you still go out and play
regardless of who's running the
show and who's making the deci-
sions. At Michigan, it just taught
you to go out there and play your
game.
You like to think when you com-
mit to go there that you'll be play-
ing for the same guy and that the
guys that brought you in will be
there for the whole three or four
years you're there. But that wasn't
necessarily the case. I think that
was an extremely great learn-
ing experience for me, especially
going into pro ball.
TMD: You left for the pros after
your junior year. Was that a diffi-
cult decision?
JF: I took a lot of heat from
people that were close to Michi-
gan because they wanted to see
me come back my senior year and
finish my degree and that sort of
thing. I ultimately did go back
to finish my degree, which I still
think of as my biggest accomplish-
ment so far that I've had. Getting
an opportunity after my junior
year was almost a dream come true
for me. I was ready to get started. I
felt like I was ready in my career,
I felt like I was ready physically
and mentally. And looking back, I
think it was a great decision for me
because I wouldn't be where I'm at
today had I not got that first year
under my belt and got ready to go.
TMD: How hard was the transi-
tion into professional baseball?
JF: I like to compare good col-
lege baseball to about a AA level.
When I played in the Cape Cod
League, you see a lot of the same
talent that you do in High A and
AA ball. obviously there's a little
bit of a difference with the balls
you use, the bats you use, but it's
still the same game. All you've got
to get used to isthe talent. You take
the best guys in college baseball
and those guys make it to the next
level. Then you take the best guys
from A ball level and they make
the AA level. And I think it's just
getting used to that pace of game
and that skill of play. That's the
hardest adjustment. You always
learn the game on the way up.
Through little league, high school,
college, you always learn the phys-
ical aspect of the game. But once
you get to pro ball, everyone can
do it physically and now you have

to learn the mental aspect of the
game and I think that's the biggest
part of development once you get
to professional baseball.
TMD: What have been some of
your biggest challenges in profes-
sional baseball and specifically the
major leagues?
JF: When people ask me what it
takes to get to the big leagues, my
No. 1 answer is perseverance. Yes,
persistence. Because it's a tough
road. There are some guys that get
a red carpet rolled out in front of
them and the big-time prospects
get a lot of money thrown at them
and in reality, most guys are not
that way. For most guys, it's an
uphill battle. You've got to fight
your way through the system,
you've got to weed yourself out and
for most of us it's a tough road to
get to the big leagues. Some guys
just get pushed through the minor
leagues and I was never that way.
Frank Robinson talked to us in
spring training and he told us that,
"When I got to the big leagues, I
always thought it was 70 percent
talent and 30 percent character
and the more I was around the
game, the more I realized I had
it backward. It's 70 percent char-
acter and 30 percent talent." And
I believe that. He says, "The guys
who don't have the right intan-
gibles don't usually make it to the
top. It's usually the guys who, No.
1, have the confidence to make it,
No. 2, are realistic with them-
selves and know what they have to
improve on, and No. 3, are able to
do that."And I think that combina-
tion is really what got me through
the minor leagues.
TMD: What's something that
you can't understand about the
majors until you've been there?
JF: It's funny you ask that. All
the way up, you always put the
major leagues as something on a
pedestal, almost as like a fairytale
destination. So once you get here,
you realize that everybody here
are just normal human beings like
everybody else. And it's funny
because you get here, and you
expect it to be some fairytale land
but it's really no different than all
the other levels you've played at.
It's just a new place with new faces.
Yeah, the talent gets better and it's
just like it does everywhere else.
Once you realize that all the guys
in the locker room went through
the same path that you did, that
everyone is in the same boat, you

Three student-athletes give back in Ecuador

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Two months after his season
ended in overtime of the NCAA
national championship game in St.
. Paul, Minn., Shawn Hunwick was
back in net.
But this time the senior goal-
tender for the Michigan hockey
team wasn't on skates, on ice or
even playing hockey. Hunwick was
between the pipes of a rusty soccer
goal, facing an onrushing group
of schoolchildren in Ecuador -
where soccer is king.
Michigan student-athletes
Hunwick, Meagan Cobb (water
polo) and Holly Hein (women's
soccer) partnered with Student-
Athletes Leading Social Change
to take a 10-day trip to build one of
the schools the organization fund-
ed in Chismaute, Ecuador.
The trio joined a cast of 15 other
students from Illinois, Lehigh,
North Carolina, Central Michigan
and Iowa State.
Michigan aligned with SALSC
as one of three charities that split
the proceeds from the annual
Mock Rock fundraiser in Febru-
ary.
Combined with the other
SALSC chapters on the trip, the
group raised $70,000 to construct
a school for the children of Chis-
maute. Mock Rock and Michigan
alone raised $18,000 in support of
SALSC.
But the money didn't lay the
groundwork for the school - the
student-athletes did.
"It's pretty amazing, because if
you get a bunch of student-athletes
down working on something ...
we're all competitive so they had
to force us to take breaks," Hun-

wick said. "We didn't want to stop
working."
The group dug trenches for the
foundation for the school, filled
it with rocks, made cement and
bricks, and completed the founda-
tion of one of the schools SALSC
funded. The money raised for the
trip helped to build the school,
help with water, and donate to a
girls' club and safe sports facility
in the village.
"It was great to get our hands
dirty and really work like the
members of the Chismaute com-
munity," Cobb said. "We were side-
by-side with them doing heavy
lifting with rocks and wheelbar-
rows and shovels.
"All community service is grati-
fying, but this was special."
For the student-athletes - a
group that Desmond Howard
recently blasted for having"a sense
of entitlement" - the trip wasn't a
vacation in five-star hotels, it was
marked with plenty of sacrifice.
"It's a completely different life-
style," Hunwick said. "We were in
the Andes Mountains down in the
Chimbaroza province, I think they
said families were living off $2.50
American per day. But these peo-
ple were genuinely happy every
day we met them - the kids were
ecstatic to see us.
"There's no right of entitlement
down there, they were, just genu-
inely happy to interact with us and
play with us. It's a testament to
how people can live an alternate
life from what we're used to and
still be very content. These people
in South America, they don't know
that we're on our cell phones and
doing all this stuff up here, and
they're happy with the life they
have."

It wasn't all work. The students
spent two days in Quito, the capi-
tol of Ecuador, to jumpstart the
trip and took a visit to the nearby
equator.
And then there wasftitbol.
Children throughout the village
of Chismaute visited the building
project and brought along their
trusty soccer balls to give the stu-
dent-athletes a break from laying
the foundation of the school. The
natives of the small village spoke a
mixture of Spanish and Quechua, a
dialect cluster spoken primarily in
the Andes region.
"A couple people on my team
were in our group and then there
were a bunch of little (Ecuadorian)
boys," Hein said. "We were play-
ing and the little boys would pass
us the ball and then yell, 'gringo' or
'gringa,' because they wanted the
ball back."
Hein was at home on the dusty
pitch at base of Mount Chimbaro-
za, Ecuador's highest volcano.
But somebody felt left out.
"Hockey never really came
up," Hunwick said with a laugh.
"I think the closest we came was
when I was playing goalie in soc-
cer. They know soccer and they
know volleyball, but hockey's not
really the hotbed.
"Everyone brought down differ-
ent kinds of balls, but I figured they
wouldn't have any use for a hockey
puck."
Cobb, who leads Michigan's
SALSC chapter alongside Haley
Kopmeyer, the goaltender of the
women's soccer team, said the
group expects to send more will-
ing students across the globe next
summer.
"As student-athletes, and as stu-
dents at Michigan in general, we

are so blessed to have everything
that we have - to turn on the sink
and have running water, to be able
to afford education. In these com-
munities, kids have to walk to
school, have to pay for school, and
some of them can't afford to go."
Added Hein: "To be able to put
the foundation down for a school
that's going to last so many years,
it affects not only the kids we were
playing with, but their kids and
maybe even their kids' kids."

And the project certainly paint-
ed a fresh coat onto the image of
college athletes, which has looked
rather weather-beaten lately.
"It's great for student-athletes to
give back, because we're very for-
tunate, and for us three it was an
honor to represent the University
of Michigan in South America,"
Hunwick said.
"We're spreading the Michi-
gan name and giving back in the
world."
