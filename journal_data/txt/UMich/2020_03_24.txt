As diagnosed cases of the novel 

coronavirus 
continue 
to 
climb 

across the country and throughout 

the state, the University of Michigan 

has limited all laboratory research 

deemed “noncritical” until further 

notice. The University and Michigan 

Medicine 
are 
also 
requesting 

that labs with available supplies, 

including face masks and gowns, 

donate their materials to the hospital 

as soon as possible to prepare for an 

influx of cases in the coming weeks. 

On 
Wednesday, 
Rebecca 

Cunningham, interim vice president 

for research and Susan M. Collins, 

acting provost and executive vice 

president 
for 
academic 
affairs, 

sent out a notice informing the 

University’s research community 

that all labs should “ramp down” 

their 
research 
activities. 
This 

change went into effect Friday at 5 

p.m. 

Cunningham 
and 
Collins 

acknowledged 
the 
negative 

repercussions of limiting research 

projects but said the change was 

made to protect the health of 

researchers and students. 

“Our 
research 
mission 
is 

important, however the health of our 

researchers and local community is 

more important,” Cunningham and 

Collins wrote. “Please note that we 

are working closely with leadership 

across the schools and colleges to 

minimize the impact this poses to 

your professional advancement, the 

advancement of your colleagues 

and to your ability to return to fully 

functional labs.” 

The order to drastically decrease 

nonessential 
research 
activity 

came after the University placed 

restrictions on all projects using 

human subjects on March 14. This 

restriction is set to continue until 

May 1, when the University will 

reevaluate whether research using 

human subjects is safe to proceed. 

On 
Monday, 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer signed the “Stay Home, 

Stay Safe” Executive Order requiring 

all “non-essential” businesses to 

temporarily cease operations and 

asking all Michigan residents to stay 

home unless absolutely necessary. 

In response, University President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
the 

University would move all summer 

and spring term classes online and 

make an effort to limit the number 

of people on campus. However, 

Schlissel 
said 
Whitmer’s 
order 

would not directly affect University 

research.

‘U’ shifts 
upcoming 
terms online

3 parties run for upcoming CSG election

The Daily assembled a guide detailing each group’s platform, key ideas, candidates

The University of Michigan’s 

Central Student Government will 

hold elections March 25-26 online. 

CSG handles tens of thousands 

of dollars to provide student 

services, conduct advocacy work 

on behalf of students, fund student 

organizations 
and 
represent 

the student voice to University 

administration. With three parties 

running for the executive ticket 

and dozens of issues affecting 

students, it can be difficult to 

choose who to vote for this week. 

Based on analyses of each 

party’s platforms and interviews 

with the executive tickets, The 

Daily has created this guide to 

help you navigate this election. 

You can read The Daily’s profiles 

of each party here: Mobilize, 

Change at Michigan and Represent 

Michigan. You can view your 

sample ballot — and vote when 

the time comes — online at vote.

THE ISSUES

Based on the issues impacting 

campus 
and 
analyses 
of 
the 

party platforms, The Daily has 

summarized each party’s policies 

for six categories that impact 

students. The entire platforms for 

Mobilize, Change at Michigan, 

and Represent Michigan can be 

found by clicking on their party 

names.

Affordability 
and 

Accessibility

CSG 
has 
previously 
been 

criticized for its work around 

campus affordability, most notably 

when a campus affordability guide 

created by the organization in 

2018 was called “out of touch” 

and prompted the creation of the 

student-sourced Being Not-Rich 

At U-M guide.

 While the University community 

has frequently had conversations 

relating 
to 
affordability 
and 

accessibility issues, data shows 

the socioeconomic makeup of the 

University has more students from 

the top 1 percent financially than 

the bottom 40 percent.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The University of Michigan faculty 

were not informed of the March 17 

email sent to University on-campus 

residents titled “URGENT: Petition 

to Remain in Housing,” according 

to an email LSA Dean Anne Curzan 

and Timothy McKay, associate dean 

for undergraduate education of LSA, 

sent to LSA faculty Tuesday night 

obtained by The Daily.

“We only learned of this message 

after it was forwarded to us,” 

Curzan and McKay wrote. “We 

cannot imagine what a distressing 

and disruptive message this was to 

receive for students still living in the 

dorms. We have been advocating for 

the students during the afternoon 

and are doing what we can to 

help in the wake of this sudden 

announcement.”

The email to on-campus residents 

directed students to return home, 

citing new developments in the 

COVID-19 
pandemic. 
It 
said 

students needed to have a request 

approved to remain in University 

Housing and that students should 

expect dining and residence halls to 

consolidate. The “request to remain 

in housing” form, which asked 

students to explain why they must 

remain on-campus, was due less 

than twenty-four hours later. 

“This information is needed by 

8am on Wednesday, March 18th,” 

University Housing wrote. “If you 

do not respond we will assume 

you have left campus and will 

discontinue building access.”

Kambiz Khalili, associate vice 

president of student life, followed 

up with an email to on-campus 

residents the next day to address 

and clarify messaging from the 

initial March 17 email.

“I am writing first to apologize for 

the anxiety, concerns and confusion 

created by the message you received 

yesterday regarding Housing move-

out 
and 
consolidation,” 
Khalili 

wrote. “I also wish to clarify that 

you were not required to have moved 

out by 8:00 am this morning.”

Physics professor Yuri Popov 

told The Daily that on Tuesday 

night he started receiving emails 

from students requesting alternate 

exam times for the Physics 140 

midterm scheduled for Thursday 

because they would be moving out 

of residence halls that day. When 

Popov asked the students why they 

couldn’t move out a different day, 

he was forwarded the University 

Housing email. 

Popov said he immediately wrote 

an email to Physics Departments 

Chair David Gerdes and McKay 

expressing his frustrations with 

the 
lack 
of 
communication 
to 

faculty regarding student housing 

situations.

“Why is no one communicating to 

us about this?” Popov wrote in his 

email to the department. “Why … are 

we the last to know that thousands 

of our students are in a state of crisis 

the day before they are supposed 

to take our exams, which were 

canceled last week in a similarly 

chaotic and poorly organized way? 

We need our leadership now. We 

need communication and guidance. 

AWOL is unacceptable and outright 

harmful in this situation. We don’t 

need motivational messages. We 

need someone to lead and inform us 

on logistics and actions.”

Popov stressed the need for a 

more holistic approach to student 

well-being that allows professors to 

take into account both academic and 

personal needs. 

“It shouldn’t be that attitude that, 

‘You guys just keep on teaching, 

and we’ll take care of students,’” 

Popov said. “That’s the completely 

wrong attitude because we need 

to know what’s going on with the 

students. … Look (at) how it looked 

from the student’s perspective. If 

instructors are kept in the dark, 

what happens here is from the 

student’s perspective they’ve been 

kicked out of the dorms and at the 

same time the physics professor 

sends them an email that says ‘hey 

guys, I’ll see you tomorrow at 9am in 

my online class.’”

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald noted that Housing has 

apologized for Tuesday’s message, 

and wrote that the University is 

focused on the important work 

moving forward.

“Messaging since that time has 

been well coordinated across the 

campus 
community,” 
Fitzgerald 

wrote. “That’s the most important 

factor.”

Nick Seewald, Rackham student 

and graduate student instructor, 

made adjustments to due dates for 

his Statistics 250 sections after he 

received the email from Curzan and 

McKay. 

“My responsibility as a GSI is to 

make sure students can learn and 

learn well, and oftentimes that is 

hindered by people having to take 

care of basic needs and worrying 

about things like ‘where am I going 

to live tomorrow?’” Seewald said. 

Seewald 
said 
better 

communication, or “at least a heads 

up,” that some students might be 

leaving campus abruptly would have 

made it easier to facilitate classes.

“It would have made the situation 

seem like it was more unified, like 

there was at least some conversation 

about this across different areas of 

the University,” Seewald said. “As 

it was, I sort of found out at 10 p.m. 

and realized that that was less than 

12 hours before the stated deadline 

for students to apply to stay in the 

dorms. It made things difficult to 

respond appropriately without a lot 

of lean time.”

Seewald noted that the COVID-19 

pandemic created an unprecedented 

situation for the University and 

didn’t ascribe any ill intent to the 

lack of communication. 

“Everybody’s 
under 
a 
lot 
of 

pressure right now, and there’s a 

lot of pressure to act fast,” Seewald 

said. “So, I can empathize with the 

decision to act fast, but it definitely 

caused a scramble.”

Schlissel said all schools and 

colleges at the University should 

work to ensure that students 

are able to meet graduation 

requirements despite classes 

being 
moved 
to 
an 
online 

format. 
He 
noted 
certain 

programs cannot be delivered 

adequately online and may have 

to be canceled for the spring and 

summer terms. 

“This decision aligns with 

our ongoing efforts to respond 

to the pandemic, by maintaining 

this critical part of our mission 

while 
encouraging 
social 

distancing,” Schlissel wrote. “In 

conjunction with our provost’s 

offices, I ask schools and 

colleges to prioritize offering 

programs and coursework that 

allows current students to keep 

working toward their degrees 

and not fall behind.”

Schlissel said the University 

will 
continue 
to 
provide 

services like dining hall take-

out meals to those who remain 

on-campus 
or 
in 
residence 

halls. 

The decision to cancel spring 

and summer term classes comes 

after the University ordered all 

research laboratories to “ramp 

down” research projects that 

are not related to COVID-19. 

With the “Stay Home, Stay 

Safe” 
order, 
all 
University 

employees 
are 
required 
to 

work from home unless their 

on-campus work is considered 

essential to the University’s 

mission to slow the spread of 

the virus. 

At 
a 
press 
conference 

Monday, Whitmer said the 

order was enacted to promote 

responsible social distancing as 

confirmed cases of COVID-19 

continue to grow. The executive 

order, which asks that Michigan 

residents not leave their homes 

unless absolutely necessary, is 

planned to remain in place for 

at least three weeks. 

“Please know that even with 

today’s action, the number 

of cases will go up yet today, 

tomorrow and the days ahead. 

It will take some time for 

us to impact this,” Whitmer 

said. “We will be continually 

evaluating the science, the data, 

the impact on your health. It is 

going to take greater testing. 

We made strides, but we must 

do more so we can understand 

the challenges that we are 

confronting. So we can draw 

based on data.”

Currently, there are over 

1,000 
diagnosed 
cases 
of 

COVID-19 in Michigan and 15 

confirmed deaths. On Sunday, 

the first death in Washtenaw 

County 
was 
recorded 
at 

Michigan Medicine.

Symptoms of the coronavirus 

include 
fever, 
cough 
and 

shortness of breath. People who 

believe they have been exposed 

to coronavirus should call their 

health care providers or the 

nearest hospital. Individuals 

can also contact their local 

health department, which in 

Washtenaw County can be 

reached at 734-544-6700.

“The order will not significantly 

alter 
the 
university’s 
research 

operations, as we moved last Friday to 

ramp down all noncritical laboratory 

research activities,” Schlissel wrote. 

LSA 
junior 
Chayton 
Fivecoat 

works in a neurobiology lab and is 

planning on pursuing an honors 

thesis in Molecular, Cellular and 

Developmental 
Biology. 
Fivecoat, 

who works with mice in what he 

described as a “hands-on” lab, said 

his work for this year is completed 

because his research cannot be done 

remotely. 

“Before classes kind of went to the 

wayside, I was in there about 10 hours 

a week,” Fivecoat said. “(Now) for me, 

it was completely shut down. I know 

a lot of my other friends, they can do 

some stuff remotely, but a lot of my 

stuff was ... doing benchwork. So my 

portion of the lab, I can’t do anything. 

I’m almost powerless to do anything.”

Much of Fivecoat’s work was 

done in preparation for his honors 

thesis, which most students begin 

in junior year and finish a month 

before their graduation date. Fivecoat 

said he is still planning on being able 

to complete his thesis on time but 

worries the shutdown of research 

may slow the process down. 

“I think it will slow down my 

ability to write a thesis just because a 

lot of the data collection was going to 

be happening this semester,” Fivecoat 

said. “But in terms of my projection as 

a(n) (MCDB) major and as a student, 

I think I’d be still pretty much on 

track.”

LSA 
freshman 
Saad 
Shami 

also worked in a lab as part of 

the 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity Program this year. 

Shami worked with Qiong Yang, 

assistant professor of biophysics, on 

a project relating to the cell cycle 

and the mechanisms behind it in an 

effort to create a biosensor. Shami 

said because he worked in a wet 

lab, meaning he handled different 

chemicals or substances, he cannot do 

any work remotely.

“Not being able to work in a lab 

until next semester in sophomore 

year, it’s not the greatest and I feel like 

I’m not getting the full experience of 

UROP,” Shami said. “Shutting down a 

lot of research projects, it’s definitely 

the right thing, especially if they 

want to enforce social distancing. 

But for the projects themselves, it 

impacts them because we were still 

in the early stages of our project. We 

were trying to spend as much time 

as possible in the lab, trying to figure 

out what protein was best to make the 

biosensor. So it limits us.”

Shami said after classes moved 

online, the whole lab received an email 

from Yang asking if supplies could be 

donated to Michigan Medicine to help 

protect healthcare workers treating 

COVID-19 patients. On March 18, Teri 

Grieb, senior director for research 

at the Medical School, sent an email 

to all research faculty asking labs to 

donate unopened supplies including 

N95 masks, face shields and hand 

alcohol. 

On Friday, March 20, Michigan 

Medicine published a press release 

asking 
the 
greater 
community 

to 
donate 
protective 
gear 
and 

announcing the creation of a drop-off 

donation site at the North Campus 

Research Complex. Janet Abbruzzese, 

director of supply chain management 

for Michigan Medicine, expressed 

her gratitude for the community’s 

support in the press release. 

“It’s truly incredible what we 

have heard from local residents and 

businesses, and people all over the 

state, in recent days. We’ve received 

offers of supplies that they know 

are needed to care for COVID-19 

patients, and our team has ramped 

up quickly to be able to accept them,” 

Abbruzzese said. “We have already 

had an amazing outpouring of 

supplies from scientific laboratories 

across the university, and now we are 

turning to the broader community.” 

In an email to the Daily, Kara Gavin, 

spokesperson for Michigan Medicine, 

said the hospital has already received 

donations since opening on Saturday.

“In just the first day, less than 24 

hours after we announced the drive, 

we had 224 cars, plus two people on 

bikes and 5 walkers,” Gavin wrote.

First-year 
Law 
student 

Jessica 
Paduganan 
created 

a petition titled, “Petition 

for 
Clarification 
and 

Representation 
Regarding 

Plans 
for 
the 
Lawyers 

Club” Tuesday, because she 

was anxious and confused 

about the effect Tuesday’s 

University Housing email had 

on the Lawyers Club Graduate 

Residence. The petition had 

over 50 law student signatures 

as of Tuesday afternoon when 

Paduganan sent it to the Law 

School administration.

“We have asked the Lawyers 

Club administration to clarify 

the email, but to our surprise 

and dismay, they were also 

unaware of this email or 

what it could possibly mean 

for us,” Paduganan wrote. 

“We understand that these 

decisions are being made at 

another level, but the lack of 

clarifying information, which 

should be sent after these 

central 
University 
emails, 

leads us to think that there 

is no one from Law School 

Housing who is participating 

in, and advocating for us in 

these meetings.”

Paduganan said Tuesday’s 

University Housing email put 

graduate students in a hard 

position because many haven’t 

lived with their parents for 

years and don’t have a place to 

return to. 

“There’s a whole variety 

of reasons why ‘going home’ 

is not an option for people,” 

Paduganan said. “I don’t think 

that the University understood 

that saying ‘go home’ felt like 

we were being pushed out, 

that we were not welcome 

here and that the University of 

Michigan was not home to us.”

Paduganan 
has 
since 

spoken 
with 
the 
Lawyers 

Club administration, and she 

appreciated 
Wednesday’s 

follow-up email and University 

Housing’s $1,200 refund to 

all students who move out of 

residence halls and University 

apartments by March 25.

“I think some of the steps 

the University is taking is 

moving in the right direction, 

like starting to offer some 

refunds, 
clarifying 
the 

situation, apologizing for the 

tone and some of the anxiety 

they’ve caused,” Paduganan 

said. 

LSA 
freshman 
Lindsey 

Haughton, 
an 
out-of-state 

student, initially planned on 

staying 
in 
Mosher-Jordan 

Residence Hall long-term after 

the move to online classes. She 

said Tuesday’s housing email 

quickly changed those plans, 

and 
an 
exam 
Wednesday 

morning and a paper due 

Wednesday night added to her 

stress. 

“It 
was 
just 
really 

overwhelming 
and 
chaotic, 

especially because the days 

that they had given us off were 

last week when it seemed like 

people could stick around,” 

Haughton said. “And so, to 

have all those assignments 

looming 
during 
this 
time 

when we did actually have to 

move out of the dorms was 

really stressful.”

Haughton appreciated the 

effort by her professors to 

accommodate her move back 

home to New York Wednesday. 

“I reached out to my English 

teacher, for example, and had 

a paper deadline moved for 

that day. But teachers seemed 

to be primarily unaware that 

this was going on, which I 

think added to the stress,” 

Haughton said. “I was lucky 

that I had a relationship with 

mine and she trusted that this 

chaos was going on.”

M 

obilize’s presidential 

candidate 

Amanda 
Kaplan, 

a Public Policy junior, and 

vice presidential candidate 

Saveri Nandigama, an LSA 

junior, have a long list of 

achievements on CSG and 

held nearly every leadership 

position in the organization, 

apart from the presidency. 

Kaplan 
is 
currently 
chief 

of staff in Ben Gerstein’s 

administration 
and 
has 

previously served as vice-

chair 
of 
CSG’s 
Finance 

Committee, as a member of 

the 
Student 
Organization 

Funding Committee, and as 

an LSA representative in the 

CSG Assembly. Nandigama 

was 
previously 
chief 
of 

staff 
in 
Daniel 
Greene’s 

administration 
and 
noted 

herself as the youngest person 

to have ever held that position. 

These 
credentials 
give 

Mobilize’s team clear insider 

knowledge on how to manage 

their 
student 
government 

roles and enact change within 

the community.

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board was drawn to Mobilize 

because of clear, achievable 

platform goals. Beyond simple 

buzzwords like sustainability 

and 
affordability, 
Mobilize 

is 
impassioned 
by 
issues 

pertaining to climate change 

and 
divestment, 
student 

wellness and sexual assault 

survivor support. In terms 

of 
environmental 
policy, 

Kaplan 
and 
Nandigama’s 

commitment 
to 
increase 

transparency 
regarding 
the 

President’s 
Commission 
on 

Carbon Neutrality and call 

on the University to commit 

to carbon neutrality by 2030 

aligns 
with 
the 
Editorial 

Board’s 
own 
aspirations 

for our administration. For 

election season, their support 

for the Voter Affairs and 

Engagement Commission will 

provide on campus signage for 

and transportation to student 

voting locations as well as 

advocate for the cancellation 

of classes on election day to 

allow students to get out to 

the polls. Finally, regarding 

the 
University’s 
resources, 

Mobilize supports the One 

University 
(1U) 
campaign 

that works to grant equitable 

funding for all three campuses. 

Moreover, we believe Kaplan 

and 
Nandigama’s 
close 

partnership 
and 
existing 

friendship 
is 
uniquely 

conducive to achieving this 

goals.

Mobilize seems to have a 

firm grasp of CSG’s role on 

campus, and understands how 

they can utilize its powers and 

its relationships with other 

student 
organizations 
to 

improve life for students at the 

University of Michigan. First, 

their aforementioned concern 

about the impact of the 2020 

presidential debate on student 

life and their plan to work 

with the Campus Climate 

Advisory Council to develop 

a response system for the 

election season demonstrates 

their understanding of what 

CSG could accomplish and 

how it could constructively 

improve campus life. This, 

coupled with their advocacy 

for M-Card only accessible 

spaces during the debates, 

displays how Mobilize plans 

to put the well-being and 

safety of University students 

first 
during 
a 
potentially 

stressful yet exciting time of 

student life.

Additionally, 
Mobilize’s 

platform was not self-created; 

instead, 
it 
was 
developed 

through 
consultation 
with 

student organizations around 

campus. Because of this, we 

believe 
Mobilize’s 
platform 

does 
not 
simply 
include 

positions which the candidates 

themselves believe are best for 

Michigan, but rather changes 

which 
students 
and 
their 

groups want to see. Because of 

this, Mobilize is prepared and 

well-suited to fight for changes 

that are meaningful and would 

serve to make campus better 

for everyone.

The 
other 
two 
parties 
running 

in the March 25 elections, 

Change 
at 
Michigan 
and 

Represent Michigan, also have 

thoughtful, 
comprehensive 

platforms 
and 
impressive 

experience enacting change 

on campus, both in and out of 

CSG. We have no doubt that all 

of these parties would do an 

impressive job of representing 

student voices at the University 

of Michigan. However, our 

decision to endorse Mobilize 

was ultimately decided by the 

presence of clear, attainable 

goals within their platform, 

their 
extensive 
experience 

within CSG that is currently 

unmatched by other candidates 

and the close dynamic between 

the two running mates. 

Turnout 
in 
previous 

elections for CSG by students 

has 
been 
relatively 
low 

compared to total enrollment. 

Taking the time to vote on 

candidates and peers who are 

trying to implement tangible 

policy change for students is 

an important responsibility of 

our student body. Above all, 

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board 
encourages 
every 

University student to exercise 

their voice and participate in 

the CSG elections this week. 

O

n Wednesday, March 11, 

the University of Michigan 

canceled 
classes 
for 
the 

remainder of the week and decided 

to move to an online format for the 

rest of the semester in light of the 

coronavirus pandemic. I was sitting 

at the Michigan Union, rushing to 

meet a deadline, when I received 

the email. The atmosphere around 

me immediately shifted. Textbooks 

closed, phones rang and chaos was 

in the air. Students’ first response 

was excitement for the four-day 

weekend, but the commotion quickly 

turned into grief and panic as they 

began understanding the grander 

implications 
of 
the 
situation. 
It 

meant figuring out how to get home 

at a moment’s notice and risking the 

dangers of air travel. It meant saying 

an early goodbye to a new chapter of 

life and to best friends that had turned 

to family. It meant that (although this 

announcement came later) after four 

years of an intense grind, college 

seniors would not get to walk at 

graduation. And for the class of 2023, 

it meant never getting to complete 

their freshman year of college.

Only seven short months ago, 

the class of 2023 was packing up 

their vans and heading to campus. 

It was the beginning of dorm life, 

unimaginable 
experiences 
and 
a 

great deal of trial and error. In the 

seventh month of freshman year, 

the blue, moving day bins roamed 

the residence halls once again. The 

semester was cut short by something 

everyone would always remember. 

As cliche as it sounds, freshman 

year is the year of finding oneself 

both individually and professionally. 

It’s the year for meeting a version of 

yourself you didn’t know existed and 

for figuring out how to be a student at 

the second-best public university in 

the country. The nightly study push 

to the Shapiro Undergraduate Library 

and questionable dining hall meals 

were just starting to feel like routine, 

and Ann Arbor was just starting to 

feel like home. Now, students trade 

in their dorm lounge study sessions 

for long hours on FaceTime with 

friends halfway across the country 

in an attempt to feel normal again. 

But it’s just not the same. For many 

students, being home has its own set 

of struggles.

Due to the nationally rising number 

of coronavirus cases, many states 

have mandated curfews alongside 

the closing of public spaces like bars, 

restaurants and libraries, leaving 

students in complete isolation. This, 

in addition to recommended social 

distancing practices, especially does 

not bode well for the percentage of 

northeastern college students that 

are just beginning to recover from the 

notorious “winter blues.” The five-

and-a-half-month period back home 

inevitably offsets all the self-growth 

and newfound sense of independence 

that emerges from the unfamiliarity 

of one’s first semester at college. 

For many, home means cramped 

hometowns, toxic households and 

all-consuming struggles that were 

escaped after high school graduation. 

For some, home is conducive to steps 

backward instead of forward: It breeds 

complacency over discomfort because 

that’s the easy thing to do. Remotely, 

it’s easy to feel content doing the 

bare minimum at a university that 

is otherwise constantly doing the 

most and expecting the most out 

of its students. In the new era of 

online classes, it is likely we will not 

fully reap the benefits of our tuition 

dollars. We will be expected to finish 

winter semester doing college without 

the college experience — without our 

community of the Leaders and the 

Best.

And that sense of community 

doesn’t come easily for many first-

semester freshmen, as much as we 

hate to admit it. It was a lot of feeling 

out of place, not getting what you 

wanted and constantly questioning 

your interests. The looming sense of 

imposter syndrome many incoming 

students face was more manageable 

come 
second 
semester: 
There 

were more friends to turn to and a 

community seemed imaginable. Then, 

sophomore year was going to be the 

year — the year of diving headfirst 

into career opportunities, continuing 

to meet some of the most important 

people in your life and becoming the 

best version of yourself. Instead, next 

fall seems doomed with even more 

confusion and a lesser sense of self. 

As University students, we face 

an 
extremely 
privileged 
problem 

amid a global pandemic. But it’s OK 

to feel disheartened, to feel robbed 

of critical months of growth and to 

feel discomfort in knowing there 

are far worse consequences of this 

crisis beyond our control. In fact, this 

serves as even more reason to come 

back in the fall determined and ready 

for anything. Because freshman year 

is never really over. Anytime can be 

a fresh start for new beginnings and 

experiences. And that starts with this 

five-and-a-half-month hiatus from 

college life. Hold on to those first 

seven months of pulling all-nighters 

during exam season, dancing along 

to “Mr. Brightside” at frat parties and 

eating meals at ungodly hours. Come 

back next semester to continue the 

freshman experience right where you 

left it.

Vote Mobilize

I 

n anticipation of voting in Central Student Government elections, 
which begins on March 25, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board 
is proud to endorse the party Mobilize. After interviews with 

representatives from all three CSG parties and careful review of their 
platforms, we found Mobilize to be the most promising based on their 
extensive CSG experience and clear commitment to sustainability, 
campus affordability and student wellness, especially in the context of 
the upcoming U.S. presidential debate to be held on campus in Fall 2020.

W 

hen reflecting on 

my four years spent 

trying to navigate 

the University of Michigan as 

a South Asian woman, I recall 

only one professor who shared 

the same core social identities 

as me. It’s a harsh realization 

to enter a community or field 

of work where it is not common 

to find professors who look like 

me, talk like me or grew up like 

me. It’s the role of an academic 

institution 
— 
particularly 
a 

leading center for education, 

research and innovation — to 

create a faculty that is reflective 

of a diverse student body. It’s time 

to equally prioritize diversifying 

University 
staff 
and 
faculty 

positions, just as it is to create a 

diverse student population.

The ADVANCE Program at 

the University not only pursues 

highly effective initiatives to 

improve diversity but also tests 

whether the recommendations 

actually result in a more diverse 

faculty. For example, a recent 

study 
conducted 
by 
Denise 

Sekaquaptewa, Koji Takahashi 

and the ADVANCE program at 

the University and published 

in 
Equality, 
Diversity 
and 

Inclusion — an international 

journal — seeks to evaluate 

current 
departmental 
hiring 

practices 
and 
suggestions 

to hire for diversity. In the 

study 
“An 
evidence-based 

faculty recruitment workshop 

influences departmental hiring 

practice 
perceptions 
among 

university faculty,” the authors 

demonstrate 
the 
positive 

impacts 
of 
a 
workshop 
on 

attitudes toward diversifying 

hiring practices and reducing 

biases on both an individual and 

department-wide level. In doing 

so, Sekaquaptewa et al. highlight 

the importance of introducing 

systematic changes that require 

faculty search committees to 

practice 
mindfulness 
about 

social identities and emphasize 

how critical it is to challenge 

societal norms. 

The results show that even if a 

member of the recruiting process 

did not receive the formal 

workshop 
training 
intended 

to 
address 
social 
identities, 

disparities, gender, race and so on, 

if the majority of their colleagues 

within 
the 
department 
did 

attend the training, there was a 

positive impact on the decisions 

of the untrained individual. This 

reflects a behavioral shift across 

a department simply caused 

by opening up perspectives on 

partaking in more equitable 

hiring strategies. This isn’t just an 

example of successful program 

implementation; it clearly shows 

that the University is capable 

of setting a higher standard in 

which search committees make 

it their responsibility to reduce 

unconscious biases and adjust 

attitudes.

Additionally, constructing a 

faculty of diverse backgrounds is 

particularly beneficial to students 

because the content of the course 

is then further supported by a 

variety of experiences specific 

to the unique professor and their 

own path. Varied experiences 

are also helpful when there’s a 

need to make department-wide 

decisions. Life experiences pave 

the way for options that may not 

have been considered otherwise 

when making decisions about 

what fits best for a student 

population made up of many 

different identities. For example, 

it is inspiring for a female aiming 

to work in a male-dominated 

profession 
to 
see 
female 

professors making an impact in 

their own fields. From a student’s 

perspective, it’s reassuring to see 

a professor of similar identities at 

a prestigious institution like the 

University challenging societal 

norms and working on what 

they’re most passionate about. 

The University of Wisconsin-

Madison makes use of “Cluster 

Hiring,” 
or 
interdisciplinary 

strategic hiring. The goal is to 

create teams that collaboratively 

pull on individual strengths to 

contribute to a department’s 

overarching goal. A main reason 

for this new implementation is to 

serve the university’s objective 

in increasing campus diversity. 

This is an interesting concept 

that might serve well for the 

U-M community.

University departments must 

make ongoing assessments of 

where they stand on the spectrum 

of diversity in the workplace. 

“Diversity in the workplace” is 

a buzz phrase thrown around 

by Fortune 500 companies in an 

attempt to showcase that their 

mission statement is intolerant 

of 
discriminatory 
behavior; 

however, it is important to 

look around the room. When 

you’re at a meeting involving 

executive positions, such as the 

chair of a department, evaluate 

whether or not the department is 

incorporating as many identities 

as 
possible. 
This 
requires 

rethinking and restructuring of 

the hiring process in the short-

term. The long-term gains to the 

University as a whole make this 

endeavor worth it. 

VARNA KODOTH | COLUMN

L 

et’s go back to Jan. 31, when 

there were zero COVID-19 

cases in the United States, 

zero in Michigan and a similar 

situation in South Korea, where I 

and the majority of my friends are 

from. What I remember from those 

good old days, however, is that even 

at that moment, it was not as easy to 

get face masks as before. In addition 

to the concerns about where to buy 

them, we had an extra concern: 

whether we should wear them at 

all. The consensus from everyone I 

talked to was “I really need to wear 

a face mask, but at the same time, 

I’m concerned with nunchi,” or the 

Korean expression for gauging the 

moods of others. In this case, how 

folks here feel seeing people wearing 

face masks.

This collective concern is based on 

the cultural difference regarding face 

masks. In many East Asian cultures, 

face masks are not something you 

would wear only when you are ill. 

Long before the outbreak of COVID-

19, it has been a collective norm in 

those cultures to wear face masks as 

a preventative health measure, dating 

to the SARS outbreak and as far back 

as the 1950s. Not only to prevent the 

common cold or flu, face masks are 

worn to protect the respiratory system 

from yellow dust or smog, to stay warm 

or for beauty purposes. For those who 

regularly wear make-up, it’s a tool to 

cover their bare face. For those who 

don’t, it’s an option to cover pimples, 

skin trouble or a dissatisfactory lower 

half of face. For these reasons, it’s 

not hard to find people wearing face 

masks in streets or subways of major 

East Asian cities. During winter, flu 

seasons or whenever yellow dust and 

smog get serious, people wearing face 

masks outnumber people who are not. 

With this in mind, it was a surprise to 

find out when I first came to the U.S. 

that virtually no one wears face masks.

Without such cultural contexts, 

it is understandable that there is 

a stigma that face masks belong in 

hospitals. This explained why healthy 

people walking on the street in face 

masks often get that subtle glance. 

Until January, it was just a subtle 

glance. A week after, we realized 

we were not overly concerned: That 

subtle glance turned into violence. 

A stranger in New York beating an 

Asian woman wearing a face mask 

was not only a racist incident, but a 

violent contribution to the stigma 

associated with face masks. During 

the panic, a Korean man was stabbed 

in Montreal, and the fear became 

real for many. For me, face masks 

visualize racist hysteria. On March 

14, I was asked by a Lyft driver to 

explain why I was wearing a face 

mask. Those who misunderstand the 

wearing of face masks mostly don’t 

know that they are also meant for 

healthy people to protect themselves 

from other individuals. Simply not 

knowing the differing perceptions of 

face masks around the world is not 

an act of ignorance per se, but acting 

racist about the safety precaution is.

There remains controversy over 

whether face masks are the most 

effective measures to block COVID-

19, which spreads mainly through 

respiratory droplets. However, since 

the effect of face masks as COVID-19 

prevention still seems contested in the 

U.S., I would refrain from making the 

statement that everyone should wear 

them. Though I personally believe 

everyone should. Nevertheless, at 

least one clear thing is that we must 

destigmatize those who decide to 

wear face masks for their own safety or 

with the safety and wellness of others 

in mind.

I would like to conclude by sharing 

the other side of the story: the bright 

side. I thank the Kroger staff who 

showed me a wholehearted smile, the 

Walgreens cashier with a great sense 

of humor and another Uber driver 

who wished me to stay safe. I have 

observed tragic events around the 

world allowing racism to be condoned 

and justified under the name of a 

potential national security threat, but 

these people are the ones who upheld 

my trust in humanity.

The LSA Student Government 

released a statement that stated: 

“International student communities, 

as 
well 
as 
students 
of 
certain 

ethnicities, are affected the most by 

this unwelcoming environment. … At 

this time, we should unite together to 

face this public health concern rather 

than allowing preconceived notions 

to warrant targeting students of 

certain identities.” Indeed, flattening 

the curve is a collective mission 

and stigmatization does nothing 

but alienate and other minorities.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

For the past week or so, I have 

found myself coming back to the 

album You Won’t Get What You Want 

by Daughters. For one, it provides 

a cathartic chaos. It’s also just a 

phenomenal record. Most importantly, 

it manages to demonstrate the bleak 

reality of the human race through 

our current global situation. To 

understand this, however, we must 

understand the album in the context 

of its release.

When the news came out that 

Daughters was coming back to release 

an album in the fall of 2018, fans 

held their breath. It had been nearly 

a decade since their last release — a 

self-titled record which heightened 

and refined the brutal noise rock 

sound that they explored in the 

2000s. Daughters felt like a perfect 

yet bittersweet send-off to the band, 

which disbanded shortly before the 

release and only showed hints of 

reuniting in 2015. When the first 

single for the new album was released, 

it was clear something big was on the 

horizon. The song’s seven minute 

length posed a drastic change for the 

group (this was a band whose debut 

album was 11 minutes long). Needless 

to say, the hype was real. 

What did we get? Perhaps more 

than we anticipated. You Won’t Get 

What You Want will most definitely 

go down as one of the most terrifying 

albums of the decade. Just the cover 

art, a once-human face grotesquely 

melted into a monstrous form, creates 

a sense of dread. As it turns out, the 

cover is actually the least frightening 

aspect of the album.

For 
me, 
the 
terror 
starts 

immediately with the first track “City 

Song.” It begins with a low thunderous 

drone and the steady pulsing of the 

kick drum. Out of nowhere, a sharp 

snare pierces the soundscape. This 

continues for quite some time, building 

a horrible anticipation. For a moment, 

the sound fades out to nothing, only 

to come back in an explosion of sound 

and texture. This cycle repeats itself 

several times on the track, adding 

more textures each time until the song 

sounds like a siren warning impending 

doom. Meanwhile, frontman Alexis 

Marshall is spewing lyrics about a 

doomed city in absolute monotone.

You Won’t Get What You Want 

is 
absolutely 
unrelenting. 
After 

something as jarring and turbulent 

as “City Song,” a track that would 

probably be the climax of any other 

record, 
you’d 
expect 
something 

softer for contrast, or at least a pause 

between songs. With the next track 

“Long Road, No Turns,” there is 

no pause. This song is a maelstrom. 

Every inch is taken up by sound. It 

has a carnival-like quality to it, if said 

carnival was made up of malevolent 

power tools. You could imagine my 

shock when I found out they were only 

using guitars to achieve that sound.

Every song explores noise rock 

through 
different 
means, 
which 

allows each track to distinguish itself. 

The single “Satan in the Wait” has a 

chorus that embraces a sort of gothic 

organ sound that is almost medieval. 

“Less Sex” is the type of dark pop that 

I’d want to hear from Billie Eilish. The 

song “Daughter” finds a way to mix a 

bossa nova beat with harshly echoing 

guitars. “Ocean Song” is a marathon 

of a track that somehow makes a steel 

drum-esque texture sound terrifying. 

The closer “Guest House” sees the 

band combine frantic guitar parts 

with oppressive horns. The point is 

that Daughters does this seamlessly, 

and they maintain a certain level 

of melodicism to counteract the 

overwhelming harshness.

The reason I’m able to call You 

Won’t Get What You Want a perfect 

album, however, doesn’t have to 

do with the sound. Yes, the sound 

provides the foundation for the 

album, but the concept and lyricism 

are the icing on top. Alexis Marshall 

evokes the likes of Nick Cave, Tom 

Waits and even some Bob Dylan with 

his storytelling. The way the project 

wrestles with insanity, paranoia and 

tragedy feels deeply personal but also 

vague enough to apply to anyone. 

With this in mind, I think the album 

grapples with “the beast within,” 

or the idea that humanity has an 

inherent monstrous nature buried 

within us all, lying dormant. The track 

“Ocean Song” in particular captures 

this in detailing the story of a normal 

man who’s overcome by a primal 

urge to run. Perhaps what’s most 

terrifying about this song is that there 

is no inciting incident. This inhuman 

feeling just shows up.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been 

a sobering reminder of how tragic 

and brutal life can get. You Won’t Get 

What You Want could not be a better 

companion to this sentiment (it’s 

literally in the title). Lyrics like “This 

city is an empty glass / Shops are 

closed” and “Today’s gonna feel like 

tomorrow, some day / Tomorrow’s 

gonna feel like yesterday / This world 

is opening up” feel more relevant now 

than they did in 2018. The idea of “the 

beast within” is manifested in reality 

— coronavirus has brought with it 

extreme hoarding, a rise in domestic 

abuse and total uncertainty. You 

Won’t Get What You Want displays 

an internal apocalypse through the 

presentation of an external one, 

something I hadn’t realized until now.

“The Platform” has a thing or two 

to say about trickle-down theory. 

Setting his film in a near-future prison-

tower in which food is distributed to 

different levels by way of a descending 

stone slab, director Galder Gaztelu-

Urrutia (“The House On The Lake”) 

takes a steep plunge into madness and 

delivers a searing criticism of economic 

inequalities in class-based societies.

A number of elements came into 

alignment to allow the Spanish sci-

fi satire “The Platform” to deliver 

its message to the maximum effect. 

For one, many of us currently find 

ourselves confined to the oppressive 

walls of our homes, something that 

marries well with the cramped setting 

of “The Platform.” It also happens 

to follow the recent success of Oscar 

champion “Parasite,” which shares 

similar themes of class strife and made 

domestic audiences hungry for foreign 

films. And finally, it was snapped 

up by Netflix after its 2019 Toronto 

International Film Festival premiere 

(where it won the People’s Choice 

Award for Midnight Madness, an apt 

accolade indeed), allowing it to be 

streamed to millions.

With the world throttled by a 

pandemic, dystopian and apocalyptic 

stories of all types have become 

vested with an extra air of authority. 

“The Platform” isn’t about pestilence 

or social isolation, but with global 

circumstances exposing systemic flaws 

in our society left and right, its blunt 

indictment of the inequities wrought by 

class and capitalism — and its matching 

encouragement 
of 
solidarity 
and 

kindness — comes extremely apropos.

“The Platform” has something to say 

and cuts right to it, eschewing subtlety 

or finesse. The concept is simple, 

probably best put as a vertical version 

of 
Bong 
Joon-ho’s 
“Snowpiercer” 

(which is also on Netflix, by the way). 

In “Snowpiercer,” humanity is locked 

in a life-saving locomotive where 

caboose-dwellers live in squalor and 

engine-goers dine like monarchs. 

“The Platform” takes this and rotates 

it 90 degrees, setting its characters 

in a narrow prison hundreds of 

stories tall known as the Vertical 

Self-Management Center, or VSMC. 

Provided each person takes only their 

fair share, the eponymous platform 

bears a bounteous cornucopia of 

foodstuffs capable of feeding everyone. 

But the inhabitants of the VSMC 

have another name for the prison: 

the Hole. The Hole is much more 

accurate nomenclature — the place is a 

shithole, a hell-pit. While the top levels 

gorge themselves, the lower levels eat 

scraps … or otherwise feast on a very 

different sort of meal. When everyman 

Goreng 
(Ivan 
Massagué, 
“Pan’s 

Labyrinth”) wakes up alongside his 

cellmate Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor, 

“Txarriboda”), he quickly learns that a 

belief in decency and the copy of “Don 

Quixote” he brought as his one personal 

item won’t take him far.

I applied discretion in describing the 

cuisine of the Hole, but “The Platform” 

does not: this movie is not for the 

squeamish. Montages of lip-smacking 

and noisome finger-licking abound, 

interrupted by bouts of stomach-

churning cannibalism and disgustingly 

literal episodes of that “shithole” 

comment. The action is as graphic 

and to-the-point as its set design is 

brutalist: no frills, no flair, simple and 

nauseatingly efficient.

Like 
Chris 
Evans’ 
Curtis 
in 

“Snowpiercer,” Goreng soon decides 

that something needs to change, as 

protagonists often do. But while there’s 

plenty of flesh-eating, the popular “eat 

the rich” rallying cry holds little ground 

here. “The Platform” is not simply a 

criticism of the inequities inherent in 

a class-based, capitalist society; it takes 

aim at human nature itself, with all its 

greedy and gluttonous proclivities. As 

one prisoner notes, any solidarity is 

“solidarity covered in shit.” People from 

the bottom vying for their fair share are 

more than happy to wolfishly consume 

once they get to the top. While there 

is some amount of hope, the question 

looms of whether the system can be 

changed before it changes you.

The vision “The Platform” has of 

humanity is an ugly one. But it’s this 

unflinching gaze (something I certainly 

did not possess while watching this 

film) that lends the film its gravitas, as 

the concept that it stares at so intently is 

all it has; the movie embodies its theme 

completely. For the most part, it does 

so well, keeping one engaged by way of 

being horrified, and baking in a number 

of satisfying twists as they learn more 

about the grim reality of the Hole. It’s 

only as the film crosses the 60-minute 

mark that its fumes run low and it 

ventures into increasingly uneven and 

abstract territory. 

are other films that have done 

better and more evocatively what “The 

Platform” does. “Snowpiercer” applies 

many of the same themes with much 

more panache (and less revulsion), so 

if you’re looking for a truly beautiful 

and keenly critical flick to stream on 

Netflix, “Snowpiercer” is your bet. 

But let’s face it: you’re (hopefully) not 

going anywhere anytime soon. So, 

after getting done with “Snowpiercer,” 

“The Platform” offers an excellent and 

delightfully disturbing distraction from 

staring out the window quietly, playing 

online Scrabble for the seventeenth 

time or whatever other acts of banality 

pandemic-induced 
free 
time 
has 

inspired.

‘The Platform’ pairs cannibalism 
and capitalism in gross-out satire

York, Beecher likely to return in 2020, Michigan’s seniors in limbo

If all things had gone 

according to plan, Michigan 

would 
still 
be 
playing 

hockey. 
The 
Wolverines 

would be two days removed 

from playing for a Big Ten 

Tournament championship, 

and even if they’d lost that 

game 
or 
the 
semifinals 

against Ohio State, they’d 

likely 
be 
preparing 
for 

an 
NCAA 
Tournament 

appearance 
this 
coming 

weekend.

But 

COVID-19 

happened. 

In one fell 

swoop, 

the 
NCAA 

canceled all 

remaining 

winter 

and 
spring 

championships and the Big 

Ten suspended play for all 

sports.

Now, instead of preparing 

for the NCAA Tournament, 

Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson is preparing to 

have exit meetings with all 

of his players. For some, 

that means figuring out if 

they’ll be returning to Ann 

Arbor next year or signing 

with their NHL teams.

Freshmen Cam York and 

Johnny Beecher — 2019 

first-round draft picks of 

the Philadelphia Flyers and 

Boston Bruins, respectively 

— have a decision to make 

about their futures. After 

the University encouraged 

everyone in the dorms to 

return to their permanent 

residences, both returned 

home and are taking time 

to reflect before having exit 

meetings with Pearson and 

his staff.

With the NHL season 

on pause, there’s no huge 

rush to sign 

for 
either 

the 
players 

or the teams, 

but 
Pearson 

knows 
the 

decisions are 

still 
coming 

sooner rather 

than later. 

“It’ll 

probably be good for them 

to go reflect a little bit,” 

Pearson said. “When we 

have our meetings, I think 

we’ll all be calmed down 

a little more over what 

happened and have a chance 

to reflect on some things 

and what we need to do to 

get where we want to go. I 

expect both of them to be 

back.”

For 
many 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
seniors 
— 

players like Luke Martin, 

Griffin 
Luce, 
Will 

Lockwood, 
Jake 
Slaker, 

Jacob Hayhurst and Nick 

Pastujov — things are a 

little trickier.

Lockwood, Martin and 

Pastujov were all drafted, 

and Lockwood has already 

signed with the Vancouver 

Canucks. But the Carolina 

Hurricanes, which drafted 

Martin in the second round 

in 2017, and the New York 

Islanders, which drafted 

Pastujov in the seventh 

round in 2016, haven’t made 

any signings at all after 

the college season ended — 

leaving the players in limbo. 

Pastujov finished tied for 

second on the team in goals 

with nine and was third in 

points with 18. Martin led 

Michigan 
in 
plus-minus 

at 
plus-10 
and 
finished 

second in the nation with 85 

blocked shots, while playing 

huge minutes and forming 

the backbone of the top 

penalty-killing unit.

“I think you see some 

teams sign guys they’re 

interested in, some teams 

kinda slow things down,” 

Pearson said. “It’s hard. 

It’s hard on a guy like 

Luke Martin, who had a 

tremendous year.”

It’s especially hard for 

players like Slaker, Luce 

and Hayhurst, who weren’t 

drafted and thus are free 

agents. Some NHL teams 

have continued to sign free 

agents — there have been 

nine such signings across 

the league — but for the 

most part, talks have slowed 

down significantly for most 

teams.

Slaker is Michigan’s most 

attractive prospect, having 

led the Wolverines in goals, 

assists 
and 
points 
this 

season with 31 total points 

in 33 games — topping his 

previous season-high of 27, 

in seven fewer games. Luce 

has attended a couple of 

NHL development camps 

as a stay-at-home blueliner, 

and 
Hayhurst’s 
second-

half 
goal-scoring 
surge 

will likely attract some 

attention, 
perhaps 
from 

teams at the AHL level.

For now, though, all they 

can do is wait.

“A few of the free agents 

have signed,” Pearson said. 

“It’ll be interesting. … Slaker 

had his best year. I know 

Slaker’s had some interest 

and some offers, so we’ll see 

what goes on there.”

Adding an even deeper 

layer of complexity to these 

decisions is the question 

of whether winter sport 

athletes will get an extra 

year of eligibility from the 

NCAA. 
It 
seems 
highly 

unlikely at this point, but 

Pearson 
suggested 
it’s 

enough of a possibility that 

it’s keeping some players 

from signing deals until 

there’s 
a 
final, 
official 

decision.

“Some guys have slowed 

things down a little bit to 

wait to see what happens 

there, in case they might get 

another shot to finish what 

they started, so to speak,” 

Pearson 
said. 
“I 
think 

you’ll see another rush of 

signings once that comes 

out, hopefully in the next 

week or two.”

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

Freshman forward Johnny Beecher will likely return for his sophomore year, according to Mel Pearson.

I expect both 
(Beecher and 

York) to be 

back.

Answering three key questions about the Wolverines’ offense

In some alternate universe, 

an email would have hit 

the 
inboxes 
of 
reporters 

sometime last week. It would 

have announced the start of 

Michigan football’s spring 

practice, 
and 
contained 

a 
schedule 
for 
press 

conferences with players and 

coaches. More likely than not, 

it would’ve led off with coach 

Jim Harbaugh.

Of course, none of that 

happened. 
Instead, 
the 

Wolverines are at home along 

with everyone else. There’s 

no spring practice because of 

the COVID-19 crisis, and no 

chance for the media to ask 

questions of Harbaugh for 

the first time since January’s 

Citrus Bowl loss to Alabama.

Still, they remain pertinent. 

The Daily decided to break 

down three of the biggest 

questions surrounding the 

Michigan 
football 
team’s 

offense. Here they are:

Who’s 
winning 
the 

quarterback battle?

The 
need 
to 
find 
a 

replacement 
for 
Shea 

Patterson 
will 
dominate 

most of the conversation 

surrounding 
Michigan 

football until either Dylan 

McCaffrey or Joe Milton 

steps onto the field against 

Washington on Sept. 5. 

Despite a number of faults, 

Patterson 
was 
a 
proven 

commodity 
who 
averaged 

eight yards per attempt in two 

years as Michigan’s starting 

quarterback. 
McCaffrey 

and Milton both figure to 

have higher ceilings, if only 

because of the allure of the 

unknown, but both are just 

that — largely unknown. 

When he saw game action 

over the last two years, 

McCaffrey, a redshirt junior 

in 2020, mostly impressed 

with his legs, rushing for a 

44-yard touchdown against 

Wisconsin in 2018. As for 

Milton, he completed three 

of four passes on a late-game 

touchdown 
drive 
against 

Rutgers in 2019, after the 

contest became out of hand.

Of the two, McCaffrey 

seems the safer pick. He’s a 

year older, with more practice 

and game reps, while Milton’s 

accuracy and touch are both 

at question. Still, outsized 

arm talent makes Milton’s 

ceiling 
convincing. 
Going 

with the younger, potentially 

more 
erratic 
quarterback 

would represent a huge vote 

of confidence on Harbaugh’s 

part — as well as a notable 

risk.

How does Chris Evans 

work into the running back 

rotation?

The run game is a notable 

strength for Michigan going 

into 2020. Zach Charbonnet 

enters 
his 
sophomore 

year 
after 
a 
726-yard, 

11-touchdown 
freshman 

campaign as the probable 

starter, but Hassan Haskins 

could challenge him for the 

job. At minimum, the two will 

likely split carries as they did 

last season.

Things get complicated fast 

after that, though. Harbaugh 

announced in November that 

Evans, a senior who served 

an academic suspension for 

all of last season, would be 

reinstated for 2020. On top 

of that, Michigan also brings 

in four-star recruit Blake 

Corum 
from 
St. 
Frances 

Academy in Maryland.

Evans was never the full-

time starter from 2016-18, 

but always found himself 

well in the mix for carries. 

It’s unlikely that will change 

— it stands to reason that 

Michigan 
wouldn’t 
have 

asked Evans back had there 

not been a role envisioned 

for him. On top of that, he’s 

a talented running back who 

averaged 5.2 yards per carry 

in 2018.

Exactly 
what 
that 

translates to in terms of his 

role, though, isn’t clear. Based 

on the way Harbaugh’s done 

things in the past, it’d be 

surprising if we didn’t see 

a 
somewhat-even 
rotation 

between 
Charbonnet, 

Haskins 
and 
Evans 
in 

terms of carries. But it still 

would have been nice to get 

15 practices to see if any 

separation occurred.

The offensive line lost 

four starters — what does it 

look like right now?

Michigan’s offensive line is 

in a great long-term position. 

Last season, it was one of the 

biggest sources of consistency 

in the offense, with three 

seniors and Cesar Ruiz, a 

center who left early for the 

NFL. Just as important, it 

seemed then — and still seems 

now — that the Wolverines 

have the depth to withstand 

that kind of turnover, a credit 

to offensive line coach Ed 

Warinner, whose arrival two 

years ago helped flip the 

position into one of strength.

But redshirt sophomore 

right tackle Jalen Mayfield 

is the only returning starter, 

and the other four spots 

are somewhat up in the air. 

Redshirt sophomore Ryan 

Hayes 
seems 
the 
likely 

option to start at left tackle, 

as he played against Middle 

Tennessee State and Army 

when Jon Runyan Jr. was 

injured 
last 
season 
and 

acquitted himself well during 

that stretch.

Things 
get 
complicated 

on the interior, though. The 

Wolverines brought in a six-

man offensive line class in 

2019 — four-stars Karsen 

Barnhart, 
Nolan 
Rumler, 

Trente Jones and Trevor 

Keegan, along with three-

stars Jack Stewart and Zach 

Carpenter. Senior Andrew 

Stueber was in the thick of 

competition with Mayfield 

for the right tackle spot when 

he went down for the season 

with an ACL tear. Senior 

Chuck Filiaga has long been 

the subject of praise from 

coaches, but has yet to earn a 

starting spot.

It’s also important to note 

that without spring ball, there 

are 15 less times these players 

will practice, be evaluated 

and compete with each other. 

That leaves us doing a lot of 

guesswork.

As 
the 
two 
most 

experienced players of the 

group, it stands to reason that 

Stueber and Filiaga would 

have a leg up at left and right 

guard, respectively. As for 

the rest, Barnhart may be 

the most game-ready, and got 

snaps in two games last year. 

Carpenter played center his 

senior year at Archbishop 

Moeller, which could make 

him the best-equipped to 

replace Ruiz.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has historically gone with a running back by committee.


IMPACTFUL

In 
observance 

of 
Women’s 

History 
Month, 

The 
Daily’s 

sports section is 

launching its third 

annual series aimed 

at telling the stories 

of 
female 
athletes, 

coaches and teams at 

the University from the 

perspective of the female sports 

writers on staff. We continue the 

series with this story from Daily 

Sports Writer Shira Zisholtz.

The day was Nov. 7, 2018, when Anna 

Abrams’ dreams came true. 

Donned in maize and blue and 

accompanied by her parents, she signed 

a National Letter of Intent that allowed 

her to join the Michigan women’s 

gymnastics team. 

The Wolverines were bringing in a 

big recruiting class that year, but this 

signing was special.

Anna was just 13 years old, and in a 

wheelchair. 

***

Team IMPACT is an organization 

that allows children aged 5-16 with 

disabilities to be part of an athletic 

experience that would otherwise not 

be possible. The child gets matched 

to a team at a university and becomes 

part of that respective program for two 

years. 

Anna has mild cerebral palsy in 

her legs, but strives to maintain an 

active lifestyle. She has danced for 

more than 10 years and previously 

took gymnastics lessons, plays Miracle 

League softball and swims. Her family 

started a sled hockey team in their 

area and plays tennis with her and her 

friends. 

Knowing her daughter’s love for 

sports, Rhonda Abrams researched 

different organizations that 

would 
allow 
Anna 
the 

opportunity 
to 
find 

something new and 

be part of something 

bigger. 

One 
day 
at 

work in the C.S. 

Mott’s Children’s 

Hospital, 

Rhonda ran into 

someone 
who 

recommended 

Team 
IMPACT 

for Anna. 

“I 
researched 

different 

organizations 
and 

stuff, but Team IMPACT 

seemed to be the best suit 

for us,” Rhonda said. “They set 

this up and then took a step back, so 

all of this has been by the team and by 

Michigan. But if it weren’t for Team 

IMPACT, this wouldn’t have happened. 

We are so grateful.”

On the surface, Team IMPACT is 

focused on the lives of the kids that 

go through its program. But what isn’t 

always recognized is how the child 

changes the team’s life, too. 

“(Team IMPACT) kind of lets us be 

a part of our community in a way that 

we wouldn’t typically,” senior Maggie 

O’Hara said. “We get to interact 

with fans for a very small period of 

time, after the meets, but being able 

to actually share a team role with a 

younger kid who looks up to us — and 

who we get to be a friend to, and they’re 

a friend to us, is super cool. 

“Anna brings a lot of life to our team. 

She shows us a different perspective 

that we wouldn’t typically get on a 

daily basis. She just kind of approaches 

everything with a ‘Why not’ attitude, 

and I think that’s really special for us 

to see because we don’t typically have 

a lot of interactions that are like, ‘Why 

can’t I do this,’ or ‘Why shouldn’t I do 

this.’ And she’s kind of, like, ‘Well, I 

might not be able to do it the same way 

but let me show you how I can do it, 

too.’ ” 

***

As a member of the team, Anna fits 

right in — the wheelchair, the age gap, 

the basic difficulties don’t faze her. 

Her teammates have made an effort 

to spend time with her on and off the 

floor, in and out of the practice facility. 

“I would say last year, she kinda 

stuck to her people,” O’Hara said. “She 

was pretty close to me and (student 

assistant coaches Sam Roy and Polina 

Shchennikova). But this year, she’s 

definitely opened up to more people.”

This past year, Anna’s second year 

with the program, the team took time 

to start visiting her outside of the gym. 

They played with her dogs at her house, 

and even spent a day swimming with 

her. All that time they spent with her 

allowed her relationship with the team 

to grow even more. 

Now, she’s not just close to a select 

group of people. Instead, she fits right 

in with all 15 Michigan gymnasts and 

two student assistant coaches — the 

wheelchair, the age gap, her condition, 

none of them stand in the way of being 

a part of the team.

Anna’s favorite part of being on the 

team is just “hanging out with them,” 

she said. “They are my sisters.”

On her first day on the team, Anna 

was told to bring her energy and open 

up to be a part of the tight-knit family 

that is Michigan women’s gymnastics.

“And she took it to heart,” O’Hara 

said.

When she walks into the gym, she 

demands a hug from everyone. She 

runs floor music during practice. She 

whips around the facility to keep up 

with everyone else, making sure to be 

everywhere she can to stay engaged. 

She loves to be in the locker room with 

her teammates.

Meet day is the best day for Anna. 

When the Wolverines are at home, she 

has the same gameday routine as the 

rest of the team, even down to showing 

up at the same time as everyone else. 

She wears a warm-up outfit, gets her 

hair and makeup done, and gets a block 

‘M’ tattoo to wear. She sits in every 

team huddle and dances around to 

music before the meet. 

Not only does the team make sure to 

include her in all pre-meet rituals, but 

Anna is also out on the floor with them 

having fun during competition.

“When we’re out on the gym, me 

and her are always goofing off on the 

sidelines and just joking around and 

having fun,” Shchennikova said. “I’ll 

ride on her wheelchair a lot.”

But even in the moments that aren’t 

as fun, Anna’s there, too.

“When we’re in a tight situation and 

we’re all squeezing hands, she’s right in 

there with us,” O’Hara said. “It’s just 

reminding her that we’re doing this for 

our team.

“She’s 
very 
much 
there 
with 

everyone else.”

***

Anna’s life isn’t easy, by any means. 

And yet, she is the brightest, most 

positive girl in the room at all times.

“She never comes in with a bad 

attitude and (the team is) like, ‘Wow,’ 

” O’Hara said. “I knew a lot of people 

who never even knew what CP was and 

didn’t realize the extent that it could 

be. And she comes in and has the best 

attitude and wants to be there and she 

loves being there and she loves the 

people.” 

With a packed schedule and the 

stresses of college life, gymnasts 

can come into the practice facility 

complaining that they’re tired or sore. 

But Anna will come in after a 45-minute 

commute from Commerce Township, 

wheelchair and all, excited to be there. 

And that wakes them up. 

“It does remind us how fortunate we 

are to get to do what we do, but also 

how special it is that we get to have her 

on our team,” O’Hara said. 

“You can have an injury and feel 

sorry for yourself,” Michigan coach 

Bev Plocki said. “And yet, Anna’s been 

in a wheelchair and she makes no 

excuses. She just has a positive outlook. 

She goes and does the things that she 

wants to do. 

“Her attitude on life is just so positive 

and happy and smiling and I think 

that when times get a little bit hard 

for us you always have to remember 

whatever you’re going through there 

are other people suffering a lot greater 

hardships. So, put a smile on your face, 

chin up, you’ll make it through.”

When asked how she keeps such a 

great attitude, Anna doesn’t have an 

answer, and neither does her mom.

“This is literally her outlook, all the 

time,” Rhonda said.

***

Because Team IMPACT is just a two-

year program, Anna has to “graduate” 

from the team now that the season is 

over. But she knows that her sisters
