CAMPUS CRIME
- Settlement
rejected in
UMHS child
porn case

Agreement would
have dropped one
charge against
Jenson
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
The criminal case against
Stephen Jenson, a former Uni-
versity medical resident who
was arrested for alleged receipt
and possession of child por-
nography at the University of
Michigan Health System, is
still undergoing deliberations
nearly a year after his arrest.
Though Raymond Cassar,
Jenson's defense attorney, and
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mat-
thew Roth have come to a con-
sensus on an agreement after
months of negotiations, U.S.
District Judge Avern Cohn
reftaed to immediately accept
the iea agreement on Thurs-
day.
According to court docu-

ments, Cohn took the plea
agreement "under advisement,"
meaning he will not accept the
plea agreement at this stage in
the case.
The agreement, which was
released on Friday, would drop
a charge of receipt of child
pornography that is pending
against Jenson in exchange for
a guilty plea for possession of
child pornography.
A charge of receipt of child
pornography carries a mini-
mum of five to 20 years, while
possession of child pornogra-
phy carries a maximum sen-
tence of 10 years. The guideline
range for Jenson's offense is
70-87 months, according to
the agreement, which notes
that his sentence should not be
below 36 months.
If he is sentenced to prison,
the agreement calls for a super-
vised release of no less than 60
months after he serves the sen-
tence.
Per the agreement, Jenson
would also be required to join

University alum Eman Dabaja, a member of the Coalition for Tuition Equality, speaks at a rally in the Diag yesterday.

Students gather in
support of tuition
equality
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Staff Reporter
Seats reserved for University
President Mary Sue Coleman
and University Provost Philip
Hanlon may have remained
noticeably empty during Tues-

day's rally for tuition equal-
ity on the Diag, but that didn't
stop students invested in the
cause from demanding that top
administrators take steps to
ease restrictions on undocu-
mented students.
About 100 students gath-
ered at the steps of the Hatcher
Graduate Library where the
Coalition for Tuition Equality
- a partnership of various stu-
dent groups seeking to estab-
lish in-state tuition rates for

undocumented students living
in Michigan - hosted a "gradu-
ation" ceremony for undocu-
mented students to demonstrate
solidarity for the cause.
Public Policy senior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, the founder of
CTE, said the mock graduation
symbolized a momentous life
event that the coalition hopes
disenfranchised studentswillbe
able to experience in the future.
Though the coalition has made
progress in recent months, he

said he still isn't satisfied with
its current progress with Uni-
versity administrators.
"It's been slow going," Mer-
sol-Barg said. "I'm not sure if
our goals are concrete enough
in terms of where we stand and
where the University stands."

Former presidential
advisers share
insights from
White House
By LISSA KRYSKA
For the Daily
Though tax policy isn't often
on the minds of most students,
economists that previously
served in the administrations of
former United States presidents
urged awareness of financial
affairs at an event at the Ross
School of Business Tuesday.
Students, professors and Ann
Arbor residents gathered in Blau
Auditorium to hear four promi-
nent economists discuss the
tax policies of President Barack
Obama and Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney
and how different courses of
action could impact the country.
Mary Ceccanese - a research
process coordinator at the Busi-
ness School's Office of Tax
Policy Research who helped
coordinate the forum - said the

event was inspired by a similar
meeting held during the 2000
election at the University that
was designed to provide a clear-
er understanding of each candi-
date's tax policies.
"People need to hear what's
not being said on both sides of
the aisle," Ceccanese said.
Economists Bruce Bartlett,
Leonard Burman and Kevin
Hassett were featured panelists
at the event, while University
Economics Prof. Joel Slemrod
hosted the discussion. All four
have extensive backgrounds in
economic and tax policies from
working for Democratic and
Republican presidents.
Throughout the event, top-
ics ranged from the tax policies
of individual candidates to the
effect of the current political
climate on the country's fiscal
challenges.
Slemrod, who worked for the
Council of Economic Advisers
during the Reagan adminis-
tration, began the discussion
by reminding the audience of
America's long history with tax
policy debates, noting that even

ITI GOT A RING Tn IT

Making a LINK to N. Korea

Despite North Korea's long
history of human rights viola-
tions and divisive governmen-
tal ruling, students on campus
are working to raise aware-
ness of the challenges that the
country's citizens are facing.
Liberty in North Korea, also
known as LiNK, is a non-profit
organization based out of Tor-
rance, Calif. LSA junior James
Kim - president of the Uni-
versity's LiNK chapter, which
currently has about 50 mem-
bers - said the club tries to
separate the citizens of North
Korea from the stigma of the
country's controversial gov-
ernment.
University alum Jannet

Park, a former LiNK president,
said the goal of the club is to
raise awareness on the issue
of freedom in North Korea
through fundraising and infor-
mational programs.
"Most people just don't
know the issues at stake. (North
Korean) people are poor and
forced to live under this really
powerful communist regime,
but most don't realize why it's
such a big issue," Park said.
The University's chapter of
LiNK was founded in 2005, but
was forced to shut down by the
California headquarters two
years ago, which reorganized,
Park said.
Park relaunched the Uni-

versity's chapter in fall 2011.
LiNK's largest event is a
documentary screening each
semester by the LiNK nomads,
a group of committed vol-
unteers trained to promote
awareness. Park said last
year's documentary screening
of "The Hiding," focused on
North Korean refugees.
Last December, members
of LiNK also promoted a peti-
tion to pass the North Korean
Refugee Adoption Act, a bill
that passed the U.S. House of
Representatives last week that
aims to assist stateless North
Korean children.

Aghans shout anti-American slogans in the Ghanikhel district of Nangarhar province, east of Kabul, Afghanistan, Friday
during a protest against an anti-Islam film.
Militants claim Afghanistan
attack is revenge for film

Suicide bomber
kills 12 people on
Tuesday
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Islamic militants sought Tues-
day to capitalize on anger over
an anti-Islam video that was pro-
duced in the United States, say-
ing a suicide bombing that killed
12 people in Afghanistan was
revenge for the film and calling
for attacks on U.S. diplomats and
facilities in North Africa.
The attempt by extremists
across the region to harness Mus-
lim fury over a film that deni-
grates the Prophet Muhammad
posed new concern for the United
States, whose embassies and con-
sulates have been targeted, and in
some cases breached, during riots
and protests over the past week.
At the same time, Western
leaders welcomed statements by
Middle East governments that
condemned the violence against
diplomatic facilities on their soil,
even as they expressed anger

over the video. Some of those
governments replaced autocratic
regimes in popular uprisings that
swept the region, allowing for
greater leniencytoward protest.
At least 28 people have died
in violence linked to the film in
seven countries, including U.S.
Ambassador Christopher Stevens
and three other Americans killed
in a Sept. 11 attack on the U.S.
Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
The toll also includes 12 protest-
ers killed in riots overthe filmlast
week.
Some officials in Libya have
said the attack on the consul-
ate was planned in advance by
militants. However, the White
House said Tuesday the assault
appeared to have been sparked
by anger over the film, though the
investigation continues.
The crisis has become a major
foreign policy challenge for
Washington in the final weeks of
a presidential election campaign
that has largely focused on eco-
nomic challenges. The uproar
over the video, "Innocence of
Muslims," which was made by an

Egyptian-born American citizen
and posted on YouTube, reflects
seemingly intractable tension
between Western principles of
free speech and Islamic beliefs
that brook no insult directed at
the prophet.
The crisis offered fresh impe-
tus for Islamic militants who
have long plotted and carried out
attacks on Westerntargets.
Tuesday's attack in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, was carried out
by a suicide bomber who rammed
a car packed with explosives
into a mini-bus carrying foreign
aviation workers to the airport.
At least 12 people died, includ-
ing eight South Africans, three
Afghans and a citizen of Kyrgyz-
stan.
A spokesman for the Afghan
militant group, Hizb-i-Islami,
claimed responsibility for the
dawn attack and said it was car-
ried out by a 22-year-old woman
named Fatima. Suicide bomb-
ings carried out by women are
extremely rare in Afghanistan,
where few if any Afghan women
drive cars.

Feds: N.C. sheriff
targeted Latinos
A two-year investigation by

has found that a North Carolina
sheriff and his deputies routinely
discriminated against Latinos by
makingunwarranted arrests with
the intent of maximizing deporta-
tions.
In an 11-page report issued
Tuesday, the federal agency said
Alamance County Sheriff Terry
S. Johnson and his deputies vio-
lated the constitutional rights of
U.S. citizens and legal residents
by illegally targeting, stopping,
detaining and arresting Latinos
without probable cause.
The agency also said that
Johnson obstructed the federal
investigation launched in 2010
by withholding requested docu-
ments and falsifying records.
Federal investigators say mem-
bers of the department also
feared retaliation if they cooper-
ated.

Judge upholds
immigration law

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks after the teachers union House of Delegates voted to suspend their strike Tuesday.
Chicago teachers end
strike, return to school

98 percent of the
700-plus delegates
vote to end strike
CHICAGO (AP) - The city's
teachers agreed Tuesday to
return to the classroom after
more than a week on the picket
lines, ending a spiteful stalemate
with Mayor Rahm Emanuel that
put teacher evaluations and job
security at the center of a nation-
al debate about the future of pub-
lic education.
Union delegates voted over-
whelmingly to formally suspend
the strike after discussing details
of a proposed contract settle-
ment worked out over the week-
end. Classes were to resume
Wednesday.
Delegates poured out of a
South Side union hall singing
"solidarity forever."
"I'm very excited. I miss my
students. I'm relieved because
I think this contract was better
than what they offered," said
America Olmedo, who teaches
fourth- and fifth-grade bilin-
gual classes. "They tried to take
everythingaway."
Said Shay Porter, a teacher
at the Henderson Academy ele-
mentary school: "We ignited the
labor movement in Chicago."
The walkout, the first in Chi-
cago in 25 years, shut down the
nation's third-largest school dis-
trict just days after 350,000 stu-
dents had returned from summer
vacation. Tens of thousands of
parents were forced to find alter-
natives for idle children, includ-
ing many whose neighborhoods
have been wracked by gang vio-
lence in recent months.
Union Presifdent Karen Lewis
said the union's 700-plus del-
egates voted 98 percent to 2 per-

cent to reopen the schools.
"Wesaidthatwecouldn'tsolve
all the problems ofthe world with
one contract," Lewis said. "And it
was time to end the strike."
Tuesday's vote was not on
the contract offer itself, but on
whether to continue the strike.
The contract will now be sub-
mitted to a vote by the full mem-
bership of more than 25,000
teachers.
The walkout was the first for
a major American city in at least
six years. It drew national atten-
tion because it posed a high-
profile test for teachers unions,
which have seen their political
influence threatened by a grow-
ing reform movement. Unions
have pushed back against efforts
to expand charter schools, bring
in private companies to help
with failing schools and link
teacher evaluations to student
test scores.
The strike carried political
implications, too, raising the
risk of a protracted labor battle
in President Barack Obama's
hometown at the height of the
fall campaign, with a prominent
Democratic mayor and Obama's
former chief of staff squarely
in the middle. Emanuel's force-
ful demands for reform have
angered the teachers.
The teachers walked out Sept.
10 after months of tense contract
talks that for a time appeared
to be headed toward a peaceful
resolution.
Emanuel and the union agreed
in July on a deal to implement a
longer school day with a plan to
hire back 477 teachers who had
been laid off rather than pay reg-
ular teachers more to work lon-
ger hours. That raised hopes the
contract would be settled before
the start of fall classes, but bar-
gainingstalled on other issues.

Emanuel decried the teach-
ers' decision to leave classrooms,
calling the walkout unnecessary
and a "strike of choice."
Almost from the beginning,
the two sides couldn'teven agree
on whether they were close to a
deal. Emanuel said an agreement
was within easy reach and could
be sealed with school in session.
The union insisted that dozens of
issues remained unresolved.
Chicago's long history as a
union stronghold seemed to
work to the teachers' advantage.
As they walked the picket lines,
they were joined by many of
the very people who were most
inconvenienced by the work
stoppage: parents who had to
scramble to find babysitters or a
supervised place for children to
pass the time.
To win friends, the union
representing 25,500 teachers
engaged in something of a pub-
licity campaign, telling parents
repeatedly about problems with
schools and the barriers that
have made it more difficult to
serve their kids. They described
classrooms that are stifling hot
without air conditioning, impor-
tant books that are unavailable
and supplies as basic as toilet
paper that are sometimes in
short supply.
As the strike entered its sec-
ond week, Emanuel turned to
the courts to tryto force teachers
back to the classroom by filing a
lawsuit that described the walk-
out as an unlawful danger to the
public.
The complaint sought a court
order to end the strike, saying it
was illegal because it endangered
the health and safety of students
and concerned issues - evalu-
ations, layoffs and recall rights
- that state law says cannot be
grounds for a work stoppage.

Police to enforce
controversial Ariz.
law immediately
PHOENIX (AP) - A judge
in Arizona ruled Tuesday that
police can immediately start
enforcing the most contentious
section of the state's immigra-
tion law, marking the first time
officers can carry out the so-
called "show me your papers"
provision.
The decision by U.S. District
Judge Susan Bolton is the latest
milestone in a two-year legal
battle over the requirement. It
culminated in a U.S. Supreme
Court decision in June that
upheld the provision on the
grounds that it doesn't conflict
with federal law.
Opponents responded to the
Supreme Court decision by ask-
ing Bolton to block the require-
ment on different grounds,
arguing that it would lead to
systematic racial profiling
and unreasonably long deten-
tions of Latinos if it's enforced.
She said early this month she
wouldn't block it, and gave the
go-ahead Tuesday for the law
to take effect.
The section of the law
requires that officers, while
enforcing other laws, question
the immigration status of those
suspected of being in the coun-
try illegally. The "show me
your papers" name comes from
opponents.
Arizona's law was passed
in 2010 amid voter frustration
with the state's role as the busi-
est illegal entry point into the

vocative new study suggests a
connection between the BPA
chemical used in food packag-
ing and childhood obesity, but
the researchers say their find-
ings don't prove it's the cause.
While most people have
traces of the plastics chemical
in their bodies, the study found
that children with the highest
levels in their urine were twice
as likely to be obese as those
with the lowest.
There are other factors that
could explain the results, and
many reasons why children
gain too much weight, the
researchers said.
"Clearly unhealthy diet
and poor physical activity are
the leading factors contribut-
ing to obesity in the United
States, especially in children,"
said lead author Dr. Leonardo
Trasande of New York Univer-
sity.
But the study does hint that

variations on Arizona's law.
A call to the office of Gov.
Jan Brewer, who signed the
measure into law, wasn't
immediately returned Tuesday
afternoon.
A coalition of civil rights
groups is awaiting a ruling
from the 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals on their latest
effort to prevent the question-
ing requirement from taking
effect.
"Our next step is seeing
what happens with that," said
Linton Joaquin, a lawyer for
National Immigration Law
Center, one of the groups in the
coalition.
Some backers of the law
questioned the level of coop-
eration they will get from fed-
eral immigration agents, who
will be called to verify peo-
ple's immigration status and
be responsible for picking up
illegalsimmigrants from local
officers.
Federal immigration officers
have said they will help, but
only if doing so fits with their
priorities, including catching
repeat violators and identify-
ing and removing those who
threaten public safety and
national security.
If federal agents decline to
pick up illegal immigrants,
local officers in some cases will
likelyhave to let them go unless
they're suspected of commit-
ting a crime that would require
them to be brought to jail.

be more complicated, he added.
He said it isthe first national
research to tie a chemical from
the environment to childhood
obesity, and seems to echo
what some studies have seen in
adults.
One puzzling result: Signifi-
cant differences were detected
onlyinwhite children. For black
and Hispanic kids, obesity rates
were similar for those with the
lowest levels of BPA as those
with the largest amount. The
researchers couldn't explain
that finding.
The study was released Tues-
day and is in Wednesday's issue
of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
BPA, or bisphenol A, has
been used since the 1960s and
become so widespread that it's
found in virtually all Ameri-
cans. Government health offi-
cials have deemed low levels of
it to be safe, but haven't been
able to decide what amount
of BPA - if any - would be a
health concern.
BPA is used to make hard
plastics for food and beverage
containers and many consumer
goods and for metal can linings.
Environmental groups have
worried it interferes with chil-

dren's development.

NATO order limits collaboration
with Afghan forces in operations

U.S. troops now
required to always
carry weapons
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- NATO's decision to restrict
operations with small Afghan
forces to mitigate the threat
of insider attacks means fewer
boots on patrols and a shift in
how the U.S.-led coalition will
fight the war in Afghanistan.
It's unclear whether the
coalition's exit strategy can suc-
ceed with less partnering with
Afghan policemen and soldiers,
who are slated to take over for
foreign combat troops by the
end of 2014, just 27. months
from now. What is clear is that
the mantra that Afghans and
coalition forces are fighting the
Taliban "shoulder to shoulder"
is looking more and more like
they're standing at arm's length.
Earlier this year, the U.S.
military stopped training about
1,000 members of the Afghan
Local Police, a controversial
network of village-defense
units. U.S. commanders have
assigned some troops to be
"guardian angels" who watch

over their comrades in interac-
tions with Afghan forces and
even as they sleep. U.S. officials
also recently ordered American
troops to carry loaded weapons
at all times in Afghanistan, even
when they are on their bases.
Until now, coalition troops
routinely conducted operations
such as patrolling or manning
outposts with small units of their
Afghan counterparts. Under
the new rules issued on Sunday,
such operations with small-sized
units are considered no longer
routine and require the approval
of the regional commander.
NATO's decision reflected
escalating worries about the
insider attacks, coupled with
the widespread tensions over
an anti-Islam video that has
prompted protests around the
world, including Afghanistan.
Early Tuesday, a suicide
bomber rammed a car packed
with explosives into a minibus
carrying foreign aviation work-
ers to the airport in the Afghan
capital, killing at least 12 people
including nine foreigners -
eight South Africans, a Kyrgyz-
stani and three Afghans.
Haroon Zarghoon, a spokes-
man for the Islamist militant

group Hizb-i-Islami, claimed
responsibility, saying it was car-
ried out by a 22-year-old woman
named Fatima and was meant to
avenge the anti-Islam film that
ridicules the Prophet Muham-
mad.
But the underlying reason
for the new directive that curbs
contact between Afghan and
international forces is the spike
in insider attacks.
So far this year, 51 interna-
tional service members have
died at the hands of Afghan
forces or militants wearing their
uniforms. That is more than 18
percent of the 279 international
troops who have been killed in
Afghanistan since the begin-
ning of the year, according to
figures compiled by The Associ-
ated Press.
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta argued that the attacks
do not mean the Taliban are get-
ting stronger. "I think what it
indicates is that they are resort-
ing to efforts that try to strike at
our forces, try to create chaos
but do not in any way result in
their regaining territory that
has been lost," he told report-
ers during a press conference in
Beijing.

Central Student Government has taken major steps to provide

full advantage of this opportunity, and CSG should continue
to provide students healthy and affordable alternatives to the

More than just a minority

The events in Libya this past
week once again pushed a'
minority to the forefront
of national dia-
logue. Tensions
flared in the
Middle East as
anti-American
protests mani-
fested in multiple
countries. And
then, just as the HARSHA
news cycle was NAHATA
dying down from NAHATA_
this, a Newsweek
cover entitled
"Muslim Rage" pushed Islam back
into the spotlight.
On Sunday, Sept. 16, I was at a
summit for the Coalition for Tuition
Equality. The summit included rep-
resentatives from a wide variety of
organizations on campus, and CTE
took the opportunity to engage us in
a dialogue about social justice.
We were asked to talk about what
social justice means to us and what
issues of social justice we notice
around campus. When this question
came up, one of the girls in my small
group - Zeinab Khalil, President of
the Muslim Students' Association
- made an interesting point. She
mentioned that whenever anything
Islam-related happened around
the world, people automatically
expected MSA to comment on it or
in some cases condemn it. In many
of these instances, the events are far
removed from the students involved
in MSA - they're happening on the
other side of the world. But still MSA
was held to a different standard,
being treated not just as a student
group, but as something more - as
some sort of a corporation or coun-
try that was obliged to apologize or
condemn or respond to huge nation-
al and international political events.
This really struck me. I under-
stand why MSA is in this position.
Being a minority, they're ina unique
position to have an opinion on these
issues that people want to hear. But,
at the same time, it seems people are

forgetting that there's more to MSA
as an organization - there's more to
people than their minority status.
I'm Indian, and I remember
whenever the caste system used to
come up in Social Studies or His-
tory classes, teachers and classmates
would always look to me for a com-
ment. Even now, in political discus-
sions, whenever South Carolina Gov.
Nikki Haley or Louisiana Gov. Bobby
Jindal is mentioned, all heads auto-
maticallyturn my way. For some rea-
son, I'm expected to have thoughts
to share with my peers on all things
India-related.
The same can be said for the
shootings in Wisconsin. While they
were a truly tragic event and many
Sikh communities took the initia-
tive to speak out on their own, many
others also were expected to, by the
rest of us, simply because they were
the minority that was affected.
And in many cases minorities
do have a unique opinion on cer-
tain social and political issues,
especially those that affect them
more directly. But, that's not to
say they have an obligation to talk
about these issues every time they
come up or even an obligation to be
knowledgeable about them. Being a
minority is only one part of some-
one's identity. We all have varying
likes and dislikes and diverse inter-
ests.
Another student at the CTE dis-
cussion, Brock Grosso from Stu-
dents Organizing Against Prisons
built on this point. He emphasized
how the burden of explaining social
injustices and educating people
about these issues tends to fall on
the minorities affected. It's true
- we look to those who are disad-
vantaged to educate us about the
problems and barriers that they
face. We expect Muslims to raise
awareness about Islamophobia,
Sikhs to educate people on hate
crimes or Hispanics to fight the
immigration battle.
Being a minority isn't synony-
mous with being the face of an issue.

Just because someone comes from a
background that has ties to an issue
doesn't oblige them to be an expert
on the topic by any means. Yes,
being of a particular minority gives
one a unique perspective on issues
that more directly involve that
minority. And yes, often minori-
ties share a personal connection to
certain issues that can't be found
among others. Should they share
their unique perspective? Absolute-
ly. But that doesn't mean they have
to be singled out whenever that
issue comes up.
Being a minority
isn't synonymous
with being the
face of an issue.
Awareness of social justice issues
and political concerns isn't just the
responsibility of the minorities.
Regardless of who these issues are
impacting, we all have an obligation
to be aware of what's happening in
our societies and communities. And
if we ever want to make progress in
solving these issues, we all have to
make efforts to engage in learning
about them.
Minorities do come from back-
grounds different from the gen-
eral population - that's why they
are considered a minority. But we
often forget that that's not all they
are. Whether it's a racial minority,
ethnic, religious or socioeconomic
- being a minority is only one char-0
acteristic of identity. And while
most minorities don't mind discuss-
ing that aspect of their identity, it's
not something they should auto-
matically be expected to talk about
any time an opportunity comes up.

Smoking ban brings privacy
pros and cons into question
TO THE DAILY:
I read the editorial regarding the smoking
ban with interest. No such thing existed when
I was a student at Michigan in the 1970s. I
began to smoke cigarettes when I was a soph-
omore. I managed to quit the New Year's after
my son was born in 1984.
I've seen the progression from warning
labels to the first smoking restricted areas,
to smoke-free workplaces, to cities banning
smoking in all restaurants, to cities banning
smoking altogether.
The stance taken by The Michigan Daily
is notable for its altruism and for the values
that guide the editorial board. Of course, this
is the way the world should work. Freedom
and choice is better than no freedom and no
choice. Self-enforcement is better than peer-
enforcement. A world without stigma is better
than one with stigma.
But, that isn't how the world works. As a
nation, we've been struggling with this ques-
tion for 50 years, going back to the early '60s
when the Surgeon General first publically
announced smoking's health risks. We're all
educated.
And we're all free ... mostly.
And smokers behave like addicts.
The Daily proposes the expense of dollars
and resources in an effort to reduce or elimi-

nate smoking, which are designed to affect this
voluntary behavior. Hardly seems fair to the
non-smokers. And, it won't work. It never has.
I only managed to quit when I put myself in
a position in which I had no choice. I couldn't
smoke. I found the lack of choice to be the only
effective means of quitting. Freedom, no mat-
ter how precious, was the enemy of the effort.
Absent a pricing solution that's beyond our
control, forced abstinence may be the only
guarantee of achieving the desired result.
I think the Daily is asking, or addressing,
the wrong question. Isn't the real question one
of cost and benefits? Is the societal cost of the
ban worth the results? Is that loss of freedom
worth the benefits of a smoke-free campus?
I think that's the only question, because the
voluntary versus non-voluntary question has
been settled.
All laws that restrict our freedoms should
be viewed in this light. Consider laws that
restrict drinking, freedom of speech, mari-
juana consumption or cigarettes.
As a society, we must place a very high value
on personal freedom and only enact laws that
restrict those freedoms when the benefits are
clear and well-articulated. Only then are we
able to makea decision based on the principles
of a free democracy.
Is the cost of the ban worth the expected
benefits? Tough question.

1978 University alum

We've been in school for
two weeks now, and the
initial excitement that
accompanies
coming to Ann
Arbor for anoth-
er school year
is beginning to
be tempered by
the reality of
school. Even in
the short time E
since school
started, we've FERGUSON
all undoubtedly
heard about the
impending presidential election.
Elections always bring an air of
excitement to the fall season, but
this specific election is particularly
important and relevant to college
students. Nov. 6, 2012 will be our
opportunity to exercise a right that
people all over the world have died
for and continue to fight for. It's the
time we have a voice in choosing
who will hold what is arguably the
most powerful office in the world;
it's our chance to point the country
in a direction of our choosing. For
the first time in our lives, we will be
able to exercise one of the most fun-
damental rights guaranteed by the
American system - the rightto vote.
In this country, voting isn't just
"pretty much a big deal"- it's prob-
ably the biggest deal regarding gov-
ernance that Americans have ever
received. Every few years, Ameri-
can citizens have the option of
kicking out the sitting members of
legislature and the chief executive
and installing other people in their
places using votes. Such a regular
transfer of power, controlled by the
citizenry, simply doesn't exist in
many other countries around the
world. Our version of democracy

extends to the legitimacy of elec-
tions as well. Unlike many countries,
there is virtually no one saying that
our elections are illegitimate.
When you vote for a candidate,
you are effectively saying that you
would rather have that candidate
represent you in government than
anyone else on the ballot. Every one
of these candidates has some kind of
framework that specifies how he or
she will behave in office. Political
parties are a part of that framework,
providing a lens for voters to look at
candidates through. We therefore
have both the person and the party
platform to consider when deciding
how to cast our vote. Ourvoting sys-
tem is designed to result in the elec-
tion of officials who are qualified to
do their job and represent the largest
possible segmentof society. The way
our current government and elected
representatives have been acting
leaves the voters wanting more.
Theoretically, our fellow Ameri-
cans have elected to office people
who represent themselves. If so,
why does Romney have so much
support as a deficit reducer when
he lacks a specific plan to tackle the
issues most central to our budget
crisis? Why is budget sequestration,
a measure that will probably throw
our economy into another reces-
sion, being discussed by members
of Congress as an acceptable or even
preferable alternative to budgetary
compromise? And why did Obama
sign a potentially unconstitutional
measure allowing an indefinite
detention of Americans on Ameri-
can soil?
It's imperative that those of us
who are new voters keep all aspects
of our candidates in mind as we
decide who to vote for in this elec-
tion, no matter how uncomfortable

that may be. We can't change who
is on the ticket in November this
late in the election season, and as a
result, some voters may end up per-
ceiving their ballot as a long list of
choices between lesser evils. If that
situation arises, we, as new voters,
should seek compromise by voting
for a candidate who represents us
better than the other candidates,
and in the future help nominate
candidates who will do a better job
of representing our generation in
the government.
If you dislike
government for
any reason, vote
to change it.

Neither presidential campaign is
paying attention to this state, since
its electoral votes are very likely to
go to President Obama. That should
be completely irrelevant to voters of
any age. Voting isn't just about put-
ting someone in the White House
for a four-year period. Voting is
about having your own voice heard
on the local, state and national lev-
els of government. If you're a newly
eligible voter and having such a
voice doesn't appeal to you, think
of one thing you dislike about gov-
ernment in America. If even one
thing comes to your mind, where's
the sense in passing up your first
opportunity to do something 6
about it?

Though the University offers

the executive board still lacks a

CSG treasurer Chris Osborn,
an LSA junior who was promot-
ed from last week's provisional

status at the meeting, presented
a resolution to approve the fall
budget. Osborn and the chair of
the Student Organization Funding
Committee were both provision-
ally confirmed last week to allow
CSG to begin funding student
organizations.
According to the budget resolu-
tion, CSG has $350,865 in revenue
for fall 2012, $261,865 of which
comes from the $7.19 student fee
and $89,000 in roll-over funds
from last semester.
The budget's main recipient
is SOFC, which was allocated
$156,875 of the total fund. The
remaining funds are dispersed
throughout CSG to its commis-
sions, programs and various dis-
cretionary funds.
However, that value could be
significantly lower in fall 2013 if
RSG secedes from CSG, taking
one third of CSG's annual revenue
while implementing an entiiy
new student government on eaif-
pus explicitly for graduate stn-
dents.
CSG president Manish Parikh,

proposed secession at the meet-
ing, defending CSG's commitment
to graduate students and the indi-
vidual student governments of the

work and the Latino Students
Organization.
Central Student Government
President Manish Parikh, a
Business senior, said he attend-
ed the event not only to display
CSG's support, but also to pro-
vide guidance to the student
activists struggling to work with
University leaders.
"One of those aspects of
advice is to keep working with
the administration, and to keep
treating the administration, who
are their elders, with respect and
kindness," Parikh said.
Sanjay Jolly, a public policy
graduate student and repre-
sentative from the University's
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, spoke next, and
apologized to Parikh for ignor-
ing his suggestions of politeness
before starting an impassioned
speech about the administra-
tion's lack of support.
"I have one thing to say," Jolly
said to a cheering crowd. "Stop

LSA senior Chris Askew-Mer-
win, a coalition member, said he
believes the group would make
faster progress with the Univer-
sity if it hosted more dramatic

demonstrations like student sit-
ins to attract the attention of
administrators.
"I'm worried that rallies won't
accomplish as much as they
should," Askew-Merwin said. "I
think the way that we could real-
ly show the power of the student
body is by doing something a bit
more visible."
Public Policy senior Eli Day, a
member of Students Organizing

to see the strong turnout for the
event.
"I think it's a righteous cause,"
Day said. "I think it's good to
highlight the linkage between

for certain demographics and
the causal relationship with that

Engineering senior Kanchan

"I think the more languages
you know, the more intelligent
you are because you are learning
not only the language, but you're
learning the culture with it,"
Rogovyk said. "It's like buy one,
get one free."
LSA sophomore Jamie Nadel,
who studies Yiddish, said he
appreciates small class sizes
because it offers more one-on-one
attention to each student.
"The professors are amazing
and it is a very tight-knit com-
munity ... not too many people are
interested in Yiddish so we grab
onto the people that are," he said.
While studying a less common
language has its benefits, Nadel
said finding textbooks can be
tricky.'
"Textbooks can be a little
expensive, but they are not
exactly diverse in their teaching
method so they can be a little con-
fusing," Nadel said.
Rachel Ross, an LSA sopho-
more concentrating in Judaic
Studies, said a disadvantage of
pursuing a less commonly taught
language is its lack of applicabil-
ity.
"If you don't have a specializa-
tion in that area, or if you're not
planning on going to the small
countries or cities that speak that
one dialect or that one particular
language, then you really won't be
able to practice it," she said.
Ross said while it can be hard
to find practical uses for unique
languages, like Swahili or San-
skrit, they provide an insight into
other parts of the world.

"You are opening your mind
up to different aspects of smaller
areas of a certain culture (more
so) than if you would have just
learned it from a history book,"
Ross aid.

used globally, it could one day
become more commonly used,
especially with its ties to Spanish.
"Language always changes. It
changed in the past and itnchanges
in the present," Fulgencio said.
LSA sophomore Isha Iyer, who
is studying Hindi, said the variety
of language courses helps pre-
pare students for the competitive
nature of today's world.
"The University offers such a
wide range of language courses to
enable students to become more
active members of our increas-
ingly globalized world," she said.
"Michigan is always striving to
create a well-rounded generation
of students, and language learn-
ing is a crucial part of any educa-
tion."
Elise Lawley, an LSA sopho-
more studying sign language,
said she enjoys learning a unique
language because it brings atten-
tion to a deserving community of
people.
"I find it fascinating to learn
(about) a culture that is over-
looked most of the time," Lawley
said. "They have a language that
should be respected just as much
as Spanish or German."

the American Revolution start-
ed as a tax revolt.
He added that a major differ-
ence between the budget plans
of the candidates is Romney's
focus on cutting entitlements
and Obama's push toward rais-
ing taxes, two very different
approaches to deficit reduction.
Burman, who served as dep-
uty secretary for tax analysis in
the Clinton administration, said
Obama's budget plan was too
complicated and could have bet-
ter accomplished its objectives in
more efficient ways.
He specifically noted that the
Buffett Rule - which mandates
that high-income earners pay
an income tax rate of at least 30
percent - risks creating anoth-
er Alternative Minimum Tax,
which was originally intended to
tax the wealthy, butended up tax-
ing the middle class.
Hassett, a senior economic
adviser to Sen. John McCain (R
- Ariz) during his 2008 presi-

dential campaign, said in an
interview before the event that
Obama isn't prepared to solve
budgetary problems.
"Obama doesn't really have a
plan at all," Hassett said.
A major critique of Romney's
plan from all three speakers was
that he hasn't actually provided a
detailed plan.
Burman said he feared that
Romney's plan could lead to a
repeat of challenges under the
Bush administration, where the
former president alleged that tax
cuts were accompanied by failed
promises to cut spending. He
said ultimately this led to large
increases in the deficit and a
financial crisis when the expect-
ed economic boom didn't occur.
Despite promises by candi-
dates to alter the tax code to fix
the economy, Bartlett - who
formerly served as deputy assis-
tant secretary for economic
policy during the Reagan and
Bush administrations - said past
reforms had little effect on the
economy-at-large

"People make extravagant
claims about what tax reforms
can do," Bartlett said.
When discussing the nation's
current economic woes, Hassett
said the combination of a high
deficit and large future financial
obligations has created a prob-
lematic situation.
"Deficits are large and the
promises we made are even larg-
er," Hassett said.
Burman said the private sec-
tor could play a substantial role
in revitalizing the economy, but
is inhibited by hesitancy to begin
spending again due to an uncer-
tain economic climate.
While tax codes and policies
may seem like daunting topics,
the speakers agreed it is impor-
tant for students to educate them-
selves on the matter, so they can
be informed voters and citizens.
In an interview after the event,
Burman said if fiscal policy isn't
changed, students will end up
bearing the burden, so it's criti-
cal that they inform themselves
on the issue.

the federal sex offender reg-
istry and would be mandated
to update the registration for
at least 20 years, and possibly
throughout the rest of his life.
University of Michigan
Health System officials waited
six months to report a fellow
resident's account of discover-
ing Jenson's child pornography
in the residents' lounge in May
2011. In an internal review of the
case released in February, Uni-

versity President MarySue Cole-
man called the delay a "serious
failure on the part of the institu-
tion."E
Cassar pointed out that Cohn
may be concerned with the sen-
tencing in the case because Jen-
son possessed a small amount of
child pornography compared to
other offenders.
University Police seized 97
photos and four videos of child
pornography from Jenson's
home last December, as opposed
to most offenders who accumu-
late thousands of images and
videos, Cassar said.

Cassar said Cohn was also
apprehensive thatthe agreement
waives Jenson's right to appeal
a conviction for possession of
child pornography, as well as his
right to appeal a sentence if it
doesn't exceed the maximum of
10 years.
Though it's often common
practice for federal prosecutors
to include a waiver of appellate
rights, Cassar said Cohn is a
"very fair judge," and showed his
concern for Jenson's legal rights.
Cassar said he and Roth will
wait to see what action Cohn will
take in the coming months.


different schools and colleges at
the University.
"There have been allegations
that we focus only on undergradu-
ate issues. I don't think that's the
case," Parikh said. "I think it's
important for all of CSG to treat
other student governments on
campus as equals rather than little
brothers."
However, LSA representative
Arielle Zupmore, an LSA senior
and former member of LSA stu-
dent government, said "serious
action" would be needed to pre-
vent other student governments
from becoming similarly disinter-
ested in CSG.
FIRST PROPOSED RESO-
LUTION SEEKS INCREASED
ACCESSIBILITY TO GOOGLE
APP
Aside from administrative pro-
cedures, Rackham representative
Patrick O'Mahen presented the
first resolution of the semester on
disability accessibility to the Uni-
versity's recently launched Google
applications.
The resolution argued that
the newly implemented Google
applications aren't accessible for
some students with disabilities,
citing the National Federation
for the Blind and other disability
awareness activists who have filed
litigation against similar Google
applications at other universities.
Two members of the Graduate
Employees Organization, includ-
ing its president Katie Frank,
addressed the assembly about the
issue, noting that GEO has taken a

personal interest in the matter.
The resolution, which is only in
its firstread, calls for CSGto inves-
tigate the issue and begin working
with University administrators to
correct it.
O'Mahen, a former Michigan
Daily columnist, said the issue
could use "big public presences" to
garner support, citing the actions
of the Coalition for Tuition Equal-
ity and the crowd of supporters it
brought to the University's Board
of Regents meetings.
However, he also stressed
the importance of meeting with
administrators to work within the
University.
ASSEMBLY SPEAKER
SEEKS TO ENFORCE ATTEN-
DANCE
Assembly speaker Michael
Proppe, a Business junior, said he
will begin enforcing representa-
tive attendance to committee and
commission meetings since the
committees, commissions and
positions of CSG have solidified
and become more functional.
Proppe added that despite
past disinterest in the commis-
sions and committees, simply
enforcing attendance among
representatives could remedy
the situation.
"I think the representatives
are all pretty motivated people
and that if they are showing up
to committee meetings, they are
not going to want to be wast-
ing their time talking about the
football game last week; they're
going to be doing work," he said.

continue to make adjustments
before going into large-scale

Spc. Gilliann Campbell, 22,
called the new body armor
"a dream" compared to the
old vests. A former gymnast,
Campbell said she feels much
more flexible in the new vests
and demonstrated that with a
couple of cartwheels.
"I remember as a joke, my
friends tipped me upside down
and my old armor fell right off
me. It didn't fit me at all. But
with this, I did a cartwheel
when I first got it and it did not
move at all," she said.
Small differences in the
vests, like having enough space
on her shoulder to set her rifle
or being able to get the armor
on quickly, can be critical when
you only have seconds to react
in combat, Campbell said.
"I feel safer in my own abili-
ties because it lets me do what
I need to do as a soldier," she
said. "With my other armor, I
felt a fear in my head that I was
not able to perform to the best
of my abilities. Now I can."

Sustainable fun at
Earthfest 2012

Annual event to
bring awareness to
the Diag
By JOEY STEINBERGER
Daily Arts Writer
Can sustainability be fun?
Is it possible to throw an eco-
friendly party big enough for
the entire Uni-
versity to
attend? The 2012
organizers EarthFest:
of EarthFestP
2012 think so. Paityfor
"(Earth- the Planet
Fest) is a pro-
gramto engage Tomorrow
and educate at10a.m.
the campus The Diag
community
on what we're
doing from a sustainability
standpoint," said Andrew Berki,
manager of the Office of Cam-
pus Sustainability.
2012 EarthFest: Party for
the Planet is an annual sustain-
ability event organized by stu-
dents and the Office of Campus
Sustainability. The event will
have food, entertainment and
giveaways. Rufus, the recycling
mascot of the University, is also
set to make an appearance.
Around 40 booths will be
constructed at EarthFest. About
half will be student groups such
as the Student Sustainability
Initiative and Environmental
Issues Commission. The rest
will be Campus Operation Units
such as Utilities for Energy
Reduction and Grounds and
Waste Management Recycling.
The booths will be divided
into four major themes: cli-
mate action, waste prevention,

healthy environments and com-
munity awareness. The themes
are based off of goals for sustain-
ability that University President
Mary Sue Coleman set last year.
In the beginning, student
involvement was limited.
According to Berki, 17 years ago,
the event was previously called
EnergryFest and was run by the
University of Michigan's Utili-
ties department.
"We really wanted to change
it from being an operations-
driven exercise to a student-
led exercise to engage students
more," he said.
The change broadened the
focus of the event from Campus
Operations to sustainability as a
whole at the University. Educa-
tion and research groups soon
joined the event, such as the
Graham Environmental Sus-
tainability Institute.
"It's been really successful
the past couple of years." Berki
said. "We've had huge partici-
pation. Students seem to love it.
Faculty and staff seem to love it.
So it's been good and we're hop-
ing for good weather."
The event aims to be zero-
waste. Free tote bags (made
from the banners used to adver-
tise the event) and GoBlue reus-
able lunch boxes will be given
away in a raffle as part of the
drive to engage students.
"We want to collect every-
thing and get it recycled and
composted," Berki said. "We're
really trying to be conscious
right down to the little details
about those kinds of things."
One of those "little details"
will be the food, which will be
handed out without plates as
part of the no-waste effort. In
addition, no plastic will be used
in the event.

"We want to be able to do
something that's not going to
create waste. So whether that's
going to be apples or cider or
doughnuts we're not sure yet.
But there will be some food."
This fall, the University
unveiled a new bicycle rental
program, Blue Bikes, that will
be at the event. The Blue Bikes
program will have more than
one rental site so students can
return the bike in different plac-
es from where they rented.
EarthFest is the one of the
biggest annual sustainability
related event on campus. The
Office of Campus Sustainability
holds other smaller events on a
more frequent basis.
"There are sustainability
town hall meetings which we
host that are open forum,"
Berki said. "There is one com-
ing up on Oct. 4. We've reached
out to many student groups to
talk about sustainability issues
(there)."
Berki hopes that Earth-
Fest will lead to more student
involvement with sustainability
issues on campus.
"We like to see a broad stu-
dent representation in (sus-
tainability) groups," Berki said.
"So not only students from the
School of Natural Resources
or the PITE program but we're
really trying to encourage stu-
dents from engineering and the
med school and all over. Stu-
dents are critical to moving the
sustainability agenda here on
campus."
Though EarthFest is primar-
ily a means to educate the cam-
pus about sustainability issues,
the organizers also want people
to have a good time.
"Sustainability is fun," Berki
said. "I enjoy it everyday."

Cute, lyrical 'Kiss'

Jepsen establishes
herself beyond
'Call Me Maybe'
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
Carly Rae Jepsen's debut as a
relevant artist has managed to
put the "bubblegum" back in pop
music, and all it
took was atweet ****
from the Biebs
about his dis- Carly Rae
covery of a song
called "Call
Me Maybe." Kiss
Even with an
abundance of Polydar
producers col-
laborating on the album, the simi-
larity in instrumentation brings
each track together as part of the
same Carly Rae family.
The beats might be thump-
ing in Kiss, but additional light-
hearted, high-pitched melodies
in tracks like the album's second
single, "This Kiss," allow for cute,
girly music that listeners can still
bust a move to.
Though Jepsen is a recent hit,
longtime artists like Jennifer
Lopez and Christina Aguilera
could learn from her. These art-
ists let electronic music domi-
nate their sound, rather then
letting their sound dominate
the instrumentation. By sticking
with high-toned synths and all
the other bells and whistles -
pun intended - Jepsen embraces
computer-driven production as a
complement to her style, rather
than defining it. Examples of
this are heavy in the record's
first track, "Tiny Little Bows,"
which is well-placed in the
tracklist, immediately preparing
the listener to expect a playful,
lovestruck, juvenile girl. Admit
it - Jepsen is fairly immature for
a 26-year-old woman.
Still, the beat to each track

could use some variety. The sandy
kick-clap gets dull after the ten
songs it's featured in. This will
most likely go unnoticed though,
seeing as it's not a huge contribu-
tion to the music and most Carly
Rae enthusiasts are casual music
listeners.
There are two collaborations
on the album, both a perfect fit
for the demographic. Owl City,
the male parallel to Jepsen's
sweet, innocent, synth-pop style
is featured on their Top-10 song
"Good Time," while her Cana-
dian partner-in-crime, Justin
Bieber, is found on the track
"Beautiful." This adds an extra
cuteness factor since Bieber is
responsible for Jepsen's rise to
fame. Directioners (One Direc-
tion fans) be warned, there is
some lyrical familiarity in the
Canadian pop stars' duet, with
the phrase "what makes you
beautiful, is you don't know how
beautiful you are." Prepare for a
plagiarism war waged between
15-year-old girls everywhere.
Above all, it's about time a
pop artist started putting a hint
of effort into their lyrics. Jep-
sen's lyrics don't always flow too
well, but she does use vocabu-

lary that goes beyond describing
what takes place in a Las Vegas
strip club. The world has waited
far too long for a song like "Call
Me Maybe," a song that's iconic
enough for people to incessantly
annoy their friends with, to a
degree almost beyond the Britney
classics.
There's even amusing lyrical
content in songs that aren't as
single-worthy. "Your Heart Is a
Muscle" cleverly mixes the figu-
rative and literal in portraying
the heart (love) as being a muscle
that needs to be exercised. In the
bonus track, "Sweetie," Jepsen
refers to her love interest as an
"eighth-world wonder." A little
effort goes a long way in shift-
ing the listener's attention from
music to lyrics.
Nobody can say that something
sounds like a Katy Perry, Britney
Spears or Jennifer Lopez song
because nobody really knows
what that sounds like anymore.
But now that Ms. Jepsen has
proven herself as being more than
a one-hit wonder, people will soon
begin to hear colorful, comput-
erized bubblegum pop and say,
"This sounds like a Carly Rae Jep-
sen song!"

Hot Fuss was an album of easy

Justin Kirk
("Weeds") stars as Dr. George
Coleman, a veterinary sur-

patients, but despises their own-

human counterparts become a
permanent problem after the
arrival of new management at
the animal hospital in the form of
Dorothy (JoAnna Garcia Swisher,

Dorothy's arrival squelch-

However, his constant disobedi-

The problem is that there's no

their teammates battle through to play Saturday evening. after sitting out four weeks of the

beginning of the season with an
Achilles tendon injury she suf-
fered during in nonconference
play early in the season. During
the Tiger invitational in Mis-
souri at the end of August, McEl-
heny, the team's captain, first felt
the pain and was sidelined after
last playing against Virginia
Tech. This injury requires time
and patience to limit the amount

of stress and pressure put on it.
"I was looking for a magic
cure there for awhile," McEl-
heny said. "They just don't have
it, though. I did a bunch of treat-
ment, but the biggest thing is
rest."
In the end, resting meant that
the veteran was unable to prac-
tice or compete for almost a
month, forcing Michigan coach
Mark Rosen to shuffle his lineup.
McElheny, Michigan's lone
senior first returned to action
against Eastern Michigan on
Friday morning, tallying just
two kills and a block in her lim-
ited time. But she aggravated
her injury, forcing her to miss
the match against Western Ken-
tucky later that night.
On Saturday, McElheny
entered the game against the
Blue Devils in the second set, her
team trailing 20-17, and recorded
a kill right away.
In the next set, McElheny
recorded a solo block that helped
cap a 11-1 run. McElheny ended
her night with two more kills, as
part of a rally from a three-point
deficit.
"She's more experienced than
anyone else in the gym." Rosen
said. "She's also very unique.
Her offense is more off of one
foot and it's very fast, so it cre-
ates a very different dynamic. All
of the sudden we go from a very
vanilla offense - pretty good but
very predictable - to a very fast
dynamic offense."
Despite McElheny's absence,
the Wolverines have still gone
12-2 to open the season, but fell
from the top 25 this week. The

senior's return couldn't be at a
better time, though, as McEl-
heny will bring her experience
to a young lineup that heads into
Big Ten play on this week.
And she'll begin Friday, hav-
ing picked up more knowledge
from her position on the sideline.
"I've gotten a different per-
spective standing on the side,"
McElheny said. "I think with
what I'm seeing, I can still help
give input and stay engaged."
Michigan faltered in Big Ten
competition last year, finishing
12-0 in nonconference before
going 8-12 in conference play.
This season, the Wolverines
have avoided putting too much
pressure on themselves as they
begin competition in arguably
the toughest conference in the
country.
Michigan opens up against
Indiana (8-2) on Friday and con-
cludes the weekend on Saturday
night with a matchup against
Purdue (9-2). With No. 3 Nebras-
ka and No. 4 Penn State in the
conference, a good start will be
key to the Wolverine's season.
"We're trying to go out an
play our best game every night
and not focus on the other team
instead of us," McElheny said.
"In years past we've approached
a loss like 'How do we handle
that?' and now we're not over-
exaggerating."
But McElheny has priorities of
her own to worry about as well.
"I need to focus on not taking
any reps for granted," McElheny
said. "I need to make each point
count because I'm not going to
get that back."

Tapping into a foreign culture
By Zach Bergson

Name: Lyndsey Twining
Age: 20
Hometown: Midland, Mich.
School and Year: LSA junior
Concentration: Asian Languages and Culture
Where do you like to hang out in Ann Arbor?
I spend a lot of time in North Quad. I like to study in
beautiful or good-looking places, so studying at the UGLi
doesn't really work for me. Occasionally, when I'm having
fun, I'll ga to the Korean karaoke places.
I didn't know there was Korean karaoke in
Ann Arbor.
There's two main karaoke places that are more oriented
towards Korean-style karaoke. In Korean it's called norae-
bang - which means song room. It's not like American
karaoke. You go into this room and there are couches and
it's a small environment. I'm not a huge party person, so if
I do go out and have fun it's either food, coffee or karaoke.
What's your favorite Korean restaurant in Ann
Arbor? Is Rich J.C. truly rich?
I usually go to Rich J.C. and I also went to Maru before it
closed. I think it's kind of a mixbetween personal opinions
and recommendations. I'm a vegetarian so I can't eat a lot
of Korean food ,which all of my Korean friends pity me
for - soI usually stick to a couple kinds of food.

What are you watching and listeningto lately?
I really like Korean hip-hop music and Korean indie pop.
But I also like K-pop, which is really famous, like now
everyone knows "Gangnam Style," so that's like the most
famous Korean K-pop song. I know the dance to ("Gang-
nam Style").
Do you listen to any American music?
There was a phase when I was younger where I liked coun-
try, punk music and typical indie hipster music. But once I
started getting into Korean culture, I started listening to
mostly Korean songs. It's actually kind of hard - I feel out
of touch with American music sometimes, because I don't
know who sings a song and everyone else seems to know
the song. I'm not totally unaware of the American music,
but I don't actively seek it out.
How did you, as a native Caucasian Michigander, get
so involved in Korean culture?
When I was in middle school, my two best friends were
Korean twin sisters and they used to talk to each other in
Korean occasionally or pass notes in class in Korean and
I became curious. I'd ask them about the language, cul-
ture and pop culture. They moved away after freshman
year of high school and even though they weren't there
- there are almost no Koreansin my hometown - I still
kept watching theTV.showsand listening to the music.

Once I came to U of M, the Nam Center for Korean Stud-
ies, where I work right now, encouraged me and my
interest in Korean studies by letting me volunteer and
participate. I've been in various Korean interest groups
around campus, but now I spend most of my time with
Sinazoro, which is a Korean drumming group.
What is Korean drumming?
The type of Korean drummingthat we usually do is called
Samulnori. That literally means playing for instrument.
There are four different percussion instruments, two
drums and two bongs. We play sitting down and we have
a certain repertoire that we play from. But originally the
style of music and the rhythms and the melodies came
from something called Pungmul - a kind of traditional
Korean farming music.
How would you describe the Korean community on
campus?
I think the Korean community here is very big and more
diverse than it seems. There are just such a range of people
that are very Korean American and Americanized, and
there are other people who come straight from Korea and
might have trouble with the language.
For me being a non-Korean person who's interested in
the culture, there's always some challenges. I think my
understanding of the language helps me get by, so at least
I know what's going on even though I don't know detailed
nuances.

It's difficult to think of Ann Arbor as any-
thing but a college town.
While they don't declare their pres-
ence as forcefully, an older demographic
constitutes a large chunk of the city. Accord-
ing to the 2010 U.S. Census, Ann Arbor resi-
dents 65 and older comprised 9.3 percent of
the total population, but those as young as 50
are choosing to settle here post-career.
Retirees who choose to settle in Ann
Arbor are a different breed from the warm-
weather-seeking, golf-playing folks we
usually associate with a senior population.
That's not to say that there's anything wrong
with Boca Raton or Honolulu, but those who
choose to retire in Ann Arbor say they have
priorities beyond just the weather.
Marlene Ross, 71, is an Ann Arbor retiree
and a volunteer docent at the University of
Michigan Museum of Art. She still lives in
the large, modern house her husband built
and has a strict no-shoes policy inside her
home, making visitors' shoes a hot commod-
ity for her dog Mokzy.
Though she originally hails from New
York City, Ross said Ann Arbor has more
than enough culture to satisfy her.
"I would never leave Ann Arbor," Ross said.
"It's a small town with big city opportunities."
Ross pointed to the University Musical Soci-
ety as one such opportunity. As a volunteer for
UMMA, she has free access to many University
exhibits and musical performances. Ross said
she has seen the acts that perform at Carnegie
Hall in NewYork performon campus.
Ann Arbor's thriving restaurant scene is
also a big bonus for Ross.
She noted that on one trip to Manhattan,
the man at the deli counter told one of her
familymembers: "If your aunt isvisitingfrom
Ann Arbor, she has the best Jewish delicates-
sen in the country," referring to Zingerman's.
"What more can you ask for?" Ross said.
"The culture,' the political' limate; tOnVe-

nience, unbelievable convenience of living in
a small town and yet having all this."
Health is wealth
It's worth noting that a large part of what
makes Ann Arbor a retirement hotspot is the
University.
In a recent study published by the Milken
Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, Ann Arbor
was ranked the seventh small metropolitan
city for successful aging in the United States.
According to Conrad Kiechel, the Milken
Institute's director of communications, col-
lege towns are particularly well-suited to
thriving retirement communities.
"One of the reasons that university
towns did very well," Kiechel explained, "is
because people know about how universities
enrich the cultural offerings for people in
their community."
Another benefit the University provides is
its world-class medical programs and facili-
ties, which Kiechel said is the primary reason
Ann Arbor scored so well in Milken's study.
Bob Pickering, 69, an Ann Arbor retiree
who lives in the University Commons, said
he and his wife initially moved to Maui,
Hawaii to retire, but two weeks after the
move, opted to relocate to Ann Arbor for
medical reasons.
"Family compelled us to comeback and med-
ical reasons compelled us to come back," Pick-
eringsaid. "And frankly, we like Ann Arbor."
Pickering met his wife at the University,
and housing on campus was the first place
they called home.
Lifelong learning
For many retirees, Ann Arbor's oppor-
tunities extend into the academic realm.
A nurpoff nstitutigns exist for the sole
prpoe*of ertating'a culture of intellectual

stimulation for senior citizens.
One such institution is Ann Arbor's Osher
Lifelong Learning Institute, one of 117 life-
long learning organizations across the coun-
try located on college campuses that cater
specifically to an older clientele.
OLLI sponsors up to 120 classes and lec-
tures each year led by retired professors.
Anyone over age 50 is invited to attend these
outings and membership costs only $20 annu-
ally. Today, OLLI has around 1,280 members.
Founded by businessman and philanthro-
pist Bernard Osher, OLLI is based on the
idea that lifelong learning promotes mental
and physical health among older adults by
encouraging them to stay involved in activi-
ties and creating new friendships, according
to Abby Lawrence-Jacobson, OLLI's pro-
gram coordinator.
University Commons, a 55-plus com-
munity, is another University-affiliated
institution that caters to retirees seeking
intellectual engagement.
Founded by retired University faculty,
the Commons - a condominium community
available only to those with a four-year col-
lege degree - hosts concerts, offers lectures
by community members and has weekly
meetings to discuss worldly issues, accord-
ing to Commons resident Karen Gotting.
Gotting, 71, said if you're looking for
a warm place to settle down with tennis
courts, golf courses and allthe other typical
Florida retirement stereotypes, the Com-
mons isn't your solution.
"It's a place where people are very astute
in terms of being politically aware of what's
going on," she said.
A homogeneous city
But despite the cultural pride that that
Ann Arbor's senior population exhibits, its
racill composition is largely-homogenous.

Only 8.9 percent of Ann Arbor's 65-plus pop-
ulation is African American, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau.
Part of this is attributable to a financial
disparity between the racial groups.
According to a study conducted by Nari
Rhee at the University of California, Berke-
ley, Blacks and Latinos are more commonly
in the lowest income bracket for retirees,
and poverty rates for retirees are twice as
high among those groups. Ann Arbor is no
exception.
Michael McGee, a financial planner
based in downtown Detroit, makes a con-
certed effort to reach out to the African
American community, which he said lacks
crucial access to financial advice. It is for
this reason, he said, that the black commu-
nity is often less prepared than whites to
retire.
"They maybe do not make the right moves
throughout their 30 years of employment
that someone else might make," McGee said.
McGee also said the general lack of diver-
sity in the city discourages many African
Americans from moving to Ann Arbor in the
first place.
McGee said he was one of only three Afri-
can Americans at a conference of 125 finan-
cial planners held at the University.
Nevertheless, McGee is optimistic
about the future of financial planning for
African Americans, noting that he has
seen significant changes over the past
decade in the community's knowledge of '
the subject.
He added that Ann Arbor might see a
change in its retiree demographics as a
result of this knowledge. This shift would
hopefully further enhance the cultural
opportunities afforded by Ann Arbor to
its elderly residents, and keep Tree City a
popular place for sexagenarians to settle,
down.

wanted to be.
"My mom, although she grew up in Damascus, was the first
female in her immediate family to wear the head scarf," Safi
ow_ said. "(My parents) were very encouraging that we be people
who practice the faith ... but I think as we grew up, as we
became in our teens and later on, I think it was really up to us
to make those decisions."
In 1997, when Safi was 13, his father died from complica-
tions due to hepatitis. The years that followed were difficult.
To be close to family, his mother relocated Safi and his sisters
to Damascus for nine months, where Safi said he was not wel-
comed by the kids his own age.
"The Syrians never saw me as Syrian ... they saw me as an
other," Safi says. His experience in Syria was not unlike simi-
lar prejudices he had confronted growing up Syrian in the
United States.
Upon returning to the United States, Safi began to fill the
role that once belonged to his father. "He had to man up,
become the man of the house," his sister Leenah said.
And yet, Safi refrains from calling his father's death the
"trigger" that put him on his spiritual path.
For him, religious enlightenment came only after years of
self-discovery and traveling.
These travels would take him to the University of Michi-
gan (both the Dearborn and Ann Arbor campuses), return
him to the Middle East and, ultimately, the desert of Yemen.
Fork in the road
A year and a half out of college Safi was at a crossroads.
He'd been living in Egypt, studying Arabic, and his next step
wasn't clear. Many thought his decision should be easy: pur-
sue a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies at the University of Chicago.
But Safi had other ideas on his mind.
A close friend, Omar Mahmood, had just returned from a
school in Yemen with a focus on studying Islam from a more
spiritual, eastern-style approach. After much deliberation
and reflection, Safi knew this was what he needed.
The name of the school, Dar Al Mustafa, literallytranslates

to "Home of the Chosen One." Located in the secluded town
of Tarim, it's a place that fits with the stereotypical image
Westerners might have of Yemen.
"Very, very sandy, brown," Safi says.
Founded by direct descendants of the Prophet Muham-
mad, Tarim is built around religious scholarship, like a college
town with a spiritual twist. Safi said the idea is for students to
leave the school "embodying prophetic character."
The school is based on three disciplines: "Calling to God
and his messenger," "Religious Knowledge" and "Purifica-
tion of the Soul." For one year, Safi's days were consumed by
the studying of religious texts, assisting the needy and calling
people to prayer and worship.
Safi laughs when I bring up the decision to move to Yemen
over Chicago. Departing from his typical professorial tone, he
fixes me with a stare that's boyish in its sincerity. For the first
time, I feel like I see the man others have lauded over the past
few months, ever since he took the chaplaincy back in Janu-
ary.
"I was going through kind of a spiritual search ... I wanted
to find what my heart was looking for," he says. "And I really
did find that in my trip to Yemen."
Uncrossing his legs, he takes a deep breath and continues.
"I think humans all have a void in their heart that they try to
fill ... I think that void is put there by God on purpose because
that void is God. To fill it you can only fill it with God, right?"
His voice wavers, as though he's asking me, like he's not
quite sure of the answer.
I'm reminded of an encounter I had one year ago while
studying in the woods of Maine at the University's New Eng-
land Literature Program:
For one day, Credo Day, the instructors told us to think
about how belief affects us in our lives. I quietly scoffed.
Because belief equates to faith, and faith translates to reli-
gion. And this was something I've always found unsettling.
I spent that whole day avoiding prayer circles that had sud-
denly sprouted up around our camp. I sought out Jono, the
only other student who seemed to find our day's task as ridic-
ulous as I did. He was smoking in the gazebo when I found

him, reclining on a wooden bench, legs propped up on a log,
his typical state of nonchalance. I was looking for solidarity.
But Jono didn't appear disgruntled. When I asked why Credo
Day wasn't bothering him, he merely smiled, took a bite from
his apple and lit another cigarette.
"Because," he began, "I'm not a religious person or any-
thing. But I do consider myself spiritual ... I don't know if I
believe in God. Honestly, I don't know what I believe. But I
think it's important to be open to something that's, I dunno,
above us, I guess, ya' know?"
Jono wasn't planning to duck out of that evening's talk-
ing circle, where a Quaker-style meeting was scheduled for
people to openly discuss faith, as I was. Nor was he agonizing
over what to believe in. He seemed content.
. Both Jono and Safi seemed to have opened themselves up
to misunderstanding, to confusion, to not knowing how to fill
the void.
A discussion
My feelings about spirituality and religion begin to feel
increasingly misguided the longer I speak with Safi. I inquire
as to whether he has any thoughts on the matter. Citing
Islam's teachings, he explains what he views as the dichoto-
my that's emerged between the two in modern times.
"In modernity there's this common distinction between
the crude, legalistic person and then the wayfarer spiritual
person who throws out the law," he says. "And that's not in
Islam. In Islam, a person can't be spiritual if they don't seek
to apply what God wanted of them ... Islam preaches a bal-
ance between theology and law and spirituality."
Maybe Safi's appeal, the reason some refer to him can-
didly as "spiritual," is because he radiates this balance. It's
comforting. The wayfarer mixed with the traditional con-
formist.
"He's been in the world," Blauvelt tells me. "Tayssir's
been in the world of the Muslim that comes to Ann Arbor
who believes in Islam but isn't super adherent to it. It's not
a part of their identity. And they decide that they want to
make it part of their identity. He's been through
that transformation. I think that helps him talk
to a lot of people who are trying to go through it
themselves."
Before I leave my final interview, Safi leaves me
with a verse from the Koran he's committed to
memory. "The Koran says, 'Indeed in the remem-
brance of God, do hearts find peace.'"
Tranquility comes when one remembers and
returns to their creator, he says. Maybe that's what
my instructors had wanted us to understand all
along back in Maine. Not remembering God, but
remembering how to talk about what God repre-
sents: faith, the lack thereof, something deep in our
souls that lies vacant, restless, waiting to be filled.
I went in search of a holy man. I found him. And
in some ways he did fit the image I'd had in my
head - he journeyed away from society to a remote
part of the world; he references the Koran to better
clarify his points; he believes true peace comes the
closer one moves toward God.
Safi has called himself a "circuit," someone
who sparks connections between people. In many
ways, he exemplifies Karen Armstrong's advice:
The authority he carries doesn't really derive from
a greater knowledge of his religion or of God. It
stems from an openness to listen, to humble him-
self before whomever he sits with.
Maybe my discussion with Jono wasn't too dif-
ferent from the discussions Safi has with Muslim
students in his office. After all, while neither Jono
nor I were "believers," we had, whether we knew it
or not, opened ourselves to the discussion of belief.
And the discussionI think, may suffice.

Your words are his faith

t's a cold spring evening. I'm attending an interfaith
dialogue at the University of Michigan Hillel orga-
nized by a friend of mine for MuJew, the Muslim/Jew-
ish collaboration group. A man has assumed the spotlight,
not because he wants it, but because he was asked. His
manner is unassuming, yet assured. When he speaks, the
room goes quiet.
He launches into a brief anecdote of the West's misper-
ceptions of Islamic governmental structures, assuring us
that his knowledge on this matter is limited. His words
evoke a modesty that, for me, comes to characterize him.
Though such knowledge isn't required for his job as the
University's Muslim chaplain, Mohammed Tayssir Safi is
what one might call learned. He narrates with confidence
and a smile that all but envelops his face. He is, as friends and
family will tell me in the months to come, "spiritual." They
will repeat the word over and over again, until it hangs thick
in the air.
A position
I heard the stories about him before I actually heard him.
In February, National Public Radio ran a story on Safi,
explaining his significance as "the first endowed Muslim
chaplaincy at a public university." The necessity of a chaplain
was so patent that a total of $30,000 was raised by alumni
and parents to pay Safi's salary. Nationwide, only 30 univer-
sities make room on their campuses for such a position. As
chaplain, Safi's duties include listening and advising students
of all faiths, though primarily the 850 Muslim students on
campus. He also works with other campus religious leaders
in addition to advocating on behalf of the Muslim Student
Association.
"It's an act of worship just to meet people: to talk to them,
to hear them, to listen to what they have to say so that you
can better serve them," Safi told the Daily in a profile earlier
this year.
I asked students who knew him, had heard of him, or had
maybe read about him, as I had. The responses I received
were overwhelmingly positive.
"He listens," said LSA junior Omar Hashwi, the Central
Student Government vice president, who had Safi as an Ara-
bic teacher. "He listens really well."
"Deeply personable, and incredibly sincere," said Chris
Blauvelt, who has known Safi since college and now lives in
Detroit.
But what really got me was the way Blauvelt described
his friend's method of offering counsel: "It's really like
you're getting advice from the prophet Muhammad, which,
as a Muslim, is like the best thingyou can have," he said. "So
it feels like this isn't just his opinion or, like, his whims ...
there's something of greater, eternal nature to his advice."
What would lead people to talk of this man as though he had
some kind of otherworldly insight? Was it just friends talking
up their buddy? When cynicism can seem like the default lan-
guage of a college campus, what would make students - Mus-
lim and non-Muslim alike - revere a man of the cloth?
As a non-religious person who tries to avoid the topic
altogether, I'm intrigued by someone so young - Safi is only
28 - who can project an honest spiritual presence, and have
young people respond accordingly. I wanted to know: Is this
guy for real? Call it the casual curiosity of a skeptic examin-
ing the life of a true believer.
A man of faith
"Can I get you anything, tea?" he offers, sitting cross-

legged in his chair.
Talking to Safi can be like trying to paint a secluded
piece of scenery. It's an act that focuses the mind, forcing
you to look at the most minute details of your surroundings
in a new light. Reclining in an office used by the Muslim
Students Association on the fourth floor of the Michigan
Union, he creates a congenial atmosphere. He is a man of
good cheer and humble stature, and often elects to meet
with students at local coffee shops as opposed to the MSA
office.
There's also an energy thatbubbles beneath his quiet exte-
rior. He's sharp, and he can spew facts as wide-ranging as the
plight of African-Americans in U.S. history to the psycholog-
ical turmoil college students endure. Yet for all his intellect,

religiosity. He says we have no idea how close we are to
God.
"Proximity to the divine is something only the divine
knows," he says, adding that when he was young, he hadn't
yet worked out his relationship and biases toward God and ,
toward Islam.
"I think that everybody's personal journey is different and
what that looks like is different. So I definitely was on my
own path during undergrad. And I think it only increased as
I left undergrad and I spent some time away from school."
Humble beginnings

By Jacob Axelrad
"Muhammad, when he received a revelation, used to go pale and sweat and struggle with
the effort to articulate the word of God. We should take a lesson from that, because all
of this facile God-talk has made the discussion of God actually impossible. Once you start
saying, 'I know what God is' or defining God, you have created an idol. Religious language
should be transparent to transcendence.".
-Writer Karen Armstrong, who has written 12 books on world religions, in an interview with The Believer magazine in June 2012.

Safi is a teacher. Rather than be prescriptive, he's more likely
to ask, What doyou think?
He reflects on some of the ways students are taught at
a school like the University, contrasting the eastern and
western models of education - he has had experiences
with both. His points are more observations than cri-
tiques.
"(In) the Muslim world, in the traditional sense, the
intent is to teach you character, to come to know God, to
become a better human being," he said. "It's not that you
walk out with a degree, or that you're able to get a job ...
which is very different from our current, modern model of
education, where alot of times the goal is literally that you
get a piece of paper."
Though he's a devoted person, he doesn't like words such
as "practicing" or "religious."
"That word - the word religious, the word practicing -
I'm a little uncomfortable with them. I don't really know
what to use," he said. I press him harder on this point. What
exactly does he mean? He is a "practicing" person, isn't he?
He elaborates, telling me how some people use the word
"practicing" to specify closeness to God, as a label of one's

thing you should choose for yourself. The son of Syrian
immigrants, Safi was born in Springfield, Ill. and raised
in Ann Arbor, graduating from Pioneer High School in
2002.
The areas in and around Detroit experienced a spike
in Arab Muslim immigrants in the early '90s, doubling
Detroit's Muslim population between 1973 and 1993, which
led to the construction of mosques, school and community
centers.
Safi explained, however, that unlike many Muslim stu-
dents who might come from households centered around
mosques, his upbringing was more separate from those types
of communities.
"I think I've been around strong mosques and I under-
stand how they work," he said. "But I also understand the
other side of things where people just kind of grow up
without a strong community around them and how that
pans out."
While religion was present in his home, his parents had
decided on their own to devote themselves to the Islamic
faith. Though they encouraged their four kids to do the
same, the choice was theirs as to how "practicing" they
