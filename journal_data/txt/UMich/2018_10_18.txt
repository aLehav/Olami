Two prominent educational 

and professional institutions 
— the American Association of 
University Professors and the 
American 
Political 
Science 

Association 
— 
are 
urging 

the University of Michigan 
to 
reconsider 
sanctions 

imposed on American Culture 
professor 
John 
Cheney-

Lippold. 
Cheney-Lippold 

recently 
became 
ineligible 

for a salary raise for one year 
and ineligible for sabbatical 
credits for two years after 
rescinding his offer to write 
a letter of recommendation 
for 
a 
student 
studying 

abroad in Israel, as part of an 
academic 
boycott. 
Cheney-

Lippold was joined last week 
by Rackham student Lucy 
Peterson, a Political Science 
graduate student instructor 
who also declined to write a 
letter for a student studying 
in Israel. Political Science 
prof. Juan Cole published a 
blog post over the weekend 
announcing he would also 

refuse 
reccommendations 

for students studying in the 
occupied West Bank. 

University 
graduate 

students also published an 
open letter last week with 
over 200 signatures affirming 
their support for Cheney-
Lippold and Peterson.

Interim 
LSA 
Dean 

Elizabeth 
Cole 
informed 

Cheney-Lippold of sanctions 
in a letter dated Oct. 3.

“Your conduct has fallen 

far short of the University’s 
and 
College’s 
expectations 

for how LSA faculty interact 
with and treat students,” Cole 
wrote.

In a letter from AAUP 

Associate 
Secretary 
Hans-

Joerg Tiede dated Oct. 16, 
Tiede claimed the sanctions 
on 
Cheney-Lippold 
violate 

the association’s standards 
of 
due 
process. 
These 

standards first call for an 
informal inquiry by a faculty 
committee 
to 
determine 

whether 
proceedings 

to 
impose 
sanctions 
are 

necessary and then call for the 

Wednesday 
night, 

students filled the Ford 
School of Public Policy’s 
Weill 
Hall 
to 
listen 
to 

Reihan Salam, a political 
commentator, columnist and 
executive editor of National 
Review magazine, talk about 
his ideas on immigration 
policy in his new book 
“Melting Pot or Civil War?”

The American Enterprise 

Institute at the University 
of Michigan, along with the 
National Review Institute 
and Young Americans for 
Freedom, 
hosted 
Salam. 

Clare Ath, the NRI campus 
outreach coordinator, said 
one of the main goals of her 
organization is to promote 
civil 
public 
discourse, 

which is why she helps 
bring conservative voices to 
college campuses.

“Our focus is to show that 

no political ideology should 
be trying to prove that 
they’re right, but they should 
be 
working 
to 
convince 

people to their side,” Ath 
said. “It isn’t a ‘we beat you,’ 
it’s a ‘let’s see where we 
can find commonality and 
come to the best solution 
together.’”

Salam noted the difficulty 

of having civil debate on 
a 
hot-button 
issue 
like 

immigration, for which both 
sides are so impassioned.

“Immigration is not an 

easy, slam dunk question 
at all,” Salam said. “There 
are 
very 
decent, 
good-

hearted people on every side 
of this debate, and there 
is a tendency we have to 
talk past each other in the 
debate, and the reason is 
because many of us feel so 
passionate about it.”

Salam 
spoke 
to 
the 

audience 
about 
how 
his 

proposed 
system, 
which 

calls for limited immigration 
and 
prioritizing 
high-

skilled immigrants, would 
better 
address 
issues 
of 

inequality, foster a sense 
of national solidarity, and 
create a balance of diversity 
and assimilation. Critics of 
merit-based 
immigration 

point out many industries 
in the United States rely 
on 
low-skill 
labor 
that 

generally raises economic 
output and reduces prices. 

He 
first 
talked 
about 

this 
idea 
of 
solidarity, 

referencing the book “The 
Paradox of Vulnerability: 

States, 
Nationalism, 
and 

the Financial Crisis” by 
John Campbell and John 
Hall, which claims societies 
that are smaller and more 
vulnerable 
to 
outside 

threats 
are 
more 
likely 

to 
develop 
cooperative 

institutions. With a higher 
influx of immigrants and a 
lower birth rate of American 
citizens, 
Salam 
said,

inclined to bond together for

Water quality raises concerns 
about pollutants across Michigan

ACADEMICS

2 associations, 200 grad students ask ‘U’ 
to roll back Cheney-Lippold punishment

Not much known about high levels of PFAS chemicals linked to increased risk of cancer

More than four years after 

the Flint water crisis, Michigan 
officials encountered a new 
challenge this summer when the 
Department of Environmental 
Quality revealed some water 
quality tests around the state 
— including in Ann Arbor — 
contained a toxic chemical called 

perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.

Brian Steglitz, manager of the 

Ann Arbor Water Treatment 
Plant, believes on a local level 
there is very little to worry 
about and the plant is handling 
the situation well. He explained 
the risks associated with PFAS 
were still largely unknown, 
though the chemical has been 
linked to an potential increased 
risk for cancer and other health 
problems in some studies. In 

September, Steglitz announced a 
“do-not-eat foam” warning at an 
Ann Arbor City Council meeting.

“The challenge with PFAS 

is that it is emerging,” Steglitz 
said. “We don’t have all the 
information we really need to 
assess what the risks are and 
what the safe levels are. I think a 
lot of that is going to come in the 
coming months and maybe even 
years.”

According to Steglitz, the 

water treatment plant has been 
testing treatment technologies 
for the past year and the 
city recently spent $850,000 
to 
implement 
an 
effective 

technology in all of the city’s 
filters. 

“In terms of PFAS, I think 

we’re very well-prepared to deal 
with this emerging contaminant. 
I feel extremely confident that

the water we’re delivering to 
our customers is safe,” Steglitz 
said. “We’ve been piloting new 
technology, a new granular 
activated carbon media in our 
filters, and we’ve been finding 
it to be successful at removing 
two of the PFAS compounds, 
PFOS and PFOA, that are part 
of the EPA’s health advisory. 
Because we’ve been piloting 
it and it’s been successful, we 
decided to put it in all of our 
filters.”

Laura Rubin, vice chair of 

the University of Michigan 
School for Environment and 
Sustainability advisory board 
and 
executive 
director 
of 

the Huron River Watershed 
Council, said it was difficult to 
accurately gauge the level of the 
threat because it is a new issue.

“We’re still in the process 

of 
identifying 
where 

the sources are and how 
pervasive they are throughout 
the watershed,” Rubin said. 
“Regularly, there are new issues 
that come up that we need to 
address. I would say a lot of our 
work is continual monitoring, 
continual work with our local 
government … we need better 
science and understanding on 
what current levels are okay for 
human health.”

Additionally, 
Rubin 

expressed 
frustration 
with 

the DEQ, which she believes 
is not doing enough to help 
the situation. Rubin said it is 
important for Michigan to be a 
leader in water safety because 
of its industrial past.

“Right now, the DEQ has 

been underfunded for a couple 
years and also been undermined 
by many of the current policies 
and practices, and especially 
at the EPA level there’s been a 
rollback of oversight and rules 
and regulations, so we would 

love to see more (regulations),” 
Rubin said. “Like many other 
states, it (Michigan) has a 
heavy 
manufacturing 
base, 

and because we have more 
manufacturing here, we have 
more chemicals and pollutants 
that have been released into 
the environment and into the 
groundwater and the rivers.”

Public 
Health 
student 

Alextia Armstrong, a member 
of the Environmental Health 
Student Association, interned 
at Ann Arbor’s treatment plant 
and is confident the discharged 
water is safe.

“In my opinion, students 

should worry about PFAS as 
much as they worry about every 
other emerging pollutant in any 
of our resources/environment,” 
Armstrong wrote in an email 
to The Daily. “Seeing how hard 
its (AAWTP’s) staff worked 
every day to provide a quality 
source of drinking water to 
many 
households 
in 
Ann 

Arbor/Townships, 
I 
believe 

that students shouldn’t be 
too worried about AAWTP’s 
ability to come up with and 
implement effective solutions 
to this problem. My only 
recommendation for students 
to stay safe is to become 
educated.”

While the situation in 

Ann Arbor might be under 
control, State Rep. Yousef 
Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, believes 
the problem is statewide and 
changes are needed. Earlier in 
September, Rabhi led a group 
of legislators who penned a 
letter to Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 
calling on the state to address 
high PFAS levels. 

“The 
first 
piece 
of 

legislation I introduced was 
a bill that, if it had passed, 
would have made companies 
that polluted pay to clean up 
the damages,” Rabhi said. “In 
Ann Arbor, the town council 
created a solution, but it was 
expensive, and that money 
still came from the taxpayers. 
Taxpayers shouldn’t have to 
pay to clean up a mess they 

didn’t make.”

Rabhi also stressed far-

reaching 
effects 
of 
clean 

drinking water are not always 
fully considered. He felt it was 
unjust many communities in 
Michigan do not have access 
to clean drinking water, while 
the state’s contract with Nestlé 
Waters North America pumps 
576,000 gallons of water per 
day from Michigan for $200 a 
year.

“In Michigan, we’ve had 

schools that have had to be 
closed 
down 
because 
they 

didn’t have clean water,” Rabhi 
said. “Clean water doesn’t just 
impact drinking, when this 
happens it impacts education 
and our public schools … and 
while all this is happening, 
Nestlé is allowed to take 
water, basically for free, from 
Michigan. I introduced a bill 
that would tax Nestlé just a 
small amount, a few cents per 
gallon, which would go towards 
funding our public schools. 
Republicans in Lansing didn’t 
pass it.”

Universally, 
most 
agree 

concrete standards for the 
acceptable amount of various 
chemicals within the water are 
needed. Steglitz believes there 
will be regulations sometime 
in the future, though preferably 
from a federal, not state, level.

“I 
think 
it’s 
clear 
that 

something needs to happen 
related to these chemicals,” 
Steglitz said. “Our preference 
would be the federal government 
and the EPA take the lead on this, 
because there are states that are 
already legislating maximum 
contaminant limits for these 
compounds, and they’re all doing 
it differently … The problem 
with all states taking their own 
initiative is it’s really difficult to 
message to customers: Why are 
these chemicals more dangerous 
in one state than another state? 
We would prefer that they (the 
federal government) use science 
to develop a standard that they 
can apply across the board, and 
then we can all follow that.”

Many 
years 
prior 
to 

joining University faculty 
in 1985, Conway worked at 
IBM Research, where she 
was fired when she began 
her gender transition. After 
retiring from the University 
in 1998, Conway started

her 

transgender 
history 
and 

has worked for the past 20 
years to protect and expand

people.

Nabel, 
president 
of 

Brigham 
Health 
and 

professor of medicine at 
Harvard Medical School, 
has also been recommended 
to 
receive 
an 
honorary 

Doctor of Science degree. 
Nabel 
was 
previously 

worked at the University 
Medical School and was 
named 
director 
of 
the 

Cardiovascular 
Research 

Center in 1992. She was 
appointed 
Michigan 

Medicine’s 
chief 
of 

cardiology in 1997 and was 
the first woman to fill the 
role.

As 
a 
renowned 

biomedical 
researcher, 

Nabel 
has 
focused 
her 

research on furthering the 
understanding of the genetic 
causes 
of 
cardiovascular 

diseases. She has authored 
over 250 articles, holds 17 
patents and served as the 
director of the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute at the National 
Institutes of Health.

Dove, 
a 
Pulitzer 

Prize-winning 
poet, 
is 

scheduled to receive her 

Doctor of Fine Arts at 
Winter 
Commencement. 

Dove 
joined 
University 

of 
Virginia 
faculty 
in 

1989 and is currently a 
commonwealth 
professor 

of English. She was named 
U.S. poet laureate in 1993, 
the second woman, first 
African 
American 
and 

youngest person to carry 
the title ever.

Former 
President 
Bill 

Clinton awarded Dove the 
National Humanities Medal 
in 1996 and former President 
Barack Obama presented 
her with the National Medal 
of Arts in 2011. She is one 
of only four authors to ever 
receive both awards.

Hackett is set to receive 

his 
honorary 
Doctor 
of 

Laws 
degree. 
Hackett 

received his Bachelor of 
General Studies in 1977 
and played football under 
coach 
Bo 
Schembechler. 

After graduation, he worked 
for and eventually became 
president 
and 
CEO 
of 

Steelcase Inc., making him 
one of the youngest CEOs 
of a Fortune 500 company. 
After retiring from this 
position in 2014, Hackett 
became 
the 
University’s 

interim athletic director. 
Hackett 
began 
his

oversaw new branding for 
the department following 
scandals surrounding the 
departure of predecessor 
Dave 
Brandon. 
He 

negotiated the University’s

the future generations.

“One thing you see happen 

is that in societies where you 
have smaller family sizes and 
population growth is chiefly 
coming from net migration, 
those 
societies 
are 
often 

societies where you don’t see 
the same level of enthusiasm 
in the idea of investing in the 
next generation,” Salam said.

A 2016 report by National 

Academics, on the other hand, 
found children of immigrants 
contribute 
more 
to 
state 

fiscal coffers than do other 
native-born Americans, while 
immigrants make up roughly 
14 percent of annual economic 
output. 

Salam claimed issues of 

social 
mobility, 
instability 

created 
by 
populism 
and 

ethnic inequality would be 
exacerbated by open border 
immigration policy. He said 
when immigrants first come to 
the U.S., they largely become 
a part of the working class, 
which can create feelings of 
isolation and anger.

“If you are increasing the 

number of folks who are 
vulnerable to technological 
displacement or competition, 
you’re then creating a class of 
people who have every reason 
to believe that they’re being 
cheated by the system,” Salam 
said.

To face these challenges, 

Salam wants to put in place 
an immigration policy that 
favors 
skilled 
immigrants, 

thus 
tightening 
the 
labor 

market 
for 
lower-skilled 

workers and giving them more 

opportunities.

“Given those challenges, 

it makes sense in the future 
to say let’s have a skills-
based immigration policy, in 
which we prioritize people 
who will be able to provide 
for 
themselves 
and 
their 

families,” Salam said.

In response to a question 

about how law enforcement 
should work at the border, 
Salam emphasized his belief 
that immigration policy goes 
beyond what happens at the 
border. One point he made 
was many people who want to 
emigrate to the U.S. have no 
means to do so.

“Dealing with the situation 

reactively – we are just going 
to react to the people who 
show up at the border – does 
not actually deal with the 
underlying crisis,” Salam said. 
“And the underlying crisis 
is a crisis of public security, 
that there are hundreds of 
thousands of people who are 
in no position to move.”

A Diag demonstration last 

week by the Latinx Alliance for 
Community Action, Support 
and 
Advocacy 
criticized 

inhumane enforcement at the 
borders. 

“There 
(are) 
people 
in 

Central America and all of 
these countries struggling and 
trying to come to the U.S. for 
more educational, economic 
opportunities, and who are 
facing violence, persecution in 
their communities...especially 
in interactions when it comes 
to border patrol,” LSA senior 
Yezenia Sandoval said last 
Tuesday.

Salam’s 
talk 
drew 
a 

number of people, including 
Engineering junior Naman 
Shah, an international student 

from Singapore. Shah came to 
Salam’s talk because he was 
curious about how people feel 
about immigration in the U.S., 
as Singapore is dealing with 
similar issues.

“I was invited by a friend, 

and immigration is a topic that 
we’re facing as well, so I’m 
just interested to hear another 
view on it from another 

country where the norms are 
different, 
the 
expectations 

are different,” Shah said.

PRISON CRE ATIVE ARTS PROJECT

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily

Artist Martin Vargas speaks about his art at the opening reception for his solo gallery “Painting His Way Home” at the Detroit Street Filling 
Station Wednesday. Martin is a self-taught artist who spent 45 years in prison. His work has been displayed at the Annual Exhibition of Art by 
Michigan Prisoners for the past 23 years and one of his works was acquired by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. 

as well as chemical and 
automotive engineers to 
the process of how these 
fuels will be created and 
utilized in the modern 
world. 
Cardinale 
said 

though other groups are 
researching 
this 
issue, 

different 
factors 
make 

their project unique.

“There’s 
two 
things 

that are unique about our 
project,” Cardinale said. 
“We are one of two, maybe 
three, universities in the 
world that have experts 
from the biologists from 
the chemical engineers to 
the automotive engineers 
that 
all 
work 
together 

in a unified sequence to 
grow algae in literally an 
open pond to putting it in 
an engine to determine 
whether 
or 
not 
we’ve 

designed them properly.”

The 
project 
initially 

began back in 2016 with 
funding 
from 
MCubed, 

an 
organization 
that 

gives funding to various 
research 
projects 
and 

ideas. This initial project 
led to a $2.5 million dollar 
grant from the National 
Science Foundation, and 
eventually 
allowed 
for 

the recent Department of 
Energy grant. Cardinale 
said he attributes much of 
the success of the project to 
the MCubed group.

“(The 
research 
team) 

would have never worked 
together, never even talked, 
I mean we’re not even on 
the same campus, and if 
it wasn’t for the MCubed 
getting us together for 
some 
preliminary 
data, 

we’d never have gotten 
$4.5 million in grants,” he 
said.

With 
the 
intent 

of 
working 
on 
an 

environmentally-conscious 
source 
of 
fuel, 
Andre 

Boehman, 
mechanical 

engineering 
professor 

and research team leader, 
said the recent reports 
by 
the 
United 
Nations 

Intergovernmental 
Panel 

on 
Climate 
Change 

reminded him of what the 
team is working for.

“Now we have a chance 

to make significant strides 
to improve sustainability 
transportation, and that’s 
really one of our major 
goals, 
is 
to 
make 
the 

transportation sector more 
sustainable,” 
Boehman 

said. “Since this weekend 
when the latest U.N. report 
from the climate change 
panel came out, things are 
accelerating it seems. The 
models which have said, 
‘Oh, you’re overpredicting,’ 
these 
dire 
predictions, 

things are actually worse, 
and they are getting worse 
faster, we have to act.”

LSA 
freshman 
Madi 

Foster said she is glad 
to see the school taking 
steps 
towards 
global 

sustainability.

“I 
feel 
like, 
overall, 

everyone should be doing 
more 
research. 
This 
is 

nice, but I feel like it’s a 
stepping 
stone,” 
Foster 

said. “Obviously our earth 
is getting worse from our 
inaction, but I think it’s 
good that we’re making 
these 
steps 
because 
it 

will lead to more action 
and eventually turn back 
climate change instead of 
making things worse.”

With the new funding, 

the team hopes to have 
this version of the project 
begin at the start of 2019, 
according to Boehman.

“The big thing is getting 

swift and effective launch 
of the project, and one of 
the things we’re working 
on right now is completing 
necessary paperwork for 
the launch of the project,” 
Boehman said. “We hope 
the project will officially 
be in place by Jan. 1.”

administration to demonstrate 
adequate cause for sanctions 
“in a hearing of record before 
an elected faculty body.” In 
an interview with The Daily 
on 
Wednesday, 
Tiede 
said 

the University had not yet 
responded to the letter.

“The reason I pointed to the 

severity of the punishment 
is 
that 
we 
do 
recognize 

that minor sanctions, such 
as a letter of reprimand, 
can be imposed without a 
full hearing. The ‘due’ part 
in due process is always 
relative to the severity of the 
punishment,” 
Tiede 
said. 

“But a major sanction, and 
what I was appealing to in 
the letter was that I think 
most people would consider 
being ineligible for a merit 
increase and ineligible for a 
sabbatical for some period of 
time to be not akin to a letter 
of reprimand but to have 
material consequences.”

The 
premise 
of 
the 

standards, Tiede said, was that 
faculty are “better qualified” 
than 
administrators 
to 

determine 
“whether 
a 

particular action of a faculty 
member was a proper exercise 
of academic freedom or was 
not.”

In the open letter addressed 

to Cole, graduate students 
from the University expressed 

their support for Cheney-
Lippold and Peterson, writing 
the 
University’s 
response 

had 
also 
been 
politically 

motivated.

“The university president’s 

statement declares that ‘U-M 
strongly opposes a boycott of 
Israeli academic institutions, 
and 
no 
school, 
college, 

department or unit at our 
university endorses such a 
boycott,’” the letter read. “This 
is an explicitly political stance 
in support of the apartheid 
state of Israel and, therefore, 
cannot be considered neutral, 
but, 
rather, 
one 
wholly 

aimed at shutting down BDS 
activism 
on 
campus 
and, 

more generally, on silencing 
support of and solidarity with 
Palestinians.”

On Sept. 24, the Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University Affairs released 
a 
statement 
on 
faculty 

responsibilities 
with 

regard to writing letters of 
recommendation, referencing 
the AAUP’s Statement on 
Professional Ethics.

“Within 
the 
guidelines 

set forth by the American 
Association 
of 
University 

Professors, 
and 

‘demonstrate(ing) respect for 
students,’ faculty should let a 
student’s merit be the primary 
guide for determining how 
and whether to provide such 
a letter,” SACUA’s statement 
read.

In 
a 
public 
forum 
for 

regent 
candidates 
Monday, 

incumbent candidate Andrea 
Fischer Newman (R) said 
SACUA 
had 
condemned 

Cheney-Lippold. 
Michael 

Atzmon, a SACUA member 
in the audience, responded 
the statement was not a 
condemnation.

Writing 
on 
behalf 
of 

Peterson in a letter dated Oct. 
15, the American Political 
Science Association said the 
sanctions 
“raise 
questions 

of 
procedural 
fairness” 

due to the lack of clarity 
surrounding an instructor’s 
obligations to write a letter of 
recommendation.

“That the instructor we are 

concerned about is, in this case, 
also an early career graduate 
student 
only 
heightens 

our concerns that outsize 
sanctions may be imposed 
on one who could reasonably 
argue 
that 
the 
vague, 

unspecified, 
and 
changing 

norms 
regarding 
writing 

letters 
of 
recommendation 

were not adequately conveyed 
in advance,” the letter read.

On 
Oct. 
9, 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

and Provost Martin Philbert 
published 
an 
open 
letter 

to the campus announcing 
the creation of a panel to 
“examine 
the 
intersection 

between political thought/
ideology and faculty members’ 
responsibilities to students,” 
and “make absolutely clear 
that 
faculty 
members’ 

personal 
political 
beliefs 

cannot interfere with their 
obligations to our students.”

The letter from the APSA 

also expressed the concern 
that the sanctions “give at least 
the appearance of pressuring 
instructors to conform to 
the university’s position on 
what the university has itself 
termed not only an issue of 
university values but also a 
matter of political belief.”

The letter defended Cheney-

Lippold’s 
participation 
in 

the academic boycott on the 
grounds that the opportunity 
to study at Israeli universities 
is not equally accessible to all 
students in the United States. 
The letter specifically noted 
the case of Lara Alqasem, who 
was detained at Ben-Gurion 
Airport for 15 days on her 
way to study at the Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem on a 
student visa because of her 
former position as president 
of the University of Florida’s 
chapter of Students for Justice 
in Palestine, which is a part of 
the Boycott, Divestment, and 
Sanctions movement.

“Given 
the 
unequal 

opportunities to study abroad 
in Israel - which in many 
ways violates the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
own 
Non-

Discrimination Policy - the 
decision to not recommend 
a student to such a program 
is not only legitimate, but far 
from punishable,” the letter 
read.

IDEOLOGY

T

he line “If voting could 
change 
anything 
it 
would be made illegal!” 
is 
often 
misattributed 
to 
Mark Twain, and disputably 
attributed to anarchist Emma 
Goldman. The first confirmed 
appearance, if it matters, was 
from The Lowell Sun in 1974. 
Regardless of who said it, the 
phrase 
carries 
a 
sentiment 
shared by many Americans: Why 
bother voting if it doesn’t seem 
to affect anything?
Of course, one vote does have 
some effect — collect enough of 
them for one candidate or one 
party and a number of things 
change on the surface. In reality, 
however, policy is implemented 
differently, stalled or walked 
back; judges are confirmed or 
blocked; districts (in census 
years) are drawn to increase or 
diminish the power of certain 
voting blocs. These things feel 
less and less like the sort of 
change Americans across the 
political spectrum are seeking. 
It seems Americans increasingly 
identify with Julius Nyerere’s 
quip: “The United States is also a 
one-party state but, with typical 
American extravagance, they 
have two of them.”
I’d point out that in a lot of 
ways, “they” are making voting 
illegal — especially in Michigan. 
Laws requiring addresses on 
photo identification to match 
voter 
registration 
addresses 
specifically 
target 
college 
students. 
Laws 
revoking 
franchise from felons prevent 
citizens — disproportionately 
nonwhite — from reintegrating 
with and participating in society 
and the closure of polling stations 
allow precise suppression of 
specific demographics. Straight-
ticket voting — choosing a 
party’s entire slate of candidates 
with 
a 
single 
notation 
— 
can 
furthermore 
increase 
participation in down ballot 
races; unsurprisingly, it’s only 
legal in eight states.
On an individual level, voting 
doesn’t actually matter — hence 
all of the ink spilled over the 
paradox of voting. It’s also 
surprisingly controversial to say 

nonvoting is a valid affirmative 
choice as a statement of lack of 
faith in the electoral process, 
the party system and the people 
who make it onto the ballot. 
I do recognize, however, that 
many nonvoters aren’t choosing 
to protest, but rather are being 
intentionally alienated from the 
process.
The 
view 
that 
voter 
suppression — not voter apathy — 
is an issue seems to be catching 
on, surprisingly. There was a 
significant amount of petulant 
backlash in the aftermath of 
Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss, as 
liberals vented frustration at 
nonvoters, saying, “If only they’d 
voted with us, we’d have won.” 
In the intervening years, this 
vague outrage has coalesced into 
a project that might have some 
genuine effect and target an 
actual problem.
Corporations 
are 
signing 
on to voter turnout projects: 
everything 
from 
registration 
to transport and time off. It’s 
been hard to miss the online 
promotions, too, especially on 
Voter Registration Day (Sept. 
25). It seemed as if every social 
media site — Reddit, Twitter, 
Discord, Tumblr — was running 
a banner ad reminding their users 
to vote or providing information 
about how to register. This level 
of interest from the business 
world is hard to understate — for 
whatever reason, corporations 
from Patagonia to Uber agree 
on the desirability of turning 
people out for the November 
2018 midterms and are willing to 
spend money making it happen.
Many 
appeals 
to 
student 
voters especially rely on outrage: 
voice your distaste for Donald 
Trump, support marginalized 
people and enjoy the twilight 
years of democracy. I’ve been 
slowly convinced, despite deeply 
held assumptions to the contrary, 
that these negative appeals work 
— most people don’t actually 
need a revolution, and they 
don’t need a charismatic leader 
to rally around. A (debated) rise 
in negative polarization means 
for many partisans, spite is 
sufficient.

Voter registration drives and 
mobilization efforts, therefore, 
could just be a response to 
this shift; instead of inspiring 
people to vote against all odds, 
concerned parties are guiding 
frustration. Once nudged in the 
right direction, social media and 
news outlets provide momentum 
— 
a 
party 
or 
politician’s 
responsibility is then simply 
to ensure fewer people hate 
them than their opponent. The 
interesting part is, whether out 
of love or spite, we’re voting.
Innumerable column inches 
have been wasted wringing our 
hands over whether people are 
going to vote for the “right” or 
“wrong” reasons, missing the 
fact that suddenly more of them 
are voting, exactly as people 
have been hoping for so many 
years. It’s strange to yearn for 
the masses to have their say 
when they refuse to participate 
and then suddenly recoil when 
they step forward.
The GOP understands this 
dynamic (as usual) much more 
intuitively than Democrats do 
— suppress the other party’s 
voters, tailor registration laws 
to your constituency and reap 
the 
electoral 
reward. 
The 
Democratic mistake is looking at 
this as if it’s somehow distasteful 
— the Republicans are winning, 
but they’re doing it “the wrong 
way.” The GOP understands, 
though, that whether they lose 
out of incompetence or out of 
principle the outcome is the 
same, and they’d prefer to win.
Encouraging 
electoral 
participation is a worthwhile 
project, even if the motives of 
certain actors are questionable. 
That said, increasing turnout 
isn’t 
a 
long-term 
strategy. 
Harnessing frustration at Trump 
works right now, but it won’t 
work forever. Legislators with 
sufficient motivation will move 
to cement their institutional 
advantages, and those pining 
for a mythical era of civility and 
pure intentions will continue to 
endure losing elections.

F

or the most part, my two 
best friends and I are just 
like any ordinary group of 
American girlfriends. 
We frequent Chipotle, 
binge episodes of “Curb 
Your Enthusiasm” and 
endlessly 
trash-talk 
people from our high 
school. But aside from 
providing me company 
when I spontaneously 
feel like going to Petco 
to look at the hamsters, 
Anjali and Nithya have 
also 
broadened 
my 
mind in ways atypical of most 
friendships.
My two best friends and I are 
all people of color. I am Chinese-
American, and Anj and Nith are 
both Indian-American, but our 
identities manifest themselves in 
very different ways. I, like many 
people of color, tend to tuck 
my cultural identity away. For 
most of my life, I have lived by 
the philosophy that chopsticks 
were only for family dinner and 
Chinese was only to be spoken 
at home. Whether it was out of 
shame or fear of ostracization, 
I did everything in my power 
to appear as acclimated to 
American society as possible.
Anj and Nith, on the other 
hand, are shamelessly proud 
Brown girls. They are outwardly 
obsessed with Indian comedian 
Hasan Minhaj and regularly 
listen 
to 
Bollywood 
Spotify 
playlists in the car. It is because 
of their unabashed pride that 
I have a better understanding 
of Indian culture than I ever 
thought possible.
When I walk into Anjali’s 
house, one of the first things I 
lay eyes on is an elderly woman 
dressed in a sari speaking 
Gujarati. 
This 
is 
Anjali’s 
grandmother. Naturally, I was a 
little jarred the first time I saw 
her sitting on the living room 
couch browsing on her iPad. It 
wasn’t every day I witnessed 
people 
casually 
wearing 
traditional Indian garb, but I 
very quickly realized for many 
people, including Anj, it was.
This initial recognition of my 
own biases was paramount to 

my eventual recognition of the 
beauty in foreign cultures. It is 
easy to claim open-mindedness, 
but 
the 
truth 
is 
everyone is subject 
to 
some 
form 
of 
internalized 
racism. We are all 
accustomed to our 
own ways of life, so 
when we encounter 
something unusual 
we naturally react 
in shock. But the 
sooner 
we 
can 
acknowledge 
this 
human tendency, the sooner we 
can learn to appreciate cultures 
and livelihoods unlike our own.
Anj and Nith have since 
exposed me to countless facets 
of Indian culture, perhaps most 
notably the region’s extensive 
and delicious cuisine. As a 1 a.m. 
snack, we feast on Pop-Tarts 
and cold pav bhaji. When we 
want to eat out but don’t feel 
like paying, we head to Nithya’s 
family restaurant for roti and 
lamb biryani and wash it down 
with some rich mango lassi. I 
don’t always like everything, 
and, admittedly, sometimes my 
spice tolerance proves to be 
a limiting factor, but because 
of my friends’ willingness to 
share their culture with me, I 
have discovered Indian cuisine 
stretches miles past just naan 
and curry.
Apart from the food, my 
friends have also been a window 
to various Indian traditions 
and customs. For Navaratri, 
a 10-day long Indian festival, 
we attended a local gathering 
where I learned the basics of 
garba, a dance native to the 
Gujarat state. The event was a 
spectacle. We dressed in vibrant 
southeast 
Asian 
attire 
and 
repeated intricate steps around 
a 
decorative 
centerpiece. 
Amid a crowd of Indians all 
moving 
in 
synchronization, 
my uncoordinated bare feet 
and lack of rhythm stood out 
like a sore thumb. Despite the 
clumsiness, 
my 
experience 
with garba was a fascinating 
cultural 
immersion 
only 
made possible by my friends’ 

eagerness to share their own 
customs and traditions with an 
outsider.
My friends’ pride in their 
own 
heritage 
is 
radiating. 
Because of them, I find myself 
excited to see an Indian playing 
a 
traditionally 
white 
role 
on television. I find myself 
frustrated at the sight of subtle 
Indian cultural appropriation 
and 
microaggression. 
But 
beyond that, I also find myself 
recognizing these same things 
within my own culture.
Anjali and Nithya’s lively 
backgrounds have reminded 
me that my own background 
is fascinating and worth my 
attention. While it is easy to 
simply acclimate to American 
society, my experiences as a 
Chinese girl have left me with a 
unique and nuanced worldview. 
To allow this identity to simply 
fade away is to diminish the 
valuable and oftentimes hard-
earned perspective that came 
with it. I used to brush my 
Chinese identity under the 
carpet, and to some extent I still 
do, but today I feel honored to 
be a part of a culture with such 
vibrant history and tradition.
Cultural exchange is a two-
sided 
matter. 
It 
obviously 
requires open-mindedness to 
work, but it is also not possible 
without 
people 
like 
Anjali 
and Nithya — people who take 
personal pride in where they 
come from and want others 
to know about it. For many of 
us, our cultural identities are 
not salient when they really 
should be. We acclimate so 
staunchly to our surroundings 
that we end up sacrificing 
some of our most interesting 
qualities in the process. This 
trend is counterproductive. We 
should take pride in where we 
come from not only because 
it makes our own lives more 
interesting, but also because 
the resulting cultural exchange 
and 
subsequent 
acceptance 
that makes us all better people.

E

very 
year, 
the 
University of Michigan 
proudly welcomes in 
close to 6,000 young 
new students, full of 
hope and excitement 
about 
this 
new 
chapter 
of 
their 
lives. It is true that 
college is a great 
time for so many 
young people, and 
some 
will 
always 
remember it as the 
“best years of their 
life,” yet college is 
undoubtedly a hard time when 
it comes to learning the big 
lessons of life. For so many 
of us, it is our first taste of 
true independence. We must 
learn to function on our own 
as 
adults. 
The 
University 
tries to incorporate teaching 
moments on the macro level 
through first year seminars 
on diversity and inclusion, 
and on the micro level in the 
classroom, as students get 
their first real taste of having 
to be accountable on their own 
for class attendance and time 
management.
However, there are still 
some big areas of adult life 
that take many freshmen much 
longer to grasp. It is striking to 
see how many students don’t 
say “excuse me” when they 
run past you on the street, 
don’t hold the door for you 
on the way into a coffee shop 
and don’t clean up their mess 
at restaurants or in the dining 
halls, especially in the first few 
months of a new school year. It 
seems many students of this 
generation, upon coming to 
college for the first time, lack 
an awareness of those around 
them and therefore an ability 
to be kind and empathetic.
I see this most prevalently 
as a dining hall worker. For the 
past three years, I have worked 
at Mary Markley Residence 
Hall’s dining hall, used mostly 
by freshmen. It is shocking 
how many students will simply 
throw used napkins on the 
ground, spill drinks on tables 
and floors without cleaning 
them up or ignore signs asking 
them not to remove dishes from 
the dining hall. Additionally, 
many treat the dining hall 
employees 
with 
a 
“Regina 
George” sort of mockery; as if 
we are all Cinderella and they 

are the step-sisters. They wait 
impatiently for food, engage in 
pointing and laughter as you 
walk by carrying a 
cleaning bucket and 
rag and often leave 
plates and cups on 
the tables assuming 
it is your job to clean 
them up.
While 
this 
can 
often seem blatantly 
rude and sometimes 
malicious, 
what 
I 
have learned is most 
of these freshmen 
just simply aren’t aware of 
how their actions affect, not 
only the dining hall employees 
,but the overall dining hall 
environment. It seems they 
truly 
don’t 
consider 
the 
students who will be coming 
in after them to eat or the 
employees — fellow students 
— who will end up staying late 
to clean up their unnecessary 
messes.
It is important to note not 
all students are like this. There 
are many kind and courteous 
students I meet every day, yet 
the proportion of students 
who are not is still too large. I 
have thought a lot about what 
contributing factors may have 
led to this cluelessness and one 
thing stands out to me: There 
is no one here to clean up after 
them anymore.
It’s true some of us did our 
fair share of chores and cleaned 
up after ourselves in high 
school, but a harsh reality is 
there are many very privileged 
students on this campus who 
may never have had to do such 
things. While some of us had 
jobs since we were 16, others 
have yet to work. This leaves 
them with a disconnect when 
it comes to understanding the 
frustrations of being a public 
service worker.
While I know some people 
who view the more privileged 
on this campus with a sort of 
contempt or bitterness, that 
is not how I feel. Instead, I 
feel some of us, due to life’s 
circumstances, simply learn 
some adult lessons earlier. As 
a waitress in high school, I 
learned to gather up my dishes 
and mess into one spot on a 
table to make it easier for the 
busser cleaning it up. My dad is 
50 years old but never worked 
as a waiter. If it weren’t for 

my mother and me, I doubt 
he’d ever collect his dishes in 
such a way. The truth is that 
learning these lessons often 
has very little to do with 
age by itself, but more to do 
with an openness to learning 
and finding compassion for 
people and places one doesn’t 
understand as well. It is never 
too late to start taking into 
consideration how to be kind 
toward those serving us.
One simple thing to keep 
in mind is most of the people 
serving you here in the dining 
halls, restaurants and cafes 
are other students! We are 
students who have to work one 
or maybe even two jobs to pay 
for rent and groceries in order 
to be able to afford attending 
school here. If that is not the 
reality for you, there is no need 
to feel ashamed, but maybe 
you do need to consider how 
you could be more courteous 
toward these other students. 
Something as simple as picking 
up a napkin and throwing it in 
the correct trash bin can go a 
long way. While you may not 
think your one napkin makes 
that much of a mess, if one 
hundred other students think 
the same thing this becomes a 
10- to 15-minute extra closing 
task for a dining hall worker 
who still has to go home and 
do homework like you.
The simple truth is, as a 
freshman, it is very mature to 
understand and be OK with 
the knowledge that you have 
a lot to learn about being a 
courteous adult. You are going 
to overlook some things in the 
struggle to acclimate to your 
new 
environment, 
but 
the 
more time you take to notice 
the people around you each 
day, the more you will find 
yourself willing and able to 
take the extra step of kindness 
and courtesy toward a stranger 
— whether it is holding the 
door, cleaning up your mess 
or simply saying “excuse me” 
when you pass someone on 
the sidewalk. These are all big 
steps toward becoming a fully 
functioning and aware adult 
in today’s busy world because, 
the truth is, you are not a child 
anymore.

FILM NOTEBOOK

Horror 
has 
always 
been 
a 
genre 
of 
extremes. 
It’s 
something of a self-fulfilling 
prophecy; 
it’s 
difficult 
to 
evoke fear from that which is 
familiar, so horror filmmakers 
find themselves locked in a 
never-ending search for the 
bloodiest, 
the 
goriest 
and 
the scariest. This proverbial 
arms race has led the genre to 
feel a bit oversaturated, with 
many horror films prioritizing 
shock value over quality and 
depth. It’s no slight against 
these films, as they certainly 
have their place in the popular 
entertainment canon, but one 
couldn’t be faulted for hoping 
for an alternative. Enter David 
Lynch.
Lynch 
is 
horror’s 
Andy 
Warhol: 
an 
enigmatic, 
white-haired 
virtuoso 
with 
a penchant for the bizarre. 
Operating on the fringe is 
Lynch’s 
modus 
operandi, 
originally making a name for 
himself on the midnight movie 
circuit that gained cult fame 
in the ’70s. These screenings, 
which started as a place for 
low-budget genre films, would 
eventually become a hotbed for 
some of cinema’s most bizarre 
and inventive films that would 
have never been funded by a 
major studio. Lynch produced 
his directorial debut, 1977’s 
“Eraserhead,” during his time 
studying at the American Film 
Institute, and would go on to 
blow up the midnight circuit, 
running for 99 consecutive 
weeks. 
The film tells the story of 
Henry 
(Jack 
Nance, 
“Lost 
Highway”), 
a 
young 
man 
whose one-night stand leaves 

him forced to raise a grossly 
deformed baby in a hyper-
industrial 
urban 
hellscape. 
It’s not only one of Lynch’s 
most iconic and recognizable 
films, but also a quintessential 
example 
of 
Lynch’s 
iconic 
horror 
style. 
Watch 
“Eraserhead” and you’ll find no 
jump scares, no dissonant string 
quartet; that’s just not Lynch’s 
style, which recognizes fear as 
a deep, complex emotion that 

deserves exploration beyond 
just cheap tricks and gotcha 
moments. 
In 
“Eraserhead”’s 
runtime, audiences are treated 
to a factory that turns brains 
into erasers, a cabaret girl with 
severe facial deformities and a 
limbless, lizard-like baby that 
cries 24/7. 
Most 
horror 
movies 
tell 
stories about scary situations 
happening 
in 
our 
world. 
They’re 
meant 
to 
leave 
audiences with that nagging 
thought 
that 
maybe, 
just 
maybe, this could happen to 
them. Lynch, however, defies 
this convention entirely. The 
world of “Eraserhead” is like 
our world gone insane; Lynch 

isn’t trying to scare you so 
much as he’s trying to make 
you extremely uncomfortable. 
Lynch’s 
cinematography 
purposely defies the typical 
“rhythm” of horror movies, 
forgoing 
the 
short, 
jumpy 
shots meant to build suspense. 
Rather, Lynch’s camera lingers 
on characters as they twitch 
and convulse, often in silence. 
There’s a realness to this style, 
and as a result, “Eraserhead” 
feel 
less 
like 
watching 
a 
scary movie and more like 
accidentally stumbling through 
a portal into a hellish alternate 
reality. 
Lynchian horror is effective 
because 
it 
toys 
with 
our 
expectations. It is at once 
both 
disturbingly 
bizarre 
and 
uncannily 
familiar. 
This dissonance is powerful 
and can make Lynch’s films 
viscerally difficult to watch. 
Lynch’s films upset the most 
basal part of us, the part that 
has observed an order and 
wants to see that order upheld. 
Lynch’s films take this order 
and warp it into deformity; the 
worlds his film occupies are 
like ours gone horribly wrong. 
While fans have long argued 
over Lynch’s messaging, he’s 
refused 
to 
ever 
comment 
publicly about the meaning of 
“Eraserhead,” leaving fans to 
find their own meaning in the 
insanity. Lynch’s penchant for 
secrecy expanded to his props, 
never revealing how he made 
“Eraserhead”’s deformed baby 
prop — even the actors and set 
crew had to close their eyes 
when he moved it onto the 
set. If you’re sick of the cheap 
tricks this Halloween and you 
want a ruin-your-life kind of 
horror experience, then look no 
further than the works of David 
Lynch.

Lynch is horror’s 

Andy Warhol: an 

enigmatic, white-

haired virtuoso 

with a penchant 

for the bizarre

For as long as I can remember, 
I’ve always loved scary movies. 
When I was a kid, they had a 
distinct and very physical effect on 
me. I would yell. I would toss away 
the blankets, horrified. I would 
jump off the couch and pray in a 
sort of knowing, mischievous way, 
that the boogie man would not get 
me. That feeling of unfiltered, pure 
fear was ambrosiac to me. It’s a 
kind of rawness I chase every time 
I see a movie. It’s why I’ve never 
stopped watching horror.
Nowadays, I pay attention 
to different aspects of horror 
movies, not the jump scares or the 
cheap tricks, but the narratives 
and what they may say about our 
understanding of fear. My favorites 
of the genre are the movies that 
meant one thing when I saw 
them in childhood and express 
a message entirely new when I 
watch them now. The truth is that, 
of the unhealthy heaps of horror 
I have seen, only one filmmaker 
consummately encapsulates the 
duality between my infantile 
adrenaline-seeking and my more 
mature reinspection: Wes Craven. 
Among the most successful 

horror 
directors, 
Craven 
has 
sustained 
his 
mordantly 
brooding impact in the popular 
consciousness because his work 
transcends any single era of horror. 
From his voyeuristic 1977 cult 
classic “The Hills Have Eyes” to 
his decade-defining “A Nightmare 
on Elm Street” seven years later 
to his cinematically reinventive 
“Scream” in the ’90s, the master 
of his craft has engendered a 
revitalized adoration for horror on 
a multigenerational scale.
Sure, on the surface, Wes 
Craven’s 
filmography 
is 
not 
astoundingly iconoclastic. At its 
core, it is a catalogue of slick grimy 
flicks with psychotic killers and 
(mostly) helpless victims awaiting 
their demises. And that’s not 
necessarily a bad thing.
I 
remember 
watching 
the 
opening scene of “Scream” when 
I was 10. At first, all I could do 
was stare wide-eyed in disbelief, 
an indignant refusal to accept 
the bloody insanity I was seeing. 
Looking back, however, it was 
among the first times my reaction 
to a movie was so involved, so 
intensely visceral. 
In hindsight, that is the first 
solid memory I have of a film — any 
film — leaping so violently out of 
the screen and urging me to reflect 

on the medium outside of simply 
watching it. 

It 
was 
a 
pretty 
scarring 
experience 
that 
I 
probably 
shouldn’t have had so young, but 
it also opened my mind to the 
capability of a movie, horror or not, 

Craven, master of horror

ANISH TAMHANEY
For the Daily

FILM NOTEBOOK

to pull a viewer in so completely.
There was always a layer of Wes 
Craven films that escaped me in 
my first viewings, even though I 
knew it was there, lurking in the 
background. 
I have, time and time again, 
revisited “Scream,” because, in 
myriad ways, it is an indictment 
of the genre itself — its lazy 
clichés, its predictability and its 
sanctimonious parables. On top 
of remaining the somewhat silly 
serial killer movie I’ve always 
cherished, the film is layered 
with metatextual messages in 
practically every line. 
Most memorable for me is 
when Jamie Kennedy is watching 
another horror film, “Halloween” 
and urging Jamie Lee Curtis 
to turn around. “Look behind 
you Jamie, look behind you,” he 
desperately mutters just as the 
very real killer looms behind him. 
A moment that had deeply 
frightened me as a kid had turned 
profoundly 
illuminating. 
This 
wasn’t just a scary movie; it was 
a scary movie that could speak 
volumes about the fallacies of its 

own genre. I often laugh at this 
scene now, not just because of the 
general ridiculousness of the movie 
but because the double-entendre is 
strikingly clever. 
Another gem of the series 
comes from “Scream 2,” in which 
a group of college students in film 
class debate at length about the 
validity of movie sequels. The 
conversation is endlessly hilarious 
because of its interactivity; we, 
as viewers, are forced to evaluate 
our own perceptions of second 
installments. Craven openly plays 
with our own expectations of the 
very movie we are seeing now. It’s 
brilliant.
And while it may be too 
generous to similarly laud the 
additional sequels the franchise, 
they too toy with our reality and its 
relationship to film, establishing 
a cartoonish mirror of our world 
in which the fictional “Stab” film 
series suffuses the fervor of horror 
fans.
Of course, it is impossible to 
discuss the ways in which Craven 
interacts with our reality without 
“A Nightmare on Elm Street,” the 

harrowingly astral gorefest that 
gave birth to an equally famous 
razor-handed antagonist: Freddy 
Krueger. 
His particular brand of evil 
always terrified me more than any 
other because he took advantage 
of a necessity of human behavior: 
sleep. How could I find comfort 
in turning off the TV and tucking 
myself in when I knew the movie’s 
dangers were never really gone?
There’s one line from “Scream” 
that embodies Craven, his outlook 
on cinema and his palpable reach: 
“It’s all a movie. It’s all one great 
big movie.”
The truth is that the source of 
my appreciation of Craven years 
ago and today is one and the same: 
His films are a reflection of my 
relationship with cinema. They 
offer this basic lesson regarding 
our involvement with the screen. 
The more you want out of a film, 
the more you will receive. 
With this realization in mind, 
I will never stop watching Wes 
Craven movies. They remind me 
and can remind all of us of the 
reason we turn on the TV at all. 

DIMENSION FILMS 

When I find myself in times 
of 
trouble, 
Rebecca 
Solnit 
comes to me. But her advice is 
never simply to let it be. Quite 
the opposite, the essays in her 
latest collection “Call Them By 
Their True Names: American 
Crises (and Essays)” encourage 
us to fight, in both word and 
action, against the forces of 
injustice, inequality and apathy 
that threaten the integrity of 
American society.

Solnit is perhaps best known 
for writing on feminism in her 
earlier essay collections “Men 
Explain Things to Me” and 
“The Mother of All Questions,” 
but after writing over 20 books 
and countless essays, Solnit 
proves an insightful observer 
in a diverse range of subjects, 
from environmental activism 
to the history of walking to the 
culture of San Francisco. The 
essays in “Call Them By Their 
True Names” are exemplary of 
Solnit’s omnivorous appetite, 
and her ability to weave her own 
obsessions into a vibrant and 
complex image of American life.
In the both grossly and 
charmingly 
titled 
“Armpit 
Wax,” Solnit meditates on how 
the creation myths of different 
cultures tint the lens through 
which we consider questions 
of 
perfection, 
grace 
and 
redemption; in the more somber 
“Death by Gentrification,” Solnit 
does a deep forensic dive into 

the 2014 police killing of Alex 
Nieto to explore how it reflects 
on larger issues of displacement 
and 
inequity 
in 
rapidly 
gentrifying 
San 
Francisco 
neighborhoods; in “The Ideology 
of Isolation,” Solnit connects 
the American “cowboy ethos” 
of 
rough-and-tumble 
self-
sufficiency to the disintegration 
of objective truth. Somewhere 
in 
this 
nimble 
navigation 
between the historical and the 
contemporary, the philosophical 
and the concrete, Solnit offers 
a 
remarkably 
clear-eyed 
understanding 
of 
American 
society, and pulls off the neat 
trick of untangling some wildly 
complicated 
issues 
into 
a 
comprehensible form without 
ever denying their complexity.
Tying together the disparate 
subjects of these essays is 
Solnit’s interest in the power of 
language, both as a diagnostic 
tool for larger social issues 
and a weapon by which those 
issues can be obscured or 
distorted in the public eye, 
which she identifies as “one 
of the crises of this moment.” 
Though Solnit doesn’t shy away 
from the cerebral and abstract, 
her interest in language is 
deeply practical, coming from 
her history as a progressive 
activist. She writes, “Calling 
things by their true names cuts 
through the lies that excuse, 
buffer, 
muddle, 
disguise, 
avoid or encourage inaction, 
indifference, obliviousness. It’s 
not all there is to changing the 
world, but it’s a key step.”
And “changing the world,” as 
grand a claim as that may seem, is 
the explicit goal of these essays. 
While that may seem naive to 
some, Solnit argues that it’s 
absolutely essential in her essay 
on “Naive Cynicism,” which she 
defines as the attitude that the 
world cannot be transformed 
in any substantial or ideal way, 
and therefore there’s no point 
in trying. Solnit argues that we 
must meet naive cynicism with 
practical idealism in the form 
of action: “What we do begins 
with what we believe we can do. 
It begins with being open to the 
possibilities and interested in 

the complexities.”
This 
prevailing 
emphasis 
on hope, even in the face of 
seemingly 
insurmountable 
obstacles, 
makes 
Solnit 
a 
steady and necessary voice of 
the resistance. While her own 
values 
lie 
unapologetically 
on the far-left of the political 
spectrum, her mission applies 

to anyone seeking a more just, 
more progressive social order, 
with a grounding in evidence-
based reform. In a time when 
every week seems to bring a new 
defeat for minorities, for women 
and for the environment, Solnit 
reminds us that our actions 
matter even when they seem 
trivial.
“Actions 
often 
ripple 
far 
beyond 
their 
immediate 
objective, and remembering this 
is a reason to live by principle 
and act in the hope that what you 
do matters, even when results 
are unlikely to be immediate or 
obvious … You do what you can 
do; you do your best; what what 
you do does is not up to you.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE PROFILE

I would be lying if I did not 
say that at first, I felt intimidated 
about the notion of meeting 
Thomas Laub, a Senior pursuing 
a 
BFA 
in 
Musical 
Theatre 
and a minor in Ross School 
of Business, to speak about 
his new production company, 
Runyonland 
Productions. 
Runyonland 
Productions 
has 
been extremely successful since it 
first took off. Its first production, 
“SHEL,” written by University 
graduate Noah Kieserman, who 
stars as Evan in the “Dear Evan 
Hansen” National Tour, sold out 
in just three hours. “SHEL” will 
do its first industry reading in 
New York City during the month 
of May. When speaking with 
Laub, it soon became apparent 
that he was a humble young man, 
who is trying to ignite change 
in the theatre industry that he 
wants to see.
“I wanted to produce live 

theatre and so I worked with 
Disney 
theatrical 
group 
on 
Broadway, 
and 
during 
that 
summer I was sitting in my little 
box on 136th and Broadway, and I 
was thinking: ‘I don’t know what 
the point of doing this is if I’m 
not doing this with my friends 
and cultivating our own creative 
cohort’,” Laub stated, speaking 
to his experience on starting a 
production company.
From 
there, 
Laub 
gave 
Kieserman a call about producing 
his original musical; the company 
and “SHEL” took off from there.
Laub takes advantage of the 
diversity of talent hosted on 
campus. He recruits Engineering 
students for stage, scenic design 
and lighting, benefits from the 
incredible business and creative 
talent at Ross and uses his fellow 
cohort’s talents in SMTD to 
create large scale and small scale 
productions of high caliber.
“We exist to fill the space that 
isn’t currently filled on campus,” 
Laub said.
Runyonland 
Productions 
is 

not a student organization. In 
fact, it is a for-profit theatre 
production company that is 
a great and accessible way 
for students of all different 
backgrounds to do professional 
work in the theatre industry, 
with a company that has a direct 
pipeline to the booming theatre 
industry in New York.
The 
mission 
statement 
of 
Runyonland 
Production 
company is “to bring the best 
live theatrical entertainment 
to the widest, most diverse 
audience possible. Runyonland 
Productions 
aims 
to 
both 
enrich the community through 
producing 
Broadway-level 
artistic 
experiences 
and 
providing educational outlets 
for young artists and creators 
at the University of Michigan,” 
Laub said.
“If you want to do the best 
work you get the widest group of 
people. It seems obvious but it’s 
stunningly not … Growing up, 
I was told, ‘You’re into theatre: 
You should be a producer,’ and 

my equally smart, brilliant, 
talented female friends will be 
told, ‘You’re into theatre, you 
should be a stage manager.’”
If the production world were 
filled with Thomas Laubs, who 
appreciated and thrived for 
diversity in both casting and 
production, the world would be 
a better and more appreciative 
place. Women and people of 
color not only need to see their 
identities reflected on stage, 
but also in the creative and 
logistics part of live theatre.
Laub 
cultivates 
diversity 
in production to allow live 
theatre to reach new heights 
and see a brilliance that simply 
cannot be created by a team of 
solely old, white men. During 
his experience in a Broadway 
production office, Laub quickly 

noticed that meetings consisted 
of teams of this demographic, 
so he sought out to change that 
narrative.
Laub 
strives 
to 
make 
Runyonland 
Productions 
empower all different types of 
people into working in the theatre 
industry, to make art and theatre 
inclusive and unhindered. He 
knows the only way to create 
great art is by having everyone 
have a creative say in the industry. 
Runyonland Production aims to 
be an example of the change that 
needs to happen in the industry.

ISABELLE HASSLUND
Daily Arts Writer

After a momentary blip in the last 
decade, women in R&B have been 
making their long-awaited return 
to the charts. Following a fruitful 
’90s that brought in the success of 
powerhouses like Mariah Carey 
and Lauryn Hill, the prevalence of 
new artists began to wane in the 
late aughts into recent years. SZA, 
Janelle Monáe and Jorja Smith 
have received widespread critical 
acclaim for their works, but their 
commercial success wasn’t up to 
par. It’s for this reason Ella Mai’s 
newfound success with sleeper hit 

“Boo’d Up” came as a surprise, but 
not necessarily a shock: It’s been 
expected for some time now.
The song is nothing new: a 
throwback-esque jam that harkens 
back to the twinkly choruses and 
saccharine lyrics that have all been 
heard before. “Ooh, now I’ll never 
get over you until I find something 
new / That get me high like you 
do.” But the star ascends at a time 
infatuated with all things ’90s — 
it’s as nostalgic as comfort food. 
Her music may not be as sonically 
complex or compelling as those 
of her peers, but it’s an earworm 
catchy enough to get stuck in the 
heads of tweens and old-school 
rockers alike. Her debut eponymous 

album Ella Mai is no different.
The album, like Mai’s past 
EPs, is produced by none other 
than the infamous club anthem 
churner himself, DJ Mustard. 
No “Mustard on that beat, ho” 
signature this time around, but 
the album is full of others: trap-
flirting beats, simplistic synth-
bass openings, electronic snaps 
and claps, plinking keyboards. 
This is by no means a bad 
thing; it makes for the airy, 
finger-snapping appeal the 
album strives for. There are 
points, however, where the 
sound 
feels 
monotonous. 
“Everything,” a slow jam 
featuring John Legend, is a 
prominent example: the trap 
influenced chorus ill-fitting 
against Mai and Legend’s 
crooning and the adoring 
lyricism.
That being said, the album 

offers its intricacies elsewhere. 
The leading track, “Emotion,” 
takes charge in framing the 
album around an acrostic poem 
for Mai’s name via spoken word 
skits that last about 10 seconds 
every two to three tracks. The 
move leans juvenile but provides 
a deft showcase of Mai’s British 
accent, emotive lyricism and 
views on romance. Other points 
where Mai shines on the album 
include 
“Sauce,” 
her 
words 
scathing and vivid, informing 
her partner “You gotta level up 
if you want this (Stop) / Chewin’ 
with your mouth wide open.” 
The more vulnerable “Trip” is 
also worth mentioning, as she 
confesses “I put my feelings on 
safety / So I don’t go shootin’ 

where your heart be.”
Though centered on the idea 
of romantic love, Mai provides 
the story and personality that 
listeners have been waiting for 
since “Boo’d Up.” “Shot Clock” 
exudes confidence in its detailing 
of a confrontation between Mai 
and her lover, livid but assured as 
she demands to know whether 
or not what they have is serious. 
The doo-wop influence paired 
with an interpolation of Drake’s 
“Legend” heighten the already 
confrontational 
and 
sarcastic 
tone of the song. “Own It” adds a 
raunchy and fun element to the 
album. Mai eschews the more naïve 
air she paints for herself in other 
tracks by tapping into her more 
sensual side, her vocal range deeper 

amid the sampled Adina Howard. 
Conversely, bonus track “Naked” 
carries immense emotional weight 
as it explores experiences beyond 
the physical, Mai insecure as to 
whether or not she can convey her 
truest self to another. The track 
stands as the album’s sole slow song, 
stripped-down and strummed on 
an acoustic guitar.
By no means groundbreaking, 
Ella Mai provides a quick fix of 
nostalgia for the R&B sound many 
of us grew up to. If you’re a fan of 
some of the newer sounds surfacing 
onto the R&B scene, perhaps this 
album isn’t for you. That being said, 
the charming and upbeat nature 
of Ella Mai is undeniable; she is 
bound for success that goes beyond 
capitalizing as a one-hit-wonder.

Ella Mai’s debut album is 
nothing new, easy to like

‘The Romanoffs’ misses the mark

TV REVIEW

The 
tragic 
story 
of 
the 
Romanoff family, and its youngest 
member Anastasia in particular, 
has captivated audiences since the 
earliest era of the silver screen. 

Matthew Weiner, the creator of 
the widely praised series “Mad 
Men,” is the latest to take a stab 
at the story. The result is an 
anthology collection that shares 
“Mad Men”’s stylish flair but 
lacks the nuanced observations 
and character studies that made 
“Mad Men” memorable.
“The Violet Hour,” the first 
installation of the series, takes 
place in present day Paris. It 

centers around the estate of 
Anastasia LeCharnay (Marthe 
Keller, “The Escape”), an elderly, 
wealthy French woman who 
claims to be descended from the 
Romanoffs. Her nephew Greg 
(Aaron 
Eckhart, 
“Incarnate”) 
and his girlfriend Sophie (Louise 
Bourgoin, “I am a Soldier”) are 
her closest remaining relatives, 
despite the fact that they spend 
most of the episode waiting 
for her death and the resulting 
inheritance. Anastasia — who 
mostly goes by the diminutive 
Anushka 
— 
loathes 
her 
caretakers, especially the newest 
one Hajar (Inès Melab, “The 
Bird”), a young Frenchwoman of 
North African descent.
Anushka is cruel and uncouth 
towards Hajar, calling her a 
“terrorist” and citing events 
throughout 
history 
where 
“Western Civilization” defeated 
the 
“Muslim 
World.” 
She 
initially uses her family name 
and heritage as a symbol of 
“Western 
Civilization” 
itself, 
using it to constantly insult 

Hajar. While her tirades become 
rather uncomfortable to watch, 
it is even more disconcerting 
to somehow suggest that Hajar 
should sympathize with Anushka 
due to her clear isolation. The 
eventual thawing of relations 
never seems to feel quite natural. 
“The Violet Hour” is ostensibly 
an examination of power and its 
loss, but by using simple clichés 
such as a yellow Faberge egg and 
convoluted history lessons, the 
episode never gets its point across 
in a compelling way.
The 
episode 
fleetingly 
tackles other social topics as 
well, including the shrinking 
of the French middle class and 
the immigrant experience as a 
whole, but each discussion and 
exploration 
feels 
annoyingly 
superficial. 
Anushka 
is 
the 
only 
well-developed, 
fleshed-
out 
character, 
leaving 
the 
rest to serve as mere props. 
While Hajar is portrayed as 
sympathetic, Melab is not given 
the opportunity to show much 
range beyond her mildly annoyed 

reactions 
towards 
Anushka’s 
racial epithets. Moreover, her 
family’s story is not given much 
thought, despite the potential 
comparisons with Anushka’s own 
background.
What “The Violet Hour” — 
and “The Romanoffs” as a whole 
— lacks in effective storytelling, 
it makes up for in the visuals. 
Anushka’s gilded Paris mansion 
is both stunningly beautiful yet 
hauntingly empty, giving better 
context for her misery than her 
own speeches. The shots are 
always controlled and varied, 
in typical Weiner style. Scenes 
featuring Anushka fittingly give 
the sense that despite her family’s 
wealth, she is little more than a 
petty, vindictive miser who is out-
of-touch with modern France.
Perhaps due to its length, “The 
Violet Hour” never satisfyingly 
completes 
the 
discussions 
it 
brings up. While a beautiful 
watch, it straddles the line 
between “good” and “great,” 
lacking the subtlety to edge it 
towards the latter.

Too skilled to sit, Brazdeikis to learn multiple positions

Ignas Brazdeikis is officially 
listed as a forward. Don’t let 
that fool you.
The top-40 prospect, who 
headlines the men’s basketball 
team’s 12th-ranked recruiting 
classes, per 247Sports’ compos-
ite score, is firmly behind red-
shirt junior Charles Matthews 
at small forward. That’s more 
a product of Matthews’ abil-
ity as a scorer and anchor for 
a defense that ranked third in 
adjusted efficiency last season. 
But Brazdeikis’ talent is enough 
to warrant some unorthodox 
moves.
“We gotta get him out on the 
court somehow,” Beilein said 
last week at Big Ten Media Day.
Doing so means also playing 
Brazdeikis at shooting guard 
and power forward, forcing the 
freshman to learn multiple posi-
tions in Beilein’s notoriously 
complex system. Since coaching 
in Division I, it’s the third time 
Beilein has done that. The last 
was with Johannes Herber, who 
played under Beilein at West 
Virginia from 2003-06; the first 
was with Scott Ungerer, who 
was under Beilein’s tutelage 
from 1998-2002 at Richmond 
and who, like Brazdeikis, is list-
ed as 6-foot-7.
For Ungerer, too, playing 
multiple positions as a fresh-
man 
was 
as 
much 
a 
result 
of necessity as 
versatility. 
The 
Spiders suffered 
so many injuries 
that 
Ungerer, 
a 
point 
guard 
in high school, 
had to play cen-
ter in a game at 
UConn.
“I’ll 
prob-
ably jump to a conclusion with 
Ignas,” Ungerer told The Daily 
in a phone interview. “You’ve 
gotta have somebody who’s 
smart enough, especially in 

(Beilein’s) system, to be able 
to pick up and play multiple 
positions. Because there is a 
pretty 
significant 
difference 
in Beilein’s two-guard offense 
between 
the 
guard and the 
forward and the 
center.
“Those 
are 
the three pivot 
spots. So you’ve 
gotta have some-
body who’s adept 
and kind of com-
fortable, and can 
have 
a 
pretty 
quick, 
high-
learning agility to pick up the 
different motions.”
Being 
the 
4-man 
means 
playing on the wing. Often, in 
Beilein’s offense, it means get-

ting the entry pass as opposed to 
the shooting guard, who splits 
the responsibility of bringing 
the ball up.
It’s a little more compli-
cated than that, 
though.
“The offense, 
a lot of it, is 
predicated based 
on motion and 
movement,” 
Ungerer 
said. 
“So, 
some-
body 
makes 
one change and 
cuts 
backdoor, 
it changes the 
whole flow of the play. So I 
needed to know what everybody 
was doing from every position.”
The reads Brazdeikis will 
have to make, in other words, 

change drastically based on 
position. As much as his abil-
ity to slide between two posi-
tions depends on the physical 
— can he guard players across 
the 
spectrum 
without trouble? 
— the mental is 
just as impor-
tant.
“I 
wouldn’t 
do it if I didn’t 
think he could 
do it,” Beilein 
said. “... One day 
I’m gonna say, 
‘You’re a 4-man, 
you’ve 
gotta 
crash the boards on offense.’ 
And then I’m gonna tell (him), 
‘No, you gotta be back when 
you’re a 2-man.’ So there’s a lot 
of things. He’s gonna not be per-

fect at it, but he’s gonna grow 
as a player. He’s a guy that can 
handle this. His basketball IQ 
is good, and he picks up things 
quickly.”
Brazdeikis’ 
physical skill is 
already 
there, 
in droves. He’s 
older than most 
freshmen at 19 
and lit up the 
prep school cir-
cuit last season 
at 
Orangeville 
Prep in Ontar-
io, Canada. On 
Michigan’s trip 
to Spain in August, Brazdeikis 
averaged 15.7 points and 7.0 
rebounds in three games, lead-
ing the team in scoring, per 
stats compiled by The Athletic’s 

Brendan Quinn.
If you’re looking for a reason 
Beilein wants him on the court 
so badly, that’s it. Three exhibi-
tion games though they may be, 
if Brazdeikis can put up those 
numbers in that setting, hav-
ing been with the team for just 
weeks, think about what he can 
do with once fully integrated. 
Brazdeikis is a hamster running 
in a ball. He may need a little 
more structure, but the energy 
— and ability — he brings is pal-
pable.
“He’s such a good driver that 
he’ll pass up an open shot, or 
he’ll doubt whether he’s open 
because he knows, anytime, (he 
can) just get to the hoop in prior 
experiences,” Beilein said. “In 
the Big Ten, you ain’t getting to 
the hoop. So we gotta get him to 
be able to slow down, play with 
pace.”
It could take time for that 
slow-down to happen, Ungerer 
said, but Brazdeikis has a noted 
advantage in the Spain trip. 
Already, he has played live com-
petition against real opponents, 
albeit in an exhibition setting. 
And his performance was up to 
par.
Still, there may be kinks to 
work out early on. Miscommu-
nication could be a telltale sign, 
Ungerer said, that Brazdeikis is 
still learning to play within the 
system. Once he does, Brazdei-
kis may quickly become good 
enough for the 
next level.
“When (Braz-
deikis) has the 
ability to go to 
the NBA — I 
think 
he’s 
got 
a great shot of 
playing 
profes-
sional basketball 
— (that) they’re 
gonna 
want 
a 
guy 
that 
can 
play a lot of positions,” Beilein 
said. “A guy that can pass, can 
rebound, can shoot and can 
defend three or four positions. 
Iggy, I believe he can do that.”

Lockwood ready to help Michigan offense

Standing just outside the 
left circle, Will Lockwood 
waited to receive the puck 
from sophomore forward Josh 
Norris. Norris rifled a pass 
right to the junior forward’s 
stick, and Lockwood fired a 
shot that found twine.
With one flick of his stick, 
he halved the Michigan hockey 
team’s deficit in the first game 
of the season. And though the 
Wolverines would eventually 
fall to Vermont in that matchup, 
Lockwood’s goal mattered for a 
different reason.
It was his first goal in a 
Michigan sweater since 2017 
after suffering a season-ending 
shoulder injury in January 
2018.
“It was awesome,” Lockwood 
said of the goal. “Any time you 
get an opportunity to score in 
Yost and you end up putting one 
in, it’s an awesome experience. 
… To have that one go in was a 
good feeling.”
It was a long road from the 
initial injury to being ice-ready. 
Lockwood 
worked 
toward 
returning for the beginning 
of the 2018-19 season, nine 
months 
after 
undergoing 
surgery.
On April 15, just ten days 
after the Wolverines’ season 
ended with a loss to Notre 
Dame in the Frozen Four 
semifinal 
game, 
Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson tweeted a 
photo of Lockwood practicing 
on the ice at a darkened Yost 
Ice Arena — alone.
“I 
saw 
determination, 
focus,” Pearson said. “He really 
did a great job getting himself 
ready to play and making sure 
he was strong enough to go. He 
redefined his body … He really 
committed himself to making 
sure he could do everything he 
could to get himself ready for 
the season.”
After notching 11 points in 16 
games last season, Lockwood’s 
return to the ice promises to 
help the Michigan offense 
recover from the loss of last 
season’s three top scorers.
“It’s great having him back 

because it gives us so many 
more options to have a player 
like him, whether on your 
power play or penalty kill,” 
Pearson said. “He can play 
in all situations. He’s a good 
player, too, so you put him with 
other players and he lifts their 
game up, too. He’s got great 
individual skills, but he makes 
people around him better.”
Through their first game — 
plus two exhibition matchups 
— the Wolverines have scored 
12 goals and given up 15. And 
at the same point last season, 
through two games and one 
exhibition, 
Michigan 
had 
scored 13 goals and given 
up just five. While the goals 
scored differs very slightly, the 
goals against shows a glaring 
change.
And 
it’s 
that 
increased 
number of goals against — the 
sign of a struggling defense — 
that shows the real offensive 
issues for the Wolverines. The 

best defense is a good offense, 
and Michigan demonstrates 
that the adage is true.
“The best defense is to be 
playing in the offensive zone,” 
Lockwood said. “We’ve been 
working on that, and a lot of it 
is puck control and supporting 
each other.”
When a team has possession 
in the offensive zone and 
manages to score, the defense 
has to do little work. But 
when a team loses possession 
entering the offensive zone 
or leaving the defensive zone, 
the defense is suddenly on its 
heels attempting to prevent a 
goal. And while the role of the 
defense is to prevent the other 
team from scoring, a lack of 
offense makes that job harder.
“You get behind and then you 
start pressing,” Pearson said. 
“You do different things. Your 
style changes, it shouldn’t. … 
We’ve gotta make sure we take 
care of our defensive zone first. 

If you’re giving up four and 
five goals, you’re gonna have to 
score more, and that puts a lot 
of pressure on your forwards to 
do that.”
As 
one 
forward 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ top line, Lockwood 
stands in position to take on 
that pressure. 
And after sitting in the 
stands for Michigan’s trip to 
the Frozen Four, he’s ready 
to be back competing on the 
ice. With three points in the 
Wolverines’ first three games, 
Lockwood has settled back 
in as one of Michigan’s top 
scorers and has made it clear 
he won’t let opportunities pass 
him by this season.
“I felt like I was missing 
a little something in my life 
(when 
I 
wasn’t 
playing),” 
Lockwood said. “But to be back 
— it feels great to be on the ice 
every day. I have a different 
mindset. I don’t really take 
anything for granted.”

‘M’ sweeps road slate

Michigan volleyball coach 
Mark Rosen clinched his 400th 
career win with the Wolverines 
on Friday, after over 20 years in 
Ann Arbor.
More 
dear 
to 
Rosen 
was that he achieved this 
accomplishment alongside his 
wife, associate head coach Leisa 
Rosen.
No. 13 Michigan (17-2 overall, 
6-2 Big Ten) swept its weekend 
road tilts against rival Ohio 
State (12-8, 3-5) and Maryland 
(12-8, 3-5) in five and four sets, 
respectively.
On the road Friday in a hostile 
environment, the Wolverines 
jumped out to a two sets to 
none lead against the Buckeyes. 
But in a game with so much 
emotion, Ohio State did not go 
away easily, and countered by 
taking the next two sets behind 
a flurry of adjustments.
“Every team in the Big Ten 
is good,” Rosen said. “But it’s 
those teams that maybe don’t 
have as good a record and 
haven’t had as much success 
that I don’t want to say you look 
past, but it’s a little harder to 
prepare for them because on a 
given night, they can play really, 
really well.
“Ohio 
State 
made 
some 
pretty significant changes in 
their lineup and their tactics. 
They just did a great job of 
serving the ball aggressively 
and switching their blockers 
around so they could match up 
differently with our hitters. I 
just thought that they played 
really well and adjusted, and we 
had to make sure we adjusted to 
the their adjustments.”
That they did.
Although it dropped both 
the third and the fourth sets, 
Michigan remained confident 
in its gameplan and unleashed 
its not-so-secret weapon in the 
fifth set, senior outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt. She finished the 
match with 23 kills, tied for the 
team lead.
“In 
the 
fifth 
we 
really 
challenged her to be super 
aggressive and bang out of 

trouble,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“You 
know, when we’re in trouble, 
we tell her to just go after it, and 
don’t just try to keep the ball in 
play. Carly did a great job in the 
fifth set, and she was great all 
weekend.”
Equally 
great 
was 
Paige 
Jones, the freshman outside 
hitter from Ohio, about whom 
Rosen gushed.
“She was playing in her home 
state, against the big school in 
her state and she had her whole 
high school there, probably even 
her county was there,” Rosen 
said. “That’s a lot of pressure 
to have on you as an 18-year 
old freshman. And she played 
outstanding, and that tells you 
a lot about her fortitude and her 
makeup. She’s a kid who’s not 
afraid of those moments.”
As Rosen alluded to, the 
stage 
elevated 
Jones’ 
play. 
She finished the match with a 
career high 23 kills, which tied 
the veteran Skjodt for the team 
lead.
Coming off the rivalry game 
in Columbus though, Michigan 
had a hiccup in its first set 
against the Terrapins, and lost, 
25-19.
“Maryland came out and was 
serving the leather off of the 
ball.” Rosen said. “They were 
playing clean defense, they 
were great offensively and we 
just couldn’t get anything going.
“But that’s why we reset it 
and play best of five.”
And in an odd second set 
where the Wolverines won with 
just eight kills — around half 
their season average for kills-
per-set — they mentally reset. 
Michigan came out firing on all 
cylinders in the next two sets 
and never looked back en route 
to a four-set victory.
But 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
progress deeper into the season, 
Rosen knows more work is 
needed to tack onto his now 401 
wins.
“Since we’ve got some youth 
on the court,” Rosen said, “we’ve 
got to continue to develop those 
guys and progress to where, by 
the end of the year, six weeks 
from now, we’re playing our 
best volleyball.”

Warriner with different perspective on Saturday’s game

Saturday will be nothing new 
for Ed Warriner. 
In fact, there’s not much 
anymore 
that 
is 
new 
for 
Warriner. 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
line 
coach 
remembers 
coaching 
as a graduate assistant in the 
Michigan-Michigan 
State 
rivalry 
“30-something 
years 
ago.” 
Now he’s on the other side 
coaching 
a 
much-improved 
Michigan offensive line that 
just might hold the key to 
a win in East Lansing over 
the 24th-ranked Spartans on 
Saturday. 
“You 
never 
know 
how 
life’s going to take you in 
this journey,” Warriner said 
Wednesday 
afternoon. 
“You 
just do the best you can to keep 
moving.”
Warriner has done just that, 
reaching nearly every corner in 
the college football landscape 
on his winding path to Ann 
Arbor. Warriner has made stops 
at Army, Air Force, Kansas, 
Illinois, Notre Dame, Ohio State 
and Minnesota, in addition to 
his time at Michigan State in 
1985-86.
Then 
25, 
Warriner 
had 
already put pen to paper on 
an agreement to coach in high 
school when Michigan State 
approached him. He knew he 
wanted to be a college coach. 
And working with then-head 
coach George Perles and then-
assistant coach Nick Saban 
in East Lansing shortly after 
graduating college was an offer 
he couldn’t refuse. 
When Warriner speaks about 
his past, phrases like “learned 
a lot from” and “connected 
with” arise with frequency. The 
names of coaches and schools 
get tossed around at a rapid 
pace. He’s firmly intertwined 
in the complicated web that 
underlies college coaching. A 
football coach, through and 
through.

And with his laundry list 
of 
experience, 
Warriner 
approaches Saturday’s rivalry 
differently. Unlike others in the 
Michigan locker room, Warriner 
holds no such animosity toward 
the Spartans. In fact, Warriner 
remains friends 
with 
Michigan 
State 
coach 
Mark Dantonio, 
who he roomed 
with 
during 
their 
time 
together 
with 
the 
Spartans. 
His 
son 
is 
a 
freshman 
linebacker 
at 
Michigan State.
He speaks of Dantonio like 
one might speak of an old friend.
“We were just two guys who 
loved coaching football, loved 
the 
opportunity. 
We 
were 
learning. We were working 
together. So we enjoyed that 
time together — we hit it off 
and had a great relationship. 

And that’s carried through,” 
Warriner 
said. 
“Obviously 
our paths have gone different 
directions, so we don’t get to 
spend as much time together, 
but when we are together, it’s 
like we haven’t been apart.
“Obviously 
now that I work 
here, 
that’s 
going to change 
a 
little 
bit,” 
Warriner 
adds, 
remembering 
where he stands. 
“But as far as, is 
he a good man? 
He is a good 
man. And you 
respect him, you 
respect what he’s done.” 
He doesn’t forget that there’s 
a game Saturday, though. Quite 
a meaningful one, at that. 
He likes where his offensive 
line stands at the moment, 
noting it has accounted for 
just four penalties all season. 
It’s unquestionably the most 

improved unit on the team 
through seven games, a credit 
to Warriner’s diligence.
And Saturday is his unit’s 
biggest moment, a test against 
an aggressive team that always 
seems to turn up the physicality 
when it plays Michigan. He, like 
everyone else, looks forward 
to the challenge. Warriner’s 
laundry list of former employers 
doesn’t jade him to the moment. 
“They’re 
all 
the 
same, 
because they’re very important 
to the players on this team, to the 
alumni, to the former players,” 
Warriner said. “They’re all 
important. They’re important 
to us. We get the significance of 
them. It’s a privilege to be apart 
of a program that have these 
kind of rivalries. You turn it up 
a notch; that’s why you do this.
“These 
are 
the 
great 
opportunities, the fun games, 
the memories you have playing 
in these games, coaching in 
these games for me, stay with 
you a lifetime.”

Michigan offensive line coach Ed Warriner used to work with Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio in East Lansing.

“We were 
learning. We 
were working 
together.”

Wolverines, Metellus motivated by past mistakes

The Michigan football team 
owns the nation’s top-ranked 
pass defense yet again in 2018, 
allowing fewer than 130 yards 
per game. That showed last 
Saturday 
when 
Wisconsin 
quarterback Alex Hornibrook 
did not complete a pass during 
the second and third quarters 
of the Wolverines’ eventual 
blowout win.
It was as close as Michigan’s 
defense has come to perfection 
— the perpetual pursuit of 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown. In the same vein as 
Alabama coach Nick Saban, 
Brown always has something 
to critique, even when the 
Wolverines 
are 
dominant. 
Sometimes, that means going 
back a few weeks to remind 
players that they’re not perfect.
Such 
was 
the 
case 
in 
Michigan’s 
season-opening 
loss 
to 
Notre 
Dame. 
The 
Fighting Irish scored three 
first-half touchdowns behind 
quarterback Brandon Wimbush, 
who was aided by a litany of 
the Wolverines’ penalties and 
mistakes on third down.
Safeties coach and special 
teams 
coordinator 
Chris 
Partridge reminds his group 
about those first-game gaffes 
frequently. 
“Shoot,” 
Patridge 
said 
during 
Wednesday’s 
press 
conference. 
“I 
like to show my 
guys clips from 
that game every 
week 
just 
to 
make sure they 
stay 
grounded 
and understand 
that, if they don’t prepare the 
right way and they don’t play 
the right way, anything can 
happen.”
Much has been made about 
the improvement in Michigan’s 
offensive line since that loss in 
South Bend. But the secondary 
has 
also 
flashed 
signs 
of 
growth. Penalties are down. 
Interceptions are up. Mistakes 

have been mitigated. 
“We’ve made a huge step after 
the Notre Dame game because 
we got bombed on a few times 
that game,” said sophomore 
cornerback 
Ambry 
Thomas. 
“And (the coaching staff has) 
been hard on us ever since. They 
haven’t let up yet.
“They’re more 
interactive, 
more vocal, more 
everything. 
They’re 
on 
the field really 
showing us what 
to do.”
Partridge sees 
a 
connection 
between 
that 
increase 
in 
intensity and the 
play of perhaps the Wolverines’ 
most-improved defensive player, 
Josh Metellus. The junior safety 
had a difficult start to the season 
— he was ejected for targeting 
during the second drive of the 
Notre Dame contest. He and 
fellow 
safety, 
senior 
Tyree 
Kinnel, 
were 
also 
exposed 
occasionally against the slant-
heavy offenses of SMU and 

Northwestern. 
But 
while 
Metellus 
isn’t 
flawless, he has become more 
of a play-maker for Michigan’s 
defense with a team-high three 
interceptions.
“He’s playing at a high level,” 
Patridge said. “He’s practicing 
at a high level, that’s why he’s 
playing 
at 
a 
high level. He 
is 
seeing 
the 
game 
really 
well. He’s seeing 
how we’re going 
to be attacked 
really well back 
there. 
He’s 
taken command, 
become 
more 
vocal 
and 
is 
finishing plays.”
Metellus 
was 
named 
the 
team’s defensive player of the 
week Monday after collecting 
an interception and five tackles 
against the Badgers.
“His 
best 
game 
as 
a 
Wolverine,” said Jim Harbaugh 
on Monday. “And he seems to 
be a solid tackler, good coverage 
safety. Great to see him get his 
hands on the ball with another 

interception and create the 
big play. (He’s an) ascending 
player.”
It was a year ago that 
Metellus 
first 
earned 
his 
starting role. During fall camp, 
he mentioned that confidence 
was an issue for him at times in 
2017, when he was often a target 
of criticism from 
Michigan 
fans. 
That caused him 
to 
play 
“more 
passively” than 
he would have 
liked to.
According 
to 
Patridge, 
however, 
Metellus 
entered 
spring 
practices 
with 
an “open mind” to potential 
improvements he could make. 
Six months later, that has him 
keying a defense that is playing 
strong football.
“If I’m confident, I feel like the 
rest of the defense is confident,” 
Metellus said Saturday. “So 
I just feel like, being a leader 
on the defense, confidence is 
something you should have.”

Michigan places 14th 
at UNC Invitational

From 
the 
outset, 
it 
appeared to be a perfect 
storm for the Wolverines. 
Over 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
golf 
team 
traveled 
to 
North 
Carolina and battled through 
unfavorable 
conditions 
to 
place 14th amid a stacked 
field at the Ruth’s Chris Tar 
Heel Invitational.
Typically, 
the 
practice 
round 
before 
any 
big 
invitational is key. During 
this time the golfers check 
the speed of the greens, scope 
out any illusive tricks of the 
course and get a lay of the 
land. Exposure to the course 
is crucial for any golfer. If 
it can provide even a stroke 
of an advantage, it’s key for 
gaining that extra edge.
But 
over 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
not 
allowed their practice round 
due to safety concerns over 
Hurricane Michael rolling 
through the region. Instead 
of 
playing 
the 
full 
18, 
Michigan 
merely walked 
the first nine 
holes 
and 
sat 
indoors 
meticulously 
strategizing 
how it would 
attack the new 
course.
To 
make 
matters 
worse 
for 
the 
Wolverines, the UNC Finley 
Golf 
Course 
is 
made 
of 
different grass — Bermuda. 
Michigan typically practices 
on Flatgrass and had limited 
exposure to Bermuda this 
season. Not an end-all factor, 
but enough to set a golfer 
back if they’re not used to 
playing on the new grass.
But when it came time to 
play, Michigan left those 
factors 
behind 
and 
put 
together one of its more solid 
outings of the fledgling 2018-
19 season. And leading the 
pack was sophomore Ashley 
Kim.
Finishing at No. 20, Kim 
figured out the course early 
and definitively proved her 
role 
as 
the 
Wolverines’ 
most 
consistent 
golfer. 
Kim 
opened things 
up on Friday 
with the best 
round 
by 
a 
Michigan 
golfer with a 
71, 
good 
for 
one under par 
and a new season best. Kim 
used four birdies in the round 
to set the tone early.
“Ashley Kim, she’s been 
our 
best 
player 
so 
far,” 
said Michigan coach Jan 
Dowling. “She’s been close to 
par every round, and she’s on 
the verge of really breaking 
through and getting herself 
in contention to win.
“She’s on the verge of 

some 
great 
golf. 
She’s 
already playing some good 
golf, but she’s right on the 
verge of being able to win 
some of these tournaments 
individually, so that’s pretty 
huge.”
And right on Kim’s tail 
is 
freshman 
Ashley 
Lau. 
Seemingly seeking to rise to 
the level of her teammate, 
Lau shot a 72 in her second 
round and proved she can 
compete with the best. Then 
shooting 76s on the bookends 
of 
the 
invitational, 
Lau 
demonstrated her potential 
while also showing room for 
improvement.
For 
Lau, 
there’s 
no 
doubt that overcoming the 
challenges of living in a new 
country and playing against a 
different level of competition 
has been an adjustment for 
her. The Malaysia native is 
experiencing a whole new 
world of firsts and playing 
some quality golf in the 
process — two factors not 
lost on her coach.
“I think she’s coming into 
her 
own,” 
Dowling said. 
“The 
kid 
knows 
how 
to 
play, 
and 
I 
think 
just 
moving 
onto 
collegiate golf 
and 
getting 
comfortable 
there, 
and 
starting 
to 
balance living 
in a new country and going 
to school, there’s a lot of 
elements that go into playing 
good golf besides the obvious 
things. And you can tell she’s 
on the verge of going crazy 
under par, and she’s starting 
to find her own.
“Particularly, I hope that 
second round gave her some 
confidence. She got under par 
for quite a while. She’s just 
gotta clean up some things 
around her ball striking and 
her ball management, and 
she’ll be off to the races. 
We’re really excited about 
her potential.”
Dowling believes the team 
still needs to eliminate the 
small mistakes — errors that 
have been dogging her team 
all 
season. 
She 
thinks 
Michigan 
needs to take 
advantage 
of 
wedge 
shots 
and 
avoiding 
three-putting.
But still, it’s 
clear that the 
Wolverines 
are 
trending 
in 
the 
right 
direction.
“We’re 
not 
doing 
some 
of 
the 
simple 
things 
as 
consistently as we need to be, 
and those include capitalizing 
on short wedge shots and 
avoiding 
free 
putting,” 
Dowling said. “So when we’re 
gonna do that, it’s gonna be 
awesome. We’re pretty close, 
but simple isn’t always easy, 
but simple is still simple.”
