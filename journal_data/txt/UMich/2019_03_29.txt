The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Board of Regents convened Thursday 
afternoon for the last meeting of the 
winter 2019 term. Regents Michael 
Behm (D) and Mark Bernstein (D) 
were not present but called into the 
meeting, while Chair Ron Weiser was 
unable to attend or call in.
University President Mark Schlissel 
began the meeting by addressing the 
March 16 active shooter scare. He 
acknowledged that though there was 
no actual shooter, the fear community 

members felt was real. He thanked 
responders from the Division of Public 
Safety and Security and external law 
enforcement partners. He further said 
while many parts of their response 
went well, some had issues.
“While many aspects of our 
response went according to plan, 
we know we must improve others,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“Communications 
during this crisis proved to be 
problematic with some notifications 
delayed and others not delivered 
as expected. We are committed to 
rectifying this critical deficiency.”
The shooter scare occurred on 
the Diag during a vigil for victims 

of the shooting in two New Zealand 
mosques. Schlissel said the University 
has worked with Department of 
Public Safety Security to make it 
easier to receive alerts and to widely 
share information about what to do 
in active shooter situations and about 
opportunities for in-person training. 
Additionally, he wrote an email to 
students that is also available online.
Schlissel also shared the four 
individuals — Randy Schekman, 
University of California, Berkeley 
professor and Nobel Prize winner; 
Mark di Suvero, sculptor and peace 
activist; 
Leslie 
Uggams, 
award-
winning actress and singer; and 

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
— he recommended for honorary 
degrees. 
These 
individuals 
will 
receive their honorary degrees at 
the 
University’s 
commencement 
ceremony in May.
Additionally, Schlissel commended 
S. Jack Hu, vice president for research 
at the University, for his work to 
elevate campus research with an 
unwavering commitment to integrity 
and public impact. Hu is leaving the 
University in July to be the next senior 
vice president for academic affairs and 
provost at the University of Georgia.

Outside Room 2436 in Mason 
Hall, thousands of orange and 
beige tags consume the wall in an 
exhibition titled “Hostile Terrain: 
Exploring Border Security and 
Migration in 2019.”
The exhibit is a prototype 
of a project by Jason De León, 
associate professor and director 
of 
undergraduate 
studies 
of 
anthropology at the University 
of Michigan; Los Angeles-based 

photographer 
Michael 
Wells; 
artist Lucy Cahill, a U-M alum 
and a team of six University of 
Michigan students. 
“I would say that this project 
is just one of many translations of 
the anthropological work that we 
do,” De León said. “We’ve taken 
the data on migrant deaths and 
we’ve just translated it for a public 
audience.”
“Hostile Terrain” is composed 
of over 3,000 toe tags, which 
are tags morgues use for the 
identification of deceased bodies. 

The toe tags sit atop a map of the 
Arizona-Mexico border, in the 
exact location where the remains 
of the individual they represent 
were recovered.
The 
current 
exhibition 
in 
Mason Hall is a prototype of 
the pop-up installations that 94 
communities will host for one 
week in late September 2020. The 
number of toe tags featured in 
these installations will reflect the 
projected number of deaths in the 
Sonoran Desert in 2020. 
The 
tags 
in 
the 
exhibit 

reflect the names, locations and 
conditions of the people who died 
in the border crossing — beige tags 
denote identified remains and 
orange tags denote unidentified 
remains. 
They 
represent 
the 
bodies of migrants who will have 
died between 2000 and 2020 in 
the process of crossing the border 
between Mexico and Arizona. 
Their bodies are sometimes found 
only after bodily decomposition 
has made them too difficult to 
identify.
On 
Thursday 
evening, 
Michigan Movement hosted a 
banquet featuring speakers who 
had 
previously 
experienced 
homelessness but were able 
to surpass hardship and move 
forward. About 100 students 
and 
community 
members 
attended the event. 
Michigan Movement began 
after 
Public 
Health 
senior 
Hussain Ali, co-founder of the 
organization, was offered a 
newspaper on the street by a 
homeless man.
“When I was just going to 
classes or going out to dinner 
with friends, I always would 
see people on the sides and 
corners of the street with 
Groundcover newspapers,” Ali 
said. “I looked into it, and found 
out … they were vendors selling 
these papers for an income, and 
these vendors actually were 
experiencing homelessness or 
poverty. That really inspired 
me to look into this problem in 
Ann Arbor.”

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily
Protesters denouncing the University’s inaction on climate change, new felony disclosure policy and financial support for undocumented students during the Regents meeting 
held in the University Golf Course Clubhouse Thursday afternoon.


On Thursday evening, the LSA 

Opportunity Hub hosted a workshop 

in the LSA Building on celebrating your 

voice at work. About 20 students attended 

the event, which explored different 

dialects and the identities they represent 

in an attempt to answer questions 

about the roles they play in professional 

industries. The workshop was the third 

installment of the Hub’s bigger campaign 

to engage with identities while pursuing 

a career. 

Kierra Trotter, director of student 

engagement for the Opportunity Hub, 

explained the purpose of the campaign.

“We’re trying to help students explore 

and learn and develop, starting with 

who they are and how they want to see 

themselves in the future,” Trotter said.

The 
Thursday 
seminar 
and 

discussion was led by Kelly Wright, an 

experimental linguist in the Linguistics 

Department whose research involves 

dialect discrimination.

Wright began the seminar by 

explaining categorical perception and 

the role it plays in interpreting dialects. 

The relationship between people’s 

cultural expectations, their physical 

senses as well as the words that come out 

of their mouth all play off of one another, 

she said.

Wright explained that each specific 

dialect reflects individuals who think 

alike and talk about the same thing.

“We use all of our perspectival 

systems, every one of our senses and 

experiences in the world,” Wright said. 

“And we adapt to the patterns around 

us and the dominant languages in our 

community.”

According to Wright, where an 

individual is from and their own lived 

experiences often lie at the root of 

how they relate to others. Citing the 

“Michigan accent,” as an example, 

Wright explained that people often 

associate what is considered a “normal” 

accent with whatever their regional 

accent is. 

“It’s all about our understanding 

of culturally defined categories in the 

world,” Wright said. “We really do have 

very strong expectations of what we 

are going to see — how we parse up our 

signals and senses have to do with our 

interactions within the physical world.”

The workshop then transitioned into 

an interactive activity for its participants. 

Wright handed out a map of the U.S. and 

asked participants to circle the regions 

they thought could be associated with an 

accent or a dialect. 

“We have an egocentric perception 

— we are carrying all this information 

around about where we are in the world,” 

Wright said. “Who we are and where we 

are has a lot to do with how we hear other 

people.”

According to Wright, sociolinguistic 

variables are attached to different groups 

of people. That is, vowels, consonants 

and the sounds words make are often 

associated with specific communities. 

In this way, people are able to garner 

social information from a mere voice 

because their brains are keyed into social 

conditions. 

“Subject position is really strong for 

the ways we categorize,” Wright said. 

“Sometimes we hear things that aren’t 

there, but also that we don’t hear things 

that are there. This means that voice 

matters.”

This becomes a problem, Wright said, 

when linguistic discrimination occurs. 

In other words, when individuals are 

treated differently based on the way 

they sound. Such instances correlate 

with social stereotypes that are already 

present.

“This natural phenomenon of 

recognizing social knowledge has 

some pretty nasty consequences,” 

Wright said.

According to Wright, when people 

start to equate the way individuals 

speak with certain social groups, 

it can influence the natural speech 

perception system.

“Black 
voices 
are 
seen 
as 

aggressive or lazy, female voices 

sound shrill or pitchy, southern voices 

sound uneducated or slow-paced, 

New England voices sound fast-paced 

or confident to a fault,” Wright said.

After the event, LSA senior Carly 

Marten reflected on how different 

perceptions and generalizations can 

negatively impact communication.

“People need to think about how 

they have ideologies about language 

that are based on ideologies about 

groups of people who speak those 

languages,” Marten said. “They need 

to consider and deconstruct those 

narratives in order to interact with 

people as their true selves, rather 

than a caricature that is based on 

stereotypes in larger discourses.”

Wright 
noted 
how 
dialect 

discrimination is not addressed by the 

law explicitly.

“The law doesn’t feel that a 

voice is enough to establish social class 

membership,” Wright said. “It’s not 

provable that something fell out of my 

mouth and you heard me being in a 

particular group, but we know it works 

that way.”

Marten spoke about recognizing 

her privilege and keeping others in 

check when it comes to linguistic 

discrimination.

“Everyone changes the way they 

speak given who they are around,” 

Marten said. “I think people with power 

need to be intentional about the way in 

which they use language to judge and 

ultimately marginalize other people.”

Wright used the U.S. housing market 

to illuminate the real-world impacts 

of 
dialect 
discrimination. 
Before 

segregation laws, housing discrimination 

was overt; policies such as Eisenhower’s 

highway project, where a physical 

highway divided regions by class, 

illuminated that. With policies such as 

the Fair Housing Act, discrimination, 

instead of being eradicated, was pushed 

under the table, becoming covert.

Wright discussed the implications of 

this.

“Homeownership is the cornerstone 

of 
economics,” 
Wright 
said. 
“It 

determines things like generational 

wealth, school districts and tax bases. 

Keeping me out of the door when I call 

on the phone affects everything. This 

is about systematic, covert oppression 

based on race, voice and class.”

The workshop ended with Trotter 

emphasizing the importance of identity 

expression within the workplace.

“We want to make an impact on 

the employer, not just tell students to 

change who you are,” Trotter said. “We 

treat culture as a coat we have to take off 

before we go to work. You should be able 

to wear that coat in the workplace.”

Though career and style guides are 

changing to focus on the individuals 

themselves rather than fitting a mold, 

listeners were encouraged to become 

part of that change — to incorporate their 

personal stories into their professional 

prospects.

Alia Orra, global alumni and employer 

relations manager for Communications 

and Outreach at the Hub, explained 

the 
importance 
behind 
reframing 

the foundation of professional career 

advising.

“So much of career coaching is 

about adjusting your identity to match a 

norm,” Orra said. “We want to empower 

students to ask who created the norm 

and why.”

LSA freshman Barbara Collins on her story “Concerns rise over safety 
protocol for individuals with disabilities”:

“I got assigned the story Friday night and I knew that I would be having to interview 
people with disabilities, and I knew someone from home that was in a different journalism 
program that does have a disability, so I ended up contacting him to ask what the proper 
terminology was and how I should go about this, so I definitely did some back-up research 
on it. Then I inteterviewed Bradley, who was very passionate on the issue of accessibility 
around the school, and that the ‘run, hide, fight’ command was uninclusive of people with 
disabilities.”

‘Your Voice at Work’ talks embracing regional differences in speaking, code-switching


Schlissel then directly addressed 
points students would be discussing 
during the public comment portion 
of the meeting. 
He first addressed the “dissenting 
views” surrounding the recently 
announced 
felony 
self-disclosure 
policy by saying information helps 
maintain a safe community. Schlissel 
noted the University already has 
felony-related 
information 
about 
new employees through background 
checks, but this policy gives the 
University information about current 
employees.
“To be absolutely clear: history 
of a felony conviction does not 
automatically prevent an applicant 
from working at the University, 
nor would it necessarily result in a 
current employee losing their job,” 
Schlissel said. “Knowing about a 
serious criminal charge allows the 
University to take timely action 
in instances where there could be 
a significant risk of harm in the 
workplace.”
He noted this policy triggers an 
internal review and the University 
will “closely monitor” the policy 
to ensure it doesn’t have disparate 
impacts on certain communities.
Schlissel then discussed carbon 
neutrality by emphasizing he shares 
students’ urgency about the issue. He 
clarified the University will develop a 
plan to achieve carbon neutrality, and 
then will commit to a specific date.
“When we are at our best, our 
impact does not stop at the borders 
of our campuses,” Schlissel said. “We 
seek to change society, to help others 
and to make significant, measurable 
differences on the world we share.”
Schlissel noted the University has 
already achieved carbon reduction 
and carbon emission is down 7 
percent from the 2006 baseline, while 
the physical campus has grown since 
then by 20 percent. He also said he is 
aware of the controversy surrounding 
the plan to expand the Central 
Power Plant, but said the University 
would need to purchase more coal-
based electricity. Functioning as 
a university, especially one with 
a major hospital, requires a lot of 
energy, and fossil fuels are the only 
way to provide enough energy for the 
foreseeable future, Schlissel said. 
He also noted the President’s 
Commission on Carbon Neutrality 
added a public session of the 
commission on April 9. To end his 
speech, he commended University 
athletic teams for their success 
throughout the year.
After Schlissel finished, Regent 
Denise Ilitch (D), vice chair of the 
board, commended Schlissel on 
his election into the John Hopkins 
Society of Scholars. The society — the 

first of its kind in the U.S. — honors 
faculty who have served at least a year 
at Johns Hopkins and have received 
distinction in their discipline while 
not working at the school.
Following Schlissel’s remarks, Joy 
Beatty, vice chair of Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs and 
a professor at U-M Dearborn, said 
faculty care about the University 
and are well-poised to offer advice 
on University affairs. She requested 
faculty to be included in decision-
making processes so there is time 
to offer constructive and helpful 
feedback.
Specifically, 
Beatty 
noted 
faculty’s 
longstanding 
concerns 
about the Office for Institutional 
Equity’s processes, including lack 
of notification, due process and 
opportunity for appeals as well as 
long timelines for investigations. She 
said the Senate Assembly is preparing 
suggestions for improvements and 
passed resolutions to share with the 
Office of the Provost.
“To realize the full benefit to the 
community that stems from the 
consultation with involved faculty, 
elected faculty representatives need 
to be included early in decision-
making processes, so that there 
is time to offer constructive and 
thoughtful feedback,” Beatty said. 
“If we are consulted after decisions 
have already been made or too 
late in the process for substantive 
feedback, the administration risks 
becoming entangled in conversations 
which miss key points of community 
concern.”
During updates from the regional 
campuses, 
it 
was 
announced 
that Schlissel will be on the U-M 
Dearborn campus next week to give 
a speech about the future of higher 
education and the importance of 
a growth mindset. Additionally, 
according to the board, significant 
progress on scholarships and funding 
for student support has been made 
on the Flint campus because of the 
success of the Victors for Michigan 
campaigns.
The board voted on appointments, 
buildings, degree programs, policy 
and partnerships. One action request 
that was approved was a master 
affiliation and related joint venture 
agreement 
between 
Michigan 
Medicine 
and 
Sparrow 
Health 
System of central Michigan.
The 
board 
also 
approved 
an addition of classrooms and 
accessibility improvements to the 
Detroit Observatory, the second-
oldest building on campus. The 
project will cost an estimated $10 
million.
E. Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, commended Daniel 
Greene, Central Student Government 
president, for his leadership. She 
called him “tenacious” and said his 
leadership has made “the University 
stronger.”

In his final address to the board, 
Greene, a Public Policy senior, said he 
struggled to decide what to discuss. 
He began by thanking faculty 
members and DPSS, then discussed 
how to build a better University in 
the future.
He said in the past he has 
spoken on a variety of topics — 
from food insecurity to mental 
health awareness on campus — but 
reflected on how the University can 
be more accessible and inclusive 
going forward. Greene emphasized 
it is important every student feels 
welcome and safe on campus.
Greene noted the University’s 
strides in these areas, including 
the Go Blue Guarantee, the Maize 
and Blue Cupboard, the Trotter 
Multicultural Center and the holistic 
well-being model. However, he said 
he realizes the campus community 
at-large still has a long way to go. 
Greene said CSG ideally represents 
all students, but he hoped his role 
has also been as an advocate for 
those voices who were not heard on 
campus.
“Our institutional values include 
equity, diversity, liberty and justice,” 
Greene said. “Our mission statement 
calls for developing leaders and 
citizens who will challenge the 
present and enrich the future. 
Unfortunately, those values and 
mission are not always upheld. We as 
a campus community still fall short 
in our mission and, unfortunately, 
oftentimes fall short for the most 
vulnerable members of our campus 
community. For me, the Michigan of 
the future has a campus community 
where visible and invisible identities 
… do not predict the quality nor the 
potential of each student’s Michigan 
experience.”
Public comments
During the public comments 
portion of the Board of Regents 
meeting on Thursday, 15 students 
and community members addressed 
the board and University of Michigan 
administration. 
They 
discussed 
carbon 
neutrality, 
the 
felony 
disclosure policy and undocumented 
students.
Carbon Neutrality
The first speaker was U-M 
alum Jan Culbertson, leadership 
council chair of the Ann Arbor 2030 
District partnership. She discussed 
setting standards on University 
buildings as part of its goal to reach 
carbon neutrality. Culbertson said 
because the University is such a big 
institution, it has the opportunity 
to make a huge impact and asked 
the board to actively set standards 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
from University buildings.
LSA 
sophomore 
Hallie 
Fox, 
member of the Climate Action 
Movement, then asked University 
President Mark Schlissel and the 
Board of Regents to take stronger 
action and show the same level of 

commitment to achieving carbon 
neutrality as the students have. 
She noted while she and her fellow 
students are passionate about climate 
change, they need Schlissel’s help to 
achieve their goals.
“You say it’s not reasonable for us 
to divest from carbon-based energy 
sources,” Fox said. “If we’re lucky 
enough to spend millions of dollars 
renovating University office space, 
then we’re wealthy enough to invest 
in the urgent need for true carbon 
neutrality on campus. President 
Schlissel and the regents, I challenge 
you to take meaningful action like 
the rest of us. Time and time again, 
us students have been brave enough 
to take a stand… We’ve showed our 
commitment to carbon neutrality. So 
far, you showed us your commitment 
to taking small actions that aim to 
appease the masses.”
Rackham student Gordon Fitch 
also spoke about the University’s path 
to carbon neutrality. Fitch claimed 
when he signed up to speak at this 
meeting, he had hoped he would 
be congratulating Schlissel and 
the regents on their excellent work 
setting an achievable goal to reduce 
emissions. Instead, Fitch discussed 
his disappointment in the University 
for its treatment of student protesters 
during the Climate Strike on March 
15.
“You decided it was preferable to 
arrest peaceful protesters, including 
minors, rather than simply agreeing 
to an open meeting,” Fitch said. “Since 
then, we have heard from those high 
school student organizers that they 
are no longer interested in attending 
the University of Michigan, so long 
as it continues to refuse substantive 
action on climate change. These are 
some of the brightest, most dynamic 
young people in Ann Arbor — if any 
of the 15- to 18-year-olds out there fit 
the description of leaders and best, 
it’s them.”
Fitch said he hopes the University 
will begin creating more substantive 
policies on carbon neutrality going 
forward.
“It would be a shame — and I 
really mean a shame — on you,” Fitch 
said. “If you continue to allow this 
issue to drive a wedge between this 
great university and the current, 
future and former students that are 
its lifeline, but I hope that you will 
reconsider your position to commit to 
neutrality before it’s too late.” 
Felony Disclosure Policy
Cozine Welch, a Prison Creative 
Arts Project member and a formerly 
incarcerated individual, discussed 
how he often feels like an outsider 
on campus and how this policy 
reinforces those feelings. He said he, 
as well as other formerly incarcerated 
people, provide an opportunity for 
the community to grow.
“I don’t see myself reflected on 
campus in race, in culture or socio-
economic status and circumstance,” 

Welch said. “But the University 
is lacking in the diversity a public 
university needs in order to be fully 
prepared to educate students and it’s 
this. These are not just my words — 
any students that have been fortunate 
enough to teach will tell you the 
same. Their parents will tell you, 
student evaluations will tell you, the 
formerly incarcerated are an asset 
to this university, this thing in this 
country at large, we are even without 
the advantage of equal opportunity 
or former education. Through self-
taught means and Herculean efforts 
in a system set to deny us, we acquire 
education, the only thing that cannot 
be taken.”
Welch 
said 
this 
policy 
disproportionately targets people 
of color and those of lower socio-
economic statuses. He then called on 
Schlissel and the board to rescind the 
policy.
LSA senior Hannah French, 
a PCAP member, said the felony 
disclosure policy does not follow 
through on its claims to promote 
campus safety. French discussed 
how she has learned a lot from 
the formerly incarcerated and she 
claimed the policy promotes mass 
incarceration and is harming the 
community rather than making it 
more secure.
“As a student, I am ashamed to 
be paying tuition that supports mass 
incarceration, especially when my 
best learning on the subject comes 
from interactions with people who 
have lived experience,” French said. 
“This policy is not preventative, it 
does not mitigate risk; its safety is 
really presumed and it is limited to a 
very specific population. This is not 
the only way that the University is 
further repressing and harming our 
communities. The University claims 
to uplift student voices, but it remains 
silent on issues which target and 
suppress them.”
Policy 
regarding 
undocumented students
Taubman 
freshman 
Juan 
Muñoz-Ponce is an undocumented 
student 
and 
member 
of 
the 
Student Community of Progressive 
Empowerment. He discussed the 
University’s 
policy 
that 
allows 
undocumented 
students 
to 
get 
in-state tuition. He claimed the policy 
has a requirement of applying within 
28 weeks of graduating high school, 
but he said many undocumented 
students live in poverty and often 
need more time.
Muñoz-Ponce and fellow SCOPE 
members asked Schlissel and the 
board to consider changing the policy 
to give students more time to apply. 
Muñoz-Ponce said he was not able to 
apply for in-state residency within 28 
months and his appeal was denied. 

“This elections season has 
been nothing short of electric 
- we thank the student body for 
their enthusiasm for our party, 
our ideas, and most importantly 
our candidates,” they wrote. 
“Tonight serves as a win not 
only for the executive ticket, 
but for our representatives, 

street team, and our entire core 
who all invested their time 
and energy into the campaign. 
Managing a full party and 
running a campaign is no easy 
task, and without the work of 
our team, it never could have 
happened.”
Argha 
ran 
independently 
under 
a 
three-pronged 
platform. 
He 
hoped 
to 
implement initiatives including 
“Ban the Bottle” to eliminate 

all plastic water bottle sales on 
campus, “Change the Cycle” to 
provide free feminine hygiene 
products in campus restrooms 
and “WTH is CSG?” to help 
increase awareness of CSG 
through hosting social events. 
His platform also included 
plans to tackle diversity, mental 
health, 
affordability 
and 
sustainability.
Students 
selected 
representatives 
for 
their 

respective colleges: 14 for LSA, 
six for Engineering, seven for 
Rackham, four for Business and 
one for each of the remaining 13 
colleges.
Also on the ballot was an 
amendment to add a CSG 
commission to select justices 
of the judiciary committee. The 
amendment passed with 1,759 
votes in favor. 
At the end of their statement, 
Gerstein 
and 
Blanchard 

emphasized their commitment 
to the student body. 
“We will work tirelessly 
on behalf of the students of 
this university, to make this 
university work for you, and to 
make each and every student 
feel that this is their home,” 
they wrote. “We can’t say that 
this will be an easy journey, or 
that we’ll never misstep, but at 
the end of the day, we will never 
stop working for you.”

“I would hope that for those 
folks (who have a direct connection 
to this issue) that we’re doing this 
(exhibition) respectfully, that we’re 
raising awareness, and that with 
what we’re doing, for those folks we 
can memorialize those who have 
been lost,” De León said. “But we’re 
also doing this for the people who 
have never even thought about this 
issue, so we can emotionally connect 
with an audience, also, that has never 
thought about this issue previously.”
Though the first iterations of the 
exhibit featured tags filled out by the 
project’s team members, hundreds 
of University students were involved 
in filling out each tag’s information 
by hand in the days preceding the 
exhibit’s opening.
LSA senior Daniel López is one of 
the project’s team members and has 
worked as an undergraduate research 
assistant with De León for two years. 
Some of López’s responsibilities 
include photographing and videoing 
the installation of the exhibit, 
documenting 
its 
process 
and 
publicizing the project online and 
through social media.
He said De León’s approach 
to communicating the stories of 
undocumented immigrants through 
photography 
and 
multimedia 
distinguishes 
the 
project 
from 
written research.
“I think I have a personal 
connection to the project, just 
because 
I 
am 
undocumented 
myself,” López said. “He (De Léon) 
humanizes immigrants in a way that 
other researchers don’t — he talks 
about them, he provides a platform 
for them to have a voice, and I think 
that that’s what, like, drew me to 
work with him.”
One of the intentions of the exhibit 
is to raise awareness of the deaths 
and suffering that have been occurring 
along the Mexico and United States 
border for more than 20 years.
In the 1990s, the U.S. Border Patrol 
enacted a policy that redirected paths 
of migration between Mexico and 
the United States toward extremely 
dangerous terrains. The policy, titled 
“Prevention Through Deterrence,” 
entailed militarizing the traditional 
points of entry along the border. With 
these points of entry cut off, migrants 
had to to seek out paths in more 
remote areas, where it was hoped the 
dangers of the natural environment 
would discourage migrants from 
undertaking the journey.
“One of the understandings was 
early on was that if enough people died 
from this policy, that they would stop 
coming,” De León said. “But what has 
happened is that a lot of people have 
died, but they still have not stopped 
coming.”
This policy was put into place 
in 1994, which is the reason 94 
communities will host the exhibit in 
the future.
The 
Sonoran 
Desert, 
which 
blankets the area where Arizona, 
California and Mexico intersect, 
contains one of the hostile paths that 
migrants travel along when crossing 
the border. Thousands of people have 
died on this journey since 2000 due 
to dehydration, hyperthermia and 
other consequences of the natural 
environment.
“The implication of the full policy 
is knowingly putting people in harm’s 
way, (and) it knowingly leads to the 
death of a lot of people,” De León said. 
“And yet it’s still in place, and no one 
seems to want to keep talking about it.”
De León is the director of the 
Undocumented Migration Project, 
based at the University of Michigan, a 
“long-term anthropological analysis of 
clandestine border crossings” between 
Mexico and the United States. “Hostile 
Terrain” is a smaller project within the 
UMP.
The UMP uses “a combination 
of ethnographic and archaeological 
approaches” to study the process and 
experience of these border crossings. 
De León’s research focuses on the 
material culture of border crossings, 
which refers to the material items 
such as clothing and water bottles 
that migrants leave behind on their 
journeys.
López said he thinks the exhibit 
will 
encourage 
viewers 
at 
the 
University to think about the realities 
of undocumented migration outside of 
popular contexts.
“I feel like we don’t humanize 
people, you know,” López said. “We 
just talk, like, about policy and stuff 
like that, but what about the people 
who are suffering, what about the 
people who are dying, for example?”
LSA senior Moncerrat Llamas 
first heard about the exhibit through 
friends on social media who are 
involved with the project.

Recognizing the realities of the false shooter alert
W

hen asked about my 
experience with the 
active 
shooter 
scare 
last Saturday, I compress it into a 
few sentences: My roommate and 
I were in the Diag for the vigil. We 
got separated and had no way of 
contacting one another. We both 
spent two hours wondering if the 
other had been shot. But it was more 
than that truncation. It was realer 
than those few clauses suggest. So 
here, I retell our story: 
For 40 minutes, we mourn. My 
roommate and I meet each other in 
the Diag to attend the vigil in honor 
of the men, women and children who 
were killed at the Al Noor Mosque 
and Linwood Islamic Center in 
Christchurch, New Zealand. Some 
of us hold hands, many hold back 
tears and speakers much braver 
than I am choke over the names of 
people killed in the past decade by 
white supremacist terrorism. We 
bow our heads. We witness cries of 
terrible grief and cries of rallying, 
unbelievable power. We are together.
In a split second, we are driven 
apart. It appears as though panic 
travels in a wave, bodies farthest 
from me remaining upright, fleeing, 
and bodies closer to me ducking, 
hitting the ground, both willfully 
and unwillfully. I process this wave, 
this relative motion, because at first 
I do not move. Later, I will question 
my reflexes in this moment. While 
actual seconds lapsed before I 
responded to the imperative run, it 
took no time at all for me to accept 
that it was happening, that we were 
under attack. To think, yes, of course 
it would happen right now. We have 
been waiting our turn. To rationalize, 
yes, of course it would be here. They 
would target us for mourning. They 
would kill us for demanding memory, 
demanding action, demanding a 

world without massacre.
When I do finally manage to run, 
I fall, too. As I stand back up after 
collapsing, I realize I do not know 
where my roommate who I came 
with, mourned with, is. I look around. 
How could so many people vanish? 
Why did they tell us to run toward 
Mason Hall and then away? Why 
didn’t I grab her hand, why didn’t I 
grab her hand, why didn’t I grab her 
hand … 
I return to the Diag. People seize 
the microphone — used minutes 
earlier to eulogize, to give speeches, to 
deliver poems — and initiate searches 
for people who got lost in the chaos. 
One of the brave students who voiced 
one of the mournful, rallying cries 
asks me if I’ve seen a little boy with a 
camouflage jacket. Later that week, I 
will see this same student walking to 
a classroom in Mason. I will stop and 
try not to stare at him, at this person 
who had no concern for himself, 
concerned himself solely with the 
recovery of a stranger’s child. All I can 
croak out to him in the moment is a 
sorrowful “No.”
I try to reach her. Two phone 
calls, no answer. They are telling us 
to seek shelter in the Harlan Hatcher 
Library. I redial. I redial. “Hello?” on 
the fourth. I inhale; I am buying time, 
and in that bought time, I pretend I 
don’t know it’s not her voice. I exhale, 
“Hey.” I gulp, “Where are you?” The 
person with the voice that is not my 
roommate’s tells me she is sitting 
on a bench inside Hatcher. She has 
collected phones that were dropped 
when people started running. I 
think I am still exhaling when I see 
the person who is not my roommate 
and pick up my roommate’s phone. I 
cannot reach her, I cannot reach her, 
I cannot reach her…
For two hours, I am without her. 
For 16 phone calls, I am in a desperate, 

pleading, relentless search of her. For 
a quarter of them I am crying. People 
on the other end of the line remind me 
to breathe. A stranger in the library 
rubs my back when I start crying 
and, whenever they move us between 
floors of Hatcher and escort us past 
police officers holding the largest 
weapons I have ever seen in person, 
they ensure I keep moving. Later, I 
will process these sacrifices people 
made for my sanity. I will marvel at 
the endless capacity to give that some 
people have, even in these scenarios 
that try to take all that you have.
During the last of these 16 phone 
calls, I am back where I started. We 
have been told that they have cleared 
the libraries and the Diag. People 
are going home. I contemplate aloud 
whether I should follow suit; I feel 
a need to stay in the place I last saw 
her and wait for her to come back, 
but the friend speaking on the phone 
with me tells me I should go home. 
I hesitate and look back to the last 
place I saw my roommate when I see 
another piece of her: her backpack. 
I rush over, pick it up, and decide, 
yes, I will go home. I will carry her 
phone and mine, her backpack and 
mine, bringing these small pieces 
of her to her. I will tell myself she is 
already home, wondering where I am. 
Later, I still will avoid the thoughts 
I was avoiding then. I will swallow 
hard at the thought of seeing the text 
messages on her phone, friends and 
relatives asking if she was okay, that 
I could not answer. At the thought of 
carrying pieces of her and wondering 
if I would see the whole her again.

T

he United States has 
a lot of strengths as a 
nation. It’s in a large, 
resource-rich and geographically 
advantageous location — isolated 
from potential threats by great 
oceans. 
Despite 
exorbitant 
education costs, it is still home to 
the vast majority of the world’s best 
higher-learning institutions. It has 
the oldest, and one of the most 
impressive, constitutions in the 
world. Thanks to these factors, and 
a host of others, the United States 
is a global superpower. However, 
the United States’ foreign policy, 
both historically and in the 
present day, has done nothing 
but undermine the United States’ 
tactical and economic strengths, 
hindering its ability to act as a 
world leader. U.S. foreign policy 
in the 20th and 21st centuries has 
hurt international development 
and growth, as well as the United 
States’ own standing in global 
geopolitics. Through an aversion 
to multilateral cooperation, the 
United States has disregarded 
alliances it could (and should) have 
utilized, irritating other nations 
and diminishing its own power. 
As China and other nations rapidly 
develop, it’s time for the U.S. to 
make a long-overdue foreign policy 
shift from an adversarial lone wolf 
to a cooperative coalition leader.
Perhaps nothing embodies the 
United States’ adverse relationship 
with multilateralism more than the 
League of Nations. In the wake of 
World War I, President Woodrow 
Wilson (correctly) theorized that 
a large organization promoting 
international 
cooperation 
was 
needed in order to maintain 
lasting global peace. With this 
in mind, Wilson introduced the 
idea of a “general association of 
nations,” an organization aimed at 
both resolving inter-state disputes 
diplomatically 
and 
preventing 
war through collective security. 
At the Paris Peace Conference in 
1919, Wilson was able to convince 
nations around the world to join, 
and, on Nov. 1, 1920, 41 nations 
convened in Geneva for the League 
of Nations’ inaugural session.
There was only one problem: The 
United States was not one of the 41 
nations present. Despite creating 
the League of Nations himself, 
Wilson was unable to convince a 
stubborn, isolationist U.S. Senate 
to agree to join. While the League 
of Nations was not designed to be 
particularly strong — for instance, 
it lacked armed forces with which 
to enforce its decrees — the 
United States’ decision not to join 
rendered the organization useless. 
Understanding how irrelevant and 
powerless the League of Nations 
was, Germany and Japan both 
withdrew in 1933, and six years 
later, Wilson’s worst fears were 
realized: Unable to cooperate, 
nations around the world had 
once again plunged into conflict 
alongside the rise of Adolf Hitler. 
Following the Second World 
War, it seemed that the United 
States 
had 
finally 
begun 
to 
understand 
the 
benefits 
of 
multilateralism. The U.S. became 
a founding member of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization in 
1949 and appeared willing to work 
with its Western European allies. 

However, less than 20 years after 
joining NATO, the U.S. began to 
(again) ignore the desires of its 
own allies, much to their chagrin. 
At the 1964 North Atlantic Council 
Meeting, the United States had 
attempted to convince its NATO 
allies to launch an offensive 
against Vietnamese communists. 
However, the U.S.’s European allies 
declined, criticizing the mission as 
an unwinnable war in an area they 
did not see as a major threat and as 
one that would only take resources 
away from defending their own 
borders. Undeterred by NATO’s 
resounding disapproval, the U.S. 
deployed troops to Vietnam in 1965, 
beginning a lengthy and fruitless 
U.S. military campaign. Harlan 
Cleveland, the U.S. representative 
for NATO, even admitted the U.S. 
viewed itself as above the alliance, 
saying the U.S.’s approach to 
working with NATO primarily 
consisted of “consent building 
notifications after the event.” 
Ultimately, the U.S. left Vietnam 
in 1975 after an unsuccessful and 
drawn-out campaign, which had 
done nothing but antagonize their 
own allies and destabilize the 
United States’ relationships.
Thanks to the collapse of the 
Soviet Union in 1991, a mere 16 
years after the Vietnam debacle 
had concluded, the United States 
became, indisputably, the most 
powerful nation in the world. 
Despite this golden opportunity 
to promote peace and prosperity 
around the globe, it only took 
the U.S. until 2003 to once again 
bewilder and enrage its own 
allies. In February of that year, 
Colin Powell, the U.S. Secretary 
of State, delivered a speech to the 
United Nations Security Council 
advocating for an invasion of Iraq, 
based on the false claim Iraq had 
weapons of mass destruction. 
With the exception of the United 
Kingdom, all U.S. allies staunchly 
disagreed with the invasion. In 
response to the U.S.’s plan, French 
Foreign 
Minister 
Dominique 
de Villepin said, “We think that 
military intervention would be the 
worst possible solution.” Germany 
agreed with France’s assessment, 
and French President Jacques 
Chirac said he and German 
Chancellor 
Gerhard 
Schröder 
would do everything they could to 
prevent a conflict. Backed only by 
the U.K., the U.S. decided to invade 
Iraq anyway, resulting in a war that 
destabilized the region horribly, 
killed more than 650,000 people 
and found no weapons of mass 
destruction. Once again, the U.S. 
had gone against the wishes of its 
own allies, acting not like a global 
leader, but rather an overzealous 
war machine.
Even today, the consequences 
of the U.S.’s aversion towards 
collaboration 
have 
direct 
consequences on world affairs and 
hinder American effectiveness. 
For example, the U.S. recently 
sent aid to Venezuela to help the 
country’s deprived citizens during 
the nation’s period of mass unrest. 
Seizing on the U.S.’s history of 
politically 
motivated 
foreign 
aid missions in the Americas 
and politically charged tweets 
by President Donald Trump’s 
administration, 
Venezuelan 

President 
Nicolás 
Maduro 
justified blocking the aid, saying 
it was intended to prop up his 
opponent, Juan Guaidó. Whether 
or not the U.S. had genuinely 
been acting in good faith (which 
is highly debatable), Maduro had 
successfully 
used 
the 
United 
States’ past actions as an excuse to 
limit aid to his own people.
However, no current issue 
highlights the world’s desperate 
need for a cooperative U.S. more 
than climate change. In 2016, 195 
nations around the world signed off 
on the Paris climate agreement, an 
agreement aimed at limiting (and 
eventually reducing) the emission 
of greenhouse gases. Crucially, 
the Paris agreement relies on 
the good faith of the member 
nations: It is up to each country to 
determine how they plan to limit 
their greenhouse gas emissions. 
Unsurprisingly, different nations 
showed varying levels of intent 
— Nicaragua initially didn’t even 
ratify the agreement, arguing 
it didn’t go far enough. On the 
other end of the spectrum is the 
United 
States. 
Despite 
being 
the second biggest producer of 
carbon dioxide (and the biggest 
per capita producer), the United 
States withdrew from the Paris 
agreement in 2017, with Trump 
saying it would undermine the U.S. 
economy. With an opportunity to 
take the lead on a critical global 
issue, the United States decided to 
shirk responsibility, ignoring the 
destructive consequences of its 
actions.
Unfortunately for the U.S., 
rectifying their past missteps in 
foreign policy will be a difficult 
task that cannot be completed 
overnight. However, the U.S. 
can still begin by displaying a 
fundamental change in attitude. 
The U.S. may have a larger military 
than its allies, or a bigger economy, 
but neither of those factors justify 
continually 
strong-arming 
our 
allies, 
something 
the 
United 
States should acknowledge and 
apologize for. Going forward, 
the United States should rejoin 
the Paris climate agreement and 
UNESCO and stop constantly 
antagonizing its own allies. An 
overhaul of U.S. foreign relations 
doesn’t 
necessarily 
need 
to 
involve introducing new large-
scale international treaties, but 
rather simply working with the 
nations the U.S. claims to already 
be allied with and fulfilling its 
responsibilities on global issues 
such as climate change. Ultimately, 
the U.S. has not thrived because 
of an aggressive, individualistic 
foreign policy, but rather in spite 
of it.
While the Trump administration 
will surely not be the one that fixes 
this, that doesn’t mean the situation 
is a lost cause. Hopefully, the United 
States’ future leaders will work 
collaboratively with leaders around 
the globe to form coalitions aimed 
at promoting peace and prosperity, 
understanding the things that 
benefit both the United States and 
the world as a whole.

B

orn in the last year of the 
“Disney Renaissance,” I 
grew up watching animated 
childhood tales with my family. 
Far from mindless cartoons, these 
films explored meaning through 
narratives of love, betrayal, coming 
of age and more — solidifying 
themselves as archetypal stories 
for entire generations. In no small 
terms, these animated films are 
often the preeminent means of 
social education for young children. 
They tell young, eager minds how 
to be happy, how to treat friends, 
how to treat the opposite sex, how 
to find meaning, how to behave 
toward parents and how to grow 
up. They orient the minds of 
children to the way of doing things 
here in the Western world. Clinical 
psychologist 
Jordan 
Peterson 
examines these archetypes in “The 
Little Mermaid”, “Sleeping Beauty”, 
“The Lion King”, “Pinocchio” and 
other classics in his lectures at 
the University of Toronto. After 
analyzing the fundamental hero 
myth in “Beauty and the Beast” 
during a segment on a news talk 
show, Peterson said, “A story is 
something that you can’t contrive. 
It has to manifest itself in some 
sense. The story has an internal 
logic. If you’re aiming it at a moral 
statement, then it’s not art, it’s 
propaganda, and it’ll fall flat.”
As I got older, animation had 
less of an impact on my beliefs, and 
aside from a few wildly imaginative 
stories like Studio Ghibli’s “Princess 
Mononoke”, Laika’s “Kubo and the 
Two Strings”, and Pixar’s “Up” 
and “The Incredibles”, I began to 
see animation as a sort of passive 
entertainment: bright stimulating 
colors, humorous sound effects and 
a simple three-act structure. The 
colloquialism of Saturday-morning 
cartoons lends this expendable, 
shallow classification to animation, 
something a parent might put on 
in the background to distract their 
three-year-old 
while 
dressing 
them. I began to look exclusively 
at live-action cinema for dramatic 
stories and when a new blockbuster 
animation headlined the marquee 
at my local theater (as with “Wreck-
It Ralph” and “Moana”), I always 
left underwhelmed.
My mindset changed last week 
when I saw “Spider-Man: Into the 
Spider-Verse.” First, there was the 
“living painting” style of animation 
that mixed line work, painting, 
dots and other comic book visual 
techniques to make it appear hand-
crafted, “Achieved by artists taking 
rendered frames from the CGI 
animators and working on top of 
them in 2D.” This brilliant work 
could lead a viewer to believe that 
Spider-Man, a nimble, squishy 

acrobat suspended in webs, and 
his story were made for animation. 
Then 
there 
was 
the 
superb 
soundtrack that sampled from 
some of the biggest rap and hip-
hop names in the world including 
Aminé, Juice Wrld, Lil Wayne, 
Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, Swae 
Lee and XXXTentacion, aiding 
the animation with its involved 
and energetic rhythm. But what 
fascinated me the most about 
“Spider-Verse” was its portrayal 
of changing social identities in a 
modern world.
To start, this film’s protagonist 
and central Spider-Man, Miles 
Morales, is the son of a Puerto Rican 
nurse and African-American cop. In 
the franchise’s last three iterations, 
Spider-Man was played by a young 
white guy, informing the audience 
with a cultural lens unique to that 
identity. Now, with Miles, Spider-
Man can be something different. 
Aside from a positive stride in racial 
representation in cinema, following 
the efforts of “Black Panther” in 
allowing young people of color to 
identify more closely with their 
favorite superheroes, Spider-Man’s 
new non-white identity brings 
something fresh to the story. This 
Spider-Man is different, current 
and compelling: He has a new 
passion, taste in music, vernacular, 
group 
of 
friends 
and 
family 
dynamic, reinvigorating a classic 
story with a new lens. These traits 
are not so much tied to Miles’ race 
but are necessarily informed by the 
cultural implications of growing 
up as a person of color in New York 
City. Miles spray paints art murals 
with his uncle in the subway, listens 
to Post Malone while doing his 
homework and exchanges Spanish 
terms of endearment with his 
bilingual mother. An article by The 
Washington Post further examines 
these intersectional identities. The 
article describes Miles Morales’ arc 
as the following:
“The recognition that you are a 
freak; the isolation of the closet; the 
discovery of freaks like you, who 
might come to stand in for biological 
family; the play of identification and 
shame within a stigmatized group, 
of revulsion and self-acceptance, 
initiation and competition; turning 
freakishness into a weapon against 
adversity; and perhaps the eventual 
reintegration — of some part of 
yourself — into mainstream society, 
or at least into the family.”
The article argues that despite 
Miles’ heterosexual identity, the 
story resembles the stages of a 
coming-out story, paralleling his 
secret superhero identity with 
that of a closeted gay person. Later 
in the film, we’re introduced to a 
quasi-anime animation style with 

Japanese-American Peni Parker 
and her telepathic Spider-Bot, an 
alternate version of Spider-Man. 
This isn’t “diversity equals good” 
storytelling but instead a modern 
way to link the story of Spider-
Man to contemporary experiences 
of not only Asian and homosexual 
identities but of all people. In 
this way, “Spider-Verse” invites 
all audiences to connect and see 
themselves as the protagonist: a 
superhero. As the world continues 
to become more interconnected 
through film, and the stories of 
marginalized populations find the 
spotlight, “Spider-Verse” seeks to 
make room in an American story 
for the new voices in the room.
There are times when this well-
intended, progressive portrayal of 
identities seems a bit contrived. In 
the final act, Miles and his team 
of interdimensional Spider-People 
attempt to disrupt the villain 
Kingpin’s nuclear supercollider. 
In his final goodbyes to his team, 
Miles addresses Gwen Stacy, who 
up until this point in the film has 
been treated as a love interest, with 
an extended handshake. “Friends?” 
he asks. “Friends,” she agrees. 
Screen Rant writes that the story 
of the sequel “... will be focused on 
the romantic relationship between 
Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, 
which is a thread from executive 
producer and co-writer Phil Lord’s 
original script for the first movie.” 
And yet, this movie attempts to 
shoehorn a “not-all-female-leads-
must-be-love-interests” 
lesson 
into the same story that, for the 
last hour and a half, framed Gwen 
and Miles’ relationship as the 
embarrassing and flirtatious high-
school romance. A moment that 
tried to help viewers check their 
subconscious 
classification 
of 
the attractive female lead as 
necessarily filling the role of 
the romantic interest, which 
albeit is a valid meta-criticism of 
superhero tropes, felt awkward 
and out of character for both 
Miles and Gwen.
Aside from this infrequent 
faux pas, the film expertly 
addresses a modern audience by 
placing social identities at the 
heart of this Spider-Man, Spider-
Woman, and Spider-Robot story. 
“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-
Verse” pushes the boundaries of 
animation and reimagines the 
mid-century superhero comic 
to include the conversations of 
today, and for these reasons, it 
returns archetypal stories to the 
realm of animation.

Jenny 
Lewis 
is 
indie’s 
undisputed princess. She has 
been from the moment she 
stepped foot on the scene in 
1998, and still maintains her 
position of respect in the genre. 
Beginning with the popular band 
Rilo 
Kiley 
(we’ve 
all heard their hit 
“Silver Lining” a few 
times) and making 
her mark on several 
other groups, Lewis 
has 
established 
herself as a master of 
many trades over the 
past two decades of 
music-making. This 
week’s unveiling of 
Lewis’s fourth album On the Line, 
her first solo release in five years, 
is a milestone in many ways. 
It’s an obvious example of her 
growth as both a musician and a 
human being, the record’s humor 
and cleverness a testament to 
Lewis’s resilience after losing 
her estranged mother and a long-
term relationship in the same 
few years. One of many things 
Lewis is good at is attacking 
the tragedies we all face with a 
perspective equal parts witty 
and gentle. This makes for music 
that traverses several different 
genres, but rests on the same 
foundation of brilliant candor.
Jenny Lewis not only has a 
command of indie rock’s fickle 
landscape, but also that of 
indie folk, alternative country 
and everything in between. 
Her approach to each song 

is different, yet all of them 
have a trademark confessional 
quality that Lewis is known for. 
However, the personal aspect 
of her music never overshadows 
its genuine innovation. There’s 
no sappiness, despite the subject 
matter: Every song is expertly 
produced and arranged, weaving 
Lewis’s acidic wit with a variety 
of synth, guitar and even a few 

organ tracks throughout the 
album. She sings about her 
“Wasted Youth,” about addiction 
on album highlight “Little White 
Dove,” about the sadness at the 
end of the party in “Red Bull 
and Hennessy.” On the Line is 
what happens when a musician 
truly knows herself, allowing 
the darkest and lightest parts 
of their life to shine through 
without hesitation.
She is laid bare in the lyrics 
of every song on the 11-track 
record, yet still maintains a sense 
of ownership over her own vices 
and downfalls. It’s an interesting 
balance 
of 
the 
songwriter’s 
proclivity for blunt honesty 
and the tenderness that comes 
with sharing a secret. Lewis is 
not afraid to tell her listeners 
everything she’s been keeping 
inside, but she does it carefully, 

unfurling the pages of her diary 
with expert hands. On The Line 
embraces the messier side of the 
musician’s experiences, but does 
it through a retrospective and 
poetic lens.
The record comes on the 
heels of Lewis’s 2016 breakup 
with her partner of 12 years, 
fellow 
songwriter 
Johnathan 
Rice, a loss that infuses each 
song with a wistful 
reclamation 
of 
independence that’s 
hard to nail down. 
At every step of On 
the Line’s production, 
Lewis continued this 
independence 
and 
self-respect 
some 
songs were produced 
by 
Ryan 
Adams 
before the allegations 
against him were publicized. He 
never finished, and the rest of the 
songs were impeccably produced 
by indie rock’s most reliable man, 
Beck. Despite these bumps in the 
road, On the Line is arguably the 
truest to herself that Lewis has 
been on any solo project, and 
this positive energy worked out 
in spades: the record features 
both Ringo Starr and Tom 
Petty and the Heartbreakers 
keyboardist 
Benmont 
Tench. 
This collection of songs is a win 
for Lewis in every sense of the 
word. It’s obvious from even 
the album artwork, a picture of 
Lewis’s torso in a low-cut dress 
that mimics the same style as 
her 2014 LP The Voyager, that 
she is no longer held back by the 
perception of others. She is who 
she is, and she’s learning and 
growing just like the rest of us.

Jenny Lewis’s whole heart

In the wake of Hollywood’s 
powerful “Time’s Up” movement, 
the classical music world has 
begun to react to the #MeToo 
movement. Famous conductors 
and instrumentalists such as 
Charles Dutoit, James Levine 
and William Preucil have been 
accused of misconduct. Here 
at the University of Michigan, 
music professors David Daniels 
and Stephen Shipps have been 
accused of misconduct.
Few contemporary classical 
music 
composers, 
however, are willing 
to address this difficult 
subject. Enter Evan 
Ware, School of Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
alumni (PhD Theory 
and Composition class 
of 2015) and current 
Assistant Professor of 
Composition at Central 
Michigan University.
This coming Sunday, 
Ware’s “Symphony No. 
2” will be premiered 
at Central Michigan 
University’s 
Staples 
Family 
Concert Hall at 7:30 p.m.. In an 
interview with The Daily, Ware 
spoke about his experiences with 
sexual violence, his attempts to 
process it through music, and 
his thoughts on the #MeToo 
movement in general.
Ware 
is 
remarkably 
comfortable retelling his story 
and explaining how it affected 
him. “I was abused from the 
ages of 8 to 10,” he said. “That 
had a fairly profound effect on 
my life in lots of ways … It’s hard 
to be in intimate relationships. 
(I’m) always wondering when 
the other shoe is going to drop. 
When people are going to ask 
something of (me) that (I’m) not 
actually willing to provide.”
Throughout his early career, 
Ware described treating his 
art as refuge from this abuse. 
During his doctoral studies, 
however, Ware decided to write a 
symphony about his experiences. 
This work, which eventually 
became Ware’s first symphony, 
dealt with the trauma male 
survivors frequently face in a 
society with rigid definitions 
of masculinity and masculine 
emotions.
For many men, “it’s about 
exacting violence and control 
on other people. That’s how you 

restore your manhood,” Ware 
explained. “It’s not about being 
vulnerable and accepting your 
pain and coming to a deeper 
understanding of who you are as 
a human being which is really the 
only way to heal.”
Ware has learned to forgive 
his abuser. In the years since the 
incident, he has never identified 
his abuser publicly. “I don’t hold 
anger against my abuser. That 
person was a kid. And I can’t 
fault them,” he said. “If you’re 
an adult? Well that’s a different 
thing. That’s an abuse of trust.”
As he sat down to write this 
second symphony, stories of 

abuse by the infamous doctor at 
Michigan State University first 
broke in the media. (At Ware’s 
request, we have refrained from 
naming this individual. As Ware 
explains it, we must move the 
conversation past “the infamy of 
the predator” to the “hundreds of 
survivors left behind.”)
“I was distressed by the sheer 
amount of people who were 
affected by the doctor,” Ware 
said. “I remember how dark and 
cold and difficult the world got 
in the years after my own abuse. 
And I thought to myself, ‘there’s 
hundreds of women (that) are 
about to go through this.’”
Ware’s second symphony is his 
attempt to try to speak to these 
victims; to tell them that others 
have experienced what they have 
experienced, and that they can 
get through it.
“A lot of the language that 
we have that surrounds these 
things are about being strong, 
undefeatable and unbreakable,” 
Ware said. “There are also 
moments when you’re not strong. 
And we shouldn’t be afraid of 
them because those moments ... 
are also a part of who you are. 
They’re as beautiful a part of who 
you are as anything else. And so I 
wanted to write a symphony that 
could be with people when they 

weren’t strong.”
Ware also spoke about the 
failure of institutions in many of 
these instances to protect young 
students against these abusers.
“They were not just betrayed 
by the doctor. They were betrayed 
by a university administration 
that callously ignored that this 
was going on,” Ware said. “On 
top of that, some of them their 
parents didn’t believe them.”
Though 
the 
#MeToo 
movement 
has 
changed 
the 
cultural 
conversation 
around 
sexual abuse, Ware cautioned 
that society still had a long way 
to go.
“It’s 
becoming 
more 
acceptable 
to report. But the 
defenses are all still 
the same: always 
blame the victim,” 
Ware 
said. 
“The 
conversation, 
I 
think, has changed 
in 
the 
circle 
of 
survivors. 
There’s 
less shame about it 
because it’s not your 
fault. 
You 
didn’t 
invite it. You didn’t 
do anything to ask 
for this … You were targeted by a 
predator.”
As the #MeToo movement 
moves 
forward, 
furthermore, 
Ware spoke of his fears about 
all those it is potentially leaving 
behind.
“In the broader sense, there’s a 
greater willingness to talk about 
it. People like Ronan Farrow are 
out there doing really good work,” 
Ware said. “I kind of worry that 
it’s (still) pretty delimited by class 
and race boundaries. It’s okay for 
(actors in) Hollywood to do this 
because they have the money to 
sustain (themselves). But there’s 
still the possible fallout if you’re 
a kid from the projects who’s 
abused by your social worker. It’s 
a different story. They have a lot 
less power.”
As a survivor of sexual abuse, 
Ware described the inevitable 
struggle that one eventually faces 
as they work to come to grips 
with what they faced.
“Eventually you have to do the 
hard work of reconnecting. That 
means feeling pain and looking 
in places that scare you,” Ware 
said. “But there’s a great line ... 
that I inscribed in the opening 
page of my symphony. ‘We can 
see that there is something more 
important than what we fear … 
We are more important.’”

With spring on the rise 
and 
April 
fast 
approaching, 
the Ross School of Business 
buzzes with excitement and 
anticipation 
of 
Michigan’s 
second annual Michigan Fashion 
Media Summit. A networking 
phenomena, 
this 
event 
broke 
boundaries 
and 
has only just begun 
revolutionizing 
the meaning of the 
fashion 
industry 
at 
Michigan. 
On 
April 12 in The Ross 
School of Business, 
you can take part 
in a one of a kind 
event 
on 
campus: 
Where 
industry 
meets fashion, where 
passion meets drive, 
and let me tell you, 
it’s going to be chic. 
Similar 
to 
last 
year’s set up, the 2019 
Michigan 
Fashion 
Media 
Summit 
will 
consist 
of a wide range of panelists 
and speakers, all available for 
attendees to not only to hear 
speak, but to interact with as 
well. This year’s summit is 
heavily focused on bringing 
a true diversity in panelist 
backgrounds to attendees. While 
the 45 member team is excited 
for all panelists, some names to 
look forward to include: Jennifer 
Powell, (Digital Brand Strategist 
and Jordan Brand Vice President 
of Design), David Creech and 

John Mezzo (Vice President of 
Human Resources for Retail at 
Michael Kors). 
As they near summit day, 
the excited — and of course, 
fashionable 
— 
co-presidents 
Alexa Moss and Caitlin Forbes 
spoke about their goals when 
selecting panelists and planning 
the event.
“We went about curating the 

speakers in a very strategic way, 
choosing people that not only 
we would want to see in the 
audience, but those who also 
have valuable lessons and lessons 
they want to share,” said Moss. 
This type of collaboration is 
a pillar of the Michigan Fashion 
Media Summit. Whether it be 
with fellow attendees, or through 
panel conversations, the entire 
event offers a business approach 
to fashion, making it a truly one 
of a kind event on campus. 
Co-President Caitlin Forbes 

said, “(We are) showing students 
these amazing options, and what 
they can do with their passions 
and also their career path. We 
want to benefit the students in 
lots of different sectors.” 
In addition to collaboration 
through intentionally curated 
panels, the co-presidents and 
entire team have brought the 
fashion industry to U-M without 
the existence of a 
fashion major at the 
University. 
“Fashion 
is 
so 
much 
more 
than 
just sitting behind 
a sewing machine, 
or 
sitting 
behind 
a 
drawing 
board, 
or 
walking 
down 
a 
runway. 
There’s 
so 
many 
other 
disciplines that go 
into it. Our goal is 
to 
give 
students 
that extra edge in 
fashion, one that they 
don’t get with their 
degree,” said Moss. 
Like 
fashion 
is 
more than a single 
sketch or design, this event is so 
much more than just one day. 
A whole world of opportunity 
exists outside the Michigan 
Fashion Media Summit, and it all 
starts on April 12. 
As 
the 
event 
rapidly 
approaches, 
the 
Michigan 
Fashion 
Media 
Summit 
is 
certainly an event to prepare 
for. 
The 
opportunities 
for 
networking growth within and 
beyond the fashion industry at 
this event are endless for students 
of all career trajectories.

Fashion Summit is here

When Ectomorph is on stage, 
they are no longer people — they are 
self-professed “conduits” to another 
dimension. Their brains construct 
soundscapes that they create with 
their hands. They produce music that 
is sprawling, impossibly intricate, 
formless 
but 
almost 
tangible. 
There 
are 
no 
drum 
machines; 
nothing is pre-recorded. 
In a phrase that might 
seem 
counterintuitive 
to someone unfamiliar 
with techno, Ectomorph 
is 
entirely 
organic, 
producing 
techno 
that demands almost imperceptible 
obedience.
What should first be understood 
about techno is that it is far from the 
pop-infused, drop-heavy electronic 
music that dominates mainstream 
representation of EDM as a whole. It is 
not in-your-face, and it certainly does 
not demand attention. It’s the kind of 
music where you take what you want, 
no more and no less. Techno shows 
do not mirror the popular notion that 
EDM is for young people who take acid 
and wear bright beads — simply put, 
EDM is for everyone who loves to feel a 
beat that makes their bodies follow suit.
In conversation with Ectomorph, 
comprised of artists Brendan “BMG” 
Gillen and Erika from Detroit 
techno collective Interdimensional 
Transmissions, I’ve gained a much 
better understanding of what it means 
to perform techno, let alone produce 
it at all, and how the musical ethos of 
Detroit has influenced it from its birth 
there in the ’80s.
“There’s an organic thing that 
happens when you’re in front of an 
audience, and a crucial thing to us, 
both having come from (the University 
of Michigan’s student radio) WCBN 
— I was a music director, Erika was 
a program director there — having 
experience there when we were there, 
especially during the ’90s. It was a huge 
influence from jazz — like freeform 
jazz,” Gillen said. “The easiest way you 
could say there’s jazz inside of techno 
and house is watching people DJ, 
because they’re improvisers. That kind 
of improvisational nature where the 
idea is shared with the audience, and 
they’re participating with their energy, 
and you respond to that gives a whole 
new context.”
Their knowledge of music of all 
forms, especially pertaining to Detroit, 
is 
nearly 
encyclopedic, 
drawing 
connections to Ann Arbor legends 
MC5 and The Stooges among other 
artists who all share a common 

connection: the unmatched energy of 
live performance.
“The power of (rock music) was 
almost like this religious reverence 
... it’s got this concept where within 
pure high-energy rock ‘n’ roll, they’re 
achieving this advanced, blissed-out 
state of electronic music, where we 
go with our events, where we go with 
our music,” Gillen noted. “It’s hugely 
important to me because these guys 

stood up and did things that were 
absolutely unique, invented things, 
and the rest of the world reacts and still 
reacts. It’s hugely inspirational to me.”
If these examples weren’t enticing 
enough, Gillen went on to include 
Patti Smith in the list: “She’s very 
different from techno, she’s a poet. 
She’s 
absolutely 
articulate 
and 
verbal. Techno doesn’t give you 
much theatrics, but you can see her 
go into this trance-state. And what 
you get when you listen to this stuff, 
I think, that’s where you can see the 
connection.”
And thanks to the University’s 
student 
organization 
MEMCO 
(Michigan 
Electronic 
Music 
Collective), techno and other forms 
of EDM have maintained relevance 
and popularity in Ann Arbor. The club 
offers students multiple opportunities 
each semester to experience this 
unique art form and atmosphere. There 
is no shortage of ways for students to 
get involved — whether it be DJing, 
graphic design, promotion or simply 
attending events — MEMCO’s focus 
is first and foremost providing a safe 
space to dance to music that is vastly 
underrepresented and misunderstood.
In conversation with LSA and Ross 
junior Jordan Stanton, MEMCO’s 
vice president, he illuminated the 
driving force behind the organization’s 
purpose 
on 
campus 
and 
their 
dedication to preserving this music 
in spaces that are comfortable and 
welcoming to all. Most importantly, 
MEMCO hopes to subvert popular 
stereotypes associated with EDM, 
namely misogyny and drug culture.
“Essentially, it’s a community of 
people who, first and foremost, value 
music and consequently want to create 
a space for that kind of music to be 
enjoyed in a safe place that is inclusive 
to everyone,” he explained.
MEMCO is entirely focused on the 
music and making it accessible to the 
Ann Arbor community. Ann Arbor 

can, unfortunately, often feel like a 
small, overwhelmingly white bubble, 
and MEMCO provides important 
visibility to an art form born in 
Detroit by three Black artists that has 
been overtaken by white men. The 
organization not only puts on multiple 
events each semester but also often 
includes themes that celebrate female 
DJs and Black DJs, supporting the 
diversity of techno and its visibility. 
Ectomorph even echoed 
the importance of their 
work on campus.
“I think it’s important 
to be doing the work of 
keeping younger people 
connected to more of 
what’s real about the 
music,” Erika said of the 
organization. “I think 
that’s something that really is lost, or 
more difficult for people to connect 
to, is the history that’s not super well 
known. Making that connection 
between people and showing people 
what the real culture is or what the 
roots are.”
Gillen added, “I feel like MEMCO 
is sharing with people the core essence 
of what this music scene is about. Like 
this music could change your life if 
you experience it in the right place on 
the dance floor. It’s impossible to put 
into words — it only hints at what this 
experience could possibly do.”
Stanton shares this sentiment with 
Gillen about what EDM really means 
to its listeners. 
“We definitely want to make it clear 
to people that we’re a group of people 
who love music, first and foremost.” 
Stanton said. “A MEMCO person 
doesn’t look a particular way. This is a 
group of students, and — I don’t know 
of a lot of clubs where this is true — it 
attracts so many different people. 
Because so many different people 
listen to electronic music. If you listen to 
electronic music and you’re passionate 
about the music you listen to, you might 
as well be a MEMCO member.”
So what should we know about 
Ectomorph before Saturday’s show?
“One thing that’s really interesting 
about the show is that it’s one hundred 
percent analog. It’s all generated live on 
the spot. If we lost electricity it wouldn’t 
keep going. It’s not a recording, there’s 
no samples used. The structure is 
entirely improvised,” Gillen said.
“That goes back to the conduit thing 
you were talking about before. We’re 
creating all the music on the spot,” 
Erika added.
“From 
machines. 
There’s 
no 
computers, no samplers, no drum 
machines,” finished Gillen.
The event is this Saturday beginning 
at 10 p.m. ($10/$5 with student ID) and 
features support from Jordan Stanton 
himself, DJ Horse Jeans, and Cat.

“Gloria 
Bell” 
isn’t 
your 
typical 
coming-of-age 
movie, 
and 
its 
titular 
character 
certainly 
isn’t 
your 
typical 
coming-of-age protagonist. In 
a standard coming-of-age film, 
the protagonist is most likely a 
teenager or a twenty-
something, 
with 
the bulk of their 
life ahead of them. 
They 
experience 
a major life event, 
like a relationship 
or 
a 
death, 
that 
changes them. All 
loose ends are tied 
up by the end, and 
the viewer is left to 
assume that, after they’ve been 
affected by this life-altering 
event, there’s no changing left to 
be done. However, “Gloria Bell” 
understands that this is anything 
but true. People never stop 
changing and people never stop 
growing. In other words, people 
never stop coming of age.
Gloria, played brilliantly by 
Julianne Moore (“Still Alice”), 
is a fifty-something divorced 
mother of two living in a less-
than-ideal apartment. In fact, 
mostly everything in her life 
is less than ideal — her adult 
children no longer need her the 
way they used to, her job leaves 
something to be desired and 
her relationship with her new 
boyfriend is dysfunctional, to 
say the least. Whether we are 
aware of it or not, the reality of 
Gloria’s life is uncomfortable for 

a lot of us. We like to believe that, 
by the time we’re Gloria’s age, 
we’ll have our lives “figured out.” 
The hard, confusing parts of life 
will be behind us. Gloria’s life is 
an example of a life that doesn’t 
go as planned, and the prospect 
of things not going as planned 
is unpleasant to think about. 
Nevertheless, it is the truth. 
“Gloria Bell” is unafraid to bring 

awareness to it through the lens 
of Gloria’s experience.
While 
the 
middle-aged 
focus of “Gloria Bell” may feel 
unapproachable 
to 
younger 
audiences, the film is dedicated 
to creating a universal appeal 
in order to counteract this. For 
one, dating, apartment living and 
partying — all things we associate 
with youth — are significant 
parts of Gloria’s life. The film 
shows that these facets of life are 
in no way restricted to people in 
their twenties and early thirties. 
Additionally, the movie is quite 
funny, largely due to Moore’s 
relentlessly charming on-screen 
presence. Michael Cera (“Scott 
Pilgrim vs. the World”), a well-
known millennial icon, makes a 
few appearances as well. “Gloria 
Bell” also avoids isolating its 
younger viewers by bridging the 

generational gap between older 
and younger people. Although 
the film showcases undeniable 
cultural 
dissimilarities, 
like 
differences in music taste and 
attitudes toward smoking and 
technology, what each generation 
values at its core — family, love 
and human connection — is 
essentially the same. Gloria’s 
desire for meaningful connection 
is at the root of nearly 
all her actions, as 
it is for most of us, 
regardless of age.
All in all, “Gloria 
Bell” is a celebration 
of life’s uncertainty 
in all its stages. It 
knows that nothing 
is 
certain 
and 
that 
everything 
is 
susceptible 
to 
change. In the final shot of the 
movie, Gloria is shown dancing 
fittingly to Laura Branigan’s 
triumphant 
’80s 
anthem 
“Gloria,” with an appearance 
of happiness and freedom on 
her face the audience has never 
seen from her before. She dances 
with her arms outstretched, 
open to all possibilities. Instead 
of wallowing in fear of life’s 
perpetual flux, Gloria basks 
in it and opens herself up to it. 
And while she will inevitably 
continue to change and “come of 
age” after the credits stop rolling, 
it’s clear that the growth she 
has undergone over the course 
of the film is monumental. Her 
personal growth and ultimate 
acceptance of it inspires viewers 
to not only accept the change that 
will certainly come their way, but 
to welcome it with open arms. 

‘Gloria Bell’ rejuvenates

Gloria Bell

Michigan Theatre

Robert Mapplethorpe is an 
enormously complicated figure — 
that’s no less true today than it was 
30 years ago when the attention of 
the art-consuming world was rapt 
with the progress of the Cincinnati 
obscenity 
trial 
surrounding 
his work. Born in 1946, the 
photographer rose to fame in 
the 1970s as an unabashed and 
celebratory visual documentarian 
of New York City’s gay community, 
one of the first prominent artists 
to elevate to the level of museum 
gallery depictions of a group many 
Americans still regarded with 
hostility. Later in the decade, he 
gained still more attention — and in 
the eyes of his detractors, notoriety 
— for often-explicit depictions 
of 
his 
friends 
in 
the 
City’s 
underground BDSM community, 
bringing his technical mastery and 
fascination with classical forms to 
bear upon subjects some welcomed 
and others would have prefered 
were left unaddressed.
In 
the 
midst 
of 
all 
this, 
Mapplethorpe was delving deeply 
into the genres of self-portraiture, 
still life, portraits and the nude, 
honing his craft. In this latter 
category he often foregrounded 
the Black body, cherishing it for its 
beauty and comparing it to bronze 
sculpture. But this treatment of 
his Black subjects (particularly his 
omission of their faces) sometimes 
came under scrutiny: Famously, 
the poet Essex Hemphill offered a 
withering critique of what he saw 
as Mapplethorpe’s fetishization 
of Black men and the museum 
world’s embrace of it. He wrote 
in his essay “Does Your Mama 
Know About Me?” that “what is 
insulting and endangering to Black 
men is Mapplethorpe’s conscious 
determination that the faces, the 
heads, and by extension, the minds 
and experiences of some of his 
Black subjects are not as important 
as close-up shots of their cocks.”
But by the time of his death in 
1989 as a result of complications 
from HIV/AIDS, Mapplethorpe 
had developed into one of the most 
significant photographers of the 
late-20th century. That same year, 
and spilling over into the next, 
Mapplethorpe 
was 
catapulted 
into household-name status when, 
first, the Corcoran Gallery of Art 
cancelled a planned exhibit of 
his series “Robert Mapplethorpe: 
The Perfect Moment” following 
political 
pressure 
from 
social 

conservatives, and then when 
the Contemporary Arts Center in 
Cincinnati and its director, Dennis 
Barrie, were brought to trial on 
charges of obscenity due to their 
booking of the same series. While 
Barrie and the museum were 
ultimately acquitted by jury, the 
trial 
nevertheless 
represented 
a crucial moment in the fights 
surrounding 
artistic 
freedom, 
censorship and funding for the 
National Endowment for the Arts 

that raged throughout the decade. 
Caught up in the vicious opening 
salvos of the culture wars that were 
to consume much of the ’90s, in 
the eyes of many Mapplethorpe’s 
work came to occupy a social 
place similar to Serrano’s “Piss 
Christ” — provocative, stirring, 
simultaneously 
revered 
and 
reviled.
So how do we reckon with an 
artistic legacy like that?
Two weeks ago, the University 
Musical 
Society 
presented 
a 
performance 
attempting 
to 
get at that very question. The 
world premiere of the fully-
staged 
version 
of 
“Triptych 
[Eyes of One on Another],” a 
new work co-commissioned by 
UMS, the performance aimed to 
re-contextualize 
Mapplethorpe’s 
work 
by 
juxtaposing 
his 
photographs 
with 
words 
and 
music in a theatrical context. In so 
doing the creators of “Triptych” 
demonstrated for the millionth time 
the power of collapsing the barriers 
we have erected between art 
forms, and how interdisciplinary 
art opens up fruitful aesthetic and 
social dialogues.
Directed 
by 
theater 
artist 
Kaneza Schaal, and with music 
by Bryce Dessner — a composer, 
performer and curator many know 
as a guitarist in the rock band 
The National — and a libretto by 
multi-disciplinary 
artist 
Korde 

Arrington 
Tuttle, 
“Triptych” 
doesn’t cohere into a narrative 
in the traditional sense. Instead, 
the performance was structured 
(as the name implies) into three 
principal sections, interweaving 
texts 
from 
numerous 
sources 
— including the obscenity trial, 
Mapplethorpe’s close friend Patti 
Smith and Essex Hemphill — into 
a series of songs held together by 
Dessner’s polyglot musical style. 
Throughout the course of all this, 
Mapplethorpe’s photographs were 
projected, 
massively 
enlarged 
and sometimes rapidly changing, 
onto screens above and around 
the performers as lighting effects 
swept across the stage and at times 
even illuminated the audience. This 
interplay of movement and light 
sustained the emotional state of the 
show throughout: A particularly 
striking effect featured a bar of 
searing white light descending 
from the ceiling, as if for a moment 
heaven opened up. In lieu of an 
overt narrative arc, the audience 
was thus presented with fleeting 
impressions 
and 
emotionally 
resonant scenes which feel as if 
they lead naturally from one to 
another but are difficult to string 
together into a plot.
The performance relied upon 
the formidable artistic talents of 
the vocal ensemble Roomful of 
Teeth (who by now certainly needs 
no introduction from me), as well 
as two additional vocalists, Alicia 
Hall Moran and Isaiah Robinson, 
and 
instrumentalists 
affiliated 
with the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance. The vocalists, in addition 
to singing Dessner’s score, took 
on a semi-dramatic role as well, 
repositioning themselves on the 
stage throughout the course of 
the performance, equipped with 
rolling music stands.
“It’s a wonderful and rich 
score,” Brad Wells, the director of 
Roomful of Teeth, told me in an 
interview the afternoon before 
the performance. As I learned 
from him over the course of our 
conversation, the project has been 
in the works for quite a while — the 
possibility of the Teeth and Dessner 
collaborating on a Mapplethorpe 
work was first broached around 
four years ago — and the piece 
finally materialized into a complete 
work in the last several months.

As 
someone 
who 
grew 
up in Silicon Valley during 
its 
most 
profitable 
boom, 
I still have a soft spot for 
it. One thing Silicon Valley 
is brilliant at is wrapping 
capitalist ventures in a shroud 
of idealism and “changing the 
world” (hilariously skewered 
by the creators of the HBO 
show “Silicon Valley”). We 
all wanted to grow up and 
create the next startup. Forget 
working for the government, 
or for a university. The best 
way of improving the world is 
through private venture. It’s 
hard to deny that the Valley 
has had its successes. Its very 
nature has made it susceptible 
to fraud of various degrees, 
and 
the 
most 
egregious, 
absurd and horrifying fraud of 
them all is Theranos.
The story of Therenos is 
inseparable from the story of 
its founder Elizabeth Holmes, 
and 
recent 
documentary 
“The Inventor” places her at 
the forefront. Starting from 
her first days at Stanford, 
the documentary paints a 
portrait of a young woman 
who had a precocious talent 
to mesmerize. So talented, 
in fact, she could convince 
established 
scientists 
and 
investors ranging from Henry 
Kissinger 
to 
prominent 
venture 
capital 
firms 
to 
fund her fledgling company 

whose aim was to create a 
small device that could run 
hundreds of blood tests with a 
small prick of blood.
From 
its 
inception 
in 
2003, 
Theranos’s 
only 
trajectory 
was 
upward. 
Magazine profiles, glowing 
endorsements 
from 
former 
presidents: Elizabeth Holmes 
was a bona fide goddess. 
However, the main problem 
was 
that 
her 
company’s 
product 
never 
worked. 
And nobody could find out. 
“The 
Inventor” 
interviews 
several 
former 
employees-
turned-whistleblowers 
who 
describe the chaos within. A 
chemist describes having to 
reach 
into 
malfunctioning 
machines containing disease-
ridden blood with his bare 
hands. Others describe Sunny 
Balwani, one of Theranos’s 
leading men and Holmes’s 
former 
lover, 
monitoring 
their 
every 
move. 
Blood 
tests supposedly ran by the 
Theranos 
Edison 
machine 
were simply run on Siemens 
machines.
Theranos 
is 
ultimately 
a story of tragedy on too 
many fronts to count. Ian 
Gibbons, 
an 
extremely 
qualified biochemist brought 
on to be chief scientist of the 
company, committed suicide 
days before having to appear 
in 
a 
deposition 
regarding 
patent theft. Tyler Shultz, a 
former research engineer, and 
grandson of Theranos investor 
and former Secretary of State 

George 
Shultz, 
describes 
essentially 
being 
thrown 
under the bus by his own 
grandfather. Whistleblowers 
were 
followed 
by 
private 
investigators and feared for 
their lives.
“The Inventor” uses footage 
from famed documentarian 
Errol Morris’s interview with 
Holmes. As she looks directly 
into the camera, wearing a 
black turtleneck she used 
to wear to emulate her hero 
Steve Jobs, and speaking in 
her artificial baritone, it’s 
difficult to ascertain whether 
she is lying to our faces, 
or whether she genuinely 
believes her innocence.
Dan Ariely, a professor 
of behavioral economics at 
Duke University, points out 
the unique ethos of Silicon 
Valley, in which people put 
out flag posts miles away and 
confidently proclaim “we are 
going to reach it,” without 
ever figuring out how. People 
who don’t believe it are pushed 
aside 
as 
“old-fashioned,” 
needing to be “disrupted.” 
But perhaps disruption isn’t 
all that it’s panned out to be. 
Perhaps forethought, research 
and genuine understanding 
are actually more valuable. 
One can only hope that the 
story of Theranos teaches 
everyone 
who 
works 
in 
technology the lesson that 
“build fast and break things” 
is not always the answer.

Theranos documentary is
is pure terror and tragedy

‘That’s the way it is’: Sheryl Szady’s fight against the status quo

In observance of Women’s History 
Month, The Daily’s sports section is 
launching its second annual series 
aimed at telling the stories of female 
athletes, coaches and teams at the 
University from the perspective of 
the female sports writers on staff. 
We continue the series with this 
story from Daily Sports Editor Paige 
Voeffray.
Women’s athletics has come 
a long way since the first official 
varsity Michigan teams took the 
field in 1973. So much so that it’s 
easy to take what the women have 
today for granted. Each team is 
equipped with multiple coaches, 
trainers and nutritionists to stay in 
peak condition. All the athletes are 
given stacks of new clothes every 
season to make sure they’re looking 
their best. They’re even flown all 
over the country to compete against 
the best teams.
This is common practice — 
almost expected.
But it wasn’t always this way.
There 
were 
many 
women 
that came before these athletes 
that fought and pushed for what 
they deserved. But there was one 
woman in particular who couldn’t 
seem to let it go and wasn’t afraid to 
take on important people, and every 
woman who wears a block ‘M’ on 
their chest has her to thank.
Sheryl Szady didn’t want any 
attention. She didn’t want to cause 
any issues. She just wanted to play.
And because of that, Michigan 
athletics has never been the same.
***
Szady attended Michigan from 
1970-1974 and played on the club 
team for field hockey and basketball. 
There wasn’t practice equipment or 
warm-up uniforms, and only some 
teams would have a volunteer coach 
if they were lucky. And that might 
have been suitable for a while, but 
Szady looked around at the other 
universities’ varsity programs and 
wondered how Michigan had fallen 
so far behind.
The club teams would play the 
varsity programs from these other 
universities, but their conditions 
were nothing alike.
“We were playing the varsity 
teams at Eastern, Western, Central, 
Michigan State, Adrian, as a club 
team,” Szady said. “I mean I’m 
calling the varsity coach as a club 
team being like, ‘Can we schedule 
a game?’ And they’re picking the 
day, I mean I had like no clout. They 
were like, ‘Thank you for playing 
us.’ ”
Szady recalls washing her own 
uniform after every game, sharing 
12 rolls of athletic tape over a 
season, and even driving across the 
state in a teammate’s roommate’s 
sister’s friend’s car. It seems trivial, 
but this was a big deal to these 
women.
“We don’t want more. We don’t 
want to take from (the men),” said 
Michigan softball coach, women’s 
athletics advocate and essentially 
the face of women’s athletics at 
Michigan, Carol Hutchins.
“Nobody ever wanted to take 
away 
their 
opportunity. 
We 
just wanted to have the same 
opportunity. And funny how they 
found a way to fund it because you 
can find a way to fund whatever you 
think is important.”
This situation wasn’t ideal, but 
for the time being, it worked — until 
it didn’t.
In the March of her junior year, 
Szady began to call her usual set of 
coaches to schedule games for the 
next season, but they all turned her 
down. Her friend Linda Laird, the 
women’s club basketball manager, 
experienced the same thing.
“Finally, the field hockey coach 
from Eastern called me back and 
said ‘Sheryl, nobody’s going to 
play you this year,’ Szady said. 
“We decided to blacklist Michigan 
until the University elevated their 
women’s program.’ ”
For Szady, the next step was 
clear — elevate the program.
***
For most people, taking a club 
team to the caliber of a varsity 
team would be a daunting task. 
Many wouldn’t even know where 
to start. Title IX had been passed in 
1972, however the implementation 
guidelines weren’t written until 
1975, so Title IX wasn’t available for 
Szady to plead her case.
So as a junior, Szady went after 
the one thing that makes all athletic 
departments run: money.
This would go further than a 
couple of fundraisers. Szady went 
to the Office of Development and 
asked to have Women’s Athletics to 

be added as a solicitation option on 
the donation cards.
“My thought, at the time, was 
that if we had enough money, we 
could run our program at a varsity-
type level,” Szady said. “Which is 
overly simplistic, because you need 
university support.”
Through her efforts, Szady met 
with Henry Johnson, the vice 
president of Student Affairs.
Her initial plan was to ask 
Johnson for funding, but when 
other schools decided to stop 
playing Michigan, she knew they 
needed a varsity program.
“So we talked and he said to 
come back in a week, he was going 
to get me an appointment to talk to 
Robben Fleming, 
the 
president,” 
Szady said. “And 
I 
thought, 
‘OK, 
I just talked to a 
vice 
President, 
I can talk to the 
president.’ ”
While Johnson 
couldn’t get Szady 
on 
Fleming’s 
calendar, 
he 
secured 
another 
opportunity: 
presenting 
this 
situation to the Board of Regents.
Szady and Laird knew they 
needed to impress the group, so they 
came in their best outfits and had 
their materials already prepared. 
However, there was another group 
of students presenting before the 
women. They were requesting 
that Jewish holidays be considered 
when 
making 
the 
academic 
calendar, but their methods weren’t 
so well received.
“They got up there and were 
banging on the table,” Szady said. 
“Good point, wrong delivery. I 
thought, ‘Oh good, they’re just 
going to love hearing from two 
more students.’ ”
Each presenter was given five 
minutes to speak, and the women 
were never cut off and told their 
whole story. And it worked.
Fleming asked Marie Hartwig, 
a professor of Physical Education 
and long-time advocate of women’s 
sports and recreation, to head 
a committee to study women’s 
intercollegiate 
athletics. 
The 
committee began in April, and by 
the end of June recommended that 
six women’s sport club teams be 
elevated to varsity. 
“Do you know how fast that is?” 
Szady said. “Fleming received the 
report and approved it by the end of 
July. Marie Hartwig called me and 
said, ‘I just received a message from 
Fleming’s office, he directed me to 
start women’s varsity athletics this 
fall.’ ”
***
At 
first, 
Szady 
and 
her 
teammates enjoyed some perks that 
they weren’t accustomed to. They 
travelled in University vans, even if 
the coach and a senior had to be the 
drivers, and they were given meal 
money.
One evening, the team went to 
Big Boy after a game. The women 
were given $3.50 for a meal, and so 
after ordering the special for $2.50, 
they all had one dollar remaining. 
Szady feared that if they didn’t 
spend the money they would never 
see it again. So each athlete ordered 
two pies for dessert.
“Here comes these two trays 
with these huge pies,” Szady 
said.“We catch the coaches going, 
‘What the hell is going on?’ and we 
responded, ‘We’re spending our 

money.’ ”
It was a change of pace to what 
they were used to, but the women 
enjoyed it while they could.
They still didn’t have complete 
uniforms, scholarships or media 
coverage, but they knew change 
didn’t happen overnight.
After a gymnast fell of the 
balance beam and dislocated her 
elbow, the women were finally 
granted an athletic trainer.
“Much progress was reactive 
in nature,” Szady said. “So we 
stumbled into progress, but if it cost 
money, it didn’t happen for a long 
time.”
It was Szady’s firm belief that 
athletic director Don Canham tried 
to ignore women’s 
athletics in hopes 
that it would go 
away. It didn’t.
The 
women 
continued to see 
differences 
in 
what they received 
compared to the 
men. The women 
were 
still 
only 
playing 
in-state 
rivals, 
while 
the men had a national schedule. 
The 
women 
would 
receive 
small scholarships, but only for 
the semester that they were in 
season, while the men received 
full scholarships. If the men made 
a postseason run, the athletic 
department and the NCAA covered 
the costs, whereas the women 
had to make their case for athletic 
department funds, if they were 
good enough to make it that far. 
Hutchins 
remembers 
having 
teams sell programs at football 
games or clean Crisler Center after 
concerts to earn the extra money 
for the softball team.
“Title IX had passed in ’72 
and you saw in the mid and late 
’70s people realizing that they 
had to have athletics for women,” 
Hutchins said. “They had to fund 
and support teams or they were 
going to face federal loss of funding, 
because that’s the penalty of not 
complying with Title IX. Lawsuits 
were starting to happen, so having 
a team doesn’t mean you support it. 
It means you just have it.”
But Szady wanted just one more 
thing: varsity awards.
Szady received a lot of pushback 
from Canham, but she wanted the 
same varsity awards that the men 
received, and she wanted the same 
block ‘M’ on those awards as well. 
She was told she was on her own — 
a familiar refrain.
Szady had petitioned the student 
government for a seat on the 
Board in Control of Intercollegiate 
Athletics, and she was quickly 
granted a spot. Canham assigned 
her to the Board committee on 
Varsity Awards. Ultimately, the 
committee agreed on a new 
schedule of awards for both men 
and women: first a jacket, then a 
plaque, blanket and finally a watch. 
 
However, the block ‘M’ on the 
varsity awards was a different 
matter. 
A motion for varsity awards for 
men and women with the same 
block ‘M’ was tabled by Canham 
when it appeared it would be 
close to passing. The vote occured 
six weeks later in June 1975. In 
the meantime, letters were sent 
by Athletics to all the Michigan 
letterwinners — the men of the 
M-Club.
The letters, one from Bill Mazer, 

then president of the M-Club, and 
the other signed by then basketball 
coach Johnny Orr, and football 
coach Bo Schembechler expressed 
similar sentiments.
“The letter read, ‘You can’t allow 
them to give the same Block ‘M’out, 
it’s bad enough we’re giving them 
one at all. How can you let them 
give the same Block ‘M’ for which 
you bled and sweat on the fields of 
Michigan for. They want to give 
your Block ‘M’ to synchronized 
swimmers and softball players.’ ” 
Szady recalled.
At this time, Michigan didn’t 
even have a softball team.
The letter went on to say that 
if anyone had any issues with 
this 
proposed 
vote, 
to 
voice 
their concerns to 
the 
committee 
members 
and 
gave 
out 
their 
home 
addresses. 
Szady could fill 
a paper grocery 
bag two-thirds of 
the way full with 
the 
letters 
she 
received.
Szady remembers one letter 
in particular that still sticks with 
her. A doctor wrote to share how 
displeased he was with what she 
was trying to do, and wasn’t shy 
about voicing his thoughts. But 
at the end of the letter, he drew a 
picture telling her what kind of 
block ‘M’ she should get — a bra 
with the ‘M’ in the cleavage.
On the day of the vote, Szady 
traveled to Ann Arbor. She had 
missed the evening news the 
night before, but Al Ackerman, an 
NBC Detroit sports anchor, had 
stated that if Michigan didn’t give 
the women the same block ‘M’, 
he would never report another 
Michigan score on his broadcast 
again.
This was information Szady 
wished she had known when 
Canham called her into his office 
an hour before the vote. 
Canham immediately asked her 
what she wanted. She explained 
she wanted the same block ‘M’ for 
women as the men. He countered 
with a blue ‘M’, an old english ‘M’, 
anything but the yellow block ‘M’. 
Again, he asked, ‘What do you 
want?’
“Now in retrospect, I should 
have said four tickets on the 50 
(yard-line) for life,” Szady joked.
Instead, she didn’t waiver, and 
told Canham she would take her 
chances with the Board and left 
for the meeting. The vote passed 
nearly unanimously with all but 
one voting against, and the women 
were going to get their block ‘M’.
Months 
later, 
when 
Szady 
received her letter jacket in the 
mail, she opened it to find a jacket 
with a small, square, orange-
colored block ‘M’ — not what she 
had fought for. 
“And so I call up Marie 
(Hartwig) and I say ‘What is this?’ 
And she said ‘It’s the jacket you’re 
getting.’ Meaning she’s not fighting 
for this. She fights Canham and 
she’s probably losing her job,” 
Szady said. “And I said, ‘That’s not 
right.’
“And she said, ‘That’s the way it 
is.’ ”
***
Even 
when 
Phyllis 
Ocker 
became 
athletic 
director, 
she 
couldn’t do anything to change the 
letters until Canham’s influence 

was completely gone. The culture 
he created was so entrenched that 
no progress could be made.
“I remember the jacket. I used 
to hand them out to my student 
athletes. They were ugly,” Hutchins 
said. “And in their own right, it’s not 
that they weren’t nice looking, but 
then (the men) had the letter jacket, 
and then we had that.”
It wasn’t until 1991-92 that the 
athletic director at the time, Jack 
Weidenbach, started to give women 
the same block ‘M’ on the same 
leather-sleeved jacket as the men.
For forty years, she talked 
to anyone she could. She wrote 
letters and made phone calls, but 
to no avail. It wasn’t until she 
ran into current 
athletic 
director 
Warde 
Manuel 
after a women’s 
basketball 
game 
that things really 
started to be put 
in 
motion. 
She 
approached 
him 
about her idea for 
giving 
18 
years 
worth of athletes 
the 
appropriate 
jackets, and Manuel said that it was 
definitely going to happen.
Szady wouldn’t believe it until she 
saw it. While out to dinner in April 
2016, she received the long-awaited 
email from Manuel acknowledging 
the fundamental role played by the 
early women letterwinners, and the 
re-issuing of their varsity jackets 
with today’s varsity jacket. Only 
then did she share her joy with all 
the other restaurant diners.
After the initial wave, the 
University received 120 orders of 
new jackets. The University was 
pleased with itself, but Szady wasn’t 
satisfied.
After doing her own outreach, 
the University received 647 jacket 
orders. But by her estimates, 881 of 
the 900 women had been contacted.

Her work was done. But she 
wasn’t satisfied.
Szady organized for as many 
‘Jacket Gals’, as Szady and the 
women refer to themselves, to get 
together at a football game. About 
300 women came from all over 
the country with their families to 
celebrate, and the icing on the cake 
was they were going to hold the 
banner before the start of the game.
Until they weren’t. Weeks before 
the game, Szady received a phone 
call explaining how there were too 
many Jacket Gals and that they 
would be bigger than the marching 
band. Szady knew the women 
would be crushed. Szady also 
suspected that if they were football 
players, they would be holding the 
banner on the field.
So she did what she does best — 
let right win out.
“Meeting 
with 
Athletics, 
I 
said, ‘You know people are going 
to be really mad about this. They 
bought tickets, they’ve got airplane 
tickets, they got hotel rooms and 
they expect to be recognized 
on the field,’ ” Szady said. “And 
Letterwinners M club just went 
very silent. And the guy in Athletics 
said ‘Sheryl, people are still calling 
saying why do we even have women 
on the football field.’
“And I couldn’t believe he 
repeated that.”
After the Jacket Gals shared 
their concerns, the issue was 
resolved with all 300 Jacket Gals 
honored on the field at halftime. 
As Szady led the 300 in their new 
jackets with the right ‘M’ out of the 
tunnel onto the field, she finally felt 
like all her hard work had paid off.
***
There were times when Szady 
never thought the conditions would 
improve. Everyone seemed so set 
in their ways that progress seemed 
unlikely.
Even in current times she still 
faces struggles that people wouldn’t 
expect. But when she sees what the 
female athletes have now, she loves 
it.
“I know a lot of women, and 
Sheryl Szady’s one of them, who 
fought like hell for that. And went 
through a lot of shit — for lack of 
a better word — from people who 
treated her poorly,” Hutchins said. 
“I know a lot of people who were 
fired in that era and to this day are 
still fired when they bring up the 
inequities that still exist. Because 
there still are inequities.
“We’ve come so far and it’s taken 
a lot of people who are vigilant. 
And people have talked about Title 
IX that we don’t need it anymore, 
because ‘Oh look at what you 
women have.’ I say you don’t take 
down speed limit signs, because 
people will start driving 90. You 
have to have a law because we need 
boundaries. … If they were going to 
do the right thing, they would have 
done it then.”
Szady and Hutchins can both 
agree that women’s athletics still 
has strides to make. Szady has some 
more ideas for how the athletic 
department could change, but she 
won’t rest until things are equal.
Truly equal.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — For all the 

highs of this season, the end wasn’t 
especially hard to see coming.

Back in January, Michigan sat on 

top of the world. Undefeated. The 
best start in program history. The 
driver’s seat in the Big Ten. The 
driver’s seat for a No. 1 seed in the 
NCAA Tournament. Maybe the No. 
1 overall ranking. Maybe a return 
trip to the Final Four. Maybe more.

But despite a top-ranked defense, 

despite a coach on par with any and 
despite an identity that made losing 
seem like an incomprehensible 
option, there were the Wolverines, 
playing out the season’s last minutes 
as a formality in a blowout loss. The 
reserves came on with 1:17 to go as 
redshirt junior wing 
Charles 
Matthews 

stood 
at 
the 
free 

throw line wearing 
the expression of a 
man at the end of the 
road.

Michigan’s season 

ended on Thursday 
night with a 63-44 
loss to Texas Tech 
and, while the Red 
Raiders looked ahead 
to the Elite Eight 
on Saturday, the Wolverines sat 
on their bench, heads covered in 
towels so TV cameras might not 
catch the tears.

Afterwards, 
his 
eyes 
still 

wet and his towel still adorned, 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
could only offer platitudes at a 1-of-
19 3-point shooting performance 
that punctuated the Wolverines’ 
offensive struggles.

“We had a lot of open looks,” 

Poole said. “Lot of them didn’t go 
in. It happens.”

Against a Texas Tech defense as 

good as their own, the Wolverines 
had to score some points to win. 
They struggled to consistently meet 
that goal all year and on Thursday, 
failed to do so again. Michigan 

coach John Beilein estimated his 
team had six or eight good looks 
from outside, “and we didn’t make 
any of them.”

Initially, 
it 
seemed 
the 

Wolverines may not 
have needed to.

Eight minutes into 

the game, the two 
teams had five made 
field goals and six 
turnovers 
between 

them. If you are some 
kind 
of 
basketball 

sadist, 
the 
Honda 

Center might have felt 
like a five-star resort. 
For everyone else, it 
was a crucible.

Texas Tech led by eight at the 

half, enough that the Wolverines 
went into the locker room feeling 

like they just needed 
a couple shots to go 
down.

They 
never 
did. 

And, when the dam 
finally 
opened 
for 

the Red Raiders, it 
opened for good.

Davide 
Moretti 

keyed a 10-2 Red 
Raider run in the 
opening minutes of 
the second half, and 
with it, the end of 

the Wolverines’ season. The Red 
Raider guard hit Matt Mooney 
with a behind the 
back pass for three. 
Then he found Tariq 
Owens 
for 
a 
two-

hand jam on a lob. To 
cap it off, he nailed a 
transition 
3-pointer 

of his own, extending 
the lead to 18 points 
which, coincidentally, 
was as many as the 
Wolverines 
had 

scored by that point.

“I think we had a positive mindset 

coming out of (the half) and they hit 
us with a 7-0 run out of the half,” 
said assistant coach Luke Yaklich. 
“It got up to 13, 15 real quick. The 

amount of pressure that you put 
on your offensive possessions from 
that point forward, for the rest of 
the game, it was big. We did not 
make shots.”

Out of the ensuing 

timeout, 
Michigan 

left Owens off a pick-
and-roll and, again, 
the big man threw 
down a dunk worthy 
of his size. On the 
bench, John Beilein 
sat, helpless, the heel 
of his palm resting 
on his chin.

For the remainder, 

the 
Wolverines 

helplessly waited for 

the clock to run out on a season 
that once held endless potential. 
All season, Michigan looked for a 
bucket-getter who could save it in 
just that situation. On Thursday, 
Ignas Brazdeikis led the team in 
scoring with 17 points, most of 
them after the game was out of 
hand. Matched up against a defense 
equal to its own, the Wolverines 
fell into the same listless offensive 
basketball that defined much of 
their struggles this season.

“We tried our best to get ready in 

two days for, even a different type 
of switching defense,” Beilein said. 
“But it wasn’t enough to get ready 
for a team that’s been doing that for 
100 practices and 36 games. They 

were just better at 
it.”

Michigan took 19 

3-pointers and the 
only make came with 
22 seconds to go — far 
too little and far too 
late. It never found 
a way to get to the 
basket against the 
Red Raiders’ defense 
and, to boot, turned 
it over 14 times.

“We were really good,” Beilein 

said of the season. “Tonight was, 
we were not.”

And now, the Wolverines have 

six months to think about it.

The night nothing 

went right

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Amid an eerie 

silence, bowed heads and tear-filled 
eyes, one telling phrase rung through 
the Michigan locker room:

“Bad day to have a bad day.”
It came from Jordan Poole. It came 

from Jon Teske. It came from Isaiah 
Livers.

But most of all, it came from Luke 

Yaklich, the Wolverines’ defensive 
mastermind of an assistant coach who 
watched his carefully curated pièce de 
résistance get shredded in a humiliating, 
63-44, season-ending loss at the hands 
of Texas Tech.

The phrase came from Dan Muller, 

the head coach at Illinois State during 
Yaklich’s four-year tenure in Normal, 
Ill. Muller, though, never had to use 
it to explain the sudden end of a team 
that had started its season 17-0, nearly 
ascended to the nation’s top ranking 
and then spent the rest of the year in the 
top-10.

Late Thursday night in Anaheim, 

Yaklich had to do exactly that. The 
explanation included crediting the Red 
Raiders — “Because Texas Tech’s really 
good,” he responded when asked why 
the Wolverines couldn’t climb back into 
the game — as well as a requisite dose 
of frustration: “The rubber ball didn’t 
hit the iron rim the right way for us 
tonight.”

But to those around Yaklich, the 

“why” doesn’t matter. As he spoke, 
Zavier Simpson aggressively did not. 
The junior point guard sat in Yaklich’s 
shadow with his head buried in the 
same March Madness towel that was 
broadcast to the nation moments earlier 
as he rested on the Michigan bench, 
tears forming in his eyes.

This time, his face was buried deep in 

his hands, facing his locker but looking 
straight into the ground, only his back 
visible to the room. No matter his 
attempts to hide them, his stifled tears 
spread through the room.

Back on the court, Simpson kept 

his poise for as long as possible, 
broadcasting the message of “We’re 
gonna win this game” through every 

Wolverines’ huddle.

On this night, though, that was 

wishful thinking.

“It was a little helpless at times,” said 

head coach John Beilein.

As Michigan charged out of the 

halftime tunnel, mired in a precarious 
24-16 hole, the Wolverines took their 
spots for their midgame shootaround. 
Moments later, they fired five balls up 
in unison. All five clanged harmlessly to 
the ground.

For Michigan, it was just that kind of 

night.

After the buzzer sounded to signal 

the resumption of play, the night only 
worsened. Junior center Jon Teske went 
to the line with a chance to start the half 
on the right foot and cut into the deficit.

An hour later, he sat emotionless in 

the Wolverines’ locker room, reflecting 
on a first-half shot that would have tied 
the game.

Only it hadn’t. For a split second, 

the ball was down and the score was 
knotted at 13. Then, it flew out of the 
cylinder, just like each of Michigan’s 
first 18 3-point attempts.

“Yeah, I mean, we had a lot of great 

looks. Mine was three-quarters of the 
way down, not even halfway down,” 
Teske said. “... Their defense bothered 
us a little bit, but our shots weren’t 
falling.

“As coach Yak said, ‘It was a bad day 

to have a bad day.’ ”

The rebound, though, landed in 

freshman forward Ignas Brazdeikis’ 
hands. The Wolverines wouldn’t tie the 
game, but they would cut it to one on a 
putback that Brazdeikis could hit in his 
sleep.

But not on this night. On this night, 

that putback rimmed out, just as Teske’s 
three had. On this night, the ensuing 
loose ball caromed off Brazdeikis’ 
arms and out of bounds. On this night, 
Texas Tech’s Matt Mooney fired off a 
turnaround three two possessions later, 
striking the backboard just as the shot-
clock turned to 1 and dropping through 
the net a split-second later.

“We had a lot of open looks,” Poole 

said. “A lot of them didn’t go in. That 
happens. I’m just gonna use the quote, 
‘It was a bad day to have a bad day.’ “
