Students to compete
for overseas study as
Rhodes, Marshall,
Mitchell scholars
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily Staff Reporter
Six University students have
been nominated to represent the
leaders and best overseas.
The University Provost's Coun-
cil on Student Honors has nomi-
nated six students for three of
academia's most prestigious schol-
arships - the Rhodes Scholarship
at Oxford University, the Marshall
Scholarship, which places students
in the United Kingdom and the
Mitchell Scholarship in Ireland.
The University's nominees are
LSA senior Ana Guay, LSA gradu-
ate Zeinab Khalil, LSA senior
Stephanie Leitzel, LSA graduate
David Moore, LSA senior James
Nadel, and Kevin Bain, a Business
senior with dual enrollment in
LSA. These students will compete
with thousands of others for one

of the few coveted spots offered by
these elite scholarship organiza-
tions.
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack will host a reception Monday
where the nominated students
will speak. Students interested in
applying for the scholarships inthe
future are also invited to attend.
Leitzel was the only University
student nominated for the Mitch-
ell Scholarship. Leitzel said pro-
spective students first apply to a
University committee that selects
the nominees.
"You prepare for it for quite
a while," she said. "You apply to
Michigan first and there's a com-
mittee at Michigan that selects
people for the Rhodes, Marshall,
and Mitchell."
Leitzel decided to apply to the
Mitchell Scholarship because of
her fascination with Irish culture
and history. The Mitchell Schol-
arship awards as many as 12 win-
ners per funded year of study at
any university in Ireland. Leitzel
said the scholarship would be a
"perfect fit" for her, as she hopes
to become a historian with a spe-

historic, Ann Arbor-favorite "It went well; people seemed

to like it," Magner said.
Following 60 years at its
South Division Street location,
Blimpy Burger was displaced
in 2013 after the University
purchased the property for $1.5
million to build the Munger
Graduate Residence Hall.
The graduate residence hall
was funded in large part by a
$110 million donation from Uni-
versity alum Charles Munger, a
real estate mogul. At the time,
the donation was the largest
in University history, though it

was topped a few months later
by a $200 million donation
from fellow real estate magnate
Stephen Ross. The residence
hall, projected to cost $188 mil-
lion and house 600 graduate
students, is expected to open in
fall 2015.
Magner said moving Blimpy
Burger into its new home took
longer than he had originally
hoped. After looking into a new
location that didn't work out,
Magner signed the lease for the

Owdziej was appointed to

President Barack Obama, accompanied by Attorney General Eric Holder, speaks in the State Dining Room of the White
House in Washington, Thursday to announce Holder is resigning.
Eric Holder to step down
from post as Attorney Gen

Replacement to be
named in coming
months
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Eric Holder, America's first
black attorney general and an
unflinching champion of civil
rights in enforcing the nation's
laws, announced his resigna-
tion Thursday after leading the
Justice Department since the
first days of President Barack
Obama's term. He is the fourth-
longest-serving attorney general
in U.S. history.
Holder, the administration's
point man on the civil rights
investigation into the police
shooting of an unarmed 18-year-
old in Ferguson, Missouri, won't
leave until a replacement is con-
firmed, which means he could
remain in office for months.
Senate Republicans signaled
they were preparing for a con-
firmation fight after years of
battles with Holder. Said Senate
GOP leader Mitch McConnell:
"I will be scrutinizing the presi-
dent's replacement nominee to
ensure the Justice Department

finally returns to prioritizing
law enforcement over partisan
concerns."
In an emotional ceremony at
the White House, Obama called
Holder "the people's lawyer"
and credited him with driving
down both the nation's crime
and incarceration rate - the
first time they have declined
together in more than 40 years.
"Through it all, he's shown a
deep and abiding fidelity to one
of our most cherished ideals as a
people, and that is equal justice
under the law," Obama said.
Holder responded by speak-
ing of how he was inspired as a
boy by Robert Kennedy's leader-
ship on civil rights at the Justice
Department, his voice choking
as he expressed his thanks to
Obama and his own family. "You
got through it," Obama could be
heard telling Holder as the audi-
ence stood and applauded.
In a speech earlier this week,
Holder described the dual per-
spective he brought to the job
and how it applied to the Fergu-
son shooting, in which a young
black man was shot and killed
by a white policeman. He said
he had the utmost respect for

police as a former prosecutor
and the brother of an officer.
But, he added, "As an African-
American man who has been
stopped and searched by police
in situations where such actions
were not warranted, I also carry
with me an understanding of
the mistrust that some citizens
harbor."
Holder told The Associ-
ated Press in an interview that
he's not sure whether the Jus-
tice Department will finish its
investigation into the shooting
before he leaves. "I don't want
to rush them," Holder said. He
said once out of office, he will
direct attention to "issues that
have animated me" during his
tenure, including criminal jus-
tice and civil rights.
"If you asked me what my big-
gest regret was, I would say that
it was the failure to pass any
responsible and reasonable gun
safety legislation after the shoot-
ings in Newtown," Holder said.
He said he thought in the after-
math of the school shootings
in Connecticut that the nation
would embrace change that was
"not radical but really reason-
able" on gun ownership.

Nadel, who is the managing

his interest in many different sub-

Nadel said. "It definitely allows
you to see a lot of different his-

to what most people think, Mag-

business comes from Ann Arbor
locals. He said the new location
will still draw plenty of townies,
and he hopes students will still
come out.
"Our first two weeks of Sep-
tember (at the old location), when

South Quad-and West Quad had
mostly freshmen in them, except
for football Saturdays, are two of
the slowest weeks of the year,"
Magner said. "The reason is, the
townies stay away because they
think students are back and traf-
fic and parking is worse the first
few weeks of school."
Magner said his staff, about
one-third of which carried over
from the old location, may have
another "super-soft" launch with
another small group of guests
before the full open, which is
expected to be the end of next
week.

Emergency Manager
Kevyn Orr to
remain involved in
bankruptcy trial
DETROIT (AP) - The day-
to-day operations of Detroit's
city government are back in the
hands of its elected mayor and,
city council.
State-appointed emergency
manager Kevyn Orr on Thursday
signed one of his final orders and
relinquished control of the city
after 18 months of state over-
sight.
"The city is more than ready,"
Orr told reporters before sign-
ing order 42 putting the nine-
member council and Mayor
Mike Duggan back in charge of
Detroit's finances, police depart-
ment and other facets of city gov-
ernment. "This is really a good
day for the city. We have a little
bit more to go, but this is the
right thing to do."
Orr was appointed in March
2013 to manage Detroit's trou-
bled finances, and he took the city
into the largest municipal bank-
ruptcy in U.S. history. His exit
becomes effective if and when
federal Judge Steven Rhodes
approves the city's restructuring
plan in bankruptcy court. The
bankruptcy plan would wipe out

$7 biliion of Detroit's $12 billion
in long-term, unsecured debt
while restructuring city servic-
es.
The orderly transition of
responsibilities from Orr to the
city reflects the continuing coop-
eration between Detroit and
Lansing, Gov. Rick Snyder said
in a statement.
"Together, we have confront-
ed problems that have lingered
for decades," Snyder said. "There
have been difficult decisions
and sacrifices. Hard work is still
ahead of us. We remain focused
on improving the quality of life
for all residents and building a
strong and sustainable financial
foundation for the city."
Orr's contract expires this
weekend. He still keeps the title
of emergency manager, but his
duties primarily will involve
shepherding Detroit through the
bankruptcy.
"We'll know where we are a
year or two from now andwheth-
er it was worth it," he said of tak-
ing Detroit into bankruptcy.
Order 42 returns "democracy
back to the city of Detroit," Dug-
gan said during a press briefing
after the council approved its
resolution.
Orr, Duggan and council-
members spent three days hash-
ing out the deal. Sticking points
involved financial concerns tied

up in bankruptcy court, includ-
ing a pending bond issue -that
required the city to have an
emergency manager.
"We had a lot of questions,"
said Council President Brenda
Jones. "We do not want to stand
in the way of the bankruptcy
proceedings."
Orr, who gradually has been
returning responsibilities to
elected officials, is still expected
to testify during the bankruptcy
trial, which is scheduled to last
until mid-October.
He and his team have reached
deals that will pay most of the
city's creditors far less than they
are owed. An agreement with
the state, businesses and founda-
tions keeps pension' cuts down
while preventing the sale of city-
owned artwork to satisfy some
of the debt. The restructuring
plan also sets aside $1.7 billion
to improve police, fire and other
city services.
When Orr took over the city
was all but broke. Tax revenue
was not enough to cover spend-
ing and the city's bills. There was
no money to pay off $5.7 billion
in retiree health care obligations
or $3.5 billion in pension liabili-
ties. City services were poor and
an under-manned and under-
equipped police force struggled
to keep the crime rate down.

Like Republican Gov. Rick Sny-

increased investment in science,
technology, engineering and
math fields.
Climate Change and the
Environment
Though outside interest groups
have focused significant atten-
tion on the controversial piling
of petroleum coke in the Detroit
River, which theyclaimnegatively
impacts heart and lung health,
there are other important climate
and environmental issues to con-
sider.
"(Peters) believes that climate
change poses a real threat to our
Great Lakes and agricultural
producers, but it also presents
a big economic opportunity for
Michigan to continue leading in
clean energy solutions," Alsawah
wrote. To accomplish this, the
congressman supports the expan-
sion of investment and tax credits
in clean energy manufacturing
and production.
Women's Issues
The Peters campaign and
its allied support groups have
emphasized the wide gap

between Land and the congress-
man on several women's issues.
Peters supports the pro-choice
movement and has backed leg-
islation to reverse the Supreme
Court's June Hobby Lobby deci-
sion, which stated that corpora-
tions should not be required to
provide insurance that covers
the purchase of contraceptives.
Peters is also a strong support-
er of equal pay for equal work,
which has been an emphasis for
Democrats across the board this
midterm season.
Foreign Policy
The potential move from the
House to the Senate would force
Peters to take on a more promi-
nent role in foreign policy forma-
tion, as his work in the House
has focused largely on financial
issues. Based on his experience
in the Navy Reserve, Peters
views sending American troops
to war as "the toughest decision
a Member of Congress could
make," Alsawah wrote. Peters
opposes deploying ground troops
in Iraq, Syria and other areas of
conflict. He instead favors using
airstrikes as well as equipping
and training moderate Arab forc-
es to combat the advance of the
Islamic State.

Hamas, Fatah reach -deal
during Egypt negotiations


Ann Arbor matched 25 percent of
the funds from CMAQ. The Uni-
versity's Planet Blue initiative
is ArborBike's title sponsor, and
pledged $600,000 over its first
three years.
Despite Michigan's harsh win-
ters, Seyfarth said Michigan's
climate wouldn't affect business
for ArborBike. CEC will be clos-
ing down and storing the stations
duringthewinter and reinstalling
them in April.
"We are exploring the possibil-
ity of leaving them out in future
years," she said. "In other bike
share communities that have
snow, some are starting to leave
them out all year due to popular-
ity."
Public Policy senior Bobby
Dishell, Central Student Gov-
ernment president, said CSG

approached the University with a
request to offer discounts to stu-
dents. Currently, costs of mem-
bership cards to use the bikes
range from $6 for 24 hours to $65
for one year.
The first 60 minutes of every
ride are free and each additional
30-minute period accrues a $3 fee.
The bikes, which are provided by
B-Cycle, have pre-installed GPS
trackers to both monitor riders'
trip and prevent the bikes from
being stolen.
Seyfarth said theft hasn't
been a problem in other cities
with bikeshare programs, and
she hopes ArborBike contin-
ues to spread throughout the
city.
"We hope to increase ridership
and expand the system," Seyfarth
said.

Partial agreement
signals step forward
in governing the
Gaza Strip
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip
(AP) -'The militant Palestinian
Hamas group and its rival Fatah,
movement on Thursday reached
a partial agreement on govern-
ing the Gaza Strip, signaling a
major step forward in reducing
their deep-seated enmity.
Meanwhile, a senior Palestin-
ian official said President Mah-
moud Abbas' government, which
runs the West Bank, will press
forward with a United Nations
bid to set a deadline for Israel
to end its occupation of lands
captured in the 1967 war, after
efforts to enlist American sup-
port for the effort ran aground.
"Work with the Americans
about the possibility of joint
action in the Security Council
has reached an impasse," said
chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat, adding that he expects
the Palestinian delegation in
New York to proposea U.N. reso-
lution on the issue within three
weeks.
The purpose of the resolution
is to set the groundwork for the
formal establishment of a Pales-
tinian state.
Meanwhile, after days of dis-
cussions with Fatah leaders in

Cairo, Hamas' deputy leader
Mussa -Abu Marzouk seemed
upbeat in describing the new
Gaza deal.
"We and Fatah have reached
a deal today on reconciliation,"
he said. "The deal states that a
(unity) government can officially
assume control over government
institutions in Gaza."
The deal struckbehind closed
doors in the Egyptian capital is
the sixth official accord between
the two groups, but with major
issues not yet resolved - includ-
ing salaries for Hamas employ-
ees in Gaza and control over the
coastal territory's security forc-
es - concerns over possible new
confrontations between the fac-
tions remain.
Outlining the deal's provi-
sions, Abu Marzouk said the new
unity government will start mak-
ing some payments to govern-
ment officials in Gaza, though
the question of full salaries has
been left to future negotiation.
Also, he said, the government
will jointly man border crossing
points with Israel and Egypt and
jointly administer a hoped-for
Gaza reconstruction process,
funded by donations from Euro-
pean and other western coun-
tries.
"We have set the reconstruc-
tion as high priority," Abu Mar-
zouk said.
Hamas and Fatah have a long
history of dashed hopes. They
agreed in April to form a unity

government in Gaza, now ruled
by Hamas, but the government
never really took hold amid long-
standing tensions between the
factions.
The tensions appear to have
spiked in recent weeks over Fatah
claims that Hamas's conduct of
the recent Hamas-Israel war led
to unacceptably high losses of life
and damage to property.
The 50 day conflict in July and
August in the Gaza Strip killed
more than 2,100 Palestinians
and left more than 18,000 homes
destroyed or severely damaged.
In the spring, Abbas worked out
atentative agreementwith Hamas
under which he would head a
temporary unity government of
experts in both the West Bank
and Gaza until elections could be
held. However, major issues were
left unresolved, including the fate
of 40,000 government employees
hired during the Hamas era and
control over the Gaza security
forces.
Hamas was mired in a severe
financial crisis when it struck
the deal, but has become embold-
ened since the end of the war
because fighting with Israel
boosted its popularity among
Palestinians.
The need to present a joint
front ahead of planned donor
talks for Gaza's reconstruction
may be pushing the rival factions
together now, even if sustain-
able reconciliation remains to be
achieved.

Ev aluating our policies
The process of investigating sexual assaults lacks transparency
The University's policies for investigating sexual assault
and caring for survivors constitute an important
piece of the fight against sexual violence on college
campuses. While the University should be commended for the
resources it currently offers survivors, those resources aren't
extensive enough. Furthermore, the University's investigative
processes are far too opaque to effectively deal with this grave
issue. The University should expand the resources, such as
the SANE program, implement new emergency responses and
clarify existing investigation methods.

Let's talk about gaydar

et's talk about the term
"gaydar" and how everyone
should quit using it.
Hopefully I'm_
not the only
person who
takes issue with
thisterm.Whose
bright idea was it
to conceptualize
gays and
lesbians as MICHAEL
identifiable blips SCHRAMM
on an imaginary
radar? I can only
wonder if my entrance into a room
sets off a frenzy of mental alarms.
For those of you who haven't
heard the term, "gaydar" refers
to one's ability to discern others
as gay or lesbian. People provide
a multitude of reasons for having
developed a good gaydar. Some
cite spending years in cities with
large gay populations. Others will
talk about how their intimate gay
friends have made them attuned
to identifying other homosexuals.
Some will just say it's a natural skill
they've developed over time.
I'm calling BS on all of those
explanations, because none of those
assist in labeling someone as gay or
lesbian. Sexualityis rootedinattrac-
tion, so you could only definitively
label someone as same-sex attract-
ed if you saw them taking sexual
or romantic interest in a same-sex
partner. But noting sexual attrac-
tion is rarely why someone claims
to have a "good gaydar." If this were
the only factor, we'd all have perfect
senses. We'd see Joe kissing Jeff at
a party and immediately know they
both like boys. "Gaydar" as a term

would be unnecessary.
This really only leaves one expla-
nation for why someone could iden-
tify another as same-sex attracted:
identifying them based on cultural
constructions of how homosexu-
als act (read: effeminate men and
butch lesbians).
Think about, how problematic
and socially backward that is. For
one, we're stripping homosexuals
who fulfill stereotypes of their
individuality. A gay man with pink
hair now lives in a world where
people believe his hair assists
in mirroring his sexuality. This
devalues his decision to be himself
and instead lumps his potentially
very personal choices into cliches.
Secondly, if we continue to accept
"gaydar" and general stereotyping
as correct, we're sending a message
that gay men are and should be fem-
inine. Similarly, we're implying that
lesbians are and should be mascu-
line. That's a problem. Though gay
men (like any men) can and should
be feminine if they want, effemina-
cy doesn't constitute gayness. Mas-
culine gsys and feminine lesbians
do exist, so we're essentially telling
these people they're not as homo-
sexual as their stereotypical coun-
terparts. Not only does this subtly
disconnect these members. from
their sexuality, it also typecasts
gays and lesbians. Can we please
just make sexuality about attraction
and not about stereotypes?
Third, it's just politically
backward. If you couldn't see
someone, you'd be wrong to assume
their race throughonlyhearingthem
talk about their favorite food (sushi,
fried chicken or tacos). If that's

crossing aline, why wouldn't we feel
the same disdain towards assigning
a sexuality based on masculinity
or femininity?
Fourth, "gaydar" contributes to
the gender binary between men
and women. If a man can only be
feminine if he's classified under a
specific subspecies of man, we're
not really teaching men that they
can have feminine characteristics.
The same goes for masculinity in
women. If you're a feminist seeking
social equality, you should be
fighting against "gaydar."
Fifth, we'ie stripping gays and
lesbians of their ability to address
their sexuality on their own terms.
Coming out can be a really personal
and sensitive topic. By already
deciding someone's sexuality,
you're taking something potentially
very personal from them.
If I haven't already made my
point clear, it's really imperative
that "gaydar" and its general use
are stopped. If you're gay and are
using your instincts for the purpose
of pursuing someone romantically,
I guess it's acceptable.aHowever,
in any other use, especially among
people identified as heterosexual,
it's not acceptable.
I know itcan be hard to avoid
assuming someone's sexuality.
We've been conditioned by our
environment to have the thought
cross our minds, but that's not an
excuse to allow it to continue. Fight
the urge to classify someone, and
instead let them reveal themselves
to you. It's the right thing to do.

Taking into account the prevalence of
sexual assaults on college campuses, the
University should strive to make the health
and safety of survivors a top priority. The
University offers resources such as Sexual
Assault Prevention and Awareness Center
and Counseling and Psychological Services
to help survivors cope with sexual assault,
but there are currently few emergency
resources offered that address immediate
care. Current University and SAPAC pro-
tocol recommend that survivors of sexual
assault should go to the University Hospital
to undergo a medical exam within 96 hours
of the incident in order to preserve vital evi-
dence of sexual assault. While SAPAC offers
24-hour support and a crisis hotline through
which survivors can request an advocate to
accompany them to the emergency room,
this is the closest the University comes to an
emergency medical response. The Universi-
ty should have an emergency response team
within ,pJDiviion of Public Safety and
Security to aid survivors, especially when
the timely collection of evidence and rapid
medical treatment is vital.
After an assault, survivors often experience
trauma or feelings of intimidation, and many
may feel embarrassed to discuss the assault
with another individual. Having to travel to
the University Hospital - a remote location in
relation to the majority of the student popula-
tion - may discourage survivors from see'king
help. Although many medical practitioners are
certified to care for survivors of sexual assault,
a sexual assault nurse examiner receives spe-
cific certification and trainingto besthelp these
unique patients. Near campus, the only SANEs
available are at the University Hospital and at
St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor Hospital. Howev-
er, some universities offer a SANE program on
campus, such as Oregon State University's Stu-
dent Health Services. In order to provide more
comprehensive care to students, the University
of Michigan should consider creating a more
centralized clinic - or at least an intermediary
location for the time being - designed to spe-
cifically treat and help survivors.
Since February, the University has been
under investigation by the U.S. Department
of Education for a possible Title IX violation
in which a student claimed to be sexually
harassed and the school "failed to promptly
and equitably respond to complaints." This
investigation makes it clear that there are
questions about the efficacy of the Universi-
ty's protocol for investigating these situations
and little information has been made avail-
able to students about this investigation pro-
cess. The entirety of this process needs to be
made clearer, from where students should go
directly after an incident to the subsequent

steps the University takes in investigating.
The difficulty in proving that a sexual
assault has occurred is one potential barrier
to coming to a resolution in a potential inves-
tigation. Establishing whether or not con-
sent was given is also blurred in situations in
which alcohol is consumed by both parties.
Such inconsistencies make it difficult to come
to a decision when reconstructing the events.
The University's Student Sexual
Misconduct Policy, which is posted online,
states that the Title IX coordinator is solely
responsible for "the final decision on whether,
how and to what extent the University
will conduct an investigation." And if the
complainant requests confidentiality or that
there be no investigation, a panel consisting of
the Title IX coordinator and "staff members"
will decide possible courses of action. It is
unclear exactly who sits on this panel; the
policy states only that the interests of "the
University, law enforcement, survivors
of sexual misconduct, person ccused of
sexual misconduct and/or other offices as
deemed necessary and appropriate under
the circumstances" are to be represented on
the panel. The University should endeavor
to make public more information about the
steps of its investigative process to the extent
that it doesn't compromise the confidentiality
of the survivors of sexual assault. Only then
can the public hold both investigators and the
investigative process accountable.
Better educating the community on
investigative practices and thereby opening
these practices to scrutiny would give the
University a valuable opportunity to reassess
its strategies with regard to sexual assault. A
clear, specific and well-enforced investigative
protocol would only serve to help survivors
of sexual assault by more effectively holding
offenders accountable. Such a protocol also
has the potential to facilitate necessary
improvement of campus culture surrounding
sexual assault.
While the University can work to address
internal problems regarding sexual assault
investigation, the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion must work to consistently enforce Title
IX. The Department of Education's Office
for Civil Rights must impose real penalties
on universities for the mishandling of sexual
assault cases. Though the current conse-
quences for Title IX violations range from
rewriting policies to staffturnover, no college
or university has endured the highest penalty
of losing funding. The Department of Educa-
tion, and the federal government as a whole,
must work in conjunction with institutions of
higher education to provide a better environ-
ment for sexual assault survivors and overall
awareness of the issue of sexual assault.

n a warm autumn Ann
Arbor morning earlier this
semester I went to the Fish-
bowl to finish a
programming
assignment for
one of my classes.
I was wearing
a sundress and
makeup because
thewether way.
nice and, more
importantly, I JULIA
subscribe to the ZARINA
belief that look-
ing fly as hell and
writing computer code don't have to
be mutually exclusive activities.
As I sat down at a computer the
man beside me turned and said,
"Oh, these are all actually CAEN
computers in this area", referring
to the software used by the College
of Engineering that only engineer-
ing students can log on to. It was an
innocent enough statement at face
value but it represents something
that many students face every day:
I didn't look like what this person
thought an engineer should look
like, and as a result, he immediately
placed me into a category differ-
ent from himself. In engineering, as
well as in many other fields, there is
pervasive and subconscious mental-
ity that there exists a set definition
of what a "real engineer" is and if
someone doesn't fit it, they don't
inherently belong.
As a woman, I have my own expe-
riences with discrimination in engi-
neering, as do many of my fellow
students. "Iwish mysonwas as lucky
as you," one of my parent's friends
once mentioned offhandedly to me,
"it's unfair that girls take the spots
of guys like him just because schools
need to have a certain number of
female engineers."
It's an exhausting logical fal-
lacy, the underlying belief that these
positions could be taken away from
someone innately entitled to them in
the first place, and one that overlooks
many of the realities that women and
other historically underrepresented
demographics in engineering face.
The factthatthere are anumberof
successful engineers who arewomen
of color, who are gay, who are from
low socioeconomic backgrounds,
does not mean it's "easier" to be any
of those identities. In many cases,
being a woman in engineering means
that you still have to prove that you
deserve to be where you are at every
turn. To get straight A's to be con-
sidered just as smart and capable as
your male colleagues who have aver-
age GPAs. To have to be higher up in
a company than the man you gradu-
ated with in order to receive the same
paychecks as him. The lack of equal-
ity in engineering isn't just a wom-
an's problem or a Person of Color's
problem; as acommunity, we need to
examine our culture critically.
Although many engineers would

like to believe that a culture that
values technical skills would award
merit based on ability and perfor-
mance alone, the facts speak to a
much more biased truth, one that
can be quantified in part by look-
ing at the wage gap among different
demographics within engineering.
Women earna third less than their
male counterparts - a statistic that
doesn't begin taccount fr the
additional inequalities that People
of Color, both men and women, face
in the workplace. These statistics
provide just one indication that the
culture of engineering doesn't view
technical ability to be the only indi-
cation of value.
Googling the phrase "what makes
a good engineering culture?" returns
a number of results, all of which,
interestingly, have almost nothing
to do with engineers themselves.
From "push relentlessly towards
automation,". to "optimize for-itera-
tion speed," few of the suggestions
address any application of human
behavior. The nature of engineering
has changed though, as engineers
we work in a society where the social
element of our work has the poten-
tial to have as much impact as the
purely mechanical aspects in today's
global, knowledge-based economy.
Although these occupational expec-
tations have evolved, many leaders in
the STEM fields still shy away from
addressing the social injustices that
are pervasive in our community.
Luke Bruski is one of the students
in the College of Engineering who is
working to change the conventions
that lead to these types of dispari-
ties. As Executive Director of Own
It, a student organization focused
on social justice topics as they relate
to engineers, Luke explains that his
group's mission is "a challenge to
the Michigan community to be our
most authentic selves." Formed in
2013 by Nick Clift, a masters stu-
dent in the Engineering Global
Leadership honors program, Own
It has hosted a number of on-cam-
pus events, seminars, and speak-
ers focused on leading inclusion
and advocating for diversity in the
College of Engineering.
Luke emphasizes that own It
exists not to advocate for a narrow or
specific interpretation of inclusion,
but to provide a space for people of
all identities to speak forthemselves.
Their major goal is to host.a keynote
event once a semester and have it
represent a theme that they do sup-
porting events around. The group's
first keynote featured the Vice
President of Rockwell Automation,
Ed Seaburg, and one of the direc-
tors for Amazon Baby, Stephanie
Landry, who discussed their experi-
ences surrounding LGBTQ issues in
the workplace with a packed Chese-
brough Auditorium. This semester,
Own It's semester theme and key-
note event will address the topic of
gender dynamics, focusing on the

experiences of women and transgen-
der engineers.
The students of Own It are not
armchair philosophers or passive
activists, either. Perhaps the most
powerful element of these events are
the speakers and the leaders them-
selves: engineers from both within
and beyond the university who have
personally experienced the issues
they are advocating joA& are
actively invested in the belief that
engineering can be a culture that
encompasses a variety of identities
- gay, female, black, transgender and
many others - and distinguishes
them as unique and valuable contri-
butions to our profession.
For many in STEM fields, there's
an attitude that these topics are
not contenders for the'most criti-
cal issues we face in our profession,
and that addressing subjects in the
humanities is somehow a less noble
pursuit than circuit design or dif-
ferential equations. But engineering
doesn't exist in a vacuum and having
aviewpoint that fails to consider our-
selves and the people we are design-
ing for as part of the same system is
especially nearsighted. Social justice
isn't outside the scope of a valuable
engineering culture, it's an increas-
ingly integral part of-it. There iswell-
established research that shows that
diverse teams produce better results
in academia and in the workplace,
and an economic motivator for social
change such as that is often the most
powerful catalyst for the people
already in power to stop viewing
the success of others as a zero-sum
game that comes at the expense of
their own.
What I challenge our community
to do, and what groups like Own It
work to promote, is for all of us to
look well beyond that reason. That
begins with giving these topics the
space they deserve and demand in
our community and by listening to
and learning from the people who
experience them on a daily basis.
One valuable aspect of our engineer-
ing culture is that it holds in high
regard the ideal that we should be
always continue learning and strive
for improvement, for the best pos-
sible system or solution. We are not
exempt from that process. Until we
embrace these topics and address
these issues that affect so many in
our community, our profession is
inherently lacking. There is cur-
rently one dominant narrative in
engineering that is vastly unreflec-
tive of us as a whole. We're not all
white, straight, cisgender males. We
shouldn't all be expected to act like
we are, and we don't all want to be.
Our identities are not just something
to be accommodated, but something
to be embraced and seen as inherent-
ly integral and valuable to engineer-
ing asa profession.

After three weeks in isolation,
an American doctor who con-

him to recover and remains con-

Magnitude 6.2
quake causes
only minor
damage
ANCHORAGE, Alaska
(AP) - A powerful earth-
quake shook a large swath
of Alaska on Thursday
morning, knocking things
off shelves and causing peo-
ple to take cover but bring-
ing no immediate reports of
injuries or major damage.
The quake had a prelimi-
nary magnitude of 6.2, and
it hit at 9:51 a.m. The epi-
center was about 80 miles
northwest of the state's
largest city, where it was
strongly felt, the Alaska
Earthquake Center said.
The quake lingered for
at least a minute in some
areas.
The earthquake center
is in Fairbanks, 250 miles
northeast of the epicenter,
but it was felt, even there,
said Sara Meyer, a center
research technician.
"It was about 15 seconds
of long-period shaking, sort
of like you're on a boat,"
Meyer said.
Staffers at the Nesbett
Courthouse in downtown
Anchorage felt the shaking
in their office on the top
floor of the six-story build-
ing.
"My computer tower
fell off my desk," judicial

assistant Ellen Bozzini
said. Everyone stood in
doorways until an evacu-
ation was ordered. Then
they took the stairs out-
side, where they waited for
about 20 minutes before
being allowed back in the
building.
There were no immedi-
ate reports of major damage
or injury, and no tsunami
was expected, according
to an emergency manage-
ment official. The fact that
the earthquake's center
was, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey, about
63 miles underground soft-
ened its impact on the state,
experts said.
Bryan Fisher, incident
commander for the state
emergency operations
center, said the office has
received scattered reports
of things flying off shelves.
But there have been no
reports of any infrastruc-
ture damage.
The Alaska Railroad
stopped all trains to check
the tracks and bridges for
damages, which is a pro-
cedure after earthquakes,
Fischer said.
In the Matanuska-
Susitna Borough north
of Anchorage, closer to
the epicenter, there were
reports of books knocked
off shelves but no serious
damage, borough spokes-
woman Patty Sullivan said.
"We all felt it," she said,
adding she was sitting in

her parked minivan when
the quake happened. She
believed someone was play-
ing a joke on her and pur-
posely shaking her van. "I
got out, expecting to find a
laughing face," she said.
In Willow, about 40
miles north of Anchorage,
a clerk at the town's hard-
ware and grocery store said
everything shook but noth-
ingfell off the shelves.
"Everything just rocked
around," Anne Holliday
said. "It's an old building,
just rickety."
Debra Pearce, who
works for Alaska Auction
Company, said she has
lived in Alaska for years
and this was the strongest
quake she felt since a 1964
temblor. That earthquake
- a magnitude 9.2 - was
the second-highest magni-
tude ever recorded, and the
quake and resulting tsuna-
mis killed 131 people.
"This was akin to that,
the way it hit real hard and
rolled and rolled and rolled
and rolled, and you didn't
know if it was just going to
pick up or not," Pearce said.
Sandy Lee, who owns
Sandy Espre Cafe in mid-
town Anchorage, said she
didn't feel the earthquake
as she was driving to work.
When she got to her busi-
ness, she didn't know what
had happened. Coffee
syrup bottles littered the
floor, and dolls had fallen
off of shelves.

An "angry employee" at a

two women, killing one of them,
Thursday before an off-duty law

MoorePolice Sgt. JeremyLewis
told reporters at the scene that
the suspect attacked the first two
people he encountered at Vaughan

The motive for the attack was

Amid drought, rain
treats Northern
California wildfire
A day of light rain brought big
gains against a Northern Cali-
fornia wildfire Thursday, dra-
matically reducing the number
of homes that are threatened by
the flames from several thou-
sand to just hundreds.
In addition, calls for evacu-
ation in two communities were
reduced from mandatory to vol-
untary, leaving just one neigh-
borhood under strict evacuation
orders, the El Dorado County
Sheriff's Department said in a
statement. It wasn't immedi-
ately clear. how many people
remained away from their
homes.
The rains had brought fears
of flooding and dangerous con-
ditions in the King Fire's huge
burn area east of Sacramento,
but they remained light and
helpful to the firefight. A flash
flood warning in effect for sev-
eral hours was called off in early
evening.
LIMASSOL, Cyprus
Syrian refugees
refuse to leave ship
More than 300 people,
apparent refugees fleeing
from Syria, refused to leave a
cruise ship that rescued them
from a small boat stranded off
Cyprus, a cruise line official
said Thursday.
Salamis Cruise Lines Man-
aging Director Kikis Vasiliou
said that the people are insist-
ing that they be taken to Italy
instead.
"They want us to send them
to Italy," Vasiliou told report-
ers at the east Mediterranean
island's main Limassol port.
"The authorities, they have to
decide what they want to do."
Vasiliou blamed Cypriot
authorities for keeping him in
the dark about how they intend

to resolve the situation.

BEIRUT (AP) - When
the United States opened
its aerial campaign against
the Islamic State group in
Syria this week, its first
salvo also hit an al-Qaida
cell it says was planning
terror attacks - a move
that has injected more
chaos into the conflict
and could help President
Bashar Assad.
Amid fears they could
be targeted next, two
rebel factions already have
evacuated their bases, and
residents in areas under
the control of other Islamic
brigades cower at home,
wondering whether their

districts willbe hit.
While al-Qaida's branch
in Syria, known as the
Nusra Front, is considered
a terrorist group by the
United States, among the
Syrian opposition it has
a degree of support and
respect because its fighters
are on the front lines along-
side other rebels battling
Assad's forces.
To them, the U.S.
strikes, which hit several
Nusra Front facilities and
killed dozens of its fight-
ers, appeared to signal an
American move to take
out any rebel faction that
adheres to an Islamic ide-
ology - a large segment of
the rebellion against Assad.
U.S. officials say the
strikes were aimed at a cell
of hardened jihadis within
the Nusra Front called the
Khorasan Group, which
Washington says poses a

direct and imminent threat
to U.S. and Western inter-
ests.
On Thursday, FBI direc-
tor James Comey acknowl-
edged that the U.S. did not
have precise intelligence
on where or when the
group might attack, adding
that there was no indica-
tion the airstrikes had dis-
rupted the cell's plots.
"It's hard to say wheth-
er that's tomorrow, three
weeks from now or three
months from now. But
it's the kind of threat you
have to operate under the
assumption that it is tomor-
row," Comey told reporters
in Washington.
U.S. intelligence offi-
cials say the group has
been trying to perfect a
non-metallic bomb that
can get past airport secu-
rity and beused to blow up

'Books are far losers.'
You don't need the
books to love GoT '

ByDREWMARON
DailyArts Writer
When I tell people I'm a
huge "Game of Thrones,"
fan, they usually ask the
same question: "So you read
the books, then?" Instead of
sheepishly denying that I've
yet to read the mammoth
sized opus that is George R.
R. Martin's "A Song of Ice
and Fire," I proudly admit the
truth: "No, I haven't read the
books and won't do so until
the series is over."
I love television. I also love
reading and literature. Over
the summer, I read upwards of
30 books and graphic novels.
And not one of them "A Song of
Ice And Fire." Sure, every time
I travelled to a bookstore, I'd
find my hand floating over an
unsold paperback of "Game of
Thrones." 'Go ahead," I'd tell
myself, "just do it, already!"
So now I finally want to be
out with the damn thing: I've
had every opportunity to read
the books of "A Song of Ice
and Fire" and, until the show
is over, shall refuse to open a
single page.
Why?
There are a number of usual
reasons' I list off. There's the
"Godfather" excuse: "you love
The Godfather film, right?
So why not*read the original
book by Mario Puzo." The
book "The Godfather" is
frequently cited as one of the
best crime novels of the 20th
century and the movie would
not exist without it ... but
Santino Corleone's horse-like
appendage is also a recurring
motif.
I love reading. It's why I'm

which, however, you'll have to
decide for yourself). Andre's
father, Pops, (Laurence
Fishburne, "Hannibal") would
posit that his son has lost touch

son to play field hockey over

Black one. On the other hand,
Fishburne's foil is Andre's
wife, Rainbow (Tracee Ellis

But that's not to say "Black-

series is undone by pacing

In the end, despite what
society might dictate and
despite what the voices in
his head - mainly Pops' and
Rainbow's - might tell him,
Andre is just a father trying
to make the best decisions
for his family. And in that
regard, "Black-ish" is a series
for everyone; the rare "broad"
comedy that doesn't substitute
the wit of its narrative in favor
of drawing in the masses.
Because the best comedies can
be bothsmart and far-reaching,
and "Black-ish" is just that -
never dull nor dumb, universal
in its appeal and ultimately,
the perfect companion for
"Modern Family."

it interesting that your single-

no reason to move on to this
from "Halo;" the multiplayer
in "Destiny" is Bungie's least
complete yet.
"Destiny" is not a bad game,
but it could be so much more
than it is right now. Perhaps
somewhere down the line of
Bungie's purported 10-year
support plan, it will be great. But
until then, your money is better
spent elsewhere.

By MATTHEW KIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
When Kevin Sullivan ran on
the track in the 1990s, he was
almost always being followed by
other runners.
The most decorated runner
in Michigan history constantly
led the pack, winning 16 Big
Ten championships, 14 NCAA
championships and eight Big
Ten Athlete of the Year Awards
over his four years in cross
country and track and field.
This year, Sullivan returns
to the program in which he
found the bulk of his success in
another leadership role - as the
head coach of the men's cross
country team.
Coaching isn't new for
Sullivan, as he served as
a volunteer assistant for
Michigan, Illinois and Florida
State. But he has always wanted
to return to Michigan in the top
position, and on July 14, he got
the opportunity.
"From the time I graduated
as an athlete, basically the first
thing I did was continue here as
a volunteer coach with (former
Michigan cross country coach
Ron Warhurst)," Sullivan said.
"The goal and the idea all along
was that this was a job I wanted
to eventually graduate into."
His path back to Michigan
hasn't been as clearly laid out
as the courses he used to run.
In 2008, the job was open, but
Sullivan didn't feel the timing
was right because he had
the chance to start his own
business. Instead, he opened
Capital City Runners, a full-
service specialty running store
in Tallahassee, Florida.
He worked as an analyst
for Big Ten Network and as an
editorial research assistant for
Ontario Sports TV during the
2012 Olympics. However, there
was always something pulling
him back to Michigan.
This summer, when the
position opened up again,
Sullivan decided to seize the
moment, because he didn't know
when it might become available

a third time.
"I had such great experiences
here as an athlete that I
wanted to be able to come back
and be a part of seeing a lot
of other athletes have those
same experiences," he said.
"From winning individual
Big Ten championships,
to team championships, to
All-Americans, to national
champions, I want to be able to
help guide our athletes to reach
those same milestones."
As an athlete, Sullivan was
able to focus on improving
himself, but now he has new
pressure and responsibility.
He has to think about the team
and the 28 runners who must
simultaneously perform their
best in order to succeed.
One of Sullivan's favorite
memories as a Michigan athlete
was his distance medley relay
NCAA title. It wasn't just about
himself, but the group work that
he relished, making coaching a
natural position for Sullivan.
Now, as a coach, in order to
have the entire team firing at
the same time, Sullivan has
focused on making sure each
runner is versatile, mimicking
his skill set while at Michigan.
Sullivan has stressed that
adaptability to his runners.
"It is important that as a
coaching staff and as a track and
field team that we remember we
are not just about running well
in cross country," he said. "We
are not just about trying to run
well on the track. We have got
to do both those as efficiently as
possible."
While the team already has a
very strong distance team on the
cross country side with a number
of athletes who can run the 5K,
10K and 3K steeple chase at a
high level, Sullivan is working
on reviving some of the middle-
distance traditions at Michigan.
Under former coach Alex
Gibby, training had more
of a mileage-oriented goal,
meaning the team put in extra
miles to build strength in the
longer races. Now, there's an
additional emphasis on mid-

race tactics along with the
long-distance training, making
practices more balanced.
"In terms of the program in
general, the obvious change was
the head coach," said fifth-year
senior James Yuan. "We're the
same people on the same team,
and working toward the same
goal: to be Big Ten champs and
to improve our national ranking.
With Coach (Sullivan) coming
in, that was just a re-emphasis
on the positive direction we
want to take with the program.
Everyone was already on board,
so that made that particular
change particularly easy."
The Michigan program
was on the rise during Gibby's
last three years in Ann Arbor,
finishing eighth in the Big Ten in
2010, to tied for third in 2011, to
second the last two years.
While a fall in the standings
could be feasible with a team
consisting of 15 rookie runners,
Sullivan believes there is cause
for optimism.
"I think that even though
maybe some guys were
apprehensive about the coaching
change, they realized I am not
coming in not knowing how to
perform at a high level," Sullivan
said. "I bringa lot of experience
just from my own competitive
background and some of the
coaches I worked under, so
I think that has built some
confidence in the team and some
trust that maybe would have
taken a little longer if it had been
someone else that had come in
here and taken over."
Michigan is looking to take
the step from second to first in
the Big Ten. It will be a tough
jump, with Indiana returning
most of its scorers from its
championship team last year
and Wisconsin returning some
of its leaders fromitsthird-place
team, but Sullivan is working on
instilling the mentality of being
champions.
Though Sullivan is no longer
running the courses, he'll be
running through his athletes'
minds, moldingthem to replicate
the success he once had.

es to rebound from a loss to Rutgers.
With Ryan favoring a counter-
attacking 5-3-2 formation,
which utilizes the pace of the
team's wingers and wing-backs,
Michigan will almost certainly
have quite a few chances on goal.
"These formations have been
working well for us so far," Ryan
said. "Even though we aren't
yet sure exactly how we'll play,
you can expect something along
those lines."
At the end of the day, all
statistics and prior matches go
out the window when a rivalry is
involved.
With both teams having
something to prove in the Big
Ten as well as in the rivalry,
Saturday night's game is bound
to be a thriller.

"We were just really fatigued
by the time we played Rutgers,"
Ryan said. "We've only had two-

The state of the Big Ten
conference lives trapped in the
shadows.
Few non-conference wins
come easily, whether playing
against teams from the Mid-
American Conference or the
Southeastern Conference, and
they're constantly reminded of it.
The Big Ten has become the
butt of jokes on Twitter, and TV
pundits are quick to criticize it for
failing to stay competitive.
The Big Ten Conference is
like New York Yankees shortstop
Derek Jeter: It was once great, but
now, it's mediocre with flashes
of talent and struggles to play
defense.
But just when you're ready to
saythey're the worst of the Power
5 conferences, they redeem
themselves. They're an enigma of
a league.
The current state of the Big
Ten is up in the air, entering a
conference slate where it hopes
- to remain relevant in the College
Football Playoff era. Four teams
now have a feasible chance to play
for a national championship. Only
one Big Ten team - Michigan
State - is in the top 15.

coach Bo Pelini in the Big Ten's
teleconference Tuesday. "I think
there's a lot of parity, and there
are a lot of good football teams
out there. It's hard to bring it

FBS teams
with winning
records.
The losses stand out much
more than the wins. Michigan's
31-0 defeat to Notre Dame, or
Wisconsin's late collapse to LSU
in the first week of the season
punctuate the conference's
performance. Even its best teams
- the Spartans and Ohio State
- couldn't save the conference's
reputation when they lost to
Oregon and Virginia Tech,
respectively, in Week 2.
And the Big Ten's 2-5 record

in bowl games last season doesn't
help.
"If you base it on non-
conference games, then yeah,
criticism is warranted," says
Sporting News college football
columnist Matt Hayes in an
interview with the Daily.
"They've struggled a lot in these
games and that's really kind of
compounded.
"I think the overriding thing,
though, is talent. That's the issue
- the teams (in the Big Ten) that
are recruiting successfully are the
two teams that had guys coaching
in the SEC, because they know
the commitment it takes."
Big Ten teams that recruit

compete better than the Big Ten.
"We've got a lot of good
football teams in our conference,"
said Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz
in the teleconference. "I think
the teams have represented the
conference very well, and I'm
sure they'll continue to. I'm
happy certainly when anybody in
the league wins."
It's tough for the Big Ten to
boastthatithastheoldestprogram

has long been a laughingstock.
Having the winningest program
doesn't mean as much when the
Wolverines have won just two out
of four games this year.
There's a narrative about

with other teams," said Penn
State coach James Franklin
on Tuesday. "But I don't really
study it or spend a whole lot of
time thinking about it or being
concerned about it."
So when Michigan coach
Brady Hoke says his team's goal
of winning the Big Ten is still
possible, he could be right.
The state of the Big Ten right

Michigan's road to the BIG title game

It wasn't even brown:
The jug's big history

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Everyone has heard the
criticism the Big Ten conference
has received over the first month
of the college football season.
No. 22 Ohio State lost starting
quarterback Braxton Miller in the
preseason. No. 9 Michigan State
and No.19 Wisconsin had difficult
Pac-12 and SEC matchups,
respectively, in week two.
Despite Michigan's early
struggles, the East division is still
up for the taking - and Michigan
coach Brady Hoke won't let you
forget it.
But the Wolverines (2-2)
toughest games will come on the
road against the Buckeyes and
Spartans. Under Hoke's tenure,
Michigan has
yet to beat either
team away The
from Michigan 1
Stadium. division
For now, it's
still a possibility. the to
Here's a look at
Michigan's path -
to the Big Ten
Championship, and how it stands
up against the competition:
vs. Minnesota (3-1): The
Golden Gophers rely on a power-
running game that averages 5.1
yards per carry to move their
offense. Last week against San
Jose State, Minnesota backup
quarterback Chris Streveler only
completed one pass for a Golden
Gophers' passing attack that
ranks last in the conference, but
ran for 161 yards and a score in
his first career start. Minnesota
coach Jerry Kill was "cautiously
optimistic" Wednesday that
starter Mitch Leidner will be back
against the Wolverines. But the
Golden Gophers look to running
back David Cobb to keep them in
games. The senior has run for 539
yards and four touchdowns on 92
carries through four games.-
On the other side of the ball,
Michigan's offense should find
some successagainst Minnesota's
defense, which allows 383.3 yards
per game. But that same unit has
forced 13 turnovers, which could
be problematic for a Wolverine
offense that has already allowed
over 12.
at Rutgers (0-1 Big Ten, 3-1
overall): Michigan's first road

night game this season didn't go
so well, but maybe it will find
more success in New Jersey.
Rutgers' Athletic Department is
planning a "black-out" against
the Wolverines and expects the
prime-time matchup to draw
the biggest crowd of the season.
But the Scarlet Knights have
struggled with injuries, the worst
one coming last week in their win
over Navy, when starting running
back Paul James tore his anterior
cruciate ligament.
Senior quarterback Gary Nova
has had an up-and-down season
thus far, with the low point
coming in a five interception,
13-10 loss to the Nittany Lions.
His favorite target is junior
Leonte Carroo, the Big Ten's
fourth-leading receiver.
On defense,

is up for best defensive
end duo in
aking David Milewski
and Kemoko
Turay. The two
have combined
for a conference-best seven sacks,
and Michigan's work-in-progress
offensive line will have its hands
full containing them. To the
average fan, this game should be
a cakewalk for the Wolverines,
but playing Rutgers, at night and
on the road is the quintessential
trap game. Look out for this one.
vs. Penn State (1-0, 4-0): The
Nittany Lions have stormed back
into the Big Ten championship
conversation after the NCAA
lifted sanctions. From 2011 And
it came at a perfect time, as Penn
State is the only undefeated team
in the East division. Quarterback
Christian Hackenberg and first-
year coach James Franklin have
turned the Nittany Lions into a
formidable foe.
While Hackenberg makes
Penn State's passing attack
eighth in the nation, its run game
was ineffective until last week
against UMass. But even after
exploding for 228 yards against
the Minutemen, the Nittany
Lions average a meek 3.3 yards
per carry. Michigan's dominant
front seven could stifle an already
struggling ground game.,
On defense, Penn State has
been dominant, leading the nation
in rush defense and allowing just

49.5 yards per game. The Nittany
Lions also rank sixth in scoring
defense, holding teams to just 11
points pergame.While Michigan's
home night game should draw a
crowd of over 110,000, it's also the,
Wolverines' most difficult home
matchup. It will have been five
years, 11 months and 24 days since
it last triumphed over Penn State.
at Michigan State (2-1):
With Ohio State a shell of itself
without Miller, the Spartans are
Michigan's biggest road test this
season. Connor Cook resumes
his place behind center, but like
last season, it's Michigan State's
defense that tells the tale. The
Spartans held Eastern Michigan
to one yard of total offense in the
first half of their Sep.20 matchup.
While Michigan State's loss to
No. 2 Oregon in week two skewed
its defensive numbers, nobody is
underestimating this unit.
Offensively, the Spartans rank
first in the conference in scoring,
largely thanks to its 73-point
performance against the Eagles.
They've beaten opponents by an
average of 48.5 points in their two
wins. Cook leads a Michigan State
offense that relies on the passing
attack over the ground game, so
the Wolverine secondary will
need to play a big role if it wants
to pull the upset.
vs.Indiana (2-1): The Hoosiers
rank second in the Big Ten in
total offense, and last season,
they showed the Wolverines just
how explosive their offense can
be in a 63-47 shootout. Much of
Indiana's offense comes on the
ground, averaging 310.1 yards
per game, but that plays into
Michigan's defensive strengths.
Defensively, the Hoosiers
struggle inthesecondary,ranking
second-to-last in the conference
in pass defense. Through four
weeks, Indiana has the Big Ten's
most impressive win, a 31-27
performance on the road over
then-ranked No. 18 Missouri last
Saturday.
at Northwestern (1-2): After
an impressive start in 2013,
the Wildcats are on a slide that
stretches back to last year. This
season has been a struggle for
Northwestern, which lost its
first two games of the season
before getting a win against
Western Illinois. But the easy

part of the Wildcats' schedule
is over, and now they face Penn
State, Wisconsin and Nebraska in
three of their first four weeks of
conference play.
Offensively, Northwestern is
last in the Big Ten in scoring, and
second to last in total offense.
The Wildcats have also struggied
on defense, allowing 397 yards
per game and eight touchdowns.
Last year, it took Michigan three
overtime periods to beat the
Wildcats, and if the Wolverines
are still struggling by this Nov. 8
matchup, it could be an ugly game
for the conference.
vs. Maryland (3-): In
Michigan's last home game of the
season, it can expect the Terps to
ride sixth-year quarterback C.J.
Brown and explosive receiver
Stefon Diggs. Brown has remedial
arm strength, but can beat
defenses with his legs. Diggs is
Maryland's biggest weapon and
averages 12.4 yards per catch.
Maryland's defense, which is
ranked worst in the conference,
is a different story. The unit
struggles on both rush and
pass defense allowing 199.2 and
287 yards, respectively. The

latter figure is the worst in the
conference.
at Ohio State (2-1): Michigan
fans know how close the
Wolverines came to pulling the
upset over a top-5 Buckeyes squad
last season. With J.T. Barrett
leading Ohio State instead of
Miller, Urban Meyer's team has
started off differently.
By the time the Wolverines
make it to Columbus, the
freshman will have a full season
of experience under center,
which could change things. That
being said, Ohio State has a rough
offensive line that has given up
eight sacks in three games (seven
in its loss to Virginia Tech).
Defensively, the Buckeyes'
biggest weakness is their run
defense, which ranks 13th in
the conference, allowing 180.7
yards per game. Their pass
defense, though, is the best in
the Big Ten and has recorded five
interceptions.
Michigan-Ohio State matchups
are always entertaining, but with
Hoke fighting for a job, this could
be the Wolverines' last chance
to give it everything they've
got before change envelops the
program.

This is the trophy game that
started them all.
And, unlike the Heroes Trophy
(Iowa vs. Nebraska, if anyone's
curious), this one wasn't crafted
by a graphic design company, nor
was its beginning marked with a
press release.
No, this one began organically
in 1903, and it has endured ever
since.
That October, legendary
Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost's
squad ventured west for what'
was billed as the biggest game
in years against Minnesota. The
Wolverines had never lost under
Yost, and, at that point in the
1903 season, were undefeated and
hadn't conceded a point.
Concerned that the Gophers
might taint the water supply to
gain a competitive advantage,
Yost instructed student manager
Tommy Roberts to travel into
Minneapolis and purchase a jug
for the game.
Roberts spent 30 cents on the
container, which at five gallons
wasn't exactly little and hadn't yet
been painted brown.
That afternoon, Greatc r
Northrop Field was packed
to capacity in exnctation of
the clash. Fans wha couldn't
purchase tickets even took to
climbing trees and telephone
poles to watch the game.
Clean water or not, Yost's
Wolverines were statistically
dominated by Minnesota. But
the Golden Gophers still trailed
throughout much of the game,
and ultimately scored a game-
tying touchdown with about two
minutes remaining.
Then all hell broke loose. The
fans stormed the field, the referees
deemed it impossible to resume
play before sundown, and the
game ended early in a 6-6 tie.
"Minnesota supreme in
Western football," blared the
headline in the next day's Sunday
Tribune. "Yost and Michigan
practically beaten."
In their haste to leave Greater
Northrop Field, Yost's squad had
left the water jug in the visitors'
locker room. The morning after
the game, custodian Oscar
Munson found it and brought it to
Minnesota Athletic Director Dr.
Louis J. Cooke, who had it hung it

in his office.
But before then, Cooke and
Munson inscribed it: "Michigan
jug. Captured by Oscar, October
31, 1903." Then, they wrote the
final score: "Minnesota 6," in large
letters, and in much smaller type,
"Michigan 6."
The teams didn't meet again
until 1909, but the incident wasn't
forgotten. Ina pep rally before the
game, Minnesota's captain told
Michigan's players that they could
earn their jugback with a win.
The Wolverines agreed, and
they won, 15-6, finally returning
their container to Ann Arbor.
Upon reclaiming it from the
Golden Gophers in 1920, Michigan
painted the schools' block 'M's'
onto the trophy and created
columns so that each years' result
could be recorded. Including a
victory in 1920, Michigan won 12
of the next 14 matchups.
The rest of the rivalry has
proceeded in much the same
fashion. The Wolverines lead the
series, 73-24, with three ties.
So if Michigan wins Saturday
and parades the jug to the student
section, or if the Gophers win
and snatch the trophy from the
Wolverine sideline, take note. It's
another chapter in a story 111 years
in the making.
