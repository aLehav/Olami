* Sweetwaters
coffee shop
to move into
old Borders

Franchise's fourth
A2 location will cater
more to students
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
University students who enjoy the
Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea locations
throughout Ann Arbor will soon
have an option much closer to
Central Campus.
Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea, an Ann
Arbor staple since 1993, is opening its
fourth Ann Arbor location in the space
formerly occupied by Borders at 604
East Liberty St. in Spring 2014. The
other Ann Arbor Sweetwaters shops
are located downtown, in Kerrytown
and on Plymouth Road.
University alum Lisa Bee, owner of
Sweetwaters said she was approached
by franchisees Sheila Qin Li and Roy Xu
to open a new store during the summer,
but the East Liberty location wasn't
decided upon until about two months
ago. Bee said she's happy with the new
location because Sweetwaters had
always wanted to be closer to campus.
, Bee is involved with the new

2,020-square-feet shop, which will
also have openings for 15 to 20 part-
time employees.
Despite the fact that there is a bevy
of coffee options all located within a
block of the space, Bee said she is not
worried about the competition, espe-
cially considering the coffee-drinking
habits of college students.
"I think we can all co-exist," Bee
said. "We're in downtown, and there
are many coffee shops around down-
town and we're all doing fine."
Music, Theatre & Dance sopho-
more Michael Saterson, a Starbucks
employee, said the addition of Sweet-
waters to the area will impact sales,
but he doesn't think it will sway Star-
bucks regulars.
Kirstin VanDeventer, a manager
at the Biggby Coffee on East Liberty,
said she doesn't expect Sweetwaters
to impact the sales of the company
because of the different environments
the two cafes offer.
"We have a very unique menu, and I
stand by that," VanDeventer said.
Bee will also be involved in the inte-
rior design plans, which she said may
be different from the environment of
other franchises.

Well, it was a good party.
The total cost of the
launch events for the Vic-

tors for Michigan develop-
ment campaign was between
$750,000 and 800,000,
according to a statement
Tuesday from Judith Mal-
colm, spokeswoman for the
Office of Development.
The estimate comprises a
media event on Thursday and
all events on Friday, includ-
ing the Community Festival

The official kick off for Vic-

campaign's main goals include
scholarships, providing funds

After stabbing at SAE,

Greek officials say
sober monitors get
sufficient training
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
Despite the stabbing of two
members of the University's chap-
ters of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
ternity early November by an angry
party-crasher, the Interfraternity
Council is conflicted as to whether
existing security measures are suf-
ficienttohandle future incidents.
The assault at SAE occurred
after four individuals were kicked
out of the fraternity house, lead-
ing to a heated verbal altercation in
which the suspect drew a knife and
stabbed two sober monitors.
Because SAE was expelled from
IFC in 2011 for hazing allegations,
the chapter's sober monitors were
not required to complete Univer-
sity Health Service's Sober Monitor
training, and the chapter was not
under jurisdiction of IFC's Social
Environment Management Policy.
SEMP provides a mandatory,
19-page protocol for hosting an IFC
social event. Strict SEMP guide-
lines are enforced by the Social

Responsibility Committee, which
is composed of 13 Greek-affiliated
students. On party nights, mem-
bers make rounds as "checkers" to
patrol for policy violations. During
that time, sober monitors mustsub-
mit to breathalyzer tests by request
of SEMP checkers, who also have
the right to shut down a party if
deemed necessary.
Whether SAE was followingthe
SEMP policy the night of the attack
is unclear. Brandon Weghorst, a
national spokesman for SAE, could
not be reached for comment after
repeated requests.
SEC,however, does not monitor
events that are unaffiliated with
IFC, like parties at SAE.
LSA junior Tommy Wydra, the
SRC chairman, said there are seri-
ous safety concerns for students at
unregulated off-campus fraterni-
ties, but praised the sober monitor
training required of IFC fraterni-
ties.
"I'm very confident that an inci-
dent like this would not occur at any
of our fraternity houses because of
the training that we go through,"
Wydra said.

First month of Obamacare

to attend alumni event in India website sees low enrollment

India conference will
seek to strengthen
University's ties
to nation
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily Staff Reporter
Sharing leadership techniques
with the world's largest democ-
racy, the Ross School of Business
will once again take its work over-

seas. University administrators,
faculty members and students
will collaborate with alumni and
business leaders in India Saturday
for the University of Michigan
India Conference.
The India Conference, primar-
ily organized by the University
of Michigan India Alumni Asso-
ciation, succeeds the Business
School's India Business Confer-
ence, which took place Nov. 1
in Ann Arbor. Over the last five
years, University affiliates have
held two conferences annually

- one in India and one in Ann
Arbor - that showcase the busi-
ness trends in both countries.
With speakers and attendees that
represent both demographics, the
conferences seek to highlight and
connect business leaders.
Business Prof. C.K. Prahalad,
who passed away in 2010, initi-
ated engagement between India
and the Business School in 1994
before India was recognized as a
potential emerging market. The
Business School has continued
his academic and research legacy
in the country through the India
Initiatives program.
India Initiatives, which
launched in August 2011, connects
the Business School with India
through opening research, aca-
demic, executive education and
outreach activities in both Ann
Arbor and India. The program
works to coordinate Ross-India
conferences in both locations
and conducts executive training
programs in Indian corporations,
such as the Tata and Mahindra.
"We're all ina connected world
now," said M.S. Krishnan, fac-
ulty director of India Initiatives.
"From a business standpoint,
whether it is a pure economic
opportunity or an opportunity
to (tackle) social issues, India is a
great place."
Unlike the conference that took
place in Ann Arbor, the Mumbai
conference won't be branded as an
exclusively business conference in
an attempt to expand the number
of disciplines addressed.
Of the University alumni who
have founded businesses in India,
most were not graduates of the
Business School, Bharat Govinda,
secretary of the UMIAA, said ina
July interview. The India Alumni
Association, through the confer-
ence and other networking initia-
tives, aims to connect alumni from
all of the University's schools and
colleges.
"If I was to think of the Uni-
versity of Michigan asa stock, the
University is trading extremely
below its face value," Govinda
said. "The association tries to
break boundaries."

Federal website
signed up 26,794
people in October
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Planting a paltry number on a
national disappointment, the
Obama administration revealed
Wednesdaythatjust 26,794 peo-
ple enrolled for health insur-
ance during the first, flawed
month of operations for the fed-
eral "Obamacare" website.
Adding in enrollment of more
than 79,000 in the 14 states
with their own websites, the
nationwide number of 106,000
October sign-ups was barely
one-fifth of what officials had
projected - and a small frac-
tion of the millions who have
received widely publicized pri-
vate coverage cancellations as a
result of the federal law.
The White House raced to
reassure anxious Democrats
who are worried about the con-
troversial program, which they
voted into existence three years
ago and which seems sure to
be a major issue in next year's
election campaigns. The admin-
istration, trying to regain the
initiative, for the first time indi-
cated a willingness to consider
legislation to stave off the wave
of cancellations that's com-
pounding the website technol-
ogy problems.
Some Democrats are seeking
changes in Obama's signature
program, and key Republicans,
many pressing for repeal, said
that even Wednesday's feeble
sign-up figures appeared to be
pumped up. The final number -
106,185 people - would be even
smaller if it counted only those
who finalized their enrollment by
actually paying their first month's
premium, Republicans said.
Administration officials and
senior congressional Demo-
crats expressed confidence
in the program's future. "We
expect enrollment will grow
substantially throughout the
next five months," said Health

and Human Services Secretary
Kathleen Sebelius, who is in
overall charge.
"Even with the issues we've
had, the marketplace is working
and people are enrolling," Sebe-
lius said. Responding to GOP
critics, she said the first premi-
ums are not due until Dec. 15.
The online, state-level insur-
ance markets were envisioned
as the new portal to coverage for
people who don't have health
plans on the job. But the fed-
eral market was overwhelmed
by technical problems when it
opened Oct. 1, and the experi-
ence of state-run markets has
been mixed.
The administration said an
additional 1 million individuals
have been found eligible to buy
coverage on the markets, with
about one-third qualifying for
tax credits to reduce their pre-
miums. Another 396,000 have
been found eligible for Medic-
aid, the safety-net program that
is shaping up as the health care
law's early success story.
For many Democrats, con-
cerns over the cascade of
website problems has been
compounded by the focus on
Obama's misleading promise
that Americans who liked their
health insurance plans could
keep them under the over-
haul. But millions of people are
receiving cancellation notices.
They have plans that for vari-
ous reasons don't qualify for the
law's "grandfather clause" pro-
tection against cancellations.
Obama has said he's sorry that
people are losing their coverage
and has vowed to find ways to
address "holes and gaps" in the
law. Advisers originally said the
White House was considering
administrative fixes, not legisla-
tive options.
On Wednesday, Obama
spokesman Jay Carney said, "If
we can achieve this administra-
tively, we will certainly look at
that possibility," but he added
that the White House was also
considering legislative ideas.
Senate Majority Leader

Harry Reid, D-Nev., sched-
uled an all-Democrats meeting
Thursday with White House
health care officials.
Republicans, meanwhile, are
holding hearings to keep the
overhaul's problems in the spot-
light ahead of an election year.
"It's kind of interesting to see
as Obamacare implodes how
everybody's running for cover,"
said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla.
And Senate Republican Leader
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky
said, "Obviously, panic has set
in on the other side."
The administration has
staked its credibility on turning
the website around by the end of
this month. From the president
on down, officials have said that
HealthCare.gov will be running
smoothly for the vast majority
of users by Nov. 30. They have
not specified what "running
smoothly" means.
The day was another blow for
the administration and its sup-
porters in Congress, who had
been counting on Obamacare as
a neutral if not winning issue in
next year's midterm elections.
Three more swing state
Senate Democrats seeking re-
election in 2014 signed onto
legislation drafted by Sen. Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana to ensure
that anyone liking their current
coverage would be able to keep
it, an attempt to resolve the
issue of cancellations.
In the House, meanwhile,
majority Republicans set a vote
for Friday on legislation to per-
mit insurance companies to con-
tinue selling existing policies
that have been ordered scrapped
because they fall short of cover-
age standards in the law.
On daily media calls, Health
and Human Services depart-
ment officials have described
a situation where problems get
fixed and then new issues crop
up as consumers are able to ven-
ture further into the website.
It's a bit like traffic heading back
to a city late on a summer Sun-
day: You get past one jam, and
odds are you run into another.

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford
admitted during a heated City

nearly every councilor to take a
leave of absence and get help.
"I'm most definitely keeping
this job," the 44-year-old Ford
said, insisting he was "a positive
role model for kids."
The mayor made the admission
under questioningby a former ally,
Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong.
Ford publicly acknowledged

Wednesday marked the first time

Symposium to highlight art

How do you bring down a dic-

Often, it requires the usual
tools: guns, bullets, bombs and
blood. But dictators can them-
selves grant rebels a powerful
weapon. Say, Bashar al-Assad's

in some Arab nations, protest-
ers and rebel fighters have been
using art as a weapon, both by
satirizing oppressors and com-
memorating sacrifices. This
Thursday and Friday, the His-
tory of Art department will be
holding a symposium dedicated
to analyzing and preserving the
art that has played such a huge
role in recent uprisings.
"Over the last two years, I've
followed really carefully all of
these events," said Christiane
Gruber, an associate professor
of Islamic Art and Visual Cul-
ture. "I followed street artists,
cartoonists, bloggers, journal-
ists, and when I saw just how
many people were active in the
uprisings through the expressive
media, usingall of these different
media, I thought it would be just
wonderful to put them in conver-
sation, to exit academia for just
a second and bring everybody
together."
This symposium on the
under-analyzed role of art, in

Business School, surveyed 109
part-time MBA students about
their conceptions of work.
"We don't necessarily under-
stand why people approach their
work in different ways," Dekas
said. "It's helpful for people to
reflect on what work means to
them - in other words, the main
things they hope to achieve or
experience through working -
and ensure they're making deci-
sions accordingly."
The study, to be published in
the 2014 volume of Research in
the Sociology of Work, suggests
that parents are the most major
influence on work orientation. It
also found that the participant's
religious culture and the stabil-
ity of a participant's industry
changed how he or she viewed
the work.
Baker said this aligned with
how parents impact other values,
such as political leanings. Ado-
lescence is a key time for parental
socialization to influence work
orientation, as one is still form-
ing their values but is old enough
to comprehend what values are.
Job, career and "calling" were
defined as the three career ori-
entations understood by indi-
viduals. Amy Wrzesniewski, now
an associate professor at Yale
University, established these
categories in her business Ph.D.
dissertation.
Those with a job orientation

work principally for a source of
income and are eager to retire.

the waiting list for organs is
3.5 times faster than the rate of
increase of deceased donors,"
Sade said. "While the waiting
list and number of deaths con-
tinue to grow, the number of
donors has essentially stabilized
over the last seven years. This
accounts for what has come to
be known as the organ gap."
Sade blames the National
Organ Transplantation Act of
1984, which made compensation
for organs a felony, for the lack of
organ donations in recent years.
"Over the last 30 years, the
only motivation that is legally
accepted is altruism; that is,
providing organs for no other
reason than the satisfaction of
doing something good," he said.
Toward the end of his lecture,

the Arab uprisings will feature
presentations from a diverse
group of activists, journalists
and academics, including CNN
correspondent Jill Dougherty
and Tunisian photo-blogger and
Nobel Peace Prize nominee Lina
Ben Mhenni.
"There has been interest in
the arts, but there hasn't been a
systematic study of how it's func-
tioning at the core of the upris-
ings," Gruber said.
"The more you look actuallyat
how thesethings are enacted and
activated, it's through banners,
it's through chants, it's through
posters, it's through digital art,"
she said. Along with live report-
ing, Gruber said these tools aim
to give a profile or shape to a
demonstration.
Much of the art that will be
discussed in the symposium is
street art, which has played a sig-
nificant role in the uprisings for
both practical and symbolic rea-
sons. If an artist in Libya wants
to make a statement to a whole
neighborhood, what better way
than to paint a humorous image
on the wall of a public square?
"If you see Gaddafi as a rat run-
ning away from extermination,
you don't need to explain all of the
different messages imbedded in
those images," Gruber said.
However, on a symbolic
level, street art is also a means
by which citizens reclaim the
spaces which government forces
may have seized. Even if some-
one spray-paints a giant smiley
face on a wall where a massacre
occurred, it still sends a message.
"The simple fact of putting
something up is about reclaim-
ing that public space as public,"
Career-oriented employees
might be seen as the typical
workaholic - they are eager to
climb the ranks and derive their
identity from their job. Finally, a
calling orientation leads people
to seek employment that posi-
tively affects others and fulfills
their own passions.
These orientations are largely
stable over a person's life, Dekas
said. For example, a father with a
career orientation is most likely
to raise a child with the same ori-
entation. Interestingly enough,
participants more closely mim-
icked their father's orientations
over their mother's.
However, this leaning maybe
influenced by the gender norms
surrounding most of the partici-
pants' adolescence. The average
age of survey participants was
31, and women were underrep-
resented in the working force
in the 1980s. More than half of
the working mothers of the par-
ticipants worked in health care
or education, fields that are not
characterized by career mobil-
ity compared to managerial
positions that the participants'
fathers may have held.
The researchers concluded
it was likely that fathers were
stronger occupational role mod-
els. Baker said he expected there
would be a difference in the find-
ings if the study if it were repeat-
ed in the coming decades.
Additionally, the report
found that distressed industries
force employees to shift to a job
or career orientation, as par-
ticipants employed in the auto
industry demonstrated. A big-

ger meaning in a person's career
Sade touched upon the ethical
standards of physicians, say-
ing that the most critical ethi-
cal principle of any physician
is trustworthiness given the
intimacy of relationships with
patients.
Before the lecture, Sade said
decisions regarding end-of-life
care were some of the most dif-
ficult he faced as a physician.
"One difficult problem that
still is a problem for me is when
you're taking a patient who's
sliding downhill and getting
sicker and sicker, and trying to
decide when is the right time to
discontinue life support," Sade
said. "Is it ok to help that patient
who's suffering badly and is not
going to survive?"
Sade also offered some advice
to pre-medicine students: the
major you choose as an under-
graduate does not make any dif-
ference whatsoever to medical
school admissions officers.

Gruber said.
Public satire has been par-
ticularly useful in destroyingthe
elaborate cult of personalities.
"There's nothing worse for an
autocratic ruler than to have his
charisma broken," Gruber said.
And dictatorsoreally are afraid.
Over the last several years,
several prominent cartoonists
and satirists have been beaten,
imprisoned and even killed
because of their art.
Gruber has seen this violence
firsthand. She spent the summer
in Turkey profiling and working
with protesters, who regularly
experienced police brutality.
Tear gas canisters were so ubiq-
uitous thatshe began to use them
as flower pots. That is, the tear
gas canisters that didn't land
next to her feet and engulf her
and other protesters in a suffo-
cating fog.
Like tear gas-canister flower
pots, much of the art of the Arab
uprisingsis improvised andspon-
taneous. For example, one Egyp-
tian protester in Cairo's Tahrir
Square made a necklace out of
empty shell casings, a weirdly
beautiful and uniquely powerful
retort to violence. However, this
symposium recognizes that what
makes this art powerful - how it
can pop up overnight, seemingly
anywhere, using anything- isn't
conducive to longevity.
"I think with street art, in
general, it is fleeting; it is ephem-
eral," Gruber said.
But for these artists, their art
has a significance beyond brief
existence.
"It's,'I live through art,"'"Gru-
ber said. "It's, 'I hope through
art.'"
might be ignored if layoffs are
looming.
"You may be a lot more
focused on getting a job where
you can make some money and
get by," Baker said.
Baker and Dekas also found
that individuals raised in com-
munities with a Protestant cul-
ture, such as the Netherlands or
Great Britain, were more likely
to have a job or career orienta-
tion. Baker links this correlation
to the change in attitude toward
work during the Protestant Ref-
ormation. She said that value
in working hard and advancing
in society is still cherished 500
years later.
"Work was no longer seen as
something you just had to do,"
Baker said. "Workinghard,being
frugal and investing wisely were
all considered to be almost spiri-
tual endeavors."
The researchers highlighted
the importance of learning one's
own career orientation and find-
ing employment that matched
it. Baker mentioned firms that
hire top undergraduates and
overwork them for a few years
with a high salary might pleasea
job-oriented person but alienate
those with a calling orientation.
Dekas affirmed the need for
some introspection to achieve
happiness in a work-crazed envi-
ronment.
"Are they looking for work
that will provide them with aslot
of money? Social status? Deep,
genuine fulfillment? Many peo-
ple look for all of these things,
but most people can isolate one
or two that are particularly

important."
"People who major outside of
the sciences, (those) who major
in history or art or economics
or philosophy, do just as well in
medical school as people who
major in chemistry or biology,"
Sade said. My best advice to pre-
medical students is to major in
whatever it is that turns you on,
and not necessarily in the sci-
ences."
After the lecture, Nursing
senior Kim Siebert said the idea
of monetary compensation for
organ donors is still question-
able in her mind.
"I think it's difficult because
if you were to try and puta price
on an organ, it's not going to
be easy. It's the same thing as
trying to put a price on a life."
Siebert said. "There are so many
different situational things that
you can think of, like why did
that person need an organ, or
how did the person giving an
organ feel about it?"

the activities shared resources
to contain spending, she wrote
it was difficult to separate how
much each individually cost.
"To achieve our audacious goal
of raising $4 billion, we need gifts
from hundreds of thousands of
donors," Malcolm wrote. "That
means we need hundreds of
thousands of people aware of and
engaged in the campaign."
The DTE Energy Founda-
tion donated $25,000 toward the
Community Festival, helping off-
set the costs of that event.
While the Office of Develop-
ment did not specifically track
gifts and pledges received over
the weekend, Malcolm wrote
that the events were intended
to thank donors for their recent
gifts, including $50 million from
Richard and Susan Rogel and
$200 million from Stephen Ross.
The purpose of the events was to
highlight those donations in order
to motivate other donors to begin
considering what they might con-
tribute to the campaign.
"Unlike a fundraising telethon,
acampaignkickoffis notdesigned
or intended to raise money at that
precise moment in time," Mal-
colm wrote. "The kickoff event
did, however, provide a focus and
urgency for fundraising."

serve alcohol at many fraternity
parties - includes preparation
for dealing with sick party-goers,
violent confrontations and crowd
control.
However, Andrew Koffsky, for-
mer president of AEPi, said in a
previous interview that he was less
convinced the sober monitor train-
ing could prevent such an assault.
"No 19 or 20 year old knows
how to deal with somebody who
has a knife and is trying to get into
a party," Koffsky said. "None of us
are trained to have mortal combat
abilities."
Stephen Siddall, risk manager
for the University's chapter of the
Chi Phi fraternity, echoed Koff-
sky's concerns aboutthe stabbing.
"I think it's really scary; it really
could have happened at any frater-
nity," Siddall said.
As risk manager, Siddall
approves plans for Chi Phi's par-
ties, works the front door and coor-
dinates up to 10 sober monitors
around the fraternity's property.
Siddall said he had little formal

training aside from shadowing
the previous risk manager. While
Siddall admitted none of his sober
monitors aretrained to deal with a
weapon, he said hiring additional
security - as some fraternities
have - would be overkill, and he
put the onus on guests for keeping
parties safe.
"People just need to understand
that fraternities are not throwing
open parties every night," Siddall
said. "Ninety-nine percent of our
parties are closed events."
But when fraternities plan

tapas and noodle house, have also
confirmed that they will set up
shop in the first floor of the space,
leaving one additional vacant spot
for a retailer or restaurant.
The University's School of
Information will fill the office

panied by PRIME Research. Bar-

could also be recognized as lead-

Malcolm wrote thatcJerry May,
the University's vice president
for development, spoke with five
potential donors over the week-
end who are considering gifts in
the $10 to 12 million range and
another six who are considering
gifts in the $5 to 10 million range.
She added that many deans used
the kickoff event as a way to close
donations in the run-up to the
launch. Over the weekend, the
deans were then able to use the
gifts already received to talk with
other potential donors about how
they could contribute.
The University has already
raised $1.7 billion of the $4 bil-
lion goal, which includes the gifts
from Ross, Rogel, Penny Stamps,
who donated $32.5 million to the
School of Art and Design in 2012,
and others.
"The goal of every event is to
thank the donors who contribut-
ed the $1.7 billion in the Nucleus
Fund and to inspire others to
give," Malcolm wrote.
Malcolm added that the Uni-
versity had succeeded in its goal
of getting its message out to at
least five million potential donors
over the course of the weekend.

partysecurity team as anecessary
investment.
K-9 Patrol, a risk management
consulting firm based out of Dear-
born Heights, Mich., has been
employed this year by the Univer-
sity's chapters of Sigma Alpha Mu,
Alpha Sigma and Alpha Epsilon
Pi. The company provides pre-
event guidance, onsite armed and
unarmed guards and post-party
consultations.
Timothy Schar, CEO of K-9
Patrol, said his guards are profes-
sional and act as a strong visual
deterrent to help reduce the
chance of an assault.
"We're not a companythatcgoes
and puts a bunch of 300-pound
gorillas out there with black
t-shirts that say 'security' on the
back, because that's not security,"
Schar said.
The company even deals with
angry neighbors through a hotline
designated for complaints.
Guards generally cost $280, and
most parties need between three
and five guards, depending on the

number of guests, Schar said. Most
fraternities spend between $1,000
and$1,500upfrontonhis company's
services, and there are no refunds if
a party gets shutdown, he said.
Still, the exorbitant costs
required to hire a company like
K-9 Patrol remain a strongenough
deterrent for some risk managers,
like Siddall.
"We haven't been asked to (hire
security), and that's an added cost
that we don't necessarily need,
and I really don't think its neces-
sary from a risk management per-

Interdisciplinary innovation
One-credit mini-courses give students exposure to real-world issues
The College of LSA, in partnership with student organization opti-
Mize, has proposed a new model to boost student-driven creative
innovation called the LSA Social Innovation Alliance. The pro-
gram proposes to support one-credit developmental mini-courses, an
annual Social Innovation Challenge, Summer Innovation Grants and the
creation of a 15-month SIA fellowship. Currently, LSA is seeking finan-
cial support of $4 million to endow the SIA program and about $200,000
annually. Given the positive response and demand from both the admin-
istration and the student population, the University should make this
program a priority and reach out to donors.

round this time of the year, a
single question preoccupies
the minds of many people:
Why is it so cold?
Unfortunately,
while many
people ask this
question out of
either pragmatic
concern or faux
existential grief,
many also fail
to see how pro- BARRY
found just such a BELMONT
question is. This
is due in part, I
imagine, to their misunderstanding
of how the whole process of "feeling
cold" works.
When pressed for an answer for
"why winters are cold," many people
often hem and haw about the earth
being farther away from the sun in
the "winter," thus receiving less light
and becoming colder. This is wrong.
This line of thinking exposes a bit
of northern hemisphere bias, since
the southern hemisphere experi-
ences summer while we have win-
ter. If we consider that the variation
in the orbital distance between the
earth and the sun is approximately
3,110,000 miles-whichisnearly800
times greater than the radius of the'
earth - we can see that all regions of
the earth are affected pretty much
equally by this variation. Therefore,
it's notthe cause of seasonal changes.
However, that seasons are hemi-
sphere dependent suggests an
answer, namely that the tilt of the
earth is the reason for the seasons.
And this is true as far as it goes. Since
the tilt of the earth remains constant
during the northern hemisphere's
winter, the northern hemisphere
points away from the sun. This angle
causes the sun to be lower in the
sky, heats the ground less efficiently
and shortens the days to bring on
the cold. But the "tilt of the earth"
answer always seemed a bit shallow

to me, as it fails to answer the more
interesting question: Why do we feel
cold? And as with most "why"-based
questions, there are both proximate
and ultimate answers.
The proximate, or most direct,
answer is that we don't feel cold. In
fact, human beings and other ani-
mals do not feel temperature at all.
What we actually sense is the flow of
heat caused by temperature differ-
ences. We feel "heat transfer." This is
not a trivial distinction. Everything
in a heated oven is at the same tem-
perature, but a cake pan will hurt
more to touch than the surrounding
air because the heat transfer from
the pan is rapid and intense, while
that from the air is slow and inef-
ficient. Heat transfer is the answer
to more questions than many could
have hoped to ask, and it tells us why
we feel cold.
In general, there are three main
types of heat transfer. The first, and
most intuitive, is known as conduc-
tion. Conductiveheat transfer occurs
when two objects of different tem-
peratures physically contact one
another. Heat energy from the object
with the higher temperature will
flow into the colder object until the
two are at equilibrium. This happens
when two people hold hands or when
a significant other asks to have their
cold feet warmed up.
The second type of heat transfer
is known as convection and is essen-
tially the same process as conduc-
tion, except instead of two solids
interfacing, one solid interfaces with
a fluid - either a liquid or a gas. Fans
feel good in the summerbecause they
push air across our skin and wick
away heat - in conjunction with
evaporation, another type of heat
transfer - and why they would feel
so bad to us in the winter.
Conduction and convection are
the primary causes of the answer to
why we feel cold. These are the two
modes that have shaped our physiol-

ogy and guided our evolution. They
are why the ears of rabbits are long,
why noses getcold to insure that the
rest of the body remains warm, and
why the genitalia of human males
are kept outside of their torsos. The
forces of evolution are mindful of
thermodynamics, if for no other
reason than that it is the law. We
feel warmth and coldness because
there is a higher evolutionary pres-
sure to determine differences in
temperature rather than absolute
temperatures to ensure survival.
Perhaps the least intuitive but
most important of the three modes
ofheattransfer is radiation, the pro-
cess by which energy is transferred
in the form of electromagnetic
waves. While conduction and con-
vection require a physical medium
to move heat about, all things, at
all times, are taking in and giving
off this radiative energy, with "hot-
ter" objects giving off more radia-
tion than they take in and "colder"
objects taking in more radiation
than they give off. This is the reason
we can feel the sun's warmth at all.
If we consider this fact, we can
come to our revelation: we feel
cold because space is cold. When
you step outside in the morning on
those winter days, you are feeling
outer space suck away your heat.
Every chill, every shiver, every
breath hanging in the air is directly
attributable to the cosmos's cold,
unfeeling nature. With an aver-
age temperature of approximately
-450 degrees Fahrenheit (roughly
-270 Celsius), space does not seem
particularly suited for the lives we
enjoy. Coldness is the rule, not the
exception.
In fact, instead of asking our-
selves why it gets so cold, maybe
we should ask, "why does it ever get
warm?"

The main opportunity SIA presents is.
the creation of new one-credit mini-courses
that will focus on critical, real-world issues,
like education. A one-credit mini-course
launched this academic year by LSA. With
a low-barrier to entry, the courses are an
appealing option for students with all types
of course loads. This new section filled up
extremely fast with a waitlist of seven people
and attracted a diverse group of students.
The demographics of the optiMize Social
Innovation Challenge last year included 50
percent LSA students, 28 percent Business
School students and 22 percent of students
distributed between other colleges.
The courses push students to devise prac-
tical, real-world solutions. The "Critical
Issues in Education" mini-course description
states that it aims to expose students to sev-
eral of the most pressing facets of a particular
social issue through presentations by guest
speakers. The speakers end their presenta-

tions with a challenge for the students to
design creative solutions to these problems.
Students will also have to work with oth-
ers within different majors and skill sets, as
well as apply their own experiences to create
innovative interdisciplinary solutions.
Aside from allowing students to network
with other similar-minded, passionate stu-
dents of different majors, the course also
provides students with business networking
opportunities with the speakers, who come
from various walks of life. However, the
program will need to draw on more outside
resources - like local non-profits - to fur-
ther expand and develop.
As social innovation increases by the hour,
this is a program that requires further develop-
ment and expansion. In a campus where words
like "pitches," "entrepreneurship" and "start-
ups" are thrown around in the air frequently,
it's necessary to also focus on the passion, drive,
and motivation behind entrepreneurship.

LE TTER TO THE EDITOR
Focus on men's mental
health in 'Movember'
TO THE DAILY:
This month of November, we in
Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices are promoting "Movember" - a
month focused on, and dedicated to,
men's mental health, and health and
wellness in general, as a complement
to our work with students the other
11 months of the year.
Men have a higher likelihood of
dying by suicide and engaging in sub-
stance abuse. One in six are survivors
of childhood sexual abuse. Simul-
taneously, men underutilize mental
health services, gravitate toward
"toughing" it out in private, and find

it easier to not ask for help.
Men's health affects all of us
regardless of our gender. We all have
men in our lives that we care about.
The stigma around accessing services
has impacted many of us personally
and professionally, and it's time to cre-
ateachange.
I urge all of us to create a caring
community and to do something to
helpsupportthis focusonmen'shealth
and to make it easier for men to ask for
help. Attend one of Movember events,
take time to educate ourselves, create
timetotalkwitheachother,keepiden-
tifying ways to be healthy, and more
importantly, to lay the foundation for
thefuture - ourfuture.
Most of all, I invite and urge us to
make men's mental health real in a
meaningful and personal way. I know

it's hard - I've been there - it's easy to
think these things won'thappento me
ortoanyone Icare about. But,thereal-
ity is that a health issue can happen to
all of us and/or to someone we care
about - I've beenthere, too. Thinking
back personally, I wish someone had
talked about men's health when I was
in college. That's how I make this real
for me and Iinvite allofus ta-ake this
real and personal.
Join us on the Diag on Nov. 14
from 12-2 p.m. to learn more. And,
join us in this effort as we collectively
try to make an impact with action,
with knowledge, with voice and
with support.

Here's what we're going to do in this arti-
cle. I'm going to pretend that I know a thing
or two about changing behavior, and you're
going to pretend to follow my advice.
Let me tell you about changing anything in
your life. First, you cannot expect a change in
results ifyou don't change the inputs.Whenyou
want your life to go in another direction, the
priority is in how you do it. The way to change
that "how" part is by realizing the difference
between the subconscious and conscious mind,
and observing the way they affect behavior.
Now if you haven't read Shakespeare's
Hamlet, go read it now. It will prompt you to
ask yourself whether you should live or die.
Make a list - assets and liabilities, pros and
cons, or just to live and to die - and assign
numeric points to the items on your list. Cal-
culate the points, and you will have seen
your choice.
If you've come back to read this article -
welcome back - I have started change in you.
Those who haven't followed the. instructions
will undergo no change as they haven't changed
any inputs in their equations - reading Hamlet
is not mandatory; just make the list.
What we've accomplished by compiling a
list of to live or to die was turning a subcon-
scious process into a conscious one. This is
the first step toward changing an outcome -
realizing what the heck is going on.
Going through the effort of seeing why
you choose to live is essential. While it seems
rather like a trivial task, it might in the end
reveal a couple of things about yourself. Also,
it's useful in the sense that it pushes you to
look at how you value "things" in life.
The second accomplishment of the test was
making a decision based on a conscious pro-
cess rather than a subconscious one. In this
case it was choosing to live and coming back
to finish the article. The first part was identi-

fication, and the second is deciding whether
your behavior makes sense or not.
Basically, just go repeat the process for
your addictions or whatever that is you want
to change. As a result of these two steps it will
be evident to you whether you should try to
get rid of a habit, or try to change it. Some-
thing is part of your subconscious because
at some point in your life you thought you
didn't need to question it. Since you now want
change, you have to question it.
The simple example is asking yourself why
you should quit smoking. It won't work if you
don't see the flaw in your own reasoning, and if
you don't see a problem in your conscious rea-
soning then you don't want to quit your habit.
Figuring out the flaw doesn't solve the
problem, right? You're convinced and you're
aware, but you lack initiative. Remember
what I said about assigning points? You lack
initiative because the values that add up to
your habit outweigh your desire for change.
Now, I can't dig into changing values
because that's a completely different psycho-
logical ball game, but what I can say is that
the more you question yourself the better it
is. So, my very narrow value add to your day is
this: don't take it for granted, go through the
process one more time, because somewhere
along the way you will see what matters more
to you, and that may become the initial spark
to change.
You have to review how you look at things
in order to get a new sense of evaluating
where you're at in life, and then you can begin
changing yourself.
TL;DR: To change behavioral outputs,
change input approaches and assumptions
first. To do this, make the effort to turn some
subconscious processes into conscious ones.

Choosing English over Engineering

A recent article in The New York
Times stated a fact most of us know:
The number of humanities majors
is declining. Harvard University's
humanity programs rake in 20 per-
cent fewer students than a decade ago,
and Stanford University's humanities
staff makes up 45 percent of the fac-
ulty population but only 15 percent of
students study humanities. This trend
stems from the focus on science, tech-
nology, engineering and mathematics
fields. This generation's college stu-
dents are especially concerned about
getting a job after college, and, there-
fore, students may choose science
over humanity majors, as they can be
seen as more attractive to employers.
However, students miss great oppor-
tunities in humanities departments.
As an English major, I can attest to the
value of my classes. The knowledge
that I learn isn't irrelevant, unimport-
antoruselessinthe job field.WhatI've
learned has been extraordinary and
beneficial in ways that STEM majors
can't offer.
I don't learn about derivatives,
programming or cells in English - I
learn about life. To study a novel or
essay is to study the complexities of
being human, which directly impacts
my opinions of humanity. I have
walked out of a 90-minute English
recitation genuinely feeling more
knowledgeable about life.
Take, for instance, the English
class I'm taking this semester. We're
currently learning about Virginia
Woolf, a novelist known for breaking
the rules of what defines a novel. In
Jacob's Room, she avoids develop-
ing plot and characters. By avoiding
vivid character descriptions, she illu-
minates her point on how little we

actually "know" someone.
In most novels, we know as
much as the writer can detail. In
real life, though, we don't know
people this well. We see them for
only a tiny fraction of their life, and
even at these points we are further
restricted by not having access to
their personal thoughts.
Prior to this class, I had never pro-
cessed how hard it is to actually know
someone. This idea, though, enhanced
myexperienceofthe world. It changed
how I thought about life. This type of
knowledge about humans rarely, if at
allcomesfromSTEM classes.
English not only helps me know
more about life - it also helps me to
express my thoughts. Through the
hours of discussions and papers, my
professors have honed my ability to
communicate effectively. When I'm
having an argument with a friend,
I know exactly how to express my
thoughts. By clarifying what I'm say-
ing, it can either diffuse a situation
or allow the person to better under-
stand why I feel the way I do. When
I open my iPhone to tweet a funny
story, after a few moments of revis-
ing, I've effectively used the right
words in the right places to convey
the story. When I'm e-mailing a pro-
fessor about a class question, I know
how to write professionally while
also specifically addressing my ques-
tion. This skill, honed by my English.
class, has helped me immensely.
But English isn't all about devel-
oping life skills. Contrary to popular
belief, the major has a strong basis in
preparing for career fields. It's abso-
lutelytrue that English does not desig-
nate you to a specific field, but it does
prepare you for a variety of fields. The

life and communication skills learned
from an English degree are invaluable
for a wide range of careers. An English
degree prepares students for careers
in journalism, sales, marketing, law,
publishing, editing, reporting, social
work, politics and teaching. That's not
the end of the list, though.
With such a wide range of skills,
some English majors find careers
in unexpected fields, including
accounting, banking, digital copy-
writing, public relations, blogging,
researching, sales, lobbying and
event planning. With these opportu-
nities and manymore, choosingEng-
lish does not also mean sacrificing a
career. In fact, with unending oppor-
tunities, English arguably provides
more opportunities for work than a
major that's bound to a specific job.
Now, I'm not devaluing choosing
a major in the STEM field. Everyone
has different interests, and sciences
and technology are vital. I'm thank-
ful for the medicine, technology
and infrastructure that come from
STEM majors. They're incredible,
and the people that major in these
fields enhance the world. However,
the value in these fields should not
minimize the value in English. I may
not have the skills to design a road,
diagnose a cold or create cardiovas-
cular tissue; however, I can express
myself and analyze literature better
than a good portion of people, and
that's what I find useful. Knowing
more about the human condition has
enhanced my personal life in a way
STEM classes can't. For me, my edu-
cation isn't just about finding a job.

PREVIEW

With the old Big East now dissolved, and the Atlantic Coast Conference claiming Sweet 16, including two which advanced to the Elite Eight, as well as Michigan making
some of the well-known teams, the once-popular debate of whether the Big East or Big the national championship game. This year, the Big Ten comes back with five schools
Ten is the best conference in college basketball seems to have taken a new direction. ranked in the Top 25.
While the ACC welcomes Final Four team Syracuse, the Big Ten comes back following Here's a breakdown of the upper echelon of competition the Wolverines will face this
a season in which four Big Ten teams out of eight NCAA Tournament squads made the season.

1. Michigan State
After being unanimously selected the Big Ten favorite by the media
heading into the season, the second-ranked Spartans showed on Tues-
day night why they are not only seen as the leaders of the Big Ten, but
of the country as well.
Taking on No. 1 Kentucky in Chicago, Michigan State demonstrated
its veteran savvy, defeating the Wildcats 78-74.
Returning six of their seven starters from last season, the Spar-
tans looked in midseason form as center Adreian Payne - a preseason
All-Big Ten member - tallied 15 points. Still, Payne was just the Spar-
tans' third-leading scorer behind guards Gary Harris (20) and Keith
Appling (22).
Harris, who considered entering the NBA Draft last year, returns at
100-percent health after being injured on and off last year. The sopho-
more was also named to the Preseason All-Big Ten team, adding to the
distinction of preseason Big Ten Player of the Year.
Assuming Michigan State doesn't lose to Columbia on Friday, it'll
take over the No. 1 national rank next week.
Though Big Ten play doesn't start until Dec. 31 for the Spartans,
they'll have a number of notable non-conference games in the near
future against No. 12 North Carolina in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge
and a tough road battle against Texas.

2. Ohio State
After an elimination in the Elite Eight by Wichita State, the
Buckeyes return this year with one player that has become the face
of the Big Ten over his past three years at Ohio State: Aaron Craft.
The senior guard and MVP of the 2013 Big Ten Tournament
comes back to Columbus for one last go-round to help lead a team
predicted third in the Big Ten.
After losing leading scorer Deshaun Thomas to the NBA Draft,
the 10th-ranked Buckeyes (2-0) will be tasked with replacing 19.8
points per game.
With the loss, even more pressure and responsibility will be
placed on Craft - the team's second-leading scorer from last sea-
son with 10 points per game - to be a scoring threat.
The Buckeyes will have junior forward LaQuinton Ross back, a
player that will step right into Thomas's starting spot. After aver-
aging 8.3 points off the bench in just 16.9 minutes of action last
season, Ross has already - albeit in a two-game span - improved
upon those numbers, averaging 12 points and seven rebounds in
26.5 minutes.
Of Ohio State's remaining non-conference games, three that
stand out are No. 17 Marquette, Maryland and No. 21 Notre Dame.

"I
3. Wisconsin
While Wisconsin's style of play - slow, stagnant, boring - may not
be popular to Big Ten fans, there is no doubt it works and will con-
tinue to work as long as Bo Ryan remains coach of the Badgers.
Though No. 20 Wisconsin (2-0) had one of its worst offensive sea-
sons under Ryan, the team still led the Big Ten in defensive efficiency,
and in effect, wore teams down in games - the Badgers held oppo-
nents under 50 points 10 times.
Returning for Wisconsin is forward Sam Dekker, a 6-foot-7 shoot-
er, proven by his 39-percent shooting from 3-point range and 9.6
points per game last season. His development and role will become
larger this year with the losses of Jared Berggren, Mike Bruesewitz
and Ryan Evans.
While they depart, coming back for the Badgers will be junior Josh
Gasser, who missed all of last year dueto a torn anterior cruciate liga-
ment. He'll share the backcourt with Ben Brust, who has averaged 13
points in Wisconsin's first two games, which were wins versus No.11
Florida and St. John's.
With a signature win already under its belt, Wisconsin's next and
perhaps only notable non-conference game will be against No. 25
Virginia on Dec. 4. Three days later, the Badgers will take on in-state
rival Marquette.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Ohio State point guard Aaron Craft has been one of the best players in the Big Ten for his entire four-year career.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Michigan State shooting guard Gary Harris was named the preseason Big Ten Player of the Year.

4. Indiana
After coming into last year ranked No. 1, things are a bit different
for the Hoosiers this time around.
Following a loss to Syracuse in the Sweet 16, Indiana returns to
action trying to replace 72 percent of last year's minutes. While it's
easy to remember that the Hoosiers lost forward Cody Zeller and
guard Victor Oladipo to the NBA Draft - they were both top-five
picks - Indiana also lost Jordan Hulls, Christian Watford and Derek
Elston to graduation.
The new names are four ESPN Top 100 players - as well as two
additional freshmen - that helped make up ESPN's fourth-ranked
class. From that six-man group, sure to make an immediate impact
is forward Noah Vonleh, who has produced two double-doubles in as
many games, while averaging 14 points and 12.5 rebounds.
Also sure to play a big role this year will be senior guard Evan Gor-
don - the brother of former Hoosier Eric Gordon, who is transferring
from Arizona State.
He'll occupy the backcourt with sophomore Yogi Ferrell, who will
have more of a leadership role with such a young team. After aver-
aging 7.6 points last year, Ferrell is off to a quick start, averaging 14
points through the team's first two games.
The Hoosiers' most notable non-conference games include a
matchup with Washington, at Madison Square Garden. Additionally,
Indiana will have a rematch against No. 9 Syracuse on Dec. 3 as part
of the ACC/Big Ten Challenge. The team's last noteworthy non-con-
ference game will be against Notre Dame as part of the Crossroads
Classic in Indianapolis. The Hoosiers suffered their first loss last
year there against Butler.

S. Iowa
Michigan wasn't the only Big Ten team to make it to a postseason
tournament championship game last year. The Hawkeyes also did,
losing in the title game of the National Invitation Tournament to
Baylor.
Despite missing out on the Big Dance, Iowa comes back with
much promise. Returning 12 players, the Hawkeyes will rely on
senior guard Roy Devyn Marble, who averaged 15 points per game
in his junior campaign. He'll be joined in the backcourt by sopho-
more Mike Gesell, who was the Hawkeyes' third-leading scorer last
year, putting up 8.7 points per game.
Iowa will have 7-foot-1 Adam Woodbury back for his second year
at center. After averaging just 16.5 minutes in his freshman year, a
goal for the 245-pound big man in the offseason was to put on more
weight to help himself battle down low in the bulk-filled Big Ten.
Probably the Hawkeyes' best player, junior forward Aaron White
will look to build off of his successful last season, in which he aver-
aged 12.8 points and 6.2 rebounds.
While Iowa has a deep roster coming back, a notable new player
is Wisconsin transfer Jarrod Uthoff, a former Iowa high-school Mr.
Basketball. After a much publicized transfer process, Uthoff will
more than likely be one of the first guys off the bench for the Hawk-
eyes.
Like a number of other Big Ten schools, one of Iowa's biggest
non-conference games is Notre Dame. But unlike Ohio State and
Indiana, the Hawkeyes are playing the Fighting Irish as part of the
ACC/Big Ten Challenge. Additionally, like Michigan, Iowa will play
at Iowa State.

6. Illinois
After faring much better than expected with current-Kansas State
coach Bruce Weber's players in his first year as the Fighting Illini
head coach, John Groce returns for his second season at the helm of
a suddenly young squad.
Illinois (2-0) started off hot last year, winning its first 12 games to
reach a high of 10 in the AP poll. Despite starting off slow in Big Ten
play, the Fighting Illini recovered to make the NCAA Tournament as
a seven seed.. After losing to Miami in the Round of 32, the Fighting
Illini come back to the court with just four returning players.
With guard Brandon Paul now gone, the bulk of the offensive duty
will fall on the shoulders of junior guard Tracy Abrams, senior for-
ward Joseph Bertrand and junior forward Rayvonte Rice, who will
be eligible to play after sitting out .last season following transfer-
ring from Drake. Rounding out the group of veterans is junior center
Nnanna Egwu Jr.
So far this season, the quartet has averaged 10-plus points each
through the team's first two games, with Rice leading the way with
17.5. Following close behind is Bertrand (17), then Abrams and Egwu
with 11 and 10, respectively.
Illinois' toughest non-conference games are against No.18 Oregon
on Dec. 14 and Missouri on Dec. 21.

Wolverines can't finish in
overtime against Xavier

Cyesha Goree
making a big
impression early

By LEV FACHER
Daily Sports Writer
After hitting a buzzer-beating
jumper to send the Michigan
women's basketball team into
overtime against Arizona on
Saturday, junior forward Cye-
sha Goree had the chance to do
it again with 3.4 seconds on the
clock, tied at 69 against Xavier.
But her luck didn't last -
her jumper from the top of the
key rimmed out and the game
went to
overtime, XAVIER 79
where MICHIGAN 75
Michigan
blew a four-point lead, eventu-
ally losing its home opener at
Crisler Center, 79-75.
It was clear from the start
that the matchup wouldn't be a
defensive battle. Just eight sec-
onds in, Xavier guard Ashley
Wanninger calmly drained a
straightaway 3-pointer, setting
the tone for a game that would
have been a barnburner had the
two teams shot better than a
combined 7-for-27 from 3-point
range in the first half.
But the game wasn't lacking
in shots. Junior guard Shannon
Smith came right back with a
mid-range jumper to make the
score 3-2, and the Wolverines
and Musketeers kept pace with
one another for the next 14
minutes, which saw Xavier fre-
quently hoist shots early in the
shot clock, most of which found
glass and iron, but not net.
The scoring picked up mid-
way through the half, when
three Musketeer 3-pointers
within a span of 78 seconds gave
them an eight-point lead. The
Wolverines, who'd been hanging
tough with Xavier offensively
for the first 12 minutes, turned
the ball over twice to leave the
Musketeers' scoring outburst
unanswered, but eventually
recovered to send the game to
halftime tied at 32.
Junior guard Nicole Elmblad
was dominant in the final min-
utes of the half, but Goree was
impactful throughout, putting

game-changer for the second
time in five days, but couldn't
convert, sending the Wolverines
into overtime for the second
time in as many games.
"She wanted it, she had a
great look, she had an open
look," Barnes Arico said. "That's
what we went with, and we had
a good look. We just didn't get it
to fall."
Despite failing to beat the
buzzer, Goree played the best
game of her career for Michi-
gan, putting up 16 points and
14 rebounds, to tally her first
career double-double.
Elmblad was equally impres-
sive. Her 19 points - also a
career high - and five assists
paced the Wolverines, and she
was a much-needed force on
the glass, as well, recording 12
boards of her own.
"We really stressed getting
three people to the glass and
trying to crash the boards,"
Elmblad said. "I think we did
a pretty good job with that at
times, but we still need to get
better."
Added Barnes Arico: "Nicole
and Cyesha are doing a great
job on the boards. My concern is
everyone else."
But the rebounding game
picked up as the game wore on
-'several Michigan offensive
rebounds early gave the Wol-
verines ample opportunity to
extend their 73-69 lead early in
the overtime period, but Mus-
keteers bounced back to take a
77-75 lead with less than a min-
ute left.
Barnes Arico took a time-
out after a kicked ball with 7.8
seconds remaining, and had a
second opportunity to draw up
a last-second play. But the Wol-
verines turned the ball over
on the inbounds pass, giving
Hawkes her second chance to
put the game out of reach from
the free-throw line.
After missing two just sec-
onds earlier, Hawkes regained
her composure and drained both
the second time around, sending
the Musketeers home happy.

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
After spending the first two
years of her Michigan career on
the bench, the 2013-14 season is
the time for junior forward Cye-
sha Goree to prove herself. In
her first start at Crisler Center
for the women's basketball team
Wednesday night, she didn't
waste any time showing Xavier,
or head coach Kim Barnes Arico,
what she has been working on.
While junior transfer guard
Shannon Smith earned the spot-
light for the first two regular-
season games, Goree was the
surprise playmaker early on in

minutes in her first two years
as a Wolverine, and in just three
games this season, she's got 97
minutes under her belt. For a
player who's had virtually no
playing time since her collegiate
career began, she showed confi-
dence in her shooting ability, as
well as leadership on defense.
"It feels pretty good just to
know that my coaches and my
teammates trust me," Goree said.
"Just knowing that we had a big
chunk of our program that left -
it made me want to work harder
and be ready to play however
many minutes coach plays me."
Barnes Arico knows she has
asked for quite a lot from her

Junior guard Nicole Elmblad set a career high with 19 poiots.

up 10 points to go along with five
rebounds and two assists.
Despite scoring only one
point in the first half, Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico
had Thompson - who came off
the bench for the first time this
season - on the floor to begin
the second in place of Ristovs-
ki. But the decision turned out
to be inconsequential as both
guards put up big numbers. Ris-
tovski finished with 12 points,
while Thompson added 11 in the
half to finish with 12 total, to
go along with seven assists and
seven rebounds.
"It was nice to see Madi-
son shoot the ball well again,"
Barnes Arico said. "She didn't
shoot the ball well when we
were on the road, so I think she

put some time into that."
Another small burst of scor-
ing from Elmblad put the Wol-
verines in front, 51-47, a lead that
Thompson quickly extended on
a difficult reverse layup, snaking
behind the basket and around
multiple Xavier defenders.
The game stayed relatively
even throughout the rest of
the second half, with Michi-
gan holding a slim lead that the
Musketeers chipped away at
consistently, finally making it
disappear on a Brianna Glover
layup that tied the game at 69

the Wolverines' 79-75 loss to
the Musketeers. In the first nine
minutes of play, Goree scored
eight points with two rebounds
and by the end of the first half,
led the team with 10 points, five
rebounds and an assist.
This past weekend, Michi-
gan earned its first win against
Arizona, a victory that wouldn't
have been possible without a
last-second attempt by Goree.
As time expired, she hit a turn-
around jumper, tying the game at
65 and sendingthe Wolverines to
overtime. Michigan was able to
pull out the 73-71 win, the team's
first overtime victory since 2008.
When Michigan trailed in the
last few seconds against Xavier,
Barnes Arico drew up the final
play for Goree, giving her the
responsibility to come through
for the Wolverines once again.
Unfortunately for Michigan, her
efforts weren't enough for a win
this time.
"I tell her to try and not get
too high or too low, because the
other day she was on top of the
world making the shot to send
us into overtime, and today she
misses the one to win the game,"
Barnes Arico said. "But she
wants to continue to work, and
I think her confidence is com-
ing from her working extremely
hard."
Goree played a total of 43

returning players, especially
those who hadn't seen much of
time last year. The team is in
transition; coping with the loss
of five seniors, preseason injuries
and considerable inexperience.
But so far, Goree in particular
has stepped up to Barnes Arico's
challenge of protecting the block
'M.'
Much of Goree's success can
be attributed to her dedication
to fitness during the offseason.
Barnes Arico has pointed out
more than once that her increas-
ing ability to make a difference is
clear, due in part to the fact that
she dropped 30 pounds over the
summer.
The Wolverines couldn't pull
out the win over Xavier, but
Goree racked up some personal
victories, finishing the game
with her first career double-dou-
ble - a career-high 16 points and
14 rebounds in 39 minutes. Her
early offensive contributions and
effort under pressure sent the
message that she's not to be a for-
gotten name this season.
Note: Barnes Arico announced
the Wolverines signed four
players to letters of intent on
Wedensday - guard Maria Back-
man, forward Jillian Dunston,
point guard Katelynn Flaherty
and forward Emoni Jackson. All
four are ranked in the top 120 of
the All-Star Girls Report.

After hate mail, Gardner says message ignored

By MATT SLOVIN
Managing Sports Editor
As the Michigan football team's
season has slowly deteriorated,
technology has allowed fans to
interact with Devin Gardner at a
moment's notice.
And as the losses pile up, the
redshirt junior quarterback pre-
sumably scrolls through his Twit-
ter mentions after a game and
sees hateful messages rolling in.
"When you play well, every-
body loves you," Gardner said.
"When you don't - I don't want
to say they hate you - but I get a
lot of hate mail. It comes with the
territory."
Wednesday night on his radio
show, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke called the comments direct-
ed at Gardner "classless."
Hoke said Wednesday that the
coaching staff tells players dur-
ing the recruiting process that
playing for the Wolverines means
dealing with the backlash when
things aren't going their way. If
players are unsure if they can fil-
ter out the outside noise, Hoke
tells them there are plenty of
other schools out there that might
be a better fit.
"No question," Hoke said.
"We're very honest with them.
We're demanding of them aca-

demically, socially and from the
football aspect. How they repre-
sent their name is really impor-
tant and how they represent the
block 'M.' "
Especially to the freshmen,
reading negative comments on
social media and hearing the boos
that rained down on the team
during last Saturday's 17-13 loss
to Nebraska can be particularly
impactful.
"This is all new, playing in
front of110,000," Hoke said. "This
is a whole different life in college,
not having mom's meals or grand-
ma's meals or whoever it may be.
There's abig adjustment."
The younger players will tell
Gardner thatthey'd like to reply to
the Twitter users bashing them,
who Gardner called "passionate,"
but he knows that wouldn't help
the situation.
So he tries to set the example,
asking them to come to him when
they feel like responding. Gardner
echoed a common sentiment this
week, saying the only people that
matter are the ones in the locker
room.
"I try mybest to explain that to
the young guys so they don't get
frustrated," Gardner said. "And I
think they understand now that
'wow, it is just about us.' No mat-
ter what anybody else says, good

or bad, it's about us. They'll love
you and they'll hate you."
Gardner's e-mail is unlisted in
the University's directory, which
he said helps to keep the messages
from coming to his inbox, too.
Gardner added that he doesn't
want to get into a conversation
via Twitter about his play but that
his reaction when he reads some
of the messages is, "Man, it sucks
you feel that way."
At halftime of the Nebraska
loss, fifth-year senior offensive
tackle Taylor Lewan addressed
the team, saying that even though
some fans have turned on the
team by booing, they need to con-
tinue playing for the 11 players on
the field. Those are the voice that
matter, Hoke said.
Filtering out the criticism will
be importantto finishingstrong -
the 10-win plateau is still within
reach, and though that was never
the original goal, Gardner said it's
still a mark of a strongseason.
"You've got to have broad
shoulders," Hoke said. "Any time
you're in competition, you're
going to have critics out there.
And 99 percent of those critics,
they don't know. They don't know
how these guys work, starting in
January after every season. The
early workouts, the grind we put
them through."

Michigan gets creative with numbers

Nation's top recruit
to decide Thursday

By DANNY VARGOVICK
For the Daily
Baseball has undergone a
revolution in statistics. Begin-
ning with Bill James's Baseball
Abstract in 1977, the new way of
using statistics has become wide-
ly accepted. The revolution has
even spread to other sports, such
as basketball, football and oth-
ers. It has become so mainstream
that it even hit Hollywood with
the movie Moneyball in 2011.
So why hasn't college baseball
kept up with the revolution in the
pros?
One reason is resources.
The Los Angeles Dodgers had
an Opening Day payroll of
$216,753,286 and can afford to
pay many people to work solely
on stats. In college, meanwhile,
the coaching staff - which
might consist of five people - is
in charge of everything from
coaching and scouting to recruit-
ing.
A second reason is the funda-
mental differences between pro-
fessional and college baseball.
Since conferences are relatively
isolated and have different levels
of competition, it is impossible
to normalize statistics from one
conference to another.
With these restraints, the
Michigan baseball team was
forced to get creative.
Michigan coach Erik Bakich
has focused on process-related
statistics. The idea is to quantify
how often players are doing what
the coaches want them to do, and
if they are, the results will even-
tually come.
For hitting, Bakich keeps track
of "quality at-bats." Each player
is expected to have a quality at-
bat 50 percent of the time.
"If 50 percent of their at-bats
are quality, then their batting
average is probably going to be
pretty good because they're
making a lot of hard contact and
doing a lot of things to help the
team win," Bakich said.
Added Bakich: "It's a statistic
that you won't find on any stat
sheet, and you won't find online."
It's a stat that's hard to quan-
tify, but it's an effective indica-
tor at the college level. The stat
is certainly subjective, but since

Bakich is the only person who
tracks the statistic, it works.
There are many different ways
that a batter can record a qual-
ity at-bat. Walks, hit-by-pitches,
sacrifice flies and sacrifice bunts
are always quality at-bats. But
it's slightly more complicated
for balls put in play. Hard-hit
balls that fall for hits obviously
qualify.
"If it's hit hard and caught,
it's a quality at-bat," Bakich said.
"If it's hit weakly and drops for
a hit, I ask myself, 'If that ball
was caught, would it be a quality
at bat?' and usually the answer
becomes apparent."
Bakich uses similar a meth-
odology for pitching. He expects
two out of every three pitches to
be quality pitches. Pitchers aim
to throw each batter only three
pitches, whether they retire
the batter or allow him to reach
base. This ensures that pitchers
are attacking hitters while on
the mound and limits their pitch
count. The coaching staff tracks
pitchers' strike percentage and
walks per nine inning, with goals
of two strikes for every three
pitches thrown and three walks
per nine innings, respectively.
For pitching, the same logic
persists. If pitchers execute their
pitches, throw, and limit walks,
they will likely be successful. In
the pros, statisticians can cal-
culate things such as fielding-
independent pitching, while
colleges only have the ability to
track whether or not pitchers
execute their pitches, with the
expectation that if they execute,
success will come.
While the hitting and pitching
statistics that the baseball team
uses are nothing like those used
by professional teams, there are
considerably fewer differences
between the levels for base run-
ning, making a lineup and scout-
ing opponents.
Forbase stealing, coaches time
opposing pitchers' times to the
plate, catchers' pop-up times and
throwing times and the time it
takes to apply the tag. That infor-
mation - coupled with knowing
their players' times from first to
second base with different leads
- allows the coaches to make
informed decisions on whether

gymnasium on
"Sports Dash
with Yahoo."
The 260-pound Virginia
native has been the most coveted
recruit for some time.
Hand jumped onto the scene
when he registered 21 sacks his
sophomore year and was one of
three rising juniors to partici-
pate in Nike's "The Opening," a
prestigious combine held Bea-
verton, Ore. The defensive end
brought that success into his
junior season with 110 tackles,
16 sacks, four forced fumbles and
40 tackles for a loss.
This dominance earned him

more than 30 scholarship offers,
but only one school has stayed
in his top three throughout the
whole process - Michigan.
If he commits, Hand would
become Michigan's 16th commit-
ment of the 2014 class and would
create history. If the current
rankings hold, Michigan would
have verbal commitments from
the nation's No. 1 and the No. 2
prospects in Hand and corner-
back Jabrill Peppers. No team
in history has ever earned the
commitments from the top two
prospects.
Hand would join five-star
Bryan Mone, four-star Lawrence
Marshall, and grey-shirt com-
mit Brady Pallante, creating one
of the best defensive line classes
Michigan has seen.
Defensive line aside, Hand's
commitment could give Michi-
gan its greatest class ever.
The Wolverines have had their
fair share of struggles creating
quarterback pressure, buta com-
mitment from Hand could poten-
tially change that.
Hand projects as a strong-side
defensive end, a position cur-
rently occupied by junior Bren-
nen Beyer, redshirt freshman
Chris Wormley and redshirt
sophomore Keith Heitzman.
Hand would certainly put him-
self in the mix for early playing
time.
Michigan football can make
recruiting history at noon
Thursday, and it rides on Hand's
decision on whether to become a
Wolverine.

Michigan baseball coach Eri k Bakich has created stats to evaluate players.

or not they should steal.
Most casual fans know that in
general, hitters who get on base
often hit at the top of the order
and powers hitters hit near the
middle-there's no need to over-
think this. Bakich agrees with
Oakland Athletics General Man-
ager and founder of "Moneyball"
Billy Beane that on-base percent-
age is more important than aver-
age, and the lineup that Bakich
creates is likely no different than
one any MLB manager would
come up with.
Perhaps the most underval-
ued contribution of statistics in
baseball is in scouting upcoming
opponents.
"We spend an incredible
amount of time compiling our
scouting reports," Bakich said.
"It takes us a few days to put all
the information together for a
15-20 minute meeting with our
team."
Bakich knows opposing pitch-
ers' and hitters' lefty-righty
splits; opposing hitters' batted
ball tendencies; opposing pitch-
ers' tendencies to predict what
pitches they throw in certain
counts; and how both teams' hit-
ters have fared over their last
ten games. And while the pros
undoubtedly take these concepts
to a higher degree, the similari-
ties between the two levels are
much greaterthan those for eval-
uating hitting and pitching.
In hiring Bakich, who is the

youngest head baseball coach at
a BCS school, Michigan made a
commitment to new-age think-
ing.
"There are some teams that
don't really utilize scouting
reports and aren't really con-
cerned with what the statistics
show," Bakich said. "I think
there's some teams out there that
just kind of show up and play and
win doing that."
Bakich has shown that he will
use statistics to the best of his
ability, even if that ability in col-
lege pales in comparison to that
of the pros.
"Comparing professional and
college baseball, there is no com-
parison with the information
available and the commitment
to compiling those statistics,"
Bakich said. "In college, a lot of
it is just the coaches doing what
they can with the information
they have."
Where professionals can
turn to stats such as weighted
on-base average, which weighs
walks, singles, doubles, triples
and home runs by their value to a
team, college baseball makes do
with stats such as quality-at-bat
percentage.
Bakich says it works because
Michigan's players buy into it.
"In all areas of our program,
there's a focus on process over
outcome, thinking that the out-
come will come by focusing on
the process," Bakich said.

Wolverines exit
in Big Ten second
round, season could
be over
By FREDDY KASTEN
For the Daily
Twenty-five shots, one over-
time, one golden goal, and
one magnified loss - that was
the action-packed story of the
Michigan men's soccer game on
Wednesday.
Indihna INDIANA 2
(3-4 Big MICHIGAN 1
Ten, 7-11-1
overall) likely ended the Wolver-
ines' season in a hard-fought 2-1
victory, advancing to the second
round of the Big Ten tourna-
ment. The victory came nearly a
month after Michigan beat Indi-
ana, 2-1, at U-M Soccer Stadium.
Michigan started the game
well, as senior defender Ezekiel
Harris netted a goal in the 10th
minute, but after that, Indiana
outshot the Wolverines consider-
ably. Redshirt junior goalkeeper
Adam Grinwis played stoutly
in net, nonetheless, keeping his
team in the game early on while
turning away all four shots on
net in the first half.
"Adam came up with a couple
good saves to keep us ahead,"
said Michigan coach Chaka
Daley. "But saves that we expect
him to make so they weren't out
of the ordinary."
The Wolverines (3-4, 8-7-3)

A history lesson on
hip- hop's hype men

SPOTIFINDS
Daily Arts Writers dig through recent
Spotify releases to find the tracks worth
revisiting or discovering.

f you've ever been to a hip-
hop show, you've probably
noticed that guy jumping
around next to your favorite
rapper, barking out the last few
words of
every lyric
and pumping
up the crowd
with the
usual "wave
your hands
side to side"
or "somebody JACKSON
scream!" HOWARD
This guy, the
hype man,
has been an integral part of hip
hop since its inception in the
late 1970s. The concept of a hype
man makes perfect sense for
rap culture, as freestyling and
battle-rapping - two of the most
basic forms of hip hop - are as
dependent on the cheering of the
crowds as they are on the indi-
vidual lyricist's ability.
Flavor Flav for Public Enemy,
Spliff Star for Busta Rhymes,
Tony Yayo for 50 Cent and Mem-
phis Bleek for Jay-Z are just some
examples of hype men who have
played important roles in rap-
per's performances. For Wu-Tang
Clan, every member doubles as
both a rapper and a hype man,
while producers such as Swizz
Beatz, Jermaine Dupri, Lil Jon
and Diddy all play hype man-
like roles on the stage and in the
studio.
On the other hand, hype men
can get boring and annoying. I've
been to countless rap shows, and
it's always refreshing when a rap-.
per performs without his hype
man or DJ yelling every other
word. Today, rappers continue
to use hype men on stage. In the
booth, however, it's a different
story, as hype men have never
had the same presence in the stu-
dio as they have on stage. Instead,
it's on the artists to pump them-
selves with double-layered vocals
and, most importantly, random,
shouted ad-libs.
Many popular rappers use
their own catch phrases as
momentum trampolines for
their own rhymes. Jeezyuses
a plethora of cryptic, smoker's
lung-sounding shouts after his
verses, while Rick Ross's guttural
unghhhh and barks of "BAWSE"
can be expected on almost every
song. Waka Flocka deserves
recognition for his insane use of
"WAKA," "BOW BOW BOW"
and repeated self-made gun
sounds, while Gucci Mane will
forever be known for his trade-
mark "BURRRR" and "Yeahhhh-
hhh." Ad-libs like these, such as
Big Sean's "Oh Gawd" and French
Montana/Kanye's "Hannnnnnh,"
give artists signature identifiers
and provide more emphasis to
each verse.
Southern rappers in particular
- Jeezy, Ross, Gucci Mane, etc.
- have a particularknack fornot
only creating repeated ad-libs, but
also for shouting outhilarious and
threatening back-up vocals that
pertain specificallyto the lyrical
content itself, not just a random

"Metropolis?" and it's not really

if he's just egging Drake on.

shouts out, "Don't ask for my
opinion," warding off potential
questioners in case Drake's mes-
sage wasn't clear enough.

ARTPOP - Lady Gaga
The tracklist alone for ARTPOP seems like a
work of bizarre Gaga performance art in and of
itself. "G.U.Y."? "MANiCURE"? "Fashion!"? What
is this album? After a first listen-through, you
won't have many answers. ARTPOP has moments
of classic Gaga pop and moments of ... something
entirely different, including a confusingly trappy
track featuring T.I., Too $hort and Twista. Though
it lacks cohesion, ARTPOP on the whole outshines
its Top-40-ready lead single, "Applause." Feel free
to skip that one during your full-album listen.

WARNER BROS
"Perfume" - Britney Spears
Whereas the heavily EDM-influenced "Work
Bitch" shows off Britney's bad side, "Perfume"
is a stripped-down Britney ballad that's more
"Lucky" than "Toxic." The lyrics are admittedly
simplistic and schmaltzy, but there's an emo-
tional vulnerability to "Perfume" that makes it
clear why Britney herself said releasing the song
feels like she's sharing a piece of her heart. If
nothing else, "Perfume" at least seems to be the
perfect material for alate-night karaoke session
fueled by alcohol and feels.

WARNER BRoS
"All Bad" - Justin Bieber
In his latest Music Mondays gift, J.Biebz goes
on the defensive, most likely in response to the
tabloid troubles the teen has faced lately. Regard-
less of whether his apologetic words are true
or not, it's a catchy track, a slice of post-R&B
moodiness that marks a departure from his more
bubblegummy Believe hoppers. Airy instrumen-
tals and whispery vocals lend to the bleak angst
Bieber is really driving home with his most recent
work. Hey, it's really not so bad.

PARAMOUNT
"A World Alone" - Lorde
Every time you start feeling bad about your-
self, just think about the fact that Lorde is 17
years old and probably more talented than you'll
ever be. With a stark guitar line and breath-
taking vocals, "A World Alone" is the perfect
closer for her debut studio album, Pure Heroine.
The teenaged art pop princess croons, "You're
my best friend and we're dancing in the world
alone," perfectly capturing the introspective
tone of the whole album.

Musicians busk
for a living on the
streets of A2
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
Daily Arts Writer
"I like the piano; I like the
sound of it, although the pedal
squeaks," Al Skinner said, run-
ning his hand along the top of
the piano in the Michigan Union
Art Lounge. "And it has squeaked
over the last two years. I don't
know why they don't fix it.It's like
a $200,000 piano. Why wouldn't
you fix the squeaky pedal?"
About 20 minutes earlier,
Skinner had sat down at the
piano in a silent room. A few stu-
dents perched on couches and at
tables, with their books and lap-
tops out. Every turn of a page was
amplified by hollow acoustics
until Skinner started in on the
piano. Next to him, Lou Rockin-
feller sang. Skinner covered the
squeaky pedal by playing forte
as Rockinfeller belted Journey's
"Open Arms." Their music envel-
oped the room as notes over-
lapped in echoes, bouncing off
the tiled floor.
Skinner and Rockinfeller are
homeless musicians. Skinner said
he has been coming to play at this
piano in the Union for about 20
years. Rockinfeller calls himself
"a drifter," just passing through
Ann Arbor. As the weather chills,
he'll move on.
They all got their start with

Rockinfeller agreed. He said
music has helped him travel the
country and even international-
ly. He told of the time he toured
with a punk band on a two-week
tour of Spain. After the time
was up, the band's record label
said it was time to go back to
the United States, but Rockin-
feller said he and his bandmates
weren't quite ready.
"I don't even need your label.
I'm gonna do it just on the
kindness of the Spaniards," he
recounted. "And the Spaniards
kept saying, 'Dnde estis que-
dando?' Where are you staying?
And then I said, 'You know man,
we don't really have a place to
stay. We're going to stay in the
car.' And no, no, no, 'Tn vas a
quedar aqu.' You're going to
stay here. With us."
The three musicians all
agreed that music is special in
that way. No one can say they
don't enjoy some type of music.
It's a unifier, and Chavez said
that's one of the rewards of bus-
king.
"When somebody comes up,
even if they don't have anything
to give, they're interested and
they're impressed and they seem
to care," he said. "I've never
been one to strive for attention,
but at the same time, it's fun to
go and stand on the street corner
and find the people who care."

to school, because - ' " overcome
with laughter, she had to stop and
collect herself. "The one-and-done
thing just never - "
"Crossed our minds. And it
shouldn't have crossed his," Craw-
ford cut in, finishing her daugh-
ter's sentence.
"I was just like, 'No way you
think you can go and play LeBron
(James) and Kevin Durant.' I know
you don't think that. I think he
thought that, but I was thinking,
'No way,' "Clay-Irving said.
Though Robinson was unani-
mously projected to be a lottery
pick, Brumm saw a brighter future
ahead. He warned Robinson that
NBA teams were "just wanting an
athlete ... somebody who he really
isn't."
As soon as he committed to
staying at Michigan, the rising
sophomore went to work in a way
that those close to him had never
seen.
Clay-Irving doesn't recall him
even taking a day off.
Each summer morning, his

alarm was rarely set anylater than
6 a.m., and he'd head straight to
gym to get up at least 500 shots.
A few hours later, he'd work with
Brumm and sometimes a then-
healthy McGary. A quick nap
preceded workouts and lifts -
including making the 45-minute
tri-weekly treks to see Wallen -
and then he'd return to the court
for more practice. In between, he'd
find time to watch game film and
cook. (Even at school, where team
meals are freely available, he cooks
almost all of his meals to adhere to
Wallen's dietary restrictions for
him.)
"The way he approached every-
thing was all about one mission,"
Wallen said. "Usually the saying
is, 'Hard work beats talent when
talent doesn't work hard,' butI tell
Glenn he's both."
It showed. When Robinson
arrived back in Ann Arbor for pre-
season physical tests, his vertical
jump was literally off the charts (it
exceeded the Vertec vertical-jump
measuring machine's maximum of
12-foot-3). And, after making pre-
season visits to Michigan, Michi-

gan State, Indiana and Kansas,
ESPN's Jeff Goodman said that
Robinson was "the most impres-
sive player" he came across.
But the offseason results tran-
scended just the court.
"This preseason, he has been
more vocal than ever," Beilein
said. "He's got the ear of our locker
room right now. That doesn't come
natural to people sometimes.
"It says a lot about where his
comfort level is."
Added McGary: "I think, he's uh
- " the forward paused to collect
himself, "slowly becoming a man. I
don't think he's gonna stop."
Neither does Brumm.
"I think he's mastered the phys-
ical aspect of the game. He's still
developing, maturing," he said.
"I'm not sure you or I really know
how good he is.
"Glenn's going to keep going
until his body starts breaking
down. I think he will get bored
with basketball before that day
comes.... I don't think he'll ever get
to that phase where someone says,
'OK, you're not good enough."'

Robinson has heard you.
And so far, he's answered with
at least incremental improvements
about each of his doubts while in
Ann Arbor. But to put it all togeth-
er - the leadership, the tough-
ness, the all-around player who
will step up instead of passing up
- is the key to Michigan's season,
and that's not something that'll be
judged in the immediate future.
It's a question best answered in
March.
And Robinson knows that. He's
heard it - he's a listener, remem-
ber.
You'll never be the guy.
It's something he thinks about.
Sitting in a dimly lit room over-
looking State Street on a gloomy,
rainy, late October afternoon, Rob-
inson is asked if he wants to be the
guy with the ball in his hand with
the game on the line.
"Oh yeah," he pauses to take
a sip from his Starbucks cup.
The regular-season opener was
more than a week away, but for a
moment, it appeared his thoughts

had shifted to the past. To the
times he has done it before.
There was the game winner
that he hit from half-court in his
freshman year. And the game in
his junior year when he scored 29
points in his team's playoff opener.
He "wasn't going to school the
next day if we lost," so he won - it
was the first high-school game his
father ever saw him play in.
But then there was the game two
days later against undefeated No. 1
Munster. With less than seven sec-
onds remaining, Robinson missed
a game-tying 3-pointer. He got the
rebound, though, and drilled it.
"I don't think anyone realized it
was just to tie the game," so fans
stormed the court. But the ela-
tion ended minutes later when he
missed the back-end of a pair of
free throws that would've sent the
game into double overtime, ending
his season.
"Yeah," he says. He sets his
drink down. His answer comes
without a smile, or attitude, or
even any sense of absolution. Just
the same emotionless, quiet Glenn.
"I need tobe."

Apre-emptitve salute to the Fresh Five

Glenn gets enough credit. I think
even sometimes the (Michigan)
coaching staff maybe thinks Glenn
was always this way. They think,
'Oh, he's the son of Glenn Robin-
son, so of course.' No, he wasn't.
He wasn't really good as a sopho-
more to be quite honest."
You'll never be like your dad.
If there was one 'Big Dog' grow-
ing up in Shantelle Clay-Irving's
house, it certainly wasn't her son
Glenn.
"Everyone wants Glenn to have
this Big Dog, this urgh - " Clary-
Irving paused to growl, clenching
her teeth and fists, "in him. I just
don't think Glenn has it. His dad
came from the hood - he had to
have it. Not (Glenn III), and I don't
think he'll ever have it.
"He doesn't want be his dad, he
doesn't want to have that. And I
don't want him to have it."
Robinson's brother Gelen, the
football and wrestling star who
will play linebacker at Purdue next
year, was born with that mean
streak and, according to Clay-
Irving, always wanted to be the big
brother.
Glenn's lack of emotion, his abil-
ity to remain calm and composed
through the highest highs and the
lowest lows, has become his trade-
mark personality.
"I could say, 'Uncle so-and-so
died,' and he'd go, 'Oh really?' "his
mom said, shrugging her shoul-
ders and dropping her voice to a
monotone in mockery of her son.
"There's just no emotion. When I
say boring, that's him."
Glenn was always taller, but
even from a young age, Gelen was
bigger, stronger, and according to
Wallen, an "I'm-gonna-rip-your-
head-off type of guy," which made
for an interesting dynamic in the
brothers' competitive relationship.
"Nothing much can get him
riled up," Gelen said. "That would
sometimes irritate me that it's
hard to get under his skin. For me,
being the complete opposite, itgets
frustrating."
In hindsight, Glenn appreciates
his brother's "annoying" antics
because it constantly tested his
ability to remain stoic.
But for as good as Glenn is at
keeping his emotions under wraps,
he's even better at internalizing
things in order to fuel his passions.
He's aware of his insecurities,
Brumm says, and they're what
make him "get up in the morning."

In the middle of high-school
workouts, Wallen repeatedly
reminded Glenn that he was
passed up by the in-state schools,
and by the McDonald's All-Amer-
ican game, or that he finished fifth
in Indiana's Mr. Basketball vote.
But nothing has persisted more
than his strive to reach his dad's
level.
In his first year playing for Pur-
due, Glenn Jr. averagedbetter than
25 points and nine rebounds per
game. The following season, he
was named National Player of the
Year.
And no one ever confused 'Big
Dog' for lacking assertiveness, or
being passive about anything -
critiques that have followed the
younger Glenn from high school to
Ann Arbor.
Everyone quoted in this story
agreed that the reputation is at
least partially a misconception -
that his calm demeanor is mistak-
en for apathy.
But still, those closest to him
have wanted to see more from him.
Said Bartelstein: "He's not a guy
who's ever going to show a ton of
emotion, but there were times last
year when he needed to kind of
take a stand and show some more
toughness."
Added his mom: "Last year, I
think he thought that was maybe
more so (Burke and Hardaway's)
year. I just don't think he wanted
to step on anyone's shoes."
Brumm, who still talks to Glenn
multiple times a week, was par-
ticularly blunt. Dating back to his
early years in Brumm's program,
Robinson has had the tendency
to defer on open shots in favor of
passes, and especially early on,
failed to take over a game, even
when the opportunity was there
for him as the most talented, hard-
est-working player on the floor.
It's a problem that teammates
and coaches at Michigan have
been getting on Robinson about
since his earliest scrimmages in
Ann Arbor.
This year, Michigan lacks
a proven go-to scorer that can
replace not only Burke and Hard-
away's combined 25 shots, but also
their ability to create for them-
selves and teammates with the
game on the line and the shot clock
running down. Today, Brumm
says, that's where Robinson has
the most area for improvement.
"That's his battle," Brumm said.
"I think he perceives, 'I'm going to
play my role,' and really, maybe his
role is supposed to be to take that

shot, or go in there and dunk that
on somebody, you know? Don't
defer."
You're not a leader.
For someone who thrives on
proving doubters wrong, Robinson
said the announcement that he had
been named a team captain was
"definitely" vindicating.
He becomes just the program's
fourth sophomore to receive the
honor but said it's something he
knew the team needed him to do.
"I wanted this," he said. "It's
my job to step up and be a leader. I
expected to be the captain."
While the decision surprised
many outside the program, who
pointed to his quieter demeanor,
it wasn't shocking to his previous
coaches.
Robinson didn't just lead Lake
Central in scoring for three con-
secutive years, he out-worked each
and every one of his teammates.
Today, that leadership is still
reverberating in the school's gym
each morning, when six to seven
players get up at 5:30 a.m. com-
pared to the one or two that would
sometimes join Robinson in earlier
sessions.
Nothing got Brumm more fired
up than when Robinson's leader-
ship was brought into question.
"He leads by example. To me,
that's more important," Brumm
said. "I'm not into this rah-rah
leadership, because it can some-
times be mistaken for real leader-
ship."
It perturbs Brumm that some
close to Robinson fail to see past
his visible emotions.
"Glenn is a thinker. Don't mis-
take Glenn's facial expressions for
not caring," he said. "I think some
people - I'm biting my tongue
because I'm not going to say who
- there's a lot of people that really
don't understand Glenn Robinson.
"It bothers some people when
Glenn doesn't tell you what he's
thinking, but that doesn't mean he
doesn't care."
Brumm spoke of Robinson's
leadership for nearly 10 consecu-
tive minutes, wrapping it up by
saying that, "If people don't under-
stand who Glenn is, that's their
weakness."
In Ann Arbor, it seems folks are
finally understanding, even begin-
ning to embrace, the Glenn that
people in Indiana know and love.
Bartelstein, along with Hard-
away, were two of the veterans

that took Robinson under their
wings the most.
"He's becomea celebrity in Ann
Arbor. At first, I think all of atten-
tion kind of got to him - didn't get
to him in a bad way - he just didn't
know what to do," Bartelsein said.
"But he accepts that and is com-
fortable with it now."
You're soft.
Throughout last season, Robin-
son was left in the corner to oper-
ate in only a residual fashion. Early
in the season, as teams attempted
to limit Burke, Robinson's defend-
er helped on the pick-and-roll, and
Robinson was left with open jump
shots and dunks. Big Ten coaches
adjusted their defenses to stymie
Robinson.
"And that's when all the nega-
tive things started to happen," he
recalls.
Michigan finished 3-4 in Feb-
ruary, as Big Ten teams repeat-
edly exploited the Wolverines and
what some perceived to be a lack of
toughness. At just 6-foot-6, Robin-
son was overmatched and bullied
in the paint.
"Guess what happened?"
Brumm asked rhetorically. "Glenn
didn't get as many touches. His
production went down, and people
say he's soft."
Fans turned on Robinson, and
while he said all the right things
publicly, those close to him noticed
some frustration.
"He sort of played out of his
position, and I don't think he was
satisfied with that," said his grand-
mother, Carolyn Crawford.
Added Bartelstein: "I think it
got under his skin a little bit. I
think he was frustrated. He want-
ed to get more shots in the offense
and didn't know where his next
shot was coming from."
Michigan finished the year 22-2
when Robinson scored in double
figures, and heading into the
NCAA Tournament as the nation's
favorite upset pick, he quickly
asserted himself.
After a scare in the first half
against South Dakota State, Rob-
inson's back-to-back-to-back
3-pointers to open the second half
lifted Michigan.
"You've got to get that little kill-
er in him that when someone's try-
ing to push him under the basket,
you've got to push back a little bit,
and I think he got that at the end of
the year," Bartelstein said
His production in the NCAA

Tournament pointed to a positive
outlook for this season, said Craw-
ford.
"I think he laid back a little bit
last year, but I think he'll be tough-
er this year."
You're nothing more than an
athlete.
Though Kansas's biggest lead,
14, came three minutes before the
timeout speech, it seemed any
multi-possession deficit would be
too much for Michigan to over-
come. The Wolverines were find-
ing ways to score but couldn't
put together a string of defensive
stops.
With the two teams trading bas-
kets, McGary was fouled to initiate
the game's final media timeout.
The coaches huddled together,
diagramming plays, while the
players bickered a few feet away.
With established veterans like
Hardaway and Burke joining five
seniors on the team, members of
Robinson's inner circle admit-
ted that he'd perhaps been wary
of stepping on any toes. But, as
Crawford put bluntly, "He had had
enough. He wanted to win."
McGary called the speech "cou-
rageous."
"He just finally said, 'You know,
screw it,' and said what he had to
say after maybe holding things in
the whole season," Albrecht said.
"The thing is, when Glenn steps
up and speaks like that, guys listen
because you know it's important."
"It was an 'aha!' moment. Every-
one in the huddle looked around
and was like, 'Wow,' " Bartelstein
said.
In the final 3:47 of regulation,
Robinson's words paid dividends;
Kansas was held to just one field
goal and committed three turn-
overs. Less than a week later, he
was on a flight to Atlanta.
Following the loss - which
Robinson says he'll never watch
- Beilein asked his players if
anyone would like to speak. Ten
days after the huddle, Robinson -
overcome with emotion - again
raised eyebrows by being the first
to volunteer. His speech, a thank
you to the seniors and veterans
that were prepared to leave, set
the table for a promising sopho-
more season.
But in the ensuing days, reports
surfaced that he and McGary were
testing the NBA Draft waters -
that was, until Robinson called his
mother and grandmother.

egacies are funny. You
can't anoint them until
time has passed, but at that
point, you can't enjoy them in the
moment.
Solution: Recognize the legacy
in the present. This group of
Michigan
sophomores,
known
affection-
ately as the
Fresh Five,
has just one
more year
left together, NEAL
so enjoy it ROTHSCHILD
while you
can. It will
last at most five months more.
The recruiting.class of 2012 is
extraordinary. An aberration. A
remarkable assembly of big-name
cachet, underdog status and ser-
endipity.
There's not a non-descript one
among them. Each has carved a
persona that fans can relate to.
Like the Justice League superhe-
roes. Mitch McGary is the quirky,
enthusiastic beast on the pick-
and-roll, Glenn Robinson III the
quiet, assassin-like freak athlete.
Spike Albrecht is the charmed,
pocket-sized wonder. Nik Stauskas
is cocky and prone to slap the floor
or throw up 3-goggles on a regular
basis. Caris LeVert is understated,
a rail-thin marvel of an athlete.
He's soft-spoken and still sports
braces.
This group hasn't had the cul-
tural impact of the Fab Five, but its
effect on the direction of Michigan
basketball is comparable. And as
far as we know, it won't cripple
the program for the next 15 years.
They didn't need to bring a sense
of swaggering hip hop to the bas-
ketball scene to leave a profound
impact.
The Fresh Five has brought a
sense of permanence to Michigan
basketball. The Trey Burke era may
very well have been a two-year
run of success before the program
fell back to reality. But McGary,
Robinson and Co. have bridged the
gap to the future. They're making
sure the Big Ten Championship
and Final Four appearance weren't
a fleeting snapshot of Michigan
glory.
Where just a year ago, the five
were new to campus, learning from
the upperclassmen, a year later
they're the team's leaders. Aside
from McGary in the post, they're

The sophomore class is a rare assembly of talent, with no busts, that has changed the trajectory of the program and brought a sense of permanence to Michigan baskethall.

all the most experienced at their
position. This is their show.
"Last year, I thought it was Trey
and Tim's team," McGary said. "So
I kind of sat back and learned from
them. This year, I think Ihave
more of a leadership role and am
going to take charge."
Look anywhere in college
basketball, and you won't find
something like this in years - this
being a group of freshmen of vary-
ing pedigrees all finding success.
There was no unheralded recruit
in the Fab Five. And no pointing
and'hollering about John Calipari's
Kentucky teams - that's predict-
able. Land five-star recruits like
you're picking apples at the grocery
store, and you can expect to have
that type of success.
There were a couple big names
in Michigan coach John Beilein's
2012 class by spring of two seasons
ago, but he wanted more. There
were a couple of potential roster
holes to fill.
Michigan looked at a point
guard destined for Appalachian
State just a few months before he
was scheduled to arrive in Boone,
N.C. and turned him into a col-
lege basketball folk hero. It was
the quickest evaluation of a player

Beilein can remember. That guy,
Albrecht, went on to score 17 points
in the National Championship.
John Beilein would watch high-
lights of Albrecht's prep-school
tapes on flights in the middle of the
2012 Big Ten season and realized
that this guy could help Michigan.
There's LeVert, who would be at
Ohio University if Illinois hadn't
lost grip of its season in 2012 and
lost nine of its last 10 games. Bruce
Weber was fired, former Bobcat
coach John Groce was hired as the
new boss, and LeVert decommitted
from Ohio.
Asked about LeVert's abilities
before the season last year, Beilein
bursted into a bona fide giggle. He
was slated to redshirt the 2012-
13 season, but the bird needed to
be let out of his cage. Same way
this year, with LeVert slotted for
a bench role until Beilein real-
ized that the guard needed to be
on the floor as much as possible.
He's rewarded coach by leading
the team in scoring, pouring in 24
points on 6-for-7 shots from behind
the arc in Tuesday's win over
South Carolina State.
The core recruits lived up to
their expectations. Robinson was
the No.11 recruit in the country

and played like it. He was the most
consistent freshman last year, and
he was predicted to be top-15 draft
pick if he entered the draft.
McGary stumbled his way
through the early going of last sea-
son, showing high energy, yelling a
lot, but not adding a lot to the stat
sheet. That changed as he trans-
formed himself into a prized com-
modity in six NCAA Tournament
games. Potential was realized and
he was pegged as a top-20 draft
selection.
The Wolverines couldn't ask for
more with Stauskas. The native
Canadian has proved himself as an
elite shooter with a strong game
near the rim to boot. I'd venture
he's the best in the country on an
uncontested 3-pointer.
There's also not a disappoint-
ing one in the bunch - a rarity for
the crapshoot nature of projecting
high-schoolers into successful col-
lege basketball players.
Each not only earned playing
time as a freshman, but impor-
tant minutes. Each had marquee
moments that cemented their place
in the program
"It's atypical to see freshmen not
only earn the minutes that they've
earned, but to have the type of

success that they've been able to
earn as well," said assistant coach
Bacari Alexander. "For that, you
get excited about the future."
Just like the Fab Five, this group
is just as tight.
The summer they came to Ann
Arbor, McGary, Robinson and
Albrecht were already friends.
LeVert and Stauskas blended in
seamlessly. Albrecht said that
the chemistry between them was
palpable before they played their
first game. That they all earned
important game experience only
compounded their bond.
Most likely, Robinson and
McGary are gone at the end of the
year. That'll be the end of the Fresh
Five. Three will remain, but these
five will always be a unit. More and
more, it's looking like LeVert, and
possibly Stauskas will join them a
few years later.
What the players can do is well
known. There's no guessing on
their potential. Their legacy is
there to be formed, and Michigan
fans would be wise to lean forward
and pay close attention.

story by Daniel Wasserman, Daily Sports Editor

For all of his life, Glenn Robinson III listened.
He listened. And he thought.

ogwhile he listened, while he
-~thought, others spoke. Even
in his house, he was the qui-
etest one there, "boring," even,
according to his mom.
For his entire life, he's listened
to people tell him he should talk
more. Especially on the court.
Not even the massive Cowboys
Stadium video board - the one
that read: Kansas 70, Michigan 60
with 3:47 to play - could illustrate
the Wolverines' doomed fate like
the faces inside the team's huddle.
"A lot of people were looking
down, and a lot of people didn't
think that we would be able to do
it on our team - even the coach-
ing staff," Robinson remembers. "I
saw it."
So in what was the biggestgame
of his life, he listened to the ban-
ter of his teammates - "people
were talking about plays or this or
that or what we should do" - and
then, finally, he listened to some-
thing else. A voice in his head. An
impulse.
And for the first time as a mem-
ber of the Michigan basketball
team, it was time for his team-
mates to listen to the thinker.
"Shut up."
He rose to his feet, silenc-
ing Trey and Tim, Josh Bartel-
stein and Corey Person. His AAU
coach, his most-trusted mentor,
had always told him that some-
times people misconstrue talkers
with leaders; that "even if garbage
came out (your) mouth," your
teammates would listen. Listen,
because you're the listener.
So that's how Robinson recalls
beginning: "'Listen, let's focus on
defense, and let's get the job done.
"'We can win this game. I don't

know if you're all ready to go home,
but I'm not. Let's go. Let's step this
up, let's get a couple steals and get
right back in it.' "
Michigan did, of course, and
now Robinson has a ring and a new
title, captain, to show for it. But to
understand how he got there, how
he got here, you must understand
the things the listener has heard.
You're not big enough.
The son of two-time NBA All-
Star Glenn Robinson Jr. was born
prematurely - so underdevel-
oped that he fit comfortably in his
father's palm. But before he could
be held, he was placed into an incu-
bator that, for days, housed two
things: baby Glenn and an equally
miniature Purdue basketball.
But for all of his athletic prow-
ess now, he admits that surpris-
ingly, he couldn't dunk until his
sophomore year of high school -
but not for alack of effort.
As a freshman in high school, he
bought shoes from a magazine that
promised to increase his vertical
and wouldn't take them off.
"I don't know what my obses-
sion with dunking was," he says,
unable to hold back his laughter.
"I used to sleep in the shoes, sleep
with ankle weights on, just so I
could dunk."
Four years later, his 360
dunk at Minnesota was No. 1 on
SportsCenter's top-10 plays. Rob-
inson isn't satisfied, giving it a '5'
on a 10-point scale - nothing com-
pared to the dunk over his Jeep
that he has been working on.
But at age 15, with his dad living
hundreds of miles away in Atlanta,

Robinson's stature hardly resem-
bled 'Big Dog.' Without a day-to-
day father figure, the two biggest
basketball mentors entered his life
not long after the completion of his
freshman season on the Lake Cen-
tral High (Ind.) JV team.
The first was Lake Central var-
sity coach Dave Milausnic, who
realized that Robinson would
likely be his best player the next
season. Milausnic saw raw talent,
so he prompted Robinson to come
into school with him at 5:30 a.m.
to shoot. When Robinson needed a
ride, Milausnic was there.
"There were times when he
would be sitting out in the truck
in my driveway, and I was still in
bed - I didn't want to get up," Rob-
inson said. "I thank him for that."
As summer approached, Robin-
son - playing on a younger team
in one the Midwest's best AAU
programs, SYF Players - caught
the eye of famed coach Wayne
Brumm. Brumm, the under-17
coach, has turned the organization
into an Indiana basketball factory
that has pumped out, among oth-
ers, Michigan's Mitch McGary,
Spike Albrecht and Max Bielfeldt,
Michigan State's Branden Daw-
son and Travis Trice, and recent
NBA Draft picks Robbie Hummel,
E'Twaun Moore and Luke Haran-
gody.
"He knew he maybe wanted to
be along the lines of his dad, but
I don't think he really knew how
to get there," Brumm said of his
earliest memories of Robinson. "I
mean, don't get me wrong, he has
good genes obviously, but he was
lanky, skinny and soft, which is a
bad combination."
The first thing that Brumm told

Robinson and his mother was to
call trainer Andrew Wallen. For
Brumm, it was as much of a test as
it was the first step to getting Rob-
inson in shape.
In his first visit to Wallen, Rob-
inson weighed in at 167 pounds. In
six weeks, his vertical increased
six inches. Wallen would give Rob-
inson weekly weight goals - he
still weighs in at every session.
By his junior year, Robinson
was up to 184 pounds. A year later,

he reached 210.
"I've never trained anyone that
would out-work him," Wallen said.
When Robinson committed to
Michigan before his junior year,
he was a three star. By the end of
his senior year, he was a consensus
five star and Rivals.com's No. 11
player.
"Once kids like Glenn become a
star, people think theyve always
been a star, and that's not the
case," Brumm said. "I don't think
