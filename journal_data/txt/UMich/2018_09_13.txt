The 
University 
Research 
Corridor — a partnership of 
the University of Michigan, 
Michigan 
State 
University 
and Wayne State University 
— released its 11th economic 
impact 
report 
last 
week. 
The 
report 
highlights 
the 
universities’ contributions to the 
state economy, which totaled 
$18.7 billion in 2017.
This is a significant increase 
from 2015, when the URC 
added $16.5 billion to the state 
economy. 
Britany 
Affolter-
Caine, executive director of the 
URC, attributes this increase 
to federal funding and larger 

student populations.
“It is being successful — 
the three universities — and 
continuing 
to 
grow 
their 
operations in terms of research 
and education,” Affolter-Caine 
said. “They’ve grown enrollment 
over the last several years. 
They’ve been more successful in 
capturing federal grants to fund 
their research. … Continuing 
growth in those areas is why 
we can say we’ve had a bigger 
impact.”
In addition, the URC added 
78,845 jobs in 2017.
“I think it’s really important 
to think about the impact that’s 
non-monetary — the impact on 
individuals,” 
Affolter-Caine 
said. “There are many impacts 

Lisa D. Cook, an associate 
professor of economics and 
international 
relations 
at 
Michigan State University, 
lead a lecture Wednesday 
at 
U-M 
that 
discussed 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
U.S. 
sanctions 
against 
Russia 
and 
explored 
U.S.-Russian 
relations from an economic 
standpoint. The event was 
organized by the University 
of 
Michigan 
Center 
for 
Russian, East European, and 
Eurasian Studies amid a swirl 
of news headlines around the 
country’s interference in U.S. 
elections.
CREES Director Geneviève 
Zubrzycki 
introduced 
the 
talk, which was one of over 10 
events the center has planned 
for fall semester, all with an 
overarching theme of current 
global relations.
“This year we prepared a 
program that mixes lectures 
that 
engage 
with 
current 
affairs,” 
Zubrzycki 
said. 
“We strive to always bring 
discussions of very recent 
issues by specialists.”
Cook began her lecture 
educating 
the 
audience 
about the Russian economy, 
examining the gradual fall in 
gross domestic product per 
capita and rising inflation, 
with emphasis on the more 
recent 20 percent fall of 
the 
ruble 
in 
relation 
to 

the U.S. dollar in the past 
year. Cook also discussed 
the 
disadvantages 
of 
the 
Russian economic structure, 
outlining its dependence on 
oil 
as 
its 
main 
export, 
capital flight and corruption.
After providing information 
on 
Russia’s 
previous 
and 
current economic troubles, 
Cook detailed the history of 
U.S. economic action against 

Russia. 
She 
brought 
to 
attention the notable March 
2014 sanctions in response to 
Russia’s annexation of Crimea, 
December 2016 sanctions in 
response 
to 
Russian 
interference in U.S elections 
and August 2018 sanctions in 
response to the poisoning of 
ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal 
and 
his 
daughter 
Yulia. 
These sanctions freeze assets 

and 
prohibit 
transactions 
with 
specific 
individuals, 
which in many cases are 
Putin’s associates, Russian 
government 
officials 
and 
Russian 
oligarchs. 
Cook 
explained the effectiveness 
of sanctions remains relative 
but cited a 1.5 percent decline 
of real GDP in Russia, solely 
from 
U.S. 
and 
European 

LSA senior Haley Richardson 
did 
not 
consider 
herself 
a 
programmer before receiving an 
email about a new computer science 
class. But the introductory-level 
course released at the University of 
Michigan this semester, EECS 198: 
Discover Computer Science, moved 
her to see new opportunities 
coming her way.
“I 
was 
immediately 
really 
interested for multiple reasons, 
one (being) that I have zero 
experience with computer science 
— I know absolutely nothing about 
it, and that’s one of the things 
that I’ve always been very aware 
of,” Richardson said. 
The one-credit course is led by 
EECS Professor Rada Mihalcea 
and 
doctoral 
student 
Laura 
Wendlandt. It focuses on exposing 
all students – particularly freshmen 
women – who have not had formal 
programming 
experience 
to 
the world of computer science. 
Throughout the semester, students 
will have the opportunity to 
learn essential computer science 
concepts, begin to write code, visit 
local computer science companies

Hanna-Attisha weaves identity as an Iraqi immigrant and pediatrician, looks to recovery

Renowned 
pediatrician 
Mona 
Hanna-Attisha 
spoke 
Wednesday 
to 
a 
sold-out 
Rackham Auditorium about her 
first-hand account of exposing 
the dangerous levels of lead in 

Flint. This is the second part 
of the two-day event called 
Environmental Justice Focus: 
Flint Water Crisis, co-sponsored 
by the School for Environment 
and Sustainability and Literati 
Bookstore.
Hanna-Attisha’s 
book, 
titled “What the Eyes Don’t 
See,” 
reviews 
her 
journey 

acting as a whistleblower in 
the Flint water crisis and 
how her identity as an Arab-
American shaped her career as 
a pediatrician.
Hanna-Attisha, a University 
alum, began explaining her 
book title has two meanings: on 
a literal level, it represents how 
the effects of lead poisoning 

aren’t visible or immediately 
apparent inpatients and water; 
figuratively, it represents how 
Hanna-Attisha had her own 
eyes closed to the Flint water 
crisis.
“It is about people, it is about 
places and it is about problems 
that we choose not to see,”

The Ann Arbor Transportation 
Commission 
met 
Wednesday 
evening to discuss the presence 
of Bird scooters in the city, 
among other agenda items. Ann 
Arbor residents and University of 
Michigan students have used the 
motorized scooters around the city 
since their deployment Friday. The 
commission weighed allowing the 
scooters on city streets in the near 
future. 
Bird dropped the scooters in 
Ann Arbor without notice to the 
city, a practice that the company 
has become known for at many 
of its locations all over the United 
States. City officials were caught 
off guard and forced to deal with 
the presence of the scooters the 
following day.
The 
commission 
meeting 
followed a response from the city 
publicly warning residents that 
use of the scooters could merit 
a ticket. However, the response 
of the commission was more 
measured 
and 
Commissioner 
Linda Diane Feldt characterized 
the city’s response as “short and 
threatening.”

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

On Wednesday evening, 
Interfraternity Council 
President Sam Finn, a Public 
Policy senior, released a 
statement to The Daily 
proclaiming a number 
of fraternity chapters — 
including Theta Chi, Alpha 
Sigma Phi, and Psi Upsilon 
— have decided to disaffiliate 
from IFC after a July change 
in city zoning codes. However, 

Finn noted the council 
will continue working to 
strengthen the recruitment, 
education and harm reduction 
programs of its remaining 
member organizations over 
the course of the year.
The zoning codes, approved 
during the July 16 council 
session, would require new 
fraternities and sororities to 
maintain affiliation with the 
University of Michigan or 
another collegiate institution 
to be permitted or allowed 
expansion within the city. If 

the fraternity or sorority loses 
its University affiliation in 
the future, it can apply for a 
two-year special exception to 
prevent loss of its house.
“While a large number of 
chapters initially indicated 
an intent to disaffiliate, the 
IFC Executive Board worked 
diligently with student 
leaders and inter/national 
organization representatives 
to re-affirm member 
organization’s commitment 
to the IFC, the University 
of Michigan, and student 

wellness,” the statement read. 
“Consequently, only a handful 
of chapters have elected to 
disaffiliate from the IFC.”
Though the disaffiliated 
chapters will maintain 
their rights to operate 
autonomously, they will be 
denied traditional programs 
offered by IFC and the 
University such as anti-hazing 
and social responsibility task 
forces.

Harvard University
@Harvard

Harvard and @UMich have 
launched two partnerships 
aimed to encourage economic 
opportunity in Detroit and to 
fight opioid additction

that affect the rank-and-file 
Michigander.”
In the short term, students 

at URC universities contribute 
directly to the state and local 
economies by buying goods and 
services and boosting business. 
In the long-term, their presence 
is more important, according 
to 
Affolter-Caine. 
Students 
who attend these universities 

frequently find career paths in the 
state, often working on projects 
and jobs that can improve the 
lives of Michiganders.
Affolter-Caine also attributes 
the success to innovative services 
and projects developed by the 
universities 
which 
directly 
impact the state. She cites 
the Perinatology Research 
Branch, part of the Wayne 
State School of Medicine, 
as an excellent example of 
a university project that 
 
helped 
the 
general 
 
public. 
The 
PRB 
has 
discovered a non-invasive 
treatment for women at risk 
for pre-term labor, which 
is now part of standard 
practice in hospitals across 
Michigan.
Affolter-Caine also cited 
Mcity, a mock city in Ann 
Arbor used to test driverless 
cars, as another excellent 
example.
“There are just not that 
many really unique facilities 
like Mcity,” Affolter-Caine 
said. “And it is bringing 
businesses from all over the 
world to Ann Arbor. It gives 
students an opportunity to 
conduct research and get 
that experience.”
Engineering 
professor 
Glen 
Daigger, 
who 
has 
been acquainted with the 
URC for three years and 
participated 
in 
several 

cross-university collaborations, 
said in addition to the raw 
economic 
contributions, 
the 
URC has helped significantly in 
facilitating further cooperation 
between the universities.
He noted that the three 
universities have been working 
together 
to 
improve 
the 
networking 
between 
state 
researchers and practitioners in 
and out of Michigan. 
Like Affolter-Caine, Daigger 
believes that innovation is central 
to the success and impact of the 
URC. He also credits researchers 
and academics for their work.
“If you aren’t doing new 
things and improving and so 
forth, 
you’re 
actually 
going 
down,” Daigger said. “In terms 
of economic contribution, the 
dollars flowing in for research 
are certainly a contribution, 
but it’s the ideas and the people 
and the enthusiasm and so forth 
that are the biggest contribution 
to 
continue 
the 
economic 
development here in Michigan.”
Daigger 
also 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
students 
to the research and economic 
contributions from all three 
universities.
“Every engine needs fuel. The 
research engine needs money. 
One of the other fuels is the 
students,” Daigger said. “They’re 
the hands and the minds and the 
curiosity that really drive much 
of this research.”

Union sanctions.
“What 
Russia 
might 
be 
experiencing 
if 
these 
sanctions are effective is the 
undermining 
of 
economic 
growth,” she said.
Cook also noted varying 
levels 
of 
unrest 
within 
Russian 
society 
as 
living 
standards remain stagnant or 
even decline. She referenced 
the recent protests against 
the Russian government in 
response to a proposal to 
raise retirement age from 60 
to 65 for men and 55 to 60 for 
women. 
“My sense is that what was 
underground before, in terms 
of economic discontent, is 

just bubbling to the surface. 
Pension reform is something 
that has not been a partisan 
issue. There were all kinds of 
people protesting on Sunday,” 
Cook said. “There has been a 
rupture in the social compact 
that is leading to the agitation 
of people and the breaking of 
this agreement not to protest 
or argue for more democracy.”
Community High School 
student Ben Clingenpeel, an 
Ann Arbor resident, said he 
attended the lecture to learn 
more about the current state 
of relations between the U.S 
and Russia.
“This is a topic I’ve been 
gaining interest in, as I think 
a lot of people in this country 
have,” he said. “I’m trying to 
stay informed.”

“My sense of the commission 
is that we want to be welcoming 
of devices that expand the 
choices that people have for 
transportation,” Feldt said.
The committee heard from 
Raymond Hess, the Ann Arbor 
transportation manager, who 
noted 
existing 
legislation 
will 
soon 
regulate 
electric 
skateboards and allow their use 
in city streets. The scooters are 
similar devices, and Hess stated 
the city will likely regulate them 
in the same way.
However, this legislation was 
written before the Bird scooters 
appeared in Ann Arbor, so it 
is possible the city will adjust 
its 
regulatory 
agenda 
after 
considering the visible impact of 
the devices.
Commissioner Scott Trudeau 
expressed interest in imposing 
a tax on the scooters, noting 
the city of Portland, Ore., 
is projected to collect more 
than $1 million this year on a 
similar tax. Trudeau also stated 
imposing a limit on the total 
number of scooters in the city 
could be a reliable way to prevent 
the influx of devices from 
overwhelming the city. He also 
noted the possibility of placing 
speed limiters in the scooters 
corresponding to local speed 
limits.
He further expressed a desire 
to ensure the scooters were 
available for use to all parts of 
the city, not just the wealthiest 
corners.
Ann Arbor resident Victoria 
Green was the only resident to 
speak about the scooters during 
the public comment portion 
of the meeting. She expressed 
concern over the city’s response 
but holds reservations about the 
possible impact of the scooters’ 
presence.
“I was surprised when the 
city’s response to the wide-scale 
implementation of Bird scooters 
was an outright prohibition,” 
Green said. “I think Ann Arbor 

is best for most people when we 
have a variety of transportation 
options. I do share concerns that 
I’ve heard among many of my 
friends in the University about 
the sudden appearance of large 
numbers and issues especially 
around using public space to 
store them.”
Steve 
Dolan, 
director 
of 
University 
Transportation 
Services, expressed frustration 
with the company for dropping 
the fleet of scooters without 
notice. He noted several similar 
companies had reached out to 
the city requesting to expand 
their business to Ann Arbor, 
receiving 
responses 
stating 
the city is supportive of such 
transportation companies but 
needed to prepare infrastructure 
or legislation first. Bird ignored 
this request. Hess stated other 
companies attempting to “play 
by the rules” have now contacted 
the city upset about Bird’s 
presence in Ann Arbor.
Trudeau noted the city is 
already 
attempting 
to 
find 
solutions to similar problems 
posed 
by 
other 
forms 
of 
transportation and stated these 
efforts could be easily expanded 
to include Bird scooters.
“I think a lot of the problems 
that these things potentially 
generate are problems we’re 
already trying to solve,” Trudeau 
said.
Commissioner Bradley Parson 
echoed this sentiment and said 
the city should consider how the 
scooters fit into existing laws 
— they are technically neither 
vehicles nor motorized — before 
imposing new regulations.
“This is a gray area and I 
encourage the city staff response 
to allow things to develop instead 
of react quickly,” Parsons said.
At the close of the discussion, 
Feldt asked the members to 
consider what action to take 
with respect to the scooters. 
Feldt proposed the commission 
create a charter for a task force 
or advisory committee to aid the 
city in dealing with the scooters 
and the commission resolved to 
do so.

FRE E SWING DANCING

Swing Ann Arbor offers free swing dancing classes to kick off the semester behind Hatcher Wednesday night. 
RUCHITA IYER/Daily

Hanna-Attisha said. “For about 
a year and a half I was also very 
blind to what was happening in 
Flint. I was telling my patients 
that everything was okay. I was 
drinking the Kool-Aid — that 
the water was fine and that it 
was fine for the kids to drink. 
So it is about all of us being 
blind to the injustices that are 
happening all around us.”
Hanna-Attisha 
also 
underscored 
her 
identity 
as 
a 
first-generation 
Iraqi-
immigrant. Her parents escaped 
Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s 
fascist regime and immigrated 
to the United States for their 
children to have a chance at 
living out the American dream, 
and Hanna-Attisha said as a 
result, she was acutely aware 
of her privilege growing up in 
the United States. As a child, 
her 
parents 
never 
shielded 
her from what was going on in 
Iraq, often sharing the current 
events of the war. That included 
the story of the small northern 
Iraqi town of Halabja, which 
suffered the largest chemical 
attack in history when Saddam 
Hussein poisoned over 5,000 
people.
“I remember seeing, very 
vividly, a picture of a beautiful 
baby in a pink blanket lifeless 
on the street nestled by her 

father who was also lifeless,” 
Hanna-Attisha said. “And that 
was the milieu of my childhood. 
Knowing what people in power 
could do to whole populations.”
After 
Hanna-Attisha 
held 
the 
initial 
press 
conference 
revealing 
her 
research 
of 
the 
increased 
lead levels in the Flint water, 
she was denounced by the 
state 
government. 
While 
she expected some of the 
hurdles she had to face, she 
remembers how nothing could 
have prepared her for the 
critics’ denial of her research. 
Almost every branch of the 
state government said she was 
unnecessarily 
“causing 
near 
hysteria.” 
They 
called 
her 
an “unfortunate researcher” 
who was “splicing and dicing 
numbers.” She recalls the small 
doubt she felt in herself and in 
her research for a split second, 
until she remembered why she 
began this investigation in the 
first place.
“This is everything about the 
kids,” Hanna-Attisha said. “The 
children are my constituency … 
and as a pediatrician, I literally 
have taken an oath to protect 
these kids. These kids are no 
different than my children. 
One of the reasons I went 
into pediatrics is because it is 
advocacy work. It is our job to 
stand up, to speak up for kids.”
However, she acknowledged 
the work she did would not 

be possible without the large 
community 
that 
supported 
her. She noted it was “a village 
of folks who came together 
to fight,” made up of moms, 
activists, pastors, journalists 
and citizen scientists in a 
mission to figure this out.
“The other heroes in this 
book are our elected officials,” 
Hanna-Attisha said. “So state 
Sen. 
Ananich, 
Congressman 
Kildee, 
Sen. 
Stabenow 
and 
Peters, they had my back at 
every 
level 
of 
government. 
When, you know, the state was 
dismissing me, the EPA was also 
dismissing me, Congressman 
Kildee was fighting the EPA, 
(saying,) ‘No, she’s right, her 
data is right.’”
When asked about the real 
culprit of the Flint water crisis, 
she named “ideologies” as the 
true villains.
“This 
was 
driven 
by 
austerity, this was driven by 
environmental 
injustice 
and 
racism 
and 
discrimination,” 
Hanna-Attisha said. “It was 
driven by a lack of democracy. 
A disrespect for science. It was 
these ideologies that were the 
real villains in the story.”
But 
Hanna-Attisha 
keeps 
writing 
“prescriptions 
for 
hope,” not only for her patients, 
but also for young people 
nationwide. 
Second-year 
Medical student Erica Odukoya 
said Hanna-Attisha should be 
applauded for her bold decision 

to stay true to her values.
“What I’m really inspired 
by is how she was able to take 
her commitment to her patients 
as being enough of an impetus 
to keep moving forward and 
disrupt the status quo despite 
the costs,” Odukoya said.
Hanna-Attisha noted Flint 
is currently creating several 
programs to promote child-
development, especially when 
it comes to increasing literacy. 
With 
Hanna-Attisha’s 
new 
program called Flint Kids Read, 
every child in Flint between 
the ages of 0 and 5 gets a book 
mailed to their house every 
month.
Hanna-Attisha’s 
former 
mentor and SEAS professor 
emeritus Paul Webb beamed 
with pride upon greeting her 
at an informal Q&A at the 
School of Environment and 
Sustainability, also attended by 
members of campus television 
station WOLV-TV. 
“She may think she’s in the 
5-foot area, but I’ve always 
looked up to her even as she was 
an undergraduate,” Webb said.
Hanna-Attisha 
concluded 
the book talk with one more 
prescription for hope regarding 
Flint.
“Flint is not going to be 
defined by this crisis, but 
rather, 
by 
our 
recovery,” 
Hanna-Attisha said.

and more.
Mihalcea 
and 
Wendlandt 
developed the course as a way 
to expand the ideas of the CS 
KickStart 
program, 
which 
encourages women to enroll and 
continue 
in 
computer 
science 
courses at the University. They 
wanted to expand the goals of the 
program to more students.
“CS KickStart was successful in 
introducing women to computer 
science, so we wanted to think 
about ways that we could scale 
that sort of initiative and reach a 
larger audience,” Wendlandt said. 
“We wanted to take some of the 
CS KickStart material and other 
material and turn it into a class 
format to make it a little more 
accessible to more people and a 
broader set of people.”
Richardson 
described 
how 
she 
appreciated 
being 
in 
an 
environment 
designed 
for 
women, especially given the race 
and gender disparities in computer 
science 
and 
STEM 
at 
large. 
University records published in Fall 
2015, for example, show the School 
of Engineering was 25 percent 
female and 2 percent Black— out of 
9,428 students enrolled at the time, 
only 64 were female Black students.
“It’s geared entirely towards 
freshman women (but) anyone 
can take it, obviously — I’m not a 
freshman,” Richardson said. “But 
I like the idea of having a class 
that is geared towards people who 

are sort of underrepresented and 
inexperienced in this field and 
giving them the chance to dip their 
feet it.”
Mihalcea also pointed out the 
lack of women in computer science 
field and expressed the EECS 
Department’s desire to continue 
programs working to combat the 
issue.
“The number of women in 
computer science is not as high as 
the number of men so there is an 
imbalance there,” Mihalcea said, 
“So this is sort of the motivation 
behind initiatives like CS KickStart, 
Girls in Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Science and other 
initiatives 
around 
trying 
to 
encourage women both in terms of 
recruiting and retaining.”
Though 
the 
course 
was 
designed for incoming freshmen 
women, Mihalcea and Wendlandt 
emphasized anyone is welcome to 
join.
“We received a lot of support,” 
Wendlandt said, “The department 
is very supportive of initiatives to 
recruit a lot of people to computer 
science. We will add that the class 
is open to everyone, not just to 
incoming freshman women. It’s 
open to anyone that would like to 
take it.”
Richardson said she preferred 
EECS 198 to other introductory 
EECS courses because of its 
inclusive and collaborative class 
climate.
“Me going into an EECS 183 
class was sort of something I never 
imagined myself doing because it’s 
really intimidating,” Richardson 

said. “The environment is very 
different — you’re going to be around 
very different people and the pace 
and the sort of rigor of the course is 
so intense. This seemed like a really 
good way for me to get to know 
something that I was interested in 
and kind of excluded myself from 
before, and even felt excluded from 
just being a woman who studies 
other STEM and humanities.”
LSA freshman Monica Iyer 
is 
another 
student 
in 
EECS 
198 who also had little prior 
programming 
experience 
but 
wanted to explore the realm of 
computer science. Iyer has enjoyed 
the course so far and echoed 
Richardson’s 
sentiment 
about 
its engaging and collaborative 
environment.
“It’s all girls so far, and a lot 
of them also haven’t really tried 
computer science — or at least 
people I’ve talked to,” Iyer said. 
“Everyone seemed really excited 
and willing to help. We did a little 
activity at the end of the first class 
and everyone was helping each 
other out and having fun with it, so 
it was really exciting.”
Iyer said she also appreciated 
having the opportunity to delve 
deeper 
into 
computer 
science 
without 
having 
to 
completely 
rearrange her schedule.
“I got a taste of what computer 
science is like and the possible 
careers it could lead to so I wanted 
to continue learning more, but I 
didn’t want to completely rearrange 
my schedule so the mini course was 
just perfect,” she said. 
Both 
Richardson 
and 
Iyer 

praised Mihalcea and Wendlant for 
their enthusiastic instruction and 
desire to engage students in the 
material.
“The 
instructor 
is 
amazing 
from what I’ve experienced so 
far,” Richardson said. “She’s very 
excited just to learn and share this 
knowledge with us and get everyone 
really 
interested 
in 
computer 
science so it was a very constructive 
and exciting environment and I 
think everyone felt at ease leaving 
the classroom that first day.”
Though the class has only just 
begun, Richardson has already 
expressed an interest in learning 
even more about computer science 
in the future.
“Even after just one lecture, and 
even the act of enrolling in (EECS 
198), has made me think about this 
whole other realm of computer 
science that I had never considered 
before.” Richardson said. “Just all 
of the ways it is applicable to life 
in general no matter what you’re 
studying. I’m already looking at 
what EECS course I can take next 
semester.”
Mihalcea hopes students will 
take the skills they learned in EECS 
198 and continue to apply it in 
whatever they decide to pursue.
“If they think of computer science 
as an option for either right now or 
down the road— or (if they realize) 
other areas … involve computer 
science, so you could do computer 
science 
even 
if 
you’re 
doing 
chemistry or chemical engineering 
fields — looking at computer science 
as a field that might as well be for 
them, I think that would be a win.”

“

Never have I ever had sex 
with a member,” I said 
looking around the room 
at my fellow volunteers and the 
young members of Kibbutz Baram. 
I quickly noticed none of the 
members took a drink. “How is it 
possible that none of you have had 
sex with a member?”
“Have 
sex 
with 
another 
member? I would never!”
“What? Why not!?”
“After growing up and spending 
all day with other members I view 
them as my brothers and sisters… 
having sex with them would just 
be gross.”
Throughout my summer living 
in Baram, a socialist town in the 
northern part of Israel, I came to 
find this was a common mindset 
that is inspired by a commitment to 
a collective ideology. The kibbutz 
movement, which started in the 
early 20th century, originally 
sought to merge socialism and 
Zionism through the creation 
of agricultural and industrial 
cooperative towns in Israel. At 
Baram, I quickly noticed the 
collective mentality displayed in 
games such as “Never Have I Ever” 
is diminishing for the Kibbutz’s 
youngest generation, iGen. In 
iGen, Baram is a case study into 
how social media causes the two 
opposing worlds of individualism 
and socialism to collide.
Baram was founded in 1949 
by 60 former members of the 
Hashomer Hatzair, a socialist-
Zionist youth movement. The 
founders arrived in the hilly forest 
that would later become Baram 
with nothing more than a bold 
vision of society. In the beginning, 
the “members” of Baram took 
the socialist critique of private 
property to the extreme; members 
shared everything from underwear 
to daily outfits.
A lot has changed for Israel in 
the past 69 years, as has Baram, 
but the biggest change appears to 
be looming in a surprising place 
— social media. In the 1980s, 
Israel went through a massive 
economic crisis that resulted in 
the creation of a new currency 
and a shift toward a free market 
economic model. The collapse of 
the economy meant nearly every 
kibbutz had to privatize, code for 
turning into regular towns where 
everyone has different incomes and 
private property. As of a 2010 study 
conducted by Haifa University, 
only 65 of the 256 kibbutzim have 
yet to privatize and Baram is one of 
the few that remains dedicated to 
its communal roots. In 1997, Baram 
was proudly the very last kibbutz 
to close their “children’s home,” a 
house in which all children of the 
kibbutz would sleep in at night 

because 
kibbutzniks 
(people 
who live in a kibbutz) believed 
even children could be raised 
communally.
During my time living and 
working in Baram I tried to learn 
as much as I could about Baram 
and the rich history of the kibbutz 
movement. I assumed the ending 
of the children’s home created a 
gigantic generational divide —I 
thought all children born after 
1997 would be vastly different 
from the other kibbutzniks but 
I quickly learned the story was 
more complicated. I spoke with 
a member who was one of the 
first children raised after the 
termination of the children’s home, 
who for confidentiality purposes 

will go by Isabel; she told me the 
termination of the home didn’t 
change the kibbutz all that much. 
She stated she and her classmates 
at the kibbutz still spent so much 
time together that where they slept 
didn’t really make a difference – 
they still went to school together, 
they still ate in the dining hall with 
all the other members and they still 
played together at the pool after 
school. To me, Isabel’s narrative 
seemed to demonstrate how the 
millennials in Baram had a strong 
sense of camaraderie with each 
other.
Isabel, 
a 
millennial, 
did 
however think there was a large 
generational 
divide 
between 
her and the teens. From Isabel’s 
perspective, the current children of 
Baram have a much stronger sense 
of individualism than any previous 
generation, and she believes social 
media is changing the way the 
children of the kibbutz think about 
themselves and their community. 
Isabel’s argument is hard to deny. 
Social media makes teenagers 
hyper-aware of their personal 
image and the way other people 
perceive them. Through likes, 
views and followers Instagram 
quantifies a previously invisible 
social 
hierarchy 
and 
trains 
teenagers to think of themselves 
as a brand defined by their image. 
Snapchat trains teens to constantly 
take photos themselves and thus 
trains them to think about how 
they look in comparison to others. 

Why wouldn’t these apps change 
the way that teenage kibbutzniks 
view 
themselves 
and 
their 
community?
This generational divide is 
widely discussed and studied in the 
American psychology community. 
Jean Twenge, a University of 
Michigan alum and professor of 
psychology at San Diego State 
University, says millennials and 
the younger generation, iGens, 
are separated by the age of social 
media and the internet; iGens 
grow up with smartphones and 
have 
an 
Instagram 
accounts 
before they start high school, 
while millennials remember a time 
before the smartphone. This divide 
places current college students 
directly on the border between 
the two generations, leaving many 
people in their early 20s, like 
myself and Isabel, feeling more like 
a millennial. Twenge finds iGens 
spend much more time isolated 
and alone in their rooms using 
their social media and thinking 
about their image — a narrative 
that fits in perfectly with Isabel’s 
perception of iGen kibbutzniks in 
Baram.
Baram’s edited socialist society 
will only continue to function 
if members of the community 
are dedicated to the challenge 
of thinking from the level of the 
collective, 
not 
the 
individual. 
Isabel and many other members 
whom I spoke to are very worried 
about the future of Baram. Despite 
the economic success of Baram, 
over the past few years there has 
been conversation and even a vote 
about privatization, the death of 
communal living.
From my brief time there, I 
felt that the iGens did not have 
the same communal cognition 
as the other generations. Rather, 
I noticed anecdotal evidence for 
their differing identity — like the 
fact that there were a few iGen 
couples and the iGens tended to 
hangout in smaller groups rather 
than all together. I can sense this 
generational divide on campus, 
with current freshmen religiously 
checking their Snapchats and 
upperclassmen 
devotedly 

hitting “interested” on Facebook 
events. To many members of 
Baram, social media is a form 
of 
capitalist 
propaganda 
that 
trains young people to perceive 
themselves throuwwgh the hyper 
individualistic 
and 
isolating 
lenses of apps like Instagram and 
Snapchat; the truth of these claims, 
however, just like the future of 
Baram, remains to be seen.

Lessons from media
“

Gossip Girl” is a popular 
television show many of 
my friends binge watch 
on Netflix. As a fifth grader, I 
started watching the series live 
and followed the dramatic lives 
of high school aged Manhattan 
Elite, never missing an episode. 
On a lazy summer afternoon, 
after scrolling through Netflix 
with no luck, I decided to 
re-watch the first episode.
The pilot started and it was 
just like the good old days. It was 
as entertaining and dramatic as I 
remembered. I was comfortable 
with the characters and the 
storyline so I didn’t really have 
to pay attention. That is, until a 
scene where a female character 
was sexually assaulted by a 
male character. I was shocked. 
I didn’t remember this scene 
or anything of its nature on the 
show. I continued watching the 
episode, but again there was 
another scene with the same 
male character sexual assaulting 
another female character. This 
time I was alarmed.
I 
was 
disgusted 
and 
could not continue to watch 
the next episode. In anger, 
I began searching online to 
find what others thought after 
re-watching the pilot and found 
many mixed feelings. Some 
people just noticed, brushed it 
off and decided to focus on the 
parts they loved while others 
pinpointed all the reasons the 
show is bad for young women. 
With these different reactions 
in 
mind, 
I 
found 
myself 
wondering if should I continue 
to watch shows that I enjoy 
even if they have messages that 

I do not support?
When I look back at some of 
my favorite shows, movies and 
music, they have underlying 
messages of misogyny through 
the actions of characters or the 
words of the lyrics. I’m aware 
of this and I think the first step 
is noticing the inequalities in 
our society that are portrayed 
in our media. But as a young 
person, I did not notice this when 
watching “Gossip Girl” for the 

first time.

Last 
winter 
in 
my 
developmental 
psychology 
class, my professor shared her 
findings on how adolescents 
learn by observing behaviors 
and attitudes from their media. 
This means, whether I was 
aware of it or not, I was learning 
about 
sexuality, 
gender 
and sexual relationships by 
watching programs like “Gossip 
Girl”. Now, in hindsight, that 
proves extremely problematic.
As young people, we so 
easily learn from our media. 
Thus, 
seeing 
storylines 
of 
sexual 
assault 
unfold 
time 
and time again can teach us, 

particularly in our youth, that 
this is how the world works. In 
the past, I’ve had experiences or 
heard stories from my friends 
about instances that I now 
know may not have been totally 
consensual. But when these 
experiences happened, we felt 
like it was positive because we 
learned from our world and the 
media that if a man was giving 
us attention, it was good.
This doesn’t mean I have to 
stop watching these shows but 
I’m not sure how I am supposed 
to 
enjoy 
them. 
Now, 
I’m 
actively choosing to find media 
with messages that empower 
me 
instead 
of 
reinforcing 
internalized 
misogynistic 
thoughts and actions. I try to 
find media that promotes a 
positive self-image and strong 
female relationships that are 
not always about what women 
think of men. For example, I 
have been watching “Broad 
City” and listening to songs by 
hip-hop artist Lizzo. 
We don’t need media that 
makes us feel inadequate or 
insecure. Explore new types of 
music. Watch shows and movies 
about 
things 
you 
normally 
wouldn’t have in past. Fall in 
love with new characters that 
are different from you. Listen 
to lyrics that make you feel 
good in your body. As adults, by 
understanding that the kind of 
media we consume impacts us, 
we have the agency to choose 
what we consume.

iGen and the future of the kibbutz

50 years since ‘68

alfway 
around 
the 
world, 
American 
warplanes deliver death 
and destruction to a country 
torn apart from years of brutal 
fratricide. Beyond our southern 
border, a despotic regime silences 
its critics with batons and bullets 
alike. With equal amounts flair 
and frustration, women speak 
out against a system they view 
as suffocating and oppressive. 
And on a scale viewed by many as 
unprecedented, America’s youth 
protest Washington’s seeming 
indifference to the preventable 
deaths of their peers.
These 
events 
collectively 
comprise the present— the civil 
war in Syria, violent repression 
in Nicaragua, the second annual 
Women’s March and the March 
for 
Our 
Lives—and 
are 
all 
defining moments and stories of 
2018. But they are also the past, 
just as easily characterizations 
of 1968: the pinnacle of American 
involvement in the Vietnam War, 
the year of student-led protests 
in Mexico City, the Miss America 
feminist protest and the anti-war 
riot in Chicago.
Half a century ago, many of 
the same ideological divisions 
and systemic inequalities that 
continue to plague our world 
came to a boiling point. The 
United States’ military foray into 
Vietnam had reached its peak, and 
the subsequent outrage was, for 
the first time, becoming popular. 
From Prague to Paris, from civil 
rights activists to students and 
workers, it seemed that there 
wasn’t enough “Enough!” to go 
around.
However, 
1968 
wasn’t 
just another chapter in the 
counterculture saga. It was a point 
of realization for movements 
that would go on to empower 
traditionally neglected segments 
of society, but it also saw many 
of these movements lose their 
leaders and face punishment 
for voicing dissent. The year of 
1968 served as a broadcast to 
those less enthusiastic citizens 
that massive, peaceful revolt 
could effect actual progress on 
a variety of issues, but it also 
marked a nadir in communion 
between 
two 
Americas 
that 
seemed further than ever. These 
dynamics appear to remain all 
too true today.
Of course, the idea that 
history repeats itself is nothing 
new. So, what makes those events 
of a half-century ago so unique? 
The answer lies in the youth. 

Those of college (and draft) 
age in 1968 inhabited a world 
still adapting to the pressures 
and influences of television, a 
technology so widespread that 
it fundamentally redefined how 
people saw each other. And 
just as television reshaped how 
citizens saw the wars their tax 
dollars were funding and the 
protests their governments were 
suppressing in 1968, social media 
and widespread internet access 
have overhauled old methods of 
mobilizing constituencies and 
spreading (mis)information in 
today’s political climate.
Similarly, 
just 
as 
young 
Americans 
in 
1968 
felt 
the 
injustice of being shipped off 
to participate in a war they 
did not believe in, all the while 
many were not conferred equal 
treatment at home, the seminal 
2016 presidential election shows 
how younger Americans today 
widely feel that the current 
administration does not reflect 
their best interests. 
If 
the 
parallels 
between 
1968 and 2018 show how well-
positioned younger generations 
are to effect change, then the 
differences between then and 
now highlight how far that change 
has brought us in those 50 years. 
Five decades ago, America was on 
the cusp of achieving its current 
status as a fully democratic 
republic (in terms of which races 
and which citizens were granted 
a place in the electorate) — today, 
we take those universal liberties 
for granted as we exercise them, 
even begrudgingly. Students such 
as ourselves were the first in this 
country to enjoy free speech 
protections that we have the 
privilege to debate over today, 
and many did not even enjoy a 
place at the ballot box. 
So what lessons does our 
past, particularly that which is 
simultaneously so close and yet so 
far, offer us? 1968 shows the youth 
of today just how large a role was 
played by their predecessors in 
reforming the institutions that 
we now consider fundamental, 
but it also offers up a cautionary 
tale to those who dare to question 
their own ability, and with that 
their 
own 
responsibility, 
to 
change the world for the better.
Amid 
the 
backdrop 
of 
furious antiwar protesters who 
nonetheless found inadequate 
support 
in 
the 
public, 
the 
misguided 
presidential 
nomination of pro-war candidate 
Hubert Humphrey in August 1968 

aptly illustrated the downfall of 
such 
disengagement. 
Enabled 
by a system that all but shut out 
the popular opinion of his party, 
Humphrey’s 
nomination 
was 
characterized 
by 
a 
failure 
to “ … realize how deep the 
anger and hatred of the young 
had become,” and ultimately cost 
the Democrats the election that 
year. The “antiwar” victor of the 
contest, Richard Nixon, would go 
on to show the liberal youth who 
stayed home that year the cost of 
their ambivalence by sacrificing 
tens of thousands more American 
souls in Southeast Asia. 
If the social crusades being 
waged today seem relatively 
inconsequential, it is because 
those of the present always 
appear to be. But we must not 
forget being at the forefront of 
public opinion, as young people, 
also places us at the beginning 
of change. The fights for better 
health care, fairer voting laws and 
more universal discrimination 
protections today do not loom 
nearly as large as their previous 
incarnations, but they will go 
down as chapters in a horrific 
history of complacency if they are 
not fought.
Just as we wonder, with 
shame, how our country once 
permitted 
overwhelming 
indifference to the lives of its 
own citizens, allowed states 
to deny suffrage to millions of 
voters and stood by while entire 
demographics 
were 
excluded 
from 
American 
life, 
future 
generations will not look so 
kindly upon a generation that 
does nothing to continue these 
quests for the sake of posterity.
Committing to a future 
of greater equality and fairer 
governance, 
especially 
in 
light of the struggles of a half-
century ago and the activism 
that rose up to meet it, is a 
noble aspiration that must 
be led by those with the most 
to offer. That the window of 
ideas deemed acceptable and 
achievable is in a constant state 
of expansion means that this 
class of leaders will continue to 
be drawn from the incubators 
of youthful spirit, just as it was 
in 1968. Looking back on that

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Thursday, September 13, 2018

Here’s what every varsity head coach is making at Michigan this year

You’ve probably seen articles 
discussing 
the 
compensation 
received 
by 
college 
coaches, 
including those at the University 
of Michigan. Jim Harbaugh’s 
salary is one of the largest in all 
of college football — up there with 
Clemson’s Dabo Swinney and 
Ohio State’s Urban Meyer. As for 
John Beilein, the Michigan men’s 
basketball coach signed a contract 
extension this summer that will 
likely see him finish his career in 
Ann Arbor.
But 
there 
has 
been 
little 
reporting 
about 
the 
smaller 
sports. 
The 
Michigan 
Daily 
hopes to change that. The Daily 
requested contracts for every 
coach employed by the university, 
via the Freedom of Information 
Act. Here’s what we received back:
Jim Harbaugh (football)
• 
Harbaugh is set to make 
$7.5 million in 2018 after receiving 
a 10 percent raise on both his base 
salary of $500,000 and additional 
compensation of $4,500,000. The 
$7.5 million also includes $2 million 
in premium advances.
• 
He is set to receive 
another 10 percent bump in both 
categories at the end of the 2019 
season.
• 
Also 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
2019 
season, 
Harbaugh’s 
performance and compensation 
will be evaluated, possibly leading 
to a greater salary.
• 
Harbaugh’s 
contract 
runs through the 2021 season.
• 
Potential 
bonuses 
include $125,000 for making the 
Big Ten Championship Game, 
$250,000 for winning it, $300,000 
for making the College Football 
Playoff, $500,000 for winning a 
national championship.
• 
Harbaugh has a $4,000 
apparel allowance for personal use 
each calendar year.
• 
If fired without cause, 
Harbaugh will still be paid his 
annual base salary and additional 
compensation. 
Harbaugh 
is 
required to seek another job as soon 
as possible in such a situation.
John 
Beilein 
(men’s 
basketball)
• 
Beilein will be paid $3.8 
million annually through the 2022-
23 season. After that, the contract

• 
The salary is split into 
a $400,000 base, $1.9 million 
additional 
compensation 
and 
$1.5 million being added into a 
retirement plan.
•

fired 
this 
season, 
Beilein has a $3 million buyout. 
That drops to $2 million in 2019-20, 
then by $500,000 each year.
• 
Potential bonuses include 
$25,000 for an NCAA Tournament 
berth, a Big Ten Tournament 
championship or share of the Big 
Ten regular season title.

2021-22 season.

each year.
• 
For making the Frozen 
Four last year, Pearson received a 
bonus of two months’ base salary 
(approximately $58,000).
• 
To buy Pearson out from 
his contract at Michigan Tech, 
Michigan paid $250,000.
• 
If fired without cause, 
Pearson will be paid, “any earned 
but unpaid wages and vacation and 
an amount equivalent to the Base 
Salary in monthly installments 
for the remaining terms of this 
Agreement.” Pearson is required to 
seek another job as soon as possible 

in such a situation.

A moment of weakness 
in a dominating match

It was a one-sided affair.
There’s no other way to put 
it.
In the Michigan volleyball 
team’s sweep of Louisiana 
State on Friday, there were 
zero lead changes and only one 
instance of a tie in score, which 
happened 
in 
the 
opening 
moments of a set. From start 
to 
finish, 
the 
Wolverines 
dominated — except for one 
instance.
In the second set, Michigan 
had 
an 
extended 
scoring 
drought. After leading by 16 
points at 20-4, 
the Wolverines 
allowed 
six 
straight points 
to narrow the 
lead 
to 
just 
ten. It wasn’t 
a scare by any 
means. 
But 
for 
Michigan, 
which had won 
21 straight sets 
— many just as 
dominantly — 
any chink in their armor was a 
notable moment.
After putting on offensive 
pressure 
nearly 
the 
entire 
game, the sudden switch to 
defense caught the Wolverines 
off guard.
Between 
the 
inability 
to transition and adapt to 
the Tigers’ new short serve 
offered the first looks at what 
an unorganized, unprepared 
Michigan team looked like.
“Our defensive effort, there 
were a lot of scrambled plays, 
you know, we have a system 
and a plan, but that system only 
goes so far, then it turns into 
effort,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen.
Seeing 
the 
moment 
of 
weakness, 
Louisiana 
State 
attacked aggressively — paying 
immediate 
dividends. 
And 
thanks to that pressure, its 
defense found improvement 

as 
well, 
exploiting 
poorly 
coordinated responses from 
the 
Wolverines. 
Sophomore 
middle blocker Kiara Shannon 
and 
junior 
outside 
hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom saw their 
attacks turn into errors as 
they failed to keep the hits in 
bounds.
And just as much as it was 
an impressive showing by the 
Tigers, even if for an instance, 
it 
was 
more 
of 
Michigan 
shooting itself in the foot. Of 
the six points Louisiana State 
scored, four of them were 
attacking 
errors 
from 
the 
Wolverines.
“It was a weird set because 
we really only 
rotated 
five 
times 
and 
we 
didn’t even get 
through a full 
rotation,” Rosen 
said. 
“Which 
is odd. Usually 
you get through 
three or close 
to three. I think 
it was a weird 
game, we scored 
points at a really 
fast rate, we got runs like crazy.
“I think maybe your serve 
receive gets a little bit lull 
because you aren’t in it very 
often. You were point scoring 
or serving, playing defense and 
all of a sudden we’re not on 
serve receive much.”
In an otherwise flawless 
game, the short lapse gave the 
team a glimpse of something 
it had avoided all season — 
carelessness. After building 
and maintaining a large lead 
for so long, Michigan had a 
sense of security that lulled it 
to negligence.
But it was only momentary 
as a brief timeout was all it 
took to get regrouped and 
revitalized — closing the set on 
a 5-1 run.
That run led to a 25-11 finish 
on the night, as the Wolverines 
kept 
their 
perfect 
record 
intact.

Hudson “trending” in second year at VIPER

Khaleke Hudson broke fully 
into the spotlight last season for 
the Michigan football team.
Taking over at VIPER for fan 
favorite Jabrill Peppers, Hudson 
made third-team All-Big Ten, 
won a Big Ten Defensive Player 
of the Week award and even tied 
the NCAA record for tackles for 
loss in a game with eight against 
Minnesota. Hudson finished the 
season with 83 tackles and two 
interceptions.
This season, Hudson, now 
a junior, has solidified himself 
as one of the top talents on a 
defense that returned nearly all 
of its starters.
Last week against Western 
Michigan, as the 19th-ranked 
Wolverines 
dominated 
from 
start to finish, Hudson made his 
mark.
Midway through the second 
quarter with Michigan up 28-0 
and the Broncos barely clinging 
to life, Western Michigan faced 
4th-and-1. Its quarterback John 

Wassink faked a handoff and 
took off to the left.
Hudson shed a block, planted 
his feet and upended Wassink at 
the line of scrimmage, forcing 
a change of possession and 
dashing any hopes the Broncos 
had left.
It was one of 
Hudson’s 
six 
tackles 
in 
the 
game, and while 
that isn’t an eye-
popping number, 
it does represent 
Hudson’s 
solid 
play.
“He’s 
coming 
on,” 
said 
linebackers coach 
Al 
Washington 
on Wednesday. “Khaleke has 
done a very good job. I thought 
last week he made incremental 
steps, and he’s gonna continue 
to do that. But I’m very pleased 
with Khaleke, and I’m really 
impressed with his ability to 
lead. You know, he’s trying to do 
a better job leading. But I’m very 
excited about this week for him.”

The 
leadership 
facet 
of 
Hudson’s game is an interesting 
one. As stated, this is a defense 
with tons of experience, which 
breeds leadership.
Hudson’s leadership abilities 
can be categorized by what he 
does, not necessarily what he 
says.
According 
to Washington, 
Hudson took a 
majority of the 
snaps this week 
in practice, a 
testament 
to 
his willingness 
to work despite 
what 
he’s 
already proven.
“By 
his 
actions, 
I 
mean, 
you 
take 
yesterday, he took the bulk of the 
reps,” Washington said. “(He’s) 
just rolling. And he didn’t balk, 
didn’t do anything, you know, 
he just grinded through it. And 
that’s the type of leadership that 
I think a lot of younger guys see 
impacting more than what he 
says.”

That side of things also shows 
itself on special teams. As a 
freshman, Hudson saw almost 
all of his playing time on special 
teams, tying for the team-lead 
with two blocked punts.
Since then, he’s spent nearly 
every defensive snap at VIPER, 
and it would be understandable 
if the coaches or even Hudson 
himself wanted to give him his 
rest on special teams plays.
But just last week, against 
the Broncos, Hudson lined up 
as Western Michigan set to punt 
the ball away. He ripped through 
the line at the snap, along with 
four other Wolverines, split 
Western Michigan’s personal 
protectors and blocked the third 
punt of his career.
Washington sees that play and 
the fourth down stop as signs of 
what is to come for Hudson this 
season.
“Those 
things 
piggyback 
on each other and start to 
snowball,” 
Washington 
said. 
“It’ll continue. We’ve still got 
work to do, but he’s trending. 
His head is down.”

James Hudson, Jalen Mayfield pushing for starting tackle positions

Offensive tackle has long 
been a trouble spot for the 
Michigan football team.
Midway through the 2016 
season, 
Grant 
Newsome’s 
career-ending 
knee 
injury 
forced Ben Bredeson to start at 
left tackle. He played like you’d 
expect from a true freshman 
lineman in the Big Ten: poorly. 
Bredeson then moved to guard 
full time last offseason, moving 
now-NFL center Mason Cole 
out of position to left tackle in 
2017.
Still, the Wolverines hoped 
to develop Nolan Ulizio, Jon 
Runyan Jr. or Juwann Bushell-
Beatty into a bona fide starter 
in 2017; all three had been in 
the program for at least three 
years.
Instead, right tackle was 
consistently one of Michigan’s 
most 
glaring 
weaknesses 
last 
season. 
Ulizio 
started 
the opener but was pulled by 
halftime. Bushell-Beatty self-
admittedly 
struggled 
with 
confidence. Runyan looked like 
he did, too. 
So 
began 
another 
year 
of 
question 
marks 
at 
the 
position. 
Though 
redshirt 
freshman James Hudson and 
true freshman Jalen Mayfield 
generated buzz in fall camp, 
Bushell-Beatty 
and 
Runyan 
started at right and left tackle, 
respectively, two weeks ago 
against Notre Dame. Familiar 
issues 
returned. 
Michigan’s 
offensive line was out-manned 
by the Fighting Irish’s front 
seven, allowing pressure and 
hits on junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson throughout. 
But the Wolverines didn’t 
panic after one game. They 
stuck with the same line, 
and it paid off with over 300 
rushing yards against Western 
Michigan last week.

“(The line was) much better 
in week two than in week one 
but a work in progress still,” 
said 
offensive 
line 
coach 
Ed Warinner. “(It was) Jon 
Runyan’s 
first 
two 
starts 
as 
an 
offensive 
tackle. 
He’s 
played 
solid 
and 
continues 
to 
improve 
there. 
Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty 
has 
improved, 
and I think he’s 
played better as 
well. I still want 
them to push and develop.”
It 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
Michigan’s offensive line is set, 
though. Warinner mentioned 
starting roles are evaluated 

regularly based off practice 
and game performances. In his 
words, “anything can happen 
moving forward.”
That should perk the ears 
of Hudson and 
Mayfield. 
Both 
have 
rotated 
with the starters 
in 
practice 
— 
Mayfield 
takes 
about 25 percent 
of his reps with 
the ones while 
Hudson gets a 
“little” 
more 
— 
and 
both 
could see larger 
roles if the starters’ struggles 
re-emerge.
Warinner 
already 
thinks 
Mayfield is “physically and 
mentally” ahead of where he 

should be, even without the 
luxury of enrolling a semester 
early.
“Over the summer they’ve 
come a long way,” Warinner 
said. “I wasn’t 
sure 
with 
Jaylen how the 
summer 
would 
affect 
him, 
going 
through 
Summer Bridge, 
but he’s really 
come 
on 
and 
works every day 
with the twos 
and gets some 
work with the 
ones every day. His progress is 
great.”
Despite 
the 
extra 
year, 
Hudson is also just getting 
acclimated to the Wolverines’ 

offensive line. He switched to 
tackle from defensive end last 
spring — a change difficult 
for even the most athletic and 
cerebral players.
“His 
growth 
over the summer 
and 
then 
this 
fall 
has 
been 
tremendous,” 
Warriner 
said. 
“He’s 
fully 
invested 
now 
as an offensive 
lineman. In the 
spring he was 
putting a toe in 
the water to see 
what he thought. He gave us a 
good effort and showed some 
talent, but there were times 
it was frustrating for him 
because it was just so new. To 

go against our defensive ends 
every day, it’s challenging. 
He’s way beyond that. He’s 
gained confidence in himself 
and his ability to do the job, 
knowing what to do when he’s 
out there.”
Both Hudson and Mayfield 
saw action at the end of 
Saturday’s game. Given the 
lopsided 
score 
and 
weak 
opposition, they couldn’t show 
much of real significance.
But when asked about the 
offensive line during Monday’s 
press conference, coach Jim 
Harbaugh praised his young 
tackles unprompted.
“It was good to see Jaylen 
Mayfield get in the game, it 
was good to see James Hudson 
get in the game and do well,” 
Harbaugh said. “We’ve got 
good hopes for both those 
tackles. It’s kind of a race to 
see how fast they can get up to 
speed.”
Michigan undoubtedly has a 
delicate balance to strike with 
its tackles. Based on their age, 
neither Runyan nor Bushell-
Beatty are long-term answers, 
and their lapses at Notre 
Dame put pressure to develop 
youthful reserves faster. But 
that can backfire, especially 
with offensive linemen.
“If you put a young guy in 
there before he’s ready, you 
could ruin him, really set him 
back,” Warinner said. “If you 
bring him along at a pace he 
can handle, then you’ve got 
something for a long time.”
There’s no easy answer for 
the Wolverines, and it’s still 
early for Hudson and Mayfield. 
But the pair do provide a 
glimmer of hope for Michigan 
at tackle — finally.
“They’re in the ballpark (of 
starting),” Warriner said. “So 
that bodes well for us. (We) 
want depth there. … Whether 
they’re the best player at the 
position? Time will tell.”

Call it fake, call it Neo-Dadaism: 
Absurdist internet humor is art

The 
most 
common 
explanation among people who 
critically engage with absurdist 
internet humor is to claim a 
resurgence of Neo-Dadaism. 
A 
quick 
Google 
search 
of 
the two pulls up an endless 
list of cultural think pieces 
that position the two artistic 
movements as parallels. The 
primary aim seems to be, more 
than artistic analysis, some 
proof of the validity of this 
specific movement.
“For an art historian, Neo-
Dada is a very specific term for 
a few artists in the ’60s,” Art 
History lecturer Tara Ward said 
in an interview with The Daily. 
“People like (Jasper) Johns who 
were playing around, not only 
with popular culture, but using 
some irony.”
Johns, who’s also claimed 
by abstract expressionism and 
pop art, is best known for his 
depictions and recreations of 
the American flag.
“The 
great 
story 
about 
Johns is he produces a series 
of bronze beer cans that are a 
response to his dealer saying 
that this dealer could sell some 
beer cans that de Kooning had 
thrown away,” Ward said. “So 
Johns kind of goes, ‘Here sell 
them.’ And of course they did 
and made a fortune.”
“But this is all going back to 
earlier movements in the 20th 
century like True Dada, which 
goes in a variety of different 
directions, 
but 
was 
always 
aimed 
at 
being 
somewhat 
controversial, 
sometimes 
in 
very political ways,” Ward said. 
“And then there are people like 
Duchamp and Picabia who are 
posing interesting questions, 
but within an almost juvenile 
sense of humor.”
A movement of avant-garde 
art in the early 20th century, 
Dadaism and its precursors of 
anti-art sought to challenge 
what was considered art.
“The thing that I was looking 
at this morning that would 
recall these words to me … the 
whole Kanye/PornHub thing 
that 
just 
happened, 
where 
he’s the creative director of 
their 
awards,” 
Ward 
said. 
“The question is: Is that a 
joke? Are we supposed to take 
that seriously or is that just so 
ridiculous that we’re supposed 
to react to it?”
Reaction is essential to, and 
the chief aim of, most Dadaist 
art.
A mere 28 years into the life 
of the Internet, it has become 
a society that has reached a 
self-reflexive stage. Absurdist 
internet humor, like absurdist 
humor and art of the early 20th 
century, rejects aesthetics of 
capitalism, logic and reason in 
order to pronounce the futile 
nature of existence. Only now 
the “world” that is dark and 
unrelenting isn’t necessarily 
the physical world at all. It’s the 
world of the internet.
The creation of the internet, 
in a sense, was the creation 
of a new world — a world that 

is moving through the same 
artistic 
movements 
as 
the 
physical world. Only the online 
world is privileged with the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
physical 
world. Even when its humor 
is self-referential, its modes 
of reference are learned from 
outside itself.
And absurdist internet humor 
is critiquing and parodying the 
society of the internet, even 
more than it is the physical 
world. 
Faux 
profundity 
is 
blown apart by 
memes like “we 
live in a society” 
and “fellas is it 
gay” that make 
a 
joke 
of 
the 
homophobic 
rhetoric 
and 
toxic masculinity 
that fills forums 
on 
4chan 
and 
Reddit.
“Think about 
Rauschenberg 
taking 
essentially 
trash, 
but 
also 
pointedly 
historically 
meaningful 
trash. 
There 
is 
this 
latent 
meaning 
that 
then 
they’re 
remaking 
and 
sort of activating, 
but sort of not,” 
Ward 
said. 
“Which is, again, 
this really weird 
space of, ‘Okay, 
are you actually 
saying this? Or 
are you negating 
this? Where are we here?’”
This constant regeneration 
is essential to this kind of 
humor. Memes are better when 
they reference other memes. 
Jokes are smarter when they 
reference other jokes.
“In my interaction with it, I 
guess I would define absurdist 
humor as the logical extension 
of 
an 
ironic/Postmodern 
conceptualization of culture,” 
Derek Triebwasser, an LSA 
and Music, Theatre & Dance 
junior, said. “My sense of this 
humor is that we, as content 
creators and consumers, are 
perceptually 
aware 
of 
the 

degree of abstraction of a meme 
… despite potentially being 
unable to voice this.”
Triebwasser interacts with 
absurdist 
internet 
culture 
primarily through Twitter and 
prides themself on their ability 
to curate content. Like many 
others in this corner of the 
internet, Triebwasser isn’t a 
content generator, but interacts 
with 
the 
community 
as 
a 
collector — the kind of collector 
that, Ward noted, 
existed 
before 
the internet.
“I’m not really 
a 
big 
fan 
of 
super, super dark 
humor, which I 
think makes up 
a lot of internet 
culture 
these 
days,” LSA junior 
Grace Toll said.
Another 
content collector, 
Toll finds herself 
drawn 
to 
the 
lighter 
sides 
of 
absurdist 
internet culture, 
favoring 
Wholesome 
Memes and what 
she calls “goofy” 
humor over the 
darker, 
more 
cynical sides of 
the internet.
“My 
favorite 
meme 
right 
now 
is 
the 
‘Do 
y’all 
here 
sumn’ 
meme,” 
Toll 
said. 
“So 
it’s the picture 
of 
Squidward, 
and you use it if 
someone says something you’re 
choosing to ignore.”
“And all the sub-memes of 
it, like the one with the fish 
that’s ‘Girl, I hear sumn,’” she 
continued, noting how memes 
tend to communicate with one 
another.
Even in more benign forms, 
these memes are still operating 
under the same principles of 
absurdism 
and 
regeneration 
that Ward mentioned. They 
pull images, like SpongeBob 
and 
Squidward, 
who 
are 
recognizable even to users who 
haven’t seen the show, from the 
pop culture canon and apply 

text that makes them more 
absurd.
We see this happening with 
cartoon characters precisely 
because they carry a certain 
degree of absurdity within the 
context of their show. Then, 
pulled out of context and 
paired with text, the absurdity 
is amplified.
That’s how many of these 
memes operate. Users identify 
images with some degree of 
essential absurdity — cartoons, 
stock photos, stills from reality 
TV — and use them to create 
something even more absurd.
“Pre-internet, there was a 
lot of like, ‘How do I figure out 
the unknown musician?’” Ward 
said. “So there was this cult 
of people collecting X, Y or Z, 
going to specific places to learn 
about that.”
“And 
so 
there’s 
also 
something about these that has 
that in it. Can I find the weird 
thing? Can I be the first one to 
show you the weird thing? Can 
I trace where this came from? 
Where am I in the hierarchy? 
That really just echoes that 
person 
who 
knew 
all 
the 
obscure albums,” Ward said.
When looking for absurdist 
content, Triebwasser is most 
taken 
by 
the 
simultaneous 
abstraction and distillation of 
different meme formats.
“The galaxy brain meme 
is both more concrete and 
abstract than a ‘normal’ (Advice 
Animals) style meme as it makes 
a direct comparison between an 
established cultural scale and 
any number of new concepts,” 
Triebwasser said.
Advice Animals are — and, 
at this point, mostly were — 
an early meme format that 
employed simple stock images 
and impact font to create a 
cast of characters. Success Kid, 
Advice Dog and Conspiracy 
Keanu should be somewhat 
familiar to anyone who has 
been online in the past decade. 
They are simple and easy to 
regenerate 
formulas, 
each 
with a specific set of rules. 
Like comic superheroes, their 
monikers give users all the 
necessary information as to 
how to interact with them.
But now, in the era of the 
Galaxy 
Brain 
meme, 
the 
rules are less clear, and the

characters are less concrete.
“Because we have empty 
space, anything can be placed 
here, including other memes, 
references, conceptualizations, 
et cetera,” Triebwasser said. 
“This meme, I think, is a 
poignant example of the degree 
of abstraction as a scale for 
humor. As the galaxy brain 
expands, its comparisons on 
the left become more and more 
‘abstract.’”
Triebwasser points to other 
popular meme formats — Guy 
Looking Back and Grasping 
Hands — as examples of this 
blank space abstraction. The 
“rules” associated with the 
Advice Animals are wiped 
away and the visual product is 
able to move into a space that 
is more abstract, and more 
absurd.
“I think that the internet 
fosters this sort of ideation 
due to its accessibility and 
impersonality,” 
Triebwasser 
said. “Just as we abstract 
humor, the way of interaction 
on the internet is also bounded 
by ways of or degrees of 
abstraction.”
For Triebwasser, the Twitter 
profile is an abstraction of 
the Twitter user, and the 
platform itself is integral to 
its proliferation of this kind 
of 
humor. 
In 
that 
sense, 
the 
platform 
adheres 
more 
closely 
to 
a 
Dadaist 
rejection 
of 
authorship than 
a 
Neo-Dadaist 
celebration of it.
“When 
you 
see 
a 
really 
popular 
tweet, 
unless 
you 
already 
know 
the account you 
probably 
will 
never remember 
the 
account 
that 
tweeted 
it,” Triebwasser 
said. 
“I 
don’t 
know if you’d 
even 
look 
at 
their 
(Twitter 
handle), you just 
have the meme 
for itself.” 
This distance, Ward asserts, 
allows the internet to get away 
with a darker form of humor 
— like the Tide Pod challenge 
that dominated Twitter feeds 
earlier this year — that is 
harder to stomach in real life.
“If, sitting in the dining hall, 
I challenge the kid across from 
me to drink a gallon of milk … 
I have to sit there and watch 
the consequences of that kid 
vomiting,” Ward said. “But you 
don’t if it’s on the internet. So 
there’s a distance there that 
perhaps allows this to happen 
more or at least puts you in a 
different relationship to it.”
This distance between the 
subject 
and 
the 
consumer 
makes it easier to consume this 
type of humor. But consumers 
with 
different 
degrees 
of 
knowledge as to the validity 
and origins of the joke are 
placed in different positions. 
Especially when it comes to 
something like Tide Pods.

“That 
one 
was 
very 
pointedly, ‘You either know 
or you don’t.’ That was about 
getting other people to react,” 
Ward said. “The news covering 
Tide Pods struck me as exactly 
what that aimed at doing.”
A Twitter user can tweet a 
photo of a bowl of Tide Pods 
with the caption “Dinner” and 
have it taken two very different 
ways by different users.
“Personally I thought it was 
funny for a little bit,” Toll said. 
“You look at one and you think, 
‘That does look good. I do want 
to eat that.’ But obviously you 
don’t – that was definitely a 
meme that was popular with 
younger people.”
The divide of knowledge 
among internet users and Tide 
Pod challengers was also an 
age divide. Younger users — 
mostly teens — who grew up 
with the absurdist language of 
this community but had not yet 
developed the critical skills to 
understand all of its nuances 
drove 
the 
meme 
to 
more 
dangerous levels.
“Part of the pleasure of it 
was knowing that other people 
didn’t get it. I think where 
it gets dark is what are the 
consequences of not getting 
it,” Ward said. “Maybe it’s just 
that you’re old and don’t get it 
and maybe it’s 
death.”
Even in more 
benign 
cases, 
the 
distinction 
between 
who 
gets 
the 
joke 
and who doesn’t 
is 
constantly 
reaffirmed 
online 
— 
most 
prevalently 
through the label 
“local.”
“Locals” 
are 
Twitter 
users 
who post sincere 
content that can 
be seen as the 
direct 
opposite 
of 
absurdist 
Twitter. 
They 
reaffirm the very 
things Dadaism, 
Neo-Dadaism 
and 
internet 
meme 
culture 
are 
critiquing: 
traditional 
aesthetics 
of 
beauty, capitalism and faith in 
the world as a good and just 
place.
“Locals” are usually white, 
well-adjusted, suburban teens 
who 
retweet 
memes 
three 
iterations 
behind 
absurdist 
Twitter. Offline, they might be 
called “normies.” And offline, 
they 
wouldn’t 
necessarily 
interact with their darker, more 
cynical contemporaries in this 
way. But online, with enough 
retweets, your tweet can end 
up on anyone’s timeline. And 
next thing you know, your 
tweet about eating pizza and 
watching “The Office” that 
was a hit with your friend is the 
butt of some stranger’s joke.
“People 
who 
didn’t 
understand 
that 
kind 
of 
humor,” Toll defined when 
asked about “locals.” “The 
kind of people who would see a 
meme that was popular months 
ago and say, ‘This is hilarious, 

 Absurdist 

internet humor, 

like absurdist 

humor and art 

of the early 20th 

century, rejects 

the aesthetics 

of capitalism, 

logic and reason 

in order to 

pronounce the 

futile nature of 

existence

Users identify 

images with 

some degree of 

essential absurdity 

— cartoons, stock 

photos, stills from 

reality TV — and 

use them to create 

something even 

more absurd

I’ve never seen this before.’”
People in weird or absurdist 
Twitter communities have latched 
onto “locals” as both antithetical 
to themselves and an additional 
stream of content production.
“I think that’s a combination 
of content lacking a specific 
intensity or direction of nuance, 
combined with either the ideals or 
the personhood that represents,” 
Triebwasser said.
Beyond the local/weird divide, 
Western culture has always been 
preoccupied with tests that create 
hierarchies of knowledge. People 
who know the most, who can 
tick the most cultural boxes, are 
positioned at the top. Then come 
those who don’t know or don’t 
know as much, and finally in last 
place are the people who discover 
the list only after it has lost its 
novelty.
Ward points to Tom Wolfe’s 
“Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.”
“It has a list of all the things that 
can get you high, and I remember 
people reading that and it being 
like a checklist in sort of a similar 
way,” Ward said. “There was this 
play of: Do you know all of these? 
Have you tried all of these? What 
do they do?”
Meme culture operates in 
similar ways, but its methods of 
interactions and communication 
are intrinsically tied to the 
structure 
of 
platforms 
like 
Twitter and, to a lesser degree, 
Instagram. So while comparisons 
can be made to older forms of 
culture — literature, art and music 
— their power is tied to the way 
these sites are constructed and 
displayed.
“Most important for meme/
Twitter culture specifically, I 
think, is the way of consumption,” 
Triebwasser said. “Cell phones 
have adapted our consumption 
patterns to be basically unceasing, 
and the content follows this 
habituation.”
Even the act of scrolling 
through a feed impacts the way 
the information on the feed is 
consumed and interpreted.
“The way of experiencing a 
Twitter timeline as a stream of 
consciousness really affects our 
cognition,” Triebwasser said.
The 
endless 
stream 
of 
content pushes humor toward 
the mundane. Not the blissful 
mundane of “Local” Twitter, but 
the ceaseless mundane tragedies 
of modern existence — what 
Triebwasser calls “the solidarity 
of 
day-to-day 
experience.” 
Accounts 
like 
sosadtoday 
play on a sort of communal 
existential dread, and rely on self-
deprecating jokes about the user’s 
(or the user’s online persona’s) 
own mental illness.
“It’s best exemplified by short 
quips that become a vehicle for 
communication. 
‘Might 
fuck 
around and (blank)’ ‘(Morning 
salutation), 
(blank) 
let’s 
get 
this 
(blank),’” 
Triebwasser 
said. 
“These 
formats 
for 
communication 
become 
not 
only a status for complexity and 

popularity of humor, but then are 
abstracted back into everyday 
life.”
Like “we live in a society” or 
“fellas is it gay,” these phrases 
become memes on and offline. 
But, this offline life is not limited 
to text-based memes. Vines have 
outlived their platform (uploads 
to the short-form video app were 
stopped in October 2016). Twitter 
users have taken the audio from 
these videos and turned them into 
similarly memed phrases. “My 
dick fell off” and “What the fuck 
is up, Kyle” recall both the audio 
and video of their original Vine 
format.
Triebwasser points to Vine 

as an integral platform in the 
transition from Advice Animals 
and other impact font meme 
formats to the more absurdist 
and abstract meme forms we see 
today.
But is this new, post-Vine, post-
Impact font meme space Neo-
Dada? Not exactly, Triebwasser 
says.
“I would say the comparison 
to Dada is apt due to Dada’s 
emphasis 
on 
irony, 
anti-
capitalism, aestheticism, rejection 
of logic and reason, et cetera,” 
Triebwasser said. “But isn’t it 
more culturally and artistically 
accurate to conceive of it as its 
own genre?”
The 
main 
reason 
for 
Triebwasser’s assertion is that the 
internet is a “radial operator” with 
a speed and reach which cannot 
be matched in physical culture.
“If you conceptualize it as a 
format for communication, you 
see the way of communicating 
changes or evolves with increased 
interaction with it,” Triebwasser 
said.
Increased interaction is also 
colored by the way the platforms 
filter content. News articles and 
photos of friends are filtered 
in-between memes and jokes.
“You read some horrible news 
and there’s a joke after it and that 
is why something that’s really 
stupid on its own can make you 
laugh or make you want to show 

someone else,” Ward said. 
While a great deal of the 
content produced in this vein 
is self-referential or, at least, 
participates is an established 
“canon” of images that make fun 
or critique the way people use 
and communicate on the internet, 
sometimes purely novel memes 
are developed.
Triebwasser is reminded of 
“Dat Boi,” a pixelated cartoon frog 
riding a unicycle that appeared 
online, seemingly out of nowhere.
“There was no existing frog 
emoji or play on the word boy 
at that time,” Triebwasser said. 
“That was notable enough.”
It was, Triebwasser recalls, 
a purely non-referential meme 
— alone among its kind to rise to 
such viral levels. It proves this 
niche is also a generating force, 
a movement with the ability to 
recognize and generate absurdism 
and weirdness in the world.
While a majority of this culture 
is visual, the main platform 
through 
which 
participants 
interact is Twitter, a primarily 
text-based platform, Twitter’s 
days could be numbered.
Triebwasser 
sees 
parallels 
between the decline of Twitter 
and the decline of platforms like 
Facebook and Tumblr that used 
to hold the top position in the 
culture.
“The 
way 
that 
Twitter’s 
administration 
is 
handling 
anything is not happy or fun. 
Verifying Neo-Nazis, and recently 
there was a purge of Leftist 
Twitter accounts that all just 
got deleted,” Triebwasser said. 
“People I follow are on their third 
or fourth account because they 
keep getting deleted.”
Twitter users who are active in 
meme and absurdist culture don’t 
feel like the platform has room for 
them anymore.
“There’s a small but noticeable 
ideation on Twitter that we’re 
being edged out,” Triebwasser 
said.
Whatever’s 
next 
for 
the 
community, Triebwasser feels 
confident they’ll find a way to 
exist and thrive online.
“The culture as a social force 
will always exist and we/they/it 
will always find a way to exist,” 
Triebwasser said.
So, it’s clear that absurdist 
humor aims to generate a reaction. 
It rejects traditional aesthetics 
of beauty, logic and capitalism 
in favor of a visual language that 
reflects the darkness, absurdity 
and unknowability of modern life. 
Most of its content is referential 
— stock images, internet trends 
and visual culture in the Western 
canon — but some is novel.
While it may bear some of 
the skeletal work of the two, 
it’s not Dada or Neo-Dada. This 
thing, this Weird Twitter/Meme 
Culture/Online Humor thing is 
a beast of its own creation — an 
artistic movement that, like all, 
was born from what came before 
it, but has quite rapidly become 
something wholly its own.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘REBEL HEART’

It’s no coincidence that the full 
moon is red in First Aid Kit’s new 
music video for “Rebel Heart.” 
Red is the color of the passion 
that drives rebellion, the color of 
individuality, of love that rages 
and dreadfully quells, of blood. It’s 
the color of the heart itself.
“Rebel Heart” — a song from 
Ruins, a stellar avalanche of an 
album released back in Jan. — is 
a tale of dread and insecurity, in 
which the magnetic folk duo croon 
lines like, “Why do I keep trying / 
To be someone I’ll never be / I keep 
seeing her in everyone / Everyone 
but me.” The music video tells the 
story of a séance. Sisters Klara and 
Johanna Söderberg are dressed 
in red, with the latter sporting a 
necklace with a prominent heart-
shaped pendant, and surrounded 
by several silent, blank-faced 
women robed in white (think 
“The Beguiled”).
The video is blurred with the 
warm fuzz of an old movie, and 

full of nods to the horror and 
suspense genres: an eclipse, a TV 
screen flickering Poltergeist-style 
with static, dramatic shadows 
framing each sister’s eyes as 
she speaks into a lipstick-red 
telephone, the women in white 
lurching in unison on the wooden 

floor in twitchy motions that evoke 
“The Exorcist.” A group of girls 
in a circle, holding hands while 
another girl rises off the table and 
floats, her red heart pulsing and 
glowing beneath her white dress. 
A creepy, sleepover-esque hair-
braiding circle — which, if it isn’t 
already out of some horror movie, 
certainly should be.
Beyond its aesthetics, though, 
the video bears many of the 

hallmarks 
that 
make 
First 
Aid Kit’s videos so great: The 
nostalgic drama steeped in horror 
recalls the haunting high school 
prom from “Fireworks,” and 
the maneuvering between the 
two sisters echoes the narrative 
duality of “It’s a Shame.” The 
video reminds us of one of the 
most alluring aspects of the band’s 
music — that when they sing of 
heartbreak and dread, they sing 
of it together. When they enter a 
creepy castle under a full, blood-
red moon, where the hallways are 
dark and the safety of one’s heart 
is called into question, they do it 
together.
And later, when they leave the 
castle and speed away down a dirt 
road lit only by the moon and their 
headlights, toward an obscure and 
frightening red future, they do 
that together, too.

There’s 
a 
sequence 
late 
in 
Boots 
Riley’s 
breakout 
summer hit “Sorry to Bother 
You” when protagonist Cassius 
Green (Lakeith Stanfield, “Get 
Out”), 
the 
once 
down-on-
his-luck telemarketer turned 
rising company star, is faced 
with a Faustian opportunity 
from 
international 
super-
corporation C.E.O. Steve Lift 
(Armie Hammer, “Call Me by 
Your Name”). Given a taste of 
the untold riches that follow 
selling 
one’s 
soul, 
Green 
must decide to what extent 
his values (versus his wallet) 
will drive his decision. Now, 
such an epic crucible could 
be portrayed simply enough 
— a check on the table and a 
C.E.O.’s 
outstretched 
hand 
— but in wonderful “Sorry to 
Bother You” fashion, Riley 
doesn’t make it that easy.
In a film built around a 
telemarketer’s 
supernatural 
ability 
to 
perfectly 
code-
switch into his “white voice” 
(the movie magic of the scenes 
supplied in a dubbed voiceover 
from David Cross of “Arrested 
Development”), the bar for 
what is considered shocking 
begins to climb. For Riley to 
get his point across, to really 
drive his message home, he 
doesn’t hold his punches.
The absurdism of “Sorry 
to Bother You” is a matter 

of form following function. 
Riley’s film is an extended 
conceit on the financial divide 
in our country, a cavernous 
separation 
that 
has 
only 
grown in recent decades. The 
absurd, real-life disparity in 

resources between those who 
have and those who do not is 
represented 
by 
fantastical, 
reality-bending sci-fi events 
and societal developments in 
the film’s alternate U.S. It’s 
not a new idea to use blown-

out-of-proportion 
analogies 
when 
working 
towards 
social change (see “A Modest 
Proposal”), and while I doubt 
Riley will ever be Jonathan 
Swift, his methodology is true. 
Creating space for dialogue by 
expanding the conversation 
past what is real and true 
and 
already 
proposed 
can 
bring in new eyes and ears. 
Shocking, absurdist pieces of 
art can’t solve any problems 
directly (probably), but they 
no doubt can help to bring 
the championed issues closer 
to the forefront of people’s 
minds. 
Additionally, 
Riley’s 
absurdism has a unique effect 
when carrying the weight 
of such real-life absurdities. 
In the film, without getting 
into too many spoilers, Lift’s 
idea for an army of workers 
under lifetime contracts who 
work and eat and sleep all in 
the factory (for efficiency, of 
course), sounds like a horrid 
breach of everything humane 
and 
acceptable 
in 
modern 
society. It’s the prospective 
distance 
between 
what 
is 
shown on screen — the nasty, 
unacceptable acts of a business 
magnate who has freed himself 
from all moral ties — and what 
we see in our own world that 
gives us the opportunity to ask 
“How absurd is this, really?” 
It’s those kinds of questions 
that make “Sorry to Bother 
You” a valuable piece of social 
criticism.

The creation of YouTube 
allowed for the widespread 
distribution of DIY web series 
and home videos. The social 
media platform also provided 
niche communities a place to 
broadcast their special brand 
of weird.
The 
Lonely 
Island, 
a 
comic-rap group made up of 
“Saturday Night Live” alums 
Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer 
and 
Jorma 
Taccone, 
went 
viral simultaneously with the 
launch of YouTube. Their SNL 
Digital Short “Lazy Sunday” 
helped make their pseudo-
band as well as the social 
media platform gain celebrity 
status.
However, The Lonely Island 
doesn’t write your typical rap 
songs. Their music videos 
satirize popular culture and 
feature 
themselves 
with 
famous guest stars dressed 
like nerds with unibrows, 
sporting literal gift boxes as 
their “package” and other 
showcases of absurdist humor.
As their song titles suggest 
(“Jizz In My Pants,” “I Just Had 
Sex,” etc.), TLI both appeals to 
and undermines “bro comedy” 
culture, best represented by 
the 
filmographies 
of 
Seth 
Rogen, 
Vince 
Vaughn 
and 
Adam 
Sandler. 
Often, 
the 
trio makes fun of stereotypes 
of fratty material through 
extreme interpretations.
For example, in “Dick in 
a Box,” Samberg and Justin 
Timberlake sing, “A girl like 
you needs somethin’ real / 
Wanna get you somethin’ from 
the heart / … It’s my dick in a 
box.” Here, the group mocks 
the notion that women would 
appreciate some guy exposing 
himself without consent and 
laughs at the entitlement of 

men who approach situations 
in this manner.
Although all three members 
self-identify as feminists and 
use surreal and exaggerated 
elements to satirize norms of 
masculinity, their popularity 
still relies on the consumption 
and enjoyment of the “man-
child” 
act. 
Samberg 
even 
admits he relies on topics that 

made him laugh as a kid, which 
Jesse David Fox of Vulture 
summarized as, “Dick jokes. 
Teenage boys love ‘em. So the 
Lonely Island keeps delivering 
‘em.”
Good Neighbor Stuff, the 
SNL Digital Short successors 
to TLI, also got their start on 
YouTube. Current SNL cast 
members Kyle Mooney and 
Beck Bennett were two of the 
main members.

GNS 
produced 
“bro 
comedy” low-budget videos 
as 
well, 
mostly 
centering 
around marijuana and the 
awkwardness of daily life. The 
most popular videos on the 
GNS YouTube page include 
shock humor bits titled “is my 
roommate gay?,” “My Mom’s 
a MILF” and “this is how we 
trip.” Similar to TLI, GNS 
both indulges in and satirizes 
expectations of masculinity.
So why does a correlation 
exist 
between 
popular 
absurdist 
humor 
on 
the 
internet 
and 
bro-culture? 
Is 
there 
a 
female-centric 
equivalent to the man-child 
act?
In a roundtable discussion 
on Consequence of Sound, 
Randall 
Colburn 
defined 
the “bro comedy” sub-genre 
as 
following 
a 
friendship 
between men challenged “by a 
female … (in which) the women 
are comically attractive and 
underdeveloped, reduced to 
either manipulating shrews 
or flawless sweethearts … 
(where) bad ‘boys will be boys’ 
behavior is celebrated.”
In 
other 
words, 
“bro 
comedy” 
is 
inherently 
unaccepting of women comics. 
Actually, comedy in general 
is highly misogynistic, with 
some critics, like Christopher 
Hitchens in his 2007 Variety 
article “Why Women Aren’t 
Funny,” attempting to provide 
empirical proof that women 
are biologically unfunny.
Unlike 
micro-budget 
cinema, 
whose 
low-stakes 
open the door for new voices, 
absurdist 
comedy 
has 
not 
provided a similar home for 
women discriminated against 
in their genre and profession. 
Instead, 
men 
continue 
to 
dominate 
the 
creative 
conversation.
Even though groups like 
The Lonely Island and Good 
Neighbor 
Stuff 
challenge 

Where are all the female 
absurdist YouTube stars?

norms of masculinity, their 
type of humor is still limiting 
for both women collaborators 
and consumers.
Despite 
the 
minimal 
amount 
of 
financial 
investment 
necessary 
to 
create 
successful 
absurdist 
humor 
content 
(“Lazy 
Sunday” cost TLI a total of 
$22), no female-led absurdist 
YouTube comics have gained 
popularity the same way as the 
aforementioned SNL alums.
Admittedly, 
Issa 
Rae’s 
more mainstream sense of 
humor allowed her YouTube 
series “The Mis-Adventures 
of 
Awkward 
Black 
Girl” 
to 
become 
the 
critically-

acclaimed “Insecure,” but her 
sitcom-format and comedic 
tone are not a parallel example 
to TLI.
At the moment, there is no 
response to the popularity of 
the “man-child” act. A grown 
man acting like a teenage 
boy with references to crude, 
elementary jokes can thrive, 
even become a comedy icon. A 
trio of “bros” being ridiculous 
can reach over a billion hits 
on YouTube with a video that 
cost the same amount as a 
hardcover novel.
Are 
SNL 
digital 
shorts 
like “Dongs All Over the 
World” or “Natalie’s Rap” the 
female version of absurdist 

comedy? In my opinion, no. 
While 
absolutely 
hilarious, 
these videos rely on the same 
playbook of TLI and GNS — a 
playbook written by and for 
boys.
This 
is 
not 
to 
suggest 
men 
and 
women 
create 
different types of comedy 
because 
of 
their 
gender. 
Instead, this exploration of 
the underground world of 
YouTube comedy seeks to 
bring to attention the lack of 
female voices in a medium 
that should be less restricted 
by gender politics.
Where’s the “sister comedy” 
group? And why haven’t we 
heard of them yet?

Beautiful creations can 
come out of the suburbs; 
Austin Smith is proof

COURTESY OF THE ARTIST

B-SIDE SECONDARY

Austin Smith was four years 
ahead of me at our high school 
in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. We 
had the same art teacher, the 
amazing Peg Pasternak, whose 
investment in her students 
cannot be overstated. Today, 
we’re both still in touch with 
her, but while I’m here in Ann 
Arbor determining what to do 
with my looming adult life, 
Smith is dazzling the world 
with a new form of portraiture.
“When I was younger my 
main medium of art-making 
was drawing and painting — 
and I was always drawn to 
creating portraiture,” Smith 
said in an interview with The 
Daily. “The work I make now 
feels very similar to past work 
I would make, and I see it as an 
evolution in the way I create 
portrait imagery.”
Now 24 years old and living 
in New York City, Smith is a 
self-proclaimed 
multimedia 
artist. He works predominantly 
in the fields of fashion, textile 
and set design. Career interests 
aside, he’s quickly become 
known 
for 
his 
innovative 
use of the human body, most 
often his own, as a canvas. A 
mere glimpse at his Instagram 
profile, 
@empty.pools, 
transports his 41,500 followers 
into a form of fantasyland only 
a supremely imaginative mind 
could conjure up. Photos of 
Smith’s face covered in nails 
and colorful acrylic squares 
mingle with portraits of his 
naturally blue eyes exuding a 
reptilian shade of green, the 
skin surrounding them covered 
in (temporary) tattoos and 
plumes of dark purple makeup. 
 
“I don’t know, I’ve only been 
making this type of work for 
less than a year,” he said of his 
inimitable self-portraits. “I’m 
happy that it’s spread as much 
as it has and I’m not really sure 
I know the full scope of my 
reach.”
So far, Smith’s reach has 
extended to some of the most 
influential figures in fashion. 
Though not a model by trade, 
he has walked runways for the 
likes of Moschino, The Blonds 
and Opening Ceremony, all of 
whom admire his work so much 
they permitted Smith to apply 
his own facial tattooing for the 
shows. Those of us among the 
fashion set know how big of a 
deal that is — it’s not every day 
you see a designer eschewing 
the 
accepted 
standard 
for 
relatively 
uniform 
makeup 
among models. 
“Having people notice my 
work feels amazing, and it’s 
all happened in the last year or 
so,” he said. “When I stopped 
being afraid or doubt the ideas 
I had artistically is when I 
felt like what I was making 
actually could be impactful to 
a lot of people. I met (Jeremy 
Scott, 
creative 
director 
of 
Moschino) out one night at a 
Ladyfag party I was hosting. 
We got dinner and he asked me 
to be a part of his show. You 
never know who you’ll meet on 
a night out in NYC.”
And so it was his charisma, 

coupled with his unabashedly 
raw artistic vision, that has 
cemented Smith’s status as 
the new golden boy of the 
New York cool-kid scene. His 
work serves as but one possible 
introduction to the present 
conversation surrounding the 
role of body in fashion.
“I’ve never thought of what 
I do as body modification, 

because to me, modifying your 
body is a more permanent 
thing.” When I asked how, 
then, he would classify his 
portraiture 
work, 
Smith 
wondered aloud: “More like 
‘body adornment’?”
Whether in the form of 
permanent modifications or 
temporary, 
illusion-inducing 
effects, body alteration has 
always existed in fashion — 
albeit in forms that are perhaps 
less about expression and more 
closely related to aspirational 
femininity. Take the corset, 
the dramatic waist-cinching 
garment that has its roots in 
the 16th century. Panniers 
of the 19th century added 
boning to the lining of women’s 
skirts to create a larger-than-
life 
circumference 
of 
the 
hips. The bustle, emerging 
around the same time, was 
the originator of the faux big-
booty effect. In the late 20th 
Century, designers like Rei 
Kawakubo of Commes des 
Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto 
began pushing boundaries of 
the body in a more abstract 
direction. Kawakubo’s Spring-
Summer 1997 collection, which 

featured pieces with goose 
down-filled lumps intended to 
distort the shape of the female 
figure, is perhaps one of the 
most poignant examples. Smith 
may 
work 
predominantly 
with the face rather than with 
garments, but the concept of 
physical 
transformation 
for 
art’s sake is a concept that has 
carried over into his portraits. 

Regarding 
artistic 

inspirations, 
Smith 
cites 
Pierre 
et 
Gille, 
Dave 
La 
Chapelle, Petra Collins and the 
Instagram-famous duo Fecal 
Matter as some of his greatest. 
He is aware, though, that not 
everyone views his brand of 
physical transformation, from 
creating wire facial jewelry to 
applying copious amounts of 
temporary tattoos, as an art 
form.
“I think some people have 
trouble 
seeing 
what 
I 
do 
as art, or have a hard time 
separating me from the images, 
and assume I’m just parading 
through life as a monster,” 
he said. “I don’t mind that, 
though. I like what I do not 
being for everyone.”
Though 
Smith 
does 
not 
classify his work as body 
modification, I couldn’t resist 
asking him what he thought of 
New York’s A. Human exhibit, 
a 
recently 
opened 
gallery 
experience in Manhattan that 
claims to serve as a “fashion 
showroom from the future” 
devoted 
to 
otherworldly 
adjustments 
to 
the 
body. 
Models within the space are 
said to tout everything from 
“biological heels” — shell-like 
appendages 
extending 
from 
the soles of the feet like fleshy, 
ingrown stilettos — to a pair 
of turquoise shoulder horns 
designed 
in 
collaboration 
with fashion designer Nicola 
Formichetti.
“I’ve been meaning to go,” 
said Smith of the exhibit. “I do 
feel from images I’ve seen that 
it’s pulled a lot of inspiration 
from lesser-known artists I 
follow. I find with everyone 
sharing 
their 
work 
online 
now, it makes it easier for 
larger entities to steal ideas 
from emerging artists with no 
repercussions.”
Of 
course, 
every 
artist 
deserves 
credit 
where 
credit is due. It’s clear that 
Smith is actively seeking out 
opportunities 
where 
he’ll 
receive his fair share of acclaim. 
He’ll be debuting a beauty-
related project with magazine 
Dazed on Sept. 26 and said 
there are more collaborations 
with the publication to come.
“I think people are becoming 
increasingly more interested 
in showing their true selves 
— especially in this politically 
conservative climate,” he said. 
“It takes a lot of courage to step 
out into the world the way you 
truly want to, and that type of 
confidence scares people.”
Smith’s 
trajectory 
makes 
it 
glaringly 
obvious: 
Self-
expression is valuable in its 
every 
manifestation. 
Even 
if you give a few people the 
heebie-jeebies along the way, 
you’re bound to make your high 
school art teacher very, very 
proud.

YouTube. 
It’s 
big. 
It’s 
bad. It’s been integral to the 
discovery, 
incubation 
and 
popularity of some of today’s 
most relevant musical artists. 
Justin Bieber was discovered 
on YouTube and some of 
his music videos are now 
among the most viewed on 
the platform. As a student at 
New York University’s Clive 
Davis Institute of Recorded 
Music, Maggie Rogers rose 
to fame when a video of her 
masterclass 
with 
Pharrell 
went viral, which resulted in 
what is now “Alaska,” her most 
popular single with over 61 
million plays on Spotify. Troye 
Sivan, an international LGBTQ 
icon, was a YouTuber before 
his fame. In fact, if you scroll 
to five years ago, before he 
collabed with Ariana Grande, 
before he came out and before 
he released TRXYE and Blue 
Neighborhood, his channel still 
has relics of his past, including 
two self-created songs: “We’re 
My OTP” and “The Fault In 
Our Stars.”
What do these three artists 
share? They’re almost the same 
age. They’ve all reached the 
level of fame where Billboard 
has 
written 
articles 
about 
them. But perhaps the greatest 
hallmark of their talent is that 
all three of them currently 
use music as their careers. 
Sivan in particular gained a 
following from the vlogs and 
music covers he posted on his 
channel, which propelled him 
to develop a career outside of 
the YouTube space. In recent 
years, however, there’s been 
a new category of YouTube 
music — releases that are 
often nowhere near the same 
level of artistry and skill 
that Sivan embodies in his 

songs, often by creators with 
channels that cover everything 
except music or singing. And 
interests are subjective, sure, 
but some of these creations are 
unequivocally bad; autotune 
can 
help 
immensely 
with 
overall sound and key, as can 
production quality, but neither 
will ever truly replace a gifted 
voice.
It makes sense why vloggers 
would start making songs. For 
one, they’re a relatively low-
effort way to rake in more 
money, as music videos tend to 
offer not only a departure from 
the creator’s norm but also a 
way to hook in new viewers, 
both of which boost views. 
Jake 
Paul’s 
“It’s 
Everyday 
Bro” ticks pretty much all of 
the standard boxes, except 
it also emphasizes the idea 
that just because you can do 
something doesn’t mean you 
should. With a ratio of 3.8 
million likes to 2.5 million 
dislikes, it’s evident that I’m 
not the only one who feels 
that way. From an annoying 
chorus (“It’s every day bro!” 
repeated three times, followed 
by a single “I said it’s everyday 
bro!” which originates from 
how Paul ends his vlogs) to 
lyrics about dropping merch, 
flaunting a Rolex and a jab at 
PewDiePie, “It’s Everyday Bro” 
boils the bougie lives of high-
earning YouTubers down to an 
essence and unpleasantly force 
feeds it to viewers. It’s genius, 
in a way — by making a song 
flaunting his success, Paul is 
essentially capitalizing on it to 
become even more successful, 
regardless of whether or not 
the song is good. And who’s 
to say that he didn’t make it 
bad on purpose? Despite the 
uneven like-ratio, the music 
video currently has 210,632,789 
views, 
which 
according 
to 
tubecalculator.com equates to 
around 390 thousand dollars in 

revenue. 
Perhaps one of the most 
significant 
differences 
between YouTubers making 
music 
and 
“real 
world” 
musicians is that there might 
be more of an expectation 
for 
YouTubers 
to 
produce 
videos that are truly over-
the-top — the whole label of 
being a YouTuber relies on 
them producing video content 
creators, after all. As a general 
rule of thumb, I can usually 
figure out whether or not I’m 
going to end up liking a song 
from the first 10 seconds. But 
listening to music put out by 
a YouTuber means I’m more 
likely to watch the music 
video first rather than audio 
only, and my initial judgment 
hinges much more heavily 
on how good the video is. 
Guy Tang, a YouTuber and 
hairstylist 
known 
for 
his 
colorful hair transformations, 
recently released a music video 
for “#Naked2U,” a remixed 
version of his single. Upon my 
first watchthrough, I caught 
myself cringing at everything 
from the neon paint smothered 
on the dancers to Tang’s ultra-
dramatic 
facial 
expressions 
and awkward dancing. But 
on my second and third run, I 
began to pick up little details 
that I hadn’t noticed before. 
Unlike “It’s Everyday Bro,” 
Guy Tang’s creation preached 
a message of honesty, self-love 
and confidence: One of the 
most significant lyrics in the 
piece is “There’s no regrets / 
I’m proud of who I am.” None 
of this made the choreography 
any less clumsy or the acting 
any better, but I realized that 
most of my negative reaction 
was almost entirely based on 
the visuals rather than the 
audio; although Tang’s vocals 
weren’t record-breaking, they 
weren’t as bad as they could 
have been, and I actually liked 

the instrumental hook. Still, if 
not for this article, I can’t say 
that I would have willingly 
listened to “#Naked2U” for 
fun.
What does it mean to go 
viral in the modern age? At one 
point in time, the Cinnamon 
Challenge was revolutionary, 
and one of the reasons it 
spread so quickly was because 
of how reproducible it was — 
everyone has a spoon and a vial 
of cinnamon in their cabinets. 
But as we graduated from 
eating cinnamon to chugging 
gallons of milk and eating Tide 
pods, what qualifies as unique 
enough 
to 
grab 
attention 
has become more and more 
extreme. Before, it was sucking 
on shot glasses to get Kylie 
Jenner’s lips. Now, Internet 
creators — the very people who 
jump-started the “challenge” 
trends that ruled the web five 
years ago — are going to absurd 
lengths in their attempts to 
stay relevant.
One of YouTube’s calling 
cards is its bite-sized content 
and 
the 
variety 
of 
styles 
available. Movies demand at 
least an hour and a half of 
sustained attention in order for 
all the plot devices to hit where 
it counts while TV shows 
require even more of a time 
commitment 
from 
viewers, 
not to mention that episodes 
usually follow a strict linearity. 
For now, YouTube music is 
just another way the platform 
has 
evolved 
to 
assimilate 
new versions of media. But as 
with nearly all trends in the 
world, there will be a point of 
oversaturation, which raises 
the question of what comes 
next. Then again, there was a 
time where it was impossible to 
make a career out of recording 
your everyday life — and if 
something as banal as vlogging 
can become mainstream, then 
so can anything else, really.

In 
the 
early 
2010s, 
electronic 
music 
producer 
Vektroid — operating under 
the 
alias 
Macintosh 
Plus 
— released Floral Shoppe, a 
full-length studio album that 
pioneered a new sound in 
electronic music. The album 
was coated from front to 
back in ’80s nostalgia, from 
the abundant use of sampled 
lounge music, smooth jazz and 
elevator music to the bright 
pink album cover emblazoned 
with Japanese characters, tile 
flooring and a bust of the Greek 
god Helios. Over the course 
of the album, Vektroid would 
conjure a veritable menagerie 
of 
conflicting 
feelings, 
at 
once both warmly nostalgic 
and deeply unsettling. The 
release 
and 
circulation 
of 
Floral Shoppe would mark the 
beginning of a new subgenre 
within electronic music, a 
subgenre that would rapidly 
grow into an entire artistic 
movement.
“Well that’s all well and 
good, but what exactly is 
Vaporwave?” you might ask. 
Keeping 
things 
(relatively) 
simple, 
Vaporwave 
is 
a 
millennial art movement that 
seeks to convey the angsts 
and joys of the “Internet 
Generation” by appropriating 
old tropes to create new 
statements and 
speculations on 
millennial 
life. 
It’s inextricably 
tied 
to 
the 
past 
— 
more 
specifically 
to 
the 
’80s 
and 
’90s, 
decades 
that 
saw 
the 
emergence 
of 
the information 
age as a part of 
everyday 
life. 
The 
advent 
of 
personal 
computing 
made the world 
smaller 
than 
ever before, and 
a technological 
boom courtesy 
of Japanese tech 
companies saw 
the 
aesthetic 
fixations 
of 
American 
society 
shift 
away from the 
lava lamps and 
shag 
carpets 
of the ’70s to 
a 
decade 
that 
was 
all 
about 
the future. A far cry from 
the 
sleek, 
all-American 
retrofuturist stylings of the 
1950s, the future of the 1980s 
was all about neon pinks, 
Japanese 
characters 
and 
aviator sunglasses. By this 
time, many of these aesthetic 
concepts had already begun to 
manifest themselves in films 
like “Blade Runner,” and later 
“Ghost in the Shell.” Deemed 
“Cyberpunk,” this type of art 
would come to exemplify the 
speculations and musings of 
a society on the cusp of an 
information explosion.
Fast-forward to the 2010s, 
and the children of this era 
have now grown up and are 
creating art of their own. 
The Information Age has not 
only made the world more 
connected, but it has made 
companies more connected 
to consumers. Marketing has 
become less about what the 
consumer thinks and more 
about what they feel. The 
early days of this trend would 
serve as the artistic muse for 
the 
Vaporwave 
movement, 
which seeks to expose the 
complicated 
and 
often 
contradictory 
relationships 
that millennials share with 
the internet age. The images 
associated with Vaporwave 
— from the pixelated look 
of the early-internet to the 
generic sounds of elevator 
music — all share one thing in 
common. They evoke a sense 

of the uncanny valley, or the 
unsettling effect of seeing 
something almost human, but 
not quite. While it typically 
refers to robots, animations 
and other would-be-humans, 
it applies to many Vaporwave 
tropes. These artifacts are 
products of a time when 
companies sought to make 
their consumers feel very 
specific ways. Elevator music, 
for example, is meant to make 
you feel calm and at ease — so 
why doesn’t it?
It’s by exposing this chink 
in 
our 
understanding 
of 
pop culture that Vaporwave 
manages to make us feel 
both at ease and on edge, 
simultaneously 
filled 
with 
nostalgia and angst. It is 
at once about our past and 
our future. As Vaporwave 
matured 
and 
developed, 
it began to grow further 
into the realms of science 
fiction, 
speculative 
fiction 
and surrealism. Vaporwave 
artists were fascinated by 
just how powerfully evocative 
these artifacts could be. The 
movement 
exposed 
deeper 
questions about the effects of 
digitization on our society: 
Why does the soft glow of 
neon make you feel wistful? 
What about a crackling record 
or a Coca-Cola jingle evokes 
such strong feelings when 
placed in the right context? 
Why can a computer glitch 
feel gut-wrenching?
For an artistic 
movement 
that’s so fixated 
on the passage 
of time and the 
creation of new 
from 
the 
old, 
it should come 
as no surprise 
that Vaporwave 
is in fact the 
reincarnation 
of a much older 
idea. I speak, 
of 
course, 
of 
Dada, 
the 
avant-garde art 
movement that 
brought 
forth 
artists like Max 
Ernst, 
Marcel 
Duchamp 
and 
Otto Dix. The 
gathering 
of 
Dada 
artists 
in New York’s 
Cabaret 
Voltaire would 
birth 
some 
of 
the 
Lost 
Generation’s 
most 
identifiable 
visual 
motifs. 
Deemed “anti-art,” the goal 
of Dada was to expose the 
consumerist values of post-
war society and convey them 
through 
repurposing 
the 
ordinary and familiar into the 
bizarre and unsettling. If the 
ideological core of Vaporwave 
now sounds familiar, that’s 
because it is. Both movements 
were brought about by critical 
minds observing the society 
in which they lived, both are 
viciously 
anti-consumerist, 
and both serve as a cultural 
snapshot of a generation.
While it may be jumping 
the gun to assign the same 
level of cultural significance 
to Vaporwave as one would 
to 
Dada, 
the 
ideological 
and conceptual similarities 
between the two movements 
are 
striking. 
Vaporwave’s 
circulation 
as 
an 
internet 
meme adds an entirely new 
facet to the discussion, as 
the cultural clout of memes 
in the context of the arts has 
yet to be formally established. 
While it may be tempting 
to dismiss the significance 
of memes due to their often 
ridiculous nature, one could 
also view the medium as a 
unique form of sharing ideas, 
one that no prior generation 
has used. Only time will tell 
where Vaporwave lands in 
our cultural lexicon, but until 
then artists like Vektroid will 
keep on cruising down the 
sonic highways of yesteryear.

Whatever 
someone 
may 
think 
about 
his 
humor, 
a 
person’s reaction to an episode 
of “The Eric Andre Show” is a 
surprisingly effective way to 
gauge their personality. I won’t 
quite go so far as to judge you 
based on your reaction, but I 
can, in a way that’s difficult 
to articulate, get to know you 
beyond 
a 
superficial 
level 
(although I will say if you 
guffaw the same way I do after 
watching a specific segment for 
the 10th time, we will probably 
be friends). Borrowing from 
a rich tradition of absurdist 
humor ranging from Monty 
Python to “Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern are Dead,” Eric 
Andre’s work is the most 
successful form of absurdism 
in the internet and pop culture 
age.
There is a wealth of options 
for the discerning late-night 
viewer. Too many options, 
really. While each variation 
of the format has their own 
unique 
“made-for-Youtube” 
segments, they are really all 
too similar. The tropes of 
straight white men making 
just barely witty jokes, offering 

milquetoast interviews with 
celebrities who would rather be 
anywhere else and squandering 
opportunities 
with 
actually 
interesting guests make for 
a steady stream of cash for 
networks, but offer little in the 
way of substance 
for 
viewers. 
Every once in a 
while, you might 
just 
become 
completely 
fed 
up with the self-
importance of it 
all.
Enter 
Eric 
Andre. 
Perhaps 
the best way to 
describe 
“The 
Eric 
Andre 
Show” 
is 
a 
deconstruction 
of 
this 
tired 
format. It’s like 
watching Jimmy 
Kimmel, 
except 
you just flipped 
on the new TV in 
the Red Room in 
“Twin Peaks” while tripping 
on acid. It lies in an uncanny 
valley of late night talk shows. 
For the first five seconds or 
so, everything seems normal. 
Eric 
Andre 
himself 
seems 
charming 
enough, 
sitting 
behind a desk holding note 
cards. There’s a live band. The 

audience is clapping (well, kind 
of). There’s the straight man 
played by Hannibal Buress who 
seems funny enough to riff off 
the host’s jokes. So far, so good.
And usually, it all falls 
apart in a glorious, symphonic 
trainwreck. 
Every 
single 
aspect 
of 
the 
show 
is 
designed 
to 
make 
the 
guest 
as 
uncomfortable 
as possible. At 
this point, there 
are either two 
reactions: 
You 
either feel as 
uncomfortable 
as the guest, or 
you decide that 
this is the best 
thing you have 
ever 
watched. 
Reportedly, 
the studio has 
a 
conspicuous 
lack 
of 
air 
conditioning. There might be 
a musky smell permeating the 
place as well, or even “heat 
ducts in (the guest’s) seats.” 
Andre 
might 
strip 
naked, 
puke over his desk or suspend 
a man with hooks over the 
desk — whatever it takes to 
completely horrify the guests. 

Even Hannibal is in tune with 
him, whether he is shouting at 
Christina Applegate or getting 
verbally assaulted by a woman 
from the crowd (before getting 
slapped by said woman’s wig).
For 
the 
most 
part, 
the 
guests seem to end the show 
contemplating 
firing 
their 
publicists. Unlike the usual 
round of late night shows, 
guests are never coddled or 
worshipped. 
It 
makes 
you 
wonder what exactly would 
happen if some of the truly 
repulsive 
figures 
who 
end 
up on the normal talk shows 
appeared with Eric Andre (à 
la Sacha Baron Cohen in “Who 
is America”). But every once 
in a while, a Tyler the Creator 
shows up — that is, someone 
who 
understands, 
embraces 
and completely flips the shows 
format on its head, reducing 
Andre to be more akin to 
Jimmy Fallon than his usual, 
irreverent self.
But 
maybe 
the 
true 
brilliance of the show is that 
I am completely wrong. There 
may be no method whatsoever 
to Eric Andre’s madness, and 
if so, more power to him. I just 
hope that in a world where 
reality seems just as absurd 
as the wildest fictions ever 
conceived, he can find ways to 
continue shocking us.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

You are about to begin 
reading 
the 
latest 
edition 
of the B-Side on absurd art. 
Or, depending on the layout, 
maybe this is the last article 
you came across. At the time 
this article was written, it was 
only a flood of pixels, one trip 
down the waterfall of edits 
away from print. The author 
was aware that according to 
convention, usually the lead 
article reigns supreme from 
the upper left of the first 
page. 
Nonsense 
like 
what 
you 
are 
currently 
reading 
would be lucky to be shuffled 
between 
the 
intermediary 
pages. The author still leaves 
the possibility open for you 
to fatally flip to page three 
on your first read. It is also 
possible that the chiefest of 
nonsense 
takes 
precedence 
in an insert dedicated to 
nonsense.
Take a moment to take 
in your surroundings. The 
classroom chatter is enough 
to 
slightly 
obstruct, 
forcing you to 
make a choice: 
Finish reading 
this 
article 
or 
prepare 
yourself 
for 
class with the 
one 
minute 
you have left. 
You 
opt 
for 
the 
latter 
(a 
smart decision, 
as 
reading 
a 
crinkly 
newspaper 
is 
complicated 
to do covertly) 
and 
your 
professor 
suddenly 
manifests into 
the 
cramped, 
windowless 
room. 
How, 
you 
ask? 
Your 
questions 
remained 
unanswered as the lights dim 
and the projector whirs.
“I have eaten the plums” 
is all you can make out. You 
crane your neck around the six 
feet of human in front of you to 
read the text that has spilled 
onto the blackboard. It seems 
orientation has been thrown 
out the window. But there is no 
window, thankfully, because if 
there was a window, the birds 
would sing tempting songs 
of 
self-defenestration 
from 
their unimpeded pedestals. 
You, the prisoner pawn, sit 
flanked 
by 
that 
unusually 
tall bishop and fellow fodder, 
while the opposing queen plots 
unflinchingly.
The 
invisible 
hands 
controlling the standoff begin 
to budge, albeit apathetically. 
The 
presentation 
on 
the 
absence of convention and form 
in literature switches slides 
slowly in the background. 
You find it funny that this 
theoretical warden has the 
gall to confine you when they 
have 
never 
been 
confined 
themselves. 
Intrinsically, 
they are free. You are not. 
Your professor, the eightfold 
master of the checkerboard, 
initiates her strike. Ramble of 
how abandoning form is form 
itself soundtracks this scheme. 
Fell swoop. 12:51. You and your 
monochromatic 
compatriots 
lay prostrate on the battlefield 
of irony.
This article has become 
crumpled 
in 
your 
hurried 
attempts to fashion the insert 
back to its virginal state. 
You put all your focus into 
these words. Except the only 
words that can excite you are 
“RESTROOMS.” The helpful 
arrow indicating their position 
extends seemingly infinitely. 
The stall door flies open as 
fast as your belt unbuckles. 
You think to yourself that The 
Thinker looks like he’s shitting 
and 
everything 
amusingly 
swirls 
together. 
Lecture 
keywords buzz through your 
mind, but where to store them 
provides a challenge.

With a clear mind and

for your sweet midday nap. You 
are at peace. Instantaneously, 
your meditative state of mind 
is marred when 
an ugly stack of

greets 
your arrival. You 
angrily 
ponder 
the notion that 
your

actually believes 
you don’t need

to 
clean 
pans. 
Boiling 
like a tea kettle, 
steam billows out 
of your ears quite 
cartoonishly. 
You need to cool 
in the calming 
waters of your 
most 
cherished 
story, 
“Pierre 
Menard, Author 
of the Quixote.”
The 
author 
wonders why you, 
someone 
who 
prefers chess-fueled escapism 
over English class, would have 
a leather-bound copy of “The 
Garden of Forking Paths.” 
You and the author share a 
common 
bond: 
Questions 
remain unanswered.
Perhaps you like reading 
books that aren’t really books 
and don’t like listening to 
people talk about books that 
aren’t really books. You hate 
structure anyways, evidenced 
by the fact “Pale Fire” and 
“Hopscotch” top the pile of 
books sandwiched in a corner. 
You prefer function over form; 
functionally, the corner is a 
bookshelf.
Chapters 
and 
three-
act structure are tools of 
oppression. 
Liberation, 
in 
your eyes, is the shirking of 
oppression. In absurdity, you 
find normality.
You 
realize 
that 
Jorge 
Luis Borges found normality 
in absurdity as well. So did 
Vladimir 
Nabokov. 
Julio 
Cortázar. 
William 
Carlos 
Williams. In your attempt to 
subvert normality, a new norm 
was established. The walls of 
your room are closing in. In 
a flurry of motion, you grab 
your copy of Italo Calvino’s “If 
on a winter’s night a traveler” 
from the middle of your stack, 
an absurd stack, as infinite as 
the Library of Babel housed in 
that aforementioned favorite 
leather tome of yours. The 
balance is upset and its weight 
is enough to crush you, if not 
for your nimbleness. The world 
around you is vanishing, like 
the letters on the last page of 
that Calvino book you grabbed 
after you spilled water on it.
It takes the first word of 
“traveler” to realize that your 
shackles are drawn in ink. 
You are bound to this page of 
the B-Side as you were bound 
to the classroom. You are the 
reader. I am the author. While 
these pages are set in type, 
the nature of our relationship 
is not. Perhaps one day these 
roles will be reversed. For 
now, you’re still fiddling with 
this flimsy paper. Classmates 
chatter 
closely. 
The 
clock 
strikes noon.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘ELECTRICITY’

“Electricity”

Dua Lipa

Warner Bros.

Somehow, 
we 
as 
a collective have not 
dropped 
Dua 
Lipa 
quite yet.
The English singer/
songwriter first rose 
to 
attention 
with 
“New Rules,” a driving 
pop anthem that was 

made distinct by Dua 
Lipa’s curiously husky, 
soulful voice. From 
there, she remained 
steady, always existing 
within the public eye 
with consistent music 
releases — like her “One 
Kiss” 
collaboration 

with Calvin Harris — 
but never reaching the 
same level of attention 
as she did with “New 
Rules.”
In a similar sense, 
her 
newest 
single, 
“Electricity,” 
doesn’t 
veer far from her norm. 

Teaming up with Silk City — a 
music duo consisting of Mark 
Ronson and Diplo — she has 
created what was created with 
“One Kiss,” and what could be 
argued was created with “New 
Rules”: a dancefloor smash hit, 
and nothing more.
With Lipa’s vocals layered 
over 
Silk 
City’s 
predictable 
pop algorithm, “Electricity” is 
unsurprising, yet not terrible. 
It does what it’s meant to 
accomplish. The tempo is fast 
enough to make your hips start 
swaying of their own accord. The 
piano interspersed throughout 
the song adds an effervescent 
quality to contrived house beats. 
The lyrics, “I wanted to let you 
know, I’ll never let this feeling 
go” are just catchy enough to 
scream in the middle of Rick’s, 
the pulsating bodies all around 
adding to the electricity of the 
song itself.
It does its job well and with 
that, I guess Dua Lipa is sticking 
around for a little bit longer.
