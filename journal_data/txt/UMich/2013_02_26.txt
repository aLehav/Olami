Interim University
policy obligates
employees to act
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily NewsEditor
A University employee has
reported that a student told her
that she was sexually assaulted
after attending aparty on Feb. 15,
according to University Police.
The incident was reported to
UMPD at 12:10 p.m. Thursday, six
days after the night of the alleged
assault. At the time of the report,
the location of the alleged sexual
assault was unknown. UMPD
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
investigators determined that the
assault took place off campus.
The UMPD incident log shows
that the case was closed Sat-
urday. Brown said there was
no report filed for the assault
because the victim asked police
to not investigate the incident
any further.
Brown said the police are still
looking into the report to see if
there is a threat to the commu-
nity, in which case the depart-
ment would release a crime
alert.
The assault would be the third

sexual assault reported by police
this semester.
WEST QUAD RAPE
SUSPECT YET TO BE
ARRAIGNED
The student arrested for the
Jan. 13 rape that was reported in
West Quad Residence Hall still
has not been arraigned, Brown
said Monday.
The suspect, who allegedly
raped the victim after walking
to West Quad following an off-
campus party, was arrested in
January after a tip led to the sus-
pect. The student was charged
and released pending warrant
authorization.
Brownsaiditislikelythestudent
has not yet been arraigned because
the crime lab is still processing evi-
dence. The lab must analyze anum-
ber of tests, which could take up to
severalmonthsto process.
Evidence will be sent to the
Washtenaw County Prosecuting
Attorney's Office to determine if
chargeswill be levied against the
student.
The University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center
is open Monday through Friday
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Michigan
Union. It also offers a 24-hour cri-
sis line at (734) 936-3333.

Students build site
to promote Motor
City internships
By WILL GREENBERG
For the Daily
Art & Design sophomore Matt
Rosner and his friends want to
change perceptions on campus
about Detroit and inform Uni-
versity students that there's
more to the city than date par-

ties and community service.
Rosner is the head creator
of Detroit Wolverine, a web-
site linking Detroit-based com-
panies with the University to
increase access to internships.
Rosner said he was looking to
involve students in an innova-
tive way with the culture of the
city.
"The goal of the organiza-
tion was to engage with Detroit
and the University in a way that
hadn't been done before," Ros-
ner said. "Most of those orga-

nizations (already involved in
Detroit) did community service
or service-geared learning... but
when we collected together and
talked about it, it's not some-
thing we wanted to engage in."
Detroit Wolverine works on a
rolling basis, uploading links to
companies' internship applica-
tions as companies join the pro-
gram. There are various types of
positions offered, both paid and
unpaid, and all from companies
within the Detroit area.
Rosner said he sees intern-

ships as just one part of a "multi-
angled approach" to get students
more excited and engaged about
Detroit.
"When you mention Detroit
the word association is either
crime or sports, and that's
about it," Rosner said, "There's
a lot of really cool stuff that not
many people know about in Ann
Arbor, whether they're from the
metro Detroit (area) or they're
from across the nation."

UMHS doctors
make list of top
U.S. physicians

550 listed as
best in the nation in
their specialties
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily Staff Reporter
On the heels of a previous dis-
tinction, 505 individual Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System
doctors were named to the 2012-
13 Best Doctors in America list.
UMHS is the most represented
institution on the list, which puts
the physicians in the top-five per-
cent nationwide for their special-
ties. The UMHS physicians on
the list have increased about 16
percent from 433 when it was last
compiled two years ago by the
Boston-based Best Doctors.
The list contains more than
45,000 physicians in 40 specialties
who were selected on the basis of
peer nominations by specialty and
surveys regarding their specific
practices and patient satisfaction.
Though the awards were indi-
vidual, Internal Medicine Prof.
Kim Eagle, director of the UMHS
Cardiovascular Center, said he
believes the award strengthens
the reputation and morale of the
University as a whole.

"The University has a lot of
people named to this list year
afteryear,andI'mpleasedthatwe
have so many physicians achiev-
ing that standard," Eagle said.
"I'm very fortunate that I work in
an institution where excellence in
clinical care, research, and edu-
cation are basically expected."
Eagle also believes that mak-
ing these lists, though they are
subjective bynature, is "integral"
in continuing to develop the next
generation of physicians.
"As doctors, we seek recogni-
tion indirectly," Eagle said. "You
want your work to speak for
itself, but in aspiring to be the
best and achieving this caliber
of recognition in all divisions, it's
important to remember you're
only as good as your last patient."
Prof. Teresa Jacobs, director
of the Neurological Intensive
Care Unit, said she was notified
last week that she had achieved
recognition for the second time.
Because Jacobs works with
patients in the NICU, she said
she doesn't foresee that this dis-
tinction will have a major effect
on her clinical practice, but that
could be the case for doctors who
do more outpatient care.

dent Government elections -
nominated Business and LSA
junior Michael Proppe and LSA

sophomore Bobby Dishell as its
presidential and vice presiden-
tial candidates, respectively.
The pair will join candidates

AALL TIED UP

Bringing Uganda to Ann Arbor

Robert Wyrod is an assistant
professor in the Women's Studies
Department and has focused his
academic career in sociological
research on gender and sexuality
in the developing world, specifical-
ly Uganda. He graduated from the
University in 1989 with a degree in
cellular and molecular biology and
received his doctorate in sociology
from the University of Chicago in
2007.
What classes are you teach-
ing this semester?
I teach a large lecture course
on the global AIDS epidemic, and
I teach just a really small seminar
for juniors who are going to do an

honors thesis their senior year. the students in my AIDS class.

If you could teach any class
at the University, what class
would you teach?
I have to say that I really like
the global AIDS epidemic course
I'm teaching right now. It's nice
because it builds on my research
experience, but it also draws on
my undergraduate education in
the sciences. It gives me a chance
to bring together science issues,
social science issues and stuff
surrounding arts and culture. It's
a pretty neat class, and it's really
challenging because you don't
feel like you're an expert in any-
thing. I've been really happy with

Can you tell me a little bit
about your research?
I'm a sociologist. I do eth-
nographic or anthropological
research in Uganda. I've spent
about a year and a half doing
fieldwork in one slum community
in the capital, Kampala, and I've
been looking at how conceptions
of masculinity in this community
are changing in relation to the
AIDS epidemic, so whether or not
the AIDS epidemic has made peo-
ple think any differently about
what it means to be a man in this
African context.

British cardinal will skip
upcoming papal conclave

Syria gov't says it's prepared to
hold talks with opposition

Britain's highest-
ranking Catholic
leader recuses himself
VATICAN CITY (AP) - In a
season of startling change for
the Catholic Church, the lat-
est break with tradition was as
unexpected as it was a wake-
up call to the 115 men who will
elect the next pope.
Britain's highest-ranking

Catholic leader resigned and
removed himself Monday from
the upcoming conclave, saying
he did not want allegations that
he engaged in improper conduct
with priests to be a distraction
during the solemn process of
choosing the next leader of the
church's 1.2 billion-member
flock.
It was the first time a cardi-
nal has recused himself from a
conclave because of personal
scandal, according to Vatican

historians.
The Vatican insisted that
Pope Benedict XVI accepted
Cardinal Keith O'Brien's resig-
nation purely because O'Brien
was nearing the retirement age
of 75 - not because of the accu-
sations.
But O'Brien himself issued
a statement Monday saying he
would skip the conclave because
he wanted to avoid becoming
the focus of media attention at
such a delicate time.
"I do not wish media atten-


IOt I MI4Nk t l 1th I R IA5IM I H M I LAMLUIU' tion in Rome to be focused on
me - but rather on Pope Bene-
BEST ORE? dict XVI and on his successor,"
BES 'UB? said O'Brien, who had been
archbishop of St. Andrews and
iEST .. i BAR Edinburgh. "However, I will
pray with them and for them
kEST ORE- that, enlightened by the Holy
lEST ' /"4BESi Spirit, they will make the cor-
rect choice for the future good
IZZA ~ BESi of the church."
Through his spokesman,
AIR AST? O'Brien has contested allega-
~ lions made Sunday in a British
newspaper that three priests
.1i FS A t omionts tod e ain alleg-sh
and a former priest had filed
complaints to the Vatican alleg-
ing that the cardinal acted inap-
propriately with them.
There were no details about
the behavior, and the Observer
8 9 newspaper did not name the
priests. It said the allegations
71date back to the 1980s.
The cardinal's action comes
in the wake of a grassroots
campaign to shame another
cardinal, retired Los Angeles
Cardinal Roger Mahony, into
refraining from participating
1 3 7 2 9 because of his role protecting
sexually abusive priests.
Mahony, however, has defi-
5 2 4 antly said he would participate
in the voting for the new pope.
4 7 3 1 6 The difference boils down
to the fact that O'Brien him-
self was accused of improper
behavior, whereas Mahony was
shown to have covered up for
8 other priests who raped and
molested children.
'SThat distinction has long
shielded bishops from Vatican
sanction.

Armed rebel groups
halt boycott on Rome
political conference
BEIRUT (AP) - Syria said
Monday it is prepared to hold
talks with armed rebels bent on
overthrowing President Bashar
Assad, the clearest signal yet that
the regime is growing increas-
ingly nervous about its long-term
prospects to hold onto power as
opposition fighters make slow but
persistent headway in the civil
war.
Meanwhile, the umbrella
group for Syrian opposition par-
ties said it had reversed a deci-
sion to boycott a conference in
Rome being held to help drum up
financial and political support for
the opposition. Walid al-Bunni, a
spokesman for the Syrian Nation-
al Coalition, said the move came
after a phone call between the
group's leader, Mouaz al-Khatib,
and U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry.
Al-Bunni told pan-Arab broad-
caster Al-Arabiya the decision
was made based on guarantees
al-Khatib heard from Western
diplomats that the conference
would be different this time. He
did not elaborate. The boycott
had put the group at odds with its
international backers.
The Syrian talks offer, made
by Foreign Minister Walid al-
Moallem during a visit to Mos-
cow, came hours before residents
of Damascus and state-run TV
reported a huge explosion and a
series of smaller blasts in the cap-
ital, followed by heavy gunfire.
State-run news agency SANA
said there were multiple casual-
ties from the explosion, which it
said was a suicide car bombing.
Britain-based activist group the
Syrian Observatory for Human
Rights said the explosions tar-
geted a checkpoint, adding there
were initial reports of at least five
regime forces killed and several
wounded.
The talks proposal marked
the first time that a high-ranking

regime official has stated publicly
that Damascus would be willing
to meet with the armed opposi-
tion. But al-Moallem did not spell
out whether rebels would first
have to lay down their weapons
before negotiations could begin- a
crucial sticking point in the past.
The regime's offer is unlikely
to lead to talks. The rebels bat-
tling the Syrian military have
vowedto stop atnothingless than
Assad's downfall and are unlikely
to agree to sit down with a leader
they accuse of mass atrocities.
But the timing of the proposal
suggests the regime is warm-
ing to the idea of a settlement as
it struggles to hold territory and
claw back ground it has lost to
the rebels in the nearly 2-year-
old conflict.
Opposition fighters have
scored several tactical victories
in recent weeks, capturing the
nation's largest hydroelectric
dam and overtaking air bases
in the northeast. In Damascus,
they have advanced from their
strongholds in the suburbs into
neighborhoods in the northeast
and southern rim of the capital,
while peppering the center of the
city with mortar rounds for days.
Monday night's explosion
struck about 800 meters (yards)
from Abbasid Square, alandmark
plaza in central Damascus. It was
followed by several other smaller
blasts thought to be mortar shells
landing in various districts of
the capital. The explosions and
subsequent gunfire caused panic
among residents who hid in their
apartments.
On Thursday, a car bomb near
the ruling Baath Party headquar-
ters in Damascus killed at least 53
people, according to state media.
While the momentum appears
to be shifting in the rebels' direc-
tion, the regime's grip on Damas-
cus remains firm, and Assad's fall
is far from imminent.
Still, Monday's offer to nego-
tiate with the armed opposition
- those whom Assad referred to
only in January as "murderous
criminals" and refused to talk
with - reflects the regime's real-

ization that in the long run, its
chances of keeping its grip on
power are slim.
Asked about al-Moallem's
remarks, U.S. State Department
spokesman Patrick Ventrell said
the offer of talks was a positive
step "in the context of them rain-
ing Scuds down on their own
civilians." But he expressed cau-
tion about the seriousness of the
offer.
"I don't know their motiva-
tions, other than to say they
continue to rain down horrific
attacks on their own people,"
Ventrell told reporters in Wash-
ington. "So that speaks pretty
loudly and clearly."
If the Assad regime is serious,
he said, it should inform the U.N.
peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi of
its readiness for talks. Ventrell
said the regime hasn't done that
yet.
Andrew Tabler, a fellow at the
Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, called the offer "a
sign of weakness."
"I think everybody knows,
including Bashar Assad, that they
(the regime) can't hang onto the
whole country," Tabler said.
Mustafa Alani, an analyst
with the Gulf Research Center
in Geneva, said the regime has
"reached the conclusion that
they are heading toward a major
defeat eventually, and this is the
right time to negotiate."
"They are not losing miles
every day, but they are losing
substantial ground every day. So
the regime is not genuine (in its
offer) because it has changed, it's
genuine because it is responding
to a major shift in the balance of
power on the ground," he added.
Alani cautioned, however, that
the regime is also eager to keep
the idea of talks alive in order to
forestall any Western decision
on arming the rebels. As long as
the possibility of negotiations is
still on the table, the U.S. and the
European Union - which have so
far provided only non-lethal aid -
will be reluctant to open the flood
gates on weapons for the opposi-
tion, he said.

Feds to probe Ford
cars for stalling
The National Highway Traf-

The probe affects Ford Escape

The vehicles can unexpect-

Italy faces political
gridlock after
crucial election
The prospect of political paral-

as near complete official results
in crucial elections showed -an
upstart protest campaign led by
a comedian making stunning
inroads, and mainstream forces
of center-left and center-right
wrestling for control of Parlia-

The story of the election in the
eurozone's third largest economy
was shaping up to be the aston-
ishing vote haul of comic-turned-

whose 5 Star Movement has capi-
talized on a wave of voter disgust
with the ruling political class.
Another surprise has been the
return as a political force of bil-
lionaire media mogul Silvio Ber-
lusconi, who was forced from the
premiership at the end of 2011
by Italy's debt crisis, and whose
forces now had a strong chance

impact the environment around
you in the city and the citizens
around you is quite low," Ros-
ner said. "The interesting thing
about Detroit is because the
innovation happening in the
city is only just recently start-
ing to reboot itself, the ability
for someone to make an impact
in the community or within a
sector of business in the city is
highlylikely."
Rosner said he was "infatu-
ated with the culture" of Detroit
and worries that a combination
of fear and ignorance is prevent-
ing students from experiencing
the city.
"Don't get me wrong, the city
is still dangerous, and there's
cities all around the world that
are dangerous, and so it's not

like the negative stigmas aren't
true, but there's a lot between
the lines that exists that's really
exciting," Rosner said.
LSA junior Morgan Princing,
a co-creator of Detroit Wolver-
ine, participated in the Semester
in Detroit program last spring
and plans to return again this
summer. She agreed that stu-
dents' fears about Detroit may
be too harsh.
"It's just more or less like
another city, and you have to be,
you know, safe as you are any-
where," Princing said, "I wasby
no means discouraged by it."
Both Princing and Rosner
said the benefits of working in
Detroit far outweigh the risks,
and they encourage students to
get involved in the city as much
as possible.
"Detroit just has a lot of per-
sonality, and I think there's a
lot of ways that Detroit kind of
inspires people," Princing said.
"The whole do-it-yourself cul-
ture can be very inspiring."
In the future, Detroit Wolver-
ine wants to partner with other
Detroit-focused groups on cam-
pus to increase access to the city
for the students. Specific goals
include a Detroit internship fair,
increased transportation to the
city and "Friday Nights in the D"
weekend outings.

The party's goal is to create a
collaborative environment.
While increasing student con-
nectivity seems like an abstract
idea, Dishell said a tangible
solution is creating a leader-
ship network that would aim to
bring student leaders together
for issues and events and regular
meetings.
"This leadership network
would be able to collaborate,"
Dishell said. "This leadership
network would be able to sup-
port each other, and it would be
able to spread the information,
so campus in a year is going to
be a much more interconnected
campus."
Another goal of youMICH is
to continue the entrepreneur-
ial mindset of the current CSG
administration. In particular,
Proppe said youMICH would
like to introduce an entrepre-
neurship learning community.
LSA junior Laurel Ruza said
other platform promises include
an MCard app for students'
smartphones, a 24-hour caf on
North Campus, and a survey that
incoming students would take at
orientation to connect them to

LEAD currently supports 127

Coleman said the program
also increases the success of

dents, better matching efforts

ment.
"We also need to be able to

If youMICH were to lose the

the party would still look to
enact part of its platform.
"As party chair I look to our

representatives," Ruza said. "If
we get some of our representa-
tives - hopefully all of our rep-
resentatives in CSG next year
- they'll be able to fulfill some of
our goals."
Ruza said youMICH wants to
see that its representative candi-
dates have their own goals, too.
Proppe boasts his experience
as speaker of the assembly.
"Now I'm ready to take that
experience that I've had in the

Proppe said. "Just seeing the
process of writing a resolution
getting this through and then
carrying out the actions of that
resolution is something that I
don't think a lot of people get to
see within CSG."
Proppe added that he plans
to use his experience to better
engage assembly representatives.

nal voice outside the Univer-

said.
SACUA member Rachel Gold-
man, an engineering and phys-
ics professor, asked Coleman if
BLM is interested in drawing
investment for higher educa-
tion in general or specific fields
after hearing a claim that there
is a corporate interest in creat-
ing more engineering schools in
the state.
Coleman said support for
higher education transcends
engineering and covers all
fields of education.
"There have been a lot of
concerns nationally for sci-
ence, technology, engineer-
ing and math ... (but) business
leaders, in my opinion, have
felt that a higher education
investment is a good education
investment in all fields, not
narrowing the focus at all,"
Coleman said. "There is some
evidence that suggests that
students (who study liberal
arts) will form critical skills
that they will be very success-
ful as leaders."
Coleman also said diversity
in education should be valued
and sought after in a quickly
globalizing and interdisciplin-
ary world and academic envi-
ronment.
"We want to teach students
that regardless of discipline,

how do you think?" she said.
"How do you solve problems?

working on or upcoming issues.
Proppe said representatives are
"underutilized" in these projects
and issues.
"You need to be proactive
in approaching reps," Proppe
said. "I think the assembly loves
seeing the reps take charge on
these sorts of things so giving
them more opportunities to take
charge on these sorts of things
can go along way."
Proppe had actually not con-
sidered running for the position
prior to accepting the nomina-
tion.
"I had initially expressed that
I was not interested in the posi-
tion," Proppe said. "I wanted to
continue to play a role in CSG
next year, but I wasn't sure what
that would be."
Proppe added that he felt com-
pelled to run after he failed to see
a "platform that resonated with
what I wanted to accomplish."
"I started to reconsider and,
after chatting with aslot of other
people, I'm really excited to be
doing this and I wish I had made
the decision earlier," he said.

you gain and use it to work on
a real world problem? And that
involves many disciplines, not
just one."
After Coleman left the meet-
ing, the committee discussed
faculty retention within the
University, and Hanlon said
in the last academic year, the
amount of faculty solicited by
other universities grew for the
third consecutive year. Over
the past five or six years, the
University won about 61 per-
cent of cases, but over the past
year won only 54 percent of the
cases.
Biology Prof. John Lehman
asked Hanlon and Coleman
about future advancement in
the University's online course
offerings.
Hanlon said new mod-
ules are going to change the
way the University teaches
by allowing for more active
engagement with students,
more student collaboration
and a deeper understanding of
how students learn most effi-
ciently.
"My dad was a country doc-
tor (and) he had almost no tech-
nology," Hanlon said. "I feel
like in the teaching space we
are back where my dad was, if
you want to know whether a
student is learning or not, you

look at them and try and figure
out that dear in the headlights
look ... I think we are looking at
a future where we can use tech-
nology to see how students are
learning."

Attorney says BP
ignored safety
for profit
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - BP
put profits ahead of safety and
bears most of the blame for
the disastrous 2010 spill in the
Gulf of Mexico, a U.S. Justice
Department attorney charged
Monday at the opening of a
trial that could result in the oil
company and its partners being
forced to pay tens of billions of
dollars more in damages.
The London-based oil giant
acknowledged it made "errors
in judgment" before the deadly
blowout, but it also cast blame
on the owner of the drilling rig
and the contractor involved in
cementing the well. It denied
it was grossly negligent, as the
government contended.
Thehigh-stakescivilcasewent
to trial after attempts to reach an
11th-hour settlement failed.
Eleven workers were killed
when the Deepwater Horizon
rig leased by the BP exploded
on April 20, 2010. An estimated
172 millions of gallons of crude
gushed into the Gulf over the
three months that followed in
the worst offshore oil spill in
U.S. history.
Justice Department attorney
Mike Underhill said the catas-
trophe resulted from BP's "cul-
ture of corporate recklessness."
"The evidence will show that
BP put profits before people,
profits before safety and profits
before the environment," Under-

hill said in opening statements.
He added: "Despite BP's attempts
to shifttheblametoother parties,
by far the primary fault for this
disasterbelongs to BP."
BP attorney Mike Brock
acknowledged that the oil com-
pany made mistakes. But he
accused rig owner Transocean
Ltd. of failing to properly main-
tain the rig's blowout preventer,
which had a dead battery, and
he claimed cement contractor
Halliburton used a "bad slurry"
that failed to prevent oil and gas
from travelingup the well.
BP has already pleaded
guilty to manslaughter and
other criminal charges and has
racked up more than $24 bil-
lion in spill-related expenses,
including cleanup costs, com-
pensation for businesses and
individuals, and $4 billion in
criminal penalties.
But the federal government,
Gulf Coast states and individu-
als and businesses hope to con-
vince a federal judge that the
company and its partners in the
ill-fated drilling project are liable
for much more in civil damages
under the Clean Water Act and
other environmental regulations.
One of the biggest questions
facing U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier, who is hearing the case
without a jury, is whether BP
acted with gross negligence.
Under the Clean Water Act,
a polluter can be forced to pay a
minimum of $1,100 per barrel of
spilled oil; the fines nearly qua-
druple to about $4,300 a barrel
for companies found grossly neg-
ligent, meaning BP could be on
the hook for nearly $18 billion.

Juvenile, but harmless
Controversy surrounding Pike pictures misses the point
Last week, the University's chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity,
often called Pike, garnered worldwide headlines after photos
were spread of its members posing semi-nude with American
flags. The photos, part of a party invitation to a sorority, were accom-
panied by an e-mail stating that Pike "paddles pledges because it's a
comprehensive upper body workout." After the media got a hold of the
photos and letter, the Pike national chapter ordered a 15-day suspen-
sion of the fraternity. What Pike did was juvenile; however, this pub-
licized incident is laughably tame compared to serious offenses that
have surrounded Greek life and campuses at large, and is receiving

tives, diuretics

dents became

conscious after ZO
starting college. STAHL
And 27.8 percent
of female under-
graduates and 11.8 percent of male
undergraduates screened positive
for eating disorders. I could go
on, but the remaining figures -
which are consistently higher than
the last study in 2008 - paint an
equally grim picture.
These are the preliminary results
from the University Study of Habits,
Attitudes and Perceptions around
Eating. In October 2012, researchers
from the University collaborated on
U-SHAPE with Ann Arbor's Center
for Eating Disorders, surveying the
University student body "to under-
stand students' habits, attitudes, and
perceptions around eating, dieting,
exercising and body image and how
these fit into a larger picture of stu-
dent well-being."
The researchers attribute these
high rates to the University students'
competitive nature. And the study
offers other clues too: On average,
students considered hook-up culture
and Greek life to negatively influence
their eating habits and body image.
However, I think there's another
issue at hand: anti-fat prejudice.
I know that makingcausal claims
about the relationship between fat

discrimination and eating disor-
ders is tricky. However, with more
than half of the student body con-
ceding, "I would like myself more
if I were thinner" and with 90 per-
cent of female students and 55 per-
cent of male students worried about
gaining the "Freshman 15," it's hard
to deny there's a fear of getting fat.
This study, along with many oth-
ers, reveals how detrimental this
fear truly is. In a recent article
from The Washington Post, Abigail
Saguy, a sociology professor at the
University of California, Los Ange-
les, argues that "Anti-fat prejudice
harms average-size and thin people
... as the fear of becoming fat drives
many of them to develop eating dis-
orders and body-image problems."
And even more, this anti-fat prej-
udice harms those considered over-
weight or obese. Though research
has shown that obesity is a chronic
disease caused by a combination of
one's genes and their environment,
many consider the obese to be lazy
and self-indulgent. This stereotype
has many negative consequences.
Many health professionals practice
size-profiling - or attributing a
patient's ailments to weight - and
thus fail to provide the adequate
care. Not only are there medical
consequences, but there are also
emotional ones. Studies reveal
that the obese routinely experi-
ence insulting and dismissive treat-
ment when shopping and that obese
women receive lower wages than
equally qualified, thinner women.
This isn't to say there aren't
health risks associated with obesity
- for example, as weight increases
so does the likelihood of develop-
ing Type 2 diabetes. But there are
also negative health consequenc-

es associated with being average
weight. For example, a study at the
Center for Disease Control and the
National Institutes of Health found
that adults considered overweight
or obese had a lower mortality risk
than average-weight individuals,
showing that weight is not always
proxy for personal well-being.
The results of
U-SHAPE are
cause for a
new attitude.
So, what's the point in citing all
of these statistics and studies?
It's to say that using weight as
a stand-in for health is a slippery
slope. And discrimination of the
obese can be just as detrimental to
society's physical and emotional
health as obesity itself. With this
in mind, I think we ought to listen
to Judith Banker, principal inves-
tigator of the U-SHAPE study,
when she encourages "students (to)
become activists on a very personal
level by avoiding diet and weight
talk ... The collective power of such
individual actions can't be under-
estimated. Imagine if everyone on
campus stopped talking about feel-
ing fat or pointing out fat people
or stopped talking about what diet
they were on or should be on."
I can already hear the collective
sigh of relief.

undue attention.
Compared to other fraternity actions, Pike's
photo stunt was rather innocuous - perhaps
nothing more than a future regret for the flag-
draped members. Recently, Duke University's
chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity hosted
an Asian-theme party, leading to student pro-
tests against the so-called "racist rager." The
fraternity was later suspended from campus,
but according to Larry Moneta, the university's
vice president of student affairs, the suspen-
sion "had nothing to do with the Asian-theme
party." Such parties create uncomfortable
campus environments for students - arguably
more so than boys covered in American flags -
and yet, universities and nationwide fraternity
organizations have refused to openly punish
fraternities for these tasteless transgressions.
Beyond offensive parties, the handling of
these Greek life incidences have been a con-
troversy in and of itself. While the Pike invi-
tation received worldwide attention, inciting
debates on everything from sexist language
in the e-mail to questions of disrespecting the
American flag, more threatening incidents
haven't received nearly as much attention. In
an Rolling Stone article, Dartmouth College's
chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon was accused
of extreme hazing practices including forcing
pledges to eat vomeletes (vomit omelets), swim
in kiddie pools of semen, urine and other bodi-
ly waste and of course, binge drinking. Later,
the college's Undergraduate Judicial Affairs
Committee dropped all 27 charges held against

the fraternity. Though the body concluded
that there was insufficient evidence to punish
the fraternity, the hazing surrounding many
fraternities makes it difficult for members to
speak up against these horrific behaviors, with
many either silencing themselves or, in the
case of Andrew Lohse, a Dartmouth student
interviewed by Rolling Stone, being ostracized
by fellow fraternity brothers.
Unfortunately, many universities choose to
deal with these grave issues not through inter-
nal problem solving, but by disassociating the
fraternity from the campus community entire-
ly. After reports of hazing surfaced in March
2011, the Interfraternity Council removed the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the Univer-
sity of its campus affiliation. Nevertheless, the
fraternity is now able to recruit members each
year and hold parties without University over-
sight that other fraternities and sororities have.
The University's disaffiliation doesn't solve any
of the problems that plagued the fraternity and
instead allows these organizations even more
freedom as they no longer have to answer to a
university governing body.
By and large, these incidents receive the
most punishment only when they cause enough
attention, like in Pike's case, with many more
serious infractions left unaddressed. There's
a lack of transparency associated with these
transgressions that isn't helped by the Univer-
sity's tendency to push the more unpleasant
incidents under the rug.

BARACK OBAMAI
State of our universities

In my State of the Union Address, I laid out
ways Democrats and Republicans can work
together to reignite the true engine of Amer-
ica's economic growth - a rising, thriving
middle class.
We should ask ourselves three questions
every day: How do we bring good jobs to Amer-
ica? How do we equip people with the skills
those jobs require? And how do we make sure
hard work leads to a decent living?
Strengthening the middle class requires
making America a magnet for new jobs and
manufacturing and rewarding hard work with
wages that allow families to raise their children
and get ahead. But it also means recognizing
that the surest path into the middle class will
always be a good education.
As college students, you're already well on
your way. The education you're getting right
now is the single best investment you can
make in yourselves and your future, and it will
put you in the best position to get a good job
and build a great life for yourselves and your
families. Now it's up to us to help keep the
cost of that investment within reach, and to
give even more Americans the opportunity to
earn the education and skills that a high-tech
economy requires.
We should start in the earliest years by offer-
ing high-quality preschool to every child in
America, because we know kids in programs
such as these do better throughout their aca-
demic lives. And we should redesign America's
high schools to better prepare students with
the real-world skills that employers are looking
for right now.
But the truth is, most young people will need
some type ofhigher education. It's asimple fact:
The more education you have, the more likely
you are to have a job and work your way into
the middle class. And that means we have to
do more to make sure skyrocketing costs don't
price you and your families out of a college

degree, or saddle you with mountains of debt.
Already, my administration has worked to
make college more affordable for millions of
students and families through a mix of tax
credits, grants and loans that go farther than
before. But we also need to do something about
the rising cost of college.
Over the last two decades, tuition and fees
at the average college have more than doubled,
and right now, students who take out loans end
up leaving college owing more than $26,000.
That much debt can force you to pass over valu-
able opportunities that don't pay as well - such
as working for a non-profit or joining an orga-
nization like the Peace Corps. And it can mean
putting off big decisions like when to buy your
first house or start a family of your own.
That's why colleges also need to do their part
to lower costs. And we need to make sure they
do because the taxpayers can't keep subsidizing
the rising costs of higher education.
Already, I've called on Congress to consider
value, affordability, and other factors when
they decide how much federal student aida col-
lege should get. And last week, we released a
new "College Scorecard" that lets students and
their parents compare schools based on simple
criteria: where you can get the most bang for
your educational buck.
As a nation, our future ultimately depends on
equipping students like you with the skills and
education a 21st century economy demands. If
you have the opportunity to reach your poten-
tial and go as far as your talent and hard work
will take you, that doesn't just mean a higher-
paying job or a shot at a middle-class life - it
means a stronger economy for us all. Because if
your generation prospers, we all prosper. And
I'm counting on you to help us write the next
great chapter in our American story.
Barack Obama is the
president of the United States.

s an American life worth more
than a Syrian life?
More specifically, do we,
as Americans,
value the lives
of people inside
our country
more than those
of people out-
side it?
And this
question isn't
exclusive to our ANDREW
society. Now ECKHOUS
that we live in
a hyper-con-
nected world, it's an increasingly
significant philosophical debate in
international relations. Ignorance
is no longer an excuse for failure to
act, as nearly every violent conflict
receives coverage in some way, test-
ing our concern for other people.
Even as the Syrian civil war
continues mercilessly claiming
lives of fighters and civilians alike
- the most recent estimates are at
about 70,000 deaths - the inter-
national reaction is tepid. Echoing
this sentiment, the Syrian Nation-
al Coalition, a collection of anti-
government militias, announced
that they would no longer attend
diplomatic conferences to end the
conflict due to the international
community's toothless reactions.
Though the United States, the
European Union and the Arab
League have given the Syrian reb-
els communications and humani-
tarian aid, Syrians want weapons
and training.
"We want the U.S. to help the
people on the ground," said Adib
Shishakly, a Syrian National Coali-
tion member.
Are we morally obligated to
intervene militarily in Syria? The
American national identity revolves
around the belief that we're on the
right side. Though that's been prov-
en false on more occasions than we'd
like to admit, Americans are ever
steadfast in their conviction that the
world is theirs to improve.- facts be

damned. The United States is John
Winthrop's "city upon a hill." We
are manifest destiny and American
exceptionalism, right? Isn't it an
easy decision to sacrifice ourselves
so that the Syrian government ends
its repressive reign?
Not quite. Our history in the
Middle East complicates the deci-
sion a bit. We've supported oppres-
sive dictators like the Shah and
Hosni Mubarak. We armed Tall-
ban fighters in Afghanistan, only
to have them harbor Al Qaeda and
Osama Bin Laden, making us wary
of arming a band of rebels again.
And we 'installed democracy' in
Afghanistan and Iraq, a quixotic
dream that has proven incredibly
costly and divisive.
But Syria seems different.
Whereas arming the Taliban rep-
resented the fight against commu-
nism, Cold War rhetoric doesn't
inform Bashar al-Assad's decisions.
He only wants to retain power for
himself and his followers, and will
kill anyone in his way. Intervention
seems to be less of a political deci-
sion and more of a moral one this
time around.
When I hear about killings and
destruction in Syria, I know that I
don't want our government to send
any Americans into that warzone. It
pains me to admit, but I do value an
American life more than a Syrian
one. My blood runs red like every
other human being on this planet,
but it seems the man-made construct
that labels me American trumps the
human bonds that we all share.
It feels callous to voice this senti-
ment so publicly, but I'm not alone.
For as long as countries have exist-
ed, good people have failed to act in
the face of evil, simply because "it
wasn't their problem," thus becom-
ing accessories to the crimes.
That is why I struggle so might-
ily with my own beliefs. As a Jew-
ish person, I've spent countless
moments of my ife lamenting the
inaction that allowed the Holocaust
to happen, and it's difficult to rec-

oncile that belief with my thoughts
about Syria.
Elie Wiesel famously said, "We
must always take sides. Neutral-
ity helps the oppressor, never the
victim. Silence encourages the
tormentor, never the tormented."
I absolutely agree with him. But
what about encouraging killing? I
oppose direct intervention because
I don't want to see any Americans
die, but if I support arming the reb-
els, and by extension, the killing of
more people, is that right?
Can we call
ourselves humane
while we watch
from afar?
By the same token, can we call our-
selves humane while the internation-
al community sits idly by, watching
and reporting the massacres? And at
what point does an 'armed conflict'
become genocide? The opposition
and forces loyal to the regime are
both mowing each other down pretty
efficiently - does that mean the reb-
els don't need our help?
I don't have answers to these
questions, and I don't think any-
body really does. I support arming
the rebels, if only to pick a side, but
haven't the slightest idea of whether
that move will come back to haunt
us. One thing I am sure of is that

Will '13 be
unlucky for
music festivals?

Tuesday, February 26, 2013 - 5
Listening in to the Best
Original Song nominees

This past week was
a stressful one for
most in Ann Arbor as
midterm exams and projects
continue to loom on the hori-
zon. But for
others, the
past few
days werer
for frenzied
celebration
as some (the
truly, hope-
lessly dedi- ELLIOT
cated) were ALPERN
released
from another
tension that weighed just as
heavily on the conscience. Yes,
I'm talking about the release
of the lineups of two summer
music festivals - Firefly and
Bonnaroo - after preceding
weeks of rampant speculation.
It's finallyfinally time to
start talking about summer
plans, to circle some dates on
the calendar and cross out oth-
ers, all in pursuit of the ideal
string of festivals. Ever since
that inception of the yearly
music fest known as Lolla-
palooza way back in 1991 (and
the subsequent resurrection in
2003), the business of multi-
day music celebrations has
exploded, culminating in the
yearly summer offerings we're
blessed with today.
And yet - feel free to call me
out if you disagree - did any-
one else let out sigh or a "meh"
as one lineup leaked, and then
another, only to realize that
none of the festivals seem to be
that truly exciting? The pros-
pects should be entertaining
and enticing, as they always
are (especially when headliners
are thrown millions of dollars
for a single performance), but
was anyone really shocked
or amazed by the turnout for
2013?
Regardless of my pessimistic
outlook, there are a few acts
at most festivals to make them
worth (or almost worth) the
hefty ticket prices. I usually
follow the same formula: com-
pare lineups by tiers and look
out for big names that tend to
appear frequently. Circle those
that are unique or so awe-
some that they don't have to be
unique, and count the circles.
Analyze accordingly.

with thousands of crazed, pos-
sibly drug-addled EDM fanat-
ics in the Miami sun?
Coachella: April 12-14 and
April 19-21, Indio, Calif.
Coachella is the argument
to the above question. Usu-
ally, along with Bonnaroo and
Lolla, the Cali fest is one of the
premier live-performance col-
lections of the year. Yet when
the lineup was announced way
back in January, I was only
drawn by a handful of artists.
Blur is cool, but honestly, I'd
rather have Damon Albarn
bring Gorillaz and ask for a few
cameos from other performers.
Lou Reed is a rare appearance
even if he's a bit over the hill,
and the presence of Phoenix is
opium for alt-lovers, but what
else? RHCP already did Lolla
last year; the xx is all over the
place; even Wu-Tang Clan and
the Postal Service are coming
to Bonnaroo and Sasquatch,
respectively. I'd rather save my
money for a closer and better
set of performances.
Sasquatch: May 24-27, Gorge,
Wash.
For a somewhat smaller fes-
tival, Sasquatch actually pulled
a couple good headliners this
year: Mumford & Sons, the
Arctic Monkeys and Ben Gib-
bard's aforementioned Postal
Service. But the drop off is
steep from there - Vampire
Weekend, Sigur R6s, the xx
and then we're wading through
Cake and Dropkick Murphy's,
relics of past (and better) fes-
tivals.
Bonnaroo: June 13-16, Man-
chester, Tenn.
It was Roo's lineup
announcement that ultimately
spurred me to write this arti-
cle. I'd heard both sides of the
argument already by the end
of the day: "Paul McCartney!
Billy Idol! ZZ Top!" I have to
admit, the blast-from-the-past
factor is high, even if Mumford
and Tom Petty are somewhat
tired headliners. And R. Kelly
would probably be worth the
12-hour car ride alone. But did
anyone else find it weird that
DANIEL TOSH was scream-
ing in all caps on the second
line? And again, maybe it's just
me, but Bjirk isn't a top-liner,
just like how Wilco (ever the
critic's darling) shouldn't be
the first band on the second
line. I feel like my mantra for
the weekend would be "Come
for the middle tier, stay for the
top tier."
Firefly: June 21-23, Dover,
Del.
I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for
Firefly. I went to last year's
inaugural show, and while
RHCP, Tom Petty and Vampire
Weekend don't hold a candle
to last year's trinity of the Kill-
ers, the Black Keys and Jack
White, I'm still excited for a
few other unique names. Foster
the People has yet to appear on
another lineup, as does MGMT.

Add in Kendrick Lamar and
six more artists to come (last
year's late addition was the
Silversun Pickups, Bassnectar
and Fitz and the Tantrums,
for context), and this festival
nestled in the backwoods of
Delaware should follow up last
year's breakout success, or at
least come close.
Overall, I think we should
wait for Lolla and Outside
Lands for a total preview of
2013 at large. And with rumors
of Jay-Z and the Cure for the
former, maybe there's still
hope. But for now, my calendar
circles are a little too few and
far between.

Breaking down
winner 'Skyfall' and
its competitors
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
From platinum-selling Bond
themes to lyrical contributions
of Seth MacFarlane, 2013's Best
Original Song nominees for
the Academy Awards deserve
a close look (or listen, rather),
particularly the winning track
"Skyfall."
"Before My Time" from
"Chasing Ice"
Simplicity breeds elegance,
and this musical conclusion to
2013's most chilling documen-
tary is stripped down beyond all
other nominations.
The track singles out both
performers (Scarlett Johansson
on vocals and Joshua Bell on
violin) in J Ralph's latest work.
Johansson and Bell highlight
the delicate nature of the song
- a song that sounds so fragile,
you might fear listening at the
risk of breaking it.
"My Time" serves as a stark
contrast to the loaded, serious
documentary.
"Everybody Needs a Best
Friend" from "Ted"
One thing to love about this
sensational collection of nomi-
nations is thateach track embod-

ies its film to the fullest - and if
this musical lovechild of Seth
MacFarlane and Norah Jones
doesn't illustrate Ted and John
Bennett's companionship, then
right must be wrong, happy must
be sad and up must be down.
"Best Friend" is a triple threat
for its melodic composition,
lyrical composition and deliv-
ery. Walter Murphy (score com-
poser) took the style in a jazzy
direction - a direction that led
to nine-time Grammy award-
winning jazz-pop artist (there's
a mouthful) Norah Jones as its
performer. MacFarlane cheer-
fully showcases another skill by
shifting his knack for dialogue
creation into a musical form as
the song's lyricist.
The song is undoubtedly a
descendant of Sinatra's "Some-
where Beyond the Sea," or
Hairspray's "(You're) Timeless
to Me." But then again, these
charming, animated songs aren't
few and far between in the jazz
realm.
"Pi's Lullaby" from "Life of
Pi"
It can be easy to overlook the
most obvious characteristic of a
song, even when it's within the
title. "Pi's Lullaby" is a lullaby,
and though it certainly defines
the delicacies of a mother sing-
ing to her child, it doesn't over-
simplify itself.
The gentile bass beat that
floats within the track illustrates
the water ripple of Pi's life, rath-
er than being written off as a

simple choice of foreign instru-
mentation.
An instrumental escalation
progresses, but the escalation is
small enough to avoid exceeding
its lullaby qualities. One of these
added instruments includes a
brief appearance from an accor-
dion soloist - bizarre, given the
accordion's European, South
American nature - but this is
one of many humble qualities
that makes this Oscar nominee
one lullaby that won't put you to
sleep.
"Suddenly" from "Les
Miserables"
Though "Suddenly" is a lead-
ing song in this group of nomi-
nees, there's relatively little to
speak of. The mere fact that this
original composition can seam-
lessly hold with the music of the
unparalleled musical tragedy,
"Les Misarables," speaks to its
quality.
Given its theatrical nature,
however, it seems appropri-
ate to focus on its inspirational
aspects and narrative goals. In
a sense, the song was actually
inspired by director Tom Hoop-
er, who sensed a gap in Jean
Valjean's emotional develop-
ment - comparing the musical
to the novel, that is - as he was
"Suddenly" thrown into this
colossal commitment of raising
a child.
So here is the real question.
Does "Suddenly" capture the
missing element of spontaneity
and anxiety in Jean Valjean's

life story? Most certainly it does
- particularly rare, given that
successful additions to classic
work are few and far between.
"Skyfall" from "Skyfall"
It's somber. It's driven.
It's Adele. It's "Skyfall." The
Epworth-Adkins tandem
strolls in to claim another
award, just to show that the
songwriting team knows no
bounds.
The composition alone is
impressive, but Adele's vocal
dexterity produces perfor-
mance perfection. The com-
manding vocal tone pressures
the thrilling portions of the
new Bond theme, while the
echoed falsetto becomes mys-
terious, almost sinister.
The accompaniment builds
flawlessly - introducing the
piece with a burst of classic
Bond brass which instantly
vanishes, making room for
an isolated piano theme. The
string orchestra also bursts
in as the chorus commences,
remaining until the track's
finale, characterized by anoth-
er sample of a former Bond
composition.
Interestingly enough, nego-
tiations for the writing and
performance of 007's new track
were being' discussed with
Adele before therelease of her
worldwide bestselling album,
21. Fate must've also been col-
laborating with Sony Pictures
and Columbia Records for this
winning nominee.

So, let's have a look-see. First
up on the docket is Austin,

music, also provides cinema
and other forms of culture.

marquee acts. Add in deli-
cious food and the common
small-club experience, and this
should be a fun pre-summer
getaway.
Ultra Music Festival: March
15-17 and 22-24, Miami
As one of the biggest elec-
tronic music festivals of the
year, Ultra beckons with some
of the heavyweights of the
EDM business like Crystal Cas-
tles, deadmauS, David Guetta
and Avicii. Again, as more of
a niche festival, what could be

I won; you didn't.
'Silver Linings' should
have swept the Oscars

By NATALIE GADBOIS
Daily Arts Writer
In my emotional, irrational
heart, I wanted "Silver Linings
Playbook" to win everything at
the Oscars this year.
Yes, Daniel Day Lewis was
towering and impressive as
Abraham Lincoln, but Bradley
Cooper embodied a good man
with bipolar disorder with such
range and poignancy.
So Christoph Waltz might
have been the only shin-
ing grace in the interminable
"Django Unchained," but Rob-
ert de Niro ("Being Flynn")
exuded an intense vulnerability
we've never seen before.
Yes, Quentin Tarantino, you
are a fascinating human speci-
men, but David O. Russell's
script had humor, whimsy,
grief and a stunning look at the
truths of mental illness.
Ben Affleck, you magnifi-
cent man, director and star of
Best Picture winner "Argo":

and inspiring. However, it was
another Oscar tale about amaz-
ing people doing historical
things and succeeding.
But "Silver Linings" defies
definitions and archetypes in a
way only real life can, surpass-
ing the tried-and-true formula
for successful Oscar winners.
It's been criticized as messy and
confusing - damn straight it
is. The lines aren't beautifully
clean cut nor the images stark,
like in "Argo" or "Zero Dark
Thirty."
Life isn't either of these films.
"Argo," and most of its Oscar-
winning predecessors (exclud-
ing "Ordinary People," the most
devastating movie about boring
suburban life you'll ever see),
are stories of the fantastical,
brilliant, evil or heroic excep-
tions to everyday human beings.
They express humanity either
at its finest, (the star-crossed
lovers of "Slumdog Million-
aire") or atits basest, like Javier
Bardem's terrifying and fasci-

try for Old Men."
This theme of choosing films
that look at life at its most
extraordinary is boring. The
joyful chaos of "Silver Linings"
refreshes and engages, while
still boasting an intellectual
script, heavy themes, phenom-
enal performances across the
board, and, you know, J-Law
herself. The Academy had a
chance to promote a film not
only deserving of an Oscar, but
capable of altering the way we
view fine film. Instead they
made the safest bet.
"Argo" was another smart,
well-done historical movie
about people who accomplished
impossible tasks. It's undeni-
ably a great film, an important
film, but it never surprises the
audience. My high expectations
were reachedafter watching
this film, but nothiogmore. "Sil-
ver Linings," on the other hand,
left me shaken and amazed.

It's embarrassing to refer-
ence that oft-used trope "art
imitates life" because I like to
think of myself as better than
that, but it's true. Life is funny
and sad and weird and con-
fusing and heartbreaking and
heartwarming and unexpected.
Just like "Silver Linings," life is
a wonderful mess. And I like it
that way.
I know friends and family
with mental illnesses so to me
this film is so much more than a
romantic comedy between two
quirky people, or a drama about
crazed sports enthusiasts. It's
not a humorous look at some
crazy people finding love in
their own weird way.
It speaks to the unbearable
sadness and guilt that fam-
ily members of the mentally ill
can feel. Furthermore, Cooper
stuns as a man who can have the
compassion to forgive a cheat-
ing ex-wife but be limited every
day by a disease that causes him
to hurt his friends and family
and sabotage his own dreams.
The Oscars this year have
already been decried as a jum-
bled, miscalculated and even
sexist mistake, made all the
more awkward by Seth Mac-
Farlane's joke referencing his
own presumed failure. Jen-
nifer Lawrence's win for lead
actress - I won't even get into
her adorable fall - is sadly the
only award "Silver Linings"
received, out of eight major
nominations.
Maybe people just didn't
get it. Maybe all the Academy
voters are too blinded by his-
torical fanfare to recognize
such a unique, prescient film.
Maybe I'm just sad and bitter
and slightly in love with Brad-
ley Cooper (and let's be honest,
Jennifer as well.)
I guess all I'm able to say now
is "Congratulations, Ben."

Woodpigeon back
with risky sound

Swedish band creates
own vibe with'Optica'

'Thumbtacks and
Glue' experiments
with instrumentals
i By ERIKA HARWOOD
For the Daily
In the three years since he
released his last full-length
album, Mark Andrew Hamilton
(aka Wood-
pigeon) has
loved, traveled
and reminisced Thumbtacks
on his woodsy and Glue
childhood in
Canada. Life Woodpigeon
experiences like Fierce Panda
these are natu-
ral folk-album
fillers, but Woodpigeon's latest,
Thumbtacks and Glue, manages to
exceed the average assumptions,
even if only slightly.
Thumbtacks and Glue builds
slowly and takes its time, almost
unable to garner full attention
from listeners until halfway
through the album. Even in great
attempts at creating a full sound
* in "Red Rover, Red Rover," Ham-
ilton's light vocals are lost in layers
of backing vocals and instrumen-
tation. Both "Sufferin' Suckatash"
and "Edinburgh" seem to lack a
distinct focus and struggle to keep
the interest of listeners. Songs like
these make it easy to zone out,
only to realize that one song has
ended, and the one on is halfway
over.
Despite these occasional mis-
steps, Hamilton's instrumental
experimentation throughout
the album is notable. "Children
Should Be Seen and Not Heard"
begins with sounds of a distort-

Just hangin' with the homies.
ed electric guitar, whose sound
escapes through a tiny amp Ham-
ilton describes as both "scrappy"
and "brilliant." The sound seems
out of place, juxtaposing all
expectations for a folk album con-
ceived by a man whose work has
been likened to Sufjan Stevens's
and Simon & Garfunkel's, but
these moments of experimenta-
tion manage to give the album life
and intrigue.
On "Little Wings," Woodpi-
geon proves that these risks have
the potential to pay off. A major-
ity of the sounds come from the
wet rims of wine glasses (is it safe
to assume this idea came from
countless viewings of "Miss Con-
geniality"?). Luckily for Woodpi-
geon, these wine glasses work a
little better for this song than they
did for Sandra Bullock in the tal-
ent competition. In addition to the
hauntingly beautiful and unique
contribution of formal glassware,
the soft backing vocals consist of
Hamilton reading a book he found

in the studio but put in reverse. In
theory, this should all sound like
an undergrad's poorly done proj-
ect on New Media art, but Wood-
pigeon approaches it in in a way
that creates one of the most allur-
ing points of the album.
Thumbtacks and Glue proves
to be worthwhile as a collective
thanks to Hamilton's willing-
ness to embark on a journey of
risk. Though the album loses
steam at points, Woodpigeon's
commitment to artistry and
experimentation is admirable,
if not impressive. In the end, the
intentions and anecdotes behind
the songs are what take the
album from dull to charismatic.
The makeshift instrumenta-
tion and sincere narratives of
Thumbtacks and Glue promote a
feeling of being at summer camp:
sitting outside with friends and
singing songs with whatever
instruments nature supplies -
assuming that nature is supply-
ing wine glasses.

Optica, Shout Out Louds has solidi-

Through a well-executed blend of
introspective lyrics and dance-pop

Optica is certainly the band's most
pop-fueled album, it's as brooding
as it is breezy, and it's far from con-

The album opens with "Sugar,"

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Playoff picture will
be an uphill battle
for the Wolverines

The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team just finished its
toughest two-game stretch this
season - at home against then-
No. 24 Nebraska and at then-No.
7 Penn State in the span of four
days.
The Wolverines fell short in
both games to end their season
1-4 against
ranked oppo- NOTEBOOK
nents. Their
lone win came at then-No. 13
Purdue on Feb. 10.
Losses to the Lady Lions and
the Cornhuskers leave Michi-
gan (8-6 Big Ten, 19-8 overall) in
sixth place in the Big Ten, only
one game behind fourth-place
Illinois. The Wolverines need
to place no lower than fourth in
order to earn a first-round bye in
the Big Ten Tournament.
"We just had to play the top
two teams in our league back to
back, and that's very difficult,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "We obviously want to be
one of the top teams, and in order
to be the top, we have to beat the
top."
Michiganhas two more games
to play, one at home against
Northwestern (5-9, 13-14) and
one on the road against Ohio
State (4-9, 14-12). With two mid-
dle-of-the-pack opponents on
the horizon, the Wolverines still
need help to earn their bye.
"We better finish strong,"
Barnes Arico said. "I just think
(Penn State and Nebraska) set
the bar and hopefully our kids
see that if you want to be at the
top of our conference, this is
where we have to be."
Michigan State (8-5, 20-6) sits
a half-game above Michigan in
the fifth spot with three games
to play. The Spartans still have to
face the Buckeyes and No.25Pur-
due on the road before returning
home to face Wisconsin. Illinois
(9-5, 16-10), which the Wolver-
ines beat earlier this season, still
has the Boilermakers and Ohio
State on its schedule.
THOMPSON EXPLODES:
Senior forward Kate Thompson
has had a roller coaster of a sea-
son. Most recently, against the
Lady Lions, Thompson exploded
for a career-high 25 points and
grabbed six rebounds, though
she committed a team-high six
turnovers.
Behind Thompson's offensive

outburst, Michigan was able to
stage a .rally on Sunday - get-
ting to within four points on a
3-pointer from senior center
Rachel Sheffer - but neither
team scored for four minutes
before Penn State rallied to push
its lead to nine.
"I liked our fight, and I liked
how we came back," Barnes
Arico said. "We're happy with
our fight, but we would've liked
to come away with a victory."
Thompson's season has had
its ups and downs. The first-time
starter averages a team-high 15.4
points per game, but her shoot-
ing has been streaky. At one
point, Thompson was first in the
nation with 3.96 3-pointers per
game, but her shooting percent-
ages have fallen, and she now
averages 3.7 triples per game on
42-percent shooting from behind
the arc.
"It's important not to put too
much emphasis or overthink
things," Thompson said. "We had
to come out (against Penn State)
and get the win, but we couldn't, *
but now we have to move on."
Thompson holds program
records for most career 3-point-
ers as well as 3-pointers ina sea-
son. She currently has 101 this
year, becoming only the fifth
player in Big Ten history to hit at
least 100 in aseason.
DOUBLE SUCCESS: Senior for-
ward Nya Jordan has recorded
six double-doubles this season,
including a 14-point, 10-rebound
performance against Penn State
on Sunday. She's scored in dou-
ble digits in six straight games,
the longest streak of her career.
Jordan has been a huge asset
for the Wolverines this season.
She made her way into the start-
ing lineup six games into the sea-
son and hasn't budged from the
spot since. Jordan leads the team
with 7.3 rebounds per game,
while also adding 8.1 points on
50-percent shooting. S
The forward played 40 min-
utes against the Lady Lions,
marking the first game in her
career that she played the entire
contest.
"What really helped us
(against Penn State) in the sec-
ond half was that we started
making shots," Thompson said.
"Nya got to the basket and that
was a (huge) part of it."
Jordan also had a huge pres-
ence against Nebraska, when she
scored 12 points and grabbed a
career-high 16 rebounds.

The number everyone wanted
to talk about after the Michigan
men's basketball team's 71-58 win
over Illinoiswas 1,000.
That's how many points soph-
omore point guard Trey Burke
surpassed with a second-half free
throw, becoming just the seventh
Wolverine to reach the milestone
as a true sophomore. Burke fin-
ished with 26 points, giving him
1,013 career points, and eight
assists. But it's another number
that often draws a lot less atten-
tion and what makes Burke so
importantto his team: one.
For the seventh time in 14 con-
ference games (his zero-turnover
outing last Sunday against Penn
State), Burke turned the ball over
only once on Sunday. He's had
three-plus turnovers in just three
Big Ten games, giving him an eye-
popping 1.6 turnovers per game
against opponents from the best
conference in the nation.
"He'sjust really a special player
and we just love what he's brought
to the team," said Michigan coach

John Beilein. "His handle is so
sure, even in crowds. He doesn't
try to do too much, either.

only player in the Big Ten to score
15-plus points in every conference
game (he averages 19.4) and he's
shooting an impressive 48.9 per-
cent from the field on the year.
And as Beilein highlighted fol-
lowing Sunday's win, Burke is
a reliable option from the free-
throw stripe, making him the
prototypical player to handle the
ball with a late-game lead. Even
when trapped or double-teamed,
Burke has proven that he won't
turn the ball over, forcing teams
to send him to the line, where he's
shooting 81.3 percent in confer-
ence play.
Against the Fighting Illini,
Burke connected on eight of his
10 free throws, including a 5-for-
6 stretch with less than two min-
utes remaining to seal the game.
"Here's what I love about Trey:

lutely terrific," Beilein said. "We
needed to win that game from
the foul line with the way they
can shoot 3s, and he did what he
needed to do then because we
obviously want the ball in his

In a perfect world, the Michi-
gan hockey team wouldn't have
waited until the penultimate
weekend of the regular season to
get its first road series sweep.
But the Wolverines are more
than content with their sweep
over rival Ohio NOTEBOOK
State in Colum-
bus this past
weekend.
And if there were any ideal
time for Michigan to get hot, it
would be right before the play-
offs.
Back in January, Michigan
coach Red Berenson started
preaching the importance of
playing "playoff hockey" to the
Wolverines as a way to try and
break them out of their slump.
Before this weekend, there'
d been glimpses of this mindset
but Michigan still had trouble
putting one full game togeth-.
er, let alone two.Finally, that
changed this weekend,
"I think the thing that we took
a huge step in this weekend was
facing adversity," said sopho-
more forward Andrew Sinelli.
"(Ohio State) would score a goal
and we'd jump right back and
score again. In playoffs, there's
going to be adversity and you
have to know how to face it, so
we're finally starting to figure
that out."

The most notable improve-
ment for the Wolverines was the
lack of a third-period collapse.
In addition to better defensive-
zone coverage, much of the
Wolverines' success in the final
frame of Saturday's game has to
be attributed to freshman goal-
tender Steve Racine, who held
the Buckeyes scoreless.
Without that steadfastness
in net and from the forward
corps which buried the hatchet
on Saturday with three goals,
Berenson believes the weekend
would've had a completely dif-
ferent outcome.
"We saw a little bit of (play-
off hockey) but we're not there
yet," Berenson said. "We played
in two close games. If you had
to put the whole weekend in
perspective, you'd say the third
period on Saturday decided the
weekend. That was good."
GUPTILL'S MANY FACES:
The Alex Guptill who played
this weekend was a far cry from
the Alex Guptill who played for
the Wolverines a few months
ago,
The sophomore forward is
coming off two ga-ahead goals
against the Buckeyes and was
named CCHA Offensive Player
of the Week on Monday - a
complete turnaround for some-
one who was a healthy scratch
in December for having a less-
than-desirable work ethic and a
poor approach to the game.

"The attitude goes along
with your play," Berenson said.
"We've been after him to work
harder. You can have talent, but
you have to work hard and play
the whole game."
As the coach explains, some-
one like Guptill might play for
around 20 minutes a game, but
only have possession of the puck
for 30 seconds. It's what a play-
er does with the 19-and-a-half
minutes that he doesn't have the
puck that makes him a better
hockey player.
"You've got to be working in
our zone, in their zone ... tak-
ing care of business and being a
complete player," Berenson said.
"That's what we try to do with
all our players. (Guptill) has
been challenged this year, and I
think he's getting some of that."
SINELLI SCORES: Sinelli
hasn't always been a consistent
presence in Michigan's lineup,
appearing in just 16 of 32 games.
But Berenson's gamble to play
him in place of senior Lindsay
Sparks paid off on Saturday
night when Sinelli's snipe from
the circle gave the Wolverines a
comfortable two-goal lead over
the Buckeyes.
"I think (I just fed) off the
energy from everybody," he
said. "My goal was pretty lucky
to be honest," he said. "The
goalie just misplayed it, and I
was fortunate to get the puck in
the net."
