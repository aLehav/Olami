Union will ask for
pay raises, increased
health benefits and
job security
By DARRYN FITZGERALD
Daily Staff Reporter
University administrators and
the union that represents lecturers
at the University will begin negoti-
ating a new three-year contract for
lecturers today.
This year's negotiations mark
the third collective bargaining
agreement between the Univer-
sity and the Lecturer's Employee
Organization - which represents
about 1,500 full and part-time fac-
ulty members - and the University.
LEO hopes to draft a new contract
that will include pay increases, bet-
ter health benefits and more job
security for lecturers.
The semester-long negotiations
will start today with opening state-
ments from both LEO officials and
University administrators.
Inrecentinterviews, representa-
tives from both sides said the talks
will address contractual issues sim-
ilar to those discussed in the past.
"The expectations of the Univer-
sity are not any different than past
negotiations," said Jeffery Frum-

kin, associate vice provost and
senior director of academic human
resources.
Joseph Walls - a lecturer of
Business Information Technology
and media liaison for LEO - said
despite the recession, members of
LEO's bargaining committee hope
to get higher salaries written into
this year's contract.
"We are going to ask for salary
increases," Walls said. "We feel it is
feasible for us to do that despite the
circumstances."
Lecturers represent roughly 30
percent of the faculty at the Univer-
sity's Ann Arbor campus, but their
salaries account for1 percent of the
total Ann Arbor campus budget,
according to an LEO press release
given to The Michigan Daily earlier
this week.
LEO President Bonnie Halloran
wrote in the press release that pay
raises for lecturers are sorely over-
due.
"We know that these are tough
economic times, but our members
have been underpaid and underval-
ued for years," Halloran wrote.
Though Frumkin didn't say the
University's position on pay raises
for lecturers, he said the contract
needs to reflect a respect for the
University's financial resources.
"The University hopes to achieve
a successful contract that is seen as

During its monthly meeting yes-
terday, the University's Board of
Regents approved Domino's Pizza
CEO and Regent Emeritus, David
Brandon, as the University's next

athletic director, in a unanimous
vote.
"I believe David's widely recog-
nized leadership skills, his busi-
ness acumen,
his tenure as First reported on
a regent, his
experience
as a student-
athlete, and his dedication as a
fundraiser combine to make him a
perfect leader for this athletic pro-
gram and I look forward to working
with him again," University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said of the
appointment.

The regents also unanimously
renewed the contracts of a handful
of deans from schools across the
University. Deborah Loewenberg
Ball, dean of the School of Educa-
tion, Christopher Ball, dean of the
School of Music, Theatre, & Dance
and James S. Jackson, director of
the Institute for Social Research
each received five-year appoint-
ments.
Bryan L. Rogers, dean of the
School of Art & Design, had his

School of Natural Resources and

a one-year term.

EDUCATING TOMORROW'S TEACHERS
School of Ed. revamps curriculum

Mirroring medical
schools, new program
will increase focus
on field work
By ANNIE GORDON THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
In a new approach to educat-
ing tomorrow's teachers, officials
in the School of Education plan to
overhaul the school's current teach-
ing methodology to place a greater
emphasis on training in the field.
Spearheaded by Deborah Ball,

dean of the School of Education, the
School of Education has launched a
concept called the Teacher Educa-
tion Initiative. According to Ball,
this initiative will change the way
the School of Education will famil-
iarize teachers with the material
they will be teaching.
The program aims to model
teacher training after medical
schools or nursing programs by
increasing direct supervision and
the hours logged in field training.
Ball said she believes that, current-
ly, there isn't enough careful super-
vision applied to teacher training.
School of Education officials are
hoping to unveil a completely new

teacher training program next*fall
for their students. But first, they're
encouraging faculty members and
researchers at the school to pilot
the programs they've developed.
One such program, which has
garnered recent national attention,
involves a new way of preparing for
student teaching-the period of time
when an education student works
alongside a teacher in a classroom.
School ofEducation Prof.Elizabeth
Moje and Robert Bain, an associate
professor of history and social sci-
ence education, collaborated to cre-
ate a system where students would
observe specific teachers who excel

School students
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
Daily StaffReporter
In their junior year at the Uni-
versity, a few friends began consid-

ering the importance of applying
what they learned in the classroom
to business practices in the real
world.
At first, the students joked about
being paid for giving advice to
Ann Arbor businesses on how to
improve their companies. But then,
they realized the idea could become
a reality.
"The joke actually started
becoming a conversation of not 'do
you think people would pay us' but

'how do we do it,"' said Business
School senior Dean Fefopoulos.
Fefopoulos is co-founder of the
Nexecon Consulting Group - a stu-
dent group established in 2008 that
provides consulting services for
local businesses and the University.
Today, roughly 50 University stu-
dents are members.
Nexecon has clients ranging
from Sava's Cafe and No Thai! to the
University's Office of Development,

° ~" _420 MAYNARD ST. abortion shooting trial

Judge vows to keep
abortion debate out
of the courtroom
WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - The
man charged with killing a Kansas
abortion doctor will have his fate
decided by jurors picked mostly in
secret for a trial that has already
inflamed both sides of the nation's
abortion debate.
The selection process that ulti-
mately whittled the jury down to
eight men and six women took six
days and occurred for the most
part behind closed doors. Which
two jurors are alternates will be
decided later.
Only the final hour and a half of

jury questioning was open to the
media - and then only the four
news outlets that had appealed the
ruling closing it were allowed in the
courtroom. Members of the public
were turned away from all of it.
Opening statements are expect-
ed Friday, which is also the 37th
anniversary of the Supreme Court's
decision in Roe v. Wade that legal-
ized abortion.
ScottRoeder is accused of fatally
shooting Dr. George Tiller on May
31 at a Wichita church. Tiller was
one of the few doctors in the U.S.
who performed late-term abor-
tions. Roeder, 51, of Kansas City,
Mo., is charged with first-degree
murder and aggravated assault.
Roeder told The Associated Press
in November that he killed Tiller

to protect unborn children. He has
pleaded notguilty to the charges.
The secretive start to one of the
nation's highest-profile trials relat-
ed to abortion did little to quell
public distrust that it will be fair.
"This is the kind of thing that
invokes the specter of Star Chamber
proceedings," said Dr. Warren Hern
of Boulder, Colo., referring to an
English court in the 1600s that met
in secret and became a symbol of the
misuse of power by the monarchy.
"Secret proceedings are the
antithesis of a democratic society,"
said Hern, a longtime friend of Til-
ler who also performs late-term
abortions.
The prosecution questioned
prospective jurors for an hour and
15 minutes in the open yesterday,
while the defense spent just 18 min-
utes doing so. Little distinguished
the jurors, who mostly answered in
chorus to blanket questions about
whether they would decide the case
on the evidence alone and whether
they agreed that Roeder is presumed
innocent.
Lawyers on both sides then
again retreated behind closed
doors with the judge to make
their juror strikes.
It is unknown publicly what
the jurors' opinions are on the
pivotal issue of the case: abor-
tion..Nor does the public know
their occupations or much else
about them.
District Judge Warren Wilbert
has repeatedly said the thial will
not turn into a debate over abor-
tion, warning Roeder's lawyers
that he intends to keep the case
as a -criminal, first-degree mur-
der trial."
The closed jury process took
place even as the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled Tuesday in a drug
trafficking case that the Con-
stitution's guarantee of a public
trial means judges may not ordi-
narily close their courtrooms
during jury selection.
The Sixth Amendment gives
criminal defendants the right to
insist on a public trial, extending
even to jury selection, the court
said. In earlier rulings, the U.S.
Supreme Court had said that the
public and the news media could
assert their right to attend all the
phases of a trial.

Fire at auto show
causes evacuation
A small electrical fire forced the
evacuation of thousands of people
yesterday from exhibit halls at
Detroit's Cobo Center where they
were checking out the North Amer-
ican International Auto Show.
No injuries were reported, offi-
cials said.
The fire was in the rafters above
the Audi display and filled the main
hall with smoke. No vehicles were
damaged and smoke was being
aired out from the building, said
auto show spokesman Sam Locric-
chin. The show reopened later in
the day.
The Detroit Regional Conven-
tion Facility Authority said a mal-
function in a piece of electrical
equipment caused the fire. Gary
Brown, chief construction officer
for authority, said the fire was not
related torecent electricalupgrades
at the hall.
The authority, which runs Cobo
Center, said the exhibit halls were
calmly evacuated.
WASHINGTON
Supreme Court lifts
limits on corporate
campaign donations
The Supreme Court has ruled
that corporations may spend freely
to support or oppose candidates
for president and Congress, easing
. decades-old limits on their partici-
pation in federal campaigns.
By a 5-4 vote, the court on yes-
terday overturned a 20-year-old
ruling that said corporations can
be prohibited from using money
from their general treasuries to pay
for their own campaign ads. The
decision, which almost certainly
will also allow labor unions to par-
ticipate more freely in campaigns,
threatens similar limits imposed by
24 states.
It leaves in place a prohibition on
direct contributions to candidates
from corporations and unions.
Critics of the stricter limits
have argued that they amount to
an unconstitutional restraint of
free'speech, and the court majority
apparently agreed.
"The censorship we now con-
front is vast in its reach," Justice
AnthonyKennedy said in his major-
ity opinion, joined by his four more
conservative colleagues.

Guantanamo Bay to

President Barack Obama's dead-

people broke into the storehouse,
ran off with food and fought each
other over the bags.
As aftershocks still shook the
city, aid workers were stream-
ing into Haiti with water, food,
drugs, latrines, clothing, trucks,
construction equipment, tele-
phones and tons of other relief
supplies. The international
Red Cross called it the great-
est deployment of emergency
responders in its 91-year history.
But the built-in bottlenecks
of this desperately poor, under-
developed nation and the sheer
scale of the catastrophe still left
many of the hundreds of thou-
sands of victims without help.
The U.S. military reported a
waiting list of 1,400 internation-
al relief flights seeking to land on
Port-au-Prince's single runway,
where 120 to 140 flights were
arriving daily.
"They don't see any food
and water coming to them, and
they are frustrated," said Prime
Minister Jean-Max Bellerive.
Four ships managed to dock
at the capital's earthquake-
damaged port, holding out the
promise of a new avenue for
getting aid to the city. A Danish
navy ship was seen unloading
crates. But the going was slow,
since only one truck at a time
could maneuver on the crack-
riven pier.
The picture was especially
grim at emergency medical
centers, where shortages of sur-
geons, nurses, their tools and
supplies have backed up critical
cases.
"A large number of those
coming here are having to
have amputations, since their
wounds are so infected," said
Brynjulf Ystgaard, a Norwegian
surgeon at a Red Cross field

hospital.
Food was reaching tens of
thousands, but the need was
much greater. Perhaps no one
was more desperate than the 80
or so residents of the damaged
Municipal Nursing Home, in a
slum near the shell of Port-au-
Prince's devastated cathedral.
The quake killed six of the elder-
ly, three others have since died
of hunger and exhaustion, and
several more were barely clipg-
ing to life.
"Nobody cares," said Phileas
Justin, 78. "Maybe they do just
want us to starve to death."
In the first eight days after the
quake, they had eaten just a bit of
pasta cooked in gutter water and
a bowl of rice each. On Thursday,
they had a small bowl of spaghet-
ti and five bags of rice and beans,
and cooking oil, were delivered.
A dirty red sheet covered the
body of Jean-Marc Luis, who
died late Wednesday. "He died
of hunger," said security guard
Nixon Plantin. Yesterday, four
days after The Associated Press
first reported on the patients'
plight, workers from the British-
based HelpAge International
visited and said they would help.
One by one, such deaths were
adding to a Haitian government-
estimated toll of 200,000 dead,
as reported by the European
Commission. It said 250,000
people were injured and 2 mil-
lion homeless in the nation of 9
million.
As U.S. troops began patrol-
ling Port-au-Prince to boost
security, sporadic looting and
violence continued.

U.S. to provide $70
million in military
aid in 2010
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration will provide
more counterterrorism and devel-
opment aid to embattled Yemen,
but the country must show results
for assistance to continue to flow,
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton said Thursday.
After meeting with Yemeni For-
eign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi at
the State Department, Clinton told
reporters the U.S. was pleased with
steps the Yemeni government was
takingto combat violent extremists,
including al-Qaida in the Arabian
Peninsula. That group has claimed
responsibility for the attempted
Christmas Day bombing of a
Detroit-bound American airliner.
Yemen is emerging as a central
focus in the fight against violent
extremists, and the United States
has ramped up both military and
civilian aid to the country over'
the past year. Clinton's remarks
reflect the administration's rising
concern about the crisis facing the
impoverished country and a deci-
sion to raise Yemen as a priority
on its foreign policy agenda.
"Tocombatthisgrowingthreat,
the United States will intensify its
cooperation with Yemen on both
security and development," Clin-
ton said. "Yemen has demonstrat-
ed a willingness and a capacity to.
take action against al-Qaida and
other extremist groups, and the
United States commends these
actions."
She did not detail the enhanced
assistance but noted the U.S. cur-
rentlyhasathree-year, $121 million
development and economic assis-
tance program with Yemen. Sepa-
rately, the U.S. is providing nearly


$70 million in military aid this year.
Clinton's comments come ahead
of an international conference on
Yemen next week in London at
which new aid could be announced.
But she made clear that without
the Yemeni government reforms,
donors, including the U.S., would
balk at sending aid to the impover-
ished countrythat is facing internal
unrest apart from the extremists.
"The success of this investment
depends on Yemen's ability to make
the tough choices necessary to
improve the capacity to govern, to
reform its economy, to protect human
rights, to combat corruption and to
create a better environment for busi-
ness and investment," she said. ,
Yemen's government is weak,
and its authority does not extend
far outside the capital, but it has
stepped up military strikes against



al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula,
a strengthening terror offshoot
formed a year ago by Yemen and
Saudi militant factions.
Clinton stressed that the fight
against extremists could not be
waged solely by military means.
She said it must be accompanied by
improvements in people's lives that
will make them less prone to turn
to violence.
"Our relationship cannot be just
about the terrorists," she said. "As
criticial as that is to our security
and our future and to the stability
and unity of Yemen, the best way to
really get at some of these underly-
ing problems that exist is through
an effective development strategy."
Al-Qirbi reaffirmed his govern-
ment's commitment to fighting
terrorism and said reforms were
coming.

Busting health care
Republicans must put health care reform above politics
The debate over President Barack Obama's revolution-
ary health care bill has raged in recent months. And
the future of the bill descended deeper into uncertainty
this week when Republican Scott Brown of Massachusetts won
the election to fill the late Edward Kennedy's U.S. Senate seat.
Brown's election makes him the 41st Republican senator - and
gives the GOP the filibuster power they need to indefinitely stall
the important health care bill. But the bill is about more than
party politics. Republicans must forego this political obstruc-
tionism and work with Democrats in order to ensure that com-
prehensive health care reform is passed.

The perfect blend of learning

On Tuesday, Brown defeated Democrat-
ic Massachusetts Attorney General Mar-
tha Coakley in a special election to fill the
state's vacant Senate seat. This reduced the
Democratic majority in the Senate to 59,
keeping them one seat short of the votes
that they need to prevent Republicans from
employing the filibuster - a procedure that
allows Aenators to stall a bill indefinitely in
the absence of 60 votes to the contrary.
This election has shaken up reliably left
Massachusetts with major policy impli-
cations on the national level. Nowhere
is the effect more noticeable than in the
health care debate. Ted Kennedy, who
occupied the Massachusetts seat for the
last 47 years prior to his death in August
of 2009, referred to health care reform as
"the cause of my life." This sentiment sym-
bolizes the significance of the legislation
Brown's election now threatens to kill.
Accordingto U.S. Census Bureau statistics,
46.3 million Americans were without health
insurance in 2008 - a number this nation
shouldn't tolerate. Considering the intent
of recent health care legislation - making
health care affordable to all Americans -
the Republican Party should be willing to
work with the Democrats to deliver a bill
that achieves this goal. Health care costs are
out of control, and reform is important to all

Americans. It's appalling that even though
the United States has the advanced medical
technology and the ability to treat so many
ailments, health care remains out of reach
for millions of its citizens.
As the minority party in both houses of
Congress, Republicans have consciously
evaded the role of a constructive partner
in the legislative process by placing politics
above the welfare of citizens. U.S. Senator
Jim Demint (R-S.C.) infamously said, "If
we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be
his Waterloo. It will break him," a clear sig-
nal that Republicans may care more about
thwarting Obama than working to improve
the quality of life for their constituents.
Republicans have consistently used every
tool available to prevent the bill from being
taken to a final majority vote, where they
are outnumbered.
Health insurance statistics make it clear
that the status quo isn't working. Congres-
sional drama won't cure the nation's ill, but
efforts at reform will. Republican senators
must stop placing their own agendaabove the
well beingoftheir constituents and become a
contributor - not a roadblock - to the legis-
lative process. That means putting aside the
filibuster now and working with their Demo-
cratic counterparts in order to make health
care reform a reality for all Americans.

After spending two years at the
University and finishing the
cross-discipline sampling that
is the beauty of dis-
tribution require-
ments, I now knowj
a little bit about the
biology of nutri-
tion. I took the class
"Biology of Human
Nutrition" to ful-
fill the natural sci-
ence requirement
that my philosophy LIBBY
major didn't cover. ASHTON
But because my
nutrition class was
held in a lecture
hall filled with history majors trying
to satisfy their own natural science
requirements, I still don't know any-
thing about biology majors.
Because of this lack of exposure
to students of the non-humanities, I
haven't been able to achieve any real
concept of how their minds work.
The only impressions I've been able
to form are rooted in their stereo-
typed identities. For example:
I am a philosophy major. Iam "pre-
tentious, planning to spend the rest of
my life working at Starbucks, judging
you for being shallow, unshowered."
You are in the Business School.
You are "high on Adderall, selfish,
wearing a tucked in button-down,
loudly complaining about your
finance homework."
She is a communications major. She
is "in a sorority, also studying psychol-
ogy, trying to take the back door into
the advertising/marketing world, hot."
He is an Engineering student. He
is "self-important, socially incompe-
tent, a minority, going to make more
money than the rest of us."
I came to the University wide-eyed
and ready to wring every drop of stim-
ulation out of my liberal-arts-meets-
major-research-university education.
I chose not to go to Kenyon College
in Ohio or Bowdoin College in Maine
because I wanted to expose myself
to more academic diversity than I
expected to find at these classic lib-

eral arts colleges. I wanted to study
with engineers and business-minded
students along with the less linear
thinking, more familiar students of
the humanities. I saw the University
as the perfect shade for me, blending
together every color I looked for in an
undergraduate experience.
The potential for integrating the
minds of the University's diverse intel-
lectual community is not being actu-
alized. The components of my perfect
shade have been divided up, branded
as primarycolors and stuckinseparate
buildings throughout Ann Arbor.
The B-School students stay in
their palace on Tappan Street, only
to be bothered by the rest of us when
we crash their cafeteria for the sushi
option - because you can only go to
Sadako so many times. The English
majors, who are rumored to be the
coolest kids on campus, are probably
drinking coffee somewhere (because
I hear they never really have work to
do) and reminiscing about the good
times they had while attending the
New England Literature Program.
The political science majors sneak
into whatever part of the Law Library
is the most off-limits and try to look
as intensely studious as possible. I
guess they think the more they look
like law students, the more likely
they'll one day become law students.
No one knows where the pre-med
students go. Apparently they lose all
their friends by the time they're done
with Orgo II.
The division among academic con-
centrations is so tangible to students
that it becomes nearly impossible to
take individuals out of their major
subcategory and see them as peers in
a larger educational context. As with
the division among any set of groups,
stereotyping exists often as a cogni-
tive shortcut to processing informa-
tion about someone or something
unfamiliar.
Generalizing the identity and
behavior of students studying some-
thing different from what I study
makes the humanity of these people
less salient to me. I see them as two-

dimensional figures roaming around
the Diag on their way to some class
I'll never take. One method of adding
dimension to these faces that deco-
rate my walk to class is to make our
paths intersect.
Interdisciplinary
classes bridge the
concentration gap.
The declaration of a major can't
be avoided and shouldn't stop. But
the University could make a stronger
effort to promote integration among
the different departments.
Perhaps the University could
implement a policy wherein students
are required to take four seminars
during their time at the University.
This policy - which would be inde-
pendent of concentration qualifica-I*
tions -would provide anopportunity
to satisfy distributional requirements
in an intimate, discussion-based
environment. These classes would be
similar to first-year seminars in that
a variety of departments would offer
them and students from a variety of
departments would enroll in them. 0
As it stands now, the general edu-
cation requirements encourage Engi-
neers to take -a sociology class and
film and video studies majors to take
a statistics class. However, the nature
of a large university is such that few of
these classes foster genuinely collab-
orative learning among the students
wherein we can directly benefit from
our engagement with each other.
The University offers us an ideally
explorative, integrative and broad-
ening college experience. We have
the entire color spectrum, running
through the streets of Ann Arbor and
it's the University's responsibility to
cultivate their blending.

An underrated colun

With the economy in Michigan at historic
lows, the state should be jumping at opportuni-
ties that would provide a surplus of jobs. With
America's dependence on fossil fuels at an all
time high, the development of green sources
of energy should be a top priority. With the
mounting environmental implications of burn-
ing coal, people should do everything pos-
sible to reduce their carbon footprints. Well,
according to the citizens of Oceana and Mason
Counties, in the western part of the state, these
actions might cramp their style.
As reported in the Muskegon Chronicle last
month, the $3 billion dollar project, proposedby
Havgul Clean Energy AS, would place between
100 and 200 wind turbines over a 100 square
mile stretch off the shore of Lake Michigan.
The Aegir Offshore Wind Farm would produce
approximately 1000 megawatts of energy and
power roughly a million homes. The wind farm
would help to invigorate Michigan's struggling
economy by offering thousands of jobs during
construction, which is predicted to take 5 to 10
years, as well as roughly 200 positions after its
completion.
Who would argue with such a valuable proj-
ect? Apparently, the residents of the counties
on the coast of Lake Michigan would. Many
of the citizens of this coastal area attended a
meeting with Havgul Clean Energy to discuss
the project and most opposed construction of
the wind farm. The project would place 300-
to 450-foot-high wind turbines four and a half
miles off the Ludington shores. Though this
may seem like a sufficient distance, the models
provided by Havgul showed the turbines would
be clearly visible from the shoreline, much to
the distaste of those who attended the meeting.
The coastal citizens complain that much
of their revenue is derived from the natural
beauty of Lake Michigan, and gaudy turbines
may lower property values, hurt tourism and
harm fishing. These seemingly legitimate con-
cerns raise the question of why the state would
choose an area that relies so heavily on scenery
for revenue.
Havgul extolled the many benefits of the
project, citing the optimal prevailing winds of
the area and its proximity to Detroit and Chica-
go. The cities would utilize the energy, allevi-
ating the need for fossil fuels and maximizing

use of the energy generated by the wind farm.
Though the benefits of this project are plen-
tiful, the question of the environmental impact
needs to be examined. Environmental engi-
neers will need to survey the area during a $10
million pre-production process taking place
before any construction. The outlines for this
process haven't been released, butI suspect the
pre-production team will survey the terrain
of the lake bottom, create models to predict
any adverse current alterations and attempt to
understand any negative effects the turbines
might have on the local fish, bird and flora
populations. They will certainly consider the
construction and maintenance of the massive
structures as factors. Following the research,
there will be massive efforts to minimize any
and all of the adverse environmental impacts of
the wind farm.
But with all of this laid out in front of them
last month, the majority of citizens of the lake
shore communities who attended the meeting
with Havgul still felt that this eco-friendly,
economy-boosting project wasn't worthwhile.
I respectfully and wholeheartedly disagree.
Students at Michigan are so often beat over
the head with the environmental problems of
global warming and deforestation that we may
forget that not all people are as focused on this
issue. Even so, there is enough news coverage
out there for the average person to understand
that dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and the
dangers posed by global warming are major
concerns. With this in mind, the benefits of
green energy are undeniable.
There is no question that we must take full
advantage of the world's renewable resources
if we are to preserve healthy life on this planet.
By opposing this project, citizens of the lake-
shore counties are preventing the state from
becoming an innovator and leader in renew-
able energy. The wind farm would contribute
to the revitalization of the state economy. It is
unacceptable for such a positive development
to be shot down by a concern about lakeshore
aesthetics. For the sake of the environment and
the economy, I hope that those in opposition
will come to see the good that can come from
this project.

There is nothing worse than
being on a first date or out
with friends, and reaching a
point in the con-
versation where
nobody knows
what to say. The
well is dry. You sit
there and pretend ,
to look around,
admiring the
scenery while des-
perately search-
ing your brain for LINCOLN
something remote-
ly interesting to BOEHM
break the deafen-
ing silence.
Beyond being
as awkward as .farting during sex,
these conversation-less circumstanc-
es leave all parties involved feeling
uninteresting. Well, those days are
over. I recently invented a game per-
fect for such situations. I call it "over-
rated/underrated." While the game's
premise is simple - and at first glance
seems too simple to be fun - it's
hard to stop playing once you start.
The game goes like this: one person
names something that they find to be
overrated or underrated. For exam-
ple, I think that air is underrated.
We breathe it all day and can't live
without it, but rarely think about it.
From here, other parties either argue
or agree with my assessment of air's
value and then move on to a different
topic.
Not only is this game surprisingly
entertaining and endless, but the
more you play it, the more you learn
about the person you're playing with.
In contrast to the awkward conversa-
tions that persist on first dates, play-
ing overrated/underrated gets to the
core of what the person on the other
side of the table values. As opposed to
hearing about what sports they played
in high school, you'll find out whether
or not they agree that Nickelodeon's
"Doug" is vastly underrated.
Here is a sample game for you to
study:
Massages: underrated - "The

Rock" on Washtenaw Ave.: overrated
- Hubie Brown: underrated - CPK
soups: underrated - Peanut But-
ter and Jelly: underrated - Manny
Harris: overrated - Leather: over-
rated - Finished wood: underrated
- Stickers: overrated - The NFL:
overrated - Nature: overrated -
Playing basketball in your driveway:
underrated - Detroit Metro Air-
port: underrated - Bar Louie's food:
underrated - Middle Earth (as far as
shopping for presents is concerned):
underrated - Hanging out in your
underwear: underrated - Watching
sports with your best bros: overrated
- Florida: overrated - The beach:
overrated - Sunblock: underrated -
Lloyd Carr: underrated - Bo Schem-
bechler: overrated (I'm not saying he
wasn't a great coach, but he didn't
even win a national championship! I
have a feeling that one is going to get
me stabbed. Ugh.) - Clint Eastwood:
overrated - Mel Gibson: underrat-
ed - Performance art: underrated
- Skateboards: underrated (were
overrated back in like 2001 but have
recently become less popular, mak-
ing them now underrated) - Moses'
accomplishments: underrated.
At this point, you might be wonder-
ing, "What am I learning from this
other than your opinions on about 20
random things?" The answer: enough
to determine whether or not you and
I have anything in common. If I were
to tell you that I love writing and trav-
elling and am from California, you
would know general things about me.
But, if I told you that I think potato
salad is an underrated appetizer, and
find the "cuteness" of babies to gen-
erally be overrated, you would know
much more about my substance as a
person and probably be able to guess
how I feel about other similar topics.
Now, where was I?
Playboy: overrated - Egotastic.
com: underrated - John F. Kennedy:
overrated - Queso: underrated -
Subway on South U.: underrated - No
Thai!: overrated - JC Rich Korean
Restaurant: underrated - The peri-
odic table of elements: underrated

- The refractory period: underrated
(that's when you get all your work
done) - G-strings: overrated - Boy
shorts (sexiness): underrated -
"MILPS": overrated - George Karl:
underrated - Numbers: underrated
- Instincts: underrated - Wash-
ing machines: underrated - Arnold
Palmer (the drink): underrated -
Arnold Palmer (the golfer): overrated
- Identity theft: underrated (as far as
it's ability to ruin your life) - Ashton
Kutcher: underrated - Sex appeal:
underrated - Ancient Egypt: under-
rated.
Do you need a way
to fill those pesky
awkward silences?
I'm stopping here only because my
editors are making me stick to aword
count. I could go on for days.
In a world with tons of serious
problems, why am I writing about
Moses, Lloyd Carr and Ashton
Kutcher as underrated cultural fig-
ures? Because it's easier for people
to argue about guacamole thad about
the United States's involvement in
Iraq. Learning to engage one another
in intellectual discussions is a great
goal, but we have to get to know each
other and learn to communicate first.
This game takes you on a roller-
coaster of topics, and in the end gives
you a pretty solid understanding of
what a person is like. My guarantee to
you - on a side note, "The Guarantee"
is my Jersey Shore nickname - is that
after playing this game with people
you don't know very well, you will be
able to immediately determine wheth-
er or not you want to hang out with
them again. That's "The Guarantee."
And by the way, Daily opinion col-
umns: underrated.

Jett bridges echoes
Mickey Rourke's Randy
"The Ram" Robinson, but
with a gentler touch
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
As powerful and emotionally evocative
as its message of hopeless struggle is, Dar-
ren Aronofsky's gritty
character study that epit-
omizes "The Wrestler"
ends too ambiguously to Crazy Heart
provoke any change in its
audience. Despite Mickey Atthe
Rourke's standout perfor- Michigan
mance, this lack of reso- FoxSearchlight
lution feels rather hollow
and trite, considering
that the same despairing, inconsequential
endings are reworked time and time again
in an increasingly cynical society. But now,
a year later, debut director Scott Cooper
has set out to prove that not all lost souls
are fated to perpetual wandering.
Part contemporary road film and part
musical, "Crazy Heart" invites us to walk
a mile in the boots of Bad Blake (Jeff
Bridges, "The Big Lebowski"), a folk artist
whose pitiable state pales in comparison
to his former glory. Blake is a stereotypi-
cal failed musician; living in the shadow of
his former protege, Tommy Sweet (Colin
Farrell, "Pride and Glory"), he continually
struggles to make a respectable living and
to forge meaningful relationships despite
the rootless nature of a life on the road.
Even at first glance, the parallels
between "Crazy Heart" and Aronofsky's
low-budget gem "The Wrestler" are evi-

That random guy on the Diag, 40 years later.
dent. Washout Blake (who hasn't yet real-
ized he's a washout) finds his true love
Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal, "The
Dark Knight") and subsequently endures a
series of unfortunate trials. Like Rourke's
Randy "the Ram" Robinson, Blake is
estranged from what little remaining fam-
ily he has, and his doctor heckles him for
his poor lifestyle choices. Essentially, he's
faced with many of the same difficult life
decisions that determined the Ram's fate
in "The Wrestler."
In contrast to the Ram, Blake's genuine
nature is far more relevant to his story,
and he makes sensible choices based on
the hard lessons he learns. Though the
story's resolution may not seem ideal, it
certainly doesn't lambaste the possibil-
ity of reformation. And no one can dis-
pute the effectiveness of folk music as a
presentational format - Blake's crooning

lamentations, ample belly, choice liquor
and portable plastic chamber pot are far
more endearing than the Ram and his
constant presence in strip clubs and tan-
ning salons.
Make no mistake; "The Wrestler" and
its unlikely protagonist are formidable
predecessors to Blake and his meander-
ing quest for identity. But the methods of
the former exaggerate things too much
to retain plausibility, and (like Aronof-
sky's "Requiem for a Dream") the feeling
of manipulation one gets after watching
it is more akin to the ignorant propa-
ganda of a D.A.R.E. commercial than a
realistic character piece. "Crazy Heart"
expounds on the concepts of isolation
and self-destruction in ways that a main-
stream audience can more easily relate to,
and that certainly represents a marked
improvement.r

an a capella group.
"We get invited to different student
groups' performances, so we like to
invite others to ours," explained Kinesi-
ology senior and RhythM dancer Jessica
Rapp.
Langbergfeels akinship with 'U' alum
and co-founder of PURE Dance Xtreme
Shelby Kaufman, who now dances pro-
fessionally in New York City.
"Shelby believed that dance was the
lost art of American youth, and strived to
bring it back to campus," Langberg said.
Both groups are largely made up of
girls with intense dance backgrounds.
"I've been dancing since I was three
because my mom is a dance teacher, so
she inspired me to pursue it," Langberg
said. "The group is very advanced and is
'coffipletely stiudent run, Ahd'gives inulti-
ple members the chance to choreograph
pieces for the performance."
"I've been dancing since I was five,

primarily ballet," said Business senior
and PURE Dance co-director Gina De
Silva. "I danced all throughout high
school, and during smy freshman year of
college I missed it and wanted to keep up
my skills."
Rapp, too, had a similar experience.
"I've been dancing since I was five as
well, in all styles such as tap, jazz and
ballet," Rapp said. "My dance company
in high school was -focused on tap, and
I had actually heard of RhythM before I
came to Michigan, so I joined freshman
year."
In addition to their love for dance,
PURE Dance Xtreme and RhythM Tap
Ensemble hope to create a sense of unity
within their groups.
"Joining this group is a great way to
come in contact with people you would
never have met otherwise, who share an
interest for different kinds of dance," De
Silva said. "We have five freshmen on our
team, so it's fun to be their mentors and
have participants from every age group."
Both groups, however, sometimes
struggle with finding funds for their
performances, but use their creativity as
a solution.
"(PURE Dance is) not funded at all by
the University, so it's really hard to pay
for everything that comes along with
a performance, such as renting out the
theater," De Silva said.
A variety of dance
and musical styles.
"RhythM is partially funded by the
University, but we have to figure out
our costumes and other factors by our-
selves," Langberg added. "We try to find
various ways to use things we already
have, look for cheaper items, or make
things, because we don't want people to
feel pressured to spend a lot of money on
costumes."
"We try to keep our costumes very
clean, and nothing too exorbitant,"
Rapp said.
Both groups share unbridled enthu-
siasm for the upcoming PureRhythM
show.
"We spend a'lot of"tithe prdcticing
and we all love performing, and we hope
it will be a great show," Langberg said.
"We're very excited."

RJD2's dynamic 'Colossus'

By SHARON JACOBS
AssistantArtsEditor
The Colossus opens big. With
bombastic trumpet bursts
anchored by a pulsating hip-
hop beat and
occasionally
Ibedkei up
by a heavy, RJD2
vaguely Mid-
dle Eastern TheColossus
* motif, opener Rs Electrical
"Let There Be Connections
Horns" lets
RJD2 loose at his instrumen-
tal finest - thick, melodic and
mesmerizing.
The creatively named Ram-
ble John Krohn (RJD2 is a
nickname from his high school
days) has always been bold.
Melding instrumental hip hop
and ambient electronica, he
managed to create a sound like
nothing else on his 2002 debut
album, Deadringer.
With an approach that rang-
es from unashamedly badass
("The Horror") to lounge-style
classy ("A Beautiful Mine" -
the theme song for TV's "Mad
Men"), RJD2's musical reper-
toire is vast and varied. Often
compared to California-based
DJ Shadow, RJD2 similarly

sticks to instrumental tracks.
So the world was confused
when, on 2007's The Third
Hand, RJ suddenly started
singing - and not very well.
But The Colossus shows lis-
teners what RJD2 has been get-
ting at the whole time. Most of
the album's'sorigs have l yics,
but RJ treats the vocal track
like another instrument, using
vocals to support the instru-
mentals instead of the other
way around. And as he explains
in an overdone Cockney accent
on "Salud 2," he's "assembled a
healthy bunch of folks who are
much more talented than (he
is)" to lend their voices to the
album.
As if ambient instrumen-
tal hip-hop electronica wasn't
enough of a mouthful, RJ has
added even more styles to The
Colossus. Single "Games You
Can Win" has somewhat of a
retro-soul feel, with Ethiopi-
an-born singer Kenna croon-
ing "Keep your mouth shut 'til
you get in / And only play the
games you can win." Only its
gentle chimes keep the track in
the realm of twinkly trip-hop.
"A Son's Cycle" is the hard-
est-rapping RJD2 song yet
- its bass line is simple and

The Spooniest Spoon yet

Asphalt rivalry makes for asinine television

By NICK YRIBAR
For the Daily
It's the best trick a documentarian can
pull off when she takes something obscure
- something usually
available only to the initi-
ated - and makes it acces-
sible. Better still when Madhouse
she makes it entertaining.
Recent documentaries Sundays at
have found critical and 10 p.m.
commercial success in History
this vein; "King ofKong: A
Fistful of Quarters" made
competitive, retro video-gaming a harrow-
ing human drama; "Spellbound" did the
same with youth spelling bees.
Television, especially in the form of
reality television, has aimed in the same
direction with mixed results. For every
"Pawn Stars" success story, there's three
or four iterations of "Fat Camp" trailing
behind, making us dumber one hour at
a time. History's new show "Madhouse"
aspires to something transcending fluff,
something like a meaningful exploration
of a particular American subculture. In
the end, it falls short.
"Madhouse" is focused on the 16-week
stock car racing season at Bowman Gray
Stadium in Winston-Salem N.C., a leg-
endary race track that was one of the first
NASCAR certified venues. The action is
centered .on the personalities and clashes
of four racing teams, and it shows their col-
lisions both on and off the race track. Two

of the teams, the Millers and the Myers,
have been nicknamed the "Hatfield's and
McCoy's of stock car racing" as a result of
their bitter and mutual dislike that finds its
roots in generations long passed.
This personal, emotional investment
gives "Madhouse" its initial appeal. The
racers at these events lack big name spon-
sorship and professional pit crews, and
there's little to no chance of any of the
teams making any money over the course
of the season. What's left is the drive to
win - and a mean, sunburned itch to beat
the other guy. It's hard not to be taken with
the drivers' willingness to sacrifice money
and family, blood and bone for a half year's
worth of bragging rights.
Unfortunately, when all is said and
done, there's only so much you can do with
a show about racing. How long can you
watch proudly self-proclaimed rednecks
assemble and then disassemble their stock
Rednecks take the
track by storm.
cars? Even the bitter rivalry between the
Myer and Miller families began to ring
false about halfway through, giving the
distinct sense that perhaps the vitriol had
more to do with upping attendance at the
races and putting on a show for History
than any actual animosity.

And of course, there's not much in the
way of actual racing. Like so many racing
fans, "Madhouse" is more interested in
the crashes than in the race (which takes
up less than five minutes in the hour-long
program), whether those crashes are park-
ing lot fistfights or t-boned stock cars.
Ultimately, it's never quite clear whether
History wants us to observe and laugh at
these passionate amateurs or pop open
a cold one, yell at the TV and cheer them
on. The safe route is to do neither, to give
"Madhouse" a wide berth so it can pass
you by while you try not to choke on the
fumes.

Daily Music Editor
Perfectionism and rock'n'roll don't
tend to go hand in hand. For a style
that relies on impromptu miscues
and sheer feeling,
rock'n'roll is a label ****
typically reserved
for true greats --the $P"
Rolling Stones-caliber
musicians of yore. But Transference
Spoon has found a way Merge
to combine a perfec-
tionist work habit with the rhythm and
soul of traditional rock, creating a tight
style that comes off as unruffled and
spontaneous as that of the greats.
But while nearly every track the band
has recorded throughout its 16-year,
seven-LP career sounds like a coolly
half-hashed studio demo, frontman Britt
Daniel would be the first to admit how
carefully planned each track is - back-
ground chatter and all.
Transference, the Austin band's lat-
est, continues the remarkably con-
sistent streak of albums the band has
delivered in the past decade, though it
is decidedly less hi-fi and radio-ready
as its predecessor, 2007's Ga Ga Ga Ga
Ga. Spoon opted to self-produce Trans-
ference, and the album is a return to the
barest elements of what makes the band
tick: sparse, carefully-laid instrumenta-
tion, Daniel's cool if not cryptic lyrics
and a steady groove.
"Before Destruction" opens the album
with Daniel's acoustic guitar and vocals
captured from a distant room mic,
making it sound like he's playing from
a few feet behind your speakers. The
undressed sound of the first track sets a
tone for the rest of the album, in which
pop hooks and'Daniel's willfully obscure
lyrics are interspersed with longer, more
open-ended instrumental jogs.
"Is Love Forever?" is driven by quick,
punchy guitars and syncopated vocal
rhythms, eschewing additional studio
trickery in favor of meat-and-potatoes
indie rock. Leading single "Written In
Reverse" is more fully formed, with
jagged guitars and driving, fuzzed-out
bass filling in the gaps between the one-
two rhythmic jaunt of piano strikes and
drum hits.
"I Saw the Light" and "Goodnight
Laura" are also clear standouts, the lat-
ter being a rare Spoon ballad. Driven

Holden Caulfield's family Christmas.
by bare piano and a crooning Daniel,
it'd sound just as at home as one of the
more sincere, soft-spoken tracks on The
Beatles' TheBeatles (better known as the
White Album).
While the majority of Spoon's albums
have been restricted to a run time of 36
minutes, here the jams run free, making
for a more open-ended affair. Though
Transference is decidedly less neatly
wrapped than Spoon's previous efforts,
it nonetheless maintains the band's
It transcends into
awesomeness.
uncanny knack for implanting pop hooks
and memorable moments within songs
that may have otherwise turned out dis-
jointed and half-formed.
It would have been easy for Spoon to
replicate the immediate pop appeal ofGa
Ga Ga Ga Ga, its most successful record
to date. Even expected. But expectations
are overrated, especially with an album
as unassumingly brilliant as Transfer-
ence. If anything, it acts more as a sequel
to the o-fi minimalism of 2002's Kill the
Moonlight, with eight years of wisdom
in production and songwriting clearly
gained along the way.
Perfectionists as they are, it seems
only logical that the members of Spoon
are most in their element when they're
doing it all themselves: "It's the most
that we sounded like us yet," Daniel
said in an interview with the New York
Times. And if Transference is any indica-
tion, that's just the way it should be.

What's black and white and redneck all over?

REGENTS
From Page 1
lower deck seats of the arena, which
will be made to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
Other changes to the arena include
the addition of handrails and eleva-
tors, andthewideningand changing
ofaislelocations.
Hank Baier, associate vice presi-
dent for Facilities and Operations,
said the plans include input from
individuals and organizations with
concerns about compliance with the
act.
The arena's fire detection and
suppression systems, the emergency
generator and emergency egress
lighting will also all be improved, in
addition to the construction of a new
roof.
The regents authorized the
University to commission TMP
Architecture, a Michigan-based
architectural firm, to begin revamp-
ing the area, and also approved the
contracts for the construction of a
new 57,000 square-foot basketball
practice facility - slated to cost
$23.2 million.
The practice facility - which will
be completed in fall 2011 - will be
added to the arena and will include
twopractice courts, alargerstrength
and conditioning area, new locker
rooms for both basketball teams and
offices for coaches and staff.
FULLER ROAD STATION
APPROVED
Aside from University athlet-
ics, the regents also approved

plans to split the cost of a new
parking structure with the City
of Ann Arbor, despite objections
from an area environmental
organization.
The structure, which will
be called the Fuller Road Sta-
tion, will include bus ports, bike
locks, lockers and a 1,000-space
parking structure.
James D'Amour, a represen-
tative from the Huron Valley
Sierra Club, spoke at the meeting
and said the club is "deeply dis-
appointed in the project."
D'Amour called the project
"unethical" because the land
intended for the Fuller Road Sta-
tion includes city parkland. A
city charter requires a city-wide
vote to approve construction on
park property. However, Baier
voiced the view of many regents
when he said the land has been
a parking lot for about 20 years
and for that reason he sees no
restrictions to the project.
The costs of the new struc-
ture - which is to be complet-
ed by mid-2012 - will be split
between the University and the
city and will total $46,550,000,
$36,309,000 or 78 percent of
which will be paid for by the
University. The University will
likewise gain use of 78 percent of
its parking spaces.
UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
TOPS $1 BILLION
Despite the stagnant state of
Michigan's economy, research
spending at the University
increased 9.4 percent last year,

surpassing $1 billion for the first
time ever, according to a report
delivered totheregentsyesterday
by Stephen R. Forrest, University
vice president for research.
"We've continued to thrive in
times of uncertain opportunity
because of the high quality of our
faculty across the disciplines,"
Forrest said.
University researchers
received around $220 million
last year from the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act,
Forrest said.
University faculty released
350 new inventions and licensed
eight new start-up businesses in
2009.
"We're entering a period when
University researchers will be
working hand in glove with gov-
ernment and industry partners
so that all aspects of a prob-
lem - from the fundamental to
the applied - will be addressed
simultaneously," Forrest said.
Additionally, Forrest
announced that 300 University
employees will be moving into
the new North Campus Research
Complex this spring. Forrest
told the regents that he hoped
the NCRC would help foster
interdisciplinary cooperation in
research.
"Now is the time to do it,"
Forrest said of fostering more
research collaboration at the
NCRC. "The University of
Michigan's research profile has
never been stronger. And at this
moment in time we also have
acquired this enormous resource
that allows for rapid growth."

EDUCATION
i# From Page 1
at certain aspects of teaching.
Both Moje and Bain began
their project, which has been in
the works for four years, with the
goal of de-compartmentalizing the
undergraduate education of their
students.
They noticed a disconnect
between their students' classes
in LSA and the work the students
were doing in the School of Educa-
tion.
"A major goal of our work," Moje
said, "was to try to defragment and
bring coherence to teacher educa-
tion and really the whole educa-
tional experience for pre-service
teachers at the point when they
enter the School of Education,
actually even before."
Pre-service teachers are educa-
tion students who have yet to begin
their student teaching term.
The major shift towards their
goal of defragmentation came when
Moje's core literacy course, which
explores reading and writing for all
majors, was separated into concen-
tration specific sections.
In addition to making the lit-
eracy course subject specific, offi-
cials are testing out another pilot
program.
Much like medical students on
rounds through a hospital, stu-
dents in the social studies section
of the School of Education rotate
between classes at high schools to
observe certain techniques that
each teacher does well.
In their first semester in the
School of Education, students
participated in three rotations
between Detroit Western High
NEXECON
From Page 1
the Nexecon Consulting Group has
become one of the more successful
student-run business groups, and
the only one-from which the Uni-
versity seeks consulting.
Nexecon co-founder Josh Lin,
a senior in the Business School,
said the group advises clients on
how to best market to current stu-
dents.
"(The group) taps into the stu-
dent market and gives clients a
snapshot of what the current land-
scape looks like," Lin said.
In its first few months, the group
had one client, the Ann Arbor
SPARK, which provides resources
for start-up businesses in town. Lin
said the group saw this first client
as a learning experience that gave
them a crash course in the world of
consulting.

School and Novi High School and
were exposed not only to the skills
of the chosen teachers, but also to
English as a second language class-
rooms and to the different socio-
economic levels of the students in
the classes.
This kind of movement for a pre-
student teachers, or education stu-
dents who have yet to start student
teaching, is not the norm, as most
students typically get to see one or
two classrooms.
In their second semester in
the School of Education, students
experienced two rotations.
This jump "into the deep end"
as Bain put it, has paid off. Sev-
eral students who participated in
the first wave of this program said
they feel more confident in their
first three weeks of student teach-
ing in schools around metropolitan
Detroit.
School of Education senior Ted
Doukakos said this program has
given him the tools to successfully
interact with students.
"I've had all these opportunities
to get all these different experi-
ences in my pre-student teaching,"
Doukakos said.
"It's been immensely benefi-
cial because now that I'm actually
doing my full-time student teach-
ing I've been able to immediately
get up in front a class and have the
confidence that I needed to focus
on working out my lesson plans and
interacting with the students and
really developing as a teacher."
Doukakos said that he believes
this intensive training teaching
program will bring more respect to
the profession of teaching.
"This program is putting educa-
tors on a higher level of respect,"
Doukakos said. "It's treating them

like the job that we are going into
is important enough and it's a
grave enough responsibility that
we expect you to be extremely
prepared, we expect you to have
all this experience and we expect
you treat it like a very important
responsibility."
Lauren Bennett, a senior in the
School of Education, said that she
feels more prepared to enter the
teaching world than some of her
classmates in other subject areas.
"The other cohorts don't have
this, it's only specific to the social
studies. And even within students
at Michigan having talked to my
friends that are, for example, in
science or in English, I really feel
that I have had a lot more experi-
ences that have really prepared me
for entering the teaching world, "
Bennett said.
The program may expand to
in'lude the science section within
the next year, said Moje.
Ball said that Moje's and Bain's
project is one of many research
initiatives currently happening
at the School of Education. She
hopes that the development of "a
more interesting, challenging and
attractive" program will help to
recruit a diverse body of future
teachers to the School of Education
and at the same time provide other
institutions with a model to train.
teachers.
In the meantime, these pro-
grams are helping current School
of Education students understand
the responsibility placed on them.
as teachers.
"They are treating our responsi-
bility like it is very important and
should not be put in the hands of
anyone who has not had intensive,
intensive training," Doukakos said.

Ian Robinson, a lecturer in soci-

the press release that faculty sala-
ries account for about 9 percent
of University expenditures, com-
pared to the lecturers' 1 percent.

said in a press release.
The Survival Flight unit is a col-
laboration effort among the Health
System, the AssociationofAir Medi-
cal Services, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and contrac-
tor Pentastar Aviation to ensure that
air medical services are available 24
hours a day, Health System officials
said at yesterday's press conference.
To retrieve the two survivors, the
Survival Flight crew spent a night in
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. before continu-
ing to San Juan, Puerto Rico for a
technical stop and finally onto Port-
au-Prince, Haiti, Pentastar pilot Jim
Beasley said in an interview follow-
ing yesterday's press conference.
Beasley said the complicated
logistics were necessary to ensure a
smooth flight.
Beasley flew with a medical crew
to pick up the two survivors who
required high-level care not offered
at the scene.
Jeffrey Pothof, a chief resident in
emergency medicine, was part of the
medical crew that helped stabilize
the patients' medical conditions for
flight.

Brown said. The caller said he
couldn't see what the object was,
but that he turned over his wallet
to the suspects.
Immediately following the rob-
bery the victim called DPS and
gave "avery good description of the
offenders," Brown said.
"Our salaries aren't driving
up undergraduate tuition; other,
higher priority concerns are
doing that," Robinson wrote. "The
administration must start treating
lecturers - most of whom special-
ize in teaching undergrads - as
first-class faculty, and undergradu-
ate education as a top priority."
LEO also hopes to improve their
health benefits through this year's
negotiations, and plans to chal-
lenge .the University's initiative
to increase the cost of benefits for
part-time lecturers, noting that
Pothof said the patients were
chosen based on their likelihood to
benefit from advanced treatments
only available at institutions like the
University Hospital.
He added that he interacted with
workers at a small Haitian hospital,
and asked medical personnel there
about their need for additional med-
ical supplies.
"You can see kind of the despair
in their faces and the fatigue in their
eyes," Pothof said.
Pothof said he also observed the
after affects of the quake while in
the devastated city.
"You would see an area where
some buildings were standing, and
then just complete rubble," he said.
He had the chance to interact
with other relief workers and Hai-
tian hospital workers at the scene.
He said he saw people from the
United States, France and Canada-
describingthe scene as a "total inter-
national effort."
"When you get down there, the
level of destruction and the thou-
sands of people who need aid...it
makes you wish you could do a little
bit more than what you did," Pothof
said. "But I am kind of happy that

DPS responded to the call and
arrested the four suspects on the
Diag soon after the robbery was
reported, accordingto Brown.
One was armed with an Airsoft
gun, that appeared tobe a handgun
because the plastic tip that identi-
fies it as an Airsoft gun had been
removed, according to Brown.
Brown said it is too earlyto know
what charges prosecutors might
authorize against the- suspects.
Three of the suspects are 17 years
old and one of them is 16 years old.
All of the suspects are currently in
custody, Brown said.
part-time lecturers work less and
make less money, making the cost

Negotiation meetings are sched-

people back."
In additionto the Survival Flight,
the Health System is currently send-
ing basic medical supplies to the
country via a Detroit-based char-
ity, World Medical Relief. Though
the Health System hasn't sent any
medical personnel tobe stationed in
Haiti, officials are collecting names
of nurses, pharmacists, clinical staff
and medically trained volunteers,
who are willingto work on site.
The country - which was rav-
aged by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake
on Jan. 12 - is still in dire need of
medical supplies, and trained medi-
cal professionals, according to The
Associated Press.
Aid workers arrived in the coun-
tryindroves as part ofthe largestaid
effort in the Red Cross's 91-year his-
tory, according to the AP.
The Haitian government esti-
mates that the death toll has reached
200,000 in the eight days since the
quake struck, according to The AP.
The quake also left 250,000 injured
and an estimated 2 million home-
less.

"The first six months was us
learning how to swim," Lin said.
By winter term 2009, the group
gained clientele by seeking busi-
nesses and referrals from existing
clients and from there Nexecon's
success spiraled.
Last summer at the National
Summit in Detroit - a meeting of
business and government officials
to discuss the country's economic
future - the students spoke with
University President Mary Sue
Coleman and she became inter-
ested in developing a relationship
with the company, Lin said.
Coleman sent the students to
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice president
for government relations at the
University, and what was sup-
posed to be a 20-minute meeting
turned into an hour and a half
long discussion. Wilbanks then
referred the students to several
other University departments,
according to Lin.

The group currently advises
University departments on mar-
keting and strategy techniques.
The University also has an in-
house consulting group, the Pru-
dence Panel, which consists of
students, faculty and ,staff who
advise the University on cost-cut-
ting measures. But Nexecon differs
from the Prudence Panel because it
consists of only students, according
to Lin.
LSA senior Mark De Avila, a co-
founder of the group, said work-
ing with the University has given
members of Nexecon a better
understanding of consulting prac-
tices and the inner workings of the
University.

ICE HOCKEY
'M sees similar
foe in Bulldogs

Ferris State's first line
accounts for almost
35 percent of offense
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
When the Michigan hockey
team faces off with No. 9 Ferris
State thisweekend in a home-and-
home series, each team will see a
near-reflection of itself. The Wol-
verines and Bulldogs are no more
than eight
places apart Ferris State
in every majora
statistical cat- a
egory nation- Matchup: Ferris
ally. State 16-6-2;
"I think Michigan 13-l0-1
it helps us," When: Tonight
Michigan at 8:05 p.m.
coach Red Where: Yost
Berenson said. Ice Arena
"We don't Live Blog:
think of them michigandaily.
as similar. We com
think of them
as being a top team and maybe the
best team we've played in recent
months."
But it goes beyond the numbers.
Both teams rely heavily on their
top lines to produce much of the
offense.
Juniors Carl Hagelin and Matt
Rust have been the only two con-
sistent forwards on the stat sheet
for Michigan. All season, the Wol-
verines (8-7-1-0 CCHA, 13-10-1
overall) have searched for a right
wing to complement the duo and
have finally settled $on freshman
Kevin Lynch, who has played with
the top line since the Great Lakes
Invitational.
Ferris State's top line of Blair
Riley, Cody Chupp, and Casey
Haines have scored just under
35 percent of the Bulldogs' total
goals.
With prolific offensive play-
ers all on one line for Ferris State
(10-4-2-2, 16-6-2) the, coaching
staff will try to match up the top
lines as much as possible to limit

the Bulldogs offensive chances.
"I don't want to put an inexpe-
rienced player out there*against
the top player in the league and
then expect us to win that match-
up," Berenson said. "We have to
respect who is on the ice for them
and who is on the ice for us."
While the top lines on both
teams highlight the matchup, it's
the players behind them that will
be the difference this weekend.
"You're trying to outscore that
line or shut them down," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said.
"But in the meantime, if you do,
and tiey're nullifying you at the
same time, then it comes down
to your next line or your next line
and where are you going to get
your offense from?"
Recently, secondary scoring
has been strong for the Wolver-
ines. The third and fourth lines
contributed three of the Wolver-
ines' six even strength goals in
last weekend's series against Alas-
ka. Two of those came from senior
Brian Lebler, who had just five
goals coming into last weekend.
Despite being on one of the bot-
tom lines, freshman Chris Brown
is third ontheteamin points while
freshman Lindsay Sparks has six
points in his last five games.
But excluding last weekend's
series, Michigan has tallied just
two goals from secondary play-
ers since the GLI. With Michigan
fighting for the fourth spot in the
CCHA and the coveted first-round
playoff bye, it needs the bottom
two lines to score on a consistent
basis.
"Any line can be the difference
in the game," junior forward Ben
Winnett said. "I think our line
proved that last weekend in being
able to get a couple of goals Fri-
day night against Alaska. We have
to go in with the mentality that
every line could be the difference-
maker and that's how we're going
to tryand play this weekend."
If Winnett and the rest of his
line can repeat last weekend's
performance against Ferris, that's
something their reflection on the
other side of the ice can't match.

Freshman Dayeesha Hollins tallied 11 points in the Wolverines' 58-56 loss to the fifth-ranked Buckeyes yesterday. Hollins is second on the team in scoring this season.
Blue- drops another close
battle to No-. 5 Ohio State

By ALEX HERMANN
Daily Sports Writer
For the Wolverines, last night's
matchup against No. 5 Ohio State
could have been the game to silence
their
doubters, OHIO STATE 58
take the MICHIGAN 56
pressure
off themselves and move past the
demons that have haunted them in
Big Ten play the past two years.
Instead, the Michigan women's
basketball team's contest with the
Buckeyes ended as another close
loss, 58-56.
But the Wolverines kept it close
throughout, making their biggest
push at the start of the second half.
After the Buckeyes extended
their five-point halftime lead to 10
on a pair of quick baskets, Michigan
kept composed and began to chip
away at its biggest deficit of the
game.

And it didn't take the Wolver-
ines long to mount their comeback.
A 19-2 run propelled Michigan to a
seven-point lead with over 11 min-
utes remaining in the game. Sopho-
more forward Carmen Reynolds
sparked the run with seven quick
points, including her second triple
of the game.
Reynolds led the Wolverines on
their scoring flurryto take the lead,
just as she did throughout the night,
scoring a game-high 20 points. The
sophomore also hit a number of
crucial 3-pointers down the stretch
as the game slowed down into the
half court.
Much of Reynolds' success came
against Ohio State's Jantel Laven-
der, the Buckeyes' leading scorer
and rebounder. Lavender, who has
a significant height advantage over
Reynolds, is widely thought to be in
contention for national awards this
season.
"I'm not used to being guarded

by somebody that big," Reynolds
said. "So my focus had to change a
little bit than what I'm used to."
Reynolds couldn't come through
in the game's waning moments.
After she took an out-of-bounds
pass with less than 10 seconds
remaining, she drove from the
top of the key and tripped over an
Ohio State player's foot, turning the
ball over. The turnover ultimately
sealed the defeat for Michigan (2-6
Big Ten, 10-8 overall);
The game was close throughout
despite the fact that the Buckeyes
attempted 10 more free throws. In
the first half, foul trouble sidelined
freshman guard Dayeesha Hollins
and 6-foot-6 senior center Krista
Phillips. This only compounded
Ohio State's noticeable size advan-
tage. Despite this, Michigan out-
rebounded the Buckeyes 43-39,
including Phillips' game-high 13.
In their previous matchup
against Ohio State (8-0, 20-1), the

Wolverines lost in yet another nail-
biter, 59-56 in Columbus. Though
both games resulted in losses, the
closeness of defeat in both cases
against the best team in the con-
ference represents a major step
forward for a team that was often
blown out by teams of a similar cali-
ber a year ago.
"We were one play away from
putting the game into overtime
or winning the game," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said. "We're
right there. We're playing our tail
off. That's encouraging."
The loss gives the team its fifth
Big Ten loss in its last six chances,
an especially disappointing sta-
tistic for the Wolverines after the
team started the season 9-2 before
conference play began.
"I just feel like we need to win,"
freshman forward Nya Jordan
said. "We should've won thatgame,
we should've won every game we
lost."

S V POLO H 01 SEASON PREVIEW

Robertson key to'M' success

Wolverines hope to
remain best in East

ByAMY PARLAPIANO
Daily Sports Writer
Leah Robertson was going
about practice as usual at New-
port Harbor High School in
Newport Beach, California
when her coach told her to get
out of the pool. There was some-
one he wanted her to meet.
That someone was Michigan
water polo coach Matt Ander-
son. Anderson talked to her
about the opportunity to come
to Ann Arbor and compete for
the Wolverines. Until that point,
she had never really thought
about leaving always-sunny,
California for the unpredictable
(and often miserable) weather
of Michigan. But Robertson
agreed to try.
Now, it's been four years, and
Robertson - who has cemented
herself as the face of the Michi-
gan water polo program - will
enter the pool for her last sea-
son as a Wolverine on Saturday.
Robertson holds the single-
season record for steals as a
freshman, sophomore, and
junior. She needs only 72 to
break the senior record, a seem-
ingly easy task considering she
has averaged nearly 100 steals
per season. These kinds of sta-
tistics prove what her coach
firmly believes - that she's one
of the best players in the nation.
"To be a great defensive play-
er in any sport, it's just a matter
of effort," Anderson said. "It's
not skill, it's effort, and that's
what Leah brings. She brings
the effort to want to steal the
ball, to want to shut down the
other player that she's guarding.
And that will be her legacy."
Despite all of her accomplish-
ments, Robertson maintains a
humble demeanor. After find-
ing out she is currently one steal
away from 300, she asked if that
was really true.
"I didn't know that," she said.
"That's pretty cool."
But don't be fooled - Robert-

only needs 72 steals this season to break the senior record as well.

There's only one team at Michigan
that has only been a varsity sport for a
decade, but has piled up four confer-
ence titles, eight consecutive division
championships, and was been voted
Team of the Decade in December by
the visitors to the College Water Polo
Association's website. It's a team with
a 248-105-1 record throughout nine
seasons. It's a team with a four-time
division Coach of the Year, and one
that's coming off its second consecu-
tive visit to the NCAA Championship.
It's the Michigan women's water
polo team, and it's ready to dive into
another season.
The Wolverines will commence
its 2010 season this weekend at the
annual Michigan Kickoff, and head
coach Matt Anderson says their goal
is to discover who they are asa team.
"We don'tknowexactlywho we are
yet," Anderson said. "Like any team
that loses a good amount of seniors,
we have the potential to be good, but
we're not going to be where we want
to be right away until everybody fig-
ures out their role and what we need
to do to get where we wantto go."
The 10th-ranked Wolverines will
be going for their third straight con-
ference championship this year, some
would say a reasonable goal consid-
ering the veterans that make up the
roster.
The leadership of senior Leah Rob-
ertson, who holds the programrecord
for steals with 299, will be crucial for
success, as will that of fellow captains
senior Casie Kelly and junior Cara
Reitz. .
The Wolverines possess extraor-
dinary defensive talents, but also
high-charged and nuanced offen-
sive weapons. Redshirt senior goal-
keeper Brittany May ranks third on
Michigan's career saves list, with 409,
while last year, junior Alison Mantel,
became only the third player in pro-
gram history to reach 50 goals in one
season.
"We have the confidence to want to

score the ball and play aggressively,"
Anderson said. "Every year we seem
to score more goals than the year
before."
The Wolverines graduated seven
seniors after last season's 35-9 cam-
paign, one that saw Michigan finish
in fifth place at the NCAA Champion-
ship.
But don't be fooled by their youth -
Anderson expects to see an immense
amount of talent in all of the fresh-
men. He said that Kiki Golden, a
three-time team MVP at Monte Vista
High School, has the ability to be "out-
standing" from day one.
It's not the most popular sport in
Ann Arbor, but the water polo team,
with its consistent success, is certain-
ly one of the most captivating.
Some call it basketball in water,
but Anderson described it also as a
fast-paced sport that's more similar
to hockey.
"There's always an opportunity
every time down to get a shot oppor-
tunity," Anderson said. "And it's phys-
ical. You're not just swimming away
from the person, you're physically
trying to move them out of the way
andtryingto out-strength them to get
the ball into the net."
Anderson knows how sports.fans
love to see action and offense, and the
Wolverines were certainly high scor-
ing lastyear. Michigan scored 10 plus
markers in 25 of 44 games last ea-
son.
"It incorporates everything people
tend to like; the physicality, the ath-
leticism and the offense is all there,"
Anderson said. "And you can get some
pretty good defensive plays also. I
think everyone will walk away from
watching the sport saying 'That's a
very tough sport to play.' And that's
why I think it appeals to people once
they go watch it"
So for those who didn't bother to
make New Years resolutionsthis year,
here's a belated one: Go see a game of
women's water polothisyear. The first
chance is this Saturday at 1:15 PM, as
the Wolverines play host to UC San
Diego at the Canham Natatorium.

son isn't limited to making stel-
lar defensive plays. She's on the
top of her game on the offensive
side as well.
"Leah is by far the best
defensive player we've ever
had," Anderson said. "And she
is going to be at the top of most
of our offensive categories as
well. You have your defensive
stoppers and then you have
your offensive talents. But when
you're able to get someone that
you can say both of those things
about, that's a special player."
But it's a sheer love of the
game that has kept her in the
pool. When she was seven, her
dad, who played water polo in
high school, introduced the
same to her. And her water polo-
playing babysitter who brought
a ball every time she came over
made Robertson love the sport
that much more.
When Robertson thinks

about her most memorable
moment playing water polo, it's
not about the records she set or
the steals she made. It's about
the people she's with.
Robertson said it was hard to
say goodbye to the seven seniors
who graduated last year.
"We had this huge cry ses-
sion," Robertson said. "That
was the closest that I've ever
been with a group of girls. They
really took me under their wing
and helped me make it through
my entire college career."
It's that kind of emotion that
makes this water polo team so
special and truly compelling
to watch. Yes, statistics matter,
and yes, winning is what they'll
be remembered for. But first and
foremost, they're friends.
And when she discussed
her most memorable moment
outside of water polo, the only
thing that made it distinct from

a "water polo" moment was that
it was her and her teammates
on a football field rather than a
swimming pool.
When Leah Robertson
emerged from her high school
pool to have a conversation with
Anderson years ago, she prob-
ably never imagined that one
day, her greatest memory would
be helping him propose to his
then-fiancee.
"When I told them what I was
going to do, they basically said,
'we're going to be involved,' "
Anderson said. "We were on the
football field and they unrav-
eled the banner that asked my
wife to marry me while I was on
my knee on the other side of the
field. They were very involved.
And it obviously turned out
well."
Just one more accomplish-
ment Robertson can add to the
list.
