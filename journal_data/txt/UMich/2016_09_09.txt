As part of the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Complex 

Systems Seminar Series, LSA 
Dean Andrew Martin spoke 
Thursday afternoon at West 
Hall 
about 
the 
“Martin-

Quinn” scores, a measurement 
of the liberal or conservative 
ideologies of U.S. Supreme 
Court justices, which Martin 
researched 
and 
developed 

with Kevin Quinn from the 
University of California at 
Berkeley’s School of Law in 
2002.

Martin and Quinn’s model 

encompasses every member 
of the court from October 
1937 to October 2015. It 
was referenced in multiple 
academic journals, and most 
recently in a New York Times 
article on the Supreme Court.

“I think the model does a 

quite reasonable job of telling 
us something about the U.S. 
Supreme 
Court,” 
Martin 

said. “The overall project 
goal is that we were trying 
to accomplish is to develop a 
structural model of revealed 
preferences, the preferences 
of the nine justices who sit on 
the U.S. Supreme Court.”

Martin 
said 
the 
model 

focuses a lot on the “median” 
justice of the Supreme Court, 
the one who sits in the middle 
of the ideological spectrum 
and is an indicator of how the 
court’s ideology will impact 

decisions. 
The 
“median” 

justice is especially important 
for the future ideological 
balance of the court in the 
wake of conservative Justice 
Antonin Scalia’s passing last 
February, leaving the Court 
with only eight justices.

“The passing of Justice 

Scalia has put the Supreme 
Court 
at 
a 
crossroads,” 

Martin is quoted as saying 
on the LSA website. “If a 
Democrat appoints the next 
justice who is confirmed, 
then 
Justice 
Breyer 
will 

become the median justice 
and the liberals will control 
the court for the first time 
in a generation. On the other 
hand, if a Republican appoints 
the 
next 
justice 
who 
is 

confirmed, Justice Kennedy 
will once again become the 
median justice.”

Martin 
said 
Thursday 

that scholars try to make 
inferences about the past 
based on the model, but 
reiterated 
that 
playing 

hypotheticals 
like 
these 

are unrealistic. He said it is 

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Dearborn) announced recently 
that the University of Michigan 
would receive three awards 
from 
the 
National 
Science 

Foundation. 
A 
cumulative 

$8,062,199 will span across 
three separate academic areas 
to combat a diverse range of 
global issues.

“This 
NSF 
funding 
will 

go towards advancements 
in 
STEM 
education, 

manufacturing 
systems 
and 

food 
production 
that 
will 

help solve some of our most 
pressing challenges and ensure 
we continue to lead in a 21st 
century 
global 
economy,” 

Dingell said in press release.

The largest of the three 

awards, $2,999,968, will be 
allocated to a project called 
“Advancing Technologies and 
Improving Communication of 
Urine-Derived Fertilizers for 
Food Production within a Risk-
Based Framework,” which aims 
to convert human urine into a 
safe fertilizer for agricultural 
crops.

FO OT BAL L SAT U R DAY. .1B

Democratic 
presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton 

hosted a press call with college 
students 
from 
across 
the 

country Thursday morning, 
discussing her commitment 
to younger voters. The call 
followed a recent push by the 
Clinton campaign to engage 
with more reporters.

Clinton has only recently 

started talking directly with 
reporters 
again 
after 
not 

holding any press conferences 
since the start of 2016. On 
Monday, 
she 
announced 

she would allow her press 
pool — the team of reporters 
designated to cover every 
aspect of Clinton’s campaign 
— to travel on her plane.

During most presidential 

election years, the candidates 
begin traveling with a press 
pool shortly after the official 
nomination 
at 
respective 

conventions. This year, both 
Clinton 
and 
Republican 

presidential nominee Donald 
Trump have been much more 
reluctant than usual to allow 
their respective press pools 
to fly with them. Trump 
still uses his personal plane 
without the press on board,

The University of Michigan’s 

Spectrum Center hosted their 
second 
annual 
LGBT 
Queer 

Welcome Carnival Thursday in 
Regents Plaza, greeting students 

with free T-shirts, cotton candy, 
popcorn and carnival games.

Some carnival attendees were 

returning students, while others 
were new students coming to 
their first LGBTQ community 
event. Several students noted 
the welcoming and inclusive 
environment characterizing the 

event.

“I think it’s really cool to see 

friendly faces and see that they 
are welcoming and that it’s a 
safe space,” said Engineering 
freshman Jazmyn Rivera. “It’s 
great to have a community that 
you belong to on campus.”

Attendees 
also

Washtenaw County Prosecutor 

Brian Mackie will face a challenge 
at the ballots this November from 
a grassroots activist who aims to 
bring police accountability and 
voter engagement to the forefront 
of county politics.

Mackie’s challenger is D’Real 

Graham, 
program 
coordinator 

for 826michigan — a volunteer 
educational organization. Graham 
said he wants the role of county 
prosecutor to be more visible to 
the public so voters will make 
informed decisions and not blindly 
vote along party lines.

“When 
you 
think 
about 

corrections and who is making 
decisions, 
when 
you 
identify 

leadership, the county prosecutor 
is high on the list,” Graham said. 
“If we are hoping to have local 
officials ready to amplify our 
values we have to know them, we 
have to talk to them, we have to 
challenge them.”

Graham hopes to increase civic

Christine Wylie , assistant director of the Office of Academic Multicultural 
Initiatives, and LSA junior Matt Holman network through asking assorted 
questions about their goals at the SuccessConnects Orientation in the 
Student Activities Building Wednesday.

Engineering 
Prof. 
Nancy 

Love, along with four other 
University 
researchers, 

will kickstart the project by 
installing 
special 
waterless 

urinals and “source-separating” 
flush toilets in the George 
Granger 
Brown 
Memorial 

Laboratories on North Campus 
to direct all urine to a holding 
tank. The urine will eventually 
be used as fertilizer in the 
Matthaei Botanical Gardens. 
Love 
was 
unavailable 
for 

immediate comment.

The 
next 
largest 
grant, 

$2,699,839, will be awarded to 
the project called “Organizing 
to 
Learn 
Practice: 
Teacher 

Learning in Classroom-Focused 
Professional 
Development,” 

headed by Education Lecturer 
Meghan Shaughnessy.

“We’re studying how teachers 

learn from opportunities to 
watch teaching,” said Deborah 
Ball, former dean of the School 
of 
Education. 
“And 
we’re 

studying all kinds of different 
conditions that will allow us to 
learn more about which formats 
will work best to help teachers 

learn to improve their teaching 
of math.”

Ball outlined the vast array 

of costs the grant will cover, 
such as the cost of supplies, the 
wages of research assistants 
and tuition support for graduate 
students.

The last award, $2,362,392, 

will be granted to Engineering 
Prof. Dawn Tilbury and her team 
at the “Collaborative Research: 
Software Defined Control for 
Smart Manufacturing Systems” 
project.

“Our 
new 
project 
has 

the 
potential 
to 
increase 

manufacturing 
productivity, 

which can increase profits 
for 
manufacturers 
while 

decreasing 
costs 
for 

consumers,” Tilbury wrote 
in an email.

Tilbury 
emphasized 

the role of students in the 
project, 
highlighting 
the 

potential for involvement by 
undergraduates, 
graduates 

and postdoctoral fellows. 
However, she also pointed 
out that with such a large 
student 
workforce, 
the 

biggest 
category 
in 
the 

budget will likely be salary 
and 
tuition 
support 
for 

graduate students.

Overall, 
the 
NSF 

supports research efforts 
by students and professors 
alike and acts as a source 
of tremendous opportunity, 
Ball said.

“NSF 
is 
a 
great 

organization; they support 
basic research in science 
and engineering, as well 
as 
helping 
to 
educate 

the future workforce by 
training 
them 
through 

research projects.”

implausible to use the model 
to attempt to predict how, for 
example, a historical justice 
like Louis Brandeis would 
have voted on a case such as 
Bush v. Gore.

While the model lacks the 

ability to make hypothetical 
inferences, Martin said he 
believes it gives an accurate 

representation 
of 
the 

ideological 
climate 
of 
the 

court over time and allows for 
a deeper conversation on the 
future of the court, especially 
with 
a 
new 
confirmation 

possible soon to replace Scalia.

“We 
care 
about 
the 

ideological climate, we care 
about who is in the middle and 
we care about how that lineup 
and the coalition has evolved 
over time,” Martin said.

Emphasizing 
that 
this 

model is just a starting point, 

Martin said in the future he 
would like to see a similar 
model produced to also fit the 
ideological data available on 
the U.S. Congress.

“While we love having the 

model in the press and while 
we love having people citing it 
all the time, from a modeling 
standpoint this is just step 
one,” Martin said. “I hope I’ve 
convinced you that this is at 
least somewhat useful in some 
context.”

DEAN

though he invited the press on 
board for a recent flight.

Both have faced criticism 

about their treatment of the 
press — Clinton, because of 
her lack of press conferences, 
and Trump because of his 
recently 
lifted 
order 
to 

blacklist certain news outlets 
from events.

In the call Thursday, Clinton 

spoke 
for 
approximately 

10 minutes, spending half 
of the time answering two 
questions from students, both 
of whom were unaffiliated 
with news outlets. Initially, 
the call was scheduled to 
last an hour, but due to a 
delay in start time, lasted 
about 20 minutes. Campaign 
staffers spoke for the other 
half of the call, highlighting 
their involvement with the 
campaign and relevant past 
experience.

LSA junior Collin Kelly, 

chair of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said in response 
to the call that he thought 

Clinton reaches out to voters 
by addressing them directly.

“Secretary Clinton has been 

focusing on her message to 
the American people whether 
that is through going across 
the country to listen to their 
concerns or by talking to 
reporters and the media, like 
she did in her recent press 
conference,” he said.

On the call, Clinton spoke 

broadly about the importance 
of student participation and 
involvement in the campaign. 
She encouraged the students 
to 
volunteer 
during 
the 

election season and to stay 
involved after November.

“I’m 
counting 
on 
you 

in this campaign to take 
the 
important 
issues 
our 

country faces … not only in 
the campaign but after the 
election as well, to help me 
fight to make them a reality,” 
she said.

Clinton 
also 
highlighted 

voter 
registration 
drives 

across 
the 
country. 
Her 

campaign aims to register 3 
million new voters by Oct. 
8 — the last day to register 
for the November election. 
At the University, College 

Democrats has been working 
toward this goal by holding 
voter registration drives every 
week. The organization plans 
to continue doing so until the 
deadline to register.

Clinton 
also 
briefly 

touched on her commitment 
to students and her plan to 
make college debt-free. Her 
higher education reform plan 
— the New College Compact — 
sets the goal of allowing any 
student attending an in-state 
public institution to graduate 
without debt. She also states 
in the plan that she intends 
to make colleges tuition-free 
for families earning less than 
$125,000 per year, and help 
those with existing student 
debt refinance their loans.

Clinton said since Trump 

has been able to refinance 
loans —citing his business 
record — students should be 
offered the same opportunity.

“If 
Donald 
Trump 
can 

refinance 
his 
loans 
after 

bankrupting his companies 
six times, you should be able 
to refinance yours with lower 
interest rates and get this paid 
off,” she said.

The University of Michigan’s 

Board of Regents has approved 
a measure to designate the 
International 
Institute 
as 

an 
instructional 
unit. 
This 

change, 
according 
to 
LSA 

Dean 
Andrew 
Martin, 
will 

give the institute the ability 
to make joint appointments of 
faculty members across a range 
of 
departments, 
eventually 

creating the potential for a new 
Master’s degree in International 
Studies.

“Shifting a portion of faculty 

effort 
to 
the 
International 

Institute will allow staff the 
flexibility to help grow existing 
programs and to plan for new 
ones,” Martin wrote in a memo 
to the board. “It also establishes 
greater 
faculty 
involvement 

and creates stable curricula for 
students in its undergraduate 
and master’s programs.”

Since its creation in 1993 as a 

funding-only unit with a budget 
for teaching by faculty with 
appointments in other schools 
and colleges, the International 
Institute has seen growth in 
enrollment and student interest 
in affiliated programs.

Currently, 
the 
institute 

oversees 
17 
centers 
and 

programs 
that 
offer 
four 

concentrations and eight minors 
for 
undergraduate 
students, 

as well as six degree-offering 
programs open to graduate 
students.

The memo to the board 

cited issue of regularity with 
course offerings and further 
development 
of 
graduate 

programs 
as 
important 

components 
to 
the 
board’s 

resolution 
authorizing 

the 
institute’s 
rebranding, 

especially for new programs. 

“In order to serve students 

across 
the 
(International 

Institute), it needs dedicated 
faculty 
with 
area 
studies 

expertise who can develop and 
offer consistent courses to meet 
students’ 
curricular 
needs,” 

the resolution states. “Looking 
ahead to creating a new master’s 
degree program in International 
and Area Studies and offering 
an Accelerated Degree Program 
in International Studies, the 
(International Institute) will 
need faculty to teach and mentor 
students in these programs.”

Graduate 
students 

seeking master’s degrees in 
international studies can soon 
expect to find a curriculum that 
more closely reflects the ones 
established for undergraduate 

students, 
which 
requires 

specialization along thematic or 
regional lines, according to the 
resolution.

The 
institute’s 
director, 

Pauline Jones, wrote in an email 
that the recent change will not 
mean an increase or decrease 
in its annual $4 million budget. 
However, professors can now 
work with institute staff to 
develop more internationally 
focused 
courses 
and 
study 

abroad programs.

Jones said the institute has 

already begun the process of 
employing tenured UM faculty 
to collaborate with the institute 
faculty by transferring a number 
of faculty directors from the 
17 centers and programs to the 
institute temporarily.

“This allows us to ‘borrow’ 

faculty effort to run our centers 
and programs as well as to teach 
courses for us. This enables us 
to ensure that students have 
access to a regular set of courses 
taught by tenured U-M faculty 
each year,” Jones wrote.

Though the institute’s new 

designation will allow for the 
appointment of tenured UM 
faculty, the resolution notes 
that their tenure may not be 
housed under the International 
Institute, but rather through 
their respective departments.

carnival) 
is 
great,” 
said 

Engineering 
freshman 
Jaim 

Befeler. “Knowing that there is 
an event specifically for LGBTQ 
people is amazing.”

Chelsea Noble, the graduate 

coordinator 
for 
professional 

development at the Spectrum 
Center, described the event 
as an important opportunity 
for members of the campus 
community who identify as 
LGBTQ to kick off the school 
year.

“The 
Spectrum 
Center 

wants to make sure we have a 
visible presence and welcome 
our students to campus,” Noble 
said. “It matters so much in the 
new school year to find people 
and friends so we hope that 
also strengthens the LGBTQ 
community on campus.”

The carnival also included 

faculty on the University of 
Michigan OUTlist — an internal 
database that allows members 
in 
the 
University 
LGBTQ 

community to connect with one 
another and find resources and 
support.

When 
asked 
what 
he 

enjoyed most about being a 
part of the LGBTQ community 
at Michigan, Befeler simply 
answered, “No judgment.”

The event was also a chance 

for upperclassmen to return to

them throughout their college 
careers, such as Nursing senior 
John 
Shaver,

Spectrum Center’s Queer and 
Christian Club as a sophomore.

“Every 
other 
week 
was 

a 
hangout 
and 
then 
the 

in-between weeks were Bible 
studies,” Shaver stated. “It was 
intentionally creating a space 
for queer Christians because 
oftentimes 
churches 
aren’t 

the most welcoming to queer 
people.”

Shaver said that the Spectrum 

Center provides a welcoming 
space that helps normalize the 
idea of embracing an active 
LGBTQ community on campus 
— an especially important goal 
given the recent implementation 
of 
several 
diversity, 
equity 

and inclusion initiatives at the 
University.

“I think being queer is 

somewhat normalized in our 

generation, but I think for a lot 
of us, where we come from, it’s 
not,” Shaver said. “So for new 
students it lets people know it’s 
not a really big deal to be out 
and about. I think the people are 
very welcoming and whatever 
your 
experience 
is, 
there’s 

someone there that understands 
that and is empathetic to that.”

Noble said that the center 

will continue to host such 
community-oriented 
events 

throughout the year, such as for 
National Coming Out Week and 
LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 
Week, in addition to more 
educational events, including 
trainings on LGBTQ identities 
and the Guidance Perspective 
Support 
peer 
mentorship 

program.

In providing these programs, 

Noble said the center takes a 
personal approach to helping 
students 
join 
the 
LGBTQ 

community at the University.

“It mattered to have a really 

tight-knit community, to have a 
center where I can go and fully 
be myself and know that people 
got that, so it’s important for 
me to offer the same for our 
students here,” she said.

CARNIVAL
From Page 1A

the current system operates, 
we won’t understand how we 
are losing a workforce every 10 
years,” Graham said. “We have 
more people entering the county 
jail than we have graduating from 
Eastern 
Michigan 
University. 

That should register as a problem 
for … anyone in this community.”

Mackie could not be reached 

for comment Thursday night.

Among 
Graham’s 
main 

objectives is to extend alternative 
programming and put a system 
in place for care and custody of 
nonviolent offenders. Graham 
also wants to see true reform of 
policing in Ann Arbor.

“It’s 
going 
to 
be 
my 

responsibility to also ensure that 
public defenders, investigators 
and advocates are humble and not 
just leaning on their specialization 
or their expertise,” he said.

At the focus of his candidacy 

is the Aura Rosser case, which 
brought the national controversy 
surrounding police accountability 
and racial justice close to home in 
Ann Arbor.

Aura Rosser was a 40-year-

old Black woman who was fatally 
shot by a police officer in 2014 
after a domestic violence call 
by her boyfriend. Though the 
police officer responsible for the 
shooting was cleared of charges 
due to Rosser’s history of mental 
illness and drug abuse, protestors 
have consistently challenged the 
outcome.

In light of the Aura Rosser 

aftermath, Ann Arbor’s Human 
Rights Commision released a 
report requesting reforms to 
police oversight.

“I don’t know if 60 days is 

enough time to decide if a law 
enforcement 
agent 
exhibited 

undesirable 
behavior 
while 

on duty,” Graham said. “If I 
understand what happened to 
Aura Rosser, she was lynched. She 
didn’t go through the correctional 
system or the judicial system and 
there was not proper justice.”

Graham also said that first 

responders to emercency calls like 
Rosser’s don’t need to be police 
officers. He stressed that he would 
have advised the city of Ann Arbor 
to handle the case differently had 
he been prosecutor at the time.

“Not 
only 
would 
I 
have 

advocated that the city of Ann 
Arbor invest money to mobilize 
an alternative crisis intervention 
unit, but also to hire individuals 
who have expertise and skill to 
receive individuals who may not 
be a threat to society but may at 
that time need a source to heal 
and to recover and the ability to 
govern their faculties,” Graham 
said.

His candidacy was welcomed 

by racial justice activists on 
campus. 
Austin 
McCoy, 
a 

postdoctoral fellow at Taubman 
College of Architecture and Urban 
Planning who used to lead the 
on-campus United Coalition for 
Racial Justice, wrote he believes 
Graham can bring the necessary 
institutional reform necessary for 
greater equity in policing locally.

“I 
think 
it’s 
great 
that 

D’Real is running because he 
is a grassroots leader who is in 
touch with the needs of the most 
vulnerable in our community,” 
McCoy 
wrote 
in 
an 
email 

interview. “D’Real’s desires for 
local leadership to re-examine 
the various institutions that 
comprise Washtenaw County’s 
criminal 
justice 
system 
is 

consistent with his organizing 
work 
around 
policing 
in 

Ypsilanti. He’s committed to 
ensuring justice for everyone in 
Washtenaw County.”

Graham faces several obstacles, 

as 
he 
faces 
an 
incumbent 

candidate who has been in office 
since 1992. He lacks the JD degree 
and legal experience traditionally 
associated with the position, 
though a JD is not a requisite for 
county prosecutors. However, 
he said he challenges the public 
to reevaluate the expectations 
of county prosecutor currently 
established 
in 
mainstream 

politics.

“The county prosecutor is not 

a practicing attorney,” Graham 
said. “This is a government-
level manager, so do we need a 
practicing lawyer in his capacity 
to ensure public safety? Do 
we even need to use the term 
‘county prosecutor’ to address 
this official? Isn’t he or she or 
they simply the superintendent 
of public safety? Shouldn’t I be 
concerned about your public 
safety and the safety and security 
of public county residents?”

The election for prosecuter will 

take place Nov. 8.

As 
workers 
continue 

another year of unexpected 
repairs to the roof of North 
Quad 
Residence 
Hall’s 

residential 
and 
academic 

wing, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan is preparing to 
pursue 
an 
investigation 

into the roofing system’s 
failure just six years after its 
construction.

The $175 million North 

Quad 
complex 
opened 
in 

2010, featuring widely hailed 
state of the art technology 
and internationally focused 
residences and dining halls. 

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Board of Regents 
has approved two separate 
repair projects for the North 
Quad roof — one in April 2015 
and another this past April — 
totaling $11 million over the 
last two summers, citing the 
failure of 55,000 square feet 
of roofing. The most recently 
approved 
action 
request 

stated that construction will 

be completed this fall.

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in 
an email interview that the 
roof, 
contracted 
through 

Walbridge, had an expected 
life of over 50 years. According 
to Broekhuizen, funding for 
the repairs will come from 
investment proceeds and an 
in-depth search for the cause 
of the failure is ongoing.

“The University is pursuing 

all 
potentially 
responsible 

parties,” Broekhuizen wrote.

FROM THE DAILY

Safe spaces don’t stop free speech
I

n a letter to incoming freshmen on Aug. 24, John Ellison, University 
of Chicago’s dean of students, denounced the use of safe spaces and 
trigger warnings on the college campus, writing that they impede 

the ability of faculty and students to engage in free speech — an integral 
component of the educational experience. This letter attracted both 
support and dissent, reigniting a discussion at universities nationwide.

This 
week, 
University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
joined 
the 

conversation, addressing the student body in 
an op-ed. While Schlissel’s letter discusses 
the importance of respect and diversity 
fostering freedom of speech on campus, his 
op-ed did not use the terms “safe spaces” 
and “trigger warnings” specifically. These 
are two concepts that University professors 
implement in their classrooms — both in 
syllabi and during class itself. Yes, the 
debate over whether these two concepts are 
productive or detrimental to free speech 
is politicized and widespread nationally. 
But, most importantly, students are directly 
influenced by how their universities choose 
to respond to the debate. Just this past 
March, hate speech on the Diag catalyzed 
a widespread debate over when speech 
should be protected on campus. Therefore, 
the University has a responsibility not just 
to promote the Expect Respect campaign, a 
noble initiative, but to respond directly to the 
use of these two controversial terms.

The Michigan Daily does not support 

any sort of policy requiring safe spaces and 
trigger warnings. At a public university such 
as ours, institutionalizing or creating policy 
including these terms would be a violation 
of the First Amendment. However, the 
University should make clear that faculty 
have the individual right to use these terms 
to facilitate freer, more inclusive discussion.

Trigger warnings and safe spaces are 

not an opposition to free speech. The terms 
“trigger warning” and “safe space” have 
become some of the most contentious phrases 
concerning student life and, as a result, 
they have developed negative connotations. 
Ellison’s letter, like many critics of trigger 
warnings and safe spaces, functions under the 
assumption students use trigger warnings as 
excuses to get out of engaging with difficult 
material and safe spaces as means to avoid 

hearing opinions that differ from their own. 
This is entirely untrue.

We understand trigger warnings as 

any message that helps students who may 
have experienced trauma or distress brace 
themselves before addressing an issue 
that, when mentioned, could elicit a strong 
emotional or psychological response — 
not ones that simply make the students 
uncomfortable. In turn, the trigger warning 
creates a safe space where students feel 
their experiences have been honored and 
respected. These two concepts are ofen 
conflated, though it is important to note 
the distiction between the two: Trigger 
warnings can help create safe spaces, but 
safe spaces can be created by other means 
as well. 

Trigger warnings and safe spaces do not 

negate the opportunity for free speech; 
rather, they provide an environment where 
all people are equipped to face — not avoid 
— topics that could cause them emotional 
distress and are some of the toughest issues 
of today. When a student has been medically 
diagnosed with a mental illness like PTSD, 
for example, a trigger warning is a vital way 
to encourage and enforce that the student 
enters a challenging discussion and adds 
his or her experience to the free exchange 
of ideas. With just a mention of upcoming 
challenging material, students who would 
have otherwise been triggered by a past 
traumatic or otherwise distressing event 
— which may have previously caused them 
to remove themselves from a classroom or 
conversation — can now mentally prepare 
themselves, separating their past experiences 
from the subject matter at hand.

Large educational institutions like our 

University are indispensable hubs of free 
speech. This hub is only bettered when 
everyone on campus is prepared to participate 
fully in the free exchange of ideas.

Where Trump and Clinton meet

MAX 
RYSZTAK

A

s we get closer to the polls 
opening on Election Day, it’s 
easy to see Donald Trump 

and 
Hillary 

Clinton 
don’t 

agree on much. 
But after recent-
ly listening to 
the two candi-
dates talk about free trade in major 
economic speeches, it’s clear the 
candidates have similar views on 
this issue.

Take the Trans-Pacific Part-

nership, a multinational trade 
deal between the United States 
and 
numerous 
countries 
that 

increases trade and reduces tar-
iffs, resulting in a massive trade 
deal with global economic impli-
cations. Donald Trump argues, 
“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is 
the greatest danger yet.”

Surprisingly, Hillary Clinton now 

agrees with Trump’s stance after 
previously supporting the deal. She 
said at a campaign event in Warren, 
Mich., “I will stop any trade deal 
that kills jobs or holds down wages, 
including the Trans-Pacific Part-
nership. … I oppose it now … and I’ll 
oppose it as president.”

It sounds like Clinton and Trump 

might agree on something, but 
unfortunately, they are both wrong 
on the actual policy.

The economic benefits of free 

trade deals like TPP are well 
known. The Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative, a federal agency 
specializing in American trade pol-
icy, argues that TPP reduces taxes 
to make U.S. farmers and manufac-
turers more productive, increases 
the exports of American-made 
products and strengthens middle-
class wages and jobs. Most econo-
mists and researchers agree that 
TPP makes the United States more 
competitive in Asia, which is key to 
repositioning ourselves as a major 
economic player in the region.

Countless policy experts directly 

contradict the candidates’ state-
ments on this trade deal, which 
demonstrates the candidates’ mis-
understanding, or politicization, of 
the issue.

Why 
should 
students 
care, 

though? Most Michigan students 
don’t think about trade when it 
comes to voting. But they should.

Beyond free trade’s economic 

benefits, especially in the state of 
Michigan, trade correlates with a 
cleaner environment — a top issue 
for Michigan students and millen-
nials nationwide.

According to The Heritage Foun-

dation’s Index of Economic Free-
dom, 
countries’ 
environmental 

performance, a measurement of the 
environmental health of a country, 
increases as they become more eco-
nomically free. Economist Nico-
las Loris writes, “Freer economies 
have access to more products and 
technologies that make our lives 

healthier and the environment 
cleaner. … As a country grows eco-
nomically, it increases the financial 
ability of its citizens and businesses 
to care for the environment and 
reduce pollutants emitted from 
industrial growth.”

The TPP trade deal even has 

environmental provisions. With 
many updates to international 
environmental protection com-
mitments, TPP modernizes some 
of the United States’ other trade 
deals (like NAFTA) so traders are 
held more accountable. It also adds 
protections to different species of 
fish and marine environments, 
and provides more enforcement 
for laws on fishing, hunting and 
preservation.

This area of policy unites both 

sides of the political spectrum. 
Republicans, who are tradition-
ally more focused on the economy, 
have been reluctant to support 
environmental 
protections 
due 

to potentially harmful economic 

effects. Democrats, however, often 
find that the benefits outweigh the 
costs to conserve and protect the 
environment in the long run. By 
opening the United States’ borders 
to trade, however, fiscal conser-
vatives can help the prospects of 
our planet, while environmental-
ist liberals can increase domestic 
competition and exports.

While no trade deal is perfect, 

this issue should unite almost all 
Americans, especially when the 
modern political discourse is so 
contentious.

Students across American cam-

puses, furthermore, have a unique 
role to play in this debate. Pew 
Research Center finds a broad sup-
port of free trade among adolescents. 
As the largest age demographic of 
free trade supporters, millennials 
need to counteract isolationist eco-
nomics coming from both Demo-
crats and Republicans with the 
truths of economic openness. And as 
one of the most vocal groups on the 
environment, we need to effectively 
communicate that we can do both: 
We can help the environment and 
help the economy.

Students across the country 

should be rising up — telling can-
didates of all parties — that they 
don’t care about the politics, they 
care about the solutions. Young 
people want to protect their envi-
ronment for future generations, 
but they also strongly support 
free trade — one of the best ways 
to improve the country’s economy. 
These two issues go hand in hand 
and millennials need to make 
their voices heard. There is a lot of 
potential to bring the left and the 
right together, on both free trade 
and environmental protection. To 
be successful, however, we need to 
forget the politics and focus on the 
actual policy.

Trade and environmental pro-

tection are issues with real solu-
tions; they are debates that impact 
everyday lives throughout the 
nation. They are discussions our 
generation cares to have, with 
actual proposals our generation 
supports. It’s time politicians in 
both parties take note of that.

D

emocrat. 
Republican. 

Human being?

It seems a bit odd that an 

individual would 
identify firstly as 
a member of a 
political 
party 

and 
secondly 

as a member of 
the human race. But, strangely 
enough, that seems to be the real-
ity of our current political climate. 
In the age of the 24-hour news 
cycle and social media, it appears 
the vast majority of people have 
already made up their minds on a 
variety of issues before even hear-
ing the details, as they feel an obli-
gation to follow party lines. They 
assume that the other side is auto-
matically wrong — or, even worse, 
purposefully trying to destroy the 
very fabric of our country.

The combative nature of the two-

party system seems to be ingrained 
in the very DNA of the nation’s peo-
ple; we are essentially taught from 
birth that you are either a Democrat 
or a Republican and that there is no 
in-between. But this in no way needs 
to be the case.

In a world where divergent think-

ing is encouraged and we are told 
that there are nearly limitless num-
bers of ways to solve just about any 
problem we encounter, it seems asi-
nine to believe that the U.S. politi-
cal sphere, which contains some of 
the most complex and ambiguous 
problems facing man today, could 
be boiled down to just two possible 
options. Like children, we have 
spent an inordinate amount of time 
attempting to push a square peg into 
a round hole, forcing our ideas onto 
others and hoping that they will one 
day stick.

This behavior seems ludicrous 

given that the political system is 
meant to foster the synthesis of 
new ideas by allowing individuals 
with differing views to engage in a 
reasoned forum and find a middle 
ground. Sadly, this system has been 
distorted, and we as citizens have 
been conditioned to believe that dif-
fering views somehow translate to 
opposing views, that is simply false.

Maybe it’s in human nature to 

engage in competition, and that’s 
why we cling to and defend the ideals 

of our political parties with the fer-
vor and intensity of a lifelong fan 
on game day, but the reality is that 
our political system should not be 
considered a “political arena,” as 
we should in no way be focused 
on fighting each other. Politics is 
not a brutal gladiator match where 
your sole goal is to destroy your 
opponent; rather, it is a coopera-
tive effort to aid your fellow man 
in achieving an outcome that is 
mutually beneficial for society as 
a whole. The truth is that politics 
should not be an argument but a 
discussion.

More than 200 years ago, during 

his farewell address upon leaving 
the office of the presidency, our very 
first president, George Washington, 

warned of the impending danger of 
the rise of political parties, stating 
“the common and continual mis-
chiefs of the spirit of party are suf-
ficient to make it the interest and 
the duty of a wise people to discour-
age and restrain it. It serves always 
to distract the Public Councils and 
enfeeble the Public Administration. 
It agitates the Community with ill-
founded jealousies and false alarms, 
kindles the animosity of one part 
against another, foments occasion-
ally riot and insurrection.”

Washington 
feared 
that 
the 

interests of the parties would one 
day overpower the interests of the 
nation, and it appears that we have 
reached a point where that may in 
fact be true. We are currently in the 
midst of an election cycle where the 
two major party candidates have the 
lowest favorability ratings in history. 
An election where many Democrats 

are voting not out of support for 
Hillary Clinton, but out of a hatred 
toward the opposite party, and vice 
versa for the Republicans and Don-
ald Trump.

We are just several short years 

beyond the time in 2010 when for-
mer Senate Minority Leader Mitch 
McConnell claimed that the num-
ber one goal of the Republican Con-
gress was to ensure Obama was a 
one-term president, rather than 
passing legislation. Our country 
has never been so divided along 
party lines.

While it is certainly great tele-

vision to highlight this “ideologi-
cal war” by plastering two talking 
heads onto a television screen to yell 
incessantly at each other, this in no 
way aids our nation. The complex 
issues that are at play concerning 
unemployment, abortion rights and 
income inequality will not be fixed 
by continuous conflict, but rather 
through comprehension and com-
promise. Individuals on both ends of 
the political spectrum need to make 
a concerted effort to reach a mutual 
understanding of where the opposite 
side is coming from.

The truth is that someone with 

differing views from yours is in 
no way attempting to destroy our 
country or take away any part 
of what made it great in the first 
place. There is more than one way 
to run a country, just as there is 
more than one way to approach 
any issue, and both sides are genu-
inely attempting to do what they 
believe is best for our nation.

We as a people must remember 

that no matter our race, religion 
or political affiliation, we are, in 
fact, people first. This realization 
necessitates a degree of compro-
mise and understanding from all 
individuals, no matter their back-
ground or ideology.

We are now 240 years into our 

nation’s great history; the night 
is no longer young. Our political 
party is winding down, and just 
unwanted guests remain. It seems 
best to return to our shared home 
of humanity, lest we overstay our 
welcome.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Seeking songs for the 
end of Summer 2016

By ADAM THEISEN

Managing Arts Editor

Technically 
speaking, 
the 

song of Summer ’Sixteen was 
undeniably Drake’s “One Dance.” 
Not only did it top the Hot 100 
for 10 straight weeks, but its 
parent album, Views, drew in 
such an unprecedented number 
of streams that it’s practically 
unbelievable. And even if you 
don’t follow the charts, anyone 
listening to Top 40 FM in the 
past few months would tell you 
“One Dance” was by far what 
they heard the most.

But even as I constantly heard 

“One Dance” on the radio, I 
couldn’t quite accept it as the 
“Song of the Summer.” I kept ask-
ing one very important question:

Where are the memes?
I don’t mean that the song of 

the summer should have been 
Young Thug’s “Harambe” — 
God, I definitely don’t mean that. 
But more than any other artist, 
Drake has mastered the art of 
going viral. From “Draft Day / 
Johnny Manziel” to “Summer 
Sixteen”-branded air fresheners 
to the “Hotline Bling” video and 
the popularization of “The 6” as 
a nickname for Toronto, Aubrey 
Graham and his team can seem-
ingly make anything hot, when-
ever they want.

But songs of the summer, 

specifically, have always been 
about memes — each one sticks 
a phrase into the culture. “Hey, 
I just met you, and this is crazy.” 
“First thing’s first / I’m the real-
est.” “We’re up all night to get 
lucky.” “Why you gotta be so 
rude?” “Hey, what’s up, hello!”

And “One Dance” doesn’t 

seem to have that. Of course, that 
opening “I need a one dance” 
hook,” is easy enough to remem-
ber, but can you quote any other 
part of the song? Do you make 
jokes on Twitter about it? Do you 
even talk about it?

Look at how Drake closed 

out last summer — performing 
his Meek Mill-killing “Back to 
Back” at OVO Fest in front of a 
screen filled with corny branded 

tweets. There’s no equivalent, 
nothing that dominated the pop-
culture conversation, with any 
track off Views, except for maybe 
that cheesecake line off “Child’s 
Play.” Compared with how Meek 
v. Drake was just naturally the 
big story this time last year, “One 
Dance” feels more like a medio-
cre track made inevitably popu-
lar by Tim Cook’s marketing 
machine.

And so, at least where I was, 

for the first time I could remem-
ber, there didn’t seem to be 
one clear song of the summer. 
Beyond Drake, it could have been 
anything from Ariana Grande’s 
“Dangerous Woman” or Sia’s 
“Cheap Thrills” to Schoolboy Q 
and Kanye’s “THat Part” to Fifth 
Harmony’s “Work From Home” 
or Desiigner’s “Panda.” All were 
fun tracks played pretty often on 
the radio, though none felt ines-
capable, and none got the kind 
of momentum needed to perma-
nently make a home in our heads.

Music writers seemed to feel 

the fatigue, too. After a few sum-
mers in a row where publications 
rushed to crown whatever was a 
hit in March the first song of the 
“summer,” this year felt less like 
a horse race, and critics relaxed. 
Most of their “songs of the sum-
mer” were more whimsical, less 
charts-based. The New Yorker 
ran a series of “Song of the Sum-
mer” articles that included idio-
syncratic picks like “Bawitaba” 
by Kid Rock and the 1929 fiddle 
track “When Summer Comes 
Again” by something called The 
Lewis Brothers, while Deadspin 
— which last year ran an article 
titled “Calling It Early: ‘Trap 
Queen’ is the Song of the Sum-
mer” — declared 50 Cent’s “Hate 
It Or Love It” to be “the song of 
the summer, and also every sin-
gle other day of life.”

For me, then, with no regard to 

universal relevancy, the SotS was 
Michael Jackson’s “Don’t Stop 
’Til You Get Enough.” I went up 
to Lake Michigan with a bunch 
of old friends for a weekend in 
July, armed with six-packs and 
a master playlist that stretched 

over 24 hours long. Somehow, 
though, “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get 
Enough” played at least 3 or 4 
times that weekend — while we 
were out playing volleyball, mak-
ing a big dinner together, or just 
goofing off. When I look back at 
one of the highlights of my sum-
mer, I hear that Michael Jackson 
falsetto.

But if I had to pick a current 

track to represent my Summer 
’Sixteen, I have to go with “I Got 
The Keys,” the DJ Khaled joint 
featuring Jay Z and Future. It’s 
not that the song itself is great 
— though Hov’s verses are solid, 
and Future’s energy is infectious 
— but it just feels like summer. DJ 
Khaled always sounds like he’s 
yelling out a window while cruis-
ing on a lazy afternoon, Future’s 
DS2 was one of the biggest hits of 
last summer and Jay rapping on 
the radio just brings me back to 
when The Blueprint 3 was the shit 
and “Young Forever” got blasted 
every hour at the swim club.

And I think that’s why I’m 

bummed out about not having a 
clear song for this year’s summer. 
Music usually isn’t a race, and it’s 
tough to anoint winners without 
controversy, but that’s not the 
point. The song of the summer 
isn’t about a winner — it’s about 
having something we all share. 
This summer for me was defined 
by Michael Jackson and Jay Z, 
but those songs don’t bring back 
memories with the same kind of 
power as a track from Teenage 
Dream or 21.

When 
“California 
Gurls” 

plays, I feel a little sunburnt, and 
I hear people splashing in a pool 
and I relish the cool breeze on my 
face. I’ve avoided “Rude” for the 
last two years, but I know that 
song will take me back to being 
on a boat with my friends on 
Fourth of July. I love the fact that 
I know millions of people feel the 
same way, that these songs are 
a big powerful collective time 
machine we can all access, and 
since that feeling got broken up 
into millions of tiny, unique feel-
ings this summer, it’s seemed like 
something was missing.

Young Thug is 

creating new rules 

for the game

By HARRY KRINSKY

Daily Arts Writer

“Amazing or Malaising” is a 

new series in which Daily Arts 
Writer Harry Krinsky decides if 
a piece of culture is wonderful or 
trapped in malaise.

I’m gonna throw out some 

rap lyrics. Stop reading when 
you see a pattern.

“I look good as your dad on a 

Friday.” –Young Thug

“I want the M’s and I’m not 

talking Micky D’s. My jewelry 
gold like the tokens at Chuck E. 
Cheese.” –Young Thug

“I’m a Pisces but I’d rather be 

a killa whale.” –Andre Nicka-
tina

“Chuck Taylor down like 

the Ramadan / Catch a feelin’, 
slipped in on a banana peeling 
/ You got a scheme homie what 
you dealin’.” –Andre Nickatina

“Who come through doing 

kung-fu / Jinjitsu, eating kung 
pow when the thunder storm 
tornado sized symbol on my 
Guess jeans / You on the guest 
list? You wanna French kiss? I 
gotta double check your French 
tips.” –Riff Raff

“I’m at the Pizza Hut / I’m at 

the Taco Bell. I’m at the Combi-
nation Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” 
–Das Racist

“Timmy 
Timmy 
Timmy 

Turner, He been looking for a 
burner.” – Desiigner

That was sort of a trick ques-

tion. There really isn’t a pattern. 
Really, the only pattern is that 
none of those lines make any 
sense. There is no connection 
between a Pisces and a killer 
whale, or Chuck Taylors and 
Ramadan — and no amount of 
Rap Genius will help you figure 
out what these lines mean. They 
are barely coherent.

Now, it’s really easy to call 

this rap low quality. It’s easy to 
frown at this departure from 
substantive, 
highly 
lyrical, 

socially conscious rap music 
that just about everyone from 
Kurtis Blow to Jay Z has taken 
a part in. Even when they were 
being vulgar or superfluous, at 
least they were being witty (and 
even when they weren’t being 
witty, at least they made sense).

So, one way of grouping 

the above songs is that they 
are connected by the fact that 
they are all lyrics from shitty 
vapid rap songs made by shitty 
upstart internet rappers. (With 
the exception of Nickatina; he’s 
been making no sense longer 
than I’ve been alive). It’s really 
not that hard, then, to extrapo-
late that my generation’s obses-
sion with these rappers points 
to millennials’ short attention 
spans, lack of appreciation for 
tradition and inevitable des-
tiny to ruin the world. That is 
the 2002 USA men’s basketball 
team way of grouping those 
songs.

I like to categorize those 

lyrics, of which I have only 
included a small sample size, as 
something called Curated Non-
sense.

Curated Nonsense, on one 

level, is rap music that inten-
tionally doesn’t make conven-

tional sense. It’s defined by 
punchlines that don’t quite hit, 
or non-sequitur bars or dated 
references or just straight-up 
gibberish. My favorite Curat-
ed Nonsensical rapper ever 
is Young Thug. Thugger is by 
far the biggest and most main-
stream of the above list. He is 
the biggest rapper to ever not 
make any sense. This is impor-
tant, generational, and I think 
has something to do with the 
internet and all the fucked-
up, senseless shit going on in 
the world right now. He isn’t, 
however, the first rapper to not 
make any sense. Thugger, con-
sciously or not, is just the new-
est member of a lineage that 
at least includes Bay Area leg-
ends Mac Dre and Andre Niki-
tina, and contemporaries like 
Das Racist, Lil B and Riff Raff. 
Thugger also, if you need any 
more evidence of his proclivity 
for nonsense, just changed his 
rap name to “No, My Name is 
Jeffery.”

You might say that curated 

nonsense is a ridiculous way to 
describe anything, let alone rap 
music, and I’ll admit, it’s a bit 
contradictory, even oxymoron-
ic. But Big Sean is little and Lil 
John is old; music is laden with 
contradiction and hypocrisy, so 
why can’t my made-up subcat-
egory have a splash of the sauce?

Also, full disclosure, I think 

curated nonsense is a great 
name of a category. It rolls off 
the tongue and sounds vaguely 
intellectual, like the type of 
thing someone who also says 
“postmodern” a lot might say 
(which, for better or for worse, 
I do). But what’s most important 
about giving a name to this type 
of rap music is that it acknowl-
edges Thugger, Mac Dre, Riff 
Raff et al. as legitimate con-
tributors to the contemporary 
artistic landscape, not just a bad 
version of normal rap music. I’m 
not saying the music deserves 
an A or even a B; I’m saying it 
deserves a grade.

Parsing out good Curated 

Nonsense from bad Curated 
Nonsense is no easy task, and I 
think that’s one of the reasons it 
gets lumped together with bad 
rap music.

For example, I’m listening 

to Anderson Paak as I write 
this piece. Anderson Paak is 
NOT Curated Nonsense. If any-
thing, he’s curated sense, which 
is ostensibly the goal of most 
music and doesn’t need its own 
category. Paak gets the people 
that call Curated Nonsense 
trash, excited. (Also Anderson 
Paak is just fucking dope and 
transcendent, and unquestion-
ably amazing.) To compare 
Anderson Paak to, say, Kendrick 
Lamar, might be difficult since 
they’re both great artists that 
have relatively different sounds, 
but it’s ultimately way easier 
than comparing, say, Young 
Thug to the Ying Yang Twins.

The Ying Yang Twins weren’t 

Curated Nonsense either, they 
were just nonsense. Intention 
is crucial to fit into my cat-
egory. But tracking intention 
is exponentially more difficult 
than tracking lyrics or drum 
progression. Welcome to post-
modernism (ugh). Thugger and 
the Ying Yang twins both don’t 
make any sense — they’re both 
sort of southern rappers — but 

Thugger is unquestionably bet-
ter in my mind. His nonsense 
makes sense. His voice is an 
instrument, and he’s aware of 
the fact that it’s hard to com-
prehend. Part of the joy in lis-
tening to Thugger is constantly 
having to play catch-up. It’s 
possible that Thugger’s rise to 
fame simply coincided perfectly 
with some cultural current that 
made his music more accessible 
than the Ying Yang Twins were 
in 2005, which complicates the 
comparison even more.

Comparing Kendrick to Paak 

is like comparing J-Kidd to 
Steve Nash. They do very differ-
ent things on the court, but they 
play the same position. Com-
paring Young Thug to the Ying 
Yang Twins is like comparing 
Draymond Green to Yi Jianlian.

This debate matters more 

than just giving credit to a few 
quirky rappers. The debate 
exposes the skewed way many 
people look at rap.

So much of rap listening cul-

ture is based in decoding the 
lyrics and then, and only then, 
getting to the heart of a song. 
Rap Genius, Reddit threads and 
the entire Drake ghost-writing 
fiasco are evidence of this idea. 
Curated Nonsense rap challeng-
es the assumption that, in order 
to relate to a song, we must 
understand where it came from 
and what it means. That might 
sounds simple, but in practice it 
requires a fair amount of mental 
gymnastics.

I get the rap OG narrative. 

Lyrics are really important. It’s 
not too much of a stretch to call 
rap music poetry with a beat. 
Actually, it’s not a stretch at all. 
That is exactly what rap music 
is. Ironically, though, the com-
parison to poetry shows what 
makes Curated Nonsense spe-
cial. 

We are taught in school that 

the best way to consume poetry 
is to do so without attempting 
to break its code. Poetry is just 
meant to exist in the world and 
be taken in; it can have multiple, 
conflicting and complicating 
meanings. To steal from Emily 
Dickinson, the goal of poetry 
is to “tell all the truth but tell it 
slant.” The way a poem makes 
you feel is just as important as 
the words on the page. Poems 
are interpreted, not understood. 
To argue that poetry needs to 
make sense is simultaneously 
reasonable and deeply limiting. 
Just like calling a Young Thug 
song convoluted is both reason-
able and deeply limiting.

We are left, maybe, with some 

schools of analytical thought 
that are at odds with each other. 
The pervasive rap narrative 
is: bitterly analyze, fact check 
and code break. The traditional 
poetry narrative is: don’t ana-
lyze too much, feel, introspect, 
drink Sweetwater’s coffee and 
be nostalgic. My main question 
is: Why can’t Young Thug be a 
poet?

When I listen to Young Thug 

and can only make out syllables 
and shifts in the tone and speed 
of his voice, I feel something. 
When I listen to Paak or Ken-
drick spit bars that make me 
think, I also feel something. 
Most people would feel the 
same if they got off their preten-
tious hip-hop high horse.

Final verdict: Amazing.

Nonsense is the 
new sense in rap

Does binge-watching 
help or hurt viewers?

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

I have a mixed relationship 

with binge-watching.

A fad that started with the 

release of TV shows like “24” on 
DVD in the early 2000s and was 
popularized by streaming ser-
vices like Netflix, binge-watching 
has become all the rage. Still, as 
a TV viewer, I have an up-and-
down relationship with the idea. 
On one hand, when a story is com-
pelling, it’s hard to stop myself 
from pressing play on the next 
episode. On the other, there are 
times where I wish I would take a 
step back and reflect on what I’m 
watching.

This past week, I watched the 

entire first season of Netflix’s 
“Stranger Things.” The eight epi-
sodes feature the perfect com-
bination of storytelling features 
for binge-watching: introducing 
elements of a mystery, twists and 
turns that changed the course 
of the show and a series of nasty 
cliffhangers that push you into 
the next episode. It’s a show that’s 
perfect for the Netflix model and 
is compulsively watchable. It ben-
efits from the momentum that 
watching multiple episodes at a 
time brings.

For every show I find irresist-

ibly binge-able, there’s a show I 
wish I hadn’t rushed through. 
I watched the second season of 
FX’s “Fargo” over the course of 
three days so I could include the 
show on my best-of-2015 ballot. 

As I made my way through the 
episodes, I found myself long-
ing to take a step back and just 
think about what was happen-
ing. “Fargo” tells its story in a 
way that services a week-to-week 
viewing in how in unfolds its 
character arcs and stories. But 
instead of looking at each step 
along the way, everything blend-
ed together.

Yet, with some series, it’s 

impossible to avoid watching 
them on a binge. The biggest 
example of this is “Orange Is the 
New Black.” It seems that with 
every release of a new season, 
the race is on to finish every epi-
sode before you stumble upon a 
spoiler from a friend or Twitter. 
It took me a week to work my way 
through the season, and I was still 
unable to avoid finding out about 
the key death at the end of the 
show’s fourth season. The dra-
ma’s fourth season, in particular, 
is one that would have benefited 
from taking a step back to process 
each step, as it built a story with 
strong themes and some strong 
character arcs.

Yet, binge watching is a nec-

essary part of my television diet. 
During a semester, it’s hard for 
me to keep up with more than 
a few shows at a time. During 
breaks, I take advantage of my 
time off to watch as many shows 
as I can, moving from show to 
show at a rapid pace. It’s easy to 
go from “Stranger Things,” to the 
back half of the second season of 
“unREAL,” to “BoJack Horse-

man,” to working through “The 
Get Down” in the span of a few 
weeks. It’s how I can get to even 
a tenth of the massive amount of 
scripted shows out there.

Ultimately, my issues with 

binge watching could just come 
from a lack of self-control. (What’s 
to stop me from taking a break 
between episodes?) But, with so 
many spoilers out there and hav-
ing the next episode right there 
ready to play, it’s hard to avoid 
just powering through a season’s 
episodes. The TV industry is 
slowly changing to encourage this 
type of viewing. This is not only 
because of Netflix’s success with 
the model but also because of how 
networks are starting to push for 
the rights to stream every episode 
of a season during a show’s run in 
an effort to encourage viewers to 
catch up quickly.

But, the question remains: 

does binge-watching hurt the 
television I watch? The answer 
seems to be a mix of yes and no. 
For series like “Stranger Things” 
or “24,” it enhanced the momen-
tum of the storytelling to see it 
without breaks or something 
separating it. For “Orange Is the 
New Black” or “Fargo,” a little 
more space between episode 
would have been appreciated to 
sort out the shows’ deeper the-
matic development. So, there 
doesn’t seem to be a right answer 
to whether or not to binge watch, 
which only makes my feelings of 
love and hate toward the practice 
even more unclear.

“Are women funny?”
Of course, you jerk.

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

I hate hearing that women 

aren’t as funny as men.

Women 
make 
me 
laugh 

every day. My mom, my sis-
ter, my best friend, my favor-
ite Twitter accounts and my 
favorite authors are all funny 
women. The shows I’ve been 
binge-watching on Netflix all 
summer are female-driven TV 
shows, helmed by strong, funny 
women. I love “How I Met Your 
Mother” and “The Office,” but I 
also love “The Mindy Project,” 
“30 Rock,” “Girls” and “Jane the 
Virgin.”

So don’t tell me that women 

aren’t funny. Don’t discredit the 
work of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, 
Lena Dunham, Mindy Kaling, 
half the cast of SNL, the cast 
of “Bridesmaids,” every female 
screenwriter and showrunner 
who creates the funny male 
characters you love. I could 
go on, but I’m not going to (for 
now).

Women are funny, and I love 

female writers and female-driv-
en TV, but I can’t help but notice 
a difference in my own prefer-
ence when it comes to stand-up 
comedy. At this point, Netflix 
knows what I like: Bo Burnham, 
John Mulaney, Louis CK, etc. 
Netflix is smart enough to rec-
ommend “Shows With Strong 
Female Leads,” but only sug-
gests comedy specials by male 
stand-up comedians. In fact, 
there’s about one comedy spe-
cial by a female comedian for 

every five by a male comedian 
on Netflix anyway, so maybe 
I’m not the only one who feels 
this way. There just isn’t a single 
woman on the list of stand-up 
comedians I can actually say I 
watch and really enjoy.

As in every situation, I hesi-

tate to blame myself. I want 
to find female stand-up acts I 
enjoy, but every time I watch 
one, I find the comedian fits into 
one (or both) of these categories:

Somehow More Sexist Than 

Male Comedians: Sure, male 
comedians say some pretty 
awful things about women (I 
don’t like them, either). But 
when women do it, it just feels 
like, come on girl. Let’s at least 
be on our own side. If you have 
to resort to making fun of your 
own gender — our helplessness, 
our sluttiness, our appearances 
— how funny are you really? 
These comedians recycle the 
same topics: gynecologists, mas-
turbation, being old and unmar-
ried. It feels like I’ve heard it 
before, and it all just feels a little 
misogynistic.

Just Gross: This one isn’t just 

for women either. Joking about 
something like abortion, anal 
sex or STDs gives an act shock 
value, which makes these topics 
a really easy way for comedi-
ans of any gender to get a laugh 
out of their audience. But it just 
feels like cheating. I get it, a lot 
of comedy is really vulgar, and 
maybe that’s just not my thing. 
It feels like a crutch used by 
comedians who aren’t funny 
enough to get a laugh the hard 

way. One of my favorite stand-
up comedians is John Mulaney 
(“The Comeback Kid”), not just 
because he’s funny, but because 
he’s funny without resorting to 
the shocking. It’s situational, 
observational comedy, and that 
takes more talent than telling 
dick jokes.

One of my least favorite 

stand-up acts is Amy Schum-
er. I like her on Twitter and 
in “Trainwreck,” but as much 
as I want to like her stand-up 
routines, I just don’t. Her jokes 
are 
almost 
constantly 
self-

deprecating. She says she’s fat; 
she says she’s loose; she says 
she’s a drunk. She mocks her-
self and her gender and even 
when she does make me laugh, 
I find myself asking, why is this 
funny? It’s cheap humor that 
relies on the taboo.

I admire funny women. I want 

to watch female comedians per-
form stand-up and I want them 
to make me laugh until I can’t 
breathe and I want the jokes to 
be about something other than 
getting a pap smear or giving a 
blow job. I’m just asking female 
comedians to be better. But this 
relies on audience response, too. 
So now I’m looking at you, audi-
ence: don’t only think women 
are funny when they’re making 
fun of women. Don’t only think 
women are funny when their 
comedy is crude. Don’t only 
think men are funny when their 
comedy is crude either. Respond 
to smart humor. Respect women. 
Respect yourself. Demand bet-
ter stand-up comedy.

TV NOTEBOOK

California MC still 
haunted on new EP 

‘Prima Donna’

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Vince Staples has never been 

one for linearity. He can jump 
between 
dejected 
soul 
and 

inspirational 
activist, 
often 

within 
the 

same 
track, 

even the same 
line. 
Density 

and expression 
are far more 
important than 
moving 
from 

point A to point 
B – a double-
edged sword that Staples has 
wielded skillfully in releases 
past and now present.

This was clear on the closing 

track of Staples’ masterful debut 
album Summertime ’06, stating 
“Next time on Poppy Street…” 
and cutting off not 45 seconds 
into the track. The effect keeps 
us on edge, ready for what’s 
around the corner, an allusion to 
the frenzied and dangerous life 
on the Long Beach streets that 
Staples portrays. Never mind 
that the teaser never material-
izes in full on Prima Donna; Sta-
ples continues where he was cut 
off with a claustrophobic atmo-
sphere and vigor to match that 
of his debut.

For those even vaguely famil-

iar with Staples, Prima Donna 
will play as immediately famil-
iar. The production, though this 
time handled by a wider scope 

of producers (including Brit-
ish electronic artist and singer 
James Blake), fits squarely with-
in the scope of Summertime ’06. 
Even the track titles can cause 
chronological confusion: Was is 
“Loca” or “Loco” which was on 
Summertime? Haven’t I heard 
this line before?

While some artists can be 

dragged by redundancy with 
this kind of repetition, Staples 
manages to use it to further his 
politically charged work. That it 
becomes difficult to distinguish 
musically between his work 
today, a year ago or two years 
ago rehashes Staples’s protest: 
the police brutality and systemic 
racism he dealt with then hasn’t 
changed so much today.

Perhaps it has even gotten 

worse. The most noticeable pro-
gression on Prima Donna is in 
Staples’s tone, which can sound 
more downtrodden and dystop-
ic than anything he’s released 
before. The EP opens with a 
croaking spoken word segment, 
simply repeating “I’m gonna let 
it shine” over and over, distant, 
like a man sitting in a dark corner 
cupping a fledgling flame. And 
then, “Crack!”, we’re shot into 
the first legitimate track, “War 
Ready” — on first listen the jolt 
can actually frighten you. Sta-
ples is apt at capturing his audi-
ence’s attention with these kind 
of musical breaks, intruding on 
silence and moments of lull with 
loud noises and sudden transi-
tions, forcing you to pay closer 
attention and disallowing casual 
listening. The third Andre 3000 
verse from “ATLiens” is sampled 
to start the track, and his words 
from 1995 are eerily in line with 
those from Staples, nearly 20 

years later. 

The jump between downtrod-

den and optimistic that Staples 
uses liberally is clearest on the 
transition between that first full 
track “War Ready” and the next, 
“Smile,” an upbeat, guitar driv-
en anthem. He acknowledges 
the distress voiced just before, 
but looks up and tells the world 
– and himself – “… when life gets 
hard / And you just think / You 
wanna end it all / Smile for me.”

Prima Donna also finds Sta-

ples experimenting with differ-
ent flows and rhythms, clearest 
on closing track “Big Time,” a 
testosterone-fueled gang boast 
produced by James Blake. He 
stretches his voice to a higher 
pitch and bites the pulsing beat, 
similar to Detroit rapper Danny 
Brown’s cadence. It’s one of his 
most successful street anthems 
to date, and one of his most 
adventurous. The beat could 
easily drown out less consuming 
rappers, but Staples controls it, 
making it bow to him.

And again, this release ends 

with a teaser: “Next time on 
Poppy Street… .” This glimpse is 
far darker than the last though, 
with rainfall in the background 
and a scared voice asking “Hello, 
is anybody there?” Whether 
these teasers somehow mate-
rialize onto Staples sophomore 
LP or not, the message is clear — 
there’s no time to wait.

The Michigan football team’s season opener lived up to the 
enormous hype, as the Wolverines trounced Hawaii, 63-3. Next 
up is a Central Florida team that finished 0-12 last year and has 
already snapped that skid. The Knights will be another tune-up 
for a Michigan team facing several injury questions. It would take 
a few more to put these teams on a level field.

Michigan welcomes rebuilding 
Central Florida to Ann Arbor

Speight, defense look 
to repeat impressive 

opening-week 
performances

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

Though it may be the first-ever 

meeting between Central Florida 
(1-0) and No. 5 Michigan, nothing 
too unexpected 
is 
anticipated 

for 
Saturday’s 

matchup 
at 

Michigan 
Stadium. 

In 
the 

Wolverines’ 
second straight 
home 
game, 

they will likely 
have 
another 

field day against 
the 
Knights. 

Michigan 
bulldozed Hawaii, 63-3, and Central 
Florida isn’t much better. Last 
season, the Knights went winless, 
finishing 0-12. 

Though Central Florida is off 

to a much better season already — 
defeating its Mid-Eastern Athletic 
Conference 
opponent 
South 

Carolina State, 38-0, last week — it 
has a rough road ahead.

 Knights quarterback Justin 

Holman went 14-for-28 against 
the Bulldogs, despite a lack of 
defensive pressure. Last season, 
Holman finished the season with a 
50.8 completion 
percentage, 
so 

he’ll 
have 
his 

hands full with 
Michigan’s 
deep secondary. 
Senior 
safety 

Delano 
Hill 

recorded 
a 

27-yard pick-six 
in 
the 
second 

quarter 
against 

Hawaii, but the defensive onslaught 
didn’t end there. Senior cornerback 
Channing Stribling added another 
score in the third quarter by 
returning an interception 51 yards 
to the house.

 This all happened without 

All-American senior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis, who Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh indicated was 
injured prior to the Hawaii game. 
Rather than potentially worsen the 
injury, Lewis sat out, but he should 
be back against Central Florida. 

 Redshirt junior linebacker Mike 

McCray will also be pressuring 
Holman. McCray was named the 
Big Ten Defensive Player of the 
Week after recording 3.5 tackles for 
loss, including two sacks. 

 “He was good,” Harbaugh said 

Monday. “Outstanding tackles for 
loss, tackles, sacks, pressures. He 
was our defensive most valuable 
player of the game. Got the most 
helmet stickers — another indication 
of really good play. And he’s been 
consistently 
good 
all 
through 

training camp, spring practice. Top 
performer on defense for us.”

 Fifth-year senior running back 

Drake Johnson also sat out with an 
undisclosed injury, while redshirt 
sophomore defensive tackle Bryan 
Mone and defensive end Taco 
Charlton had to leave the game 
due to injury. Though it is unclear 
whether or not Johnson, Mone 
or Charlton will return against 
Central Florida — Harbaugh said 
he doesn’t expect the latter two 
back — Michigan will have plenty of 
freshmen to lean on. 

 Freshman running back Chris 

Evans proved he could be a capable 
contributor this season when he ran 
for 112 yards and two touchdowns, 
leading 
the 
team 
in 
rushing 

yards. Freshman defensive end 
Rashan Gary can also step in for 
Charlton and freshman defensive 

tackle 
Michael 

Dwumfour 
can 

help fill the void 
left by Mone.

 It seems that 

the 
Knights’ 

biggest offensive 
threat 
will 

come 
from 

kicker Matthew 
Wright, 
who 

went 4-for-4 on 

field goal attempts, hitting two from 
45 yards and beyond. 

If Holman can hold up against 

the 
secondary, 
wide 
receiver 

Tre’Quan Smith may also be able 
to snag a few catches for Central 
Florida. The 2015 All-American 

Conference Rookie of the Year 
caught four passes for 65 yards 
and a touchdown against South 
Carolina State and was the leading 
receiver on the team last season 
with 724 receiving yards. 

Michigan fans will also get 

another look at new starting 
quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight, 

though it’s unlikely that they’ll 
learn much more from this game. 
Speight went on to finish 10-for-13 
against Hawaii after opening with 
an interception, proving that he can 
be cool in stressful situations, but 
observers didn’t discover much else 
about him. 

“I was real happy with the way 

he played,” said passing coordinator 
Jedd Fisch on Wednesday. “I don’t 
think you could have asked for 
too much better. We missed three 
throws out of the 13 we attempted. 
… Threw some beautiful balls. Hit, 
I think, 11 different receivers or 
something to that effect. Played 
smart, played good.”

Speight will get another chance 

to show what he can do this 
weekend, but it’s more likely that 
we’ll discover more about the 
backup quarterbacks and the rest of 
the second team.

ONLY IN HARRISON

Max Bultman, Managing Sports Editor

In April, Jourdan 

Lewis spent a weekend 

in a town he won’t 

soon forget

HARRISON, 
Mich. 
— 
When 

Tucker and Tyler Vasher’s large 
gray van pulled into the Dairy 
Queen, they could see the employees 
inside buzzing.

In the car was perhaps the most 

famous athlete to visit Harrison 
in recent memory, and word had 
spread. Jourdan Lewis only has so 
many spare weekends, and yet here 
he was, in a two-stoplight town 
with a population of just about 
2,100, pulling into a Dairy Queen in 
late April.

“We can see them inside the little 

building and they’re just freaking 
out, jumping up and down,” Tucker 
Vasher said. “So we pull up, and 
Jourdan’s sitting (behind) me, and 
I’m like, ‘Dude, you gotta get up, 
you’ve gotta say something to these 

guys.’ ”

Lewis obliged and took photos 

with them, but he wasn’t there to 
meet the kind folks of Dairy Queen. 
He was there for the Vashers.

On the surface, it’s hard to 

identify what connects them. Lewis 
is an All-American cornerback, one 
of the nation’s elite athletes who 
will almost certainly be a high pick 
in next April’s NFL Draft. Tucker 
and Tyler are 21-year-old twins 
with 
osteogenesis 
imperfecta, 

commonly known as Brittle Bone 
disease, who are confined by their 
fragility to electric wheelchairs.

Months earlier, Lewis had begun 

talking to the Vashers after Tucker 
tweeted him to say what a big fan 
he was. They started playing Xbox 
together online, some Madden and 
some NBA 2K, and soon they were 
playing semi-regularly. Now, Lewis 
was coming to visit.

Lewis does not remember ever 

breaking a bone. The Vashers 
estimate that they have broken 
hundreds. Once, Tucker broke his 
arm picking up a cup of soda at 

McDonald’s. They used to avoid 
watching scary movies for fear of 
scenes that might make them jump. 
When they sneeze, the best they 
can do is hope that nothing breaks.

Lewis is a Detroit native who 

now lives in a bustling college town. 
The Vashers live in Harrison, a city 
so small you could fit its entire 
population in Michigan Stadium 
50 times over. Driving there from 
Ann Arbor, you see the first sign 
for the city right about the same 
time you see your first horse and 
buggy. 
One-hundred-fifty-eight 

miles northeast of Ann Arbor, it’s 
one of those Michigan cities that 
sits comfortably under the umbrella 
name “up north.”

Tucker and Tyler love to tweet 

and meet famous athletes. Just 
scroll through their feeds and you’ll 
notice all of the athletes they reach 
out to. Mike Trout. Antonio Brown. 
Justin Verlander. The list goes on.

In their living room, they have 

a signed bat from Trout. They’ve 
been invited to games as guests of 
Verlander and Ndamukong Suh. 

They’re sports fans who actually 
get to meet their sports heroes. It’s 
kind of their thing.

And given their situation, it makes 

sense that athletes like Verlander, 
Suh and Trout have acknowledged 
the twins. Who doesn’t love a good 
inspirational story?

But to lump Lewis in with those 

players would be a mistake. Those 
players have each given things to the 
Vashers, not the least of which was 
simply recognizing their existence, but 
none of them actually came and spent a 
weekend in Harrison. Lewis did.

As they sat in the drive-through, 

Lewis took pictures with fans he 
didn’t know he had in a place he had 
never been to. He was asked if this 
happened to him all the time in Ann 
Arbor.

“Only in Harrison,” he said.

***

It was Saturday, April 23, when 

Lewis came to visit.

Tucker 
had 
a 
doctor’s 

appointment, so Tyler went to Ann 

Arbor with two friends to pick 
up Lewis. This was at the end of 
the academic year, before 7-on-7 
started, and it was a rare weekend 
off. It meant going to stay with a 
family he had only met once — when 
he visited Tucker after one of his 
surgeries in Ann Arbor.

But there was something about 

their invitation that drew him in.

“They just felt like really real 

people,” he said. “They weren’t 
hiding 
anything 
from 
me. 

They’re really honest and told me 
everything about Harrison. It was 
just like, ‘Why not?’ ”

On the drive up, Lewis says, his 

hosts talked about all the things 
they wanted to show him when they 
arrived. Harrison is the epitome of 
small-town life. Its claims to fame 
are its “20 lakes in 20 minutes,” and 
the Clare County Fair. So their list 
of activities wasn’t a typical set of 
tourist attractions.

They hit golf balls with baseball 

bats. They played NBA 2K. (And, 
they say, Lewis insisted they play 
on “Hall of Fame” difficulty). They

played live basketball, too.

When Lewis showed them how 

to dunk, the Vashers could not 
even attempt it. But while their 
obvious differences could have 
drawn a dividing line, Lewis saw a 
connecting one.

“The way they go about life,” 

Lewis said. “They don’t think about 
(their 
limitations). 
They 
don’t 

think about any repercussions of 
what they want to do, they just go 
out there and they do it. And that’s 
honestly what you have to have 
to play football, and that’s what 
they have to have to go about their 
everyday life.”

Tucker loves to fish, but he also 

vividly remembers breaking his 
arm while fishing and getting the 
bone cut down as a result. And then 
there’s the time he says he broke 
both arms, both legs and a femur 
when he fell out of his wheelchair 

into an old firepit. His friend, Reed, 
had to save him from being crushed 
by the chair.

Tyler is a little bigger, his arms 

aren’t quite as crooked and he’s 
stronger than his brother. But these 
are all relative terms.

But in this little slice of small-

town Michigan, they make their 
own fun. They live on a lake, though 
it’s a different house than the one 
they lived at when Lewis visited. 
They move around this town often 
— their mother is a real estate 
agent — and yet their place within 
it seems to remain the same. It’s not 
hard to see the appeal.

“I was talking about, it would 

be cool if I went out there and just 
lived out there,” Lewis said.

***

April 23 was also prom night in 

Harrison, a night that usually means 
dresses, dancing and dinners.

But Jourdan Lewis was in town 

for this prom night and, again, word 
travels fast.

“Before he came over, I was 

gonna say, ‘Watch how many of our 
“friends” come around,’ ” Tucker 
said. “(And say) ‘Oh, hey man, I 
haven’t talked to you in a while. Oh 
by the way, I heard Jourdan Lewis 
is coming over!’ ”

Sure enough, they came, dressed 

for prom but stopping by to meet 
Lewis.

“It 
was 
crazy,” 
Lewis 
said. 

“Usually you go out to dinner or 
something like that, you go hang 
out with your friends. You don’t go 
see like an athlete or anything like 
that.”

But while the rest of Harrison 

was treating him like a celebrity, 
Lewis appreciated that the Vashers 

let him experience their world. He 
liked spending a day in a community 
like that. The fact they invited him, 
he says, is how he knew they were 
more than fans.

“When they let me come up there, 

honestly, and see how they lived,” 
he said. “They treated me like I 
was part of their family. It was so 
special to see they didn’t treat me 
any (more special) than they would 
treat Reed or anything like that. It 
was just a great feeling to know I 
was just part of their family.”

That’s how Lewis wanted them 

to think of him, too — like a regular 
guy.

Lewis has earned a reputation 

as somewhat of an ambassador for 
Detroit. When an NCAA ruling 
on 
satellite 
camps 
jeopardized 

scouting at the local Sound Mind 
Sound Body camp, Lewis took 
to Twitter to publicly express 

his discontent. He occasionally 
sounds off on social issues, too. 
He comes from one of the nation’s 
most storied cities and now lives 
in one of America’s most revered 
college towns, and that makes his 
reaction to Harrison all the more 
noteworthy.

“It was just an environment of 

just pure joy and happiness,” Lewis 
said. “It was just so much fun. It 
was never a down moment when I 
was there. It was just so much fun 
every second I was there. It was 
just something that you had to 
experience, honestly.”

That Saturday night, around the 

bonfire, Vasher recalls Lewis video 
chatting with De’Veon Smith.

Smith 
wanted 
to 
know 
if 

Harrison really was that cool.

“Yeah 
man,” 
Vasher 
recalls 

Lewis saying. “We’ve gotta bring 
you up here sometime.”

UCF Q&A with the Knight News

Knights come into 
Michigan Stadium 
with new coach, 
higher intensity

By MICHIGAN DAILY STAFF 

Central Florida pays its first 

visit to Michigan Stadium on 
Saturday for a noon kickoff. 
Football writer Tyler Graddy from 
UCF’s student newspaper, Knight 
News, took some time to shed 
insight on Michigan’s unfamiliar 
opponent this weekend.

The Michigan Daily: What’s 

been your impression of Scott 
Frost so far and the impact he’s 
had on the program?

Knight News: Scott Frost 

has completely recharged the 
atmosphere 
surrounding 
UCF 

Football. The level of excitement 
around the program is at the 
highest levels since the Fiesta 
Bowl, and players have all talked 
about how grateful they are for 
the changes made. Practices are 
more intense and up-tempo with 
music constantly playing, and 
players are no longer playing 
scared.

Recruiting 
has 
seen 
a 

significant bump as well. The 
program has been more relevant 
on social media, more aggressive 
in involving recruits and more 
approachable with a coach less 
known for his traditional brand of 
old-school, no-nonsense football 
and 
much 
more 
concerned 

with creating a player-friendly 
environment.

TMD: Where have you seen 

the biggest difference in the team 
from last year?

KN: The conditioning. Frost’s 

brand of UCFast football requires 
constant hustle and it showed in 
the home opener against South 
Carolina State. Both sides of the 
ball still have kinks to work out in 
their respective systems, but the 
Knights had plenty in the tank 
all game. Summer practices were 
structured to simulate longer and 
more intensive physical efforts 
than a game ever will, though the 
mental game still is in its infancy.

As for the players themselves? 

The Knights look like they’re 
having fun playing football again. 
Last year every game seemed 
almost like a burden for the 
winless squad.

TMD: Finishing 0-12 last year 

had to have been humbling for 
UCF. What do you think are the 
team’s expectations for this year 
after that?

KN: To be sure, expectations 

have been tempered after winning 
a share of the conference title in 
2014 and then not winning a game 
in 2015. These players have done a 
remarkable job dropping the aura 
of that haunting season, however, 
and the expectation is for the 
program to return to winning 
ways this season.

That being said, Frost has 

emphasized that he and the 
coaching staff are less concerned 
about the scoreboard every week 
and more concerned with seeing 
continuous progress.

TMD: How about for this 

week? What are the expectations 
in taking on a very tough 
Michigan team?

KN: If the Knights can at least 

execute their game plan well, I 
think the team will consider it a 
success. Most of these guys have 
never even seen a crowd like this, 
let alone played against a top-five 
program.

The talk this week was that the 

Knights are carrying confidence 
with them from a great first 
step last week, but that the most 
important thing this week is 
execution.

TMD: What weapons does 

UCF have that could potentially 
give Michigan problems?

KN: 
Quarterback 
Justin 

Holman is the lifeblood of this 
offense, but with a receiving 
corps still working to establish 
firm footing, look for the running 
game to take a central role in 
the UCF attack. Frost has four 
quick running backs that he has 

pledged to rotate in and out this 
year, keeping fresh legs in the 
game and Holman has been asked 
to run more than ever before 
during his tenure as a starter.

Eight different Knights had 

at least a single carry in the first 
week, but watch for Taj McGowan 
and Jawon Hamilton to lead the 
way.

TMD: 
How 
has 
UCF’s 

offensive line looked so far, 
heading into a game against one 
of the best defensive fronts in the 
country?

KN: To say that the line is a 

work in progress may be a bit of an 
understatement — only one senior 
on the roster has seen significant 
action headed into this season: 
Justin Rae. The unit performed 
admirably against SCSU, blocking 
to rack up almost 200 yards on 
the ground but did allow three 

sacks — to an FCS team that 
led the nation in quarterback 
takedowns last year. Michigan 
will have ample opportunities to 
get after Holman.

TMD: Do you have a prediction 

for the game?

KN: Predictions can be tricky 

even when both teams are known 
commodities, 
but 
the 
talent 

disparity will be too much for 
the Knights to handle. Michigan 
wins 59-31, but UCF covers the 
spread and leaves with a much 
better idea of where the bar needs 
to be set in order to return to the 
glory days of 2013.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. UCF

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

In October of 2013, when the 

Michigan football team scheduled 
a game against Central Florida for 
this weekend, it looked like it would 
be a tough non-conference test.

Then quarterbacked by future 

No. 3 overall pick Blake Bortles, 
the Knights rolled to a 12-1 season, 
an American Athletic Conference 
championship and a victory against 
Baylor in the Fiesta Bowl. After they 
lost Bortles, they still managed to 
win nine games in 2014.

But last year, the wheels fell 

off the proverbial wagon as coach 
George O’Leary retired midseason 
and UCF finished 0-12.

Oregon offensive coordinator 

Scott Frost arrived to take over the 
program, and though early results 
are promising — a 38-0 win against 
South Carolina State last week 
snapped the skid — the Knights 
are still in the middle of a rebuild. 
Here’s how they match up with the 
Wolverines for Saturday’s noon 
kickoff at Michigan Stadium:

Michigan rush offense vs. UCF 
rush defense

The Wolverines ran the ball at 

will last weekend against Hawaii, 
racking up 306 yards at a rate of 7.8 
per carry. They can fire a series of 
running backs at UCF, including 
senior De’Veon Smith, freshman 
Chris 
Evans, 
redshirt 
junior 

Ty Isaac and sophomore Karan 
Higdon.

Smith injured his ribs on his fifth 

carry of the game Saturday and only 
touched the ball once more after 
the three-minute mark of the first 
quarter. But coach Jim Harbaugh 
expects Smith to be good to go 
Saturday. Evans stepped in and led 
the team in rushing with 112 yards on 
eight carries with two touchdowns. 
Isaac chipped in 52 yards on nine 
carries. On the outside, fifth-year 
senior wide receiver Jehu Chesson 
and freshman wide receiver Eddie 
McDoom add speed.

Michigan 
started 
sophomore 

Grant Newsome at left tackle after 
a long battle through camp and was 
only missing fifth-year senior left 
guard Ben Braden, who sat out as 
a precaution but also should return 
Saturday. If he does, the Wolverines 
will be back to full strength and 
have a sizable advantage against the 
Knights’ 3-4 front.

UCF returns most of its team 

from last year but does lose three 
starters and one reserve from the 
defensive line. Nose guard Jamiyus 
Pittman is the biggest threat up 
front, with seven tackles for loss 
and 4.5 sacks last year. The Knights 
bring back all of their linebackers 
except, notably, leading tackler 
Domenic Spencer (104 stops, 9.5 for 
loss). They limited South Carolina 
State to 85 rushing yards last week, 
but they’ll be overmatched at 
Michigan Stadium.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan pass offense vs. UCF 
pass defense

Redshirt sophomore quarterback 

Wilton Speight recovered from 
an early interception to turn in an 
impressive first showing, finishing 
10-for-13 for 145 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
The 
interception 

notwithstanding, Speight showed 
why he won the starting job, with 
poise in the pocket and the ability 
to roll out. He didn’t attempt many 
long throws downfield, but passing 
game 
coordinator 
Jedd 
Fisch 

admitted that, in a 63-3 blowout, the 
Wolverines didn’t see much benefit 
in doing so.

Speight also appears to have 

a deep cast of receivers at his 
disposal, 
perhaps 
even 
deeper 

than last year. They include wide 
receivers, tight ends, running backs 
and fullbacks, and all options are 
available Saturday.

UCF’s secondary, meanwhile, 

continues to rebuild after losing all 
four starters to the NFL heading 
into last season. Though the Knights 
suffered from those departures in 
2015, they appear improved. Still, 
they haven’t faced an opponent of 
Michigan’s caliber in a while.

Edge: Michigan

UCF rush offense vs. Michigan 
rush defense

The 
Knights 
have 
adopted 

Frost’s up-tempo spread attack 
from Oregon, where he enjoyed 
success with it. They ran 91 plays in 
32:22 against South Carolina State, 
or one every 21.3 seconds. Michigan 
had trouble with a similar tempo 
last season at Indiana, but UCF’s 
offense is still a work in progress.

The Knights rushed 55 times in 

their season opener but struggled 
to pile up yardage, managing just 
3.6 yards per carry. Their leading 

rusher was true freshman Jawon 
Hamilton with 53 yards, followed 
by Taj McGowan with 48 and 
quarterback Justin Holman with 
40. On the line, UCF shuffled 
personnel often last year, trying 
eight different combinations of 
starters. That’s not typically a recipe 
for success against Michigan’s front 
seven.

The Wolverines ambushed Hawaii 

with 10 tackles for loss Saturday, and 
they could record more this week, 
depending on who plays. The only 
question is depth. Redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst 
is still recovering from an injury, 
and senior end Taco Charlton and 
redshirt sophomore tackle Bryan 
Mone are unlikely to play after they 
suffered injuries last week.

Even if none of them play, 

Michigan could still trot out a 
starting group of Chris Wormley, 
Rashan Gary, Ryan Glasgow and 
Matt Godin. Behind them, the all-
new starting linebacker corps of Ben 
Gedeon, Mike McCray and Jabrill 
Peppers also gave Hawaii problems 
last week. The only potential issue 
for the Wolverines is fatigue against 
a no-huddle offense, but if they 
capitalize on their advantages, 
they might not be on the field long 
enough for it to matter.

Edge: Michigan

UCF pass offense vs. Michigan 
pass defense

Holman struggled along with 

the team last year, throwing 14 
interceptions against just seven 
touchdowns. He’s back and healthy 
this year, though, and seems to have 
picked up Frost’s new offense. He 
completed 14 of 28 passes against 
South Carolina State for 193 yards 
and two touchdowns, though the 
50-percent completion rate doesn’t 
bode well for his chances against 
Michigan’s defense Saturday.

Holman’s top target is wide 

receiver Tre’Quan Smith, who 
totaled 724 yards last year and 
added 65 last week. If Michigan 
senior cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
returns this week, he should draw 
Smith.

Lewis would also bolster a ball-

hawking secondary that already 
started four seniors without him 
last 
week. 
Channing 
Stribling 

and Delano Hill each returned 
interceptions 
for 
touchdowns 

to provide the highlights for the 
season opener, but the Wolverines 

were dominant for most of the 
afternoon.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Michigan 
fifth-year 
senior 

Kenny Allen performed all three 
kicking duties in the season opener 
— sort of.

Allen was the starting field-goal 

kicker and kickoff specialist, but for 
the fourth time in program history, 
Michigan did not punt. If one such 
situation arises Saturday, Allen 
will handle that, too. He didn’t 
have to attempt any field goals last 
weekend, only converting five extra 
points. So we haven’t seen him do 
much, but his track record from last 
year is positive.

The Wolverines also didn’t have 

many chances in the return game, 
but Peppers is a threat to score 
every time he touches the ball. 
Expect UCF to kick away from him 
whenever possible, as Hawaii did.

The Knights were strong on 

special 
teams 
against 
South 

Carolina State. Matthew Wright 
converted field goals of 46, 34, 45 and 
37 yards. Caleb Houston averaged 
44.7 yards on three punts. Chris 
Johnson had a couple of good punt 

returns, and Tristan Payton added 
a 47-yard kick return. We’ll see how 
many of those opportunities are 
available Saturday.

Edge: Push

Intangibles

UCF’s first win since 2014 had 

to be a motivating factor, and 
the Knights should be fired up to 
test themselves against a top-five 
team. But many of their players 
have never played anywhere that’s 
even close to matching Michigan 
Stadium’s size, and if they need time 
to adjust, the game could get out of 
hand early.

The 
Wolverines, 
meanwhile, 

should brush off another lesser 
opponent, but if the past is any 
indication, they won’t be uninspired. 
The defensive players, especially, 
have spoken about finishing the job 
this week and getting the shutout 
that eluded them last week. Though 
Frost may have some tricks in 
mind to put points on the board, 
Michigan should deliver another 
strong performance at home.

Edge: Michigan

Prediction: Michigan 55, UCF 7

Freshman Rashan Gary could make his first career start in Taco Charlton’s absence.

What to Watch: Injuries, backups

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

After jumping into the top five 

of the Associated Press poll for the 
first time since before the 2007 
season, the No. 5 Michigan football 
team will be a heavy favorite for the 
second straight week at Michigan 
Stadium, this time taking on 
Central Florida.

The Knights (1-0) did pick up a 

38-0 win over South Carolina State 
in their season opener, but they are 
coming off a winless 2015 campaign 
with an average margin of defeat 
of 23.8 points. If all goes well for 
the 
Wolverines, 
this 
weekend 

should be just another chance to 
experiment in preparation for the 
Big Ten season, as well as another 
opportunity to give plenty of 
freshmen and backups playing time.

Even if Michigan pulls off 

another blowout, here are a few 
things to watch for on Saturday.

1. Who’s still hurt, who’s not and 

who fills in?

The 
one 
downside 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ 63-3 rout of Hawaii 
last week was the growing number 
of injuries the team suffered, both 
before the game and during it. 
Senior cornerback Jourdan Lewis, 
fifth-year senior offensive lineman 
Ben Braden and redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst all 
could return this week after being 
held out by Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh as a precaution last week, 
and senior running back De’Veon 
Smith should be back in the starting 
lineup after leaving the Hawaii 
game with banged-up ribs.

However, the Wolverines will 

likely be missing fifth-year senior 
running 
back 
Drake 
Johnson, 

redshirt 
sophomore 
linebacker 

Noah Furbush, senior defensive 
end Taco Charlton and redshirt 
sophomore defensive tackle Bryan 
Mone. Johnson and Furbush didn’t 
dress last week, and Charlton and 
Mone both left the game with lower 
body injuries and aren’t expected to 
return Saturday.

Keep 
an 
eye 
on 
freshman 

defensive linemen like Rashan 
Gary, Michael Dwumfour and even 
offensive lineman Michael Onwenu 
(who played both sides of the ball 
last week). All three might be called 
upon to help fill out defensive line 
coach 
Greg 
Mattison’s 
typical 

eight-man rotation. As for the 
linebackers, expect the Wolverines 

to get creative behind their locked-
in starters (seniors Ben Gedeon 
and Mike McCray and redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers) — even 
redshirt 
sophomore 
cornerback 

Brandon 
Watson 
has 
been 

mentioned as a potential fill-in at 
the position.

2. Which quarterback will 

emerge as the more deserving 

backup?

Redshirt 
sophomore 
Wilton 

Speight pretty much controlled 
Michigan’s 
quarterback 

competition from start to finish, 
but his backups have come a long 
way as well. Redshirt juniors 
John O’Korn and Shane Morris 
each entered the game and led 
touchdown drives last week after 
the score got out of hand, and 
neither threw an incomplete pass 
in his limited time on the field.

O’Korn figures to have the 

edge for backup duty right now, 
especially given his proven mobility 
in the pocket, but Morris showed 
some athleticism as well with a 
14-yard red-zone scramble last 

week. Harbaugh has hinted that 
the backup competition was still 
ongoing, so the two quarterbacks 
will want to be ready to show what 
they can do with another inferior 
opponent on deck.

3. Can the Wolverines’ 

secondary keep catching the 

ball?

When 
senior 
safety 
Delano 

Hill 
and 
senior 
cornerback 

Channing Stribling both returned 
interceptions 
for 
touchdowns 

against the Rainbow Warriors, they 
made history as just the fourth duo 
in Michigan history to accomplish 
the feat in the same game. This 
week may provide more gifts 
for the experienced Wolverines’ 
secondary, as UCF had the third-
highest interception rate in the 
country last year.

Add in the fact that Lewis, 

Michigan’s best all-around cover 
man, should be back this week and 
that fifth-year senior cornerback 
Jeremy Clark missed out on the fun 
last week after leading the team 
in interceptions last year, and one 

might expect the Wolverines to pull 
off some more mid-air robberies on 
Saturday.

4. Will any 1997 drama 

resurface?

In the days leading up to the 

game, much has been made of 
the fact that new UCF coach 
Scott Frost was once the starting 
quarterback at Nebraska — a team 
that infamously split the national 
championship with Michigan in 
1997. After both teams finished the 
season undefeated and didn’t play 
each other in a bowl game, Frost 
was extremely vocal in persuading 
voters to choose the Cornhuskers, 
going so far as to say, “I can’t see 
how any coach outside the Big 
Ten or the Pac-10 would vote for 
Michigan.”

Frost has since insisted that 

the past is in the past, and that his 
players will not care at all about any 
lingering conflict between him and 
the Wolverines. Harbaugh has been 
known to, as he puts it, “fire shots 
over the bow” of coaches who have 
a bone to pick with Michigan, but 

he was already playing in the NFL 
in 1997, and none of the current 
Wolverines were older than 4 when 
the controversy took place. Still, 
don’t be surprised if that narrative 
is played up numerous times during 
and after the game.
