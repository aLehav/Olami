Researchers aim to 
use new technology 
to reduce injury in 
high-contact sports

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Researchers at the University 

of Michigan are aiming to make 
progress 
toward 
encouraging 

safer equipment for athletes and 
raising awareness about common 
brain injuries that can occur 
on the field — an issue of rising 
concern in both professional and 
college sports — through new 
helmet technology.

A new sports-helmet prototype 

capable of dissipating impulse 
from impact and taking kinetic 
energy away from the skull and 
brain while playing high-contact 
sports is being developed by a team 
in the College of Engineering. 
Though helmets currently used for 
sports like football are intended 
to protect against skull and brain 
injuries, this new prototype aims 

to step beyond that with new 
understandings about how the 
brain becomes injured.

Co-author of the study Ellen 

Arruda, a professor of mechanical 
engineering, said the project 
began by looking at applying 
lightweight materials to the blast 
and impact associated with high-
contact sports.

“It’s only recently that we’ve 

understood 
traumatic 
brain 

injuries,” 
Arruda 
said. 
“The 

helmets that we’re using weren’t 
designed to protect the brain; 
they were designed to prevent 
skull fracture … Now that we 
understand that they also have 
to protect the brain, we realized 
that literature had virtually no 
information on how to go about 
doing that … no one carefully 
looked at what it would take to 
optimally reduce the force and 
impulse of an impact in a helmet 
design over and over and over 
again.”

Arruda said she and her 

colleagues specifically researched 
football and were thus well 
prepared 
to 
try 
to 
initially

More than 9,000 people 

cheered and stomped their feet 
in response to the arrival of U.S. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.) at 

Eastern Michigan University’s 
Convocation Center Monday. 

Sander’s visit was his first to 

the state of Michigan during his 
campaign and comes just three 
weeks before the Michigan 
primary on March 8. Sanders 
will return to Michigan on 
March 6 for a Democratic 
debate held in Flint.

At the Monday rally, he 

largely 
addressed 
familiar 

topics 
surrounding 
his 

campaign, many of which had 

personal connections to the 
mostly young, local crowd — 
including 
issues 
pertaining 

to Flint, higher education and 
youth voter turnout.

He also touched on recent 

events, 
referencing 
U.S. 

Supreme 
Court 
Associate 

Justice Antonin Scalia, who 
died on Saturday.

There 
is 
immense 

speculation 
about 
whom 

President Obama will choose as 
his nominee to replace Scalia, 

and 
how 
much 
resistance 

that nominee will face from 
the Republican majority in 
Congress. 
Senate 
Majority 

Leader 
Mitch 
McConnell 

(R-Ky.) said in a statement 
Saturday that he thought the 
seat shouldn’t be filled until the 
next president takes office.

Calling the GOP’s response to 

Scalia’s death an example of the 
party’s doctrine, Sanders said 
it was their chance to prove

Researcher focuses 

on Greek life in 
discussion of 

racism on campuses 
 

By SOPHIE SHERRY

For the Daily

More than 100 people filled 

the Michigan League ball-
room Monday night to hear 
author Lawrence C. Ross dis-
cuss research highlighted in his 
latest book “Blackballed: The 
Black and White Politics of Race 
on America’s Campuses.” 

The event aimed to both dis-

cuss Ross’ research and prompt 
audience members to reflect on 
how his findings regarding race 
relations on college campuses 
apply to the University of Mich-
igan, organizers said.

Courtney Monroe, council 

adviser for the Office of Greek 
Life, planned the event along 
with the Office of Multi-Eth-
nic Student Affairs and the 
Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies. Members 
of the Panhellenic Council also 
attended and lead a Q&A ses-
sion after the event. 

The event began with liba-

tions offered by Prof. Elizabeth 
James from the Department 
of Afroamerican and African 

Studies, which are given as a 
sign of respect and acknowledg-
ment for those who have passed. 
During the event, Monroe said 
she asked James to deliver these 
libations in the spirit of Black 
History Month, saying it was 
important to peacefully reflect 
and pay homage to those who 
made it possible for everyone to 
be at the lecture and at the Uni-
versity.

Ross began his lecture by 

reciting an infamous chant from 
the University of Oklahoma’s 
chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
that made national headlines 
in 2014. A video showed mem-
bers of the fraternity chanting 
“they would never let a n****r

The University of Michigan’s 

Board of Regents has released 
its agenda for its February 
meeting this Thursday in the 
Michigan Union. This week, 
the regents will hear updates 
on several investment reports 
and construction projects, and 
will discuss other reports from 
Central Student Government 
and the University community.

Construction Projects

The plant extension report 

outlined several projects that 
are currently in the planning 
stages. The most costly of those 
projects is the construction 
of the new Biological Science 
Building, funded by LSA and 
Office of the Provost resources, 
which is estimated to cost about 
$261 million.

The BSB will house the 

Department 
of 
Molecular, 

Cellular 
and 
Developmental 

Biology and the Department 
of Ecology and Evolutionary 
Biology, both of which are 
currently in the Edward Henry 
Kraus Natural Science Building.

The new facility will connect 

to the Life Sciences Institute, 
allowing for greater and easier

Disco and folk music filled 

what 
little 
space 
remained 

in 
the 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University Convocation Center. 
Having spent hours outside, 
enduring 
frigid 
temperatures 

and seemingly endless line, a 
crowd of 9,000 was chomping 
at the bit. Anxious to see their 
champion, applause broke out 
every few minutes, whether it 
was the long pause that followed 
“Disco Inferno” for no apparent 
reason or the campaign aide who 
walked out to stock the podium 
with bottled water. When it was 
finally time, after more than a 
few false starts, the applause that 
welcomed Bernie Sanders to his 
first campaign stop in Michigan 
could only be described in one 
word — thunderous. Disco and

As I scanned the crowd, 

I 
searched 
for 
common 

denominators 
between 
the 

“Grandmas 
for 
Bernie” 
and 

the college students, the young 
woman wearing a hijab in 
the fifth row and the group of 
elderly Black women who sat 
near the aisle. White and Black, 
old and young, privileged and 
poor, people of every creed 
and sexual orientation stood 
shoulder to shoulder. Together, 
they screamed and waved signs, 
stomped their feet and lifted 
their arms above their heads 
like a gospel choir at a Sunday 
mass. Regardless of the issue he 
discussed, the support was loud 
and it was unanimous. Why? 
Because Sanders supersedes the 
labels that have dominated this 
campaign cycle with the simple 
fact that he is an idealist.

The media introduces and 

perpetuates these labels until 
they are taken as gospel by the 
average 
voter. 
Establishment 

versus outsider, big money versus 
individual 
donations, 
party 

endorsements versus appeal to 
millennials are all ways in which 
the race for the Democratic 
nomination has been framed. 
But none of them captures the 
central issue of pragmatism and 
the role it plays in our politics. 
Perhaps the best example thus far 
has been the controversy over the 
term “progressive.” In response 
to doubts raised by the Sanders 
campaign 
about 
her 
liberal 

credentials, 
Hillary 
Clinton

TENTS & TABLES

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

Arts Programming Coordinator Graham Hamilton 
preps the art gallery in East Quad for the next show 
on Monday.

E YE ON ART

The Michigan Daily is 

introducing a new rotating item, 
Tents and Tables, that seeks to 
highlight campus activities on the 
Diag and near the posting wall in 
Angell Hall. 

Camp Kesem held a Chick-

Fil-A fundraiser Monday in front 
of the Mason Hall posting wall. 
The organization fundraises 
throughout the year to send 
children whose parents have 
cancer to camp during the 
summer.

LSA sophomore Katherine 

Boss, a development coordinator 
at Camp Kesem, said the 
organization tries to fundraise 
to send as many kids as they can 
to camp.

“Obviously the kids are 

affected by (their parent’s cancer) 
and so we fundraise for them all 
year to send them to camp for 
free so it’s not a financial burden 
on the family, so we can get as 
many kids as possible,” Boss said.

Boss said each counselor at 

Camp Kesem has to raise $500, 
which makes the organization’s 

overall fundraising goal 
about $110,000. She said the 
organization has thus far raised a 
little over half of that money.

Volunteers drove to Toledo, 

Ohio to get the nuggets and 
sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A at 
7:30 a.m. and spent about $230, 
so the organization is hoping to 
at least fundraise more than that 
amount of money.

Another organization in 

front of the posting wall Monday 
was Michigan Mazaa, a group 
that was founded four years ago 
that aims to raise money and 
awareness for organizations that 
help fight human trafficking in 
Southeast Asia.

Saturday, Michigan Mazaa 

will hold its annual Bollywood 
Dance Fusion competition in the 
Michigan Theatre. It spends all 
year preparing for this event.

LSA junior Rohit Agarwal, 

who is the treasurer for Michigan 
Mazaa, said representatives from 
the organization have been out in 
Angell Hall for the past week to 
sell tickets for the competition.

“This is a great place to 

market, everyone usually comes 
by the posting wall and looks at 
what we’re doing,” Agarwal said. 
“It helps not only sell tickets but 
also raise awareness for what 
we’re doing.”

Agarwal said Michigan 

Mazaa usually sells about 1,000 
tickets for the show. Many of the 
tickets are purchased online, 
but many sales also come from 
students who purchase the 
tickets at the table in front of the 
posting wall. To garner more 
attention, there is a TV next 
to the table that features clips 
from the competition. Some of 
the audience members at the 
competition are also from out of 
state because the competition 
features groups from across the 
country.

Agarwal said he hopes the 

organization is able to spread 
awareness about the problem of 
human trafficking.

that they do, in practice, follow 
the text of the Constitution.

“I say to my colleagues in 

the U.S. Senate, my Republican 
colleagues, you talk about the 
Constitution a whole lot. How 
about obeying the Constitution 
and start holding hearings 
when 
President 
Obama 

nominates the next Supreme 
Court 
Justice?” 
Sanders 

said. “Talk about cowardice, 
obstructionism. Here you have 
the Constitution clear as can 
be.”

Speaking 
more 
broadly 

during his remarks, Sanders 

said he was pleased by the 
large 
crowd 
attending 
the 

rally, noting that the issues 
he focuses on require the 
attention of everybody.

The crowd was comprised 

of residents and students from 
all over the state wanting 
to witness the candidate in 
person, including LSA senior 
Lucy Licht.

“I was really interested in 

seeing what the real-life energy 
was like,” Licht said. “I’ve 
watched Bernie on TV and read 
stuff about him but I don’t think 
I really captured the experience 
of the excitement and energy 
of everyone coming together to 
hear what he has to say.”

Sanders’ visit follows two 

separate campaign stops in 
Flint 
for 
opponent 
Hillary 

Clinton, in the race for the 
Democratic nomination — on 
Feb. 7, Clinton herself, and a 
few days later, her daughter 
Chelsea Clinton. During his 
speech, Sanders said he met 
with residents of Flint earlier 
that day but did not make any 
official 
appearances 
while 

there.

Both Sanders and Clinton 

have 
criticized 
the 
state 

government 
for 
their 
slow 

response to the Flint water 
crisis. Clinton has brought the 
issue to national attention by 
referencing it during two recent 
Democratic 
debates, 
calling 

the current efforts insufficient. 

Sanders — echoing several 
state and national groups 
who have heldprotests in 
recent weeks — has taken 
a harder stance, calling for 
the resignation of Gov. Rick 
Snyder.

During 
his 
remarks, 

Sanders said prior to his 

meeting with Flint residents 
he did not fully understand the 
gravity of the crisis.

“I really did not know how 

ugly and how horrible and how 
terrible what is going on in our 
community (is),” he said. “It is 
beyond my comprehension that 
in the year 2016, in the United 
States of America, we are 
poisoning our children.”

Sanders also touched on his 

plan for addressing student 
debt 
and 
making 
public 

colleges 
and 
universities 

tuition free. Sanders’ plan 
calls for taxes on Wall Street 
speculation — which would 
require banks to pay a fee for 
various financial transactions 
included under the umbrella of 
speculation such as stocks and 
bond trading — to finance the 
tuition-free college initiative.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Dearborn) has co-sponsored 
legislation 
that 
addresses 

the 
loan-refinancing 
issue 

Sanders calls for, though she is 
supporting Clinton in the race.

Sanders 
said 
higher 

education is key to maintaining 
a competitive economy, and 
characterized student debt as 
a “punishment” for individuals 
seeking education.

“Everybody 
knows 
that 

for our economy to be strong 
we need the best education,” 
he said. “How insane is it to 
punish people for the crime 
of trying to get an education? 
That is why as part of our 
legislation, we are going to 
allow people to refinance their 
debt with the lowest possible 
interest rates.”

Recent 
surveys 
suggest 

a 
large 
base 
of 
Sanders’ 

supporters come from younger 
generations 
— 
particularly 

those of college age. In New 
Hampshire, Sanders won 83 
percent of voters under the age 
of 30, The Atlantic reported.

Sanders 
promised 
college 

students in the room a future 
without mounting student debt 
and higher minimum wage, but 
cautioned the crowd that they 

must remain active in their 
campaigning and get friends 
and peers out to the voting 
booth.

“Your job, in every creative 

way, is to determine and make 
certain that every American 
is actively involved in shaping 
the future of our country, not 
just the 1 percent,” Sanders 
said.

Sanders also stressed that 

a 
true 
political 
revolution 

requires 
action 
from 
the 

bottom up. To take power away 
from the 1 percent — a rallying 
cry of the Sanders campaign — 
movement must come from the 
masses, he said.

“Real change never takes 

place from the top on down … 
real change takes place when 
people by the tens of millions 
look around and say you know 
what, the status quo is just no 
longer 
acceptable,” 
Sanders 

said. “It’s got to change. When 
the people lead, the leaders 
follow.”

transportation of lab supplies. 
It will include new laboratories,

of 
the

currently 
in 
the

Sports-focused 
projects 

made up a significant portion 
of the construction planning. 
These projects include $18.7

student-

athletes in track and field,

and women’s rowing teams.

New Master of Science in 

Nursing

The regents will also vote on 

the approval of a new Master 
of Science in Nursinggraduate 
program through the School of 
Nursing. The MSN will serve as a 
path to the Doctorate in Nursing 
Practice, which the report cites 
as important for preparation 
for national certification and 
licensure. It is designed for 
those who have completed a 
Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing.

The 
School 
of 
Nursing’s 

governing faculty has already 
approved the 36- to 37-credit-
hour curriculum. If the regents 
approve, enrollment may begin 
in Fall 2016.

Central Student Government

Central Student Government 

also submitted a report to the 
regents outlining several of its 
recent operations and goals.

The report includes updates 

from the Course Evaluation 
Committee, 
which 
includes 

both 
student 
and 
faculty 

representatives. 
Members 
of 

CSG and the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs have been collaborating 
to 
improve 
the 
evaluation 

instrument and create fairer 
data 
release 
policies 
and 

mechanisms.

According 
to 
the 
report, 

the 
Course 
Evaluations 

Instrument Review Committee 
has entered the final stages of 
selecting appropriate evaluation 
questions, 
and 
the 
Policy 

Committee is currently drafting 
a disclaimer to be used upon 
the release of course evaluation 
data.

CSG filed a Michigan Freedom 

of Information Act request in 
December for the University to 
release course evaluation data. 
The report expressed CSG’s 
disappointment about the delays 
in the process.

Additionally, 
the 
Faculty 

Senate’s 
Student 
Relations 

Advisory Committee recently 
voted to not recommend one 
of six CSG proposals, which 
would have allowed students to 
“formally share their feedback 
on amendments proposed by 
the Faculty Senate or Executive 
Officers.”

“We 
are 
disappointed 
in 

the Faculty’s decision to vote 
this down, as it is only fair that 
students are given the same 
opportunity to comment on 
amendment proposals that the 
faculty 
and 
administrators 

have,” CSG wrote. “Any change 
proposed to our student code 
of conduct should have ample 
opportunities to have students 
voice their opinions — and the 
SRAC’s decision to vote this 
down makes it difficult for 
students to share their thoughts 
on any proposed changes.”

The Office of General Counsel, 

along with E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, 
will now review amendment 
proposals, and the final decision 
will be made by University 
President Mark Schlissel.

develop the prototype helmet 
technology, called Mitigatium, 
for the Head Health Challenge 
III. This competition was created 
to encourage the development of 
materials that better absorb or 
dissipate harsh impact.

The prototype Arruda and 

her colleagues are developing 
has different capabilities than 
traditional 
football 
helmets 

already in use, the team said.

“It has the ability to dissipate 

impulse, or take kinetic energy 
out of the brain, (and) prevent 
it from being transferred to the 
brain,” Arruda said. “It does that 
by visco-elastically dampening 
the stress wave as it goes through 
the helmet.”

Co-author Michael Thouless, 

professor 
of 
mechanical 

engineering, 
said 
before 

beginning the prototype, the 
researchers worked together to 
look at the mechanics of impact 
and try to understand what 
aspects of the mechanics actually 
contribute to injury.

According to the NFL 2015 

injury data report released in 
January 2016, in 2015 there were a 
total of 271 concussion incidences 
in both the preseason and regular 
season, with only 37 concussive 
injuries occurring during practice 
and 234 occurring during a game. 
This report indicates that 2015 
holds the highest amount of 
concussions in the past four years. 
2014, only one year before, held 
only 206 total incidences.

At 
the 
University, 
the 

question 
of 
how 
to 
handle 

concussions in athletes gained 
significant attention over now-
former 
football 
coach 
Brady 

Hoke’s actions regarding then-
sophomore quarterback Shane 
Morris’ concussion in the Sept. 
27, 2014 game against Minnesota. 
Morris was involved in a hard 
head-on hit, yet continued to play 
despite what was later confirmed 
as a concussion.

Speculation arose that Hoke 

took the wrong steps in ensuring 
Morris’ safety and health for 
the sake of the game. Former 
University 
Athletic 
Director 

Dave Brandonspoke with the 
Daily following the incident in 
2014 to discuss the importance of 
student-athlete health. Brandon 
resigned from the University 
soon after the incident. Hoke 
told media sources that he was 
unaware of Morris’ condition 
during the game. 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
later 
also 
released 

a 
statement, 
demonstrating 

concern for the health of student 

athletes 
and 
apologized 
to 

Morris, his family and his 
teammates for the way the 
situation was handled.

The incident, among others, 

led to the Big Ten moving to 
institute independent medical 
spotters during games. 

Associate Kinesiology Prof. 

Steven Broglio said concussions 
can have a multitude of effects 
on any athlete. Broglio said 
concussions are typically seen 
as an alteration in mental 
status with or without loss 
of consciousness. He added 
that in many cases, symptoms 
include 
disorientation, 

feeling unbalanced or mental 
confusion. Because it is not 
possible to complete a CT scan, 
MRI or X-ray to determine if 
an athlete has a concussion, 
the diagnosis is purely based on 
clinical evaluation.

Oftentimes, 
Broglio 
said 

players might not report their 
injury in fear of having to leave 
the field.

“Certainly it’s an issue if (the 

athlete doesn’t) report their injury 
to a medical professional,” Broglio 
said. “Only about 10 percent of the 
(concussion) injuries result in a 
loss of consciousness, so it’s very 
easy to hide the injury if you’re an 
athlete.”

There are many cases in which 

the athlete continues to play 
during the game but reports their 
injury afterward, Broglio said. He 
said this might be because head 
injuries do not always result in 
concussions.

“(However), 
signs 
and 

symptoms can slowly develop and 
that can be anywhere from 40 
minutes after the impact to days 
after the impact,” Broglio said. 
“Certainly athletes that continue 
to play after they’re concussed, if 
they chose not to report, they are 
going to prolong their recovery 
period. If an athlete is suspected 
of the injury, then they should be 
immediately removed from play 
and then evaluated by a trained 
professional.”

However, 
this 
does 
not 

necessarily happen as sports 
become 
more 
competitive, 

Broglio said.

Researchers 
Thouless 

and Arruda found that in the 
mechanics of a concussion, there 
are two parts of a hit that matter 
in determining medical outcome: 
the force and the impulse, which 
are both developed during an 
impact.

The first trial for the prototype 

only had to meet the Head Health 
Challenge’s entry requirements, 
Arruda said. Researchers dropped 
a weight on the prototype and 
measured the rebound height of 
that weight.

The testing Arruda and her 

colleagues are doing now uses a 
cylindrical prototype, to which 
they added a skull and brain 
surrogate using materials that are 
similar in mechanical properties 
to a real skull and brain, Arruda 
said. Using the cylindrical skull 
and brain, the researchers put 
layers of helmet material around 
it and allowed the prototype to 
roll.

Researchers 
then 
filmed 

the trial to observe the speckle 
pattern, 
which 
shows 
and 

measures strain on the brain on 
the surface of the brain, and saw 
how it stretched and deformed. 
They were then able to compare 
the calculations of their helmet 
design versus existing helmet 
designs.

Arruda and her colleagues are 

one of five finalists in the Head 
Health Challenge, to which they 
will send their refined version to 
compete by the end of the year. 
She said the researchers are 
currently focusing on finding the 
best combination of materials for 
optimal performance.

However, she noted that no 

matter what the outcome of the 
competition, she believed overall 
better technology needs to be put 
into helmets. Current helmets 
are easily cracked or broken 
during high-contact sports such 
as football, and producers of the 
equipment have not yet begun to 
reduce the force and impulse of 
an impact. As a result, helmets 
would ideally be replaced more 
often. However, this solution is 
not practical in the long-term, 
Arruda said.

“You can’t just stop the game 

after every impact where the 

helmet has been fractured and 
get a new one,” Arruda said. “It’s 
not only impractical from the 
standpoint from the flow of the 
game, it’s very costly. A strategy 
like that would probably never 
make it down to the little kids 
playing football who often don’t 
have very expensive helmets.”

Thouless agreed with Arruda, 

saying football helmets are unlike 
helmets used for activities such as 
riding a bike. If a person falls off 
their bike, his or her helmet likely 
cracks to dissipate the energy 
from the fall, and is replaced 
before the next use. With football 
and other high-contact sports, 
this is a less practical system.

In addition to better quality 

helmets, Broglio said he thought 
that to resolve the issue there was 
a need for better-defined rules in 
games such as football, hockey 
and lacrosse, stricter enforcement 
of them, harsher penalties for 
violating the rules and better 
education about concussions.

However, research in the field 

on the impact of concussions — 
and therefore, how they should be 
approached — remains contested.

In a presentation in December 

2014 by Jeffrey Kutcher, the 
national director of the Sports 
Neurology 
Clinic, 
Kutcher 

addressed 
misconceptions 

about concussions, specifically 
the 
distinction 
between 
a 

concussion, 
post-concussion 

syndrome and chronic effects 
of playing sports. Kutcher was 
previously an associate professor 
of neurology at the University, 
director 
of 
the 
NeuroSport 

program and a Michigan football 
team physician.

Despite some findings, Kutcher 

said in an interview with the 
Daily on Sunday he believes 
there are many misconceptions 
about concussions even today, 
particularly an overemphasis on 
the concussion itself.

“The vast majority of these 

injuries do not result in any long-
term problems,” Kutcher said.

Rather than being a progressive 

problem, Kutcher said in many 
cases potential effects might 
include 
having 
a 
one-time 

decrease in the brain’s ability to 
form cognitive tasks.

“(Long 
term 
effects 
are) 

not about how many times 
a 
concussion 
has 
occurred,” 

Kutcher said. “More, it’s about 
how many times that brain has 
experienced force … For each 
individual, there’s going to be the 
amount of force that will become 
problematic. We don’t know what 
really sets those thresholds, those 
levels, but we do know that it’s a 
multifactorial thing.”

In 
contrast, 
an 
article 

published in the International 
Journal of Psychophysiology, of 
which Broglio was a co-author, 
observed an association between 
the 
number 
of 
concussions 

resulting in a loss of consciousness 
and greater variability of reaction 
time in various tasks.

The study noted that its 

claims support similar findings 
done in previous research that 
has 
observed 
a 
relationship 

between concussive injury and 
impairments in cognitive tasks.

However, the study added, 

“further 
research 
is 
needed 

to better address the apparent 
importance 
of 
sensory 
and 

attentional demands for detecting 
concussion related deficits.”

NAACP threatens 
mass civil 
disobedience if 
Flint infrastructure 
is not repaired

The National Association for 

the Advancement of Colored 
People, says it will recommend 
disruptive civil disobedience on 
a mass scale in Flint if Gov. Rick 
Snyder does not present a plan 
with a clear deadline for replacing 
the piping infrastructure in the 
next 30 days, the Detroit Free 
Press reported. 

Snyder recently released 

his budget recommendation 
for the upcoming fiscal year 
which allocates $195 million for 
Flint with $25 million of that 
immediately available for the 
city’s infrastructure needs.

Of Flint’s pipes there are 

approximately 5,000 known lead 
lines, 25,000 made of known and 
unharmful materials and 10,000 
pipelines of unknown material.

Cornell Brooks, national 

president of the NAACP, said he 
expects a comprehensive timeline, 
deadline and budget for replacing 
the waterlines in the city. 

The pipe’s corrosion was a 

result of the switch from Detroit 
city water to Flint River water in 
April 2014. The switched caused 
lead to contaminate the water 
resulting in reports of adverse 
health effects by residents. 

Schlissel 
recommends new 
position of VP 
for information 
technology

University President Mark 

Schlissel is recommending that 
the Univeristy create the new 
position of vice president of 
infomation technology and chief 
information officer. The Board of 
Regents will consider Schlissel’s 
recommendation Thursday, 
according to a press release.

The new information vice 

president would report directly 
to the current president and serve 
as a member of the executive 
leadership team. 

For Schlissel, this new position 

is important because the ability 
for the University to harness the 
power of information.

“To optimally position the 

University for the future this is a 
critical domain , I propose a new 
vice president of information 
tecnology,” he said. “This position 
will ensure that information 
strategy is appropriately 
considered.” 

The responsibilities of the new 

position would involve creating a 
integrated information technology 
strategy for the University across 
all colleges and campuses.

Schlissel will begin his search 

to fill the position following the 
approval by the Board of Regents.

‘U’ awarded $3 
million to move 
health intervention 
program to Chicago

The School of Public Health 

has been awarded a $3 million 
grant from the National Institute 
of Child Health and Human 
Development of the National 
Institutes of Health to be used 
over the next five years, The 
University Record reported. 

The grant will fund research 

to determine if the Fathers and 
Sons Program — an initiative to 
strengthen the father-son bond 
in order to reduce risky youth 
behaviors — can impact African-
American fathers and sons in 
Chicago. 

The program was originally 

funded by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention and saw 
successful implementation in 
Flint after partnering with several 
community based organizations. 

The parenting program 

encouraged communication 
and other factors that lead to a 
decrease in behaviors such as sex, 
violence and racial issues.

in SAE.”

Ross said he believes the way 

administrators at the University 
of Oklahoma handled the issue 
demonstrates his theory “Three 
Izes Equal A Miss.” The theory 
suggests that when large institu-
tions are accused of systemic rac-
ism they individualize, minimize 
and trivialize the issue.

Before Ross took the stage, 

Monroe 
acknowledged 
that 

reflecting on race relations at the 
University would be a difficult 
conversation to have for some stu-
dents.

Several incidents have drawn 

attention to racism at the Uni-
versity in past years. In 2013, the 
University’s chapter of Theta 
Xi planned a “Hood Ratchet” 
themed party,which resulted in 
the fraternity’s suspension. Also 
in 2013, a twitter campaign driv-
en by the #BBUM inspired social 
media users to share their expe-
riences with race and racism on 
campus.

“We accept this challenge with 

the understanding that Michigan 
has always been a place where we 
explore the realities that make us 
uncomfortable,” Monroe said.

Ross’ research has focused on 

four areas of campus racism; the 
legacy of segregation, campus 
symbolism, the Inter-Fraternal 
and Panhellenic Council and 
racial microaggressions.

Though Ross divides his book 

into four areas of racism, he said 
he believes each are interconnect-
ed and all create a sense of ostra-
cism for students of color.

Ross acknowledged that while 

the University’s campus may not 
have blatant symbols of racism, 
many campuses throughout the 
country do, citing examples rang-
ing from buildings to football sta-

diums named in honor of racist 
figures.

He noted in particular a build-

ing at Clemson University built 
and named after Benjamin Till-
man, a 19th-century governor of 
South Carolina who is known to 
have espoused racist views.

“When you still have buildings 

to this day like Tillman’s build-
ings that still stand, typically that 
building is spray painted almost 
every single day because they 
are basically saying we need 
to get rid of this,” he said. 
“Because what you are basi-
cally telling them is not only do 
you not belong there but these 
buildings, these honors reflect 
the values of the University.”

Ross is a member of the 

Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity 
and an advocate for Greek life, 
but said he discovered in his 
research that Interfraternal 
Council and Panhellenic orga-
nizations have been the source 
of the most consistent instanc-
es of racism on college cam-
puses over the past 40 years.

Many IFC and Panhel-

lenic members do not actu-
ally know what is happening in 
their communities, he added, 
so they cannot adequately 
address issues with race rela-
tions.

“This 
lecture 
is 
called 

‘Know Better, Do Better’ and 
unfortunately what typically 
happens, my IFC and Panhel 
friends do not actually know 
what’s happening, so they can 
not do better, and so we see the 
exact same thing,” he said.

The final area of racism Ross 

discussed were racial microag-
gressions, which he referred to 
as “A Four Year Plan to Drive 
Black 
Students 
Completely 

Crazy.” Ross said he believes 
racial microaggressions are 
the hardest to translate to 
those who do not personally 

experience them.

“Because people always say, 

‘Well you know you talk about 
racial microaggressions how bad 
can they be?’ ” he said.

Ross concluded his lecture by 

saying that anyone, regardless 
of skin color, can fight for racial 
justice. He encouraged audience 
members to learn to acknowledge 
racism in their homes and com-
munities.

“Get out of your comfort zone 

when it comes to your place in 
racism,” he said. “A lot of times 
when we come to college we think 
we are the enlightened ones.”

In an interview after the 

event, LSA freshman Alexandrea 
Somers said she was shocked by 
the findings of Ross’ research.

“I am a first-year student, so 

this was really enlightening to 
show that there are so many insti-

tutions that come into the college 
experience and those do shape 
and mold the presence of race on 
campus,” she said.

Another student, LSA fresh-

man Salwan Butrus, said he 
attended the event because of an 
interest in the topic.

“It has always been an inter-

est of mine, racism on campus, 
especially related to Greek life,” 
he said.

L

ast Thursday, I attended 
parts of the #UMBlackout: 
Mobilizing Black Communi-

ties for Radical 
Transformation 
in 
the 
Digital 

Age symposium, 
organized 
by 

the UM Social 
Work 
Commu-

nity 
Organiza-

tion 
Learning 

Committee and 
campus-wide 
partners. Among 
the 
dialogues 

of race, social 
networking and the #blacklives-
matter movement came one that 
I found particularly challenging: 
how to act as an ally.

I sat in on a workshop titled 

The Promises and Pitfalls of Ally-
ship in the Digital Age in which 
James Mohsin, who works for the 
National Center for Institutional 
Diversity, spoke on allyship, which 
is taking actions to speak up for 
people of a marginalized group 
that you do not belong to. He spoke 
on the importance of language, 
particularly the differentiation 
between using the word ally as a 
verb versus a noun.

This 
distinction 
is 
crucial 

when evaluating the extent to 
which we act as allies. As Mohsin 
put it, “There’s a big difference 
between being an ally and work-
ing as an ally or acting as an ally 
or currently standing in solidarity 
with.” He continued, “The truth 
is if we are not actively speaking 
always in that moment, we are 
not being an ally in that moment.” 
Through understanding this, we 
can also more easily recognize 
when self-proclaimed allies are 
not acting as allies. For example, 
a person who claims to be an ally 
and thus justifies making racist 
jokes because they “have a Black 
friend” or “understand the joke” 
are not, in that moment, acting as 
an ally. Instead, they are perpetu-

ating ideas that have negative con-
sequences on real people’s lives, 
which they justify because of their 
“allied status.”

Thus, the importance of acting as 

an ally is, when done right, meant to 
be a humbling process. It should not 
be about you. Now, of course there 
will be times when we can try our 
best to connect with other people 
by using our own experiences. I 
have found in my own experiences 
as a Muslim woman who wears 
hijab that I have a higher ability to 
sympathize with members of other 
marginalized communities, but I 
do not, nor will I ever, fully under-
stand what it is like to be a member 
of any group other than my own. 
Striking the balance between act-
ing as an ally and overstepping the 
line into ignorance of an experi-
ence of another group is something 
I constantly struggle with. 

When three Muslims — Deah, 

Yusor, and Razzan — were mur-
dered in a hate crime written off in 
many media sources as being on the 
basis of a parking dispute, I began to 
understand how communities have 
to carry the burden of deaths, espe-
cially when they are hate crimes. 
This tragedy also brought attention 
to Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, a 
15-year-old African American Mus-
lim boy who was killed in a hit-and-
run car crash, who received very 
little media or community atten-
tion. Though the deaths of these 
Muslims are not caused by police 
brutality, nor do I wish to create a 
comparison between the two, tak-
ing a step back and trying to under-
stand as best I can is something I 
strive to do. 

Thus, it is important to bear 

in mind that allyship is not about 
centering the voice of the ally, but 
instead about amplifying marginal-
ized voices. This is why notions like 
#AllLivesMatter are problematic, 
as they diffuse attention from the 
suffering of Black men and women 
and undermines their voices. As 
Mohsin said in his workshop, “You 

do have to do this and you don’t get 
a reward for it. You shouldn’t get 
a prize for being an ally.” He later 
continued, “It’s not the groups you 
belong to that make you an ally, it’s 
what you do in those moments.” No 
social activist title or job, or even 
political status, entitles people to 
say slanderous things even behind 
closed doors because if they do, 
they are not being an ally.

I also attended a panel discus-

sion later in the day, where I got 
the opportunity to ask a panel of 
Black social activists about act-
ing as an ally. The answer that 
resonated with me the most was 
from Morgan (Mo) Man Wil-
lis, a consultant who has led the 
Allied Media Conference since 
2012, who said, “You should also 
talk to your folks. Allyship is not 
about inserting yourselves into 
other 
communities 
and 
being 

like, ‘I’m here, put me to work!’ 
That’s great, we need that, too, 
but allyship is really about when 
nobody’s watching, you are still 
standing for the things that you 
declared allegiance to.” She later 
continued, “How are you talking 
to your folks who are embodying 
their own forms and functions 
of anti-Black racism or sexism 
or other problematic oppressive 
ideas.” This struck a chord with 
me because when I reflect on my 
own life, community and sphere 
of influence, I can see how easy it 
can sometimes be to forget that it 
is in our personal lives or smaller 
social media spheres where we 
can have the greatest impact. We 
know how our own communities 
and friends sometimes view racial 
and multiethnic groups in a nega-
tive light, and we are regularly 
granted opportunities to change 
that. It is the unglamourous work 
of speaking up in these situations 
that creates social change from 
the ground up.

J

on Bellion is set to release his debut 
album under Capitol Records. On his 
journey to a record deal, to comple-

ment the music he was 
giving 
away 
for 
free, 

Bellion wrote songs for 
larger 
recording 
art-

ists. Just for writing the 
chorus to Eminem’s hit 
single 
“The 
Monster,” 

Bellion made six figures 
in royalties. This market 
for ghostwriters enables 
musicians like Bellion to 
fund their projects and 
continue to release music 
for free. In fact, it’s possi-
ble for songwriters uninterested in fame to 
make a living only writing for other people. 
Despite the financial gains that ghostwrit-
ing presents, this practice impedes creativi-
ty in the music industry.

The 
idea 
of 
writ-

ing music for someone 
else is strange. Music 
is supposed to be per-
sonal. While collabora-
tion in the industry is 
common, there is a fine 
line between collabora-
tion and ghostwriting. 
Though I disagree with 
the practice of ghost-
writing, I can under-
stand 
the 
struggling 

songwriter who needs the money. I can also 
understand the talented songwriter who 
doesn’t seek fame. But what about the plati-
num-selling recording artist that takes credit 
for someone else’s work?

The reason artists who have already sold 

out arenas, won Grammys and built platforms 
for themselves still feel compelled to take 
advantage of other songwriters is a simple 
business decision. Hits pay the bills, which 
is why some top-tier artists sacrifice origi-
nality for guaranteed cash cows. After a hit 
song gets tirelessly run through Top 40 radio, 
racks up millions of streams and downloads, 
leads to sold-out shows and perhaps gets 
licensed for use on a Taco Bell commercial, it 
is amazing how much money it generates for 
both the singer and original writer.

The idea that hits pay the bills has come 

to dominate how the music industry oper-
ates — from the way record labels construct 
rosters of artists to how albums are promot-
ed to the market for ghostwriters. Record 
labels roll the dice by signing dozens of art-

ists in hopes that a few overachievers can 
cover the costs of the rest of the company. 
It sounds incredibly inefficient, but this 
reflects the large disparity in earnings that 
songs can generate.

Plenty of the biggest radio smash hits 

of recent years had ghostwriters. Drake’s 
“Hold On, We’re Going Home” was writ-
ten by Majid Jordan. Cee Lo Green’s “For-
get You” was written by a young Hawaiian 
kid named Bruno Mars. Even Michael 
Jackson’s “You Are Not Alone” was writ-
ten by future R&B star R. Kelly. Others 
are easy to find because writing credits 
are public and you can always find out 
if your favorite song was ghostwritten 
through a quick Wikipedia search. 

Ghostwriting also occurs in another way 

that’s equally bothersome. Record labels 
will prop up their young and untested talent 
by almost spoon-feeding them hit singles. 

R&B singer Alessia Cara 
is the perfect example. In 
August, Cara released her 
debut project under record 
label Def Jam. Def Jam 
took a risk on Cara, who 
was first discovered as a 
YouTube cover singer. To 
minimize the risk of an 
inexperienced songwriter, 
Def Jam put Cara in the 
studio with several more 
experienced 
songwrit-

ers and, just like that, her 

chart-topping single “Here” was born. Jus-
tin Bieber’s “Baby” similarly helped kick off 
his career, though Christina Milian was one 
of many artists credited with writing the 
hit. It’s a slightly different form of ghost-
writing, one initiated directly by the labels 
themselves, but the consequences have the 
same negative effects on creativity in the 
music industry.

These problems inevitably arise when 

music, or any art form for that matter, 
becomes a profitable enterprise. The solu-
tion involves a world where there is less 
demand for ghostwriters and more integrity 
for the music. The burden is on the super-
stars. Don’t rush an artist like Frank Ocean 
to put out his next album even though it’s 
been four years since his last. If it takes 
Ocean another four years, so be it. At least 
it’s his own.

The market for ghostwriters

A

s I boarded the Ethiopian 
Airlines plane last sum-
mer, prepared to embark 

on 
a 
10-week 

research 
proj-

ect 
examining 

family 
plan-

ning 
policy 

and messaging 
among a small 
subset of Ethio-
pian women, I 
noticed a sur-
prising amount 
of 
passengers 

wearing a cre-
ative array of 
T-shirts supporting orphanages, 
medical clinics and various other 
honorable causes. Due to our prox-
imity, I could not help but over-
hear their conversations.

They talked at length about 

their excitement at the prospect 
of bettering the lives of Ethiopi-
ans. They extolled the perceived 
benefits of their trip, providing 
humanitarian assistance to Ethio-
pians, but neglected to mention 
anything about what would hap-
pen after their departure.

Their conversation touched on an 

interesting internal dialogue about 
international 
development 
work 

that continues to fascinate me.

To start, there is nothing wrong 

with wanting to help people less 
fortunate than you, and I am by no 
means suggesting that any of the 
people on my plane had nefarious 
intentions. That being said, the 
notion that we can fly somewhere 
for a few days or weeks, partake in 
some feel-good project and actu-
ally make substantive change is 
rather perplexing.

This was not the first time I con-

fronted the issue of how to appro-
priately conduct work abroad. After 
emigrating from South Africa at 
age 8, I returned as a 12-year-old 
and had the opportunity to visit an 
HIV/AIDS orphanage in Soweto, a 
township outside of Johannesburg. 
While there, I met an 11-year-old 
taking care of her younger siblings 

following their parents’ deaths, who 
shattered my illusions about the 
Rainbow Nation. Collecting soccer 
cleats for the orphans as my Bar 
Mitzvah project certainly made me 
feel better.

A few years later, during my 

freshman year, I participated in 
an Alternative Spring Break trip to 
Nicaragua, where we bumbled our 
way through diabetes awareness 
meetings and clinic maintenance 
tasks. In the process, my Spanish 
improved (marginally) and I gained 
a new perspective on how inconse-
quential short-term work can be.

Neither of these experiences 

seemed to have a lasting, sustain-
able impact on the people I was sup-
posedly helping. Surely there is a 
better way?

William Easterly, co-director 

of the New York University Devel-
opment Research Institute, has 
written on the tendency of aid 
work to look for the “Next Big 
Idea” to save the world, when no 
such idea exists. His book “The 
White Man’s Burden” discredits 
the propensity of well-meaning 
people to pursue grand gestures of 
assistance that, in reality, struggle 
to change anything. He advocates 
tapping into the entrepreneurial 
spirit endemic to areas lacking 
institutional support in an effort 
to empower locals to incremental-
ly better their communities.

This 
approach, 
however, 
is 

not particularly helpful for an 
undergraduate student who lacks 
the resources to undertake such 
a project. How, then, can we as 
students make a lasting impact, 
despite the fact that we don’t have 
the option to actually embed our-
selves in a community and allocate 
the necessary time and resources 
to enable its people?

Listening to my fellow travel-

ers, the cliché “first, do no harm” 
came to mind. When we go abroad, 
we must be sure to mitigate any 
inadvertent negative effects on 
those we intend to help. This prin-
ciple appears to apply when we are 

undertaking short-term work and 
should shape community service 
work in any context.

However, if we have greater 

ambitions while traveling than 
having a new experience, we must 
accept the responsibility to do some 
research. A quick Google search 
yields at least 74 non-governmental 
organizations and 41 associations 
working in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s 
capital. There are likely more dis-
persed throughout the country.

This suggests that we should 

hone our focus on a project or an 
organization, particularly if it’s 
based abroad, that heavily involves 
local actors and focuses on building 
a bilateral partnership, such that 
its involvement means that foreign 
intervention is no longer needed 
down the road. This works to miti-
gate the fact that, as expressed in 
Easterly’s book, international work 
is grounded in a history of ulterior 
and often unsavory motives.

One route, which I took in Ethio-

pia, is to work with an institution 
that focuses on capacity building 
and partnership through reciprocal 
educational experiences, and train-
ing and retention of local expertise. 
Michigan, for example, has impres-
sive programs, one of which I’ve 
worked with, in Ghana and Ethiopia 
for students to do just that.

With all of this in mind, per-

haps the ultimate goal should be to 
avoid the paralysis that occasion-
ally accompanies nuanced think-
ing 
surrounding 
international 

development — which may work to 
dilute and potentially undermine 
progress — and instead focus on 
doing work that has been shown to 
succeed in the specific context of 
what we want to accomplish and 
where we want to accomplish it.

If you’re more confused about 

the impact of international work 
than when you started reading, 
though, don’t worry; as per usual, 
so am I.

SANDERS From Page 1

This distinction, though, results in an odd 
willingness among liberals to forsake the 
ideas they support, from health care as a 
human right to tuition-free higher educa-
tion, as fantasies. People who align idealis-
tically with Sanders will find themselves 
hailing pragmatism and drifting toward 
Hillaryland, saying, “In a perfect world, I’d 
vote for him, but I just don’t think he can 
pull it off,” or “Programs like that may work 
in Sweden, but I can’t see them being imple-
mented in the United States.”

David 
Brooks’ 
column 
“Livin’ 
Ber-

nie Sanders’s Danish Dream” bemoans 
the naiveté of millennials, supporting “a 
guy who fundamentally wants to reshape 
the American economic system, and thus 
reshape American culture and values.” He 
points out to Sanders’ supporters the litany 
of horrible problems that plague European 
countries operating under this brand of 
socialism, including long wait times at the 
doctor’s office and universities, as he puts it 
articulately, becoming “less good.”

Allow me to rebut. Sanders’ idealism is 

attempting to reshape the economic system 
not to alter American values, but rather to 
produce a system more compatible with our 
values of equality and economic liberty. Liv-
ing in poverty and debt due to hospital bills, 
a minimum wage below the poverty line or 
tuition spikes should not be commonplace 
in the wealthiest country on the planet. 
When Democrats read articles like Brooks’ 
and make concessions about the principles 
driving Sanders’ campaign, for the sake of 
“realism” or of winning the general election 
in November, they lose the touch with the 
very basis of American liberalism, the idea 
that the pursuit of equality and respect for 
the rights of the individual result in a better 
society for all.

Critics are not wrong when they point 

out, as they frequently do, that Sanders 
repeats himself a lot. He recycles riffs about 
income inequality, campaign finance and 
the criminal justice system. But why is this 
a problem? What better indication could 
there be for Democrats that he will not sub-

scribe to the custom in presidential elec-
tions of “running to the center of the road” 
in hopes of attracting moderates and inde-
pendents when November comes?

As his remarks came to an end, the 

74-year-old senator from Vermont remind-
ed his faithful that “thinking small” is part 
of the status quo. He then called on them 
to “think big,” but the crowd was unsatis-
fied. Hearing the impression of his thick 
New York accent rippling through the 
crowd, Sanders obliged and corrected him-
self —think “yuuuuuuge.” And why not? 
The best campaigns are composed of ideas, 
like Obama’s in 2008 preaching “Hope” and 
“Yes We Can.”

Of course, pragmatism is important in 

the public discourse. But in campaign sea-
son, with four years of governing ahead of 
the 45th president to iron out the kinks and 
navigate the legislative challenges, pragma-
tism cannot define your vote. That is mis-
placed caution, casting a ballot based on 
what others tell you, rather than what you 
believe, is possible. If you do not believe that 
health care is a human right, that higher 
education should be debt-free or that the 
minimum wage should be $15 per hour, do 
not vote for Bernie Sanders. However, if you 
support those ideas but will vote for Hillary 
Clinton because she’s more realistic, take a 
minute to consider whether that vote would 
truly represent you.

Idealism is not a vice. Idealism drives the 

Sanders campaign. Idealism made thou-
sands upon thousands of feet stomp and 
shake the arena Monday afternoon. Ideal-
ism attracts voters from every generation to 
the same, singular man. Idealism won the 
New Hampshire primary and nearly tied 
the Iowa caucus.

Bernie Sanders is a 21st century Don 

Quixote, tilting at windmills to undo 
wrongs and bring justice to the world. So, 
instead of running scared or clinging to a 
fabricated definition of pragmatism, liber-
als should recognize Sanders for what he is: 
their very own knight.

‘Scandal’ is back and 
needs to change it up

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Senior Arts Editor

“Scandal” seems to follow a 

similar pattern every half-season 
or so. After each season of crazy, 
convoluted 
plot, the show 
presses 
the 

reset 
button, 

leaving all the 
characters in a 
state of relative 
peace. 
Olivia 

Pope 
(Kerry 

Washing-
ton, 
“Django 

Unchained”) 
begins 
each 

season 
by 

spending a few 
episodes tackling cases of the 
week with Pope & Associates. 
These episodes recall a calm USA 
political procedural, there to ease 
you gently into the undoubtedly 
batshit serialized story to follow.

The fifth midseason premiere, 

“It’s Hard Out Here for a Gener-
al,” takes this route again. Olivia, 
Huck (Guillermo Díaz, “Stone-
wall”), Quinn (Katie Lowes, “Big 
Hero 6”) and newer associate 
Marcus (Cornelius Smith Jr., “All 
My Children”) tackle the case of 
National Security Agency head 
General Diane Peters (McNally 
Sagal, 
“Pleasantville”), 
whose 

boyfriend is suspected of leaking 
classified NSA information from 
her personal computer. While 
Olivia works to defend her cli-
ent and find the whistleblower 
who caused the leak, Jake Ballard 

(Scott Foley, “Grey’s Anatomy”) 
works under President Fitzger-
ald Grant (Tony Goldwyn, “The 
Last Samurai”) to prevent crucial 
information from reaching The 
Washington Post. Olivia and Jake, 
still sleeping together despite 
their long-dead emotional rela-
tionship, find themselves at cross-
purposes, with Jake working to 
have Peters removed for keeping 
classified files on her PC.

The NSA leak plot works well 

because the major players have 
personal stakes; Olivia is faced 
with opposition from one ex-
boyfriend, so she tries to contact 
another ex to help her out, but Fitz 
doesn’t answer her call. The end-
ing twist of the episode, though, 
reveals that there are significant 
repercussions even beyond these 
initial stakes. It turns out Jake 
was the one who orchestrated the 
whole thing, framing Peters’s boy-
friend and forcing her resignation 
to take her place as the head of the 
NSA. Still in the role of Eli Pope’s 
(Joe Morton, “Eureka”) obedient 
surrogate son, Jake seems to be 
the new villain of “Scandal.” This 
is probably the right move; the 
series has failed to find a real pur-
pose for Jake since his introduc-
tion in season two, and making 
him this season’s villain justifies 
him staying around a bit longer.

As entertaining as this all is, 

“Scandal” has reached a point 
in its five-season run where so 
many betrayals and dalliances 
have occurred that nothing feels 
quite as fresh or urgent as it did 
back in the season two Defiance 

arc. When Olivia first embraces 
Jake near the beginning of the 
episode, it doesn’t come as a sur-
prise, especially because it’s lay-
ered over with “Scandal” ’s typical 
Motown soundtrack that comes 
out for scenes of violence or sex. 
And the continued existence of 
Eli Pope on this show is mind-
boggling by now, his interminable 
monologues still peppering every 
scene he’s in. How can Olivia hap-
pily dine with her father and sleep 
with Jake after all that has trans-
pired between them? Since “Scan-
dal” has no plans to drop Olivia 
in an entirely new setting with a 
new cast of characters, this isn’t a 
problem that can be easily solved 
until the characters acknowledge 
the abusive nature of their rela-
tionships.

At least Olivia and Fitz’s break-

up is sticking for now; theirs is 
the one relationship that actu-
ally has been called out for its 
toxicity. There are hints of other 
moves towards change, too. Abby 
Whelan (Darby Stanchfield, “Mad 
Men”) has a fun subplot where 
she deals with being Fitz’s “work 
wife,” and Mellie Grant (Bel-
lamy Young, “Criminal Minds”) 
is still on the path to the White 
House, writing a memoir under 
Olivia’s guidance. Between Jake’s 
switch to the dark side, the lack 
of Olivia-Fitz interaction and 
Cyrus Beene’s (Jeff Perry, “Grey’s 
Anatomy”) powerlessness in the 
position he once loved, this half-
season has the potential to really 
shake up the status quo. That’s 
what “Scandal” needs right now.

KANYE WEEK
When Kanye West 
was too cool for me

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

I distinctly remember when 

I heard my first Kanye song. I 
was 10 years old, and my neigh-
bor across the street (who was 
clearly much older and wiser 
at the ripe age of 12) was show-
ing off her recently acquired 
iPod (which was shiny blue and 
very exciting). I managed to 
convince my mother to allow 
me out of the house after din-
ner and ventured to the end 
of our driveway. My neighbor 
biked around and skidded to 
a stop in front of me. She held 
out one earbud and “Gold Dig-
ger” flooded through my head. 
It was glorious.

Aside 
from 
being 
much 

cooler than my small, 10-year-
old brain could comprehend 
(seriously, any song that said 
“fuck” was out of my league), 
“Gold Digger” led me to gain 
a new understanding of the 
world. While my mother prob-
ably didn’t know I was listening 
to Kanye, I started devouring 
anything I could get my hands 
on. With no iPod of my own to 
speak of, I resorted to listen-
ing to other people’s devices 
through one earbud. (As a side 
note: my first iPod would be 

brought by Santa next Christ-
mas and shamelessly, “Bubbly” 
by Colbie Caillat was the first 
purchase.)

I was 12 when I heard 

“Heartless” on the radio. This 
revelation led to a new era in 
my life of taking songs much 
too seriously and memorizing 
rap verses to whip out as a hid-
den talent. I sang like a woman 
scorned and impressed people 
with my ability to perform both 
the background sound effects 
and echoes at junior high danc-
es. I was a true one-woman 
show.

In 2009, Kanye infamously 

interrupted Taylor Swift at the 
VMAs, effectively splitting the 
population in half — you were 
either with Kanye or against 
him. While I may have strayed 
away from Kanye for a time, 
I can thank him for deepen-

ing my love for Taylor. In the 
year following that interac-
tion I was head of the Taylor 
Swift Defense Squad and per-
fected the art of crying on cue 
to “White Horse.” Now that 
I’ve distanced myself from this 
emotional turmoil, I see that 
Kanye showed me confidence 
in its ultimate and perfected 
form. Never before had I seen 
someone stand up so blatantly 
for what they believed to be 
true. It was inspirational and 
intimidating, all at the same 
time.

After I began paying more 

attention to Kanye in the pub-
lic sphere, I became aware of 
the statements he was making. 
I started listening to his albums 
in order and in full and realized 
that at his core Kanye is simply 
an artist.

From aggressively preaching 

self-confidence, self-love and 
true ambition, Kanye has fully 
and wholly created a brand that 
extends far beyond the music 
industry. 
And 
after 
recent 

Twitter fights with Wiz Khal-
ifa and lyrics dissing Taylor 
Swift? I think he knows exactly 
what he’s doing.

(And Kanye, if you’re reading 

this, I’m in the market for a new 
pair of Yeezys.)

FILM REVIEW
‘How To Be Single’ 
is real and hopeful

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

“How To Be Single” doesn’t 

want to be the typical rom-com. 
Rather than an overbearing pres-
ence of mushy 
feelings 
or 

raunchy 
sex 

scenes, we get 
portrayals 
of 

typical relation-
ship 
struggles 

faced by ordi-
nary people. 

It’s amazing 

that the film 
manages 
to 

adequately develop both the nar-
rative and the characters since it 
follows a whopping ten different 
individuals, centered on twenty-
something paralegal Alice (Dakota 
Johnson, “Fifty Shades of Grey”). 
After she and her “soulmate,” 
Josh (Nicholas Braun, “Freaks of 
Nature”), decide it’s over, Alice 
meets Robin (Rebel Wilson, “Pitch 
Perfect 2”). She’s the typical Rebel 
Wilson character, a hilariously 
loud-mouthed party animal with 
a strong sense of self-awareness. 
Accompanying Alice’s narrative 
are the stories of her workaholic 
sister, Meg (Leslie Mann, “Vaca-
tion”) and bartender, Tom (Anders 
Holm, “Workaholics”).

Holm commendably provides 

a natural depth to the average 
20-year-old man. He doesn’t 
overact, but simply exists as 
his character. At first, with his 
somewhat cynical tone and slight 

cockiness, Tom exudes fucc-
boi, but slowly, the layers strip 
away. When he shares intimate 
moments with Alice, he reveals 
a gentler, more honest side. Tom 
isn’t afraid to admit that all guys 
reiterate the same manipulative 
lines just to get girls into bed, yet 
he’s well aware of what it’s like to 
truly love someone.

Meg serves as a representative 

for the subset of women who avoid 
love to focus on their careers. 
However, the root of her hesi-
tancy toward love is her desire to 
maintain completely control of 
everything. Mann convincingly 
portrays an overwhelmed but 
highly capable woman until she 
gets pregnant. Her “pregnant 
woman” outbursts are too spo-
radic and too violent, making her 
seem more on the verge of mental 
insanity than someone dealing 
with fluctuating hormones; one 
second she’s throwing a chair 
and the next she’s calmly whis-
pering. With regards to her lover 
Ken (Jake Lacy, “Carol”), who is 
the receptionist from Alice’s law 
firm, Lacy either exhibits too 
much emotion or none at all. He 
also makes Ken seem too clueless 
about blatantly obvious things, 
but boys are stupid, so that’s more 
forgivable than his drastic emo-
tional shifts.

Overall, “How to be Single” is 

profoundly feminist. Even its feel-
good soundtrack is dominated by 
female artists. Anthems consist of 
Taylor Swift’s “Welcome to New 
York” introducing the setting and 

Hailee Steinfeld’s “Love Myself” 
playing with the end credits. These 
anthems keep the empowerment 
flowing even after the film’s end. 
It’s one of my favorite end credit 
sequences ever — it uses symbols 
rather than pictures to represent 
the characters, demonstrating that 
people are defined by more than 
physical qualities.

The best part of the film is unde-

niably Rebel Wilson; it couldn’t 
have drawn the laughs without 
her. Continuing Fat Amy’s humor 
in “Pitch Perfect,” Wilson’s char-
acter constantly spews puns, but 
this time they’re about dicks, not 
a cappella. Robin encourages Alice 
to play (in her own words) sexual 
monopoly, where you pass go and 
collect 200 dicks. She makes the 
point that Alice gets “trapped in 
dicksand,” the act of conforming to 
a man’s desires. Playing off a typi-
cal rom-com trope, the funniest 
instance not attributed to Wilson 
is when Alice walks out of a hotel, 
just after having her epiphany and 
proudly declares to the cab driver 
that she is going home. Completely 
ruining the moment, the cab driv-
er snipes back with, “I don’t know 
where the fuck you live!”

Thoroughly entertaining and 

impressively empowering, “How 
to be Single” captures what it’s like 
trying to live and love in the real 
world. Through its strong sense of 
identity, the film reminds us that 
best parts of life are the moments 
when we can completely stand on 
our own two feet, defined by no 
one other than ourselves.

Khalifa’s latest 
album is terrible

After all these 

years, Wiz is tired 

of his own crap

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

I never thought Wiz would 

still be around for this long, 
but full credit to him for drag-
ging 
out 
his 

career 
into 

2016. It’s hard 
to believe Kush 
& OJ came out 
six years ago, 
and in revisit-
ing that semi-
nal 
project, 

it’s more than 
apparent that this dude has 
completely run out of ideas 
on his newest album, Khalifa. 
2010 saw Wiz break through 
as one of the standout MCs of 
the 2010 XXL Freshman class 
– one of the strongest ever with 
Freddie Gibbs, Big Sean and 
Fashawn. I remember this with 
great detail because it marked 
the birth of the DatPiff era and 
the resurgence of mixtape-rap. 
Wiz was cool to all my 14-year-
old friends and me because he 
could rap about weed all day 
and never run out things to say; 
Mary Jane has and always will 
be his muse.

Yet, like his fans (who are 

definitely too old for this shit 
now), Wiz’s career hasn’t aged 
so well. There’s nothing wrong 
with his one-dimensionality; 

Pusha T has rapped about 
cocaine for 20 years and it still 
hasn’t gotten old. The problem 
is when the artist himself loses 
sight of his raison d’etre. On 
Khalifa, Wiz sounds tired of his 
own shit, like he sighs before he 
hits each joint.

The Khalifa experience is 

almost an exercise in cring-
ing. One of the earlier cuts is a 
track titled “Celebrate,” where 
he rhymes “Rolex” with “mo’ 
sex.” Naturally, you have to 
wonder what reason Wiz even 
has to celebrate; what was the 
last major development in his 
career as a rapper? In the six 
years since Kush & OJ, all he’s 
given us are watered down ver-
sions of “Mezmorized.” What 
happened to all of that youth-
ful energy? What happened to 
the poetry he used to conjure 
about Polo socks and expen-
sive sunglasses? This album 
is so unimaginative that he 
unironically starts a verse off 
with “One for the money” … all 
that’s missing is a Skizzy Mars 
feature.

On “City View,” he spits “All 

this paper got me shitting in 
public.” After cleaning off the 
water I spat onto my comput-
er screen, I ran the song back 
because I was almost certain I’d 
misheard him. Lo and behold, 
it’s right there in the first forty-
five seconds. Nah, we’re not let-
ting that slide this year.

The album has a few negli-

gible features from the Taylor 
Gang crew, but the one surpris-
ing inclusion is Travis Scott. 
Including the rap-game chame-

leon on Wiz’s album is a dead 
giveaway that he’s lost all sense 
of direction. Travis has a prov-
en track record of shape-shift-
ing into the flavor of the month, 
and sadly it’s gained a lot of 
commercial 
traction. 
People 

actually get excited about Tra-
vis Scott features these days, 
and “Bake Sale” is one that your 
friend rocking DC shoes will 
likely text you about.

“Call Waiting” is another 

album cut that highlights the 
descent of Wiz, namely because 
it’s just a weaker but more 
commercially appealing version 
of “Huey Newton.” The end of 
“Lit” is actually so generic 
that it sounds like a parody of 
itself: “I’mma get money n***a / 
I’mma get money / I’mma keep 
it real / and I love getting high.” 
Dude sounds like he just picked 
up “Rap Music for Dummies” 
and is still going through 
tutorials.

Just like “the guy on the 

couch” from “Half Baked,” 
Khalifa is essentially a remind-
er that Wiz has overstayed his 
welcome. At this point he’s just 
polluting the hip-hop scene 
with recycled weed parapher-
nalia, and no one really knows 
what he’s going for. Many will 
argue that he’s more “lyrical” 
than recently celebrated artists 
like Young Thug and Playboi 
Carti, but I would argue that 
Wiz is simply more decipher-
able and less expressive. Khalifa 
is what happens when you run 
out of ideas, but how about just 
making something that genu-
inely moves people?

Yeezy extends Ye’s 
brand for Season 3

By ANAY KATYAL

For the Daily

Jarring. That’s really the only 

apt descriptor for the evening I 
experienced on Feb. 11, 2016.

The city of Ypsilanti, Michigan 

is a far cry from New York City. 
It’s a Midwestern sprawl, the 
antithesis of everything New 
York represents as a city. And yet, 
here I was, posted up in the town’s 
local IMAX theater, anxiously 
waiting for a stream of Kanye 
West unveiling The Life of Pablo 
and Yeezy Season 3 at Madison 
Square Garden.

I was clearly far removed from 

the Fashion Week travails of New 
York, but I was still surrounded by 
levels of hype that might make one 
think otherwise. The absurdity 
of the situation sort of left me 
feeling like some side character 
in a hypebeast-laden episode of 
“Seinfeld” (in an alternate reality 
where “Seinfeld” is still on TV, 
Jerry sports Yeezy Boosts instead 
of Nike Airs and Kramer always 
laments his inability to purchase 
“fire jawnz”).

Swaths of people overtook an 

awkward corner in the theater, 

a space a lot of them likely 
wouldn’t occupy if it weren’t 
for an event cobbled together 
by their self-appointed cultural 
idol. People were slapping hands, 
commiserating over their mutual 
fascination of what was about 
to unfold. Shoes were being 
compared, outfits were being 
complimented. The occasional 
streetwear meme was screamed 
out by a suburban teenager 
wearing 
fake 
Yeezys 
and 
a 

Champion hoodie. It was clear 
that Ypsi’s Rave Cinemas wasn’t 
used to being a hotbed for such 
commotion, or such clientele.

Everyone patiently waiting in 

line for the showing aesthetically 
blended 
together. 
Audience 

wardrobes were fairly limited 
in their color palette (myself 
embarrassingly included). Save 
for the occasional candy-apple 
red Air Max or absurdly loud 
Supreme jacket, desert brown, 
olive green and black seemed 
like the only colors that people 
felt were appropriate to wear — 
a fitting homage to the subject 
of the show, I suppose. It was 
clear that attendees sought to 
gussy themselves up in their 
best streetwear outfits, akin to a 
suburban family wearing their 
nicest clothing to Easter mass. 
Collectively, it felt like I was in 
the middle of an amalgamation of 
street style caricatures more than 
anything else.

When the stream began, it was 

obvious that my theater wasn’t an 
isolated case. A camera panned 
over a packed Madison Square 
Garden, 
displaying 
a 
similar 

demographic of people, all of 
them with bizarre, concurrent 
expressions of excitement and 
shock on their faces. It was 
clear that the public bought into 
Kanye’s hype over this event, 
both in New York and around 
the world. My MSG counterparts 
spent hundreds of dollars on 
seats, commemorative jackets and 
sweatshirts, and the opportunity 
to be distantly graced with the 
presence of the esteemed Kanye 
West. West claimed there were 
20,000 individuals present. I 
believe it. In addition to that 
impressive number, people like 
myself were also streaming the 
event at multiplexes across the 
globe. People paid to watch West’s 
extravaganza 
of 
his 
fashion, 

music and miscellaneous creative 
visions. I paid to watch this. 
Fascinating.

The clothes conveyed well-

crafted symbolism thanks to 
Vanessa Beecroft, an artist and 
creative that frequently works 
with Kanye West. Models were 
carefully placed on towering 
platforms in the pit of the venue. 
The scene was reminiscent of 
the sobering images of Rwandan 
refugees 
Kanye 
had 
chosen 

to display on invites to the 
event. Whether or not it was 
intentional, considering today’s 
global political climate, MSG felt 
culturally topical that night.

West’s latest collection was 

a definitive continuation of the 
aesthetic he has so carefully 
crafted in past seasons. Models 
were largely wearing stretchy 
leggings, over-sized sweatshirts 
and shearling coats, in addition 
to 
the 
notorious 
Adidas-

manufactured 
sneakers 
and 

boots. Save for some of the more 

creative outerwear and refreshed 
footwear, much of the collection 
was fairly basic. It did its 
fundamental job as “clothing.” It 
was wearable. The large reliance 
on technical fabrics falls in line 
with today’s continuing trend of 
“athleisure” clothing. The color 
palette of cocoa brown, wine red 
and burnt turmeric was a nice 
change of pace. Everything was 
fine. Kanye didn’t really fuck 
up, so he can find solace in that. 
Outside of that, though, there 
really isn’t much else to be said.

Sure, West has a passion for 

fashion. Whether this passion 
is as evident in his clothes as he 
thinks is something I’m unsure 
of, though. If anything, West’s 
passion is rooted in his ability 
to use fashion as a vehicle for 
communicating 
his 
thoughts 

and visions. His clothes give 
outsiders a look into his mind, 
into his emotions and his creative 
process. And while that’s all 
fine and dandy (and definitely 
something he does far better than 
some of fashion’s old guard), for 
all the noise Kanye and his Yeezy 
collections make, unlike West’s 
own psyche, the clothes leave 
little to be remembered.

Don’t get me wrong; the 

outerwear is solid, and the hype 
the footwear garners is fairly 
merited. There’s a turtleneck that 
I’ll probably (and unabashedly) 
try my hardest to purchase, even 
if it means setting an alarm and 
waking up hours earlier than 
usual to make it happen. But 
considering that parroting “Kanye 
is only just getting into the game! 
Kanye needs his time to develop!” 
was how fans tried to calm critics 
of his first two collections, one 
would rationally expect a more 
substantial progression in the 
Yeezy aesthetic. Here, we are left 
with a lot of the same of what we’ve 
already seen, bar a color palette 
update. Sometimes, I think Kanye 
is only dedicated to his clothes as 
a means of furthering his brand 
image and identity. Sometimes, I 
don’t know.

Whatever the industry and 

supposed “critics” like myself 
want 
to 
think, 
long 
lines 

meandered around the event’s 
merchandise stands at Madison 
Square Garden. Four friends and 
I paid $35 to see the event, as 
did thousands of others. People 
paid attention to what West had 
to say. Objectively speaking, 
we wasted a Thursday evening 
listening to soon-to-be-released 
music, 
watching 
emotionless 

models 
unveil 
expensive 

clothing, hearing a mad creative 
speak his mind.

Speaking personally, we had a 

memorable cultural experience 
on the graces of one of our 
favorite artists. If West pulls 
a similar stunt for Season 4, I 
can see myself indulging again. 
Why? I can’t succinctly say. 
West has a mystique next to 
none, not only on the hip hop 
scene, but the creative scene as a 
whole. The man, and his various 
rambling, muddied rants, has a 
charm, well beyond the music 
he 
makes. 
Though 
West’s 

clothes don’t really have the 
merit he strives for, his various 
creative pursuits still leave me 
artistically satiated and well-
entertained. In the end, I guess 
that’s all I really want.

STYLE REVIEW

New ‘Zoolander’ 
is a total disaster

Ben Stiller’s sequel 
almost ruins the 
beloved original

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

“Zoolander 2” is an absolute 

mess of a movie. Coming is years 
after the original, it almost feels 
more like a 
remake 
than 

a sequel. The 
plot 
famil-

iarly 
follows 

vain, 
stupid 

and 
really, 

really ridicu-
lously 
good-

looking male 
models Derek 
Zoolander (Ben Stiller, “Night 
at the Museum”) and Hansel 
(Owen Wilson, “Midnight in 
Paris”). They’re back to, yet 
again, battle the evil Mugatu 
(Will Ferrell, “Daddy’s Home”) 
to save the fashion world. But 
this time, it’s personal. Mugatu 
plans on killing Zoolander’s 
son because since he’s directly 
descended from the first ever 
male model, his blood is essen-
tially the fountain of youth. If 
the plot feels familiar, that’s 
because it’s more or less the plot 
of the original.

The only surprise in “Zool-

ander 2” is the number of celeb-
rity cameos. Most of the cast is 
credited as playing themselves, 

and most seem to be nothing 
but distractions from the bor-
ing and repetitive plot. Sur-
prisingly, the most successful 
cameos are delivered by Jus-
tin Bieber and Neil deGrasse 
Tyson. The film opens with a 
strong and funny bit in which 
Bieber is brutally murdered but 
stays alive long enough to post a 
final selfie. Some are tragically 
underdeveloped, 
like 
Kiefer 

Sutherland (“24”) as a member 
of Hansel’s communal polyam-
orous relationship. And most, 
like a promising yet disappoint-
ing 
Benedict 
Cumberbatch 

(“The Imitation Game”) as a 
trendy, 
androgynous 
model, 

are just filler for a very empty 
movie. The only way “Zoolan-
der 2” surprises its audience 
is by making them say, “I can’t 
believe that guy would be in this 
movie.”

This sort of over-the-top sat-

ire of male modeling was daring 
in 2001 when the idea of male 
vanity was still taboo. However, 
in a world of Biebers, Kanyes 
and men who get famous tak-
ing selfies on Instagram, that 
humor feels a little outdated. 
The fashion world is still ripe 
for a satirical takedown, but 
doing so through the lens of 
male modeling is no longer 
effective. “Zoolander 2” dips its 
toe in humor pointed at other 
aspects of the industry — the 
world’s biggest designers help 
orchestrate a ritual sacrifice 
promising to unleash the foun-

tain of youth. But because Marc 
Jacobs and Anna Wintour play 
themselves (and are therefore 
clearly in on the joke), they 
serve to only further the sat-
ire of Derek and Hansel rather 
than provide a vehicle by which 
to poke fun at other aspects of 
the fashion world. Unfortunate-
ly, the movie decides to remain 
too derivative of the original 
and gets itself stuck making 
the same jokes about the same 
people.

For a movie barely longer 

than ninety minutes, there is a 
lot going on. So much so, that 
it feels like a movie of sub-
plots, with no driving storyline. 
There’s an underdeveloped bit 
about 
Derek’s 
reconciliation 

with his son (newcomer Cyrus 
Arnold). The plot that seems to 
set the film in motion — some-
one is killing all the good-look-
ing people in the world — is all 
but abandoned by the halfway 
mark. “Zoolander 2” needs at 
least another hour to complete 
everything it sets out to do, but 
knows its audience could not 
stand a minute more.

“Zoolander 2” is so bad it 

almost retroactively ruins the 
original. It’s a soulless, charm-
less tangle of a movie relying 
too heavily on the cult success of 
its predecessor. The humor falls 
flat, the characters are dislik-
able at best and the plot simply 
doesn’t exist. The most satisfy-
ing moment of “Zoolander 2” is 
when the credits start to roll.

Huntley owns second Senior Night

By MAGGIE KOLCON 

For the Daily

The Michigan wrestling team 

is going to have a huge hole to 
fill at the 197-pound weight class 
come next season. Sixth-year 
senior Max Huntley wrestled 
his last regular-season match 
Friday night at Cliff Keen Arena, 
winning against Purdue’s Drake 
Stein with an impressive 16-1 
technical fall.

Huntley is in his third season 

as a captain for the Wolverines, 
a first in Michigan wrestling 
history. He is undefeated in dual 
meets this season, along with 
his upperweight teammates and 
fellow captains, juniors Adam 
Coon and Domenic Abounader.

Huntley’s 
bout 
was 

highlighted by an early 10-1 lead 
before the end of the first period, 
which allowed him to add two 
more single-leg takedowns to 
end the match with 40 seconds 
remaining in the third period.

“I 
was 
pretty 
confident,” 

Huntley said. “The only thing 
I was worried about was that 
Adam (Coon) was going to get a 
pin, because I’m leading the pin 
count for the team. You get an 
award at the end of the year, and 
if Adam would have gotten a pin, 
it would’ve been tied, so I’m not 
too upset about that.”

Despite Michigan coach Joe 

McFarland’s jokes about bringing 
him back for a seventh season, 
Huntley will finish his collegiate 
career this March. The sixth-
year wrestler participated in the 
Senior Night ceremony last year 
before the NCAA granted him 
eligibility for another season, 
but he was not keen on walking 
through it again.

“When I wasn’t there yesterday, 

they took a team vote to see if I 
should get off the hook,” Huntley 
said. “I guess I lost the vote by a 
huge mass decision. But I made an 
agreement with (McFarland) that 

he would have to walk out with 
me at least, but he hoodwinked me 
and didn’t go out there. He had a 
pretty good laugh.”

McFarland has had ample 

opportunity to get to know his 
oldest team member. Throughout 
his time at Michigan, Huntley 
has accumulated five varsity 
letters and 78 wins for the 
Wolverines.

“He’s going to be a hard 

one to replace, I’ll be honest,” 
McFarland said. “Anytime you 
get a guy like that that’s got all 
that experience and has wrestled 
really well for you, you hate 
losing those guys.”

But Huntley still has an 

important postseason to guide 
his team through. It won’t be his 
focus or his drive that makes the 
biggest impact in his opinion, but 

rather his sense of humor.

“A lot of teams I’ve been on 

have been very serious,” Huntley 
said. “We’re in the locker room 
and everyone is sitting there 
with 
brows 
furrowed. 
(It’s) 

tough going through a whole Big 
Ten season like that. You can 
ask a lot of guys, I kind of joke 
around a lot, try to keep it a little 
lighter. That’s a small thing, but 
over the course of how long a 
college season is, I think it does 
kind of help.”

The Wolverines have followed 

Huntley’s example of keeping 
things light, most notably during 
senior Cody Vanderhagen’s plea 
for a job offer in his Senior Night 
introduction. From the looks 
of Michigan’s 13-2 season, it’s 
ability to have fun with the sport 
has worked. Even the pregame 

meals are a bit of a joke. 

“That’s funny because me and 

(Abounader) eat the exact same 
meal,” Huntley said. “Every time, 
both of us eat the exact same 
thing. It’s such a crappy meal, 
because it’s bagels and cream 
cheese dunked in soup, and it 
doesn’t sound good. But it’s like 
a Stockholm Syndrome where 
you start to love it. ... It’s kind 
of becoming one of my favorite 
meals.”

Huntley will be wrestling in 

the Big Ten championships in 
two weeks, when he will have an 
opportunity to better last year’s 
fifth-place 
finish. 
Regardless 

of the outcome, one thing is for 
certain: The impact Huntley has 
made on Michigan wrestling 
over the past six years will be 
long-lasting.

‘M’ top B1G team 
in preseason polls

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

Preseason accolades mean little 

to the Michigan baseball team. 
Instead, the rankings are an award 
for last year’s work, rather than 
any true prediction for the coming 
season. 

“It doesn’t matter if you’re 

ranked top 25, or if you’re a lower-
ranked team,” said senior left-
hander Evan Hill. “You still have 
to compete in every single inning 
and in every single pitch.”

The Wolverines are currently 

ranked by two different sources, 
Baseball America and the NCAA, 
at the No. 15 and 25 slot nationally, 
respectively. Michigan is the only 
Big Ten team to appear in the top 
25, and the the only cold-weather 
school as well. 

“We just try to improve by 

one percent every day,” Hill 
said. “We talk about that all 
the time. Pitching and defense 
win championships, and that’s 
something we put a precedent on 
in our program. And maybe people 
see we have both those strong suits 
going into this season.”

Despite 
the 
Wolverines’ 

indifference, the commendations 
are quite impressive. 

Notably, just this week, the team 

was also picked by a committee of 
conference coaches as the favorite 
to win the 2016 Big Ten Baseball 
Championship.

Hill, his teammates and the 

coaching staff all mirror his 
sentiments that these rankings 
will have no effect on their play. 

“It’s nice to be recognized for 

hard work,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “But those rankings 
fall in the uncontrollable zone. 
It really has no impact on the 
outcome of the game, and it has no 

impact on our training. These guys 
are going to strive to improve daily 
regardless of ranking.”

Currently in his fourth season, 

Bakich led the team to win the Big 
Ten Tournament last year. The 
2015 Michigan team (14-10 Big 
Ten, 39-25 overall) went to the 
NCAA Tournament for the first 
time since 2008, but its season 
ended with a disappointing loss 
to Louisville during the NCAA 
Regionals.

Much of that team, however, 

is returning to the current roster, 
which boasts some individual 
awards as well. 

Notable 
returning 
players 

include sophomore infielder Jake 
Bivens, who was named the Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year last 
year. Additionally, junior left-
handers Carmen Benedetti and 
Brett Adcock were both named 
to the College Sports Madness 
preseason All-Big Ten first team. 

Though the players, and the 

team itself, humbly disregard the 
attention, there is one stat that 
does matter to the coaching staff.

“We 
lead 
the 
nation 
in 

freshman All-Americans the last 
three years,” Bakich said, “which 
isn’t a stat I’m boasting about, just 
making a point that we’ve had 
success with the freshmen making 
an impact.”

Of the freshman class, four 

players were named to the Big 
Ten All-Freshman team last year, 
including Bivens. Additionally, the 
team boasted three Wolverines 
in the MLB First-Year Player 
Draft and eight Louisville Slugger 
Freshman All-Americans — the 
most in the nation under Bakich’s 
first three years. 

“We try not to worry about the 

past that much,” Bakich said. “It’s 
just a point of reference.”

Michigan leans on 
No. 1 doubles pair

Success by Ruder-

Hook, Minor 

spurs victories for 

Wolverines

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

Sophomore 
Mira 
Ruder-

Hook and freshman Brienne 
Minor were in a tight match.

The No. 1 doubles team had 

traded games back and forth 
with 
Notre 
Dame’s 
Quinn 

Gleason and Monica Robinson, 
and now needed to hold serve, 
up 5-4, to clinch a victory.

With the game score 40-0 

in favor of Michigan, Minor 
unleashed 
a 
serve 
at 
her 

opponent’s 
backhand. 
The 

return landed out, and the 
duo won their match to secure 
the 
doubles 
point 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

The pair is now 4-0 in dual-

matches this year, was ranked 
for the first time this week at 
No. 26 and has proven to be 
crucial to the team’s success in 
doubles.

When No. 8 Michigan wins 

the doubles point, it bodes well 
for its overall success in the 
match. Following their win 
against Notre Dame on Sunday, 
the Wolverines are now 5-0 in 
dual-match play after winning 
the doubles point.

Minor 
and 
Ruder-Hook 

have been the most consistent 
doubles pair for the Wolverines, 
staying together while coach 
Ronni Bernstein has switched 
up the No. 2 and 3 doubles 
teams recently.

“It’s just clicked from the 

beginning,” 
Bernstein 
said. 

“They enjoy playing with each 
other.”

For 
Minor, 
playing 
with 

Ruder-Hook has been a good 
experience mentally.

“We know how to calm each 

other down if we’re nervous or 

not playing our best,” Minor 
said. 
“We 
started 
playing 

regionals at the beginning of 
the year and (coach) thought 
we complemented each other 
really well. We set each other 
up really well. We stuck with it 
and had some good results.”

On Sunday, it was clear 

the two had a lethal on-court 
connection.

Minor 
and 
Ruder-Hook 

were both active at the net, 
constantly moving to get in 
position for volleys.

“It’s hard to get balls by them 

at the net,” Bernstein said.

The 
pair 
also 
kept 
the 

Fighting Irish uncomfortable 
by returning their serving with 
several different positions.

And when Michigan was 

serving, there were several 
moments during which the 
Wolverines moved and attacked 
as if they were one.

“They’re both aggressive,” 

Bernstein 
said. 
“They 

complement each other. (Minor 
is) good at the net, moves well 
and has great groundstrokes, 
and 
(Ruder-Hook) 
comes 

forward. They’re intimidating 
when they’re playing well.”

Minor and Ruder-Hook not 

only get along well on the court, 
but off it as well.

“I love playing with (Minor),” 

Ruder-Hook said. “We really 
like each other as people so I 
think that helps.”

Added Minor: “We hang out 

all the time. We both like to eat 
a lot.”

As 
Michigan 
enters 
the 

bulk of dual-match play, the 
continued success of its No. 1 
doubles team will go a long way 
toward helping the team secure 
more victories.

“That doubles point is big,” 

Bernstein said. “It’s a lot easier 
to win three singles matches as 
opposed to four. We work on it 
a ton. But to have our top team 
in the lineup doing so well takes 
some pressure off the other 
kids.”

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Jackson’s hot hand leads ‘M’

By AZALEA HINOJOSA

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team fought for a hard-earned 
win against Colgate (0-1) on 
Sunday, just barely slipping past 
the Raiders, 9-8.

The Wolverines (1-1) will be 

losing one of their key players 
when the season comes to a close. 
But until then, senior attackman 
Kyle Jackson continues to lead the 
offense.

Jackson, 
who 
started 
at 

midfield for three seasons, has 
already found success in his new 
role as an attackman — tallying 
eight goals in just two games. In 
the season opener against North 
Carolina, Jackson matched his 
career high of four goals, and did 
it once again in the matchup with 
Colgate.

Twenty seconds after junior 

midfielder Mikie Schlosser scored 
the first goal of the game, Jackson 
netted one of his own. By the end 
of the first quarter, Michigan led, 

4-1, with Jackson scoring on two 
quick shots.

The Ontario, Canada, native 

is used to the toughness that 
accompanies the contact sport, 
so when a player on the opposing 
team initiated a quarrel by 
walking up to him and giving a 
slight push, Jackson used it as 
motivation.

“There was 

frustration on 
both 
ends,” 

Jackson said. 
“But 
I 
like 

a 
little 
bit 

of 
physical 

activity. 
It 

makes it a little more enjoyable for 
me.”

Throughout the game, Jackson 

fought hard for the ball and raced 
around the net in search of the 
perfect 
scoring 
opportunity. 

The 5-foot-9 attackman found 
himself scrambling among 6-foot 
defenders, 
which 
occasionally 

resulted in a few tough hits to the 
turf.

As the third quarter came to a 

close, Schlosser calmly cradled 
the ball down the field before 
realizing the clock had just 10 
seconds left on it. At that point, 
he quickly cleared the ball down 
to the goal at the opposite end, 
where his teammates anxiously 
waited. Jackson, who was just a 

few feet away 
from the goal, 
stretched 
his 
stick 
out 

to 
catch 
the 

ball, and took 
a shot as he 
was falling to 
the ground — 

notching his third goal of the 
match.

Known by his coaches and 

teammates as “K.J.”, Jackson was 
listed as one of three Wolverines 
on the Big Ten Preseason Players 
to Watch list. His dominant 
performances thus far have made 
it hard to miss him on the field.

But Jackson isn’t focused on the 

statistics he achieves individually. 

Instead, what matters most to him 
is the growth of the team.

“Personal 
accomplishments 

don’t mean a whole lot to me,” 
Jackson said. “But as a team with 
a great win like this, that’s more 
than I could really ask for.”

Senior 
midfielder 
Mike 

Hernandez notched a goal of his 
own but took the time to give 
credit where it was due.

“We just let K.J. be K.J.,” 

Hernandez 
said. 
“He 
makes 

things happen for himself. He’s so 
versatile and good with the ball.”

Added Michigan coach John 

Paul: “(Jackson’s) so explosive. 
He’s got such an incredible stick 
and sense around the goal. It just 
adds a dimension in that lefty spot 
that we haven’t had.”

This win marks the first of its 

kind in program history, as the 
Wolverines have never defeated 
a ranked team. Jackson and his 
teammates are hopeful that this 
will be just one of many program-
defining wins as the season 
unfolds.

SINDUJA KILARU/Daily

Senior attackman Kyle Jackson has scored four goals in each of Michigan’s first two games this season, including four against Colgate over the weekend.

“We just let K.J. 

be K.J.”

LeVert: “I was thinking positive”

By SIMON KAUFMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Despite injuring his lower left 

leg in December and potentially 
hurting his future NBA Draft 
stock, Caris LeVert said he never 
worried during his recovery.

Monday, 
two 
days 
after 

returning 
to 
action 
in 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
win against Purdue on Saturday, 
the senior guard addressed the 
media for the first time since his 
Dec. 30 injury at Illinois. The left-
leg injury sidelined LeVert for 11 
games.

The injury occurred late in the 

second half of Michigan’s game 
in Champaign when LeVert’s left 
foot landed on the foot of an Illini 
player as he drove toward the 
basket.

“It was definitely a little scary 

when it happened,” LeVert said. 
“It was a bang-bang play. It was 
kind of sore after the game, but, 
you know, God doesn’t make 
mistakes. I wasn’t too worried 
about it, just worried about how I 
could get better from it.”

Following the injury, Michigan 

coach John Beilein said LeVert’s 
road to recovery would be a day-
to-day process but never gave 
specific details regarding the 
timetable of his return or any 
information regarding the injury.

Asked if not discussing the 

details of the injury was a matter 
of protecting his draft stock, 
LeVert said it was a program 
decision he made with Beilein, his 
mother and the team physician. 
He did confirm that it was a 
rest-only recovery and that no 
operation was performed on his 
leg.

In his first game back Saturday, 

LeVert came off the bench for 
the first time since his freshman 
season. He logged 11 minutes — 
all in the first half — took only 
one field-goal attempt and a free 
throw, both of which he missed, 
and collected five rebounds.

LeVert gave a few reasons for 

his unimpressive performance 

against Purdue.

“I haven’t played in about six 

weeks,” LeVert said. “I was a little 
nervous getting back out there, 
and just game flow. I really don’t 
have a great rhythm right now, but 
it’s coming back to me.”

He did say he was sore 

afterward, 
but 
Michigan’s 

co-captain said the pain was more 
from just playing and not specific 
to his left leg.

“It’s just soreness like with 

playing,” LeVert said. “If you 
don’t do something for six weeks, 
your body’s going to be sore, so 
I’d say that’s the majority of my 
soreness.”

LeVert said he does plan to play 

Tuesday against Ohio State, but 
that going forward, his playing 
time would be a game-time 
decision. Saturday, he didn’t know 
if he’d be able to play until after 
the pregame warmups.

Beilein said that, in the future, 

they’ll reevaluate his ability to 

play each day.

“Pain is still going to be his 

guide,” Beilein said. “If he’s 
feeling any soreness anywhere in 
his body, right now, we’ll pull him 
out and wait. This is important 
that he takes his time in getting 
back to full strength.”

During his absence, sophomore 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman replaced him in the 
starting lineup and paced 10 
points per game during that 
time. Meanwhile, junior guard 
Zak Irvin has begun to find his 
shooting touch after starting the 
season off streaky, and junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. has been 
capable of stepping up when the 
Wolverines need him most.

Michigan’s play during LeVert’s 

absence — including wins over 
then-No. 3 Maryland and then-
No. 18 Purdue — make game 
planning for future opponents 
difficult given the fluidity that the 
lineup has now.

“We have these sets of plays run 

for different people, depending on 
how they’re playing us,” Beilein 
said. “It gets to be this huge 
puzzle. … So now you’re going into 
a game, and you don’t know if he 
can play or not. It’s frankly not 
smooth right now, because we’re 
just trying to get him back.”

During the recovery, LeVert 

admitted his lowest point was 
during the week that Michigan 
played Indiana and Michigan 
State. He didn’t get to play those 
teams last year, either, as he was 
sidelined following a foot surgery. 
Still, though, he said he never had 
any regrets about coming back 
this year and didn’t get worried 
about what this year’s injury 
might do to a potential future 
NBA career.

“I wasn’t thinking that way the 

whole time,” LeVert said. “I was 
thinking positive. You know that’s 
what I came back for my senior 
year for, to play in games.”

Tate remembers 
bond with LeVert

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

Tuesday, the Michigan men’s 

basketball team (9-4 Big Ten, 19-7 
overall) will travel to Columbus to 
take on a middling Ohio State team 
that 
has 

only one 
win in the 
top-100 
RPI. 

The 

Buckeyes’ 
less-
than-ideal start to the season 
included consecutive losses to 
UT Arlington, Louisiana Tech 
and Memphis in November, after 
losing star guard D’Angelo Russell 
to the NBA Draft following last 
season. 

Now, with Russell gone, the 

team’s leadership has fallen on 
sophomore 
forward 
Jae’Sean 

Tate and junior forward Marc 
Loving. 

Tate has done his part to 

keep the Buckeyes (8-5, 16-10) 
competitive, scoring 11.5 points 
per game in addition to Loving’s 
12.5 points per game. Though Ohio 
State has been far from consistent, 
it has played tough recently, 
winning four of its last six Big Ten 
games. 

The Daily sat down with Tate 

— who has started every game 
this season for the Buckeyes — at 
Big Ten Media Day in October 
to discuss former high school 
teammate and current rival Caris 
LeVert, the unknown potential for 
a young Ohio State team and Tate’s 
expected contribution as a team 
leader. 

The Michigan Daily: I know 

that you were a teammate of Caris 
LeVert’s in high school. I heard a 
story about how he took a shot at 
the buzzer, and you tipped it in, 
and your team won 64-62 for the 
state title. What’s your relationship 
with Caris like?

Jae’Sean Tate: Me and Caris 

went to high school together; 
we won a state championship 
together. But I’ve been watching 
Caris since I was in about the 
seventh or eighth grade. Just to 
see him progress and where he 
came from — it’s crazy. I promise 
you, I kid you not, he could not 
dunk his sophomore year in high 
school and then he just worked 
over the summer and, I mean, he 
just went through the roof. He 
got blessed to get a scholarship to 
Michigan, and he’s taken off ever 
since. 

TMD: Are there any hard 

feelings there because of the 
rivalry?

JT: I’ve run into him a couple 

times while I’ve been (at Ohio 
State). It’s always good to catch 
up with old friends. That’s like my 
brother.

TMD: You said that you 

remember seeing him play in 
seventh and eighth grade. Did 
you ever play with him at that 
young of an age?

JT: No, he’s about three years 

older than me, so I would just 
watch him play against the older 
guys … (Our competition level 
has) always been high. Just to 
play against him his last year, 
and he’s finally healthy, I’m 
looking forward to it.

TMD: Earlier today, Ohio 

State 
coach 
Thad 
Matta 

mentioned that you were going to 
have to be a big part of this team. 
Is that a lot of pressure?

JT: I wouldn’t say a lot of 

pressure, because I feel like 
history 
repeats 
itself. 
Like 

I said, with me and Caris, 
that year we won the state 
championship, 
he 
left, 
and 

then I was the older guy. A few 
years later, I’m in the same 
position, where I’m on a young 
team and I have to be a leader, 
so I’m prepared for it, and I’m 
accepting it now. 

BEHIND
ENEMY
LINES

Five things: ‘M’ tops Badgers

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

was 27 seconds away from 
coming out of Madison with six 
points.

Instead, Wisconsin forward 

Cameron Hughes found fellow 
forward Luke Kunin alone on 
the back post, where he ripped a 
one-timer past Wolverine senior 
goaltender Steve Racine to knot 
the game at four in the dying 
moments of regulation.

The two teams played to a 

scoreless overtime period before 
Michigan won the shootout, 1-0, 
with three saves from Racine 
and a goal from junior forward 
JT Compher.

The shootout win left the 

Wolverines with two of three 
possible points from the game 
and five of six points on the 
weekend. After being tied for 
first with Minnesota in the Big 
Ten standings coming into the 
weekend, the Gophers took over 
sole possession of first place 
with a clean sweep of Ohio State.

Here are five things we 

learned from Michigan’s trip to 
Madison this past weekend.

1. Once again, Racine is 

strong between the pipes.

The Wolverines rarely get 

outshot. 
But 
on 
Saturday, 

Wisconsin outshot Michigan, 
44-33.

Usually, this doesn’t bode well 

for the Wolverines. Racine was 
up to the task all night, though, 
stopping 40 shots as well as all 
three penalty shots.

Even on Friday, Racine bailed 

Michigan out multiple times 
on odd-man rushes to keep the 
game out of the Badgers’ reach.

Overall, Racine stopped 60 

shots, and after his outing last 
week against Michigan State, 
where he stopped 71 shots in two 
games, his performance bodes 
well for the Wolverines as the 
season’s finish line nears.

2. The defense is still a work 

in progress.

If you think you’ve heard this 

line before this season, chances 
are, you probably have. The 
Wolverines give up an average 
of three goals per game and are 

ranked 39th nationally out of 60 
teams in team defense.

One of Michigan’s problems 

this 
season 
has 
been 
its 

tendency to give up odd-man 
rushes. 
That 
problem 
was 

evident again this weekend, 
but Racine was able to limit the 
damage for the Wolverines in 
most scenarios.

However, 
giving 
up 
four 

goals in one game to a team that 
averages 2.62 goals per game 
is concerning, and Michigan 
knows that work is needed on 
the defensive end.

3. The CCM line is pretty 

good.

Yeah, I know, you already 

knew this.

But week in, week out, the 

forward line of Compher, junior 
Tyler 
Motte 
and 
freshman 

Kyle Connor continues to score 
points, and bushels of them.

This 
weekend, 
the 
trio 

combined for 12 points (five 
goals, seven assists) and was 
responsible for 55 percent of 
Michigan’s goals.

4. Dancs thrives on second 

line.

After 
freshman 
forward 

Cooper Marody came down 
with mononucleosis, Michigan 
coach Red Berenson was forced 
to switch up his lines. Senior 
forward Justin Selman was 
moved into Marody’s spot on 
the third line, and sophomore 
forward 
Dexter 
Dancs 
was 

moved up from the fourth line.

And in that time, he has 

played well.

Dancs has tallied two goals 

and an assist, and has a plus-
minus of +2 since his move to the 
second line.

His goal Friday proved to be 

the game winner in Michigan’s 
4-1 victory.

5. Bold prediction: Someone 

on the CCM line will win the 
Hobey Baker Award.

Currently, Connor leads the 

nation in scoring with 48 points. 
But just five points behind him 
is Compher. And just a point 
behind Compher is Motte. 

In 
comparison, 
former 

Michigan forward Zach Hyman 
led the team last season with 
54 points, while forward Dylan 
Larkin, who currently plays in 
the National Hockey League 
with the Detroit Red Wings, 
finished with 47 points.

With at least eight games left 

in the season, it isn’t out of the 
realm of possibility that all three 
players could pass Hyman’s 
total.

In 
addition, 
Motte 
and 

Connor are No. 1 and 2 in the 
goals category, while Compher 
and Connor are No. 2 and 3 in 
the assists column.

While it isn’t obvious which 

player on the line is in the best 
position to win it, all three 
should be in good consideration 
for the award. 

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Senior goalie Steve Racine has seen a resurgence of late between the pipes.

Thompson’s defense key to 
Wolverines success of late

Junior guard shuts 
down opponents’ 
big guns with skill, 

not size.

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Siera Thompson is best known 

for knocking down 3-pointers 
and doling out assists, but it’s 
her defense that has been crucial 
to winning games.

The junior guard on the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team has shut down opponents’ 
best players all season, and 
lately, she has begun to show 
how important that truly is.

Just two weeks ago, on 

Jan. 31, she forced Minnesota 
guard Rachel Banham to post 
a 1-for-10 effort from 3-point 
territory — Banham went on 
to tie the NCAA single-game 
scoring record with 60 points 
just a week later. And on Feb. 11, 
against Wisconsin, Thompson 
matched up with the Badgers’ 
best 
player, 
guard 
Nicole 

Bauman, and held her to just 10 
points.

Thompson’s defensive skillset 

doesn’t come from a menacing 
height or long wingspan, but 
simply her effort and mindset, 
as Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico always says.

She has a meticulous eye 

for opponents’ tendencies and 
studies each with care leading 
up to games.

“It’s my job to get the energy 

going on defense to try and 
stop the opposing team’s best 
players,” Thompson said. “I take 
a lot of pride and try my hardest 
to do that.”

But Thompson hasn’t become 

the Wolverines’ top defender 
by practicing against the likes 
of sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty — the most lethal 
scorer on the team (22.4 points 
per game, 2.4 assists). She 

has reached these heights by 
playing against the boys that 
Michigan scrimmages against 
in practices.

Thompson, at just 5-foot-

7, doesn’t look as dangerous 
as some of Michigan’s other 
options, but the work she puts 
in against the “practice boys” 
makes her just as strong.

“Usually 
whoever 
is 
the 

best one, I’m guarding him,” 
Thompson said. “If you can 
guard the boys, you can guard 
almost anyone 
of our girls, 
because 
(the 

boys) are so 
athletic.”

Playing 

against 
boys 

is 
common 

practice 
for 

women’s 
teams 
around 
the 

NCAA, allowing teams to gain 
experience against players with 
different physical advantages 
than they would be able to find 
in a reserve team made up of 
girls.

“Defense — so much is effort, 

and so much is toughness,” 
Barnes Arico said. “(Thompson) 
has that probably more than 
anybody on our team. I wish that 
some of that defensive effort 
would rub off on everybody 
else.”

Michigan’s 
defense 
gives 

up an average of 70.5 points, 
the eighth-best in the Big Ten. 
Eighth out of a 14-team pool 
puts the Wolverines (7-7 Big 
Ten, 15-10 overall) in the middle 
of the pack, but it’s below the 
standard Michigan hopes to 
reach. 

Thompson, though, is setting 

the pace, and she has earned 
Barnes Arico’s full trust in that 
realm.

But while going head to head 

with 
the 
Badgers’ 
Bauman, 

Thompson 
recorded 
four 

personal fouls, one of the few 
times this season she has been in 

danger of fouling out.

It would have been far easier 

to just foul players like Bauman 
and 
Banham 
in 
pressure 

situations and force them to 
convert from the free-throw line, 
but Thompson is experienced 
enough — and Barnes Arico 
trusted her enough — to play 
smart without picking up a fifth 
foul.

“Some games you have to feel 

out the refs,” Thompson said. 
“Sometimes they call more fouls 

than 
other 

games. That’s 
something 
I 

have to adjust 
to.”

The 

Wolverines 
wouldn’t 
have been as 
successful on 
the 
offensive 

or 
defensive 

end if Thompson weren’t in the 
game. 

“She needed to stay in at that 

point,” Barnes Arico said.

Lately, 
her 
defensive 

presence has been matched 
with an equally strong stint 
on offense, too. In Michigan’s 
current three-game win streak, 
Thompson is pacing 13.3 points 
per contest. Stops on defense 
lead to transition scoring, and 
her team-high 34 steals continue 
to boost the Wolverines.

Thompson 
will 
face 
the 

challenge of stopping Shatori 
Walker-Kimbrough this week, 
in a rematch of the Jan. 14 close 
loss to then-No. 8 Maryland. The 
Terrapins’ guard is averaging 
20.5 points through 14 Big Ten 
games.

Last time she met with 

Michigan, she put up 15. This 
time, both teams have more on 
the line. Thompson will have to 
do more to stop her, and Walker-
Kimbrough will have to do more 
to score.

It’s just another opportunity 

for Thompson to pad her already 
impressive defensive resume.

KICKER

“It’s my job to 

get the 

energy going 
on defense.”
