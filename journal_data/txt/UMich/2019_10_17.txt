The 
Michigan 
Union 
celebrated its centennial on 
Wednesday with cupcakes and 
a birthday card on the Diag. The 
Union has been a gathering space 
for students on campus since its 
creation in 1919, but the building 
has been under construction and 

closed to visitors since April 2018. 
The 
Center 
for 
Campus 
Involvement hosted the event. 
LSA senior Sarah Hussain works 
as a program coordinator team 
lead with the Center for Campus 
Involvement. She said despite 
the building not being open on 
its 100th year of existence on 
campus, the center felt it was 
important to keep the Union 
alive in students’ minds while 

undergoing construction.
 “We knew that the 100th 
birthday was coming up and as 
a committee we all talked about 
some things we can do to keep 
its memory alive and get people 
excited about the reopening and 
keep it on the forefront of people’s 
minds, especially knowing that 
we have a couple grades of classes 
who have maybe never even 
been in the Union as a student 

here, so we wanted to keep it 
relevant,” Hussain said. 
“Knowing that it was going to 
turn 100 while it was closed, we 
decided we wanted to do at least 
something to commemorate that, 
so I just helped generate some ideas 
signing the birthday cards and 
having the block M out here for 
people to talk about.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In an effort to prevent 
school violence across the 
country, the University of 
Michigan School of Public 
Health plans to host a $6 
million national research 
and 
training 
center 
on 
school 
safety 
and 
gun violence. The new 
center’s goal is to provide 
schools with training and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
eliminate the threat to 
student safety. 

The new center will 
be funded by the Bureau 
of 
Justice 
Assistance 
at the U.S. Department 
of Justice in hopes of 
providing 
a 
resource 
for the Bureau’s funded 
projects, as well as for 
other 
schools 
around 
the 
country. 
This 
multidisciplinary 
and 
multi-institutional center 
will gather faculty and 
staff from top schools of 
public health, criminal 
justice 
and 
education, 
as 
well 
school 
safety 

professionals 
and 
experts 
in 
evidence-
based 
practices, 
law 
enforcement, 
crisis 
intervention, 
violence 
prevention 
and 
mental 
health. 
Contributors 
to 
the 
center 
include 
the 
Sandy 
Hook 
Promise 
Foundation, 
University 
of 
Virginia, 
Michigan 
State University, National 
Council 
of 
Behavioral 
Health, 
Association 
of 
School 
Superintendents 
and National Association 

of 
Elementary 
School 
Principals, among others. 
Marc 
Zimmerman, 
co-principal investigator 
at the center and the 
Marshal 
H. 
Becker 
Collegiate 
professor 
of health behavior and 
health education at the 
U-M 
School 
of 
Public 
Health, 
explained 
the 
center 
will 
focus 
its 
research and training on 
prevention 
tactics 
and 
notification technology.

On 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
hundreds of students, faculty and 
staff convened in the Michigan 
League Ballroom for an update on 
the University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion Strategic Plan from 
Robert Sellers, Vice Provost for 
Equity and Inclusion and Chief 
Diversity Officer for the University. 
The event, titled “Community 
Conversation: DEI ProgressUpdate,” 
focused on the University’s progress 
in regards to DEI. The session 
updated attendees on the progress of 
the University’s five-year DEI Plan, 
which is now in its third year. 
The strategic plan was launched 
in 2016. It features one broad 
university-level plan and 49 unit-
level plans, specific to University 
programs and schools. The plan 
has three central goals: fostering 
an inclusive and equitable campus 
climate; creating a more diverse 
community of students, faculty 
and staff; and infusing diversity in 
scholarship and teaching. 
Sellers 
began 
the 
talk 
by 
summarizing the plan’s overall goal: 
impactful change. 
“Our 
plan 
is 
long 
term, 
sustainable, institutional, cultural 
change — the change being making 
the University a more diverse, 
equitable and inclusive community,”

Women Also Know Law, a 
new 
initiative 
spearheaded 
by University of Michigan 
Law School faculty, aims to 
create more representation of 
those who identify as women 
or gender nonconforming in 
legal academia.
The project includes two 
online platforms. The first, a 
searchable database currently 
in the works, will include 
those who have or are seeking 
an 
academic 
appointment 
in 
legal 
education 
who 
identify as women or gender 
nonconforming. The initiative 
also uses a Twitter account, 
@womenknowlaw, 
to 
highlight the achievements 
and 
knowledge 
of 
women 
and 
gender 
nonconforming 
individuals in the legal field.
Assistant 
Law 
Professor 
Leah 
Litman 
and 
Emily 
Prifogle, 
visiting 
assistant 
law professor, co-founded the 
initiative. Litman said the 
public database will provide 
the opportunity to easily find 
experts in a given area of 
law for individuals looking 
to build curriculum or find 
speakers for a conference or 
panel.

The renovated Michigan 
Union will feature a Panera 
Bread and a Sweetwaters 
Coffee & Tea, among other 
options, when it reopens 
in January.
Several 
restaurants 
previously 
housed 
in 
the 
Union, 
including 
Starbucks and Au Bon 
Pain, will not be returning. 
ButPanda 
Express 
and 
Subway will keep their 
spots in the Union with 
the 
addition 
of 
Mama 
Deluca’s, a station offering 
made-to-order 
pizza, 
pasta and chicken wings. 
The other six restaurants 
will include MI Burger 
and the convenience store 
Blue Market. All of the 
restaurants 
will 
accept 
Blue Bucks and Dining 
Dollars. 
The 
renovated 
Union 

will also house five retail 
partners: Barnes & Noble, 
the U-M Credit Union, the 
U-M Tech Shop, PNC ATM 
and the Michigan Union 
Ticket Office.
In 
an 
interview 
with The Daily, Susan 
Pile, senior director of 
University 
Unions 
and 
Auxiliary Services, said 
there was a multipronged 
approach to considering 
restaurants’ bids for space 
in the Union.
“I think the criteria has 
been, what is going to be 
of interest to students, 
the price point, the menu 
selection, 
customer 
service, who’s going to 
operate a good business 
that’s going to meet the 
needs of all those folks 
that 
visit 
the 
Union,” 
Pile said. “So I think that 
those are the key drivers.”

In 
response 
to 
growing 
concern 
regarding 
per-and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
(PFAS), the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention and 
Michigan’s 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services 
announced in September they 
will begin working together to 
determine the harmful health 
effects of PFAS in drinking water 
on Michigan residents.
PFAS are a wide variety 
of 
chemicals 
produced 
by 
manufacturing, 
industrial 
and agricultural processes. In 
Michigan and some other states 
across the country, PFAS is a 
growing threat to drinking water. 
Ann Arbor residents have become 

increasingly concerned with the 
levels of PFAS contamination in 
Washtenaw County, especially 
in the Huron River. Last May, 
the city launched a transparency 
initiative to detail updates on 
water quality. 
The state of Michigan has 
more sites contaminated with 
PFAS than any other in the 
United States. As a result, the 
CDC and DHHS will examine 
PFAS exposure in Parchment/
Cooper Township and North 
Kent County. 
In a September press release, 
Patrick 
Breysse, 
director 
of 
the CDC’s National Center for 
Environmental Health, said the 
effort would help researchers 
learn more about the effects of 
PFAS exposure.
“There 
is 
much 
that 
is 

unknown about the health effects 
of exposure to these chemicals,” 
Breysse wrote. “The multi-site 
study will advance the scientific 
evidence on the human health 
effects of PFAS and provide some 
answers to communities exposed 
to the contaminated drinking 
water.”
Terese Olson, professor of civil 
and environmental engineering, 
said PFAS contamination is 
ultimately a sustainability issue.
“Here you have emissions 
of these compounds in the 
environment that aren’t going to 
go anywhere,” Olson said. “And 
(they) will only build up. It makes 
no sense. It’s unsustainable.”
Due to PFAS resistance to 
things like grease and water, 
PFAS have been used for stain-
resistant materials and cleaning 
products. 
However, 
because of their incredibly 
strong 
carbon-fluorine 
bonds, PFAS are not easily 
broken down, leading to 
elevated levels of PFAS 
in food, water, and the 
human body. Exposure 
to PFAS could increase 
cancer risk and cholesterol 
levels, as well as impede 
child development. 
Of the 30 groundwater 
samples taken in Saline at 
the Washtenaw Industrial 
Facility, 24 were reported 
to have PFAS levels either 
greater than or equal to the 
standard allowed by the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency, which is 70 parts 
per trillion. 
These high levels are 
not restricted to Saline. 
For 
LSA 
senior 
Tyler 
Schaub, this news hit close 
to home. His hometown 
of Muskegon has also 
experienced levels much 
higher 
than 
the 
EPA 
standard. 
“I’m 
originally 

from 
Muskegon, 
Michigan,” 
Schaub said. “And there’s been 
households 
in 
Muskegon, 
Michigan, that have had (levels) 
up to 400 plus.”
 The city has provided water 
bottles and filters to some of the 
homes affected. Olson explained 
how different cities react to PFAS 
contamination, such as the city 
of Parchment switching over to 
Kalamazoo’s water sources. 
 “There’s also even community 
systems that have discovered 
that there’s a contamination 
source, and their levels were 
higher than what they realize 
or what they thought,” Olson 
said. “And in those cases the 
city of Parchment was one such 
city; what they did was abandon 
their water source and hook 
up to the city of Kalamazoo. So 
communities have adjusted to 
these situations in various ways 
depending on how it’s surfaced.”
In spite of these adjustments, 
the lingering damage of PFAS 
ingested 
by 
humans 
and 
accumulated by the environment 
is a pressing concern.
LSA 
junior 
Luke 
McGill, 
who is studying environmental 
science, 
echoed 
the 
unease 
regarding facing the unknown.
“We 
know 
it’s 
in 
the 
environment and can get into our 
drinking water, and like you said 
it’s above EPA standards in some 
places,” McGill said. “We just 
don’t know what that’s going to 
do. So I think that’s concerning 
that it’s already in us or it already 
has the possibility to affect us.”
The 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor, 
however, has been proactive 
regarding the safety of its 
drinking 
water 
by 
utilizing 
granular activated carbon to 
maintain the city’s PFAS levels, 
which are currently below 10 ppt.

“We’re trying to avoid a 
situation in which the same 
group of people tend to get 
invited or quoted in all of 
the different pieces and 
make it easier to erase the 
excuse of, ‘I didn’t know any 
women to appear on this 
panel or this conference, or 
to consult for this particular 
project,’” Litman said. 
While the database is still 
being created, the Twitter 
account has been in use 
since Oct. 1. Prifogle said the 
account is used to showcase 
the diversity of scholarship 
women 
and 
gender 
nonconforming people have 
in the discipline.
“Women don’t promote 
themselves in the same way 
that men might promote 
themselves,” 
Prifogle 
said. “We can do some of 
that promotional work for 
them, we can amplify their 
scholarship, we can amplify 
awards that they have won 
and bring greater attention 
to their work.”
The initiative is inspired 
by 
Women 
Also 
Know 
Stuff, a similar database 
and corresponding Twitter 
account of political science 
experts 
who 
identify 
as 
women 
or 
gender 
nonconforming. 
Prifogle 
was a member of a group 
which formed an additional 
database 
and 
Twitter 
account 
for 
historians 
identifying as women and 
gender 
nonconforming 
individuals called Women 
Also Know History, which 
is also based off of Women 
Also Know Stuff. Though 
the three initiatives are not 
in an official partnership, 
Litman explained, Women 
Also Know Law has been in 
contact with the others and 
has received support from 
them along the way.
In addition to Litman and 
Prifogle, Women Also Know 
Law has a faculty advisory 
board 
consisting 
of 
11 
University law professors 

who 
help 
manage 
the 
Twitter account, generate 
ideas for website content 
and publicize the initiative. 
A group of students from 
the Women Law Students 
Association 
collaborate 
with the faculty advisory 
board on the projects.
Second-year Law students 
Rachel 
Czwartacky 
and 
Emma 
Macfarlane 
are 
co-presidents of the Women 
Law Students Association 
and both became involved 
with Women Also Know 
Law when Litman reached 
out 
to 
them 
about 
the 
initiative at the beginning 
of the semester.
Czwartacky 
and 
Macfarlane said they are 
both looking forward to 
the impact of the initiative. 
From her involvement in 
Women Also Know Law, 
Czwartacky said she has 
gotten 
the 
opportunity 
to work with influential 
female law professors that 
she 
wouldn’t 
have 
met 
otherwise.
“There 
are 
so 
many 
panels that go on in the 
law school all the time 
that are all put on by 
different student groups,” 
Czwartacky said. “Even just 
between 
(Mcfarlane 
and 
me), we’re always thinking 
about 
whose 
voices 
are 
represented on these panels 
… (Women Also Know Law) 
is really perfect for both 
of us. And I think that was 
something we were looking 
to do.”
Before 
coming 
to 
law 
school at the University, 
Macfarlane 
taught 
in 
Bangkok, 
Thailand, 
for 
two years. Working in a 
very male-dominated field, 
Macfarlane said she found 
importance 
in 
having 
female 
role 
models 
and 
experts to look up to.
“It’s difficult to make 
your way when you don’t 
have people immediately at 
the forefront of your brain 
to look up to,” Macfarlane 
said. “I think that this 
is an excellent project to 
highlight people and maybe 

encourage the default be 
not a white man, but a 
woman or a person of color, 
or a person who is gender 
nonconforming.”
Litman 
said 
those 
involved 
in 
the 
Women 
Also Know Law initiative 
want the project to be used 
as a positive reinforcement 
and support tool for those 
who 
identify 
as 
women 
and gender nonconforming 
in law academia. She also 
hopes 
those 
considering 
entering 
academia 
can 
utilize the initiative to see 
the great work they can go 
on to do.
“We want to change the 
look and feel about what it 
means to be experts and to 
be supporting women who 
are doing amazing things 
in 
the 
law 
(field), 
and 
also 
encouraging 
people, 
reminding them about all of 
the amazing experts in the 
field who identify as women 
or gender nonconforming,” 
Litman said.
Prifogle said she wants 
Women Also Know Law 
to 
start 
a 
productive 

conversation 
about 

including 
more 
diversity 
in the field and bringing 
women 
and 
gender 
nonconforming 
voices 
to 
the 
foreground 
of 
legal 
academia.
“I 
hope 
for 
more 
representation of women 
in academia, on conference 
panels and syllabi; I hope 
the 
database 
enables 
greater 
representation 
and greater diversity in 
those key components of 
academic 
life,” 
Prifogle 
said. “But I also hope it 
starts 
a 
conversation 
in 
legal academia about the 
importance 
of 
diversity, 
the importance of tackling 
gender bias. We’re tackling 
gender bias in a couple of 
specific ways that I think 
are modeled on other ways 
that have proven successful, 
but they are not the only 
ways to tackle gender bias. 
And we alone are not going 
to solve gender bias in the 
academy.”

The Union has been closed 
since April 2018, when work 
began on the two-year, $85.2 
million renovation project. 
Students played a role in 
the decision-making process 
through the Michigan Union 
Board 
of 
Representatives, 
a 
student 
organization 
that consulted with Union 
administrators 
on 
the 
renovation. 
Rackham student Timothy 
Williams, 
a 
member 
of 
the MUBR and one of the 
students who served on the 
food review committee, said 
sustainability was a primary 
concern 
in 
considering 
which restaurants to put in 
the Union. 
“I 
know 
for 
a 
lot 
of 
us 
sustainability 
was 
at 
the 
forefront,” 
Williams 
said. “We wanted to avoid 
anything that wasn’t either 
recyclable or compostable, 
keep up with sustainability 
trends, not only in front of 
house but also back of house 
and make sure they’re using 
sustainable equipment and 
composting, et cetera. That 
was a pretty big part of it 
as well as menu diversity, 
which obviously played a 
huge role.” 
Amy 
White, 
director 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Union 
and associate director of 
University 
Unions, 
said 
she was looking forward to 
introducing new restaurants 
into the space.
“I think you’ll see that 
there 
are 
some 
familiar 
favorites, as well as some 
new 
faces 
and 
I 
think 
that’s good,” White said. “I 
think that if we opened the 
renovated Union and the 
same folks that we’ve seen 
for the last 30 years are still 
doing 
business 
that 
says 
something. In some ways 
that says some really good 

things, and it may also say 
some things that are not so 
good, so I think having some 
fresh businesses alongside 
long-standing 
favorites 
is 
something that I’m excited 
about.”
LSA senior Nick Schmidt, 
chair of the Michigan Union 
Board 
of 
Representatives, 
said customer service was 
another consideration. 
“I think that that’s a huge 
part of any operation that we 
have in the Union is making 
sure 
that 
the 
business 
interacts 
well 
with 
the 
students because we want 
students to feel comfortable 
in the Union,” Schmidt said. 
“That is their space.”
The 
current 
contracts 
vary from five to 10 years in 
length. 
Some 
restaurants, 
including 
Wendy’s, 
opted 
not to renew their contracts 
for space in the Union. Last 
January, 
activists 
from 
Washtenaw Solidarity with 
Farmworkers 
called 
on 
the University and Central 
Student 
Government 
to 
block Wendy’s from coming 
back to campus after the 
chain 
refused 
to 
sign 
the 
Fair 
Food 
Program, 
an 
initiative 
seeking 
to 
promote adequate working 
conditions and fair wages 
for agricultural laborers. 
The Wendy’s location in 
the Union was independently 
franchised and the owner 
subsequently decided not to 
renew the lease. 
White said the controversy 
did not impact the selection 
process in a significant way.
“I think we didn’t see a 
huge amount of controversy 
from individual vendors,” 
White said.
Williams 
agreed 
with 
White, adding “at the end 
of the day, we picked them 
because we thought they 
were all the best.”
“It 
was 
definitely 
in 
the back of my mind, just 

because it was so prevalent 
on campus, but by and large, 
we just didn’t run into that 
with businesses that we 
looked at in my opinion,” 
Williams said. “We asked 
about food sourcing for a 
sustainability 
perspective, 
more so than that particular 
concern. As far as I’m aware, 
it just never really came up.”
Apart from food, Schmidt 
said he was looking forward 
to seeing students return 
to 
the 
Union 
after 
its 
renovation.
“I mean, in my opinion, the 
open inviting space and the 
vibrancy of collaboration is 
something I’m excited for,” 
Schmidt said. “I’m excited 
to go into the Union and 
hear people talking and see 
people laughing and things 
like that.”
Williams 
noted 
the 
renovation will also enclose 
the courtyard on the main 
level, creating more space 
for students.
“I’m 
really 
excited 
about the new courtyard,” 
Williams 
said. 
“I 
think 
it’s going to be beautiful. 
It’ll be actually usable for 
most of the year, instead of 
freezing out there.”
The enclosed courtyard 
will be near the IdeaHub, 
a 
co-working 
space 
for 
student collaboration that 
will be built where the 
97-year-old billiards hall 
previously stood. 
Pile said she was excited 
to see the Union come alive 
again and watch students 
use the IdeaHub.
 “It’s going to be this 
amazing 
new 
space 
for 
student organizations on 
campus, really unlike any 
other space that we’ve ever 
seen on campus just for 
student organizations,” Pile 
said. “So it’s exciting to 
think about moving into that 
space and what it’s going to 
mean for student orgs on 
this campus.”

Sellers said. “I think it’s 
important 
that 
we 
start 
there, to understand that we 
are talking about cultural 
change.”
Sellers went on to discuss 
that while achieving change 
is not easy, the long-term 
benefits render it crucial to 
maintaining a reputation of 
greatness at the University. 
“By definition, that requires 
hard work,” Sellers said. “It 
means that the work has to 
be 
pervasive 
throughout 
the 
organization. 
It 
will 
take time… It also means 
the 
change 
must 
happen 
at 
multiple 
levels 
of 
the 
University… if we are going to 
make long term sustainable 
change.”
LSA senior Kyle Duffy said 
he attended the event because 
of his job on campus at the 
Office 
for 
Organizational 
Culture and Strategy. 
“A huge importance of our 
work is based on DEI,” Duffy 
said. “So, a big part of the DEI 
for the business and finance 
department is knowing what’s 
going 
on 
around 
campus. 
We came here to figure out 
what’s been going on… I am 
just interested to see what’s 
different.” 
Sellers went on to discuss 
specific points of progress 
within the plan. He explained 
the plan was implemented in 
conjunction 
with 
feedback 

his team had received from 
community members within 
the University. 
Currently, 
there 
are 
37 
action 
items 
taking 
place 
within the DEI plan. The 
items 
specifically 
target 
areas 
such 
as 
raising 
institutional 
awareness; 
aligning 
University 
policy, 
procedures 
and 
programs 
with 
DEI 
initiatives; 
creating 
inclusive 
cultural 
norms; 
and 
broadening 
institutional access. Sellers 
noted they were formulated 
through individuals’ direct 
participation at every level of 
the University. He said they 
did not come from personal 
directives from any University 
officials such as University 
President Mark Schlissel.
“These were not top-down 
handed initiatives,” Sellers 
said. “These action items were 
all developed from the initial 
planning 
process 
through 
focus 
groups, 
through 
social media opportunities… 
through town hall meetings 
and other kinds of meetings. 
These are not the president’s 
action 
items, 
these 
are 
definitely not my action items, 
these are action items that 
you all developed yourselves.” 
Sellers went on to discuss 
specific points of empirical 
evidence the strategic plan 
has made significant changes 
at the University. 
Rhonda Todd, director of 
academic success at the Ross 
School of Business, told The 
Daily she was motivated to 

attend the event in an effort 
to see the impact of the DEI 
initiative across campus. 
“The work I do for the Ross 
School of Business revolves 
around 
DEI, 
supporting 
students’ academic success,” 
Todd said. “I am always really 
busy in that building, and I 
wanted to consciously make 
myself get out of the building 
to get more on campus and get 
more involved with DEI work 
across campus, not just in our 
building.” 
She went on to discuss how, 
from her perspective, DEI 
initiatives are most successful 
when 
subunits, 
like 
the 
Business School, commit not 
only to internal improvements 
but think about changes in 
the context of the larger 
University. 
“DEI 
is 
important, 
necessary work,” Todd said. 
“Although we are making 
strides 
within 
our 
Ross 
community, it’s important to 
me to also be involved in the 
big picture. To do that, I must 
conscientiously engage.” 
Sellers 
concluded 
the 
discussion 
by 
announcing 
while areas for improvement 
certainly still exist, the plan 
has helped the University take 
steps forward.
“We understand that we 
have 
made 
a 
difference, 
and we are not the same 
University that we were at the 
start of this process,” Sellers 
said. “We still have a ways to 
go, but we are not where we 
were when we started.”

Hussain 
is 
also 
on 
the 
symbolic 
programming 
committee, which works to 
bring awareness to the historic 
past 
of 
the 
buildings 
on 
campus, while also celebrating 
the 
milestones 
of 
these 
buildings. 
The committee put on events 
for the closing of the Union in 
2018, as well as a halfway point 
of construction, which Hussain 
said were especially important 
to her because of how much 
she loved the Union. She spent 

many hours absorbed in her 
studies in the Union prior to its 
reconstruction.
“The sophomore year that I 
spent 17 hours in the building 
one day… I loved the Union,” 
Hussain 
said. 
“I 
worked 
there, I would study there, I 
would grab meals there, so it 
definitely was a little hard not 
having it for my whole junior 
year. I’m so happy it’ll be open 
when I graduate.” 
Laura 
Seagram, 
the 
director of account services 
for 
auxiliary 
marketing 
and 
communications 
said 
she 
was 
very 
excited 
to 
help with and attend this 
event. She mentioned that 

the construction plans were 
running earlier than expected.
“We feel really good that 
we can meet that date and we 
had all been saying winter for 
2020 before, but now I think 
we’re comfortable in saying 
this coming January,” Seagram 
said. “It’s exciting.”
LSA 
junior 
Nithin 
Weerasinghe 
discussed 
his 
excitement for the birthday 
celebration as well as the 
reopening of the Union. 
“I think it’’s going to be 
really nice to have it back,” 
Weerasinghe said. “I know a lot 
of people studied there down 
at the cafes and I think a lot of 
clubs also used the space.”

“We want to identify best 
practices around what the 
crisis 
intervention 
teams 
should be doing, what are 
the best practices around 
counseling kids, how quickly 
you get there, what role does 
family play, how long do 
services need to be available,” 
Zimmerman said. “We don’t 
really know what they are 
all yet, by the way. Part of it 
is we are going to learn. We 
have experts who are going 
to help us identify different 
areas, and we are going to try 
to see where the evidence is 
and help get the information 
out to the schools.” 
When 
asked 
how 
the 
bureau will cater to unique 
school 
characteristics, 
Zimmerman discussed the 
complex 
approach 
needed 
to provide schools with a 
tailored set of guidelines 
based on their individual 
situations.
“One of our tasks is to 
identify what are the best 
practices,” Zimmerman said. 
“What we also want to do is 
help schools identify what are 
their resources, and what are 
the needs of their context... 
Absolutely, (we are) thinking 
about 
many 
factors: 
the 
size of school might matter, 
socioeconomic status might 
matter, geographical location 
might matter, the resources 
available to a school might 
matter, 
a 
public 
charter 
might matter. So what we are 
going to try to do is, in a way 
where we can be as helpful as 
possible, identify what their 
place is like and what best 
fits them.”
In addition to his work 
with the center, Zimmerman 
co-leads the Firearm Safety 
Among Children and Teens 
Consortium. 
Launched 
in 
2017, FACTS is a five-year 
project devoted to seeking 
a scientific approach to gun 
violence 
prevention 
with 
respect to gun ownership 
rights. Funded by the Eunice 
Kennedy 
Shriver 
National 

Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development as part 
of the National Institutes of 
Health, the interdisciplinary 
project partners with over 
30 
researchers, 
health 
practitioners 
and 
firearm 
owners, as well as a dozen 
academic institutions. 
These 
efforts 
seek 
to 
address the issue of gun 
violence 
and 
threats 
to 
safety 
in 
American 
schools. According to U-M 
researchers, there has been 
an increase in violence at 
schools: 
The 
number 
of 
shootings in K-12 schools 
increased from 15 to 97 from 
2015 to 2019, and up to one in 
five students reported being 
in a fight in the last year.
Zimmerman said schools 
are in a position to implement 
better 
practices 
or 
more 
evidence-based strategies to 
support students who may be 
experiencing these issues. 
“The idea (of the center) 
is to create a resource that 
will help make a difference 
in making our schools safer 
for kids so they can learn, 
instead of worrying about 
their 
safety,” 
Zimmerman 
said.
As a member of the Warren 
County 
Democrats 
and 
the policy chair of U-M’s 
Roosevelt 
Institute, 
LSA 
junior 
Morgan 
Showen 
said he hopes the center 
will address the legislative 
inaction on gun violence. 
“Efforts 
to 
provide 
education and training to 
protect 
young 
Americans 
from further gun violence 
are always a step in the 
right 
direction,” 
Showen 
said. “However, just like the 
science behind the existence 
of 
climate 
change, 
the 
evidence is settled on which 
solutions have the greatest 
impact 
on 
reducing 
gun 
deaths.” 
Showen 
comes 
from 
Lebanon, Ohio, and noted 
his home state has recently 
received national attention 
after a mass shooting in 
Dayton in August. 
“My hope is that the School 
of Public Health’s new efforts 

will not simply be focused 
on treating the symptoms of 
gun violence, but will instead 
help to enable legislators in 
both Michigan and Ohio to 
take proven actions towards 
addressing the root cause of 
our national gun violence 
epidemic,” Showen said.
LSA senior Taylor King is 
a member of U-M Students 
Demand Action, a student 
organization 
dedicated 
to 
fighting gun violence. King 
said research dedicated to 
gun 
violence 
prevention 
is 
important, 
especially 
following 
the 
passage 
of 
the Dickey Amendment in 
1996, which forbade federal 
funding 
for 
gun 
violence 
prevention research.
“I hope to see this initiative 
take a varied approach to 
gun violence prevention at 
schools — considering not 
only mass shootings, which 
make up less than 1 percent 
of all shootings, but also 
considering gun suicide, daily 
gun violence and the toll it 
takes on young people who 
are impacted — primarily 
low-income 
students 
of 
color — and the mental and 
emotional toll of all gun 
violence on all young people 
and students,” King said. 
King tied the need to fight 
gun violence to social justice 
causes.
“However, I do want to 
highlight that centers like 
this should not be the only 
thing we are doing. While 
school safety is undeniably 
important, we also need to be 
looking into daily gun violence 
and 
its 
disproportionate 
impact on people of color, 
the 
intersection 
of 
gun 
violence 
and 
domestic 
violence, gun suicide, hate 
crimes and the countless 
other manifestations of gun 
violence in our communities,” 
King 
said. 
“There 
is 
a 
tendency for people to only 
think of mass shootings and 
school shootings when we 
talk about gun violence, but 
the problem is so much bigger 
than that and school safety 
campaigns cannot solve all of 
our problems.

How to navigate the gun control fight
T

he issue of guns in 
America 
is 
deeply 
emotional and divisive. 
As the Democratic candidates 
vie for their party’s presidential 
nomination, it is critical that 
they recognize the optics of 
this issue and do not reinforce 
Republican talking points on 
gun confiscation. 
While all the Democratic 
presidential candidates support 
some form of gun control, 
the issue of a mandatory gun 
buyback 
program 
divides 
the 
candidates. 
Sen. 
Cory 
Booker, D-N.J., Sen. Kamala 
Harris, D-Calif., and former 
Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, 
have all announced that, as 
president, they would push for 
a mandatory buyback program 
of 
certain 
semi-automatic 
weapons.
Meanwhile, 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, D-V.T., Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass. and former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden 
have all called for instituting 
a 
voluntary 
gun 
buyback 
program. 
From a purely ideological 
perspective, I strongly support 
a mandatory buyback program 
for 
certain 
semi-automatic 
weapons. I have come to this 
position in the same way that 
many other young people have: 
growing up in an era plagued 
with gun violence. We are tired 
of the endless violence, we are 
tired of being afraid and we 
are tired of the empty thoughts 
and prayers offered after every 
shooting. 
While I had always been a 
major supporter of gun control, 
it was the shooting in Dayton, 
Ohio, this summer that pushed 
me to support a mandatory 
buyback 
on 
semi-automatic 
assault weapons. Due to the 
heroism of a police officer, 
that shooting lasted only 32 
seconds. However, in those 32 
seconds, the shooter was still 
able to kill nine people. The 
idea that any weapon can fire 
enough bullets in 30 seconds to 
end nine innocent lives proves 
why we should not have these 
weapons of war on our streets. 
I am also personally in favor 
of restricting semi-automatic 

handguns, which can also fire 
an obscene number of bullets in 
a short amount of time. 
Unfortunately, 
beliefs 
do 
not always align with political 
pragmatism. 
Though 
most 
Democrats 
and 
I 
support 
a 
mandatory 
full 
buyback 
of 
semi-automatic 
assault 
weapons, this is not feasible 
in this political climate. Even 
worse, I believe that the calls 
for a mandatory gun buyback 
program 
play 
directly 
into 
the hands of the Republican 
Party and the National Rifle 
Association.

The GOP and the gun lobby 
love 
to 
warn 
people 
that 
Democrats 
are 
coming 
for 
their guns and, by extension, 
their liberty. In reality, the 
Democrats are simply in favor of 
common-sense gun regulations 
that help ensure the safety 
of all Americans. Even if this 
mandatory 
buyback 
program 
were to be implemented, it 
would only apply to certain semi-
automatic assault weapons.
The specifics of the proposed 
policy have been overshadowed 
by media coverage of each 
candidates’ proposed mandatory 
gun buybacks. This coverage is 
mostly centered on O’Rourke, 
who has made gun control a 
main tenet of his campaign. 
When 
asked 
about 
his 
suggested 
mandatory 
gun 
buyback 
program, 
O’Rourke 
proudly 
proclaimed, 
“Hell 
yes, we’re going to take your 
AR-15, your AK-47.” This line 
has become a rallying cry of his 
campaign, even appearing on 
campaign merchandise. 

While this line may elicit 
cheers from those on the left, 
it only serves to further the 
political divide on the issue 
of guns. Instead of explaining 
the merits of a mandatory gun 
buyback program or citing the 
success that Australia had in 
curbing violence following their 
mandatory buyback, O’Rourke is 
instead simply providing fodder 
for the GOP. 
Democrats should instead 
be focused on highlighting 
the many common-sense gun 
measures 
that 
their 
party 
stands for, including red flag 
laws, 
expanded 
background 
checks and efforts to keep guns 
out of the hands of domestic 
abusers. 
These policies are much 
more 
popular 
than 
the 
mandatory buyback program. 
According to a September 2019 
poll, 83 percent of Americans 
support background checks for 
gun purchases at gun shows or 
other private sales. This has far 
more support than a mandatory 
gun buyback program, which 
an NPR and PBS NewsHour’s 
poll showed was only supported 
by 70 percent of Democrats. 
But for Independents, only 40 
percent supported it, and for 
Republicans, it was only 23 
percent.
I admire O’Rourke for his 
tenacity on this issue and for 
taking this stand. However, 
right now Democrats must 
focus on doing all they can to 
win back not only the White 
House, but also the Senate. No 
legislation on guns is likely to 
be passed if President Donald 
Trump is reelected for a second 
term or if Republicans hold the 
Senate. That is why candidates 
should focus on the parts of 
gun control that have a greater 
consensus. And if candidates 
want to speak in favor of 
a 
mandatory 
gun 
buyback 
program, they should watch 
their words carefully and use 
their platform to emphasize 
the positives of such programs 
and not play into the hands of 
Republicans.

Immigration policy is not solely Trump’s fault
O

n 
Oct. 
2, 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
administration 
set 
plans 
to 
conduct 
a 
mass 
collection of DNA samples from 
migrants taken into custody. 
The implications of this policy 
could be massive: Hundreds of 
thousands of migrants would 
have their DNA stored into a 
national FBI database. 
At 
the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security, 
senior 
officials stated that this move 
would 
grant 
immigration 
officials 
and 
officers 
the 
jurisdiction 
to 
collect 
the 
DNA from anyone held within 
border detention facilities. At 
any given time, roughly 40,000 
migrants are held within those 
facilities. 
Some 
contend 
that 
this 
measure is not severe since 
a similar program already 
exists at the border. Operation 
Double Helix is an active 
protocol being practiced to 
help border agents determine 
genetic links between parents 
and their children in hopes 
to identify child trafficking 
operations. 
However, 
what 
makes this new policy a truly 
abhorrent unethical wreck is 
its scope.
A basic American principle 
of justice suggests a policy 
of probable cause. At least in 
the case of Operation Double 
Helix, the basis of that protocol 
is to ultimately deter crimes 
particularly pertaining to human 
trafficking. However, this new 
program would give authorities 
the absolute power to invade the 
privacy of migrants regardless of 
probable cause. The fact that any 
person would think to implement 
such a policy is antithetical to 
common American values and it 
is shameful to make one’s own 
privacy the cost for entry.

Of the few supporters of 
this policy, some attempt to 
rationalize it by reminding 
us that illegal immigration 
is a crime. However, then 
the logical conclusion would 
be 
that 
not 
only 
illegal 
immigration – but also every 
first-time 
misdemeanor 
– 
should also be eligible for DNA 
collection by the FBI. Got your 
second minor in possession 
in Michigan? Eligible. Drank 
a little too much in public? 
Eligible. Got some marijuana? 
Eligible. 
With that disgusting and 
asinine 
logic, 
the 
bar 
for 
officials to violate one’s privacy 
is a low one, making it even 
more insulting to suggest that 
a first-time misdemeanor like 
migrating across the border 
would be suitable grounds for 
officials to funnel DNA into a 
comprehensive national FBI 
database. 
The administration’s move 
to pursue this type of policy 
reveals that Trump will go to 
extreme lengths to desperately 
“fulfill” his campaign promise 
to be hard on immigration. 
Instead of a “glorious” wall 
expanding 
along 
the 
U.S.-
Mexico border, Trump has 
opted to create a genetic barrier 
with a eugenic air. 
Though this may seem like 
an abuse of executive power, 
it’s not. One could only argue 
that 
Trump’s 
policies 
are 
grossly unethical. And that’s 
the 
most 
troubling 
part. 
Legally, 
Trump 
potentially 
has the grounds to enact 
this 
policy 
without 
any 
constitutional 
pushback. 
Under the DNA Fingerprint 
Act of 2005, Trump would 
have 
the 
executive 
power 
as president to implement 
his initiative because it falls 

within 
the 
legally 
broad

That’s the reality of the entire 
immigration border crisis: Not 
all of this is Trump’s doing. 
True, people can argue that 
Trump handles immigration 
with an uncontained racist 
fervor to feed his base, but 
what people cannot deny is 
that immigration has been 
in 
constant 
humanitarian 
and ethical crisis for decades 
regardless of who is president. 
The detention centers at the 
border existed during Barack 
Obama’s 
presidency 
with 
undeniably terrible conditions. 
Obama deported more people 
than Trump. U.S. Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement, 
commonly 
known 
as 
ICE, 
was founded under the Bush 
Administration in 2003.
Immigration is a problem 
that 
predated 
Trump. 
Ultimately, 
most 
of 
the 
problems related to presidents 
and 
their 
immigration 
policies can be rooted in law. 
Immigration laws have been 
designed to be so broad in 
purpose that the executive 
branch can use these laws and 
powers with impunity.
Due to loose and poorly 
developed laws, Congress has 
allowed immigration to be 
melded by the whims of the 
president. Instead of actually 
developing 
a 
basic 
moral 
standard 
for 
immigrants, 
partisans have decided that 
their views are the only correct 
ways to see the immigration 
crisis. And this failure to 
confidently amend the issues 
at the border will continue to 
cost immigrants their liberty, 
privacy and humanity. 

A

lmost every time I ask 
someone 
how 
they 
are doing during this 
gloomy, midterm-filled week, 
they respond with “tired.” This 
response bothers me because 
it is hard to respond to and is 
sometimes said to prove how 
hard people are working. I am 
sympathetic because hard work 
has become a tool not only for 
individuals to satisfy their own 
guilt and anxieties, but also 
because it is a prerequisite for 
high social status in the pseudo-
meritocracy 
we 
are 
being 
groomed to join. However, blame 
for this toxic culture does not fall 
onto the individuals that feed 
it. Rather, it is the fault of the 
narratives of meritocracy and 
equal opportunity that serve to 
reinforce social hierarchies. 
This type of anti-overwork 
thinking is in right now. One of the 
most anticipated social science 
books this year was Daniel 
Markovits’ “The Meritocracy 
Trap.” In it, Markovits argues 
the illusion of contemporary 
meritocracy makes the extreme 
levels of inequality and societal 
hierarchies 
we 
experience 
today 
more 
sustainable. 
He 
points out that this meritocratic 
justification is fundamentally 
different than the arguments 
used to sustain inequality in the 
past. In the 1800s, the wealthy 
worked far less than the poor; it 
was obvious that social status was 
undeserved. The rich were true 
capitalists, just sitting on their 
slowly growing wealth and land. 
However, this blatant inequity 
made 
anti-elitist 
movements 
easy to get behind. Today, the 
landscape has shifted. Instead 
of physical capital to solidify 
their social status, the wealthy 
now have human capital, and 
importantly, the ability to work 
longer hours. Leisure used to be 
a sign of privilege and esteem, 
but it is now looked down upon 
as lazy. The wealthy work as 
much as they want to, while 
the poor struggle to find work. 
This system creates the illusion 
that the wealthy deserve their 
elevated social standing because 
they 
work 
hard, 
protecting 
themselves from criticism. 
Though the arguments made 
to justify social hierarchy have 
changed 
dramatically, 
the 
people making the arguments 
have stayed the same, revealing 
that the difference between 
the two is actually quite small. 
Not 
only 
does 
the 
United 

States’ enormous wealth gap 
obliterate 
the 
possibility 
of 
equal opportunity before birth, 
but research shows that there is 
a strong relationship between 
parent and child income. 
Meritocracy 
has 
been 
co-opted by inherited wealth to 
sustain itself, creating a more 
sustainable version of gross 
inequality while attacking class 
consciousness. One example is 
the arguments often made by 
the white-working class against 
affirmative action. According 
to “The Hidden Injuries of 
Class,” a famous sociological 
study, the white-working class 
often say there is enough equal 
opportunity in the United States 
such that everyone should be able 
to support themselves without 
assistance. But this viewpoint 
supports the inequality and 
social hierarchies that have 
themselves 
decimated 
rural 
populations by implicitly saying 
that they do not deserve the 
opportunities they do not have. 
Even efforts to attack the 
meritocracy subtly sustain it. 
For example, effective altruism 
— a philosophy which advocates 
for the rich to give all their 
money beyond what they need 
to survive to the most needy — 
attacks the meritocracy by saying 
that individuals should give their 
money away to those who need it 
more. Implicit in this ideology is 
that people with money do not 
necessarily deserve their money 
or are obligated to give it away. 
But this philosophy sneakily 
supports the idea that individuals 
are the best decision-makers for 
their money and fails to bring 
about systemic changes in the 
way wealth is distributed beyond 
individual 
altruism. 
Another 
example 
is 
the 
revitalized 
academic focus on working less. 
While externally these efforts 
attack the meritocracy, most of 
these writers (myself included) 
are white men, implying that our 
efforts may just be the facade for 
white economic anxiety over a 
diversifying America and the 
#MeToo era. 
Markovits 
acknowledges 
that one interpretation of his 
argument is that elites should 
not have to work as hard as they 
do to attain their social status. 
While Markovits does not ask 
readers to sympathize with the 
rich, he argues that the rich too 
are hurt by the meritocracy, 
which means that there is an 
opportunity for it to change. 

But even if the rich suffer from 
overwork, they are actually 
benefiting from the meritocracy 
because 
it 
legitimizes 
their 
social status. 
I should perhaps not be 
writing this because I fall 
victim to these same trends. 
I 
consistently 
overschedule 
myself, I am in more than three 
active Slack channels and I feel 
the need to take as many credits 
as I can — even this article was 
finished days after the original 
due date. But I find that though I 
have thought about these issues 
for a long time and believe we 
should be doing less, I cannot 
bring myself to actually do it. 
I think it is because overwork 
is a collective action problem. 
It is hard for any one person to 
unilaterally work less within a 
culture that glorifies work like 
we do. And yet, it is also true that 
some people do not perform their 
work and need to be pushing 
themselves as much as possible 
for any myriad of reasons. It 
comes from a remarkable place 
of privilege to be able to work 
or not work as much as I want 
to based on my philosophical 
inclinations. 
And yet, I feel compelled to 
write about this because I and 
those whom I love are victims to 
this culture on a smaller scale. 
We conceive our value based on 
the systems in which we exist 
— grades, scholarships, whether 
we get the next leadership 
position — but so often these 
systems are false meritocracies.
The psychology seems similar 
to the way Americans think 
about school systems. When 
parents are polled on perceived 
quality of American schools, 
they 
consistently 
think 
the 
education system is terrible, 
but their children’s schools are 
great. 
That is similarly true for 
illusions 
of 
meritocracy. 
Americans 
are 
increasingly 
worried about inequality of 
opportunity on a country-scale, 
yet we continue to believe in our 
local institutions and systems. 
The two cannot both be true, so 
we should apply our scrutiny of 
false meritocracies consistently. 
We should tone down our 
high-level criticism over larger 
issues of false meritocracy, and 
recommit to identifying those 
right around us.

Blankenburg embracing physicality despite size

Last January, when Penn 
State came to Ann Arbor, then-
freshman 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg was on the ice for 
his first shift just under five 
minutes into the game. Within 
moments of taking the ice, he 
laid a hit that Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson can’t forget.
Forward Liam Folkes came 
up through the neutral zone 
and lost the puck as he crossed 
center ice. Just as Folkes 
turned to look for the puck, 
Blankenburg stepped into a hip 
check that sent all 182 pounds 
of Folkes flying across the ice 
— knocking off his helmet and 
one of his gloves.
Blankenburg, 
meanwhile, 
calmly stood up and rejoined 
the play. The hit set the tone 
for what eventually became a 
Michigan 5-1 win, and made 
it clear to everyone in the 
building 
that 
Blankenburg 
was unafraid to play physical 
hockey.
When 
asked 
about 
Blankenburg’s physical play on 
Wednesday, Pearson brought 
up the hit from last year’s 
game against the Nittany Lions 
without prompting.
“He’s 
got 
a 
little 
nasty 
streak to him,” 
Pearson said. “I 
still 
remember 
the 
hit 
last 
year where he 
popped 
the 
Liam 
Folkes 
kid from Penn 
State on a real 
good 
hit. 
But 
he’s 
a 
bundle 
of energy and a bundle of grit. 
You’d like about 10 to 12 guys 
like him on your team.”
At 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds, 
Blankenburg is the Wolverines’ 
smallest defenseman by two 
inches and about 15 pounds 
— but he doesn’t play like 
it. In nearly every game, he 

finds himself at the center of 
chippy moments or involved in 
skirmishes with the other team. 
And sometimes, Blankenburg 
will hit a player hard enough 
that looks like it came from a 
player twice his size.
Blankenburg 
credits 
the 
foundation of his scrappiness 
to growing up 
with his brother 
Alex, 
who 
is 
three 
years 
older than him. 
It’s a cliché that 
older 
brothers 
play rough on 
their 
younger 
brothers, but it 
was reality for 
Blankenburg as 
a child.
“Whether 
playing 
mini 
sticks in the basement or 
just playing basketball in the 
driveway, he would always 
make sure I wasn’t … soft,” 
Blankenburg said. “He would 
always make sure that I’m 
tough, so I guess you could 
say I get that from him, and 

especially my dad, too.”
His penchant for physical 
play has sent Blankenburg to the 
penalty box a few more times in 
his career that Pearson would 
prefer, but Pearson is clear 
that he’d rather have a player 
that goes too far at times than 
one that he has to constantly 
encourage 
to 
play with an 
edge.
Blankenburg 
certainly 
has 
an edge, and 
now is tasked 
with 
finding 
a 
balance 
between 
playing 
tough 
and staying out 
of the penalty 
box. Last year, he took just 
six penalties in 36 games, but 
Pearson would like to see him 
find even more control of his 
emotions.
“For the most part, yes (he’s 
composed),” 
Pearson 
said. 
“Every once in a while, he’ll 
just go off the deep end and 

you’re wondering where his 
brain went. … That’s where you 
have to have emotional control, 
and it’s hard, because of guys 
like that who play so hard. It 
can be difficult, especially 
when it gets physical and he’s 
trying to play physical, too. We 
just have to remind him that 
we need him on 
the ice, not in the 
box.”
This weekend, 
the 
Wolverines 
host 
Lake 
Superior 
State, 
a 
team 
that’s 
known 
for 
playing a very 
physical 
style 
of 
hockey. 
It’s 
exactly the kind 
of game Blankenburg likes, and 
it presents a test of his work on 
maintaining his composure.
“Guys are going to try to 
get under your skin, and that’s 
really the point of the game,” 
Blankenburg said. “I think 
you’ve just gotta keep your 
composure and just play hard.”

Michigan finishes 10th 
at Crooked Stick Invite

 Fifty-four holes in two days 
is far from an easy trip on the 
green, no matter how skilled 
the 
golfer, 
and 
first-year 
Michigan coach Zach Barlow 
knew that his team would need 
to dig deep in order to find 
success at the Crooked Stick 
Tournament in Carmel, Ind. 
With weather against them 
and a tough field to go up 
against — No. 13 Georgia and 
No. 5 Vanderbilt 
to name a few — 
the 
Wolverines 
started the first 
day of play with 
a 306 through 18 
holes.
“It’s 
always 
tough to stay in 
it when you have 
a 
rough 
start,” 
Barlow said. 
With Michigan 
in 13th place and 11 of the other 
14 teams in the field all scoring 
under 300 after the first 18 
holes, it was a challenge for the 
Wolverines to claw back in the 
second round. 
Junior Charlie Pilon did just 
that. After shooting a 75 for 
3-over par in the first round, 
Pilon reeled in a 71 for 1-under 
par to close out the 36-hole 
day. His three birdies on the 
5th, 9th and 12th holes helped 
him lead the Wolverines up 
one spot to 12 at the end of the 
first day. 
Sophomore Ben Dunn had a 
solid first day as well, tallying 
a 76 for 4-over par on both of 
his rounds. At the end of the 
first day, and through 36 of 
54 holes, Michigan sat in 12th 
place.
 
“A 
two-round 
day 
is 
mentally 
demanding 
and 
physically demanding,” Barlow 
said. “We need to learn how to 
just focus on the present. We 

need good stretches of golf to 
be longer and bad stretches of 
golf to be shorter.” 
The third round started off 
delayed one hour due to frost 
on the course. With winds 
a problem just like the day 
before, the Wolverines had a 
lot to deal with if they wanted 
to make it back to Ann Arbor 
with a successful tournament.
Senior Brent Ito had a late 
surge on the back nine with 
two back-to-back birdies on 
the 11th and 12th holes and 
another 
on 
the 17th to 
give 
him 
a 
73 for 1-over 
par 
on 
the 
day. 
This, 
combined 
with a solid 
third 
round 
performance 
from 
junior 
Henry Spring 
— 
 
75 
for 
3-over par — put Michigan 
at 10th place to end their 
tournament. 
Pilon led all golfers with a 
combined 223 for 7-over par 
after 54 holes. Freshman Pier 
Francesco de Col performed 
well too, shooting a 76 for 
4-over par in his first round, 
second on the team at the 
end of that round, and also 
knocking in two back-to-back 
birdies to start off the third 
round. 
“We have a ways to go,” 
Barlow said. “Our short game 
needs to get better, it is your 
insurance policy.”
Even 
though 
the 
short 
game didn’t impress, Barlow 
attested a bright spot from the 
tournament, Pilon’s comeback 
second round, to his assistant 
coach Matt Hoffman. 
“Matt walked with him for 
a couple holes,” Barlow said. 
“(They both) got in a good 
rhythm.”

Wolverines shut out Ball State, 6-0

Wherever the Wolverines 
go, their parents follow. A 
weekend in enemy territory 
was 
no 
exception, 
as 
the 
Michigan field hockey team 
earned 
two 
victories 
at 
Buckeye Turf Field, including 
an overtime victory over Ohio 
State. 
Michigan’s 
positive 
momentum 
and 
parental 
fandom earned the Wolverines 
an 
even 
playing 
field 
in 
Columbus on Sunday against 
Ball State.
“No matter where we play, we 
have an unbelievable amount of 
support from our parents,” said 
redshirt sophomore midfielder 
Emma Tamer. “Even if we are 
in California playing Stanford, 
we still have a good amount of 
our fans and it kind of always 
feels a little neutral to me.”
No. 11 Michigan’s (10-3) 
unwavering support paid off in 
its 6-0 shutout victory over the 
Cardinals (3-10).
With under a minute to 
play 
in 
the 
first 
quarter, 
redshirt sophomore forward 
Kate Burney threaded a pass 
to sophomore forward Katie 
Anderson, who found the back 
of the cage at the 14:04 mark. 
After a scoreless second 

quarter, the Wolverines started 
the second half with three 
shots in the first 65 seconds 
en route to 14 total in the third 
quarter. 
“The biggest change came 
at halftime. I think we kind 
of woke up a little bit,” Tamer 
said. “We all know the tactics 
are 
there. 
It’s 
about 
the 
intangibles. It’s about whether 
we show up and work hard and 
whether you’re on your girl 
or you’re one step off. I think 
those are minor details that 
make a huge difference.”
Michigan’s 
third 
quarter 
surge led to another late-
quarter goal, this time from 
Tamer, 
assisted 
by 
senior 
midfielder Meg Dowthwaite, 
pushing the lead to 2-0.
“We’re always trying to play 
sixty minutes no matter if it’s 
the first minute or the last 
minute,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We’re a 
very fit team and I think they 
can manage doing that.”
Going 
into 
the 
fourth 
quarter, Ball State had not 
registered a single shot since 
the first half. The Wolverines’ 
smothering defense ensured 
that didn’t change in the final 
15 minutes.
“It all starts with a great 
defense,” 
Pankratz 
said. 
“We’ve had a bunch of shutouts 

in a row and I think our 
backfield players were really 
clamping down defensively.”
Yet 
it 
was 
Michigan’s 
dynamic offense that stole the 
show in the fourth.
Dowthwaite 
got 
things 
started, scoring off an assist 
from 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Sophia Southam. The final 
three minutes of the contest 
included goals from sophomore 
midfielder Kathryn Peterson at 
57:02, junior midfielder Maya 
Gompper at 58:08 and Tamer 
less than a minute later— her 
second of the afternoon. 
After narrowly winning the 
shots battle, 3-2, in the first 
quarter, Michigan dominated, 
28-3, the rest of the way. The 
Wolverines’ 
aggressiveness 
on the offensive end was 
paramount in their fourth-
quarter scoring outburst.
“No shot is a bad shot,” 
Tamer said. “We have amazing 
forwards who have their sticks 
down and can finish. We know 
that it’s a process and not every 
shot is going to go in, even 
though we strive for that. 
“I think it’s just trusting 
the process and knowing that 
eventually those goals will 
come if we continuously work 
hard.”
Sunday, that hard work paid 
dividends.

‘M’ offense sputters in 1-0 loss

As graduate transfer forward 
Nebojsa 
Popovic 
re-entered 
the scoreless match in the 66th 
minute, hope abounded that 
the team’s leading goal-scorer 
could spark a stagnant Michigan 
attack.
Just a minute later, a goal 
was scored — only it was 
Indiana breaking the ice, not the 
Wolverines.
Hoosiers midfielder Spencer 
Glass tip-toed his way past the 
Michigan defense down the left 
flank before blasting a near-
post goal over the head of senior 
goalkeeper Andrew Verdi. The 
goal proved to be the difference 
in what was a 1-0 loss for the 
Wolverines (6-3-3 overall, 2-1-2 
Big Ten) against No. 4 Indiana 
(8-1-3, 4-0-0) on Sunday in 
Bloomington.

“We take advantage of our 
opportunities, and we have 
them,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “They took one 
of theirs, and we were not 
fortunate enough to have one of 
ours.”
In 
the 
game’s 
waning 
moments, 
Michigan 
created 
one last chance in an attempt to 
notch the elusive goal. A right-
side corner resulted in a frenetic 
game of pinball in the box, the 
ball bouncing off two Wolverine 

heads before landing at the 
feet of junior defenseman Joel 
Harrison. Harrison unleashed a 
strong bottom-center shot, only 
for it to wind up in the hands of 
conveniently-positioned Indiana 
goalkeeper Roman Celetano. 
Michigan’s defense continued 
to serve as an anchor, limiting a 
potent Hoosier attack to just one 
goal. Junior midfielders Marc 
Ybarra and Carlos Tellez in 
particular helped set the game’s 
aggressive tone from the onset. 
“That’s 
a 
confident 
group,” 
Daley 
said. “You know, 
they 
haven’t 
conceded 
more 
than one goal 
since game one. 
So that’s a six-
week 
period 
where 
they’re 
not accustomed 
to 
conceding 
goals. Defense is a big team 
effort, back to front.”
The Wolverines especially 
embodied the definition of team 
defense in the 16th minute, 
when Verdi strayed far out of 
his net chasing a tailing cross 
from the left side. Though the 
ball found its way to an Indiana 
forward before Verdi could 
get it, junior defender Jackson 
Ragen intervened to protect 
the goal, denying the threat by 

stepping in front and absorbing 
the shot with his body. 
Verdi’s play in the net also 
offered the defense a firm 
backbone — recording four saves 
in the match. 
“That’s what we ask out 
of our goalies, to give us an 
opportunity to win the game,” 
Daley said. “And he did that with 
a good performance.”
Noticeably 
absent 
in 
the 
Michigan attack was senior 
forward Jack Hallahan, who 
missed 
the 
contest 
due 
to 
injury. 
Still, 
without 
Hallahan, 
the 
Wolverines were 
able to generate 
opportunities 
with 
nine 
shots 
and 
three 
corners. 
Despite the loss, 
competing with 
the perennial Big Ten favorite 
in Indiana offers reason for 
optimism. 
“The group believes that we 
can play toe-to-toe with anyone 
in the country, even with a bit 
of a depleted squad,” Daley said. 
“So if we can get ourselves with 
other guys that are coming back 
full circle, that will be helpful. 
Within the group, the belief that 
we can do this against a tough 
team is there.”

Ed Warinner hoping Michigan has 
found its identity in the run game

Monday 
afternoon, 
when 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
was asked whether he likes the 
progress from the run game, 
he offered up only one word 
before pausing for further 
contemplation.
“Yes.”
And so far through six games 
of the Josh Gattis era, the 
numbers back him up. Since 
averaging a miserable 2.1 yards 
per carry against Wisconsin, 
the Wolverines have managed 
at least 3.4 in every game since. 
Not lighting the world on fire, 
but progress.
On 
Saturday, 
Michigan 
football’s ground resurgence 
peaked in a 14-carry, 161-yard 
first quarter against Illinois. 
The 
Wolverines 
had 
five 
explosive plays (which they 
define as rushes of at least 12 
yards) on the ground in the 
first 15 minutes — more than 
their last four games combined.
“We got the outside zone 
game going with the pin-and-
pull, getting some linemen 
out on the edge, pulling our 
guards and center out there,” 
said offensive line coach Ed 
Warinner. “They did a nice job 
of that. But it was just good to 
establish the run game.”
Early in the season, teams 
were taking away that pin-
and-pull play — Michigan’s 
most-used run scheme a year 
ago, according to Warinner. 
The play requires the strong-
side tight end to seal the edge, 
allowing either a guard or 
center to pull and get to the 

second level, and opening up 
holes for potential big plays.
But 
facing 
different 
defensive 
looks 
in 
Gattis’ 
spread offense, the Wolverines 
hadn’t been able to open up 
holes on pin-and-pulls until 
Saturday.
“The difference in what you 
see defensively when you’re in 
more spread-out formations 
and when you’re in more 
condensed (is big),” Warinner 
said. “Yeah, that for sure has 
been the biggest difference for 
how you block.”
Michigan’s 
issues 
establishing the pin-and-pull 
underscore that larger point. 
It’s week eight now, and the 
Wolverines are still finding 
out which run packages work 
in Gattis’ offense.
Warinner knows that’s not 
okay. He also believes they’re 
still figuring it out.
“I just think it becomes 
clearer what you can and can’t 
do and what you’re good at 
and what you’re not good at,” 
Warinner said. “And it just, as 
that picture clears itself up, 
then you stick with that, do it 
more, build on it. So we’re all 
into doing that.”
The goal, of course, was 
to have an identity solidified 
long before entering the meat 
of their schedule — a bruising 
slate 
featuring 
marquee 
matchups against Penn State, 
Notre Dame, Michigan State 
and Ohio State in the latter 
half of the season.
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
Warinner said he evaluates 
what a team’s identity should 
be after two to three games. 

This year, its third game was 
a 21-point loss to Wisconsin, 
with just 40 rushing yards and 
a carry split in flux. Senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson, 
who ran for 273 yards a year 
ago, had a long of four yards 
that day.
Now, he has 42 yards in 
Michigan’s last two games. A 
modest total, but enough to 
get the Wolverines’ zone-read 
game working.
“That makes a defense stay 
honest,” Warinner said. “And 
when I say honest, they have to 
protect all the gaps. They can’t 
collapse extra people into the 
box and so they have to be real 
cognizant of him as a threat. 
Because he is a threat, you’ve 
seen it the last couple weeks.”
In 
front 
of 
Patterson, 
the offensive line play has 
been there — “really getting 
consistent, gelling and playing 
with a style of play that’s 
physical, smart and tough,” 
as Harbaugh puts it. The 
running backs, despite their 
inexperience, 
have 
enough 
explosiveness to get the job 
done. The key is putting it all 
together into a coherent run 
game.
“You have to establish who 
you are and what you want to 
do,” Warinner said. “And then 
you evaluate. At some point, 
you have to say, here’s what 
we’re good at.”
As 
the 
11.5 
yards 
per 
carry in the first quarter 
against Illinois showed, the 
Wolverines are getting there. 
As the 3.9 yards per carry after 
that showed, they still have a 
ways to go.

McGrone playing in Bush’s image

Cam 
McGrone 
briefly 
shuffled 
his 
feet 
as 
he 
approached 
the 
line 
of 
scrimmage, sizing up the play 
before launching. He kept his 
eyes forward, identifying the 
roll-out, 
play-action 
Illinois 
was attempting to execute. The 
redshirt freshman linebacker 
then bolted, darting toward 
Illinois 
quarterback 
Matt 
Robinson, grasping his right 
arm and holding tight.
Moments later, he jarred the 
ball loose, as the convulsion 
of Robinson’s body met the 
force of McGrone’s strength. 
The ball came free. Fifth-
year senior linebacker Jordan 
Glasgow fell on it. In doing so, 
the defense put to rest any hints 
of an upset bid on Saturday — 
and McGrone added another 
chapter to his rapidly-evolving 
breakout campaign.
“They didn’t really want 
to play with us anymore,” 
McGrone 
said 
confidently 
after the game. “I had an 
opportunity, and I had to take 
it.
“I saw the opportunity to 
make a big play. So, I had to for 
my team.”
It was the kind of play 
Michigan 
fans 
have 
come 
to expect from their MIKE 
linebacker 
in 
recent 
years. 
Devin Bush, now flirting with 
NFL stardom himself, made 
those plays at Michigan on a 
near-weekly basis, when his 
whirring 
sideline-to-sideline 
speed and uncanny instincts 
landed him among Michigan’s 
best ever. When Bush left, 
charting off to millions of 
dollars as a top-10 NFL draft 
pick, it was reasonable to 
expect a degree of drop-off at 
the position.
Cerebral linebackers with 
running 
back-speed 
don’t 
just grow on trees. Or so the 
coaching staff thought.
“(Bush) was able to cover 

up 
for 
some 
mistakes 
of 
the 
linebackers, 
but 
we’ve 
grown as a linebacker room 
as individuals,” Glasgow said 
before the season. “I feel that 
we’ll be able to cover each other. 
We might not have a top-10 pick 
in the linebacker room now, but 
that doesn’t mean that we can’t 
be as effective as linebackers, 
like, in total. 
“As everyone improves, I feel 
that we’ll be just as good as we 
were last year.”
Even 
that 
confidence, 
though, did not promise a like-
for-like replica of Bush. No 
one assumes that mantle four 
games into a career, no matter 
how impressive, but McGrone 
has shown glimpses of a similar 
skillset.
And with 2.5 sacks and 3.5 
tackles for loss, there’s reason 
to believe he’s learning how 
to translate that talent into 
on-field production.
“You can have a good idea 
of when guys are seeing it, 
because like I said, your eyes 
control the function of your 
body,” said linebackers coach 
Anthony 
Campanile. 
“They 
tell your feet what to do. When 
guys’ feet start playing fast, you 
got a pretty good idea as a coach 
that this guy is taking a step 
and he’s kinda entering another 
level.
“I think the reps he got, even 

in the Wisconsin game, were 
invaluable to him. Any work 
you get as a young guy, in terms 
of developing confidence, it’s 
huge. He’s done a great job with 
it, he’s taken a step each week. 
From camp on, I think he’s just 
gotten progressively better and 
better, incrementally.”
What Campanile describes — 
a kind of measured, incremental 
rise — might well be true. But 
what’s been on display on the 
field for McGrone has been 
meteoric.
Mere weeks ago, he was 
comfortably 
second 
on 
the depth chart at MIKE 
linebacker, with Josh Ross the 
heir apparent to Bush’s throne. 
Ross, in fairness, had filled 
in admirably before he was 
sidelined with an undisclosed 
injury less than a month ago. 
Now there’s a real question as 
to whether Ross will reassume 
that starting spot.
“That’s a good problem to 
have,” Campanile said. “I think 
we’re back to the issue — it’s not 
an issue, it’s a great situation — 
in the summer. We had had that 
situation in the summer. ‘Hey, 
this guy we can (win) with on 
Saturday. We can win with that 
guy on Saturday. We can win 
with that guy on Saturday.’
“Never a bad thing to have a 
bunch of guys that can help you 
win on Saturday.”

Seniors leaving stamp on program

It’s hard to replace 1,000 
points, a two-year starter and 
“Miss Hustle.” It’s even harder 
to replace 2,000 points, a four-
year starter and the pacemaker 
of your team. Nicole Munger 
and Hallie Thome were the 
heart of the Michigan women’s 
basketball team, on the court 
and off it. They graduated last 
year – leaving the Wolverines 
needing a transplant.
But where some teams have 
trouble finding new leaders, 
there was no sign of such 
problems in Crisler Center at 
Wednesday’s media day. Senior 
forward Kayla Robbins and 
senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
have filled the gaps and made 
the team their own.
“I 
think 
sometimes 
the 
younger kids took a kind of 
backseat,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “Kind of just 
listened to (Thome) said this or 
(Munger) said this, we’re just 
going to follow what they say 
because they know best. Now, 
I feel like, the team really feels 
like, each individual person can 
contribute to the success of our 
team. Whether that’s from a 
basketball perspective or that’s 
from a voice.”
With the new season, Johnson 
and Robbins are each bringing 
their unique perspectives to 
the team. Neither of them have 
been regular starters for a whole 
season in their college careers 
– 
Johnson 
handicapped 
by 
injuries, Robbins coming off the 
bench. The pair nevertheless 
used their experience to reach 
out and make every member feel 
valued.
“What I’m trying to do is 
sit back and listen,” Johnson 
said. “When I was a freshman, 
I didn’t really have a voice 
because I didn’t think I could 
speak up. I didn’t think there 
was a place for me to speak up. 
But I always make sure that this 
year, everything is a debate.”
The two seniors are taking 
the mantle of what is probably 
the most talented Wolverine 
team under Barnes Arico. The 
coach’s 12th-ranked recruiting 

class from last season now has 
a year of experience under its 
belt. Three players have played 
internationally, and Michigan 
is coming off two straight trips 
to the NCAA Tournament after 
going five without a ticket to the 
dance.
The expectations are higher; 
the next steps are steeper. To 
climb them, the Wolverines 
need to grow over the course 
of the season by having leaders 
empower 
players 
who 
may not make 
an 
immediate 
impact.
“(Johnson 
and 
Robbins) 
opened (it) up 
so 
everyone 
feels like they 
have a voice,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“Now 
when you come in there’s just an 
energy of everybody’s looking 
around, everybody’s ready to go. 
And that’s something different 
we haven’t had and I think that’s 
something the kids really like as 
they all feel they can contribute 
to our success.”
Added 
freshman 
guard 
Michelle Sidor: “If they see 
you getting down on yourself, 
if I’m having a bad practice or 
something, they’re definitely 
there to, especially (Johnson), 
to lift you up and be like ‘It’s 
alright, you got the next play, 
keep your head up.’ I think that’s 
huge.”
For Johnson and Robbins, 

though, building a team goes 
beyond 
the 
court. 
When 
freshman center Izabel Varejão 
arrived at her dorm, without 
her family, the team made time 
for her. They welcomed and 
supported her, grabbing dinner 
and ice cream to make her feel 
at home.
“They’ve done a really good 
job of helping us with anything,” 
said freshman guard Maddie 
Nolan. “Not even basketball-

wise, 
if 
we 
needed 
advice 
about 
school 
or stuff around 
campus 
they’ve 
done 
a 
really 
good 
job 
of 
integrating 
us 
into a team.”
Added 
Robbins: 
“Me 
and 
(Johnson), 
we’ve 
had 
a 
different journey than everyone 
on the team and we’ve been the 
freshmen who came in and don’t 
really know what to say or what 
to do so we really just opened 
it up for the team. If somebody 
has a problem or somebody has a 
suggestion, they can always just 
bring it up. It’s never an issue.”
Johnson 
and 
Robbins 
probably 
won’t 
end 
up 
as 
Michigan’s 
leading 
scorers. 
They may not be the type of 
players that dominate a game, 
but they’re already making 
their mark on the team before 
the season has even started: 
a culture that prides itself on 
inclusivity.

Climate change is real and it’s happening now. From fossil 
fuel emissions and greenhouse gases, to the growing ecological 
footprints of individuals all across the country, our earth is in a 
state of crisis. These are only a few layers to the broader crisis 
we are facing while simultaneously waiting for government 
officials to implement some form of policy to change this broken 
system. As the 2020 election moves closer each day, individuals 
and candidates are doing everything in their power to draw 
attention to this issue. Artists are no exception.
The climate crisis is abstract and intimidating. It can be 
confusing to understand exactly what it entails when the 
effects of climate change are sometimes hidden, or have been 
entrenched in our societal norms for so long, we forgot they 
were even there. As activists and community members alike are 
taking to the streets, urging for change, so are artists. Their work 
serves as an integral visual reminder of what is at stake, and in 
many cases, bridges the gap between different communities, 
identities and locations across the country. Artist and activist 
Ellen Rutt and activist Joseph Trumpey, a University professor, 
are on the frontlines of this movement in Michigan, working 
alongside their communities in Detroit and Ann Arbor to raise 
awareness about this crisis, unifying individuals of all identities 
and reminding us that in this fight, we are all connected and 
must urge for policy change together. 
Detroit based artist Ellen Ruttis often known first for her 
massive, abstract murals. With murals located in Grand Rapids, 
Ann Arbor, Detroit and beyond, Rutt explains how her role as a 
muralist came to be and how it has guided her path into other, 
more environmentally driven projects. 
“I definitely think that murals are how I branded myself. And 
now, I’m shifting away from that, or shifting into more political 
murals or saying no to murals that don’t align with the projects 
that I really think are important,” Rutt said in an interview 
with The Daily at her studio in Detroit. Rutt’s work consists of 
colorful, abstract paintings of all sizes — her murals being the 
largest — and are often for clients. Rutt mentions her murals as 
the more traditional side of her practice, a way 
to sustain herself and her studio. 
“Do I always want to do commercial 
murals? What are the conversations I want 
to have? Moving forward … it’s figuring out 
how to do (murals) with as much integrity as 
possible,” Rutt said. With murals as her tool 
for supporting her more contextual collections 
of paintings, Rutt has always been an advocate 
for the environment, a theme that has driven 
her most recent collection of paintings.
“(The environment) was definitely always 
part of my life … it was just after the IPCC 
report came out at the end of 2018 that I think 
kicked every part of me into gear because 
it put a very tangible time frame (on) the 
number — we have 12 years. It felt like all of 
a sudden all of these things that were sort of 
ambiguously in the future had a timeline. It 
was at that moment that everything inside of 
me switched,” Rutt said.
This 
environmental 
influence 
shows 
through in Rutt’s most recent collection of 
paintings titled “This Must be the Place.” Each 
painting includes found textures existing in 
conversation with Rutt’s well known, bright, 
abstract shapes. 
“I haven’t always done this, but I would go 
outside and do rubbings and gather textures 
and find various ways to use the landscape for 
the backdrop of my paintings. That shows up 
in a number of ways, from very linear to more 
abstract and loose,” Rutt said. She explained 
that bringing these textures into other spaces 
creates a very specific experience, one viewers 
can exist within. Rutt described how this 
process was formed from her experience with murals. As she 
created each part of the collection, she asked questions about 
the way that spaces create experiences and how our culture can 
interact with the spaces depicted in her paintings. It is these 
questions that build the visuals and theme of “This Must be the 
Place,” a collection created in direct response to the climate 
crisis. 
“These (paintings) were my way of gathering evidence and 
capturing aspects of places that may not always be around or that 
will inevitably change. I think there is also something deeply 
intimate about not just looking at something and drawing, but 
setting (the canvas) on the wall and really physically being on 
the ground or in a space. That also really reconnected me with 
my commitment to what it means to participate in a conversation 
about climate change,” Rutt said. She explained that this body 
of work pulls textures from all around the world, bringing 
textures of all environments to one gallery space for audiences 
to interpret. 
“I can’t make work outside, in this way, and not say it exists 
within the context of climate change. We have to deal with that 
… now,” Rutt said. 
The textures present in “This Must be the Place” started at a 

residency Rutt completed in 
New York, and more textures 
were pulled from locations 
all across the United States 
during a road trip to Los 
Angeles. 
Rutt 
explained 
that 
while 
the 
message 
of this collection may not 
immediately emerge, it is the 
selection of these locations 
and 
the 
individuals 
she 
meets at each location that 
build their context and bring 
her closer to a fight against 
climate change. 
“In my current juncture, 
I’m not an energy expert, and 
I’m not a policy expert. What 
I do have access to are forms 
of culture. So what I’m most 
interested in at this moment, 
which will eventually evolve, 
is learning enough about 
these other (places) to funnel 
the 
information 
I 
learn 
to all the people who pay 
attention to my work, and 
also connect with people who are on the front lines, who are 
people of color, who are marginalized communities to also say, 
‘Where are you needing the most support, how can we envision 
this just transition, how can I be an ally?’” With this notion, Rutt 
explained her personal and artistic ties to how this body of work 
especially impacts policy and climate reform.
“I don’t know that my particular work will inspire policymakers 
to act differently. I think it’s the way that (these paintings) are 
made and the reason for them being born. It’s all the auxiliary 
things outside of the paintings which is starting to ask, where 
should I do the place paintings, and why do them there? Who do 
I meet while I’m there? The more people talk about it, the more 
it just becomes known and will ultimately elevate the activism 

to a degree where I hope policy makers are like, ‘Wow, this is 
serious,’” Rutt said. 
Rutt’s work invites us to understand that we are all connected 
to the spaces we inhabit. Rutt argues that it is in these overlaps 
of our environments where viewers can see how integral it is to 
protect these spaces, as they are already changing.
“We have to first see (climate change) as a huge problem and 
see the alternatives not as something to be overwhelmed by — 
or maybe to be overwhelmed by — but to commit to anyway, 
because it actually could benefit so many people in ways that we 
can’t even imagine yet. It’s not as much an act of sacrificing as 
it is an act of liberation, making it as joyous and empowering as 
possible to change our whole view on the value system that we 
currently have,” Rutt said. 
A parallel to Ellen Rutt’s environmentally driven abstract 
paintings and murals is Professor Joseph Trumpey. An educator 
at the University’s Stamps School of Art & Design and the 
School of Natural Resources & Environment, Trumpey said in 
an interview with The Daily that “making beautiful stuff to 
change the world,” is a gig for him. Similar to Rutt’s work, his 
emphasis and extensive knowledge of green building focuses on 
connection and inspiring broader communities to take action 
in the fight against climate 
change. 
“I think there’s a natural 
fit for creative work to be 
able to tell unique stories,” 
Trumpey said. “Personally I 
was an avid boy scout as a kid 
in the ’70s, so my time was 
spent learning about the Big 
Woods and how to camp and 
to do things, but it was also … 
how to clean up.” 
Trumpey 
said 
environmental 
issues 
impacted society early on, 
and now they have lasting 
effects on us today.
“For the last fifty years, 
the environment has been a 
pressing issue in the mindset 
of North Americans. Now 
we’re on the rebirth of the 
first Earth Day and we’re 
on the anniversary of the 
Cuyahoga 
River 
catching 
on fire. All of that set into 
motion a lot of activism,” 
Trumpey said. While these 
early 
forms 
of 
activism 

have shaped the action we are aiming to take today, Trumpey 
mentioned that the climate crisis is not so black and white. 
“I think it was easier to get people motivated back then 
because rivers were on fire; that’s a very dramatic thing that 
doesn’t take much paying attention to notice. People look at that 
and go, ‘Oh crap … bad news, we need to fix that right?’ And now 
it’s a lot more subtle. Look, it’s a beautiful day, but up there in 
the atmosphere, there are bad greenhouse gases,” Trumpey said. 
With this knowledge of the environment, Trumpey’s work is 
heavily centered around environmentally conscious building 
and reducing the sizes of footprints that exist within the built 
environment. A master of strawbale building, Trumpey has 
educated students in this strategy at the University’s botanical 
gardens and lives in astrawbale homethat 
he built with his wife and family. 
“We live off the grid and we do not 
purchase meat or eggs. We grow half of 
our food and we make all of our electricity. 
So once you’re paying attention in those 
sort of ways you understand that there’s 
such a thing as good pork versus bad pork, 
and there’s good electricity versus bad 
electricity.” 
Trumpey noted that while he pays 
attention to his footprint in this way, other 
larger groups of individuals (he offered the 
University population as an example) do 
not. 
“This works for me and it works for 
subsets of folks, hopefully we can get it to 
work for decision makers and policy makers 
because if you look at U-M, we can’t expect 
90,000 people to pay attention to their 
electricity this way. If we got the decision 
makers to think about it like, ‘Oh crap. 
There really is bad electricity,’ and that’s 
called the grid,” Trumpey said.
Trumpey explained that the grid is 
heavily based on fossil fuels and large 
areas of development, like the University, 
are built with this type of environmentally 
harmful 
electrical 
system. 
Strawbale 
buildings combat this, while simultaneously 
building connections among those who are 
ready to make these changes in the built 
environment. 
“You’ve got to build those relationships 
and trust to be able to do something that’s 
technically against the rules. ‘Strawbale 
buildings are technically illegal in the state of Michigan.’ So 
how do you get somebody to be able to trust you enough to do 
something illegal, and you’re not doing it in the shadows like 
to rebel? You’re doing it in full daylight to get people to pay 
attention differently,” Trumpey said. 
It is this notion that makes Trumpey’s work such a strong 
parallel to Ellen Rutt’s environmentally themed paintings. 
Both individuals are using their knowledge and depictions of 
environmental consciousness to invite a broader audience to 
learn from their techniques and urging them to follow their lead. 
Trumpey also heads an effort to build a sustainable campus 
farmfor students at the University, made entirely out of straw.
“I think that’s what the strawbale at the farm is all about. 
It’s about building a community, but it’s also about pushing the 
edge out so that people could go, ‘Oh, look, yeah, that’s cool.’ I 
understand the mission of that, it’s tangible, it’s part of a bigger 
thing. (Strawbale campus farms) gets a lot of attention and 
people are there, they’re drawn to it, because it’s beautiful and 
has texture. It was built by humans that they know, and it came 
from the land,” Trumpey said. 
Trumpey explained that this is the type of thought we need to 
approach green buildings with. He argues that we need to focus 
on the bigger picture instead of aestheticized debates that are 
currently circulating the climate crisis. 
“Efficient building is cool, it’s needed, but it won’t fix 
everything. We get distracted by the scale of things, like the 
plastic straw debate. There’s stupid stuff we get lost on. My 
house and my practice doesn’t have a significant effect on the 
footprint of Southeastern Michigan or my township because it’s 
just me and my family right now, but I think you punch outside 
your weight class, because it draws a lot of attention and makes 
people think,” Trumpey said. 
The work of both Ellen Rutt and Joseph Trumpey is unifying 
members of Ann Arbor and Detroit communities. By starting 
a conversation through abstract art and green building, Rutt 
and Trumpey are making alternatives to our broken system 
accessible to the masses. As they open these conversations 
and engage with wider audiences through their work, a wider 
understanding of the need for environmental policy reform 
becomes even more present. While this work is not directly 
building new policy, through its inclusivity and ability to spark 
conversation, the informed viewers of Rutt’s art and Trumpey’s 
buildings can come away with the realization that in order to 
make environmentally conscious decisions, we must urge for 
policy reform to make them more feasible.
“How do we change the system so that it’s not about making 
smart or ‘right’ choices, it’s so that the options available are 
significantly better? How can we stand by our morals, work to 
get better, then just commit to understanding we’re interwoven? 
Let’s fight to break apart this system of reliance on fossil fuels,” 
Rutt said.

Sixteen-year-old climate activist Greta 
Thunberg has been making big headlines with 
her environmental activism, even making 
the cover of Time Magazine. Thunberg looks 
stunning on the cover, a green and ruffled 
dress falling perfectly over her small frame, 
making her look more mature than her usual 
hoodie and jeans ensemble — somebody to be 
taken seriously. 
I was shocked to see where Time got this 
beautiful garment. The photographer, Hellen 
van Meene, simply said she found it in an 
outlet store in Copenhagen, Denmark. While 
I was not expecting Thunberg to make an 
appearance in a piece from the latest Versace 
Spring/ Summer 2020 collection — although 
the blue-green foliage accents would have 
probably had a similar earthy vibe — I had 
thought that if she were to participate in any 
sort of fashion statement, it would be a plea for 
a more sustainable fashion industry. 
Fashion is one of the largest major 
polluting industries in theworld. So why 
don’t we include fashion in the conversation 
on climate change? Perhaps because there 
does not seem to be enough research or data 
to beconvincingto some? Or perhaps because 
fashion is so personal — we literally carry it on 
our backs every single day. 
But with the rise of designers like Stella 
McCartney, the poster woman for sustainable 
fashion, and Gabriela Hearst, the first 
designer to put on a carbon neutral fashion 
show, the new and upcoming trend in fashion 
is sustainability. 
Furthermore, MUD Jeans, a Netherlands 
denim brand and certified B-corporation (a 
professional certification for sustainable for-
profits), is one of many fashion companies 
that 
dedicate 
their 
business 
model 
to 
environmental consciousness. MUD’s vision 
is impactful in consideration of how denim 
is a large part of the fashion industry. The 
production of denim is also a major polluter — 
from the growing of cotton to the dying of the 
fabric and shipping of clothing. 
“We’ve lost the true cost of a pair of jeans 
or a jacket. We don’t calculate the real cost of 
the price of a clothing item into the shops,” 
CEO of MUD Jeans Bert van Son said in an 
interview with The Daily. “We want to make 
money, but at no volatile cost to humanity or 
to the planet.”
The well-known documentary “The True 
Cost” highlights this major shift from making 
clothing on sewing machines in your own home 
to fast fashion. Fast fashion, made popular by 
stores like Zara and Forever 21, seemed like 
an intoxicating fantasy to fashion companies. 
In this increasingly connected world, where 
the speed of producing and buying products is 
becoming more important, how do we quickly 
produce clothing that is readily accessible to 
the public? 
The answer from companies like Zara was 
to exploit laborers in developing countries and 
produce clothes using unsustainable practices. 
This included using cheaper, toxic dye, 
throwing out instead of recycling water and 
buying fabric crops, such as cotton, that are 
full of pesticides. The subsequent expansion 
of the fashion industries — producing clothes 
in China, sourcing cotton from India, shipping 
finished products to the United States — has 
increased our individual carbon footprints. 
“We’ve seen all the beautiful sides of the 
fashion industry and we’ve made it into 
throwaway, one-wear, low-quality things. 
What a shame,” van Son said. 
Companies 
like 
van 
Son’s 
came 
up 
with solutions to the environmental and 
humanitarian crises made by fast fashion. His 
solution was to look at every step of making a 
pair of jeans and to improve it by finding ways 
to lower its environmental impact. 
“24 billion kilos of cotton are grown every 
year. If we would all use 40 percent recycled 
cotton, it’s fantastic for the planet,” van Son 
explained. MUD Jeans does everything from 
using post-consumer cotton in their products 
to localizing the sourcing and shipping of their 
products to Europe to decrease their carbon 
footprint.

“For every step of making jeans, we try to do 
something else. But that’s not good enough,” 
van Son explained. MUD Jeans has its 
customers actively participate in making the 
company sustainable. You can either ship an 
old pair of jeans to MUD when you buy a new 
pair from them, or lease a new pair of jeans 
for a year or so. When the latest and newest 
jean trend comes onto the scene, customers 
can ship MUD their leased pair of jeans to 
exchange for the newest style. 
However, the choice to be a more sustainable 
fashion company comes with a major trade-
off. 
“The margin we make is lower than all of 
my competitors,” van Son said. For every step, 
from recycling water used in the process of 
making fabric to using post-consumer cotton, 
the company needs to invest more money. 
This means that their clothing becomes more 
expensive and the business has to be careful 
to make sure they have enough money to pay 
their workers, rent out their office spaces and 
keep making a profit. 
For companies that want to become more 
sustainable, this can be even more difficult. 
Convincing shareholders to make changes 
in order to become more environmentally 
friendly at a financial loss is no simple task. 
So where does the final responsibility to 
sustainable fashion lie? 
“You 
need 
three 
parties. 
You 
need 
companies doing this, the consumer starting 
to get more conscious, and you also need the 
government to install rules to help companies 
like ours to be more interesting,” van Son 
explained. “We can only do this with a team 
of high motivated people that are going for the 
same cause”
There are many solutions I can offer to 
those who feel helpless in this major issues. 
Try apps such as Good on You that evaluate 
and lay out the environmental impact of 
clothing companies. 
Do research. Research what your favorite 
clothing brands are doing to minimize their 
environmental impact. 
Money speaks. Put money toward companies 
whose values align with yours. Your individual 
dollar makes a difference because others will 
see and also want to make a difference. 
Lastly, vote. Vote for representatives, 
senators, mayors, governors and presidents 
who care about changing climate change. Call 
up your local government office and ask them 
if they’ve ever considered creating policies 
to support sustainable fashion practices in 
major companies. If they haven’t, make them 
think about it and act accordingly. If it matters 
to you, it should matter to our government 
officials. 

Making a definitive case
for sustainable fashion

In 2018, indie weirdos Animal Collective 
decided to collaborate with art-science duo 
Coral Morphologic in order to celebrate the 
International Year of the Reef, an initiative to 
protect coral reefs across the globe. The result of 
the collaboration was Tangerine Reef, an audio-
visual project in which all the members of Animal 
Collective except Panda Bear made the music 
(obviously) and the members of Coral Morphologic 
created a film that attempted to make the coral 
human-like, and thus more relatable to people.
Tangerine Reef wasn’t exactly impactful, at least 
in terms of awareness raised. Animal Collective 
did not include any sort of environmental message 
in their music. Hell, I don’t think they even 
bothered to mention coral in any of the songs. 
Instead, they created background music intended 
to put focus on Coral Morphologic’s work, which 
made a successful attempt at presenting coral in a 
way that proves it is a living, functioning organism 
and not just a zany-looking mineral deposit laying 
around on the bottom of the ocean. This is all well 
and good, but, unfortunately, not much came of 
this collaboration.
The audio aspect of the collaboration far 
overshadowed the visual aspect, which was a 
shame because the work Coral Morphologic did 
was groundbreaking and beautiful, and Animal 
Collective’s work was hypnotically numbing. 
Perhaps fairly, Animal Collective received a 
majority of the press, and any mention of Coral 
Morphologic and International Year of the Reef 
was nothing more than a quick aside. What’s more, 
most individuals ended up only listening to Animal 
Collective’s contribution in full without watching 

the accompanying film. Sure, Animal Collective 
pledged to donate a portion of Tangerine Reef’s 
proceeds to coral reef conservation efforts from 
the Ocean Foundation, Project Coral and Oceana, 
but when one aspect of the project receives all the 
press (neutral to negative press at that) it’s hard to 
feel good about projects like these.
Animal Collective, despite their intentions, 
did the bare minimum to be a part of this project. 
They merely made another album, a mediocre 
one, and sent it to Coral Morphologic for them to 
figure out how to implement. With the AC name 
attached, the project was sure to get press, but 
Animal Collective’s lack of effort drove audiences 
away, many unaware of Coral Morphologic’s 
contribution. 
Had 
the 
music 
been 
more 
captivating and its subject matter more pertinent, 
perhaps Tangerine Reef would have raised some 
serious awareness, but sadly, that isn’t the case.
The project was unsuccessful, and Animal 
Collective is to blame. The bottom line is, if a 
mixed media project like this is to be successful 
and spread a message, both sides need to make 
sure they adequately work to spread that message. 
Learn from Animal Collective’s mistake; it could 
do a lot to help our planet.
If a project like this were to be done again, 
perhaps the artists should release only the joint 
collaboration, rather than the collaboration and 
each individual contribution. That way, the entire 
project has to be experienced. In the case of 
Tangerine Reef, it would have been more effective 
to release in this manner. Coral Morphologic’s 
videography and Animal Collective’s music 
would be experienced in the way the artists and 
intended, and audiences would see that reefs are 
living and functioning. And maybe, just maybe, it 
would call attention to our poor treatment of reefs 
and the need for restoration and, at the very least, 
conservation.

Mediocrity isn’t awareness

I am not an Indigenous person, nor am I First 
Nations. I acknowledge that I am writing this 
piece based solely on research and travel and do 
not represent the voices of Indigenous people 
across the world. However, I think it’s important 
that we listen to the experience and wisdom of 
Indigenous people in tackling an issue as large as 
climate change. As a nation, we have a lot to learn 
about our relationship with our surroundings. 
This past summer, I stopped by the Abbe 
Museum nestled in the middle of Bar Harbor, 
the largest town on Mount Desert Island, Maine. 
Mount Desert Island is more famously known 
for Acadia National Park, where I had spent the 
last three days hiking and exploring. Equally as 
important as national parks is the history of its 
land: Who originally inhabited this area of earth, 
and what are their stories? With this mindset, I 
stopped by the Abbe Museum on our last day in 
Bar Harbor, and a gentle, sloping cream-colored 
building with olive green trimmings welcomed 
me inside.
The Abbe Museum, a Smithsonian affiliate 
since 2013, is in collaboration with the Wabanaki, 
the 
People 
of 
the 
Dawn. 
The 
Wabanaki 
Confederacy includes the Abenaki, Maliseet, 
Micmac, Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Nations, 
all of whom have inhabited what is now known as 
Maine and Southeastern Canada for generations. 
The Wabanaki are known as the People of the 
Dawn due to their location in Turtle Island (now 
known as North America); they are the first 
people to see the sunrise over Turtle Island, and 
thus the first to see the dawn. 
Visiting the Abbe Museum made me rethink 
my environmental education thus far. I’d only 
learned about white, eurocentric environmental 
pioneers in middle and high school; names 
like Aldo Leopold, John Muir and Theodore 
Roosevelt may sound familiar to you. But what 
about Indigenous pioneers, who have lived in 
harmony with the environment for centuries to a 
much greater extent than settlers ever have? 
This is all part of a larger process of 
decolonizing 
environmental 
history 
and 
climate change, which, among other goals, 
includes understanding that Western ways 
of 
environmental 
thinking 
and 
teaching 
often overshadow perspectives of Indigenous 
people. Indigenous people around the world 
are protecting forests and their biodiversity, 

which sequesters carbon and protects natural 
resources. Indigenous people can teach us how 
to live sustainably through their agricultural 
practices, having depended on the environment 
their 
whole 
lives. 
Indigenous 
people 
are 
protesting against large oil companies and 
deforestation, recognizing that these practices 
contribute to increased worldwide greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
We can all learn from Indigenous perspectives 
on our climate crisis, and the Abbe Museum is no 
exception. The exhibit “wolankeyutomon: Take 
Care of Everything” focused on the conservation 
of sea life and emphasized the Wabanaki’s 
relationship with whales and other maritime 
creatures. The whale of Maine appears in 
Wabanaki stories as Bootup, whose back allowed 
for travel across the Western Atlantic, waters that 
are sacred to the Wabanaki. Whales have been 
poached and harpooned by humans for many 
years. Recently an equally alarming problem has 
come to light: the discovery of whales washed to 
shore with stomachs full of plastic products. 
There was a painting at the museum that 
immediately caught my eye when I stepped into 
the exhibit, and for good reason. There are very 
few ways to misinterpret the message conveyed: 
Single-use plastics are threatening our marine 
biodiversity, including whales, one of the most 
ancient species on this earth. The Ziploc bag that 
you casually toss in the trash, the plastic fork that 
is thrown away instead of reused, the plastic bag 
that you insist is more convenient than a reusable 
one: All of this contributes to the problem. 
Too often, I’ve come across the perspective 
that climate change can only be solved by 
large corporations changing their methods of 
production. Yes, a huge part of the problem lies 
with big oil and political lobbying. But another 
part lies with our flawed understanding of what 
we can do, individually and collectively, to help 
the environment. Grassroots change is hard, but 
it can spread like wildfire if you allow it to. 
Undoubtedly, Indigenous people are welcome 
to these changing habits and have a breadth of 
knowledge to contribute to our understanding 
of the environment. A small panel tucked in 
the back of the Abbe Museum allowed visitors 
to input their personal commitments to help 
the environment on an iPad with the responses 
being projected continually on a large screen 
above. There’s more to this climate crisis than 
we think and spreading information from 
different cultures and ways of life is critical to 
our relationship with this planet.

I read Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass 
Menagerie” in 10th grade English class. Ever 
since then, I’ve been a fan of his work. In 
particular, I love his concept of a “memory play,” 
the idea of a play taking place entirely in the 
mind of a character and thus being warped by 
the distortions, diminutions and exaggerations 
we all experience in our memories. Williams 
himself states at the beginning of the play that 
“the scene is memory and is therefore non-
realistic … It omits some details; others are 
exaggerated, according to the emotional value 
of the articles it touches, for memory is seated 
predominantly in the heart.”
“The Glass Menagerie” takes place in the 
mind of the main character, Tom, as he tries 
to find a suitor for his introverted sister, 
Laura, at the urging of his mother, Amanda. 
Tom eventually 
invites 
his 
friend, Jim, to 
come to their 
home to meet 
Laura. After Jim 
meets 
Laura, 
he claims that 
he 
is 
already 
engaged. 
Amanda 
angrily blames 
Tom 
for 
not 
having already 
known this. In 
the end, Tom 
leaves his sister 
and 
mother, 
determined 
to 
never 
return. 
As his memories 
of the two of 
them end, Tom 
says 
goodbye 
to his mother 
and sister and 
asks his sister 
to blow out the 
candle on the 
memory play.
Given 
how 
essential 
the 
memory-
induced distortion of narrative is to this 
play, I’ve always assumed this concept would 
carry through Williams’s other works. I’d 
assumed this, along with many other staples 
of Modernist theater, would carry through any 
Williams play being performed today.
So this past weekend, when I had the 
privilege of seeing the Roundabout Theatre’s 
new production of Tenessee Williams’s “The 
Rose Tattoo,” I assumed I would see the same 
narrative-distorting concepts come into play. 
Williams wrote “The Rose Tattoo” in 1951, 
after all, shortly after the success of “The 
Glass Menagerie” in 1944. How could he not be 
influenced by the ground-breaking success of 
this memory play concept while he worked on 
“The Rose Tattoo”?
But to my great surprise, “The Rose Tattoo” 
is a simple, if quirky, romantic comedy. It 
follows main character Serafina Delle Rosa as 
her husband passes away, her daughter grows 
up, and she learns to love again. It’s almost a 
dark comedy: Right when Serafina is ready to 
love again, she meets a man with the body of 
her husband but the head of “a clown.” As she 
grows to love him, the audience cannot help 
but note his many faults. 
My 
predisposition 
towards 
unreliable 
narrative in this play proved to be entirely 
unfounded. If anything, the narrator/point 
of view of this play is so loosely defined as 
to be entirely negligible. But because of my 
experience with “The Glass Menagerie,” I 
found myself assuming throughout the show 
that the narrative I was witnessing was not 
accurate. At one point, as Serafina’s daughter 
cuts her wrist right before she goes on a date 
with her new love, I all but assumed that 
she was about to pass away — that Serafina’s 
love for her daughter had blinded her (as 
the narrator of the play) to the reality of her 

daughter’s feelings.
As the play began to conclude, I couldn’t 
help but allow the tragic ending of “The Glass 
Menagerie” to keep me constantly on edge — 
just as Tom’s relationships to his family fall 
apart, I all but assumed that Serafina’s would 
fall apart as well. Serafina’s withdrawal from 
the world, after all, is eerily similar to both 
Laura and Amanda’s withdrawal. I couldn’t 
see how this play could end with such a simple, 
happy conclusion given the incredibly somber 
ending of “The Glass Menagerie.”
Oddly enough, this wasn’t the first time 
that my knowledge of an artist tainted my 
perception of their work. As a young composer 
back in high school, I’d been obsessed with 
Beethoven’s 
“Große 
Fuge,” 
his 
thorny, 
dissonant, (seemingly) über-avant-garde late 
work. For those unfamiliar with the piece, it’s a 
blistering 15-minute trek through Schoenberg-
esque atonality and rhythmic, harmonic and 
melodic dissonances.
As 
a 
high 
school 
composer, 
and as I began 
branching 
out 
to 
other 
Beethoven 
string quartets, 
I 
remember 
being constantly 
affected 
by 
the 
rhythmic 
and 
harmonic 
dissonances 
that I’d learned 
to expect in the 
“Große 
Fuge” 
— 
I’d 
study 
early Beethoven 
works that were 
quite dissonant 
for the classical 
era 
he 
lived 
in at the time, 
but 
would 
barely 
notice 
the 
structural 
dissonances. 
I’d 
been 
preconditioned, 
almost, 
to 
expect 
all 
of 
Beethoven’s 
music to reach the height of his quasi-Serialist 
masterpiece, and I was unphased by anything 
less dissonant.
While Beethoven’s incredible artistic output 
allows for many separate interpretations 
and listening mindsets — notice that my 
obsession with the “Große Fuge” merely 
tainted my perception of his string quartets, 
not his greater catalogue of compositions — 
Williams’s comparably slim output leaves little 
room for this. “The Rose Tattoo” is a perfectly 
good play, after all, but given Williams’s other 
famous plays, it’s frequently neglected. 
Perhaps minor, less successful artists are 
frequently affected by the fame and success 
of their magnum opuses. Perhaps the “one hit 
wonder” concept in popular music transfers to 
other genres of the performing arts.
Almost as soon as I posited this, I saw the 
inherent flaws. Unlike popular music, which 
has only recently become a topic of historical 
study, other performing artforms have years 
of scholarly study preventing this hierarchical 
abandonment from taking place — I wouldn’t 
be surprised if a scholar or two have founded 
their entire careers on the study of Williams’s 
entire catalogue, from “The Glass Menagerie” 
to “The Rose Tattoo.”
What I have learned, however, is that it can 
sometimes be just as interesting to study an 
artist’s minor works as it is to study their major 
works. In the case of Williams, for example, 
I learned far more from the discrepancies 
between this work and his other more 
popular works than I did from any of these 
successful works themselves. Perhaps our 
interests should lie not in an artist’s success 
but in their other attempts at reaching such 
success. Perhaps it is not the masterpiece but 
the almost-masterpiece, the near-masterpiece, 
that is most deserving of our critical thought.

The almost-masterpiece
that is ‘The Rose Tattoo’

In the third episode of the second season of HBO’s 
hit suburban drama “Big Little Lies,” a second grade 
teacher is shown giving facts to his students about 
climate change. “How many gallons of water does it 
take to make a single sausage?” he asks. His obedient 
congregation responds: “A thousand.” “That’s right,” 
he continues, “and how many showers does that 
add up to?” Again, the children respond: “Fifty.” 
Following this chorus, a young girl is shown fainting, 
her frilled shoes flying up into the air. 
For those who watch the show, you will recognize 
this as the moment Amabella (Ivy George, “Girl 
Meets World”), the daughter of the vivacious, 
headstrong Renata (Laura Dern, “F is for Family”) 
passes out from a panic attack — a panic attack 
induced by her teacher’s lessons on climate change. 
Renata, of course, is never one to take things lightly, 
and goes strutting down to the principal’s office with 
an aura of royalty only a blazer-clad Laura Dern can 
convey. After unloading on the forlorn principal, she 
leaves us with pure poetry: “I will be rich again. I 
will rise up. I will buy a … polar bear for every kid in 
this school. Then I’ll squish you like the bug you are.” 
Besides this being an excellent representation of the 
wealthy’s response to the threat of climate change, 
this scene also opened up discussion for a topic that is 
becoming more and more relevant: climate anxiety.
As the peril to our world at the hands of our 
changing climate increases and our government 
officials look the other way, anxiety about the end 
of the world is rampant. It’s gotten so bad that the 
American Psychological Association released a 
69-page guide for mental health care providers on 
how to help patients cope with “eco-anxiety.” There 
are support networks dedicated to helping people 
deal with their climate anxiety, and many people 
have sworn off having children due to concern for 
how life will be for coming generations. 

And why shouldn’t people be worried? Every day 
the new headlines pop up: “Air pollution is linked to 
miscarriages,” “250,000 deaths from climate change 
is a ‘conservative estimate,’” “Trump Administration 
weakens Endangered Species Act.” The future of our 
world is getting bleaker and bleaker, and anxiety isn’t 
just coming from this fact. The changing climate is 
leading to wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes and 
other repeated natural disasters that threaten the 
lives and stability of people across the globe. If the 
afflicted individuals weren’t already suffering from 
some sort of climate-induced anxiety, the trauma 
and loss they endure as a result of climate change 
may lead to PTSD, depression and anxiety about an 
impending natural disaster. 
Yeah, this is all really depressing. If I was a 
second grader learning about this I probably would 
have fainted, too. Because truly, what can we do? 
Speaking as someone who struggles with anxiety, 
I understand that this distress stems from a lack of 
control. The climate is changing — and? Even with 
all of the recycling, veganism and plastic bans in 
the world, nothing will truly be done about climate 
change until the government and corporations 
change the way they fundamentally run. We have 
less than 50 years until our world is sure to become 
inhabitable, and our elected officials are spending 
their time making fun of a 16-year-old girl doing her 
best to save the planet. 
The sad truth about climate change is that it’s here 
and it’s getting worse. No matter how many painted 
signs or sustainable t-shirts you wear, nothing will 
stop it except systemic change. Not even Laura Dern, 
with all of her power, might and enormous wealth 
can stop it. The only thing we can do is take all of 
the anger and anxiety and channel it into something 
productive. Call your representatives, show up to 
the polls, boycott polluting companies, try to cut 
down on meat consumption, stop buying single-use 
plastics. If the older generations won’t care for a 
world they won’t be around for, shut them down and 
vote them out. And in 20 or 30 years — polar bears 
for everyone. 

Nervous about the end?

Will God forgive us? It’s a question that’s asked 
time and time again throughout Paul Schrader’s film 
“First Reformed.” It’s a question I find myself asking 
whenever I read yet another headline announcing the 
death of a species, the melting of a glacier or the failure 
of another climate agreement. Like most humans, 
especially young humans with (hopefully) many 
more years on this planet, I am afraid for my future. 
I am afraid of rising temperatures and everything 
they are expected to bring with them: crop failures, 
climate refugees, more extreme weather, more pain, 
more suffering. My fear grows stronger every day, and 
I still don’t quite know how to deal with it. 
The characters in “First Reformed” are afraid, too. 
The entire film is drenched in a despair that many of 
us feel to the core — guilt about what we have done, 
anxiety about what is going to happen next. Two 
men in particular feel it most acutely: Ethan Hawke 
(“Before Midnight”) as Reverend Toller, a well-
meaning but tormented pastor and Philip Ettinger 
(“Indignation”) as Michael, a soon-to-be father 
obsessed with the coming end of the world. 
Toller lets his despair about both climate change 
and the death of his son eat him alive, partaking in 
binge drinking he knows might just kill him. He is 
a dying man on a dying planet and he hardly cares 
enough to save himself. Michael, though physically 
healthy compared to Toller, is grieved by the new life 
carried by his wife Mary (Amanda Seyfried, “Mamma 
Mia!”). At one point he asks Toller, “But how can you 
sanction bringing a girl … a child full of hope and 
naive belief into a world … when that little girl grows 
to be a young woman and looks you in the eyes and 
says, ‘You knew all along, didn’t you?’”
Both Toller and Michael are overwhelmed by this 
despair — it’s so easy to let it overwhelm you. In the 

face of the megacorporations and billionaires who 
run our world, it’s natural to feel small, to feel helpless 
in saving the earth. The power of these feelings is 
only amplified when we convince ourselves that these 
feelings are ours alone, something we must confront 
on our own.
For most of “First Reformed,” characters appear 
detached from each other, physically and emotionally 
tethered to their own bodies. A profound sense 
of loneliness pervades the film’s cold, biting New 
England winter. But there are brief, striking moments 
of intimacy too, and this intimacy is precisely 
what brings characters out of their despair. Every 
interaction between Toller and Mary is electric, and 
just a touch of their hands inspires a transcendent, 
psychedelic dream sequence. In this sequence, we see 
the two soaring over beautiful natural landscapes. 
This scenery, though, is soon swapped out for images 
showing heaps upon heaps of trash, air-polluting 
factories and other man-made ecological nightmares. 
Once these images come to the forefront, Toller and 
Mary are removed from the picture entirely. Their 
love and their connection simply cannot exist in that 
world. We cannot exist in that world, at least not for 
much longer.
Maybe saving the planet in order to save our lives 
and the lives of the people we love is selfish. After all, 
we alone are responsible for climate change and we 
alone are obligated to fix it; we should feel compelled 
to do whatever we can to reverse the course the planet 
is heading toward out of sheer humanity and decency. 
But if selfishness is the thing that can ultimately save 
us from ourselves, I can’t imagine a better, more 
worthy motivator than love. 
Climate change is real and it’s happening right 
now. More than 97 percent of scientists agree. And 
we’re running out of time before our descendants no 
longer have a healthy and habitable earth to live and 
love on. And that — love — matters. Of course it does. 
It matters more than anything.

B-SIDE: TV NOTEBOOK

Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators 
of “South Park,” never apologize. Even 
after getting banned in China last week for 
satirizing Chinese censorship on the episode 
“Band In China,” the duotweeteda mock 
apology. “We too love money more than 
freedom and democracy,” the statement reads. 
“We good now, China?” (South Park and China 
are currently not good).
The humor in “South Park” usually falls on 
a spectrum from woke and relevant to kind 
of fucked up. Still, the show and its creators 
always 
stand 
by 
their 
sometimes-shitty 
message. But once — and onlyonce, as far as my 
research shows — did “South Park” go back on 
their word. In 2018, they reversed their stance 
on a topic they had once laughed off: climate 
change.
In the 2006 episode “ManBearPig” where 
Parker and Stone first took a stance, Al Gore 
presents to South Park Elementary: “There 
is something out there which threatens our 
very existence … I’m talking of course, about 
ManBearPig. ManBearPig doesn’t care who 
you are or what you’ve done. ManBearPig 
simply wants to get you.”
The euphemism of a “half-man, half-bear, 
half-pig” boogie monster speaks to Parker and 
Stone’s impression of global warming: Climate 
change is something silly and unrealistic, a 
childish fear, even an impossibility. The duo 
doubles down on that impression in show’s 
2007 “Imaginationland” arc — ManBearPig 
appears as a character in Imaginationland, a 
world full of made-up characters, suggesting 
climate change is imaginary.
While palpable and perceptible today, 
especially among the activism of Ann Arbor, 
this impression of climate change as something 
absurd wasn’t uncommon in the 2000s. In a 
2009 report by Yale University, only 18 percent 
of Americans were taking action about climate 
change. Another 33 percent believed in it but 
did not feel personally threatened by the issue; 
the remaining 49 percent ranged from flimsy 
belief to total dismissal.
Today “South Park” is a clear criticism of 
American culture and politics, but earlier 
seasons were less satire, more juvenile 
humor. By the time “ManBearPig” aired in 
’06, the show was full-fledged commentary, 
and the episode accuses Al Gore of being 
alarmist and self-serving. It especially mocks 
“An Inconvenient Truth,” the documentary 
chronicling his global warming awareness 
campaign. The end of the episode makes the 
show’s position clear when Stan has an angry 
outburst at Gore: “You just use ManBearPig 
as a way to get attention for yourself because 
you’re a loser!”
Twelve years later, “South Park” revisits 
climate change on season 22’s “Nobody Got 
Cereal?” and “Time to Get Cereal.” In 2018, 
it would turn out that the smug Al Gore was 
right all along, when the two-episode special 
opened with an attack from a realManBearPig.
In a telling scene, a father speaks to his wife 
while his family enjoys dinner at Red Lobster. 

“There’s no scientific proof, no real evidence 
of a ManBearPig,” he says over a glass of wine. 
Just as he begins to explain, ManBearPig 
itself bursts into the restaurant window. As 
the father continues to deny ManBearPig’s 
existence, the monster wreaks havoc in the 
background, destroying everything in its 
reach and killing all bystanders. When his 
wife points to the pandemonium behind him, 
he simply observes, “OK, ManBearPig is real 
… what are we gonna do that’s gonna make any 
difference now, Susan?” The monster devours 
him just as he begins to blame ManBearPig on 
China. Parker and Stone’s new target in 2018 
is not an alarmist Al Gore, but the delusional 
climate change denier. In a total flip of opinion 
from “South Park,” the climate change denier 
is depicted as more smug and self-absorbed 
than Al Gore was twelve years earlier.
The everyday ambivalence toward climate 
change held by society at large is maybe the 
most mocked. As fires rage in South Park 
and citizens scream with terror throughout 
the town, the community center hosts a 
presentation titled “When should I start 
to worry?” One character asks, “I’m pretty 
sure there’s a ManBearPig and I’m fairly 
certain that he’s eaten two of my children 
and destroyed our home. When should I start 
to worry?” Another character says, “I don’t 
know if I believe in ManBearPig or not, but I 
do know that I am open to the idea of starting 
to worry,” earning proud applause from the 
audience for his bravery. In a local TV talk 
show discussion, one character declares, 
“I don’t think there’s any more room for not 
considering underestimating the importance 
of beginning to start the process of mulling 
over the conceptualization of starting to 
worry. And the time to do it is very soon.”
Baby boomers are blamed for climate change 
when Stan confronts his grandpa in the senior 
home, accusing the older generation of making 
a deal with ManBearPig. One old lady says, “We 
thought we’d be dead by now! We didn’t think 
we’d have to live to see the consequences!” 
Stan accuses them of signing his future away, 
to which his grandpa admits they traded the 
present joy of cars and ice cream in exchange 
for ManBearPig’s inevitable return. The show 
mocks a generation of people who greedily 
chose to enjoy frivolous luxuries without 
thought for the future.
In classic “South Park” fashion, the show 
makes a prediction of sorts. Stan enters 
negotiations with ManBearPig, who offers to 
never return so long as the town gives up two 
things: soy sauce and “Red Dead Redemption 
2.” But those luxuries are too much to sacrifice, 
so in order to keep them, Stan signs away the 
lives of all children in third world countries, 
putting off ManBearPig’s return for five more 
years, during which the carnage will be a 
thousandfold higher.
This is the most grim assessment made 
by “South Park”: Action to prevent climate 
change will only be put off again. Swap soy 
sauce and “Red Dead Redemption 2” for beef 
and fossil fuels, and the reality of climate 
change is depicted perfectly. As I fuel up my 
car at the gas station and pick up burgers to 
grill, I wonder if I should start to worry.

B-SIDE: BOOKS NOTEBOOK

It’s difficult, if not impossible, to write a 
novel “about” climate change. Much like dealing 
with its ramifications in the day-to-day life of 
one individual, futility starts to set in when 
confronting such an enormous problem woven 
so tightly with modern society. It sometimes 
seems like the more climate change becomes an 
existential threat, the more difficult it is to talk 
about. Even as novels are increasingly written 
in a broad scope, incorporating multiple voices 
and experimental techniques, the form of the 
novel at its core still relies on the subjectivity of 
individuals who are, generally speaking, not the 
very few executives and government officials 
responsible for the stasis of society in responding 
to climate change. It’s possible, though, that 
novelists are responding to the effects of climate 
change in ways other than direct representation. 
The kind of numbing anxiety that necessarily 
has to coexist with mundanity has been poking 
its head into numerous recent works of fiction, 
possibly because it has seemed to increasingly 
saturate daily life. 
Julia 
Phillips’s 
brilliant 
debut 
novel 
“Disappearing Earth” is what Jane Allison calls 
a “radial” narrative — one where some inciting 
incident creates ripples that move outward 
and often compound in complexity rather than 
resolving. Novels structured like this frequently 
resemble a loose amalgamation of short stories, 
but Phillips succeeds in her deft, transparent 
prose and her ability to play narratives off each 
other in a prismatic way. It coheres in its creation 
of a community of people, in this case in an 
incredibly isolated city in Russia. The plot orbits 
around the mysterious disappearance of two 
young girls, Sophia and Alyona Golosovsky, in the 
coastal town of Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka 
peninsula. Everyone in the town hears about it, is 
haunted by it. Suddenly, other young girls aren’t 
allowed to cross town to see friends, adults are 
newly nervous about the other residents of the 
small seaside town. Predictably enough, some 
people in town use the disappearance as an 
opportunity to stoke racial and ethnic tension. 
An elementary school administrator, Valentina 
Nikolaevna, blames the disappearance first on a 

Central Asian and then on the father of the girls, 
who lives in Moscow. 
The theme of the book, broadly stated, is the 
parochialism, blame and anxiety that ripples 
through a community in the wake of grief. The 
feelings the girls’ disappearance 
evokes in the town are rarely 
straightforward, but they get into 
everything, their presence is felt 
everywhere. They are dismissed, 
relegated, 
compartmentalized 
only to hover over the scenes of 
the novel in a blanket of worry. 
The girls’ disappearance is used 
as a justification for a boyfriend’s 
anxious surveillance, and it comes 
up as two young professionals go 
on a camping trip in the “empty 
wilderness” north of the town.
This 
connection 
between 
an 
increasingly vague anxiety and 
the 
xenophobia 
that 
emerges 
is 
fairly 
straightforward, 
but 
it also feels important that the 
Kamchatka peninsula is almost 
unnavigable, where communities 
are incredibly isolated from each 
other geographically and culturally. 
The isolation amplifies this sense of 
echo. Petropavlovsk is more or less 
inaccessible by land, and the city 
has the feeling of being hemmed in, 
surrounded by nature that appears 
in many different guises. Nature 
is almost a character in the book, 
commenting on the goings-on. This 
is especially true of the stunning 
opening, which takes place in the 
hours before Sophia and Alyona are 
abducted. Alyona tells Sophia a story 
of a city at the edge of the Pacific 
ocean that was obliterated after a 
tsunami: “Even in Zavoyko, they 
didn’t notice how the sky had gotten 
darker; they were busy sweeping 
up, checking in on their next-door 
neighbors, making repairs. But later, 
when the electricity came back on, 
somebody realized there were no 
lights coming from the edge of the 
cliff.”

Climate change as an issue is abstract — we know it’s coming, 
but how many of those issues detailed in the climate report can we 
actually see, in Ann Arbor, right now? Sure, point to trends, rising 
temperatures and the melting ice caps (Iceland recently held a funeral 
for one of their melted glaciers), but has anything changed in our 
day-to-day life here that reflects any sign of climate change? Barely. 
VSCO girls may be touting their reusable straws and campus might 
have hosted a climate march, but how many red solo cups littered 
the ground the following game day? People still use single-use 
plastics, many are reluctant to even reduce their meat consumption 
and others still deny the fact that climate change even exists. But we 
know it’s coming and you’d be hard-pressed to find a scientist who 
disagrees with that fact. 
Beyond the statistics, social media has made it increasingly easy 
to feel like you care about climate change without actually doing 
anything of substance. Being able to like or reshare a story about the 
effects of climate change has made it dangerously easy to passively 
watch the world fall to flames, especially as we sit in a sheltered 
university town in Michigan. Let’s also keep in mind that our state, 
with its access to the lakes we know and love, has been deemed one 
of the better places to reside as our climate becomes more and more 
unpredictable. Pure Michigan is sounding pretty great right about 
now. None of this is to say that it’s entirely up to the individual to 
tackle climate crisis — we know it’s a systemic issue stemming from 
the roots of capitalism, but surely there is something we can do. 
Aside from calling your representatives and other forms of 
political climate activism, one of the first steps, and something we 
should all come back to from time to time, is to put ourselves in a 
situation where we can understand what we have to lose. Ignoring the 
imminent societal collapse that will come hand in hand with climate 
change is dangerous. And what is happening to the actual Earth? 
The coral is dying in Australia and the Amazon is burning in Brazil 
(though that was less climate change and more poor leadership), and 
those are both incredibly important, but when people don’t ever plan 
on visiting either of those places anytime soon, this removed feeling 
has the potential to manifest as apathy. Michigan has some gorgeous 
places to visit to combat this phenomenon, but if you don’t feel like 
driving the four hours to get to Sleeping Bear Dunes, the University’s 
botanical gardens are a one-stop shop for all your climate-apathy 
assuaging needs. 
Located right off of Dixboro road, the Matthaei Botanical Gardens 
are an Ann Arbor staple. This hidden University gem boasts gorgeous 
scenery and houses an absolutely adorable collection of Bonsai trees. 
But what sets the gardens apart and helps connect their patrons to 
the realities of climate change around them is the art exhibits that 
decorate the halls of the visitor’s center and continue throughout the 
gardens. According to the garden’s mission statement and the Public 
Events Coordinator, Alexis Ford, the art exhibits at the gardens are 
meant to “develop a strong connection with the audience in a means 
to foster enjoyment, stewardship, and sustainability.” Impressive 
words, but what does that actually look like? 
As you walk through the gardens, the art becomes apparent. The 
entrance of the Gateway Garden was commissioned to commemorate 
the Ann Arbor Garden Club’s 75th anniversary in 2005 and, walking 
deeper into the complex, you stumble upon gorgeous fountains 
surrounded by insane bursts of colorful flowers. Trees loom in the 
distance, and if you visit in October like I did, the leaves have turned 
from summer greens to vibrant reds, oranges and yellows. Seeing 
the art, surrounded by various plants, evokes a calming feeling. In a 
phone interview with The Daily, Ford spoke to how these pieces are 
chosen and their purpose within the gardens. 
Ford explained that artists can be commissioned to create 
something for the gardens, or come up with and pitch their own 

ideas. Once approved, the art is put up in the gardens and its visitor 
center, which Ford described as a “non-traditional gallery space,” — 
a fitting arena for an organization dealing with the non-traditional 
problem of emotionally connecting people to climate change. In 
thinking about the role of the gardens in combating an indifference 
toward climate change, Ford pointed out that, when selecting the art, 
she’s not looking for “a pretty picture on the wall.” She emphasized 
the importance of instilling a feeling of “why” — why is the garden 
important to visitors? Why are these pieces of art specifically here, 
at the gardens? Eventually, she wants the art to prompt people to 
consider what their role is in this precarious environment. 
The fountains, the gates and the other permanent exhibits, 
however, aren’t all that Matthaei has to offer. Ford talked about the 
importance of working with people in and around the community to 
create opportunities in which visitors can experience art in different 
ways through the Matthaei Botanical Gardens. Take, for example, 
Metthaei’s collaboration with the Center for World Performance 
Studies this past March. Composer Raven Chacon brought “The 
Living Earth Show” to the gardens and performed an engaging 
piece exploring “the urgent but approaching crisis of water shortage 
burdening the region from California to the Navajo deserts.”
“(Art is) not a two-dimensional painting on a wall — it is an 
immersive experience. So, art can often involve video aspects of 
dance or theatrical aspects,” Ford said. 
Ford also mentioned that in the future, Matthaei is trying to 
further the experience of developing art that has a strong connection 
with nature but also “exploring what that means for the particular 
artist.” Matthaei is currently accepting submissions for their 
latest community exhibit surrounding our micro environment and 
challenging our existing views of nature from the human perspective. 
It’s an exhibit meant to explore nature as if we were the small things 
living in it — the bees and the birds and everything in between. 
After visiting Matthaei, I started wondering what goes behind 
creating a garden itself. Once you’ve come to terms with the 
overwhelming “eco-anxiety” that seems to plague our generation, 
it becomes increasingly clear that there are ways to give back to 
your environment in meaningful ways. This past summer, I spent an 
absurd amount of my time scrolling through gardens on Instagram, 
watching as people built the gardens of my dreams. As someone 
whose green thumb is a little more on the brown side, I decided it 
would be beneficial to talk to someone about it. 
In a phone interview with The Daily, Lindsay Wilkinson, a 2002 
alum of the University’s School of Social Work and an avid gardener, 
talked about getting her garden 
started and the nuances behind 
creating 
a 
mini 
botanical 
garden at her home. Aside 
from how beautiful the flowers 
were, the most intriguing thing 
about the garden was the large 
amount of wildlife that seemed 
to always be present. From 
her Instagram, it would seem 
that this was because she had 
decided to make it a butterfly 
garden, 
planting 
specific 
plants meant to attract certain 
butterflies, like milkweed, the 
preferred snack of monarch 
butterflies. 
“When (my family) first 
moved into (the) house, the 
former owners were really into 
trying to establish more native 
species onto the property. And, 
honestly, that was a concept 
that I had not really looked 

at. Why would you plant plants that were meant to be in your area 
versus plants that were ornamental and were considered pretty by 
your big box stores?” 
Wilkinson’s family has always had a vegetable garden in their 
backyard, but this new garden was a product of observing the nature 
around her. “Living the first summer in our garden and just having 
this huge bank of native coneflower growing on the back side of our 
house, all I had to do was step back into our backyard to be witness 
to the fact that … these echinacea are covered with butterflies,” 
Wilkinson said.
The concept of growing native plants isn’t necessarily a 
revolutionary thing to do — once you really think about it, it’s just 
common sense. But that doesn’t make it any less intriguing. 
“Planting native is a neat idea because it’s just going to enhance 
and perpetuate and support what’s meant to be there,” Wilkinson 
said. As a result, her garden and lawn has remained pesticide free. 
She has to contend with certain bugs, like aphids, invading her 
garden, but she advises that if you’re planting things that attract 
ladybugs (a natural aphid predator), then nature, not pesticides, does 
the work for you.
Not only does the garden provide a summer haven, but as 
Wilkinson prepares to get ready for Michigan’s winter, it also creates 
a home for the bugs to stay when the cold hits. While her vegetables 
go into the house, her coneflowers to stay outside and become hollow 
— the perfect home for caterpillars and other bugs to spend the 
colder months. 
The garden has proven to be a community staple. She voiced her 
concerns about having such a prominent garden (Wilkinson counted 
nine neighboring homes that could see straight into the garden). But 
she needn’t have worried. The garden prompted her to have more 
conversations with her neighbors in one summer than in the other 
three summers that she lived in the house. 
Art is just as much of a dynamic concept as climate change, though 
a little less threatening, and the different ways we interact with it can 
affect how we choose to cope with things as scary as a climate crisis. 
For some, gardening is just as much an art as creating a sculpture 
or writing an opera. Creating a diverse, sustainable garden offers 
insight into what it means to be a part of this world. We should move 
towards ways of artistic expression that allow us to understand the 
environment and our local ecosystems better as a whole. While our 
long-term goal of overthrowing capitalism looms in the distance, we 
can find ways to subvert the system and give back to the environment 
by actively questioning our relationship with the world around us.

Weed it out: Gardening to understand the environment

ALEXIS RANKIN / DAILY

It is difficult to describe an archetypal day in the life of Antonio Rafael. In 
his teens, he was commuting from Detroit, his hometown, to a private high 
school in the suburbs. He attended college at Eastern Michigan University, 
where he studied economics. After Detroit filed for bankruptcy and was 
subjected to state intervention, Rafael became increasingly vocal as an 
activist and artist in his community. Most recently, he has devoted the bulk of 
his time and energy to environmental anti-racism and activism and has taken 
on a variety of roles in the process, including outdoor educator, urban farmer 
and beekeeper.
Needless to say, Rafael has worn an overwhelming number of hats, but it 
seems that this process of constant evolution is part and parcel of the life of 
an activist. How else can we expect our leaders to keep leading, amid ever-
mounting burdens of historical oppression and ever-increasing awareness of 
all the insidious ways that structures of oppression likewise evolve and adapt? 
On the subject of his personal evolution into environmental activism, 
Rafael described a parallel development he’s seen in his approach as an 
activist. 
“Changing people’s consciousness is beautiful and rewarding. I love to see 
the analysis and thought of people around me grow and evolve and change, 
but like, I also want to do something tangible, you know?” said Rafael in an 
interview with The Daily. He then went on to describe “Southwest Grows,” 
the community farm he has started behind his house in Detroit, with hopes of 
someday turning it into a market garden.

Rafael is not alone in these efforts to push for the adaptation of agricultural 
practices outside of rural environments. His native Detroit is becoming a hub 
for the nationwide urban farming movement. Farms like Rafael’s are part of 
grassroots campaigns for “food sovereignty” in marginalized communities, 
which seek to reclaim control of the local food system. To that end, Rafael 
has other projects lined up as well. This semester, he is partnering with 
the National Wildlife Federation on a program with an ambitious goal: 
to “create the next generation of environmental and conservation leaders 
from communities that are most impacted by environmental racism.” This 
program will take the form of after-school workshops in three Detroit high 
schools and will feature both indoor and outdoor curriculums in order to 
promote historical, community-based and pragmatic knowledge of the 
environment.
Rafael’s work seems inextricable from the city of Detroit and the metro 
area. Many of his environmental projects of his are literally rooted in 
the city’s soil, and his street art from years prior is often anchored to said 
streets, appearing as murals and graffiti on the facades of buildings and 
even, infamously, on a water tower overlooking Highland Park. Despite this 
rootedness, throughout our conversation Rafael also vigilantly drew parallels 
between Detroit’s situation and those of other communities, historically and 
transnationally. In fact, Rafael described this global consciousness as one of 
the positive markers of modern-day activism. 
“We need to be specializing and working on specific issues within various 
issue communities, but we also need to be looking at the interconnection 
of issues, and I think that’s another thing that’s really unique about our 
generation and something we’re growing and learning through,” Rafael said.
Every so often, his responses to questions would reverberate in ways that 
confirmed this conviction. This 
was particularly resonant when 
Rafael was discussing the colonial 
critique often at the center of his 
artwork, both in the United States 
and Latin America. 
“Everyone’s talking about the 
Amazon forests burning, and 
they’re like, ‘That’s the world’s 
lungs!’ — but the world’s lungs 
were here, too,” Rafael observed, 
in a statement that lived at 
the 
intersection 
between 
his 
community and something larger, 
something interconnected and 
infinite.
In that way, he reminded me 
of other activists who fought for 
change in Detroit throughout their 
lives, like the late Grace Lee and 
Jimmy Boggs, and the still-active 
Tawana Petty. In fact, Rafael had 
attended the latter’s birthday 
party a few weeks prior to our 

interview. And while Rafael spoke with admiration for the work of the Boggs 
and their legacy, he spoke at length and with the greatest enthusiasm about 
his contemporaries in the local activist community. It was perhaps his fellow 
graffiti artists for whom he expressed the most admiration, recommending 
the work of street artists like Sintex and Chaos and calling the city of Detroit 
a “graffiti mecca.”
Images of Rafael’s graffiti and other works of art are surprisingly hard 
to come by online. More often than not, such photos can only be found in 
articles reporting on his public, unsanctioned projects — the ones that upset 
the police. The aforementioned Highland Park water tower, onto which 
Rafael and another artist William Lucka spray painted the words “Free the 
Water” and a raised fist, made a number of headlines, especially when the 
two were facing potential felony charges for it. But that might not be a bad 
thing. I’m starting to reevaluate the importance of context to a piece of art, 
and to question whether or not works of art, especially community-centric 
artwork like Rafael’s, should be excavated from the environs in which they 
were created and, in a way, also had a hand in creating them. 
Rafael was definitely the one who set in motion my reconceptualization of 
art and how it translates across space and time. At one point, I described to him 
a dilemma brought to my attention through my coursework in the University 
of Michigan’s Community Action and Social Change program: That it is easy 
to name what a movement or work is against, but it is much more difficult to 
name what it is for. I asked Rafael for his take on this question, and I did not 
see his answer coming. 
“When my house and farm are done,” he said, “that will be an articulation 
of what I’m for. It’s an ongoing art project that I’m working on, my house 
and farm.” I’d never thought of environmental work that way, as a form of 
speech, as a work of art. But how narrow-minded is that? Perhaps if we saw 
the environment as a work of art, as another being communicating with us, 
I imagine the conversation around climate change would shift dramatically, 
and for the better. I also wonder what Rafael’s garden might say, were I ever 
to see it in person. I imagine something like, This is where it begins, but who 
knows — perhaps I’ll find out for myself someday.
