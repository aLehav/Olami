LSA senior Bradley Ebenhoeh 
was in a residence hall when 
unfounded reports of an active 
shooter in Mason Hall surfaced 
March 16.
“I was in East Quad, and they 
(the Resident Advisors) ... told 
us there was an active shooter 
and recommended to us to get 
downstairs,” 
Ebenhoeh 
said. 
“That made me feel frightened 
because there was no response 
from the University.”
Ebenhoeh, 
who 
uses 
a 
wheelchair, said he felt especially 
frightened because he had not 
been previously informed of any 
protocol regarding the ‘run, hide, 

fight’ notification that was later 
administered by the University 
of Michigan on March 16 — 
specifically for students with 
disabilities, faculty and staff.
“I move slower than everybody 
else, so when they said, ‘run, 
hide and fight,’ I could not run,” 
Ebenhoeh said.
According to the Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
website, ‘run, hide, fight’ is a 
three-step protocol for an active 
attacker situation. Run — the first 
step — means to get away from 
the threat as soon as possible. 
If a clear path of escape is not 
possible, the second step — hide — 
says to find a secure place to hide 
and barricade yourself. The final 

step — fight — says to distract 
and/or incapacitate the attacker. 
This step is only recommended if 
one’s life is in imminent danger.
However, the online policy 
only briefly addresses individuals 
such as Ebenhoeh, who cannot 
run from the situation. The 
section ‘Other Circumstances 
to Consider’ on the ‘Active 
Attacker’ page of the DPSS 
website says to contact DPSS 
with specific concerns regarding 
disabled people or other special 
circumstances.
“How you respond to an active 
attacker will be dictated by the 
specific circumstances of the 
encounter,” the page reads. “In 
addition, many in our community 

may need to respond differently 
as a result of a disability, caregiver 
relationship, 
leadership 
role, 
unique workspace location, or a 
variety of other reasons. Please 
contact us to discuss any specific 
concerns you may have. Always 
remember your options: run, hide 
or fight.”
Ebenhoeh said he did not get 
any official notification from the 
University until approximately 
20 to 30 minutes after the reports 
surfaced. He said he was only 
informed of policy regarding fire 
drills — another policy he does 
not think is accomodating to 
disabled people.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

On Monday, the University 
of 
Michigan 
LSA 
Student 
Government hosted a candidate 
debate ahead of the upcoming 
election on March 27 and 
28. 
Three 
presidential-vice 
presidential candidate tickets 
debated 
issues 
regarding 

community 
outreach, 
the 
LSA 
language 
requirement, 
inclusivity and diversity of the 
Assembly. The event consisted 
of eight questions asked by 
Michigan Daily Senior News 
Editor Remy Farkas, followed by 
questions from the audience. The 
questions, compiled by The Daily, 
included challenging the LSA SG 
budget, current resolutions and 
the SG’s internal and external 
relations.
The 2019 LSA executive board 
elections are contested for the 

first time since 2014 with three 
tickets of a presidential and 
vice-presidential 
candidate: 
Brian Wang and Mary McKillop; 
Nicholas 
Bonde 
and 
Kevan 
Casson; and Jon Reid and Wyatt 
Puscas.
The 
debate 
began 
with 
opening statements from each 
ticket. LSA sophomore Mary 
McKillop said she would like 
to focus on creating a more 
representative government that 
listens to its constituents on her 
platform with Wang.

“We’re both extremely proud 
of the platform we put together 
and we hope the other students 
in LSA see the commitment we’re 
prepared to bring,” McKillop 
said. “We also believe that the 
government itself deserves to be 
more represented by people who 
understand the common issues 
on campus, not just by those who 
say they want to fix things on 
campus.”

Tenisha 
Yancey, 
a 
representative from the 1st 
District 
of 
the 
Michigan 
House 
of 
Representatives 
who has two felonies and two 
misdemeanors on her record, 
spoke on Saturday about how 
she became successful despite 
her criminal record. As the 
first keynote speaker at the 
Confined Minds II: Education, 
Programming, 
Incarceration 
conference, Yancey explained 
how she was able to use 
her 
education 
to 
become 
a 
successful 
attorney 
and 
Michigan 
congresswoman, 
despite the numerous people 
who told her she couldn’t due 
to her criminal history.
Alongside 
Yancey, 
state 

legislators, 
educators, 

students 
and 
community 
leaders 
joined 
inmates 
at 
Macomb Correctional Facility 
to discuss the importance of 
education and programming 
in prisons.

The names of some sources 
have been excluded due to 
their undocumented status.

Monday 
night, 
the 
Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, 
a University of Michigan 
organization that aims to 
support undocumented and 
“DACAmented” 
students 
on campus, held their first 
public event with about 50 
people in attendance in the 
Student Activities Building. 
The 
event, 
entitled 
Here 
to 
Stay: 
Undocumented 
Students at U-M focused 
on 
the 
experiences 
of 
undocumented students at 
the University and initiatives 
SCOPE is hoping to achieve 
in the coming years. They 
also 
discussed 
resources 
for undocumented students 
and how allies can become 
involved in advocacy. 
Before the event, SCOPE 
member Barbara Diaz, an 
LSA senior, explained the 
importance of the event and 
what she wished more people 
knew about undocumented 
students.
“Undocumented 
students 
are students here,” Diaz said. 

“I think a lot of the time 
people forget that we kind of 
exist and that we’re part of 
this campus community.”
The 
event 
began 
with 
a 
video 
produced 
by 
SCOPE 
about 
the 
effect 
the 
organization 
had 
on 
its 
members. 
Those 
who 
appeared 
in 
the 
video 
gave advice to prospective 
students, urging them to “not 
to give up when applying to 
U-M,” and to “have courage 
and be brave.”
The first student member 
of SCOPE who spoke at the 
event discussed the difficulty 
of being ineligible for certain 
financial 
assistance. 
He 
explained how in previous 
years 
the 
University 
has 
not given in-state tuition 
to undocumented students, 
despite them having lived and 
attending school in Michigan 
for the majority of their life.
“They’re good enough to 
attend U-M, but don’t think 
they can,” he said. “They 
claim to be the leaders and 
the best — let’s see it.”
Another SCOPE member 
who spoke later in the event 
also discussed the struggles 
surrounding financial aid for 
undocumented students.

About 30 people gathered in 
the Earl V. Moore Building on 
the University of Michigan’s 
North Campus Monday evening 
for a discussion-based event 
hosted by TEDxUofM and 
the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance’s EXCEL Lab. The 
TEDxUofM 
Salon 
revolved 
around the theme of activism 
in the arts, approaching the 
idea with an interactive event. 
As opposed to the conference 
hosted 
by 
TEDxUofM 
in 
February, the salons are meant 
to be smaller and more intimate 
discussions.
LSA senior Allison Radman 
helped organize the event and 
gave background on the purpose 
of TEDxUofM.
“These salons are supposed 

to be more discussion-based 
events where we kind of bring 
together the community and 
talk about a specific topic,” 
Radman said. 
The events are supposed to 
spark an interactive discussion 
as well as highlight interesting 
speakers and experiences.
“The arts as activism is … 
such an interesting discussion 
and that’s why TedxUofM is so 
interested in having this kind of 
event,” Radman said.
The event started with a 
TEDx video featuring artist 
and activist Marcus Ellsworth. 
Following the video, attendees 
split into small groups to discuss 
reactions and the role art plays 
in activism.
Melissa 
Coppola 
is 
the 
program 
assistant 
for 
the 
EXCEL Lab in the Music, 
Theatre & Dance School. EXCEL 
is a place for entrepreneurship, 

leadership and career services 
within the realm of performing 
arts.
“In the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance the EXCEL 
program is relatively new,” 
Coppola said. “And one of the 
things that we do is provide 
funding for students with all 
different sorts of projects, from 
performance-based down to 
things with much greater social 
impact.”
Coppola hopes the EXCEL 
Lab can help students who are 
interested in both the arts and 
activism, but who are unsure 
about what that can look like.
“I think for a lot of students, 
it’s really hard to understand 
what that looks like because it 
can take many different forms, 
and today’s event I think is just 
kind of getting people to think 
about what the arts can look like 
when you’re trying to make a 
change in the community 
you live in,” Coppola said.
The featured speaker 
of the event was Deekah 
Rox, program director 
of Girls Rock Detroit and 
founder of the Cosmic 
Slop Music Festival. Rox 
became 
interested 
in 
rock music at a young age, 
partially inspired by her 
father’s love of music.
“My 
dad 
told 
me 
growing up that there’s a 
song for every occasion,” 
Rox said.
Rox 
opened 
the 
event by describing her 
childhood on the eastside 
of Detroit with a loving 
family. 
She 
described 
feeling from a young age 
as if she lived in between 
two worlds because of her 
music taste.
“It was very obvious 
from an early age that I 
was not necessarily into 
the same stuff that the 
rest of the kids in the 
neighborhood were into,” 

Rox said.
Rox remembers her music 
interests 
straying 
from 
what others thought of as 
stereotypically Black.
“In 
my 
headphones, 
the 
music did not necessarily reflect 
the environment that I lived 
in, stereotypically,” Rox said. 
“It made it very uncomfortable 
because I always felt like I was 
trying to be Black enough for 
my Black friends, and trying to 
calm down my Blackness for my 
white friends.”
Rox 
also 
described 
her 
experience in theater as she was 
young, saying it helped her learn 
more about performance and 
herself.
“It kind of helped me carve 
out my place, or what felt like my 
place, even though there were 
some stereotypes that were 
reinforced,” she said. “Because 
I’m a loud Black chick, so I got 
all the loud Black chick roles.”
Rox described her various 
performance experiences, as 
well as being part of a band. 
Despite these experiences, she 
still felt like she was in between 
two worlds.
“I still felt like, every time I 
showed up somewhere with this 
guitar, uncomfortable,” she said.
One of the memories she looks 
back on fondly is the creation of 
the Cosmic Slop Music Festival, 
a place for rock musicians of 
color to come together. Most of 
all, Rox and other Black Detroit-
based rock musicians created 
the festival to be a safe space for 
all people.
“You miss that feeling of being 
in a room that is a safe space,” 
Rox said. “Microaggressions 
are everywhere. I just walked 
away from a very, very good 
paying job because I am not 
going to be able to be the token 
Black girl.”

“E-sports have been around 
for a very, very long time, and I 
think with our department and, 
‘Why now?’ is just the growing 
popularity of e-sports,” Barton 
said. “We see it on ESPN, and 
all over the news and it’s just 
a 
growing 
popularity 
among 
students.”
Mike Widen, the director of 
Recreational Sports, said in an 
email statement the desire for 
teams to compete and foster a large 
e-sports community on campus 
is growing. This new program 
will provide e-sports clubs with 
the same opportunity to develop 
communities as club-sports teams 
experience.
“We already have a number of 
other programs that are in place 
to help students build connections 
with each other and with the 
institution, and Esports will do 
the same for the students who 
are playing these games,” Widen 
wrote. “It was because of those 
opportunities for connections and 
the interest of the students that 
led us to develop this program. 
The students have shared a desire 
to compete with other University 
programs 
and 
represent 
the 
U-M. An Esports program in 
Recreational Sports will allow that 
to happen in the same way it does 
in our Club Sports program.”
Arbor Esports, the student 
organization 
of 
approximately 
250 students, currently meets in 
the Ross School of Business and 

each player is required to bring 
their own computer equipment 
to 
participate. 
Arbor 
Esports 
President 
Alexander 
Downs, 
Business sophomore, said the 
organization gives students a 
community to game together.
“People who don’t typically play 
traditional sports and are just more 
gamers and go to class, they’ll have 
something to do on campus other 
than just go to class and they can 
come to our events,” Downs said.
Barton said she hopes the new 
Recreational Sports program will 
be able to provide students with 
a space to play. According to the 
University press release, creating 
that space and obtaining proper 
equipment is dependent on private 
and 
corporate 
donations 
and 
corporate sponsorships.
“Right now, the group that we 
are working with a lot, the student 
group, they are operating just 
by reserving rooms on campus 
where they gather and compete, 
but we are really looking forward 
to the help from donors to have 
a space built specifically for our 
e-sports program,” Barton said. 
“Right now, there’s not a space 
dedicated to them. We hope that 
the sponsorship and really getting 
the word out about this e-sports 
program, that we’ll get some help 
from donors to create a space for 
them.”
Downs said potential spaces 
for e-sports on campus would 
be extremely beneficial for the 
membership.

The event ran from 8 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. and consisted of 
keynote speakers and panels on 
higher education and recidivism, 
programming 
in 
prisons, 
restorative justice and Inside-
Out.
The event was hosted by The 
Michigan Theory Group, a think-
tank comprised of incarcerated 
and 
non-incarcerated 
people 
aimed at changing the criminal 
justice system. The group is 
an extension of the Inside-Out 
Prison Exchange Program, an 
international program that brings 
college students into prisons to 
take classes with incarcerated 
people and challenges both the 
“inside” and “outside” students to 
listen and learn from each other.
Inside-Out 
has 
been 
implemented 
at 
more 
than 
150 colleges and universities 
in 46 states, in 12 different 
countries and in more than 200 
correctional facilities. Inside-Out 
Founder Lori Pompa said the 
program aims to create a sense 
of equality and kinship between 
the 
prisoners 
and 
college 
students and foster an open-
minded dialogue. According to 
Pompa, the classes are primarily 
taught seminar-style and try to 
transform teaching styles from 
“sage on the stage to guide on the 
side.”
Bantu Dawson, Theory Group 
member and an incarcerated 
individual, said Inside-Out was 
a catalyst for both social and 
academic change for himself and 
others at Macomb Correctional 
Facility. He claimed it offers a 
path for self-redemption.
Fellow Theory Group member 
and 
inmate 
Jemal 
Tipton 
discussed how Inside-Out is 
much more than just a classroom 
and how his experiences in the 
program changed his perspective 
on his role in society.
“You come in, and you think it’s 
just an educational experience,” 
Tipton said. “You don’t think 
it would change how you view 
the world and how you view 
your part in the world, and that’s 
what I think Inside-Out does — it 
makes me and a lot of the people 
I have interacted with take a look 
at the way we are in the world, 
individually and collectively.”
Theory group member John 
“Cowboy” 
Conklin 
is 
also 
incarcerated. He joined Inside-
Out in 2007 and said being a 
part of the program gave him 
his hope and dignity back after 
being imprisoned for 30 years 
and counting. He noted how 
inhumane 
the 
treatment 
of 
inmates can be and how Inside-
Out was able to provide an avenue 
for him to feel human again.
“When you first take the 
Inside-Out class after being 

treated like a number, not like a 
name, more like an animal, you 
walk in there and get treated as 
an equal human being,” Conklin 
said. “They give you a piece of your 
humanity back, and once you get 
a taste of that humanity, you don’t 
want it to quit. It is something you 
haven’t experienced in a very long 
time, for me it had been almost 
30 years. And I mean, I been in 
41 years and I got a taste of that 
humanity and I plan on keeping it 
as long as I can.”
However, according to Deputy 
Warden 
George 
Stephenson, 
Inside-Out 
is 
just 
one 
of 
approximately 30 programs at 
Macomb Correctional Facility. 
He claimed the facility is able to 
have so many due to available 
resources and volunteers, but 
many prisons nationwide and in 
Michigan are not as fortunate.
Inmate Tore Price, Theory 
Group member and general 
manager 
of 
Aioli’s 
II, 
the 
restaurant at the facility, said 
substance-abuse programs were 
essential to his transformation. 
He said not only did programs like 
Narcotics Anonymous help him 
help himself, they allowed him to 
give back to the community and 
help other inmates going through 
similar struggles.
Another 
well-liked, 
transformative 
program 
at 
Macomb Correctional Facility 
is Chance for Life. According to 
founder and President Thomas 
Adams, the faith-based program 
is in nine prisons and its goal is to 
change how inmates think, which 
will, in turn, change their actions.
“What we learned, way back 
when, is that it does not matter 
what you give a person, it matters 
how they think,” Adams said. 
“Anything you give them, if 
they don’t process information 
differently, then when they go out, 
they commit the same crimes and 
function in the same way. When 
we go into the institutions, we 
basically build mediation centers, 
so we’re teaching people how to 
solve their own problems from a 
peaceful perspective.”
However, the goal of the 
conference was not just to 
educate attendees about different 
programs at prisons — it was 
to demonstrate how dedicated 
incarcerated people can be to 
transforming their mindset and 
changing their lives.
Attendee Yusef Shakur, a 
formerly incarcerated individual 
and current Social Work student 
at the University of Michigan, is 
a self-described former “gang-
banger.” Shakur has been out 
of prison for 18 years and has 
used his time to self-reflect and 
improve. He said programming 
in prisons is so important because 
everyone has the potential to 
contribute positively to society, 
but factors like a lack of education 
or access can prevent those 
contributions.

“There’s, like, these weeds,” 
Shakur said. “These weeds that 
are preventing that flower from 
growing. It’s there, it’s that rose. 
But there’s all this stuff around it 
and you have to be able to remove 
that. So that self-education of 
learning about who you are to 
appreciate and get a certain 
amount of love to emerge so you 
can see the value of a different 
type of education, you can see 
the value of how to contribute to 
society that can be greater than 
what we see today.”
Shakur said the men inside the 
facility have been dedicated to 
their journey of self-redemption 
and he discussed the importance 
of 
empathy 
and 
forgiveness 
toward the incarcerated and 
formerly 
incarcerated. 
He 
claimed the United States has 
a history of committing worse 
crimes than the people in prisons, 
and he questioned why some 
people can forgive the U.S. but not 
the prison population.
“What I admire the most are 
the men inside who was once 
boys, who was once considered 
criminals or whatever and they 
transformed their lives,” Shakur 
said. “And showing that we all 
have a story of redemption; we 
all have a story of transformation. 
And the fact that we live in a 
country that has committed 
the most heinous crimes ever 
of enslaving a group of people, 
murdering a group of people, and 
the fact that we forgive them, why 
can’t we forgive these men?”
Attendee and panelist David 
LaGrand represents the 75th 
District in the Michigan House 
of 
Representatives. 
LaGrand 
discussed how, during re-entry, 
it can be difficult for the formerly 
incarcerated to find work due to 
having a public criminal record. 
He said, to resounding applause, 
he wants to introduce automatic 
expungement in Michigan.
“Only 6 percent of people who 
are eligible for expungement 
actually get it done, and that’s 
because you need a lawyer and 
you need money,” LaGrand said. 
“I am advocating for automatic 
expungement 
in 
Michigan. 
Right now, the gate is very 
narrow, there are a lot of people 
who aren’t eligible because they 
have a couple of misdemeanors 
on their record, they can’t get 
a felony expunged. I want to 
change that.”
LaGrand said he wants to 
create more economic equality 
and opportunities for people 
of all socioeconomic statuses 
in the criminal justice system. 
He said, for example, affluent 
people can hire lawyers to 
get criminal offenses off their 
records, but others do not have 
the same luxury.
“The 
criminal 
justice 
system works fairly well if 
you’re middle class or affluent 
— it doesn’t work very well if 

you’re poor,” LaGrand said. “I 
am very urgent that we do a 
better job of making sure that 
we’re not simply locking people 
up because they don’t have 
money.”
Tipton 
said 
a 
common 
problem with programming 
in prisons is that they are only 
available to those who are 
close to their release date. He 
said this takes the opportunity 
away from other inmates to 
learn, develop and grow. Tipton 
advocated for programs like 
Inside-Out and Chance for Life 
to be required upon entry into 
prison. 
“I want them to make some of 
these programs requirements 
for paroles and things like that 
because if you just give people 
certain programs, they may not 
get it,” Tipton said. “But if you 
give people programs that deal 
with their overall makeup, the 
mind, the body, the soul, and 
again how we interact, I think 
that would change people’s 
lives. For a lot of the programs, 
you have to be close to your out 
date. A lot of us are not close 
to our out date, so that’s why 
we’re so grateful for programs 
like Inside-Out and Chance 
for Life, because there’s not a 
prerequisite where you have to 
be close to your out date.”
Social Work student Megan 
Diebboll, a member of the 
Prison Creative Arts Project at 
the University of Michigan, said 
a crucial aspect of changing the 
way incarcerated people are 
viewed during both their time 
in prison and upon reentry is 
just listening to them.
“If we’re really wanting 
to take a stance in criminal 
justice, you have to have the 
voices of those who have lived 
experiences backing it up,” 
Diebboll said.
Shakur agreed with Diebboll 
and 
discussed 
how, 
while 
listening to those who have 
been incarcerated is a great 
first step, a lot more needs 
to be done. He claimed the 
system itself is unproductive, 
unfair and results in an endless 
cycle of incarceration for some 
communities.
“For 
prison 
reform 
to 
manifest itself in the way we 
desire, then the people most 
impacted by it have to lead 
that movement,” Shakur said. 
“We’re 
producing 
money 
but we’re not investing it 
back in our communities and 
our neighborhoods that are 
broken and that are producing 
broken 
men 
and 
broken 
women. If prisons become 
the opportunity to so-called 
restore these human beings, 
then we’re failing them and 
we’re failing society.”

INCARCERATION
From Page 1

According to the University’s 
fire 
evacuation 
protocol, 
people with disabilities inside a 
University building are directed 
to an “area of rescue assistance,” 
defined as “areas of refuge” by 
the state of Michigan building 
code. Floor marshals, if safe to do 
so, will conduct checks of these 
areas and convey information 
regarding people in the areas 
to emergency responders. The 
webpage does not specify where 
the areas of rescue assistance are 
in each University building.
Frank Marcinkiewicz, interim 
University fire marshal, said areas 
of refuge are readily accessible to 
individuals with disabilities and 
are conveniently located along the 
path of egress within a building. 
“These areas are clearly labeled 
with signage and will typically 
have an emergency phone device 
that connects them directly to 
University DPSS for immediate 
assistance,” Marcinkiewicz said. 
“Areas of refuge are designed 
per code to protect an individual 
from a fire-related incident for a 
defined period of time.”
According to Marcinkiewicz, 
the areas are constructed with a 
minimum of one-hour fire rating 
as required by code. This means 
the materials used to construct 
the area are able to resist 
standardized fire exposure for at 
least one hour.
Ebenhoeh 
isn’t 
the 
only 
student with concerns about 

the 
University’s 
emergency 
protocol for people with mobility 
difficulties. Elizabeth McLain, 
Music, Theater & Dance doctoral 
candidate, was a student at 
Virginia Tech in 2007 when the 
deadliest school shootings in U.S. 
history occurred on the campus, 
resulting in 32 deaths and 17 
injuries. In wake of the 12th 
anniversary of the Virginia Tech 
shooting next month, McLain said 
she was very upset that Saturday’s 
events were handled poorly.
“As a community, we’ve been 
working very hard to inform 
universities and try to prevent 
this from happening, and it kind 
of feels like a slap in the face when 
the universities don’t take what 
we’re saying seriously or don’t 
learn,” McLain said. “A delay of 
30 minutes between when the 
first people were notified and last 
people were notified is completely 
unacceptable.”
McLain, who uses a cane, also 
expressed concerns regarding the 
‘run, hide, fight’ protocol. She said 
the vast majority of people she 
spoke to did not know what the 
protocol meant and also thought 
the second and third messages 
sent out by DPSS were too vague.
“It’s a fact that when they 
send out a message saying, ‘Run, 
hide, fight,’ which is the standard 
shorthand for the advice for 
how to handle a situation, the 
vast majority of my friends who 
are fellow students, and some 
who are instructors and faculty 
members here, had no idea what 
that meant or how to use that 
guidance,” McLain said. “The 

second and third messages we 
received were so vague — they 
said, ‘You’re probably not in any 
danger,’ but they didn’t give any 
concrete instructions, so it was 
unclear if this meant we should 
shelter in place, this meant you 
should go ahead and go about 
your day — this should be clear in 
every communication.”
McLain is a graduate student 
instructor and she said she was 
not trained or made aware of 
protocol by the University on what 
to do in emergency situations 
such as the event of an active 
attacker. Though she is disabled, 
McLain said she has more options 
available to her because she uses a 
cane. She said she would not know 
the best way to assist a student 
with disabilities in her class in the 
event of an emergency.
“As 
a 
graduate 
student 
instructor, if I had a disabled 
student in my classroom while 
this was going on … I wouldn’t 
know how to help my students,” 
McLain said. “I wouldn’t know 
if I should just stay with them 
and wait it out, if elevators were 
an option — that hasn’t been 
effectively communicated to me, 
at least.”
At orientation, DPSS currently 
requires students to watch an 
active shooter safety training 
video. 
University 
community 
members 
can 
also 
request 
training workshops by going to 
the Presentations and Training 
section under Prevention and 
Education on DPSS’ website. 
While it is required for students 
to view the active shooter safety 

training video at orientation, 
Melissa Overton, deputy chief 
of police and public information 
officer for DPSS, told The Daily 
in a previous interview the 
decision to make other training 
sessions mandatory would have 
to come from a higher University 
authority. 
Overton also previously told 
The Daily that DPSS received 
many 
complaints 
of 
people 
receiving the emergency alerts 
late or not at all. She said DPSS 
is currently working to analyze 
the emergency alert system and 
determine what went wrong 
March 16.
“We 
did 
receive 
multiple 
complaints 
on 
the 
system,” 
Overton said. “… We are aware 
that some of the alerts took a lot 
longer than they should have, and 
we are looking into that.”
McLain further expressed her 
disappointment in the protocol 
and its lack of catering to disabled 
individuals. She said she hopes the 
University improves its protocol 
in the future.
“From my personal experience, 
if there had been an incident it 
would have been very, very bad 
because of these communication 
breakdowns,” McLain said. “I’m 
a little disappointed because most 
of what I’ve seen out of these 
universities, this just proves their 
system doesn’t work and that 
concerns me. This should actually 
be a wake-up call that we’re not 
doing what we should be doing, 
and we should do everything we 
can to improve it.”

ALERT
From Page 1

She told a story about her 
own 
experience 
applying 
to the University — when 
someone from the Office of 
Financial Aid came to her 
high school, she asked a 
question about how she could 
receive aid with her DACA 
status. 
The 
representative 
told her he wasn’t sure what 
to do, and advised her to email 
the 
Financial 
Aid 
Office, 
something she had already 
done.
The 
second 
speaker, 
also a student member of 
SCOPE, 
discussed 
actions 
the organization has taken in 
previous years. According to 
the student, after the election 
of President Donald Trump 
and the increased uncertainty 
surrounding 
the 
Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
program, SCOPE issued a list 
of requests to the University.
The organization requested 
the 
University 
fully 
meet 
DACA 
students’ 
financial 
need, hire a staff member to 
serve as a primary contact for 
DACA students and increase 
access 
to 
information 
for 
prospective 
undocumented 
students, among other things.
Hector 
Galvan, 
who 
works as the Undocumented 
Student 
Program 
Manager 
in the Office of Academic 
Multicultural 
Initiatives, 
also 
spoke 
at 
the 
event. 
He explained his role — to 
advise 
undocumented 
and 
“DACAmented” students and 
collaborate 
across 
campus 
to 
serve 
these 
students. 
He 
also 
gave 
information 
about 
resources 
available 
to undocumented students, 
including 
Student 
Legal 
Services 
and 
a 
website 
specifically for undocumented 
students.
The last student member to 
speak discussed his experience 
as an undocumented transfer 
student at the University. He 
explained 
that 
University 
policy indicates a student 
must apply within 28 months 
of graduating high school, 
something he believes greatly 
affects 
undocumented 
students.
After 
spending 
49 
months 
working 
full-time 
and 
completing 
courses 
at 
a 
community 
college, 
Galvan 
was 
accepted 
as 
a transfer student to the 
University’s 
Taubman 
College of Architecture and 
Urban 
Planning. 
Though 
he 
completed 
a 
summer 
semester, his status as a 
student is unclear as his 
financial aid information is 

being reviewed. Galvan is 
currently attending all his 
classes in hopes of getting 
retrospective credit after he 
is granted financial aid and 
his enrollment is confirmed.
Natalia Ipince, a senior 
in Taubman and the School 
of 
Art 
& 
Design, 
is 
an 
international 
student 
from 
Venezuela 
who 
moved 
to 
the United States four years 
ago. She came to the event 
after realizing the different 
barriers 
undocumented 
students have to face.
“I 
realized 
that 
I 
was 
interested in the boundaries 
people 
have 
to 
cross,” 
Ipince said. “In this case, 
I ended up realizing that 
undocumented students have 
a lot of boundaries that they 
have to cross to g˜et the same 
education a lot of us do.”
Ipince 
also 
explained 
she 
sympathized 
with 
undocumented 
students 
after experiencing the legal 
challenges of the immigration 
system.
LSA 
junior 
Rosa 
Avilez 
also attended the event and 
spoke to The Daily about her 
own 
experience 
applying 
to 
the 
University 
as 
a 
“DACAmented” student.
“Originally, I really didn’t 
think I could apply to the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
because I really didn’t know 
about the opportunities it held 
for undocumented students,” 
Avilez said. “I instantly knew 
I wasn’t going to be able to 
get federal aid, I might not 
be able to apply for in-state 
tuition, so money was a really 
big issue.”
She said the University 
initially 
gave 
her 
a 
scholarship, but she wasn’t 
able to accept it because of 
her DACA status. However, 
she also received a similar, 
privately funded scholarship, 
allowing her to attend the 
University.
“That only happened after 
I filled out another in-state 
application,” she said. “As a 
DACA recipient, I am not a 
permanent resident. I am not 
a U.S. citizen.”
She also explained that 
she wished more students 
on 
campus 
knew 
about 
undocumented students and 
DACA recipients.
“All of us, we’re just really 
hard 
workers,” 
she 
said. 
“We really just want to go to 
college, and if I didn’t have 
the in-state tuition policy 
that was just implemented a 
few years ago, this would not 
be possible. I wouldn’t be here 
and I know a lot of us wouldn’t 
be here.”

T

he past few weeks have 
been quite a whirlwind in 
Middle East geopolitics. 
On Wednesday, reports from 
U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and 
Syria indicated that the Islamic 
State in the Levant had collapsed. 
On March 13, the Senate voted 
to end U.S. military aid to Saudi 
Arabia in its long, bloody conflict 
against the Houthi rebellion 
in Yemen. Last week, Michael 
Pompeo, U.S. secretary of state, 
visited Israel and met with Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
a move said to be an attempt to 
strengthen Netanyahu’s chances 
in the upcoming Israeli elections 
on April 9. For those who often 
find themselves engrossed in 
the current events of the never-
stagnant Middle East, March 
has been filled with notable 
occurrences.
Yet 
arguably 
the 
most 
significant news out of the region 
came Thursday, when President 
Donald Trump tweeted what has 
come to be considered an official 
recognition of Israel’s sovereignty 
over the Golan Heights. A formal 
motion came during Netanyahu’s 
visit to Washington, D.C. for 
meetings with Trump and his 
address to the American Israel 
Public Affairs Committee policy 
conference this week. A small 
plateau on the Israeli-Syrian 
border, this territory has been 
disputed for decades, beginning 
in the aftermath of the 1967 
Six-Day War between Israel, 
Egypt, Syria and Jordan. During 
the war, Israel conquered the 
Golan Heights in an effort to 
stop Syrian attacks on civilians 
in the Galilee region of northern 
Israel, and to assure that access 
to the freshwater of the Sea of 
Galilee and the Jordan River — 
then an overwhelming majority 
of Israel’s water supply — would 
remain unencumbered. These 
issues played a large role in the 
months leading up to the Six-Day 
War, and had caused problems in 
Israeli-Syrian relations for years.
In 
1981, 
Israel 
formally 
annexed 
the 
territory 
and 
applied its law there, much 
to the chagrin of most of the 
international community. There 
have 
been 
many 
attempts, 
including 
United 
Nations 
resolutions, to get Israel to 
leave the territory and return 
it to Syria in a potential future 
peace agreement. The status of 
the region has at times appeared 
so uncertain that much of the 
Druze 
population 
living 
in 
the Golan has attempted to 
maintain loyalty to Syria by 
publicly pledging support to 
President 
Bashar 
al-Assad. 
This comes from the fear that 
should Syria eventually regain 
control of the territory, they 
would be considered traitors. 
Foreign 
dignitaries, 
even 
Israeli 
allies, 
would 
rarely 
publicly acknowledge Israel’s 
authority over the land. All the 
while, Israel — in particular, 
Netanyahu — has consistently 
been adamant that for the 
purposes 
of 
domestic 
and 
regional security, the Golan 
must remain in Israeli hands.
For the last 50 years, Israel 
has transformed the area into 
a hub of culture, commerce 
and agriculture. The wineries 
in the Golan have produced 
some of the finest wines in the 
world. Fertile Golani farms are 
the origin of much of Israel’s 
dairy products. One peak, Mount 
Hermon, is the tallest point in 
Israel and the only place in the 
country where one can go skiing. 
There is a proud yet somber 

history 
there, 
as 
memorials 
from past wars and fields of 
abandoned bunkers and markers 
of undetonated landmines dot the 
landscape between the springing 
cities. In the years since 1967, 
the area has, for all intents and 
purposes, become truly Israeli. 
Its current residents are mostly 
Israeli civilians, and its land is 
under full control of the Jewish 
state. When one visits the Golan 
Heights, there does not appear 
to be any dispute at all about to 
whom it belongs.
Trump’s recognition of Israel’s 
control of the Golan is important 
and justified for a plethora of 
reasons. It is a move that is vital 
to the interests of both the U.S. 
and Israel, and advances regional 
security. Israel’s northeast border 
is an incredibly short distance 
from some of the hottest zones 
of extremism and conflict in the 
region. As a sign at the top of 
Mount Bental — a mountain on 
the Golan just inside the Israeli 

side of the demilitarized zone — 
indicates, the plateau rests just 
60 kilometers from Damascus. 
Geopolitical 
instability 
has 
brought a variety of threats 
to Israel’s doorstep. Stray fire 
from the Syrian civil war has 
sometimes 
entered 
Israeli 
territory, and the Israel Defense 
Forces have had to alleviate many 
potentially dangerous situations.
An 
even 
graver 
threat 
comes from Iranian-sponsored 
forces such as Hezbollah and 
the 
Islamic 
Revolutionary 
Guards Corps. Each has set 
up installations in Syria and 
Lebanon in recent years, training 
and recruiting fighters to join 
their extremist ranks. Sworn 
enemies of the Jewish state, these 
militias are dedicated to carrying 
out Tehran’s dream of Israel’s 
destruction. These groups have 
built a stockpile of thousands of 
long-range missiles, capable of 
striking nearly any place in the 
country. In its efforts to combat 
these attackers, Israel has relied 
heavily on the Golan Heights as 
a buffer zone between itself and 
Syria, home to numerous Iranian 
and Hezbollah military sites. 
Israel also uses the Golan to 
monitor its enemies’ movements 
in hopes of preventing future 
violence.
For the short- and long-
term security of both Israel 
and the region as a whole, it 
is imperative that Israel be 
allowed to maintain control of 
the Golan Heights. As Nikki 
Haley, former U.S. ambassador 
to the UN, recently expressed, 
“The Golan Heights are either 
Israeli 
or 
Syrian. 
America 
should never support giving an 
inch of territory to the barbaric 
war 
criminal 
Assad.” 
With 
Syrian control of the Golan, 
Bashar al-Assad, as well as the 
IRGC and Hezbollah, would 
be dangerously close. Just as it 
happened in 1967, these forces 
would be able to cut off the Sea 
of Galilee and the Jordan River, 
major sources of freshwater. 
This would not only harm Israel, 
but Jordan — also a U.S. ally 

and moderate state. Israel and 
Jordan share water as part of 
developing peace terms between 
the two countries, and cutting 
off the Jordan River could leave 
both states at risk of seeing 
their agreements collapse. Such 
consensus regarding water has 
also helped in relations between 
Israel 
and 
the 
Palestinian 
National 
Authority, 
whose 
people would also feel the heat 
of losing the river’s vital water 
supply.
In addition to the strategic 
benefits of keeping the Golan 
Heights under Israeli control, 
Trump’s 
recognition 
also 
serves to acknowledge what 
has been a fact on the ground 
for 52 years. Though past U.S. 
administrations have shirked 
away 
from 
recognizing 
the 
legitimacy of Israel’s control on 
the plateau, Trump has taken a 
truth-based, realistic approach. 
Given the seemingly permanent 
instability across the Syrian 
border and the history of the 
territory in regional conflicts, it 
would make no sense for Israel to 
cede control.
Critics 
of 
Trump’s 
recognition say that it damages 
prospects for peace between 
Israel and Syria, and that it only 
fuels tensions between the two 
countries. However, in light 
of the collapse of past efforts 
toward a potential reconciliation 
with the Syrian government, 
there is no incentive for Israel 
to give up the Golan in the 
foreseeable future. While the 
Syrian government has come out 
strongly against the recognition, 
it is unclear what the future of 
Syrian leadership will look like, 
and a government reliant on 
military support from Iran and 
Russia will surely not be the 
most trustworthy negotiation 
partner. The current and future 
costs are simply too high to hold 
out hope for a complete shift 
toward diplomacy from militant 
forces keen on a close ally’s 
destruction.
Trump’s 
foreign 
policy 
doctrine of “principled realism” 
has 
drawn 
great 
criticism 
by those who consider the 
approach 
brash, 
ideological 
and 
imbalanced. 
Yet 
the 
president’s decision to formally 
acknowledge 
and 
support 
Israel’s control over the Golan 
Heights is exactly the opposite. 
He has looked both to decades 
of history and the current 
climate as context and has 
balanced concerns of the one 
true democracy in the Middle 
East with actions that he deems 
best for security and prosperity 
of the entire region. Just as the 
president displayed in both his 
recognition of Jerusalem as 
Israel’s capital and his choice 
to move the U.S. embassy from 
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, he has 
approached the issue of the 
Golan Heights with careful 
moral, strategic and logical 
consideration.
This new clarity for the 
future 
brings 
an 
informed 
change to a situation that has 
essentially remained the same 
since the gunfire ceased on June 
10, 1967. No prior U.S. president 
has dared to step in and set the 
record straight on the reality of 
the Golan’s status. On this issue, 
as is the case in much of his 
foreign policy, Trump ironically 
appears to be the only adult in 
the room.

Trump’s “principled realism” pays dividends in the Golan Heights

The tyranny of Ann Arbor’s fast-casual architecture
I

f you haven’t noticed 
these 
buildings 
all 
across 
Ann 
Arbor, 
then you just haven’t been 
paying attention. Each and 
every one of the buildings 
follows almost the exact 
same design formula and 
they are clustered in two 
locations: 
just 
south 
of 
the Diag and just north of 
it. These buildings go by 
their “slick” and corporate 
market 
research 
names: 
Six11, ArborBlu, Landmark, 
Zaragon, Foundry, Varsity 
and YOUnion.
The similarities between 
the buildings is striking, to 
say the least. To start our 
exploration, let’s begin by 
examining the outsides. As 
I see it, all of the exteriors 
share three central design 
elements. First, they all have 
large, 
rectangular 
boxes 
as 
their 
core 
structure. 
These boxes are augmented 
to 
look 
more 
interesting 
and complex by creating a 
layering effect in which other 
boxes jut out of certain parts 
of the buildings. Second, the 
materials on the outsides are 
all the same: orange bricks, a 
heavy emphasis on windows 
and a prefabricated “Hardie” 
paneling that finds itself 
somewhere on the grayscale. 
Third, all of them have 
between 12 and 14 floors. It is 
worth noting that most — but 
not all — of these buildings 
are also designed with retail 
space on the first floor.
The 
interiors 
and 
marketing 
for 
these 
buildings 
are 
also 
very 
similar. All of the buildings 
advertise a large common 
space with pool tables, high 
ceilings and a new take on 
mid-century 
modernism 
in which dark grays are 
accented by bright colored 
furniture, 
usually 
orange 
or blue. The floor plans of 
all the buildings are nearly 
the same with the kitchen 
next to the door, followed 
by the living room and then 
bedrooms off to the sides. 
Many advertise an industrial 
look to the buildings with 
exposed 
concrete 
ceilings 
— an easy way to cut costs 
while also seeming stylish 
and edgy.
The marketing in all of the 
websites is centered around 
selling a “luxury” student 
experience 
in 
which 
all 
aspects of the ideal student 
life can be achieved — a 
nexus of party life, studying, 
commercial 
convenience 
and exercise. Many of these 
buildings market themselves 
by selling a lifestyle, a “fam” 
or a community. Finally, 
most of the websites have 
a tab for parents and the 
concerns they will have for 
their child’s life in luxury 
apartments.
For many people in Ann 
Arbor, 
these 
developer 
modernist 
buildings 
have 
become 
a 
symbol 
of 
gentrification 
and 
the 
ongoing 
housing 
affordability 
crisis. 
In 
many ways, this question of 

gentrification and developer 
modernism was the central 
question of Prop A in this 
past year’s city election. The 
proposition proposed making 
the city’s library parking lot 
into an urban park as a way 
of blocking a new luxury 
housing development. The 
“Collective on 5th” would 
have fit seamlessly into the 
previously mentioned luxury 
apartments except for the 
fact that it would have been 
even more fancy.
The people of Ann Arbor 
voted 
“Yes” 
on 
Prop 
A, 
blocking the construction of 
the Collective on 5th, and 
making a loud statement 
about what people in Ann 
Arbor have come to see 
as 
gentrification. 
While 
there are interesting and 
complicated 
questions 
swirling around Ann Arbor’s 

housing debate, it is clear 
that these luxury apartments 
are designed with exclusivity 
in mind (generally speaking, 
rent is more than $1,000 in 
these buildings).
All 
of 
these 
developer 
modernist buildings in Ann 
Arbor got me thinking about 
the larger trend of these 
buildings popping up all 
across the U.S. in roughly the 
past five years. What exactly 
are these buildings? What do 
we want to call the buildings? 
Do we like how they look? 
What kind of impact do they 
have on the surrounding 
communities? Why are so 
many of them being built? 
And, just generally, what 
should we make of them?
The first term — and 
my preferred term — that 
I heard to describe these 
buildings, 
was 
“developer 
modernism.” In 2017, a series 
of memes swept the internet 
mocking 
and 
criticizing 
these buildings. Many of the 
memes, and their supporting 
critics, 
were 
just 
simply 
calling the buildings boring 
and ugly. Others, however, 
also saw the buildings as a 
sign of gentrification.
Kriston 
Capps, 
an 
architecture 
journalist, 
pointed out a deep state of 
irony in one of these memes. 
One building featured in a 
viral meme as an image of 
gentrification was actually 
affordable and low-income 
housing — it was just built 
in the developer modernist 
architecture 
style. 
Capps 
has been shown over and 
over again to be a supporter 
of these buildings, and calls 
them by his preferred term: 
fast-casual architecture.
His arguments in favor 

of the buildings are fairly 
simple: They are cheap to 
build, not every building 
needs 
to 
“dominate 
the 
view” and they are nice-
enough looking. Capps sees 
it comparable to eating at 
a 
fast-casual 
restaurant. 
The food won’t blow you 
away, but it’s convenient, 
fairly cheap and fairly good. 
What’s to complain about?
Kate Wagner, creator of 
the hit architectural blog 
“McMansion Hell,” adds to 
Capps’ argument by pointing 
out that internet critics and 
meme creators have engaged 
in form of what she calls 
“Aesthetic moralism” — the 
belief that one aesthetic is 
inherently better or more 
righteous 
than 
another. 
Wagner says that the left 
has 
weakened 
itself 
by 
becoming more invested in 
aesthetics and traditionalist 
architecture which comes at 
the cost of actually finding 
ways 
to 
make 
housing 
affordable. 
Unlike 
Capps, 
Wagner does point out that, 
oftentimes, buildings in the 
fast-casual style are luxury 
buildings. Wagner notes that 
the main difference between 
the 
luxury 
and 
more 
affordable buildings are the 
interiors.
From all the research I 
have done, this argument 
seems to be true that the 
developer modernist style 
is one of the cheapest ways 
to 
build 
and 
that 
there 
are a plethora of examples 
of affordable and mixed-
income housing being built 
in 
this 
style. 
Developer 
modernism is cheap for a 
number of reasons.
For starters, the insides 
of the buildings are usually 
cookie cutter, which cuts 
down on design costs. Also, 
the buildings tend to fit very 
well within city codes, which 
cuts 
down 
development 
delays. 
Furthermore, 
“Hardie” panels and bricks 
are two of the cheapest 
materials to build a facade 
out of, hence the mixture of 
the two.
So, what’s to be made of 
all this? On the one hand, it 
is clear that the developer 
modernist 
apartments 
in 
Ann Arbor are not affordable 
and largely seen as images 
of gentrification. On the 
other hand, we see that this 
architectural style is one of 
the cheapest ways to build 
and can be used to effectively 
make low-income housing.
The takeaway is this: For 
people in Ann Arbor, like 
myself, who view developer 
modernism as a sign of a 
gentrification, take a second 
to refrain from aesthetic 
moralism 
when 
you 
see 
developer 
modernism 
in 
other 
cities. 
The 
powers 
of 
developer 
modernism 
can be used on much more 
noble projects than the next 
Zaragon Place.

Since its creation, MUSIC 
Matters 
has 
brought 
an 
unbelievable array of big-name 
artists to campus, including J. 
Cole, Lil Yachty, Ben Folds, 2 
Chainz, Migos and Louis The 
Child. In typical fashion, this 
year’s SpringFest 2019 brings 
the mighty A$AP Ferg 
to 
the 
University’s 
Hill Auditorium on 
Apr. 16 as a part of the 
organization’s annual 
lifestyle festival a la 
SXSW. 
SpringFest, 
the 
largest 
student-run 
event on campus, is 
an 
all-day 
festival 
and nighttime benefit 
concert. 
By 
day, 
attendees can enjoy 
showcase work from 
over 65 other student 
organizations, 
providing numerous 
opportunities 
for 
demonstration 
and 
exploration 
of 
the 
student 
life 
that 
makes the University 
unique. In addition, 
SpringFest 
features 
an outlet for student 
start-ups 
and 
businesses to display 
their work to a wider 
audience. By night, attendees 
can experience an intimate, 
Michigan-only concert in Hill 
Auditorium. 
Typically, 
Hill 
features 
orchestras 
and 
theatrical 
performances, 
but 
MUSIC 
Matters is breaking the mold 
with an unprecedented rap 
concert from one of the most 
iconic names in hip hop today. 
A$AP Ferg gained notoriety 
with the rest of the A$AP 
Mob on the coattails of A$AP 
Rocky. 
(There 
are 
many 
A$APs.) 
A 
coalition 
from 

Harlem, the Mob ushered in 
a new combination of hard-
hitting New York gangster rap 
and boomy Southern trap that 
quite literally took the hip-hop 
world by storm. While Rocky 
is certainly the poster child 
of the group, Ferg is a close 
second, developing a personal 
a sound that is particularly 
more aggressive than that 
of the Mob or its pretty-boy 
leader. 
Since 2013, Ferg has released 
two albums, Trap Lord and 
Always Strive and Prosper, and 
one mixtape, Still Striving. In 

2013, he was crowned Rookie 
of The Year for his single 
“Shabba” at the BET Music 
Awards. With a discography 
full of party-made bangers, 
Ferg is primed to deliver a 
tasty trap treat dipped in 808s 
and 
jocularly 
intimidating 
one-liners to SpringFest 2019.
“My goal is to create the best 
possible concert experience 
for 
the 
Michigan 
student 
body,” Talent and Concert 
Chair Marty Hubbard said. 
“A$AP Ferg as our SpringFest 
2019 headliner lives up to 

that.”
On top of a day stage, food 
trucks 
and 
pop-up 
shops, 
SpringFest is also continuing 
its CoMMunity Partnership 
initiative, which provides a 
grant for philanthropic student 
ventures at the University. For 
this year’s SpringFest, MUSIC 
Matters joined with Heal-
Move-Shift 
and 
Michigan 
Movement 
to 
encourage 
educational accessibility for 
underprivileged students. A 
variety of projects funded 
by these initiatives will be 
showcased this year. 
MUSIC 
Matters 
Social Venture Chair 
Katie 
Schwartz 
said, 
“We 
are 
so 
thankful to have the 
opportunity to share 
in 
and 
contribute 
to 
their 
respective 
impactful 
efforts, 
from 
facilitating 
local 
high 
school 
seminars about the 
positive relationship 
of music and mental 
health 
with 
Heal-
Move-Shift 
to 
lending 
a 
helping 
hand to the homeless 
population 
of 
Ann 
Arbor with Michigan 
Movement.” 
Part 
of 
the 
SpringFest 
proceeds 
will 
be 
used to support and 
grow the CoMMunity 
Partnership initiative 
further.
The 
festival’s 
social 
initiatives 
extend to all aspects, ranging 
from emphases on community 
outreach 
to 
zero 
waste. 
SpringFest 2019’s full daytime 
schedule is still to come.
Tickets for the show at Hill 
are on sale now, starting at $15 
for students with valid UMID 
and $25 for the general public. 
They are available at the 
Michigan Union Ticket Office, 
which is located underground 
at the Michigan League during 
the Union’s renovation, or at 
the official MUSIC Matters 
website.

It’s not hard to imagine how 
strange the reunion of American 
Football must have been for its 
members. Their 1997 self-titled 
album, which was recorded when 
the band was in their last year of 
college in Urbana, combined earnest 
energy and understated wistfulness 
in a style that has been often 
imitated. Among a certain group of 
people it’s become a sort of avatar 
for the fleeting, muddled feelings 
of youth and early adulthood. Its 
influence 
can’t 
be 
overstated, 
and rightly so — 
the album found 
a sweet spot in 
between 
the 
various currents of 
music at the time 
that has proven a 
fruitful jumping-
off point for an 
entire generation 
of musicians.
When 
American 
Football 
re-formed 
in 2014, the members of the 
group were pushing 40, and the 
band accordingly had the task 
of fitting their diaristic material 
into something that benefits their 
status as the elders of emo, with 
other musical projects, careers 
and families behind them. Their 
2016 album (also self-titled) was 
accordingly a little awkward even as 
it was more technically proficient, 
reflecting nearly two decades of 
experience. LP2 frequently felt as 
though the group was trying to 
transpose the malaise of middle 
age to the “see-through” teenage 

angst that their debut leans on. For 
anyone not familiar with vocalist 
Mike Kinsella’s solo project Owen, 
it’s almost strange to hear him sing 
“Oh how I wish that I were me / The 
man that you first met and married” 
with that same naive cadence. 
LP2 is also a little more sonically 
conventional. It retains some of 
the irregular time signatures and 
bendy, vocal guitar playing that 
added a crucial third dimension 
to LP1, but more often than not it 
settles into a regular groove.
The group’s third (again self-
titled) album clears out the band’s 
old sound pretty much altogether, 

replacing it with a saturated, 
effervescent 
style 
closer 
to 
shoegaze or post-rock. From the 
opening cascade of glockenspiel 
and vibraphone on “Silhouettes,” 
it’s clear the band is working with 
new materials — there’s an almost 
orchestral grandeur to the album, 
a panoramic sweep wholly separate 
from the stripped-down sound 
more familiar to the band. The 
recently-added bassist and multi-
instrumentalist 
Nate 
Kinsella 
(cousin of the vocalist) adds several 
new tone colors, including mallet 
percussion, a 12-string guitar and 
a Mellotron. There’s much more 

fine-tuned detail and several levels 
of distance to play with. American 
Football was heretofore defined by a 
certain economy of means, and LP3 
feels like the first time the group has 
seriously experimented with new 
instruments, relegating the guitar 
duet to one element among many.
These songs are also much 
broader in scope than anything 
the band has ever done before. 
“Silhouettes” and “Doom In Full 
Bloom” are both nearly eight 
minutes long, and most of the other 
songs hover around five and six 
minutes. If we were dealing with 
the kind of awkwardly self-pitying 
lyrics on LP2, this 
could be tiresome 
— but Kinsella’s 
lyricism has, for 
the 
first 
time, 
a 
sophisticated 
elegance to it. It’s 
still 
as 
earnest 
as we’re used to, 
but without the 
starkness of LP2.
It’s still possible 
to hear some of the 
qualities of LP1 in 
LP3 — the intertwining guitars in 
“Every Wave” and “Mine To Miss,” 
Kinsella’s charming short vocal 
phrases — but I somehow doubt 
that someone finding American 
Football via LP3 would understand 
the exuberant energy of the band’s 
first iteration. For all its power, LP3 
is pretty obvious and even veers 
toward filmic at times — it doesn’t 
have any of the inscrutability and the 
“wait, what was that?” quality that 
made LP1 so great. LP3 is mature 
and settled without repeating itself, 
but it invites speculation about what 
the band might have done had they 
not had to bridge a 15-year gap.

This summer, I’ll be taking the 
LSAT and applying to law schools. 
Somewhere over the course of the 
next two years, I’ll likely be moving 
out of my home state of Michigan for 
the first (official) time to attend law 
school. For some reason, I’m more 
excited than nervous about all of 
these things. My decision to go into 
law is not for the status or for the 
money, like many assume, but for 
the opportunity to serve and defend 
marginalized voices, to work on our 
prison system and, optimistically, to 
do my part in making our country 
what I know it can be.
You’ll hate law school, my family 
and well-meaning friends say. You 
know you’re going to be working 70 
hours a week. I wonder, though, if 
they’d think differently if I was a 
man. Men are cut out for hard work, 
for long hours, for doing whatever 
it takes to “provide.” Women, 
apparently, are not.
When I think about law school, 
I think about the hell that Dr. 
Christine Blasey-Ford has been 
living in since the Kavanaugh 
hearing, while her abuser sits on the 
Supreme Court and accepts visiting 
positions at law schools. I wonder 
if someone like him will be my 
professor. I think about President 
Trump’s 
continued 
accusations 
against and slandering of Hillary 
Clinton almost three years after the 
election has ended. I think of how 
the President can be excused for 
what seems like anything, while a 

small misstep by a female politician 
amounts to an explosion of criticism 
and dire threats to their careers. 
Congresswoman 
Ocasio-Cortez 
paid more of a consequence for 
dancing in college than Trump did 
for openly boasting about his tactics 
for sexual assault. I think about how 
the female candidates in the next 
election cycle will almost positively 
be treated the same — What is 
she wearing? Shouldn’t she be a 
mother? Won’t she be too moody and 
unpredictable to serve our country?
Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister 
of New Zealand, mourned with 
her country after the Christchurch 
attack less than two weeks ago. Six 
days later, Ardern announced that 
all military-style semiautomatic 
weapons 
and 
ammunition 
magazines that can be modified 
into these types of weapons will 
be nationally banned. Our U.S. 
government offered only thoughts 
and prayers for victims of countless 
mass shootings in our country; I was 
going to list some here, but there 
are too many. Ardern, a woman, 
proved more fit to serve her people 
after one instance of hate and 
violence than our current and past 
administrations have in hundreds 
of opportunities to do the same.
I’m conscious of my gender when 
I call myself a writer, too. I once said 
this at a party and was asked, Oh, so 
what do you write? You journal and 
stuff, right? I quickly learned that 
men are also valiant for choosing 
a creative field over a professional 
one — their work is important, 
profound, 
world-changing 
— 
while women are simply wasting 
their time. Women writers have 

historically been written off as 
“emotional” or “melodramatic.” 
Male writers — Ernest Hemingway, 
J.D. Salinger, David Foster Wallace 
— have been hailed as literary 
icons for years, if not decades. I’ve 
never been in a writing workshop 
where David Foster Wallace has not 
been brought up and subsequently 
praised. I always sit silently, letting 
the 
discussion 
progress 
into 
something like worship. In my head, 
I wonder if we will ever talk about 
his abuse toward Mary Karr — a 
brilliant writer, perhaps even more 
brilliant than Wallace himself. I 
wonder if we’ll ever talk about 
Hemingway’s alcoholism and bar 
fights in a way that isn’t glamorous, 
or Salinger’s abusive relationship 
with Joyce Maynard when she was 
only 18 and he was 53, which she 
has been ostracized and blamed 
for for almost 50 years. I’ve had 
men who’ve never taken a creative 
nonfiction class, or even read a 
memoir for that matter, explain to 
me how to master the art of creative 
nonfiction, even after I’d told them 
that I’m a creative nonfiction writer 
with countless workshops and 
essays and memoirs under my belt.
We should look to Ardern for 
example. We should look to our 
female writers, lawyers, politicians, 
teachers and mothers’ examples. 
We ignore women doing hard and 
just work simply because they 
are women. If we allow women 
of all races, demographics and 
professions the space to step out of 
the shadow of men, maybe we’ll find 
the change we’re looking for — and 
the change that we need.

Women push us forward

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Comedian 
Amy 
Schumer 
(“I 
Feel 
Pretty”) 
returns 
to stand-up with a run-of-
the-mill performance in her 
latest Netflix comedy special 
“Growing,” shot in Chicago. 
Unlike the majority of other 
comedy specials, the camera 
never panned to the reactions 
of 
any 
audience 
members, 
instead 
holding 
the 
focus 
on 
Schumer 
for 
its 
entirety. 
Similar 
to 
comedian 
Ali 
Wong’s 
Netflix 
comedy 
specials, 
Schumer performs 
this special while 
heavily 
pregnant 
(about 
five 
months 
along), 
resulting in more 
trite jokes about 
pregnancy 
than 
a non-pregnant person can 
handle. She reveals that she 
has suffered from hyperemesis 
throughout 
her 
pregnancy, 
which 
for 
her, 
manifested 
itself in the form of constant 
vomiting and nausea.
These vivid jokes that she 
makes about her pregnancy and 
its symptoms are lackluster at 
best and end up sounding more 
like sporadic rants rather than 
segues into her other bits. Her 
typical off-color toilet humor 
takes no breaks throughout the 
special, especially prevalent 
when she talks about her 
struggles with pregnancy. To 
her credit, she keeps it candid 

about the physical hardships 
she’s endured with pregnancy, 
but this kind of content is 
only relatable for someone 
who’s experienced a difficult 
pregnancy as well. 
Although Schumer’s style 
of humor has always been 
relatable for only a specific 
demographic, in “Growing,” 
her 
humor 
is 
even 
too 
fragmented to appeal to her 
base in full. 
For the first half of the 

special, 
Schumer 
only 
made 
brief 
passes 
at 
her 
political 
stances, 
but 
her 
casual demeanor completely 
diminished as she talked about 
politics at full force toward 
the second half of the special. 
She begins by sarcastically 
referring to her future child: 
“I don’t know what I’m having. 
I hope it’s a girl. But really 
just because it’s such a scary 
time for men.” From there, the 
progression of her political 
commentary only increased. 
She mentions the time she got 
arrested in Washington, D.C. 
for a protest against Brett 
Kavanaugh’s appointment to 

the Supreme Court, saying, 
“Men, you can clap too” when 
the audience burst out in 
applause. 
For the first time, Schumer 
discloses information about 
her husband Chris Fischer 
and his diagnosis with Autism 
Spectrum 
Disorder. 
She 
introduces 
the 
topic 
with 
sincerity and genuine love 
for her husband and their 
relationship. Schumer’s open 
expression of appreciation for 
Fischer is evident 
in the tact and care 
clearly put into the 
jokes, which reflect 
on 
her 
personal 
experiences 
with 
her 
husband 
rather than offend 
those 
who 
live 
with the disorder. 
Her stories about 
her husband are 
refreshing 
and 
easily 
the 
most 
entertaining 
part 
of the comedy special. They 
display her transition from 
a comedian who only makes 
empty jokes about sex and 
food to a comedian who draws 
stories from a more mature 
place. 
Schumer has always been 
very straightforward with her 
views, as many comedians are, 
which is why people find her 
off-putting. But if her comedy 
continues to expand from her 
constant quips about being 
a single woman to what she 
gave us a brief sample of in 
“Growing,” she might be able 
to find a more loyal and niche 
audience to support her. 

Schumer grows herself, if 
only a little, with ‘Growing’

TV REVIEW

NETFLIX

Growing

Netflix

Now streaming

Let’s get this out of the way: 
I’m a poser of a Senior Arts 
Editor for the Book Review. 
I applied to Daily Arts with 
music and film as my top 
preferred beats, but I was 
sorted into books (the reason 
for which was that I was one 
of only two people in that fall 
semester round of applicants 
who had even a mere mention 
of books somewhere on their 
application). I didn’t know any 
upcoming books to request for 
review copies, choosing new 
books to review at Sunday 
meetings made me anxious and 
when it came time to submit 
blurbs for end-of-the-year lists, 
I had nothing because I had 
only read two books that were 
published in 2017, and they 
weren’t that great.
A year passes, and although 
my confidence grows slightly, 
I still have the same anxieties 
about my ability to be a 
confident books writer. I found 
myself recently hired as the top 
books brass and it’s now my 
turn to help coordinate end-of-
the-year lists. I still had nothing 
to 
write 
about 
for 
blurbs 
because the few books I read 
over the year still weren’t that 
great. For the more personal 
end-of-the-year retrospective 
we published, I sealed my 
resolution in ink to attack my 
books backlog methodically. 
But, surprise surprise, it’s still 
as clogged as it was four months 
ago, except it’s only partly from 
my laziness. There’s a new 
obsession stacked ever-high on 
that Bed Bath & Beyond cart of 
mine: graphic novels.
***
Cut back to mid-December 
darkness 
— 
my 
editor-in-
crime, Verity Sturm, wants me 
to write a blurb for our Top 10 
list, despite my having read 
nothing worth blurbing. We 
had sent out a Google Form to 
all our writers earlier polling 
their best books of the year, 
and Verity was hard at work 
collecting all these responses 
and creating a cohesive and 
unanimous 
ranking. 
One 
afternoon, as I was piddling my 
winter break away, she sends 
me a PowerPoint presentation 
of the 10 books she wants on 
the list, unranked. We start 
assigning blurbs based on who’s 
read what. We can only assign 
so much, and three blurbs go 
unclaimed — Verity, the saint 
she is, offers to do all of them.
Of course, I won’t let her 
take this much work on herself, 
so I offer to take any one of the 
books off her hands. A lightbulb 
must’ve turned on in her head, 
because Verity told me to take 
“The Pervert,” supplying a 
glowing recommendation to go 
with it. I look it up on the ol’ 
information superhighway and 
find terse synopses: The back 
cover reads, “A surprisingly 
honest and touching account of 
a trans girl surviving through 
sex work in Seattle.” Oh. OH. 
I scurry down to the nearest 
Barnes & Noble and buy the 
damn thing.
At this point in my life I’ve 
only come out to a handful of 
friends and my mom that I’m 
transgender. I make steps like 
buying new clothes or changing 
my email accounts, but I still 
get called my deadname by 
people that don’t know better 
and even sometimes by people 
that do. You would have to pay 
a random stranger a million 
dollars to refer to me as “she” 
or “her,” apparently. It is 
suffocating.
***
In 
my 
Spanish 
Gender, 
Sexuality and Culture class 
the other day we learned 
of 
a 
Peruvian 
artist 
and 
travesti (roughly translated, 
it 
means 
crossdresser, 
but 
it conveys so much more) 
who was once photographed 
vested in garb reminiscent 
of Latinx depictions of the 
Virgin 
Mary. 
His 
costume 
bears a jeweled heart pierced 

with seven swords. To co-opt 
some religious imagery (and 
I mean, after being shunned 
by most religious members of 
my family, I deserve it), that is 
how I felt every day, except the 
swords piercing my heart were 
invisible. Yet they hurt all the 
same.
While only understanding, 
acceptance and time can pull 
those knives from my heart, 
sitting down to finally read 
“The Pervert” (after it sat 
intimidatingly on my desk for 
a few days) was a well-needed 
reminder that among trans 
people, this pain is universal. 
We may differ in the number 
of swords impaling nuestrxs 
corazones, or how deep they are 
driven, but we are stabbed all 
the same. We transfix others as 
we are transfixed ourselves.
My 
first 
read 
through, 
I tried to accompany “The 
Pervert” with music. It has a 
certain grunge vibe to it, being 
in Seattle and all, so I put on 
Sonic Youth’s sprawling opus 
Daydream Nation with hopes 
it would match the graphic 
novel beat for beat. (And to 
those about to complain in the 
comments, “B-But Sonic Youth 
isn’t grunge,” don’t, I don’t 
care.) “The Pervert” oscillates 
in moods and content as freely 
as Daydream Nation does, but 
its stream of consciousness 
was 
inexplicably 
clashing 
with the music. The only 
song that fit, funnily enough, 
was “Providence,” a sparse 
interlude with no lyrics, only 
a voicemail from a man named 
Watt asking frontman Thurston 
Moore if “(he) found (his) shit.”
Like 
“Providence,” 
“The 
Pervert” 
is 
something 
surprisingly beautiful, a whole 
greater than the sum of its 
parts. It’s ghastly, but also 
serene and undeniably funny. 
It’s 
a 
raunchy 
throwaway 
voicemail achieving a loving 
melody. It’s the beautiful piano 
paired with the ugly sound of 
an amplifier frying out.
***
I don’t want to go into plot 
details of the graphic novel 
because the point of “The 
Pervert” isn’t the plot. It’s the 
experience it conveys, and the 
specificities of that experience 
sketched to strike a chord 
with people like me. Even 
though I am not a sex worker, 
the reality undercutting trans 
sex work — that of it being an 
object filtered through the 
heterosexual, cisgender male 
gaze — is intimately familiar 
to all of us. There are multiple 
wordless moments where the 
main character is afraid and 
ashamed to live in her own 
skin: It hit me blindsided, like 
a blurry truck driving down a 
rainy highway. It’s strangely 
personal for me, even ending in 
Michigan of all places.
As I mentioned in my Top 
10 blurb, the watercolors are 
perfect and they are so, so 
goddamn real. The illustrations 
of 
“The 
Pervert” 
are 
not 
forcefully tailored for any gaze. 
There’s a wonderfully explicit 
two-page spread with no words, 
only twelve squares displaying 
the varying dimensions of trans 
sex. I got incredibly defensive 
when my mom approached 
me about the copy sitting in 
my room, as she had flipped 
through it earlier in the day 
only to tell me I was practically 
reading porn. However fuming, 
I 
quickly 
dismissed 
the 
argument and gave up because 
I knew she could never fully 
get it. I think this anger came 
from me unfairly and suddenly 
being forced not only to defend 
this “porn,” but to defend the 
reality of trans bodies, MY 
body, from heteronormative 
distortion. We exist and that’s 
not wrong.
All 
the 
characters 
are 
cartoonish 
animals, 
so 
unfortunately the uncensored 
sex scenes might remind you 
of frightening furry Rule 34, 
but 
their 
human 
qualities 
remain the most important. 
In a certain way, that’s the 
trans experience, appearing 
as human but other people 

seeing you as a totally different 
species.
If you’re not trans, you will 
probably find “The Pervert” 
confusing 
or 
not 
easily 
understandable but that’s okay 
because 
the 
graphic 
novel 
isn’t exclusionary. It’s not just 
“for trans eyes only.” Reading 
it does not mean immediate 
allyship, but it illustrates a 
certain 
unseen 
dimension 
of the trans experience that 
cisgender people almost never 
know because they will never 
feel it. Simply read it, then turn 
inward instead of demanding 
elaboration 
on 
the 
more 
nuanced panels.
For one of my personal essays 
for an English class this year, I 
wrote about the formation of 
my trans experience through 
a few specific anecdotes, and 
I feel like a plagiarizing hack 
that I did this, but I ended 
my paper with a scene ripped 
straight from “The Pervert,” 
because it has happened to me 
almost 
word-for-word 
more 
than once. I wrote it like this:
“Is that all, sir?” says the 
cashier behind the counter, the 
rehearsed response to my order.
Oh God, I hope so.
I felt this a thematic cap 
to all the anecdotes in my 
essay (which were connected 
through the common theme of 
pain), but I got a comment back 
from my professor saying the 
short vignette was unclear and 
the reader wouldn’t know what 
I was referring to. While I don’t 
want to whine that this was 
an unjust comment because 
it makes sense in the context 
of a workshop-heavy class, I 
took this one personally, just 
like my mom’s comment about 
“The Pervert.” Again I felt 
this necessity to defend it and 
defend myself, asserting that 
I don’t have to make sense for 
you — fuck making it easy for 
the reader. But I let the anger 
blow through me, and I let it go.
***
Returning to the Top 10 
blurb for the nteenth time, 
after I submitted it to Verity 
for editing purposes, she was 
jazzed about it, but also worried 
that 
my 
explosive 
rhetoric 
could backfire on myself. I 
wasn’t ready to come out to the 
wider world, and publishing 
this would maybe thrust me 
into that process unhealthily. 
I took her concerns to heart 
and 
considered 
taking 
my 
tongue down a notch, but after 
some deliberating I told her to 
publish it as is. Even if it outed 
me, like “The Pervert,” I was 
unapologetic in saying what 
I wanted to say. Retooling my 
short blurb would be violence 
to myself, like Remy Boydell 
and Michelle Perez trying to 
remake “The Pervert” for a PG 
audience.
I think deciding to publish 
that blurb was one of the 
first times where I started to 
prioritize my own comfort 
rather 
than 
stress 
about 
whether 
other 
people 
are 
comfortable with me or not. 
And fuck you if you aren’t. 
“The Pervert” left an indelible 
mark on my soul in the form 
of a watercolor . It opened the 
gates for me to further dive into 
the world of graphic novels, 
especially 
the 
challenging, 
weird and queer ones. After 
fangirling with Verity about 
“The Pervert” and my newfound 
love for visual literature, we 
decided to capitalize on not 
only my enthusiasm, but the 
found enthusiasm of many 
other Daily Arts writers.
Graphic Content, the series 
that this piece is launching, is 
the product of that enthusiasm. 
Credits to the ever-lovely Verity 
for the name. It’s a celebration 
of going against the grain and 
rejecting the literary tradition 
for the purpose of innovation, 
personal 
and 
universal. 
I 
hope it to be as irreverent and 
wonderful as the works we 
plan to cover. Keep an eye out 
for more Graphic Content every 
Tuesday for the rest of this 
semester. Until then, to thine 
own self be true. This, above 
all.

Tuesday, March 26, 2019 — 7

W

hen Alex Sobczak 
launched a three-run 
blast in the Wolver-
ines’ home-opener, the senior first 
baseman 
exchanged 
words with 
Michigan 
softball 
coach Carol 
Hutchins 
while round-
ing third base.
“It’s about 
time you 
swung,” 
Hutchins 
recalled telling her as she trotted 
home. “With runners on base in 
that RBI spot, we want to put the 
bat on the ball.”
Through the first month of 
the season, the Wolverines have 
searched every nook and cranny of 
the country for such swings.
Despite their efforts from 
Tampa, Fla. to Tempe, Ariz, Michi-
gan returned from each road trip 
without a season-altering revela-
tion at the plate. With multiple 
slap-hitters in the lineup, the team 
primarily relied on small ball to 
manufacture runs in its five weeks 
away from Ann Arbor.
For much of those five weeks, 
power was hard to come by. Home 
runs came few and far between — 

in 22 games, the team slugged just 
seven.
But when Michigan took the 
diamond at Alumni Field last week, 
the switch flipped. In the seven 
home games since, the Wolverines 
have launched 12 long balls en 
route to seven consecutive victo-
ries. With Michigan’s newfound 
power, those margins were no 
coincidence.
Senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield homered off the left-field 
flagpole in the team’s first home at-
bat, paving the way for her team-
mates to follow. Since Canfield’s 
long ball, each one of the team’s 
regulars — with the exception of 
slap-hitting sophomore shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez — has gone 
yard.
Yes, the influx of home runs 
has come against weaker pitching 
staffs than the Wolverines saw 
in their previous non-conference 
slate. But the fact that eight of 
Hutchins’ regulars flexed pop in 
their bat over a stretch of just seven 
games suggests it isn’t a fluke.
“(Home runs) mean we’re 
swinging with better confidence,” 
Hutchins said. “If there’s anything 
that’s improved, it’s our presence 
and our confidence. We’ve been a 
talented team all along, but now 
we’re playing with the confidence 
we need.”

This may be a hot streak, but 
it could be a permanent change. 
Michigan has added a new dimen-
sion to its offense. The team’s 
recent slugging torrid is rooted in a 
roster-wide mindset change at the 
plate, not a dozen fly balls that just 
caught a gust of wind. Hutchins 
has said such things, mind you.
In 2017 and 2018, the Wolver-
ines also had power surges that 
looked sustainable — only to fade 
away in the heat of the schedule.
Since the graduation of Sierra 
Romero and Sierra Lawrence in 
2016, power hitting has seemingly 
eluded the program’s offensive 
arsenal. The duo combined for 30 
home runs that season, but only 
one player has recorded more than 
nine in a season since.
As a team, Michigan amassed 
84 home runs in 2016. In the two 
seasons since, their respective 
totals of 44 and 54 have fallen well 
short. Entering last week’s homes-
tand, this year’s group was on pace 
for just 23 homers.
“Obviously when Sierra Romero 
and Sierra Lawrence stepped out, 
we became more of a consistency 
team than a power hitting team,” 
junior third baseman Madison 
Uden told The Daily at a preseason 
media availability on Feb. 5. “We’re 
not so much of a power hitting 
team, but who says you can’t get 

the job done with consistency?”
That approach didn’t work, to 
say the least, mostly because the 
Wolverines struggled to achieve 
consistency. They mustered a lack-
luster 3.59 runs per game in their 
22 road contests — including an 
uninspiring 16 total runs in eight 
games against ranked opponents — 
before last week’s turnaround.
After a two-year hiatus from 
mashing long balls, Michigan has 
returned to its old ways. The same 
old ways propelled it to a No. 2 
national ranking. The same old 
ways made Romero the clear-cut 
favorite for National Player of the 
Year honors in 2016. The same old 
ways made the program an annual 
staple in the Women’s College 
World Series.
This year’s Big Ten race is shap-
ing up to be the tightest in recent 
memory. Indiana, Minnesota, 
Wisconsin and Northwestern all 
pose formidable threats to the 
Wolverines, who have won 10 of 
the last 11 regular season titles. 
With three conference foes ranked 
ahead of them in the national poll, 
adding another championship to 
that historic run looks like it may 
be an uphill battle.
But after seeing the team’s rein-
vigorated approach at the plate, 
Michigan has itself an offensive 
revival, consistent pitching and 
coaching brain trust — a trio of 
advantages that could make that 
climb manageable.
If this team was going to have 
a kryptonite, it was going to be its 
lack of power on offense. But after 
watching the Wolverines plate 
an astronomical 64 runs in seven 
games, one thing has become cer-
tain: Michigan’s key to winning 
the conference once again lies in 
its power, something the rest of the 
nation thought it left in the past.
“I love home runs,” Hutchins 
said. “They’re like a 3-point shot 
in basketball — it’s a nice thing to 
have in your back pocket.”
It was about time Sobczak and 
her teammates swung as such.

Nemitz solidifies her presence

Mackenzie Nemitz started 
her birthday well.
Walking up to the booming 
guitar 
solo 
from 
Queen’s 
“Bohemian 
Rhapsody” 
with 
the momentum of her team’s 
4-0 
home-field 
lead behind her 
Sunday, Nemitz 
started 
her 
at-bat by taking 
two high balls. 
She 
stepped 
back, readjusted 
her 
grip 
and 
lifted her bat for 
the third time. 
A moment went 
by. And then the 
pitch.
Nemitz struck the ball, and it 
flew.
It was the senior infielder’s 
second 
home 
run 
of 
her 
Michigan career.
The afternoon before, on 
Michigan softball’s “Mackenzie 
Nemitz Day,” Nemitz hit a 
soaring home run past the right 
field wall at Alumni Field. The 
blast, with an RBI groundout 
single in the fourth inning, 
topped Nemitz’s total statistical 
performance at the plate this 

season. But it meant more than 
that.
“I was wrapping third and 
I was like, ‘Please don’t wake 
up,’ ” Nemitz said. “As I was 
rounding third and running to 
my teammates, I was thinking, 
‘This is real.’ So it just felt 
awesome.”
Where other 
seniors’ 
might 
be, 
Nemitz’s 
presence at the 
plate 
wasn’t 
long-cemented. 
Nemitz had only 
played 
in 
six 
games 
before 
this 
season. 
But now, with 
16 
starts 
this 
season, she has 
secured a place in the hitting 
order as a regular for the 
Wolverines.
Starting 
regularly 
at 
designated player, Nemitz has 
grown into embracing her role 
and hitting consistently, despite 
the 
difficulty 
that 
playing 
designated player and waiting 
long periods of time between 
at-bats presents.
“It was a position that was 
open and up for grabs, and she 
grabbed it,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “(She) really 

has just hung in there through 
her career and has gotten this 
opportunity. It’s been fun to 
watch.”
That moment of euphoria, 
running home to popsicle stick 
Mackenzie heads waving in the 
stands and beaming teammates 
meeting her at home plate, 
exemplified the work ethic and 
commitment that the Michigan 
softball program rewards.
“She’s always been a great 
teammate and worked hard, and 
it’s just great that she’s taking 
advantage of that opportunity,” 
Hutchins said. “The toughest 
kids of all have come from the 
wings. …They didn’t get their 
heads down or their nose bent 
out of shape. They didn’t start 
blaming or get sour. They just 
kept working and trying to help 
the team win, and those are the 
kinds of kids that you love to 
coach, and those are the kids 
who keep you coaching for 35 
years.
“A lot of people have to work 
their way up. And (Mackenzie) 
has really worked her way up.”
Yesterday’s 
ecstatic 
atmosphere as she ran into home 
plate certainly showed that.
So happy birthday, Mackenzie 
Nemitz. Yesterday you gave 
yourself one hell of a gift.

Wolverines place fifth at NCAAs

Going 
into 
Saturday 
morning, Michigan wrestling 
needed a strong day.
After aiming to win their 
respective divisions, only three 
of the eight Michigan wrestlers 
at nationals advanced to the 
quarterfinals. 
Those 
three 
wrestlers — fifth-year senior 
Alex Pantaleo, redshirt junior 
Stevan 
Micic 
and 
redshirt 
junior Myles Amine — were 
all two-time All Americans, 
all in their third quarterfinal 
appearances 
at 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament and all looking to 
push the Wolverines to a top-
five team finish.
And that they did.
The 
Michigan 
wrestling 
team placed fifth in the NCAA 
Championship this weekend, 
with 
third 
place 
finishes 
and All-American honors for 
Pantaleo, Micic and Amine in 
the 157-, 133- and 174-pound 
weight classes, 
respectively. 
Despite 
disappointing 
outcomes 
for 
several 
wrestlers, 
including 
heavyweight 
freshman 
Mason 
Parris, 
the Wolverines’ 
performances 
secured a team finish on par 
with the No. 5 ranking the team 
sustained throughout the dual 
meet season.
Thursday’s rounds proved 
tough for Michigan, with losses 
in multiple weight classes. At 
heavyweight, Parris lost in 
the first round to Iowa’s Sam 
Stoll. Sophomore Drew Mattin, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Kanen 
Storr and redshirt junior Logan 
Massa also sustained defeats 
early in the second round in 
the 125, 141 and 165 divisions, 
respectively. Parris’ loss in 
particular marked a premature 
end to the season considering 
his breakout performance after 
burning his redshirt earlier in 
the season.

“He 
had 
a 
tremendous 
freshman year and out of the 
eight All-Americans, he beat 
four of them this year,” said 
Michigan coach Sean Bormet. 
“He fell a little short first round 
but he had a great run in the 
wrestlebacks and scored a lot of 
points for the team in the blood 
round. But he really wrestled 
really hard.”
Despite 
early 
losses, 
all 
four contributed to the team 
score with their 
regular 
bracket 
performances 
and wins in the 
wrestleback 
rounds. 
Even 
with 
those 
early 
letdowns, 
with 
fifth-year 
Malik 
Amine’s 
1-2 
elimination 
from contention 
in consolations, 
Pantaleo, 
Micic 
and 
Myles 
Amine found success in early 
rounds of the tournament.
In the first two rounds of 
the 
tournament, 
Pantaleo 
defeated Buffalo’s Alex Smythe 
in a major decision and Army’s 
Luke Weiland, 5-3. In similar 
fashion, Micic plowed through 
Stanford’s Mason Pengilly, 18-7, 
and Purdue’s Ben Thornton, 
11-2, and Amine beat Rutgers’ 
Joe Grello and Navy’s Spencer 
Cary in a 12-3 major decision.
“They 
competed 
with 
everything they had and did a 
tremendous job battling their 
way to a third place finish,” 
Bormet said.
Entering 
Friday 
morning 
with those wins under their 

belt, 
the 
three 
Wolverines 
advancing to the quarterfinals 
all lost in that round. While 
Amine 
defeated 
Lehigh’s 
Jordan 
Kutler 
before 
his 
eventual loss to No. 1 seed 
Mark Hall of Penn State, Micic 
and Pantaleo both lost in the 
first match of the quarterfinal 
round. All three moved into 
the third place consolation 
round on Saturday to finish the 
weekend.
“It was a really tough round 
on Friday night and Stevan, 
Miles and Alec’s goals were to 
be NCAA champions, so they 
were disappointed on Friday 
night,” Bormet said. “But we 
had a brief team meeting and we 
talked about the opportunities 
that were still in front of them 
on Saturday and how important 
it was to them to dig deep and 
put their best performance on 
the mat for Michigan, our fans, 
our alumni, their high school 
programs and their families.
“They dug deep and did a 
great job.”
In a 6-0 bout Saturday, 
Amine, Pantaleo and Micic 
all won both their respective 
matches and the third place 
title. 
Those 
places, 
with 
wrestleback wins, earned the 
team 62.5 points, just enough 
to edge out Missouri — which 
finished with 62 points — for 
fifth place.
“We had many ups and 
downs, but I was really proud 
of the strong finish we had on 
Saturday to produce three third 
place All-Americans and finish 
fifth as a team,” Bormet said. “I 
feel good about our season.”

‘M’ tops Niagara, 16-5

The small, yellow ball soared 
from stick to stick as senior 
Bronwyn 
Shields 
connected 
with her teammate, who sent 
that small, yellow ball to the 
back of the net.
The horn sounded, the crowd 
cheered and the two embraced as 
the Michigan women’s lacrosse 
team increased its lead to 10. 
More importantly, however, 
was the emotion from freshman 
Caroline Cullinan, who had just 
scored her second career goal 
with the Wolverines. She didn’t 
see the field for the Dartmouth 
game that went into double 
overtime on Feb. 17, or for either 
Big Ten matchup 
— 
arguably 
Michigan’s 
three 
biggest 
games 
of 
the 
year. 
But 
she 
had just put her 
team back into 
a 10-goal lead 
as the clock ran 
down with 4:43 
left to play. 
The support, 
the cheers, the emphatic goal all 
served as a big reminder.
This is why you play.
With the help of Cullinan’s 
goal — in addition to goals 
from senior Adriana Pendino, 
freshman Erin Garvey, juniors 
Catherine 
Granito, 
Molly 
Garrett, Lilly Grass and Nadine 
Stewart and hat tricks from 
sophomores 
Erin 
Daly 
and 
Maggie 
Kane 
— 
Michigan 
topped Niagara (3-6), 16-5.
The 
Wolverines 
held 
a 
convincing lead through the 
whole game with the help of 
key saves from within the net, 
despite numerous fouls and 
yellow cards. As the Purple 
Eagles scored three goals within 
the last 20 minutes of play to push 
itself out from the running clock 
rule, Michigan’s defense upped 
the ante and the Wolverines 

scored three statement goals to 
close out the game.

The 
eighth-ranked 

Wolverines improved to 12-0 on 
the season, growing the nation’s 
longest winning streak of 14, 
dating back to Apr. 21. 
Michigan is one of three 
Division I teams that remain 
unbeaten, which puts them in 
the company of No. 1 Boston and 
No. 2 Maryland. As a new varsity 
sport, only in its sixth season, 
Michigan women’s lacrosse is 
now on the map and a force to be 
reckoned with.
“Winning 
talks,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Hannah 
Nielsen. 
“Winning 
gets 
attention. Obviously being 12-0, 
I think it’s the best record in the 
country 
right 
now, and I think 
that says enough. 
This is obviously 
the best season 
we’ve 
had, 
and people are 
paying attention 
to that.”
The 
Wolverines 
led, 6-0, just 10 
minutes 
into 
the game and finished the half 
up 9-1. This allowed for players 
who don’t usually see as much 
playing time, like Cullinan, or 
sophomore goalkeeper Arielle 
Weissman, to see the field and let 
their hard work come to fruition. 
“I think that those same 
players are the players that 
either push us in practice as 
starters playing the scout team, 
or just they’re competing with 
us and pushing us to do our best 
each and every day,” said senior 
starting goalkeeper Mira Shane. 
“So, to see them out on the field, 
you know, that’s the reason why 
you play. I think sports are great, 
but in the long run … for them 
to get time, and to have fun, 
and to get to play the game that 
we all love, I don’t think there’s 
anything better than that.
“Except winning, of course.”

Novice rowing program turns walk-ons into national champions

In 
observance 
of 
Women’s 
History Month, The Daily’s sports 
section is launching its second 
annual series aimed at telling the 
stories of female athletes, coaches 
and teams at the University from 
the perspective of the female sports 
writers on staff. We continue the 
series with this story from Daily 
Sports Writer Lane Kizziah.
Last spring, as the 2V8 boats 
lined up at the start of the grand 
final of 
the 
NCAA 
Rowing 
Championships, Madison Byrd 
took a second to appreciate 
where she was. She sat with arms 
outstretched and her blade in 
the water, and as she waited for 
the horn to sound, something 
dawned on her.
Byrd was about to race for a 
national championship in a sport 
she knew little to nothing about 
just two years earlier.
“I was shaking because I was 
so nervous,” Byrd said. “But I 
was also so thankful for what the 
novice program had done for me.”
The current junior walked onto 
the novice team — for athletes that 
hadn’t been recruited to row — at 
the beginning of her freshman 
year. Like most of the novice 
rowers, she was a competitive 
athlete in another sport in high 
school. Byrd knew she couldn’t 
play volleyball, her first love, at a 
school like Michigan, but she still 
had an “itch to compete” after 
graduation. She wasn’t ready to 
give up being a student athlete.
At the suggestion of a friend, 
Byrd reached out to the novice 
coach midway through her senior 
year and started training for 
tryouts before she even got on 
campus, although this wasn’t the 
norm for freshmen joining the 
team. 
“The novice coach does a lot of 
recruiting on campus,” Byrd said. 
“I’d guess every girl on campus 
has been approached by the 
rowing team at Welcome Week or 
in the Diag or Festifall and a mass 
email goes out at the beginning of 
the year.”
That mass email is what drew 
Lara Vanderbilt to the team this 
fall.
Like the majority of the novice 

team, the sophomore transfer 
student didn’t know much about 
the sport before deciding to try 
out. But, that hasn’t limited her 
success as she’s spent all spring 
bouncing between the top two 
novice boats.
“(Tryouts) were a little scary, 
just because there were so many 
girls there,” Vanderbilt said. 
“I really wanted to find a like-
minded group of women that 
would be my great friends and I 
could get strong with.”
In such a technical sport, the 
novices spend the beginning 
of fall season working on the 
mechanics of the rowing stroke. 
From the catch to the drive and 
the finish, there are dozens of 
small details that can take years 
for a rower to fine-tune. Not only 
does a rower have to focus on her 
own stroke, she also has to make 
sure that her timing matches the 
seven other athletes in the boat. 
Despite the difficulty of this 
juggling act, novices are thrown 
into the mix off the bat.
“You start off novice year and 
you plop eight girls in a boat and 
you don’t know what starboard or 
port is,” Byrd said. “But, you take 
a hold of the oar and you start 
moving up and down on the slide. 
Slowly but surely, your coach 
is teaching you how to insert 
the blade into the water, how to 
pull through, how to feather the 
blade.”
Although it’s a very technical 
sport, the lack of positions in 
rowing make it more adaptable 
than others, such as soccer or 
basketball, where it can take years 
for players to learn the nuances 
of a particular role. Once the 
novices conquer the mechanics of 
the stroke, they are ready to race.
While the actual movements 
may be adaptable, the physical 
and mental strains of training 
can create a hard transition 
into the sport. A combination of 
self-selection and cuts shrink 
the group from almost 200 to 
just three boats of eight by way 
of conditioning inside on ergs, 
which rowers refer to as “torture 
devices.”
Those who stay — like Byrd 
and Vanderbilt — stick out the 
arduous 
training 
because 
of 
strong connections with their 

teammates and a competitive 
drive. Through facing constant 
physical challenges, these women 
are pushed farther than they ever 
thought was possible, leaving 
them to wonder what else they’re 
capable of.
“I love the saying, ‘Those 
who stay will 
be 
champions’ 
because if you 
stick it out all 
four 
years, 
you will be a 
champion in so 
many 
ways,” 
Byrd said. “It 
shapes 
your 
character 
into 
something 
you 
never 
thought 
it could be. You have a whole 
new take on life and how to get 
through difficult situations. It 
gives you way more motivation to 
get through challenges in life.”
The novice team gives these 
women the rare opportunity to 
compete as Division I athletes 
with no prior experience in their 
sport — making the physical and 

mental challenges of adjusting to 
a new sport worth the effort.
Many of these women, like 
Byrd, go on to have remarkable 
careers on the varsity team later 
in their careers. Senior Victoria 
Glunt may have started on the 
novice team three years ago, but 
by her junior year, 
she was rowing 
across the finish 
line in of the NCAA 
Championships 
in the top varsity 
eight. 
Senior 
Emily Krebs has a 
similar story. After 
starting out as a 
walk on, she was a 
member of the 1V4 
that finished fifth 
in the country last spring.
Novice year is full of firsts, 
from the first time on an erg 
to the first time on the water, 
rowing under a pink sky. Another 
first is fast approaching for this 
year’s novices: the first spring 
race, which will take place next 
weekend against Harvard.
“It’s hard as a novice rower who 

has never had the opportunity to 
race — it’s hard to imagine that day 
coming,” Vanderbilt said. “People 
who have experience racing talk 
about it as this culminating, 
beautiful but very hard moment, 
but none of us can really imagine 
it. All of the physical building of 
this winter has been to do well at 
these races but we’re just sort of 
dreaming up what it would be.” 
Byrd 
remembers 
her 
first 
spring race well. Going in with no 
expectations, the top novice eight 
faced Ohio State and Notre Dame.
“When we lined up for our 
first race, we thought ‘Let’s see 
if we really can be good,’ and we 
won that race,” Byrd said. “It’s 
a shock to your system because 
racing a two (kilometers) hurts 
like hell. That’s what you have to 
deal with physically. Mentally, 
what you go through during a 
race, you have to stay so focused 
on the rhythm and the person in 
front of you. You’re also letting 
your competitive nature fuel you 
in order to walk back up on teams 
and cross the finish line first even 
though it hurts horribly.”

As the 2V8 boats lined up at 
the start of the grand final of the 
NCAA championships last spring, 
Byrd sat at the catch, listening to 
the announcer call out the boats.
In lane one, Texas. Lane two, 
Virginia. Lane three Washington. 
Lane four, California. Lane five, 
Michigan.
Even through her nerves — 
whether in her first novice race 
or last year’s grand final in which 
Michigan came in fourth — 
Byrd has always appreciated the 
unique opportunity of being able 
to compete for the Wolverines, an 
opportunity she rightfully earned 
through her commitment to the 
novice program. And now, she 
knows the experience has been 
worth even more.
“Every single day has pushed 
me past every single point where 
I don’t think I can go any further,” 
Byrd said. “Mostly because I’m 
so inspired and motivated by 
my teammates every day. I have 
a newfound sense of how far I 
can push myself and how hard I 
can work in order to get the best 
outcome possible.”

March spotlight finding Livers

DES 
MOINES, 
Iowa 
— 
At Michigan’s media day in 
October, Isaiah Livers sat with 
two reporters as a swarm of 
cameras huddled around Jordan 
Poole a few tables away.
Naturally, the conversation 
shifted to Poole, and Livers’ 
reaction to seeing his best 
friend rocket to national fame 
overnight. At the time, Livers 
said he could never imagine 
being 
in 
Poole’s 
situation, 
insisting he works better out of 
the media spotlight.
“I think when you go through 
life, you’re always gonna get 
overlooked,” Livers said. “I just 
feel like that’s just how life is.”
Saturday night in Des Moines, 
those roles suddenly reversed. 
This time, Livers’ name shot 
across national airwaves after 
posterizing Florida’s Andrew 
Nembhard to help send the 
Wolverines to the Sweet Sixteen 
— the zenith of a postseason 
in which he has averaged 12.0 
points per game 
on 
58 
percent 
shooting.
As 
soon 
as 
Michigan 
opened 
the 
doors 
to 
its 
postgame locker 
room, 
Livers 
was surrounded 
by 
media 
members, 
two 
and 
sometimes 
three-deep. 
Without 
the 
assumption that Livers was 
amidst the huddle, it would’ve 
been impossible to locate him.
Across the room, sophomore 
forward CJ Baird looked on in 
awe as his often-overlooked 
teammate 
found 
himself 
in 
the spotlight. While the media 
attention was new — even to 
his teammates — the dunk itself 
wasn’t.
“I’ve gotten dunked on by him 
like six or seven times,” Baird 

said “… It’s great to see it on other 
people. Cause we get dunked 
on all the time in practice and 
finally seeing that on somebody 
else, it’s good.”
Those 
highlight-reel 
moments, 
though, 
hadn’t 
manifested themselves in games. 
Livers’ athleticism has always 
been on display, on the defensive 
end or in pregame warmups, but 
the confidence to go for it in a 
game had eluded him.
But as he drove to the rim with 
just Nembhard in his way, Livers 
knew this was 
different. Out of 
the corner of his 
eye, he caught 
Poole pointing to 
the sky, signaling 
the 
alley-oop 
that Livers might 
normally 
settle 
for.
Not this time.
Livers 
took 
off from beyond 
the restricted arc, exploding 
onto the rim with two hands 
and only realizing the ball had 
gone through when Michigan’s 
bench shot to the air in delight. 
As Livers returned to the floor, 
Poole’s calls for a pass had 
turned to a celebratory flex.
“When you see Isaiah dunk 
the ball, it looks different from 
your perspective but we see stuff 
like that all the time,” Poole 
said. “And being able to show his 
athleticism, it’s just amazing and 

it’s awesome.”
Just eight minutes earlier, 
Livers had found himself in an 
all-too-familiar spot, sitting on 
the bench with his confidence 
sputtering after a mental lapse 
that allowed the Gators to finish 
a lob at the basket. Assistant 
coach 
DeAndre 
Haynes, 
recognizing Livers’ frustration, 
instructed him to move on and 
take the ball to the basket with 
confidence.
For the rest of the game, he 
sat for just 1:24, scoring seven 
points and igniting Michigan to 
a 64-49 win.
“It’s incredible,” said assistant 
coach Luke Yaklich. “Isaiah’s 
worked his tail off and he has 
heard so many times in film 
sessions, ‘When are you going to 
take the ball to the basket hard? 
And land on two feet and finish 
at the rim or dunk on somebody.’
“And 
that 
moment 
right 
there was so fun because it was 
a culmination of a lot of film 
sessions and a lot of individual 
skill development work to get 
him to that spot.”
As Livers returned to the 
sideline with 24 seconds left 
and the win long secured, John 
Beilein met him with a hug as 
the Wolverines’ fans behind 
the 
bench 
rose 
in 
unison. 
Eventually, he made his way 
back to Haynes, who gave him 
two congratulatory slaps on the 
chest and one final message.
“I told you, man.”

Against Texas Tech, a tough lesson

With the bruises of last 
weekend’s weekend series with 
No. 19 Texas Tech behind it, the 
Michigan baseball team knows 
that it wasn’t good enough.
“We 
got 
exposed,” 
said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“We 
couldn’t 
hold 
(Texas 
Tech) down in the bullpen. 
They sped the game up on us 
defensively, they ran out one 
mid-to-upper 90s pitcher after 
the next and we weren’t able to 
handle it as well as we would 
have liked to.”
The setback comes after 
a first third of the season 
where 
the 
Wolverines 
put 
on a show, winning 15 of 19 
games with all components of 
the team clicking except for 
a week in California, where 
Michigan’s offense struggled. 
That problem seemed to fix 
itself in the first homestand 
of the season, when it crushed 
opponents 
Manhattan 
and 
Western 
Michigan. 
The 
solution, 
though, 
was 
temporary.
“We just couldn’t string 
(clutch) 
at-bats 
together 
against Texas Tech when we 

had our scoring opportunities,” 
Bakich said. “We probably had 
the best chance to win a game 
in game three against Texas 
Tech. We had the bases loaded 
twice and just couldn’t get that 
big hit. Against a good team, 
that’s what you need. You need 
those two-out RBIs.”
The sine curve of the offense 
wasn’t 
the 
only 
struggle 
against the Red Raiders — even 
Michigan’s strengths seemed 
to 
wilt. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
committed 
eight 
errors, costing them nine runs. 
Its pitching walked 19 batters, 
13 of which came from a leaky 
bullpen.
“They took advantage of our 
mistakes and they did what 
we’ve done to a lot of the teams 
that we’ve played and opened 
up a large margin in the 
scoring,” Bakich said. “When 
they walked us or made errors 
against us it usually turned 
into a big inning, and that’s 
what Texas Tech did against 
us.”
Now it’s time for Michigan 
to learn. The Big Ten season 
is around the corner, and with 
it comes the opportunity to 
play consistently good teams 
— those that will make the 

Wolverines pay when they 
make mistakes, in the same 
way the Red Raiders did.
“The validation of having 
been in coaching and being in 
college baseball for a long time, 
having validation that we’re on 
the right track,” Bakich said. 
“(Texas Tech is) ahead of us 
right now but we’re getting 
there and seeing how close 
we were through the early 
and middle part of the game, 
and seeing exactly what we 
can point to with some costly 
mistakes.”
It 
was 
an 
important 
weekend for Michigan. A team 
that has been high on itself was 
grounded. It can hit the reset 
button with this gut check. 
The Wolverines saw what they 
thought they were and saw 
they had a long way to go.
The timing of the measuring 
stick, 
though, 
is 
key 
for 
Michigan. It’s March instead 
of June, and the Wolverines 
have time to learn and reach 
their potential.
“I haven’t lost a single ounce 
of confidence in our team,” 
Bakich said. “And what type 
of team that we’re going to 
have this year as the season 
continues.”
