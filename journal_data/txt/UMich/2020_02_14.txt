The 
University 
of 
Michigan School of Public 
Health and Healthy Policy 
Student Association hosted a 
panel discussion focusing on 
the importance of health care 
policy in the context of the 
election year on Thursday 
afternoon. About 50 students 
and 
community 
members 
attended the event.
The 
panelists 
included 
Jonathan 
Cohn, 
senior 
national 
correspondent 
at 
HuffPost; 
Charles 
Gaba, 
health 
care 
analyst 
and 
founder 
of 
ACAsignups.
net; and Marianne Udow-
Phillips, founding executive 
director 
of 
the 
Center 
for Health and Research 
Transformation 
at 
the 
University. The discussion 
was moderated by Daniel 
Lee, associate chair of health 
management and policy.
Gaba 
discussed 
how 
health 
care 
policy 
has 
changed over the years with 
each election cycle in the 
context of divided opinions 

on 
the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act, commonly known as 
“Obamacare,” a health care 
reform law enacted under 
former 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
administration. 
According 
to 
Gaba, 
the 
repeal of Obamacare would 
be inefficient.
“We 
are 
spending 
as 
much money to put in the 
administrative 
oversight 
of work requirements as it 
would cost to just cover the 
people who would get kicked 
off of the program because of 
it,” Gaba said.
In 
the 
case 
of 
pharmaceutical 
drugs, 
Udow-Phillips said intense 
pressure from the public 
to target individual drugs 
in an effort to lower prices 
might be more effective than 
legislation. She stressed the 
power 
of 
pharmaceutical 
lobbyists and their ties to 
both the Democratic Party 
and Republican Party. 
“This is not a party issue, 
this is an issue of how 
powerful that lobby is,” she 
said.

The 
School 
for 
Environment 
and 
Sustainability 
hosted 
its 
annual 
Michigan 
Environmental 
Justice 
Summit 
on 
Thursday. 
About 700 students, faculty 
and Ann Arbor residents 
gathered in the Rackham 
Auditorium 
to 
honor 
the 
30th 
Anniversary 
of 
the 
“Incidence 
of 
Environmental 
Hazards 
Conference,” 
the 
1990 
conference 
that 
sparked 
high-level 
government 
meetings and contributed 
to the formation of an 
Environmental Protection 

Agency 
special 
task 
force under the Clinton 
administration.
The 
panelists 
on 
the 
National 
Panel 
of 
EJ 
Game 
Changers 
began 
by 
recognizing 
and 
celebrating the progress 
that environmental justice 
has made over time. While 
the movement first gained 
traction in 1982 through 
an 
Black 
community’s 
protest 
against 
a 
local 
waste landfill, it has now 
been expanded nationwide 
as 
more 
marginalized 
communities began to fight 
for 
their 
environmental 
rights.
Panelist 
Charles 
Lee, 
a senior policy adviser at 

the EPA, mentioned that 
the issue of environmental 
justice 
did 
not 
have 
a 
name 
when 
he 
first 
started 
working, 
but 
as 
communities 
have 
empowered 
themselves, 
real changes have been 
made and more scholarly 
work has been produced in 
the area. 
Beverly 
Wright, 
panelist and founder of 
the 
Deep 
South 
Center 
for 
Environmental 
Justice, also commented 
on 
how 
advocates 
and 
scholars 
have 
sparked 
policy changes that aid 
communities nationwide.
“If you think nothing has 
changed, this is light years 

in terms of the difference 
between 
the 
way 
we 
interact with government,” 
Wright said. “We literally 
had to lock EPA people in a 
room to listen to us. It was 
tough.”
Wright recounted how 
she first made a connection 
between 
justice 
and 
activism when she first 
witnessed the effects of 
local pollution on Black 
communities and pointed 
to racial segregation as 
one of the causes of such 
suffering.

For the fourth year in a 
row, the Detroit Community-
Academic Urban Research 
Center has partnered with 
Poverty 
Solutions 
at 
the 
University of Michigan to 
provide funding for projects 
seeking to develop policy to 
alleviate urban poverty. 
The Detroit URC is a 
community 
and 
academic 
partnership 
working 
to 
improve 
health 
for 
Detroit 
residents 
through 
community-based research. 
Barbara Israel, professor in 
the Department of Health 
Behavior 
and 
Health 
Education and director of the 
Detroit URC, said the URC 
partnership 
with 
Poverty 
Solutions is beneficial. It 
combines Poverty Solutions’ 
resources with the URC’s 
expertise in funding seed 
projects, which are projects 
that are launched with a 
small amount of funding. 
Israel 
said 
Poverty 
Solutions and Detroit URC 
selected 
projects 
based 
on 
how 
equitably 
they

Approximately 
30 
students gathered in the 
Yuri Kochiyama Lounge in 
the South Quad Thursday 
evening to attend “From 
Fear 
to 
Reality: 
Yellow 
Peril 
Anxieties 
Over 
Coronavirus,” 
hosted 
by 
the United Asian American 
Organizations.
This event was designed to 
educate students about how 
diseases 
have 
historically 
propagated 
discrimination 
against 
Asian 
Americans 
and address how racially 
charged anxieties due to the 
coronavirus outbreak reflect 
American ideals on health 
and immigration. 
LSA sophomore Victoria 
Minka, an intern for UAAO, 
opened up the presentation 
by discussing the role of 
modern 
pop 
culture 
on 
the 
frenzy 
surrounding 
coronavirus. 
Minka 
emphasized the importance 
of 
understanding 
how 
and 
why 
the 
spread 
of 
misinformation online led to 
the spread and normalization 
of 
xenophobia 
stemming 
from coronavirus.

KELSEY PEASE/Daily
Cura Partners’ Jason White discusses his career, culture, and commerce at the Yaffe Digital Media Initiative Speaker Series Thursday evening in the 
Ross School of Business. 

Jason 
White, 
chief 
marketing 
officer 
of 
the 
cannabis company Curaleaf, 
shared his favorite quote by 
playwright George Bernard 
Shaw at the Ross School of 
Business on Thursday to a 
crowd of about 100 people. 
White said it related to an 
overall theme of disruption in 
the marketing world. 

“A reasonable man adapts 
himself 
to 
the 
world; 
an 
unreasonable one persists in 
trying to adapt the world to 
his,” White quoted. “Therefore 
all progress depends on the 
unreasonable man.”
The Yaffe Speaker Series 
was co-founded by marketing 
lecturer Marcus Collins in 2018 
to invite various individuals 
to speak with students about 
pioneering 
change 
in 
the 
marketing industry. Collins 

spoke with The Daily before 
the Yaffe Speaker Series about 
why he felt White was a good 
choice for the series.
“So 
the 
Yaffe 
Speaker 
Series … is essentially an 
initiative at the Ross School 
of Business where the focus 
is to create programming to 
help prepare our students for 
the changes in the evolving 
media 
landscape,” 
Collins 
told The Daily. “Jason had 
a very glowing career. He 

has not only been navigating 
the digital landscape, he has 
been rewriting the rules and 
reimagining it.” 
White’s 
career 
started 
at 
Wieden+Kennedy, 
an 
advertising agency that works 
with large companies like 
Nike, when he was 28 years 
old. From the moment he 
walked in the doors, his White 
felt he had found his passion. 


Andrea Turpin, associate 
professor of history at Baylor 
University, 
presented 
a 
lecture on changes in views 
on the admission of women 
into institutions for higher 
education. Organized by the 
Bentley Historical Library, 
about 
30 
students 
and 
professors attended the event 
on Wednesday night in honor 
of the 150th anniversary of 
the admission of women to the 
University of Michigan.
Turpin, 
author 
of 
the 
award-winning 
book 
“A 
New Moral Vision: Gender, 
Religion and the Changing 
Purposes of American Higher 
Education, 1837-1917,” spoke 
about women’s struggle for 
admission at the University 
and their experiences with 
coeducation.
Turpin began the lecture 
by 
speaking 
about 
Alice 
Freeman Palmer, a student 
who enrolled at the University 
two years after it began 
admitting women in 1870. 
Turpin said Palmer convinced 
her parents to let her attend 

college as it would help her 
become a teacher, one of the 
few occupations widely open 
to women at the time.
“Alice Freeman Palmer’s 
influence winds through the 
development of three of the 
most prominent universities 
of 
that 
era, 
Michigan, 
Chicago and California, and 
two of the most prominent 
women’s colleges, Wellesley 
and Radcliffe,” said Turpin. 
“In other words, the advent 
of coeducation at Michigan 
mattered. 
It 
mattered 
a 
lot, not only for American 
higher education but also for 
American higher society.” 
Turpin said women did not 
usually attend college during 
the 1800s due to societal 
norms and expectations. 
“w”
According 
to 
Turpin, 
different views regarding the 
purpose of higher education 
shaped people’s opinions on 
women’s education.
“If 
serving 
the 
church 
meant only training ministers 
and most of the churches 
didn’t allow female ministers, 
it wouldn’t make sense to 
educate women,” said Turpin. 
“If serving the church was 

to educate as many people 
as possible to communicate 
the 
Christian 
message 
as 
intelligently as possible then it 
would make sense to educate 
women. In other words, it 
made sense to admit women 
to college if you believed that 
social change came from the 
bottom up.”
Turpin also said educating 
women was seen as a financial 
burden to some at the time. 
“It was, like many things, 
a question of money,” said 
Turpin. “You either had to 
raise the money to found 
entirely 
new 
colleges 
for 
them or you had to build more 
classrooms and dormitories 
for them at existing colleges 
whose funds were originally 
intended to educate society’s 
most influential leaders. Was 
it worth it?”
University alum Christina 
Karas said she attended the 
event to learn more about 
the history of women at 
the University and thought 
Turpin’s lecture was eye-
opening.
“I 
like 
how 
(Turpin) 
brought out things that I 
didn’t already know about the 
overall history of women’s 

lives at the U of M,” said 
Turpin. “We hear a lot about 
some certain specific women 
like Madelon Stockwell or, 
you know, Eliza Mosher, but I 
didn’t actually know as much 
about the broader student 
population and how they lived 
their lives.”
LSA freshman Rachna Iyer 
said she found it commendable 
that the University supported 
coeducation 
in 
the 
1800s 
at a time when many other 
places around the globe had 
contrasting views.
“As someone minoring in 
women’s studies, I learned so 
much about the history of the 
women preceding me at this 
university and their impact 
all around the world,” Iyer 
said. “It’s crazy to think that 
only 150 years ago I would not 
be able to join this university. 
It’s amazing to see how far 
we’ve come as a society, and 
although I know we still 
have got a long way to go, it 
is important to recognize the 
work of the women before us.”

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind-the-scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore 
Calder Lewis on his story “U-M Flint, Dearborn students push for 
University health services”:

“I started out with just one student source, which was the leader in the 
U of M Dearborn student government and through her, she was able to 
connect me with student government leaders from Flint and Dearborn, 
and also leaders in the One University campaign. And so together 
with all those sources, I put together a pretty complete picture of how 
students were feeling about the healthcare situation at the satellite 
campuses. The most interesting finding to me was that the University 
claims on their Public Affairs website that student populations are so 
different at U of M Ann Arbor versus the satellite campuses, that the 
satellite campuses don’t need on-campus healthcare; they say that 
the satellite campuses have more commuter students, more students 
who are close to their home doctor. But the responses I got from the 
students at those satellite campuses is that they’re also disadvantaged 
in a lot of ways. They often come from lower socioeconomic statuses. 
They have to work while they’re in school. And so healthcare without it 
being provided to them is just an extra burden on them.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
 Trump is using this re-definition of anti-Semitism, fairly 
explicitly, as a means to silence political speech that seeks to draw 
attention to human rights violations in Israel. Critique of a state — 
indeed, any state — must be protected and not be seen as a critique 
of the people of that state.”

CORONAVIRUS

“Where this started was 
with some false claims being 
made 
about 
coronavirus 
... information was spread 
without all the facts, so this 
has led to a sort of hysteria 
around this topic, which as we 
know is often more harmful 
than helpful and can feed into 
xenophobia,” Minka stated, 

“I know that memes can be 
funny, but when we start to 
normalize coronavirus ... then 
we start to also say that the 
reactions and the xenophobia 
off of those is also normal.”
Minka 
then 
discussed 
other 
reasons 
behind 
the 
widespread panic, such as 
the lack of a vaccine and its 
spread outside of mainland 
China while reminding the 
audience to put coronavirus 
in perspective to other, more 

prevalent diseases such as the 
common flu.
LSA 
senior 
James 
Lee 
expanded on the history of 
Yellow Peril. Yellow Peril 
was 
the 
nationwide 
fear 
and 
systemic 
scapegoating 
of 
Asian 
Americans 
that 
emerged in the 19th century 
in response to large numbers 
of Chinese railroad workers 
immigrating to the American 
West. He also discussed how 
laws such as the 1882 Chinese 

Exclusion Act were created 
during this time period to 
specifically 
discriminate 
against the Asian American 
community. 
Lee then spoke on how these 
laws were created to deny the 
Asian American community 
power as well as how this fear 
of marginalized communities 
continues to have an effect.
“All of this (the laws) is 
really about the preservation 
of power not given to the 


“The first time I walked into 
Wieden+Kennedy, 
that 
was 
when I understood passion,” 
White said. “That was when 
I understood a place that 
everything they do is about 
creativity. Everything they do 
is about enabling incredible 
creatives 
to 
do 
incredible 
creative things in the world.” 
White 
told 
students 
he 
worked 
as 
the 
managing 
director for Nike’s Shanghai 
office during the 2008 Beijing 
Olympics. White and his team 
worked on “launching the 
sports culture in Shanghai.” 
They centered their campaigns 
around Kobe Bryant and 100-
meter hurdler Liu Xiang.
“Our job was to get the 
Chinese athlete to think about 
really competing,” White said. 
“We came in with Nike and 
our job … was to let people see 
sports in a different way. Our 

entire strategy was what we 
called ‘dare to compete.’ If we 
could start with showing kids 
the self-expression and the 
fun that is sport … we can get 
them to actually think about 
competing.”
When 
Xiang 
withdrew 
from the race during the first 
heat, White and his colleagues 
reworked 
their 
message 
and released an ad with the 
message to “love sport even 
when it breaks your heart.”
“That came from focus,” 
White said. “That came from 
not walking away from the 
strategy. We told people to 
compete. That’s what we said 
and this is where we landed 
and it went everywhere.” 
White also worked with 
Tiger Woods’ campaign after 
his scandal in 2009. Again, 
he implemented his ideas of 
reworking the message to tell 
the personal story behind 
the athlete. He worked with 
the 
creative 
director 
of 
Wieden+Kennedy to create a 
close-up of Woods with audio 

from his late father, Earl 
Woods, in the background. 
“We were just thinking, 
‘what would Earl say? What 
would his dad say?’” White 
said. “We took the last shot 
(of previous footage), the 
truth, the authenticity in 
his eyes, and we found audio 
from Earl.” 
White was also the former 
executive vice president and 
global head of marketing for 
Beats by Dre and was there 
when the company partnered 
with Apple. As the pioneer for 
the #StraightOutta campaign 
in 2015, White was in charge 
of sharing Dre’s story of being 
proud of where one is from. 
“The power in Straight 
Outta 
Compton 
is 
they 
owned 
Compton,” 
White 
said. “We got to this thought 
of that’s just a human truth, 
if you can own your past, if 
you can own where you’re 
from, that becomes power. 
That becomes control, that 
becomes reassurance in who 
you are. We knew we wanted 

people to claim where they 
were from.” 
He invited various artists 
and athletes, such as Kehlani 
and Lebron James, to take 
photos 
with 
famous 
hip-
hop photographer Jonathan 
Mannion. Using this footage, 
White and his team released 
the photos with the “Straight 
Outta” tag and included the 
city the celebrity was from. 
The 
biggest 
jump 
in 
White’s career happened in 
2019 when he left Beats by 
Dre to work with the growing 
cannabis 
company 
Select 
Oil and CBD. White said 
the transition was not well-
received by everyone. 
“That wasn’t a very popular 
decision at the time,” White 
said. “CBD had just become 
legal and there were a lot of 
people that thought that was 
a bad decision.” 
White 
defended 
his 
decision by saying he wanted 
to create his own legacy like 
legendary music executive 
Jimmy Iovine.

“I want to build what 
Jimmy built,” White said. “I 
want my shot. I thought about 
Jimmy Iovine who’s always 
said, ‘Make fear the tailwind 
instead of a headwind.’ That 
has 
been 
my 
motivation 
since I got to this business, 
that has been what’s driven 
me since I left everything 
that was important to me.”
White ended his talk with 
a final message of listening 
to yourself.
“My message to you today 
is there are zero rules,” 
White said. “I think that you 
have to stop and you have to 
listen to your voice.” 
Collins 
then 
facilitated 
a Q&A with White. Collins 
asked what was the human 
story of Jason White. White 
said story centers around 
him trying to pay it forward. 
“I think what we’re doing 
in the social justice space 
with cannabis and trying to 
expunge records and reunite 
families and give people 
second chances,” White said. 

“The war on drugs ruined 
families and neighborhoods 
for generations. For me, to 
be able to now be a part of 
fixing that is … unreal.” 
Business 
seniors 
Sofía 
Ondina and Kush Choksey 
attended White’s talk to 
learn from his experiences. 
Ordina 
found 
the 
talk 
enjoyable and insightful. 
“I thought it was very 
enjoyable. 
Just 
learning 
about his career, getting his 
advice and his insights of so 
many years in the industry,” 
Ondina said. 
Choksey 
said 
he 
liked 
how White was speaking 
from personal knowledge in 
various fields. 
“I thought it was really 
authentic and he told his 
stories 
really 
well 
and 
seemed 
very 
passionate 
about what he was doing, 
like the social impact his 
work has,” Choksey said.

academic partners and how 
much potential they had for 
growth and sustainability. 
Projects were also evaluated 
on how well they improved 
the efficacy of programs and 
policies alleviating poverty.
“Part of our work has 
always been the importance 
of having community and 
academic 
partnerships 
do 
the research,” Israel said. 
“If we promote co-learning 
and capacity building of all 
the partners involved, the 
research needs to benefit 
the community as well as the 
academic partners.” 
Carol Gray, center manager 
of the Detroit URC, said 
the 
URC 
has 
worked 
as 
a 
matchmaker 
to 
create 
mutually beneficial research 
partnerships 
between 
academic 
researchers 
and 
community actors for over 
two decades.

“We’re 
celebrating 
25 
years of partnership,” Gray 
said. 
“The 
Detroit 
Urban 
Research Center is one of 
the 
longest 
community-
based participatory research 
partnerships in the country 
if not the world. And we’re 
very proud of reaching that 
milestone.”
This 
year, 
Poverty 
Solutions and the Detroit 
URC 
gave 
$26,500 
each 
to three projects: a team 
building 
a 
greenhouse 
combining 
technology 
with African traditions, an 
experiment in food delivery 
for low-income mothers and 
a study on entrepreneurship 
programs and socioeconomic 
mobility. 
Tammy Chang, assistant 
professor in the Department 
of 
Family 
Medicine 
and 
researcher 
for 
the 
food 
delivery 
experiment, 
said 
her team partnered with the 
Women, Infants & Children 
program 
in 
Washtenaw 
County to deliver healthy 

groceries to young and low-
income mothers. According 
to Chang, these mothers often 
face 
significant 
logistical 
barriers 
to 
finding 
and 
buying healthy food despite 
qualifying 
for 
government 
food 
benefit 
programs. 
She said her team sought 
to help communities often 
underrepresented or ignored 
in research. 
“It’s our job as community 
members and physicians and 
researchers to be out there 
in the community so that we 
can seek out people and be 
ready to listen,” Chang said. 
“And provide opportunities 
for people who typically don’t 
or can’t voice issues, and then 
create programs and projects 
and studies around those 
people.”
She said her project works 
to create evidence to show 
government agencies that an 
investment of $100 or less on 
mothers during pregnancy 
can greatly improve maternal 
and child health over their 

lifetimes.
Ron Eglash, professor at 
the School of Information 
and at the School of Art 
& Design, said his team is 
working to build a high-
tech 
greenhouse 
next 
to 
the Detroit MBAD African 
Bead Museum that combines 
cutting-edge 
technology 
with African economic and 
ecological traditions. 
He 
said 
his 
team 
was 
inspired 
by 
research 
he 
conducted on West African 
societies 
using 
bottom-up, 
generative economic models 
to 
keep 
wealth 
in 
local 
communities. 
Typically, 
Eglash 
said 
Western 
economic 
models 
include 
state or private corporations 
which extract and keep value 
from individuals. 
Eglash 
said 
the 
team 
intends for the project to 
be both educationally and 
economically beneficial. 
“If we can have robotic 
systems, automated systems 
in the greenhouse, we can 

have digital sensors, if we 
can have AI do some pattern 
recognition, it’ll not only 
benefit the greenhouse, but 
help educate University of 
Michigan students, who are 
right now asking themselves, 
how do I get to the cutting 
edge in robotics or AI, oh, I 
know, I’ll do some work for 
the military or I’ll work for 
this giant corporation and 
make some billionaires even 
wealthier,” Eglash said. 
Audrey Bennett, professor 
in the School of Art & Design, 
said the project demonstrates 
the role design thinking can 
play in generative justice. 
She works with a team of 
students 
across 
a 
variety 
of disciplines in design to 
teach how technology can 
augment African traditions of 
generative justice to improve 
communities. 
“(The students) have to 
work with the community 
to see how design could help 
the community to alleviate 
poverty,” Bennett said. 

One of those students is Art 
& Design graduate student 
Keesa 
Johnson. 
She 
said 
discussions about diversity, 
equity and inclusion, often 
ignore or neglect to talk 
about equity. 
“This project for me centers 
around equity,” Johnson said. 
“Generative justice … speaks 
to that healing that I’ve been 
looking for when it comes to 
equity.” 
Johnson 
said 
her 
work 
on the project connected 
concepts she’s learning in 
class about complex systems 
design to broader lessons 
about community. 
“It’s really about building 
community for the whole of 
society,” she said. “I’m not 
extracting 
anything 
from 
anybody, 
we’re 
building 
and we’re making and we’re 
exchanging, and it all goes 
back to one thing.”

these (chemical plants)? 
That’s when I made the 
justice 
connection,” 
Wright said. “I was always 
upset, but then I got 
angry.”
The panelists said some 
environmental 
activists 
failed to identify the racial 
and social facets of their 
movement. Rhiana Gunn-
Wright, panelist and a 
lead architect of the Green 
New 
Deal, 
remarked 
on 
the 
prevalence 
of 
such a norm during her 
experience 
working 
on 
the Green New Deal.
“I started truly seeing 
how much people wanted 
to combat the climate 
crisis 
without 
ever 
touching justice,” Gunn-
Wright said. “And I didn’t 
realize that that tendency 
was so deep.”
In an interview with 
The Daily, SEAS professor 
Paul Mohai, an organizer 

of the 1990 conference, 
gave the opening remarks 
for the panel, discussed 
how 
while 
the 
first 
conference 30 years ago 
focused 
on 
bringing 
attention to the issue, 
the 
current 
conference 
does more to examine the 
disproportionate 
health 
effects between different 
communities.
Robert 
Bullard, 
known 
as 
the 
“Father 
of 
Environmental 
Justice,” 
expressed 
his 
confidence 
in 
students 
as changemakers in the 
future and expanded on the 
focusing on inequalities 
in environment justice to 
The Daily. 
“This 
country 
is 
segregated, 
and 
so 
is 
pollution,” 
Bullard 
said. 
“What 
we 
have 
been 
fighting 
for 
in 
environmental 
justice 
is 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
no 
community 
is 
disproportionately 
impacted by pollution.”
Michelle Martinez, who 
served as the moderator 

for the panel, touched on 
her work as an activist 
and 
highlighted 
the 
importance of action to 
The Daily.
“Communities 
make 
change. 
Communities 

change 
laws. 

Mobilizations 
change 
laws,” Martinez said. “The 
big things that happen in 
the United States all were 
because of people, not 
because somebody in the 
capital had a good idea.”
After the talk, Rackham 
student 
Stephanie 
Szemetylo expressed her 
enthusiasm to integrate 
more about sustainability 
into her own discipline. 
“It was energizing to see 
the connectivity between 
the 
different 
panelists, 
the 
embeddedness 
of 
the 
field,” 
Szemetylo 
said. “Hopefully I can 
bring design into that 
environmental 
justice 
space.”

other,” Lee said. “In the 
American 
context, 
it 
is 
entrenched in our system to 
fear the other, so anyone who 
isn’t (obviously) ‘American.’ 
Any medical outbreak seems 
to justify already existing 
fears in the American body.”
Engineering senior Kathie 
Wu compared reactions to the 
coronavirus outbreak to other 
prominent health outbreaks 
such as SARS, HIV and Ebola. 
Wu 
noted 
how 
common 
efforts 
to 
contain 
these 
diseases such as quarantine 
and 
marginalization 
are 
ineffective and ultimately only 
serve to hurt and ostracize the 
affected populations rather 
than help the general public.
“A lot of the state responses 
to 
handling 
the 
spread 
of 
coronavirus 
and 
other 
diseases in the past have been 
to quarantine residents … but 
that isn’t the solution and 
it honestly just scapegoats 
already 
marginalized 
populations and intensifies 
the 
panic 
that 
already 

exists,” Wu said. “Airport 
(temperature) screening of at 
least 2.4 million Americans 
and 
Canadians 
coming 
in 
did not catch a single case of 
SARS.”
LSA 
junior 
Anna 
Dang 
concluded the presentation 
by 
highlighting 
how 
we 
can approach the discourse 
surrounding 
coronavirus 
moving forward.
“To talk about resisting the 
resurgence of Yellow Peril, in 
the U.S., rather than warning 
people about coronavirus, (we 
can) warn them about anti-
Asian rhetoric,” Dang said.
Dang also reminded the 
audience to keep in mind the 
exact statistics of the outbreak 
may be unknown given that 
the 
Chinese 
Government 
historically 
withheld 
information from the public 
during the SARS outbreak in 
the early 2000s.
In an interview with The 
Daily after the event, LSA 
freshman Rose Waas said the 
event was an opportunity 
to learn about the different 
viewpoints 
on 
coronavirus 
as well as how to approach 
the 
coronavirus 
discussion 

without 
unintentionally 
promoting xenophobia.
“I 
think 
it 
was 
really 
insightful. It really allowed us 
to explore a lot of perspectives 
that are behind coronavirus 
and other epidemics that have 
happened in the past and ways 
that we can stop the spread of 
hate and racism,” Waas said.
When asked what he hoped 
the audience learned from 
the event, James Lee once 
again stressed why people 
must carefully walk the line 
between justifiable fear over 
a global health crisis and the 
xenophobia that may stem 
from that fear.
“A good synthesis that we 
want people to take away is 
... any medical outbreak is 
not to be taken lightly, but 
at the same time, we have 
to recognize how it could 
contribute to further yellow 
peril discourse,” Lee said. 
The fear of the virus really 
ends up justifying not a fear of 
medical outbreak … but rather 
a resurgence of fear that 
already exists.”

Gaba, 
however, 
said 
he 
believed in the power of 
legislation and said he is 
optimistic 
of 
achieving 
universal 
health 
care 
in 

some 
form 
in 
the 
near 
future. According to Gaba, 
perspectives on the issue have 
already shifted from more 
conservative 
approaches 
in 
the past. 
“The greatest success of 
the ACA had to do with the 
philosophical 
mentality 

change that no one should be 
denied health care, which was 
not the default mindset 25 
years ago,” Gaba said.
Erica Hernandez, a first-
year Public Health graduate 
student, said learning about 
what is happening in Congress, 
especially 
regarding 
drug 

pricing, surprised her. 
“A 
couple 
of 
classmates 
and I attended the National 
Health Policy Conference in 
D.C., and this event was a nice 
complement in understanding 
the 
day-to-day 
changes 
being made for health care 
tomorrow,” she said.

Nursing freshman Josiah 
Ratts, a member of the Health 
Policy 
Student 
Association, 
said he found it interesting 
to hear experts in the field of 
health care policy talk about 
the future of health care.
“As someone entering the 
health care world, I want 

to stay informed on what’s 
happening, so this was all 
really new to me, especially 
the different options that the 
United States is going to have 
since this is an election year,” 
Ratts said.

A

s 
President 
Donald 
Trump took to the House 
of Representatives dais, 
grinned 
in 
encouragement 
along with his Republican 
colleagues’ “four more years” 
chant and refused a handshake 
from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, it 
became readily apparent that 
this year’s State of the Union 
address was going to be unlike 
any in recent history.
Customary 
to 
tradition, 
President Trump made frequent 
appeals to his administration’s 
achievements 
throughout 
his 
speech 
by 
honoring 
individuals 
whom 
he 
had 
invited to attend. However, 
Trump 
blatantly 
disgraced 
American democratic values 
and 
attacked 
his 
political 
opponents 
in 
deciding 
to 
honor 
conservative 
radio 
personality Rush Limbaugh 
with the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom during his address to 
the nation. 
Limbaugh 
has 
made 
his 
career 
as 
a 
political 
commentator 
with 
little 
regard 
for 
the 
unbiased 
scrutiny 
of 
facts 
or 
issues. 
Instead, 
Limbaugh 
approaches political discourse 
with a conservative outcome 
in mind and will find any 
means necessary to justify. 
He dictates his justifications 
to his listeners and instructs 
them on how they should 
think about political issues. 
This framework was evident 

in the “birther” movement 
when 
Limbaugh 
greatly 
contributed to the spread 
of a conspiracy theory that 
President Obama was born 
in Kenya, and thus, was not 
an American citizen. This 
style of press is a threat to 
American democracy as it 
promotes 
groupthink 
and 
false truths. 
In 
a 
December 
2016 
discussion 
of 
President 
Obama’s 
legacy, 
Limbaugh 
states 
that 
any 
“legitimate 
criticism” 
of 
the 
former 
President was “paralyzed” by 
his race, giving rise to what 
Limbaugh calls a “thugocracy.” 
This example along with many 
others 
demonstrates 
that 
Limbaugh has not hesitated to 
incite racism, misogyny and 
utter disrespect in justifying 
his conservative point of view.
Honoring 
Limbaugh 
with 
the highest American civilian 
honor legitimizes his means 
of informing the American 
public. Limbaugh’s award is 
not only a humiliation of the 
prior award winners, such 
as Rosa Parks and Harper 
Lee, but more importantly 
is a reproach to fact-seeking 
journalists, 
who 
are 
vital 
to our country’s democratic 
prosperity. The objective of the 
independent press should not be to 
laud politicians without question. 
A well and accurately informed 
electorate is a basic requirement 
for a democratic republic.

With Limbaugh over the 
radio waves and Fox News 
television, Trump has staunch 
supporters in the media who 
will rarely, if ever, criticize 
him. Meanwhile, he excludes 
left-leaning 
networks 
like 
CNN from coverage. Trump 
also exploits social media 
to denigrate any Republican 
who steps out of line with 
his agenda. This uniformity 
is unhealthy for American 
democracy, which is reliant 
upon the free expression of 
ideas, debate and compromise. 
Former 
Republican 
party 
leaders, like Mitt Romney, 
who are brave enough to stand 
up against the President find 
themselves mostly ostracized 
from the party. 
President Trump’s State of 
the Union was, in essence, a 
campaign rally. His choice to 
present the award during his 
address to the nation was a 
deliberate attempt to vex his 
opponents and to rally his 
base. He used surprise events 
like awarding Limbaugh and 
a returning soldier from war 
as 
reality 
television-type 
reveals. It will be interesting 
to see who Trump decides to 
award the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom in the future — 
possibly the entire “Fox & 
Friends” cast?

The student vote in 2020

T

his 
March, 
the 
presidential race will come 
to Michigan and allow 
University of Michigan students 
to raise our voices and exercise 
our civic duty. Both the Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
are 
holding 
their primaries on March 10. This 
provides a unique opportunity for 
people to choose the direction of 
their party and who they want to 
see on the ballot in November.
The primary is also extremely 
unique because it marks the first 
major election since the passage of 
Michigan’s Proposal 3, which made 
it significantly easier to register 
and vote in Michigan. Some of the 
most exciting aspects of Proposal 3 
include online registration, same-
day registration at the clerk’s office 
and no-excuse-needed absentee 
voting. These laws will make it 
much easier for Michigan students 
and residents to vote.
If you have a Michigan driver’s 
license or ID card you can now 
register to vote online. This process 
is extremely quick and easy. So 
today, whether you are on a Blue 
Bus, waiting for your class to start 
or studying in the library, take five 
minutes and register to vote.
If you are an out-of-state 
student you can choose to register 
in Michigan or your home state. 
Out-of-state 
students 
cannot 
register online in Michigan, but 
the process is still fairly simple: 
All you have to do is fill out a 
voter registration form and mail 
or deliver it to the local county, 
city or township clerk’s office. If 
you want to easily register, there 
are many organizations around 
campus holding voter registration 
drives, which are an easy way to 
get registered. The deadline to 
register both online and by mail is 
Feb. 24 — after that, you can still 
register in person up until and on 

election day at the clerk’s office. For 
information about registering to 
vote and deadlines, govote.umich.
edu has important information 
compiled by the Ginsburg Center 
for Community Service Learning.

Another 
exciting 
part 
of 
Proposal 3 is it now allows 
no-excuse-needed absentee voting. 
This means that students who feel 
they will be too busy to vote in 
person on election day can request 
an absentee ballot. There are so 
many reasons why students should 
go out and vote. Voting is one of our 
fundamental civic duties. There 
are people around the world who 
would give anything to have the 
right to live in a nation where they 
can vote in fair and free elections. 
By voting, you are recognizing 
these people, as well as honoring 
those who have fought and won the 
right to vote. This year marks the 
100th anniversary of the passage of 
the 19th Amendment, which gave 
women the right to vote. One of 
the reasons why I vote is to honor 
the memory and courage of the 
suffragettes who refused to give 
up until women had a right to the 
ballot box.
Every 
student 
at 
U-M 
is 
passionate 
about 
something. 
Whether it be health care, the 
environment, funding for STEM 
research or federal support for the 

arts, every student has an issue that 
mobilizes them. We are fortunate 
to live in an age where information 
is available at the tips of our 
fingers and it’s never been 
easier 
to 
find 
information 
on 
prospective 
candidates 
and their platforms. Even if 
you don’t know much about 
politics, spend five minutes on 
Google and find a candidate 
who aligns with your views.
Voting in the primary is 
especially exciting because it 
allows students to have a say 
in the future of their party. 
Unlike a general election with 
two stark choices, the primary 
allows people to choose among 
many candidates. As we saw in 
Iowa, the difference between 
first and second place came 
down to just a handful of votes. 
Your vote is so important, 
especially in a primary.
As young people, we often 
feel unheard. We see the 
government 
taking 
actions 
we disagree with, and we 
feel frustrated and forgotten. 
One of the reasons for this 
is because politicians know 
many young people do not 
vote. In 2018, 41 percent of 
U-M students went to the 
polls. If young people want a 
seat at the table, we need to 
have strong showings at the 
polls and show that our voices 
cannot be ignored.
Registering to vote has never 
been easier and voting has 
never been more important. 
That’s why all of us in the U-M 
community should head to 
the polls and make our voices 
heard in this primary and in 
the future general election.

Why nobody cares about Trump’s impeachment
L

et’s 
face 
it: 
Trump 
got 
impeached 
and 
nobody cared. The 45th 
President of the United States was 
investigated 
through 
multiple 
committees in the House of 
Representatives and impeached by 
a House vote of 230 to 197 and 229 
to 198 on each Article, respectively. 
For the third time in American 
history, 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
went 
through 
this 
careful constitutional process 
and was voted to stand trial 
in the Senate. How much of 
Americans collectively deciding 
not to care can be attributed 
to the symbiotic relationship 
between news coverage and 
viewer opinions? How much of 
it speaks to the divisive nature 
of Congress and politics in 
general?
Through 
our 
academic 
journeys, 
we 
learn 
about 
the constructs of American 
government. My U.S. History 
teachers 
emphasized 
the 
severity of impeachment. When 
a sitting president’s actions 
warrant impeachment talks, it 
should be treated as serious by 
both the media and the average 
American 
citizen. 
But 
this 
whole impeachment was just 
another unread story, another 
neglected piece of history.
The 
prior 
two 
times 
presidents have been impeached 
were in 1868 when Andrew 
Johnson violated a “tenure of 
office law” and also arguably 
“undermined the cause of racial 
equality” established by former 
President 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
only years earlier. President 
Bill 
Clinton’s 
impeachment 
in 1998 holds precedence as 
what most modern Americans 
associate with impeachment. 
Although 
the 
Articles 
of 
Impeachment were passed for 
Clinton’s 
dishonesty 
under 
oath, the Senate voted across 
party lines to acquit him, 
noting 
the 
overly-politicized 
charges. Why did people care 
so much more about Clinton’s 
impeachment than Trump’s? 
It can be argued that it is 
because Trump’s impeachment 

dealt with legitimate foreign 
policy concerns as opposed to 
lying about sexual relations 
under oath — much less juicy. 
Is that what we care about, 
entertainment 
and 
drama 
more 
than 
abiding 
by 
the 
Constitution?
It 
isn’t 
that 
this 
wasn’t 
interesting 
enough 
to 
care 
about; it was the generally-
accepted 
assumption 
that 
Congressional party lines are 
drawn with a thick Sharpie and 
this undeniable division made 
way for a predictable outcome. 
The Democratic House would 
impeach, the Republican Senate 
would acquit. It is important 
to 
recognize 
Senator 
Mitt 
Romney, R-Utah, who went 
against the Republican party 
by voting to impeach Trump, 

and who is now receiving a 
great deal of ostracism and 
hate for it. Whether you love 
“The Donald” or hate him, 
every American should hope 
for a less predictable outcome 
in 
important 
governmental 
processes like impeachment. 
I do not have a law degree 
(yet), nor can I sit here and 
write about the intricacies 
of the Constitution. I just 
wish we, could have more 
trust in the government, look 
past party lines and take an 
impeachment 
seriously. 
It 
is depressing, especially as 
a political science student, 
to see George Washington’s 
worst fears about a two-party 
system come true through such 
turbulent political parties. 
The 
news, 
generally 
speaking, has made things 

worse. I distinctly remember 
the 
notification 
popping 
up on my phone from The 
New 
York 
Times 
saying 
something like: “President 
Donald Trump has just been 
impeached by the House of 
Representatives.” News has 
a large impact on what we 
prioritize and how we think. 
So instead of aesthetically 
pleasing graphics and pop 
culture 
perspectives, 
the 
media 
should 
help 
the 
public 
understand 
what 
impeachment means.
People 
may 
not 
think 
their 
opinions 
matter, 
a 
feeling I relate to. Despite my 
excitement to partake in my 
first presidential election this 
year, I know my vote won’t 
make a difference (especially 
since New Jersey and I share 
the same political affiliation). 
However, I refuse to believe 
that we have done everything 
we can. We, meaning all of 
us: Democrats, Republicans, 
Independents, 
Libertarians 
and Green Party members 
alike can and must do more 
if we expect more from the 
government we put our faith 
in. 
Call your senators, stand 
up for what you believe in and 
demand your representatives 
find a balance between being 
a delegate working with their 
constituents and a trustee 
working for their constituents. 
Through 
all 
of 
American 
history, 
things 
have 
only 
changed because of passionate 
people who are not afraid to 
wait or to work. We shouldn’t 
have seen an impeachment 
trial pass us by, seemingly 
scripted as it went perfectly 
to plan. I know it’s naive to 
think partisanship will ever 
fully disappear — and frankly 
it shouldn’t — but next time 
something as important as 
an 
impeachment 
happens, 
no 
matter 
your 
political 
affiliation, care.

memory and

refused to give up. 

The media should

means.

Valentine’s Day has some claim on sentimentality. It launches love into 
the spotlight, or at least into your peripheral; it pits love and loneliness 
against each other, these umbrella terms used as placeholders to describe 
the diversity of feeling that actually overcomes us. These albums claim 
that sentimentality back. They let your love, heartbreak, or anything in 
between be yours, be more than just a refined, courtly love. We hope in 
these albums you find that indistinguishable, overwhelming feeling, the 
one you thought no one else could feel or put into words and sounds. Stick 
with us on these albums, in all their glorious contradictions, and hopefully 
they seep and settle into your 2020 Valentine’s Day.

For Love: 
Caroline Polachek, Pang
Caroline Polachek’s voice sounds like a hallucination. Watching the 
musician perform her debut album live — even in video — feels alien, 
like the high and acrobatic vocals integrated into each song aren’t really 
coming out of her mouth at all. Polachek, best known as the lead vocalist 
of electronic duo Chairlift, has a particular talent for creating music that 
makes a listener feel like they are walking on air. Her most recent release, 
Pang, is a record full of these moments, capturing the emotional confusion 
and ecstasy of new love with every arc of her uniquely flexible voice. 
From tongue-in-cheek dance anthem “So Hot You’re Hurting My 
Feelings” to raw ballad “Insomnia,” Polachek envelops the listener in a 
world where the simultaneous excitement and fear of losing yourself in 
love is made clear. Her songs are not typical love songs, but they are some 
of the truest presentations of real love that one could listen to — sometimes 
it’s fun, sometimes it’s hard, but giving yourself to another person wholly 
often feels like you’re entering a kaleidoscope of emotion. Polachek 
doesn’t try to navigate it, but rather embraces the frenzy of that state with 
every lyric and riff, making Pang a unique yet effective Valentine’s Day 
soundtrack.

Rex Orange County, Apricot Princess
You and your significant other are looking for a song to call “our song.” 
A song to send to one another when you’re happy or sad. A song for every 
heartfelt playlist, every long car ride together and to think of when you’re 
near or far.
Draw from a hat with every track on Apricot Princess and you’ve found 
your love song.
Rex Orange County captures the magic of a love that’s just beginning 
to blossom. Many a lover can relate to the life-changing chemistry of a 
new-found relationship as told on “Nothing”: “When we first spent the 
night / Nothing else would ever feel that way / In my room it all changed.” 
The excitement and butterflies of making the first steps together is 
encapsulated by “Television / So Far So Good”: “What about you and me 
together? / Something that can really last forever.” All this over smooth, 
sexy and sometimes somber instrumentation full of soft twinkles and 
piano keys. Apricot Princess is creative, full of sounds that always feel 
fresh, making for a goldmine of love songs that stand the test of time.
Maybe the most relatable sentiment is expressed on title track “Apricot 
Princess,” where Rex speaks on the doubt that so many relationships 
must withstand from faithless friends and family. “I wanna show them 
/ That this ain’t a fantasy, she’s my best fucking friend,” he sings. I can 
immediately think of my own “them” that Rex refers to — the people in 
my life whose thoughts and feelings I value, but who don’t have faith in my 
relationship’s longevity. Everyone has their own “them.” Every new lover 
comes with doubt from someone close, whether it’s well hidden or openly 
expressed. Weathering that doubt brings two lovers closer. Rex reassures 
us that real love is not just a fantasy.

Devin the Dude, Just Tryin’ ta Live
People tend to think that interpersonal love is the most important kind 
of love. It’s not. Everyone is obsessed with finding a partner they can live 
with, grow with and laugh with, but they forget who the most important 
person actually is. The true most important kind of love is self-love. It takes 

work, but not much; you already know yourself, you just need to own who 
you are and take care of yourself accordingly. 
If anyone knows that, it’s Devin the Dude. The oddball rapper was signed 
to Houston’s Rap-A-Lot Records (a pioneer for gangsta and southern rap) 
in the late ‘90s and 2000s. Despite Rap-A-Lot’s bad boy reputation, Devin 
was different. He’s insular, reserved and cautious, but he still knows how 
to have fun. In 2002, he released his magnum opus Just Tryin’ ta Live. It 
proved that rappers could be themselves and do the things that make them 
happy without maintaining any sort of image. 
Just Tryin’ ta Live is an album about just that: living for yourself and not 
giving a fuck. It kicks off with “Zeldar,” a goofy weed anthem that finds 
Devin rapping like an alien who just smoked for the first time. It’s a strange 
track, for sure, but Devin stays true to his weirdo roots and he owns it. The 
same goes for “R & B,” short for reefer and beer. It’s a track about drinking 
and smoking in an attempt to “Sit back and recline and try to relax [his] 
mind.” Devin knows what he needs, and he’s willing 
to go to lengths to get it. Album crown gem “Doobie 
Ashtray” is a testament to what happens when you 
forget about yourself and focus on others first, rapping 
on the hook: “What you gonna do when the people go 
home / And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer’s 
all gone / And somebody had the nerve / To take the 
herb / Up out the doobie ashtray / Why they do me that 
way?” 
Just Tryin’ ta Live, as a whole, is an album devoted to 
self-love, and Devin the Dude explains exactly who the 
most vital relationship is with — yourself. That’s all anyone really needs.

The Walters, Songs for Dads
The Walters 2014 EP Songs for Dads is not an overtly happy EP. In fact, 
several of the featured tracks focus on heartbreak, not joyful romance. 
Songs for Dads, however, is not an angst-fueled breakup album. Rather, 
this EP functions like a make-shift anthology series: Each song spotlights 
a different kind of love, from platonic to romantic, from painful to hopeful. 
Songs for Dads is on this list because it eyes the bigger picture. It elbows in 
some much-deserved room for all the other kinds of love we encounter in 
our lives. 
The Walters EP is full of opposites, too –– each song acts unexpectedly. 
Lover’s laments are matched with a bouncy-beat and touch of lightness; 
sadness is turned on its head, and ushered out the door. Perhaps the best 
example of this is “I Love You So,” a song about struggling to let go of toxic 
relationships despite still being in love. Yet, the repetitive chant of the 
chorus “But I love you so” is hypnotizing and encompassing. These words 
echo loudly, obscuring the rest of the lyrics –– a fitting parallel to the 
turmoil of the moment. The song is bittersweet, like the rest of the album. 
Bittersweet may seem strange for a Valentine’s day album, but isn’t that 
how love is? Even at its best, no love is perfect, whether it be for lovers, 
family or friends. Songs for Dads adds a touch of realism, then. Maybe we 
don’t need another reminder of love’s imperfections. That’s okay –– like I 
said, The Walters don’t do “sad” very well anyway.

For Heartbreak:
Spiritualized, Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space 
What are all the emotions that one experiences after a breakup? After 
getting dumped by Kate Radley, Jason Pierce of Spiritualized decided 
to write Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space, an album that 
answers that very question. 
1. Nostalgia
Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space begins with Pierce 
feeling a deeply nostalgic love. It is powerful, but also temporary. 
2. Withdrawal
The next emotion is withdrawal. There is a brutal comparison made 
between infatuation and drug addiction. The statement ‘love is like a 
drug’ could not be more true for Pierce, who acknowledges he has since 
switched to heroin.
3. Cynicism
As a result, Pierce becomes cynical. His cynicism makes him think love 
is nothing more than a primitive reaction akin to hunger.
4. Obsession

After this is obsession. At first it’s a romantic obsession, one that 
lacks real agency and only provides a wistful memory. Then it becomes 
dangerous. Like driving a car too fast or as Pierce puts it, “playin’ with fire.” 
5. Frustration
Later, there’s frustration. Frustration from his lack of productivity, 
from his inability to stop drinking. All of this because he can’t get her off 
his mind. This love is like a ringing in the ears that just won’t go away.
6. Acceptance
Then comes acceptance, but in a rather pitiful fashion. Pierce 
understands and accepts that she doesn’t love him anymore. He just begs 
for it to be a gradual process. But at the time he wrote this, he knew what 
happened was the polar opposite.
7. Collapse
He ends the album not able to get over her. The feeling of a burden 
lifted that was supposed to arrive with time hasn’t come yet. This leads 
him into a deeper cycle of drug abuse. Love is cruel. 
Pierce knows this more than most, because he had to 
record the entire record alongside his band member, 
keyboardist and prior lover: Kate Radley.

Soccer Mommy, Clean 
Sophie Allison, better known as Soccer Mommy, 
released her studio album Clean in 2018, following her 
rise on platforms like Bandcamp (a rise propelled by 
grungy love songs). Clean’s sound is no different from 
her older music in terms of its discordant style and soft sighs of vocals, 
but the variety of heartbreak songs on the album is ingenious. Allison 
goes from “Your Dog,” a bitter, angry anthem about not wanting to be 
treated like a “fucking dog,” to “Blossom (Wasting All My Time),” a heart-
wrenching, vulnerable track that’s simple yet personal. The record is an 
all-encompassing breakup album; it’s great for feeling angry and powerful 
after having your heart broken, but also for burying your face into a pillow 
and sobbing. Arguably the best breakup song of all time is “Still Clean,” the 
first track on the album. I cannot reasonably guess the number of times 
I’ve cried to that song, both when I’ve been actually sad and when I had 
no reason to be sad at all — just for a good cry. Clean came to me when I 
was going through my first real breakup and I truly believe it was a match 
made in heaven. I don’t think any other album will ever carry me through 
heartbreak the way this one did. And for that, Sophie Allison, I thank you.

Taylor Swift, 1989
I’ll admit it, the day I found out Taylor was breaking up with country 
music, I shed a few tears. And it wasn’t until months later, pacing my room 
as I hit play on my favorite artist’s first pop album, that I was finally set at 
ease. I loved it. Of course, 1989 is a breakup album in the more traditional 
sense as well. Almost every track finds Taylor peering behind her, trying 
to figure out how a past relationship with a certain boy band member 
turned sour. The upbeat, ‘80s synth production just barely manages to 
coat over her heartbreak. But that’s the magic of it. Somewhere in the 
hours of Taylor footage seared into my brain, I can see her saying, “Just 
because something is over, doesn’t mean it wasn’t special.” 1989 captures 
that. Songs like “Out of the Woods” and “Wildest Dreams” aren’t meant to 
diminish a failed relationship, but remember it for what it was in all of its 
heart-racing, mind-boggling, ill-fated glory. 
Taylor chopped her signature curls, moved to the big city and took the 
biggest risk of her career — and was rewarded for it. Listening to 1989, you 
get the feeling that you can start all over again too, then come back better 
than ever.

Fleetwood Mac, Rumours 
Rumours was Fleetwood Mac at their most successful, yet their most 
unstable. The thematic cohesion of this spiteful album evolved from a 
uniform distaste among the band members for each other; Rumours is the 
bitter aftermath of fractures and splits within Fleetwood Mac.

For love and heartbreak: Music for your Valentine’s Day

VALENTINE’S DAY SPECIAL EDITION: MUSIC NOTEBOOK

DAILY MUSIC WRITERS
For The Daily

Picture yourself on a date. You’re all dolled up and 
looking fine for that special someone. It’s late at night and 
hopefully, you’re snuggling with your crush under layers 
of blankets and pillows. If you’re lucky, the two of you 
have made a dent in that bottle of wine. The lights are low 
and in the background you hear the soothing sounds of … 
button mashing. Yes, the clicking of game controllers is the 
soundtrack to your romance because this date isn’t your 
usual date. Tonight is game night. The modern dating 
scene is tricky, with intimacy being as hard to come by 
as a good match on Tinder. With people devoting more 
and more time to their screens it has become completely 
normalized to share a screen and “Netflix and Chill” with 
your partner. However, instead of falling into a millennial 
cliche, young bachelors and bachelorettes can all benefit 
from switching it up and geeking out with a quality video 
game. You two still share a screen, the mood is still light-
hearted and best of all you actually talk. Video games 
require cooperation, communication and trust — the 
foundation of all healthy relationships. Regardless of your 
skill level, here are three great games for date night.
“Overcooked”
Since nothing is sexier than swooning over your 
partner’s tasty home cooked dinner, why not test 
the waters digitally before you waste a bunch of 
groceries? “Overcooked” is perfect for casual fun. This 
frantic cooking game will have you and your partner 
controlling friendly woodland animals dressed as 
chefs who need to perform simple cooking tasks within 
3-minute rounds. Though every individual action is 
simple, the frying, chopping, plating and transport 
of a single burger will have you and your partner 
communicating at every second. Couple this with a 
plethora of maps that are designed to intentionally 
inhibit your workflow and “Overcooked“ becomes a 
game of cooperative finesse. Yet there is never a need 
to stress out. The absence of harsh punishments and 
antagonists keep “Overcooked” an adorable experience 
that will have you and your date laughing over your 
blunders and celebrating each little achievement. 

“Lovers in a Dangerous Space-Time” 
A game that seems like it was made for date night, 
“Lovers in a Dangerous Space-Time” is an astro-trip 
into a universe of galactic neon cuties fighting to save 
the forces of love from the ever-encroaching evils of 
anti-love. The 2D retro aesthetic is amazing and looks 
like neon signs in motion. With a slightly higher barrier 
of entry, “LDST” is still easy enough for beginners but 
also a good challenge if you or your partner happens 
to be a veteran. The core gameplay consists of you 
and your date controlling a space ship equipped with 
thrusters, blasters and a shield. Only one station can be 
manned at a time, so when your partner is blasting the 
bad guys, it’s your job to make sure the ship moves in 
the right direction. This makes trust and cooperation 
necessary and will have you and your date bonding 
over your hatred of fun-ruining monsters and your love 
of space-faring (and maybe each other).
“A Way Out”
If it’s not the first date and you’re looking to impress 
your sweetheart with a more artistic and emotional 
experience then you should try “A Way Out.” The 
most serious of these three, “A Way Out” is a cinematic 
adventure akin to playing a Martin Scorsese film. Set in 
the 1970’s, you and your crush will inhabit two convicts 
conspiring to break out of prison and exact revenge on 
those who put you there. “A Way Out” is completely 
plot-driven, meaning you and your partner will have 
the same story but play a different narrative depending 
on which of the two convicts you each choose. This 
difference in character arcs personalizes the game 
while still making it feel like a shared experience. 
Trust and cooperation are always needed, but choice 
also takes a crucial role in the gameplay. Since the two 
characters have different personalities and therefore 
different approaches to certain situations, deciding 
who will do what can alter a specific outcome. The 
length of “A Way Out” will span several hours so plan 
on multiple dates almost as if you were going to watch 
a whole season of your favorite TV show with your 
crush. In the end, the payoff is worth it and hopefully, 
the seriousness of “A Way Out” will allow you to learn 
something deeper about your partner.

Three video games for 
you and your valentine

ELI LUSTIG

The rehearsal studio in the Power Center for the 
Performing Arts for We the PROUD’s “What Was + 
May Be” is strikingly simple. Several black stage blocks 
dot the gleaming polished floor, a rope rests coiled on 
the ground and four students sit chatting in a circle. 
Two people are dressed in minimal costume pieces 
and two have laptops balanced on their laps.
They are Music, Theatre & Dance junior Alyxandra 
Ciale Charfouros and Rackham student Michael 
Yuchen Tong. In addition 
to conceiving “What Was 
+ May Be,” Charfourous 
and Tong star as well in the 
story depicting their own 
relationship. While they met 
in high school, the pair have 
been apart for five years, 
and are just now reuniting. 
The show will include their 
own experiences, as well as 
stories from other couples in 
long distance relationships 
they have interviewed. Also present in the rehearsal 
room are Music, Theatre & Dance senior Amanda Kuo 
as the director and Music, Theatre & Dance and Art & 
Design sophomore Nicole (Niki) Denise White as the 
art designer.
Charfouros explained a bit of the plot of the show. 
“This is our story of being in a long distance 
relationship and now coming together after five years,” 
Charfouros said. “It’s kind of a memory play and it’s a 
devised piece.” 
She described the challenges of both writing and 
performing, detailing how the creation of this show has 
required her to trust both her “expression and story.”
“I wrote this story, and I’m performing in it so 
it’s really new and challenging to trust it from a 
bunch of different perspectives: as a playwright, as a 
performer, and as a producer,” Charfouros said. “We 
talk about wearing a lot of hats ... I want to be able to 

just wear my expression throughout different roles and 
responsibilities.” 
Another aspect of “What Was + May Be” is the fact 
that it showcases only Asian American performers. 
Charfouros mentioned how she questioned whether 
this fact causes this show to be an Asian American 
play, or if maybe it is a part of a larger genre of Asian 
American theatre. There seems to be a greater question 
of what it means to represent an identity in an art form 
such as this. 
“There are two Asian Americans onstage and that 
in and of itself is breaking the boundaries of what is 
mainstream,” Charfouros said.
Not only is this an 
original show, but it’s also 
the first piece of theatre 
from 
the 
new 
student 
production company, We 
the People Representing our 
Unifying Diversity (or We 
the PROUD) Polycultural 
Productions. The reasoning 
behind the creation of this 
organization was to “make 
space 
for 
marginalized 
voices,” 
said 
director 
Amanda Kuo. 
“We have all these amazing resources and tools and 
training from the University of Michigan, but we were 
kind of not really loving the stories that we were given 
to be told,” Kuo said.
Kuo echoed Charfouros’ sentiments that this show 
is an example of how representation can be as simple 
as featuring people with different racial or ethnic 
identities. She also added that diversity in the theatrical 
world does not have to stop at performers. 
“It’s one of the few places I’ve been where some 
days only Asian-Americans are in the room creating 
theatre,” Kuo said. “It feels really safe and it’s all 
original.”

My first valentine

CLARA SCOTT
Daily Columnist

In my mind, Valentine’s Day is 
simply the precursor to sales on 
chocolate and pretty pink foil-
covered things, both of which 
I have a soft spot for. At least 
they have been for the past 21 
years of my life — I have never 
been in a long-term relationship 
until now, never considered the 
prospect of romance as a part 
of the equation when it came to 
February plans. No, February 
14th was simply a week and two 
days before my mom’s birthday, 
a month and three until my 
own birthday on St. Patrick’s 
day. It was a day where I could 
bathe in romantic comedy plots 
and not worry about how they 
were conditioning me, cut pink 
hearts out of construction paper 
and cover everything I owned 
in glitter. Sometimes my mom 
would send me a package full of 
candy, which I would consume at 
a disgusting rate. 
Every year, this day was a 
moment of flux in the winter 
wind, watching couples walk 
from bar to restaurant to their 
apartments 
and 
wondering 
whether I’d ever have what they 
did, genuinely not believing 
that I ever would. But what I’ve 
found, weirdly enough, is that 
Valentine’s Day this year doesn’t 
feel any different. Sure, it’s an 
excuse for me to be even more 
mushy with my partner than I 
usually am, but beyond that, I am 
completely the same. 
The reason this feels so 
strange to me is that I am truly, 
deeply a romantic in every sense 
of the word. I thought that the 
second I had my first Valentine, 
all of the candy and roses would 
make sense, that I would feel 
romantic and warm inside and 
like all was right with the world. 
I would sit at a white tablecloth 
with a candle lit, smile and watch 
my imaginary partner smile 
back. But when I texted my real 
one this morning to ask what we 
were doing this Friday night, the 
date we planned was identical to 
many we’ve had before. 
We agreed not to buy each 
other presents or expect them, 
both relieved not to shell out 
money on a student budget. 
For someone who loves cheesy 
romance so much, I was almost 
surprised at myself for being so 

happy just spending time with my 
partner without any of the glitter 
that the movies tell us to expect. 
I am in love, but not rom-com 
meet-cute love, not Hallmark 
love, not heart-candy love. Real 
love is something completely 
removed from all of that. 
In the almost six months 
since my partner and I have been 
together, we’ve been through a 
lot. But from his trials in grad 
school and finding a job to mutual 
health scares and interviews 
and periods where I didn’t leave 
the library for 10 hour periods, 
love was there the whole time. 
I never had that moment people 
talk about where all love songs 
start to make sense, and even 
watching movies like “Notting 
Hill” together has us talk more 
about the paparazzi in Britain 
and Julia Roberts’s teeth than our 
own relationship. Strangely, I feel 
the most love for him not in our 
greatest romantic gestures, not 
in the presents that we surprise 
each other with occasionally, 
but in the smallest, sometimes 
grossest, moments between us. 
When we’re brushing our 
teeth together in the morning, I 
feel it the most. Or when I do my 
skincare at night and I spray him 
surprisingly with my facial mist, 
when we walk hand-in-hand and 
I have to wipe my clammy fingers 
on my jeans before returning 
to his coat pocket. When I 
accidentally fall off the bed at 
night, when he bumps his head 
on our shitty Ann Arbor ceiling 
above the stairs, when he sends 
me random pictures of weird-
looking frogs because he knows I 
think they’re cute, I feel it. 
I believed for a very long 
time that I would never have a 
successful relationship — I am a 
fiercely independent person, and 
always have been. I am also a 
romantic who thinks she is in love 
with everything and anything 
she sees. I have never been shy 
about saying those three words. 
But real love doesn’t only show 
up for one day in February, it does 
when you’re least expecting it, as 
cliche as that sounds. It comes 
when you love someone enough 
to let them live parallel to you, not 
intertwined with each other. My 
first real Valentine’s Day doesn’t 
only live within 24 hours — the 
most beautiful thing is realizing 
that it doesn’t have to end.

A look at the best moments from the 2020 Oscars

Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” performance
Eminem performed his 2002 smash hit “Lose 
Yourself” at the Oscars Sunday night and I didn’t know 
why. I thought that maybe I had missed something 
crucial, like an introduction or any sort of rationale for 
what was happening. But I got none. And it took reading 
a CNN article days later to find some semblance of an 
explanation. 
Ever since the Academy made the decision to rid itself 
of a lead host, I’ve felt that something was missing. But 
it took me until this Eminem performance to figure 
out what that was. What’s missing is the cringe factor, 
something to laugh at that makes the ceremony more than 
a dreary procession of award-giving by hosts we see too 
little of to invest ourselves in. The absurdity of bringing 
“Lose Yourself” into 2020, let alone into the actual 
Academy Awards, along with the brilliant reactions from 
Billie Eilish, Idina Menzel and Martin Scorcese, reminds 
me of how seriously the Oscars has begun to take itself. 
And this performance, one that happens to be quite good 

in spite of how perplexing it is, is an exciting and welcome 
departure from this.

Timmy and his tracksuit
Timothée Chalamet wore a tracksuit to the Oscars. 
A Prada tracksuit, true, but a tracksuit nonetheless. 
Though not as radical a choice as that of Billy Porter, 
Chalamet still stood out among the traditional, therefore 
boring, tuxedos that other men in the industry tend 
to gravitate toward. With his athleisure red carpet fit, 
Chalamet delivered a look that received equal amounts 
of roasting and swooning on the internet. But, whatever 
you have to say about the look, it can’t be argued that 
it wasn’t sustainable — according to GQ, the Prada 
tracksuit was made of the fashion house’s Re-nylon 
material (a fabric made out of various recycled plastics 
and other ocean litter). The brooch was a borrowed, 
vintage Cartier accessory. So, regardless of the tracksuit’s 
popped collar as he presented an award, Chalamet was 
still photobombing Margot Robbie’s Oscars red carpet 
moment and, honestly, that’s the only thing that matters.

“Joker” wins best score
Despite the fact that I never saw “Joker,” Hildur 
Guðnadóttir’s winning Best Original Score was one of 
my favorite moments of the Oscars this year. Not only did 
she beat some incredibly talented and heavily-awarded 
nominees like John Williams and Randy Newman, but 
she was also only the fourth woman to ever win in this 
category. Her speech was probably my favorite of the 
entire night; it was short and sweet to the relief of many, 
I’m sure. But even more importantly, it was genuine and 
inspiring. As a teenage girl watching her, I couldn’t help 
but feel empowered. She left a message with the girls and 
women watching her, telling them to “speak up” because 
people need to “hear [their] voices.” Hearing those words 
was one of the only moments of the Oscars when I felt 
moved.

The Dernaissance
Laura Dern has been in the acting business for 
decades. While Dern reached national fame as the fiercely 
courageous Dr. Ellie Sattler in 1993’s “Jurassic Park,” 
she became more of a character actor in the decades 
afterward, known for taking obscure or supporting roles. 

Today, though, Laura Dern is one of the busiest, most 
visible actors around. The “Dernaissance” began in 2017, 
when she was the highlight of the Twin Peaks reboot, 
“Big Little Lies” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” While 
vastly different, these projects show Dern is one of the 
most discerning, reliable actors around.
In 2019, she returned for a second season of “Big Little 
Lies” and was the mother everyone wants in “Little 
Women.” To kick off 2020, she finally won an Oscar, 
recognizing her decades of stellar cinematic achievement. 
Now that she has that statuette, don’t expect her to 
slow down (rumor has it she’ll be in Jurassic World 3...). 
The Dernissance is upon us, and every film she graces 
with her presence is all the better for it. 
— Andrew Warrick, Daily Arts Writer

Bong and Scorsese
Bong Joon Ho, the inarguable winner of the night, 
gave several of the event’s best speeches. But the moment 
that resonates with me the most is his humble ode to 
Martin Scorsese during his Best Director speech.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
The U-M Jazz Fest is a surefire testament to passion

I’ve always been confused about why many believe 
jazz is old and boring. The University of Michigan Jazz 
Festival on Feb. 8 exemplified its ever changing nature. 
Various ensembles performed tunes old and new to the 
fascination of an audience comprised of all different 
ages. The event honored influential 1950s jazz trumpet 
player Clifford Brown, acknowledging the past while 
looking toward the future.
The first of the three main events of the day was 
a talk given by trumpet player Scotty Barnhart 
(featured guest of the day and current leader of the 
Count Basie Orchestra) and Music, Theatre & Dance 
Professor Ed Sarath on Clifford Brown. The small 
amount of attendees was engulfed by the large Stamps 
Auditorium. But rather than feeling like a birthday 
party that no one showed up to, Barnhart’s welcoming 
laugh and easy manner made the audience feel lucky 
to be small in number. He answered questions, told 
jokes and even jammed with a few trumpet students. 

Afterwards, he greeted members of the audience. The 
talk was emblematic of jazz: perhaps not as attended as 
it used to be, but warm, laid back and spontaneous.
Later that afternoon, the UM 
Lab Jazz Band took the same stage. 
Directed by Dennis Wilson (who 
also organized the festival), the 
group gave an impressive, mostly 
uptempo performance. Their fourth 
piece —“The Second Race” by Thad 
Jones — featured bassist Paul Keller, 
a local Ann Arbor big band leader. 
He and drummer Music, Theatre & 
Dance sophomore Mitchell Dangler 
spontaneously played with time on this 
tune, impressively slowing the quick 
tempo down to almost half speed as Keller soloed, then 
turning it back up again. One misstep, and the drummer 
and bassist, who held the time of the band, could lose 
their place and the whole song would fall apart.
“(Paul Keller) just came up and, during the song, 
before his solo, he was like, ‘I’m gonna slow down and 

then speed up. Follow me,’” Dangler said. “So that was 
fun, that was really fun.”
The last event, featuring the University Jazz Band 
and the Jazz Faculty Trio with Scotty 
Barnhart, was held in the glamorous 
Rackham Auditorium. “Leonardo’s 
Express,” performed by the U-M Jazz 
Band, emphasizing the compositional 
talent of student and split-lead trumpet 
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
junior 
Addison Tharp stood out to me. The 
players moved their bodies to the 
music, trumpet players accentuating 
their notes in the arch of their bodies, 
guitarist Music, Theatre & Dance 
sophomore 
Graham 
Helft 
visibly 
reacting in appreciation to various solos, all coming 
together in the surge of passion this piece created. 
“[We] always want to play student compositions… 
that’s really quite an undertaking, we just wanted to 
celebrate that,” said Ellen Rowe, band leader.
The day ended with a performance from the 

Jazz Faculty Trio, featuring Scotty Barnhart. They 
announced that they hadn’t rehearsed their fourth 
piece, “Our Love Is Here To Stay” by George Gershwin, 
but would see where it went. Bassist Ralphe Armstrong 
gave an almost theatrical performance of his solo, 
wiggling his eyebrows and dancing around the bass, 
causing the audience to cheer for him. Barnhart 
screeched out tricky high notes with perfect clarity, 
leaving the audience in astonishment.
Despite the fun, jazz is renowned as a boys’ club, 
and this time was, unfortunately, no different. The 
U-M Lab Jazz Band had one woman in it, on trombone, 
while the U-M Jazz Band had four women, each out of 
maybe 20 members. The Jazz Faculty Trio was entirely 
men. When asked about her experience as a female 
bandleader, Ellen Rowe gave a wry chuckle and said, 
“it’s challenging. It is very nice to have some women [in 
the band] … we really work hard to get women in the 
program.”

Friday, February 14, 2020 — 7A

Michigan, down to essentially 
six players, was still in it.
Sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon was out with an upper 
body injury suffered in the first 
quarter. Freshman guard Maddie 
Nolan tallied her fifth foul early in 
the fourth quarter. Senior guard 
Akienreh Johnson was battered 
and bruised. Freshman center 
Izabel Varejão hopped on one foot 
to the bench before coming back 
on.
And yet, the Wolverines were 
still in it against the No. 19 team 
in the country, Northwestern. 
Somehow, some way, they had 
limped their way into a tight 
fourth quarter, the win within 
reach.
Down by three with a minute 
left on the clock, the Wolverines 
got the stop they needed. Now, 
they had to devise a play to draw 
level with the Wildcats. Varejão’s 
mishandled pass blew it up, 
though, and freshman guard 
Michelle Sidor’s rushed shot 
painfully bounced on both sides 
of the rim.
The win slipped away, and 
despite the fight, Northwestern 
(21-3 overall, 11-2 Big Ten) beat 
Michigan (16-8, 7-6), 66-60.
“When you lose a player like 
Naz, everybody needs to do a 
little bit more,” Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said. “I think 
we tried to do that, but I think 
our freshmen kind of got exposed 
a little bit. They were freshmen 
and I think the other team was 
really experienced and their 
experience wore on our young 
kids. Especially late, especially in 
the third quarter.”
A hush fell on Crisler Center 
back in the first quarter as 
Hillmon, Michigan’s star, lay 
curled on the court, clutching 
her shoulder after colliding with 
another player going for a loose 
ball.

“I think it pissed us off. For 
sure it pissed me off because we 
were getting hacked,” Johnson 
said. “We just have to respond. 
We’re not the only team in the 
world that this has happened to. 
… We don’t make excuses. Each 
person that goes down is another 
opportunity for somebody to 
step up and to come and play for 
them.”
Shortly after Hillmon left the 
game, her replacement — Varejão 
— put the Wolverines in even 
further trouble by picking up 
two quick fouls. They were now 
down to two viable post players, 
junior forward Hailey Brown and 
sophomore forward Emily Kiser, 
the latter of whom has rarely 
played big minutes in big games.
Northwestern fought through 
its own personnel issues, with 
four players quickly racking up 
two fouls, including its most 
potent weapon in guard Lindsey 
Pulliam — who put up 32 points 
by herself in the last meeting.
At halftime, things looked 
up for the Wolverines. Hillmon 
ended the second quarter on 
the court, the Wildcats’ offense 
couldn’t find any success and 
Johnson was stepping up, making 
a series of improbable shots. 
Michigan went to break up, 35-30. 
“We did a great job of getting 
them all in foul trouble in the first 
half,” Barnes Arico said. “That 
really helped us when they’re in 
foul trouble.”
The second half was a different 
story for the Wildcats. Guard 
Sydney Wood, who averages 4.3 
points per game, caught fire and 
scored 10 in the third quarter 
alone. 
Forward 
Abi 
Scheid, 
another thorn in the Wolverines’ 
side from their last meeting, also 
found success out of the gate with 
nine points.
“When we lost Naz and we were 
in some foul trouble we had to go 
to zone and that gave them a little 
more flexibility to move around in 
that zone,” Barnes Arico said. “I 

thought that allowed them, too, to 
be more aggressive.”
Meanwhile, Michigan couldn’t 
get its offense rolling due to a 
plague of turnovers, including 
two pivotal ones late in the third 
quarter that gave Northwestern a 
wide open layup and 3-pointer to 
take a four-point lead. 
“I thought we got tired a little 
bit and we didn’t have anybody to 
really go to when our point guard 
needed a rest and she played a lot 
of minutes for us,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Some of our turnovers in 
that third quarter, we gave up 
a big third quarter, led to easy 
buckets for them.”
Midway through the fourth 
quarter, though, the Wolverines 
were still in it. Johnson drove 
down the court, hitting a big 
layup that roused a dormant 
Crisler Center and brought them 
within three. 
And then the Wolverines, 
swaying, missed their last-ditch 
shot and fell, coming oh-so-close.

Lindsey Pulliam is nothing 
short of explosive.
Entering 
Thursday 
night’s 
game, the Northwestern guard 
was second in the Big Ten in 
scoring, averaging 19.7 points per 
game. In the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s Jan. 30 loss to the 
Wildcats, Pulliam scored a season-
high 32 points, 22 of which came in 
the second half. She almost single-
handedly delivered the Wolverines 
an eight-point loss.
Over the two weeks since 
that 
loss, 
Michigan’s 
biggest 
challenge in preparing for the 
rematch was how to contain her. 
Without Pulliam’s dominance, the 
Wolverines felt that they could pull 
off their biggest win of the season.
From the start of Thursday’s 
game, the gameplan for defending 
Pulliam was clear: Don’t let 
her touch the ball. When she 
gets the ball, she doesn’t need 

much room to score — she can 
knock down fadeaway jumpers 
from almost anywhere on the 
court. In the loss two weeks ago, 
Michigan rarely let her get much 
separation, but she didn’t need 
it. She constantly knocked down 
improbable fadeaways to prevent 
the Wolverines from cutting into 
Northwestern’s second-half lead.
Senior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson, tasked with defending 
Pulliam on Thursday, was all over 
the place to keep the ball out of her 
hands. Any time Pulliam came to 
the top of the arc to receive a hand-
off from the point guard, Johnson 
did whatever she could to get a 
hand in and deflect the ball away. 
Many of the Wildcats’ possessions 
ended without Pulliam getting a 
touch.
“I studied her style of play for 
I think a week before this game 
… and one thing that I realized 
is when she gets the ball, either 
she’s gonna score it or she’s gonna 
draw a foul,” Johnson said. “So my 
intention this entire game, I didn’t 
care if I scored one single point, I 
was just keeping the ball out of her 
hands and making sure she wasn’t 
scoring.”
When she did get the ball, 
Michigan sent a double-team at 
her, often a forward. A second, 
bigger player coming at Pulliam 
threw her off just enough that 
she couldn’t knock down that 
fadeaway. She finished with just 
four points — none in the second 
half — on 1-for-10 shooting.
“I thought Akienreh Johnson 
did a fabulous job on (Pulliam),” 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico said. “I thought she was 
outstanding on her and really 
frustrated her early to the point 
that she kind of went away.”
But while Johnson shut down 
Pulliam, Northwestern still won, 
66-60, because the Wolverines’ 
offense struggled to generate 
anything in the second half. After 
shooting over 50 percent in the 
first half, Michigan shot under 35 

percent in the second. It turned 
the ball over 12 times in the second 
half, compared to just six in the 
first. The Wolverines couldn’t 
overcome the loss of sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon — their 
leading scorer — who went down 
with an upper body injury three 
minutes into the game. 
Michigan 
held 
it 
together 
without her early on, in large 
part to Johnson’s six first quarter 
points, and she returned early in 
the second. But midway through 
the third quarter, Hillmon came 
out after aggravating her injury 
and didn’t return. 
And her second absence took a 
toll on the Wolverines’ offense.
Playing the final four minutes 
of the third quarter without 
her, Michigan committed four 
turnovers and the Wildcats went 
on a 15-6 run to end the quarter, 
turning a 3-point Wolverines lead 
into a 6-point deficit.
In the fourth quarter, Michigan 
clawed its way back, tying the 
game with three minutes to go, but 
it was the Wolverines’ defense that 
got them back in it — they forced 
Northwestern to shoot 25 percent 
in the quarter. 
Michigan’s offense couldn’t get 
anything going despite its strong 
defense. The Wolverines often had 
to take low-percentage shots, and 
when they did score, it came late 
in the shot clock. After tying the 
game, they didn’t score again, and 
only scored 11 total points in the 
quarter.
“We got stagnant a little bit 
at 
times 
because 
(Hillmon) 
dominates the ball so much,” 
Barnes Arico said. “(Freshman 
center Izabel Varejão) tried to 
do that but she’s also a freshman 
trying to do what Naz has done and 
I think she had really good spurts, 
but she didn’t sustain the level that 
Naz can play at.”
Johnson did her part on Pulliam, 
but an unfortunate injury and a 
sluggish offense cost Michigan a 
game it easily could have won.

Bested and bruised

Wolverines exploit fast break in win

Franz Wagner wasn’t going to 
wait for anybody — not his fellow 
Wolverines and certainly not the 
backtracking Wildcats standing 
in his way. 
Having gathered the defensive 
rebound on one end, Wagner 
bobbed and weaved his way 
down to the other. As a final act, 
the freshman forward delicately 
ushered the ball off the glass 
and in while absorbing contact. 
With the possibility of a three-
point play upcoming, Wagner 
strolled off, puffing his chest out 
and gesturing to the Michigan 
bench, the Wolverines leading 
by 21 points. 
The sequence was just one of a 
slew of fast break opportunities 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
Wolverines 
during Wednesday’s 79-54 rout 
of the Wildcats. Whether it was 
a rim-rattling dunk by junior 
forward Isaiah Livers or a wide-
open 3-pointer from junior guard 
Eli Brooks, Michigan carved 
up 
Northwestern’s transition 
defense. By the end of the night, 
the Wolverines had scored 17 
fast break points — their highest 
tally since playing Iowa State in 
late November. 
While it’s easy to point to the 
fact that the lowly Wildcats — 
currently sitting in last place in 
the Big Ten with a 1-12 conference 
record — sit at 162nd in adjusted 
defensive efficiency according to 
KenPom, Wednesday night was 

a refreshing reminder of how 
potent Michigan can be on the 
break.
To 
this 
point, 
despite 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard’s 
fundamental 
insistence 
on 
pushing the pace, Michigan 
hasn’t quite been able to meet 
those 
expectations, 
ranking 
107th in possessions per game.
As shifty as the Wolverines’ 
guards are — namely senior 
Zavier Simpson and sophomore 
David DeJulius — Michigan’s 
transition 
offense 
was 
undoubtedly 
hampered 
by 
Livers’ 
nine-
game absence. 
With 
the 
victory 
over 
Northwestern, 
the Wolverines 
have 
now 
reached 
double-digit 
fast 
break 
points in ten 
games, 
Livers 
played in all but 
two of them. 
His willingness to run the 
floor and quick burst opens 
up lanes for Michigan’s ball-
handlers and gives them just 
another dynamic outlet to drop 
the ball off to. 
“When 
I 
was 
watching, 
sometimes it was sticky,” Livers 
said. “Coach Howard talked 
about the ball sticking. I feel like 
when I’m out there, I mean yeah, 
I try and get my shot because 
coach Howard tells me to be 

aggressive but also, I’m going to 
move the ball. When I’m at the 
top, I’m trying to orchestrate, I 
try to swing the ball to Eli for a 
three, get it to (Simpson) going 
downhill.”
Against the Wildcats, Livers’s 
presence was not only felt 
but heard. Disregarding any 
recollection of his recently-
injured groin, Livers spread 
his wings to flush home two 
monstrous dunks off transition 
feeds 
from 
Simpson 
and 
DeJulius. 
“Every time I run down the 
middle, Dave is always giving it 
back to me,” Livers said. “So I 
already knew. Let me run a little 
bit and see what (Northwestern 
forward Pete) Nance was going 
to 
do. 
He 
shadowed 
more 
towards Eli. I was there in my 
takeoff zone and went up off one. 
It’s exciting to get two dunks to 
finish a game without getting 
hurt.” 
The uptick in fast break 
opportunities for the Wolverines 
also stemmed from an increased 
workload for DeJulius when 
Simpson got in foul trouble. 
DeJulius, one of the quicker 
players on the team, accrued 
seven assists in 21 minutes 
as Michigan’s floor general, 
with 
five 
of 
them coming in 
transition.
“I’m naturally a 

scorer,” DeJulius 
said. “But that’s 
not really what I 
care about. I just 
care about doing 
whatever it takes 
for the team. Just 
to see that I got 
seven assists. To 
see guys get Isaiah the ball and 
he gets a dunk and he gets to 
yell, or me kick the ball to Cole 
(Bajema) and he gets a three. …
That feels good to me.”
It 
might’ve 
come 
against 
Northwestern, 
but 
the 
rare 
acumen the Wolverines showed 
on the fast break is definitely a 
welcome sight. 
For better or for worse, expect 
to see some more high-flying 
dunks from Livers and more 
flexing from Wagner.

Allan makes her presence known

Lou Allan wasted no time in 
Friday’s season opener. With 
two outs in the bottom of the 
first inning, the junior third 
baseman fired a ball deep into 
the right of center field and 
took off. 
It 
was 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first hit of the season and — 
after another big swing from 
sophomore infielder Morgan 
Overaitis — she scored the first 
run. 
But for Allan, it represented 
another first: The first time in 
her career that she’s been able 
to play in Michigan softball’s 
opening weekend. She spent 
most of last season in the 
dugout, recovering from a knee 
injury. 
“I 
thought 
she 
attacked 
(the injury),” Michigan coach 
Carol 
Hutchins 
said. 
“She 
couldn’t 
control 
the 
fact 
that she was hurt, she was 
highly 
disappointed, 
she’d 
fought through injury in her 
freshman year. I think it’s 
underestimated 
how 
much 
this can affect a kid who works 
all year and lifts weights all 
summer — you know, they put 
everything into this and it gets 
taken from them in a heartbeat.
“I 
was 
really 
impressed 

with how she responded to it, 
because all you can do is attack 
it. And she really did.”
Hutchins 
said 
she 
can’t 
even remember how Allan 
was playing before the injury. 
But it’s clear she’s leaps and 
bounds ahead of where she was 
at the end of last season. She’s 
stronger, her mobility is better 
and she’s faster. A couple 
months ago, it was unclear 
whether she’d 
be 
mobile 
enough to play 
defensively, 
but in January, 
Allan turned a 
corner. 
This 
weekend, 
she 
started 
every 
game on first 
base, and she 
showed 
the 
impact she can make in the 
infield. 
“She’s got a good glove, got 
a good bat — I mean, what 
can you say?” Overaitis said. 
“She brings a little toughness 
to the infield. She had a great 
weekend defensively. She had 
a lot of shots hit at her, so I 
think she’s a strong leader in 
the infield.”
But Allan’s biggest impact 
was at the plate. Last season, 
Allan got five hits in 19 at-bats. 

This year, she’s starting third 
in the lineup. And within this 
past 
weekend 
alone, 
she’s 
already matched last year’s 
hits in just 16 at-bats. 
In the season opener, she 
swung for a home run and a 
double, registering two RBI in 
the process. Against Florida 
the next day, she hit another 
homer and a single, picking up 
two more RBI. 
Despite 
the 
power in her bat, 
there 
are 
still 
places she needs 
to 
improve, 
as 
she went 0-for-
4 on the last day 
of the weekend. 
On 
the 
field, 
Hutchins wants 
her to get more 
mobile 
and 
quicker on the 
first step. But, for now, it looks 
like third in the batting order 
is exactly where Allan needs 
to be. 
“She is our most powerful 
hitter, but that doesn’t mean 
she’ll hit the most home runs,” 
Hutchins said. “We need to be 
able to hit through the middle 
of the order. We need our RBIs. 
Do I think she can do it? I 
think she can do it. I think they 
can all do it. It’s just a matter of 
whether they do it.”

Mel Pearson holds court every day 

after practice in his office at Yost Ice 

Arena.

Usually he talks about hockey.

But on Nov. 6, he was asked about his 

high school years, and another thought 

resurfaced: Susie, his wife, and how 

they met.

As he finished up his story about her, 

he got up from his couch and headed to 

the exit. While he put his hand on the 

door, another person walked through 

the entrance. All eyes turned to her.

“Here’s Mrs. Pearson!” Mel said.

It was a coincidence Mel’s wife was 

there, but he made the most of it.

“Here, they want to interview you,” 

Mel said. “This is my wife Susie. They 

want to know how we met in high 

school.

“ … I just told him you wouldn’t leave 

me alone.”

He didn’t wait for a rebuttal, instead 

opting to leave the room chuckling. She 

plopped in his empty seat and looked 

each person in the room in the eye. She 

smiled before asking a simple question 

that perked every ear.

“Do you really want to know the true 

story?”

 ***

Mel was from Flin Flon, Manitoba; 

Susie was from Atlanta. 

But the two of them moved around 

the country. Mel spent a large portion 

of his childhood shifting through Los 

Angeles, Baltimore and Portland. Susie 

stayed South in Atlanta with a brief stop 

in California before eventually ending 

up in a hockey town in Minnesota — 

Edina, where she and Mel crossed 

paths.

“It’s kind of a miracle that we even 

met,” Susie said.

The two of them were transplants 

due to their fathers’ work. 

Mel’s dad, also Mel, was a 

professional hockey player. The 

Pearsons had jumped from city to city 

due to his job — his last team was the 

World Hockey Association’s Minnesota 

Fighting Saints based in Edina. Upon 

getting cut, the elder Pearson decided 

the family should go back to Flin Flon 

for good. But Mel’s mother, Ruby, 

pushed to keep him in Edina for his 

education and hockey career, leaving 

him with a billet family and eventually 

the Andersons.

Instead of going back to Canada, he 

stayed in Minnesota, attending Edina 

East High School.

Susie’s dad accepted a job in St. Paul, 

Minn. at 3M the 

summer before Susie’s 

sophomore year in high 

school. Before they moved in, 

Susie’s parents researched good 

schools in the area. One, in particular, 

caught their eyes — Edina East, a half-

hour drive from St. Paul. Rather than 

buying a house closer to his job, Susie’s 

dad bit the bullet and took the long rides 

every morning so that his daughter 

could get a better education.

Instead of living in St. Paul, Susie’s 

family bought a house in Edina so she 

could attend Edina East.

And in study hall, the two of them 

met.

***

At Edina East, study hall was held 

either on the third floor of the library, 

or the study tables in the cafeteria. 

Normally, the sessions were split by 

class. Since Mel was a junior at the time 

and Susie a sophomore, they were split 

into different sessions. Mel spent a lot of 

time in the cafeteria, while Susie would 

be in the library. But he passed through 

the library every now and then, and she 

caught his eye.

“Here’s the true story,” Susie said. 

“He switched his study hall so that he 

could be in my study hall.”

Now sharing a period, he pulled out a 

chair one day and sat next to her, asking 

for help on an assignment. 

To her, he was a hockey player 

with an unmistakable look. He had an 

afro, a halo of red curls that extended 

several inches from his head, and wore 

bell bottom corduroys with clogs. He 

talked funny, but so did she. He had a 

Canadian accent, and she had a bit of a 

southern twang.

To him, she was a tennis player who 

was similar to him, new to the school. 

Most kids had their own cliques. They 

were the transplants.

“We sort of came together whether 

it’s fate as we were new kids on the 

block,” Mel said. “So she was a good 

looking young lady, and I was attracted 

to her.”

They gravitated toward one another. 

He found she had an infectious 

personality, and she thought he had 

the same. Moving around constantly, 

Mel learned how to be sociable. He was 

sarcastic but, at the same time, kind.

“That’s what kind of drew me to 

him,” Susie said. “If you look at him or 

just kind of the way he dressed and his 

hairstyle, he has a warm heart, and he 

always had a warm heart.”

Even though they clicked from the 

start, they didn’t start dating right away. 

In fact, Mel was with another girl at the 

time. But that relationship was already 

reaching its end. When Susie came into 

the picture, it was the start of a new 

story.

“How do you know that the love of 

your life is the person when you’re 15?” 

Susie asked. “But that’s kind of how it 

became obvious to both of us.”

***

When Susie’s dad first laid eyes on 

Mel, he didn’t like what he saw.

There were no cell phones back then, 

so to contact one another, Susie and Mel 

would just knock on the door.

Mel did that, and upon seeing him, 

Susie’s dad immediately disapproved. 

Her mom was more accepting. She was 

always the more kind and loving of the 

two. But her dad was a hardass, and 

frankly, Mel was scared. He had been 

nervous to meet him, and now that they 

finally met, Mel was off to a bad start.

“He basically said ‘I love my 

daughter, and I don’t know if you’re 

the right guy.’ or, ’You can’t fool me,’ or 

something like that.” Mel said

There was no warm welcome or 

“come back anytime.” Susie’s dad was 

protective. He drew the line and set 

ground rules. Mel appreciates that now 

that he has two daughters of his own 

and understands what her dad was 

trying to do, but at the time, he was 

anxious. 

Luckily, he didn’t have to see much 

of her dad. Susie’s dad traveled a lot for 

work, so instead, when he came over, 

he’d be greeted by just her mom. And 

she knew what was up — his frequent 

visits gave it away too easily.

But eventually, her dad warmed 

up to Mel, too. Susie noted he became 

Mel’s biggest fan. He just had to get to 

know the teenager first.

“Once (he) got to know me,” Mel 

said, “obviously I wasn’t that bad a guy.”

And while Mel would spend every 

holiday with the Andersons, his billet 

family, he would make an exception for 

one holiday. He spent Thanksgivings 

with Susie’s family.

“He did have the Anderson family,” 

Susie said, “but then he kind of quickly 

became a part of our family too.”

***

With a year difference, Mel 

graduated high school first and had 

already committed to playing hockey 

at Michigan Tech in Houghton. Susie 

stayed behind to finish high school.

The two of them knew what they 

wanted, though. 

They wanted to stay 

together, so they decided 

to not date anyone else.

When he could, Mel would 

try to see her. During school breaks, 

he would come back to Edina and 

stay with the Andersons. But John 

Anderson, his billet brother, knew the 

real reason Mel would return so often.

“We’d like to think that we really had 

a nice family,” John said. “But I think it 

was really Susie that kept him around.”

And whenever the Huskies played 

the University of Minnesota, Mel would 

break off from the team to try and get 

lunch with Susie, even if it was only for 

an hour or two — anything to catch up 

and spend time together. 

After Susie graduated high school, 

she attended Minnesota. Her parents 

paid for her first year, and so Susie 

and Mel’s permanent reunion was 

prolonged a year. But she didn’t 

know what she wanted to do. She 

did know, however, that she wanted 

to be with Mel. Both of them were 

tired of long distance. And upon Mel’s 

encouragement, after her freshman 

year, Susie dropped out from Minnesota 

and worked before moving up to 

Houghton to spend Mel’s last year there 

with him.

“We knew that we were the ones for 

each other, and it was getting kind of 

tiring to be apart,” Susie said.

It was a leap of faith. While Mel 

attended classes and played hockey, she 

worked at the bookstore. She moved in 

with a girl she had known from high 

school, the girlfriend of a teammate of 

Mel’s. Mel lived separately with two 

other teammates. But the two of them 

were fully committed.

And Mel made that clear the winter 

of his senior year.

He had thought about it for a while. 

The summer before school started, 

when he was still in Minnesota, he 

scouted for a ring and bought it. The 

decision was easy. He knew proposing 

was the right thing, but he was still a 

little scared.

“You’re nervous if she’s going to say 

yes or too young or whatever,” Mel said.

But she was ready for the 

commitment. And he was too. So when 

winter rolled around, he hid the ring 

in a medicine cabinet in his house, 

and she stumbled across it. It wasn’t 

picturesque or sappy; he didn’t get 

down on one knee. Mel jokes that’s how 

they teach it in Flin Flon, where they’re 

simple people. But it got the point 

across.

“It was not anything big and 

romantic,” Susie said. “But it didn’t 

downplay that it wasn’t a big deal.

“It would just seem like the natural 

progression. And I know it’s hard 

because we were still young, but we just 

knew we were the ones for each other.”

***

The summer before Mel’s senior 

year in college, before he and Susie got 

engaged, he went back to Flin Flon to 

spend time with his real family.

Flin Flon is a small town 500 miles 

north of Winnipeg, the nearest big city. 

Because it is so far north, the days seem 

to never end. The sunlight carries over 

until midnight, and comes back at 4 or 

5 a.m. It’s a scenic place that attracted 

some tourism. But above all else, it’s a 

mining town, and when Mel got back, 

naturally, he mined. 

Susie had pleaded with her parents 

to let her visit, and to her surprise, they 

agreed.

“I can’t really believe my parents let 

me do that,” Susie said. “Because, now 

that I’m a parent, I look back and think, 

‘Wow, they were kind of trusting but 

sent me on a plane.’ ”

Though she arrived and stayed for 

a couple weeks, Mel still had work 

at Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting 

Company. While he stripped away the 

zinc, sharpened drill bits in the steel 

shop, worked underground, she spent 

time with his mom and sister. Susie 

did get to see him during the day once, 

when she took a tour around the plant.

But it wasn’t really until after he 

got off work late that they were able to 

spend time together. 

And luckily for them, the days never 

got dark.

***

The fact that Susie could spend time 

with his mother, Ruby, that summer 

meant a lot to Mel. Ruby was a driving 

force in Mel’s life, determined for him 

to have the best. And like Susie, Ruby 

was outgoing and sweet, so when they 

met, they hit it off right away.

“It’s very important for me to meet 

all my family,” Mel said. “So it’s nice 

that she came up and met Ruby.”

Susie had moved to Edina after the 

Pearsons had moved back to Canada. 

They had met a couple times briefly in 

Minnesota, but that summer in Flin 

Flon, they really got to know her. And 

they adored her.

“I think they really enjoyed her, 

enjoyed her company,” Mel said. “And 

how could you not?”

Having

what we’ve uncovered is that 
there’s always more to learn. 

A kind word from a stranger

tiny love stories

I love like I season my dishes: 
intense, flavorful. I like to 
stir myself up like I stir my 
homemade leshta, churning my 
insides with made-up scenarios 
that burn like hot manja on the 
roof of my mouth. I am not a chef: 
I drop water-filled pots, mix 
the wrong ingredients, forget 
rice on the stovetop, watching 
it curl on its ends, charred and 
defeated. But I always start 
over, feeling hope between the 
gentle leaves of fresh spinach, 
and hearing whispers of good 
luck in the soft sifting of lentils. 
I am not a chef yet, simply a cook 
trying to master this intangible, 
frustrating, heartbreaking craft.

I

n Hebrew, the word for “to love” 
has the same root as the word “to 
give.” I’ve always admired the way 
an ancient language is woven together with 
purpose, the way the words hang on to each 
other, collide, twist into webs of meaning 
that say more together than any word could 
alone. 
To love and to give. This is what it looks 
like:
After six decades, my grandparents argue 
over what year they got married. One after-
noon at lunch, they interrupt each other as 
they tell me and my sister about that cold 
February, a month of love, a night in the 
stained-glass chapel. My grandpa emphati-
cally swings his corned beef sandwich in the 
air and insists it was the winter of ’58, a year 
of recession. They tell us about their first 
place together, a small townhouse on West-
brook in Detroit, near Six Mile. When my 
grandfather was in the Navy, my grandma 
wrote him letters every day. We talk about 
school and how my mother works too much. 
When we walk them to the car, my grandpa 
opens the passenger door and ushers his 
wife inside. 
In home movies, you never see my dad — 
he’s always behind the camera. On the day 
my twin sister and I were born, he points 
the lens at the two babies in my mother’s 
arms and says “Hi, girls” just like he did this 
morning on the phone. As we sort through 
old photo albums, I find a picture of him 
playing a baby grand piano — the gift my 
mom bought him when they got married. 
There are two babies in walkers on the floor 
— me and my sister — and our dog is perched 
at the window. I imagine my mom behind 
the camera, capturing in that instant what 
must have been everything: the sunlight, 
the music, the husband, the kids and the dog 
in the house they built to raise their family. I 
think of them now in the living room, sitting 
in quiet contentment at the end of another 
long day at work, wordless over the hum of 
the evening news of tragedy somewhere 
and cautious peace somewhere else. They 
are warm and together and lucky under the 
same roof.
How lucky am I to know what love looks 
like: the dreamy kind, the waterlogged and 
dusty wedding album, the woman in a deli-

cate white lace dress and the man in a black 
bowtie, wide-eyed, gazing at the camera. I 
know the hard kind, too: The day my grand-
ma swears she can’t live without my grandpa, 
tough doctor’s appointments and decisions to 
sell the house. The giving of everything — for 
better, for worse, till death do us part, he will 
make sure she gets home safely. Hundreds of 
letters sent back and forth, hundreds of phone 
calls. Maybe they sacrificed a lot, maybe she 
can’t stand the way he leaves toothpaste in 
the sink, and he hates how she bites her nails. 
Maybe it doesn’t always feel like love, when 
we let each other down, when we break a 
promise or forget to say thank you. Maybe 
we don’t love hard enough, or easy enough or 
right enough. 
But look at us, learning how to do it any-
way. On midnight at the rundown diner, I 
sit across from my best friend. We share a 
plate of fries and talk about our weekends. 
When I say we talk about our weekends, I 
mean we talk about the way we felt when he 
walked us home and didn’t kiss us goodbye; 
the way it’s been years since he called us a 
bitch but we still miss him; the way we felt 
euphoric and horrified at the idea of anyone 
seeing our naked bodies, our faces without 
make-up or reading what we might have to 
say about love. We lick the grease off our fin-
gers and say whatever we can: forget about 
him, or go for it, or I’m so sorry, or you are 
beautiful the way you are and that is not 
what love is, it can’t be. 
We talk about our parents and our sis-
ters and our family dinners where everyone 
fights and then makes up. We talk about the 
aging love of our grandparents and the fresh 
love of a newlywed sibling. We remind our-
selves we orbit around planets of this love, 
the unconditional kind, the kind we feel like 
we don’t deserve, the people who give us 
everything without asking for anything in 
return. 
What do we have to give? I want to give 
love as fiercely as I’ve received it. I won-
der what it takes to sustain half a century 
of marriage, what it means to see the man 
across the room and smile, to fall in love 
gently, if there is such a thing. Sometime 
when I was young, I learned you should love 
your neighbor as you love yourself, and at 
some point since then, I must have forgotten 

that means you have to love yourself first. 
That’s always been the hardest part, 
hasn’t it? Loving ourselves? My mom thinks 
I have bad taste in guys; I think I just can’t 
figure out how to look in the mirror and love 
the way my body curves, the way my lips 
form words, the way my hand curls around 
a pen to write, the way my mind shifts into 
bouts of worry, the way I’m silent in a crowd, 
the way I’m sometimes cruel, sometimes 
reckless, sometimes ungrateful for the love 
that is given to me. I hope that I’ll love better 
when I love myself. I hope that what I have 
to give will be enough. 
Right now, though, there is something so 
palpable about the love around me, some-
thing so promising and so heartbreaking. 

Across the table, my grandpa wraps his hand 
around my grandma’s fingers, and my sister 
kicks me under the table as if to say look at 
that, that’s love. We eat our sandwiches in 
comfortable silence, and I think of the shaky 
lens of a home movie, the camera zooming 
in on a younger version of my grandmother 
holding her newborn granddaughter, what 
a life it’s been, what words could never cap-
ture, what’s been given and taken and lost 
and loved.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 14, 2020

BY EMILY STILLMAN, DEPUTY STATEMENT EDITOR
This is what it looks like

PHOTO COURTESY OF EMILY STILLMAN


I 

have a box that has followed me 
from one childhood room to the 
next. When I was seven, it rested 
under my bed. At 10, it moved into a 
room upstairs with me and onto a closet 
shelf. When I was 17, it wedged itself 
into a corner between my dresser and 
the wall. Now, it just sits on my desk in 
my apartment. Sometimes I’ll run my 
hand over it in the morning, or I’ll open 
it up when hit by a wave of nostalgia. 
Inside it are love letters of different 
forms — full-length correspondences, 
notes scribbled on scraps of paper and 
cards. The letters have undoubtedly 
changed over the years. Elementary 
school valentines were ousted by notes 
from my high school friends. A card 
from my parents for my 
fourteenth birthday was 
replaced with one from my 
nineteenth. 
They are from classmates, 
friends, 
my 
brothers, 
family, old partners and 
new ones. Each of these 
letters is signed with love, 
and each person who has 
written a note is someone 
I once loved, or still do, in 
return. Even though the 
love I feel for my aunt is 
different from the love I 
feel for my best friend; the 
love I felt for my tenth-
grade boyfriend is different 
from the love I feel for 
my current one; the love 
I felt for my high school 
teammates is different than 
the love I feel for my older 
brother, I still tell them all 
the same thing: I love you.
But the more love I 
experience, 
the 
more 
frustrating it is to realize 
that it is, quite frankly, impossible to 
express the nuances of my love in words. 
We are complex enough to notice the 
slight differences in the love we feel 
for our mother versus for our father, 
yet our words are not complex enough 
to describe those feelings — at least in 
English.
I am not bilingual. I was raised in 
an English-speaking home by English-
speaking parents in English-speaking 
cities with English-spoken “I love 
you’s.” But last December, at a small 
table in the back Chela’s on South 
Fifth Ave, my friend Maggie, who 
grew up speaking Bulgarian, raised 
the question between bites of her taco 
bowl: What if our options for saying 
“I love you” in our native languages 
affect our ability to express — or even 
fully feel — love?
It’s not necessarily a new question, 
or at least the part which posits 
that different languages affect how 
we think and act. Linguists and 
neuroscientists have been asking it for 

decades, and even though it is widely 
debated and hard to prove, it does have 
a name: linguistic relativity, or the 
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, proposes that 
the language we speak fundamentally 
affects how we think, act and perceive 
the world around us.
In one famous experiment, Russian 
speakers and English speakers were 
shown multiple slides, each with three 
blue squares — one on top and two on 
the bottom, in a pyramid shape. Two of 
the squares were the same shade of blue, 
and the third was slightly different. 
The study found that Russian speakers 
were better at quickly discriminating 
between the two shades of blue. 
This, 
the 
researchers 
proposed, 

was because Russian makes linguistic 
distinctions between lighter shades 
of blue and darker ones. Essentially, 
Russian speakers’ cognitive ability to 
identify blue was different from English 
speakers’ ability simply because their 
language has more words to categorize 
the color than English does.
As interesting as it is, being able to 
process colors a little more quickly 
is much different than experiencing 
love in an entirely different way. But 
the opposing view to linguistic relativity 
provides no more comfort: It argues 
that what we experience and perceive 
as culturally important are what we 
put into our language. It would mean 
that English speakers feel less of a need 
to express the nuances, emotions and 
complexities of love since there’s only 
one way to say “I love you” in English. 
That’s just not the case.
Actually, 
it 
seems 
that 
in 
the 
United States, love is everywhere. 
Another 
study 
at 
Baruch 
College 
interviewed dozens of people about 

the use of the phrase “I love you” in 
their various cultures and languages. 
Almost every subject who did not grow 
up with American culture — but instead 
with Korean, Guyanese, Romanian or 
Jamaican cultures, respectively — told 
researchers that their cultures used the 
term “I love you” much less often than 
Americans did.
The 
reasons 
they 
gave 
for 
not 
overusing the phrase were similar: 
Using “I love you” too often detracts 
from its importance; “I love you” is so 
meaningful that you’d only say it to 
someone you intend to marry; saying 
“I love you” before you really mean it is 
shallow.
The phrase is used so generously in 

American culture — especially when the 
year nears Feb. 14 — that I sometimes 
feel it lacks the meaning I want it to have 
when I say it and really, really mean 
it. But what does that say about our 
culture? Are we simply eager to love, or 
is the depth of our love compromised by 
our fervor to feel it? Are other cultures 
somehow more earnest in their ability to 
love?
Seeking to sate some of my curiosity, 
I spoke to a few bilingual people. The 
first was my former Spanish professor 
Wendy Gutierrez-Tashian.
Wendy is from Lima, Perú and teaches 
Spanish in the Residential College. The 
first time I met her was on the first day 
of my freshman year. She speaks quickly 
and with lots of emotion, so I have vivid 
memories of her giving instructions and 
greeting me at the speed of light in a 
language I couldn’t yet comprehend. I 
ended up making it through her Spanish 
class OK, and the conversation we had 
together in Amer’s last week was one of 
our first in English. 

The two main love phrases in Spanish 
are “te quiero” and “te amo.” And 
although they translate pretty well 
to “I love you,” Wendy explained the 
difference to me as “te quiero” as being 
used more often for parents, children 
and friends. In contrast, she says, “For 
me, it’s more emotional to say ‘te amo’ 
because that means that I cannot love 
you more than that — I have reached the 
top of my love.”
But 
“te 
amo” 
is 
not 
reserved 
specifically for romantic relationships 
(although this is the context when it 
is most often used). Instead of being 
expressly romantic, Wendy told me 
“te amo” communicates an incredibly 
powerful, deep kind of love which “te 
quiero” does not.
She 
also 
added 
that 
“te quiero mucho,” “te 
quiero 
muchísimo,” 
“te 
amo mucho” and “te amo 
muchísimo” each convey 
varying depths and levels of 
love, with “te amo mucho” 
and “te amo muchísimo” 
expressing 
something 
Wendy describes as being 
“beyond love.”
She says these linguistic 
differences are apparent 
in behavior as well: “In 
Perú, it’s just normal for 
people to kiss when they 
greet but (in the United 
States), it’s just very subtle 
and transactional and it 
shouldn’t be like that. In 
Latin America it’s not like 
that — you see a friend and 
you hug, you really hug, 
and they don’t let you go.”
There is one culture in 
particular in which people 
show 
their 
love 
almost 
explicitly, as opposed to vocalizing 
it: Japanese. I talked to Engineering 
sophomore Kilala Ichie-Vincent. Over 
the past month, I’ve noticed a few 
things about Kilala: She likes to cook, 
especially with chili oil. Holding her 
hair back from her face are always four 
hair clips, which she color coordinates 
with a vintage sweater or a chic pair 
of denim cargo pants. She’s passionate 
about design and creation, and she’s 
hoping to transfer to the architecture 
school.
Kilala was raised by a Japanese 
mother and Black father in Queens, New 
York. She grew up speaking Japanese 
with her grandparents, visiting them in 
Tokyo and other parts of Japan, but she 
was always trying to balance this with 
being an American kid, teenager and 
then young adult in New York City.

Tiny Love Stories

Jacob threatens to order a pizza nearly every night but 
almost never follows through. We rarely share a meal that 
doesn’t send him into some vague gastrointestinal pain, 
except the sushi we once ate in a Toledo, Ohio bathtub (“I 
didn’t know sushi could be, like, a meal”). He once mused 
on the concept of chicken-fried steak to me for half an 
hour, then vowed to order it from every menu that offers it. 
He sends me a picture each time, an indecipherable sort of 
meat slathered with glue-colored gravy. “This will give me 
pain,” he usually says. 

Verity Sturm, Statement Correspondent

 

Chicken-fried feeling

One Sunday at the deli, my grandparents argue over 
what year they got married. My grandfather insists it 
was 1958, in the winter. My grandma says, “No Howard, 
it was 1960, the year Kennedy was elected.” They agree 
it’s impossible that all these years have passed. Look at 
this family we built. Look at these grandchildren. When 
my mother calls my grandfather, hoping he’ll accept help 
caring for his wife, he declines with pride. It is our job 
to take care of each other, he says. What a love that lasts 
through the years. What a love that transcends memory, 
that just comes to be.

Emily Stillman, Deputy Statement Editor

Sunday at the Deli

I am one minute older than my brother. I existed on 
Earth for 60 seconds before he decided to join me — slow 
poke. Some twins might recount this story with bitterness, 
upset that their sibling stole the birthday spotlight, but not 
me — not us. Alexander and I work as a team; we always 
have. He knows that I secretly enjoy the dumb texts he 
sends me, including the time he crashed my computer 
by pasting 100,000 heart emojis in one message, and he 
knows how to give me a real hug when I need more love 
than an emoji can send.

My (literal) other half

Running into the coffeehouse — book bag open, hair 
stuck in my mouth — I blurted out an apology: “Sorry I’m 
late, I’m coming from the courthouse … A protective order 
… it’s fine,” I tried to reason. His eyebrows scrunched with 
annoyance, softened into concern. He was at a loss for 
words, I assumed he felt awkward. Most people did. But he 
tried to comfort me: “Don’t worry, I’ll handle the project.” 
After an hour of coffee and laughs, I left lighter than I’d 
felt all week. A year later, I found my way back to him. I 
still run late, and he’s still taking care of me.

Julia Fanzeres, LSA and SMTD senior

Our first meeting

I love like I season my dishes: intense, 
flavorful. I like to stir myself up like I stir my 
homemade leshta, churning my insides with 
made-up scenarios that burn like hot manja on 
the roof of my mouth. I am not a chef: I drop 
water-filled pots, mix the wrong ingredients, 
forget rice on the stovetop, watching it curl on 
its ends, charred and defeated. But I always 
start over, feeling hope between the gentle 
leaves of fresh spinach, and hearing whispers 
of good luck in the soft sifting of lentils. I am 
not a chef yet, simply a cook trying to master 
this intangible, frustrating, heartbreaking 
craft.

Editor

Cook, not chef

Ty and I were never supposed to meet. 
He grew up homeless in New Jersey, while 
my Michigan suburb bubble-wrapped me in 
privilege. He’s Afro-Latino and I’m white. We 
met studying abroad in Costa Rica, where he 
taught me to dance bachata, and I taught him 
to play ukulele. Having escaped the social 
structures keeping us apart in the United 
States, we quickly fell in love. Six months, 
two countries and three states later, learning 
is still our constant. As we unwrap the layers 
of our opposite worlds, cycles of poverty 
and privilege, what we’ve uncovered is that 
there’s always more to learn. 

Hannah Brauer, Statement Columnist

From opposite worlds, united abroad

A kind word from a stranger on the walk 
to class. Finding out someone loves that book 
and author, too. The sound of their laugh — 
pure, spontaneous, an accident that almost 
didn’t happen. A shared copy of “All The 
Light We Cannot See.” Thin upstrokes and 
downstrokes: calligraphy pen against paper. 
Pale blue hand-me-down picnic blanket on 
dewy grass, soft. Running to catch the sunrise 
even though you have already captured a 
thousand more. Twirling the curls in their 
hair, wanting them for myself. Firecrackers, 
the lingering smell of incense hanging in the 
air, a flickering spark in the darkness.

Quinna Halim, LSA freshman

A (tiny) list of things I love:

No more are the days I would meticulously record each 
calorie I ate, the days I would cry over the extra weight 
on my thighs. Long gone is that Sunday in March when I 
landed in the hospital from a self-induced iron deficiency. 
Now I eat to my heart and stomach’s content, a symbolic 
thank you to my strong legs for carrying me from class 
to class and through mediocre self-choreographed swing 
dancing routines on a Friday summer night. Today, I love 
my every stretch mark, curve and dimple of my imperfectly 
perfect being. In my twenty years, this is the greatest love 
I have yet to know.

Anonymous

The greatest love

Homemade leshta, before being drowned in paprika.

Love that lasts longer than lifetimes.
On a trip to Traverse City over fall break.
Sharing a plate of sushi, not in a bathtub this time.

At a dance club in Costa Rica.
Add making art to the list of things to love.

Two baby bundles are better than one.
A moment of freedom, strength and happiness.

“Love Island”: The Walden Pond of reality TV

T

V has always moved too fast for 
me. I was too busy running track 
and selling books in high school 
to participate in my nuclear family’s 
“Breaking Bad” bonding routine, I gave 
up on “Twin Peaks” after distractedly 
missing too many plot points and I figured 
that everyone else knew enough about 
“The Office” and “Game of Thrones” for 
me to ride on their collective coattails. 
Last spring, my roommate and I vowed 
to get through season 1 of “Killing Eve”, 
only to abandon ship in the middle of its 
finale, broadly complaining that television 
demanded too much from our specific 
brand of attention span. We preferred 
reading. Crossword puzzles. Knitting 
with the cat on the lap. Things that were 
… slower.
So I went through a bit of an identity 
crisis when, at the end of last semester, I 
found myself watching the 2015 British 
reality dating show “Love Island” for five 
hours straight with my skinny musician 
friends, people who usually put on 
something between high cinema or the 
short film they shot and edited themselves 
earlier that day. How or why it started 
playing remains a mystery, but we were 
inexplicably hooked from the first lens 

flare and dramatic muscle shot. 
The premise of “Love Island,” especially 
to a group unacquainted with reality 
television, is inane. In the season opener, 
ten sexy-ass Brits are separated by gender 
and essentially paraded in front of each 
other one by one; a pageant that ends with 
the awkward and cheeky heteronormative 
“coupling” of birds and lads that express 
varying levels of mutual interest upon 
first impression. They are (ironically) 
isolated from reality for nine weeks on a 
luxe compound in Mallorca known fondly 
as “The Villa” to test, temper, break and 
re-break the bonds they initially formed 
— almost none of which last more than a 
week. 
Couples sleep side-by-side in an open-
room line of king beds, summer camp-
style. They have no phones, computers 
or means of connecting with the world 
outside the Villa. There is a pool, an 
open bar and a few dumbbells thrown 
on a makeshift workout lawn. If you’re 
single by the time of the next (dreaded) 
“recoupling,” you’re out. A relationship 
means survival, plain as day. Let the 
cameras roll.
Alyssa Schmid, a senior studying 
sociology in LSA, doesn’t know why she 

likes it either. 
“There isn’t even really a plot it feels, 
most of the time they’re just sitting in 
their bathing suits around the pool,” 
Schmid told me last week in the back 
corner of Espresso Royale State Street. 
She got into “Love Island” through her 
roommate, tackled the first three seasons 
and successfully converted her sister to 
the cause. She follows multiple previous 
contestants on Instagram.
“... and this doesn’t make any sense to 
me. They put them in a situation where 
it’s obviously not reality, and then it’s just 
them being themselves ... but you can’t 
talk to anyone (from the outside world) so 
I guess it kind of makes sense,” she added. 
“Like, you have a totally different life 
now, you have to make friends and build 
relationships because you’re not going to 
have anyone else to talk to for however 
long you’re there. Literally nothing else to 
do.”
Ayat AL-Tamimi, a senior in LSA 
studying political science, finds that these 
interactions-by-necessity often challenge 
what you’d normally expect from “love”-
seeking reality TV like the infamous 
“Bachelor.” In fact, it’s what excites her 
about the show.
“The goal is to be in a relationship 
that goes to be the couple that wins the 
money, and so maybe you have to find 
people that you can vibe with, just on a 
platonic level, to be paired up with for a 
little while,” she explained. This is where 
“Love Island” makes its major break from 
the norm: the premise isn’t to land one 
specific relationship with one specific 
person. It’s multidimensional in the Villa 
— a relationship, a person. You could, in 
theory, win by spooning with a friend.
Earlier in our interview AL-Tamimi 
used 
the 
term 
“strategic 
coupling” 
to 
describe 
this 
common 
Island-
phenomenon: coupling with a pal to the 
mutual interest of evading elimination. 
Social symbiosis.
“What I really appreciate is how a lot of 
them will come to mutual understanding 
of, ‘we don’t like each other that way, I 
fully support you going to find someone 
that you think you might be romantically 
invested in.’ But it’s not killing the 
friendship, so in a way it’s much like the 
antithesis of other dating shows where 
it’s a cold, one-track, have-to-be-in-love 
sort of trajectory, which statistically is not 
realistic at all,” AL-Tamimi said. 
The lines indeed blur. There’s a 
moment in season three where contestant 
Montana, strategically coupled up with 
Marcel, invites Marcel’s new flame Gabby 
into their bed to surprise her man with 
a good-night kiss. Three people end up 
sharing this moment: Marcel, surprised; 
Gabby, literally crawling over Montana 
to smooch him and Montana herself, 
smiling supportively next to her friends. 
This seems more organic than the rigid, 

elimination-controlled monogamy of “The 
Bachelor.” This seems like something that 
has happened on the couch in my living 
room
“So technically yeah, your worth is 
determined by whether you’re coupled or 
not, but that plays with it in a lot of ways,” 
AL-Tamimi explained. “It’s not like you 
have to be romantically coupled to share 
a bed with someone. There are a lot of hot 
men and hot women sharing a bed and 
nothing happening … And I think that’s 
kind of subversive.”
I

n the spring of 2017 I, like many 
confused 
writers 
before 
and 
after me, departed Ann Arbor in 
the direction of New Hampshire and 
the New England Literature Program 
(NELP). NELP is one of the more unusual 
experiences available at the University 
of Michigan: six weeks, forty strangers, 
upwards of twenty literary texts and 
something around five overnight hiking 
trips in the woods of the White Mountains. 
NELPers dwell in a boys’-camp-made-
commune 
on 
the 
picturesque 
Lake 
Winnipesaukee, cooking and cleaning 
for each other in scheduled work shifts. 
There are no phones, computers or means 
of connecting with the world outside the 
camp — all NELPers have are Emerson, 
Thoreau and each other.
I’ve never held NELP and reality TV 
in the same thought before — NELP 
touts itself as a deeply intellectual and 
introspective experience, while “Love 
Island” comes off as oversaturated, 
overstimulating sensationalism. But while 
interviewing for this piece it dawned on 
me that perhaps I vibe with “Love Island” 
because I did something somewhat similar 
three years ago in rural New Hampshire. 
Despite their aesthetic differences as an 
immersive academic program and a reality 
dating show, NELP and “Love Island” 
share enough of a structural skeleton to 
produce mirroring social effects. I mean, 
if you drop a group of strangers anywhere 
in the world, circumscribe them within 
a radius and sever all contact from the 
lives they had just left, weird things will 
happen. What Schmid said was true: All 
you can really do is sit around and talk to 
each other, whether that be in a bikini by 
the pool or in layers of thermal clothing 
on a rock in the woods. In the process, 
everyone seems to become a character, 
in the best and worst of ways. You have 
little to share aside from who you think 
you are and what you think is going on, 
resulting in what feels like constant 
commentary on self and selves. There’s 
disproportionate space for unexpectedly 
personal and confessional conversation, 
equal parts awkward and thrilling.

O

ver Winter Break, my mother and I drove 90 
minutes to visit the gravesite of my paternal 
grandmother Gail, a place neither of us had seen. 
We drove around the cemetery in dizzy circles and tra-
versed plots of well-kept grass to find it, searching the site 
with only a rough draft of a map found online. I’d always 
wanted to visit the site and finally my mother decided she 
would be the one to take me, driven by her desire to share 
this moment with me and her personal curiosity. My father 
politely declined our invitation to join us, smiling at us with 
an air of vulnerability, as his mother is a sensitive topic that 
pains him to bridge. He lost her when he was young. My 
mother and I never had the chance to meet her. 
When we’d finally made it, I stood over the dark slate and 
fixed my watery eyes on the birth date: February 14. The day 
my grandmother’s mother brought her into this earth was 
a day filled with love letters, hand holding and chocolate 
hearts. This was a day she celebrated with birthday cake, 
friends and family. A day that marked another year. A day 
she eventually spent with my father. A day full of love — not 
just to and from her, but everywhere.
“This is closest I’ve ever been to her,” my mother mut-
tered to the ground through scattered tears. “And the clos-
est I’ll ever be.” I gripped her hand, my other hand curled 
around my grandmother’s gold coin necklace dangling from 
my neck, my eyes fixated on the “2/14” deeply engraved into 
the glossy stone. 
Back on my 13th Valentine’s Day, my mother pulled me 
aside at the breakfast table. “Valentine’s Day was your 
father’s mother’s birthday. Make sure you give him a hug 
today and tell him you love him,” she said, cutting into the 
pink pancakes my father had made us for breakfast. I had to 
pause. I noticed the way she didn’t say “your grandmother,” 
because I would immediately think of her mother, a woman 
I knew, and not my father’s mother, a woman I never had 
the chance to meet, who died before I was born. Perhaps 

my parents mutually thought the information of her 
birthday to be trivial, but I weighed on every word. My 
paternal grandmother Gail was an Aquarius. That was 
something I now knew. 
My 13th Valentine’s Day was also my freshman year 
of high school. The boy who stole my first kiss the previ-
ous summer surreptitiously got my locker combination 
from my friends and unlocked it on a clandestine mis-
sion before school. His goal? To be my valentine. Right 
before the first bell rang, I bounded through a hallway 
of lively, hormonal 13-year-olds to my locker to switch 
out my books. Instead, out of my locker tumbled a teddy 
bear, chocolates, pink balloons, heart shaped decor and 
a deck of cards, which in sloppy handwriting read: 52 
things I <3 about you. 
My face burned as I struggled to push the over-the-
top gifts back into my locker, forfeiting the idea I’d find 
my science binder under all of the pink glitter and heart-
shaped chocolate boxes. I couldn’t pinpoint the embar-
rassment; perhaps it was because this boy wasn’t my 
boyfriend, or because I was at an age when embarrass-
ment is common and blending in is much preferred to 
attention. As I finally slammed my locker shut, its rusted 
door bursting with pink streamers, I turned around and 
ran directly into him. Our eye contact was momen-
tary, and I opened my mouth as though I was going to 
say something, but instead took off in the other direc-
tion, leaving him standing there, valentine rejected and 
alone. 
The Valentine’s Days to follow were similarly unsuc-
cessful. During my junior year of high school, my then-
boyfriend dropped a teddy bear off at my house but asked 
me if it would be OK if he “please went to hang out with his 
friends.” My senior year of high school, my then- “kind of” 
boyfriend gave me an assortment of things (a single half-
wilted rose, a mini box of chocolates) he’d just purchased 
from a drug store. For both freshman and sophomore year 
of college I wore a heart-shaped sweater and ate sushi with 
my best friend at 4 p.m., long before any lovebirds would 
fill the two top tables at the restaurants. I’m not ashamed 
to say we followed the sushi by watching the Fifty Shades 
of Grey saga and eating heart shaped Reese’s peanut butter 
cups. We laughed until our stomachs hurt, and then both 
cried in the darkened theatre during the previews, lament-
ing over recent ex-boyfriends. Those were my best Valen-
tine’s Days yet. 
Regardless, I have always had a strange affinity for the 
holiday. Normally I’d reserve “fans of Valentine’s Day” for 
those in happy, committed or new honeymoon-phase rela-
tionships with plans to drink fizzy cocktails and hold hands 
— not the singles who are without sappy memorabilia or 
someone to buy them valentine peanut M&Ms. But there’s 
something about Valentine’s Day that I love, even as I am 
happily single and enjoying my final semester on campus 
boyfriend-less. Maybe it’s the Cancer sun or Cancer moon 
in me. Maybe it’s my love for poetry and the wonderfully 
dizzying idea of romance. Or maybe it’s because I have a 
strong affinity for the color pink and any excuse to eat choc-
olate. The truth is, though, I love Valentine’s Day because 
the whole world is somehow celebrating my grandmother’s 
birthday through their sappy love notes and flower arrange-
ments, even if they don’t know it. 
When I was growing up, my father and his brother would 
say they thought I looked like “Grammy Gail.” I was com-
pared to the childhood pictures we had from her yearbooks, 
and it irked me that I’d never know the woman everyone 
who knew her so strongly linked me to. Maybe it’s the name-

sake — Eli Gail — but after a childhood of being told I don’t 
really look like anyone in the family, I was relieved to have 
someone I took after, even if it was someone I didn’t know. 
I spent my young adulthood wondering my way in and 
out of Gail’s life, creating a caricature of her in my mind. I 
imagine her charismatic and flirtatious yet loyal and true. 
The inkling to know her is inexplicable and frustrating. In 
my journal I write lists of the things I know about Gail. It’s 
always a short list. Sometimes, next to the lists, I write out 
the things I know of myself.
When I was growing up, my father never spoke of Gail. 
All stories and memories were padlocked behind my father’s 
averted gaze whenever her name was mentioned. In my 21 
years, I’ve collected facts about her and held them close: 
She was a Jewish woman who died of breast cancer, with 
a spitfire personality and a heart too big for this world, and 
she left behind a collection of gold coins of various sizes that 
hang in my mother’s closet and around my neck. I’m not 
sure where the rest of her things are. My father was never 
willing to tell me or my family any details about his mother’s 
life and we never asked. I always assumed this was because 
it was too painful to dredge the emotional past to speak of 
the days when she was around. 
I’ve always been infatuated by Gail in a clandestine way, 
worrying that it’s inappropriate to have such nostalgia for a 
woman I’ve never met, who everyone speaks of scarcely yet 
with vulnerability and affection. On a few separate occa-
sions I convinced my father to speak of her. Once, I was eat-
ing breakfast with my dad and I mentioned I wanted to see 
Greece before I died. He stopped what he was doing, a fork-
ful of egg suspended in the air and said, “My mother loved 
Greece.” I was so caught off guard by the casual nature of his 
comment that I didn’t respond. He commenced eating his 
eggs and said nothing else. Perhaps if I’d followed up with 
another question about Greece or his mother, we could’ve 
had some riveting, life-affirming conversation about her. I 
didn’t, because that wasn’t my relationship with my dad — 
it isn’t my relationship with my dad. We don’t dredge emo-
tional vats of our pasts in search of answers. And I wasn’t 
used to him ever saying the words “my mother.” 
I will never know my grandmother. I’ll never hold her 
hands. I’ll never learn about my Jewish heritage from her 
or hear her voice. She’ll never attend my graduation or one 
day, my wedding. But Valentine’s Day is her day. Despite 
my romantic mishaps, being single or feeling alone on the 
Valentine’s Days of my past, Feb. 14 has always been more 
than the acknowledgement of romance. Valentine’s Day 
manifests itself as a different kind of celebration for me — a 
love for my mother, a woman committed to bridging the gap 
between myself and my heritage; my father, who has been 
my best friend since birth; and my grandmother, a woman I 
know watches over me, though we’ve never met face to face. 
But a part of her will always be here: in my father, in the 
gold coin necklaces, in the stories we barely tell, in me. With 
the onset of the February sun and the days edging toward 
Valentine’s Day — a day a single person would typically 
loathe — I think about my grandmother, my sweet, uncom-
mon Valentine, a woman whose life began on a day filled 
with affection and infatuation. 
As I approach this Valentine’s Day, writing from the last 
bedroom I will ever have in Ann Arbor, before my life sup-
posedly begins, I’ve recognized that my singleness and lack 
of a valentine isn’t so lonely. It is in the span of the past year 
that my grandmother and I have somehow grown closer. 
She is my valentine, on a skinny chain around my neck — 
all the way from wherever the best people go — somewhere 
near the sun.

On Valentine’s Day, I think of my Grandmother

To my handsome prince, math genius, 
and knight in shining armor: I’m the 
luckiest girl in the world. Thank you for 
the endless notes, surprises and 5 a.m. 
nights with me. It’s safe to say that 
reality with you is better than my dreams 
(#^.^#)
To my scooter buddy, fashion icon, and 
literal other half: I’m eternally thankful to 
have gotten so close to you. Our endless 
laughs, chaotic energy, and late night 
talks mean the world to me. I’m so lucky 
that you’re in my life :)
Julia is amazing. She fights for what she 
believes is right and faces all of life’s 
hurdles. She’s on a waffle tour, but don’t 
forget she’s gonna change the world.

from your TheOrdinary serums. I long to 
smell lingering scents from your 3-wick 
Bath and Body Works candles. I regret the 
day I failed to tell you...you don’t deserve 
rights.

too cute to handle. You make heart fast

spin like a Flywheel and make me say 
MagYum. Im so happy we’re in this zone

She’s got a lot that I don’t, and I know you 
love her. But you can’t deny our chemistry, 
it’s definitely good enough. Everything you 
need is right here, literally; we already live 
together. Be mine, Jake.
Davis, you’re not my dad. Love, Ellie
It’s weird to think that we’ve only been 
together for a year and half. It’s honestly 
hard to remember what my life was like 
without you in it. You’re the best part of 
every day. I can’t wait to write another one 
of these for you next year. 
“Michael! Happy Tame Impala album release 
date! And Valentine’s Day ;) Love ya! - Anna”
I spent the first 20 years of my life 
searching for love. I eventually decided 
to give up; I wasn’t destined for love. 
Immediately after that, I met him. Our souls 
have been connected ever since. Love will 
find you at the most unexpected moment. 
Despite my name being frustratingly 
unconventional, it has made you one of 
the most important individuals in my life 
#iykyk. I thank your parents for your name, 
and you for being you. I love you Chokshi.
Hey Salams MSA President, I’ve been 
wanting to talk to you and let you know I’ve 
really gotten to like you over the past year. I 
never had the courage to tell you in person. 
If you’re interested come looking for me.
I didn’t want to disturb you so I never told 
you that I had a crush on you (and I still like 
you, sigh). Pls don’t try to guess who I am. 
Thank you for being the reason I smile (and 
take more stats classes this term). I wish 
you a happy life :)

you’ve stuck around every day since. I am 
so lucky that you’re my friend. Here’s to
