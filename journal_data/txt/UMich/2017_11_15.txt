When 
LSA 
sophomores 

Rebecca Bernstein and Andie 
Harris 
received 
a 
problem 

set back from their Stats 250 
graduate student instructors, 
their grades were a shock: They 
both received zeros.

Emails from their respective 

instructors 
explained 
their 

respective homeworks were too 
similar to those of their friends 
in the class. While the lowest 
homework grade is dropped, 
the sharp reprimand confused 
Bernstein and Harris.

Their situations, however, 

were very different. Bernstein 
was 
working 
with 
friends 

in a study group as they do 

every week. She said working 
together means answers might 
be similar, but is a common 
result when collaborating with 
students.

“I 
wasn’t 
cheating,” 

Bernstein said. “I was genuinely 
working with someone else to 
help through the concepts, so to 
say that working together could 
be a form of cheating, I think 
it’s just really unfair because 
I feel like we go to a really 
collaborative 
university. 
On 

campus, there isn’t that much 
sense of competition among 
students. I work together with 
other students in my classes all 
the time so to be able to work 
on a problem together when 
it’s multiple choice and not get 

To tip off the University of 

Michigan’s Academic Innovation 
Initiative Summit, University deans 
gathered at a panel on the future of 
innovation in academics Tuesday 
afternoon, with 70 in attendance.

Last year, University President 

Mark Schlissel and former Provost 
Martha Pollack kicked off the 
Academic Innovation Initiative, 
an effort to engage all members 
of the University community in 
discussions on how to further the 
University’s projects and promote 
constant 
academic 
innovation. 

The summit, held at the end of 
the University’s bicentennial year, 
included 
panels 
and 
breakout 

activities supporting the initiative.

James Hilton, vice provost for 

academic innovation and dean of 
libraries, 
moderated 
Tuesday’s 

conversation and began by asking 
panelists how they are developing 
academic innovation within their 
respective schools.

Lynn Videka, dean of the School 

of Social Work, spoke about three 
main areas of academic innovation 
the school has been working toward: 
Launching a MicroMasters Massive 
Open Online Courses program in 
the fall, using captivated modules 
and face-to-face interactions to 
train social workers in hybrid 
continuing 
education 
programs 

and developing the Civil Rights 
Academy, a program that aims to 
provide technology and tools to 

instill middle-school- and high-
school-age youth with social action 
skills at an early age.

“It’s in helping develop informed 

and responsible citizens,” Videka 
said. “This Civil Rights Academy 
does just that — it awakens young 
adolescents to social justice issues, 
how to organize in the community, 
how to achieve goals working with 
social groups. We think that’s a 
great skill and a worthy contribution 
and something that doesn’t compete 
… 
with 
our 
in-person 
based 

programs.”

Joanna Millunchick, associate 

dean of undergraduate education 
in the College of Engineering, 
discussed how the school’s on-the-
ground 
classroom 
innovation 

techniques, such as their new Ph.D. 
program, Engineering Education 
Research, 
place 
engineering 

education researchers into the 
actual departments rather than 
creating a new, separate research 
department. The school is also 
developing new modes of teaching 
through virtual and augmented 
reality techniques.

“Our 
students 
know 
(these 

techniques) are the next big thing, 
too. … They are the ones taking the 
top (research) prizes. They already 
realize what it is that future scorers 
hold,” Millunchick said.

Jonathan Massey, dean of the 

Taubman College of Architecture 
and Urban Planning, spoke on the 
school’s emphasis on preserving a 
community of face-to-face learners 
and peer collaboration. However, 
architecture’s high contact hour 
per credit hour program raises the 
question of how to apply academic 

innovation to preserving hands-
on training and balancing time 
dedication.

“(Time dedication) skews the 

field,” Massey said. “Our project is to 
figure out how to incorporate some 
of the academic innovation and 
blend in a way that preserves the 
strengths of the studio pedagogy.” 

Laurie McCauley, dean of the 

School of Dentistry, emphasized her 
goal to use academic innovation to 
personalize education in three main 
areas: online degree completion 
programs, the University’s first 

completely 
online 
bachelor’s 

degree; Pathways, the dental school 
curriculum used throughout all 
four years of the program; and 
the 
community-based 
dental 

program, partnering with health 
professionals at 20 sites throughout 
the state for patient care.

“I am quite fortunate that our 

faculty need very little prodding 
to do this; they love doing these 
projects, they love engaging with 
students on a one-on-one basis and 
individualized manner,” McCauley 
said.

Thomas Finholt, dean of the 

School of Information, emphasized 
the importance of Massive Open 
Online Courses and the school’s 
commitment to online education. 
Several hundred thousand people 
are taught through MOOCs and 
a third of faculty are involved in 
these online education platforms, 
according to Finholt.

“(MOOCs) 
really 
reflect 

three kinds of considerations — 
expanding the brand and reaching 
out, 80 percent of students who have 
With current political climate 

and an increasing number of athletic 
protests against social inequalities, 
the interplay between sports and 
public policy are two entities 
that are becoming increasingly 
intertwined, according to former 
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
and Jim Hackett, president and 
CEO of Ford Motor Company 
and former interim director of 
University of Michigan athletics. 
The two discussed this intersection 
and more to University faculty and 
students Tuesday afternoon. 

Since September 2016, the NFL 

has been the topic of controversy 
within much of the political 
sphere, as former NFL player Colin 
Kaepernick first knelt during the 
national anthem to protest social 
and political tension nationwide. 
Other athletes have followed suit, 
leading President Donald Trump 
and other politicians to denounce 
the symbolic protest of kneeling. 
NFL teams like the Saints, Ravens, 
Jaguars and multiple individual 
players from teams throughout the 
league, have been controversially 
contributing to the cause originally

CSG passes #UMDivest resolution 
in a secret ballot after 8 hour meeting

HALEY MCLAUGHLIN/Daily

Pro-divestment audience members holds signs that read “Stop Silencing Us” at the CSG Divestment Resolution in the MLB Tuesday.

SARAH KUNKEL/Daily

Panelists at the Academic Innovation Initiative Summit in the Michigan League Tuesday. 

ACADEMICS

 159 of 305 academic integrity violations 
were due to unauthorized collaboration 

23 votes for and 17 against, resolution approved for first time in campus history

Divestment — for the first time 

in the University of Michigan, 
Ann Arbor’s history — passed 

at Central Student Government 
early Wednesday morning with 23 
voting in favor, 17 against, and 5 
abstained. 

“We feel like we finally were 

given a voice on this campus,” a 
SAFE student tearily said to the 
audience. “We are celebrating 
when Palestinian are given real 
human rights. This is the first step 

we can take. This is an amazing 
victory.”

The divestment movement calls 

for the support of the University of 
Michigan administration to divest 
from companies operating in Israel, 
on the behalf of Palestinians and 
in fear of human rights violations 
against them. The resolution this 
year was embroiled in controversy 

within 
the 
Central 
Student 

Government 
executive 
board, 

prompting CSG to create its own 
investigative committee. 

The meeting Tuesday night 

deviated from previous years in 
several ways. Unlike last year, a 
secret ballot was approved, with 
28 in favor, 7 against, 9 abstained.

Many argued this was beneficial 
for the safety of pro-Palestinian 
students 
from 
damaging 

blacklists. 

Another was the outpouring 

of support: CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior, took the floor to describe 
her own experiences as an 
Arab 
and 
Muslim 
student. 

She stated her support of the 
resolution, empathizing with the 
feelings Jewish students have 
experienced because she has 
faced marginalization herself.

She urged CSG members to 

support divestment, standing in 
front of the assembly despite the 
possibility of personal backlash.

“We have to continue talking 

about this but we also have to 
recognize if we want equitable 
footing on this, we need to give 
all people an opportunity and a 
voice,” Jawad said.

Public Health graduate student 

Dana Greene Jr., who knelt on 
the Diag for 21 hours to protest 

racism, also showed his support 
for divestment. While he clarified 
he did not see the resolution as 
anti-Israel, he also said he could 
not ignore his moral values.

“I do not ask you to pass this 

resolution as a sentiment against 
Israel … all that I ask is that you 
support all people, including 
Palestinians,” he said. “If one of 
us suffers all of us suffer. … When 
I kneeled on that Diag in pain, I 
watched thousands of students 
walk past me. I ask you today to 
not be one of those people that 
walked past.”

Tuesday morning, the Black 

Student Union tweeted their 
endorsement 
of 
divestment. 

Members of the BSU executive 
board attended the meeting, 
following many other social-
justice oriented organizations in 
supporting Students Allied for 
Freedom and Equality, the group 
that first brought the resolution to 
CSG.

This year, History professor 

Victor 
Lieberman 
was 
not 

approved to join the list of 
speakers, prompting cheers from 
pro-divest students. Lieberman 
teaches 
on 
the 
Arab-Israeli 

conflict, and spoke last year 
heavily 
against 
divestment. 

Then-LSA senior Devin Jones 
criticized 
Lieberman, 
stating 

Lieberman’s 
rhetoric 
victim-

blamed Palestinians. 

Public Policy junior Samuel 

Lawrence spoke on Lieberman’s 
behalf Tuesday night, reading 
from his notes on how BDS aims 
to bring Israel down. Former 
CSG Rep. Gaby Roth, an LSA 
senior, followed, urging current 
CSG members to vote against 
divestment as she did last year as 
she believes the movement is anti-
Semitic and aims to wipe out the 
Jewish population. 

Former 
CSG 
Rep. 
Farah 

Erzouki, a University alum, spoke 
in favor of divestment, addressing 
CSG directly and highlighting that 
the vote isn’t to sanction a country, 
but rather specific companies that 
are tied to allegations of human 
rights violations. Erzouki also 
emphasized the weeks divestment 
is discussed are consistently very 
well-attended by students, as they 
use the meetings as a platform to 
express their views.

“I’ve 
seen 
at 
this 
point 

thousands of students rally 

over leaders in support 
of divestment this issue 
and this request does not 
exist in a vacuum. There is 
long standing and diverse 
support on this issue as you 
have seen.” 

She went on to list 

several institutions whose 
student governing bodies 
pass 
similar 
divestment 

issues. 

“As a former member of 

student government and 
as someone who has been 
on our campus community 
since 2010, this is by far 
the concern that brings 
the 
highest 
number 
of 

students attending these 
meetings time and time 
again and every single 
year. It’s important for 
representatives to really 
grasp what they’re deciding 
— whether they’re deciding 
to amplify the voices of the 
students coming back time 
and time again.”

taken our MOOCs are outside 
the United States, representing 
over 200 countries,” Finholt 
said. “We also aspire to use our 
MOOCs to reach an important 
domestic audience, which are 
students in community colleges 
who are transfer candidates … 
And (use) MOOCs as a way of 
exploring alternative completion 
of a residential degree.”

Hilton 
then 
moved 
the 

conversation into a dialogue 
on MOOCs and their place 
at the University. Instead of 
a 
dichotomous 
relationship 

between 
offering 
completely 

online courses and face-to-face 
interaction 
with 
professors 

as implemented now, Videka 
said both teaching methods 
can be utilized to provide 
comprehensive educations.

The Masters of Social Work 

program only offers a full-
time option, which includes a 
mandatory 912 credit hours of 
field experience, and Videka said 
many people cannot commit to 
the full-time program. Even now, 
MSW students have demanded 
equitable pay for these field 
hours because they offset time 
students could be working to pay 
for school, rent or food for their 
families.

Videka said online courses 

could both include these students 
who could only complete a part-
time program that currently isn’t 
offered and spur new ideas in the 
full program.

“In some sense, (MOOCs) will 

open a slightly new market but 
the flipside of that is it’s requiring 
us to completely rethink the rest 
of our program,” she said.

Taking into account the field 

experience 
many 
programs 

require at the University, Finholt 
said some MOOCs in the School 
of Information lend themselves 
very well to an autograder 
that can check an assignment 
automatically and show whether 
the student got the question 
correct, but other courses require 
more thought in how to replicate 
a field position.

“How do we deal with this 

problem 
of 
assessing 
(our 

programs) online when so much 

of the pedagogical practice of 
my school is oriented toward 
experiential learning or engaged 
learning where people are doing 
field placements?” Finholt said.

Millunchick said the current 

tendency of MOOCs to be large 
classes can decrease diversity in 
ideas, especially in task-oriented 
fields. She said instead of putting 
one large class on a project, they 
could utilize small, private online 
courses, set 50 smaller classes on 
a project and see a large diversity 
of solutions to the same problem.

Many 
argued 
MOOCs 

puts 
quality 
education 
that 

is 
inaccessible 
to 
some 

communities in their hands, 
provided they had the technology 
to support it. Massey said while 
this is true, the product the 
University already offers, face-
to-face education, will become 
highly coveted.

“(MOOCs) 
democratize 

education but we will, in fact, 
reinforce the prestige value, the 
monetary value of face-to-face 
communities around campuses 
like this one because that will 
become the exception rather 
than the norm,” Massey said.

During 
a 
Q&A 
segment, 

Provost Martin Philbert asked 
the panelists what innovations 
they would take with their 
schools if they had no budgetary 
restrictions. 
While 
specific 

applications in their schools 
varied, 
many 
panelists 
saw 

common characteristics of higher 
education such as expertise 
and curriculums as worthwhile 
targets for innovation.

Finholt 
said 
academic 

institutions across the Big Ten 
conference and worldwide are 
not recognizing where their 
strengths 
are 
nor 
catering 

educational products to those 
strengths. With no monetary 
restrictions, Finholt said students 
could access professionals across 
the country digitally.

“It would be great if we could 

… stop having to teach the things 
we’re not very good at and 
recognize that there are other 
places in the world that are really 
good at teaching those things and 
let our students take those courses 
from those institutions and from 
those instructors,” Finholt said.

Millunchick said the way 

schools in the University such 
as the College of Engineering 

and the Taubman College have 
to 
structure 
their 
students’ 

curriculums so they can graduate 
on time includes taking classes 
certain semesters to align with 
course offerings. Millunchick said 
the University could be utilizing 
technology to help students 
explore their other interests, 
gather necessary knowledge for 
their concentrations and break 
out of locked-in curriculums.

“If 
we 
could 
somehow 

use technology to break that 
curricular demand so that … 
rather than having to follow these 
curriculum locks, students could 
take the curriculum a different 
kind of way,” Millunchick said. 

Rachel Niemer, director of 

the Gameful Learning Lab in the 
Office of Academic Innovation, 
said the summit was designed 
to gear the campus community 
toward thinking forward to what 
the University could achieve.

“I 
think, 
honestly, 
we’re 

heading 
for 
some 
really 

interesting, 
thoughtful 

conversation 
amongst 
the 

community about what our values 
are and how we’re going to share 
and co-create knowledge with 
the broader community,” Niemer 
said.

Philbert, during his segment, 

noted all of the panelists had come 
from professional backgrounds 
and professional schools and, 
therefore, have a bias toward 
preparing students specifically for 
the workforce.

Matt MacQueen, a lecturer at 

the Center for Entrepreneurship, 
attended the summit and found 
it encouraging to hear people 
critique longstanding institutions 
of higher education. He said while 
LSA was not represented at the 
final panel, the ideas mentioned 
are not limited exclusively to 
professional paths and these tools 
could be available to more liberal 
arts students and faculty.

“I think the opportunities 

in less professionally driven 
programs 
are 
just 
around 

different, more exciting ways 
to learn, less that it has to have a 
concrete, job outcome at the other 
end of it,” MacQueen said. “I 
would be bullish on people in LSA 
thinking about these tools as just 
more engaging ways to get more 
learners and get them thinking in 
different ways than it is, ‘Here’s 
your path to a profession exactly.’ ”

Harris, on the other hand, was 

asked by a friend if she could send 
her the homework answers. While 
Harris specified that her friend 
should rephrase the answers, her 
friend submitted them as is and 
both were flagged for academic 
dishonesty. 
Harris 
said 
while 

sharing her answer wasn’t a 
completely innocent action, she 
should not be punished to the 
extent that her friend who copied 
the answer was because Harris did 
the homework and her friend did 
not.

“I think that I did make an error 

in the fact that I sent my answer to 
someone,” Harris said. “However, 
I don’t think I should be getting 
the same punishment as someone 
who copied my answer because 
I explicitly stated that she did 
not have permission to copy my 
answer word for word. I do think 
that I kind of cheated, but I don’t 
think to the level of someone who 
just copies something.”

According to Esrold Nurse, LSA 

assistant dean for undergraduate 
education, common misconceptions 
like the ones in Stats 250 are 
reflected in data gathered by the 
Office of the Assistant Dean and 
the LSA Student Academic Affairs 
Office. Data provided by Nurse 
shows 159 of the 305 academic 
integrity violations reported to 
SAA in the 2016-17 school year 
were categorized as unauthorized 
collaboration. In addition, 170 of 
these violations were dealt with 
within the class structure instead 
of through SAA.

Brenda 
Gunderson, 
statistics 

senior lecturer, confirmed this 
large number of unauthorized 
collaboration reports was from 
Stats 250. Now, she said, the 
class utilizes an internal system 
consisting of an email conversation 
between the Stats 250 student and 
the lecturer, and an automatic zero 
when the first instance of academic 
dishonesty appears. She said this 
protocol is meant to teach students 
about the classroom’s expectations 
and then move on with the material.

“We want the students to grow 

from the experience,” Gunderson 
said. “In fact, our response to 
them when they come back and 
say, ‘We’re sorry’; we want it to 
be a teachable moment and so we 
internally say, ‘OK, well then what 
we’ll do is that homework will get a 
score of zero but we drop the lowest 
homework score in the class too, so 
in the end that can be no effect on 
their grade and I don’t keep track 
and have a list of students that have 
had this happen. … We want them 
to know we aren’t going to pass any 
judgement on them for the mistake. 
It’s done. It’s gone.”

For 
Bernstein’s 
situation, 

Gunderson said she encourages 
collaboration but in terms of 
actually writing short answers, 
wording would be different if 
written 
independently 
after 

understanding the concept.

“When you are sort of given an 

open-ended prompt of ‘Take from 
this output and write up a two or 
three or four sentence summary’ 
… those things would be maybe 
focusing on similar numbers but 
said in different ways and if a 
student is struggling, it’s easy to 
try to explain but then just let them 
look at your answer,” Gunderson 
said. “If you went through the idea 
of what a confidence interval means 
and you each got the good idea and 
went off in your own corners and 

wrote it up, it wouldn’t be identical. 
You would have your own little 
flair.”

The LSA Academic Integrity 

Statement is reportedly included 
in all LSA class syllabi, according 
to Nurse. This statement defines 
cheating as “creating an unfair 
academic advantage” for yourself 
or others in your class. This could 
involve cheating to offset a grading 
curve that negatively affects the 
rest of the class and many other 
scenarios like Bernstein and Harris 
experienced.

Official cases not dealt with 

internally, reach the desk of Nurse. 
From there, the student and Nurse 
enter a conversation about the 
situation. If an agreement cannot be 
reached, the case is sent to the LSA 
Academic 
Judiciary 
Committee 

for review and to determine if a 
student has violated the statement 
or not. In 2016-17, 104 of all 
academic integrity cases found 
the students responsible for the 
violation. Twenty-one were found 
not responsible.

Nurse 
said 
discrepancies 

between 
academic 
integrity 

protocols 
of 
different 
colleges 

such as LSA and the College of 
Engineering can be confusing, 
but as for LSA, uniformity among 
classes is key.

“The College of Engineering, for 

example, has an honor code,” Nurse 
said. “Students sign the pledge 
each time they take an exam. (LSA 
doesn’t) have an honor code but that 
doesn’t mean we’re less committed 
to integrity. How we manage it is 
a little different because we have 
more students and more cases to 
attend to, so we have a process 
which, we think, works well for us. 
It respects the educational aspect of 
it. We allow faculty to resolve cases 
for themselves rather than sending 
(students) to us for fear that we’re 
going to do something really bad 
which we don’t.”

The 
statement 
was 
written 

in conjunction with the LSA 
Student Honor Council, a group of 
undergraduate students who work 
with students and staff to promote 
academic 
integrity 
and 
create 

uniform procedures for reporting 
academic dishonesty cases. They 
also inform students of what 
their options are when accused of 
committing academic misconduct. 

However, LSA seniors Khyati 

Somayaji and Laura Donohue, the 
SHC president and vice president, 
respectively, make it clear they 
do not act as lawyers or defense 
for students. They attend LSA 
Academic 
Judiciary 
Committee 

sessions, but they do not take a side 
or vote in the verdict.

Donohue 
said 
the 
faculty 

presentations were implemented last 
year and allow the SHC to clarify 
some misconceptions about the 
reporting process and create a fair 
situation for the faculty and students.

“There’s 
a 
lot 
of 

misunderstanding about what the 
academic 
misconduct 
reporting 

process is and what exactly the 
hearing process means for students, 
so it’s really important that we get 
to go in and clarify that,” Donohue 
said. “I think it’s also valuable for 
faculty to see that there are students 
on campus who have an interest in 
integrity.”

Somayaji said academic integrity 

is important to promote because it 
affects the lives of students once 
they graduate through them having 
good morals and representing their 
work as their own.

“These values really play out 

into not only professional lives but 
social lives and being a responsible 
community 
member,” 
Somayaji 

said. “We do a lot of work that really 
puts our values and ideals into 
perspective farther down the road 

than just academics.”

Nurse 
echoed 
Somayaji’s 

sentiments and said if people 
practice good academic integrity 
in school now, they will feel a much 
larger sense of accomplishment 
once they graduate than if they had 
cheated and got away with it.

“There was a student who 

graduated and became a doctor 
who wrote to me 30 years later as 
his kids were in high school and 
admitted to me that he had cheated 
not once but three times while he 
was here as a student and wasn’t 
caught,” Nurse said. “He got away 
with it because no one knew but 
here it is, 30 years later, that his 
conscience is beginning to (wear 
thin). … When you’ve earned your 
degree, you earn your degree and 
that’s something you should be 
proud of. You shouldn’t have any 
regrets later on.”

This 
year, 
Stats 
250 
has 

implemented the M-Write program 
into the course to encourage 
students to think critically and 
be able to write about statistical 
concepts. 
Previously 
an 
LSA 

honors credit option, the writing 
assignments are now officially 
part of the curriculum. With these 
new 
longer 
essay 
assignments 

comes the worry of students 
passing and selling their essays 
through what Nurse calls “essay 
mills.” With one search on a 
University class Facebook page, 
sites like eHomework can be found. 
EHomework offers “a high quality 
paper” and encourages students to 
“NOT BE AFRAID” because the 
site has “NEVER had a student get 
in trouble for ordering an essay 
from (them).”

Gunderson said she’s not looking 

for students sharing essays or 
utilizing essay mills because the pros 
of giving students experience with 
writing in statistics outweigh the 
cons of a longer written assignment.

“The 
ability 
to 
write 
and 

communicate is so much more 
important these days, and even 
more so in STEM disciplines,” 
Gunderson said. “We’re bring this 
into the course because there’s a 
very useful learning experience 
through that process and … a 
student is going to get so much 
more out of it if they indeed to that 
writing experience than if they just 
take something off the internet and 
submit it. It’s not worth those three 
points.”

Nurse said these essay mills are 

just another difficulty in the current 
age of technology that professors 
have to watch out for.

“The internet has expanded the 

availability of information related 
to almost anything conceivable 
that you’re trying to find so there 
are times students take shortcuts,” 
Nurse said. “Professors have had to 
work very hard to design homework 
and exams to reduce the incidents 
of plagiarism, and I think they’ve 
done a good job. Having students do 
drafts, for example, are key.”

With so many elements of 

cheating to monitor, Bernstein 
said she had never heard of essay 
mills. However, she said she hopes 
most University students don’t 
use mills or other students’ work, 
but the University should better 
understand the difference between 
accidentally having similar answers 
and directly stealing work.

“There are some ways of cheating 

that you just know are wrong. You 
just know you don’t buy a paper off 
someone else,” Bernstein said. “You 
know you don’t submit another 
student’s work, but there are 
definitely these gray areas when it 
comes to working with students or 
citing something wrong where you 
didn’t purposefully, intentionally 
try to disrespect the Code of 
Academic Integrity.”

Angell Hall Auditorium B. 

PITCH PE RFECT

evoked by Kaepernick.

Hackett 
and 
Tagliabue 

spoke about kneeling boding 
the question of whether or not 
NFL players should be given the 
platform to voice their opinion 
on political matters while on the 
field.

Tagliabue, who served as 

commissioner of the NFL from 
1989 to 2006, expanded the 
league from 28 to 32 teams and 
was heavily active in social 
justice movements. Tagliabue 
moved 
Superbowl 
XXVII 

from Arizona after the state 
refused to establish a state 
holiday in honor of Martin 
Luther King Jr. and has also 
been honored for his work 
with LBGTQ rights group 
Parents, Friends and Families 
of Lesbians and Gays. 

“It’s 
complicated,” 

Tagliabue 
said 
on 
the 

connection between sports 
and public policy. “Sports 
have had an enormous impact 
on diversity and inclusion and 
on our relationships with each 
other — race, color, creed, 
etc. Athletes and sports can 
have an enormous positive 
effect on communities; we 
are all woven together in the 
best of circumstances that is 
the melting that that is our 
society.”

Hackett served as interim 

director of Michigan athletics 
from Oct. 31, 2014, to March 
11, 2016, and served on the 
Ford School Committee from 
2006 to 2017, making his 
involvement in sports and 
policy 
extensive. 
Hackett 

recalled his time on and off 
the field.

“There is no line between 

racism and patriotism, they 
are just your teammates,” 
Hackett said. “The highest 
percent of participation on a 
team is when you don’t think 
of yourself, you think of the 
person next to you. My dream 

was that the young people on 
campus would understand the 
underpinnings of diversity 
and inclusion meant when 
it was not mediated and was 
highly controversial.”

Tagliabue emphasized the 

fine line between protest and 
action. He questioned what 
societal change this protest 
could enact and how players 
can move forward with their 
message.

“I think you’ve got to fight,” 

Tagliabue said. “But you have 
to do it in the right way. If 
your goal is to galvanize the 
public in support of a point of 
view that you’re advocating, 
you need to pay attention 
to not only those who are 
already with you, but those 
who are not yet convinced. 
That means you have to 
strike a balance, you have 
to understand what it takes 
to grow your constituency. 
You need to recognize the 
limits of a sports institution. 
However, leadership is at all 
levels at the institution.”

Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student Jai Singletary also 
emphasized the link between 
social 
justice 
movements 

and athletics, and believes 
it beneficial to continue this 
conversation.

“By tapping into the social 

aspect of what’s going on in 
the country and how it relates 
to the athletes not just within 
the NFL but within the sports 
world, protesting and voicing 
their opinions gives a little 
bit of insight about where 
protests and social change 
will come within the sports 
arena,” Singletary said. 

Traci 
Carson, 
a 
Ph.D. 

candidate 
in 
the 
School 

of Public Health, said she 
attended the event to expand 
her knowledge of the debate 
surrounding kneeling.

“This is a topic that I have 

been going back and forth on, 
and I think each individual 
regards the topic of kneeling 
and the First Amendment 
right differently, and I think it 

is really important to ask why 
they are doing it, and to get 
that individual’s response and 
not generalize everybody into 
one group; it is their choice to 
or to not kneel,” Carson said.

LSA senior Kyle Lefkowitz, 

however, 
questioned 
what 

comes next after kneeling for 
the anthem. 

“This is such an important 

platform for the players — 
allowing them to be able to 
fight for what they believe. 
Now we just have to continue 
with actions and not just 
words,” Lefkowitz said.

Tagliabue later urged the 

students to try to understand 
why 
people 
protest. 
He 

believes it is imperative to 
acknowledge 
why 
people 

are fighting and, even if the 
president demands a halt in 
the discussion of policy, people 
continue the conversation.

“You won’t gain respect 

if you think that ‘the only 
solution is mine,’ ” Tagliabue 
said. “You have to understand 
who 
these 
people 
are. 

Everyone should understand 
that we do have a First 
Amendment right in America, 
and 
that 
the 
government 

should stay the hell out of 
regulating speech. You should 
be able to say what you think. 
He cannot shut us down. That 
is not America.”

Tagliabue left University 

students with advice on how 
this controversy can teach 
values and unite the next 
generation.

“Men 
and 
women 
are 

better prepared in society to 
be leaders than ever before. 
We need to make sure they 
have the research and the 
institutions to give them the 
opportunity to do what they’re 
doing 
in 
an 
environment 

where celebrity is not always 
an asset some people learned 
in last presidential election. 
Celebrity is not the key to 
the kingdom. Hard work, 
good ideas and institutional 
support is the key to the 
kingdom.”

AWARENESS
From Page 1A


L

ast week, I got my ear 
pierced. I had wanted 
to do it for several days 

before, to change up my look — to 
try something new. 
There was, in other 
words, 
no 
larger, 

existential reasoning 
behind this desire, 
no deeper truth I 
thought a piercing 
would illuminate or 
help me enact.

But I was wrong. 

In the ensuing days, 
I’ve begun to regard 
my piercing as a sort 
of imprint on my own body. I’d 
never physically changed myself 
in such a permanent way before. 
After haircuts, sometimes I’d feel 
like a new person, walking down 
the street with a new swagger 
— or, if things went badly, with a 
new necessity to hide my face. But 
regardless, hair would always grow 
back and take its same afro-like 
shape that is a consequence, I am 
told, of my Jewish heritage.

I see myself in the mirror now 

and I see a body on which I have 
made my own imprint. I was 
given my body and the life that 
accompanies it by some existential 
level of chance, seed and egg 
meeting and floating off together. 
But now, my body has become 
my own. And I love this feeling, 
that there are ways to increase 
the amount of control I have over 
my life. That I can become more 
myself, more in touch with my 
own predilections and identities, 
and that as I do this, I get to better 
know myself through spontaneous, 
everyday actions. It did not require 
some profound shift in my everyday 
habits to feel this way.

I feel ready to find more ways 

to manufacture this feeling. To 
own my own life, in other words. 
To seek out instances in which 
my life can become more my own, 
not just the predetermined default 
setting that was given to me by 
incomprehensible 
coincidences 

that I did nothing to bring about.

And in the days since I got my 

piercing, this feeling has manifested 
itself in other ways. I have begun 
to write a play, which I hope can 
be performed in Ann Arbor at the 

end of next term, when I will also 
be graduating. In the play, I see 
an opportunity for a text that I 
can forever look back on and say, I 

wrote that there, during 
that time. A text that 
represents my time at the 
University of Michigan.

I am studying abroad 

this 
semester, 
but 

before I came here, I 
had planned to write a 
traditional thesis — a 
research essay guided 
by a set of research 
questions. But it has 
been extremely difficult 

to get in touch with advisers back 
in Ann Arbor and to establish the 
necessary consistent connection 
to help overcome this distance 
between me and familiar libraries, 
professors and resources. Too 
much work, I thought. Not worth 
it, since it will distract from my 
ability to be here. A feeling — 
probably overstated — that these 
advisers are too busy, or, at worst, 
that they do not actually care 
enough about my academic work 
to engage with me, unless I am in 
their office in person.

But the play I have now decided 

to write demonstrates my taking 
this wish to work into my own 
hands. To occupy the space, left 
vacant by both the silence from my 
advisers and the physical distance 
between me and Ann Arbor, in 
creative ways that speak to my 
own individuality.

I think this notion lies at the 

center of what we call “growing 
up.” That I, as a child, was cradled 
and nourished and supported 
by my upbringing — my family 
and friends whom I love dearly. 
That these relationships made 
me entirely dependent on these 
people, on these systems of 
familiarity and comfort.

And these people and systems 

are not constant. For example, Louis 
C.K., a person whom I have described 
to dozens of friends throughout my 
childhood as the figure whose life I 
would like to most closely emulate, 
has just been exposed as a sexual 
predator, creep and liar. 

C.K.’s standup routines and 

his Emmy-winning TV show 
portray a certain honest humanity 

that I always found powerfully 
endearing 
and 
refreshing: 
a 

messy, smelly, morally ambiguous 
portrayal of human life that I often 
felt reflected my own everyday 
experience grappling with my own 
insecurities and incapabilities.

But C.K.’s honesty, as it turns 

out, was merely a mask for his 
systematic 
manipulation 
and 

deceit of the women he assaulted. 
As he told stories of his own 
masturbatory fantasies onstage, 
to an audience of millions, we can 
only now begin to understand 
the ways in which these fantasies 
manifested 
themselves. 
It 
is 

sickening 
to 
imagine 
C.K.’s 

personal fetish being fulfilled 
by his unknowing, relentlessly 
laughing audience.

The social death of this personal 

hero provides an opportunity for me 
to emerge more singularly myself. It 
allows me to define my own desires 
and values, and not rely upon 
somebody else, who, as it has turned 
out, I did not know at all. 

And of course, I’m still more 

dependent on my upbringing than 
the vast majority of people have the 
privilege to be. My family allows 
me to explore all my interests. They 
fund my education, for which I 
am endlessly grateful. My friends, 
many of whom I have known my 
entire life, know me better than I 
know myself. And they can provide 
me with indispensable reminders 
of encouragement and love.

But this increasing sentiment 

of self-ownership shifts how I 
understand my background. I want 
to approach it as a springboard 
to leap into the world, to treat the 
people and the world that raised 
me as safety nets to fall back on if 
and when the world treats me, as 
my academic advisers did, with 
silence; to trust in the power of 
this love; to know that it exists, 
regardless of physical distance; 
and to use this trust as a tool 
for empowerment, to ignite my 
transformation into an individual 
who continues to make imprints — 
both physical and intellectual — on 
my own life.

“T

hey treat me like 
Cinderella 
around 

here,” 
I 
once 

exaggerated when I was little. I was 
never too interested 
in the general idea of 
princesses, but they’re 
a staple in the media 
diet of young girls. 
They line the toy 
aisles and are one 
of the main focuses 
of children’s movies 
and TV shows, so 
they’re easy for kids to 
connect with.

Despite 
their 

prevalence, children’s movies that 
feature princesses fail to capture and 
showcase a range of experiences and 
backgrounds. While the princess 
narrative usually brings to mind a 
helpless maiden waiting for a man 
to save her, like Snow White or 
Sleeping Beauty, there is a chance 
for the narrative to instead teach 
young girls to learn important values 
like determination, ambition and 
bravery and feature characters from 
diverse backgrounds.

Among the hordes of remakes 

of Cinderella, only a select few 
put women of color in the iconic 
role. I recently watched one of 
these, Rodgers & Hammerstein’s 
“Cinderella” from 1997, for the 
first time in over a decade. When 
I was little, I remember going to 
day camp and always asking to 
watch that movie when we had to 
stay inside. I’m sure this irritated 
everyone, but this was my movie 
when I was in elementary school 
and rewatching it showed me why 
I was so drawn to it. First of all, 
there’s so much color. It makes it 
easy to understand why I wanted 
to watch it all the time — the 
visuals are stunning. The ornate 
fabrics that the characters wear 
are beautiful and the color scheme 
for the ball scene is mesmerizing. 
I wanted to wear all the fancy, 
funky dresses — especially the 

one Cinderella, played by actress 
and singer Brandy, wore at the 
ball. The visuals pair brilliantly 
with the music. The songs and 

dance 
numbers 
are 

the definition of extra: 
they’re hilarious, over 
the top and they stay in 
your head for at least a 
week. When you have 
Whitney 
Houston 

singing in a movie, you 
know the songs will 
become 
iconic. 
The 

song “Impossible” has 
been stuck in my head 
since I heard it in the 

early 2000s.

What was most important for me 

in elementary school was how diverse 
the cast was. It featured Whoopi 
Goldberg, Whitney Houston, Paolo 
Montalbán and Brandy. It’s funny 
how this movie had no problem 
casting actors of colors while most 
movies, including the more recent 
2015 adaptation of “Cinderella,” 
struggle to do this. Seeing a princess 
that looked like me, Black with box 
braids, and seeing a fairy godmother 
with curly hair was rare and special. 
Aside from the amazing score, scenes, 
colors and hilarity of the movie, the 
image of Brandy as Cinderella has 
stuck with me since I was little. I, 
like every child, looked to find myself 
among the images on the screen and 
in books. “Cinderella” gave me a 
character to identify with, unlike most 
media produced in the early 2000s.

The 
1997 
adaptation 
of 

“Cinderella” 
went 
against 
the 

standard of most Disney movies 
and princess movies of the time — 
but it was only one of a few movies 
that starred a woman of color. After 
seeing Disney’s animated renditions 
of “Cinderella,” “Snow White,” 
“Sleeping Beauty” and “The Little 
Mermaid” too many times on ABC 
Family, I felt that Disney was long 
overdue to release a movie about a 
Black princess.

Disney finally delivered in 2009 

with the release of “The Princess 
and the Frog.” I was too old to aspire 
to be a princess; they didn’t hold as 
 

important a part in my life as they 
did when I was little. But Tiana 
spoke to whom I hoped to become. 
She was smart, worked hard and 
was hopeful. In most narratives that 
involve women, especially princess 
narratives, the woman waits for a 
man to save her. But Tiana used her 
intelligence to save herself and that 
knuckleheaded prince who turned 
her into a frog.

You can say that princesses and 

princess movies are silly and that they 
are not worth paying attention to, but 
they are part of a larger discussion 
about what values we instill in 
children, especially young girls 
who make up the target audience. 
Movies like the 1997 adaptation of 
“Cinderella,” “The Princess and the 
Frog” and “Mulan” incorporate the 
stories of different cultures and areas 
into media consumed by elementary 
school children.

This gives them the opportunity 

to see themselves reflected in 
characters and also learn about 
other cultures. Evaluating which 
lessons these movies teach children 
is just as important as ensuring 
that the stories told are diverse and 
include characters from different 
racial or ethnic backgrounds. Are 
these movies emphasizing the old-
school princess tropes of waiting for 
“true love” or “Prince Charming” 
to solve everything or do they focus 
on the importance of standing up 
for yourself and individuality like 
in “The Princess and the Frog” and 
“Brave”? I want the word “princess” 
redefined; instead of the negative 
connotation it has of a “fair maiden” 
waiting for everything to be done 
for her, it should come to mean an 
independent, strong, courageous 
person of any skin tone.

Election wins should embolden Democrats 

NOAH HARRISON | COLUMN

S

ave for a special Senate 
race in Alabama, the 2017 
election cycle has come 

and gone. With only a handful of 
governorships and state legislature 
seats up for election, the 2017 cycle 
will ultimately have a minimal 
immediate impact on the balance 
of power. Yet, it nonetheless 
provides a significant gauge of 
current 
political 
sentiments 

nearly a year into Donald Trump’s 
presidency. 
Furthermore, 

it 
validates 
the 
Democrats’ 

opposition to President Trump 
and congressional Republicans as 
a legitimate strategy. 

The Democratic Party assuaged 

many of the lingering concerns 
from their string of special 
election defeats earlier this year 
with a dominant performance. In 
the two most high-profile races 
of the night, the party reclaimed 
and retained the New Jersey and 
Virginia governorships. Though 
victory in New Jersey was widely 
expected, in Virginia, Democrat 
Ralph Northam won by nine 
points despite polls projecting a 
closer race.

Though less covered by the 

media, Democrats made massive 
gains 
in 
state 
legislatures, 

retaking the Washington state 
Senate 
and 
possibly 
gaining 

control of the Virginia House 
of Delegates, depending on the 
final vote tallies in several still-
uncalled districts. This success 
in state elections is of particular 
interest 
to 
the 
Democratic 

National Committee, given the 
Democratic Party’s loss of over 
1,000 
state 
legislative 
seats 

nationwide since 2008.

Collectively, 
these 
victories 

will potentially yield dividends 
in 2020, when congressional 
districts are redrawn. Perhaps a 
more meaningful, if less tangible, 
result is the validation of the 
Democrats’ vigorous and unified 
opposition 
to 
the 
legislative 

agenda of President Trump and 
congressional Republicans.

This 
strategy 
most 
visibly 

manifested itself in the Democrats’ 
loud and bitter opposition to the 
Republican Party’s many efforts 
over the past year to “repeal and 
replace” Obamacare. None of the 
plans put forward by the GOP 
garnered any Democratic support, 
but rather prompted Democrats 
to launch a massive publicity 
campaign aimed at mobilizing 
the populace against the bill and 

securing the opposition of moderate 
Republicans like Susan Collins, 
John McCain and Lisa Murkowski.

Though it was the opposition 

of these moderate Republicans 
that ultimately doomed every 
iteration of the GOP’s health care 
bill to be put before the Senate, the 
coordinated and unified opposition 
of 
congressional 
Democrats 

certainly contributed. In fact, Sen. 
McCain, R-Ariz., whose eleventh-
hour opposition killed one of the 
GOP’s most promising attempts, 
the “skinny repeal,” cited the 
universal opposition of Democrats 
as a reason for his position. He 
asserted that health care legislation 
should not be passed on “a party-
line basis.” 

Furthermore, 
the 
extended 

battle over health care drew voters’ 
attention to the issue and sharply 
increased public opposition to GOP 
repeal-and-replace plans. Though 
GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare 
limped on into September, at this 
point, Obamacare portends to 
remain the law of the land for the 
foreseeable future.

Trump’s 
historically 
low 

approval ratings, coupled with the 
GOP’s equally abysmal favorability 
marks, had already lent credence to 
the tactics employed by Democrats 
during the health care debate. 
However, the past week’s elections 
further justified this strategy of 
defiant opposition and should give 
Democrats confidence in upcoming 
political battles, including the 
GOP’s proposed tax plan.

That tax plan, in which the 

Congressional 
Budget 
Office 

projects will add $1.7 trillion to the 
national debt and primarily benefit 
the wealthiest Americans, is ripe 
for criticism. Since the House 
and Senate have already passed 
budgets for 2018, Republicans 
do not seem poised to enact 
conservative tax reform.

Though tax reform would 

greatly please top Republican 
donors, it likely will be less well-
received by the electorate as a 
whole, especially given that the 
bill could actually raise taxes on 
many middle-class Americans. 
Its potential passage portends 
to develop into another political 
liability 
that 
Democrats 
can 

exploit in 2018.

Though 
the 
notion 
that 

Democrats would be united 
and resolute in their opposition 
to Trump may seem obvious, 
Democrats 
often 
splintered 

during 
contentious 
debates 

over Trump’s nominees — even 
in the earlier months of the 
Trump administration, when 
Trump’s mandate was arguably 
at its peak. Understandably, 
red-state Democrats considered 
vulnerable in 2018 — such as 
Sens. Joe Manchin in West 
Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp in 
North Dakota and Joe Donnelly 
of Indiana — felt a need to 
protect themselves. They broke 
themselves party ranks to vote 
in favor of some of Trump’s more 
controversial Cabinet nominees 
like Jeff Sessions, Scott Pruitt 
and Ben Carson. These three 
senators were also the only 
Democrats to vote to confirm 
Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to 
Supreme Court.

Since 
these 
confirmation 

battles, Sens. Nancy Pelosi and 
Chuck Schumer have successfully 
kept the party united. This task 
will presumably only get easier in 
the wake of last week’s elections, 
which should dispel notions about 
the Democratic Party’s supposed 
inability win elections.

The Democratic Party emerges 

from the 2017 elections with 
only marginally more political 
power, but a clear blueprint for 
the 2018 midterms and beyond. 
The 
Democrats 
are 
by 
no 

means guaranteed to perform 
well in 2018 — continued party 
infighting or unforeseen political 
developments could easily derail 
Democratic 
momentum. 
But 

the party can move forward 
emboldened with the knowledge 
that appeasing President Trump 
is unnecessary and perhaps even 
counterproductive to achieving 
electoral success.

These races were not direct 

referendums 
on 
the 
Trump 

administration 
or 
the 
GOP-

controlled 
Congress, 
yet 
the 

Democratic sweep still reflects 
the President’s mandate to govern 
is weakening. Those dissatisfied 
with the current balance of power 
appear motivated, representing 
an ominous sign for Republicans. 
The Democratic Party should 
enter 2018 confident that their 
unwavering 
opposition 
to 

President Trump and his agenda 
will yield both legislative and 
electoral victories.

“Grey’s Anatomy” is still alive and well unlike most of its original cast
‘Grey’s Anatomy’ in critical 
condition after 14 seasons

As it hits the 300 mark, it’s time for ‘Grey’s’ to pass on quietly

After watching approximately 

one episode of “Grey’s Anatomy,” 
most feel as though they could 
perfectly 
execute 
a 
coronary 

artery bypass surgery (yes, I had 
to look that up). The show has been 
around for 14 seasons, and last 
week marked its 300th episode. 
Through all of the medical jargon, 
sexual scandals, dramatic deaths, 
complicated familial relationships 
and job competition, Meredith 
Grey 
(Ellen 
Pompeo, 
“Doc 

McStuffins”) is still, as they say, 
saving lives.

The episode made sentimental 

remarks on past characters, the 
deceased Dr. George O’Malley 
(T.R. Knight, “Genius”) and the 
two that left Seattle Grace Hospital, 
Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh, 
“Catfight”) and Dr. Izzie Stevens 
(Katherine Heigl, “Doubt”). Both 
characters were the main focus of 
the show until they were written 
off. “Grey’s Anatomy” revolved 
around these four, and Meredith 
is currently the only one left. Well, 
that depends if you count Dr. Alex 
Karev (Justin Chambers, “Broken 
City”) or not. He never seemed as 
close with the core four.

The main catastrophe plaguing 

the hospital in this episode is a 
roller coaster accident, in which 
two individuals remind the entire 
staff of George, Cristina and 
Izzie. Mini George and Christina 
are injured in the roller coaster 
crash, and Izzie’s look alike is 
their pregnant friend. All three of 
them surprisingly require serious 
medical attention.

Although the nostalgia of past 

characters makes both Meredith 
and the viewer hold onto emotional 
feelings, the plotline was forced. It 
doesn’t feel natural; if anything it’s 
coaxed. It felt like a last-ditched 
attempt to make viewers reflect 
on past seasons, and in doing that 
it reminded me of how “Grey’s 
Anatomy” used to be entertaining. 

This flashback is a reflection of 
how the old Greys worked, and the 
current one doesn’t. Now it’s just 
over-the-top and exhausted.

The medical drama has passed 

its expiration date. There are too 
many subplots, unrealistic health 
concerns and overplay of sexual 
promiscuity. The theatrics are 
laughable and very predictable. 
A patient cannot simply have one 
medical issue, instead he or she has 
12 and there is always a heightened 
moment of fear. The on-edge and 
tense medical procedures are 
only interesting when they are 
warranted.

It’s agitating watching all of 

these diagnoses come out of the 
woodwork when it was already 
exciting enough. The Izzie look 

alike is pregnant and passes out. 
So naturally, the doctors test and 
find her placenta has a tumor on 
it. They immediately go to surgery, 
and then they have to perform an 
emergency c-section when the 
baby is premature. The plot would 
have worked if they had her simply 
pass out. Not to mention her friends 
are on the verge of death after their 
serious accident. “Grey’s Anatomy” 
piles on the drama to the point 
where it only serves to convolute 
and overload.

The amount of sexual relations 

makes the show hard to follow. At 
every turn, someone is sleeping 
with someone else, not to mention 
during the workday. All the sex can 
make the show more interesting, 
but once again, it just feels overdone. 
Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina 
Scorsone, “The November Man”) 
walks in on her old flame, Dr. 

Owen 
Hunt 
(Kevin 
McKidd, 

“Tulip Fever”) and Dr. Carina 
DeLuca 
(Stefania 
Spampinato, 

“Two Wolves”) making out, naked. 
Dr. Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo 
Gianniotti, “Race”) gets it on with 
his ex-girlfriend, Dr. Sam Bello 
(Jeanine 
Mason, 
“Criminal 

Minds”), in the supply closet when 
their bosses, Dr. Miranda Bailey 
(Chandra Wilson, “Frankie & 
Alice”) and Dr. Richard Webber 
(James Pickens Jr., “For the Love 
of Ruth”) can hear them. Then see 
them come out. Awkward.

The 
predictability 
of 
both 

radical medical diagnoses and 
character decisions makes “Grey’s 
Anatomy” 
typical 
and 
spent. 

Meredith is up for a prestigious 
medical award, the Harper Avery 
Award. Instead of attending the 
ceremony, she stays behind to help 
with the roller coaster accident. 
Although the intention of this plot 
line was to show dedication, it 
largely fails. Of course, she didn’t 
go to the awards even though there 
were plenty of other qualified and 
capable surgeons to take care of the 
injuries. Not only does she miss the 
ceremony, but, spoiler, she wins. No 
surprise there.

The series began with Meredith 

and her friends as mere interns, 
and now they are full blown 
surgeons. The show used to follow 
their tribulations trying to prove 
themselves, sleeping at the hospital 
and working endless shifts. They 
used to camp out at a very specific 
location—a hallway removed from 
the intense environment of the 
hospital. After Meredith wins her 
award, she celebrates with one 
of the only interns from the first 
season to still be around, Dr. Alex 
Karev, on the very gurnees they 
started off on. They also kick the 
current interns out of their spot 
which is pretty cute. In addition 
to Karev, Cristina calls from 
Switzerland. 
The 
memorabilia 

should serve as a sign that “Grey’s 
Anatomy” was a good show while 
it lasted, but it’s time to wrap it up 
and move on. 

20TH CENTURY FOX

Anyone else remember Masterpiece Mystery Sunday nights at 9 p.m. on PBS??
‘Orient Express’ manages 
to entertain despite flaws

Branaugh succeeds in his retelling of the aged Poirot mystery

“Murder 
on 
the 
Orient 

Express,” both directed by 
and starring Kenneth Branagh 
(“Dunkirk”) is simultaneously 
a sleek re-mastering of a classic 
story as well as a throwback to 
a bygone era. Branagh stars as 
Hercule Poirot, one of Agatha 
Christie’s 
most 
memorable 

characters, along side an all-
star cast that includes Penélope 
Cruz (“Loving Pablo”), Willem 
Dafoe (“The Florida Project”), 
Judi 
Dench 
(“Victoria 
and 

Abdul”), Johnny Depp (“Pirates 
of the Caribbean: Dead Men 
Tell No Tales”), Josh Gad 
(“Beauty 
and 
the 
Beast”), 

Derek 
Jacobi 
(“Cinderella”), 

Leslie Odom Jr. (“Hamilton”), 
Michelle Pfeiffer (“mother!”) 
and Daisy Ridley (“Star Wars: 
The Force Awakens”). With 
witty 
dialogue, 
interesting 

characters and a mystery that 
is just as engrossing today 
as it was when Christie first 
wrote it, “Murder on the Orient 
Express” is a grand old time.

Opening in Jerusalem in 

1934, the film introduces Poirot 
with a prologue sequence that 
does an adequate job of setting 
the stage for the puzzle solving 
to come, without resorting to 
heavy-handed 
exposition 
to 

explain who Poirot is and why 
he does what he does. From 
there we are quickly introduced 
to a wide variety of characters, 
some of whom will play major 
roles in the drama to come, 
some of whom will play minor 

roles, one of whom will shortly 
be killed off, prompting the 
mystery, and all of whom are 
played by A-list talent. While 
some audience members might 
find this segment of the film to 
move at a ridiculous pace, with 
little time given for the audience 
to acclimate themselves to each 
new face before being whisked 
to the next scene, the story 
moves with such a sense of joy 
and excitement that this table 
setting doesn’t come across as 
such so much as it comes across 
as a fascinating roll-call of the 
passengers we are about to 

watch.

Once 
the 
titular 
murder 

occurs 
and 
the 
interviews 

with the suspects begin, the 
movie never lets up. Apart from 
certain narrative beats relating 
to Poirot’s deceased wife, no 
revelation or twist falls flat. 
Poirot’s 
personal 
storyline 

feels half-hearted at best, but 
truthfully that’s not what we’re 
here for anyways, and the 
time it would’ve taken to more 
thoroughly 
develop 
Poirot’s 

back-story feels like time the 

film doesn’t have. There’s so 
much mystery to get through 
and so many characters with 
secret 
identities 
and 
false 

histories and long lost relatives 
to uncover that the movie 
doesn’t have time for the simple 
personal 
story 
surrounding 

Poirot. Because of this his final 
decision, meant to represent a 
big change for his character, 
feels slightly underwhelming, 
if only because the overall 
solution to the central mystery 
feels so satisfying in contrast.

The 
production 
design 

and overall look and feel of 
the film couldn’t be more 
perfectly suited for the story 
being told. Cinematographer 
Haris Zambarloukos (“Denial”) 
makes creative use of the 
train setting to produce some 
seriously dynamic shots and 
sequences. In particular is 
the use of overhead shots to 
emphasize 
the 
“Clue”-like 

atmosphere 
that 
develops 

throughout the picture. The 
music by Patrick Doyle (“The 
Emoji 
Movie”) 
is 
suitably 

whimsical and mysterious in 
parts, fitting for the tonal shifts 
that occur during the length of 
the feature.

“Murder 
on 
the 
Orient 

Express” might not reinvent 
the wheel, but it does what it 
does very well, providing an 
entertaining murder mystery 
with a wonderful cast who ham 
it up as much as they can. It’s 
clear that everyone involved 
with the picture was having a 
damn good time. By the time 
the credits roll, everyone in the 
audience will be too.

BOOK REVIEW
‘The Doll’s Alphabet’ an 
enjoyably grotesque read

Grudova’s collection of stories leaves the reader’s skin crawling

Camilla 
Grudova’s 
“The 

Doll’s Alphabet” is a deeply 
weird and completely brilliant 
book. 
You 
find 
its 
images 

replaying in your head on an 
endless loop long after turning 
the final page, and for good 
reason: It’s kind of terrifying. 
Women unstitch their own skin 
clean off their bones, they turn 
into werewolves and eat their 
own children, and they give 
birth to alien tubers (eyeless 
and mouthless, but nonetheless 
alive and squirming). There’s a 
sewing machine powered by the 
blood of the young seamstresses 

using it — and a grotesque half 
spider/half man obsessed with 
keeping the machine alive at 
any cost.

The stories rarely follow a 

clear narrative path, but they 
make an awful visceral sense, 
pulsing with the internal logic 
of a nightmare. They’re distinct, 
but the stories share a world 
filled with rot, decay, rusty 
machines 
and 
bloody 
open 

wounds. Grudova’s characters 
are rarely heroes; they form dark 
fixations and obsessions that 
tear their lives apart. Sometimes 
they’re 
literal 
monsters, 

sometimes they’re just people 
in a bad situation — but they 
always feel real, lived-in. The 
characters are often just barely 
scraping by, living on carefully 

rationed food in tins and selling 
their very bodies to survive. 
There’s 
a 
vague 
dystopian 

atmosphere 
permeating 
the 

whole collection, but we never 
find out exactly what happened. 

In fact, a lot of the book’s world is 
sketched out through carefully-
chosen but sparse details, where 
we’re left to fill in the rest 
ourselves. But this is intentional, 
a 
classic 
horror 
technique: 

There’s nothing scarier than the 
unspoken.

Grudova’s 
writing 
has 
a 

rhythm to it, a perfectly even 
rise and fall that is equal parts 
graceful 
and 
hair-raisingly 

creepy. The first story in the book 
opens with a casual narration: 
“One afternoon, after finishing 
a cup of coffee in her living 
room, Greta discovered how to 
unstitch herself. Her clothes, 
skin and hair fell from her like 
the peeled rind of a fruit, and her 
true body stepped out.” As you 
keep reading, you find yourself 
simultaneously mesmerized by 
the cadence and meter of the 
writing, and completely repulsed 
by the contents.

But Grudova is too smart to 

disgust her readers without 
a purpose. Every harrowing 
description, 
every 
piece 
of 

brutal body horror has a clear 
focus. At its core, this is a book 
about the danger and existential 
panic 
contained 
within 

women’s bodies. It’s a vivid 

externalization of female pain 
and anger. 

In “The Mouse Queen,” our 

protagonist starts transforming 
into 
a 
werewolf 
after 
her 

husband leaves her alone to raise 
their twin baby boys. She goes 

out every night, eating women 
and children and all the other 
vulnerable people she can find. 
There’s “The Sad Tale of the 
Sconce,” which starts with a 
wooden mermaid who has been 
carved into the masthead of a 
ship, until the sailors, “... ate 
her lips, her hair, her shoulders, 
and, using a knife, gave her the 

anatomy a mermaid does not 
have.”

Or 
there’s 
“Unstitched,” 

the short tale that opens the 
collection, about women learning 
to tear their skin off to reveal a 
secret, more truthful self within. 
“Men were divided,” she writes, 
“between those who ‘always 
knew 
there 
was 
something 

deceitful about women’ ... and 
those who lamented ‘the loss 
of the female form.’” Grudova 
is angry, with the kind of anger 
that’s never quite made explicit. 
It boils under the surface of 
everything she writes. “The 
Doll’s Alphabet” is a tribute to 
the fact that women are brutally 
hurt all the time — and too often, 
nobody cares.

It’s a testament to Grudova’s 

skill that it never feels heavy-
handed, it only ever feels true. 
And that’s really what makes 
“The Doll’s Alphabet” induce 
goosebumps: it’s giving voice 
and form to a barely-contained 
rage, and a very real violence.

“Do not come here by yourself 

again,” a man tells a young girl 
in “Edward, Do Not Pamper the 
Dead.” “Remember you are a 
vulnerable person.”

It’s a familiar warning.

ART NOTEBOOK

RUBENS

The Battle of Anghiari, copy by Peter Paul Rubens
The mystery of Leonardo 
da Vinci’s lost masterpiece

Writer Trina Pal takes us through one of art’s greatest mysteries: 
the tenuous connection between Vasari and Leonardo da Vinci

As I stared up at Giorgio 

Vasari’s painting, The battle 
of Marciano in Val di Chiana, 
uncontrollable chills traveled 
down my spine. I couldn’t 
believe 
that 
Leonardo 
da 

Vinci’s most revered work 
during his lifetime was right 
beneath this 43 by 25 ft fresco. 
And I’m most definitely not 
talking Mona Lisa.

I was standing in the largest 

political hall in Italy, the 
Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. 
Six similar frescoes depicting 
battle scenes ornamented the 
walls of the room, all requiring 
me to crane my neck to glimpse 
the tops. A family trip had led 
me to Italy, but as I looked up at 
the famous fresco, there didn’t 
seem to be anyone else in the 
room. All I knew was myself, 
soaking in the mystery of the 
lost masterpiece, The Battle of 
Anghiari, that was rumored to 
be behind these walls.

When it was painted in 1505, 

The Battle of Anghiari was 
regarded as the best work by 
Leonardo da Vinci, arguably 
the most well-known painter 
of the Renaissance era and 
today. This one battle scene, 
commissioned 
by 
Italian 

statesman Piero Soderini to be 
painted in the Palazzo Vecchio, 
was said to surpass any other 
painting produced during the 
Renaissance. A century later, 
however, 
painter 
Giorgio 

Vasari was told to paint over 
it by the Grand Duke Cosimo 

I. After this, there are no 
known records of The Battle of 
Anghiari. Art historians knew 
it should rest in the Palazzo 
Vecchio, but found nothing 
more than copied sketches 
by Peter Paul Rubens and da 
Vinci himself. Nothing could 
point them to the original.

But 
five 
years 
ago, 

everything changed. In March 
2012, 
Italian 
art 
analyst 

Maurizio Seracini discovered 
that Vasari’s painting actually 
rested on a thin wall about 

one to three inches in front 
of the rest of the paintings in 
the gallery. By controversially 
drilling small holes into parts 
of Vasari’s painting, Seracini 
discovered pigments behind 
this 
wall. 
After 
further 

analysis, it was found that da 
Vinci had used these same 
pigments in many of his other 
works. Not having the heart to 
destroy Leonardo’s acclaimed 
work, Vasari had built a thin 
wall over the original painting 

before painting himself. 

What’s the big fuss, you 

ask? What about this could 
cause me to feel as if I was 
in 
an 
alternate 
universe, 

standing in this grand gallery 
on this particular hot August 
afternoon? 
It’s 
simple. 
I’d 

even brought binoculars in 
preparation. 
Nothing 
was 

going to take away from this 
life changing moment, and 
nothing did.

I’ve never cared much for 

Vasari as a painter. I will, 
however, attest to the man’s 
ingenuity. Vasari, reluctant to 
paint over Leonardo’s work 
and knowing that historians 
would be searching for it 
centuries later, had included 
a vital clue in his painting. On 
one of the green flags about 
20 feet up, lost in the chaos of 
the Battle of Marciano in Val 
di Chiana, he had painted the 
words “Cerca Trova” in white 
paint. In other words, “Seek, 
and ye shall find.” It’s amazing 
that art historians didn’t find 
it earlier.

I’ve 
never 
shaken 
off 

this day of discovery. I was 
amazed these words weren’t 
found centuries earlier. This 
inscription was written on a 
painting in a room where The 
Battle of Anghiari was said to 
have existed, yet no one had 
pieced together the clues until 
five years ago.

I’ve come to two conclusions. 

One: The mysteries I always 
classified as the realm of 
fiction novels can manifest 
themselves in reality, and they 
can do so in a way that sucks

the breath right out of you. 
You’re left feeling as if you 
didn’t truly deserve to witness 
this moment, to see the stars 
align right in front of you. 
Two: Sometimes we don’t see 
what’s right under our noses. 
But I’m not complaining — 
had this been found centuries 
earlier, I wouldn’t have been as 
beautifully spellbound as I was 
four years ago.

The Battle of Anghiari will 

likely never be recovered. In 
order to do so, Vasari’s painting 
would have to be destroyed, 
and it’s very probable that da 
Vinci’s painting would emerge 

in a damaged condition. As an 
art enthusiast, I’m devastated 
The Battle of Anghiari won’t 
ever be seen by myself or 
the public. It’s almost more 
distressing, however, that most 
people will never know this 
painting.

It seems than an art piece 

lost isn’t as painful as an art 
piece undiscovered. Since The 
Battle of Anghiari is the latter, 
it’s as if a huge part of da Vinci’s 
reputation never existed. It 
brings up the controversial 
question: Is it just to destroy a 
“lesser” piece of art to recover 
a more famous work? As much 

as I’d love to revel in the 
glory of da Vinci’s painting, 
I couldn’t justify destroying 
another piece of art to do so.

Regardless, seeing the words 

“Cerca Trova” with my own 
eyes was an experience that 
transcended all my previous 
notions 
of 
self-discovery. 

When I close my eyes, I can 
still see the white, fine printed 
words etched in my mind.

“Seek, and ye shall find.”
 I wonder what else I’ll 

discover if I disregard the 
apparent and dive into the 
unexplored.

Final Foes: Previewing the NCAA Tournament Final Four

In 
the 
early 
rounds 
of 

the 
NCAA 
Tournament, 

the 
Michigan 
field 
hockey 

team proved it was up to the 
challenge. 
The 
Wolverines 

dispatched 
Syracuse 
and 

Northwestern to advance to the 
semifinals. 

Michigan is coming in hot — 

not allowing a single goal in the 
postseason so far — but the Final 
Four will be its biggest test yet. 
The Daily broke down potential 
matchups for the Wolverines 
this weekend in Louisville.

No. 3 Michigan vs. No. 9 

Maryland

Prior 
to 
its 
3-2 
double-

overtime win in September, 
Michigan had failed to defeat 
the Terrapins in 15 years. That 
time, it clinched a national 
championship. So it seems only 
fitting that the Wolverines will 
have to get through Maryland 
one more time.

The Terrapins defeated No. 

13 Wake Forest in the round 
of 16, 2-0, then upset No. 2 
Duke in the quarterfinals, 3-2, 
to advance to the semifinals. 
There, Michigan awaits.

Maryland, a traditional field 

hockey powerhouse, brings a 
well-balanced attack. It ranks 
18th in the nation in goals per 
game and 13th in goals-against 
average. 
Midfielder 
Lein 

Holsboer led the Terrapins in 
goals scored and assists. She 
was named to the All-Big Ten 
First Team and the All-Big Ten 
Tournament team.

The Wolverines face a big 

threat in Holsboer, who scored 
one of Maryland’s two goals in 
its earlier matchup. However, 
as the season progressed, the 
Wolverines 
have 
improved 

their strategies for overcoming 
those challenges. Michigan will 
seek to neutralize Holsboer 
with its dynamic back line of 
freshman Halle O’Neill, junior 
Maggie 
Bettez 
and 
senior 

Katie Trombetta – the Big Ten 
Player of the Year. Look for the 
Wolverines to utilize a 2-on-1 
defensive formation for extra 
protection.

Leading Michigan’s offense 

on the forward line are fifth-
year senior Carly Bennett, junior 
Emma Way and sophomore Meg 
Dowthwaite. They contributed 
to a squad that ranked 11th in 
the nation in goals per game. 
On offense, the Wolverines are 
fast and confident, but their 
real strength comes from their 
passing. To keep Michigan off 
the board, the Terrapins will 
need to be as aggressive with 
their 
blocking 
as 
Syracuse 

was in the NCAA Tournament 
quarterfinal.

Maryland led the conference 

in shots, and it will look to 
overwhelm 
its 
opposition 

with sheer quantity. In senior 
goalkeeper Sam Swenson – 
the national leader in save 
percentage – the Wolverines 
have just the person for the job.

The Terrapins are a team 

with no real weaknesses, but 
Michigan is ranked better in 
all aspects of the game, making 
this match the Wolverines’ to 
lose.

If Michigan does advance 

past Maryland, it will advance 
to the title game, where it 
will face one of two potential 
opponents.

Michigan vs. No. 4 North 

Carolina

North 
Carolina 
is 
the 

underdog in its semifinal match 
against 
Connecticut, 
but 
if 

Michigan advances to the title 
game, it should hope the Tar 
Heels are there waiting.

That said, North Carolina 

is no slouch. The Tar Heels 
outscored 
their 
opponents 

8-2 in their run to the ACC 
Tournament championship and 
earned the fourth overall seed 
in the NCAA Tournament.

North 
Carolina 
does 

everything 
well. 
It 
ranks 

sixth in the nation with 3.82 

goals per game, a feat more 
impressive when considering 
its 
competitive 
conference. 

Rather than one standout on 
offense, North Carolina has 
remarkable depth. Seven of its 
players had five or more goals 
on the season, with midfielders 
Ashley Hoffman and Malin 
Evert leading the tally at 11 
apiece.

A leading scorer who also 

plays defense, Hoffman will be 
a different look for Michigan. 
Planning 
an 
offensive 
and 

defensive 
attack 
will 
be 

tough against a team with so 
many hybrid players, but the 
Wolverines come in with the 
advantage of having seen the 
Tar Heels before. Michigan 
won its season opener against 
North Carolina, 3-2.

Since then, both teams have 

improved. But the Tar Heels 
may be in for a big surprise with 
the look of the Wolverines’ back 
line. Neither O’Neill nor Bettez 
started the season opener, but 
both have come into their own 
as vital pieces of Michigan’s 
defense.

Perhaps the biggest change 

has 
been 
the 
Wolverines’ 

approach to penalty corners. 
They struggled with defending 
corners in the early part of the 
season, and North Carolina took 
advantage in its first match. But 
the personnel change, along 
with a focus on corner defense 
in practice, has led Michigan to 
be much stingier with allowing 
goals — posting 15 shutouts in 
its last 18 games.

The Wolverines have been 

able to formulate a defensive 
plan of attack for all types of 
offenses, an ability that will be 
more crucial than ever against 
North Carolina. If these teams 
play in the title game, it will be 
closely-fought and low-scoring. 
However, Michigan’s previous 
success against the Tar Heels 
and 
much-improved 
defense 

should make it a slight favorite.

Michigan 
vs. 
No. 
1 

Connecticut

Connecticut 
is 
still 

undefeated 
at 
21-0. 
The 

Wolverines lead the nation in 
goals allowed per game, and the 
Huskies lead in goals scored.

This matchup, if it happens, 

will be a clash of the titans.

Connecticut 
has 
been 

unstoppable all year. The 
American Athletic Conference 
may not be as competitive as 
the Big Ten or ACC, but the 
Huskies 
beat 
top-10 
teams 

Northwestern, Penn State and 
Michigan.

Forward Charlotte Veitner 

leads the nation in goals per 
game, and three Connecticut 
players – Svea Boker, Amanda 
Collins and Casey Umstead – 
rank in the top 10 in assists. The 
Huskies’ offense is so prolific 
that they have been held to one 
goal only once this season.

The 
two 
teams 
met 
in 

September and the Huskies 
came out on top, 2-1. However, 
like the North Carolina match, 

this game was early in the 
season, when both teams were 
still developing their identities. 
It was an evenly-matched game, 
with the ultimate advantage 
for Connecticut coming on a 
goal scored off a penalty stroke. 
Michigan 
has 
not 
allowed 

another this season.

The other two goals came 

off penalty corners. While both 
teams have strong defense on 
corners, they may provide the 
best scoring opportunity in a 
match between two top back 
lines. The Huskies may be 
more poised to take advantage, 
as one of the Wolverines’ few 
weaknesses in the postseason 
has been giving up corners. 
It will be up to Michigan to 
strike a balance between being 
conscientious 
of 
giving 
up 

corners while not becoming too 
passive.

If the Huskies have any 

cracks in their foundation, it 
is their recent performance. 
Connecticut 
gave 
up 
four 

goals in its first two NCAA 
Tournament matches against 
Boston 
University 
and 

Penn State. Meanwhile, the 
Wolverines earned shutouts in 
each of their first two games. 
It could be a fluke for the 
Huskies or it could be a product 
of 
unfamiliarity 
with 
the 

competition — one disadvantage 
of a smaller conference.

Still, it’s hard not to give the 

upper hand to Connecticut. 
Michigan’s 
offense 
has 

struggled against elite defensive 
units such as Syracuse and 
Penn State, from which the 
Huskies would be a step up. And 
while the Wolverines’ defense 
has thus far been prepared 
for 
anything, 
no 
previous 

opponent has received offensive 
production from quite as many 
sources.

Two teams that seem near 

unstoppable, with only one of 
them emerging as champion. 
This is the matchup the NCAA 
Tournament deserves.

Defensive zone key ahead of Wisconsin

During the first period of its Big 

Ten home opener against then-
No. 4 Minnesota, the Michigan 
hockey team saw three viable 
scoring opportunities — but none 
broke past elite goaltender Eric 
Schierhorn.

This was a microcosm of one flaw 

in the Wolverines’ distinguished 
weekend — they struggled to find 
the net early despite creating many 
opportunities for themselves. 

“I think we had some good 

chances,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “And sometimes you 
finish and some you don’t.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

eventually triumphed in their 
Friday slate, the Golden Gophers 
built a dangerous scoring cushion 
early on. Right after the first 
intermission, they put three on the 
board within eight minutes.

“It’s awesome that we have 

character to be able to come back 
from whatever deficit,” said junior 
forward Cooper Marody, “but it’s 
not something you want to build on 

as far as doing that every game.”

Pearson mirrored this sentiment, 

emphasizing that playing behind 
with three-or four-goal deficits 
will not be a sustainable practice 
moving forward.

And his solution to this problem? 

Don’t get so far behind in the first 
place.

“You can’t continue to play from 

behind,” Pearson said. “I think 
(we need) more preparation, and 
attention to detail defensively. 
We’ve got to be better defensively; 
you can’t give anything up until you 
get something going.”

This week in practices, Michigan 

has put a greater emphasis on 
the defensive zone, focusing its 
attention on odd-man rushes and 
not turning the puck over the blue 
line from the neutral zone.

Minnesota’s third goal Friday 

night came when Golden Gopher 
forwards Brent Gates Jr. and Tyler 
Sheehy created an odd-man rush in 
Michigan’s zone, en route to a clean 
shot past sophomore goaltender 
Jack LaFontaine.

The following night, defensive 

lapses were responsible for another 

Minnesota goal, when defenseman 
Ryan Lindgren found a breakaway, 
bringing the Golden Gopher lead to 
3-0.

With more direct attention 

to 
these 
game-like 
defensive 

scenarios, Pearson believes the 
Wolverines can curb the number 
of scoring opportunities for their 
opposition.

He largely sees this lack of 

attention 
on 
defensive 
play 

stemming from how defense is 
treated from the time hockey 
players begin their careers.

“From the time you’re raised 

up in hockey, you get home and 
the first question your parents 
or grandparents ask is ‘Did you 
win and how many goals did you 
score?’” Pearson said. “It’s not 
‘Did you block a shot?’ or ‘How 
well defensively did you do?’ It’s 
all about offense. It’s ingrained. So 
we’ve got to change that.”

This mentality, since almost 

innate, can take time to change. 
However, Pearson believes the 
defensive tweaks his team needs to 
make won’t be major, as they tend 
to be representative of individual 

mistakes and not holistic issues.

“I will say of the goals we gave up 

(this weekend) everything can be 
changed,” Pearson said. “It wasn’t a 
total breakdown of the system.”

Michigan sees the responsibility 

of protecting its net as a duty of 
the entire team, and not solely the 
responsibility of its defensemen 
and goaltenders. 

“If one of your five guys on the 

ice messes up, you’re in trouble,” 
Pearson said. “You’re in trouble of 
giving up a goal.”

Sharpening 
the 
defense 

this week could see an almost 
immediate effect, as Michigan’s 
upcoming series is against another 
top dog with a hot offense: No. 
9 Wisconsin. The Badgers have 
netted at least one goal during the 
first period in each of their seven 
wins this season — notably scoring 
three before the first intermission 
Friday against Michigan State.

If the Wolverines are able to 

reduce these offensive efforts, 
they will leave more room to get 
ahead early, and not have to worry 
again about making extraordinary 
comebacks. 

Intangibles key for ‘M’

It’s not always glamor that 

wins the game.

In the No. 24 Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

74-50 blowout against Liberty, 
the Wolverines relied on a 
strong 
performance 
from 

the free throw line – a major 
differentiator in the game. The 
Lady Flames got to the line 
just 14 times and converted 
on just six free throws. On the 
other hand, Michigan shot 21 
of 26 from the charity stripe.

As junior shooting guard 

Nicole Munger explained, the 
team focused on free throws 
during this offseason.

“We ran a lot from missed 

free throws,” Munger said 
with a laugh. “And now they’re 
going in, and it’s paying off and 
we’re (also) in good condition. 
We worked a lot in practice 
and by ourselves just because 
we know they’re free points.”

And an improvement from 

the free throw line has been 
evident in Michigan’s young 
season. The Wolverines were 
18 of 21 from the line in their 
season opener against George 
Mason. While just two games 
in, the team has averaged 23.5 
free throw attempts, up from 
16.8 last season.

“We just did a good job 

of moving the ball,” said 
freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown. “With that, we found 
ways to draw fouls. Whether 
that be a dish and then an and-
one, or a drive and attack. We 
were able to put people in the 
right positions to finish and 
draw fouls.”

The 
first 
half 
saw 
a 

particularly high number of 
fouls, with Liberty committing 
14 to Michigan’s nine. Twenty-
four of the Wolverines’ free 
throw attempts came within 
the first two quarters. This 
was, in large part, a byproduct 
of Michigan’s ability to get 

into the bonus early in the 
quarter. 

“We did a great job on 

drawing fouls early by picking 
up touch fouls,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “And 
that brought us to the line. I 
thought that’s really what gave 
us our lead – when Katelynn 
(Flaherty) was able to get to 
the line so early.”

To 
no 
one’s 
surprise, 

Flaherty converted on those 
opportunities, 
shooting 
a 

perfect 10 for 10. She finished 
the game with 20 points – 
only nine shy of becoming 
Michigan’s all-time leading 
scorer.

Barnes Arico also explained 

that getting the right players – 
like Flaherty and senior center 
Hallie Thome – to the line has 
contributed to the Wolverines 
success.

The impressive free throw 

display wasn’t the only thing 
that stood out, as the defense 
was equally impressive. By 
allowing 50 points, Michigan 
far 
outshined 
its 
2016-17 

average of 61.8 points allowed 
per game.

“We started off in our 

zone, and I think it was 
very effective,” Brown said. 
“Whether it was the 22 press 
or falling back to the two-
three … our zone did a good 
job of putting pressure. I think 
with our length we can cause 
a lot of havoc for the other 
players.”

The full court press was a key 

tactic for the Wolverines. The 
game plan was implemented by 
assistant coach Wesley Brooks 
and forced the Lady Flames 
to speed up the game, helping 
Michigan force 22 turnovers.

In 
the 
semifinals 
of 

the 
Preseason 
WNIT, 
the 

Wolverines are likely to play 
No. 9 Louisville. In order 
for Michigan to overcome a 
stout Cardinals team, these 
unglamorous 
areas 
must 

continue to be a focus.

Slow starts are fixable 
for young Wolverines

Though 2-0, the Michigan 

basketball team hasn’t had the 
start it anticipated.

Against 
less-talented 
and 

undersized 
teams 
in 
North 

Florida and Central Michigan, the 
Wolverines were expected to roll. 

But that wasn’t the case. 
Michigan came out flat against 

both 
opponents, 
leading 
to 

closer-than-anticipated contests. 
Saturday, North Florida trailed by 
just two at the half and remained 
within single digits until roughly 
seven minutes remained.

Central Michigan, meanwhile, 

led by as many as 8 points during 
a first half it largely controlled 
Monday night.

“We thought the other day that 

(our players) warmed up really 
slow, and we weren’t as into it,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“We were fired up to come out 
and play today. Assistant coaches 
did a great job in the locker room. 
We were fired up – didn’t make a 
difference.”

Conventionally, this wouldn’t 

be an encouraging trend for a 
team looking to make back-to-back 
Sweet 16 appearances. But the 
Wolverines’ slow starts shouldn’t 
be a cause for concern and – to an 
extent – are understandable.

For one, both the Ospreys and 

Chippewas play zone defenses – 
a strategy that just a few college 
basketball teams utilize. Adjusting 
is a challenge, even for Beilein.

“First of all, this is a first,” 

Beilein said. “In 1,200 games as 
a head coach, I think you add up 
high school, it’s probably 1,200 — 
80 minutes of zone in two games. 
What they’re doing is they’re 
trying to negate a lot of what we 
can do man-to-man.”

Added junior forward Moritz 

Wagner: “They played zone, so 
that kind of trumps everything a 
little bit because you’ve got to think 
completely differently. You’ve got 
to think differently than you’re 
naturally supposed to.”

It takes time to feel out a zone 

defense, and Michigan’s offensive 
attack proved that.

Michigan committed four of its 

six total turnovers against Central 
Michigan within the contest’s first 
seven minutes. And through nearly 
10 minutes of action Saturday, the 
Wolverines tallied just nine points.

Simply, in the early parts of 

games, Michigan’s offense has 
looked out of rhythm – an issue 
Beilein hopes will be fixed with 
more aggressive basketball.

“We’re passing, we’re passing, 

we’re 
passing,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“We’ve got to drive the ball. We’ve 
got to get two feet in the paint.”

Inexperience also has its part, 

too.

With three new starters, the 

Wolverines’ offense won’t be 
prominent immediately.

“It’s going to take a little time 

to gel,” Robinson said. “We gotta 
get used to each other. We’ve got 
young guys, obviously, but we’ve 
got to be a little bit better out of the 
gate.”

Michigan fans should also take 

solace in the fact that Monday’s 
shooting 
numbers 
are 
not 

representative of a normal game. 

Few 
opponents 
will 
shoot 

as well as the Chippewas did 
from deep – 10 3-pointers on 42 
percent shooting. The Wolverines, 
meanwhile, shot just 29 percent 
outside the perimeter. Fifth-year 
senior forward Duncan Robinson 
– a consistent marksman – went an 
ugly 2-for-8. 

But 
to 
start 
strongly 
in 

Michigan’s next game Thursday 
against 
Southern 
Mississippi, 

Robinson knows the other end of 
the floor takes precedent. 

“Probably defensive, first and 

foremost,” Robinson said. “The 
ability to get stops. I think shots 
will fall some games more than 
others. Tonight, especially that 
first half, they weren’t. You count 
on them, but you’ve got to (be able 
to) count on defense.

“Those first four minutes – 

those ‘four-minute wars’ we call 
them – we’ve got to come out and 
try to swing first. That’s going to be 
a priority for us.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
For Metellus, blocked punt eases earlier stress

Josh Metellus relieved some 

stress this past Saturday. 

The sophomore safety said 

Tuesday night that he’s been 
practicing blocking punts all 
year and worried about whether 
he would ever do it in a game.

He finally did in the second 

quarter of Michigan’s 35-10 win 
over Maryland. It “felt soothing,” 
according to Metellus.

That relief may not have 

compared to what he felt early last 
week, when Metellus discovered 
he was eligible to play in the first 
half against the Terrapins.

In the third quarter of the 

Wolverines’ 
33-10 
win 
over 

Minnesota on Nov. 4, Metellus 
found himself in a scrum after 
the whistle. Golden Gopher 
lineman Donnell Greene threw 
a punch at junior safety Tyree 
Kinnel. Metellus walked over, 
stood in front of Greene and 
promptly found himself ejected 
for unsportsmanlike conduct.

The call didn’t sit well with 

Jim Harbaugh, who said last 

week that “it didn’t really have a 
lot of logic to it.”

“It didn’t seem like he threw 

a punch,” Harbaugh later said 
of the incident. “There was a 
scrum, the official said there was 
a scrum and they weren’t going 
to lose control of the game, so 
there were off-setting penalties.”

Metellus 
didn’t 
think 
he 

did anything wrong. He said 
Tuesday that he was “just trying 
to protect his teammate.”

“Coach told me next time, just 

don’t go over there,” Metellus 
said. “Just stay back. We already 
got the flag. There’s no reason to 
go over there to start something.”

He 
understood 
why 
the 

officials threw him out of the 
game, though, and was more 
worried about whether he’d be 
available for the first half of the 
Maryland game. But that wasn’t 
immediately made clear.

The rules state that any player 

ejected for targeting in the 
second half of a game must sit 
out the first half of the following 
contest. Metellus wasn’t called 
for 
targeting. 
But 
he 
was 

worried nonetheless whether a 

suspension would carry over.

In fact, he was so worried that 

was the first thing he checked 
once he returned to the locker 
room.

“I didn’t even take a shower,” 

Metellus said. “I just grabbed my 
phone and started Googling. I 
couldn’t find an answer.”

He found company in the 

training 
room 
in 
freshman 

receiver Nico Collins, who had 
injured his ankle during the 
game. Collins asked Metellus if 
he was suspended for Maryland. 
Metellus told Collins he had 
actually meant to ask him the 
same question.

The next day, people started 

calling Metellus, asking him 
about the incident and what it 
meant for Maryland. Metellus 
didn’t know the answer.

The 
whole 
situation 
was 

“funny” to teammate and close 
friend Devin Bush Jr.

“We were just joking about it,” 

Bush said. “Making fun of him — 
that he got kicked out the game.”

The 
mystery 
continued 

through the weekend. Metellus 
went 
to 
Schembechler 
Hall 

on Sunday, hoping to find the 
coaching staff. They weren’t 
around, and no one else he asked 
knew the answer either. The 
next day, he asked Harbaugh. 
Harbaugh didn’t know. And at 
that point, Metellus got pretty 
worried.

“I was just sitting there like, 

‘Damn, I probably am kicked 
out,’ ” Metellus said. “ ‘If they 
don’t know by now, I’m probably 
not going to play the first half.’ ”

But it didn’t take much longer 

for the situation to be resolved. 
After 
Monday’s 
practice, 

Harbaugh pulled Metellus aside 
and told him he wouldn’t miss 
any time.

So his burden was lifted — and 

luckily so for Metellus. After all, 
his blocked punt came in the 
second quarter. Had he been 
suspended, he would’ve still 
been worrying about blocking 
his first.

“Yeah, it just calmed me 

down,” Metellus said of the 
play. “I was stressing about 
getting one this whole season 
and I finally got it, so I just let 
everything go.”

Evans now avoiding ‘sophomore slump’

Chris Evans had never heard 

the term ‘sophomore slump’ 
before Tuesday night.

But Jim Harbaugh was still 

worried the sophomore running 
back would have one.

After a freshman campaign 

that 
Harbaugh 
called 

“outstanding,” it wouldn’t be 
easy for Evans to top it his 
second time around. In 2016, 
Evans ran for 617 yards and four 
touchdowns. Over the offseason, 
fans and media speculated that 
he’d be Michigan’s top running 
back this year.

But as the first few games 

of the season came around, 
Evans lost the starting role. He 
rushed for just 123 yards in the 
first three games and fumbled 
during that stretch against Air 
Force. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
Ty 

Isaac surged, and junior Karan 
Higdon seemed to get the right 
blocks every time he had a play 
called for him.

“The plays weren’t blocked 

as well, and the assignments 
weren’t on point when (Evans) 
was in the game,” Harbaugh said 
Monday. “Then Karan would get 
in, and it was kind of the luck of 
the draw with the hand that he 
was dealt.”

Evans 
was 
just 
getting 

unlucky. He’d get a turn in the 
rotation to run, but the offensive 
line didn’t develop the blocks he 
needed.

It was frustrating, but he 

couldn’t predict how the blocks 
would pan out, so he didn’t let it 
get to him. It took more than a 
few games for Evans’ impact to 
really show.

“About game seven, eight, 

nine it started evening out,” 
Harbaugh said.

That it did. Evans began 

getting more carries, and the 
results began to show. Against 
Rutgers — game seven — he 
caught 
redshirt 
freshman 

quarterback 
Brandon 
Peters’ 

first 
touchdown. 
Against 

Minnesota, he rushed for two 

touchdowns 
and 
191 
yards. 

And this last weekend versus 
Maryland, he tallied another 
pair of rushing touchdowns in 
the Wolverines’ third straight 
win.

The 
running 
back’s 

production, 
as 
Harbaugh 

realized, was really just a 
matter of time. Harbaugh had 
watched the tape of Evans’ first 
few games, and the running 
back hadn’t really been doing 
anything wrong.

“Yeah, it’s frustrating, but as a 

running back, you can’t predict 
how (the blocks) are going to 
be,” Evans said. “You just got to 
go in there and trust it and go 
hard at the end.”

Evans gained momentum over 

the last couple of weeks, earning 
praise 
from 
Harbaugh 
for 

making plays out of situations 
where the blocks didn’t come 
together. Harbaugh said that he 
likes the way Evans is running, 
catching out of the backfield, 
getting yards after contact and 
blocking as well.

“I just went into the season 

giving everything I got,” Evans 
said.

Earning playing time on a 

running back rotation with 
three key players — and a 
fourth emerging with redshirt 
freshman Kareem Walker — 
would be no easy task.

Evans, who splits carries 

evenly with Isaac and Higdon, 
said that he can’t have a selfish 
mindset. He understands that he 
might not rush for a 1,000-yard 
season when he only gets a third 
of the carries.

His counterpart this weekend, 

though, can’t say the same.

Wisconsin 
running 
back 

Jonathon Taylor is having the 
freshman season a running back 
can only dream about.

With 1,525 yards through 

the first 10 games, Taylor leads 
the Big Ten. He has run for 12 
touchdowns and averages seven 
yards per carry, and plays a 
critical part of the fifth-ranked 
Badgers’ offense.

He’s 
responsible 
for 
46 

percent of Wisconsin’s rushing 
attempts, and the other 54 
percent is split between 14 
different players. As the lead 
rusher, and a solid rusher at 
that, Taylor was bound to have a 
stellar season.

Evans admits that Taylor “is a 

great player,” but knows that his 
situation is different here in Ann 
Arbor than Taylor’s in Madison.

“We can’t be selfish,” Evans 

said of his teammates. “Like, 
‘Man, I wish I got all the carries, 
and I wish I rushed for 1,500 just 
like (Taylor).’ ”

He 
doesn’t 
have 
the 

opportunity Taylor does. Evans 
has never been and probably 
won’t ever be the only running 
back that Michigan relies on. 
He’ll keep sharing carries, and 
there will undoubtedly be plays 
he takes where the blocks don’t 
arrive.

But on the plays where the 

blocks do arrive, it’s up to Evans 
to make the most of them.

Munger continues 
thriving in her role

Always involved and always 

doing her job — Nicole Munger 
has a key role on the Michigan 
women’s basketball team, but 
is often in the shadows of her 
teammates.

After all, it can be quite 

challenging to stand out when 
sharing the backcourt with senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty — the 
program’s 
soon-to-be 
all-time 

leading scorer. Some would take 
the easy way out by relying on 
the stars, while others would be 
discouraged and would throw in 
the towel.

But not Munger.
The junior guard plays a 

crucial role for the team and 
is an important piece to the 
Wolverines’ 
puzzle. 
She 
has 

received substantial playing time 
ever since joining the squad, and 
she found her spot in the starting 
lineup this season. Yet Munger is 
seldom in the spotlight.

Flaherty is a talented scorer 

who has keys to the offense. 
Junior 
center 
Hallie 
Thome 

controls the paint and often gets 
big blocks. Both have started for 
the majority of their careers and 
the fans and critics regularly take 
notice. But Munger shines too 
— she just doesn’t get the same 
glamour.

Munger is a reliable player who 

is always ready when the team 
needs her. She’s played an integral 
role in Michigan’s first two games 
this season against George Mason 
and Liberty, and has tallied 27 
points, seven rebounds and four 
steals so far, all while proving to 
be effective beyond the arc as well.

She put her hustle on display 

against Liberty. Early in the 
third quarter, an opposing player 
held the ball near the top of the 
key when, suddenly, Munger 

lunged forward, stripping the 
ball and causing havoc. The 
opposing player partially regained 
possession but Munger wasn’t 
done yet. She dove to the ground 
and fought to force a jump ball, 
switching the possession to the 
Wolverines.

There was no need for Munger 

to put herself on the line given the 
scenario at that time. Michigan 
was returning from a dominant 
first half and led 46-26. She 
could have gotten comfortable, 
but 
gritty 
basketball 
players 

like Munger never do the bare 
minimum.

She was a difference maker in 

the WNIT championship game 
last spring too. The Wolverines 
went into triple overtime against 
Georgia Tech when she stepped 
up, scoring seven points in the 
final overtime to help her team 
win its first banner.

She was clutch then and 

could be clutch this season too, 
as Michigan dreams of making 
it to the NCAA Tournament in 
March. She is exactly the type of 
hardworking, reliable player who 
could make the team’s dreams 
come true, and it’d be a lie if the 
tournament wasn’t on her mind 
too.

“There’s a lot that goes into a 

season, but I definitely think the 
tournament is what our eyes are 
set on,” Munger said at the team’s 
Media Day in October.

But Munger is more focused 

on the next game and the next 
possession, and will continue 
to provide the Wolverines the 
foundation they need.

“ … We have — I don’t even 

know — 25 games before that, so 
we have to execute from today, to 
tomorrow, to every day,” Munger 
said. “And hopefully we can 
just take it one day at a time and 
hopefully by the end of the season 
our name will be called.”

An International Village
for Ypsilanti?


I 

knew 
I 
was 

attracted to men 
before I knew I was 
Attracted To Men. 

It began at my summer 
camp, 
a 
small 
wooded 

refuge 
tucked 
away 
in 

northern Wisconsin. There, 
one or two hundred boys or 
so, from age 9 to 15, played, 
swam, 
canoed, 
sailed, 

crafted, cooked, gathered, 
laughed, cried. I crushed. (I 
did those other things, too.)

I didn’t know how to 

describe it, so I didn’t. I 
let it smolder, carrying on 
summer after summer as 
I 
approached 
hormonal 

adolescence. We had our 
social with the girls’ camp. 
I flung a frisbee around 
with my friends. We talked 
about girls back home. “Ah, 
I’ve got no one,” I said.

I had my eyes on the older 

kids and, more commonly, 
the counselors — those 
who were spending their 
first one or two summers of 
college in rural Wisconsin, 
often 
sweating 
and 

shirtless. In recent months, 
as I sorted out my sexuality, 
both privately and publicly, 
I realized that maybe the 
reason why I didn’t like 
camp as much as the others 
was that, quite simply, I was 
surrounded by people I was 
attracted to. That’s pretty 
hard for the 36 weeks in 
total I spent as a camper 
there.

There’s a strange little 

movie that came out in 
the mid-1950s called “Tea 
and Sympathy,” which was 
adapted from a successful 
and 
controversial 
play 

that set its aim on crises 

in masculinity and gay 
panic. 
When 
the 
film 

moved from the stage to 
the screen, MGM, which 
had won the buying frenzy 
when the film’s rights were 
up for sale, struggled to 
adapt the subject material 
to something that would 
pass the stringent censors. 
Ultimately, 
the 
film’s 

focus changed from a gay 
student at an all-male prep 
school to an effeminate, but 

ultimately straight, student.

I don’t want to pass 

judgment 
on 
the 
film, 

mangled 
by 
the 
stifled 

politics of the conformist 
1950s, 
but 
“Tea 
and 

Sympathy” 
portrays 
a 

spirit and mentality rarely 
captured so painstakingly 
accurately. Protagonist Tom 
Lee’s crippling interiority 
— he is psychologically 
tormented 
for 
his 

femininity into submission 
and silence — far exceeds 
in severity my experience, 
but there are some similar 
strands. I kept to myself, 
feeling 
psychologically 

terrorized by the presence 
of the hyper-masculine.

And like Tom, I found 

myself in a strange place 
in a homosocial setting. 
I was rarely the object of 
derision, yet I couldn’t help 
but feel out of place in my 
cabin. Everyone was so 
straight. And not only was 
I not (though I didn’t quite 
have the word for it, and 
I didn’t grasp it), I was an 
introvert in a small space. 
There wasn’t much room 
for me.

One of the centerpieces of 

“Tea and Sympathy” is the 
very homoerotic (or at least 
sounding) hazing sequence, 
in which the older boys 
at the school run around 
and tear off the pajamas 
of the new students (how 
heterosexual!). Tom, called 
“sister boy” by his peers, is 
“protected” at the event by 
those who are quicker to see 
him as a woman than a man. 
I was included in activities, 
to be sure, but often my 
avoidance came from a 
sexual fear I could not at 
that time articulate. On 
the final evening of camp, 
my penultimate summer 
at least, the ninth graders 
(the oldest campers) played 
a naked basketball game. I 
avoided it at all costs.

That’s why, after watching 

“Tea and Sympathy,” I was 
surprised to find myself 
gravitating more toward 
another film, “Everybody 
Wants Some!!” Put simply, 

though the two films take 
place in similar settings, 
“Tea and Sympathy” is 
told by an outsider and 
“Everybody Wants Some!!” 
is told by an insider, a 
freshman in the baseball 
house at a Texas college 
enjoying his welcome week 
in 1980. Jake is the perfect 
freshman for (most of) the 
guys in the house: He is 
jovial, funny, pokes fun at 
the older jocks and hangs 
with the cool older guys. 
And yet he knows his place: 
He submits to the hazing 
rituals of his house, at the 
risk of losing his ability 
to have children, and he 
follows 
the 
older 
guys 

around.

But Jake thrives. And the 

best part is: He does it with 
his reserve. After the older 
guys strike out flirting with 
some girls moving into the 
dorms, one, played by Zoey 
Deutch, approaches their 
car, points to Jake and 
notes, “I like the quiet guy 
in the back seat.”

“Everybody 
Wants 

Some!!,” 
perversely 
I 

suppose, was a sort of wish 
fulfillment — an alternate 
reality in which I was 
well-liked, I was the heir 
apparent to the masculine 
reign, instead of the quiet 
kid in the corner who was 
largely 
ignored. 
It 
was 

fantasy, it was fictional, it 
was false. It was freedom.

Soundtracking: Midterms

I 

did this to myself. I have no one else to 
blame but yours truly.

I had a syllabus. I had a to-do list app on 

my phone and my laptop. I even had sticky 

notes taped to my mirror to remind me to start 
earlier. I knew having a midterm paper and an exam 
on the same day would be a recipe for disaster, but I 
didn’t think about the fact that I’m a shitty cook.

The paper has to be 1,400 to 1,500 words. The 

exam is multiple choice and free response. It’s 9 p.m. 
and I decide to head to the Hatcher Graduate Library 
Reference Room. It’s big enough where if I crawled 
under the desk and died, it would take a few days for 
someone to discover my lifeless body and arrange for 
me to take my exam in the afterlife.

On my way to the Graduate Library, I pick up a 

large black coffee and a Red Bull. I’ve never had one 
before, but it seems like a rite of passage for a small 
boy about to cram for the worst day of his life. My 
friends pulled all-nighters almost every week last 
year. The honors math track almost got the best of 
them. I’d be going to bed around midnight or 1 in 
the morning Thursday night, and I’d walk past my 
friends, their heads buried in their pages of math 
homework. “Night, guys!” I’d say as I walk past. 
They’d all look up, bags under their eyes and sadness 
radiating. I promised myself I’d never put myself 
through that form of hell. Must’ve crossed my fingers 
or something ’cause I went right ahead and broke that 
promise by waiting to start so late.

I slam my backpack on the ground in the Reference 

Room. Heads jolt up, but I’m too busy getting ready 
to face my demons to care. My coffee and Red Bull 
sitting on the desk, I open my laptop and pull up the 
study guide. In the wise words of Lil Pump, “Esketit.”

All Night — Chance the Rapper
“All night, I’ve been drinking all night, I’ve been 

drinking all night, I’ve been drinking, ay ay”

Working through my haphazard lecture notes 

and attempting to stay focused on the vocab, I keep 
sipping from my chalices, alternating between hot 
and cold. As the clock winds forward, both elixirs 
become lukewarm and gross.

I’ve been staring at this vocab sheet for three hours 

now and I still know nothing, which is a really good 
start, I’d say. Comparing my dismal notes to the 
lecture slides on Canvas, there is a clear discrepancy. 
Sometimes I think about what it was like 40 years 
ago when you had to just write down everything the 
professor said to be prepared for an exam. When 
middle schoolers who love the Rolling Stones and the 
Who say, “I was born in the wrong generation,” I don’t 
think they realize the gravity of that statement. Try 
studying for an exam without PowerPoint, kid.

I keep looking at the exam review, then my notes, 

then the slideshow. Vocab, notes, slideshow, repeat. 
These definitions make zero sense, but writing them 
down is the only hope I have at this point.

Definition — Black Star
My eyes are drooping. This can’t happen now. Wake 

up, Matt. I smack myself across the face a few times to 
jolt myself up. The girl next to me gives me the side 
eye. Nice to meet you, hardworking student who will 
probably leave way before me.

Just as I start to drift off a little, a loud bell chimes 

across the Reference Room. I look at my watch: 12:00. 
A voice rings over the speaker but no words can be 
deciphered. It sounds like a parent in a Charlie Brown 
holiday special. All I can make out is it’s midnight and 
something about University of Michigan students. He 
could be telling me everything on my exam tomorrow 
and I would never know. What a shame.

I reach for my Red Bull. Nothing. It’s empty like 

my soul at this point. Same with my coffee. A brown 
ring lines the bottom of my cup. With my body full of 
caffeine and regret, I contemplate my next move.

No Coffee — Amber Coffman
I can’t stay here anymore. I need to get out. I feel 

trapped like Sybil in her jar. Yeah, that was a T.S. Eliot 
reference. I’m capable of more than just kids’ movies 
and Nickelodeon references. Where’s my upper-level 
writing requirement fulfillment?

I pack up my stuff and head back to the South Quad 

Residence Hall basement, the same place my friends 
spent every Thursday night and Friday morning last 
year. Life gets a kick out of irony.

With my life wasting away, I decide to roll the dice 

and start breaking away at this paper. Hopefully, it’ll 
be better than the exam.

*Three hours later*
I think I’m delusional. I’m drying up.
Water Me — Lizzo
If you’re reading this, if you’ve made it this far, send 

help. I’m only 600 words into a 1,400-word essay and 
I don’t know if I’ll make it.

Reflecting on the events that led me to this moment 

isn’t pleasant, but the only way we grow is through 
learning from our mistakes. Honestly, I’d rather learn 
enough to ace this exam and finish this paper instead, 
but I guess this’ll do.

I can’t believe I thought this would be a blessing. 

Two big grades the same day? Let’s get them out of 
the way! Nothing could go wrong. After I’m done, 
it’s all downhill until the end of the semester. Too 

bad I might never make it up the 
hill to begin with.

One-hundred words in my essay 

later, I check my watch again. Oh 
no.

4:44 — JAY-Z
How the hell is it almost 5 

in the morning? I haven’t done 
anything. This night has been the 
educational equivalent of going 
trick-or-treating and only getting 
toothbrushes and Dots.

I’m writing this essay but I’m 

not even sure what the English 
language is at this point. The lines 
blur together. I hope this bad boy 
is even slightly coherent. This is 
the biggest RIP. Time slows and 
speeds by simultaneously. What is 
life?

____45_____ — Bon Iver
*Three more hours later*
You know that episode of 

“SpongeBob” when Mr. Krabs is 
calling the radio station asking for 

the song that goes “Beep beep boop bebop boop bop?” 
That’s basically my inner monologue at this point. Nine 
a.m. is not a good look on this young lad. Still wearing 
the same outfit as yesterday, I have made a Matt 
Harmon-shaped dent in this couch I’ve been sitting on.

I’ve watched the dining hall open for the unfortunate 

souls with 8 a.m. classes. Well-rested students fresh 
out of the shower get ready to face the day with an 
enthusiasm unknown to mankind while I fade into 
oblivion.

The same friends in my position last year are no 

longer on the honors math track, which means they get 
eight hours of wonderful sleep now. I see them walk 
down the stairs from the South Quad lobby to greet me. 
I knew this day would come.

“How’re you feelin’, Matt?” they ask. I guess this 

is what I deserve. I just didn’t think it would sting as 
much.

They head off to their 9 o’clocks as I stay right where 

I was. I hope they visit in an hour.

Call Me on Your Way Back Home — Ryan Adams
Four hours until my exam, my paper is done. It may 

have been written with my blood, sweat and tears, but 
it’s done. I don’t think it was actually Hemingway who 
said, “Write drunk, edit sober,” but last night, I was not 
drunk and I will definitely not be editing this paper 
at all so looks as if I failed Ernest or whoever he 
stole the mantra from.

I walk into class, ready to turn in my paper and do 

some last-minute cramming for my exam in a few 
hours. My eyes are dead, the fire inside has burned 
out. I ask my friend in lecture when we’re turning 
in the paper. What she said proved someone is out 
to get me. By someone, I mean myself because as I 
said before, I have no one else to blame but yours 
truly.

“The paper? You mean the one that’s due next 

week?” she said.

An International Village in Ypsilanti?

The fight over gentrification in a rust belt city

by Brian Kuang & Ishi Mori, Deputy Statement Editor and Daily Staff Reporter
A

t a May meeting of the Ypsi-
lanti City Council, Amy Xue 
Foster — a Chinese-born, 
Troy-based businesswoman 
— proposed an ambitious 

project to construct a glittering high-end 
apartment complex on a patch of dilapidated 
industrial land. To be dubbed “International 
Village,” the complex would sport distinctly 
East-Asian architectural decor and target 
well-to-do Asian nationals attending Eastern 
Michigan University and the University of 
Michigan or working in automotive research.

The project was to bring at least $250 mil-

lion in investment — primarily raised through 
the controversial EB-5 visa, which grants 
green cards to wealthy foreign investors — to 
a city that had seen better days before most 
of its manufacturing jobs left, promising to 
revitalize a dilapidated 36-acre patch of land 
that was costing the city over a million dollars 
in debt per year. The “village” would contain 
high-end housing units and self-contained 
commercial spaces to serve tenants. To some 

city officials and residents — like resident Bob 
Resch — the proposal was akin to serving the 
city money on a plate.

“The property there has languished for the 

past 20 years, and this development seemed to 
be the first ray of hope that something would 
become of the 38 acres,” Resch said. “You’ve 
got to believe that anybody who’s willing to 
dump $250 to $300 million to the infrastruc-
ture … they have to be serious.”

Yet not all see the project through the same 

lens. Numerous residents — particularly those 
in the adjacent, predominantly working-class 
neighborhoods — balked at the prospect of 
creating a self-contained block that could 
increase their rents and provide them with 
little tangible benefit in return.

Public trust in the development process — 

already tenuous as opponents feel there has 
been insufficient public input — collapsed 
when allegations emerged in late Septem-
ber that city officials took a weeklong trip to 
China that was allegedly funded by a compa-
ny represented by Xue Foster — a clear con-

flict of interest. Less than five months after 
the project was initially proposed, the four 
officials found themselves sitting in the same 
City Council chambers facing an investigation 
initiated by the City Attorney.

In many ways, the disagreement that 

evolved over International Village in Ypsi-
lanti echoes those over gentrification taking 
place in cities from San Francisco to Detroit. 
All of these stories carry common threads: 
new residential developments are proposed to 
serve growing housing demand from higher-
income workers moving into the local econ-
omy, raising economic and social anxieties 
among pre-existing residents.

Washtenaw County itself is no stranger to 

such public polarization over gentrification. 
In Ann Arbor city politics — where Democrats 
hold all but one local office — the fault lines 
lie not along party identification, but rather 
where one stands on the issue of building lux-
ury high-rises downtown. Yet the debate over 
International Village in Ypsilanti is unique 
and carries major implications for the future 

of the post-industrial rust belt town.

*****
As originally proposed to the city, Interna-

tional Village was to contain 1,750 units, each 
listed at least $1,100 per month. The complex 
would also contain commercial units target-
ing its residents. The presentation explicitly 
notes the proximity of the proposed site to 
Eastern Michigan University, the University 
of Michigan and several high-tech research 
hubs such as the American Center for Mobil-
ity in Ypsilanti and Mcity in Ann Arbor.

But placing a luxury housing complex and 

3,000 wealthy foreign nationals in a city with 
a population of 21,000 did not sit well with 
some residents concerned with the potential 
displacement of working-class residents. Par-
ticularly troubling to some were concerns that 
the “village” would displace its predominant-
ly African-American neighbors.

Longtime Ypsilanti resident Bryan Foley, 

who lives near the proposed project, said the 
International Village was introduced with 
little consideration for the needs or history of 
the surrounding community, adding that he 
would prefer a business that would add jobs 
to the local economy to take the place of the 
proposed high-rise.

“We had an automotive plant … that closed 

in the late ’80s or ’90s, and just outside of the 
township you had a General Motors plant and 
a Bosch plant. All those closed,” Foley said. 
“Immediately after those businesses clos-
ing, we had an epidemic of crack cocaine, 
and we’re just now getting stabilized. So now 
you’ve got an influx of new people coming in 
and rents will go up … basically we’re getting 
displaced again, in our own communities.”

Amber Fellows, a local activist and member 

of Ypsilanti’s Human Relations Commission, 
argued the development adds insult to injury 
to the African-American community, which 
is facing pressure from socio-economic forces 
outside of their control.

“This development is fundamentally not 

serving African-American communities, and 
it would actually likely put pressures on that 
community, which is already being turned 
over,” Fellows said. 

Ypsilanti City Councilmember Brian Robb, 

D-Ward 3, argued there is little empirical evi-
dence that International Village will contrib-
ute to or speed up gentrification, though he 
conceded gentrification is a real phenomenon 
in Ypsilanti.

“They’ve never actually been able to 

explain why this would drive African Ameri-
cans out of South Side and the whole concept 
is: If you own your home, this development’s 

not going to impact you,” Robb said. “I think 
it’s a leap to say that this would gentrify people 
out of the community.”

What underlied all these concerns was an 

anxiety that the residents of the International 
Village — predominantly international stu-
dents from Asia — would be largely self-con-
tained in an insular community. At a coffee 
shop meeting of community activists opposed 
to International Village, a sign with pseudo-
Chinese writing hung on the wall calling the 
EB-5 visa “Donald Trump’s vision for immi-
gration.”

However, 
community 
members 
like 

Nathanael Romero denied any suggestion of a 
soft xenophobia toward Asians as a driver of 
their opposition.

“There was a sense that if you were against 

International Village, you were against inter-
national students, against Chinese people, 
against the sort of diversity that would come 
from that,” Romero said. “A lot of the oppo-
sition that we’re seeing to International Vil-
lage is coming from millennial renters and 
the Black community on the South side, and 
some of the conversation was: ‘Is there anti-
Asian sentiment in the Black community?’ 
‘Is there anti-Black sentiment in the Asian-
American community?’ ”

Foley was more blunt in his assessment.
“I wouldn’t care if they’re from Nigeria or 

Toledo, Ohio or whatever,” Foley said. “But 
you’re purposely bringing a group of people 
and isolating them — and this land is going to 
be exclusively for their benefit, and exclude 
the rest of the community.”

*****
Those opposed to the development plan 

were further frustrated by a lack of trans-
parency in Ypsilanti City Council, which 
held only two community meetings this past 
summer to discuss the matter — one the day 
before the body approved the sale of the 
property.

Adding a further layer of mistrust to the 

project were the allegations that a trip to 
China taken by city officials was improperly 
funded by the developer.

According to emails released to the public 

as part of an investigation by the Ypsilanti 
City Attorney’s office, City Attorney John 
Barr explicitly warned city officials in May 
that it would be an ethical violation to accept 
any trips to China paid for by the developer.

“A trip to China would be worth thou-

sands of dollars and cannot in any way be 
considered minimal,” Barr wrote in the May 
memo. “Even though a China trip would be 
educational, the benefit conferred, consider-
ing that the developer is requesting action by 
the city, would, in my opinion, make accept-
ing the trip unethical and illegal under the 
city ordinance.”

Yet in late September, Mayor Amanda 

Edmonds, Mayor Pro-Tem Nicole Brown, 
Police Chief Tony DeGiusti and City Man-
ager Darwin McClary took a trip to China, 
ostensibly to meet potential investors. 
Released emails showed the officials sought 
alternative funding for the trip, and received 
a “scholarship” offer from the Wayne State 
University Chinese Students and Scholars 
association to fund the trip for the purpose 
of promoting “cultural exchanges between 
China and the United States.”

However, an investigation by the Detroit 

Metro Times and a subsequent probe by the 
Ypsilanti City Attorney found evidence the 
city officials were aware their $16,800 grant 
had been indirectly funded by Xue Foster’s 
development company — a clear conflict of 
interest.

All four accused city officials have claimed 

to be unaware of the source of funding for 
their trip, and the matter is currently under 
investigation by a special counsel appoint-
ed by the City Attorney. In an email to The 
Daily, Xue Foster declined to discuss the alle-
gations of impropriety. Edmonds and Brown 
did not respond to requests for comment for 

this story. DeGiusti redirected all inquiries to 
the Department of Economic Development.

Even supporters of the International Vil-

lage development acknowledged that public 
trust in the issue had been compromised, 
making the future approval of the project 
unclear.

“It’s almost laughable — it’s a little frus-

trating that you’re looking at this kind of a 
development and your guys can’t even get 
out of the huddle without fumbling and bum-
bling,” Resch said. “I’m glad that they’ve 
decided to do this internal investigation with 
this outside law firm. … I think personally it’s 
a jumble of miscommunications.”

For those like Foley, who already held a 

dim view of their city’s handling of the Inter-
national Village project, the scandal only 
serves to validate their impression that some 
city officials aren’t acting with their constit-
uents’ best interests in mind.

“I really do believe (city officials) acted out 

of bad faith,” Foley said. “I really do believe 
that they thought this was just going to be 
business as usual, and nobody was going to 
do checks and balances on them and they 
were going to just squeeze it on through.”

*****
The uncertain fate of International Vil-

lage and developments like it illustrate the 
dilemma facing Ypsilanti in the 21st century. 
Founded in 1825 by three settlers on a cross-
ing the Huron River and named after a gen-
eral from the Greek War of Independence, 
Ypsilanti grew from the automotive industry.

Like too many factory towns in the Indus-

trial Midwest, however, Ypsilanti’s fortunes 
soured with the departure of many of these 
factory jobs.

Since 2001, 13,000 manufacturing jobs 

have left the city, with the Willow Run plant 
— a famous bomber factory in World War II 
— shuttered by General Motors in 2009.

Ypsilanti’s population has hollowed out 

by roughly one-third from its peak at almost 
30,000 in the 1970s. The 2008 financial cri-
sis hit the city disproportionately hard, and 
average incomes continue to lag behind the 

national average. Following the recession, 
though, the population has grown alongside 
a revitalized Depot Town-centered down-
town. 

The knowledge-based economy, rooted 

in the presence of the University of Michi-
gan and Eastern Michigan University and 
their affiliated research complexes, offers 
to breathe new life into the city. However, 
as new, more affluent residents have pushed 
into Ypsilanti, a dilemma is increasingly 
evident in the community. How can a com-
munity grow itself economically, while still 
protecting the interests of its longtime resi-
dents?

“What we’re seeing is a process of tech 

gentrification and it’s going to change the 
character of Ypsilanti and Ypsilanti Town-
ship,” Romero said. “The question of inter-
national capital is an important one, because 
the number one concern is our community 
stakeholders having a seat at the table, par-
ticularly the most vulnerable ones — and it 
doesn’t seem like it.”

According to Robb, Ypsilanti must find 

a new source of vitality as manufacturing 
declines throughout the Midwest and the 
rest of the United States, though he main-
tained the city did not specifically court the 
technology sector.

“Manufacturing in Michigan is disappear-

ing, so the logical move is into service and 
technology type of businesses,” Robb said. 
“(However) if you draw parallels between 
this and we’re moving toward a technology-
based community, I think that’s coinciden-
tal.”

The development itself is now in jeop-

ardy in light of the allegations of impropri-
ety. On Monday, Ypsilanti City Council put 
the International Village development on 
hold, after Xue Foster’s qualifications as a 
developer were called into question and the 
architectural and construction management 
firms exited the project. McClary wrote in an 
email that if no development agreement is in 
place by Dec. 31, the purchase agreement will 
likely expire and kill the project.

From Skaramagas Dock
F

rom the center of Greece’s largest 
refugee camp, you’re surrounded 
by hundreds of temporary housing 
units. The white, rectangular metal 

boxes are in precise rows, creating a grid that 
projects a sense of order. Many of the boxes 
are adorned with rooftop solar water heaters 
and television dishes. The United Nations, Save 
the Children and other international donor 
logos abound. Here, Syrian families wait for 
resettlement in northern Europe. 

By noon the center of the camp at Skaramagas 

Dock, on the outskirts of Athens, is lively. 
Young children chase one another around the 
boxes. Teenagers kick a soccer ball. Parents 
bring children to the library, or to the Red 
Cross Red Crescent health clinic. Volunteers 
— Europeans — traverse the cement-covered, 
unshaded center in colored vests that identify 
their organizations.

As you progress through the camp, you catch 

glimpses of a radiant blue sea to your right — the 
Mediterranean. Hidden behind rows of white 
housing units, it’s striking.

The view to your left, above the rows of one-

story camp dwellings, leaves an even greater 
impression: hundreds, perhaps thousands, of 
steel shipping containers stacked six or seven 
containers high, waiting to be loaded onto 
vessels bound for ports across the globe. 
They’re labeled with the names of South 
Korean, Chinese, German and Greek shipping 
companies.

--
I visited the refugee camp in March, 

alongside other graduate students from the 
University of Michigan. We saw the boxes, the 
sea and the shipping containers through the 
windows of our van as we were arriving. While 
those sights weren’t immediately distressing, or 
emotionally taxing, a brief encounter minutes 
later altered my perception of what I saw that 
morning, and of Europe’s refugee crisis.

With my back turned to our guide, I stood in 

front of a young girl, likely no older than four. 
She was alone, staring at me — an outsider. 
I stared at her. Moments before, I’d seen her 
chasing friends around a nearby box.

She was dressed and acted like many young 

children across the world. And yet I couldn’t 
avoid thinking that she might be different. I 
asked myself: How would being displaced affect 
her? How would her life be different than those 
of Greek children in nearby neighborhoods? I 
wanted more questions answered, too. Where 
and when would her family move? Would she 
ever return to Syria?

I knew almost nothing about her, but in the 

moments she happily chased her friends, and 
stared at me, I saw glimpses of her life. I also 
began to feel my own inadequacy.

It doesn’t matter that Skaramagas Dock 

is orderly and well-run. (I’d been told before 
visiting that, because of this, officials typically 
take visitors there and not to more deprived 
sites.) It doesn’t matter that volunteers ensure 
it is clean and safe. It doesn’t matter that living 
conditions seem to be improving, with a new 
library and sewing workshop.

Placing people in boxes in camps, for months 

if not years, is a tragedy. We box up goods — 
olives, olive oil and feta cheese from Greece — 
in shipping containers and send them around 
the world. We’ve sheltered tens of thousands of 
refugees in similar boxes (and much worse, in 
tents during winter storms), leaving them thus 
incapacitated for months, or more typically, 
years.

This contrast, and the consequences, is 

clear. One makes people richer; the other leaves 
refugees— including children like the girl I saw 
— stuck in time, in between places.

--
Earlier in the week I’d heard from prominent 

NGOs, politicians and researchers about how 
politics in the United States and Europe have 
failed. Skaramagas Dock is certainly evidence 
of that.

I’d heard how our foreign policy has failed to 

address the conflicts in the “origin countries” — 
Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria — that have forced 
millions up against, and through, Europe’s 
deadly borders and seas. I’d read, and now seen 
at Skaramagas Dock, how thousands have been 
left waiting in camps and “jungles,” amid the 
shadows of Europe’s “receiving countries.”

Experts from the United Nations High 

Commissioner for Refugees, politicians and 
foreign policy advisers convincingly argued 
how outdated regulations, austerity and 
nationalistic voters in receiving countries have 
extended the crisis and impoverished our 
world. These conversations led me to think 
that my government’s policy response has 
failed, contributing to my sense of inadequacy. 
The refugees affected by politics and policy 
in Europe, and by the immigration ban I’d 
protested at the airport only weeks before, now 
had images and names in my mind.

Seeing the similarity between the shipping 

containers and refugee shelters, and knowing 
how differently we treat their contents, made 
me question our economic practices and public 
policy as well.

Shipping containers are one of the most 

visible symbols of our global economy today. 

Seeing them next to Skaramagas Dock 
suggested the crisis has had little impact on our 
economic world order or individual economic 
decisions. The containers should have been 
comforting evidence that Greece was finally 
recovering from a decade-long, severe economic 
depression. Instead, the sight of cranes 
shuffling containers around the port, and onto 
ships, imparted a disconcerting impression of 

normalcy — that the refugee crisis had had little 
impact on economic and business decisions.

It’s human nature that when something 

bad happens to others, you stop what you’re 
doing and help. It’s in law, too; when a ship is 
in distress, neighboring sailors must come to 
the rescue. Economists and businesses seem 
to behave differently. There are more refugees 
today than any time since the 1940s, but 
businesses haven’t altered what they’re doing, 
even when those in need are just next door.

I felt inadequate because I study economics 

and public policy, two disciplines that clearly 
haven’t done enough to solve the crisis to 
get refugees out of the camp at Skaramagas 
Dock. Economists and policy analysts have 
failed to persuade the public of the benefits 
of immigration and of welcoming refugees. 
Perhaps more damning is that both disciplines 
have contributed to the business-as-usual 
attitudes seen next door to the camp. Economists 
and policy makers may have tempered their 
enthusiasm for neoliberalism since the years 
of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, or 
even Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, but ideas like 
societies as markets and individuals as profit-
maximizers still affect how we act and justify 
narrow-minded decisions.

I haven’t abandoned my belief in economics 

as a systematic approach that can lead 
individuals, and ultimately societies, to the best 
outcomes. Why? Economics tells us to make 
decisions using a set of rules — by thinking 
on the margin, by considering “opportunity 
costs” (the next best alternative to a choice) and 
by weighing costs against benefits. Together 
these rules explain how we (should) respond to 
incentives, whether social, legal or financial. But 

in the absence of public policy, using this recipe 
to dictate your behavior, without thinking 
seriously about how others are affected, can 
lead us all to undesirable outcomes. Isn’t it crazy 
to make decisions in a narrow-minded, cost-
benefit calculating way when your neighbors 
are refugees (as in Greece), or living on $2 a day 
(as in much of the United States)? And yet many 
people and businesses regularly do this.

--
Our response to the crisis could be different. 

Before visiting the camp that morning, we met 
with Nadina Christopoulou of the Melissa 
Network.

The Melissa Network is a community 

organization 
led 
by 
immigrant 
women, 

including former refugees, for migrant women. 
From the first two floors of an apartment 
building in Athens’s Victoria Square, the 
Melissa Network provides classes, counseling 
and community for women in need. Artists and 
activists stop by each day. Several MacArthur 
fellows, including A.E. Stallings and Michigan’s 
Khaled Mattawa, have read and taught poetry 
there.

I left deeply impressed that morning. 

The 
community 
exudes 
generosity 
and 

empowerment. When introducing a teacher 
there, Christopoulou made sure we heard 
the teacher’s story: she was born in a refugee 
camp. And now as a young woman, that she 
has created and taught a hundred lessons to 
younger, newer refugees. The introduction 
was a small act, yet was visibly empowering; 
the young teacher spoke confidently to us. 
The Melissa Network is growing a diaspora of 
empowered refugees — throughout Athens, 
and as they are resettled, Europe. Many of them 
were once not much different than the girl I 
stood in front of at Skaramagas Dock.

Throughout the week in Athens, I had heard 

repeatedly that we must address the root causes 
of the crisis — the conditions and conflict in 
the origin countries. One foreign diplomat 
described “deep pools of suffering” in Syria, 
Iraq and Afghanistan. While this is certainly 
true, doing so may take decades.

In a lecture to the Ford School of Public Policy 

last month, Christopoulou proffered a different 
solution, one that can have an immediate 
impact, in the United States and Europe. 
We should work to build more integrated 
communities, connected by what we have 
in common and supported by small, healing 
gestures. Melissa’s approach is a noneconomic 
solution in a policy environment defined 
by economic ideas like austerity, efficient 
public management and entrepreneurial 
philanthropy. Instead of weighing the costs 
and benefits of serving those who have just 
joined their community, the Melissa Network 
welcomes them. And it’s clear that her 
approach is working — empowering young 
migrants, eradicating extremism and bringing 
the Athens community together. 

Visiting Athens in March led me to see the 

ways our government, and my disciplines, 
have failed. The Melissa Network shows what 
is possible.

Personal Statement: My anxiety

W

hen I was 14, it felt as if 
someone suddenly hung 
a strobe light over me. 
It refused to budge and 

followed me everywhere, the light pierc-
ing. I felt I was constantly glanced at, 
scrutinized and judged by everyone. I was 
wrong, but I didn’t know it back then.

All I knew was that words hung like 

icicles from the roof of my mouth, and 
my throat was parched when a stranger 
talked to me. Ideas surfaced like bubbles 
inside my head, but failed to roll off my 
sandpapery tongue. My stomach churned, 
my hands trembled and sweated. My 
heart raced when I was assigned to speak 
in front of a crowd. It panged for acknowl-
edgment and admiration. I let it down 
miserably again and again. I could hardly 
say anything. The few words that came 
out were shaky, squeaky and rushed. I 
spent nights dissecting the moments — 
chalking them as failures — and crying 
immeasurably with shame. I never spoke 
about it to anyone.

I turned 17, and entered 11th grade. 

Things hardly changed. I enveloped 
myself with the three closest friends I had 
growing up, using them fiercely as a shield 
so I didn’t have to talk to anyone else. I 
was my geekiest, unreserved and sarcas-
tic self with them. I talked for hours and 
they realized how passionate and hilari-
ous I could be. One of my friends also 
had a penchant for tough love. She asked 
me why I didn’t talk more and why I was 
always quiet around others. I hated her 
questions, found them intrusive and tried 
to disregard them.

I went to college alone — my friends 

remained oceans away — and was pres-
ently overwhelmed. The hallways and 
classrooms 
teetered 
with 
overeager 

and over-competitive people. Everyone 
seemed to have their lives under control 
despite entering college a few days ago. 
I tried to reach out to only those who 
seemed harmless to me, skipping out on 
many potential friendships.

I worried for months when a conver-

sation with a classmate I’d barely known 
stumbled to a resounding awkward 
silence. I regretted flaking out on invita-

tions because I’d felt too nervous to say 
anything. I thought I was always blun-
dering; I felt nobody else did. I fumbled 
in lectures and giving presentations, and 
felt I couldn’t show my face to anyone 
after them. I felt insecure, misunderstood 
and incessantly observed, and considered 
as an object of ridicule and scorn.

I was wrong, but I could not stop myself. 

My anxiety led to my shame, which spi-
raled into a deep depression. I hid in my 
cramped dorm room, and mechanically 
chewed the food I’d gotten from a cheap, 
greasy place because I couldn’t go to the 
dining hall and have everyone I know see 
me as a loser, a loner or an antisocial freak 
when I did not consider myself to be one. 
I loved being around people, I loved my 

family and my friends, and I wanted to 
get to know others. But I was convinced 
that everyone I met hated me, pitied me 
and would drop me the minute they found 
someone better. I harbored and cultivated 
so much self-hate that I believed nothing 
would ever change — I would always be 
alone and inadequate in everything I did. 

It took some time to even start the baby 

steps of acknowledging my long-term 
problems. I talked to my parents first, 
nervous about their reactions. My father 
— one of the strongest people I know — 
shared that he struggled with anxiety 
when he was my age. He also stuttered 
occasionally, but he gradually overcame 
it to have an exceptional career in pub-
lic speaking. My mother lifted the pres-

sure by saying it didn’t matter if I failed at 
everything I did. I laughed, knowing she 
wasn’t serious, but felt thankful for the 
immense love and support she showed. A 
therapist I went to for a while told me to 
be proud of what I’d accomplished. I told 
her all my accomplishments were small; 
she sternly and consistently reminded 
me to always look at the glass as half-full, 
and that I was wrong. I also expressed 
my problems to two friends. Both turned 
out to be very supportive, listening to 
every worry I had, no matter how silly or 
inane it was, with the greatest empathy 
and attention. I was touched and grate-
ful by everyone I reached out to, unable to 
believe that it was OK to share and that I 
could stop putting on a façade.

I don’t always feel great, though. There 

are days when I am pounded with bitter-
ness, regret and anger that I suffer from 
anxiety. There are days when I must take 
extra steps to take care of myself. There 
are days when I worry, over-worry and 
fall asleep at 8 p.m. because I can’t take 
it anymore. I am easily tired, saddened 
and hurt. But I am also trying to get bet-
ter every day. I try to strike up conversa-
tions with strangers. I don’t wait for other 
people to reach out to me. I go to places 
alone and enjoy myself. I people-watch, 
rhyme words and create stories about 
them. I embarrass myself in front of peo-
ple, including some professors, and stop 
caring too much.

I also see a lot of people like me in 

places everywhere. I work in a residence 
hall and can quickly pick out the shiest 
or most socially anxious residents, unlike 
some of my colleagues on staff. I try to 
accommodate them and make sure they 
are comfortable and happy. I reach out to 
them because I have been in their shoes 
and sometimes still am these days.

My anxiety — my biggest shame — has 

invaluably taught me to become more 
observing and empathetic toward people. 
I am less inclined to judge anyone. I am 
imperfect, mosaic and broken. But I am 
also considerate, aware and strong. I am 
finally on the road to showing myself to 
the world — unworried, in the moment 
and unapologetically real.
