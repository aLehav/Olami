SARAH KUNKEL/Daily
American Culture and Native American Studies Prof. Bethany Hughes discusses the history of redface and how it has affected our cultural climate at the Politics of Blackface Talk in North Quad Monday. 

In light of the recent controversy 

surrounding Virginia Gov. Ralph 

Northam’s 
1984 
medical 
school 

yearbook, 
in 
which 
he 
and 
a 

classmate posed in blackface and 

donned a Ku Klux Klan robe, the 

University of Michigan Institute 

for the Humanities hosted the panel 

discussion titled “The Politics of 

Blackface Then and Now: What’s in 

Your Yearbook?” Monday afternoon 

in North Quad Residence Hall.

The event drew a crowd of more 

than 50, though only a handful of 

students attended. The event was 

part of the High Stakes Culture 

series hosted by the Institute for the 

Humanities and U-M Humanities 

Collaboratory, 
which 
brings 

humanities 
professors 
together 

for a conversation about relevant 

political issues and current events. 

Monday’s 
conversation 
was 

moderated 
by 
Angela 
Dillard, 

associate dean for undergraduate 

education, focused primarily on 

the 
ramifications 
of 
blackface 

and the prevalence of minstrelsy 

throughout 
the 
19th 
and 
20th 

centuries. In the early 19th century, 

minstrel 
shows 
featuring 
white 

actors performing dances in black 

makeup gained popularity. 

Panelists also discussed redface, 

or the commercialization of Native 

American identity, and yellowface, 

the appropriation of Asian cultures. 

Dillard said these conversations 

about blackface reveal how common 

expressions of overt racism are in 

modern American society.

“For weeks on end, what was 

lurking in yearbooks became a 

national obsession,” Dillard said. 

“One that reminds us of issues 

around 
blackface, 
race, 
racism 

and 
various 
forms 
of 
cultural 

appropriation are still alive and 

very present in our contemporary 

landscape.”

Many 
panelists 
noted 
the 

tendency to dismiss incidents of 

blackface, redface and yellowface 

as isolated episodes that ignore 

the 
history 
behind 
cultural 

appropriation. 

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

President’s Commission on Carbon 

Neutrality hosted its first town 

hall 
Monday 
night 
to 
discuss 

the goals and responsibilities of 

the commission and to share the 

collective 
ideas 
of 
community 

members with the commission. The 

commission has scheduled another 

town hall for April 3.

The event, which was open to all 

students, faculty and community 

members, was at capacity and had a 

waitlist of approximately 90 people. 

Despite the initial interest in the 

forum, the auditorium had about 60 

open seats during the actual event.

The 
town 
hall 
featured 

presentations 
from 
co-chairs 

of 
the 
commission 
Jennifer 

Haverkamp, director of the Graham 

Sustainability Institute, and Stephen 

Forrest, 
professor 
of 
electrical 

engineering and computer science, 

as well as an audience Q&A.

In an earlier interview with The 

Daily, University President Mark 

Schlissel said he hoped the town hall 

would provide an opportunity for 

the commission to listen to concerns 

from Ann Arbor residents and allow 

community 
members 
community 

members to be more sympathetic 

toward the efforts of the University 

in moving toward carbon neutrality.

“I’d love to understand which 

questions are front of mind for 

students,” Schlissel said. “In the 

flipside, I’d love the students to see 

the thoughtfulness and seriousness 

with which the members of the 

commission are taking this really 

important task.”

Haverkamp began the event by 

discussing the University’s history 

of sustainability and its goal to 

reduce its carbon emissions by 25 

percent by 2025. She noted, initially, 

carbon emissions went down by 

approximately 20 percent, but after 

the University expanded, emissions 

are currently only down 7.5 percent. 

“It led to 2025 sustainability goals, 

which Michigan is still operating 

under 
and 
working 
toward,” 

Haverkamp 
said. 
“And 
these 

were goals on landfill waste, food 

purchases, land-based chemicals, 

transportation efficiency, campus 

culture and, the reason we are 

here today, greenhouse gases. And 

the greenhouse gas goal that was 

established through that process is 

to, by 2025, reduce scope 1 and scope 

2 emissions by 25 percent below the 

levels that we had in 2006.”

The 
GHG 
Protocol 
Corporate 

Standard classifies scope 1 emissions 

as direct emissions from owned 

or controlled sources and scope 2 

emissions as indirect emissions from 

the generation of purchased energy. 

Forrest added the commission 

aims to move past these goals. He 

said 
the 
commission 
welcomes 

community input. However, Forrest 

said he wants people to know the 

commission has no actual power to 

take action.

Bob Dascola and his family have 

been in the barbershop business for 

220 years. The family barbershop, 

Dascola Barbers, will celebrate its 80th 

anniversary in April. Dascola Barbers is 

located near Ben & Jerry’s and Potbelly 

Sandwich Shop at 304 1/2 S. State St. 

Dascola emphasized the importance 

of family in his business practice. 

“This is a family business that we 

have,” Dascola said. “It’s not just one 

person. It’s a whole family, and so this is 

what we’re celebrating in April. Eighty 

years of a family business in Ann Arbor.”

The shop at South State isn’t the 

only location the family has owned. 

There have been a total of five different 

locations, including the current one. 

The first shop was opened by Dascola’s 

father in 1939.

Dascola began his career in 1965 after 

he graduated from Detroit Greene’s 

Barber College. Dascola said he worked 

in his father’s barbershop throughout 

his education. 

“I can tell you growing up in the 

business really made a big difference 

in how I viewed things,” Dascola said. 

“One of the things that we’ve always 

prided ourselves on was having a family 

member in each one of our businesses to 

make sure that the people working there 

were doing good work, because when 

your name’s on the front of the building, 

that is your reputation out there.”

Dascola said the world of hair has 

changed since he first started in the 

business. 

He said his own hairstyle helped him 

get on the map and gain popularity.

“People would walk by and say, ‘Well, 

look, there’s a guy with a long hair cut. 

He must know what he’s doing,’ which 

sure put me on the map and I actually 

put two places out of business on South 

U because those guys didn’t have a clue

‘U’ Commission hosts town hall on carbon neutrality 

Each month, The Michigan Daily 

sits down with University President 

Mark Schlissel to discuss events and 

issues on campus. During this month’s 

interview, 
Schlissel 
touched 
on 

topics of One University, the Carbon 

Neutrality Commission, the felony 

disclosure policy, free speech and 

ethical food practices.

One University

The One University Campaign 

was created as an effort to equip 

the University of Michigan’s Flint 

and Dearborn campuses with more 

resources. Schlissel said while all three 

University campuses share the same 

overarching goals, they are separate 

campuses 
under 
one 
university 

umbrella.

“We have distinct missions and 

distinct priorities, and we employ and 

serve distinct communities of people,” 

Schlissel said. “We’re very much a 

confederation of three campuses.”

Members of the 1U campaign have 

said all three campuses operate under 

one president and one board of regents. 

Representatives from the campaign — 

which is run by a coalition of students 

and faculty across the three campus 

— spoke at the most recent University 

Board of Regents meeting and has 

garnered the support of the Lecturer 

Employees’ Organization.

Specifically, 1U is asking the 

University and state of Michigan 

to dictate more funding to the U-M 

Dearborn and Flint campuses and 

claims the University inhibits these 

campuses through the use of a “silo 

system” budget model created by 

University administration.

Schlissel said the autonomy of 

each campus allows the campuses 

to serve their individual student 

populations. He noted differences in 

the socioeconomic and geographic 

diversity among the three campuses 

as some factors that would create 

different student populations and 

ultimately different uses of funding.

“Each campus has the flexibility 

to serve its student community by 

making its own choices and priorities 

and policies,” Schlissel said. “Each 

of the campuses makes up its own 

budget based on how to best serve 

its constituency.”

With free student tickets for 

the Ben Shapiro event on Tuesday 

evening selling out in under two 

minutes on Feb. 18, some students are 

now selling their reserved seats for as 

much as $200. 

The event, which is hosted by the 

University of Michigan’s chapter of 

Young Americans for Freedom, had 

initially held 617 of the 1060 tickets for 

University students. 

 YAF Vice Chair Kate Westa, LSA 

sophomore, explained while YAF 

does not support ticket reselling — 

especially at such an expensive price 

— the organization does not have 

control of what happens to tickets 

once they are in students’ possession.

“YAF does a really good job of 

bringing these high profile speakers at 

such a low cost to us and we want to 

ensure that it goes for no money to the 

people who end up securing tickets for 

the event,” Westa said. “We don’t

condone the reselling, especially at 

such high prices, but once we get rid 

of those tickets, it’s out of our hands. 

It’s unfortunate to see this happen 

because we want everyone to be 

able to go, but that’s just the way the 

market works sometimes.”

LSA junior Sohum Mehta wanted 

to see Shapiro, but was unable to get 

one of the free tickets.

“I’m still looking, but people are 

charging like $150 for a ticket,” Mehta 

said. 

Numerous students are selling the 

tickets on University Facebook pages. 

Though students like Mehta were 

having trouble finding moderately 

priced 
tickets, 
LSA 
senior 
Ben 

Rappaport was able to buy one for $40. 

Rappaport wanted to attend the event 

to learn more about Shapiro’s beliefs, 

which are different from his own.

“From what I heard I got it for a 

steal,” Rappaport wrote in a message 

to The Daily. “I think it’ll be good for 

me to hear the views of someone whom 

I disagree with almost everything on.”

LSA junior Amar Srinivasan was 

one of the students selling his ticket 

to see Shapiro on the “University 

of Michigan Class of 2020” page on 

Facebook. He sold his ticket for $45, 

but reported that he saw a range of 

prices from $20 to $60.

The University of Michigan’s Senate 

Advisory Committee on University 

Affairs met Monday at the Fleming 

Administration Building to discuss 

including 
faculty 
governance 
in 

University decisions and management of 

University finances.

SACUA chair Neil Marsh, professor 

of chemistry, began the meeting by 

calling for an approval of the day’s 

agenda as well as the agenda for the 

Senate Assembly meeting on March 18. 

While sharing general announcements, 

Marsh detailed the meeting that took 

place over spring break between himself; 

SACUA Vice Chair Joy Beatty, associate 

professor of management studies; and 

University President Mark Schlissel.

“We conveyed (SACUA’s) concerns 

over the non-participation of faculty 

governance,” Marsh said. “He was 

receptive to that and said that he would 

communicate with his executive officers 

to emphasize the fact that SACUA 

faculty government should be consulted 

more often.”

The 
committee 
subsequently 

considered how to modify a survey to be 

presented to student and faculty. Keith 

Riles, professor of physics and chair of 

the Senate Assembly’s Administration 

Evaluation Committee came to the 

meeting to head the discussion of how to 

best design the survey. Riles mentioned 

how the survey would help monitor 

faculty perception of administrative 

functions within the University Library, 

the Division of Public Safety and Security 

and Canvas among other components. 

Some questions centered on changes in 

the University’s Standard Practice Guide 

dictating policy, but several others asked 

about Senate Assembly resolutions that 

had already passed, which previous 

surveys usually did not ask about.

SACUA member Michael Atzmon, 

professor of nuclear engineering and 

radiological sciences, suggested the 

survey should ask about SPG revisions 

relating to faculty-student relationships. 

The new guidelines ban relationships 

between students and faculty. Several 

members of SACUA expressed concern 

regarding the new policy. 

Concerns 
come 
from 
SMTD 

professor David Daniels arrest earlier 

this year on charges of sexual assault 

and accusations from a SMTD graduate 

student for drugging and assaulting him. 

Beatty described a meeting she had 

with Sally Churchill, vice president and 

secretary of the University, about the 

urgency of the survey.

“Sally Churchill made it extremely 

clear, as has President Schlissel and 

Provost Philbert, that the regents 

wanted (the revisions) in yesterday, and 

they didn’t particularly care if there was 

time for debate, review, faculty input, as 

partly because of issues in the medical 

area and SMTD (School of Music, 

Theatre & Dance) when they decided 

that this was sort of non-negotiable,” 

Beatty said.

Beatty afterward noted that the 

University should have followed “the 

proper process” by consulting faculty 

when they made the decision to enact 

the new relationship policy. Atzmon 

voiced concerns with the new policy 

and its broad definitions of covered and 

romantic relationships.

SACUA member Deirdre Spencer, 

librarian for history of art, described 

her conversations with a civil rights 

committee, noting how there was 

concern with the broad definitions’ 

restrictions 
on 
non-academic 

communications between faculty and 

staff.

“You can’t even say, ‘Go Blue,’” 

Spencer said.

Riles noted how the Dearborn 

campus was also working on a faculty 

survey that would differ from the 

survey for the Ann Arbor and Flint 

campuses. As this is the first year 

Dearborn is using a faculty survey, 

the campus will provide their own 

questions for the survey.

After discussing changes to the 

survey, SACUA member Sarah Lippert, 

associate professor of art history, 

presented the Tri-Campus Committee 

resolution on the process of renewing 

administrators. She noted that one of 

the Tri-Campus Committee members 

had a dean on their campus who was 

approved for renewal without consulting 

faculty government.

“It’s now become such a snowball 

of a problem that we’re actually having 

to redo this person’s contract and redo 

the whole faculty consultation part a 

year after,” Lippert said. “We would 

like to see some minimum standards 

of faculty consultation, at the very least 

anonymous consultation of the faculty.” 

When Marsh noted how the Ann 

Arbor campus had an official from 

University Provost Martin Philbert’s 

office responsible for communicating 

with 
faculty 
in 
re-appointing 

administrators, Lippert replied the 

Dearborn and Flint campuses should 

have the same minimum consultation 

that is present at the Ann Arbor campus.

The 
committee 
subsequently 

hosted Kevin Hegarty, the University’s 

executive vice president and chief 

financial officer, to discuss financial 

operations at the University. After 

holding several high-level corporate 

positions, Hegarty was hired as the vice 

president and chief financial officer of 

the University of Texas at Austin, his 

alma mater. He worked there from 2001 

to 2015 until he was hired for his current 

position at the University of Michigan. 

Hegarty described how his prior 

experience informed his position in 

managing financial operations of the 

University.

“I was adamant when I came to the 

University of Texas — just as when I 

came to the University of Michigan — 

that I didn’t want to repeat what I saw in 

corporate. It’s also one of the reasons that 

I didn’t want to (go) back to corporate,” 

Hegarty said. “That was a culture that 

was really driven from the top down,” he 

said. “CEO says do it, so you do it, and you 

just get it done … I wanted to come here 

and connect people to a mission, to what 

this place really is all about.” 

After opening up for questions, 

Lippert and Beatty requested greater 

accountability 
on 
management 
of 

finances, 
especially 
for 
Flint 
and 

Dearborn campuses. There was also 

a focus on getting faculty government 

more involved in financial operations.

He also said each campus gets 

individual funding from the state of 

Michigan and sets its own tuition rates. 

He said the U-M Flint and Dearborn 

campuses’ tuition are around 80 

percent of the cost of tuition for the 

Ann Arbor campus. 

Schlissel said there are different 

communities on each campus, and this 

is reflected in the faculty on the three 

campuses. He said Ann Arbor is part 

of a global market, while U-M Flint 

and Dearborn are focused on hands-on 

education for students from the areas 

they are located in.

“It wouldn’t really be either right 

or good for Flint or Dearborn for me 

to sit here in Ann Arbor and tell them 

how they should spend their money and 

who they should be serving,” Schlissel 

said. “I don’t think if we had three 

Ann Arbors, one of which was in Flint 

and one of which was in Dearborn, we 

wouldn’t be serving the people of the 

state the same way or as well, as if we 

have one global research university and 

two regional campuses that are much 

more local in their focus.”

He said he oversees the chancellors 

at U-M Flint and U-M Dearborn, but the 

campuses are ultimately different with 

only partially overlapping populations. 

Schlissel noted the University’s Ann 

Arbor campus is the most selective 

university campus in the state and 

the Flint and Dearborn campuses are 

accessible to a broad range of students 

within their communities.

Part of this, he said, is because 

the Ann Arbor campus is noticeably 

comprised of students who come from 

wealthier 
backgrounds, 
while 
the 

Dearborn and Flint campuses better 

reflect the diversity of the state in the 

student populations on those campuses. 

He said this was one reason for the 

creation of the Go Blue Guarantee on 

the University’s Ann Arbor campus.

“The demographics of the campuses 

are different, so they really are three 

very 
distinguishable 
campuses,” 

Schlissel said. “The socioeconomic 

diversity of Flint and Dearborn much 

more closely mirror the diversity of 

our state, whereas Ann Arbor is skewed 

much more to students from wealthier 

background. The reason we’ve begun 

the Go Blue Guarantee here is to try to 

improve the socioeconomic diversity of 

students here on this campus.”

1U listed the Go Blue Guarantee’s 

nonexistence at U-M Dearborn and 

Flint as one main campaign issues, 

though 42 percent of U-M Dearborn 

students and 39 percent of U-M Flint 

students are eligible for the Pell Grant, 

a federal grant awarded to high-

achieving students with financial need. 

Schlissel said financial aid is a priority 

of all three campuses and a higher 

percentage of students receive financial 

aid at U-M Flint or Dearborn compared 

to students at the University’s Ann 

Arbor campus.

Schlissel 
also 
addressed 
1U’s 

complaints over the University’s Flint 

and Dearborn campuses not receiving 

any of the $85 million earmarked for 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion over 

five years nor any of the $1 billion in 

funding for student support from the 

Victors for Michigan campaign. He 

said the three campuses have separate 

fundraising and budgets for these 

University services and act differently 

within the contexts of the campus.

According to Schlissel, leaders from 

each campus have the opportunity to 

lobby independently for more resources 

to be allocated to their respective 

campuses and plans to continue to 

work with those leaders to increase 

funding 
allocations 
for 
all 
three 

campuses. Additionally, he said he 

would like the state to increase direct-

to-student 
financial 
aid, 
meaning 

a student can receive a need-based 

scholarship directly from the state that 

can be taken to whichever university 

the student chooses to attend.

“We’re lobbying together to try to 

grow the pot for each campus, keeping 

in mind each campus serves different 

communities 
and 
has 
different 

resources come to it,” Schlissel said. 

“I’m committed to working with Flint 

and Dearborn to grow their state 

allocation at the same time we work 

to grow the state allocation for Ann 

Arbor.”

Carbon Commission

Schlissel then addressed questions 

concerning 
student, 
faculty 
and 

corporate involvement in his new 

Commission on Carbon Neutrality. At 

the beginning of February, Schlissel 

officially announced the charge and 

members of his new Commission on 

Carbon Neutrality. The commission 

will define a goal and clarify the 

parameters for the University to 

achieve carbon neutrality, looking to 

achieve and surpass the University’s 

2011 goal of a 25 percent carbon 

emission reduction from the 2006 

standard by 2025. 

Noting the presence and direct 

involvement 
of 
students 
on 
the 

commission, Schlissel said the shared 

motivation between students and other 

commission members will be beneficial 

for the productivity of the board.

“We share the same goal,” Schlissel 

said. “The goal is to figure out as 

quickly as possible how to put us on a 

pathway to becoming carbon neutral in 

a way that’s sustainable, that allows us 

to continue our mission and continue 

to be an attractive place to come and 

study and to learn and to do research, 

and to do it in a way that serves as an 

example and in collaboration with the 

city around us, the county, the state, 

and to do it as a permanent rather than 

a short term fix.”

The 
committee, 
composed 
of 

University 
students 
and 
faculty 

members, also includes two members 

from 
major 
energy 
corporations. 

According to Schlissel, the members 

were meticulously chosen for their 

input.

“I quite purposefully asked those 

two 
major 
energy 
companies 
to 

suggest someone they thought would 

be helpful, and the reason why is they 

provide the overwhelming amount of 

energy throughout our state and region 

and to say we don’t want to hear their 

thoughts and learn their plans because 

of their emissions of greenhouse gas,” 

Schlissel said. “They’re not going 

away, they are the major suppliers of 

electricity for the University, the city of 

Ann Arbor, et cetera, so ignoring them 

because of past behavior, I don’t think 

that serves any purpose.”

Schlissel also noted that the two 

corporations, DTE and Consumers 

Energy, have personal incentive to 

improve their sustainability practices.

“Each of those companies recognizes 

that they are as adversely affected by 

global climate change as the University 

is,” Schlissel said. “Their business may 

go out of business because of it and 

they’re incentivized how they are going 

to shift from non-renewables and high 

carbon to low carbon sources of energy. 

One of them, DTE, their CEO told me 

our trajectory to get to 80 percent 

carbon free in their renewables in their 

portfolio over the coming decade so I 

would like to understand how they’re 

going to do this at the scale of the 

state of Michigan in a place where it 

gets to be minus 30-degree wind chill 

factors in the winter, so I wanted their 

expertise. 

He also noted that because the 

individuals from the energy industry 

only make up a small portion of 

commission, he is not too concerned 

about 
their 
opinions 
being 
too 

domineering. 

“The two industry folks are two 

members of a 16-person commission 

advisory so I’m not incredibly worried 

about the thoughtful students and 

the faculty and the campus leaders 

being overwhelmed by two people of 

industry.”

According 
to 
Schlissel, 
the 

commission’s first town hall will be a 

good opportunity for pressing student 

issues and concerns to be recognized.

“I’d 
love 
to 
understand 
which 

questions 
are 
front-of-mind 
for 

students,” Schlissel said. “In the 

flipside, I’d love the students to see the 

thoughtfulness and seriousness with 

which the members of the commission 

are taking this really important task.”

Felony Self-Disclosure

The University has implemented 

a new policy this February requiring 

members of the community to disclose 

all charges and convictions of felonies 

within a week of the charge or 

conviction. The policy applies to all 

faculty and staff, including student 

employees, volunteers and visiting 

scholars. According to the policy, 

those who do not disclose felonies will 

potentially face serious consequences, 

possibly including dismissal.

While University officials have said 

the policy was intended to ensure 

campus safety, some have raised 

concerns with the policy. Those against 

the policy say it infringes on rights, 

unfairly targets minorities, adds to 

invasive hiring procedures and lacked 

community input.

According to Schlissel, the creation 

of the policy is motivated by student 

and faculty safety, however there is 

a challenge to ensure the process is 

conducted in a fair way.

“The core of the policy change is 

to make sure we can provide a safe 

environment on our campus, in our 

health system, in all the different 

things we do as possible,” Schlissel 

said. “I think the advocates are very 

correct to be concerned about the 

disproportionate impact of the legal 

system on different subpopulations in 

our country. I think the evidence that 

that happens is incredibly strong. What 

we have to balance is being fair to every 

individual employee or applicant one 

person at a time, with the responsibility 

to keeping our community safe.”

Though he agreed it is a challenge 

to maintain fairness in the process, 

Schlissel said disclosing felony charges 

or convictions is important to ensure 

specific people are not a risk to certain 

positions on campus.

“Let’s 
say 
we 
have 
somebody 

working in the Treasurer’s Office 

of the University that had been 

convicted or charged elsewhere with 

embezzlement, with stealing money, 

and they do the same thing here and 

we never asked (about the charge or 

conviction),” Schlissel said. “It’s not an 

unreasonable thing for an employer to 

know whether a particular job a person 

is doing poses a particular risk based on 

them having been charged or convicted 

of a serious crime — not a trivial crime, 

but a serious crime. The challenge, in a 

way, is how to do that in a way that isn’t 

unfair to people.”

While the policy requires all faculty 

to report these felony charges or 

convictions, Schlissel said the findings 

are not always applicable, depending on 

the job the individual has.

“Just because you’ve been convicted 

of a serious crime doesn’t mean you 

should never work — you have to be able 

to support yourself,” Schlissel said. “So 

the idea is to do this as a confidential 

process where the leadership and our 

campus-wide human resources group 

looks at these self-reports and says, 

‘Well, this person was arrested or 

convicted or a crime that has nothing 

to do with their job, they’re not a risk, 

we’re going to keep that information 

confidential, the supervisors are not 

going to know about it,’ and that person 

will go about their business.”

Schlissel 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of keeping track of the 

demographics of those impacted by the 

policy. 

“It’s a balancing act,” Schlissel 

said. “What we’re going to have to 

do prospectively is look at how the 

demographics 
works 
out 
in 
this 

program. If we were to get 100 reports 

a year out of our 40,000 employees of 

someone being convicted of a felony, we 

want to make sure the peoples whose 

jobs are being moved or changed or 

lost aren’t disproportionately in one 

identifiable group or another.”

Free Speech

Schlissel then moved on to discuss 

free speech and the upcoming visit from 

conservative 
political 
commentator 

Ben Shapiro. This is not the first time 

the University has dealt with issues 

regarding the First Amendment, as 

seen with last year’s potential visit 

from Richard Spencer and a lawsuit 

from Speech First.

Shapiro’s visit, which will occur on 

Tuesday evening, will be hosted by 

the University’s chapter of the Young 

Americans for Freedom. While Shapiro 

has been accused of using transphobic, 

homophobic and anti-choice rhetoric, 

free tickets reserved for students sold 

out in less than two minutes of being 

released.

Schlissel explained it was important 

for the University to allow student 

groups to invite the speakers they want 

on campus, even if the individual may 

have offensive rhetoric.

“To be a University we have to be 

open to ideas, even ones that many of 

us may find offensive,” Schlissel said. “I 

don’t have to go listen to the talk, but 

similarly we can’t set up a way to tell a 

student group who they’re allowed to or 

who they’re not allowed to invite. Once 

you give away that right, someone will 

decide they don’t want to hear about 

your issue because it’s too difficult.”

He also explained the University 

remains neutral with issues regarding 

free speech because deciding what 

qualifies 
as 
“offensive” 
can 
be 

challenging.

“Who would you trust to make the 

call about what’s offensive?” Schlissel 

said. “No one has figured out how to do 

that. So, you really have to be content-

neutral. Just because someone speaks 

here at the University, in no way means 

the University as an entity is endorsing 

what they have to say.”

However, 
more 
than 
issues 
of 

the 
First 
Amendment, 
Schlissel 

emphasized his responsibility is to 

protect students’ rights to choose 

whom to listen to and whom to invite 

on campus.

“Some people say we’re protecting 

the 
First 
Amendment,” 
Schlissel 

said. “The First Amendment, I’m not 

responsible for that. I’m responsible 

for you. So what I’m really protecting 

is your right to decide who you’d like 

to invite and come give a talk, or your 

choice about who you want to listen to. 

Who you shouldn’t be allowed to listen 

to, I think we should be cautious about 

that.”

Ethical Food Practices

Lastly, Schlissel discussed ethical 

food practices on campus, which 

comes after public comments from 

the last Board of Regents meeting, 

as well as conversation in Central 

Student Government and Ann Arbor 

City Council, about the presence of fast 

food chain Wendy’s at the University. 

The Coalition of Immokalee Workers, 

student organizers and community 

members were concerned about the 

chain’s presence on campus because 

of its refusal to join the Fair Food 

Program.

While Schlissel noted that Wendy’s 

decided not to pursue a request to 

come back to the Michigan Union 

when it reopens, he acknowledged the 

importance of discussions regarding 

ethical food practices on campus. He 

explained how, a few years back, the 

University made an effort to look at 

where athletic apparel — anything 

with a Block ‘M’ — came from, and 

considered the possibility of a similar 

process for food on campus.

“Students have proposed that we 

consider a similar approach to the 

sourcing of other things the University 

buys, and that’s a reason issue to look 

at and explore, and the same committee 

(President’s Advisory Committee on 

Labor Standards and Human Rights) 

has been tasked at looking at this issue 

… and to do an analysis,” Schlissel said.

Stephen Berrey, associate professor 

of American culture, said blackface 

appearing in yearbooks is a prime 

example of how this form of racism 

was considered “safe” or acceptable 

in 
many 
communities, 
including 

Northam’s medical school, relatively 

recently.

“There’s a reason why this 1984 

yearbook pops out there and then kind 

of disappears for however many years 

it’s been,” Berrey said. “It’s because, 

at the time, it was not a big deal in that 

community for these white people. 

And that’s important to note — if it’s in 

the yearbook, it means that it was safe 

for those white people. Which means, 

of course, that blackface was safe and 

normal all over the country well into 

the 1970s.”

Berrey 
explained 
a 
blackface 

photograph in a yearbook does not 

only represent the beliefs of one or 

two students, but instead reflects the 

culture of an entire community.

“If we look at that yearbook, we may 

think that’s Ralph Northam or maybe 

somebody else,” Berrey said. “It’s those 

two students, but it’s more than that. 

It’s the layout person, it’s the editor, 

it’s the staff, it’s the faculty, it’s the 

administrator, if it’s a high school it’s 

the school board, it’s the community. 

There’s a complicity. The reason why 

we don’t know about all of these axes 

is that nobody cared about them at the 

time who was in these communities. 

There’s a complicity that is perfectly 

okay.”

Similarly, Bethany Hughes, assistant 

professor 
of 
American 
culture 

and Native American Studies, said 

appropriation 
of 
Native 
American 

culture did not arise from offensive 

Halloween 
costumes 
or 
school 

mascots, but actually began as early as 

the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Hughes 

said the Americans’ choice to dress 

in what they believed was Native 

American clothing reflects the deeper 

history of cultural exploitation.

“It was not necessarily to disguise 

their identity, maybe a little bit, but it 

was a way of taking on a persona and 

in some sense claiming indigeneity 

to America, that we are made here, 

and also claiming this sort of warrior, 

aggressive action,” Hughes said. “The 

history of redface doesn’t start in 

popular culture entertainment — it 

actually starts in civic and political 

protest as far as an American identity 

around redface. There is a longer 

history 
of 
redface 
in 
imported 

European entertainment and theater.”

Hughes noted how the popularity 

of redface in contemporary American 

culture disregards and undermines the 

differences between Native American 

communities.

“There’s this embodied knowledge of 

what it means to see and recognize an 

Indian, that then is imported directly 

into film and television,” Hughes said. 

“The markers that are identifiably 

Sioux … that are Oglala, that are 

Lakota, all of those get imported into 

a generic Indian identity that then get 

picked up and can be utilized in film 

and television.”

LSA 
freshman 
Caroline 
Reed 

attended the panel and said the 

discussion 
made 
her 
think 
more 

deeply about a blackface incident she 

experienced.

“I was at a relative’s house helping 

them clean out some stuff and came 

across a photo of them in blackface, 

and I got nervous so I put it back in the 

box and didn’t say anything about it,” 

Reed said. “I didn’t acknowledge that I 

even found it, I just kind of went about 

my life. Obviously it’s a generational 

difference, but as an 18-year-old, I felt 

really angry at why they would even 

do that. I was just wondering how to 

address it and learn from that negative 

problem.”

Reed said the panelists’ presentations 

on redface and yellowface allowed 

her 
to 
understand 
that 
cultural 

appropriation is an issue that affects 

many different communities in equally 

devastating ways.

“I hear about blackface a lot, but 

I never really thought about the 

implications of redface and yellowface 

and how that affects other races,” Reed 

said. “I think that stood out to me a lot, 

that it’s not limited to one stereotype 

and extends to all kinds of different 

people.”

APPROPRIATION
From Page 1

“There 
will 
be 
plenty 
of 

opportunity for the public and 

community to comment suggestions 

and priorities and so on, but you 

have to keep in mind that this is an 

advisory panel only,” Forrest said. 

“We make recommendations, we are 

not the ones who make the decisions, 

that is the sole purview of the Board 

of Regents, the president and the 

executive officers.”

An 
audience 
member 
asked 

how 
residents 
can 
ensure 
the 

commission’s work will not be 

guided by interests of corporations. 

Haverkamp said the commission 

needs to take in the perspective of 

different stakeholders in order to 

have accurate representation.

Forrest 
said 
because 
the 

commission 
does 
not 
make 

decisions, corporate interests are 

not as relevant.

“There is not a lot of self-interest 

here,” Forrest said. “This is a 

volunteer board. Again, we do not 

make the decision. So it separates 

the money interest from the decision 

making conference. Our job is really 

to distill data and to do the best we 

can to recommend the best path 

forward.”

Another audience member asked 

how the commission is going to 

foster long-term solutions and keep 

the community updated on any 

progress made. Haverkamp said the 

commission will produce interim 

reports along the way that will be 

made public, and the committee is 

always open to suggestions from 

residents.

Forrest said open communication 

between the commission and the 

community is integral to reducing 

carbon emissions.

“So much of the commission’s 

work 
will 
be 
communication,” 

Forrest said. “If we can’t engage the 

entire University community, that 

is a sign that people just don’t care. 

But that’s not something I believe, I 

think people care.”

Rackham student Aaron Gladstein 

said he attended the event to have 

an accurate understanding of how 

the University is working to reduce 

its carbon footprint. He was pleased 

with 
the 
receptiveness 
of 
the 

commission. 

“I like how open the commission 

currently 
is,” 
Gladstein 
said. 

“I thought I was coming into 

something, like a premade game 

plan, and instead this is more they 

are ready to listen.”

LSA freshman Lena Swirczek is 

the co-president of the University’s 

chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby. 

She 
said 
she 
also 
appreciated 

how open the commission was 

to audience suggestions and how 

dedicated they seemed to the cause. 

However, she discussed how she is 

worried the Board of Regents will 

not put as much effort into reducing 

the University’s carbon emissions.

“I’m more confident now that 

the commission is actively working 

towards making recommendations 

and solutions,” Swirczek said. “My 

one concern is how regents are going 

to handle that. My biggest takeaway 

is that they’re going to do their best 

to do their research and put in the 

time and the effort and consult with 

who they need to consult so that we 

can move forward on this issue, but 

I’m just concerned that the regents 

will not act with the same urgency 

and expertise.”

about cutting long hair,” Dascola said.

For more than 50 years, Dascola 

has continued the family tradition. 

But he said it may end soon.

“There 
isn’t 
anybody 
coming 

behind me at this point in time,” he 

said. “My granddaughter was talking 

about becoming a hair person, but 

she’s still in high school, so it’s hard 

to say what’s going to happen at this 

point … you can’t make your children 

or grandchildren do stuff they don’t 

want to do and if she decides not to do 

that, that’s okay. That’s her choice.”

Though none of his children aspire 

to become barbers, he said they help 

out at the shop in different ways. His 

youngest daughter used to clean his 

shop as a child, his oldest daughter 

helps out financially and his son has 

built him his website. Dascola said 

he’s proud of his kids because they 

find different ways to help him out.

Dascola said he has had to hire 

outside people to help out in the shop. 

He added it isn’t easy to find qualified 

people.

“Everybody has their own talents 

and finding people that are good with 

people and their skills with doing the 

haircutting is not the easiest thing in 

the world,” Dascola said. “It takes a 

combination of things: You have to 

have the right personality for this 

type of job … and you have to shave 

skills to be able to accomplish good 

hair cutting because if you can’t do 

the good haircutting, there’s no point 

in doing a good haircutting at all.” 

Dascola is proud of his shop’s 

location in the heart of downtown 

Ann Arbor and the University of 

Michigan campus.

“At one point in time, when we 

were getting close to closing the 

original store, somebody tried to get 

me to move off of the campus, and 

I wouldn’t leave and I said, ‘I’m not 

leaving downtown,’” Dascola said. “I 

was born and raised downtown and 

I’m going to continue my whole career 

downtown. And the reason is, I love 

being around the University because 

I need the cultural and intellectual 

experience 
from 
my 
professor 

friends who love to teach outside the 

classroom. For the last 50 years, I’ve 

gotten a pretty good education.”

Dascola said his business has an 

impact on community and culture, 

which he said differentiates his 

business from others in Ann Arbor.

“I would say that when people 

come to my place, it’s more of a 

cultural and intellectual experience 

as opposed to the sports scene and all 

that business,” Dascola said. “I mean, 

I’m okay with football and stuff. I’m a 

really big hockey fan, but I don’t bring 

sports to my business. I bring cultural 

and intellectual things because I’m 

pursuing knowledge and I want to 

learn as many things as I can from 

people because we’re always teaching 

each other things.”

One 
of 
Dascola’s 
long-time 

customers and University alum Chris 

Kushmaul said he’s built a strong 

relationship with Dascola since 1993 

when he first began going to his shop.

“He’s far more than just a barber,” 

Kushmaul said. “I mean, he’s literally 

become a friend. He’s like a father to 

me. And it’s one barber visit at a time. 

We’ve just built a relationship.”

When customers sit down to get a 

haircut, they face a mirror filled with 

pictures of his clients. Some pictures 

showcase customers from birth to old 

age.

“I call it my happy mirror,” Dascola 

said. “Every day when I walk in 

there, and I turn the light on the back 

counter and I hang up my fanny pack, 

the first thing I see is all those smiling 

faces looking at me and so it’s like 

welcoming me back to work.”

LSA junior Eric Donarski said he 

is very excited for the shop’s 80th 

anniversary and added he feels at 

home whenever he gets a haircut 

there.

“Not only is he excellent at 

cutting hair, but Bob has a breadth 

of 
knowledge 
to 
keep 
anybody 

entertained and barely focused on 

their haircut,” Donarski wrote in an 

email interview. “Dascola Barbers has 

become a place that feels like home to 

me and I’m sure it will for anybody 

who schedules an appointment.”

T

he 
division 
of 
the 

Democratic 
Party 

is 
inevitable 
given 

the 
rhetoric 
Democratic 

colleagues use when they 
exchange words with each 
other. Whether it be House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
arguing U.S. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New 
Deal 
as 
insignificant 
or 

the disorganization behind 
what substantive health care 
reform looks like, there seems 
to be a lack of consensus on 
issues of great importance to 
the country.

The new progressive wing 

of the Democratic Party that 
has foisted individuals such 
as Ocasio-Cortez into the 
forefront of national politics 
is 
actually 
hurting 
the 

Democratic Party more than 
it is helping it. While I would 
personally like to see basic 
legislation on climate change 
passed in response to our 
decaying planet, is the fact 
that there is any opposition 
at all within the party reason 
enough to stop fighting for 
the cause? Democrats face 
somewhat of an impossible 
dilemma: act in self-interest 
to keep personal popularity 
within the media and pursue 
policy that fragments the 
party, or act only in the 
interest of unifying the party 
under one ideology.

Today, it is clear that the 

more popular choice is the 
former. Nothing is sexy about 
following the rules. People 
want to see a trailblazer 
come in with new ideas that 
make change seem palpable. 
However, in 2019, this might 
come at too great a cost. 
In the wake of the Trump 
presidency, the Republican 
Party appears clearly split 
between 
nationalistic 

and 
institutional 
wings. 

With 
the 
2020 
election 

approaching, Democrats can 
take advantage of this split in 
places like Michigan to win 
the White House.

Let’s explore how party 

fragmentation has manifested 
within 
matters 
of 
policy 

by looking at how climate 
change has been dealt with. 
While most Democrats are in 
favor of passing legislation to 
combat climate change, the 
Senate 
Democratic 
caucus 

is still not on board with 
the Green New Deal due to 
its progressive nature. The 
result is inconsistent policy 
within the party. In the 
house, Pelosi has proposed 
creating a Select Committee 
on 
the 
Climate 
Crisis. 

However, 
the 
committee 

won’t have the ability to send 
legislation to the House for 
a vote, not create it or even 
subpoena for hearings. While 
U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fl. 
and chair of the committee, 
has promised the committee 

recognizes the “urgency to 
reduce 
carbon 
pollution,” 

several members, including 
Castor herself, have accepted 
altogether 
hundreds 
of 

thousands 
of 
dollars 
in 

campaign 
donations 
from 

fossil fuel companies. This 
select committee was created 
in 
“spirit” 
of 
the 
Green 

New Deal, but its lack of 
substantive power delineates 
from this purpose. This is 
further seen as U.S. Rep. 
Frank 
Pallone, 
D-NJ 
and 

chair of the House Committee 
on Energy and Commerce, has 

stated that policies narrowly 
tailored to immediate action 
are required, contrary to the 
broad-stroked 10-year policy 
plans of the Green New Deal. 
The list of contradictions 
goes on. While Pallone will 
take one direction within his 
committee, 
Ocasio-Cortez 

will take another as she 
serves on the subcommittee 
on the Environment within 
the Committee of Oversight 
and Reform. The inconsistent 
policy 
stance 
is 
bound 

to 
create 
contradicting 

policies, or no substantive 
policies that address the 
issue at all. Progressives 
must 
ask 
themselves, 
if 

the general theme of their 
preferred 
policies 
are 

embedded within the party, 
is it worth it to constantly be 
spearheading a more specific 
version 
of 
their 
plan? 

Inconsistent 
policies 
are 

evidence of fraction within 
the party that will leave it 
vulnerable to struggling in 
elections in the future.

Modern day factionalism 

apparent 
in 
these 
issues 

is no longer conducive to 
the civic politic. Moreover, 
it is counterproductive to 
what the framers of the 
Constitution 
intended. 

In “Federalist 10,” James 
Madison wrote about the 
later coined theory of the 
“tyranny of the majority” 
— an idea that warned that 
one faction would dominate 
the 
political 
process 
by 

overpowering 
all 
other 

minority factions. Today, I 
would argue that we must 
worry about the “tyranny 
of the obstinate” — a notion 
that I ascribe to immutable 
political players who are 
able 
to 
manipulate 
and 

halt the entire democratic 
process. The best example 

of 
this 
tyranny 
coming 

into play comes from Ralph 
Nader’s spoiler effect in the 
2000 election. Yes, I know 
Nader isn’t even a Democrat. 
However, 
when 
it 
came 

down to it, who do you think 
would better represent the 
Green Party’s interests? I 
see Al Gore in his blazer 
and button-up on a different 
ad for some climate change 
documentary 
every 
other 

day. The answer is glaring.

In the era of the 24-hour 

news cycle, the progressive 
faction has been able to 
pursue 
the 
opportunities 

that the media has presented 
to 
make 
viewers 
more 

extreme. The current process 
of 
the 
progressive 
wing 

however is obstinate because 
its interest is not centered 
around 
compromise. 
It 

has used a “my way or the 
highway” approach that is 
made possible by the extreme 
nature 
of 
media. 
It 
has 

become easy to rile people up 
about an issue. This division 
of 
the 
Democratic 
Party 

may just cost it the election 
in 2020. I know it is naive 
to say that every political 
faction should just work into 
the existing coalition of the 
two-party system cemented 
into 
American 
politics, 

but in 2019, the stakes are 
simply higher. My view is 
that 
progressives 
should 

compromise now, so that 
key aspects of their desired 
change can happen later.

Our pluralist government 

is designed so that this can 
happen. Research has shown 
that 
among 
individuals 

who voted for Obama in 
2012 as well as a third-
party 
candidate 
in 
2016, 

Democratic 
identification 

has decreased by 35 percent. 
The effects of a splitting 
Democratic 
Party 
could 

very 
well 
influence 
the 

Republican Party’s success. 
Think about it this way — 
as the party swings further 
to the left, the policies that 
progressives are proposing 
will eventually make it to the 
forefront.

While 
I 
myself 
have 

views that are in line with 
the progressive faction of 
the party, I believe that 
since 
Trump-era 
policies 

are so far removed from any 
liberal resolve, factions from 
the Democratic Party must 
unite to secure a victory for 
the preservation of any sort 
of liberal agenda. Though 
the direness of the issues 
progressives 
have 
taken 

on 
continues 
to 
persist, 

the 
alternative 
is 
simply 

too grave to imagine. The 
only thing left to do is 
compromise.

Israel, the NRA and the danger of partisanship

R

ight 
now, 
many 

Republicans reflexively 
oppose any Democratic 

proposal 
or 
idea 
and 
the 

inverse is true as well. This is 
because of something called 
“negative 
partisanship.” 

Politico 
Magazine 
defines 

this as when “the parties 
hang 
together 
mainly 
out 

of sheer hatred of the other 
team, rather than a shared 
sense of purpose.” Through 
this lens, a lot of things make 
more sense; I’d like to use it to 
look at an example of negative 
partisanship 
through 
the 

National Rifle Association and 
how a similar phenomenon is 
possible with Israel.

Today, 
the 
NRA 
is 

overwhelmingly 
associated 

with 
the 
Republican 

Party. Whether it be with 
immigration, 
President 

Donald Trump or many other 
issues, the NRA is more tied 
to the right than ever. In 
fact, the current president of 
the NRA is a former Reagan 
administration official who 
ran for Senate as a Republican 
in 1994. Moreover, most of 
the money the NRA spends 
is on Republicans and most 
of the candidates it endorses 
are Republicans.

In 
fact, 
in 
2016, 
the 

NRA spent 99 percent of its 
campaign contributions on 
Republicans. The strong ties 
to the right have seemingly 
paid off — it has a direct line 
to the president it helped put 
in office. However, it is worth 
noting that this has come at a 
substantial cost.

In 1992 — just 26 years 

ago — Democrats got 37 
percent of NRA funds. The 
NRA used to also endorse 
(and fund) a lot more liberal 
Democrats. 
Once 
upon 
a 

time, 
Michigan’s 
foremost 

leading light of liberalism, 
John Dingell, regularly got 
an A+ rating from the NRA. 
Today, 
the 
best-known 

progressives abhor the NRA 
and presidential candidates 
who used to be cozy with it 
have all but declared war on 
it. Former President Barack 

Obama was no dear friend 
of the NRA, but he was 
certainly not as much of an 
enemy as today’s Democratic 
presidential candidates are.

Similarly, 
today 
more 

than ever before, support of 
Israel has become a partisan 
issue. Traditionally, Israel 
enjoyed strong cross-party, 
cross-ideology support — but 
that has started to change. 
Per the Pew Research Center, 
“79% 
of 
Republicans 
say 

they sympathize more with 
Israel than the Palestinians, 
compared with just 27% of 
Democrats.” Further in the 
poll it says that “(n)early three 
times as many Republicans 
(52%) as Democrats (18%) 
have favorable impressions 
of Israel’s leader (Benjamin 
Netanyahu).”

This divide is bigger than 

it has been in years and part 
of the reason might stem from 
the strong embrace of Trump 
by Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu. 
Netanyahu 

has welcomed Trump in a 
public way, going so far as to 
include Trump on billboards 
in his re-election campaign, 
and Trump has more than 
returned the embrace — one 
demonstration of this was 
moving the U.S. embassy 
to Jerusalem. Before this, 
Netanyahu 
had 
worked 

to 
strengthen 
his 
ties 

to 
conservatives. 
At 
the 

invitation 
of 
then 
House 

Speaker 
John 
Boehner, 

he spoke against the Iran 
nuclear deal to a joint session 
of 
Congress. 
Netanyahu 

also appointed Ron Dermer, 
a 
former 
assistant 
to 

Republican 
pollster 
Frank 

Luntz, as his ambassador to 
the United States.

Doing all of this has 

massively strengthened ties 
with the right — but this 
lunch wasn’t free. This is 
similar to the NRA because 
in both cases, the group 
chose to move right and when 
the NRA did so, it had a cost. 
It no longer had Democratic 
supporters in the halls of 
Congress and, consequently, 

their favored policy positions 
no longer had Democratic 
votes. As of now, the NRA and 
the Democrats may as well be 
the Hatfields and McCoys.

More of this has to do 

with negative partisanship 
more 
than 
anything 

else — the NRA became 
Republicans, 
Democrats 

don’t like Republicans, ipso 
facto Democrats don’t like 
the 
NRA. 
If 
Netanyahu 

continues 
his 
personal 

rightward drift, there is no 
reason that this could not 
happen for Israel as well. 
Already, record numbers of 
liberals sympathize with the 
Palestinians over Israel and I 
believe that the more support 
for Netanyahu is viewed as a 
proxy for support for Trump, 
the less support for both 
Netanyahu and Israel there 
will be.

The NRA’s actions over the 

past 30 years are a good guide 
of how to make half the country 
reflexively disagree with you 
because of association with 
other principles over which 
there is disagreement. If the 
NRA stayed about guns and 
never fought the culture war, 
they would still enjoy the 
broad support they once did. 
However, they made a choice 
to embrace the right. Similarly, 
Netanyahu going out of his 
way to embrace Trump (and 
arguably 
equate 
support 

for Trump with support for 
Israel) will lead to Israel’s 
favorability 
falling 
further 

on the left thanks to negative 
partisanship.

This 
happening 
would 

be a tragedy. We depend on 
the Israelis and they depend 
on us — they have been an 
important 
ally 
and 
friend 

since 
their 
founding, 
and 

they will hopefully remain 
one in the future. However, 
this is not possible if Israel 
becomes associated with the 
right instead of with American 
national interests.

Are brick-and-mortar stores really just a thing of the past?
T

he year 2018 was arguably 
one of the strongest 
for e-commerce, with 

“sales 
in 
the 
first 

quarter (soaring) 16.4 
percent from a year 
ago to a new record 
of $123.7 billion,” as 
reported by the United 
States 
Department 

of Commerce. While 
some of the more 
“online-averse” retail 
stores such as gas and 
car dealerships seem 
protected from this 
digital threat, the rest seem to be 
in full combat with e-commerce. 
And evidently, they’re losing. The 
threat of imminent bankruptcy 
facing stores such as Sears and 
JCPenney are perhaps telling of a 
new era in American commerce. 
With 
an 
impending 
store 

bankruptcy doomsday expected 
by most all of Wall Street, we 
must wonder whether brick-and-
mortar retail has truly reached 
its end.

The truth is quite a conflicting 

one. While traditionally brick-
and-mortar 
retail 
companies 

have begun to set aside more 
investments for their online stores, 
the exact opposite is happening 
among the e-commerce giants. 
Amazon’s decision to invest in 
Whole Foods was especially 
indicative of this. Even against the 
growth of online grocery in big-
name brands such as Kroger and 
Walmart, Amazon seems bent 
on the future prospects of estate-
based grocery, poising itself to 
open its own grocery stores (aside 
from its ownership of Whole 
Foods) around the U.S. It doesn’t 
end there. The e-commerce giant 

has plans to expand its retail 

bookstore, as well as its new 
4-Star Store.

And they might be onto 

something. Seemingly countering 
the trend toward e-commerce, 
it turns out that brick-and-
mortar still make up 90 percent 
of all retail sales. In fact, in 2017, 
America’s more successful retail 
brands reported a net increase 

of 4,000 new store openings. 
Nevertheless, Statista reports 
that there was a net decrease 

of 400 department 
stores during that 
same year.

These 

contradictory trends 
are indicative of some 
underlying truths. It 
seems fairly evident 
that traditional retail 
is 
fairly 
outdated. 

Iconic brands that 
have 
relied 
on 
a 

conservative strategy 

were attacked head-on by the 
e-commerce upstarts and have 
lost too much blood in the ensuing 
onslaught. At the same time, other 
more adaptive retail giants have 
recognized this change in trends 
and have slowly transformed 
the industry to a point where 
technology meets the personal 
touch of a salesperson.

Part of this is due to the 

fact that some retail sectors are 
simply refusing to be taken over 
by e-commerce. As previously 
mentioned, commodities such 
as gas and groceries have fought 
back fairly strongly, as customers 
have reiterated the need for 
person-to-person 
interaction 

with such items. Rather, the 
strongest players in the market 
have shown the ability to adapt 
to these changes by providing 
strong, 
interactive 
online 

platforms that offer a level of 
physical and digital connectivity 
that was otherwise absent from 
the industry a decade ago.

And this might just be the 

golden approach to this problem. 
The reinforcement of the personal 
customer experience is the key 
to winning the retail game. As 
we see continued strides in the 
technology 
behind 
artificial 

intelligence, it becomes more and 
more important to value “soft 
skills” over more technical skills. 
While some stores will still try 
to fully depend on e-commerce, 
we are seeing that in many cases, 
people still enjoy the social 
experience of going out to the 

mall and other physical stores. 
What’s perhaps more interesting 
is the fact that 70 percent of 
shoppers want malls to combine 
the shopping experience with 
entertainment activities. Malls 
are 
actively 
transforming 
to 

emphasize community gathering 
places, event spaces and galleries 
over the traditional department 
stores and food courts.

That said, what about more 

traditional retail stores such 
as Walmart and Target? These 
“hypermarkets” 
have 
little 

semblance 
to 
scaled 
malls, 

making it difficult to create “social 
gathering” places. That’s not to 
say that these stores don’t have a 
future, however. Walmart CEO 
Doug McMillon notes that the key 
to making chore-like activities like 
grocery shopping more attractive 
lies in integration of artificial 
intelligence 
with 
stores 
and 

e-commerce to most efficiently 
elevate 
customer 
experiences. 

Systems likes in-store pickup offer 
cheaper and, in some cases, more 
accessible options for purchasing 
items, and the experience stands 
to be strengthened by upcoming 
technologies 
such 
as 
smart 

shopping carts and in-store drone 
assistance.

Also somewhat interesting 

is the idea of the cashless 
store, pioneered by Amazon, 
that allows for customers to 
buy products online at a brick-
and-mortar shop. While this 
idea has faced some resistance 
by lawmakers, it’s indicative 
of the future trends that are 
overtaking retail.

Ultimately, in this case, we 

must not fall into the trap of 
believing the brick and mortar 
naysayers. We are on the brink 
of a major transformation in the 
retail scene that will inevitably 
change the face of the consumer 
shopping experience. So buckle 
up and get ready — physical 
retail is here to stay.

MUSIC REVIEW

DEF JAM

I remember watching an 
MTV special on 2 Chainz around 
2012, where I was surprised to 
learn the dope-slinging trap 
rapper graduated high school 
as the salutatorian and landed 
a scholarship to play basketball. 
And yet, in the end he chose hip 
hop, recording hits like “I’m 
Different” and “Birthday Song” 
and becoming one of the most 
desired features in the industry 
($100K for a verse). All those 
past collaborations would come 
back around for this album 
with a superstar list of guests: 
Marsha 
Ambrosius, 
Young 
Thug, 
Travis 
Scott, 
Kendrick 
Lamar, 
Ariana 
Grande, Ty Dolla 
$ign, Lil Wayne, 
E-40, 
Chance 
the Rapper and 
Kodak Black.
The title Rap or 
Go to the League 
is both a nod to 
2 Chainz’s own 
past choice and 
a reference to the widely-held 
belief of young people trapped 
in the hood — the only way out 
is to rap or go to “the league.”
Right from the beginning, 
2 Chainz makes it clear that 
this is not a trap album. On the 
soulful “Forgiven,” he laments 
the dangerous decisions he 
made as a kid and mourns the 
loss of his friends’ children 
who died too young. However, 
the introspective tone of the 
album is quick to fall apart. By 
the time “Whip” starts playing, 
the 
personal, 
from-the-soul 
theme is out the window, both 
sonically and lyrically.

2 Chainz attempts to occupy 
just about every lane of hip 
hop at once on this record: a 
west-coast style DJ Mustard 
track 
(“2 
Dollar 
Bill”), 
a 
modern Southern sound on 
his collaborations with Young 
Thug and Travis Scott (“High 
Top Versace” and “Whip”), 
and even a borderline pop-rap 
record with Ariana Grande 
(“Rule 
the 
World”). 
Quite 
frankly, this album is all over 
the place.
That’s not to say 2 Chainz 
has never dabbled in most of 
these subgenres before, but one 
sound that was completely new 
was the MF Doom-esque song 
“Threat 2 Society.” Packed with 
complex rhymes over a soul 

sample-based beat, 2 Chainz 
proves he can go toe-to-toe 
with 
lyrically-gifted 
artists 
like Earl Sweatshirt. Based on 
this song, a Madlib-produced 
2 Chainz album (in the vein 
of Freddie Gibbs and Madlib’s 
Piñata) might be a match made 
in heaven. Despite all the big-
name features on this album, 
“Threat 2 Society,” a solo track, 
might be one of the best songs.
Don’t get it twisted — just 
about all the collaborators came 
through on this album despite 
its weak points. “2 Dollar Bill” 
has an annoying hook, but Lil 
Wayne and E-40 bring so much 

heat that it almost saves the 
song. Chance the Rapper’s gives 
a mellow-cool verse on “I’m 
Not Crazy, Life Is” that almost 
offsets the disappointing Kodak 
Black verse on the same track. 
But no artist came through 
harder than Kendrick Lamar 
did on “Momma I Hit a Lick,” a 
unique and ominous Pharrell-
produced track. A collaboration 
in the truest sense of the word, 
2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar 
seamlessly share the hook and 
bleed into each other’s verses.
For each high point, however, 
there is a low. The only time 
2 Chainz tries to address the 
idea that there are more paths 
out of the hood than rap and 
basketball is on the outro to 
“NCAA” 
— 
otherwise, 
nothing 
ties 
this 
record 
together 
outside 
the 
first few songs. 
“High 
Top 
Versace” 
and 
“Whip” 
are 
decent, 
but 
sound 
like 
Young 
Thug 
and 
Travis 
Scott 
b-sides. 
The last track, “Sam,” could 
have been cut and the album 
would’ve been better off for it.
Rap or Go to the League is 
paradoxical, an unremarkable 
album filled with super high 
peaks. 2 Chainz flexes a near 
unmatchable level of versatility, 
but lacks any consistency in 
sound or message. The record 
itself may not be worth listening 
to again in a few months 
time, but tracks like “Threat 
2 Society” or “Momma I Hit 
a Lick” will make permanent 
homes in Spotify listeners’ 
playlists.

2 Chainz is versatile and 
scattered on new album

Stephen 
Sondheim’s 
most 
underrated musical “Merrily 
We Roll Along” took the stage 
of 
the 
Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theatre the weekend before 
Spring 
Break. 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
newest professional theatrical 
company, 
Runyonland 
Productions (founded by School 
of Music, Theatre and Dance 
senior Thomas Laub), headed 
this ambitious project.
“Merrily We Roll Along,” a 
musical with a book by George 
Furth and lyrics and music by 
Stephen Sondheim, is based 
on a play of the same name by 
George S. Kaufman and Moss 
Hart. The musical follows the 
journey of Franklin Shepard 
(SMTD senior Liam Allen), 
a world renowned Broadway 
composer who abandoned his 
friends and collaborators for 
the commercialized lifestyle of 
Hollywood. The musical starts 
at the height of his Hollywood 
career 
and 
works 
its 
way 
backwards in time, showing 
snapshots of Shepard’s most 
important relationships — with 

his then wife Beth (SMTD 
senior Emilie Kouatchou), his 
major 
collaborators 
lyricist 
Charley (SMTD junior Wilson 
Plonk) and writer Mary (SMTD 
sophomore Erica Ito).
In past experiences with 
this show, I have left feeling 
rather saddened by the life of 
Franklin Shepard. However, 
under the direction of SMTD 
senior Megumi Nakamura, I 
left Runyonland Production’s 
version of “Merrily” feeling 
rather, well, merry. Nakamura’s 
message in her director’s note 
at the beginning of the program 
that “the idea that no matter 
where we are in our lives and 
no matter the mistakes we 
have made, it is never too late 
to take responsibility for your 
choices 
and 
move 
forward 
with positivity, love, and hope” 
shines through tremendously in 
her take on this musical.
The actors’ portrayal of these 
classically 
tragic 
characters 
helped a great deal in bringing 
Nakamura’s 
optimistic 
perspective on “Merrily” to life. 
In particular, Ito’s portrayal of 
Mary had a glimmer of hope 
that I have yet to see brought 
to life in many actresses take 

on this famous role. Ito brought 
a sense of spunk and ambition 
to the character, giving Mary, 
a character that can easily be 
portrayed one dimensionally, a 
sense of emotional resonance 
and depth. In addition to being 
a captivating actor, Ito’s musical 
talents also shined through 
during 
her 
performance, 
particularly in her song closing 
Act One, “Now You Know.” 

This was perhaps my favorite 
number of the evening. Ito’s 
combined acting chops and 
musical talents allowed her 
performance to be among the 

most exciting on the stage.
The night I went to see 
“Merrily,” 
Wilson 
Plonk 
(Charley) 
was 
unable 
to 
perform vocally due to illness. 
While Plonk physically took 
to the stage, the vocals behind 
Charley’s 
lines 
and 
songs 
were 
delivered 
backstage 
by 
Runyonland 
producer 
Thomas Laub. Due to Plonk’s 
commitment 
and 
Laub’s 

impeccable 
timing, 
I 
often 
forgot the character of Charley 
was being dubbed over at all. 
This is a true testament to the 
amount 
of 
professionalism 

behind each of these actors, 
as 
well 
as 
Runyonland 
Productions 
as 
a 
whole. 
Another vocal talent worthy of 
mention was Kouatchou. All of 
Kouatchou’s vocals were spot 
on — she was perfectly cast for 
her role.
The musical talents of the 
entire cast and orchestra were 
one of the driving forces of 
this production. At times when 
the blocking got a bit muddy 
and the dialogue was not well 
supported, the story was always 
clearly delivered through the 
music. The orchestra and the 
ensemble complimented one 
another well, remaining in 
harmonious balance through 
the 
production. 
Musically, 
there was not a weak member 
of the entire orchestra and cast.
However, while everything 
was technically there, there 
were times when the emotion 
behind the songs was lacking. 
While the technicalities of the 
music are difficult to get right 
in Sondheim, the tragically 
beautiful stories behind the 
songs in “Merrily” are even 
harder to relay to an audience. 
This production of Merrily had 
emotional resonance for most 

of the songs, but some of them 
were lacking in depth.
Yet 
the 
moments 
shared 
between 
Allen, 
Plonk 
and 
Ito seemed to make up for it. 
The chemistry between the 
three actors clearly showed 
each time Allen, Plonk and 
Ito were on stage with one 
another. The relationships of 
these characters are tragically 
flawed and intensely intricate. 
The actors’ portrayal of these 
relationships allowed it to be 
easy for the audience to root 
for a seemingly hard-to-root-
for friendship. This caused the 
last scene of the show, in which 
the three are together for the 
first time, to be particularly 
heartwarming.
When going to the theatre, 
I can always tell that I’ve seen 
a worthwhile production if 
I’ve left the experience feeling 
changed for the better. I left 
“Merrily We Roll Along” with a 
tune in my head and hope in my 
heart, which is something not 
everyone finds on their average 
Friday evening. I look forward 
to 
Runyonland 
Productions’ 
future shows, especially if they 
are anything like “Merrily We 
Roll Along.”

“Climax,” 
Gasper 
Noé’s 
latest film venture, is designed 
to push its audience over the 
edge. 
Everything 
about 
it, 
from the plot to the music to 
the cinematography, is beyond 
disturbing. And I absolutely 
loved it.
The film tells the supposedly 
true story of a group of dancers 
in ’90s France that 
undergoes 
a 
night 
of sex, violence and 
chaos as a result of 
drinking 
LSD-laced 
sangria. 
Because 
the 
perpetrator 
of 
this 
drugging 
isn’t 
revealed 
until 
the 
final shot of the film, 
the audience is just 
as lost and confused 
as the dancers are. 
While 
the 
premise 
of 
“Climax” 
alone 
has the potential to 
be presented in an 
absurdist 
or 
even 
comedic light, Noé 
takes 
the 
exact 
opposite route. He makes it 
dark, repulsive and deeply 
depressing.
“Climax” is one of the most 
immersive movie experiences 
I’ve ever had, mainly due to 
Noé’s 
masterful 
command 
of the technical aspects of 
filmmaking. 
As 
the 
night 
progresses and the drugs begin 
to take effect, the camerawork 

faces a gradual decline in 
clarity and precision. As the 
dancers 
become 
sloppy 
in 
their judgement and cognition, 
the camera becomes sloppy 
as well, shaking and going in 
and out of focus at random 
moments. While we as an 
audience are never able to fully 
grasp what the dancers are 
experiencing, the movements 
of the camera do an excellent 
job of mimicking it. The sounds 
in the movie also function 

to immerse viewers in the 
world of “Climax.” At certain 
points in the film, the bass of 
the music was so loud that I 
could feel my heart adjusting 
to pump along with it. Just 
as the dancers lost control of 
their bodies, I felt I was losing 
control over mine, albeit in an 
admittedly much less severe 
manner.

The film continues to disturb 
its viewers through its plot on 
a deep, psychological level. 
“Climax” purposely seeks to 
confront and exploit our most 
innately human repulsions and 
fears. The film tackles topics 
like incest and self-harm, and 
even threatens the lives of a 
child and a pregnant woman. 
“Climax” clearly understands 
the things that scare us not 
only in general, but on an 
evolutionary, primal level, and 
it takes no issue in 
exploiting them to the 
absolute extreme.
I’m not sure if I’ll 
ever 
see 
“Climax” 
again. I’m not sure if I 
even want to. But I’m 
certainly glad I saw 
it, if only for the fact 
that I’ve never seen 
anything like it, and 
probably never will 
again. Many will say 
that “Climax” goes too 
far in all respects, and 
I wouldn’t disagree 
with them. But there’s 
something to be said 
about a movie that 
can conjure up such 
extreme reactions from its 
audience, even if said reactions 
arise out of shock and disgust. 
“Climax” is a prime example 
of what film as a medium is 
capable of: Harnessing the 
power of sight and sound to 
make us feel something, no 
matter 
how 
unpleasant 
it 
may be. And that, I think, is 
something to be celebrated.

NEW MEDIA NOTEBOOK

NINTENDO

I often joke when I’m going 
through a rough patch that 
upcoming Nintendo releases 
are the only thing keeping 
me going. Yeah sure — there’s 
plenty of music, movies and 
life, I guess, that make the 
daily slog worth it, but what if I 
never got to play “Super Smash 
Bros. Ultimate”? That was the 
light at the end of the tunnel 
that was last fall semester, 
much like the wait for “The 
Legend of Zelda: Breath of 
the Wild” kept me grounded 
senior year of high school. If 
a new “Animal Crossing” or 
“Kirby” game is announced, I 
whisper to myself, “goddamn 
it, they’ve done it again.” The 
next handful of months or even 
years will have the promise of 
(insert new Nintendo game) 
forever tucked away in the 
back of my mind. It’s the carrot 
on a never-extending stick.
So 
when 
“Pokémon Sword” 
and 
“Pokémon 
Shield” 
were 
announced 
a 
few 
weeks 
ago, 
I 
swore 
silently 
under my breath. 
The 
nondescript 
release 
date 
of 
Late 
2019 
can’t 
come soon enough. 
And 
despite 
my 
doubts about Game 
Freak 
making 
a 
main 
series 
“Pokémon” 
game 
for a home video 
game console, the 
proverbial 
hype 
train has left the 
station. 
I 
have 
made it abundantly 
clear to my friends 
and Twitter that I 
would die for that 
monkey.
During 
our 
spring break road 
trip my girlfriend 
and I spent a good 
chunk 
of 
time 
discussing “Sword” 
and 
“Shield” 
speculations 
and 
theories. 
In 
the 
excitement of the 
announcement, 
I 
even 
bought 
“Pokémon 
Ultra 
Sun” to play on 
the trip to scratch 
the itch. I haven’t 
gotten that far, but 
something 
about 
starting 
a 
new 
game 
makes 
me 
fall in love with 
the series all over 
again. The debate 
over which starter 
to choose was as 
back-and-forth 
as it was when 
I booted up my 
first 
“Pokémon” 
game more than 
a decade ago. My 
Safari app is now 
overpopulated 
with 
Bulbapedia 
tabs 
about 
the 
Alola region.
But what makes 
“Pokémon” 
the 
Nintendo 
series 
dearest 
to 
my 

heart, more so than sprawling 
odyssey of a “Zelda” game or 
the platforming precision of a 
“Mario” game?
For years I had just accepted 
video games as a man’s realm, 
to be played and enjoyed and 
talked about at recess fields by 
boys and boys only. The rare 
girl who played video games 
was essentially one of the boys. 
When my parents gave my sister 
and me a Wii for Christmas, I 
was the one who spent hours 
glued to the thing, my sister 
only occasionally stopping by 
for a round of dog frisbee on 
“Wii Sports Resort.” Yes, this 
notion of gendering activities 
is extremely backwards, and I 
resent myself for buying into 
it for so many years, but this is 
what I grew up thinking. Video 
games were a boy’s space.
So why did I always feel 
an 
unexplained 
connection 
with 
female 
video 
game 
characters? Why did I always 
pick Rosalina, Toadette or 
the pink Shy Guy in “Mario 
Kart”? The easy explanation 
to which I chalked it down was 
one offered by a YouTuber I 
used to watch: He reasoned 
to his group of friends that he 
created a female character in 
“Grand Theft Auto V Online” 
because he would rather look 
at a girl than a dude for the 
truckload of hours he would 
pour into the game. Sound 
enough reasoning for 13-year-
old me, who still subscribed 
to the gender binary and had 
never met a queer person in her 
life!
Still, 
even 
then 
this 
explanation 
was 
not 
comforting. Even though I 
always chose or created a 
female player character when I 
was given the option, I would 
never want to be seen playing 
that game because I was afraid 
someone would make fun of me 
or ask why I was playing as a 
girl. It’s a bit sad to think now, 
but this virtual shame was 
perhaps the first manifestation 
of my transgender identity.
And that’s why I found such 
refuge in “Pokémon.” Each 
of the core games was made 
for handhelds (the Game Boy 
Advance, for example) and 
offered me my own private little 
adventure, not displayed to my 
family on the living room TV, 
only shown to those I wanted 
to show — pocket monsters on 
my pocket console. My first 
“Pokémon” generation was the 
fourth, and oh, was it vital. 
“Diamond,” I sing my song of 
love to thee. There’s a common 
phrase found in the openings 
of all the earlier “Pokémon” 
games which is essentially 
the character select screen: 
“Are you a boy? Or are you a 
girl?” The girl in “Diamond” 
is canonically named Dawn, 
whose flowing scarf and pink 
aesthetic I immediately found 
the perfect projection of my 
inward self.
I’d still get teased whenever 
I battled or traded with my 
school friends and they saw a 
pixelated girl pop up on their 
DS screen, but from “Diamond” 
onward I always responded 
“Girl” to the given generation’s 
Professor when they asked. 
And while “Pokémon” isn’t 
explicitly 
a 
queer 
friendly 
game, it has never condemned 

the legions of queer fans whose 
experience with “Pokémon” 
is whatever they make of it. It 
didn’t matter if it was Hoenn 
or Unova; every NPC would 
always refer to me as my 
chosen name (Emily initially 
made the rounds) and gender 
me correctly. Hell, that’s better 
than the real world — their 
batting average is way lower 
than 
“Pokémon”’s 
perfect 
record.
It wasn’t until the sixth 
generation of “Pokémon” that I 
started to realize my constant 
choosing of female protagonists 
was more than an aesthetic 
decision. 
With 
“Pokémon 
Y” Game Freak introduced 
player customization, and I 
was ecstatic. My character 
could actually wear multiple 
cute dresses as opposed to the 
real me who could only dream 
when online window shopping. 
“Y” was also the first time I 
tapped C-a-s-s-i-e into the 
touch screen keyboard. With 
these two aspects however, 
my shame playing as a girl 
grew even greater. I constantly 
played the game with my 3DS 
gripped tight close to my chest.
It’s a bit of a coincidence 
too that the sixth generation 
had two of the most explicit 
references to trans identity. 
Well, not references exactly, 
more 
coincidences 
really, 
but the beauty of “Pokémon” 
is that I can believe them 
to 
be 
references 
and 
not 
immediately be told I’m wrong. 
And plus, at least some one at 
Game Freak has to be down 
for the cause. First, we have 
Sylveon, a Fairy-type evolution 
of first generation pokémon 
Eevee, whose colors match the 
colors of the trans flag to the 
T, and has become the icon for 
trans gamers across the globe 
to trojan horse their transness 
through phone wallpapers and 
Redbubble stickers.
And second, how could we 
forget the benevolent Beauty 
Nova, a female NPC trainer with 
a bit of dialogue mentioning 
she was a “Black Belt” (a 
hulking Karate expert class 
of trainer) “a mere half year 
ago.” Beauty Nova’s dialogue 
opened itself to debate, with 
some fans insisting it was 
just a mistranslation from the 
original Japanese. Personally, 
I’ll have whatever estrogen 
she’s having.
I’ll say it again: “Pokémon” 
is what you make of it. For me, 
not only is each “Pokémon” 
game an incredible journey 
where I lovingly watch these 
weird little creatures evolve 
into a super effective Elite 
Four-squashing squad, but it 
was the first space where I 
could truly be myself without 
obstruction.
In the Photos app on my 
phone 
there 
is 
an 
album 
called “fairy type trash” full 
of selfies and trans memes, 
inspired by our trans icons 
Sylveon and Gen VII starter 
Popplio (I mean, just look at 
her evolutionary line). The 
album primarily exists as a 
timeline to visualize my own 
progress, my own evolution, 
but instead of Exp. Points and 
Rare Candies all it takes is a 
little bit of hormones and a 
lot of confident, unapologetic 
pride in the girl I truly am.

The Widow

Episodes One through Four

Amazon Prime Video

TV REVIEW

AMAZON PRIME VIDEO

In an age where captivating, 
thrilling TV has somehow become 
dime a dozen, “The Widow” offers 
little of note to make it stand out in 
this crowded field. “The Widow” 
features legendary actress Kate 
Beckinsale (“Farming”) making 
her debut as a lead for a TV series, 
but is let down by pretty much 
everything.
Beckinsale plays Georgia, a 
widow who lost her husband in 
a plane crash in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo a few years 
ago. However, while catching an 
off-hand news update at a hospital 
after a minor injury, she notices 
someone who looks suspiciously 
like her presumed-dead husband. 
A little too suspiciously like 
her presumed-dead husband. 
Intrigued, she travels off to the 
Congo to investigate further, 
becoming entangled in a web of 
individuals including the husband 
of the accused bomber who bought 
the plane down. Other characters 
are brought in and out, mostly to 
explain the plane crash mystery 
(even Charles Dance (“Game of 
Thrones”) is roped in as pretty 
much just a guy with an epic voice).
“The 
Widow” 
frequently 

switches back and forth in time, 
and while that in and of itself isn’t 
necessarily distracting, the writers 
don’t quite pull off the timeline 
shifts well enough to prevent 
the multitude of storylines from 
blurring together. Moreover, the 
pacing and storytelling suffers, 
going much slower than it could 
have gone. Entire sequences could 
have been stitched together instead 
of constantly switching back and 

forth, creating a disorienting effect.
Beckinsale and most of the cast 
deliver at minimum satisfactory 
performances. Even the dialogue 
isn’t terrible, but the storytelling 
is what detracts from all of it. Even 
a couple episodes in, viewers are 
unlikely to develop an emotional 
attachment to any of the characters, 
even those with more intriguing 

storylines. Moreover, the DRC is 
little more than an exotic prop, 
with 
annoyingly 
paternalistic 
undertones 
permeating 
several 
scenes. A few characters are given 
a semblance of a backstory. Some 
even give some social commentary 
about their country’s history and 
the havoc colonialism has wreaked 
on it. However, in a cruel twist of 
irony just like real life, their words 
are largely ignored in favor of the 
“main story.”
Tension is never really built 
in a meaningful way until 
the end of each episode. But 
given the continuous manner 
in which many viewers of the 
show will watch it, even those 
cliff-hangers aren’t all that 
satisfying. The writers bury and 
stomp any semblance of “show 
not tell,” with exposition taking 
up too many scenes. Georgia’s 
relationship with her husband is 
as generic Hallmark show as you 
can get, and her massive quest is 
never given more than a superficial 
raison-d’être.
All in all, the question I kept 
asking myself throughout the 
first few episodes was “why…..?” 
Why should I care about these 
characters? Why aren’t the people 
of the country the show is set 
in given any depth? Why am I 
watching this?

‘The Widow’ is a thriller 
with hardly any thrills

Breaking down Michigan’s key players from the 2018-19 campaign

Two-thirds of the ways through 
the season, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team looked doomed 
for mediocrity. But the Wolverines 
completely turned things around, 
winning nine of their final 11 
games. 
Starting with a Feb. 1 victory 
over 
No. 
10 
Iowa, 
Michigan 
powered its way 
through the Big 
Ten 
to 
secure 
fourth place in 
the 
conference 
standings — its 
second-best finish 
in 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico’s seven-year 
tenure as coach. 
Guided by their 
star co-captain seniors, guard 
Nicole Munger and center Hallie 
Thome, and a pair of standout 
freshmen in guard Amy Dilk 
and forward Naz Hillmon, the 
Wolverines are now on the cusp 
of their second-straight NCAA 

Tournament berth. 
The Daily breaks down the 
seasons these four players put 
together. 
Amy Dilk
Possibly no freshman in the 
country came into the season 
with larger shoes to fill than 
Dilk. Slotted into the point guard 
position from day one, Dilk had 
to replace Michigan’s all-time 
leading 
scorer, 
Katelynn 
Flaherty.
While Dilk may 
not have been the 
Wolverines’ most 
consistent player, 
no game proved 
her worth more 
than 
Michigan’s 
Nov. 
25 
affair 
with Washington. 
In just her sixth 
collegiate game, Dilk registered 
a stat line of 19 points, nine 
rebounds and seven assists in an 
80-73 victory. 
Oftentimes 
throughout 
the season, Dilk struggled to 
consistently score. But Barnes 

Arico overlooked her struggles 
and realized the importance of 
having Dilk on the court. When 
Dilk was out with a knee injury for 
three games, Barnes Arico noticed 
a difference in her team and a 
slight increase in sloppy play. 
“Amy was probably averaging 
about 35 minutes a game and 
she had the ball in her hands, 
especially 
under 
pressure,” 
Barnes Arico said 
after a Feb. 14 
win over Indiana 
in 
which 
her 
team committed 
20 turnovers. “A 
lot 
of 
decision 
making 
came 
through her.”
Barnes 
Arico 
has 
consistently 
praised 
Dilk’s 
high 
basketball 
IQ and said she would not have 
preferred anyone else run the 
point position this season. 
Naz Hillmon
Big Ten Sixth Player of the 
Year, Big Ten media selection for 
Freshman of the Year, Big Ten 

All-Freshman Team and First 
Team All-Big Ten. These are the 
accolades that Hillmon can claim 
with the regular season now in the 
books. 
Despite not starting a game, 
Hillmon led the Wolverines in 
field goal percentage (.626), points 
per game (13.2), rebounds per 
game (6.9) and tied for second on 
the team in steals (31). 
She has dazzled 
in 
competition 
all season. In her 
first four games, 
the 
freshman 
forward shot an 
absurd 
26-for-
31 while scoring 
more 
than 
20 
points 
in 
two 
of those games. 
Since 
then, 
it 
has been much 
of the same for Hillmon, whose 
motor leads the Wolverines’ press 
defense. 
“(Hillmon’s) 
energy 
is 
contagious,” Barnes Arico said 
after Hillmon’s 22 points and 
eight rebounds against Detroit-

Mercy. “I think she just does a 
tremendous job of bringing it each 
and every single day. I think it’s 
definitely a difference-maker in 
our program’s success, so it’s great 
to have her.”
Hallie Thome
Coming into the season, Thome 
was expected to 
be the offensive 
leader 
of 
the 
team. And while 
a nagging back 
injury 
may 
have caused the 
senior center to 
have 
lackluster 
performances at 
Penn State and 
Michigan State, 
she put together 
a 
season 
to 
remember.
Averaging 
12.5 
points, 
6.1 
rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game, 
Thome earned First Team All-
Big Ten honors — selected by the 
Big Ten coaches — for the third 
consecutive season. Along the 
way, Thome recorded her 2,000th 
career point and positioned herself 
in second place on the Michigan 
all-time leading scorers list. 
“2,000 points is a lot of points,” 
Barnes Arico said on WTKA on 
Feb. 19. “It means from the minute 
she stepped on campus, she has 
made an immediate impact on our 
program. She’s been such a special 
player for us. A 6-foot-5 kid that 
can really do anything. 
“I mean she has such great soft 
hands, able to catch any pass you 
throw up, finishes 
well 
around 
the rim, ability 
to 
offensively 
rebound the ball 
and just has a 
great touch and a 
great feel for the 
game.”
Nicole Munger
Seen 
as 
the 
leader 
of 
the 
Wolverines, 
Munger saved her best for her 
final season at Michigan. Earning 
Third Team All-Big Ten honors 
for the first time in her career, 
the senior averaged 9.9 points 
per game, good for third on the 
team, and shot the second-highest 

three-point percentage on the 
team (.345) despite taking nearly 
40 percent of the team’s three-
point attempts (168). 
But what Munger brought to 
the table this season went well 
beyond the stat sheet. Take the 
Wolverines’ Feb. 14 matchup with 
Indiana. With 30 
seconds 
on 
the 
clock and a five-
point lead, Munger 
took a charge — 
despite 
having 
four fouls — to give 
the ball back to 
Michigan and seal 
the game. 
Or how about 
on Jan. 24, also 
against 
the 
Hoosiers? Munger 
went flying into the band trying 
to save a loose ball, walking away 
with a giant bruise on her leg from 
diving into a tuba.
Munger provided an endless 
supply of these high-intensity 
moments throughout the season, 
and that’s what Barnes Arico 
loves the most about her senior 
co-captain. 
“(Munger’s) just a special kid,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I think she’s 
been the heart and soul of our 
team since the minute she walked 
on campus. … She’s a tremendous 
basketball player but she’s even a 
better person.” 
With 
only 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 
remaining, 
Dilk, 
Hillmon, Thome and Munger 
hope to lead Michigan past the 
first 
weekend 
for 
the 
first 
time in program 
history. 
Luckily 
for them, they’ll 
have help from 
sophomore guard 
Deja 
Church, 
sophomore 
forward 
Hailey 
Brown, 
junior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson 
and 
junior forward Kayla Robbins who 
have all had clutch performances 
throughout the season.
But now the burden is on 
Michigan’s four stars to continue 
their strong regular seasons into 
March and deliver.

Wolverines knock off No. 2 UCLA 
but go 1-2 at Dodgertown Classic

After four hours of action, the 
No. 16 Michigan baseball team 
(9-4) was looking to stay alive in 
the bottom of the tenth inning 
on Sunday at Dodger Stadium. 
Freshman right-hander Willie 
Weiss had given up a bases-
loaded walk to put Oklahoma 
State up, 3-2, in the top of the 
inning, and it was now up to the 
bottom of the Wolverines’ order 
to keep the game alive.
All three batters struck out 
swinging.
“(Weiss) had the one tough 
inning, a couple of hits fall, 
you don’t get a couple of calls 
and end up with some walks, 
that happens,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “It was just 
magnified because it was the 
tenth inning, but I thought the 
numbers didn’t tell the whole 
story because he made some 
gutsy pitches in some huge 
spots.”
The extra-inning loss proved 
to 
exemplify 
Michigan’s 
performance over the weekend. 
An impressive outing by the 
starting pitchers — all three 
gave up just two earned runs — 
and error-free defense kept the 
Wolverines in the games despite 
a struggling offense scoring two 
runs on Saturday and one run on 
Sunday, dropping two of three 
games to USC and Oklahoma 
State while beating No. 2 UCLA.
“We 
certainly 
had 
opportunities to execute on this 
trip that we didn’t get done,” 
Bakich said. “Whether it was 
getting bunts down or moving 
runners over, and those are the 
things that need repetition. Those 
are the things that we haven’t 
been able to do in training. We 
need to work on those areas, we 
had a lot of outs on the bases from 
this trip, whether it be caught 
stealing or pick-offs. Those are 
very costly mistakes against 

really good teams.”
This 
past 
weekend’s 
competition was against some of 
their toughest competition this 
year and proved to be a big test 
for Michigan early in the season. 
With four runs in the first inning, 
the Wolverines got off to a quick 
start on Friday against the Bruins 
and never looked back on their 
way to a 7-5 upset victory.
Saturday, 
though, 
Michigan’s 
offense 
stagnated. 
Scoring 
one 
unearned run in 
the sixth inning, 
the 
Wolverines 
fell to USC, 4-1. 
Sunday, 
the 
offense 
scored 
just 
two 
runs 
against the Cowboys, both batted 
in 
by 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Jordan Nwogu, who had a great 
individual performance with an 
RBI single and a solo home run in 
the 10-inning loss.
“Players are just out of their 
routine,” Bakich said. “They just 
aren’t getting the drill work in 
they normally get. The hitters 
aren’t hitting off the tee and 
getting their cage routine in. It’s 
just you show up to the games, 
you do batting practice and you 
get as much as you can in those 
opportunities.”
After the weekend series, 
just two players have a batting 
average over .300, and the team 
went 2-for-10 with runners in 
scoring position in the two losses 
this weekend.
Junior 
left-hander 
Tommy 
Henry gained his fourth win of 
the season against the Bruins, 
even though he gave up his 
first runs of the year. The other 
weekend starters had similar 
performances, 
keeping 
the 
Wolverines in the game. Junior 
right-hander Karl Kauffmann 
allowed just two runs against 

USC on Saturday and sophomore 
right-hander Jeff Criswell also 
gave up two runs to the Cowboys, 
striking out 12.
“We’ve been very fortunate to 
get the starting pitching we’ve 
gotten from Tommy Henry, Karl 
Kauffmann and Jeff Criswell,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“They’ve 
been 
workhorses thus far, especially 
Tommy and Karl.”
Having 
won 
one of their last 
five, 
Michigan 
has work to do.
“It was a let 
down 
against 
USC 
and 
it 
was a let down 
(Sunday),” 
Bakich 
said. 
“The only thing 
you 
can 
do 
when it feels like 
there’s a let down is learn from 
it, grow from it, get better from 
it. So that’s what we want to do. 
We want to find ways to keep 
improving as the season keeps 
going.”

Mixed bag for ‘M’ relief pitching

On Saturday, the No. 16 
Michigan baseball team was 
locked into a defensive battle 
with 
Southern 
California. 
Through seven innings, junior 
right-hander 
Karl 
Kauffman 
allowed two runs while the 
Wolverines faced a one-run 
deficit. But in the next inning, 
relief pitchers sophomore left-
hander Angelo Smith and junior 
right-hander Jack Weisenburger 
allowed two runs adding to the 
deficit.
In 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
eighth, Smith walked the first 
batter, Chase Bushor, on four 
consecutive 
pitches. 
Bushor 
then advanced to second base 
after a wild pitch. Four pitches 
later, Matthew Acosta singled 
up the middle, sending Bushor to 
third. At this moment, Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich saw fit to 
make another change, and Smith 
was replaced by Weisenburger.
Weisenberger was unable to 
stop the bleeding as the Trojans 
would score two additional runs 
off a sacrifice fly and another 

single to put the game to bed, 4-1.
“The relievers, it’s just who we 
feel good about in that situation 
against the opposing hitters 
that are coming up that have 
the best chance to put a zero up 
and get quick outs for us,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“And most of the time, it’s like 
any baseball game. You feel good 
about it going in, but sometimes, 
you don’t always get the call, or a 
guy bloops one in or a pitch isn’t 
executed or whatever happens 
happens.”
In a 3-2 loss to Oklahoma 
State on Sunday, Bakich got the 
call right as the relievers gave up 
just a single run.
Michigan’s traditional pillars 
of the program have been their 
defense and their pitching. Thus 
far this season, their hitting has 
been a pleasant surprise.
But, 
at 
the 
Dodgertown 
Classic, the relief pitching was 
a mixed bag and the bats fell 
flat. The Wolverines have lost 
four out of their last five on the 
West Coast, and the increased 
competition is a good measuring 
stick 
for 
Michigan 
against 
warmer-climate 
teams 
with 

more repetitions under their 
belt.
The relief pitching was solid 
Friday against UCLA with the 
exception of an outfield mistake 
that led to runs. Freshman right-
hander Willie Weiss came in 
for junior left-hander Tommy 
Henry in the bottom of the 
seventh and was looking to close 
out the game up 6-2. Weiss got 
two outs, but had the bases were 
loaded before a misplayed ball 
in the outfield led to a bases-
clearing triple for the Bruins. 
But this didn’t faze Weiss as he 
bounced back with consecutive 
1-2-3 innings to close out the 
win.
“The relief pitching we got on 
Friday from Willie Weiss was 
really good,” Bakich said. “He 
got three outs and we dropped 
a pop-up in foul territory and as 
kinda what happens when you 
give good teams extra chances, 
they make you pay for it. Then 
the guy hit the bases-clearing 
triple but he actually (went 
through) that particular inning 
unscathed.
“I thought a huge moment in 
that game was where he showed 
some pretty good poise for a 
freshman after giving up three 
runs and having a really tough 
inning to come back pitch the 
eighth and the ninth scoreless. 
Put up zeros against an excellent 
UCLA team, maybe the best 
team in the country, so the relief 
pitching was good there.”
Relief pitching is a delicate 
mechanism, and the season 
is still in its infancy. But this 
facet of baseball can make or 
break teams, and a questionable 
bullpen is not an issue a team 
wants to have when competing 
for championships.
“We have some guys that need 
to mechanically iron out a few 
things,” Bakich said, “Haven’t 
gotten off to a great start but, 
you know, it’s early and there is 
plenty of season left and plenty 
of growth opportunities left for 
everyone, position players and 
pitchers alike.”

Similar mistakes cost Wolverines

Michigan could not stop 
Cassius Winston. Again.
Michigan State stymied the 
Wolverines’ ball-screen game. 
Again.
Michigan blew a second-half 
lead. Again.
The 
difference 
between 
Feb. 24 in Ann Arbor — a 77-70 
Wolverine loss — and three days 
ago in East Lansing? Saturday 
was not only for bragging 
rights but for a conference 
championship.
Michigan lost to Michigan 
State, 75-63, and came away 
with neither. The reasons why 
either had roots stemming from 
the team’s first 
meeting or were 
taken 
directly 
from the game 
two weeks ago.
First 
up: 
Winston — the 
newly-minted 
Big Ten Player 
of the Year — 
who scored 27 
points and eight 
assists 
in 
the 
first meeting while playing 
from tip-off to final buzzer.
Postgame 
Saturday, 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers was asked what the 
Wolverines’ biggest takeaway 
from two weeks prior was. He 
sighed and gave a no-doubter of 
an answer.
“Can’t let Cassius take us 
across the court on a ball-
screen,” Livers said. “He did it 
again and again and again in 
the second half, 
and we had no 
answer for the 
run.”
Michigan 
looked to have 
an answer early 
on. 
Instead 
of 
hedging 
ball-screens 
— 
sending 
junior 
center Jon Teske 
with 
Winston 
on the perimeter to push him 
away from the basket, which 
the Wolverines had done in the 
first meeting — they switched 
them, taking away many of the 
easy assists to a wide-open roll 
man that Winston tallied in 
February.
Junior 
Zavier 
Simpson, 

meanwhile, was his normally 
rugged 
defensive 
self 
once 
again. 
When 
Winston 
and 
Simpson went at it, Michigan’s 
point guard usually won the 
battle. Winston shot just 1-for-
5 with seven points in the first 
half.
But ultimately, Winston was 
too good and too much. As the 
Wolverines bricked their lead 
away, Winston — just as he had 
done two weeks ago — slithered 
around defenders and got to 
the rim with ease in the second 
half. His 23 points and seven 
assists led both categories.
If there’s one person who 
could have stopped Winston, 
or at least prevented him 
from taking total control of 
the game, that 
man was lined 
up across from 
him in a blue 
jersey. Simpson 
couldn’t, for the 
second time in a 
row. There’s no 
shame in that, 
but Simpson — 
who, according 
to 
freshman 
David DeJulius, 
told his team that Winston’s 
performance was his fault — 
certainly felt differently.
“We 
couldn’t 
stop 
him 
from 
turning 
the 
corner,” 
said assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes. “He turned the corner 
at will, anytime he wanted to.”
The Wolverines had no more 
luck scoring off their own 
ball-screens. Michigan State 
coach Tom Izzo’s stroke of 
genius in the first matchup was 
switching every 
screen and cut 
off 
Simpson’s 
dribble 
penetration, 
forcing one-on-
one 
situations. 
With one of its 
offensive staples 
neutralized, 
Michigan 
fell 
apart.
Coming 
into Saturday, the Wolverines 
were optimistic that this time 
would be different. They were 
merely caught off-guard by 
the Spartans’ adjustments, and 
with time to make their own, 
they would put the shoe on 
the other foot. Michigan was 
prepared to attack mismatches 

— such as finding Teske down 
low after a guard switched onto 
him — and show discipline on 
isolations.
The Wolverines did neither. 
Simpson missed 10 of 13 shots, 
including many at the rim. 
Teske took just five shots — 
the same as in February — and 
Michigan stopped trying to feed 
him. The Wolverines’ 15 points 
in the last 14 minutes mirrored 
their slump of nine points in 15 
minutes in the second half of 
the first game.
“I thought we had a really 
good plan the first half,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“The second half, kids just 
aren’t used to (Michigan State’s 
defense). … Just things we gotta 
learn.”
Much 
credit 
belongs 
to 
Michigan 
State, 
especially 
Xavier 
Tillman. 
The 
sophomore 
forward 
showed 
the athleticism to shut down 
guards on the perimeter and the 
explosiveness to lock down the 
paint when the guards got that 
far, finishing with five blocked 
shots. Tillman was a matchup 
nightmare 
the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t wake up from.
Against players like Winston 
and 
Tillman, 
there’s 
only 
so much a team can do. But 
whatever Michigan had the 
chance to do, it was unable 
to — and the product was a 
result earned in a painstakingly 
familiar way.
“We weren’t poised when 
we needed to,” Beilein said. 
“We needed to be poised at that 
time and we weren’t. We didn’t 
show.”
The regular season is over 
now. By the time of their 
first game in the Big Ten 
Tournament, the Wolverines 
will have had five days to 
recover and gear up for a 
new phase of their campaign. 
They’re also likely to receive 
reinforcements, 
as 
redshirt 
junior wing Charles Matthews 
appears 
close 
to 
returning 
from an ankle injury for the 
postseason, where Michigan 
has historically hit its highest 
gear.
But if the Wolverines revert 
to their old tendencies like they 
did Saturday, if they can’t learn 
from their mistakes and apply 
those lessons in time, they’ll 
have a tough time finding that 
level.

Canfield’s bat catches fire out West

The weather may have been 
hot, but Faith Canfield came out 
scorching.
As a Southern California 
native, 
the 
senior 
second 
baseman is used to the heat. 
Temperatures hovered around 
the mid-70s when the No. 25 
Michigan softball team battled 
against some of the nation’s top 
competition at last week’s Judi 
Garman Classic and Arizona 
State Invitational, but no source 
of heat was more intense than 
Canfield’s bat.
The flip of the calendar 
brought 
about 
some 
much-
needed success for Canfield, 
who came into the month with 
a .283 batting average — a figure 
well below her lofty standard. 
Canfield 
posted 
respective 
batting averages of .398 and .391 
in her sophomore and junior 
seasons en route to earning 
All-America honors in each 
campaign.
On Feb. 19, Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins told The Daily 
that she wanted to see Canfield 
“take this team by the horns.”
Despite games against No. 5 
Florida, No. 7 Arizona, and No. 9 
Louisiana State, the Wolverines 
limped into this month without 
a 
signature 
win. 
Much 
of 
their shortcomings paralleled 
Canfield’s efforts to rediscover 
the swing that placed her among 
the nation’s best infielders. After 
14 starts, she entered this month 
with just three multi-hit games, 
four RBIs and zero extra-base 
hits.
But when the new month 
rolled around, Canfield took a 
firm grasp of those horns.
Canfield sparked Michigan’s 
success at the Judi Garman 
Classic on March 1, driving in 
a pair of runs with a go-ahead 
single 
in 
the 
sixth 
inning 
against 
previously-unbeaten 
No. 2 UCLA, which propelled 
the Wolverines to a 3-1 upset 
victory. The win gave the 

team an energy boost, while 
Canfield’s big hit had the exact 
same effect on a personal level.
Two 
days 
later, 
Canfield 
reached base in two of her 
three at-bats in Michigan’s 4-2 
victory over No. 5 Washington. 
Her confidence at the plate gave 
way to success on the basepath, 
as she scored a run and swiped 
a bag in the team’s second upset 
in as many games.
Later 
that 
afternoon, 
Canfield delivered once again. 
This 
time, 
the 
Wolverines 
were deadlocked in a scoreless 
tie against California State-
Northridge in the final inning 
when she stepped up to the 
plate. With junior outfielder 
Haley 
Hoogenraad 
standing 
on second base, Canfield laced 
a double into right field. When 
the dust settled, her walk-off 
heroics lifted the Wolverines to 
an unbeaten weekend after a 7-8 
start.
“(Canfield) is doing her part,” 
Hutchins said. “She’s gone above 
and beyond this past weekend 
and I’m hoping it can inspire us 
and give us some confidence.”
When the team made its way 
south of Canfield’s home state, 
her hot streak continued at 
the Arizona State Invitational. 
She reached base safely in four 
of Michigan’s five games — 
including a pair of three-hit 
efforts in the last two contests 
of the weekend — highlighted 
by a power surge against New 

Mexico State. Canfield recorded 
a pair of doubles and launched 
her first long ball of the season 
in the Wolverines’ 3-0 victory 
over the Aggies.
Between 
the 
two 
tournaments, Canfield posted 13 
hits in 29 at-bats — good for an 
average of .448 — while driving 
in six runs and striking out just 
twice. Less than two weeks 
after sitting on a .283 batting 
average, her clip has ballooned 
to .347.
Though her success on the 
field has helped the Wolverines 
add tallies to their win column, 
it was Canfield’s continued work 
ethic through a cold February 
that struck the most meaningful 
chord to her teammates.
“It’s been great looking to 
(Canfield),” 
said 
freshman 
outfielder Lexie Blair. “She’s 
one of our team captains and 
you really just she that drive in 
her when she plays, and I know 
she has her moments when she’s 
struggling a little bit. Before 
I even came here, I grew up 
watching her over her years in 
Michigan, finally seeing her as 
a senior, seeing her doing her 
thing, being consistent as she is, 
the past couple weekends have 
been amazing and I really look 
up to her, and so do many other 
people.”
If Michigan is to sustain any 
success, Canfield can’t afford 
to loosen her grip on the team’s 
horns.
