SENATE ASSEMBLY
SACUA calls
* for policy on
misconduct

STUDY GAMES

Committee crafts
resolution to
audit reporting
procedure
By KATIE BURKE
Daily Staff Reporter
In the wake of the Universi-
ty of Michigan Health System's
six-month delay in reporting to
police that a former University
Health System resident pos-
sessed child pornography, the
Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs drafted a
resolution yesterday to investi-
gate the University's process of
reporting suspected criminal
activity between professionals
and vulnerable individuals.
The resolution calls for a
University-wide audit of poli-
cies regarding the official pro-
cess of reporting professional
misconduct among doctors,
nurses, social workers and
teachers in their relation-
ships with minors and the
elderly. SACUA also motioned
to include daycare providers
and physical therapists in the
policy.
SACUA member John
Lehman, a professor of ecology

and evolutionary biology, said
the resolution should include
rights to both the informer
and the accused, noting that
reporters should feel confident
in divulging information with-
out consequences and accused
parties should have the right to
defend themselves.
"The policies should safe-
guard the reporter from
retaliation ... (and) ensure
appropriate supervision and
sanctions where necessary
with rights for meaningful
appeal for sanctioned indi-
viduals," Lehman said at the
meeting.
Lehman said victims should
have an opportunity to face the
accused with the assistance
of an advocate, though the
committee expressed concern
about allowing such contact
due to the vulnerability of the
victims.
Instead of direct communi-
cation between the victim and
accused, the committee agreed
to allow for the opportunity of
a fair hearing for the accused.
SACUA member Ed Roth-
man, a professor of statistics,
said the wording of the reso-
lution could deter potential
reporters of criminal activity
from approaching officials.

Fire severely damages Broadway Auto Care

Cause of blaze
unknown, no

crews from all five of the city's
stations responded shortly
after 6:30 p.m. after a fire broke
out at Broadway Auto Care at
1026 Broadway Street, near the
University's Kellogg Eye Cen-
ter.
In an interview at the scene

of the fire, Assistant Fire Chief
Steven Lowe said AAFD fire-
fighters were able to extinguish
the blaze before it spread to
other buildings. There were
no injuries reported by either
employees or firefighters
and the cause was unknown,
according to Lowe.
Ann Arbor Police officers
blocked eastbound traffic on
Broadway Street from Maiden
Lane to the junction of North
Division Street and Beakes
Street. Two ambulances were
also on scene.
According to Lowe, AAFD
received a call from bystanders

who witnessed the fire. When
crews arrived, Lowe said they
witnessed "heavy fire" coming
from two of the shop's three
repair bays, as flames crawled
up the back of the store and the
windows.
DTE Energy employees also
shut off the store's natural gas
and electric lines. Lowe said
the utilities were turned off to
prevent further harm to the
building or responding fire-
fighters.
Once visible fires were extin-
guished, firefighters punctured
the building's walls to ensure
that no flames remained. The

building suffered serious dam-
age and three cars that were
located inside the bays at the
time of the fire appear to be
destroyed.
Lowe said the AAFD will be
investigating the cause of the
fire.
"One of our fire investiga-
tors will follow up with an
investigation to try to pinpoint
what exactly happened," Lowe
said.
Store employees declined to
comment about the fire.

Russian police officers detain protester aftera rally in Moscow yesterday. Riot police broke up an opposition protest con-
testing Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's victory in Russia's presidential election, arresting dozens of participants.
Ro police break u protests
after controversial elections

About 250 people
detained after a
rally in Moscow
MOSCOW (AP) - An attempt
by Vladimir Putin's foes toprotest
his presidential election victory
by occupying a Moscow square
ended yesterday with riot police
quickly dispersing and detaining
hundreds of demonstrators - a
stark reminder of the challenges
faced by Russia's opposition.
The harsh crackdown could
fuel opposition anger and bring
even bigger protests of Putin's
12 years in power and election to
another six, but it also underlined
the authorities' readiness to use
force to crush such demonstra-
tions.
The rally marked a change of
tactics for the opposition, which
has been looking for ways to main-
tain the momentum of its demon-
strations that flared in December.
Alexei Navalny, a popular blogger
and one of the most charismatic
protest leaders, was the first to
suggest that supporters remain on
Moscow's streets and squares to
turn up the heat on Putin.
For Putin, the opposition move
raised the specter of the 2004

Orange Revolution in Ukraine,
where demonstrators camped on
Kiev's main square in massive
protests that forced officials to
throw out a fraud-tainted election
victory by the Kremlin-backed
candidate.
The government's response
last night was fast and brutal.
Lines of officers in full riot gear
marched into tree-lined Pushkin
Square and forced protesters into
waiting police buses. About 250
people were detained around the
city, police said.
The crackdown followed a
rally that drew about 20,000 peo-
ple angry over an election cam-
paign slanted in Putin's favor and
reports of widespread violations
in Sunday's voting.
Putin commands the loyalty
of police and the military, whose
wages were recently doubled. Fol-
lowing yesterday's massive show
of force, the urban middle-class
forming the core of the protests
could be more reluctant to attend
future demonstrations.
Navalny - who sought to elec-
trify the crowd with a passionate
call of "We are the power!" - was
among those detained, along with
opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov.
Both were released from police
custody a few hours later.

"We are calling for peace-
ful action of civil disobedience,
and we shall not leave," Navalny
shouted to the crowd. "We know
the truth about this government.
This is the government of crooks
and thieves."
Upon his release from police
custody, Navalny told 30-40 sup-
porters who greeted him that
another protest was planned for
Saturday in Moscow and other
cities.
"We will keep on fighting until
we win," he said.
Putin, who was president from
2000-08 and is the current prime
minister, won more than 63 per-
cent of the vote, according to the
nearly complete official returns,
but the opposition alleged mas-
sive ballot fraud. Communist
Party candidate Gennady Zyu-
ganov finished a distant second
with 17 percent.
"The campaign has been unfair,
cowardly and treacherous," said
opposition leader Grigory Yavlin-
sky, who was denied registration
for the race on a technicality.
International election moni-
tors pointed to the lack of real
competition and said the vote
count "was assessed negatively"
in almost a third of polling sta-
tions that observers visited.

Nearly every home
destroyed in last
week's twister
MARYSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -
This tiny Indiana farm town has
no mayor, no school and no shop-
ping center. And after last week's
deadly tornadoes, it has virtually
nowhere left to live..
Nearly every home in Marys-
ville was destroyed or so badly
damaged it will probably have
to be torn down - a realization
that raised an emotional ques-
tion for people still gathering
belongings from the debris: Is it
worth rebuilding a place that has
so little?
In some of the tiny commu-
nities smashed by the violent
weather, the idea hangs in the air,
raising doubts even among fami-
lies who have lived in the same
place for generations.
Before it was erased by the
storm, Marysville had been a hub
of farming activity in deep south-
ern Indiana since the mid-1800s,
with many sons working the
same rows of corn and soybeans
as their grandparents.
But as they surveyed the dev-
astation, some townspeople
concluded it would be easier to
abandon the village and look for
work in Louisville, Ky., 30 miles
to the south.
"I think this community is
pretty much gone. I don't think
anyone will rebuild. A lot of
people had no insurance," Scott
Meadors said Sunday as he
salvaged belongings from the
storm's aftermath.
When a bigger population cen-
ter such as Joplin, Mo., is crip-
pled by tornadoes, there is rarely
any question about rebuilding.
Larger cities typically have
greater resources and defined
downtowns to serve as focal
points. But this flyspeck village

may have suffered a mortal blow.
Sean Gilbert says there's noth-
ing to do but move away. He
doubts little if anything will be
rebuilt in Marysville, a town of
a few hundred inhabitants that
was struggling economically
even before Friday's storms,
which killed 40 people in five
states.
"It's a shock,"he said, standing
beside his family's 150-year-old
home, which had its siding torn
away, great gashes in its roof, a
caved-in front porch and metal
shutters creaking eerily in the
wind. The twister also destroyed
the chicken house, tossed a com-
bine on its side and tore two
enormous grain silos to pieces.
One house was ground into
a mound of bricks, glass and
wood.
The winds also scattered
farmequipment like bits of saw-
dust across miles of surround-
ing countryside. Cars were
lifted and slammed back to the
ground in clumps of colorful
crushed metal. A semi-trailer
was kicked into a tree as if it
were a toy.
Marysville's younger people
started to drift away from the
town some time ago, pushed by
tough economic times to com-
mute to jobs closer to Louis-
ville. The devastation leftby the
tornado now threatens to drive
them off for good.
Gilbert, who works at a res-
taurant in the Louisville suburb
of New Albany, is staying with a
brother who already lives there.
He's planning to move there
permanently, though his par-
ents are intent on staying.
"The younger generation ...
they don't have as long a footing
here and are more apt to move,"
he said. "It's a sad thing to see
them move away."
Gilbert's grandfather arrived
in the Marysville area from
Kentucky in the mid-20th cen-

tury, stepping from a boxcar
along with his family and a
small herd of livestock in search
of a bigger farm and a better life.
"It used to be a real pretty
town," said Shannon Steele as
he waded into the debris around
his mother's flattened home and
tenderly collected a handful of
colorful broaches and other jew-
elry. "I don't really see a lot of
people rebuilding."
Steele has lived in Marysville
since he was 5, back when there
was still a two-room school-
house and a set of tracks on the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
line. As trains passed, a conduc-
tor would hurl a bag of mail to
Steele's grandmother, who was
once the postmaster.
Now the rail line is closed
and the school is a community
center, though the storm left it
without a roof. The post office
and a hardware store built in
1900 are still around, and the
only other business is a tiny used
car lot. Long gone is the saw mill
- later a canning factory - and
the general store.
Longtime residents spoke
of their childhoods in loving
terms, remembering the basket-
ball games, birthday parties and
barbecues.
"It was serene, like a Nor-
mal Rockwell painting," Bruce
Bridgewater said.
The government of surround-
ing Clark County planned to
help with debris removal and
the restoration of infrastructure
and utilities.
"Our hope is it doesn't just
become a name on a map," said
county Commissioner John Per-
kins. "We would hope that what
was destroyed - and that's most
of it - can be rebuilt."
Beyond that, the village's sur-
vival could depend onhow much
federal and state assistance
trickles down to local communi-
ties.

An Oakland County woman
says she's become a prisoner on

Edna Geisler calls the foul bird
"Godzilla." The 69-year-old told
the Detroit Free Press thatcthe tur-
key wanders near her Commerce

LANSING
State debuts toll-
free abuse hotline
A new call-in system for report-
ingabuse and neglect debutedyes-
terday in Michigan, another step
toward compliance with a court-
ordered mandate for the state to
improve conditions for children
needing protective services.
The new system establishes a
single phone number statewide for
reporting abuse or neglect related
to children and adults. The num-
ber will be staffed around-the-
clock, including weekends and
holidays. Decisions on whether
to investigate a child abuse case
are expected to be made on the
spot, no matter what time of day
or night, before being directly
referred to county-level child pro-
tective services staff.
The statewide complaint intake
system will be based in Kent
County, where a six-county pilot
program testing the system has
run since September. The state-
wide system replaces one where
calls were made to individual
Department of Human Services
county-level offices, which some-
times led to inconsistent results.

Amoderatelystrongearthquake
cracked buildings and knocked
televisions and glassware from

Renato Solidum of the Philip-

tered just two miles (three kilo-
meters) north of Masbate City on
the island province of Masbate.
The quake, which was caused

UNITED NATIONS

U.N. says disasters
last year were most
* costly on record
The economic cost of disasters
in 2011 was the highest in history
- with a pricetag of at least $380
billion, mainly due to earthquakes
in Japan and New Zealand, a U.N.
envoy said yesterday.
Margareta Wahlstrom, the sec-
retary-general's special represen-
tative for disaster risk reduction,
said the figure was two-thirds
higher than the previous record
in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina
struck the southern United States.
In addition to the earthquakes,
Wahlstrom said major floods in
Thailand and other countries
caused extensive damage.
"The main message is that this
is an increasing - very rapidly
increasing trend with increasing
economic losses," Wahlstrom said.
"But the economics of disasters
is becoming a major threat to a
number of countries," Wahlstrom
said.

Amir Hekmati, 28,
was sentenced to
death in January
TEHRAN, Iran- Iran's
Supreme Court has ordered
the retrial of an ex-U.S. Marine
who was sentenced to death
on charges of working for the
CIA, a news agency reported
yesterday.
The case has added even more
tension to U.S.-Iran relations,
as Washington and its allies
press ahead with sanctions
over Iran's contentious nuclear
development program, and Iran
threatens punishing retaliation
if it is attacked.
Amir Hekmati, 28, was
sentenced to death in January,
the first American to receive
a death penalty since the 1979
Islamic Revolution in Iran.
Hekmati was born in Arizona.
His parents are of Iranian origin.
Iran accuses Hekmati of
receiving special training
while serving at U.S. military
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan
before heading to Iran for an
intelligence mission.
In December, Iran broadcast
a video on state television in
which Hekmati was shown
delivering a purported
confession and said he was
part of a plot to infiltrate Iran's
intelligence agency.
The U.S. government and his
family have denied the charges
against Hekmati.
Yesterday, the semiofficial
Isna news agency said the case
would be retried.
The report quoted state
prosecutor Gholam Hossein
Mohseni Ejehei as saying,
"There was an appeal on his
verdict. The Supreme Court
found shortcomings in the case
and sent it for review by an

equivalent branch" in the court
system.
The report did not elaborate.
Hekmati was born in Arizona
and grew up in Michigan, where
his father Ali Hekmati teaches
at Mott Community College in
Flint. Last month Hekmati's
mother Benhaz Hekmati visited
him in prison and met with
Iranian officials. Some saw this
as a sign that Iran might show
moderation in the case.
A lawyer for the family,
Pierre Prosper, welcomed
word of the retrial. Prosper
said he is "waiting for official
confirmation, but we are
pleased with reports coming out
of Tehran."
Prosper said the family is
looking forward to working
with the Iranian government.
The lawyer said an appeal has
been in the works and progress
in the case may be unrelated to
the escalating pressure on Iran
over its nuclear program.
Dawud Walid, executive
director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations'
Michigan chapter, described
the news of the new trial "as
a positive development." His
organization sent a letter in
January appealing for clemency
to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
Iran's supreme leader.
"We're hopeful that Mr.
Hekmati will get a fair trial with
transparency," Walid said.
A previous incident involving
Americans in Iran was resolved,
but only after two years.
In 2009, three U.S. citizens
were detained along the
Iraq border. The three said
they crossed the border
unintentionally during a hike.
They, too, were charged with
espionage, but there were no
specific allegations of CIA ties
and training as in the case of
Hekmati.

HADI MIZBAN/AP
Mourners pray over the coffins of security forces killed in attack in Haditha, Iraq, at their funeral in Falluah, 40 miles west
of Baghdad.
25 Iraqi police killed in
insurgent shooting spree

Attack seen as
attempt to reassert
al-Qaida power in
region
BAGHDAD - Assailants wav-
ing the battle flag of al-Qaida
gunned down 25 policemen
yesterday in a brazen and well-
orchestrated challenge to gov-
ernment control over a strategic
town fraught with Iraq war sym-
bolism.
The attack replicated tactics
used by Sunni insurgents during
the war and appeared aimed at
reasserting al-Qaida's grip now
that the Iraqis can no longer rely
on American help.
The attackers drove through
the town of Haditha claiming
to be government officials and
methodically executed guards
and commanders. After half an
hour they escaped into the des-
ert, leaving a terrified populace
demanding protection. Local
authorities imposed a curfew and
deployed troops.
Mohammed Owda al-Kubai-
si, a relative of one of the slain

policemen, spoke of his four chil-
dren, "now orphans because their
father was assassinated by the
cold blood of insurgency while
our government keeps watching
and denouncing."
The choice of target was sig-
nificant in several ways.
Haditha is just 65 miles (105
kilometers) from the border with
Syria, where rebels fighting the
regime are allegedly gaining
recruits from Iraq. During the
Iraq war the town of 85,000 was
a critical pawn in the battle, and
was overrun and held by al-Qaida
insurgents for months until U.S.
forces ousted them. It was also
the home of Abu Musab al-Zarqa-
wi, leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, as
well as the scene of a U.S. massa-
cre of civilians.
Iraqi officials described yes-
terday's attack as a system-
atic plot to kill policemen. The
attackers came at 2 a.m. in cars
painted as Iraqi Interior Minis-
tryvehicles and brandished false
arrest warrants for city police
officials. At the first checkpoint
they confiscated cell phones and
shot nine guards, said Moham-
med Fathi, spokesman for the
governor of Iraq's western

Anbar province, where Haditha
is located.
The convoy then stopped at
the homes of two Haditha police
commanders, including the
colonel who served as the city's
SWAT team leader. They were
killed less than a quarter of a mile
(400 meters) away, Fathi said.
He said the attackers had false
arrest warrants for 15 police
officials. At a checkpoint near
the main market a gun battle
broke out, with the gang raising
the al-Qaida flag, according to a
police lieutenant in Haditha who
spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to
release the information.
Six policemen were killed in
that skirmish, and another eight
were killed as security forces
chased the gang through the city,
Fathi said.
The police lieutenant said
most of the gang escaped north,
but one of the insurgents' cars
was shot up and found to con-
tain an al-Qaida flag, black with
a Quranic inscription, and al-
Qaida propaganda. Fathi said at
least one of the insurgents was
killed. Local police said three
were killed.

Egyptian lawmaker ousted
after lying about his nose job

Ultra-religious
political party
forces member to
issue apology
CAIRO (AP) - A lawmaker
from Egypt's most conservative
Islamist party resigned from
parliament after he was caught
lying to cover up a nose job,
claiming the injuries to his
heavily bandaged face were
from a carjackingand beating.
Parliament member Anwar
al-Balkimy represented the
Al-Nour party, whose members
known as Salafis follow a strict
interpretation of Islam that
forbids cosmetic surgery as
meddling in God's work.
The party said yesterday
that he had resigned and
Al-Nour was forced to issue an
embarrassing and apologetic
statement.
"In light of the regretful
incident involving Al-Nour
party lawmaker Anwar
al-Balkimy, the head of the
party, Emad Abdel-Ghafour,
wentto the hospital with a team
of party members to question
the lawmaker," itsaid. The party
added that it found his claims of
an attack were not true.
Al-Nur spokesman Nader
Bakar was quoted on the group's
official Facebook page as saying
al-Balkimy was expelled from
the party.
"Based on what the hospital
officials said, we decided to
expel him from the party, and so
he submitted his resignation,"
Bakar said, adding that
al-Balkimy apologized. "We are
tryingto bring forth a new set of
social values in politics based on
Islamic principles," he added.
"He may be suffering from an
emotional disorder."
Local media have been
awash over the past few days
with pictures of al-Balkimy's
face swathed in such heavy
bandages that only his eyes,
mouth and black-bearded chin
could be seen.
According to Egyptian
media reports, al-Balkimy
checked into a Cairo hospital
on Feb. 28 for plastic surgery
on his nose and the next day
checked into a second hospital,
where doctors said he tried to

claim he had been beaten and
mugged.
He also reported to police
that he was attacked during an
attempt to steal his car while
he was driving on the outskirts
of Cairo. He also claimed his
attackers robbed him of more
than $16,000.
His false claims led to an
outcry against the government
for failing to address a crime
wave that has been plaguing
Egypt since last year's uprising
ousted authoritarian leader
Hosni Mubarak. Just days
before the false report, an
Islamist presidential hopeful
was beaten in a carjacking, and
another Islamistlawmgaker was
injured in a hit-and-run.
While al-Balkimy was in the
second hospital, a stream of
visitors came to see him, among
them the head of parliament
who hails from the rival
Islamist party of the Muslim
Brotherhood.
The episode was a major
embarrassment for Al-Nour,
fresh off its strong showing in
parliamentary elections, which
turned out to be the biggest
surprise of the first free and
fair democratic vote in Egypt in
decades.
Al-Nour championseone
of the most conservative
interpretations of Islam, partly
inspired by Saudi Arabia's
Wahhabism, and wants Islamic
law strictly applied in Egypt.
It captured a quarter of seats
in both houses of parliament,
making it the second largest
party. The Brotherhood's party
won nearly half the seats in
parliament. Together the rival
religious parties control about
three-quarters of parliament.
The statement apologizing
for the lie was posted Al-Nour's
official Facebook page, where
there were thousands of shares
and "likes" on the post.
Hundredssresponded with
commenuts such as "you all
look really bad" and "how
embarrassing." One person
wrote: "Liars," using the
common refrain employed by
liberal activists against the
country's military rulers.
The state prosecutor is
waiting for al-Balkimy's
diplomatic immunity to be
lifted before interrogating
him.

Risky business
Michigan can't support new casinos
Twenty-two new casinos have been proposed for construc-
tion in Michigan. Both private investors and Native Ameri-
can tribes are pushing for more venues throughout the
Lower Peninsula. The proposed construction would almost double
the number of casinos in the state - there are currently 25. This
push comes in response to the record-breaking revenue of the three
Detroit casinos in 2011 - an astounding $1.4 billion. While more
casinos could help bring revenue to the state, doubling the number
has significant potential to oversaturate the market. Michigan is
not a destination gambling spot like Las Vegas, and too many new
casinos could hurt the existing ones.


One candidate needs to drop out after Super Tuesday
so there will be the correct number of stooges.
#SuperTuesday"
- Comedian Andy Borowitz tweeted about the Republican presidential
candidates in advance of today's ten Super Tuesday primaries.

Intelligence is relative

Two efforts, one led by Michigan First and
ballot proposal Michigan Is Yours, propose to
increase the number of casinos. The two pro-
posals call for four new casinos in Romulus,
two in Detroit, two in Port Huron and more in
Macomb and Oakland counties.
The obvious benefits of adding casinos
to the state include more jobs and a boost to
the economy. Outside of revenue taken in by
the casinos, patrons spend additional money
at local gas stations and nearby restaurants,
which benefits surrounding businesses.
Lansing Mayor virg Bernero is in favor
of some casino expansion. He has expressed
interest in having a casino in Lansing, and
thinks building casinos would be helpful for
cities outside of Detroit. Detroit currently hosts
three casinos: the MGM Grand Detroit Casino,
the MotorCity Casino Hotel and Greektown
Casino Hotel. Detroit seems to have enough
casinos already, and adding more could take
away revenue from the existing ones.
The casinos Michigan already has are
clearly successful. The record-breaking rev-
enues from 2011 are a testament to that. But
those numbers cannot be sustained forever.
An oversaturation of the Michigan market

will take away from existing casinos. Michi-
gan residents and nearby travelers will reach
a point where they won't spend any more
money in the industry. Once that point is hit,
the casinos will suffer.
In Las Vegas and other destination cities,
people travel from around the country and
world to visit the casinos and hotels. The
Michigan gambling demographic consists
mainly of Michigan residents and residents
in neighboring states such as Ohio and Indi-
ana. Without a huge market, it's doubtful
that Michigan would be able to support 22
new casinos.
Jake Miklojcik, president at Michigan
Consultants in Lansing, said Michigan could
safely support a 20-percent growth in casinos.
This number seems more realistic than a near-
ly 100-percent growth. Without a large audi-
ence for the casino expansion, doubling the
number in Michigan would be a risky gamble.
Choosing a safer route by adding a few casi-
nos in key areas would be a more responsible
alternative that would create jobs and boost
the surrounding area's economy. Overexpan-
sion will hurt the existing casinos and would
not be beneficial to the state.

E veryone is a genius.
But, if you judge a fish
by its ability to climb
a tree, it will spend its whole life
believing it is
stupid." This
Albert Einstein
quotation came
to mind several
times over the
course of last
week. These
profound words HARSHA
sum up an inter- NAHATA
esting idea -
intelligence is
relative. There isn't a singular cor-
rect measure we can use to judge
how smart someone is, and people
often are "geniuses" in different
areas. This begs the questions: How
can one single standard judge the
relative value of all different types
of talent? Can we really say one
type of "smart" is above, or better,
than another?
This past week, I was on an Alter-
native Spring Break trip in New York
City, volunteering at various non-
profit organizations. I spent a great
deal of time working at the Boys and
Girls Club, helping 2nd and 3rd grad-
ers with gym and homework.
These kids come from low-
income backgrounds, from the
inner city with inadequate resourc-
es and low academic achievement.
They come from the type of back-
ground characteristically por-
trayed as most likely to lack good
quality public education.
And yet, from my week working
with these kids, I can definitely say
they weren't by any means stupid.
Yes, some of them were easily dis-
tracted, but what 8 year old isn't?
The main problem wasn't that these
kids didn't care about school or that
they didn't want to learn. Often
times, they didn't understand the

way things were being explained
or couldn't follow the reasoning
behind what they were asked.
Looking over some of their prob-
lems and examples, this was no
surprise. The way that simple math
concepts - such as addition and
subtraction - were explained was
confusing, even to me. The lessons
complicated basic addition - add-
ing a series of steps and rules that
resulted in averylongand unneces-
sarily complicated process.
For example, let's look at an addi-
tion problem: 47+14. Instead of just
liningup the two numbers and add-
ing the ones and then the tens, as
we normally do, the kids were told
to first add 3 to 47 and subtract that
3 from 14. Then they would have to
add 50 and 11, coming up with 61.
The idea here is that it is easier to
add with numbers that end in zero.
Yes, this is a handyshortcut, but the
problem was there were no basic
addition concepts to add the short-
cut to.
One of the girls I worked with
struggled quite a bit with this long,
drawn-out process. When we lined
the two numbers up and added nor-
mally, she did it excellently - get-
ting almost every answer correct.
But the pages in the workbook that
required us to use this method were
a different story. She had trouble
keeping track of all the steps -
sometimes rounding one number
to the nearest zero but forgetting to
adjust the other - she would con-
fuse the order, or she just couldn't
understand what she was being
asked to do.
For kids who are just learning
concepts, teaching in a complicated
manner only adds to the confu-
sion. Moreover, the real goal isn't to
teach kids the shortcut, but instead
to make sure kids can add in the
first place. So, if a child is able to

easily add the long way and under-
stand what is going on, why force
them to learn a complicated short-
cut that will only throw them off?
Teach concepts,
not how to jump
through hoops.
The students are then tested not
on the basis of how well they know
the concepts, but on whether or not
they can use these various compli-
cated methods. If you asked the girl
I worked with to add, she would do
great. But on tests and homework
asking her specifically to employ
the shortcut she wouldn't do well.
There are times when it's good to
know different ways to do some-
thing, but in this case, whether or
not she knows the shortcut doesn't
really matter. It's not adding much
to her knowledge of the subject, but
she'll be punished for not knowing
how to do it.
Which brings me to the Ein-
stein's quote. A lot of what is defined
as smart or not has little to do with
actual intelligence and more to do
with how well someone is able to
answer questions in the way that
the test-givers want. This isn't
necessarily measuring true abil-
ity, but simply how well students
can jump through the hoops they
are told to. And here is where these
low-income kids will struggle most,
as they don't always have someone
telling them which loop to jump
through next.

Stick a tampon in it

'A re you there God? It's
me, an old white guy.
Now let's talk about

A few weeks ago, the Republican controlled
House of Representatives Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform Comittee members held a
congressional hearing on the Obama admin-
istration's proposed birth control mandate
to ensure women have access to birth control
with no co-pays, regardless of where they work.
Republicans refused to let a single woman
speak in support of the new birth control ben-
efit during the hearing. In fact, Republicans
said that a woman impacted by the policy and
who was scheduled to testify wasn't "appropri-
ate or qualified" to speak on the issues. A photo
of five men testifying before the House panel
went viral in a matter of minutes.
I, as well as many others, was outraged by
the congressional hearing's explicit exclusion
of women over a matter that concerns women's
bodies and lives. Regardless of religious and/
or political ideologies, 99 percent of sexually
active women have used birth control at one
point in their lives, according to the Guttm-
acher Institute. Isn't the pointof representative
democracy that the people who make the deci-
sions represent those who the decisions affect?
If I had the chance to speak on the panel,
this is what I would argue:
Birth control is basic health care, and its
accessibility to all women is vital. It enables
women to avoid unintended pregnancies,
but according to Planned Parenthood, it can
also provide protection against endometrial
and ovarian cancers; serious infection in the
ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus; iron defi-
ciency anemia; and premenstrual symptoms,
including headaches and depression to name a
few. It also reduces cramps or menstrual pain,
regulates menstruation and treats acne. In fact,
according to the Guttmacher Institute, only 42
percent of pill users have strictly contraceptive
purposes for the pill.

The Obama mandate enables all women
to have access to this essential health care.
Birth control can be extremely expensive - a
woman can sometimes pay up to $50 a month
for it, according to Planned Parenthood.
This high cost can prevent its accessibility
to many women. For example, one in three
women has struggled to pay for prescription
birth control and as a result used birth con-
trol inconsistently.
Many women who use contraception
already have children. They have knowledge
and experience pertaining to the cost of a
child and are making a pragmatic decision
based on their own well-being as well as their
family's. However, they may not be able to
enact this decision if birth control is too cost-
ly for them to afford. In fact, many women
who do not have the resources to raise a child
might also not have the resources to afford
birth control. This leaves some women in an
extremely difficult quandary.
Affordable birth control not only benefits
women but also the federal government. If
insurance companies foot the bill for contra-
ceptives then we are reducing potential gov-
ernment spending on childcare, foster services,
welfare services and the list goes on.
Lastly, this is a matter of women hav-
ing agency over their lives. This is matter of
women choosing to rely on themselves rather
than their partners in order to guarantee safe
and protected sex. This is a matter of women
having a say in their futures.
House Republicans are trying to drown
out this voice, and therefore we must spread
the message: We support the Obama admin-
istration's proposed birth control benefit that
ensures all women have access to birth control.

KRUVELIS

Or, at least, so goes the intro-
duction to Newt Gingrich's latest
autobiographical masterpiece, "Dr.
Strangelove or: How the Human
Pillsbury Doughboy Got With So
Many Hot Staffers." Or wait, was
that Rick Perry? Rush Limbaugh?
It's gettingso hard totell these days.
After all, as we get closer to the
impending doom - erm, the 2012
presidential election - it becomes
clearer: Our current Republican
leaders do not care about your
vagina. Or your uterus. Or "that
fappy thing that I will touch on
any woman who's not my wife."
Because when it comes down to
it, protecting the rights of half the
population? Upholding the egali-
tarian beliefs intrinsic to American
society? Not calling a law student a
slut on national radio? Sure sounds
like a bunch of women's troubles to
me.
Take, for instance, Texas. Now
there's a state that likes its eggs fer-
tilized. And if proposed budget cuts
are any indicator, Texans like eggs
a la less likely to be tested for ovar-
ian cancer, too. A year after massive
cuts to the state's family-planning
funds, the state is now calling for
elimination of its Women's Health
Program, a plan for reproductive-
healthcare services that helps nearly
130,000 women who fail to qualify
for Texas's strict Medicaid require-

ments. The reason? Under federal
law, Texas can't prevent care provid-
ers like Planned Parenthood (or any
other qualified medical care provid-
er) from WHP plans.
The logical response: refuse the
millions of federal dollars offered
to the state to fund WHP, discon-
tinue the program and leave the
low-income women of Texas -
which is the state with the high-
est level of uninsured women - to
fend for themselves when it comes
to annual exams, STI testing and
access to birth control.
And since the well-being of hun-
dreds of thousands of women isn't
enough of an attention-grabber
these days, here's a dose of repro-
ductive irony for you: those abor-
tion clinics that the state legislature
was so hell-bent on exterminating?
Well, 14 Planned Parenthood clin-
ics in Texas that perform abortions
somehow had the foresight to cut
themselves from any state-affilia-
tion and currently run as separate
entities. Since these clinics don't
receive any state funding, the pro-
posed cuts really won't stop them
from terminating any unwanted
pregnancies, throwing birthday
parties for the antichrist, or what-
ever else abortion clinics do. As for
the other 51 Planned Parenthood
clinics that provide reproductive
healthcare to women in the state?
Well, yeah, they're screwed. But you
know what they say - everything's
bigoted in Texas.
I don't mean to pick on the Lone
Star State. To be fair, there are plen-
ty of other politicians that care just
as much about women as Bush cared
about black people and Lou Bega
cared about Mambo No. 6. Like
Newt Gingrich, for example. To his
credit, I've never seen a beached
whale so interested in the female
reproductive system. For the past
several decades, Gingrich's aerial
attacks on areolas and all things
women read like the back of Now

That's What I Call Misogyny - "99
Problems But a Ditch Ain't One,"
"Pro-Life on Mars?" and that time-
less classic, "Women's Rights are
Dumb and Stuff, Pt. II." Remember
the so-called Personhood Amend-
ment, the Mississippi legislation
that declared that life begins at
fertilization? Despite the defeat
of ballot initiative, Gingrich still
wants to see a nationwide expan-
sion of the failed bill, ultimately
making all abortions illegal, even in
cases of rape, incest or to save the
life of a woman. And good news:
Gingrich isn't alone. Both Gingrich
and Rick Santorum have vowed to
only appoint pro-life justices to the
Supreme Court bench, a move that
ultimately places the life of a fetus
over the life of a woman.
Our Republican
leaders don't
care about
your vagina.
And as I sit here, blasting Alanis
Morissette and pounding away at
my keyboard, I just have to wonder
- when was the last time I shaved
my armpits? But perhaps more
importantly, will the conserva-
tives ever care about the unshaven,
alternative Canadian rock, angry
women types? But since I'm just
about out of room, and I'm tired,
and I'm just not interested in filling
the opinion page with any more
platitudinous rants, I'll end with
one lastbit of advice. When it comes
to women's rights, the Republicans
need to step up or, better yet - stick
a tampon in it.

publicized investigation could
be damaging to an employee's
career.
The committee continued by
debating the wording of the res-
olution and its potential impli-
cations. Specifically, SACUA

eral calls for comment regarding
the status of the problem.
University officials are work-
ing to increase efforts to improve
the quality of the gyms, as dis-
cussed at University President
Mary Sue Coleman's fireside chat
with students last month . At the
event, Harper and Coleman dis-
cussed further surveys and col-
laborations among consultants
and student advisory panels on
enhancing recreational facilities.
LSAseniorVivianYu, president

for improvement of recreational
facilities on campus, said Rec
Sports buildings are important to
the student experience.
"These buildings embody stu-
dent life on campus," she said.
"When students go to the Rec
Sports buildings, they are looking
to de-stress, to relax and to exer-
cise and to have a better experi-
ence on campus."
Yu said she thinks there is a
definite need for improvement of
recreational facilities and tech-

decided to subsitute the word
"children" with "minors" in the
official resolution because of the
University's middle- and high-
school student programs.
SACUA will continue to edit
the resolution and approve at
its meeting scheduled for next
Monday. Koopmann added that
further revisions are necessary
before a permanent resolution is
approved.
"I think it's wrong to put
something out this morning and
expect to approve it this after-
noon," said Koopmann.
nology.
"I'd say ... there is an under-
standing that buildings and
technology are behind current
standards," she said.
Mariani said she is disappoint-
ed with the stagnant monitors
installed in the gyms.
"I feel like if they get them,
they shouldn't just have them to
say they have TVs; they should ...
be working with channels," she
said.
Medical School student Yashar
Niknafs said he thinks that even
if the televisions were operation-
al, they wouldn't be worthwhile
to the students exercising at the
gyms.
"There are only three TVs for,
like, 1,000 pieces of equipment,"
Niknafs said. "Even if they are
turned on, I don't think they will
be all too effective."
Rather than working televi-
sions, Niknafs said he would pre-
fer other changes at gym facilities
including an increase in upgraded
equipment, which the University
has been working to implement
over the past year through replac-
ing outdated machines.

the coming months, as young
people will be critical to Obama's
re-election efforts.
"Young people came out in
huge support of the president
back in 2008, and that made all
the difference," Penn wrote.
"We want to make sure they get
involved again."
Penn wrote that Thursday's
event will be a good opportunity
for students to have an open dis-
cussion of the presidential cam-
paign.
"You'll hear some great con-
versations and also have a chance
to meet abunch of the President's
young campaign organizers and
volunteers," Penn said. "The vibe
tends to be really respectful and

conversational, and there are
plenty of opportunities to sign up
to get more information on vol-
unteering."
LSA freshman Pavitra Abra-
ham, a campus organizer for the
Obama campaign in Ann Arbor,
is scheduled to speak at the event
and said she thinks the event will
help unite Obama supporters
and foster healthy discussion on
political issues that impact col-
lege students.
"I think all of us involved
are really excited and optimis-
tic about everything he's done
and everything he's capable of
doing," Abraham said.
Abraham said she is excited
that Penn is coming to campus as
a prominent national figure tak-
ing political action.
"It really goes to show, no mat-
ter what your occupation is, that

what happens in the political
arena affects everyone," Abra-
ham said. "I think it's great to see
a prominent political figure like
himself taking part in really get-
ting the youth active and excited
in a cause he believes in."
Matt McGrath, Obama's
Michigan press secretary,
said students who want to get
involved with the Obama cam-
paign will learn about many
opportunities for participation
on Thursday.
"There are untold numbers of
ways to help," McGrath said.
The campaign will also stop
at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison tomorrow before the
visiting the University.
Doors to the event open at 6
p.m., and the discussion begins
at 7 p.m. The event is open to the
public, but space is limited.

plan.
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3), who voted
no on the transit agreement last
night, said he wanted to continue
exploring different options for
transportation in the city.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) echoed Kunsel-
man's sentiments, and said she
was concerned with the binding
nature of the agreement.
"It is not a question of yes or
no but how to accomplish it and
at what pace," Lumm said.
Other members, including
Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3), countered
these arguments and said that
the plan is not binding, only a
first step in the direction toward
an effective mass transit system.
"The issue tonight is that the
four-party agreement doesn't
cost us anything," Taylor said.
"It only puts out the idea that
we want a mass transit system
in Ann Arbor."
The meeting extensively
addressed amendments to the
plan, including clarifying the
text of the document to give
more power to Ann Arbor in

the party agreement, which was
largely shot down.
Taylor and councilmember
Marcia Higgins (D-Ward 4)
said equal jurisdiction is crucial
for ensuring that all the parties
stay involved in the transit plan.
At the start of the meeting,
five residents spoke in agree-
ment with the four-party agree-
ment, urging Council to support
it.
Ann Arbor resident Elizabeth
Donoghue Colzin spoke about
the importance of broadening
transit throughout the region,
despite the possibility that tax
rates could increase.
"I would encourage you in
your efforts to move this for-
ward," Colzin said. "If this were
to be added to the millage, I
would vote for it. I would like
to pay for transportation in this
county and I hope that this four-
way agreement would move for-
ward."
Carolyn Grawi, an Ann Arbor
resident and a representative
of the Ann Arhor Chamher of
Commerce, said she wanted
the agreement to pass because
it would assist the disabled and
elderly. She mentioned a survey
commissioned by the AATA in
which 86 percent of the respon-
dents said there is a need for

door-to-door service.
"We need to look at how (resi-
dents), as the puzzle piece in the
center of the county, the key
part to that region, are going to
figure out the element of what
needs to take place," Grawi said.
Ann Arbor attorney Christine
Green spoke on behalf of the
Michigan League of Conserva-
tion Voters, saying that she was
in favor of the four-party agree-
ment for its potential to create
jobs and foster environmental
efforts in the community.
"Bus transportation is a
healthier, more active mode of
transportation. It create jobs
and helps local businesses. (It)
revitalizes the city," Green said.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said he approved of the proj-
ect because of the widespread
support of the residents and
the aforementioned community
programs.
"Public transit and expand-
ing public transit is something
we are going to need if we are
going to continue on that path,
and I know its easy for us to
see why two organizations like
the Chamber of Commerce and
the Conservation Voters would
come together at the same meet-
ing and endorse this proposal,"
Hieftje said.

Fires in Republic of Congo
detonate nearby explosives

Officials work
to try to prevent
future damage,
injuries
BRAZZAVILLE, Republic
of Congo (AP) - International
experts fought yesterday to pre-
vent a fire from reaching a second
arms depot and exploding more
munitions, a day after a blaze set
off blasts so violent they flattened
buildings, killing hundreds and
trapping countless others under
debris.
9 Small detonations continued
to shake Brazzaville, capital of
the Republic of Congo, yester-
day. Sunday's blasts buckled
numerous buildings including
two churches and a hospital and
exploded windows nearly 10 kilo-
meters away across the Congo
River in the heart of Kinshasa,
capital of the neighboring Cen-
tral African nation of Congo.
"For the time being, there are
Russian, French and Congolese
experts in the field who are try-
ing to put out the fires. Their goal
is to prevent the fires reaching
a second depot of even heavier
weapons," said Delphin Kibaki-
di, spokesman of the local Red
Cross.
Ongoing explosions and fires
hampered attempts to rescue
hundreds believed trapped under
debris.
A large crowd gathered outside
the municipal morgue, which
along with a nearby hospital had
registered 206 deaths hours after
the first blast on Sunday.
In two hours Monday, another
seven corpses were brought in,
bringing the death toll to at least
213.
Among them was Mathias
Ikinga, who brought in the body
of his only son, a boy he mourned
"who was really intelligent and
had a promising future."
Some of the bereaved labored
under their loss and anger at
their government.
Successive governments "have
never understood that a depot of
weapons of war in a residential
neighborhood represents a great
danger to its citizens," raged
Ikinga, 32.
"It's far easier to avoid these

incidents than to deal with
the deadly fallout," said Chris
Loughran from the Mine Adviso-
ry Group's headquarters in Man-
chester, Britain. The group has a
team in the country working on
cleaning up munitions contami-
nation from a 1997 civil war.
Loughran said unplanned
explosions at munitions sites are
an increasing phenomenon, with
more than 50 explosions in 34
countries since 2009. Many are
in developing countries that store
munitions' in cheap or unsafe
buildings, and countries where
conflicts have ended and muni-
tions are aging.
In coup-prone countries, it's
common to have a barracks and
munitions depot in populated
cities. Brazzaville, a small city of
1.3 million, has at least five such
camps.
The country got a taste of this
weekend's tragedy three years
ago, after a 2009 explosion of
munitions. Then, the govern-
ment promised to move such
depots outside the city, said a dip-
lomat who asked not to be named
because he was not authorized to
speak on the subject. On Sunday
night, a government statement
again promised to remove all
munitions depots from the capi-
tal.
. The death toll is expected
to rise as rescuers begin clear-
ing the debris including from St.
Louis Catholic Church, in front
of the exploding tank regiment's
camp, where dozens of worship-
pers were attending Sunday Mass
when the building buckled under
the blast.
Mission chief Jan Diplo of
Medecins Sans Frontieres, or
Doctors Without Borders, said he
had registered 936 injured people
being treated at three hospitals,
where his organization donated
kits used to treat burns. Others
wounded have gone to private
hospitals, while dozens more
injured were still arriving Mon-
day, he said.
"Most of the injuries we're see-
ing are traumatic injuries from
people who have had houses col-
lapse on them," Diplo said.
He said the overburdened hos-
pitals needed everything, espe-
cially supplies for surgery. One
hospital treating the wounded
made an appeal on national radio

for donors to give blood.
The World Health Organiza-
tion's Kinshasa office sent 2.5
metric tons of medication to treat
traumatic injuries on Sunday, said
spokesman Eugene Kabambi.
A team of unexploded ord-
nance experts from the Mine
Advisory Group, funded by the
European Union, said they were
working with the government to
help clear the area of danger.
"More lives are thought to
be in danger from the threat of
unexploded ordnance kicked out
by the blast. Early reports indi-
cate that the incident has seen
potentially unstable projectiles
scattered around urban areas,
already causing a number of
explosions and subsequent fatali-
ties," a statement from the group
said.
People are fleeing the neigh-
borhoods closest to the epicenter
of the blast. Kibakidi said that the
Red Cross had set up two camps
inside churches, and had already
welcomed some 600 refugees.
The government says it has taken
charge of the many children
found wandering alone, appar-
ently separated from their par-
ents in the chaos.
"It is estimated that thousands
have effectively been displaced
and lost their homes. Several
schools were also destroyed by
the blasts," said a U.S. Embassy
statement reporting on a meet-
ing of foreign ambassadors with
government officials yesterday.
It said the United States, other
embassies and non-governmental
organization were working with
the government on how best to,
deliver aid.
Government spokesman Bien-
venu Okyemi blamed a short
circuit for the fire that set off
the blasts. In a statement to the
nation, President Denis Sassou-
Nguesso described the ordeal as
"a tragic accident." And the coun-
try's defense minister rushed to
reassure people in this nation that
the fire was not a sign of a coup or
a mutiny.
Among the dead were six
employees of a Chinese construc-
tion firm which had 140 Chinese
workers at its construction site
when the first blast happened,
according to the Chinese news
agency Xinhua. Dozens were
injured.

Obama, Netanyahu clash
on how to deal with Iran

Both leaders pledge
unity in Oval
Office meeting
WASHINGTON (AP) - Tak-
ing sharply different stands,
President Barack Obama yester-
day urged pressure and diploma-
cy to prevent Iran from getting a
nuclearbombwhile Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
emphasized his nation's right
to a pre-emptive attack. Even in
proclaiming unity, neither leader
gave ground on how to resolve
the crisis.
Seated together in the Oval
Office, Obama and Netanyahu
at times tried to speak for each
other, and other times spoke
past one another. The president
and prime minister are linked
by the history and necessity of
their nations' deep alliance, if
not much personal warmth, and
both sought to steer the Iran
agenda on their terms.
"I know that both the prime
minister and I prefer to resolve
this diplomatically," Obama
said. "We understand the costs
of any military action."
If he agreed, Netanyahu said
nothing about sanctions or talks
with Iran, or Obama's position
that there still is time to try to
deter Iran peacefully. Instead,
Netanyahu drew attention back
to Obama's acknowledgement
that Israel is a sovereign land
that can protect itself how it
sees fit.
"I believe that's why you
appreciate, Mr. President, that
Israel must reserve the right to
defend itself," Netanyahu said.
Israel, he added, must remain
"the master of its fate."
Israel has not yet decided
whether to launch a unilateral
strike on Iran, a point under-
scored in the White House
meetings.
Across days of comments,
speeches and interviews,
Ohamaand Netanyahu left no
doubt about where they stand
on Iran. Far less clear is wheth-

er they have done anything to
alter each other's position in
what has become a moment of
reckoning over Iran, and an
important foreign policy issue in
the U.S. presidential race.
Both are adamant Iran must
not develop a nuclear bomb.
Obama's aim is to keep Israel
from launching an attack on
Iran's nuclear facilities, fearing
that would do little lasting good
toward the goal and engulf the
region and the United States in
another war.
Senior Obama administra-
tion officials said the talks at the
White House left the two sides
closer than they were a week
ago. The Israelis walked away
with prominent statements from
Obama that he would not stand
for containing a nuclear-armed
Iran, and that the crisis was in
the United States' interests to
solve.
In turn, Israelis did acknowl-
edge privately they would prefer

a diplomatic solution, despite
enormous skepticism of the Ira-
nian government, officials said.
And there were no demands
that Obama set a new "red
line" of what it would take for
a U.S. strike - the U.S. position
remains that Iran must not get a
nuclear weapon.
The officials spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity to discuss the
private conversations.
Netanyahu emphasized that
Israel must defend itself from an
Iranian nuclear threat.
He said after his talks with
Obama: "I think I was listened to
and understood."
The last time the two men met
in the Oval Office, in May, Netan-
yahu lectured Obama in front of
reporters as differences over
Mideast peace unfolded. This
time, theirbody language as they
spoke was not so glaring but still
telling: Obama addressed the
media; Netanyahu spoke directly
to Obama and locked on him.

Petition drive aims to overturn state's "
emergency financial manager law

Measure could end
up on ballot this
November
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
State-appointed emergency
managers such as Louis Schim-
mel, assigned to save the city of
Pontiac from financial peril,
are armed with superpowers
that enable them to leap city
councils and union contracts in
a single bound.
That soon could change. A
petition drive aimed at repeal-
ing a 2011 Michigan law that
gave state-appointed managers
their sweeping authority could
serve as kryptonite, nullify-
ing the enhanced powers they
claim are crucial. State elec-
tion officials likely will decide
within two months whether
opponents of the emergency
manager law have gathered
enough valid voter signatures
to temporarily suspend the

measure and put it before vot-
ers for a final verdict in the
November election.
If Public Act 4 is suspended,
emergency managers would no
longer have the ability to uni-
laterally strip locally elected
leaders of their power or toss
out union contracts. Barring
court decisions or further
action by the state Legislature,
it appears Michigan's emer-
gency manager law would at a
minimum revert to Public Act
72 of 1990 - leaving the state-
appointed officials on the job
but with fewer weapons to bat-
tle financial crises.
The result: It likely would
take emergency managers lon-
ger to fix the financial problems
facing the cities and schools
they're assigned to run.
"There were a lot of things
I could not do that were frus-
trating under Act 72," said
Schimmel, who served as
emergency financial manager
in the Detroit enclave of Ham-

tramck from 2000 to 2006
before becoming Pontiac's
emergency manager last year.
"The difference is you don't
have as many powers," Schim-
mel said. "The main one is you
can't deal with the labor con-
tracts under the old act like the
new one."
Schimmel, appointed by
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to
take over as Pontiac's emergen-
cy manager in September, said
he was able to resolve issues
with labor contracts in his first
four months on the job. He also
shook up Pontiac's city hall in
November, firing the city clerk,
attorney and director of pub-
lic works as he moved to put
together his own team.
The Snyder administra-
tion expects that all previ-
ous decisions and agreements
crafted by Schimmel and
the state's other emergency
managers - also operating in
Benton Harbor, Ecorse, Flint
and school districts in Detroit

and Highland Park - would
remain in place if Public Act
4 is suspended. But they'd
have diminished powers mov-
ing forward, including within
areas that might need future
state intervention. Republi-
can lawmakers who control
the Legislature are looking at
possible contingency plans if
the emergency manager law
is suspended, but it's not clear
what measures, if any, might
be attempted.
The goal would be a tem-
porary measure to leave some
aspects within Public Act 4 in
force until voters cast the final
verdict in November, said Ari
Adler, a spokesman for House
Speaker Jase Bolger, a Republi-
can from Marshall.
"All the voters in Michigan
get to have their voices heard
in November," Adler said. "But
the concept behind a tempo-
rary law would be that we
don't want chaos to ensue in
the meantime."

Talks on future U.S. military
presence in Afghanistan slowed


Negotiations hinge
on several divisive
issues
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Negotiations over a long-term U.S.
military presence in Afghanistan
have bogged down over issues of
detainees, night raids and quar-
rels within the Afghan president's
inner circle, throwing the whole
deal into question.
The arrangement would for-
malize a U.S. role after NATO's
planned pullout in 2014. The dead-
lock reflects growing hostility on
the part of the Afghan leadership
and increasing exasperation in
Washington.
Trust has eroded in recent days
with anti-American protests over
Quran burnings at a U.S. base,

a rising number of U.S. troops
gunned down by Afghan security
forces and election-year demands
to bring the troops home.
Karzai met last night with
U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
but a Karzai spokesman did not
return phone calls requesting
details about their talks. Karzai
has scheduled a news conference
today;it is unclear whether he will
discuss the negotiations.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Gavin
Sundwall would not disclose any
information about the meeting.
Earlier, Sundwall said that
despite the dragging negotia-
tions, the U.S. was committed to
a strategic partnership with the
Afghan people. However, he also
said it was more important to get
the right agreement than to get an
agreement.
The pact is expected to provide

for several thousand U.S. troops to
stay and train Afghan forces and
help with counterterrorism oper-
ations. It aims to outline the legal
status of those forces, their oper-
ating rules and where they will be
based. The agreement, which was
supposed to be completed before
the next NATO summit in May in
Chicago, also is seen as means of
assuring the Afghan people that
the U.S. does not plan to abandon
the country, even as it withdraws
its combat forces.
NATO's nighttime raids target-
ing insurgents are an especially
touchy matter.
As part of the agreement, Kar-
zai has said that Afghans should be
the only ones conducting the night
raids, because the invasion of pri-
vacy from troops entering a fam-
ily's home is compounded when
the soldiers are Westerners.

Bird abandons complexity

The tunes of
trekking home

'Break It Yourself'
veers to the simpler
side of songwriting
By KATIE STEEN
Daily Arts Writer
Fans of Andrew Bird who
pride themselves on their abil-
ity to understand the violinist's
enigmatic mus-
ings may want
to find a new
hobby. Bird's Andrew Bird
latest LP Break
It Yourself is Break It
pretty easy Yourself
listening -
straightfor-
ward and
pleasant. While the peculiar lyr-
ics and shifting melodies of Bird's
older albums prodded his listen-
ers to pick the mind of the com-
plex artist, his newest work is less
brain, more barebones.
In a way, Bird caved in with
Break It Yourself In describing
his motivation for the album to
online magazine The Quietus, he
explained how he surrendered
to the lures of frankness. "Some-
thing happened when I was writ-
ing this record," Bird said. "I got
a little tired of the poetics in a
sense. And I wanted to just make
a more direct record." While this
approach allows for a slightly
more relatable and easygoing
record, it leaves listeners longing
for the exotic excursions of past
albums such as Andrew Bird Â£t
the Mysterious Production of Eggs
and Noble Beast.
Break It Yourself starts off
deceptively eerie with "Despera-
tion Breeds..." (even the song title
is a cliffhanger). It begins with
unhurried plucking - a classic in
any given Bird album - and unin-
telligible, spacey murmurs in the
background. But the track quickly
clears the fog, falling into a pulse
that is calm but punctual, eventu-
ally evolving into a more hopeful
sound. The song seems reassur-
ing in tone, and as the introduc-

MOM + POP

"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful."
tion to the album, it appears that
listeners can expect the capri-
cious work of Bird they're used to.
The subsequent track is
"Polynation," a wordless 45-sec-
ond buffer for future disap-
pointment. It's simultaneously
haunting and cheery, ending with
a baby's babbles. The start of the
album is a bit of a red herring,
serving as a stark contrast for
much of the rest of Break It Your-
self Though some tracks such
as "Give It Away" and "Sifters"
begin with impressive pizzicato
that seems to hold promise for
the rest of the song, they end up
falling into a rut of tired choruses.
When Bird is left to solely
instrumental experimentation,
the sound is precise and expertly
crafted. There is no denying his
extraordinarytalentwith the vio-
lin and beyond, so when he begins
cozying up to the simple com-
forts of the folk genre, he seems
strangely laidback. Listeners are
accustomed to Bird's ability to
make his one-man symphonies
seem effortless, but if his sound

becomes too casual, you might
find yourself reaching for a pillow
and craving the dreamlike other-
worldliness of Bird's past work.
When even the angelic vocals
of St. Vincent (Annie Clark) in
"Lusitania" fail to inspire, it's an
indication that the music is get-
ting a little too down-to-earth.
But reality need not be dull. In
"Near Death Experience Expe-
rience," Bird sings that "we'll
dance like cancer survivors." For
a track that talks about some-
thing so terrifyingly real, the
artist maintains an assuredness
and jazz that affirms fearless-
ness against death. More impor-
tantly, it has an energy that
makes listeners want to dance,
regardless of medical status.
"Eyeoneye" is another widely
relevant track as Bird discuss-
es standard issues like broken
hearts. He doesn't attempt to
add metaphors to the point of
incomprehensibility - he wants
listeners to understand and
relate to him. The song avoids
cliche with simple but charming

guitar melodies and, of course,
Bird's signature whistling.
Unfortunately, the majority
of Break It Yourself feels down-
sized, as if Bird didn't feel like
putting in the effort of crafting
the poetry his fans have come
to expect. There's a rational,
content sound to the album that
makes for good background
music but ultimately dissatisfies
if you're looking for the ethe-
real creations Bird is capable
of. For instance, "Anonaminal,"
a five-minute track from Bird's
last album, constantly changed
shape, resulting ina wonderfully
bizarre creature. At one point in
the song, Bird completely aban-
dons the melody, pausingto sing,
"Hold on a second, don't tell me
this one you know, I know this
one, I know this song." The Bird
of long ago might seem indig-
nant at the idea that a listener
would fully figure out his music.
But with Break It Yourself, most
songs are comfortable and pre-
dictable. Bird needs to spread
those wings.

Twelve a.m. on a Mega-
bus out of Pittsburgh,
it looks like Picasso's
"Guernica". Midnight light and
the glow of a single laptop reveal
snoring bod-
ies contorted
every which
way. People
with their
foreheads
jammed into
the seats
in front of JOE
them, drool- DIMUZIO
ing on their
shoes, while
headphones echo faint rhythms.
Too caffeinated to sleep, I put
in my headphones, shuffling
around acid house and William
Basinski before settling on the
new Burial record - tailor-made
for staring out windows at pass-
ing lights in some form of public
transit by night. I'm headed to
New York. I'm visiting my sister
in Brooklyn. It's my last "spring
break." I press play.
The turnpike choreographs
some accompaniment. Distant
valleys of porch lights, zooming
SUVs, blinking satellites. "Kin-
dred," the first track, thuds and
pulses around a vocal sample
chopped into anonymity. It
sounds like Whitney - or at least
her ghost. I run with that. I have
seven hours to contemplate it.
During my first full day in
Manhattan, I meet my cousin
Larry in front of Trinity Church
after a falafel breakfast, the sun
shining. We walk past the World
Trade Center, Wall Street, Zuc-
cotti Park. We grab coffee and
sit on a bench, and inevitably,
he recounts old family stories.
He tells me about my mother,
things I'd never heard. Her
brothers, in their makeshift
basement clubhouse, playing
Paul Anka ("who's Lebanese," he
points out) loudly, making her
one-year-old cheeks bubble over
to "You Are My Destiny." He
recalls my family in the kitchen,
in a circle before a meal, parad-
ing her around the floor, chant-
ing Arabic. "It was so strange,"
he said, laughing. "Your mother
knew how to dance before she
could walk."
We walk over to J&R Records,
chatting about Marvin Gaye,
Yusef Lateef's Detroit, free jazz,
record stores disappearing...
"Keep listening to Ornette," he
tells me as we part ways.
I meet some friends to walk
across the Brooklyn Bridge at
sunset. I notice my friend always
seems to hum under her breath,
tone-free, almost whispering.
We talk and take pictures, heli-
copters and tugboats drifting
past us, as I begin to realize
this constant noise, this end-
less reverberation. Subways,
airplanes, taxis, music ... in New
York, there's a perpetual roar
behind everything.

The next day, I'm in Green-
point for doughnuts, records
and maybe some kishka (which
means "guts" in Slavic). Drop-
ping into a Thai place for lunch,
I can't ignore the music as I'm
chowing fried rice. It's an online
radio station, playing slow stuff,
safe stuff. "Only love songs"
it says, after aslush, orchestral
swell. I listen for contradictions
in the songs and find none. I
begin to think that every song
ever written is a love song,
knowing I'm wrong.
I find my way to a junk
shop with a whole basement
of 12-inch dance records piled
to the ceiling. I think it might
be heaven, but I'm not patient
enough to find out. One man
wears a surgical mask as he
fingers through pile after pile.
I spend an hour findinga nice
stack before crumbling out of
neck pain and dust inhalation.
New York City
is alive with the
sound of music.
In Brooklyn Heights I find
Halcyon, a shop somewhere in
between a Zen garden and Wax-
poetics' wet dream. The guy at
the counter notices I've picked
up an Andy Stott record and,
while cashing me out, waxes
over seeing him play in Berlin. I
can't hear his story because the
store's speakers' bass is turned
up so high his voice is drowned
out. But he smiles, losing his
words and nodding after staring
into some distance. I thank him
for the story and receipt before
getting lost again.
I'm lugging my bag down
the Pittsburgh Strip as the sun
comes up. After twilight, on a
seven-hour layover, I've given
myself 20 minutes to catch the
Detroit-bound bus. A solitary car
speeds past and I catch a snippet
of a Shirelles tune but it might
be nothing. My brain exploded
two or three hours ago over hot
sausage and slimy coleslaw at
the 24-hour Primanti Bros. on
Penn Avenue, after sippingcof-
fee for five hours. What's left of
me pushes toward the last leg of
my trip.
I meet an old high-school
friend by chance, waiting for the
bus, headed home. Her break's
kicking off as mine ends. I laugh
as I tell her this is my last vaca-
tion for a long time. The bus
kicks off toward Cleveland.
People slip on their headphones.
The sun turns everything into a
shadow. I fall asleep like a baby.

poetically than you. To learn how,

Lesser-known American Idol'
albums reveal talent of contestants

By GREGORY HICKS
For the Daily
Many followers of indie groups
- hipsters excluded - sit in frus-
tration, trying to deal with the
fact that their favorite artists
will never get the recognition
they deserve. But believe it or
not, artists who premiered on the
most-watched television show in
America, "American Idol," have a
great deal of undiscovered trea-
sure as well. Hipsters, you may
now find it acceptable to listen
to pop music. Take a gander at
these albums that stayed relative-
ly under the radar, despite their
singers being quite reputable on
the show.
DavidArchuleta's The Other
Side ofDown
I was absolutely disgusted
when I heard the promotional
single for this album. The auto-
tuned, bubblegum mess that was
"Something 'Bout Love" had me
thoroughly convinced that Archu-
leta's career was over after the
success of his self-titled album
and "Crush."
That was before Archuleta
made an appearance on my Face-
book newsfeed, insisting his fans
listen to the track "The Other Side
of Down" from his new album. I
obliged, then instantly shared it
with everyone in the immediate
area. The voice, production and
lyrics all embodied great, pure
malepop, and not some fake, mod-
ern-Enrique-Iglesias-R&B-style
song disguised as pop.
Shortly after that, I gave the
whole album a listen. I felt myself
"Stomping the Roses" as arrogant
friends of mine refused to change,
while at the same time trying to
figure out "Who I Am," only to
"Look Around" and realize I'm in
a "Good Place" and can't "Com-
plain." And if you can complain,

find "The Other Side of Down"
and know "Things Are Gonna Get
Better." Get ready to relate and
relive your adolescence.
It's a cheesy album, but Archu-
leta makes it work with his
innocence and talent. Sadly, the
promotional single and other-
wise lack of promotion killed the
album's chance at success. No
songs charted.
Jordin Sparks's Battlefield
Sparks's promotional single
for the album, "Battlefield", was
the only song to chart - actually,
it became a top-10 hit - which I
found quite misleading, seeing as
it's one of the more boring tracks
on the album. You can also ruin
the song for yourself by listening
to the faint, wobbly synth in the
background (commence banging
head against wall).
You have to
listen deeper
than the singles.
IfArchuleta's album is refresh-
ing for its style, Sparks's album is
refreshing for its lyrical origi-
nality so often lost in pop music.
The first track on the album,
"Walking On Snow," could easily
be a top-10 song. Not only is it a
catchy, original melody, but it's
also a catchy, original metaphor,
with love being like "walking on
snow without leaving a trace" -
makes more sense than certain
artists with the last name Perry
feeling like a plastic bag that
wants to start again.
"No Parade" is another well-
executed metaphor, narrating the
fairy tale ending that didn't come
when the end of her relationship

came swooping in out of nowhere.
Battlefield has a nice variety
in its amount of electronic pro-
duction. It's lighter on songs like
"Faith" and heavier on others
like the sampled "S.O.S. (Let the
Music Play)." This tune was fairly
popular on the dance charts, pos-
sibly for its phenomenal Jason
Nevins remix.
Blake Lewis's
A.D.D. (Audio Day Dream)
Runner-up to.Jordin Sparks in
season six, Blake Lewis's debut
album invokes amazingly individ-
ualistic style with a mainstream
sound. Lewis continues using his
famous beatboxing skills while
also utilizing the songwriting and
producing skills of Ryan Tedder,
lead singer of OneRepublic.
Upon hearing the album for the
first time, I was slightly confused

as to why it had died so quickly. It
clearly had high production value
from quality songwriters and pro-
ducers - Lupe Fiasco even makes
an appearance. And it had the
edgy, electronic-pop style that is
so popular nowadays.
That's when it dawned on me:
2007 was the year of Beyoncd's
"Irreplaceable," Avril Lavigne's
"Girlfriend" and Maroon S's
"Makes Me Wonder." Electronic
music still had negative connota-
tions until it caught on like wild-
fire the following year.
Many of the songs that were
formerly reviewed as abstract are
currently quite normal. And as
for the rest, Lewis has a soothing
*NSYNC quality to his voice -
especially with former *NSYNC
member Chris Kirkpatrick doing
backup vocals for the album - that
leaves listeners reminiscing on the
era of boy-band heartthrobs.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Freshman forward Alex Guptill finished the regular season as the Michigan hockey team's leading scorer, collecting a total of 15 goals and 31 points.
Gupti 1 celebratesirthday
with All-Rookie honor

ByMATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
Alex Guptill certainly didn't
have a case of the Mondays this
week. The freshman forward
entered his third decade of life
and was named tothe CCHAAll-
Rookie team.
Pretty good birthday, eh?
"Definitely," Guptill said.
"Turning 20 and then you hear
that news - it's special. ... I'm
really happy to be able to share
it with myself, my family and my
teammates."
When Michigan coach Red
Berenson was informed of Gup-
till's accomplishment, neither
shock nor glee were evident on
his face. His standout freshman
earned the honor by racking
up 16 goals - tied for the most
among NCAA first-year skaters
- en route to 31 points.
The rookie's campaign was
enough to draw praise from the
league's coaches, but the team-
mates that flank Guptill are the
ones that speak highest of him.
Junior linemate Chris Brown
doesn't simply think his center-
man is one of the best in the con-
ference.
"I think he's one of the most

dominant freshmen in college
hockey," Brown said.
The scoring prowess isn't
something Berenson expected
of Guptill coming in. Berenson
didn't see a future decorated goal
scorer when he saw Guptill play
for the Waterloo Black Hawks
of the United States Hockey
League last year. Instead, he saw
an extremely raw skater who had
to develop if he wanted to see the
ice his freshman season. Beren-
son had a laundry list of Guptill's
shortcomings after his first times
seeing him play.
"He needed to ramp up his
defensive awareness and his
work ethic, shift after shift, and
even puck management," Beren-
son said. "There were a lot of
things that he had to get better
at."
Guptill struggled to find his
hockey identity in the USHL.
Injured and without a serious
role on the team, he turned to
Michigan and Berenson to fine-
tune his game. It didn't take long.
"When he got here, I was
impressed," Berenson said. "He
was ahead of where he was (in
2010). I thought his game was
better - his skating (and) his
puck touches."

But Berenson wasn't the only
one who recognized the poten-
tial in Guptill. Brown sees a lit-
tle bit of senior linemate David
Wohlberg, who was named to
the All-Rookie team during his
freshman campaign, in Guptill.
"He's got a scoring touch I
haven't seen in a long time -
probably since Wohlberg won
(the award)," Brown said.
But the always-humble Wohl-
berg thinks bigger things await
the protegd. Wohlberg has been
riddled with injuries through-
out his Michigan career, only to
finally find his stride this season.
Guptill, he thinks, brings more
to the table, at least at that young
age.
"I think people expect more of
him and he's given more," Wohl-
berg said. "So in that aspect, he's
(more) well-rounded than I was
at that time."
Ever since the trip to Alaska,
when Michigan began to turn
its season around, Guptill and
Wohlberg have been pacing the
Wolverines on their top line
along with junior forward Chris
Brown.
Before Berenson made that
switch, Wohlberg said, Guptill
was more of a "grinder" while on

the fourth line.
"He's really just opening his
eyes and learning from every-
one else around him, " Wohlberg
said. "He's become a really good
player."
Since Wohlberg was also
a highly touted freshman, he
knows firsthand how special it is
to be recognized at such an early
stage.
And though expectations for
Guptill will most assuredly be
higher next year, this honor is
the trademark of the beginnings
of a successful college career.
"It's awesome," Wohlberg said
of the recognition. "It's the cul-
mination of a pretty good year,
and then you have a chance to
win a national title after that and
help your team that way. I know
(Guptill's) looking forward to
that."
Not bad for a Monday.
NOTE: With Bowling Green's
upset victory over Northern
Michigan last weekend, Notre
Dame becomes Michigan's quar-
terfinal opponent. The Fighting
Irish will play in Ann Arbor on
Friday and Saturday, with a deci-
sive game three on Sunday if nec-
essary. Saturday's contest will be
televised on Comcast.

Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS - It took two
overtimes on Sunday to decide a
winner.
With the game tied at 56,
Purdue junior Courtney Moses
drove to the basket, going for the
game-winning layup. Her shot
was blocked, and a desperation
attempt at the buzzerby Nebraska
sophomore Jordan Hooper came
up short, forcing the first over-
time.
But that wasn't enough. Nebras-
ka senior Kaitlyn Burke missed
an open 3-pointer and Purdue's
final shot was blocked, forcing
the a fifth overtime in the last two
meetings between the teams.
The fourth-seeded Boilermak-
ers dominated the second extra
period. Purdue led 73-70 in the
final minutes, and the sixth-seed-
ed Cornhuskers couldn't find an
open look to tie. Purdue lifted the
tournament trophy for the first
time since 2008.
Sunday night's thriller wrapped
up the four-day, 11-game tourna-
ment at Banker's Life Fieldhouse.
The action began on Thursday,
with four consecutive first-round
games. Seventh-seeded Michigan
and 10th-seeded Illinois opened
tournament play in the morning,
when the Wolverines avenged a
second-round loss in last year's
tournament with a 68-53 win.
Senior guard Courtney Boylan
led all scorers with 17 points, and
junior guard Kate Thompson
and junior center Rachel Shef-
fer chipped in 13 and 12 points,
respectively.
The Fighting Illini duo of
Karisma Penn and Adrienne God-
Bold were limited in Thursday's
game thanks to a combination of
Michigan's consistent defense and
their own foul troubles.
The Wolverines held Illinois
scoreless from the field for nine
minutes in the first half, and Penn
was benched early in the second
half, when she picked up her third
personal with 16:25 on the clock.
That sealed the game for Michi-
gan. There were three more games
that afternoon, with 11th-seeded
Northwestern and sixth-seeded
Nebraska facing off soon after the
end of the first game. The Huskers
opened the game with a 41-10 run
and scored a tournament-record

54 points in the first half, winning
in convincing fashion, 88-56.
The third game featured Big
Ten Freshman of the Year Rachel
Banham, who led eighth-seeded
Minnesota against ninth-seeded
Wisconsin.
The Golden Gophers crushed
the Badgers, 81-49, and Minnesota
went on to face regular-season
champions Penn State.
Thursday's final game pit-
ted fifth-seeded Michigan State
against 12th-seeded Indiana. The
Spartans shot 51 percent from the
field and outrebounded Indiana,
38-29, en route to an easy 97-68
victory.
Friday's first matchup was a
defensive battle, as both the Wol-
verines and Buckeyes were held to
season-lows in points. The Wol-
verines kept it close for most of the
half, but the Buckeyes held on for
a 57-48 win.
In the second game, four Husk-
ers scored in double digits to
end the Hawkeyes' win streak.
Nebraska won, 80-68, and took on
Ohio State in the first semifinal.
The matchup between the
Golden Gophers and the Lady
Lions was arguably the best game
of the tournament up to that point.
Minnesota couldn't hold on to a
13-point halftime lead, but a late-
game push and a 3-pointerby Ban-
ham closed the gap to two points.
ButPenn State sophomore Maggie
Lucas sunk two free throws to ice
the game and win, 78-74.
In the final game of the quar-
terfinals, Rayburn went 7-for-10
from beyond the arc to seal Pur-
due's victory and a matchup with
Penn State in Saturday's second
semifinal.
On Saturday, Nebraska contin-
ued its winning ways, making a
strong push to become the first
team in tournament history to
win four games in four days. The
Huskers dominated the boards
against Ohio State and went on to
win, 77-62.
The second game on Saturday
went down to the wire. With time
winding down, Rayburn drove
to the hoop and hit the game-
winning layup to lift Purdue over
the regular-season champions
in a thriller, 68-66. That set up
Sunday's championship matchup,
where first-year Big Ten member
Nebraska took on but ultimately
fell to the Boilermakers.

helps Hardaway Jr.'s draft stock
- NBA scouts want winners, and
Michigan tends to roll when the
sophomore stud is in rhythm.
But Hardaway Jr. is not nearly
ready for the pros, and I doubt
he'll enter the draft after this
season.
The star has certainly shown
flashes of brilliance. His 25
points on a mere seven attempts
from the field at Illinois last
week displayed the type of effi-
ciency scouts like to see in their
prospects. But it's also the type
of efficiency that has eluded
Hardaway Jr. through most of
the season.
As fun as he is to watch when
he finds his stroke, Hardaway
Jr.'s cold streaks are frequent
and unbearable to watch. Scouts
won't be impressed with his sub-
30 shooting percentage from
behind the arc, and they'll be
underwhelmed with his ball-
handling skills, which have
hardly improved since his fresh-
man campaign.
But I admit I may be speak-
ing too soon. Last week, Grant-
land writer Davy Rothbart asked
Hardaway Jr. if this was his last
season at Michigan, and his elo-
quent response was, "No. We
don't know yet. I'm not sure."
Take that for what it's worth.
The Wolverines may well have
a lot of basketball left to play. If
Hardaway Jr. goes on a torrid
run through this weekend's Big
Ten Tournament in Indianapo-
lis and leads Michigan to its first
Sweet Sixteen since 1994, it may
be enough for him to cash in.
And yes, in that case, having
the regular-season conference
title in his back pocket obviously
helps his draft stock.
How will the absence of a

Tourney?
-Steven Katz
Not having a premier front-
court is a concern. The elite
programs - the Kentuckys and
Syracuses - have some of the top
big men in the nation, and it's no
coincidence they're ranked so
highly.
How Michigan performs
through March is dependent on

a number of factors, but sopho-
more forward Jordan Morgan's
performance is near the top of
that list. The Wolverine front-
court is thin in the absence of
sophomore forward Jon Hor-
ford, who injured his foot back in
December. And if Morgan finds
himself in foul trouble against
a team that likes to bang under-
neath, Michigan may be in trou-
ble.
But don't forget that Mor-

gan has the ability to turn some a
heads. Against Ohio State in Ann
Arbor last month, he held Jared
Sullinger in check through most
of the contest and added 11 points U
and 11 rebounds of his own.
So, Michigan's frontcourt
could contend, but it's fragile. If a
Morgan has to sit with two fouls
early in the first half of a Sweet
Sixteen matchup against, say,
Kansas, you may want to close
your eyes.
