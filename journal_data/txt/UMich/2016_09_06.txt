Former 
President 
Bill 

Clinton joined United Auto 
Workers 
union 
members 

and others for the annual 
Detroit Labor Day Parade 
Monday 
morning 
aiming 

to demonstrate the Hillary 
Clinton 
campaign’s 

commitment 
to 
working 

families.

The parade began at 9:30 

a.m. 
and 
marched 
down 

Michigan Avenue. Bill Clinton 
marched, but did not speak 
during the event which drew 
thousands of union workers 
and other prominent state 
Democrats. 
The 
annual 

parade in Detroit has drawn 
important 
Democratic 

figures in the past, including 
President Barack Obama in 
2008 and Vice President Joe 
Biden 2012 and 2014.

The parade’s theme was 

Your 
Vote 
is 
Your 
Voice 

and 
was 
dedicated 
to 

supporting working families 
and improving unions, as 
well as encouraging voter 
registration.

LSA junior Collin Kelly, 

chair 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
said 
Bill 
Clinton’s 
visit 

demonstrates 
that 
Hillary 

Clinton 
is 
the 
candidate 

who will best represent the 
interests of the working class.

“Bill Clinton coming to 

Detroit on Labor Day signifies 
the commitment of both the 
Democratic Party and the 
Clinton family to honoring, 
protecting and fighting for 
workers across the nation,” 
he said. “Unions built this 

country, but only Democrats 
seem to remember that. Bill 
Clinton knows that unions are 
part of why America is great, 
and he understands they are 
indispensable for our future.”

Clinton’s appearance was 

one of several similar events 
held by surrogates for his 
wife’s 
campaign 
Monday: 

Hillary Clinton, along with 
running mate Sen. Tim Kaine 
(D–Va.) and Biden, hosted 
events in other Rust Belt 
areas such as Cleveland and 
Pittsburgh. 

In a statement released 

Monday 
morning, 
Hillary 

Clinton 
emphasized 
her 

commitment to workers in 
Michigan, citing her support 
for the auto industry and 
criticizing 
her 
opponent 

Donald Trump, stating that 
his policies would only harm 
the middle class.

“Don’t let anyone tell you 

we can’t ‘Make it in America’ 
anymore,” 
Clinton 
said. 

“Michiganders are proving 
every single day that we can 
still compete and win in a 
global economy.”

Bill Clinton’s visit followed 

a Michigan stop by Trump 
on Saturday at Great Faith 

Ministries 
International 

church 
in 
Detroit 
as 
an 

attempt to court Black voters. 
This was Trump’s third visit 
to the state since his official 
nomination in July. 

Hillary 
Clinton’s 
most 

recent visit to Michigan was 
on Aug. 11, when she addressed 
workers at Futuramic Tool 
& Engineering to talk about 
how her economic plans are 
best suited for the working 
class.

Though a recent Suffolk 

University 
poll 
showed 

Clinton up by 7 points in 

Ten months after the city 

Human 
Rights 
Commission 

published 
a 
42-page 
report 

calling 
for 
an 
independent 

audit of the Ann Arbor Police 
Department, the city manager’s 
office has started taking the 
initial steps toward meeting the 
HRC’s recommendations.

The report called for a review 

of department practices as well 
as the creation of a civilian-run 
police oversight board. It was 
created in wake of a community 
push for police oversight reform 
of the the 2014 shooting death of 
Ann Arbor resident Aura Rosser, 
a Black woman, by an AAPD 
officer. 

Different 
recommendations 

will follow different timelines. 
In a memo released on Aug. 
31, 
City 
Manager 
Howard 

Lazarus released a tentative 
plan for hiring a police auditor, 
who would conduct an audit 
of the AAPD’s internal review 
protocols and communicate the 
results.

Under Lazarus’s timetable, 

the request for contracting an 
auditor would be written with 
community input and released 
by the end of October. The 
auditor would be contracted 
by the end of December with 
City Council approval. Once

Members of the University of Michigan football team celebrate with students after defeating Hawaii, 63-3.

After 
intercepting 
Wilton 

Speight’s 
first 
pass 
as 
the 

starting quarterback for the 

Michigan football team, Hawaii 
briefly challenged the prevailing 
notion that they were about to be 
on the receiving end of a blowout 
at Michigan Stadium.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Rainbow Warriors, that notion 
was quickly reaffirmed when 
they promptly lost seven yards 
and punted the ball four plays 
later.

Moving 
backwards 
would 

become a recurring theme of the 
game for Hawaii, which had an 
abysmal negative-17 total yards 
at the end of the first quarter 
and needed a strong second half 

See POLICE, Page 3A

There was over a 50 percent 

decrease in alcohol and drug-
related hospital visits during 
the first five weeks of school 
at UM last year according 
to Advocate, a Student Life 
Incident database. In the first 
five weeks of the 2013 and 2014 
fall semesters, more than 100 
cases of alcohol- and drug-
related hospital visits were 
reported to the University of 
Michigan through the database. 
In 2015, there were fifty.

There is no data available yet 

for 2016. Officials pointed to 
several reasons for the drastic 
change, including dry Welcome 
Week events, programs created 
by Wolverine Wellness and 
increased support from the 
Department of Public Safety 
and Security and other law 
enforcement agencies.

Beginning in the 2014 school 

year, 
the 
University 
began 

new 
initiatives 
to 
reduce 

student alcohol and drug use 
by shortening Welcome Week, 
the period between student 
move-in and the first day of 
class. Based on the data from 
Advocate, DPSS spokesperson 
Diane Brown said they believe 
the shorter Welcome Week 
contributed to a decline in 
alcohol-related 
emergencies

professionally, I can tell you.”

Trump hosted a reserved 

event, travelling with just a 
few of his Black supporters — 
including former Republican 
contender Dr. Ben Carson.

The 
GOP 
candidate 
also 

decided to give a short speech to 
the congregation, after turning 
down the offer previously. The 
speech lasted 10 minutes — 
an uncharacteristically short 
speech for the candidate.

Trump chose not to speak 

about the situation of African 
Americans or to ask them to 
take a chance on him, as he did 
when visiting Akron, Ohio, in 
August. Instead, he praised the 
work of Black Christians and 
spoke of the hope that America 
can “turn again to our Christian 
heritage to lift up the soul of our 
nation.”

Trump also called for more 

conversation among different 
communities in the United 

States.

“We talk past each other and 

not to each other,” Trump said. 
“And those who seek office do 
not do enough to step into the 
community and learn what’s 
going on. I’m here today to 
learn, so that we can together 
remedy injustice in any form, 
and so that we can also remedy 
economics so that the African-
American 
community 
can 

benefit economically through 
jobs and income and so many 
other different ways.”

Both religious and Black 

voters will be important to 
Trump in building a winning 
electoral map. Trump currently 
has close to four-fifths of 
white, evangelical voters, but 
isn’t polling nearly as well 
among the African-American 
community, and a recent Wall 
Street 
Journal/NBC/Marist 

poll found Trump has zero 
percent of the Black vote in 
two key swing states: Ohio and 
Pennsylvania. Another WSJ/
NBC poll found Trump polling 
at 1 percent of the Black vote 

nationwide compared to Hillary 
Clinton’s 91 percent.

Saturday’s stop was Trump’s 

second attempt at appealing 
to 
the 
African-American 

community in Michigan, albeit 
in noticeably different fashions. 
When Trump made a campaign 
stop in Dimondale, Mich. last 
month, he spoke of issues he 
hoped to improve within the 
African-American community, 
particularly in cities like Detroit.

While 
speaking 
to 
a 

predominantly 
white 
crowd 

in Akron, Ohio, last month, 
Trump said, “Our government 
has totally failed our African-
American friends, our Hispanic 
friends and the people of our 
country. ... What the hell do you 
have to lose? Give me a chance. 
I’ll straighten it out.”

Trump’s changing message to 

African-Americans has drawn 
a range of reactions in past 
months including significant 
backlash after his Dimondale 
and 
Akron 
comments. 
His 

Detroit speech was more well 
received by the public.

Sunday night on the Diag, about 

100 students gathered around the ‘M’ 

to honor the late 17-year old western 

lowland gorilla Harambe, who was 

shot at a zoo on May 28. Organizers 

said they intended the event to serve 

as a space where students set aside 

their differences in order to honor the 

animal.

Harambe was killed at the 

Cincinnati Zoo last spring after 

a four year old boy fell into his 

enclosure. Two of the other gorillas 

in the exhibit were led back inside 

by zookeepers. Harambe, however, 

could not be coaxed back in and was 

considered a danger to the child’s life.

Internet footage showed the 

gorilla dragging the child through 

water, helping him to his feet, and 

pushing him. After a few minutes, zoo 

officials made a decision to shoot.

In the days following, memes of 

Harambe and various other gorillas 

went viral, with many expressing 

outrage at the zoo’s choice to shoot.

LSA junior Jenna Roby said she 

heard about the vigil online and went 

to the event out of curiosity. She found 

it hard to tell whether or not people 

actually cared about the animal’s 

death.

“It was a very interesting 

experience, because I couldn’t tell 

who was taking seriously and who 

was just doing it for a laugh,” Roby 

said.

During the vigil, students lit 

candles in remembrance while 

standing around a stuffed gorilla and 

banana.

Roby said she met people who 

had drove 45 minutes to attend the 

event.

“In general it was pretty amusing 

to see all this happening over an 

Internet meme,” Roby said. “I thought 

Harambe jokes were funny, and now 

maybe a little overdone, but I haven’t 

really thought anything deeper than 

that.”

Over the past few months, the 

viral images of Harambe have been 

used to convey a series of causes 

beyond the gorilla’s death. Among 

some conservative groups, Harambe 

memes were popularly used to 

mock what they described as liberal 

hysteria. Among others, Harambe 

memes were used to detail the lack 

of coverage of real issues on social 

justice in the mainstream media. 

Months after the gorilla’s death, the 

incident has become infamous. Rap 

artist, Young Thug, recently recorded 

a song called “Harambe,” who he 

names as one of his idols.

LSA junior Will Jermyn, another 

vigil attendee, said he was also not 

sure what to make of the event.

“I thought it was kind of strange,” 

he said. “At first I wasn’t sure what 

it was. I was walking through and 

all these people started chanting 

‘Harambe.’ I started laughing because 

I thought it was kind of ridiculous.”

hired, the auditor will evaluate 
AAPD community engagement 
processes through the end of 
June 2017, with a final report 
communicated by the end of July 
2017 and a follow-up performed 
in February 2019. However, the 
other main recommendation 
— the oversight board — won’t 
start being implemented until 
August 2017.

Lazarus said in an interview 

Friday that he chose to delay 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 

oversight board until after the 
completion of the audit to allow 
for sufficient public input and to 
ensure transparency. He added 
that 
all 
major 
stakeholder 

groups he has communicated 
with 
— 
the 
HRC, 
AAPD, 

National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
and the local police union — 
have all responded favorably to 
his framework.

“I want to make sure there’s 

sufficient 
time 
for 
public 

discussion, and I want to not 
be guilty of over-promising 
and under-delivering,” Lazarus 
said. “This is an important 
effort, and I don’t want to rush 
through it. I don’t want either 
side to think we just went 

through the motions to get to a 
pre-determined outcome.”

Lazarus 
also 
emphasized 

that 
public 
discussions 

regarding 
the 
creation 
of 

a civilian review board — 
which would have the power 
to independently investigate 
complaints against the AAPD — 
will also not begin until August 
2017, using the audit’s findings 
as a framework.

This decision comes after 

the HRC and AAPD Chief 
Jim Baird publicly disagreed 
during the summer on whether 
a civilian oversight board is 
necessary in Ann Arbor.

In a June memo to City 

Council, 
Baird 
expressed 

reservations that the push for 
increased police oversight in 
Ann Arbor was tied to national 
events as opposed to actual 
local problems. He suggested 
that concerns about a lack of 
transparency in how the AAPD 
investigates complaints against 
its 
officers 
are 
overblown. 

While not outright ruling out 
support for a civilian oversight 
board and the HRC’s other 
recommendations 
of 
the 

creation 
of 
crisis 
response 

teams, Baird urged that no 
further action be taken until 
after the completion of an audit.

Amid a renewed national 

outcry over police brutality 

in July, the HRC put out its 
own statement calling for the 
implementation of a review 
board to begin independently 
of the audit of the AAPD. The 
HRC also noted it was not 
directly criticizing the AAPD, 
but rather emphasized the goal 
of its recommendations is to 
build police-community trust.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

HRC chair Leslie Stambaugh 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 

timeline outlined by Lazarus. 
Though 
she 
acknowledged 

some people may be concerned 
by the long timeframe before 
the creation of a review board, 
Stambaugh 
wrote 
she 
was 

confident this would allow for 
an effective implementation.

“At this point, any timeline 

might seem too long to some, 
but the one described here is 
realistic and promises to be 
both inclusive and effective,” 
Stambaugh wrote, also noting 
that her commission intends 
to be active through the entire 
process. 

“I think the fact that this 

process is designed to be 
inclusive 
early 
on 
should 

create a good foundation for 
implementation 
down 
the 

road and appreciate that the 
City Administrator made it his 
priority in the first two months 
of his administration.”

on campus, though it is worth 
noting that in both 2013 and 
2014 a home football game took 
place during Welcome Weekend. 
In 2015, one did not.

Wolverine Wellness director 

Mary Jo Desprez said certain 
factors 
during 
periods 
like 

Welcome Week that contribute 
to alcohol- and drug-related 
conflicts, 
such 
as 
a 
home 

football game, are out of the 
control of Wolverine Wellness 
and the police departments.

Because of that, Desprez 

said 
the 
University 
began 

launching efforts to reduce 
those instances. Recently, this 
has included the University’s 
creation of an alert system for 
parents of freshmen students 
who have had a second run-
in 
with 
alcohol 
or 
drugs. 

Additionally, they have updated 
the Stay in the Blue phone 
app. Created in 2013, the app 
helps students estimate their 
blood alcohol content, order 
cabs, track drinking events and 
even displays a list of events 
happening in Ann Arbor.

The University also hosts 

marketed dry events, such as a 
Friday-night event at the Union 
that provides activities, games 
and food as a sober alternative 
to off-campus parties.

According 
to 
the 
Center 

for 
Campus 
Involvement, 

the number of students who 
attended 
UMix 
has 
almost 

doubled since last year, with 
5,258 students attending the 
nearly weekly events in 2014 
and 10,132 in 2015.

Other 
efforts 
include 

sober 
monitor 
training 
for 

new 
Interfraternity 
Council 

members and the mandatory 
AlcoholEdu 
online 
course 

for incoming freshmen and 
undergraduate 
transfer 

students. 
This 
is 
the 
first 

academic year that all four years 
of students on campus have 
completed this course.

Desprez 
said 
it 
is 
the 

combination of these efforts, 

among others, that makes the 
difference in reducing alcohol-
related incidences. 

“The most important thing 

to know is that these efforts 
are most effective when they’re 
done in combination, not just 
as one thing,” she said. “We 
always try to do the next best 
thing or we use evidence-based 
strategies. We have dogged 
determination 
to 
prevent 

harm. I think having a plan but 
then also having collaborative 
partnerships are the two most 
important things.”

DPSS Chief Robert Neumann 

also cited programs aimed at 
off-campus students such as 
Beyond the Diag, as well as a 
partnership between the DPSS 
and the Ann Arbor Police 
Department serve to reduce 
conflict.

Last 
week, 
Beyond 
the 

Diag, 
working 
with 
DPSS, 

canvassed the neighborhoods 
near campus. This included 
providing off-campus students 
with information about Stay 
in the Blue, wellness coaching 
and other safety and security 
resources.

Neumann said the community 

canvassing event allows them to 
meet off-campus students and 
inform them about resources.

“It’s an important part of the 

whole picture of engagement 
with our off-campus residents 
to promote their safety and to 
let them know what services are 
available here at the University 
of Michigan, as well as services 
that are available from the city 
and other providers,” he said.

As for Welcome Week itself, 

Neumann said DPSS prepares in 
advance to keep students safe.

“We do bolster patrols and 

enforcement activity because 
this is a high-risk period — 
this time between move-in and 
classes,” he said.

Before last year, DPSS was 

not responsible for off-campus 
incidents, though they could 
work in cooperation with AAPD. 
As of last year, however, DPSS 
gained county-wide authority 
to 
operate 
independently 

from AAPD. Though it still 

coordinates its work with the 
city police, a formal agreement 
was made with the Washtenaw 
County Sheriff’s Office that 
grants it permission to enforce 
the law beyond the bounds of 
campus.

Brown 
said 
the 
main 

objective with this expanded 
authority is to continue to raise 
awareness and educate people 
about off-campus safety by 
doing presentations in Greek 
houses and co-ops as well as 
working with Beyond the Diag 
leaders.

“(The police officers) are 

there to help build relationships, 
share 
information, 
answer 

questions about nuances with 
the laws, and discuss when 
students can say, ‘No, you can’t 
come in my house,’ to a police 
officer, and when they need to 
allow them in,” she said.

Desprez also said fraternities 

have helped contribute to the 
reduced number of alcohol-
related incidents in recent years 
by not serving hard alcohol at 
early parties.

Engineering junior Roy Ziv 

said sober monitor training, 
required 
for 
all 
fraternity 

pledges, was useful in terms of 
preparing for a party.

“I 
thought 
it 
was 
very 

helpful,” he said. “It highlighted 
the importance of how we 
should split up sober monitors: 
some at the front door, some by 
the bathrooms or staircases, 
some roaming around the party. 
It showed us what to keep an 
eye out for, and what to do in the 
case of an emergency.”

Ziv also mentioned that his 

fraternity house has a water 
fountain and water bottle filler 
in order to keep people hydrated 
at parties.

“We are always exceeding 

the minimum number of sober 
monitors we should have,” he 
said. “We had our biggest party 
the other night. We’re supposed 
to have a minimum of five 
sober monitors, but I believe 
we had seven or eight because 
we understood the importance 
of keeping everyone safe and 
organized.”

the 
state, 
Michigan 
is 

considered a possible swing 
state this election cycle. 
Trump receives a large 
amount of support from 
non-college educated white 
men, making the middle 
class and the Rust Belt states 
particularly 
important 

for Clinton. In 2012, this 
demographic 
represented 

nearly half of all voters, and 
currently Trump is doing 
even better with this group 
than Mitt Romney, the 2012 
Republican nominee.

CLINTON 
From Page 1A


A

s the school year came to a 
close last spring, I had an 
idea for a column. A tirade, 

really. 
Rather 

than study for 
the impending 
finals 
week, 

make headway 
on the 14 papers 
that 
would 

be due in the 
next week or 
even make the 
rare proactive 
choice to begin 
packing, I was 
going to write 
an 
article 

about my take on Central Student 
Government elections.

I knew that I was not alone in 

thinking participating in CSG is a 
ludicrous exercise of the most self-
important students quibbling over 
the minutia of what little change 
they 
could 
actually 
facilitate 

on 
campus, 
while 
annoyingly 

flooding me with Facebook event 
invitations and beating the drum 
of a made-up political party that 
will exist for all of six months. 
But on Sept. 15, I very well may be 
proven wrong.

When the Board of Regents 

meets that night, it will consider 
an addition to the bylaws that 
would 
provide 
for 
the 
vice 

president 
for 
student 
life 
to 

“assist 
students 
in 
promoting 

the establishment of effective 
mechanisms 
for 
such 
student 

participation” 
in 
recognition 

of the importance of “student 
participation 
in 
University 

decision-making.” 
For 
this 

revision, CSG, and in particular 
new CSG President David Schafer, 
should be applauded.

For 
reasons 
passing 

understanding, the language above 
was removed in February 2011. As 
the bylaws stand today, the most 
substantial forum the student 
body has at the Board of Regents’ 

monthly meetings comes in the 
form of reports delivered by the 
CSG president on current student 
government projects. Even with 
this statement’s proposed return 
— reaffirming the importance of 
student voices in decision-making 
— the Board of Regents is just 
talking about talking. Simply put, 
that is not good enough.

Now is the chance for CSG 

and the host of elected student 
representatives (the same people 
who chased me down in the 
Diag and covered my dorm room 
door 
in 
quarter 
sheets 
with 

platitudes about change) to use 
this momentum, and the spirit of 
this vote, to induce radical change 
in the way students relate to the 
Board of Regents. If you want the 
student body to truly care in the 
next election cycle, get a seat at 
the table.

The first step in this process is to 

use accurate language. The bylaw 
states, 
“Student 
participation 

in 
University 
decision-making 

is 
important 
to 
the 
quality 

of the institution and will be 
sought and encouraged.” No, our 
participation is vital. Schafer said, 
in relation to this vote, “Students 
are 
certainly 
a 
very 
major 

stakeholder at Michigan.” No, we 
are the ultimate stakeholder. The 
decisions that are made at the 
Board of Regents level are about 
how we live, what we study, how 
much we pay and the University 
community to which we belong. 
And right now, these decisions are 
being made without us.

Just in case, at this point, you 

think real change is a long shot, 
student bodies around the country 
have adopted functioning and 
sustainable 
infrastructure 
for 

student voices to be heard at the 
highest level. At the University 
of Hawaii, a current student is 
appointed for a two-year term 
as a full, voting regent, and has 
been since the practice began in 

1997. The University of California 
system has benefitted from the 
input of a student regent since 
1974. Real change is possible. It 
has happened. It works.

Tuition at the University rose 

once again in June, passing at the 
Board of Regents by a vote of 5 
to 3. The cost of room and board 
rose with it, and ultimately, the 
University now expects to raise 
$1.31 billion in tuition and fees, up 
from $1.28 billion last year. Why? 
To make college more affordable, 
cycling some of that money back 
into 
financial 
aid, 
lowering 

the new cost of college. If that 
argument seems counterintuitive 
to you, that’s because it is. And I 
want a student in the room, saying 
that. 
Regent 
Andrea 
Fischer 

Newman (R), who voted against 
the tuition hike, asked, “Are we 
raising tuition because we can, 
rather than because we need to?” 
I want a student whose voice can 
join hers.

Now maybe a student regent 

is not the answer. Maybe it is 
not feasible, or cannot happen 
until years down the road. But 
the idea in itself is a start. The 
purpose of student government is 
to represent our interests. At the 
Board of Regents meeting Sept. 
15, for the first time since I began 
studying here, it seems as though 
that idea may become a reality.

To CSG and to the students 

who have chosen to represent 
me: Prove me wrong. Set change 
in motion that will, at the very 
least, give our student body the 
possibility to discuss what student 
representation at the Board of 
Regents might look like. I will 
happily eat my words and suffer 
through the onslaught of Facebook 
invites and quarter sheets when 
elections roll around again in 
March with a smile on my face.

Maybe we needed a Trump
D

onald 
Trump 
announced 
his 

presidency 449 days ago. Today, Mr. 
Trump is the Republican nominee, 

one who will not easily 
be forgotten. Trump’s 
odyssey to the top of the 
ticket was first viewed 
as a dinner table joke for 
most, but now it’s a fact: 
Donald Trump has garnered the nomination 
surely and swiftly. His erratic, beyond-the-
pale tactics had many predicting a quick 
exit from the race. Instead, with each 
primary, the tan-faced, unpredictable and 
undoubtedly blunt Trump knocked his 
fellow Republicans off the ticket. However, 
now the comedy of Donald Trump’s 
candidacy has faded, replaced by the 
powerful reality that the popularity of Mr. 
Trump has both exposed and expanded the 
polarity of America. But maybe we needed 
that to happen.

Many, including myself, question how 

people could vote for someone who lacks 
all traits of a — to put it simply — normal 
politician. Well, the answer seems to be in 
the question. Some people in this country 
are done with the traditional leaders. 
As many experts have said in the past 
months, Trump’s appeal is derived from the 
displacement of specific sects of Americans.

The Times’s David Brooks described 

Trump’s supporters as “a coalition of the 
dispossessed,” citizens who have seen 
nothing but hardship from the current 
system. Trump’s stray from conventionality 
is not only a beacon of hope, but also a 
seemingly quick fix to the faulty system 
they see. Whether Trump truly intends 
to help these working class populations is 
not relevant. His unpredicted garnering 
of support reveals the unrest of unheard 
Americans, and, to some extent, it is needed.

As we are caught up in expanding 

economies, 
advancing 
technology 
and 

gentrification of cities, we forget who 
we are leaving behind. According to the 
Washington Post, Trump’s supporters tend 
to be uneducated, male and making less 
than $50,000 a year. For them, hardship 
rather than success has come from the ever-
changing America of the last 10 years.

The presidential election has seemed to 

polarize Americans, as most visibly seen 
in The New York Times’s video of Trump 
rallies, where angry Americans cheered, 

“Build the wall,” and participated in 
offensive rhetoric. It was a scary sight. Yet, 
it needed to be seen; it needed to be heard. 
These Americans are no longer tossed 
aside or hidden under greater issues; this 
time, thanks to Mr. Trump, they share his 
spotlight. This has resulted in a polarized 
nation, yet an unlikely group has come 
together to make a change against a Trump 
backdrop: politicians.

While neighborhood politics has become 

polarized, in one way Washington has 
seemingly taken steps to come together. 
It’s not often you see Republicans publicly 
endorsing Democrats. This slew of GOP 
members includes not just members of 
Congress, 
but 
foreign 
policy 
leaders, 

business donors and previously elected 
Republicans. This isn’t to say that all 
Republicans have become die-hard Clinton 
fans, but this degree of support is unheard 
of, especially during a presidential election. 
In past years, it has almost been taboo for 
Democrats and Republicans to agree on 
anything, yet the Trump phenomenon has 
done what 20 years of conventional politics 
has failed to do: bring politicians (slightly) 
closer together.

It’s a wake-up call for politicians, and it 

is two-fold. For one, it shows how different 
parties can come together. And second, it 
shows the unacknowledged vulnerability 
of displaced Americans. I’m not saying 
those who thoroughly support Trump 
aren’t supporting a man who has insulted 
almost 
every 
demographic, 
but 
their 

support represents their discontent with 
the status quo. It has brought to center stage 
an unhappy population that has shown it 
is a threat to traditional politics. And the 
traditional politicians have seen what this 
mass of Americans can do.

A possibly naive thought: I think the 

Trump experience could ultimately bring 
politicians together and, in turn, create 
policies that address the silent majority who 
fervently support Trump. Trumpism has 
revealed the faults of the American system, 
a system politicians and citizens alike are 
responsible for. We have heard the unrest 
of our neighbors and Washington has heard 
the unrest of its constituents. Maybe we 
didn’t want a Trump, but we needed one.

Breeding the leaders and best
“C

ongratulations, Jason 
— You’re in!”

Much to my delight, 

I was officially 
the 
newest 

member 
of 

the Wolverine 
family. 
If 
I 

didn’t 
know 

what that entailed before, the rest 
of my acceptance letter laid it out 
clearly. I wasn’t “simply being 
offered a place in a college,” as the 
admissions office put it; rather, 
I was joining a community full 
of people “making a difference 
everywhere in the world.” I was 
joining the Leaders and Best.

After my first year in Ann 

Arbor, I can truthfully say that 
the letter did not exaggerate. My 
freshman year was spent living in 
West Quad — the same dormitory 
that James Earl Jones and Gov. 
Rick Snyder called home when 
they were students. I took a class 
in the Ford School of Public Policy, 
named after former president and 
fellow Wolverine, Gerald R. Ford. 
I attended a lecture by the former 
CEO of Twitter and University 
of Michigan alum, Dick Costolo 
— and then personally asked him 
a question afterward. And I am 
fortunate enough to have the 
opportunity to write for the same 
student newspaper that Thomas 
Dewey, Sanjay Gupta and Arthur 
Miller contributed to during their 
time as Michigan students.

However, the pressure to succeed 

at that level — to truly become one 
of the Leaders and Best — can be 
overwhelming 
at 
times. 
While 

the atmosphere at this university 
(at least inside the classroom) 
is often more competitive than 
collaborative, 
competition 

tends to breed excellence, right? 
Competition also breeds unwanted 
side effects, though — including, 
but not limited to, the unsolicited 
byproducts of a poor-quality-of-
living and high-stress lifestyle. And 
allowing those byproducts to take 
over your life often comes at the 
expense of your academic success.

During 
my 
freshman 
year, 

especially in the fall, most of 
my closest friends were either 
in the College of Engineering or 
enrolled in STEM-related majors. 
As a result, I often found myself 
comparing my schedule to theirs. 
“Am I taking classes that are too 
easy?” or “Maybe my major won’t 
make me enough money” are two 
common thoughts that plagued 
me throughout the semester. As a 
result, I enrolled in courses that 
I knew I wouldn’t enjoy and, of 
course, didn’t end up enjoying — all 
because I feared I was not achieving 
at the same level as my peers.

Consequently, 
my 
grades 

suffered. It’s little wonder I did 
well in the classes I liked and 
poorly in those I didn’t. I had a 
false conception that the only way 
to become one of the Leaders and 
Best was to push myself tirelessly 
in classes I hated. This revealed 

a bigger flaw in my mindset — I 
assumed that there were only a 
few rigid paths to reaching success. 
While there’s something to be said 
about stepping outside of your 
comfort zone, there is a fine line 
between expanding your horizons 
by exploring untapped interests 
and being constantly stressed about 
work you dread doing.

One of my biggest lessons 

from my first year was that I 
can be successful in whatever 
field I choose, as long as I try 
my best. Despite the competitive 
atmosphere that the University 
sometimes produces, I shouldn’t 
adjust my plans for anyone but 
myself, and neither should you. 
Michigan produces the Leaders 
and Best because it excels in 
almost every field across the 
academic 
and 
professional 

spectrum — from engineering 
to history and from business to 
biology. Almost all of the alumni 
“Leaders and Best” forged their 
own paths to reach the places 
they did, which is an important 
fact to remember when you catch 
yourself 
comparing 
yourself 

to your peers. I promise if you 
don’t forget that, and if you 
plan your class schedule and 
extracurriculars with that in 
mind, the University will be a 
much less competitive place and 
a much more enjoyable place.

5A — Tuesday, September 6, 2016

Dear Mainstream,

You have seen my thighs 

dangle out from under my 
shorts and my skirts. They 
jiggle, they flap and cause 
problems whenever I try on 
something new. It’s a little 
difficult to learn how to love 
every inch of my body fat when I 
go into a store — take your pick, 
H&M or Forever 21 — and have 
difficulty buying shorts. All of 
a sudden my regularly size six 
thighs can’t fit into your size 10 
shorts. That’s a problem. Oh, my 
beautiful thick thighs — I put so 
much onto you that it always 
leaves behind lines and marks 
from the jeans I force onto you 
each day. Mainstream, I love 
my rolls, the rolls that roll over 
my size six pants — but do you? 
Why don’t you see the beauty 
behind my curves and my rolls? 
I never see my reflection on 
any of those websites when I’m 
shopping online. I’ve rarely met 
someone who looks like those 
size small, 5’10” models, with 
a small bust and a small waist. 
You deceive us, making us think 
those clothes will fit just like 
they do on the models, but they 
don’t. Are they ever tried on by 
someone who was larger than 
a small? You imagine all of us 
to be the same, and you expect 
for us to change until we are. 
Mainstream, you don’t allow 
for individuality, and you’re 
so quick to deem someone’s 
body out of the norm, to be 
plus-sized. Why is plus size a 
different section in general? 
You choose every chance you 
get to embarrass my big black 
thighs, forcing me to go to the 
plus size section when you can 
easily extend the sizes into your 
regular 
lines. 
Mainstream, 

learn to love and accept my 
body for what it is. What you 
see as imperfections I see as 
uniqueness.

Mainstream, 
you 
have 

taken away my uniqueness 
by manipulating my nanas, 
aunties 
and 
mommas 
for 

years. For so long, I was told 
that I had to tame my hair and 
make it look “presentable,” all 
the while damaging my hair. 
My hair, oh my hair, it’s been 
pinched and bobbled, robbed 
of its texture and all. It’s been 
strained, lost, shortened and 
almost completely uprooted. 
For years, my hair follicles have 

endured 
chemically-induced 

pain. Sitting there for what 
feels like years, being permed 
and 
burned, 
permed 
and 

burned, permed and burned. I 
constantly complainied from 
the pain only to be reminded 
that “beauty is pain.” Why does 
it have to hurt to be beautiful? 
Mainstream, you’re the one 
who told our mommas to scold 
us in the morning if we didn’t 
wrap our hair the night before, 
always making sure that our 
hair would be neat. We’ve been 
placed in a bubble where we 
would rather spend the money 
to look good then spend the 
time to be true to ourselves. 
Mainstream, you are a catalyst 
for change — to make everyone 
look just like you. You have 
beaten into the heads of my 
nanas, aunties and mommas 
that the natural curl coming 
straight from my scalp shouldn’t 
be there. You have convinced 
many of them that the hair we 
are blessed with is not okay, 
forcing us to assimilate to 
straight long hair just so we are 
not looked at as beneath the rest 
of mainstream. How I choose to 
wear my hair is my prerogative. 
I want to see my natural curls 
back. I want to walk into a job 
interview with the curls that 
sprout from my head and not 
worry about whether or not 
my qualifications are the only 
thing in consideration for the 
job. I’m slowly having to prove 
to those who come before me 
that it’s okay to wear my hair in 
its natural state. Mainstream, 
accept me and my natural afro 
of curls, just like we’ve had 
to accept everything else that 
you’ve thrashed in our faces.

Accept my skin, embrace it 

— it’s not going anywhere. I am 
born and proud of my smooth 
cocoa skin — my beautiful 
chocolate skin that reminds you 
of filth, that you describe as dirt. 
Mainstream, you set aside my 
skin color as if it’s removable. 
We are not seen as an entity 
that needs representation. You 
were in my friend’s head when 
she thought her only option 
was to bleach her beautiful 
skin — her beautiful chocolate 
brown skin. Mainstream, you 
tell my sisters and me that we 
will be accepted if we look just 
like you, if we try to match you 
as best we can. There’s a divide 
between me and my lighter-
skinned sisters. Mainstream, 
do you only wish to inflict 

pain on me and my sisters? Do 
you know how difficult it is to 
look in the mirror and never 
see the image reflected back 
at you in media? Mainstream, 
do you hear from your nanas, 
aunties and mommas that you 
need to date someone with 
lighter skin so that your babies 
will have lighter skin so that 
your baby will be considered 
beautiful based upon her skin 
color? Mainstream, if you could 
change your skin color, would 
you be chocolate? No. You would 
rather just take everything else 
about black women and claim it 
as your own.

My lips, oh my lips, I was 

born with these luscious, full 
and round lips. They were not 
manufactured — just au natural. 
You constantly tore down my 
sisters for their lips and used 
it as a way to emasculate my 
brothers. “Big lips” are equated 
with 
ugliness, 
mainstream, 

except when it comes to today’s 
reality stars. We embrace many 
reality stars as if their newfound 
interest in having big lips make 
them look better when that 
same amount of tissue in my 
lips is deemed unattractive. 
These are the same lips I use 
to mindfully obey your every 
whim, 
policing 
my 
sisters 

about their hair expression and 
reminding our brothers that 
assimilation is the only way to 
get ahead — all of that to finally 
have my lips deemed “cool.” My 
grandmother actually tried to 
teach me ways to make my lips 
look smaller based on the type 
of makeup that I used.

There’s only so much about 

my appearance and my body 
that I can continue to take from 
you, so I’ve decided to take it all 
back. No longer will I look to 
you for justification. If you will 
not represent my beautiful body 
and everything that comes 
along with it, then I’ll find or 
create a space that will. If you 
refuse to recognize the part 
of your current culture that 
takes parts of the culture that 
I’ve had for years, I will shame 
you for it. Mainstream, if you 
continue to purposely tear me 
and my sisters down, remember 
that we’ll always keep rising up.

Sincerely,

The Conventional Black Girl

(Nguyen Dai Duong)

Adam is 4 years old. He is very 

healthy and very happy. He is 
just over 3 feet tall and weighs 30 
pounds.

Adam is very athletic. He 

loves to run, jump, ride his bike,

We are lucky to have such a 

wonderful and loving son. We love 
him very much.

James and Terri Brodnax

The following is a letter I 

penned to my “other” self, the one 
that would have grown up in the 
backcountry of North Vietnam, 
in the style of the annual report 
sent by my adoptive parents to 
my biological parents.

Dear Nguyen Dai Duong

Adam is now 21 years old, 

weighs 117 pounds and is 62 inches 
tall. He is happy and healthy.

Adam has grown up in an 

American household. He has 
two beautiful siblings and loving 
parents. He lives with his mother, 
sees his father and doesn’t speak 
with his stepfather. He goes 

to college in Michigan and is 
currently studying business. He 
enjoys learning in school and has 
incredible friends and mentors in 
his life. Adam’s favorite things are 
helping others, socializing with his 
friends, being active, hiking and 
cheering on Michigan athletics.

Adam has made a lot of 

American friends. Adam has 
always wanted to be normal. He 
has found it relatively easy to find 
friends but has never really felt 
like he fit in. In high school, he 
always questioned why his friends 
had to group up and why his body 
was welcomed with one group 
while his soul fit in with the other.

His soul is every bit American. 

He responds to Adam Brodnax 
and speaks English very well. 
Growing up, he spent Sundays 
watching the Dallas Cowboys 
and Houston Texans. He did 
gymnastics 
for 
most 
of 
his 

childhood, learned the trumpet 
and played Little League baseball. 
He inherited old family recipes 
such as Grandma Sue’s potato 
salad and Mom’s pot roast. His 
family tree tells him that he came 
from a mix of European countries 
that migrated to America roughly 
three generations ago. He grew 
up listening to popular hits of the 
2000s such as Britney Spears and 
Santana. In school, he learned 
about 
Texas 
and 
American 

history but hardly learned much 
about himself. He says “y’all” 
and “howdy” while being mindful 
to hold the door open for others. 
His soul fit in well with his white 
friends, until he started wearing 
polos and Sperrys and realized 
he just couldn’t pull them off. His 
soul is every bit American.

His body is every bit your body 

and an open mystery. He doesn’t 

have pictures of his family, but 
he knows that they and his four 
other biological siblings were 
deathly ill. He is treated as an 
Asian American, expected to be 
smart and submissive, and he is 
often times mistaken for being 
Chinese. He is average height in 
Southeast Asia but is very small in 
America. During Texas summers, 
his body is blessed to have your 
skin. He has had his DNA sampled 
hoping to find family, only to find 
a list of diseases he is susceptible 
to. His body fit in quite well with 
his Asian friends in school until he 
went into their houses and didn’t 
take his shoes off. His body is 
every bit your body.

However, Adam is so very 

optimistic. He has put in time to 
learn about the hardships that 
he could have gone through. He 
knows very well that if he had 
survived the sickness in his family, 
his potential would have been 
limited to harvesting rice in the 
backcountry of Vietnam. Coupling 
the hardships with the sickness 
in your and his family, the odds 
are improbable that he will ever 
meet them. Yet, from listening to 
the success stories of the many 
adoptees who have done this, their 
odds weren’t much better than his.

Adam is lucky to have such a 

beautiful and loving family. He 
knows that he must make the most 
of his life in America for you. He 
takes every opportunity he has 
because he knows that you would 
never get that chance. His future 
is bright because his families 
have given up so much to help 
him along the way. He knows 
that he can read everything he 
can about Vietnam and hang out 
with Vietnamese friends, but he 
also knows that’ll never suffice. 

His soul feels misaligned and 
trapped inside the body that you 
gave him. He knows that you and 
he couldn’t coexist, but losing you 
has left him never quite feeling 
full. Learning to love a body he 
has trouble speaking to has kept 
him unsteady, but he knows his 
parents have shown him what 
unconditional love is. He knows 
that happy endings are hardly 
afforded, but the slim chance 
brings him the strength to find 
your story.

Yours with all the love I have,

Adam Yeager Brodnax

Before college, I had hardly 

talked 
about 
my 
adoption 

process with anyone. It didn’t 
start until I took intergroup 
relations during my freshman 
year. Sitting in that class, I read 
aloud my testimony about my 
upbringing. In the middle of it, I 
began to choke up reading about 
my biological family because it 
was the first time I had openly 
confronted that part of my 
life. Since then, I have had this 
urgency to make sense of my 
adoption process. I understand 
how singular it is that I have 
a life in America, and that has 
pushed me to connect the life I 
lost with the life I gained.

I was adopted when I had 

only logged 179 days. I come 
from a family of seven in rural 
North Vietnam. My siblings 
ranged from being 4 to 15 years 
older than me. My dad worked 
in the rice fields during the day 
with my older siblings while my 
mom kept to the house with the 
younger siblings. My family was 
ridden with tuberculosis and it 

seemed that they were afraid I 
would get it too.

My adopted family consists of 

my two American parents and 
two siblings. My brother was 
adopted from two legally blind 
parents a year before me from the 
same village. Five years later, my 
younger sister would be adopted 
from a young couple in central 
Vietnam. Digging through my 
adoption file, I realized the 
life I lost in Vietnam remains a 
scattered mystery.

I was afforded the opportunity 

to live the American dream that 
so many others sacrifice their 
lives for. Growing up, I benefitted 
from having a typical American 
upbringing — stable, suburban, 
white, middle class. Yet going 
through my adolescent years, I 
was constantly being exposed 
to these Asian-American lived 
experiences my white American 
parents just didn’t know how 
to handle. At my elementary 
school, people would ask, “Are 
you Chinese?” When my mom 
picked me up, the teacher would 
be hesitant to let me in the car. 
When I spent time with my 
grandpa, he warned me to leave 
“North” out of “North Vietnam” 
to 
protect 
me 
from 
being 

stigmatized by his old Navy 
friends. I was called several 
names 
— 
banana, 
Twinkie, 

whitewashed. 
Vietnamese 

barbers knew precisely how 
to handle my hair, but I never 
knew how to tell them what I 
wanted — I still don’t. These 
experiences would continue to 
shape my identity as a transracial 
adoptee that I still find difficult 
to articulate.

Through high school, I held 

onto the ideal that I would 

continue 
to 
grow 
toward 

normalcy. I hoped that I would 
find my space in society because 
all my friends eventually found 
theirs. The typical narrative 
about not fitting into either 
group took form, but instead 
of choosing between my Asian 
friends and my white friends, I 
was forced into this gray area in 
a world painted black and white. 
My soul and body never aligned 
like I expected, leaving both 
parts of me facing the same foggy 
reality together. 

One of the important values 

I’ve learned growing up is that 
hope is something powerful to 
hold on to. It’s hard. It’s hard to 
wrap my mind around what hope 
means to me. But as I keep my 
head above the water, I continue 
to define what it means. For now, 
it means that I just want to be 
sure of myself. I see so many of my 
friends being sure of themselves 
and I happily celebrate that, but I 
have always celebrated for them, 
never with them. I’ve never been 
sure of myself and I hope that 
this piece will help me do that. 
I am still on this journey, sifting 
through my adoption file trying 
to find answers about me. This 
past summer, I learned that I 
might not even be the right baby 
and that’s ok. I’ve found refuge 
in that everything that makes me 
who I am is because of my loving 
adopted parents and siblings. 
This journey is very much alive, 
and I am navigating through it 
with the hope and conviction 
that my soul and body will find 
harmony.

Life Lost, Life Gained

ADAM BRODNAX | CONTRIBUTION

I 

was born weighing two pounds, 
two ounces — three months 

premature. 
I’ve 
been 

told I need 
more 
meat 

on 
my 

bones 
my 

whole 
life, 

probably 
even before 
I 
can 

remember.

My 

weight 
didn’t 
bother me as a child. I didn’t 
see myself as different from my 
classmates, and the time where 
I could’ve been influenced by 
television was spent playing sports. 
I thought I was normal-sized. That 
perspective changed leading up to 
middle school, when media begins 
to make children doubt themselves, 
leading to tweens pointing out 
flaws in each other’s awkward-
stage bodies.

I 
can 
remember 
the 
first 

moment when I wanted to be in 
skin other than my own. I was 
playing Madden 2005 — I would 
have been around 9 years old and 
in fourth grade. I loved creating 
myself as a player on teams I 
created with the best, most cost-
effective players available from 
a fantasy draft before the season 
started. I would be the quarterback 
and lead the fictional Desperados 
to a Super Bowl victory. I tried to 
make my player as much like myself 
as possible at first, matching skin 
tone, hair and equipment I would 
have liked to wear to make myself 
look as cool as possible if I played 
football. One thing I obviously 
couldn’t match was my weight.

I weighed about 80 pounds then, 

and the minimum weight you could 
make a player was twice my size. 
But I didn’t make myself weigh as 
little as possible to be as accurate 
as I could. I augmented the virtual 
character’s biceps to be the size of 
watermelons. I fantasized that in 
this virtual world he, really I, was 

feared by everybody in the NFL, 
wasn’t doubted by anyone as the 
strongest man and got any woman 
he wanted.

I didn’t love my body, and I began 

to realize how much I really didn’t 
as I got older. I struggled to gain 
weight — probably because I was so 
active playing tennis and baseball, 
and playing in the marching band, 
all of which kept me fit and skinny. 
My metabolism was also too fast 
for my own liking, but I’ll probably 
be wishing that it still was lighting 
quick when I’m 40. I was told that 
I couldn’t protect my girlfriends 
because I weighed less than them. 
I lagged behind in the weightlifting 
sessions during freshman gym 
because I struggled to bench just 
the bar. And television added the 
icing on the cake with fake and real 
images of the perfect man — the 
man that it seemed all men wanted 
to be, and the one women wanted — 
an Adonis with bulging shoulders 
and six-pack abs.

Women 
have 
been 
facing 

exploitation because of their bodies 
and unrealistic standards all of their 
lives. Think Barbie, supermodels 
and pop stars. Though their bodies 
are not nearly as sexualized and 
exploited as women’s bodies, men 
face pressure and body shaming 
as well, even though it may not be 
as easy to spot. Think bulked-up 
action figures and weightlifters on 
the covers of magazines and reality 
television. For both sexes, images 
are touched up so models look more 
“perfect.” Women are made to look 
skinnier and men are made to look 
more muscular.

Looking at these pictures, I 

realize I will never be able to attain 
the physique that is deemed the 
ideal, dreamed-about man. Even 
as I continue to work out more 
frequently and gain more muscle 
than I ever have before, I’ll never 
look as good as the dude on the 
cover of Men’s Health. Because 
of my weight compared to an 
extremely muscular body, I have 
dealt with the lies people tell — 
that I’m not enough of a man, not 

attractive enough and that people 
won’t take me seriously because of 
how skinny I am.

But I want to encourage my 

fellow skinny guys to love their 
bodies the best they can. You can 
strive for whatever physique you 
want, but it shouldn’t be forced 
upon you. We, especially younger 
skinny boys, need help in the 
media. An idea I like is how the 
women’s retailer Aerie decided 
back in 2014 not to use touched-up 
models, using women of different 
body types to model its clothing. I 
don’t know how this would look for 
men, but a start may be not using 
touched-up images anymore or 
at least revealing the truth to the 
public so we will not believe the 
majority of the pictures we see are 
real.

Yes, 
good-looking, 
muscular 

men can still be ogled over and 
should be allowed to feel good 
about themselves, but everyone 
shouldn’t 
be 
pushed 
to 
that 

standard, whether it means losing 
pounds or putting more on. Trust 
me: Every time I am told to do that, 
I say, “I’m trying to.” It’s possible 
that your brothers, friends and 
boyfriends are facing the same 
thing. Just like some women may 
face the struggle and pressure 
of losing weight to gain a skinny 
“model body,” men face that tension 
just to gain muscle. This needs to be 
recognized because, far too often, 
this body shaming of less-than-
perfect male physiques is looked 
over. Men should not be expected 
to “take it on the chin” and move on 
or act like people teasing their body 
doesn’t warrant feeling insecure. I 
know it from experience. It’s hard 
to block out all the noise and voices 
selling drugs to help you get more 
jacked.

So 
to 
combat 
unreachable 

standards and my anxieties, instead 
of envying a desirable before and 
after picture, I’m making my own.

OPINION


For more than 30 years, Bell’s 

Pizza stood at 700 Packard St. 
serving slices to students and 
residents alike. Now, a Domino’s 
Pizza will take its place — the 
first iteration of the franchise 
the University of Michigan’s 
Central Campus.

The new restaurant will 

feature bicycle delivery and an 
entirely new open floor plan 
with a “pizza theater” where 
customers can watch their food 
being made.

David Cesarini, the franchise 

owner of the new location, also 
owns three other Ann Arbor 
locations. He said he hopes to 
improve the process of getting 
food to students, and since the 
new store is within walking 
distance of campus.

Cesarini said he searched 

for a few years to find a 
location for the franchise on 
Central Campus. Other pizza 
establishments 
near 
that 

intersection 
include 
Pizza 

Bob’s, Cottage Inn and Happy’s 
Pizza.

“Finding real estate in Ann 

Arbor, especially in the city 
itself, is really difficult,” he said. 
“This location of course is ideal 
because it gives me a chance 
to better service the high 
concentration of customers that 
I currently serve in my other 

two spots.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Drew 

Macleod said he is glad there 
are more restaurants opening 
on Central Campus.

“I like that Central Campus is 

adding new options,” Macleod 
said. “It will definitely make 
me weigh other options before 
getting 
the 
classic 
Quickie 

Burger or Pizza House.”

Cesarini said once Bell’s 

Pizza decided not to renew its 
lease, he was able to work out 
a deal with the landlord before 
the property was even listed. He 
said he hopes to have the store 
up and running by October, 
which he added is one of the 
reasons he thinks he was able 
acquire the property.

“What I think sold him (the 

landloard) is the amount of 
resources and investment we’re 
going to make in this property,” 
Cesarini said. “It’s not going to 
look like anything you see right 
now.”

The 
foundation 
of 
the 

building will remain the same, 
but the roof will be new and 
glass will be added on the sides 
of the walls. Cesarini hopes 
the new design and upgraded 
technology 
will 
make 
the 

process of getting pizza easier.

He also plans to streamline 

the 
delivery 
process 
by 

delivering food on bikes, which 
Cesarini said he believes will 
mean employing more students, 
many of whom are only able to 

deliver by bike.

“We want to be cutting edge,” 

Cesarini said. “We want to find 
ways to work better with the 
community. We want to invite 
our customers to be a part of the 
process.”

He 
also 
noted 
that 
the 

restaurant 
could 
serve 
the 

University’s 
philanthropy 

efforts. Domino’s sponsors clubs 
such as Dance Marathon and 
some Greek life organizations.

“I’m very heavily involved 

with 
the 
University 
and 

students,” he said. “I think 
I’ve donated tens of thousands 
of pizzas over the years. I 

now basically have a campus 
headquarters downtown.”

With the addition of the 

“pizza 
theater,” 
Cesarini 

said the staff wants to make 
customers feel welcome and 
a part of the pizza-making 
process. He expects that this 
interactive environment, late 
hours and a mobile application 
should make Domino’s a simple, 
fun place for students to eat.

Macleod 
said 
normally 

ordering a pizza on Central 
Campus can take an hour, and 
added that he would be open to 
new ways of ordering if it makes 
the process faster.

“An app would make ordering 

a lot more convenient than 
online or calling,” Macleod said.

Cesarini said he hopes to 

embrace both technology and 
student needs as the business 
approaches its opening.

“Domino’s is on the front edge 

of technology and interacting 
with our customers,” Cesarini 
said. 
“The 
University 
of 

Michigan embraces technology, 
so we’re doing the same, and 
I think it’s a great match of 
combining what we’re going to 
offer and what I feel the campus 
and the students already want 
and like.”

New pizzeria to feature bicycle delivery service and “pizza theater”

On a cloudy Thursday, students, 

parents and staff gathered for 
block M cookies, ice cream and 
other refreshments at University of 
Michigan President Mark Schlissel’s 
annual open house, hosted at his 
home on South University.

Before the doors opened, a small 

crowd of students could be seen 
waiting outside the house, including 
LSA freshman Mackenzie Cosand, 
who came with her hallmates from 
East Quad.

“People said it was a good idea to 

come,” she said.

Other groups of freshmen at 

the event echoed Cosand, saying 
they didn’t know much about the 
president, but were just hoping to 
meet new people and catch a glimpse 
of Schlissel.

Schlissel opened his house for 

the first time at the start of the 2014 
academic year, his first year as U of 
M president. The tradition of hosting 
an annual welcome event began in 
the 1930s, when wife of the seventh 
president of the University hosted 
tea parties for women of the college.

to finish the game with 232. 

Speight, meanwhile, rebounded 
impressively by throwing for 145 
yards and three touchdowns, 
leading 
the 
seventh-ranked 

Wolverines to a 63-3 victory in 
their season opener.

The 
first-time 
starting 

quarterback — who beat out 
redshirt juniors John O’Korn and 
Shane Morris to win the starting 
job in his redshirt sophomore 
season — showed poise after his 
early mistake, finding sophomore 
wide receiver Grant Perry for a 
12-yard touchdown on his first 
drive. Fifth-year senior Amara 
Darboh and senior tight end Jake 
Butt also found the end zone for 
Michigan in the first quarter.

After players and coaches spoke 

for weeks about how grueling fall 
camp has been, the Wolverines 
took full advantage of their first 
chance to reap the rewards of 
their hard work.

“Our coaches have worked 

this group of players as hard as 
you possibly can,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “And our 
players worked themselves as 
hard as they possibly could. It just 
hit me Thursday (or) Friday that 
it’s time to just let them go show 

what they can do. I thought it 
would be good, and it was.”

Freshman running back Chris 

Evans electrified the sold-out 
crowd by putting on a display of 
pure speed in his collegiate debut. 
Evans dove into the end zone for 
an 18-yard score in the first half 
and later turned on the jets for a 
43-yard touchdown up the middle 
only a minute into the second. He 
finished with eight carries for 112 
yards and two touchdowns.

The contest also marked the 

debut for 16 other true freshmen, 
including defensive end Rashan 
Gary and offensive linemen Ben 
Bredeson and Michael Onwenu. 
Other than Evans, it might have 
been freshman wide receiver 
Eddie McDoom who stole the 
show, 
with 
two 
impressive 

end-around runs and a leaping 
catch 
that 
had 
fans 
yelling 

“McDOOOOOOM.”

“It’s been coming for weeks 

now,” Harbaugh said. “Three 
weeks ago, it was eight — seven to 
eight (freshmen) that had really 
earned it and knew that they 
were gonna be tracking to be in 
the two-deep (depth chart). Less 
than a week later, maybe it was 
gonna be 10. Another week, it was 
up again and up again. ... They’ve 
earned it.”

Michigan’s second- and third-

string offenses fared just as well 

toward the end of the game, with 
O’Korn and Morris each leading 
touchdown drives and combining 
to go 7-for-7 passing. According 
to Harbaugh, it was an indicator 
of just how close the quarterback 
competition was.

“It’s one of those clichés you 

hear about: if you have three 
good quarterbacks, then you don’t 
have any good quarterbacks,” 
Harbaugh said. “That’s never 
resonated with me. … They’re 
pushing 
each 
other 
higher, 

they’ve all commented how good 
that’s been, and I think that 
showed today.”

On the other side of the ball, 

the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
ran 

roughshod over the Rainbow 
Warriors on nearly every drive, 
picking up four sacks and 10 
tackles for loss. Hawaii didn’t 
gain a first down until the last 
five minutes of the first half, and 
both senior cornerback Channing 
Stribling and senior safety Delano 
Hill picked off quarterback Ikaika 
Woolsey for touchdown returns.

The Rainbow Warriors did put 

together one solid drive to close 
the first half, but an intentional 
grounding penalty resulted in a 
10-second runoff that ended the 
half before Hawaii could attempt 
a field goal. It would eventually 
avenge that failure with a 55-yard 
boot 
from 
kicker 
Rigoberto 

Sanchez with 12:30 remaining in 
the game, but it was far too little, 
far too late.

After Speight’s interception — 

really the only moment of tension 
all afternoon — the Wolverines 
enjoyed 
a 
near-perfect 
first 

performance, 
dominating 
in 

every facet of the game.

“You never want to come out 

and struggle in your first game,” 
said junior center Mason Cole. 
“To be able to go out and run 
the ball well, pass the ball well, 
protect the quarterback well, play 
defense well — put it all together 
and that’s what happens, you go 
up 63 to 3.”

NOTE: All-American senior 

cornerback Jourdan Lewis, fifth-
year senior offensive lineman 
Ben Braden and redshirt junior 
Maurice Hurst were among a 
group of Wolverines that dressed 
but missed the game due to injury, 
with 
Harbaugh 
later 
saying 

that the three were held out as 
a precaution and could be back 
as soon as next week. Senior 
defensive end Taco Charlton 
(ankle), 
senior 
running 
back 

De’Veon Smith (ribs) and redshirt 
sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Bryan Mone (unspecified) all left 
the game due to injury — Smith 
told Harbaugh he was fine, while 
Charlton and Mone will require 
further evaluation.

On Thursday, the line to

the house and continued past 
the entrance of the house onto

Aside from freshmen, many

Our bodies, our 
‘Blonde’ selves

L

yrically, “Here, There and 
Everywhere,” off Revolver, 
is the most physically 

immediate and intimate song 
The Beatles ever recorded. Over 
quiet, calm-
ing guitar 
strums and 
girl-group 
backing 
vocals from 
his band-
mates, Paul 
McCartney 
sings lines 
like “to love 
her is to need 
her every-
where” and “watching her eyes 
and hoping I’m always there” in 
the calmest, sweetest voice. But 
as tranquil as he sounds, there’s 
almost unbearable pain in a 
desire that tangible and deep. On 
Frank Ocean’s latest album, the 
long-awaited Blonde, the young 
singer picks up and intensifies 
that unique kind of pain of being 
human, creating a record as 
purely honest as it is difficult to 
hear.

“Here, There and Every-

where,” which Ocean explicitly 
references on the song “White 
Ferrari,” is a moment that brings 
the old Beatles back for a few 
minutes — a very down to earth, 
physical human feeling on an 
album more often interested in 
altering consciousness and tran-
scending everyday life. While 
they had dipped their toes into 
the mind/body divide with their 
previous record Rubber Soul, 
Revolver is the first that really 
fractures The Beatles. It presents 
them as more than just a physical 
entity, using studio experimenta-
tion to add to the band’s mystique 
and make tangible their visions 

and hallucinations, as well as cre-
ating songs that would be physi-
cally impossible for a four-piece 
group to perform live.

Revolver is a good album to 

listen to when you hate the way 
you take up space in the world. 
It’s a stereotypical go-to for when 
you’re high, but more than that, 
it’s truly a reimagining of what 
music can be. It’s one of the first 
rock albums to break the rules 
of commercial music, to be a 
cohesive work of art more than a 
product or collection of would-be 
radio hits. And while that may 
sound boring, Revolver is actu-
ally playful 
and fun, filled 
with the thrill 
of newness 
and explora-
tion. Its sound 
makes you 
dream beyond 
and smile 
through your 
tangible self.

The 

sequencing 
of Revolver is wickedly smart, 
because as powerful as “Here, 
There and Everywhere” is, you 
get about four seconds of silence 
to process all its difficult mean-
ings and implications before 
Ringo Starr barges through the 
door of your mind without even 
knocking: In the towwwwwwn, 
where I was born … and suddenly 
it’s impossible to think, because 
Zooey Deschanel’s favorite Beatle 
is having a party 20,000 leagues 
under the sea.

Blonde, by contrast, doesn’t 

give that relief. It feels the same 
limitations but decides to linger 
on them rather than escape, and 
so it’s an album that is impos-
sible to enjoy when you hate your 

physical presence. Ocean mostly 
eschews drums, the most physi-
cal instrument, in favor of ethe-
real keyboards and not much else. 
Blonde seems to exist best at 3 or 
4 a.m., a time when even the best 
of us might not feel like the world 
as we know it is totally real. It is, 
depending on who you talk to, a 
mature, complex masterpiece or a 
scattered, incomplete work of art 
from an anxious genius.

Either way, I feel this impos-

sible to salve pain inside me when 
I try to listen to Blonde. The slow 
tempos, the ambient background 
synths, the fact that with only the 

subtlest rhythms 
it’s impossible 
to dance to, all 
force you to lis-
ten intently to 
each deliberate 
note. It’s beauti-
ful, but it’s too 
much. I listen to 
Blonde and my 
mouth feels dry, 
I can’t keep my 
hands steady, 

and I worry that my heart will 
stop beating any second.

In “Nikes,” the opening track, 

Ocean meditates in a high-
pitched inhuman voice on the 
tragic deaths of Pimp C, who died 
at 33 from syrup, and Trayvon 
Martin, a Black teenager who 
was murdered at 17. Knowing 
that he could die at any moment, 
knowing that he looked just like 
Trayvon, Ocean detaches from 
the materialistic world and drifts 
through a hook-up, singing “I’m 
not him, but I’ll mean something 
to you.”

There are occasional wry 

moments of humor on Blonde, like 
the end of “Nikes,” where he tells 
the hook-up “You got a room-

Arts

mate, he’ll hear what we do / It’s 
only awkward if you’re fucking 
him too.” But if you’re uncom-
fortable at all with your body or 
your physical existence, it’s an 
intense, unpleasant experience. 
There’s a debt owed to Revolver 
and The Beatles, which Ocean 
acknowledges, but where The 
Fab Four aspire to freedom and 
preach escape, Ocean’s stripped-
down music forces his listeners 
to confront themselves and their 
most personal feelings.

When Blonde 

surprise-
dropped a few 
weeks ago, it 
was a terrible 
time for me 
to hear it. I’ve 
been uncom-
fortable with 
my physical 
self for quite 
a while now, 
and last month 
was a particularly intense time 
for that feeling. I hated the way 
most people saw me, and it left 
me constantly exhausted, alone, 

scared and needing a change. 
I needed art that I could lose 
myself in — representations of 
others that I could disappear 
into, not minimalist music that 
invaded my mind and forced me 
to look inward. Blonde made me 
feel like I was drowning in my 
own anxieties.

Since then, I haven’t tried to 

tackle Blonde unless I’ve felt 100 
percent up to it, and I’ve instead 
tried to get the same, but slightly 
easier, experience out of The 

Beatles. Blonde 
is fascinating 
and important, 
but it hurts. 
Revolver, 
its spiritual 
ancestor, tack-
les its themes 
of bodies and 
the pain of the 
physical and 
the transcen-
dence of life in 

a more bearable, optimistic way.

It’s fitting that Blonde came 

out as the 2016 Summer Olympics 
closed, just as we were wrapping 

our minds around the seem-
ingly impossible physical tasks 
achieved by athletes like Katie 
Ledecky and Simone Biles. Blonde 
recognizes the beauty of life and 
humanity, but it’s also a counter-
point to the beauty of the games 
in Rio, because it knows that just 
having a body can be the most 
painful experience in the world. 
Whether it’s our race, gender or 
sexuality, or anything else, being 
uncomfortable or feeling alone 
because of your own body is a 
nightmare, and the stress of lust 
and loneliness and mortality take 
an awful toll on both the listener 
and Ocean over the course of 
Blonde. Ocean is forcing his fans 
to embrace their true selves, no 
matter how much it might hurt 
and scare us, and to properly 
listen to Blonde, you need to be 
ready to love yourself and feel it 
everywhere.

favorite Beatle (or if you are 

Zooey Deschanel), invite

Stop motion has always been 

heralded as one of the most 
impressive and visually stun-
ning forms of 
animation — if 
done right. Stop

mation 
studio 

Laika 
Enter-

tainment 
has 

met 
and 
sur-

passed 
expec-

tations 
with 

“Kubo and the 
Two Strings,” a 
film that holds 
its own as a breathtaking and 
mesmerizing work of art.

“Kubo and the Two Strings” 

tells the tale of Kubo (Art Parkin-
son, “Game of Thrones”), a young 
boy who embarks on a quest to 
reunite the three pieces of his late 
father’s magical armor to protect 
himself and his family from the 
wrath of a vengeful spirit. Kubo 

possesses the unique and effec-
tive power to create movement 
and energy through the strum of 
his shamisen, a Japanese guitar. 
The film’s big-name cast of char-
acters includes Monkey (Charl-
ize Theron, “Mad Max: Fury 
Road”), Beetle (Matthew McCo-
naughey, “Interstellar”), the Sis-
ters (Rooney Mara, “Carol”), and 
the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes, 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel”). 
The character dynamics are 
entertaining and complicated, 
with enough intrigue to keep a 
viewer engaged. Furthermore, 
familial ties intertwine the char-
acters in a complex web; Kubo’s 
immortal enemies are his grand-
father and two aunts and his ani-
mal hybrid companions turn out 
to be his parents, kept alive by 
magic. Through plot twists and 
an emphasis on loyalty, “Kubo” 
stresses the importance of family 
and love in a genuine and subtle 
fashion.

Another central theme in the 

film is the art of storytelling. 

Kubo is introduced in a scene of 
him captivating a crowd in his vil-
lage with tales of samurai adven-
ture and danger, defining him as a 
master of the spoken word. How-
ever, the movie also shifts from 
utilizing storytelling in the tradi-
tional sense to instead offering it 
as a flexible and powerful ability. 
Storytelling becomes a force that 
highlights the importance of for-
giveness and the malleability of 
someone’s history, as well as how 
their past shapes their character. 
“Kubo and the Two Strings” mas-
terfully retools the traditional 
art of storytelling to shape lives, 
rather than merely entertain.

The film’s central distinctive 

feature is its absolutely incred-
ible animation. Here we see the 
directorial debut and best effort 
yet of Travis Knight, esteemed 
lead animator of the cinematic 
classics “Coraline” and “Para-
Norman.” Knight has really out-
done himself this time, stunning 
with an overwhelming attention 
to detail in both color and move-

ment. To throw out some choice 
adjectives, the film’s animation is 
dynamic, inventive and captivat-
ing, with Kubo’s world artfully 
constructed. The film’s central 
aesthetic motif revolves around 
the Japanese art of origami, with 
gorgeous landscape shots and 
scenery that look and move like 
folded paper. Further, the genius 
of the movie lies in the way Kubo 
manipulates origami to create 
moving objects that appear alive, 
meshing with the paper-esque 
world around him. The film’s end 
battle scene, in which the Moon 
King takes the form of a massive 
koi fish, is one of the most stun-
ning works of animation to hit the 
screen.

“Kubo” is a beautiful homage 

to Japanese culture and mytholo-
gy, drawing on classic themes and 
aesthetics to create a captivating 
story. Both simple and nuanced 
in plot and design, the film is an 
emotional, immersive experience 
that leaves the viewer warm and 
in awe.

BOOK REVIEW
Daily Book Review: 
‘Joe Gould’s Teeth’

By RENNIE PASQUINELLI

For The Daily

It’s not too late to pick up 

a short summer read. And if 
you’re a fan of profiles on eccen-
tric historical 
figures, this is 
certainly 
the 

book for you.

Joe 
Gould 

was a nobody 
with 
connec-

tions. 
His 

family 
name 

carried him further than any 
college degree could. Friends 
with Ezra Pound, E.E. Cum-
mings and other contemporary 
writers and artists of his time, 
Gould was known for his odd-
ball mystique around the liter-
ary community — especially 
around Harlem.

From the beginning of World 

War I to the end of World War 
II, Gould (supposedly) worked 
vigorously on “The Oral History 
of Our Time”: a history of the 
world told through regular 
people’s stories. His friends and 
his work led to a spotlight in 
The New Yorker, an infamous 
profile entitled “Professor Sea 
Gull” by Joseph Mitchell. “The 

Oral History,” however, was 
never published, even after 
Gould’s death in 1957. Many 
have tried to find “The Oral 
History,” but many have failed.

Jill 
Lepore, 
a 
Harvard 

historian and author of “The 
Secret 
History 
of 
Wonder 

Woman,” crafts a short and 
sweet profile on Gould that is 
not only a search for “The Oral 
History,” but also a revealing 
profile on a complete asshole.

“Joe Gould is not a lovable old 

man,” reported The Harvard 
Crimson in an interview with 
Gould. This description of Gould 
is truly an understatement. The 
most difficult part of getting 
through “Joe Gould’s Teeth” 
is 
the 
protagonist’s 
(and, 

simultaneously, 
antagonist’s) 

racism, sexism and relentless 
harassment towards a black 
woman. Gould was a proponent 
of eugenics, believed that the 
black population tainted the 
white population and often 
approached women to ask them 
if they were “gropable.” In a 
“Breaking Bad” fashion, the 
hero of the story became the 
villain. Instead of a progression 
that 
happens 
within 
many 

seasons, 
however, 
Gould 

becomes the villain within a 
matter of pages.

The saving grace of Gould’s 

profile is the discovery and 
inclusion of Augusta Savage, the 
woman he incessantly stalked, 
even when she requested him 
to stop countless amounts of 
times. Lepore’s astute research 
into Savage’s life could have 
been 
another 
book 
itself. 

Savage, an African American 
single mother and well-known 
sculptor, brings to light a 
different kind of celebrity; one 
vastly different from Gould. 
The 
dichotomy 
between 

the two brings diversity in 
character and a break from the 
general unpleasantness that is 
Joe Gould.

“Joe Gould’s Teeth,” though 

short, is difficult to get through. 
Each page is filled with pull-
out-your-hair-worthy 
details 

surrounding 
Gould’s 
blatant 

disrespect for women and black 
people. Lepore is a fantastic 
historian; her intimate details 
make it possible to form a deep 
hatred for the book’s subject. 
This doesn’t necessarily make 
for a bad read, but fair warning: 
your eyes may get stuck in the 
rolled-back position.

F

emale friendship is 
beautiful and entirely 
terrifying. There are 

expectations for friendships to 
be some of the most important 
relationships 
in a woman’s 
life — that 
is, until 
husbands 
and children 
typically take 
over these 
roles. Novels 
and films 
detailing 
the plight of 
the modern 
woman often 
list the dissolution of female 
friendships after marriage 
as concerning, but not overly 
important. Only rarely do cir-
cumstances allow for friends to 
continue to play as influential 
a role as they may have in girl-
hood.

This intense lifelong connec-

tion between two women is the 
center of the Neapolitan nov-
els, the acclaimed work of the 
pseudonymous Italian novelist 
Elena Ferrante. In the four-
part bildungsroman, Ferrante 
details the evolution of a female 
friendship between Elena and 
Lila. Told from the first-person 
perspective of Elena, the story 
reads like the diary of a vicious 
and vulnerable teenage girl. 
After they grow into adulthood 
as best friends, Lila disappears 
without a trace and without 
letting Elena know where 
she’s going. Elena vengefully 
writes their story, juxtaposing 
the intense volatility of Lila’s 
actions with her own normalcy. 
Even when Lila is not physically 
near her, Elena is inextricably 
bound to her best friend, each 
one struggling to define herself 
outside the terms of the other.

The novel is electric, because 

in between the strange instanc-

es specific to a low-income 
neighborhood in Naples exists 
the elements of life that makes 
your heart race — sex, jealousy, 
violence, fireworks. Reading 
Ferrante feels eerily similar to 
the moment when someone asks 
if you can keep a secret. The 
urgency of her words creates a 
bond between reader and author 
that is exceptional and infre-
quent. Ferrante’s description of 
the female experience creates 
an intimacy with the author 
so vivid that the reader feels 
like they know her, or that she 
knows them.

“My Brilliant Friend” pres-

ents as almost confessional, 
with Elena painting an incred-
ibly vivid picture of the life 
of her best friend as an act of 
revenge. But Elena is so deeply 
entrenched in the story of their 
upbringing that Ferrante dif-
ferentiates her work from the 
simplicity of gossip. She puts 
aside the pettiness of the social 
currency that gossip and infor-
mation provide, eschewing the 
values of works like Richard 
Brinsley Sheridan’s 1777 play 
“School for Scandal.” In the play, 
the characters revel in the ten-
sions caused by knowledge and 
scandalous divulgences. But in 
the Neapolitan novels, Ferrante 
concentrates on the substance of 
her characters, watching them 
grow and change rather than 
simply forcing them into differ-
ent situations for reactions.

In a rare interview with 

The New Yorker, Ferrante said 
“writing is an act of pride.” She 
explains that she always wanted 
to hide her work, as writing 
felt presumptuous and shame-
ful. The reader can clearly see 
this reluctance for ostentation 
in Ferrante’s novels — not only 
because she literally hides her 
identity, but because the exi-
gency of her words forces her 
stories out into the open.

Stories like the Neapolitan 

novels, with unafraid first-
person narration and a storyline 
focused on transforming the 
mundane into the extraordi-
nary, are inextricably linked to 
women’s writing. Novels like 
Ferrante’s feel like they conform 
to a strictly gendered style of 
writing. It’s fluid and fast-paced, 
with subtle undertones of con-
flicting emotions. The distinctly 
feminine writing of these books 
lies in their imperative languid-
ness — these stories desperately 
need to be told, but also want to 
be coaxed with encouragement. 
They are complex, unapologeti-
cally requiring the full attention 
of their audience.

There’s been some discus-

sion recently of whether or not 
we should be reading to make 
friends with characters, and the 
role that likability should play 
in literature. Although wielding 
expectations of friendship for 
fictional characters is a flawed 
approach, it is true that we read 
for many of the same reasons as 
the ones for which we pursue 
friendship. We read to connect, 
to recognize the other minds 
that are constantly reverberat-
ing around us. Ferrante’s novels 
especially reject solipsism as 
we look into the lives of others 
who exist with thoughts and 
feelings strikingly similar to 
our own. She takes the friend-
ship between women seriously, 
which is unusual in a place like 
Naples where societal norms 
dictate the prioritization of 
other relationships. Ferrante 
gives space to the complex feel-
ings of these overlooked and 
sometimes neglected relation-
ships, returning meaning and 
power to the bearers of female 
friendship.

E

veryone saw it. A 
six-second video 
on Vine of Michi-

gan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh 
punching 
his new 
starting 
quarter-
back’s pads 
prior to 
him taking 
the field — 
shoulders, 
chest, hips, 
helmet — 
emulating the environment 
he’d likely see this coming 
season.

Harbaugh seems certain 

of a lot of things, like maybe 
how hitting his quarter-
back up and down helps 

him play. He did it prior to 
this quarterback’s game-
winning touchdown drive 
against Minnesota in 2015, 
when he was just a reliever 
for starting quarterback 
Jake Rudock.

Harbaugh knew that it 

had worked before, so he 
was doing it again, pump-
ing up his quarterback for 
his first start of the 2016 
season, in Michigan Sta-
dium against Hawaii.

Since Monday at least, 

Harbaugh knew who would 
start. He knew who had 
won the competition, even 
if no one other than him 
and his quarterback knew.

But he didn’t know that 

redshirt sophomore Wilton 
Speight would throw an 

interception on his first 
play of the season. The 
mental anguish that comes 
with that can’t be emulated 
by a few slaps and punches.

An audible gasp from the 

crowd filled the stadium. 
The stout Michigan defense 
had just forced a three-and-
out in a little over a minute, 
and it was a shock to the 
system to see the offense 
start in such an alarming 
fashion.

Besides, this is the same 

quarterback that claims 
that his perspective started 
to shift after that game in 
Minnesota. He rode that 
confidence boost through 
spring, giving it a great deal 
of credit for his success 
throughout spring camp.

Back on April 1, when it 

was just the Maize play-
ing the Blue in Michigan’s 
annual Spring Game, he 
noted how much it helped 
him.

“(Playing against Minne-

sota last season) was huge,” 
Speight said following the 
Spring Game. “Not that 
you live in the past, you 
never want to do that, but 
to go out there and say that, 
‘Well, I’ve done this on the 
road in a hostile environ-
ment, why can’t I do it in 
Glick (Field House), or 
why can’t I do it in a Spring 
Game, or why can’t I do it 
next year versus Hawaii?’ 
It’s big, and it’s kept me 
calm.”

How would Speight 

bounce back from this, a 
season-opening intercep-
tion? Would it zap his con-
fidence, ultimately zapping 
his season?

He answered in resound-

ing fashion: On the next 
series, he started on the 
two-yard line. His first pass 
was to fifth-year senior 
wide receiver Jehu Ches-
son for 16 yards. One pass 
did what no pass he had 
thrown before had done: It 
instilled confidence in him 
as a starting quarterback, 
and after that, he didn’t 
look back.

“Once I saw my first 

completion to (Chesson) on 
that slant, I felt completely 
settled in and kind of like

GOOD LUCK CHARM

W

hen Warde Manuel 
stepped out of the 
elevator and into the 

press box 
Saturday 
morning at 
Michigan 
Stadium, 
he greeted 
staffers with 
a familiar 
refrain.

“Who’s got 

it better than 
us?” he asked.

It was 

just before 9 a.m. on his first 
game day as Michigan’s athletic 
director, a day that one might 
assume Manuel would get to bask 
in. And it was a big day, just not 
in the way you might expect.

Throughout the day, Manuel 

will draw the attention of a 
celebrity, but his first game 
day morning isn’t especially 
glamorous. He looks over 
paperwork. He visits tailgates and 
plays host. It is not like his first 
home game as a player in 1986.

Oddly enough, he doesn’t 

remember the opponent or 
the score of that game. He 
just knows that his team won. 
(Michigan beat Oregon State, 
31-12, on Sept. 20, 1986.) But 
he remembers clearly what it 
was like to run onto the field 
the first time — a feeling that 
this day, however special, can’t 
possibly recapture.

“There’s nothing that would 

ever compare to running on the 
field the first time as a freshman 
and seeing the 100,000,” Manuel 
said. “The difference is, that 
was the first time I’d ever been 
in the stadium. On this one I’m 
returning. And, while very, very 
special, that first time running on 
the field was — I’ll never forget it.”

Manuel will get down to the 

field Saturday, too, but first, he 
has some things to take care of 
that he never had to as a player. 

Almost immediately after he 
arrives at the press box, he goes 
off to his suite to start looking 
over paperwork.

Each day, he gets a morning 

briefing, and on Saturday it’s 
easy to understand why. He 
moves from place to place 
quickly on this game day, with 
timing and locations subject 
to change. First, though, he 
sits in the athletic director’s 
suite, head buried in his folder, 
joined by his chief of staff, Doug 
Gnodtke, and his guest, James 
Hall, a member of the 1997 
national title team.

There’s plenty of room. 

Manuel sits at one of the two 
counter top tables, in front 
of the two high-tops and the 
kitchenette for food and drinks. 
The shelves conjure some of 
his memories. One has a photo 
of Manuel as a player. Another 

features a small Michigan teddy 
bear and a picture of the moment 
Jim Harbaugh handed him a 
jersey bearing his name at his 
introductory press conference.

These are the subtle 

personalizations in a suite that’s 
not significantly different than 
the standard issue. It’s larger, but 
it wouldn’t be a big deal without 
Manuel in it.

On this morning, he doesn’t 

dwell there long. He has a radio 
interview to do, so he and his 
entourage walk down the hall, 
take the elevator to the ground 
level and start walking toward the 
Pioneer High School tailgates.

Manuel is a large, swaggering 

man, and he’s very easy to 
recognize. Fans holler to 
Manuel and frequently ask for 
pictures. Usually, he hollers back, 
sometimes in kind, others with 
a “Go Blue!” He poses for a lot of 

photos.

At the intersection of Main 

and West Stadium, Manuel 
greets a police officer. He does 
this many times on game day, 
and it stands out. He even asks 
one about his wife and kids. 
Later, Manuel explains that he 
got to know the force through 
the late Vada Murray, a police 
officer and Manuel’s best friend. 
He doesn’t have much spare 
time today, but he still stops 
when he can, nearly always with 
a charismatic greeting.

That’s the nature of his 

Saturday: so little time, so many 
hands to shake and so many 
people to catch up with.

***

Manuel actually beats the 

softball team to its tailgate on 
the grass next to Alumni Field, 

and he teases them about the 
low volleyball net they are using. 
Senior shortstop Abby Ramirez 
justifies it by saying, “It’s my 
height!” Not one to just stand by 
and watch, the athletic director 
joins the game — in his dress 
slacks and blazer, no less — and 
aces his first serve. He misses his 
second short of the net.

Then he moves to play corn 

hole. Manuel is a natural, just as 
he is at the art of conversation. 
He is a people person, and it’s 
remarkable how he’s able to make 
a connection with seemingly 
every person he interacts with. 
He’s right next to the softball 
fields, so it only makes sense that, 
on multiple occasions, he retells 
the story of how he and Murray 
once flooded the field, which he 
also recalled at his introductory 
press conference.

“If they didn’t need our help for 

a few more weeks,” he tells two 
softball players, “I think we would 
have been fired on the spot.”

Then, once more, Manuel 

is on the move, headed to the 
basketball tailgate. As his golf 
cart drives up the sidewalk, 
two young men are sauntering 
by with a case of Labatt Blue 
before they appear to realize who 
they’re carrying it past.

As they motor toward the 

Crisler Center parking lots, 
Manuel, who says he has not yet 
eaten since 5:45 a.m., takes a bite 
of a nutrition bar that he thinks 
is “kale or something.” He hands 
it back to Hall, who declares it 
has no taste. Manuel says it’s 
good with iced coffee. “Hint of 
cardboard,” he says.

As the golf cart moves through 

crowds, Manuel says the cart 
needs a Dukes of Hazzard horn.

Manuel’s next tailgate is on the 

roof of the Player Development 
Center, where Manuel gets to 
chat briefly with point guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. and men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein. 
Nearly all of his remaining time 
there is spent meeting people 
whom it’s his job to meet.

This is where it’s most clear. 

The PDC roof has a beautiful 
view of campus, a perfect setting 
to just sit down and soak in how 
good it must feel to be athletic 
director at his alma mater. But 
Manuel just doesn’t have time 
to bask. Soon, he has to be on 
the field, where two men named 
Michael and Derek will also be.

Then, right before noon, he 

will watch the team run out of 
the tunnel, and maybe he’ll think 
back to his first time doing the 
same nearly 30 years ago. But 
there’s one thing he is sure of.

“I’m not gonna throw up like I 

used to as a player.”

Michigan defense stifles Hawaii

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Before the Michigan football 

team’s season opener against 
Hawaii on Saturday, Channing 
Stribling asked Jourdan Lewis if 
he was OK, and Lewis said yes.

But Lewis had been battling 

an injury in practice leading up 
to the game, and Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh wanted to make 
sure he didn’t rush him back. So 
Harbaugh sat his All-American 
cornerback as a precaution, and 
his defense still delivered an 

electric performance.

“We made sure this season,” 

said senior defensive back Chan-
ning Stribling, “that even though 
somebody goes down, we gotta 
make sure that we keep it going.”

Last year, the Wolverines 

were dominant in several games, 
but most of them came when the 
defense was at full strength and 
playing its best football of the 
season. When defensive tackle 
Ryan Glasgow injured his pec-
toral Nov. 7, and other injuries 
such as defensive end Mario Oje-
mudia’s Achilles began to take 

their toll, the unit faded.

Not Saturday. Despite not 

learning of Lewis’ absence until 
just before game time and not 
practicing without him all week, 
Michigan stifled Hawaii for the 
duration of the afternoon.

The 
Wolverines 
allowed 

just 232 total yards, forced six 
punts and made four sacks. They 
returned two interceptions for 
touchdowns for the first time 
since the 1999 Citrus Bowl.

As it did last year, the defense’s 

pressure best showed in its effect 
on the opposing offense. In the 
first half especially, the Rain-
bow Warriors rushed throws, 
struggled with blocks and faced 
jarring hits. Michigan kicked 
off to start the game and didn’t 
allow Hawaii so much as a posi-
tive play until its third series, a 
first down until its seventh or a 
point until its 10th.

“(Defensive 

coordinator 
Don 
Brown) 

talked to the 
D-line 
(and) 

said, 
‘We’re 

gonna bring a 
lot of pressure 
early, 
making 

sure that this 
quarterback 
is rattled,’ and he got rattled,” 
Stribling said. “Just kept it going 
for the whole game.”

But before long, the defense 

suffered 
even 
more 
attri-

tion. Senior end Taco Charl-
ton and redshirt sophomore 
tackle Bryan Mone, two start-
ing linemen, each went down 
in the second quarter and did 
not return. Reserve defensive 
tackle Maurice Hurst sat out 
the game for the same reason 
Lewis did.

Still, the Wolverines managed 

to rotate eight defensive line-
men with their first team. Still, 
the secondary locked down on 
Hawaii’s passing game.

“Watching our defense go 

through the first half and even 
into the third quarter, there 
wasn’t a mistake made,” Har-
baugh said. “There wasn’t an 
alignment mistake made. … It 

was very impressive. Everybody 
knew exactly what they were 
doing.”

Hawaii — which lost to Cali-

fornia in Sydney last weekend 
and then traveled halfway across 
the world to Ann Arbor with a 
stop at home in between — found 
no relief.

A Michigan interception gave 

the Rainbow Warriors good field 
position, and they moved back-
ward. A long ensuing drive gave 
them some rest, and they went 
three-and-out again. Mone and 
Charlton left the game, and the 
Wolverines had replacements 
for them. Then came the second 
string, and Michigan just kept 
firing fresh bullets from the side-
line. And so on, and so on.

“The D-line’s gonna do their 

job, the linebackers are gonna 
do their job and in the back end 
… we make their job better, and 

then 
they 

make our job 
better,” Strib-
ling said. “So 
a lot of pres-
sure 
equals 

a 
lot 
more 

turnovers; 
a 

lot more turn-
overs equal a 
lot more pres-

sure.”

Stribling had one of the pick-

sixes, atoning for a missed inter-
ception earlier and recovering 
from another that was called 
back for a penalty elsewhere.

Even without Lewis, the Wol-

verines started Stribling and 
three other seniors (Delano Hill, 
Dymonte Thomas and Jeremy 
Clark) in the secondary. Lewis’ 
return will give them a fifth.

And 
Harbaugh 
expects 

the All-American back at full 
strength next week, when he can 
provide one thing Stribling said 
Michigan lacked.

“I think what was missing 

was the trash talk,” Stribling 
said with a smirk. “That was 
missing. (Clark) kind of made up 
for it, but when (Lewis) makes a 
play, you hear him.”

The All-American not com-

pletely replaceable? Go figure.

Evans stars for ‘M’

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

Chris Evans doesn’t like wear-

ing his contacts.

The freshman running back 

only sheds his glasses in games 
because once, in high school, they 
flew out of his helmet when he 
took a hit. He wouldn’t need the 
contacts at all if he weren’t far-
sighted, which is funny because 
on Saturday, Evans was the one 
who must have seemed like a blur 
up close.

Evans ran for 112 yards in 

Michigan’s 63-3 win over Hawaii, 
the most in school history for a 
true freshman running back mak-
ing his debut. All through train-
ing camp, teammates and coaches 
raved about Evans and his ability 
to make plays in space, and Michi-
gan coach Jim Harbaugh said the 
team plans to use Evans in a vari-
ety of ways, including returns and 
as a receiver. Against the Rain-
bow Warriors, it wasn’t hard to 
see why.

“He really can do everything 

you’d want a back to do,” Har-
baugh said. “He blocks. He runs 
the ball between the tackles. He 
can run on the edge. He can catch 
the ball out of the backfield. He’s 
a good contributor on special 
teams as well. There’s a lot of 
ways he’ll be used. He’s a special 
player.”

Evans said he knew he would 

get the ball in the Wolverines’ 
season opener. He just didn’t 
know he would get it quite so 
much. His first carry came on the 
Wolverines’ third drive — though 
it was functionally their second, 
since Wilton Speight threw an 
interception on their first — and 
he took it for seven yards. Then 
Speight gave him the ball again. 
And then again.

By halftime, he already had 

seven carries — the most of any 
Michigan ball carrier — and his 
seventh was his most impressive. 
With the Wolverines leading 28-0 
with just over six minutes left in 
the first half, Evans took a toss 
going left, stiff-armed one tackler, 
shook off another, and dove to the 
pylon for his first college touch-
down.

“It was just crazy,” Evans said. 

“I’ve seen the big house roar, but 
I’ve never seen it roar for me.”

On his next and final carry, he 

needed no such frills. He went 
straight up the middle, untouched, 
for a 43-yard touchdown. There 
wasn’t ever a question of whether 
he was fast — Evans was a star 
hurdler at Ben Davis (Ind.) High 
School — but on this play he just 
shot through the hole. By the time 
he hit the line of scrimmage, three 
Rainbow Warriors appeared to 
have a shot at Evans, and a fourth 
soon threw off a block to join 
them. It just didn’t matter.

Evans split them down the 

middle, leaving one defender 
flat on his stomach after col-
liding with an official and the 
other three hopelessly chasing 
him.

All of this was from a player 

who, when he arrived, felt rela-
tively unknown. Evans didn’t 
carry the hype that Rashan Gary 
or Brandon Peters did, and he 
said he wondered, when he first 
arrived, if he belonged at Michi-
gan.

“After two days of training 

camp, we all knew who Chris 
Evans was,” Speight said.

Now, so does the Michigan 

fan base. And while the Hawaii 
rush defense is far from a reli-
able measuring stick, don’t expect 
Evans to turn shy when stronger 
defenses 
present 
themselves. 

When Michael Jordan spoke to 
the team last night, Evans was the 
first Wolverine to speak up and 
ask Jordan a question about his 
famous “flu game.” 

It says something that the 

freshman didn’t shy away from 
breaking the ice with an all-time 
great athlete. And that confidence 
extended to the football field 
against Hawaii.

“In high school, I was kind of 

like, ‘Oh, I hope he blocks him, 
I hope he blocks him,’ ” Evans 
recalled. “But out there today, I 
was like, ‘All right, I know he’s 
going to block him, I know he’s 
going to block him,’ so it’s really 
on me. It’s really on me to do it 
because I know everything’s 
going to be perfect.”

Saturday, it was close.

Michigan rolls on 
West Coast swing

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

To most teams, two weekends 

of road games against ranked 
opponents would inspire feelings 
of dread. But not the 10th-ranked 
Michigan field hockey team. 

The Wolverines (3-1) defeated 

No. 12 Stanford, 2-1, Friday and 
California-Berkeley, 5-0, Sunday. 
Michigan’s 
victories 
came 

following a 1-0 road victory over 
then-No. 1 UNC, 1-0, and a 2-0 
loss to then-No. 7 Wake Forest last 
weekend.

“I’m really proud of the team 

for playing a full 70 minutes,” said 
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz.

Sophomore 
forward 
Emma 

Way kicked off the scoring for the 
Wolverines against the Cardinal 
when she netted a goal at 23:57, 
while senior forward Courtney 
Enge extended Michigan’s lead 
to two 14 minutes later. The 
Wolverines kept Stanford off the 
board in the first half.

But the Cardinal did not go 

down without a fight.

Stanford 
took 
advantage 

of a penalty corner in the 51st 
minute to get the ball past junior 
goaltender Sam Swenson to cut 
Michigan’s edge in half. 

The Cardinal then appeared 

poised to tie the game when the 
Wolverines were given a green 
card with 3:41 left. But Swenson 
and her teammates successfully 
ran out the clock and ensured the 
victory for Michigan. Swenson 
finished Friday with four saves in 
total.

“I 
think 
we’ve 
worked 

together really well,” Swenson 
said of her teammates. “We’ve 
upped our communication so 
that everyone is on the same 
page. That’s really helped us all 
the way through the team.”

Pankratz gave special praise to 

Swenson, though.

“Swenson 
is 
an 
amazing 

goalkeeper,” Pankratz said. “She’s 
quick, she’s experienced and the 
defense in front of her is really 
confident because of her.”

Against the Golden Bears, 

redshirt junior forward Carly 
Bennett drew first blood when 
she scored at 28:08. The rest of 
the first half featured very little 
offense as the teams combined for 
just three shots on goal.

The Wolverines would change 

that in a big way in the second half.

Senior forward Sina Lampe 

made a shot off a penalty corner 
towards Enge, who put the ball in 
the net in the 55th minute. Bennett 
added another goal two minutes 
later to extend the lead to three.

Freshman 
forward 
Bree 

Bednarski scored her first career 
goal 1:36 later and Enge topped 
things off by notching her third 
goal of the weekend as time 
expired.

“I think we all got extra 

hungry and extra ready for the 
second half,” Enge said. “We just 
penetrated the circle and the goals 
fell.”

Michigan will be rewarded for 

its early success by finally getting 
to play at home against Villanova 
on Sept. 10, something Pankratz 
and the Wolverines are looking 
forward to.

“We’ve been on the road a long 

time and it gets tiring,” Pankratz 
said. “Our players have worked 
really hard, and classes start (this 
week).”

The Wolverines will have 

to face No. 6 Maryland and 
No. 12 Louisville before 2016 
is out. But after the past two 
weekends, Michigan likely won’t 
be walking into those matchups 
feeling dread.

‘M’ dominates Ole Miss

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Editor

At first, Reilly Martin didn’t 

want to take the penalty kick in 
the 39th minute of Friday night’s 
game. 
After 
the 

sophomore 
midfielder 
was taken down inside the box 
by an Ole Miss defender, Martin 
was shaken up and senior 
midfielder 
Jessica 
Heifetz 

stepped forward to finish the 
job with the Michigan women’s 
soccer team clinging to a 1-0 
lead.

That was until head coach 

Greg Ryan called for Martin to 
take it herself, especially since 
she was the player who drew the 
penalty.

Martin stepped forward and 

paused. Three weeks ago on 
Aug. 11, she was in the exact 
spot against the goalkeeper 
from then-No. 4 Virginia, but 
Martin’s attempt ricocheted off 
the left post. This time against 
Ole Miss, though, there was no 
chance she’d let it hit anything 
other than the net.

With her right foot, Martin 

kicked the ball past Rebels 
goalkeeper 
Marnie 
Merritt, 

giving Michigan (3-1-1) a much-
needed insurance goal and an 
eventual 2-0 victory.

“She’s the one kid I know will 

put it in the back of the net,” 
Ryan said. “Great for her to step 
up, and that was the goal that 
put the game away.”

Twenty 
minutes 
earlier, 

redshirt junior forward Ani 
Sarkisian opened the game up 
for Michigan after Martin took 
the ball up the field, drew off a 
defender inside the box and gave 
Sarkisian an open look to spiral 
a shot into the upper 90 for a 
one-goal lead.

The Wolverines knew they 

were 
facing 
a 
high-octane 

offense in Ole Miss, and getting 
on the board early would be the 
difference maker. Much of this 

week’s focus leading up to the 
game was to work on having 
two extra defenders on the ball 
carrier, because Ryan knew that 
his team couldn’t stop the Rebels 
offense one player at a time.

The 
strategy 
worked 
for 

Michigan, which headed into 
halftime with a two-goal lead. 
Luckily for the Wolverines, they 
continued to execute their game 
plan in the second half against 
an Ole Miss squad even hungrier 
to even out the scoring.

“At halftime,” Ryan said, 

“I told them, ‘Hold on, it’s 
coming. They’re going to throw 
everything at ya. We’re gonna 
be defending a lot. Keep your 
shape, keep your composure and 
you’ll be fine.’ ”

Added 
Sarkisian: 
“Second 

half, we didn’t really control the 
tempo as much but they were 
knocking on our door all 45 
minutes and we did a great job of 
just keeping them out of our box 
and defending as a whole unit.”

Three 
minutes 
into 
the 

second half, Ole Miss fired off 
a shot only to have it saved by 
sophomore redshirt goalkeeper 
Sarah 
Jackson. 
The 
Rebels 

placed an extra forward up front 
and brought up most of their 
outside backs, showing how 
eager they were to narrow the 
deficit.

Ole Miss (3-2) fired off just 

four shots in the first half, but 
in the second, the offense came 
alive in a 12-shot onslaught — 
four of which came in the final 
10 minutes of the game.

Jackson made a diving save 

on the final shot from the 
Rebels. Even if Ole Miss had 
scored in those final minutes 
for a one-goal loss instead of 
two, Michigan still wanted the 
shutout. This season, the team’s 
motto is “All In,” meaning they 
have to put in the effort in all 
90 minutes, because letting 
loose for even a few seconds 
could result in a late comeback 
by an opponent — something 
the Wolverines dealt with on 

occasion last season.

With Jackson making nine 

saves 
through 
90 
minutes, 

though, the Rebels efforts were 
thwarted.

“Sarah was very, very sharp 

tonight,” Ryan said. “The thing 
with Sarah is she’s getting really 
confident, and that was a key for 
her, because she’s always had 
the ability and the athleticism, 
and tonight was a perfect game 
for her. She can get to just about 
anything.”

The 
season 
ahead 
is 

promising for the Wolverines 
after they shut out a high-
caliber offensive team ranked 
in the NSCAA top 25 last week. 
With the exception of a loss to 
Marquette, Michigan has made 
the most of its opportunities 
to compete against some of the 
best talent in the country.

And with Big Ten play just 

two weeks away, the Wolverines 
will be that much more prepared 
to begin their journey toward a 
conference title.

Wolverines earn three more wins

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

Holding onto a 3-0 record 

from its season opener, the 
Michigan volleyball team had high 
expectations to deliver the same 
quality performance at the Kansas 
State Invitational. The Wolverines 
didn’t disappoint, as they advanced 
to 6-0 after claiming victories over 
Tennessee State, Kansas State and 
Georgia Tech.

Despite dropping their first 

set of the season against the host 
Wildcats, Michigan rallied for 
a four-set victory, 25-21, 24-26, 
25-19, 25-22. Fifth-year senior 
outside hitter Kelly Murphy 
highlighted the offense with a 
career-high 21 kills and a .455 
attack percentage. Senior middle 
blocker 
Abby 
Cole 
followed 

closely behind with 17 kills and 
a .333 attack percentage. The 
Wolverines totaled 59 kills out 
of 151 total attacks for a .311 total 
attack percentage.

But it was Michigan’s ability to 

avoid mistakes and capitalize on 
strengths that really separated it 
from Kansas 
State.

“We were 

very 
low-

error,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Mark 

Rosen. 
“We 

kept a lot of 
stuff in play, 
and if things 
weren’t 
perfect, we didn’t make them 
worse. We tended to make them 
better. A lot of the time, with the 
teams we played this weekend, 
the difference in score was 
error, because we tried to stay 
pretty clean.”

Michigan’s 
performance 

against 
Georgia 
Tech 
was 

oriented more toward consistency 
and defense rather than offense. 
The Wolverines’ defense only 
allowed Georgia Tech a .094 
attack average while topping the 
Yellow Jackets in four sets, 25-16, 
25-17, 19-25, 25-22. Michigan 
reached a season-high 72 digs, 
along with 12 team blocks.

Cole reached a career-high 

total with nine digs, while 
sophomore libero Jenna Lerg 

recorded a season-high 23.

In the third and final match of 

the invitational, the Wolverines 
tallied 
their 
best 
average 

attack percentage since 2012, a 
.444 against Tennessee State, 
streamlined by redshirt sophomore 
middle blocker Cori Crocker. She 
led the team with 10 kills and 
contributed a .529 attack average.

“We’ve been working with Cori 

to try and develop her offense,” 
Rosen said. “She’s a very good 
blocker and good on the defensive 
side of stuff, but we haven’t really 
been able to utilize her as much 
offensively. In the match against 
Tennessee State, she led in kills 
and and hit over .500, so that was 
a great breakout match for her 
offensively. If we can get her more 
involved offensively, that’s going 
to be a good thing.”

Murphy 
and 
junior 
right-

side hitter Katherine Mahlke 
both contributed offensively as 
well, with seven and nine kills, 
respectively.

Lopsided scores of 25-7 and 

25-14 in favor of Michigan during 
the first two sets allowed some of its 

younger athletes 
experience, 
including 
freshman 
setter Katerina 
Rocafort 
and 

freshman 
outside 
hitter 

Sydney 
Wetterstrom, 
who tallied six 
kills.

“We’re still trying to give people 

opportunities to see how they play 
in games and see what they do in 
practice,” Rosen said. “We track 
that really closely, but we still 
want to see how they respond in 
game situations. Today, when we 
shuffled things around and made 
changes, the level didn’t really 
drop off. In lots of ways, it actually 
improved, and I think that’s a 
great sign of depth.”

If the Wolverines can continue 

to expose their freshmen to the 
offensive mentality they have 
been highlighting, then Michigan 
shouldn’t 
have 
a 
problem 

fielding experience and depth 
at the Panther Invitational next 
weekend — and maybe tack on 
three more wins to their record.

The difference in 
score was error 
... we tried to stay 

pretty clean.”

Michigan busts rust at 
season’s opening meet

Finn runs 

unattached as 

Wolverines kick off 

2016 campaign

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

DEXTER, Mich. — It took 

46.6 seconds for the next com-
petitor to catch up to Erin Finn 
at the 5,000-meter Michigan 
Open, the first race of the sea-
son.

The nonscoring event con-

sisted of 27 athletes, five of 
whom ran unattached. It was 
the first competition setting 
outside of practice for the No. 
9 women’s cross country team, 
which allowed coaches to see 
areas where the runners could 
use work, and help determine 
which individuals would be 
redshirted.

Finn, now in her senior sea-

son, dominated the race as an 
unattached athlete, finishing 
with a time of 16:44. The next 
runner, graduate transfer Kira 
Garry, crossed the finish line at 
17:31.

But, it was junior Avery Even-

son who really impressed coach-
es and spectators at the event. 
After transferring to Michigan 
last year and sitting out the 
season with an injury, Even-
son competed in the Michigan 
Open as her 
first race in 
uniform. She 
finished 
the 

race with a 
time of 17:43, 
and was the 
top attached 
finisher 
for 

Michigan, 
claiming 
third place.

“It was def-

initely a good meet, a nice rust-
buster for everyone,” Evenson 
said. “We just got back from 
camp, so we’re all coming in 
with some tired legs, but I was 
still really pleased. Coach told 

us to try and run with our sub-
groups that we’ve been practic-
ing with, and I think there were 
some packs that were doing 
really well with that.”

If packing up was a main 

priority for the Wolverines, 
then runners three through six 
accomplished just that. Just 

nine 
seconds 

separated 
Evenson from 
redshirt junior 
Jamie 
Mor-

rissey, 
who 

took sixth with 
a time of 17:52. 
Redshirt junior 
Gina 
Sereno 

took 
fourth 

with a time of 
17:50 and red-

shirt sophomore Ellie Leonard 
claimed fifth (17:51).

Madeline Trevisan, an unat-

tached freshman, topped the 
incoming class with a time 
of 17:54 and claimed seventh 

place. Runners eight through 
10 included redshirt sopho-
more Claire Borchers in eighth 
(17:58), graduate student Erika 
Fluehr at ninth (17:58) and red-
shirt junior Jaimie Phelan at 
10th (18:07).

Despite the packing effort 

demonstrated by the middle 
runners, Michigan coach Mike 
McGuire would still like to see 
more of it throughout the lineup.

“To critique today, I would 

just say that we could have 
packed up a little bit more, 
to 
have 
everyone 
running 

controlled and side by side,” 
McGuire said. “But overall I 
thought we had a good, solid 
opener.”

With the first race out of the 

way, Michigan has an entire 
season ahead to focus on pack-
ing together. But even if the 
majority of the Wolverines do 
accomplish that, there’s a good 
possibility one runner will still 
be about 46 seconds ahead.

‘M’ wins Michigan Open

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

DEXTER, Mich. — Every 

time the leading runners broke 
into open space at the Michigan 
Open on Saturday, the same four 
men led the way for the Michi-
gan men’s cross country team. 
Redshirt junior Aaron Baumgar-
ten, redshirt junior Micah Beller 
and seniors Ben Flanagan and 
Connor Mora battled for posi-
tion throughout the race, with 
Baumgarten edging Flanagan by 
just 1.6 seconds.

The pack’s pace-setting effort 

in their first meet of the year 
comes as no surprise, though. 
The group owned four of the top 
five times for returning Wolver-
ines in the 5k coming into the sea-

son, and the upperclassmen will 
carry a heavy workload through-
out the 2016 season.

Though the event was non-

scoring, the heavy competition 
between Baumgarten, Beller, Fla-
nagan and Mora is nothing new 
either. The four have been run-
ning together for four years now 
and partially credit their success 
to the constant pushing from 
their own teammates.

“Throughout all of our work-

outs and our runs, we really stick 
together and try to have a pack 
mentality,” 
Baumgarten 
said. 

“When you’re running with three 
of your best friends, it’s a lot eas-
ier to push yourself harder than 
you ever have. Working together 
like that is critical for racing in 
championship meets.”

Added Michigan coach Kevin 

Sullivan: “If they get in the habit 
of working together now, it’s 
going to help them late in the sea-
son. When one guy is on and one 
guy is feeling a little rough, they 
can work together and help pull 
each other along.”

The Michigan Open was not 

a championship meet. In fact, 21 
of the 30 competitors in the meet 
were Michigan runners. So the 
Wolverines primarily used it as 
a tune-up for the remainder of 
their season.”

“It’s not a high-stress situation 

for us,” Sullivan said. “We came 
off of a good two weeks of camp, 
and we just wanted to get a race, 
simulation-type effort.”

Michigan will now turn its 

attention to the Indiana State 
Sycamore 
Invitational 
next 

weekend, and coming off its first 
Big Ten Championship since 
1998, keeping their eyes set on 
the future is something that Sul-
livan and his staff has impressed 
on the team.

“Last season was obviously 

great,” Beller said. “But I think 
the big thing this year was not to 
let that get in the way of moving 
the ball even further this year.”

Added Baumgarten: “(Coach 

Sullivan) has said this before: ‘All 
right, we were Big Ten champi-
ons, we had our moment. That 
doesn’t mean anything now. It’s 
about getting a Big Ten Champi-
onship this year, getting top ten 
at nationals this year. We can’t 
dwell on our past victories.’”

MEN’S SOCCER
Wolverines, Yale 
finish with draw

Michigan still 

searching for first 
win after one loss, 

three ties

By ROBERT HEFTER 

For the Daily

After dropping its home opener 

to Columbia, the Michigan men’s 
soccer team (0-1-2) returned to 
its 
home 

stadium 
looking 
for its first win of the season. But 
after a whirlwind game filled 
with momentum changes, neither 
the Wolverines nor the Bulldogs 
prevailed 
in 
overtime, 
and 

Michigan ended up with another 
2-2 tie.

The 
Wolverines 
dominated 

the first 35 minutes of the half, 
limiting Yale’s possession. But 
they couldn’t find the back of 
the net, and the half ended in a 
scoreless tie. 

The Bulldogs, meanwhile, had 

trouble even creating offensive 
chances, with pressure coming 
from Michigan’s veteran defense 
whose four starters have amassed 
162 career starts.

“We’re a team that once we get 

a couple chances, we start to build 
our confidence after that,” said 
senior forward Yamann Sahlool. 
“The more chances we got, the 
more we got to try more things 
and be more dangerous.”

During the first half, Michigan 

fired off five shots, two on goal, 
while Yale managed only four 
shots, but three were on goal. 

With leading shot taker and 

freshman forward Jack Hallahan 
absent from Michigan’s starting 
lineup, the Wolverines had no 
leading goal scorer, translating 
into the lack of shots.

But the second half would be 

defined by the holes in Michigan’s 

defense and the Bulldogs’ ability 
to take advantage of their limited 
chances.

“We carried the whole game,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley. “They didn’t really have 
anything to offer. Some set-piece 
issues were only the difference.”

The 
second 
half 
looked 

completely dissimilar to the first 
as it began with the Bulldogs 
converting a chance off of a 
Michigan foul. With a slow lobbed 
cross from the 30-yard mark, Yale 
defender Ollie Iselin poked the 
ball into the net out of a scrum.

Michigan 
reversed 
the 

momentum with back-to-back 
unanswered goals. The first was 
from last year’s Big Ten Freshman 
of the Year, Francis Atuahene, 
who buried the ball right under 
the goalkeeper’s arm. 

Just two minutes later, the 

second Wolverine goal came 
from Sahlool, who dangled three 
defenders and pushed the ball to 
the bottom left corner to give the 
Wolverines a 2-1 lead.

With 12 minutes left in the 

game, the momentum shifted 
again as Yale equalized with 
a similar goal to its first. On a 
lobbed ball off of a set piece, a 
Bulldog attacker poked the ball 
past diving junior goalkeeper 
Evan Louro to tie the game, 2-2.

The Wolverines dominated 

the 
first 
half 
of 
overtime, 

controlling almost all of the 
possession, but they were again 
unable to score due to some 
critical offside calls. The second 
overtime period looked much 
like the first, with neither team 
generating many chances.

“Honestly, 
it’s 
confidence 

at this point,” said sophomore 
midfielder 
Marcello 
Borges. 

“Once we get one or two wins, 
we’ll get things going again.” 

Michigan goes on the road 

to Wisconsin on Friday for its 
conference opener and will push 
for more scoring opportunities.

Newsome thrives at tackle

Competition has 
made sophomore 
better as he takes 
over starting role

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

When sophomore left tackle 

Grant Newsome was 10 years 
old, he wasn’t allowed to play 
Pee Wee football. He was too big. 

 His other option was to play 

with 15-year-olds, and his dad 
wasn’t about to let that happen. 
So Newsome’s football career 
officially started his freshman 
year of high school, when he 
was finally allowed to play with 
his classmates. After all of that 
waiting, he was awarded the 
unglamorous position as backup 
left tackle on the junior varsity 
team. At the time, he thought 
he would stick with baseball, 
another sport he excelled at and 
played year-round.

 Soon after, however, he 

realized 
his 
full 
football 

potential when he received an 
offer from Rutgers during his 
sophomore year. Until then, 
he hadn’t spoken with a single 
college coach. He started taking 
the sport more seriously after 
getting the offer.

 Now, at 6-foot-7 and 318 

pounds, it appears he made the 
right choice. 

In Saturday’s 63-3 win over 

Hawaii, Newsome started after a 
steady competition at left tackle 
throughout fall camp. According 
to offensive coordinator Tim 
Drevno, 
Ben 
Bredeson 
has 

been pressuring Newsome at 
the position ever since the true 
freshman stepped onto campus. 

 Newsome was the presumed 

starter going into the 2016 
season because of the in-game 
experiences he gained as a 
freshman, including starting at 
Minnesota on Oct. 31. He played 
in five games last year, but still 
considers himself a raw player. 

 Newsome knew that he 

would have to battle for the spot 
this season. 

“I didn’t really look at it that 

it was my job to lose. But I think, 
obviously, playing first string, 
I had some experience, but 
because I played as a freshman 
last year, I knew that Coach 
Drevno and Coach Harbaugh 
were going to roll the balls out 
and see who the best was,” 
Newsome said. “I didn’t have 
the attitude that I had the spot 
locked down, and I was really 
just 
excited 

to come out 
and 
compete 

for 
the 

opportunity 
and 
I 
think 

that 
I 

definitely 
got 
pushed 

and that I’ll 
continue to be 
pushed.”

 
Though 

Newsome played at left tackle, 
Bredeson did get to see the field 
while sharing left guard duties 
with senior Patrick Kugler as 
senior Ben Braden sat out due 

to injury. Though Braden should 
be 
returning 
for 
Saturday’s 

game against Central Florida, 
Harbaugh said Monday that 
Bredeson showed “very good 
signs for a future at left guard,” 
while also stating that Newsome 
“continues to be one of our top 
linemen.” 

 “I thought it was definitely 

a good start,” Newsome said of 
Saturday’s 
game. 
“Obviously 

there’s a lot left to improve. I 
think I’ll see that when I go over 
the film with coach Drevno. 

Definitely 
a 

lot 
of 
areas 

to 
improve 

on, but it was 
good 
to 
get 

out there and 
get our first 
start under my 
belt.”

 
After 

experiencing 
game 
action 

last 
season, 

it would be easy to approach 
this season with a more relaxed 
attitude. As a sophomore, he’s in 
a unique position. He’s a young 
player, but still experienced 

enough to draw on situations in 
which he has started. 

 Newsome thinks that’s the 

way it should be, and if the 
coaching staff wants to give 
playing time to freshmen, so 
be it. 

“For me, it was really helpful 

last year to get some experience 
in the game,” Newsome said. 
“It’s great to play for a coach 
who you know if you’re the best 
at your position, you’re going to 
play. I think that’s how it should 
be. It should be a meritocracy.” 

 With the pressure Newsome 

has received from Bredeson, it’s 
safe to say that he knows his 
job is never safe. Newsome had 
to climb his way up from the 
backup on junior varsity in high 
school, and after playing as the 
sixth man on the offensive line 
last season, he’s no stranger to 
competition. 

“(Bredeson) really pushed me 

throughout camp and he’s still 
going to push me, and I think it’s 
great for me because I can go out 
and practice every day and know 
that I have to earn a starting 
spot,” Newsome said. “It forces 
me to get better.”

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Sophomore left tackle Grant Newsome emerged from fall camp having won the starting job over Ben Bredeson.

“I think that’s 
how it should 
be. It should be 
a meritocracy.”

Five Things We Learned: Hawaii

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

We didn’t learn a lot about 

the 
Michigan 
football 
team 

on Saturday. The Wolverines 
were playing an overmatched 
opponent, Hawaii, sleepwalking 
into Saturday’s noon kickoff (6 
a.m. Hawaii time) after playing 
halfway across the world in 
Sydney last weekend.

But here’s what we know: 

Michigan took care of business 
against 
that 
overmatched 

opponent and did so handily, 
something not every team can 
say after the opening week of the 
season. And the Wolverines still 
have a few weeks before they face 
a team with as much talent as they 
have, they certainly did their part 
Saturday.

Here are five takeaways:

1. The defensive line’s depth 
will be tested again.

Michigan ended up OK from 

an injury standpoint last season, 
especially at the major positions. 
But the one position group that 
suffered 
was 
the 
defensive 

line. End Mario Ojemudia tore 
his Achilles in Week 5 against 
Maryland, 
and 
tackle 
Ryan 

Glasgow hurt his pectoral muscle 
in Week 9 against Rutgers. Both 
injuries were season-ending.

The Wolverines answer with 

even more depth this season, and 
they may need it. They already 
played Saturday without tackle 
Maurice Hurst, who was almost 
healthy but sat out as a precaution. 
The statuses of end Taco Charlton 
(ankle) and tackle Bryan Mone 
(undisclosed), 
both 
of 
whom 

started Saturday and both of 
whom left the game in the second 
quarter, are less certain.

Head coach Jim Harbaugh 

didn’t give a timetable for either 
injury and wouldn’t say what 
Mone’s injury was, only that he 
would have an MRI. Mone tore 
his ACL in fall camp last year and 

missed the season.

Without 
Hurst 
and 
Mone 

for the second half Saturday, 
Michigan was already down to 
fifth-year seniors Ryan Glasgow 
and Matt Godin on the inside, 
though Chris Wormley can also 
move to tackle. And it’s possible 
Hurst, Mone and Charlton will 
all be fine for Saturday, but either 
way, it’s certainly more injury 
questions than Harbaugh wanted 
to address after a blowout.

2. Ben Bredeson can step in just 
fine.

High praise came out of 

fall camp for Bredeson, a true 
freshman offensive lineman from 
Hartland, Wis. He was competing 
with sophomore Grant Newsome 
and redshirt sophomore Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty for the starting 

left 
tackle 
spot, 
and 
while 

Newsome ended up winning it, 
Bredeson will see the field plenty 
this season.

His debut began when he came 

in at left guard for redshirt junior 
Patrick Kugler, who himself was 
stepping in for fifth-year senior 
starter Ben Braden. Bredeson 
acclimated well — albeit against 
a poor opponent, a necessary 
qualifier 
for 
most 
of 
these 

statements — and Michigan’s 
rushing attack didn’t miss a beat 
when he entered the game.

It’s not clear where Bredeson 

will go from here. Harbaugh 
said 
Braden’s 
absence 
was 

precautionary like Hurst’s, so it’s 
possible Braden will return next 
week and fill out the starting 
offensive line. But as with many 
freshmen, the Wolverines appear 
eager to find a place for Bredeson.

3. Dr. Blitz is aptly named.

Hawaii’s offense would be the 

best advocate for this statement. 
Michigan’s defense, led by new 
coordinator Don Brown, blitzed 
the Rainbow Warriors, literally 
and figuratively, all afternoon.

“I’d 
say 
like 
90 
percent? 

Every play was a blitz actually, I 
think,” said senior defensive back 
Channing Stribling. “I don’t think 
any play wasn’t a blitz, besides a 
cover two. And we blitzed out of 
that, too.”

The Wolverines brought the 

house several times and peppered 
Hawaii 
quarterback 
Ikaika 

Woolsey with four sacks and 
countless more pressures. They 
also racked up 10 tackles for loss.

The blitz packages bode well 

for Michigan’s least experienced 
position group, the linebackers. In 

fact, each of the team’s top three 
tacklers were linebackers: Jabrill 
Peppers and Mike McCray with 
7.5 each and Ben Gedeon with five.

4. Harbaugh has no qualms 
about playing freshmen.

The second-year head coach has 

said in the past that he believes a 
fifth year to be a mutual agreement 
between player and coach. And 
while he brought back most of the 
fourth-year juniors from his first 
season, a few moved on.

That mindset showed in the way 

that he played 17 true freshmen — 
a school record — in Saturday’s 
game. Some, including Bredeson, 
defensive end Rashan Gary and 
wide receiver Eddie McDoom, 
figure to be contributors for most 
of the season. But for some others, 
Harbaugh chose to burn their 

redshirts and reward them for the 
hard work during camp that he 
has lauded for weeks.

Michigan’s 
recruiting 
class, 

ranked No. 6 in the country by 
ESPN.com, also consisted of 28 
players, tied for third among 
the top 75 classes. Gary was the 
highlight, but the Wolverines 
also brought in a host of other 
immediate contributors.

Running back Chris Evans 

totaled 112 yards, more than twice 
as many as any other player, and 
two touchdowns. McDoom was 
electric, with 19- and 15-yard 
carries to go with two receptions 
for 15 yards. Defensive lineman 
Michael Dwumfour, linebacker 
Devin Bush and safety Khaleke 
Hudson each recorded tackles.

Harbaugh may have preserved 

some redshirts — freshman kicker 
Quinn Nordin didn’t lose his on a 
few extra points in a blowout — 
but the head coach followed up on 
his plan to use players if they are 
ready to play.

5. Bold Prediction: Jourdan 
Lewis returns this week and 
catches an interception.

Lewis has spoken to media on 

a couple of occasions since camp 
opened and seemed particularly 
eager to get his senior season 
underway. At Big Ten Media Days, 
he also expressed his excitement 
about getting his hands on the ball 
more this year, via interceptions 
and by playing on offense. An 
apparently nagging injury kept 
him out of Saturday’s opener and 
put all of those desires on hold.

But Harbaugh said he sat 

Lewis on Saturday just to be safe, 
and 
Michigan’s 
All-American 

cornerback should be back this 
week against Central Florida. The 
Knights seem improved under new 
coach Scott Frost, but they did finish 
0-12 last year and haven’t faced a 
defense like Michigan’s in a while. 
Lewis should be extra motivated to 
make up for lost time by forcing a 
turnover in his season debut.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Injuries to senior defensive end Taco Charlton and redshirt sophomore tackle Bryan Mone will test the depth of Michigan’s defensive line.

that weight was lifted off my 
shoulders, and I was able to just 
get comfortable and fire some 
shots in the pocket,” Speight said.

He would be just fine.
Following the interception, 

Speight went 10-for-12 for 145 
yards and three touchdowns.

There he was, 7:31 into the 

first quarter, throwing a 12-yard 
touchdown pass to sophomore 
wide receiver Grant Perry in the 
corner of the endzone to cap off 
an 11-play, 98-yard scoring drive. 
Just over six minutes later, he 
was there again, hitting senior 
tight end Jake Butt for a 19-yard 
touchdown over the pylon. He 
did it one last time a few minutes 
into the second quarter, keep-
ing cool and getting the ball to 
wide-open fifth-year senior wide 
receiver Amara Darboh.

But before all of that, Har-

baugh, a quarterback expert by 
nature, had to find a way to keep 
his new starter calm.

“I was kind of running toward 

the sideline anyway (after the 
interception) so my momentum 
just kind of carried me right 
into Coach,” Speight said. “He 
just grabbed me and hugged me 
and was kind of laughing, and 
was like, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll get 
it next drive, don’t sweat about 
that.’ ”

Harbaugh finds the ways in 

which quarterbacks respond to 
interceptions interesting. Some-
times, he said, they think of ways 
not to screw up, and usually that 
doesn’t bode well.

“It’s very difficult for a quar-

terback to throw an interception 
on a series, and then come back 
and lead a touchdown drive 
following a series,” Harbaugh 
said. “It’s something I’ve always 
been fascinated in watching 

quarterbacks … to see him start 
the next drive on the two-yard 
line, that’s as much adversity as 
you can have for a quarterback 
starting a series, starting a drive. 
… He responded in tremendous 
fashion.”

Speight said after the game 

that he knew it was his job to lose 
heading into summer camp, and 
that he felt confident through-
out in his ability to keep it. It’s 
unclear if Harbaugh ever even 
told him specifically that he 
would be starting. It seems like it 
was an unspoken agreement, and 
that speaks to the nature of the 
competition between Speight and 
redshirt juniors John O’Korn and 
Shane Morris.

And after that battle, in which 

Harbaugh chose Speight, Speight 
had to prove he didn’t make the 
wrong decision.
