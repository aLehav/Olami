Growing up on Detroit’s 

West Side, Walter Stevenson, 
an engineering junior at the 
University of Michigan, never 
saw 
anything 
wrong 
with 

the 
Detroit 
Public 
Schools 

district. 
From 
kindergarten 

through 
sixth 
grade, 
he 

thought all schools wouldn’t 
let students stray too far from 
the 
playground 
because 
it 

was centered in a rougher 
neighborhood. He thought all 
schools had books that were 
“not only outdated, (but) usually 
dilapidated and ripped up.”

 It wasn’t until seventh grade, 

when Stevenson transferred to a 

private school, that he began to 
notice discrepancies between 
DPS and other school districts.

 “I saw the difference in the 

quality of education and the 
quality of schooling … you have 
to grow up quickly,” Stevenson 
said. “If you went to a private 
school, at that age, you’d think 
that the world was kinda perfect 
and you didn’t really have to 
worry about anything.”

 To Stevenson, the length 

of one’s childhood seemed to 
depend on the income bracket 
their school was surrounded by.

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents held its 
monthly 
meeting 
Thursday 

afternoon on the UM-Flint 
campus, 
discussing 
topics, 

including new resources for 
research, 
the 
appointment 

of the University’s first chief 
information 
officer, 
a 
new 

scholarship created by Central 
Student Government and the 
approval of a new nursing 
school on the Flint campus.

Appointment of new VP for 

Information Technology and 
Chief Information Officer

University President Mark 

Schlissel 
and 
the 
Board 

of 
Regents 
announced 
on 

Thursday the appointment of 
Kelli Trosvig as the University 
of Michigan’s first vice president 
for 
information 
technology 

and chief information officer, 
effective Nov. 14.

The new position was created 

and approved by the board in 
February with the aim to better 
consider information strategy in 
decision-making and planning 
processes for the University. In 
her new role, Trosvig will also 
be overseeing the creation of a 
broad information technology 
strategy, which will be applied 
to the whole University.

Trosvig 
currently 
serves 

as 
the 
vice 
president 
for 

information 
technology 
and 

chief information officer at 

the University of Washington. 
Schlissel said in a press release 
he believes Trosvig’s experience 
at UW will be a valuable 
attribute to her service at the 
University of Michigan.

“Ms. Trosvig’s experience as 

a higher education leader at the 
University of Washington will 
help her lead in U-M’s complex 
environment, 
spread 
across 

three campuses and our health 
system,” Schlissel said.

In her current role, Trosvig 

directs an IT team of about 
850 individuals with an annual 
operating budget of more than 
$116 million and $25 million in 
annual capital expenditures.

Under her leadership, UW 

has 
instituted 
initiatives 

regarding 
modernization 

of 
major 
administrative 

systems, 
improvements 
to 

infrastructure, 
security 

and privacy across the UW 

networks and enhanced mobile 
offerings.

“I am excited about joining 

the team at Michigan,” Trosvig 
said in a University press 
release. “It’s an opportunity to 
contribute to an outstanding 
technology 
community 
and 

I look forward to working 
together 
to 
build 
upon 

Michigan’s already strong IT 
programs.”

In honor of the University of 

Michigan’s upcoming bicentennial 
celebrations, the University is 
planning to send a time capsule 
spaceship into orbit around Earth 
— the first time capsule of its 
kind, according to the Michigan 
Bicentennial 
Archive 
project 

website.

Engineering graduate student 

Kevin 
Tebbe, 
leader 
of 
the 

M-BARC program, wrote in an 
email interview that he thinks 
the program is an opportunity to 
showcase the achievements of the 
University’s 200-year history. The 
capsule, which is student-designed 
and launched, will be retrieved 
from space in 100 years by a team 
of students.

“The purpose of this time capsule 

is to celebrate the University of 
Michigan, its accomplishments and 
its contributions to society,” Tebbe 
wrote. “We want to showcase the 
technological capabilities of this 
university and push future students 
to increase our space capabilities by 
devising a way to retrieve this time 
capsule through a similar student 
team/project that we are using to

Students for Choice hosted its 

4th annual Abortion Speak Out, 
a gathering for individuals of the 
community to share and listen 
to stories of abortion, Thursday 
night. Approximately 50 students 

gathered at the speak out, in 
comparison to 300 in attendance 
from the previous year’s event.

Only one person — featured 

guest speaker Melissa Madera 
— spoke at the event, though 
students were encouraged to share 
their stories.

Sharing was limited to only 

those 
who 
had 
experienced 

an abortion, but all members 
of the University of Michigan 
community were encouraged to 
come and listen. Event organizers 
also restricted the use of social 
media and recording devices while 
attendees spoke to respect the 
speakers’ privacy.

During her remarks, Madera, 

creator 
of 
the 
podcast 
The 

Abortion Diary, an archive of 
abortion stories, told the crowd 
about her personal story and 
explained her mission to create 
a resource for individuals with 
experiences of abortion.

Members of Students for Choice 

said they were inspired by the 1 in 
3 Campaign, which seeks to end

The University of Michigan 

hosted speakers from the technical, 
legal and operational sectors of 
cyber security, to discuss the field’s 
latest trends and threats for its 12th 
annual cyber security conference 
Thursday.

The conference, titled Security 

at the University of Michigan IT, is 
the University’s flagship event for 
National Cybersecurity Awareness 
Month.

It attracted a wide range of 

students, faculty and Ann Arbor 
residents — 700 viewers registered 
to either attend the event in person 
or stream it online, for 13 panels. 
Law Prof. Margo Schlanger was 
the only female panelist among 
the panels at the event, which 
included public and private sector 
representatives.

Kelly Auwers, a planner of 

the event and an administrative 
assistant 
for 
Information 

and 
Technology 
Services, 

acknowledged the lack of female 
representation, connecting it to 
diversity and inclusion in the field 
of cyber security as a whole.

launch it.”

Tebbe, who is also leading a team 

charged with the satellite’s altitude 
and 
power 
control, 
replaced 

Climate and Space Prof. Thomas 
Zurbuchen as the program leader 
following his departure last month 
to accept a role as head of the NASA 
Science Mission Directorate.

The capsule itself, according 

to M-BARC, will be a total of 
3,000 cubic centimeters and will 
include a roughly equal space for 
propulsion hardware, payload and 
communications equipment.

“The time capsule will be a 3U 

CubeSat which has the dimensions 
of 30x10x10 cm,” Tebbe wrote. “1/3 
of the volume will be taken up by 
the propulsion device which will 
enable us to position ourselves in a 
legal and stable orbit after the initial 
insertion from the launch vehicle. 
Another third of the spacecraft 
will be taken up by the control and 
communications systems which 
will allow the satellite to orient 
itself and confirm its position early 
in its life. The last third will include 
the payload and retroreflectors.”

The capsule will contain a 

record of student and faculty 
interviews, a sample of DNA that 
will test the molecule’s long-term 
durability and a physical artifact 
from the University.

“The first piece we are including 

is a silicon data chip created by the 
Lurie Nanofabrication Facility that 
will contain the transcriptions 
and possibly the recordings of 
approximately 1,000 University of 
Michigan affiliate,” Tebbe wrote. 
“We’ll be interviewing students, 
staff, faculty, alumni and those 
who work at or have worked at the 
University in any capacity.”

These interviews will be aimed 

at highlighting the life of the 
average University affiliate. 

“We want to use the interviews 

to create a snapshot of the 
University as it exists right now,” 
he wrote. “The main goal of the 
interviews is to not cherry pick the 
best parts so that we can provide 
the most accurate depiction of day-
to-day life at the University.”

Engineering senior Samidha 

Visai, 
who 
works 
on 
funds 

management and public outreach 
with 
M-BARC, 
likened 
the 

interviews to a portrait in time at 
the University. 

“We want to interview the 

faculty working hard in the MoJo 

cafeteria, we want to interview the 
Dean of Engineering, we want to 
interview alumni,” she said. “We 
want to provide deep and personal 
interviews of a variety of people’s 
raw experiences living in 2017 and 
within the (University) ecosystem 
for those who will read the stories 
in 100 years.”

The DNA sample that will be 

included will be slightly altered to 
reflect school spirit, Tebbe said — 
it has been encoded to contain the 
University’s Alma Mater song.

The 
encoding, 
according 

to Visai, is an experiment that 
will be completed by University 
researchers in the future.

“(The capsule contains a) DNA 

radiation experiment such that 
scientists in 100 years will be able to 
examine long-term space radiation 
effects on a human,” Visai said.

The final part of the payload will 

be a secret from the public until 
next year when the time capsule 
is officially unveiled to the public. 
However, both Visai and Tebbe 
said it will be an object or piece of 
artwork from the University.

This 
project’s 
purpose, 

according to Visai, is to honor the 
University’s bicentennial as well 
as its history and future in space 
science.

“We want to see a true 

celebration of everyone who is 
a part of our University,” Visai 
said. “Not just the leadership, not 
just the athletes, not just stellar 
students. We want everyone who 
is a part of our University to feel 
like this is a celebration of our 
community, a community that 
they have impacted. We want this 
to be exciting and something to 
remember for everyone involved 
with Michigan in 2017 and going 
forward, as well as alumni.”

The spacecraft is slated to 

be sealed in fall 2017 with an 
accompanying 
dedication 
and 

unveiling ceremony. 

“We are currently working on a 

NASA proposal that would grant 
us a free launch for our system,” 
Tebbe wrote. “We have had luck in 
the past with launch proposals and 
won a free ULA launch for a test 
version of the time capsule that will 
likely launch in spring/summer 
of 2017. However, even if we don’t 
receive a free launch for the time 
capsule, we are working with 
multiple launch providers who 
have availabilities in 2018/2019 for 
our launch.”

Nursing school for Flint
Several University of Michigan 

regents and chief executives 
broke into cheers after the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
nursing 

school to the Flint campus was 
unaminously approved by the 
Regents during the meeting.

Flint 
Chancellor 
Susan 

Borrego told the board that 
more than 19 percent of the 
UM-Flint student body studies 
nursing or pre-nursing, and the 
current department has trained 
more than 3,000 nurses and 
nurse practitioners. The school’s 
proposal took nearly three years 
to finalize, with input from 
governing faculty, the School of 
Health Professions and Studies 
and various advisory boards.

Borrego said the school will 

create new opportunities and 
specialties for students, while 
keeping the Flint campus on 
pace with changes in science, 
technology and health care.

“This reflects the importance 

of the field, which is one of the 
fastest growing occupations in 
the state,” Borrego said.

The nursing school would be 

the fifth school within the Flint 
system, and the first additional 
unit 
created 
since 
1997. 
A 

University press release noted the 
new school will create programs 
and partnerships with more 
than 700 local organizations 
in an effort to strengthen ties 
between the University and its 
surrounding community.

Regent Michael Behm (D), a 

Flint native and current litigator 
in the city, said he thought would 
be beneficial to the community. 
Behm is involved in Flint through 
serving on the Board of Trustees 
of the Flint Institute of Arts, as 
well as by being a Big Brother 
through the Big Brothers/Big 
Sisters mentorship program in 
the city and as a founding member 
of the Flint Youth Initiative.

“As a lifetime member and 

citizen of Genesee county, I really 
support this program,” Behm 
said.

Regent Denise Ilitch (D) said 

the school’s creation was all the 
more important for Flint’s amid 
the city’s water crisis, which has 
resulted inchildren and adults 
in the city suffering from lead 
poisoning.

“This is phenomenal and very, 

very exciting,” she said. “For the 
community … nurses do God’s 
work.”

Record funding for research, 

endowment and donations to 
new centers

S. Jack Hu, the University’s 

vice 
president 
for 
research, 

announced University research 
funding rose to a record volume 
of $1.39 billion in fiscal year 
2012, marking a 7.2 percent 
increase in the last year. Much 
of the increase in funding, 
according to a University press 
release, comes from growth in 
contracts with federal agencies 
like the Department for Health 
and Human Services and the 
Department of Defense.

“The growing investment in 

U-M research is a measure of 

the continuing confidence of our 
sponsors in the value that our 
faculty and students bring to 
society,” Hu said in a University 
press release.

Executive 
officers 
also 

highlighted 
donations 
to 

research 
initiatives, 
most 

notably a $10.75 million gift from 
alumni Frances and Kenneth 
Eisenberg to develop treatments 
at the Depression Center. The 
research hub, housed within the 
University Health System, is the 
first ever multidisciplinary effort 
to bring together the research, 
education 
and 
treatment 
of 

depressive and bipolar illnesses.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel thanked the Eisenberg 
family and said the center’s work 
is pivotal to addressing access 
to mental health services on 
campus.

“This generous gift will help 

the center develop personalized 
treatments,” he said. “This gift 
will help … fight depression and 
its associated stigmas.”

As 
a 
supplement 
to 
the 

donation, the board voted to 
award a professorship named 
after the Eisenberg family to 
Psychiatry 
Prof. 
Srijan 
Sen, 

whom Schlissel called a “world-
class expert on the biology of 
stress and depression.”

Regent Katherine White (D) 

also presented figures of the 
University’s endowment in the 
fiscal year 2016. Distributions to 
the general fund exceeded $300 
million for the first time, and the 
total value of the endowment 
reached $9.7 billion at the end of 
the summer.

classes alongside Stevenson at 
Renaissance High School. Though 
Chrzan lauded it as “the top 
magnet school in the city,” he said 
even Renaissance lacked teaching 
materials that students consider 
to be crucial in a 21st-century 
education.

 
“Every 
foreign 
language 

classroom 
has 
a 
computer 

lab,” Chrzan said. “If we were 
lucky, half of the computers (at 
Renaissance) worked. Even the 
top school in the district was 
facing slight disadvantages.”

 For DPS students, the journey 

from city to the University is often 
not an easy one because of factors 
such as the neighborhood the 
school is located in, availability 
of 
materials, 
infrastructural 

problems and even the salaries 
of its teachers. Chrzan and 
Stevenson, as well as other 
students interviewed who have 
traversed 
that 
path, 
said 
it 

requires immense amounts of 
determination on behalf of the 
students to want to receive a 
higher level of education.

 Erica Sanders, director of 

Undergraduate 
Admissions 
at 

the University, is a DPS alum. 
She acknowledged there has 
been a decline in DPS enrollment 
at the University, attributing it 
to the local effects in the city of 
the 2008 economic downturn. 
However, she noted that the 
University takes into account the 
varied availability of pre-college 
programming — like the computer 
programming 
class 
Stevenson 

found he was lacking — when 
offering admission to students.

 “Michigan is doing everything 

we can to encourage and attract 
the students who have challenged 
themselves by taking advantage 
of the educational opportunities 
available to them in the context 
of their home high schools, and 
providing 
academic 
support 

where we realize opportunities 
may not be as abundant,” Sanders 
said.

 Upon arriving at the University, 

Chrzan 
and 
Stevenson 
both 

noticed DPS had not adequately 
prepared them for the college 
application process, or the caliber 
of education on campus.

 
“Coming 
from 
a 
family 

where I’m one of the first to go 
through the process of applying 
to numerous schools, there was a 
large learning gap that my school 
didn’t necessarily help me fill 
in terms of the things I need to 
know and be ready for such as 
how to fill out the FAFSA … and 
there was a large learning curve 
at the beginning of my senior year 
(of high school) of things that I 
actually need to have to complete 
a college application,” Chrzan 
said.

 Stevenson said he noted 

certain requirements for the 
Engineering 
college, 
like 

computer programming classes, 
were out of reach. Additionally, he 
noticed significant discrepancies 
in applicant placement test scores 
in math between him and his 
peers.

 “There were certain classes 

that 
we 
just 
didn’t 
have,” 

Stevenson said. “I noticed that 
the kids that came from Detroit 
Public 
Schools 
— 
they 
are 

typically in the lower maths. We 
were either taking pre-calc or calc 
1. … It felt unfair because a lot of 
(other students) already knew 
how to program and it was our 
first time so it made learning a lot 
more difficult.”

 Many students, including 

Stevenson, have charged that 
coming 
from 
a 
low-income 

district puts Detroit students 
at 
a 
disadvantage 
regarding 

both 
academic 
success 
and 

mental health. In 2011, the 
U.S. Department of Education 
reported that “many high-poverty 
schools receive less than their fair 

share of state and local funding, 
leaving students in high-poverty 
schools with fewer resources 
than schools attended by their 
wealthier peers.” Citing new 
school-level spending and teacher 
salaries, former U.S. Secretary 
of Education Arne Duncan said 
in the 2011 press release that 
educational red tape is stopping 
the students from receiving the 
aid they need.

 “Educators across the country 

understand 
that 
low-income 

students 
need 
extra 
support 

and resources to succeed, but in 
far too many places policies for 
assigning teachers and allocating 
resources are perpetuating the 
problem rather than solving it,” 
Duncan said.

 
For 
both 
Chrzan 
and 

Stevenson, a specific pressure in 
the college application process 
began when they got to high 
school — the quickly arriving 
ACT.

 The average ACT score of 

the entering 2016 class at the 
University is between a 30 and 
a 34. According to the Michigan 
Department of Education, the 
average score for the state of 
Michigan in 2015 was 19.9. The 
average score at Renaissance 
High School was 20.9, the highest 
average ACT score in DPS for 
2015.

 Stevenson said many students 

are discouraged from trying their 
best and attempting to get to a 
school like the University because 
if a student receives any score 
above the average, it is considered 
exemplary by DPS standards even 
though it isn’t by the University’s 
standards, creating a culture 
aiming for the average instead of 
encouraging students to excel.

 “I looked at the average ACT 

at U of M in 2014 and said, ‘OK, 
that’s what I need to reach,’ ” 
Stevenson said. “Then you have 
all the staff and teachers, since 
typically the students never get 
anything near that, they say, ‘OK, 
guys, just shoot for a 21. Shoot for 
that. At least get that.’ They’re 
telling us to aim so low because 
they don’t expect much out of us 
so people like me who were trying 
to go for 30s, they think, ‘Oh, 

they’re not really expecting me 
to do well anyways.’ Mentally, it 
wears on you.”

 Since the educational culture 

children are subjected to affects 
their education immensely, the 
Detroit Federation of Teachers 
took to the streets to garner 
attention 
surrounding 
the 

physical deterioration of DPS 
schools. In January, teachers 
staged multiple “sickouts” —- a 
form of protest where teachers 
call in sick in large numbers so 
that school is cancelled — to 
draw attention to the working 
conditions they operate in.

 While the DFT used physical 

marches and sickouts to draw 
attention from the city, photos 
of classrooms with moldy and 
cracked walls, missing tiles and 
a lack of insulated windows were 
also shared on Twitter to further 
raise awareness.

Chrzan 
said 
he 
saw 
the 

infrastructural issues in DPS 
as an injustice to the children 
in the district, who deserve an 
equal opportunity as anyone in a 
public school district to receive an 
education.

“What’s going on in a lot of 

DPS schools is criminal, in my 
opinion,” Chrzan said. “These are 
things that children should not 
have to deal with at the one place 
that should be safe for them.”

Along with the infrastructure 

issues, 
teachers 
have 
also 

protesting their wages. According 
to the Michigan Department of 
Education, the average salary of 
DPS teachers, which is $5,095 per 
pupil, was ranked 462 out of 581 
school districts.

The cry for better wages did 

not come as a surprise to Marion 
Berger, 
program 
coordinator 

for Semester in Detroit at the 
University, who said she saw the 
effect of low salaries for DPS 
teachers through her mother’s 
career as a teacher in the district 
for 30 years.

“I remember her taking cuts 

and her salary diminishing every 
year even though she had been 
working more and more years in 
DPS,” Berger said.

Stevenson said DPS teachers 

have 
more 
responsibilities 

than 
those 
in 
high-income 

neighborhoods 
and 
therefore 

deserve compensation for their 
work.

“Not only do they overall not 

make enough money, on top of that, 
they have to deal with students 
from lower-income families so a 
lot of (students) aren’t motivated 
to aspire to do something greater,” 
Stevenson said. “Some students, 
their biggest accomplishment is 
graduating high school. You have 
a lot of rowdy students at times 
and that’s a lot of extra work that 
most teachers don’t even have to 
deal with.”

Responses 
from 
the 

government to the protests have 
been varied. In a May speech 
in Flint, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 
condemned the sickouts, saying, 

“That’s not a constructive act 
with respect to getting legislation 
through.” 
Several 
Republican 

members of the state legislature 
have stated similar sentiments in 
response to the protest.

This past June, before the 

sickouts, 
Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder 

signed into law a $617 million 
state aid package for DPS. The 
package called for paying off $467 
million in debt accumulated by 
DPS and allocated an additional 
$150 
million 
to 
create 
the 

new 
Detroit 
Public 
Schools 

Community District, as well as 
pay for transitional costs and new 
programs. Under the structure 
of the aid package, two school 
districts will essentially exist — 
one to hold the debt, and one to 
function as a school district day 
to day.

During a press conference, 

Snyder 
said 
the 
package 

“promises a brighter future for all 
of Detroit’s children.”

However, 
Democrats 
and 

Detroiters have opposed the bill, 
saying it lacked components like 
the creation of a Detroit Education 
Commission, 
an 
organization 

that would have authority over 
both public and charter schools 
in the city. This commission was 
seen as crucial by Democrats and 
Detroiters in negotiations over 
the aid package.

In November, as a result of 

the new law, Detroiters will elect 
a new school board for DPSCD 
who will take office in January 
and will then hire a permanent 
superintendent.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Steven Wasko, 
DPS 
executive 
director 
of 

academic enrollment, said he sees 
the future of DPSCD as bright and 
positive.

“We have nothing but hope 

that we are heading in a positive 
direction and we do have a fresh 
start in that we have local control,” 
Wasko said. “Frankly, being in the 
district, being in schools, being in 
the classrooms every single day, 
there is a very hopeful attitude ... 
on the part of all.”

When asked what they believe 

the future holds for the students 
of DPSCD, both Stevenson and 
Chrzan said they had faith 
students wouldn’t let a lacking 
educational environment keep 
them from succeeding.

“Although DPS has had its 

struggles, I still feel like there 
are a lot of gifted and talented 
students that live in Detroit 
and that may be going to DPS,” 
Stevenson said. “I think that in 
a sense, those students that still 
can push to do their best and 
overcome obstacles … that says a 
lot about those students.”

“For all of its troubles, there 

are still amazing teachers and 
students here, and regardless of 
the conditions, from the motto of 
the city itself ‘From the ashes, it 
will rise again,’ ” Chrzan said. “I 
very much believe that over the 
next five or 10 years, there will 
at least be the same amount if 
not more students coming from 
DPSCD to schools like Michigan 
… because I think district is only 
going to go up from here.”

dinner, and Margo (Schlanger) and 
I were the only females,” Auwers 
said. “In ITS, we’ve been having 
these discussions about why there 
aren’t more women in tech. And 
I think there are a lot more now; 
they’re still kind of working their 
way up. We have to get them to 
higher positions, where they could 
be doing stuff like this.”

Don Welch, the University’s 

chief information security officer, 
introduced the first panel with the 
theme that would run throughout 
the entire day: the compromise 
citizens 
make 
between 
civil 

liberties and cyber security.

“Security is hard,” Welsh said. 

“It is something that we are going 
to constantly have to battle with. 

… I keep thinking that maybe 
we’ve hit bottom, but nope, we’ve 
got a ways to go. There are very 
few ways we can get more secure 
without giving up something. One 
of the things we generally have 
to trade off for more security is 
privacy. A society has to decide 
what’s the right trade-off.”

During the panel, “Hacking and 

Securing the Internet of Things,” 
the panelists discussed the surge 
of “smart devices” and their 
susceptibility to hacks. Panelist 
Sol Bermann, the privacy officer 
and IT Policy and Assurance 
strategist at the University, cited 
a New York Times article that 
reported a nearly 70-percent 
increase 
in 
Internet-of-things 

devices worldwide, which allow 
for greater internetworking of 
physical devices and software.

“We’re going to have an omni-

connected, 
Internet-of-things 

world,” Bermann said.

Panelist 
Matthew 
Garrett, 

the principal security software 
engineer at CoreOS, noted the 
negative realities of a world 
so 
intensely 
linked 
through 

technology, pointing to the loss of 
privacy as an example.

“We’ve seen active attacks on 

celebrities’ email accounts … that 
contain information about them,” 
Garrett said. “If you were able to 
compromise a celebrity in order to 
obtain a video feed, that could be 
a very financially lucrative thing 
for people with loose morals to 
engage in. But it’s important to 
remember that not all attacks 
are driven by financial concern. 
There are plenty of people on the 
Internet who are just bored.”

of 
creating 
an 

environment where individuals 
could share stories.

“I think especially in the current 

political and social climate; it’s just 
really important to recognize that

that these aren’t statistics,” Webb 

said.

Wednesday, 
in

Democratic

a pro-life stance, stating he does 
not support partial birth abortions.

echoed Webb’s statements and 
said holding an event like this 
where people could speak openly 
is key to creating a productive

“The space is vital,” Akire said. 

“Whether or not people speak, 

it’s important to have a reserved 
physical space for women who 
have had abortions to come and 
talk about that.”

Webb and Public Policy junior

this year’s event had a lower

Wilson, however, said she hopes 
members of the community come 
to the speak out next year and seek 
out their resources.

“We continue to hold this event 

just to create a space on campus 
that says ‘You’re welcome here, 
you’re welcome to share and 
you’re just welcome to listen,’ ” 
Wilson said.

F

ree speech debates tend 
to be dominated by two 
positions, both of which 

mask their radical and insidious 
natures 
by 
appealing 
to 

seemingly innocuous principles. 
Adherents 
of 
both 
camps 

would do well to be more self-
critical, to recognize that the 
motivations of their opponents 
are not so corrupt as they 
may seem and to understand 
that pureness of heart is not a 
sufficient justification for the 
policies they prescribe. 

On 
one 
hand, 
many 

conservatives 
hold 
that 
the 

innate right to free expression 
entails that any speech is to 
be tolerated, since regulation 
would in principle curtail our 
fundamental right to freedom. 
On the other, some believe 
that hate speech ought to be 
banned because it offends the 
sensibilities of others. Whether 
or not the adherents of these 
positions will admit it, these are 
the basic principles operative in 
campus free speech debates.

Both views are mistaken, 

and each implies unacceptable 
consequences. 
However, 

moderation for its own sake 
is no virtue — though some 
compromise may be hammered 
out 
between 
the 
relevant 

interests 
involved, 
it’s 
not 

enough 
that 
we 
leave 
this 

matter to arbitrary case-by-case 
judgment. Instead, we must 
offer an alternative principle of 
speech right that overcomes the 
difficulties of each view. This 
principle will follow from the 
very idea of right itself.

To navigate any controversy 

of 
justice, 
we 
must 
first 

recognize a fundamental fact: 
Questions of justice arise only 
when individuals are considered 
together. Alone, an individual 
may act well or poorly, but it’s 
only among others that they 
may act justly. In any exercise 
of free choice, an individual 
limits the freedom of another; 
in making something mine, I 
make it not thine. In claiming 
a right, a person places others 
under an obligation to respect 
his freedom, so to be a free agent 
is to stand in a relation that 
implies a reciprocal limitation 
on the freedom of others. Justice 
concerns those conditions under 
which my rightful freedoms are 

made compatible with those of 
others through the imposition of 
a general rule of conduct.

What becomes apparent is 

that any determination of rights 
implies the limitation of the 
freedom of some for the sake 
of others. However, if (as I will 
only grant here, but not attempt 
to justify) people are by nature 
morally equal, we encounter 
a problem. Because we are all 
rational beings capable of making 
judgments, it would violate the 
general principle of equality if 
some individuals were privileged 
in imposing their merely private 
judgments on others. Even if I 
have reasons for restricting your 
freedom, my reasons are my own, 
so they could never justify this 
restriction. This is the origin of 
justice as public reason — that 
is, the settlement of rights must 
rest on a principle that regards 
each individual as rightfully 
equal and which determines the 
limits of rights only by reference 
to reasons equally valid for all. 
To live in a rightful condition 
is to have claims on others only 
insofar as you are also bound by 
those same claims of others on 
you (and vice versa).

It 
should 
be 
clear 
why 

straightforward 
justifications 

of speech restrictions (which 
typically appeal to the subjective 
sentiments of individuals — 
feelings of offense — or to an 
ideological goal) fail. There are 
roughly two reasons for this. 
The first, weaker reason is that 
they require that an authority 
(i.e., the University of Michigan) 
has a substantive conception 
of an extrinsic good to be 
promoted by speech (e.g., social 
justice, climate awareness, etc.). 
But this isn’t a valid reason for 
all individuals whose freedoms 
are to be restricted, because 
some individuals don’t judge 
that to be a necessary good. 
The second reason is that the 
basic principle for determining 
rights cannot rest on the private 
judgment of any individual 
(i.e., feelings of offense). If it 
did, then we would, in effect, 
have no rights at all, because 
whatever provisional exercise 
of freedom we undertook would 
depend on the actual assent of 
other individuals. We would 
need to beg the permission of 
every Christian to criticize the 

Defense of Marriage Act, of 
every ROTC officer to criticize 
the military and so on.

This isn’t to say the cultural 

libertarian 
approach 
is 

correct, however. To avoid that 
conclusion, 
we 
must 
justify 

speech restrictions on some 
other ground that appeals to 
public reason. We must situate 
our system of right within some 
principle that holds value as a 
reason for every individual who 
is bound by this code of conduct. 
It must proceed from the very 
idea of students as rights-bearers 
(that is, as individuals deserving 
of respect).

Insofar as the University is 

bound to secure a condition of 
equal rights for its students, 
speech that renders the freedom 
and dignity of students insecure 
cannot be justified, since it would 
allow some students to place 
others in a position of moral 
inequality. Threats, harassment 
and speech that impugn the 
honor 
of 
students 
(either 

individually or collectively, as 
in posters disparaging Black 
students as innately criminal) 
make it impossible for students 
to live in a rightful condition. 
“Hate speech,” which aims to 
undermine the condition of 
moral equality, must be stopped 
and punished for the same 
reason that seditious speech, 
which aims to undermine the 
lawful condition of the state 
itself, must be punished: It’s 
incompatible 
with 
the 
very 

conception of right itself.

Such an account is important 

because it makes no reference 
either to particular goals to 
be pursued through speech 
(i.e., social justice) or to effects 
caused by speech (i.e., offense-
taking, 
even 
“insecurity”). 

It’s ideologically neutral and 
respects the rights of each, 
including 
dissenting 
voices 

(there would be no cause, 
for instance, to ban speakers 
for 
campus 
on 
ideological 

grounds). It’s the only regulatory 
framework compatible with the 
very idea of dignity itself — both 
the freedom to be controversial 
and the right of moral equality.

A philosophy of free speech 

 The realities of womanhood

S

ometimes, I think that 
when I become a mother, 
I don’t want to have a girl.

You see, my own 

mother is a worrier. 
For as long as I 
can remember, she 
sheltered my sister 
and me from the 
world, warning us 
of potential dangers 
that lurked in the 
least 
expected 

places. I was taught 
to never open the 
front door unless I 
was absolutely certain who was 
standing on the other side. The 
darkness held an indeterminable 
number of dangers, no safe place 
for a young girl. Sleepovers at 
my friends’ houses were iffy if 
they had brothers or fathers. In 
her eyes, anyone could be a “bad 
guy,” and I learned to approach 
the world with wariness.

My friends would laugh at this 

seemingly unnecessary caution 
— and sometimes I would, too. 
As 17 years passed by without 
much incidence, I attributed 
my mom’s seemingly endless 
worries to mere paranoia. It 
wasn’t until I came to Ann Arbor 
that I realized that my mother’s 
concerns were not, in fact, 
baseless. Rather, my friends and 
I were just privileged enough to 
consider them so.

Ann Arbor is far from being 

considered a “dangerous” city, 
but compared to my hometown of 
Troy, Mich., it might as well be. 
Troy’s claim to fame is being the 
safest city in Michigan and one of 
the safest cities in the country. 
We grew up in the lap of privilege, 
but perhaps it disadvantaged us in 
a way as well, for our upbringing 
blinded us to the fact that most 
of the rest of the world is not so 
kind — especially for us girls.

Coming to a politically charged 

campus unafraid to have open 
conversations 
about 
subjects 

that could be considered taboo, I 

realized how naive I’d 
been to think that the 
world would protect 
me. Because as long as 
celebrities like Donald 
Trump excuse sexual 
assault 
as 
“locker-

room talk” and songs 
insinuating 
rape 

like 
“Blurred 
Lines” 

skyrocket to popularity, 
rape culture grows and 
women are not safe.

It terrifies me, as a woman, that 

a man who speaks so callously 
of attempted rape is a legitimate 
candidate 
for 
president. 
We 

already live in a world where 
known rapists walk free after 
serving a mere three months of a 
six-month sentence. Will we have 
any justice at all if a man accused 
multiple times of sexual assault 
assumes the highest office in the 
nation? Will we ever be safe?

Trump seems to believe that 

equating his boastings of his 
unwanted advances on women 
to “locker-room banter” makes it 
acceptable — a loosely disguised 
version of “boys will be boys” — but 
that only further perpetuates rape 
culture, letting boys believe that 
it’s OK to objectify and degrade 
women in the safety of the men’s 
locker room. It’s ignorant to think 
that what’s said in the locker room 
stays there — and when it leaves, 
that’s when it becomes dangerous.

One late bus ride, I was witness 

to some “harmless locker-room 
talk,” and it made my skin crawl. 
As a raucous group of boys 
stumbled onto the bus behind 
me, their chatter melted into the 
background until one voice cut 
through the rest: “Dude, I’ve 
got to fuck Abby. She is beyond 
hot.” Their conversation quickly 
changed topic, but that comment 

lingered with me, leaving me sick 
to the stomach. Sure, it was just 
“locker-room banter,” but it had 
darker insinuations: that a woman 
is only good for her looks and 
sex, that sex is for a man’s taking. 
The fact that this conversation 
is commonplace is very telling 
of a culture slowly becoming 
desensitized to subtle misogyny.

As much as I’d love to take a 

scenic stroll through the Arb, the 
recent DPSS crime alert about a 
sexual assault in the Arb chills 
me. My mother frantically called 
me when she heard of the assault, 
and I knew then why she’d trained 
my sister and me to be always 
cautious, 
never 
too 
trusting. 

“What the heck? Who does that? 
Who just punches a random girl 
in the face?” I asked my friend, 
horrified that it’d happened so 
close to home, horrified that 
my mother’s fears were not 
unfounded. 
Troy 
may 
have 

shielded me from “the real world,” 
but this incident opened my eyes to 
the very real dangers around me — 
the most prevalent of all being the 
normalization of sexual violence. 
Who just punches a random girl in 
the face? Well, in this day and age, 
it could be anyone: a boy on the 
bus, a star collegiate swimmer, the 
potential future president of the 
United States.

These days, I try not to roll 

my eyes when my mom calls me 
nightly, panicking whenever I 
reveal I’m still in the library past 
dark. She doesn’t rest until she 
knows I’m safe in my dorm. I 
assure her that I’m fine, that I have 
a male friend to walk back with — 
and when I do, I think about his 
mother: how lucky she is that she 
has two boys.

The truth on guns is bipartisan

V

ery rarely do we have 
a 
civilized 
discussion 

about gun control in our 

nation, and perhaps rightfully so. 
It is easy to see why this debate 
sparks such impassioned pleas 
from both ends of the 
political 
spectrum, 

as 
both 
parties 

believe 
that 
the 

other is attempting 
to infringe on the 
fundamental rights 
of American citizens. 
Opponents of gun 
control 
measures 

believe 
that 
their 

Second Amendment 
rights are effectively 
being abolished through such 
restrictive 
measures, 
while 

proponents feel that thousands 
of Americans are losing their 
right to life due to senseless gun 
violence every year.

It is difficult to approach a topic 

of this magnitude with a level 
head, as our judgment is often 
clouded by our own preconceived 
notions. So maybe it’s time that 
we take a different approach. 
One of the first things taught in 
any introductory science class 
is to never take things at face 
value; rather, we must block out 
all the outlandish claims that we 
hear on a daily basis and focus 
on the data. If we take the time 
to fact-check and replicate every 
step and finding of a scientific 
study, why would we approach 
an issue with the society-altering 
consequences of gun control 
with any less caution? They say 
numbers never lie, so perhaps it’s 
time that we listen to them.

Yet sadly, the numbers will be 

nearly impossible to hear, because, 
well, they barely exist. Though 
the question of gun control has 
been at the forefront of American 
society for decades now, virtually 
no government-funded data exists 
on the effect that guns have on 
violence in our country, as the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has essentially been 
banned from studying the impact 
of gun violence since the passage 
of the Dickey Amendment in 
1996. The amendment, which 
was added into an omnibus 
spending bill in 1996 after heavy 
NRA lobbying, states that “none 
of the funds made available for 

injury prevention and control at 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention may be used 
to advocate or promote gun 
control.” Though this clause does 
not explicitly state that studying 

gun 
violence 
is 

illegal, the underlying 
message 
was 
made 

clear to researchers 
when the budget of the 
CDC was cut by the 
exact amount of money 
that it had spent on gun 
violence studies in the 
previous year.

Some 
will 
claim 

that this makes perfect 
sense: 
Why 
should 

the Centers for Disease Control 
study guns? They certainly aren’t 
a disease. Yet the jurisdiction of 
the CDC doesn’t stop at diseases; 
it extends to all major health 
risks facing the American public, 
including automobile safety and 
other health risks as well. Putting 
individual opinions on gun control 
aside, it is certainly clear that gun 
violence is a public health risk to 
the American people. Between 
2009 and 2013, more than 44,000 
gun-related 
murders 
were 

committed in the United States, a 
number that ignores other forms 
of gun-related deaths. This issue 
seems to be a distinctly American 
one, as a recent study has shown 
that the United States has a gun 
homicide rate more than 25 times 
higher than other high-income 
countries. With such an alarmingly 
high rates of gun violence in our 
country, it seems that we should 
investigate all possible causes and 
remedies for this epidemic.

Even Jay Dickey, the former 

Republican congressman who 
first introduced this ban and a 
lifelong member of the NRA, has 
seen his opinion shift in recent 
years, stating the reasons for 
his evolution on gun violence 
research in an op-ed for The 
Washington Post:

U.S. scientists cannot answer 

the most basic question: What 
works to prevent firearm injuries? 
We don’t know whether having 
more citizens carry guns would 
decrease 
or 
increase 
firearm 

deaths.... What we do know is that 
firearm injuries will continue to 
claim far too many lives at home, 
at school, at work and at the 

movies until we start asking and 
answering the hard questions.

As Mr. Dickey demonstrated, 

uncovering the truth should not 
be a partisan issue. Regardless of 
how you or I may feel on the issue 
of gun control, we all have a vested 
interest in knowing the reality of 
what we’re facing when it concerns 
the safety of the American people. 
If the CDC is able to conduct a 
study that demonstrates that the 
presence of guns in a country 
does not lead to more violence, 
gun enthusiasts may rejoice and 
claim that they’ve been correct all 
along. If the opposite is found, then 
proponents of gun control may do 
the same. The point is: If the NRA 
and those who oppose tighter gun 
restrictions truly believe their 
positions are justified, then these 
parties would have nothing to 
lose if data on the impact of guns 
was made available. While data 
from the federal government may 
reveal that gun advocates must 
swallow their pride and admit 
their position is unjustified, this 
would certainly be a small price 
to pay for uncovering data that 
could potentially save thousands 
of American lives every single year.

The only way that we as a 

nation can even begin to tackle the 
complex issue that is gun violence 
in our country is to understand its 
roots — a task that is impossible 
without comprehensive data and 
scientific studies. Without this 
data we are fighting a losing battle, 
lives will continue to be lost and 
we as a nation will be no closer 
to having any real solutions, or 
even a meaningful discussion for 
that matter. While we continue to 
squabble and bicker over who is to 
blame, innocent people are dying, 
and I can guarantee you that 
each and every life lost is much 
more than a mere statistic to the 
loved ones of the deceased. We 
owe it to these victims and their 
families to do everything in our 
power to figure out why this type 
of bloodshed continues to occur. I 
strongly urge you to contact your 
state representatives and let them 
know that you support repealing 
the Dickey Amendment. Trying 
to save lives should be bipartisan.

HBO

“I couldn’t help but wonder, is divorce the new marriage?”

There’s something to be said 

for dark comedies. The trend 
toward greater realism in the 
recent slew of fall comedies, 
like FX’s “Better 
Things,” 
could 

be an indication 
of 
the 
desire 

to see our own 
human 
flaws 

and 
everyday 

realities laid bare 
on screen. With 
HBO’s 
newest 

comedy “Divorce,” 
however, there are 
realities 
better 

left unshown.

The series follows a couple, 

Frances (Sarah Jessica Parker, 
“Sex and the City”) and Robert 
(Thomas 
Haden 
Church, 

“Easy A”), through a lengthy, 
tumultuous divorce. But rather 
than providing a poignant look 
into the lives of two people who, 
against all odds, have decided 
to call it quits, the series is a 
dismal portrait of two self-
centered middle-aged people 
who are too consumed with 
themselves to make any effort 
in their relationship.

This is apparently reason 

enough for Frances to reevaluate 
her life and her marriage, 
following a jarring incident 
at her friend Diane’s (Molly 
Shannon, “Wet Hot American 
Summer: First Day of Camp”) 
50th birthday party. It’s not 
clear in the episode why Frances 
and Robert’s marriage suddenly 
crumbles before our eyes. Yes, 
the two main characters are 
flawed, and yes, there is some 
deep-seated 
unhappiness, 
as 

with many marriages, but there 
aren’t any significant points of 
contention 
between 
Frances 

and Robert. Rather than seeing 
a 
meaningful 
problem 
that 

antagonizes their relationship, 
we get a scene that shows their 
close friends, Diane and her 
husband Nick (Tracy Letts, 
“The Big Short”), erupting in 
a violent conflict that spurs 
Frances’s uncertainty regarding 
her marriage.

Frances 
doesn’t 
waste 
a 

moment after her revelation. 
While Robert still reels from 
the events that take place just 
moments before, Frances gives 

it to him straight. In a more 
convoluted version of the “It’s 
not you, it’s me” break-up 
speech, Frances articulates her 
dissatisfaction — something that 
comes as a complete surprise 
to Robert. In this moment, it’s 

apparent 
that 

Frances 
spends 

a 
lot 
of 
time 

thinking 
about 

herself. While the 
verbiage she uses 
implies some level 
of soul-searching, 
it’s 
obvious 

that 
she 
hasn’t 

considered 
the 

implications.

From 
this 

moment 
on, 
Frances 
only 

becomes 
more 
unlikable. 

Though the motivation behind 
her crisis isn’t clear at first, 
her selfishness is immediately 
clear. This isn’t helped by the 
fact that after the first act, 
we’re introduced to the man 
she’s having an affair with, 
Julian 
(Jemaine 
Clement, 

“What We Do in the Shadows”), 
who’s 
equally 
self-centered. 

It’s the thought of Julian that 
comforts Frances when her 
friend Dallas (Talia Balsam, 
“No Strings Attached”) warns 
that divorcing her husband 
will leave her feeling lonely 
(side note: Frances’s only other 
close friend is a bitter divorcée 
— another demonstration of 
the show’s lack of subtlety and 
ingenuity).

After leaving her husband, 

Frances goes to Julian expecting 
him to welcome the news 
with 
excitement. 
However, 

he’s predictably freaked out 
by the sudden serious turn 
their relationship has taken. 
Again, Frances demonstrates 
her complete lack of empathy 
towards the people in her 
life she depends on most — a 
highly unappealing quality in a 
protagonist. When it becomes 
clear to Frances that her plan 
to leave Robert and be with 
Julian won’t go as expected, she 
halfheartedly makes amends 
with Robert.

There is nothing respectable 

about her decision, but it’s 
understandable considering her 
circumstances. Not everyone 
is 
strong 
enough 
to 
make 

the 
kind 
of 
self-sacrificing 

decisions that often need to 

be made. The show isn’t asking 
us to sympathize with her, 
but to understand her. If this 
is the kind of character that 
embodies the gritty storytelling 
pervasive in TV today, then 
shows that utilize this type 
of characterization need to 
work a lot harder to sustain 
our attention. It’s difficult to 
become invested in a character 
that we resent. Frances doesn’t 
possess the kind of complexity 
that 
flavors 
her 
character 

and story with just enough 
contradiction to be interesting. 
She’s 
unsophisticated, 

motivated by selfishness, and 
completely unlikable.

That isn’t to say that Robert 

is likable, exactly. We’re almost 
tricked into siding with him 
when he candidly points out 
to Frances that “The crisis at 
Nick and Diane’s is the kind of 
stuff that’s supposed to bring us 
together.” But the show quickly 
reveals its hand when Robert 
proves to be just as petty as his 
soon-to-be ex-wife.

It’s hard not to compare a new 

HBO show about relationships 
starring Sarah Jessica Parker to 
“Sex and the City.” The parallels 
that can be drawn between the 
two are mostly superficial. The 
protagonist, 
an 
independent 

woman, struggles with a failing 
relationship that highlights her 
greatest flaws and draws out 
extremely unlikable qualities. 
Equally as unlikable is the male 
lead: her husband, a man so 
clueless that he doesn’t realize 
his wife is having an affair.

However, it may be more apt 

to compare the new series to 
HBO’s “Togetherness,” which 
was cancelled following its 
second 
season. 
The 
show’s 

writing was also bound to 
reality and to the complexity 
of 
human 
relationships. 
It 

was dark but sweet, and it 
was relatable. But “Divorce” 
lacks 
the 
self-awareness 

that 
made 
“Togetherness” 

equally as charming as it was 
bleak. “Divorce” attempts to 
counteract its affluent suburban 
desperation 
with 
shallow 

humor, often falling flat. If 
HBO was hoping to replace 
“Togetherness” with a similar 
show with greater star power, 
than “Divorce” is not the ticket.

As in most cases, ‘Divorce’ 
is depressing and unfunny

SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

New HBO dramedy feels like a subversion of ‘Sex and the 
City,’ but without the laughs

ANDERSON .PAAK

Former Daily Arts editor Adam DePollo coming in with subliminal Apple product placement.

Anderson .Paak is a singer and 

multi-instrumentalist who blends 
soul, funk, hip hop and R&B to cre-
ate a warm, timeless sound that’s 
distinctly his own. Knxwledge 
is a technically skilled hip-hop 
producer with a knack for finding 
perfectly obscure 
records to sample 
and 
supporting 

them with crisp, 
thick percussion. 
After 
meeting 

on Twitter, the 
pair released an 
EP under their 
collaborative 
alias, NxWorries, 
in 2013, and though it’s beauti-
ful, its brevity inevitably left fans 
wanting more. Both artists have 
evolved 
independently 
since 

— Anderson .Paak released his 
second solo album, Malibu, ear-
lier this year, while Knxwledge 
produced for Kendrick Lamar 
and Earl Sweatshirt. Another col-
laboration began to feel like fan-
tasy, obviously doomed by tour 
schedules or other complications. 
However, on Friday, NxWorries 
released their first full-length 
LP one week ahead of its sched-
uled arrival on iTunes and Apple 
Music.

Yes Lawd! is a lighthearted 

project and its artists seem at ease, 
like they’re creating music solely 
for the fun of it. Its instrumentals 
archive the brightest sounds of 
earlier eras and Anderson .Paak 
dances atop them, the stages for 
his vocal theatrics. He is a an old-
school emcee: neither rapping nor 
singing exactly, he keeps his tone 
somewhere in between the two 
and still never fails to turn spo-
ken words into song. The album 
opens with a brief skit featuring 
gangster braggadocio, then segues 
into “Livvin,” a proper introduc-

tion on which .Paak delivers soul-
ful, celebratory anecdotes about 
persistence despite hardships and 
drought. The beat is built around 
suspenseful, looping horns and 
.Paak establishes humane sen-
sibility through his affirmation: 
“It ain’t all about the money, you 
dummy / But if it’s out here, why 
don’t you get it?” 

Initially, 
the 
album 
feels 

dedicated 
to 

romancing Anderson 
.Paak’s loved one. 
“Wngs” is a smooth, 
jazzy plea for an 
overdue 
night 

together 
and 
on 

“Best One” he basks 
in her perfection, 
assuring: “I hope I 
never have to cut you 

off / You’re my best one.” “What 
More Can I Say” complicates 
the love story by introducing 
.Paak’s most sensitive relationship 
tendencies — he confesses his 
inability to be leashed, but still 
feels hopelessly attracted to the 
idea of a relationship. On Yes 
Lawd!, Anderson .Paak is not 
just an infatuated poet — he is a 
classically cool male entertainer in 
obvious parallel to Marvin Gaye.

“Lyk Dis” is a confident, 

sensual bedroom rap delivered 
with swagger and sensitivity 
and “Scared Money” campaigns 
for sexual urgency, relying on 
the metaphor “scared money 
don’t make money” to spark an 
immediate fire. On “Starlite,” 
.Paak delivers the album’s most 
technically impressive rap verse, 
bragging over piano and choir 
loops: “I’m nothing like your 
Ken and you got bigger tits than 
Barbie.” His fast words are slyly 
spoken in striking similarity to 
Andre 3K’s prophetic tone on 
“International Player’s Anthem.”

Songs are short and change fre-

quently on Yes Lawd!, often tran-
sitioning through oddly comical 
skits or beat changes that serve as 

interludes. It’s an unconventional 
form for an album, but business as 
usual for Stones Throw Records, 
the independent label that backs 
NxWorries 
and 
many 
other 

underground 
hip-hop 
heroes. 

Their albums are often jumpy and 
packed with quirky skits, which 
could be off-putting if done by an 
unfit producer, but such spaces 
allow Knxwledge to infuse his 
personality with subtlety. “Can’t 
Stop” starts as a hypnotic break-
beat with ad-libs as the only vocal 
accompaniment, then becomes 
moodier, with drippy instru-
mentation and vague, monotone 
singing, before concluding with 
sampled dialogue from the Car-
toon Network show, “Rick and 
Morty.” Anderson .Paak is com-
pletely absent from the song, yet 
every moment is musically excit-
ing. 

Still, 
the 
most 
rewarding 

moments 
arrive 
when 
the 

artists’ 
distinctions 
disappear 

and NxWorries becomes a truly 
combined entity. “Kutless” is a 
smooth, hazy, minimalist ride on 
which Anderson .Paak repeats 
an invitation to “cruise for the 
moment,” and the beat perfectly 
balances his lyrical simplicity. 
Knxwledge and .Paak co-author 
an elaborate musical sketch on 
“H.A.N.,” a shaming of the leeches 
that often ruin the artists’ moods, 
and “Jodi” is a short interlude with 
similar intentions.

Yes Lawd! is half beat tape and 

half 1980s nightclub performance, 
but it’s sharpest when the two 
forms intertwine. The album’s 
epic, “Get Bigger / Do U Luv,” 
offers a bone-chilling reflection 
on .Paak’s steep climb to happi-
ness, then switches into a moody 
sing-song in which he wonders 
emphatically: “Do you love?” Knx-
wledge’s impossibly thick, tex-
tured strings perfectly score the 
serenity. It’s the magical, collabor-
ative masterpiece that we waited 
for, even if it’s only one song.

In Part One of “Dekalog,” 

Irena 
(Maja 
Komorowska, 

“Katyn”) fields questions posed 
by her wide-eyed young nephew 
(Wojciech Klata, “Schindler’s 
List”) — complex ones, about 
God and science, what death is 
and what comes afterward. She 
finishes her explanation and 
pauses. “Do you understand?”

He crinkles his nose. “Not 

really.”

It’s in this hazy space of 

questioning before discovery 
that 
Krzysztof 
Kieslowski’s 

acclaimed “Dekalog” unfolds. 
A Polish television miniseries of 
ten hour-long films based loose-
ly on each of the Ten Command-
ments, “Dekalog” was screened 
at the Michigan Theater last 
weekend as part of a theatrical 
re-release of the 1988 original.

Kieslowski uses the Bible’s 

ethical standards as a point of 
reference to pose philosophi-
cal challenges faced by every-
day Polish citizens. Each film 
is titled only as a number, and 
the Ten Commandments are 

not explicitly referenced. While 
some Commandments corre-
late more strongly with certain 
parts, aspects of its Biblical 
themes are woven into each film. 
Rather than exist to be proven 
or disproven, the Command-
ments sit alongside “Dekalog” ’s 
characters, a springboard from 
which to reflect on their deci-
sions in a philosophical way.

In Part One, a university 

professor trains his precocious 
son in the ways of logic-based 
prediction. The pair develops 
a formula to calculate whether 
the pond’s ice is thick enough to 
skate on. When the temperature 
spikes unexpectedly, the tragic 
consequences throw scientific 
authority into question.

Dorota 
(Krystyna 
Janda, 

“Man of Marble”) trails her 
doctor 
(Wojciech 
Klata, 

“Schindler’s List”) in Part Two, 
asking him to predict whether 
her hospitalized husband will 
survive. His decision holds 
immense consequence. Preg-
nant with another man’s baby, 
Dorota decides that if her hus-
band lives, she will have an 
abortion; if he dies, she will 
keep the baby. The doctor is 

plagued by the knowledge that 
the fate of another human being 
lies in his answer.

Parts Three through Ten 

tackle similarly layered ethi-
cal dilemmas. All films in the 
series are set in the same deso-
late Warsaw apartment com-
plex, where its characters trod 
solemnly through wintry mono-
tone. While the whole series 
was directed and co-written by 
Kieslowski, each film has a dif-
ferent cinematographer, making 
the series feel unique yet cohe-
sive.

“Dekalog” reveals its depth 

slowly, assembling each charac-
ter’s situation carefully before 
peeling it back in layers to reveal 
the moral dilemma at its core. 
Dialogue is sparse, leaving a 
somber silence thick with unan-
swered questions. Kieslowski 
makes a masterpiece out of ordi-
nary existence, grabbing hold of 
emotional threads and teasing 
out what guides pain and love, 
destiny and planning, instinct 
and morality. It’s mentally dense 
stuff, to be sure, but its compre-
hensive execution makes “Deka-
log” well-deserving of its spot in 
the cinematic hall of fame.

BBC FILMS

I’m ready for my close up.

Sergei 
Polunin 
is 
widely 

considered to be one of the most 
talented and interesting ballet 
dancers 
in 
the 

modern 
world. 

A 
prolific 
artist 

who 
has 
soloed 

for packed houses 
at 
London’s 

prestigious 
Royal 

Ballet 
since 
the 

age of 18, Polunin 
has since starred 
in 
dozens 
of 

productions and received acclaim 
from nearly every critic and 
choreographer who has crossed 
his path. He’s dazzled millions 
with his incredible grace, perfect 
technique and mastery of the 
craft.

Polunin is the subject of the 

recently released documentary, 
“Dancer.” Directed by Steven 
Cantor 
(“Blood 
Ties”), 
the 

documentary offers a troubled, 
even unsettling portrait of a 
young 
dancer’s 
past, 
present 

and future. When Polunin was 
nine, his family placed him in an 
intensive ballet school in Kiev. 
To afford his tuition, his father 
and grandparents left Ukraine 
to 
find 
better-paying 
work, 

effectively splitting his family 
apart. When he was 13, Polunin 
began attending the Royal Ballet 
School in London. He was sent to 
England alone, without knowing 
a word of English. In “Dancer,” 

Polunin recalls this as a time of 
deeply rooted fear and stress. 
Any hope for his family’s reunion 
was contingent on his success as a 
dancer, so he practiced and pushed 
himself harder than anyone else 
at his school. By 18, he was the 

youngest principal 
dancer the Royal 
Ballet 
had 
ever 

seen.

What happened 

next should be a 
shock to nobody 
who has grown up 
in the age when 
the 
rebellions 

of 
intensely 

disciplined and controlled child 
stars are on the front cover of 
every magazine. Polunin started 
acting out. He broke down during 
rehearsals, started getting tattoos, 
danced most of his performances 
completely high on cocaine and 
eventually quit the Royal Ballet 
when he was 22.

Polunin’s story is a mix of two 

fairly well-understood narratives: 
ballet as a hyper-disciplined and 
controlled form of prolonged 
mental 
and 
physical 
torture, 

and the consequences of putting 
so much pressure on somebody 
so young. His narrative is a 
dance movie, family drama and 
character study all at once.

Cantor uses this to full effect, 

and every sequence of dance 
or 
emotional 
reveal 
works 

with 
the 
understanding 
that 

for Polunin, there has never 
been any separation between 
the two. There’s a devastating 

reason behind every outburst, 
and every emotion is reflected in 
his dancing. Footage of Polunin 
performing is used carefully, and 
only to underscore a point being 
made about his character or what 
was happening to him at the time.

There are only a few moments 

in the film when we are treated to 
long sequences of Polunin dancing. 
One is during his performance 
of Spartacus in Russia, after he 
had quit the Royal Ballet. By this 
point, Polunin is considering 
quitting dance altogether. Images 
of him attending to his bleeding, 
blistering feet and lying sprawled 
out on the floor in exhaustion are 
intercut with a genuinely beautiful 
performance. He’s in every kind 
of pain possible, and though he 
doesn’t speak much, it’s clear he 
wants out.

And yet, it would be too simple 

a narrative if it were all pain and 
gloom. Though Polunin certainly 
has a complicated relationship to 
dance, it’s evident that there’s a 
real love there. He says it feels like 
flying when it’s good, and when he 
can forget all the pain that pushed 
him onstage.

Throughout the documentary, 

he stops and starts over and over 
again, so you start to get the sense 
that he can’t seem to make himself 
stop. “You feel like a prisoner to 
your body,” Polunin says, “...to the 
urge to dance.”

In other words: he can’t help 

himself. 

In other words: he can’t help 

himself.

“I’m supposed to meet David at this bar.”

One of the peculiar conse-

quences of streaming television 
is the implicit assumption of 
prestige. With a few exceptions, 
series that air on 
platforms 
like 

Netflix, 
Amazon 

Prime 
or 
Hulu 

come presupposed 
with an HBO-like 
sheen of “quality.” 
“House of Cards” 
— despite being, at 
this point, purely 
ludicrous — laid 
down the template for this phe-
nomenon: with its lush production 
values, portentous dialogue and 
overbearing score, the first Netflix 
Original established the trouble-
some precedent for streaming 
shows to be inherently considered 
“prestige TV.”

That’s why Amazon’s “Goli-

ath” is, to be quite honest, kind 
of weird. Created by legal drama 
veteran David E. Kelley (“Ally 
McBeal”), 
the 
show 
centers 

around disgraced attorney Billy 
McBride (Billy Bob Thornton, 
“Fargo”) as he’s persuaded to take 
on an old case involving explod-
ing boats, weapons defense sys-
tems and (somehow?) fish guts. 
McBride is the proverbial David 
to the titular Goliath he’s taking 
on: the law firm that once ousted 
him and still employs his ex-wife, 
Julie (Maria Bello, “Prisoners”). 
There’s a preposterously cartoon 
villain, played by William Hurt 

(“Captain America: Civil War”) 
whose right side of his body is, of 
course, disfigured. Oh, and throw 
in an estranged father-daughter 
relationship for good measure.

The premise is familiar. The 

dialogue is cliché. And, for the 

most part, the char-
acters 
are 
stock 

types. 
Which 
is 

why “Goliath” is 
odd. 
Simply 
the 

description “Ama-
zon drama starring 
Billy Bob Thorn-
ton” is enough to 
generate 
excite-

ment on its own, 

but the show looks and feels like 
little more than a serialized net-
work procedural. Save for the 
judiciously deployed F-bombs and 
the lack of a “case-of-the-week” 
structure, there’s no reason this 
show couldn’t have aired on CBS.

But there’s something to be 

said for Kelley’s more middlebrow 
intentions. While it feels, at times, 
like a poor man’s “Terriers” — a 
cancellation that should remain 
a huge stain on the collective TV 
industry’s conscience — “Goliath” 
might be on to something. There’s 
a sense of comfort in knowing 
exactly what these characters are 
going to say when they admonish 
Billy for his excessive drinking, 
or being able to predict, correctly, 
that the young associate with the 
stutter will be the one chosen to 
spearhead the case. The standard 
beats are hit, and they’re hit hard. 
There’s a reason this formula is 
so successful; it’s just jarring, and 

potentially revolutionary, to expe-
rience it on a streaming network.

The show’s most attractive 

draws, then, are its lead perfor-
mances. Little else is more grati-
fying than hearing Thornton’s 
folksy, Southern-inflected voice 
spout lines like, “I’m not some sort 
of gardener rapist,” and, “Let’s go 
be pals and shit.” As evidenced by 
his turn in “Fargo,” he can hide 
considerable menace behind his 
easy charm. And Nina Arianda 
(“Florence Foster Jenkins”) is 
surprisingly effective as the ener-
getic, exasperated and wonder-
fully named Patty Solis-Papagian. 
Bello, meanwhile, elevates what 
she can with an ex-wife archetype 
— though she does figure promi-
nently in the plot — and Molly 
Parker (“House of Cards”) does 
her best in a somewhat out-of-
place lawyer role.

One has to wonder how much 

money Thornton, Bello and their 
similarly esteemed colleagues 
were offered. Was it simply the 
sheen of prestige, of “streaming 
on Amazon Prime” that lured 
them in? Because “Goliath,” 
save for a typically charismatic 
Thornton 
performance, 
is 
a 

particularly inoffensive offering 
in the streaming wars. The 
effect is odd, like expecting “The 
Night Of” and instead getting 
“Damages.” 
Thus, 
“Goliath” 

is a strange entity: it’s to be 
commended for being thoroughly 
secure in its middling ambitions, 
but it’s also of a template that’s 
been done before — and better — 
many times over.

To say “Hamilton” has explod-

ed like no other Broadway show 
in recent memory might be an 
understatement. The show took 
Broadway by storm, 
breaking box office 
records for the Rich-
ard Rodgers The-
atre and winning 
11 
Tony 
Awards. 

It’s also entrenched 
itself 
into 
main-

stream 
culture, 

with the cast album 
constantly holding 
a place on the Bill-
board Top 200 Albums and iTunes 
Best Sellers charts. So it’s only 
natural that the hysteria spread 
to television, taking the form of a 
documentary by PBS’s long-run-
ning “Great Performances” series, 
who made a similar doc for com-
poser Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In 
The Heights” several years ago.

For “Hamilton” fans, this docu-

mentary is going to be yet another 
way to interact with the show they 
love. It’s not as much a technical 
breakdown of the show’s history, 
though, as a look inside how the 
story of Alexander Hamilton is 
told through this different form 
of storytelling. Though it did leave 
me wanting more stories about 
the show’s production, it’s still a 
fascinating look into how the life 
of “The $10 founding father with-
out a father” was brought to life 
onstage.

The main story “Hamilton’s 

America” tells is how the music 
and other content of “Hamilton” 

relate to the life of Alexander 
Hamilton. It intersperses details 
of Hamilton’s life with clips of the 
staging and music from the musi-
cal. Ron Chernow, the author of 
the biography on which the show 
is based, is our main guide through 
the history and adds substantial 

insight to the his-
torical 
details. 

The film also fea-
tures 
politicians 

from both sides of 
the aisle talking 
about the impact 
of Hamilton on 
our 
government. 

Everyone 
from 

Speaker 
of 
the 

House Paul Ryan 

and President George W. Bush 
to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren 
(D-Mass.) share their two cents 
about Hamilton. There’s also an 
extended sequence where Miran-
da interviews President Barack 
Obama (on the day of the cast and 
crew’s visit to the White House) 
illustrating just how important 
this show is.

Still, the best moments of the 

documentary come from when the 
cast talk about their characters. 
The documentary mixes actors’ 
talking heads with clips of them 
performing the songs. Watching 
Leslie Odom Jr. (the original 
Aaron Burr) and Chris Jackson 
(who 
currently 
plays 
George 

Washington) sing and bring their 
songs to life is amazing. Hearing 
Daveed Diggs (who originated 
the roles of Lafayette and Thomas 
Jefferson) 
and 
Jackson 
talk 

about how their characters were 
imperfect people (and owned 
slaves) are emotionally powerful 

moments. 
There’s 
one 
scene 

in particular where Jackson is 
standing in the slave quarters 
at Mount Vernon, talking about 
how he can’t ignore the moral 
imperfections about his character.

Where I wanted a little more 

from the documentary was a more 
in depth look into the success of 
the show and the consequences 
of that success. There are some 
wonderful talking heads from 
Miranda where he discusses the 
impact the show had on his life, 
and there are a few great shots of 
the adoring throngs of fans at the 
“Ham4Ham” lottery shows, a few 
brief clips from the Tonys and of 
the opening night parties both on 
and off Broadway. However, there 
are a few other stories that remain 
untold. One major one is the battle 
between the cast and producers 
for a percentage of the show’s 
backend that occurred early in 
the Broadway run and set a new 
precedent for major Broadway 
shows. It’s not surprising that a 
documentary would want to avoid 
talking about one of the show’s 
biggest controversies given that 
“Hamilton” ’s producer Jeffrey 
Seller is a producer on the actual 
documentary. Still, it’s definitely 
a story that would benefit from 
the inside look this documentary 
provides.

However, those are the nitpicky 

points about what is otherwise 
a fascinating look into one of 
the biggest musicals Broadway 
has ever seen. As someone who 
loves the show, to learn more 
about how and why the show 
made the choices it did in its 
characterizations and music is a 
splendid way to spend 90 minutes.

Wolverines face in-state rival Michigan Tech

It’s time for Tech week for 

the No. 11 Michigan hockey 
team, and not the theater kind. 
This weekend is the Wolverines’ 
yearly matchup against Michigan 
Tech, which they beat 4-2 last 
season at Joe Louis Arena in 
the Great Lakes Invitational 
Championship.

For 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson, these games have 
become a reunion with longtime 
friend Mel Pearson, who coaches 
the Huskies. Pearson worked as 
an assistant for Berenson from 
1988 — Berenson’s fifth season 
— until 2011 before taking over 
for the Huskies. Once Pearson 
left the Wolverines, Berenson 
has kept a close eye on his 
former assistant.

“Mel 
is 
nearly 
one 
of 

my 
sons,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“Obviously I expected he would 
turn 
that 
program 
around 

… I think he’s trying to build 
another Michigan.”

Since his arrival in Houghton, 

Pearson has earned two WCHA 
Coach of the Year awards, and 
last season, he led Michigan Tech 
to its first WCHA regular-season 
championship since 1975. It was 
no small feat, as Pearson took a 
team that won just four games 
and finished 12th in conference 
play the year before he arrived, 
to the conference championship.

Now with Pearson in his 

sixth season, the Huskies have 
struggled in their first few games, 
sporting a 1-4-1 record. Michigan 
Tech’s offense is anchored by 
two seniors: defenseman Shane 
Hanna and forward Reid Sturos. 
Both Hanna and Sturos have 
netted two goals this season 
and Hanna ranks third in the 
country in blocked shots with 

14. Michigan Tech’s power play, 
though, needs improvement, as 
the Huskies have converted just 
six of their 34 opportunities.

For Michigan (2-1), it’s a 

completely 
different 
story. 

Through two games, it mounted 
only one power-play goal in six 
attempts. Then, in Saturday 
night’s 
2-1 
victory 
against 

Ferris State, the Wolverines 
scored on two of their five 
chances. Freshman center Jake 
Slaker netted one of the two 
goals — the first of his career. 
Through three games, Slaker 
has found his place on the first 
line, growing more and more 
comfortable with the puck as 

he leads the Wolverines in shots 
with 11. Slaker’s performance 
in last week’s game earned 
him First Star 
recognition from 
the Big Ten.

“He played an 

extra year in the 
(United 
States 

Hockey League) 
and I think he’s 
a 
little 
more 

mature 
than 

a player who’s 
coming in as a 
true freshman,” 
Berenson said. “He’s got a leg up 
in that area. “He’s a good two-
way player, and right now, he’s 

off to a pretty good start.”

Added Slaker: “Of course we 

want to play on the offensive 

side of the puck, 
but we have to 
take care of the 
defensive 
zone 

first, 
because 

that’s the most 
important 
zone 

and that’s where 
you 
start 
to 

create offense.”

Success 
on 

the power play 
certainly helped 

the Wolverines, but they also 
received 
invaluable 
support 

from 
freshman 
goaltender 

Jack LaFontaine in the crease. 
LaFontaine saved 28 shots and 
allowed only one goal, while Ferris 
State was on the power play.

“It gives us a lot of confidence,” 

Slaker said. “If it wasn’t for him, 
we maybe wouldn’t have the 
same outcome in that game. 
When 
you 
have 
the 
goalie 

making saves, it makes your job 
a lot easier up front.”

It is currently a mystery who 

Michigan will be starting in 
the net this weekend, though 
LaFontaine 
demonstrated 

he is more than capable. The 
Wolverines 
could 
also 
start 

freshman Hayden Lavigne — 
who earned his first career 

shutout against Union — or 
senior Zach Nagelvoort, who, 
despite allowing four goals two 
weeks ago, notched 36 saves.

Senior Max Shuart is another 

center who has played well this 
season, dishing out a team-high 
three assists and holding a +2 plus/
minus, which ranks second on the 
team. After playing on a line with 
freshman forward James Sanchez 
and fellow senior forward Evan 
Allen for the Wolverines’ first 
three games, Shuart practiced 
with Allen and junior left wing 
Dexter Dancs this week — his 
grouping from last season.

“It’s nice to play with guys 

you’ve had some chemistry with 
previously,” Shuart said. “Dexter, 
Evan and I work pretty well 
together, so hopefully we’ll pick 
up tomorrow right where we left 
off and have a good weekend.

“It’s nice to know where 

they’re going to be on the ice. If 
we know each other’s games, we 
can work well together off that.”

Though 
the 
CCHA 
no 

longer exists, the yearly games 
between 
Michigan 
and 
the 

Huskies still have meaning for 
the two in-state rivals. This 
upcoming weekend will be the 
222nd and 223rd times the two 
have faced off. The last time the 
two squads played at Yost Ice 
Arena, the Wolverines came out 
with a 2-1 victory.

And for the first time in three 

years, the teams return once again 
to Ann Arbor, on homecoming 
weekend nonetheless.

“We know the atmosphere 

is going to be there, and we 
definitely have to start with 
Friday night and hope to get the 
big ‘W,’ ” Slaker said. “We’re very 
excited about it. Us freshmen are 
super excited to have our first 
(home) game against an intra-
state squad.”

“Mel is 

nearly one of 

my sons.”

Michigan Ultras remain supportive

It’s a cold Wednesday night 

at 
U-M 
Soccer 
Stadium. 
A 

steady rain streams down and 
will continue to do so all night. 
It’s the kind of night that leads 
most students to huddle in their 
dorms or in the library. But from 
the stands in the middle of the 
field streams the distinctly loud 
beating of a drum.

The drum, perhaps more aptly 

identifiable as a glorified paint 
bucket, serves as a rallying cry 
for the nearly 100 voices that 
will continue to drown out any 
ill effects that the raw weather 
might bring. The bucket would 
later crack — hardly out of the 
ordinary — only to be used until 
the tattered remnants cease to 
produce the coveted noise. 

“We love you, we love you, 

we love you,” chants the group 
in unison. “Where you go we’ll 
follow, we’ll follow, we’ll follow, 
because we support the victors, 
the victors, the victors, and that’s 
the way we like it.”

And follow they do.
They’re not just here for 

this game against Detroit — 
Michigan’s first victory of the 
season. They will be back for the 
women’s game against Rutgers 
the next day. And for the men’s 
game against Penn State just 
days later. And for each game 
after, cheering with the same 
unbridled passion as ever.

The 
group 
of 
supporters, 

known as the Michigan Ultras, 
was started in 2010 with the 
intention of unifying students 
at 
Michigan 
who 
love 
the 

Wolverines’ soccer program. The 
now 1,000-plus students who are 
members of the group have sets 
of cheers, rituals and traditions 
with the goal of supporting both 
Michigan soccer teams, and 
occasionally antagonizing their 
opponents.

“Really it’s just a group of 

people who love soccer and love 
Michigan, and love to bring the 
best environment to the games 

as possible,” said junior Jack 
Googasion, the president of the 
Ultras, on Oct. 8. “It’s really clear 
to see that when we bring our best, 
the team responds equitably.” 

They may not get the fame of 

the football student section or 
have the name recognition of the 
Maize Rage, but the Michigan 
Ultras 
believe 

they 
have 
as 

much passion as 
anyone. 

“It’s a more 

intimate 
group 

of 
people, 
but 

its a passionate 
group of people 
who just want to 
see the team do 
well,” Googasian 
said.

It’s 
that 

passion that leads to making a 
sign with a baby picture of one of 
the opposing players, only to be 
coupled with a chant of, “This is 

a face only a mother could love.” 

The same passion compels 

them to create a sign depicting 
senior midfielder James Murphy 
as LeBron “King” James. 

And it’s that passion that 

leads 
even 
the 
most 
even-

keeled members to spend hours 
researching the opposing teams 

as if preparing 
for 
an 
exam, 

looking for any 
minute 
detail 

that can be used 
as 
ammunition, 

often toeing the 
fine line between 
rowdiness 
and 

vulgarity.

“Our favorite 

thing to do is look 
up their Twitter 
information 
if 

it’s not private, or —” Googasian 
said, suddenly glowing with 
excitement, “what’s really funny 
is if we can get their Tinder 

profiles.” 

And when the Ultras invariably 

cross that line, they know event 
staff will remind them “that 
there are little children around” 
and they need to tone it down.

Throughout the men’s soccer 

season 
largely 
marred 
by 

frustration, as the Wolverines 
are now 2-8-4, the support has 
remained steadfast.

After a recent loss to No. 2 

Notre Dame that sent Michigan 
to 2-7-1, the entire team walked 
over to the Ultras and sang “The 
Victors” together as a show of 
appreciation.

“We’re having quite a difficult 

season so far,” said senior 
captain Lars Eckenrode. “But 
to see them sticking it out 10 
minutes after the game was 
over, those are the little things 
you need to pick you up after 
you’re crushed about a defeat. 
These guys care so much. (Their 
support) is massive.”

Student section’s fandom, chants stay strong despite rough season for men’s team

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines’ first commit 
faces high expectations

It takes a special talent to 

be recognized by a Division 
I program as a freshman in 
high school. For that freshman 
to make a commitment to an 
NCAA tournament team is 
even more impressive.

More than three long years 

after she first pledged her 
allegiance to the Wolverines, 
freshman 
guard 
Akienreh 

Johnson from Toledo, Ohio, is 
finally starting her first season 
for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team.

“I just want to help the team 

out,” Johnson said. “I’ve been 
committed here for a while and 
each year I just (couldn’t) wait 
to come out on the floor and 
help the team out.”

While 
finalizing 
her 

decision to come to Michigan 
was a relief for Johnson, she 
didn’t ease up at all on the 
court. She made the All-City 
first team three times (2013-15) 
and flourished her junior year 
as the Ohio Division II Player 
of the Year (2015), but it took 
some extra effort.

“Being 
committed 
before 

my sophomore year made me a 
target,” Johnson said. “So I was 
a target for three years in high 
school. And it’s hard because 
most kids are mean. They try 
and take you out. They try to 
do whatever they can just to 
beat you. ‘Oh she’s going to 
Michigan? I have to go at her.’ 
That’s a harder target than just, 
‘Oh she has 15 offers, she’s not 
committed yet.’ ”

The increased adversity that 

Johnson faced didn’t make her 
determination to be a Wolverine 
falter, though. In fact, she was 
enthusiastic about convincing 
other recruits to join her on a 
future Michigan roster.

“It was kind of weird talking 

to other recruits,” Johnson 
said. “Because I’m like, ‘Well 
you should come here! I came 
here, I got it, you should get 
it.’ … I’ve been committed here 
longer than most of the juniors 
here, so it just shows how much 
I believe in this program.”

During the state playoffs 

of her junior year, Johnson 
averaged 14.5 points and 7.0 
rebounds before suffering a 
knee injury. She wasn’t able 
to play a full season as a high 
school 
senior, 
so 
her 
full 

potential has yet to be realized. 
This season will be a transition 
for her — more so than the other 
freshmen — because of the 
overlap between her recovery 
period and her senior season.

“Sometimes with some of 

the younger kids, when you 
change the speed and you 
change the strength it takes 
a little bit of time to adjust to 
that,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “So (for) 
our freshmen, it takes time 
to adjust to the speed and the 
strength of the practices at 
this level.”

Johnson’s early commitment 

and the subsequent intensified 
pressure 
from 
opponents 

may 
turn 
into 
her 
secret 

weapon. It proves that she’s 
able to handle adversity and 
adapt accordingly, which — if 
the Wolverines are lucky — 
will translate into an easier 
adjustment to the faster-paced 
collegiate level. If nothing else, 
Johnson has had adequate time 
to mentally prepare to play 
for Michigan. And so far, her 
excitement for the upcoming 
season has not wavered.

“We all talk about our dreams 

and our goal of winning,” 
Johnson said. “This will be the 
first year I’m not in the stands. 
I’m actually playing. Playing 
rather than watching is just 10 
times better.”

Three-plus years after commitment, 
Akienrieh Johnson finally ready to play

The legend of Spike Albrecht continues at Purdue

It’s been 1,292 days since Spike 

Albrecht cemented himself into 
Michigan basketball lore with a 
17-point first-half performance in 
the 2013 National Championship 
Game.

It seems hard to believe that 

after all the time has passed since 
that legendary night in Atlanta, 
the 23-year-old is gearing up 
for yet another season of college 
basketball. But an even more 
incredible sight will be Albrecht 
in a Purdue uniform rather than 
the Wolverine one he donned for 
the previous four years.

Albrecht was granted a release 

from Michigan in late March 
after coming to a decision with 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
that there were more ample 
opportunities for him to find 
regular playing time elsewhere.

Under the NCAA’s graduate 

transfer 
rule, 
Albrecht 
was 

eligible to play immediately 
without having to sit out a 
year, essentially making him 
a free agent. After reportedly 
considering 
schools 
such 
as 

Indiana, Wichita State, Texas 
A&M and Syracuse, the 5-foot-11 
guard landed in West Lafayette, 
just an hour’s drive south of his 
hometown of Crown Point, Ind.

It wasn’t a hard sell for 

Purdue coach Matt Painter to 
convince Albrecht to join the 
Boilermakers. With only one 
point guard on the roster, Painter 
could offer Albrecht the playing 
time he desired.

“I think we needed him,” 

Painter said at last week’s Big 
Ten 
basketball 
media 
day. 

“We had one point guard in 
PJ Thompson, who we felt 
like could grow into a point 
guard, but right now we felt 
like he was more of a scorer. 
So we needed two good point 
guards. Obviously, (Albrecht) 
is familiar with us playing 
in the Big Ten. What you’d 
normally sell to somebody, he 
already knew about us. He knew 

our reputation. He knew our 
program. He had respect for our 
program.”

Since the announcement of 

his decision in May, Albrecht has 
been working with the Purdue 
staff to make strides toward full 
health. When the Boilermakers 
traveled to Spain to play four 
games 
over 
the 
summer, 

Albrecht saw his first minutes 
of competitive basketball since 
a hip injury last December 
prematurely ended his senior 
season with Michigan.

Painter still doesn’t think 

Albrecht is back to 100 percent, 
but has seen improvement since 
the trip to Spain.

“He’s been a lot better in 

practice now than he had been 
in practice in the summer,” 
Painter said. “He’s had a lot of 
rest, and it took him some time 
to get going. We lift a lot, and I 

think that was an adjustment 
for him. We’re not trying to get 
him to a magic level, we’re just 
trying to get him healthy and 
feel good about himself.”

While it remains to be seen if 

Albrecht will be healthy enough to 
make an impact on the court when 
Purdue opens its season Nov. 
11, he’s already helped Painter 
establish a winning mindset in a 
young Boilermaker squad.

“He has a calming influence,” 

Painter said of Albrecht. “He’s 
confident in his abilities. He 
has a lot of experience. He’s 
been through adversity. But he’s 
about winning, and you can’t 
have enough guys that are about 
that.”

* * *

It may seem at this point 

that Albrecht and Purdue form 

a 
perfect 
match, 
but 
some 

controversy 
over 
the 
inter-

conference move and graduate 
transfer policy still lingers.

Albrecht is the second player 

in as many years who has left 
Michigan to play his final year 
of eligibility elsewhere in the Big 
Ten, following Max Bielfeldt’s 
move to Indiana in 2015.

The NCAA’s graduate transfer 

rule is highly scrutinized by 
many coaches, including Beilein 
and Painter, for creating a 
separate market for immediately 
eligible transfers that essentially 
makes seniors with a remaining 
year of eligibility free agents.

“I don’t like the rule, but I 

don’t make the rules. So I just 
abide by them,” Painter said. 
“I can’t change the rule, but if 
they put me in charge, I would. 
I don’t think there’s anything 
wrong with (fifth-year transfers) 

leaving, but I think they should 
sit a year like anybody else. It 
just makes it free agency. A lot 
of people look at us differently 
because we keep doing it. But the 
market sets itself. I don’t set the 
market. I don’t make the rules, 
but I’m going to do everything 
in my power within the rules to 
help Purdue.”

Painter has taken advantage 

of the policy, bringing in three 
players in three years to add 
depth to his squad. This time, 
the 
Purdue 
coach 
further 

capitalized on the rule when 
Beilein made the decision to lift 
restrictions that would have 
stopped Albrecht from going to 
another Big Ten school.

When asked why he chose to 

do so, Beilein made it very clear 
that, to him, Albrecht isn’t just 
another player choosing to walk 
out the door.

“There was a lot of uncertainty 

last year about his health and 
how much (Albrecht) wanted 
to play with (freshman guard) 
Xavier (Simpson) coming in and 
(senior guard) Derrick (Walton) 
coming 
back,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“You just got to go and make 
a call on that. You can’t waffle 
on that. Spike and I had a lot of 
discussion on that. We basically 
said, ‘Ok, we don’t like anything 
about this, but it’s the right thing 
to do for both programs right 
now. Especially for Spike.’ ”

Beilein’s 
admiration 
for 

Albrecht 
created 
a 
difficult 

situation for the Michigan coach. 
Losing someone as experienced 
as Albrecht to a conference foe 
could hurt the Wolverines in 
Big Ten play. But few players 
have earned as much respect 
from Beilein over his three-plus 
decades of coaching as Albrecht 
has, and he wanted nothing but 
the best for the guard no matter 
what decision he made.

When Painter was recruiting 

Albrecht, he saw the difficulty 
the Michigan graduate would 
face putting on a uniform for any 
other team.

That only made him want 

Albrecht more.

“The number one thing that 

was appealing to me about 
Spike was the respect he had for 
Michigan and for Coach Beilein,” 
Painter said. “He wanted to make 
sure that he was professional and 
handled his business correctly 
and did things the right way 
here. That to me stood out, 
because a lot of times when 
guys are moving on, they don’t 
care. He really cared, and it was 
important to him that everybody 
at Michigan knew. He stated, 
‘I wouldn’t be in this position 
if it weren’t for the opportunity 
Michigan gave to me.’”

Albrecht will return to Ann 

Arbor with the Boilermakers on 
Feb. 25, Michigan’s Senior Day. 
And just like Michigan’s seniors, 
he too will have a chance to write 
his final chapter as a Michigan 
basketball legend that day.

Spike Albrecht’s Michigan career ended last year with a season-ending injury, but he has a chance to write one last chapter as a graduate transfer at Purdue.

Michigan hosts Illinois in battle 
of former Super Bowl coaches

The last time Jim Harbaugh 

coached against Lovie Smith, it 
was 2012. Harbaugh was in his 
second year as 
head coach of the 
San 
Francisco 

49ers, and Smith 
was in his ninth 
with the Chicago 
Bears 
— 
two 

years 
removed 

from 
an 
NFC 

Championship 
Game 
appearance and 
six years after 
losing 
Super 

Bowl XLI.

Led by first-

time 
starting 

quarterback 
Colin 
Kaepernick, 

Harbaugh’s 49ers rolled the Bears, 
32-7, and marched all the way to 
that year’s Super Bowl, while Smith 
was fired at the end of the season.

Four 
years 
later, 
the 

circumstances 
have 
changed 

dramatically for both coaches. 
Harbaugh wore out his welcome 
in San Francisco despite reaching 
three straight NFC Championship 
games, and he has moved back to 
his alma mater and resurrected 
Michigan’s football program. And 
Smith, who most recently spent 
two years coaching the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers before being abruptly 
fired again, has returned to the 
state of Illinois in an attempt to 
turn around the 
struggling Fighting 
Illini.

The 
two 

coaches’ 
paths 

will 
cross 
again 

this Saturday at 
Michigan Stadium, 
when they become 
the 
first 
former 

Super 
Bowl 

coaches to face off 
at the college level.

Though Harbaugh claimed not 

to have any memories of coaching 
against Smith in the NFL, it’s a 
matchup he’s looking forward to.

“Great 
coach,” 
he 
said. 

“Outstanding person. Don’t know 
him real well, but I know a lot of 

people that do, and everybody 
speaks very highly of him. Our 
interactions have been pleasant, 
good. Our task is to prepare to play 
their team and it’ll be a challenge 
— big-game, championship-type 
football game for our team, and it’s 
our duty to get prepared for it.”

The Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 

6-0 overall) have said all season 
that they’re treating every game 
like a championship game, but 
this certainly doesn’t look like 
one on paper. Michigan is already 
riding a high in just Harbaugh’s 
second year, as the Wolverines 
boast an undefeated record, the 
nation’s best defense and a top-
10 win over Wisconsin at the 
season’s halfway point.

The Illini (1-2, 2-4), though, 

look like they’re in for a slower 
turnaround. They dropped home 
games to Purdue and Western 
Michigan before finally snapping 
their losing skid with a 17-point win 
against Rutgers — the same team 
Michigan beat 78-0 two weeks ago.

As a result, the Wolverines are 

favored by 37 points Saturday — a 
line that grew wider and wider as 
the week went on.

Still, Illinois presents a few 

threats, especially on defense. 
The Illini are tied for fifth in the 
country with a plus-eight turnover 
margin, buoyed by five takeaways 
against the Scarlet Knights last 
week. Michigan will need to avoid 
making big mistakes, but that 
hasn’t happened very often so far 
this season, as the Wolverines sit at 

a plus-six margin 
heading 
into 

Saturday.

“I think it’s a 

point of emphasis,” 
said 
offensive 

coordinator 
Tim 

Drevno. 
“The 

coaching staff does 
a good job — Jedd 
(Fisch) and Tyrone 
(Wheatley) 
and 

Jay 
(Harbaugh) 

and Jim — just making sure you’re 
preaching about it, you coach it, and 
you show examples of not allowing 
that to happen.”

Drevno was on Harbaugh’s 

staff in San Francisco in 2012, so 
he knows a little about what to 

expect from the opposing sideline. 
He pointed out that Smith’s teams 
always seemed to be in the top 
10 in forcing turnovers, and that 
they have always had solid, well-
coached defensive fronts with the 
ability to take away the run.

Certain teams have been able 

to take away parts of Michigan’s 
game 
— 
Central 
Florida 

neutralized the run by stacking 
the 
box, 
while 
Wisconsin’s 

talented 
secondary 
held 
off 

redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight until he finally 
came through with a fourth-
quarter touchdown pass. But 
no team has figured out how to 
completely stop the Wolverines’ 
offense.

If Illinois wants to defy the odds 

and be that team, it will have to 
hope that its experienced coaches 
have a few tricks up their sleeves.

“Lovie’s an outstanding coach 

and 
(defensive 
coordinator) 

Hardy Nickerson’s an outstanding 
coach,” Drevno said. “They know 
how to stack the box, they know 
how to take people out of the box. 
They’re experts at what they do. 
It’s going to be fun. It’s going to 
be a fun game, and we love games 
like this.”

Before he made the videos that 

came to define game day in Ann 
Arbor, Pat Stansik wasn’t really sure 
what he was doing.

In time, he would become known 

for showcasing the most comical 
revelry Ann Arbor had to offer. And 
as his videos spread, so did his cult 
following.

But before all that, he was a 

transfer student. He lived at home 
with his parents, looking to find his 
way after his varsity lacrosse career 
had come to a close. In its place, he 
built his life around videos.

If you haven’t yet seen an episode 

of “Pre-Gaming with Pat,” here’s 
the gist: For two seasons, Stansik 
walked around Ann Arbor on football 
Saturdays interviewing tailgaters. 

Most, if not all, of them were drunk. 
Stansik was stone-cold sober.

Add in music that was ahead of 

its time, and the result was a series 
that students could count on to 
accentuate their game day. Now, the 
videos are a time capsule — a way 
for those same students to look back 
on memories they had forgotten, 
or perhaps couldn’t remember to 
begin with.

Looking at all he accomplished 

during his time in Ann Arbor, it’s 
easy to see why, three years after 
he moved to Los Angeles, Stansik 
invokes a quote from Andy Bernard, 
a character on “The Office.”

“I wish there was a way to know 

you’re in the good old days,” Bernard 
says, “before you’ve actually left 
them.”

* * *

Even though “Pre-Gaming with 

Pat” was born in Ann Arbor, its story 
traces back to Bucknell University in 
Lewisburg, Pa.

There, 
Stansik 
had 
been 
a 

college lacrosse player in need of 
a change. He was discovering he 
wanted to major in film, and with 
that realization came another — he 
needed to go home.

He was born in Barrington, Ill., 

but Stansik grew up in Ann Arbor. 
So when he decided to transfer to 
Michigan to study film, he was going 
back to familiar territory.

When Stansik arrived, one of his 

earliest video projects was called 
“Pre-Gaming with Pat: Mustaches 
for Michigan.” It was meant more as 
a one-off endeavor.

Soon, 
though, 
Stansik 
began 

making a video blog with his 
teammates on the men’s club lacrosse 

team. Looking back, it’s easy to tell by 
the familiar cuts from silly interviews 
to action footage that these are 
the origins of the 
eventual 
tailgate 

series. 
But 
when 

Stansik graduated in 
2011, that possibility 
wasn’t really on his 
radar.

Instead, he moved 

to 
Boulder, 
Col., 

where he worked for 
the summer at an 
advertising 
agency. 

When 
that 
was 

finished, Stansik decided to come 
back to Ann Arbor, and then the 
modern pregame videos were born.

Armed 
with 
a 
significantly 

upgraded set of camera equipment, 
Stansik took to the streets of Ann 
Arbor for a much more professional 

version of the show. Naturally, 
he entrusted his new Panasonic 
camera — a graduation present — 

to his gym buddy, 
Aaron Peterson, who 
was by no means a 
trained cameraman.

“At 
the 
start 

I would just tell 
Aaron, 
just 
make 

sure the red button 
is 
on 
and 
it’s 

recording,” Stansik 
said.

As the program’s 

reputation 
grew, 

Stansik made his mark. People 
would refer to him as “Pre-Gaming 
with Pat” as if it were his name, and 
when he arrived at their parties, they 
wanted to be interviewed by him.

Many of the show’s iconic moments 

were random and authentic. But 
some of the most memorable involved 
recurring stars who took on more 
regular roles.

The most famous was Lucas Brody, 

whose character Da’Quan ended up 
spawning his own series of YouTube 
videos. Zach Schwinder was “handles 
guy,” a character who always had two 
half-gallon bottles of vodka in his 
hands. Peyton Morris proclaimed her 
talent for pre-gaming.

These 
cameos 
added 
some 

consistent sources of humor, and 
for the guests, even occasionally led 
to some recognition. Morris was 
asked if she could teach people to 
pregame, and Schwinder recalls 
admirers wanting to buy a drink for 
the “handles guy.”

Even while they now have very 

real adult lives, those reached for 
this story were far from embarrassed 
about their roles on the show.

“There’s one scene where he’s 

interviewing me, and then he cuts 
to someone else, and then he’s going 
through a music montage, then you 
see me with my back turned towards 
the crowd, with two handles up, just 
going at it,” Schwinder said. “I look 
back at that, and I’m like, yes, maybe 
that doesn’t give the best perception 
of myself. But at the same time, I 
wouldn’t trade that for the world. If 
I run for president one day, and they 
bring that up, I will only be proud of 
that moment.”

It’s a funny sentiment, but there’s 

plenty of truth to it. In creating the 
videos, Stansik set out to portray a 
largely undocumented part of the

Michigan experience. Most everyone 
knows about the football games, but 
for students, what comes before is 
nearly as important.

“It’s not all of what college was 

about, not all of what the University 
of Michigan is about, obviously, 
because there’s a lot more to it,” 
Schwinder said. “But it does bring 
me back.”

Now, the videos serve as a sort 

of time capsule for everyone at 
Michigan in 2011 
and 
2012. 
And 

for 
Morris, 
the 

importance 
of 

that 
capsule 
is 

even greater than 
nostalgia.

A 
friend 
of 

hers 
had 
been 

in many of the 
videos, 
but 
she 

has since passed 
away, leaving “Pre-
Gaming with Pat” as a window back 
to her life.

“That’s kind of the only real way 

that we can see her in the flesh still,” 
Morris said.

Perhaps 
the 
most 
surprising 

sign of the mark the show made on 
campus came from the University 
itself, possibly the only institution on 
campus that might have had a gripe 
with the videos. As Stansik’s time 
wound to a close, the University’s 
official Twitter account (@umich) 
sent its respect.

“Farewell 
#PregamingWithPat,” 

the tweet read. “We can’t condone 
you, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t 

secretly enjoy your videos. Deuces.”

* * *

There is a certain charm to the 

“Pre-Gaming 
with 
Pat” 
videos 

that makes it easy to forget that, to 
Stansik, the series was more than a 
celebration of inebriation. While his 
career goals revolve around comedy 
writing, those videos gave him an 
outlet he could throw himself into.

The 
nights 

before 
game 

days, Stansik and 
Peterson 
would 

often 
sleep 
at 

Stansik’s parents’ 
house, an unusual 
thing 
for 
two 

20-something men 
to do. For noon 
games, 
the 
goal 

was to be out and 
filming at 8 a.m.

He was so dedicated that he would 

often edit the video while watching 
the game to get it posted as soon as 
possible. It wasn’t the classic college 
game day experience, but he made 
them anyway. They made him happy.

“Especially once my athletic career 

was over, I was devastated because I 
was just like, ‘I don’t know how I’m 
going to fill this void,’ ” Stansik said. 
“Obviously I knew it was going to 
end eventually, and as it turns out, 
I mean, doing (video) is arguably 
better. It sounds crazy, because, I can 
tell you, ‘Oh, the rush of releasing a 
video,’ (but) it sounds so corny. The 
rush of uploading a YouTube video, it 

sounds so stupid to say. But I really 
enjoy doing it. I love making stuff.”

Soon, what had started out as a 

side project was putting him on the 
map.

More recognition came when his 

popular YouTube account shifted into 
more traditional comedy. His videos 
“I’m 24” and “Bros vs. Hipsters” both 
got over a million views. “Positive 
Decisions,” a music video with his 
friend Dan Henig, represented a 
notable uptick in production value. 
He even did videography for one of 
Hoodie Allen’s tours.

And then the videos stopped 

coming. When Stansik took a job at 
a Los Angeles talent agency, his time 
for some of his personal creative 
projects dwindled. He has since 
left that job, giving him the perhaps 
necessary space to again focus on the 
short-form comedy videos he enjoys 
so much. He has worked on longer 
projects, too, though the hurdles 
to 
production 
on 
bigger-budget 

creations are notably larger.

In other words, Stansik has been 

experiencing what most creatives 
do when faced with the realities of 
making it in Los Angeles.

“It’s been difficult in terms of the 

time off, because I had no plans of 
stopping, I had no plans of taking a 
job that was going to make it really 
difficult to film stuff and write stuff,” 
Stansik said. “…This time that I’ve 
been off, I guess I just want people to 
know it wasn’t by choice.”

* * *

By the end of the year, Stansik, 

now 28, plans to be in pre-production 
for his next videos. It’s a return that 
has been a long time coming, and 
Stansik seems more aware of that 
than anyone.

But while Stansik seems to feel a 

certain degree of dismay over the fact 
he hasn’t posted in years, others are 
just excited to see more of his work.

“I think … the self-deprecating 

nature of Pat’s humor kind of 
manifests 
itself 
in 
real-world 

consequences,” said Stansik’s friend 
Devin Rossinsky. “I think he maybe 
is a little too hard on himself, and 
puts some undue pressure, because 
he had this past success with ‘Pre-
Gaming with Pat,’ that he wants to 
deliver good content, and he already 
has built up a subscriber base and 
wants to do right by them and also 
wants to do right by himself.”

But if all goes according to plan, the 

uploads portion of Stansik’s YouTube 
page won’t be dormant much longer.

“I think that he’s excited and has 

a newfound spark to really get back 
into the production of sketch videos 
and musical parodies and the like,” 
Rossinsky said. “Because it’s what he 
loves to do, and I think enough time 
has passed.

“It’s about damn time.”

Breakdown: Michigan a favorite again

The Michigan football team is 

through the front half of the season 
with an unblemished 6-0 record. 
And only now are the third-ranked 
Wolverines getting fully healthy.

They are coming off a bye 

week and, before that, a 78-0 road 
thrashing of Rutgers in which the 
starters played only the first half. 
Other than season-ending injuries 
to fifth-year senior cornerback 
Jeremy 
Clark 
and 
sophomore 

offensive tackle Grant Newsome, 
Michigan’s players say they have 
regained their legs after a week off.

Their next opponent, Illinois, 

will be playing its second straight 
road game, this time in front of 
more than twice as many fans 
as last week at Rutgers. The rest 
should be just one of the many 
advantages the Wolverines have 
against the Fighting Illini (1-2 Big 
Ten, 2-4 overall) this weekend on 
homecoming. Here’s a breakdown:

Who will Michigan’s running 

back of choice be this week? 
The Wolverines continue their 
revolving door at the position, 
cycling between senior De’Veon 
Smith, redshirt junior Ty Isaac, 
freshman 
Chris 
Evans 
and 

sophomore Karan Higdon.

Three of those four have reached 

the 100-yard mark in a game this 
season — and Isaac fell a yard short 
against Rutgers — but only once has 
one of them carried more than 13 
times in a game. It’s possible a fifth 
back could even enter the fold this 
weekend if fifth-year senior Drake 
Johnson makes his 2016 debut, 
though his first action of the season 
wouldn’t be too strenuous.

The division of carries going 

forward seems to be based on a 
combination of the week of practice, 
the hot hand and the feel for the 
game. Most of those decisions have 
paid off this season, as Michigan 
amassed 481 yards on the ground 
against 
Rutgers, 
vaulting 
the 

offense into 15th place in the 
country in rushing yards per game.

That number is a bit skewed 

because of the last performance, 
but the Wolverines still hold 
an advantage over Illinois. The 
Fighting Illini rank 86th against 
the run and have surrendered an 
average of 224.2 yards in their 
five games against Football Bowl 

Subdivision opponents this year.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan pass offense vs. Illinois 
pass defense

Between blowouts in the first and 

most recent games of the season, 
redshirt sophomore Wilton Speight 
settled into a groove during a four-
game stretch. He hovered around 
the 60-percent completion mark 
and limited his interceptions. He 
hasn’t been tested much yet — and 
that shouldn’t change this weekend.

In the Rutgers game, Speight 

threw just 13 passes, one for a 
touchdown, and then he had last 
week off. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh has expressed concern 
about how his team performs in 
the weeks before and after the bye, 
but Michigan’s opponents have not 
often interrupted Speight’s rhythm 
this year.

If the Fighting Illini can do 

that, though, that might be their 
best chance to win. Smith’s teams 
have always placed an emphasis 
on forcing turnovers — that knack 
once carried the Chicago Bears 
to the Super Bowl — and Illinois 
has started on that trend. Darius 
Mosely has two of the Illini’s six 
interceptions and has returned one 
for a 78-yard touchdown.

A big play like that early 

would help Illinois garner some 
momentum at Michigan Stadium, 
so it will be Speight’s job to avoid 
giving that opportunity.

Edge: Michigan

Illinois 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Illinois’ carousel of running 

backs looks similar to Michigan’s, 
though the output has not been as 
fruitful. Kendrick Foster leads the 
Fighting Illini with 384 rushing 
yards in six games and scored both a 
rushing and a receiving touchdown 
in a win at Rutgers last week. Reggie 
Corbin is Illinois’ best big-play 
threat, with 35 carries at 9.3 yards 
apiece this year. Ke’Shawn Vaughn 
adds depth off the bench with 221 
yards. All three are gaining at least 
five yards per carry.

And then there is the quarterback 

position. First-string signal caller 
Wes Lunt won’t scramble, but Lunt 
is still questionable to play with 
an injury. If the Fighting Illini 
turn to their other option, redshirt 
sophomore Chayce Crouch, they’ll 

have a dual threat in the game. 
Crouch ranks fourth on the team 
with 176 yards and should see at least 
spot duty as a change of pace, even if 
Lunt is healthy enough to start.

All four of Illinois’ main rushers, 

though, are in for a tough matchup 
against Michigan’s defensive front. 
The Wolverines have 60 tackles 
for loss this year, 23 by their three 
starting linebackers and a team-
high 10 by redshirt sophomore 
Jabrill Peppers.

Other than a 275-yard anomaly 

against Central Florida, Michigan 
has not given up more than 81 
rushing yards in any game this 
season. That effort has been a 
central component to the defense’s 
success — when the Wolverines 
stop the run on first and second 
down, they put their opponent 
in uncomfortable situations on 
3rd-and-long. 
Michigan’s 
top-

ranked third-down defense again 
faces a good matchup with Illinois’ 
120th-ranked third-down offense.

Edge: Michigan

Illinois pass offense vs. Michigan 
pass defense

This matchup depends largely 

on the starter under center for the 
Fighting Illini. Lunt, a transfer from 
Oklahoma State, is an experienced 
quarterback with almost 1,000 
career pass attempts to his name 
between 
Oklahoma 
State 
and 

Illinois. He has completed 60 
percent of his passes this season 
with six touchdowns and just one 

interception.

Crouch, meanwhile, is more 

of a variable. He’s more of a 
run-first quarterback, and any 
one-dimensional 
offense 
going 

against Michigan’s defense is a 
risky proposition. He’s also a first-
year starting quarterback, which 
typically doesn’t fare well against 
the Wolverines’ front.

The bigger defensive threat, 

though, is the pass rush. Fresh off 
a bye week, the Wolverines will 
again fire their full arsenal — fifth-
year senior Chris Wormley, senior 
Taco Charlton and company. If they 
get to Crouch, they could rattle the 
young quarterback early. If they get 
to an ailing Lunt, they could force 
him out of the game, too.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Like almost every team in 

the country, Illinois just doesn’t 
have a proven big-play threat to 
counter Peppers. Mosely’s 11 punt 
returns have totaled just 60 yards, 
and Foster’s 14 kick returns have 
averaged 22.5. Without a threat 
to flip the field, the Fighting Illini 
might be at a disadvantage in field 
position. On the other side of the 
ball, they’ll have to decide whether 
to kick at Peppers or out of bounds 
away from him, and neither is an 
ideal option.

Illinois does have the statistical 

advantage in field-goal kicking. 
Chase McLaughlin has converted 
a solid nine of 12 attempts, while 

Michigan still has an issue at that 
position. The Wolverines’ last field 
goal came Sept. 17 against Colorado, 
and while he’s 0-for-2 in the past 
four weeks, fifth-year senior Kenny 
Allen is still the safe bet to kick if 
there’s an opportunity Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

The effect of the bye week on 

Michigan remains to be seen. The 
Wolverines’ starters have played 
30 minutes of football in the past 
two weeks, so they may have some 
rust to shake off early Saturday. It 
doesn’t hurt that they will be back 
in front of their home crowd on 
homecoming.

Illinois, 
meanwhile, 
hasn’t 

played in front of this Michigan 
Stadium crowd since 2012, when 
the Wolverines won, 45-0. The 
Fighting Illini’s last trip to a 
comparable site was a 55-14 loss to 
Ohio State in 2014.

Last time Michigan played at 

the Big House, the Wolverines 
polished off a 14-7 win against a 
good Wisconsin team to add more 
legitimacy to their College Football 
Playoff campaign. As they return 
to their home field, they now rank 
No. 3, their highest spot since 2006. 
Illinois is coming off its first Big Ten 
win of the season at Rutgers, but 
Michigan just has more to play for.

Edge: Michigan

Behind Enemy Lines: Lovie Smith

As one of the rare football 

coaches who has had success at 
both the college and professional 
level, 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh finds himself at the 
center of two worlds. Everything 
he does at Michigan seems to 
cause a media circus, but at the 
same time, pundits continue to 
speculate that he might eventually 
return to the NFL in search of a 
Super Bowl ring.

With all the attention Harbaugh 

has gotten, it’s easy to forget that 
he’s not the only coach in the Big 
Ten who has willingly left the 
NFL behind to take a job at the 
college level.

Illinois 
coach 
Lovie 
Smith 

hadn’t coached a college team in 
over 20 years, since he was the 
defensive backs coach at Ohio 
State during the 1995 season. The 
12-year NFL head coach who 
led the Chicago Bears to Super 
Bowl XLI and the 2010 NFC 
Championship game turned a lot 
of heads when he accepted the 
Fighting Illini’s head coaching job 
in March. Just two months earlier, 
he had been fired by the Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers despite coaching 
just two seasons there and the 
team appearing to be on the rise.

While the hire excited many 

Illinois fans, a turnaround won’t 
be easy — the Fighting Illini are 
just 2-4 so far this season, and they 
haven’t had a winning regular 
season since 2007. Still, there is 
hope in Champaign that a coach 
with Smith’s experience might be 
exactly what the program needs.

The Daily caught up with Smith 

in July at Big Ten 
Media 
Days 
in 

Chicago, 
where 

he 
addressed 

reporters 
about 

returning to his 
old home state and 
readjusting to the 
college level.

Question: You 

spent many years 
here in Chicago 
and had a lot of 
success with the 
Bears. What’s it like to be back in 
Chicago?

Lovie Smith: We, of course, 

feel like we’re coming home. My 

wife is from Chicago. We have two 
sons that live here. When you’re 
placed in the coaching profession 
— and I see (Iowa coach) Kirk 
Ferentz over there, Kirk’s been 
18 years at one place, that doesn’t 

happen 
most 

times. For an NFL 
team, to be there 
nine years, that’s 
quite a bit. When 
you’re in a great 
city like Chicago 
nine 
years, 
you 

love 
everything 

about it, and that’s 
how we feel. We 
kept a place here, 
we kept a home 
here throughout. 

So that transition has gone fairly 
well.

Q: When you take the step 

from the NFL back to the college 

ranks — you talked about teaching 
the 
fundamentals 
still 
being 

important to you — do you have 
to step back a little bit from a 
complexity 
standpoint 
when 

you’re coaching younger players?

LS: I feel like, even in the NFL, 

we were running a college-type 
program anyway. We put a big 
emphasis on fundamentals there. 
Defensively, we don’t have a 
complex system. I don’t think you 
play good defense based on trying 
to, you know, ‘I’m smarter than the 
guy across every play, and I have 
to call the perfect defense every 
time.’ We relied on athletic ability, 
putting guys in position to make 
plays. So I don’t feel like we’ve had 
to compromise what we did at that 
next level for what we’re gonna do 
right now. That doesn’t change an 
awful lot.

And the good coaches I’ve been 

around, as I left Ohio State and 
went to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
way back in the day, that’s what 
I got from Tony Dungy. He said, 
‘Lovie, there’s not a big difference 
between college and NFL. We’re 
gonna start our 
practices, 
early 

on we’re gonna 
teach 
tackling, 

teach 
stance, 

alignments and 
all those things, 
just 
like 
you 

did.’ So I don’t 
see it being a big 
adjustment at all.

Q: How much 

has the style of 
practice changed 
between when you first started 
coaching in college and today?

LS: There was a lot more 

contact back then, I would say. 

Now you kind of realize that you 
can’t have as much, and you have 
some marquee players that — you 
just can’t put them at risk. I just 
don’t think you have to go out 
and scrimmage every day. I think 

you can get in 
position and not 
have to throw 
your 
running 

backs 
down 

on the ground. 
I 
don’t 
think 

you have to, in 
practice, tackle 
a quarterback to 
know how to do 
it. That’s what 
drills 
are 
for. 

I’m a boxing fan 

— they’re not going in and going 15 
rounds every day. You spar, a lot. 
And that’s what you have to do to 
win our game.

What to Watch For: Kicking game, 
Peppers, Bushell-Beatty, Johnson

Two weeks ago at Rutgers, the 

Michigan football team laid it on 
fast. By halftime, the Wolverines 
were up 43-0, and most fans 
probably changed the channel 
before the game was over.

Saturday, No. 3 Michigan will 

play another low-ranked Big Ten 
opponent, but this time it will 
be at Michigan Stadium. The 
Fighting Illini (1-2 Big Ten, 2-4 
overall) will look to extend their 
win streak to two after coming 
off a 24-7 win over the Scarlet 
Knights.

Here are some reasons to stay 

tuned into this game, even if 
things get out of hand like they did 
two weeks ago:

1. Will Allen or Nordin be 

kicking field goals?

Fifth-year 
senior 
Kenny 

Allen missed two field goals 
against Wisconsin, and he hasn’t 
attempted another one since. 
Sophomore walk-on Ryan Tice 
was given a chance later in that 
game, but he missed his lone 
attempt, creating panic among the 
Michigan fan base.

At the time, freshman Quinn 

Nordin wasn’t even dressed on 
the sideline, but he was dressed 
and warming up at Rutgers 
the 
following 
week. 
In 
the 

Wolverines’ 78-0 blowout of the 
Scarlet Knights, they did not 
attempt any field goals. But after 
the game, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said Allen would have 
been given the opportunity if 
the field-goal unit was needed. 
Perhaps Saturday, especially if the 
Wolverines are comfortably ahead 
again, would be a good time to 
give Allen a chance.

The 
competition 
is 
raging 

on this week in practice, and 
Wednesday, 
linebackers 
and 

special 
teams 
coach 
Chris 

Partridge restated the difficulty of 
handling all three kicking duties 
at once. He complimented both 
Allen and Nordin, but wouldn’t 
name a starter.

2. Will Jabrill Peppers throw 

for a touchdown?

Tuesday, redshirt sophomore 

Jabrill Peppers told reporters 
that he can throw the ball 65 
yards on a good day. He’s listed 
as a linebacker, but he plays three 
ways and can apparently do even 
more than what he’s shown six 
games into the season.

Against 
Rutgers, 
he 
lined 

up at wildcat quarterback and 
cut through defenders for two 
touchdowns. After the game, it 
was revealed that he was supposed 
to throw the ball on two of the 
plays, but instead saw open space 
and ran it in.

He hasn’t disclosed whether 

the Wolverines will try it again 
this season, but most football fans 

wouldn’t mind seeing Peppers do 
even more on offense.

3. Does Bushell-Beatty look 

more comfortable?

Wednesday, 
offensive 

coordinator 
Tim 
Drevno 
got 

choked 
up 
as 
he 
discussed 

sophomore 
Grant 
Newsome’s 

horrific, 
season-ending 
knee 

injury. Losing Newsome left a 
big hole to fill at left tackle, and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Juwann 

Bushell-Beatty 
was 
the 
next 

player up.

Bushell-Beatty notched his first 

career start at Rutgers, but was hit 
hard on the second play of the game. 
He was slow to get up and needed 
to be helped off the field, but came 
back into the game a few plays later. 

Junior Mason Cole moved over to 
left tackle in his place, but Drevno 
said Wednesday that Cole is still 
considered a center.

Drevno 
stated 
that 
he’s 

comfortable with keeping Bushell-
Beatty at left tackle, and all 
Bushell-Beatty needs to do to keep 
his spot is continue to improve at 
the position as he has been doing.

4. Will veteran running back 

Drake Johnson get a chance to 
play?

Not 
that 
Michigan 
needed 

another running back to add to 
its four-man rotation of Karan 
Higdon, Chris Evans, De’Veon 
Smith and Ty Isaac, but fifth-year 
senior Drake Johnson may finally 
be healthy enough to play this 

week.

Last spring, Johnson was run 

over by a forklift while working 
out. The extent of his injury was 
never revealed, but he hasn’t yet 
seen game action this season. 
Harbaugh said on this week’s Big 
Ten coaches teleconference that 
Johnson has been “chomping at 
the bit” and that he may finally be 
ready to go against Illinois.

Last season, Johnson recorded 

six touchdowns — two of which 
were receiving — while averaging 
five yards per attempt. Despite 
his impact last season, he’ll have 
to compete with the others for 
carries now that he’s healthy. 
True freshman Evans leads the 
pack with 400 rushing yards, but 
Smith, Isaac and Higdon all have 
over 250 as well.
