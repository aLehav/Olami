Board likely to vote
in opposition to
state Senate bill
By RAZYA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
In a surprise announcement
late last night, the University's
Board of Regents announced it
would hold a special phone meet-
ing today at 8 a.m.
The regents called the meet-
ing as an emergency action
under Regents' Bylaw 1.01, which
permits the group to meet in
between its monthly meetings to
discuss time-sensitive issues. The
meeting was likely called so the
board could vote on whether or
not it supports a bill introduced
last week in the state Senate
that would ban graduate student
research assistants from union-
izing, sources told The Michigan
Daily.
According to the Regents'
Bylaws, the meeting required
either the University president
or three regents to initiate any
action and aquorum of five mem-
bers of the board to affirm the
action.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said that because the
meeting is considered an emer-
gency action, it is not in violation
of the Michigan Open Meetings

Boardof Regents meeting.
Act, which requires the regents
to notify the public of a meeting
at least 18 hours before it is set to
take place.
"The way I understand it is
that that bylaw does provide for
taking action between meetings,"
Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald said he was unsure
whether or not a meeting like this
has been called in the past.
The call is open to the pub-
lic to listen in from the Fleming
Administration Building.
Stephen Raiman, founder of
Students Against GSRA Union-
ization and a Rackham student
said the meeting would have a
predictable outcome.
"I'd say it's pretty likely that
they will not support this legisla-
tion," he said.
He added that he was dis-
appointed in the fact that the
regents would probably vote to
oppose the bill.
"That would not be in the best
interest of GSRAs or the Univer-
sity," he said.
The Graduate Employees'
Organization declined to com-
ment on the basis that it did not
have enough informationto doso.

the

discuss budget,
UMHS scandal at
meeting
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
At yesterday's Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs meeting, University
Provost Philip Hanlon reported
that a record number of stu-
dents applied for admission
to the University this year. A
total of 41,600 people applied

topping the 38,700 applicants
received last year.
The University's lead faculty
governing body also discussed
state budget allocations to the
University following Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder's recently
proposed state budget plans
and drafted a proposal in sup-
port of the call by the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents for an
external investigation into the
child pornography case.
At the meeting, Hanlon said
a majority of the growth in
applications has come from
out-of-state students, adding
that this class of applicants has

grade point average and high-
est test scores ever seen.
"It is really quite impres-
sive," he said.
Last year, the number of
applicants to the University
rose 20 percent.
Hanlon told the Daily in
an interview in July that he
attributed the increase to the
University's adoption of the
Common Application, which
allows students to apply to
multiple universities with one
application.
He said the ease of using the
Common Application and the
University's reputation were

growth in applicants.
SACUA DISCUSSES
STATE BUDGET
Though Snyder's proposed
budget calls for a 3.1 percent
increase to the state's higher
education allocation - amount-
ing to $36.2 million more for
higher education than the last
fiscal year's budget - the Uni-
versity would only see a 1.4-per-
cent increase in state funding
Hanlon said. The level of state
support is consistent with the
amount of funding provided in

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
Hormone study examines intimacy levels

Researchers find
discrepancies
between genders
By TUI
GLASGOW-RADEMAKER
For the Daily
Fear of intimacy among
women now has a physiological

explanation, according to new
research from the University's
Department of Psychology.
The study, led by Robin Edel-
stein, assistant professor of
psychology, measured the hor-
monal responses of students
who were exposed to videos
with emotionally intimate con-
tent. The results found women
who avoid romantic intimacy
emitted lower levels of estradiol

- a hormone linked with bond-
ing and caregiving - when they
watched videos depicting affec-
tion. Conversely, women who
were generally more intimate
showed higher estradiol levels.
While Edelstein explained
that other studies have shown
a correlation between estradiol
and attachment, she hoped that
in her experiment she would be

Arson destroys charity's building

10 years ago this week (Feb. 20,
2002): Arson was ruled the cause
of a fire that burned down the Ann
Arbor United Way headquarters
on Feb. 19th, 2002, The Michigan
Daily reported.
Assistant Fire Chief Michael
Skyrpec said flammable mate-
rial was discovered when canines
searched the scene. United Way is
a national organization that raises
money to give resources to families
in need and provides funding for
other agencies, including the Boy
Scouts of America.
Some speculated that the arson
was started by allies of the Office of
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans-
gender Affairs in support of its ini-
tiative to stop the University from
funding United Way because the

organization provides funding to
the Boy Scouts, which has a strict
anti-homosexual policy.
50 years ago this week (Feb.
21, 1962): The state of Michigan's
constitutional convention passed
a proposal regarding higher educa-
tion in the state that required that
university governing board meet-
ings at state institutions be open to
the public and that all state univer-
sities must give an annual account
of their financial accounting to the
legislature.
The proposal also granted con-
stitutional status to all ten state
colleges and universities and
required legislative responsibil-
ity for community colleges, which
was a first for the state, according
to the Daily.

100 years ago this week (Feb.
22, 1912): Twenty feet of snow fell
over the course of the week and
wreaked havoc on the University's
events planned to honor former
President George Washington's
birthday, the Daily reported.
The inclement weather prevent-
ed Chase Osborn, then governor of
Michigan, from traveling to Ann
Arbor to give a speech in Wash-
ington's honor at the University.
All trains between Lansing and
Ann Arbor were suspended, but
two snowplows were brought in
to clear the tracks in an attempt to
bring the governor to the Universi-
ty.After working for two hours and
clearing only five miles of track,
the crew abandoned the effort

able to manipulate the levels
of the hormone released and sub-
sequently identify a cause of its
increase.
Rackham student Bill Chopik,
who worked with Edelstein on
the study, said an interesting
implication of the research was
its ability to challenge commonly
held beliefs.
"There's an assumption that
whether it be intimate movies
or action movies ... we assume
they affect people the same way,"
Chopik said. "Action movies
exhilarate us; intimacy movies
make us feel certain feelings, but
what's interesting is that's not
the entire story for everybody...
Individuals differ from each
other."
The study was conducted
using a sample of 229 male and
female undergraduate students
who responded to questions
regarding their abilities to be
intimate in romantic relation-
ships. They were then shown
one of three videos that acted as
potential stimuli for the estra-
diol - a film of ocean life, a video
depicting children dancing, or
a clip portraying a close father-
daughter relationship. The par-
ticipants' saliva was sampled
before and after the film viewing
as a way to detect the hormonal
changes.
Edelstein and her team chose
an intimate clip that portrayed a

close, but not romantic, relation-
ship with a father and daughter
as a way of eliminating the sexu-
al hormones and focusing on the
emotional ones.
"We got the research showing
that there are a lot of hormone
changes that come along with
viewing sexual kinds of images,
but not this specifically intimate
quality," Edelstein said. "We
thought that using a parent-child
interaction would separate that
sexual component and get that
out of it."
However, Edelstein predicts
that the findings would also be
relevant to romantic .relation-
ships.
While both men and women
participated in the study, there
was a dramatic difference in
the hormonal activity of each
gender. Even men who reported
to be intimate in relationships
showed virtually no change in
estradiol levels when exposed to
the videos.
While the study did not offer
an explanation for the discrep-
ancy between men and women,
Edelstein speculated that the
difference could be due to dif-
ferent estradiol sensitivity levels
between men and women.
"We're wondering also though
whether woman identified with
the video clip more," Edelstein
added, referring to the father-
daughter relationship depicted.
"So that's another thing we
might like to try is maybe (use) a
different kind of clip that would
elicit the same response for

avoidant men."
Considering the findings of
the study, Tim Davis, associate
director of Counseling and Psy-
chological Services at the Uni-
versity, said personality types
also have a large influence in
determining how an individual
approaches4 relationships. He
also stressed the role that social-
ization and life experience play
'in shaping attitudes towards
intimacy, citing the effect trau-
ma may have on one's ability to
form attachments.
"Sometimes that might just
mean a really severe emotional
letdown on the part of someone
who's close to them," Davis said.
"Sometimes it means a real viola-
tion of trust or sexual abuse that
makes it hard for people to trust
enough to be emotionally inti-
mate as adults."
However, according to
Chopnik, the early childhood
socialization approach and the
hormone responses found in the
study are by no means exclusive
of each other. He said attach-
ment theory - which examines
the impact of childhood experi-
ences on subsequent relation-
ships and interactions - was
an important consideration and
basis for the study.
He added that early socializa-
tion affects hormone responses
in later life, describing it as a bi-
directional relationship.
"Hormones influence how
we behave, and how we behave
influences hormones," Chopik
said.

Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney speaks in Mayfield Heights, Ohio on Feb.16.
Presidential campaigns and outside political groups began filing detailed financial reports yesterday.
Republican super PACs
buoyed by mega donors

Two Super PACs
spent close to $24
million in January
WASHINGTON - A pair of
"super" political action commit-
tees supporting top Republican
presidential candidates spent
nearly $24 million in January,
drawing upon major gifts and
repeat donations from wealthy
business executives, according to .
financial reports the groups filed
yesterday with the government.
The super PACs - Mitt Rom-
ney-leaning Restore Our Future
and Newt Gingrich-supportive
Winning Our Future -'raised a
combined $17 million last month.
That financial strength allowed
the groups to hit the airwaves in
key primary states with millions
of dollars in expensive TV ads.
The groups' fundraising offers
a periodic behind-the-scenes
glimpse into the identities of the
wealthy supporters who will help
elect the next president, along
with details on how the tens of
millions of dollars they donated
have been spent this election sea-

son. Restore Our Future, which
spent $14 million last month, has
been boosted by more than two
dozen repeat donors. Winning
Our Future, which spent $9.7
million, is largely supported by
casino mogul Sheldon Adelson
and his wife.
The super PACs, as well as
other groups supporting other
candidates and the individual
campaigns, were required to dis-
close how much they raised and
the identities of their donors in
reports filed with the Federal
Election Commission by mid-
night yesterday.
Those reports provided a
snapshot of fundraising for
President Barack Obama's early
campaign and for Republican
candidates as they battled dur-
ing important primary elections
in January. During the month,
GOP candidates Newt Gingrich
and Rick Santorum had briefly
surged ahead of front-runner
Mitt Romney but trailed the for-
mer Massachusetts governor in
fundraising. Since then, Santo-
rum has climbed remarkably in
polls as support eroded just as
stunningly for Gingrich follow-

ing his disappointing showing in
Florida.
Restore Our Future has been a
boon for Romney, who has bene-
fited greatly from the group's TV
ads attacking Gingrich in par-
ticular. Such ads were purchased
thanks to the financial help of
repeat donors, including Marri-
ott International Chairman J.W.
Marriott Jr., who has given the
super PAC $750,000 to date.
The super PAC also reported
new donors, including Hewlett-
Packard CEO Meg Whitman.
Romney mentored Whitman,
recently an unsuccessful can-
didate for California governor,
during the 1980s at Boston-based
Bain & Co., the private equity
firm Romney headed. Whit-
man's $100,000 check to Restore
Our Future came days after she
joined Romney at a celebration
of his victory in the New Hamp-
shire primary.
Restore Our Future counted
on continued support from at
least 30 repeat donors who have
given a combined $6.6 million in
January, according to a review
of the reports by The Associated
Press.

Vigneron described the wide-

TEHRAN
Iran may extend oil
embargo beyond
France, Britain
Tehran is considering extend-
ing an oil embargo on France and
Britain to other European coun-
tries, a semiofficial Iranian news
agency reported yesterday.
The head of Iran's state oil
company Ahmad Qalehbani was
quoted by Mehr as saying that
the country would stop selling
crude to nations who take action
against Tehran.
"If the hostile acts of some
other European countries con-
tinue, oil exports to these coun-
tries will be cut," he said.
Iran announced the cut-offs
to France and Britain on Sunday,
a pre-emptive retaliation for an
EU embargo over Tehran's con-
troversial nuclear program that
is scheduled to go into effect in
July.
Since the embargo was
announced last month, Iranian
officials have said that Tehran
should enact its own sanctions
immediately, before European
countries lined up alternative
suppliers.
The news sent oil prices to a

nine-month high, reaching $105
per barrel in Asia on Monday.
PARIS
Former IMF chief
questioned about
prostitution ring
Former IMF chief Dominique
Strauss-Kahn will be questioned
today by French police investi-
gating a suspected hotel prosti-
tution ring.
Police in the northern French
city of Lille are probing a sus-
pected prostitution ring in
France and neighboring Belgium
that has implicated police and
other officials.
Police have questioned prosti-
tutes who said they had sex with
Strauss-Kahn during 2010 and
2011 at a luxury hotel in Paris,
a restaurant in the French capi-
tal and also in Washington DC.
Strauss-Kahn lived in the U.S.
capital while he was head of the
International Monetary Fund
before resigning his IMF posi-
tion in May.
Two men with ties to Strauss-
Kahn have been put under pre-
liminary investigation in France
on charges including organizing
a prostitution ring and misuse of

1964, when the University had
half the number of students it
currently has, he said.
Hanlon said he was glad the
University had a voice in the state
budgetary allocation process.
"We did have input, and Sm
grateful for that," he said.
Hanlon added that he is proud
of the efforts made by the Uni-
versity over the last several years
to cut costs as state and federal
allocations have continually
decreased amid the challenging
economic climate in the state.
"(All of this) has been achieved
by the hard work and sacrifice of
those all over the University," he
said.
Despite the increase in state
funding, Hanlon said the Uni-
versity would continue its efforts
to curb costs, but cautioned that
some costs were uncontrollable
and more sacrifices would be

made.
"We have done our best to
protect academic enterprise ...
(but) the low hanging fruit are
gone at this point," Hanlon said.
Specifically, the University is
trying to cut costs by being more
efficient with efforts such as
funding cuts for low-performing
departments and fewer classes
in fields that are not as popu-
lar, Hanlon said. However, he
emphasized that the University
would keep a focus on maintain-
ing a high quality of education,
despite the budget cuts.
He added that an increase in
tuition was inevitable, despite
the University's ongoing
attempts to prevent further costs
to students.

SUPPORTING EXTERNAL
INVESTIGATION
SACUA members also drafted
a resolution in support of the

University's Board of Regents,
following the recent vote by the
regents for an external inves-

Michigan Health System for
delaying to report that former
medical resident Stephen Jen-
son was allegedly in possession
of child pornography.
"(SACUA) supports all fact-
finding external investigations
that seek to identify factors that
led to the incident, its initial
investigation, as well as the delay
in reporting," the statement read.
Last Tuesday, an affidavit
was filed by the U.S. Secret Ser-
vice in regard to Jenson, report-
ing that 97 photos and four
videos were found on a flash
drive reportedly owned by Jen-
son that depict suspected child
pornography.

the 2008 auto industry bail-
outs and with one week until
Republican voters head to the
polls, he is still in second.
Michigan, which has 30 del-
egates to the GOP convention,
is regarded by many observers
to be a fulcrum in a Republican
nomination race that began with
a close contest between the two
candidates in the Iowa caucuses
last month.
Vincent Hutchings, an assis-
tant professor of political sci-
ence, said if Romney loses
Michigan, it could compromise
'his national support and boost
Santorum asa viable Republican
alternative.
Last week, Romney's chances
for winning the state got a boost
when Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der formally endorsed him at a
campaign event in Farmington
Hills, Mich.
LSA senior Brian Koziara,
external vice chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Republi-
cans, said that similar to Snyder,
the organization supports Rom-
ney for his vast understanding
of the state's economy and the
automobile industry, particular-
ly since Romney's father, George
Romney, was formerly president
of American Motors.
"There's a lot of people who
say, 'Oh, (Romney's) not really a
Michigander. He was only born
here and spent his childhood
here,"' Koziara said. "I think
that he can identify with the
auto industry, and he can iden-
tify with so many people here in
the state."
Much of the support from the
College Republicans stems from
the belief that Romney would
ultimately be more likely to
defeat President Barack Obama
in November than Santorum,
Koziara said.
He added that a majority of
the organization's familiar-
ity with Romney stems from the
members' southeast Michigan
roots, a region where the Rom-
ney family has been especially
visible and popular because of
their grasp on the auto industry.
"The people of Michigan
know Mitt Romney better,"
Koziara said. "He's the native
son, if you will, and I think a lot
of people will be relying on that.
At the end of the day, Romney is
a known quantity here."
Still, Hutchings said it's
"easy to overstate" the advan-

tage Romney's upbringing in
the state might offer him in the
polls. He added that Michigan
voters will still fill out their bal-
lots based on the issues, and the
perception that Romney is not a
true conservative will harm him
more than the home state advan-
tage will help him.
"He's got name recognition,
so people know him and they
know in many instances that
he's from the state," he said.
"But unfortunately, what people
know about him, or at least what
they think they know, they don't
like."
Last week, Romney authored
an editorial in The Detroit News
defending his preference for
managed bankruptcy in the bail-
out and slamming Obama's poli-
cies in aiding the auto industry.
The piece earned considerable
backlash from Democratic law-
makers statewide and in Con-
gress, but Hutchings said it is
unlikely that.the position will
hurt Romney much in the pri-
mary.
"People who are likely to vote
against Romney aren't necessar-
ily doing so because of his stance
on the bailout," Hutchings said.
"They're doing it because of the
perception that he's not a true
conservative."
The latest Public Policy Poll-
ing survey of Michigan Republi-
cans found that Romney is still
trailing Santorum by 4 percent,
with 37 percent of respondents
supporting Santorum and 33
percent supporting Romney.
That deficit is down from the
15-percent gap seen in last
week's Public Policy Polling sur-
vey.
In a conference call with
reporters yesterday, Tom Jen-
sen, director of Public Policy
Polling, said Romney's strategy
in Michigan has focused less on
attacking the competition than
he has in other states.
"(Romney has) really
increased his own positive
image with the voters in Michi-
gan," Jensen said. "That's dif-
ferent than what he did in
Florida, where he really gained a
lot of momentum by just totally
attacking the heck out of Newt
Gingrich."
In 2008, Romney defeated
Arizona Sen. John McCain in
the Michigan Republican pri-
mary election by a vote of 39
percent to 30 percent. Romney
earned 30 percent of the stu-
dent vote, but finished second to
McCain among voters in 15 pre-
cincts near campus.
before the Senate committee,
according to Raiman.
Ulaby received attention
last month for starting a peti-
tion addressed to the regents,
opposing the unionization
efforts of the GSRAs.
In addition to today's emer-
gency meeting, GSRAs are also
gearing up for presentations
before Administrative Law
Judge Julia Stern.
Parties opposed to unioniza-
tion, such as SAGU and Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette, were
granted permission to call wit-
nesses and present evidence

In preparation for the upcom-
ing primary, the city has issued
about 2,000 absentee ballots,
City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry
said.
Beaudry said she expected
turnout for the primaries this
year to be "low to moderate,"
based on her expectation that
most Ann Arbor residents will
vote Democrat or choose not to
vote in primary elections at all.
"You just see less people
vote in the primaries," she said.
"More people are interested in
the final election. That's when
we'll see the huge turnout both
in person and in absentee ballot
requests."
In a separate conference
call yesterday, Virginia Gov.
Bob McDonnell and Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
discussed their support for
Romney. McDonnell arrived in
Michigan last night to campaign
on Romney's behalf.
Though Romney's campaign
is quickly gaining momentum,
the primary will not be easily
won, Schuette said.
"(Romney) is running a
tough, nitty-gritty campaign,
and I think Michigan likes that,"
Schuette said.
Romney has shownhe isncapa-
ble of handling financial issues,
McDonnell said. He added that
Romney's ability to balance the
budget without raising taxes
while serving as governor of
Massachusetts is an indicator of
his potential for success.
McDonnell announced his
endorsement of Romney on Jan.
20, the day before the South Car-
olina primary.
McDonnell said Romney's
experience working in the pri-
vate sector will serve as a great
advantage in dealing with
national fiscal issues, empha-
sizing the 100,000 jobs Rom-
ney created while working with
other business leaders during
his time at Bain Capital, a pri-
vate investment firm.
He also said family values are
important for Republican vot-
ers in Michigan, which Romney
effectively demonstrates.
"(Romney) is concerned about
kitchen table, bread and butter
issues, and that has overwhelm-
ingly been (his) focus," McDon-
nell said.
Schuette saidRomney's recent
surge will continue to help him
as the primary approaches.
"(Romney) is scrappy - he's
sharp on all the issues, and I like
his position. He's goingto be the
comeback kid," Schuette said.

for two or fewer terms rather than
to upperclassmen. The policy
change forced many upperclass-
men to look for alternative hous-
ing options.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan said all the rooms
were filled by mid-day on Feb. 10,
the last day of open housing sign
up. In response to the fewer avail-
able residence halls due to renova-
tions, Logan said housing options
were changed to better accommo-
date undergraduates who wanted
to live on campus.
This year, Northwood III
apartments house students par-
ticipating in the First Year Expe-
rience program and upper level
undergraduates, but next year the
First Year Experience program
will include all of the buildings
in Northwood III and house only
freshmen.
To accommodate the change,
Northwood I and II will be
available for upper-level under-
graduates next fall, with gradu-
ate student housing available in
Northwood IV and V apartments.
Student Affairs Director
Michael Zabriskie, who oversees
the housing sign up process, said
when all the housing spots were
filled, students who were not able
to signup were notified via e-mail.
"We sent an e-mail out to the
students to let them know what
was happening so that way they
weren't logging on without hav-
ing some sort of notification about
it," Zabriskie said. "We had been
keeping a close eye on the avail-
able spaces when itcgot to be a very
small number."
The e-mail provided students
with alternative housing options,
as well as offered a sign-up wait-
list for students still interested in
living on campus so they can be
notified if room openings arise,
Logan said.
Though 180 students were
unable to sign up for on-campus

housing, Logan said the housing
office hasn't received many com-
plaints.
"We have not been over-
whelmed by a large number of
concerned students or parents,
but there have been several,"
Logan said. "And we've been try-
ing to help them each on an indi-
vidual basis."
LSA freshman Jonathan
Lesnau said though he willlive off-
campus next year, he feels bad for
those who didn'treceivethe hous-
ing plans they wanted because of
the now-limited options.
"I know I'd be pretty upset,"
Lesnau said. "I think especially
for freshmen right now who are
living on North (Campus) and
really wanted to maybe get, like,
West Quad or North Quad -
that'd be pretty disappointing."
University Housing also. held
an Off-Campus Housing Fair on
Feb. 14 for students unwilling to
wait for on-campus housing. The
fair provided students with the
opportunity to meet and talk to
landlords with available proper-
ties in the area.
The University has held simi-
lar fairs in the past, but this event
wasthe firstintwoyears.Housing
officials decided to bring the fair
back due to the on-campus hous-
ingshortage.
Coleen Kendall, manager of
Fuller Apartments at 800 Fuller
St., said she talked to about 50
students about leasing rooms in
her building, but noted that was a
low number comparedto previous
University housing fairs.
"Well, normally here you
wouldn't even be able to count
(the students)," Kendall said. "But
I don't think they let people know
soon enough. It was kind of a last
minute thing."
Logan said the event wasn't
promoted heavily because it was
organized quickly.
"We probably could have puta
bit more promotion into it," Logan
said. "This one came together ...
pretty quickly. So something we
need to continue in the future is
better promotion."
Logan added it would be ben-
eficial for University Housing
to continue hosting off-campus

Trust the legal process
Civilian courts are effective in terrorist cases
mar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the convicted terrorist referred
to as the "Underwear Bomber," has been sentenced to life in a
U.S. federal prison. The 25-year-old Nigerian who attempted
to detonate explosives hidden in his undergarments on a flight from
Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 was sentenced to four
consecutive life sentences and an additional 50 years in prison by a
federal judge. The sentencing comes after Abdulmutallab pleaded
guilty in October to charges including conspiracy to commit an act of
terrorism and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.


Free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions, and
therefore less care that has to be done.

A warmer winter

and snowless sidewalks were
pleasant surprises for just
about every student on campus. I

The processing and subsequent sentencing
of Abdulmutallab adds to the ever-growing
body of evidence indicating that the Ameri-
can legal system can be, and has been, an
effective way to prosecute accused terrorists.
The U.S. shouldn't have to resort to extrale-
gal or constitutionally questionable methods
such as indefinite detentions to combat ter-
rorism. Instead, individuals caught plan-
ning or executing domestic terrorist attacks
should be granted the full due process of law
on American soil.
Abdulmutallab's is one in a series of cases
that have seen similar outcomes. Other ter-
rorist suspects tried in civilian courts include
the would-be Times Square bomber Faisal
Shahzad, "Shoe Bomber" Richard Reid, Jose
Padilla, Ali al-Marri and more than a dozen
others. As of April 2011, the conviction rate
in civilian courts for Jihadi-related crimes,
including those in which the government
dropped the charges or a judge dismissed
them, has been 87 percent, with an average
prison term of 14 years, according to The
Center on Law and Security at the New York
University School of Law. In the same time
frame, military tribunals had produced five
convictions and far more lenient sentences.
The argument that civilian courts don't
allow for effective intelligence gathering is
specious. In fact, the prosecution has more

tools at its disposal within a legal framework
to ensure that valuable information is gained
from terror suspects. For instance, prosecu-
tors may be able to offer plea deals in the form
of a shorter sentence or better living condi-
tions in exchange for intelligence that is veri-
fiably accurate.
In two major cases, Abdulmutallab and
Mansour Arbabsiar - the man accused of
plotting to assassinate the Saudi Arabian
ambassador to the U.S. in Washington, D.C.
on behalf of Iran - were read their Miranda
rights but still provided a wealth of infor-
mation about Al Qaeda and Iranian opera-
tions. Furthermore, American law permits a
"national security exception," which allows
law enforcement to withhold the reading of
Miranda rights until relevant information
is extracted from the suspect, ostensibly to
combat immediate threats to public safety.
The United States needs to combat terror-
ism with a strategy that reflects a moral back-
bone and coheres with what are often called
American values - freedom, integrity and
fairness. These values must be at the fore-
front of our discussion on national security,
not merely considered as an aside or evoked
when convenient. As cases like Abdulmutal-
lab's have shown, America does not have to
compromise human dignity or due process
for security.

sensation in my
hands. I mean, what is this? Florida?"
Aha! Al Gore's "Inconvenient
Truth" strikes again! Not quite.
To those proponents of global
warming who view this winter as
irrefutable evidence of the theory,
pump the brakes. Though a global
climate shift has certainly affected
the weather in recent months, it's not
the whole story.
The main reason behind this
year's balmy winter is related to
weather patterns in the North Pole.
The North Atlantic Oscillation is a
weather current that hasn't swooped
down into the U.S. like it normally
does. This current of arctic air typi-
cally reaches the U.S. during the win-
ter months and causes temperatures
to drop. It simply hasn't moved far
enough south to affect the weather
here, and therefore, the tempera-
ture's stayed warm.
Anyone who's been followingthe
weather trends in Europe over the
past month will have noted that the
country is experiencing one of the
worst winters in modern history.
Parts of Russia have actually record-
ed temperatures dropping to minus
63 degrees. The cold has caused the
deaths of more than 600 people in
the past weeks, msainly those without
homes. The root of Europe's record-

breakitg winterwis the diametric
opposite of the warm U.S. winter.
The Arctic Oscillation current has
turned to a negative phase, which
has forced frigid arctic air from the
North Pole into Europe.
The weather patterns in the U.S.
and Europe are naturally occurring
phenomena, and coupled with other
weather currents, they're respon-
sible for the extreme climates this
winter. Though both can be viewed
as anomalous situations, there does
seem to be a correlation with global
warming here. Some scientists think
that glacial melt has released warmer
air in the Arctic, causing a shift in the
aforementioned weather patterns
which led to the extreme climates.
Whatever the cause is, certain
parts of the country must cope with
the after-effects of the warm tem-
peratures. The obvious casualties
of such a mild winter are those who
rely on the snow to do business. Ski
resorts are struggling to tread snow
right now because the warm tem-
peratures are affecting their ability
to draw customers and even main-
tain man-made snow. In Michigan,
about $4 billion in tourism revenue
depends on the winter months to
flourish. The warm temperatures
and lack of snow have put a serious
strain on the more than 40 ski slopes
and resorts in the state and have hurt
their profits during their short time-
frame of operation.
Snow-related businesses may be
suffering right now, and come har-
vest season,.consumers will be in for
a rude awakening. The warm weath-
er has prematurely launched blos-
soming fruit trees into spring mode.
The blossoms of these trees are
temperature-sensitive and a few cold
weeks toward the end of the winter
could spell disaster for the industry.
The early bloom may even cause food
shortages across the country and

drive up prices.
C'onsum ers might be able to make
up for these increased food prices
with the money they're currently
saving onsheating bills. Natural gas
futures are currently trading at about
$2.50 per million British thermal
units and are expected to achieve a
low of at about $1.80 per share. Com-
pare this to the $15 per share seen
back in 2005, and it's clear that hives-
tors may be a little distraught by such
a stark decrease in price. But inves-
tors aside, the low trading values are
good news on two fronts: the cost of
heating a home is cheaper and less
natural gas is burned, which means
less carbon emission.
Global warming
is only part
of the story.
Perhaps the best news to come out
of this whole ordeal is the direct, pos-
itive impact that the warmer weather"'
has on students. I don't know about
you, but I sure can enjoy a winter
dusting a little bit more knowing it'll
be gone in a couple days. Last week,
I went to the Nichols Arboretum in
shorts and sneakers, for God's sake.
This winter is a reminder that the
climate of the earth is shifting and
extreme conditions, whether balmy
or frigid, are inevitable. So enjoy it
while it lasts - who's to say that our
situation won't be flip-flopped with
Europe's next winter?

Ban the box

The Michigan Daily published a viewpoint
by Caroline Syms on Jan. 31. "Do the crime,
pay the time" argued against banning the
box, or removing the box on job applications
that requires an applicant to check whether
or not they have been convicted of a crime.
The author argues that those who've already
served their sentences should continue to face
penalties after doing so. We see this as blatant
employment discrimination that perpetuates
social and economic inequality and does noth-
ing to make our communities safer. Syms mis-
represents an already marginalized group and
misstates important facts about the objectives
of the Ban the Box campaign.
The Fair Chance Coalition's Ban the Box
campaign seeks to remove inquiries into fel-
ony and misdemeanor conviction status from
public job applications. The previous article
suggested that banning the box would limit
employers' access to applicants' criminal his-
tory, but this is untrue. Banning the box won't
bar employers from asking about applicants'
conviction statuses or performing background
checks. Rather, it would allow applicants to
be judged on their qualifications before their
criminal history is taken into account. This
will allow former convicts to obtain employ-
ment and thereby mitigate what has become
a revolving door in and out of the prison sys-
tem. Michigan currently has a recidivism rate
of about 31 percent, according to Pew Center
on the States, largely due to a lack of legitimate
opportunities for ex-offenders.
Syms also overlooks the racial and class
implications of the box. Since the 1980s, the
ongoing War on Drugs and "tough on crime"

rhetoric has created a system that dispropor-
tionately targets African American and His-
panic communities. In a recent report, the
Justice Policy Institute found "while African
Americans and whites use and sell drugs at
similar rates, African Americans are ten times
more likely than whites to be imprisoned for
drug offenses." The systematic racism sur-
rounding criminal justice policies contributes
not only to a de facto caste system, but also one
that is distinctly racial.
Those who oppose the ban claim that the
box safeguards our workplaces against the
threat of ex-offenders and that these individu-
als still pose a threat to society, even after com-
pleting their prison sentences. There are major
flaws in our criminal justice system as it exists
today, but we must respond to this ineffective-
ness proactively by organizing communities
and legislation around the root causes of crime.
We must not respond reactively with further
barriers for ex-offenders as they attempt to re-
enter society by'impairing their ability to find
secure employment.We agree with Syms when
she writes, "Convicted felons should have a fair
chance to explain themselves and their history
in greater detail." However, we also believe
that banning the box is the first step in provid-
ing ex-offenders that opportunity.

As the ideological groundwork for military strikes on
Iran is laid by certain media outlets and hawks in Wash-
ington, D.C. and Tel Aviv, there are a wide array of par-
allels to be drawn between the disastrous past and the
contentious present. One underlying presumption that
constantly recurs, however, warrants special attention as
it's a key impetus for intervention - that leaders in much
of the developing world, particularly in Iran, are emo-
tional, unpredictable and, most importantly, do not cal-
culate in the same rational manner that Western leaders
do. Consequently, they can't be left to their own devices.
In the 1950s, Time magazine, one of the most influen-
tial publications in the United States at the time, did not
merely parrot the arguments uttered in the corridors of
power in Washington, D.C. to overthrow Iran's nascent
but burgeoning democracy, but seriously affected the
contours of the debate. Indeed, Time made the case for
intervention and lobbied for it by effectively, yet errone-
ously, portrayingIranian Premier Mohammad Mossadeq
as a "demagogic, emotional, child-like fanatic" who can
easily be duped by communism. The central idea was that
Iran's leaders could not be trusted to govern their own
country simply because they were too immature to be
trusted'during the Cold War to safeguard vital Western
interests - access to the resources that fueled the capi-
talist West's economic superiority, namely oil and gas.
Thus, such portrayals and logic rendered Iran an accept-
able area for the exercise of U.S. power and that the Unit-
ed States knew better than Iran how the Middle Eastern
country should be governed.
This racism was not limited to Western depictions
of Iran's leadership. During the Cold War, much of the
developing world was targeted for intervention under a
similar rubric of rationality, or lack thereof. In the case of
the Congo, for instance, Congolese independence leader
Patrice Lumumba was depicted much in-the same vein
as Iran's leadership had been cast, according to historian
Odd Arn Westad.
"While most U.S. political leaders up to the early 1960s
"had thought of Africans as children who were destined
to remain children, the Kennedy administration began
seeing Africans as adolescents, in the process of growing
up, as witnessed by the creation of new states and politi-
cal movements. The anti-Communist argument was no
longer that socialism did not fit 'the African tribal men-
tality'... but the fear that Communists might seduce ado-

lescent African leaders."
Like Iran's Mossadeq, Lumumba was judged to
be fickle and immature, and thus unfit to rule such. a
resource-rich country vital to Western Cold War strate-
gic interests. As a result, armed right-wing allies backed
by the West overthrew and summarily executed him.
Unfortunately, after decades of interaction with Iran,
this arrogant demeanor has not only persisted, but wors-
ened. More than 20 years after the end of the Cold War
and almost 60 years after the U.S.-British overthrow of
Iran's "child-like fanatic" Mossadeq, Iran continues to
be portrayed as emotional, irrational and, worse yet,
is also presumed to be "suicidal" because of its Islamic
culture. Expatriate Iranians are equally guilty of such
depictions. Last year, a journalist of Iranian descent at
The Los Angeles Times referred to Iran, a country of
more than 75 million, as "steeped in a culture of Shiite
Muslim martyrdom."
Such labels erroneously cast Iran and its leadership as
unpredictable irrational, and, consequently, unfit to be
,trusted with affairs such as developing its own nuclear
energy - a legal right to all signatories of the Nucle-
ar Non-Proliferation Treaty that Iran joined in 1968.
Should "child-like" Iran be "allowed" to continue to
develop nuclear technology, the anachronistic argument
goes, the world would be threatened with the possibil-
ity of a nuclear-armed Iran that would not be governed
with the Mutual Assured Destruction doctrine that
kept the "peace" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union
during the Cold War. Iran would not abide by the doc-
trine because it is seemingly "suicidal" and "steeped in
a culture of Shiite Muslim martyrdom," and could use
a nuclear device on its adversaries even if it guaranteed
its own destruction. Thus, Iran, scrutinized under such
racist and grossly inaccurate categorizations, warrants
intervention in 2012, as it did in 1953.
Until the media and Western leaders break with such
depictions that justified, indeed demanded, ruinous
intervention in the developing world in general, and Iran
in 1953 in particular, the contours of the debate will con-
tinue to be guided in a direction that will make future
military conflict unavoidable, and possibly even more
disastrous than in the past.

There is only one type of occa-
sion where it's acceptable for
thousands of hot, sweaty sub-
stance abusers to pack in together
like sundried sardines: summer
music festivals. And for us con-
certgoers - the CamelBak-toting,
beach-ball-throwing, caution-to-
the-wind-dancing subculture of
music aficionados - the warm
months are our regular season,
like football in autumn and crick-
et in ... whenever that's played.
But now, in the lull between the
dead of winter and the buds of
spring, we must scour the web to
salivate over the lineups already
confirmed and those that, for
now, are justrumors - under-the-
table whispers that may, just-may,
bare some iota of truth.
As it stands now, of the sum-
mer's musical triple crown -
namely, Coachella, Bonnaroo
and Lollapalooza - only the first
two have officially released their
arsenals of artists for 2012. Lol-
lapalooza, being the latest of the
three, typically doesn't make such
an announcement until the mid-
die of spring, but they've never
been afraid to give an early taste
of whowill be headlining,sobeon
alert in the coming weeks. That's
not to say there hasn't been some
juicy gossip and speculation in
the meantime - but more on that
later.
Coachella has always prom-
ised big names in the past, and
boy, will it deliver this year. Tak-
ing place over two consecutive
weekends (April 13-15 and 20-22),
guests can expect to see the Black
Keys, Radiohead, Dr. Dre, Snoop
Dogg, the Arctic Monkeys, M83,
the Shins, Bon Iver and a collec-
tion of non-headliners that will
rock your socks off (literally).

night on Greek bailout plan

H AND MAXI MOMUSIELIK/AP
Police hold back relatives of inmates outside Apodaca correctional state facility on the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico as
they try to get past the gates on Sunday.
In-mate slaughter sheds light
on Mexican prison problems

Guards helped
inmates escape,
44 killed in riot
Sunday
MONTERREY, Mexico - Thee
revelation that guards likely
helped members of the violent
Zetas drug cartel slaughter 44
rival inmates and break out of
a northern Mexico jail throws
new attention on the enormous
corruption inside the country's
overcrowded, underfunded
prisons.
The top officials and as many
as 18 guards at the Apodaca
prison may have helped 30 Zetas
escape during the confusion of a
riot early Sunday in which other
Zetas fatally bludgeoned and
knifed 44 members of the rival
Gulf cartel, Nuevo Leon Gov.
Rodrigo Medina said yesterday.
The massacre in this north-
ern state was one of the worst
prison killings in Mexico in
at least a quarter-century and
exposed another weak insti-
tution that President Felipe
Calderon is relying on to fight
his drug war.
Mexico has only six federal
prisons, and so sends many of its
dangerous cartel suspects and

inmates to ill-prepared, over-
crowded state penitentiaries.
Drug trafficking, weapons pos-
session and money laundering
are all considered federal crimes
in Mexico.
"The Mexican prison sys-
tem has collapsed," said Raul
Benitez, a professor at Mexico's
National Autonomous Univer-
sity who studies security issues.
"The prisons in some states are
controlled by organized crime."
An increase in organized
crime, extortion, drug traffick-
ing and kidnapping has swelled
Mexico's prison population
almost 50 percent since 2000.
But the government has built
no new federal prisons since
Calderon launched an offensive
against drug cartels when he
took office in late 2006, leaving
existing jails overcrowded.
Calderon's administration
has renovated three existing
state prisons to use as federal
lockups.
Built to hold about 185,000
inmates, the prison system
nationwide now holds more
than 45,000 above that capac-
ity, according to figures from the
National Public Safety System.
Of the 47,000 federal inmates
in the country, about 29,000 are
held in state prisons. That has
drawn complaints from Medina

and other state governors, who
say their jails aren't equipped to
hold members of powerful and
highly organized drug cartels.
The federal governmentcoun-
ters that none of the escapes or
mass killings have occurred at
federal lockups, and it cites cor-
ruption on the state level, not
overcrowding, as the main cause
of the deaths and escapes.
"The constant element has
been corruption in the control
processes" at the prisons, said
Patricio Patino, assitant secre-
tary for the peniteniary system.
Prison employees say guards
are underpaid, making them
more likely to take bribes. And
even honest guards are vulner-
able to coercion: Many live in
neighborhoods where street
gangs and drug cartels are
active, making it easy to target
their families with threats.
The same can be said for
Mexico's municipal police
forces, another weak flank in
Calderon's attack on organized
crime. Thousands of local offi-
cers - often, entire forces at a
time - have been fired, detained
or placed under investigation for
aiding drug gangs.
"Yesterday, Apodaca, tomor-
row, any other (prison)," col-
umnist Carlos Puig wrote in the
newspaper Milenio.

"We now have all of the ele- private bondholders - mostly

explore whether they would be
willing to accept further losses.
A current plan foresees pri-
vate creditors swapping their old
Greek bonds for new ones with
half the face value, lower inter-
est rates and much longer repay-
ment periods.
But now some countries are
pushing for bondholders to also
give up on an accrued interest
payment of around euro5.5 bil-
lion on their old bonds, a demand
that could further discourage
investors from signing up to the
debt swap.
Amid the ever-changing
mood over the country's rescue,
some frustration was setting in
among the Greeks.
"Greece comes into today's
Eurogroup meeting having ful-
filled allithe requirements for the
approval of the new program,"
Venizelos said. "For Greeks,
this is a matter of national dig-
nity and a national strategic
choice and no other integrated
and responsible choice can be
opposed to it."
The Greek parliament has
faced down violent protests to
approve the austerity measures
demanded by the eurozone. Its
main political leaders have com-
mitted in writing to uphold the
bailout terms even after general
elections in April. Yesterday in
Athens, the government intro-
duced in parliament anothertwo
pieces of emergency legislation
that would introduce austerity
measures including wage and
pension cuts.
Despite Athens' efforts, how-
ever, some countries have indi-
cated their patience with Greece
was growing short.
"We've seen that Greece time
and time again fails to satisfy the
conditions that the internation-
al community makes. ... In the
Netherlands, it really is an issue
that you have to lend money to a
country that for the umpteenth
time hasn't held itself to its
agreements," said Jan Kees de
Jager, the finance minister from
the Netherlands, which has been
especially hard on Greece. "So
it's indeed essential to me, and
also the Dutch government, that
we have control over the money
that we're going to lend."
To that end, Greece is
expected to be forced to set up
a separate account that would
ensure it services its debt.
This escrow account would
give legal priority to debt and
interest payments over pay-
ing for government services.
That would maintain pressure
on Greece to stick to promised
austerity and reform measures
and spare the eurozone the risk
of a destabilizing default.
The escrow account would,
however, be an unprecedent-
ed intrusion into a sovereign
state's fiscal affairs and could
ultimately see Greece forced to
pay interest on its debt before
paying salaries to teachers and
doctors.
In addition, Greece's inter-
national creditors would sta-
tion permanent representatives
in Athens to monitor the coun-
try's progress.
Another issue under discus-
sion is how much the IMF will
contribute to the new rescue.

The fund has provided one-
third of the bailouts for Ireland
and Portugal and Greece's first
rescue package.
"The indication is that the
figure will be rather low," a
European Union official said,
adding however that a final
decision from the fund's board
is still outstanding. The official
was speaking on condition of
anonymity because talks were
not yet concluded.
Some worry that more
austerity could exacerbate
Greece's problems by putting a
stranglehold on growth. Prime
Ministers from a dozen Euro-
pean countries - including the
U.K., Italy and the Netherlands
- wrote a letter yesterday to EU
President Herman Van Rom-
puy and Commission President
Jose ManuelBarroso callingfor
growth across the bloc.
"The crisis we are facing is
also a crisis of growth," the let-
ter said. "It is now time to show
leadership and take bold deci-
sions which will deliver results
that our people are demand-
ing."

Its time for M' hockey to dance

Pitching shows early
signs of improvement

After the Michigan hockey
team's win on Saturday
ight, members of the
media waited in the Yost Ice
Arena conference room to inter-
view the captains.
It was a senior-night win.
Everyone wanted to know about
the emotions swirling around the
locker room following the team's
last regular
season game
at Yost.
After a
couple of
minutes of
waiting,
Michigan
coach Red
Berenson LIZ
emerged and VUKELICH
informed
reporters that
they might have to wait a bit lon-
ger before talking to Luke Glen-
dening and Greg Pateryn.
"The team's doing a dance,"
he said. "Some sort of 'Swedish
Shuffle."'
Everyone in the room
laughed, and the coach cracked
a smile.
Eventually, the captains came
out and the interrogation began.
What's the significance of the
dance? Is anyone allowed to see?
Does Red partake? The usually
stoic Glendening chuckled as he
answered the questions. He said
it's a ritual that follows every
sweep. No filming or photogra-
phy of the dance has ever been
allowed. And, alas, Red doesn't
even try to break it down with
his team. The mysterious dance
is saved for only the most special
occasions - it's a privilege, not
a right. And Saturday night cer-
tainly was special. Considering
that A.J. Treais' overtime goal
kept Michigan in the running as
a serious CCHA title contender,
Saturday seemed to mark the
end of anything negative that's
been dogging the team.
Questions and doubts have
followed the Wolverines since

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Senior defenseman Greg Pateryn has been a rock on the blue line.

last April. When the eight-man
class of 2011 took off their sweat-
ers for the last time, everyone
wanted to know how Michigan
would make up for the lost
depth.
Berenson wasn't concerned.
Back in September, he assured
the restless minds that the'
offense would take care of itself,
though it may take a little time
for a lead scorer to emerge.
Berenson is in his 27th season
at the helm - he knows what
he's talking about.
And after this weekend,
Treais and Alex Guptill left little
doubt in anyone's mind about
which skaters are sitting in
the driver's seat of the forward
corps.
It's not just that they're tied
for the team lead in goals -15
each, for those keeping track at
home - but that they've proven
themselves the most consistent
players week after week. Some
of the Wolverines who were
hot at the beginning of the year
haven't appeared on the box
score in months. Others pride
themselves on scoring clutch
goals but are quiet the rest of the
time.

Not Treais and Guptill -
they've earned the right to
dance with the rest of the team.
They've eased one burden. But
what aboutthe other questions
that remained? Of course, Jon
Merrill's three-month suspen-
sion jumps to mind first. Once
again, speculators wondered how
the defensive corps would fare
without one of the country's top
defenseman. And would Merrill
even come back? Berenson down-
played Merrill's singular impor-
tance for the three months he
was absent and stayed firm in his
belief that others would step up.
Pateryn answered the call in
true captain fashion. You just
have to look at him during a shift
to see how he takes control of
games. Seeing him slam his 216-
pound frame into opponents is
painful to watch, and he doesn't
stop doing that until he's back
on the bench. So Pateryn proved
the ideal defenseman in Merrill's
absence. And now that Merrill
is back? Well, he has still set the
standard pretty high - every
team needs a workhorse like
Pateryn to pick up the slack when
the forward line falters.
It's hard not to look at Merrill's

10 points and wonder how well
the team would've fared if had he
never left the lineup. There was
a bit of a learning curve, but the
defensive corps made it through
somehow. That certainly seems
worthy of a Swedish Shuffle.
And then there's the last ques-
tion that no one wants to address:
that seven-game winless streak.
Back in November, no one
wanted to bring up the possibility
that if things didn't turn around,
this team would be the first in 21
years not to make it to the NCAA
Tournament. Unlike questions
surrounding the offense and
defense, this one had no obvious
solution. Maybe the team wasn't
trying hard enough, maybe there
wasn't any-chemistry or maybe
the hockey gods just weren't will-
ing it. The losses ended almost
as suddenly as they had started
- it only took a December trip
to Alaska to get the Wolverines
going again.
Michigan certainly wasn't
dancing in the locker room dur-
ing the month-that-shall-not-
be-named. But the Wolverines
did this weekend. The Michigan
team on Saturday was unrecog-
nizable from the same squad that
took the ice a month ago. Did the
Wolverines play a perfect game?
Far from it. But the only thing
that matters is that the team can
put a name to its problems now.
Turnovers. Penalty minutes.
Special teams. The season isn't
over yet - there's still one series
against Bowling Green left. But
no matter how next weekend
turns out, Michigan will be a No.
1 seed in the CCHA Tournament
at best, and a No. 5 at worst. The
team's beaten all the foes that
stand in their way at least once
this season. And by that point,
they won't have to answer to any-
one's questions but their own.
So, for now, let the Wolverines
keep dancing.

A new season, a new pitching
staff.
The Michigan baseball team
looked like a much different
squad this past weekend than
it did last year, and the pitching
staff was a big reason why.
Following a season-opening
9-8 defeat to Pittsburgh on Fri-
day, the hurlers responded by
allowing just two earned runs
over the next 1$ innings. Behind
spectacular efforts from redshirt
junior left-hander Bobby Bros-
nahan and junior right-hander
Ben Ballantine, the Wolverines
(2-1 overall) defeated Seton Hall,
2-1, and West Virginia, 14-3.
"Bobby and Ben kept us in the
game and allowed the offense to
get going," said sophomore right
fielder Michael O'Neill. "We
were able to scratch a couple of
runs across (the plate) and get
those two guys a couple of wins.
"Bobby's performance on Sat-
urday was really nice. Ike had a
down year last year, but he was
able to bounce back and pick up
his first win of the season against
a quality Seton Hall team. I think
the pitching in general - it really
helped our weekend."
Last season, the pitching staff
struggled mightily. To go along
with its last-place finish in the
Big Ten in 2011, Michigan also
finished last in the conference
with a 5.09 earned run average.
Brosnahan went 1-9 with a 7.82
ERA while also allowing oppos-
ing hitters to bat .351 against
him. Ballantine had a better sea-
son, but it wasn't great by any
means - he finished with a 3-1
record and a 4.91 ERA.
Both players pitched poorly in
starts in last year's Big Ten-Big
East Challenge, a three-game
stretch in which the Wolverines

allowed 35 runs.
Though it was only one
game for each starter, Brosna-
han and Ballantine looked much
improved. Against the Pirates
on Saturday, Brosnahan allowed
only one run and gave up just
four hits, retiring four batters
while walking only one. On Sun-
day, Ballentine allowed three
hits and one earned run in seven
innings of work.
"Bobby took care of his busi-
ness yesterday, getting ahead of
hitters," Ballantine said. "I just
wanted to repeat that perfor-
mance, because I just wanted to
give our team a chance to win
just like (Brosnahan) did."
Even against the Panthers on
Friday, the pitching staff looked
solid. Though he struggled all
game - allowing four runs in
five innings - senior right-hand-
er Brandon Sinnery gave the
Wolverines a chance to win the
game.
Senior catcher Coley Crank
and Sinnery both noted in the
preseason that the pitching staff
looks a lot more confident this
season. Sinnery credits first-year
assistant pitching coach Steve
Merriman with helping the staff
improve, especially the under-
classmen. Merriman, who is in
his third stint as an assistant
with the Wolverines, has spent
six seasons as the pitching coach
in the New York Mets and Arizo-
na Diamondbacks organizations.
"I think it's too early to be
talking about any facet of the
game, but I think (Merriman)
has done a wonderful job with
our pitching staff," said Michi-
gan coach Rich Maloney. "I
think guys have responded real
well to him and I think he brings
a wealth of experience. We cer-
tainly saw some of the fruits of
that labor this weekend, so I'm
impressed."

Blue makes final push

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Since day one of the Michi-
gan women's basketball season,
the Wolverines have instilled the
message of taking it one day at a
* time.
That mindset is important in
keeping a team from getting too
far ahead of itself. But with just
two games remaining in Michi-
gan's season, it will be hard not to.
The Wolverines play No. 22 Pur-
due on Thursday at Crisler Center
and then travel to Iowa City to
play the Hawkeyes on Sunday.
In the past month, Michigan
has gone 3-4. The only upside of
the Wolverines sub-par February
record is their impressive road
win against then-No. 13 Nebraska.
But even after the struggles,
Michigan is coming off a domi-
nant win over Indiana on Sunday.
That should boost the Wolverines'
confidence, something that will
be important in the next couple of
weeks.
"There are two games left," said
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth.
"Who knows? Right now, there's
so much jockeying(that's) going to
go on it'll blow your mind. It's like
winning the lottery. If you could
pick out who was going to beat
who and be absolutely correct in
every game that's going to happen
between now and then, my bet is
you'd probably be wrong."
Though Penn State and Ohio
State have taken command of the
conference, the competition for
the three other bye bids for the
first round of the conference tour-
nament is a five-horse race, Michi-
gan included. That's why the final
regular-season games will be cru-
cial.
Last year, the Wolverines split
their final two games of the sea-
son, ending with a No. 3 seed and
a bye in the first round of the Big
Ten Tournament. They were
defeated by bottom-dwelling Illi-
nois in the second round, though
- a main reason they missed out
on the NCAA Tournament.
Just like last season's loss to
Illinois, upsets have been a com-
mon theme during conference
play this year. No team is ever safe,
especially on the road, and Bors-

PAULtSHERMAN/D
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth and the Wolverines are enduring a 3-4 month.

eth understands this.
"I just think a lot of upsets in
the conference have happened
during the course of the year,"
Borseth said. "A lot of teams (late
in the season) are determined to
better themselves in the (Big Ten)
Tournament, get in the national
tournament or just better their
season."
Michigan has been on both
ends of the upset-train this sea-
son. It defeated then-No. 8 Ohio
State at home on Jan. 7, but the
team also lost to second-to-last-
place Wisconsin in Madison on
Jan. 30.
Junior center Rachel Sheffer
knows that the Wolverines need
to use their momentum from
their last victory to "keep push-
ing forward." If Michigan is to
avoid another late-season collapse
like the one they suffered last
year, Sheffer and senior Courtney
Boylan will need to continue their
impressive play.
Beyond the obvious impor-
tance of winning at least one of
the remaining two games, the
Wolverines also come into the
final stretch with 19 wins. Michi-
gan hasn't reached the 20-win
mark since Borseth arrived in Ann
Arbor in 2007.
"We need one more (win) to
get 20 and that was a big goal for
us starting the year, to just get 20

wins and keep moving forward,"
Sheffer said.
Sheffer, Boylan, senior Carmen
Reynolds and junior Jenny Ryan
are the leading upperclassmen for
Michigan. They have carried the
team in times of trouble this sea-
son, but when they've struggled,
the Wolverines have struggled.
Though Borseth calls Michigan
an equal-opportunity offense, if
those four players aren't produc-
ing, the Wolverines tend to falter.
Whether they're playing the
ranked Boilermakers at home or
traveling to Iowa, both games will
seriously test Michigan. But a win
in either game will make a strong
statement to the NCAA Selection
Committee.
That committee holds the
Wolverines' postseason fate in its
hands, and though the team set a
20-win season as a goal, Michi-
gan's ultimate goal is to make its
first NCAA Tournament in 12
years. With a win against either
Purdue or the Hawkeyes, the Wol-
verines could kill two birds with
one stone and achieve both goals.
"It'll be good, too, to get anoth-
er signature win (this week),
hopefully for the NCAA (Tour-
nament) and heading into the Big
Ten Tournament," Boylan said.
"But like Rachel said, getting to 20
wins was a goal of ours when the
season started."

fries - ugly at first sight, with a
tasty result - the 6-foot-9 Shurna
is leading the conference in scor-
ing with 20.2 points per game. On
Saturday, he registered 18 points
on 7-of-15 shooting against Min-
nesota to break Northwestern's
all-time scoring record.
Shurna may be the most unher-
alded name in college basketball
considering his achievements, but
Tuesday night has implications
that extend much furtherthan his
personal accolades. No. 11 Michi-
gan (10-4 Big Ten, 20-7 overall)
will ride a three-game winning
streak into Evanston and tip off
against a relatively underrated
Nforthwestern (6-8, 16-10) squad.

basket.
So far this season, Michigan
and Northwestern lead the con-
ference in 3-point attempts with
616 and 605, respectively, and the
Wildcats knock them down at a
marginally better rate.
"Bill obviously is one of the best
coaches in the country," Beilein
said. "Shurna and particularly
Crawford (are good), but now
their point guard (David Sobo-
lewski), oh my goodness. He's hav-
ing an incredible freshman year."
Sobolewski, along with Wol-
verine freshman stud Trey Burke,
should provide an intriguing
matchup at the point guard posi-
tion. On Saturday, Burke proved
that he could find success on any
stage, knocking down a pair of
clutch baskets to topple Ohio State *
in front of a sellout crowd and
ESPN cameras. Though Sobo-
lewski hasn't had the same type
of exposure and doesn't score the
ball as well as Burke, his efficient
play has been impressive for a
freshman in the Big Ten. His 3.1
assist-to-turnover ratio is tops
in the league, and he has just 31
turnovers despite playing over 35
minutes a game this season. As
the two freshmen prepare to lead
their teams down the stretch,
they'll look to secure postseason
glory for their seniors, who have
all been in this situation before.
"It's tough," Douglass said. "It's
going to be something that we
have to really stay focused for. We
can't let up these last few games."

Senior guard and team captain Stu Douglass expects Northwestern to be ready for a battle at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston on Tuesday evening.

Just like Shurna, the Wildcats
are often overlooked by most of
the conference. But they've actu-
ally maintained an 11-3 home
record this season, which includes
a marquee victory over then-No. 6
Michigan State in mid-January.
"It seems like they don't miss
at home, especially Shurna," said
senior guard and co-captain Stu
Douglass. "(Junior guard Drew)
Crawford has been huge for them
this year. ... (We have to hold)
those two toa minimum."
The 6-foot-5 Crawford is right

behind Shurna, averaging 16.6
points per game - good for fourth
place in the conference. And the
pair combined for 41 points inAnn
Arbor on Jan. 11, when the Wild-
cats pushed the Wolverines to
overtime before falling, 66-64.
This time around, the race for
the Big Ten title looms. The Wol-
verines - who have allibut assured
themselves an NCAA Tournament
bid - are aiming for the regular-
season championship, currently
tied for second place with No.
8 Ohio State after trumping the

Buckeyes at home on Saturday
night. Northwestern, whose post-
season chances are less certain,
knows it can't afford to lose down
the stretch in pursuit of the pro-
gram's first-ever NCAA bid.
"We realize that they want this
game as bad as ever," Douglass
said. "I think I just saw Lunardi
had them as 'lastfour in.' They win
this game, it puts them even closer.
I don't know if it'd be a shoe-in,
but it's as pretty close asit gets for
them."
Added Michigan coach John

Beilein: "I just think they're areal-
ly good team. Their field-goal per-
centage is up from last year, their
3-point percentage is up from last
year at this time, their defensive
field-goal percentage (is) better."
Northwestern coach Bill Car-
mody's system, at least on the
offensive end, is strikingly simi-
lar to Beilein's. With a roster
that doesn't feature much length
or athleticism, his team relies
primarily on creating space for
shooters on the perimeter, with
occasional back-door cuts to the
