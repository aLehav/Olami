professor to be
sentenced in May
By ANTHEA MITCHELL
Daily Staff Reporter
School of Art & Design Prof.
Francis Nunoo-Quarcoo pled
guilty to stealing thousands of
dollars from his former employer.
- the University of Maryland Bal-
timore County.
Nunoo-Quarcoo, the former
director of the Visual Arts Depart-
ment at the University of Maryland'.
Baltimore County (UMBC) pled
guilty to stealing $9,800 from the
school at the Circuit Court for Bal-
timore County, Maryland Attor-
ney General Douglas F. Gansler
announced in a Dec. 21 press
release.
Nunoo-Quarcoo's fabrication of
invoices was exposed following an
inquiry made into Main Street Ori-
ental Rugs ini"ltlicott City, Md. The
invoices stated that repairs were
made on UMBC's silk screening
equipment, when in reality Nunoo-
Quarcoo bought oriental rugs to
furnish his home in Catonsville,
Md.
As the director of Visual Arts at
UMBC, Nunoo-Quarcoo had the

authority to approve these transac-
tions himself.
"The case was prosecuted bythe
Attorney General's Criminal Divi-
sion following a joint investigation
with the Maryland State Police and
the UMBC Police Force," the press
release states.
Nunoo-Quarcoo currently
teachesArt & Design121at the Uni-
versity, a studio class that focuses
on clay work. According to a Sept.
28, 2009 article in the University
Record Online, he received tenure
effective Sept. 1, 2009.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgeraldssaid the University
doesn't comment on specific per-
sonnel matters when asked about
Nunoo-Quarcoo's future as a
School of Art & Designprofessor.
"What we find more meaning-
ful is that each set of circumstances
really is unique and each situation
is kind of looked at really care-
fully on a case-by-case basis and
reviewed individually." Fitzgerald
said.
He added that Nunoo-Quarcoo
told him that he declined to com-
ment, saying he had nothing to add
beyond what was already a part of
"the public record."
Nunoo-Quarcoo didn't respond
to multiple direct inquiries from
The Michigan Daily.

Apartment building
renamed Sterling 4
Eleven Lofts
ByADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
The apartment building for-
merly known as 4 Eleven Lofts
will soon get a new look.
After purchasing 4 Eleven
Lofts on East Washington Street

in December, The Dinerstein
Companies - three separate
companies that build and oper-
ate apartment complexes - has
plans to revamp the complex to
attract more students through
updated facilities and new in-
house retail businesses.
Brian Dinerstein, director of
new business development at
The Dinerstein Companies, said
among minor improvements
such as new carpeting, furni-
ture and cosmetic upgrades in

apartment units, the company
plans to update fitness center
equipment and add new print-
ers and Apple computers to the
building's study center.
In addition to getting an aes-
thetic lift, the building has also
been renamed "Sterling 4 Eleven
Lofts," in accordance with The
Dinerstein Companies's student
housing company, called Ster-
ling University Housing. The
building was previously owned
by Joseph Freed and Associates

of Chicago, Ill.
Lori Chacos, vice president
for Joseph Freed and Associates,
said while the company may
have future opportunities for
development, the firm doesn't
plan to purchase any other prop-
erties for student housing at this
time.
Dinerstein said one of the
company's biggest priorities is
filling the empty retail spaces on
the ground floor of the building.

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
'U' study finds being dumped
impacts future relationships

Study: Women
attracted to men
who initiate
breakups
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Singles, take note. A recent
University study shows that a
person's attractiveness to the
opposite sex may depend on how
his or her last relationship ended.
A November article published

inthescientificjournal Evolution-
ary Psychology entitled "Rejec-
tion Hurts: The Effect of Being
Dumped on Subsequent Mating
Efforts" describes a study that
revealed that men and women are
less attracted to potential roman-
tic partners who were dumped
in their previous relationships.
The study also shows that while
women were more attracted to
men who dumped their last girl-
friends, men were less attracted
to women who dumped their last
boyfriends.,
Led by Rackham student
Christine Stanik, the study

examined 198 University stu-
dents -102 females and 96 males.
The study involved reading fake
dating advertisements, with the
students rating how much they
wanted to date, be in a serious
relationship with or have sex
with the people in the ads. The
subjects first rated their potential
partners after reading general
information about the person and
then again after finding out how
the person's last relationship
ended.
In each scenario, the target
had either dumped his or her last

meters around the downtown
area, covering 517 parking spots.
The expansion of the meters is

DDA Deputy Director Joseph

also solar-powered, as opposed
tothe older coin-operated meters,
which run on nine-volt batteries.
Though each e-park unit
costs $10,500, Morehouse said
he believes its ability to run on

Well-wishers gather outside University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz. yesterday to show their support for U.S. Rep. Gabri-
elle Giffords, D-Ariz., and others who were shot on Saturday during Giffords's speech at a local supermarket.
Gunman charged for attempted
assasination of congresswoman

County sheriff says
Jared Loughner
acted alone in
shooting
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Fed-
eral prosecutors brought charges
yesterday against the gunman
accused of attempting to assassi-
nate Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and
killing six people at a political
event in Arizona.
Investigators said they carried
out a search warrant at Jared
Loughner's home and seized an
envelope from a safe with mes-
sages such as "I planned ahead,"
"My assassination" and the
name "Giffords" next to what
appears to be the man's signa-
ture. He allegedly purchased the
Glock pistol used in the attack in
November at Sportsman's Ware-
house in Tucson.
Court documents also show
that Loughner had contact with
Giffords in the past. Other evi-
dence included a letter addressed
to him from Giffords' congres-
sional stationery in which she
thanked him for attending a
"Congress on your Corner" event
at a mall in Tucson in 2007.
Heather Williams, the first
assistant federal public defender
in Arizona, says the 22-year-old
suspect doesn't yet have a law-
yer, but that her office is working
to get one appointed. Williams'

office is asking for an outside
attorney because one of those
killed was U.S. District Judge
John M. Roll.
Pima County Sheriff Clarence-
Dupnik said Sunday that Lough-
ner acted alone.
Meanwhile, authorities
released 911 calls in which a per-
son witnessing the mass shooting
outside a grocery store in Tucson
describes a frantic scene and says,
"I do believe Gabby Giffords was
hit."
Loughner fired at Giffords'
district director and shot indis-
criminately at staffers and others
standing in line to talk to the con-
gresswoman, said Mark Kimble,
a communications staffer for Gif-
fords.
"He was not more than three or
four feet from the congresswoman
and the district director," Kimble
said, describing the scene as "just
complete chaos, people screaming,
crying."
Loughner is accused of kill-
ing six people, including an aide
to Giffords and a 9-year-old girl
who was born on Sept. 11, 2001.
Fourteen others were wounded.
Authorities don't know Loughner's
motive, but said he targeted Gif-
fords at a public gathering around
10 a.m. Saturday.
Doctors treating the lawmaker
provided an optimistic update
about her chances for survival,
saying they are "very, very encour-
aged" by her ability to respond to
simple commands along with their

success in controlling her bleed-
ing.
Mourners crammed into the
tiny sanctuary of Giffords' syna-
gogue in Tucson to pray that she
quickly recovered. Outside the
hospital, candles flickered at a
makeshift memorial. Signs read
"Peace + love are stronger," "God
bless America and "We love you,
Gabrielle." People also laid down
bouquets of flowers, American
flags and pictures of Giffords.
One of the victims was Christi-
na Taylor Green, who was a mem-
ber of the student council at her
local school and went to the event
because of her interest in govern-
ment. She is the granddaughter of
former Philadelphia Phillies man-
ager Dallas Green.
She was born on 9/11 and fea-
tured in a book called "Faces of
Hope" that chronicled one baby
from each state born on the day
terrorists killed nearly 3,000 peo-
ple.
The fact that Christina's life
ended in tragedy was especially
tragic to those who knew her.
"Tragedy seems to have happened
again," said the author of the book,
Christine Naman. "In the form of
this awful event."
Authorities said the dead
included Roll; Green; Giffords
aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; Doro-
thy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard,
76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. Judge
Roll had just stopped by to see his
friend Giffords after attending I
Mass.

WAYNE, Mich.
Store explosion
investigation
" commences
A Michigan Public Service
Commission spokeswoman said
yesterday a full investigation of the
gas main explosion that destroyed
a furniture store and killed two
people is likely to take months.
Spokeswoman Judy Palnau told
The Detroit News investigators
are looking at a natural gas main
as the likely source of the Dec. 29
blast at Wm. C. Franks furniture
store in Wayne.
Palnau says the state is inter-
viewing employees of Consumers
Energy, which operates the natu-
ral gas line, and having a section of
the damaged gas line analyzed.
The blast killed 64-year-old
James Zell and 54-year-old Les-
lie Machniak. Sixty-four-year-old
store owner Paul Franks is in fair
condition in the burn center of
University of Michigan medical
center in Ann Arbor.
BALTIMORE
Shooting kills
police officer, man
at Maryland club
A fight at a Baltimore nightclub
spilled onto the street yesterday
and led to an eruption of gunfire
that killed a police officer and
another man and left four people
hurt, police said.
One of those wounded also was
a police officer, who was shot in
the leg, said police spokesman
Anthony Guglielmi. Investigators
were trying to determine if officers
may have fired on a fellow officer
whose badge and other identify-
ing markings came off his uniform
during the scuffle, he said.
No arrests have been made, but
dozens of people were being ques-
tioned, Guglielmi said.
"This is an absolutely horrible
incident ... I prayed we would
never lose another officer, but here
we are again," Mayor Stephanie
Rawlings-Blake said. An off-duty
Baltimore detective was killed in
October when he was hit in the
head during an argument over a
parking space.
NEW YORK CITY
Portuguese
journalist found
slain, castrated
A male model who had recently
been a contestant on a Portuguese
reality TV show was taken into
police custody hours after his
companion, a celebrity Portuguese
television journalist, was found
castrated and bludgeoned to death
in a New York City hotel.
The journalist, 65-year-old Car-
los Castro, had arrived in the U.S.
in late December in the company
of his young boyfriend, the model
Renato Seabra, to see some Broad-
way shows and spend New Year's
Eve in Times Square, according to

a family friend.
There had been some friction
between the two men toward the
end of the trip, but nothing to sug-
gest that anything horrible was
about to happen, said the friend,
Luis Pires, the editor of the Portu-
guese language newspaper Luso-
Americano.
"I think that they were a lit-
tle bit upset with each other, for
jealousy reasons," Pires told The
Associated Press.
YANGON, Myanmar
Parliament to
hold first session
0 n 22 years
Myanmar's new parliament
will hold its first session in 22
years on Jan. 31, state radio said
today, an event the country's mili-
tary rulers hail as one of the final
steps in its self-styled "roadmap
to democracy."
The new legislature was elect-
ed in polls last year decried as
unfair by the opposition parties,
including that of Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,
who was recently freed from
house arrest.
The country's 1,154 lawmak-
ers will meet in a massive new
building in the remote capital of
Naypyitaw, the brief announce-
ment said. It will be the first par-
liamentary session since a 1988
meeting in the old capital of Ran-
goon, which the junta renamed
Yangon a year later.

STUDY
From Page 1A
partner, had been dumped or had
chosen not to provide information
about the breakup.
Stanik and her collaborators,
Phoebe Ellsworth, a Frank Mur-
phy distinguished professor of law
and psychology at the University of
Michigan, and Robert Kurzban, an
associate professor of psychology
at the University of Pennsylvania
designed the study to look at how
people consider the opinions of
others when assessing a potential
romantic partner.
This type of "social learning,"
the study states, is especially valu-
able in situations in which the
"correct answer" is ambiguous and
the cost of learning is high, as is
the case when choosing a mate for
reproduction.
When it comes to dating, the
study states that a person can save
time gathering information about
another person by talking to a pre-
vious partner who has invested a
lot of time in the relationship and
already has a lot of information
about the person in question.
"In many cases, like online dat-
ing, people only have information
from the target person," Stanik
wrote in an e-mail interview.
"However, when a person tells you
about how his or her last relation-
ship ended, or how he or she has
fared on the dating market in gen-
eral, it gives you some sense of how
others, who have more informa-
tion, have evaluated him or her."
Stanik and her colleagues
hypothesized that having been
dumped by a previous partner
would lessen a person's attrac-
tiveness to the opposite sex - a
hypothesis that was supported by
the results of their study.
Stanik, Kurzban and Ellsworth
didn't, however, have any official
predictions for how participants
would react to the other twobreak-
up scenarios. Stanik wrote that she
was surprised to find a difference
in the way men and women reacted

to finding out their potential part-
ners ended their last relationships.
The study's results show that
finding out a man had rejected his
last partner significantly increased
a woman's desire to have sex with
him but didn't affect her desire to
have a long-term relationship with
him.
For men, learning that a woman
had rejected her last partner didn't
affect a man's desire to have a
sexual relationship with' her but
decreased his desire to have a long-
term relationship with her.
Stanik said she isn't sure what
to make of these results but would
be interested in conducting further
research.
While the study revealed inter-
esting information about how
social learning impacts mate
assessment, Stanik said, it didn't
provide any insight into why men
and women reacted the way they
did.
"In future research we'd like
to examine this process in more
detail so we can understand what
it is about knowing a person was

the dumping that influences peo-
ple's decisions about whether or
not they would like to date them,"
she wrote.
Ellsworth said it was also sur-
prising how participants reacted to
potential partners who chose not
to disclose how their last relation-
ship ended. That group was meant
to serve as the neutral group in the
study, she said.
"It turned out it wasn't neutral
at all," Ellsworth said.
Though women felt more
strongly, Ellsworth explained that
both genders showed less inter-
est in having either a sexual or a
long-term relationship with a per-
son who chose not to disclose the
details of his or her last breakup.
For all three situations, the
study showed that subjects' opin-
ions were varied more when they
were considering partners for a
long-term relationship as opposed
to a sexual one.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
4 Eleven Lofts on the corner of East Washington Street and SouthDivision Street will be renovated this year. Upgrades will
include new equipment in the fitness center and retail stores on the first floor of the building.

4 ELEVEN LOFTS
From Page 1A
One of the retail spaces has been
leased to a Subway franchisee
that is expected to open in early
April, according to a Nov. 11
Michigan Daily article.
Other retail spaces on the
building's first floor have been
vacant since the apartment
building opened in 2009.
"We think (the retail stores)
will add to the vibrancy of the
neighborhood," Dinerstein said.
"It will be a great amenity for

the residents that live above."
Dinerstein said his company
hopes to satisfy the needs of stu-
dents, but added that he is open
to meeting the needs of non-stu-
dents as well.
Dinerstein said though Ster-
ling 4 Eleven is farther from
campus than other apartment
complexes, he said it offers
superior amenities for its resi-
dents.
"We have a full-time profes-
sional staff," Dinerstein said,
adding that the company is
retaining the building's current
staff, including maintenance

employees.
But LSA junior Renee Dhar, a
current Sterling 4 Eleven resi-
dent, said she has had problems
with the staff in the past.
"I've used maintenance
before, and it took days to get (a
hold of them)," she said.
Dhar said she is looking for-
ward to the new computers in
the study center, as well as new
fitness equipment, since she
said some current machines
haven't been functioning prop-
erly. Having Subway below her
apartment will also be very con-
venient, she said.


VINTAGE STORE
From Page 1A
because its affordable.
Bregman said he bought a
"great suit" for $80.
Seventy-five percent of the
store's inventory is less than
$35, according to Elias.
But Engineering freshman
Emily Carroll said she had
mixed feelings about the new
shop's inventory.
"They had interesting stuff,
but some of the stuff they modi-
fied too much, like adding too
many studs," Carroll said.
Carroll added that she prefers
The Getup Vintage Clothing,

a vintage store on South State
Street.
"Even though (The Getup is)
more expensive, they have more
things," she said.
Bregman, as well as Ryan
Shea, a junior at Ann Arbor
Community High School, both
said they like The Vintage
Twin's friendly atmosphere and
knowledgeable staff.
"(The employees) obviously
know what they are talking
about," Shea said.
Elias, however, refuses to
call her employees anything but
"stylists" - many of whom are
also artists whose work is on
display in the store.
Elias said she hopes to accom-

modate a broad range of custom-
ers through consistently good
service.
"We would like to make this
so that people who are comfort-
able shopping in department
stores are comfortable shopping
here," Elias said.
With just a few days since she
opened shop, Elias said she's
uncertain what the future holds
for her new business. Elias said
she only has a three-month lease
on the store's current space and
will have to see how business
goes before deciding whether or
not to renew.
"We're just taking it one
month at a time, one week at a
time," Elias said.

U.S., China attempt to

Defense chiefs to
form group to
discuss affairs
BEIJING (AP) - The U.S. and
Chinese defense chiefs took a step
today toward mending frayed rela-
tions between their powerful mili-
taries, though China warned ties
could be cut again if Washington
does not heed-Beijing's wishes.
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert
Gates and Chinese Defense Minis-
ter Liang Guanglie, after a morning
of talks, agreed to set up a work-
ing group to explore a more for-
mal, regular dialogue on strategic
issues.
The agreement, along with
Gates' visit, marks the symbolic
end to a rocky year in which Bei-
jing cut off defense ties with the
United States over arms sales to
Taiwan, the democratic island
China claims, and objected to U.S.
naval maneuvers in the Yellow
Sea. Gates also extended an invi-
tation to the chief of the People's
Liberation Army's general staff to

visit Washington in the firsthalf of
this year.
"I come away from these meet-
ings convinced that the PLA lead-
ership is as committed to fulfilling
the mandate of our two presidents
as I am," Gates said at a news brief-
ing.
But the step forward on strate-
gic talks falls short Qf protecting
ties between the militaries from
further ruptures. Liang, who is a
PLA general, refused to guarantee
that Beijing would refrain from sus-
pending military ties in the future,
especially if there are future arms
sales to Taiwan.
Such arms sales "severely dam-
age China's core interests," Liang
told reporters after the talks. The
U.S., he said, needs to pay more
attention to what China wants.
Gates' four-day trip to Beijing
comes a weekbefore Chinese Presi-
dent Hu Jintaogoes to Washington,
and both governments are trying to
smooth over substantial friction
over trade, North Korea's and Iran's
nuclear programs and China's gen-
erally more assertive diplomatic
posture.

Sudanese foresee
Christian South
seceding from
North
JUBA, Sudan (AP) - Men and
women walked to election sta-
tions in the middle of the night
yesterday to create a new nation:
Southern Sudan. Some broke out
into spontaneous song in the long
lines. And a veteran of Sudan's
two-decade civil war, a conflict
that left 2 million people dead,
choked back tears.
"We lost a lot of people," said
Lt. Col. William Ngang Ayuen,
who was snapping pictures of
camouflaged soldiers waiting in
long lines to vote. The 48-year-
old turned away from his com-
rades for a moment to maintain
composure.
"Today is good for them."
Thousands of people began
castingballots yesterday during a
weeklong vote to choose the des-
tiny of this war-ravaged and des-
perately poor but oil-rich region.
Because only 15 percent of south-
ern Sudan's 8.7 million people can
read, the ballot choices were as
simple as could be: a drawing of a
single hand marked "separation"
and another of clasped hands
marked "unity."
Long lines snaked through the
southern capital of Juba. In rural
areas, tribesmen carrying bows
and arrows walked dirt paths
from their straw huts to one-
room schools to vote.
Almost everyone - includ-
ing Sudan's President Omar Al-
Bashir, who has been indicted for
war crimes in the western Sudan
region of Darfur - agrees that
the mainly Christian south will
secede from the mainly Muslim
north.
"We are saying goodbye to
Khartoum, the capital of old
Sudan. We are coming to have our
own capital here in Juba," said
Tom Drani, a 48-year-old motor-
cycle taxi driver. He predicted
100 percent support for indepen-
dence or something close to it.

Southern Sudan is among the
world's poorest regions. The
entire France-sized region has
only 30 miles (50 kilometers)
of paved roads. The U.N. says a
15-year-old girl here has a high-
er chance of dying in childbirth
than finishing school.
Southerners, who mainly
define themselves as African,
have long resented their underde-
velopment, accusing the northern
Arab-dominated government of
taking their oil revenues without
investing in the south.
This week's referendum is part
of the peace deal that ended the
1983-2005 civil war between the
north and south. Northerners
had no say in the voting process
and the western region of Darfur,
which belongs to the north, is not
affected by the vote.
Independence won't be final-
ized until July, and many issues
are yet to be worked out, includ-
ing north-south oil rights, water
rights to the White Nile, border
demarcation and the status of
the contested region of Abyei, a
north-south border region where
the biggest threat of a return to
conflict exists. Most of Sudan's oil
is in the south, while the pipelines
to the sea run through the north,
tying the two regions together
economically.
Southern Sudan President
Salva Kiir, wearing his trade-
mark black cowboy hat, was vis-
ibly emotional as he remembered
those killed in the north-south
war. Kiir voted at the mausoleum
of rebel hero John Garang.
"I am sure that they didn't
die in vain," he told the crowd.
Women chanted and one man
waved a sign saying: "A road
toward sovereignty. A new nation
to be born on the African conti-
nentT!!"
Many voters lined .up in the
middle of the night, and some
slept at the site of Garang's grave.
Among the voters was Julia
Kiden.
"We feel that after the refer-
endum we will be delivered from
oppression from the north," the
37-year-old said.
President Barack Obama

hailed the start of the referen-
dum, which he said will have con-
sequences not only for Sudan, but
also for sub-Saharan Africa and
the world.
"We know that there are those
who may try to disrupt.-the vot-
ing," Obama said in a statement.
But he called on those who
oppose the poll to allow it to go
forward without "intimidation
and coercion."
Foreign officials including for-
mer U.S. President Jimmy Carter,
Sen. John Kerry and actor and
Sudan activist George Clooney
were in Juba for the start of the
vote. Former U.N. Secretary-Gen-
eral Kofi Annan told a news con-
ference that most people in Sudan
are tired of war.
"There is enough in history to
tell us that enmity between peo-
ples need not last forever, and bit-
ter enemies have made peace, and
today many parts of the world
live peacefully together and it can
and should happen here also in
Sudan," he said.
Sudan, geographically the
largest country on the conti-
nent, will lose a third of its land,
nearly a quarter of its population
and much of its oil if the south
secedes. Khartoum's only conso-
lation will be that the pipelines to
get the product to market all run
through its territory.
The U.S. offered Khartoum a
range of incentives for a peaceful
southern vote, including removal
from its list of state sponsors of
terrorism. In recent weeks Al-
Bashir has sought to play down
fears of potential violence, saying
the north will accept a vote for
secession.
"The world will be watching in
the coming days, and the United
States will remain fully commit-
ted to helping the parties solve
critical post-referendum issues
regardless of-the outcome of the
vote," Obama said in the state-
ment.
There were reports of violence
in Abyei, a region that had also
been scheduled to hold a self-
determination referendum but
whose fate will now be settled by
north-south negotiations.

Planting the seeds
A2 City Council should pass marijuana ordinance
Medicinal marijuana was legalized by voters in 2008,
but an abundance of state and local laws have pro-
hibited the drug from being accessible to patients. On
Jan. 18, Ann Arbor City Council members will decide whether
or not to pass a licensing ordinance that will clearly explain the
legality of marijuana dispensaries and cultivation facilities. The
ordinance is crafted in a way that ensures the safety of residents
in the vicinity of these facilities. City Council members should
pass this ordinance to make legal prescriptions for medical mari-
juana more available for patients and to strengthen an underde-
veloped market.

This has gone too far

'm slightly ashamed to admit
it, but over the years, I've got-
ten several column ideas from
"The Daily Show."
This one started
out that way too.
But a lot happened
between start and
finish..
Sen. Kirsten Gil-
librand (D-N.Y.)
was the guest on
"The Daily Show"
last Tuesday. IMRAN
After watching SYED
the interview and
being intrigued by
the centrist Demo-
crat about whom I previously knew
nothing, I decided to Google her. I
then came across an interesting New
York Times piece from 2008 titled
"She Might, be President Someday"
(05/18/2008). Written in the heat of
the Democratic Primary season, the
article discussed - in light of Hillary
Clinton's eminent defeat to Barack
Obama - who might actually become
the first female president someday.
Many of the usual, boring names
were thrown about - Kathleen Sebe-
lius, Janet Napolitano, Sarah Palin
and Condoleeza Rice among them.
But two younger women were men-
tioned as actual contenders a bit
down the road. Both deemed "dragon
slayers," these women were thought
to have a solid chance because they
were Democrats who had fought
their way to Washington from tra-
ditionally Republican districts. Gil-
lebrand was one of them.
Gabrielle Giffords was the other.
And so this column started, sure to
be yet another predictable commen-
tary extolling the virtues of being a
centrist in today's fiercely divided
political environment. As I did with
Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) six years
ago, I intended to anoint Gillebrand
and Giffords as the right kind of
Democrats, and the type of female
candidates qualified and positioned

to win the presidency six to 10 years
down the road.
A few days later, as I completed the
final version of the column - much
different from the first version - Gif-
fords remained in critical condition
in the intensive care unit at Univer-
sity Medical Center in Tucson, Ari-
zona. Doctors cautiously hope that
she will survive, but the prognosis for
the extent of her recovery remains
grave. Six others were killed in the
rampage at the event where Giffords
was speaking informally with con-
stituents.
This terrible tragedy does nothing
to change who Giffords has always
been, the qualities I intended to dis-
cuss. Indeed, in the most bizarre way,
it actually promotes this discussion
onto a higher level.
Being a Democrat from Arizona
who supports President Obama's
health care plan and opposes Ari-
zona's infamous, largely unconsti-
tutional, immigration law made
Giffords about as popular as a con-
gressman from Michigan who drives
a Toyota and spends his Saturdays in
a scarlet and gray sweater.
As a person whose political posi-
tions often trouble both my conser-
vative and liberal friends, I've always
been fascinated by politicians who
can speak to different parts of the
political spectrum. Such people are
worth studying for the simple reason
that, in understanding their political
thinking, I can gain more than just
guidelines to a party platform, but
rather actual social insights that drive
a thoughtful, compassionate person.
Giffords is one such person. A
strong proponent of gun rights, she
also received a 100 percentratingfrom
the National Abortion and Reproduc-
tive Rights Action League for her con-
sistent pro-choice stance. While she
opposes Arizona's fascist, search-and-
seizure immigration law, she is actu-
ally astrong proponent ofsecuringthe
Mexican border. Those who know her
spent the entire weekend talking on

television about what an understand-
ing and open person she is and how
productive and effective that makes
her as a congresswoman.
Given that background, it's bizarre
and distressing that Giffords - the
calm, beloved voice of the cooler
heads - will suddenly become the
face of our explosive political age.
The rhetorical firefight that erupted
at Obama's election - involving slo-
gans such as "Kill the Bill" and actual
crosshairs being placed on political
maps - has finally claimed a victim:
It's the young congresswoman who
did things differently, who avoided
that bitter partisan fight and spent
her free time talking to constituents
rather than lobbying and plotting in
Washington.

In an attempt to better regulate medical
marijuana in the city, the Ann Arbor City
Council made several changes to the licens-
ing ordinance for dispensaries, cultivation
centers and home growers. The most recent
draft makes three major changes to the
ordinance. According to a Jan. 4 article in
the Daily, home growers will no longer have
to register with the city, individuals who
have been charged with drug-related mis-
demeanors will be permitted to open dis-
pensaries and there will be an increase in
the maximum number of facilities allowed
in the city. The ordinance also mandates
security measures like alarm systems, cam-
eras and ventilation systems in facilities
where marijuana is distributed.
Medical marijuana laws have been the
subject of controversy since the legaliza-
tion of medical marijuana in 2008. The
laws are poorly worded and explained in a
way that penalizes otherwise law abiding
citizens. Ann Arbor's ordinance will help
to advance the acceptance of marijuana as
a legal prescription drug. If implemented,
the ordinance will clearly lay out what is
a legal way to grow and sell marijuana to
patients with a prescription. This is impor-
tant for giving many people the medicine
they need.
At a time when Michigan's economy is
struggling, medical marijuana is a viable

source of revenue for many people. Ann
Arbor's unemployment rate is hovering
around 8 percent, and 30 new dispensa-
ries and cultivation facilities will create
new jobs. Not only will increased clarity
help patients, it will also help new busi-
nesses operate efficiently and legally. City
Council needs to approve this ordinance to
facilitate a new industry in Ann Arbor and
support economic development.
While marijuana is often regarded as
inherently illegal, the reality is that it's a
legal prescription and an effective way to
treat many ailments. Medicinal marijuana
was legalized by Michigan voters, and it's
good that efforts are finally being made to
make obtaining a legal prescription more
efficient. City Council is also taking every
possible precaution by requiring certain
safety measures at facilities. The rest of
the state needs to approve these rules and
make the laws around medical marijuana
clear and easy to abide.
With proper regulations in place, there
will be increased comfort and clarity for
those who wish to legally provide and
receive medical marijuana. And this will not
come at the expense of Ann Arbor residents'
safety. The regulations concerning medical
marijuana have been unclear for too long,
and City Council shouldn't hesitate to spell
out the distinct laws and regulations.

The rhetorical
firefight has
claimed a victim.
Fingers were pointed as early
as Saturday evening, with liberals
blaming the Tea Party movement for
creating the nuclear environment
that emboldens the mad. The Right
responded with a sharp condemna-
tion of those who seek to politicize
this tragic event - an interesting
response, given their 10-year love
affair with 9/11.
This is a time when pointing fin-
gers comes so easy. But there's a big-
ger lesson here for all of us, the young
firebrands on this campus especially.
As important as it is to advocate for
your issues, to win debates and to
make change, there is something else
that's much more important.
Godspeed, Madame President.

n Saturday, Congresswoman
Gabrielle Giffords, along with
19 other people, were shot
outside a supermarket in Tuscon,.
Ariz. The Demo-
crat representa-
tive was attending
an event called
"Congress on Your,
Corner," which
allowed constitu-
ents of her district
to meet with her
and discuss issues
concerning the MICHELLE
federal govern- DEWITT
ment. There were
six fatalities in the
shooting, includ-
ing John Roll, a chief judge in the
U.S. District Court of Arizona and a
9-year-old girl. As of 8 p.m. last night,
Giffords was in critical condition.
While no direct motives are under-
stood at this time, authorities have
said that this was a clear attempt to
end the life of a public official.
Giffords tenure as a representa-
tive of the state of Arizona has not
been without controversy, and many
assumptions point to this attack as
being politically motivated. Many
have thought of Giffords as being soft
on immigration, which is a particu-
larly contentious issue in Arizona.
She outspokenly opposed the state's
immigration laws that are some of
the strictest in seeking to deter ille-
gal immigration. Giffords was also
one of the supporters of the health
care reform bill - a decision that
drew some criticism and led to the
vandalization of her office.
Saturday's events were a disgusting
and heinous crime that has brought
about tragedy for the families of six
individuals. And while no difference
of opinion could even begin to justify
the shooter's actions, many people are
pointingtotheheated politicalclimate
between Republicans and Democrats
as inciting this type of behavior. The

purpose of Giffords's meeting was
to facilitate open discourse with the
constituents of her district and civilly
discuss what is happening in our fed-
eral government. Butit instead turned
into a terrifying disaster because of
the actions of a cowardly, repulsive
individual.
It's no secret that politics in the
United States have been particularly
polarized lately, a fact that was made
very clear during November's elec-
tions. Health care reform and eco-
nomic concerns alone have almost
completely separated Republicans
and Democrats. And neither group is
mincing words about how they feel
about the opposing party.
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin
has been particularly criticized in
the wake of these attacks for com-
ments like "Don't retreat - Instead,
reload!" There have also been com-
ments about her controversial "cross-
hairs map" that she posted on her
Facebook page during the midterm
election season. The map depicted
districts where Democratic repre-
sentatives were up for re-election in
the crosshairs of a gun, and Giffords's
district was among those targeted on
the map-
Republicans aren't alone in this type
of display. Also during the midterm
elections, Democrat Joe Manchin,
who was running for a seat in the West
Virginia Senate, released an advertise-
ment in which he fired a gun ata copy
of the cap-and-trade bill. In the ad, he
spoke strongly about "taking on Wash-
ington" and taking "dead aim."
It's frightening to think that
these types of displays have become
the business as usual approach for
today's politicians and talking heads.
The notion that outright displays
of violence have become acceptable
metaphors when discussing legis-
lation is nothing short of absurd.
Political talk shows have become
increasingly extreme in their rheto-
ric, and there is constant talk - even

among politicians - about battle
lines being drawn between Republi-
cans and Democrats. And while there
are certainly large, divisive issues at
play in our country, there are also
consequences for the way we speak
about them.
I don't think that any politician or
media figure wants physical harm to
come to an individual of their oppos-
ing party, but they speak as though
they do. The fact that one of the only
ways that Americans can speak in
support of their party or a piece of
legislation is to deride the opposing
view - instead of building up their
own - is one part of the problem.
Everyone needs to be conscious about
the environment we're creating and
ensure that debates and discussions
are the promoted outlets for political
action. Psychotic, insane people are
going to do the things that psychotic,
insane people do, but shows on CNN
and Fox News don't need to offer any
misguided encouragement.

Today's heated
political climate is
frightening.
While it's important to evaluate
whether the climate surrounding
politics has become dangerous, it's
also important to acknowledge that
the shooting was an attack carried
out by an individual. These tragedies
serve as a reminder that we're all
connected in our basic human right
of life, and my thoughts go out to the
victims and their families who had
that right taken away.

"The Arab world needs to make
it clear that the Arab peace initia-
tive will be implemented," Clin-
ton said.
Clinton made her comments on
the program "Sweet Talk," often
described as the Arabic version
of "The View," hosted by three
women.
During the wide-ranging inter-
view and chat with the audience,
Clinton also urged Arab women
to press for equal rights and said
they should begin to prepare for
changes in traditional gender
roles that are inevitable. She said
she thought America is ready for
a female president but again shot
down suggestions that she might
make another White House run.
"I am not going to run again,"
she said.
In addition, Clinton called
for greater openness, tolerance
and development in the region
to blunt extremism, especially
among Arab youth, that can breed
terrorism.
She stressetl that such prob-
lems are universal and, noting the
recent shooting of Arizona Con-
gresswoman Gabrielle Giffords,
said extremism exists in the Unit-
ed States and must be combatted.

Nearly a decade after the attacks of Sept.11, 2001, the oft-delayed deconstruction of the former Deutsche Bank building at
ground zero is finally almost complete.

said a piece of the destroyed tower
was embedded in its neighbor "like
a fork in a piece of cake."
The building was shrouded in
black as Deutsche Bank and its
insurers fought over whether to
raze it or clean it. To resolve the
dispute, the LMDC, the city-state
agency created to oversee the
rebuilding of the trade center area,
agreed to buy the building for $90
million, clean it and tear it down.
The cleanup of toxins includ-
ing asbestos, lead, mercury, PCBs
and dioxins was delayed multiple
times by fights over how to remove
the material without polluting
the neighborhood. More than 700
body parts of Sept. 11 victims were
recovered, mostly on the roof, along
with parts of the hijacked plane.
Environmental and city regulators
spent years coming up with a clean-
up plan that would keep the toxins
in with polyurethanecoverings and
other protective panels.

E-PARKING
From Page1A
$3,700 per year.
Morehouse said the e-parks
were also a necessary replace-
ment of the coin-operated parking
meters, which were eight years old
and not functioning properly.
"We (were) starting to see fail-
ures," he said. "We needed to
replace them."
Morehouse added that the
e-parks are much more versa-
tile than their predecessors. The
previous parking meters only
accepted coins, but 'Morehouse
said drivers can now pay with
coins, debit cards, credit cards or
an e-park smart card - a pre-paid
card specifically for the e-park
meters.
Though the price of park-
ing generally increases annually,
Morehouse said the increase isn't
due to the e-park meter program.
The current price is $1.20 per hour,
according to the DDA website.
A DDA study has shown that 58
percent of parking payment trans-
actions made so far with the new
e-park meters involve credit cards,
Morehouse said. For a 35-cent
convenience charge, patrons can
also add time to their meter with a
phone call and receive a text mes-
sage when their time runs out.
The e-park also automatically
notifies Republic Parking System
- the company responsible for all
small Ann Arbor metered lots as
well as on-street parking meters
- when the change box is full,

when it's running out of paper for
receipts or if it's malfunctioning,
Morehouse said.
Morehouse said the majority of
the public response to the e-parks
has been positive, but there have
been a few voices of dissent.
"As with anything you would
install that's new, yes, there have
been complaints," Morehouse said.
"There have also been compli-
ments. We've done a survey where
over 85 percent of the people liked
it."
Morehouse also said that while
some Ann Arbor residents initially
speculated that the meters would
be susceptible to vandalism, he
added that there have only been
a few instances of spray paint,
which was cleaned at no additional
expense to the city.
Rackham student Elan McCol-
lum said she has used the e-parks
before and has "mixed feelings"
about the system. While she said
she likes not having to keep quar-
ters on hand, she said it's frus-
trating that the electronic meter
doesn't display how much time is
left at a particular parking spot
and doesn't allow the subsequent
driver to use any leftover min-
utes.
McCollum also said she was
unaware that she could use her
phone to add time to the meter,
and said she would likely not use
this service because of the conve-
nience charge.
Jerry Schommer of Port Sani-
lac, Mich., a third-time user of the
e-parks downtown, said he found
e-parking to be an "innovative and

His sentencing is scheduled to
take place on May 25, according to
the Maryland Attorney General
press release.
Fitzgerald said the University has
a set standard that is expected of its
employees,
"There is also a standard practice
guide that all employees, faculty and
staff are obligated to acknowledge
and to be aware of and to follow that
really outlines kind of the financial
responsibilities of the employee,"
Fitzgerald said.
The University's Standard Prac-
tice Guide includes the "five guid-
ing principles for financial controls"
and "essential department level
requirements for financial controls"
for employees.
According to the guide, "it is the
responsibility of every faculty and
staff member who are involved in
any financial activity on behalf of
the University to be fiscally respon-
sible and to exercise appropriate
financial controls, as outlined in
this document and as is relevant to
their role."

A new e-park meter located on East William Street. There are currently 75 in the city of Ann Arbor.

convenient way to do parking," but
thought it might be bad for people
in a hurry.
Morehouse also said he feels the
e-park system is not designed to
facilitate a quick transaction.
"The person who used to pull
up, jump out of their car, throw a
quarter in the machine, go in and
get a cup of coffee - this isn't for
them," he said. "It gives people the
options on time (and) the options
on payment."
Though the e-parks are relative-

ly new to Ann Arbor, other cities
are also adopting the new alterna-
tive to parking meters. East Lan-
sing, Mich. recently joined the list
of cities now using electronic park-
ing. Other cities include Detroit,
Seattle, New York City and Mil-
waukee, Wisc.
Tim Dempsey, director of the
Department of Planning and Com-
munity Development in East Lan-
sing, said in an October interview
that he feels the biggest obstacle
in integrating the city's new park-

ing meters is familiarizing people
with the system. Nonetheless, he
said the e-parks have "been well
received."
Dempsey said he supports the
expanded methods of parking pay-
ment and thinks the technology
benefits both the residents of East
Lansing and the city. He added
that while residents complained
about broken meters in the past,
the new e-park system communi-
cates with the city to inform offi-
cials when a meter is broken.

"Say hi to your mother for me."
'Fighter' owns the ring

Outstanding acting
makes for genuine,
inspiring tale
By IMRAN SYED
Daily Arts Writer
If anyone had heard of "Irish"
Micky Ward before late 2010, it
was for one reason - three epic
fights in the
early 2000s with
Arturo "Thun-
der" Gatti. Seven Th hter
years older than
Gatti - and At Quality16
laden with a day and Rave
job as a street paramount
paver to make
ends meet -
Ward was always an unstoppable
force in the ring: Two fights of the
unforgettable Gatti/Ward trilogy
were named "Fight of the Year" by
Ring Magazine.

So is it odd, then, that "The
Fighter" - a movie about Ward's
rise from everyman to world box-
ing champion - does not feature
those epic bouts with Gatti at all?
Perhaps, but that keeps with
the most important principal for
a successful biopic: The fame that
followed may have inspired the
film, but that isn't the most inspir-
ing part of the story. Ward's story
may have ended up on ESPN's
fight night, but, stripped down to
its touching core, it's really a tale
of a working man, his poor fam-
ily, his defeated brother and his
unstoppable will to overcome all
those odds.
Director David O. Russell
("Three Kings") allows that story
to play itself out with the attention
it deserves. Ward's (Mark Wahl-
berg, "The Other Guys") boxing
matches are here too, of course,
but the focus is on all the life lived
between those fights, not on the
few moments in the ring that fans

often think define a fighter.
Much more crucial to Ward's
rise, his struggles and his ulti-
mate triumph are Lowell, Mass.,
the town he grew up in (depicted
here as the gritty, rundown ghost
of industrial urban America),
Charlene, the girl he fought for
(Amy Adams, "Julie and Julia")
and Dicky Eklund, the washed-up
brother who trained him (Chris-
tian Bale, "The Dark Knight").
The result of the humanistic
focus is a remarkably genuine film
that rises well beyond its cliched
genre and into the territory of
serious Best Picture contenders.
Wahlberg brings credibility to
the part of working-class laborer-
slash-boxer better than any other
actor today possibly could. Even
nearing 40, he still has the phy-
sique of a legitimate boxer. And,
a product of the mean streets of
Dorchester himself, Wahlberg
needs no coaching or method
training for this role - he was lit-

erally born into it.
The exact opposite can be
said of his co-star Bale: In play-
ing Eklund, the crack-addicted
"Pride of Lowell," Bale is a long
way from home (Haverfordwest
in Pembrokshire, Wales, to be
exact). But, as well documented
from his dramatic weight loss for
"The Machinist," Bale takes the
authenticity of his art very seri-
ously. Here, he is considerably
slimmed down from his bulky
Bruce Wayne physique and sports
a nearly impeccable Boston accent
- the latest in a long line of pho-
netic marvels from a man who in
real life sounds very, very British.
Bale will likely snag an Oscar
for his convincing transforma-
tion, but credit must also go to
Russell, Wahlberg, Adams and
the supporting cast for present-
ing a holistically genuine canvas.
Ward's tale is a classic American
underdog story, but it hasn't felt
this fresh and true in years.

bile waiting in a Mexi-
can airport on the last
day of 2010, I played
the literature lotto. I had finished
all of my vacation reading mate-
rial (for anyone
who's inter-
ested: a Tom
Robbins classic r
"Even Cowgirls
Get the Blues,"
Orson Scott}
Card's lesser-
known "Past-
watch: The LEAH
Redemption BURGIN
of Christopher
Columbus,"
Aldous Huxley's "Brave New.
World" and a few archaeology and
music magazines). I was desperate
for somethingto read during the
lovely (read: awful and stressful)
travel day ahead of me.
Unfortunately, not being able
to fluently read Spanish left me
with only a dozen options in the
airport's convenience/book/
souvenir store. And of these
books - including such illustrious
works as "Eat, Pray, Love" and the
newest "Twilight" novella (yes,
unfortunately Stephenie Meyer's
brain has yet to be disconnected
from any mass communication
medium) - there were few actual
options. This fact alone could spin
off an entire pretentious column
about the sad state of the Ameri-
can novel, as self-absorbed mem-
oirs and a series about an abusive
vampire lover-boy top the best-
seller charts ... butI digress.
After browsing a few back cov-
ers, I settled on "The Passage," a
June 2010 release by fiction writer
Justin Cronin. I had never heard
of the book or the author, but
the description boastd "a secret
government experiment" that
goes horribly awry. It hinted at
apocalypse, creatures of the night
and a female protagonist. A sri-fi,

conspiracy-theory nerd at heart, I
was hooked.
About 200 pages in, I real-
ized that "The Passage," to my
surprise, was good. Like, really
good. Maybe it was the author's
expertly executed balancing
act - switching back and forth
between places, times and a host
of intriguing and well developed
characters - or maybe it was his
cunning style that made me terri-
fied to turn around and see what
genetically modified creature
may be causing my goosebumps.
Whatever it was that gave me this
epiphany, it encouraged me to
want to read the next 600 pages
(yes, this book is gigantic). I had
won the literature lottery.
Where did this book come
from? A little internet research
when I finally returned home
from this hell of a travel day
revealed that I had been com-
pletely out of the loop. People in
It's like Russian
roulette for
bookworms.
the book world have been excited
for "The Passage" since its release
in June. Apparently the movie
rights have already been sold,
which includes contracts for the
next two, unreleased books that
will make up the paper trilogy.
It's rumored that Ridley Scott will
direct the first installment. So
yeah, apparently "The Passage" is
a big deal.
Not only did Iwin the litera-
ture lottery, I won the jackpot.
Out of this random, desperate pick
in a godforsaken airport, I discov-
ered years of (hopefully) quality

After the stagnancy of Ted's

romance is more than welcome in
the landscape of the new season.
The babymaking process is get-

is, that's just how long it takes.
Meanwhile, the sexual tension

Zoey as someone who is clearly

'Travels' crashes

"You may be blonde, but are you legal?"

Drab comedy
a no- Know'

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
The cinematic combination of
Reese Witherspoon ("Monsters
vs. Aliens"), Owen Wilson ("Lit-
tle Fockers"),
Jack Nicholson
("The Bucket
List") and Paul How Do
Rudd ("Dinner
for Schmucks") You Know?
sounds like it AtQuality16
would go some- and Rave
where - they're
all talented, Columbia
funny actors.
But no such luck. Instead, in
"How Do You Know?" this cast
of accomplished actors is forced
onto a rather dull host of char-
acters who bumble around the
screen in an awkward mix.
Witherspoon plays Lisa, an
out-of-work softball player, who
is dating Matty (Wilson), a suc-
cessfulbaseballplayer. ThenLisa
meets George (Rudd), a business-
man who is being indicted thanks
to the wrongdoing of his father
(Nicholson), and soon finds her-
self caught in a love triangle with
Matty and George. Basically, it's
another typical romance - it just
has an attempted sports angle.
Athletics is in no way relevant
to the general plot of the movie;
it seems that every single career
possibility for women in roman-
tic comedies has been exhausted.
But that's the thing - as much
as the film tries to be fresh and
relevant, it can't. Lisa doesn't
know if she can settle down, get
married and have children. So at
first, we think that maybe this
movie might be different. Maybe
she won't end up with either guy
or, who knows, maybe she'll end
up with both. Instead, surprise,
surprise, the "normal plan"
works for her and she finds love
and most likely lives happily ever
after. The whole movie ends up
being a disappointment.
It's not like we should have
expected much else. The pre-
views pretty much gave away any
funny parts and Jack Nicholson's

character (by far the most inter-
esting) is relegated to a minor
role. "How Do You Know?"
remains an incredibly, average
movie about seemingly average
people with very nice apartments
whose lives are infused with
some lukewarm romance. But
this is often a problem with all
those PG-13 romantic comedies
- it's not as though the movie
is completely unbearable, just
unbearably uninteresting.
Part of it probably stems from
the fact that the two lead male
characters (played by Wilson
and Rudd) are completely flat.
They're not even funny. And
forget about realism. Rudd's
character is too busy being the
"better guy" to develop a person-
ality of his own, while Wilson's
character is too busy being an
asshole. Just as Witherspoon's
character falls into the trap of
being an ordinary heroine, the
men end up as romantic stereo-
types as well.
Witherspoon
withers, Rudd's
a dud, Wilson
is a dick.
And sometimes, the ordinary
romance works for movies. But
for some reason, it just doesn't
work in this one. Part of that
problem could be because no one
wants to see these actors in these
roles. It's unnatural. Most peo-
ple want Wilson like he was in
"Zoolander" or Rudd like he was
in "Knocked Up." No one wants
to see them acting like average
guys with no sense of humor.
Movies are supposed to take an
audience somewhere else, to
make them realize something
they didn't know before. "How
Do You Know?" doesn't do that,
making the film as questionable
as its title suggest.

Ladies and gentlemen, after
a storied legacy spanning near-
ly 300 years, the unthinkable
has occurred:
"Gulliver'sTrav-
els" has become
a romantic com- Gulliver's
edy and a chil-
dren's movie, Travels
and it's even At Quality16
lazier and more and Rave
juvenile than
what audiences 20th Century Fox
have come to
expect from both genres.
It's not one of those bearable
romances, either, but an outright
tawdry one. Jonathan Swift's
masterpiece was never meant to
be interpreted with such a shal-
low lens - it is a political and
social satire with implications far
more profound than anythingcthis
movie has to offer.
In short, this "Gulliver's Trav-
els" finds Jack Black ("Year One")
playing a lowly mailroom clerk
who is enamored with Darcy
(Amanda Peet, "2012"), a journal-
ist in his office building. When he
finally works up the nerve to talk
to her, she sends him on an assign-
ment to the Bermuda Triangle to
write a travel article. It's a.con-
temporary rendition of a timeless
classic that completely misrepre-
sents authorial intent.
The discrepancies are never-
ending. For one, save the names of
Gulliver's travel column ("Gulliv-
er's Travels") and the town of
Liliput, this adaptation bears no
resemblance to the original. It's
impressive when an adaptation
improves on an original, like Eric
Roth's take on "Forrest Gump,"
but it's another thing altogether
when a script ignores an abun-
dance of quality source material
and strays one step too far off the
beaten path. Considering Swift's
vision, this remake is no more

entertainment: two more books
and three films. I also discovered
a new, potentially favorite author
who will (hopefully) produce
many more awesome books in the
years to come.
But, most importantly, I played
the literature lotto in the first
place. I'm sure I'm not the only
bookworm who's bogged down by
school work, life and the internet,
and sometimes lets pleasure read-
ing fall by the wayside. Too often,
I don't like to play the lottery
when it comes to packing vacation
reading material. I love reading
so much and have so little time
to read that I don't want to risk
taking a bad book and wasting my
time. SoI resort to re-reading, or
reading slowly to make one great
book last for a long time. Case in
point: I'm saving two-thirds of
"The Passage" for my next vaca-
tion at the end of February. As a
result of this tendency, I'm sure
I've missed out on a lot of great

than a skeleton of the novel's live-
ly commentary.
It's not even good asa children's
movie. After all, the greatest chil-
dren's movies throw a bone to the
parents as well. Pixar's master-
pieces appeal to the entire spec-
trum with subtle innuendo for
adults and obnoxious slapstick for
the kids. But Jack Black's dull wit
takes "obnoxious" to absurd new
levels. Imagine a Manhattan ston-
er who gets super-high, falls into
the Atlantic, and wakes up to find
himself washed ashore on Brit-
ain's beach - and there you have
it. Even the kids will be scratching
their heads.
Furthermore, Jason Segel ("I
Love You, Man") is a Liliputian
with a British accent? That has
to be one of the worst miscast-
ings of the decade. In the minds
of elitist James Bond fans world-
wide, English connotes "proper,"
and the awkward, lackadaisical
characters Segel plays are gen-

an upwelling of discomfort, the
feeling that something's not
quite right. He's great as a love-
lorn Marshall, and even better as
a lovelorn Peter Bretter, but no
one's buying his act as a lovelorn
Englishman.
Writer and director Rob Let-
terman should have stuck with
animated films, like his beloved
"Shark's Tale" and "Monsters
vs. Aliens." Instead, he tried to
turn a beloved classic of exceed-

movie with a lazily implemented
romantic twist, and he failed *
miserably.

I sometimes forget how much

Despite
poor
shooting,
.Blue
holds its
own with
Kansas
By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Editor
After missing four 3-point-
ers and giving the ball away four
times, there were few options left
for Michigan men's basketball
guard Darius Morris in the Wol-
verines 67-60 loss against No. 3
Kansas at Crisler Arena.
The net began to shrink on
Sunday, but the sophomore knew
he had to do something. With just
34 seconds left in the game and
Michigan down two points, Mor-
ris cranked a six-foot turnaround
jumper that sent the Wolverines
into overtime against the Jay-
hawks - it was the first time the
score was tied since tipoff.
"Coach drew up a play and we
ran it and they countered it, kind
of stopped it for a little bit, coun-
tered it," Morris said on Sunday.
"And I was blessed enough to hit
a shot."
Carrying a lot of momentum
from the end of the second half,
the Wolverines took their first
lead all afternoon in overtime
when junior guard Zack Novak
drained a 3-pointer to open the
extra period.
"When Zack Novak hit that
three in overtime to put us up by
three after they had missed the
first opportunity, I really thought
that I wouldn't be standing here
in this situation," Michigan coach
John Beilein said. "We played
well enough to hang in there on
defense, just their defense is dif-
ficult ... There's a reason they're
such a good team."

Sometimes, there is such a
thing as too much patience.
In the first half of yesterday's
men's basketball game against No.
3 Kansas, Michigan point guard
Darius Morris would look for his
options from the top of the key.
He'd swing the ball to his wing
men, and they'd pass it back. He'd
drive to the high post, hesitate and
back it out to the perimeter. He'd
look for one of his big men under
the hoop, but they were consis-
tently smotheredby the Jayhawks'
Morris twins.
All too fast, the Maize Rage
would start counting down from
10. It was like a warning siren that
suddenly owned Morris's head,
telling him that 35 seconds on the
shot clock just wasn't enough time
to penetrate the Kansas defense.

Michigan, despite somehow

against Michigan - freshman Luke
Moffatt tallied the Wolverines'
second power play goal, tipping in
a wrist shot with just under three
minutes left in the game to bring
Michigan within one goal.
Looking for the equalizer with
less than a minute to play in regu-
lation, Berenson pulled senior net-
minder Shawn Hunwick to gain the
extra attacker. And with 13 seconds
left on the clock, junior forward
David Wohlberg threw a backhand
from behind the goal line off Spar-

into the net.
The goal was eerily similar to

Les Miles is the right choice for Michigan

Ihad just landed back at Detroit
Metro Airport, two days after
Michigan's 52-14 beating at
the hands of Mississippi State in
the Gator Bowl,
when I heard
the news.
The Bring
Jim Harbaugh .
to Michigan
campaign had ,,
failed.
My heart-
sunk. Like RYAN
many of us in KARTJE
Ann Arbor,
I had tapped
Harbaugh as the savior of the
Michigan football program. I
thought, like many did, that he
would bring the Wolverines back
to the Carr days, the Bo days
- when Michigan's coach was
revered by all and the team was a
regular in the Rose Bowl.
I hate the term "Michigan
Man," but Harbaugh felt like as
much of one as I had ever seen -
even if I don't totally understand
or agree with the buzz words.
Sure, there was no way Athletic
Director Dave Brandon would've
matched an offer like the Dol-
phins put out for him ($7.5 mil-
lion per year) or even the one his
eventual team, the 49ers, signed
him for ($5 million). But without
Harbaugh in the driver's seat of
the program, it didn't seem like

Coaching Search 2011 would turn
out any better than Coaching
Search 2007 did.
In the past few days though,
replaying and re-reading all the
qualifications Brandon listed in
his press conference, I've eased
into the idea that this coaching
search doesn't have to be a disas-
ter. The Wolverines don't have to
hire an inexperienced coach, like
San Diego State's Brady Hoke, just
because he's a "Michigan Man."
They don't need to desperately
seek out hot coaches like TCU's
Gary Patterson or Boise State's
Chris Petersen - either would
be a good choice for coach if they
weren't so unlikely to pack up and
leave their respective jobs.
They need someone who will
unite the fan base, bring a defen-
sive mind to the field, be a mag-
nificent recruiter and re-spark
rivalries with Ohio State and
Michigan State, all the while put-
ting the program back into the
hunt for a national championship.
It's a tough job, and Les Miles
could do it.
Forget the grass-eating jokes
or the boneheaded offensive calls
or the "Mad Hatter" personal-
ity, Miles is a former Michigan
football player who simply knows
how to win. He's got a national
championship under his belt (hav-
ing beaten the Buckeyes in 2008)
and he builds teams that are abso-

lutely ferocious on defense,
If you've seen any footage of
LSU's Patrick Peterson, you know
what I'm talking about. Peterson
is the closest a football
player has be ' 1ully channel-
ing Charles Wfidson, and he's a
product of Miles' defense.
Admittedly, Miles is a bit of a
lightning rod when it comes to
controversy, having been accused
of oversigning and using gray-
shirts to get away with it.
That's not something that
would help re-establish Michi-
gan's image as a clean program.
But with the program already on
probation, I/can't imagine Miles
would be given any leeway to
bend the NCAA's rules. Brandon
will make sure of that.
I also don't buy the idea that
Miles' teams are "overrated."
Considering he's 62-17 overall at
LSU, with a5-1 record in bowl
games and a national title, I think
it's safe to say that Miles is either
a good coach or has a deal with
the devil - either of which should
yield results for the Wolverines.
Michigan made the mistake
of not going after Miles in 2007
when he could've offered a
smooth transition away from
Lloyd Carr. And this time may be
the last time any disciple of Bo
Schembechler will ever be able
to coach the Wolverines. That
may not seem important - I'll be

Man" isn't my first requirement
- but if the Athletic Department
has any hope of restoring some
kind of hope in the Wolverines'
jilted fan base, Brandon will fol-
low along.
He may not be Harbaugh, who

became the hottest coaching
commodity in recent memory.
And he may not be perfect, far
from it in fact.
ButI have no doubt that if
Brandon announces on Tuesday
or Wednesday that Les Miles is
the head coach of the Michigan

football team, the Wolverines
will have come out ahead in this
whole drawn-out, drama-filled
debacle of a search.
And maybe, just maybe, Miles
will do what many thought only
Harbaugh could do - bring Mich-

Seniorguard Veronica Hicks led the Wolverines with a game-high 20 points in their loss Sunday against Michigan State in Crisler Arena.
Blue loses eighth straight to MSU

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
After beating three straight
ranked opponents, the Michigan
women's basketball team was feeling
good about itself.
And even though it lost to Pur-
due on a last-second shot to snap
their winning streak on Thursday,
the Wolverines played a good game
and didn't lose confidence. When
the Athletic Department sent out a
University-wide email with a video
of Michi-
gan coach MICHIGAN STATE 63
Kevin MICHIGAN 56
Borseth
urging people to attend Sunday's
game, the expectations were set.
The winning streak was snapped,
but Michigan was still feeling confi-
dent going into their highly-touted
matchup with No. 11 Michigan State

on Sunday. The game and the crowd
did not disappoint, but the Wolver-
ines couldn't pull through, losing
to the Spartans, 63-56, in front of
a Crisler Arena-record crowd for
women's basketball of 5,991 people.
Michigan State has not lost to the
Wolverines in the team's last eight
meetings, a streak that stretches
back to the 2007-08 season. There
is only one Michigan player on the
roster who has ever beaten the Spar-
tans - senior guard Veronica Hicks
- and that win came in her fresh-
man year.
But the Wolverines could not find
an offensive rhythm for most of the
game. Even though Michigan played
good defense, it didn't matter much.
Michigan State had 17 offensive
rebounds, including 10 from junior
forward Lykendra Johnson.
"It's likeyouhave togettwo defen-
sive stops every time down the floor,"

Borseth said. "We get a stop, they get
an offensive rebound, and we have to
get another stop. Its tough, and it's
not easy to play that way."
To put it bluntly, Johnson domi-
nated. She had 17 points and 17
rebounds. If the Spartans missed a
shot, chances were that Johnson was
there to grab it.
"She's got a combination of speed
and quickness with thepower piece,"
Michigan State coach Suzy Mer-
chant said. "It makes her a real tough
box out at times."
Despite Johnson's performance,
Michigan was able to stick around
for most of the game. Its offense
was not consistent and had issues
all game, but the defense played well
enough to keep Michigan alive. The
Wolverines forced 22 turnovers,
which led to 24 points, but the rest
of the offense was stagnant. They
shot only 38 percent from the floor,

including 29 percent from 3-point
range, and repeatedly missed open
and uncontested shots.
If not for the efforts of Hicks, the
game would not have been as close.
Hicks scored a game-high 20 points,
shooting 48 percent from the floor.
Shehad aquiet firsthalf, scoringonly
five points, but found a differentgear
in the second half - single handedly
keepingthe Wolverines in the game.
"She leaves everything on the
floor," Borseth said. "I guess you
can't ask for anything more than
that."
However, the Wolverines were
negatively impacted by the injury
to sophomore guard Nya Jordan,
especially on the offensive end. Jor-
dan injured her knee against Ohio
State two weeks ago, and Michigan's
offense has struggled since.
Jordan isn't always a scoring
threat, averaging a little more than
seven points a game, but she sets
up a lot of what Michigan does
on offense with her driving abil-
ity. She opens up the court for the
Wolverines, which makes it easier
to shoot from the outside.
"The ability for us to get to the
glass really hurts when Nya isn't
there," Borseth said. "It's an ath-
lete that is taken out of our lineup
and that really hurts us."
Michigan had opportunities to
win the game, but it did not play
anywhere near its offense potential
and was dominated in the paint. In
35 days, Michigan will travel to
East Lansing, where they will have
another chance to snap their losing
streak. But whether they can take
advantage of that opportunity isan
entirely different story.

By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
It took just one Michigan
State player to tally more offen-
sive rebounds than the entire
Michigan women's basketball
team in Sunday's 63-56 loss at
Crisler Arena.
Redshirt junior forward Lyk-
endra Johnson had 10 offensive
rebounds and snagged 17 total.
The aggressive performance
by Johnson not only overshad-
owed the short Wolverine line-
up, but also brought Michigan's
rebounding struggle to the fore-
front once again.
"In terms of rebounding,
(Johnson) has a real high IQ of
angles," Michigan State coach
Suzy Merchant said after the
win. "She uses the swim move
pretty well, getting over and
around people, and she has the
strength and the power to move
people.
"She's got a combination of
speed and quickness with the
power piece, which I think
makes her a real tough box-out
at times."
Led by Johnson, the Spar-
tans (3-0 Big Ten, 15-1 overall)
dominated the boards, grabbing
a total of 41 rebounds compared
to a mere 24 for the Wolverines.
And by the end of the game, it
was evident that Michigan's (2-2,
9-7) lack of offensive rebounding
was costly.
Michigan State snagged 17
offensive boards, leading to
a decisive 21 second-chance
points. Along with a aggressive
rebounding game, Johnson also
led the Spartans in scoring with
17 points.
Senior forward Brittney
Thomas was another big offen-
sive contributor for Michigan
State, scoring 13 points and
grabbing seven rebounds.
"We're not an offensive
rebounding team," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said in
early December. "We gener-
ally take our big kids and get
them back for transition defense
because other teams' big kids
run pretty well. Our guards
are probably our best offensive
rebounders and as a result our
guards are going back to protect
the basket."'
But this is not a new prob-
lem for Michigan, which has
continually struggled with its
rebounding the entire season.
In the Big Ten, the Wolver-

ines rank loth in defensive
rebounding and 11th in offensive
rebounding.
Because of its relatively small
lineup - only two starters reach
six feet - Michigan knew early
on that it would have difficulty
with its rebounding game, espe-
cially against a Michigan State
team that features three starting
forwards who are over six feet
tall, including Johnson.
"Offensive rebounding is a
concern and it's been a concern
from the beginning," Bors-
eth said after Michigan's game
against Purdue.
"The bottom line is that it's
a physical game and you've got
to move people on rebounds -
you've got to move them and
grab the ball with two hands."
And the Wolverines have not
yet resolved this problem. Mich-
igan has only tallied more than
10 offensive rebounds in five of
its 16 games and has only beaten
its opponent in the offensive
board battle in two games.
And in each of the Wolverines'
"Our guards
are going to
have to protect
the basket."
losses, their opponent has out-
rebounded Michigan by more
than 10 boards per game.
When Michigan is on top of it's
rebounding game, it has proven
effective. During their recent
three-game win streak against
ranked opponents, the Wolver-
ines tallied 34 or more rebounds
in each contest. Conversely, the
Wolverines are 0-5 when they do
not reach 30 rebounds.
Michigan's inability to
rebound has plagued the season
thus far, but there is still time to
adjust.
Although height is beyond the
Wolverines' control, they can
change their style of play, specif-
ically by increasing their aggres-
sion under the net.
"It's all about team rebound-
ing and team defense," junior
guard Carmen Reynolds said in
October. "And rebounding just
comes down to being physical
and being scrappy."

Beilein brings another top team to Criser

Michigan plays
hoops powerhouse
in front of sellout
crowd at Crisler
By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
Yesterday, there was the famil-
iar sight of a man bicycling down
Hoover Street with a sign around
his neck reading, "I need tickets."
For the first time all season,
Ann Arbor felt alive for Michi-
gan men's basketball when the
Wolverines faced off against No.
3 Kansas on Sun-
day. It was the NOTEBOOK
second time this
season Michigan has played in
front of a soldout crowd.
The first time was in the Wol-
verines' Big Ten season opener
against then-No. 12 Purdue, but
that happened during break and
the student section seemed to be
filled with an older crowd. But
against the Jayhawks, the Maize
Rage stretched nearly the entire
length of the sideline behind both
teams benches.
"The fans were great, they've
come out to pretty much all our
games and filled it up ever since
Big Ten started," redshirt fresh-
man center Jordan Morgan
said on Sunday. "It's been great.
There's been tons of energy in the
building and it motivates us and it
kind of takes the other team out
so it's been really good."
In Beilein's previous three sea-
sons, he's brought in a national
powerhouse to compete in Ann
Arbor. During the 2007-08 sea-
son, the Wolverines lost, 69-54, to
then-No. 8 UCLA. But in the past
two years, Michigan has pulled
off an upset - beating then No.
4 Duke in 2008 and then-No. 15

UConn in 2010.
"It's why a lot of these young
men came here," Beilein said of
Crisler's atmosphere on Sun-
day. "Tim Hardaway came here
because he attended the Duke
game two years ago ... You're not
always going to have the second-
or third-ranked team coming in
here. But I do think the people
who came to this game tonight
see we walked away with a loss
but at the same time, I hope they
say, 'I like watching that team.
That team's gonna get better.'"
WOLVERINES' DEFENSE
STIFLES JAYHAWKS: Beilein is
known for fielding teams that play
a strong man-to-man defense, but
in last year's contest with the
then-top ranked Jayhawks, the
Wolverines played a 1-3-1 zone
defense.
"Last year we had success with
it when we played them, so we
wanted to throw it at them and
kept them off balance," sopho-
more guard Darius Morris said
yesterday.
"And the couple of times we
did it in the first half, it seemed to
slow them down, so we stuck with
it in the second half, and we were
getting stops."
The zone defense forced Kan-
sas to commit 16 turnovers, and
Michigan capitalized by scoring
14 points off those turnovers.
The defense also held the Kan-
sas offense, which averages 86
points per game, to just St points
during regulation. The Jayhawk
offense is the sixth-highest scor-
ing in the country. But more
impressively, Michigan held Kan-
sas to shooting 33 percent from
the field, when the Jayhawks
normally shoot a nation-best 54
percent.
"We attacked (Michigan's zone)
miserably," Kansas coach Bill Self.
said on Sunday. "We worked a
lot against a 1-3-1. We attacked it

miserably last year and we meant
to do some different things and
then reverted back. Of course, it
doesn't help when you don't make
shots. That's about as bad as you
can play against a zone I think."
A STU-DENT ON THE BOARDS:

It's not uncommon to see junior
guard Zack Novak fight on the
boards. A year after switching
from the four-spot to a guard, he's
been a familiar face on the glass
- in six games so far this sea-
son, he's grabbed at least seven

rebounds.
But junior guard Stu Douglass
joined his co-captain this, game
and grabbed 10 rebounds of his
own, five more than his previous
career best.
The two combined for half

of the team's boards and both
grabbed eight rebounds on the
defensive end.
"Douglass and Novak had 21
rebounds between them," Beilein
said Sunday. "I mean, they just
worked their tails off."

Following Saturday's night win,
Berenson said his team had to be
more disciplined against the Spar-
tans and "play better without the
_ puck" too. And after a scoreless
first period - in which Michigan
was a little "vulnerable," accord-
ing to Berenson - Hagelin got the
Wolverines on the board first as he
threw a bad-angle shot on net from
the right half boards. The attempt
caught netminder Drew Palmisano
offguard, and the goal was the first
of two on the night for the Swedish
native.
Additionally, after a penalty-filled
KANSAS
From Page 1B
Michigan wouldn't enjoy that lead
for too long. Kansas forward Marcus
Morris hit two free throws to put the
Jayhawks within a point and then
his twin brother Markieff Morris
drained a 3-pointer to put Kansas
ahead by two. The Jayhawks didn't
look back.
"It's hard to defend those guys,"
redshirt freshman Jordan Morgan
said of the Morris twins. "We tried,
but if you cover one, the other one
comes from nowhere and scores."
The Morris twins accounted for
35 points and 22 rebounds collec-
tively. Michigan's defense fared well
against its first top-five opponent
of the season, holding Kansas to its
lowest total score all season - even
though the game went into overtime.
"We'll be happy with that," Mor-
ris said about the defensive perfor-
mance. "For a team that's averaging
over 80 points a game, that's really
important that our defense is up
there with anybody ... Our defense
leads to our offense so if we can get
stops it opens up a lot of things for us
on the offensive end."
Kansas struggled to work against
the different looks that the Wolver-
ines showed them on defense. The
Jayhawks turned the ball over 16
times and netted just two 3-point-
ers. But defense wasn't the issue -
Michigan struggled to produce on
the other end of the court.
The Wolverines didn't score a
field goal until nearly seven minutes
into the first half when freshman
Tim Hardaway Jr. made a 3-pointer
- the only 3-pointer made of the 10
attempts taken by Michigan in the
first stanza.
As the game progressed, Michi-
gan's shooting woes continued. The
Wolverines went into halftime trail-
ing 25-18 - the lowest number of
points scored in a first half for Michi-
gan this season.
With 3:27 left in the second half
and the Wolverine's down by six
points, Novak hit a 3-pointer that got
the Maize and Blue faithful on their
feet. Hardaway Jr. followed with a
layup and Novak hit another field
goal to push Michigan within two

verines took just three penalties on

With Michigan clinging to a 2-0
lead late in the third period, A.J.

team's second power play goal of the
night. Then, freshman defenseman
Mac Bennett scored his first goal of
the season to put the Wolverines up

"We didn't give up," Novak said
about the final five minutes of play.
"(We) stayed persistent with the
game plan. I don't think we really
changed anything. We forced some
turnovers and we knocked down
some shots finally, and that was the
difference."
That was the first time all game
that Michigan scored on three con-
Secutive offensive possessions - the
Wolverines shot just 33-percent from
the field.
But down just two points with 53

knew they couldn't hesitate.

the Wolverines' final possession. For
Morris, the net was probably as small
as it's been all season, but he cut into
the lane, took the fade-away jumper
with 34 seconds left and he drained
it to knot the game.
In overtime, Kansas's offense was
more productive than it was early on.
The Jayhawks made two 3-pointers
and 8-of-9 free throws to spoil any
hopes of a Michigan upset.
After 45 minutes of play, the Wol-
verines walked off their home court,
dejected.
Although they stuck with one
of the nation's best teams, Morris
wasn't looking for any silver lining in
the outcome of the game.
"It's always good to play closely
against a nationally-ranked team
like this, down to the wire and over-
time, but I'm not really into moral
victories and I don't think my team
is either," Morris said. "You don't
want to work hard all summer just
to come up short - that's not our
goal. Our goal is to get these wins
and hopefully make the (NCAA)
Tournament"

verines. Their expectations have
gone up with their surprising start
to the season, but this is still a
team with exactly two upperclass-
men and four first-year regulars.
The scene was telling when
sophomore guard Matt Vogrich
entered the game in the first half.
Vogrich was matched up with
Jayhawk guard Josh Selby, a
freshman sensation.
Selby was ranked the No. 1
recruit in America out of high
school; Vogrich was No. 137.
Vogrich picked Michigan over
respectable programs Notre
Dame and Stanford; Selby chose
Kansas over Connecticut, Ken-
tucky, and Syracuse, among other
powerhouses.
Selby was suspended for the
first nine games of the season for
receiving improper benefits as
a recruit; the most anyone ever
offered Vogrich on the AAU cir-
cuit was a ham sandwich.
But here was Michigan, which
found itself down 25-10, which
shot 26.1 percent from the field in
the first half, which didn't make
a shot until nearly seven minutes
are well below his season aver-
ages.
For the first half of Sunday's
game, it looked no different, as
Morris finished up the opening
frame 2-of-7 from the field with
just two assists. He managed the
shot clock poorly. He struggled to
find scoring opportunities. And
when there were openings, he
failed to execute.
Then, a new Darius Morris
stepped onto the court in the
second half. He was suddenly his
cool and confident self again -
patient, but not too patient - no
longer afraid to attack the Jay-
hawk defense aggressively.
"We were calmer," Morris said.
"Emotionally, we settled down,
and we started running our
Y S

had elapsed in the game.
Here were the Wolverines -
nowhere near as long, athletic or
talented as their opponent - forc-
ing the Jayhawks to play at their
pace, throwing zones at them and
causing a season-low point total
even with the extra period.
Wow, one might say, how did
such a bad team manage to hang
with Kansas for so long? They
should be proud of themselves.
"I mean, we proved that we can
play with them, but how far does
that really go?" redshirt freshman
forward Jordan Morgan pondered
to nobody in particular after Sun-
day's game. "We wanted to beat
them. We were in a position to
beat them ... We were there, we
should've won that game."
It would be unwise for
Michigan to take solace that it
"should've" won, or that it was
even in a position to do so. Sure,
everyone has said the Wolverines
are still a year or two from truly
competing.
And the players could see it
that way - that just playing tough
against Kansas should be some-
stuff, just playing our basketball.
Things started opening up, we
kept fighting, kept fighting, and
things went our way."
Granted, outside of the clutch
fadeaway he hit to send the game
into overtime, Morris shot about
as poorly in the second half as he
did in the first. But there was still
a mood change in Crisler Arena
after halftime. Everybody felt it
about a minute in, when Morris
found an open Jordan Morgan on
the pick-and-roll. With open space
and neither of Kansas's Morris
twins in sight, Morgan, a redshirt
freshman center, slammed one
home with authority.
Nobody knows what could
have happened in Crisler Arena
on Sunday had the Wolverines

thing to build on, a point of satis-
faction for a group repeatedly told
that they aren't good enough.
That would be the easy way
out. Everyone talks about the
future with this Michigan team,
willing to put this year aside as
just preparation for the next few
seasons. The future, though, can-
not just be a convenient crutch to
demand anything less than excel-
lence. Any team that can shoot
33.3 percent (14.3 percent from
3-point range) and still find itself
with an overtime lead over the
third-ranked team in the country
isn't a squad built solely for the
future. Michigan proved it can
play with anyone this year.
The Wolverines, then, should
perhaps just be angry after
this loss (and they damn well
shouldn't be anywhere near con-
tent).
"We feel like we can be really
good, not (just) down the road,
but this year," Morgan said.
Good news, Jordan. The sec-
ond-ranked Buckeyes are coming

Here's your chance to prove it.
played like that in the first half.
With a combination of Michi-
gan's stout defense and Kansas's
poor shooting, it's possible that
the Wolverines could have come
out victorious by the end of regu-
lation.
So when Morris forced over-
time with seconds left, Michigan
proved one thing. Not that it has
the ability to come back strong in
the second half - people knew
that already. Not that it could
compete with some of the best
competition in the country - it
had already proven that too.
On Sunday, Morris and his
offense proved that they need to
stop being too patient and start
games stonger in order to win the
big matchups.

3 4Hunwick earns third
career shutout for 'M'

JAKE FROMM/Da ly
Senior winger Carl Hagelin scored three goals over the weekend in the home-and-home series against Michigan State.
Power play unit steps
up in Saturday's win

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
Michigan State captain Torey
Krug stood just inside the Wol-
verine blue line and saluted as
confetti rained down on the Spar-
tan student section Friday night.
The No. 7 Michigan hockey team
could only watch what they had
done to themselves.
The celebration came after
Krug rocketed a slap shot past
senior goalie Shawn Hunwick for
Michigan State's second power
play goal. It was on the Spartans'
seventh man-advantage opportu-
nity and it put them up 3-1 mid-
way through the third period.
Michigan responded with two
goals, including one of their own
on the power play, before losing
the first game in overtime on the
road at Munn Ice Arena.
But more than the overtime
winner, the Wolverines' 22 pen-
alty minutes led to their defeat.
"It's always tough to play
these guys," senior forward Carl
Hagelin said after Friday's game.
"They try to get in your head, get
in your face. Today we took way
too many penalties. That's just
the bottom line."
For Michigan, Friday's game
continued the parade to the box
that started in the Great Lakes
Invitational championship game.
The Wolverines took seven penal-

ties in Detroit, allowing Colorado
College to score four times with
the man advantage - that's six
power play goals allowed in two
games.
With the penalty kill well off
its top-10 pace from a year ago,
sitting at 41st in the country, dis-
cipline has become increasingly
important as the season wears on.
And needing a win Saturday night
to salvage a split in the series
against the second-to-last place
team in the conference, Michigan
found it again.
The Wolverines took just three
penalties Saturday, leaving an
opportunity for the power play
to win the special teams battle.
Freshman defenseman Jon Mer-
rill, the quarterback of the power
play, returned from a two-game
hiatus after his participation in
the World Junior Championships.
Michigan scored four power
play goals in the series, convert-
ing at a 40-percent clip on the
weekend. Hagelin's bad-angle
shot with the man advantage in
the second period proved to be
the game-winner.
"We got a little more confi-
dence (on the power play), and
our numbers looked pretty good,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said on Saturday. "At least we're
on the plus side-tonight and that's
huge. You look at our power play/
penalty killing, we're not that

strong - not as strong as we
should be this time of year."
Michigan's power play has
been slightly above average this
season, converting just over 20
percent of its opportunities. In a
sport where the man advantage is
often the reason for a win or loss,
Michigan is 6-1-3 when scoring a
power play goal and 5-1 when net
giving up a power play goal.
On Saturday the Wolverines
accomplished both those feats.
And without being hampered by
their own penalties, the Wolver-
ines' power play put the game
away.
Already up 2-0, Michigan
received a five-on-three power
play with five minutes left in
the game. Merrill took the puck
at the point and slid it down to
senior forward Louie Caporusso
just to the left of the net. Capo-
russo passed it across the crease
to sophomore A.J. Treais, who
quickly put the puck top shelf for
the goal.
"We've probably practiced that
play for over 300 hours," Capo-
russo said. "Finally, it worked."
But this time there was no
saluting, no confetti - just a sense
that, with the three-goal lead, the
game was over.
"I thought the first goal was
important, the second goal was
huge and the third goal was com-
forting," Berenson said.

records, stand-
ings, and streaks.
For No. 7 Michigan, recent
success against Michigan State
has come largely at the hands of
senior forward Carl Hagelin - a
Sodertalje, Sweden native whose
roots lie far from the in-state
tension between the Spartans
and Wolverines.
"I don't know why I've been
scoring a lot against them,"
Hagelin said. "I just try to get a
lot of pucks to the net. It's always
fun to play against that team,
that's something people talked
about before they came here."
He might not know why, but
the fact remains that Hagelin has
been hot for Michigan.
The captain netted three goals
against the Spartans this week-
end, two of which came on the
man advantage unit for the Wol-
verines.
"We've all been there," senior
forward Louie Caporusso said.
"You see Carl right now, he can
shoot from anywhere and it's
going to go in. It's a great feeling
when you're playing like that. It's
a good feeling when you get on a
roll and you start getting some
bounces."
There's something about the
Spartans that brings out the best
in Hagelin, as the. senior has
scored 11 goals and eight assists
in his 18 games against Michigan
State.
Aside from his three lamp-
lighters this weekend, Hagelin
scored twice in the Wolverines'
first meeting with Spartans in
The Big Chill at the Big House on
Dec. 11.
"Carl's been a key player all
year, whether its penalty killing
or power play," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said. "He's getting
some puck luck lately and good
for him, because he's one of our
hardest workers every day."
HUNWICK HOLDS DOWN
STATE: It always gets chippy
when Michigan and Michigan
State suit up to play.
But Friday, senior netminder

chaos by throwing a punch to

The last time the Wolverines
shut out the Spartans twice in a

campaign.

twice already this season - and it
faces the Spartans once more on
Jan. 29.
Hunwick blanked Michigan
State 5-0 in the Big Chill before
earning his second shutout
against the Spartans 4-0 on Sat-
urday.
"Hunwick (got) a shutout, but
he earned it," Berenson said.
"Early in the game he made some
key saves, and in every period.
Even when the score was 2-0 and
we had a power play and they got
a shorthanded 2-on-1, he made a
big save.
"It could've chdnged the whole
game but he made the save and
then we went down and scored
on the power play to make it 3-0."

Saturday marked the third
shutout of Hunwick's career.
"Hunwick has played great
ever since he got in the net,"
Caporusso said. "He couldn't do
anything about the goals at Mich-
igan State (on Friday). Those
were screened, tipped. Pretty
much he's been playing perfect
for us.
"We can't ask more from the
guy.'He played a great game again
(on Saturday) and hopefully he
continues it."
TREAIS KEEPS IT ROLLIN':
Sophomore forward A.J. Treais
found a way to keep the momen-
tum on his side.
After scoring two game-win-
ning goals in the Great Lakes
Invitational, Treais continued
his hot streak this weekend for
the Wolverines.
The sophomore scored his
sixth goal of the season on Sat-
urday against the Spartans to put
Michigan up 3-0 late in the third
period.
Treais found the back of the
net just seconds after the Wolver-
ines went on a 5-on-3 power play.
Caporusso dished a pass in
front of the Spartan goaltender
to Treais, who banged it in top
shelf from the right side of the
goal.
"I think A.J. continues to grow,
his game is growing," Berenson
said. "It's good to see him score.
He shows you he looks like a goal
scorer when that puck came to
him tonight."

Biondo, Michigan grab
second at Virginia Duals

Freshmen make impact in
non-scoring meet at EMU

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
DailySports Writer
Senior Anthony Biondo just
needed a break.
The captain began the year
battling sickness, then injury,
followed by more sickness. But
Biondo was finally healthy this
weekend - and it showed.
Biondo, along with freshman
Dan Yates and junior Kellen Rus-
sell, went 4-0 on the weekend,
leading the No. 15 Michigan wres-
tling team to a runner-up finish
in the annual Virginia Duals in
Hampton, Virginia.
The Wolverines (4-2) began
play on Friday with two lopsided
wins. Michigan defeated Liber-
ty, 37-9, in the first match before
earning a 27-9 win over Buffalo.
The level of competition steep-
ened Saturday, as Michigan
matched up with a Lehigh squad
that beat the Wolverines 25-6 two
months ago.
But in search of revenge,
Michigan got the best of the
ninth-ranked Mountain Hawks,
winning 21-18.
"We talked a lot about pay-
ing these guys back and putting
together some great individual
performances," Michigan coach
Joe McFarland said. "A lot of
people were looking past us. A lot
of wrestling fans were thinking
Lehigh was going to get another
win against us. We turned some of
the matches around that we had
lost earlier in the year. I knew we
were better than what we showed
in the last Lehigh dual, so this was
a nice win for us."

Biondo won a pivotal match to
clinch the win for the Wolver-
ines. Pitted against 14th-ranked
Joe Kennedy, who won decisively
in his last matchup, the Michigan
captain was able to pull away with
a dramatic overtime win.
"I wouldn't say it was a pretty
match, but I got the job done,"
Biondo said. "It was good for me,
and good for the team. Earlier
in the season, when I was really,
really sick, it was pretty embar-
rassing how I lost. So it's good to
get the win back and beat some-
one who beat you and help out the
team at the same time."
But Biondo was also just
relieved to wrestle at full strength
for the first time this year.
"It's nice to finally start feeling
better and getting some wins,"
Biondo said. "This being my last
year here, you like to imagine
that great last season. It's just
been something I have to fight
through. I'm not sure why I've
had to go through this, but the
end of the season is really all that
matters."
However, the Wolverines didn't
fare as well in the championship,
losing 24-12 to No. 2Penn State.
Freshman Dan Yates put
together his second consecutive
strong showing at the meet, win-
ning his championship match 8-2.
"It feels really good to start
getting to where I want to be for
the full seven minutes, whereas at
the beginning of the year I wasn't
quite able to do that," Yates said.
"It's great to go out there and
start off strong and finish even
stronger. I know I'm capable of

performing at this level. It's just
nice to have it actually come out
in competition."
Russell once again showed why
he's the nation's top 141-lb. wres-
tier, improving his record to 20-0
for the year. His matches were
hardly competitive this weekend,
as he won 6-2 and 3-1 on Saturday.
Biondo won his championship
match 9-4, and sophomore Hunter
Collins was the only other Michi-
gan wrestler to register a win
versus the Nittany Lions, whose
six wrestlers ranked in the top-
10 proved too much for the young.
Wolverines.
"Penn State's got a heck of a
team this year," McFarland said.
"We needed to have a perfect
duel to beat them, and we didn't.
We get another opportunity to
wrestle them in our place, and we
can turn some of these matches
around and get a win."
The Wolverines now turn their
attention to Big Ten play, which
officially kicks off when No. 18
Purdue comes to Ann Arbor on
Friday. Michigan will then travel
to Mount Pleasant to face Central
Michigan on Sunday.
"Overall, I think our team is
slowly improving, which is what
we need to do," Biondo said.
"Every week, you can tell we're
getting a little better and we
saw it here, just in the difference
between results.
"The Big Ten season is such a
grind, but at the same time, it goes
really fast. You can't get ahead
of yourself, so we'll just take it
one match at a time, weekend by
weekend, and we'll be fine."

YPSILANTI, Mich. - It took
a Locomotive to stop sprinter
Justin Clarke. Bradley James put
himself in elite company, getting
over seven feet in the high jump.
Shot putter Cody Riffle wrote his
name into the Michigan record
books.
With only four seniors to pro-
vide leadership, one might expect
the Michigan men's track team to
struggle to find its footing early
in the season. However, with
the help of their freshmen team-
mates, the Wolverines' under-
classmen dismissed that idea on
Saturday. Thirteen athletes made
their NCAA debuts, contributing
to the successful showing at the
Eastern Michigan Invitational -
the first indoor meet of the sea-
son.
"We had a number of fresh-
men that had good perfor-
mances," Michigan head coach
Fred LaPlante said. "No matter
what the size of the meet is, the
first time you put on a block 'M'

against people, it's definitely a
