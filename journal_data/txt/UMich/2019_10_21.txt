The University of Michigan 
Solar Car team placed third in 
the Bridgestone World Solar 
Challenge on Thursday afternoon 
after a five-day, 1,800-mile race 
through the Australian Outback.
The team’s car, Electrum, 
reached 
the 
finish 
line 
in 
Adelaide, 
South 
Australia 
averaging about 49 miles per 
hour. The Belgian team, Agoria, 
placed first, followed by the 
Japanese 
team 
from 
Tokai 
University.
Engineering junior Andrew 
Dickinson, the project manager of 
the 20-member team, said he was 
proud of his team’s persistence 
through all the challenges they 
faced.
“I’m really proud of my team,” 
Dickinson said. “We did a whole 
lot together. We went through 
a lot of challenges, and just one 
thing about this team more than 

any other team that I’ve been on is 
that, every time I would walk into 
the room and say, ‘guys, this bad 
thing happened to this challenge 
at this roadblock,’ … everybody in 
the room is just ready to go, ready 
to tackle it. It’s that persistence 
that sets us apart.”
Assistant 
professor 
of 
mechanical 
engineering 
Neil 
Dasgupta was the team’s adviser 
this year, but wasn’t able to 
travel to Australia with the team. 
Joanna Millunchick, associate 
dean in the materials science and 
engineering department, joined 
the team instead.
Millunchick said she was 
proud of the team, saying they 
represented 
the 
“Michigan 
difference.”
“I’m so proud of this team,” 
Millunchick said in an email 
interview. 
“They 
showed 
incredible resilience in the face of 
tremendous stress. 

More than 100 people from across 
the state of Michigan gathered 
on the Diag for the first annual 
Michigan National Period Day rally 
on Saturday afternoon. Sponsored 
by the non-profit PERIOD, the event 
was one of a series of rallies being 
held in every U.S. state to reduce the 
stigma around menstruation and to 
advocate for greater accessibility to 
menstruation products.

Part of PERIOD’s mission is to 
cultivate 
national 
conversations 
about the difficulty of affording 
period products for low-income 
individuals, which the movement 
refers to as “period poverty.” 
According to PERIOD’s website, 
the rallies were meant to kick off a 
yearlong campaign calling for free, 
clean, healthy and easily accessible 
menstruation products in prisons, 
shelters and schools. 
The rallies also demanded the 
end of the “tampon tax,” a popular 

term used by menstrual activists to 
refer to the value-added sales tax 
on menstruation products. While 
some 
products 
are 
considered 
“basic necessities” under the tax 
code and are thus tax-exempt, 
Michigan is one of 34 states in 
which the “tampon tax” still exists 
because menstruation products are 
considered “non-essential goods.”
The Michigan rally was headed 
by 
Wayne 
State 
University’s 
PERIOD chapter and organized 
alongside chapters at the University 

of Michigan, Western Michigan 
University 
and 
Washtenaw 
International 
High 
School. 
The event was co-hosted with 
organizations involved in menstrual 
activism 
including 
Corner 
Health Center, Dot.org, Planned 
Parenthood, National Organization 
for Women, Taylor Law Firm and 
Helping Women Period.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
celebrated the installation of solar 
panels on the roof of Fire Station 
Six with an event Friday afternoon. 
About 50 people attended the 
celebration, including city officials 
and community volunteers.
Students for Clean Energy 
at the University of Michigan 
originally brought the idea of 
installing more solar panels to the 
city last year. Club participants 
as well as other community 
members volunteered to prepare 
and perform the installation of 142 
solar panels on the fire station’s 
roof.
Engineering 
senior 
Grant 
Dukus and LSA senior Taylor 
Lind, members of Students for 
Clean Energy, helped the club take 
the idea to the city. Dukus said the 
city was supportive of the student 
group’s ideas.
“We reached out to the city, 
basically saying that we had a 
bunch of passionate, energetic 
students who were looking for 
this kind of like real world, hands-
on experience and we are willing 
to put in whatever work necessary 
to kind of get this to this point,” 
Dukus said.
The 
installation 
occurred 
over a two-day period, Lind 
said. Volunteers laid out the 
panels Thursday and Harvest 
Energy LLC, the company which 
partnered with the city to provide 
the solar panels, ran the electric to 
get the system up and running.
“It was a pretty hefty job for 
two days of work,” Lind said. 
“We’re definitely thankful for all 
of the volunteers.”

The group raised a total of 
$3,295 to go toward the solar 
panels, which cost the city 
$74,000. In May 2019, the 
installation was postponed due to 
safety and financial finalization. 
The city of Ann Arbor was 
able to reduce the overall cost 
through a Solar Power Purchase 
Agreement.
Josh MacDonald, sustainability 
energy coordinator for the city of 
Ann Arbor, said the students from 
Students for Clean Energy played 
a pivotal role in taking initiative on 
the project.
“For us to continue to meet our 
goals, it’s going to be important 
to partner with the University,” 
MacDonald said. “I think in many 
ways, University of Michigan 
students are that bridge and start 

those kinds of conversations.”
MacDonald said an installation 
of this size would normally last 
a week, but the large number of 
volunteers helped it run smoothly. 
He estimated about 50 volunteers 
helped with the project over the 
two-day span.
“We were very, very happy and 
pleased to see all the volunteers 
come out,” MacDonald said. “I 
think in many ways it also shows 
that there’s a real untapped 
interest in this community to be 
a part of sustainability to really 
reduce 
our 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. I’m really hopeful that 
as we proceed, we can continue to 
replicate the same model.”
The 
city’s 
Office 
of 
Sustainability and Innovations 
and their Energy Commission also 

worked in partnership with the 
Students for Clean Energy on the 
installation. 
At the event, attendees were 
able to climb onto the roof to see 
the newly installed solar panels 
and learn about solar energy. The 
new system will be powering 
approximately 
98 
percent 
of 
the building and can generate 
52 kilowatts of energy at peak 
capacity. 
Mike Kennedy, Ann Arbor fire 
chief, told The Daily the fire station 
was excited to be able to partner 
with University students and have 
the opportunity to implement 
sustainable energy sources into 
Fire Station Six.

Some 
attribute 
a 
jump 
in 
University 
of 
Michigan 
student voter turnout in 2018 
to increased efforts in getting 
students registered, and hope 
the passage of Proposal 3 in the 
2018 Michigan midterms will 
make these results increase even 
more in future elections.
Proposal 3 amended the state 
constitution to expand access to 
voting. The proposal added eight 
policies, 
including 
allowing 
same-day 
voter 
registration, 
straight-party 
voting 
and 
absentee ballot voting by mail 
without having to provide a 
reason. 
Last month, the National 
Study of Learning, Voting, and 
Engagement released data on 
the voting patterns of college 
students in the 2018 midterm 
elections. Voter turnout among 
University of Michigan students 
increased nearly threefold in the 
2018 midterm elections, jumping 
from 14 percent in 2014 to 41 
percent. Nationally, the college-
age voter turnout rate doubled 
from about 19 percent to about 
40 percent in 2018, putting the 
University slightly above the 
national average.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
District 
Library hosted a lecture from 
political journalist Clare Malone 
on Saturday afternoon. 
Malone, a senior political 
writer for online media platform 
FiveThirtyEight, discussed the 
role of gender, class and race in 
the 2016 presidential election 
and how those identities may 
affect the 2020 election. About 
80 faculty, students and Ann 
Arbor residents attended the 
event.
Malone noted the immense 
stress that is often associated 
with discussing politics in our 
current climate. 
“I know that politics can be an 
overwhelming topic to talk about 
these days, so I first of all want 
to thank all of you for spending 
your night here talking about 
this,” Malone said. “I hope I can 
be of some help unspooling a 
few of the tangled threads in our 
political debate.
Malone began her discussion 
by explaining the concept of 
electability. Malone said when 
people discuss a candidate being 
more “electable,” they are often 
describing a white man due to the 
biases that exist in this country.

They embody the Michigan 
difference.”
Dickinson 
said 
the 
team 
designed Electrum about one year 
ago and began construction in 
May. The team made aerodynamic 
changes in the nose and canopy 
areas of the car and added new 
solar cells and battery design. He 
said the cost of the entire project 
was about $1.2 million.
“(With) any new technology, 
there’s always a risk, but I’d say 
these were not the type of drastic 
changes that we made when we 
switched the body style up in 
2017,” Dickinson said. “This year, 
the game was not necessarily to 
make it a drastic change and shake 
the waters, it was more ‘how can 
we take this proven design and 
incrementally improve it and try 
to get it closer to number one?’”
Dasgupta 
emphasized 
the 
team’s innovations, and said they 
also focused on team dynamics 
this year.
“We have focused on our team 
dynamics in order to maximize 

efficiency during the race and 
control stops as well as being 
prepared for any challenges that 
we face along the way,” Dasgupta 
said.
The team received funding 
from a number of sponsors, 
including the University, to build 
the car. Millunchick said the 
cars are state of the art and use 
expensive technologies, so it’s 
important that the University 
financially assists the team. 
She added the University will 
continue to sponsor the team 
because of the team’s successes.
University 
alum 
Charles 
Hutchins has been a donor since 
1989. Dickinson called Hutchins 
the team’s number one fan. 
Hutchins said he has traveled to 
the race with the team almost 
every year.
“We came into town and were 
there when they crossed the 
finish line, so it’s a wonderful 
feeling,” Hutchins said. “The 
number of things they overcame 
to be third is mind boggling.”

on the topic of menstruation, 
the 
event 
featured 
speeches 
by student activists, U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., state 
Rep. Tenisha Yancey, D-Harper 
Woods, 
and 
2018 
Michigan 
gubernatorial candidate Abdul 
El-Sayed. 
Dingell 
told 
the 
audience 
she used to hear menstruation 
referred to as “the curse” when 
she was in high school. As 
someone who had endometriosis, 
Dingell said she felt like she 
couldn’t talk about it because men 
would minimize her pain. 
“I cannot tell you what it means 
to me, as a woman … to be with 
women talking about a subject 
that’s been way too taboo for 
too long, and to be here on the 
first day we’re gathering for it. I 
want to thank all of the women 
that are here ending the stigma 
that should’ve ended years ago,” 
Dingell said. 
Tenisha Yancey spoke about 
two bills, House Bill 4165 and 
4166, she introduced alongside 
state Rep. Brian Elder, D-Bay City, 
to eliminate the tampon tax in 
Michigan. She urged the audience 
to contact their representative in 
support of the bills. 
“If you happen to be low-
income or homeless, you might 
often find yourself having to 
make a decision each month that’s 
unthinkable for many of us: Do I 
eat, or do I pay for tampons and 
pads?” Yancey said. “‘Do I feed 
my children, or make sure I have 
the sanitary products that I need?’ 
every 28 days. No one should have 
to be faced with those choices 
ever.”
A 2019 survey of low-income 
individuals in the U.S. who 
menstruate found almost half of 
those in the study had to choose 
between buying food or menstrual 
hygiene products. In lieu of 
products such as tampons and 
pads, individuals used alternatives 
such as toilet paper, paper towels, 
rags, socks and diapers instead. 
Acknowledging his privilege 
as someone who has never 
menstruated 
before, 
El-Sayed 
drew on his experience as a 

doctor to discuss the health 
implications of period poverty. 
When individuals have to ration 
menstruation products, El-Sayed 
explained they are more at risk for 
disease and toxic shock syndrome. 
He also said the stress of 
inaccessibility can weigh heavily 
on an individual’s mental health. 
“When we advocate for access 
to basic goods that people need 
to live their lives, we are talking 
about a matter of human rights,” 
El-Sayed said. 
Wayne State University student 
Emily Tujaka, the co-president 
of her campus’s PERIOD chapter 
and lead organizer of the rally, 
said she believes abolishing the 
tampon tax would be a good step 
toward alleviating period poverty. 
“There’s a lot of stuff — Viagra, 
corrective shoes, canes — that 
are exempted from the sales 
tax, because they’re considered 
necessary,” Tujaka said. “Period 
products are not one of those, 
which we think is ridiculous, so 
we want that tax gone.”
One table with free donuts also 
had a sign providing attendees 
with food for thought: why are 
donuts exempt from sales tax but 
my tampons aren’t? Public Health 
junior Sarah Jang, a member of the 
University’s chapter of PERIOD, 
said she created the sign to draw 
attention to the “ridiculousness” 
of the tampon tax. 
“One of the members of our 
club was buying donuts and she 
found out that there are no taxes 
on these donuts, but then tampons 
are taxed,” Jang said. “It’s absurd. 
Donuts aren’t essential, you don’t 
need them to live. But you need 
tampons.”
Rackham student Ashley Rapp 
explained she became involved 
in efforts surrounding period 
poverty after a friend working in 
Detroit public schools asked for 
product donations because her 
students couldn’t afford them. 
Rapp noted the University doesn’t 
provide free menstrual products, 
unlike some other schools across 
the country, such as University of 
Texas at Austin, Yale University, 
Saint Louis University and others.

Mahalaya

For 
most 
Bengalis, 
Mahalaya marks the return 
of goddess Durga to Earth 
and also marks the beginning 
of the Durga Puja festivities. 
This 
usually 
occurs 
mid-
to-late September, after the 
monsoons--also a time when 
a lot of flowers are in full 
bloom in India. Coming from 
a Bengali family, I looked 
forward to this time most 
of all, mostly because it was 
the time when my 
grandmother’s garden would 

look the prettiest. She grew 
roses, 
mogras 
(arabian 
jasmine), 
shiuli 
(night-
flowering jasmine), marigold, 
and 
a 
variety 
of 
other 
flowers. Through deep blues 
signifying rain, mellow whites 
symbolizing rain clouds and 
purity, and yellows and reds 
communicating warmth and 
happiness, I wanted to capture 
the essence of Mahalaya in 
this painting. Along with 
depicting my grandmother’s 
flowers, I used actual flowers 
from the past year’s Durga 
Puja to physically connect this 
painting to one of my happiest 
childhood memories. 

Debunking 
immigration myths

An unknown number from San 
Diego was calling me. Earlier that 
day, I’d reached out to San Diego 
LGBTQ+ bars and businesses for 
a non-profit supporting LGBTQ+ 
asylum seekers. I picked up the 
phone, expecting to hear a friendly 
voice on the other end who wanted 
to talk about supporting the non-
profit I was interning for during the 
summer.
Instead, the man who called me 
started ranting about how, even 
though he was gay, he didn’t support 
LGBTQ+ asylum seekers — or any 
asylum seekers and immigrants for 
that matter — who were coming to 
the border. He yelled about how 
they were coming illegally and 
about how his grandmother was 
on food stamps and her welfare 
was being taken advantage of by 
immigrants.
My hands were shaking while 
he was ranting; I wanted to argue 
back, but what was the point of 
engaging with someone who clearly 
would not be swayed by anything I 
said, who lacked empathy for those 
fleeing persecution and trying to 
find a better life? It was draining 
to listen to him, so I just hung 
up. I cried for a while after. His 
phone call was an all too familiar 
reminder of the anti-immigrant 
sentiment and policies that were 
happening over the summer, of the 
unwillingness of our government 
to recognize the humanity of other 
people, regardless of their national 
origin or documentation status.
Everything 
the 
man 
said 
was misinformed and based on 
stereotypes. No, asylum seekers 
and immigrants are not coming to 
the border illegally — they are going 
through legal ports of entry. But the 
Trump administration has actively 
made it harder for asylum seekers 
to claim asylum by “metering” 
them, 
meaning 
Customs 
and 
Border Protection officials wrongly 
turn asylum seekers away at ports 
of entry because they say there’s 
no room to process them. This and 
other policies under the current 
administration — like “Remain in 
Mexico” — violate both domestic 
and international law.
It isn’t like asylum seekers and 
immigrants have been coming for 

an isolated reason either. Many of 
them are fleeing Central American 
countries 
such 
as 
Honduras, 
Guatemala, and El Salvador, for 
various issues such as gang violence 
and a lack of accountability by the 
state. It’s important to remember, 
though, that the current instability 
is affected by U.S. intervention 
in the region during the ‘80s and 
‘90s (let’s also not forget the long-
term consequences of colonialism, 
too). There’s a tragic irony in the fact 
that the U.S. is turning away the very 
people who have been harmed by 
the country’s actions (for example, 
creating conflicts in the region and 
supplying guns to gangs). Many 
of the asylum seekers identify as 
LGBTQ+, escaping a region that 
has the highest rate of reported 
murders of transgender people. 
Other reasons include indigenous 
peoples fleeing persecution and 
farmers 
and 
environmentalists 
who have had to leave because 
of 
worsening 
environmental 
conditions.
As for this man’s comment 
about welfare and immigrants: If 
he wanted to blame someone for 
the inadequate amount of welfare 
Americans receive, he should look 
at Ronald Reagan, who drastically 
cut back on welfare in the ‘80s, and 
Bill Clinton for nailing the coffin on 
welfare in the ‘90s. Undocumented 
immigrants, despite paying taxes 
and social security fees, can’t even 
access health care or reap any of 
the benefits for the things they 
pay for. Refugees receive only nine 
months of government assistance 
and asylees receive none. And 
up until 2009, immigrants with 
documentation were barred from 
Medicaid and CHIP for five years 
after entering the U.S. (Androff, 
David K., et al.) My parents and I felt 
the effect of this kind of legislation; 
we didn’t have health care until 
after we were naturalized five years 
ago.
I wish there had been a way for me 
to tell that stranger on the phone all 
of this — though I doubt it would’ve 
really changed his mind. Our 
country has become so polarized 
on immigration that even when 
people are faced with facts, they 
still buy into the misinformation 
and stereotypes. They forget to see 
the people behind the numbers and 
the policies: people who have hopes 
and dreams and fears and stories 
that expand beyond a border.

Allyson Felix: Athlete, mother, 
activist without conditions

Allyson Felix, an American 
track runner and field sprinter, 
recently earned her 12th Gold 
Medal at the World Athletics 
Championship in Qatar –– she also 
surpassed the legendary Usain Bolt 
in winning the most olympic gold 
medals in history. She welcomed 
her daughter 10 months ago, and 
this will be her first win since 
giving birth. Nike sponsored Felix 
for seven years, but the 
relationship ended due 
to their mistreatment of 
pregnant athletes. The 
track star is now the face 
of Athleta, its first ever 
sponsored athlete. 
Felix gave birth two 
months 
earlier 
than 
expected, had to undergo 
an emergency C-section 
and 
experienced 
life-threatening 
pre-eclampsia. 
Pre-eclampsia 
is 
marked by high blood 
pressure 
in 
women 
during 
pregnancy 
in women who have 
not had high blood 
pressure before. Other 
women like Beyonce, 
Serena Williams and 
Mariah 
Carey 
have 
also 
experienced 
preeclampsia 
during 
pregnancy. 
Her accomplishments 
deserve to be celebrated. 
However, there is much 
needed 
discussion 
around 
how, 
and 
most 
importantly 
if, these brands are 
truly 
in 
support 
of 
their 
ambassadors. 
Felix shared her Nike 
pregnancy story as well 
as two other athletes, 
Alysia 
Montano 
and 
Kara 
Goucher, 
who 
broke 
their 
non-
disclosure 
agreements 

in order to reclaim their autonomy 
back in May. There was a lack of 
support, and no secure maternity 
protections for any of these 
women, and therefore they were 
silenced.
Women are able to hold more 
than one identify regardless if 
they were considered to be an 
athlete first. Female athletes train 
hard, have sleepless nights, do 
not get to spend time with their 
loved ones and have to constantly 
prove themselves as skilled in their 

sport compared to men. There 
should be no conditions about 
one’s personal life, like wanting to 
start a family, that may jeopardize 
their career. Women are allowed 
to do what they feel makes their 
life worthwhile, without facing 
scrutiny from a support system 
that is supposed to have their best 
interest in mind, and this should go 
for society, as well. 
Felix said she now she runs for 
her daughter, for younger girls, and 
for single mothers. Her daughter 

gave her motivation when she 
was unsure about being able to 
run again. I am grateful to Felix 
for sharing her Nike story and 
being loud and proud about being 
an athlete, mother, and activist. 
There is no order that those words 
have to be in for any woman that 
plays a sport or for any mother to 
be considered less of an athlete or 
less of a mother. And there is no 
need for an explanation to anyone 
about the order in which one lives 
their life.

A classroom 
through my eyes

When going to a lecture that 
you know no one in, you hope 
that friendly people sit next to 
you. There is that intimidation 
of not knowing anyone and 
awkwardly looking through 
your phone or doing things on 
your laptop to keep yourself 
preoccupied 
while 
others 
around you chatter away. Half 
of the people there seem to 
know exactly what is going 
on and the other half seem 
to be just as lost as you. You 
hope that someone nice, who 
also doesn’t know anyone, 

sits next to you and that you 
can both bond over the fact 
that the professor is a little 
quirky or that the in-class 
quizzes are super confusing. 
There is comfort in knowing 
that there is someone there 
who is feeling the same exact 
way you are and that is how 
friendships are built in the 
classroom. 
 But being a person of color 
really changes how I feel 
about all of this. 
 Walking into a discussion 
section for the first time,

What we can learn from the recent Ecuadorian protests
W

hile 
the 
Amazon’s 
fires blazed on, despite 
worldwide outcry and 
aid efforts, hundreds of protesters in 
Quito, Ecuador were setting fires of 
their own. 
On Oct. 3, Ecuador’s President 
Lenín Moreno declared a nationwide 
state of emergency after protests 
erupted over the end of the country’s 
40-year-long subsidy for gasoline. 
Along with the decision to terminate 
the 
gasoline 
subsidy, 
Ecuador’s 
government decided to depart from 
the 
Organization 
of 
Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to avoid 
committing to their guidelines on 
reducing output. For a country that 
is fairly reliant on oil (petroleum 
constituted a third of Ecuador’s export 
earnings in the year 2017), it is not 
surprising that Moreno’s recent policy 
has been met with a heated response. 
The end of the gas subsidy also comes 
on the heels of Moreno’s economic 
agenda, which encompasses broader 
structural reform including changes 
to the country’s central bank and the 
code of budget and planning. 
Domestic prices of most consumer 
goods have been highly responsive to 
the end of the subsidy. For example, 
the Ecuadorian price of diesel rose 
from $1.03 to $2.30 per gallon on 
Thursday, while gasoline climbed 
from $1.85 to $2.39, according to NPR. 
Ecuador is no stranger to drastic 
economic reforms. A financial crisis 
in 1999 led to systematic changes 
including the shift to dollarization. 
But Moreno’s latest change, some 
say, is a political ploy. The decision to 
end the fuel subsidy hurts Ecuador’s 
marginalized 
populations 
much 
more than the country’s economic 
elites, who will still be able to afford 
the spikes in prices. While Moreno 
claimed the decision was intended to 
help Ecuador’s economy grow and 
decrease the debt, the decision to end 
fuel subsidies also came with a hefty 
loan from the International Monetary 
Fund.
Protests have escalated well beyond 
demonstrations. As of last week, an 
estimated 50 police officers have 
been taken hostage by demonstrators. 
Carlos Pérez, the country’s minister of 
energy and natural resources, noted 
“oil industry installations are being 

guarded against attempts to occupy 
them.” Quito’s surrounding cities have 
faced violence as well. Pharmacies 
and supermarkets are being looted 
by enraged citizens, and there are 
videos of police officers beating down 
protesters in the streets and using tear 
gas. Outside of Ecuador’s domestic 
panic, we can already see some of 
the early international effects of the 
protests. Several major flights have 
been forced to reschedule or re-route 
as the road blockades have prevented 
traffic from entering or exiting the 
Quito airport. The result of these 
protests has been an odd private 
conversation between two persons: 
Moreno has accused the protesters of 
attempting to destabilize Ecuador’s 
government, while the protesters 
allege that the president has turned 
a blind eye to the effects of the policy 
on the lower and middle classes in the 
country.
Moreno ought to consider that 
some of the residual anger many 
Ecuadorians feel is a result of the 
lack of returns on other economic 
promises. For example, the president’s 
proposed expansion of funding for 
social programs in the country has not 
seen follow-through yet.
Because these protests center 
around the massive spike in prices for 
a variety of consumer goods in the 
country, and because the decision to 
end the subsidies has received support 
from the country’s elites, moving 
forward with an aggressive reform of 
the country’s social safety nets could 
alleviate some of the most vulnerable 
protesters’ 
economic 
concerns. 
This is especially the case given that 
Moreno’s loan from the IMF was, 
among other things, intended to 
expand government provision of aid to 
Ecuador’s poorest populations. While 
the loan has been cancelled due to 
the protests, the IMF has stated that 
they are open to renegotiating. The 
world will be watching Ecuador now 
and, more importantly, watching the 
renegotiation — to see if Ecuador uses 
this opportunity to do its citizens right 
in a time of increased social upheaval. 
Much of the news frenzy around 
Ecuador’s civil unrest lies in the 
equally enormous levels of passion 
and strategy behind the protests. 
Ecuador’s central government was 

forced to flee as a series of riots 
descended upon the capital. This, 
some policy analysts have suggested, 
is in line with the way that recent 
Latin American protesters have 
shifted their tactics to attempt to 
combat corruption. Guatemala, Peru 
and Colombia have experienced 
similar unrest after citizens took to 
the streets to protest corrupt officials. 
While thousands of Colombians 
blocked the Pan-American Highway 
to highlight the systemic violence 
indigenous people continue to 
endure at the hands of officials who 
have turned a blind eye, protesters 
in Peru targeted bribed attorneys 
general as well as federal judge Pedro 
Chávarry, who sought to unlawfully 
remove prosecutors from upcoming 
controversial cases. Just this month, 
Peruvian citizens took to the streets 
again to protest President Martín 
Vizcarra’s decision to dissolve the 
country’s current congress and hold 
new elections — a move that many 
have labeled as a blatant attempt to 
break Peru’s constitutional order 
for personal political gain. In Latin 
America these days, protesters’ 
attention 
is 
hyper-focused 
on 
the 
lawmakers 
responsible 
for 
socioeconomic problems. 
In the age of Donald Trump, the 
United States has seen a variety of 
movements develop around the need 
to address widespread socioeconomic 
disparities. Those who want to see 
change in the United States ought 
to align with those protesting 
government corruption in Ecuador. 
This is especially true for the many 
organizations and movements that 
have roots in Ann Arbor, including the 
fight for lecturer working standards 
and the recent climate strike. Many 
of the people in Ecuador who are 
currently protesting are facing a crisis 
that shares common ground with 
many of the United States’s political 
woes: economic policy that benefits 
elites, corrupt politicians and lack of 
reform. The world will be watching 
to see whether Moreno will decide 
to meet protesters’ demands, and 
the United States should certainly be 
paying close attention.

Primary care should be a grassroots movement
Z

ip code, postal code, area 
code 
— 
whatever 
you 
want to call it, this five-
digit, benign figure identifies your 
general location on the U.S map. In 
2017, the National Center for Health 
Statistics released life expectancy 
across American neighborhoods 
that actually proved your zip code 
is a map in and of itself. Similar to 
how your DNA can map out your 
susceptibility to disease or death, so 
can your zip code. So much so that 
even the Director of the National 
Institute of Health Francis Collins 
is referring to zip codes as “our 
ZNA.” How can a five digit number 
be so powerful? In short, years of 
inequality have left their mark on 
American society. Where one lives 
largely correlates to what has been 
coined one’s social determinants of 
health. These determinants refer to 
factors like “access to healthy food, 
good schools, affordable housing” 
and income, all of which empower 
individuals 
to 
prevent 
illness, 
protect against stress or access 
health care. 
The Detroit News found that 
Michigan’s life expectancy had 
a 29-year range across different 
neighborhoods. It maxed out at 
around 91 years in an East Grand 
Rapids neighborhood, and fell to as 
low as 62 in one Detroit area. Clearly, 
we need to be treating disease as 
not just a breakdown of the body, 
but a symptom of a breakdown in 
American society.
Right 
now, 
primary 
health 
care providers, local non-profits, 
local health departments and 
community members are working 
independently 
to 
promote 
community 
health. 
Combating 
years of inequality will require 
these 
stakeholders 
to 
work 
together in order to identify and 
target a community’s social and 
medical needs. In essence, we need 
to revolutionize America’s reactive 
health system and transform it 
into a proactive one. A grassroots 
movement approach to community 
health can catalyze this revolution 
by enhancing communication and 
collaboration between those four 
key stakeholders.
As powerful as the federal 
government sounds, it’s the local 
government that has the most 
profound impact on day-to-day 
well-being. All over the country, 

there 
are 
2,800 
local 
health 
departments, each one entrusted 
with protecting community health. 
These 
departments 
run 
free 
health clinics, launch heart disease 
awareness campaigns and respond 
to public health threats like the 
Hepatitis A outbreak currently 
ravaging 
Washtenaw 
County. 
While this work is vital, it is still far 
too reactive. Health departments 
should be anticipating the social 
and medical needs of a community 
before those needs turn into the 
next infectious outbreak or chronic 
disease epidemic.
The best way to do this is by 
communicating with the front 
lines of health care: primary 
care professionals. Primary care 
providers include nurses, doctors, 
physician assistants and allied 
health professionals. Whether they 
work in emergency departments or 
out-patient clinics, these providers 
witness the results of our different 
“ZNA” firsthand. The clinical trends 
observed by primary care workers 
on the frontlines are powerful. If 
primary health care professionals 
have the ability to communicate 
clinical trends to health department 
officials, they can tailor public 
health programs to fit the needs of 
community members.
Consequently, informing health 
departments of new data about 
high blood pressure diagnoses in a 
particular neighborhood can prevent 
a decrease in life expectancy in 
this area years later. A grassroots 
movement 
approaches 
demand 
meetings between all stakeholders. 
Organizing consistent meetings to 
discuss these trends will empower 
health departments to customize 
public health initiatives in order to 
tackle these concerns. Furthermore, 
such communication could enhance 
shared infrastructure between the 
two stakeholders, yet another key 
component of a healthy grassroots 
effort. Working together, local health 
professionals and health departments 
could design software that could 
de-identify patient data and map out 
unmet social and medical needs in 
different neighborhoods.
Beyond building bridges between 
health 
departments 
and 
health 
providers, a grassroots approach 
would 
also 
foster 
collaboration 
between health providers and local 
non-profits. 

When 
creating 
treatment 
plans, health providers are well 
qualified 
to 
combat 
chronic 
disease threats like heart disease 
with 
prescriptions 
and 
diet 
recommendations. However, this 
type of treatment is worthless if 
a patient lives in a food desert or 
does not have the proper housing 
to refrigerate their medication. 
The 
reality 
is 
that 
many 
communities have local non-
profits who can satisfy the social 
needs of patients. Consequently, 
these non-profits deserve to be a 
part of the treatment plan.
For instance, Fresh Express 
is a non-profit mobile produce 
market 
that 
purchases 
produce 
“at 
wholesale 
and 
sells it without a markup” in 
food desert neighborhoods in 
Arizona, or areas where it is 
difficult to access affordable 
produce. 
Imagine 
if 
health 
care 
professionals 
had 
the 
capability to make non-profits 
such as Fresh Express a part of 
their patients’ treatment plans, 
rather than only prescribing a 
diet recommendation. Health 
providers could also connect 
patients with local nonprofits 
that can provide access to the 
fresh produce needed to live up 
to this diet recommendation. 
Patients would no longer be alone 
in the struggle to adhere to a 
treatment plan and improve one’s 
health. Through a grassroots 
approach, non-profits serving 
the community would have an 
established 
relationship 
with 
health practitioners. In turn, 
this relationship would enable 
non-profits like Fresh Express 
to communicate when patients 
reach out to them for support and 
see if their resources are enough 
to help the patient.
Perhaps you are convinced 
this is the responsibility of social 
workers; however, not all primary 
care clinics are equipped to hire 
a full-time social worker. There 
is no reason that social needs 
and medical concerns cannot 
be integrated into the same 
treatment plan.

We need to fortify our sexual assault education
I 

am 
no 
stranger 
to 
sexual 
harassment. 
My 
developing 
years 
were 
littered with various types of 
these experiences. 
The first kiss I had 
was with a drunk 
actor my family 
had adored, I was 
a victim of a game 
that involved the 
groping of middle 
school girls and 
I 
had 
playdates 
where boys would 
tie me down and 
touch me. As a 
result, 
from 
a 
young age, I came to understand 
how detrimental the lack of 
education about sexual assault 
could be.
As a survivor, I’ve noticed 
in the past several weeks how 
cautious and aware students 
are of specific acts of sexual 
harassment or assault. There 
is an elemental idea of what 
sexual assault is and how to 
prevent it on campus, such as 
making sure to travel in groups 
and to not take drinks that you 
have not poured yourself.
However, the biggest issue 
plaguing the freshmen class 
is the overall atmosphere of 
indifference. After a night out, 
I have heard several female 
students talk about how they 
were groped or forced to dance 
in a sexualized manner at a 
party and didn’t think twice 
about it. It made me realize that 
we associate college with sexual 
harassment by default. Our 
new experience of secondary 
education comes hand-in-hand 
with adverse risks. 
In 
our 
current 
political 
atmosphere, 
the 
prevalence 
of conversations about sexual 
assault, harassment and rape 
has 
desensitized 
students 
toward the issue. While I 
am not stating that ongoing 
conversations have a negative 
effect on how we deal with 
sexual assault, the persistent 
use of it in media has made it 
seem hackneyed. It is no longer 
shocking 
to 
many 
students 
in terms of cases of college 
assaults, which is probably 
what is most disheartening. 
Consequently, 
this 
creates 
apathy 
towards 
victims 
of 
sexual 
assault, 
which 
can 
translate to a lack of urgency 
in the effort to rectify society’s 
perception of sexual assault as a 
“norm.”
It is crucial to clarify the 
term sexual assault before 
discussing 
the 
underlying 
issues behind it. The nonprofit 
organization 
Rape, 
Abuse 
& Incest National Network 
defines it as “sexual contact 
or 
behavior 
that 
occurs 
without explicit consent of 
the 
victim.” 
Consequently, 
anything from an unwanted 
touch 
to 
penetration 
falls 
under the umbrella of sexual 
assault. However, it seems as 
if in college, when we think of 
sexual assault we automatically 
think of rape. Sexual assault 
takes numerous forms and no 

one should feel the need to 
dismiss their story, regardless 
of where it is on the spectrum. 
There is also a stigma around 
who predators can be. 
When 
conversations 
of 
rapists 
and 
attackers arise, people 
automatically turn to 
extreme 
instances. 
Rapists 
such 
as 
Brock 
Turner 
and 
Ted Bundy are the 
archetypes 
people 
believe to be predators, 
which 
creates 
a 
one-dimensional 
perception. It creates 
the idea that a predator is an 
abstract 
monster, 
because 
no 
one 
they 
know 
could 
potentially 
harm 
someone 
else. It makes rapists and 
assaulters 
a 
borderline 
intangible characters, when, 
in reality, anyone who violates 
the rules of consent by failing 
to 
receive 
an 
enthusiastic 
“yes” or “no” from a person in 
a sober mindset can become 

a 
predator. 
According 
to 
Planned Parenthood, consent 
is composed of the factors that 
it is freely given, informed, 
enthusiastic, 
specific 
and 
reversible. It is integral to note 
that someone can give consent 
but then change their mind, 
and the other party needs 
to respect that. The more 
we 
remove 
ourselves 
from 
the idea that we could hurt 
someone else, regardless of our 
intention, the more we create a 
bigger risk for ambiguity and 
harmful relationships. 
While I acknowledge that 
there is no simple solution 
to the shallow mindset of 
the forms of sexual assault, 
and how it occurs, there are 
still steps the University and 
students can take to promote 
healthy relationships. I must 
note that the University does 
take actions to address this 
concept through Relationship 
Remix, a two-hour discussion 
all freshmen are required to 
take a month into their first 
semester. The session consists 
of discussion over personal 
values, identity, how to identify 
consent and proper use of 
contraception. And while it 
is a very comprehensive and 
thoughtful session, there needs 
to be further incentive for 
students to take the course to 
heart rather than with a grain 
of salt. Such as approaching 
these 
programs 
seriously, 
rather than advertising it like 
a bullet point to check off the 

school year checklist. 
This is a pressing issue that 
needs to be addressed in the 
community because, while 
many 
misconceptions 
may 
exist about sexual assault, 
many students have personal 
experience, either of their 
own or someone close to 
them, which can make it a 
difficult topic to tackle. In 
fact, Making Caring Common, 
a report lead by the Harvard 
Graduate School of Education, 
revealed in a national survey 
that 87 percent of 18 to 25 year 
old women reported they had 
been a victim of at least one 
form of sexual harassment. 
While it may seem futile 
to discuss basic ideas such 
as consent and definitions of 
assault, these changes could 
be incredibly useful to a wide 
variety of students. Due to 
the large student population 
at the University, there is 
a plethora of diversity in 
regard 
to 
socio-economic 
backgrounds, ethnicity, race, 
nationality and sexuality. It 
is dangerous to assume that 
every student holds the same 
definition of sexual assault 
and understanding of consent. 
Unifying the student body 
on a baseline of the same 
definitions of assault, safe 
relationships 
and 
consent 
during their first year of 
college will create student 
accountability. 
Preventative actions would 
rectify a blurry understanding 
of the various forms of sexual 
assault and, while it may not 
solve the issue of sexual assault 
altogether, it is a giant step 
toward a safer community. The 
Washington Post published 
an article stating the major 
cause of sexual assault is 
not alcohol abuse, but rather 
the aggressors. They argue 
that a major combatant to 
sexual assault is to implement 
education 
programs 
that 
teach bystander intervention, 
healthy masculinity, how to 
set boundaries and how to 
protect oneself from attacks. 
Education 
of 
bystander 
intervention and definition of 
consent was also mentioned 
in the Huffington Post as 
mediums 
to 
combat 
the 
numerous mishandled college 
sexual assault cases. 
The education we receive 
now is the most recent lesson 
we will be taught as we go 
on with our lives. We are in a 
special position where this is 
likely the last time we will be 
sat down and prepared to build 
healthy relationships in order 
to avoid sexual assault, rape 
and harassment. 
Lastly, if you know anyone 
that is struggling with sexual 
violence in any form, please 
call 800-656-HOPE (4673) to 
be connected with a trained 
staff member from a sexual 
assault service provider in your 
area.

“Jexi” is a “what if” movie, that sad brand of 
stale comedy that’s framed by a conceptually 
intriguing idea — like “Isn’t It Romantic,” which 
asked what if someone was stuck in a romantic 
comedy? With major studio comedies frequently 
tanking at the box office, this type of writing 
has become increasingly popular as producers 
search for a unique idea to get people into theater 
seats. This time, unfortunately, that didn’t work. 
In its opening weekend, “Jexi” grossed a meager 
3.2 million dollars. For the benefit of those who 
didn’t see it (meaning most of the world) the 
film’s “what if” question is what if a cell phone fell 
in love?
Phil, played by Adam Devine (“Isn’t It 
Romantic”), works an unsatisfying job at a 
Buzzfeed-style website making listicles about 
cats while pining for something more. When 
he buys a new phone, its unusually vivacious 
artificial intelligence software, Jexi, sets out to 
improve his life, and falls head over heels for him 
in the process. Of course, these feelings aren’t 
quite reciprocated, as Phil has fallen in love with 
Cate (Alexandra Shipp, “Love Simon) and starts 
to use his phone less.
Devine and the cast, especially Wanda Sykes 
(“Bad Moms”), are funny enough to carry 
mediocre scenes that have been done before in 
countless other comedies. The science fiction 
elements, centered around a sentient, emotional 
AI, are interesting at a base level, asking common 
but still pressing questions about artificial life 
and the future of human connection. Jexi herself 
is also hilarious, delivering expletive-filled 
rants with the dryness of a taciturn artificial 
personality like Siri. The movie is a strange 
combination of science fiction with a social 
point a la “Black Mirror” and a Lifetime network 
romantic comedy.
The two genres in “Jexi” mix like oil and 
water. The science fiction is kept a wall away 
from the love story, shoved into a subplot. The 
film employs elements from two distinct genres 

with widely different rules and conventions, 
without considering how they would appear in 
juxtaposition. Since a balance is never achieved, 
they manage to diminish the effects of each other. 
Imagine going from a meditation on life with AI 
to a showy dance montage — it’s jarring. The 
romance comes off as frivolous and unrealistic, 
while the sci-fi appears impersonal, just a 
gimmick in service of the plot.
On top of the blithe romance and its science 
fiction sojurns, “Jexi” clumsily tries to say 
something about society. It’s a basic message: 
Technology 
dependence 
bad, 
personal 
connection good. The opening scene is a montage 
of Phil diving into a cell phone to escape his 
parents’ troubled marriage. Then there’s Adam 
painstakingly working to create the “perfect” 
Facebook picture, slathering it in filters and 
emojis. Finally, and most ham-fistedly — a phone 
literally tries to stop Phil from having a human 
relationship. 
This idea would work if “Jexi” had any real 
humanity, yet everything about it invokes 
the superficiality of the internet age. The 
cinematography chokes in colors straight out of 
Snapchat’s most garish filters, and the music used 
wouldn’t be out of place in an Apple commercial. 
The characters are like Instagram personalities, 
too. They fit their assigned roles perfectly, 
without any blemishes, and there is never any real 
depth. Kid Cudi’s awkward cameo furthers the 
unreality.
“Jexi” dispenses surface pleasures perfectly, 
conjuring brief laughs or mild interest, but in the 
end, nothing sticks. Its many disparate parts are 
too underdeveloped and contradictory to work. 
Satires about similar topics, like the episode 
“Nosedive” from “Black Mirror,” work because 
the comedy and science fiction are intertwined, 
combining to say something meaningful about the 
human experience. In “Jexi,” they’re too chopped 
up, which keeps it from saying anything at all.
“Jexi” will be buried in the streaming sludge 
among other forgotten movies, joining the ever-
growing pile of colorful, smiling thumbnails that 
don’t do much but look pretty. This seems like the 
most appropriate fate.

The band is Never Ending Game. The album 
is Just Another Day. The following are real 
reactions to the music found on the internet: 
“Music created by sentient neck tattoos,” “You 
must listen and punch at least three of your 
friends in the face,” “Definitely never wearing 
a shirt at a show again after listening to this 
one time” and the especially poignant, “Never 
Ending Game FUCKS.”
If such pleasantries don’t make you want to 
listen to this album, I’d like to offer my sincere 
apologies, but your tastes are out of whack. 
Never Ending Game, otherwise known as NEG, 
is composed of the former members of the bands 
Freedom, True Love, Detain and Breaking 
Wheel, a few of Detroit’s finest hardcore bands. 
In plain terms, the band has some serious 
pedigree. NEG’s brand of hardcore is for the 
purists: Anyone who wants it, as long as they can 
deal with the band’s sawed-off-shotgun energy. 
They do what they do, and someone doesn’t like 
it — well, too bad, they’re going to keep doing 
it. NEG crafts brooding, methodical, groovy, 
riffy, bass-heavy hardcore with lyrics filled with 
venom and cynicism, and on Just Another Day, 
they push the limits of that sound.
Lead single “God Forgives…” aptly prepares 
listeners for the band’s current mission. Looping 
guitar chugs and drum snaps provide a just 
backdrop to lyrics like, “Don’t crawl back / 
What we possess is what you lack.” NEG posits 
themselves as a band that has transcended the 
scene. They’re setting the pace for all other 
hardcore bands. In one of the best calls of the 
year, a robotic sample drops an ominous “God 
forgives…” and vocalist Mikey barks a fear-
inducing “N-E-G don’t” in response. It could not 
be more perfect. The band makes it clear that no 
one can mimic their sound, and if they try, they 
will be sorry.
The first four tracks are an unforgiving 
onslaught of NEG’s best material, but then 

something strange happens. The brutality 
lets up, but just for a moment. A minute and 41 
seconds, to be exact. On “N.E.G. Jams,” the band 
breaks down into a groovy garage metal set, free 
of vocals. It’s not much, but it sure is a hell of a lot 
of fun — the perfect way to break up the violence.
Much of the same happens for the rest of 
the album, but that’s not a bad thing. Rather, 
it’s a testament to NEG’s consistency and their 
mastery of craft. Late album highlights include 
“Bleeding,” a storm-siren track littered with 
quotable lines and gang vocals, and “Stolen 
Life,” a winding, haunting (almost medieval) 
track with lyrics like, “I learned at an early age / 
Life can’t be given back, only taken away … Only 
the faces change, it all stays the same.” The song 
in which Never Ending Game is at their best, 
however, is album closer “1 of Those Nights.”
“1 of Those Nights” finds NEG at their best, 
their most dynamic and their most earnest. On 
this track, the band metamorphosizes into a 
metal act á la Power Trip or Gatecreeper while 
still maintaining their hardcore roots. NEG 
isn’t trying to pummel listeners with this one. 
Instead, they’re trying to teach listeners a lesson 
in getting through hard times. Downtrodden 
early lines like “Every night, I close my eyes / I’ll 
give this life one more try / The tears I’ve cried 
have left me blind” are contrasted by later lines 
like “You brought me to the light / With you, I’ll 
make it through the night / Wish I had the words 
to thank you for opening my eyes.” It’s powerful, 
and especially given the hardcore delivery of the 
message, the record may well be the band’s best 
work.
Never Ending Game is obviously a good hardcore 
band, but their quirks are what make them great. 
They’re much more nuanced than many of their 
contemporaries, and Just Another Day does 
an excellent job proving that. They wear their 
influences on their sleeves, but it’s not just their 
influences within the genre. The soul samples and 
the movie samples demonstrate NEG’s ability to 
pull inspiration from other media and warp it to fit 
their needs in fresh, exciting ways. If Never Ending 
Game can keep up with the pace they set on Just 
Another Day, we may be talking about them in the 

God forgives, but not NEG

FILM REVIEW

In many ways, Netflix’s “Living with Yourself” 
is your standard sitcom — Miles Eliot (Paul Rudd, 
“Avengers: Endgame”) is in his late thirties, his 
marriage and career tread water as he faces 
the impending reality of middle age. The only 
difference is that while others attempt to learn 
how to play an instrument or buy a new car, Miles 
attempts to escape his familiar lifestyle by cloning 
himself. In all fairness, this was not his goal. Miles 
learns from his co-worker Dan (Desmin Borges, 
“You’re the Worst”) about an extremely exclusive 
spa that gives their clients a DNA detox in order 
to let them live life to their fullest potential. 
Desperate enough to pay the $50,000 fee, Miles 
lies down in the treatment chair and wakes up as 
a new man — one with a rejuvenated sense of life. 
He sticks his out of the car window like a dog, 
outshines Dan at the office and cooks meals for his 
wife Kate (Aisling Bea, “This Way Up”). The only 
problem is that original Miles wakes up in a body 
bag in a forest and isn’t too fond of this new Miles, 
who is literally a better version of himself, taking 
over his life.
Based on the first few episodes, the show mostly 
alternates between the perspectives of the original 
Miles and his clone. At its worst, it can get repetitive 
and confusing. At its best, this show demonstrates 
Rudd’s ability as an actor to simultaneously play a 
worn-out pinhead and a charismatic maniac. Every 

episode thus far has ended in a cliffhanger. But the 
source of most of the drama comes from its (sort 
of confusing) narrative structure as the episodes 
begin by rewinding the cliffhanger sequence and 
playing it from the other Miles perspective. 
In some ways, Timothy Greenberg’s “Living 
with Yourself” is like Michael Schur’s “The 
Good Place,” both utilizing fantastical premises 
to explore the potential for self-improvement. 
Although “Living with Yourself” is less magical, 
it too uses absurdist humor to break up awkward 
situations. Contrasted with “The Good Place”, 
where there is an explanation for everything, 
Greenberg doesn’t seem too concerned in the 
science or rules surrounding the premise. This is 
problematic as there is minimal explanation for 
how Top Happy Spa operates — they create a clone 
with genetic improvement and transfer memories 
of the original client who is normally killed in the 
process. Additionally, the rules feel inconsistent: 
New Miles knows everything that original Miles 
has learned but feels none of the frustration from 
Kate’s failed pregnancy. It’s extremely unclear as 
to why refreshing one’s DNA would rid Miles of 
past disappointments that led him to make the 
decision to become cloned to begin with.
“Living with Yourself” feels simultaneously 
original, yet tired. It combines standard sitcom 
tropes 
coupled 
with 
technological 
anxiety, 
grounded with the talented Paul Rudd. If you are a 
fan of Rudd, that is enough reason to watch. Aside 
from that, the eight-episode season makes it a 
minimal commitment.

My introduction into the world of highlife 
music came incidentally through my love 
of the distinctive, jangly sound of Johnny 
Marr’s Rickenbacker 330. You can often see 
the associations online, even though Marr 
himself says he never himself was really aware 
of the genre when he started experimenting 
with his signature tone. Nonetheless, the 
obvious comparisons still persist, providing an 
introduction to the diverse, political genre.
It’s difficult to pin down the precise origins 
through the multitudes of sub-genres, but 
most sources seem to agree that highlife began 
in Ghana in the early 1900s as a mix of local 
Ghanaian musical traditions with European 
instrumentation and a distinct jazz influence, 
which itself at the time was reaching its peak 
popularity. The term itself came from the 
idea at the time that, going to certain clubs 
and other establishments to listen to bands 
playing this type of music was indeed “living 
the highlife.” 
Listening to renditions of classics of the 
early highlife era such as Jacob Sam’s “Yaa 
Amponsah,” one can hear the influences on 
Anglophone works that would appear several 
decades later, from Paul Simon to The Talking 
Heads. Highlife itself takes most of its rhythms 
and structures from the folk music of the Akan 
people, the predominant ethnic group in the 
Gold Coast area of West Africa. Musicians who 
were familiar with traditional instruments 
such as the seperewa, a harp-lute transitioned 
easily to guitars, a representation of this 
type of synthesis of new instrumentation and 

traditional motifs. 
During the postwar period, and especially 
during the time when Ghana gained its 
independence from England, highlife became 
not only the country’s most popular form of 
music, but also a symbol of national unity and 
a mode of celebration, even though the genre 
in its early stages heavily catered towards 
the wealthy and colonial elite in the urban 
centers of the country. Even Louis Armstrong 
came to Ghana to perform alongside the “King 
of Highlife” E.T. Mensah and his band The 
Tempos. 
During the 1940s and ’50s, the genre spread 
from its origins in the coast of Ghana into 
neighboring countries, becoming especially 
popular in Nigeria. Fela Kuti, arguably the 
most famous Nigerian musician ever, was 
heavily influenced by highlife when creating 
the style of music he dubbed “Afrobeat.” In 
both countries, the genre consumed influences 
from funk and reggae as well, yet again 
blending new elements.
Some of the genre’s best tracks came out 
of this period of popularity in Nigeria in the 
1960s and ’70s, a time when the genre declined 
in popularity (albeit with a short revival) in 
Ghana, including Celestine Ukwu’s sunny 
“Ejina Uwa Nya Isi.” Even until the 1980s, 
classics such as “Osondi Owendi” were being 
released by artists such as Stephen Osita 
Osadebe, who aimed to further “Africanize” 
the genre rather than take most of its influences 
from external forms such as jazz. 
Highlife is a difficult genre to precisely 
define since it resists all such attempts. Yet its 
influence has been felt far and wide, and has 
lent itself to both political and nonpolitical 
movements.

At Bear Creek Studios last summer, just outside 
Seattle, the indie band Big Thief hit a point of contention. 
In their secluded, wooden cabin studio, they realized 
they had over two albums worth of music to record. 
Lead singer and prolific writer, Adrianne Lenker, had 
created over 50 songs in the two years since releasing 
their sophomore album, Capacity. Only five days after 
recording their third album U.F.O.F, Big Thief hunkered 
down to record the follow-up Two Hands. 
Big Thief physically linked the two albums together 
from the beginning; when fans purchased U.F.O.F. on 
vinyl in July 2019, they noticed blank 7” records in their 
purchase, with the unreleased single “Two Hands.” 
Little did fans know, this subtle gesture hinted at the 
connectedness to a companion album that was on its 
way. Now, we finally have both — Big Thief’s golden age 
is in full bloom. 
Two Hands is a down-to-earth album that investigates 
the nature of bodies and of the earth, illuminating 
brothers, lovers and the planet as a collective body. 
Where U.F.O.F escapes towards out-of-body experiences 
(with production that matches the drum of a spiritual 
ethos), Two Hands roots itself in the body, launching 
into uncharted territory in its practical yet questioning 
encasement of the human experience. Still, the temporal 
closeness of both records’ creation shows: Lenker’s 
autobiographical moments and use of characters peels 
back layers, which is paired with an extreme willingness 
to be vulnerable. This is Big Thief’s sweet spot. 
Two Hands interrogates the social follies we’re all 
responsible for, while remaining in touching distance to 
the beautiful glow of our bodies and earth. The record 
does the same sonically: Lenker’s voice has a delicate 
desperation that cries out as if for justice, but the 
fingerpicking and chord progression always pulls her 
back into a swing. All the while, the use of descending 
chord progressions in Two Hands lowers listeners down 
to the soil. 
Lead single “Forgotten Eyes” is emblematic of 
what Big Thief does thematically throughout the 
album. “Forgotten Eyes” dives into climate change, 
homelessness and violence, taking these social issues and 
situating them in a singular identity. The lyrics position 
“them” next to “I,” creating a sort of accountability 
with the lyrics “And the poison is killing them, but then 
so am I.” In these lines, Lenker’s voice breaks, but is 
saved by the chorus, a rush of soothing chords, as the 
listener is settled into the grounded, fruitful message: 
“Everybody needs a home and deserves protection.” 
Desperate breakaways in vocals followed by humming 
instrumentation might be the best way to describe 
the genius of Two Hands, both sonically and lyrically. 
Lenker’s voice breaks and shreds, allowing her to 

delicately stray for emphasis, until the chord progression 
and more symmetric fingerpicking brings the listener 
back under her protection, weaving a soothing cocoon 
that pulls her breaking voice back in. The album is quiet 
at the right times, building gently to Lenker’s piercing 
moments. 
The title track “Two Hands” emphasizes the earthen 
nature of this record. Lenker is in her upper register, 
complemented with guitar sequences that emulate birds 
chirping — it has a Snow White quality. She goes from 
a Disney princess singing to the birds, earthly in every 
sense, to a musician of much harsher tones later in the 
record, specifically on the track “Not.” “Not” carries the 
most pent-up anger on the album, repeating the use of 
“not” or “nor” at the beginning of each line, then listing 
entities we touch, feel, taste, see and hear. Right after the 
aggression of the track “Not” we get “Wolves,” which 
brings us back to nature, using a consistent droning note 
and a complex rhythm on top, as if to catch the morning 
sun. Lenker’s “ooos” start to sound like the howl of a 
wolf.
My personal favorite on the record, “Shoulders,” 
reflects on violence in our own veins, with the fierce 
lyrics: “It’s me, it’s me, it’s in my veins.” Big Thief 
takes on large topics like violence and looks at them 
microscopically. For another example, “The Toy” haunts 
with a sound that coos, while its lyrics suggest the toy in 
her hand could be a gun. 
2019 is the year of Big Thief. Lenker draws in fans 
with an intense stare that kills, and a voice that murders. 
With Two Hands, Big Thief evolves their sound to be 
gentle yet powerful, melodic social commentary on our 
own bodies and the body of human beings collectively. 
Big Thief’s pair of 2019 albums emphasize the love of 
interconnection. This sort of locked-in, groundedness to 
each other and to the earth itself, as displayed on Two 
Hands, is best encompassed in the following quote from 
Lenker in an interview with Stereogum: 
“I think in the next 10 years, we’re probably going to 
find some way to protect some patch of the earth and 
maybe build a studio and have underprivileged children 
be able to come and make music … We want to create 
something that would help, not just donate money we get 
from tour to organizations but try and grow closer to the 
earth, closer to our own centers.” 
That’s what Two Hands does — it grounds us. It brings 
us closer to our own centers.

CLARA SCOTT
Senior Arts Editor

The idea of “gifted and talented” programs 
is nothing new: In fact, I would expect many of 
the people at the University were a part of one in 
the past. It’s a good way to group students with 
exceptional promise together, and also a perfect 
opportunity to infuse school with a sense of 
bizarre competitive edge early on. It’s this idea 
of gifted children, especially those who might be 
more gifted than the average child, that serves as 
the bedrock of Stephen King’s newest novel “The 
Institute,” an entertaining and wholeheartedly 
disturbing take on what happens when 
institutions take advantage of bright youngsters.
Looking at the title, it’s easy to make 
connections between the novel and several other 
stories of gifted children, most notably Charles 
Xavier’s school for mutants in the X-Men 
franchise. But King, as the master of thrillers he 
is, takes a slower, more deliberate approach to 
the premise, building suspense and terror with 
an expert hand. In fact, the book is so slow in the 
beginning that it’s not clear what the plot will 
actually be for the first forty pages or so, one of 
its only faults. For any other author, most readers 
wouldn’t have the stamina to continue through a 
slog of exposition like that of King’s description 
of protagonist Tim Jamieson. Despite this, the 
first few chapters of the novel are just interesting 
enough 
to 
maintain 
intrigue, 
expecting 
something to happen at every turn. The slow 
burn is typical of many King novels, but holds a 
special prescience in this narrative. In this way, 
King’s reputation as a writer precedes even the 
content of “The Institute,” but it’s a trust that is 
earned quickly as the novel revs up.
Jamieson, a cop with a broken past, finds 
himself inexplicably thrown into the rinky-dink 
goings-on of a small South Carolina town called 
DuPray. Every character the reader is introduced 
to seems like a stereotype, from the lovable 
sheriff to the town’s resident conspiracy nut. 
But somehow, in true King style, not even these 
tropes seem contrived. In the setting of DuPray, 
anything could happen and you’d brush it off 
as small-town antics. Although not clear at the 
beginning, this environment’s characteristics 
lend themselves to larger happenings, the close 
net of townspeople supporting each other 
through it all. This attention to detail is what 
makes a reader start to realize the brilliance of 
King’s work, and the fact that even he, the master 
of an entire genre, can improve with each book. 
Not many writers could spend so much time on a 
seemingly run-down Southern town and have it 
pay off, but he is always 12 steps ahead.
Although the beginning of “The Institute” 
is dedicated to DuPray, the vast majority of the 
novel is centered around its other protagonist, 
12-year-old genius Luke Ellis. Ellis is considering 
going to college before he even goes through 
puberty, and his unassuming but loving parents 
are all on board. They meet with the principal, 

figure out the money, and hesitantly wait to 
push their son, both brilliant and grounded in 
atypical fashion for a child prodigy, out into the 
big scary world. That is, until Luke is suddenly 
kidnapped and shipped under cover of night to 
the book’s eponymous Institute. This happens 
as quickly in King’s writing as it must have felt 
for the characters themselves, one day hemming 
and hawing over the cost of college tuition and 
the next in a completely different world. The 
Institute isn’t a place for young geniuses to go 
and be supported into their adult genius lives; no, 
it’s much more sinister than that. 
Despite Ellis’s status as one of the smartest 
preteens in existence, this is not the reason he’s 
taken from our world into that of the Institute. 
Instead, it’s the fact that he is slightly telekinetic 
(TK, as the other kids at the compound put it), 
that make him a perfect target for the forces 
behind his kidnapping. Though the premise may 
seem like that of a cheesy young adult novel, King 
manages to make their predicament urgent, 
and the situations the children find themselves 
navigating very, very adult. Inside the Institute, 
children both telekinetic and telepathic are put 
through a rigorous battery of tests and tortures, 
all under the guise of military service. They 
live in rooms that are perfect replicas of theirs 
at home, except without windows. They are 
served gourmet meals in a posh cafeteria, but 
the vending machines offer cigarettes and tiny 
minibar alcohol in addition to their usual wares. 
The children are given shots and plunged into 
ice-cold tanks. Clearly, this isn’t a normal school 
for gifted children. But it isn’t a prison, either — 
the real dread of the novel is the reader’s inability 
to tell where it falls in the middle. 
Children between the ages of eight and 
15 roam the concrete halls, being used for an 
unknown purpose to further an unknown cause. 
King’s portrayal of the Institute is subtle, but that 
subtlety is what makes it even more terrifying. 
There are clear antagonists, but their intentions 
are fuzzy, the morals of what they are doing hard 
to discern. All the reader knows is that the kids 
shouldn’t be there, with a low hum of suspense 
coloring every move they make. 
The novel is hefty, as King’s books typically 
are, but it plugs along at a pace that makes 
its density nearly effortless to navigate. You 
can tell that “The Institute” is one of over 50 
books in King’s catalog, because it seems like 
it was written by someone with nearly infinite 
wisdom and insight into his own ideas. Every 
question that needs to be answered is answered, 
eventually. Though it’s the questions that King 
chooses not to tie up that make the novel so 
intriguing. Reading the book’s nearly 600 pages 
seems like walking down a carefully laid path, 
with every stone in the perfect position to lead 
you to the next one. Nothing is revealed too early, 
or brought up too late.

The University’s Musical Theatre Department’s production of 
“Pirates of Penzance” can be categorized as a pleasant surprise. 
Full of intense choreography, immense vocal skill and colorful 
costumes, the production was brimming with excitement. 
The stage was alive with pirates, nervous generals and a slew 
of intelligent daughters. I wouldn’t have wanted to spend my 
Sunday afternoon anywhere besides Cornwall, England with this 
hodgepodge of characters.
“Pirates of Penzance,” with music by Arthur Sullivan and a 
libretto by W.S. Gilbert, has never been my favorite theatrical 
endeavor. In fact, most of Gilbert and Sullivan’s work is not my 
favorite — I find the work dated and overdone. When I heard 
that the Musical Theatre Department was doing it this year, I 
rolled my eyes. It’s marketability to University donors makes it a 
fiscally reasonable choice for University productions. However, 
artistically, its story doesn’t strike me as much of a theatrical 
challenge for the students involved. 
However, under the direction of The School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance’s faculty Vincent J. Cardinal, this version of “Pirates” 
was unlike anything I could have anticipated from the 18th 
century comic opera. Cardinal’s vision brought a newfound sense 
of liveliness and flare to the production. It was “Pirates,” but on 
steroids. 
The choreography by Cassie Abate contributed greatly to the 
high production quality of this opera. Abate used the number 
of talented dancers at her disposal to her advantage. For less 
experienced choreographers, the sheer amount of bodies on 
stage could be a recipe for disaster as it opens up opportunities 
for creating a cluttered and messy image. However, Abate’s 
detailed and intricate choreography work allowed for fabulously 
orchestrated movements between performers. There was 
constantly something to catch your eye, be it a flip, a kick or a tap 
dance (yes, a break-out tap dance number in “Pirates” — talk about 
surprises!). Thanks to Abate and her assistant choreographer 
Maya Alwan, SMTD senior and musical theatre major, the lack 
of an interesting story line was made up for by the incredible 
dancing.
There was not a single actor on stage who did not fully commit to 
their role. The talent of each performer proved why the University 

is known for its stellar Musical Theatre program. With a cast so 
incredibly talented, it is difficult to pick out performances that 
shine above the rest. However, the performances from SMTD 
senior musical theatre majors Commodore C. Primous III and 
Nina White are certainly worthy of note. 
Primous played Pirate King, a comedic villain of sorts, who 
ruled over the other pirates in the show. Primous had a physicality 
that many actors would kill for, not to mention his lively facial 
expressions and comedic timing. If someone had told me he played 
this role eight times a week on Broadway, I wouldn’t bat an eye. It 
seemed to be made for him. 
White was fiery as Ruth — an older woman who is abandoned 
by her love, Frederic. Similar to Primous, the playfulness White 
incorporated in her rendition of Ruth made for some great 
comedic bits. She proved to be a fantastic character actor and fully 
committed to her role as a 45-year-old nanny. 
If someone were to ask you to see an 18th century comedic opera, 
you might politely decline. However, sometimes expectations 
don’t coincide with reality. The University’s production of 
“Pirates of Penzance” was one full of delightfully good surprises. 
Get your tickets for the second weekend now, while you still have 
the chance.

‘The Pirates of Penzance’ prevails

newfound sense of liveliness

ALEXIS RANKIN & ALEXANDRIA POMPEI / DAILY DESIGN BY JACK SILBERMAN

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — It was all right 

there in Ronnie Bell’s hands.

The ball, hitting his jersey between the 

numbers as he leaned slightly forward. The game, 

a chance to erase a 21-point deficit and pave the 

way for overtime, rested there, too. The trajectory 

of a season — and maybe, just maybe, a chance to flip 

narratives and tilt the Michigan football program along its axis.

With just over two minutes left, facing a fourth-and-goal from the 

Penn State four-yard line, the hopes of a program handicapped by 

an inability to win games of this ilk, against opponents like this, in 

environments like these rested in Bell’s hands.

Then the ball hit the turf.

Penn State, buoyed by an early 21-0 lead and atmosphere unlike 

many in college sports, held on to beat Michigan, 28-21, as the 

Wolverines’ furious comeback came agonizingly short. 

“Ronnie’s a fierce competitor,” said senior quarterback Shea 

Patterson after the game. “He’s being pretty hard on himself right 

now. That definitely didn’t take away the fact that he made a ton of 

great plays to put us into that situation. So, we’re just going to move 

on.”

Amid the bevy of what-ifs, though, moving on won’t be easy. 

What if Michigan’s hadn’t gone and allowed 21 points on the 

Nittany Lions’ first five drives, threatening to get swept away in 

the sea of white inside Beaver Stadium?

What if the Wolverines’ offense had capitalized on 

opportunities inside Penn State territory, instead of 

reflecting on four drives in opposing territory that ended 

scoreless?

What if those 50/50 plays — including multiple offensive 

pass interference calls and non-calls — turn in their favor?

What if that ball stays in Ronnie Bell’s hands?

“Of course it’s frustrating,” said junior center Cesar 

Ruiz. “Like I said before, you can’t harp on situations like 

that. You’ve got to just keep executing, keep doing what 

you’ve got to do.

“… We were in those situations a couple times (and) 

didn’t come up with a touchdown or any points. But, you 

know, it’s onto the next drive.”

Added sophomore linebacker Cam McGrone: “We gave 

up some key explosive plays in the beginning, and it came 

back to hurt us. Like a game like this, with a team as good as 

this, we can’t allow any explosive plays. We did that.”

Statistically, Michigan will reflect on the box score and 

feel it was the superior team. It outgained Penn State, 417-

283; nearly doubled the Nittany Lions on first downs, 26-14; 

had close to 15 minutes greater time of possession; converted 

on third down at a higher rate, 41 percent to Penn State’s 30 

percent.

Throughout most of the game, in the shadow of a seemingly-

insurmountable deficit, though, it hardly felt that way.

“Yeah, it didn’t (go off the rails early), but our guys play 

with great effort and great character,” said Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh. “… Made adjustments at halftime. They were good and I 

felt like our guys were not nervous. They were playing and executing. It 

felt like, just keep going and get this game won. 

“That was our belief.”

Harbaugh came out of the halftime exuding that belief. Staring down a 

14-point deficit and an eighth loss against ranked opponents on the road in nine 

attempts, Harbaugh told ESPN: “This will be our finest hour.”

With just over six minutes, Patterson and the Michigan offense had a chance 

to prove those words prophetic. They marched methodically inside the Penn State 

10-yard line, the fans increasingly hushed, tension mounting. It all came down to a fourth-

and-goal from the four-yard line, when Patterson found Bell flashing toward him. The ball 

hit the turf, and the ramifications soon came into focus.

The Wolverines are now 1-8 on the road against ranked opponents in the Harbaugh era. They 

are a middling 16-12 on the road in that span. With two Big Ten losses, their season, as they once 

envisioned it, is ostensibly over, if still not mathematically so.

When the clock ticked to an end, the final grain of sand falling through that hourglass, Harbaugh walked 

off the field with the rest of the team back into an all-too-familiar locker room setting. 

His finest hour, once again, must wait.

2B — October 21, 2019

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

M

ichigan played its 
best football game of 
the season Saturday. 
Michigan also 
lost, notching 
a second Big 
Ten defeat, 
which equates 
to something 
of a death 
knell in mod-
ern college 
football.
It’s diffi-
cult to square 
these two dis-
tinct facts, so I won’t try to do so. 
There are surely hot takes to be 
read, and this won’t be one. Josh 
Gattis’ offense looked better, 
particularly in the second half. 
Shea Patterson offered his best 
performance of the season. After 
an early speed bump, the Wol-
verines’ defense settled in quite 
comfortably. The talent of this 
team is present — and, at times, 
quite obvious.
Michigan outgained Penn 
State, 417 to 283, and could have 
easily posted 35-plus points 
had it capitalized on five drives 
inside Nittany Lions territory 
that resulted in zero points. It’s 
a game the Wolverines probably 
should have won. Where have we 
heard that before?
This column obviously takes 
on a whole different tenor if 
Ronnie Bell catches that pass in 
the end zone, if a couple 50/50 
calls go Michigan’s way, if Pat-
terson doesn’t errantly throw an 
interception on the screen pass in 
the second quarter, if—we could 
entertain these equivocations 
all day.
All that’s left to say — after 
a game which will mark Jim 
Harbaugh’s seventh loss to a 
ranked opponent on the road in 
eight tries and his eighth loss in 
eight games as an underdog — is 
that there are no more moral 

victories. This is Year Five. Half 
a decade into what should have 
been a golden age of Michigan 
football, the 
Wolverines will 
have not a thing 
to show for it. 
This program is 
not what it thinks 
it is, plain and 
simple.
The second 
half against Penn 
State showed 
glimpses of what 
this team could 
be if it ever reached its apex. Pat-
terson was in a groove, dealing to 

his trove of weapons. The offense 
had tempo and purpose, wearing 
down a Nittany Lions defense 
that entered the 
game top-10 in 
SP+ defense. The 
defense was as 
aggressive and 
imposing as it 
perceives itself. 
It was at once a 
glimmer of hope, 
and a cruel twist 
of the knife — the 
full comeback 
ending mere 
yards shy, No. 7 Penn State escap-
ing with a 28-21 win.

The performance in the sec-
ond half Saturday, one of the best 
halves of football this team has 
played in years, 
changes noth-
ing. Just because 
Harbaugh’s team 
surpassed the 
menial expecta-
tions it set for 
itself through 
the first six 
games does not 
excuse another 
in a remarkably 
consistent line of 
disappointments. 
“I’m not gonna sit down and 

feel sorry for ourselves,” said 
junior defensive end Kwity 
Paye. “We still have a lot of big 
teams to play — 
we have Notre 
Dame, a ranked 
team, Ohio State, 
a ranked team. 
There’s still plen-
ty of opportunity 
to be able to go 
out and finish the 
season great.”
You’d expect 
a player of Paye’s 
maturity to 
say that, of course, and it’s not 
entirely untrue. This team could 

quite possibly run the table to 
Ohio State; it opened as a slight 
favorite over No. 8 Notre Dame 
next weekend, and will almost 
certainly be favored against 
Michigan State, Indiana and 
Maryland. Winning those and 
then capping the year with a 
win over the Buckeyes would 
constitute some sort of success-
ful season, if unconventional and 
still hollow.
“Just complimented them on 
the effort they gave, the char-
acter they showed,” Harbaugh 
said, on what he told his team 
after the game. “Hold their heads 
high and come back at it again on 
Monday.”
Added senior VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson: “We’ve just got to move 
onto the next day. We’ve got to 
work even harder in practice and 
we’ve just got to stay on top of 
our film work and keep trusting 
our guys.”
It’s tiresome to hear, and 
must be more tiresome to live. 
There are still meaningful 
prisms through which to view 
the rest of the season. Increased 
opportunities for promis-
ing young players — the Cam 
McGrones, Zach Charbonnets, 
Daxton Hills, Chris Hintons 
scattered about the roster — 
will help enlighten present and 
future talent. Wins over Michi-
gan State (a requirement) and 
Ohio State (a bonus) would cer-
tainly do wonders to quell the 
angst in and around the team. A 
bowl win for the first time since 
2015 would mean something, to 
be sure.
But there are no more moral 
victories left to deduce any-
more. All that counts are the 
literal ones. And in the biggest 
moments, those remain absent.

No more moral victories

When 
Western 
Michigan 
(9-4-0 overall, 1-0-0 MAC) 
visited the Michigan men’s 
soccer team (6-4-3 overall, 
2-1-2 Big Ten) 
last 
Thursday, 
the 
visitors 
looked to use 
a 
seemingly 
simple 
tactic— 
turn 
the 
beautiful game 
into something, 
well, 
less 
beautiful. Their 
attempts proved 
successful as the 
Broncos beat the Wolverines 
2-1.
“It wasn’t much of a soccer 
game, which made it a lot more 
difficult for us,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley.
A talented Western Michigan 
team, ranked 33rd in the country 
in the latest RPI poll, used 
physical play to its advantage 
to turn the game away from a 
chess match. Despite totaling 14 
fouls, the Broncos only earned 
one yellow card in the 14th 
minute.
Michigan looked frustrated 
trying to deal with Western 
Michigan’s 
energy 
while 
struggling to keep possession 
in the attacking half of the 
field and went into the half 
trailing 1-0. After a few more 
hard fouls in the second half, 

the frustration started to boil 
over, as Michigan exchanged 
frequently pleasantries with 
Broncos players.
Coach Daley did his best to 
cool his team down and refocus 
it on its own play.
“It’s tough, I 
think it should 
be sorted out by 
the 
officials,” 
Daley said. “But 
if it’s not, you 
have to make 
sure that you 
respond 
and 
continue to play 
and not get too 
distracted 
or 
emotional from 
it. I think our team got a little 
emotional as a result.”
Emotions reached a peak 
point after the final horn, the 
game ending in a 2-1 Western 
Michigan win. The Broncos 
performed a spirited rendition 
of their fight song in front of 
their supporters, to the great 
dismay of a few Michigan 
players who approached the 
opposing team with seemingly 
ill intent before being held back 
by teammates and coaches.
Theatrics 
aside, 
Western 
Michigan ultimately outplayed 
Michigan and could cruise 
back to Kalamazoo with an 
impressive win against the 
Wolverines. Undoubtedly the 
Wolverines will have their next 
bout with the Broncos circled 
on their calendars.

DOMINIC DIFRANCO
For The Daily

Once 
the 
outcome 
was 
decided, 
Western 
Michigan 
poured onto the field and sang 
their fight song at the top of 
their lungs. The fight song was 
appropriate in more than one 
way on Thursday. 
On a night where 20 fouls 
were committed, neither team 
pulled any punches both on 
and off the field. The Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 
team 
(6-4-3 
overall, 2-1-2 Big Ten) fell to 
2-1 to Western Michigan (9-4-1 
overall) . 
The Wolverines struggled 
in the first half against the 
Broncos’ high press, as the 
opposing side scored within 
the first minute. With senior 
forward Jack Hallahan out 
due to injury, the Wolverines 
lacked the creative spark to 
break down the opposition. 
Western 
Michigan’s 
tall 
back line cleared everything 
Michigan crossed into the box, 
making it difficult for its front 
line to get shots on target. The 
game got choppy by the end of 
the first half as the Broncos 
committed four fouls and had 
one yellow card, a preview of 
what was to come.
“We let a half pass us by,” 
said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. 
“We 
did 
ourselves 
a disservice by not being 
prepared for the energy they 
would bring. It wasn’t much of 
a soccer game which made it 
a lot more difficult for us, but 
we have to respond to those 
things.”
The 
Wolverines 
came 
out 
strong 
in 
the 
second 
half, scoring a 46th minute 
goal from graduate transfer 
Nebojsa Popovic. Freshman 
midfielder 
Harry 
Pithers 
played a one-touch pass high 
to the far end of the box to 
freshman forward Christian 
Pullselli, who headed it back 
to the center. Popovic met the 
ball and volleyed it home. 
“You need some personality 

players to break them down 
and we have three that weren’t 
available,” 
Daley 
said. 
“It 
makes it difficult and we knew 
it would be a challenge because 
we know those guys can unlock 
the game.”
Forty seconds later, Western 
Michigan responded with a 
high-shot goal at the top of 
Michigan’s six-yard box. Then, 
the Broncos shifted the tenor of 
the game, committing 10 fouls 
in the second half. Whether it 
was swinging for the man, not 
the ball, or throwing elbows 
while going up for a header, 
the message was clear from the 
Broncos.
“It’s tough,” Daley said. “I 
think it should be sorted out by 
the officials.”
Michigan followed Western 
Michigan’s 
goal 
with 
a 
great scoring chance in the 
51st minute. A low driven 
ball across the box came to 
Popovic, who shot it towards 
goal. But, Broncos goalie Isaac 
Walker came up with the save 
denying Michigan one of their 
best chances of the game.
“We’ve got to put it in the 
rear view mirror,” Daley said. 
“It’s a tough night for our 
group. We are disappointed we 
responded too late. We need to 
get back to the drawing board.”
Compared to Michigan’s six 
fouls, Western committed 14 
by the end of the match. The 
Broncos switched to a more 
compact formation and stuck 
five players in their back line to 
further stymie the Wolverines. 
This gave Michigan no choice 
but to move 6-foot-5 senior 
center back Jackson Ragen 
up top and bomb crosses into 
the box. Elbows were thrown, 
fingers were pointed and a 
rivalry brewed. 
“You 
have 
to 
respond, 
continue to play, and not get 
too emotional about it,” Daley 
said. I think our guys got a 
little bit too emotional. That’s 
a style or tactic for sure. We 
didn’t do a good job handling 
that.”

The Michigan football team played one of its best halves of football in years. But we’re past the point of moral victories.

Michigan offense stifled in physical matchup,
fight breaks out after ugly 2-1 loss to WMU

NICK MOEN

‘M’ rebounds with win 
over hapless Rutgers

The Michigan volleyball team 
had a fatigued Rutgers squad 
on the ropes late in the second 
set, desperately scrambling to 
patch 
together 
a 
sustained 
attack. Sensing 
a break in the 
Wolverine 
defense, 
the 
Scarlet Knights 
rallied, 
but 
freshman 
middle blocker 
May 
Pertofsky 
rushed to the 
ball, greeting it 
with an emphatic solo block. On 
the very next play, in the exact 
same spot, the Rutgers attack 
was stuffed again, this time by 
redshirt freshman outside hitter 
Grace Persson. 
The rest of the night played 
out in much the same way for 
the Wolverines (13-5 overall, 6-2 
Big Ten), who swept the Scarlet 
Knights (6-13, 0-8) to the tune 
of 25-10, 25-15, 25-16. Following 
consecutive Big Ten losses to 
No. 5 Nebraska and No. 8 Penn 
State, Michigan wasted no time 
righting the ship against another 
conference foe. 
“We knew Rutgers wasn’t as 
strong of an opponent, but for us, 
we always judge on our side of the 
net,” said Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen. “It’s about how are we 
playing comparative to our level 
rather than the opponent, and 
that’s probably one of the most 
dialed-in team wins, playing for 
each other.”
The Wolverines set the tone 
early with a swarming, physical 
defense that left few gaps on the 
court, frustrating the Scarlet 
Knight attack, which was unable 
to correct course even after 
burning two timeouts in the 
first set. Rutgers had no answers 
for the freshman tandem of 
Pertofsky and middle blocker 
Jess Robinson, who combined for 
25.5 points and 10 blocks. 
Michigan’s 
competence 

in both phases of the game 
continued during the match, as 
the Scarlet Knights scored on 
45.2 percent of their possessions 
when receiving the serve, while 
the Wolverines scored on a gaudy 
81.4 percent of theirs. Not a single 
Scarlet 
Knight 
reached double-
digit 
points, 
while Pertofsky, 
Robinson 
and 
sophomore 
outside 
hitter 
Paige Jones all 
tallied 
10 
or 
more. 
“I 
thought 
tonight we were 
just really clean,” 
Rosen said. “When you hit almost 
.500 and side out at 80 percent, 
you know, those are numbers that 
are crazy. (A hitting percentage 
of) .250 is a good number, and 
we were double that tonight. We 
were really efficient.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
efficiency 
was the product of a fluid, 
communicative attack befitting 
an 
older, 
more 
experienced 
group. Each player seemed to 
be innately aware of the other’s 
presence on the court, filling in 
the defensive gaps as necessary. 
“I 
think 
our 
team 
has 
gotten along really, really well, 
especially in the quickness in 
which we were put together,” 
Robinson said. “To pull off wins 
in a conference this hard, you 
have to be working together all 
the time.”
While 
Michigan’s 
pair 
of 
freshman flashed its two-way 
potential, 
the 
team 
should 
remain competitive within the 
conference by leveraging the 
talents of veterans like senior 
setter Mackenzi Welsh, who 
added two blocks and one of the 
team’s seven service aces.
“It’s not just our freshmen that 
are carrying the load right now,” 
Rosen said. “I think this team 
has a ton of potential to just keep 
getting better, and I’m pleased 
with the direction we’re heading 
in, but we’ve gotta win some of 
these big matchups.”

Close isn’t 
good enough 
for offense 
in loss

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Ronnie 
Bell stood in the middle of Penn 
State’s end zone, Shea Patterson’s 
pass floating toward his outstretched 
fingertips. A few yards away, Nick 
Eubanks started to raise his fists 
in celebration, because, somehow, 
Michigan’s season had a lifeblood.
The belief emanated for just long 
enough to make dreams seem tangible, 
something that felt impossible when 
Penn State led, 21-0, two quarters 
earlier.
Only, like it had been all game, 
fleeting hope turned out to be just 
that. Bell let the pass slip through his 
arms, Eubanks plastered his hands on 
his helmet in disbelief and 110,000 
white pom-poms rose to the air in 
unison.
“That definitely didn’t take away 
the fact that (Bell) made a ton of great 
plays to put us into that situation,” 
Patterson said. “So, we’re just going to 
move on.”
The issue is what Michigan moves 
on to. The Wolverines’ three biggest 
rivals remain on the docket, but the 
season and all the goals they carried 
into it are gone, a 28-21 loss putting 
the final nail on a coffin that’s been 
steadily nearing the grave for the past 
seven weeks.
On Saturday, for the first time in 
more than a month, it felt as if that 
course may be reversible. Michigan’s 
offense put together its most coherent 
performance of the season, behind 276 
passing yards from Patterson — the 
second-best total of his Wolverines’ 
career. “I thought the offense did a 
lot of really good things tonight,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh.
As a result, an offense that entered 
opposing territory nine total times in 
two previous games against ranked 
opponents did so eight times against 
the Nittany Lions. Yet, those lengthy 
drives too often ended without points. 
And, at the end, they had just 21 points 
and another loss to show for it.
“Of course it’s frustrating,” Ruiz 
said. “Like I said before, you can’t harp 
on situations like that. You’ve got to 
just keep executing, keep doing what 
you’ve got to do. That way, the next 
time you get in those situations you’ll 
score. We were in those situations 
a couple times (and) didn’t come up 
with a touchdown or any points. But, 
you know, it’s on to the next drive.”
To their credit, the Wolverines kept 
that mentality throughout.
When their first two trips across 
midfield ended in a third-and-1 stuff 
and a fourth-down incompletion, 
they came back three drives later and 
manufactured a eight-play, 75-yard 
drive to get on the scoreboard. A 
quarter later, they followed a punt 
from midfield with a run-heavy, 
65-yard touchdown march.
Still, as the final pass fell to the 
ground through Bell’s arms, it was 
hard to not reflect on an evening of 
missed opportunities.
The blame spreads from execution 
to decision-making. The execution 
part is obvious — Bell’s drop will 
forever be the game’s — and maybe 
the season’s — defining moment. As 
for his decision-making on two punts 
from midfield, Harbaugh said, “we 
were playing for field position and we 
wanted to get the ball — put it inside 
the 15- or 10-yard line.” Both times, 
Penn State took over possession 
outside the 20.
The most confounding decision, 
though, came with Michigan facing a 
fourth-and-6 from the Nittany Lions’ 
41 with 51 seconds left in a once-
disastrous first half that sat on the 
precipice of rescue. Despite senior 
kicker Quinn Nordin — normally 
the first choice for long field goals — 
being unavailable, Harbaugh pulled 
his offense off the field to go for three.
“Thought 
we 
could 
make 
it,” 
Harbaugh said. “Was right at that 
line where we could make it. And it’s 
a long field goal, but it was either that 
or go for it on the fourth down.”
The kick fell five yards short, 
finishing a third fruitless drive into 
Penn State territory and setting the 
course for the Wolverines’ second 
loss.
“It’s just onto the next one,” 
Patterson said. “We’ve got a big game 
next week.”
As he spoke, the stream of fans 
outside 
Michigan’s 
media 
room 
drowned him out with chants of “We 
are Penn State,” a fitting end to a day 
when talk doesn’t matter anymore.

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Jim 
Harbaugh’s hands were on his hips. 
His sweatshirt creased, the lines 
making their way around the back. He 
stood near the epicenter of a stadium 
that shook and swayed, singing 
and cheering in something nearing 
delirium, speaking with referees. He 
bore a look of exasperation and déjà vu.
The call on the field — that Penn 
State made the line to gain — was 
confirmed.
Minutes later, as 110,000-plus voices 
serenaded him and his Michigan 
football team in mocking unison, 
Harbaugh threw off his headset and 
started to walk towards midfield, a 
horde of cameras following. The clock 
ticked towards zero and in a game 
where the Wolverines had pulled their 
way back from the abyss encompassing 
the program all the way to fourth-and-
goal at the three-yard line, they lost 
anyway, 28-21, to the Nittany Lions.
“We’ve just got to move onto the 
next day,” said senior VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson. Next to him, Shea Patterson 
nodded silently, having been on the 
edge of tears for nearly all of a seven-
minute press conference. “We’ve got to 
work even harder in practice and we’ve 
just got to stay on top of our film work 
and keep trusting our guys.”
This is the kind of game Michigan 
has gained a reputation for losing 
spectacularly under Harbaugh, the 
hump he can’t seem to get over. 
The game’s first 30 minutes felt like 
a bad remake. The Wolverines wasted 
a timeout before the game’s first snap. 
They got conservative in their decision-
making on offense. They dropped 
passes and dropped an interception. 
With 10 minutes left in the second 
quarter and Penn State leading 14-0, 
Patterson, a senior quarterback, got 
picked off on a screen pass and the 
stadium breathed fire.

But this wasn’t another 35-14 
blowout at Wisconsin or another 62-39 
shellacking at the hands of Ohio State. 
This was a vulnerable Penn State and 
a Michigan that seemed to click into 
place as the game went along. Where 
the Wolverines seemed completely 
overmatched in those earlier contests, 
Saturday merely felt like a missed 
opportunity.
“Made adjustments at halftime. 
They were good and I felt like our guys 
were not nervous,” Harbaugh said. 
“They were playing and executing. It 
felt like, just keep going and get this 
game won. That was our belief.”
Harbaugh, mostly, fell back on the 
same platitudes that have become 
commonplace when he gets behind a 
microphone. At one point, he brought 
up the officiating — a borderline 
holding call on Lavert Hill that 
extended a Penn State drive at the start 
of the fourth quarter and cost Michigan 
a decisive seven points, among others.
It’s easy to look at that call on 
Hill and gripe. But when KJ Hamler 
burned Josh Metellus on a post for a 
53-yard score four plays later, it was 
— according to Harbaugh — because 
Michigan missed a signal, and didn’t 
have a safety covering the post as a 
result.
When Harbaugh got to Michigan 
in 2015, he garnered a reputation for 
being so precise and detail-oriented 
that even the student managers felt 
the heat, needing to tighten up. On 
Saturday, when they missed that call 
and Hamler waltzed into the end 
zone, Harbaugh paced up the sideline, 
staring into a sea of white and adjusting 
his headset.
This is the closest Michigan has 
come to winning a game like this — 
a game it wasn’t supposed to win, a 
game in which it was on the road as 
a touchdown underdog — since 2016, 
when Harbaugh still held all the 
promise of a savior.
Now, after the Wolverines’ second 

loss effectively ended their hopes of 
making the College Football Playoff, 
winning the Big Ten or even making 
the conference title game for the first 
time under Harbaugh, there is no 
surprise in this program’s identity. As 
close as it came to taking that elusive 
first step on Saturday, a tectonic shift 
has yet to happen. More and more, it 
seems like it might never.
For a moment in the fourth quarter, 
Michigan was right there on the cusp. 
The Wolverines held Penn State under 
100 yards in the second half. Their 
offense looked like something to be 
reckoned with — Patterson leading 
drives with authority, the Nittany 
Lions struggling to keep up with the 
tempo.
“I felt like we kinda found our 
groove a little bit,” Patterson said. 
“The run game got us in the game, our 
receivers made big plays in space.”
“We felt like we had them right in 
our hands,” said redshirt freshman 
linebacker Cam McGrone. “This is 
where we wanted them. We felt we 
could force them to do what we wanted 
to. We did.”
They got as far as the goal-line, with 
two downs to play with. Harbaugh’s 
hands were on his knees, his back 
hunched forward, when that number 
dwindled down to one. He said later 
that he wanted a fade in the corner of 
the end zone, but Penn State covered 
that up. 
Instead, Patterson hovered in the 
pocket. He saw Ronnie Bell in the 
center of the end zone, just past the 
goal line. As the football hit Bell’s 
hands, Harbaugh’s arms went up, a 
palpable expression of relief. As the 
ball hit the ground, his arms came 
back down. He ran up to Patterson and 
said something about getting the ball 
back. With two minutes left and three 
timeouts, possibilities remained.
In the end, though, it was just more 
of the same. For Harbaugh and for his 
program.

Sophomore wide receiver Ronnie Bell dropped a potential game-tying touchdown pass late in Michigan’s 28-21 loss to Penn State.

Penn State 
burns ‘M’ 
with big 
plays

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — The 
door opened and the noise from outside 
streamed in, fans lingering in the bowels 
of the stadium, still singing, “We are Penn 
State!”
Inside 
the 
visiting 
media 
room, 
Khaleke Hudson kept talking, his words 
juxtaposing the commotion outside. 
The senior VIPER spoke of Michigan’s 
defense, how it had given up too many 
big plays, how that was the difference in a 
28-21 loss to Penn State on Saturday night.
“It was nothing that they did,” Hudson 
said. “It was not that they outschemed us 
or anything, it was just our mistakes that 
we made ourselves. Things we knew how 
to do. We just messed up.”
The Wolverines committed a few too 
many penalties. They didn’t play through 
their hips enough. Occasionally, their eyes 
landed in the wrong place.
Little things, yes. But Saturday’s game, 
especially the first half, was a display of 
how easily little things can turn into big 
things.
Michigan 
outgained 
the 
Nittany 
Lions by almost 150 yards. It had more 
first downs and a better third-down 
conversion rate. And it handily won the 
time of possession battle, with its offense 
on the field for over 15 minutes longer 
than Penn State’s.
Stats like that usually add up to a win, 
but there’s a reason the Nittany Lions 
ran so many fewer plays and scored 
more points. They had six plays of over 
15 yards — including three of their four 
touchdowns — with three of those plays 
over 30 yards. Chunk plays only take up 
a few seconds. Meanwhile, intermittent 
offensive struggles, as the Wolverines had 
throughout the game, eat up clock.
“Big games like this, you can’t do 
anything wrong,” said redshirt freshman 
linebacker Cameron McGrone.
He was right. Michigan’s defense, for 
the most part, was very good Saturday. 
But it wasn’t perfect, and the big plays 
burned the Wolverines again and again.
McGrone’s theory was slightly different 
than Hudson’s, maintaining that, “it’s not 
that we did anything wrong, it was just, 
they outplayed us in that play.” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh had yet another 
explanation.

In the first half, he said, the Wolverines 
got burned on one particular play — the 
slot-fade route. That play worked to 
perfection on a 25-yard touchdown to 
star receiver KJ Hamler on third down in 
the second quarter. Michigan adjusted in 
the second half, but there, it was another 
mistake that cost it. Whether it was 
poor coaching, a lack of focus or being 
rattled by the raucous whiteout crowd, 
the Wolverines missed their defensive 
playcall.
With one minute left in the third 
quarter and the Nittany Lions on first 
down from Michigan’s 47, the Wolverines 
lined up in cover-zero, with senior safety 
Josh Metellus the lone player assigned to 
Hamler.
Hamler ran a post route straight past 
Metellus, caught Clifford’s pass in stride 
and motored into the end zone. The play 
put Penn State up by two scores and ended 
up being the deciding touchdown.
And while the play seemed to be on 
Metellus for his lack of speed, he shouldn’t 
have been in that position in the first 
place. According to Harbaugh, the players 
missed a hand signal that would have told 
them the correct formation to be in.
“Didn’t get a call in there, KJ on a 
safety, and it was a huge play,” Harbaugh 
said. “(We) didn’t have the right defense, 
and the play was a good call, so we didn’t 
have a post safety.”
So in the end, it didn’t matter that 
Michigan gained 417 yards to the Nittany 
Lions’ 283. It didn’t matter that the 
defense had a good showing the rest of 
the night, with five tackles for loss and six 
three-and-outs.
All it took were a few missed 
assignments that turned into big plays, 
and that was all Penn State needed to send 
its fans home singing along to Zombie 
Nation.
“This game was just down to who made 
the big plays,” McGrone said. “And you see 
who won.”

White Flag

Harbaugh gets close, but comes up short again in a big spot

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Shea 
Patterson stifled tears, his faded eye 
black running down a solemn face. 
Beneath the table where Patterson sat, 
stains from Beaver Stadium’s green 
grass covered his once-white uniform, 
the product of a day when he did 
everything he could for Michigan.
Criticized for not going through his 
reads, being too tentative to scramble 
and missing open receivers, Patterson 
excelled in those aspects in Saturday’s 
28-21 loss to Penn State, finishing with 
a season-high 276 yards on 24-of-41 
passing.
For the Wolverines, it’s the type of 
performance they envisioned when 
Patterson transferred from Ole Miss 
two years ago with the billing of a 
can’t-miss quarterback prospect who 
would get Jim Harbaugh over the 
hump. Twenty games later, that hump 
remains pervasive as Patterson enters 
the final stretch of his Michigan career 
with a 15-5 record, but void of the lofty 
goals he carried to Ann Arbor.
After Saturday night, that’s the 
juxtaposition Michigan has to live 

with.
“I was just proud of our guys and the 
defense held them to one touchdown in 
a real tight second half,” Patterson said. 
“I just love the way our offense fought 
back.”
Patterson, so often a microcosm of 
Michigan’s offense, stood at the center 
of that turnaround.
When the Wolverines went down 
21-0 midway through the second 
quarter, it was Patterson’s interception 
— his one glaring mistake all game — 
that put Penn State in prime position 
for its third touchdown. As Patterson 
walked off the field, he cast a familiarly 
frustrated figure, his right hand 
planted on his hip as Harbaugh gave 
him a condoling pat on the helmet.
Patterson seemed to be heading 
toward 
a 
similarly 
uninspired 
performance to his 14-of-32 showing 
against Wisconsin a month ago. Behind 
him, Michigan was on its own march 
to a repeat of that day in Madison, 
with the game seemingly over before 
halftime.
Only this time, it wasn’t.
“It didn’t (go off the rails early), 
but our guys play with great effort 
and great character,” Harbaugh said. 
“Yeah. Made adjustments at halftime. 

They were good and I felt like our guys 
were not nervous. They were playing 
and executing.”
On his first throw after the 
interception, Patterson found Nico 
Collins on a 30-yard gain, part of a 
season-high 89-yard game for Collins. 
Amid a season in which he’s drawn 
criticism for not targeting Collins, 
Donovan Peoples-Jones and Tarik 
Black, Patterson found the trio for 14 
completions on 22 tries Saturday. Seven 
plays after Collins took the Wolverines 
into Penn State territory, Michigan 
found paydirt for the first time.
“I thought the offense did a lot of 
really good things tonight,” Harbaugh 
said. 
“The 
offensive 
line, 
pass 
protection was really good. Thought 
Shea had a really good night throwing 
the football.”
The rest of the evening was more 
of the same for Patterson, who 
constructed seven drives into Penn 
State territory. The problem: only 
three ended in points, sending the 
Wolverines to a loss that ended every 
tangible goal they carried into the 
season.

This game was 
just down to 
who made the 
big plays.


Mel Pearson spent the week 
leading into the series against Lake 
Superior State stressing that his 
team needed to get out to an early 
lead.
The Lakers are a big, structured 
team and they are more than happy 
to sit back and defend if they get 
the lead early on. Michigan faced 
a similar style against Clarkson 
in the season-opening series, and 
the Golden Knights struck first 
both nights. Both nights, it allowed 
them to shut down the Wolverines’ 
chances the rest of the way and 
Clarkson came away with a tie and 
a win.
Friday 
night 
against 
Lake 
Superior, 
sophomore 
forward 
Nolan Moyle lit the lamp for 
Michigan just over five minutes 
into the game. And on Saturday, 
sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert did the same. This 
time, it took four minutes for the 
Wolverines to find twine, and they 
didn’t look back from there.
Michigan added two more goals 
in the opening period and one in 
the second to sweep Lake Superior 
State, 4-3.
“Great start, three-nothing off 
the get-go,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “Much, much better 
start (than last night).”
Halfway 
through 
the 
first 
period, after Lambert opened 
the scoring, junior forward Jack 
Becker scored his second goal of the 
weekend when he picked up a loose 
puck in the slot and backhanded 
it into the net behind goaltender 
Mareks Mitens.
And it didn’t take Becker long 
after that to get his second goal of 
the night and third on the season.
On the power play, a pass across 
the crease from freshman forward 
Johnny Beecher found Becker 
waiting on the other side of the net. 
After whiffing on his first attempt, 
Becker tapped the puck into the 
open net, and Mitens didn’t have a 
chance to make the save.
“The puck came across the 

crease really fast,” Becker said. 
“Beecher made a nice pass to me. I 
kind of just corralled the puck and 
then hit it out of the air. Trying to 
stick with it and it went in the net, 
so it felt good.”
After a back-and-forth start 
to the second period, the Lakers 
found twine on their first goal of 
the series when forward Hampus 
Eriksson poked a loose puck in the 
slot past sophomore goaltender 
Strauss Mann. And under a minute 
later, forward Louis Boudon made 
it a one-goal lead for Michigan as 
he cleaned up a rebound off a shot 
from defenseman Lukas Kaelble.
“I just don’t like when you get off 
to a great start like that and then 
you have that sag,” Pearson said. 
“You’re going to have moments in 
the game, but you have to make 
sure if one line has a tough shift, 
then the next line’s ready to go and 
get the momentum back.”
With all the momentum going 
toward the offensive zone for Lake 
Superior State, it seemed like the 
game would be tied before long. 
But a few shifts later, sophomore 
defenseman 
Jack 
Summers 
changed that.
At the 8:14 mark of the second 
period, shortly after Boudon’s goal, 
Summers beat Mitens high on his 

glove side to extend the Wolverines’ 
lead back to two.
“That was a huge goal,” Pearson 
said. “All the momentum was going 
the other way, and then Sums 
comes in and that’s a big, big goal. 
Good for him. He’s played well.”
To close the second stanza, 
freshman forward Eric Ciccolini 
was whistled for tripping, and the 
Lakers started the third period on 
the power play. Michigan got the 
kill, but three seconds after the 
power play ended, Kaelble fired a 
shot over Mann’s shoulder to bring 
the lead back to one. 
“I saw that third one, it was a 
heck of a shot and the guy made a 
good play,” Pearson said. “He’s a 
really good player.”
Chances came and went for 
both teams in the remainder of 
the period, but the score remained 
unchanged.
With just under two minutes left 
to play, Lake Superior State pulled 
Mitens for an extra attacker in an 
attempt to tie the game. A scramble 
in front of the net in the final 
seconds nearly gave the Lakers 
what they were looking for, but 
Michigan held off the attack.
In the end, the early lead 
Pearson preached all week made 
all the difference.

Last Saturday, you wouldn’t 
be able to find Jack Becker on 
the ice.
Instead, you would find him 
sitting on the fifth floor of Yost 
Ice Arena, in the press box, 
with the remaining players not 
dressed for the game against 
No. 10 Clarkson. 
He wasn’t injured. He wasn’t 
suspended. 
He 
just 
wasn’t 
what Michigan hockey coach 
Mel Pearson thought the team 
needed to win that game.
“You have to make tough 
decisions,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“We’ve got a lot of good players. 
He knows. 
“He knows.”
In response, Becker upped 
his effort, his physicality, his 
game — both the little things 
and the obvious — against Lake 
Superior State. He wanted to 
play and he made sure Pearson 
knew. 
The junior forward closed 
last season with six goals 
and nine assists, an overall 
disappointing 
performance 
after many had anticipated a 
jump in production from his 

freshman to his sophomore 
year. Instead, he matched his 
freshman year point total and 
left many uninspired by his 
play.
And he picked up where he 
left off with his season debut 
against the Golden Knights 
last Friday. Neither the effort 
nor determination was there, 
let alone production. In turn, 
Pearson chose to sit him for the 
Saturday matchup of the series, 
which resulted in a loss.
Afterwards, Pearson sought 
him out and made sure he 
understood 
the 
reasoning 
behind the decision.
“We want to make sure 
we 
have 
open 
lines 
of 
communication,” Pearson said. 
“Door’s always open. We want 
the players to understand why 
they’re not playing. I think it’s 
important that they hear that 
from the coach and then you go 
from there.”
Becker 
listened 
to 
the 
critiques. 
He 
heard 
the 
concerns about his game — 
including about his effort and 
work ethic. To Pearson, every 
second of every shift matters. 
And Becker wasn’t maximizing 
his time on the ice. 
So he spent the week working 
on what needed to be done. 
“He did a real good job of 
reevaluating his game and the 
things he needs to do,” Pearson 
said. “And it’s not scoring.”
Ironically, working on the 
small things helped Becker 
tally three goals against the 
Lakers, one Friday and two 
Saturday. The two goals in 
the second matchup proved 
essential in a tight-knit one-
score game.
“I think just focusing on 
things that lead to goals,” 
Becker 
said 
on 
what 
was 
clicking for him, “like intensity, 
physical play, just getting to 
the net. I think that’s what 
contributes to putting pucks to 
the net. Focusing on the little 
things.”

One of those small things was 
battling hard. And to score his 
first goal Saturday, he fought 
hard for position in front of 
the net. After freshman Keaton 
Pehrson centered the puck into 
traffic, Becker secured the 
puck out the reach of pursuing 
sticks and backhanded it into 
the net.
Lake Superior State called 
for the play to be reviewed 
for offsides, but after a few 
minutes 
of 
deliberation, 
it 
was ruled onside, and Becker, 
sitting on the bench waiting 
for the decision, couldn’t help 
but turn his head to the Lakers’ 
bench and chirp.
The message he told them 
was unclear, but the message of 
his gritty play spoke for itself. 
He came ready to play.
“He got three goals on 
the weekend, but he played 
harder,” Pearson said, “played 
more determined, played more 
physical, won a lot of the 50/50 
battles, got to the net, so he 
did a lot of the small things, 
the little things that maybe he 
wasn’t doing last weekend.”
His second goal came from 
another hard fought battle in 
front of the net. On the power 
play, freshman forward Eric 
Ciccolini brought the puck 
from the blue line to freshman 
forward Johnny Beecher, who 
was waiting glove-side of the 
Lake Superior State goaltender. 
Making a cross-crease pass, 
Beecher delivered the puck to 
Becker. He whiffed on his first 
attempt at a shot. Recovering 
instantly, he tried again — this 
time finding twine.
It 
was 
a 
bounce-back 
performance for a player whose 
wasted shifts forced him from 
the ice to the press box, left to 
watch his team suffer in his 
absence.
“We like Jack,” Pearson said. 
“It’s nothing personal.”
It wasn’t personal. And on 
Saturday night, Becker made it 
strictly business.

How sweep it is!
Behind Jack Becker and a high-octane offense, Michigan earns its first wins of the season against Lake Superior State

MILES MACKLIN/Daily
Junior forward Jack Becker worked his way back into Michigan’s lineup after getting benched last week by Mel Pearson.

With added muscle and ‘green light’ 
Castleton looking to take the leap

Thanks to 20 pounds of 
added muscle, a green light 
and positional versatility, Colin 
Castleton feels ready to take a 
leap forward.
Like 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Michigan basketball program, 
things 
changed 
drastically 
for the sophomore forward 
this 
offseason. 
He 
showed 
promise as a shot-blocker in 
limited playing time during 
his freshman season, but a 
frail physical frame ultimately 
limited his impact.
That’s no longer the case.
Castleton remained in Ann 
Arbor over the summer, where 
he 
worked 
with 
strength 
and conditioning coach Jon 
Sanderson 
to 
gain 
much-
needed muscle. With first-
year coach Juwan Howard’s 
positionless 
basketball 
philosophy, his added speed, 
strength and ability to guard 
multiple positions bodes well 
for his anticipated spike in 
playing time.
The additional muscle helps, 
but it boils down to what 
Castleton can show in practice. 
So far this fall, it’s making an 
impact.
“It’s 
been 
so 
different, 
especially since his freshman 
year,” said senior center Jon 
Teske. “Coming in last year it 
was so easy to move him around. 
Now this year, I’m having a 
little bit more difficulty. He’s 
put in so much time and effort 
and he has a great work ethic.”
Added junior forward Isaiah 
Livers: “He’s definitely rolling 
to the basket and banging with 
big (redshirt junior center) 
Austin Davis and Jon Teske. 
Those are some shot blockers 
and rim protectors in there, 
and he’s rolling into them, their 
bodies and putting that 20 
pounds extra on them.”
In that regard, Howard’s 
hiring is a plus. Castleton 
cited his new coach’s emphasis 
on using his base to score on 
bigger defenders, adding that 

Howard uses a football pad to 
bump the Wolverines’ big men 
around the rim in practice.
“Everyday, 
(Howard) 
is 
working us out one-on-one, all 
the big guys, and he’s the coach 
that’s getting down and dirty 
with us,” Castleton said. “… I 
don’t think it’s (something) any 
other coach can do because he’s 
that position player. He’s done 
it for so long, played at every 
level, so it’s great personally for 
me.”
Still just 46 years old and six 
years removed from winning an 
NBA title with the Miami Heat, 
Howard’s experience brings a 
special element to his big men 
in practice. In five seasons as 
an assistant coach on Miami’s 
staff, his coaching keyed the 
breakouts of Hassan Whiteside 
and Bam Adebayo. And to 
Howard, 
there 
isn’t 
much 
difference between coaching 
big men at the NBA and college 
levels.
“When it comes to the bigs, 
I’m hands-on,” Howard said. 
“I’m there working them out, I 
grab the pad or I play defense 
on them. I love teaching, so 
I’m big on player development 
hands-on.”
The scrimmages aren’t any 
easier than the physical drills 
for Castleton, who deals with a 
30-pound weight disadvantage 
when guarding Teske. But like 
Teske last season, Castleton 
is looking to add a long-range 
shot to his arsenal. He didn’t 
attempt many threes last year 

despite shooting well from 
distance in high school, but 
Castleton’s teammates claim 
his stroke has looked good in 
practice so far.
“Last year, he didn’t have 
that green light Teske had, 
but he’s definitely going to get 
that green light to be shooting 
the ball because Colin’s a very, 
very talented big man,” Livers 
said. “… (His shot) looks like 
it has last year, he just never 
really got the chance to do it. 
It never really caught on to the 
philosophy last year and that 
kind of made him struggle.”
For a team that lost over half 
of last year’s scoring to the 
NBA Draft, Castleton’s added 
muscle and green light from 
behind the arc could be crucial 
early in the season. With Livers 
and freshman forward Franz 
Wagner expected to shoulder 
much of the load from the 
wing, Castleton will produce 
immediately 
if 
he 
proves 
capable of scoring both inside 
and out.
In nine minutes of action 
against Nebraska last February, 
Castleton 
posted 
11 
points 
on 
5-of-7 
shooting, 
three 
rebounds and a block. Regular 
performances like that on a 
greater scale can stretch the

whether or not he makes the 
leap his teammates expect.
