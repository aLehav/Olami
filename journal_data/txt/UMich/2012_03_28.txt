LEGAL DISPUTE
Shirvell firing
made official

Former assistant
AG can't appeal
termination
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staffreporter
Nearly two years after
Andrew Shirvell, a former
'Michigan assistant attorney
general, was initially fired after
accusing former student body
president Chris Armstorng of
having a "radical homosexual
agenda" on his personal blog,
Shirvell's termination has been
confirmed and he can no longer
legally appeal the decision.
Yesterday morning, William
Hutchens, a hearing officer
at the Michigan Civil Service
Commission issued a decision to
terminate Shirvell for "harass-
ing conduct of the basest sort."
The decision to. fire Shirvell
centered around his creation
of a blog titled the "Chris Arm-
strong Watch" in 2010 that
openly debased Armstrong, the
first openly gay president of the
Michigan Student Assembly,
now known as Central Student
Government. The decision stat-
ed that the ensuing media cov-
erage "made a media spectacle
of himself and the Department
of the Attorney General," and

was grounds for dismissal.
The decision further states
that it was unacceptable to see
Shirvell "engage in the repre-
hensible speech, lies and half-
truths that are set forth in the
grievant's 'blog' postings."
In the blog, Shirvell did not
originally identify himself as
assistant attorney general, but
after an interview with WXYZ-
TV, the Detroit-area ABC affili-
ate,'it became public knowledge'
that he was a state government
employee.
In fall 2010, Shirvell, Arm-
strong, and Attorney General
Mike Cox appeared on "Ander-
son Cooper 360°", a nationally
televised program on CNN, to
discuss the situation. Soon after,
Shirvell appeared on "The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart", in
which Stewart emphasized the
contrast between his actions
and Cox's anti-cyber bullying
campaign.
In light of the scandal, the
University's Department of
Public Safety issued Shirvell a
trespassing warning, which for-
bade him from entering Univer-
sity property. The warning was
later reduced, and only forbade
Shirvell from going near Arm-
strong.
In October 2011, Shirvell filed
a complaint against Armstrong's

There's no pressure at the
50th Ann Arbor Film Festival.
It's doubtful your friends will
shun you if they discover you
failed to catch "Craig Baldwin
- Society of Spectacle," a col-
lection of films that uses the
found-footage format to trans-
form traditional documen-
tary filmmaking. You probably
won't find a group of partygoers

Cuban fishing village; whereas
it's likely you'll hear someone
regurgitating their love for
"The Hunger Games." In other
words, the Ann Arbor Film Fes-
tival isn't here to give you social
currency - that's not the point.
The point - over the next
five days, in more than 10 differ-
ent venues - is simple: film. To
view films you won't find any-
where else, discuss movies face-
to-face with the artists who
created them, jump locations
(the Michigan Theater to the
Raven's Club to Sava's) to catch
as much as you can, and funda-

ing. The festival doesn't want to
operate on that level - it's casu-
al avant-garde.
.'We want to have artists'
work presented in the best pos-
sible environment, in the cin-
ema, and engage audiences with
what's possible on the screen,"
Donald Harrison, executive
director of the festival, said.
"The festival is very commit-
ted, dedicated to the spirit of
independent film ... across the
spectrum of what's possible in
the cinema."

Zimmerman's account and other
details emerge in Martin shooting

Police accused of
slandering fallen
boy's reputation
SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - A slain
Florida teenager and the neigh-
borhood watch captain who shot
and killed him exchanged words
before the teen punched him
in the nose and began banging
the man's head on the ground,
according to the watch captain's
account of the confrontation
that led to the shooting.
The Orlando Sentinelrejort-
ed that George Zimmerman told
police he lost 17-year-old Tray-
von Martin in the neighbor-
hood he regularly patrolled and
was walking back to his vehicle
last month when the youth
approached him from behind.
The two exchanged words,
Zimmerman said, and Martin
then punched him, jumped on
top of him and began banging
his head on a sidewalk. Zim-
merman said he began crying

for help; Martin's family thinks
it was their son who was crying
out. Witness accounts differ and
911 tapes in which the voices are
heard are not clear.
A statement from Sanford
police said the newspaper story
was "consistent" with evidence
turned over to prosecutors.
Because Martin was black
and Zimmerman has a white
father and Hispanic mother, the
case has become a racial flash-
point that has civil rights lead-
ers and others leading a series of
protests in Sanford and around
the country. Zimmerman said
he shot Martin in self-defense
and has not been arrested.
Meanwhile, Martin's parents
are blaming police for leak-
ing information about their son
being suspended for marijuana
and details about the fight he
had with Zimmerman that por-
trayed the teen as the aggressor.
Martin's mother, SybrinaFul-
ton, and family attorneys said
Monday that it was part of an
effort to demonize her son.

"They killed my son and now
they're trying to kill his reputa-
tion," Fulton told reporters.
Martin was suspended by
Miami-Dade County schools
because traces of marijuana
were found in a plastic baggie in
his book bag, family spokesman
Ryan Julison said. Martin was
serving the suspension when he
was shot Feb. 26.
The Sanford Police Department
insisted there was no authorized
release of the new information
but acknowledged there may have
been a leak. City Manager Nor-
ton Bonaparte Jr. said it would
be investigated and the person
responsible could be fired.
Martin family attorney Benja-
min Crump said the link between
the youth and marijuana should
have no bearing on the probe into
his shooting death. State and fed-
eral agencies are investigating,
with a grand jury set to convene
April10.
"If he and his friends experi-
mented with marijuana, that is
completely irrelevant," Crump

said. "What does it have to do
with killing their son?"
The state Department of Juve-
nile Justice confirmed Monday
that Martin does not have a juve-
nile offender record. The informa-
tion came after a public records
request by The Associated Press.
Despite the news of Martin's
possible actions the night of the
shooting, rallies demanding the
arrest of the 28-year-old Zim-
merman spread from Florida to
Indiana.
Thousands rallied Monday
on the steps of the Georgia state
Capitol. The crowd chanted "I
am Trayvon!" and "Arrest Zim-
merman now!" The protest ended
with the crowd linkinghands and
singing, "We Shall Overcome."
Students from Morehouse Col-
lege, Spelman College and Clark
Atlanta University encouraged
their fellow students to talk to
their lawmakers about gun laws.
Students wore hoodies that said,
"I am Trayvon Martin" and loft-
ed signs reading, "Don't shoot!"
and "I could be next."

Judge throws out
FBI's case against
Michigan militia
A federal judge dismissed
the most serious charges yes-
teray against seven members
of a Michigan militia who were
rounded up as homegrown
extremists accused of plotting
war against the U.S., saying
their expressed hatred of law
enforcement didn't amount to
conspiracy against the govern-
ment.
The decision is an embar-
rassment for the government,
which secretly planted an infor-
mant and an FBI agent inside
the Hutaree militia four years
ago and claimed members were
armed for war in rural southern
Michigan.
U.S. District Judge Victoria
Roberts granted requests for
acquittal on the most serious
charges: conspiring to commit
sedition, or rebellion, against
the U.S. and conspiring to use
weapons of mass destruction.
Other weapons crimes tied to the
alleged conspiracies also were
dismissed.

ous events to raise awareness in
recent months, including a lec-
ture on immigration reform last
month by Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist Jose Antonio Vargas.
Morales didn't become a legal
resident until last summer and
said he often felt ashamed in
high school because of his immi-
gration status.
"I just lied to my friends and
told them I was really bad at
driving and that's why I didn't
drive," Morales recounted. "I
feared being reported and sent
to (live in) a country I had never
been to."
Morales said he was encour-
aged by the University's recep-
tion of the coalition's goals and
emphasized the importance for
tuition equality in his speech.
"We're talking about human
beings who don't want a leg up,
who don't want an advantage in
any way," Morales said. "(They)
simply want to be treated like
everyone else."
LSA sophomore Evelyn Gal-
van, a PILOT representative,
said she decided to help with
the forum because she believes
undocumented students from
Michigan should be able to pay
in-state tuition costs and wants
to get others involved.
"One of the things that we
think is very important is ...
really looking at the University
as working for us," she said. "At
the end of the day, every office
that is here is here to work for
the students and to make the
students' time here better."
Galvan said PILOT and CTE
have attended multiple meet-
ings of the University's Board of
Regents to discuss the issue and

"Now that we have done the
awareness things, we really
want this event to be the action
planning of this whole move-
ment," Galvan said. "We do
have a panel, but it's not just a
panel. It's about everyone get-
ting involved in the discussion
on why we value higher educa-
tion."
The event featured four pan-
elists and a question and answer
session, after which the attend-
ees were broken into smaller
groups to discuss ways to help
the undocumented students.
Public Policy junior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, who formed CTE,
said he was happy with the
turnout for the "low-key" event.
"The people we had on the
panel provided really powerful
narratives and powerful infor-
mation that I think people could
take away from this," Mersol-
Barg said. "I think the kind of
impact we had will be long-last-
ing, (and) the people here will
advocate for this to the various
communities they come from. "
He said the forum provided
an avenue to "localize" the
problem and clear up any per-
petuated falsehoods about the
issue.
"If you put a face to the issue,
if you tell them, 'Are you going
to deny this individual a Univer-
sity education?' I think they're
going to have a much harder
time saying yes," Mersol-Barg
said. "When you move away

ment towards one where it's a

the barriers, the financial bar-

really effective."

1,000 times the speed of Flash,
according to a University press

Wei Lu, an associate professor
in the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sci-
ence, co-founded Crossbar and
said he has high expectations
for the memristor chips, though
he noted they won't be produced
immediately.
"It's a major market and a
major product, so it will definite-
ly take some time," Lu said.
Lu added that the technol-
ogy for the chip production
was developed in 2005 when he
began his tenure at the Universi-

Juan Martinez, one of the
panelists and principal of Cesar
Chavez Academy in Detroit,
highlighted the number of
undocumented students in
Detroit who would benefit from
access to in-state tuition costs
and financial aid.
"This year, 45 of our stu-
dents, (which is) 35 percent, are
undocumented," Martinez said.
"I've seen the look of hopeless-
ness as they get closer to gradu-
ation ... they have no idea what
they're going to do when they
graduate."
Panelist Kimberly Reyes, a
research assistant at the Nation-
al Forum on Higher Education
for the Public Good, discussed
the need for colleges and uni-
versities to make their own poli-
cies on undocumented students,
separate from any state policies.
"States do not admit stu-
dents," Reyes said. "Colleges
and universities do."
The final panelist, Karina
Moore, director of admissions
at the University's School of Art
& Design, discussed the vari-
ous undocumented populations
in Michigan who would benefit
from increased tuition equality.
"This is not just a Latino
issue," Moore said. "They are all
citizens of our state who want to
be actively engaged in our com-
munity ... and cannot be."
Rackham student Eliza-
beth Barrios, who came to the
U.S. from Venezuela, said she
attended the event to stand in
solidarity with the undocu-

"I myself am an immigrant,"
Barrios said. "I guess I feel a

their legal status."

He said the chips will replace
hard drives in storing flash
memory and may be used either
independently or with other
technologies.
Lu added that Crossbar is
grateful for the University's
support in its endeavors, since
investment in technology pro-
duction is rare.
"(Chip production) is very
expensive and that's why many
people are not funding," Lu said.
"It's also high risk, but obviously,
if the technology is right, the
return is very high too."
Lu said he could not comment
on the amount the University
will invest since Crossbar is still
in negotiations.

pelling Americans to either pur-
chase health insurance or pay a
fee - is unconstitutional, itcould
invalidate the entire law or leave
the legislation standing without
the mandate.
Friedman said he anticipates
that the court will most likely
uphold the individual mandate
on the basis that Congress has the
authority to regulate interstate
commerce and do what it deems
necessary.
"This seems to me to be a
mechanism that is perfectly
plausible, perfectly reasonable
for Congress, and it's a matter of
political choice," he said. "And I
think the court in the end is not
going to find that it was beyond
Congress's power."
However, for the Supreme
Court to uphold the mandate,
one of the five more conserva-
tive members on the bench would
have to join its four liberal-lean-
ing justices -Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena
Kagan and Stephen Breyer.
Friedman said he expects one
of the five more conservative jus-
tices - Antonin Scalia, Anthony
Kennedy, Clarence Thomas,
Samuel Alito Jr. or Chief Justice
John G. Roberts Jr. - to vote
along with the court's liberalbloc
of the Court.
"It's conceivable, I suppose,
that all five will stick together
and knock it out," he said. "But
it'd be the first time in 70 years
that the Supreme Court is knock-
ing out a major, comprehensive
piece of federal legislation on the
grounds that it's beyond Con-
gress power."

in the processing of the case,
before ultimately filing to remove
her from litigation of the incident
in November 2011. Specifically,
Shirvell said Gordon persuaded
special investigator Mike Onde-
jko in his examination of Shirvell
for "job-related impropriety" that
led to his termination.
"Ms. Gordon used her prior
relationship with the investiga-
tor Mike Ondejko to basically ...
get me fired," Shirvell said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily in October.
Gordon countered by fil-
ing a motion against Shirvell in
December 2011, stating his claims
were unjust.
"He claims that everything I've

under the age of 26 increased by
about 900,000 between Janu-
ary 2010 and March 2011. The
Obama administration attributed
the rise to the provision in the
Affordable Care Act.
The uptick lowered the per-
centage of uninsured 18-to-25
year olds to 24.2 percent in
2011's second quarter from the
28 percent in third quarter of
2010, according to a Gallup poll
released the same week as the
CDC data.
Matthew Davis, an assistant
professor in the Medical School
and Ford School of PublicPolicy,
said the provision could remain
in place even if it is invalidated
since it might bolster the election
chances of members of Congress.
"If you think about it, a young
adult who can get his or her par-
ents' plan can potentially bring
in two votes, because the young
adult votes, and so does the par-
ent," Davis said.
While Davis said the provi-
sion may continue, ,the planned
expansion of Medicaid and the
establishment of state market-
places for insurance plans could
fail without federal funding.
At the University, a University
Health Services survey found
that 9.4 percent of undergraduate
students are uninsured, Robert
Winfield, the University's chief
health officer and UHS director,
said in an interview last week.
The figure marked a 2-percent
increase over the last three years.
Winfield said while fewer stu-
dents are opting to enroll in the
University-offered insurance
program - 1,350 are enrolled
today, compared to 3,000 a
decade ago - the investment is
worthwhile.
"It's pretty common for appen-
dicitis to be $10,000 to $15,000,
or a bill for an auto accident to be
substantially higher than that,"
he said. "Everything we can do to
assure a higher level of insurance
for poor students is a good idea."

Since the incident, Armstrong

said the decision to create the

himself and his parents to inspire
students to excel and transcend
the effects of bullying.
"My parents and I decided to
start a scholarship for students
who've been bullied, to come to
the University of Michigan ... and
show students how it gets better,"
Armstrong said.

Tickets are too much
The Athletic Department shouldn't raise prices
ost University Students are proud of the Michigan ath-
letic programs. They feel a close, emotional attachment
to the University's nationally renowned varsity teams
- especially football, men's basketball and hockey. College athlet-
ics are an integral part of the Wolverine experience, and the Ath-
letic Department shouldn't make it more expensive for students to
attend the games.

I

This is my last election. After my election, I'll have
more flexibility."
- President Barack Obama to Russian President DmitriMedvedev yesterday
about the state of missle defense negotiations after November's election

A need for recognition

The Athletic Department has increased
prices for football and men's basketball stu-
dent season tickets for the upcoming season.
Individual home football game tickets rose
from $31.50 to $32.50 this year, and the price
of basketball season tickets increased 50 per-
cent to $150. But next football season, Michi-
gan only hosts six games, compared to eight
in 2011. Many of Michigan's home opponents
aren't its biggest rivals as the Wolverines play
Nebraska, Notre Dame and Ohio State on the
road, yet ticket prices have still gone up.
This hike in ticket prices is unwarranted.
Debt-ridden students are already struggling
to manage the daily expenses of college as
it becomes increasingly expensive. With
cuts to the University's budget made by the
state, tuition prices have increased, textbook
expenditures are weighing heavy on stu-
dents' pockets and now sports ticket prices
have increased as well.
Hunter Lochmann, the Athletic Depart-
ment's chief marketing officer, claims that
the purpose of the increase in prices is to
keep them level with those of other insti-
tutions and to encourage fans to arrive to
games early and amplify the Michigan spir-
it. With record-breaking attendance at the
night game against Notre Dame last season,
students have proven that the Michigan spir-
it hasn't faded.

An increase in ticket prices will not make
students more excited for the games - if any-
thing, it will have the opposite effect. The
Athletic Department should bolster student
pride by making student tickets more afford-
able. The Athletic Department's motives for
raising ticket prices are fairly obvious. The
men's basketball and football teams greatly
improved last season, and expectations going
into the next season are sky-high for both
squads. The Athletic Department has identi-
fied this as an opportunity to profit from our
enthusiasm.
The Athletic Department shouldn't exploit
its students like this. There's no doubt that
students will still buy the season tickets no
matter what the price is because of the inelas-
tic and high demand to attend the games
- further proving how dedicated Michigan
fans are. Contrary to what Lochmann sug-
gested, students don't need a price increase
to encourage them to come to the games ear-
lier. The Athletic Department shouldn't try
to make money off students' dedication and
emotional investment in Michigan's sports
teams. Obviously the Athletic Department
would want to increase ticket prices with a
business perspective in mind. But, students
aren't merely consumers - they're the devot-
ed fans. A hike in ticket prices is unnecessary
and sends the wrong message to students.

ne of mankind's favor-
ite pastimes is criticizing
the younger generation
- your parents
have probably -
bragged before
about how their
generation tis
better than
yours. Almostr
inevitably, the
younger gen-
eration rolls its DAR-WEI
collective eyes CHEN
when hearing
the criticism,
citing some sort of misunderstand-
ing caused by the "generation gap."
I want to take this opportunity to
complain about something I see in
my own generation. Perhaps the
criticism will be more well-received
in this manner.
My gripe with my generation
is as follows: members of Genera-
tion Y want credit for everything
they do, no matter how menial the
accomplishment is. I'll admit that
this gripe applies to me sometimes
- I'm just observing the trend and
reporting on it. Whether the devel=
optaent was caused by social media
or simply exacerbated by it is debat-
able. And the motives for trying to
garner said credit are varied: self-
aggrandizement, need for reassur-
ance, social competitiveness, etc.
But regardless of cause or motive,
Generation Y is undoubtedly hun-
gry for credit and praise.
To see the phenomenon in action,
simply log onto Facebook. One of the
disturbing recent trends is people
posting pictures of their food. Of
course, some food-related moments
are worth savoring, such as prepar-
ing a difficult dish or dining at a spe-
cial place. However, news feeds now
often present users with friends'
pictures of even relatively average
foods. Nothing to get excited about
- after all, every human being eats
at least somewhat regularly.
The reason people post pictures

of even routine meals is simple:
Once the food is eaten, they can't
get credit for having the food
anymore. Especially if they pre-
pared the food themselves, the lost
chance for credit can potentially
be devastating. What bothers me.
is that Generation Y feels the need
to document commonplace events,
such as eating, to gain some mar-
ginal credit for their accomplish-
ments. Preparing and consuming
food is basic human sustenance - a
lack of documentation shouldn't be
disconcerting.
To be clear, I'm not necessarily
slamming food pictures specifically
- I'm slamming those who want
credit for every part of their lives,
eatingbeitnga particularlyegregious
example of something ordinary
for which people still want credit.
Another example can be found in
applications such as Foursquare,
which enables people to take credit
for frequenting the gym, for exam-
ple. I'll concede that hittingthe gym
is less of a necessity than eating,
meaning gym trips are slightly more
worthy of announcement. However,
for people who exercise often, any
given trip is routine and therefore
not announcement-worthy. They're
likely reporting it repeatedly to get
the social credit associated with
being active.
Even ostensibly well-intentioned
actions can have underlying credit-
grabbing motivations. The most
recent viral internet movement was
Kony 2012, a campaign by Invisible
Children, Inc. to bring Ugandan war
criminal Joseph Kony to justice. I
acknowledge the campaign and its
good intentions. But for many in the
social media world, Kony presented
a chance to appear noble and well-
informed, possibly one too good to
pass up. You've probably seen many
of your friends casually posting on
Facebook about him.
How do I knowthatpeople in Gen-
eration Y probably don't care much
about Kony? Ask yourself if you're

still hearing about him now.The fact
that so many of these movements
end up as transient fads reveals, in
my opinion, that people care only
enough to the point that it helpstheir
own image. After that point, the per-
sonal returns are diminishing and
not worth pursuing.
When people expend effort to get
credit for menial accomplishments,
they develop inflated senses of self-
importance. And while Generation
Y isn't full of slackers like some in
Generation Y
wants credit for
everything.
older generations would believe, it
doesn't need to be conceited either.
I believe credit should be given only
when it's due. For example, instead
of sharing every gym trip, perhaps
tweeting about reaching an exer-
cise milestone is more appropriate.
If you have an insightful comment
to make about a social movement,
contribute your comment to the
discourse instead of casually refer-
encing the movement just to appear
knowledgeable.
All people want recognition at
some level, as Professor Abraham
Maslow has theorized in his Hierar-
chy of Needs pyramid. I realize that
nothingis wrongwithwantingpraise
- I'm particularly needy myself.
With this column, I'm merely dif-
ferentiating between what is praise-
worthy and what isn't. They say that
champions are made when no one's
watching. My fear is that Generation
Y always wants to be watched.

Prima facie

On March 15, the Multi-Ethnic Infor-
mation Exchange hosted an event at the
School of Information to explore the swirl-
ing controversy around a mobile application
recently patented by Microsoft. Among other
things, the app communicates with users'
GPS devices to provide directions around
unsafe neighborhoods. Microsoft rejected
the negative criticism of its product - which
some labeled the "Avoid the Ghetto App"
- by stating the classification of "unsafe"
neighborhoods stems from crime statistics
and demographics. The MIX discussion did
not attempt to respond to the alleged racism
inherent in the concept, but rather sought
to provoke a larger discussion of informa-
tion, ethics and our role between the two as
emerging professionals.
By all accounts, the dialogue succeeded
in exchanging ideas, identifying responsi-
bilities and broadening perspectives. I left
the lecture hall immensely encouraged by
the capacity of SI students to enact positive
change in the lives of citizens everywhere.
And while I still retain that optimism, the
recent shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon
Martin in Sanford, Fla., an Orlando suburb,
diminishes,a small portion of that attitude..
His assailant, 28-year-old George Zimmer-
man, informed police he shot the teenager
- who was black - in self-defense. This is
despite the fact that after he phoned authori-
ties about a "suspicious" young man "walk-
ing around and looking about," Zimmerman
exited his vehicle with a 9-millimeter hand-
gun and began to follow Martin. A physical
encounter occurred, the specifics of which
may never be known, and it concluded with
a single gunshot wound to Martin's chest. He
was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.
Sanford Police continue to reiterate they
have no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman
- who is white - due to a vague 2005 Florida
law allowing a person to use deadly force if
under the belief that great bodily harm or
death is imminent. In essence, so long as
Zimmerman perceived Martin to be a threat
to his life, he possessed the right to "stand
his ground." Since Martin is no longer alive
to prove he did not pose such a threat to Zim-
merman law enforcement officials declare
their hands to be tied. Issues abound with the
case, prompting state and federal authorities
to launch their own investigation.
Now, I'm no lawyer, nor will I pretend to

be just for the sake of argument. But as an
archival student, Iam eerily reminded of this
19th-century legal doctrine: "A colored man
is, prima facie, a slave." The precept resulted
in the illegal detention and enslavement of
countless free blacks, as the courts ascribed
the burden unto them to prove their free-
dom. Likewise, Sanford authorities first need
evidence. to verify Martin did not endan-
ger Zimmerman's life, a deeply problematic
commentary in this era with the nation's
first black president. That a self-appointed
neighborhood watchman can successfully
justify Jim Crow-esque vigilantism under
the auspices of perception demonstrates the
great distance we have to travel toward racial
understanding in our country. Such a real-
ity should be a cause for concern not just in
Florida, but all across the nation. The willful
inaction of the Sanford Police Department
has sent a clear and unambiguous message
to American society: primafacie, young black
men are criminals.
That sobering prejudice brings me back to
the Microsoft application. While intendingto
increase safety, it ultimately produces a men-
tality in which they are out to get us. It rests
upon the unsubstantiated claim that certain
people living in certain areas commit certain
crimes more frequently than others. Increas-
ingly, the targets of those dog whistles tend
to be younger and browner. This same notion
led the killer of Grosse Pointe's Jane Bashara
to dump her body on the east side of Detroit.
Surely, the murderer thought, these heinous
crimes always happen near Gratiot Avenue,
leaving the police to assume one of them did
it.
In the end, there is perhaps no data a
Microsoft researcher could aggregate to
inform Trayvon Martin of the danger he
eventually met. Indeed, we must give pause
to remember that the crimes prosecuted are
rarely the whole of crimes committed. A
black boy was stalked, shot and killed as he
walked home with a bag of candy and a can
of iced tea. If that's not criminal, I'm not sure
any of us knows what is. That his admitted
killer is a free man wages a psychological war
against Martin's parents that is just as vio-
lent, senseless and avoidable as the murder of
their child.

I justwant my medicine

On a sunny morning during my freshman year of
college, I woke up to my insides being pummeled. This
was nothing new - for eight years Ihad struggled with
monthly ordeals of incapacitating corporal mutiny. But
it was the first week of school, so I began walking to
class. I ended up collapsing on a bathroom floor, vom-
iting, drenched in sweat and immobilized with agony.
After what seemed like years, an ambulance came and
paramedics took me to the hospital.
We never found out what happened that day. But
they put me on birth control to prevent another hospi-
tal visit. Three years and a few other female conditions
later, the birth control pill is still the only medication
protecting me against needlessly suffering again.
A lot of guy friends ask why I take the pill if I'm not
having sex. I was offended until I realized that they
believed the common misconception that oral contra-
ceptives are only for people having sex. Many use this
fallacy - citing society's declining sexual morality and
religious freedom - to express opposition to the bill
requiring all private insurance plans to cover oral con-
traceptives. But for me, the pill is a medicine.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, about 11.2
million women in the United States take the pill.
Another 6.5 million use oral contraceptives in part
for non-contraceptive benefits. 1.56 million women
take the pill strictly for non-contraceptive purposes -
762,000 of which have never had sex.
Oral contraceptives are powerful. Medical research
indicates that they significantly decrease the risk of
ovarian, colorectal and uterine cancer. The pill can also
treat dysfunctional uterine bleeding, acne, endometrio-
sis, menstrual cramps, hypermenorrhea, PMS, PMDD,
ovarian cysts, chocolate cysts, fibroids, polycystic ovar-
ian syndrome and irregular menstrual cycles.
I find it disconcerting when people like Rush Lim-
baugh and Foster Friess call women taking oral contra-
ceptives "sluts" or advise them to put "aspirin between

their knees," especially since more than 6 million
women take the pill for medical reasons.-These condi-
tions are not sexually transmitted, and I doubt absti-
nence prevents or cures any of them. Limbaugh and
Friess's words demonstrate the importance of taking
women's health seriously and using education to abol-
ish misconceptions about the pill.
While I respect someone's opposition to the pill's
contraceptive benefits, I have to wonder what gives
anybody permission to deny someone healthcare. If
nobody would deny a diabetic insulin for religious
reasons, why would they deny a woman medicine for
endometriosis? For that matter, if a woman needed an
operation for something otherwise preventable by the
pill, would objectors pay for her surgery, medication
and hospital bills? If the woman was unable to treat
her condition because the objector denied her access to
the necessary treatment, wouldn't the objector be cul-
pable for her needing surgery? While I hope objectors
would foot the bill for potential cases like this, I doubt
they'd be willing to pay for the thousands of women
who would suffer the consequences of the objector's
"conscience."
I invite opponents of the birth control bill to con-
sider who their decision could affect - because illness
strikes regardless of faith, chastity or politics. What if
their wives, girlfriends, daughters or sisters had con-
ditions that needed to be treated with oral contracep-
tives? Would they deny their loved ones the pill? Could
they watch their loved ones needlessly suffer because
of them? If they could do that in good conscience, I sup-
pose they have that right. But before anybody makes
that choice, I hope they remember the Bible verse
Zechariah 7:9, "This is what the LORD Almighty said:
'Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion
to one another."'

still see today."
Despite unrequited love and
class inadequacy, the show is full
of light interludes and comedic
nuances that attempt to carry the
show from one scene to anoth-
er without much pause. The
charged scenes all come to a head
in the Act 1 finale, in which the
bulk of the action happens.
"(Gilbert and Sullivan) shows
are known for their Act 1 finales,"
said Greg Hassold, artistic direc-
tor for the show. "You build up
all the drama and it winds up to
a pitch, and very silly accidents
evolve in the second act."
To enhance the visual effects

of the melodramatic exchang-
es, the show employs highland
dance, a fast-paced form of Scot-
tish dancing intricate in its tech-
nique and performance. Though
classical highland dance involves
single perfgrmances, the show
adapted the style to fit the cho-
rus. Hassold explained that the
finale of the first act culminates
with a large dance number that
involves the finished highland-
dance product.
"I'm particularly pleased with
the chorus in (the Act I finale)
scene," Hassold said. "We took
highland dance and adapted it so
that a chorus can do it and so that
it looks impressive. We're doing a
lot more dance than I've seen in
some of the shows before, and it
works."
The liveliness of dance and
variety in performance culmi-

nates in the sing-song tunes that
reflect every turn and switch of
mood, accordingto Day.
"You have a bunch of little sec-
tions that tie themselves togeth-
er," Day said. "You have a little bit
of sadness, a little bit of happiness
and a bit of doom from the sailor."
"Musically, it becomes dif-
ficult because you go from one
section to the other, no stops, and
you're going to have to be ready
to quickly change the mood, not
only of the singers but the orches-
tra as well," he added. "The music
follows the action really well, but
it's something you have to be pre-
pared for."
With the technically intense
dancing, dramatically variant
mood and catchy songs, "H.M.S.
Pinafore" will aim to deliver a
newfound, comedic spin on the
age-old love story.

fact, it intends to represent the
opposite ideal: an exchange of
opinions and values in an envi-
ronment characterized by open-
ness and conversation. There are
12 free screenings at this year's
festival and 25 percent of the
festival is free and open to the
public, encouraging attendance
among the event's skeptics.
"(There are) alotofopportuni-
ties to go hear artists talk about
their work, see artists' work,
engage in conversation about
what we're watching together,
what we're exposing ourselves
to, what we're consuming or
digesting on the screen," Harri-
son said.
"That's one of the most impor-

of seeing as much as possible
... I would encourage people to
approach it differently than they

weekend to the movies, where
you might've heard about the
film (or) read a review."
Films and filmmakers are
coming to Ann Arbor from
locales as close as Detroit, and

as exotic as Singapore and the
Netherlands. Student-made
pieces will be shown today, and
throughout the festival, audi-
ences will be exposed to docu-
mentaries, music videos, historic
underground works and a mid-
night showing of George Lucas's
first feature length film, "THX
1138." And the best part is that
the experience doesn't end after
the credits roll.
"One of the most exciting
parts about our festival is so
many of those artists are here,"
Harrison said. "They're all flying
in, they're coming from around
the world, (giving attendees)
an opportunity to not just hear
themtalk about their work, but,
to go up to them and have a beer

Due to election results,
current CSG to meet again

Assembly discusses
resolutions on
funding, water
bottles
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff reporter
The Central Student Govern-
ment assembly held what was
supposed to be the last meeting
of its term, but election compli-
cations have forced the body to
hold another meetingnext week.
Difficulties in approving some
representative elections and the
current appeals being heard by
the Central Student Judiciary
have delayed the certification of
the elections, meaning the new
assembly won't take its seats
for at least another week. Mem-
bers of the University Elections
Commission attended the meet-
ing and addressed the assembly,
stressing the need for election-
code reform and explaining that
the results were not yet certified.
LSA senior Brendan Camp-
bell, the CSG vice president,
said that under the compiled
code the UEC was supposed to
certify the results at yesterday's
meeting, but the rules were sus-
pended indefinitely.
"Today, the assembly decided
to suspend these rules because
of the lingering concerns and
the high number of exception
ballots and the high number of
close races," Campbell said.
Campbell added that the
president and vice president will
be sworn in 10 days after the
UEC certifies the election, and
the new representatives will be
seated at the following assembly
meeting.
During the meeting, 13 reso-
lutions were discussed. Busi-
ness senior Matt Eral, speaker
of the assembly, said it was the

"most business-heavy week all
semester."
CSG President DeAndree
Watson said he anticipated a
long night, but was pleased by
the body's efficiency.
"I expected it to be really
long. I didn't expect it to end
before midnight," Watson said.
"I'm really impressed."
Eral said the surprisingly
expedient meeting could be due
to the newly-instated temporary
operating procedures. Over its
past three meetings, the assem-
bly has suspended its traditional
rules and has been using the
guidelines from a resolution to
alter the assembly's regulatory
procedures.
Eral added that using the
resolution's guidelines with-
out passing them has given the
assembly the opportunity to fig-
ure out the most efficient struc-
ture.
"This is tabled week to week
because ... if we're going to do
this, let's do it right," Eral said.
"We like the new rules, we want
to operate under them now, but
we ivant to make sure we've
flushed out everything."
A resolution regarding the
Student Organization Fund-
ing Commission passed unani-
mously, with two abstentions,
after weeks of debate. Eral said
the purpose of the resolution,
which was originally introduced
on Feb. 14, "solidified the rolling
funding process."
In the past, the assembly has
approved SOFC'sbudgetretroac-
tively, butnowSOFC will present
a report each week for approval.
This system will allow for more
legislative oversight and still
maintain SOFC's ability to dis-
tribute funding efficiently.
"SOFC does incredible and
everyone on the assembly rec-
ognizes that," Eral said. "We
just put what SOFC does in
the (compiled code) with a few

additional provisos ... it ended
up being a great product that
the assembly liked."
One passed resolution allo-
cates $6,000 to the University
to purchase reusable water bot-
tles for all incoming freshmen.
Barbara Hagan, an adminis-
trator in the Office of Campus
Sustainability, attended the
meeting to speak in support
of the resolution. Hagan said
6,500 freshmen will receive
reusable water bottles for a total
cost of $39,000.
"A lot of students when they
move in buy cases of bottled
water ... bottled water isn't good
for the environment," Hagan
said. "We're trying to send the
right message to our incoming
freshmen that sustainability is
important at Michigan."
Hagan added that it's a two-
part plan that coincides with
the recent addition of water
bottle refill stations across cam-
pus.
"We thought it was impor-
tant to get the infrastructure in
place so (students don't) have to
go across campus to find a water
refill station," Hagan said.
Campbell, who penned the
resolution, said it was part of
an "important, new sustainabil-
ity push by the Central Student
Government."
"By helping provide reusable
water bottles to all incoming
freshmen, we hope that we'll be
able to significantly improve the
way that students at the Univer-
sity consume water," Campbell
said.
Despite the 10 resolutions
ready for voting this week,
only five were passed and the
remaining five were tabled.
Nonetheless, Eral said this was
no reason for concern.
"Justbecause it's old business
doesn't mean we're not going to
vote on it," Eral said. "Some-
times we need more time."

question that the American peo-
ple are tired of war. But, he said,
the public understands the U.S. is
engaged in Afghanistan because
of the attacks on Sept. it, and to
prevent al-Qaida from again find-
ing safe havens there to launch
attacks.
"We cannot fight wars by
polls. If we do that we're in deep
trouble," Panetta told report-
ers at a press conference after a
day of meetings with Canadian
and Mexican defense ministers
here. "We have to operate based
on what we believe is the best
strategy to achieve the mission
that we are embarked on. And
the mission here is to safeguard
our country by insuring that the
Taliban and al-Qaida never again
find a safe haven in Afghanistan."
A New York Times/CBS News
poll found that 69 percent of
those questioned believe the
United States should not be at
war in.Afghanistan, and roughly
the same amount say the fighting
is going either somewhat or very
badly. The numbers are up sharp-
ly from four months ago, when a

bit more than half said the U.S.
should not be at war in Afghani-
stan.
The survey reflects a growing
frustration among the public and
on Capitol Hill with the war, even
as the Obama administration
tries to map out an exit strategy
that would shift the security lead
to the Afghans by mid-2013.
Canadian Defense Minister
Peter MacKay was even more
blunt about the poll, saying that
as one prime minister of Canada
put it: "Polls are for dogs."
"This is our generation's war,
this is a test of perseverance,"
said MacKay, whose country has
about 1,000 troops in Afghani-
stan, largely doing training. "Our
ability to carry through for the
long-term security of not just
Afghanistan but the region and
also the entire world, so there is a
lot at stake. Canada will be there
with our NATO partners."
Panetta said that a lot of lives
have been lost in the war, and
"our commitment must be to
insure that those lives have not
been lost in vain." He said that he
and his military commanders are
convinced that 2011 was a turn-
ing point in the war and that the
levels ofviolence are declining.
Panetta was in Ottawa to
meet with his defense counter-
parts, in what U.S. officials hope
will be a continuing effort to
address shared security threats,
including drug trafficking, cyber
breaches and border issues.
MacKay, Panetta, Gen. Guill-
ermo Galvan Galvan, Mexico's
national defense secretary, and
Adm. Mariano Francisco Saynex
Mendoza, Mexico's Navy secre-

tary, all said that the three coun-
tries must improve their defense
cooperation because many of
the threats that cross the North
American borders. The leaders
agreed to formalize the process
and continue to meet periodically
on the issues.
In other comments Tuesday,
Panetta restated his support for
the F-35 stealth fighter, and said
the U.S. needs it for the future.
But said the U.S. needs to con-
tinue to do as much oversight as
possible over the contract pro-
cess. And MacKay said the fight-
er is still the aircraft that Canada
wants, but there will be careful
monitoring of the program.
Canada's associate defense
minister, Julian Fantino, said
earlier this month that his gov-
ernment could back out of its
multibillion-dollar plan to buy
as many as 65 of the F-35 stealth
fighters from the United States.
The Lockheed Martin-manufac-
tured fighter is the Pentagon's
most expensive weapons pro-
gram and it has been troubled by
schedule delays and cost over-
runs.
In January, Panetta took the
program off the probation which
had been imposed by then-
Defense Secretary Robert Gates
a year earlier because it was
experiencing "significant test-
ing problems." But Panetta has
warned that the troubled pro-
gram is notyet out of the woods.
Ten years in, the total F-35
program cost has jumped from
$233 billion to an estimated $385
billion. Recent estimates suggest
the entire program could exceed
$1trillion over 50 years.

Raul Castro's
government rejects
calls for reform
HAVANA (AP) - Pope Bene-
dict XVI prayed for freedom
and renewal "for the greater
good of all Cubans" before the
nation's patron saint- yester-
day, but the island's communist
leaders quickly rejected the
Roman Catholic leader's appeal
for political change after five
decades of one-party rule.
The exchange came hours
ahead of a 55-minute closed-
door meeting with President
Raul Castro on the pontiff's
second day on the island. Brief
video feeds showed Castro
greeting Benedict at the Presi-
dential Palace and then later
seeing him off.
There was no visit to see Fidel
Castro, though a Vatican spokes-
mon would not rule out the pos-
sibility of a meeting before the
pope departs this afternoon.
Days after dismissing the
Marxist ideology on which the
Cuban system is based, Bene-
dict continued to gently press
themes highly sensitive to
Cubangovernment in his prayer
and short speech at the sanctu-
ary of the Virgin of Charity of
Cobre near the eastern city of

Santiago.
"I have entrusted to the
Mother of God the future of
your country, advancing along
the ways of renewal and hope,
for the greater good of all
Cubans," the pope said. "I have
also prayed to the Virgin for the
needs of those who suffer, of
those who are deprived of free-
dom, those who are separated
from their loved ones or who
are undergoing times of diffi-
culty."
It wasn't long before a top offi-
cial back in Havana responded.
"In Cuba, there will not be
political reform," said Marino
Murillo, Cuba's economic czar
and a vice president.
The pope has kept his lan-
guage lofty, his criticism vague
and open to interpretation, but
Murillo's comments left no room
for doubt, and they were quickly
picked up by pro-government
blogs and on Twitter accounts.
Raul Castro has said that
opening up Cuba's political sys-
tem would inevitably spell doom
for its socialist project since
any alternative party would be
dominated by enemies across
the Florida Straits and beyond.
Alfredo Mesa, a Cuban-
American National Founda-
tion board member whose trip
to, Cuba was organized by the
Miami Archdiocese, said the

government's strong reaction
would reinforce the pope's mes-
sage and the need for change.
"I'd rather have them say
this now than tomorrow," Mesa
said.
During a quiet moment at the
shrine of the Virgin of Charity,
Benedict also prayed for more
Cubans to embrace the faith in
a country that is the least Cath-
olic in Latin America. While
most Cubans are nominally
Catholic, fewer than 10 percent
practice the faith.
The pontiff knelt before
the crowned, wooden statue,
which stood on a covered table
shrouded in blue and white
cloth. Helped by two bishops,
the 84-year-old pontiff rose and
approached the icon, lit a candle
and stood in prayer as a choir
sang hymns.
He called on all Cubans "to
work for justice, to be servants
of charity and to persevere in
the midst of trials."
The pope pointedly referred
to the Virgin by her popular
name, La Mambisa, in a ges-
ture to the many non-Catholics
on the island who nonetheless
venerate the statue as an Afro-
Cuban deity. Mambisa is the
word for the Cuban fighters
who won independence from
Spain at the turn of the last cen-
tury.

Sudan bombs oil field in South Sudan

North's aggression
threatens fragil&
peace agreement
JUBA, South Sudan (AP) -
Sudan's military bombed an oil
field in South Sudan yesterday,
a South Sudan official said, as
a dangerous flare-up in border
violence appeared to scuttle
plans for a presidential summit
between the two countries.
Unity State Minister of Infor-
mation Gideon Gatpan said
Sudan dropped at least three
bombs near oil fields in the town
of Bentiu. Gatpan said the extent
of any damage wasn't immedi-
ately known.
The attack comes one day
after Sudan and South Sudan
clashed in the disputed border
town of Jau, prompting Sudan
togcancel President Omar al-
Bashir's trip to meet with South
Sudan President Salva Kiir next
week.
South Sudan broke away from
Sudan last year, but tensions
between the longtime foes have
remained high.
Among the unresolved issues
is the demarcation of the bor-
der and an agreement to share
oil revenue. South Sudan earlier
this year stopped pumping oil
because it said Sudan - which
owns the pipelines the south's oil
must travel through - was steal-
ingits oil.
Despite the increased vio-
lence, South Sudan held out hope
the presidential meeting could
still happen. South Sudan Min-
ister of Information Barnaba
Benjamin Marial said the south
still expects al-Bashir to attend
the meeting next week, saying
South Sudan had not received an
official cancellation from Khar-
toum.
Marial said the south believes
that "forces of war" in Khartoum

were trying to derail the peace
process, but not al-Bashir him-
self. He said the south would not
take the bait.
"Our president has said clearly
we will not be dragged into a
senseless war," Marial said. "We
will not be dragged into a conflict
with Sudan."
The two countries disputed
which side was the aggressor in
Monday's clash in Jau.
Marial said that Sudanese
troops "without any provocation"
bombed Jau on Monday after-
noon before Sudanese ground
forces and militia fighters moved
in. Marial said that South Sudan
troops repulsed the "invad-
ing forces" back to the town of
Heglig, Sudan. Marial had no
information on troop numbers
involved or casualty figures.
Sudanese authorities say South
Sudan started the fight.
"These attacks are the respon-
sibility of the SPLA and the
South Sudanese government,"
Sudanese Second Vice President
Alhaj Adam Yousif said during an
address on Sudanese state tele-
vision late Monday. "The SPLA
attacks have targeted our oil and
our army." The SPLA is an acro-
nym for South Sudan's military.
Sudan said that the Darfur-
based rebel group Justice and
Equality Movement, or JEM,
fought alongside the SPLA dur-
ing Monday's clash.
The border violence contin-
ued into yesterday near Benitu,
Gatpan said.
"They are hovering and drop-
ping over the northern part of
town in the oil fields, the main
Unity oil fields," Gatpan said. He
said teamswere being sent to the
oil fields to assess the damage.
Yousif said that given Mon-
day's violence, the presidential
visit to sign agreements recent-
ly reached in Ethiopia would
not happen.

"The visit of President Bashir
was tied to good neighborly
relations," said Yousif. "There is
no way for this summit to take
place now."
The cancellation of the sum-
mit effectively halts momentum
in negotiations between the
two countries on issues leftover
from a 2005 peace deal that
saw South Sudan separate from
Sudan last July.
Oil has been the biggest dis-
agreement. The row * prompted
South Sudan to shut down its
oil production in late January,
depriving both countries of a
critical revenue stream.
Talks were stalled until two
weeks ago when the two sides
reached an agreement on citi-
zenship and border demarca-
tion., The agreements - meant
to be signed next Tuesday -
were seen as positive steps.
But there were early signs the
deal might not hold. Both coun-
tries have accused each other
of supporting rebel groups on
either side of the border, though
both sides deny the allegations.
Sudan's Minister of Defense
Abdel-Rahim Mohamed Hus-
sein recently said that any
rebel activity in Sudan's South
Kordofan stafe could cancel the
agreements. Sudan is battling
the rebel SPLM-North, which
until South Sudan's secession
was linked to the south's ruling
party - the SPLA. The south
has said it is not supporting the
SPLM-North.
The cancellation of the presi-
dential summit will set north-
south relations back, said Aly
Verjee, an analyst for the Rift
Valley Institute.
"The new fighting unfortu-
nately trumps progress made in
recent negotiations. It is unsur-
prising that talks have been
canceled given those events,"
he said.

BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - The
body representing nations in
western Africa has suspended
Mali and has put a peacekeep-
ing force on standby in the most
direct threat yet to the junta
that seized control of this nation
in a coup last week.
Alassane Ouattara, the presi-
dent of Ivory Coast who is the
rotating chair of the Economic
Community of West African
States, or ECOWAS, told report-
ers after an emergency meeting
in the capital of Ivory Coast that
Mali's democracy cannot be
abandoned. A delegation of five
African presidents will head to
Mali within the next 48 hours
to try to "restore constitutional
order."
There is no immediate plan

of the ECOWAS commission.
The move suggests the bloc may
consider force if the mutinous
soldiers who overthrew Mali's
democratically elected leader do
not stand down.
"We cannot allow this coun-
try endowed with such precious
democratic instruments, dating
back at least two decades, to
leave history by regressing. It's
why Mali needs to immediately
return its democratic institu-
tions to normal," said Ouattara.
"This position is nonnegotia-
ble."
Already, the United States,
the European Union and France
have cut off all but essential aid,
representing a loss of tens of mil-
lions of dollars. Additional sanc-
tions from the region would be a
further blow to the junta, which

diers stormed the presidential
palace and drove into hiding
President Amadou Toumani
Toure, who was due to step
down next month. Ina matter of
hours, they erased two decades
of democratic rule.
Besides the threat of military
intervention, Mali's neighbors
could suffocate the nation finan-
cially. Many of'the 15 nations
represented on the regional bloc
share the same currency, and
they could together decide to cut
off Mali's supply of cash. Also if
nearby Ivory Coast were to shut
its border, landlocked Mali, a
nation twice the size of Texas
spanning over an expanse of
scrubland, verdant hills and des-
ert dunes, would run out of gaso-
line, which is trucked in from
Ivorian refineries.

Freshman dazzles
in one-hit winning
effort over Oakland
By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
In his first collegiate start,
freshman left-hander Trent
Szkutnik pitched like an estab-
lished ace for
the Michi- OAKLAND 1
gan baseball MICHIGAN 6
team. The
starter's impressive one-hit per-
formance is exactly what the
Wolverine bullpen needed in one
of their final games before Big
Ten play..
Michigan defeated Oakland,
6-1, with the help of strong per-
formances on the mound and at
the plate. Four Wolverine pitch-
ers let up a combined four hits in
Tuesday's victory over the Golden
Grizzlies; which extended Michi-
gan's win streak to three games.
The Wolverines (12-12) relied
heavily on the first three hitters
of their lineup, who contributed
five of the team's seven hits.
"I definitely had some pregame
jitters for my first career start,"
Szkutnik said. "I just knew what
I had to do. I had to go out there
, and throw strikes and let my
defense back me up. I felt really
comfortable with that."
Szkutnik mowed down Oak-
land's lineup in the first two
innings. Three groundballs and
three strikeouts got the Wolver-
ines off the field early. The first
scores of the game came late in
the third as Michigan batted in
two runs. A leadoff walk from
freshman shortstop Dylan Del-
aney put a Wolverine on base,
but Delaney was replaced by
sophomore catcher Cole Martin
after he grounded to the short-
stop. Junior center fielder Pat-
rick Biondi then smacked a ball
down the right-field line, earning
a double and advancing Martin to
third. After freshman Will Drake
struck out, sophomore Michael
O'Neill's single to left brought in
both Michigan base runners to
put the Wolverines on top.
Two more exceptional innings
from Szkutnik maintained Michi-
gan's lead going into the fifth,

first win of the season. The Gold-

up the loss with three strikeouts
and three walks in six innings of

"I thought Trent was outstand-

Maloney. "He has the chance to
be a really good pitcher. We just
wanted him ready for the week-
end, so we really were only going
to pitch him three innings. His
pitch count was only at 47, so we
let him go for four."
Tuesday's consistent pitching
performance will build confi-
dence in Michigan's bullpen as it
continues to search for a reliable
rotation. The Wolverines will also
look to continue their momentum
at the plate as they head into Big
Ten play this weekend.
"We're startingto come togeth-
er as a team hitting-wise," Drake
said. "It's a stepping stone in the
right direction, especially for Big
Ten play comingup. Once you can
put all the pieces of the puzzle
together, we honestly believe we
will be in the mix for the Big Ten
championship."

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
All season long, the Michi-
gan baseball team's offense has
been carried by the top of the
batting order. Tuesday was no
different.
Junior center fielder Patrick
Biondi, freshman left fielder
Will Drake and sophomore
right fielder Michael O'Neill
- the top three hitters in the
lineup - provided all the pro-
duction the Wolverines (12-12
overall) needed in their 6-1 vic-
tory against Oakland.
"Those three outfielders are
pretty good," said Michigan
coach Rich Maloney. "We feel
like we have three all-league
type players out there in the
outfield, which is a huge asset
for us. They're fun to watch."
Against three Golden Griz-
zlies' hurlers, the trio combined
to go 5-for-12, accounting for all
but two of Michigan's hits. They
also batted in five runs and stole
two bases.
According to Maloney, the
key to their success is simple.
"You've got to get timely
hits," Maloney said. "Even
though we didn't get it from the
rest of the lineup, O'Neill got a
timely hit today and Drake got a
timely hit today."
All five of the outfielders'
RBIs came on timely, two-out
hits. In the bottom of the third
inning, with sophomore catcher
Cole Martin on first base, Bion-
di smacked a double down the
right-field line to put runners
at second and third base. After
Drake struck out, O'Neill laced
a two-out, two-run single to left
field. Those runs would be all
Michigan needed for the rest of
the day, but the trio wasn't fin-
ished.
With two outs in the seventh
inning and Michigan's lead cut
to 2-1, Biondi walked. He then
stole second before scoring on
a left-field single by Drake, pro-
viding the Wolverines with an
insurance run.
"Obviously there are roles

there," O'Neill said. "Patrick's
job is to get on (base) - get hit,
get a hit or walk. With the way
Will puts the ball in play, he's
just trying to move him over ...
and then obviously my job is to
drive (Patrick) in. I think we did
a really nice job of knowing our
roles today and executing our
roles."
Later, with the bases load-
ed and two outs in the eighth
inning, Biondi batted in two
runs when he roped a double
down the right-field line.
With his two hits against the
Golden Grizzlies (3-17), Biondi
prolonged his hitting streak to
seven games. During his streak,
he has batted 13-for-24 and has
walked eight times, collecting
eight runs and five RBIs. And
in the last four games, Biondi's
batting average has skyrock-
eted from .243 to .307. Before
he struck out in the fifth inning,
the center fielder had reached
base on 10-consecutive plate
appearances.
"That's what you need from
your leadoff hitter," Maloney
said after Biondi went 4-for-5
against IPFW on Sunday. "He
needs to be the table setter, and
that's what will help change
this team."
But as much as Maloney is
impressed with the production
of Biondi, Drake and O'Neill,
he's just as worried about the
lack of production from every-
one else.
"Am I concerned?" Maloney
asked. "Absolutely."
Against a mediocre pitch-
ing staff, the rest of the lineup
managed just two hits and
couldn't replicate the trio's
knack for two-out RBIs, leav-
ing men in scoring position on
.two separate occasions. In last
weekend's series against the
Mastodons, they left 22 men on
base.
"The rest of the lineup needs
to be able to get the timely hit,"
Maloney said. "If you're not
going to have a lot of opportu-
nities, you've got to make the
most of the few you have."

sophomore outfielder Nicole
Sappingfield and junior short-
stop Amy Knapp can continue
their success at the plate toward'
the bottom of the order after
combining for eight hits over
the weekend.
To Hutchins, the game plan is
simple: continue doing the same
thing.
"You've got to be able to hit
hittable pitches and have good
at-bats," Hutchins said. "We're
a very capable team."
Offense hasn't been the only
important piece to Michigan's
winning streak. Led by fresh-
man Haylie Wagner, Big Ten
Co-Pitcher of the Week, the
Wolverines have held their
opponents to eight runs during
their four-game winning streak.
Wagner carries a 1.28 ERA

into Wednesday's game and will
look to build off her latest game,
in which she struck out six bat-
ters.
Despite the momentum,
Hutchins said on Sunday that any
previous wins "have no bearing
on the next game," and Bowling
Green (15-9 overall) is no excep-
tion. The improved Falcons have
already surpassed last year's win
total (12) and have stars with both
the bat and the glove.
Bowling Green is led by soph-
omore infielder Katie Yoho, a
workhorse who leads her team in
almost every offensive category.
Yoho carries a .370 batting aver-
age and an even more impressive
.753 slugging percentage, which
has helped put her among the top
of the leaderboard in the Mid-
American Conference.
The Falcons also rely on a
freshman pitcher, Jamie Kertes, -a
to keep games close. Though her
7-4 record doesn'treflect her solid
first year, her 1.49 ERA stands out
as an indicator of her ability to get
batters out.
Bowling Green, which is 5-28 y
all-time against the Wolverines,
will have to overcome a lack
of depth in its lineup to have a
chance against Michigan's bal-
anced lineup.
Perhaps the most important
factor, though, will be Alumni
Field. The Wolverines are in
their longest home stretch and
have looked like a new team since
returning to Ann Arbor.
"Alumni Field is one of the best
college softball environments in
the country," Hutchins said. "Our
fans love us, and they can't wait to
see us play."

TEDX
From Page 5B
Is TED elitist?
In spite of its popularity, there have been
questions of whether TED - the parent con-
ference of TEDx - is an elitist event.
The TED conferences require that indi-
viduals submit an- application in order to
determine whether the participant will be
"a strong contributor to the TED community
and/or the ideas discussed at TED and/or the
projects."
And if accepted, participants must pay
a steep price to attend the conference.
Prices for access to an event range from
$995 - the base price for access to a live
webstream of the talks to one computer -
to $7,500 - the price to attend the actual
event.
These costs and the fact that the events
happen in areas far from the University -
such as California and Scotland - prohibit
the average student from affording a live
webstream, let alone attending an event.
The TED website acknowledges the
assumption that the conference might be

"There was a box of free t-shirts outside
on the third floor, and about half the crew
just grabbed one and changed because we
were all so hot and sweaty," Fisher said. "It
was funny - by the end of the night about
half the room was in the same t-shirt."
2 a.m.
The trial resumes, with Andrews offering
testimony and Bowen and his counsel esca-
lating their aggression toward him. Mays
recalls feeling secure that the trial would end
within an hour or two.
"We got into the LSA-SG and I was assum-
ing, 'OK, they're going to wrap this up, clos-
ing arguments and stuff, and then we'll be
out of here by the end of the hour,' " Mays
said. "I was certain about it."
3:30 a.m.
An hour and a half later, the UEC recess-
es to private deliberations. The time com-
pounds the onlookers' exhaustion.
After the UEC members excuse them-
selves, people begin sleeping - on couches,
on the floor and on the tables. Someone
orders a pizza, and the room empties the box
within a half-hour.
In the midst of sleeping bodies strewn on
the floor, futile attempts at late-night study-
ing and tired musings on the elections, the
word "clusterfuck" is added to the lexicon to
describe the night.
LSA junior Sean Walser, the MForward
chairman, was one of the interested parties
attending the proceedings.
"I heard (clusterfuck) a lot of times ...
Nobody really knew what was going on,"

elitist, noting that while "it certainly attracts
people who are regarded as elite in their
area of expertise ... the word 'elitist' implies
exclusionary" - not an adjective it associates
itself with.
The concept of nationwide TEDx confer-
ences was initially conceived as a way to
defray the costs of attendance. Attendees
can expect to spend about $10 for admis-
sion.
But this year presents the first year TEDx-
UofM has required from its prospective
participants a full application to attend the
conference, with questions ranging from
"what do you want to transform?" to "tell
us a story that lets us know what makes you
you."
For the event organizers, however, the
application was just a way of filtering in the
"right" kind of audience member. .
"To sum it all up, it's someone who cares
about what they're doing," Mason said.
"There is no one skill, no one project that
we're looking for. It's the idea that whatever
does interest them, they're going at it full
force."
Klaben added said that attendees need to
be "passionate about something," and they
are looking for "a really diverse group of
Walser said. "It was mass chaos."
4:30 a.m.
Food is passed around. First Swedish
Fish, then Doritos. "Call Me Maybe" plays
in the background. The theme song of "The
West Wing" starts before someone plugs
their headphones into their laptop.
5 a.m.
The UEC is still in deliberations, and
Mays and the rest of the room find their
patience disappearing.
"It just went on for so long that people
started getting cranky," Mays said. "People
were like, 'I have an exam at 10. Why don't
you just tell us the election results?' Peo-
ple were getting frustrated. I was getting
frustrated because I was thinking, 'They
could've done this tomorrow or something
like that. They could've done that later on."'
6:35 a.m.
"They're coming!" someone shouts. "... in
15 minutes."
6:50 a.nl.
Mays and Hashwi announce the UEC
has ended its deliberations. Within seconds,
Mays recalls, the room wakes up.
6:51 a.m.
The commission marches in - bloodshot
eyes, somber faces.
Borock starts to speak. He begins by tell-
ing Parikh the court is "not very happy with
your actions."
Soon after, the court unanimously votes
that Parikh had committed a "major violation"

a week of daily stories

Business junior Manish Parikh was elect-
ed Central Student Government president
after a marathon 12-hour hearing last
Thursday night.

The 15th annual University of Michi-
gan Dance Marathon raised more than
$500000 for alocal organization that pians
camping trips for sick children.

Eavesdropping on the aftermath of the Central Student Government elections
By Giacomo Bologna, Austen Hufford and Andrew Schulman

Last Wednesday, midnight
The online polls for Central Student.Gov-
ernment president, vice president, assembly
representatives and Department of Public
Safety Oversight Committee are activated.
There are six parties running for CSG presi-
dent.
Later that day-
School of Social Work student Victor
Andrews, the president of the School of Social
Work Student Union, sends out an e-mail to
21 listservs in support of Business junior
Manish Parikh and LSA sophomore Omar
Hashwi, independent candidates running for
CSG president and vice president.
LSA senior Katy Tylus of youMICH and
LSA junior Robert Bowen of OurMichigan
both file complaints with the University
Elections Commission that allege Andrews's
e-mail breaches the CSG election code
because Andrews doesn't own the listservs
that received the e-mail. The two grievances
are combined into a joint complaint against
Parikh.
Later, Andrews tells us he had no idea his
e-mail would launch the longest night in the
history of the UEC.
"I'll never send an e-mail that'll do any-
thing like that ever again," Andrews says.

is scheduled to start.
7:32 p.m.
Parikh arrives two minutes late to the
CSG offices on the third floor of the Michi-
gan Union.
Shortly after 7:32 p.m.
Andrews arrives to testify. According to
Andrews, Parikh said he would only need to
be there for less than a half-hour.
"Man, 15 to 20 minutes turned into 12
hours," Andrews tells us later.
9:49 p.m.
First-year Law student Betsy Fisher, a
friend of CSG election director Peter Borock,
also a Law student, is studying at the Law
Quadrangle when she gets a call from Borock
asking her to defend Parikh and Hashwi in a
hearing.
"I was vaguely aware that the CSG stood
for Central Student Government," Fisher
tells us. "I'd never seen the CSG elections,
certainly never the composite code with all
the election rules."
But Borock pleads with her over the
phone, swearing that the hearing could not
continue without her. Fisher relents.

members of his team are leaning over a table
strategizing.
Borock, shuttling between hearings,
hands Fisher a copy of the election code with
the provisions in question highlighted.
"Read this," Fisher recalls Borock telling
her. "I'll get back to you and tell you when
we're ready to start."
10 p.m.
The UEC, composed of Borock and Law
student Ezra Geggel, LSA senior Anne
Laverty, Business senior Matt Eral and Rack-
ham student Elson Liu, goes into the first of
two closed-door deliberations to decide the
extent of coordination between Parikh and
Andrews.
11:30 p.m.
LSA sophomore Chris Mays, a member of
MForward and a candidate in the LSA-SG
elections, arrives at the proceedings to sup-
port Hashwi.
"It was kind of like a theater," he says,
referring to how crowded the squat, square
hearing room was.
11:45 p.m.
When the UEC returns from its closed-
door deliberations, it becomes clear that the
election results will not come out at mid-
night.

11:48 p.m.
A full public hearing commences.
Andrews is called back to testify.
The commission asks for definitions and
personal accounts. It scrutinizes Parikh
and Andrews's relationship. It questions
Andrews's authority to use the listservs in
question.
Friday, 12:18 a.m.
Questions and testimonies are repeat-
edly pored over, as the UEC looks for for any
detail that could have been missed.
Andrews later told us the memory that
most stuck with him was the way he was
treated during the hearing.
"They tried to belittle my name," Andrews
said. "I didn't like that."
1:45 a.m.
The hearing is still in full force.
CSG program manager Anika Awai-Wil-
liams announces that the hearing will need
to move to LSA-SG's offices in Mason Hall
because the Union closes at 2 a.m.
1:47 a.m
With a brief respite for chatter, UEC,
Parikh and the prosecution pack up. In the
hallway outside the hearing room, Parikh,
Fisher and their team swipe gray T-shirts
from a box on the floor and don them for the

do the wobble
[stausupdate] by jordan rochelson
Why should a University student participate in
Dance Marathon?
They get a chance to be involved in on organization that
has both a social and philanthropic function.
What was the craziest dance you saw . at the
marathon?
Well, it's not crazy, but the Central Planning Team
got to go on stage and lead all the dancers in "The
Wobble." I'm not sure if you're familiar, but it's kind of
sweeping the campus right now.
What is your personal goal for DMUM?
That we spread further in the community.
What decade would you have like to been born in?
I'm watching this show right now called "Downton
Abbey." I love that decade.

The University's School of Music, Theatre

week. The festival featured original works by
six University students.
