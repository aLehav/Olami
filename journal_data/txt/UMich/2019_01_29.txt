Around 8 p.m. on Monday 
night, the Michigan Student 
Power Network created a petition 
called 
#UMichColdShoulder 
demanding the University of 
Michigan cancel classes.
“The University of Michigan 
- 
Ann 
Arbor 
must 
close 
campus during harsh weather 
conditions - not just in extreme 
circumstances,” 
the 
petition 
reads. “A refusal to do so 
is classist and ableist, with 
disproportionate 
effects 
on 
workers, low income community 
members, 
and 
community 
members who are not able-

bodied.”
The petition calls for students 
to email and call University 
President Mark Schlissel as well 
as sign the petition. As of 10 
p.m Monday night — about two 
hours after its creation — the 
petition had 2,236 signatures.
Students say they’re cold and 
upset
The 
petition 
came 
after 
students trudged through deep 
snow in an effort to make it to 
class on Monday. U-M students 
felt the effects of Winter Storm 
Jayden, facing a day of constant 
snow that accumulated quickly 
on University sidewalks and 
streets. The weather conditions 
caused many students to question 

the 
University’s 
decision 
to 
remain fully operational.
According to the National 
Weather 
Service, 
a 
winter 
weather advisory was put into 
effect for the Ann Arbor area at 
4:30 p.m. Monday. The advisory 
predicted two to four inches of 
snow to accumulate throughout 
the day.
LSA junior Rylei McAllister 
took to Facebook to express her 
opinions on the University not 
canceling classes on Monday.
“I 
understand 
why 
the 
University doesn’t cancel classes 
for weather,” McAllister wrote. 
“But think of the kids who are 
already at a disadvantage because 
they are struggling to afford to 

go here and are expected to walk 
long distances.”
Over 
the 
weekend, 
the 
University sent out multiple 
warnings regarding the severe 
cold, 
detailing 
remaining 
outside in subzero temperatures 
could result in frostbite in less 
than 10 minutes.
“The university released a 
statement telling these same 
students they will get frostbite if 
they are outside for longer than 
ten minutes,” McAllister wrote. 
“But (the administration) knows 
misses (sic) classes can mean a 
lower grade for attendance and 
participation, which financial 
aid rides on.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Amid 
growing 
concerns 
over the lack of transgender 
voices in conversations about 
coverage plans, University of 
Michigan graduate employees 
met with human resources 
representatives 
and 
the 

MHealthy Advisory Committee 
Friday to urge the University 
to 
cover 
gender-affirming 
surgeries.
Members of the Graduate 
Employee 
Organization’s 
Trans Health Caucus discussed 
potential 
improvement 
to 
GradCare, a healthcare plan for 
University graduate students 

that covers most transgender 
surgeries yet deems certain 
ones, such as facial feminization 
surgery, as cosmetic and not 
medically necessary. 
The conference was closed to 
the public, yet more than 50 GEO 
members and allies lined the 
hallways of Wolverine Tower 
holding signs of support that 

read “Are you ready to listen?” 
and “Our lives are not cosmetic.”
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the goal of the 
conference was for members 
of HR to better understand the 
perspectives and experiences 
of the Trans Health Caucus’ 
members.

On 
Monday, 
the 
Ford 
School of Public Policy hosted 
an event featuring Manny 
Teodoro, 
director 
of 
the 
Policy and Politics Program 
and associate professor at 
Texas A&M University, who 
has 
conducted 
significant 
research on the nation’s water 
systems. 
The 
event, 
titled 
“Water System Finance: the 
Political Pitfalls of Public-
Private Partnerships,” covered 
the effects of public-private 
partnerships on water systems.
Teodoro started his talk by 
introducing a unique caveat 
in the water market — the 
disparity in the visibility of the 
price of water and its quality 
in the market.
“With 
water, 
the 
cost 
is much more visible than 
quality,” Teodoro said. “Most 
of the contaminants in water 
are invisible to us. However, 
the price of water is very easily

On Friday, President Donald 
Trump passed a continuing 
resolution 
proposed 
by 
Congress 
announcing 
the 
federal 
government 
would 
reopen for three weeks while 
negotiations over immigration 
policy continue.
Since the initial shutdown 
on Dec. 22, the absence of 
government 
funding 
has 
impacted 
several 
programs 
and 
departments 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
specifically publicly funded 
research projects and other 
areas dependent on federal 
government support.
Another affected group at 
the University has been the 
Public 
Service 
Internship 
Program, or PSIP. Each year, 
the program accepts more 
than 100 students interested in 
government work, preparing 
them for summer internships 
in Washington, D.C.

On Monday at approximately 
2:30 p.m., a Bursley-Baits bus 
accident 
occurred 
at 
1100 
Block Fuller Road, according to 
Melissa Overton, deputy chief 
of police & public information 
officer for the University of 
Michigan Police Department. 
About 
20 
passengers 
were 
aboard the bus and there were 
no reported injuries.
“(The bus) slid off the road 
crashed into a small tree,” 
Overton wrote in an email 
response to The Daily.
Public 
Health 
senior 
Olajumoke Jegede was on the 
bus when the accident occurred. 
Jegede told The Daily in a 
statement she fell out of her seat 
and was afraid the bus would tip 
over.
“Our bus hit a tree. It was 
scary because we were afraid 
the bus would tip over for a 
moment,” Jegede wrote. “I had 
fallen out of my seat whn the bus 
spun out and when I got back 
up, we were facing traffic on 
the side of the road, thankfully, 
and the windshield was cracked. 
Thankfully no one was hurt, but 
someone definitely could have 
been. I think there needs to be 
more consideration for students 

and other commuters in terms 
of travelling to class in weather 
like this.”
LSA sophomore Juliana Rose 
was on a different Bursley-Baits 
bus, which passed the scene of 
the accident earlier today. Rose 
said she saw police cars and tow 
trucks near the bus, and traffic 
was moving slowly in the area 
surrounding the crash.
“We just saw it on the side 
of the road,” Rose said. “There 
were tow trucks, police cars, 
all the traffic is moving slow 
… I was like, ‘Oh wow, I hope 
that doesn’t happen to me. I 
don’t want to be stuck out in the 
snow.’ (Our bus) was sliding a 
little bit when we were turning 
corners.”
LSA sophomore Grace Miller 
was on a Commuter North bus, 
which was stopped just before 
the crash. Miller watched tow 
trucks pull the bus back onto 
the street and said there were 
students, faculty and hospital 
workers on her bus, which 
stopped for approximately 10 
minutes.
“We’re really quiet but this 
one lady asked to get off because 
we’re literally not moving,” 
Miller said. “We’re just stopped. 
People are trying to get home 
from work before it gets worse.

On Monday evening, Carrie 
Bishop, chief digital services 
officer for the City and County 
of San Francisco, spoke on 
promoting 
technological 
change in government at the 
Ford School of Public Policy. 
The talk was co-sponsored 
by the Public Policy School’s 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Public Policy program and 
the School of Information.
Bishop 
moved 
to 
San 
Francisco from the United 
Kingdom 
in 
2017. 
Before 
coming to the U.S., Bishop 
worked for local government 
for 
four 
years 
until 
she 
helped create FutureGov, a 
design consulting and service 
company. Bishop currently 
works with improving the 
web services provided by the 

city of San Francisco to be 
more user-friendly. She is a 
part of an effort to make all 
city forms available to users 
online.
“We know if something’s 
not 
aligned 
within 
an 
organization as a customer, 
and I think that is becoming 
more and more prevalent,” 
Bishop 
said. 
“We 
need 
to 
think 
about 
customer 
experience as the entire end-
to-end, not just the bit that 
people experience when they 
call us or when they come on 
our website.”
Bishop 
explained 
the 
three 
levels 
of 
media 
change as transformational, 
transactional 
and 
tweaks. 
She said tweaks are small 
changes made to websites 
while transactional changes 
make 
the 
websites 
easier 
for 
individuals 
to 
engage 

within a complex system. 
Transformational 
changes 
fundamentally alter the use 
of the media service.
In addition to speaking 
about the levels of media 
change, 
Bishop 
discussed 
four main models for change 
in government media.. Each 
model has an increasingly 
higher 
level 
of 
financial 
risk and more expenses, but 
Bishop said she has seen all 
models 
result 
in 
positive 
changes.
By the time she is finished 
in 
San 
Francisco, 
Bishop 
hopes to have all city forms 
available to residents online. 
Her team is currently creating 
forms that will eventually 
allow cannabis distributors 
to 
register 
their 
business 
online 
and 
affordable 
housing applicants to submit 
their 
applications 
directly 
through the city website. 
Bishop said this enables 
accessibility to those who 
may have trouble traveling 
to the location of the city 
department 
to 
turn 
in 
forms on time.
“We’re 
trying 
our 
hardest to address income 
disparity 
through 
our 
work by making sure that 
everything we’re designing 
is fully inclusive,” Bishop 
said. “For example, a lot 
of 
people 
think 
about 
accessibility as a disability, 
but I would encourage you 
to widen your perspective 
and think about it across 
the board. So not just 
making 
sure 
that 
our 
website is ADA (Americans 
with 
Disabilities 
Act)-
compliant 
and 
fully 
accessible to people with 
screen readers, but going 
beyond that to things like 
language access.”
In five years, Bishop said 
she is aiming for her team 
and job to be irrelevant. 
She said she wants the 
city and department to be 

able to organize city forms 
themselves.
“Don’t ever think that if 
you’re on a project redesigning 
a form for government that 
your work is unimportant 
because you are just designing 
a form, because this changes 
people’s lives,” Bishop said. 
“The idea of a form is that 
it applies consistency and 
fairness to a process. We’re 
asking everyone for the same 
information, we’re putting 
them all through the same 
process. Forms are incredibly 
integral within government 
as an idea of fairness.”
Amelia Esenstad, a Public 
Policy graduate student, said 
she learned the importance of 
digitizing government forms 
from Bishop’s presentation.
“I thought the talk was 
very interesting because it 
is a good reminder of the 
importance of changing how 
government works and serves 
its residents to address a lot 
of the really challenging, 
difficult policy problems that 
government has designed to 
be helping with,” Esenstad 
said. “I think more cities and 
states should be doing similar 
work to what San Francisco is 
doing.”
U-M alum Harsha Devaraj 
said 
he 
enjoyed 
learning 
about the fairness of forms. 
Bishop’s new definition of 
digital 
media 
influenced 
Devaraj’s thoughts of media 
services.
“I 
liked 
the 
general 
definition 
of 
new 
digital 
services 
because 
it’s 
responding to 21st-century 
tools,” 
Devaraj 
said. 
“Initially, we used to think 
of customer services being in 
the front end and everything 
else was pushed to the back, 
but thinking about customer 
services as being the whole 
package, because people feel 
the impact of the whole thing, 
should all be part of that 
definition.”

and readily observable.”

As such, Teodoro argued if 
a water system is run by the 
local government, then it will 
naturally focus on reducing 
the price of water to appease 
residents — a stance that will 
also inadvertently lead to lower 
water quality.
“The goal of every politician 
who wants to get re-elected 
wants to minimize price and 
maximize quality,” Teodoro 
said. “However, because of 
how much more visible prices 
are than quality for water, the 
long-run outcome is low prices 
and low quality.”

Alternatively, 
in 
private-
run water systems, the price 
companies 
are 
allowed 
to 
charge for water is limited by 
how much they invest in their 
water infrastructure, which is 
a limit enforced by the public 
utilities commission. Because 
of this, they are incentivized 
to over-invest in their water 
infrastructure, which will lead 
to high quality water but also 
high prices.
“The goal of every company 
is to make profit,” Teodoro said. 
“As such, they are incentivized 
to maximize investment so that 
the public utilities commission 
will allow them to raise prices 
in 
conjunction 
with 
their 
higher investments. As such, 
private water tends to be high 
price and high quality.”

However, 
Teodoro 
also 
argued 
public-private 
partnerships 
are 
not 
the 
solution to this dilemma.
“In 
public-private 
partnerships, 
the 
local 
government 
sets 
the 
price 
for the water and the private 
company has to figure out 
how to maximize its profits 
within that,” Teodoro said. “As 
such, the incentive for these 
private companies is to reduce 
operating costs. This results in 
low-priced water but also low-
quality water.”
Furthermore, 
Teodoro 
disputed the perception that 
public-private 
partnerships 
are a solution for financially 
constrained 
water 
markets, 
emphasizing 
how 
they 
are 
a 
mechanism, 
not 
a 
self-

sufficient source of revenue.
“Privatization 
of 
public 
partnerships are not sources 
of capital. In the end, the 
money’s 
coming 
from 
the 
same people,” Teodoro said. 
“The rate increases are still 
going to be needed to upgrade 
infrastructure, or else they will 
continue to fail.”
After the talk, Sheny Puspita, 
a 
Public 
Policy 
graduate 
student, reflected on her views 
of the water systems and her 
main takeaways from the talk.
She discussed how more 
successful systems tend to be 
small, privately-owned water 
plants, but improvements are 
needed in larger, public water 
systems.
“The private-owned model 
only works with small-scale 

water plants, but we need to 
improve number of larger-scale 
water plants,” Puspita said.
Puspita also acknowledged 
private water plants do tend to 
produce higher quality water 
and operate more efficiently.
“I believe that private water 
plants will enhance the quality 
of water and efficiency of water 
plants,” she said.
Puspita spoke of her concern 
of how politicians would use 
public-private partnerships to 
shield themselves away from 
their responsibility for their 
constituencies’ water systems.
Marc Jaruzel, a Public Policy 
graduate 
student, 
 
echoed 
some of the skepticism for 
public-private 
water 
system 
partnerships.
“Public-private partnerships 

aren’t 
necessarily 
the 
fix-
all,” Jaruzel said. “There is 
some evidence that it may be 
beneficial, but we just can’t say 
definitively whether P3s will 
be beneficial or not.”
Jaruzel commented on how 
having competing public water 
systems would not be a feasible 
solution either.
“I think public competition 
would be really challenging 
because you would have to 
have different pipes laying 
in the ground from different 
companies,” Jaruzel said. “I 
think it would take a really 
creative solution to get utilities 
to compete in a similar way as 
other businesses.”

And think of the students 
with disabilities or injuries that 
are going to have a hard time 
getting to and from classes this 
week.”
In an interview with The 
Daily, 
McAllister 
said 
she 
understands 
the 
difficult 
logistics 
behind 
canceling 
classes, 
but 
the 
University 
should 
take 
the 
safety 
of 
students and staff into account.
“I think there’s a biased 
assumption that all students live 
very centrally … close to the Diag 
and so it’s not that big of a deal if 
there are bad conditions because 
it’s not that far to go, but that’s 
not the case,” McAllister said. 
“I think that in the mix of it, we 
forget about students who live 
off campus or far from campus 
and have to commute; their 
lives are put in danger by having 
to drive in these conditions. 
Students who are disabled have 

to find a way to get to campus 
through all of the mess as well.”
LSA junior Iman Elkahlah 
lives about 15 minutes away 
and commutes to campus. She 
said the University should value 
safety over classes as the roads 
she takes to get to school are not 
fully cleared of snow.
“I’m debating whether I’ll be 
able to go to class or not because 
my safety is my number one 
priority,” Elkahlah said. “The 
campus roads are clean, but the 
roads in downtown Ann Arbor 
are harsh. They are not taking 
into consideration the roads to 
come here.”
When asked about taking 
disabled and commuter students 
into consideration, the Office 
of Public Affairs declined to 
comment.
Blue busses face difficulties
The University of Michigan 
Campus Bus System Facebook 
page posted Saturday about the 
predicted hazardous weather 
conditions in the coming week. 
The post advised students of 

possible bus delays and warned 
of the chance of frostbite after 10 
minutes of exposed skin under 
the current weather conditions.
On Monday afternoon, a Blue 
Bus slid off the road and hit a 
nearby tree.
Stephen 
Dolen, 
executive 
director 
of 
logistics, 
transportation 
and 
parking 
at the University, said the 
department is working to ensure 
buses run on schedule in this 
week’s snowy weather. He said 
there is an additional challenge 
making sure enough staff is 
able to safely get to work, and 
the department is trying their 
best to get as many overtime 
volunteers as possible.
“Any weather event has a 
huge impact on transit,” Dolen 
said. “Things are going slower, 
and our drivers are directed to 
not take any additional chances 
because they are trying to stay 
on time. When it comes to days 
like this, you have to be safe and 
do the best you can to stay as 
on time as possible. We’re very

close for inclimate weather
Multiple services and events 
on campus were closed or 
rescheduled Monday. The LSA 
Social Impact Fair, originally 
scheduled for Monday evening, 
was rescheduled for March 
11. 
Center 
for 
Global 
and 
Intercultural Study closed at 
3 p.m. and moved a First Step 
session to Tuesday afternoon. 
The 
Fishbowl 
closed 
early 
Monday 
afternoon 
due 
to 
weather-based student safety 
concerns, and Espresso Royale 
on South University Avenue 
closed early at 8 p.m. 
U-M Dearborn and U-M Flint 
both closed on Jan. 28. Eastern 
Michigan University canceled 
classes Jan. 28, and Wayne 
State University will close at 
4 p.m. on Tuesday and reopen 
on Thursday. An additional 72 
public schools in the Metro 
Detroit area are scheduled to 
close Tuesday.

Michigan’s state government 
offices in the Lower Peninsula 
also 
shut 
down 
due 
to 
emergency 
snow 
conditions 
Monday morning. Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer issued a statement 
saying the offices plan to reopen 
Tuesday.
“This is about keeping all 
Michiganders safe,” Whitmer 
wrote in the statement. “All 
motorists are encouraged to stay 
off of the roads. If you must be 
out, please drive safely in these 
dangerous weather conditions 
and be respectful of road crews 
working to clear snow and ice.”
University to monitor weather 
conditions
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
said 
the 
University is paying attention 
to the current situation. Going 
forward, 
Broekhuizen 
said 
administrators 
will 
make 
decisions 
about 
canceling 
classes accordingly.
“The university is closely 
monitoring 
the 
weather 
forecast for later this week,” 

Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily.
Regardless of the University’s 
official decision, some students 
are considering staying home in 
the coming days as temperatures 
are 
predicted 
to 
plummet. 
Engineering sophomore Jake 
Kovalic said none of his classes 
have been canceled, but he 
thinks 
the 
snowy 
and 
icy 
conditions will have an impact 
on campus operations. A low 
temperature 
of 
negative 
17 
degrees Fahrenheit is predicted 
for Wednesday with possible 
wind chills as low as 40 degrees 
below 
zero 
Tuesday 
night 
through 
Thursday 
morning, 
according 
to 
the 
National 
Weather Service.
“Last week it was very icy, 
and at least one of the days, 
every surface was iced,” Kovalic 
said. “I would hope they cancel 
classes. I’ll see how the weather 
is on Wednesday, but I might not 
go either way.”

Enrolled 
students 
are 
frequently put in contact with 
employers on Capitol Hill, the 
Smithsonian and within the 
federal bureaucracy.
According 
to 
PSIP 
Supervisor 
Lynn 
Halton, 
also an alum of the program, 
PSIP sees students all the 
way through the internship 
application 
process, 
and 
provides further guidance and 
accommodations once students 
begin their summer work.
“Once 
they’re 
hired 
for 
internships in D.C., they have 
housing, 
we 
connect 
them 
up with one-on-one alumni 
mentors and we plan policy 
talks and social events for 
them,” Halton said.
For undergraduates enrolled 
in 
PSIP, 
the 
first 
several 

months of the year are typically 
when internship applications 
open up and students begin 
looking into job opportunities. 
Due to the shutdown, Halton 
and other faculty advisors have 
been forced to contend with the 
difficulty of communicating 
with employers in the public 
sector.
“There isn’t staff there,” she 
said. “For the agencies that are 
closed, there is no one there 
to answer. If someone sends 
a resume, we don’t know if 
they’ve received it. The process 
has definitely been slowed by 
that.”
Ben Schuster, a Business 
sophomore in PSIP, has already 
submitted several applications 
through 
the 
University 
program. Schuster hopes to 
secure an internship in the 
Federal Reserve, a policy think 
tank or on Capitol Hill in the 
office of a U.S. senator.

“I’ve applied to a few places, 
and I haven’t heard back from 
one of them yet,” Schuster said. 
“It’s a little concerning, but it’s 
understandable.”
Schuster 
thinks 
this 
lack of response is because 
maintaining 
internship 
programs is not necessarily the 
top priority for the countless 
government 
agencies 
PSIP 
partners 
with. 
Even 
with 
the newly passed continuing 
resolution, it still may take 
some time for agencies to pick 
up their work at full capacity.
Furthermore, 
it 
remains 
unclear 
if 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans will come to an 
agreement within the three-
week 
time 
period, 
failure 
of which would result in a 
continued shutdown.
Because of this, Schuster 
explains, many of his peers 
have had to work around gaps 
in the system to ensure their 

applications reach the proper 
employers in Washington, D.C.
“One of my friends knew a 
woman who had a connection 
to a certain agency that he 
wanted to work for,” Schuster 
explained. 
“She 
attempted 
to go into the agency’s site to 
let people know that he was 
applying, and she was unable 
to do that because of the 
shutdown. It’s small things like 
that. And in terms of priorities, 
when the government shuts 
down, it’s more important to 
make sure workers are getting 
paid.”
Another 
PSIP 
student, 
LSA 
sophomore 
Maeve 
Skelly, 
echoed 
Schuster’s 
disillusionment 
with 
the 
difficulty of communicating 
with employers in the public 
sector.
“There’s definitely been a 
slowdown in terms of response 
time,” Skelly said. “A lot of 

students will email government 
programs about an internship 
and not hear back for a longer 
period of time.”
Nonetheless, during the last 
month, Halton and other faculty 
coordinators at PSIP were able 
to work around obstacles posed 
by the shutdown through the 
program’s numerous contacts 
in Washington, D.C.
Perhaps the most helpful 
resource for PSIP students has 
been the program’s connections 
with alumni. According to 
Halton, during the last 50 
years, a number of bureaucrats, 
politicians and public-sector 
employers have passed through 
PSIP as undergraduates at the 
University of Michigan.
“There 
are 
two 
representatives in the U.S. 
House that are Michigan PSIP 
alums: 
Lauren 
Underwood 
from Illinois and Ted Deutch 
from Florida,” Halton said. 

“I’ve been in contact with both 
of their chiefs of staff and been 
trying to connect up so our 
students could be there. They 
both say that them being in 
public policy and the public 
arena has evolved from being 
in our program.”
Despite the uncertainty and 
obstacles 
faced 
during 
the 
last month, Halton remains 
optimistic. As she explains, the 
experience of working through 
roadblocks 
in 
government 
should be seen as a lesson for 
undergraduates heading down 
a career path in public service.
“From a career perspective, 
I think it is a good point 
for students to realize that 
working in the private sector 
is different from working in 
the 
public 
sector,” 
Halton 
said. “It’s kind of a learning 
opportunity to realize when 
you’re a public servant, things 
can be different — these things 

“One of the purposes of 
the 
special 
conference 
on 
Friday was to hear directly 
from GEO members about this 
topic,” Fitzgerald said. “The 
University acknowledges the 
courage and commitment of 
those who shared their stories 
Friday afternoon and these 
stories have helped to inform 
the process in a productive 
way.”
In 
April 
2017, 
members 
of the Trans Health Caucus 
threatened to walk out of 
contract 
negotiations 
with 
HR due to inadequate trans 
healthcare coverage. Since, the 
Trans Health Caucus and HR 
have been engaged in a series 
of special conferences as part 
of the collective bargaining 
process to address the GEO’s 
demands.
In March 2018, the GEO 
also raised awareness about 
trans 
healthcare 
coverage 
by hosting a Trans Day of 
Disposability rallyin the Diag. 
The conferences and rally put 
pressure on the University to 
adapt their policies related to 
gender transition procedures, 
but many Trans Health Caucus 
members said they still felt 
unheard and ignored by HR.
Ansel Neunzert, Rackham 
student and GEO member, 
stood 
outside 
of 
Friday’s 

special conference in support 
of the Trans Health Caucus. 
They said they hoped the 
conference 
would 
force 
University 
officials 
to 
acknowledge the experience 
of trans students when making 
decisions 
about 
healthcare 
coverage.
“I really hope that today 
they’re going to hear from a lot 
of trans people about the ways 
that this stuff impacts them, 
and get a sense of the fact that 
this isn’t an abstract discussion 
about the University’s bottom 
line — this is people’s lives,” 
Neunzert said. “I think it’s 
really valuable to get that 
first-hand information in a 
way that I don’t think HR and 
the MBAC (Medical Benefit 
Advisory 
Committee) 
have 
heard yet.”
According to Monica Lewis, 
Rackham student and chair of 
the Trans Health Caucus, the 
University agreed to convene 
every four months to discuss 
transgender 
healthcare 
coverage but has missed the 
deadline 
to 
arrange 
these 
meetings twice since April 
2018. 
“One of the major red flags 
that they weren’t taking this 
seriously was that there was a 
contractual deadline violation, 
namely 
literally 
the 
only 
stipulation in the contract 
that sets out rules for these 
meetings is that we have to 
meet every four months, and 

they missed the four-month 
deadline,” 
Lewis 
said. 
“In 
September, they missed the 
four-month deadline again. I 
think it was kind of over the 
summer of 2018 that we were 
like, yeah, this is not going 
anywhere and we’re going 
to have to get a little more 
aggressive with them.”
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen said the 
University is still discussing 
the healthcare concerns with 
GEO.
“We have been meeting with 
GEO in good faith to discuss 
and review our transgender 
benefits,” Broekhuizen wrote.
Though asked about missing 
the 
four-month 
deadline 
for 
transgender 
healthcare, 
Kim did not comment on the 
allegation from Lewis.
To 
provide 
HR 
representatives 
with 
the 
medical background needed 
to participate in the special 
conferences, 
the 
University 
called two MBAC meetings 
in June and October 2018. 
The meetings, which were 
led by Philip Zazove, chair 
of 
Family 
Medicine 
at 
Michigan Medicine, aimed to 
discuss healthcare coverage 
with 
medical 
professionals 
and advise HR about what 
procedures to cover under 
GradCare. 
Zazove did not respond to 
request for comment.
Lewis said the details of 

these 
meetings 
were 
not 
immediately 
available 
to 
the 
Trans 
Health 
Caucus, 
and the board members had 
little experience with trans 
healthcare 
before 
making 
their recommendations.
“The kind of people who 
were on this coverage review 
were 
primarily 
old-school 
physicians who don’t have any 
specialization in trans care 
whatsoever,” Lewis said. “So a 
bunch of cis people are going to 
meet behind closed doors and 
decide whether or not they feel 
these transition procedures 
are cosmetic and we don’t get 
any say in the matter?”
Fitzgerald 
said 
while 
the 
University 
is 
still 
in 
the 
process 
of 
negotiating 
more extensive transgender 
healthcare 
with 
the 
GEO, 
GradCare coverage includes 
many 
gender-affirming 
surgeries and is on par with 
most public institutions.
“The University’s coverage 
of gender-affirming services 
meets or exceeds that currently 
offered by the majority of our 
national 
peer 
institutions,” 
Fitzgerald said.
Lewis 
and 
Morgan 
Whitcomb, Rackham student 
and member of the Trans 
Health Caucus, said they took 
issue with how University 
officials seemed to exclude 
trans voices from the MBAC 
meetings and comply with 
insurance 
policies 
that 
do 

not 
cover 
gender-affirming 
surgeries.
According to MBAC meeting 
notes from June 2018 the 
Trans Health Caucus obtained 
through 
the 
Freedom 
of 
Information Act and given 
to The Daily, the Michigan 
Medicine plastic surgery team 
deemed 
facial 
feminization 
and 
chondrolaryngoplasty 
(Adam’s 
apple 
reduction) 
medically necessary, but the 
insurance 
providers 
Blue 
Cross Blue Shield and Blue 
Care Network of Michigan 
identified them as cosmetic. 
Whitcomb said the lack of 
trans people present in MBAC 
meetings contributed to this 
discrepancy.
“They 
don’t 
want 
to 
acknowledge that trans people 
are 
experts 
in 
their 
own 
healthcare,” Whitcomb said. 
“They have this disconnect 
of ‘Well, there’s like doctors 
have trained for this.’ The 
difference 
is 
they 
haven’t 
trained to be experts in trans 
care — they’re experts in 
other fields and they’re trying 
to apply that knowledge to 
a different community and 
problem without consulting 
the community.”
The Trans Health Caucus 
has received support from 
transgender students, allies 
and 
the 
Rackham 
Student 
Government 
since 
the 
first special conference in 
December 2017. In a November 

2018 letter obtained by The 
Daily that GEO sent to MBAC 
with 
419 
signatures, 
the 
organization urged MBAC to 
“act with compassion to those 
over whom you currently wield 
significant power.” 
On 
Dec. 
13, 
2018, 
the 
RSG 
unanimously 
passed 
a resolution in support of 
expanding GradCare coverage 
for gender-affirming surgery. 
10 representatives abstained 
from the vote.
Friday’s special conference, 
which included a personal 
perspectives 
section 
where 
Trans Health Caucus members 
recounted their experiences 
with 
gender 
dysphoria, 
persuaded HR to cover fertility 
preservation under GradCare. 
Lewis said that while it was a 
victory for the Trans Health 
Caucus, the process to achieve 
it was a difficult one with more 
work to be done.
“It 
sucks 
that 
some 
people have to talk about 
suicidal 
ideation 
with 
HR 
representatives in order to 
get healthcare,” Lewis said. 
“And it sucks that that’s where 
we are at in the process, is 
that is talking about graphic 
descriptions 
of 
gender 
dysphoria with HR and MBAC. 
It sucks that that’s what it 
took, but if that’s what makes 
progress, hopefully we don’t 
have to do it again.”

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“

Thank you for sharing,” the 
class would say in robotic 
unison. 
The 
disgruntled 

student would then 
proceed to sit down 
back in the circle 
and await the next 
brave soul to share 
their feelings aloud 
with the class.

Yes, 
this 
was 

how 
we 
spent 

every 
Wednesday 

afternoon 
in 
my 

fourth-grade 
classroom. 
Sitting 

cross-legged on the faded navy 
carpet by the windows, we, at 
the young age of 10, became 
accustomed to bearing ourselves 
and our feelings in a way that 
many 
college 
students, 
and 

beyond, are incapable of. We 
would sit and practice this open 
form of emotional expression 
and receive an automated but 
valuable sense of validation from 
our peers.

As I eventually graduated 

past this judgment-free haven, 
I grew to understand that this 
candidness about how we feel 
is frowned upon. We live in 
a society in which emotional 
expression is a sign of being 
incapable, 
or 
something 

burdensome for those around us. 
We are expected to operate under 
a guise of happiness and positivity 
and feel obligated to apologize 
for anything else. Personally, I 
have become so accustomed to 
following my emotional tangents 
with the phrase, “I am so sorry,” 
instead of taking the time to 
acknowledge how I actually feel.

As 
college 
students, 
this 

detrimental 
attitude 
toward 

showing 
emotion 
has 
been 

amplified by the hyper-connected, 
high-stress 
environment 
we 

find ourselves in. We are always 

expected to be prepared and 
pleasant and to put our best face 
forward. We are expected to 

operate as young adults 
— assertive, driven and 
willing — and failing to 
be anything but would 
deem us incapable. This 
amalgamation of great 
pressure and societal 
expectation has created 
a stigma around being 
anything but one who 
operates on a solely 
positive autopilot.

Has 
emotional 

expression become synonymous 
with 
weakness? 
Yes. 

Wholeheartedly, I would argue 
that it has. What if we were to say 
that we actually were not okay 
when someone asked? Would we 
become initially embarrassed 
for stepping into taboo territory, 
or immediately apologize? What 
if crying became something to 
be proud of? What if it became 
an emotional release instead of 
a sign of vulnerability? This is 
not something there is a general 
cure-all for, as it evidently has 
larger 
societal 
implications. 

This fear of being vulnerable 
exists in all avenues of my life.

The other night, a friend of 

mine broke down with tears 
welling in her eyes because of 
the pressure she feels regarding 
what she wants to do with her 
life. Instead of allowing herself 
to wallow and then begin the 
process of validating her feelings, 
she 
apologized 
to 
me, 
the 

consoler. In class, coincidentally 
on the same day, my professor 
shared an anecdote about how 
a presidential hopeful in the 
past faced dismal numbers after 
being crucified in the press 
for allegedly crying during a 
public address on an incredibly 
personal subject. This reticence 

to show how we feel due to fear 
of breaking social norms or 
facing societal ridicule has taken 
a toll on our collective emotional 
wellbeing.

As a new semester takes hold 

— accompanied by stressors 
and pressures old and familiar 
— I bring a personal challenge 
to the table. Despite believing 
New Year’s resolutions to be 
absolutely pointless, I find 
now to be the time more than 
ever to work toward individual 
change. I challenge myself to be 
okay with discomfort; to allow 
myself to be upset; to show 
that maybe I am not always the 
passionate, attentive individual 
that students at the University 
of Michigan are expected to be. 
Yes, crying in the UGLi may be 
considered taboo, but so what? 
Sometimes I do not have the will 
to keep everything all zipped 
up — waiting to be expressed 
in a grand, incredibly private, 
outpouring of stale emotion. I 
challenge myself to challenge 
those around me as well.

I am not going to blatantly 

share how I feel to anyone 
I meet, but work to become 
comfortable with the discomfort 
and break the mold that society 
sees fit for us. I want to change 
the 
conversation 
around 

expressing how we feel, from 
something that is considered a 
weakness to just something. I 
want to change the conversation 
from every second thought 
being inherently apologetic, to 
accepting. I challenge us all to 
shift the dialogue surrounding 
emotional vulnerability from an 
“I’m sorry,” to a “Thank you for 
sharing,” as that’s how it should 
be.

Thank you for sharing

Widen the scope of sexual education

M

y sophomore year of 

high school, a guest 

speaker came to talk 

to us in our health class. She put a 

Hershey’s Kiss on each of our desks 

and told us that we could eat it 

whenever we wanted: now, later, or 

even with lunch! At this juncture, I 

opened mine up and popped it right 

into my mouth. She then proceeded 

to show us a PowerPoint detailing 

various STIs and how each of them 

could ruin our lives, how having 

multiple sexual partners would 

increase our risk of contracting 

an STI tenfold and how condoms 

were not 100 percent guaranteed 

to work, so why would we even 

be thinking about sex outside 

of marriage? Processing all this 

information, my classmates and 

I packed up our things to head 

to our next block. As I put my 

notebook back into my bag, she 

left us these parting words: “Oh, 

and for those of you who didn’t 

eat that Hershey’s Kiss just yet: 

Doesn’t it feel good to wait?”

Not to be dramatic, but 

thinking about that makes me 

feel terrible to this day. That 

little spiel — the little comment 

about 
the 
Hershey’s 
Kiss 
I 

couldn’t keep myself from eating 
— made up the entirety of my 

high school sex education. I was 

15 at an all-girls Catholic school 

who barely interacted with any 

boys. I wasn’t “sexually active” 

and 
was 
probably 
nowhere 

near ready to be, but I still felt 

disgusting and guilty for having 

eaten that Hershey’s Kiss and 

for not waiting. There are a lot 

of things that I loved about my 

high school, but it was Catholic 

and 
predominantly 
pro-life, 

which made it near impossible 

to talk about sex, sexuality and 

reproductive 
rights 
without 

sparking 
great 
controversy 

among the militantly pro-life 

crowd. And in this current time 

period, I wish I had received 

a little more guidance. I wish 

I 
could 
have 
had 
guidance 

when navigating the world of 

contraception. I wish I could 

have had an adult to talk to 

whom I trusted, someone who 

had told me that I didn’t need to 

be ashamed of my body and my 

choices; someone to hold my hand 

and walk me through the process; 

someone who could give me an 

honest and frank education. I 

wish I had someone with me 

at Planned Parenthood when I 

started crying while trying to 

get birth control because I was 

overwhelmed and I had no idea 

what my options were or what 

to do. I am eternally grateful to 

the friend who came with me to 

Walgreens the morning I had to 

purchase Plan B, but I wish I had 

a grown-up I trusted to tell me 

that what I was doing was OK.

Having such a limited scope 

when it comes to sex education 

makes it difficult to really parse 

out the nuances that come up 

when we discuss reproductive 

rights. For instance, the guest 

speaker did insinuate to us that 

Planned Parenthood was lying 

to us, that there was no point in 

going to them for birth control 

or contraceptives because those 

were 
immoral, 
and 
besides, 

they 
provide 
abortions. 
She 

neglected to tell us about the 

litany of services provided other 

than abortion, even aside from 

contraceptives, and how the federal 

funding they receive doesn’t even 

pay for abortions. She told us life 

begins at conception, but there was 

no discussion of how a fetus doesn’t 

even feel pain until 20 to 26 weeks 

into a pregnancy and the complexity 

of ethics surrounding personhood. 

She cheerfully assumed that we 

all had the eventual intention of 

becoming wives and mothers, 

without 
mentioning 
that 

abortions are statistically safer 

than carrying to term, and the 

maternal mortality rate in the 

U.S. is rising. In retrospect, it 

was odd for her to claim moral 

authority on behalf of the church 

when we could talk about how 

women terminating pregnancies 

without 
moral 
condemnation 

was incredibly common for a 

great deal of human history. 

By not providing us with the 

information we need to make 

crucial 
decisions 
about 
our 

bodies — indeed, our health — 

the guest speaker my high school 

hired to handle our sex education 

was essentially telling us she 

didn’t trust us. She didn’t trust 

us with facts, and she didn’t trust 

us to use those facts to make 

informed decisions about our 

bodies.

As further efforts to restrict 

abortion 
are 
made 
by 
the 

government at the federal, state 

and local levels, it becomes clear 

the guest speaker is not the only 

one with the trust issue, but our 

nation as a whole is having trouble 

trusting women. It seems as though 

reproductive rights are constantly 

under attack, and women are 

often shamed and judged under 

the guise of concern. When we 

examine frankly how women’s 

behavior is policed, it reveals the 

true patriarchal (and oftentimes 

racist and classist) nature of 

how we view women and their 

sexual behavior. If the concern 

was about the loss of fertilized 

eggs, then why do we not see 

more pro-life activists talking 

about and investing in attempts 

to prevent miscarriages? This 

is already an under-discussed 

issue, yet about 15-25 percent of 

recognized pregnancies end in 

miscarriage. When data show 

that access to comprehensive sex 

education 
and 
contraceptives 

decreases abortion rates, why 

does 
the 
pro-life 
movement 

insist on abstinence-only sex 

education and limiting access 

to contraceptives? To me, this 

serves to solely to police the 

behavior 
of 
women 
and 
to 

punish them for not adhering 

to arbitrary standards of sexual 

purity.

Why 
is 
society 
unable 

to trust women as rational, 

thoughtful, responsible moral 

agents, 
perfectly 
capable 
of 

weighing the moral decision 

of what to do when and while 

they’re pregnant? Using abortion 

laws and abstinence-only sex 

education to police women and 

their bodies prevents us from 

having open, honest discussions 

about the health and well-being 

of women and their families. 

If we truly want reproductive 

justice, we need to shift the 

conversations 
we’re 
having 

about 
women 
and 
abortion 

from controlling, policing and 

judging to fact-based and honest 

conversations, and we need to 

start with young women.

My 
younger 
sister 
is 
a 

sophomore in high school now 

and she’s probably going to take 

a health class very similar to the 

one I took. The thought of her 

going out into a world where her 

reproductive rights are called 

into question; where she is so 

utterly without a clue that she, 

too, starts crying at Planned 

Parenthood 
because 
no 
one 

ever taught her how to be the 

authority on her own body. We 

need to trust women to be the 

authorities of their own bodies, 

but we need to give them the 

language, the confidence, the 

knowledge and the education 

to do so. Speak to young women 

candidly 
about 
their 
bodies 

and their reproductive choices. 

Maybe then we can prevent at 

least one more girl from having 

a nervous breakdown at Planned 

Parenthood and from having 

Hershey’s Kisses ruined for her 

forever.

As we march towards equality

W

aking 
up 
the 

morning after the 
2016 
presidential 

election 
and 

hearing 
that 

Donald Trump won 
was heartbreaking. 
I had just started 
getting ready for 
school 
when 
my 

mom, 
whom 
I 

have 
never 
seen 

up before I leave 
except 
to 
get 
a 

first day of school 
picture, 
knocked 

on my door. She didn’t even 
have to say anything for me 
to know what happened. I 
walked into the other room 
and hugged my younger sister, 
then I slowly began physically 
and mentally preparing for 
school. I was scared. I had 
been following the election, I 
knew what Trump said about 
people of color, the LGBTQ 
community and women. I 
knew Trump’s lack of respect 
and how harmful it could 
be with his new position of 
authority. I was scared for my 
friends, for my country and 
for myself.

But 
then 
a 
miracle 

happened. 
The 
day 
after 

Trump’s 
inauguration, 

protesters took to the streets 
of 
Washington 
D.C., 
and 

an estimated 4 million all 
across the U.S. joined in. 
Even other countries joined 
in the fight: There were 261 
marches all over the world 
from Antarctica to Zimbabwe. 
It 
was 
likely 
the 
largest 

single-day protest in history. 
People from all walks of life, 
all races, all ethnicities, all 
hometowns and all genders 
came together to protest this 
man who has done nothing 
but belittle and disrespect 
the people he is supposed to 
serve. People from all over the 
world told the new president 
this 
behavior 
would 
not 

stand and that there would 
be pushback against anything 
unpresidential.

And push back we did. 

Every year since Trump was 
elected, the Women’s March 
has 
paraded 
through 
the 

streets, working to make the 
world a better place, even 
with Trump trying to make 
it worse. Jan. 19, 2019 marked 
the third annual Women’s 

March. The Women’s March is 
not just a women’s issue. With 
the 
vast 
intersectionality 

present in such a 
large 
movement, 

it 
has 
taken 
on 

broader challenges 
and issues plaguing 
America. Signs and 
protests from the 
march covered all 
kinds 
of 
issues, 

from LGBTQ and 
disability rights to 
immigration issues. 
While 
admittedly 

lower in attendance than the 
previous two, the fact that it’s 
still happening is a triumph in 
itself.

The march even withstood 

some 
of 
its 
leadership 

crumbling. There has been 
much debate in recent months 
between some of the New 
York leaders of the march 
over what the main goals 

and who the main leaders 
are going to be. There have 
been disagreements on the 
leadership selection. While 
Tamika Mallory, a Black gun 
control activist and Carmen 
Perez, 
a 
criminal 
justice 

reform activist, were selected 
to 
run 
the 
march, 
many 

pitched for having Vanessa 
Wruble, 
a 
white 
Jewish 

woman, front the movement. 
Mallory and Perez believe 
that women of color should be 
fronting the Women’s March 
because they have long been in 
the shadow of white feminists, 
while Wruble wants to work 
alongside them because they 
all fight for the same cause. 
These 
disagreements 
led 

to Wruble splitting off and 
creating her own movement 
and march called “March 
On.” Many were also angered 
and considered not marching 
when it came out that Mallory 
praised 
Louis 
Farrakhan, 

a 
well-known 
anti-Semitic 

leader of the Nation of Islam. 
The 
organization 
issued 

statements denouncing anti-
Semitism, but Mallory has 
not revoked her support of 
Farrakhan. 
However, 
most 

decided 
the 
movement 
is 

bigger than Mallory, Wruble 
or any discord among their 
leaders and came to show 
their support for a cause they 
believe in either way, leading 
to a small but successful 
statement.

Some protests are still 

scheduled to happen. Ann 
Arbor has its own “Women 
March On for Justice” on 
March 16 from 2 to 4 p.m. in the 
Diag. Plenty of protests have 
taken place at the University 
of Michigan, many of which 
involved 
women’s 
rights. 

Like many others all over 
the world, Ann Arbor held its 
own Women’s March on Jan. 
21, 2017, in solidarity with 
the march in Washington, 
D.C. While the protest in Ann 
Arbor this year will not be on 
the same day, it will have the 
same message: We will stand 
together to make this world a 
better place.

Despite the demoralization 

in 
having 
a 
despicable 

president, the past few years 
have 
led 
to 
astronomical 

gains for women. Hundreds 
of women have run for office, 
stood 
up 
against 
sexual 

assault, registered to vote 
and fought injustice. Right 
now we have more women in 
Congress than ever before — 
many of whom are women of 
color. The Women’s March is 
a physical manifestation of 
the changing times. Women 
are gaining ground politically 
and socially, and however 
difficult the road to equality 
may be, it will pay off in 
the end. Though with split 
leadership, 
the 
cause 
has 

been more difficult to define, 
we all want the same thing 
in the end: equality for all. I 
hope when the next election’s 
results are announced, I will 
be proud of who our country 
has chosen, and I think the 
courage women have shown 
through these marches will 
get us there.

And in this current 
time, I wish I had 
received a little 
more guidance


The protagonist in Maurice 
Carlos Ruffin’s novel “We Cast A 
Shadow” does not have a name. 
The absence of his name is hardly 
noticeable throughout the story, 
except for the first line in which 
he narrates, “My name doesn’t 
matter. All you need to know is that 
I’m a phantom, a figment, a man 
who was mistaken for waitstaff 
twice that night.” In many ways, 
his name really doesn’t matter. 
It is his experiences as a Black 
American and a father with a white 
wife and biracial child, that help 
readers connect to him more than 
his name ever could. Without his 
name, the only thing readers have 
to judge him by are his thoughts 
and actions. Ruffin’s deliberate 
choice to leave his protagonist 
nameless places a focus on who he 
is and what he believes, giving the 
story a decidedly personal feel.
“We Cast A Shadow” is Ruffin’s 
debut novel, a project he has 
been working on since 2014. 
An earlier version of the novel 
under the working title of “All of 
the Lights” won a gold medal in 
the 
William 
Faulkner-William 
Wisdom writing competition. His 
short story “The Ones Who Don’t 
Say They Love You” received 
the 2014 Iowa Review award for 
fiction. He earned an MFA from 
the University of New Orleans 
Creative Writing Workshop and is 
also a member of the Peauxdunque 
Writers Alliance.
The novel, which is heavily 

influenced 
by 
Ralph 
Ellison’s 
“Invisible Man,” revolves around 
the man, his wife and their son, 
Nigel, in an America where a 
procedure has been developed 
that gives “doctors” the power 
to make people white. Although 
the man and his family seem 
happy and content at first, it is 
soon revealed that the narrator is 
tormented with the knowledge of 
something he believes will bring 
endless pain and suffering to his 

son’s life: Nigel is becoming Black.
It all started when Nigel was 
born and his father noticed a small 
black patch at the top of his eye. 
The narrator’s life soon becomes a 
scramble to keep Nigel out of the 
sun and away from anything that 
could cause his skin to continue 
darkening. 
He 
soon 
realizes, 
however, that there is nothing 
he can do to stop the patch from 
spreading, so he turns to what 
he believes is the only answer he 

has left: finding enough money to 
send his son in for the whitening 
procedure.
Ruffin has crafted a heavy, 
thought-provoking 
novel 
that 
leads readers to grapple with 
questions of race and social 
responsibility that are highly 
relevant to the current political 
climate. While the story deals 
with a range of issues, from 
corrupt law firms and politicians 
to the activist/terrorist group 
ADZE, it truly shines in the 
focus it places on the familial 
relationships within it. The 
narrator’s relationship with 
his wife is strained yet loving, 
a realistic example of two 
people struggling to care for 
their son and give him the 
best life they possibly can. His 
relationship with Nigel is even 
more complex and touching. 
He claims he is determined 
and willing to do whatever 
he can to keep his son safe, 
but fails to realize the cost his 
actions will have on his son’s 
life, and eventually, his entire 
family.
The entire novel is narrated 
from the father’s point of view, and 
it is revealed in the later chapters 
that it is in fact an account of his 
time as a parent written for his 
son to read. It makes for a gripping 
and heart-wrenching story and 
a valuable addition to the fiction 
canon. But mostly, it serves as 
a reminder that at the heart of 
politics and turmoil there is 
family, and that is what motivates 
us and gives us hope.

BOOK REVIEW
‘We Cast a Shadow’ reminds 
us of family in divisive times

SOPHIE WASLOWSKI
Daily Arts Writer

Educator, 
author 
and 
activist 
Mabel 
O. 
Wilson 
visited the Taubman College 
of Architecture and Urban 
Planning this past Friday 
to give a lecture entitled 
“Memory/Race/Nation: 
The 
Politics 
of 
Modern 
Memorials” as the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Martin 
Luther King Jr. Symposium 
guest 
lecturer 
this 
year. 
Wilson 
currently 
teaches 
architectural 
history 
and 
theory at Columbia University 
and performs research as a 
Senior Fellow at the Institute 
for 
Research 
in 
African 
American Studies.
“The limits of traditional 
(architectural) 
practice 
couldn’t answer all of the 
questions I had,” said Wilson 
on 
her 
involvement 
in 
research and scholarly work 
on top of her design work.
Recently, Wilson became 
fascinated 
by 
Alexander 
Weheliye’s “Habeas Viscus,” 
a book on the centrality of 
race in what it means to be 
human. 
Wilson’s 
biggest 
takeaway from the book was 
Weheliye’s concept of “racial 
assemblages”: the historical 
outcome of the impact of race 
on our social order.
“What we take for public 
never has been. There have 
always been exclusions,” said 
Wilson.
Architecture has always 
been entangled with racial 
assemblages, from the design 
of slave ships to maximize the 
quantity of slaves that could 
make it to the New World to 
the design of contemporary 
public housing. This has never 
been more evident than today 
in Charlottesville, Virginia, 
home of the University of 
Virginia 
(where 
Wilson 
attended for undergrad) and 
the “Unite the Right” Rally 
of August 2017, also known as 
the Charlottesville riots.
The University of Virginia 
(UVA) 
was 
founded 
by 
Thomas Jefferson in 1819. 
In archived letters written 
by Jefferson at the time 

to friends and colleagues, 
Jefferson made it clear that he 
wanted strictly neoclassical 
architecture for the university 
to emulate the high times of 
democratic Rome and Greece. 
What wasn’t spelled out quite 
so clearly in those letters was 
that, along with these ideas 
of an architecture of justice, 
liberty and equality was a 
history of slave building and 
the subsequent rejection of 
non-whites from those spaces.
The 
entirety 
of 
UVA’s 
campus built prior to the 
abolishment of slavery was 
made by slaves. The same 
can be said for Virginia’s 
state capitol, also designed 
by Jefferson based on the 
Maison Carrée in Nîmes, 
France. In the central hall of 
the capitol, Jefferson wanted 
to dedicate a statue of George 
Washington so as to, among 
other reasons, instill the space 

with a sense of “American 
virtue.” Such virtue at the 
time, unfortunately, did not 
include being Black.
While many dismiss slave 
owners’ support of or at least 
tacit acceptance of slavery 
as the result of the feelings 
of 
their 
time, 
Jefferson 
had some very particular 
problems with Black people. 
Truthfully, he was viscerally 
and visually appalled by them. 
He believed skin color was 
of divine causation, and that 
those bestowed with Black 
skin were inherently “dull, 
tasteless, and anomalous.”
So it’s no wonder that, 
in response to the “Unite 
the Right” rally of August, 
Black Lives Matter covered 
Jefferson’s statue at the center 
of 
campus 
with 
garbage 

bags and signs reading “TJ 
is a racist rapist” and “Black 
Lives Matter, Fuck White 
Supremacists.” The students 
wanted UVA to remove its 
historical 
connection 
to 
racism as many schools across 
the country had been doing 
since the 2000s. Since the 
protests, no news has surfaced 
as to the statue’s removal, 
although the Charlottesville 
city council did vote 3-2 in 
favor of the removal of a statue 
of confederate general Robert 
E. Lee at the city’s center back 
in 2017 (although for various 
reasons it remains up today).
However, 
Wilson’s 
talk 
was less about the logistics of 
removing existing memorials 
and more about humanizing 
the slaves of Charlottesville’s 
past by giving them their 
very own memorial. While 
about 4,000 slaves worked 
for UVA in its early history, 
only several hundred of their 
names are known due to mere 
lack of acknowledgment in 
the 
university’s 
historical 
record. At the end of her talk, 
Wilson unveiled renderings 
she had been working on 
of a planned Memorial to 
Enslaved Laborers just east of 
the campus’s central rotunda.
The memorial is designed as 
a ring of Virginia mist granite 
that slants down to envelope 
a grassy area surrounded by 
a mote. Along the inner wall 
of the granite, 4,000 blank 
spaces are allotted for names 
but only several hundred are 
filled. Engraved in the stone 
at the bottom of the mote are 
significant historical events 
of the era of slavery, many of 
which were brutally violent.
Despite this confrontation 
of the cold, hard truth, the 
monument offers hope above 
all else. The water that gently 
wafts 
through 
the 
mote 
symbolizes the passage of 
time and the escape from the 
horrific events of the past. 
The grassy area at the center 
is a peaceful place of union 
where students and faculty 
may come together and relax, 
thankful that we’re better 
than we once were while 
acknowledging that we’re not 
perfect yet.

Wilson talks links of 
racism, architecture

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

JUSTIN BECK

The second night of the 42nd Ann 
Arbor Folk Festival at The Ark, a local 
music club dedicated to good music 
and good times, was nothing short of 
magical.
Maybe the magic came from the 
Narnian 
winter 
wonderland 
the 
audience found themselves in after 
leaving the warm embrace of the 
University’s Hill Auditorium post-
concert, just before the clock struck 
midnight. Maybe it was The RFD Boys 
playing fiddle and singing some old-
time blues as if they were in a back-
alley rafting bar deep in southern West 
Virginia. Maybe it was AHI, standing 
there in a black rider’s cap he bought off 
the internet, soulfully singing of finding 
himself. Maybe it was Pokey LaFarge, 
standing solo stage, looking like Hank 
Williams fresh-off a concert at the 
Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tenn. 
Maybe it was everything combined–– 
and that was only the first half of the 
show, too.
But the magic in the room wasn’t 
only restrained to the stage, either.
On the left, an elderly couple danced 
lovingly to songs of fallen angels. To 
the right, a gentleman shot to his feet 
in standing ovation after every song. 
Somewhere in the middle, two young 
writers blinked away rebellious tears in 
the safety of the dark.
The RFD Boys opened up the night, 
treating Ann Arbor to some classic 
folk tunes. 50 years strong and still 
going, The RFD Boys are regulars at 
The Ark. Despite their long career (and 
advancing age), the group showed no 
signs of slowing down — the RFD boys, 

if anything, have merely aged like some 
good whiskey (or moonshine). The 
entire performance was electrifying 
and delivered some much-needed, foot-
stomping fiddle on a cold winter’s night.
Then, 
with 
his 
soul-bearing 
honesty, AHI was larger-than-life on 
stage, throwing his entire being into 
every moment. But what made the 
performance so captivating wasn’t just 
the lead singer himself, but rather the 
band’s group dynamic. One could see 
the inherent connection — musical 
and personal — between each musician 
on stage. It was this perfect cohesion 
between each band member that made 
the performance incredibly intimate 
and forged a sense of community 
between 
everyone 
in 
the 
room, 
musician and audience member alike.
To round out the first half of the 
festival, Pokey LaFarge walked on 
stage looking like he had just hopped 
out of the 1950s. LaFarge seemingly 
embodied a legacy of country and 
folk legends. Yet, his performance felt 
fresh, rather than overdone. More than 
his music, however, it was LaFarge’s 
vulnerability standing solo on stage and 
his immediate camaraderie with the 
audience that made his set stand out. 
LaFarge’s performance was a perfect 
example of why the magic of live 
music is so tantalizing. To see LaFarge 
perform last night was the equivalent 
of walking into the famous Grand Ole 
Opry and watching Patsy Cline or Hank 
Williams back in an age gone by.

Arts Writer

“If you can’t afford 
therapy, you might as 
well listen to folk.” 
This is something I 
couldn’t get out of my 
head all of Saturday 
night, as I sat in the red 
velvet chairs of Hill 
Auditorium 
for 
the 
second night of this 
year’s Ann Arbor Folk 
Festival. It’s funny, but 
true — nothing can get 
you crying in public 
quite 
like 
hearing 
people bear their souls 
50 feet away from you, singing their 
stories like it’s the last thing they’ll 
ever say.
The Festival is arguably one of the 
biggest music events in the metro-
Detroit area each year, a collection 
of folk and blues’s best and brightest 
for two nights in the cold January 
wind. 2019’s lineup was particularly 
striking, featuring huge acts like 
Brandi Carlile and Rufus Wainwright 
as headliners on Friday and Saturday. 
Alongside them was a series of equally 
incredible musicians that made each 
night one for the ages. Although I can 
only speak for Saturday, I can honestly 
say the show was life-changing, and 
that’s not hyperbole. It is every year, 
and probably will be forever, if folk 
continues its 100-year roll through 
America.
The two secondary headliners for 
Jan. 26 were Joan Osborne and I’m 
With Her, a trio made up of folk stars 
Aoife O’Donovan, Sarah Jarosz and 

Sara Watkins. Osborne brought the Folk 
Festival’s audiences an inventive set of 
Bob Dylan classics along with guitarist 
and fellow vocalist Jackie Greene. 
Called “Dylanology,” Osborne and 
friends brought the house down with 
their renditions of hits like “Knockin’ 
On Heaven’s Door” and “Don’t Think 
Twice, It’s All Right,” bringing new 
life to the timeless words. Afterward, 
I’m With Her took the stage, and also 
took the audience’s breath away — 
O’Donovan, Jarosz and Watkins are 
masters of their craft, weaving their 
voices together to absolutely stunning 
ends. They played an hour-long set, but 
it felt like minutes due to their music’s 
sheer, undeniable beauty. I can only 
explain it by asking anyone to drive out 
and hear them live if possible, because 
their music is nearly perfection.
And, of course, at the end of the night, 
came 
Wainwright. 
The 
composer, 
singer, songwriter extraordinaire is 
one of those people that don’t seem 

human because of their talent, yet, 
Wainwright’s biggest strength is the 
fact that he is so human. His lyrics 
read like ironic, funny, sharp poems on 
paper, but when Wainwright sings, all 
the listener can do is sit slack-jawed. 
Venues like Hill Auditorium were built 
for musicians like Wainwright — there 
were moments during his set that the 
venue literally began to vibrate with 
the intensity of his voice and piano. 
It was only when he brought out the 
rest of the night’s musicians for a 
group rendition of “Hallelujah” that I 
realized tears were streaming down my 
face. Through broken guitar strings, 
massage-parlor stories and a million 
little jokes, Wainwright closed the 
festival with the ease and familiarity 
that only true performers have, and 
a voice that can only be described as 
God-given.

Maggie Rogers thrives in a space 
where elements oppose each other. Pair 
that with an ability to not only feel the 
world vehemently, but to recalibrate 
when life rapidly transfigures, and you 
get Heard it in a Past Life.
Life 
changed 
dramatically 
for 
Rogers in July of 2016, when Pharrell 
Williams held a surprise master class 
at NYU, where Rogers was completing 
her senior year as a music student. 
Although Williams listened to multiple 
examples of student work, he quickly 
lionized Rogers within the classroom 
setting, heaping praise on her song 
“Alaska.” Williams noticed a match 
between Rogers’s description of her 
lived experience and the music. She 
described her sound as rooted in the 
folk from her youth (having grown up 
playing harp and banjo), but also as 
taking on a new life when she studied 
abroad and discovered the world of 
electronic dance music. Unknowingly 
to Rogers, Pharrell’s praises were 
recorded on video and uploaded to 
YouTube. Two million views later, and 
Rogers has achieved eminence in the 
music industry.
Following the viral video, Rogers 
launched a world tour, starred as a 
musical guest on “SNL” and opened 

for Mumford and Sons, all after 
only releasing a five-song EP and a 
couple of singles. In her documentary 
published in March of 2018, she relayed 
the daunting notion of life spinning 
out of control, and the importance 
of creating a thoughtful, reflective 
space to artistically create on her own 
time. Heard it In a Past Life is Rogers’s 
proclamation of recapturing herself 

and her story.
The album explores contradictions, 
particularly those that have emerged 
since Rogers’s rise to fame. Rogers 
creates a space that explores humanity 
with a lens that is both macroscopic 
and microscopic, a freedom that is 
exhilarating yet messy and a sense of 
self that is rapidly changing while also 
continuous. These opposing ideas fit 
perfectly into the contradiction that 
is Rogers: folk with slight southern 
twang, paired smoothly with electronic 
production.

The 
album 
intimately 
inspects 
a human’s ability to be a tiny speck 
among 
the 
immensity 
of 
Earth. 
However, humans are simultaneously 
large-scale, inherently introspective, 
ever-changing while holding the ability 
to influence the world grandly. The 
track “Alaska” touches on the austere 
grandeur of Earth, as Rogers’s trip 
to Alaska after her freshman year of 
college illuminated the colossal size 
of the state’s mountain scenery. Such 
landscape makes one feel so small, like 
a gear in the bigger machine. Heard it 
In a Past Life weaves this macro feeling 
that the scenery of Alaska provides 
through each track. For example, the 
song “Overnight” uses samples from 
glacier and frog sounds. Moreover, 
when reflecting on the song “Alaska,” 
Rogers posted the following comment 
on Instagram about the process of 
naming the album: “There are so many 
aspects of this song that feel like they 
don’t belong to me, like it’s so much 
bigger than me. Like I heard it in a past 
life…”
But the album doesn’t just explore 
the human life as one piece among a 
much bigger puzzle. It also runs micro, 
touching on introspectively watching 
oneself change.

‘Heard it in a Past Life’ rings 
in a space between opposites

ALBUM REVIEW

It is the second semester 
of my junior year in college 
and 
everyone 
has 
left 
Ann Arbor. Maybe they 
were smart to leave, as 
temperatures 
become 
negative and the possibility 
that 
the 
administration 
might actually cancel classes 
for the first time in five years 
looms. Whatever the reason, 
the second semester of junior 
year is a time where a lot of us 
choose to study abroad. For 
foodies, this means endless 
gastronomically 
diverse 
culinary experiences around 
the globe — spicy, fresh 
paella served in a sizzling 
carbon steel pan in Spain, 
all the textbook cacio e pepe 
in Rome, round crackling 
Napoli pizzas with fresh 
basil leaves and gobs of warm 
mozzarella 
swimming 
in 
the perfect smear of grassy 
tomato sauce, paper thin 
crepes exploding with swirls 
of nutella and sliced banana 
on the streets of Paris, glasses 
of chilled French white wine 
and dark moody Italian reds, 
cappuccinos and espressos 
and nutty biscottis.
The knowledge of the 
culinary world outstretched 
before me for thousands 
of miles in every direction 
has put me in a food lover’s 
rut. I am sick with envy 
knowing 
what 
culinary 
experiences 
lie 
waiting 
overseas, experiences that 
my classmates and friends 
who traveled this semester 

are currently discovering. 
The Instagram photos of 
their sensational meals in 
Europe, South America, Asia 
and Israel just don’t satisfy 
the craving I have to travel 
in pursuit of discoveries 
through the diverse culture 
of food.
In all my envy — filling 
notebook pages with wishes 
and woes of meals in the 
Italian 
countryside 
and 
cafes with views of the Eiffel 
Tower, staring at Snapchat 
stories and photographs of 
every towering hazelnut ice 
cream in Prague and pool 
of hummus accented with a 
swirl of olive oil, imagining 
myself sipping the perfect 
midday aperol spritz over a 
copy of an old Faulkner I’ve 
read twice already — I lost 
what the city that I call home 
means to me.
Ann Arbor, despite being 
a classic university town, 
houses 
more 
than 
your 
typical college food spots. It 
has a grown-up, culturally 
diverse, spirited food scene — 
one that has been curated by a 
forward thinking community 
of intellects who constantly 
push the boundaries of the 
expected in all realms of life. 
The culinary spirit of our city 
spans miles and countries, 
time and space, all within 
walking distance and for far 
less than the cost of a plane 
ticket to leave Michigan.
Though 
I’m 
one 
to 
argue the Midwest doesn’t 
know a thing about pizza, 
there are certainly some 
Italian restaurants pushing 

themselves 
toward 
the 
wood 
fire, 
doughy-yet-
crispy heart of an authentic 
Italian pizza, something I 
could devour in moments 
while burning the roof of my 
mouth on stringy cheese and 
tangy sauce. Bigalora Wood 
Fired Cucina is definitely 
challenging themselves to 
incorporate more authentic 
Italian flavors in their trendy 
upscale pizza joint, which 
features tons of hip finger 
foods and a too-good-to-be-
true gluten free crust. When 
I am pining after the pizza of 
my childhood, or the pizza of 
any cafe in Naples, I am quick 
to order Bigalora — a place I 
know I can trust to deliver 
flavors that put me on a plane 
to Italy within a matter of 
moments.
Ann Arbor has created a 
diverse flavor personality, 
not pigeonholing itself to be 
one specific flavor or cuisine. 
It ignores the conventional 
wisdom behind Midwestern 
cities and food, pushing 
itself to find an idiosyncratic 
culinary persona. Ann Arbor 
is breakfast food. It is really 
good burgers and the perfect 
menu that combines some of 
the sunny West Coast with 
a New York state of mind. 
Fleetwood Diner and Blimpy 
Burger 
are 
Ann 
Arbor 
classics that are perfectly 
suited for a city with such 
quirks and non-conventional 
taste. 

A world of flavor

“IO” is the latest film in 
a series of Netflix misfires. 
The 
low-budget, 
sci-fi
 
drama directed by Jonathan 
Helpert (“House of Time”) 
involves only a duo of 
characters 
and 
limited 
sets to convey profound 
(but 
actually 
unoriginal) 
observations 
about 
humanity, 
and 
crumples 
quickly 
under 
atrocious 
writing and an exhausting 
narrative structure.
The story takes place 
years after a catastrophic 
environmental 
collapse 
on Earth made the planet 
uninhabitable, forcing most 
of the population to relocate 
to a space station on Io, a 
moon of Jupiter. Sam, a 
biologist played by Margaret 
Qualley (“The Nice Guys”), 
searches 
for 
possibilities 
of 
continuing 
human 
life back on Earth, while 
Micah (Anthony Mackie, 
“Avengers: Infinity War”), 
another straggler on the 
planet, implores her to board 
the last shuttle to Io.
Unfortunately, the most 
notable aspect of the movie is 
just how boring the concept 
is. Sam’s research project is 
laden with melodramatic, 
blunt voiceover that sounds 
neither scientific nor moving. 
Her character is so passively 
written that it’s a wonder 
Qualley is able to breath any 

life into the character at all. 
The actress does her best to 
read these lines of voiceover 
and dialogue with nuance, 
but they are still rarely more 
than robotic.
These missteps make up 
the entire first half of the 
film, after which point a 
viewer may find it difficult 
to 
stay 
conscious. 
The 
introduction 
of 
Mackie’s 
character, despite providing 
the 
film 
with 
some 
momentum, 
only 
makes 
the 
conversations 
more 
ridiculous. The two start 
quoting Plato and Homer 

to each other verbatim and 
analyze the human condition 
in laughably heavy-handed 
ways. Without a modicum 
of 
chemistry, 
they 
are 
inexplicably drawn toward 
each other simply to advance 
the story. They both lose 
their agency to the whim of 
the screenwriters, flipping 
on decisions and convictions 
that 
were 
apparently 
central to their actions. It’s 
simultaneously 
perplexing 
and miserable to behold.
After 
what 
feels 
like 
decades 
of 
this 
empty 
philosophical jargon echoing 
around, it becomes clear that 
the filmmakers have no idea 
how to end the trainwreck in 

a climactic way. What ensues 
is, shockingly, a conflict that 
emerges from thin air and 
resolves itself with more 
conjured melodrama. It’s 
akin to 2016’s “Passengers,” 
another contained sci-fi film 
with a halfway-intriguing 
premise 
and 
a 
bungled 
finale.
In the end, “IO” plays out 
as if it were conceived as a 
TV show, with disconnected 
plot 
points 
that 
resolve 
whenever 
convenient 
for 
the writer. The conflicts 
are so disjointedly episodic 
that the film is unsure of 
its own identity, leaping 
from survivalist drama to 
romance to science fiction. 
Even the 96 minute runtime 
drags beyond belief.
There is truthfully little 
reason to put oneself through 
this mess at all. Most casual 
moviegoers 
have 
likely 
already seen the tropes “IO” 
has to offer, whether in the 
abandonment of Earth as a 
viable home in “Interstellar” 
or the esoteric fascination 
of a lone scientist in an 
unfamiliar environment in 
“The Martian.” In fact, it 
might just be easier to believe 
“IO” is the work of aliens 
whose only knowledge of 
humans is sci-fi films from 
the 21st century rather than 
a product of actual humans. 
And with that ludicrous 
theory 
in 
mind, 
maybe 
there’s one legitimate reason 
to watch “IO.”

‘IO’ should remain in 
Jupiter’s moon system

Heard it in 
a Past Life

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Tuesday, January 29, 2019 — 7

W

ith less than two 
minutes left in 
the game, fresh-
man forward 
Naz Hillmon 
notched a 
crucial layup 
to give the 
Michigan 
women’s bas-
ketball team 
hope.
The 
bucket cut 
the Wolver-
ines’ deficit 
against No. 23 Michigan State 
to just four points. That defi-
cit had reached as high as 15 
in the third quarter, and thus 
Michigan’s comeback seemed 
destined for 
completion.
The Wolver-
ines, though, 
couldn’t fin-
ish the job and 
missed out on 
what would 
have been a 
huge win — for 
a variety of rea-
sons.
For starters, 
it was a rivalry game — and 
that rivalry has been lopsided. 
Entering Sunday’s contest, the 
Spartans led the all-time battle 
68-19 and were 9-4 since Mich-
igan hired coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. Thus, winning the close 
game would have given the 
Wolverines some much-needed 
momentum for the rivalry.
Instead, Barnes Arico and 
Michigan have now lost five of 
the last six meetings.
Additionally, Big Ten play 
has troubled the Wolverines so 
far, so a win on Sunday would 
have been helpful. But now, 
Michigan stands 10th in the 
conference with a 3-6 record 
and is no longer undefeated at 
home. The team has yet to pick 
up a conference victory on the 
road and has now lost four out 
of its last five games.
Midway through the open-

ing quarter, senior guard 
Nicole Munger collided with 
defenders while driving 
hard to the basket. She went 
down immediately, had to be 
helped off the court and never 
returned.
“I mean, right when it hap-
pened we knew it was gonna be 
something that would take her 
out of the game completely,” 
said sophomore forward Hai-
ley Brown. “Munger is a very 
tough player, so when she goes 
down she’s not gonna come 
back in the game. But, when we 
were huddling we were saying, 
you know, ‘We gotta bounce 
back from this, like regroup 
and do this for Munger.’ She’s 
one of our hustlers.”
Munger’s 
departure shook 
the Wolver-
ines, as they 
soon gave up a 
13-2 run. They 
did regroup 
and fight back 
with sparks of 
promising play, 
but ultimately 
missed out on 
what would 
have been a momentous victory 

and a huge statement on behalf 
of their fallen teammate.
A win would have been huge 
for Brown, too. In the last 
rivalry meeting, in East Lan-
sing, she experienced a season-
ending lower left leg injury and 
her team lost the game.
This time around, she got 
off to a hot start by grabbing 
multiple rebounds and sink-
ing shots early on. She looked 
set to make an extra impact to 
compensate for what happened 
last season. But with the loss, 
she too missed out.
“It’s a rivalry game and we 
had them at home, so it’s a lit-
tle bit different, but of course 
I was fired up to play,” Brown 
said. “I feel like I missed out 
a little bit last 
season with 
that. But it was 
a great atmo-
sphere to play, 
it’s just we fell 
short on the out-
come.”
When asked 
about positive 
takeaways, 
Brown was for-
ward-looking.
“We play them again,” 

Brown said. “So, I mean, that’s 
the only positive we have. 
We’ll go back and regroup as 
a team, get some couple wins 
on our belt and then we’ll play 
them again on their home 
court.”
Prior to the game, ESPN’s 
Charlie Creme projected 
Michigan as a bubble team for 
the NCAA Tournament. A win 
against a ranked Michigan 
State team would have sharp-
ened the Wolverines’ resume 
— giving them a quality victory 
in a season that’s more than 
halfway through.
Now, Michigan’s tourna-
ment hopes have suffered yet 
another deafening blow. Now, 
the Wolverines must think 
about adjust-
ing if Munger’s 
injury is seri-
ous.
And now, 
they’ll think 
about what 
could have been 
if they’d won 
this game.

Michigan starts year 
by beating Minnesota

Cameron Bock took a deep 
breath as he dangled from the 
parallel bars.
The sophomore rolled his 
feet forward and remained 
calm as he swung his body 
above 
the 
wooden 
beams. 
His teammates on the No. 3 
Michigan men’s gymnastics 
team 
went 
wild 
as 
he 
dismounted, flipping through 
the air with his legs held at a 
seamless 90-degree angle in 
front of his body. The board 
flashed 14.700, earning Bock 
the 
second-highest 
parallel 
bar score in the country this 
season.
Bock’s performance aided 
the Wolverines Saturday in 
their 413.150-408.300 defeat of 
powerhouse No. 7 Minnesota.
When asked if the unfamiliar 
matchup — Michigan’s first 
competition 
against 
the 
Golden 
Gophers in 12 
years — added 
any 
stress, 
Michigan coach 
Kurt 
Golder 
said 
that 
he 
thought 
it 
was 
more 
so 
an 
exciting 
experience for 
the athletes.
“None of the guys have 
ever been there,” Golder said. 
“They are used to Ohio State 
and Illinois. I think it was 
something they were looking 
forward to.”
The Wolverines’ triumph 
landed them the title of being 
the 
second 
highest-scoring 
team in the Big Ten.
Michigan 
was 
especially 
forceful on the vault in the final 
rotation of the afternoon, with 
sophomore Emyre Cole rating 
14.850 alongside sophomore 

Anthony McCallum’s 14.750.
“It was great sticking my 
floor dismount,” Cole said. 
“I didn’t have a lot of events 
today, so I could really focus 
on the three (events), which 
helped my mental state.”
Cole shined all afternoon, 
scoring 13.250 on the pommel 
horse and 14.300 on the floor. 
After gliding into a mid-air 
body rotation, his body went to 
the floor. Cole’s handstand fell 
forward as he rolled upwards 
to finish the floor routine with 
an elegant flip. He left the mat 
and was greeted by excited 
teammates 
that 
cheered 
throughout his routine.
“It feels like the team is your 
anchor in that moment,” Cole 
said. “Them being that anchor 
is really amazing because you 
just want to run back there and 
get all that validation.”
Despite ripping his grip 
before his routine on the 
still rings, sophomore Matt 
Whitaker 
defied 
gravity 
with an in-air 
middle 
split 
that progressed 
into a balanced 
handstand. He 
dismounted 
with a flip and a 
perfect landing.
“I had to go 
behind the last 
guy and redo 
my set because of the grip 
problem,” Whittaker said. “To 
handle the adversity and come 
out strong was great.”
This is the first year where 
performance in dual meets 
determines who competes in 
the championship. The meet 
against Minnesota was one 
with enormous implications, 
as the Wolverines opened up 
with a big win.
“The next meet should be 
easy compared to this,” Golder 
said. “Because it is at home 
against Ohio State.”

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico’s team squandered a key opportunity to bolster its resume against Michigan State.

We play them 
again. That’s the

Freshmen provide glimpse of future

When Andrew Fenty and 
Patrick Maloney inked their 
letters of intent to play tennis 
for 
Michigan 
coach 
Adam 
Steinberg, the two freshmen 
had all the boxes checked. That 
is, except for one.
Fenty — who enters the season 
as the No. 4 youth player in the 
nation — has put his skills to the 
test both at home and abroad, 
competing in the U.S. Open, 
Roland Garros, Wimbledon and 
Australian Open junior draws 
last year. Maloney, meanwhile, 
took home last year’s New 
York State singles title, earning 
All-American honors in the 
process. With a combined 19-5 
record against other five-star 
recruits in the 2018 cycle, the 
duo 
headlines 
the 
NCAA’s 
fifth-ranked class. At an initial 
glance, it’s tough to find a flaw 
in the talented tandem’s paths 
to Ann Arbor.
The missing element? Team-
style tennis.
“It’s no longer 
about 
me, 
it’s 
about the team,” 
Fenty 
said. 
“I 
have to push the 
guy next to me. 
And that’s what 
(Maloney and I) 
do — that’s why 
we’re 
different 
than 
other 
(freshmen).”
After a long fall of individual 
competition, the 24th-ranked 
Wolverines entered the team 
season with their sights sets 
on Saturday’s ITA Kick-Off. 
Thanks to last year’s Sweet 
Sixteen 
run 
— 
Michigan’s 
first since 2008 — the team 
earned the right to host the 
tournament for the first time 
in program history, drawing 
national attention to Fenty and 
Maloney’s home debut.
The two new kids on the 
block didn’t disappoint.
Fenty and Maloney showed 
flashes of maturity beyond their 
years Saturday, adding to their 
cumulative 4-1 record in the 
process. Given the program’s 

heavy 
emphasis 
on 
energy 
and 
leadership, 
Fenty 
and 
Maloney’s dominant team start 
is more than just impressive — 
it’s a sign that they can become 
program cornerstones.
After falling short in a pair of 
doubles tiebreakers against No. 
22 Alabama last weekend, Fenty 
and Maloney spearheaded the 
team’s significant improvement 
in its 4-1 win over North 
Carolina 
State. 
Fenty 
and 
sophomore 
Mattias Siimar 
cruised 
to 
a 
6-1 
victory, 
while Maloney 
and 
senior 
Myles 
Schalet 
captured a 6-2 
win to grab the 
morning’s first 
point 
at 
the 
Varsity Tennis 
Center, 
where 
the Wolverines boast a 37-3 
record since 2016.
Fenty and Maloney’s singles 
prowess, coupled with their 
willingness to adapt, have made 
it easy for Steinberg to welcome 
them into the doubles fold 
immediately.
On the singles court, the 
tandem’s debut nearly ignited 
a 
comeback 
in 
Tuscaloosa 
when Fenty shocked Patrick 
Kaukovalta — the country’s 
No. 41 player — 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, 
while Maloney held on against 
Alexey Nesterov for a gripping 
7-6, 6-4 win. Despite building 
upon those performances by 
securing their respective first 
sets 
against 
the 
Wolfpack 

on Saturday, neither of their 
would-be 
singles 
victories 
counted once Michigan earned 
the clinching point.
With two strong outings 
now in the books, Steinberg is 
starting to see the resemblance 
between his newcomers and 
last year’s graduating class.
“(Fenty and Maloney) are 
unbelievable,” Steinberg said. 
“They’ve become a lot more 
aggressive at this level. They’re 
such great competitors and 
they’re loving every minute of 
it. Besides being good players, 
they’re experienced and they 
know pressure. The two of them 
have been a spark for our team 
for sure. It’s always tough when 
you lose four seniors and bring 
in new guys hoping they’ll fit in 
well, but they’re doing great.”
From 
the 
rookies’ 
perspective, they’re not here to 
devote their freshmen seasons 
to learning the ropes — rather, 
they’ve put in the work to help 
propel this year’s group to its 
full potential.
“We have to grow up fast,” 
Fenty said. “I don’t think of 
myself as ‘the freshman’ on 
the team, I think of myself as 
a leader, and I know (Maloney) 
does too. We try to push the 
guys and do our job.”
If 
Fenty 
and 
Maloney 
continue to do their jobs at 
this level, last year’s Sweet 
Sixteen appearance won’t be a 
fluke. And, after watching his 
youngsters prosper in their first 
two team matches, it’s safe to 
say Steinberg can check off that 
final box.

With “a little bit of cannibalism 
going on,” ‘M’ stays above the fray

The Big Ten is eating itself 
alive.
That’s clear to anyone who’s 
watching. Including Michigan 
coach John Beilein.
“There’s 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
cannibalism going on right now 
between the teams — it just 
happened Saturday with some 
of these away teams winning,” 
Beilein said on a conference call 
with reporters Monday. “That 
was something we wanted to stay 
from when we were at home, for 
sure.”
Those road wins on Saturday 
— Ohio State beating Nebraska 
and Rutgers beating Penn State — 
were far from the least-surprising 
results in the conference over the 
weekend. That same day, Illinois 
took down No. 13 Maryland, and 
the next day, No. 9 Michigan 
State went to Purdue and fell by 
10 points.
One of few teams to stay 
removed from the chaos resides 
in Ann Arbor, as Michigan has 
started Big Ten play with an 
8-1 record. And the Wolverines 
would like it to stay that way.
“I definitely would have taken 
that (at the beginning of the 
season),” Beilein said.
The other coaches in the 
conference can’t boast quite as 
sunny dispositions.

“Our team in general right now 
is soft,” Indiana’s Archie Miller 
said Friday night after Michigan 
went into Assembly Hall and 
blew out the Hoosiers, 69-46. 
“And we’re also for whatever 
reason right now scared, and you 
can just tell by the way that we 
played.
“The fight isn’t there right 
now, and the confidence isn’t 
there on either end of the floor 
to be able to capitalize on any 
type of opportunity that we have, 
to be honest with you. There’s 
nothing we’re doing well.
“You know, there’s nowhere 
to go. You just move on to the 
next step, try to figure it out, 
and you’ve got to find a way to 
get some confidence in yourself, 
which for us is a preparation to 
go on the road and play Rutgers, 
so that’s what we’re worried 
about right now. But playing 
against the level of competition 
in this league right now and 
what we’ve got going on, we’re 
just not playing at a high enough 
level, and that really, really to be 
honest with you, bothers me.”
But Indiana isn’t the only team 
that will look back at the month 
of January as one filled with 
squandered opportunities. The 
Big Ten can boast depth right 
now — only four of its teams are 
out of tournament contention 
— yet, outside of the Wolverines 
and Spartans, who suffered their 

first conference loss Saturday, no 
team feels like a lock to make the 
NCAA Tournament right now.
Things will be better for the 
conference, undoubtedly, than 
last year, when just four teams 
made it. Joe Lunardi’s latest 
Bracketology on ESPN.com has 
10 Big Ten teams making it, more 
than any other conference.
But 
cannibalism 
has 
its 
downsides, 
and 
discomfort 
is one. Well, for everyone but 
Michigan, that is.
Instead 
of 
fretting 
about 
actually playing in March, as the 
Wolverines were at this time last 
year, they can go into Tuesday’s 
contest against Ohio State — and 
the final five weeks of the regular 
season — worrying only about 
playing at their best when they 
get there.
“Sunday we had a really good 
workout,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“We 
spent some time lifting weights. 
Spent time on Michigan instead 
of worrying quite as much about 
the next opponent.”
Three days earlier, Beilein had 
been asked about the challenge 
in front of Miller — building 
Indiana back into a perennial 
contender, as Beilein had to do 
for Michigan. To some degree, 
though, you could replace the 
Hoosiers with 11 other Big Ten 
teams in that question.
But the Wolverines are above 
the fray.

Michigan coach John Beilein has kept Michigan safely above the Big Ten’s middle ground with an 8-1 conference record.

Michigan falls to Baylor

Applause and cries of “Go 
Blue!” echo off the walls of the 
Varsity Tennis Center. All eyes 
are on Court 2 as Michigan’s 
Connor Johnston and Harrison 
Brown face off against Baylor’s 
Roy Smith and Sven Lah. Coaches 
murmur words of advice to their 
players, while teammates shout 
words of encouragement from 
the sidelines. Then, all at once, 
the crowd retreats into silence. 
There’s a loud pop as the 
ball is hit into play. A smacking 
sound as Brown returns the 
serve. Then, once again, the 
crowd erupts into cheers, as 
Brown’s shot flies past Smith’s 
outstretched racket and the ball 
bounces once, then twice, off 
the court, lifting the Wolverines 
past the Bears to earn Michigan 
the doubles point of the contest. 
The No. 24 Wolverines (1-2) 
won two out of three doubles 
matches Sunday, a bright spot 
in a disheartening loss to No. 11 
Baylor, who will move forward 
to the ITA tournament following 
Sunday’s win and a win Saturday 
over No. 12 Georgia. 
“It was great that we were 
able to win the doubles on a 
tiebreaker,” said Michigan coach 
Adam Steinberg. “That’s really 
important to us going forward.”
In singles, Michigan was 
not able to put on as strong a 
showing, losing four of their 

six matches to the Bears. The 
Wolverines got off to a strong 
start, with four of the singles 
players winning the first set of 
their respective matches, but 
they could not hold onto the 
lead. 
Freshman Andrew Fenty lost 
to Baylor’s Johannes Schretter 
2-6, 6-3, 6-4; Senior Myles 
Schalet lost to Will Little of the 
Bears 7-6 (9), 6-0; Johnston lost 
to Matias Soto of Baylor 6-2, 
2-6, 6-3; and freshman Patrick 
Maloney lost to Lah 6-4, 7-6 (4).
“We just have to work on being 
more aggressive at important 
times in the match,” Steinberg 
said. “We kind of sit back and 
hope and wait and wish the 
other team will miss. And it just 
doesn’t work that way against 
these top-ranked teams.”
Michigan’s technical prowess 
was on full display on Sunday, 
as the Wolverines often used 
shots with a manipulated spin 
on the ball to win points against 
the Bears, especially during the 
singles matches. The Wolverines 
were also very successful when 
they attacked at the net. The 
volley game was mostly a factor 
in the doubles, helping the 
Wolverines to win their two out 
of three matches. 
“Some of the guys who have 
a good feel for the ball can 
manipulate it, and that’s an 
advantage,” 
Steinberg 
said. 
“Some of our guys are talented 
enough to do that.”

Michigan’s doubles play was a bright spot in its loss to Baylor.

Three takeaways from a split against Penn State

After beating Penn State on 
Thursday, the Michigan hockey 
team went to New York City 
looking to build off momentum. It 
did the exact opposite, losing 5-2.
Here are the takeaways.
Strauss Mann is still a viable 
option
After five goals through two 
periods, junior goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne was pulled in favor of 
Strauss Mann. The freshman, with 
13 games under his belt, was put in 
the game for a change of pace. Up 
until that point, every breakaway, 
odd 
man 
rush 
or 
defensive 
breakdown for the Wolverines 
resulted in a dangerous scoring 
opportunity for the Nittany Lions 
— which more often than not 
resulted in a score.
While 
the 
circumstances 
weren’t pretty, Mann took his 
chance and showcased a good 
argument for why he is still a viable 
option.
In his start in net Jan. 8 
against Merrimack — his last 
appearance before Saturday — 
Mann allowed three goals on a 
.889 save percentage, and Lavigne 
was subsequently chosen to start 
the following back-to-back games 
against Ohio State.
However, 
when 
given 
the 
opportunity against Penn State, 
Mann recorded 19 saves, prevent 
any further Nittany Lion goals and 
gave Michigan a chance to come 
back. His performance included 
stops on breakaways, one-on-
none looks and defensive-zone 
turnovers.
“We really like him as a 
goaltender, and we think he has a 
bright future at Michigan,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. “I 
didn’t want to have to get him in 
like we did but he went in and I give 
him credit, that’s a tough situation 
to go in and he played extremely 
well. He gave us an opportunity to 
try and get back into the game.”
Mentality breakdown
The Wolverines committed a 
plethora of errors Saturday, but 

one especially prevalent reason 
for the defensive meltdown was 
mentality.
After hitting the post four times, 
unable to convert any chances 
in the first period, frustration 
mounted. As Pearson noted, the 
team outplayed Penn State in the 
initial period yet found itself in a 
three-goal deficit.
“I 
think 
we 
got 
a 
little 
frustrated with that,” said redshirt 
sophomore Luke Morgan on the 
team’s inability to break open 
scoring in the first frame. “When 
that happens, it led to mental 
mistakes and some of it we can 
work on, but sometimes it’s just the 
way the game goes.”
The team made a mental 
adjustment to play differently due 
to its circumstances. As Pearson 
put it, the Wolverines didn’t play 
their game. And it was initiated 
by the new aggression they played 
with after conceding the first goal 
to Penn State.
Michigan became desperate for 
goals, and it caused the Wolverines 
to make defensive mistakes.
“Some of that could have been 
the frustration because the puck 
wasn’t going in the net and it 
doesn’t work that way,” Pearson 
said. “... We did not get the result 

we 
wanted. 
Very 
frustrating 
in the locker room because we 
know we’re a better team. We 
beat ourselves tonight, plain and 
simple.”
Defensemen pushing further 
than they needed to be. Players 
being less than careful with 
the puck. Allowing breakaways 
due to poor positioning. These 
on-ice mistakes were caused by 
the mental mistake of being too 
frustrated. Every player wanted 
to end the unlucky streak of bad 
bounces, and that ended up costing 
them.
“We didn’t play on the right side 
of the puck,” Pearson said. “We did 
not sense danger –– and I don’t 
want to say our whole team, but 
a few individuals. We just didn’t 
sense that urgency or the danger 
and they made us pay.”
Added Morgan: “Coach said, 
‘We can’t outscore our mistakes, 
we have to play a solid 60 (minutes) 
the whole way through.’ ”
Pearson doubts decisions
Pearson had his doubts in his 
decisions. Being a coach is never 
easy — it requires all sorts of 
decision-making. Against Notre 
Dame on Jan. 5, he made it clear 
just how stressful it can be, jokingly 
telling people to turn away from a 

coaching career.
“It’s frustrating –– chances 
at the open net, our defenseman 
ices the puck when we had an 
opportunity to make a play,” 
Pearson said about his feelings in 
the last stretch of the Notre Dame 
outdoor game. “And they score on 
the faceoff. … It’s a rush, and there’s 
nothing like it when you’re playing 
sports at a high-intensity level.”
That stress came despite a win.
Throughout the season, he had 
expressed his concerns as a coach. 
After extended breaks or holidays, 
he might mention in passing 
about worries on players’ focus or 
preparedness.
On Saturday, he made it clear his 
concerns on his decisions leading 
to the New York experience.
“I second guess myself as a 
coach all the time,” Pearson said. 
“You’re always worried. We didn’t 
get to skate on Friday. Should 
we have practice on Friday? We 
skated this morning, did that have 
anything to do with it? We gave 
them a lot of free time yesterday 
in New York, did they go around 
and do their thing? Did that throw 
some guys off?”
Coaches have their fair share 
of worries, but these worries have 
weight.

D

uring the first quarter of 
Sunday’s game at Crisler 
Center, Nicole Munger 
fell to the floor, only getting up 
with the aid of her teammates 
and the Michigan training staff.
The senior 
guard Munger 
sat out the 
remainder of 
the contest 
against in-
state rival, No. 
23 Michigan 
State, with an 
undisclosed 
injury. The 
Wolverines 
struggled in 
her absence, eventually digging 
themselves deeper into a hole they 
couldn’t climb out of, losing 77-73.
With the defeat, Michigan fell 
to 3-6 in conference play — tied for 
10th in the Big Ten. Though the 
Wolverines are out of the running 
for a regular-season crown and 
are unlikely to win the Big Ten 
Tournament beginning in just 
over a month, viewing the team’s 
struggles in a vacuum yields an 
incomplete assessment of their 
season.
Munger’s injury is just another 
line on a laundry list of adversities 
Michigan has faced.
Most Big Ten programs went 
through turnover following last 
season. Five of the conference’s 
top seven scorers moved on from 
college. With that said, only one 
of them finished first on their pro-
gram’s all-time leading scorer list: 
Michigan’s Katelynn Flaherty.
Coming into the season, most of 
the talk centered around Flaherty’s 
departure, and rightly so. Replac-
ing your primary ball-handler and 
a three-time All Big Ten first team 

selection, with a freshman in Amy 
Dilk — albeit a five-star recruit 
— is clearly an adjustment and 
shouldn’t be overlooked.
The Wolverines are also 
extremely young. Of the eight 
players comprising the primary 
rotation, five are underclass-
men. While “one-and-dones” 
have become commonplace and 
seniors unusual in men’s college 
basketball, this isn’t the case on the 
women’s side. So, when Michigan 
trots out a largely inexperienced 
lineup, growing pains should be 
expected.
The Wolverines’ chances are 
hindered even more when their 
veterans, like Munger, are side-
lined due to injury. The notion that 
injuries can be used to explain a 
team’s struggles over the course of 
a season is widely discredited by 
the general sports populace. Every 
team deals with injuries, they 
say. While this is true to a degree, 
within the context of their season, 
the injuries faced by Michigan are 
important to mention.
When Munger went down on 
Sunday, the Spartans capitalized 
and their lead ballooned to double 
digits.
“In the locker room, we talked 
about the importance of under-
standing situations in the game,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico told reporters after the loss. 
“Whether it’s the first quarter, end 
of the second quarter or end of the 
game. Without your leadership 
and experience out on the floor 
though, they’re kinda learning on 
the job. These are some new situa-
tions that Amy is in, Deja (Church) 
is in. Even (sophomore forward 
Hailey Brown), who had to play 
outside a bit more. Michigan State 
had the experience edge over us 

for sure.”
Injuries have also hampered 
senior center Hallie Thome, the 
team’s second-leading scorer from 
last year. She experienced back 
spasms in early December and 
played limited minutes in the three 
games leading up to conference 
play.
Acclaimed resources define 
the word “excuse” as “to try and 
remove blame from.” Alternatively, 
a “reason” is a “statement offered 
in explanation or justification.” It 
is easy to label the above “adversi-
ties” as excuses for Michigan’s 
struggles this season. But if we’re 
being impartial, they’re better 
characterized as reasons.
The Wolverines’ 12-9 overall 
record through 21 games is far 
from inspiring, but within the con-
text of this season specifically, it 
shouldn’t be all that surprising.
Moreover, a majority of these 
losses have come by narrow mar-
gins. With the exception of losses 
to No. 10 Texas, No. 22 Marquette 
and No. 12 Minnesota, Michigan 
has been within double digits in 
the fourth quarter. Despite the 
adversity, the team has continued 
to fight. Michigan’s performance 
following Munger’s injury exem-
plified this fight. The team cut the 
Spartans’ lead to just four points 
multiple times in the fourth quar-
ter. The desired results may have 
been lacking at times this season, 
but a positive mentality has been 
maintained throughout.
“Obviously we have a lot of 
fight,” Dilk said. “Like you said, it 
was a rivalry game, everybody was 
fired up to play. I think it shows a 
lot of growth too. We were down 
by a lot in the Ohio State game, 
too, and we came back to win. 
Unfortunately, today that didn’t 
happen, but we don’t give up. We’ll 
continue to fight.”
Back in November, Munger 
expressed aspirations of winning 
the program’s first Big Ten Cham-
pionship. That dream is now all 
but unattainable. Still criticizing 
this year’s Wolverines without 
realizing the reasons behind their 
struggles isn’t fair to anyone.
