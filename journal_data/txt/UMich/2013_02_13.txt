GOVERNMENT
Pres. makes
emotional
appeal for
gun control

'U' experts laud
Obama's fifth
State of the Union
. By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
Daily StaffReporter
On Tuesday night, President
Barack Obama gave the first
State of the Union address of
his second term in office.
While Obama did discuss
issues such as the federal debt,
immigration reform and the
status of the U.S. economy,
the address focused primar-
ily on education and gun con-
trol, which has galvanized the
nation since the Newtown,
Conn. elementary school shoot-
ing that left 27 dead.
"Because in the two months
since Newtown, more than a
thousand birthdays, gradua-
tions and anniversaries have
been stolen from our lives by a
bullet from a gun," Obama said
in his address.
Michael Heaney, an assis-
tant professor of organizational
studies and political science,

said the strategy of pushing for
a vote on gun control within
the speech without a specifi-
cally partisan slant will likely
advance Obama's legislative
goals.
"Probably the most effective
part of the speech was where
he said, 'They deserve a vote,'
and he kept repeating that,"
Heaney said. "That's a really
smart strategy because he's not
saying, 'You're a Republican,
and you have to support these
measures that you don't agree
with."'
Heaney added that because
the American people are mostly
in favor of more stringent gun
restrictions, he believes the
proposed measures are pass-
able.
"The reason why that is a
particularly effective strat-
egy is that is has the prospect
of forcing all these people in
Congress to basically go on the
record and vote against what
would be fairly popular mea-
sures," Heaney said.
During the speech, Obama
also rallied for Democrats and
Republicans to bring together

Spartans hand
Michigan its worst
loss since 2007 in
23-point rout
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
EAST LANSING - Flanked by
Brady Hoke, Greg Mattison and
Lloyd Carr, Zack Novak could do
nothing but look on and shake his
head from behind the visitor's
bench as chants of "overrated"

rained down on the No. 4 Michi-
gan basketball team.
Two years earlier, Novak's
grittiness and toughness willed
the Wolverines to an upset over
the Spartans at the Breslin Cen-
ter, but Tuesday, Michigan was
not only outmatched physically,
but also out-hustled and out-
worked time and time again. The
eighth-ranked Spartans flexed
an impressive inside-outside
domination, winning 75-52 in
what Michigan State coach Tom
Izzo called his team's best game
in three years.
After its previous three losses.

came by a combined 14 points,
little could salvage the embar-
rassment of Michigan's 23-point
defeat at the hands of its in-state
rival, the program's worst loss
since an 80-57 loss at home to
Purdue on Dec. 28, 2010.
"They came out early and
came at us all day long," said
redshirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan. "I just don't think we
brought it. With them playing the
way we were, it's hard to compete
in a game like that.
"As a whole, we just didn't
show up today. ... I hope us as
a team, I hope we realize what

happened today - that's just not
okay."
With the win, Michigan State
(10-2 Big Ten, 21-4 overall)
assumed sole possession of first
place in the Big Ten.
The Spartansbeat Michigan in
nearly every phase of the game,
including a decisive win on the
glass, 40-28, which included 14
offensive boards that led to 18
second-chance points.
"Hunger, pride, hustle points,
hustle plays, rebounding, defense
- all the things that you can con-
trol, we didn'tdothattoday," said

4-1 ruling says
law does not
legalize sales
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily Staff Reporter
Medical marijuana laws
are still a smoking-hot topic in
Michigan courts.
Last Friday, the Michigan
Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1
decision that patient-to-patient
medical marijuana dispensa-
ries are illegal after an ongo-.
ing trial involving a dispensary
based in Mount Pleasant, Mich.
The court ruled that the sale
of marijuana is not protected
by the Michigan Medical Mari-
juana Act, and is therefore out-
side the law. A court document
said "patient-to-patient sales
... do not qualify for immunity
because they encompass mar-
ijuana-related conduct that is
not for the purpose of alleviat-
ing the transferor's debilitating
medical condition or its symp-
toms."
The disputed dispensary,
Compassionate Apothecary,
was found to have been in vio-

lation of the MMMA on the
grounds that the business was
facilitating patient-to-patient
transfers. The dispensary is
now closed.
Compassionate Apothecary
operated by allowing registered
medical marijuana users to rent
lockers in which to store mari-
juana plants that could be sold
to other registered patients or
caregivers.
The case began when a
Mount Pleasant County pros-
ecuter filed a complaint against
Compassionate Apothecary,
claimingthatthe operationwas
not legal under the MMMA and
a public nuisance.
The first court to preside
over the case found Compas-
sionate Apothecary not guilty,
but after a lengthy legal process
the state of Michigan took the
case to the state Supreme Court
in October 2012.
In order to remain within
the law, registered patients are
expected to purchase medical
marijuana from state-approved
caregivers, or grow the plant
themselves. However, the law
does not provide guidance on
how to purchase marijuana

ByAMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
With Central Student Gov-
ernment's elections just around
the corner. LSA freshman Nick

Swider announced he will run
for the CSG presidency with
LSA junior Jill Clancy as his
running mate. They are the sec-
ond confirmed candidates for
the 2013 election cycle.
Clancy currently serves as
the chief programming officer
for CSG. Swider was selected by
current CSG President Manish
Parikh last semester to serve as
an intern under Clancy's leader-

ship. Through workingtogether
on student government initia-
tives, Swider and Clancy real-
ized that they would be "perfect
candidates."
The duo decided Swider
should run for the presidency
- because he has more time to
give to the job, Clancey said.
Despite the fact that Clancy is
a year ahead of Swider, she said

Shootout in Los
Angeles ends in
death of at least
two people

The Saginaw Chippewa Indian
Tribe plans to expand its Sagan-
ing Eagles Landing Casino in
Michigan.
The Morning Sun of Mount
Pleasant and MLive.com report
the tribe announced plans Mon-
day for the casino near Standish,
about 120 miles northwest of
Detroit.
The current 32,900-square-
foot casino would see the addition
of about 90,000 more square feet,
including 150 hotel rooms, a diner
and more gambling space.
Plans call for work to begin
later this year. The tribe hopes to
complete construction in spring
2014 and says the project will add
about 250 full- and part-time jobs.

Three people were shot to

may have been involved.
Investigators said a person
inside the house reported the
shooting in Midvale at about 8
" a.m.
Unified Police Department Lt.
Justin Hoyal said a search war-
rant had been served at the resi-
dence in recent weeks for drug
activity. "It was a known narcot-

The house backs up to a sound

struggles with
marijuana safety
Marijuana may be coming
out of the black market in Colora-
do and Washington state, but the
drug, at least for now, will retain
a decidedly underground feel:
Users may not know what's in it.
Less than a year away from
allowing pot sales, regulators
are grappling with how to ensure
that the nation's first legal mari-
juana industry will grow weed
that delivers only the effects that
pot smokers want.
Whether it is establishing
rules to govern the growing of
marijuana, including the use
of pesticides and fungicides, or
accurate product labeling, offi-
cials know they will be doing it
alone.
Federal agencies that regu-
late food and drugs are staying
out because pot remains illegal
under federal law. That means
the states are starting from
scratch to protect consumers
from pot that could be tainted
by mold, mildew or unwanted
chemicals.
ALEPPO, SYRIA

Rebels advance
toward Aleppo
airport
Rebels captured a small mili-
tary base near Aleppo on Tuesday
and stormed another in the same
area that protects a major airport,
a day after seizing Syria's largest
dam.
With the back-to-back blows to
President Bashar Assad's regime,
opposition fighters appear to
be regaining some momentum,
expanding their northern zone
of control while at the same time
pushing deeper into the heart of
the capital, Damascus.
Rebels have been attack-
ing Aleppo's civilian airport,
which remains in regime hands,
for weeks. They now appear to
have removed the main defens-
es around the facility. Civilian
flights stopped weeks ago because
of the intensity of the fighting.

N. Korea conducts nuclear
test despite U.N. warnings

United States
issues strong
condemnation
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - Defying U.N. warnings,
North Korea on Tuesday con-
ducted its third nuclear test in
the remote, snowy northeast,
taking a crucial step toward its
goal of building a bomb small
enough to be fitted on a missile
capable of striking the United
States.
North Korea said the atom-
ic test was merely its "first
response" to what it called U.S.
threats, and said it will con-
tinue with unspecified "second
and third measures of greater
intensity" if Washington main-
tains its hostility.
The underground test, which
set off powerful seismic waves,
drew immediate condemnation
from Washington, the U.N. and
others. Even its only major ally,
China, summoned the North's
ambassador for a dressing-
down.
President Barack Obama,
who was scheduled to give a
State of the Union address later
Tuesday, said nuclear tests "do
not make North Korea more
secure." Instead, North Korea
has "increasingly isolated
and impoverished its people
through its ill-advised pursuit
of weapons of mass destruc-
tion," he said in a statement.
But the Obama administra-
tion's options for a response
are limited, and a U.S. military
strike is highly unlikely.
In an emergency session, the
U.N. Security Council unani-
mously said the test poses "a
clear threat to internation-
al peace and security" and

pledged further action.
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice
called the test "highly pro-
vocative" and said the North's
continued work on its nuclear
and missile programs threat-
ens regional and international
peace and security and "the
security of a number of coun-
tries including the United
States."
"They will not be tolerated,"
she said, "and they will be met
with North Korea's increasing
isolation and pressure under
United Nations sanctions."
It remains to be seen, how-
ever, whether China will sign
on to any new, binding global
sanctions. Beijing, Pyongyang's
primary trading partner, has
resisted measures that would
cut off North Korea's economy
completely.
China expressed firm oppo-
sition to Tuesday's test but
called for a calm response by
all sides. Chinese Foreign Min-
ister Yang Jiechi summoned
North Korea's ambassador and
delivered a "stern representa-
tion" and demanded that North
Korea "swiftly return to the
correct channel of dialogue and
negotiation," the ministry said
in a statement.
The test was a defiant North
Korean response to U.N. orders
that it shut down its atomic
activity or face more sanctions
and international isolation. It
will likely draw more sanctions
from the United States and
other countries at a time when
North Korea is trying to rebuild
its moribund economy and
expand its engagement with
the outside world.
Several U.N. resolutions bar
North Korea from conducting
nuclear or missile tests because
the Security Council considers

Pyongyang a would-be pro-
liferator of weapons of mass
destruction and its nuclear
testing a threat to internation-
al peace and stability. North
Korea dismisses that as a dou-
ble standard, and claims the
right to build nuclear weapons
as a defense against the Unit-
ed States, which it has seen as
Enemy No. 1 since the 1950-53
Korean War. The U.S. stations
more than 28,000 troops in
South Korea to protect its ally.
Tuesday's test is North
Korea's first since young leader
Kim Jong Un took power of a
country long estranged from
the West. The test will likely
be portrayed in North Korea
as a strong move to defend the
nation against foreign aggres-
sion, particularly from the U.S.
"The test was conducted in a
safe and perfect way on a high
level, with the use of a small-
er and light A-bomb, unlike
the previous ones, yet with
great explosive power," North
Korea's official Korean Central
News Agency said.
The U.N. Security Council
recently punished North Korea
for a rocket launch in Decem-
ber that the U.N. and Washing-
ton called a cover for a banned
long-range missile test. Pyong-
yang said it was a peaceful
launch of a satellite into space.
In condemning that launch,
the council demanded a stop
to future launches and ordered
North Korea to respect a ban on
nuclear activity - or face "sig-
nificant action" by the U.N.
The timing of Tuesday's test
is significant. It came hours
before Obama's speech and
only days before the Satur-
day birthday of Kim Jong Un's
father, late leader Kim Jong II,

Former LAPD
officer engages in
shootout, kills at
least one person
BIG BEAR, Calif. (AP) - The
extraordinary manhunt for the
former Los Angeles police offi-
cer suspected of three murders
converged Tuesday on a moun-
tain cabin where authorities
believe he barricaded himself
inside, engaged in a shootout
that killed a deputy and then
never emerged as the home
went up in flames.
A single gunshot was heard
from within, and a charred
body was found inside.
Ifthe man inside proves toube
Christopher Dorner, as author-
ities suspect, the search for the
most wanted man in America
over the last week would have
ended the way he had expected
- death, with the police pursu-
ing him.
Thousands of officers had
been on the hunt for the for-
mer Navy reservist since police
said he launched a campaign
to exact revenge against the
Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment for his firing. They say he
threatened to bring "warfare"
to officers and their families,
spreading fear and setting off
a search for him across the
Southwest and Mexico.
"Enough is enough. It's time
for you to turn yourself in. It's
time to stop the bloodshed,"
LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith
said at a news conference held
outside police headquarters in
Los Angeles, a starkly differ-
ent atmosphere than last week
when officials briefed the news
media under tight security with
Dorner on the loose.
A short time after Smith
spoke Tuesday, smoke began
to rise from the cabin in the
snow-covered woods near Big
Bear Lake, a resort town about
80 miles east of Los Ange-
les. Flames then engulfed the
building - images that were
broadcast on live television
around the world. TV helicop-
ters showed the fire burning
freely with no apparent effort
to extinguish it.
"We have reason to believe
that it is him," said San Ber-
nardino County sheriff's
spokeswoman Cynthia Bach-
man, adding that she didn't
know how the fire started.
She noted there was gunfire
between the person in the
cabin and officers around the
home before the blaze began.
Until Tuesday, authorities
didn't know whether Dorner
was still near Big Bear Lake,
where they found his burned-
out pickup last week.
Around 12:20 p.m. Tues-
day, deputies got a report of a
stolen pickup truck, authori-
ties said. The location was

directly across the street from
where law enforcement set up
their command post on Thurs-
day and not far from where
Dorner's pickup was aban-
doned. The owner of the vehi-
cle taken Tuesday described
the suspect as looking similar
to Dorner.
A warden for the California
Department of Fish and Wild-
life traveling down Highway
38 recognized a man who fit
Dorner's description traveling
in the opposite direction. The
officer pursued the vehicle
and there was a shooting at
12:42 p.m. in which the wild-
life vehicle was hit numerous
times and the suspect escaped
on foot after crashing his
truck.
After holing up in the cabin,
there was a second gunbattle
with San Bernardino County
deputies, two of whom were
shot. One died and the other
was expected to live after
undergoing surgery.
"We're heartbroken," Big
Bear Lake Mayor Jay Obernolte
said of the deputy's death and
the wounding of his colleague.
"Words can't express ho'v
grateful we are for the sacri-
fice those men have made in
defense of the community and
our thoughts and prayers are
with them and their families."
The man believed to be
Dorner never came out of the
cabin, and a single shot was
heard inside before the cabin
was engulfed in flames, a law
enforcement official told The
Associated Press.
The official later told the
AP that a charred body was
found in the burned cabin. The
official requested anonymity
because of the ongoing investi-
gation.
Officials were waiting for
the fire to burn out before
approaching the ruins to search
for a body.
Police say Dorner began his
run on Feb. 6 after they con-
nected the slayings of a former
police captain's daughter and
her fiance with an angry Face-
book rant they said he posted.
Threats against the LAPD led
officials to assign officers to
protect officers and their fami-
lies.
Within hours of the release
of photos of the 6-foot,
270-pounder described as

Gay marriage bill passes
in France's lower house

Nation on track to
join a dozen mostly
European nations in
legalization
PARIS (AP) - France's lower
house of parliament approved
a sweeping bill on Tuesday to
legalize gay marriage and allow
same-sex couples to adopt chil-
dren, handing a major legislative
victory to President Francois
Hollande's Socialists on a divi-
sive social issue.
The measure, approved in the
National Assembly in a 329-to-
229 vote, puts France on track
to join about a dozen mostly
European nations that allow gay
marriage and comes despite a
string of recent demonstrations
by opponents of the so-called
"marriage for all" bill.
Polls indicate a narrow major-
ity of French support legalizing
gay marriage, though that sup-
port falls when questions about
the adoption and conception of
children come into play.
The Assembly has been
debating the bill, and voting on
its individual articles in recent
weeks. The overall legislation
now goes in the coming weeks
to the Senate, which also is con-
trolled by the governing Social-

ists and their allies.
With Tuesday's vote, France
joins Britain in taking a major
legislative step in recent weeks
toward allowing gay marriage
and adoption - making them
the largest European countries
to do so. The Netherlands, Bel-
gium, Norway and Spain, as well
as Argentina, Canada and South
Africa have authorized gay mar-
riage, along with nine U.S. states
and the District of Columbia.
The issue has exposed fault
lines between a progressive-
minded leftist legislative major-
ity in officially secular France,
and the country's conservative
religious roots. Critics - includ-
ing many Roman Catholics -
have railed that the bill would
erode the traditional family.
Socialists, however, sought to
depict the issue as one of equal
rights, and they played off
France's famed Revolution-era
motto of "Liberty, Equality and
Fraternity."
"This law is going to extend
to all families the protections
guaranteed by the institution of
marriage," Prime Minister Jean-
Marc Ayrault said before Tues-
day's vote. "Contrary to what
those who vociferate against it
say - fortunately they're in the
minority - this law is going to
strengthen the institution of
marriage."

As with many major and con-
troversial reforms in France, the
issue drew its share of political
grandstanding over weeks of
debate. Conservative opponents
forced a discussion of nearly
5,000 amendments, a move
derided by Socialists as inconse-
quential stalling tactics. But by
the final vote, the government
rank-and-file rolled out grand,
solemn statements of victory.
"This law is a first neces-
sary step, a social evolution that
benefits society overall," said
Socialist representative Corinne
Narassiguin, announcing her
party's support for the measure.
"Openingup marriage and adop-
tion to homosexual couples is a
very beautiful advance.... It is an
emblematic vote, a vote that will
mark history."
However, the political right
hasn't given up just yet, say-
ing the Constitutional Court -
whose 12 members include three
former French presidents and
several other prominent conser-
vatives - will determine wheth-
er the law, if finally passed,
meshes with the law of the land.
"So it's not the end of the
story yet," said Herve Mariton,
a member of the main opposi-
tion UMP party. "We still have
arguments to make and we want
to convince people that it is not a
good project."

Stating the Obvious
Obama's speech demands common sense from Congress
n Tuesday, Feb. 12, President Barack Obama delivered one
the more forceful and decisive speeches during his time in
office. The president called on the U.S. Congress to enact
common-sense legislation on immigration, jobs, gun violence and
taxes, while encouraging Americans to accept fully their obligation
to one another as citizens. Along with his typically lofty rhetoric
and demands for investment in new infrastructure, the President
described several new goals to revamp the U.S. economy, reform edu-
cation and bring equal opportunity to workers. Though Obama dis-
cussed crucial issues such as education reform, minimum wage and
immigration reform, he failed to fully address drone warfare and gay
rights, both of which deserved more attention.

Obama called for legitimate, comprehensive
education reform. He outlined a system of col-
laboration between schools, universities and
companies that would allow students to earn
a technical associate degree upon graduation
fromhighschool.Reformssimilar tothis would
improve the education system, strengthen our
economy and equip young people with the tools
necessary to find work in a suffering economy.
However, schools must remain committed
to a well-rounded education - emphasizing
humanities and liberal arts values and occupa-
tions, as well.
Moreover, Obama called on colleges and uni-
versities to lower tuition costs, stating that in
order to successfully accomplish this feat, "col-
leges must do their part to keep costs down."
However, it's imperative that at the federal
and state level the government supports higher
education. Universities across the nation are
already strapped for cash. If the government
wants to make lower tuition a priority, it must
be willing to help colleges make the numbers
work with increased funding.
Obama also called for an increase in the
minimum wage - the first since 2009. The
president noted that even with tax relief and
government assistance, families on minimum
wage are below the poverty line. By increas-

ing the minimum wage to $9 an hour, low-
wage workers will be able to better provide
for themselves and their families - though
this increase will not nearly end the hardship
of our most needy citizens. Opposition will
likely point to increased costs for employers
and possible harm to the economy, but as the
president noted, corporate profits and CEO's
salaries are at all time high. Businesses must
be willing to sacrifice for the better of the
economy and the country.
Obama's address was one of his stronger
speeches in both delivery and content. His
demand that Congress get things done on a
common-sense basis seemed to shine through
stronger than everbefore. Obama and congres-
sional leadership must implement legislation
for immigration reform, work to end gun vio-
lence and pass the Violence Against Women
Act. While the president has already proposed
these measures, he failed to mention key issues
that cannot be avoided. Obama only subtly
alluded to gay rights, and he brushed over his
administration's controversial use of drone
warfare and extra-judicial killings. These top-
ics may be controversial, but the president is no
longer facinga re-election, so he must live up to
the promises he's made as a candidate - striv-
ingfor equality, peace and true progress.

For the past four years,
Americans have been wait-
ing for the solution to the
economy they
thought would
have come
sooner. Four
years ago, in
his-first State
of the Union
address, Presi-
dent Barack PAUL
Obama said that SHERMAN
Americans had
to "answer his-
tory's call" in the light of a poten-
tial "second depression." This time,
as he entered the House chamber
and looked in the television cam-
eras for a fifth time, he focused on
the idea that creating middle class
jobs must be the "North Star that
guides our (economic) efforts."
while there are many important
issues that face this country, I was
pleased that the president brought
up manufacturing. He said that
Washington must "guarantee that
the next revolution in manufactur-
ing is made in America." With the
Republicans reeling and looking
to find support, Obama must strike
a bipartisan agreement on the fis-
cal issues facing this country. Now
is the time for Congress to finally
make America a "magnet for jobs
and manufacturing."
Though there have been signs
of erosion, the American manufac-
turing industry is still one of the
largest in the world. A Jan. 2012
Congressional Research Service
report found that America's share
of global manufacturing activity has
decreased in recent years. China's
manufacturing sector is almost as
large as in the United States, val-
ued at $1.814 trillion and $1.756 tril-
lion respectively. In Dec. 2012, the
manufacturing sector made modest

gains in manufacturing activity and
factory hiring.
One of the common arguments
related to manufacturing thrown
around recently is that American
companies are outsourcing jobs to
other countries because their labor
laws allow manufacturing opera-
tionstobe moreprofitable. However,
this is not as big of an issue as most
Americans think it is. As the Bureau
of Labor Statistics has found, the
effect of outsourcing has been mini-
mal. In the third quarter of 2012,
when more than 100,000 workers
were laid off, firms told BLS that less
than 1 percent of these workers had
their jobs moved to another country.
An article from The Atlantic
reported that American companies
are seeing the economic benefits of
keeping jobs in America and have, in
fact, started to "insource" jobs. Chi-
na's Foxconn, the Chinese manufac-
turing giant, is actually planning on
increasing their operations in the
United States. American companies
are realizing the benefits of keeping
jobs in the U.S., which will limit the
effect that outsourcing will have on
the economy.
On the other hand, what's pre-
venting companies from producing
in the United States is the attrac-
tiveness of production in other
countries. Part of the issue is that
the value of the dollar made pro-
ducing goods in the United States
less attractive than other countries
with cheaper labor and production
costs and lower marginal tax rates.
If America wants to become more
competitive in this regard, the fed-
eral government must be willing to
create a plan that provides subsidies
and "lowers tax rates for businesses
and manufactures that (will) create
jobs right here in America." This
would help reduce the costs of pro-
duction in the U.S., which would

make companies more willing to
attract new jobs without having to
reduce workers' salaries.
Obama's plan will
make America more
competitive.
One point that President Obama
has been stressing is that increas-
ing our focus onalternative energy
will make America a stronger man-
ufacturing country. According the
Department of Energy, in Aug. 2012
the wind sector was employing
"75,000 American workers, includ-
ing workers at manufacturing facil-
ities up and down the supply chain,
as well as engineers and construc-
tion workers who build and operate
the wind farms." People are now
feeling the benefits of alternative
energy manufacturing. On top of
providing jobs, it will help Ameri-
cans save money on energy con-
sumption. This is the direction the
manufacturing sector is going. If
we fail to recognize the importance
of alternative energy, America will
fall behind.
Manufacturing is what has driven
America over the past century. If we
plan to give up on manufacturing,
we are throwing the future of this
country away. But words can only go
so far. This plan will not completely
revive the American car industry
or the steel industry. While it's not
complete, President Obama's plan
will make American manufacturing
industry more competitive that it is
today so that we can be authors of
the next great chapter in our Ameri-
can story.

"T he best part about
going to the Oscars is
telling people you're
going to the
Oscars. Even
my mom, who's
been my date
for the last two
years, she says
that the best
part is telling
her hairstylist JOSEPH
in Pennsylvania HORTON
that she's going
to the Oscars."
My friend Mary
Howard, who works for the Acade-
my of Motion Picture Arts and Sci-
ences, is making her third trip to
the Oscars this year. "The second
best part is the moment you walk
in you're handed a glass of, like,
Cristal champagne. A lot of people
are drunk."
I've been to the Academy Awards
ceremony precisely once. And by
"been," I mean I've stood outside,
beyond the security cordon, neck
craned for a starry glimpse. And by
"ceremony," I mean the bejeweled,
self-congratulatory apex of the Hol-
lywood fame mountain. From a dis-
tance, I've loved, and been frustrated
by, the Oscars forever. I've known
film-school friends nominated for
their work, and I've written about
the Academy's odder choices and
the ripple effects that one bad win
can have over decades. However,
ever since that moment of false inti-
macy at the corner of Hollywood and
Highland, I've wondered what the
Oscars really mean.
Mary's Oscar day starts at 10:30
a.m. with hair and makeup. "I do
my mom's makeup, and I do my
own hair," she says, "and we try to
arrive early. I walk not the fancy
red carpet, but the side red carpet.
It's basically the same as the red
carpet except it's full of people say-
ing 'keep it moving."'
The highlight of the day for com-
moners and celebrities alike, she

explains, is watching the arrivals.
"When everyone was arriving, Tea
Leoni was standingnext to me on this
little overhang pointing out celeb-
rities just like the rest of us." Mary
admits her most significant celebrity
encounter was John Williams, the
movie-score maestro himself.
"John Williams once told me
that I was nice. Nobody's opinion
matters anymore but his. Next time
someone calls me a bitch, it doesn't
matter, because John Williams
thinks I'm nice."
When the show begins, Mary
sits in the second-to-last row of the
Dolby Theatre, where the steepness
of the auditorium puts the feet of
those sitting behind her squarely at
her head. "There's a free bar up until
15 minutes before the show, so when
people get drunk you can get kicked
in the head."
Provided your head doesn't get
kicked in, I think there's value in this
back-of-the-theatre view.Ambitionis
found in the cheap seats, and maybe a
measure of perspective accompanies
distance. Or, provided you're nattily
black-tied, there's similar value in
working as a seat-filler, as Mary's dad
did last year, and seeing, even for the
length of a commercial break, what it
might be like to one day have a VIP
seat for yourself. Maybe there's a
necessary measure of motivation to
earn this proximity and maybe, just
maybe, winning isn'teverything.
Now, I'm not falling back on the
old, "it's an honor just to be nomi-
nated" garbage or admitting that
streakers always steal theshow. I'm
not surrenderingto a SallyField pop-
ularity-check or acknowledging the
common slight that "nobody remem-
bers who won last year," referenced
by Kevin Costner in his acceptance
speech for "Dances with Wolves."
But I'm convinced that the Academy
Awards are most valuable for the
work they inspire. That statuette of a
naked golden man isn't really for the
person holding it on stage, no mat-
ter how many Jack Palance pushups

the winner does to show us he has
earned it. The Oscar at its best is a
down payment, a shiny anchor tossed
into the future to hold firm the film-
makers and artists watching, way
back in the Dolby rafters or at home
in Michigan, who will one day shape
the cinematic world.
Keep striving, keep
working and keep
dreaming.
"When the show's over, if you're
lucky, all of a sudden you're walking
next to winners with their Oscars
and you congratulate them," Mary
says. "Their families will be all in
the balcony, and they'll come back
up to show them their Oscar. The
people who win the shorts, the live
action and animated shorts, they're
the future. They are the ones that are
most inspired and affected by win-
ning an Oscar."
We live in a world obsessed with
instant fame and celebrity, which,
like the Oscars, can seem easy and
glamorous. On television we see the
first few rows of seats, populated by
the biggest stars, and maybe Mary's
dad, but we're offered little more
than a passing pan over the balco-
nies. The hope of those in the balco-
nies -'where people like Mary can
see the long-view of the Academy,
where short-film winners can see
the path ahead and down - keeps me
watching. To them, to all those who
do their own hair and makeup, who
are exiled to cash bars and foot/head
seats, who walk the "side red carpet"
and are presciently told to keep mov-
ing, I say keep going - keep striving,
keep working, keep dreaming and
keep drafting that acceptance speech
for the night you cast out the anchor.

PRESIDENT
From Page 1A
in order to build the economy.
"The American people don't
expect government to solve every
problem. They don't expect those
of us in this chamber to agree
on every issue," Obama said.
"But they do expect us to put the
nation's interests before party."
In an interview after the
address, Congressman John
Dingell (D-Mich.) agreed that in
order for the country to develop,
there needs to be more biparti-
sanship in congress.
"It's time for us to put aside
this absolutely asinine and vicious
partisanship that we've got and to
buckle down and to start working
together in the better interest of
our country," Dingell said. "And
I think that's something that
Americans desperately want."
Obama also emphasized that
the United States needs to lessen
its dependence on foreign energy.
He proposed items such as the
Energy Security Trust to invest in
research into alternative forms of
energy.
"Now is not the time to gut
these job-creating investments
in science and innovation. Now
is the time to reach a level of
research and development not
seen since the height of the Space
Race," Obama said. "Today, no
area holds more promise than our
investments in American energy."
Obama added that investment
in education will be an important
factor in the economic stability of
the country and proposed univer-
sal preschool.
"Every dollar we invest in
high-quality early education can
save more than seven dollars later
on - by boosting graduation rates,
reducing teen pregnancy, even
reducing violent crime," Obama
said.
Obama also said he wants to
redesign high schools to better
prepare graduates for the high-
tech job market, in addition to
continually working to make col-
lege more affordable.
Craig Ruff, a lecturer in the
Public Policy school, said he was
surprised that the president dis-
cussed investment in higher edu-
cation considering there haven't
been significant federal strides in
that area in the past.
"The president staked out a
new purpose for the federal gov-
ernment, one we've never seen
before - that was to provide an
affordable and valuable higher
education experience," Ruff said.
However, Ruff said he feels
that any attempts to make col-
lege more affordable won't have a
purpose if the job market doesn't
improve first.
"We are producing, every year,
extraordinary talent among high-
school graduates, community
college graduates, college gradu-
ates, bachelor's graduates, MBAs
- and that's all well and good, but
what jobs will they fill?" Ruff said.
While it remains to be seen
how much of Obama's agenda will
result in policy, Dingell said he is
proud of the president's speech.
"He is judged by his suc-
cess, but he's also judged by his
leadership." Dingell said. "The
people heard, and I'm satisfied

they approved what he said. And
I intend to do anything I can to
assist him to accomplish his pur-
poses."

junior guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. when asked why the game
turned out so lopsided. "We've
got to play for the guys next to
us."
Like previous starts in
Columbus and Bloomington,
Michigan (8-4, 21-4) struggled
to find its footing in a hostile
environment, but unlike its
three previous road losses, the
Wolverines never put together
a run to get back within strik-
ing range. They trailed Michi-
gan State for the entirety of the
game, and the Spartans led by as
many as 31 points.
The Spartans used a 17-4
run to take a 16-point first-half
lead and entered the locker
room with a 38-24 advantage.
Not even halftime could slow
down the home team, which
didn't skip a beat. Sophomore
point guard Trey Burke's and-1
pulled Michigan to within 12
points just minutes into the
second half, but Michigan State

responded with a 21-7 run to
take a 62-36 lead just moments
after the second official timeout
of the half.
Michigan had no answer for
the bigger Spartan frontcourt.
Michigan State grabbed nearly
as many first-half offensive
rebounds (seven) as Michi-
gan had total boards (11). The
Spartans' frontcourt combined
to shoot 11-for-14 in the open-
ing stanza, good for 24 points.
Guard Gary Harris led Michi-
gan State with 17 points thanks
to five 3-pointers.
Forward Derrick Nix scored
14 points on 6-for-9 shooting, as
the Spartans shot 48.4 percent
from the field, even after sev-
eral walk-ons missed late-game
shots. Even freshman forward
Matt Costello, who averaged
just 1.3 points and 1.1 rebounds,
got in the mix, scoring eight
points without missing a shot
while grabbing six boards.
"They just beat us up on the
offensive glass," Burke said.
"They went on a lot of runs,
scored off our turnovers. It was
just tough for us to get back in

front."
Burke had an efficient first
half on the offensive end, scoring
10 points on 4-of-5 shooting, but
two fouls caused him to sit, and
with freshman pointguard Spike
Albrecht quarterbacking, the
Michiganoffense had no rotation
or rhythm. Burke finished with a
game-high 18 points.
Freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III again looked trans-
parenton the offensive end. Rob-
inson made just one of his four
shots. Burke had no answers
when he was asked how Michi-
gan can get the freshman back
into the offensive mix.
"I don't know," Burke said. "I
just try to continue to give him con-
fidence and encourage him to have
a presence out there on the court.
He's young and he'll get better."
Hardaway Jr. missed all six
of his shots in the first half and
finished 1-for-11, scoring just
two points. Michigan turned the
ball over 16 times, more than six
above its season average.
"Don't think that's the real
Michigan team, because it's not,"
Izzo said.


CSG

seniority was not a decision-
making factor.
"(Swider's) ambition, drive
and enthusiasm really spoke
a lot to me," Clancy said. "We
just sat down and talked about
how we really are invested in
CSG and with that, here we are
today."
CSG program director Anika
Awai-Williams said since she
took her job in 2005, there have
been no freshman or sophomore
student body presidents. In fact,
she said she was unsure if a
freshman has ever run for presi-
dent.
Swider, however, doesn't see
his class standing as an impedi-
ment to his campaign and even
thinks it could be advanta-
geous.
"Seeing how the first year on
campus affects the next three
years,it'scritical thatIwork with
my fellow freshman and other
underclassman," Swider said. "A
lack of experience within other
political experience can be to my
true advantage because I do not
have anyone else to answer to but
students."

"I believe that 'freshman'
is just a label," Swider
added.
They will not run as indepen-
dent candidates, like CSG Presi-
dent Manish Parikh and CSG
Vice President Omar Hashwi
did last year. Instead, they are in
the process of forming a politi-
cal party to back their initiatives.
The structure and executive
board of the party are yet to be
confirmed.
On Sunday night, newly-
formed party forUM revealed
their election candidates and
platform for the election.
Clancy said forUM's
announcement would not rush
their current campaign timeline.
She said she and Swider want to
ensure that their campaign is
"perfected."
"We really want to focus and
we really want to strategize and
come up with the best team pos-
sible," Clancysaid. "If this means
coming out a little after forUM,
then that is okay."
Though the duo's platform
is yet to be finalized, Swider
said campaign promises would
include increasing CSG aware-
ness on campus through social
media initiatives and undertak-
ing efforts to ensure students are

able to interact with CSG execu-
tives on a personal level.
Competition is not a matter of
concern for the duo. Clancy said
seeing so many students com-
ing forward to run for office is
"refreshing" and shows a passion
for change on campus.
"We really want to focus on
the fact that other administra-
tions that have come into this
have made some unfortunate tall
and empty promises," Swider
said. "We are not looking to do
this."
Though CSG Vice President
Omar Hashwi is currently unde-
cided about whether or not he
will run for presidency nextyear,
he outlined the specific qualities
that he believed every CSG can-
didate should possess.
"(The candidate needs to)
have ambition, put the students'
needs first and be a good leader,"
Hashwi said. "Someone who has
the experience with implement-
ing things, delivering on their
platform ideas and whose plat-
form is actually the platform of
the students and not some gener-
ic platform."

didn't officially announce the
change until Tuesday, when
Parikh sent an e-mail to the
student body.
"(Students) needed a place
where they could grab a late
night coffee or late night
snack ... especially dur-
ing finals," Parikh said "We
believe that when students
are well-hydrated and well-
nourished - especially late
at night - it provides for the
better well-being and better
health."
University Unions facilitat-
ed the change by temporarily
increasing funding to cover the
added labor costs.
"Our absolute goal is to make
sure this is a self-sustaining
operation, but the University
Unions have been very kind
to front the initial (funding),"
Parikh said.
After the announcement
Tuesday, some students have
asked whether or not a similar
24-hour cafe would be opened
at the Duderstadt Center to
serve students living on North
Campus. However, Parikh said
there are no plans to imple-
ment a cafe at the Dude at this
time.
"It's definitely something
that we'll be looking to in the
future, especially if this pro-
gram is successful," Parikh
said.
Safety was another con-
cern regarding the 24-hour
schedule at Bert's. Because of
the later hours of operation
at least two employees will be
present during all late-night
shifts.
"This was our number-one
priority," Parikh said. "We had
to check out the safety ... before
we could move ahead with any-
thing. There have been no inci-
dents whatsoever so far and we
don't expect any incidents in
the future."
In addition to these chang-
es, Tuesday's e-mail notified
students that office hours
led by CSG leaders will now
be "Coffee Chats" at Bert's,
an effort to make the student
government more transpar-
ent.
"Our focus this year is
restoring Central Student
Government back to the stu-

dents and, in order to do
that, we must be 100-percent
approachable by any member
of our student body," Parikh
said.
CSG Vice President Omar
Hashwi said the traditional
office hours' location in the
group's chambers resulted
in inconsistent involve-
ment.
"We think if we can have
more of a presence on campus
- for people to be able to walk
by, see our name and ask us
questions - it would be better
for the student body," Hashwi
said.
Though the new format
involves meeting in a pub-
lic place, Hashwi said lead-
ers don't expect that their
meetings will inconvenience
patrons.
The process of transi-
tioning Bert's to a 24-hour
schedule required extensive
background work by staff at
University Unions. Food Ser-
vice Director Keith Soster said
the UGLi had to first success-
fully transition into a 24-hour
library before Bert's could
become an around-the-clock
cafe.
"We're going to pilot it
for winter semester to see
if it's going to be sustain-
able ... and then we're going
to take it from there," Sos-
ter said.
Logistically, Soster said Uni-
versity Unions found it chal-
lenging to staff the cafe during
the early morning hours, par-
ticularly between 2 a.m. and 7
a.m.
"It's difficult finding stu-
dents who would want to work
those hours, so that's one of the
cost factois," Soster said.
Soster cited the uncer-
tainty of staff availability
as the reason the 24-hour
cafe underwent a "quiet"
opening in mid-January.
Since then, he added, Uni-
versity Unions has begun to
advertise the new hours, a
move he said has increased
sales.
If CSG and University
Unions deem the project sus-
tainable, Bert's Cafe will likely
adopt the 24-hour schedule on
a permanent basis.

seeds or plants.
Former Compassionate Apoth-
ecary owners Brandon McQueen
and Matthew Taylor posted a
message on the business's website
commenting onthe ways in which
the medical marijuana business
helps Michigan's economy.
"Dispensing legal amounts of
medication to legally registered
patients registered with the state
of Michigan, and ID checked
every time, was just a small frac-
tion of what California did," the
couple wrote.

State Representative Jeff
Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said he's
upset with limits that have been
placed on the law, which he said
has turned out to be a failure.
"It costs hundreds of millions
of dollars just here in Michi-
gan to control marijuana laws,
and in the process negatively
impacts our productive capabil-
ity," Irwin said.
He noted that the court missed
the gravity of the definitions
clause - which that defines legal
terms used in the act - when first
draftingthe MMMA, and predicts
that dispensaries will begin to
change their business models to
avoid being deemed a public nui-

sance by local law enforcement.
Irwin said he has worked to
decriminalize the use and sale
of medical marijuana in order
to keep the product away from
potentially dangerous black-mar-
ket traders.
"Everything the government
does to drive the trade into the
shadows empowers violent
criminals," Irwin said. "I want to
bring the light of legitimacy into
these transactions so that we can
protect consumers."
LSA senior Nicholas Zettell, a
leader of Students for a Sensible
Drug Policy, said the recent deci-
sion will affect safe access for reg-
istered patients and caregivers.

Zettell also commented on
what he said was an increase in
dispensaries shut down by law
enforcement. In 2011, after the
original ruling on the Compas-
sionate Apothecary case, two
Ann Arbor dispensaries were
raided by the Michigan State
Police Livingston and Washt-
enaw Narcotics Enforcement
Team after investigation into
their activities.
One dispensary, MedMAR, had
picked up their official city appli-
cation to become a licensed dis-
pensary just four days before the
raid.
"I don't know if I can really
explain in words how tragic it

was to witness," Zettell said.
"Some people were held at gun-
point and taken to jail."
Public Policy Prof Melvyn
Levitsky has different thoughts
on the matter.
"In my opinion, it would be
better if they'd just declared the
whole thing illegal," Levitsky said.
Levitsky pointed out that fed-
eral law and the World Health
Organization consider marijuana
an intoxicating substance, not a
medicine.
"The fact is that federal law
is supreme over state law ... it's
not wise to declare something a
medicine without any scientific
proof."

'Tape' to highlight

motel room, Walgreen
right before Drama Center
Jon's newest
film shows in Free
a Lansing film
festival, Vince has finally gotten
redemption for the years he has
spent in search of the truth ... but,
now what?
Stephen Belber's one-act, no-
intermission play, "Tape," cen-
ters around three characters:
Jon, Vince and Amy, all of whom
are dealing with their pres-
ent while inadvertently being
dragged into the past. As Amy
comes face-to-face with Jon and
Vince, all three must realize a
way to move forward from the
harrowing event.
Elliot Cruz, School of Music,
Theatre & Dance junior and
director of the play, acknowl-
edged that the darker perfor-
mance isn't a typical Basement
Arts production.
"It definitely seems like it
wouldn't be a go-to Basement

show," Cruz said. "But I actu-
ally think that 'Tape' is a per-
fect Basement show, because it's
so short and because it's set in
one location, there's not a lot of
moving around, and so there's a
tightness to it that is really satis-
fying. But it's short enough that
it still resonates."
Constructing the set,
Cruz employed a minimalist
approach. Though the produc-
tion is usually done by recreat-
ing a motel room on stage, Cruz
relied on the actors' perfor-
mance and audience's inference
to create the space.
"(Building) walls for Base-
ment scares me," Cruz admit-
ted. "I'm always worried they're
going to fall over or something.
"So my stage manager,
Tristan, and I went out the other
day and got a sink. We're also
getting a toilet," Cruz contin-
ued. "It's the little things like
that that give you an ides:This is
a bathroom because there's a toi-
let over there. And this is obvi-
ously a motel room, because you
have the two full-sized beds -
these things that really denotea
motel without building an entire
room."
Similar to the uncluttered set,
the story is linear and simple,
relying on the acting to carry it
forward. Belber wrote the script
with the actors in mind, design-
ing it as a play to show their act-
ing prowess rather than moving
the audience with a meaningful
message.
"It is completely actor-driv-
en," Cruz said. "Because of that,
it's super important to know
that this is first and foremost an
actor's play - there's nothing to

distract from it."
To help keep the production
fast-paced, Cruz and the actors
had to dive deep into the motives
of the characters and discover
what it was that made them act
the way they did.
"There are a lot of questions
about these characters and noth-
ing is revealed in the script, so
you have to do a lot of character
work," Cruz explained. "That's
been the biggest challenge for me
as a director and for the actors -
just trying to find reason to stay
on stage when you know (as the
character) you should leave."
Though leaving the audi-
ence with more questions than
answers, Cruz said he hopes the
viewers will be able to appre-
ciate the intense acting and to
place themselves in the shoes. of
the performers, internalizing the
conflicts and deciding what they
would do themselves.
"There are a few moments
that really are meant to shock the
audience, and turn everything
on its ear," Cruz said. "I'm sure
audience members will walk out
wondering, 'What about this,'
'What about that,' but the play-
wright said, 'If there is a reason
for ambiguity, it's to turn the
question the audience is asking
on themselves.'"
"Tape" opens on Valentine's
Day, hoping to draw theater-
lovebirds together through the
art of performance.
"I want them to walk away
with an experience of enjoy-
ment, or a great piece of theater,"
Cruz said. "But it's very much
a play where you walk away
thinking, 'That was interesting.
I wonder ... I just wonder."'

The exciting, controlled
reality of feeling fear

I still remember sitting on my
living room couch and watch-
ing this scene from the HBO
show, "Game of Thrones": Old
Nan, wearing a woven hat, mit-
tens and several layers of warm
clothing, sits with her back to
the fireplace. Knitting hast-
ily, Old Nan speaks to the young
lord, Bran: "Oh, my sweet sum-
mer child. What do you know

when the snows fall a hundred
feet deep and the ice wind comes

WO MEN'S BASKETBAL
Kim Barnes rico,
breaker of streaks

Still in cradle, lacrosse
builds winning formula

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The last time the Michigan
women's basketball team played
Michigan State, Feb. 4, the Wol-
verines struggled, posting their
second-lowest shooting percent-
age from the field at 32.1 percent.
While the men's basketball
team has won three out of its last
five games against the Spartans,
the women's team cannot claim
such success. In fact, the Wol-
verines (7-4 Big Ten, 18-6 over-
all) haven't won in EastLansing
since Jan. 25, 2001 and haven't
won at home against the Michi-
gan State since Jan. 13, 2008.
After falling 61-46 earlier this
month, it was no surprise that a
handful of postgame press con-
ference questions circled around
the lopsided rivarycthat has per-
sisted over the past decade in
favor of the Spartans.
"Michigan State is a program
that sets the bar, obviously, in
the state of Michigan," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "They have a great fan
base, a great following, a great
program, a rich tradition and
they win."
The loss, which pushed Mich-
igan's then-season-high losing
streak to three games, revealed
a lot about the Wolverines.
For one, it showed the pres-
sure and understanding sur-
rounding the rivalry to Barnes
Arico.
"(Michigan State) is clearly
the program that I look at and a
program that's done a tremen-

Young Wolverines
taking lumps now,
but youth creates
strong foundation
By DERICK HUTCHINSON
For The Daily
In just its second year as a
varsity program, the Michigan
lacrosse team started the regular
season with an 11-6 loss at home
to No.15 Penn State on Saturday.
The Wolverines (0"1) lost to the
Nittany Lions (1-0) for the second
straight year, but there's no panic
in the Michigan locker room. For
a team that won just one game in
its first season, the Wolverines
know that this is just a part of the
progression.
"You have a year when you
have trouble getting close, then
a year when you learn to get it
close, then you start learning how
to win the close ones," said Michi-
gan coach John Paul after the loss
to Penn State.
Paul knows a thing or two
about making a transition. After
coaching Michigan's club lacrosse
team for14 years, Paulis in charge
of turning one of the most domi-
nant club teams in the country
into a Division-I contender. On
paper, last year's record might not
have impressed many fans, but
the team did begin to develop the
culture necessary for success in
college athletics.
"If I had to point out one
strength of this team and last
year's team, it's that we never quit
working," Paul said. "I like the
resolve in the locker room, the

energy to replace him right now.
Mitch had some bad turnovers
but he'll improve on it."
" Perhaps most concerning for
Michigan, though, is that McGary
wasn't the only big man with a
rough game Tuesday night. It
wasn't just him; nobody else was
ready either.
As a unit, the Wolverines took
a pounding from the Spartan for-
wards and centers, routinely get-
ting out-muscled and out-worked
in the post.
At the end of the first half,
Michigan State had a 38-24 lead
and had outscored Michigan,
24-8, in the paint. The Spartan
frontcourt had scored 24 points
and missed only three shots,
while the Wolverine big men
had scored just seven. The game
was basically over at that point
- Michigan's deficit continued to
grow as its forwards and centers
continued to get outplayed.
By the end of the game, Michi-
gan State's frontcourt scored 28
points, compared to eight for the
Wolverines. The two backup cen-
ters, Horford and Morgan, com-
bined for only one point off the
bench.
The matchup of the night was

guys were upset (after the loss),
but there was a lot of talk about
getting back to work the next
day."
The players were frustrated
after their loss to Penn State,
but they remain hungry to prove
themselves against top-notch
opponents.
"With the program Michigan
is trying to build, you want to
play the best," said senior cap-
tain Thomas Paras on Saturday.
"We're not shying away from
anyone; it's only going to make us
better."
Paras noted that with quality
opponents like Penn State, Loyola
(Md.), Ohio State and Denver on
the schedule in just its second
year, Michigan is already on the
right track.
Despite the inconsistencies
Saturday, Michigan showed signs
of the team that Paras and Paul
are expecting in the future. It
held Penn State to one goal in both
the first and fourth quarters and
ripped off three straight goals of
its own near the end of the game.
Michigan's coach, however, is not
settling for moral victories.
"I hate even saying, 'We kept it
close,' "Paul said. "It doesn't mat-
ter, you could lose by 20 or one,
you still lost. We have to learn to
finish games out - that's the first
step."
One of the reasons for the early
inconsistency could be the abun-
dance of youth. Freshmen and
sophomores make up more than
60 percent of the roster.
On the other hand, the youth is
also cause for excitement around
the program going forward.
Freshman midfielder Kyle Jack-
son burst onto the scene in his

debut Saturday with two goals
and an assist on Penn State's Aus-
tin Kaut - one of the top goalies
in the country. Jackson is one of
the reasons Paul hasn't lost hope
in an offense that struggled to
score in the season opener.
"Kyle is always going to make
things happen," Paul said. "He's
so good and so confident that he's
going to create opportunities for.
us."
Freshman goalie Gerald
Logan has also impressed his
coaches and teammates. Aside
from his performance on the
field - like his 19-save per-
formance against Penn State
- teammates also say he has a
great work ethic that is common
to the rest of his class.
"Gerry is always trying to get
shot on during the middle of
the day, calling us during class
to see if we want to go shoot on
him," Paras said. "Not only are
(the freshmen) really talented
players, but they are some of the
hardest workers on the team."
Added Paras: "He has poten-
tial to be one of the greatest
goalies in the country in a few
years."
Logan's work ethic and natu-
ral ability have won over team-
mates, coaches and fans around
the Michigan program.
Michigan's next test will be
on Feb. 16 at Bellarmine. Playing
with such a young team on the
road might seem like a difficult
task, but Paul isn't worried.
"With a young team, in some
ways it's easier," Paul said.
"There really are no distrac-
tions. Not having gone on the
road in this way, it's a huge deal
for them. They'll be focused."

Beorenson: clean up forecheck


Freshman forward Mitch McGary couldn't match the Spartans in the paint.

Nix vs: whoever was trying to
guard him. He finished the night
with 14 points and didn't miss a
shot until just under two minutes
in the first half. His game wasn't
flashy either - Nix is listed at 270
pounds and used every ounce of
it to get positioning in the post
against his Michigan counter-
part. He made hook shots, fin-
ished on spin moves and made a
tip in off what looked like a vol-
leyball tip.
"He's a bigbody," Morgan said.
"He just has a way of getting him-
self deep in the paint, you can't let
him get deep in the paint because
he's got a good touch around the
rim."
It's hard to blame Morgan,
because even though he said after
the game that he felt good enough
to play, without restrictions,
Beilein disagreed and said his big

man wasn't 100 percent.
It's hard to blame McGary,
because the Breslin Center is as
tough as an arena there is to play
in the country, especially against
a very talented Spartan front-
court.
It's hard to blame anyone, and
maybe that was the biggest prob-
lem. If a whole unit falters, is it
fair to blame each individual cog?
After the game, Morgan
slumped against a wall, his 6-foot-
8 frame shrinking into the con-
crete below him. He was visibly
frustrated and upset, almost in
disbelief of what had just trans-
pired in East Lansing.
Looking down at the ground,
he shook his head and muttered
what could be the answer.
"I don't think we were pre-
pared for what they brought
tonight."

But against Notre Dame, the
Wolverines looked more relaxed,
waiting in their own zone for the
potent offense to attack.

apart this weekend (against
Notre Dame)," said senior for-
ward A.J. Treais. "We've been
trying out new systems ... but we
tried a new forecheck against
Lake (Superior) State, and ever
since then it's been hit or miss."
So, who is left to take charge
and lead the forecheck to get a
head start on the chores?
Certainly, the older, more
experienced forwards can take
charge and use their physicality
to help outtheir defense.
But the forecheck is one of
mahy interrelated parts that
depend on simple playsBerenson
says, like timing passes.
"A little bit of (making plays)
is experience," Berenson said..
"Some of it is just hoping, you're
hoping and you're taking too
many chances. Then, the other
part is you're playing from
behind. When you start playing
from behind you take chances."
Now, the bye week allows the
Wolverines to focus on the chore
of forechecking stronger. It will
help the forecheck when Michi-
gan takes on Ohio State - the
45th-ranked team nationally in
goals scored - next weekend.
Unless the forecheck
improves, the Wolverines will
have an even longer list of chores
in their remaining weeks.

The Michigan men's basketball team suffered its worse loss since 2007 in a 23-point loss to Michigan State on Tuesday. The Wolverines never led, never had a chance and for the night there was no dispute: the state belonged to the Spar

Spartan muscle

bigs in the paint
ByEVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
EAST LANSING - The Bres-
lin Center was wrapped in white,
Spartan after Spartan filling
every one of the steep seats that

fill the home of the Michigan
State basketball team.
The student section, dubbed
the Izzone, filled up the entire
lower bowl of the arena, a sea of
howling fans that were on their
feet and screaming more than
an hour before the game started.
And before the tip, they put their
arms over the shoulders of their
brethren and rocked back and
forth, creating a rocking, shaking,
sea of white.

Even with earplugs, the noise
levels were incredible - quite a
setting for the first start of fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary's
career.
It had been coming for a couple
weeks now, McGary outgrow-
ing his role as the first Wolverine
off the bench. He was the spark
and the sixth man, a fan favorite,
known for pumping up the stu-
dent section as much as his actual
play on the court.

Even when the usual starting
center, redshirt junior Jordan
Morgan, injured his ankle in late
January, McGary continued to
play the role of the sixth man.
Michigan coach John Beilein
said he liked having the energetic
freshman come off the bench,
even if he ended up with more
minutes than the Wolverine
starting in place of Morgan, red-
shirt sophomore Jon Horford.
Yet, on the road against a

Michigan State frontcourt that
averages almost 30 combined
points per game, Beilein couldn't
wait for the spark of energy off
the bench. He needed it on the
court from the beginning.-
But McGary, like the rest of the
fourth-ranked Wolverines, didn't
look or play the part. Before Mor-
gan subbed in four minutes into
the game, McGary had missed a
jumper, gotten beat in the paint
for a basket by Spartan center

Derrick Nix and turned the ball
over on a bad pass out of the post
that led to a Michigan State bas-
ket intransition.
The stage was set for McGary's
first big starting performance.
He wasn't ready, and neither was
Michigan in a 75-52 loss on Tues-
day night.
"He's still learning, and he's
thrown in there and has to learn,"
Beilein said. "With Jordan's inju-

What's wrong with
students today?
with Engineering Prof. Elliot Soloway and
LSA Prof. Bruce Conforth

LSA Prof Bruce Conforth and
Engineering Prof Elliot Soloway met
at The Michigan Daily newsroom to
discuss this question. This is the first
in a series of bi-weekly features entitled
"Conversations,"bringing together two
unique individuals - often occupying
different campus spheres - to engage
in dialogue.
Prof. Bruce Conforth: I com-
pletely reject the question, on at least
a two grounds. First of all, it's start-
ing with the assumption that there's
something wrong with students. And
secondly, it's based on a comparison.
What's wrong with students com-
pared to what? So I think it's a faulty
question.
Prof. Elliot Soloway: I've seen
kids ten years ago. You've been here
for a while, right?
BC: Eleven years.
ES: Eleven years, I've been here
twenty. And some of the kids ten years
ago, I think were more risk-taking, at
least in the Engineering context. So I
agree that it's a weird question. But I
just feel that the kids today aren't tak-
ing the risks that they did ten years
ago. And I don't know why, butI had
the good fortune of having Larry
Page (Google co-founder) as a student
and Tony Fadell. He did the iPod; he
invented the iPod - not Steve Jobs.
And these kids and their peers, they
were pretty much risk-takers in terms
of building things, trying things and I
don't see that anymore.
BC: But is that the student's fault?
And that's why I raised my objec-
tion to the question at the beginning,
because I could say I see the same
thing... but we have to ask, if students
today are less risk takers, why are they
less risk-takers?Is itsomething inher-
ent in the students, or has something
changed in culture that has contribut-
ed to them becoming less risk-takers?
ES: I think maybe it's the culture,
as in these kids today are the result
of "No Child Left Behind." These are
the kids that went through that kind
of education that, in my mind, is very
drilled and memorized, and it's very
memorized and "keep the content" as
opposed to "invent."
ES: But we gotta do something. I
feel like I oweit to them. This is the
University of Michigan and for bet-
ter or worse, it is an elite place. This is

one of the special places ... so if we're
not going to produce the kids that are
going to be the next risk takers, the
next Larry Pages, then who is? And
I don't know how to make them do it.
BC: Well, I don't know if you can
make anyone do anything, but I
totally agree with you. And that is our
responsibility. I think teaching is a
sacred undertaking, and if you're not
going to walk into the classroom and
try and make that happen with your
students, then you probably shouldn't
be teaching in the first place.
ES: That's an amazing statement.
It's a sacred undertaking?
BC: I think so. How far into the
future will your influence go? How
much of a change in the world can you
make? If you just reach one of your
students in the entire history of your
teaching and my teaching, we could
reach one student that literally chang-
es the world.
BC: I think that you can teach any
subject in a way that it relates directly
to the student ... If you're not making
your classes about the students -
regardless of what you're teaching -
then you're failing as a teacher.
ES: It's all about them. It is about
them. It's right ... I mean, the stuff is
the stuff.
BC: That's the perfect way of put-
ting it. The stuff is the stuff, but the
class is ultimately about them, what
are they going to do with this.
ES: But we're more comfortable,
most ofus (teachers), with the stuff.
BC: Because the other part is tak-
ing a risk. And there yougo back to the
original statement. You said the stu-
dents aren't risk-takers, maybe we, as
teachers, need to be more risk-takers.
ES.That's good. That's good.We're
playing it safe, that's really right.
We're, teaching stuff and we're not
teaching aboutithem. It's a risk, you're
putting yourself out in a funny way.
And you don't want to do that, it's too
much of a risk. You're right, we're not
modeling risk-taking In the research
world, I feel like I'm modeling it more,
because I'll fail. But in the classroom
maybe we're not taking risks ... You
have to fail, or else you're not taking
enough of a risk.You can't be success-
ful all the time. Nobody's successful
all the time.

taunting me as if to say, "Look

I was flattered enough to stick
around.
Our relationship endured, and
the summer after sophomore
year I found myself living in Ann
Arbor completely alone for the
first time in my life. My room-
mate left for her summer job as
a camp counselor in northern
Michigan, and our apartment for
two suddenly dwindled into an
apartment for one.
I decided to take the extra alone
time to get to know Ann Arbor
a bit more intimately - since we
had made it this far, after all. I
went on bike rides through the
suburbs, spent hours thumbing
through novels at Dawn Treader
and traversed the Ann Arbor
Farmers Market in search of the
perfect tomato. Sometimes I ana-
lyzed art for entire afternoons at
UMMA and then licked frosting
off my fingers at The Cupcake
Station after hiking in the Arb.
Could it be that I was developing
feelings?
One day in June, exhausted
after cramming for an economics
final, I walked out into the Law
Quad and sat on that bench. A
smile started to stretch across my
face as I realized this town had
won my heart. It had given me so
many things to love. And, for the
first time, I loved it back.

Her French is abysmal, and
she hasn't fully grasped what she
is doing there - all she knows is
somewhere, hidden among -the
pastel-colored macaroons and the
Arc de Triomphe, there's some-
thing she has yet to find.
Sitting upon a park bench on
the last day of her trip, the after-
noon sun dancing whimsically
across her face, she finally finds it.
Her eyes begin to well with tears
as she stares dreamily across the
Parisian skyline, overcome with
the realization that she is experi-
encing true love for the first time.
This particular scene resonates
for me because I've been there.
Not to Paris - to a similar look-
ing bench in the Law Quad, upon
which I too felt the unexpected
warmth of adoration washing
over me. This wasn't the roman-
tic type of love - with its inter-
twined hands, sweet nothings and
coquettish grins - but the deep
affection for a place, a landscape.
However, my relationship with
Ann Arbor wasn't love at first

great loves; it took time.

Dissatisfied and disheartened,
I began searching for other pros-
pects, scouring the Internet for a
better match, allured by the effer-
vescent sunshine of University of
California, Berkeley, the comfort
and ease of Ohio State University.
Never mind what their transfer
rates. were, I was hell-bent on
finding my academic soul mate.
I returned to Ann Arbor in
January and reluctantly agreed
to let the city drag me on a sec-
ond date. The second shot wasn't
much better than the first, but
this time I felt the faint glim-
mer of belonging - of an insti-
tution dedicated to reinstating
my diminished sense of purpose
and drive. I slowly started to feel
inspired again. I started writing.
I made friends. Ann Arbor hadn't
knocked me head-over-heels, but

f you asked my roommates what's the
hardest part about living with me, they
would probably say it's the fact that I
listen to talk radio while I sleep. Apparently
when the headphones fall out of my ears, it's
super annoying to hear Carl Kasell's voice at
two in the morning. I wouldn't know; I love
him.
. I don't listen to just any talk radio; this is
NPR. National Public Radio. 88.5 FM is the
station in my hometown. Characterized by
economic, political and cultural programs
with jazz interludes and possibly (read: prob-
ably) the same voices from 40 years ago. I
fall into three of the four characteristics for
their demographic: early 50s, white, middle
income with a liberal bias. And of course
there's the annual pledge drive, which, to me,
is the sound of my childhood.
I have been listeningto NPR since I was six
years old. My mom would drive my brother
and me to Freemont, Calif. for our respective
guitar and dance lessons. The soundtrack for
the two-hour round trip was "Wait Wait...
Don't Tell Me," where I learned about all the
different ways a criminal could steal sau-
sages by stuffing-them into their pants. And
on the way back, "This American Life" with

Ira Glass's breathy monologues and amazing
stories of the strange, the mundane and the
almost impossible. And if we were lucky, and
traffic was a little slow on the way back, we
would catch the beginning of "Car Talk." On
other nights, I remember staying up late with
my family listening to the annual "Pretty
Good Joke Show" and laughing at jokes I was
too young to really understand.
And I haven't even gotten to "A Prairie
Home Companion," - which to this day I
still don't understand all the time, but that
doesn't stop me from listening. The sto-
ries of Garrison Keillor (Private I) in Lake
Wobegon makes me feel like I'm sitting
near a crackling fire after having heard one
of President Franklin Roosevelt's fireside
chats. After TV came along, radio was just
music, news and sports. But on NPR, they're
keeping the vintage style of radio alive, play-
ing radio shows with episodes and characters
and story lines, even though it's possible I'm
the only one who's listening.
Honestly, I'm not even sure when my fas-
cination with NPR became a necessity; all I
know is now I can't sleep unless "Wait Wait...
Don't Tell Me" is playing. When my 'mind
won't turn off and all I want to do is calm

down but instead I'm freaking out about an
orgo exam, Peter Sagal is the only man I want
in my bed. And when I don't want to leave the
house because it's snowing and two degrees,
the only thing that can distract me from the
cold are the stories by Mike Birbiglia and
David Sedaris. This summer, when the only
song on the radio was Goyte's "Somebody
That I Used To Know," I filled my ears with
"Morning Edition." Part of my packing rou-
tine for my frequent flights home is to upload
my iPod with the most recent "Freakonom-
ics" episodes - otherwise the six-hour flight
feels like 20.And if I'm too lazy to uploadnew
episodes, I'll listen to the same ones until I've
memorized the 40-minute show.
My friends tease me about it. My room-
mates don't understand. I was once morti-
fied in front of a sophomore history class for
having more in common with my 70-year-old
teacher than my classmates. I used my love of
NPR in a college essay; it's a great source for
dinner conversation and English assignments
and even better for drowning out my dad's
snoring on family vacations.
I may be obsessed - addicted even. The
medical definition of addiction reads: "A com-
pulsive need for and use of a habit-forming

substance." Compulsive sounds like the right
word to me. Neurotic, irresistible, habit-form-
ing. The more I listen, the more I want new
episodes of the shows and when there isn't,
I settle for bottom of the barrel: NPR's "All
Things Considered."
I try pretty hard to keep my addiction hid-
den in my headphones. Experience has taught
me that drunk people get pretty brutal if you
plug your iPod into the party speakers and
instead of "Call Me Maybe" you accidentally
get Glass's slightly creepy voice blaring out of
the speakers.
So yes, NPR could be my crutch. When-
ever life's hard or too overwhelming I know
I can escape into the dulcet tones of Kai
Risdall. I block out the world by listening to
experts discuss the biggest and most wide-
spread issues. To most people this would
probably make them more anxious. But my
problems seem so small and silly in compari-
son, and that's a relief. No matter how awful
my test went or how shitty someone treated
me, we're all screwed in the longrun anyway
- including that asshole who cut me off this
morning.

6 Wednesday, February 13, 2013 The Statement
Beyond the classroom, into the community
by Melanie Kruvelis

SA senior Emily Rheaume heard
about Project Outreach at just the
right time.
"I was a sophomore - I didn't know what
the hell I was doing," she said. "But I ended up
taking the class that shaped my future."
Rheaume, now a senior in the Interna-
tional Studies Program, hopes to study public
health after she graduates this May, focusing
on maternal and child health. Rheaume said
after taking Project Outreach, a psychology
course that combines lecture with commu-
nity service, she realized what she wanted to
do post-undergrad - and possibly, the rest of
her life.
"When a friend told me about Project Out-
reach, I still wasn't sure what I was doing
here," Rheaume said. "But I could tell that
class sounded different."
In Project Outreach, students split in-class
hours with fieldwork around the Ann Arbor
area. From spending time in juvenile deten-
tion centers to working with ESL preschool-
ers, students break out of the lecture hall and
dive right into the community, giving them a
whole new classroom experience.
Rheume, who was placed in the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System's childcare
center, said working with three to five year
olds - especially those from international
. families - put her developmental psychology
knowledge to the test.
"There's only so much you can learn in the
classroom," Rheaume said. "Some of the most
important lessons I learned happened right
out there - out in the community."
REACHING OUT
Project Outreach - or Psychology 211, as
it's listed in the course guide - is one of more
than 60 service-learning classes taught at
the University. LSA Prof. Ian Robinson, the
faculty sponsor for the Sociology Depart-
ment's Project Community course, says these
courses are, to some extent, an offshoot of the
famed campus activism of the 1960s.

"In the mid-60s, a lot of students were
heading down south to engage in the civil
rights movement," Robinson said. "When
they came back to Michigan, they wanted to
continue what had been a transformative part
of their lives."
Many of these students pushed for inde-
pendent studies, hoping to find a way to inte-
grate activism into their class schedule. In
1975, Prof. Emeritus Mark Chesler, one of the
University's leading experts on social justice,
founded Project Community, a course that
bridges the gap between academia and the
ever-elusive "real world." Today, with four
areas of interest and more than 150 students
enrolled each semester, not to mention 20 to
30 Peer Facilitators, Project Community has
grown into one of the largestservice-oriented
courses at the University.
Just like the other service-learning class-
es taught on campus, Project Community is
overseen by the Ginsberg Center, a branch
of the University's division of student affairs.
The center, which focuses on expanding com-
munity service-learning on campus, supports
some 3,000 students each year through its
courses. Dave Waterhouse, the director of
student initiatives at the Ginsberg Center,
says that number is much higher when you
account for the support the center gives to
student organizations across campus.
"It's hard to estimate just how many stu-
dents we reach each year," Waterhouse said.
"But we do know that by the time they gradu-
ate, more than 80 percent of Michigan stu-
dents have had a significant service-learning
experience."
Stacked against national averages, these
statistics are impressive. In 2010, about 26
percent of college students in the United
States volunteered in some capacity. Still,
Robinson has noticed a"slight drop in stu-
dent interest in community service, which he
chalks up to growing economic pressures.
"Students today are more strapped for
time," Robinson said. "You've got kids taking
on part-time jobs, which have gone from 10

hours to 20 hours a week. When you're bal-
ancing rising tuition cost, it can be hard to
find the time to volunteer."
Rheaume agreed.
"From the 4 required on-site hours a week,
to the lectures, to the discussion, not to men-
tion the assignments - these classes can be a
lot of work."
"Since they're out of the classroom, a lot
of people sign up for these classes thinking
they'll be easy," Robinson added. "But the fact
is, students might be putting more time into
this class than any other at the University."
And when it comes to actually going out
to these communities, students and faculty
alike realize these classes aren't exactly a
cakewalk.
"It's a challenge, you know - going out
into a community where you don't under-
stand someone, and they don't understand
you," said Carole Lapidos, program director
for "It's Great to Be a Girl," a female-oriented
mentorship class that pairs Michigan under-
grads - or Femtors - with middle school
students. "But we really work on preparing
our- Femtors for their experience, because
more often than not, it's a lot more difficult
than they imagine."
Gearing students up for community
engagement isn't as simple as preparing
them for an exam, Waterhouse said. Accord-
ing to Waterhouse, the Ginsberg Center
spends a lot of time with students, training
them for whatever they might face in their
community service.
"We're not here to go in and save any-
body," Waterhouse said. "Our students get
as much out of these experience as anyone
else, and it's important they understand the
ins and outs of the community they're about
to enter."
Lapidos echoed Waterhouse's sentiments.
"IGTBAG doesn't focus on reaching one par-
ticular population. We encourage our Fem-
tors to focus on what they wished they heard
in middle school - not just the differences
they see in each community."

MOVING FORWARD
Though the University currently has no
plans to make volunteer service a require-
ment to graduate, Waterhouse says service-
learning experiences will be a priority for
administrators going forward.
"Classes with communwity service com-
ponents are a particular emphasis under
the Third Century Initiative," Waterhouse
said. The initiative, a five-year, $50-million
investment in action-based learning, was
introduced by University President Mary
Sue Coleman in 2011. Focusing on entre-
preneurship, study abroad expansion and
service-learning, Waterhouse says renewed
administrative interest in community service
will help expand the reach of the Ginsberg
Center.
"Interest in our programs is growing,"
Waterhouse said. "Students and faculty are
seeingtangible results from our services."
Some students want to see more of a
commitment to community service from
the University by adding it as a require-
ment to graduation similar to LSA's distri-
bution requirement. Today, the Psychology
Department is the only department that
requires community service in order to
graduate.
"The University should absolutely
require community service," Rheaume
said. "You can't just be an academic when
you come here."
Rheaume paused. "A lecture hall isn't
enough," she said. "You need to go out and
get your hands dirty."
Robinson cautioned of the challenges
that-surround organizing these classes as a
requirement.
"Setting up the programs is a huge time
(commitment)," Robinson said, mention-
ing the difficulties in coordinating not only
with students, GSIs and peer facilitators,
but also community organizations. "These
classes pay off in the long run. But they
don't come without a serious investment."

"Football coaches tend to be a little bit
paranoid and controlling, and that s just the
culture of the sport," Rosenberg said. "It's
almost a militaristic kind of structure."
He noted that the NHL, NBA and MBL
are often more open to media interactions
since they tend to have a looser, less rigid
culture.
But because Michigan athletics have such
a formidable fan base, administrators don't
feel pressured to generate as much publicity
or be open with the media.
"There's nothing wrong with the program

efit from it because they're selling the place

For Rosenberg, building relationships
with coaches and athletic departments is
key to developing a quality toolkit of sourc-
es.
"I think you. should build relationships
and build trust over time," Rosenberg said.
"You can't go over there and expect to
have a bunch of great sources giving you
stuff in a month, or even a year. You just
have tobe patient and get to know people."
With that relationship, journalists,
spokespeople and administrators gain a
respect for each other's motivations, he said.
For cadres of journalists, it's an intricate
understanding that each party has its pri-
orities, and if that means a reporter asking
a tough question, that's just part of the job.
"They're just different people in different
roles," Rosenberg said.
