Protest voices staff qualms

Students march with
staff across campus
against shared services
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Through bitter winds and the frigid
snowfall,echoes of"chop fromthe top"
and "noAST cuts"resonated across the
Diag.
Marching from Rackham Audito-
rium to the Fleming Administration
Building, almost 5o students, faculty
and staff gathered Monday to deliver
a letter to Rowan Miranda, associate
vice president for finance. Miranda is
one of the administrators involved in
the implementation of the proposed
Shared Services Center -but has come
under fire because of his previous rela-

tionship with the consulting firm that
designed the initiative.
The center, a component of the
Administrative Services Transforma-
tion project, would consolidate some
University departmental staff mem-
bers into a central location on State
Street near the University's Wolverine
Tower, creating an estimated savings
of $5 to $6 million per year. The tran-
sition would move almost 300 cleri-
cal employees to the new location and
would require that they re-interview
for their new positions.
While University administrators
announced that they will delay the
transition due to a slew of faculty con-
cerns and a 1200-signiture strong peti-
tion, the group assembled Monday to
demand a full rollback of the AST ini-
tiative.
Rackham student Brian Whitener,
a member of the Student Union of

Michigan, said the letter delivered to
Miranda includes a job application for
him to fill out to be evaluated by the
group of protesters. The gesture comes
after staff members affected by the
Shared Services Center were required
to re-interview for their jobs with the
University.
Along with the Student Union of
Michigan, members of the Graduate
Employee's Organization and Lectur-
ers' Employee Organization also par-
ticipated in the march.
Whitener said the mixed group
of student and faculty participants
reflect the importance of halting the
AST initiative by demonstrating how
it negatively affects the majority of the
campus population.
"We think that the University should
be run in a different way and it should
be run with the priorities of students,

Senate Assembly
discusses concerns over
faculty involvement in
staffing decisions
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily Staff Reporter
The last meeting for the Senate
Assembly's calendar year brought
about 60 faculty members to Palm-
er Commons Monday afternoon.
Ultimately, the group decided to
endorse two resolutions related to the
Administrative Services Transfor-
mation initiative that the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University Affairs
drafted at their meeting last week.
To start off the meeting, SACUA
chair Karen Staller provided a time-
line for the University's actions lead-
ing up to the AST, beginning with the
use of Hackett consulting company in
2009. Hackett conducted a survey and
analyzed data before suggesting the
AST and IT Rationalization as poten-
tial cost management strategies by
consolidating staff positions found to
be redundant.
Discussing AST, Staller acknowl-
edged that the University is experienc-
ing "tough times of belt tightening"

EMPLOYEE UPROAR
LSA faculty, staff

and that the painless parts of budget
cuts, or "low-hanging fruit" like con-
solidating information technology,
have already been implemented. She
added that even after the administra-
tion officially postponed any AST-
related action until April of next year,
the faculty still has concerns about
the program's transparency and who
makes the final decisions.
"Last week the provost told the
deans of all the schools to talk with
their faculty (about AST), and we
had our meeting in Social Work on
Wednesday," she said.
This comes after department heads
were originally told not to discuss
changes with affected staff mem-
bers-characterized by some as a gag
order-which caused rumors and fears
to grow about the AST initiative.
The first resolution addressed the
AST process, criticizing the use of an
outside consulting firm - Accenture
LLP - and claimed there was not
"a meaningful participation of and
evaluation by the faculty, resulting in
inadequate considerationofthe conse-
quences and effects of this program."
The Senate Assembly endorsed the
"suspension of the implementation
of AST until its impact on the educa-
tional and teaching missions of the
University can be fully considered and

RESEARCH
Study: Even
normal noise
exposure can
be dangerous
Researchers linkloudness
to highblood pressure
and heartproblems
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily Staff Reporter
Does danger lurk in your iPod?
Thursday, Public Health Assistant
Prof. Richard Neitzel and a team at the
School of Public Health published find-
ings related to the dangers of prolonged
exposure to noise. Neitzel said noise is
often overlooked as a potential health
hazard, both in occupational settings
and daily life. While people often asso-
ciate loud noises with hearing loss,
prolonged exposure to even moderate
noise levels may have other serious
health consequences, including high
blood pressure and heart attack.
Following his research appearing
in the journal Environmental Health
Perspectives, Neitzel said he hopes the
paper will reenergize the conversation
about noise as a health hazard - a topic
that has seen little research over the
last several decades.
"(Noise) is something almost no one
thinks about, compared to something
like air pollution," Neitzel said. "In a
way, it's like the wild west of exposures
in that we tolerate it being there and
haven't looked into it much, really since
the 1970s."
Neitzel conducted the first portion
of his research in New York City, where
he studied environmental factors that
contribute to hearing loss. Surpris-

ingly, he found that most people were
"driving their own exposure" through

Faculty debate AST at
special meeting called
by interim dean
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News ditor
In a special forum called by interim
LSA Dean Susan Gelman at last week's
regularly scheduled faculty meeting.
About 250 LSA professors and faculty
members met in Rackham Auditorium
Monday evening to debate the contro-
versial Administration Services Trans-
formation project - which would
consolidate some University staff in a
central location and save the Univer-
sity an estimated $5 to $6 million per
year.
The group of faculty passed a
motion that calls for AST to be delayed
for two years. Its implementation
would then be reevaluated pending "a
more thorough" examination of alter-
natives, determination of costs and
benefits, and consultation with the
affected schools, colleges, faculty and
staff members.
American Culture Prof. Gregory
Dowd, the chair of the American Cul-
ture Department, brought forth the
motion. He hopes it will open fur-
ther discussion on the consultation
between faculty and top administra-
tors, negating any consequences of a,
rushed implementation. Additionally,
faculty members hope to increase the
transparency of the decision-making
process between administrators and
the rest of the campus community, a
common complaint of the administra-

tion's handling of the project thus far.
A copy of the resolution will be sent
to University President Mary Sue Cole-
man; University Provost Martha Pol-
lack; E. Royster Harper, vice president
for student life; and Timothy Slottow,
executive vice president and chief
financial officer.
AST was developed through an
$11.7 million contract with Accen-
ture, a major consulting firm, signed
earlier this year. Since the University
announced the plan, it has garnered
criticism from diverse campus constit-
uencies. Almost 1,200 faculty members
have signed a petition against the tran-
sition, and multiple departments have
sent letters directly to top administra-
tors.
. Earlier Monday, about 50 students,
faculty and staff delivered a letter to
Rowan Miranda, associate vice presi-
dent of finance and one of the leaders
in implementing the proposed Shared
Services Center initiative, demanding
that Miranda should resign and reap-
ply for his position. Miranda previ-
ously worked for Accenture's higher
education practice - which some have
viewed asa conflict of interest with his
current position.
University administrators
announced last week that they will
delay the transition to the Shared Ser-
vices Center until after April and con-
tinue to reevaluate the extent of the
initiative in the wake of faculty outcry.
Astronomy Prof. Sally Oey, a mem-
ber of the Senate Assembly Committee
on University Affairs, brought forth
an amendment clarifying that the
implementation would be reevaluated

Young adults will have
big impact on future of

By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily Staff Reporter
Come Jan. 1, many Americans will
receive health insurance - some
for the first time - under the provi-
sions of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, also known as
Obamacare. However, as the Dec. 23
enrollment deadline for health cover-
age in 2014 approaches, questions and

uncertainty abound, both at the, Uni-
versity and around the nation.
Of particular concern for health-
care providers are reimbursement
rates - the amount of money a hos-
pital receives from insurance compa-
nies for providing care - which will
likely change as individuals enroll in
or switch insurance plans.
In preparation for these impend-
ing financial adjustments, the Uni-
versity of Miphigan Health System
has been performing extensive sen-
sitivity analyses, which allow admin-
istrators to estimate potential shifts
in coverage within the population it

Florida congressman loses Filner, ex-mayor of San
in large investment scheme Diego, given sentence

Rep. Alan Grayson
lost $18 million to
Virginia-based
fake investor
McLEAN, Va. (AP) - U.S. Rep.
Alan Grayson of Florida lost $18
million in a scheme that cheated
him and about 120 other inves-
tors out of more than $35 million,
accordingto court papers.
The Virginia man who ran the
scheme, William Dean Chapman,
was sentenced Friday in federal
court to 12 years in prison. Pros-
ecutors say Chapman used the
money to fund a lavish lifestyle
including a Lamborghini, a Fer-
rari and a $3 million home.
In most of the court papers,
Grayson's identity is protected
- prosecutors say only that an
elected official with the initials
A.G. was the primary victim -
but documents twice mention


Grayson by name. The Demo-
cratic congressman on Monday
confirmed he is the A.G. men-
tioned in the documents.
Nothing in the court papers
suggests Grayson was anything
but a victim of the scheme. Gray-
son, a former trial attorney, said
he has had a long record for
picking winning stocks, which
formed the basis for his personal
fortune.
The scheme worked like this:
clients would turn over their
stocks to Chapman as collateral
for a loan, and Chapman would
let customers borrow about 90
percent of the stocks' value.
If the stocks did badly, bor-
rowers could walk away and keep
the money they were loaned. But
if the borrowers' stocks did well,
they would repay the loan with
interest, and Chapman was sup-
posed to return the stocks to the
investor at their increased value.
But, according to court papers,
Chapman sold the stocks and had


-an,,

no way to fulfill his obligations if
a client's stock portfolio did well.
"That's why (Chapman) is
going to prison for a long, long
time," Grayson said. "At least in
the end, some kind of justice was
served."
In Grayson's case, his stocks
performed astronomically well
while they were entrusted to
Chapman and his company,
Alexander Capital Markets.
Lawyers for Chapman said it
was the strength of Grayson's
stocks that caused Chapman's
scheme to crumble. Chapman
and Grayson negotiated a pay-
ment plan, according to court
records, but it was not enough to
keep Chapman's positions from
collapsing.
"Because the return on A.G.'s
commodities investments were
so astronomical, ACM could not
meet its obligations under the
loan agreements," defense law-
yer Whitney Minter wrote.
In 2007, Grayson had $9.35
million in a stock portfolio that
Chapman was supposed to be
holding as collateral. In that
year alone, the portfolio's value
increased by 147 percent, to $23
million, according to a ch:' -in
thl court documents.
Chapman's lawyer did not
immediately return a call. Chap-
man, of Sterling, Va., pleaded
guilty in May buttried at Friday's
sentencing hearing to withdraw
the plea, saying he felt pressured
to plead and that he never intend-
ed to defraud.
It is not the first time
Grayson, who represents parts
of the Orlando area, has lost tens
of millions of dollars in a fraud
scheme. In 2009, he won a $34
million judgment after filing
a lawsuit in South Carolina
under federal racketeering
laws against a company called
Derivium Capital. Derivium's
business plan for hedging an
investor's stock profile was
nearly identical to the plan
outline by Chapman.
Grayson said he first entered
into deals with Chapman in
2003, well before the deal with

Disgraced official
bound to home for
probationary period
SAN DIEGO (AP) - When
he was mayor of San Diego, Bob
Filner waited to be alone with
women to kiss, grope and man-
handle them without any wit-
nesses, accordingto a probation
officer's report released after
he was sentenced Monday to
home confinement.
Filner, 71, apologized and told
the judge he would try to earn
the trust of those he betrayed
and recover his integrity - a
sharp contrast to his defiant
resignation speech nearly four
months ago in which he said he
was the victim of "a lynch mob."
His attorney Jerry Coughlan
said Filner dropped mood-alter-
ing medications when he became
mayor. That, combined with the
stress of leading the nation's
eighth-largest city, substantially
contributed to Filner's behavior,
Coughlan wrote to the judge.
Superior Court Judge Rob-
ert Trentacosta sentenced Fil-
ner to three months of home
confinement and three years of
probation - the same punish-
ment that prosecutors had rec-
ommended in a plea agreement
reached in October.
"I want to apologize to my
family, who have stood by me
through this ordeal, to my loyal
staff and supporters, the citizens
of San Diego and most sincerely
to the women I have hurt and
offended," Filner told the judge
in a brief statement. "Certainly
the behaviors before this court
today will never be repeated."
Filner had faced a maximum
possible penalty of three years in
prison for a felony count of false
imprisonment and one year in
jail for each of two misdemeanor
counts of battery.
The former 10-term con-
gressman cannot seek or hold
elected office while on proba-
tion and will be monitored by

GPS during home confinement,
which begins Jan. 1.
The three victims in the com-
plaint, who were not named,
declined to attend the sentenc-
ing and didn't seek restitu-
tion, according to the probation
report. One said she wished Fil-
ner would be sentenced to three
months in jail and would leave
San Diego, while the others had
no opinion on an appropriate
punishment.
Nearly 20 women have public-
ly identified themselves as targets
of Filner's unwanted advances,
including kissing, groping and
requests for dates. His accus-
ers include a retired Navy rear
admiral, a San Diego State Uni-
versity dean and a great-grand-
mother who volunteers her time
to answer the questions of senior
citizens at City Hall.
Filner, who is twice divorced,
pleaded guilty to the - felony
for what the probation report
described as putting a woman in
a headlock after a dinner party
on March 6 and attempting to
kiss her on the lips. The woman,
identified as a longtime Filner
acquaintance, told authorities
that he kissed her eye and she
elbowed him to get free.
He pleaded guilty to a mis-
demeanor for kissing a woman
on the lips without permission
at a "Meet the Mayor" event on
April 6, according to the proba-
tion report. The woman, who
came to report alleged financial
improprieties, told authorities
the mayor had asked an aide to
leave the curtain-shielded cubi-
cle where they met.
The other misdemeanor
involved grabbing another wom-
an's buttocks at a May 25 rally to
clean up Fiesta Island in Mission
Bay. The probation report says
the woman was posing with the
mayor for a photograph taken by
her mother.
"Clearly, the defendant's
efforts to avoid detection by wit-
nesses suggest he was aware his
behaviors and intended actions
were wrong and most certainly

inappropriate," Charles Ledbet-
ter, a San Diego County senior
probation officer, wrote in his
report.
Filner disappeared from pub-
lic view after leaving office Aug.
30, less than nine months into a
four-year term. His attorney said
Filner has been jogging daily,
attending two counseling ses-
sions a week and relying on fam-
ily for moral support. He said
Filner hoped to write about his
experiences as a 1960s civil rights
activistand member of Congress.
Filner was undergoing psy-
chiatric counseling and tak-
ing medications prescribed by
congressional doctors "to help
stabilize his mood and safe-
guard his mental health," but
he dropped medications after
becoming mayor, Coughlan
wrote to the judge. The attor-
ney didn't elaborate on Filner's
mental health issues in his
memo and didn't immediately
respond to a phone message
seeking further comment.
The charges do not involve
Filner's former communications
director, Irene McCormack Jack-
son, who expedited the mayor's
downfall by becomingth..irstto
go public with sexual harassneit
allegations in July. She sued Fil-
ner and the city, claiming her boss
asked her to work without pant-
ies, demanded kisses and dragged
herin aheadlock.
Gloria Allred, McCormack
Jackson's attorney, told reporters
that Filner was "one lucky man"
for being spared jail time. She
and McCormack Jackson sat in
the front row during sentencing.
Filner was elected San Diego's
first Democratic mayor in 20
years, vowing to put neglect-
ed neighborhoods ahead of
entrenched downtown business
interests. Two city councilmen
seeking to replace him in a spe-
cial election runoff - Republican
Kevin Faulconer and Democrat
David Alvarez - have embraced
Filner's neighborhoods-first
mantra while scarcely mention-
ing the former mayor by name.

doesn't want him charged with
aggravated assault, battery and
criminal mischief.
In the signed affidavit, Samqn-
tha Scheibe - referring to Zim-
merman as "my boyfriend" - said
that detectives misinterpreted
what she said and that she hasn't
been coerced into the request.
Zimmerman was arrested last
month after Scheibe accused him
in a call to 911 of pointing a gun at
her, smashing a coffee table and
pushing her outside. Zimmerman
also called dispatchers, denied

pointing a gun at her and blamed
her for the broken table.

Looting, violence
spread as police
strike continues

THAI SPOKtSMAN OFFICt/AP
Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca takes questions from the media after the FBI released results of a federal probe,
Monday at a news conference in Los Angeles.
Sheriffs formally charged
and accused of corruption

Eighteen deputies
found engaging
in civil abuse and
beating inmates
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Feder-
al officials say 18 current and for-
mer Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputies saw themselves as being
"above the law," engaging in cor-
ruption and civil rights abuses
that included beating inmates
and visitors, falsifying reports,
and trying to block an FBI probe
of the nation's largest jail system.
The charges were announced
at a news conference Monday
after 16 of the 18 defendants were
arrested earlier in the day. At
least two are no longer working
for the department and some of
those charged were scheduled to
appear in U.S. District Court on
Monday.
"These incidents did not take
place in a vacuum - in fact, they
demonstrated behavior that had
become institutionalized. The
pattern of activity alleged in the
obstruction of justice case shows
how some members of the Sher-
iff's Department considered
themselves to be above the law,"
U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr.
said.
Sheriff Lee Baca said at a sepa-
rate news conference that he
was troubled by the charges and

called it a sad day for his depart-
ment.
"Please know that I respect the
criminal justice system and no
one is above the law," Baca said.
He said the department will
continue to cooperate with the
FBI and that the arrested depu-
ties who are still employed by
the department will be relieved
of duty and their pay suspended.
He also defended the depart-
ment, pointing to reforms since
allegations surfaced in 2011, and
said the problem wasn't an insti-
tutional one.
Four grand jury indictments
and a criminal complaint include
accusations that deputies plot-
ted to impede the FBI by mov-
ing an informant in the jails and
attempting to intimidate a lead
FBI agent outside her house; that
deputies unlawfully detained
and used force on visitors to
Men's Central Jail, included
detaining and handcuffing the
Austrian consul general in one
example, and in another, grab-
bing a man by the neck, forcing
his head into a refrigerator, then
throwing him to the floor and
pepper spraying his eyes; and
that deputies falsified reports to
make arrests seem lawful or in.
another case, struck, kicked and
pepper sprayed an inmate and
made false reports to have the
inmate charged with and pros-
ecuted for assaulting deputies.
The FBI has been investigat-

ing allegations of excessive force
and other misconduct at the
county's jails since at least 2011.
Among those charged with
conspiracy and obstruction of
justice are two lieutenants, one
of whom oversaw the depart-
ment's safe jails program and
another who investigated alle-
gations of local crimes commit-
ted by sheriff's personnel, two
sergeants and three deputies.
All seven are accused of trying
to prevent the FBI from contact-
ing or interviewing an inmate
who was helping federal agents
in a corruption and civil rights
probe. One of the investigations
involved trying to see if a deputy
would accept a bribe to provide
the inmate with a cellphone,
court documents show.
The indictment alleges the
inmate was moved to hide him
and false entries were made in
the sheriff's databases to make it
appear as if he had been released.
In an attempt to find out more
information about the investiga-
tion, one lieutenant and the two
sergeants sought a court order to
compel the FBI to provide docu-
ments, prosecutors said. When a
state judge denied the proposed
order, the two.sergeants alleg-
edly attempted to intimidate
one of the lead FBI agents out-
side her house and falsely told
her they were going to seek
a warrant for her arrest, the
indictment said.

Argentina in
chaos, five dead
across nation
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) - Outbreaks of looting
have spread across Argentina as
mobs take advantage of strikes
by police demanding pay raises
to match inflation.
Videos show people shatter-
ing glass doors and hauling out
everything from mattresses and
cellphones to baby carriages and
beer.
By Monday night, the death
toll from the chaotic outbursts
climbed to five as officers rallied
outside negotiatingsessions, citi-
zens huddled inside their homes
and businesses, and federal
troops deployed to trouble spots.
The trouble spread to at least
19 of Argentina's 23 provinces,
and most commerce shut down
in many cities just ahead of the
Decemberholidays,whenArgen-.
tina's simmering social conflicts
have a history of exploding in the
summer heat.
President Cristina Fernan-
dez's Cabinet chief, Jorge Capi-
tanich, described the crimes as
premeditated actsby groups that
wanted to generate chaos and
anxiety on the eve of Tuesday's
30th anniversary of Argentina's
return to democracy.
"In some ways, this amounts
to the crime of treason," Capi-
tanich told reporters. He said
that the national government
was in continual contact with
Argentina's provincial leaders
and that any salary dispute must
be resolved through negotiation,
not extortion:
The government has sent fed-
eral police, border patrol officers
and other security forces to hot

spots where people have armed
themselves in fear of mobs. Pros-
ecutors were put on alertto build
criminal cases against looters,
and Justice Minister Julio Alak
warned that people coordinat-
ing violence through social net-
works would be charged.
Looting first broke out in Cor-
doba province last week, dam-
aging hundreds of businesses
and leaving two dead and more
than 100 people injured before
the governor and police reached
a deal that effectively doubled
police salaries to 12,000 pesos a
month. That's about $1,915 at the
official exchange rate.
The national government imi-
tially blamed the phenomenon
on Cordoba's governor, a politi-
cal rival of Fernandez. But by
Monday, it was clear that even
close presidential allies were
struggling as police earning base
salaries of less than 6,000 pesos
a month staged copy-cat strikes
across Argentina.
A third victim died when his
supermarket was set afire as he
defended it from a mob in Almi-
rante Brown, in Buenos Aires
province, where Fernandez loy-
alist Gov. Daniel Scioli appealed
for calm. The fourth and fifth
victims were young men who
were inside stores being looted
in Entre Rios and Jujuy prov-
inces.
Scioli's leadership was tested
again Monday after a dozen
more stores were looted in Mar
del Plata and hundreds of police
gathered in a central square,
rejecting his offer to raise entry-
level salaries to what he called a
"fair and reasonable" 8,570 pesos
a month. Those officers were
holding out for 12,500 as a base
salary. Most others returned to
work, the provincial govern-
ment said.

Canada wants to
claim resource
rich Arctic land

Coalition wants Obama
to l imit NSA surveillance

.Eight companies
publish open letter
asking the president
to limit programs
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sili-
con Valley is escalating pres-
sure on President Barack
Obama to curb the U.S. govern-
ment surveillance programs
that vacuum personal informa-
tion off the Internet and threat-
en the technology industry's
financial livelihood.
A coalition that includes
Google, Apple, Yahoo, Face-
book and Microsoft lashed out
in an open letter printed Mon-
day in major newspapers and a
new website, http://reformgov-
ernmentsurveillance.com.
The crusade united eight
companies that often compete
fiercely against each other, but
now find themselves banding
together to limit the potential
damage from revelations about
the National Security Agency's
snooping on Web surfers.
Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp.
and AOL Inc. joined Google
Inc., Apple Inc., Yahoo Inc.,
Facebook Inc. and Microsoft
Corp. in the push for tighter
controls over electronic espio-
nage. The group is immersed in
the lives of just about everyone
who uses the Internet or a com-
puting device.
As the companies' services
and products have become
more deeply ingrained in soci-
ety, they have become integral
cogs in the economy.
Their prosperity also pro-
vides them with the cash to
pay for lobbyists and fund cam-
paign contributions that sway
public policy.

Monday's public relations
offensive is a by-product of
documents leaked over the past
six months by former NSA con-
tractor Edward Snowden. The
records reveal that the NSA
has been obtaining emails and
other personal data from major
tech companies under secret
court orders for the past five
years and scooping up other
data through unauthorized
hacking into data centers.
Silicon Valley has been fight-
ing back in the courts and in
Congress as they seek reforms
that would allow them to dis-
close more information about
secret court orders.
Several of the companies are
also introducing more encryp-
tion technology to shield their
users' data from government
spies and other prying eyes.
Monday's letter and the new
anti-snooping website repre-
sent the technology industry's
latest salvo in an attempt to
counter any perception that
they voluntarily give the gov-
ernment access to users' email
and other sensitive informa-
tion.
Although the campaign is
ostensibly directed at govern-
ments around the world, the
U.S. is clearly the main target.
"The balance in many coun-'
tries has tipped too far in favor
of the state and away from the
rights of the individual - rights
that are enshrined in our Con-
stitution," the letter said. "This
undermines the freedoms
we all cherish. It's time for a
change."
Civil liberties aren't the only
thing at stake. One of the rea-
sons the technology compa-
nies have become a rich vein
for crime-fighting authorities
is that they routinely store vast

amounts of personal data as
part of their efforts to tailor
services and target advertising.
By analyzingsearch requests,
Web-surfing habits, social net-
working posts and even the
content of emails, the compa-
nies are able to determine, for
instance, the type of digital ads
to show individual users.
The NSA revelations have
raised fears that people might
shy away from some Internet
services or share less informa-
tion about themselves.
Such a shift would make it
more difficult for companies to
increase their ad revenue and;
ultimately, boost their stock
prices.In a statement, Yahoo
CEO Marissa Mayer said the
NSA disclosures had "shaken
the trust of our users."
Google CEO Larry Page and
Facebook CEO Mark Zucker-
berg, two of the richest people
in the world, also chimed with
statements urging the U.S. to
adopt reforms to protect per-
sonal information.
U.S. intelligence officials
have staunchly defended the
electronic espionage, con-
tending the NSA's tactics have
helped disrupt terror attacks.
Officials also insist that the
agency takes care not to look at
the content of conversations or
messages by U.S. citizens. -
Obama has asked a panel of
hand-picked advisers to report
on the spying issue this month
and recently said he'll pro-
pose the NSA use "some self-
restraint" in handling data.
White House spokeswom-
an Caitlin Hayden indicated
the administration expects to
address many of the concerns
raised in Monday's letter after
Obama's advisers complete
their review.

Plans made to
'assert sovereignty'
and extend seabed
into North Pole
TORONTO (AP) - Canada
plans tomake a claim to the
North Pole in an effort to assert
its sovereignty in the resource-
rich Arctic, the country's
foreign affairs minister said
Monday.
John Baird said the govern-
ment has asked scientists to
work on a future submission
to the United Nations claiming
that the outer limits of the coun-
try's continental shelf include
the pole, which so far has been
claimed by no one.
Canada last week applied to
extend its seabed claims in the
Atlantic Ocean, including some
preliminary Arctic claims, but
it wants more time to prepare
a claim that would include the
pole.
Asserting Canada's rights in
the Arctic has been a popular
domestic issue for Prime Min-
ister Stephen Harper, though
at least one expert on the issue
described the planned claim as
a long shot.
"We are determined to ensure
that all Canadians benefit from
the tremendous resources that
are to be found in Canada's far
north," Baird said.
Countries including the U.S.
and Russia are increasingly
looking to the Arctic as a source
of natural resources and ship-
ping lanes.
The U.S. Geological Survey
says the region contains 30 per-
cent of the world's undiscovered
natural gas and 15 percent of oil.
If Canada's claim is accepted by
the U.N. commission, it would
dramatically grow its share.
Countries must submit pro-
posals to the U.N. Commission
on the Limits of the Continental

Shelf to request an extension of
their nautical borders. Current-
ly, under international law, Can-
ada, Denmark, Norway, Russia
and the U.S. -the five countries
with territories near the Arctic
Circle are allotted 200 nauti-
cal miles from their northern
coasts.
Under the U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea, exclusive
claims can be vastly expanded
for Arctic nations that prove
that their part of the continental
shelf extends beyond that zone.
Baird said Canada's submis-
sion last week set out the poten-
tial outer limits of the country's
continental shelf in the Atlan-
tic - a claim of about 1.2 mil-
lion square kilometers. He said
that's roughly the size of Alber-
ta and Saskatchewan combined.
Canada's follow-up submis-
sion will include a claim to the
Lomonosov Ridge, an undersea
mountain range between Elles-
mere Island, Canada's most
northern land mass, and Rus-
sia's east Siberian coast. That
claim would extend Canada's
claim 200 nautical miles beyond
the North Pole.
The submission that Canada
filed with the U.N. is essentially
a series of undersea co-ordi-
nates that map what the gov-
ernment claims is the country's
extended continental shelf.
Baird said it's a mammoth
task, and the government needs
more time to complete the map-
ping in the Arctic and get its
U.N. submission right.
"That's why we have asked
our officials and scientists to do
additional and necessary work
to ensure that a submission for
the full extent of the Continen-
tal Shelf in the Arctic includes
Canada's claim to the North
Pole," he said.
The U.N. submission is also
political, said Michael Byers, an
expert on Arctic and interna-
tional law at the University of
British Columbia.

Ree valuatingevaluation~s
Centralizing course information has benefits for professors and students
s the fall semester comes to a close, it's open season for course
evaluations. Feedback from students is an integral part of the Uni-
versity's self-improvement, explaining the professorial exhorta-
tions that go along with the evaluations. Unfortunately, few students are
willing to fill out these evaluations. As much as students are responsible
for filling them out, it is the role of professors to demonstrate the impact
of these criticisms. Additionally, information regarding class structure,
such as syllabi and evaluations, should be more centralized to allow stu-

Anyone who's invested in
social justice work - as
loose and vague as the
term is - knows
that it isn't easy.
On most days it
feels defeating
and depleting to
the point where
you may guiltily
question what
you are doing or ZEINAB
why you're the
one who has to
take this on.
It can push
you to distrust the world, recoil into
your couch and start a "Scandal"
marathon when you should really
be working on job applications or
doing the statistics homework that
was due yesterday.
But as much as it may bother some
people, the vagueness lent to "social
justice" can be useful in pushing us
to rethink what anti-oppressive work
looks like in different contexts.
Resisting oppression - or at least
its normalization - comes in differ-
ent forms and sometimes in ways
that we don't highlight or value as
much..While anti-oppressive work
may evoke images of radical orga-
nizing or perhaps images of more
reformist approaches that seek to
fight "within the system," maybe
through negotiating with people
in positions of influence, liberation
comes in many more shadet.
Resistance can play out in the
everyday small steps we take, in the
seemingly mundane things we do,
that, if intentionally proactive and
subversive, can be powerful ways to
disrupt the status quo.
Rethinking resistance starts by
dropping any lofty fixed image in
our mind of what anti-oppressive/'
liberation work looks like. Falling
into what we think "social justice" or
"activism" ought to look like or what
it requires limits our imagination,
and subsequently, the impact of our
work. Truly challenging the status
quo around us won't happen by abid-
ing by the script of the mainstream.
Instead, we need to think of ways
to define resistance work on our
own terms; to make it fit the shift-
ing needs and nuances of our every-
day realities.
If we want to survive in sys-
tems where our numbers are few
or where there are many external
restraints against us, we need to

imagine resistance thatc
tion in spaces that aren't w
or conducive of tradition
of activism. This requires
more proactive in what
to invest our energy in, a
ways to be subversive in
where activism isn't deem
priate. By doing so, we can

dents to compare courses.
As it stands, rates of completion for the
course evaluations is low with only 56 per-
cent of students participating at any course
level during Fall 2012. This rate tends to stay
consistent from year to year - increasing by
only 1.66 percent from Fall 2011.
An obvious disconnect exists between stu-
dents and faculty about of the importance of
these evaluations. Professors and graduate
student instructors need to make it explic-
itly clear how essential students' feedback is
to improving the course. Professors should
set aside time at the end of the final class to
give students the opportunity to complete the
evaluation, which would highlight the impor-
tance of student opinions.
Faculty should also ensure that stu-
dents can ,see how their feedback may
affect instruction changes in the future. For
instance, professors should e-mail students
after responses have been read, acknowledg-
ing common criticisms and praises for the
course, and describing planned improve-
ments. Providing students with informa-
tion about how their evaluations are utilized
demonstrates that their opinion is actually
considered. Obviously, an increase in stu-
dent participation would be more useful to
instructors;because they would have more.,

opinions and feedback to draw from.
Evaluations also need to be documented in
an online database that is easily accessible
to students. A consolidated resource would
allows students to consider the evaluation
of their peers when they navigate classes on
Wolverine Access. The average student per-
spective offered in these evaluations would
provide a more trustworthy opinion than
websites like Rate My Professor, which lends
itself to participation bias and creates unreli-
able information. To assist students ih select-
ing courses, professors should be required to
upload past or tentative syllabi to one central
website - allowing students to compare the
workload and structure of different courses.
The syllabus archive on the LSA's course
guide site does notcontain all courses, leaving
students without an adequate understanding
of what their future class may look like.
Providing better transparency in the course
review system will ultimately demonstrate to
students that it is in their best interest to con-
tribute to the mutually beneficial program. In
the meantime, providing students with time
in class and feedback about changes based on
their responses will increase participation -
ultimately leadingto improved instructor per-
formance and better courses.

This is the message thousands
of University of Michigan students
awoke to Tuesday morning. Fortu-
nately, the eviction notice was a tool
of political satire intended to recreate
a situation thousands of Palestinians
confront on a daily basis. Even while
this parallel was created on our cam-
pus, it's impossible to understand the
violent trauma associated with the
uprooting and displacement of fami-
lies and homes. We can only begin to
imagine the physical, emotional and
psychological lossthathappens when
homes and communities - embed-
ded with memories, dignity and live-
lihood - are reduced to rubble.
Since 1967, the Israeli government
has demolished more than 27,000
Palestinian homes. Last month,
Israeli authorities posted eviction
orders on 200 residentialbuildings in
East Jerusalem that will leave more
than 15,000 Palestinians homeless.
No alternatives are left for these soon-
to-be displaced populations. While
University of Michigan students who
received the mock eviction notices
can rest assured knowing that they
will not be forcibly uprooted from
their cozy quarters, they also will not
be subjected to the $19,400 fine Pal-
estinian families are forced to pay if
they refuse to demolish their homes
themselves and leave the humiliating
task to Israeli authorities.
The discrimination against Pales-
tinian and Israeli Arabs from their
Jewish counterparts is disturbing.
While Palestinian homes are unlaw-
fully demolished, illegal settlements
in East Jerusalem and the Westbank
continue to be built. While Palestin-
ians are forced to pay hefty fines
if they do not demolish their own
homes, Israelis are paid to live in ille-
gal settlements. In fact, most Israe-
lis move to settlements not because
of religious, ideological or political

reasons, but for the sake of economic
convenience due to subsidies that
make living in illegal settlements
cheaper than in Israel.
Of course, all of this is in gross
violation of human rights. Under
the Geneva Convention, any forcible
population transfer is strictly forbid-
den. But the Israeli government does
not have to answer to international
law or human rights. Its blatant dis-
regard for human dignity and sur-
vival is supported and made possible
by us - the United States - who have
vetoed a total of 41 Security Council
resolutions that indict Israel over its
numerous war crimes.
So, what now? The so-called
"peace process" has proven only as
a way to buy time and protect the
expansion of settlements that make
a just resolution unlikely. Israeli
settlements and their expansive
network of checkpoints and segre-
gated road systems fragment Pal-
estinian land, break apart families
and take huge tolls on the Pales-
tinian economy. What Palestinian
state can we speak of when 82 per-
cent of the West Bank is under
Israeli military rule and 61 percent
of it is under full Israeli control?
The miserable futility of the peace
process is too. evident by recent
developments: While U.S. Secretary
of State John Kerry tries to renew
"peace talks," the Israeli ministry
announces the construction of 300
new settlement homes in East Jeru-
salem. The U.S. State Department
described the move as "counterpro-
ductive."
In view of Israel's legal and politi-
cal impunity and the absence of real
dialogue, it is time for us as students
at the University of Michigan to
take the stand that our government
has yet to make. In 2005, Palestin-
ian civil society called for a -global
citizens' response to these injustices
implementing boycott, divestment
and sanctions against Israel until it
complies with international law. In
doingso, Palestinian civil society has
proposed a morally consistent, effec-
tive and nonviolent method to resist

the continued colonization and eth-
nic cleansing of their lands.
The Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions movement has been
endorsed by prominent figures,
such as South African liberation
leaders Desmond Tutu and Nelson
Mandela, and is beginning to devel-
op into a truly global movement.
Just last week, the American Stud-
ies Association passed the academic
boycott of Israeli institutions. Sev-
eral American university student
bodies, including University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley, have passed reso-
lutions asking their universities to
divest from all companies profiting
from the Israeli occupation. The
time is now for us to do the same.
At its core, BDS is about adherence
to human rights. It asks nothing con-
troversial - only that we uphold our
moral standards and practice what
we preach. Divesting from Israel
would mean divesting from compa-
nies that have explicit ties with the
Israeli occupation - companies that
engage in the likes of selling military
technology that aids in the killing of
civilians, managing racially segre-
gated bus systems and providing ser-
vices to illegal settlements.
Our University has an established
tradition of dissent and activism.
This campus has historically been
a space for students to raise their
political and global consciousness
and become harbingers of social
change whether it was through pry-
ing open the doors of higher educa-
tion to minority students, protesting
the war in Vietnam, or divesting
from South African Apartheid in
1983. By remaining neutral on the
"Israeli apartheid," we're complicit
in a system of oppression.
As Martin Luther King Jr. said,
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere." Our demand is
that you recognize this injustice and
divest from all companies that profit
from the Israeli occupation.

While Whitener said he agrees
that costs should be cut at the
University, he believes AST is
not the right way to do it. He said
upper-level administrators' sala-

unnecessary" construction proj-
ects that cost millions. SUM has
previously voiced its opposition

serves and better plan for income

Paul Castillo, chief financial
officer for UMHS, noted that the
analyses are only mathematical
equations used to make predic-
tions based on the current land-
scape. The majority of financial
adjustments will occur in the
coming year, once the system has
been observed and analyzed.
"It's too early to tell what
exactly is going to happen in the
exchange marketplace today,"
Castillo said. "This next 12
months is a very important time
period for us to really observe
what's happening in the mar-
ketplace and incorporate those
observations into our financial
modeling."
As some individuals begin
enrolling in health insurance for
the first time, others may have
the option to switch plans. These
migrations between systems per-
haps provide the most uncertain-
ty for healthcare providers, since
it will be difficult to accurately
estimate the new demograph-
ics until the system has been in
place for several months.
The reimbursement that
UMHS receives will strongly
depend on what portion of their
patients decide to take advantage
of Medicaid or Medicare, which
typically have lower reimburse-
ment rates than private insurers.
In any case, it will likely require
the health system to find ways
to be more efficient with the
resources available.
"If we were paid at Medicare
reimbursement rates, we would
actually see a lower overall pay-
ment level for the portion that
migrates," Castillo said. "Under
either scenario, there is a predic-
tion of lower reimbursement in
total, but the reality is we don't
know if that's going to be the
case or not."
Regardless of the uncertain-
ty, Castillo said the process of
reform was necessary given the
state of health coverage in the
United States In 2012, the U.S.
Census Bureau estimated that

15.4 percent of Americans lacked
health insurance, or 48 million
people.
"The elements of the Afford-
able Care Act that are attempting
to provide access at a reasonable
cost to a portion of the popula-
tion that has historically had

early to predict the future plans
for the consolidation initiative,
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack and Tim Slottow, executive
vice president and chief financial
officer, are currently speaking to
concerned faculty members to
gauge their opinions.
"We will continue that impor-
tant dialogue as we work together
to evaluate the different options
for structuring shared services in
the near future," Pollack said in a
statement.
Earlier this year, the University
signed an $11.7-million contract
with Accenture LLP, a Chicago-
based consulting firm, to help
facilitate the AST consolidation
process. Miranda previously
worked for the firm, but Slot-
tow said in November Miranda
removed himself from firm rela-
tions "to eliminate any possibility
of real or perceived bias."
Rackham student Diana Sierra,
a member of GEO, said the AST
consolidation efforts would hurt
the least financially stable staff

on campus and a disproportionate
amount of women employees.
"I see this as a very explicit
attack on the workers at campus,"
Sierra said. "You see that the Uni-
versity is trying to handle a so-
called budget crisis on the backs
of its most vulnerable workers,
and I think that's part of a bigger
issue as to who has decision-mak-
ing power on campus."
Although Sierra said that
workers would be potentially laid
off with the implementation of
AST, University officials said in
November that there will be no
layoffs as a result of the new Cen-
ter.
Rackham student Paige Ander-
sson said decreasing resources for
the lower-level workers on cam-
pus sheds light on what she sees
as the larger goals of the financial
framework at the University.
"The focus is away from educa-
tion and the resources to provide
an affordable education - which
affects diversity and all sorts of
other things - to basically enrich

people at the top," Anderson said.
Sierra echoed Anderson's
points about financialization at
the University - one of SUM's
main issues. As the University's
Black Student Union recently
made national news by bringing
the experiences of Black students
- who constitute 4.65 percent of
enrolled students - on campus to
light, Sierra said college afford-
ability for students from diverse
backgrounds should be the Uni-
versity's top priority.
While the University's enroll-
ment does not directly relate to
the fight against AST, Sierra said
it reflects a larger issue of who has
the decision-making power on
campus.
"I think this initiative is part
of a larger effort to really address
those diversity questions in a way
that is not an empty buzzword
(like) the University wants to
paint in their pamphlets, but that
if you're actually interested, you
actually need to have people be a
part of the process."

sity's use of consulting firms.

national expertise in fields
including business, finance,
information technologies,
organizations and education."



difficulty getting access to insur-
ance - I think those are good
tenants," Castillo said.
Enrollment will be complicat-
ed for Michiganders
In the state of Michigan, more
than one million individuals -
about 14 percent of the popula-
tion - are currently uninsured.
Given the confusion and issues
with enrollment, many of these
Michiganders may remain unin-
sured into 2014.
"I would guess that less than
half of the uninsured in Michi-
gan will gain coverage by the
deadline - probably substan-
tially less than half," said Public
Health Prof. Richard Hirth, an
expert on healthcare policy.
Recently, however, healthcare
coverage has not been the focus
of criticism. Rather, the federal
enrollment system - Health-
care.gov - has been facing the
brunt of condemnation, primar-
ily from conservative opponents,
given its myriad technical issues
and delays.
Although recent-reports have
indicated improvement in the
federal exchange system, it has
yet to be seen whether modifica-
tions to the system will translate
into higher enrollment rates.
In contrast to the federal
exchange, many states have been
successfully operating indepen-
dent enrollment programs. Four-
teen states took this option when
the law was introduced, granting
them federal funding to establish
their own healthcare enrollment
websites. While preliminary
results appear varied, seveyal
states, including Kentucky and
California, are currently operat-
ing systems that largely outper-
form the federal exchange.
Michigan had the option to
establish a state-based exchange,
but decided to utilize the federal
system instead, a move Hirth
said was motivated more by poli-
tics than other factors.
"Not having a state-based
exchange was largely politi-
cal," Hirth said. "You could
make your political statement
against the ACA, but ultimately,
since you would have the federal
exchange available, you wouldn't
have thought there would be that
much of a consequence."
Hirth does not place. blame,
however, entirely on the fed-
eral government, which likely
expected a larger portion of
states to take control of their
own enrollment sites.
"I don't think the federal gov-

ernment ever anticipated that
they'd be doing the exchange
for 36 states," Hirth said. "That
really contributed to a lot of the
problems with the rollout."
Each state added to the system
must be linked into numerous
databases and calculations must
be calibrated based on the state
laws and regulations. This pro-
cess is not only time consuming
but also highly prone to error.
"Health insurance is a compli-
cated product," Hirth said. "It's
more complicated than simply
setting up a website to sell it."
Confounding the enrollment
problems, Michigan Medicaid
expansions, which will extend
coverage to a large portion of'
the uninsured population, won't
take effect until March because
of delays in approval by the
U.S. Department }of Health and
Human Services and Michigan's
state legislature. Once in effect,
Hirth estimates just over half of*
the previously uninsured indi-
viduals will be covered under an
insurance policy.
Under the expanded Medicaid
qualifications, individuals whose
incomes are less than 133 per-
cent of the federal poverty level
will receive coverage at little or
no expense.
Young adults are a driving
force for cost
While the long-term goal of
the ACA is to reduce costs for
patients and healthcare provid-
ers, this may not be the case in
the coming year. Uncertainty
regarding the demographics
of the newly insured suggests
the annual premiums for some
plans may see an increase in
2014 as insurers equilibrate their
expenses.
"In the first year of the
exchanges, the plans were guess-
ing," Hirth said. "They had to
make their best projection as to
who is likely to enroll in a plan
and those projections are cer-
tainly at risk right now given the
slow pace of enrollment."
More than 470,000 of the
uninsured Michiganders, about
42 percent, are between the ages
of 19 and 34, according to HHS.
Although Hirth estimates the
percentage ofuninsured students
at the University is in the single
digits, these younger - generally
healthier - populations have
proven resistant to mandated.
coverage requirements. Many
students with no income are
essentially exempt from penal-
ties for failing to enroll, which

are assessed throqgh income tax.
Without these younger demo-
graphics enrolling, there are
fewer individuals to cover the
cost of care for many plans, thus
driving up prices for those who
choose to participate.
When Massachusetts passed a
statewide healthcare reform law
in 2006, which required citizens
to obtain insurance or pay a pen-
alty, the people in the greatest
need of insurance - those with
costly diseases and disabilities
- were the first to enroll. With
several weeks of enrollment
remaining, Hirth said many leg-
islators have been presuming
that national enrollment would
follow this pattern.
"It remains to be seen whether
the younger, healthier folks are
discouraged from enrolling alto-
gether as opposed to just waiting
until the last minute to make a
decision," Hirth said. "We don't
know yet whether that Massa-
chusetts experience will be fol-
lowed given that we've had a lot
more problems than they did."
Regardless of how they'll be
affected, some just don't get it
Helen Morgan, assistant pro-
fessor of obstetrics and gynecol-
ogy, teaches the undergraduate
course, "Perspectives on Health
Care." In her experience, she has
found that very few people are
properly educated on healthcare
options and policies.
"The reality is that people
don't understand it," Morgan
said. "There's so much rhetoric
and there's so much dogma and
everyone's just trying to figure
out what is the actual reality."
Given the polarized opinions
on healthcare reform, many indi-
viduals who see Morgan have
received false information from
biased sources. Moving forward,
she said the University holds
some responsibility, along-with
the administration, for educat-
ing the public on these issues.
But even in these early stages
of implementation, Morgan said
some effects are already being
seen in the health system. Most
notable in her practice, she has
been reminding patients that
certain forms of birth control are
covered under the new law.
"Prior to the Affordable Care
Act, I had a lot of patients whose
insurance plans wouldn't cover
any contraception, so we had to
make up these bogus reasons for
why they needed something just
so we could have the insurance
company pay for it," Morgan said.

PROJECT

after two years rather than just
delayed for that amount of time.
"It would allow people to have
a meaningful dialogue," Oey
said. She added that there isn't
enough information right now to
rush into a decision.
Dario Gaggio, associate pro-
fessor of history, said the motion
should call for the implementa-
tion to be called off completely
so as to avoid sending a mixed
message. However, the faculty
group defeated the amendment.
Dowd stressed that the imple-
mentation of AST should be
reconsidered only if the admin-
istrators and faculty members
open a dialogue and properly
investigate the costs, benefits
and alternatives.
"I think a number of us felt
that ... we would be engaging in
exactly the kind of, 'we know
better than you' that we feel we
are getting from the administra-
tion," Dowd said. "Maybe there
are parts of AST that are sal-

vageable."
Some faculty members had
mixed feelings about the pro-
posed motion and the amend-
ments. Information Prof. Paul
Edwards said the nature of the
transformation may be widely
misunderstood by faculty mem-
bers.
"I urge restraint on this,"
Edwards said. "I do not feel that
I know what AST means on any
level. I feel that it has been deeply
studied by the administration."
Although administrators sent
out a letter in November that
promised there would be no
layoffs resulting from the tran-
sition, others at the meeting
warned that the effects of AST
and the Shared Service Center
will occur by default without
the actual implementation as
employees quit to find more sta-
ble positions or their contracts
expire without renewal.
In a statement, Pollack said
the University delayed the
implementation to hear from
more faculty and will continue
the dialogue to evaluate differ-
ent options.


NOISE
From Page 1
music, even though they may not
think they're listening to it very
loudly. Subjects also suffered
from involuntary exposure on
subways and in the workplace.
In a dangerous twist, Neitzel
said the more serious conse-
quences, such as heart attacks,
occur at lower levels than
required for hearing loss. Thus,
individuals may not realize they
are being over-exposed.
Hearing loss has the poten-
tial to occur ifa person's average
exposure over 24 hours exceeds
70 decibels, or about as loud as a
normal conversation, according
to Neitzel.
"You can certainly have high
noise during the day, you just
need to have periods of quiet as
well so it all averages out," Neit-
zel said.
However, for students, expo-
sure can potentially be much
higher. Attending a noisy party
or rock concert can expose indi-
viduals to levels as high as 110
decibels, which represents a
10,000-fold increase from the
minimum level necessary for
hearing loss.
"Any time you have ringing
in your ears after noise - some
people get a sensation that the
sound is muffled - that's basi-
cally the only way your body has
to tell you that's too much noise,"
Neitzel said. "If you are leaving
a noisy event, and your ears are
ringing, or it sounds like you're
underwater, that's a sign you
got too much noise and probably

ought to not do that again."
Many people ignore such
ringing because it does not
hurt, but Neitzel said ears do
not actually hurt until about 125
decibels, which is well above
the level necessary for hearing
loss.
Ann Arbor City Code of Ordi-
nances states that individuals
cannot undertake any activity
that produces over 61 decibels
of noise beyond their property
line between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
Between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., the
permitted level drops to 55 deci-
bels.
While this code provides basic
protection from most noise dan-
gers, Neitzel said most munici-
pal police forces around the
United States are ill-equipped or
too busy to enforce noise regula-
tions.
"There are many towns where
there are no rules at all," Neit-
zel said. "Cities don't have the
resources on their own, for the
most part, to take on noise as a
problem."
Some cities, like San Francis-
co, now require concert venues
to provide or sell hearing protec-
tion to patrons. But despite such
efforts, noise hazards have yet
to gain the same level of nation-
al regulation that other haz-
ards, such as air pollution, have
received.
"Cities and counties are just
sort of making it up as they go,
rather than us taking a compre-
hensive look and saying let's do
this right," Neitzel said. "Some
cities have taken the right steps,
such as Ann Arbor, but most
have not."

Princeton fights meningitis outbreak

Nearly 2,000
students given
vaccinne in first day
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -
Princeton University has begun
vaccinating nearly 6,000 stu-
dents to try to stop an outbreak of
type B meningitis in an unusual
federal government-endorsed
administration of a drug not gen-
4 erally approved for use in the
United States.
Seven students and one pro-
spective student who was visit-
ingcampus have been stricken by
potentially life-threatening type
B meningococcal disease since
March. None of the cases has
been fatal.
Scores of students were lined
up in a campus center when the
vaccinations became available

Monday. Nearly 2,000 received
shots the first day. Vaccines are
being given through Thursday,
and a booster dose will be given
in February.
The vaccinations were recom-
mended by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
The vaccine is being made avail-
able to all undergraduates, as
well as graduate students who
live in dorms and employees with
certain medical conditions. Tak-
ing it is voluntary.
Under New Jersey law, all
students who live in dorms are
required to have a meningitis
vaccine, but it does not prevent
the B strain, which responds dif-
ferently to vaccines from other
strains. The strain is the most
common in Europe and account-
ed for one-third of the meningi-
tis cases reported in the U.S. last
year by the CDC. Princeton's is

the first outbreak of the B strain
worldwide this year.
On campus Monday, students
were amused at the presence of
reporters interested in wheth-
er they had gotten a shot, or
planned to.
"It's hard to take it seriously
even though I know it's a seri-
ous situation," Ryan McDonnell,
a 20-year-old junior, said after
receiving the vaccine. "I never
considered not getting it."
He said that the experience,
including filling out a consent
form and waiting 15 minutes
after the shot was given, took less
than 30 minutes.
Another 20-year-old junior,
Jimmy van Thron, said he was
planning to get the vaccine in
coming days.
"My mom's a pediatrician, and
she told me to,"he said. "So, gotta
do what mom says."

With the most recent case
reported in November, the CDC
said there was a strong likeli-
hood of more cases despite steps
taken by the university, includ-
ing encouraging students not to
share cups. The agency says it's
important as many students as
possible get vaccinated to help
halt the outbreak. The disease
can be spread through kissing,
coughing or lengthy contact.
The Food and Drug Admin-
istration authorized the use of a
vaccine, Bexsero, that has been
approved for use in Canada,
Europe and Australia but is not
yet licensed in the U.S.
Made by Switzerland-based
Novartis, Bexsero is the only
vaccine designed to ward off the
strain. It is in the approval pipe-
line in the United States. The
CDC said it does not consider it
experimental.

Snow and cold
hit U.S. a month
before usual
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -
Snow and bitter cold snarled
traffic and prompted another
1,650 U.S. flight cancella-
tions on Monday, and tens of
thousands of people were still
without power after Janu-
ary-like weather barged in a
month early.
The storm covered parts
of North Texas in ice over
the weekend and then moved
East. Below-zero tempera-
tures crowned the top of the
U.S. from Idaho to Minnesota,
where many roads still had an
inch-thick plate of ice, pol-
ished smooth by traffic and
impervious to ice-melting
chemicals, making intersec-
tions an adventure.
Many travelers wished they
were home, and people in

homes without power wished
they were somewhere else.
Some of the most difficult
conditions were in North
Texas. More than 22,000 Dal-
las-area homes and business-
es were still without power on
Monday, according to electric
utility Oncor. That was down
from 270,000 on Friday. Dal-
las students got a snow day.
More than half of the
nation's flight cancellations
on Monday were at Dallas-
Fort Worth International Air-
port, dominated by American
Airlines. About 650 travelers
were stranded there Sunday
night.
Nationally, there have been
more than 6,100 flight can-
cellations since Saturday,
according to FlightStats.com,
including more than 2,800
by American or its American
Eagle regional airline. Ameri-
can emerged from bankruptcy
protection and merged with
US Airways on Monday.

We're playing at home, and that's

The Wolverines will play their
final game of the semester dur-
ing the midst of finals week, and
are feeling the pressure in< the
classroom as much as on the ice.
Though classes officially end
Wednesday and the earliest finals
are scheduled for Friday, most
papers will be due before game
time.
"For me personally, it's tough,"
Bennett said. "I have a 10-page

due and exams this week, so it's
hard."
MORE THAN ONE MOTTE:
Freshman forward Tyler Motte
will play in front of 100 of his clos-
est friends and family on Wednes-
day when Michigan takes on the
Bulldogs.
Ferris State enters Wednesday's
contest as the WCHA leader, rid-
ing a nation-best 13-game winning
streak behind junior goaltender
CJ Motte - Tyler's older brother.
Standing just 6-feet tall in the
net, CJ is 13-0-2 in 15 games this
season and boasts a .925 save
percentage. Meanwhile, Tyler
notched his second assist of the
season against the NTDP, his for-
mer team, on Thursday and has
tallied five goals this season.
"For me, it's just another game,"
Tyler said of the matchup. "(CJ)
will have the same mindset. He
competes hard every day. He's
been known as undersized, but
he's made up for it. He's performed
all three years that he's been there
so far, soit will be a tough task for
us."

good minutes have progressed
and progressed," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico.
Driscoll's role expanded once
again in Michigan's Big Ten/ACC
Challenge victory over Virginia.
In her second consecutive game
as a starter, Driscoll set a career
high with 12 points in the Wol-
verines' rout, going 6-for-6 from
the field,
Smith's imminent return
means Driscoll's role will change
once more. Barnes Arico estimat-
ed that the injured guard prac-
ticed at about 75 percent Monday,
moving more than she had since
her injury. But Barnes Arico says
Smith is still in pain, and her sta-
tus for Wednesday's game against
Eastern Michigan is still unde-
cided.
When Smith is fully healthy,
Driscoll's improved play provides
intriguing options for Barnes
Arico - ones she didn't think
she'd have at the beginning of
the season. Not only can Driscoll
help relieve Michigan's top three
guards, who each average over
34 minutes per game, but she
also expands the flexibility of the
Wolverines' matchups.
"If we're going with a smaller,
quickerteam, we mighthave to go
with four guards," Barnes Arico
said. "If we're facing a bigger
team, we might have to go with
two bigs. It's nice now that we
have Val playing so well that she
could really give us that option."
After three years without
meaningful minutes, Michigan's
tallest player has ensured that
she is no longer just a face on the
sidelines.

A

court last season and was one of a
slew of Michigan players who fell
victim to anterior crucial liga-
ment injuries.
Before that, her playing time
was minimal - 61 minutes in 16
games her freshman year and 19
minutes in six games as a sopho-
more.
Things have changed for
Driscoll this season. The Wol-
verines (6-3) entered the season
lacking frontcourt depth, but
the senior was one of the players
who could provide it. Driscoll has
played in all nine games and has
totaled 171 minutes (averaging 19

of her career on the big stage
against the Lady Tigers. She set
career highs with 11 rebounds,
six blocks and 37 minutes. The
Wolverines led for most of the
second half and nearly pulled off
the upset before losing in the final
moments, 64-62.
After three years on the side-
lines, Driscoll provided more
than just a fifth body on the
court. She grabbed key rebounds
and blocked shots throughout the
near upset.
"I think she started the begin-
ning of the year giving us a good

down Indi-
ana, 69-52. After a close first half,
the fourth-ranked Orange put
the foot on the pedal and out-
scored the Hoosiers, 36-23, in the
last20minutes to coastto ablow-
out victory.
The other new ACC school,
Pittsburgh, followed a similar
blueprint to victory, beating Penn
State, 78-69, after trailing by two
at halftime.
Michigan traveled to No. 8
Duke in the biggest game of the
night, and the Blue Devils easily
took hobbled sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas out of the game
on the offensive end to defeat
the Wolverines. Michigan never
truly challenged Duke in the sec-
ond half and never managed to
cut the deficit to closer than six.
In Wednesday's tilts, the Big
Ten clawed back to force a tie in
the challenge for just the second
time in the event's history. The
all-time record moved to 10-3-2
in the ACC's favor.
No. 3 Ohio State kept its unde-
feated season alive, defeating
future Big Ten member Mary-
land, 76-60. Wisconsin also
remained unbeaten by defeating
Virginia, 48-38. Despite shoot-

ing just 28.8 percent from the
field, the fourth-ranked Badgers
earned coach Bo Ryan his 300th
career win with the program.
They also continued their best
start since 1993-94, when they
went11games without a loss.
In the primetime game of the
night, No. 5 Michigan State host-
ed a North Carolina team that
had already experienced some
exhilarating highs and brutal
lows this season, including losses
to Belmont and a win against No.
6 Louisville. Wednesday night,
the Tar Heels struck gold again
as they defeated the Spartans,
79-65. North Carolina pulled
away in the second half, play-
ing at a fast pace to outscore
Michigan State by 14 and give
the Spartans their first loss to an
unranked non-conference team
at home in over a decade.
The upset also opened up the
door for a new team to take over
the top slot in the nation. And
after defeating UNLV Saturday,
Arizona claimed it.
Michigan will host the Wild-
cats on Saturday at Crisler Center
with the opportunity to defeat
the nation's No. 1 team for just
the third time in program histo-
ry. The Wolverines last managed
the feat on Dec. 13, 1997 when
they toppled Duke, 81-73.
Ohio State's LaQuinton Ross
was named Big Ten Player of
the Week after he averaged 2L5
points and six rebounds in the
Buckeyes' wins over Maryland
and Central Connecticut State.
Indiana's Noah Vonleh earned
Big Ten Freshman of the Week
honors for the third time. The
6-foot-10 forward averaged 15
points and 8.5 rebounds in the
Hoosiers' two games against
Syracuse and North Florida. He
is averaging 13.3 points and 10
rebounds per game this season.

R. Kelly drops'Panties'

NICHOLAS WILLIAMS/Daily
University students Rowan Niemisto, Ian Klipa and Conor Anderson released their first album as Yada Yada this month.
Yada Yada e rgs'
with 'Daisy Chai n

By JACKSON HOWARD
DailyArts Writer
On the standard edition cover
of his most recent album, Black
Panties, R. Kelly, wearing a
"Phantom of
the Opera"
mask, plays an
almost naked Black Panties
woman like R.Kelly
a violin. It's a
fitting cover, RCA
considering
that maybe
no other artist in the history of
popular music has dedicated
the entirety of his or her work to
worshiping the female form and
everythingthat comes with it. For,
his past two albums, 2010's Love
Letter and 2012's Write Me Back,
however, Kelly ditched his sex-
riddled lyrics and sang in a tradi-
tional R&B form, malting music
more appropriate for a romantic
and smoky 1960s jazz joint than
a strip club in his native Chicago.
That being said, while both
albums were well received by
critics, Kelly's original fan base
quietly clamored for the real R.
Kelly, the self-professed "Pied
Piper of R&B" who, on "Etcet-
era" off of 1998's R., once begged
his lover to hit the IHOP with
him after a night of love making.
R. Kelly has sold over 54 million
records worldwide, been nomi-
nated for 24 Grammys and has a
voice second to none, but - just as
importantly - he has also created,
defined and perfected a truly vul-
gar, incredible and addictive form
of bedroom music that is unlike
any other released ,in the history
of R&B and pop music.
Black Panties, friends, is the
return of the R. Kelly who has
been missing for the past four
years. It doesn't matter that he's
46 years old or coming off vocal
chord surgery. Nothing matters
when you're R. Kelly and you're
including an actual pair of black
panties in the pre-order of your
new album. This man was meant
to singsex music, and respectabil-
ity be damned, he's goingto do it.
The album begins with two
songs dedicated to cunnilingus -
because how else should an album
called Black Panties start? "Do it
'til ya legs shakin', " Kelly sings on
the chopped-and-screwed opener
while Ludacris holds nothing

Ann Arbor-based
band finds its voice
on debut album
By JACKSON HOWARD
DailyArts Writer
Before local band Yada Yada
was Yada Yada, they were Del
Monte and the Drifters. And
when that didn't work out, they
turned to Popliteal Fossa, bet-
ter known as the back part of
the knee. Not surprisingly, that
didn't really catch on either. "No
one knew how to pronounce it.
Or spell it. Or say it," said drum-
mer Ian Klipa, a junior in the
School of Art & Design, laugh-
ing. "Not good for promotion."
The group finally settled
on Yada Yada, and on Dec. 1,
the band - consisting of LSA
juniors Rowan Niemisto, Conor
Anderson and Klipa - released
their debut album Daisy Chain, a
summery and contemplative col-
lection of 10 songs that has been
in the works for around eight
months.
Watching the three of them
interact with one another in the
house they share together in
Kerrytown, it's almost unfath-
omable to think that they only
met each other during their
freshman year living together
in Bursley Residence Hall. They
finish each other's sentences,
laugh at the same jokes and
clearly understand one another
on a deeply personal level. The
creative, process behind Daisy
Chain reflects their closeness.
"There's no song that's strict-
ly one person," Niemisto said,
who plays guitar and sings most
of the lead vocals, with Ander-
son adding, "Even if we just have

a riff, we run it by each other."
Coming from Marquette,
Mich., Anderson grew up attend-
ing a local folk festival where he
was drawn to roots folk and tra-
ditional fiddle music. In middle
school, Anderson, the band's
bass player and occasional lead
vocalist, was part of what he calls
"basically a Nirvana cover band."
"I've always been making music
and (Yada Yada) is just a progres-
sion," he said.
Luckily for the group, Niem-
isto's father is a musician and has
a home studio where Daisy Chain
was recorded. It was a learn-
ing process for the band, as they
were responsible for everything
having to do with the album out-
side of mixing it, from setting
up the microphones to arrang-
ing the music. None of the guys
are actually music majors, and
they had to find the right balance
between focusing on music and
school, though living together in
one house - where the majority
of the writing took place - cer-
tainly helped.
Still, the process wasn't all
that stressful. "We all do our
schoolwork and we take it seri-
ously because we all love our
classes" Klipa, who grew up in
Pittsburgh, said. "Music for us
is the fun thing, a relaxing thing.
It's not stressful writing the
songs because there's no dead-
line. Nobody asked us to put an
album out."
The fact that nobody asked
makes Daisy Chain's existence
even more impressive. Just
through one listen, it's more than
clear that significant time and
energy was invested in the proj-
ect - despite, its hiccups. The
lyrics are thoughtful. The sound
quality is professional. There are
trumpet parts (on "Fossa" and

"Three Ghosts"), narratives (on
"Spaceship Toothpick") and no
lack of extended instrumental
breakdowns. Yada Yada maybe
isn't ready to debut on a larger,
commercial scale just yet, but for
three college students making
music on the side, it's an admi-
rable accomplishment.
"Sun Breaks," the fourth
track, is a highlight of the
album. "I remember we did that
song right about when it was
turning from winter to sum-
mer," Anderson said, and, with
its sun-tinged guitars, longing
vocals and oscillating dynamics,
it certainly recalls the change
from dark to light, especially in
a state where the weather can
range from apocalyptic to sub-
lime. "We were very happy in
the summer," Niemisto said.
With Niemisto going abroad
next semester, the band is going
on forced hiatus, and their plans
for next year aren't necessar-
ily clear. Nonetheless, this past
Saturday, Yada Yada beat out
four other groups to win the
University's 3rd Annual Battle
of the Bands, while Daisy Chain
recently passed the 100 down-
loads mark on Bandcamp, an
online platform for artist pro-
motion.
Soon, the members of Yada
Yada will have to figure out
their path after college and
ultimately venture into a world
outside the confines of Ann
Arbor. But until that happens,
they're more than content - as
they should be - with writing
songs in their backyard, play-
ing shows in friends' houses
and, more than anything, liv-
ing life like any college student
should by waking up everyday
and doing something they truly
love.

Childish shows off dark side

ByADAM THIESEN
DailyArts Writer
Donald Glover is not supposed
to make a record like this. The
rapper-actor-comedian who goes
by the stage
name Child- B-
ish Gambino
has proven Because the
himself comi- nemet
cally on the
sitcom "Com- Childish
munity" Gambino
and talented
enough to Glassnote
pull off joke-
heavy charis-
matic rap songs, but Because the
Internet is a stylistic departure
from all of his previous work.
The album sounds like more of a
therapy session than any attempt
at commercial success and, while
intriguing at times, it's bound to
alienate the majority of Gambi-
no's fans.
Because the Internet begins
innocently enough with "Crawl,"
the album's second track,
which shows off some dark and
chopped-up, dubstep-influenced
production tricks, but still fea-
tures confident and clever verses
from Gambino. However, the
record quickly drops completely
out of the mainstream. Not only
are Gambino's beats experi-
mental, but he also plays around
with plenty of flows and voices.
- going from disinterested and
laid-back to tough-guy posturing
to syrupy singing, often within a
single track. It'll be up to his fans
to decide if this short-attention-
span style is idiosyncratic or just
plain weird.
Calling Because the Internet

begin to explain what it's trying
to be. Songs like "Sweatpants"

are perfect arenas for Gambino's though, and encouraging
ly;ical dexterity and cleverness, enough to foretella more refined

screams of contractual obli-

doesn't reinvent herself, but
even more disappointingly, the
album doesn't even play to her
strengths. Isolated moments
hint at Spears's prowess, but
none offer the sexiness, art-
istry or longevity of some of her
past power singles. A decade
after my first listen, "Toxic"
still gives me an intoxicating
rush. Listening to the entirety
of Britney Jean, however, feels
like waiting for a sneeze that

requirements necessary for
club-readiness.
The pre-released "Work
Bitch" and "Perfume," as well
as the leaked "Alien," satisfy
- but pop shouldn't satisfy; it
should. thrill. Britney Jean's
only thrilling track is also its
most bizarre: a campy, dis-
sonant duet between Brit and
younger sister Jamie Lynn
called "Chillin' With You" that
haphazardly stitches together
metallic trance with sugary
guitar sounds. It's so weird it

works, a genreless enigma. And
hey, weirdness iswelcome on an
album that all too often bores.
And if nothing else, it at least
informs us that Britney's more
of a red wine gal and Jamie's
more of a white.
What has always drawn me
to Britney Spears's music is its
escapism, the delirious, dream-
like seduction that bleeds
through most of her work (and
she epitomizes on 2007's Black-
out). Britney Jean fails to awak-
en that ecstasy within me. If I
can listen to a whole Britney
album and resist jumping to my
feet to dance, there's something
very, very wrong.
