ADMINISTRATION
'U' appoints
first shared
services ctr.
director

Pamela Gabel to
head 275-person
staff after location
opens in August
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily Staff Reporter
On Thursday, the University
appointed an executive director
to run the Shared Services Center
that will consolidate some Uni-
versity support staff into a central
location near Wolverine Tower.
The center is part of the Uni-
versity's larger Administrative
Services Transformation, a cost
containment measure aiming to
save $120 million from fiscal years
2013 to 2017.
Pamela Gabel, current director
of My Service Center, a division of
the building supplier Masco Cor-
poration that employees 15,000
people, will head the 275-person
staff at the shared services center
when it opens in August. She will
begin her role on April 28.
Al Franzblau, vice provost for
academic and budgetary affairs,

said in a University press release
that over 70 applicants were con-
sidered for the job. He added that
the search and selection processes
included faculty and staff feed-
back.
"Our selection process includ-
ed bringing finalists to campus
to make presentations and take
questions from audiences that
included staff from the project
team, administrators from aca-
demic units and central offices,
faculty members and some of the
future staff members of the Shared
Services Center," Franzblau said.
"Their collective guidance was
very important to the final selec-
tion of our service center's leader."
The Shared Services Center is
slated to open in August with a
small number of staff. The center
will be fully staffed and at opera-
tional capacity by winter 2015.
Over the course of the center's
planning period, there has been
significant controversy regarding
its implementation. In November
and December, staff and faculty
spoke outcstrongly against the Uni-
versity's handling of the project. A
petition that circulated the faculty

MUSIC Matters
presents largest
installment of
annual event
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
In the third installment of its
annual SpringFest celebration,
MUSIC Matters pulled out all
the stops Thursday.

Rain served as an enforced
recess between the afternoon's
activities and the night's cap-
stone concert - which cli-
maxed as rapper 2 Chainz
strolled onto the Hill Audito-
rium stage, bellowinghis moni-
ker to the heavens.
During the day, food
trucks and live entertainment
stretched along North Uni-
versity Avenue from Hatcher
Graduate Library to North Uni-
versity Avenue, while 40 stu-
dent organizations, organized

by themed tents, presented
their year's work. Lasting from
11 a.m. to 6 p.m., the festivities
built up to 2 Chainz: the day's
headlining act.
After his performance, 2
Chainz explained in an inter-
view how he connects to a
diverse set of audiences.
"I just think I'm very trans-
parent," he said. "What you see
is what you get. I'm like this
on and off camera - at home,
chillin' out. I've got a good spir-
it. I'm very blessed and I think

that kind of projects to the
crowd. It's organic. People like
it and I appreciate it."
LSA senior Phil Schermer,
MUSIC Matters president, said
SpringFest as a whole - which
was revamped to resemble

"My phone was dead for 45

The University is currently

Edwards Brothers Malloy prop-

Ann Arbor's Planning Commis-

Students, local

By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Robots invaded campus
Thursday when government
agencies, businesses and stu-
dents showcased the latest in
robotic and automated vehicle
innovations at adaylongshow-
case for the fourth annual
Robotics Day.
The event highlighted
local advancements in robot-
ics with demonstrations by
students from the College
of Engineering, local high
schools and representatives
from local businesses. The
conference also featured panel

discussions on topics ranging
from the commercial applica-
tions for drones to the future
of robots in aiding health and
rehabilitation.
Many small businesses
showcased their latest prod-
ucts, including Cybernet Sys-
tems Corporation, an Ann
Arbor business that invented
today's fastest selling robotic
consumer technology, and
SkySpecs, an Ann Arbor
drone-making operation.
Though the event placed
an emphasis on private inno-
vation, it did not ignore the
role that government agencies
have played in the develop-
ment of robotic technology.
In a speech at the event,
state Rep. Gretchen Driskell
(D-Saline) recognized the
state's involvement in develop-
ing robotics at the University
and establishing a partnership
between industry and the gov-

ernment.
Dawn Tilbury, associate
dean for research and gradu-
ate education at the College
of Engineering, said the Uni-
versity frequently combines
public and private funding to
launch research projects.
She said 75 percent of Col-
lege of Engineering research
is funded by federal and state
governments and businesses
contribute a fraction of the
overall budget as well.
"Sometimes you can't get
the money just from the Uni-
versity, you need to partner
with industry to get the fed-
eral funds," Tilbury said. "It's
complicated, but alot of times
those projects are very suc-
cessful in transferring the
results of the research into
industry because you're part-
nering with the company right
up front."

Rebecca Blank
offers her stance on
opportunity gaps
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
The national discussion on
income inequality reached
campus Thursday afternoon as
Rebecca Blank, chancellor of
University of Wisconsin-Mad-
ison, gave her interpretation of
the disparity of opportunity in
the United States.
Before her role as chancellor at
Wisconsin, Blank served as dean
and professor ofpublic policy and
economics in the Gerald Ford
School of Public Policy from 1998
to 2008 and as Deputy Secretary
and Acting Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
She spoke in Rackham Audi-
torium to a crowd of Public Pol-
icy undergraduate and graduate
students, faculty and commu-
nity members. Blank opened her
lecture by challenging common
perceptions about American
opportunity in the United States.
"New starts may be hard,
but not impossible," Blank said.
"Opportunity for those at the
very bottom maybe very limited,
hard work may not lead to eco-
nomic advancement and it turns
out, not everyone can be presi-
dent or CEO."
She discussed how, in the
developing world competition
with other countries, technologi-

cal advances and the entrance
of women into the workforce all
have contributed to the rising
inequality. However, she said
because these factors have also
played apositive rolein economic
advancement, eliminating them
would not reduce inequality.
"Many of the causes of ris-
ing inequality are not clearly
negative," she said. "In fact, not
just the people in this room, but
many lower- and middle-income
families as well, have benefitted
enormously from the very forces
that also caused some of this ris-
ing inequality."
Effects of inequality such
as residential segregation by
income, family composition and
disparities in enrichment expen-
ditures on children were also dis-
cussed.
While she suggested legis-
lative solutions that would be
effective - such as wealth redis-
tribution and better education
funding - Blank was pessimistic
about any short-term progress,
pointing to the political gridlock
in Washington.
Public Policy graduate student
Mo Torres said he attended the
event because inequality is one
of the biggest policy issues the
United States is currently facing.
"At the University, we talk
about how after we graduate
we'll have all of these opportu-
nities," Torres said. "We forget
that a lot of people don't have the
opportunities that, as students,
we've had. If we don't care about

Violent clashes in
Central African
Republic prompt
military response
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.N. Security Council on
Thursdayunanimouslyapproved
a nearly 12,000-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force for Central
African Republic, where mount-
ing violence between Christians
and Muslims has brought kill-
ings, torture and sexual violence.
The 10,000 U.N. troops and
1,800 police will take over from
5,000 African Union soldiers -
but not until Sept. 15. A separate
2,000-strong French force in the
Central African Republic was
authorized to use "all necessary
means" to support the new U.N.
force.
How much protection U.N.
troops will be able to offer is an
open question. Keeping civil-
ians safe throughout the Cen-
tral African Republic, especially
in rural areas, is already prov-
ing a difficult, if not impossible,

task. The country is the size of
Texas, many roads have not been
repaved since independence
from France in 1960, and many
of the people escaping violence
have fled into the bush.
The country has been in chaos
since a March 2013 coup, when
mostly Muslim rebels seized
power and set up a brutal regime.
Christian militiamen attacked
rebel strongholds in early
December. As the rebel govern-
ment crumbled in January, the
Christian militiamen stepped
up the violence, forcing tens of
thousands of Muslims to flee.
On the streets of the Central
African Republic's capital, Ban-
gui, reactions to the U.N. deploy-
ment were muted.
Cyrius Zemangui-Kette, 25,
who is unemployed, said U.N.
troops should have been sent in
long ago, but the international
community dragged its feet and
now things have gotten worse.
"They say they'll arrive in Sep-
tember," he said. "Until then, lots
of Central Africans will continue
to die, so who are they coming to
save?"
Muslim and Christian leaders

in Central African Republic wel-
comed the U.N. deployment but
urged immediate support to the
African force.
"Ethnic cleansing is rife
and the lives of thousands are
at risk," Archbishop of Ban-
gui Dieudonn6 Nzapalainga
warned.
Imam Omar Kobine Laya-
ma, the country's most senior
Muslim leader, said this week's
commemoration of the 1994
Rwanda genocide "is an impor-
tant reminder of the risks that
our country faces" and said
the U.N. force must be part of
"a long-term strategy to bring
peace to our country."
Clashes between Christian
and Muslim fighters in the cen-
tral town of Dekoa that began
Tuesday have left at least 30
people dead, a priest said Thurs-
day. Most of the victims were
civilians, killed by Muslims who
fired into a crowd of people they
mistook for Christian militants,
Father Everaldo De Suza of the
Saint Anne parish said. A Chris-
tian commander confirmed the
fighting but denied that his forc-
es had started it.

treatment of

unconstitutional
A federal judge has ruled that

In the ruling issued Thursday,
U.S. District Court Judge Law-

updated policies on the use of
both methods but did not ban
them.
Karlton gave the department a

University does not have to pay
taxes to the city of Ann Arbor
and has autonomy from the city.
The city has always had
somewhat of a tense relation-
ship with the University due to
this polarizing reality, and since
the University does not have to
play by the city's rules or pay
taxes as an autonomous unit,
city officials' suggestions to the
University often fall on what
they say are selectively deaf
ears.
Monday's resolution spe-
cifically urges the University to
consider selling small parcels
of the land for "complementary
uses," and asks that the Univer-
sity reflect on the idea of creat-
ing a possible "pedestrian and
vehicular" connection between
South Main and South State in
harmony with the Oakbrook

Jim Kosteva, the Univer-
sity's director for community
relations, said in an e-mail the
University plans to use the

infrastructure.
Kosteva reiterated that the

"We are always prepared to

wrote. "We have already com-
municated our willingness to
meet with city officials regard-
ing their specific interests
expressed in the resolution."
Councilmember Sabra Briere,
while noting that she does not
harbor any bitterness towards
the University, also said while
University officials do engage in
talks with city officials, the Uni-
versity almost always does what
is best for itself and not neces-
sarily for the city.
"They always sit down, but
it's notto negotiate," Briere said.
Still, Briere said she does not
expect the University to fully
comply with the city's resolu-
tion. Briere has been in conver-

her though the University would
not satisfy all suggestions, they
would make some concessions.
"He said of course they aren't
going to do any retail develop-
ment close to the sidewalk or

with specific unit expertise.
"Faculty members in par-
ticular have told us they don't
want to lose the nuanced knowl-
edge of unit staff, and this is an
important part of our planning
process going forward," Mad-

things that would make the
pedestrian experience for walk-
ing along there better," Briere
said. "Although they might
improve the sidewalk, what they
really promised to do is keep the
commuter lot open."
However, Briere also said she
was told the University might
consider the Oakbrook con-
nector between North Main
Street and South State Street for
pedestrian and bicycle passage,
which she said would be a great
thing for the city's residents.
She added that she hopes one
day the University sees that also
considering the city's interests
is mutually beneficial.
"It's unfortunate that the
tension exists between the city
and the University," Briere said.
"Designing to help Ann Arbor to
be abetter community is to their
benefit."
Over the past year, the city
and the University have had
similar encounters. On Nov. 7,
the City Council formally asked
the University to take down
the new marquee board that
was erected in front of the Big
House. Some city councilmem-
bers had fears that the board
was distracting to drivers, but
the University did not budge.

ROBOTICS
From Page 1
The National Center for Manu-
facturing Sciences, a non-profit
organization that fosters collab-
orations between businesses,
government and researchers, co-
hosted the event with the College
of Engineering.
NCMS director Phil Callihan
said the role government plays
in partnering with businesses is
not solely to advance innovation,
but to ensure industry continues
to produce innovative products
within the country. He said fed-
eral and,, state governments are

looking closely at robotics innova-
tion in Michigan - a budding hub
for the field - to create local jobs
and restore the weak economy.
Callihan added that govern-
ment and business involvement in
the University's robotics program
will increase in the coming years
thanks to the "fertile" environ-
ment for innovation in the area.
"When we're talking aboutthis
kind of robotic innovation and
autonomous vehicle innovation,
they're not waiting for us," he
said. "Innovation will march for-
ward. We need to make sure we're
doing everything we can to drive
industry and to allow the work to
happen that will help that grow."


INEQUALITY

the people that are not at the Uni-
versity, then the people who are
in power won't do a whole lot to
make the world more equal."
Public Policy graduate student
Gillean Kitchen said inequality is
an issue that all people face but
not everyone is willing to talk
about.
"I think inequality has an
impact on the overall economy,
on the opportunities that we have

available tous and the.opportuni-
ties that will be available to our
future kids, and if we don't care
about it nobody else is going to,"
Kitchen said. "We're potentially
future leaders, so if we truly take
that to heart this is one of the big-
gest challenges facing our nation
today."
The inequality discussion will
continue this week at the Public
Policy School and the National
Poverty Center Friday with an
academic conference in honor
of The Research and Training
Program on Poverty and Public
Policy.

SPRINGFEST
From Page 1
SpringFest. It's unbelievable."
Schermer said the festi-
val's new layout, which aimed
to both inspire and showcase
student accomplishment, set
a strong precedent for future
improvement. He said he hopes
that MUSIC Matters will
recruit more student organiza-
tions to present next year, in
addition to bringing in more
fooddoptions and more live out-
door concerts.
One of Thursday's live per-
formers was LSA sophomore
Sylvia Yacoub, who was for-
merly a top 10 contestant on
the third season of NBC's "The
Voice." She said the venue gave
her a chance to cater to a local
audience, which she appreci-
ated.
"I thought it was a lot of fun,"
she said. "The crowd was awe-
some. I loved the energy ... It
was really cool to just perform
with students. It's the demo-
graphic, essentially, that I want
to jump to when I release my
album sometime this year."
Yacoub performed a roughly
10-song set that included covers
of Jessie J., Christina Aguilera
and Rihanna. She also sang a
slow, acoustic version of Tay-
lor Swift's "I Knew You Were
Trouble."
Musical acts like Yacoub's
were intertwined with entre-
preneurial-themed talks
throughout the day. University
alum Mike Muse, one of the
nation's top political fundrais-
ers and the co-founder of record
label Muse Recordings, deliv-
ered one of these presentations.
In his speech to students,
Muse emphasized the close ties
between music and politics -
both mechanisms of enacting
change.
"We're here about SpringFest
and we're here about 2 Chainz
are we're here for MUSIC Mat-
ters, but really, what is the
purpose for us being here?" he
asked during his talk. "The pur-
pose is engagement. The pur-
pose is activism. The purpose
is to build community. The pur-
pose is to bust down the segre-
gated walls that we have here on
this campus."
Muse has also been named
the first director of MUSIC Mat-
ters' future board, which he said
will ultimately consist of profes-
sionals who "have ties to both
the intersection of pop culture
and change agents." This group
will work with outside sources
to help fund and build MUSIC
Matters in the coming years.
Muse said he became
involved with MUSIC Matters

after Schermer reached out to
him earlier inthe year, as he was
impressed with the similarities
between his work and that of
the student organization.
"I was using music to make
fundraising fun, and to make it
cool, and to make it inviting, and
to break the ice and say, 'This is
what politics looks like now,"'"he
said, adding that his career and
MUSIC Matters "share a very
unique symbiotic relationship
that runs parallel."
On a similar tangent of devel-
opment, MPowered hosted an
event called MTank - mod-
eled after ABC's "Shark Tank,"
where start-up entrepreneurs
pitch their potential products
to world-renowned business
moguls.
Five groups pitched their
products to a board of local ven-
ture capitalists, and ultimately a
product called "S-Pack"won the
contest.
According to a handout dis-
tributed by MPowered prior
to the MTank, S-Pack works
to "solve the problem every
woman faces by combining sev-
eral essential toiletries into one
product small enough to fit in
any woman's purse."
Business sophomore Mariel
Reiss presented the product,
which she said targeted college-
aged women who might need
to freshen up following a night
on the town or even a drunken
hookup.
Engineering junior Chris
O'Neil, MPowered president,
credited SpringFest for provid-
ing entrepreneurship with a
wider audience.
"I'm kind of stuck in the
entrepreneurship end of this
university, and I think that
SpringFest was a really unique
opportunity to have an event
that had a little higher enter-
tainment value - so you have
these people who maybe aren't
as familiar with entrepreneur-
ship get to see what is going on
and see all the cool startups and
ideas that are actually happen-
ing on campus," he said.
Tom Frank, executive direc-
tor of the University's Center for
Entrepreneurship, said there is
no longer a "normal" entrepre-
neurship crowd.
"I think that it's more about
people who have innovative
ideas; that they're becoming
less and less shy about sharing
with an audience, as opposed to
something thinking of an entre-
preneur as somebody locked in
a room who's going to build and
invent something that suddenly
gets released on the world," he
said. "They make it more collab-
orative, more open and a safer
environment to let those ideas
cross-pollinate."

This "cross-pollination"
of thought Thursday was not
restricted to entrepreneur-
ship. Schermer said the Identity
tent, located directly outside of
Hatcher Graduate Library, was
also a large factor in the trading
new ideas.
The Black Student Union pre-
sented a photography exhibit in
the tent as a culmination of the
#BBUM movement. LSA senior
Tyrell Collier, outgoing BSU
speaker, said the pictures were
meant to explore the experience
of Black students at the Uni-
versity in a new medium. The
photo-shoot largely took place
primarily in an alleyway off of
E. Liberty Street.
"We just wanted to show -
because the environment that
we shot in was a rough environ-
ment; there was trash, dump-
sters, some bricks - we really
just wanted to get across the
beauty in blackness, even in the
roughest environments," Collier
said.
Despite 20 mph winds, Col-
lier said the extreme weather
did not impede the project's
success.
"We were placed right on the
Diag proper," he said. "So there
was a lot of traffic. Even just stu-
dents going to class - there was
a lot of traffic flowing through
our tent. I don't think it's every
day that you see a tent with
about 24 different pictures of
Black people."
University alum Jeff
Sorensen, a co-founder of social
innovation group optiMize,
also commented on the event's
success in showcasing student
accomplishment.
Though optiMize had been
planning to host a dunk tank
featuring "well-known" stu-
dents on campus - including
CSG representatives and stu-
dent athletes - these efforts
were halted early in the day by
the University's Risk Manage-
ment Services, Sorensen said.
However, he added, opti-
Mize was most successful with
its whiteboards, on which buzz
words like "diversity," "health"
and "education" were writ-
ten and students were asked to
write down what those terms
meant to them. Sorensen said
optiMize received several hun-
dred responses, all of which are
now displayed in the Center for
Entrepreneurship.
Sorensen also lauded the
work of optiMize finalists, who
presented their innovative proj-
ects throughout the day.
As for the future of Spring-
Fest, Schermer said the best is
yet to come.
"I think it's going to be so
much bigger and better than it
was this year," he said.

Sylvia Mathews
Burwell to fill Health
and Human Services
Secretary role
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Embattled Health and Human
Services Secretary Kathleen
Sebelius is resigning as the
White House seeks to move past
the election-year political dam-
age inflicted by the rocky rollout
of President Barack Obama's sig-
nature health care law.
Sebelius' resignation comes
just over a week after sign-ups
closed for the first year of insur-
ance coverage under the so-called
Obamacare law. The opening
weeks of the enrollment period
were marred by widespread web-
site woes, though the adminis-
tration rebounded strongly by
enrolling 7.1 million people by the
March 31 deadline, exceeding ini-
tial expectations. Enrollment has
since risen to 7.5 million as people
were given extra time tocomplete
applications.
Even with the late surge
in sign-ups, the law remains
unpopular with many Ameri-
cans and Republicans have made
it a centerpiece of their efforts to
retake the Senate in the fall.
Sebelius' resignation could
also set the stage for a conten-
tious confirmation hearing to
replace her. In a sign that the
White House is seeking to avoid
a nomination fight, the president
was tapping Sylvia Mathews

Burwell, the director of the
Office of Management and Bud-
get, to replace Sebelius. Burwell
was unanimously confirmed by
the Senate for her current post.
A White House official
requested anonymity to confirm
Sebelius' resignation and Bur-
well's nomination ahead of the
formal announcement. Obama
has not nominated anyone to
replace Burwell as budget direc-
tor.
Obama remained publicly
supportive of Sebelius through-
ott the rough rollout, deflecting
Republican calls for her resigna-
tion. But she was conspicuously
not standing by his side last week
when he heralded the sign-up
surge during an event in the
White House Rose Garden.
The official said the 65-year-
old Sebelius approached Obama
last month about stepping down,
telling him that the sign-up
deadline was a good opportunity
for a transition and suggesting he
would be better served by some-
one who was less of a political
target.
A spokeswoman for Sen. Pat
Roberts, a Republican from
Sebelius' home state of Kansas,
called the resignation "a prudent
decision" given what she called
the total failure of Obamacare
implementation.
Sebelius dropped no hints
about her resignation Thursday
when she testified at a budget
hearing. Instead, she received
congratulations from Demo-
cratic senators on the sign-up
surge.

Celebrating mental wellness
The University should help CAPS expand its event offerings
Monday, the Michigan Theater hosted the concert, "We Can
All Change the Story: A Celebration of Hope." The suicide-
prevention awareness showcase was the product of significant
planning and collaboration between the Counseling and Psychological
Services Student Advisory board and the Central Student Government.
The event provided wristbands and free pizza while promoting an end
for student suicide on campus and informing students of the services
available to them. It also featured several prominent speakers who talked
about their own experiences with mental illnesses. CAPS has helped
make a positive change in the community and encouraged discussion of a
difficult topic with this event. The University should continue to promote
and strengthen CAPS events in order to maximize their ability to affect

Sorry to burst your bubble

The other day, I was called
"pretentious" by one of my
students. He's a great kid,
and usually
pretty polite, so
I wasn't offended
by the comment
so much as
taken aback.
(The comment
came absolutely
out of nowhere.
It seemed as KATIE
natural to him asSTEEN
commenting on
the weather.)
"Pretentious?" I said, feeling
suddenly flustered. "No I'm not!
What! Pretentious?"
"It's not necessarily a bad thing,"
he said. "Come on," he nodded his
head as if we were both in on a little
secret. "This is Ann Arbor. We're all a
little pretentious here."
I still don't think he knows
the meaning of pretentious (for
instance, he asked me if I listen to
Neutral Milk Hotel in attempt to
prove his point). But his comment
stuck with me - "This is Ann
Arbor." what did he mean by that?
I've felt simultaneously
frustrated and in love with Ann
Arbor for some time now, not
because there's anything blatantly
wrong with it - quite the contrary,
because it's just so good. Too
good. Too cute. Too green. Too
locally-made. Too grassroots. Too
academic. Too "politically correct."
Too leaders and the best. Too
proud. Too active, too passionate,
too happy. We really do have it all
in this little college bubble. Except,
it's not ... real.
Ann Arbor isn't flawless - hell, I
complain about Ann Arbor biweekly

in this column. Just like pretty much
everywhere else in the world, Ann
Arbor has problems with sexism and
rape culture and all the other shit I
write about pretty much nonstop.
But at the same time, Ann Arbor is
somewhat of a liberal haven - a place
many young twenty-somethings
wish they (we) could hold onto
forever. And maybe we can. There
are lots of bubbles in the U.S. and
in the world. I myself have lived my
whole life in a series of bubbles -
sometimes one inside another.
I grew up in Grosse Pointe, a more
conservative-minded bubble I never
quit fit in, but a safe, beautiful little
bubble with a lake nonetheless. (It's
a bubble with strong, fear-based
walls, I might add - both figurative
and literal walls, like the one built
out of snow this winter on Kercheval
Avenue, cutting off GP from Detroit.
Then I moved to South Quad in
Ann Arbor - a nine-story bubble
where I was surrounded by a bunch
of socially awkward nerds like
myself and fattened on a cushy meal
plan. Scattered around the halls
were advertisements for all sorts of
cultural events, posters advocating
for depression awareness and
notifications of "bias incidents" that
occurred in the dorm. Overseeing
everything was our benevolent R.A.,
a sweet girl with an affinity for
Bananagrams.
After South Quad came the
co-ops, where we have regular
meetings in which we're encouraged
to feel "empowered" to speak our
opinion, where we can have SAPAC
and IGR come to our living room
and lead discussions and workshops.
"Safe space" is something of a
buzzword here.
And currently, I'm student

teaching at a high school that my field
instructor likes to call "magic high
school." It's a small community of
kids - many of them professors' kids,
I've begun to realize, and many of
whom are intimidatingly passionate
- about learning, about social justice,
about expressing their identities,
their creativity, about finding what
it is they care about in the world and
jumping in head first.
We all have our bubbles. But most
of us, at some point will leave the
safety and comfort of our bubbles
- for many of us, our exit is coming
sooner than later (May 3, actually).
And that, I think, is for the better.
The unfortunate truth is, the
world isn't safe, and it's not a bubble
- it's a hungry beast that you can
battle or avoid behind closed doors.
We can create little bubbles of our
ideal realities, but they are not
the norm.
Many of the people reading
this article will be graduating and
moving out of good ol' A-squared
at some point, and you're probably
going to feel at least a little lonely
and unprepared and scared. "Real
Life" will finally arrive, and it will
probably seem kind of shitty at
first compared to your last four
years. But I'm asking you to take
everything you've learned in your
college years and beyond, and apply
it to Real Life - to make Real Life
a better world for everyone. Don't
feel afraid when you leave your safe
space; feel empowered. We all have
our beasts to battle, our-isms and
our anxieties. Don't shut them out
- go after them.
P.S. I'm not pretentious!

change and reach out to students.
CAPS shouldbecommendedforhostingthis
event, as should CSG for its support. Together
they created a showcase that addressed and
raised awareness for a challenging subject that
is a serious issue both on campus and around
the world. The University has the potential to
be a stressful environment for many students,
which worsens the problem of mental health
issues. Stress and anxiety can cause and
perpetuate mental health issues and lead to
suicide. A study conducted by the American
Public Health Association, which was based
on data from 157 colleges, found that suicide
accounts for 6.18 deaths in 100,000 college
students, which is higher than the amount
alcohol-related deaths - 4.86 deaths per
100,000 college students. A study from the
American Psychological Association found
that 15 percent of graduate and 18 percent
of undergraduate students have seriously
contemplated suicide in their lifetimes.
It's clear that suicide is a major problem
around collegecampuses, but the stigma around
the topic, as well as many other mental health
topics,makes seekinghelp and creatingdialogue
a problem. Events such as "A Celebration of
Hope" help to break the stigma and promote
discussion, and are thus critical to the goal
of having students seek help. Students can
receive help at CAPS, as it provides confidential
psychological and psychiatric services for
enrolled graduate and undergraduate students
at the University. Some of their services include
individual counseling, group opportunities,
urgent/crisis services, psychiatric evaluations
and medication management, and screenings
and support for ADHD, eating patterns and

substance abuse. In addition, CAPS is involved
in outreach and education and works to battle
mental health issues in many different ways.
This event in particular was focused on suicide
prevention, but their efforts promote mental
health wellness in general. The importance of
such an organization on this campus can't be
emphasized enough.
The showcase was developed and executed
in an effective way that helped to address the
social stigma that surrounds mental disorders
and make students less intimidated to seek help
from CAPS. Their use of high profile speakers
such as former Michigan football player Will
Heininger, Miss Michigan Haley Williams and
radio host John Bommarito was an important
way to break the barriers of the stigma around
suicide and mental disorders because they
talked about how mental health issues have
affected their lives. Having prominent and
successful people discuss their experience with
mental disorders helps normalize the issue.
It's the responsibility of the University to
promote, fund and support CAPS in its efforts
to improve mental health wellness. The more
events, and the more transparent and accessible
to students these events are, the more power
CAPS has to break social stigmas and address
issues surrounding mental issues.
"We Can All Change the Story: A Celebration
of Hope" was a successful event engineered by
CSG and CAPS that worked to promote an end
for suicide on campus and educated students
about the services available to them. However,
the University should make more events like
this possible by increasing their support and
funding for CAPS.

It is truly interesting to observe
the differences that characterize the
approaches to doctoral research in
politics in America and Britain. To
begin with, while the former perceives
the readiness to argue, challenge,
debate and offer contrasting
standpoints as an opportunity to
deepen academic links, the latter is
very careful about such aspects of
academic upbringing as if they could
eventually generate animosity. Of
course, it should be noted that on
various occasions, the American idea
about freedom of the academic mind
could easily lead to Q&A sessions that
have nothingto do with the presented
topics. But, this is still less worrisome,
as sometimes-irrelevantquestions can
serve as a basis for some new, relevant
ones. Thus, while British approach
can teach us to be more judgmental
about the speaker and their talk,
American approach can teach us to be
more creative and flexible vis-A-vis the
academic scholarship.
Flexibility of mind and options,
in general, can also be problematic,
especially when thinking about
practical issues: it is generally much
quicker (not necessarily easier, as
sometimes imagined) to obtain a
Ph.D in the UK than in the US. While
American graduate students are
bombarded with all sorts of literature
and, more importantly, expected
to prove a detailed familiarity
with aspects of often-questionable
usefulness, UK doctoral candidates
are expected to know primarily
about aspects closely related to their
research puzzle (everything else
seems to be a luxury). But, this is what
doing a Ph.D is supposed to be, isn't
it? This kind of discrepancy can be
attributed to the overall approach to
doctoral studies as well as to the role
playedby advisors (US) or supervisors
(UK). In fact, it seems that even these
two words suggest two different roles:
whileinAmerica,theroleofanadvisor
is to advise doctoral students by
providing them with additional ideas,
numerous questions and possible
directions to consider, in Britain, the
role of a supervisor is to supervise,
meaning to guide and tell the students
what to do (in a polite way, of course)
and if not doing it the supervisor-
expected way, to correct them. This
somehow indicates that supervisors
are often expected to be experts

in the field (or at least the leading
supervisor), whereas advisors are not
- an important aspect suggesting
that advisors can also learn a lot from
their doctoral candidates. Such an
exchange of knowledge could lead to
joint publications - something that,
generally speaking, seems to happen
more often in the US than in the UK.
The advising approach is lesgthier
and usually a couple ofyeatsarmgone
before clear-cut research question(s)
and main argument(s) are established.
On the other hand,the Europeans tend
to have their research design before
theyeven apply for doctoral programs,
as applications are judged based on
the overall quality of the submitted
research proposal. The preparation
American doctoral students must go
through is intended to help them to
consolidate their arguments and often
to defend them in a more convincing
way (including conferences and
workshops where they present early
stagesoftheirresearch),whereastheir
European colleagues tend to modify
their originally presented proposals or
evencompletelyabandonthem.
withregardtotheresearchmethods
employed in most social science
areas, what seems quite striking is
the obsession with dependent and
independent variables and the power
of numbers and percentages amongst
American doctoral candidates. In fact,
it seems that it has become impossible
to present a good research prospectus
in the US without having the two
variables and some idea about what
they are likely to show. This could
haveto dowiththe whole post-Second
World War number mania when
polls, percentages and accompanying
predictions came to occupy an
important place in social sciences. In
May 2012, I was invited to serve as a
discussantattheWesternUSGraduate
Student Research Workshop on the
European Union, hosted by the EU
Center of Excellence at the University
of California at Berkeley, and I was
amazed to hear that every single
presentation had the two variables
and, in fact, proudly insisted on their
relevance. According to one of the
presented papers,numbers are enough
(sometimes 100 interviewees out of
over 500 million inhabitants of the
EU) to tell us how the Union exactly
works,how it is likely to respond to the
present and future crises, whether the
concept of European identity is a valid
one and so on. But, is it credible to say
that the two variables can explain
almost any EU-related research topic
or should the students be allowed to
be a bit more flexible when conducting
research? Perhaps, the issue is that
numbers - and, more relevantly,
percentages - have consolidated
their position really well, to the extent
that they are often used as the only
accurate source of information and
thus no junior researcher is really
willing to challenge their power.

"playing" with available resources,
peers and, most importantly, new

new, cutting-edge scholarship and
this is where the US seems to be ahead

from explaining some sectionsof the
rankings, this could probably explain
the US-based university presses' right
to be extremely picky when it comes to
scholarship they want to consider and
possibly publish. Another colleague of
mine has recently had the following
experience: after approaching an
American university press and
sending in the whole manuscript, a
set of constructive comments was
provided by the reviewers who said
that the submitted work was good
and that they themselves would be
very happy to use it and cite it, but still
required some (substantial) changes.
However, the publisher kept the right
to say and actually warnthe submitter
that even after all the changes have
been made, the reviewers might still
decide to reject the manuscript in
which case the whole process would
terminate there. Needless to say how
frustrating such a response for an
ambitious junior scholar mustbe!
As already noted, the rankings
show that the world's best
universities are mostly US-based.
Although we can argue that
rankings often tend to be defined by
parameters that should not really
matter to prospective researchers,
there are many aspects that cannot
be ignored and here I primarily refer
to the funding available to conduct
(post)graduate study in politics. In
this respect, Americans can afford
to finance their PhD candidates to
sit and go through both relevant and
irrelevant methods and scholarship,
whereas the UK-based researchers
are often conditioned by tight
deadlines to complete, submit and
defend their PhDs.Still,in both cases,
a good PhD is a finished PhD and it is
actually here where the real fight for
a permanent position in academia
begins. Indeed, the question of the
job market is the one that remains
the most pressing, both in the system
that rushes through and the one that
seems to be significantly slower.
Given the disappointing numbers of
new jobs in academia at the moment,
contrasted with the growing
numbers of available PhD holders,
one could potentially find it easier to
opt for a longer, American version of
conducting a doctoral study and thus
enjoy as many aspects of research as
possible. Some others would rather
do it the quick, British way, and then
consider all sorts of jobs, including
the idea that they will not be back in
academia at any time soon.

OKUS event to
celebrate the 'U'

Noname Gypsy and
Kopelliwill headline
annualblockparty
By GILLIAN JAKAB
Communityf£ Culture Editor
After completing their first
year at the University in 2003,
Alma E. Davilla-Toro and Atiba
T. Edwards
felt a need FOKUS
to splatter Anual
some color on
a somewhat Block Party
bland campus Saturdayat12
culture. There
had to be a p.m.-5p.m.
driving force to TheDag
bring together Free
diverse art
forms and
communities,
and thus FOKUS - "Fighting
Obstacles Knowing Ultimate
Success" - was born.
"Itwasstarted,inpart,because
U of M's campus was lacking
the hip-hop acts that Atiba and
Alma were used to, being from
New York City - being able to
go to a lot of urban art exhibits
and hip-hop (performances),"
said LSA Junior Elle Gover, the
Co-Vice President of FOKUS.
"They found that a lot of those
acts were going to Michigan
State and Eastern Michigan
University instead of U of M,
and so that was a huge thing in
founding FOKUS."
In its first year, FOKUS
brought performers such as
Janelle Monie, Slum Village and
John Legend to campus.
"We not only wanted to meet
the world's greatest emerging
artists, but also wanted to
introduce them to our worlds,"
Davilla-Toro recently wrote in a
message to the FOKUS Facebook
page. 4. ,
Though the group has been
highly successful with their
presentation of musical artists,
FOKUS events seek to shed light
on every conceivable genre of
marginalized art or cultural
activity.

"Every year we have an event
called 'Artifacts' which is a
showcasing of lesser known -
underrepresented in our opinion
- art," Gover explained. "We've
done food art, industrial art and
then this past fall we did tattoo
art; it was called 'Inked."'
With "Inked," FOKUS
engaged people from all over
campus and Ann Arbor to submit
tattoo designs and the stories
behindthem.Thefollowingpanel
discussion with tattoo artists
was further encouragement to
discover, reconsider and share.
"We are influencers, taste
makers, activists, and vanguards
who sought balance in our
everyday lives on campus,"
Davilla-Toro wrote. "We needed
a space where we could foster
this creativity that normally took
a backseat to the academically
rigorous university climate.
The goal was to design our own
avenue for change, so we came
together to educate, empower
and unite communities through
the arts!"
Creativity is infectious, and
with spring in the air the group
hopes to spread the FOKUS bug
(no, not the one that plagues us
as we study in the library) with
Vanguards, its annual block
party, this Saturday in the Diag
from 12 p.m. - 5 p.m.
In the past, Vanguards
has been shaped by different
themes. One year, the block
party was "circus" which played
with the idea of exploitation
and stereotype. Another year,
the Diag became a portal to
our childhood -'90s galore.
Saturday, however, forgoes a
concrete theme, and rather
embodies the history and
evolution of FOKUS.
"This year we went with
'Reflektl0ns' ... we're reflecting
in general on the last ten years;
.we'll have posters and other
(visuals) showing things that
have happened in the past
decade on campus, in our club
and worldwide," Gover said.
"It's a celebration of FOKUS
and celebration of being on this
campus."

The block party's headlining
performers are Noname Gypsy
- an artist who not only has
been admired among FOKUS
members as they've been playing
her music at meetings, but
recently by the larger campus
as well, who loved her music
when she opened for Chance the
Rapper at Hill Auditorium last
month - Detroit rapper Kopelli
and several other incredible
artists.
The day will be filled with
temporary tattoos, an interactive
chalkboard that prompts: "ten
years ago; in ten years," gigantic
bubbles and a 25 foot-long
sandwich all set to the backdrop
of a DJ and studded with
performances by the University's
Pure and Encore dance groups,
and this year's FOKUS Beat
Battle winner Jonah Gray.
Gover hopes to teach people
about FOKUS and its history;
she knows people often see the
eye-catching aesthetics of their
poster designs, but may still
wonder "what do they actually
do?" Most importantly, she hopes
everyone coming to Vanguards
just has a really great time.
"Our entire planning for this
particular Vanguards revolves
around making it a really fun
day for everyone involved -
introducing people to new
musical artists and to each
other."
With Davilla-Toro and
Edward's establishment of a
Brooklyn chapter upon their
graduation in 2006, FOKUS'
influences now spread far and
wide. It is important to celebrate
the University community that
fostered the group's growth and
who probably needs to charge
their solar panels and de-stress
before finals - what better way
than a block party?
"FOKUS awakened our souls
and taught us howto be curators
of life," Davilla-Toro concluded
in her message. "It brings great
joy to see so many ideas come to
fruition throughout the years.
We're going ten years strong and
still fighting obstacles knowing'
ultimate success."

HBO Go, "Game of Thrones" is
as formidable a presence as its
characters. Despite an expansive
cast and sprawling storylines,
HBO's signature drama series
continued to showcase cohesive,
strong storytelling. "Game of
Thrones" is the rare series whose
execution surpasses its enormous
ambition, and in season four, the
stakes are higher, the emotion is
deeper and the looming notion
that "all men must die" ensures
continued excellence and intrigue
fromthemostcompellingserieson
television.
"Game of Thrones" has never
been reluctant to put its characters
in harm's way, consistently
delivering major deaths in every
season - but the Red Wedding
has boosted the series to an
entirely new level. In the wake
of season three's penultimate
bloodbath, there's a heightened
level of suspense throughout the
season four premiere. Robb
Stark's vacancy doesn't dictate a
significant amount of the story,
though his - and his mother's
- absence is a driving emotional
presence.
In the season's tone-setting
opening moments, Tywin
Lannister uses the Valyrian
steel from Ned Stark's sword
to fashion two smaller blades.
With three Starks dead, two
missing and another married
into the Lannister clan, the
titular "Two Swords" served as
a not-so-subtle reminder of the
Lannister's dominance over the
Stark family.
Across the Narrow Sea,
Daenerys' path to the Iron
Throne continues, as she leads
her army on the 100-mile path
towards Meereen. Daenerys is
testing the limits of both her
relationship with her dragons
and her potentially romantic
relationship with Daario
(Michiel Huisman, "Nashville,"
in the role previously occupied
by Ed Skrein).
Already, it seems much
of season four will hinge on
transformations - adjusting
to new surroundings, realities
and restrictions. In King's
Landing, Jaime is forced to
adapt to his disability while
his siblings, Tyrion and Cersei,
settle into equally unfortunate
relationships. At Castle Black,
Jon Snow must re-acclimate to
life in the Night's Watch after
his adventure beyond the wall.


And for both Arya and Sansa, their sword, the youngest Lady Stark

There's also other side stories
that will either be eliminated
or brought to a head because of
Will's death. The Office of Public
Integrity has lost its case against
Peter Florrick in their voter fraud
investigation, so it's likely that
this story will fall by the wayside.
The most interesting story that
will probably continue to affect
the show for the rest of its run
is the love triangle between
Alicia, Peter and Will is now no
longer a triangle. The episode
"The Last Call" ended with
Alicia ignoring Peter in favor of
remembering Will. This could
be what sets a permanent divide
between husband and wife. This
is the place where the Kings have
several different paths and no one
is better (or worse) than the other.

won't know all the consequences
of Will's death until later on
in the show. The episode that
dealt with his passing featured
everyone grieving. There have
been concerns that this could be
the show's "jumping the shark"
moment because Will was such
an integral part of "The Good
Wife." But the sharp writing,
quick directing and fantastic
acting that the show as good as
it is will still be there. The Kings
will have some work to do to
redraw the stories, but they've
shown that they can reinvigorate
the show earlier this season, so
I'm betting they'll be able to do it
again.

Handler leads way
for Wolverines

'M' looks for first win over Bucks

By CLAIRE KINTNER
DailySports Writer
Erik Bakich's young son Colt
rus Junior Brook Handler made
quite a mark at the Raleigh
Relays Invitational two weeks
ago - or better yet, more than
one mark.
In a field of 64 runners, her
career best time of 4:18.28 in the
1,500-meter run managed to not
only become the top time in the
Big Ten, but also be the second-
fastest time in the nation so far
this outdoor season.
Handler's success carried
her even further, earning her
the Big Ten Athlete of the Week
last week, the first of her career
and the first for Michigan this
season. The last Wolverine to
win the award was fifth-year
senior Jillian Smith last May.

Shannon Osika took second with
4:23.62. Handler earned her
second first-place finish later
in the afternoon in the 3,000-
meter run with a time of 9:28.78,
while freshman Corinne Florie
secured third in 9:37.98.
"I think the scored meets
are a good opportunity to
practice racing because it's not a
situation where you're trying to
run for time like you are at some
other meet where you're trying
to get a mark," Handler said. "At
scored meets, you're just trying
to run for place, which is what
you do at Big Tens. It's a really
high-energy atmosphere and
everyone is there rooting for
each other."

midweek game this season.
But with little time to reflect,
Michigan (4-5 Big Ten, 14-18-1
overall) needs to push the loss
from its mind when it travels
to Champaign this weekend if
it wants to make the Big Ten
Tournament.
"Once it's over, it's over," said
senior catcher Cole Martin. "You
can't dwell on a big win or a bad
loss. Once it's over, you got to
move on to the next one - the
next 200 feet we like to call it.
"Our next big challenge is
going to be Friday at Illinois. Not
Saturday, not Sunday, not next
week ... Friday."
Martin hasn't been behind
the plate since April 2, when he
left midway through the Central
Michigan game due to tightness

in his elbow. Though he didn't
play Wednesday, he said he
feels fully healthy and is now
projected to don the catcher's
gear once again.
And after the Wolverines'
season high six errors against
the Fighting Irish, the return
couldn't come sooner. With
Martin back behind the plate,
he should provide the leadership
and experience the defense
needs to minimize errors against
the fourth best hitting team in
the Big Ten.
"I think (we need to) just be
ourselves," Martin said. "You
saw when we were playing well,
we were posting zeroes up on
errors and playing consistently
by making the routine play and
web-jams when we needed to
make them."
The Fighting Illini's catcher
Jason Goldstein leads the team
with a .382 batting average,
good for third in the conference.
Though Illinois (5-1, 17-11) is
stacked offensively, sophomore
left-hander Evan Hill will be up
for the challenge Friday.
Hill's one of two pitchers
who have shown consistency
after he pitched 6.1 innings in
last Saturday's 8-1 win over
Minnesota, when he struck four
batters and allowed just five hits.
But a defense led by Hill and
Martin won't earn Michigan
a win if the Wolverines fail to
warm up their bats. It remains to
be seen who Illinois will pitch in

the series opener, but no matter
who it is, Michigan will have to
improve from Wednesday's .133
team batting average if it hopes
to even its Big Ten record..
To do that, Martin said his
team needs to stick to its usual
approach of getting the leadoff
hitters on base for the big hitters
to drive in runs, but even that
has failed recently. Junior center
fielder Jackson Glines, third in
the lineup, has been put ina two-
out bases-loaded situation twice
in the last week, only to make
nothing of it.
"Every time you go up there,
you're not trying to hit a home
run," Martin said. "You're just
trying to get the barrel on the
ball and get things to happen."
The Wolverines' results this
weekend could determine where
they end in the Big Ten rankings
this season, especially after
being predicted to tie for fifth
with Illinois in the preseason.
The last question remaining is
which team will show up.
It could be the one Hill led
in the win against the Golden
Gophers, when Michigan didn't
allow a run through seven
innings.
Or it could be the error-prone
one that gifted four runs in three
innings against Notre Dame
while having the second-worst
batting performance of the
season.
For Bakichandhis Wolverines,
they need to be the former.

Horford to transfer next year

Redshirt junior is
eligible to transfer
to any school
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
In a rather shocking
development, the first Michigan
men's basketball player to
announce his departure this
offseason is Jon Horford.
On a day that began with
reports that sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas had decided to
depart for the NBA Draft -
Stauskas later shot down the
notion that he had reached a final
decision - the Wolverines lost a
player who was expected to be
an integral part of next year's
lineup.
"My time at Michigan has
been the most beneficial period
of my life in terms of athletic'

enlightenment," Horford said in
a statement. "The bonds created
over the last four years are
everlasting, and the memories
made are truly priceless. As on
all journeys, new paths must
be taken and intuition must be
trusted. I leave Michigan with
nothing but love in my heart."
Horford, who averaged 3.8
points and 4.2 rebounds in
slightly less than 14 minutes.

"Over the past couple months,

Really dominates, shoots the ball
well."
Another option, one Michigan
coach John Beilein hinted at
during his Wednesday press
conference, is seeking a transfer
to fill a void - a practice he
used regularly while coaching
Richmond, Canisius and West
Virginia.
"If we have openings and
there are transfers that fit who
we are, we are open to that,"
Beilein said.
With Morgan gone, Michigan
also loses another active voice
in the locker room. Should
Robinson leave too, Michigan
would have to replace each of its
captains for the second offseason
in a row.
"Jon has been an integral part
of our many accomplishments
over the last four years,"
Beilein said. "He brought great
enthusiasm, leadership and work
ethic to our program. Jon is a
wonderful young man who has a
very bright future ahead of him.
"We will be rooting for him
every step of the way."

Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas
was following in the steps of
former guard Trey Burke.
Burke led the Wolverines to
the Final Four last year; Stauskas
carried the team into the Elite
Eight this March. Burke was
named last year's Big Ten Player
of the Year; Stauskas took home
the honor in 2013-14.
Thursday morning, a report
from ESPN's Jeff Goodman said
that he'll be following Burke again
- this time to the NBA.
Goodman reported that a
source close to Stauskas said that
he had made his decision and
would announce his intentions to
declare for the NBA Draft shortly.
Stauskas took to Twitter
shortly after the report surfaced
to reiterate that any decisions
about his future were not final yet.
"Just wanted to reiterate that
any reports about my future
intenions are FALSE!" Stauskas
said on Twitter. "I have NOT
made ANY decisions on my future
yet!"

Later Thursday, the guard told
ESPN.com that he had not made a
final choice as to whether he will
return for his junior season in
Ann Arbor. His father reiterated
a similar message to UM Hoops.
The sophomore spent last
weekend at home in Mississauga,
Ontario, weighing his decision
with family and friends.
The6-foot-6guard led theteam
in scoring this year, averaging
17.5 points per game. He shot 47
percent from the field and 44
percent beyond the arc, and he
also had a team-best 118 assists.
The stats were good enough for a
spot on the NABC All-American
first team.
After his freshman season,
Stauskas stayed on campus to
work on his game and his body.
He added 16 pounds of muscle,
which helped him transform his
game by giving him the ability to
drive and get points in the paint
Experts have him slotted as
a mid-first round pick on the
cusp of the lottery. Gary Parrish,
a national columnist for CBS
Sports, has Stauskas going as the
15th pick to the Atlanta Hawks.

tremendously, with her physical
strength showing the greatest
improvement.
When Williams first started
training with the Wolverines,
she wasn't 100 percent. One

of her thighs was significantly
smaller than the other because
of a knee injury that required
surgery her senior year of high
school.
By focusing on strength and
conditioning, Williams has
made significant strides in her
endurance and ability.
Now, Plocki feels confident
about putting in Williams
because of her dependability
her competition performance
reflects her arduous training
regimen.
Her role as an alternate
throughout the majority of
the season hasn't diminished
her competition her input into
training and her work ethic is
the same in the gym and in the
classroom. Earning Academic
All-Big Ten recognition, the
neuroscience major values her
education.
"Even though you're the
alternate, you're right on the
edge," Williams said. "You need
to think of yourself as being in

the lineup because if something
happens to someone, or there's a
situation where you need to go in
essentially, you are in the lineup,
so you just have to train with that
mentality."
With the Wolverines
constantly pushing people in the
lineup, alternates help the team
effort as a whole and separate
the top teams from everyone else
in terms of depth.
Intheupcomingseason,Plocki
sees her as a threat for a lineup
spot on floor. But for now, only
one thing is on the 20-year-old's
mind: NCAA Championships. As
the team prepares for nationals,
Williams can feel secure about
her spot in the bars and beam
lineups.
"I love seeing success stories
like this because she's been
working extremely hard and she
got to where she is today from
putting in so much blood, sweat
and tears into what she's doing,"
Plocki said. "It's paying off for
her and for us."

Lindsay Williams has overcome knee surgery to be a critical part of th team.
