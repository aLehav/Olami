The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 

Department is beginning 2018 
with a new addition to its force. 
Tuesday, Jason Forsberg began 
his tenure as Deputy Chief of 
Police of the AAPD.

Forsberg 
joins 
current 

Deputy Chief Robert Pfannes 
and 
will 
be 
in 
charge 

of 
the 
support 
services 

division, 
which 
includes 

the administrative services, 
professional 
standards 
and 

special services sections. The 
department typically has two 
deputy chiefs, however, the 
second position had been open 
since April 2016, following the 
promotion of chief Jim Baird 

and retirement of former AAPD 
deputy chief Greg Bazick — 
replaced by Pfannes. 

Most 
recently, 
Forsberg 

worked as deputy chief at 
the University of Michigan-
Dearborn campus. Prior to 
working 
in 
Dearborn, 
he 

served with the University 
of 
Michigan- 
Ann 
Arbor 

Department of Public Safety 
and Security for 20 years. 
He worked many positions 
including 
police 
officer, 

sergeant, 
lieutenant 
and 

captain.

Forsberg 
earned 
his 

bachelor’s 
degree 
from 

Skidmore College in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. and graduated 
from 
the 
Northwestern 

Monday 
night 
the 

University’s 
Museum 
of 

Natural 
History 
officially 

closed its space in the A.G. 
Ruthven Museums Building, 
after one last night at the 
museum. 

The museum, which will 

reopen 
in 
the 
Biological 

Sciences Building in several 
phases throughout 2019, has 
been housed in Ruthven since 
the building’s opening in 1928. 
The museum was originally 
known 
as 
the 
University 

Museum, and encompassed 
the Museums of Paleontology, 
Zoology and Anthropological 
Archaeology, as well as the 
University Herbarium. The 
Museum of Natural History 
was officially created in 1956.

The University decided to 

move the museum once the 
plans for the new Biological 
Sciences 
Building 
were 

announced in 2011. Though 
this has been planned for 
several years, Amy Harris, 
director of the Museum of 
Natural 
History, 
said 
the 

execution of the move will not 
necessarily be easy.

“The logistics of the next 

year, year and a half will be 
pretty challenging,” Harris 
said. 
“Within 
the 
public 

museum ... we’ve been hiring 
a lot of short-term staff to 
help with the project, and 
that’s been really terrific to 
have new ideas and new, fresh 

energy.”

The move has also been 

difficult 
for 
community 

members. 
Generations 
of 

people 
have 
enjoyed 
the 

current museum over the 
years and are sad to say 
goodbye. To aid with the 
transition, 
the 
museum 

created Museum Memories 
in December 2016 as a part of 
the University’s Bicentennial 
initiative and an online time 

capsule of sorts for people to 
share their favorite memories 
of the museum. 

Harris and her co-workers 

knew they close out the 
museum 
in 
a 
memorable 

way. They held a “Last Day 
at the Museum” celebration 
on Saturday— a free, all-day 
event open for the public to 
commemorate the end of an 
era. According to Harris, over 
3,000 people attended to see 

the museum one last time 
at Ruthven and share their 
memories once more.

“I 
describe 
it 
as 
a 

community hug,” Harris said. 
“I just felt the love.”

An additional ticketed New 

Year’s Eve event was held on 
Sunday evening. Over 3,000 
people were in attendance 
for a night of dinner, dancing, 
specialty lighting and New 

The Federal Communications 

Commission voted on Dec. 14 
to end net neutrality, which 
blocked 
internet 
service 

providers 
from 
charging 

different prices for different 
users or content. Though the 
Trump administration believes 
that the regulatory rollback 
will help American business, 
University 
students 
and 

faculty are concerned about its 
potential effects.

Under the new leadership 

of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai 
— 
appointed 
by 
President 

Donald Trump last January— 
the 
commission 
has 
begun 

to 
advocate 
for 
removing 

regulations 
which 
restrict 

internet companies as part of 
a broader push for regulatory 
rollback 
across 
various 

government 
bodies. 
The 

commission voted 3-2 to repeal, 
with 
Republican 
members 

voting with Pai and Democrats 
against.

The decision has attracted 

controversy and criticism from 
a wide variety of citizens and

Initiative worked with Michigan Creative to make poverty, health data accessible

Four University researchers 

have recently developed an 
online data map displaying 
poverty statistics throughout 
the state of Michigan. The 
University’s Poverty Solutions 
Initiative in the Ford School of 

Public Policy collaborated with 
Michigan Creative in efforts 
to display poverty and health 
data in a more reader-friendly 
format.

The 
online 
interactive 

map 
displays 
statistics 
on 

median income, percent of the 
population below the poverty 
line, percent of single-parent 

households and other statistics 
by county. Data comes from the 
U.S. census, United Way, CDC 
Community Health Indicators 
and the Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation.

Strategic Projects Manager 

Kate 
Naranjo 
felt 
public 

data was not available in an 
easily adjustable format and 

was instead more catered to 
researchers. This inspired a 
collaboration with H. Luke 
Shaefer, associate professor of 
social work and public policy, 
along with three undergraduate 
research assistants to develop 
an 
online 
map 
displaying 

poverty 
data.

On Dec. 30, Ann Arbor police 

arrested 63-year-old Michael 
Brooks on multiple counts of 
home invasion after identical 
footprints 
were 
discovered 

at two crime scenes. Brooks’ 
victims include David Goldwyn 
and his wife on Minerva Road 
and a group of four University 
of Michigan students living on 
Linden Street, close to Central 
Campus. 
However, 
police 

expect there may be more 
victims as students return to 
Ann Arbor from winter break.

According to WXYZ Detroit, 

Goldwyn and his wife heard a 
noise in their home followed 
by the sounding of their home 
security alarm. The couple 
discovered a man walking from 
their house and the suspect’s 
footprints left in the snow 
leading to their living room 
window.

Engineering 
senior 
Kyle 

Winstanley is choosing Bitcoin 
over his bachelor’s degree.

Winstanley plans to pursue 

cryptocurrency trading full 
time instead of graduating 
college. Partnered with his 
classmate, LSA senior Spencer 
Porter, 
the 
pair 
amassed 

around $15,000 by Dec of last 
year, and have now collected 
almost $70,000 to date to 
contribute to their trading 
hub.

Bitcoin 
is 
a 
type 
of 

cryptocurrency, 
a 
digital 

form of currency that utilizes 
cryptography 
for 
security 

purposes. It is not tied to 
a 
government 
entity, 
and 

due to the private nature of 
transactions, can be used for 
illegal purchases.

In an interview with Forbes, 

Winstanley 
emphasized 
he 

hopes to one day return to 
school and finish his degree 
but did not want to miss out on 
the opportunity to capitalize 
on the cryptocurrency market.

“I’m not opposed to trying 

to finish school and I’d love 
to have my degree at some 
point and come back and get 
it,” 
Winstanley 
said. 
“But 

I couldn’t let this market 
happen again without my full 
attention on it.”

The housemates said they 

became 
infatuated 
with 

Bitcoin in August 2017 when 
they joined a cryptocurrency 
discussion group on Facebook. 
From 
there, 
they 
began 

networking 
with 
other 

students — sharing various 

market 
predictions 
and 

analyses between each other.

In 
the 
same 
interview, 

Porter 
said 
he 
spent 
an 

immense amount of time — 
from August to December — 
researching Bitcoin exchange 
and keeping track of data. He 
plans to reduce his course load 
and graduate next year, rather 
than in the spring, in order 
to devote as much time as 
possible to the exchange.

“I logged over 2,000 hours 

in the last four months in 
research, charting analytics 
and 
data, 
and 
it’s 
really 

become a passion,” Porter said. 
“I wake up every morning and 
I’m excited to begin to learn.”

In fact, rather than using 

his 
apartment 
as 
a 
quiet 

study area, Winstanley will 

convert his apartment into a 
Bitcoin trading space for the 
new semester — replete with 
a large projection screen and 
up to 12 monitors displaying 
the fluctuations of various 
cryptocurrency 
exchanges 

occurring around the world.

Porter 
emphasized 
the 

number of opportunities to 
profit off of Bitcoin exchange 
is decreasing, as various “big 
money” 
institutions 
have 

entered the market.

“For those that have not 

stepped in yet, the window is 
closing,” he said. “Wall Street 
and the big money has begun 
to enter. They are moving very, 
very fast.”

There were a few empty seats 

in lecture halls yesterday, as 
snow-bound students remained 
stranded in their home towns.

LSA 
sophomore 
Megan 

Schulze was eager to get back 
to Ann Arbor on time because 
she is waitlisted in a class she 
really wanted to take. But lake-
effect snow in her hometown of 
Muskegon, Mich., foiled her plans 
to arrive on Tuesday, causing her 
to miss two morning classes - 
including the waitlisted course.

“I’m hoping the snow is a good 

enough excuse to still get into the 
class,” she said.

Schulze was still unsure about 

driving yesterday, but finally left 
in the afternoon. The roads were 
still somewhat dangerous then, 
she said.

“From Muskegon to Grand 

Rapids, you couldn’t even tell if 
you were driving in the right lane, 
the left lane or in the middle of 
the road,” she said.

Other students haven’t made it 

back to Ann Arbor yet.

LSA first-year student Paul 

Caiano originally had planned to 
fly from his home in New York 
to Detroit Metropolitan Airport 
on Tuesday. But when his flight 
was canceled Tuesday night, he 
decided to relish his extra time at 
home.

Realizing 
he 
would 
miss 

yesterday’s classes even if he 
took the next flight out of New 
York and knowing that he had no 
classes tomorrow, Caiano decided 
to skip his classes scheduled for 
today and fly to Ann Arbor this 
Saturday.

“I’m not mad about the snow,” 

he said, “especially considering 
I get an extra four days with my 
girlfriend.”

As 
the 
snowstorm 
forced 

airports throughout the Midwest 
to close, airline passengers were 
stuck at airports, waiting for 
standby flights.

LSA junior Kevin Meconis 

spent two days with his family at 
the airport in Denver waiting for 
the next available flight home.

“It was really boring,” he said. 

“I went through a lot of batteries 
on my CD player.”

Rowell Huesmann, professor 

of communication studies and 
psychology, also was left without 
a flight in Denver this past 
weekend. He decided to rent a 
car and drove with his son from 
Denver to Ann Arbor.

“The roads weren’t bad at 

all until we got to Chicago,” 
Huesmann said.

Those who were able to make 

the trip back to Ann Arbor on time 
faced treacherous conditions.

With medical school classes 

starting 
this 
past 
Monday, 

Medical 
first-year 
student 

Debbie Kwon urgently wanted 
to get to Ann Arbor by Sunday 
night. 
Despite 
the 
warnings 

and advice of friends who told 
her not to go, Kwon, along with 
two undergraduate University 
students, set out from Cincinnati 
on Sunday evening. But about 
halfway through the drive, her 
car skidded across the freeway, 
making a 180 degree turn amidst 
a crowd of cars and landed in the 
median.

As another passing driver was 

watching Kwon’s car skid, he 
lost control of his own car, and it 
flipped over twice in the middle 

of the highway, Kwon said.

“It was like a movie,” Kwon 

said.

Kwon’s car was towed out of 

the median and she kept driving, 
anxious to get to Ann Arbor for 
her Monday class

But an hour and a half later, 

the three students were set back 
again, when the car did another 
180 degree turn in the middle of 
the freeway even though they 
were driving at a low speed.

After being towed out of the 

median a second time, Kwon said 
she decided to stop for the night.

“I was willing to keep going,” 

she said, “but (my passengers) 
wanted to stop.”

She drove at 20 miles per hour 

until they arrived at Findlay, Ohio 
where the three students found 
the last available hotel room in 
the city. Kwon’s car survived the 
trip without any damage, and the 
passengers were not injured.

Kwon said while the experience 

was definitely very scary, it was 
also inspiring to see how many 
people stopped to help out when 
her car was stuck in the snow.

“The whole incident revived 

my hope in humanity,” she said.

Tazin Daniels presents on student pedagogy to fellow graduate student instructors at the CRLT GSI training session at the Michigan League Tuesday.


Creative assisted in putting the 
data into map form.

“Poverty is really widespread 

across 
the 
state,” 
Naranjo 

said. 
“It’s 
not 
necessarily 

concentrated in just Detroit 
like I think the narrative goes. 
There’s a lot of rural poverty in 
this state and a rising amount 
of suburban poverty.”

LSA 
junior 
Zachary 

Tingley, a research assistant 
for the project, said he noticed 
his own attitude shift about 
poverty as a result.

“I 
realized 
that 
we 

talk about poverty ... as a 
(very) urban issue but it’s 
important to know there’s 
a 
lot 
impoverished 
rural 

neighborhoods as well and a 
lot of action that can be taken 
in those areas,” Tingley said.

According to the database, 

Washtenaw 
County 
has 
a 

median income of $66,040, 
14.6 percent of the population 
is under the poverty line and 

8.5 percent of the population 
receives food stamps/SNAP 
benefits. The state’s averages 
were a median income of 
$47,944, 
15.1 
percent 
of 

the 
population 
below 
the 

poverty, and 14.7 percent of 
the population receiving food 
stamps/SNAP benefits.

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel has worked with 
LSA to develop a new major 
on the study of socioeconomic 
status, 
which 
should 
be 

implemented in 2018 or 2019.

In an email to The Daily, she 

said she thinks the map could 
use some adjustments, but 
believes it will help Congress 
and 
other 
communities 

understand county needs.

“It would help to have 

data from individual cities as 
well to better interpret the 
information,” 
Schandevel 

said. “I think, especially in the 
coming year as Congress moves 
to slash benefits for low income 
individuals, this map will help 
us determine which counties 
will be most affected.”

In 
a 
statement 
to 
The 

Daily, Shaefer said he hopes 

to show University students 
they can assist communities 
in improving their residents’ 
lives.

“Any one statistic really only 

shows a piece of the puzzle,” 
Shaefer said. “We hope that 
this map streamlines things for 
Michigan communities so they 
can look at a range of things 
and learn more about the 
strengths and opportunities 
for improving the lives of 
residents. This is the type 
of service that great U-M 
students can offer.” 

Naranjo said he also hopes 

this 
project 
betters 
the 

University’s relations with the 
general public. The team aims 
to add more, as well as updated, 
statistics to the map.

“I think it’s just really 

important to think about how 
we as a research institution 
can better communicate to the 
general public,” Naranjo said. 
“I think this is an example of 
one way to do that, to translate 
really 
wonky 
stuff 
into 

something the average person 
could look at and understand.”

University School of Police Staff 
and Command in 2014. In 2016, 
he earned a criminal justice 
certificate from the University of 
Virginia and graduated from the 
FBI National Academy. Forsberg 
is currently pursuing a Master’s 
of Public Administration at U-M 
Dearborn.

While he enjoyed his 14 

months in Dearborn, Forsberg is 
excited to be back in Ann Arbor.

“I’ve worked 21 years as a 

cop and this was the first year 
I didn’t work at the football 
games,” 
Forsberg 
said. 
“It 

wasn’t that I actually missed 
working the football games 
because my family appreciates 
having me home, taking my kids 
to soccer games, but it didn’t 
really feel like fall because I 
wasn’t spending all of football 
Saturdays in Ann Arbor. I miss 
the community but also the law 
enforcement community that’s 
in Washtenaw County.”

Although in the past Forsberg 

has worked for a university as 

opposed to a city, he said his 
prior experience lends itself to 
the new position.

“I can take some of the 

experiences I’ve had both in 
Dearborn and my career in 
U-M Ann Arbor and apply them 
to the city policing,” Forsberg 
said. “It’ll be similar, but it’s 
a 
bigger 
department. 
The 

main difference is different 
jurisdictional boundaries and 
the size of the department.”

DPSS works very closely with 

the AAPD in matters of mutual 
concern, such as football games 
and crimes that occur on or near 
campus.

LSA freshman Haley Gritz 

hopes Forsberg will help make 
Ann Arbor a safer place for 
students. She pointed to the 
recent home invasions around 
campus including the home 
invasion 
in 
the 
Northwood 

Community Apartments and the 
West Quad incidents as signs a 
new addition to the force might 
curb crime.

“Obviously you don’t want 

crime but there’s been a few 
home invasions and robberies,” 
Gritz said. “Having a new police 
chief might be a nice change 

and it could cut down on crime 
more.”

According to a press release, 

Ann Arbor Police Chief James 
Baird is excited to welcome 
Forsberg to the force.

“We are fortunate to bring 

in someone like Jason who has 
extensive experience, but also a 
local connection and familiarity 
with the culture in Ann Arbor,” 
Baird wrote.

Forsberg said he does not 

intend to make major changes to 
the department upon his arrival. 
Some of his minor plans include 
ways to make the department 
more efficient and, if needed, 
to maximize the opportunities 
for citizens to engage with the 
community.

“I’m a new guy coming in, it’s 

a top-notch police department,” 
he said. “They are renowned 
worldwide for being a good 
police department.”

Overall, Forsberg is looking 

forward to beginning his new 
position in Ann Arbor.

“There are a lot of really 

talented men and women that 
work at the department in Ann 
Arbor,” 
Forsberg 
said. 
“I’m 

excited to learn from them.”

Year’s festivities.

“It seemed like a natural 

watershed 
moment 
in 
the 

calendar to close the museum 
on New Year’s Eve, so we’ve 
been planning this weekend 
for many, many months,” she 
said. “It was amazing.”

Now 
that 
the 
space 
is 

officially closed, the museum 
staff will focus on moving 
to 
the 
Biological 
Science 

Building. Harris said the new 
museum will open in three 
stages. The first opening will 
occur in the fall of 2018 when 
the main atrium will open with 
the museum’s mastodons in 
the front hall and the ancient 
whales hanging overhead. The 
bulk of the museum will open 
in two additional stages — one 
in the spring of 2019 and one 
the following fall.

Staff will be doing many 

different 
things 
in 
the 

interim. Planetarium manager 
Matthew Linke said he will 
be spending the next year or 
so learning about the new 
planetarium 
software. 
The 

museum’s planetarium will be 
getting a major upgrade in the 
move, going from its current 
18-foot diameter dome to a 
30-foot one.

Sixty-four 
seats 
will 
be 

included, in addition to at 
least eight handicap-accessible 
spots, making it easier for 
visitors 
in 
wheelchairs 
to 

experience the planetarium. A 
lecture-hall style arrangement 
of seats and a stage-quality 
lighting system will allow the 
space to be used for a variety 
of events, and new state-of-
the-art software will allow 
for an expansion of the kind of 
images projected on the dome.

“It’s 
the 
highest-end 

planetarium software you can 
get,” Linke said. “We will have 
the ability of doing a lot more 
than the current system does.”

Other museum staff will 

focuse on making sure the 
museum stays active in the 
community via outreach to 
local 
schools. 
LSA 
senior 

Sara Lebow has worked at the 
museum since her sophomore 

year, and while in the past her 
job has frequently involved 
taking school groups around 
the museum for field trips, she 
thinks her role going forward 
will be mostly to bring the 
museum to these schools.

“I have a shift on Friday at 

the museum where I’m just 
answering questions there,” 
Lebow said. “But I’m pretty 
sure in the coming months it’ll 
be a lot of outreach, which is a 
huge part of what the museum 
does too. We go to schools, 
and then we go to different 

festivals for events.”

Lebow, like many others, is 

sad to see the Ruthven space 
go but looks at the move as 
a positive change for the 
museum.

“The museum as it is — 

which I love, I really love it 
— it’s really a time capsule of 
how museums used to be,” 
she said. “It’s not set up for 
field trips very well. It’s just 
not the best space for kids and 
school groups to be in … I think 
it’s really great that the new 
museum is going to be more kid 
and school group-focused.”

LSA 
senior 
Alexandra 

Contis, 
a 
museum 
staff 

member since her freshman 
year, 
echoed 
Lebow’s 

sentiments. She thinks the 
updates the museum will get 
as a result of the move, like air 
conditioning and a cafeteria for 
school groups, will be major 
improvements.

Contis 
also 
works 
in 

the gift shop, and during one 
of her recent shifts, a little 
kid walked up to her with a 
handful of dinosaur figurines. 
He told her he was going to 
use these dinosaurs to start 
his own museum, now that the 
Natural History Museum was 
closing.

“The fact that this has that 

sort of impact (is amazing),” 
she said. “And now this little 
kid is like, ‘I’m going to start 
my own museum with these 
stuffed animals!’ He was so 
confident.” 

The closing of Ruthven is part 

of a shuffle in buildling space 
set to play out over the next few 
years. The Fleming bulidng, 
which houses the University’s 
administrative 
affairs, 
will 

be demolished in the near 
future. Those operations will 
move to a renovated version 
of the Ruthven building after 
the museum’s shift to the 
Biological Science Buildilng. 

activist 
groups. 
According 

to a survey conducted by 
the University of Maryland, 
83 
percent 
of 
Americans 

disapprove 
of 
the 
FCC’s 

plans to scrap net neutrality, 
including 
75 
percent 
of 

Republicans. Sixteen percent 
approve. The survey briefed 
respondents on arguments for 
both sides of the issue.

Many believe the internet 

should be regulated as a 
public utility and worry that 
the repeal of net neutrality 
will lead to internet service 
providers 
charging 
higher 

prices for faster internet, 
a practice that was illegal 
before the repeal. Politicians 
on both sides of the aisle have 
voiced their opposition to the 
FCC’s vote, including state 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 
Arbor.

“I think it’s one of the 

worst things that’s happened 
this year,” Rabhi said. “The 
biggest issue that needs to be 
resolved is who’s leading our 
country, and whether that’s 
a Republican or a Democrat, 
that person needs to have these 
core values that are shared by 
a vast majority of Americans. 
And that’s just not the case 
right now. And obviously, we 
have an FCC chairman and 
an FCC majority that is not 
respectful of the wishes of a 
majority of Americans.”

According to Rabhi, the 

FCC vote is indicative of an 
administration that places the 
interests of large companies 
before those of the people. 
He 
cited 
the 
widespread 

opposition to the repeal as 
evidence.

Rabhi worried the prospect 

of price discrimination for 
faster internet would greatly 
advantage wealthy consumers 
at the expense of poorer ones.

Michael 
Traugott, 
an 

adjunct professor of political 
science 
at 
the 
University, 

said he shared this worry, 
one he denoted as a very 

real 
possibility. 
Though 

internet providers are under 
much scrutiny as a result of 
the repeal and are unlikely 
to act quickly, he said, a 
gradual change would be 
consequential.

“My own view is that it is 

a negative change because 
the internet is so central to 
people’s daily lives in terms of 
gaining information about the 
world or about a business or 
about a research topic that we 
should be trying to get more 
people access and maintain 
a reasonable cost,” Traugott 
said.

The full extent of the impact 

on college students nationwide 
remains 
to 
be 
seen, 
but 

Traugott said the University 
has the power to protect 
students from high prices by 
paying for internet service for 
on campus resisdents, which 
would at least forestall some 
potential negative effects of 
the repeal. Depending on how 
the situation and markets 
evolve with the new changes, 
these students would require 
specific action to keep their 
access to high-speed internet.

Rabhi 
also 
expressed 

concern over other changes 
being implemented by the FCC 
under Pai, though these issues 
don’t attract the attention of 
net neutrality.

“Chairman Pai and the FCC 

— this is the most controversial 
of the changes they’ve made, 
but there is a lot of other stuff 
that has also been bad,” Rabhi 
said. 
“They’ve 
weakened 

the antitrust laws, which is 
damaging for competition in 
a free market economy. This 
stuff is also alarming.”

According to Traugott, the 

repeal could be reversed either 
through an act of Congress or 
a challenge in federal court. 
However, 
congressional 

action on the issue is unlikely, 
so a court case is the most 
likely eventuality.

However, 
the 
path 
of 

legal action is ambiguous 
and potentially difficult to 
navigate. 
The 
repeal 
was 

certainly in the FCC’s power as 
a government regulator. Legal 

challenges would thus have to 
focus on the inequalities that 
may be created as a result of 
the repeal, and the success of 
the challenge would largely 
depend on the strength of 
petitioners’ arguments.

In advice to concerned 

citizens, 
Rabhi 
said 
the 

best way to organize action 
around this national issue 
is through voting. Although 
municipalities can take some 
small 
actions 
to 
mitigate 

the 
effects, 
changes 
in 

representation are the most 
effective way to combat the 
repeal.

Traugott emphasized the 

full impact of the repeal is 
entirely unknown, and Rabhi 
agreed government response 
will depend on the outcomes 
of the repeal. Much depends 
on the behavior of telecom 
companies and voter activity 
in coming elections.

“We don’t know exactly 

what’s 
going 
to 
happen 

with the abolition of net 
neutrality,” 
Traugott 
said. 

“Since we’ve never functioned 
in this environment before, we 
won’t know about that until it 
happens.”

Engineering junior Daniel 

Chandross, 
who 
studies 

computer science, said he 
worries about the potential 
for finding jobs in smaller 
startups and corporations due 
to the end of net neutrality.

“These corporations have 

not done anything yet. So I 
think it would be unfair of me 
to say we have experienced 
hardship,” he said. “But I think 
the fact of the matter is, as 
someone who will be looking 
for a job soon, it makes it a 
possibility for it to be harder 
for small startups or smaller 
corporations to fight against 
the 
larger 
(corporations) 

like HBO, Netflix, Google, 
Facebook or whatever. So 
as someone who wants to 
go into the startup field, or 
another developing field, this 
funnels 
students 
towards 

larger and more established 
conglomerates and makes it 
difficult for smaller ones to 
attract talent.”

University students lived in 
the bottom half of the invaded 
duplexed home. The students, 
away on winter break, learned 
of the invasion when police 
recovered a laptop of one of the 
housemates in Brook’s vehicle.

“The day we found out about 

the break-in my housemate and 
I went to Ann Arbor to check 
what the police had found,” 
Kinesiology sophomore Max 
Miley said. “The robber had 
cut the screen off one of our 
windows and made his way in 
through there.”

The housemates assume the 

window remained unlocked 
as no other items in the home 
were damaged.

“He 
took 
some 
small 

electronics 
but 
left 
more 

expensive ones which was 
strange,” Miley said. “He also 
took my housemate’s gluten-
free pretzels and oatmeal — 
super odd looting.”

According to WXYZ Detroit, 

Lige sent the same group of 
officers 
to 
both 
invasions 

where they discovered similar 
distinctive shoe wear in the 
snow. The footprints matched 
and 
investigators 
located 

Brooks in a vacant apartment. 
After 
negotiations, 
police 

entered the apartment and 

found Brooks hidden in a 
bathtub.

“I think it is just crazy that 

(police) were able to take such 
a small piece of evidence and 
track down this guy,” David 
Goldwyn told WXYZ Detroit. 
“Odds were slim but there was 
fresh snow on the ground. They 
figured if they were going to 
find him footprints were going 
to be the way.”

Brooks had been on parole 

for similar crimes. Brooks has 
been charged in connection to 
five home invasions, though 
more charges are expected to 
be filed. He is currently held 
on $100,000 bond.

“The museum

I love, I really 
love it — it’s 
really a time 

capsule of how 
museums used 

to be”

W

hen 
I 
arrived 
at 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan this past 

fall, the decision to rush felt 
preconceived. I am a student 
surrounded by those of similar 
backgrounds; a Jewish boy from 
the suburbs of a big city, anxious 
to make friends with similarly 
identified people. Everyone I 
knew was doing it. It would make 
sense for me to rush, right?

At fraternity parties during 

Welcome Week, I met different 
brothers who’d ask if I was 
rushing. I would say yes in a voice 
that felt somewhat contrived, the 
octaves in my throat tumbling 
down. I strained to contain a 
part of myself that seemed close 
to spilling out.

I then realized how rushing 

was desultory with respect to 
my character. I still felt that I 
deviated from the stock “frat 
boy” image the media conjures. 
I am openly gay. I identify as 
a progressive feminist. I am 
actively seeking to dismantle 
a constricting gender binary. 
Aren’t the tenets of Greek life, 
an inherently heteronormative 
and 
androcratic 
institution, 

antithetical to those values? 
Would I be morally bankrupt 
for buying into a system where 
fraternity members are three 
times more likely to commit rape 
than non-greek students? 

With a guilty conscience, I 

nonetheless conformed. I did 
what all of my friends were 
doing.

After touring several houses 

and meeting dozens of older 
brothers, I chose a chapter 
where I felt I belonged. I could 
tell these were people I could 
be myself around, and they 
were nothing but welcoming, 
warm and inviting. I can truly 
say that I feel like a member of 
a brotherhood in which people 
care for each other. Rarely do I 
feel uncomfortable being open 
about my identity.

Yet, the implications of Greek 

life still weighed me down. As I 
became active in my pledge class 
as social chair, I was encouraged 
to invite girls to parties as part of 

the job. I thought about themed 
mixers and how they often 
objectify girls with titles such 
as “Office Hoes and CEOs.” Isn’t 
there a link? Isn’t objectification 
almost always the first step 
toward 
justifying 
violence 

against someone?

Furthermore, 
it 
wasn’t 

as 
though 
I 
resisted 
these 

objectives. I sent out messages 
to GroupMes saying how “lit” 
the night would be and that they 
should “come thru!” We would 
discuss which sororities we 
wanted to come and made group 
chats with them.

Then 
suddenly, 
the 

Interfraternity 
Council 

suspension on socials shook 
Greek life to its core, leading 

events to a standstill. In the 
wake of numerous sexual assault 
and 
hazing 
allegations, 
the 

governing body of fraternities 
shut the doors on parties. Social 
schedules 
and 
mixers 
were 

canceled and initiation term was 
halted. To some, it seemed as 
though the world was ending.

However, 
considering 
that 

this coincided with a period 
in our country where sexual 
harassment scandals roil the 
news 
with 
disheartening 

regularity, it seemed like an 
opportunity to engage with each 
other about our actions. What 
led to all of this?

Shouldn’t 
we 
have 
used 

this time to talk about what is 
inherently 
problematic 
about 

a system that devalues both 
women and men based on tiers? 
Or the ways in which hegemonic 
masculinity 
contorts 
our 

understanding of consent?

It appears as though on the 

whole, instead of harnessing this 
period as a time for introspection, 
the IFC suspension became an 
inconvenience waiting to pass. I 
heard groans about not having 
parties to attend. Even I became 
increasingly agitated waiting for 
Greek life to return to normal.

But then I recall what brought 

this on. I think about the girls 
whose lives have been disrupted 
and, in many cases, ruined by 
the sexual assaults they have 
experienced.

I even remember that I have 

been complicit in this system. My 
words become mired in socially 
unconscious terminology, talking 
about wanting to mix within 
other “tiers,” as if girls are any 
more or less worthy of respect 
based on an arbitrary rush 
process. Even coming up with 
mixer themes that place women 
in self-degrading positions was 
something I considered. Though 
girls 
should 
dress 
however 

they want, they shouldn’t feel 
compelled to do so by a sexist 
themed party.

Upon my fraternity’s executive 

council elections, I was appointed 
to be “Sorority Relations Chair.” 
At first, this prospect excited 
me. I love talking to girls and 
scheduling parties. It felt as if 
there was nothing more fitting. 
Although I’m enthusiastic to take 
on this role and help our fraternity 
get to know new people, I’m a 
hypocrite and I submit myself to 
exploitation. I have zero sexual 
intentions with any of the girls, 
but I know that my brothers 
have their own plans. While I 
am proud that my fraternity isn’t 
among the accused and feel that 
they are genuine, good men, this 
does not change the culture we 
sometimes foster.

It’s time to scrutinize the roles 

we seem inclined to put women in. 
Disallow complacency and speak 
up in every situation. Perhaps 
then Greek life can return safer 
and more accommodating than 
its previous incarnation. 

T

he past couple months 
have 
been 
eventful 

for 
special 
counsel 

Robert Mueller. In his broad 
investigation 
into 
President 

Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign 
and its possible connections to 
the Russian interference in the 
election, Mueller and his team 
have indicted several former 
Trump aides, including former 
campaign chair Paul Manafort 
and former National Security 
Advisor Michael Flynn, but his 
investigation has been subjected 
to intense and increasingly 
partisan scrutiny.

Mueller has faced hostility 

from the White House since 
his 
appointment 
as 
special 

counsel in May, with President 
Trump repeatedly disputing the 
need for a special prosecutor, 
and 
at 
times 
denouncing 

Mueller’s probe as a “witch 
hunt.” In contrast, Republican 
lawmakers, at least for the most 
part, initially praised Mueller’s 
appointment 
and 
voiced 

support for his investigation. 
Yet in recent weeks, criticism 
of Mueller, and the FBI in 
general, has been amplified, 
with many Republican members 
of Congress and conservative 
political 
commentators 

questioning the competence and 
impartiality of not only Mueller 
but also former FBI Director 
James 
Comey 
and 
Andrew 

McCabe, the current deputy 
director of the FBI.

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, 

called for Mueller’s resignation 
from the Russia investigation, 
while Rep. Francis Rooney, 
R-Florida, proposed a counter-
investigation into Mueller and 
his team. Rep. Louis Gohmert, 
R-Texas, 
was 
more 
brazen, 

asserting that Mueller is “out for 
a scalp” and wants to be “a hero 
of the left,” while also accusing 
McCabe of being “disrespectful” 
to 
the 
Republican 
Party. 

Conservative pundits cite the 
fact that several of Mueller’s 
hired lawyers are registered 
Democrats 
as 
evidence 
of 

Mueller being biased, and Fox 
News contributor Jesse Watters 
insinuated Mueller is acting 
like a potential Democratic 
candidate for president. 

These claims are fanciful at 

best, and downright delusional 
at worst. Mueller is a registered 
Republican (though his party 
affiliation is hardly related to 
his aptitude) and he earned 
a 
reputation 
for 
integrity 

during his long career with the 

Department of Justice and the 
FBI. There is no credible reason 
to doubt Mueller’s ability to run 
an independent and unbiased 
investigation.

But while this cadre of 

conservative critics represents 
the 
far-right 
wing 
of 
the 

Republican party, the tepid 
defense of Mueller provided by 
more moderate Republicans has 
enabled criticism of Mueller to 
spread from the fringe to the 
political mainstream, leaving 
his investigation on unstable 
ground as it enters a critical 
stage.

Naturally, Mueller, and the 

FBI in general, are not perfect. 
Some of the recent criticism of 

Mueller stems from reports that 
a member of Mueller’s team was 
dismissed for having sent anti-
Trump text messages during the 
presidential campaign. Though 
some conservatives pointed to 
this revelation as evidence of 
the probe’s supposed bias, their 
argument ignores the fact that 
Mueller had removed the agent 
in question swiftly, and months 
prior to the report, which, if 
anything, serves as a testament 
to his commitment to carry out 
an impartial investigation.

Likewise, Comey’s handling 

of the FBI investigation into 
Hillary Clinton’s private email 
server drew the ire of both 
liberals 
and 
conservatives. 

Though 
Comey 
severely 

mismanaged the investigation 
through his unorthodox public 
disclosure 
of 
the 
agency’s 

prosecutorial recommendations 
and 
his 
consequential 

decision to briefly reopen the 
investigation in the days leading 
up to the 2016 election, his 
missteps do not constitute clear 
biases, and it is implausible that 
Comey’s actions were politically 
motivated.

Attempts 
to 
denigrate 

Comey’s 
reputation, 
which 

have 
reemerged 
since 
his 

controversial firing by Trump, 
and the efforts to discredit 

Mueller’s 
investigation, 
are 

politically motivated, largely 
unmerited and deeply troubling. 
The 
current 
campaign 

against 
Mueller 
represents 

an encroachment of extreme 
partisanship into the spheres of 
law and justice.

The 
congressional 

investigations 
into 
Russian 

election 
interference 
show 

signs 
of 
devolving 
into 

counterproductive 
partisan 

jostling 
and 
grandstanding. 

House Republicans reportedly 
are preparing to conclude their 
investigation to the objection of 
House Democrats. The Senate 
Intelligence 
Committee’s 

investigation has been clouded 
by reports that President Trump 
pressured Senate Republican 
leaders to end their inquiries 
as quickly as possible. The 
uncertainty surrounding the 
congressional 
investigations 

underscores 
the 
importance 

and 
relevance 
of 
Mueller’s 

independent investigation.

Mueller has proven himself 

to be a fair and honest man 
fully qualified to lead the main 
investigation 
into 
Russian 

interference in the election and 
related matters. If President 
Trump 
and 
his 
campaign 

were uninvolved with Russia’s 
election meddling, his aides 
and 
allies 
should 
proceed 

with the utmost confidence 
that Mueller will vindicate 
him. However, Mueller must 
be 
allowed 
to 
thoroughly 

investigate and pursue charges 
as approporiate. 

It 
would 
be 
grossly 

improper to impede Mueller’s 
investigation 
on 
partisan 

grounds, and the possibility 
of Trump firing Mueller has 
received considerable media 
attention. 
However, 
given 

Trump’s repeated pledges to 
not fire Mueller, Mueller’s 
investigation 
is 
perhaps 

more greatly endangered by 
partisanship. Recent partisan 
attacks on Mueller’s probe 
are unwarranted, yet they 
threaten 
to 
unduly 
shake 

public 
confidence 
in 
the 

investigation. 
Partisanship 

must be blocked from the 
domains of law and justice if 
the law is to retain its sanctity 
and 
independence. 
Failure 

to do so could have profound 
consequences, for the Russia 
investigation and beyond.

Don’t let partisanship threaten Mueller

2

017 was an exasperating 
year for many of us. 
Challenges 
in 
our 

personal lives, coupled with 
the anxiety induced by our 
world’s headlines, made for 
a uniquely intense feeling of 
exhaustion by the semester’s 
end. When I finally landed 
in Los Angeles, my smog-
blanketed home, I couldn’t 
tell whether I was happy to 
be home and at rest, or out of 
breath now that I could finally 
be still.

My friend likes to remind 

me that the road to hell is 
paved with good intentions. 
It’s not quite the first thing I 
want to hear after I mess up, 
but it provides balance to the 
idea that “it’s the thought that 
counts.”

If I had a dollar for every 

time I thought about going to 
church, I could probably build 
one in my backyard. It’s not 
that I hate the idea of religion, 
but it doesn’t dictate my life. 
In other words, I’m in the 
same place as a lot of people 
regarding my faith.

As I rolled my luggage to the 

front door, I was surprised to 
see a wreath— I’d forgotten it 
was almost Christmas. There 
were 
more 
responsibilities 

to worry about than ever this 
year, and fewer Christmas 
movies, advertisements and 
music meant I never thought 
less about this formerly Earth-
stopping time of the year.

As Christmas snuck up on 

me, I remembered those good 
intentions of mine to practice 
my faith, and how consistently 
I failed to do so this semester. 
Would I succeed on December 

25th? Did I even want to?

I made plans with my dad 

on Christmas and Christmas 
Eve. I set my alarms on 
December 
23rd 
and 
went 

about my Saturday. My friends 
and I celebrated being back 
together, almost done with 
one of the hardest years of our 
short lives.

As usual, I slept through the 

three alarms I set for Mass, 
laying another brick in the 
road to hell.

After he came back from 

church, my dad and I went to 
visit a family friend, his best 
friend as a matter of fact. They 
immigrated 
to 
the 
United 

States together from Egypt and 
had plans to become priests 
until they met their wives.

As I listened to him recount 

his year, two things stuck out 
to me. One, he had a year filled 
with many personal hardships 
and two, unbelievably, he still 
seemed happy — at peace, even.

This was a man who lost 

his teenage son to cancer. 
Undoubtedly, he had endured 
more than most could bear. It’s 
not because he wasn’t furious 
at God, and it’s not that he 
moved on or forgot or didn’t 
feel pain.

Suffering is a blessing, he 

told me, because it helps you 
comfort others when they 
suffer. I sat in amazement as 
my whole year transformed. 
What I formerly considered the 
hardest year of my life became 
a year of intense empathy.

Renewal washed over me as 

we left his house. This must be 
how religious people felt when 
they connected with God. I 
used to envy those people for 

their steadfastness. How could 
they still have faith in the face 
of natural disasters, diseases 
and such great suffering?

No, I still can’t explain 

those things, nor do I ever 
expect to. I still cannot bring 
myself to accept evil as an 
irremovable element of our 
world, because I don’t want to 
become jaded. I don’t want to 
stop fighting against it.

But perhaps this is part of 

the balance that makes life 
what it is. It’s okay to feel 
exasperated, to delight in the 
ability to even feel negative 
emotions. The real tragedy is 
to feel nothing.

Later that night, as I was 

recounting this epiphany to 
a friend, they asked me about 
my plans to go to church. My 
new intention was to go to 
Mass at midnight. Knowing 
I might flake, he insisted 
that he would go with me for 
support, even though he’s 
Jewish. 

We stood in the back, 

overlooking the pews in full 
capacity. My resolve was not 
strong enough to get there 
soon enough to earn a seat. 
That was okay with me. I was 
just happy to be there.

In a time when it’s easy 

to lose hope, Mass lit up my 
spirits, a refuge of warmth 
during a cold winter. My 
friend and I broke bread at 
a Jewish deli afterward, for 
balance. It may be true that 
the road to hell is paved with 
good intentions, but maybe 
the road to heaven is, too.

There’s a moment in “The 

Last Jedi” when all the sound 
drops out and complete silence 
descends. For a few seconds, 
there is nothing. No music, no 
white noise, no dialogue. All 
falls away, and for a franchise 
that has always been easily 
recognizable 
for 
its 
iconic 

sound design and legendary 
score, it’s a strange moment, 
yet an undeniably brilliant 
one. “The Last Jedi” functions 
in much the same way. Much 
of 
what 
has 
historically 

characterized 
“Star 
Wars” 

on 
a 
superficial 
level 
is 

deconstructed and subverted 
here even as director Rian 
Johnson 
(“Looper”) 
takes 

special care to celebrate the 
most 
important 
things 
— 

namely the focus on battles 
between good and evil and the 
sense of hope in the face of 
insurmountable odds. The film 
he crafts is a bold, dark and 
occasionally weird entry in 
the “Star Wars” saga, one that 

stands as the best and most 
necessary chapter since “The 
Empire Strikes Back.”

This isn’t to say that “The 

Last Jedi” is perfect. While 
several sequences serve to 
further character arcs, they 
often feel disconnected from 
the central plot, and a certain 
scene stands out as particularly 

ill-advised, brought to life by 
a special effect that — in an 
otherwise visually gorgeous 
film — is comparatively subpar.

But couched in a story 

otherwise exceptionally told, 
these flaws do little to detract 
from the rest of the film. 
The film picks up moments 
after the end of J.J. Abrams’s 
“The Force Awakens,” as the 
Resistance, led by General 
Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, 
“Catastrophe”), must flee their 
base in the aftermath of their 
victory at Starkiller Base in 
the previous film. As the First 
Order doggedly pursues them 
through space, Rey (Daisy 

Ridley, “Murder on the Orient 
Express”) arrives at the site of 
the first Jedi temple to receive 
instruction from living legend 
Luke Skywalker (a never-better 
Mark Hamill, “Brigsby Bear”), 
only to find that he is not the 
man the galaxy remembers.

This base story, for what it 

is, is fine if occasionally slow-
moving. What sets it apart is 
the thematic work Johnson 
does with both his script and 
direction as he uses this plot to 
explore ideas of acknowledging 
the past and using it to grow 
while still letting go of what is 
not necessary for that growth. 
In essence, “The Last Jedi” 
is a story about the tricky 
relationship between the past 
and the future, history and 
legacy. The meta-narrative for 
a certain space opera entering 
its fourth decade of existence 
should be obvious.

Because in order to stay 

relevant, in order to mean as 
much to future generations as it 
did to me and the innumerable 
die-hards 
who 
have 
come 

before 
me, 
“Star 
Wars” 

needed to change. It would 
have been easy to rehash the 
same plotlines and archetypes 
ad infinitum — “The Force 
Awakens” did so and wound 
up being a pretty great movie, 
all things considered — but 

eventually, it would grow stale. 
Someone needed to break the 
mold, and “The Last Jedi” 
is Johnson doing so in bold 
fashion.

It would be easy to leave it 

at that, to act as if the boldness 
is enough to qualify “The Last 
Jedi” as a great movie, but it 
isn’t. Boldness alone is novelty; 
it must be grounded in the 
characters and the story. This 
is what makes “The Last Jedi” 
something truly special. It isn’t 
that it takes everything we 
think “Star Wars” can do and 
takes a hard left turn into new 
territory. It’s the way Johnson 
grounds 
those 
creative 

decisions in the characters, old 
and new, bringing them to more 
interesting, thought-provoking 
and 
emotionally 
intense 

places with each scene. It’s 
the way the actors bring those 
characters to life in some of the 
best performances in franchise 
history and the characters, in 
turn, embody the themes — 
redemption, bravery and hope 
above all — that have always 
defined “Star Wars” and will 
continue to define it even as it 
enters this new chapter.

I don’t even know how to 

begin writing about “Human 
Flow” 
by 
Ai 
Weiwei 
(“Ai 

Weiwei: Never Sorry”), because 
it is a piece that is so much 
bigger than us. It requires us 
to recognize our privilege in 
viewing such a crisis without it 
being a part of our own human 
experience. The documentary, 
which was shot in 23 countries, 
presents both a brutal, visceral 
and 
at 
times 
strikingly 

gorgeous display of the current 
global crisis in which 65 million 
people have been displaced 
from their homes.

Weiwei, known more for his 

controversial reputation in the 
art world, has participated in 
documentary cinema before, 
though never to this extent. 
As a visual artist, he treats his 
documentary like a canvas, 
splattering it with color and 
layers 
of 
impressive 
drone 

shots and handheld iPhone 
footage. He allows us to feel 
like we’re right there with the 
migrants and refugees — one 
or the individual body out of 
thousands, huddled into masses 

on a rugged terrain that has 
no remorse for its occupants. 
These migrants, tied down 
to no land to anchor them, 
are considered to be the most 
pervasive status of citizenship, 
as they are stripped of all the 
rights and liberties that make 
them human beings.

“Human Flow” reveals the 

global crisis that plagues every 
country, but mainly Europe 
today — the crisis of people 
fleeing their homes for asylum 

and passing through or being 
trapped in borders. The piece 
criticizes borders in general, 
as they are inherently arbitrary 
in their nature. With the aid 
of globalization, the world has 
reaped many benefits, namely 
the prospect of wealth and jobs, 
but its consequences are severe. 
Globalization 
exacerbates 

the global inequalities, and 
through this process, the large, 
connected 
world 
we 
know 

is beginning to shrink. This 
means that different cultures 
are going to have to learn to 
coexist in order for humanity 
to persist. Like the title, the 
flow of bodies in search of 

refuge and a new life are at risk 
of hunger, disease, death and 
above all, the loss of a chance 
for a better life.

Weiwei’s visual approach is 

guided by the natural landscape 
across these countries; the way 
the sky meets the unforgiving, 
arid and sun-scorched Middle 
Eastern deserts. The image 
of Mexican children playing 
on a beach with an iron fence 
running through it with the 
States on the other side is a 
painful reminder of palpable 
but still unattainable freedom. 
The 
sea 
connects 
these 

countries as a visual motif, but 
also as a juxtaposition of the 
free-flowing, wide open waters 
that touch country borders but 
cannot be shared equally by all. 
We see the sea that transports 
Eritreans to southern Italy for 
political asylum, the same sea 
that a group of friends in Gaza 
who turn to the Mediterranean 
for 
their 
only 
chance 
at 

tranquility in a war zone, the 

same sea that runs up to Tel 
Aviv just one hour north, the 
same sea and sun that caress 
their bronzed tourists is the 
same sea that traps others just 
down the coast.

If anything, the documentary 

reminds those of us who are 
fortunate enough to be citizens 
in a country — to feel like we 
belong somewhere and that 
we are protected — about how 
connected we truly are and 
how we choose to neglect this 
fact simply because we don’t 
see malnourished children in 
refugee camps daily, which 
the news likes to conveniently 
overlook, 
too. 
Europe 
and 

America were lands that were 
thought to provide promise 
and 
solace 
to 
immigrants, 

but Weiwei reminds us that 
the current xenophobia and 
segregation 
between 
these 

groups is not something we 
can ignore any longer. “Human 
Flow” doesn’t let us forget 
that, no matter what, we all 
share the same sun and no 
group deserves its warmth over 
others. It doesn’t let us forget 
that we need to stop forgetting 
about this crisis before it’s too 
late.

“Jumanji: 
Welcome 
to 

the Jungle” functions as a 
“legacy-quel” (a term coined 
to describe the recent trend in 
movies to release sequels after 
their original audience has 
had time to grow up and have 
little audience members of 
their own) to Robin Williams’s 
(“The Birdcage”) flick released 
22 years ago. In this updated 
version, instead of the titular 
board 
game 
bringing 
all 

sorts of jungle creatures into 
modern-day 
suburbia, 
four 

high schoolers are sucked into 
a virtual world, given different 
avatars to control and told that 
they must save the world in 
order to return home.

The 
crux 
of 
the 
film’s 

marketing was the idea of 
watching the stars of the 

movie playing against type 
in a particularly egregious 
way. Dwayne Johnson (“The 
Fate of the Furious”) plays the 
avatar of a nerd who’s afraid 
of 
everything. 
Kevin 
Hart 

(“Central 
Intelligence”) 
is 

the jock who pays Johnson’s 
“real life” character to do 
his 
homework. 
Jack 
Black 

(“Goosebumps”) 
is 
every 

teenage girl stereotype the 
writers could cram into a 
single character. The problem 
isn’t that there are no laughs 
to be mined from this. The 

conflict between a person’s 
outward appearance and who 
they actually are is some of 
the oldest joke material in the 
book. No, the problem is that 
after the first scene with the 
avatars, the shtick wears real 
thin real fast.

After that first scene, it 

becomes painfully obvious that 
no one involved, especially the 
writers, has any idea what to do 
with “Welcome to the Jungle” 
beyond repeating those same 

jokes ad nauseum. By the time 
Jack Black gets an overlong and 
embarrassingly 
extraneous 

scene in which he is taught by 
Johnson and Hart how to use 
his new penis — a sentence 
that, God help me, I can never 
unwrite — they’ve graduated 
from the shallow likeability 
they showed at first into a 
groanworthy monotony.

Not only does using this 

conflict as the cornerstone of 
the film hurt the comedy, it 
makes it all but impossible for 
any of the players to develop. 
The high schoolers are entirely 
defined 
through 
contrast 

with their avatars rather than 
through any growth of their 
own. Take Johnson’s character, 
Spencer, for instance. From 
the very beginning, everything 
about Spencer is in service to 
enforcing the idea that he is not 
a character The Rock would 
usually play. These characters 
are usually fearless, so Spencer 
is afraid of everything. They 
aren’t 
usually 
nerdy 
and 

socially awkward, so Spencer 
is both. There isn’t a single 
aspect of his personality that 
can’t adequately be summed up 
as not “The Rock,” and when 
a character is defined by what 
they aren’t as opposed to what 
they are, that doesn’t make 
for 
interesting 
storytelling. 

The actors all turn in fine 

performances, but they aren’t 
given much to do besides 
taking 
what 
they 
would 

ordinarily do and just doing 
the opposite.

Aside from that, there was 

a chance for “Welcome to the 
Jungle” to satirize gaming 
culture, 
as 
winked 
at 
by 

Karen Gillan (“Guardians of 
the Galaxy Vol. 2”), pointing 
out 
the 
absurdity 
of 
her 

avatar wearing a halter top 
in the middle of a jungle. 
Unfortunately, not only does 
the script completely abandon 
this idea after that first aside in 
favor of action scenes that make 
the sexualization of Wonder 
Woman in “Justice League” 
look subtle by comparison, but 
most of the movie plays like 
it was written by a 40-year-
old man who hasn’t touched a 
video game since 1996. What 
little dialogue isn’t taken up by 
repetitive jokes is filled with 
clunky exposition about video 
games that feels like someone 
opened the Wikipedia page 
for “video gaming” and just 
started copying paragraphs.

This lack of self-awareness 

and dated dialogue might be 
forgivable, but it’s compounded 
by the dearth of good humor, 
and almost any reason to see 
“Welcome 
to 
the 
Jungle” 

completely 
collapses 
under 

that weight. The only thing 
left is the simple nostalgia of 
seeing the original reimagined 
— references include a well-
intentioned 
reference 
to 

Robin 
Williams’s 
character 

that makes little sense and 
Bobby 
Cannavale 
(“Ant-

Man”) chewing scenery in the 
part originated by Jonathan 
Hyde (“Titanic”) — and that 
nostalgia, as in all legacy-quels, 

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM

Daily Arts Writer

‘Jumanji’ sequel fails despite good cast and performances

‘Welcome to the Jungle’ 
can’t match the original

When you hear moviegoers 

use the phrase “so bad it’s 
good,” your mind likely goes to 
Tommy Wiseau’s “The Room,” 
or perhaps to even more recent 
offerings such as “Sharknado” 
or “Birdemic: Shock and Terror.” 
With the recent release of “The 
Disaster 
Artist,” 
a 
comedic 

biopic about the making of “The 
Room” 
from 
actor/director 

James Franco (“The Vault”), the 
discussion 
surrounding 
films 

that are so bad they’re good has 
been renewed. However, the 
advent of the anti-masterpiece 
began 
long 
before 
Tommy 

Wiseau ever uttered the phrase, 
“Oh, hi Mark.” Rather, those 
examining the history of bad 
film should look to one Edward 
D. Wood Jr., the mind behind 
B-movie flops such as “Bride of 
the Monster” and “Plan 9 from 
Outer Space.”

In the 1994 film “Ed Wood,” 

director Tim Burton (“Miss 
Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar 
Children”) 
pays 
homage 
to 

Wood, posthumously awarded 
as The Worst Director of All 
Time. Starring Johnny Depp 
(“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead 
Men Tell No Tales”) as Ed Wood, 
the movie focuses on several 
aspects of the director’s life: His 
transvestitism, his film career 
and his friendship with actor 
Bela Lugosi.

Interestingly, the film never 

sets out to make fun of Wood 
but to celebrate his life and his 
uncompromising dedication to 
his dream. Over the course of 
the film, audiences see Wood do 
whatever it takes to film his next 
scene, whether that be begging 
for the attention of rich backers 
or convincing all of his friends 

to get baptised by a church in 
order to fund his movie. Depp’s 
charm makes Wood the ultimate 
underdog; as he stands behind 
the camera mouthing along to 
lines he wrote, pantomiming 
the facial expressions of his 
characters, Wood’s unbridled 
enthusiasm becomes contagious.

It’s this very contagiousness 

that sits at the center of the film’s 
message; for all his eccentricity 

and incompetence, Wood is 
never alone. He attracts an 
unwaveringly 
loyal 
band 
of 

Hollywood misfits from the once-
great actor Bela Lugosi (Martin 
Landau, “Abe & Phil’s Last Poker 
Game”) to Tor Johnson (George 
Steele, “Boston Girls”), a hulking 
Swedish wrestler. Never mind 
his ineptitude, never mind his 
penchant 
for 
crossdressing 

during 
the 
puritanical 
and 

straight-laced 
1950s, 
Wood’s 

magnetism and vision make 

him beloved by an ensemble 
of characters who don’t just 
tolerate his eccentricity but 
embrace it.

It’s in this way that Wood 

redefines “the artist’s struggle.” 
It’s 
not 
just 
the 
monetary 

struggle of the underappreciated 
artist, it’s also the struggle to 
stay true to oneself. This is 
poignantly depicted in a scene 
where a frustrated Wood storms 
off set and hops in a cab to the 
nearest bar. Upon arriving, he’s 
surprised to see his inspiration 
and idol Orson Welles sitting in 
a booth. Dressed head to toe in 
women’s clothing, he approaches 
Welles and the two converse as 
equals. There’s a certain coat of 
irony that comes in successful 
mega-stars playing struggling 
artists, but it melts away in this 
scene as we see the lauded Welles 
speak to Wood as if they were old 
friends. These artists, for all the 
disparity that may be present in 
the quality of their work, bond 
over common experiences. It’s 
here that the true message of “Ed 
Wood” reveals itself: The quality 
of your work isn’t as important 
as staying true to your vision.

It’s an important message, 

and one that likely answers the 
question of why we gravitate 
towards films like “Plan 9 from 
Outer Space” and “The Room.” 
Both Wood and Wiseau were 
men whose mediocrity at their 
craft played itself out with such 
passionate truthfulness that the 
result is irresistibly magnetic. 
Through all the raw, unbridled 
passion these artists hold, we 
can sense an uncompromising 
dedication to a dream. As Orson 
Welles says to Wood when the 
two directors depart: “Visions 
are worth fighting for. Why 
spend your life making someone 
else’s dream?”

Outback Bowl to South Carolina

WEDNESDAY

- BLOCKED

Michigan 19 - South Carolina 26

TAMPA, Fla. — The college 

football offseason is long. It’s even 
longer for teams that lose their 
final game of the season in the 
fashion Michigan did on Monday 
afternoon.

With 7:49 left in the third 

quarter of the Outback Bowl, the 
Wolverines needed just nine yards 
to extend their lead to 20 and put 
the game out of reach.

By the early fourth quarter, 

Michigan (8-5 overall) 
had completely collapsed, 
surrendering a 16-point lead to 
South Carolina (9-4).

The Wolverines tried 

their darndest to lose. So the 
Gamecocks obliged.

And in a 26-19 loss, Michigan 

found out that a mid-tier New 
Year’s Day bowl is no cure for an 
8-4 hangover.

“They got better as the game 

went on, no doubt,” said Jim 
Harbaugh. “They made plays to 
win the football game. We didn’t. 

We didn’t get the knockout 

punch when we needed it. 

Didn’t take advantage of 

the opportunities that 

were there.”

The game started 
how you would 

expect large 

college-aged men 

to behave the 

noon 

after 

New 

Year’s Eve.

Both teams, far from the college 

football heavyweights slated to 
play later on New Year’s Day, 
began their Monday afternoon in 
a stupor.

Midway through the first 

quarter, there were four times 
as many commercial breaks as 
combined first downs — the 
football equivalent of stumbling 
into your kitchen, bleary-eyed, 
only to discover you’re out of 
orange juice.

The Wolverines’ 9-3 lead 

certainly wasn’t a satisfying 
halftime result. At the very least, 
they had made fewer mistakes 
than the Gamecocks, who simply 
looked as if they were ready to 
head back to bed and sleep it off.

But that changed in the second 

half.

After Michigan’s first 

possession of the second half 
produced an efficient 7-play, 72 
yard touchdown drive, the errors 
began piling up. First, Karan 
Higdon fumbled near South 
Carolina’s goal-line, tanking a 
red-zone drive. The Gamecocks 
put together their first touchdown 
drive. Then Jake Bentley hit a 
leaping Bryan Edwards for a 
21-yard score following Sean 
McKeon’s fumble deep within 
Michigan territory.

“That was our fault,” Harbaugh 

said of the lost fumble. “It was 
a coaching error. We had the 

wrong personnel in there, 

and I should’ve called 
timeout.”

Bentley was only 

beginning to heat up. 
On the next drive, 
he completed a 

53-yard touchdown bomb 
to Shi Smith to give South 

Carolina its first lead of the game.

“(South Carolina) made the 

inside seam fade,” Harbaugh said. 
“Quarterback threw a really nice 
ball in the red zone. (They) were 
able to create some big plays.”

Michigan could only continue 

unraveling. The Wolverines were 
in the process of putting together 
a response when Brandon 
Peters, in an audition for next 
year’s starting job, tossed an 
unfathomable interception on 
third-and-goal from the five-yard 
line.

And to cap things off, putting 

the finishing touch on perhaps the 
most miserable stretch Michigan 
has suffered through all year, 
Donovan Peoples-Jones dropped 
a routine punt after the defense 
forced a crucial late stop.

Up to that point, viewers might 

have been asking themselves what 
other calamities could possibly 
befall the Wolverines. But — as 
this year may have taught — there 
is always more suffering to endure 
when you play sloppy football.

After the miscue, Peoples-

Jones lingered on the ground for 
a few extra moments, seemingly 
lamenting the mistake.

He couldn’t be blamed for 

taking the extra time to gather 
himself. After all, it was just that 
type of year for the Wolverines. 
Dropping your final three games 
— all in which Michigan held a 
lead at some point — can subdue 
even the most youthful and 
excitable of teams.

Michigan offensive miscues due to 
poor execution and predictability

TAMPA, Fla. — There’s a lot of 

blame that can go around when 
an offense performs the way 
Michigan’s did in its 26-19 loss 
to South Carolina.

203 passing yards on 45 

attempts 
with 
two 
crucial 

interceptions. 33 carries for 74 
yards with two backbreaking 
fumbles.

Those four turnovers, along 

with a muffed punt by freshman 
receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-

Jones, helped the Gamecocks 
erase a 16-point deficit in nearly 
the blink of an eye. And, as the 
old adage goes, once it started 
raining, it simply began pouring.

“They just grabbed ahold of 

that momentum and it just never 
really came back our way,” said 
senior left tackle Mason Cole. 
“When things like that are 
happening, you’re just waiting 
for that big play to happen and 
stop their momentum. It just 
never really did.”

Of course, most mistakes 

don’t just happen on their own. 
It takes a collective effort, like 
on a fumbled handoff exchange 
between Brandon Peters and 
Sean 
McKeon. 
It 
seemed 

peculiar that McKeon, a redshirt 
freshman tight end without any 
previous carries, would get the 
call on a crucial third-and-one.

Perhaps 
that 
was 
never 

supposed to be the case. After 
the game, Jim Harbaugh blamed 
the miscue on the coaching staff, 
noting that they had the wrong 
personnel in the game. It was 
a mistake that Peters realized 
as well. Yet it went unchecked, 
and the result was costly for the 
Wolverines.

“Yeah, I did realize it, but I 

thought (McKeon would) know 
what to do,” Peters explained. 
“When I snapped the ball, he 
seemed a little surprised that 
I was handing him the ball. I 
should’ve seen that and made 
sure he knew what he was 
doing.”

Similar 
miscues 
plagued 

Michigan’s drives throughout 
the second half. A missed block 
on a wide receiver screen. 
A missed block on the edge. 
A fumble from a normally 
dependable ball-carrier on the 
opponent’s four-yard line.

So as Peters framed it, yes, a 

lack of execution on offense did 
play a role in the team’s collapse.

But — if South Carolina’s 

defensive players are to be 
believed — Michigan’s issues 
weren’t just in execution. They 
laid in preparation, as well.

When asked if there was a 

moment where the Gamecocks’ 
defense felt they had solved 
the 
Wolverines, 
cornerback 

JaMarcus 
King 
gave 
an 

affirmative answer. He felt that 
way after Michigan’s first two 
drives.

“They gave us everything,” 

King said. “After that, we knew 
we could stop everything.”

Why? King felt the Wolverines 

were playing to their tendencies 
— running a lot of the same 
routes over and over again.

“The choice route where the 

receiver runs a mesh and the 
tight end runs a dig,” King said. 
“So they ran that probably 85 
percent of the time, and they ran 
a lot of stop routes on the back 
side.”

Given 
King’s 
answers, 

perhaps it should be no surprise 
that it was he who intercepted 
Peters on a third-and-goal from 
South Carolina’s five-yard line.

A mistake in judgement on 

Peters’ part, yes; the ball was 
clearly late. But what King saw 
on film had a lot to do with it.

Similar 
answers 
were 

provided 
by 
linebacker 
TJ 

Brunson and defensive tackle 
Javon Kinlaw.

Brunson knew from certain 

formations whether Michigan 
was going to run the ball and 
where the Wolverines would 
run it. He could also tell what 
to 
expect 
from 
personnel 

groupings. That allowed the 
defense to simply read their keys 
and “make plays, execute.”

“We got in the right calls in 

the right positions,” Brunson 
said, “and everyone executed for 
the most part.”

Similar to King, Kinlaw felt 

early on that his team held a 
clear advantage, even if the 
Gamecocks trailed by as much as 
16 points in the second half.

“I knew from the first play 

that we were going to win that 
game,” Kinlaw said. “I could tell 
from a physical standpoint.”

Calling Michigan’s offense 

predictable, Kinlaw — similar to 
Brunson — had an idea of when 
the Wolverines would run the 
ball and when Peters would drop 
back to pass.

As the game went on, he 

noticed something else as well 
— a change in Michigan’s body 
language.

“When I see body language 

switch, heads moping,” Kinlaw 
said, “that makes me want to 
turn it up even more.”

And by that point, it was 

clear that Michigan’s continued 
mistakes on offense had pulled it 
into a downward spiral it would 
not escape.

“If you have a guy beat 

mentally, a lot of good things can 
happen for you,” Kinlaw said.

“Probably 
when 
all 
the 

turnovers started happening — 
that’s when I feel like we had 
them mentally beat.”

Brandon Peters fails to impress in 
opportunity at the Outback Bowl

TAMPA, Fla. — Brandon Peters 

could have showed everyone why 
he deserves to start next season.

But when he had the chance 

to lead a game-winning drive in 
a New Year’s Day 
bowl game against 
an SEC opponent, 
he turned the ball 
over. Twice.

Late 
in 
the 

fourth quarter, he 
stood alone on the 
sideline, 
hands 

on his hips and 
kicking the dirt off 
his cleats. Kicker 
Quinn 
Nordin 

patted him on the shoulder 
first, and then punter Will Hart 
walked over as well. Just two 
minutes remained on the clock, 
but Michigan’s defense made 
another stop. Sophomore VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson came over to 
Peters, put his arms around him 
and spoke into his ear.

“It’s the last drive. C’mon. We 

need you,” Hudson said to Peters. 
“Just go out there and try your 
best.”

Peters trotted out, but four 

plays later threw his second 
interception of the fourth quarter. 
South Carolina took a knee, and 
time winded down.

Michigan lost the Outback 

Bowl, 26-19, and Peters lost 
his last chance to impress the 
coaches, media and fans before 
the offseason.

Peters finished the day with 

186 passing yards. He threw two 
interceptions and completed just 
20 of his 44 passes, more attempts 
than any Michigan quarterback 
threw in a game this season.

In light of the recent news 

about Shea Patterson’s transfer 
from Ole Miss to Michigan, Peters 
said earlier this week that the 
Outback Bowl could be his own 
“breakout game.” He compared 
Patterson’s transfer to Michigan 
to the likes of someone stealing 
something from your house — 
and Peters said he wouldn’t let it 
happen.

The Outback Bowl was Peters’ 

first audition, though, and it 
didn’t start out very well.

Peters went 11-for-23 in the 

first half for just 76 yards. The 
second half’s first drive seemed 
more promising — he went four-
for-four on a touchdown drive, 

completing 
deep 
passes, 

slants and fades 
to 
multiple 

receivers.

After 
the 

game, 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
said 
there 

were 
“some 

good” 
parts 

from 
Peters’ 

performance, 

but there were also some plays 
that he knew Peters would “like 
to have back.”

“He was battling just like the 

rest of the guys,” Harbaugh said. 
“There was some error there. 
A little too much at the wrong 
time.”

Even if Peters had put on 

an impressive performance, it 
wouldn’t have put next year’s 
quarterback battle to rest, but 
he would’ve at least provided 
some positive game film against 
a decent opponent — albeit not a 

great team in South Carolina — 
but a team with a winning record 
nonetheless.

“It does light a fire under me,” 

Peters said. “I want to be the best 
I can possibly be. I’ll just take 
everything that’s happened this 
year and learn from it and take it 
into next year and be better.”

In the next few weeks, Shea 

Patterson will join the team in 
Ann Arbor and start his Michigan 
career. With his move, the next 
quarterback competition of the 
Harbaugh era begins. Harbaugh 
has had one in each of his last 
three seasons, and 2018 won’t be 
any different.

Patterson, 
Peters 
and 

freshman 
Dylan 
McCaffrey. 

That’s what the quarterback 
competition looks like right 
now. One of them hasn’t played 
a collegiate snap, one of them 
struggled on the biggest stage 
yet and the other one led the 
SEC conference in passing yards 
halfway through the season.

Harbaugh said he wasn’t sure 

how much these bowl game 
performances 
impact 
those 

quarterback competitions, but if 
Peters turns out to be the starter 
next fall, it definitely won’t have 
to do with the bowl performance 
in Tampa.

“He was 

battling just 
like the rest of 

the guys.”

O

n the first day of 2018, 
the story of the 2017 
season played out for 

the Michigan football team.

Four 

months 
of 

frustration 
summed 
up 
in 
four 

quarters.

After 

returning 
just 
five 

starters — the 
fewest 
total 

in the nation 
— from a team 
that finished 10-3 a year ago, 
the inexperienced, yet talented, 
Wolverines set out on a mission 
to show the country that this 
wouldn’t be a rebuilding year. 

But that’s exactly what the 

season became for Michigan.

The Wolverines opened the 

Outback Bowl on a high note, 
as the defense forced a trio of 
three-and-outs and held South 
Carolina to just 13 yards in the 
first quarter. Redshirt junior 
defensive end Chase Winovich 
even recovered a fumble, as did 
freshman defensive back Ambry 
Thomas on special teams. 

But 
Michigan’s 
offense 

couldn’t take advantage of either 
opportunity, failing to reach 
the end zone despite starting 
at the Gamecocks’ 31-yard and 
46-yard lines, respectively. In 
both cases, redshirt freshman 
kicker Quinn Nordin hit a field 
goal to put the Wolverines on 
the board. 

Their 6-0 lead was just as 

unconvincing as their 4-0 start 
to the season. 

Back 
in 
September, 

Michigan’s double-digit wins 
over 
then-No. 
17 
Florida, 

Cincinnati, 
Air 
Force 
and 

Purdue were marred by a 
tendency to wait until late 
in the second half to put the 
game away, mainly due to 
the 
prevalence 
of 
mindless 

turnovers.

That should sound familiar. 

The difference is that the 
Wolverines still managed to put 
those games away.

The second quarter showed 

more stagnation, as Michigan’s 
defense kept South Carolina at 
bay while its offense struggled 
to move the ball. Nordin and 
Gamecock kicker Parker White 
traded 40-plus-yard field goals 
to make it, 9-3, at halftime. 

And at the end of October, the 

Wolverines had dropped to 6-2, 
with two reasonable victories 
over 
Indiana 
and 
Rutgers 

and two devastating losses to 
Michigan State and then-No. 2 
Penn State. 

Still, Michigan had control 

of its own destiny. As unlikely 
as it may have seemed, if the 
Wolverines won out — their 
stated goal at the time — a Big 

Ten championship berth could 
have been in the cards.

In 
the 
third 
quarter, 

Michigan began to make its 
move, scoring a 
touchdown on its 
first possession 
after the break. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
quarterback 
Brandon Peters 
put 
together 

a 
six-play, 

72-yard 
drive 

capped off by a 
one-yard 
rush 

from 
freshman 

fullback Ben Mason. 

On the very next series, 

redshirt 
junior 
linebacker 

Noah Furbush picked off South 
Carolina 
quarterback 
Jake 

Bentley and returned it 27 yards 

to the Gamecocks’ 27-yard line. 

The Wolverines had their 

chance to put the game away. 
But they only made it to the 

four-yard line. 

Junior 

running 
back 

Karan 
Higdon 

was 
stripped, 

and 
South 

Carolina 
pounced on the 
loose ball. 

“(We) 
gave 

up 
too 
many 

opportunities,” 
Higdon 
said. 

“We had them 

right where we wanted them. … 
We just didn’t capitalize.”

After that play, the momentum 

shifted 
dramatically. 
Aside 

from a 48-yard field goal from 
Nordin, it never swung back in 

Michigan’s direction. 

In November, the Wolverines 

beat Minnesota and Maryland 
handily. They were riding high 
at 8-2 with two games left to 
play. But down by just four 
points to then-No. 5 Wisconsin, 
Peters suffered a concussion 
and left in an ambulance.

Michigan lost that game, as 

well as its next game against 
then-No. 8 Ohio State, and 
finished the regular season 
with an 8-4 record.

Suffice to say, it wasn’t the 

ending 
the 
Wolverines 
had 

imagined.

By the end of the Outback 

Bowl, Michigan turned the 
ball over four more times. 
The 
Gamecocks 
scored 
20 

unanswered 
points. 
South 

Carolina, which entered the 
game as a seven-point underdog, 

went on to win by that margin 
instead in a 26-19 loss for the 
Wolverines.

In 
the 
fourth 
month 
of 

Michigan’s 2017 season — bowl 
month — the same problems 
that haunted it all year came 
to the forefront and sent the 
Wolverines into 2018 with a 
sour taste in their mouths.

“We have to finish games, 

and we just didn’t today,” said 
senior left tackle Mason Cole. 
“ … When things like that are 
happening, you’re just waiting 
for that big play on us to stop 
their momentum, and it just 
never really did.

“It’s tough, especially for 

younger guys. They handled 
it fine, but sometimes when 
things aren’t going your way, 
you get emotionally hijacked or 
whatnot, and it’s just a learning 
lesson. 
Obviously, 
we 
wish 

it went the other way, but it 
didn’t.”

And 
because 
it 
didn’t, 

Michigan has a long offseason 
ahead. Its young core, thrown 
into the fire this year, performed 
about as well as could have been 
expected. 

But 
the 
Wolverines 
have 

plenty of room to grow. They 
already know. 

Asked how long the bitter 

feeling of an 8-5 season will 
linger, Higdon cut to the chase: 
“Until we play Notre Dame.”

While the 2018 season opener 

is eight months away, he and his 
teammates have their work cut 
out for them.

“You gotta go into it now 

with a more serious approach 
because now we know we 
have real issues that we gotta 
fix,” 
Higdon 
said. 
“If 
we 

wanna be great and we wanna 
be a national championship 
contender, those are mistakes 
that we can’t have.”

Four quarters in 2018 and 

four months of 2017 showed 
Michigan there’s a lot to learn 
from a rebuilding year.

Simpson leads ‘M’ past Iowa in crucial road win

IOWA CITY 
— Throughout 

the season, the point guard 
position has been a source 
of limited production for the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team.

In 
their 
previous 
game, 

freshman 
Eli 
Brooks 
and 

sophomore 
Zavier 
Simpson 

combined for just two points 
on three shot attempts facing a 
far-inferior Jacksonville team.

But 
on 
Tuesday 
night, 

Simpson played the best game 
of his college career, tallying 
15 points and 7 assists to lead 
the Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 
13-3 overall) to a 75-68 win 
over Iowa (0-3, 9-7) at Carver-
Hawkeye Arena.

“We got after him a little 

bit after (Jacksonville),” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“He didn’t guard his man, and 
we challenged him to go out 
and play better. He’s that type 
of guy who need to bring it 
every night.

“He works in the gym so 

much to hit those 3s that we 
needed to have.”

Simpson’s productivity was 

joined by that of freshman 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers 
and 

sophomore center Jon Teske 
— three bench 
players 
that 

were 
key 

Tuesday night. 

Livers scored 

a career-high 13 
points, and filled 
in nicely on the 
defensive 
end 

guarding 
Iowa 

forward 
Tyler 

Cook. 

And 
with 

junior center Moritz Wagner 
still knocking off rust from 
a ankle injury, Teske was 
also effective in limiting the 

Hawkeyes’ frontcourt down the 
stretch.

“Our 
bench 
really 
was 

solid today because Moe and 
Duncan really didn’t have some 

of 
the 
things 

(they 
usually 

have 
today),” 

Beilein 
said. 

“Our bench was 
the 
difference 

today.”

The 
same 

could 
be 
said 

about 
the 

Wolverines’ 
shooting 
performance. 

Michigan shot 49 percent from 
the floor and knocked down 11 
triples — including eight in the 
first half.

“We shot so well tonight,” 

Beilein said. “If we missed some 
of those shots, I might have a 
different story to tell right now. 
But we played extraordinarily 
well as far as shooting the ball.” 

Despite the shooting boost, 

however, Michigan’s victory 
didn’t come easily. 

With just over 10 minutes to 

go, the Hawkeyes went on an 
11-3 run to close its deficit to 
just six. And after leading by as 
many as 18 points, the eeriness 
of Michigan’s collapse at Ohio 
State last month crept in.

“That’s all we talk about 

all season,” Livers said. “That 
we can’t come out here in the 
second half and let them come 
hit us. We’ve got to hit them 
before they hit us. I think that’s 

going to help us going forward 
in the season.”

But, fittingly, it was Simpson 

who 
stopped 
the 
bleeding. 

With a layup that beat the shot 
clock and an assist to senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, 
he 
sparked 
the 

Wolverines to a 9-0 stretch that 
put the possibility of another 
Big Ten loss out of question.

With 
an 
augmented 

command of the offense and a 
6-for-9 effort from the field, 
Simpson was instrumental in 
creating the ball movement 
Beilein 
previously 
said 

Michigan lacked with the Ohio 
native on the floor.

“We wanted him to see the 

floor better,” Beilein said, “and 
he did that tonight.”

But like Saturday, it was 

another slow start for the 
Wolverines, 
who 
coughed 

up five turnovers before the 
game’s first media timeout, 
including two traveling calls 
against 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward Charles Matthews.

But 
with 
the 
Hawkeyes 

struggling 
to 
find 
twine, 

Abdur-Rahkman and Simpson 
each knocked down a pair of 
3s to launch Michigan to a 
15-point 
advantage 
midway 

through the frame.

That would set the tone for 

eight made triples from six 
different Wolverines in the first 
half.

And 
with 
a 
62-percent 

shooting performance on 15 
assists, Michigan would take a 

49-36 lead into the break.

That 
was 
despite 
quiet 

performances 
from 
Wagner 

and fifth-year senior Duncan 
Robinson, who combined for just 
seven points in 29 minutes.

“(Wagner) is just not right,” 

Beilein said. “He was tender on 
the ankle, but now he’s fine. He 
just needs to get his rhythm back. 
... And I’m concerned about him 
because we need Moe Wagner.”

And for a few minutes in the 

first half, the Hawkeyes exploited 
Wagner’s uncharacteristic game. 
With an 11-0 run, Iowa closed its 
deficit to single-digits early into 
the second frame.

But just as he did later in the 

half, it was Simpson who ended 
the run, wiggling his way into 
the paint for an easy score.

Michigan finishes third at GLI 

DETROIT, Mich. — For a 

second straight contest, Michigan 
got off to a dismal start.

And in the second period 

for the second night in a row, 
a convenient bounce led to a 
freshman’s first college goal to 
bring the Wolverines within one.

This time, though, Michigan 

(8-8-2 overall, 3-5-2 Big Ten) 
sealed the deal, coming all the 
way back and then some.

Slightly under five minutes 

into the second period, senior 
defenseman Sam Piazza’s shot 
from the point slammed off the 
back wall to freshman forward 
Michael Pastujov, who slipped the 
puck into the bottom-right corner 
of the net.

One 
minute 
later, 
junior 

forward 
Cooper 
Marody 

redirected a cross-ice pass from 
senior forward Dexter Dancs 
behind Michigan State goaltender 
John Lethemon to tie the score at 
three.

To lead off the final stanza, 

senior 
defenseman 
Cutler 

Martin’s 
shot 
ricocheted 
off 

the back of Spartan defender 
Zach Osburn and past a helpless 
Lethemon, giving the Wolverines 
their first lead of the Great Lakes 
Invitational — one they would not 
relinquish.

Michigan claimed third place 

in the GLI for the second straight 
year with a 6-4 victory over the 
same opponent — Michigan State 
(8-11-1, 2-7-1) — as in 2017.

As 
usual, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

high-powered first line set the 
pace, especially Marody — who 
recorded his second career hat-
trick with his equalizer and then 
two third-period goals. Senior 
forward Tony Calderone assisted 
on all three of them, while Dancs 
registered one assist of his own.

It’s unlikely anyone would have 

seen this coming a couple hours 
before. Just 26 seconds after the 
intial puck drop, Spartan forward 
Taro Hirose scooted through 
Michigan’s defense and found 
the net to open the scoring. Four 
minutes later, forward Logan 
Lambdin 
tipped 
defenseman 

Carson Gatt’s shot into a wide-open 

net created when a Michigan State 
player collided with sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne — 
a goal which was reviewed for 
interference, but ultimately stood.

“Obviously it’s not the start we 

wanted,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “Twenty seconds into the 
game we get one behind and we 
get 2-0. … I thought we got a break 
after the first period just to regroup 
a little bit and just to have a chat.”

The first half-hour, while still 

ugly for the Wolverines, wasn’t 
quite the same nightmare it had 
been against Bowling Green the 
previous night, which had a 4-0 
lead 24 minutes into the bout. 
Michigan showed more life on 
offense, moved the puck and 
created decent chances.

Not surprisingly, that all led 

to better results Tuesday. Three 
minutes into the second period, 
sophomore 
forward 
James 

Sanchez halved the deficit with a 
flick from the left wing that caught 
the right side of the net. But two 
minutes after that, Sanchez was 
penalized for tripping, leading 
to a power-play goal by Patrick 
Khodorenko 
to 
restore 
the 

Spartans’ original lead.

Last night, Pearson bemoaned 

the fact his team couldn’t do much 
after bringing the game within one 
goal. Again, Tuesday was different. 
After Martin’s goal, Khodorenko 
was hit with a crucial major 
penalty for cross-checking.

With 
the 
man 
advantage, 

Michigan could do whatever it 
wanted for the next five minutes. 
Shots flew in from everywhere, but 
it was one in particular — a high 
wrister by Marody for his second 
goal — that carried the most 
influence.

Michigan State capitalized on a 

power-play of its own with a five-
on-three advantage to stay in the 
game. But Marody’s third salvo 
sealed the deal with four minutes 
remaining.

“I think that we just had more 

will tonight,” Martin said. “Our 
team, we’re not as skilled maybe 
as we were my freshman and 
sophomore year. This year we 
sometimes have to play a little 
grindier game. And just making 
sure we do that, holding each other 
accountable.”

Livers displays improved outside shooting at Iowa

Isaiah Livers caught the ball 

in rhythm as he has all season. 
He squared to the hoop and 
lifted with the same form he has 
all season. 

The difference? This time it 

went in. 

In a place Michigan hasn’t 

won in seven seasons, in an 
arena enlivened by Iowa’s quick 
6-0 spurt, Livers motioned to 
the now-silenced crowd and 
lifted his fingers to his lips. 

Shhhh.
The three-point stroke looked 

the same. The confidence from 
the freshman was brand new.

“From here on, it just makes 

me play with a chip on my 
shoulder,” Livers said. “I know 
what I can do. I know what 
I’m capable of. At first, I was 
second-thinking 
everything. 

There was always a second 
thought that I had, and I think 
that was holding me back early 
in the season. I think now I have 
a lot more confidence than I 
had.”

On 
the 
next 
possession, 

Livers caught a swing pass in 
the corner and faced the rim 
again. This time, with the calm 
of a skilled veteran, Livers 
offered a slight pump fake. His 
defender bought it, offering him 
a clear lane to an easy layup.

A disgruntled (to put it 

mildly) Fran McCaffery called 
timeout, but Michigan never 
slowed down on its way to a 
75-68 win at Iowa.

Coming into the game, Livers 

was shooting just 28 percent 
from 
beyond 
the 
arc 
and 

averaging just three points in 
his 12.1 minutes per game. 

Michigan coach John Beilein 

has long suggested Livers would 
eventually develop a long-range 
jumper; most Beilein-coached 
players do. For Livers, that 
shot is the key to unlocking 
the treasure trove of skills he 
possesses — offensively and 
defensively.

“Coach 
(Beilein) 
works 

with me after practices, every 
practice we work on my jump 

shot,” Livers said. “So I think 
(the key is) just having a positive 
mindset, and seeing the ball go 
through the basket.”

Throughout the season, much 

of Livers’ value has remained 
intangible — or at least less 
visible. 
Paired 

next to Wagner, 
Livers 
has 

often 
provided 

a 
necessary 

defensive 
upgrade at the 
other frontcourt 
position, 
and 

averages 
3.6 

offensive 
rebounds per 36 
minutes on the 
other end. Until Tuesday, his 
role had been clear and rigid.

But if his shot begins to 

drop — and he made each of his 
three attempts Tuesday — his 
potential now and in the future 
seems far greater.

“I think that I could be more 

of a Duncan Robinson,” Livers 
offered for how his role might 
change with a developed stroke. 

“I could shot fake, get the 
defender in the air, and I could 
go right past him and get to the 
bucket or make open passes for 
my teammates.”

But, of course, it was the stark 

difference between the skillsets 

of 
Livers 
and 

Robinson 
that 

told the tale of 
Tuesday’s win. 

Michigan was 

23 points better 
with Livers on 
the court than 
without. It was 
18 points worse 
with 
Duncan 

Robinson 
on 
the 
floor 

than 
without 
him. 
There’s 

correlation and causation; that 
is unmistakeably the latter.

Much of that can be attributed 

to the matchup problem with 
Robinson 
— 
a 
defensively-

challenged wing — guarding 
Iowa’s Tyler Cook.

Cook was a physical presence 

who gave Robinson and junior 
center Moritz Wagner problems 

all evening. With Robinson 
unable 
to 
handle 
Cook’s 

aggression, Beilein turned to 
Livers.

“Duncan 
Robinson 
is 
a 

mismatch ‘4’ that we don’t have 
another answer right now. DJ 
Wilson was the answer this 
year and he isn’t here this year,” 
Beilein said. “That’s hard for 
Duncan to guard some of these 
guys, so Duncan has been 
filling in and Isaiah should be 
playing more in the future. He 
has been working on that jump 
shot and his numbers are good 
in practice. He hasn’t done it 
in games, but maybe this is a 
breakthrough.”

Tuesday night was a glimpse 

into 
an 
ever-growing 
light 

at the end of Livers’ lengthy 
developmental 
tunnel. 
It’s 

unreasonable to expect Livers 
to fill the shoes of DJ Wilson 
right away, but the long-term 
comparison is not far-fetched.

With a newfound shot and 

growing confidence, there are 
sure to be more crowd-silencers 
down the road.

Report says Frey set to 
leave for Florida State

Greg Frey’s first stint in Ann 

Arbor lasted three years.

His second? That could be 

much shorter.

According to a report from 

Josh Newberg of 247Sports.com, 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
tackles 

and tight ends coach didn’t 
travel home with the team from 
Tampa after Monday’s Outback 
Bowl. Instead, Frey and his wife 
drove up to Tallahassee to meet 
with new Florida State head 
coach Willie Taggart.

Frey may not have coached 

alongside 
Taggart before, 
but 
he 
does 

have significant 
shared history 
with 
the 

Seminoles, 
having 
played 

for 
Florida 

State’s 
1993 

championship 
team.

The 
report 

implies 
Frey 

has been in ongoing talks with 
Taggart, who was officially 
hired Dec. 5.

According 
to 
Newberg, 

there’s a “good chance” Frey’s 
departure is finalized in the 
near future.

Such a move would represent 

a second consecutive offseason 
with a significant shake-up 
in 
the 
offensive 
coaching 

staff. Following last season, 
the Wolverines saw former 
assistant coaches Jedd Fisch 
and Tyrone Wheatley leave for 
jobs elsewhere. Jim Harbaugh 
brought in Frey as one of 
the replacements along with 
passing game coordinator Pep 
Hamilton.

He was seen as a key cog in 

the development of Michigan’s 
offensive line, joining offensive 
coordinator Tim Drevno, who 

was responsible for interior 
linemen.

Frey, an acclaimed coach who 

has developed numerous NFL-
caliber linemen such as Taylor 
Lewan, Jason Spriggs and Dan 
Feeney throughout stops at four 
different schools, also served 
as the Wolverines’ run game 
coordinator.

Known as a dogged recruiter, 

Frey was responsible for signing 
Jalen Mayfield and Ryan Hayes, 
two four-star offensive tackles, 
and 
Luke 
Schoonmaker, 
a 

three-star tight end, in the 2018 
class.

In 
his 
one 

year 
on 
staff, 

Michigan 
experienced 
mixed 
results 

along 
the 

offensive 
line. 

The Wolverines 
struggled 
with 

pass protection, 
especially 
on 

the 
right 
side 

of 
the 
line, 

where Michigan 

started three different players 
at right tackle. The Wolverines 
surrendered 36 total sacks, 
ranking No. 114 in the nation.

The 
rushing 
attack 
saw 

more positive results, although 
the Wolverines limped to the 
finish. In their final three 
games (all losses), they rushed 
a combined 115 times for 232 
yards, averaging 2.0 yards per 
carry. On the year, Michigan 
averaged 177.7 rushing yards 
per game. According to the 
S+P ratings, the Wolverines’ 
rushing attack ranked No. 14 in 
the nation.

During 
Frey’s 
previous 

tenure, Michigan’s offensive 
line 
play 
improved 
quickly 

enough that he was able to see 
the fruits of his labor. That 
doesn’t appear to be the case 
this time around. 

Shea Patterson can’t fix Michigan on his own

T

AMPA, Fla. — A procla-
mation came from the 
first row of Raymond 

James Sta-
dium.

“It’s Pat-

terson sea-
son,” one fan 
screamed 
in Brandon 
Peters’ direc-
tion.

And thus, 

the prover-
bial cloud 
hanging over 
the redshirt freshman’s head 
became very, very literal.

He stood on the sideline, hel-

met perched upon his head.

He was a lonely man, playing 

one of football’s loneliest posi-
tions. He had just gone four-and-
out with four incompletions, 
the Michigan football team’s 
penultimate gasp in a 26-19 loss 
to South Carolina in the Outback 
Bowl.

Little did he know his world 

was about to get a whole lot 
lonelier. His defense gave him a 
final chance at playing hero. He 
would throw his second pick of 
the game, on 4th-and-1, to seal 

the win for the Gamecocks once 
and for all. Then he would trot 
off the field accompanied only by 
Sean McKeon.

So yes, it well may be ‘Patter-

son season.’ The former Ole Miss 
quarterback is officially in Ann 
Arbor, set to enroll in classes 
and begin offseason workouts 
while he awaits the fate of his 
eligibility.

But here’s the rub: Shea Pat-

terson can’t fix Michigan’s prob-
lems.

After the game, asked what 

was necessary for the program 
to get to the next level, Jim Har-
baugh offered little clarity and 
no specificity.

“We’ll look at every aspect 

of it,” he said, “and we’ll make 
improvements.”

Not long after, Karan Higdon 

was asked to summarize Michi-
gan’s 8-5 season.

“I think it’s definitely a learn-

ing season,” he said. “We learned 
a lot about ourselves, a lot about 
our program, a lot about our 
coaches, our players, and I think 
going into next year we’ve got to 
put it all together. … We’ve gotta 
capitalize on those things and fix 
the little things as well.”

The problem is that Michigan 

certainly has improvements to 
make, but they’re not a matter of 
the “little things,” as the issues 
have been described all season.

And despite the Wolverines’ 

optimism with each passing 
week that they were one step 
away from a 
breakthrough, the 
fact remains that 
they’re not.

That doesn’t 

change that, in the 
week leading up 
Monday’s match-
up, the consensus 
was rather simple.

A matchup with 

the Gamecocks 
was an opportu-
nity for progress, a springboard 
for 2018.

But given a month to prepare, 

it was anything but. And the 
evidence was strung across four 
quarters in Raymond James 
Stadium.

Near the seven-minute mark 

of the second quarter, freshman 
Brad Robbins was replaced with 
Will Hart after hitting three 
of his first four punts under 35 
yards, only to be reinstated on 

the next fourth down when Hart 
hit a line drive himself.

With just over nine minutes 

left in the third quarter, Higdon 
fumbled inside the five-yard line 
with a chance to put the Wolver-
ines up by 19.

Then came the fumble on 

Michigan’s 
own 21-yard 
line and 
the 17-point 
onslaught 
that gave the 
Gamecocks the 
lead and the 
two intercep-
tions.

All the 

while, the 
Wolverines 

relied on their kicker to generate 
points and watched as a make-
shift offensive line that is largely 
indicative of the future was 
manhandled.

If this all sounds familiar, it’s 

probably because it happened in 
Arlington against Florida, too.

As for the cherry on top?
Asked how long it took South 

Carolina to figure out Michigan’s 
offense, cornerback JaMarcus 
King left things pretty plainly.

“Two drives.”
Taking that all into account, it 

may be time for fans to prepare 
for a tough reality.

Shea Patterson can beat a 

defense with his legs. As things 
stand, he isn’t fast enough to 
make up for his offensive line.

He has a pretty arm, but won’t 

produce 300-yard outings if his 
offense is predictable.

He has a fanbase hungry for 

him, hungry for a savior.

But they felt that way about 

Peters, too, not so long ago. And 
the same problems that undid 
him remain, leaving Michigan 
in a bit of a conundrum.

The Wolverines have a lot to 

fix themselves. Shea Patterson 
can’t do it for them.

Freshmen perform 
 

well in Greensboro

The Greensboro Aquatic 

Center is a considerable 591 
miles away from Ann Arbor. 
It’s not a stretch to say that 
most other visiting divers 
would feel like a fish out of 
water there.

However, two freshmen 

divers for the No. 4 Michigan 
women’s 
swimming 
and 

diving team, Nikki Canale 
and 
Christy 
Cutshaw, 

had their own home-pool 
advantage while competing at 
the 2017 USA Diving Winter 
National 
Championships 

in their home 
state of North 
Carolina.

Over 
the 

course of the 
six-day 
meet 

from 
Dec. 

13-18, 
Canale 

and 
Cutshaw 

both 
finaled. 

Cutshaw 
finished 
second in the 
synchronized 
platform and sixth in the 
platform, 
while 
Canale 

placed eleventh in the three-
meter final. Diving coach 
Mike Hilde attributed some 
of the divers’ performance 
to 
being 
in 
familiar 

territory, but was impressed 
nonetheless.

“I know that they were 

excited 
that 
friends 
and 

family were in town and 
there 
were 
people 
there 

to 
support 
them,” 
Hilde 

said. “It was kind of a rare 
occasion because there’s not 
a lot of times where you’re in 
a place that you’re from. But 
it was a great experience. My 
two freshmen divers were 
competing at a high level … 
both ended up in the finals 
and both did pretty well.”

Hilde also highlighted the 

freshmen’s toughness in the 
face of adversity. Many of 

the divers at the meet were 
upperclassmen or divers who 
were already out of college, 
while this was Canale and 
Cutshaw’s 
first 
collegiate 

dive of such high stakes.

“They’re young girls and 

are new to the college scene,” 
Hilde said. “Not everybody in 
this meet was a college diver 
but a majority of them are 
or were graduating divers, 
so just to see their mental 
toughness And the way they 
handle themselves was the 
main thing. They’re battling 
with the best so it’s also a 
very good positive motivator 
going forward.”

The divers 

will 
return 

home 
to 

Canham 
Natatorium on 
Jan. 13, where 
both the men’s 
and women’s 
swimming 
and 
diving 

programs will 
host Indiana. 
As the meet 
will 
mark 

the women’s program’s first 
home meet since Sept. 29, 
Hilde is looking forward 
to seeing the team rallying 
around each other and the 
Wolverine community.

“They 
can 
stay 
home, 

continue to train and study 
without leaving their own 
place and going back and 
forth,” 
Hilde 
said. 
“It 

changes the way because we 
don’t have too many meets 
coming up, and you can really 
get into the rhythm for what 
we want to get done at the Big 
Ten’s. You’re not away from 
all your peers and fellow 
athletes to rally around, so 
it’s nice to have that chunk of 
time back home.”

For Cutshaw and Canale 

though, that chunk was just 
a bit longer, and all the more 
triumphant.

‘M’ falls to Iowa as Thome, Flaherty struggle

Michigan 
had 
all 
the 

momentum in the world. 

The No. 21 Wolverines (1-1 Big 

Ten, 12-3 overall) fought back 
from a nine-point deficit with 
five minutes to go in the game 
to make it two with just under 
four minutes left. The No. 23 
Hawkeyes (2-0, 14-1), proceeded 
to slam the door shut with more 
force than the Incredible Hulk.

Iowa’s Chase Coley hit an 

elbow jumper to make the lead 
four. Kathleen Doyle put in a 
transition layup to extend it to 
six, then added another layup off 
a backdoor cut to make it eight. 
When Megan Gustafson beat the 
shot clock to make it 10 with 1:21 
to go, that was all she wrote.

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team fell on Sunday, 
82-72, at Carver-Hawkeye Arena 
in Iowa City. The loss snaps an 
eight-game winning streak and 
keeps coach Kim Barnes Arico 
from passing Sue Guevara for 
first place on the program’s all-

time wins list. 

Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 

managed to put up 24 points 
on 8-of-19 shooting, spurring 
Michigan’s fourth-quarter run 
with six straight points. However, 
she was the only Wolverine with 
more than 11 points on the night.

“I 
thought 

we had a couple 
opportunities 
of some other 
people to make 
plays, 
whether 

that be getting 
stops 
on 
the 

defensive 
end, 

or even on the 
offensive 
end 

with the defense 
they 
were 

playing, denying Katelynn and 
denying (Nicole) Munger a little 
bit,” Barnes Arico told WTKA. 
“But we really couldn’t get too 
many other people going.

“I thought Kayla Robbins did a 

decent job of giving us some real 
good minutes as she’s done the 
last couple of games. But other 
than that, we really struggled to 

get going.”

The Hawkeyes managed to 

keep the Wolverines quiet with 
a triangle-and-two defense that 
flummoxed them.

“They 
face-guarded 

Katelynnn 
and 
face-guarded 

Nicole and we really weren’t able 

to get them any 
open 
looks 
the 

rest of the game,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said. “We really 
struggled 
with 

that. And I would 
imagine 
that’s 

how teams are 
probably 
gonna 

defend us, so we 
gotta 
continue 

working on that.”

The game was decided down 

low. Gustafson, who averages 
22.1 points and 12.6 rebounds 
per game for Iowa, lived up to 
her billing. She finished with 27 
points and 11 rebounds on 8-of-9 
shooting from the field, getting 
junior center Hallie Thome into 
foul trouble early and spending 
the rest of the game scoring over 

double-teams. 

“I thought we did a great job in 

the first half of really crowding 
(Gustafson),” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think some of their other role 
players made a couple shots and 
I think that made our kids a little 
bit nervous, to come on out and to 
guard some of them. When they 
did, that really opened things up 
for Gustafson.”

Thome herself was shut down 

by Gustafson and the rest of 
Iowa’s defense. Despite the foul 
trouble, she played 31 minutes, but 
managed just seven points, her 
second-worst mark of the season.

Michigan has, for the most 

part, spent the season feasting on 
non-conference opponents, their 
only two losses coming against 
two top-three teams. On Sunday, 
it learned the hard way that the 
competition in the Big Ten, on 
the road, is a good deal tougher.

“Welcome to the Big Ten,” 

Barnes Arico said. “Where every 
night, if you’re not focused, if 
you’re not locked in, if you’re not 
ready to go for 40 minutes, you 
can be beat.”

Hustled Out

Union renovations strip 

away 97 years of pool hall 

history


L

ike every good story, mine 
comes with a cup of coffee — 
an Americano with no room, 
to be exact.

As I start my final semester at the 

University, finishing two degrees and 
leading up to what is probably my 2,190th 
cup of coffee (365 days x 4 years x 1.5 
cups on average), I’ve come to appreciate 
the coffee shop culture in Ann Arbor. 
It’s contributed to the way I feel a part 
of the Ann Arbor community — aspiring 
journalists, 
novelists, 
physicians, 

researchers and artists alike.

It goes without saying I am mildly 

addicted to coffee — not to caffeine 
— but to the bitter taste of espresso that 
stains my teeth and accounts for the 
majority of my dental bill. Before I leave 
the University and the city that has now 
become my home, I’ve made a promise 
to myself to explore, to the best of my 
abilities and schedule, the coffee hubs that 
make up Ann Arbor.

Coffee is never just coffee. It’s never just 

a buzz, an alternative to caffeine pills, a 
natural laxative or a conversation starter. 
It’s so much more than the full-bodied 
taste of freshly ground coffee beans. It’s 
an experience. When I drink coffee, it 
rarely comes without sentimentality.

I’ve realized — because this is what 

my nostalgic senior-year mind does in 
its spare time — each chapter of my life 
comes with a different coffee drink. Soy 
chai latte when I was in middle school, 
exploring the world and realizing there 
was more than plain milk, matcha latte 
after I left Japan for boarding school in the 
U.S.; skim latte when I copied everything 
my mom did; dirty chai in high school; and 
right now I take everything black because 
I like that it makes me feel like an adult. 
(No, I genuinely like the way it tastes.)

A vast majority of these early coffee 

epiphanies were rooted in a Starbucks. 
Yes, maybe it is heresy to write about 
Starbucks in a coffee column — I do 
prefer independent local coffee shops to 
massive chains any day. But it happens 
to be that some of my best and hardest 
memories came with coffee and a green, 
two-tailed mermaid.

There’s one Starbucks my mom and I 

went to near our home in Kobe, Japan. 
Japanese Starbucks stores aren’t much 
different from the ones in the United 
States. The drinks seem smaller because 
they are rigorous with measuring the 
exact amount of milk and syrup (the 
drinks never overflow with whip cream 
like they do in the U.S.) and are generally 
more expensive, and they have different 
seasonal features like white chocolate 
green tea lattes instead of pumpkin 
spice. The merchandise is different and 
of course, the people are different. But if 
you close your eyes, you could hardly tell 
the difference.

It still has that bold smell of roasted 

coffee beans with a slightly sour aftertaste 
that clings to your nose. There is the flutter 
of silverware and plates that occasionally 
make it hard to hear conversation, and the 
intermittent loud steam from the copper-
colored espresso machine. No matter 
what time of day or day of the year, it is 
never empty. Eight times out of ten, there’s 
a stroller parked in the store somewhere. 
There is a flux of chatter and a warmth 
that makes it feel cozy, even if it is an 
outpost of an 85 billion dollar enterprise.

The Starbucks my mom and I go to is a 

part of a small mall that faces the Hanshin 
train station. It has floor-to-ceiling 
windows on one side so light fills the store 
during the day. The Hanshin train runs 
above ground and you can see it pull into 
the station above the buildings. We watch 
the flurry of people walk out of the station 
as the train leaves. Sometimes a truck 
pulls by the window to drop off loaves of 
bread and pastries to the bakery next door.

We always sit at the table furthest from 

the windows, I don’t know why. We sit at 
the same table close to the exit, where we 
can still see the train but also the other 
stores inside. It’s close to the pick-up 
counter so there is usually a barista close 
by. The table with honey and cinnamon is 
always behind me, on my left shoulder.

We laugh about it now, how much 

has changed since we first sat in that 
Starbucks at that same table. We held 
hands and cried over our half-eaten 
blueberry scone as I tried to digest the 

recurrence of her cancer. I remember 
being nauseated from anxiety when I 
thought I wouldn’t be able to continue 
school in the U.S. because of my visa. We 
talked only paperwork over our drinks. 
After my ACL surgery, I hobbled on 
crutches to the same table and watched 
my mom carry our drinks — I had to sit 
on the other side because I couldn’t bend 
my knee, I thought my world was ending. 
When I decided on U-M, we were both 
so happy we finished our drinks and 
food the fastest I’ve seen yet. We’ve seen 
baristas come and go and the wallpaper 
painted, retouched and finally changed. 
We sit, holding hands across the same 
table, talking about my dreams, her 
future, the hypothetical grandkids and 
mother-daughter book tour.

We’ve cried and laughed at the table, her 

over a skim latte, and me over a constantly 
changing drink. She is my constant — of 
course she is, she’s my mom. But in some 
ways, so is Starbucks.

I like that I can drink the same drink 

with her at our table by the barista, 
watching the train pull into the station, 
and in the Michigan Union during 
midterms. I like that I can order a grande 

or venti Americano in Kobe and be 
reminded of it when I traveled to Portugal 
for a writing conference. I like that I can 
drink that same coffee as I talk about my 
post-grad plans with professors I admire. 
I like that I can eat a blueberry scone 
in Japan and in Ann Arbor and know it 
tastes the same, even if I’m breathing 
different air on different soil. I like that I 
can simultaneously feel at home and part 
of so many different worlds.

And maybe that’s what’s unique about 

a global enterprise like Starbucks. Less 
the quirky types of coffee beans and 
picture-worthy foam art, but more the 
unique ability it has to spread and blend 
experiences.

I 
can 
still 
remember 
the 
first 

Strawberries & Creme Frappuccino I 
ordered after a dance competition in Los 
Angeles, when I was eight or so. When I 
drink an Americano now, in Kobe or Ann 
Arbor, so much has changed. I realize 
I’ve come further than I would’ve ever 
thought, that the world has changed 
tenfold and the future is even more 
unpredictable.

It’s so much more than just coffee, it 

always is.

Soundtracking: Writer’s block

S

o I may or may not have 
stared at a blank Google Doc 
page for hours on end trying 
to write this column. I don’t 

consider this column about not being 
able to think of a column “phoning it in.”

I consider it making the most out 

of what I was given — which was a 
laptop, a deadline and early 2000s bops 
floating around in my brain.

Between my essay-steeped course 

load, working at The Daily, drafting 
plays and scenes and attempting to 
record some songs every 
now and again, it’s safe to 
say I write a lot. I have to. As 
someone who can barely say 
two words without making a 
fool of himself or cracking a 
half-baked joke to get out of 
an awkward conversation, 
writing gives me something 
physical to grasp onto. You 
can take your time when 
you’re writing. The language 
can flow onto the page in 
one swift breeze but you 
have the ability to go back 
and comb through the word 
vomit. You can’t go back and 
revise a conversation; this 
isn’t 
the 
fun-for-all-ages 

comedy “Click” starring the 
immaculate Adam Sandler.

Sometimes 
when 
I’m 

writing, I feel as though 
I’m 
drunk. 
I 
blink 
and 

words suddenly appear on 
my page. I feel this way 
right now. Sometimes your 
drunken stints of text turn 
into 
complete 
and 
utter 

garbage. You look back and 
think, “What the hell was I 
thinking?”

All Bad — J.I.D ft. Mereba
But sometimes you strike gold. On 

rare occasions, you reread your work 
and it isn’t the worst shit you’ve ever 
seen. It could even be good like when 
you play “Tipsy Chef” and become the 
Gordon Ramsey of drunk food — I still 
stand by my pretzels and chocolate 
milk combo and I will never change.

I surprise myself a lot. Like for 

instance, I’m genuinely shook that I’ve 
been able to write this much. It took 
quite awhile.

Here’s your daily dose of Julie 

Andrews:

“Let’s start at the very beginning, a 

very good place to start”

No Title — Corbin
The title is arguably the hardest part 

of writing for me. I have trouble starting 
a piece if the title is blank. I also have 
trouble condensing something I’ve 
just finished drafting into a short title 

that represents the entire work. Like 
how the hell do people come up with 
autobiography titles? You’re basically 
writing your own epitaph. You’re 
summarizing the story of your life in a 
max of five words.

Mine 
would 
probably 
be 
“So 

White 
You 
Need 
Sunglasses: 
An 

Autobiography.”

After wracking my brain for an hour 

or so on this column, looking through 
my Spotify for songs and scrolling 
through Facebook because I’m weak, I 

decide I need to get out of the house.

I can’t write at home. Some find 

solace in the familiar. I’d rather be at 
a coffee shop or somewhere in public 
so I feel bad if people see me scrolling 
through a news feed or reading an 
article on David Bowie’s 100 favorite 
novels when I should be working.

I hop in my car and drive. I need to 

get far enough away from home where 
it will be too long of a drive home if the 
column isn’t done. A coffee shop is ideal. 
As I drive with no specific destination 
in mind, I pass by the primary example 
of cookie-cutter chain coffee shops. 
I can’t say the specific one here but 
let’s just say it rhymes with Barbucks. 
No one will be any the wiser. I am not 
about to stop there.

Fuck the Industry — Solange
I keep going until I remember my 

favorite little spot in metro Detroit. 

It’s about 15 minutes away from my 
house but worth the hike. Amazing 
and cheap coffee, huge reading room, 
comfy chairs, a portrait of George 
Washington in the bathroom — what 
else could I ever need? I pull up, park 
and head inside to find the reading 
room completely empty. 10/10 for this 
idea.

Many afternoons have been spent 

taking 
friends 
around, 
ultimately 

stopping here for an hour or two to talk 
around our mugs, read, write, play card 

games or do whatever our caffeine-
fueled hearts desired.

I’ve never been disappointed by the 

confines of this coffee shop.

Never Let me Down — Kanye West 

ft. Jay-Z and J. Ivy

Upon arriving, I think I’ll be able to 

crank out this column in no time.

Wrong. Dead wrong.
My fingers rest on the keys. I never 

learned how to really type with all 
fingers so the position feels awkward. 
I close my eyes and expect ideas to 
flow from my brain to my hands to the 
keyboard to the screen. Instead, I can’t 
get the image of a specific music video 
out of my head.

I remember watching this video on 

VH1’s “Top 20 Countdown” for a couple 
weeks. If I had to say so, I’d say it was 
a certified bop. It slaps. It bangs. Every 
word you can think of to describe a 

jam, this song fits the bill. It’s all I can 
think of. My column ideas go out one 
ear and this tune goes in the other.

I regret nothing.
The Sweet Escape — Gwen Stefani 

ft. Akon

Akon’s refrain and Gwen’s “woohoo, 

yeehoo” won’t leave me alone. I can’t 
focus on the column.

I rely on my coffee to drive me 

through and actually help me escape 
“The Sweet Escape.” I need that 
extra jolt to push my brain cells away 

from 2006 Gwen Stefani 
and towards my column 
deadline. When I go to buy 
a cup, the woman behind 
the register waves me away 
when I try to pay.

“The register’s on the 

fritz. You’re all good,” she 
says.

My 
heart 
melts. 
Free 

coffee? I take this to be a 
sign of some power greater 
than my understanding. If 
this safe haven of literature 
and caffeine can grace me 
with free coffee, I can finish 
this column. When I sit back 
down, I close my eyes once 
again. This time, I feel that 
drunken haze I get when 
a writing storm is brewing 
start to fall over me. I am 
ready to get to work.

Liberation 
— 
SiR 
ft. 

Anderson .Paak

Ultimately, 
the 
coffee 

and the unwavering stare 
from George Washington’s 
portrait peering through the 
open bathroom door drive 
me to finish this piece. It is 
not my proudest work but it 
is also not the worst piece of 

writing I have ever attached my name 
to.

In conclusion, my recommendation, 

as the textbook-definition of a rookie 
writer, would be if you ever suffer 
from writer’s block, here’s what you 
need to do:

Get away from where you sleep. 

Writing in bed will break the crucial 
gap between home and work, which is 
no good in my book.

Something to drink gives you a quick 

reprieve from thinking. Be it coffee, 
water, alcohol or anything in between, 
raising a glass to your lips physically 
stops you from writing and can be the 
perfect pause you need before you dive 
back in.

Always keep a portrait of George 

Washington handy. It’s something 
about the eyes that says “Keep 
writing, asshole.”

The pool hall, hustled out

Union renovations strip away 97 years of pool hall history 

by Will Feuer, Contributor
T

he room is a labyrinth of 
ancient tables, antiques still 
in use. Above each one, fluo-
rescent lights puncture maize 

and blue stained glass to reflect off the phe-
nolic resin balls. Blue cue chalk stains the 
hands of the players and permeates the air 
to create a haze. Chatter is drowned out by 
the smack of balls. The archaic space heat-
ers moan and the greats who came before 
us stand watch, framed in timeless wood, 
nailed to the walls. The scratches and tears 
in the 16 nine-foot Brunswick tables tell a 
story longer than most at the University of 
Michigan have been alive.

Few people know that when the Michi-

gan Union was erected in 1919, it boasted a 
bowling alley, bar, swimming pool, barber 
shop, hotel rooms and much more. Over the 
century since, these amenities have slowly 
been replaced by a computer lab, Starbucks, 
Au Bon Pain, fast food chains and other 
facilities that fill today’s Union. However, 
one room on the second floor remains vir-
tually untouched, frozen in time and dis-
playing the Union’s winding story. As this 
academic year ends, so too will the lingering 
life of the historic billiards hall.

I spent hours every week — probably 

every day — in this room my freshman 
year. It is where I would unwind after a 
long day and where I would bring people to 
understand me a bit more. The green-felted 
nine-foot Brunswick tables put the ratty 
seven-footer my dad taught me to play on to 
shame. This is my refuge, my paradise and 
my home.

It wasn’t long before I was on the club 

pool team. Yes, U-M has a team. In fact, U-M 
hosts the largest college pool tournament 
in the country, the University of Michigan 
Team Pool Championships. My freshman 
year, the UMTPC was the weekend of Hal-
loween. While my fraternity brothers were 
doing what they do, I was locked in a heated 
game of nine-ball until midnight against a 
couple of students from Carnegie Mellon 
University. I lost, we shook hands and they 
asked me where the parties were.

That tournament is held every year, and 

it’s bliss for those of us who crave the inten-
sity of calmly tapping safety shots for two 
hours patiently awaiting a chance to run the 
table in one foul devastating swoop.

OK, so it’s not football, but what pool 

lacks in aggression and physicality, it makes 
up for tenfold in strategy and tact. Though 
far and few in between, there is a network 
of individuals on campus who don’t just love 
billiards but love the billiards hall. That’s 
why I question the Union renovations slated 
to begin this April, which will not only erase 
the pool hall entirely but also devastate the 
community surrounding it.

*****

When the Union closes for renovations 

this spring, the University will sink more 
than $85 million into the project over 
two years. In planning the new and hope-
fully improved Union, the University 
conducted surveys, town halls, intercept 
interviews and more to gauge campus 
and alumni opinion on what the Union 
should be. In total, more than 350 stu-

dents, 500 alumni and almost 200 staff 
offered input.

Driven by the results of those outreach 

efforts, the administration is seeking to 
expand space for student organizations in 
the Union, said Susan Pile, senior director of 
University Unions and Auxiliary Services, 
who has been active in planning the renova-
tions. The University currently boasts over 
1,500 student organizations, but fewer than 
80 have office space, all of which is located 
on the third and fourth floors of the Union.

While creating office space for student 

organizations, the renovations will expand 
Counseling and Psychological Services 
and move some administrative offices to 
the third and fourth floors. The student 
org offices will move to the “IdeaHub,” 
a planned co-working space that will be 
available to all 1500 student organizations. 
However, if demand is high, space may 
become reservation-only.

What is certain is that the IdeaHub will 

take over the space that has been the billiards 
hall for 97 years, which has failed to turn a 
profit in the past decade according to Pile.

“I think folks recognize that we are trying 

to create a much more inclusive kind of space 
for student organizations,” Pile said. “We are 
going to maintain the historical details of the 
space and we will tell the story of the billiards 
room in the space to honor that legacy.”

The concept behind the IdeaHub origi-

nated in 2011 from the student-run Building 
a Better Michigan, formed by the Michigan 
Union Board of Representatives to advocate 
for improvements to the Union. BBM has 
significantly contributed to the Union ren-
ovation process, communicating directly 
with the project’s architects. 

“One thing that BBM really does is it 

helps keep the renovations in a student-led 
perspective because the University would 
not exist had it not been for students here,” 
LSA junior Jazz Teste said, a co-president 
of BBM.

In 2013, members of BBM spoke before 

the Board of Regents, claiming to repre-
sent all 17,000 LSA students despite being 
unelected. The Regents then voted to add 
a semesterly $65 “University Unions and 
Recreational Sports facility improvement 
fee” onto the tuition and fees of students 
to go towards renovating campus facilities, 
formally putting the gears in motion for the 
Union overhaul.

“I do regret having to lose the billiards 

room because it is a gorgeous and iconic 
place in the Union. However, student lei-
sure activities have changed over the past 
couple decades,” Teste said.

Teste said it’s unfair for the University 

to pick and choose which student groups 
receive the limited office space, and reiter-
ated the billiards hall has been unprofit-
able. The IdeaHub will eliminate the need 
to parcel out space among eager student 
organizations.

“It would come down to evaluating 

them, which we currently do, but how 
do you measure someone’s passion over 
another?” she asked.

Being that it is precisely the administra-

tion’s job with these renovations, I put the 
question to those who care most about the 
billiards hall.

*****

“This place for me was one of my favorite 

places on campus. It’s where I spent most of 
my free time. I fell in love with pool and met 
a lot of really cool people here,” Greg Web-
ster said, who graduated from LSA in 2016.

“I met my girlfriend here,” he added with 

a bashful smile.

Webster is a self-proclaimed follower 

of “The Dude” from “The Big Lebowski,” 
though he’s replaced The Dude’s passion for 
bowling with that of pool. His long blonde 
hair and signature goatee are a testament 
to his aesthetic, even if the Union doesn’t 
allow White Russian cocktails. Webster can 
be found in the pool hall almost everyday. 
He is one of the first people I met at the Uni-
versity. In my freshman year, he convinced 
me to try out for the team.

“It is what it is. I’ve kind of accepted 

the fact that it’s going to be removed from 
the building … They’re already looking to 
sell everything,” he said in classic “Dude-
esque” fashion.

According to Pile, the University will 

seek out other homes on campus for the 
tables before trying to sell them off.

Webster understands the hall has been 

unprofitable for at least a decade, but he 
believes there’s value in the room that the 
administration fails to see.

“If you come in here during the day, you 

see people from all over the world coming to 
play and you hear people speaking all types 
of languages … Most of my friends who I 
spend hours a week playing pool with are 
from Asia. I’ve even learned some Chinese. 
I could go to a pool hall in China and be able 
to speak to them a bit,” he explained.

Webster was speaking not just about the 

pool hall, but also to a much broader global 
trend. While the once-hugely popular game 
of billiards has steadily declined in the Unit-
ed States, the sport has taken off throughout 
Asia, particularly China. At the turn of the 
20th century, New Yorkers enjoyed more 

than 4,000 billiards rooms. Today, there are 
fewer than 30.

Shanghai was home to 200 billiards clubs 

in 2008, a number that has since skyrock-
eted to 1,500. Pool academies have been 
established in major cities throughout Asia 
and today, six of the top 10 global pool play-
ers are from East or Southeast Asia, accord-
ing to the World Pool-Billiard Association.

“(The University) is trying to create all 

these ‘global citizens,’ but then they get 
rid of every sport that’s not ‘American,’” 
Webster said. “This is where you’re able 
to connect with people who you wouldn’t 
normally connect with through this shared 
interest in pool. This is where our cultures 
meet and we’re able to bond over it.”

Mengyang Zhang, who graduated last 

fall from the School of Engineering, echoed 
that point. Zhang hails from the province 
of Shanxi in China, and transferred to the 
University three years ago from North Car-
olina State University. Discovering the pool 
hall his first week on campus, the tight-knit 
community helped him adjust.

Zhang went on to represent the Univer-

sity at the UMTPC for three consecutive 
years, also competing every year to qualify 
for the Association of College Unions Inter-
national Collegiate 9-Ball Championship. As 
a founding member of ACUI, the University 
has hosted their billiards tournaments doz-
ens of times, and this past summer they did 
so again, knowing it would be the last in Ann 
Arbor. Zhang placed in the top 16, but his 
favorite part of the game is the relationships.

“Pool is a common interest for everyone 

who comes here, so from the pool, we then 
start talking about life and get to know each 
other, different lifestyles and cultures. It’s 
the start of the conversation,” he said over a 
game of eight ball.

The University’s billiards club is the first 

club Zhang joined on campus and three years 
later, he still attends almost every weekly 
meeting, loosely defining the term “meeting.” 
Members of the billiards club convene every 
Friday evening in the hall for a tournament. 
The winner gets a free week of pool. Though 
Zhang said he only competes to win when he 
is feeling really good, he enjoys being with all 
of his friends and afterward, they’ll go out for 
dinner or a drink.

“If it’s possible, I definitely want this 

pool hall to be kept. All my memories, all 
the people I know, it all started here. Even 
if they just move some to another room, if I 
see one of the tables I can pick up the memo-
ries maybe,” he said. “This is where all my 
memories are. There’s a story here.”

*****

The billiards hall has welcomed numer-

ous professionals over the years, including 
Hall of Famer Nick Varner, and the legend-
ary Mike Massey. But perhaps today’s most 
famous patron of the pool hall is Betsy 
Sundholm, manager of the Student Organi-
zation Resource Center. Sundholm came to 
the University as a freshman and hasn’t left 
since. She became a full-time employee of 
the Union in 1996. Not only is she friendly 
with every regular, student and non-student 
alike, but she has also created a huge network 

across the country of collegiate pool players 
through her masterminding of the UMTPC.

“I have so many memories of the bil-

liards room. It has played such a big role in 
the person that I am. I got a job there as an 
18-year-old kid and now I’m well into my 
forties,” she said nostalgically. “I met my 
partner of 27 years there ... he taught a pool 
class and I was working behind the desk. He 
was one of the best players in town and I had 
a crush on him.”

Sundholm struggled to recall other 

schools with comparable billiards halls, 
adding that some schools without any tables 
on campus have a flourishing billiards com-
munity, though they face massive hurdles.

“(Students from other schools) come 

here and this is like Disney World to them,” 
she added.

One of Sundholm’s favorite memories of 

the pool hall is when one of the most recog-
nizable faces of professional pool, Jeanette 
Lee or the “Black Widow,” came to play a few 
racks in 1998. The billiards room partnered 
with the Korean Student Association to bring 
Lee, a Korean-American, to campus.

When it comes to the pool hall closing, 

Sundholm has to separate her professional 
duty from personal feelings. Pile, her boss, 
sat in on our interview, perhaps to make 
sure she did so.

“Square footage in Ann Arbor is a pre-

mium,” she said. “On a personal level, it 
makes me sad, but professionally, I com-
pletely understand ... There will always be a 
demand to some extent for people who want 
to play pool, but I don’t think it’s going to be 
what the billiards room is right now. Stu-
dent needs evolve, spaces evolve…”

But the evolution of the Union will not 

just impact students. Whereas the billiards 
hall is open to the entire Ann Arbor com-
munity, the IdeaHub will be exclusive to 
students. Originally from Ypsilanti, Greg 
Jackson has lived in Ann Arbor for about 23 
years, but he’s been a regular at the pool hall 
for even longer.

“I started playing when I was 15 years 

old. All I wanted to do was play pool ... I was 
here almost every day for about 20 years. 
Almost every day,” he said. “It’s just the love 
of the game.”

Jackson says he endured a rollover car 

accident in 1995, which put him in a coma 
and permanently damaged his brain, but 
pool has helped him recover.

“I’ve learned to be patient. I’ve learned to 

accept things ... Pool has trained me to think 
about things in the long run. It’s trained me 
to take my time to concentrate and not just 
do the first thing that I see automatically.”

The billiards hall is not only Jackson’s 

home-away-from-home, but he says pool 
has taught him how to cope with a chaotic 
neighborhood at times.

“It’s been a great run for me here. I’ve 

loved every day that I’ve played here. I never 
got into a fight here. I never got into so much 
as an argument here. It’s just a peaceful 
place. It’s a peaceful place,” he said.

Since it was constructed and opened up to 

the public, the pool hall has been a corner-
stone of Ann Arbor, Jackson emphasized. 

He, like others, understands the financial 
turmoil of the room, but hopes the Univer-
sity can find another public space for pool.

“(The University) is focusing on educa-

tion and there’s nothing I can do about it, so 
I have to accept it. I have to accept things I 
can’t change and I can only change things in 
certain circumstances,” he dejectedly said, 
perhaps relaying a lesson he learned from 
the game of pool.

*****

But it isn’t just players mourning the bil-

liards hall’s death. LSA senior Alexandra 
Ngo has worked at the pool hall since her 
freshman year as a work-study employee, 
rising up the ranks to now serve as the facil-
ities and equipment manager.

“I’ve gotten to know everyone who comes 

in this room. I know everybody’s first name. 
I know what table they go to. I know what 
class they’re coming from and what they’re 
studying,” she said. “There’s a bunch of peo-
ple who have been here longer than some 
students have been alive.”

Alex works about 30 hours a week along-

side the 10 to 12 other work-study students 
who earn an income at the pool hall any 
given year. Over her four years at the pool 
hall, she has overseen weddings, bat-mitz-
vahs, bar-mitzvahs, “Sweet 16s” and many 
more events.

“It breaks my heart because I didn’t even 

know that the billiards room was included 
in the renovations until I got back to campus 
(this fall). And it breaks my heart every time 
alumni come in and say ‘Wow, this room has 
so much history,’” she said. “Coming in here 
and just talking to the regulars or people I 
recognize is one of my favorite things.”

Nguyen pointed out three distinctly mod-

ern tables in the far corner of the pool hall 
and explained they are Diamond Tables — 
the kind used in professional pool’s most 
competitive tournaments.

“We just bought these tables. We need 

a purpose for them ... This isn’t something 
you’re going to see drunk as hell sitting at 
Circus with people eating popcorn on them,” 

she said, referencing Circus Bar & Billiards 
on South 1st Street. “This is something that 
people literally drive to Ann Arbor to use. We 
are fighting to keep these in the building!”

Michigan Union employees declined to 

give the exact amount the University spent 
on the Diamond tables, but Sundholm says 
the total amount was less than $20,000. The 
fate of the tables are also uncertain as the 
University seeks a new home. 

Almost everyone I spoke to empathizes 

with the University’s rationale for closing 
the financially defunct pool hall, but Nguy-
en is unapologetically opposed.

“The University takes so much pride in its 

history and we talk about tradition and cul-
ture on campus, but if we get rid of the bil-
liards room I call bullshit … (The pool hall) 
is not only integral to U-M’s history, but also 
the history of Ann Arbor, so fuck U-M if we 
get rid of this.”

*****

This past summer I found myself in rural 

Buriram, Thailand for a weekend. No one 
spoke English, but everyone played pool. 
When I got on the table, I shed the role of 
strange foreigner and became just another 
player, shooting alongside everyone else. 
That bar, filled with smoke and tattered pool 
tables scarred by usage and lack of mainte-
nance, was a far cry from the Union’s bil-
liards hall.

In a few short months, the billiards hall 

will fall to the shadow of the Union, joining 
ghosts like the bowling alley and swimming 
pool. Pool will always be a part of my life, 
though that may mean playing more often on 
the unkempt tables down at Eightball Saloon 
on South 1st Street. But I will never forget 
the long days and late nights spent shooting 
on table 8 overlooking State Street alongside 
other wannabe hustlers, bonded by a shared 
passion for pool.

This semester is likely your last chance to 

shoot some racks in the same room as Michi-
gan’s greatest once did. Use the pool hall 
late in the semester, and you may be the 
room’s last.

My stream of conciousness saved me

I 

found 
myself 

completely 
alone, 

lacking a soul to call 
my friend.

It sounds melodramatic, but 

that was my reality. I didn’t 
choose it, nor—in my view at 
the time—was there much of an 
opportunity to escape it. 

Essentially, the group of 

guys I had become friends 
with through association in 
elementary school and the 
beginning of middle school 
started to see me as something 
different 
than 
a 
friend. 
I 

became a punching bag — the 
recipient of every joke. That’s 
how it started and it quickly 
spiraled into an incredible 
social exclusion that pushed 
me into near isolation.

I vividly remember wearing 

a brand new pair of loafers 
to school thinking I was the 
coolest kid in the halls that day. 
I strolled up to the group of guys 
I hung out with at school and 
before I could open my mouth, 
I was called a “faggot” for the 
shoes I had on. To my mom’s 
dismay, I never wore them again.

I can’t lie — even after the 

bullying started in seventh 
grade, I kept hanging out with 
these guys and didn’t stop 
associating with them until 
high school. Every person who 
has heard some rendition of 
my middle school days always 
asks why I didn’t just find a 
new group of people. Here’s 
the thing: No middle schooler 
really wants to admit they’re 
being bullied and have no 
friends. To me then, conceding 
that reality was worse than 
putting an end to the mental, 

physical and emotional abuses 
I was subject to.

I had my family, but how 

much does a seventh-grade 
boy want to hang out with just 
his family?

I started feeling depressed 

and anxious before I even 
knew what that meant. The 
summer after seventh grade, 
no one called asking to hang 
out with me. That memory is 
burnt into my mind and still 
stings as I think back on it.

But that’s the first time I 

put a pen to paper for the first 
time something other than an 
assignment. I can’t remember 
what exactly pushed me to do 
that — it seemed insignificant 
at the time — but what matters 
is that I did.

I poured myself into my 

writing because at that point, 
that was all I had. I couldn’t 
bring myself to talk about 
anything to anyone, but writing 
oddly seemed to be some sort 
of less than, but still sufficient, 
alternative to a friend I could 
ooze my reality into.

I 
wrote 
and 
wrote 
on 

Friday nights, Saturday nights 
and all the other nights my 
“friends” were together, all 
of 
which 
was 
extensively 

documented on Facebook. I 
had the pleasure of having all 
my anxieties confirmed when 
I went on social media, finding 
they were, in fact, hanging out 
without me.

To ease the pain of constant 

exclusion, I wrote about it.

I 
wrote 
anything 
that 

came to mind, whether it was 
fiction or poetry or just an 
account of my day. Writing 
not only gave me an outlet 
for what I was dealing with 
but also the opportunity to 
put my thoughts into a single 
stream, silencing the anxiety 
that sends my mind off in 
what seems to be hundreds of 
different directions.

My 
emotion-filled 
spiral 

notebooks 
are 
scattered 

throughout 
my 
room, 

purposely. I haven’t reopened 
most of them since I filled 
in the final lines. I already 
relive so many of those painful 
memories through flashbacks; 

the last thing I need is to 
remind myself about how I was 
exactly feeling between the 
lingering memories.

Writing has been the most 

constant thing in my life since I 
started over eight years ago and 
is now how I want to support 
myself once I’m on my own. 
It’s grown into somewhat of an 
obsession and the most sustained 
emotional outlet I have.

The bullying didn’t end 

until the end of my freshman 
year of high school, when I 
found actual friends. Instead 
of being in the midst of the 
trauma, I had to then deal 
with 
post-traumatic 
stress 

disorder. And even though 
I 
now 
had 
friends, 
the 

depression and PTSD were so 
isolating that I often didn’t 
feel like I had people around 
me that cared.

It 
wasn’t 
long 
after 
I 

first 
self-harmed 
that 
I 

found myself in the chair 
of a therapist and then a 
psychiatrist. 
From 
then 

to now, I made my rounds 
through the offices of about 
10 
therapists 
and 
three 

psychiatrists (I lost exact 
count over the years).

But the writing remained 

constant as I continued to fill 
journals with sometimes my 
lack of will to live and other 
times a brief recollection of a 
happy moment.

Writing, luck, friends and 

family kept me alive through 
most of high school. And I mean 
that in the most literal sense.

I give writing the most 

credit in helping me grow from 
a high school sophomore who 
tried to overdose to a college 
student three semesters away 
from 
graduating. 
Darkness 

was all I knew for an untold 
number of years, but through 
it, my passions and reality 
today have been shaped.

Sometimes, even now, it 

feels like my journal is the 
only given in my life that 
understands, especially as the 
PTSD has transformed itself 
into 
bipolar 
disorder. 
But 

even with the shift in how my 
trauma manifests itself, why I 
write hasn’t changed.

Empath in the Wild: Empathy is for everyone

BY REGAN DETWILER, COLUMNIST

O

ver 
the 
course 

of last semester, 
I 
wrote 
five 

columns 
about 

empathy — this one you’re 
reading now is my sixth and 
final one. I’ve written about 
empathy in the context of my 
Montessori elementary school; 
I’ve written about it in the 
context of Americanized yoga; 
I’ve gone into 
a 
somewhat 

philosophical 
debate 
about 

whether 
empathy 
and 

justice 
can 

coexist 
with 

one 
another; 

I’ve 
discussed 

empathy 
in 

the 
context 

of 
sexual 

and 
gender-

based violence 
and I’ve told 
a 
personal 

anecdote about 
how 
self-

absorption 
has 
prevented 

me 
from 

empathizing 
with others. 

Others 

have 
written 

about empathy 
from a variety 
of 
angles, 

approaching 
it 
with 

philosophical, 
psychological 
and 
creative 

nonfiction 
lenses. 
The 
writer 

Leslie 
Jamison 
approached 

empathy 
through 
writing 

autobiographical, 
creative-

nonfiction essays in her award-
winning 
collection, 
“The 

Empathy Exams,” which has 
been circulating throughout 
my fellow book-loving friend 
circles 
since 
it 
was 
first 

published in 2014.

These 
examples 
reveal 

some of the varied ways one 
can conceptualize empathy. 
While all of these disciplines 
— philosophy, psychology and 
creative writing — are in some 
ways very different from one 
another, they have at least one 
thing in common: They get 

into the nitty-gritty, gnarled 
intellectual 
and 
emotional 

roots of what empathy is. And 
sometimes, 
their 
findings 

ask the question of whether 
empathy, 
feeling 
what 

somebody else feels, is even 
possible.

While I think all of the 

examples 
I 
mentioned 
are 

honorable 
intellectual 

explorations, they can make 
the pursuit of empathy seem 
like a daunting endeavor, and 
therefore inaccessible. When 
I see a 240-page book with 
the title “Empathy: What It Is 
and Why It Matters,” it makes 
me think I need to know more 
in order to truly understand 
what empathy is. It leads me 
to believe I should be thinking 
about empathy in a more critical 
way, that maybe there’s more 
to it than just “stepping into 
someone else’s shoes,” and that 
I should be wary of my apparent 
ignorance on the topic.

Sometimes writing a lot of 

words about something can 

make it seem more accessible 
to people, and sometimes it 
can have the opposite effect. 
This is something I’ve spent a 
while thinking about since I’ve 
written a collective five columns 
on empathy this semester in 
efforts to spur self-reflection in 
those who read my writing.

I 
admit 
some 
of 
the 

arguments 
that 
empathy 

is 
actually 
impossible 
are 

compelling. I find the argument 
that it’s impossible to know 
anything at all compelling, too. 
Our perceptions of reality are 
entirely subjective, differing 
from person to person, so 
objective truth is a myth. But 
this doesn’t mean scientists 
should 
stop 
conducting 

experiments, or else we’d still 
be dealing with the bubonic 
plague.

I don’t think it matters 

if 
empathy 
is 
“ultimately” 

possible or not. Like striving 
to find out what’s scientifically 
“true,” I think striving to 
empathize is a worthwhile and 

necessary endeavor. Moving 
toward a more empathetic 
existence means people step 
outside themselves, and take 
on a more collective mentality, 
increasing the likelihood that 
individuals act selflessly rather 
than selfishly. While I admire 
the 
work 
of 
philosophers, 

psychologists, 
writers 
and 

other 
specialists 
who’ve 

studied empathy, I think it’s 
vital 
that 
intellectualized 

versions of empathy can coexist 
with a stripped-down version 
of empathy that’s accessible to 
everyone, not just the bookish.

Empathy, 
in 
the 
most 

basic sense, is feeling what 
someone 
else 
feels. 
It’s 

taking a walk in their shoes. 
It’s something that happens 
in the brain that can lead to 
empathetic actions. It takes 
the “golden rule,” “Treat 
others the way you want to 
be treated,” one step further. 
The empathetic “golden rule” 
is, “Treat others the way they 
want to be treated.”

Determining how someone 

else wants to be treated can 
be easy and it can sometimes 
be hard. Sometimes it’s as 
simple 
as 
saying 
“thank 

you” with a smile when a 
barista hands out my coffee. 
Empathetic action can be a 
little tougher when someone 
doesn’t want what I think 
they want.

I may think 

someone 
walking several 
yards 
behind 

me, exiting the 
Union, 
wants 

me to hold the 
door open for 
them to walk 
outside. 
But 

they’re kind of 
far away and 
they don’t want 
to “make” me 
hold the door 
for 
too 
long. 

They go from 
walking to a 
sort of trot, and 
the expression 
on their face 
is 
a 
mixture 

of 
guilt 
and 

embarrassment 
— for making 
me 
hold 
the 

door 
for 
too 

long, on the one 
hand, and for 
having to do 
this 
awkward 

jog thing, on 
the other. They 
might 
have 

preferred 
I 

never held the 
door open in 

the first place.

Practicing 
empathy 
can 

be complicated. But I think 
arbitrary 
debates 
on 
the 

definition of empathy and 
whether it’s actually possible 
can distract us from the 
points that actually matter. 
Empathy is something anyone 
and everyone can practice, 
and that it’s worth striving 
for, even if it’s not ultimately 
possible. At its best, empathy 
can be an incredibly powerful 
tool for justice, leading to 
a more democratic society 
where 
everyone 
tries, 
in 

earnest, to understand where 

each other is coming from.
