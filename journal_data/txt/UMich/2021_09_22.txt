Hundreds of local entheogenic 

and 
psychedelic 
plant 
activists 

gathered on the University of 
Michigan Diag on Sept. 19 for the 
first-ever Entheofest, a celebration 
and call for the decriminalization 
of plant medicines and fungi in Ann 
Arbor and beyond. The event began 
exactly at 11:11 a.m. and ended at 2:22 
p.m.

The celebration came a year after 

the Ann Arbor City Council voted to 
decriminalize the use and possession 
of entheogenic plants in September 
2020. The resolution the council 
voted to approve stated that arresting 
individuals for use of entheogenic 
plants such as mushrooms would 
be the city’s “lowest priority.” At 
the meeting, many community 
members voiced their support for 
the 
decriminalization 
of 
these 

psychedelic substances.

With 
the 
passage 
of 
the 

resolution, Ann Arbor became one 
of a handful of cities in the country to 
decriminalize psychedelics. Denver 
legalized entheogenic plants in May 
2019, becoming the first city to do so. 

In January 2021, Washtenaw 

County 
Prosecutor 
Eli 
Savit 

announced that his office will no 
longer prosecute individuals for use 
of marijuana or entheogenic plants. 
A few months later, in August, 
City Council declared September 
the Entheogenic Plant and Fungi 
Awareness month.

Ellie 
Ribitwer 
and 
Marina 

Chupac, criminal defense attorneys 
in Wayne County, decided to attend 
Entheofest 
together 
in 
support 

of 
the 
decriminalization 
and 

destigmatization of entheogens. 

“This is the beginning of getting 

everybody together, passing out 
information, setting up booths and 
having the prosecutors speak on it,” 
Ribitwer said. “There’s been a lot of 
prosecutions for this when really 
it doesn’t need to be categorized as 
a drug. I think it has crazy healing 
properties, the clinical tests on 
PTSD and depression and all of that 
is profound. And I think the War on 
Drugs is ending, and if Michigan can 
get ahead of it the way that California 
and Oregon have, let’s do it.” 

Chupac told The Michigan Daily 

she has “no shame” in admitting that 
she uses entheogens because she 
finds them helpful for improving her 
mental health.

“I’ve used these psychedelic plants 

in the past to open my mind and my 
heart,” Chupac said. “It’s changed 
the way I live, the way I look at 
everything I see and my connection 
to other people and that’s important. 
I think that psychedelics, in general, 
help open up that gateway, and the 
more connected we are, the better off 
we are as a unit.”

School of Social Work student 

Christian Smith attended the event 
and said Entheofest was planned 
in celebration of the anniversary of 
the council’s vote to decriminalize 
entheogenic plants.

“Psychedelics … have been used 

by humans for thousands of years 
for healing, both (for) interpersonal 
and intercultural healing,” Smith 
said. “And this is a celebration of the 
year anniversary of decriminalizing 
sacred plant medicines in Ann 
Arbor.”

State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 

Arbor, spoke to the crowd about his 
efforts to pass Senate Bill 631, which 
would legalize entheogenic plants 
and fungi for non-commercial use in 
Michigan. 

Students have expressed concern 

that a lack of knowledge about 
potential exposures could lead to 
increased spread of the virus since 
the University of Michigan stopped 
sending classroom and building 
COVID-19 notifications on Sept. 14. 

Previously, after a student tested 

positive for COVID-19, the University 
sent out a notification to the class 
rosters for all in-person and hybrid 
classes that the student was taking. 
However, the notification did not 
specify which class the student was 
in, the date that students could have 
been exposed or if the student who 
tested positive had even attended 
class in-person recently.

The University announced this 

policy change in an article published 
in the University Record. The 
announcement said that classrooms 
have not been associated with the 
spread of COVID-19, simply being 
in a class with somebody who tests 
positive for COVID-19 does not 
qualify as a “close contact” exposure 
and the notifications were confusing 
and of limited benefit.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel and Provost Susan Collins 
previously said classrooms are “the 
safest place to be on campus” due 
to mask and vaccine requirements. 
According to the Campus Blueprint, 
95% of students, 83% of staff and 94% 
of faculty are fully vaccinated.

Rackham student Ryan Glauser, 

COVID-19 caucus co-chair of the 
Graduate Employees’ Union, said the 
University did not inform GEO or 
Graduate Student Instructors prior 
to announcing the decision to end 
COVID-19 classroom notifications. 
Glauser said he would have preferred 

to learn about this information from a 
supervisor rather than via a Michigan 
Daily story.

“There is no reason that the union, 

or me, should find out that I’m no 
longer being told I’m getting exposed 
to COVID from a newspaper article,” 
Glauser said. “My supervisor should 
be the one telling me we’re making a 
substantial policy change here.” 

Though 
the 
University 

discontinued the notifications, they 
will continue to trace close contacts 
of people who tested positive for 
COVID-19, the Record article states. 
Robert Ernst, executive director of 
University Health Service, told the 
University 
Record 
close-contact 

tracing is a more effective mitigation 
strategy than the emails.

“Targeted 
individual 
case 

investigation and associated contact 
tracing are more effective parts of the 
mitigation strategy designed to limit 
spread,” Ernst said.

Glauser said he never received any 

COVID-19 classroom notifications, 
though several of his students 
personally told him they were 
diagnosed with COVID-19 or were 
quarantined due to close classroom 
contacts.

“I’ve only found out because my 

students have told me, and in the first 
few weeks I’ve had about a quarter 
of my class miss a week because of 
COVID issues,” Glauser said.

Music, Theatre & Dance junior 

Sam Todd said he believes the 
University should have improved the 
COVID-19 classroom notifications 
instead of ending them altogether.

“(The University) would tell you 

that there was a COVID case … but 
(they’re) not going to tell you where it 
is,” Todd said. “It was confusing, but 
don’t throw the baby out the window.”

From local coffee shops to Cuban 

restaurants to University of Michigan 
residence halls, Ann Arbor businesses 
say 
they 
are 
facing 
employee 

shortages, when the number of 
customers are increasing as COVID-
19 restrictions ease up and vaccination 
rates increase. 

This trend also exists nationwide, 

as labor shortages continue to 
challenge 
business 
owners 
and 

strain the productivity of their 
establishments. On campus, residence 
and dining halls are also facing similar 

difficulties in searching for student 
employees.

Economics 
professor 
Linda 

Tesar 
said 
that 
some 
people 

are still concerned about being 
exposed to COVID-19, especially 
in establishments where possibly 
unvaccinated 
customers 
are 

constantly coming in and out. 

Some people may have also begun 

to aim for higher pay and are willing 
to wait for a more ideal job to come 
along, Tesar said.

“Some workers could be covering 

their expenses with the COVID 
stimulus support and therefore have 
time to look for the job they really 
want, rather than take the next job 

that is available,” Tesar said. “And it 
could be that people’s views about 
how much they need to be paid to do 
certain kinds of work have shifted 
with the pandemic.” 

LSA junior Anthony Marx, a 

residential advisor in North Quad 
Residence Hall, said dining hall 
hours and residence hall activities 
have been limited due to the small 
number of available staff members. 
Some floors that are supposed to have 
two residential advisors are left with 
one, and dining halls are only open 
for a few blocks of time during the 
weekend, Marx said. 

Marx added that he hopes more 

people will apply to become staff 

members and allow dining and 
residency to return to a more normal 
schedule. 

“I would say apply for those jobs 

at MDining or Housing,” Marx said. 
“They are really a great opportunity 
to get some work experience under 
your belt but also support the 
University and (help us) get back 
to those hours that (students) were 
used to.”

During the first week of classes, 

as students faced long lines for 
busses, University spokesperson Kim 
Broekhuizen told the Daily it was due 
to a University labor shortage.

Leasing companies sue city over requirement that they wait 150 days to show property

ANN ARBOR

Local businesses, residence halls struggle to meet heightened demand for service

JUSTIN O’BEIRNE

Daily Staff Reporter

Multiple landlords and leasing 

companies in Ann Arbor are suing 
the city of Ann Arbor for a City 
Council ordinance passed Aug. 2 that 
gives tenants more time before they 
can be asked to renew their contracts.

The new Early Leasing Ordinance 

requires that landlords wait until 150 
days prior to the end of a lease before 
showing a property to prospective 
tenants. Before this ordinance was 
passed, landlords only had to wait 
70 days after a lease started before 
showing leasing units, though leasing 

companies have historically found 
ways to avoid the regulations.

Students and tenants have said 

the previous leasing timeline puts 
pressure on them to renew their 
leases or sign a new lease very early 
in the academic year. The ordinance 
aims to limit this pressure on tenants 
by giving them more time to decide 
if they want to renew as well as by 
giving them more time to search 
for the next year’s housing and 
roommates. 

Landlords 
shared 
their 

opposition to the restrictions during 
previous City Council hearings and 
are now considering ways to get 
around the regulations, which went 

into effect Aug. 15.

The Washtenaw Area Apartment 

Association, a non-profit organization 
that advocates on behalf of rental 
property owners, filed a lawsuit on 
Sep. 10 against the city of Ann Arbor in 
the U.S. District Court Eastern District 
of Michigan seeking to overturn the 
city’s early leasing restrictions. 

The plaintiffs, which include 

several companies that lease to 
students in Ann Arbor, argue 
the ordinance violates the First 
Amendment’s 
protection 
of 

“restrictions on commercial speech” 
that apply to landlords.

The landlord plaintiffs claim the 

ordinance did not have a specific 

governmental purpose and was 
solely created with the “private 
purpose” of catering to University of 
Michigan students. They also argued 
the regulations would expand the 
presence of unregulated renting.

“By enacting the (ordinance 

provisions) at the behest of certain 
University of Michigan students, the 
City has exercised its police power 
in the service of special, private 
interests at the sole expense of Ann 
Arbor landlords,” the complaint 
reads. “The (provisions) simply serve 
(to) encourage off-books or black-
market leasing activity.”

The University of Michigan is 

home to more than 1,700 student-
run organizations for students to 
join. Following a completely virtual 
year, many of these student organiza-
tions are now returning to in-person 
events, similar to pre-pandemic life. 
Others, however, are reaping the ben-
efits of continuing with a flexible vir-
tual or hybrid format. 

The Michigan Daily spoke to 

five leaders and members of student 
organizations to learn how they are 
adjusting to being in-person or choos-
ing to stay virtual as the new semester 
begins. 

Pre-pandemic life and the shift 

to a virtual format

Caiden Baxter, LSA Junior and 

member of the Adaptive Sports 
Student Interest Group, an organiza-
tion assisting those with and without 
disabilities in physical fitness oppor-
tunities and increasing awareness 
of adaptive sports, explained that 
the group heavily relies on in-person 
interaction. 

“Being so closely tied to physical 

activity and sports, pre-COVID our 
events were almost entirely held in 
person,” Baxter wrote. “During the 
shift to a remote format, our organiza-
tion had time to reassess our plans for 
when the campus reopened. We also 
worked with the (Adaptive Sports 
and Fitness) program to develop an 
accessible online physical fitness pro-
gram for at-home use.”

LSA senior Lydia Goff, co-presi-

dent of Best Buddies, shared that both 
their weekly meetings and monthly 
in-person community events were 
impacted by the pandemic. Best Bud-
dies is an organization that matches 
University students to an adult with 

intellectual or developmental disabili-
ties and hosts monthly events to build 
friendships and relationships.

In an email to The Daily, Goff 

wrote holding events for Best Buddies 
is significantly more difficult when 
done online, but the rewards can also 
be greater. Depending on the comfort 
level of members with getting togeth-
er with their buddies, Goff wrote that 
contact in friendships was mostly vir-
tual or socially distanced.

“COVID helped reinforce the 

importance of friendship and inclu-
sion in our members, as social isola-
tion touched all of our lives,” Goff 
wrote. “I think college buddies espe-
cially got a better understanding of 
how significant a simple phone call 
or texting conversation can be to both 
them and their buddies.”

Doctors of Tomorrow is a part-

nership between the Medical School 
and two Detroit high schools — 
Class Technical High School and 
Marygrove High School — serving 
as a channel for medical students to 
assist high schoolers and increase 
their involvement in the medical 
community. The organization previ-
ously met completely in person, with 
high school students visiting the 
Medical School at least once a month.

Medical School student Natalie 

Guzman, director of programming 
for Doctors of Tomorrow, explained 
that her role in the organization was 
significantly affected by the pan-
demic.

“A big reason that I got involved 

with Doctors of Tomorrow was 
because I wanted to actually interact 
with students and serve as a mentor,” 
Guzman said. “But because of the vir-
tual nature of everything, my role was 
slightly more administrative in terms 
of finding speakers, organizing small 
groups, things like that. I think if we 
were in-person I’d be able to interact 
with the students more.”

Deciding whether to return 

to in-person events and looking 
toward the future

With some classes still in a virtual 

or hybrid format, many clubs and 
organizations are seeing benefits 
from continuing to meet virtually. 

Public Health and Social Work 

student Brandon Bond, president of 
the Public Health Student Assem-
bly, explained the organization has 
advanced in a virtual format, despite 
the pandemic.

“I believe many of us are fully 

vaccinated and COVID-19 cautious, 
however with a board of our size it 
is easier and more convenient to 
hold our meetings virtually,” Bond 
wrote. “With the protocols of the 
university and potential change of 
guidelines, meeting virtually helps 
avoid all of that (confusion).” 

Guzman said Doctors of Tomor-

row was able to work with more 
students during the pandemic, a 
benefit of the virtual format. 

“Hopefully going forward we 

can do a hybrid type situation, in 
terms of getting to interact with 
students in person but also (main-
taining) the pros of the virtual 
world,” Guzman said. 

Though Baxter wrote the Adap-

tive Sports Student Interest Group 
was able to reach a wider audience 
of participants with a virtual for-
mat, he wrote they were eager to 
return to meeting and collaborat-
ing in person as soon as possible. 

“We hope to continue to spread 

awareness of … adaptive sports, as 
well as increase the variety of the 
programming we offer,” Baxter 
wrote.

Goff said that Best Buddies 

is looking forward to their first 
in-person event at the end of the 
month and they hope to expand 
their organization to include more 
buddies. 

“Once my buddy and I were vac-

cinated, we took advantage right 
away of the opportunity to get 
lunch together indoors without 
masks — something we had not 
been able to do for over a year,” Goff 
said. “This year, I’m hoping our 
organization can continue to grow 
its impact. … I’m hoping that we 
can expand our overall outreach 
and become a more familiar name 
in the Ann Arbor community.”

Recruitment during a virtual 

year

Because Festifall, a student 

organization recruiting fair, was 
held in person this semester, many 
organizations found recruiting to 
be easier than when it was done 
virtually. 

Goff wrote the event was an 

immense help for recruiting many 
new students. 

“We’ve had a huge surge in 

prospective college buddies and 
have been overwhelmed by their 
excitement,” Goff wrote. “I think 
Festifall 
definitely 
helped 
us 

attract more members, as well as 
our social media platforms. Many 
college buddies choose to join 
Best Buddies after doing it in high 
school so that always gives us a 
solid membership base.”

Baxter echoed this statement, 

saying the Adaptive Sports Student 
Interest Group is eager to return 
to in-person programming with 
many new members. 

“Recruiting members this year 

has been significantly easier than 
the virtual school year because 
so much of our programming has 
returned,” Baxter wrote. “We are 
excited to get people out and play-
ing sports again.”

 State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 

Arbor, spoke to the crowd about his 
efforts to pass Senate Bill 631, which 
would legalize entheogenic plants 
and fungi for non-commercial use in 
Michigan. 

“We know these substances have 

tremendous 
medicinal 
benefits,” 

Irwin said to the crowd. “We know 
they have religious and cultural 
significance. And we know that 
they’re not particularly harmful to 
people and these substances aren’t 
likely to lead to addiction.”

The bill, introduced by Irwin on 

Sept. 2, seeks to amend numerous 
sections of the public health code to 
include provisions related to the use 
and possession of entheogenic plants.

“An individual is not in violation 

of this section if the individual 
manufactures, creates, delivers, or 
possesses with intent to manufacture, 
create, or deliver an entheogenic plant 
or fungus without receiving money or 
other valuable consideration for the 
entheogenic plant or fungus,” the bill 
reads.

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 

Arbor, chose to speak at Entheofest 
to 
stress 
how 
pharmaceutical 

companies 
are 
“greedy” 
by 

advocating for the criminalization of 
entheogens.

“When 
you 
look 
at 
the 

pharmaceutical companies and the 
drugs that they’ve manufactured, 
look at the opioid epidemic — they 
have killed more people with the 
opioid epidemic than mushrooms 
have ever killed in their entire 
history,” Rabhi said to the audience. 
“There is no comparison. So, why are 
we allowing these pharmaceutical 
companies to continue to do their 
thing, and allowing these things to 
continue to be criminalized, when 
the real medicine is growing in the 
ground?”

Social 
Work 
student 
Moss 

Herberholz, 
president 
of 
the 

Student Association for Psychedelic 
Studies, said research has shown 
plant medicines have significant 
therapeutic 
potential 
and 
that 

efforts to decriminalize entheogenic 
substances is a step forward in ending 
the War on Drugs.

“Decriminalizing these substances 

reduces the number of people who 

are incarcerated through the racist 
War on Drugs,” Herberholz said.

The War on Drugs began during 

the 
Nixon 
administration 
and 

increased penalties for possession 
and use of marijuana, psychedelics, 
opioids and other substances. The 
heightened criminalization of drug 
use during this period coincided with 
a rise in law enforcement presence 
in predominantly Black and Latinx 
urban neighborhoods. As a result, 
Black and Latinx people make up 
about 80% of the total federal prison 
population.

Michael Williams, co-director 

of Decriminalize Nature Michigan, 
secretary for Michigan Psychedelic 
Society and member of the Board of 
Directors for Students for Sensible 
Drug 
Policy, 
helped 
organize 

Entheofest and delivered a speech 
at the event. Williams has been in 
recovery from opioid addiction for 15 
years and credits entheogens to the 
start of his recovery.

“It was a single psychedelic 

mushroom experience trying to just 
chase another high, where I took a 
look in the cosmic mirror and saw 
myself and the things I was doing to 
my body, and realized that I needed 

to make some life changes,” Williams 
told The Daily. “I then was able to give 
up opioids, able to distance myself 
from 
methamphetamines, 
and 

started looking at psychedelics as a 
way to connect with spirituality and 
find myself.”

Though he ran into legal trouble 

for using entheogens, Williams said as 
a white person he saw people of color 
receive harsher legal consequences 
than he did, which inspired his start 
in drug decriminalization activism. 

“Having been in the opioid war 

and having been on the receiving end 
of criminal justice issues regarding 
drug law, I found myself recognizing 
that I may be a white guy getting in 
trouble,” Williams told The Daily. 
“But, quite frankly, for every one of 
me, there’s nine people of color in 
this situation. And I started to see the 
racial disparity (in) all this. So that’s 
when I became a drug policy activist.”

ENTHEOFEST 
FROM PAGE 1 


Gov. Gretchen Whitmer pro-

posed allocating $75 million of fed-
eral COVID-19 funds to provide 
Michigan law enforcement with bet-
ter training, find and remove illegal 
guns from Michigan communities 
and fund community programs that 
provide more opportunities in educa-
tion, jobs and the justice system.

This 
proposal, 
which 
was 

announced in Detroit last month, 
comes in the wake of an increase 
in violent crime in Michigan over 
the past year, with the crime rate in 
Detroit increasing by 9.41% and the 
homicide rate in Detroit increasing 
by 19%.

In her announcement of the pro-

posal, Whitmer cited the impor-
tance of ensuring safety for citizens 
of Michigan as her motivation for 
the funding decision.

“People are scared,” Whitmer 

said. “They’re afraid to pump their 
gas or merge onto the highway, 
pull up to a red light, drive to work, 
drop their kids off at school. That’s 
not right, and we cannot and will 
not accept this. No one should feel 
unsafe as they go about their lives.” 

Whitmer’s proposal for increased 

funding comes after protests erupt-
ed across the country last summer 
following ongoing police violence, 
as calls to defund law enforcement 
gained support.

LSA senior Noah Streng, presi-

dent of Young Democratic Social-
ists of America at the University of 

Michigan, is discontent with Whit-
mer’s announcement. Streng said he 
believes that increasing funding of 
law enforcement will not decrease 
violence or crime and that this fund-
ing expansion does not address 
socioeconomic disparities facing 
Michigan communities as a result of 
the pandemic.

“I think that Governor Whitmer 

is wrong when she says that police 
keep us safe,” Streng said. “It’s true 
that we have seen an uptick in vio-
lent crime over the past year, but 
crime doesn’t just happen for no rea-
son. There are real material reasons 
why people are turning to crime.” 

David Helps, co-chair of the 

Graduate Employees Organization’s 
Abolition caucus, said he thinks 
lawmakers must look at more than 
crime rates when making policy pro-
posals and decisions. He highlighted 
Detroit’s 45% unemployment rate 
during the pandemic and the impact 
that has had on communities and 
crime rates across the city.

“People have been traumatized, 

people have been sick, have lost 
work, have known people that have 
died, and all of those forms of suf-
fering have been concentrated in 
certain cities and in certain commu-
nities,” Helps said. “Those are some 
of the same places in which we’re 
seeing an increase in certain forms 
of violence.”

Proponents of this proposal have 

argued that sufficient police training 
is key to decreasing violence among 
communities because it will help 
law enforcement better equipped to 
handle high-stress situations.

LSA sophomore Alex Manthous 

supports Whitmer’s proposal and said 
he thinks this increase in funding will 
help promote safety across the state.

“I stand with her decision not to 

defund the police,” Manthous said. 
“I am a proponent of getting illegal 
weapons off the street, especially 
since crime is closely associated with 
guns and illegal weapons.”

Streng said he believes the police 

should be defunded with a focus 
on allocating more money to com-
munity programs in communities 
that have been divested from. This 
money would be used to bolster 
education, housing and mental and 
physical health, Streng said, which 
may subsequently decrease violence.

“We cannot arrest our way out 

of this problem,” Streng said. “If we 
took federal funding and coupled it 
with shifting resources away from 
police departments and towards 
robust social services, jobs, educa-
tion and health care, we would see 
a much different outcome, where 
people would have the opportuni-
ties and abilities to get themselves 
out of poverty and not have to turn 
to crime.”

The governor’s proposal is await-

ing support from the Republican-
held legislature, which has touted 
bipartisan support for increased 
law enforcement and funding of the 
police.

Helps expressed his frustration at 

the lack of action to address the root 
causes of violence from both sides of 
the aisle.

Latinx Heritage Month 2021 

celebrations at the University of 
Michigan commenced Wednesday 
evening with the opening ceremony 
in the Rogel Ballroom at the Michigan 
Union. With Latin pop music blasting 
from speakers, the smell of Latinx 
food lingering in the air and students 
pairing up to learn salsa dancing, the 
ceremony marked the first event in a 
month of cultural gatherings.

Across the nation, LHM is 

celebrated annually between Sep. 15 
and Oct. 15, a period during which five 
Latin American countries as well as 
Mexico and Chile commemorate the 
anniversary of their independence. 
The holiday originated in 1968 
as a week-long celebration called 
Hispanic Heritage Week, but was 
later renamed and expanded to a full 
month in 1988.

Every year LHM has been 

celebrated at the University, the 
program has been given a different 
theme, 
with 
this 
year’s 
being 

“florecemos de nuestras raíces,” 
or “we bloom from our roots.” The 
hybrid ceremony was attended by 
students in-person, with several 
viewing the festivities from the 
virtual livestream.

Anamaria 
Lopez, 
Education 

graduate student and the LHM 
student 
coordinator, 
opened 

the ceremony by explaining the 
significance of the 2021 theme. Lopez 
said the theme acknowledges how the 
historical experiences — the “roots” 
— of Latinx communities shape their 
tenacity and resilience in the present 
day and allow them to “bloom.”

“The (LHM) planning committee 

decided that we wanted to celebrate 
Latinx heritage by honoring the 
beautiful culture, vivid life and all 
the hard work that our ancestors and 
those who have come before us have 
put in,” Lopez said. 

The ceremony officially opened 

with a land acknowledgment and 
a welcome address from Martino 
Harmon, vice provost for student 
life. 
In 
his 
address, 
Harmon 

called upon attendees to reflect 
on the contributions of the Latinx 
community with those around them 

during the rest of the night as well as 
every day throughout LHM.

“I encourage you to practice 

inclusive leadership and celebrate 
your community wherever you go, 
whatever you do,” Harmon said. “The 
roots of this history, this community, 
reach deep.” 

In 
2020, 
8% 
of 
University 

undergraduate students identified 
as Hispanic, with Hispanic faculty 
members constituting just 4% of total 
faculty at the Ann Arbor campus. 

Lopez told The Michigan Daily 

the University has been expanding 
campus LHM celebrations over the 
past several years, though last year’s 
activities were completely virtual. 
Lopez said it is important to highlight 
the contributions Latinx culture has 
made within the U.S. to empower 
what is often an underrepresented 
and marginalized community at the 
University and nationwide.

“(LHM) acknowledges all of the 

movements and the history and the 
people who are of Latinx descent who 
have (also) made an impact within the 
United States,” Lopez said. “In reality, 
this should always be happening, but 
the truth is that it’s not.”

Michelle 
Ferrez, 
director 
of 

the 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity Program, gave the 
keynote address. In her speech, Ferrez 
spoke on her personal experience 
with encountering and fighting racial 
injustice during her time in college. 

She also described the “cultural 

capital” model, referring to the 
inherent value of non-quantifiable 
assets associated with a particular 
culture — including social justice, 
storytelling and aspirations — that 
promote social mobility. 

Ferrez gave examples of ways 

the cultural capital model could 
positively transform and equalize 
higher education, and challenged 
attendees to use their own cultural 
capital to improve their communities.

“We need leaders like all of you 

with your Latinx (perspectives) 
and that capital each and every one 
of you have, to (address) racism, 
environmental justice, climate issues, 
needs of communities with water 
systems, access to food … not just in 
our communities in the United States, 
but in our home countries throughout 
Latin America, throughout Central 
America, throughout the islands, 

the Caribbean throughout Mexico,” 
Ferrez said.

Jesús Galván, program manager 

of the University’s Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs, told The Daily 
Ferrez was selected by a committee 
of MESA members on account of the 
relevant research she has completed 
about educational equality for those 
identifying as a part of marginalized 
communities.

“For one, (Ferrez) is familiar 

with the experience we’re trying 
to represent and speak about, but 
also, they’re part of us here at U-M,” 
Galván said. “So we shine light on 
the folks that are doing the good 
work and are critical components to 
student success on this campus.”

Lopez said MESA began planning 

this year’s LHM over the summer, with 
an important part of the preparations 
involving MESA’s collaboration with 
Michigan Dining chefs who identify 
as Latinx. Throughout the opening 
ceremony, attendees were encouraged 
to try different food items from the 
buffet which included tostones, arepas, 
arroz con gandules and empanadas. 

The two main chefs — Luz Ruiz 

from Panama and Miriam Palacio 

from Colombia — were also given the 
opportunity to explain their personal 
backgrounds and identities to the 
crowd as well as why they chose to 
prepare each specific dish for the 
event.

Empanadas, Palacio told The Daily, 

are usually made using corn flour-
based dough. But she had experience 
in Colombia making the dough with 
flour derived from the yuca root, 
which makes the dish gluten-free so 
more students can try it.

“I used yuca to make the dough 

and it makes this food be gluten-free,” 
Palacio said. “I hope you guys enjoy … 
their Colombian flavor.” 

Autumn Battin-Flores, the senior 

associate director of retail and catering 
for the University, told The Daily 
MCatering has been collaborating 
with 
MDining 
and 
cultural 

organizations on campus for three 
years to serve authentic cuisine at 
various heritage month events. Flores 
said encouraging chefs to cook dishes 
from their individual cultures is a 
promising start to promoting culinary 
diversity within campus dining.

NEWS

Virus cases remain stable after sharp rise in late August

Since 
students 
returned 
to 

campus in late August, the number 
of 
positive 
COVID-19 
cases 

associated 
with 
University 
of 

Michigan students has increased 
then decreased.

The number of COVID-19 cases 

increased from 73 on the week of 
Aug. 22 to 195 the week of Aug. 29, 
the first day of classes.

Preliminary data from the two 

weeks since then shows numbers 
have remained high at 156 the week 
of Sep. 5, then dropping to 82 for the 
week of Sep. 12. 

Since class began, positivity rates 

have remained under 2%.

In an email to the University 

community on Friday, President 
Mark Schlissel wrote that per the 
dashboard, “case numbers and our 
quarantine housing usage have 
flattened.”

In an email to The Michigan Daily 

last Thursday, Dr. Robert Ernst, 
associate vice president of student 
life for health and wellness and 
the director of COVID-19 Campus 
Health Response, wrote he believes 
the University’s mitigation strategies 
such as masking and vaccination 
reduce the risk of transmission 
on campus, even with the more 
contagious delta variant. 

“Given 
the 
repopulation 
of 

campus and many associated large 
social gatherings where masking is 
not universal, the finding of covid 
transmission among students early 

in the fall semester is not surprising,” 
Ernst wrote. “Peer institutions 
like ours have seen similar early 
increases, and campuses like ours 
that started earlier have seen these 
early increases followed by a gradual 
decline.”

In the past few weeks, doctors 

across the state have reported seeing 
a gradual increase in the number 
of COVID-19 cases in hospitals. 
According to Jakob McSparron, 
associate director of the critical care 
medicine unit at Michigan Medicine, 
the number of cases per week in the 
past month has risen from 25, to 35, 
to 45 as the delta variant has spread. 

“The rise is a little bit slower 

compared to the previous surges we 
used to see,” McSparron said. “This 
time it’s more of a steady increase in 
our numbers.” 

Hallie Prescott, a pulmonary care 

physician at Michigan Medicine, 
said in an email she believes these 
rising trends should be of concern to 
students. 

“It is certainly worth noting 

that COVID is circulating in our 
community, and therefore (it is) 
important to take extra precautions 
such as wearing a mask while in 
public indoor spaces,” Prescott 
said. “Even if one’s personal risk of 
hospitalization/death from COVID 
is low, these extra measures are 
important to keep case counts low 
and protect our community as a 
whole.”

According to McSparron, the 

majority of patients in the intensive 
care unit at Michigan Medicine 
are unvaccinated. The few that 

are vaccinated have underlying 
conditions putting them at risk, he 
said. 

McSparron said he believes things 

could start to look more normal if 
vaccination rates increased. 

“Unfortunately, 
I 
think 
we 

are seeing more young patients 
this time around in terms of the 
unvaccinated,” McSparron said. “It’s 
very hard to see a 20-year-old on a 
breathing machine knowing that so 
much of this was preventable.” 

LSA sophomore Lana King 

said she first started to notice 
the uptick when she received 
multiple 
“COVID-classroom” 

notifications, which have since been 
discontinued.

“I personally don’t feel too scared 

because we’re all wearing masks and 
especially in class, you’re not getting 
that close to people,” King said.

When asked if the recent trends in 

COVID-19 cases on campus should 
be concerning to students, Ernst 
said it’s too soon to predict further 
developments this fall. 

“There has not been evidence of 

transmission within residence halls 
and fortunately, as we would expect 
in a highly vaccinated population, 
most affected individuals experience 
only mild symptoms,” Ernst said. 

Ernst 
said 
the 
University 

is in a very different position 
compared to the last academic 
year, when Washtenaw County 
had to use stay-in-place orders and 
recommendations to curb the spread 
of the virus.

Anna, an orphan in 15th-century 

Constantinople; 
Omeir, 
a 
poor 

woodcutter’s son, his cleft palate 
proof of a demon’s presence; Zeno, 
an old man in modern-day Lakeport, 
Idaho; 
Seymour, 
an 
autistic 

Generation-Z teenager raised in 
that same town; Konstance, a girl 
aboard a spaceship in some distant 
future with only a tangle of conscious 
wires to keep her company; Aethon, 
a fictional man whose story connects 
everyone else through time and 
space. These are the characters 
around which Anthony Doerr’s 
“Cloud Cuckoo Land” revolves.

“Cloud Cuckoo Land” is a deeply 

ambitious book. Six stories spread 
across four ages, three nations and 
two worlds. It is part contemporary, 
part historical, part science fiction, 
part myth. For most authors, 
attempting a feat like this would 
result in a jumbled mess of plot lines 
and a desperate need to simplify.

But Anthony Doerr is not most 

authors. The Pulitzer Prize winner 
for “All the Light We Cannot See” has 
a truly extraordinary ability to weave 
together different lives, deftly pulling 
the strings to cause them to crash 
into one another before spiraling 
away again. 

In chapters of only a few pages, full 

of prose that beautifully contrasts the 
stark humanness in each scene, Doerr 
manages to explore six multifaceted 
individuals — their ambitions, their 
families, their struggles and their 
fears — without losing sight of the 
common thread around which all 
of their lives pivot: a story from a 
different time, one that promises 
more than what their lives have given 
them. They each come to find solace 
in the fable of Aethon, the “dimwit” 
sheepherder who longed to become a 
bird so he could fly to Cloud Cuckoo 
Land, a magical city in the sky.

For a story so grand in scope, 

the book still feels intimate and 
personal. It takes a great gift to make 
an audience sympathize with every 
character — to worry for them, care 
for them and forgive them — and it’s 
a gift Doerr thankfully possesses. 
There is no character whose chapters 
I had to slog through (a common 
occurrence in multi-narrative books), 
none that I grew disinterested in or 
lost my patience with.

Each time the narrative shifted 

back to a character who hadn’t been 
heard from in a while, it felt like 
catching a new episode of a well-liked 
TV show: short, sweet, and then you 
change the channel and forget about 
it until next week. Though there 
were moments when it was difficult 
to switch focus from one character’s 
narrative to another, and I was 
tempted to skip ahead so I could 
continue one story, I’m glad I didn’t. 
Doerr knows what he’s doing. Trust 
the process.

In a characteristic fashion, Doerr 

centralizes the conflict between 
sets of characters. There’s Seymour, 
who attempts to bomb a library in 
which Zeno is directing a children’s 
play, and then there’s Omeir, who’s 
drafted to help bring down the city 
walls behind which Anna lives. 
Sworn enemies, who are bound to 
one another by pain instead of love, 
can nonetheless find the humanity in 
each other.

Despite the complexity — Greek 

mythology, wars fought half a 
millennia apart and some spaceships 
thrown in for good measure — this is 
fundamentally a story of seeing one 
another and acknowledging whatever 
it is that makes us so intrinsically 
similar across all barriers.

We meet Konstance as she’s 

bent over the scraps of paper she 
salvages from her food bags, stitching 
together the history of humanity in 
the limited hours of light she’s given 
each day; the makeshift pen and ink 
with which she writes is a lifeline to 
a world outside her sterile room. A 
millennium before, Anna learns in 
secret how to read, sneaking candles 
into the closet-sized room she shares 
with her sister so she can pore over 
the Odyssey every night, desperate 
for an escape from her miserably 
boring life. In another time, Zeno 
fights for democracy in Korea while 
Omeir fights for his family’s honor 
and his kingdom in Constantinople. 
Each is an entirely distinct path that 
somehow mirrors all the others. 
Each person is searching for Cloud 
Cuckoo Land.

Upon closing the book, it’s 

impossible not to wonder how those 
who come next will perceive us. 
Which of our stories will last, which 
will vanish and which will only ever 
be remembered by an unlikely few, 
our words still forming invisible 
bonds between strangers long after 
we’re gone?

This review is a companion piece to Katrina 

Stebbins’s “Stage meets screen in ‘Come From 
Away,’ a deeply empathetic retelling of lesser-
known stories of 9/11.”

There’s something special about the space 

that theaters inhabit, especially when they’re 
empty. The ghost light filters throughout 
the empty orchestra and mezzanine, the 
world-weary seats filled with the specters of 
past guests, people who once filled them in 
anticipation of being transported elsewhere 
for the next two hours. The stage stands bare, 
the curtains framing the proscenium like 
velvet bangs, the interior an empty picture 
full of potential: The potential for stage crews 
to push massive, scene-stealing set pieces out 
of the wings, the potential for the actors to 
egress from backstage into the world they 
exist in for a few hours a day, the potential to 
be someone else and the potential to entertain, 
inform and change the lives of those viewing 
the experience.

The air singes with electric possibilities, 

the entire theater impatient for actors to once 
again fill the stages and audiences to fill the 
seats. There is a magic in theater that has 
been desperately missing from our lives since 
Broadway and theaters nationwide closed 
down due to the pandemic; the show simply 
could not continue to go on when we most 
needed it. 

I spent all four years in high school inside the 

walls of our theater. I had class there daily with 
people who became family, and I probably spent 
more time with them than at my actual house 
with my actual family. Coming to the University 
of Michigan, I was quick to get familiar with 
the various student theater groups, because, 
although I am now a film major, I could never 
let go of the stage entirely.

Whenever I was home in New Jersey 

for the holidays, I tried to make at least one 
pilgrimage to Manhattan to see whatever 
show I could get tickets for. I was devastated 
when theaters closed for the pandemic, and I 
have been anxiously awaiting the day I will be 
able to sit down for a live show again. Whether 
it be straight plays, Shakespeare or musicals, 
theater has always been the constant in my life, 
the binding rock through fits of depression, 
anxiety, heartbreak and whatever other extra 
hardships life threw my way. I met some of my 

best friends through acting and cannot even 
begin to count the number of shows that have 
had a profound impact on my life.

Not having theater around in its traditional 

form for over a year hurt. So when I saw that 
“Come From Away” was finally available on 
Apple TV+, I clicked play immediately. 

“Come From Away” is the story of the 

townsfolk of Gander, Newfoundland, and 
how they came together in the aftermath of 
9/11 — when airspace was closed over America 
— to house up to 7,000 diverted travelers who 
could not get home. The show has long been a 
personal favorite of mine; the music is folksy 
and engaging, the lyrics are often profound 
and help a slim, well-paced book tell the story 
of the hundreds of real-life people portrayed 
by 12 actors.

The simple wooden set works in tandem 

beautifully with the light design, giving a 
seemingly empty space incredible depth 
and versatility. In person, everything comes 
together under the direction of Christopher 
Ashley (“The Rocky Horror Show”), in both 
the theatrical and filmed production, to 
form a riveting and emotionally charged 
one-act show. Thankfully, Ashley keeps 
his keen directorial eye and transfers the 
in-person experience seamlessly into the 
pro-shot.

Rather than being a film adaptation of 

a show, a pro-shot is quite literally a filmed 
version of a stage production. The camera 
movements and edits are there to help 

enhance the experience, often helping to 
focus the massive framing and blocking of live 
shows for smaller screens.

Pro-shots are far from a new concept — they 

have existed within the Broadway community 
for years — but it was only recently that people 
woke up to the larger general demand for them 
and began to view them as a possible solution 
to the class problems plaguing theater. When a 
ticket costs upwards of $300 dollars for a single 
seat, maybe less if you’d settle for one in the 
nosebleeds, it becomes hard for everyone who 
isn’t from an upper-middle-class family to see 
shows. Productions as powerful and essential 
as “Come From Away” have a greater impact 
when more people have access to them; thus, it 
is a great boon for everyone that the pro-shot is 
available for wider consumption. 

Part of the reason that “Come From Away” 

is vital viewing for everyone is because it is 
not your typical 9/11 fare. The show is never 
saturated with American exceptionalism, 
calls to arms for our troops or the war that 
ensued after the attack; rather, it focuses 
on how the death and destruction affected 
everyone around the world. A majority of the 
characters in the show are not even American 
citizens, and those who are usually don’t let 
that define them.

Married writing duo Irene Sankoff and 

David Hein focus the piece on empathy and 
compassion, on a community coming together 
to help complete strangers during a time of 
pure fear and tragedy. We follow all these 

Newfoundlanders, their kettles always on and 
their beds always set for visitors because they 
put helping others ahead of their own daily 
lives and routines.

***
Gander has an interesting history as 

a refugee-hub: As Newfoundland’s only 
international airport, and a place where flights 
from all over often stop to refuel, flights during 
the Cold War Era frequently emptied, only 
leaving the flight crew as everyone else asked 
for political asylum. Other events throughout 
history, such as Y2K, have unknowingly acted 
to prepare Gander’s citizens and its airport for 
the events that unfolded on Sept. 11.

Since then, Gander has not experienced a 

refugee event of similar scale, but I imagine 
that doesn’t change the fact that the townsfolk 
are always ready and waiting to welcome more 
“come from aways,” should the opportunity 
ever present itself. It makes one sit and think: 
“Would we do that?” While individual 
answers may vary, I believe that, after 
watching America over the past two years of 
the pandemic, the answer is no, we would not.

That’s the true power of “Come From 

Away” and why its release, not only in time for 
the 20th anniversary of 9/11 but also during 
a pandemic, is so powerful. The show lives 
and breathes friendliness and empathy, but 
is not afraid to delve into the darker parts of 
the rebuilding process, including the rampant 
Islamophobia and trauma that we as a nation 
still struggle with today.

And that’s the key word here: trauma.
We have all been subjected to a year and 

a half of unmitigated trauma at the hands of 
COVID-19. Our first responders have worked 
tirelessly since the beginning of 2020 and are 
far beyond running on fumes as emergency 
rooms continue to fill and overflow. It is so 
ridiculously easy to look at the news — to 
look at all the states banning mask mandates 
and all the people ignoring rules or falsifying 
vaccine cards — and be overwhelmed by the 
selfishness.

Just like in the aftermath of 9/11, many 

people quickly moved back from “us” to 
“me,” but that doesn’t minimize the good that 
people are still doing. Acts of pure compassion 
and goodness still resonate like beacons of 
radiant warmth and remind us that for all 
the bad, there will always be good to balance 
it out. “Come From Away” floats above it 
all as a lifeboat of affection and community, 
highlighting the stories of those who helped 

during the unimaginable. 

***
The best theater sits you down in that 

slightly uncomfortable velvet chair, whose 
armrests dig into your arms just a little, 
challenges 
everything 
you 
know 
and 

reaffirms your humanity. It may not have 
been live, but simply seeing people back on 
stage, performing in a room full of vaccinated 
and masked patrons, made me cry. Some 
deep unknown sadness voiced itself as the 
Newfoundlanders went through their own 
“Blankets and Bedding” for the sake of the 
plane people, and I cried. 

I cried for theater and how much I missed 

it. I cried for the majesty of seeing live 
performances again, of imagining myself one 
day soon in the audience supporting an art 
form I love and desperately miss. I cried for the 
beautiful story and the beautiful book and the 
beautiful songs and the beautiful actors finally 
getting to do what they love once again.

I cried for the terrors that I know everyone 

went through on and because of 9/11, when I 
was barely even two, and my family had just 
moved back to the United States. I cried for 
the terrors and atrocities and traumas that we 
are going through now, the seemingly never-
ending variants always looming overhead, 
blocking the exit. I cried because deep down, I 
know we will get through this. Someday.

But so many people have been and will 

be lost and the world will feel emptier and 
irrevocably different until it is all we know as 
normal.

I cried because this pandemic will always 

be a part of our lives, a foundational piece in 
the puzzle of who we are decades from now 
when it seems like a funny memory but hurts 
like an open wound.

I cried because it will be only then, years 

and years from now when hundreds of 
thousands more tragedies have occurred, that 
we will finally be able to sit down and fully 
accept everything that happened because it is 
too distant to change.

I cried because in the face of all this death, 

all this selfishness and tragedy, people find it 
within themselves to be vulnerable, to love 
and care and extend a helping hand even to 
those who would not do the same.

These are the people shows will be made 

about, not the ones who defined how we acted 
but how we want to believe we acted. Because 
if there is that much good in some of us, there 
has to be hope for the rest of us too.

‘Cloud Cuckoo Land’

‘Come From Away’ understands we cannot move on from tragedy

M. DEITZ

Digital Culture Beat Editor

In March of 2020, Canadian metal band 

Spiritbox was raring to record. They had just gotten 
back from their first tour and were sitting on a pile 
of material.

COVID-19 derailed that plan indefinitely. At one 

point, the band thought, “We might have to just do 
this record over Zoom.” Now, that material is an 
album titled Eternal Blue that will finally release 
Sept. 17. Completing the album took nearly a year 
and an excursion to the Californian desert. 

Spiritbox is made up of Mike Stringer, 

frontwoman (and Stringer’s wife) Courtney 
LaPlante, drummer Zev Rose and bassist Bill 
Crook. The band began in 2016 and has amassed a 
following that places them alongside metal acts like 
Underoath and Slipknot.

Here’s more from Stringer about the album’s 

creative process, Spiritbox’s upcoming tours and 
Stringer’s guitar style. The following conversation 
between the artist and The Daily has been edited 
for clarity. 

***
Anish Tamhaney: Mike, how are you doing?
Mike Stringer: Doing well, man. Gearing up to 

leave in a couple days and getting the new set ready. 
It’s just kind of funny, being home for a very brief 
period of time and then having to go right back out 
again. 

AT: So, Spiritbox’s debut album, Eternal Blue, 

is dropping in a few weeks, and I’m curious about 
your process for creating the album. Do you have a 
specific memory in the process of writing that album 
that really sticks out to you, or you cherish a lot?

MS: While everything else in the world was 

changing, we had to keep redesigning in our heads 
what the recording was going to look like. It even 
went to the point where we were like, well, ‘We 
might have to just do this record over Zoom.’ Just 
remotely. Now, the plus side of that is, it allowed us to 
write more, create a lot more music and have a big pot 
to pull from, so to speak. But the moments that I will 
cherish the most are actually just going out and doing 
it, back in this last February 2021. We went to Joshua 
Tree. And we got a random house on a 20-acre 
property in the middle of the desert. The average 
coffee run took about 45 minutes because that’s how 
far out we were. Just living that, day in, day out for 30 
days, coming out with the album, having a finished 
product at the end of it was definitely something I’ll 
never forget. But what a lead-up. Oh my god, that 
was a long time of just sitting around just waiting 
and hoping that we could get in to record it soon. So, 
frustration, but also very fulfilling at the end.

AT: Going back to what you said about thinking 

about doing the album on Zoom, one thing I’ve heard 
you guys talk about is that years ago, when you were 
a smaller band, you were used to recording things 
in different rooms, maybe even across the country 
and then mixing them together later. Do you think 
that those early days prepared you for writing and 
recording an album during the pandemic?

MS: Big time. Everything up until Eternal Blue 

and the two singles we’ve done previously, “Blessed 
Be” and “Rule of Nines,” the first two EPs were 
done in my parents’ basement. We would hire an 
engineer to record my guitar and I would record 
bass as well. Then I would record Courtney’s 
vocals. We would send all those files off to Dan 
(Braunstein), who actually mixed and produced 
Eternal Blue as well. We’ve been working with him 
since day one. That do-it-yourself mentality — if 
that’s all you know, then you just become used to 
it. Going into a studio and physically recording it is 
such a treat, and it’s such a step up. Once we started 
doing that, with the first two singles “Blessed Be” 
and “Rule of Nines,” I was like, ‘I could never go 
back. I don’t want to do this in my parents’ basement 

anymore.’ With Eternal Blue, we did a lot of writing 
sessions over Zoom, with some stuff that actually 
made the album. Dan took control of my computer, 
I tracked it on and we just saved it. When we were 
thinking about having to do it all over Zoom, it was a 
bummer just because of the sheer amount of songs. 
“Holy Roller” and “Constance” were actually done 
over Zoom. So it’s not, ‘Oh, I don’t know, if we could 
pull this off.’ It was just more so like, ‘I know we can 
pull this off. But, I really don’t want to have to do an 
entire album, sitting in my apartment and hoping 
that the internet connection holds up the entire 
time.’ I definitely think acting in that way for so long 
really prepared us.

AT: I’m actually a guitarist myself, and one of 

the things that I appreciate about your playing, in 
particular, is that you always save room for cleaner 
tones. There’s always a variety rather than just 
distortion all the time. I’m curious to know, how 
does that fit into your writing process? How did 
striking that balance play a role in Eternal Blue?

MS: The album is very different from a lot of 

our stuff that we’ve done. It has the widest variety 
of styles that we’ve done … Learning the balance … 
beforehand was a big back and forth because we 

actually weren’t including Courtney on the writing 
process. I would make an entire song and show it to 
her. And then I’d be like, ‘You have to figure this out 
because I’ve spent a couple weeks on this, so I’m not 
going back and changing stuff.’ Moving forward 
for every song on Eternal Blue, whenever I would 
write something, Courtney would immediately get 
on the mic, and she would start humming a melody 
or whatever. In that way, we could figure out 
immediately if this was the right key or comfortable 
in her range. She ultimately is the most important 
part of this band — she’s the voice of it. So, with the 
clean and ambient elements, I feel like there’s a lot 
more of a balance on Eternal Blue because I was 
able to hear and see what Courtney was going to 
do on each part … It’s all about serving the part, it’s 

all about serving the song … I’ve kind of taken an 
approach of stepping back a little bit and just having 
the guitar sit where it needs to. I’ve been learning 
how to do that, and I still have a little ways to go. But 
I think this effort, at least, is a lot more glued and 
cohesive around the board.

AT: What you’re describing is more of a 

conversation than just you presenting a finished part. 
Do you see that maybe extending to your drummer 
Zev Rose and your bassist Bill Crook in the future, 
where you’re all having a more open conversation?

MS: I’ve always written and recorded the bass. 

I don’t know if that will change. Zev actually did 
collaborate with me on this album, and I’m really 
happy that he did. He’s an incredible drummer, and 
I can only do so much … Zev and I would go back and 
forth, where I would present him something and 
then he would go on the e-kit and actually perform 
the parts and add some extra flair. That made it so 
much better because you can only program drums 
so much. The moment that you can actually take 
the performance of someone’s hands and put it in 
there, it’s a whole ’nother ball game …

To whatever poor, tortured soul occupies 

this apartment next, 

You will earnestly swing open the heavy front 

door, gleaming with a streaky coat of clinical, 
blueish-purpleish-greyish paint, and you will 
smell mold. You’ll learn to grow accustomed to 
the scent — no obscene amount of Febreze or 
air freshener plugs will ever succeed in masking 
it — but it will make you flinch upon entry. 
Unfortunately, this will be only the beginning of 
your torrid love affair with Apartment #1. 

You’ll walk into the bathroom and look up at 

the ceiling, only to find it sloping downwards 
to greet you, slick with an impenetrable coat 
of orange stains and stray hairs embedded into 
the paint. You’ll wonder if you had come to the 
wrong address; this is not the shiny, pristine 
apartment you were advertised through the 
realtor’s photos. It’s on you, after all, for not 
questioning why they weren’t willing to let you 
tour any units prior to your arrival.

Do not expect the fridge to always work. Or 

any of the lights, for that matter. Your apartment 
is prone to power outages, water shut-offs and 
a plethora of other issues that are just enough to 
begin eroding your already wire-thin nerves. 
Your “sent” mailbox will become cluttered with 
emails filing for countless work orders so that you 
can shower or wash your laundry or repair the 
flooding toilet that had you and your roommate 
ankle-deep in dirty water for an entire evening. 

Apartment #1 is, for all intents and 

purposes, a hellscape. Your roommate will joke 
that it isn’t meant to sustain human life: it’s the 
seventh circle of hell, or a cosmic joke or some 
bizarre purgatory you’ve been condemned to 
as penance for 20 years of bad karma — it must 
be. No other explanation seems to make sense. 
But if your experience is anything like mine, 
Apartment #1 is not just a subpar place for you 
to reside during your sophomore year. It will 
prove to be so much more than that.

— 

It might be the place where you have your 

heart shattered into a million pieces. 

You’ll get the call on an unassuming August 

morning, rousing you from a deep sleep. (If 
you’re like me, you’re curled up on a mattress 
pad sans mattress, resting atop a half-built bed 
frame). You’ll know what the call is about before 
you answer, and you will never hate being right 
more than you do when you hang up the phone 
a brief twenty seconds later. You come away 
from the call with no flowery summation, no 
eloquence or profundity or understanding, 
nothing at all except the truth: your world is 
heavy and someone you love has just died. 

Your family will leave the country the next 

day for the funeral, and they will be gone for 
months afterward.

Your room will be cold for weeks.

—

You will lie in your bed, finally sporting a 

mattress, one October night. Your body will 
be tugged in and out of sleep, eyes heavy from 
the day’s exhaustion and body heavier from 
the weight of your bones and the world and 
whatever else. They’ll flutter open and peer 
up at the window situated over your head, and 
behind the slits of your shutter blinds, you’ll be 
met with another pair of eyes.

Pressed against the glass stands a man, and 

you’ll realize he has been watching you sleep. 
You will not know how long he had been there, 
or why. But you will never forget the shape of his 
boots, with tattered laces and fresh dirt clinging 
to the worn leather, the eerie stillness of his 
stature, the dark shadows cast over his face and 
the unplaceable coldness behind his unblinking 
eyes. He will not move. Neither will you. 

Then you will scream. He’ll vanish just as 

soon as he realizes you’ve seen him, and your 
roommate will storm out of the apartment 
minutes later in search of him, only to find a 
blanket of darkness.

You’ll write it off as a harmless peeping 

Tom. You’ll blame it on the basement-level 
apartment, call yourself silly for daring to place 
your bed near the window. You’ll tell your 
friends the story, elaborate and humorous, 
frantic hand gestures and laughs masking 
the discomfort that lays beneath it all. But you 
will have nightmares; rolling in your bed and 
strangled by an indiscernible sense of dread, 
you will fight off the insidious understanding 
that you are a woman and that means being 
watched while you sleep, that you are the 
property of everyone but yourself and that even 
your own bedroom cannot belong to you. 

You will buy blackout curtains.

— 

The kitchen has just enough counter space 

for a microwave, and you will have to suck in 
your breath to slide past your roommate each 
day, narrowly ducking towards the fridge or 
cabinets. 

In the months spent shrinking under the 

grim fluorescent light, you will have to eat 
again. Winter is fierce, nipping away at you 
with unrelenting cruelty, and the gnawing 
pangs of hunger will slowly subside into a dull 
nothingness that sits in the pit of your stomach 
for weeks. You will have to relearn the hard-
wired, evolutionary underpinning of survival, 
and you will feel silly and incompetent and 
heavy, so heavy.

When the fall semester commenced, I 

finally had the amazing opportunity to meet 
many of my fellow Michigan in Color writers 
in person for the very first time. Nearly every 
single person I’ve met so far has asked me 
something along the lines of: “So, how do 
you write those horoscopes?” I always try to 
stammer out a response that isn’t too long-
winded but still encapsulates the process, 
even though it always ends up sounding like a 
different language to the other person. 

There is a misconception that horoscopes 

are just completely made up by the writers. 
However, they actually require a lot of research. 
Horoscopes are based on various astrological 
events in a given time frame. In astrology, 
space is divided into twelve 30-degree circular 
sectors that encompass all of the planets in our 
solar system. Each 30-degree sector is what we 
call an astrological/zodiac sign. In my weekly 
column, I mainly focus on planetary ingress 
(planets moving from one sign to another), 
transits/aspects (the angles that planets make 
with each other), retrogrades (when planets 
appear to move backwards) and both full and 
new moon phases (signals of the start or the 
end of a life cycle). 

The first step in my writing process is to 

find out which events are occurring each 
week. I always use cafeastrology.com to track 
each event every week, and then I compile all 
of the planetary movements and the dates and 
times at which they occur under the “Celestial 
Motion” section that appears at the top of 
every horoscope I publish. I use this section 
as a general guide so I don’t need to waste 
space on dates and information applicable to 
all signs in the individual zodiac sign sections. 
However, I don’t put the general information 
into paragraph form until I’ve finished writing 
each sign’s messages so that I know what topics 
I mention most throughout the piece and I 
can ensure my general information will set 
up the readers to understand their individual 
sign messages. I also know that people often 
skip the Celestial Motion section, so I want to 
make sure that everything within the zodiac 
messages can stand on its own.

Up until this point, my process requires 

little effort since I’ve only taken down dates so 
far. Now that I’m ready to write the individual 
zodiac sign sections, I need more information 
that is zodiac-sign specific.

I base my zodiac sign section on the type 

of astrological event, the planets involved, 
the signs of the planets and the astrological 
house(s) (another rotating wheel split into 12 
sectors just like the zodiac wheel). The house 

wheel makes one full rotation every two 
hours, which is why it’s important to note the 
exact time that these transits occur. There are 
different ways to determine where the houses 
start and end, but I use the Whole Sign House 
system, which neatly aligns the houses to the 
zodiac wheel. To find where each planet fits 
into a house, I use a website to draw a birth 
chart for the date and time of each event I want 
to track.

You might know that each sign has its own 

properties: Aries is the sign of passion and 
anger, Taurus is the sign of love and luxury 
and Gemini is the sign of communication 
and intelligence. However, each planet also 
has its own set of properties: Mercury is the 
planet of communication, Venus is the planet 
of love, Mars is the planet of anger and passion 
and so on. Houses also have their own set 
of properties: the first house deals with self-
identity, the second house deals with money, 
the third house deals with communication 
and so on. While signs and planets typically 
deal with areas of someone’s personality, 
houses represent an area in a person’s life. For 
instance, if your birth chart has an Aries Sun in 
the seventh house of partnerships, your Aries 
sun traits of passion and straightforwardness 
will manifest in your relationships.

This is where things start to get pretty 

complicated; houses in horoscopes aren’t 
exactly the same as house placements in natal 
charts. The houses are labeled from numbers 
1 to12, and the planets fall somewhere in these 
divisions. When interpreting birth charts, you 
simply mark down the number of the house 
that contains the planet. For example, if Venus 
falls inside the house labeled fifth on the birth 
chart, we would say that Venus is in the fifth 
house; it’s pretty straightforward. While I 
haven’t been able to find exact instructions 
on tracking houses in any astrology-related 
articles online, I have read many other 
horoscopes and noticed patterns in the 
definitions of the houses and the descriptions 
of each sign’s horoscope. First, locate the 
planet of interest on the chart. Next, look at the 
sign and the house that contains the planet. 
Regardless of the numbers displayed on the 
chart, I assign this house as the first house for 
this sign. Each sign has its own definition of 
houses, and the house containing the planet in 
question is always assigned as the first house. 

The next numbers in the sequence are 

assigned to each house in a clockwise 
direction. Since I want to know the planet’s 
house number for every sign, I just go counter-
clockwise around the circle. For example, 
let’s say that Mars’ orbit has led it into Libra’s 
sector of the sky. This means that for Libras, 
Mars is in their first house. Virgo is one sign 
counterclockwise of Libra, meaning its first 

house is one house counterclockwise of 
Mars’ current position. Houses are counted 
in a clockwise direction, so Mars is located 
in Virgo’s second house. Leo is two signs 
counterclockwise of Libra, so this means 
Venus is in Leo’s third house. Continue with 
this cycle until each zodiac sign has a house 
number assigned to every planet with a 
notable planetary event.

According to the event type, planet, sign 

and house, I can get an idea of what astrology 
predicts will happen. Using our earlier 
example, we will say that Mars is moving into 
the sign of Libra. Now, I want to know what 
this means for Capricorns. Capricorn is nine 
places away from Libra counterclockwise, 
so we know that Mars is in Capricorn’s tenth 
house. When a planet changes signs, it takes 
on qualities of the sign and house it enters. 
Mars is the planet of passion, Libra is a sign of 
diplomacy and the tenth house is the house of 
career and ambition. From this information, 
I would say that Capricorns will have some 
sort of breakthrough at work, and they should 
communicate their ideas with their coworkers 
and managers in order to progress. Repeat this 
process for every astral event for every sign.

Once I’ve finished writing for every sign, 

I go back to the Celestial Motion section and 
note all the general information that I don’t 

cover in the zodiac sign sections or information 
that I think is useful for all interpretations.

These are pretty much the essential 

components of my horoscope configuration. 
There are other concepts I include in my 
horoscopes such as ruling planets that I didn’t 
include here, and there are concepts like moon 
signs, chiron and minor aspects that I don’t 
even include in my horoscopes because, in my 
opinion, they are too irrelevant and excessive 
for a weekly horoscope. The amount of time 
I spend on each horoscope depends on the 
number of events per week, but they can range 
anywhere between two to six hours.

I cannot speak for every astrologer, but this 

is my method of writing horoscopes. As far 
as I’m aware, there is no definitive guide for 
horoscope writing, and I don’t particularly 
think there should be. While astrology is a 
practice with pretty defined guidelines, I 
think it’s important for people to define their 
belief system for themselves.

blurry memories 

of sleepy car rides home

with everyone asleep 

but dad and me 

he points to the moon

and says to me,

if you look at the moon 

it looks back at you 

can you spot it?

he asks

it can always spot you

he tells me tales of when he was young

clouds of smoke would fill the sky 

and leave the night with darkness

monsters lurked in the trees

the city lay asleep

but he was wide awake

not one star to light the way

but the moon always did

he tells me about his bike rides at night

coming home later than he should

he would look at the moon

and they would return together

safe and sound

he tells me how he thought

there couldn’t be just one moon

after all,

how could only one moon always know 

his every move?

he had me convinced

and still does,

for my child-like mind 

finds comfort 

that in the scary darkness

the moon will light my path 

now as i walk

to my home away from home

i glance up at the moon 

just every now and then

and i can’t help but wonder

is he looking at the moon too?

As my 20th birthday creeps around the 

corner, I’m grappling with a lingering feeling 
of whiplash. Time has been racing by and I’m 
short of breath trying to keep up. It feels as 
if it was just yesterday that I was celebrating 
my 18th birthday in my basement with my 
friends back home. But the clock doesn’t slow 
down for anyone. Even though the days feel 
painfully slow, time passes by quickly when 
you’re living through a global pandemic. This 
has also meant downing more hard-to-swal-
low pills than I had accounted for. Neverthe-
less, in approaching this threshold into a new 
chapter of my life, I’ve had time to reflect 
on the past and the future, as daunting as 
it seems. The growing pains have not been 
easy, but they’re a rite of passage through any 
significant life transition.

For me, growing up is realizing that most of 

the time, life isn’t going to be like the movies. 
It’s so easy for me to get caught up in the overly 
romanticized depictions of adolescence that 
saturate the media. Spending a lot of time 
engaging with such media while growing 
up had me wondering when I was going to 
finally have my quintessential coming-of-
age moment — something akin to the iconic 
tunnel scene from “The Perks of Being a 
Wallflower” where Emma Watson gracefully 
stands up in the trunk of a moving pick-up 
truck under the city lights of the Fort Pitt 
Tunnel, or the scene in “Lady Bird” where 
Lucas Hedges and Saoirse Ronan are joyously 
running through a vineyard. There was a 
point at which I had to realize that, in most 
aspects, my experiences won’t be the same 

as the main characters in my favorite movies. 
A lot of the time, life feels less like the idyllic, 
rose-tinted, peaceful drive scenes of an A24 
film and much more like an experimental 
film: shaky, unpredictable and confounding. 
Still, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and last 
spring made that very clear to me. 

In March 2020, my friends and I were 

trying on our graduation gowns and 
planning for what was supposed to be the 
quintessential prom night. By the next 
month, these milestones were taken from us 
in the blink of an eye, leaving us all feeling 
cheated by the world. 

Fortunately, at the end of our school year, I 

got the chance to end my own pity party. On 
our graduation day, rather than tuning into 
an unceremonious virtual commencement 
ceremony, I spoke at a local Black Lives 
Matter vigil during the peak of national 
protests. I got to speak about local social 
injustices in our hometown and organize 
with community members to plan future 
initiatives to promote racial equity. Even 
though my senior year didn’t conclude how I 
expected it to, I got to be a part of something 
bigger than myself last summer. Since then, 
I’ve found much more long-lasting joy in 
letting go of unrealistic expectations for how 
my life is “supposed” to look. I now appreciate 
any time spent with loved ones more than 
ever, whether we’re riding the train on an 
adventure through the city or just laying 
around binge-watching “Gossip Girl.”

Growing up is coming to terms with the 

fact that not all of my closest friendships 
will last forever. Whether we drift apart 
naturally or harshly cut off all contact, some 
friendships are just bound to end. After 
such an abrupt ending to my high school 

experience, this was made even more clear 
to me. I’ve had unfortunate falling-outs with 
people I once considered to be my ride-or-
dies. This is just a testament to the truth that 
at such a time in my life, when everybody is 
moving in different directions, relationships 
can be very impermanent. Even people that 
I’ve held close to my heart can be gone as 
quickly as they came. While this was one of 
the hardest pills to swallow, I’ve learned the 
importance of appreciating moments with 
the people around me for as long as I can and 
not spending too much time grieving faded 
friendships. 

Growing up is also realizing that I don’t 

always have to act grown. I don’t think 
I’ll ever fully grow out of my youth. 
And that’s okay. Though it isn’t 
always 
easy 
when 
scrolling 

through the latest news headlines, 
I’d hate to ever reach a point at 
which I’ve become entirely jaded 
by the world. Still, I think being 
able to silence my inner cynic at 
times is a necessity to maintain 
some peace of mind. For a while, 
I thought that one day I’d wake 
up and all at once be launched 
into adulthood. I figured that 
when the clock struck midnight 
on my 18th birthday, I would 
instantly be a grown-up. Yet 18 
felt the same as 17, except with the 
ability to vote and finally own my 
own Costco card. 

Even now as I’m reaching 20, I don’t 

feel too far removed from who I was 
two years ago. My friends and I still 
like to send each other stupid memes 
and make funny TikToks. Now, I just 

have to schedule time every now and then 
to file my taxes or tweak my resumé for 
a job application. The transition is much 
more gradual than I thought it would be. 
It’s as if I’m indefinitely teetering on the 
line between childhood and adulthood. 
Maybe I’ll be balancing on this line for a 
while, but I’m slowly beginning to find 
comfort in this “in-between” phase, 
especially with the knowledge that my 
peers feel the same way. I surely don’t 
have everything figured out yet, but really, 
who does?

Navigating this turbulent crossroad 

between 
adolescence 
and 
adulthood 

is anything but easy. It has been full of 
winding roads, sharp turns and dead ends. 
But I wouldn’t want the ride to be any 
other way. I’m surrounded by friends and 
family that I love very deeply, and I am 
better equipped now than ever to handle 
any curveball thrown my way. Usually, 
my birthdays are a bittersweet time for 
me. While it’s a time for celebration, it also 
means an increasing load of responsibility 
and having to confront my fears of the 

future. But this time around, I’m 

trying to face my 20th solar 

return with confidence that all 

things will work themselves 

out for the better. Cheers 

to growing older, 

in 
all 
of 
its 

perplexing 
glory.

Core memories in poems

amma opens the top drawer

of the dresser that’s older than i am

and pulls out a chain

it lays twisted but not tangled

it glitters but does not sparkle

it is old yet it feels so new

for i have never seen it

but i know already 

i love it

the chain wraps around her hand

waiting to be worn around my neck

amma hands it to me reluctantly 

she urges me to not lose it

are you too young for this?

she thinks out loud

but gives it to me anyway

and i wear it proud

the moon and my father

Design by 

Sophia Kamien

the necklace and my mother

proud of my mother 

who spent her first paycheck on this gold

proud of my mother 

who wore this gold when she got married

proud of my mother

who immigrated to the states with this gold 

proud of my mother 

who is always so proud of me

always wear it inside your shirt

she fearfully says to me 

you can’t lose it

she cautions me again 

i’ve worn it for seven years now

and i always will

because for the first time 

i think to myself

maybe something gold can stay

By Meghan Dodaballapur, MiC Columnist

Every now and then, I need to remind 

myself why I write. 

Especially on days where I sit in front 

of an empty Google Doc for hours on end. 
Lately, that’s been every day. Days in sun-
lit coffee shops and cafes where my fingers 
hover over the keyboard as I contemplate 
which thoughts should make it to the page. 
No, this one might be too corny. Maybe 
this one, but I can’t find the perfect words. 
Then there are late nights in the library 
where the only button I can seem to click 
is “delete.” 

I wish it were as easy as sitting at a desk 

for two hours and walking away with 
a draft at the very least. Instead, I find 
myself up at three in the morning typing 
away loose thoughts in the Notes app. 
Sometimes the sun sets into a beautiful 
pink as the perfect song (probably by Steve 
Lacy) begins to play, making all the words 
seem to come out just right. Most times, 
however, a successful day of writing looks 
like spacing out in calculus and squeezing 
out a dramatic line or two, like “I miss 
you, just not the way you made me feel,” in 
between scribbles of sinusoidal functions. 

And yet most often, the pressure of having 
six hours left to a deadline and iced chai 
lattes are truly what get me writing. 

By the time I’ve hit submit, I am 

convinced I’m a shitty writer. I think about 
8-year-old Zafirah telling anyone who 
would listen that I was going to be a writer. I 
remember how my mom nervously laughed 
every time I went into detail about traveling 
the world and writing stories along the 
way. I didn’t get it then, 
but now I nervously 
laugh at the thought 
of it too. She worried 
about me living off a 
writer’s salary, while 
I now contemplate if 
I can even become a 
writer. I am sure there 
are long lists of tips and 
tricks 
on 
improving 

one’s writing process 
— talking through one’s 
ideas, planning ahead, 
reading a whole lot 
more and so forth. But 
writing doesn’t exactly 
work like that for me. 
I can’t exactly plan 
how each piece will 
take a part of me with 

it. Writing in its simplest form is a way to 
get my voice and thoughts on paper. To 
write everything down allows the moment 
to live on forever. It calls for honesty and 
vulnerability, all while internalizing the 
inherent demand to sound great. And once 
it’s all out on paper and I see things I didn’t 
before, I start to understand my emotions 
and 
experiences 
with 
a 
heightened 

awareness. This clarity that comes from 

writing is a double-edged sword. While it 
brings peace and growth, it also replaces 
blissful ignorance with the pains of self-
awareness. So after the grueling process 
behind each piece, I have to ask myself — 
why do I write? 

I love writing, I do. I love writing long 

birthday cards, reminding others of 
how appreciated they are with run-on 
sentences and lots of adverbs, and dotting 

my I’s with hearts in 
lengthy love letters. I 
love writing about my 
plans for the day on 
pastel post-it notes or 
filling a blank page with 
entire dreams for the 
future. I love writing 
with authenticity and 
excitement, hoping my 
voice and emotion are 
heard clearly. I write 
like this because I 
remember how it felt 
to read as a kid. The 
way 
authors 
could 

craft whole beings and 
worlds 
with 
words 

was magical to me. 
Books 
presented 
an 

opportunity 
to 
live 

and learn through others. Even more 
special was how a string of words could 
easily make my heart jump. I aspire to be a 
writer who can make their reader feel. I’m 
especially thankful that I have the means 
to become that writer through Michigan 
in Color. 

But the truth is I write for myself before 

I do for anyone else. I write to remember 
all the delicate and pretty moments of life. 
I scribble down all the epiphanies, daily 
updates, growing pains and fears in a little 
blue book. I write to capture all that I feel 
onto a page or several. I want to be able to 
flip back and revisit these memories fondly 
through my words. I reread them months 
later with the foresight I didn’t have then, 
adding new reflections in the margins. 
I write to understand myself better as I 
continue to grow and live life to its fullest 
extent. 

So it’s okay if things are too corny or 

don’t sound entirely perfect because I write 
for me. And with the hope that my writing 
leaves the reader with a familiar memory 
or feeling. Right now, I’m writing this piece 
knowing I’ll revisit it a few weeks from 
now. It’s to remind myself that through 
writer’s block and shitty writing, it’s always 
a beautiful thing to give my thoughts a 
space to live. 

Why I write

S

ince our formation three 
years ago, the One University 
Coalition (1U) has called upon 

University President Mark Schlissel 
and the Board of Regents to provide 
the funds necessary to give University 
of Michigan – Flint and Dearborn 
campuses more of the opportunities 
already available on the Ann Arbor 
campus. As we see it, we have one 
University President and one Board 
of Regents; we are one university, and 
we should share resources so that 
all of our students — regardless of 
campus — can thrive.

The 
current 
budget 
model 

relegates the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses to a state of permanent 
austerity, constantly subject to cuts 
in programs, incapable of offering 
fair wages and offering only about a 
quarter of the support spending per 
student found in Ann Arbor. These 
disparities are unjust. The current 
budget model is also unsustainable: 
If we extrapolate the experience of 
recent years, the College of Arts & 
Sciences in Flint will be thoroughly 
hollowed out in a decade. The 
current model must change if we 
are committed to strong Flint and 
Dearborn campuses. 

From the start of our campaign, 

we have faced intense resistance from 
Schlissel and his administration. 
In June 2020, after two years of 
organizing, the president and the 
regents finally agreed to transfer 
an extra $10 million to each of the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses, but it 
took a majority of the regents voting 
down Schlissel’s proposed budget to 
make that happen. Since his budget 

passed, the president insisted that 
the extra $20 million for Flint and 
Dearborn would be a one-shot deal, to 
be spread out over three years, rather 
than be renewed the following year, 
as the regents favoring the transfers 
intended.

This summer the 1U campaign 

won two more victories. First, the 
Go Blue Guarantee (GBG) — which 
waives tuition for students from 
families with an income of less than 
$65,000 — was extended from Ann 
Arbor, where it was adopted in 2018, 
to Flint and Dearborn. However, 
while finally bowing to community 
pressure and regental authority, 
the 
president 
truncated 
the 

transformative potential of the new 
policy by introducing a minimum 
GPA eligibility requirement. There 
is no such requirement in the Ann 
Arbor version of the GBG, and it 
could halve the number of eligible 
UM-Flint 
and 
UM-Dearborn 

students. 

Our second victory came when 

the student governments of all three 
campuses came together in the Fund 
Our Future rally to announce their 
common demand that U-M commits 
$10 million per year to the Flint and 
Dearborn campuses for at least five 
years.

Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization, the union representing 
lecturers 
(i.e., 
nontenure-track 

faculty) on U-M’s three campuses, 
was already on the same page. When 
lecturers began negotiating a new 
collective bargaining agreement in 
January 2021, a core demand was 
that $15 million be transferred to 
Flint and $15 million to Dearborn, 
from funds controlled by the central 
(i.e., university-wide) administration, 
for each of the three years of the 
collective bargaining agreement. 

LEO members attached high 

priority to this demand for two 
reasons: They are committed to 
fair salaries for their Flint and 
Dearborn members without raising 
student tuition or provoking cuts in 
programming and they want to help 
dismantle the institutional racism 
and classism embodied in the current 
budget model. 

Commissioned by LEO, research 

by university budget expert Professor 
Howard Bunsis of Eastern Michigan 
University shows that the central 
administration could easily provide 
this level of increased support for 
Flint and Dearborn, notwithstanding 
the challenges of COVID-19. The 
$30 million per year (for the two 
campuses combined) is 1.3% of the 
Ann Arbor General Fund budget 
for 2021-22, but would be a 12.8% 
increase in U-M Flint’s General Fund 
budget, and a 9.7% increase in U-M 
Dearborn’s. 

Nevertheless, 
the 
president 

continues to publicly say no to such 
a change in the budget model. No to 
the student governments and no to 
LEO. Every time LEO presented its 
demand for $30 million for the two 
campuses at the bargaining table, 
the administration bargaining team 
crossed it out. LEO has made it clear 
that the change does not need to be 
included in the collective bargaining 
agreement, so long as it happens, but 
Schlissel seems uninterested in either 
approach. 

Why is the president who was 

proud to allocate $85 million to 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals 
on the Ann Arbor campus so opposed 
to applying DEI principles and money 
across the three campuses of U-M? 
We’re not sure, but the current budget 
model needs to change to align with 
our DEI values.

I

t’s another average Monday 
evening and I’m seriously 
hungry. Without fail, I enter 

a debate: Should I eat out, cook rice 
or ramen (yes, those two meals are 
the peak of my dorm cooking) or eat 
in the dining hall? Most nights, the 
dining hall wins, mostly because it 
feels free, and I can eat as much as 
I want. Tonight, however, nothing 
on the menu looks appetizing. I 
muddle over whether to get lamb 
marsala, beef stir fry or the classic 
pizza or burger. 

My gut reaction is to skip the 

dining hall and venture down 
South University Avenue or State 
Street in search of safe, dependable 
take-out. Convincing myself this is 
the right idea, I gather my things 
and prepare to leave my room. But 
wait. Something stops me. I didn’t 
come to the University of Michigan 
to operate within my comfort zone, 
including its culinary element. I 
came here to try something new.

A few days later, I am strolling 

through the Michigan Union, 
traveling back to my dorm for my 
3 p.m. political science class on 
Zoom. Suddenly, the study lounge 
— which bears a slight resemblance 
to the esteemed law library, in 
my opinion — catches my eye. 
Intuitively, I want to keep walking 
and plop down in the black leather 
chair that awaits me in my dorm, 
but I can’t help but feel that the 
moment is yet another opportunity 
waiting to be seized. I meander 
through the desks, the old wood 
creaking beneath me, take a seat by 
the fireplace and open my laptop. 

In my short time as a student on 

campus, I have made it a priority 
to challenge my comfort zone. 
Perhaps eating two plates of beef 

stir fry and taking a class in the 
Union is not the best definition 
of “spontaneous and exciting,” 
but for me, it is. The meal was 
delicious, and the hour spent in a 
Hogwartsian lounge will lead me 
to come back more often. Yet, I’d 
have never known about either of 
them if I hadn’t ventured beyond 
what is secure.

As humans, we like what 

we 
are 
accustomed 
to. 
The 

mere-exposure effect, as first 
developed by psychologist Robert 
Zajonc, states that “individuals 
show an increased preference 
(or liking) for a stimulus as a 
consequence of repeated exposure 
to that stimulus.” Additionally, 
we are guided by our brain’s dual-
processing systems. System 1 is 
our “brain’s fast, automatic and 
intuitive approach” to situations. 
System 2, comparatively, is the 
mind’s “slower, analytical mode 
where reason dominates.”

In 
taking 
these 
scientific 

observations together, it is no 
surprise that we prefer options that 
we are familiar with. Yet, aren’t 
we ever curious about that Greek 
restaurant we haven’t tried? The 
abstract red sculpture outside the 
UMMA? A class about something 
we have zero prior knowledge 
about? 

To 
some 
students, 
these 

decisions 
are 
nothing 
special 

and, frankly, while it may be 
understandable, 
it 
is 
equally 

disappointing. In underutilizing 
the resources available to us, we are 
failing ourselves. We are students 
at a university offering a plethora 
of diverse opportunities, both in 
and out of the classroom. Not to 
mention the varied combinations 
of foods, study spaces and shopping 
that we often take for granted. Even 
the weather has variety. Parking 
too — much to the displeasure of 

campus visitors — has its variety.

Quite simply, I’m baffled by 

the number of students who are 
stuck in a routine, let alone the 
same routine. Yes, predictability 
is good, but too much of it can 
be a detriment to our mental 
health. 
Winston-Salem 
State 

University 
psychologist 
Rich 

Walker found that people who 
“engage in a variety of experiences 
are more likely to retain positive 
emotions and minimize negative 
(emotions) than those who have 
fewer experiences.” Additionally, 
cognitive 
psychologist 
Gary 

Marcus notes that a greater sense 
of personal growth and purpose is 
associated with living life to one’s 
fullest (eudaimonia). 

As we enter the midst of club 

recruitment season, I challenge you 
to find an organization that sparks 
your curiosity — even if it’s not the 
exact resume-booster you seek. It 
is easy, especially as a freshman, 
to come here and fall prey to the 
exact same experiences you had 
in high school. One of my friends 
from home is rushing a fraternity, 
simply because he doesn’t know 
what else is out there. Students, 
don’t do that! Educate yourself, 
then seek out and participate in 
student organizations that provide 
internal satisfaction, not external 
validation. 

Perhaps I’m waxing poetic or 

sappy, but I’ve always believed 
that diversifying our experiences 
is what college is all about. There’s 
a whole world out there, and we 
only have so much time to live. We 
need to talk to that person sitting 
by themselves, go to a place that 
we ordinarily wouldn’t and try our 
best to shake things up at every 
juncture along the way. Otherwise, 
how will we truly know what we 
enjoy? Now, pardon me, but I need 
to get in line for more beef stir fry.

I

n 
early 
August, 
Apple 

announced some new child 
safety 
features, 
slated 
to 

arrive in the upcoming updates to 
iOS, macOS and iPadOS. The first 
change is that the Messages app 
warns minors (and their parents) of 
sexually explicit images and gives 
parents the option to be alerted if a 
child views or sends such an image. 
The second involves Siri and Search 
being tweaked to intervene when 
someone makes queries related 
to Child Sexual Abuse Material 
(CSAM) . The last, and most major, 
introduces 
automatic 
on-device 

matching of photos (stored inside 
iCloud Photos) against a database of 
known CSAM content. If the system 
discovers enough flagged pictures, a 
report will be sent to a moderator for 
evaluation. If the moderator confirms 
the assessment, Apple will decrypt 
the photos and share them with the 
relevant authorities.

These 
new 
features 
were 

announced with the stated intent 
of protecting children from sexual 
predators, and they do sound like 
measures with great intentions 
behind them. But the changes have 
been met with considerable backlash 
and feelings of betrayal.

Of the three features, the changes 

to Siri and Search have been generally 
uncontroversial. The others, however, 
have 
seen 
massive 
opposition, 

ranging from discontent about the 
tweak to the Messages app to outrage 

about the CSAM scanning. So much 
so that Apple was forced to delay (but 
not stop) the implementation of these 
features. 

It may still be unclear to you why 

there even is opposition or why I’m 
asking you to be scared.

Even if well-intended, these new 

features are a massive invasion of 
privacy and have the potential to 
inflict serious damage. Coming 
from Apple, a company that prides 
itself on taking customer privacy 
seriously (extending even into their 
advertisement’s music choices), this is 
a huge disappointment.

The 
largest 
change 
is 
the 

monitoring of peoples’ Photos app. 
Some might be tempted to think 
the detection process itself is novel 
and problematic. This emotion is a 
natural spillover from tech’s well-
documented issues with image 
scanning and detection. For example, 
studies show facial recognition 
software from IBM, Amazon and 
Microsoft have all underperformed 
for people of color and women. 
Recognition software is only as good 
as its training dataset. Train it on 
a homogenous dataset, and it will 
struggle with diversity when used. 

These are valid concerns, but 

they are not the whole picture. 
While it is not common knowledge, 
it is commonplace for major cloud 
service providers to scan for CSAMs 
hosted on their platform. This occurs 
with the help of a database of known 
CSAM content maintained by the 
National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children and a few checks 
to prevent false reports.

If this is an established procedure 

with checks in place to avoid false 
flagging, why is there backlash at all? 
The answer lies in where Apple is 
conducting these scans. 

Traditionally, all of this happens on 

a company’s servers which cannot see 
the contents of end-to-end encrypted 
data. Apple’s purported scanning 
will occur on-device, with an option 
to decrypt photos if need be. That’s 
very dangerous since end-to-end 
encryption doesn’t hide information 
from the device itself, which could 
lead to a potential backdoor for 
cyberattacks. 

Speaking of cyberattacks, Apple 

only recently came out with a 
security patch to protect iPhones 
from spyware attacks, which could 
turn on the camera and microphone 
on-demand and read messages and 
other local data, all without any 
visible sign. Apple, like any other 
tech giant, is only a few steps ahead 
of attackers at any given time (and 
perhaps a few steps behind as well in 
some cases).

This 
leads 
to 
other 
issues. 

Countries could put pressure on 
Apple to report photos it finds 
objectionable, such as photos of 
protests or dissenters. Will Apple 
always be able to say no? 

Even if Apple does manage to resist 

these demands, many companies sell 
software exploits that give access to 
devices to governments. These are all 
scary scenarios.

So while the cause for Apple’s 

new software updates may be 
noble, the risks are too high to be 
considered safe.

hether it be in Amazon

across 
the 

country or right here at 

the University of Michigan, unions 
and union activity have been making 
headlines in recent days. Unions have 
been relevant in American politics 
and life since the organized labor 
movement gained a foundation in 
1886, when the American Federation 
of Labor was founded. As we come 
out of Labor Day and approach a 
potential strike by the University’s 
Lecturers’ Employee Organization, 
it is imperative to think about the 
role of organized labor both in our 
community and beyond. Apart from 
delivering 
things 
like 
increased 

wages, safer working conditions, eight-
hour workdays and the concept of a 
weekend, unions play a critical role in 
the operations of a vast place like the 
University of Michigan.

Before last fall, when the Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization 
struck, 

I doubt most of us could name a 
single union on campus, let alone 
understand the varied roles these 
labor 
organizations 
play. 
Many 

students don’t realize unions — 
such as GEO, LEO, the American 
Federation of State, County, and 
Municipal Employees, the American 
Federation of Labor and Congress 
of 
Industrial 
Organizations, 
the 

American Federation of Teachers, the 
International Alliance of Theatrical 
Stage Employees and others — 
represent workers from all across the 
job spectrum at the University. 

From graduate student instructors 

to lecturers, bus drivers, hospital 
nurses, construction workers, stage 
crewmen 
and 
countless 
other 

professions, union work is what keeps 
the University of Michigan going — and 
sometimes grinds it to a halt. Whether 
it involves GEO, LEO or another labor 
organization, understanding striking 
and its implications is both timely and 
important. 

If you were on campus this time 

last year, you most certainly saw, 
participated in or at least heard about 
the GEO and Residential Adviser 
strikes that took place on campus. 
Between picket lines across campus 
and chants of “U-M works because 
we do,” the presence of a strike was 
unmissable.

A strike, or a work stoppage “in 

order to force an employer to comply 
with demands,” according to Merriam-
Webster Dictionary, is an incredibly 
powerful tool in a union’s arsenal 
when fighting against uncooperative 
management. Union strength comes 
from its numbers, promise of collective 
action and the possibility of a strike. 

Generally speaking, unions try 

to avoid striking due to the potential 
ramifications of such action. Unions 
can face a misguided public backlash 
if they withhold labor from producing 
a popular product or service. Union 
workers also do not get paid during 
strikes and rely on strike pay, 
something that can diminish or 
disappear if strikes drag out. 

In some circumstances, unions may 

even face legal consequences. In the 
state of Michigan, public sector unions 
aren’t legally allowed to strike. In this 
instance, however, it is important to 
note that legality and morality do not 
always go hand-in-hand; striking 
is a form of speech and should be 
protected whether it’s being done by a 
private or public union. When strikes 
arrive, they deserve respect. As Mary 
Manning, the famous flashpoint of the 
anti-apartheid Dunnes Stores strike in 
Ireland, was taught by her father as a 
child, “no one loses a day’s wages and 
stands in the bitter cold without a good 
reason.”

In GEO’s case last fall, the 

University’s lack of robust testing 
protocols, failure to provide sufficient 
resources for international students 
and unwillingness to provide graduate 
student caregivers with flexible, 
pandemic-sensitive childcare options 
were the tip of a dangerous iceberg. 
In addition, the University’s lack of 
substantive response to Black Lives 
Matter and policing concerns on 
campus was starkly apparent. 

After the University failed to come 

to an agreement with GEO regarding 
COVID-19 protocols and refused 
to have any dialogue surrounding 
policing demands, GEO voted to strike 
for a safer, smarter 
University 

reopening that wouldn’t needlessly 
risk the lives of undergraduates, 
graduate students, faculty, staff and 

the wider Ann Arbor community. 
While the strike ended under the 
threat of a cowardly legal recourse 
from the University, concrete gains 
were made to make the fall 2020 
semester safer for all.

In our own community, the 

GEO strike had a massive impact. 
While it was a bit disruptive to 
undergraduates for a week or two — 

again, disruption is the point — we 
were all safer because of it. While 
GEO’s strike focused primarily on 
ensuring the safety and health of its 
own members, the union’s successes 
were a victory for all students amid a 
deadly pandemic. 

As 
LEO 
continues 
to 
be 

stonewalled and gaslit by the 
University, the feelings of a strike are 
in the air. Regardless of whether or 
not University lecturers strike, here 
are a couple of things to keep in mind:

First and foremost, don’t cross 

the picket line in the event of a strike. 
“Crossing the picket line” is an 
expression used to describe shopping 
or working at a store or business 
that’s workers are on strike. When 
a union decides to strike, whether it 
be outside Angell Hall, the shopping 
mall or an online retailer, cooperation 
from the public helps strikers secure 
their goals, which are generally in 
the public interest. Crossing a picket 
line and purchasing a product or 
partaking in a service is a tacit consent 
of whatever the strikers are fighting 
against and makes strikes drag out 
longer as unions and management 
struggle over leverage.

Second, do research, understand 

labor laws in your state and advocate 
for positive change. At the federal 
level, consider supporting legislation 
like the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act. At the state level, push 
back against exploitative laws and 
union-busting practices. And at the 
local level, work to understand how 
your company or university interacts 
with unions or organized labor, and 
advocate that they treat workers and 
unions with respect and dignity.

Third, consider joining or starting 

a union. Labor has been and continues 
to be a strong force in politics and 

American life. Union representation 
and collective bargaining have helped 
the American worker secure political 
standing, increased wages, better 
working conditions and a host of other 
concrete gains. Unions have already 
helped you over the years in more 
ways than you probably can imagine. 

Respect and support Umich unions

I stumbled upon the article in bed 

in early 2020 on yet another sleepless 
night. As I absorbed the story about Dr. 
Robert Anderson and his sexual abuse of 
University of Michigan students, panic 
engulfed my stomach, and bile rose in my 
throat. Something was horribly wrong. 
I ran to the bathroom, vomited and lay 
down on the tiled floor.

A dark memory came into focus. One 

I had hidden from everyone, including 
myself, but that had interrupted my 
sleep for 25 years. I flashed back to the 
events in a cold examining room that 
shattered my world, my self-confidence 
… my everything. What took its place 
was twitching anxiety and unfathomable 
shame that would consume much of 
my life, leading me to question every 
relationship, decision and emotion I have 
had as a son, husband, father, co-worker, 
neighbor and friend. It also endangered 
my health: Since that day, I have never 
visited a doctor.
Y

es, I am a victim of Anderson 
along with hundreds, if not 
thousands, of other former U-M 

students. 

I have long been consumed by the why: 

Why did this happen to me? Why didn’t 
I say anything? Why did no one take the 
allegations seriously? Why didn’t the 
University protect me? Was I easy prey? 
Was I weak? Was I expendable?

I was a Michigan Man. A student-

athlete. As a Michigan Man you live 
by standards others dare to attain. We 
practiced, studied and played with every 
ounce of our ability. We pressed through 
pain because that was what the coaches 
demanded and what the fans wanted. You 
couldn’t have any chinks in the armor, 
and weakness was never an option.

And because I, along with the 

hundreds of other male student-athlete 

survivors of Anderson were “Michigan 
Men,” our experiences and traumas are 
largely unknown outside of Michigan 
and continue to be marginalized in a 
unique way. Because we were “Michigan 
Men,” the atrocities we encountered and 
traumas that continue to haunt us today 
are somehow lessened, swept under 
the rug in the shadow of our perceived 
strength and size. As if “Michigan Men” 
were built to endure the pain.

But I was a naive kid, only 18, which in 

retrospect was prime prey. 
I 

remember the moment I decided 
to no longer be Anderson’s victim. 
I had had enough. I ran from the 

examining room. My trust in authority 
was gone, as was my dream of being a 
U-M athlete. He had now stolen both. 

As a result, I quit the team that day 

to avoid Anderson and turned instead 
to Labatt Blue to camouflage my shame. 
Labatt turned into Jack Daniels, which 
turned into Nyquil. Thankfully, I stopped 
myself before it turned into something 
stronger. But by then, distancing myself 
from those closest to me had become my 
new norm.

The emotional vacuum I created 

eventually led me to jump from job-
to-job, 
industry-to-industry, 
friend-

to-friend. Instead of opening the door 
to 
relationships, 
I 
repeatedly, 
and 

purposefully, slammed the door shut just 
as I did the day I ran out of the examining 
room, vowing never to go back there and 
be hurt again.

But when I killed my association with 

the sport I loved, I killed my ability to 
truly love. I now realize how much I have 
missed in life by feeling so little and am 
working to communicate more freely 
with my family and friends. But I am 
also angrier than ever before about what 
happened to me and so many others. 

As student-athletes, we put our trust 

in the University and those around us to 
do the right thing on and off the field. We 
knew the University made money off our 

talents, filling stadiums with paying fans. 
It was a relationship we accepted. But 
maybe the relationship with the fans and 
the University is a facade, maybe athletes 
are worthless to the University if we aren’t 
winning. And most definitely, part of that 
relationship was being aware that our 
coaches would uncomfortably chuckle 
when appointments with Anderson were 
mentioned, as would other athletes who 
either had firsthand knowledge as I did 
or had heard through teammates that the 
rumors were, in fact, true. 
N

ow, 
experiencing 
how 
the 

“Leaders and Best” are ignoring, 
neglecting and overlooking our 

experiences as victims disgusts me.

The Michigan Machine that relied 

on us for revenue now views us as an 
uncomfortable chorus of complainers. 
The money we helped them make is 
now being used to hire law firms and 
investigators to minimize our existence. 
Staff, many of whom may still be working 
in the athletics department, likely knew 
more than they shared with investigators. 
Now, witnessing how the “Leaders and 
Best” are denying survivors transparency 
and attempting to avoid accountability 
for the decades upon decades of their 
institutional 
failures 
sickens 
me. 

Along with the acts of Anderson, the 
University’s lack of transparency should 
also sicken former and current athletes, 

students, staff, alumni and the public. 
T

o the largest alumni base in 
the world, to Michigan fans 
everywhere, to donors, corporate 

sponsors 
and 
prospective 
student-

athletes, I ask you to stand up as you do 
for us in Michigan athletic venues. Do 
what we did for you: rise up, persevere, 
press on. Tell University leaders we do 
not accept what happened, nor will we 
allow it to occur on any college campus, 
any institution or in any sliver of society 
again. Let’s uncover the uncomfortable 
truth about what really happened and 
change the conversation forever. Because 
that is what Michigan Men (people) do: 
We do what is right.

Ten months ago, with the Michigan 

football team trailing 17-0 in Piscataway, 
N.J., Jim Harbaugh turned to quarterback 
Cade McNamara.

The move was seen as a last resort. 

McNamara, then a sophomore, began 
the season third on the Wolverines’ 
quarterback depth chart behind Joe 
Milton and Dylan McCaffrey. He had never 
seen meaningful game action, but after the 
former played his way to the bench and the 
latter transferred, McNamara was thrust 
onto the field.

He made the most of the opportunity, 

steering 
the 
Wolverines’ 
comeback 

win and saving the program from a 
catastrophic loss. He completed 27-of-36 
pass attempts for 260 yards and accounted 
for five total touchdowns in the 48-42 
overtime victory. But above all, he showed 
the leadership traits Michigan’s previous 
quarterbacks lacked.

“That’s probably the biggest statement 

you can make,” Harbaugh told reporters 
on Monday. “Coming into a game like that, 
that’s your opportunity. Seventeen points 
down, rally the team, comeback victory. 
That does a lot — that does a tremendous 
amount for your own confidence and the 
belief everyone has in an individual.”

Nearly a year later, that confidence 

has only grown stronger. McNamara has 
emerged as the Wolverines’ stabilizing 

factor, leading to a 3-0 start this fall. 
Even in Michigan’s run-heavy offense, 
McNamara’s consistency through the 
air maintains a valuable dimension of 
any college offense. Despite limited 
opportunities to throw, he’s completed 24 
of his 37 passes so far — a 64.9% completion 
rate — and has three touchdowns through 
the air, including an 87-yard bomb, the 
third-longest in program history.

McNamara’s early success dates back to 

the end of last year, when he went into the 
offseason as the program’s unquestioned 
starting quarterback. That allowed him to 
take on a bigger leadership role following a 
dismal 2-4 season in 2020.

“When something’s not right, he’s going 

to speak up,” fifth-year senior safety Brad 
Hawkins said. “He’s going to point it out. 
He’s a great guy, a great leader. He wants 
to be successful, he wants his team to 
be successful and he does everything he 
needs to do for the team to win. He’s a great 
leader. Everyone looks up to him. Everyone 
listens to him when he talks. He’s going to 
continue to be a great leader, he’s going 
to continue to play well and he’s going to 
continue to do great things.”

Immediately following Shea Patterson’s 

departure 
in 
2019, 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled to find a reliable pocket presence. 
That’s not for a lack of trying, though. 
While McNamara patiently waited his 
turn, others gave it a shot at the helm. 

Milton, for all his untapped potential, 

never panned out. McCaffrey decided to 
opt out and enter the transfer portal before 

last season even began.

Yet, any newcomers brought in to add 

depth to the roster haven’t been able to 
pry the job from McNamara. Texas Tech 
transfer Alan Bowman still hasn’t thrown 
a pass in a Michigan uniform. Five-star 
freshman J.J. McCarthy has shown 
flashes of special talent, but he lacks the 
consistency of a veteran like McNamara.

Since the two-year Patterson era ended, 

McNamara is the only quarterback to 
establish firm control over the job. He 
hasn’t earned it with style points or circus 
throws — rather, his fundamentally sound 
approach has set him apart.

“He’s been consistently good since he’s 

played in games,” Harbaugh said. “The 
ability to drive the team for points, that’s 
getting really impressive. His overall 
confidence, ability, time on task, reps … 
just like anybody when you play in a game 
and realize you can do this. Not as hard as 
it seems. Get better at football by playing 
football.”

When McNamara takes the field 

against Rutgers this upcoming Saturday, 
his journey from third-stringer to starter 
will come full circle. And his grip on the job 
has only grown tighter since leading the 
Wolverines’ memorable comeback against 
Rutgers 10 months ago.

“He capitalized on his opportunity and 

took the bit and ran with it,” Harbaugh said. 
“Got to give great credit to Cade for doing 
that, for having the fortitude to step in there 
and take the bull by the horns. And he hasn’t 
given it up, so that’s all to his credit.”

On 
Wednesday, 
Michigan 

running backs coach Mike Hart 
told reporters that his biggest 
regret from the 
Wolverines’ 
matchup 
against 
Washington 
was 
keeping 

Donovan 
Edwards 
on 

the bench for 
so 
long. 
On 

Saturday, 
we 

saw why. 

With just under seven minutes 

left in the third quarter, the 
freshman running back came 
barreling down the middle of the 
field with the ball in his hands and 
one thing in his sights: his first 
college touchdown. 

With just four yards between 

the line of scrimmage and the 
end zone, Edwards easily made 
it through, putting Michigan up, 
56-3. 

Edwards had picked up a 

handful of yards in the Western 
Michigan and Washington games 
— 27 and four, respectively — but 
he made his first true impact 
on the stats sheet this weekend 
against Northern Illinois with 
eight carries, 86 yards and two 
touchdowns.

Two minutes after his first, he 

found the end zone again. At the 
42-yard line, Edwards waited for 
the Wolverines’ offensive line to 
create an opportunity, and then 
he took it. Finding a hole in the 
Huskies’ defense, he outran every 
defender en route to a 76-yard 
touchdown. 

Together, 
these 
two 

moments were emblematic of 
Michigan’s offense this weekend: 
systematically 
grinding 
down 

Northern Illinois’s defense while 
creating and taking big offensive 
opportunities whenever it could. 
More than that, it kept the ball 
almost entirely on the ground. 
After receiving criticism for last 
week’s 
run-game-dominated 

performance, the Wolverines did 
pick up the passing game, securing 
233 yards in the air compared to 44 
against Washington. 

“That was a goal of ours going 

into the game. We wanted to rush 
for 200 yards, we wanted to pass 
for 200 yards,” Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh told reporters after 
Saturday’s game. “Felt like the 
timing is there, the execution has 
been there in practice.”

Yes, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

passing, but it wasn’t the driving 
force behind the offense. It was 
barely an afterthought. Out of nine 
touchdowns, only one resulted 
from a pass — an 87-yard bomb 

caught by junior receiver Cornelius 
Johnson. 

Michigan’s 
offense 
is 
still 

irrefutably defined by its run 
game. Saturday, the Wolverines 

registered 373 yards on 48 carries. 
In each game so far this season, the 
Wolverines have picked up more 
rushing yards than the one before. 
Michigan now leads the nation 
with 1,051 yards on the ground. 

This identity — an identity it 

seems offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis has been trying to find since 
arriving in Ann Arbor three years 
ago — could serve as a strong, stable 
foundation for Gattis to build upon. 
Even with the implied asterisk that 
comes with a win over an inferior 
opponent, a 63-point trouncing 
isn’t meaningless.

It’s an identity built primarily 

on the backs of sophomore Blake 

Corum and senior Hassan Haskins. 
The duo holds a combined 688 
rushing yards and 11 touchdowns 
this season. 

Going into the season, it was 

anticipated that the run game 
would be a focal point of this 
offense. 

“We’ve got really good running 

backs,” Gattis told reporters before 
the start of the season. “Those guys 
need the ball. We’ve got to make a 
firm commitment to run the ball. 
That’s how your numbers go up 
from that standpoint.”

Adding Edwards as a valuable 

third wheel adds stability to that 
strategy. 

“It’s 
so 
tremendous 
with 

(Corum) and (Haskins),” Harbaugh 
said. “You talk about that kind of 
tandem at running back. Each is 
so good. Add Donovan in there. 

Donovan, he’s quite the back 
himself. He does a great job with 
ball security, it’s important to him. 
Some people are just better at that 
than other people, and he’s really 

good at that.”

If Haskins and Corum are 

thunder and lightning, Edwards is 
a downpour: maybe not as flashy, 
but relentless and powerful all the 
same. This trio could be planting 
the seeds for an offensive identity 
that defines Michigan not just this 
season but for years to come. 

Or it could be a ceiling. Yes, give 

Haskins the ball and you can beat 
Northern Illinois. You can beat 
Rutgers and probably Minnesota. 
But Penn State? Ohio State? The 
Wolverines are going to struggle to 
find the success they’re looking for 
in the long term without an equally 
strong passing game. 

A common football truism is 

that the team that controls the 
rushing game usually wins. 

Think back to the Wolverines’ 

most recent triumph over the 

Buckeyes 
in 
2011. 
Michigan 

was focused on the run game. It 
outran Ohio State 277 yards to 137 
and the Buckeyes out-passed the 
Wolverines 235 yards to Michigan’s 
167. 

But 
a 
regression 
analysis 

published in the Sport Journal 
showed that having a first-half 
passing-yard advantage increases 
the probability of winning whereas 
an advantage in rushing yards has 
no effect. As such, the saying is 
probably a case of reverse causation 
— teams that takes the lead will 
likely pull ahead in rushing yards 
as well. 

Now, 
think 
back 
to 
2016. 

Michigan had an offense anchored 
by running backs Karan Higdon, 
De’Veon Smith and Chris Evans. 
The Wolverines started the season 
with a 63-3 win against Hawaii, a 
blowout that started a nine-game 
win streak. It was a good Michigan 
team, but in big moments it couldn’t 
pull through. 

An Iowa defense was able to 

stop the run game, and there was 
no passing game to fall back on. An 
intercepted pass in the third quarter 
caused the Wolverines to blow a 17-3 
lead against Ohio State. Michigan 
notched two passing touchdowns 
in its Orange Bowl appearance, but 
it wasn’t enough to prevent another 
loss to another ranked opponent. 

No one can say that 10-3 is a 

disappointing season. No one can 
say that the Wolverines weren’t 
good in 2016. 

But it didn’t hit the benchmarks 

of success that Michigan has set 
for itself, that Michigan fans have 
come to place their blind faith in — 
and it hasn’t done so since. 

If the Wolverines really hope to 

live up to their own expectations, 
they can’t rely solely on the run 
game. 

But, it’s a great place to start.

SportsWednesday: Is Michigan’s rushing game the floor or the ceiling?

Cade McNamara has thrown three touchdowns in three games this season.

GRACE BEAL/Daily 

Michigan’s run game has fueled its 3-0 record this season. But the run game alone may not be enough to shatter expectations.

Last November, the Michigan football team 

stumbled into Piscataway, N.J., on the heels of 
three consecutive losses and required three 
overtimes and a quarterback change to escape 
with a victory. The game made for a stunning 
indictment of the state of the program, exposing 
the depths to which the Wolverines had fallen 
in Year Six of the Jim Harbaugh era. 

Now, as Michigan prepares to face Rutgers 

again this weekend, the 3-0 Wolverines appear 
to be back on the upswing, causing others to 
take notice. 

“Sounds like Michigan’s back to being 

Michigan,” Rutgers coach Greg Schiano told 
reporters on Saturday. 

A calamitous 2020 season resulted in 

Michigan entering the 2021 campaign as a 
national afterthought, a first under Harbaugh. 
But that perception is beginning to change. 

Having outscored their opponents 141-34 

through three games, the Wolverines find 
themselves ranked 19th in this week’s AP Poll. 
And, according to ESPN’s SP+ metric, Michigan 
is the sixth-best team in the nation, sandwiched 
between Ohio State and Penn State. 

The obvious disclaimer is that these marks 

are both wonky and meaningless, by no 
means an indication of what is to come. Each 
of the Wolverines’ three opponents have been 
unranked — their stiffest competition was 
Washington, which dropped its season-opener 
to FCS level Montana. 

Michigan 
players 
recognize 
the 

insignificance 
of 
a 
national 
narrative 

themselves. 

“We’re just looking at it as if we haven’t 

won anything,” fifth-year senior safety Brad 
Hawkins said on Monday. “We haven’t done 
anything yet. Yeah, we’re 3-0, but we still 
haven’t done anything. We’re just gonna 
continue to play with that chip like we haven’t 
done anything, which we haven’t. That’s just 
where we are.” 

That mentality is quickly becoming the 

mantra for this iteration of Wolverines. After 
the season-opening victory over Western 
Michigan three weeks ago, senior defensive end 
Aidan Hutchinson offered, “We haven’t done a 
damn thing. We’re not content with this at all.” 

Senior cornerback Vincent Gray echoed 

Hutchinson’s sentiment, chipping in, “We 
haven’t done anything yet.” 

That phrase is a common trope among sports 

teams, often used as a way to restrain egos and 
focus on expectations. Now that Big Ten play 
and a subsequent uptick in competition are 

imminent, Michigan continues to adhere to 
that mindset. 

“We know as soon as we lose one game, 

everyone’s gonna be like, ‘Michigan sucks 
again.’ We’re just taking every game as an 
underdog,” junior linebacker Mike Morris said. 
“I feel like we’re underdogs against Rutgers. 
Everybody probably thinks we’re gonna lose 
that game. Everybody probably thinks we’re 
going to lose every game in the Big Ten right 
now. We’re just taking it as us versus everybody. 
We don’t care if that team is 3-0 or 0-3. We’re 
just taking it one week at a time and just kicking 
everybody’s butt.” 

The 
collective 
chip-on-the-shoulder 

disposition can in part be attributed to 
Michigan’s culture change, starting with 
the coaching staff — a common talking point 
through fall camp. In the offseason, Harbaugh 
turned his staff upside down, bringing in four 
new coaches in a youth infusion that instilled a 
new energy within the program. That vigor has 
carried over into the season, painting a stark 
difference through the first three games. 

“As you can see on the sidelines, we’re having 

a bunch of fun,” sophomore running back Blake 
Corum said. “Last year, when you looked at the 
sidelines, we weren’t having much fun. We’re 
dancing now, we’re cheering each other up. 
We’re here for each other.”

The true test of the team’s new culture 

will come with the inevitable adversity. And 
as it heads into the gauntlet of Big Ten play, 
Michigan is sticking to the same mentality it 
shaped in the offseason. 

“What we’ve done to this point is good,” 

Harbaugh said on Saturday after the team’s 
53-point victory. “But now, it really starts 
counting.”

On Senior Night, seniors lead 
Michigan to comeback victory

The Michigan volleyball team 

(7-2) cruised to an easy victory 
against Boston College (10-4) 
on Friday evening, winning 
3-0 in its final match Friday. 
The Wolverines jumped to an 
early lead as they took the first 
set 25-13 behind senior outside 
hitter Paige Jones’s five kills 
and junior middle back May 
Pertofsky’s three aces. 

“In the gym, we talked a lot 

about first contact, which is 
serving and passing, and that’s 
something that we really focus 
ourselves on,” Jones said. “First 
contact wins games, so if we can 
get them out of system and serve 
aggressive, it makes our lives 
easier on the defensive end … 
it’s like our staple of what we’re 
trying to do.” 

Jones played exceptionally 

well, slamming a series of kills 
at a speed too fast for the Eagles 
to 
handle. 
This 
aggression 

worked in the team’s favor, as 
she and Petorfsky finished with 
ten kills each throughout the 
match.

“Since my freshman year, I’ve 

been learning how to serve more 
consistently with the hybrid 
since it’s not something that I 
did before college, and we’ve 
put so much time into it over the 
years and really worked on a lot 
this year,” Pertofsy said. “We’ve 
been really working on location 
and tempo … I think that the 
communication is really open 
when I’m with my team and with 
my setters, so it’s really nice just 
to tell them what I need, or if it’s 
my fault.”

The second set was no different 

as the Wolverines carried the 
momentum from the first set 
to win 25-17. Part of Michigan’s 
overall success resulted from 
an emphasis on countering the 
Eagles’ style of play. 

“Early on, we knew that 

they run a really fast offense,” 
Pertofsky said. “We saw that 
when they played Dayton and 
so we scouted that, and early in 
the game, just made sure that we 
were set up out wide. Working 
from the outside in (allowed us) 
to make sure that we were on 
the pins.” 

Michigan 
did 
have 
some 

hiccups along the way. Early in 

the third set, the Wolverines 
found themselves trailing, 18-14, 
and called a timeout. Boston 
College turned four pancakes 
into kills, and the momentum 
was in its favor. The Wolverines, 
though, 
appeared 
to 
have 

regrouped after the timeout as 
they went on a 7-1 run to take a 
21-19 lead. 

“Their system is so fast, 

that when it’s clicking, it’s 
hard to stop,” Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen said. “But I don’t 
think you can sustain it very 
consistently. I really wanted 
to just talk about being patient 
but urgent. We needed to keep 
serving 
tough. 
They 
were 

passing pretty well during that 
time, but if you keep serving 
tough, sooner or later, you’ll 
get them. Even though they’re 
scoring right now, sooner or 
later, the errors will come and 
they kind of did.” 

After a loss to UNC last 

Sunday, Michigan has been 
on a hot streak, sweeping the 
Michigan Invitational over the 
weekend. With Big Ten play this 
week, the team looking to carry 
the momentum forward after a 
strong stretch.

Fifteen minutes into extra 

time, senior midfielder Meredith 
Haakenson collected the ball 
at the top of the box. After 
surveying the field, Haakenson 
slipped it past the defense to 
the foot of junior forward Dani 
Wolfe. Wolfe dribbled to the end 
line before finding sophomore 

forward Sammi Woods, who sent 
a shot just past the goalkeeper’s 
outstretched arm, into the back 
of the net.

Woods’s goal completed the 

21st-ranked Wolverines’ (1-0-0 
Big Ten, 7-1-1 overall) comeback 
2-1 victory over Illinois (0-1, 
4-4) on Friday. Despite trailing 
for nearly 80 minutes of the 
game and needing two extra 
time periods, Michigan’s strong 
defense and slew of offensive 
chances eventually propelled it to 
the win. 

The defense got off to an 

unpromising 
start, 
however, 

when an early foul by senior 

defender Janiece Joyner in the 
box led to a penalty kick for the 
Illini. 
Fifth-year 
goalkeeper 

Hillary Beall made the save, but 
the ball bounced off her hands 
onto the foot of Illinois attacker 
Makena Silber, who gave the 
Illini a lead just two minutes into 
the game. 

Despite 
senior 
defender 

Sydney Shepherd — who had 
started every game to this point 
— being unavailable, and Joyner 

going down with an injury in the 
15th minute, Michigan’s defense 
tightened up after the early goal. 
Senior back Alia Martin and 
junior midfielder Emily Leyson 
held the unit together as their 
replacements. 

“This is where you are very 

thankful that you have some 
depth,” Michigan coach Jennifer 
Klein said. “Typically (Leyson) 
plays in the midfield, but we slid 
her back there … She did a great 
job.”

But while Michigan’s defense 

rebounded, its offense stalled. 
Despite holding the ball in the 
offensive end for most of the 

half, strong defense in the box 
from Illinois prevented quality 
chances, limiting the Wolverines 
to six first half shots and 
maintaining the Illini’s one goal 
lead into the break. 

The Wolverines came out of 

halftime energized, doubling 
their shot total within the first 
10 minutes of the half. Still, 
many of the chances were 
not high quality with shots 
constantly being taken from 
the top of the box and sailing 
way over the top of the net. 
Though it outshot Illinois 20-2 
throughout the half, it would 
take until the 80th minute for 
Michigan to even the score, 
when the Wolverines earned a 
corner kick. 

As the ball flew in, Illinois 

goalkeeper Naomi Jackson made 
an aggressive move, attempting 
to punch the ball out of the box. 
Instead, it hit off her hand, right 
to the head of senior midfielder 
Raleigh Loughman. Loughman 
hit it up to Haakenson, who 
headed it into the back of the net, 
knotting the game at one. 

“I got to give credit to Raleigh,” 

Haakenson said. “It was a great 
ball … I didn’t really have to do 
much. She’s a senior, and I’m a 
senior … On senior night it was a 
present for all of us.” 

Though Michigan earned a 

few more chances throughout 
the rest of regulation, nothing 
resulted. The first 15 minutes of 
extra time carried on similarly, 
with the Wolverines creating 
chances but not capitalizing. 

Finally, in the 105th minute, 

Woods put the ball into the 
bottom left corner of the net, 
completing the comeback win. 

“Overtime is always a lot of 

high emotions,” Woods said. 
“Being the team that gets that 
golden goal is always a surreal 
feeling, but being the one to 
actually get that goal is even 
better.”

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team faced a tall task in its first 
Big Ten opponent of the season: 
No. 8 Maryland. 

While the Wolverines (3-3-

1 overall, 0-1 Big Ten) played 
the Terrapins (5-1, 1-0) close, 
they were not up to the task, 
ultimately falling, 2-1.

The first half was largely 

dominated by Maryland. It was 
able to dictate the tempo of the 
game with its ability to move 
the ball up the field, get traffic 
in front of the net and create 
numerous scoring opportunities 
though 
it 
wasn’t 
able 
to 

capitalize. 

The Terrapins’ best chance of 

the half came with ten minutes 
left on a mad scramble in front 
of the Wolverines’ net, but the 
defense was persistent. Junior 
defender Evan Rasmussen was 
key in getting the stop on the 
play.

The game remained scoreless 

heading into halftime with the 
Terrapins having a 6-to-3 shot 
advantage. Michigan hoped to 
limit their chances in the final 
45 minutes.

But 
as 
the 
second 
half 

kicked 
off, 
the 
Wolverines 

were unable to stick to their 
gameplan. Maryland’s offense 
was even more ferocious in the 
second half, creating numerous 
opportunities 
and 
drawing 

penalty kicks. 

Ten minutes into the second 

half, the Terrapins drew a foul, 
resulting in a penalty kick. 
Maryland 
midfielder 
Joshua 

Bolma buried a goal on a curve 
shot that just barely missed the 
gloves of freshman goaltender 
Hayden Evans. 

The Terrapins kept riding 

their 
momentum 
and 
just 

nine 
minutes 
later, 
scored 

another goal. Maryland’s trio 
of midfielders worked a tic-
tac-toe play which ended with 
Justin Harris scoring in front 
of the net. He broke through 

the Wolverines defenders and 
buried the goal to make it a 2-0 
game. 

Despite allowing two second-

half goals, Evans finished the 
game with eight saves. 

With the game winding down, 

Michigan was able to cut the 
deficit to one with a goal from 
senior forward Derick Broche. 
Broche scored off a nice pass 
from senior midfielder Kevin 
Buca which froze the Terrapin 
goaltender. 

Despite the late push by the 

Wolverines, 
they 
ultimately 

came up short. The Terrapins 
finished the second half with 
ten 
shots, 
further 
elevating 

themselves from their first half 
performance. Michigan failed to 
keep up as it only tallied six shots 
compared to Maryland’s sixteen.

If the Wolverines want to stay 

competitive in the Big Ten, they 
will need to breakout offensively, 
after only scoring eight goals in 
the first seven games. 

No players or coaches were 

available for comment.

A stitch in time: Fiber artistry during the pandemic

The World Is Ending, and All I Got Was This 

Dumb Sweater

I picked up crochet a few months before the 

world shut down. I’d been dabbling with sewing 
and embroidery in fall 2019, a few of the many 
crafts that had come and gone from my list of hob-
bies, when I saw a crochet TikTok that seemed 
doable. That’s how they get you.

I was trying (and failing) to crochet one of my 

first ever projects — a mask, inspired by Billie Eil-
ish at the January 2020 Grammys — when the 
University of Michigan sent students home. How 
fortuitous, right?

As the world collapsed inward, gatherings 

dwindled and commutes were eliminated. Many 
of us found ourselves trapped inside with a lot of 
time on our hands. Some replaced that time with 
baking, Animal Crossing or binging Tiger King. 
Some replaced that time with a ball of yarn.

When Information junior Julia Kaplan was 

sent home from school, she and her roommates 
tried out a few different activities to fill their 
empty schedules before landing on crochet. Most 
notably, Kaplan wanted to teach herself Adobe 
Photoshop. She quickly realized that a digital 
hobby was only exacerbating her online fatigue 
from Zoom.

“In the beginning of quarantine, I started pick-

ing up a couple of new hobbies, but they were still 
on my computer,” Kaplan said. “I realized that I 
just needed something tangible because staring at 
a screen all day is honestly exhausting.”

So Kaplan ventured into Kerrytown to grab 

two skeins and two hooks for her and her room-
mate from the local yarn barn, Spun. Kaplan 
brought the haul home and began to weave the 
yarn together into whatever she could manage.

“We just searched up YouTube videos of how 

to crochet, and we both sat in our beds for like two 
hours just trying to start it out,” Kaplan said.

The widespread accessibility and digital com-

munity surrounding the fiber arts flourished dur-
ing COVID-19. There were hundreds of YouTube 
tutorials and TikTok videos catering to beginners, 
encouraging people to think creatively about the 
possibilities these art forms offer.

LSA sophomore Nandini Arya credits this 

modern textiles Renaissance as the reason that 
she got into the craft. Arya never saw herself as a 
crochet artist. Her only association with knitting 
was the chunky sweaters Molly Weasley knits for 
her kids in Harry Potter. But when she saw a Tik-
Tok of a Perry the Platypus amigurumi, inspira-
tion struck.

“I looked at like four YouTube tutorials and 

decided it was achievable,” Arya said.

From then on, Arya would take to crochet in 

“bursts,” a few days on and then a few days off, 
following tutorials and churning out projects. She 
started with beginner videos and worked her way 
up the levels of difficulty. Arya still calls herself a 
beginner. When I argued that she must be at least 
intermediate at this point, she insisted that she 
thought her friends would disagree.

Regardless, Arya continued to drill the differ-

ent techniques for hours at a time. Sometimes, 
she would spend all day on a project — and she 
wasn’t alone.

“I remember our friends forced us to leave (our 

bedroom) because we got so into it so quickly,” 
Kaplan said.

This sudden, all-encompassing obsession was 

a common theme among lockdown fiber artists. 
There were days when I would spend hours toil-
ing over a needle and yarn. The sun would set 
before I realized how much time had passed.

LSA senior Reagan White also found her foray 

into crochet devolving into obsession. White start-
ed a private Snapchat story with her best friend for 
the sole purpose of swapping crocheting tips and 
tricks. They were both novice crocheters but soon 
became enamored with the craft.

“I definitely did it every day during lockdown, 

24/7, even in times I maybe shouldn’t have,” 
White said.

Fiber arts are a great hobby because they can be 

done with only part of your attention. Many craft-
ers, myself included, would use this time to catch 
up on their favorite TV shows, chat with friends 
or even attend online class. White found that the 
practice actually helped her focus on whatever 
else she was doing.

“I have ADHD, so it’s really helpful for me to be 

doing something with my hands while I’m listen-
ing or watching something,” White said. “It helps 
me digest the information that I’m consuming.”

As a member of the community service frater-

nity Alpha Pi Omega, Engineering senior Ryan 
DaCosta learned to knit by making scarves and 
hats which were donated to shelters around Ann 
Arbor. DaCosta began knitting recreationally 
when lockdown went into effect and spent a good 
amount of time practicing when in isolation with 
COVID-19 early on in the pandemic.

“At the beginning of quarantine, I was knitting 

probably every day because being at home and 
being online for a while, there’s not much to do,” 
DaCosta said. “It’s also kind of a stress-reliever.”

DaCosta also found himself splitting his atten-

tion between knitting and other tasks. He enjoyed 
having something simple and repetitive to occupy 
the part of his mind insistent on wandering.

“It’s a great way to divide your attention while 

still staying engaged,” DaCosta said. “Being able to 
get that energy out while still focusing was really 
helpful.”

Kinesiology sophomore Sage Feldbruegge, 

who learned to crochet from her mother at a 
young age, was inspired to take it back up after her 
sister came home during lockdown and gifted her 
a new handmade cardigan. She wanted to be able 
to someday return the favor.

“I want to be able to make things for myself 

and not have to rely on my sister to ship it to me 
from her apartment when she moves back,” Feld-
bruegge said.

As a self-proclaimed “multitasking kind of 

person,” Feldbruegge shared that she rarely cro-
chets without some secondary source of enter-
tainment to accompany the task. That being said, 

Feldbruegge was doubtful of her ability to crochet 
during a movie she’d never seen before, much less 
while attending Zoom classes.

“I don’t think I could be one of the people that 

crochet in class,” Feldbruegge said. “I would learn 
things, but I would forget them. Because I would 
start counting my stitches, and I would forget to 
listen.”

That was certainly the case in my few failed 

attempts to crochet during class. And that’s okay. 
Crochet patterns get complicated fast, and it can 
be difficult to focus on something new in the back-
ground when you’re still building up expertise.

Feldbruegge said there were often times dur-

ing class where she would yearn to pick up the 
project. The half-completed sweater would taunt 
her, sitting there unchanged as the moments 
ticked by. It could be done, if only she could devote 
her full attention to it.

But eventually, Feldbruegge would find respite 

in a nightly Netflix binge, roommate hangout 
or dog sitting job. She would use the hobby as a 
stress-reliever at the end of her day, or simply a 
way to occupy the passing hours.

“I did a lot of crocheting before I went to bed,” 

Feldbruegge said. “I’d be like, I just want to finish 
this one part, and then I’d end up getting so into it 
that I’d crochet until the middle of the night.”

Repetition, Repetition, Repetition

When I was younger, my Bubbie armed me 

with all the knowledge of a good Jewish grand-
mother. I listened to her advice — learned to 
play Canasta and got pretty good at knitting 
(for a nine-year-old). But Bubbie told me I was 
spectacular, so rather than discard the needles, 
I tucked them away in my coterie of craft sup-
plies, never to be seen again. That is, until lock-
down.

Knitting, much like riding a bike or learning 

a language, is something that you never really 
forget how to do. This is especially true if you 
learn at a young age. It’s the kind of skill that’s 
all about muscle memory. Once you practice it 
enough, it becomes second nature.

The very essence of fiber arts is repeti-

tive. It requires the maker to stack stitch upon 
stitch upon identical stitch until suddenly, they 
coalesce into something entirely new.

“Watching the project grow while it’s in your 

hands, you can see your progress so clearly,” 
White said. “And even though some projects 
will take a lot of repetition of the same thing, 
you can see the whole bigger picture of it being 
built in your hands.”

This makes fiber artistry a particularly 

valuable skill to have during a months-long 
lockdown. Even though you’re not necessarily 
accountable to anyone for creating or complet-
ing projects, it’s nice to have physical evidence 
of your productivity — to be able to point to 
something and say, I made that!

“Especially with the last part of quarantine 

… it got harder to perceive time passing at the 
end there, so it was nice to know it actually hap-

pened,” Arya said. “To have proof that it did in 
fact occur.”

In the beginning, progress isn’t going to 

amount to entire blankets produced in a single 
day. Still, any change is good change when your 
daily routines are shattered and conventions of 
life are forgotten.

“One of the reasons that I love crochet is 

because you can see the little bits and pieces of 
progress so even if you just got one row, it’s one 
more row than you used to have,” Kaplan said. 
“It’s a very rewarding craft.”

And those rewards are certainly hard-

earned. It takes time to build up the muscle 
memory to be able to knit or crochet — typically 
up to three months. You must reap before you 
are able to sew (pun intended).

“It can be super overwhelming when you 

first get started,” White said. “It can be really 
foreign to hold the yarn in the ways that they 
suggest you do for crocheting and knitting as 
well. I think the best advice would be to just 
keep trying the same very simple tasks.”

Every single person I interviewed said some-

thing to this effect, and I completely agree. For 
beginners, there is a huge learning curve asso-
ciated with mastering the stitches and getting 
comfortable with the tools.

Arya advises newcomers to take things bit by 

bit. She recommends finding a pattern involv-
ing only one or two simple stitches to start out, 
because when you finally do make something 
successfully — even something simple — the 
ego-boost you receive is unrivaled.

“Once I made my first successful circle, I 

was so happy that I was like, ‘I can crochet any-
thing,’” Arya said. “And that was really the rea-
son why I kept up with it instead of quitting.”

Feldbruegge did quit after her mom taught 

her to crochet when she was younger. But hav-
ing started it back up again, she was determined 
to master the skill. A few months in, after prac-
ticing for countless hours, Feldbruegge started 
a new project: a hat. She was anticipating anoth-
er bout of days laboring over hook and skein, but 
after just an hour and a half, the hat was com-
plete. Feldbruegge went to show it to her dad, 
who joined her in shock over just how quickly 
she was able to produce the garment.

“The fact that I was not very good at crochet-

ing when I was younger and I just got back into 
it this year and was already going fast enough to 
get things done, like finish a project in one day, 
was just really cool to see,” Feldbruegge said.

Feldbruegge said that people new to the 

fiber arts should try out different methods of

I fill a significant portion of my spare time with 

dumb thoughts that strangers post online. I’ve 
been on the internet since the late-aughts, spending 
after-school screen time with Fred videos and 
Webkinz, floating from site to site on the family PC. 
The online world allowed me to be anonymous — 
even though I met “friends” on Club Penguin chats 
and GirlsGoGames comments, I was just a chaotic 
username, not Annie Rauwerda. My bubble of 
anonymity popped when my dad told me that the 
public comments I’d made on High School Musical 
videos (“Vanessa Hudgens is sooooo perfect for 
Zac,” etc.) were all associated with his name and 
that I should “please not do that.” 

I spent my middle school years under my actual 

name on Google Buzz and Facebook, poking 
and posting. By high school, the tech giants had 
hooked me on algorithmically-curated content. 
The 10-year anniversary of my Instagram account 
approaches, and I’m not sure if I should celebrate 
or mourn.

The internet hosts mazes of feverish 

connection; it takes our social incentives (to 
be liked) and disguises them as performance 
incentives (to get likes.) After I meet someone in 
real life, I search their name on the internet to get a 
read on their vibe — a habit that, when I take a step 
back, seems deranged. Why can’t my perception 
of a person be complete without knowing their 
online presence? In a digitally-mediated world, it’s 
easy to make life inextricable from social media. 
Many of the good and beautiful parts of life— the 
jokes, the inspiration, our communities and our 
families— are inseparable from the internet, too. 

People I’ll never meet are saying nothing and 

saying it all the time, and I’m frequently sucked 
into the abyss, viewing it all from my digital 
peephole. Opaque algorithms present me with 
curated content that updates every few seconds; 
apps send me FOMO-inducing push notifications 
when I haven’t logged on in a while. Occasionally, 
the trash vortex yields something useful, like 

this Chrome extension that hides pop-ups and 
long personal stories from food blogs. Other 
times, I’m absent-mindedly scrolling through 
acquaintances’ vacation pictures, wasting my 
time watching their carefully constructed lives. 

A stranger made a Rube Goldberg machine. 

Another stranger had a gender reveal at a ski 
resort (she’s a girl). More strangers had a reunion 
at an airport, and I watched until the end. I’m 
happy for them. Hong Kong now has a meme 
museum.

I become invested in the day’s happenings and 

I move to the couch to continue my scroll. 

Female octopuses throw things at males that 

are harassing them and a stranger thinks this is 
pretty hashtag girlboss. Now there’s shaved soap, 
a close-up of gloved hands popping blackheads 
and a picture of a frog that says “I live in Poland 
but the la is silent.” An ad for a bank for gay people. 
A mukbang. My brother’s ex-girlfriend did a 
Tough Mudder with her dad who has cancer and 
my high school nemesis is asking her followers to 
join her pyramid scheme. Vaccine disinformation. 
A cow got stuck in a tree. Someone changed their 
Tinder location to the Olympic Village and is 
matching with Olympians. Neat!

There’s a gif of a rapper above an Amber 

Alert above a deep-fried-meme above a notice of 
neighborhood raccoons above ASMR cooking 
tutorials above viral recipes for air-fryer tofu 
above a stranger’s açaí bowl above a 5-year-
old opening a neon slime kit. Rapper Nicki 
Minaj spreads misinformation, claiming that 
the COVID-19 vaccine caused infertility in her 
cousin’s friend, and reputable sources rush to 
correct her. My high school assistant swim coach 
marks herself safe from a minor hurricane. The 
New York Times Magazine ran an article about 
how to catch a bat, making me wonder if this is 
a skill I’ll ever need to know. There’s an ad for a 
dating app for dogs.

Rudy Giuliani is on Cameo. An influencer posted 

a picture in Cabo but when she photoshopped her 
small waist, she inadvertently made her thumb 
really fat. Timothée Chalamet was spotted eating 
a sandwich. The Daily Mail puts out another 
bizarre headline: “EXCLUSIVE: Tech bro boasts 
about hanging with ‘notable celebrities and execs’ 
at UNOFFICIAL Burning Man as rich kids bring 
their own stages, Porta Potties and DJ equipment 
to Black Rock Desert ‘Playa.’” A Russian content 
farm on Facebook asks if you can name a song that 
mentions the weather, and your parents’ next-door 
neighbor comments “It’s Raining Men.” I suppose 
she’s right, and I take a screenshot to send to my 
brother but never get around to sending it. A girl 
I met at a slumber party in eighth grade moved 
to Texas with her boyfriend. A BuzzFeed video 
shows how street lights work. Polka-dot bralettes 
are on sale. Bugs Bunny is wearing a tux and 
wishing “all darty-ers a very calm down it’s 9 in 
the morning.” A church youth pastor says that the 
new rec room has everything a teen could want: 
Blu-rays, a foosball table, a board game shelf and 
several types of potato chips. Someone posted a 
video of their “obnoxiously strong toes” and it met 
my (admittedly low) expectations. 

“Ali express is a beautiful name for a girl,” says 

a stranger. A multi-millionaire I’ve never heard of 
is quitting his job at a one-billion-dollar company 
to work at a different billion-dollar company, and 
a cat fell off the upper bowl of a stadium during 
a football game. Someone brings up the guy 
with two penises from Reddit. Someone thinks 
their chin looks like the city of Dallas. It does. 
Another meme arises based on a nostalgic form 
of children’s entertainment that people in their 
twenties enjoyed as elementary schoolers. A 
stretched, saturated stock image of Paris Hilton 
holding a massive Hello Kitty purse is overlaid by 
glowing yellow text that reads “I am so based.” It 
has 60,000 likes. Someone in a Twitter argument 
says “touch some grass,” an insult implying that 
one has lost touch with reality so entirely that they 

must interact with a plant and reflect on their 
actions. 

Like a lab rat with a lever, I wade through 

endless content in search of a meme that induces a 
strong exhale. I don’t know if the mess of content 
adds up to anything, but I do know it feels thrilling 
on good days and overwhelming on bad days. 
There are plenty of voices saying social media is 
bad — just as critics warned about TV (called a 
“vast wasteland” in 1961), or the once-newfangled 
concept of the written word, which Plato said 
would “implant forgetfulness.”

As someone who loves the way the media 

landscape always provides something new to 
learn, I don’t mean to be a Luddite. Still, when 
I don’t set limits, I find myself exhausted by 
it all. I mourn the way it can fuel hate groups, 
decimate mental health and pressure its users 
into constant performance. Huge concerts may 
have a stage in the middle surrounded by seating 
in every direction, but on social media, it’s as if the 
performers are in the stands and there’s no stage 
— we’re performing for no one but each other.

I have my gripes with the internet, of course, 

but I keep coming back to it for several reasons: 
I frequently find things I really like (like this 
101-year-old lobsterwoman) and it connects me 
to my friends. Gen Z has been dubbed “digital 
natives” because we grew up in close contact with 
the internet. The term implies the internet is my 
home country, and it sure feels like it: I speak our 
shared language of memes and phrases with a 
certain dialect, and I get a homesick longing for 
content if I go for too long without it. 

The other day, I saw in an online article linked 

from social media that ducks can learn to say 
phrases, and one said “you bloody fool.” 

“Maybe I am,” I thought, and then I scrolled to 

a tweet from user @afraidofwasps. It read: “You 
only live once — you should try to spend as much 
time on the computer as possible. After you die, 
you won’t have access to it anymore.”

I am single-handedly running Earth into the 

ground.

I know this because I had to calculate my eco-

logical footprint for my environmental studies class 
last Thursday. For reference, an ecological footprint 
is a measure of an individual’s personal impact on 
the environment — a comparison between the 
demand one puts on Earth’s natural resources 
versus what the Earth is actually able to supply. To 
determine mine, I answered questions about my 
food intake (how many animal-based or processed 
products I consume), what type of house I live in, 
my modes of transportation, how often I buy new 
clothes or gadgets and so on. 

Upon finishing the survey, the result page came 

up and presented me with the statement, “If every-
one lived like you, we would need 5.3 Earths.”

Ah jeez. I scrolled to the next statement. “If 

everyone lived like you, by March 9th, we would 
have used as much from nature as Earth can renew 
in an entire year.” 

“Oh gosh,” I verbally announced. I could seri-

ously be the sole reason we’re in a sixth mass 
extinction right now. 

I then turned to the response questions for 

the assignment, where I was asked how I could 
improve my footprint, more specifically, how 
I could “be the change.” I sat back and thought 
through my past week, trying to identify times 
when I had tanked nature’s future. 

From reflecting, I realized that while my ecologi-

cal footprint was through the roof, my actual foot-
print was 
possibly higher — 
my activity app 
measured 
18,000 
steps 
the 

other day. During my first week of 
classes, I was so overwhelmed that I 
called my mom crying from the floor 
of 
my 
bedroom. 

The 
conversa-

tion provided no 
huge insights into 
bettering my ecologi-

cal footprint, only proof that the 
Earth and I were actually in tough 
competition for exhaustion lev-
els — I’ve been energetically and 

socially stunted from the 

pandemic.

“It’s hard,” I panicked. “I don’t 

know how to do regular school. 
I have to walk to my classes. I 
have to figure out where to walk 
in-between them when I don’t have 
time to deep-dive into a huge assign-
ment but also have too much time to 
just eat a snack. Then I walk back and 
forth from the house all day for my meals. And 
of course, I have to interact with everyone while I 
do it.”

“You’re just not adjusted to regular life,” my 

mom told me. “You’ll get there.”

Continuing to reflect on my week, I thought 

about my first game day as a Michigan Wolverine: 
entering the Big House, chills rising on my arms 
as I looked down at the sea of students, beaming 
and cheering, all overjoyed about making their 
debut from two years of hibernation. I was again 
exhausted that night from such a surreal yet over-
stimulating day. 

I guess I could’ve skipped the half-time hot dog? 

Avoided food from animals? I laughed to myself as 
I pictured my Graduate Student Instructor reading 
my response that I’d “be the change” by boycotting 
stadium meat. 

The reality was, I had no idea how to fix my eco-

logical footprint. I had no idea how to even navigate 
normal life on campus, and here I was, trying to 
cough up ideas on how I could “be the change.” 
While I was unable to find a legitimate way to 
improve the Earth’s life, I had identified a pattern 
of overstimulation and tiredness within my own.

This week, a hundred percent of my effort has 

gone towards trying to figure out what floor of 
what library is a good spot to do my work, how 
much of the professor’s words I should get down 
as he spews into the unpausable abyss, and if I have 
time to stop at home for dinner or go straight to 
dance practice before then going out for the night. 
I may be a 

sophomore in name, 

but I feel like a freshman in mind 

and body. And I’m not the only one. 

My friends and I joke that we’re like astronauts 

who returned from space with bones and muscles 
ill-equipped to handle the pressure of gravity. It’s 

an odd concept — having to “catch up” to a 

“normal” life, struggling through what 

is supposed to be “an average day.” 

I, along with my entire age group 

and perhaps even the entire 

student body, am realizing 

that 
I didn’t know what I was 
missing while I was missing 
it. I regressed as a function-

ing, social human without even knowing.

Being a stranger to the school at which 

I spent a year of my life is weird. I knew 
the University of Michigan was a “big 
school,” but I didn’t actually com-
prehend its vastitude until I 
went to Festifall last week. 

My 
intentions 

included add-

ing a club 

to 
my 

repertoire 
— 

perhaps 
something 

would help me contribute 
to the community, to “be 
the change.” I walked 
around in awe, taking in 
the number of people, 
the diversity of stu-
dents, their styles, con-
versations, 
initiatives, 

interests. I walked and 
walked, read material at 
booths, analyzed the buzz-
ing Diag. Overwhelmed, I 
added no clubs. Suddenly, the 
ones I already belonged to suf-
ficed. I sympathized with the Earth 
as I left, unable to provide all the per-
sonal resources that felt demanded of me. I 
needed to listen to my own body and mind’s 
needs. 

I’m acutely aware that now is not the best 

time for self-focus, though. Within the past 
month or so, there’s been a deadly hurricane, 
an abortion ban, continued Taliban chaos, 
wildfires and more. Usually, I like to stay 
updated, know current events and contrib-
ute charitably wherever I can, whether that 
entails reading the New York Times at night or 
FaceTiming 
my family to discuss confusing 

details. I like to be able 

to understand issues and their 

players and participate in conversations 

with friends or in classes. I like being informed. 

But right now, I don’t feel like I have the capacity 

to do so. I don’t know nearly enough about any of 
these events as I should. In full transparency, I can 
say I know 

that they happened and that’s about it. My aware-

ness is not looking good — I feel civically irresponsi-
ble. Not to mention, I’m apparently taking down the 
environment, too.

Keeping up with the news, staying politically 

and globally educated, contributing to causes you 
care about and of course, staying relatively envi-
ronmentally friendly requires a concerted effort, 
regardless of the time period or what’s going on 
in the world. But as college students today, we 
are expected to keep up with the world beyond 
ourselves, while also re-learning real life here in 
Ann Arbor. I question if it is acceptable to hold off a 
semester on joining a new organization or if it is irre-

sponsible to know less about current events. 

Is it lazy to not have the capacity to figure 

out how to improve an ecological foot-

print? Generally speaking, I do not 

believe anybody has the privi-

lege to dismiss life and issues 

outside their personal 

bubble. It’s negli-

gent and self-

centered. 

But 
I 

also have a small voice — one which I’m afraid to 
let speak up — saying that right now, focusing on 
myself is OK. It’s OK if I skim the news when I can, 
engage in conversation when possible and provide 
a heartfelt contribution to bettering our environ-
ment at a later date. I’ve got to obtain the footing 
itself before I can shape my footprint. This means, 
at least for a little while, maybe I don’t have to hold 
myself to the same standards I did before the pan-
demic. Maybe I don’t need to “be the change” — at 
least for right now. 

This slightly disheartening, yet nonetheless 

unavoidable truth probably goes for all aspects of 
life: the bar that was achievable in 2019, is, at least 
for now, lower. We should be easy on ourselves. We 
should lower our expectations of what we can and 
need to do. 

Right now, I’ll “be the change” by making 

sure I healthily balance my academics, social life, 
extracurriculars and downtime. I’ll take things 
off my plate that nudge me closer to feeling too 
overwhelmed. I’ll reach out to my peers and dis-
cuss the difficulty of this adjustment that they 
may be too nervous to outwardly express, think-
ing they’re the only ones struggling. I’ll write 
this piece admitting that I’m not as politically or 
current event-ly fluent and active as I used to be, 
like to be or know I should be. I’ll get there soon 
enough. Soon I’ll genuinely work on “being the 
change.” 

First, I must figure out how to just “be.”

a non-virtual reality

NOLLETTE-PATULSKI, 

STATEMENT COLUMNIST

As I walk past the Undergraduate 

Science Building, the early September 
sunset paints a gradient from blue to 
orange on the reflective windows. I 
should be wowed by this: the brilliant 
sky, the comfortably warm weather, my 
first week back on campus. Instead, my 
mind wanders back to the streets of my 
youth. The suburban ones with single-
family ranches dotting the sides of the 
road, the quiet ones that couldn’t quite 
keep high-school me satisfied, the long 
ones that had iterations of car dealerships 
and fast-food restaurants for miles. The streets 
that resemble a midwest automobile wasteland. 
Yet here I was, eight days after moving in, yearn-
ing to touch the ground that I had so happily left. 

How did I get here?
I have lived in Grand Rapids, Mich., for the vast 

majority of my life, only moving once before that 
from Brooklyn, N.Y. This first move happened 
just after kindergarten, and by the time first grade 
was over, I had thoroughly exhausted my teachers 
and peers with my fun fact about being from the 
Big Apple. How many five-year-olds can say they 
just came from the cultural center of the Western 
world? At North Park Elementary, I was the only 
one, and took a unique pride in where I was born, 
despite only having lived there for five years — 
eighteen months of which I actually remember. 

This affection for New York stood in stark 

contrast to my feelings towards Grand Rapids. 
Our modest yard, which enthralled my urbanite 
parents, did not live up to the hype (in my five-
year-old opinion). The grass was brown and dry 
from midsummer’s heat and prickled the soles of 
my feet with disdain. In Michigan, there was no 
subway system to whisk our family around, only 
minivans and five-lane roads. The crickets and 
cicadas nonstop symphonies scared my brother 
and me to tears while trying to sleep on our first 
night. The city — or should I call it a town — was 
too small and too far away from the childhood I 
knew and loved. 

This negative first impression of Grand Rapids 

created a pessimistic lens through which I viewed 
the city for the remainder of my time there. It was 
much too hot and humid in the summers, with 90º 
becoming less foreign and more annoying. The 
limited activities within walking distance weren’t 
as much as a problem while my younger brother 
and I required parental supervision, but as we grew 
independent, the entertainment desert that existed 
within our lush, tree-lined streets became painful-
ly obvious. By high school, my friends and I would 
simply drive from strip malls to chain restaurants 

and 
back again, the asphalt roads a conduit to a cure 
for boredom. Exciting events on the weekend 
included hunting the aisles of big box stores for 
Squishmallows or discount holiday candy, a place 
to exist away from our families and school. 

I had always hoped that my parents would 

move somewhere else, swooped to the West coast 
by the winds of a new job, or a lack of inspiration 
from this silly midwest river town. They con-
sistently lamented the conservative politics, the 
name of rich corporate executives plastered on 
every vertical surface and the culture scene that 
was small enough to make their art school sensi-
bilities feel claustrophobic. Somehow, my father’s 
sisters and mother were enough of a glue for us to 
stay put, and my parents have now lived there lon-
ger than they did in the Big City. I graduated high 
school with the determination to not do the same.

And so I ended up in Ann Arbor, barely say-

ing goodbye to my dad when he dropped me off 
at East Quad Residence Hall on that late August 
afternoon. There were things I missed about 
home of course: my cats, my family, my own space. 
Nevertheless, I relished my freedom in a new city. 
Stringing together extended itineraries of campus 
events, bike rides to new parts of the surround-
ing city, trying new dining halls and eateries 
under the changing leaves and crisp skies of fall. 
I avoided home over Fall Break, instead opting for 
a backpacking trip in the Upper Peninsula. By the 
time Thanksgiving recess appeared on my calen-
dar, my parent’s house was foreign. Even though 
it felt good to be home for the holidays, my Grand 
Rapids cabin fever caught up to me by Christmas, 
and Ann Arbor was the place I would have rather 
been.

Similarly, winter semester went by without visit-

ing home once, until University Housing’s infamous 
pandemic email kicked me and my hallmates out of 
the dorms. In an instant, living with my parents in 

Grand 

Rapids went from a rarity to reality. There was a 
sense of premature conclusion when my mom 
and I pulled into the driveway of my childhood 
home, under the drab gray sky of mid-March. 
Though I felt a new sense of ease, this breath 
of release from uptempo university life soon 
became a sleepy trudge through online school. 
My decorated desk at school was now a laptop 
on top of a clothing storage bin. My limbs hurt 
in this crouched position, their only movement 
being between computer tabs. My need for vari-
ety hurt as well. I did homework, interspersed 
class with three half-prepared meals, watched 
TV and went to sleep, all within 20 paces of each 
other. As final exams faded into early summer, I 
woke up in the same bed, ate the same food and 
lived with the same people. The only ounce of 
change I experienced was the season I saw out-
side my window.

I sought to make some change for myself, and 

rode my bike extensively around the city on my 
days off from my return at my high school job. I 
rode along rivers, traced trails and biked through 
the sloping subdivisions and tired traffic lights of 
my hometown. Without the typical hum of mid-
westerners driving the streets, the city spoke for 
itself in a way. I went through neighborhoods I 
knew existed but never got to know, digging into 
the landscape that shaped my youth, stripped 
back from the rhythms of daily life.

By the end of that monotonous stay-at-home 

summer, I was ready to move back to Ann Arbor, 
even if it only was for a new laptop background. 
I felt like I knew Grand Rapids, or at least a ver-
sion of it, inside and out, and a change of scenery 
was necessary. I vowed to never spend that much 
time at my parent’s house again. I quickly accus-
tomed myself to a new routine, immersing myself 
in the new hybrid world of school and work for 
the semester.

Once in a while, I would see class-

mates from high school walking 
through the nearly empty landscape 
of a university online. We would talk, 
trade surface-level feelings and anec-
dotes, before eventually turning to 
Grand Rapids as something we had 
in common. Through these conver-
sations, we shared snapshots of our 
favorite views coming into the city: 
the skyline rising in the distance driv-

ing north on US-131, the lookout from 

the west side bluffs looking over the river. 

These were visual cues of knowing that we 

were home, we were safe and we would soon be in 
the calm of our childhood bedrooms. This came 
as a surprise for me: actively wanting to return to 
my roots. This initial feeling of familiar comfort is 
what I realized I miss most about being home, and 
the thought of upcoming semester breaks tempt-
ed me to relive that experience. 

Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and 

the same proved true about Grand Rapids. 
Though there was less to do than ever dur-
ing my extended pandemic stint at my par-
ent’s house, something about the homogenous 
nature of my time at home made that okay, and 
made me appreciate the calmness of society’s 
relative standstill. I became more comfortable 
with boredom, and more mundane activities 
like going on walks and waving to neighbors 
became highlights of my existence. I once 
despised the place I came from because it was 
so familiar, so last year, so boring. To be sepa-
rated from my former self by geography was 
something I was grateful for. However, being 
away from home has illuminated facets of a 
more reliable daily routine that I now miss, and 
places that I once dismissed as too suburban, 
too normal, glimmer positively in my memory. 

This past summer, in an effort to differenti-

ate from that of 2020, I took jobs that pulled me 
away from Grand Rapids, and I was gone from 
my parent’s home save a couple of weeks in May 
and some days in August. I relished my indepen-
dence and freedom that came with the distance, 
but perhaps I did not give myself enough breath-
ing room, forgetting about the valuable oxygen 
that comes with leisure time at home — the sense 
of refreshment it gives before moving on to a new 
academic year. I underestimated my hometown, 
and upon my eventual return, I hope that I will 
savor the sunsets that reflect off my living room 
window; coloring my childhood street with a 
rose-colored tint, and my memories of it the 
same.
