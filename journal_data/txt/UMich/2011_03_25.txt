STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS
Uncontested
Larkin and
Laverty take
LSA-SG seats

LSA voter turnout
yields 16 percent,
increases from
last semester
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
After staying up late last night
to wait for the results of the LSA
Student Government elections,
LSA juniors Anne Laverty and
Jeff Larkin expressed their ela-
tion and eagerness to get started
in their new executive positions.
In anuncontested race, Laverty
and Larkin received 1575 votes -
1640 including exception ballots
- according to unofficial results
for the LSA-SG spots of president
and vice president, respectively.
Official elections results are
expected to be released today.
In an interview yesterday eve-
ning, Laverty said she is looking
forward to leading the governing
body along with Larkin.
"Jeff and I are really excited
for this opportunity to imple-
ment some of our new ideas and
give attention to ideas that have
beenbroughtup formerlyinother

ernment and really bring them
actively to campus," Laverty said
yesterday evening.
Larkin echoed Laverty's ear-
nest outlook on the potential of
LSA-SG in the upcoming year.
"I can't wait to get to work and
help Anne in whatever kind of
capacity that she needs and what-
ever kind ofcapacity government
needs meas a whole," Larkin said.
In an interview earlier this
week, Laverty and Larkin said
they think hearing students'
opinions and channeling them
into LSA-SG is important for the
government to make changes its
constituents will be content with.
"Right now student govern-
ment is just not very reflective of
the constituents we represent..."
Laverty said at the time. "And I
feel that that needs to be changed,
and in previous administrations
thathasn'tbeen addressed."

"I want everyone to know

know that so many students
have entrusted me with the
responsibilities of president,"
Watson said. "They can expect
great things from this adminis-

According to unofficial elec-
tion results, this year's turnout
was 11 percent. While the turn-
out dropped from last year's 14
percent, Watson said he is happy
with the number.
"I'm at least excited that over
10 percent of the student body
decided to vote in this election,
especially considering that it
wasn't the most contested,"
Watson said.

1000 Voices lobbies LSA

MPowered petition

By JENNIFER LEE

Their aim was to get 1,000
signatures. And as of this morn-
ing, members of the 1000 Voices
project surpassed their goal by
five votes.
Launched by student group

MPowered, the 1000 Voices
project is a petition focusing
on expanding student entre-
preneurship beyond the walls
of the Ross School of Business
and College of Engineering. The
campaign's goal is to get LSA to
offer entrepreneurial classes and
other resources for students to
implement their own innovative
ideas.
Many LSA students have
expressed a desire to have the
option of taking such classes,
said LSA junior Ankit Mehta, the

president of MPowered, a group

and student ventures. He added
the purpose of 1000 Voices isn't
necessarily to incite students to

to engender an entrepreneurial
mindset into LSA classrooms.
"Entrepreneurship is not just
a popular subject, it's also a driv-
ing force of the world," he said.

Michigan man accused of ow.
placing explosive at building $ 4

Suspect has history
of disputes with
the FBI
DETROIT (AP) - A man with a
history of bizarre rants against the
FBI was charged yesterday with
placing an explosive outside a fed-
eral building in Detroit in a case
that has embarrassed the govern-
ment because it was taken inside
by a guard and left unattended for
20 days.
Gary Mikulich was arrested
500 miles away in the Upper
Peninsula and charged with
trying to use an explosive to
damage the McNamara Fed-
eral Building, which houses the
FBI, Internal Revenue Service,

immigration court and other
agencies.
A tool bag holding a metal cash
box was discovered Feb. 26 and
brought inside the building, but it
sat until a Federal Protective Ser-
vice officer decided to X-ray it on
March 18, saw electrical compo-
nents inside and summoned the
Detroit police bomb squad, which
blew it up miles away at a city
park, the FBI said.
"We're all a little shaken,"
said CatherineUGase, 49, who
works for the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration. "I can't
imagine how that could have
happened. I can't imagine why
we weren't evacuated. . . . I was
completely unaware of what was
happeninguntil the all-clear was
announced."

The exploded materials includ-
ed pieces of PVC pipe, a timer and
black electrical tape, along with
a handwritten note that read, "1.
Turn Switch 2. Plug, in," agent
Mark Davidson wrote in an affida-
vit filed in court.
The FBI is not calling it a bomb;
all pieces are still being examined
by experts, spokeswoman Sandra
Berchtold said.
Mikulich, 42, lives in Kingsford
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
He was arrested yesterday and
is due in federal court today in
Marquette, also in the Upper Pen-
insula. An attorney has not been
assigned. A call to his home was
not answered.
In the affidavit, the FBI said
Mikulich has a history of threat-
ening to harm agents.

California maternity center
for Chinese mothers closed

Women claim they
were sent by their
families to give
birth in the U.S.
SAN GABRIEL, Calif. (AP)
- Authorities have closed three
upscale townhouses that were
operating as a maternity center
for Chinese mothers payingthou-
sands of dollars to give birth in
the United States so the children
would automatically gain citizen-
ship.
Police and city inspectors found
seven newborns and two mothers
when they closed the homes for
building code violations on March
8 in San Gabriel, a suburb east of
Los Angeles that is home to a large
Asian population.
The women, who were Chi-
nese and Taiwanese nationals
and spoke little English, told offi-

cials their families had paid to
send them to the United States to
give birth, said city code compli-
ance officer Clayton Anderson.
He did not know how much was
paid.
The women stayed at the cen-
ter before and after giving birth
at local hospitals, Anderson said.
The three homes, part of a
five-unit condo development on
a quiet residential street, had
adjoining inside walls removed
and had rooms divided so moth-
ers each had separate spaces,
Anderson said.
The babies were kept in clear
plastic bassinets in a kitchen con-
verted into a nursery.
"There was a woman there
who said she was a nurse but she
kind of scrambled away when we
got there," Anderson said.
The women and babies were
taken to another location after
the homes were deemed unsafe
for occupancy because structural
*

walls had been breached.
U.S. law automatically entitles
children born on U.S. soil to citi-
zenship, and it is not illegal for
pregnant women to visit the U.S.
to give birth.
Women from other countries
have long traveled to the U.S.
legally on tourist or student visas
and given birth, but this case
is unusual in that it appears to
involve an organized business,
experts said.
"The reports up to now have
been about travel agencies
abroad that specialized in this,
but they send one person at a
time here," said Mark Krikorian,
executive director of the Wash-
ington, D.C.-based Center for
Immigration Studies. "What this
could suggest is ... they're taking
it to the next step. Whoever is
organizing this type of operation
is buying or leasing a home to
become a clearing house. That's
a serious problem."

Jordan's opposition also want

elections to be held under a new

of votes in districts inhabited by
tribesmen, who form the bedrock
of support for the king.

"My degree went to waste,"
he said. "Still, I can barely make

LSA-SG
From Page 1
Of the approximately 15,000
students who were able to vote
in the election, 2,521 cast ballots
- a turnout of about 16 percent
- which is an increase from the
2,290 votes cast in the fall 2010
elections, according to unofficial
results.
While Larkin and Laverty
earned the majority of votes, The
Every Three Weekly's fictional
candidate Karlos Marks - also
spelled Marx - came in second
place with 103 write-in votes.
Larkin and Laverty said they
plan to form an alliance between
students and their governing
body through measures like add-
ing a forum to the LSA-SG web-
site to obtain student feedback.
Lavertysaid lastnightthat she
and Larkin will establish con-
crete ways to facilitate dialogue
between LSA-SG and student
groups.
"(Jeff and I are) goingto actu-
ally outline how we're going to
attack these problems, make
them more tangible goals,"
Laverty said. "I think we need to
set deadlines for ourselves and
for the executive board that is
selected so that... representatives
are held accountable."
Laverty and Larkin said they
also hope to amend the LSA-SG
bylaws to make each representa-
tive responsible for a fixed group
of LSA students.
"Student government is a
group that should be positively
affecting students, should know
what students want and should
work toward those goals," Lar-
kin said in an interview earlier
this week. "And I think we've
made great strides toward that
in the past year, and I want to
make it even better."
Amid the excitement of the
election, Laverty acknowledged
that the road ahead wouldn't be
entirely unchallenging or prob-
lem free.
"I think some of these are

actually going to be great risks.
We are making change to the
way our government works
and . functions," Laverty said.
"I think we have to also under-
stand that we might not get it
right the first time, but that
we're going to be learning as
this goes."
Despite this learning curve,
Laverty said she feels she and
Larkin will be able to improve
the lives of students on campus.
"I think it's going to be a great
year and a great opportunity to
really revive some of the focuses
of student government that have
been excluded in years past,"
Laverty said.
Fourteen candidates also ran
in the election to fill the nine
representative seats on LSA-
SG. While there were some new
faces in the race, there were also
five representatives running
for re-election, including LSA
senior Carly Goldberg, the cur-
rent LSA-SG vice president.
The new LSA-SG represen-
tatives include Carly Goldberg,
Ally Sherman, Arielle Zupmore,
Brandon Byrd and Melissa
Burns - who won re-election
- in addition to Justin Wag-
ner, Mitchell LaPoff and Megan
Pfeiffer.
The LSA-SG student body
election also included three bal-
lot questions, which considered
various issues related to campus
life and the impact of LSA-SG at
the University.

asked students whether they
would support an increase in
the student fee that is allocated
to LSA-SG, was passed. Accord-
ing to the online ballot, the cur-
rent $1.50 fee has been fixed
since 1998, and LSA-SG propos-
es raising the fee to $2.50 each
semester, ultimately generating
$14,000 more for student-run
organizations - including stu-
dent governments within each
college - at the University.
Ballot question two asked if
students want to take an intro-
ductory journalism class and

question three asked students
to rank what they thought the
LSA student government's top
priorities should be. According
to unofficial election results,
question two did not pass with
1,293 students voting against the
proposal and 990 for it. Students
ranked "providing more money
to studentgroups" and "increas-
ing sustainability efforts on
campus" as their top priorities
in question three.
RACKHAM VOTER
TURNOUT DECREASES
While the voter turnout of
Rackham Student Government
elections was lower than past
elections with 361 total votes
cast - a 4.63 percent turnout -
according to unofficial results,
many new additions were made
to RSG when the polls closed at
11:59 p.m. last night.
Last semester's RSG elections
had a 7.03 percent voter turnout
- a jump from the previous two
semesters.
In an uncontested race, cur-
rent RSG President Michael
Benson and Joshua Bow - cur-
rent Division III representative
and RSG academic affairs com-
mittee co-chair - will fill the
presidential and vice presiden-
tial seats, respectively, on the
first day of springterm.
Eleven candidates were also
elected to the open represen-
tative seats between the four
divisions of RSG: Biological and
Health Sciences, Physical Sci-
ences and Engineering, Social
Sciences and Education and
Arts and Humanities.
The Biological and Health
Sciences seats were filled by
Kaitlin Flynn and Serge Fari-
nas, Physical Sciences and Engi-
neering by Nina White, Anagha
Kshirsagar, Patrick Rooney and
Heidi Pedini, Social Sciences
and Education by Rob Gillezeau,
Anne Fitzpatrick and Marisol
Ramos, and Arts and Humani-
ties by William Hutchinson and
Grant Mandarino.

Breaha Patterson wrote in an
e-mail interview early this
morning that more numbers for
the election would be available
today. Like Watson, she wrote
that she is satisfied with the
voter turnout.
"I would have liked to see a
higher turnout of course, we
think the elections are impor-
tant and strive to get as many
students as possible," Patterson
wrote.
For this semester's election,
the student governments also
brought back polling stations
- which had not been used in
10 years - in addition to online,
voting with the hopes of getting
more students to vote.
"I definitely think the par-
ties did a good job with visibility
and with the addition of poll-
ing stations, it at least put into
people's minds that there was
an election," Patterson wrote.
"... I think it actually gave voters
a chance to ask questions that
they might not have gotten the
opportunity to otherwise."
Hatcher, whose campaign
was centered on bringing the
campus community together
and making it more diverse,
said while she was disappointed
with the election's outcome, she
is looking forward to continu-
ing her work with DAAP and
is optimistic about next year's
elections.
"I'm a little bit disappointed,
but I guess that just comes along
with it," Hatcher said. "I really
hope that a lot of things that
(Watson and Campbell) said in

their platform, I really hope that
they get them done because they
really do have some nice points."
Out of 39 total representative
seats on MSA, MForward won 28
spots.
In opposition to the MSA par-
ties, the student-run satire maga-
zine on campus The Every Three
Weekly endorsed a campaign
students to write in a fictitious
presidential candidate, Karlos
Marks.
"The Every Three Weekly
supported Marks's campaign
because we were tired of the
usual uninspiring MSA can-
didates ..." The Every Three
Weekly editorial staff wrote in
an e-mail interview prior to the
election.
According to unofficial elec-
tion results, 55 percent of stu-
dents who cast their ballots
voted yes on a poll question on
the MSA ballot inquiring wheth-
er students would want to pay
a maximum of $4 per term to
have free copies of The New York
Times on campus. MSA planned
on using the ballot question to
assess student sentiment on The
New York Times College Reader-
ship Program, which had a trial
run on campus last week.
Also elected in the student
government elections is LSA
junior Ellen Steele, who won the
student position on the Universi-
ty's Department of Public Safety
Oversight Committee, an advi-
sory board that hears grievances
against the campus police. Steele
ran uncontested.
The second student seat onthe
committee will become open in
May. MSA plans to fill the posi-
tion with a write-in candidate
from thisweek's election.

cational programs for people
with disabilities. The event was
organized by LSA freshman
Paul Willar, the Pi Kappa Phi
philanthropy chair.
Willar, whose mother has
worked at the Cornerstone-Wol-
cott Center for 10 years, wrote
in an e-mail interview that he
wanted the dinner to help his
fraternity brothers understand
what it's like to live with a dis-
ability.
"This dinner is an opportuni-
ty for the brothers of our house
to not only experience what it
may be like to have a disability,

but realize how fortunate we
are for what we do have," Willar
wrote.
LSA senior and Pi Kappa Phi
member Sal Amodeo said the
dinner was also representative
of the fraternity's interests.
"When we're selling our fra-
ternity, we're advocating that
we're more than a social club,"
Amodeo said. "We do more
important things than party."
Willar wrote that about half
the Pi Kappa Phi brothers volun-
teer at the Eisenhower Center -
a local organization that works
with brain trauma patients - a
few times a month. He added
that he would like to see at least
75 percent of the fraternity
members volunteer.

"We pride ourselves in
being the only fraternity with a
national philanthropy associa-
tion," LSA senior and Pi Kappa
Phi member Saahil Karpe said,
referring to the non-profit orga-
nization Push America, which
also focuses on awareness and
philanthropy for people with
disabilities.
The center helped 2,472 peo-
ple with disabilities from Washt-
enaw, Livingston and Monroe
counties last year, according to
a pamphlet from the Ann Arbor
Center for Independent Living.
Sue Probert, a commu-
nity resource specialist at the
AACIL, said she was grateful
for Pi Kappa Phi's donation, and
that it will benefit the center.

Woman killed
after a brick wall
collapsed
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -
A powerful earthquake struck
northeastern Myanmar last
night, killing one woman and
shaking buildings as far away as
Bangkok. No tsunami was gen-
erated.
Homes and at least one bridge
were damaged in several vil-
lages along Myanmar's borders
with Thailand and Laos, accord-
ing to residents who spoke to an
aid agency.
There were also reports of
minor damage in northern Thai-
land, where a woman died when
a brick wall collapsed on her,
police Capt. Weerapon Samran-
jai said. Cracks spread in the

foundations of some buildings
in the province surrounding
the city of Chiang Rai, about 55
miles (90 kilometers) from the
epicenter. The spires fell off two
pagodas.
"The tremor was so strong,
and things fell down from the
shelves. It was very scary, and
we all ran out to the streets,"
said a 25-year old woman who
runs a mini-mart in Tachileik, a
Myanmar town near the border.
As is common in the country,
she spoke on condition of ano-
nymity because authorities dis-
courage talking to the media.
It was difficult to get a com-
prehensive picture of damage in
the country's remote northeast,
where communications, even
at the best of time, are sketchy.
The military-run government
also tightly controls informa-
tion.

Save Hollywood North
Snyder shouldn't cut Michigan film tax credits
Part of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's recently proposed bud-
get cuts includes the termination of the popular Michigan
film incentive. According to Snyder, this cut was just one of
the many tax incentives that were slashed in order to "level the play-
ing field." That creed may be applicable to other industries within the
crippled Michigan economy, but to the film industry, this cut won't
level the playing field as much as it will potentially eliminate it.

A Black' Friday

Implemented in April 2008, the Michigan
film tax incentive has not only boosted the
state's economy, but it has also singlehandedly
brought a new industry to Michigan. The cred-
its gave a substantial amount of tax incentives
to those in the movie industry interested in
filming in Michigan. This taxbreak - the larg-
est of its kind in the United States - covered up
to 42 percent of the production costs involved
with the filming of a movie. In its three-year
existence, the plan has resulted in more than
135 productions and has cost the state approxi-
mately $304 million, only $96 million of which
has been paid out, according to a Feb. 17 Free
Press article. This, compared to the more than
$649 million in revenue that the tax break has
generated, is more than enough reason to ques-
tion its recent termination.
The recent slash of the film tax incentive
will inevitably devastate the currently boom-
ing Michigan film industry. At a time when
most industries in the state are failing, the
film industry has become what some have
begun to call "Hollywood North." In its brief
existence, this blossoming industry has cre-
ated more than 6,763 film production-related
jobs, along with more than 4,000 jobs for
extras, according to the Free Press. While
abandoned industrial buildings continue to
plague the state, a former Pontiac car plant

is being filled with the new, state-of-the-art
$80 million Raleigh Michigan Studios, which
plans to open this spring. This massive infra-
structural improvement, along with two
other smaller studios already in operation, is
aidingthe Michigan economy.
The state must also recognize the restau-
rants, hotels and countless local businesses
that have undoubtedly benefited from the tax
incentives. The movie sets give an incredible
economic and morale boost to cities, as wit-
nessed in Ann Arbor during last week's film-
ing of George Clooney's coming movie, "Ides
of March." This recent production briefly
employed many of our peers and inevitably
helped the local Ann Arbor community.
If Snyder wishes to implement much-
needed budget cuts, he must do it in a reason-
able fashion. Instead of examining the many
Michigan tax incentives in a fine-tuned and
reasonable manner, Snyder decided to blithely
eliminate many of the tax incentives offered
by the state. In some ways, these budget cuts
are much needed, but the film tax incentive
should be an exception. As President Barack
Obama has repeatedly stated, we must make
budget cuts "with a scalpel, not a machete."
The elimination of the Michigan film tax
incentive fully exemplifies what the president
is trying to prevent.

Someone call Don McLean -
we'll be singing bye-bye to
Miss American Pie very soon.
It's said that McLean was talking
about the day
Buddy Holly
passed when he
wrote his 1971
song "American
Pie." I say that's
possible, but I -
prefer to think
that McLean was ERIC
actually a time SZKARLAT
traveler. After a
trip to 2011, he
came back and
sat down to write about the day the
music died - or, rather, the day that
Rebecca Black wrote the song "Fri-
day."
The video was featured on Com-
edy Central's "Tosh.O," where its
notoriety began. It then went viral,
exploding all over the world and
being watched by people who merely
wished to ridicule it. Black's lyrics,
melody, voice and awkward dancing
seeped into our brains and got stuck
in our heads. To Black, the catchi-
ness of the tune, and those who can't
get it out of their heads, represents
a sort of poetic justice - those peo-
ple who've made fun of her deserve
to have the most hated song in the
world stuck in their head. To listen-
ers, it's motivation for a homicidal
rampage. (But don't expect that to
hold up in court.)
Maybe Black should've taken a
note out of Ke$ha's book. Ke$ha
is one of the most well known art-
ists on the scene right now. Black
could really benefit from following
Ke$ha's example of ridiculous lyrics
- many of which concern partying
- boring melodies, annoying voice
and heavy reliance on Auto-tune

software. Ke$ha is a popular record-
ing artist and Rebecca Black is a
nothing. All she needs to do is take
advantage of all the things Ke$ha's
taken advantage of.
Alright - quiz time. Have you
studied? I'll give you the refrain
from a popular song. You have to tell
me: What is the most hated song of
the following?
A) LMFAO - "Shots"
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
- EVERYBODY! (repeat)
B) DJ Khaled - "All I Do is Win"
Everybody hands go up - and
they stay there, and they say yeah,
and they stay there, up, down, up
down. Cause all I do iswin, win, win,
and if you goin' in, put your hands in
the air!
C) Rebecca Black - "Friday"
It's Friday, Friday, gotta get down
on Friday. Everybody's looking for-
ward to the weekend, weekend. Fri-
day, Friday, getting down on Friday.
Everybody's looking forward to the
weekend.
D) Ke-dollar sign-ha - "Tik Tok"
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ blow
my speakers up tonight, I'ma fight,
'til we see the sunlight. Tick, tock on
the clock, but the party don't stop.
(guttural sounds)
E) Rihanna - "Umbrella"
You can stand under my umbrella.
You can stand under my umbrella,
ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
The correct answer, if you hadn't
guessed, is C. Did you pass? Good for
you. You get an extra point added to
your GPA. I'll let president Mary Sue
Coleman know. Power of the press,
and all that.
What really sets Black's "Friday"
apart from the other examples is
her annoying voice. Wait - Ke$ha

whines her way through "Tik Tok."
But Black's lyrics are more bor-
ing than the rest. Wait - LMFAO's
"Shots" aren't exactly a pinnacle of
lyricism. But her melody - wait.
Almost every song on the list fea-
tures passages where the vocal line
rests continuously on one note. But
her reliance on Auto-tune - never
mind.
Popular music
has reached a
new low.
Well, now we've got a problem.
What really makes Black unique?
Why is she most hated? Ok, she
spends the bridge of the song list-
ing the days of the week. Yeah,
that's it. She says, "Monday, Tues-
day, Wednesday and Thursday, Fri-
day, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday."
Yeah, that's it. She is stupid because
she sang that. Or was that the Black
Eyed Peas? I can't keep them straight
these days.
Now it's starting to look to me as
if Black is merely following the tra-
dition of those brilliant artists who
have preceded her. She's not the
outlier. She's the culmination of all
the music that has immediately pre-
ceded her. She was merely raised on
the music of the party. She is where
the music industry is presently. We
shouldn'thate her. We should glorify
her achievements.
Popular music, thy name is
Rebecca Black.

A 'foolish' bill

The Most Ridiculously Unconstitutional
Attempt award for March was won by the New
Hampshire Republican Party for its attempt
to ban college students from elections. The
state's Speaker of the House, William O'Brien,
also takes the title of Most in Need of a Men-
tal Filter with his astonishing comment that
students are "foolish" and "vote their feel-
ings" because they are "liberal," which was of
course caught on tape and widely circulated
on YouTube. His general position is that stu-
dents in New Hampshire flood the polls and
skew the results with their "plethora of the
easy self-confidence that only ignorance and
inexperience can produce." He would rather
that college students vote according to their
parents' residency status.
College students aren't desirable voters,
despite all attempts to mobilize them. Even in
our liberal Ann Arbor, elections are timed to
exclude college voters. While ostensibly mov-
ing the election to October so students could
vote, the city moved the primaries to the sum-
mer - and in a one-party city, that's all that
matters. Now, I'm still registeredtovote where
I graduated high school, but to me this seems
a little screwed up. If it weren't for these big
universities with thousands of students, cities
like Ann Arbor would be nothing but a blip on
the radar. But apparently politicians don't see
it that way, and they care more about pushing
their interests through than factoring in the
thousands of students who live there Septem-
ber through May.
Thankfully, O'Brien's bill has been killed,
but New Hampshire's GOP leadership omi-
nously promises that the issue will continue to
be a priority. There are so many things wrong
with this it's impossible to know where to
start. For one, students generally live in their
college town for at least eight months outof the
year, which is plenty long enough for them to
be more concerned about what happens there
than in their hometowns. And calling some of

the best-educated people in the county "fool-
ish" demonstrates something about O'Brien's
IQ. Yes, students are inexperienced, but so
are housewives who have never left their own
town - and we still let themvote. Just because
you don't like how a personvotes doesn't mean
you can take awaytheir vote. Maybe instead of
attacking students, the GOP should try actual-
ly listening to the concerns of students and, oh
I don't know, try to attract that demographic.
Yes, O'Brien gives reasons that he suppos-
edly believes to be true as grounds for barring
college students from voting. But truthfully,
it's just a poorly veiled attempt to eliminate the
votes of a demographic that doesn't tradition-
ally support the GOP. For that matter, maybe
he should advocate for repealing women's suf-
frage because women also tend to support the
Democrats. Somehow I don't think that one
would make it through the legislature.
But for me, perhaps the most ridiculous part
of this cluster of a bill is that college students
don't vote enough for this to be a real problem.
They're constantly the least mobilized, least
active age group in the nation. In the 2010
midterm election, only 19 percent of the under
age 30 demographic turned out to vote in
New Hampshire, according to CIRCLE. Col-
lege voters are hardly tipping the scale. If any
group is a threat, it's the retired set. But wait,
retirees usually vote conservative.
This plan seems to be nothingbut a targeted
attempt to exclude supporters of another party
from voting in elections. And the last time I
checked, that's illegal and seriously frowned
upon. We live in a democracy where, for bet-
ter or worse, all citizens get to vote. If O'Brien
doesn't like that then maybe he shouldn't be
allowed to make laws. I, for one, hope that in
the next election New Hampshire students
turn out en masse to "foolishly" elect anyone
who isn't a Republican.

On March 17 every year, Irish heritage becomes a point
of pride for people across the United States and beyond.
Particularly inthe U.S., where almost everyone has immi-
grant ancestry, there's a certain dignity gained through
the ability to identify percentages or surnames of rela-
tives that indicate Irish ancestry. Having lived in Ireland
briefly as a child, and having a mother who emigrated
from there, have earned me social points for as long as
I've been in school in the U.S. Since kindergarten, people
have been excited to hear of my experiences and to share
their relevant family background. The care that people
take to preserve their Irishness seems almost inversely
proportional to other immigrant groups (at least in their
public images), who are often strongly encouraged .to
assimilate. Does this seem at all hypocritical?
An article by Gregory Rodriguez, published in The
Los Angeles Times in 2007, titled "Illegal? Better if
you're Irish," details the relative luxury enjoyed by
contemporary Irish illegal immigrants compared with
those of other nationalities. He explains that "Irish ille-
gals do have a slight advantage. It's all in the stereotypes
- race-based, language-based, class-based." This hasn't
always been the case, however. In 19th century Detroit,
some shops had signs stating "No Irish Need Apply," but
there were fewer signs here than in the eastern states.
In those days, the T-shirt slogans so common nowadays,
"Proud Irish," "Irish Princess" and "I'm so Irish I Bleed
Whiskey," to name a few, would have been absurd. Com-
paratively, while it's possible to find "Everyone Loves a
Latina Girl" T-shirts online, the concept isn't nearly as
common as to become cliche, like Irish-American pride
has become.
The fact that Irish heritage is respected so much in
this country means that it's relatively inoffensive to
equate Irish culture with stereotypes that would other-
wise have negative connotations - they're often thought
of as traditional and superstitious, easily agitated, and
above all, drunk. If they didn't enjoy such high social
status in our culture, then joking about negative conno-
tations associated with the Irish wouldn't be acceptable;
if there were a "drunk Arab" stereotype, joking about it
would still be unacceptable (or would at least be enor-
mously disrespectful). Maybe part of the reason that it's
acceptable to joke about the Irish has to do with their

longstanding establishment here in the U.S.
Historic discrimination may be a source of respect
now. People are proud of the fact that they come from
a long line of people who have worked to get their fam-
ily where it is now. The "my family has worked hard
for generations to get me where I am today" line gets
used to excuse people from empathizing with mod-
ern immigrants, whose ancestors may not have con-
tributed directly to the development of this country
- though with modern globalized political and econom-
ic networks, people's actions affect foreign nations more
directly than before. However, ancestral labor shouldn't
be used to create a cultural hierarchy; if so, then we
would become like the societies of old, with aristocra-
cies based on history, rather than wealth based on labor
and innovation.
Many of the Irish immigrants came here before social
security and food stamps and Medicaid and before
labor standards prevented them from being used as
cheap labor. The U.S. needed people to build railroads;
the Irish needed jobs. Is it modern labor standards that
have changed our attitudes toward immigrants (or
rather, caused the difference between our retrospec-
tive opinions of our ancestry and our current stance on
immigrants today)? Though immigrants are still often
exploited for their willingness to work for low wages,
the practice isn't as socially and legally accepted as it
was in the days of the Irish potato famine. Furthermore,
once immigrants acquire a Green Card, they're eligible
for social security, financial aid for higher education and
other benefits.
Though there are differences between current immi-
gration to the U.S. - and the Irish immigration trends
of the late 19th and early 20th centuries - we shouldn't
forget their similarities. Both groups have been viewed
as second-class citizens. Both are pursuing some sort of

entrepreneurship for students
to gain credit toward their con-
centration through work outside
class.
As of 1 a.m. this morning,
the online petition, which was
launched earlier this.month, had
recorded 1,005 "voices heard."
The organization will discuss
the specifics of the integration
of entrepreneurial-based classes
into the college with the Univer-
sity administration after the peti-
tion gains 1,000 signatures.
"1000 Voices is more than
just a petition, it's a movement,"
Mehta said. "This is a once in a
lifetime opportunity. In the 194'
years of our University's history,
no opportunity like this has ever
come out."
LSA junior Max Levenstein,

easy, but for a single neuron cell, it's
extraordinary. That makes us think
that there must be some third party.
It's a really complex event that
appears to happen sort of beyond
what you'd expect an individual cell
to know."
Murphy said what they discov-
ered during their research wasn't
initially the main focus of the study.
"This was sort of a side project
from those experiments," Murphy
said. "We were interested in know-
ing how those newborn neurons
contribute to the cellular phenom-
ena that we think involves acquiring
memories."
The study investigated the role
of newborn neurons and synaptic
plasticity in the brain, he said.

who signed the petition, said
having opportunities outside the
classroom with hands-on entre-
preneurial work would be benefi-
cial to students.
Levenstein said he hoped that
programs like the Undergraduate
Research Opportunity Program
could be developed for entrepre-
neurship.
"You (would) have a class that
you're taking creditfor but you do
a lot of work in the community,"
Levenstein said.
Mehta stressed the desire for
an entrepreneurial curriculum
within LSA. He cited the MPow-
ered program eRes - a living and
learning community on campus
centered on entrepreneurship
and leadership that is in its pilot
year - as an example of a grow-
ing need for an initiative like 1000
Voices.
"The fact that (eRes) tripled
(in) size shows that there are
"Synaptic plasticity is a broad
term used to indicate how changes
occur in the brain - and specifically
to this study - how neurons change
and interact in the brain," Murphy
said.
Jack Parent, director of the Uni-
versity's Neurodevelopment and
Regeneration Laboratory and an
associate professor of neurology,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
new nerve cells are born in adult
brains and "are thought to play
a specific role in certain types of
learning and memory."
Murphy explained that new neu-
rons constantly replenish them-
selves in the hippocampus region
of the brain - a crucial part of the
brain associated with short- and
long-term memory.
"One of the reasons that this
region is so important is because it
is required for acquiring memories,"

unmet programming needs in the
University of Michigan," Mehta
said.
Mehta said the success of
MPowered's other initiative, 1000
Pitches - an annual competition
in which students present origi-
nal ideas they wish to be used at
the University or elsewhere- has
also demonstrated that there is a
substantial fraction of the student
body with entrepreneurial inter-
est.
"This year we got 3,000 pitch-
es," Mehta said. "1000 Voices is
just about unifying what people
want about their entrepreneurial
education."
For LSA senior Caroline
Rooney, 1000 Voices has struck a
personal chord. During the win-
ter of her freshman year, Rooney
launched The Baron, a clothing
company that donates 10 percent
of its revenue to a variety of non-
profit organizations.
Murphy said. "And specifically we
call them declarative memories -
these are memories for people, plac-
es, events.".
Genetically modified mice were
used to conduct the study, Murphy
said. The mice were given a toxic
compound that prevented new neu-
rons from developing so the scien-
tists could examine their synaptic
plasticity. The team then removed
the brains from the mice to examine
how their synaptic plasticity was
affected, according to Murphy.
"We wanted to see what would
happen if we permanently sup-
pressed neurons," he said. "We
expected the synaptic plasticity to
go away forever."
But the results came as a sur-
prise, Murphy said.
"What we found was that the
synaptic plasticity actually comes
back, in the absence of neurons," he

She described the formation of
her startup business as a difficult
but rewarding experience that
taught her how to make an idea
come to life.
"The things you learn from
entrepreneurship can be applied
across the board," Rooney said.
"Everyone needs to know how to
think outside the box and believe
in themselves, as cheesy as that
might sound. It's a huge vote of
confidence learning about how
you can follow your own ideas
and make them into reality."
Rooney said there is a lack of
diversity - in terms of the gen-
der of participants and the type
of startups - within the entre-
preneurial community, a concern
that compelled her to sign the
1000 Voices petition.
"For me specifically, I've been
very vocal over the last year or so
about getting more women and
more LSA students involved, and
said. "The network sort of rearrang-
es itself to accommodate the loss of
those newborn neurons."
However, Murphy said he was
still unsure why the synaptic plas-
ticity returned to the mice.
"If you turn off the birthing of
neurons, the ones that are born
right before that are more likely to
survive," he said. "We don't really
understand how that happens."
Parent described how new nerve
cells play a roll in learning and
memory.
"Our new findings suggest that
the new nerve cells born in the
adultbrain likely play a very impor-
tant role in learning and memory, a
role so important that when we get
rid of the adult-born nerve cells,
the mature cells can be recruited
to act like immature nerve cells,"
Parent wrote. "It is kind of like
teaching an old dog new tricks -

I think this specifically struck
me because of my interest there,"
Rooney said.
She said many students are
creating startups in the biomedi-
cal and technological fields, but
there is a need for University sup-
port for entrepreneurial ventures
in other areas..
"There are not as many
resources for entrepreneurs who
are interested in retail startups,
art startups, in psychology -
things that represent more of a
multidisciplinary aspect of entre-
preneurship," Rooney said.
One of the challenges for LSA
students that Rooney cited is the
lack of easy access to resources
available on North Campus like
the College of Engineering's
Center for Entrepreneurship, for
example.
"Students on Central Campus
aren't inclined to go up to North
Campus," Rooney said.
the mature nerve cells become less
"inhibited" and more plastic (or
malleable) when we get rid of the
young cells."
The study is different than other
studies conducted on this topic
because it considers long-term
responses of thebrain, Murphy said.
If scientists are able to pinpoint
the signals that govern the relation-
ship between newborn neurons and
synaptic plasticity, they may be able
to do something if the brain is dam-
aged or aging, Murphy said.
Parent wrote the discoveries
from the study will lead to major
changes in the field of neurodevel-
opment and regeneration, including
some changes in his own lab.
"Much of my laboratory now
focuses on generating stem cells
by reprogramming mature cells,
such as skin cells, and making the
stem cells into nerve or heart cells,"

Despite being a student in LSA,
Levenstein said he hasn't been
deterred from entrepreneurship.
"It seems like entrepreneur-
ship is probably geared towards
the engineering school mainly
because it's obvious that engi-
neers make things, they create
products," Levenstein said. "But I
think LSA students have just the
exact same incentives and ability
to create things, but LSA didn't
think that far. We have all these
theories that we learn, but there's
no component to create change."
Levenstein said his motivation
to sign the 1000 Voices petition
stemmed from his desire to have
more practical problem-solving
courses in LSA.
"We definitely acknowledge
that we need to correct these
problems, but there's never an
additional aspect to our educa-
tion that addresses the issue of
actually solving them," he said.
Parent wrote. "We are taking skin
cells from patients with specific
disorders to study how the diseases
are caused and identify new treat-
ments."
Stephen Maren, director of the
University's Neuroscience Graduate
Program, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that the study provides poten-
tial insight into the brain's ability to
overcome disruptions.
"The work is quite exciting
because it reveals that the brain can
compensate for a variety of insults
- in this case, a genetic manipula-
tion that prevents new cells from
being born in the hippocampus,"
Maren wrote. "It suggests that
there are molecular mechanisms
involved in re-establishing normal
brain function after it is perturbed.
Understanding these mechanisms
may inform new clinical interven-
tions forbrain insults."

Buying fame at the Ark factory

Rebecca Black's
label floods us with
fledgling artists
By ARIELLE SPECINER
DailyArts Writer
They say those who can't do,
teach (and those who can't teach,
teach gym). So what about those
who don't make it on the Disney
Channel? They sign with Ark
Music Factory.
Ark Music Factory has been
the buzz around cyberspace since
13-year-old Rebecca Black became
a trending topic on Twitter and
serenaded us via YouTube with
our favorite days-of-the-week
song, "Friday" (you know, today is
Friday, tomorrow is Saturday and
Sunday comes afterwards - that
song). But what really constitutes
this house of fake Mouseketeers
that we keep hearing about?
Ark Music Factory is a record
label to which young teens and
pre-teens sign in order to make
ridiculous songs with equally

ridiculous music videos only so
they can become "viral stars."
At the moment, eight artists are
exclusively signed to the label,
ranging from the Auto-Tuned
pipsqueak Madison Bray (who
sounds like she's 21 when in real-
ity she's 11) to the much more
mature Ishraq, whose profile
photos on Ark's website are more
sex than sing.
Ark calls itself an "indie record
label," but the "stars" it produces
are not what most would call
indie. I mean sure, technically
they are "independent" - being
new and undiscovered - but what
this factory really pumps out are
pure Bieber-esque pop wannabes
with over-indulgentstage mothers
and a sad life ahead of them. I'm
not saying that these kids aren't
talented - they probably are -
but they just seem like the Mickey
Mouse rejects who weren't whole-
some or perky enough to be the
next Hannah Montana.
The main difference about this
record label is that the company
doesn't pay the artists - the art-
ists pay the company. Rebecca

Black's mother paid $2,000 for
a package that consisted of pre-
written songs for her daughter to
sing. Talk about selling out. This
is an absurd and unrighteous way
to showcase talent. Sure, there's
no such thing as a free lunch (or
in this case, a music career), but
seriously - who would ever think
we'd live in a society where peo-
ple pay for their stardom? I know
some celebrities are low enough to
stage their own paparazzi shots,
but to pay for a terrible song just so
they can become a YouTube star -
that's crazy. Maybe, I'm just naive,
but is the 15 minutes of fame really
worth it?
Take for instance our new viral
friend Rebecca Black. She claims
she wants to be as popular as the
beloved Justin Bieber. To start, she
does not have the hair. Secondly,
the companyis doingit backwards.
Usually, as in Bieb's case, he put
himself out there and then signed
a record label contract. He was
an unknown who generated a lot
of views and popularity from the
videos he put up, which then got
the record exec's attentions (yeah,

YORK TIMES
AIN'T GOT

ON US.

COURTESY OF NEW YORK MAGAZINE
Rebecca Black has ... been made fun of enough.

I saw "Never Say Never" - judge
me, it was awesome). What this
company is doing is signing these
hopefuls with the promise of mak-
ing them YouTube stars. You can't
push popularity like that - that's
what makes people push back.
That is why Rebecca Black has
generated so much hatred. It's not
that her songsucks - alot of songs
suck - it's that this company is
trying to force YouTube stardom.
Ark Music Factory is a revolu-

tionary type of record label. It's
not looking for the next Grammy
winner or chart-topper, it's look-
ing for the next artist who can
gain a million views on YouTube
in 24 hours. The rise of this type
of record company truly shows
that times are changing. People
don't even want to be pop stars
anymore, they want to be You-
Tube stars. Oh, and we already
knew that Sunday comes after
Saturday - thanks.

Spellboundby MUSKET
University musical theater group kids around
in 'Putnam County Spelling Bee'
By Cassie Balfour ( Daily Arts Writer

"My unfortunate erection /
Is destroying my perfection,"
cries Chip Tolentino, played by
LSA fresh-
man Dave
Caldwell, The25th Annual
after his Putnam County
dream of Spelling Bee
becoming
Putnam Today and
County's tomorrow at 8 p.m.,
preemi- Sundayat2 p.m.
nent speller
is foiled Power enter
by adoles- From $
cence. It
happens to the best of us. Luck-
ily, the University will be able to
relive those traumatizing middle
school years this weekend at the
Power Center.
MUSKET will be performing
"The 25th Annual Putnam Coun-
ty Spelling Bee," a one-act show
about six quirky child prodigies
competing in a high-stakes spell-
ing bee while attempting to navi-
gate the single most harrowing
experience known to mankind:
puberty.
"These roughly nine to 13 year
olds are taking part in the Put-
nam spelling bee," director and
Music, Theatre and Dance senior
Rebecca Spooner said. "It's these
six eclectic and eccentric kids,
each have their own little quirks
and stories and backgrounds.
They're the misfits, they're the
outcasts, they're the oddballs and
the scapegoats, but they're all very
lovable."
The beloved comedy features a
kooky cast of characters brought
together by their insatiable need
to win the county spelling bee.
The Broadway musical has roots
connecting it back to the Universi-
ty, which is just one of the reasons
MUSKET picked the musical.
"The original Broadway show
has a couple of Michigan alums in
it and so we were excited to bring

it back to the University," pro-
ducer and MT&D junior Kathryn
Pamula said.
"Spelling Bee" has a small cast
of just nine members, with many
of the actors doubling up on roles.
The fast-paced show, which fea-
tures plenty of improv with char-
acters spontaneously ad-libbing
quick one-liners, is more light-
hearted than past MUSKET fare.
"This, is the first show that
MUSKET has done since I've got
here that no one dies," Pamula
said. "They've been fun at times
but someone always dies. So doing
a happy show with a small cast has
given the experience of a sense of
family and sense of community."
The characters in the show
range from brilliant child genius-
es like William Barfde, who spells
out words by outlining the let-
ters with his "magic foot," to the
zany Leaf Coneybear, who has to
go into a trance before spelling
out his word. Even though the
characters let their freak flags fly,
they're easily relatable for Uni-
versity students who undoubt-
edly cringe when confronted with
frizzy-haired "photo memories"
on Facebook.
"The characters are all strug-
gling with growing up," Caldwell
said. "My character is trying to
maintain this perfect child star
image. He gets very caught up in
his genitals, which are changing
and becoming erect all the time."
Caldwell added that getting
into character required him to
remember what it was like being
at that awkward age.
"I'm really focusing on being
true to what a child-slash-tween
goes through," he said.
"SpellingBee" maybe peppered
with raunchy and crowd-pleasing
musical numbers, but cast mem-
bers and crew seem to agree that
the focal point of the show is the
characters themselves.

cHRIS DZOMBAK/Daily
The "Spelling Bee" competitors include audience members.

"The jokes are great, but it's
really about the characters, and
as the director I've really had
the opportunity to dig into these
characters," Spooner said.
MT&D and LSA junior Ali Gor-
don, who plays the shy, diction-
ary-loving Olive Ostrovsky, knows
students will see themselves in
the show.
"The musical has a surprising
amount of heart. It's a show about
growing up; it's about kids real-
izing that they're on the verge of
adulthood," she said.
Every aspect of the contestants'
personalities has been considered
and toyed with - from each char-
acter's unique movements, to the
way they sing or talk, to the way
the cast members vibe off each
other on stage. It's obvious the
final product required an intense
amount of collaboration between
the cast and the production team.
"Everybody is really sharing
the weight the entire time, every-
body feels responsible for every-
bodyon stage ... everyone has their
eyes on the periphery so they can
help everyone else get through the
show," Gordon said.
"Spelling Bee" doesn't have
an intermission and is only 90
minutes long, so the cast mem-
bers have to be on their toes and
in character the whole time. The

audience is treated to an immer-
sive experience, which will have
viewers breathlessly rooting for
all the freaks and geeks on stage.
But Gordon does have one worry.
"My only concern now is that
I want to hydrate a lot before the
show, but I have terrible bladder
control, so I'm afraid I'll have to
run out of the theater. It is literally
my greatest fear," she said.
Despite the lack of bathroom
breaks, the show has another
aspect that sets it apart from
most musicals: It's interactive.
The final cast list for "Spelling
Bee" has yet to be determined,
as a couple of audience members
will be (voluntarily) picked to
join the rest of the offbeat char-
acters on stage during each show
to compete in the bee.
"The show never gets stagnant,
because it changes every night
depending on who's competing,"
Gordon said. "And we encourage
good spellers because it makes it
more exciting."
Nevertheless, the cast will
guide ambitious audience mem-
bers through the show. And,
added Spooner, "every speller gets
a juice box and a hug."
Spooner has one final piece of
advice before coming to the show.
"Brush up on your spelling
skills," she joked.

Nebraska-Omaha came to Ann
Arbor in late October (only the
fifth and sixthgamesofthe season
for the Wolverines) and split the
series. Twelve different Maver-
icks recorded a point in the series.
"You could have 20 guys onthat
team with 20 goals, but there's
only going to be probably three of
them on the ice at a time," Beren-
son said. "We've got to take care

the ice. We've got be able to out-
play or outscore or outcheck that
line when they're on the ice, who-

The goal dispersal isn't nearly
as impressive as the points. The
Wolverines themselves have

seven players with nine goals or
more (though one of those, junior
forward David Wohlberg, is out
for the season with a broken col-
larbone), but have just one player,
Hagelin, over 30 points.
"They don't have any 20-goal
scorers or30-goal scorers," Beren-
son said. "They have really good
players, but so do we. All those
guys with 11 goals on their team
and we've got a bunch of guys

Berenson said Sunday he would
scout all three teams in order to
be ready for any possible regional

beat the Tigers in the finals of the

'M' comes home, faces Spartans

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Writer
It might not count in the con-
ference standings, but don't tell
Anthony Toth that the Michigan
baseball team's series against
Michigan State doesn't mean any-
thing.
"It's Michigan State," the fifth-
year senior second baseman said.
"It's dumb that they're off our
schedule for BigTen since it is one
of our rivals, but it's still Michigan
State. We don't like them and they
don't like us."
Since the Big Ten decided to
rotate opponents for each Big Ten
team in an eight-series conference
schedule, the two rivals' games
this weekend will be considered
a non-conference affair. The two
teams will play Friday and Sun-
day in Ann Arbor while Saturday
afternoon's game will be held in
East Lansing. Friday's game will
be the Wolverines' first home
game of the year.
The in-state foes started off
their seasons going in opposite
directions. Michigan lost its first
seven games and dropped to 2-11
before eventually climbing up to
6-12 after a sweep in the Oesetrike

Classic at Eastern Michigan last
weekend. The Spartans, however,
came out of the gates hot. They
are 12-5 and currently lead the Big
Ten in both batting average (.335)
and ERA (2.74).
"We've typically been on the
other side of it," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said. "The early sea-
son has been a little bit reversed
from what we've usually experi-
enced. If you can win the series,
then all of a sudden, you can cer-
tainly make up for some ills."
Michigan's pitching, which
had been a sore spot for much of
the early spring, started to come
around in Ypsilanti last week-
end as all three starters regis-
tered quality starts. In a series
that brought a smile to Maloney's
face, Michigan's starting pitchers
picked up two wins, both of which
were polished off with saves.
Maloney will start the same
three starters who threw last
weekend - though in a differ-
ent order. Redshirt sophomore
Bobby Brosnahan, who pitched 7.1
innings in a win over Oakland on
Saturday, will start on Friday. In
East Lansing, redshirt sophomore
Tyler Mills will get the nod and
sophomore Kyle Clark will take

the mound on Sunday.
"Hopefully last weekend was
a little warm-up for those guys,"
Toth said. "To see Bobby back to
his true form like he was last year,
it's good for him and it's good for
the rest of the team. Clark's past
four outings have really been
lights out. He's really pitching and
not just throwing. Guys have a lot
of confidence in him."
If Michigan's pitching is able
to maintain its performance from
last weekend, the games could
turn out to be pitching duels as
Michigan State's starters average
a 2.18 ERA. And even though the
Wolverines picked up three wins
last weekend, their bats weren't
exactly on fire. Division-III Alma
College held Michigan to four
runs in a 12-inning game last Fri-
day and the Wolverines averaged
just 3.67 runs per game in the
series.
Michigan State's offensive
attack is spearheaded byinfielders
Torsten Boss, Ryan Jones and Jeff
Holm - all three of which were
named to All-Big Ten teams last
season. But, it's senior Brandon
Eckerle who has been the Spar-
tans' most pleasant surprise this
year. The leadoff-hitting center-
fielder leads the Big Ten in bat-
ting (.500), on-base percentage
(556) and hits (36).
The series against the Spar-
tans will provide a change of pace
- the Wolverines have dealt with
non-conference opponents and
have yet to face a traditional rival.
"They're a team that comes
out with a lot of hooting and hol-
lering, and we need to make sure
that we match their intensity and
hopefully get up on them early,"

going to be more energy. So we're
looking forward to them coming
into our house and us being able
to hopefully open our home sea-
son with a big win over them." 0
