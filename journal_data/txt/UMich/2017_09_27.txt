In response to yesterday’s 

protests 
regarding 
racist 

incidents 
on 
campus, 

Central Student Government 
executives solemnly addressed 
the assembly Tuesday night, 
urging representatives to stand 
with the demonstrators and 
actively listen to the concerns 
of their constituents.

CSG 
President 
Anushka 

Sarkar, an LSA senior, stressed 
the importance of maintaining 
the 
assembly’s 
purpose 
in 

representing the entire student 
body, including the voices of 
the demonstrations.

“You were all elected to 

represent students and their 
views,” Sarkar said. “If there’s 
enough hurt and frustration 
in the student body that these 
demonstrations are happening, 
it’s your job to engage with it so 
please make sure you do your 
due diligence to represent those 
voices and that they’re heard.”

While no official statement 

has been released by CSG, 
Sarkar took to her personal 
Twitter 
account 
speaking 

on behalf of CSG to weigh 
in 
on 
the 
demonstrations 

yesterday afternoon, standing 
in 
solidarity 
with 
the 

demonstrators.

Sarkar 
offered 
support 

and services to the student 
demonstrators.

“Folks engaged in these 

demonstrations — let us know 

how we can help. Water, fans, 
solidarity, let us know,” Sarkar 
wrote.

CSG Vice President Nadine 

Jawad, Public Policy senior, 
followed 
Sarkar’s 
statement 

by highlighting the emotional 
struggles students throughout 
campus are facing and offering 
strong condolences for the 
demonstrators.

“A lot of students on campus 

right now are really hurting 

and there’s a lot (of), honestly, 
sadness going around campus 
right now and a lot of people 
don’t feel safe and included 
right now,” Jawad said.

She spoke about the demands 

of recognition on behalf of the 
demonstrators, calling upon 
representatives to collaborate 
on ways to make the entire 
student body feel included.

“As representatives of your 

respective colleges I think we 

should really put our heads 
together to think about ways — 
not that we can solve the issue 
because that’s not a practical 
thing to say — but maybe just 
make a dent in making people 
feel included,” she said.

CSG 
Rep. 
Hafsa 
Tout, 

an LSA senior, began first 
reads 
of 
a 
resolution 
she 

co-sponsored, which allocates 
$3,500 to conduct a study by 

University 
of 
Michigan 

researchers have figured out 
a new way to help research 
subjects feel at home during 
experiments: actually doing the 
experiments in a home.

The 
BioSocial 
Methods 

Collaborative at the University’s 
Institute for Social Research 
unveiled 
its 
new 
HomeLab 

Tuesday. The “lab” is a fully 
functioning 
research 
facility, 

with one catch — it looks like a 
regular apartment. According 
to Richard Gonzalez, director 
of 
the 
BioSocial 
Methods 

Collaborative and ISR’s Research 
Center for Group Dynamics, the 
HomeLab has a fully functioning 
kitchen, bathroom, living room 
and bedroom. It also has hidden 
cameras 
and 
microphones, 

motion sensors and many other 
devices 
to 
help 
researchers 

collect data on their subjects in 
the most natural setting possible.

Gonzalez said the idea for 

the lab came out of a need for 
increased interaction between 
different fields of science.

Students advocating for new name for C.C. Little 
building lead protest to panel discussing change

AARON BAKER/Daily

Students protested on their way to the “To Rename or ot Remain” panel about the C.C. Little building, walking down North University Tuesday.

HALEY MCLAUGHLIN/Daily

A student speaks at the “To Rename or to Remain” panel about the C.C. Little 
building in the League Tuesday.

Hundreds of students, faculty members march to League to protest name, say eponym was a racist, relates building to current climate

Students 
and 
community 

members gathered together in 
the Diag Tuesday afternoon to 

protest the C.C. Little building 
name as well as other injustices 
facing the minority community on 
campus. Protesters rallied against 
the University’s continued use of 
Little’s name on campus buildings 
because of his work with eugenics, 
which 
often 
targeted 
women 

of color. The protest included 
a march that ended at a panel 

discussion hosted by LSA Student 
Government on the removal of 
Little’s name from the building.

Before 
reaching 
their 
final 

destination, protesters marched 
from the Diag to the Fishbowl, 
where 
they 
expressed 
their 

frustration toward the University 
with other students. Afterwards, 
white allies blocked the street as 

minority students marched to the 
panel held in the League Ballroom.

For LSA sophomore Diamond 

Berry, the protest was especially 
personal because her friends were 
directly impacted by racist acts on 
campus.

“Black people are being targeted 

on campus, and as a Black person 
I feel that I need to be out here in 

support of my people,” she said. 
“A few my friends were targeted 
personally, so I’m here to support 
the movement for equality.”

Once the protesters reached 

the panel, they were given an 
opportunity to talk about their 
own experiences, and explain why 
they advocated for the removal 
of 
Little’s 
name 

from campus. Many expressed 
discontentment about the amount 
of time that the University has 
taken to address this issue as 
well as the lack of answers that 
the administration has provided 
students.

freshman 
Tyler 

Washington said she had hoped

Over 
30 
students 
lined 

the halls of the University of 
Michigan 
School 
of 
Social 

Work Tuesday afternoon to call 
attention to an email sent by 
SSW Payroll Coordinator Kari 
Dumbeck, in which she implored 
students to respect the Pledge of 
Allegiance, with an emphasis on 
overtly religious rhetoric.

Dumbeck sent the email to the 

school’s Masters of Social Work 
listserv on Monday afternoon 
in response to Public Health 
graduate student Dana Greene’s 
decision to protest the number 
of pervasive racist incidents 
affecting Black students and 
students of color on campus. 
This year alone, three Black 
students have woken up to find 
racist vandalism in West Quad 
Residence 
Hall, 
anti-Semitic 

and anti-Black racial slurs have 
been spray-painted onto East 
Liberty and South State Street 
buildings and anti-Latino and 
pro-Trump graffiti have been 
scrawled on the Rock.

Every Wednesday, the

“I think it’s so cool that the 
University has been around 
for so long, and having 
been around for so long, 
many people recognize 
Michigan and what it does. 
It is really special to be 
here to celebrate that–– the 
bicentenniel is a cool way to 
start off my time here.”

LSA freshman Autumn 
McGuffie

Students were hoping to get 

their peers to turn up Tuesday 
on the Diag — turn up to vote, 
that is.

The Ginsberg Center for 

Community 
Service 
and 

Learning, in conjunction with 
Turn Up Turnout, a student 
group that aims to increase 
voter turnout among young 
adults, put on Register to Vote 
in the Diag. The event allowed 
students to quickly register 
to vote and acquire necessary 
information about voting in the 
2018 midterm elections.

The event, held on National 

Voter Registration Day, was the 
University of Michigan’s first 
major 
on-campus, 
in-person 

opportunity for students to 
participate in the Big Ten 

Voting Challenge, announced 
by University President Mark 
Schlissel in early September. 
For those students who were 
unable to attend the event in the 
Diag, event administrators are 
encouraging registering to vote 
online.

According to a statement from 

President Schlissel, 19 percent 
of 
students 
at 
universities 

throughout the country voted in 
2014, while the Ginsberg Center 
reports 14 percent of University 
of Michigan students voted that 
same year.

LSA freshman Archan Patel 

participated in the registration 
opportunity on the Diag, hoping 
to increase the number of 
undergraduate students voting 
in elections. 

“I 
heard 
about 
what 

the voting turnout was for 
undergraduates last year, and I 

wanted to raise the turnout for 
this year,” Patel said. “One way 
to do it is just go out and sign up 
for it.”

While more than 40 students 

marked themselves as “going” 
on the event’s Facebook page, 
students floated in and out of the 
booth on the Diag throughout 
the four hours it was available. 
Leaders of the event were also 
scattered throughout the Diag 
area, encouraging students to 
register to vote in Michigan.

Rackham student Madison 

McKenzie, graduate assistant 
for democratic engagement at 
the Ginsberg Center, helped 
run the event, stating Tuesday’s 
launch of the voting challenge 
helped 
promote 
enthusiasm 

among students in registering 
to vote and participating in 
elections. 

“I think the event is just one 
really big, exciting kickoff to 
a whole bunch of stuff that’s 
going to be coming in the 
next year and a half to really 
make sure that the students 
know and engage in this 
challenge, because it’s a great 
opportunity to make sure 
that students have their voice 
heard, and to beat the rest of 
the Big Ten Conference,” she 
said.

Erin 
Byrnes, 
lead 
for 

democratic 
engagement 

and America Reads at the 
Ginsberg Center, was also on 
the Diag encouraging students 
to register, and iterated the 
importance of the event’s 
long-term effects.

“The 
Big 
Ten 
Voting 

Challenge 
will 
definitely 

continue on. Our goal that 
we’re 
working 
toward 
is 

drastic or dramatic increase 
in student-voter — not only 
registration, but turnout for 
the 2018 midterm elections,” 
she said. “So we’re really 
looking 
to 
enhance 
those 

numbers, student involvement 
and 
participation 
in 
our 

elections.”

on Diag, encourages participation

The event took place as part of the Big 10 Voting Challenge announced by Schlissel

M AGIC MUSIC

JOSHUA HAN/Daily

The University Philharmonic Orchestra performs their first concert of the year at Hill 
Auditorium Monday. Their piece, Felix Mendelssohn’s Scottish Symphony, envokes an 
image of the artist’s visit to the ruins of th ePalace of Holyrood in Edinburgh in 1829. 
The whole work progresses through a musical stroll around the stones, arches, and half 
walls of the palace. The pieces are marked by somber tones, a folky section, magical 
textures, and a triumphant ending.

University officials would have 
had tangible solutions, especially 
because they have spent many 
years on campus dealing with 
these issues.

“Hearing another person higher 

up than me who has been here 
endless years — I’m a freshman, 
I’ve only been on this campus for 
three weeks and if someone else 
asks me, ‘Well what should we do’ 
— how are you going to ask me?” 
Washington said. “I’ve only been 
in college for three weeks. You 
work here, you’ve been through 
college, you have a degree, you’re 
doing your job, you should know 
the facts, you should know what 
you should be telling us.”

After most of the protesters 

had filed out, the panel and forum 
began again as originally planned. 
History professor Martin Pernick 
opened the panel by discussing the 
topic of eugenics in a broad sense 
and what role Little played in it. 
Pernick made the argument that 
being in support of the idealistic 
form of eugenics was not cause 
enough to remove a person’s 
name from the building they were 
named after.

“Eugenics 
meant 
a 
lot 
of 

different things to a lot of different 
people,” Pernick said. “Charles 
Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, 
defined it as the use of science to 
improve human heredity. Who can 

argue with that? Using science to 
improve things.”

Pernick 
explained 
Little’s 

interpretation of eugenics was 
what merited a renaming of 
the building named after him. 
According to Pernick, the type of 
genetics Little supported was one 
that promoted the advancement 
of those who held power in society 
in the early 20th century, through 
any means necessary.

“The kind of eugenics that 

Little promoted included all of 
the American Eugenics Society’s 
most 
controversial 
methods: 

compulsory 
sterilization, 
ban 

on 
interracial 
sex, 
selective 

immigration and restrictions by 
ethnicity,” Pernick said.

After Pernick concluded his 

speech, panelist and LSA senior 
Joshua Hasler explained Little’s 
life story. Hasler discussed Little’s 
work promoting eugenics before, 
during and after serving as the 
University’s president from 1925 
to 1929. He noted Little’s close 
personal relationship with Charles 
Davenport, a man that Hasler 
described as the “godfather of 
American eugenics.” During his 
time at the University of Michigan, 
Little helped organize and was 
the president of the Third Race 
Betterment Conference held in 
Battle Creek, Michigan.

“And as president of both the 

conference, a member of the 
American Eugenics Society, and 
president of this University, he 
played a crucial role in bridging 
the gap between East Coast 

eugenicists 
and 
Midwestern 

eugenicists,” Hasler explained.

American 
Culture 
professor 

Alexandra 
Stern 
spoke 
after 

Hasler and focused the majority 
of her time discussing parallels 
between the current debate over 
renaming the C.C. Little Building 
to those debates which have been 
held on other college campuses 
concerning their own buildings’ 
past history. Stern specifically 
cited the University of Virginia’s 
decision to change the name of 
their medical research facility from 
that of a eugenicist, as something 
she believes the University of 
Michigan should emulate.

All of the panelists, along with 

several other professors, have 
submitted an official request to 
have the C.C. Little Building be 
renamed and have created an 
online petition to garner support 
for their proposal. As of Tuesday 
night, the petition has received 
485 signatures since it was created 
on Sept. 1. That total includes 
over fifty signatures by University 
professors and deans, many of 
whom expressed their views on the 
issue of renaming in the comments 
section of the petition.

Mika LaVaque-Manty, director 

of the Philosophy, Politics and 
Economics 
program, 
offered 

one of the most strongly worded 
comments in support of renaming 
the C.C. Little Building.

“It is to honor, not degrade, 

the past and the present of the 
University of Michigan to revisit 
its values and commitments. When 

a thoughtful examination, such as 
the one that informs this petition, 
concludes the past commitments 
are inconsistent with our real 
values, it’s necessary to make 
changes. We should teach and 
learn from the legacy of Little; 
our buildings should not bear his 
name,” LaVaque-Manty wrote.

The petition has also gained 

support from the student body 
leadership with signatures from 
Central 
Student 
Government 

Reps. Jacob Cutler and Hafsa Tout 
as well as CSG President Anushka 
Sarkar, all of whom are LSA 
seniors.

Sarkar 
said 
Little 
was 
a 

problematic 
figure 
in 
the 

University’s past and that he 
should not be honored with his 
name on a University building.

“C.C. Little is emblematic of 

what is incredibly wrong about 
this University’s history, including 
putting big tobacco and eugenicism 
on a pedestal, quite literally on 
one of the largest buildings on 
campus,” she said.

Sarkar voiced her support for 

the decision last week by LSA SG 
to pass a resolution supporting 
the renaming of the C.C. Little 
Building. She also outlined a plan 
for how CSG should approach the 
resolution.

“I think that the resolution 

should be passed in every school 
and 
college-specific 
student 

government and that it should 
then be passed in Central Student 
Government to show that all 
nineteen schools and colleges 

individually 
support 
it, 
and 

therefore the entire University 
supports it, which is why our 
assembly passed it,” she said.

Those who have proposed the 

renaming acknowledge that there 
are still large swaths of students 
who have not heard about Little’s 
past and his beliefs on race. 
According to Hasler, part of the 
blame for this lies in the hands of 
the University itself. Hasler noted 
last semester’s Stumbling Blocks 
exhibit, though it outlined failures 
in the University’s past, failed to 
mention anything about Little and 
his advocacy for eugenics.

“They 
didn’t 
engage 
with 

C.C. Little and I think that’s 
an intentional choice, perhaps 
because it adds to the political 
climate 
and 
makes 
things 

potentially divisive when you talk 
about renaming a building,” he 
said.

Hasler would like to see the 

University rename the C.C. Little 
Building by the end of this school 
year.

“I think it’s something that 

we as a student body deserve … 
especially since we are living in 
such divisive and decisive times, 
this really requires immediate 
action.”

After the panel concluded, some 

student activists felt their concerns 
had not been adequately addressed 
by the forum and that there was 
continued work to be done on the 
issue of renaming the C.C. Little 
Building.

“After going into the meeting, 

there 
was 
this 
façade 
that 

everyone is on the same page as us 
and moving forward we shouldn’t 
have any issues, but the fact that 
we have to go through to the 
president, to get to the regents, to 
get C.C. Little changed is going to 
be ridiculously hard for us because 
we can’t even get the president to 
listen to open racists on campus, 
so how are we going to get him 
to listen to white supremacy on 
campus?” Washington said.

LSA SG President Nicholas 

Fadanelli, 
an 
LSA 
senior, 

concluded the forum by expressing 
his support for future dialogue 
about renaming the C.C. Little 
Building.

“And I just hope that all these 

people that came out here tonight 
sign the petition and we keep 
having this conversation … because 
this is an important conversation 
to have, as much as possible,” 
Fadanelli said.

LSA 
Student 
Government 

released a statement after the 
protest that acknowledged the 
protesters’ efforts and implored 
the University to rename the 
building.

“We would not only like to 

thank the activists who, for years, 
have fought for the name to be 
changed, but also faculty members 
who have dedicated years of their 
careers to investing who C.C Little 
was,” it read. “We continue to urge 
the University to change the name 
of the C.C Little Building to further 
the University’s mission of making 
an inclusive campus for everyone.”

years ago and we wanted to build 
a stronger interface between 
the biological and behavioral 
sciences,” he said. “We realized 
that one area of exciting new 
development is around the smart 
home, but what if we added 
biology to that? Sensors on 
the body that are recording all 
kinds of stuff. … So we thought 
about making a home lab. This 
way we can study these new 
possibilities.”

Collaboration 
is 
a 
big 

component of the HomeLab. 
It’s how it will run effectively, 
but it’s also how the lab was 
built. Jeannette Jackson, the 
managing 
director 
for 
the 

BioSocial Methods Collaborative, 
said students and faculty from 
the 
engineering, 
kinesiology, 

psychology 
and 
medical 

programs, among others, worked 
on putting all the pieces for the 
lab together.

According to Jackson, student 

involvement has been a big part 
of 
the 
HomeLab’s 
creation. 

Over 33 undergraduate students 
from all different disciplines 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
the 

HomeLab, including Engineering 
sophomore Cyrus Najarian, who 
has been working on the project 
since last August.

He said the teamwork and 

collaboration he’s experienced 
while working on the HomeLab 
have been very impactful and 
will make for a great research 
environment.

“In 
the 
collaborative, 
we 

obviously work as a team, but 
working 
on 
the 
HomeLab 

specifically really took that to the 
extreme,” Najarian said. “There’s 
always something that we were 
collaborating on other people 
for. I was working on multiple 
different things at the same time 
… and we were always trying 
to synthesize all of our own 
perspectives and experiences to 
getting things as close to perfect 
as possible.”

Thanks to this collaboration, 

the lab was finished less than a 
year after construction began 
last November.

“This is a new space for 

research that facilitates what 
we’re calling collaborative team 
science,” Jackson said. “(People) 
aren’t working on one little slice. 
When you work with us, you 
work with everything we’ve got 
going on.”

And the HomeLab already 

has a lot going on. The lab will 
be used to study mobility and 
cognition in older adults, and a 
research project from outside 
the University has already been 
lined up with Procter & Gamble 
to study adult incontinence.

Gonzalez thinks the HomeLab 

will bring more data to these 
projects than researchers would 
otherwise be able to collect.

“The (current) state of the 

art for that work is that you just 
ask people in a survey, ‘Do you 
have trouble washing dishes?’,” 
Gonzalez said. “And they say 
yes or no or rate on a five-point 
scale. But what our facility 
allows someone to do is actually 

observe people in a controlled 
environment like at a kitchen 
sink.”

Many 
future 
projects 
are 

planned. Gonzalez emphasized 
the 
lab’s 
compliance 
with 

Americans with Disabilities Act 
standards, so disability research 
would be a possibility. He’d also 
like to see intergenerational 
experiments in the lab.

“We’ve had lots of inquiries 

about mother-child interaction 
studies, and right now they 
just do those in a classroom in 
East Hall where Psychology is 
located,” he said. “It would be 
much more natural to run those 
studies in the HomeLab where 
there’s a bathroom, a playroom, 
maybe a sibling involved. You just 
get higher-quality data.”

However, 
running 

experiments in the home is 
not 
always 
straightforward. 

Psychology 
professor 
Jacqui 

Smith, who will do studies 
in the HomeLab on health in 
elderly populations, said the 
one-of-a-kind nature of the lab 
is exciting, but will require some 
extra thought when it comes to 
designing projects.

“We need to be really creative 

in the way that we design studies 
to be able to do this, and of 
course we need to get funding 
to actually do it,” Smith said. “I 
think this is very unique and my 
colleagues that I’ve spoken to at 
a recent international conference 
in San Francisco, everyone was 
really excited about this idea … 
I hope we can encourage people 
from many different disciplines 
to write this into their studies.”

of being a Black student at

supported by over 100 students,

movement many professional 
athletes are participating in

In 
the 
email, 
Dumbeck 

provided a link to a video of 
Red 
Skelton, 
an 
American 

entertainer, 
performing 
a 

monologue on the meaning of 
the Pledge of Allegiance. She 
drew upon personal beliefs 
and implied Dana’s actions 
disrespected her religion.

“Although I can understand 

Dana’s feelings I feel that he 
must be reminded that it is not 
through ‘man’ that ‘man was 
create (sic) equal,’ but through 
GOD,” she wrote. “And it is a 
testimonial to GOD that we live 
as he would want us to, for we 
only answer to him in the end.”

Dumbeck did not respond to 

the Daily for comment.

Social 
Work 
student 

Lawrielle West responded to 
the email thread, calling on 
Dumbeck to apologize for the 
harm she caused within the 
community and educate herself 
on the difference between one’s 
original intent and the actual 
impact it can have on a group of 
people.

“Intent versus impact is a 

thing, meaning that regardless 
of how you meant something, 
it can still negatively impact 
someone,” she wrote. “And 
that’s what this email did. 
Honestly, I personally don’t 
need an apology because I’m 
interested in you educating 
yourself, and spreading what 
you have learned from this in 
your 
community. 
However, 

an apology is needed to the 
public in an effort to start the 
process of restorative justice 
in a case where a staff member 

crossed the lines and triggered 
some students in the SSW and 
others.”

Dumbeck responded to West, 

writing she did not mean to 
offend anyone, yet continued to 
express a belief in her right to 
hold her own opinions.

“First let me say that I did 

not insult or diminish what 
Dana is doing by any means. 
That is not what I said or what I 
meant,” she wrote. “My opinion 
was expressed just as the 
emails opinion was expressed 
when sent out to all. The video 
I felt was something that all 
‘Americans’ would benefit from 
hearing, or so I felt. I did not put 
race into my thoughts at all. I 
only meant that we as ‘humans’ 
can do better when we look into 
ourselves and for what purpose 
do we serve. To each his/ her 
own.”

West explained the group 

of students showed up outside 
of Dumbeck’s office at 10 a.m. 
to begin the sit-in, but she had 
already left the building. After 
sitting in the hallway for a 
brief period, different faculty 
members told the group they 
had to move due to fire code and 
then called DPSS to assess the 
situation at hand. The students 
later moved to a larger space 
outside the dean’s office, after a 
DPSS officer advised they would 
be better seen there.

In an email interview, Lisa 

Raycraft, 
communications 

manager for the School of Social 
Work, affirmed an associate 
dean called DPSS because the 
protestors 
were 
blocking 
a 

narrow hallway.

“Space 
was 
available 
for 

students 
to 
continue 
their 

protest at either end of the hall, 
where the area is open. Students 
continued to sit and block the 
hallway. DPSS was called to 
assist with opening the hall so 
safety codes could be met,” she 
said.

However, 
Raycraft 
stated 

the School of Social Work 
recognized 
the 
protesters’ 

concerns 
as 
legitimate 
and 

various 
faculty 
and 
staff 

members discussed the matter 
over the course of the event. 

She said she could not comment 
on Dumbeck’s email, as it is a 
personal matter.

“The School of Social Work 

respects peaceful gatherings 
and the right of demonstrators 
to express their views,” she 
wrote. “The students today 
engaged in a peaceful protest 
in the SSW building sharing 
their concerns. SSW faculty 
and staff engaged with students 
throughout the sit-in.”

West 
expressed 

disappointment 
in 
how 

the School of Social Work 
responded to the protest — 
especially in the context that 
most of the students there had 
studied community organizing 
in classes within the building.

“My 
major 
is 
literally 

community organizing, so this 
is what I do,” she said. “When 
they tell me to move, I’m like, 
‘You tell me not to move, in my 
textbook it tells me not to move.’ 
”

She questioned where most of 

her classmates were during the 
six-hour sit-in, as they missed 
an opportunity to truly engage 
in their field of study.

“I’m Team 96, meaning that 

we’re the 96th class of School 
of Social Work, so everybody in 
my class is usually graduating 
this December or in April,” 
she said. “I’ll be graduating in 
April. I see some of us here, but 
like, that’s 400 people. So I’m 
like, OK, maybe 50 graduated 
already from one year. Maybe 
50 percent, like I said, are in 
field or in class. Where are the 
rest of the people? We’re all 
social workers, what does social 
work mean?”

Brendon Holloway, recent 

graduate of the MSW program, 
expressed the importance of 
ensuring that the voices of 
students of color remain in the 
center of discussion. He shared 
an email, signed by the MSW 
program as a whole, in which 
they expressed disappointment 
in Dumbeck for using such 
insensitive language towards 
such a diverse group of students.

the 
non-affiliated 
interfaith 

organization Interfaith Youth 
Core to gather information 
on religious and worldview 
perspectives of the student 
body.

The survey, also known as the 

Values, Interfaith Engagement 
and Worldview Survey, designed 
by the IYC, aims to empirically 
assess students’ perceptions of 
religious diversity on college 
campuses as well as students’ 
engagement 
with 
their 

corresponding worldviews.

According to Tout, the survey 

would provide CSG and the 
administration with a better 
understanding of the campus 
climate 
and 
perspectives 

throughout 
the 
University 

to help guide public policy 
construction.

“I 
think 
knowing 
and 

understanding on the whole 
what 
students 
perspectives 

are will be beneficial to us 
as student leaders in central 
student government and even 
more to the administration and 
it ultimately does play a part in 
policy formation,” Tout said.

Addressing concerns about 

student participation in the 

survey among the assembly, 
Tout stated that the survey 
would be conducted externally 
by 
the 
IYC, 
along 
with 

coordination by the Center for 
Campus Involvement’s Kelly 
Dunlop, who has signed on 
as 
the 
official 
institutional 

representative.

If 
passed, 
the 
survey 

would be conducted during 
the 
spring 
2018 
semester, 

followed by a comprehensive 
report by CSG’s Research and 
Polling Commission for use by 
University administration and 
student governing bodies.

A vote for the resolution will 

be held next week.

hen I walked out 
of 
my 
first 
class 

at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan, 
the 
sky 
was 

dark and the streets I had 
familiarized myself with during 
the daytime were foreign. Out 
of 
stubbornness, 
I 
avoided 

looking at the maps on my 
phone and began to walk with 
a new classmate. I tried my 
hardest to look like I knew 
where I was going and keep it 
cool. As I anxiously searched 
for a landmark that would send 
me in the direction home, I 
realized this transition was 
going to be more difficult than 
I imagined. 

College is not easy, and 

transferring can heighten this 
feeling. Whenever I discuss 
college with my older friends 
and family, they tell me the 
best years of their life were in 
college. Since the beginning of 
my college experience, I have 
been confused by this statement. 
How are these going to be the 
best years of my life? How could 
this be true for everyone? Is 
there a secret that I have not 
been let in on?

Last winter, when I decided 

to transfer to the University, I 
felt excited about the promise of 
my future. On the other hand, 
I also felt this great sadness as I 
was leaving a community that 
I had spent time and energy 
developing. During my freshman 
year at Michigan State University, 
I found myself searching for 
people that challenged me, lived 
active lives and had similar 
interests, but I had not joined 
any student organizations or any 
social groups.

During my final semester 

there, I decided I was going to 
get involved, and joined multiple 
student organizations, got an 
internship and worked in a 
lab. Even with this new busy 
schedule and social life, there 
was still something missing, so 
I went to Ann Arbor for a fresh 
start. I wasn’t excited about 
transferring, but I ultimately had 
to find a way to make my college 
experience the best for me.

I had two weeks to find 

somewhere to live before I 
moved to Ann Arbor, and a 
friend suggested I check out 
the Inter-Cooperative Council 
at the University. In need of 
housing, an instant community 
and with little time, I signed up 
to live in a house of 23 strangers. 
After trial and error in my 
social life, I thought this could 
be a way to seek people and 
community that was both active 
and challenged me. Little did I 
know this might have been the 
most important decision of my 
current college experience. 

In my house, I finally felt like 

I had a community to come 
back to when I came home 
after a stressful day of classes. 
This didn’t happen overnight, 
but occurred slowly over the 
course of my first semester. 
I want to make it clear that 
this was probably the most 
emotionally draining semester I 
had experienced. There was no 
instant transformation. It took 
time, and I was impatient to be 
happy with my experience.

Experiencing 
depression 

your first semester at a new 
university is quite common, 
as I learned in my positive 
psychology course. According 
to Steven Brunwasser, research 
instructor 
at 
Vanderbilt 

University 
and 
former 

Psychology Ph.D. candidate at 
the University, transfer students 
living off-campus experienced 
more 
depressive 
symptoms 

than freshman and transfer 
students who live on-campus. 
The 
depressive 
symptoms 

that the transfer students off-
campus had reported also did 
not improve by the end of their 
first 
semester. 
Brunwasser 

concluded that this must be 
from their lack of on-campus 
support and resources. Transfer 
students 
living 
off-campus 

are not given opportunities to 
engage with campus student 
life and the social networks that 
develop from them.

When I reflect on this period, 

I would definitely say that there 
were moments when I felt lost, 

and I see these now as signs of 
depression. I took comfort in 
knowing I was not alone in my 
experience. As the semester 
came to an end, I entered 
the spring still battling these 
symptoms, but I had friends and 
a community that continued to 
reach out to me even after I left 
Ann Arbor for the summer.

As a transfer student who 

continues to live off-campus, 
I was able to grow my campus 
social network through my 
cooperative 
home 
and 
the 

community of co-opers who 
attend our University. These 
were the individuals supporting 
and helping me navigate my 
first semester. My housemates 
have connected me to most 
of my closest friends, student 
organizations and university 
resources. 
They 
challenge 

me to become an active and 
involved student here at the 
University of Michigan.

As 
my 
second 
semester 

begins 
to 
play 
out, 
I 

understand now how to make 
my 
experience 
happy 
and 

fulfilling. Whether it is filling 
my schedule with activities or 
student organization meetings, 
practicing self-care or spending 
quality time with my friends, I 
am taking control of my college 
experience. With the support 
of 
my 
community, 
co-op 

housemates and new friends, 
I feel comfort in the fact they 
will be there for me as I take 
control and create my college 
experience. And I think that 
must be the secret of making 
these years the best.

If 
you 
just 
transferred 

or know someone who just 
got here, I am here for you, 
and there are other transfer 
students who are experiencing 
this 
unique 
path 
at 
our 

University. My best advice is to 
find your community and get 
involved as quickly as possible, 
because their support makes 
our large University feel a little 
more like home.

L

ast year, I had what 
could be called a mid-
college-life 
crisis. 
I 

switched my major four times, 
sliced my schedule down to 
eight credits and decided self-
teaching was more valuable than 
going to class. I even considered 
dropping out of college.

While making a dramatic 

exit excited me at first, I 
decided to take a skeptic’s 
approach to college. I began 
to 
research 
alternatives. 
I 

found a vocal community of 
college dropouts — or, as some 
refer to themselves online, 
“opt-outs.” I read the rants 
of frustrated students that 
sounded just like mine at the 
time. Frustrated by required 
courses, irrelevant material 
and the slowness of academia, 
they pondered leaving for the 
fast-paced freedom of the real 
world. They loved the idea of 
learning, but wanted it on their 
own terms. 

A 
cocktail 
of 
crushing 

debt, competitive admission 
standards and a shift in skills 
needed for jobs in the new 
economy has led many critics 
to question the value of going 
to college. With the advent 
of online programs and the 
development 
of 
alternative 

credentialing, 
students 
now 

have greater choice in whether 
to attend a university or to go 
to an alternative institution. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics 
reported in 2013 that of the 30 
jobs projected to grow at the 
fastest rate over the next decade 
in the United States, only five 
typically require a bachelor’s 
degree. To fill this gap, the 
alternative 
providers 
have 

swept in, promising students a 
new credential to secure these 
new jobs in less time with little 
damage to your wallet.

These 
educators 
have 
a 

dynamic set of unconventional, 
experiential 
learning 

techniques, usually promoting 
personalized instruction, and 
focus on teaching 21st-century 

skills like online marketing, 
coding and data analysis. Some 
lambast the traditional college 
education as deeply antithetical 
to learning. According to Dale 
Stephens, founder of UnCollege, 
“When you go out into the 
world, there’s no structure. … A 
job doesn’t give you a syllabus.”

I caught up with one such 

company, Praxis, when I began 
questioning college. Praxis is 
run almost entirely by college-
age opt-outs. Derek Magill, head 
of marketing for the startup, 
was a particularly enthusiastic 
ex-Wolverine, a Classics major 
who shunned Homer’s “Iliad” 
to train opt-outs like himself 
for jobs in the new economy. 
Magill’s 
frustration 
wasn’t 

sudden like mine — once head 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Young Americans for Liberty 
club, he sued the school for 
discrimination in funding of 
student groups before opting out.

While conventional wisdom 

holds 
that 
college 
molds 

you from a naive adolescent 
into a capable adult, Magill 
disagrees. He believes students 
party too much, make fake 
friendships and brag about 
being chronically behind on 
their studies. As he put it on 
Quora, instead of forging their 
way through their lives, “they 
actively sought opportunities 
to 
avoid 
class 
and 
patted 

themselves on the back for 
selecting the easiest classes.”

The 
research 
seems 
to 

back him up — his gripes have 
actually been quantified. In 
their 
book 
“Academically 

Adrift,” Richard Arum and 
Josipa Roksa found that 45 
percent 
of 
undergraduates 

at 24 institutions showed no 
significant 
improvement 
in 

a range of skills — including 
critical 
thinking, 
complex 

reasoning and writing — during 
their first two years at college. 
Derek wouldn’t be surprised; 
this 
was 
just 
evidence 
of 

students memorizing material 
to maximize their grade point 

averages 
instead 
of 
truly 

absorbing knowledge.

Yet 
many 
students 
are, 

rightly, 
bound 
to 
disagree 

with these sentiments. College 
is often regarded as a time 
of 
self-discovery, 
providing 

a space to test out a diverse 
array 
of 
interests 
with 
a 

safety net to fall back on. 
Unlike a job, where responses 
to failure are harsh, college 
lets students retake classes 
and lean on the support of 
similarly aged peers struggling 
with the same issues. This 
unique 
opportunity 
in 
a 

young person’s life should be 
cherished, not attacked as a 
naive false reality.

As disgruntled students tune 

in to opt-outs’ messages, more 
and more will drop out of the 
system. Until then, however, 
the opt-outs have an uphill 
battle to wage against one of 
the most ingrained societal 
expectations of young people.

Agree 
or 
disagree 
with 

the opt-outs’ conclusions on 
college, they do make valuable 
points about the changing 
nature of our economy. While 
students focus on attaining 
the 
best 
academic 
and 

extracurricular 
experience, 

they should dedicate equal 
time to independent projects 
that build their portfolios in 
whatever they want to do once 
they graduate. This could mean 
coding a new app with friends, 
publishing content online or 
interning at a startup.

In today’s economy, students 

must 
build 
experiences 

independent of their college in 
order to signal employability to 
others — degrees alone won’t 
get you a job like they did 
for our parents. This doesn’t 
mean get the cookie-cutter, 
coffee-fetching internship at 
an accounting firm — it means 
build things in the real world.

illennials get dumped 
on all the time — on 
TV, on the internet 

and at family gatherings. We’re 
called lazy, unambitious, self-
righteous, 
image-obsessed, 

egocentric cybernauts who would 
rather stare at our phone screens 
than have a conversation. Maybe 
some of this is true, maybe some 
of this is not. If our generation 
really is all of these things — 
which would be terrifying for 
the future of the United States 
— I don’t think any column could 
even remotely describe how 
much trouble we’re in. 

However, there is one clear 

issue our generation faces, 
and it’s not really our fault. In 
fact, this problem was dropped 
on us by baby boomers and 
Generation X. The issue is 
millennials have become so 
accustomed to an on-demand 
world that we expect success 
to be on-demand as well. The 
reason for this is that baby 
boomers and Generation X-ers 
ushered 
in 
a 
technological 

revolution that led to us getting 
whatever we want, when we 
want it.

Think about it: We grew 

up — or, at least, have spent 
the formative years of life — 
with Netflix, smartphones and 
Amazon next-day delivery. We 
hardly had to wait until Thursday 
night to watch our favorite TV 
show. If we wanted to know the 
size of Central Park, we didn’t 
have to walk to the library to 
check out a book — we have 
computers in our pockets. And 
for the last eight years, we’ve 
been able to use our pocket PCs 
to order a ride through Uber, 
meaning we rarely have to wait 
more than five minutes for a car 
to take us where we want to go.

This “on-demandness” is not 

a problem. In fact, it’s great; it 
has revolutionized our economy 
and led to hyper-growth in 
several industries, from ground 
transportation to grocery to 
restaurant. The economics is 

simple: It’s easier for people to 
buy goods and services, people 
buy more goods and services, 
businesses make more money, 
businesses use this money to 
innovate and expand, businesses 
can pay higher wages, people 
make more money, people spend 
more money. It’s a virtuous cycle. 
I have no problem with this, and 
neither should you.

But we’ve made the mistake of 

transferring our attitude toward 
Netflix — “I want to watch it now, 
so I’ll watch it now” — to more 
difficult, important things that 
generations before us had to work 
hard for. These things are not 
on-demand.

Take, for example, a millennial 

trying to learn calculus. If they 
apply their Amazon same-day 
delivery attitude to mastering the 
Taylor series — a representation 
of a function as an infinite 
sum of terms — they might be 
disappointed. Calculus is not your 
coming-soon Amazon purchase: 
You won’t get it that day or the 
next day and maybe not even that 
week or the next week. You have 
to work at it, sometimes for long 
periods of time. I think we look at 
this as a foreign concept now.

We need to understand the 

situation: Our generation has 
lots of advantages, and, as a 
result, we expect things to 
come easy. We get frustrated 
when they don’t. Inevitably, we 
quit, and we never make the 
progress we’re capable of.

This isn’t good, but it doesn’t 

mean we’re lazy, pretentious or 
unaspiring. It doesn’t mean we 
don’t care about people or hate 
talking to others. We just need 
to collectively realize a simple 
fact: things get better if you 
work at them. Most of the time, 
success won’t come right away. 
It’s not your Uber ride — it isn’t 
one minute away. This requires 
understanding that we are not 
going to score a touchdown 
on every play. But if we can 
move the ball down the field 
every time, if we can get a little 

better every day, eventually 
we’ll get somewhere.

An imperfect but somewhat 

illuminating illustration of this 
on-demand attitude came in 2008, 
when Barack Obama ascended to 
the presidency, partly because 
optimistic millennials supported 
him. Obama, armed with his 
hope-and-change 
rhetoric, 

won 66 percent of the vote in 
the 
below-30 
demographic. 

Come Inauguration Day, the 
American 
people 
(especially 

hopeful millennials) anticipated 
near-immediate change amid a 
financial crisis, two wars in the 
Middle East and the impending 
collapse of the U.S. auto industry.

It didn’t come, at least not 

right away. And though there 
are many variables that could 
have affected the following 
statistic, 
it’s 
worth 
noting 

that 60 percent of millennials 
supported Obama in 2012 — 
a high number, sure, but a 
noticeable drop-off from four 
years earlier, when we thought 
success would be immediate.

Again, 
this 
example 
is 

inexact. The precise reasons 
for Obama losing millennial 
support are hard to pin down. 
But my overarching point — 
that we too often hold the false 
belief that achievement is a 
one-step process — has been 
echoed by the former president 
himself. On “The Daily Show” 
in 2010, Obama modified his 
famous slogan: “Yes, we can,” 
he said, before adding, “but it is 
not going to happen overnight.”

Millennials 
should 
heed 

this modification. We can keep 
watching Netflix and using 
Uber, but we can’t transfer 
that same on-demand attitude 
to real life, where hard things 
don’t come easy. We just need 
to keep moving the ball down 
the 
field. 
Eventually, 
we’ll 

score a touchdown..

With a freshly bleached 

mullet mohawk and a distinct 
nomadic-desert-hippie 
vibe, 

singer Nicholas Petricca bobs 
along to the bubbly indie pop 
that 
Walk 
The 

Moon is famous 
for, 
as 
cheery 

as 
ever 
despite 

the 
relative 

barrenness of the 
desert landscape 
behind him.

Petricca’s 

wacky 
dance 

moves 
dominate 
most 
of 

the “One Foot” music video, 
interspersed with a few shots 
of a graceful dancer, the band 
together as a whole and a few 
shots of Petricca serenading 
the sky. From the first few lines 
of the song, it’s easy to figure 
out where the inspiration for 
the setting came from. “Not 
a soul up ahead and nothing 
behind / There’s a desert in 
my blood and a storm in your 
eyes,” Petricca sings as he 

stares boldly into the camera, 
a 
geometric 
stripe 
design 

running down each of his 
cheeks.

Both the production style 

and face paint are pretty 
consistent with Walk The 
Moon’s older aesthetic, seen 
on songs like “Quesadilla” 

and 
“Anna 

Sun.” Although 
“One 
Foot” 

isn’t 
terrible, 

it isn’t exactly 
groundbreaking, 
either, 
especially when 
compared 
to 

more 
bizarre, 

story-centered 
videos 
and 

even Walk The Moon’s own 
“Shut Up and Dance.”

Although the music video 

is lackluster, the song itself 
is undeniably catchy, with 
the same tireless energy that 
pervaded 
2014’s 
uptempo, 

positive Talking is Hard. The 
track is similar to “Shut Up 
and Dance” in terms of style, 
composition 
and 
energy, 

especially with respect to the 
chorus — both tracks have a 

memorable, 
chant-like 
line 

that contains the song title — 
though “One Foot” lacks the 
harder riffs that set “Shut Up 

and Dance” apart as more of a 
party song.

With 
Walk 
The 
Moon’s 

consistent sound and release 
style, 
dependability 
might 

be the band’s greatest asset. 
In an industry where artists 
are 
continually 
redefining 

their identities, Walk The 
Moon fans at least know what 
they’re getting.

The surprising depth and 
meaning in adult cartoons

Cartoons 
are 
often 
a 

childish, reductive medium. 
They take the forms of people, 
animals and places, break them 
down to their bare parts, and 
illustrate them. That being said, 
plenty of cartoons are visually 
appealing and stimulating — 
but for the most part, they are 
not considered high forms of 
art. Often, cartoon programs 
are directed towards children, 
but a good deal of them are 
directed 
towards 
adults. 

These programs often air on 
Adult Swim, the nighttime 
programming block of Cartoon 
Network. While adult cartoons 
often lean towards irreverent 
or absurd comedy, in recent 
years, there has been an uptake 
in high-quality content that has 
a striking amount of purpose 
and message. Programs like 
“Rick and Morty” and “BoJack 
Horseman” are changing the 
reputation of adult comedy for 
the better.

For the past decade or so, 

adult cartoons had mostly been 
directed towards the critique 
and 
lampoon 
of 
American 

culture. The stock formula is 
a middle-class family, with 
one son, one daughter, a baby 
and a pet or two. The longest 
running thirty-minute series, 
“The Simpsons,” does just that, 
having cemented itself in the 
hall of outstanding television 
many years ago. Variations on 
on the same theme, like Seth 
McFarlane’s 
three 
shows, 

“Family 
Guy,” 
“American 

Dad” 
and 
“The 
Cleveland 

Show” have been met with 
similar acclaim. The formula 
is tried-and-true, which has 

discouraged experimentation 
and ingenuity.

Adult Swim’s “Rick and 

Morty” 
has 
inverted 
this 

formula by changing some of 
the roles. Instead of the dopey, 
dumb father, grandfather Rick 
is a genius scientist across 
galaxies, 
and 
actual-father 

Jerry is ineffectual and plain. 
Rick is often paired with Morty, 
his grandson, who is hopeful 

and naive, but not stupid. The 
duo is a reworked Stewie and 
Brian from “Family Guy,” in 
a way, working with the same 
evil 
genius 
and 
simpleton 

dynamic that is referenced 
in countless other programs. 
“Ricky and Morty” also has a 
remarkable amount of depth 
in 
narrative 
and 
subject, 

taking place across countless 
galaxies and timelines. The 
blurring between real and fake 
that takes place is thought-

provoking 
and 
poignant 

without sacrificing too much 
meaning. 
Occasionally, 

cartoons are great ways to 
make 
larger-than-life 
ideas 

digestible.

Netflix’s 
“BoJack 

Horseman” completely ignores 
the stock formula and tackles 
themes in American culture 
that have often been ignored. 
The eponymous, washed-up 
sitcom star has to deal with 
his life after fame, with his 
then-contemporaries, like Mr. 
Peanutbutter, and PR agent 
quasi-girlfriend, 
Princess 

Carolyn. The show actually 
carries 
a 
main 
storyline, 

which is a deviation from the 
irreverence of adult cartoons, 
and is not told in a linear 
fashion. The audience sees 
snippets of BoJack in the past 
that inform the narrative that 
is playing out in the present, 
which leaves them without key 
points of information. BoJack, 
voice by Will Arnett (“Arrested 
Development”), has no family 
in the main characters, and 
the show turns to the fear of 
isolation more often than not. 
The creativity and novelty of 
“BoJack Horseman” shows the 
power of streaming companies 
to make content that is original 
without being derivative as 
other series. The genre of adult 
cartoons is stepping forward 
with its assistance.

Overall, 
accessible 
pop 

culture 
hasn’t 
had 
an 

interesting adult cartoon in a 
long time. At high points in the 
arc of a television show, seasons 
three and four, respectively, 
“Rick and Morty” and “BoJack 
Horseman” provide viewers 
with an unforgettable, quasi-
trailblazing moment in the 
history of television.

Walk The Moon maintains 
consistency in new video

Petricca’s wacky 

dance moves 

dominate most of 
the “One Foot” 

music video

Many argue that Skrillex 

has not had a vital new song 
in years — since either his 
chart-topping 
collaboration 

with Diplo and Justin Bieber 
(“Where 
Are 

Ü 
Now”) 
or 

his 
similarly 

ambitious 
crossover 
effort 

with 
A$AP 

Rocky 
(“Wild 

For The Night”). 
Meanwhile, 
others 
believe 

that Skrillex never created 
vital 
music 
in 
the 
first 

place, dismissing his wholly 
American 
translations 
of 

dubstep and dance music as 
computerized noise — viral 
fodder for the iGeneraton, sure, 
but undeserving of that sacred 
title: Art.

Both of these groups, of 

course, are absolutely wrong. 
Earlier 
this 
year, 
Skrillex 

released 
his 
highest-profile 

single 
in 
years, 
finally 

returning to his electro-alias 

after an oddly long hiatus 
during which he focused on 
running his label (OWSLA). 
That single — “Would You 
Ever,” a collaboration with 
go-to pop writer Poo Bear — 
is a melodious monster that 
instantly insinuates thoughts 
of sunshine and palm trees. 

It’s also one of 
Skrillex’s 
most 

beautiful tracks 
to date, despite 
not exactly being 
representative 
of 
his 
classic 

sound. Now, as 
if to compensate 
for 
his 
recent 

deviation from hardcore, the 
mega-producer has returned 
with a speaker-rattling remix 
of the year’s biggest rap song: 
Kendrick Lamar’s “Humble.”

Perhaps 
Kendrick 
never 

needed to hear his words 
reworked into an ear-melting 
bass drop, but besides that 
point, 
Skrillex’s 
“Humble” 

slaps harder than Batman in 
that 
ever-so-perfect 
comic 

meme. For an artist whose work 
is often recognized as noisy, 
perhaps borderline obnoxious, 

he makes effortless use of 
empty space, teasing listeners 
with a brief accapella lead-
in before employing anxious 
high-keys to initiate his assault. 
Eventually, jumpy snares and 
an intense pattern of whopping 
bass kicks arrive to foreshadow 
the song’s chorus, but even 
then, gaps between their kicks 
somehow leave sufficient room 
for Kendrick.

Obviously, once the drop 

arrives, there is no secret who 
the song’s remixer is: Listening 
to Skrillex’s “Humble” can feel 
something like standing next to 
an airplane that’s mid-takeoff. 
Yet, his softer, perhaps more 
musical capabilities are still 
ever-present in the production, 
a point that’s driven home by 
his inclusion of in-character 
space-synths (think “Cinema” 
or “All I Ask Of You”) within 
Kendrick’s second verse. For 
a moment here, one might 
wonder if the song is about to 
slow down.

It does not. Cue another 

“Shut up, bitch! Be humble,” 
and another drop. That is the 
Skrillex we fell in love with in 
2010.

Catherine Frot stars in ‘The Midwife’
Understated but lovely, 
‘The Midwife’ triumphs

Claire 
(Catherine 
Frot, 

“Heureux en France”) is a 
midwife who lives a quiet 
but pleasant life in a suburb 
outside Paris. Her placid days 
are interrupted by the return 
of a figure from her past, 
Béatrice (Catherine Deneuve, 
“Le Cancre”), the mistress of 
Claire’s late father. Béatrice 
is a force of nature whose 
free-spirited and unreserved 
personality 
clashes 
with 

Claire’s 
tempered, 
careful 

nature. And yet, Béatrice and 
Claire strike up an unlikely 
friendship, 
beginning 
when 

Béatrice reveals that she is 
dying of brain cancer.

“The Midwife” is a slow 

burn. Not much happens, per 
se, but the relationships are so 
carefully and gently developed 
that you find yourself engrossed 
nonetheless. Director Martin 
Provost (“Violette”) takes his 
time letting the characters 
warm up to each other, and 
the patience is well worth it. 
It’s a great film, not because 

it’s big or dramatic, but rather 
quite the opposite: it makes 
the most of the tiny intimacies 
in this quiet slice of life. The 

heart of “The Midwife” is in 
the details, carefully layered 
to create a work that’s rich and 
emotionally complicated.

The 
best 
moments 
are 

the beats between the big 
character 
confrontations, 

when we simply follow Claire 
through her life. Over and over, 
we see Claire birth a baby with 
expert skill and pass it on to 
the mother. She’s a constant 
witness to some of the greatest 
joys and pains these women 
will ever see, and she gives 
her whole heart to them, 
every time. It’s a masterful 
performance by Frot, equal 
parts warm, empathetic and 

heartbreaking as we realize 
her profound loneliness. That 
is, until Béatrice arrives.

Deneuve and Frot really 

bring out the best in each other. 
Just like their characters, they 
build on each others’ strengths, 
and their dynamic feels real 
and lived-in. Deneuve brings 
a certain vulnerability to the 
oftentimes callous and careless 
Béatrice, and in her capable 
hands, she becomes a character 
who’s more tragic than grating, 
which she so easily could 
have been. Together, the two 
actresses are a powerhouse 
team, and by the end of the 
film, you find yourself caring 
as much about them as they 
do about each other. It’s a 
testament to the writing and 

acting that a story as simple as 
this can achieve the emotional 

peaks it does.

It’s a beautiful movie. A 

little sad, a little funny, quietly 
triumphant, full of earnest 
feeling. It’s small and personal, 
but somehow feels universal. 
At its core, it’s about betrayal 
and friendship, romance and 
heartache, birth and death — 
and all the spaces in between.

There’s a moment near the 

end of the film when a young 
woman comes stumbling into 
Claire’s birthing clinic, in labor 
and all alone. It’s the middle of 
the night and the midwives are 
all on break, so nobody hears 
her as she cries out for help. She 
finds them eventually, and the 
six women help her through 
her 
birth. 
She’s 
supported 

from every angle, surrounded 
by these kind women who ease 
her fears.

We find out later that this 

young woman was one of the 
first babies Claire had ever 
helped birth, now all grown 
up and continuing the cycle. 
Claire wipes away a tear, and 
I can’t help myself — I do too. 
Because really, this is a very 
old story: Women taking care 
of each other, holding each 
other up through the pains in 
their lives, one day at a time.

What we miss while 
we’re looking down

You walk into the elevator. 

I’m standing right next to you, 
on my way down to floor one. 
This is our typical morning 
routine. You have pulled out 
your phone, your safety net 
of sorts, and your crutch to 
avoid the situation that you 
are now in. My eye contact 
has 
immediately 
prompted 

the movement of you taking 
out your phone, and pulling it 
closer to your eyes. You must be 
looking at something. The more 
I try to study the screen you’re 
so enthralled by, the more I 
realize I am mistaken. You’re 
not typing an email or a text. 
You’re not reading anything. 
You have your phone open to its 
home screen. And you’re just 
staring at it.

This situation exposes many 

problems — but my objective in 
describing it, is to discuss our 
lack of communication, both 
in terms of desire and ability. 
I want to really understand 
how on earth we have reached 
this point. Where suddenly, a 
20-second ride from floor six to 
floor one has proven impossible 
for most people to look up from 
their screens, and say “hi” to 
the person standing next to 
them.

You may be wondering why 

I didn’t say “hi.” Right? Here I 
am talking about how we don’t 
communicate at all with those 
around us and yet, I didn’t say 
anything first. Well, I’m afraid 
I’ll throw you off guard. I’m 
afraid you’ll look up, and feel 
forced to converse with me, and 
thus frustrated that I took you 
away from the crucial task of 
studying your home screen. I’m 
afraid I am taking you out of 
your normal morning routine. 
And most of all, I’m afraid 
that this has really become the 
normal morning routine.

Recently, I watched a video 

about 
a 
man 
named 
Otis 

Johnson, who was in prison for 
44 years. Following his parole, 
he was sitting in Times Square, 
observing the people around 
him, and was struck by the 
phenomenon of iPhones held in 
front of faces, and headphones 
plugged in. He noticed that 
everyone seemed to be talking 
to themselves. They didn’t 
look up to see where they 

were walking (really smart 
in Times Square), and they 
weren’t conversing with the 
people around them. This was 
puzzling to him, considering 
44 years prior, he remembered 
people were engaged, they 
looked around, and they talked 
to those around them.

To address what I think of 

technology and our generation 
of smartphones, I would have 
to compose a separate column. 
But it’s worth recognizing that 
we have become dependent 
on them in ways that stretch 
beyond sole convenience. We 
shouldn’t feel “thrown off,” 

or at times, really scared, if 
someone says “hi, how are 
you?” in public. Of course, 
every situation calls for proper 
judgment, and maybe there are 
moments when staying quiet 
really is most appropriate.

But in the elevator, on my 

way to class, I don’t think it 
is so outrageous to converse 
with someone who is also in 
the elevator, and maybe also on 
her way to class. However, it 
isn’t routine, and people simply 
don’t do it.

During my freshman year 

of college, we were all advised 
to attend the New Student 
Convocation, 
and 
when 
I 

attended with the rest of 
my residence hall, the CSG 
president at that time gave a 
speech, which urged us to “look 
up.”

He insisted that we look up 

and see what surrounds us, who 
surrounds us, and then engage 
with those things. There is 
about a two-week window at 
the start of the school year 
when it seems our student body 
commits to social interaction. 
Then we get started, we settle 
in, and we plug in. Many 

opportunities to engage, learn, 
grow, and probably meet really 
interesting, intelligent people 
quickly vanish as time goes on.

You can tell me you’re shy, 

you’re an introvert, you’re an 
INFP according to the Myers-
Briggs test, so it wouldn’t be 
natural for you to say “hi” to 
me first. I’m not suggesting 
we have a full out conversation 
about 
all 
our 
hopes 
and 

dreams in the elevator. I’m just 
suggesting we say “hi” to one 
another, and that that isn’t an 
odd thing to do. The speech at 

the convocation was built on a 
lot of truth, I just didn’t realize 
at the time that while observing 
those around me look down and 
disengage, I would become like 
them in the process.

The 
moments 
I 
have 

fought the urge to stay silent, 
I have actually met some 
wonderful people. Last year, I 
complimented a girl standing 
next to me on the pants she 
was wearing. She thanked me, 
asked what I was studying, 
and I later explained that I 
hope to attend law school. She 
then told me she was in the law 
school, and she still remains a 
good friend that I go to for my 
various pre-law questions. It 
took almost nothing to talk and 
discuss our interests.

Saying “hi” to the person 

next to you is probably not 
taking you away from anything 
important most of the time. If it 
is crucial that you respond to an 
email or text, I can’t stop you. 
But my message is clear: look 
up. Look around. Engage with 
all that surrounds you. You 
might like what you see.

Wolverines upset No. 9 Wisconsin

Due largely to a list of injuries 

that seems to only grow, not 
much has gone as expected for 
the Michigan women’s soccer 
team this season.

Sunday’s game at Wisconsin 

was no exception — but for a 
different reason.

The Wolverines had fought 

Minnesota to an exhausting 
double-overtime 
draw 
just 

three days earlier, and took the 
field against the ninth-ranked 
Badgers in sweltering, 90-degree 
heat with five starters unable to 
play.

But Michigan (2-1-1 Big Ten, 

5-2-4 overall) did the unexpected 
again, upsetting Wisconsin, 2-1, 
in overtime for its first victory 
over a top-10 team since 2014 
— which also came against the 
Badgers.

After surviving being outshot, 

39-7, by the Golden Gophers 
on Thursday, Sunday’s contest 
started much the same way. 
The Badgers (2-1, 8-2) took the 
first six shots of the game as the 
Wolverines attempted to absorb 
pressure with an atypical five-
player defensive back line.

However, just as Minnesota 

didn’t score until the 76th minute, 
Wisconsin similarly struggled to 
break through. Despite a 12-2 
Badger advantage in attempts, 
Michigan led at halftime, 1-0, 
thanks to sophomore center back 
Jada Dayne’s goal in the 37th 
minute.

“Our biggest strength was 

really great team organization 
and defending,” said Wolverines 
coach Greg Ryan. “They just 
didn’t give Wisconsin many 
chances. That took all 11 of them 
to do that.”

Added junior forward Reilly 

Martin: “We knew that we were 
going to have to defend for 90 
minutes to keep this game close, 
and our back line really gave an 
unbelievable performance.”

The Badgers equalized when 

forward Dani Rhodes fired a 

penalty 
kick 
past 
Michigan 

senior goalkeeper Sarah Jackson 
in the 55th minute. However, it 
was around that point when the 
complexion of the game changed.

After 
Rhodes’ 
goal, 
the 

Wolverines 
took 
control, 
as 

they fired off nine shots and 
earned four corners compared 
to Wisconsin’s six and zero, 
respectively.

This 
shift 
was 
aided 
by 

Michigan’s defensive strategy 
of staying behind the ball and 
waiting for scoring chances on 
the counterattack. This style 
of play allowed the Wolverines 
to expend less energy than the 
Badgers, and eventually wear 
them down enough to gain the 
upper hand.

“We got stronger as the 

match went on and they faded 
as the match went on,” Ryan 
said. 
“Maybe 
they 
punched 

themselves out a little bit. They 
definitely didn’t have the same 
level of energy.”

This fatigue could be observed 

most in Wisconsin’s back line. 
In the late stages of regulation, 
Michigan carved out a number 
of terrific chances behind the 

Badgers’ defense. Martin missed 
a volley over Badgers goalkeeper 
Caitlyn 
Clem 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore midfielder Katie Foug 
couldn’t find an open net in the 
89th minute.

But despite these near misses, 

it was clear that the Wolverines 
had momentum on their side 
heading into overtime.

“We knew once we got into 

overtime that we were going 
to finish the game and win it,” 
Martin said.

They did — and it was Martin 

herself who scored the winning 
goal in the 96th minute to finish 
off Michigan’s biggest win in 
years.

While youth and inexperience 

— the Wolverines started four 
freshmen against the Badgers — 
could have derailed their chances 
of an upset, Ryan credited the 
play of Cooper, Sarah Stratigakis, 
Nicki Hernandez and Samantha 
DeVecchi as key to the victory, 
calling their execution of the 
game plan “perfect.”

“It’s 
fabulous 
from 
a 

confidence standpoint knowing 
that you can put in a lot of young 
players to fill big shoes and 

they can do this well against a 
top-10 opponent,” Ryan said. 
“Confidence for those young kids 
is sky high, and confidence for 
the whole team is sky high.”

Cooper stood out in particular 

for her performance, as she 
started at a completely new 
position — outside back — on 
Sunday.

“She was outstanding all day,” 

Ryan said. “She got forward well 
and attacked well, she had a great 
chance to score a goal and she 
defended very well.”

Meanwhile, 
Stratigakis, 

Hernandez 
and 
DeVecchi 

impressed in the midfield as 
well, providing solid offense and 
defense for Michigan.

“You 
don’t 
expect 
three 

freshmen midfielders ... to be 
up to the task against a top-10 
team in the midfield,” Ryan said. 
“But they really, really held their 
own.”

Michigan now has four days 

to recover from a grueling two-
game stretch and prepare to 
take on Iowa at home Friday. But 
after an unexpectedly successful 
road trip, there’s no doubt the 
Wolverines have earned the rest.

Michigan notched its first win over a top-10 team since 2014 on Sunday.

Junior forward Reilly Martin scored in the 96th minute to seal an upset over the ninth-ranked Badgers on Sunday.

FIELD HOCKEY
Way’s clutch scoring
leads ‘M’ once again

Junior forward Emma Way 

is no stranger to netting game-
winning shots. In fact, she’s 
no stranger to scoring game-
winning goals against rival 
Ohio State either, having scored 
the go-ahead goal against the 
Buckeyes her freshman year 
during the regular season finale.

On Friday, Way and the 

Michigan field hockey team (3-0 
Big Ten, 7-2 overall) shocked 
Ohio State (0-3, 4-5), again 
scoring the game-winning goal 
with just 20 seconds remaining 
in 
overtime 
to 
give 
the 

Wolverines a 1-0 victory.

Over 
the 
course 
of 
her 

Michigan 
career, 
Way 
has 

managed to score or assist on an 
astounding six game-winning 
goals, netting five of them herself. 
As a freshman, Way scored or 
assisted on two overtime goals 
in the Big Ten Tournament, 
marking the beginning of her 
game-winning tendencies. From 
then on, she has not only provided 
the Wolverines with a clutch 
X-factor, but has contributed a 
steady offensive effort as well, 
finishing last season with six 
goals and four assists. Against 
the Buckeyes, Way managed 
to connect despite Michigan’s 
offensive struggles throughout 
the match.

“The 
game 
was 
out 
of 

character for us,” said fifth-year 
forward Carly Bennett. “We 
weren’t as aggressive as we had 
been, but we luckily ended up 
winning.”

The 
Wolverines 
definitely 

looked 
more 
in 
character 

offensively Sunday, decisively 
beating No. 3 Penn State (2-1, 
8-2), 3-0. Bennett, a captain for 
Michigan, relied on her work 
rate to set the tone when other 
elements weren’t clicking for the 
Wolverines.

“I just always give 100 percent 

effort,” Bennett said. “I think 
everyone sees that and steps 

up. I actually also had a word 
with (sophomore forward) Meg 
Dowthwaite after the Ohio State 
game. I told her that we needed 
her to step up.”

That’s 
exactly 
what 

Dowthwaite 
did. 
Scoring 

once in the match against the 
Nittany Lions, Dowthwaite was 
instrumental in the Michigan’s 
statement win against Penn State. 
The Wolverines’ game plan has 
consistently been to score early 
and often, with success coming 
when Michigan can effectively 
run its offense in the circle — a feat 
the Wolverines achieved Sunday.

“We just had great team 

cohesion,” said senior goalkeeper 
Sam Swenson. “We followed the 
game plan well and our transitions 
were sharp — everyone on the team 
just plays really well together.”

On the other side of the 

field, 
Michigan 
has 
played 

tremendous defense, as it has 
maintained shutouts in its past 
five contests. This weekend’s 
matchups cemented the team’s 
stellar defensive reputation as 
Swenson had eight saves against 
Ohio State and seven saves 
against Penn State.

“Sam Swenson was huge 

today,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “She made 
some huge saves. The whole 
team was great defensively and 
we shut them down today.”

The 
defense 
has 
shaped 

up to be the anchor for the 
Wolverines. 
Regardless 
of 

how well the offense has been 
performing, Swenson and her 
teammates 
consistently 
shut 

their opponents down and kept 
Michigan competitive at any 
time during a match, placing 
itself among the country’s most 
elite field hockey teams.

“This is what we practice,” 

Bennett said. “We need to forget 
about how we played in the past 
and just come out and do our 
jobs.” Against the Buckeyes, they 
did just that. The defense bought 
time, then Way repaid them for 
it.

Evans finally makes his case 
in running back competition

Chris Evans said Saturday 

at Ross-Ade Stadium felt like a 
homecoming. 

For 
the 
Boilermakers, 
it 

literally was. But it was Evans 
— the Indianapolis, Ind. native 
— who took the spotlight like it 
was his, finishing with a team-
high 14 carries, 97 yards and two 
touchdowns.

Prior to Saturday, though, 

the Michigan sophomore back’s 
season hadn’t been running 
according to his plan. Coming 
off a stellar freshman campaign, 
Evans was essentially pegged 
as 
the 
Wolverines’ 
next 

starter after an Orange Bowl 
performance that saw him give 
Michigan the late lead with a 
30-yard touchdown run before 
Florida State’s comeback.

And in Michigan’s season-

opener, 
everything 
went 

according to that script.

Evans took the field for the 

Wolverines’ 
first 
snap, 
and 

turned in 88 yards on a team-
high 
22 
carries. 
The 
only 

problem, though, was that fifth-
year senior Ty Isaac outdid him 
— turning 11 carries into a team-
high 114 yards.

After 
that 
game 
and 
in 

the week that followed, Jim 
Harbaugh was relatively mute 
about if Isaac’s performance 
had earned him the starting nod 
over Evans. Against Cincinnati, 
everyone got an answer.

Isaac took the first snap. He 

got 19 more. Evans got five.

Against Air Force, it was the 

same story. Evans carried the ball 
six times. The rest of the team 
rushed a combined 36 times.

And 
even 
after 
Isaac 

sustained a minor injury against 
the Falcons, Evans wasn’t given 
his starting role back.

Instead, it was passed to 

fellow sophomore running back 

Karan Higdon in Michigan’s Big 
Ten opener against Purdue this 
past weekend.

But finally, Evans got his 

chance to be the premier back 
again.

Higdon’s 
fumble 
midway 

through the third quarter ended 
his day, as he didn’t receive 
another carry for the rest of the 
game. Evans filled the void, and 
he didn’t let the opportunity 
slip.

The first touchdown rush, 

Evans admitted Monday, never 
looked good during the practices 
leading up to Purdue. But they 

tried it anyway, and Evans 
reaped the benefits — taking a 
toss 10 yards, untouched into 
the end zone to put Michigan 
ahead, 14-10, with just under 
two minutes to play in the third 
quarter.

“Every time we ran (the) toss 

that game they bit on it,” Evans 
said. “They would bite on it fast 
and break hard. We just creased 
them up the middle.”

From 
there, 
Michigan 

slammed on the gas pedal 
and Evans provided the final 
exclamation point. 

With 
just 
under 
seven 

minutes remaining, Evans lined 
up in the backfield. He took the 
handoff from fifth-year senior 
John O’Korn, and the hole 
opened up.

“I know that it was bonus,” 

Evans said. “Everytime I hear 
‘bonus’ I know everybody is 

gonna get blocked. … I just knew 
I trusted my coach and my 
landmark and all my coaching 
that I had all week. They left one 
dry, and I just — you know, that’s 
my job, to make people miss in 
space.”

Evans did his job, beating 

the safety and taking off for 
a 49-yard touchdown that — 
barring a miracle — put Purdue’s 
hopes of an upset in West 
Lafayette out of reach.

The 
Wolverines’ 
affinity 

for 
scoring 
in 
the 
fourth-

quarter has become a risky, yet 
encouraging, trend. Michigan 
is outscoring opponents 43-0 
in the final frame through four 
games, but more often than not, 
there hasn’t been much scoring 
up to that point.

“I feel like it comes down to 

the workouts over the summer,” 
Evans said. “When we gotta run 
16 gassers and it comes down to 
the 14th one, the 15th one, and 
everybody’s tired, and we know 
that everybody else is doing this 
so we gotta make sure we get 
the time. It just carries over to 
the game.”

As for Evans’ role with the 

Wolverines, there’s no telling 
who will be out there for the 
first snap against Michigan 
State. Harbaugh has been vocal 
in saying that he is willing to go 
with the hot back. Right now, 
that’s Evans, but the rotating 
door could still keep turning.

As 
for 
the 
impact 
a 

performance 
like 
Saturday’s 

can have for Evans personally, 
he stressed that it simply makes 
him push himself more — not 
because of the stable of backs in 
Ann Arbor, but because of the 
ones he will be facing from Penn 
State and Ohio State.

“It’s gonna make me work 

harder,” Evans said, “because I 
know that Saquon (Barkley) and 
J.K. (Dobbins), they out there 
working too.”

The picture stays in the kid: Plastics

T

he first time I watched “The Graduate,” 
I watched for the romance between the 
freshly graduated Benjamin Braddock 
and the older Mrs. Robinson. The 

second time, I watched for the romance between 
Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson’s daughter, Elaine.

Now, I watch for plastics.
“Plastics.”
It’s one line in the movie, and one played 

for laughs with a brusque and confident, yet 
ultimately not terribly memorable, effect.

But that line, terse and direct, is a perfect 

encapsulation, 
almost 
synecdoche, 
of 
the 

trappings of modern professional aspirations.

Benjamin is at his graduation party, but 

from the guest list, it would hardly seem so. 
Everyone at the party is a friend of his parents 
— they offhandedly toss their congratulations 
to the newly anointed adult in between other 
conversations that hardly concern him.

Mr. McGuire, one of the guests, starts talking 

to Benjamin by the pool. He puts his hand on 
his shoulder and promises the future — business 
success, self-confidence, a house in the suburbs 
with a lawn, a wife and two kids, the whole 
10 yards, because nine yards isn’t quite good 
enough. It rests on one word.

“Plastics.”
Mr. McGuire may have made a savvy market 

prediction — the plastic industry has done quite 
well — but Benjamin would have found his life 
as synthetic as the material itself.

*
I have absolutely no idea what I will be doing 

in one year. For the first time in my entire life, 
the calendar is open. I don’t know where I’ll be, 
what work I’ll be doing, what friends I’ll still be 
in contact with. Will I live at home? Will I be 
self-sufficient? Will I be dead?

The anxiety has set in. I’ve lost the naivety of 

a dreamer. The day-to-day costs required of a 
comfortable life more tactile and consequences 
of failing to find employment are palpable.

My career search starts with wondering 

what I want to do in my life, but that question 
is difficult to answer. Not for lack of hobbies 
or interests, but rather because I don’t know 
whether my work will be capital-I Important 
when I die. I’d love to be a magazine writer, 
but will my writing end up in a landfill? Even 
if it’s read, will it help anyone? How do I live a 

satisfying life if I can never be satisfied?

So there’s that anxiety. There’s also the base 

anxiety of not finding work in the first place. 
Try as I might, following certain writers on 
Twitter is no guarantee of future success.

During my middle school graduation, the 

principal said a significant chunk of our class 
would be working in industries not yet existent. 

The industries are clear now: augmented reality, 
virtual reality and the like. But I lack the skills 
and interest in these lucrative markets. I like to 
write. I like the news. I like art. And jobs that 
reward someone modestly skilled with common 

interests are few and far between.

But even given the opportunity to work 

in such an industry, I’m worried that, come 
my death, I’ll look back on a life that was not 
particularly worthwhile. A life composed of 
small assignments, of one or two viral tweets, of 
a frivolous notion that I might like to enjoy what 
I do for a living. The audacity!

I am plagued by the concerns of a life not yet 

lived. And yet I am troubled by the life that has 
so far passed by — regrets of nights spent inside 
and decisions not made, of sunny days spent in 
the dark and rainy days spent dry.

*
The point of the plastics line is to illustrate 

a gap between baby boomers, disillusioned 
with the future — Benjamin is constantly seen 
underwater — and their parents, many of whom 
labored to achieve a middle-class life. That labor 
included, and still includes, factory jobs, desk 
jobs: working at a company with little personal 
connection, with the ultimate goal of the 
ability to raise children comfortably in a secure 
retirement.

That dream doesn’t seem so appealing to me. 

Once, I thought an interest in law would be 
enough to keep me afloat through a corporate 
law job so I could eventually do less lucrative, 
but more personally fulfilling, legal work. 
Nowadays, the prospect of three years in law 
school, let alone the miserable career that would 
follow, doesn’t seem so appealing.

In a perfect world — or more to the point, in 

a world in which I have a career interest that’s 
fully satisfying and personally rewarding — I 
may not have these concerns. If I were to work 
as a doctor, for instance, each day would be an 
opportunity to save a life or help someone feel 
better. Instead, I feel selfish for pursuing a 
career in media.

Maybe spending nine hours in an office every 

day doing something not that interesting for good 
pay is respectable. But it’s not notable. I feel like 
if I end up in that sort of work, I’ll feel like I’ve 
failed. That I’ve wasted my one shot at life. That 
I’ve given up. But if the alternative is a life that 
is, in the grand scheme of things, only slightly 
more fulfilling and personally intriguing, but 
still ends in the same feelings of regret, then I 
don’t think I’ll feel terribly satisfied either way.

Maybe plastics aren’t so bad.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 27, 2017

ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN TOLAR


A

s a Muslim, I 
quickly 
learned 

that the claims 
of this being an 

inclusive campus were not 
as earnest as I originally 
anticipated. 
Every 
year 

I find myself expecting 
instances 
of 
hate, 
and 

thus far I have never been 
proven wrong.

For many students with 

minority 
identities 
on 

campus, issues like the 
recent racist vandalism in 
West Quad Residence Hall 
are simply expected. This 
is an issue demonstrated 
over 
and 
over 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan, 

as the administration and 
faculty alike often ignore 
the recurring acts of hate. 
It is only a question of 
when these incidents will 
occur, rather than if they 
will occur. Yet the question 
of who can talk about these 
issues is one that often halts 
conversations that could 
create any real change.

I am lucky that I feel 

supported in writing about 
my experiences on campus, 
but I also know this can be 
a challenge itself. Although 
I do receive a lot of support, 
I also get a lot of concern 
about attaching my name 
to such strong opinions 
and putting a spotlight on 
myself. I feel, though, that 
the spotlight is already 
on me in a way — as 
everywhere I walk my hijab 
reveals that I am Muslim — 
so I might as well use it for 
something.

As a future educator, 

I also know publicizing 
personal opinions can be 
a problem when searching 
for, 
and 
keeping, 
jobs. 

Teachers 
are 
generally 

discouraged from sharing 
too many of their opinions 
with their students, unless, 
of course, most parents 
share that same opinion. 

So though many newer 
teachers 
have 
in-depth 

knowledge on social issues, 
the discouragement from 
helping 
society 
move 

forward is one that a lot of 
teachers have to navigate, 
when teachers can often be 

one of the most important 
catalysts of social change. 
Similarly, 
issues 
of 

diversity are not always 
directly spoken about in 
class and people are often 
not expected to understand 
nuances of diversity or 

appropriate speech until 
they are in the workplace.

This 
university 
only 

serves as a microcosm of the 
country as a whole, where 
the line between acceptable 
and unacceptable speech 
begins to blur, and people 
are taking advantage of 
the 
opportunity 
on 
all 

sides. 
As 
Americans 
in 

2017 take to the streets 
with torches in the name 
of white nationalism and 
Nazi slogans, the question 
of where the line is seems 
to disappear.

The campus debates over 

how to handle incidents 
of 
hatred 
reflect 
the 

greater 
national 
debate 

on 
how 
such 
incidents 

should be handled. The 
debates surrounding Colin 
Kaepernick 
kneeling 
for 

the national anthem only 
intensified after President 
Donald 
Trump 
publicly 

stated anyone that who 
kneels 
for 
the 
national 

anthem in the NFL should 
be fired. In the aftermath 
of 
this 
statement, 
the 

response from NFL players, 
NBA players and fans alike 
began to break another 
barrier — one that often 
keeps professional athletes 
silent.

The distinction between 

“hate speech” and other 
forms of “allowable” speech 
being pushed for by some 
campus voices is a specific 
point of contention. There 
is no concrete definition of 
“hate speech” in American 
case law that can legally 
be curtailed, though such a 
distinction exists in many 
European 
legal 
systems. 

And yet, it is only when 
hate 
speech 
is 
publicly 

condemned and restricted 
in various ways that society 
moves forward as a whole.

In the same way that 

condemning 
practices 

like 
blackface 
or 
Nazi 

propaganda 
undoubtedly 

moves society forward, hate 
speech should be classified 
as wrong. But this is often 
not the case. People often 
use the guise of free speech 
to justify verbal harassment 
and hate speech without 
realizing that there is a 
moral logic behind many 
of the laws that govern 
society. 
To 
claim 
that 

there 
is 
no 
underlying 

morality or to trust that 
people 
understand 
hate 

speech using their own 
judgements is unrealistic. 
The question of why speech 
is the exception to the rule 
remains unanswered, and 
when certain instances of 
hate speech go from being 
acceptable to unacceptable 
only happens over a great 
deal of time.

Rather than have clear 

sets of rules defining hate 
speech, this keeps incidents 
of hate on campus and in 
the United States as a whole 
“debatable.”

Year after year I see the 

same incidents on campus 
and across America. I see 
glimmers of hope as people 
come together to condemn 
hate, 
but 
the 
mental 

barriers have to be broken 
if there can be any hope to 
move forward. My identity 
as a Muslim and a future 
educator encourage me to 
protest hatred on campus 
and in society.

When 
the 
ideal 

expectation is for people to 
correct one another, how 
is this supposed to happen 
when so many are asked 
to be silent? As a minority, 
Muslim, 
and 
future 

educator, I struggle with 
this question each time I 
choose to speak up even 
when some might find my 
opinions to create a biased 
lens. And yet it seems that 
some 
issues 
are 
worth 

kneeling for.

HOW DID WE GET HERE?

Six decades of challenging the University’s administration 

b y T i m o t h y C o h n, Senior News Editor

At 7 a.m. on Monday, first year Public 

Health student Dana Greene faced the flag-
pole and took a knee at the center of the Diag.

On Sept. 16, racist graffiti was found on 

LSA sophomore Travon Stearns’ West Quad 
Residence Hall door. The following day, 
posters stating support of Dylann Roof — 
the white supremacist and mass murderer, 
who killed nine people at a historically Black 
church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 and is 
now on death row — were found on a mural 
in downtown Ann Arbor. 

In a letter to University of Michigan Pres-

ident Mark Schlissel, Greene expressed his 
frustration with campus apathy toward the 
recent racist incidents of vandalism that 
have plagued the student body since school 
started just a few weeks ago.

“I will kneel in the Diag facing the flag in 

silent protest until there is nothing left in 
me,” Greene’s letter reads. “I am prepared to 
miss class and work for a simple idea. I am not 
kneeling in disrespect to our troops or to our 
country. I am kneeling because we should 
be better than this. I am kneeling because 
I am tired of doing nothing. I am kneeling 
because I want this campus and this country 
to acknowledge a fact that I know to be true. 
We are not and have never lived by the idea 
of our founding that ALL men are created 
equal. I am kneeling because we our (sic) 
better than this.”

Hundreds of students joined Greene as 

the day wore on, pitching tents, providing 
food and Gatorade and — of course — kneel-
ing beside him in solidarity.

The same morning Greene took his spot 

in the Diag, a student protest blocked North 
University Avenue, preventing buses and 
traffic from following their usual routes.

Throughout the hot day and well into the 

night Greene continued to kneel. Finally, at 
about 4 a.m., after 21 hours of kneeling in 
almost total silence near the iconic block ‘M,’ 
Greene said “I think I’ve said enough.”

Greene’s activism on Monday did not 

occur in a vacuum — rather, it was a cre-
scendo within decades of unrest between 
students and the University administrators 
along issues of race and inclusion on campus. 

Civil rights activism on campus has been 

central to student social justice activity 
since 1968, when Martin Luther King Jr. was 
assassinated, prompting the University’s 
Black Student Union to stage a historic sit-in 
of more than 100 people in the LSA building 
until the University agreed to form an Afri-
can American Studies department and com-
mitted to a goal of 10 percent Black student 

enrollment.

But civil rights activism is just one of 

many social issues that has brought stu-
dents at the University together in a campus 
tradition of fighting for progress and social 
change. Greene’s ability to command the 
attention of our campus to the Diag recalls 
the days a man named Alan Haber empow-
ered his peers to participate in strikes and 
protests on the very same Diag in protest of 
the Vietnam War. 

************
When Alan Haber arrived at the Uni-

versity in 1954, he didn’t look particularly 
different than the average freshman — 
hardworking and from a respected family. 
Haber’s father, William, was a renowned 
New Deal economist who served in the Roo-
sevelt administration, helping to establish 
the U.S. Social Security Administration. 
Later on, the elder Haber became a dean at 
the University and an eminent Economics 
professor.

By his own admission, Alan was not very 

politically engaged when he first stepped 
foot on campus, nor did he have big plans to 
study politics — instead, he intended to pur-
sue a degree in chemistry.

But within six years of his matriculation, 

Haber would lead one of the most conse-
quential student movements in American 
history.

In the decade following World War II, 

most Americans were content to return to 
the traditional social order of the pre-war 
era. Wartime “Rosies” left their jobs, which 
were then filled by men — many of whom 
returning veterans. African Americans, who 
were once able to carve economic niches 
for themselves in the defense industry — as 
a result of President Franklin Roosevelt’s 
Executive Order 8802 and the Fair Employ-
ment Practices Committee — were once 
again relegated to second-class economic 
status when attempts to permanently codify 
these groundbreaking laws were thwarted 
in 1946 by Southern segregationist Demo-
crats.

During the ’50s, America became fixated 

on the consumerism and traditional gender 
and race relations, as portrayed in works like 
“Catcher in the Rye.” Conformity was king — 
until it wasn’t.

Almost every facet of the 1960s youth 

counterculture was a wholesale rejection of 
their parents’ values from the ’50s, and there 
is almost no place where this was more on 
display than in Ann Arbor. On the Universi-
ty’s campus, a reimagining of leftist politics 

took place with the emergence of the “New 
Left.”

Austin McCoy, a postdoctoral fellow who 

studies progressive political movements in 
the upper Midwest, noted that the Univer-
sity’s campus climate at the time was ripe for 
political and social activism.

“Michigan, at the time, had a decent 

cohort of students who were thinking more 
radically in their politics and were capable 
of launching a student movement,” McCoy 
said. “They were thinking about the limita-
tions of the old left, of Communist politics 
and 
of 
organized 

labor.”

These limitations 

were 
particularly 

important on cam-
pus at the time, given 
the context of how 
entrenched 
liberal 

institutions were in 
state politics. If cars 
were king in Michi-
gan, 
labor 
unions 

were 
queen. 
And 

many of the early 
adherents 
to 
the 

“New Left” were the 
children of blue-col-
lar factory workers.

Haber’s 
political 

engagement 
began 

in the late ‘50s when 
he made friends his 
freshman year with 
a group of politically 
active students. He 
soonafter 
created 

the 
since-defunct 

Political Issues Club 
— then a forum for 
students to discuss 
political 
matters 

without 
attaching 

themselves to a polit-
ical party.

“Within a short 

time, 
my 
friends 

had said to me: ‘You know there’s no politi-
cal discussion on campus,’” Haber said. “So 
my friends told me that I should start a club 
that was focused on talking about political 
issues.”

By 1960, after a few years leading PIC, 

Haber became a well known student activ-
ist. Riding on his reputation, Haber was 
elected vice president of the Student League 
for Industrial Democracy — a national orga-

nization linking labor and socialist groups. 
Not long after his initial election to the board 
of SLID, Haber pushed for a change in name 
and strategy.

“I told them that I wouldn’t do it because 

SLID had definitely ‘slid,’” Haber said. “And 
if we were going to make a national student 
‘change the world’ organization, we had to 
be called something else. … And at that meet-
ing, we decided upon a new name — Students 
for a Democratic Society.”

SDS proliferated to campuses nationally 

by attracting a primarily northern, mostly 

white cohort interested in civil rights and 
anti-war politics. At the crux of the move-
ment was participatory democracy and 
advocacy for America’s youth. During the 
’60s, there was no singular issue that pre-
sented a greater threat to the youngest gen-
eration than the Vietnam War.

By 1962, SDS had grown to be influen-

tial in Ann Arbor and on dozens of other 
campuses around the country. Its leaders 

— many of whom were based at the Uni-
versity — concluded it was time to create a 
political manifesto that provided a synopsis 
of the organization’s official views. The Port 
Huron Statement — after which the Daily’s 
Statement magazine is named — became one 
of the seminal political documents of the era.

The Statement was primarily authored by 

Tom Hayden, a former Daily editor-in-chief 
and later national president of SDS.

The Port Huron Statement outlined a bold 

vision of leftist American politics for the 
1960s. In the document, Hayden highlights 
the key grievances of his generation: dissat-
isfaction with the Democratic Party’s inclu-
sion of southern segregationists, the Cold 
War arms race and a push for University 
reforms.

In the massive 25,700-word document, 

Hayden makes a direct appeal to college stu-
dents, convincing them of the urgency of his 
cause.

“As we grew, however, our comfort was 

penetrated by events too troubling to dis-
miss,” the statement reads. “First, the per-
meating and victimizing fact of human 
degradation, symbolized by the Southern 
struggle against racial bigotry, compelled 

most of us from silence to activism. Second, 
the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbol-
ized by the presence of the Bomb, brought 
awareness that we ourselves, and our 
friends, and millions of abstract ‘others’ we 
knew more directly because of our common 
peril, might die at any time. We might delib-
erately ignore, or avoid, or fail to feel all other 
human problems, but not these two, for these 
were too immediate and crushing in their 

impact, too challenging in the demand that 
we as individuals take the responsibility for 
encounter and resolution.”

McCoy said The Port Huron Statement 

was so prolific on campus because it spoke to 
such a large part of the student body.

“The Port Huron Statement seemed to tap 

into the discontent of mostly white, middle 
class students who wanted to think more rad-
ically about changing their society,” McCoy 
said. “Students were distributing it and shar-
ing it hand to hand. And when I think about 
the intellectual history of the ‘New Left’ … it 
really became the most important document 
because it was written by a group of students 
and activists who were intentional about try-
ing to create a new form of politics.”

The SDS’s strategy was to incorporate 

their broader national political goals into 
localized action directed primarily at uni-
versity administrators across the country.

In the 1960s, when the federal govern-

ment announced that eligible students could 
only obtain draft deferments if they were 
in the top half of their class, the SDS at the 
University responded with protest, pressur-
ing the University not to hand over academic 
records.

“We got together to have a student refer-

endum about whether we should push the 
University to abandon its practice of calcu-
lating class rank so it could not comply with 
the order,” Haber said. “Not only did the 
University not want to hear about this, but 
we also learned that the administration was 
turning over the names of student activists 
to the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities.”

In addition to organizing Vietnam War 

protests, SDS also engaged in the civil rights 
battles which shaped the ’60s — promoting 
racial and gender equality and calling for 
an end to the overbearing paternalism of 
the University’s administration toward the 
student body. Known as in loco parentis, 
the prevailing philosophy among academic 
administrators at the time saw themselves as 
responsible for the moral welfare of students 
in the absence of parental supervision. This 
included a prohibition on political speech 
deemed antithetical to the mainstream val-
ues of the University, and — consequently 
— expellingstudents without due process. 
After a riot in front of the police department 
on February 18, 1970, over 100 students were 
expelled for protesting.

By the mid ’60s, the Vietnam War escalat-

ed and SDS grew in membership on campus, 
professors began to take action. On March 
24, 1965, a group of professors held the first 
campus “teach-in” — an all-night lecture 
that covered the topic of “alternative posi-
tions to present American foreign policy.”

“The Vietnam War was a very real threat 

for students on campus, and it seemed to 
many of these activists that the University 

was implicated in the war through research 
and development which fed into the military-
industrial complex,” McCoy said. “There 
really didn’t seem to be a space for students 
and faculty to have a real conversation about 
this until the teach-ins.”

McCoy described the all-night teach-ins as 

a compromise: The University did not want 
its professors devoting time and resources 
during the day to educate protesters.

The teach-in movement that began at the 

University would later expand to campuses 
across the country and become one of the 
most powerful weapons in the anti-war 
movement — 35 other colleges held their 
own teach-ins within a week. As the national 
political environment became polarized 
over the war, campus politics followed suit.

On October 15, 1965, 39 protesters, many 

of whom were University students, werear-
rested during a mass demonstration against 
the Vietnam War draft for trespassing and 
civil disobedience. The same night, students 
and community activists staged an eight-
hour Diag vigil.

Counter-protesters at each event came 

out in force. Some destroyed a student float 
at the demonstration depicting abuse within 
American POW camps and heckled arrest-
ed activists. Right-wing organizations like 
the Young Americans for Freedom, saw an 
increase in membership on campus as right-
leaning students developed nascent fears 
of Communist sympathies within student 
groups like SDS.

YAF’s sense of political urgency to resist 

leftist student movements only intensified as 
more radical break-away groups split from 
SDS. One such group, The Weather Under-
ground — started at the University by then-
student Bill Ayers — engaged in a domestic 
terrorism campaign that included a string of 
bombings in government buildings.

According to Grant Strobl, LSA senior 

and current National Chair of the Young 
Americans for Freedom, the right-wing 
organization’s growth was a response to the 
increasing radicalization of leftist splinter 
groups.

“SDS and the rise of The Weather Under-

ground were different from previous protest 
movements because they used violence and 
they used domestic terrorism to advance 
their ideas,” Strobl said.

YAF members on campus saw themselves 

in a unique position during the waning years 
of the 1960s — a political minority on cam-
pus, yet upholding the mainstream political 
values of former President Richard Nixon’s 
“silent majority.”

On the national scale, the tenuous coali-

tion of labor Democrats, younger radicals 
and later, Black nationalists would disinte-
grate due to internal divisions by the end of 
the 1960s — as was on full display during the 
violent clashes outside the 1968 Democratic 
National Convention.

Riding on a “Law and Order” platform 

that played on a distaste for political unrest, 
Richard Nixon narrowly beat Democrat 
Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and won re-elec-
tion in an electoral landslide against George 
McGovern — the Democratic candidate most 
aligned with the “New Left” — in what was 
arguably a repudiation of their politics by a 
silent majority.

While the “New Left” continued to define 

much of campus activism into the 1970s, the 
fractious coalition could exercise little power 
in electoral politics and remained tethered to 
its roots in the ivory tower.

6B

By the 1970s, Black nationalism emerged 

as a salient force in campus activism at the 
University as liberal leaders and students of 
color became increasingly jaded by the Civil 
Rights Movement’s painfully slow pace.

The 1968 LSA building sit-in following 

King’s assassination proved to be a power-
ful model for civil rights groups on campus 
because it proved the potential of direct 
action to attract public attention.

The sit-in proved students on campus 

could engage in successful negotiation with 
the University and leverage institutional 
change. It also foreshadowed activism in 
the 1970s, which looked to this event as an 
example for future organizing efforts.

While the BSU was able to win key con-

cessions in the years that followed the his-
toric sit-in, some demands were not met, 
such as calls for hiring more Black faculty. 
As a result, the University saw an increase 
in civil rights activism.

In 1970, the BSU, Black Law Students 

Association, Association of Black Social 
Work Students and Black students in the 
Psychology 
Department 
and 
Medical 

School launched a campus-wide strike, 
dubbed the Black Action Movement.

A statement issued by BAM outlined 

the movement’s demands, including an 
increase in Black graduate and undergradu-
ate recruiters and a call for 10 percent Black 
student enrollment by the 1973-1974 aca-
demic year.

“BAM was a response to the fact that 

Black students did not believe that the 
administration had taken the demands of 
the (1968) lock-in seriously,” McCoy said. 
“So some of the students, while in a meeting 
with the administration became fed up with 
the conversation and these students decide 
to not go to class and instead to go on strike.”

BAM’s successful disruption decreased 

class attendance by 75 percent and closed 
the University for 18 days. In the end, Flem-
ing agreed to the 10 percent Black student 
enrollment goal, which the University failed 
to achieve. This move drew sharp criti-
cismfrom then-U.S. Vice President Spiro 
Agnew, who insinuated the University 
would gut its admissions standards in doing 
so.

A second iteration of BAM — dubbed 

BAM II — sprouted in 1975 when the Uni-
versity failed to uphold its promises from 
five years prior but quickly fizzled out after 
issuing a lengthy list of demands. Calls for 
10 percent Black enrollment again failed.

For the most part, the spirit of BAM 

and BAM II were not recaptured until 
1987 when students from United Coalition 
Against Racism — an organization founded 
initially to fight for University divestment 
from the apartheid state of South Africa 
— organized BAM III in response to racist 
incidents in residence halls and a controver-
sy in which a campus DJ for then-campus 
radio station WJJX broadcasted obscene 

racist statements on air.

UCAR leaders then presented a list of 11 

demands to then-University President Har-
old Shapiro. When they weren’t accepted, 
BAM III staged a sit-in attended by over 250 
students.

Following talks between Shapiro and 

UCAR leaders, the University agreed to sev-
eral of BAM III’s policy positions — includ-
ing the recognition of Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day, the announcement of a six-point 
plan to increase Black student enrollment, 
the installation of a vice provost for minor-
ity affairs, a budget for BSU and an updated 
procedure for incidents of racial harass-
ment. Also included in the University’s deal 
with UCAR were plans to break ground on 
the now-defunct Baker-Mandela Center for 
Anti-Racist Education.

To McCoy, BAM III signified one of the 

last times on campus when a united front of 
Black student activists and their allies were 
able to extract major concessions from the 
administration.

“BAM III was very consequential for 

influencing campus politics but then also 
for helping to diversify the University by 
pushing the President to do something 
more specific, like increasing Black enroll-
ment and minority enrollment in general 
and hiring more minority faculty.”

************
The mixed successes of each BAM move-

ment ushered in a new era of progress at the 
University — one in which Black students 
were more empowered to take direct action 
against the institution to correct historic 
injustices and help improve students’ sense 
of security on campus.

In 1988, former University President 

James Duderstadt sought a solution to the 
years of tension over low minority enroll-
ment. His solution was The Michigan Man-
date, which increased representation of 
minority populations in the student body 
and among faculty members. The plan more 
than doubled enrolled minority students 
from 1986 to 1995.

At its peak, the Black student population 

approached 9 percent in 1994. At the time, 
student activist groups saw The Michigan 
Mandate as the fulfillment of BAM I, II and 
III’s loftiest goals.

Following 
Duderstadt’s 
resignation 

as University president in 1996, the U.S. 
Supreme Court invalidated the University’s 
affirmative action policy in 2003 in Gratz 
v. Bollinger. In the landmark case, Jenni-
fer Gratz claimed the method by which the 
University administered affirmative action 
policies was unconstitutional because it 
gave an unfair advantage to minority appli-
cants. 

While the case did not prohibit the Uni-

versity entirely from using race-based affir-
mative action in admissions decisions, the 
decision weakened the University’s pre-
ferred methods of attaining a critical mass 
of minority students in each freshman class.

It was not until 2006, when a statewide 

ballot referendum, Proposition 2, prohibit-
ed public universities in Michigan from tak-

ing race into consideration for admission. 
Ever since, the percentage of Black students 
on campus has declined, and later stalled at 
about 4 to 5 percent.

Even today, the issue of affirmative 

action remains a contentious issue on cam-
pus. Some conservative student leaders, like 
Strobl, feel the ballot initiative removes any 
unfair advantages in the already-cutthroat 
admissions process.

“YAF has always been against racial pref-

erences — we don’t call it affirmative action 
because it is not true to its word, it does 
nothing affirmative,” Strobl said. “We have 
always believed that it is more important to 
judge a man by his talent and his hard work 
and you should not see color first.”

It is clear that Proposition 2 was a major 

setback for those advocating an increase 
in Black student enrollment; however, not 
all proponents of affirmative action admis-
sions policies feel it can fully account for 
the nearly 5-percent decline in Black enroll-
ment from its peak in 1994.

“Part of the goal of student activism 

should be to combat the narrative that the 
administration is pushing that the reason 
they can’t do anything about enrollment fig-
ures is because of Prop. 2,” McCoy said. “It 
is important to hold the University account-
able for their role too.”

************
The student activist movement familiar 

to many current students, faculty and Uni-
versity administrators was born in 2013 
when the BSU coined the popular phrase 
Being Black at the University of Michigan 
via the #BBUM hashtag on Twitter.

The hashtag quickly became a public 

forum for Black students at the University 
to share their experiences with implicit 
racial microaggressions, encounters with 
hate messages, racially-motivated verbal 
assaults and the pressures of often being the 
only Black student in class.

Former student Jeremy Cook tweeted on 

November 19, 2013, shortly after the coining 
of the #BBUM hashtag, his frustration with 
tokenization.

“That first class when Black culture 

becomes the topic and you suddenly become 
the voice of all Black people #BBUM,” Cook 
tweeted.

Other Black students shared stories about 

peers assuming they were from Detroit sim-
ply because of their racial identity.

Once again, the spirit of BAM was recap-

tured. The BSU gained a national audience 
and sought to seize the political moment.

In a 2015 interview, former BSU trea-

surer Robert Greenfield spoke about repeat-
edly pushing, albeit unsuccessfully, for the 
demands made by BAM years earlier.

“Once we gained national attention, we 

(had) leverage to go back to the U of M black 
community and ask what they wanted to 
have done/fixed,” Greenfield wrote. “Many 
of the demands are lasting agreements that 
the University never came through on (but 
agreed to) — this included the 10 percent 
critical mass of black students on campus.”

It is yet to be seen whether #BBUM had 

success in swaying the administration. In 
2016, Schlissel unveiled the University’s 
new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strate-
gic plan to address student concerns about 
racial inequality and enrollment. But many 
feel the plan isn’t robust enough to boost 
minority enrollment to the same degree as 
The Michigan Mandate, and is inadequate 
as a response to racist and hate-based inci-
dents on campus.

The last academic year alone saw a num-

ber of hate-speech incidents, including 
anti-Black fliers posted on University prop-
erty and hacking of a University profes-
sor’s email to send anti-Semitic messages 
to students. This comes at a time when 
hate crimes are also on the rise nation-
ally; according to a recent Huffington Post 
report, between 2015 and 2016, the number 
of documented hate crimes increased by 
about 5 percent.

Many students simply do not feel the Uni-

versity is doing enough to create a safe envi-
ronment for everyone.

“We want actual action,” LSA senior Jen-

ise Williams said last February after the 
anti-Semitic and racist emails were sent. 
“My parents were here 30 years ago fight-
ing for the same things … and (now) I didn’t 
want my sister to come here because of the 
shit I deal with here.”

To McCoy, the concern students feel 

regarding the administration goes straight 
to the top.

“From my personal experiences, people 

of color on campus don’t have any confi-
dence in President Schlissel,” McCoy said. 
“Whenever there are concerns about their 
safety or about racism, he seems to kick the 
question back to (the protesters), and he 
often asks, ‘Well what would you want us 
to do about this?’ And this could be an hon-
est reaction where he just doesn’t know, so 
that doesn’t inspire any confidence. Or the 
cynical view is that it could be a deflection. 
… And I don’t know if either one is better.”

************
Last week’s racist vandalism in West 

Quad cannot be viewed in isolation. Years of 
student grievances and racially-motivated 
incidents led Greene to take a knee on the 
Diag Monday morning.

As of fall 2016, Black student enrollment 

at the University stood at 4.94 percent — a 
far cry from the 10 percent demanded by 
each iteration of BAM, and a significant 
decline from the 1994 enrollment figures.

No one has been implicated for the rac-

ist flyering, rock painting, email hacking or 
door tag defacing, either.

The past six decades of the University’s 

protest culture and campus climate have 
led us to this point. SDS, BAM, UCAR and 
now #BBUM gave and give a public voice for 
liberal student activism — each generation 
passing the baton of social justice on to the 
next.

This is a powerful political moment on 

campus, but it is not unique. The student 
body and administration have both been 
here before. The only question that remains: 
Where will they go from here?

ast week, just in time for the Jew-

it was the minute I got it. Inside the box was 
a mound bundled in tinfoil and bubble wrap 
and cellophane, tied with a ribbon. “For a 
sweet New Year!” was written on a tag — 
referring to Rosh Hashanah, the holiday that 
signifies the beginning of a new year in the 
Jewish religion. After careful inspection, I 
opened the cellophane and tore through the 
tinfoil, instantly getting crumbs and cinna-
mon and sugar all over my shirt. My excited 
sneaking suspicion was correct: My mom sent 
me a package of her famous mandelbrot.

Mandelbrot is a cookie popular among 

Eastern European Jews, liter-
ally meaning “almond bread” 
in Yiddish. Cut from a loaf 
into one-inch slices and baked 
twice, the delicate treat can be 
mistaken for biscotti’s softer 
first cousin or the chocolate 
chip cookies’ thinner — and 
somewhat frailer — uncle, but 
one bite proves otherwise.

Every time I hear those 

three syllables, my ears perk 
up, my mouth begins to water 
and I mentally prepare myself 
to delve into a delicious piece 
of 
my 
great-grandmother’s 

mandelbrot recipe. The aroma 
produces a visceral reaction, 
a Pavlovian response. I know 
I’m about to enjoy a welcoming 
mouthful of chocolate, cinna-
mon and sugar.

***
Our family’s mandelbrot — 

“or ‘mandelbread’ as the gen-
tiles would call it,” my grandma 
would interject — dates all the 
way back to the early 1900s. I 
say it’s my great-grandmother’s 
recipe, but her neighbor, Mrs. 
Wertheim, was the true cre-
ator of this particular combina-
tion. In what has been retold to 
seem like a covert operation, my 
mom had to coerce Mrs. Wert-
heim’s niece to sneak her the 
top-secret recipe when her aunt 
wasn’t looking.

We still give Mrs. Wertheim 

credit, but ever since that recipe 
handoff more than 25 years ago, 
the mandelbrot recipe has been 
altered a bit, thus becoming the 
nucleus of the Katz household. 
Hosting the Katz’s for Rosh 
Hashanah dinner? Get out a 

tray for their delicious mandelbrot. Going 
over to the Katz’s house for Passover? Get 
ready for their amazing Passover mandelbrot, 
a different — yet just as tasty — recipe, made 
without flour and replaced with matzah meal. 
Sometimes I feel like our dessert gets us the 
invites.

Much of Jewish culture is centered around 

food, as is the case with many different eth-
nicities. The laughable, yet accurate, remark I 
hear all the time from my relatives that sum-
marizes every Jewish holiday is “They tried 
to kill us, we won, let’s eat!” Food is a major 
part of our cultural identity — pastrami and 
corned beef on rye with a cup of matzah ball 
soup is a mantra I live by — and my family’s 
mandelbrot recipe perfectly describes this 

importance.

The word mandelbrot doesn’t just mean I’m 

about to eat my favorite sweet; that’s not what 
it truly represents. The tradition of a family 
recipe links the generations while facilitating 
the creation of new memories. This heavenly 
loaf has the power to bring together a family 
and sometimes an entire community together 
in times of happiness and sadness.

Along with joyous occasions like holidays 

and birthdays, mandelbrot can also serve as 
a form of solace for those grieving. A staple in 
Jewish culture, the dessert infuses an inex-
plicable sense of comfort. Our family’s go-to 
dish to bring to a shiva — a weeklong grieving 
period in Judaism — is mandelbrot, for good 
reason. The crunchy bite doesn’t just give off 

a homey feeling, but it also provides one of 
comfort, a sort of distraction from pain.

Yes, I am biased, but I truly believe my 

mom makes the best mandelbrot in the 
world. Although a somewhat simple recipe 
of eight ingredients, for some unknown rea-
son, friends who have attempted it have been 
unable to deliver.

***
My mom used to tell me a man who knows 

how to cook or bake will always make his 
wife very happy. I immediately became her 
permanent sous chef. Looking back, that was 
probably just a ploy to get me to help make 
dinner — or maybe to spend quality time with 
her oldest child.

Ever since I can remember, I have helped 

my mother finish off the loaves 
with a dusting of cinnamon 
and sugar. Now I know the 
recipe by heart, perfecting 
the 
chocolate-chip-to-batter 

ratio. With this comes a great 
responsibility 
to 
continue 

passing on the joy of this man-
delbrot recipe to future gen-
erations — the common theme 
in Judaism of l’dor v’dor, 
“from generation to genera-
tion” in Hebrew — and doing 
so all the while touching oth-
ers with this taste of family.

It may seem cliche, but 

even though I’m 511 miles 
away from home, this des-
sert makes me feel like I’m 
still just a boy sneaking a taste 
after helping his mom with 
the cinnamon and sugar dust-
ing. For a split second when I 
ripped through the tinfoil and 
started to pick at the man-
delbrot, I wasn’t in my dorm 
room, but rather at home eat-
ing the treat that makes my 
ears perk up and my mouth 
begin to water.

For that one moment, as I 

ate the first piece of mandel-
brot, I felt a sense of love and 
security, protecting me from 
the outside and the stresses 
of college. I’m reminded of my 
culture, of home.

Mandelbrot is so much 

more than food to me. It repre-
sents a special bond between a 
mother and her son. It repre-
sents a cultural identity being 
passed down for generations. 
It represents celebrating the 
happy times and mourning the 
sad ones.

On Friday, September 15th, I headed to the Diag to photograph my friends’ band, 
Shmongo, at an event hosted by Stamp Nation, a student organization devoted 
to student musicians. Shmongo is composed of five students in the school of 
Music, Theatre & Dance: Geoff Brown, Aaron Willette, Jacob Suagrman, Ryan 
Cox and Joey Fortino. Having a large DSLR camera in my hands didn’t stop me 
from dancing to the music. It is almost impossible not to have a great time at a 
Shmongo concert because the band never fails to create a special experience for 

its audience.

first song of the night.
