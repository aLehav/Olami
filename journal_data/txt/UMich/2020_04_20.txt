Since the University of Michigan 

moved classes online March 11, both 

students and professors have had to adjust. 

For professors with families, teaching 

classes 
virtually 
and 
maintaining 

research projects has created unique 

and unprecedented situations when 

combined with childcare.

Meghan Duffy, a professor in the 

Department of Ecology and Evolutionary 

Biology who has three children under 

the age of 10, explained that the COVID-

19 outbreak and stay-at-home orders 

will affect all individuals and families 

uniquely. She said having children at 

home is one factor that impacts the 

experience immensely. 

“One thing that will be a huge factor 

in terms of how people experience this 

is whether they had kids at home, and 

there’s certainly a lot of variation within 

that,” Duffy said. 

Duffy elaborated on the variety in the 

work and home lives of professionals with 

families, which are now overlapping. She 

said in her current working and living 

situation distinct work hours are hard to 

come by. 

“There are people who are home with 

kids who are functioning more or less as 

they normally would in terms of their 

ability to get work done,” Duffy said. 

“There are some people who are getting 

nothing done and there’s a lot of variation. 

I do think having young kids at home, it 

just really limits the number of work 

hours I have in a day.”

Allison Riccardi, professor of Spanish, 

is teaching her classes from home with 

three young children also at home all 

day since daycare services and primary 

schools have closed as of March 12. She 

said the initial transition period to online 

classes was strenuous, noting how taking 

care of her family while maintaining a 

full curriculum online can add stress.

“It was challenging getting everything 

set up in just the two days that we had, 

and then having the kids at home is just 

an extra challenge,” Riccardi said. “It’s 

hard for them to understand that now I’m 

working and I can’t take care of you right 

now.”

Riccardi said this unique situation has 

both pros and cons. 

“Just like anything, there are benefits 

and drawbacks,” Riccardi said. “So the 

benefit is, of course, more family time. 

The drawback would be sometimes when 

I’m in class they’ll just barge in and that’s 

a big interruption.”

For some people, social distancing and 

working from home with a family has 

revealed the importance of downtime. 

Duffy highlighted her own experience 

with this, saying she finds herself with 

reduced working hours. 

“We’ve now worked out a system 

where if I’m ultra-focused during all of 

the child-free hours I have in a day, it’s 

five hours, so I have to be ultra-focused 

in that but also there’s no other down 

time,” Duffy said. “I didn’t realize how 

much biking to campus was really useful 

for getting the little time mentally to be 

thinking of nothing.”

On April 1 and 2, LSA students 

voted between two tickets for LSA 

Student Government president and 

vice president: one with juniors Jordan 

Schuler and Sai Pamidighantam and 

the other with juniors Selena Bazzi and 

Josiah Walker. Two weeks later, the 

results of the election have not been 

certified and a winning ticket has not 

been announced.

Bazzi and Walker won the election 

with 437 votes, 132 more than Schuler 

and Pamidighantam, according to a 

copy of the uncertified results shared 

with 
The 
Daily 
by 
co-Elections 

Director Tyler Ziel, an LSA senior. But 

a Central Student Judiciary appeal filed 

by Schuler over messages Bazzi sent in 

two GroupMe chats could lead to her 

ticket’s disqualification. 

 LSA SG bylaws forbid campaigning 

during the voting period. Schuler and 

Pamidighantam have accused Bazzi of 

doing so on social media and demand 

her ticket’s disqualification. Bazzi and 

Walker say the social media posts in 

question were intended to increase 

voter turnout and cannot be considered 

campaigning. They add that Schuler 

and Pamidighantam made social media 

posts during the voting period that 

could be considered campaigning, but 

Bazzi and Walker didn’t report them 

because they did not want demerits to 

impact the outcome of the election. 

Demerits are issued to candidates 

when they are found to have violated 

the Elections Code. A single demerit 

knocks 3 percent off a ticket’s votes, 

and four or more demerits disqualify a 

candidate from the election.

Election rules, specifically those 

related to online campaigning, are 

unclear and election directors have 

broad discretion to interpret them, 

co-Elections Director Natalie Suh, an 

LSA sophomore, said. The elections 

directors ruled that Bazzi’s posts 

constitute implicit rather than explicit 

campaigning 
and 
thus 
reduced 

her ticket’s votes by 6 percent, 3 

percent for each demerit, instead of 

disqualifying her and Walker. Schuler 

and Pamidighantam argued this is an 

unfair application of the rules based on 

precedent and that Bazzi and Walker 

should be disqualified.

CAMPUS LIFE

In light of the coronavirus 

outbreak, University of Michigan 

summer 
student 
orientation, 

which is mandatory for all first-

year and transfer students, is 

moving online. 

As orientation is a chance to visit 

campus and meet other students 

before classes start, the switch 

to online orientation will affect 

the ability of students to do so. 

Incoming freshman Anagha Kodur 

said she was already concerned her 

introverted nature would make 

the transition difficult. With an 

online orientation, she’s worried 

it’ll be even more challenging.

last Friday evening.
With Sanders out, students 
hesitate to support Joe Biden

Progressive organizations on campus uncertain whether to back 
moderate candidate after liberal senator suspends his campaign

When 
Vermont 
Sen. 
Bernie 

Sanders, I-Vt., ended his presidential 

campaign earlier this month, former 

Vice President Joe Biden became the 

presumptive 
Democratic 
nominee. 

Sanders, a longtime liberal firebrand, 

subsequently endorsed Biden, who 

had pitched himself as the moderate 

and reliable option throughout the 

primary. With the field of Democratic 

candidates narrowed down to one, 

some 
progressive 
students 
aren’t 

thrilled with the choice before them.

On college campuses across the 

country, student groups formed to 

support 
Sanders 
expressed 
their 

discontent on social media, refusing to 

endorse Biden. 

In interviews with The Daily, various 

University of Michigan students said 

they were disappointed and unsure 

whether to back Biden in the general 

election come November.

LSA junior Arden Shapiro, campus 

corps leader for Students for Bernie, 

said Sanders’s decision to exit the 

race 
was 
disheartening 
but 
said 

she understood why he ended the 

campaign.

“Honestly, it did come as kind of a 

surprise and it was a bit disappointing,” 

Shapiro said. “However, I trust that he 

made the best decision for himself and 

his constituents and his movement, 

given the current circumstances we’re 

in and his desire to defeat (President) 

Donald Trump in the general election.” 

The official account for Students 

for Bernie at UMich tweeted they are 

not endorsing or supporting Biden, 

breaking with Sanders himself. 

In an April 8 video announcing the 

end of his presidential bid, Sanders 

emphasized the importance of getting 

Biden elected and beating Trump in the 

general election.

“Then together, standing united, 

we will go forward to defeat Donald 

Trump, the most dangerous president 

in modern American history,” Sanders 

said. “As I hope all of you know, this 

race has never been about me.” 

Shapiro commented on the tweet, 

explaining they do not believe Biden’s 

policies are progressive enough to earn 

their endorsement. 

“Even 
though 
Senator 
Sanders 

himself 
did 
endorse 
the 
former 

vice 
president, 
speaking 
as 
kind 

of 
a 
leadership 
cohort 
together 

and reflecting on the values of our 

organization and our goals, we decided 

that at this time, it would not be possible 

for us to endorse Joe Biden,” Shapiro 

said. “We do not believe his platform 

adequately addresses the issues that 

this country is currently facing and will 

certainly be facing in the future in light 

of the current economic depression. We 

don’t believe that his stance on climate 

appreciates the dire reality of climate 

change that we will be experiencing 

within the next decade.”

Not all students were jarred by 

Sanders’s decision. Engineering junior 

Omar Al-Ejel supported Sanders in the 

primary and said he was not surprised 

when the campaign ended. Al-Ejel said 

Biden benefited institutional support 

as he continued winning primary 

delegates, 
primarily 
among 
the 

Democratic National Committee and 

fellow presidential challengers former 

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg 

and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., 

both of whom endorsed Biden after 

suspending their own campaigns.

“I wasn’t surprised at that point 

since I knew what was coming after 

the whole media and DNC pile-on 

against Bernie started to manifest in 

Biden shooting up in the polls and him 

winning states,” Al-Ejel said. 

LSA sophomore Eman Naga was 

also a Sanders supporter. She said she 

wasn’t surprised either.

“I expected it, but that didn’t 

make it hurt any less,” Naga said. “I 

think I internally placed too great an 

emphasis on electoral politics and 

viewed Sanders as a political savior 

which wasn’t fair, but his campaign 

undoubtedly paved the path forward 

and it’s up to his supporters to walk it.” 

In an interview with The Daily prior 

to a rally on The Diag on March 8, 

Sanders emphasized the success of his 

campaign in shaping the Democratic 

Party’s ideology through grassroots 

organizing. He also addressed the 

difficulty of getting younger voters to 

show up at the polls.

“Younger people are in fact the 

most progressive young generation 

in the history of this country, that’s 

your generation,” Sander said. “The 

problem is that it has historically been 

very hard to get young people to vote 

in large numbers. We’re making some 

progress.”

Drumming 
up 
support 
among 

young voters was key to Sanders’s 

electoral strategy, which ultimately 

fell flat when Biden won the Michigan 

primary, a state that was integral to 

Sanders’s campaign in 2016. 

In the March interview, Sanders 

emphasized the importance of students 

participating in electoral politics.

“That’s why we’re here on the 

campus, that’s why we visit many 

campuses: to make it clear to young 

people that in a democracy they have 

an obligation to participate, that it’s 

not good enough to moan and groan 

about all the concerns you have, you’ve 

got to get involved and stand up for 

what you believe in, and that means 

participating in the political progress,” 

Sanders said.

Despite efforts from the Sanders 

camp 
to 
increase 
voter 
turnout 

among students, Biden swept every 

county in the state, including left-

leaning Washtenaw, the home of the 

University’s flagship campus and the 

site of a get-out-the-vote rally with 

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 

D-N.Y., that drew more than 10,000 

attendees. 

Shapiro said that, though Students 

for Bernie are not endorsing Biden, 

they understand many Democrats feel 

that Sanders supporters should vote 

for Biden in hopes of beating Trump.

The question of who will lead 

LSA SG comes down to code 

technicalities and a few social media 

posts. But for the four candidates 

awaiting the CSJ’s decision, they 

said in documents and interviews 

that the decision raises larger 

questions about power, politics, 

equal application of rules and free 

speech on campus. 

Who posted what and when? 

Forty minutes after the polls 

opened April 1, Bazzi sent two 

identical GroupMe messages in 

two separate chats: one contained 

members of the Central Student 

Government’s 
Seventh 
Assembly 

and the other included members of 

her first-year hall council, though 

Bazzi noted only four to five voters 

were in each group. 

Bazzi sent the message “POLLS 

ARE OPEN, PLEASE VOTE ! I 

am running for President :). Vote.

umich.edu.” on Wednesday, April 1. 

Whether or not the posts’ 10 words 

constitute explicit campaigning — 

during a period where campaigning 

is 
strictly 
prohibited 
— 
could 

disqualify her and Walker, changing 

the outcome of the election. 

Ziel and Suh issued two demerits 

to Bazzi and Walker after Schuler 

and 
Pamidighantam 
reported 

Bazzi’s posts following the end of the 

official campaigning period. Schuler 

and Pamidighantam declined to 

comment for this story due to the 

ongoing 
investigation 
into 
the 

election’s results. 

Demerits can be issued to both 

students in LSA SG who are not 

running and candidates. Election-

related demerits handed to non-

candidates do not impact the race, 

but are issued to note wrongdoing. 

In an interview with The Daily, 

Bazzi pointed to the fact that her 

opponent, Pamidighantam, was in 

the CSG Assembly chat and that 

Pamidighantam 
and 
Schuler’s 

campaign manager was in the dorm 

chat as proof her messages weren’t 

intended to campaign. 

“I wouldn’t want to put (Sai) in an 

awkward position or myself,” Bazzi 

said. “I guess you could say that it’s 

support to my point that my intention 

is just to get people to vote. I’m not 

going to actively campaign in a chat 

that my opponent is in. I understand 

that it’s important to respect other 

people’s opinions, I feel like that 

would be crossing a line so I never 

intentionally tried to do that.”

Bazzi and Walker also stressed 

the limited reach of the messages. 

Bazzi noted only four to five eligible 

voters were in each of the group 

chats, rendering the impact minor in 

an election of more than 700 votes.

Schuler 
and 
Pamidighantam 

both posted on Facebook during 

the voting period in a public group 

named “Vote Jordan & Sai for LSA 

SG President and Vice President!” 

Right after midnight on April 1, 

Schuler posted: “Voting is officially 

open! Please go vote at vote.umich.

edu! :)” The next day, Schuler and 

Pamidighantam commented thanks 

under a post endorsing the pair. 

Bazzi and Walker claimed to have 

seen Schuler and Pamidighantam’s 

posts, 
which 
they 
said 
would 

also warrant demerits, but did 

not report them to the elections 

directors because they did not 

want to potentially disqualify their 

opponents. 

The elections directors’ demerit 

report is supposed to be confidential, 

though a copy was obtained by The 

Daily, as were two briefs submitted 

by third parties to the CSJ and the 

elections directors’ demerit report on 

Bazzi’s post.

The question is not if the voting 

period regulations — which are 

only in place during the time frame 

in which students can vote — were 

violated. The elections directors 

ruled that they were. The question 

lies in the extent to which the ticket 

found in violation of the regulations 

should be punished.

The demerit report

Ziel and Suh ruled in a demerit 

report that each GroupMe message 

constituted 
a 
one-point 
minor 

violation of the election code, totaling 

two demerits –– a 6-percent vote 

reduction for Bazzi and Walker.

The report acknowledges Bazzi’s 

posts to be major violations of 

the 
rule 
against 
“campaigning 

during the voting period.” Each 

candidate received an email before 

the no-campaigning period began, 

reiterating the rules and, according 

to the demerit report, each candidate 

“signed a contract waiving their 

ability to promote themselves during 

the voting period.”

A major violation would constitute 

three demerits, so a major violation 

for each of the two posts would 

have put Bazzi and Walker over 

the four demerit threshold for 

disqualification.

However, 
LSA 
SG 
bylaws 

encourage leniency in application of 

the laws and stress that they are not 

intended to disqualify candidates. 

In the demerit report, the elections 

directors noted a distinction between 

explicit campaigning, directly calling 

for people to vote for a candidate, and 

implicit campaigning, implying that 

people should vote for a candidate. 

Though the difference is not stated 

verbatim in the LSA code, the 

elections directors interpreted that 

the former would be a major violation 

worth three demerits, while the latter 

would constitute a minor violation 

worth one point. 

“It is clear that Selena was 

implying for the members of the two 

GroupMe chats to vote for her, but 

as it was disseminating the voting 

website to encourage a higher voter 

turnout and not her asking the 

members(s) to directly vote for her, it 

was not her explicitly campaigning, 

and interpretations of the rules must 

be construed liberally in favor of free 

and open communication,” the report 

reads. 

Because of this, the elections 

directors slashed the demerits from a 

total of six to two.

“To issue a major violation demerit 

for this would be too draconian for 

the decree of the violation,” the 

report reads. 

In an email to The Daily, Suh said 

she saw merit in the argument that 

Bazzi and Walker were not fairly 

penalized. Though she wrote the 

report with Ziel, she said she found 

issue with the ruling.

“I do believe there is merit to 

the accusations saying that Selena 

Bazzi’s violations were underplayed 

especially if we consider some of 

the other demerits handed out,” Suh 

wrote.

‘The full six demerits’: the 

appeal’s argument 

Under LSA SG’s bylaws, CSJ 

can interpret election rules if need 

be. Schuler and Pamidighantam 

filed an appeal to the Central 

Student Judiciary April 10 against 

the elections directors’ decision 

to minimize Bazzi and Walker’s 

demerits. The appeal called for CSJ 

to overturn the elections directors’ 

ruling and penalize Bazzi and Walker 

with the six demerits that would 

accompany two major violations 

instead of the two minor violations 

they were initially given. 

The appeal argued that as soon as 

a candidate, in this case Bazzi herself, 

was mentioned in the GroupMe 

posts, it became explicit rather 

than implicit campaigning because 

the bylaws “expressly prohibit any 

mention of a particular candidate in 

a message disseminated during the 

voting period.” 

The appeal said the elections 

directors ruled in another demerit 

report for this election cycle — 

using the same rules as Bazzi’s post 

violated — that a social media post 

made by a student not running in this 

election that explicitly mentioned a 

candidate during the voting period 

constituted a major violation. The 

student who posted it was issued 

three demerits. 

Though only the person who 

posted was issued the demerits 

— which would have no effect as 

demerits only impact candidates 

— the appeal argued that this 

application of what constitutes a 

major violation should also be used 

for Bazzi’s post.

The 
appeal 
highlighted 
the 

discrepancy between the elections 

directors’ ruling for Bazzi’s posts 

and the unnamed student’s post as 

an unfair application of the bylaws. 

In an interview with The Daily, 

Walker said the content of the appeal 

violates LSA SG’s constitution and 

CSJ’s purpose. He compared the CSJ 

overruling the elections director to 

the Supreme Court overruling a law 

because the justices personally don’t 

approve of it.

“The Central Student Judiciary 

can’t overrule the elections directors 

simply 
because 
they 
disagree 

with his reasoning,” Walker said. 

“The Supreme Court can overrule 

someone’s decision if that decision 

was unconstitutional, but if the 

decision is constitutional, and the 

elections director’s decision was 

constitutional, it can’t be overruled 

simply because the Supreme Court 

doesn’t like it.”

The 
Facebook 
comments: 

implicit or explicit campaigning? 

There were no demerits issued for 

any posts made by Pamidighantam 

and Schuler made in the “Vote Jordan 

& Sai for LSA SG President and Vice 

President!” Facebook group during 

the voting period. But according 

to an amicus curiae submitted to 

CSJ by LSA sophomore Tyler Watt 

and LSA junior Chayton Fivecoat in 

support of the elections directors’ 

original decision, the actions at the 

heart of the case committed by Bazzi 

were “committed in equal measure” 

by Schuler and Pamidighantam in 

that Facebook group. 

“A candidate posting in a Facebook 

group with dozens of members who 

are eligible to vote in the election 

campaigns explicitly for themself; 

the fact that their name and that of 

their running mate appear in the 

masthead of the event certainly 

create an even stronger suggestion 

for people to vote for that specific 

ticket,” Watt and Fivecoat wrote in 

the brief. 

The elections directors’ demerit 

report 
argued 
that 
liking 
and 

commenting on social media posts 

explicitly campaigning should only 

be counted as implicit campaigning. 

“When liking or commenting (on) 

a post, it does advertise and endorse 

the sentiment of the post, and if that 

post is campaigning, it is the person 

who liked or commented on it that is 

implicitly campaigning,” Ziel wrote 

in the report. 

Schuler 
and 
Pamidighantam’s 

CSJ appeal, however, claims the 

Facebook posts were neither implicit 

nor explicit campaigning. Likes or 

comments themselves don’t mention 

a particular candidate and shouldn’t 

be considered campaigning at all, 

they argued. 

“The comparison of (Bazzi’s) 

messages to liking or commenting 

on a social media post, which 

is 
determined 
to 
be 
implicit 

campaigning for the purposes of 

this and other decisions, would be a 

false equivalency, as such an action 

would not mention the name of any 

particular candidate,” the appeal 

said. 

Ultimately, 
Schuler 
and 

Pamidighantam’s 
report 
and 

Watt and Fivecoat’s brief present 

diverging arguments: Schuler and 

Pamidighantam feel that posting 

about voting in the Facebook group 

would be considered posting to 

increase 
voter 
turnout, 
which 

would not be a violation of the 

rules. Watt and Fivecoat, on the 

other hand, argue that the context 

of the Facebook page being for 

their campaign makes it explicit 

campaigning, which would be a 

violation.

No demerit report was issued 

for the posts Watt and Fivecoat 

mentioned 
because 
they 
went 

unreported during the election. 

These posts, however, will be at least 

read by CSJ as they are part of the 

brief.

Student voice versus the code 

Watt and Fivecoat’s brief notes 

that Schuler and Pamidighantam’s 

call for increased demerits for 

Bazzi’s 
GroupMe 
posts 
would 

eliminate Bazzi and Walker from the 

race altogether, a penalty Watt and 

Fivecoat believe is disproportionate 

to the posts’ impact.

Bazzi 
said 
Schuler 
and 

Pamidighantam’s appeal disregards 

the importance of the student 

body’s voice in elections. Bazzi and 

Walker did not report the Facebook 

comments from the amicus curiae 

brief because it could impact the 

final vote due to insignificant social 

media posts. They argued that 

would be an act of voter suppression.

“We didn’t follow through with 

filing instances of demerits against 

our opponents because we wanted 

the results to overall be a reflection 

of what the student body wants,” 

Bazzi said. “If anything, what we 

prioritize first is the student voice. 

Student voice before all these 

loopholes in the Constitution and 

demerits. Student voice is what’s 

important.”

In 
an 
amicus 
curiae 
brief 

submitted to the CSJ defending 

Schuler’s appeal, 2019 elections 

directors Nicholas Fadanelli, now 

an alum, and Nicholas Martire, 

Public 
Policy 
senior, 
said 
the 

current elections directors’ decision 

to 
reduce 
Bazzi 
and 
Walker’s 

demerit count from seven – six 

from the GroupMe messages and 

one from another violation – to 

three was inherently arbitrary and 

antidemocratic. 

“If candidates are capable of 

violating election regulation to 

such extremes that they should be 

disqualified but do not receive any 

punishment, it cannot be argued 

that the rule of law is being upheld 

by even the broad standard set by 

the United Nations for determining 

if elections are truly free and 

democratic,” Fadanelli and Martire 

wrote in the brief. “Upholding the 

Defendant’s decision would set 

precedent 
chilling 
enforcement 

of election regulation and heavily 

imply to candidates that violations 

of election regulation do not matter, 

and encourage them to do so in 

order to win.” 

Fadanelli and Martire argued the 

reduced demerits severely violate 

the integrity of the LSA SG elections. 

“(Elections director Tyler Ziel) 

cites Election Code § 08.05 as 

justification for establishing this 

new standard as it enables them 

to interpret the Election Code 

in a ‘liberal manner,’” Fadanelli 

and 
Martire 
wrote. 
“However, 

Election Code § 08.05 has two 

clearly competing priorities within 

it - that rules should be interpreted 

‘liberally in favor of free and open 

communication and debate’ and ‘to 

protect the integrity of the election 

process’. Therefore in this case we 

must ask which of these priorities 

takes precedence over the other?”

In their CSJ appeal, Schuler 

and Pamidighantam argue that if 

candidates can break election code 

without threat to their candidacy, 

there will be nothing to discourage 

such violations.

“We are concerned that the 

current decision sets a dangerous 

precedent that allows candidates to 

violate election code to win without 

the threat of the proper enforcement 

of punishment,” the appeal reads. 

The positions hang in the 

balance

In April 2019, then-elections 

directors Fadanelli and Martire 

advised the LSA SG Executive Board 

to better define what constituted 

campaigning during the voting 

period.

“A 
coherent 
policy 
about 

Facebook events must be codified 

in the bylaws if campaigning during 

the voting period is still banned,” 

Fadanelli and Martire wrote in the 

email to the board.

A year later, the same policy 

Fadanelli 
and 
Martire 
raised 

concern about could impact the 

outcome of this election.

All involved parties — Bazzi 

and 
Walker, 
Schuler 
and 

Pamidighantam, 
Ziel 
and 
Suh, 

Fadanelli and Martire, and Watt and 

Fivecoat — agreed that the COVID-

19 outbreak forcing students off 

campus put an additional emphasis 

on virtual campaigning. 

Without a final decision, neither 

Bazzi and Walker nor Schuler and 

Pamidighantam can assume the 

positions of president and vice 

president and begin leading LSA SG. 

The decision now rests with CSJ 

to determine the intent of Bazzi’s 

posts.

From Page 1


Observed by Muslims, the holy 

month of Ramadan sets forth a 

month of fasting, spiritual reflection 

and personal growth. Muslims are 

intrinsically joined together by 

group prayers, shared meals and 

charitable 
activities, 
propelling 

the meaning of Ramadan through 

connectedness. 
Exemplifying 

this connectedness is Dearborn, 

Mich., one of the largest Muslim 

communities in the U.S.

Encapsulating 
the 
unique 

experience that is Ramadan in 

Dearborn is difficult; in broadest 

terms, 

Dearborn 
becomes 
its 
most 

vibrant version of itself showcasing 

diversity 
and 
connectedness. 

Restaurants extend their hours 

(some even until 5 a.m.), mosques 

become 
filled 
with 
people 

praying and socializing, young 

entrepreneurs open food stands, 

community members rally together 

for charitable causes and gratitude 

becomes inherent.

When asked what motivated 

him to start a food stand during 

last Ramadan, Business sophomore 

Adam Bazzi responded, “Growing 

up in Dearborn, I’ve had the luxury 

of being able to enjoy Ramadan in a 

way that not many other Muslims 

around the country can say they 

have, and what really drove us to 

open our stand was to add to that 

uniqueness through connecting our 

community in a meaningful way.” 

With social distancing in full 

effect, the Dearborn community will 

have to redefine what community 

connectedness means during this 

unprecedented Ramadan. 

“Community 
connectedness 

will no longer exist through shared 

meals, bonfires, festivals and food 

stands, but come from the fact that 

we will be social distancing and 

fasting together,” LSA senior, Silan 

Fadlallah said. 

Last 
Ramadan, 
more 
than 

12,000 
people 
attended 
the 

annual Ramadan Suhoor Festival, 

which was created by community 

members to combine Suhoor, the 

pre-dawn meal Muslims have each 

day before fasting, with charity. 

Social distancing has canceled the 

community gathering component 

of the Ramadan Suhoor Festival 

but their pillar of charity lives 

on through their current work. 

Currently, 
the 
organizers 
of 

the festival are utilizing their 

platform to gather donations for 

N95 face masks for local hospitals 

and funeral homes in Dearborn. 

More than 12,000 masks will be 

distributed this upcoming week. 

Hassan Chami, founder of the 

Ramadan Suhoor Festival, wants 

to inspire community members to 

invest in their spirituality.

“Ramadan will definitely be 

different this year, and will be 

one to remember. With Ramadan 

approaching 
us 
during 
these 

uncommon times, God has created 

a platform for us to build a stronger 

and more spiritual relationship 

with him by limiting our normal 

worldly distractions,” Chami said. 

“For this reason, I hope to take 

advantage of this Ramadan as we 

don’t know if we’ll ever have a time 

like this again.”

With 
a 
new 
definition 
of 

community connectedness, there 

comes the question, “where are 

Muslims left spiritually?” LSA 

freshman 
Noor 
Moughni, 
a 

columnist on Michigan in Color, 

reflected on how she will continue 

her spiritual journey while social 

distancing.

 “The time I would’ve spent 

waiting in line at Bohemian Bowls, 

bonding with others over how 

amazing the almond butter there 

is, I will now spend on my prayer 

rug, exploring my spirituality and 

the complexities of faith,” Moughni 

said. “Ramadan this year will be my 

time to realign my beliefs. A time to 

escape the confusion of the world 

and confide in God. I look forward 

to a month devoted to reflection and 

self-improvement. I look forward to 

an isolated Ramadan.”

Dearborn’s experience with this 

year’s Ramadan is a microcosm of 

what the greater Muslim world will 

be facing. Despite the community 

isolation Muslims worldwide will 

experience, the true essence of 

Ramadan will prevail: A reminder 

to Muslims that all is temporary and 

that faith transcends all adversities 

— 
even 
a 
global 
pandemic. 

Muslims will be able to experience 

spirituality in its truest form: 

isolated.

UNSPLASH

An isolated Ramadan 

My family,

rose from the mud 

to make matters more pleasant for me. 

From my environment,

I cultivated primal instincts

and learned about survivability.

The king of our jungle had 

an igneous spirit.

Still I’ve come to learn that powers exist, 

which could move mountains.

This seemed impossible, 

I grew up idolizing the posture of a rock: 

the immovable object, the unaffected entity. 

Some things are above me and not 

because they’re heavenly;

but I miss when that meant,

the vast never ending sky.

I try to understand the underhanded

movements which control society.

Silently sliding my environment’s tectonics, 

unbeknownst to them this would leave my life 

reminiscent of the ground zero of 

a nuclear bombing.

We lived from the earth and paid the country’s dues,

worked hard to be polished people, 

doing what we had to do

to get through.

Lived off the earth, 

we bonded by nurturing its creatures, 

prepping grain in exchange for early morning melodies.

Unable to fulfill the hollow feeling

“they”

have left me with me,

unlike the deciduous tree who deals with ICE

in a seasonal stride.

But the sun will shine tomorrow and today

just as it did yesterday.

Together forever and never we stray.

A reading list to celebrate Arab Heritage Month (and beyond)

In case you didn’t know, what 

with the whole global pandemic 

and everything, we’re right in the 

middle of Arab Heritage Month! 

In the U.S., April is dedicated to 

celebrating the rich history, culture 

and contemporary voices of Arabs 

and Arab Americans. And what 

better way to celebrate than with 

new reading material!

For the poets:

Water and Salt

 by Lena Khalaf Tuffaha

Lena Khalaf Tuffaha’s debut 

collection of poetry, “Water and 

Salt” gives a voice for those (past, 

present and future) who have been 

forever marred by displacement 

from their home country. It explores 

loss, suffering and unimaginable 

pain, but also strength, defiance, 

resilience and determination. It’s a 

gorgeous collection of poetry and a 

forever recommendation.

For those who love fantasy:

The Map of Salt and Stars 

by Zeyn Joukhader

In 
Zeyn 
Joukhader’s 
debut 

novel, he takes readers on a 

beautiful journey that follows the 

parallel stories of Nour, a young 

Syrian girl who flees her homeland 

and travels across North Africa 

with her family, and Rawiya, a 

12th-century 
adventurer 
who 

disguises herself as a boy in order 

to apprentice herself to a famous 

mapmaker.

For those who love fantasy:

Sitt Marie Rose by Etal Adnan

Sitt Marie Rose is one of those books 

that, once you start reading, you can’t 

put it down. Set before and during the 

Lebanese Civil War, the novel creates 

a split between West and East Beirut, 

Muslim and Christian, Lebanese, 

Syrian and Palestinian, and explores 

how all of these variables interacted 

with one another during the Civil War. 

Adnan critiques sexism, xenophobia 

and the idea that a single person can 

speak for all the people in Lebanon.

For the feminist:

Him Me and Muhammad Ali 

by Randa Jarrar

Randa Jarrar is a writer, memoirist, 

and comedian sharing her experience 

as a Muslim American born of 

Egyptian and Palestinian parents. 

SAnd she’s not only an incredible 

writer, but she’s a Michigan alum 

too! Her work is biting, funny, and 

brilliantly honest. If you end up falling 

in love with this collection of short 

stories, you should definitely check out 

her debut novel, A Map of Home.


A

s of April 2020, we 

can all recognize that 

Michigan is in a state 

of turmoil. The protest against 

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 

stay-at-home decision in East 

Lansing, Mich. demonstrated 

the political unrest of some 

Michigan 
citizens. 
COVID-

19 has left our campus a ghost 

town. The fulfilling sense of 

community we once enjoyed 

dissipated beginning in mid-

March. Not only are we facing 

unprecedented 
obstacles 
in 

confronting a global pandemic 

that has significantly altered our 

lives, but we are also faced with 

a “lesser of two evils” election, 

yet again. On March 8, more 

than 10,000 students, citizens 

and spectators gathered to see 

candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, 

I-Vt. speak in hopes of returning 

to his 2016 primary success in the 

great state of Michigan. Cheers 

echoed among the reinforced 

concrete. The sails of the left-

wing 
progressive 
movement 

lost its wind after a series of 

major losses bringing Sanders 

to suspend his campaign just a 

month later. 

Yet again, the millions of 

young 
people 
Sanders 
and 

the 
progressive 
movement 

mobilized are left disillusioned 

— now, a potential voting block 

is being condescended to with 

the well-known phrase “Vote 

blue no matter who.” Now, we 

must choose between former 

Vice President Joe Biden and 

President Donald Trump. This 

is 
disheartening 
for 
many, 

particularly 
because 
both 

candidates have been accused of 

sexual assault. 

Sadly, the presidency of the 

United States is no stranger to 

sexual misconduct. It is widely 

acknowledged that Trump has 

assaulted 
numerous 
women. 

This is evident from both his 

lengthy list of accusations and 

his own comments dismissing 

the allegations. As his defense, 

he explained he couldn’t have 

sexually assaulted these women 

because they were not appealing 

to him, not because assault 

is 
abhorrent. 
President 
Bill 

Clinton is known for his famous 

quote, “I did not have sexual 

relations with that woman, Miss 

Lewinsky,” in which he lied 

under oath about inappropriate 

relations with a subordinate. 

This often takes precedence 

in conversation over multiple 

other allegations against him. 

Presidents Ronald Reagan and 

George H. W. Bush have been 

accused of sexual misconduct. 

Even the revered Founding 

Father Thomas Jefferson has 

an 
incriminating 
record 
of 

maintaining 
a 
toxic 
sexual 

power 
dynamic 
with 
Sally 

Hemmings. While the current 

election 
is 
uncomfortable 

thanks to the validity and 

gravity 
of 
the 
allegations 

against both men, it should 

not be a surprise. However, 

this agonizing discussion will 

be either swept under the rug 

or hypocritically weaponized 

against the opposition.

For many, the choice to 

vote for Joe Biden is easy. He 

is 
currently 
advocating 
for 

multiple forms of prison reform 

including sentencing justice, 

ending cash bail and abolishing 

the death penalty. Biden has 

also adopted Sanders’ stance 

to raise the minimum wage 

to $15 an hour, and supports 

paid sick leave. Importantly, 

while he rejects the notion of 

Medicare for All, he would 

like to expand coverage for 

health 
care. 
These 
policy 

stances are bold, considering 

his moderate track record and 

tendency to stay away from 

controversial stances. When 

comparing Biden to Trump, the 

numerous instances of gross 

incompetence and disrespect 

Trump touts in a trail of tweets 

and press conferences makes 

the decision seem obvious, 

leaving 
Democrats, 
leftists, 

moderates and some moderate-

conservatives with a correct 

and incorrect choice. Policy-

wise, there should be a clear 

winner. The narrative is quickly 

echoing that of 2016 — even if 

you don’t like the democratic 

candidate, 
you 
must 
vote 

for them, or you are directly 

responsible for the (re)election 

of Trump. 

In order for this country to 

be able to move forward from 

this 
period 
of 
uncertainty, 

division and distrust, we must 

diligently respect that every 

individual has one vote, and 

actively maintain the humanity 

of the democratic process for 

every single voter. Silencing 

the discourse of abusive gender 

power 
dynamics 
will 
only 

continue the suppression of 

survivors. 

I am privileged to be able to 

vote, yet as a survivor of sexual 

assault, being told I must 

choose between two men that 

have been accused of sexual 

misconduct to be president is 

revolting. I understand that 

lifelong Supreme Court seats 

may be filled in the next four 

years. Presidential elections 

impact the American political 

landscape 
for 
decades, 

shaping discourse, policy and 

perception. While we have 

a 
representative 
democracy, 

people of color and women 

have 
been 
historically 

disenfranchised, 
so 
the 

ability to vote cannot be taken 

lightly. But just because the 

electoral system currently in 

place reinforces the two-party 

system does not mean that 

voters must vote a certain way. 

The right to vote is relatively 

new on a historic and global 

scale, yet it is being minimized 

by 
discourse 
from 
within 

the left today. The “vote blue 

no matter who” coalition is 

leveraging a vote for Biden 

as a vote against Trump, and 

while 
this 
sentiment 
has 

truth in our current electoral 

system, it is disheartening, 

even condescending, to the 

disillusioned voters grappling 

with their decision. Ultimately, 

the process of voting is deeply 

personal as well as political, and 

in a time of fear, what we must 

do as Americans is engage with 

our community, acknowledge 

the complexity of the election 

at hand and empower one 

another to vote for a candidate 

that earns it. Both as a student 

majoring in political science 

and American culture at the 

University of Michigan and as 

a survivor, I urge you to tread 

very carefully in discussions 

about the upcoming election, 

and embrace varying opinions 

with grace and empathy rather 

than aggression.

T

he 
impact 
of 
COVID-

19 
exemplifies 
how 
the 

existing health system in the 

United States discriminates against 

marginalized groups. Data supports 

that in larger cities, such populations 

are contracting coronavirus and dying 

at a disproportionately high rate. 

For example, in Michigan, African 

Americans make up about 33 percent 

of COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of 

deaths, despite constituting only 14 

percent of the population.

But this disparity does not only 

exist with health care outcomes. 

Rather, these disparities start early 

within the chain of medical care: lack 

of testing for the African American 

population. This leads to delays in 

diagnosis and therefore delays in 

treatment, leading to worse outcomes 

due 
to 
coronavirus’s 

quick progression. Lack 

of testing is often due 

to the fact that lower-

income areas of the 

country and institutions 

with little funding do 

not have equal access 

to 
testing 
equipment 

and personal protective 

gear.

It’s 
important 
to 

realize that this is not a new issue, 

but the by-product of a pre-existing 

system 
that 
caters 
best 
to 
the 

elite class in the U.S. If you’re not 

financially stable and you’re a person 

of color, it’s likely that health care 

services are not readily available to 

you as health care is a privilege rather 

than a right. This isn’t a riddle, it’s a 

reality that lower-income areas of the 

U.S. lack hospitals and primary care 

physicians. For example, a special 

report produced by Journal Sentinel 

maps a breakdown of primary care 

physicians in poorer neighborhoods 

in comparison to large affluent cities. 

It’s clear that the poorer areas are 

facing a physician shortage, which 

means that there are upwards of 

3,500 residents per primary care 

physician in that area. These patient 

populations are often heavily reliant 

on student-run clinics and emergency 

care community centers. This is 

because single income households 

cannot afford to pay out-of-pocket 

costs and premiums. Programs that 

support marginalized groups include 

but are not limited to Medicare, 

Medicaid and the Children’s Health 

Insurance Program. 

A figure in a health report on 

“Racism, Inequality, and Health Care 

for African Americans” constructed 

by The Century Foundation depicts 

the stark maternal health outcomes 

between 
African 
American 
and 

white women. “However, disparities 

still exist across health conditions 

when comparing African Americans 

and 
whites, 
including 
maternal 

mortality, infant mortality, heart 

disease, 
diabetes, 
cancer, 
and 

other health issues.” In addition, 

underrepresented minority groups 

suffer from the effects of social 

factors compounded with medical 

conditions. Social factors include 

income inequality, insurance status, 

inequities in education and lack of 

access to health care, thus impacting 

a person’s ability to lead a healthy 

life. Racism and discrimination are 

additional examples of social factors 

that not only take a toll on mental 

well-being but also impact the level 

of access to health care. During 

this pandemic, many of us live with 

the security that if we do not have 

underlying health conditions we’re 

better protected from the worst of 

it. However, minority communities 

more 
frequently 
fall 
under 
the 

category of at-risk populations as 

they’re disproportionately impacted 

by chronic illnesses and underlying 

health conditions like diabetes and 

lung disease. 

Dr. 
Sharnell 
Barber, 
assistant 

professor 
of 
biostatistics 
and 

epidemiology at Drexel University, 

states 
that 
“these 
communities, 

structurally, 
they’re 
breeding 

grounds for the transmission of 

the disease ... It’s not biological. 

It’s really these existing structural 

inequalities that are going to shape 

the racial inequalities 

in 
this 
pandemic.” 

The 
maintenance 
of 

structural inequalities 

is 
how 
the 
cycle 

perpetuates. 

These inequities in 

the current health care 

model are unacceptable. 

So then the question 

that arises is: How can 

hospitals better serve 

and deliver care to diverse patient 

populations? To better serve diverse 

patient populations, the hospitals 

within this system must embrace 

a 
patient-centered 
focus 
with 

consumer-friendly health solutions. 

To accomplish this requires an 

entire paradigm shift in the purpose 

of the health care system. Currently, 

the health care system is driven by 

churning out a high volume of patients 

rather than focused on producing 

better health care outcomes. Per the 

Health System Tracker, in comparison 

to international prices for health 

services and prescription drug costs, 

today the costs of medical procedures 

in the U.S. are more costly than 

medical procedures anywhere else. 

Many may argue this is proportional 

to the standard of care available in the 

U.S. such as readily available testing 

and innovative health care solutions 

but upon further examination, the 

demand for lower costs and improved 

outcomes surpasses the standard of 

care here. 

It’s beautiful to see how in times 

of true need, so many community 

members are stepping up to contribute 

to the efforts. This type of support 

for 
at-risk 
populations 
needs 
to 

operate year-round with or without 

a pandemic present. Listen to the 

numbers and listen to the public health 

experts, they serve as a voice for 

those who are silenced by the system. 

Universal health coverage cannot be 

achieved while racism, biases and 

other oppressive barriers persist in 

health care. COVID-19 opened our 

eyes to the fact that as a nation, we 

are not prepared to address the public 

health needs of all people. Providers 

and hospitals need to invest in closing 

the gaps in medically underserved 

communities. While innovative health 

care solutions that serve all patients 

equally aren’t easy to come by, we 

also cannot continue to fail our at-risk 

patient populations with the current 

systemic barriers in place. Because 

health care is a human right.

The Strokes are a transportive band, not 

just in the tongue-in-cheek nostalgia of their 

stylistic references, but in the way their 

music can fixate you in memories. Of course, 

the music we hear at one time in our lives 

inherently grounds itself in our memories 

of that time, but this fact could not be more 

personally applicable to Is This It, the band’s 

bittersweet debut album, released in 2001. 

Despite 
the 
youthful, 
incandescent 

brightness of that album, it often reminds me 

of how memories can be ambiguous and messy, 

distorting the way music hits your ears over 

time. Is This It is a complicated album for The 

Strokes, as both a playground of near-flawless, 

punchy jams and simultaneously a bar too high 

to be reached by the band’s later work.

Their latest album, The New Abnormal, 

attempts to free itself from the burden of 

memory, and the result is a genuinely fun — 

even if inconsequential — reminder of what The 

Strokes once were. It is wistful, grin-inducing 

and, at times, unbearably catchy. It doesn’t 

move mountains or break new ground or 

warrant another legendary SNL performance, 

but I’m certainly glad it’s here. 

The New Abnormal is at its best when it 

regresses into The Strokes’ signature style; 

Julian Casablancas’ vocals fall somewhere 

between a croon and a mutter, with jaunty 

guitar licks that flow so effortlessly it 

hurts. “The Adults Are Talking” and “Why 

Are 
Sundays 

So 
Depressing” 

exemplify this return 

to familiarity without 

feeling like replicas of 

other Strokes material, 

balancing 
the 
line 

between comfort and 

freshness. 

Undoubtedly 
the 

strongest track to fit 

this 
well-balanced 

familiarity 
is 
“Ode 

to the Mets,” which 

closes 
the 
album 

with such infectious 

sweetness 
that 
it 
overshadows 
almost 

everything else. There’s this guitar melody 

that finishes off the last two minutes, and it’s 

as ingenious as anything The Strokes have 

ever written. “Gone now are the old times / 

Forgotten, time to hold on the railing / The 

Rubik’s Cube isn’t solving for us,” Casablancas 

muses over the riff. His words are undoubtedly 

sad, but I can’t help but smile at the sentiment 

every time. I find myself recalling these notes 

over and over again in my head, like sunspots 

in my vision. 

As a complete playthrough, the album is 

pleasant even if it’s not totally engaging. Not 

every song is memorable, but the standouts 

earn their place. It’s been seven years since the 

last Strokes album, and in that time, a few of 

the band’s members 

have stayed busy with 

their 
own 
musical 

endeavors. 
These 

layers 
of 
influence 

add electronic, almost 

disco flare to tracks 

like “Eternal Summer” 

and “At the Door.” 

They 
approximate 

the soothing grime 

of Casablancas’ side 

project 
The 
Voidz 

without 
disrupting 

the album’s flow. And 

yet, it’s impossible to 

overlook the fact that these experiments with 

style are often the weak points of The New 

Abnormal. 

However, just because the album fails to 

reinvigorate the sound of The Strokes doesn’t 

mean it shouldn’t be celebrated. To me, The 

Strokes’ return to making music is a medium 

to enjoy their work without the complex 

memories I have of their more polished albums. 

It’s fun, and yes, there are certainly more 

qualities a listener can ask of a Strokes album. 

But honestly, I can’t bring myself to care.

ALBUM REVIEW

So many of our childhoods are made up of 

Disney movies. How could you forget the first 

time you watched Aladdin and Jasmine soaring 

on a magic carpet, Ariel passionately singing 

“Part of Your World” or even Tarzan seeing 

Jane for the first time? But while everyone 

remembers and appreciates those movies so 

much, oftentimes we forget that Disney made 

sequels for a lot of them. They may not have 

gotten the same amount of attention as their 

predecessors, but some are worth a watch. So 

here’s a list of six of the most underrated Disney 

sequels you should give a chance.

“Mulan II” (2004)

Besides “Frozen II,” the sequel to “Mulan” 

is probably the most watched and respected 

animated Disney sequel. What sets this movie 

apart from the original is the addition of three 

princesses, the emperor’s daughters. We get to 

see their love stories unfold while also getting 

to watch Mulan blossom into an even fiercer, 

more determined and more inspiring woman. 

We also get to see more of Mushu in this 

movie (who is, of course, the best part) along 

with the three army men from the first movie, 

Yao, Ling and Chien Po: supporting characters 

from the first film whose roles are much more 

important in this one. Not to mention, this 

movie has some incredible songs like “Lesson 

Number One” and “I Wanna Be Like Other 

Girls” that are often overlooked. I will admit, 

though, that there are parts of this film that 

even to this day I have to watch through my 

fingers because they’re so devastating, but 

the added suspense and emotion that those 

scenes add makes the overall movie-watching 

experience so much better. 

“Aladdin and the King of Thieves” (1996) 

The second “Aladdin” movie, “Aladdin 

and the Return of Jafar,” isn’t very good, and 

in my opinion, that’s mostly because Robin 

Williams doesn’t voice Genie. However, he 

returns as Genie in the third film, “Aladdin 

and the King of Thieves.” This movie is 

absolutely 
incredible 
for 
more 
reasons 

than Williams’s return; it focuses more on 

Aladdin’s childhood and his family, which 

adds many more dimensions to his already 

interesting character. There are magical 

oracles, sword fights and Genie dressing 

up as Disney princesses — all the necessary 

components to an all-around perfect film. 

There are also some surprising voice actors in 

the film, such as John Rhys-Davies — famous 

for playing Gimli in the “Lord of the Rings” 

films — in the role of Aladdin’s father Cassim. 

This film, though maybe not as well animated 

as the first, is one that everyone should watch. 

It’s heartwarming and maintains the action-

packed elements that make the first film 

so exhilarating. Plus, you finally get to see 

Aladdin and Jasmine’s wedding, which is well 

worth the wait. 

“Tarzan and Jane” (2002) 

There are actually two films that go 

along with Disney’s “Tarzan.” One of them 

is “Tarzan 2,” which is a prequel that shows 

Tarzan as a young boy, and the other is 

“Tarzan and Jane,” which features Jane and 

her friends Terk and Tantor (yes, the gorilla 

and elephant from “Tarzan”) recounting 

many stories about Tarzan and Jane. A lot 

of people choose to overlook films like these 

because there isn’t one central plot, but these 

kinds of movies can actually be really fun. 

For instance, in “Tarzan and Jane,” we get to 

see Jane’s prim and proper English friends 

come for a visit in the jungle, along with a 

story involving diamonds and lava-surfing 

and another starring an old friend of Jane’s 

of whom Tarzan quickly becomes jealous. 

These mini-stories are short but still hold your 

attention. The final scene of the film explains 

why Jane, Terk and Tantor have been taking a 

trip down memory lane, and the reason is sure 

to bring a smile to your face. 

“Cinderella II: Dreams Come True” 

(2001) 

Similar to “Tarzan and Jane,” the second 

“Cinderella” film contains three mini-stories. 

These stories aren’t told by Cinderella though; 

they’re told by the mice. In my opinion, the 

first “Cinderella” film didn’t highlight the 

mice as much as it should have. They’re fun 

and funny, and we get to see a lot more of them 

in this sequel. The mice want to make a book 

for Cinderella, so they begin to handcraft one 

that features their very own stories. The three 

stories we get to hear are about Cinderella’s 

first day in the castle, Jaq’s wish-gone-wrong 

and Cinderella’s stepsister Anastasia’s love 

story with the humble baker. I can’t even tell 

you how many times I’ve seen this movie. 

Each story is short and sweet, punctuated by 

catchy songs and beautiful colors. One of my 

absolute favorite things about these stories is 

the hilarious amount of time dedicated to the 

evil cat Lucifer’s love life. I’m not sure who 

came up with that idea, but I would thank 

them if I could. There is a third “Cinderella” 

movie, “Cinderella III: A Twist in Time,” 

which I think is more well-known than the 

second film. But I’ll be honest: Even though 

the third film is good, I think the second one 

is better. 

“The Little Mermaid II: Return to the 

Sea” (2000) 

I’m pretty sure everyone has that one DVD 

from their childhood that they watched so 

many times, they actually ruined the disc. For 

me, that DVD was “The Little Mermaid II.” 

Ariel was always my favorite Disney princess 

growing up, so of course I loved the sequel, 

where we not only get to see her as an adult 

but also get to meet her daughter Melody. The 

movie is unbelievably ironic considering the 

events of its predecessor, given the fact that 

Melody is a human who is forced to stay away 

from the water. But she’s just as curious as 

her mother and ends up finding a way there 

anyway. The sweet story by itself would have 

been enough to make me love this movie, but 

it also has many callbacks to the original film 

that make me nostalgic; there are some shots 

that look like they were taken straight from 

the original film and switched from Ariel 

to Melody. Even the villain in this movie, 

Morgana, has a connection to the original: 

She’s Ursula’s sister! There may be some plot 

holes, like Melody never questioning why she 

could talk to animals, but I’ve always looked 

past them to enjoy the happiness of the film. 

This, in my opinion, is the peak Disney sequel 

because it does something completely new but 

remains true to the original. It’s not a perfect 

movie, but the nostalgia washes over you and 

makes you feel like a kid again.

Study abroad in a pandemic: a timeline 

MARCH 4

Cases in Spain rose to 228 

with 76 in Madrid. It became 

a habit that everyone would 

reload the Spanish news 

websites live-reporting on 

the current number of cases 

in the city. Everything in our 

lives had become “wait and 

see” and the only concrete 

information that we could 

look at was the statistics 

loaded more than every hour. 

In our common areas, the 

only topics of conversations 

were about “corona” and 

midterms.

MARCH 3

I arrived in Madrid with my 

three suitcases, a great deal 

of exhaustion, a ton of excite-

ment and an equal amount of 

fear for what I was about to get 

myself into. I had spent all of 

winter break getting ready for 

my semester abroad and, still, 

the moment I got to the airport 

I was so anxious about what 

there would be for me across the 

ocean. A new language, a new 

currency, a city so much larger 

than I had ever lived in before. I 

had so many ideas about what I 

wanted to do, while also having 

so many questions about what 

this experience would really be 

like. Let’s just say, the semester 

had some surprises in store for 

us all.

After having about a month 

in Madrid with the other study 

abroad students with me, we had a 

good routine down. We had made 

friends, all our classes had started, 

and we could buy things at the store 

without forgetting every single 

word of our fourth-grade Spanish 

(más o menos). Every weekend we 

would take some sort of excursion 

to a new place in Spain or Europe, 

my friends and I would get tapas 

every Tuesday night, and we could 

find our way through the public 

transportation system. We were 

all paying attention to the news of 

coronavirus, and by that time we 

heard rumors about gaining cases 

in Italy, but as it was to the rest of 

the world, we all still considered it 

a topic of conversation rather than a 

topic of concern.

On this day, US citizens 

received information from 

the US Embassy in Madrid 

that the first cases were sus-

pected in Spain, one of which 

in Madrid. I remember I was 

sitting in my health sciences 

course when we all got that 

email and texted started fly-

ing. We all started to put up a 

little bit of a defense against 

our worries about it coming 

to the city that we had start-

ed to consider as our home. 

Fifteen cases were report-

ed in Spain, one of which in 

Madrid with an unknown 

origin. After getting news of 

this, there was an underly-

ing knowledge throughout 

our cohort that this one case 

meant that Madrid would be 

exploding with cases within 

two weeks. 

The number of cases in 

Spain elevated to 76. This is 

when our nerves about the 

ramifications of this pan-

demic started to rise drasti-

cally. I specifically remember 

so many of us repeating the 

same thing: “I give us two 

weeks”. 

Only two days later, airlines 

started to cancel flights. I had 

planned to travel to Italy for our 

spring break, “semana santa”, 

with my family who would come 

from Michigan to visit, and Vien-

na with a friend before that, but 

we got notice that the flights had 

been cancelled. These cancel-

lations were earlier than many 

others, a sign of the lack of trans-

portation between countries that 

would soon ensue.

MARCH 8

202 cases in Madrid, 644 in 

Spain. Public transport danger 

became our major topic of con-

versation along with the view 

of health care in the country. 

We had been told over and over 

about the difference in person-

al space definition in Spain in 

comparison to the US, and at 

this point, it became a reason 

to suspect that Madrid could be 

in real trouble soon. In Spain, 

the common greeting is kiss-

ing one another on the cheeks, 

something that takes some get-

ting used to as Americans. The 

social change that would ensue 

because of social distancing 

would be drastic.

MARCH 13

I remember sitting on the floor of my 

room in my homestay when I got a text 

in a group-chat of friends saying to turn 

on the television and watch the Madrid 

news. We didn’t have a television, so my 

roommate and I sat together and started 

refreshing the news pages. Then it was 

uploaded. Madrid had made a declara-

tion that all educational facilities would 

be closed for three weeks. IES Madrid 

alerted us that our learning would be 

transferred to online and that every-

thing would continue as normal. They 

had no intentions of closing the program 

or any reason to think that we would 

return to normal class in the three 

weeks. There were 644 cases in Madrid 

as of that day. University of Michigan 

students received news that the program 

was aware of the situation in Madrid and 

it was under review.

In the morning, my roommate 

and I woke up still in shock that 

there would be no classes in-per-

son, and just sitting and waiting for 

our universities to notify us what 

their decision was. We went to Buen 

Retiro park to sit in the sun, not fully 

knowing how much more time we 

had. There were 1600 cases in Spain, 

782 of which in Madrid. That night, a 

large group of students from the IES 

program all ended up at Círculo de 

Bellas Artes, a lookout over the city, 

to watch the sunset. We talked about 

the possibility of getting sent home, 

some students were convinced we 

would be able to stay, others took a 

more pessimistic approach. Regard-

less, we all sat and watched the sun-

set over the buildings of our Spanish 

home, took pictures, and reminisced 

over what wonderful things we were 

able to do. That evening, I got the 

email from U of M announcing their 

decision to pull all students from 

Spain.

While things had been getting cra-

zier in Spain, stress was growing back 

in the US as well. U of M announced 

their decision to cancel all in-person 

classes which shocked us all. We had 

been living in a city with so many 

cases, and with just the beginnings 

of the pandemic in Michigan, class-

es were cancelled right away. I am 

still trying to find a way to explain 

the difference in perspective that I 

had compared to my friends back in 

Ann Arbor, not better or worse, but 

entirely different. Despite constant 

conversations about the virus, I had 

never felt in danger or that there was 

anything to be afraid of by being in a 

place with so many cases. Being then 

able to look towards the US and see-

ing how differently they reacted was 

so interesting. This perspective on 

how the different parts of the world 

reacted to this pandemic and contin-

ues to react will be so interesting to 

dissect more as time carries this part 

of history through.

I woke up later that morning after staying up later read-

ing the news about Spain and Italy, cancelling trips I had 

planned and talking to my parents trying to comprehend 

what was happening. By the time I rolled over and checked 

my phone, it was well past 10am and, within the hours I had 

been sleeping, the entire world changed. I had notifications 

from friends saying they were boarding planes, on busses, 

re-booked flights, and that all the sudden if I didn’t get home 

within twenty-four hours, I would be stuck in Spain for 

months. The president had announced the travel restrictions 

for all of Europe and Spain had obtained a level 3 travel advi-

sory by the CDC and State Department as Spain had reached 

3000 cases in the country. A time of reaction filled of misin-

formation, we all the sudden were under the impression that 

we needed to fly back that day. A great way to wake up in 

the morning. After calling my parents, 2am in the Midwest, 

I re-scheduled a flight back for Friday the 13th after making 

one for Saturday only two days before. Only slightly later did 

it become clear that US citizens would not be affected in the 

travel ban. But regardless, my roommate and I spent our days 

packing up our lives and shoving them into the couple suit-

cases we had, telling our host mom that we would be leav-

ing the next day. After packing up my study abroad room, 

I walked around the park with some of my closest friends 

that I made while in Madrid, and watched the sunset over 

Temple de Debod, the last sunset we would be able to see in 

Madrid. 

I woke up at 4am to catch a taxi to the airport for a 9am flight back to the US, 

because the lines had been hours long to get through security the day before. 

I took a plane with several other students from my program, many of which 

had masks on for the plane ride. Airport personal passed out gloves and masks, 

and we were forced to go through extra security checks due to Department of 

Homeland Security’s new measures. After a ten-hour flight, we landed in Atlan-

ta. Expecting tests for fever or illness, I made sure to have plenty of time for 

my layover. To my surprise and astonishment, I had to go through no health 

checks on my arrival. My passport was barely checked, and no questions about 

my health were made.
