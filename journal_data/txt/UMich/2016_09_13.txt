Acclaimed 
author 
Peter 

Kornbluh, an Ann Arbor native, 
advocated for open negotiations 
between the U.S. and the Cuban 
government 
with 
several 

anecdotes about secret meetings 
and spies at Literati Bookstore 
Monday evening.

Kornbluh spoke to promote 

his new book, “Back Channel 
to Cuba: The Hidden History 
of 
Negotiations 
between 

Washington 
and 
Havana,” 

which 
he 
co-wrote 
with 

William LeoGrande, professor 
of government at the American 
University School of Public 
Affairs. 
The 
event 
had 
a 

question and answer format 
moderated by Jesse Hoffnung-
Garskof, associate professor of 
history and American culture at 
the University of Michigan.

The book explores events 

during former President Bill 
Clinton’s administration, the 
CIA’s attempt to recruit Fidel 
Castro as an informant and 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

appearance 
on 
a 
Cuban 

television show. It also discusses 
secret 
political 
associations 

throughout the Cold War and 
the American embargo on Cuba.

“We have to be able to say it 

is not heresy to negotiate with 
the Cubans; every president 
since Kennedy has done it. Even 
Henry Kissinger and Gerald 
Ford 
wanted 
to 
normalize 

relations with Cubans — why 
can’t I?” he said. “And that was 

the history we wanted to put 
into place, to create a foundation 
for that argument.”

Kornbluh has traveled to 

Cuba several times with his 
work and interviewed many 
high-level figures, including the 
divisive former Cuban President 
Fidel Castro. For his book, 
Kornbluh also worked with 
The National Security Archive 
to help declassify documents 
and interviewed government 

officials on the significance of 
the documents.

“This is the best way, I think, 

to not only get to the heart of 
these events, but also to bring 
people together around it,” 
Kornbluh said.

He joked that many people 

accused him of having insider 
knowledge that Obama was 
planning to normalize relations 
with Cuba, as his book was 
released only a few months 

prior to Obama’s July 2015 
announcement.

“Everybody thought we were 

prescient, that we had known 
all along but were keeping the 
secret,” he said. “I had two 
reactions — one: damn, this is 
a timely book, and two: damn, 
I’m going to have to go back and 
rewrite it now.”

Hoffnung-Garskof 
said 

he thought the event was 

Though nicotine’s addictive 

qualities are the most obvious 
reason for why people use 
vaporizers, a recent study at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

found that for eighth, 10th and 
12th graders, the various flavor 
options are more enticing.

According to the U.S. Food and 

Drug Administration, vaporizers 
— or e-cigarettes — are battery-
powered 
devices 
generally 

designed to look like pens, 
often using a liquid containing 
nicotine in combination with a 
variety of flavors, glycerin and 
other ingredients to mimic a 
traditional smoking sensation.

Richard Miech, Institute for 

Social Research professor and 
lead author of the study, has 
previously 
conducted 
studies 

on adolescents and other drugs 
such as opioids. He said while the 
survey has traditionally asked 
students about gender and drugs, 
it now also asks about the role 
of government and the use of 50 
different substances. Questions 
about e-cigarettes, examining 
exactly which substances were 
being vaped, were added in 2013

On Monday, the University of 

Michigan released a new online 
tool for faculty and staff to report 
instances of sexual and gender-
based misconduct as defined 
under the University’s recent 
update to its sexual misconduct 
policy.

The University released a new 

version of its sexual assault policy 
on April 6, also renaming it “The 
University of Michigan Policy and 
Procedures on Student Sexual 
and Gender-Based Misconduct 
and Other Forms of Interpersonal 
Violence.” The new policy went 
into effect July 1. The updates 

revamped a 10-year-old document 
and included updates such as fine-
tuning the meaning of consent 
and streamlining sanctioning and 
appeals procedures.

The policy also holds most 

employees 
responsible 
for 

reporting known and suspected 
instances of sexual misconduct 
to the University to better comply 
with Title IX requirements.

Now, 
two 
months 
later, 

designated 
University-affiliated 

personnel will be able to log into 
an online platform to report 
misconduct 
in 
addition 
to 

receiving online training. Topics 
covered in the training include 
whether the requirement applies

Correspondent Molly Ball speaks at the 31st Graham Hovey Lecture, titled “Election 2016: The Great Disruption of American Politics” at Wallace House Monday. 

While giving the 31st annual 

Graham Hovey Lecture, Molly 
Ball, political correspondent for 
The Atlantic, discussed the 2016 
election — with an emphasis on 
the breakdown of both of the major 

parties. Ball was a fellow at the 
Knight-Wallace House, a sponsor 
of the event, in the 2009-2010 
academic year.

The Knight-Wallace Fellowship 

is a program at the University of 
Michigan that welcomes mid-
career journalists to the University 
for a year to study a topic of their 

choice. When Ball was a fellow, 
she focused on the economic crisis 
following the 2008 downturn and 
was invited to speak by Wallace 
House Director Lynette Clemetson, 
who formerly worked for NPR and 
was a fellow alongside Ball.

Her lecture, titled “Election 

2016: The Great Disruption of 

American Politics,” explored the 
ways in which this election has 
been unprecedented on both sides 
of the political sphere and will 
continue to influence the nature of 
national elections long after Nov. 8.

presidential 
election 

is a remarkable event; anything

FIRST REAL LECTURES.

Randall 
Jones, 
head 
of 

the Japan/Korea desk at the 
Organisation 
for 
Economic 

Co-operation and Development, 
spoke at the Ford School of 
Public Policy Friday about the 
challenges faced by policymakers 
when negotiating international 
economic agreements.

“When we at the OECD try 

to write policy that will benefit 
each nation, we stay away from 
a 
one-size-fits-all 
approach,” 

Jones said. “If something works 
in Canada, it may not necessarily 
work in Japan. At the same time, 
we do look for best practices. It 
sometimes may be the case that if 
a policy works in one place then it 
may work elsewhere too.”

In his lecture, Jones, who 

earned 
his 
master’s 
degree 

and Ph.D. from the University 
of Michigan in 1982 and 1984 
respectively, spoke about his role 
as a key negotiator and advocate 

for 
international 
free-market 

policies. His lecture focused on 
four key themes: rapidly aging 
demographics 
in 
Korea 
and 

Japan, weak productivity and 
growth since the 2008 financial 
crisis, high wealth inequality and 
relative poverty, and high levels 
of public debt.

Jones focused extensively on 

the issue of aging, specifically 
in Japan, which has the oldest 
population among OECD nations. 
The issue has created a heavy 
public pension burden on the 
working-age population.

“Japan, today, has the highest 

population dependency ratio and 
one of the lowest birth rates.” 
Jones said. “The country wants 
to raise its birthrate towards 
the OECD average. However, 
it is often the case that women 
in Japan will have no children 
because of the of the demands of 
work.”

One remedy Jones noted, aside 

from raising the birthrate in 
Korea and Japan, was to increase 

immigration 
rates 
to 
both 

countries — which is something 
Korea has embraced more than 
Japan in recent decades.

“In Japan, the government 

allows more skilled labor to 
immigrate, which means that 
there is a shortage of laborers, 
but in Korea there is a trainee 
program for unskilled labor that 
lasts for three years,” Jones said.

Along 
with 
immigration, 

Jones also discussed standard of 
living issues, including decrease 
in productivity as well as rising 
inequality and poverty.

In both Japan and Korea, 

Jones said, there is a decreasing 
level of industrial productivity 
and 
a 
low 
emphasis 
on 

entrepreneurship. 
This, 

according to Jones, has led to a 
rise in the number of “zombie 
firms” — corporations that fail 
to turn annual profits.

This growing concern over 

production 
has 
contributed 

to an overall lowering of the 
standard of living in both 
countries, he said, along with 
other factors like an increase 
in non-regular workers with 
temporary contracts in Korea, 
who can be paid significantly 
less 
than 
regular 
workers 

with long-term contracts. A 
glut of college educated adults 
entering the workforce has 
also been a factor.

“Many factories, including 

ones that I have visited in 
Korea, arbitrarily hire people 
on a non-regular basis,” Jones 
recalled. 
“The 
non-regular 

worker in Korea can sometimes 
make half as much as the 
regular worker. What we at 
the OECD want to achieve is 
a greater standardization of 
wages so that the non-regular 
worker would make more and 
the 
regular 
worker 
would 

make slightly less. This would 
decrease the level of wage 
inequality, 
and 
ultimately 

the poverty level among the 
Korean working class.”

A reduction of economic 

inequality, Jones said, was a 
main focus of the efforts of

Monday morning in the 

courtyard of the Art and 

Architecture Building, Art 

& Design Prof. Roland Graf’s 

Studio 3-D class completed their 

“Michigan Daily Habitat Project.” 

The goal of the project was to 

build an 11-foot-6-inch geodesic 

dome big enough to fit the entire 

class, using The Michigan Daily 

newspapers as their main supply.

Graf said the class’s goal 

was to start exploring the 

relationship between form, space 

and structure, as well as to learn 

the benefits of resourcefulness, 

precision and team spirit, which he 

said are some of the basic elements 

that will help the students succeed 

throughout the semester. He added 

that he wanted to use the project 

as a type of icebreaker so students 

could get to know each other.

“It helps me to get to know the 

students and for the students to get 

to know each other,” he said.

A geodesic dome is a 

hemispherical, thin-shelled 

structure. The American Institute 

of Architects defines the geodesic 

dome as “the strongest, lightest 

and most efficient means of 

enclosing space known to man.”

It is constructed of short 

struts following geodesic lines and 

forming an open framework of 

triangles or polygons. First created 

for the Zeiss Planetarium in 1922 

in Jena, Germany, the principles 

of its construction were further 

developed and popularized by 

Richard Buckminster Fuller, an 

American architect and engineer.

In constructing the dome, 

the class used 42 copies of The 

Michigan Daily. Each copy equaled 

six 24x21 sheets, with two sheets 

per strut for 250 struts total. 

They also used 91 brass fasteners. 

Graf said he only gave students a 

handout of the objective and they 

took it from there.

“They had to figure out how 

to organize it themselves in task 

forces,” he said. “It was really 

impressive actually. I’m happy 

with how the students took 

initiative.”

The structure overall was 

small, but large enough to fit the 

entire class.

“There are 18 students and 

they all fit in,” Graf said. “One of 

them said the dome is bigger than 

her dorm.”

Graf said overall he thought 

the class learned a lot about 

invisible perceptual forces around 

and between objects.

“It’s a great class,” Graf said. “I 

am glad this little welcome worked 

out so well. I also liked how they 

got their hands on The Michigan 

Daily.”

disruptive technology that could 
benefit from Mcity.”

Zendrive — a company that 

utilizes smartphone sensors to 
understand 
driving 
behavior 

— was the first to announce its 
plans to work with TechLab. 
Zendrive supervised four UM 
undergraduate students last year 
and hosted two of those interns, at 
a summer internship at TechLab.

Morton said she hopes students 

will have a similarly positive and 
rewarding experience interning 
for Civil Maps and PolySync.

“They 
have 
been 
thrilled 

with the progress the students 
have made in regards to solving 
technology 
challenges 
the 

company faces,” Morton said of 
Zendrive. “The students have 
really relished the experience 
of 
working 
in 
a 
startup 

environment.”

Engineering senior Ziqi Guo 

and Engineering junior Mohan 
Kothari, the two summer interns 
with Zendrive, said they acquired 
valuable skills while assisting 
the company in developing and 
improving their technology.

Kothari 
said 
he 
became 

involved with Zendrive because 
of his interest in the technology 
of 
autonomous 
vehicles 
and 

desire to work at a startup, 
ultimately working on a main 
project 
to 
enhance 
machine 

learning algorithms to analyze 
the behavior of drivers in regard 
to hard braking.

“I learned a ton, everything 

from 
scaling 
a 
company 
to 

acquiring 
customers, 
building 

strategic relationships and signal 
processing, just to name a few,” 
Kothari said. “I definitely hope 
to work with TechLab for a long 
time to come.”

Guo said his main task over the 

summer was developing a media 
detector and data set to evaluate 
whether a driver makes a hard 
turn or not, adding that he was 
considering working for Zendrive 
in the future.

“After 
graduation, 
it 
is 

very possible that I will join 
Zendrive,” he said. “I am really 
passionate about their mission, 
which is to make the roads safer 
through an infrastructure that is 
already developed, which is the 
smartphone.”

One of the new startups 

coming to TechLab is Civil Maps, 
a 3-D mapping company utilizing 
localization technology, artificial 
intelligence 
and 
augmented 

reality to improve the safety 
and efficiency of self-driving 
cars. 
Richard 
Hurlock, 
Civil 

Maps vice president of business 
strategy and development, said 
the environment of Mcity — and 
the infamous cold winters of 

Michigan — will be conducive to 
the improvement of the mapping 
technology.

“We believe that for truly 

autonomous vehicles to provide 
a safe and comfortable ride, they 
have to work everywhere, under 
every 
possible 
combination 

of conditions,” Hurlock said. 
“Testing at the Mcity facility 
under those extreme conditions 
will inform our efforts to further 
strengthen the capabilities and 
performance of our technologies.”

Morton said one unique aspect 

of TechLab is the involvement 
of a large network including 
insurance 
companies 
and 

infrastructure providers.

“We 
create 
a 
real 
world 

laboratory where we can learn 
about legal implications, private 
security challenges and all other 
societal impacts,” she said. “We 
can learn about the potential 
impact of the technology on the 
reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions and fuel consumption.”

Hurlock 
said 
Civil 
Maps 

is 
looking 
forward 
to 
the 

opportunity of working with the 
two other West Coast startups.

“We look forward to learning 

more 
about 
Zendrive 
and 

PolySync through the program,” 
he 
said. 
“If 
their 
products 

complement our crowdsourced, 
dynamic 3-D mapping technology, 
we’ll certainly explore options for 
working together.”

The third startup, PolySync, 

developed an operating system 
that allows software code writers 
to enable vehicles to perform 
more functions independently. 
Like Zendrive and Civil Maps, 
PolySync is enthusiastic about 
receiving input from UM students. 
Peter Brink, PolySync’s director 
of engineering, said while the 
students benefit from TechLab, 
the company also benefits from 
receiving the outside perspective 
of students who often offer 
valuable 
insights, 
potentially 

leading to innovation.

“We 
get 
students 
who 

know how to do software and 
systems 
engineering,” 
Brink 

said. “Students get a practical or 
empirical background in terms 
of what constitutes everyday 
engineering as opposed to what 
you might get out of just an 
academic context.”

As Mcity and TechLab move 

forward, 
Morton 
said 
there 

are still some major hurdles to 
overcome 
before 
autonomous 

vehicles can hit the roads and the 
work of PolySync, Zendrive and 
Civil Maps can be implemented.

“Some of the largest obstacles 

are the cost of the sensors that are 
on our current vehicles,” Morton 
said. “Also understanding the 
validation of the technology so 
we know that our cars are safe 
enough. We need to be critical to 
putting them on the roadway.”

as inappropriate conduct, how 
to 
share 
information 
with 

the University and how to 
appropriately respond to and 
support students who privately 
want to disclose instances of 
misconduct.

According to a press release, 

the main goal of this training 
and online tool is to make it 
clear to University employees 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
are 

required to report sexual and 
gender-based 
misconduct 

under the policy.

Drop-in Q&A sessions will 

also be available on Sept. 16, 
Sept. 29 and Oct. 4 in various 
areas around campus.

According to the University, 

employees required to report 
include 
regents, 
executive 

officers, associate or assistant 
vice presidents and provosts, 
deans, directors, department 
heads and chairs (including 
interim, assistant, or associate 
heads and chairs), graduate 
and undergraduate chairs, and 
supervisors of employees who 
are not student employees or 
postdoctoral employees. 

New regulations for campus 

security 
authorities 
are 

also included as responsible 
employees in the new sexual 
misconduct 
guidelines, 
to 

align better with the Clery Act. 
The guidelines also designate 
advisers 
to 
University-

recognized 
student 
groups 

and all individuals working 
in the Student Life Division, 
the Division of Public Safety 

and Security, Intercollegiate 
Athletics 
and 
the 
Office 

for 
Institutional 
Equity 
as 

responsible employees.

Employees 
who 
handle 

confidential

private 

information are exempt from 
the 
reporting 
requirement, 

including 
employees 
of

Center.

“Creating a safe and inclusive 

environment at U-M is the 

responsibility of all members 
of our campus community,” 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel wrote in a press 
release. 
“By 
understanding 

how the university responds 
to sexual and gender-based 
misconduct and interpersonal 
violence — and the role each of us 
has — together we can continue 
to create an environment that is 
safe for all.”

that happens every four years is 
going to be news, but this one feels 
different,” Ball said. “I thought I 
knew everything about American 
politics and then this election 
came along and showed me how 
much I didn’t know. I learned so 
much about America — not all 
happy things — but it’s a hell of a 
story.”

Ball began by discussing the 

more obvious division found in 
the Republican Party following 
the nomination of Donald Trump 
— pointing toward the ways in 
which his platform differs from 
traditional GOP values. Where 
Republicans have historically been 
in favor of free trade and small 
government, the nominee has 
consistently beset trade deals such 
as the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
and favors policies that would 
expand the reach of the federal 
government. 
Though 
Trump’s 

rise has been a blatant example of 
the division, Ball said through her 
career in political journalism she 
has witnessed this change within 
the party.

“I, too, like my Republican 

friends, thought this was a battle 
of ideas and I’m now coming to 
believe it’s a battle of identity,” 
Ball said. “On the other hand, the 
Republican Party was already 
broken when Trump came along. 
I like to think of myself as a war 
correspondent: I’ve been covering 
the Republican Civil War since 
2010.”

Ball continued citing her time 

as a reporter, stating that along 
with the rise of the Tea Party, 
there have been other divisions 
within the Republican Party long 
before the emergence of Trump.

According to Ball, though, 

the 
GOP 
isn’t 
alone: 
The 

Democrats are also in the midst 
of an ideological divide. Pointing 
toward the unexpected success of 
the Bernie Sanders campaign, Ball 
highlighted the changes the party 
has experienced this election.

“The way I shorthand it — this 

isn’t a partisan statement; all of the 
Republicans I’ve talked to agreed 
with this — the Democrats moved 
to the center and the Republicans 
went nuts,” Ball said.

The movement toward the 

center was reflected in the issues 
the Democratic Party campaigns 
focused 
on 
throughout 
the 

primaries and into the general 

election, which differ from what 
the party has traditionally run on.

“The 
Democrats 
stopped 

talking about divisive cultural 
and class issues,” Ball said. “They 
stopped campaigning on taxing 
the rich and abortions for all, and 
they started talking about things 
like education and public safety.”

This shift isn’t true of the 

Republican 
party. 
While 
80 

percent 
of 
Republicans 
call 

themselves 
conservatives, 

according to Ball, only a small 
margin of Democrats refer to 
themselves as liberals. Ball said the 
millennial generation is perhaps 
the most liberal generation ever in 
the United States.

“A lot of these kids don’t see 

themselves as Democrats,” Ball 
said. “A lot of the supporters 
of Bernie Sanders were young 
people and a lot of them were 
political Independents. So there’s 
a potential time bomb for the 
Democratic Party if these young 
people decide the party has 
overlooked them and ignored their 
voices.”

This election, the movement 

was not large enough to make it 
to the White House, as shown 
through 
the 
unsuccessful 

Sanders campaign. Unlike the 

Republicans, 
Ball 
said, 
the 

Democratic establishment elected 
the candidate. In an interview 
after the event, Ball said though 
the youth vote impacted the 
primaries, it’s hard to tell how 
much of an impact it will have on 
the general election.

“Barack Obama’s enthusiasm 

among 
young 
voters 
was 

something he was able to carry 
on into the general election,” Ball 
said. “Now we have a Democratic 
candidate (who) did not have 
enthusiasm with young voters 
in the primary and there’s a real 
question about whether she can 
carry it into the general election.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, who attended the event 
and gave the opening remarks, 
told the Daily he was happy to 
have Ball back on campus just 
eight weeks before the election 
and frequently reads her work in 
The Atlantic.

“I think she’s inspiring for our 

community, but she’s a young 
person who’s gotten herself in 
a position where she can write 
about interesting and important 
things and has developed a great 
audience — certainly around the 
time of the election,” Schlissel 
said.

due to their increasing prevalence.

Miech said he expected to 

find most students vaped due to 
an addiction to the drug, given 
the perception of e-cigarettes 
as a device to deliver nicotine. 
Instead, he found that roughly 
60 percent of students who had 
ever vaped reported vaping “just 
flavoring” without nicotine.

“The percentage that vaped 

non-nicotine, 
just 
flavoring, 

was the same pretty much in all 
the grades,” Miech said. “The 
percentage that vaped nicotine 
went up between eighth, 10th and 
12th grade as you would expect. 
But that’s difficult to interpret, 
because you might be tempted 
to think as they get older, people 
start with vaping non-nicotine, 
and then by 12th grade, they’ve 
switched over to nicotine. But it 
could very well be … that by 12th 
grade, a new group of people come 
in that were smoking cigarettes or 
whatever, and they didn’t vape in 
eighth and 10th grade, but they 
started vaping in 12th grade.”

E-cigarettes 
have 
become 

exponentially more popular each 
year since their introduction to 
the market in 2003. As of 2015, 16 
percent of high school students, 
and just over 5 percent of middle 
school students used e-cigarettes, 
according to the FDA.

SInce 
their 
introduction, 

there has been significant debate 
surrounding vaping over the 
balance between the potential 
benefits it could have on smoking 
cessation, versus the potential for 
negative health effects and the 
encouragement of behavior very 
similar to smoking. Additionally, 

researchers 
and 
policymakers 

have raised concerns about the 
regulation and sale of e-cigarettes.

This concern was amplified 

after the 2015 National Youth 
Tobacco Survey, conducted by 
the FDA, found that the use 
of 
e-cigarettes 
and 
hookah 

was increasing while the use 
of 
traditional 
cigarettes 
was 

decreasing. 
These 
results 

ultimately prompted the FDA 
to move to regulate e-cigarettes 
in the same way traditional 
cigarettes 
are 
regulated, 

instituting rules that went into 
effect last May.

The recent University study, 

which used data from the 2015 
Monitoring the Future Survey 
— a nationally representative 
survey sponsored by the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse and 
administered by the University – 
found that no matter the flavor, it 
was the taste encouraging eighth, 
10th and 12th graders to vape 
more so than the nicotine.

Joey Wylie, an employee of 

the Ann Arbor store Bongz & 
Thongz, which sells vaporizers, 
said he was surprised by the study 
results for a number of reasons, 
but particularly the age of the 
respondents.

“That’s pretty young, first off,” 

Wylie said. “For flavor, I can see 
that it would be popular for such 
young smokers. I don’t know how 
many of them are really smoking 
because 
it’s 
probably 
pretty 

difficult for them to get their 
hands on it for the most part.”

Miech said for young people, a 

culture now exists surrounding 
vaping as a hobby.

“There seems to be this kind of 

youth culture that seems to enjoy 
vaping not so much to get a hit of 
nicotine, but more to do smoke 

tricks and be part of a crowd of 
some type,” he said.

Currently the consequences 

are of vaping non-nicotine vapor 
into the lungs are unknown 
due to a lack of long-term data 
on the topic. Miech said he 
believes it has to be less harmful 
than traditional cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes containing nicotine.

“Cigarette 
smoke 
has 
at 

least 100 known carcinogenic 
chemicals in it, whereas vaping 
is mostly propylene glycol, so it’s 
not a known carcinogen, which 
makes me think it would be much 
harder to establish the contents 
of nicotine-free vaping vapor as 
harmful,” Miech said.

Wylie said while he has been 

working at the shop, he has 
encountered 
mostly 
college 

freshmen, though upperclassmen 
vape as well. He added that he 
thinks that if people are going 
to smoke, vaping is better than 
traditional cigarettes due to the 
ingredients used.

“If they enjoy smoking, it’s a 

safer alternative,” he said.

Overall, when it comes to 

regulation, Miech said he believes 
the same strategies used for 
preventing smoking traditional 
cigarettes are not as effective for 
e-cigarettes and vaping.

“I think a more strategic and 

potentially fruitful line of attack 
for those who are interested 
in such things is to say, maybe 
vaping is a risk factor for future 
smoking, regardless of what it is 
they’re vaping,” he said. “Even 
if they are not vaping nicotine, 
it could be that when you start 
vaping, it teaches you how to 
smoke. Vaporizers could very well 
serve as a device that desensitizes 
people to the dangers of smoking.”

successful, especially given the 
amount of people who attended. 
The crowd was made up of 
graduate students, faculty, Ann 
Arbor community members and 
students.

He added that as a facilitator, 

his goal was to allow Kornbluh 

to share all his stories.

“In my experience, the trick to 

these things is to ask interesting 
questions and then shut up, 
because usually somebody who 
wrote a really good book is going 
to be really good at telling those 
same stories,” he said. “Pick 
out some stories that you know 
the audience would like to hear 
and ask questions that lead the 
author to tell those stories.”

LSA junior Jack Hibbard 

said the talk was especially 
interesting for him in the context 
of his study abroad experience 
this summer in Cuba.

“I just think there was a lot 

of interesting content,” he said. 
“There was some stuff I would 
have liked to hear a little more 
about, but it was a really good 
overview of the history.”

Meaningful dissent

MAX 
LUBELL

O

n Aug. 4, Ann Arbor passed 
an ordinance banning the 
sale of tobacco products 

to people under 
the age of 21, 
becoming 
the 

first 
city 
in 

Michigan 
to 

join the national 
tobacco 
21 

movement. The purpose of such 
laws is to make it more difficult 
for teenagers to smoke cigarettes, 
decreasing the chance of addiction 
and therefore saving lives. The 
ordinance, which passed in a 
9-to-2 vote, came after a debate 
over whether such a law would 
be legitimate under state law. 
The Michigan Tobacco Products 
Tax Act of 1993 states that “a city 
… (or) local unit of government … 
of this state shall not impose any 
new requirement or prohibition 
pertaining 
to 
the 
sale 
or 

licensure of tobacco products for 
distribution purposes.”

I believe the local ordinance 

does in fact conflict with the 
state tobacco policy. This is a 
similar opinion shared by several 
councilmembers who voted for 
the ordinance. However, City 
Council members who believe 
the ordinance violates the state 
law still voted to pass the law. But 
I’m not going to attempt to argue 
whether the local ordinance 
does or does not conflict with 
the state tobacco policy. Rather, 
I wish to answer the question 
of why a City Council member 
would vote to pass legislation 
if they believed it violated the 
state law.

The 
council 
members 
are 

imposing a strategy that will 
attempt 
to 
create 
a 
positive 

change, even if the ordinance 
is 
ineffective. 
After 
all, 
the 

legislation on the surface seems 
to be pretty ineffective and a 
little pointless. There is nothing 
to 
stop 
a 
19-year-old 
from 

driving one town over to buy a 
pack of cigarettes. However, the 
passage of local legislation that 
conflicts with state legislation 
is an effective strategy to refute 

unethical state laws.

Attempting to create positive 

change on the state level appears to 
be the basis for several City Council 
members’ reasoning when passing 
the ordinance. Councilmember 
Chuck 
Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 

5) believes a positive change 
is worth challenging the state 
legislation, even if it goes to the 
courts, stating, “It’s an untested 
area in the state of Michigan. 
But as an untested one, I think 
the opportunity to save lives is 
worth taking a leadership role and 
pushing for better legislation.”

Warpehoski 
reveals 
a 

reasonable strategy for creating 
the ordinance: trusting the courts. 
As an untested area in the state 
law, the ordinance’s functionality 
will likely be decided in the courts. 
In the event that a state court 
decides the local ordinance does 
not conflict with the state legal 
code, then the city has created a 
positive change for its residents. 
Furthermore, it will create a 
precedent that will allow other 
local governments to pass similar 
laws. Even if the courts do not 
rule in the city’s favor, there could 
be a positive impact by creating 
pressure at the state level.

There are two main reasons 

why passing the ordinance is an 
effective strategy, even if the 
courts will rule it as illegitimate. 
First, it draws attention to the 
unethical state law, creating a 
public consciousness. If the law 
is truly unethical, the public will 
get on board and also oppose 
the law, creating pressure for 
change. Secondly, the passage of 
conflicting legislation creates a 
symbolic message, portraying a 
population that dissents from state 
rulings and is willing to reject 
them. A discussion over that law, 
which may never have occurred 
without such dissent, is forced to 
begin on the state level. Both are 
explanations of how Ann Arbor is 
creating momentum throughout 
the state to create a change to our 
state tobacco laws.

Even if the momentum built 

does not create change to our state 

laws, there is still a benefit to the 
city’s defiance. Even if nothing is 
changed, the local government is 
able to stand by their ethicality in 
rejecting the state law. The local 
government symbolically portrays 
that they want no part to play 
following a legal system that they 
deem problematic. It signifies that 
the local government, while legally 
forced to follow the state laws, 
does not want to simply stand by 
without voicing their discontent 
with their state’s policies.

While Ann Arbor’s strategy may 

seem beneficial in dissenting from 
state laws they deem unethical, it 
is not a strategy that is reserved 
for progressive policies. After all, 
the reason Ann Arbor’s stance is 
courageous and beneficial may 
simply be because it is being used 
for a progressive policy proposal. 
However, that is not always going 
to be the case.

For 
example, 
a 
local 

government could be filled with 
people who oppose same-sex 
marriage. That government could 
try to send a political message by 
passing an ordinance banning it 
in their city. The ordinance would 
obviously be deemed illegitimate 
by the federal court system, 
but the local government still 
succeeded in sending a political 
symbol of their dissent from the 
progressive federal policy. So 
perhaps we should be wary of this 
strategy of local politics. It sends 
a message to the top, but it could 
have poor consequences if local 
governments 
start 
dissenting 

from any law they see as standing 
against their specific government 
official’s ethical code.

Creating 
local 
laws 
that 

conflict with unethical state or 
federal laws is a good strategy 
for changing those laws, but that 
strategy may not always be great. 
It is a strategy that can be used 
by any local government, whether 
they are backing a progressive 
ethicality or one that seems to 
move us backward.

D

octor. Surgeon. Genius. Einstein. 
These are the labels by which my 
family defines me.

I am obviously not a doctor nor a surgeon, 

not a genius nor an Einstein, but every day 
when I wake up, it’s a day trying to live up to 
these expectations; it’s a day living the life 
of a first-generation college student from 
an immigrant family trying to make every 
moment on this campus worth it for not just 
me, but for my family.

In 1973, my now-late grandfather came to 

the United States for the first time. Leaving 
his seven children and my grandmother, 
he came here alone in search of a new 
opportunity. Just 11 years later, in 1984, 
my father and the remainder of his family 
followed, escaping a war that tore our 
country of Lebanon apart. The Lebanese 
Civil War lasted from 1975 to 1990, with an 
estimated 150,000 people killed and more 
than 1 million (a quarter of the population) 
were displaced. My family was a part of that 
1 million.

When my father and his dad came to the 

United States, they knew nothing about 
being in this country. They did not know 
how to read street signs. With a lack of 
mosques, there were no places for them 
to worship Islam, and with no internet 
(or Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram), 
they could not communicate easily back 
home with family. Being in the United 
States was a hard life to live, but they did 
know, however, that they were in a place 
of opportunity, jobs, education and safety, 
and future generations of our family would 
have a better life because of their move. Fast 
forward 32 years later and here I am as a 
student at one of the best universities in the 
world, the University of Michigan.

My acceptance into U of M is the reason 

why my family thinks I am a genius. My two 
older brothers matriculated at U of M before 
me and our education is something never 
believed to be possible and never before 
done by people in our family. My father and 
his siblings did not attend a university and 
the degrees we get from here are pieces of 
paper that mean more than the world to 
those who are supporting us. This is why 
when I go home they call me a “doctor” 
before I have even taken the MCAT, and 
it is why my mom’s father walks around 
Dearborn showing people that I was one of 
the Students of the Year.

To my family, this education is foreign 

and unique, and it means that every 
backbreaking 
job 
they 
worked, 
every 

hardship they have endured, every tear they 
have shed and every dollar they have earned 

has paid off. For me this life of campus 
chaos is easy. This life of everyday tiring 
educational work is nothing compared to 
watching what my family had to do to get 
me where I am today — my success and work 
is worth every moment of over-exhaustion, 
fatigue and hard work. This is my way 
to thank my family, to make them proud, 
to live up to their expectations and to let 
them know that for every challenge they 
faced, I made a move to better my world, my 
surroundings and my future, and they did 
nothing in vain.

Our story, our background and our 

past have motivated my family to create 
the Ahmad K. Jawad Scholarship for 
Community Service and Social Action 
through the Edward Ginsberg Center for 
Community Service and Learning. When 
I was a freshman, I was awarded a similar 
scholarship through the Ginsberg Center, 
which required a one-year term of service 
to the Ginsberg Student Advisory Board 
and also provided me with $1,000 that 
allowed me to work less hours for pay, 
and spend more hours on developing my 
service and community engagement. I am 
now entering my third year on the board, 
not by requirement to my scholarship, 
but by volunteer, because this leadership 
role has defined me and my time here at 
this University. My family and I hold our 
education and donation to the highest 
regard, and this award is a gift to education, 
as there is no better way to remember 
my grandpa’s memory than in his and 
my family’s determination to educate 
successive generations.

My family has established the Ahmad 

K. Jawad Community Service Scholarship 
Fund in honor of my grandpa, Ahmad, 
who brought our family here to make huge 
strides like the ones I am making today; he 
came to the United States with a vision of a 
better future through education and giving 
for others. This year, one $1,000 scholarship 
will be awarded to support a first-generation 
University of Michigan student who gives a 
commitment to community service or social 
action and who demonstrates financial 
need. I hope this story and this scholarship 
will give someone the opportunity I was so 
fortunate to have have had during my first 
month at the University.

I write this in loving memory of Ahmad 

K. Jawad, my grandpa whom my family and 
I miss daily, but whose memory will never 
be lost nor forgotten.

Survivors Speak: Submit to our series

O

ver the past few years, 
both 
students 
and 

administrators 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
have 

addressed campus sexual assault 
through new policies and ongoing 
campus activism — but amid all 
this focus, at times the personal 
stories of individuals who have 
survived an assault can be lost in 
the bigger discussion. With that 
in mind, the Opinion section is 
creating a space in The Michigan 
Daily for first-person accounts 
of campus sexual assault and 
its 
corresponding 
personal, 

academic and legal implications. 
Submissions will be published as 
a series of personal accounts that 
show an essential perspective: 
that of the survivor.

Submissions:
This series is open to University 

students who have experienced 
sexual assault and would like to 
share their statements as part of 
a first-person series. If you have 
experienced assault and would like 
to participate in the University’s 
and the nation’s conversation 
surrounding the issue, we are here 
to include your perspective.

This 
series 
centers 
on 
the 

implications of sexual assault — 
what happens in the days and 
weeks afterward and what it means 
to be a survivor of sexual assault as 
a student and as a member of the 
University’s campus community. 
You may want to include specific 
details about the assault in your 
piece if they are relevant to your 
narrative, but keep in mind that the 
focus of this series is the effects of 
assault. We will accept submissions 

from 
survivors 
regardless 
of 

whether you have reported the 
assault, and the series is open to 
all students and recently graduated 
alumni 
— 
undergraduates 
and 

graduates — of all gender identities. 
Pieces do not need to be about 
an experience that began on the 
University’s campus.

This series also takes on 

the understanding that sexual 
assault cases are not all black and 
white, and is open to submissions 
regardless of the outcome of a 
University or court case. We 
will read your piece without 
judgment or assumptions about 
guilt. If your case has gone 
through the University or police 
system, and you reference details 
from that experience in your 
piece, we will ask you to provide 
documentation as part of the 
Daily’s fact-checking protocol.

Overall, we are seeking to 

provide a space for students who 
may or may not have previously 
had an outlet to share their 
stories and to provide a nuanced 
statement 
on 
campus 
sexual 

assault to the Daily’s audience, 
UM students and fellow survivors.

Format requirements:
We aim to give survivors 

a 
space 
to 
freely 
express 

themselves and therefore will 
accept submissions that follow 
a range of writing styles and 
formats. Submissions should not 
exceed 1,000 words in length, 
and may be submitted as an 
op-ed, personal essay, letter or 
poem.

We 
will 
not 
be 
accepting 

anonymous submissions because 

the aim of this series is to help 
create a campus where students 
can speak openly about sexual 
assault without being shamed or 
stigmatized. We do not guarantee 
publication of each piece we 
receive. 
Everything 
published 

in the Opinion section must 
follow the Daily’s style rules and 
standards for factual accuracy, 
and we reserve the right to alter 
wording when necessary to uphold 
those standards. If your piece is 
selected for publication, you will 
be involved in our editing process.

*If you would like to submit 

a piece about sexual assault but 
are not a survivor yourself, we 
highly encourage you to submit it 
as an op-ed to the Opinion section 
by emailing it to tothedaily@

Heart of ‘Morris’ can 
triumph over flaws

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

If “Morris From America” is 

anything, it’s charming. With 
a palette swathed in colors 
reminiscent 
of 
an 
Ikea 

showroom, 
the 
coming-

of-age 
film 

follows 
thir-

teen-year-old 
Morris (new-
comer 
Markees 

Christmas) 
and his father, 
Curtis 
(Craig 

Robinson, 
“Hot Tub Time Machine”) as 
they navigate life as expats in 
Heidelberg, Germany.

Christmas plays the titular 

Morris with a subtlety rarely 
found in child actors. He lets the 
audience in on the innate contra-
dictions of adolescence — in one 
moment, he can be both insight-
ful and clueless, confident and 
confused.

At the prompting of his Ger-

man tutor (Carla Juri, “Wet-
lands”), Morris joins the local 
youth center, where he meets 
Katrin (newcomer Lina Keller), 
an older girl who befriends Mor-
ris seemingly just to bully him. 
Morris’s futile pursuit of Katrin 
is the center point around which 
the film is grounded. Unlike 
the average coming-of-age film, 
Morris doesn’t get the girl and 
the movie benefits because of it.

While Katrin shares the most 

screen time with Morris, it’s the 

relationship 
between 
Morris 

and his father that’s the rich-
est and most appealing. The 
film opens with the two argu-
ing about the necessity of a hook 
in a rap song. They disagree on 
almost everything from flow to 
curfew, but at the end of the day 
they need each other with an 
intensity unmatched in the rest 
of the film. Morris wants Katrin, 
but needs Curtis.

What Hartigan does a won-

derful job of illustrating is the 
symmetry of their two lives. 
Both are shot from the same 
angle, sitting alone at the dining 
room table — Morris with a pea-
nut butter, jelly and potato chip 
sandwich and a porn magazine, 
and Curtis with a steak and an 
imaginary conversation with his 
dead wife. The two scenes work 
in tandem because they high-
light the deep loneliness and 
sense of isolation that color both 
characters’ lives. Through mag-
azines and imagination, both 
men are desperate for human 
connection. The irony (and, 
sadly, the realism) comes in the 
fact that despite their despera-
tion, they cannot connect with 
one another.

Life is hard for a kid from the 

Bronx trying to tackle adoles-
cence in Heidelberg. And Har-
tigan does not shy away from 
addressing the day-to-day rac-
ism that Morris has to put up 
with. He’s constantly fielding 
questions about his basketball 
skills, possible drug trafficking 
and sexual promiscuity (at the 
ripe age of thirteen when sex 

is so, so painful to talk about). 
These moments help solidify not 
only the reality of small-town 
Germany, but also the degree to 
which Morris is unlike anyone 
else around him. And how that 
difference is the root of much 
of his, and most likely also his 
father’s, loneliness. At the end of 
the day, he and his father are, as 
Curtis puts it, “the only brothers 
in Heidelberg.”

“Morris From America” is 

almost perfect. There’s heart 
and there’s charm and just 
enough edge. But it fails to find 
the type of resolution you’d 
expect. Morris and Curtis end 
the film just as alone, just as 
adrift as they were at the start. 
It’s realistic, perhaps, that mon-
umental change cannot be made 
in 90 minutes of storytelling, but 
it makes the billing of the film as 
a coming-of-age movie hard to 
fully believe. Morris is the right 
age to “come of age,” but it’s hard 
to tell if he really does.

Steeped with loneliness and 

pulsating with heart and hip hop, 
“Morris From America,” despite 
its shortcomings, is a beautiful 
testament to the heartbreaking 
weight of adolescence.

Yeah, they want it back to back.

or the past two sum-
mers, I’ve worked at a 
month-long arts camp 

for kids from six to fifteen-
years-old in NYC. That’s a 
wide range that encompasses 
different learning styles, sens-
es of humor and educational 
backgrounds, so each year 
when we take the kids to a 
show the camp always tries to 
pick something that the older 
kids will like, but won’t be 
too complicated for the little 
ones to understand. This year, 
we saw “School of Rock” on 
Broadway.

I hadn’t seen the movie 

“School of Rock” in several 
years, but it was a staple in my 
household when my brothers 
and I were little. For anyone 
unfamiliar with it, here’s the 
basic plot: Dewey, a couch 
potato who moonlights as a 
musician, is kicked out of his 
band while living in the apart-
ment of his tweedy friend Ned 
and Ned’s girlfriend, Patty. 
The latter, sick of Dewey’s 
bullshit — he doesn’t pay rent, 
doesn’t clean up after himself, 
is a bad influence on Ned, is 
generally aimless and annoy-
ing — tells him to find some 
rent money or get out. Desper-
ate, Dewey takes a job meant 
for Ned as a substitute teacher 
at a prep school for kids, 
teaches them how to play rock 
music and kidnaps them to 
perform at Battle of the Bands, 
having used the power of Ste-
vie Nicks’s music (and beer) to 
manipulate the principal into 
saying yes to that “field trip.”

When all the prep school 

parents storm the school, they 
discover all their children are 
at Battle of the Bands with 
Dewey, after Dewey tells them 
how great their kids are. The 
sappy moral lesson is that 
sometimes adults don’t listen 
to their kids and project their 
own priorities and desires onto 
children. But there’s a second 
lesson I realized that a whole 
generation walked away with, 
while I watched the story 
unfold on a Broadway stage.

And it’s about 

The Girlfriend.
The worst part about 

“School of Rock” was the 
depiction of Patty, Ned’s girl-
friend. The trope of the nag-
ging wife is ubiquitous and 
one of the most easily glanced 
over. The one joke of the entire 
show that got the biggest 
laugh from the kids was when 
Ned, who went to Battle of 
the Bands to support Dewey, 
rounds on Patty and tells her 
loudly, in a voice full of frus-
tration, to “Shut UP!”

There was a laugh break 

lasting almost a minute. It’s 
the ultimate PG “bros before 
hos” moment. And I get it — 
Patty is annoying, and a bit of 
a control freak. But she’s also 
right. Dewey has been exploit-
ing his friendship with Ned for 
who knows how long, and thus 
mooching off Patty. Dewey is 
the one in the wrong here, and 
in any real-life scenario, it’d 
be easier to see. Yet, the audi-
ence is led to sympathize with 

Dewey and gleefully hate Patty 
in every scene they share.

There were a few jokes that 

were packaged as commentary 
on the status of women in the 
music industry, or women in 
general, but they didn’t go over 
well. They were quick and the 
kids I was sitting with didn’t 
pick up on them. For example, 
there was a joke about women 
only making 75 cents to every 
dollar a man makes — but 
none of the kids from my camp 
group laughed. Not even the 
older kids understood the 
reference — I know, because I 
talked to them about it after-
wards. There were a few jokes 
that the kids did laugh at; 
when Dewey asks the students 
what the point of rock is, one 
kid quips “to get chicks” and 
Dewey agrees before remem-
bering that that’s not exactly 

the point he’s trying to make 
at that time. One girl refuses 
to be a groupie because she 
googled them and found out 
they are “sluts” who sleep with 
the band. (“Slut” is an ugly 
word to hear out of the mouths 
of middle school girls, espe-
cially in that context when it 
was so unnecessary, but that’s 
almost another article on its 
own.)

The best scenes in Broad-

way’s “School of Rock” by 
far are the group numbers 
in which all of the kids sing 
together, either about loving 
music, “sticking it to the man,” 
or about how their parents 
don’t listen to them. The script 
and score aren’t particularly 
strong, but that makes sense 
given the source material.

I’m not saying that “School 

of Rock” doesn’t have some 
good messages; I’m glad we 
took the kids to see it. But the 
writers had a chance to create 
a more nuanced character in 
Patty for the sake of the little 
girls on the stage and in the 
audience, and they didn’t — 
and that would have meant 
much more and had a much 
deeper effect than the throw-
away quips about the wage 
gap. Kids aren’t necessarily 
educated about the wage gap; 
it’s not something you can pick 
up on on your own. That’s why 
there are still people who deny 
its existence.

But the kinds of tropes that 

the character of Patty embod-
ies saturate our media. We 
can’t get away from them, 
and we absorb and internal-
ize them from a young age. 
And yes, women can be just 
as annoying as men — I’m not 
here to claim that any criti-
cism of a female character is 
an attack on women. But you 
do have to wonder about the 
speed and depth of internal-
ized stereotypes about men 
and women when a bunch of 
five-year-olds laugh harder at 
a man telling a woman to shut 
up than anything else in an 
entire show.

GENDER & MEDIA COLUMN

A field trip lacking 

in feminism

The ultimate 

PG “bros before 

hos” moment

The University of Michigan’s 

Senate Advisory Committee on 
University 
Affairs 
convened 

Monday to discuss a lack of 
faculty 
engagement 
at 
the 

University of Michigan-Flint, 
and hear from UM-Flint faculty.

Jerry 
Sanders, 
UM-Flint 

associate professor of biology, 
said due to the lack of a faculty 
governance body, issues related 
to academics are often deferred 

to administrators.

“Unfortunately, 
for 
many 

years, 
support 
for 
faculty 

governance was very limited,” 
Sanders. “This has led to a 
culture where the benefits of 
faculty governance are not well 
known, and it is not practiced.”

Sanders noted there was once 

a faculty senate at UM-Flint, 
but it was disbanded several 
years ago. The absence of a 
governing body, he said, has 
resulted in power struggles 
between 
department 
heads, 

deans and faculty members, 

as well as a lack of professor 
involvement in policymaking 
on campus.

Quamrul 
Mazumder, 

UM-Flint associate professor 
of mechanical engineering, told 
the body that administrators 
often dismiss faculty concerns 
as non-grievable offenses.

“The 
divisive 
culture 

of 
powerlessness 
has 
led 

to 
widespread 
faculty 

disengagement,” 
Mazumder 

said.

The 
representatives 
from 

UM-Flint, 
after 
addressing 

the problems on their campus, 
offered up several potential 
remedies to the committee.

Sarah Lippert, an associate 

professor of art history at 
UM-Flint, said the current 
UM-Flint Campus Chancellor, 
Susan Borrego, and Provost 
Douglas Knerr have been far 
more cooperative than their 
predecessors on the issue of 
faculty governance and input.

“For the first time that many 

folks on campus can remember, 
we have a provost and a 
chancellor that are willing to 

work with us,” Lippert said.

Lippert asked for faculty from 

the University’s Ann Arbor and 
Flint campuses open a dialogue 
with the provost and chancellor 
at UM-Flint on the best way 
to handle faculty grievances 
and manage disputes between 
faculty, department chairs and 
deans.

In response, SACUA member 

John Lehman, professor of 
ecology 
and 
evolutionary 

biology at the University’s Ann 
Arbor campus, suggested that 
UM-Flint faculty come together 

to 
create 
a 
cross-campus 

review of grievance reports and 
consensus across colleges on 
the best ways to handle faculty 
issues.

SACUA 
Chair 
William 

Schultz, 
professor 
of 

mechanical engineering at the 
University’s Ann Arbor campus, 
ended the meeting by saying 
the committee would review 
the concerns of the UM-Flint 
faculty and reach a decision in 
the coming weeks.

‘Virginia Woolf’ 
a timeless classic

Youthful film based 
on play rang in the 
“New Hollywood” 

movement

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

In “From the Vault,”Daily Arts 

takes a new look at old films.

“Who’s Afraid of Virginia 

Woolf?” was inevitable.

The play on which the film 

is based, written by the young 
playwright Edward Albee, a 
frequent observer of modern 
life, had won the Tony for Best 
Play three years before. Its two 
leading actors, Elizabeth Taylor 
and Richard Burton (both in 
“Cleopatra,” which was, at that 
date, the most expensive film 
ever), were frequently at the 
center of a media circus that 
followed their storied romance. 
And the film’s director, Mike 
Nichols, had just won two Tonys 
for directing back-to-back, and 
won a Grammy a few years before 
for his riotously funny comedy 
album with partner Elaine May.

1966, the film’s year of release, 

also proved to be a bountiful year 
for modern art, an exercise in 
questioning and re-evaluating 
the subjects and styles of our 
artistic creations. It was the year 
of “Revolver” and “Pet Sounds.” 
Pop art masters Roy Lichtenstein 
and Andy Warhol were at the top 
of their game and the Whitney 
Museum, a modernist mecca, 
opened in New York City. The 
building was designed by Marcel 
Breuer, a luminary figure in 
modern architecture who had 
developed an expertise in strange 
forms 
and 
materials 
before 

many of his contemporaries had 
even begun to dabble. Truman 
Capote released “In Cold Blood,” 
perhaps the Southern Gothic 
literature legend’s most famous 
work, which practically created 
the True Crime genre.

The cups of the collective arts 

were overflowing, except for 
film. By contrast, studios were 
desperately clutching onto the 
big movie model, continuing to 
rely on the old model of epic-
scale musicals and war films. 
But as the baby boom generation 
came of age in the mid-1960s 
and their taste began to dictate 
the future of art, film further 
declined. Studio heads began 
taking risks on unproven young 
directors: Scorsese and Allen, 
Spielberg and Friedkin.

The first of these directors 

was Mike Nichols, who in the 
summer of 1966 released his 
debut film, “Who’s Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?” After a party 
of academics and their partners 
in a quiet college town, one such 
couple, 
Martha 
and 
George 

(Taylor and Burton), invites a 
younger couple, Nick (George 
Segal, “A Touch of Class”) and 
Honey (Sandy Dennis, “The Out-
of-Towners”), to their house in 
the wee hours of the morning. 
Unbeknownst 
to 
the 
young 

couple, George and Martha’s 
marriage brings volatility to 
the extreme, with each hurtling 
abuse towards the other in an 
epic power struggle that erupts 
in front of their guests. George 
is plagued with feelings of 
insecurity, which Martha uses 
like a twisting knife in his back. 
George fights back, sometimes 
with success, sometimes with 
utter embarrassment. Rinse and 
repeat.

Taylor and Burton achieve the 

impossible by simultaneously 
slipping into their respective 
roles with an ease unmatched 
in 
film 
history 
while 
still 

maintaining 
their 
reputation 

as two of the greatest actors of 
their generation, if not all time. 
It takes talent to switch from 
grand-scale epics, in which the 
camera’s bravura can replace any 
acting deficiencies with elegant 
screen presence, to an intimate 
(and hardly flattering) character 
study. Yet Taylor and Burton 

don’t just succeed — they rewrite 
the rules of acting.

The 
dialogue 
of 
“Woolf,” 

undoubtedly the film’s defining 
feature, 
crackles 
with 
the 

same vivacity and anger at the 
larger 
sociopolitical 
system 

that afflicted much of the youth 
in 1966, even though the film 
centers on two adults. George 
and Martha’s verbal crusades 
against one another corrupt Nick 
and Honey into questioning their 
own marital vows.

That focus on the immature 

“grown-ups” in the room, and 
their 
pernicious 
influence 

on the people around them, 
is 
precisely 
what 
defines 

“Woolf” as the advent of New 
Hollywood. Young directors 
were dissecting cultural norms 
— including the idea that 
married people always love 
each other — which provided 
the foundation for the world in 
which they grew up. I presume 
nothing about the marital ties 
between the parents of Mike 
Nichols or Edward Albee, but 
“Woolf,” despite the extremity 
to which its characters take 
their troubles, is more truth 
than exaggeration.

“Who’s Afraid of Virginia 

Woolf?” is as much a product of 
its time — the film brims with 
youthful doubt over its married 
protagonists — as it is timeless. 
Despite the film’s black and 
white 
cinematography 
and 

character close-ups that scream 
“Old Hollywood,” it could be 
released today and still be just 
as affecting.

FROM THE VAULT

DuVernay’s ‘Sugar’ a 
cinematic TV debut

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

For the Daily

“Queen Sugar” understands 

that there’s just something 
about Louisiana. It might be the 
lush 
bayou 

landscape, or 
the 
brightly 

colored build-
ings populat-
ing the French 
Quarter, 
or 

even the vast 
expanse 
of 

green 
farm-

land, but not 
since “Treme” 
or 
“True 

Detective’s” 
first 
season 

has a series 
utilized the unique topography 
of this state so gorgeously. This 
isn’t to say, as they often do, 
that “Louisiana is its own char-
acter” in “Queen Sugar,” but 
rather that it provides a visual 
foundation for a show that is 
decidedly, remarkably visual.

Based on Natalie Baszile’s 

novel of the same name and 
premiering two episodes over 
the course of two days, “Queen 
Sugar” is of the classic “Six 
Feet Under” plot variety: the 
three Bordelon siblings must 
return to manage their child-
hood home, a plantation in 
Louisiana, after their father 
passes away. The series arrives 
with clear prestige ambitions 
and star power: it was created 
and developed by the famously 
Oscar-nomination-snubbed 
Ava DuVernay (“Selma”) and 
produced by Oprah Winfrey. It 
airs on Oprah’s eponymous net-
work. Laudably, the adaptation 
will also feature an all-female 
directorial team for its 13-epi-
sode first season. But, above 
all else, DuVernay proves to be 
“Queen Sugar” ’s real star.

DuVernay, who wrote and 

directed the pilot, possesses 

an incredible eye for shot com-
position; she understands how 
breathtaking the natural back-
ground and light of her setting 
is, and doesn’t force the issue 
when she doesn’t have to (look-
ing at you, “Mr. Robot”). It’s 
also simply a clinic in shoot-
ing, framing and lighting Black 
actors: the first shot of the 
series opens on Nova’s (Rutina 
Wesley, “True Blood”) dread-
locked hair, then takes its time 
photographing her body as she 
wakes up in the just-barely-
there light of New Orleans at 
dawn. It’s a gorgeous and pow-
erful opening statement for a 
series that operates primarily in 
the spaces between lines of dia-
logue, in those moments when 
both nothing and everything is 
said all at once.

There 
are, 
unfortunately, 

some missteps here and there. 
The writing does not often live 
up to the direction, with some 
generously 
served 
melodra-

matic clichés; a clumsily staged 
scene at a basketball game in 
the pilot doesn’t hit quite as 
hard as it should have, and 
there are an unfortunate num-
ber of distracting musical cues. 
For a show seemingly invested 
in silence and visual storytell-
ing, the errant, “Friday Night 
Lights”-esque twang of a guitar 
or a poorly judged soundtrack 
choice undermines the poten-
tial raw power of a scene’s 
intent.

The show’s three principals, 

however, are considerably top-
notch. Wesley shows off her 
formidable chops as Nova, the 
ostensibly strong sibling with a 
few secrets that might just ruin 
her projected emotional for-
titude. Dawn-Lyen Gardner’s 
(“Heroes”) Charley is the fam-
ily’s black sheep, the wealthy, 
successful wife of a Los Ange-
les basketball star who also 
hasn’t visited her family in 
years. Charley’s plot details 

are the most melodramatic, 
but her story contains snippets 
of interesting and potentially 
fascinating ideas: specifically, 
at the story’s beginning, her 
conversation with some other 
players’ wives about whether 
they should star in a “Real 
Housewives”-type 
reality 

series or not portends some the-
matic promise. Kofi Siriboe 
(“Awkward”) stars as Ralph 
Angel, a name that couldn’t be 
better. His understated perfor-
mance of a character that, in 
another creator’s hands, would 
have been destined to become a 
trope, is quietly heartbreaking. 
DuVernay, as mentioned before, 
finds interesting and excit-
ing ways of shooting her three 
leads, an impressive techni-
cal achievement that should be 
noticed. And, of course, there’s 
an adorable toddler, which is a 
net positive for any show.

“Queen Sugar” will most 

often be compared to other 
family dramas like “Parent-
hood” or “Friday Night Lights,” 
but its unique vision and scope 
will hopefully coax it out from 
under their towering shadows. 
“FNL,” too, used its camera in 
interesting, if sometimes jar-
ring, ways, but “Queen Sugar” ’s 
cinematography is currently the 
most impressive thing about it. 
Underwhelming writing aside, 
its merits are too abundant 
to ignore completely. “Queen 
Sugar” shows great potential to 
mature into something refresh-
ing, something cinematic — 
something great.

1966 was a 
year of new, 
revolutionary 
modern art.

Once chewed out on 
HBO, signal caller 
has built rapport 
with Harbaugh

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

Who 
knows 
how 
many 

people saw it? Those with an 
HBO subscription, at least.

In a 2015 episode of HBO’s 

“Real 
Sports 
with 
Bryant 

Gumbel,” 
then-newly 
hired 

Michigan 
football 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh hollered at a 
quarterback, 
whose 
number 

was blurred out, “I’m just telling 
you the right way to do it. If you 
wanna look at me, like, with that 
look, go f---ing somewhere else.”

The 
quarterback 
towered 

over 
Harbaugh, 
making 
it 

logical to conclude it was 6-foot-
6 Wilton Speight. Monday, 
Speight confirmed he was the 
blurred quarterback in the 
video, and assured reporters 
he and his coach are on much 
firmer ground now.

“Obviously it’s come a long 

way since that HBO special, 
telling me to, I think it was 
transfer somewhere else or 
go somewhere else,” Speight 
said. “All my buddies joked, 
they said, ‘Yeah, they blurred 
out the number, but you’re 
the only 8-foot quarterback in 
the country.’ So it was easily 
identifiable as me.”

And according to Speight, he 

wasn’t the only one getting that 
treatment.

“He was kind of taking shots 

at everybody, just trying to get 
all the softer guys out, because 
he was new and he needed to 
come in and make a statement,” 
Speight said.

“Obviously 
I 
didn’t 
like 

hearing it or having it on HBO 
for the whole country to see.”

Now, of course, Speight hasn’t 

given Harbaugh much reason to 
curse. After starting the 2016 
season with an interception 
against Hawaii, the redshirt 
sophomore has completed 35 
of his last 49 passes, throwing 
seven touchdowns with no 
more interceptions.

He was named the Big Ten 

Offensive Player of the Week on 
Monday, after a 312-yard, four-
touchdown 
showing 
against 

Central Florida, and he hasn’t 
showed signs of slowing down.

It’s a far cry from where he was 

at the time of the HBO special.

“That 
whole 
spring 
was 

rough,” Speight said. “I had 
torn my groin. Wasn’t really 
able to perform like I wanted 
to. But still practiced every 
practice, and came out really 

low on the depth chart. There 
was some hard self-evaluation 
after that spring with talking 
to Coach Fisch as well, and 
Coach Harbaugh, and they just 
said, ‘Hey, if you want this, 
you’ve just gotta work a little bit 
harder.’ And that’s what I did.”

At the time, Speight said he 

probably needed to be coached 
hard like that. Coming off a 
redshirt season in which he 
didn’t need to know the game 
plan, Speight admits his maturity 
and preparation weren’t where 
they needed to be.

To 
some 
degree, 
he 

acknowledged, he was checked 
out.

“(Harbaugh’s) 
just 
trying 

to wake you up and get your 
attention, and sometimes the 

best way to do that is verbally 
and very loud,” Speight said. “It 
worked for me. Obviously it’s 
worked for a lot of players on 
the team.”

That version of Harbaugh is 

in stark contrast with the one 
who Speight said laughed and 
told him to brush off that early-
season interception. By now, 
it seems, Harbaugh has cooled 
from the hard coaching.

Speight said Monday that 

Harbaugh knows better than 
to chew out his quarterback 
mid-game. And the redshirt 
sophomore 
shares 
that 

approach in the huddle.

“I kind of like to read each 

situation separately,” Speight 
said. “If I need to be vocal, I 
will, but I truthfully like to 

just be kind of calm. I think 
there was a couple times where 
I would be laughing during a 
play call or something this past 
Saturday, and that’s just kind of 
how I like to live every day. Not 
lackadaisical, but just chill, and 
go with the flow.

“There was one UCF player 

who was trying to talk smack 
at me, and I just started dying 
laughing, because we heard 
him from the huddle. And there 
were other times that we’d be 
up on the line of scrimmage and 
I’d think something was funny.”

If it seems strange Speight 

laughs off trash talk, remember 
that all of HBO has seen him 
chewed out by his own coach on 
national TV. Clearly, he came 
out of that just fine.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight has become the leader of Michigan’s offense, earning Jim Harbaugh’s trust since the two got off to a rocky start.

Speight secure at quarterback

Harbaugh: Don’t listen to Freddy P. Soft

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

has brought a lot of friendly faces 
with him from his past coaching 
stops, 
including 
offensive 

coordinator Tim Drevno and 
former 
defensive 
coordinator 

D.J. Durkin.

He also apparently brought 

along one not-so-friendly face: a 
4-inch tall man named Freddy 
P. Soft. Allegedly, while wearing 
“a cape and a hat with a plume 
in it,” Freddy stands on players’ 
shoulders and speaks directly 
into their ears, advising them to 
relax, take reps off and not put in 
full effort.

According 
to 
redshirt 

sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight, the coaches are well aware 
when Freddy makes appearances 
in practice — especially during fall 
camp, when Drevno will literally 
yell at his own shoulder to tell 
Freddy to go away.

This imaginary and unusual 

figure may sound like nothing 
more 
than 
a 
humorous 

motivational tool, but he might 
be the Wolverines’ worst enemy 
after two games this season. 
Fresh off wins over Hawaii and 
Central Florida by a combined 
score of 114-17, Michigan sits at 
No. 4 in the rankings and has 
barely been tested.

But even with the dominance 

on the scoreboard, Harbaugh 
refuses to allow his team to be 
complacent, and he’s happy to 
see that the Wolverines still have 
plenty of room to improve.

“I’m very excited, as a coach, 

that when you win a game 51-14 
and then you still have things to go 
in and coach and feel like you can 
improve your play on,” Harbaugh 
said. “Probably no better feeling as 
a coach than to start the week that 
way. It makes me very optimistic 

that there’s ways that we can 
improve, there’s things that we 
can fix. I’m very confident with 
the coaches and players that we 
have that we’ll do that.”

Michigan was never in any 

real trouble in the win over the 
Knights on Saturday, but a few 
cracks in the armor did emerge.

Thanks to a few quarterback 

scrambles 
and 
an 
87-yard 

touchdown run, UCF finished 
the game with an eye-popping 
275 rushing yards against the 
Wolverines, 
a 
number 
that 

certainly won’t cut it against 
more 
talented 
opponents. 

Michigan’s defensive line feels 
the problem is fixable, though, 
especially given that it was just 

a few big plays that inflated the 
Knights’ numbers.

“I think it’s just (a matter of) 

all of us working together on the 
D-line,” said fifth-year senior 
defensive lineman Matt Godin. 
“A lot of times, our rush lanes get 
a little hectic. Different guys doing 
different moves, one guy goes 
inside, one guy goes outside. I think 
if we just get the communication 
better in the coming weeks, we’ll 
definitely improve.”

Redshirt 
sophomore 

defensive end Chase Winovich, 
a player who appears to play 
every down at a hundred miles 
an hour, agreed with that 
sentiment. 
When 
defensive 

players are making full-speed 

decisions, he said, sometimes 
all a ball carrier needs is a few 
feet of space to get loose.

The Wolverines experienced 

similar communication issues on 
the other side of the ball, where 
some well-timed UCF blitzes 
and a stacked run defense held 
Michigan running backs to just 
2.9 yards per carry.

Harbaugh 
said 
Michigan’s 

offensive linemen occasionally 
struggled to communicate, slide 
their feet and have their eyes in 
the right place, but all are fixable 
issues that will be points of 
emphasis going forward.

Even 
as 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled 
with 
the 
running 

game, though, Harbaugh noted 

that they were able to take 
advantage of opportunities in 
the play-action passing game, 
with Speight finding receivers in 
single coverage and throwing for 
312 yards.

Michigan’s few flaws haven’t 

come back to hurt it so far, 
and there’s plenty of time to 
figure them out — as long as the 
Wolverines continue to put in 
the work and shake off Freddy P. 
Soft, that is.

“We’re gonna embrace the 

adversity that comes with this 
game, and we’re gonna address 
it,” Winovich said. “And if it 
comes in the form of Freddy P. 
Soft, we’re gonna try our best to 
spell him.”

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh tries to prevent his team from getting complacent by using the personification “Freddy P. Soft” as motivation.


Ryan’s adjustment 
powers Wolverines 
to four second-half 

goals at home

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

At first, it seemed to be 

inconsequential.

It was about the 55th minute 

in a scoreless affair when UC 
Riverside committed a foul in 
its attacking third, giving a free 
kick to the Michigan women’s 
soccer team. So far from the 
goal, nothing usually comes 
from these types of plays. Teams 
typically send the ball forward 
and hope someone finds a way to 

maintain possession.

The Wolverines did just that, 

kicking the ball up the field 
toward a sea of jerseys. But 
something else happened prior 
to that free kick, something that 
might have been easily missed 
upon first glance.

“Everybody up, in our half!”
The 
voice 
belonged 
to 

Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
Standing at the edge of his 
technical area, Ryan began 
yelling 
at 
his 
players 
to 

remind them of their halftime 
discussion.

The Wolverines followed his 

direction almost immediately, 
positioning themselves further 
up the field and embracing an 
uptempo style of play. The shift 
worked wonders for Michigan, 
which scored four goals in 

the second half to earn a 4-0 
victory.

The first half hadn’t gone 

the Wolverines’ way, as they 
struggled to hold onto the 
ball at the back and create 
meaningful scoring chances at 
the front. After the game, Ryan 
admitted the Highlanders came 
out with a system Michigan 
hadn’t expected to see, and 
consequently 
struggled 
to 

handle.

“They played a 4-4-2, and so 

they outnumbered us in midfield 
in the first half because we only 
had three in there, and they had 
four,” Ryan said. “So by playing 
five at the back (in the second 
half), we were able to deal with 
their two forwards.

“We had three against the 

two, two against two (on the 
outside), two against two in 
the middle and three against 
four (at the top), so it’s a lot 
of pressure for them to deal 
with.”

Ten minutes into the second 

half, 
the 
Wolverines 
still 

hadn’t fully implemented their 
revised game plan, so when the 
stoppage of play gave Ryan an 
opportunity to make in-game 
adjustments, the normally soft-
spoken coach made sure his 
voice was heard. 

“When we heard (Ryan) start 

yelling at us, we’re just like, 
‘Next five, next five,’ and took 
it five minutes at a time and 
went hard,” said sophomore 
midfielder Abby Kastroll.

Pushing 

numbers 
forward 
into 

the 
attack 

and 
pressing 

higher 
up 

the 
pitch, 

Michigan 
dramatically 
shifted 
the 

run of play in 
its favor. Like 
a light switch, Ryan’s call for 
renewed emphasis on offense 
electrified the Wolverines, who 

responded with a level of energy 
and intensity that UC Riverside 

couldn’t 
restrain.

Just 
three 

minutes later, 
Michigan 
found the back 
of 
the 
net. 

Sprinting into 
space out wide 
on the right 
side 
of 
the 

field, Kastroll 

beat her defender to the ball 
and sent a low cross across the 
mouth of the goal that sat well 

for sophomore forward Reilly 
Martin, who made a smart 
run toward the far post. After 
sliding the ball through the 
legs of Highlander goalkeeper 
Alanna Guzman, Martin gave 
the Wolverines their game-
winner.

And after tasting a goal, 

Michigan wanted more. The 
Wolverines kept their feet on 
the gas and kept the pressure 
on UC Riverside, which didn’t 
have an answer for Michigan’s 
revitalized offense.

The Wolverines added three 

more goals to their tally in the 

final 10 minutes to put the game 
completely out of reach.

Reflecting on his message to 

the team in that pivotal moment 
in the 55th minute, Ryan put it 
candidly.

“‘Look, we’re changing the 

way we’re playing,’” he said 
of that moment. “That was 
probably a good moment for 
us, recognizing, ‘Let’s just get 
forward. Let’s get after these 
guys.’”

Five words out of Ryan’s 

mouth was all it took for 
Michigan to completely change 
the outcome of the game.
