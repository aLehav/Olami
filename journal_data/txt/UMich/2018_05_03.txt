MSU professor accused 
of sexual harassment

William Jacoby 
under investigation 
by U-M and MSU 

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

Valerie 
Sulfaro, 
currently 
a 
professor of political science at 
James Madison University, was 
considering switching out of her 
international 
relations 
subfield 
when she was 23 years old and in 
her second year of graduate school 
at the University of South Carolina 
in 1989. This was when she met 
William Jacoby, then a faculty 
member at USC, who convinced her 
to study public opinion and voting 
behavior, his subfield.
Jacoby 
is 
now 
a 
political 
science professor at Michigan 
State University and a director of 
the Inter-University Consortium 
for Political and Social Research 
Summer Program at the University 
of Michigan. Both MSU and the 
University are investigating him for 

sexual misconduct. 
According 
to 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzgerald, 
Jacoby will not be teaching this 
summer with ICPSR, though Jacoby 
can still be found on MCommunity.
According to Sulfaro, she served 
as a teaching assistant for a course 
Jacoby taught in the fall semester of 
1990. In the winter of 1990, he came 
to her office and closed the door. 
“I remember very clearly what 
he said,” Sulfaro said. “He said he 
was laying his cards on the table, 
and then proposed an intimate 
relationship with me. I was stunned. 
I did not say yes. I did not say no. I 
said maybe, because I could not 
figure out what to say.”
Sulfaro also said Jacoby told her 
she was sending clear signals of 
her interest in him. According to 
Sulfaro, his misinterpretation of her 
feelings crushed her confidence.
She then said Jacoby kissed her 
with his arm around her and ground 
his pelvis into her.
“It was not an innocent kiss,” 
Sulfaro said. “He had not waited for 
me to say yes or to think about what 

I wanted. And at that moment I felt 
like I had cheated on my boyfriend 
without ever intending to.”
This was not the only time Sulfaro 
had such an encounter with Jacoby. 
In an email to The Daily, Sulfaro 
wrote Jacoby sexually harassed her 
while she was presenting a paper 
at the Midwest Political Science 
Association in 1996 and kissed her 
again without consent. At the MPSA 
conference, Jacoby allegedly offered 
Sulfaro a computer disc with nude 
photos of himself on it.
The 
University’s 
sexual 
harassment policy labels unwanted 
sexual 
statements, 
personal 
attention and physical and sexual 
advances as sexual harassment. The 
policy also states the University will 
be unsympathetic to any consensual 
relationships when there is a clear 
power differential between the 
parties. Sulfaro said she considered 
the relationship consensual because 
Jacoby did not rape her and she 
did not run away, even though the 
relationship was not her choice.

Speaker 
shares hope 
at spring
convocation

Charles Woodson 
speaks on unity and 
hope for graduates

By ALEXAST. JOHN & RIYAH BASHA 

Editor in Chief & Managing News Editor

“When you look around, I don’t 
want you to see Black, White, Asian. I 
don’t want you to wonder if a person is 
Democrat or Republican, gay or straight. 
When you look around I just want you to 
simply see human beings. Nothing more, 
nothing less.”
This is the sentiment University of 
Michigan alum Charles Woodson left 
class of 2018 graduates with Saturday 
morning at spring commencement. 
Other speakers emphasized themes 
of service, community and Michigan 
fandom.
University Provost Martin Philbert, 
professor of toxicology in the School 
of Public Health, was the first to make 
remarks at Saturday’s ceremony. 
Speaking on the class of 2018, 
Philbert said, “They have challenged 
us, their teachers, to examine our own 
ideas. In the face of new evidence and 
different perspectives, we thank them 
for reminding us learning is a lifelong 
endeavor.”
LSA now-graduate Jad Elharake 
then spoke about his experiences and 
challenges as an Arab-Muslim student 
and a first generation college student, 
leading him to this moment to “come for 
everything they said we couldn’t have.”
“We 
faced 
challenges, 
made 
sacrifices but experienced joy along the 
way,” Elharake said. “It is critical we 
remember those who empowered us.”
Elharake 
introduced 
LSA 
Dean 
Andrew Martin, who spoke on the 
significance of academic freedom.

Interactive mural 
 
piques AA interest

Downtown winged 
artwork bolsters 
U-M social media 
presence

By ELIZABETH LAWRENCE

Daily Staff Reporter

When 2018 graduate Sejal Mehta 
walked by the newly commissioned 
mural, a pair of maize and blue wings 
painted by artist Kelsey Montague, 
at the corner of East William and 
Maynard streets at Tower Plaza, 
she saw a fabulous Instagram 
opportunity. She posed underneath 
the wings, threw her graduation cap 
in the air and had her friend of four 
years snap the photo.
“It just turned out really well,” 
Mehta said. “I was wearing a 
yellow dress that went well with 
the colors and then I just posted the 
photo to celebrate being done with 
everything.”
The 
mural’s 
clear 
invitation 
for photo ops is exactly what the 
commissioners intended. The idea 

for the mural originated in the 
University of Michigan Department 
of Communication as part of a 
yearly initiative to show University 
constituents the impact social media 
has. Nicole Sunstrum, director of 
social media, said her department 
wanted to foster an appreciation of 
art and bolster the University’s social 
media presence.
“The ultimate goal was to provide 
an opportunity for individuals to 
appreciate art, first and foremost, 
and to also take a photograph to 
share and tag U of M, and feel proud 
of their University,” Sunstrum said.
To bring this project to life, 
U-M Social Media worked with 
the University Arts and Culture 
Initiative, LSA, Destination Ann 
Arbor and the Ann Arbor Downtown 
Development Authority. Sunstrum 
said 
she 
encountered 
one 
of 
Montague’s wing murals in Nashville, 
Tenn., and after witnessing the long 
line of people waiting to take photos, 
thought it would be the perfect fit 
for the project. Montague’s series of 

By Fall semester 
internet access will 
be available on Diag

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

 
The University of Michigan’s 
Information 
and 
Technology 
Services 
announced 
plans 
last 
Thursday to install Wi-Fi on the 
Diag, providing wireless internet 
access to the Central Campus area 
surrounding the block ‘M.’
The initiative began in Fall 2017 
when LSA senior Anushka Sarkar, 
former Central Student Government 
president, and CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior, started their respective 
appointments after campaigning 
on the promise of Wi-Fi on the 
Diag. The pair took action soon 
after coming into office, contacting 
the U-M administration to discuss 
outdoor internet access. University 
President Mark Schlissel supported 
the idea and ITS received funds to 
add the initiative to its list of projects.
Sarkar noted she worked closely 
with 
University 
administrators, 
especially Schlissel, to push the plan 
forward.
“I campaigned on this when I ran 
for CSG President because it’s an 
unexpectedly important component 
of daily student life, but its success 
is also a demonstration of two 
important tenets of effective student 

advocacy: the power of persistence, 
and the power of the personal 
relationship,” Sarkar wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily. “I 
stayed in pretty close contact with 
the key decision-makers for this 
issue throughout the year (mainly in 
Student Life, IT, and the President’s 
office) to ensure it would be 
prioritized during the university’s 
budget process.”
Major internet access renovations 
have been underway since 2016 
when ITS began the Campuswide 
WiFi Upgrade Project with the 
goal of improving wireless access 
in 275 locations across campus. 
Andy Palms, executive director of 
ITS Infrastructure, said that before 
Sarkar took initiative, ITS would 
occasionally set up temporary Wi-Fi 
for outdoor events near the Diag 
and had discussed the feasibility 
of installing it permanently. But, 
according to Palms, ITS did not have 
official plans to bring Wi-Fi to the 
Diag.
“We’d been expecting that our 
students and faculty and staff would 
be fine just with using their cell 
phones when they are outdoors,” 
Palms said. “In fact, our whole 
project that we’ve had for the last 
three years to enhance Wi-Fi inside 
all the buildings, we intentionally 
had not included outdoor spaces.”

Sulfaro 
has 
since 
filed 
complaints with the University, 
MSU, MPSA and two other 
professional 
organizations. 
After filing the complaint with 
the 
University, 
Sulfaro 
said 
Elizabeth Seney, U-M deputy 
Title IX coordinator, contacted 
her but never followed up with 
her or her witnesses. University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald stated 
the University does not confirm 
nor deny the existence of the 
investigation against Jacoby by 
the Office of Institutional Equity.
Rebecca 
Gill, 
an 
associate 
professor of political science at 
the University of Nevada, Las 
Vegas, was also propositioned 
by Jacoby for a relationship. 
Following 
a 
presentation 
of 

her paper at a 2001 conference, 
Jacoby approached Gill and gave 
positive remarks on her work. 
Jacoby encouraged her to take 
an ICPSR course he taught in the 
summer of 2002 at Michigan, and 
she did.
After the last day of Jacoby’s 
course, Gill, Jacoby and others 
went to a pub to celebrate the end 
of the session. Jacoby told Gill 
about “how mysterious and good-
looking she was” and that they 
would both be working together 
at MSU.
Jacoby then asked Gill to 
consider having an affair with 
him, implying the relationship 
would be a way to advance her 
career at MSU.
Gill spoke to Jacoby once after 
this incident, soon before her 
graduation from MSU. According 
to Gill, at the time Jacoby’s wife 
was the graduate director of 

Gill’s 
doctoral 
program. 
The 
program’s policy required that 
Ph.D. students with specializing 
in American politics had to 
have Jacoby on their doctoral 
committee. Gill requested not to 
have Jacoby on her committee 
because of her discomfort with 
him, and when meeting with 
Jacoby, was told she was mistaken 
about the pub incident.
“I expected him to say, ‘Oh I 
never meant to make you feel that 
way,’” Gill said. “But, he just said, 
‘That didn’t happen. You must be 
mistaken.’”
Gill 
told 
The 
Daily 
she 
graduated late from the program, 
finishing after Jacoby’s wife’s 
role as the Graduate Director 
ended in 2007.

City Council votes to repurchase 
property on South Fifth Avenue

At a special session 
councilmembers 
supported affordable 
housing for downtown

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

During their fourth and final decision 
on the “Y lot” repurchase, Ann Arbor 
City Council voted 11-0 to purchase the 
lot for $4.2 million at 350 South Fifth 
Avenue.
The special session on Tuesday 
comes after postponing the decision in 
previous meetings. The city had sold the 
lot to local real estate developer Dennis 
Dahlmann in 2014 for $5.25 million with 
a promise to create affordable housing 
and commercial developments on the lot. 
The lot is still vacant, and Dahlmann has 
sued the city in order to extend his own-
ership of the lot for another four years.
Many residents called for the afford-
able housing prices to be based on medi-
an income instead of a fair-market value. 
The fair-market rent is determined by 
the market value of a unit, but many 
residents voiced their preference for 
rent to be based off Ann Arbor’s median 
income to make the units more afford-
able. According to the 2016 census, Ann 
Arbor’s median income is $57
,697 and 
the city’s poverty rate is at 23.4 percent.
In the city’s decision, rent will be 
based on a fair-market rent of 110 percent 

of fair market range. The city has not yet 
determined the number of units to be 
built on the property.
Ann Arbor resident Sharon Ongaro 
called upon City Council to repurchase 
the lot to help those who work in the 
downtown area have affordable housing.
“There’s opportunity for the city of 
Ann Arbor to step in, take control of that 
lot and hand it to a developer with the 
requirement that some number of the 
units be affordable housing,” Ongaro 
said. “We all know that it’s needed. We all 
know that gentrification has taken place 
and shoved people out of their homes 
through the years and we need to have 
affordable housing so the people that are 
making our downtown tick have a place 
to stay.”
Ann Arbor resident Sandi Smith, a 
local realtor and president of the Washt-
enaw Housing Alliance, was also in favor 
of City Council repurchasing the lot as 
a way to address housing affordability 
issues in the city.
“Y
ou (City Council) need to take 
some action,” Smith said. “This won’t 
solve everything, but you need to take 
some action to make sure that you get 
some money into the affordable housing 
trust fund. A good way to find affordable 
units is to use government-owned land. 
It’s smart.”
Councilmember Zachary Ackerman, 
D-Ward 3, sponsored the resolution as a 
means of improving Ann Arbor’s afford-
ability and quality of life for citizens.
“I think as we build a community 
with a high quality of life and a sustain-

able economy, we need to look to that 
same premise that intentionally pro-
moting affordability is critical to sustain 
quality of life and a healthy economy,” 
Ackerman said.
Councilmember Sumi Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 1, also supported the resolution, 
expressing a desire to see the city stick to 
its project plans and not turn the prop-
erty into a luxury facility.
“We have seen way too many proj-
ects that are being built that are being 
called affordable units but are really not 
affordable at all,” Kailasapathy said. “I 
don’t want to get into a situation of voting 
on this and then later on saying ‘it’s not 
financially (liable). We are going to put 
luxury units for affordable units which 
are $1600 for a two-bedroom apart-
ment.’ Affordable for who? That’s more 
than the mortgage I used to pay.”
Despite voting for the resolution, 
Councilmember Jane Lumm, I-Ward 
2, supported the city’s attempt to repur-
chase the property but did not support 
the specified resolution proposed at the 
meeting because of the project’s expens-
es.
“Building affordable housing units on 
the city’s most expensive real estate does 
not make economic or financial sense,” 
Lumm said. “It is also not the most cost-
effective way to leverage taxpayers’ dol-
lars in adding affordable housing units.”
Protesters from organizations such as 
Ann Arbor Ozone House were present at 
the meeting calling for the city to repur-
chase the lot and construct affordable 
housing units.

Freedom of speech — especially 
in the context of racism and hate 
speech — has been a linchpin for 
the campus community this year in 
light of controversy over a potential 
appearance by white supremacist 
Richard Spencer. 
“If we don’t trust our ideas enough to 
sail them out of harbor once in a while, 
they remain unformed, untested,” he 
said. “Rather than wrapping ourselves 
in a security blanket … we raised a 
collective voice against those who lack 
collective decency.”
Martin ended his remarks with 
the notion that, “in the long run, good 
ideas triumph over bad; integrity beats 
dishonesty.”
Public Policy now-graduate Nadine 
Jawad, outgoing Central Student 
Government vice president, discussed 
the importance of service, following 
the example of the Ford School of 
Public Policy’s eponym, Gerald Ford.
“When I think of the University of 
Michigan and the Ford School, I think 
of the will to overcome challenges 
and in that will I see a very distinct 
opportunity,” Jawad noted, discussing 
the challenges of the year and her 
college tenure but importance of 
looking toward change.“There is 
nothing more important than my 
service to those around me.”
University President Mark Schlissel 
mentioned his special connection with 
this year’s graduates, as he began his 
tenure at the University of Michigan 
in 2014 when the 2018 graduates 
were starting their University careers 
as freshmen. He noted many of the 
athletic triumphs at the University 
in the past four years, gaining cheers 
from the audience with references to 
teams’ runs in the Final and Frozen 
Four championships, among other 
noteworthy events. Schlissel discussed 
graduation as a turning point for a 
“new community of scholars.” 
“Class of 2018, today you graduate 
into an increasingly global society 
where the challenges are enormous 
and there are no simple answers,” 
Schlissel said.
Schlissel expressed the importance 
for graduates to live their lives 
embodying the “Michigan difference.”
“I believe we all change the world 
in ways large and small, and each of 
us through our Michigan experience 
finds a way to make an impact,” he 
said.
Following Schlissel and other 
speakers were presentations to four 
honorary degree recipients, including: 
Jeanne Craig Sinkford, who received 
an honorary doctor of science; Penny 
Stamps, who received an honorary 
doctor of fine arts; David Walt, who 

received an honorary doctor of science; 
and main speaker Woodson, who 
received an honorary doctor of laws.
Woodson, 
the 
1997 
Heisman 
Trophy winner who led the Wolverines 
to the 1997 co-national championship, 
then 
addressed 
the 
graduates. 
Woodson made lighthearted jokes 
noting, “You’re all stuck with me … but 
at least this year you have a speaker.”
This 
referred 
to 
student 
disappointment 
surrounding 
last 
year’s commencement, at which 
no specific speaker was named in 
exchange for a Bicentennial-themed 
ceremony.
Woodson began by drawing several 
parallels between him and Desmond 
Howard, another famed Michigan 
football player, Heisman Trophy 
awardee and national championship 
winner.
“Once you get here, you get to 
witness the tradition of Michigan,” 
Woodson said. “…When you leave here, 
that’s the time when you’re really going 
to appreciate your time being here.”
Woodson 
also 
made 
a 
few 
politically-charged allusions about a 
hypothetical wall between Michigan 
and Ohio — his home state — taking on 
commentary against President Donald 
Trump. 
“If we built that wall, neither me nor 
Desmond (Howard) could have come 
here...so scratch that.”
He later shifted to a message about 
service. Speaking about his childhood 
being raised by single mother of three, 
Woodson said he wasn’t alone, and 
he couldn’t have gotten where he is 
without others.
Then, Woodson touched on the 
recent anniversary of the death of Dr. 
Martin Luther King 50 years ago this 
month, and the significance of King’s 
activism and commitment to racial 
justice.
“Dr. King cared about people, and 
he gave his time, he gave his energy, 
and ultimately Dr. King gave his life,” 
Woodson said. “But those things that 
were happening to people, it never 
stopped him from trying to help 
others. He helped people he knew, he 
helped people that he didn’t know and 
that’s because of one major quality that 
I believe that he had that I hope all of 
you have as you go through your life. ”
He made a request to the graduating 
class: to look around and see people as 
they are.
“I guarantee you, if you can begin 
to see people that way, just as human 
beings, you will begin to treat them 
differently,” Woodson said. “You will 
begin to understand their points of 
views … I’m asking you — I’m begging 
you — do not carry the hate forward.”

W

ith 
many 
people 
expecting Democrats 
to take back the U.S. 
House of Representatives — and 
even the Senate — in 2018, it is an 
opportune time to go over the way 
Democrats can continue to win 
and make gains going forward. 
Let me preface this by saying that 
I am not a Democrat. However, I 
do think they are preferable to the 
Republicans, and changing the 
party from within is a realistic 
way to achieve positive change 
in this country.
The 
Democratic 
National 
Committee has made it clear 
there is little room in the 
party for socially conservative 
candidates. Yet, somehow, they 
seem to always find a place 
for 
corrupt, 
warmongering, 
corporate 
stooges. 
Take 
their failed 2016 presidential 
candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton. 
Despite voting for the War in 
Iraq and being the architect of 
the intervention that has turned 
Libya into a failed state, she was 
fully embraced by the DNC.
Or 
what 
about 
Chicago 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel? Despite 
campaigning on a platform of 
strengthening the public school 
system, he has since met privately 
with Education Secretary Betsy 
DeVos, and is currently leading 
the largest mass public school 
closing ever in one U.S. city. The 
DNC still fully supports him.
Where do we draw the line? 
If these characters have the 

DNC’s full endorsement, why 
is it considered beyond the pale 
to get behind a candidate who 
just so happens to be pro-life? 
Something is not right here.
If Democrats want to not 
only win but usher in positive 
populist 
change, 
they 
must 
rebrand themselves as a more 
fiscally liberal and more socially 
conservative party. Now, when 
I say socially conservative, I do 
not mean they should campaign 
on 
failed, 
unpopular 
and 
immoral policies such as being 
anti-gay marriage and pro-War 
on Drugs. However, accepting 
those who are pro-life, skeptical 
of marijuana legalization or talk 
about “family values” would not 
be such a bad thing.
Rather than putting too much 
emphasis on social issues and 
refusing 
to 
endorse 
pro-life 
candidates, wouldn’t it be better 
if the DNC ostracized those who 
took PAC money and did not 
support universal health care, 
free college and a living wage? At 
the end of the day, it’s all about the 
economy. While the Republicans 
push ever further right toward 
oligarchy, the Democrats could 
really separate themselves by 
morphing into a party pushing 
for a government that is created 
by and for the people.
Social 
conservatism 
mixed 
with 
economic 
leftism 
is 
a 
winning 
strategy. 
For 
example, it fills a previously 
unfilled niche. Take the four 

biggest political parties: the 
Republican Party, Democratic 
Party, Libertarian Party and 
Green 
Party. 
Republicans 
are both socially and fiscally 
conservative. 
Democrats 
are 
more socially liberal but frankly, 
generally fiscally conservative. 
Libertarians are socially liberal 
and fiscally conservative and 
the Greens are both socially and 
fiscally liberal.
If you didn’t notice, only one 
quadrant remains untouched. 
Finding this niche and running 
with it would help Democrats 
not just to do better in red states 
but nationwide as well. What so 
few people realize is the biggest 
crossover vote in America is 
those voters who are socially 
conservative and fiscally more 
leftist. This makes sense, as 
they often feel as though there 
is no party that really represents 
them, and they’re right.
In 
the 
2016 
presidential 
election, the vast majority of 
these people voted for someone 
other 
than 
the 
Democratic 
candidate. If the Democratic 
Party embraces this philosophy, 
they could not only break up 
Republican hegemony in the 
heartland 
but 
become 
the 
dominant 
political 
force 
for 
years to come. Sounds like a good 
idea to me.

A new way forward

Save student newsrooms
T

he 
press 
has 
always 
played a significant part 
in 
American 
society. 
Whether it was when our found-
ing fathers called for freedom 
of speech or President Trump’s 
condemnations of liberal news 
outlets as “fake news,” the 
importance of news outlets has 
never wavered. Similarly, col-
lege newspapers should have an 
equally secure role on campus-
es. However, recently, student 
newspapers are facing ever-
growing challenges that have 
forced them to either shut down 
or reaffiliate with their uni-
versity. Reaffiliation not only 
takes away valuable indepen-
dence from students, but it also 
reduces the integrity of the 
news and reporting that comes 
from the publication.
University 
campuses 
are 
microcosms of the real world, 
and what would the real world be 
like without the media? An unin-
formed mess. Or, at least, more 
of an uninformed mess. Student-
run publications provide a plat-
form for students to voice their 
concerns about the school as 
well as shed light on the issues 
that may or may not plague their 
campus.The paper provides an 
environment in which students 
can express their opinions and 
learn about their campus with-
out fear of being shut down or 
shunned by the university. How-
ever, as more and more campus 
papers lose funding, the voice of 
the students becomes weaker.
Additionally, a student paper 
that is funded by its university 
has a conflict of interest. How 
are student journalists supposed 
to criticize the organization that 
is funding them? Independence 
from their corresponding uni-
versity allows student papers to 
objectively look at the decisions 
of the university, much like inde-
pendence from the government 
allows media outlets such as The 
New York Times or The Wash-
ington Post to judge the actions 
of our government. We all know 
that the University of Michigan 
has had issues in the past with 
addressing their actions and 
decisions and had the Daily not 
been an independent student 
organization, 
these 
problems 
might have been ignored and stu-
dents would not be able to voice 
their anxieties about the Univer-
sity. Without student criticism 
and curiosity, how is a college 

campus supposed to improve?
The University of Michigan is 
not a campus free from scandal. 
In just the past year, we have had 
racist messages plague both cam-
pus landmarks and our residence 
halls while the University does 
little in the way of clear action 
towards change. The Michigan 
in Color section, MiC, provides 
a place where students can dis-
cuss campus climate and call 
out the University for surface-
level solutions and actions. The 
paper is a place where students 
can find support and informa-
tion about the more-suspicious 
behavior of their school.
The importance of indepen-
dent college newspapers isn’t in 
just content, though. Students 
create a tight-knit community 
when they hold the sole respon-
sibility of representing their 
organization; there is no paren-
tal figure in the university loom-
ing over their heads, threatening 
a “grounding” of sorts should 
things go wrong. The unique 
experience that comes from this 
autonomy should be something 
that students and alumni alike 
should work to give their peers 
and future generations.
College newspapers are also 
another way to help students 
feel comfortable on campus, and 
with more shutting down, there 
are fewer spaces where new peo-
ple can find their way. My first 
year on the Daily, I met interest-
ing people with diverse opinions 
and experiences in our Edit-
board. I learned how to move 
past the discomfort of having 
someone else read my writing. 
The Daily created a space where 
I could learn about the goings-on 
at our university in an accurate 
and objective way, without hav-
ing to sift through the nonsense 
of Twitter and Facebook groups. 
 
It should be no question 
that student newspapers are 
important parts of universities. 
They’re needed to not only main-
tain but also create conversation 
surrounding issues on campus. 
Saving student newsrooms is 
a pivotal movement that we 
should all care about and sup-
port. If you want to learn more 
and read about other universi-
ties, check out the movement at

N

ame five major pieces 
of 
legislation 
passed 
by 
the 
U.S 
Congress 
under the current administration. 
Having trouble? That’s because 
this Congress, even though the 
Republican Party controls both 
houses and the presidency, is the least 
effective since the Civil War.
While Washington, D.C. is para-
lyzed, Lansing is very much in 
motion. Yet despite the power that 
state government has to change our 
everyday lives, most of us ignore 
it. That needs to change because 
destructive policy gets passed when 
the public eye is averted.
I understand why the federal 
government gets more attention; 
it’s flashier. There are no shows like 
“West Wing” or “House of Cards” set 
in state capitols and no one dreams to 
be governor when they can aim for 
president. However, it may surprise 
people that the states, not the federal 
government, hold most of the govern-
ing power in this country.
The 10th Amendment states the 
federal government only has the 
powers explicitly granted to it in the 
U.S. Constitution, leaving the rest 
to the states. This is not meant to be 
a crash course on the Constitution, 
but our foundational document gives 
surprisingly few powers to the fed-
eral government. That means state 
governments hold the lion’s share 
of constitutionally derived power. 
Furthermore, because of federalism, 
states can challenge the federal gov-
ernment instead of being forced to 
stay in line.
Health? There is no mention of it 
in the Constitution. Education? That 
is a state issue as well. Now, of course, 
there are the federal Departments of 
Education and Health and Human 
Services but those are just creative 
applications of the federal govern-
ment’s 
constitutionally 
derived 
powers. Moreover, in both health 
and education, it is the states that do 
more anyway.
So what has Michigan’s govern-
ment done recently? Besides the Flint 
water crisis, I doubt most people 
could answer this with any certain-
ty. This is not to say that people are 
dumb, only that it is easy to forget the 
importance of state government and 
therefore not pay attention.
One recent example of states flex-
ing their muscles came when the 
attorneys general of seven states 
— Hawaii, Washington, Minne-
sota, Oregon, New York and Mas-
sachusetts — sued President Donald 
Trump’s administration over the ban 

imposed on Muslim-majority nations. 
Instead of joining his colleagues in 
opposing an unconstitutional and 
xenophobic policy, Michigan Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette was busy 
preparing to run for governor. Once 
he did declare his candidacy, Trump 
promptly endorsed him on Twitter.
Speaking of Flint, Gov. Rick Snyder 
announced in early April that a free 
bottled water and water filter distri-
bution program funded by state and 
federal dollars would come to an end 
once current supplies run out. This 
decision comes as Flint residents still 
do not trust the safety of the water. 
“This is wrong,” tweeted Mona Han-
na-Attisha, the pediatrician whose 
study of blood lead levels in Flint’s 
children helped blow the lid off the 
water crisis and state cover-up. She is 
right; if the state government believes 
the water is safe then they need to 
convince the people of Flint instead 
of spontaneously cutting off the free 
bottled water.
The state Congress, also Republi-
can-controlled, has its own share of 
troubling policy. In November 2017, 
the state Senate passed Senate Bills 
584-586 that would allow people 
with enhanced licenses to carry 
concealed pistols into churches, 
schools, bars and other “no gun” 
zones. I believe guns should be 
allowed in fewer places, not more. 
The thought of someone, with an 
enhanced license or not, carrying 
a pistol into my younger brother’s 
high school is disturbing. Luckily, 
the bills are currently stalled in the 
state House of Representatives’ 
Judiciary Committee.
Last year, House Bill 4221 and Sen-
ate Bill 162 were introduced in the 
state Legislature. Both bills would 
have completely defunded Planned 
Parenthood and other women’s 
health providers that perform abor-
tions by prohibiting the state to 
contract the providers. Currently, 
Planned Parenthood and others 
have funding contracts for a variety 
of health services excluding abor-
tion. Another bill would have forced 
abortion clinics to get licenses with 
burdensome requirements, mirror-
ing a piece of Texas legislation that 
was struck down by the U.S. Supreme 
Court. All of these anti-choice bills 
have not advanced to a vote.
If you have made it to this point in 
the column, you might think all bills 
in the state Legislature are poorly 
conceived. 
However, 
Michigan’s 
state government has done some 
good. For instance, Snyder and the 
state Legislature worked together to 

expand Medicaid under the Afford-
able Care Act in 2013.
Good bills are also sitting in the 
House and Senate right now, waiting 
to be passed. Democratic state Reps. 
Adam Zemke of Ann Arbor and Dar-
rin Camilleri of Brownstown Town-
ship have introduced House Bills 
5550 in the House’s Health Policy 
Committee to ban licensed mental 
health professionals from offering 
gay conversion therapy to minors. 
Fourteen of the most reputable 
health advocacy organizations in 
the country, including the American 
Psychological Association, American 
Psychiatric Association and Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics, oppose 
conversion therapy as both baseless 
and damaging to mental health.
Additionally, 37 bills have been 
introduced in the state Legislature to 
combat sexual assault in the wake of 
the Larry Nassar scandal at Michi-
gan State University. Many of these 
bills have support from both Demo-
crats and Republicans as well as sur-
vivors of Nassar. One of the bills, S.B. 
871, which was introduced by Repub-
lican state Sen. Margaret O’Brien of 
Portage, would erase the statute of 
limitations for second-degree crimi-
nal sexual conduct against a minor 
and would extend the statute for 
third-degree criminal conduct until 
the survivor’s 48th birthday or with-
in 30 years after DNA evidence iden-
tifies the perpetrator. Another bill, 
S.B. 872, introduced by Democratic 
state Sen. David Knezek of Dearborn 
Heights, would extend the statute 
of limitations for civil lawsuits as far 
back as 1997 for those who were sexu-
ally assaulted as minors.
State government matters, and 
who holds power can do great or ter-
rible things for the people of Michi-
gan. Luckily, Michiganders are going 
to elect a new governor and attorney 
general in November. All 148 seats in 
the state Legislature are also up for 
election. It is incumbent on everyone, 
regardless of partisan affiliation, to 
vote in the Aug. 7 primary and again 
in the Nov. 7 general election.
If you are going to be out of 
Michigan during the elections, 
you can still vote by absentee bal-
lot. The League of Women Voters 
Michigan is an excellent resource 
for those looking to learn how to 
vote. Whatever state you decide to 
vote in, please vote in these mid-
term elections.

OPINION

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I

t’s 2018 and this year we celebrated 
the 48th anniversary of Earth Day, a 
global day of recognition for environ-
mental protection. It also marks day zero 
of the Environmental Protection Agency 
“strengthening” the quality of science it 
uses to write new environmental rules, 
a decision made by EPA Administrator 
Scott Pruitt. “Strengthening” in this case 
means narrowing the scope of science 
available to the EPA to only findings that 
are reproducible and authentic, which 
may potentially violate the EPA’s pledge to 
use the best available science.
Recently, I was reminded by a CNN 
push notification that the health of my 
environment, as well as the integrity of 
my right to take action, is deteriorating. 
I immediately felt there was no legiti-
mate way for me to express my disdain 
for political decisions like this one. After 
reading, I interrupted my friend’s final-
paper-writing trance so she could com-
miserate with me in anger about the 
article. “Wow,” she sighed, “you should 
share that article on Facebook.”
This is “slacktivism,” or the watered-
down support for an issue that requires 
only the most minimal effort, such as 
expressing opinions on social media. This 
is how our generation takes action. Is it 
true that millennial Wolverines are lazily 
riding a ski lift up the activism mountain, 
while generations before us trekked and 
trudged to reach the top of it? It is possible 
we come off as the pre-cooked meals in 
the freezer section of Kroger that require 
minimal effort to enjoy – just two minutes 
of “labor.” We are to past generations of 
activists as EasyBib is to handwriting an 
APA-style reference.
Activists across the world gather 
annually on Earth Day in an attempt to 
harness the power necessary to keep the 
passion alive and stand up against envi-
ronmental injustice. But what classifies 
as standing up for the Earth? Is it when 
we stroll through the Diag and write 
down our uniqnames, signing up for the 
Planet Blue e-newsletter? Is it when we 
take a complimentary apple from a tent 
display and pledge to turn our lights off 
when we leave home? Yes, standing up for 
the Earth in 2018 is quite different than it 
was in 1970, especially on the University 
of Michigan campus – but how different?
“Slacktivism” on our campus, unfor-
tunately, casts a shadow on our school’s 
unparalleled legacy of student-driven 
action. In March 1970, U-M students 
organized a four-day-long series of 
events that revolved around taking action 
toward bettering their dirty surround-
ings. This “teach-in” served as a precursor 
to the first Earth Day just one month later. 
Students saw the potential for change, 
harnessed the success of the recent anti-
war student protests and shifted it to 
encompass the increasing momentum of 
passion for the environment.
The 1970 teach-in let students take 

action in a way that had never been done 
before. They enrolled in the brand new 
environmental law major and walked 
along the Huron River to protest its dete-
rioration. They took sledgehammers 
to a vehicle in the Diag that was facing 
a “trial and execution” for its pollution 
crime. They visited a former Ann Arbor 
Coca-Cola bottling plant and dropped off 
thousands of cans that were, at the time, 
non-returnable. They then picked up that 
mess of cans with their own hands.
Our generation has a slightly differ-
ent way of expressing disgust for the 
state of the environment and its policies, 
as shown by my friend’s suggestion to 
Facebook “share” the Pruitt article. We 
use our own two hands to type outraged, 
opinionated streams of consciousness 
onto Facebook, letting the world know 
our true opinions about who is respon-
sible for polluting what. We retweet digs 
at Pruitt that criticize his tactics, question 
his motives, and press for answers about 
the future of the EPA. However, we need 
to start doing the action ourselves — the 
criticizing, the questioning and the press-
ing for answers.
We’ve picked a bad time for action to 
shift to inaction, for correspondence with 
state senators to turn into retweets and 
Facebook shares. I say “bad time” because 
as a country, we exist in quite a tumultu-
ous environment, both environmen-
tally and politically. Just this past year, 
humans’ actions resulted in the inability 
to coexist with certain species and a cli-
mate disaster in Puerto Rico. The U.S. 
was one of the only countries to withdraw 
from the Paris agreement and remove 
itself from the pact to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. Not to worry — if all feels 
hopeless and degradation seems inevi-
table, check out the University’s sustain-
ability website, and explore the huge 
progress the University has made to bet-
ter the Earth and work toward our 2025 
campus goals. We’ve already succeeded 
in applying 40 percent less chemicals to 
the green of our campus, but we need to 
focus on recycling to reduce waste sent to 
landfills and walking or busing to class to 
reduce our carbon footprint.
April 22, 2018 has come and gone, 
sweeping like a whirlwind over our coun-
try and hitting Ann Arbor especially 
hard. The 48th anniversary of Earth Day 
should serve as our push-notification 
reminder to wake up and smell the roses, 
both figuratively and literally. We are 
now in the same position as the 1970 U-M 
undergraduates that spoke up for what 
they believed in and inspired a national 
movement. It is up to us: Do we want to 
be a generation of environmental activ-
ism or slacktivism?

‘Handmaid’s’ is 
uneven, urgent

When Margaret Atwood’s novel 

“The Handmaid’s Tale” was first pub-
lished in 1985, America was in her 
Reagan years. A fervent, nascent reli-
gious right, certain their politics were 
sanctioned by scripture, set forth to 
fundamentally 
reshape 
American 

public life. Last spring, Hulu’s TV 
adaptation of the novel debuted as 
the Moral Majority’s vision was real-
ized in the form of a 
Trump-Pence admin-
istration eager to stoke 
the flames of bitter 
culture 
wars. 
And 

now, the show returns 
to Hulu following a 
national cultural reck-
oning with systems of 
power and the men who exploit them. 

At its best, dystopia takes those 

elements of contemporary society 
to narrative extremes, unsettling us 
with their uneasy familiarity and leav-
ing us wondering: Could it happen 
here? Mary McCarthy wrote in her 
New York Times review of the novel 
that “The Handmaid’s Tale” lacked 
the “shiver of recognition” necessary 
to shock and warn, but the power of 
the show’s second season — more 
vivid and horrifying than the first — 
lies precisely in its ability to offer us 
a world that resembles ours; the sea-
son’s timely arrival in this political 
moment gives it a renewed sense of 
urgency and importance.

The first season of “The Hand-

maid’s Tale” ends where the novel 
did: The pregnant handmaid Offred/
June (Elisabeth Moss, “Mad Men”) 
steps into the back of a van, neither 
she nor the audience certain of her 
fate. This forces Season 2 to advance 
beyond the pages of the book and it 
quickly finds its footing as it expands 
Margaret Atwood’s world, fleshing 
out the oppressive, theocratic Repub-
lic of Gilead and venturing outside its 
walls. Emily (Alexis Bledel, “Gilmore 
Girls”), who befriended June last sea-
son, has been banished to the Colo-
nies, toxic concentration camps for 
failed handmaids and women who 
have sinned.

The introduction of the Colonies 

brings a new aesthetic dimension to 
an already visually sumptuous show. 
If the well kept households of the 
Commanders and their wives recall 
the painterly elegance of Vermeer, the 

Colonies are brought on screen in the 
style of Andrew Wyeth, muted and 
wistful, washed in gorgeous browns 
and pastels. Like in last season, the 
camerawork veers between portrait-
like and Kubrickian, using claustro-
phobic shallow focus to evoke the 
devastating personal wreckage of 
Gilead and crisp, haunting tableaus to 
remind of the regime’s sheer might.

Most striking are this season’s 

flashbacks, tender impressionistic 
scenes of life before Gilead. In the 

first season of “The 
Handmaid’s 
Tale,” 

these mostly served 
to establish relation-
ships and motivations. 
Now, they seem a bit 
more pointed — acting 
as roadmaps or whis-
pered 
warnings 
of 

how tyranny might slip into our world 
unnoticed. In one, June casually asks 
her husband Luke (O.T. Fagbenle, 
“Looking”) to sign a form so she can 
pick up her birth control prescription. 
In another, a stern nurse insists on 
calling June “Mrs. Bankole” despite 
June’s repeated reminders that she 
goes by her maiden name. This world 
on the brink of totalitarian takeover is, 
the show would like us to know, eerily 
similar to ours.

For all its quiet, poignant moments, 

though, “The Handmaid’s Tale” still 
suffers from a frustrating unwilling-
ness to leave anything up to the imagi-
nation. The first two episodes of the 
second season almost seem to revel in 
female pain, leaning fully into the sort 
of horror that felt far more understat-
ed last season. What should we make 
of a show that subjects its women to 
such brutality while basking in femi-
nist glory? Gendered violence is the 
defining feature of the lives of Gil-
ead’s handmaids — maybe the gore 
is a necessary evil — but the restraint 
with which it was depicted in the first 
season is so lacking now it verges on 
unwatchable.

Luckily, the show is grounded in 

lucidity by Moss, whose every line and 
glance are charged with an intensity 
and rawness that make this easily one 
of TV’s best performances. Her fellow 
Emmy winners Bledel and Ann Dowd 
(“Good Behavior”) as Aunt Lydia are 
mesmerizing to watch. It’s largely 
thanks to these leading actresses that 
“The Handmaid’s Tale” remains the 
most beautiful, searing show on tele-
vision. Praise be.

“The 

Handmaid’s 

Tale”
Hulu

Season 2 Premiere
 A week ago, The Daily spoke with 
alum Ryan McDonough, whose 
debut film “Groove” tells the story 
of Melanie, a street performer in 
New York as she prepares for a 
music competition. The film has an 
aura of reverence for New York City 
and features original music and 
recorded live in the New York sub-
way. McDonough graduated from 
the University in 2016 and went to 
work immediately on the film with 
fellow classmates. “Groove” is cur-
rently available on Amazon, iTunes, 
Xbox, Hulu, Google Play and Vimeo. 
In a phone interview with the Daily, 
McDonough spoke about the pro-
cess of making the film and shares 
his personal experience as a young 
filmmaker.
 The Michigan Daily: What was 
the process of creating “Groove”?
 Ryan McDonough: Me and my 
friends, from the beginning, were 
inspired 
by 
independent 
film-

makers like Joe Swanberg, Mark 
Duplass or Lena Dunham who 
thought that the only way to make 
a movie is by doing it. So, my junior 
year of college, toward the end of 
the year, me and Joe Biglan, who 
was the editor on the movie, got 
together and planned on making 
something within our means. That 
summer, I wrote the first draft of the 
script and my senior year, in the fall, 
I took an independent study class 
with Jim Burnstein and rewrote the 
draft under his mentorship.
 TMD: What were those plans? 
Were you working with anyone 
else?
 RM: We had a team of me, Joe Big-
lin, Nikki Horowitz and a few other 

people where we would meet once 
a week and figure out logistics. We 
changed things once we brought on 
Billy Offer and Zach Bruch, who are 
the two producers of the movie and 
Michigan kids too. They were very 
good about steering the direction 
of the movie and making it a reality. 
Our first big win was a grant from 
Panavision, who sent us a tractor 
trailer worth of equipment for free. 
It was insane.
 TMD: What came next?
 RM: Over winter break, Joe and 
I went back to New York, and to 
help prepare with the film, we 
interviewed a couple dozen subway 
musicians throughout the city to 
make the story more realistic. We 
then launched a kickstarter cam-
paign and raised about $20,000. 
We now had a decent-sized bud-
get, and recruited other kids in the 
Screen Arts and Cultures program 
at Michigan and some recent gradu-
ates so most of the crew was Michi-
gan students or recent alum. And 
then, instead of going somewhere 
for spring break, we posted the cast-
ing call back in New York every-
where online. We first filtered all 
the casting in Michigan, and then 
did in-person auditions in New York 
as follow ups.
 TMD: What was the process of 
auditioning roles? Who did you end 
up selecting?
 RM: All the main characters, most 
people and some of the core crew 
and cast members are actual musi-
cians that have performed on the 
subway. Our lead actress, she was a 
full-time musician before she got on 
Broadway. I was deciding between 
her and someone else and then saw 
a tape of her submission from NPR’s 
Tiny Desk and found that she was 

the voice. When I told her that 
she got the main role, we went 
to one of her concerts at Rough 
Trade records in New York to 
surprise her. She was playing the 
cello, but it was indie rock music, 
and I thought it was the most 
badass thing. We changed the 
story to fit around her. The char-
acter had to play cello.
 TMD: After the film was com-
pleted, what was the process of 
distribution?
 RM: After Joe and I edited 
it back at Michigan, there was 
a long period where nothing 
happened. We had an indus-
try screening in LA for a couple 
agencies in December. I naively 
assumed that I would shoot the 
movie right after college, that 
it would get into Sundance the 
following year and launch our 
careers. The idea for “Groove” 
first came about in April 2015 
and now it’s three years later, 
finally coming out.
 TMD: Did you play any fes-
tivals?

How does one review a film 

like “Avengers: Infinity War?” To 
list the cast would take half the 
article. Describing the plot in any 
kind of detail would be viewed as 
a colossal spoiler. It’s not trying to 
sell itself to newcomers because, 
by now, the entire world likes 
superheroes. A movie this big, with 
this many characters, attempting 
to make good on ten years worth 
of promises, simply cannot be 
reviewed as though it is any other. 
It 
is 
wholly 

unique 
both 

in 
terms 
of 

the 
Marvel 

Cinematic 
Universe 
as 
well 
as 

filmmaking at 
large.

Here’s the basic plot: Thanos 

(played via motion capture by 
Josh Brolin of “Hail Caesar!” in a 
make-or-break performance for 
the movie) has finally decided to 
get off his ass and collect the six 
infinity stones, mystical artifacts 
that, when collected together, allow 
one to control all of reality, time 
and space. The Avengers — led by 
Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., “The 
Judge”), Thor (Chris Hemsworth, 
“12 Strong”) and Captain America 
(Chris Evans, “Gifted”) — must 
unite with old friends and new in 
order to save not just planet Earth, 
but the entire universe. There are 
anywhere from a dozen to twenty-
some major characters in this movie, 
depending on who’s counting.

The storyline is broken up into five 

or six different narrative threads, 
following various groupings of the 
Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy 
and others as they work to either 

help or hinder Thanos in his plans. 
This leads to a large portion of the 
movie feeling very segmented as we 
bounce around the universe, often 
leaving people alone for 40 to 50 
minutes before returning to them. 
It’s easy at times to forget Iron Man 
or Captain America are even in the 
movie, not to mention the scores of 
secondary and minor heroes and 
villains who crop up to fight, die 
and fight again. The sheer scope 
is impressive, although it’s truly 
impossible to say how the film will 
land with any given group of people.

Conservatively, it’s safe to say 

true enjoyment of this 
movie is almost entirely 
dependent 
on 
how 

invested one already is 
in the Marvel universe 
and these characters on 
a personal level. Outside 
of Thanos himself (who 

is arguably the true lead character 
of the movie), no one character 
gets much of an arc or any kind 
of typical character development. 
“Infinity War” doesn’t even try to 
give all of these characters a story, 
counting on the previous 18 films to 
do the heavy lifting. The people who 
made this movie clearly believe the 
amount of buildup will allay some 
of the narrative shortcomings of the 
actual movie.

Part of the problem, then, is that 

the buildup to this film has, for the 
most part, been incredibly poor. 
Despite appearing as early as the 
original “Avengers” movie in 2012, 
Thanos himself has never received 
an ounce of characterization prior 
to now. In fact, the first act of this 
movie largely revolves around the 
heroes discovering his identity and 
his motives. For a villian who has 
been the subject of all that buildup, 
they should already know.

The opening sequence of this film 

also feels strangely out of step with 
last year’s “Thor: Ragnarok,” taking 
place seemingly seconds after that 
movie ended, but totally upending 
and destroying the entire purpose 
of that film in the process. This kind 
of poor planning is the main thing 
holding “Infinity War” back. It feels 
like an Act Two without a true Act 
One.

The MCU has for a decade 

coasted by on minimal stakes, 
maximum jokes. Now here comes 
an ending and the filmmakers have 
decided to get back to telling an 
actual story. However, the elements 
necessary to make the story work 
are 
missing, 
including 
under-

developed relationships that cause 
the two biggest emotional beats of 
the film to fall flat. When a major 
storyline depends on how much we 
care about C-listers like The Vision 
and Scarlet Witch, the audience 
starts to lose interest. Keeping every 
other film in the MCU exactly the 
same, this story would’ve worked 
better spread across three films, not 
two.

Despite being marketed as the 

end to a decade-long saga, “Infinity 
War” is only half a story. Like so 
many Marvel movies before, until 
we find out if the payoff is worth 
it, it’s hard to truly judge the film 
on its own. For the most adamant 
“Avengers” fans, “Infinity War” 
might just be enough. For everyone 
else, they’ve still got another year 
before they find out whether or not 
they’ve wasted ten years. Regardless 
of the eventual outcome, it’s clear 
Marvel really tried with “Avengers: 
Infinity War.” They wanted to make 
an epic that will stand the test of 
time. Next May, the world will 
finally know if they succeeded. It’s 
doubtless that many are already 
thinking about getting their tickets 
— all according to Marvel’s plan.

‘Avengers: Infinity War’ 
is expansive, yet patchy

FILM REVIEW

WALT DISNEY STUDIOS MOTION PICTURES

Ono’s debut is 
filled with spirit

Straight from the title, “Lion 

Cross Point” places high literary 
stock in animals. Birds, mammals 
and sea creatures populate its pages, 
enclosed by prose in this paper zoo. 
Monkeys stumble around backyards 
and graveyards, dolphins escape to 
the open ocean and an octopus is col-
orfully gutted and boiled. In up-and-
coming Japanese author Masatsugu 
Ono’s latest, the featured animals are 
more prevalent and intricate than 
most human characters.

The common bond that unites 

all animals of the novel is mystery: 
They are painted as 
murky, unknown sym-
bols obscured by the 
realities of life. As the 
reader puzzles over 
their 
significance, 

so does Takeru, the 
young protagonist of 
“Lion Cross Point.” 
Surprisingly 
and 

stoically silent for a fourth grader, 
Takeru spends the summer in the 
home village of his mother, living 
with his new caretaker Mitsuko 
and befriending his plucky neigh-
bor, the even younger Saki. While 
this sounds like the setup to a heart-
warming coming-of-age story, the 
weighty narrative is grounded in 
solemnity and poignancy.

Superficially, Takeru is a caring 

yet shy boy who loves Pokémon and 
baseball and is almost never seen 
without his FC Barcelona or Man-
chester United cap. However, the 
real Takeru, the Takeru who hides 
behind a façade of silence, is a child 
who’s been forced to grow up too 
fast. He’s been forced to bear wit-
ness to terrible domestic abuse and 
the psychological destruction of his 
mother who seemingly abandoned 
him. He’s been forced to assume the 
caretaker role for his older brother, 
who seems the younger because of 
his undetermined mental disability. 
Takeru is wrought by grief, anger, 
shame and regret, unable to over-
come his trauma due to his inno-
cence.

Perhaps that is why Takeru muses 

about animals so often — they are 
constant in their obscurity, unlike 
the people in his life who puzzle 
and confuse him with their oscillat-
ing decisions and personalities. The 

behavior of animals is essentially 
explained, but their purpose is not, 
leading Takeru to associate meaning 
however he sees fit. He dreams of 
an aquarium dolphin named John-
nie with purported healing powers 
and seeks comfort in a future trip 
to the idyllic “Dolphin Village.” He 
feels secure in a playground referred 
to as “Zebra Park” because of the 
presence of a plastic zebra next to 
the swings. He identifies two junior-
high girls with an alpaca and an owl 
as they unintentionally bring him to 
the verge of tears parroting about 
Johnnie’s disappearance from the 
aquarium. For Takeru, animals are a 
way to both liven his distressing life 

and soften the con-
stant fear he faces.

Translated spar-

ingly into English by 
Angus Turvill, the 
language of “Lion 
Cross Point” is at 
times 
strikingly 

minimalist 
and 

devoid of definition. 

Often a paragraph will be lost on the 
reader, floating away after initial 
consumption and clouding the sub-
stance of the writing. Ono also flirts 
with the premise of a supernatural 
ghost story at times as a strange fig-
ure by the name of Bunji inhabits 
Takeru’s memories and observa-
tions. This Bunji may or may not be 
the shade of a delicate youth who 
vanished long ago at the titular loca-
tion and eerily mirrors the brother 
of Takeru. This phantom narrative 
thread is never fully developed due 
to Ono’s conservative style, so it 
mostly ends up obfuscating the plot. 
Another source of confusion comes 
in the way Takeru is focalized; how 
the omniscient narrator relates his 
thoughts and actions and how he 
deals with hardships makes Takeru 
frequently seem like a middle-aged 
protagonist better suited for the oeu-
vre of Kenzaburo Oe.

While most of the novel’s prob-

lems stem from a lack of discernible 
detail, at points it purely clicks and 
introspective clarity is achieved from 
simplicity. There may be no hopeful 
future or happy ending in sight for 
Takeru — really, there’s no ending at 
all.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Thursday, May 3, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Released this April on Amazon 
Prime, 
the 
documentary 
series 
“All or Nothing: The Michigan 
Wolverines” follows the University’s 
football team from their spring trip to 
Rome to the 2018 Outback Bowl. The 
series offers glimpses of the lives of 
student athletes like leaders Rashan 
Gary, Karan Higdon and the various 

quarterbacks as well as the enigmatic 
Coach Jim Harbaugh. Amazon paid 
the University over $2 million for 
the rights to create this must-watch 
series for fans of Michigan football. 
Recently, The Daily had a chance 
to speak with director Jim Jorden 
about tackling this ambitious project.
The Michigan Daily: How did 
the idea for this documentary come 
about?
Jim Jorden: Amazon has a series 
with the NFL called “All or Nothing.” 

A couple years ago, the first one came 
out with the Arizona Cardinals. 
When I watched that show, I 
thought, “Wow, this would be a 
perfect distribution model for college 
football.” Usually these shows run 
once a week as the season goes on or 
maybe a one-hour episode when the 
season’s over. This was eight one-
hour episodes that came out half a 
year later. As a storyteller, you have a 
chance to look at all the material for 
the whole season and shape the story 
in a special way. And with eight hours, 
you have the time to tell a really good 
story. I thought we should try to do 
this for college football. I arranged 
a meeting with Amazon. They 
were interested in three programs: 
Alabama, UCLA and Michigan. 
Amazon liked Michigan best based 
on the alumni, winningest team of 
all time and how interesting Coach 
Harbaugh is, especially as a dad with 
four young kids. But for covering 
college, they’re kids. The thing you 
always have to keep in mind is in the 
NFL, they’re pros and it’s a job, but in 
college they’re students. A big pitch 
for the project was wanting to put the 
“student” back in student athlete and 
“college” back in college football. We 
really tried to show the whole college 
experience.
TMD: What were the logistics 
of covering such a large team and 
organization?
JJ: I helped start “Hard Knocks” 
back in 2001 with the Baltimore 
Ravens. 
When 
we 
did 
“Hard 
Knocks” each year with the NFL and 
HBO, we would come in with a small 

army and take over. The college 
setting is so intimate, so we wanted 
to be a fly on the wall with a small 
group. We only had two cameras and 
relied heavily on Michigan’s internal 
camera staff to help us with footage. 
We didn’t have a big crew at all. And 
when you’re shooting over the course 
of a whole football season, you don’t 
have to shoot so much stuff. We have 
sayings like, “don’t shoot everything, 
shoot the right thing.” Then when 
we edit, “work with what you have, 
not what you don’t have.” We didn’t 
want to shoot a ton of stuff or bother 
people, just be at the right place at the 
right time and document the right 
things. We wore Michigan gear. We 
really were a part of the Michigan 
team. We’ll all be fans of Michigan 
forever now because you get to know 
everybody, and you understand 
where they’re coming from.
TMD: Did you use your own game 
footage?
JJ: We tried to never use 
anything shot by a network. We shot 
everything ourselves because we 
shot with a different style. I found 
that shooting sports comes down 
to three things: lenses, angles and 
film speed. You can have the same 
camera standing next to the same 
person, but if they’re shooting at 
different speeds it looks different. If 
one person’s down lower or higher, it 
looks different. We tried to capture 
the games in a way that TV doesn’t 
do: A lot closer, a lot more personal. 
We wanted it to feel like you’re on the 
sidelines.
TMD: A lot of the intimate 

interviews happened in cars as the 
subjects were driving around Ann 
Arbor. Why did you choose this set 
up?
JJ: One thing that Amazon was 
really keen on was never having an 
interview where anybody spoke in 
the past tense like I’m doing now. 
Sometimes in this show, you’ll see 
really well lit interviews where it’s 
taking place after the actual filming 
is done. Amazon didn’t want to have 
that and there wasn’t time to take out 
of someone’s schedule for interviews 
like that. We just filmed it on the 
fly, while we’re going around. A car 
was a great time to talk to somebody 
because we’re just driving, they can 
just talk as they drive and it’s not 
distracting. A lot of times there’s 
interviews with guys just sitting in 
the field. We were just trying to get 
everybody right in the moment.
TMD: Something that really 
struck me were the class differences 
between players and, essentially, 
why they play. There was a sharp 
contrast between Rashan Gary and 
his mother eating at Red Lobster, 
while Wilton Speight and his 
girlfriend ate out at Black Pearl. Was 
this comparison intentional? And 
were there other greater themes you 
wanted to convey?
JJ: We just followed people around 
wherever they naturally wanted to 
go. We weren’t from Ann Arbor so 
for me there wasn’t any difference 
between restaurants.

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

On the Words I Can Never Tell My Mother

There exists this word, or 
sentiment, 
in 
Vietnamese: 
“đau khổ.” Individually, the 
words translate to “pain” and 
“suffering”, yet together, they 
form something along the 
sense of an intense anguish 
that transcends any attempt 
at a linguistic description. It’s 
more than just the sum of both 
pain and suffering, but rather, 
it’s this profoundly unsettling 
and deep-rooted unhappiness; 
it is a pain without promise. 
The phrase carries with it this 
intensity even in how it is pro-
nounced; the harshness of the 
first letter in “đau” followed 
by the hauntingly questionable 
nature of the tone mark that is 
placed on “khổ”. Đau khổ is 
something best felt, rather than 
described, but I can’t really 
comment on how efficacious it 
would be to write this piece to 
serve as an avenue towards the 
feeling of this sentiment, so for 
now, my descriptive explana-
tions will have to suffice. 
My mother grew up as the 
eldest and least appreciated of 
five children. She was never 
supposed to have moved any 
further than the steps outside 
of her parent’s home. She had 
every expectation to stay back 
and care for her own parents 
and live a life of ennui in the 
same town she was born in, 
and yet somehow, some hap-
penstance chain of events inev-
itably allowed her to come to 
America. She wasn’t expected 

to amount to anything more 
than just a simple woman liv-
ing a simple life, but here she 
is, living with her husband and 
children in a home that nobody 
from her family back in Viet-
nam could ever dream of own-
ing.
As a child of war, my moth-
er was born in the midst of the 
most violent events to occur 
in Vietnamese history. She 
came of age during these grue-
some years, and it was as if she 
was never able to live a child-
hood independent of đau khổ. 
All she ever knew from the 
moment she was brought into 
this world was both pain and 
suffering. 
I remember stories that 
she would tell me while I was 
growing up; stories of how she 
saw the decayed corpses of 
soldiers being driven back en 
masse to her small town all to 
be redistributed back to their 
respective families. These sol-
diers weren’t people anymore. 
They were just vessels of rot-
ting flesh waiting to be returned 
like property. She would tell 
me that she still remembers the 
stench, that disgustingly famil-
iar aroma of death and decay. 
These things never really left 
her. I can’t imagine how things 
like that could ever leave a per-
son, but despite these hardships 
and horrors, she endured and 
overcome so much. 
There is so much of her life 
that I don’t know about. There 
is so much about my own 
mother that I still don’t know 
about. I want to understand her 

on a deeper level as I continue 
to grow into adulthood, but I 
have to come to terms with the 
fact that by doing so, I would 
be forcing her to revisit some 
of the most traumatic events 
she has ever witnessed. I don’t 
want to hurt her. I don’t want to 
pry. She saw so many horrific 
things during this war. She was 
only six years old then. 
To say that I can empathize 
with my mother’s own đau khổ 
would be a stretch of the truth. 
I don’t think I’ll ever be able to 
comprehend the magnitude of 
pain and suffering she has so 
carefully kept hidden from me. 
The horrors of war, the tragedy 
and loss of seeing her entire 
country crumble before her 
eyes, the despair and discrimi-
nation she faced at the hands 
of the communist government; 
these were all kept a secret 
from me until I was taught 
about them in school. 
I understand that people 
choose to cope in different 
ways, but I don’t really know 
what to even call this. I can’t 
blame her for anything she 
chooses to do, or rather, not 
do. It would be unfair of me to 
decide on how my own mother 
chooses to cope with trauma 
I could never even begin to 
grasp.
In 1998, my parents were 
given the opportunity to immi-
grate to the States. This was a 
pretty late time to come to the 
United States in comparison 
to the Vietnamese refugees 
who came here after the Fall of 
Saigon on the 30th of April in 

1975. While a community was 
being built in Grand Rapids by 
refugees who had been able to 
make a living and thrive, my 
parents would be thrown into 
it with nothing to their names 
except the ill-fitting clothing 
given to them by others who 
had come here first. 
Neither 
of 
my 
parents 
attained anything above a high 
school education in Vietnam. 
The communist government 
barred my family from obtain-
ing any form of higher educa-
tion. It was a punishment they 
felt fit the “crime” of my grand-
father holding a major position 
in the South Vietnamese army. 
My mother left behind the only 
life she ever knew in a blind 
attempt toward the promise of 
a brighter future. She boarded 
the plane en route to the US, 
cradling me in her arms, not 
knowing when she would ever 
see her family again. Not being 
able to speak English, she 
would do her best to find any 
work in order to support us. 
I don’t have it left in me any-
more to try and mask the trag-
edy she has had to face with 
beautiful words. My mother 
has suffered through so much 
for me. 
My mother is still afraid 
to go to stores alone. She’s 
been living in this country for 
almost two decades, but she 
is still so flustered whenever 
she has to speak in English. I 
don’t want anyone to judge her. 
I love her so much. I still go 
with her to the bank and Mei-
jer to translate for her when-

ever I am home because of the 
stares. People don’t look at her 
how I look at her. They see 
her as somebody burdened by 
the inability to speak English. 
She tells me about their tone; 
the glares of disapproval and 
the judgment she hears when 
she stumbles on simple ques-
tions while grocery shopping. 
If only they knew how bright, 
wonderful and loving she was 
in Vietnamese.
These are all things I would 
like to tell my mother some-
day. I think it’s a combination 
of a language barrier and an 
emotional barrier. I don’t have 
the vocabulary necessary to 
tell her these things, and she 
doesn’t have the emotional 
capacity to liberate herself 
from past trauma. It always 
brings her to tears. I take after 
my mother a whole lot. Every-
one around her has always told 
her that I was born in the exact 
image of her. Sometimes I look 
at pictures of myself as a child 
and I can really see the resem-
blance. 
As I’ve grown older, I’ve 
come to realize that my cop-
ing mechanisms mirror those 
of my mother in exactly the 
same way that my face mir-
rors hers. My mother internal-
izes so much of the pain she 
has encountered and continues 
to encounter in her life. She 
builds walls around this pain 
so that, while she won’t be able 
to see them, they continue to 
exist. I wish I could explain to 
her the concept of closure or at 
least the semblance of such an 

idea in a way she could under-
stand. 
My whole life has been built 
around a series of these walls. 
All of my life I’ve dealt with 
the inability to connect with 
my parents in the same way 
others did. Friends would often 
complain about how overbear-
ing their parents were, but I 
distinctly remember longing 
for a life in which over-com-
munication with my parents 
was a burden. It’s something 
I’ve learned to internalize as 
well. I wish things were dif-
ferent. 
As selfish as this may sound, 
I’ve found that one of the major 
reasons why I want to under-
stand my mother’s struggles 
and trauma is that in doing so, 
I believe that I can begin to 
understand myself on a deeper 
level as well. I always won-
der why I am the way that I 
am. Perhaps my mother could 
answer these things for me on 
the off chance that we can find 
a mutual avenue of communi-
cation that lacks the barriers 
and obstacles we currently 
face. 
Despite these difficulties, I 
know that the most significant 
piece of knowledge that we 
share with one another is the 
mutual understanding that I 
love her very much. I will never 
be able to thank her for the lit-
eral life she has given me and 
the life I continue to live to this 
day. Her story teaches me that 
even in the deepest trenches 
of đau khổ, there always exists 
some form of hope.

‘M’ falls in Big 
Ten Tournament

By BAILEY JOHNSON

Daily Sports Writer

Mattias Siimar was down 5-3 in the 
second set of his singles match, and the 
No. 3 seed Michigan men’s tennis team 
needed him to win to move ahead of 
No. 6 seed Wisconsin in the quarterfi-
nals of the Big Ten Tournament.
The freshman battled back and 
won four straight games on his way to 
a 6-4, 7-5 match win in the fourth spot 
of the singles lineup. The victory pro-
pelled the Wolverines to a 4-1 win over 
the Badgers to advance to Saturday’s 
semifinal, where they fell to No. 2 seed 
Illinois, 1-4.
“That was a big win for (Siimar), 
winning that match on Friday,” said 
Michigan coach Adam Steinberg. “It 
was great for his confidence. He lost 
to that guy pretty badly a week before, 
two weeks before, so that was huge for 
him and the team.”
Friday’s quarterfinal began with 
Michigan’s No. 2 and No. 3 doubles 
pairs winning their matches — senior 
Alex Knight and freshman Harrison 
Brown by a score of 6-2 and the nation’s 
72nd-ranked pair senior Runhao Hua 
and Siimar 6-3. The wins secured the 
doubles point for the Wolverines, put-
ting them at a 1-0 advantage early.
“We’ve won, I think, seven or eight 
doubles points in a row now,” Stein-
berg said. “It’s been a big boost for us. 
Obviously on Friday — the first round 
of the Big Ten tournament for us — it 
was really important.”
Senior Carter Lin notched the first 
singles win of the day for Michigan 
with a straight-set win at the No. 5 
singles spot. His match was close — 
6-4, 6-4 was the final score — and 
foreshadowed a tight day for the Wol-
verines.
Junior Myles Schalet lost his match 
in three sets, giving up the only point 
of the day for Wisconsin. Knight, Hua 
and senior Davis Crocker all took their 
first sets to tiebreakers, but all three 
won those tiebreakers to go up a set on 
their opponents.
Michigan’s best chance to advance 
to the semifinals rested on the shoul-
ders of Knight. After winning his tie-
breaker, Knight fought for a 6-4 win in 
the second set to earn the individual 
match victory and secure a win that 
would not have come without strong 
play from the bottom half of the lineup.
“I think we have some of the best, 
if not the best depth of any team in the 

country,” Steinberg said. “The bottom 
of the lineup is so strong that we have a 
lot of confidence in those guys. .”
Saturday’s competition began with 
Michigan winning the doubles point 
once again. But another day of tight 
matches in the singles play came just 
after that, and this time, things didn’t 
go the Wolverines’ way. They didn’t 
win a first set in the singles play, set-
ting them up for a long day.
Schalet lost a lopsided singles match 
1-6, 0-6 — by far the most unbalanced 
loss of the competition for Michigan — 
and that quick loss allowed the Illini 
to tie the match early. Knight lost in 
straight sets as well to give Illinois a 
lead that the Wolverines were unable 
to overcome.
Lin lost a quick first set 2-6, then 
came back to win the second set, 6-2, 
and give Michigan an opportunity at 
its first singles win of the day. But Lin 
dropped the third set 3-6, and the Wol-
verines were in trouble.
Both Hua and Siimar got up 4-1 in 
their first sets, but neither could main-
tain the lead and lost the set, Hua 5-7 
and Siimar in a tiebreaker. Hua recov-
ered to win the second set, 6-4, but his 
match went unfinished in the third 
set when Siimar lost his match to end 
Michigan’s day.
Siimar once again found himself 
down 3-5 in the second set, but his 
comeback to tie the set at 5 games 
apiece fell short as he lost his match 
6-7 (2-7), 5-7.
“We were up in a couple of them big 
and losing those first sets after win-
ning the doubles point was not how we 
planned it, that’s for sure,” Steinberg 
said. “It hurt us. We couldn’t recover, 
and we tried to come back, and we did, 
you know, Davis came back, and (Hua) 
came back, and Carter came back, but 
it was just a little too late. We needed 
to grab a couple of those first sets and 
really put pressure on Illinois, and we 
couldn’t close it out, and that’s why we 
went home early.”
Closing out tight matches will 
become even more important for the 
Wolverines with the NCAA Tourna-
ment coming as the next — and final 
— event of their season.
“We need a little more belief when 
those moments come,” Steinberg said. 
“There’s going to be adversity, espe-
cially in the NCAA Tournament when 
it’s win or go home, so we have to stick 
together and play the Michigan way, 
no matter if we’re up or down.”

Wolverines shatter records

MEN’S TENNIS

By JACOB KOPNICK

Summer Managing Sports Editor

In a sport designed to highlight 
individual achievement, teamwork 
and camaraderie are often over-
shadowed.
For the Michigan men’s throw-
ing unit, the opposite is true. The 
tightly bound crew together soars 
through the highest of highs and 
suffers through the lowest of lows, 
constantly feeding off the success of 
their teammates.
Perhaps the most apt display of 
this unit cohesion occurred this 
past weekend at the National Relay 
Championships at Arkansas.
The relay meet — the ultimate 
test of togetherness — scored only 
the running relay events with all 
other athletes essentially compet-
ing in open competition.
Heading into the meet, the 
throwing unit was completely 
aware that every throw through-
out the day would not be counted 
towards the team’s score and would 
only serve as a testament to its com-
mitment to the sport.
In light of this, the throwers 
delivered their greatest perfor-
mance of the season and shattered 
the Wolverine record book.
Leading “The Meat Factory,” as 
they have so fittingly dubbed them-
selves, was senior Joe Ellis who 
shattered his own school record in 
the hammer throw twice and ended 
the weekend with a winning bomb 
of 72.16 meters. In his conquest, 
Ellis also humbled a pair of top-
ranked throwers from Florida.
“It’s all about competing,” Ellis 
said. “Those guys have a lot of years 
under their belts. They’re both from 

Europe and started from a young 
age and had a significantly higher 
PR than me, so it’s one of those 
things where you never like not 
being the top-ranked guy going into 
a meet, so both of those guys had a 
bulls-eye on their backs.”
One of the Florida throwers, 
Anders Eriksson, took the lead 
heading into the event’s finals. Ever 
a flare for the dramatic, Ellis over-
came him with the record-shatter-
ing throw.
Setting a record of his own and 
contributing to the ethos of “The 
Meat Factory” was junior Andrew 
Liskowitz.
Not to be outdone by his team-
mate, Liskowitz delivered two 
back-to-back 
record-breaking 
throws in the shot put to not only 
win the event, but move within four 
centimeters of the 2018 national-
leading throw. Liskowitz finished 
with a throw of 20.28-meters and 
a statement to the collegiate throw-
ing community.
While not setting a school 
record, senior Grant Cartwright set 
a personal record with a 67.12 meter 
hammer throw to add an exclama-
tion point on his unit’s weekend.
“The Meat Factory’s” success 
could be attributable to an entire 
season of hard work and training, 
the energy that the squad gives 
each other—or a mix of both. What-
ever it was, there is no denying the 
chemistry between the teammates 
and how the athletes feed off it.
“We’re pretty much just always 
in each other’s corner and it’s a very 
special relationship,” Ellis said. 
“It’s definitely something that I’ve 
never been a part of in sport before 
coming to this school and it’s defi-

nitely boosted me to do better than 
I would’ve thought possible, espe-
cially considering the small amount 
of time we’ve actually been train-
ing.”
Beyond training, the group of 
throwers all live together to create 
the ultimate culture of brotherhood 
and success. This particular type 
of bonding has clearly produced 
promising results and is something 
Michigan coach Jerry Clayton 
hopes to distribute to other event 
areas.
“They push each other both in 
practice and in the weight room, 
but they all live together too, so 
they’re all focused and the culture’s 
there,” Clayton said. “So the whole 
team needs to do that and that’s 
what we’re looking to do in other 
event areas as well.”
From here, the throwing squad 
appears to be in an ideal condition 
entering the big postseason meets 
beginning with the Big Ten Cham-
pionships in two weeks.
“Tomorrow’s gonna be a super 
heavy lift,” Ellis said. “You gotta set 
your nervous system back so you 
can be super prepared for when our 
conference meet is, and then it’s just 
finalizing technique, working on 
the rhythm of the throw. You can’t 
make many too many major chang-
es two weeks out, so you just gotta 
get ready for the event and then go 
in with a very expectant attitude 
and just do what your training has 
taught you to do and just compete.”
Granted that they stick to what 
they’ve been doing, “The Meat Fac-
tory” will stake their claim not only 
in Michigan history, but in NCAA 
throwing history as well.

Jesse Franklin’s incredible freshman turnaround

By THEO MACKIE 

Daily Sports Writer

Before the six home runs 
in nine games and before 
the back-to-back Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week 
awards, Jesse Franklin sat 
quietly in the dugout of Jet 
Blue Park in Fort Myers, 
Florida, waiting for a pass-
ing thunderstorm to sub-
side. He was coming off a 
disappointing junior year 
and needed to make the 
most of the summer show-
case circuit to impress col-
lege coaches.
As it turns out, the 
coach 
Franklin 
wanted 
to impress most was 1300 
miles away. As he waited for 
play to resume, his phone 
buzzed with a call from an 
unknown number and only 
one piece of information—
the location, ‘Ann Arbor, 
Michigan.’
On the other end of the 
phone was Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. By the time the 
storm abated and Franklin 
returned to the field, he had 
found his top choice school.
“Honestly, I had never 
really thought about Michi-
gan (until then),” Franklin 
said. “ … (But) from that 
point 
on, 
(Bakich) 
was 
really honest and really 
straightforward with me 
and believed in me. And 
that’s the main reason that I 
picked Michigan.”
Across the country, Max 
Engel, 
Franklin’s 
high 
school coach at Seattle 
Prep, was out working in his 
driveway when he received 

the call from Bakich.
The two talked for an 
hour and a half, about 
everything from baseball 
to schoolwork to Franklin’s 
work ethic and relation-
ship with his teammates 
and family. Much like his 
star outfielder, Engel left 
the conversation sold on the 
Wolverines.
“I thought he asked all 
the right questions,” Engel 
said. “… I walked away from 
that phone call feeling like 
that would be a great place 
for Jesse.”
A former first baseman 
at Santa Clara University, 
Engel knows the impor-
tance that coaching has on 
a college player’s develop-
ment. So when big name 
schools in California and 
the SEC came calling dur-
ing 
Franklin’s 
dominant 
senior season, Engel con-
tinued to push Franklin 
toward Ann Arbor.
While he felt coaches at 
those programs merely had 
Franklin’s name on a list of 
equally talented outfield-
ers, Bakich showed both the 
coach and player a unique 
sense of caring about the 
individual.
“In all of my interactions 
with coach Bakich,” Engel 
said, “you walk away feeling 
that he really has the best 
interest of these players in 
mind and that he’s gonna 
build a program around car-
ing for the person.
“And I think to Jesse, 
that’s something that really 
appealed to him.”
Just a month into his 

college career, that mind-
set began to reap benefits 
for Franklin. 14 games into 
the Wolverines’ season, the 
freshman’s batting average 
sat below .100, with four 
times as many strikeouts as 
hits.
Like most coaches would 
have, 
Bakich 
reduced 
Franklin’s role, and he saw 
just eight at-bats over an 
eleven game stretch in early 
March. But unlike other 
coaches, Bakich had the 
faith in his freshman to give 
him another shot.
***
Four years earlier, Frank-
lin made his high school 
debut when Engel needed 
a player and the JV coach 
recommended him. That 
afternoon, he started for 
varsity 
against 
Andrew 
Summerville, a Stanford-
bound senior at the time. 
Franklin, a freshman who 
had been on JV that morn-
ing, notched two base hits.
The next year, he broke 
out with a .532 average as a 
sophomore and was named 
to the Seattle Times’ all-
area team. His performance 
dipped a little his junior 
year, which Engel attri-
butes to increased expec-
tations, 
before 
winning 
Gatorade Player of the Year 
in the state as a senior with 
a .557 batting average, 20 
extra-base hits and just two 
strikeouts.
“We probably knew (he 
was special) that day when 
we called him up,” Engel 
said, “and he cemented his 
spot in the lineup but it sure 

was a thrill watching him 
develop and get better and 
better and better each year.”
His performance was so 
dominant that by the end of 
his senior year, he personal-
ly knew most Major League 
Baseball area scouts in the 
pacific 
northwest. 
Engel 
estimates six to 12 showed 
up to every game, often 
requiring Franklin to take 
special batting practice.
Once, Engel took his seat 
on a ferry ride to a game 
and was approached by two 
scouts, swarming him with 
questions until the boat 
reached shore. Somehow, 
Franklin never felt the pres-
sure.
“I didn’t care what they 
thought because I was just 
gonna come here,” Franklin 
said. “But the day Bakich 
came to see me, I was kinda 
messed up.”
Last year, Seattle Prep 
did a service event with 
an agency called Bridge of 
Promise to play baseball 
with youths and adults with 
disabilities. Franklin dedi-
cated his day to a kid named 
Dillon, who could not hold a 
bat at the beginning of the 
afternoon. By the end of the 
day, he was able to hit soft 
toss pitches.
A month later, Frank-
lin won Gatorade Player 
of the Year and made the 
accompanying donation to 
Bridge of Promise. After the 
original donation, Franklin 
chose to write an optional 
essay describing his expe-
riences with Dillon and 
ultimately won Gatorade’s 

essay contest, earning the 
charity an additional 10,000 
dollars.
***
Whether it was his atti-
tude or work ethic that 
caused 
his 
turnaround, 
Franklin quickly flipped the 
switch.
“He really showed us—
myself, the coaches, his 
teammates—a lot when he 
started off the season very 
poorly,” Bakich said. “He 
had adversity for the first 
time and that’s where you 
find out a little bit about 
yourself.
“He was not only work-
ing on his swing and his 
defense but he’s working on 
his speed, he’s out pushing 
sleds, he’s just very driven, 
very driven kid to succeed. 
He showed everybody a lot 
with that work ethic and 
that consistency, and he just 
has a drive to be great.”
Franklin’s drive is not 
just a simple ploy to win 
more playing time. Engel 
describes Franklin as the 
rare star who is also the 
team’s 
most 
coachable 
player. Even in high school 
when he was hitting over 
.500, Franklin was always 
the one grabbing gear and 
hustling on and off the field.
So when he was confront-
ed with a slump that may 
have derailed many fresh-
men’s seasons, nobody close 
to him was surprised when 
Franklin remained unfazed.
“I knew that little slump 
wasn’t going to hold up,” 
Engel said. “And then when 
he got hot, it was like ‘there 

it is, he’s figured it out.’
“Everyone back home, we 
all kind of knew, that’s not 
gonna last.”
After not appearing at 
all in a weekend series 
against Bowling Green in 
mid-March, Franklin estab-
lished himself in Michigan’s 
lineup the following Tues-
day against Oakland in fit-
ting fashion. He blasted his 
first career home run the 
opposite way to left field — 
something he and Engel had 
worked on together every 
batting practice.
“I’m sure if (Engel) was 
here, he’d like that,” Frank-
lin said.
Since 
then, 
Franklin 
is hitting .369 with eight 
home runs. Seven of those 
shots, along with 27 runs 
batted-in, came in just a 
16-game stretch. He has 
been named Big Ten player 
of the week, won three of 
the last four freshman of 
the week awards, and is the 
front-runner to be crowned 
the conference’s freshman 
of the year.
Franklin’s ultimate goals, 
though, extend far beyond 
personal accolades. For the 
first-year, putting his team 
on the map is paramount— 
not just in collegiate base-
ball circles, but in Ann 
Arbor as well.
“I really want to go to 
Omaha … because we want 
people to take Michigan 
baseball seriously.”
If the slugger keeps up 
his tremendous play, Frank-
lin’s wish just may become 
reality.

Patterson given immediate eligibility

By MAX MARCOVITCH

Daily Sports Editor

The wait is over — and 
it’s just the news Michigan 
has been waiting for.
Quarterback Shea Pat-
terson will be eligible to suit 
up right away, providing a 
sizeable boost to the Wol-
verines’ quarterback depth 
chart. He will have two 
more years of eligibility, 
after spending two seasons 
at Ole Miss.
The 
NCAA 
granted 
the 
redshirt 
sophomore 
immediate eligibility after 
reviewing 
his 
waiver, 
which detailed misguid-
ance from the previous 
Rebels staff about impend-
ing NCAA sanctions dur-
ing Patterson’s recruitment. 
In December 2017, Ole 
Miss was hit with a host 
of restrictions, including a 
two-year bowl ban. In that 
18-page decision, the NCAA 
wrote, “Ole Miss lacked 
institutional control and 
fostered an unconstrained 
culture of booster involve-
ment in football recruiting.”
Patterson announced in 
December he would trans-
fer from Ole Miss to Michi-
gan, with the question of his 
eligibility still in the air. 
He 
and 
his 
lawyer 
appealed to waive the nor-
mally-mandated 
redshirt 
season for a transfer, on the 
grounds that he was misled 
by the Ole Miss coaching 
staff — a claim the Rebels 
initially objected to. The 
Wolverines 
announced 
Friday afternoon the two 
schools worked together 

in the “last several days” to 
put forth a joint waiver for 
Patterson’s eligibility. As a 
result, Michigan withdrew 
its previous waiver and sub-
mitted the new one.
Friday, 
the 
NCAA 
approved 
that 
waiver, 
granting 
Patterson 
the 
immediate eligibility he — 
and the Wolverines — cov-
eted.
“That new application 
was submitted this week 
by the University of Michi-
gan and supported by both 
schools,” 
the 
statement 
reads. “The University of 
Michigan has withdrawn 
its previous waiver appli-
cation and all associated 
materials in favor of this 
new, cooperative approach 
based on facts which all 
parties agree to. The waiver 
has now been approved by 
the NCAA and thus foot-
ball student-athlete Shea 
Patterson will be eligible to 
compete in the 2018-19 aca-
demic year.
“Both schools are ready 
to move forward and appre-
ciate the assistance of the 
NCAA staff in bringing 
this matter to a resolu-
tion. While the process has 
been complex at times, the 
solution was simple - two 
flagship universities and 
the NCAA staff working 
together with a focus on 
student-athlete well-being.”
Patterson’s abilities, and 
his wealth of accolades, 
have been well document-
ed. He brings a five-star 
pedigree — and a year of 
SEC experience — to the 
Wolverines’ 
quarterback 

room. In seven games as 
the starter last season, 
Patterson completed over 
63 percent of his passes, 
throwing for 2,259 yards 
and 19 touchdowns. All 
three of Michigan’s start-
ing quarterbacks combined 
for just 2,226 yards and nine 
touchdowns in 13 games 
last season.
“Everybody gets excited 
when he’s out there,” assis-
tant coach Pep Hamilton 
told reporters last week. 
“If he makes a special play 
you can feel the energy 
throughout our team, you 
can just feel it… and he is a 
playmaker.”
Patterson will walk in 
the favorite to start Septem-
ber 1 at Notre Dame, though 
it’s too soon to annoint him 
just yet.
Hamilton went on to say 
all four quarterbacks — Pat-
terson, redshirt sophomore 
Brandon Peters, redshirt 
freshman Dylan McCaffery 
and freshman Joe Milton — 
were splitting reps evenly, 
both in terms of sheer num-
bers and with the first team. 
When 
asked 
when 
he’d like a frontrunner to 
emerge, Hamilton promply 
replied, “Yesterday.”
All of that is to say, Pat-
terson won’t merely waltz 
to the top of the depth 
chart. He will have to beat 
out Peters and McCaffery, 
fairly and squarely.
Peters, to his credit, has 
a year of experience in the 
system — one that produced 
freshman-esque ups and 
downs a season ago. His 
six starts showed signs of a 

potential long-term starter 
at times, and causes for con-
cerns at others. And McCaf-
fery has done nothing but 
impress since he stepped 
foot on campus, claiming 
the offensive scout team 
player of the year in his red-
shirt season a year ago.
But these are good prob-
lems to have. Patterson’s 
presence alone provides a 
significant boon to a posi-
tion group that has expe-
rienced its fair share of 
inconsistency over recent 
years. 
Either way, in 121 days 
Michigan will walk out on 
the field at Notre Dame sta-
dium to take on the Fight-
ing Irish. And the Shea 
Patterson era will begin.
“There are a lot of people 
who worked really hard 
to help make this transfer 
process a success. I want 
to thank Coach Harbaugh, 
the University of Michigan 
and the NCAA for allowing 
me to continue my educa-
tion and football career at 
one of the best universities 
in the country,” Patterson 
wrote in a statement Fri-
day afternoon. “A special 
thanks to Michigan’s Com-
pliance Staff and to (Patter-
son’s lawyer) Tom Mars for 
his personal guidance for 
me and my family during 
this time. With this deci-
sion behind us, my family 
and I are fully focused on 
the upcoming season. My 
teammates and I are always 
committed to competing at 
the highest level and win-
ning championships. Go 
Blue!”

SOFTBALL

‘M’ has timely hitting 
against Spartans in win

EAST LANSING — It was the 
top of the fourth inning, and 
another opportunity was about 
to slip away.
Leading off the inning in 
a scoreless tie, junior center 
fielder 
Natalie 
Peters 
had 
singled just past the shortstop. 
Then, a hard line drive off the 
bat of senior first baseman Tera 
Blanco dropped just inside the 
foul line for a double. The No. 
14 Michigan softball team (16-2 
Big Ten, 41-9 overall) was in 
business.
But 
a 
walk 
by 
junior 
catcher Katie Alexander was 
sandwiched by a popout and a 
strikeout, and suddenly there 
were two outs and still no runs 
and one last chance to make 
something out of the inning.
Sophomore left fielder Haley 
Hoogenraad took the first pitch 
she saw into right field for a 
single. Two runs scored, and 
instead of a wasted chance, 
the Wolverines had a rally. 
What had been a pitcher’s 
duel became a one-sided affair 
halted only by the run rule, as 
Michigan defeated Michigan 
State (7-11, 21-25), 8-0, in five 
innings.
Through 
the 
first 
three 
innings, the Wolverines and 
Spartans 
traded 
outs 
back 
and forth. At-bat after at-bat 
for Michigan resulted in a 
groundout. 
Michigan 
State 
struggled 
to 
muster 
even 
that — freshman left-hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien 
struck 
out four Spartans in the first 
three innings, and the lone 
baserunner she allowed was 
gunned down trying to steal 
second.
“(Beaubien) 
was 
efficient. 
She got ahead,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “ … She 
did a good job with managing 
the zone.”
With 
Beaubien 
keeping 
Michigan State locked down, 
all the Wolverines needed was a 
little offense. But timely hitting 
was something Michigan had 

struggled at times to find, and 
when second and third with no 
outs turned into bases loaded 
with two outs, it seemed it 
would escape the Wolverines 
once again.
Then Hoogenraad broke the 
stalemate.
“Haley really is kind of our 
silent assassin in a way,” Blanco 
said. “She always gets a clutch 
hit.”
And 
once 
Hoogenraad 
broke through, it didn’t take 
her teammates long to break 
the 
stalemate. 
Sophomore 
designated 
player 
Thais 
Gonzalez tacked on another run 
on an infield single to make the 
score 3-0.
After Beaubien set down 
the 
next 
three 
batters 
in 
order, Michigan kept riding 
its momentum. Junior second 
baseman Faith Canfield, Peters 
and Blanco loaded the bases 
on two singles and a walk. 
Sophomore 
third 
baseman 
Madison Uden singled Canfield 
and Peters home. Alexander 
lined a triple into the right 
field corner — scoring Blanco 
and Uden — and scored herself 
when the throw went into the 
dugout. By then, the score was 
8-0.
“We basically attacked more, 
hit the first good one, and that 
really helped,” Blanco said. “ … 
And once one person gets a hit, 
and two hits in a row, it’s kind of 
contagious in that way.”
What had a mere two innings 
earlier been a tie game was now 
a blowout, and all Beaubien had 
to do was throw a scoreless 
bottom of the fifth to end the 
game and secure a run-rule 
victory.
The 
first 
two 
Spartans 
reached base, but Beaubien was 
unfazed. Two strikeouts and a 
fielder’s choice later, she sealed 
the deal.
