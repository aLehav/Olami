Regents to approve
appointment for University
Provost Phil Hanlon
Beginning on May 6, Hanlon
will cede his current role to the
incoming provost, current Vice
Provost Martha Pollack, who
was appointed to the position in
January. Before leaving the Uni-
versity to become the 18th presi-
dent of Dartmouth College later

appointment.
"Provost Hanlon has gracious-
ly agreed to provide counsel and
advice during the transition to
help assure administration con-
tinuity," Coleman wrote.
In a November interview with

"terrific opportunity." Hanlon

sity's faculty since 1986.
"I love the University of
Michigan," Hanlon said. "I have
the greatest admiration for the
place; I admire what it aspires

Police officers react to a second explosion at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday.
Marathon ends in tragedy

At least three dead,
140 hurt; known

By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily News Editor
In what major news outlets
and some officials are calling
a terrorist attack, two large
explosions left a devastating
scene near the finish line of the

Boston Marathon as some run-
ners ended the race. As of 2 a.m.,
at least three people - including
an 8-year-old boy - were killed
and more than 140 injured.
The definitive cause for the
explosions is not yet clear, and
no groups or individuals have
claimed responsibility yet for
the incident. The FBI has taken
charge of the investigation.
In an address to the nation
Monday evening, President
Barack Obama said those

responsible for the bombings
will "feel the full weight of jus-
tice."
Investigators found at least
two unexploded bombs near
the finish line, but those devices
were safely unarmed, accord-
ing to a senior U.S. intelligence
official, who also spoke to the
Associated Press on condition of
anonymity because of the con-
tinuing investigation.
More than 500 Michigan
residents qualified for the mara-

thon, according to RunMichi-
gan.com. Fifty-six were from
Ann Arbor.
No current University varsity
athletes were running in the
marathon, University spokes-
person Rick Fitzgerald wrote in
an e-mail.
According to Brad Rudner, a
University athletics spokesman,
two former Michigan women's
soccer players ran, but they both
finished before the blasts.

Michigan Robotics Day not only pro-

the opportunity to showcase their work,
butit also gave the state's leaders a chance
to emphasize how important robotics
will be for Michigan's economic future.
The third-annual Robotics Day event,
held as apartofNationalRobotics Week,
was held Monday at Michigan Stadium's
Jack Roth Stadium Club and was co-
hosted by the University and the Nation-
al Center for Manufacturing Sciences.
Gov.RickSnyder deliveredthekeynote
address at the event and said he wants
Michigan to be at the forefront in devel-
opingrobotics technology. To do so, more
students need to be inspired by science,
technology, engineering, and math edu-
cation and its related efforts, he said.
Snyder added that robotics technol-
ogy will play an important role in the
state's and a variety of industries' efforts
with autonomous vehicles - new cars in
development that can operate automati-
cally without human input. The gov-
ernor called these autonomous vehicle
programs "the gift that keeps on giving,"

Hundreds protest cuts to
DDA at councimeeting

Agency could
lose funds for
supportive housing
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
The crowd at Monday
night's Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil meeting measured in the
hundreds - a stark difference
to the usually meager atten-
dance.
The majority of those in
attendance came to speak
out against proposed cuts to
the Downtown Development
Authority's funding. Most of
the protestors speaking out
against the ordinance were
from Dawn Farm, a tran-

sitional housing center for
recovering substance addicts,
which receives some funding
from the DDA. Others came
to speak out about similar
concerns over the possibility
of decreased funding for low-
income and homeless hous-
ing. As of 2:20 a.m. Tuesday,
the ordinance was still being
debated.
The ordinance, sponsored
by Councilmembers Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) and
Sumi Kailasapathy (D-Ward
1), would mandate that a
recent growth in tax incre-
ment funding - the increase
in taxes from property devel-
opment - should be reallo-
cated to the city and other
taxing, public entities rather
than the DDA. Under the cur-

rent law, the DDA receives all
of the TIF funds, expected to
grow to $4.8 million over the
next two years.
While the proposal con-
tains other changes, the
reallocation- of funding is
the most significant - and
controversial - change. The
proposal states that surplus
funds not used in compliance
with the TIF plan must be
refunded to individual tax-
ing entities. Under the plan,
cuts to the DDA would be very
likely, if not inevitable, and
many citizens are worried
the cuts would directly affect
the homeless through cuts
to affordable and alternative
housing like Dawn Farm.
Mayor John Hieftje said he

BREAKING UP

Ann Jeffers is an assistant pro-

Why did you decide to get into

I got into engineering in gener-

science in high school, and the

do is helping people, and that was

Council debates plans for
high-rise, TDX construction

Due to long talk on
DDA funding, issues
still not debated as of

Daily StaffReporter
A vote on the hotly debated 413
E. Huron St. plan was still being
decided as of 2:20 a.m. Tuesday at
Monday night's Ann Arbor City
Council meeting.
The plan would allow for the
construction of a 14-story high-
rise apartment building with an
underground parking structure
in the Dl zone. The building
would provide housing mainly for
University students.
Law Prof. Don Duquette told
councilmembers the high rise
would further the concept of Ann
Arbor as a "student ghetto" and
would damage the city's aesthetic

appeal.

streetriots
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -
Venezuela's government-friend-
ly electoral council quickly
certified the razor-thin presi-
dential victory of Hugo Chavez'
hand-picked successor Monday,
apparently ignoring opposition
demands for a recount as anti-
government protests broke out
in the bitterly polarized nation.
People stood on their balconies
in Caracas apartment buildings
banging pots and pans in protest
as the electoral council's presi-
dent proclaimed Nicolas Maduro
president for the next sixyears.
Across town, thousands of
students clashed with National
Guard troops in riot gear who
fired tear gas and plastic bul-
lets to turn the protesters back
from marching on the cIty cen-
ter. Students threw stones and
pieces of concrete.
The city was otherwise
peaceful, although protests
were reported in provincial cit-

ies. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
Maduro was elected Sunday
by a margin of 50.8 percent
to .49 percent over challenger
Henrique Capriles - a differ-
ence of just 262,000 votes out
of 14.9 million cast, according
to an updated official count
released Monday.
Sworn in as acting president
after Chavez's March 5 death
from cancer, Maduro squan-
dered a double-digit advantage
in opinion polls in two weeks
as Capriles highlighted what
he called the ruling Chavistas'
abysmal management of the
oil-rich country's economy and
infrastructure, citing myriad
woes including food and medi-
cine shortages, worsening power
outages and rampant crime.
By' contrast, Chavez had
defeated Capriles by a nearly
11-point margin in October.
Until every vote is counted,
Venezuela has an "illegitimate
president and we denounce that
to the world," Capriles tweeted
Monday.
One of the five members of
the National Electoral Council,
independent Vicente Diaz, also
backed a full recount, as did the

United States and the Organi-
zation of American States.
But the' electoral council
president, Tibisay Lucena, said
in announcingthe outcome Sun-
day that it was "irreversible."
At the proclamation ceremony
Monday, she called Venezuela
"a champion of democracy" and
defended its electronic vote sys-
tem as bullet-proof.
Capriles, a 40-year-old state
governor, had demanded the
proclamation be suspended.
He convoked the pot-banging
protest and asked supporters
to gather outside the electoral
council Tuesday.
Capriles claimed that mem-
bers of the military, "an impor-
tant group in various cities,"
had been detained for trying to
guarantee a free and fair elec-
tion. He said they had been
ordered to ignore abuses they
witnessed. Capriles did not
offer further details, such as
how many were involved.
He said a vote count by his
campaign produced "a differ- 0
ent result" and it received more
than 3,200 complaints of irregu-
larities - all by pro-government
forces. He demanded every sin-
gle ballot be recounted.

NEWS BRIEFS
LANSING
No layoffs from
federal budget cuts
Automatic federal budget cuts
will cost Michigan $150 million
in funding for programs such as
special education and a cloth-
ing allowance for needy kids,
but none of state government's
48,000 employees will lose their
jobs, the state announced Mon-
day.
About $20 billion, or 42 per-
cent, of the state's $48 billion
budget comes from federal funds
- a concern for state officials
ever since the automatic spend-
ing reductions began taking
effect more than six weeks ago.
Gov. Rick Snyder's adminis-
tration said the most significant
direct cut is to a program that
will not be able to provide about
$137 at the start of the school
year to each of 21,000 chil-
dren living with relatives after
being removed from their home.

Edin Kapidzic fought in Croa-

Years after returning from the
front lines, the former soldier
from eastern Croatia hanged
himself in a park in the home-
town he defended during the
1991-95 conflict, part of the
wider disintegration of the for-
mer Yugoslavia. Kapidzic left
behind a wife and four children.
But no suicide note.
He was among nearly 2,000
Croatian war veterans who have
killed themselves since war
ended in the Balkan country of
4.2 million, which is now slated
to join the European Union. An
estimated 1,000 people com-
mit suicide each year in Croa-

During holiday, Korea
calm after threatening war

Festivities continue
despite potential
missile launch
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - North Koreans cel-
ebrated the birthday of their
first leader Monday by danc-
ing in plazas and snacking on
peanuts, with little hint of the
fiery language that has kept the
international community fear-
ful that a missile launch may be
imminent.
Pyongyang fired off a rocket
ahead of the last anniversary of
Kim Il Sung's birth - the cen-
tennial - but this time the day
was simply the start of a two-
day holiday for Pyongyang
residents who spilled into the
streets.
Girls in red and pink jackets
skipped along streets festooned
with celebratory banners and
flags and boys on inline skates
took a break to slurp up bowls
of shaved ice.
There was no sense of panic
in the North Korean capital,
where very few locals have
access to international broad-
casts and foreign newspapers
speculating about an imminent
missile launch and detailing
the international diplomacy
under way to try to rein Pyong-
yang in.
Elsewhere in the region,
however, the focus remained
on the threat of a launch as U.S.
Secretary of State John Kerry

wrapped up a tour to coordi-
nate Washington's response
with Beijing, North Korea's
most important ally, as well as
with Seoul and Tokyo.
In Seoul, South Korean
Defense Minister Kim Kwan-
jin told a parliamentary com-
mittee Monday that North
Korea still appeared poised to
launch a missile from its east
coast, though he declined to
disclose the source of his infor-
mation.
Kerry warned North Korea
not to conduct a missile test,
saying it would be provocation
that "will raise people's temper-
atures" and further isolate the
country and its impoverished
people. He said Sunday that
the U.S. was "prepared to reach
out," but that Pyongyang must
first bring down tensions and
honor previous agreements.
Foreign governments have
been trying to assess how seri-
ously to take North Korea's
recent torrent of rhetoric
warning of war if the U.S. and
South Korea do not stop hold-
ing joiet military maneuvers
just across the border.
Officials in South Korea,
the United States and Japan
say intelligence indicates
that North Korea, fresh off
an underground nuclear test
in February, appears ready
to launch a medium-range
missile. North Korea has
already been slapped with
strengthened U.N. sanctions
for violating Security Council
resolutions barring the regime

from nuclear and missile activ-
ity.
North Korea has warned
that the situation has grown
so tense it cannot guarantee
the safety of foreigners in the
country and said embassies
in Pyongyang should think
about their evacuation plans.
But British Foreign Secretary
William Hague said Monday
that although there is reason
for concern over the "frenetic
and bellicose" rhetoric, Brit-
ain believes there has been "no
immediate increased risk or
danger" to those living in or
travelling to North Korea.
He said Britain does not
see an immediate need to
draw down embassy staff,
but is keeping that under
constant review. He added
that, from discussions with
other governments, the U.K.
does not believe any foreign
embassy in Pyongyang plans
to close.
While concerns over North
Korea continued to dominate
headlines abroad, Pyongyang's
own media gave little indica-
tion Monday of how high the
tensions are.
The Rodong Sinmun, the
Workers' Party newspaper, fea-
tured photos and coverage of
current leader Kim Jong Un's
overnight visit to the Kumsu-
san mausoleum to pay respects
to his grandfather. There was
only one line at the end of the
article vowing to bring down
the "robber-like U.S. imperial-
ists."

British police
prepare heightened
security for
Sunday's marathon
LONDON (AP) - British
police are reviewing security
plans for Sunday's London Mar-
athon, the next major interna-
tional marathon, because of the
bombs that killed two people at
the race in Boston. But there is
no known specific or credible
threat against the hugely popu-
lar British race at the moment,
a security official said Monday.
Police already were preparing
a major security operation for
Wednesday's ceremonial funer-
al for former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, an event at
St. Paul'sCathedral that will be
attended by Queen Elizabeth II
and many dignitaries. The plans
call for a procession through the
streets of London, with Thatch-
er's flag-draped coffin to be car-
ried on a horse-drawn carriage.
The funeral's security plans
are expected to be reviewed in
light of the Boston bombings.
London has long been con-
sidered a top target for inter-
national terrorists, with the
government saying the threat
level is "substantial." In 2005, a
series of suicide attacks on the
public transport system in the
British capital killed 52 people.
London and mainland Britain
also face a moderate threat from
Northern Ireland-related ter-
rorism, according to the govern-
ment.

Two bombs exploded near
the finish of the Boston Mara-
thon on Monday, killing two
people and wounding more
than 80 others, race organizers
and police said. The situation
sparked alarm bells in Britain,
where a massive security opera-
tion was put in place last sum-
mer to protect the successful
London Olympics.
Last year, some 37,500 ath-
letes competed in the London
Marathon, with many more
watching the springtime event.
Chief Superintendent Julia
Pendry, police commander for
the London race, said Mon-
day that "a security plan is in
place for the London Marathon.
We will be reviewing security
arrangements in partnership
with (the) London Marathon."
A police spokesman who
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because he was not autho-
rized to go on the record said
the security presence may be
increased.
A security official, speak-
ing on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized
to speak publicly about the mat-
ter, said there are no credible or
specific threats against the Lon-
don Marathon.
The London race's chief
executive, Nick Bitel, said mar-
athon officials contacted the
police to discuss security plans
"as soon as we heard the news"
about Boston. He expressed
shock and sadness about the
situation in Boston, saying "it
is a very sad day for athletics
and for our friends in marathon
running."

BP manager testifies
at trial over oil spill

$500 million Wrigley Field
renovation headed to court

Detailed plans
for stadium get
heat from rooftop
owners
CHICAGO (AP) - The Chica-
go Cubs have been fighting for
years to get back to the World
Series. They may have a fight on
their hands to upgrade Wrigley
Field, too.
The Cubs unveiled details
Monday of their' $500 million
plan to renovate the 99-year-
old ballpark. It calls for more
night games, a new hotel, a new
clubhouse, extended beer sales,
various upgrades for fans -
and a massive electronic video
screen that could spark a legal
battle with rooftop owners who
have a financial stake in being
able to view the games from
across the street.
The proposed 6,000-square-
foot screen in left field is nearly
three times as large as the ven-
erable scoreboard currently
atop the centerfield bleachers.
Team chairman Tom Ricketts
said "significant" advertising-
related revenue from the video
screen and a 1,000-square-foot
sign in right field would be
pumped back into the team.
"If this plan is approved, we
will win the World Series for
our city," Ricketts of the Cubs,
who have not won it all since
1908 and haven't played in the
series since 1945.
The Cubs say rooftop views

would be "largely preserved"
and that the sign and screen
are "far less than our origi-
nal desire for seven signs to
help offset the costrof ballpark
restoration." Ricketts would
not say what the team means
when it says the signs would
have "minimal impact" on the
views from the rooftops. Nor
would he discuss the likeli-
hood of a lawsuit, saying only
that "we will take that issue as
it comes."
The rub is that the rooftop
owners have a contract with
the Cubs in which they share
revenue from the rooftop seats
- an unusual arrangement, to
be sure. The rooftop owners
have 11 years remaining on the
contract, and they showed no
sign of endorsing the big new
signs the Cubs want to put up.
"We have a contract with the
Chicago Cubs and we intend
to see that it's enforced," said
Beth Murphy, who owns roof-
top bleachers and Murphy's
Bleachers, a popular tavern
just beyond Wrigley's center-
field wall. "We have fulfilled
our end of the contract, we pay
them 17 percent of our gross
revenues every year."
Murphy said the rooftop
owners were shut out of nego-
tiations between the city and
the team. She said she couldn't
imagine how a 6,000-square-
foot sign - slightly more than
a tenth of an acre - could be
installed without disrupting
views from the rooftops.
Ricketts said the two sides

have a ways to go, that the
agreement must be approved by
city planners and the City Coun-
cil. But he said Mayor Rahm
Emanuel and the alderman
whose ward includes Wrigley
Field, Tom Tunney, support the
overall plan. The mayor's office
has, in fact, agreed the signs can
be installed, but there has been
no agreement on size or design.
Only Boston's Fenway Park is
older than Wrigley Field among
major league parks. Baseball
purists love its intimacy -.the
ivy-covered walls, the commit-
ment to day games - but the
team says it spends $15 million
a year just to keep up with basic
repairs and desperately wants
new revenue to pay for new
amenities. A better showplace
could perhaps help the Cubs
snap a World Series champion-
ship drought that dates to 1908,
six years before Wrigley was
built.
Under the plan, the num-
ber of night games could be
increased from 30 to 40, and
construction would include a
175-room hotel, an office build-
ing with retail space and health
club, and 1,000 "remote" park-
ing spots that would be free
and come with shuttle ser-
vice. Emanuel has hailed the
"framework" agreement, not-
ing that it includes no taxpayer
funding.
If the deal wins approval
from city officials, Ricketts
said work could begin after
this season ends and be com-
pleted over the next five years.

Manager had no
safety concerns for
oil rig despite last
minute changes
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A BP
team leader who supervised man-
agers on the oil rig that exploded
in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 tes-
tified Monday that he was frus-
trated by last-minute changes
to the drilling project, but didn't
have any safety concerns before
the deadly blast.
John Guide was BP's wells
team leader for the Deepwater
Horizon project and supervised
two rig managers who have
been indicted on manslaugh-
ter charges in the deaths of 11
workers. He was the first wit-
ness to testify during the eighth
week of a federal trial seeking
to assign responsibility for the
disaster.
The explosion that killed
the rig workers triggered the
nation's worst offshore oil spill.
Barring a settlement, U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Carl Barbier, who
is hearing testimony without
a jury, could decide how much
more money BP and its contrac-
tors owe for their roles in the
catastrophe.
' In an email three days before
the April 20, 2010, blowout
of BP's Macondo well, Guide
complained about last-minute
changes and warned his boss,
David Sims; that the operation
wouldn't succeed if it continued
"in this manner." Guide sent
the email after learning about a
change in the plan for cement-
ing BP's Macondo well.
"David, over the past four
days there has been so many last
minute changes to the operation
that the (BP rig managers) have
finally come to their wits end.
The quote is 'flying by the seat
of our pants,"' Guide wrote.
Plaintiffs' attorneys have
claimed that email shows BP sac-
rificed safety in a rush to com-
plete a project that was behind
schedule and millions of dollars
over budget.
Guide, however, testified that
the concerns he expressed in his
April 17 email had nothing to do

with safety. Guide said he never
tried to cut corners to save money
or pressured rig crew members
to speed up operations so the rig
could move on to drilling another
well.
"Safety was the number one
priority," he said.
Guide said he sent the April
17 email after learning that BP
planned to add 30 barrels of
"spacer" during the Macondo
well's cementjob.Aspaceris aliq-
uid used to separate other liquids
from each other.
"I didn't know about this," he
recalled. "I was surprised."
, Robert Kaluza and Donald
Vidrine, BP's well site leaders on
the rig at the time of the explo-
sion, have pleaded not guilty to
manslaughter charges and await
a separate trial. An indictment
last year accuses Kaluza and Vid-
rine of botching a key safety test
and disregarding abnormally
high pressure readings that were
glaring signs of trouble before the
blowout.
Guide said he spoke to Vidrine
on the morning of April 17 and
discussed the last-minute chang-
es to the drilling plans.
"Mr. Vidrine was frustrated,"
he recalled. "He made the com-
ment that it just seemed like try-
ing to put all this stuff together
made him feel like he was flying
by the seat of his pants."
. Guide said he also discussed
his concerns with Brian Morel, a
BP engineerontheproject,before
sending the email to Sims.
"Everybody wants to do the
right thing, but, this huge level
of paranoia from engineering
leadership is driving chaos,"
Guide wrote in the email. "Brian
has called me numerous times
trying to make sense of all the
insanity."
More than a month before the
blowout, Sims wrote but never
sent a scathing email in which
he accused Guide of criticizing
"nearly everything we do on the
rig" without accepting responsi-
bility for his role in supervising
the operation.
"You are always defensive and
the victim. You seem to not want
to make a decision so that you
can criticize it later," Sims wrote
in the email, one of several testy
exchanges he had with Guide.

Illegal' no more
Changes in Associated Press styleguide on the right side of history
n Tuesday, April 2 the Associated Press updated their style-
book to end the use of the term "illegal immigrant." Used
by U.S. newspapers as a guide for editing style and content,
the changes made in the stylebook come at the height of immigra-
tion debate in Congress. The official removal of illegal immigra-
tion from the AP's guide should be reflected in national rhetoric, as
newspapers nationwide begin to use more inclusive, less accusatory
language to describe undocumented immigrants. Stigma surround-
ing immigration has propelled misunderstandings to the forefront of
debate, and newspapers should be quick to adopt this policy in order
to encourage more accurate discussion of the issue.

Though the changes may have implications
to nationwide debate, the AP claims that this
change was made not for political reasons
but because the term "illegal immigrant" is a
legally inaccurate denomination. "The Sty'le-
book no longer sanctions ... the use of 'illegal'
to describe a person," AP said in a statement
last week. By changingtheir preferred termi-
nology, the AP confirms that while an action
may be considered "illegal," a person cannot.
Though some have criticized the revision as
excessively politically correct, the changes
allow for more factually accurate reporting
of a critical talking point across the country.
In its statement on the language change,
the AP endorsed "undocumented immi-
grant" as the current preferred terminology.
The adoption of undocumented immigrant
isn't just more precise, but more acceptable.
While the media isn't responsible for push-
ing a more progressive understanding of
immigration, newspapers do play a signifi-
cant role in not only disseminating informa-
tion, but also establishing the words we use
to describe news stories. Word choice mat-

ters, and language can generate harmful ste-
reotypes and stigmas. Whether or not they
acknowledge it, the AP made a step toward
eliminating divisive terms nationwide.
While the AP sets the standard for news-
papers in the United States, individual papers
and magazines may choose whether they fol-
low the guidelines. In this case, newspapers
across the nation slould endorse the changes
made by the AP and abide by the new style.
Newspapers have a great impact on language,
and reflecting such a change in print can
prompt changes in how the average Ameri-
can perceives immigration issues.
This new decision comes at a time when
immigration has become a hot-button issue
for legislation President Barack Obama has
made immigration a large part of his sec-
ond-term agenda, and currently a biparti-
san group of senators are working on a new
immigration bill. The current work being
done on immigration in Washington D.C. and
the new change to the AP Stylebook indicates
that progress is being made towards a more
nuanced understanding of immigration.

PATRICK BAUMHART I
No ethics in sight

President Coleman,
In the past weeks I have been following the
fallout stemming from the Central Student
Government elections. Amid the allegations of
voter coercion and mismanagement of election
funds, I came to the disheartening conclusion
that there's a major problem on our campus - a
problem that often goes unacknowledged. The
matter in question is this: Nobody ever seems to
talk about ethics until after someone has done
something wrong.
The CSG election code is meant to estab-
lish a base level of ethical integrity, one that
is expected to be used in carrying out a cam-
paign. It presents candidates, whether run-
ning as an independent or a member of a
party, with a universal standard that's meant
to be upheld by all parties involved. Yet in my
time at the University, I've only seen it used
as a device to disqualify the opposition. I'd
like to believe that all representatives in the
legislative branch of our system are commit-
ted towards the betterment of our commu-
nity, but from reading the various responses
issued by some of the main political parties
on campus it has become clear that our gov-
ernment has fallen victim to many of the
same petty squabbles that we see in the parti-
san-dominated U.S. government.
A similarly dismal state of affairs can be
associated with the academic honor code and
the lack of knowledge that the average student
has regarding the code. Outside of the required
comment on academic integrity that seems to
be the mantra of every "Syllabus Week," most
students only become acquainted with the
honor code after being told that they've been

suspected of violating it. In coupling this with
the increasing trends of honor code violations, I
believe that a growing issue is present here.
I believe that the true issue at hand is that
there's a lack of discourse and awareness
directed toward the broader topic of ethics.
Students need to come to the realization that
all of their actions have potential ethical impli-
cations, and with those implications comes an
association that's bigger than themselves. As
we enter the workforce our actions are not only
representative of our own ethical standard, but
it also reflects on the ethical integrity of the
greater University community.
I write to you because as the president of the
University, you have a vested interest in main-
taining the quality of its reputation. I also write
to you because you once took a strongstance on
the importance of ethics by leading an initia-
tive for the creation of the Center for Ethics in
Public Life. More significantly, when the center
was closed in 2011, University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald issued a statement saying that, "the
evaluation was that its mission of ethics in pub-
lic life was now embedded in the community,"
and that "the provost's office believed that
would be sustained without having a specific
center focused on that."
Regretfully, I now say that whatever under-
standing of ethics that was then instilled in the
community is no longer present in the actions
of our students. We've reached an impasse in
our campus community; I fear that honor and
ethics are now principles found only in history
and literature.
Patrick Baumhart is an LSA sophomore.

Before I announced my candida-
cy for president of Central Student
Government, I called my friend
Chris Osborn to let him know I
would be running with youMICH.
He offered me the same courtesy
before he announced he would be
running with forUM. We wished
each other well and expressed a
mutual desire to work together
again next year, regardless of the
outcome. A little over a month ago, I
truly believed the campaign would
be quick and fun. I thought my
friendship with Chris would trickle
down to our respective parties and
create a friendly rivalry as we com-
peted to lead CSG.
I never could have predicted
this outcome. In an election that
garnered the most votes in the his-
tory of student government at the
University, my running mate Bobby
Dishell and I took second place to
Osborn and his running mate, Hay-
ley Sakwa. But due to a unanimous
ruling by the University Election
Commission that Chris and Hay-
ley influenced students while they
were voting, I am set to take office
as president of the CSG.
Many have said I sued my way
into office. Technically, that's true
- but in doing so, an incredibly
important rule was enforced. The
will of an individual in the voting
booth has to be protected. The pri-
vacy of an individual, acting alone,
exerting his or her will in the demo-
cratic process is precisely what puts
the voter in charge of the process.
There's a reason candidates cannot
Tragedy in Boston

community
TO THE DAILY:
"Explosion at the Boston Mara-
thon" - my stomach churns as I take
in the headlines. The footage of the
explosion sends shivers down my
spine. I can't help, but feel a mixture
of sheer disgust, sadness, confusion
and helplessness. My heart becomes
filled with sympathy for the victims
and their families. Again and again
the same three words keep running
through my mind: "Who does this?"
Having been.a competitive run-
ner for-almost half my life, I know
the impact of Monday's incident

enter the voting booth with voters.
Now, I don't think Chris set out
with the intention of breaking
this rule. I think he felt passion-
ately about the issues and wanted
to share that enthusiasm with as
many voters as possible. I think
he got caught up in the excitement
of the campaign and made a mis-
take. Ultimately, it's impossible to
quantify how much of Chris and
Hayley's 485-vote margin of vic-
tory would have been erased had
they not employed that illegal cam-
paign strategy. I personally main-
tain Bobby and I would've won, but
you're free to disagree. Many do.
Whatever your belief, it's true
that I will be the constitution-
ally legitimate president of CSG in
about one week's time. This isn't
how I thought I would take office,
tbut I'm excited for the opportunity.
And I'll work my tail off for the stu-
dents of the University for the next
year, whether they voted for me or
not. It's time to move past the elec-
tion. It's time to get to work on all
the fantastic initiatives that were
campaigned on this year.
Bobby and I have already begun
laying the groundwork for an off-
campus bus route, the Student Orga-
nization Sorting Hat Survey and the
Mcard mobile app. We've met with
administrators this week to present
our plan for a degree-granting entre-
preneurial learning community. We
have been in the Duderstadt from 2
a.m. until 5 a.m., gauging demand for
a 24-hour cafe on North Campus.
But those are just our initiatives.

The fact that the legislature and
executive branches, will be split
between forUM and youMICH
offers an exciting opportunity for
CSG to work hard on both parties'
goals. forUM brings a multitude of
great ideas to the table, and I par-
ticularly admire their passion for
environmental sustainability and
diversity. I look forward to working
with the forUM representatives, as
well as Chris and Hayley, to develop
a strategy for reducing the Univer-

BOSTON
From Page 1
Cellular phone reception was
very weak in the Boston area
following the attack, so many
individuals involved resorted
to e-mail or social media to let
their loved ones know they were
all right.
Business graduate student
John Maxey - who has run in the
Boston Marathon twice before -
finished the race, then returned
to Ann Arbor in time for class. He
wrote in an e-mail that he was
shaken by the attacks, especially
since his family had attended his
previous races.
"The idea of (my family)
waiting at the finish for me is
too much to contemplate now,"
Maxey wrote. "My little boy is 10
months old and it gives me anew
perspective on the whole thing."
Maxey wrote that he had no
intention of letting the attack
change how he conducted his
daily life.
"I refuse to let these wacko
outliers create that environ-
ment, and I refuse to live in
fear," he wrote. "Making it back
to class now seems so trivial,
but the idea that I would let this
sicko change my plans for me, or
make me whole up watching the
revolving on the news for hours
on end, I refuse to do it."
Rackham student Jessie
Benaglio wrote in an e-mail his
parents were cheering for him
at the line as he finished his first
Boston Marathon. They were
back at the hotel when they
heard the explosions.
"We tried to leave for the
airport right away because we
had no idea what was going on,"
Benaglio wrote. "It was very
scary and I can't believe anyone
could do this to such a presti-
gious event."
Incoming graduate student
Aaron Kosel also ran in the mar-
athon.
"I was two blocks away. The
blasts shook the building I was
in and they evacuated everyone,
so I am fine. Everyone I know

who ran finished well before the
explosion," Kosel wrote in an
e-mail. "It's pretty horrifying."
Rackham student Mike
Waterson finished the race
and was just leaving the finish
recovery area when the explo-
sion went off a few blocks away.
He said the people around him
didn't understand the gravity of
the situation as first responders
began arriving.
"It sounded almost like a can-
nonball getting shot off," Water-
son said.
Waterson said leaving the
city was difficult because most
public transportation was shut
down.
Nursing gradate student
Danielle Hainer signed up and
practiced for the marathon but
didn't end up participating due
to a knee injury.
"I now feel that maybe it was
meant to be that I not go,' Hain-
er wrote. "I was anticipating on
finishing around 4 hours. Explo-
sions went off a little after the 4
hour mark. Very scary stuff."
Meredith Barrett, a general
surgery resident at the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System,
also ran in the marathon and
wrote that she and her family
were safe.
"It was horrible," Barrett
wrote.
Rackham student Joshua
White finished the race and was
recovering in a nearby cafe when
the incident occurred. He wrote
in an e-mail that the whole situa-
tion felt "surreal" and noted how
social media played an impor-
tant role in keeping his loved
ones informed.
"My first reaction was shock,
and then honestly the first thing
I did was post on Facebook that
I was okay," White wrote. "It's
amazing how much social media
and texting played a part in this.
It was impossible to get calls
through."

REGENTS
From Page 1
until May 31.
Gelman appointed
interim dean of LSA
The regents will also vote on
the appointment of University
psychology professor Susan Gel-
m~n as the interim dean of LSA.
Gelman's term will last from Sept.
1 to Aug. 31, 2014.
Gelman is currently the Heinz
Werner Collegiate Chair of Psy-
chology and LSA Professor of Psy-
chology, with tenure. She earned
a B.A. in psychology and classical
Greek from Oberlin College and
later received her Ph.D. in psy-
chology from Stanford University.
She has been a University faculty
member sine 1984.
Teaching both graduate and
undergraduate classes, Gelman's
studies and classes focus primar-
ily on the development of thought
and language, particularly with
youngchildren. She has published
over 200 scholarly articles and
has been on the editorial boards
for multiple scientific journals.
In addition, she was a panelist for
the National Institute of Health,
the National Science Foundation,
and the Ford Foundation. Gelman
has previously served as president
of the Cognitive Development
Society and, in 2012, was elected
to the National Academy of Sci-
ences.
At the University, Gelman has
served as an adviser to under-
graduate, graduate and doctoral
fellows, receiving the Develop-
mental Psychology Mentor Award
from the Americati Psychological
Association in 2012. She was also
awarded theixcellence in Educa-

tion Award, presented by LSA in
1995.
Gelman has also served as a
member of the LSA executive
committee and as an associ-
ate LSA dean frorn 2004-2007,
responsible for faculty appoint-
ments and research in the social
sciences. In this capacity, she
supervised faculty hiring, promo-
tions and retirements, in addi-
tion to encouraging mentoring,
faculty research, and monitor-
ing departmental planning and
review processes. As chairman of
the LSA committee on promotion
and tenure, Gelman spearheaded
the creation of a more transparent
review process.
In a communication to the
regents, Hanlon said he's pleased
Gelman has agreed to serve as
interim dean.
"She is one of the most distin-
guished and highly visible schol-
ars in the College," Hanlon wrote.
"With her years of experience as
a faculty member and her knowl-
edge of the College's administra-
tion gained through her service
as associate dean, I am confident
that the College will maintain its
momentum during this interim
period."
Board to approve new
master's degree program
in Medical School
The regents will review a pro-
posal to add a new Master of
Health Professions Education
degree program, coordinated by
the Medical School. The program
- with participation from the
School of Nursing, the School of
Dentistry, the School of Pharma-
cy and the School of Social Work
- will train students to become
"leaders in education" in various
health professional fields.

In a communication from Han-
lon and James Woolliscroft, dean
of the Medical School, the two
administrators wrote that the
program will target profession-
als to give them "an innovative,
competency-based curriculum"
to enhance their development in
their respective professional set-
tings.
The proposed degree has
been approved by the Medical
School's Executive Committee
and has been reviewed by the
Office of the Provost. With the
approval of both the regents and
the President's Council of the
State Universities of Michigan,
the program will provide a'new
path for future medical educa-
tors.
With more than 2,800 fac-
ulty members in the University's
health professions schools and
other faculty from other Michi-
gan schools, Hanlon and Wool-
liscroft wrote that there's a need
for more formally trained educa-
tors.
The program will begin with
about 12 students per class and
later aims to expand to a stable
matriculation rate of 25 per year.
According to the proposal, the
limited number will ensure each
student is accepted on a selective
basis and receives a focused edu-
cation.
The program requires around
32 to 38 credit hours over a period
of two to four years. The tuition
rate hasn't yet been set.
Regents to consider schematic
design for William Clements
Libraryrenovation
Also pending approval at
Thursday's meeting is the sche-
matic design for infrastructure
improvements and addition for

the William Clements Library.
While the library houses a
wide variety of material, it's
best known for its collection of
original American history docu-
ments.
Built in 1923 by famed Detroit
architect Albert Kahn, the
library will undergo a $16.8-mil-
lion renovation as approved by
the regents at their November
meeting.
The project will include
infrastructure renovations that
will follow historical preserva-
tion techniques. These upgrades
will include improvements in
accessibility, as well as fire
detection and suppression,
heating, plumbing, electrical,
ventilation, air conditioning
and security systems. In addi-
tion to an exterior restoration,
the project plans to construct a
7,500-square-foot addition that
will hold parts of the library's
collection.
In a communication to the
regents, Timothy Slottow, the
University's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
said the project will be funded by
gifts and investment proceeds.
In an interview last month,
Clements Library Director Kevin
Graffagnino said much of the ren-
ovation will entail bringing the
building into the 21st century.
"The architecture of this build-
ing is one of the treasures on cam-
pus; it has to look like this when
it's finished," Graffagnino said.
"After 90 years, we've outgrown
this space, and it's a beautiful old
building, but it needs to be fixed
up."
Pending approval of the sche-
matic designs, the project will
provide 31 on-site construction
jobs and is scheduled for comple-
tion in the summer of 2015.

ized support for the resolution,
dissenters in the room expressed
feelings of hesitation.
"I do not support this reso-

lution; I'm probably one of the
few people who supports the
administration in this matter,"
Finn Larsen, SACUA member
and physics professor, said. "I
think the University is doing
what they can in balancing legal
and practical difficulties with

regards to (diversity). It's a very
complex problem, and to say
diversity is exclusively this is
limiting."
Larsen added that there have
to be "difficult tradeoffs on both
sides" in undertaking major
issues such as campus-wide

diversity.
"By narrowing this view of
diversity, we're simply not tak-
ing a modern view, we're taking
a view that was appropriate 30
years ago, and nowadays it's ille-
gal in the state of Michigan, and
maybe even should be."

ROBOTICS
From Page 1
Given the state's historic back-
ground in manufacturing and engi-
neering, Snyder said he believes
that Michigan has been primed to
become a very important part of this
burgeoningsector oftechnology.
"The building of this technology
and the job opportunities for peo-
ple in these fields is going to be out-
standing," Snyder said. "We have
too many open positions today, and
we need to make sure we fill that
pipeline with great, young people."
In his State of the State address
in January, Snyder spoke about his
desire to get autonomous vehicle
legislationofftheground. Michigan
Sen. Mike Kowall (R-White Lake)
authored Senate Bill 169, which
would allow vehicle manufactur-
ers and suppliers to test self-driving
vehicles on public roads. It passed
unanimously in the transportation
committee and will be on the Sen-
ate floor this week. Kowall said he
hopes that the legislature will have
it ready to be signed by June.
Kowall added that he believes
that automated vehicles could have
an immensely positive economic
effect on the automotive industry,
and he hopes that much of that
growth occurs in Michigan. In
order for that to happen, he said
the state must continue to invest in
education, research and develop-
ment, and likened the autonomous
vehicle innovation to what Henry
Ford did with the assembly line.
"This is opening up a whole new
frontierforwhere transportationis
going to go in the future," Kowall
said. "It's exciting to be on the fore-
front of it."
Since the event's inception
in 2011, attendance at Michigan

Robotics Day has doubled each
year. More than 500 people regis-
tered for this year's event.
Rick Jarman, president and CEO
of the National Center for Manufac-
turing Sciences, said in an interview
that the event was created three
years ago to "energize the entire
ecosystem of robotics in the state"
and provide "anenvironmentwhere
collaboration can occur."
Jarman added that while Michi-
gan has a strong manufacturing
and engineering background, it
will still have to compete on a glob-
al level for commercial opportuni-
ties in automotive vehicles.
"We all have a lot more to do
before they play 'Hail to the Vic-
tors' for us," Jarman said.
Despite all of these possibilities,
Snyder emphasized that success
on these frontiers will depend on
the state's ability to improve and
expand STEM education. One way
of doing so, he said, is to rethink
how these classes are taught. He
advocated for student-centered
learning models that stress more
interactive, hands-on education.
Snyder added that it-was important
to get young children over the stigma
that STEM subjects are too hard.
"We need to help people that
have that barrier understand
that this can be fun," Snyder said.
"Being a nerd can be fun, folks."
Because of the high costs associ-
ated with STEM education, Snyder
said it's important for the govern-
ment to continue to invest in it,
adding that he believes there will
be more private-public partner-
ships that commit to this type of
education in the future.
Many K-12 students involved
in the For Inspiration and Rec-
ognition of Science. and Technol-
ogy program - which designs
programs that motivate young

people to pursue opportunities in
STEM fields - attended the event.
Jarman said he was encour-
aged by the success of the FIRST
program but believes there's more
progress to be made in drawing in
young students to the STEM fields.
"I think there's a whole gen-
eration of technology people that
we're going to need in this space,
not only for creating it, but also for
maintaining it," Jarman said.
Jarman said NASA has also
made efforts in inspiring scientific
curiosity in students.
Engineering junior Jordan
Cassidy, a member of the Robotic
Exploration of Space Team - a part
of the College of Engineering's Stu-
dent Space Systems Fabrications
Laboratory - is taking part in a
NASA-sponsored competition that
requires the team to design and
build a lunar excavator, which uses
autonomous driving systems. Cassi-
dy and the rest of the team present-
ed their project at Monday's event.
"I think that there should be
more (robotics) opportunities in
classrooms," Cassidy said. "Hands-
on skills, practical engineering
abilities, good teamwork, plan-
ning, the design process - all of
that goes into not just robotics, but
anything."
Once there's a greater commit-
ment to these programs in our
education system, Jarman said,
much bigger opportunities will be
on the horizon.
"We're on the precipice of a
revolution that will rival society-
changing innovations such as the
automobile, personal computer and
the Internet," Jarman said. "You'll
be hard pressed to identify any
facet of our daily lives that won'tbe
impacted by this technology. The
technology is out there; all we've
got to do is take the next step."

COUNCIL
From Page 1
believes the proposal is politi-
cally motivated, and he made it
clear that he does not support
the ordinance.
"This was bad legislation
from the day it was proposed,"
Hieftje said. "It's almost like
we're trying to punish the DDA
for creating one of the finest
downtowns in the Midwest."
Charles Coleman, transi-
tional housing coordinator for
Dawn Farm, told council mem-
bers that out of the 150 people
in the Dawn Farm program at
13 sites, roughly 120 were in
the audience to support their
cause on Monday. Many of them
addressed council at the podium
in a public hearing that lasted
hours.
Coleman said he believes
Kunselman and Kailasapathy
harbor misconceptions about
the DDA.
"I think the misconception
that a couple of our council
members have is that the DDA
just deals with parking and
infrastructure," Coleman said.
"They're more than that: (They
handle) affordable housing,
funding for the arts, maintain-
ing streets. They do a lot of won-
derful things."
Coleman added that he
thinks the council delayed the
vote scheduled for Monday due
to the overwhelming disapprov-
al of the ordinance voiced at the
meeting.
"I thought it was kind of a
strategic move that they post-
poned this vote tonight, know-
ing that they would have this
huge turnout," Coleman said.
"'hey couldn't vote with a con-

science tonight knowing they
have this much community sup-
port for this entity. ... I hope (at
the next meeting) they will vote
with their consciences and with
their hearts."
Julie Steiner, executive direc-
tor of the Washtenaw Housing
Alliance, noted that there are
two to three times more home-
less people in Ann Arbor now
than there were over a decade
ago. She said she doesn't under-
stand how affordable hous-
ing will be funded if the DDA's
funding is cut.
"The DDA has been the big-
gest financial supporter of
affordable housing in this town
over the past 20 years," Steiner
said. "The argument is that
you're going to take the money
away from the DDA and put it
back in the city budget ... then
what - in terms of affordable
housing?"
While the DDA doesn't fund
all affordable housing in Ann
Arbor, it does help subsidize
affordable housing projects,
helping them maintain lower
rates than if the funding wasn't
available.
Many advocates from Camp
Take Notice, a program not
funded by the DDA that previ-
ously provided a campsite with
tents to the homeless in Ann
Arbor, came to voice their disap-
proval of the ordinance. While
the program isn't currently
active, Caleb Poirier, founder
of Camp Take Notice, said they
hope to have a campsite in the
city this summer that is near the
Ann Arbor Transit Authority's
bus lines.
Poirier said the homeless are
often not visible to the average
citizen.
"Sometimes during the day-

time, we get cleaned up and
don't want to be recognized as
such, so that's why the home-
less population isn't necessar-
ily visible to the middle class,"
Poirier said. "The middle class
... doesn't realize when they are
zipping by a bridge that people
are livingunder it."
In response to the barrage
of public comments, Kunsel-
man steadfastly defended his
proposed ordinance. His main
argument is that these funds
can be better allocated by the
city and individual entities rath-
er than the DDA, and that the
proposed increase of roughly
$1 million in funds to the DDA
in fiscal year 2015 is completely
unnecessary.
Kunselman added that while
he understands the place the
DDA holds in the city, he ques-
tions whether it's the appropri-
ate vehicle for allocating many
of these funds.
"It's a great reflection of what
we all do believe, and that is that
the DDA is a great institution for
the city of Ann Arbor," Kunsel-
man said. "That being said, the
issues that we are discussing
have to do with future tax dol-
lars that should be directed to
the city and the taxing authori-
ties that also need them."
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) said she believes the
rhetoric has risen to a highly
"uncivil level," and she said
she believes Mayor Hieftje
is off-base in suggesting that
Kunselman's motives for this
legislation are purely political.
Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) said while
the ordinance would not be
the "death nail" to the DDA, he
believes the legislation, as is,
would be harmful.

Ghostface lives on

Angsty rhythm on Thee
Oh Sees latest effort

Former Wu-Tang
member teams up
with Adrian Younge
By JACKSON HOWARD
DailyArts Writer
Ghostface Killah might be
known best as a member of
the Wu-Tang Clan, but take a
quick look at
his Wikipe- -
dia page, and
it's very clear Twelve
that he's much Reasons
more than just
a Wu disciple. to Die
He's released Ghostface
10 studio KiIlah and
albuns
including two Adrian Younge
classics and Soul Temple
an R&B-styled
one - six col-
laboration projects, appeared
in six films, five TV series and
four video games. Simply put,
Ghostface constantly refines
and expands his game, even 20
years after Wu-Tang's classic
debut.
It's not a complete surprise,
then, that Ghostface decided
to cut a concept album with
a live band - led by a mostly
unknown producer - centered
on a mythological black mafia
don in 1960s Italy. The album,
Twelve Reasons to Die, is also
being released with an accom-
panying comic book. Of course
it is.
Ghostface and Adrian Younge
- the Los Angeles-based pro-
ducer behind Twelve Reasons
to Die - somehow manage to
expand Wu-Tang Clan's seem-
ingly unchangeable sound into
an entirely new product. Grant-
ed, Younge's haunting, sweeping
instrumentals take more than a
couple pages from the playbook
of the album's executive produc-
er, narrator and Wu-Tang found-
er RZA, but for the most part,
Twelve Reasons to Die captures
the greatness of Wu-Tang while
also putting an original twist on
its signature style.
The story arch revolves

around Tony Starks - one of
Ghostface's many alter egos
- and his rise, fall and rebirth
battling the fictional DeLuca
mob family in the crime world
of 1960s Italy. The album flows
together naturally from the
introductory overture "Beware
of the Stare," mostly due to
Younge's cinematic instrumen-
tal combination of classic Wu-
Tang style beats, 1960s vintage
soul and jazz. The presence of
Younge and his band, Venice
Dawn, is felt on every track of
the album through extended
outros and mid-song break-
downs during which Ghost-
face seems completely content
to step aside and let the music
play.
Still, Twelve Reasons to Die
is a Ghostface Killah album,
and the authentic feel of the
live band backing him only
makes Ghostface sound better.
His wit, storytelling and feroc-
ity are as strong as they have
ever been, and though it's clear
he's somewhat out of his com-
fort zone with the new style at
times - his trademark charisma
seems lost behind the band on
the first two songs, "Rise of the
Black Suits" and "The Center of
Attraction."
But when he finds his groove,
he's unstoppable. Ghostface
bursts out the gates firing on
the third track, "I Declare
War," an opera-wailing, organ-
laced tale of his conquering the
DeLuca family.
Though surrounded by
ornate production and atten-
tion worthy Wu-Tang member
appearances, Ghostface makes
sure to stick to the storyline of
the album. He falls in love with
the Boss's daughter on "The
Center of Attraction," and then
becomes paranoid about her
allegiance to him on the excel-
lent and grimy "Enemies All
Around Me" featuring the high-
pitched wails of William Hart,
the former lead singer of the
Delfonics.
Tony Starks's suspicions are
confirmed when the Boss's
daughter sells him out on the
seventh track, "An Unexpected

Call (The Set Up)." However,
this is far from the end.
On "The Rise of Ghostface
Killah," maybe the best song
on the album, RZA narrates
how the DeLuca family pressed
Tony's remains into 12 vinyl
records. Tony, then, is able
to come back from the dead
and wreak havoc as .Ghostface
Killah. "Medusa stare, my guns
bust in silence / I'm a black vigi-
lante killer, pro violence / It's
the rebirth, born again / Rise
through the vinyl spin," he raps
confidently over Younge's sim-
ple break-beat and noir-film-
sounding guitar strums.
The rest of the album fin-
ishes up Ghostface's rise and
takeover with "The Catstro-
phe," "Murder Spree" and "The
Sure Shot (Parts 1 and 2)." For
the standout posse-cut "Mur-
der Spree," Ghostface, U-God,
Masta Killa, Inspecta Deck and
Killa Sin all take turns detail-
ing the different ways to die,
from guillotines, cyanide, ice
picks and, as Ghostface threat-
ens over the lingering opera in
the background, "Ghost carved
through your skin tissue till the
bone grizzle."
The very same complexity
that makes Twelve Reasons to
Die work is also the album's
biggest potential flaw. Grant-
ed, most listeners who get the
album are die-hard Ghostface
fans that are prepared to dis-
sect his every rhyme, yet for the
common listener, there's a good
chance Ghostface and Younge's
fantastical and noir-drenched
concept won't be understood
completely.
The album ends with the
instrumental coda title track,
which effectively immortal-
izes the legend of Tony Starks
with looping Wu-Tang piano
and slow violins. He has risen
from the grave to reclaim what
is his, and through the haze
of Younge's swirling and wild
synths, you can almost see
Ghostface fading into the dark-
ness in a cloud of cigar smoke,
the wind howling outside his
window, quietly waiting to
pounce on his next challenger.

Last fall, San Francisco band
Thee Oh Sees bestowed upon us
an unexpected gift in the form of
the EP Putri-
fiers I. As the
name . might
suggest, the EP Floating
was grimy - but .
also delightful. COffm
Each song was Thee Oh Sees
its own distinct
entity - at times Castle Face
fierce and elec-
tric, other times
lethargic and mellow. While Thee
Oh Sees can be praised for its con-
sistent ability to provide quality
California garage-rock, something
about Putrifiers II stood out as
being evolved and'distinct. When,
months later, Thee Oh Sees provid-
ed us with the single "Minotaur" to
preface their newest LP, Floating
Coffin, the song had a more solemn,
aged feeling to it.
Now, as we consider the EP, and
single and all the bread crumbs
alongthe beach Thee Oh Sees have
left us with - well, those weren't
really helpful at all. No, those were
just a distraction from the rotting
corpse inside the Floating Cof-
fin that has slowly been washing
ashore.
Floating Coffin Segins with a
pretty standard Thee Oh Sees
track, "I Come From the Moun-
tain." It's driven with a relentless
and agitated energy, sprinkled
with the band's classic reverber-

fighting against a thick, guitar-

-like much of Thee Oh Sees'swork
- balances grim fury with the soft
and sugary falsetto of John Dwyer
and Brigid Dawson. The title track,
a frantic, pounding songthat seems
to mimic the panic of being buried

Five stages of
'Scary Movie' grief

The weirdest concert
I've ever been to.

Latest franchise
parody butchers
comedy
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily Arts Writer
Movies, like any other form of
art, are made to get a reaction out
of an audience. Sometimes, they
make you cry.
Sometimes, F
they make you
laugh. The best SCary
ones inspire MOVie 5
you. In that
sense, "Scary At Quality 16
Movie 5" (yes, and Rave
therv are five
now) succeeds.
The moment
I walked out of the theater, I was
struck with inspiration - at first,
inspiration to plead with the elder-
ly lady sitting behind the box office
for my seven dollars; slowly after,
inspiration to just give up and cry
about how Hollywood was forever
doomed if people) continued to
watch this film.
All a bit melodramatic, but I
don't care. This is a depressingly
terrible movie and so, this review
will be structured like the five
stages of grief: me losing my shit
and eventually coming to terms
with the fact that the world is not
a nice place.
Denial
The movie starts off on a cheap
note: Lindsay Lohan ("Machete")
in the process of making a sex tape
with Charley Sheen (TV's "Two
and a Half Men"). Come on, guys
- these are the same people whose
faces have been plastered across
the front pages of any worthwhile
tabloid at least once in the past two
years. We get it. They do idiotic
things to get attention. You don't
have to sink to their level. There's
nothing wrong with trying to use
them as a hook to engage view-
ers, but putting them in such an
expectable situation just makes
the whole affair seem boring and
therefore easy.
But movies have started on a
sourer note and gotten better. Fond
memories of the original "Scary
Movie" still flutter around inside
my head. The rest of the film can't
possibly be this dull, right? The fact
that no real plot exists could actu-
ally be a good thing - by relying
on half-assed parodies of narra-

At least someone's excited about this movie ...

tives we're already familiar with,
whoever made this film (Malcolm
D. Lee, "Undercover Brother")
could essentially be sparing us
from whatever he would've come
up with.
Anger
It's too bad the jokes never real-
ly amount to being anything other
than crude, outdated references
to defecation, sex and altogether
awkward subject ~ matter that
seem to have been chosen to elicit
more "WTF"s than laughs. An
example would be a strange spoof
of a "Black Swan" scene involving
a pregnant ballerina giving birth
in the middle of a dance routine
(what the actual fuck?).
There's no point delving into
the insignificant storyline, involv-
ing two beleaguered parents who
adopt the three orphaned demon-
children left behind by Sheen. It's
all just a setup for inane movie ref-
erences starting off at "Parano'r-
mal Activity" and falling as far as
"Inception," obviously the scariest
movie ever made.
What allowed the original to
be relatively successful were the
coherent jibes it took at a relatively
small number of films that were
pertinent at the time. Alluding to
random flicks that don't even fall
within the horror genre just makes
the final product feel scattered. If
the jokes were there to add some
sense of cohesion, it wouldn't have
been as frustrating. But alas, you'd
probably laugh harder at a funeral.
Bargaining
Halfway through the 86-minute
feature, I began to realize this film
wouldn't get any better. But there
had to be something redeeming
it. What about the fact that they
make fun of movies that came out
literally last week? That must mean
the writers (David Zucker and

Pat Proft, "Scary Movie 4") were
on top of their game, coming up
with these hilarious jokes at the
absolute last minute to ensure they
make the movie as topical as possi-
ble. Am I right? No. It's no surprise
the humor feels rushed, jerked
through the production process to
make sure something was on the
page when the actors showed up.
Depression
The saddest part is knowing that
the writers of this movie, well at
least Zucker, has some worthwhile
movies under his belt, namely "Air-
plane!," the first real successful
comedy 'spoof ever released. The
reason that film worked so well is
it had a clearly detached feel from
the subject matter it examined - it
stood on its own and commented
on the things happening around it
and, in doing so, was able to draw
a relatable connection with audi-
ences.
"Scary Movie 5," feeds off its
allusions like a parasite, never
able to find an identity of its own.
It's a sad way to watch a movie
stumble into irrelevance and
push away viewers, but that's
exactly what happens in this
case. It leaves one wondering
how anyone in Hollywood could
possibly have thought tying
together unrelated sections of
"Planet of the Apes" and "Mama"
can ever work.
Acceptance
Sadly, in a sense, it did. "Scary
Movie 5" finished second at box
office this past weekend, raking
in over $15 million, and leaving
me wondering whether angry
articles in the University paper
will ever convince studio heads
that making shitty films isn't fair
to moviegoers. The short answer
is they won't. But, you know
what? Tenacity is underrated.

Whatever I was
expecting from see-
ing Kendrick Lamar
and Steve Aoki on April 12, it
was nothing - nothing- like I
could have
imagined. I
don't think
that's an
unfair claim.
I've been to
enough con-
certs in my .l
life to say, ELLIOT
definitively, ALPERN
that Friday
was one of
the weirdest experiences I've
had at a music performance.
Let me back up. A few weeks
ago, a friend of mine told me that
Kendrick Lamar was coming to
Rochester Hills with Steve Aoki.
We bought tickets for the lawn
seats, and I was particularly
excited to see one of my more
recent favorite artists.
Fast-forward to the concert
on Friday night, which listed a 7
p.m. start time. A three-direction
quagmire of traffic (aided only by
a concert worker - not a police
officer) slowed our arrival, until
we finally arrived around 7:20.
An opener I had never heard of,
one of those "up-and-coming
local rappers," was pumping out
a few random songs as the lawn
packed together.
A pretty normal experience,
so far - at least, until Kendrick
Lamar walked on stage without
announcement or theatrics. The
change from opener to Kendrick
(who I'd assumed would be the
main attraction, with Aoki as
the opener) was so swift and
unrecognizable that a couple girls
behind us complained about his
music, unaware. "When's Ken-
drick getting on?" one asked, as
Kendrick himself rapped into the
microphone.
. The air of confusion persisted
for a few tracks, and the strange
mix of energy from the crowd
seemingly affected my favorite
rapper, to the point of being.
unexcited. "Put your hands up!"
Kendrick would exclaim a few
times before songs - but between
dropped words and shortened
verses, he seemed both peeved
and apathetic about his opening
set. After 40 minutes, he walked

The Flaming Lips provoke

Four years have passed since the

of "Heads Will

music from the group.
Hoping for a change in sound,
the group snatched up producers
such as TV on the Radio's Dave
Sitek and LCD Soundstystem's
James Murphy on it's latest effort,
Mosquito. The result is a scattered
album with tracks containing
everything from a gospel choir to
hints of reggae and a sample taken
from the subway (like the train,
not the fast food sandwich place -
though maybe the band could file
that idea away for the next album).
Despite all of the obvious efforts
to cultivate a new style, the group
comes up short of reaching its goal,
as Mosquito still clearly resembles
a Yeah Yeah Yeahs album (albeit a
lackluster one). Certain tracks such
as "Slave" and "Despair" serve as
unintentional filler tracks with

In order to break the record,
'Team 36' will have to go unbeaten

Already, Michigan coach Carol

"I think we can be one of those

end by Purdue.
The Achilles' heal for Indiana
this season has been poor pitch-
ing. Hoosier pitchers carry a team
earned-run average of 3.45, while
the offense has been held to just
over three runs per game. And
against a Michigan offense that
makes quick work out of aces, the
matchup could be a promising one.
The Wolverines have thrived
in the early innings this season,
and, of late, have seen very little
of the sixth and seventh innings.
Through the first 12 contests of
the Big Ten season, Michigan won
via mercy rule in seven games.
Against Michigan State, the
offense scored a total of 32 runs to
complete two run-rule victories. It
marked the fourth straight mercy-
rule win for Michigan and the
16th this season.
"Our rentire game plan the
whole time is hit the low pitch and
lay off the high," said senior sec-
ond baseman Ashley Lane.
Freshman Sierra Romero -

who won her fourth straight Big
Ten Freshman of the Week award
- represents just one power bat
the Hoosier pitching staff will
face on Tuesday. Behind the slug-
ger, Hutchins has gone to several
bench players, namely freshman
first baseman Kelsey Susalla and
senior co-captain outfielder Jac-
lyn Crummey. With Crummey
hitting .475 in limited at-bats and
Susalla contributing with 13 RBI,
it is easyto see why.
"(Romero's home runs) ignited
us. If nothing else, she ignites us.
The kids have had so much con-
fidence in her all year," Hutchins
said.
With two outs in the bottom of
the third inning Friday, Susalla -
who has earned more playingtime
of late - hit her second home run
in as many gaines. Her shot was
the first of back-to-back pinch-hit
home runs from utility players. A
deep bench means pitchers can no
longer afford to walk Romero.
"If one thing isn't working for

us, we pick it up in another area,"
Lane said. "If one person can't do
it, we know another another per-
son can."
Michigan has been doing just as
much damage without swinging
the bat this season.
"The one thing I like about this
team is that nothing fazes them,"
Hutchins said. "They don't seem
to worry about things they can't
control, and that's what I like
about them."
Patience has been a virtue in
two-out situations, especially
when Romero is at the plate. In an
April 6 game against Ohio State,
the Wolverineswalked eighttimes
en route to an eight-run inning.
After the Spartans intentionally
walked the bases loaded with two
outs, Romero hit her second home
run of the weekend.
"I don't think I've seen any-
thing like this (team)," Hutchins
said. "I've seen some explosions
from my teams, but I can't even
remember."

Wolverines jell too late to keep streak alive

It takes some perspective to
understand why a 16-12 regu-
lar season is particularly disap-
pointing. After all, a winning
record is a winning record, and
given the brutal competition the
Michigan water polo team faces,
being over

like an FACHER
achievement

Believe it
or not, though, the 2013 season
will likely go down in the record
books as the worst year of Michi-
gan water polo. Ever.
Since the program's establish-
ment in 2001- the firstyear the
NCAA sponsored a champion-
ship in women's water polo -
the Wolverines have never won
fewer than 20 games in a given
season. And if you give them a
pass for the program's inaugural
year, that number jumps to 22.
In those 12 seasons, the pro-
gram has won the CWPA West-
ern Division 11 times, the CWPA
Eastern Division Tournament
five times and made five NCAA
tournament appearances.
But this year, Michigan won 16
games in the regular season and
failed to win the CWPA Western
Division for the first time since
2001. Back then, Michigan coach
Matt Anderson was an assistant
at Indiana, working for the man
who is currently his chief adver-
sary, Barry King, who's in his
16th season at the helm for the
Hoosiers.
Anderson had plenty of tal-
ent to work with this season.
Senior attacker Kiki Golden, for
instance, has consistently domi-
nated this year and currently sits
at seventh on the list of all-time
Michigan goal scorers.
Senior goalkeeper Alex Adam-
son also has her eye on the Mich-
igan record books. She has a shot
- depending on how far the Wol-
verines advance in the postsea-
son - to move into second on the
all-time saves list. That would
place her, interestingly enough,
behind former Olympian and
current Michigan assistant
coach Betsey Armstrong,

Junior driver Audrey Pratt has set career highs this season in points, goals and steals. She's also one of just seven Wolverines to play in all 35 games this season.

from years past?
In short, the Wolverines typi-
cally lose many, but not all, of
their early-season games against
the elite teams, usually West
Coast powerhouses California,
Hawaii and Arizona.
This year, though, Michigan
lost all of those games. Every
single one.
In January's Michigan Kick-
Off Event, held in Ann Arbor, the
Wolverines fell in consecutive
games to No. 3 UCLA, No. 9 San
Jose State and No. 7 San Diego
State.
One week later, Michigan
traveled to the San Francisco
Bay Area, only to fall to No. 1
Stanford in a blowout, No, 9 San
Jose State (again) and No. 4 Cali-
fornia. It didn't end there, either,
The Wolverines lost twice to No.
10 Long Beach State in the next
two weeks, followed by defeats

at the hands of No. -8 Hawaii in
March and No. 3 Arizona State
in April.
Even against No.20 Hartwick,
a league opponent that Michi-
gan beats fairly consistently, the
Wolverines fell, 10-6, on April 6.
Michigan's marquee win this
season remains a 10-9 over-
time, victory against then-No.
12 Indiana in Bloomington on
March 30. It was a hugely impor-
tant victory, no doubt, and in an
intense rivalry game to boot, But
that was the Wolverines' only
marquee win, an obvious warn-
ing sign for Michigan.
In comparison, the 2012 Wol-
verines pulled off upsets against
No. 6 Hawaii, beat No. 14 UC
Davis, took care of business mul-
tiple times against Hartwick and.
hung tight in the season's third
game against No, 3 UCLA.
The year before, Michigan

was even more impressive, at one
point winning eight consecutive
games in Southern California,
six of which came against top 20
West Coast schools.
This year, the Wolverines
relied on their freshman class
more than ever. And the fresh-
men seemed simply too young
and inexperienced in the early
going to be capable of pulling off
a Hawaii or UCLA-type upset.
Understandably, it takes time
for a group of rookies to accli-
mate to college competition and
everything that goes along with
it. Michigan's lack of success in
the early season seems as attrib-
utable to scheduling as anything
else -- you don't see many other
college teams sporting a fresh-
men-heavy roster start their sea-
son with seven straight games
against top 10 competition.
The class did grow into its role,

but it took time. Two freshmen,
driver Presley Pender and two-
meter Bryce Beckwith, ended
up finishing second and third in
scoring for the Wolverines with
33 and 32 goals, respectively.
Freshman driver Ali Thomason
was a valuable contributor as
well, recording 13 goals and 14
assists.
The freshmen seemed par-
ticularly comfortable during a
10-game winning streak in late
March, despite the fact that the
streak came against Michigan's
weakest opponents - a list of
schools that includes Mercy-
hurst and Grove City. That run
gave Michigan a respectable
win-loss record but likely did
little else to improve the team's
stock going into the postseason,
Golden carried the Wolverines
all year. She represented far and
away Michigan's biggest offen-

TODDtNEEDLE/Daily
sive threat, and her 51 goals and
28 assists might have made the
difference between a winning
and losing record in the regular
season. But even Golden couldn't
push the Wolverines over the
edge in close early-season con-
tests ok in recent CWPA Western
Division matchups against Hart-
wick and Indiana.
The year is salvageable, with-
out a doubt. A deep run into the
CWPA Eisterns would probably
do the trick. Actually winning
the event - Michigan's only path
to an NCAA Tournament berth
- would make the 2013 regular
season all but forgotten.
But such a run would be quite
the surprise for a team that has
yet to demonstrate its ability
to compete with the truly elite
teams in women's water polo.
With this team, though, it's
toughto tell.
