Curriculum unveiled
for winter 2015
builds on former
certificate program
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
DailyStaffReporter
As extracurricular opportuni-
ties to grow business and encour-
age student entrepreneurship
continue to expand, so do in-class
offerings.
Starting with the Winter 2015
semester, the University will
offer an entrepreneurship minor
through LSA.
"Our students are known for
their interestin applyingtheir tal-
ents and creativity in response to
a need or problem," said Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel in
a statement. "This program will
provide students with knowledge
they can use to further ignite their

imaginations and pursue creative
solutions to real world challeng-
es."
The minor falls under the
umbrella of innovate Blue, a
University program launched in
March that works with Universi-
ty, local and commercial partners
to spur entrepreneurial spirit in
the classroom and outside it.
The 15-credit minor is broken
down into four focus areas: core,
practicum, electives and self-
directed extracurricular experi-
ence. Innovate Blue will serve as a
center for declaring the minor and
advising. Two hundred students
are expected to declare when the
minor launches next year.
The core will consist of two
courses that were piloted this fall,
titled Entrepreneurial Business
Basics and Entrepreneurial Cre-
ativity. The former is run through
the Ross School of Business and a
lecturer in the Department of Psy-
chology teaches the latter.

member of the all-girls a cap-
pella group TheSirens.
Did you know that you were
going to do a cappella when
you came to Michigan?
I really love to sing and I
didn't know if I wanted to pur-
sue a major in it but Iknew that
I wanted to continue it and I
thought that (a cappella) would
be a great way to do that.
I knew I wanted to do it
but I didn't know exactly how
to pursue it. I just saw a flyer
and I went for it. It was really
stressful. It was similar to
sorority rush in terms of how

it was fun because all s the
groups areveryeasygoingand
made it comfortable.
What's your favorite thing
about being in The Sirens?
I love having that group of
friends because we do a thing
called #SirenSighting, where
if you see any of the girls in
the group, you take a picture
with them and you post it in
our group chat. I love having
that core group of friends that
you can always see and talk to.
Is it hard to balance a cap-
pellawith schoolwork?

didn't like it, but I love it
so much. For example, on a
typical week we have two
rehearsals that last four
hours.
But for a concert week, we
have maybe four rehearsals
and one lasts like six hours.
It's a lot, but you have so
much fun and you're singing
what you like. It's all direct-
ed by people in the group so
you don't feel like it's a has-
sle. It's really enjoyable.
Have you gotten any lead
singing roles?
It was "Ain't No Sun-

because I didn't even know
the song going into the
solo. We do auditions for
songs during our rehears-
als. I hadn't heard that
song and I thought it was a
cool and soulful song so I
tried it.
I fuddled through it and
I guess they saw something
that they liked, so I got the
part. It was really exciting.
The thing is, one person is
never the lead singer for
the entire group. Typical-
ly, for a concert set we do
12 songs. I think everyone
but two people had a solo.

You're putting your own
time into the performances
and songs. We don't have any
adult supervising us; it's just
all of us.
We can all work together
and produce awesome songs
because what pebple might
not realize about a cappella
is that the people in our
group arrange the songs we
sing.
They're already songs
that are out there, but we
have to put together the
chords and all of the dif-
ferent parts. It's really
awesome to- see the final

of students with apparent mental
disorders like depression have not
received any mental health services
within the past year."
Robert Winfield, the University's
chief health officer and director of
UHS, said the competitive nature of:
the University means students can
suffer from stress even whenevery--
day lives are going well. He noted,"
that students face stress from their"
roles on campus as well as from the
pressures of the world they must
inhabit oncethey leave Ann Arbor.
"It's a competitive campus and
it's also a competitive world," Win-
field said. "The pressures are not
just immediate,butenormous as we
lookout."
He said some of the University's
responses to stress on campus -
while intended to ease student
stress - send mixed signals.
For instance, after receiving feed-
back from students, the University
authorized 24-hour operations at
the Shapiro Undergraduate Library
in October 2012. Winfield said this
message escalated the competive-
ness among students by suggest-
ing that their peers are swtudying

"There are all of these subtle
messages that come out,"hesaid.
LSA junior Emma Shapiro and
Zaccardo said they know students
who have stayed at the UGLi until
5 a.m. Zaccardo said she knows pre-
ined students, in particular, who
stay well into the early hours of the
morning.
LSA junior Natalie Imirzian said
she has occasionally taken advan-
tage of the UGLi's late operating
hours, both by herself and with
friends.
"I've utilized it somewhat, more
so now,near the end ofthe semester,
as I panic and try to get everything
done," she said. "I've been (at the
UGLi) until three or four before."

Student group
hosts discussion on
planetary research,
settlement
By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT
Daily StaffReporter
Gabriel Rothblatt, a Florida
politician, gave a presentation
Wednesday night in the Bob and
Betty Beyster building that dis-
cussed widening space explora-
tion opportunities for average
Americans. The talk, given to a
handful of students, was hosted
by Students for the Exploration
and Development of Space.
Rothblatt's main talking
points included the privatiza-
tion of the space industry, com-
monly known as NewSpace,
and galvanizing public inter-
est in the space industry from
a more human perspective. In
last month's midterm elections,
he ran as a Democrat in Flori-
da's 8th Congressional District,
which includes Cape Canaveral:
and the Kennedy Space Center,
and lost to Bill Posey (R). His'
primary campaign platform was
space exploration.
Rothblatt argued that the
problem with the space indus-
try is not one of funding, but of
incentive. One of his primary
points was the idea of settlement
as the main goal of space explo-
ration.
"As long as we focus on cheap,"
it'll never be cheap enough," he
said. "If we put everything on
the Mayflower and took it back

and forth, it would never have
been profitable to colonize the
Americas. It was only profit-
able to buy a ticket and come
here once we established cities.
Let's make settlement the goal,
and then cheap access becomes
a necessity."
Most of the mass and expense
of a satellite comes from what it
takes to send it into orbit itself,
Rothblatt said, proposing the
use of space as alocationofman-
ufacturing and production.
"The true solution to cheap
access to space is to put in space
what you need to make the
things up there," he said. "If
most of the things we wanted
to achieve were built in space, it
would be greatly cheaper."
Engineering senior Derek
Napierala, president of Students
for the Exploration and Devel-
opment of Space, said his group
invited Rothblatt because of his
interest in expanding the idea of
space exploration.
"I thought that his passion
for space as well as his desire
to make change not in just the
engineering field but also the
political field to the populace is
commendable," Napierala said.
Rothblatt's presentation also
touched on space exploration as
a common endeavor instead of a
science-specific project.
"Too often people think if
you're interested in space you
have to be an aeronautics per-
son," he said. "NASA needs
engineers, Boeing needs engi-
neers, but Mars needs farmers."
Engineering sophomore
Logan Sisca said the issue con-
straining development in space

is more about bringing the gen-
eral public into the fold.
"It's more about really
democratizing space and how
we can get more involved with
this pursuit rather than just
billiort-dollar government con-
tracts," Sisca said.
Rothblatt commented on
his own identity - he is Black,
Jewish, comes from an LGBTQ
family, and his father is Martine
Rothblatt, founder of GeoStar
and Sirius Radio - as a catalyst
for his interest in space.
"I'm always on the outside,
havingto adapt tothe groupthat
I'm with," he said. "And I found
that really interesting about
humans: we try to adapt it to us,
rather than us adapting to the
environment."
Sisca said college students
need to become more aware of
their potential in regardto space
development.
"I think right now students
don't know that they have that
opportunity; it's a very select
number of people who are pas-
sionate about it," he said. "By
improving our outreach and
making more students aware of
this, then they'll get on board
and it'll keep reading."
Rothblatt said the future
of space exploration should
not resemble the Space Race,
but instead a common, human
endeavor.
"I believe space is a message
of unification. I believe space is
something that creates human
nationalization," he said. "Space
is the thing that makes us forget
about our differences and focus
on a common goal.

H,- ,,O


tions aretreatable.
"Stigma is a major issue and it
exacerbates all the other reluctance
to acknowledge that we're less than
perfect,"he said.
- "This is where cancer was 50 or'
60years ago," he added. "You didn't
talk about it, you didn't mention that
your relative had it, and you sort of

hushed itup."
Eisenberg said such stigma sur-
rounding treatment can be broken
down into two categories: perceived
public stigma and personal stigma.
In his research, he has observed
much higher levels of perceived
public stigma.
"We see thatthe personallevel of

stigma is quite low; they have posi-
tive attitudes (toward treatment),"
he said. "There is a discrepancy
between what people think every-
one else is thinking versus what
people are actually thinking based
ontheir ownreports."

forms. One form, ParaGard, is hor-
mone-free and made of copper. The
second, Mirena, releases a small
amount of a progestin hormone.
The final method, Skyla, which was
introduced in 2013 and is marketed
primarily to young women who
have not had a child, releases small
amounts of the same hormone.
Eighty-seven percent of under-
graduates used some form of con-
traception during their most recent
instance of vaginal intercourse,
according to the National College
Health Assessment administered
by UHS. Among those students, a
majority said they used male con-
doms or oral contraceptives.
The survey found condoms and
pills most popular among students,
both of which are generally effec-
tive in preventing pregnancy. Nine
percent of women taking the pill
will have an unintended pregnancy,
compared to 18 percent of couples
using male condoms, according to
UHS.
Laura McAndrews, UHS sexual
health educator, said research and
experience have demonstrated that
students get a significant portion
of their information about birth
control and sex from their friends,
causingthe perpetuation of stereo-
types of what are perceived as pop-
ular or safer birth control methods.
"It has alot to do with the kind of
education they have had access to,
as well as the information theyhave
gotten from their friends," McAn-
drews said. "If your friends are
using condoms and pills, those are
goingtobethemethodsyoualready

as we start to see more people using
IUDs and implants, more people
that will be talking about them
and becoming more familiar with
them."
While statistics show a high
majority of women who properly
use contraceptive methods such as
condoms and pills will not become
pregnant, IUDs and implants prac-
tically ensure that an unintended
pregnancy will not occur. Failure
rates of IUDs and implants are less
than 1 percent, but they are being
isediby 6 percent of'ndergradu-
ates and 0.5 percent of graduates.

about IUDs and implants to feel

is that I have to experience that
stress and anxiety almost everyday,
or all 15 weeks of the semester, and
thatissimplynottrue."
Sevig said stress and anxiety are
the most frequently documented
reasons that students come in to
CAPS, a trend that started about
five or six years ago.

Beyond the perceived stigma,
Eisenberg added that a lack of
urgency might also be contribut-
ing to the small number of students
who seek help.
"It's got us thinking about the
parallels between seeking help for
mental health and things like diet
and exercise, or other health behav-
iors where peopleseemtohave fairly
good knowledge and fairly positive
attitudes about the behavior, and
yet a large percentage of cases don't
actually adopt the healthy behavior
... I think that there are some really
subtle interventions that can really
changebehaviorsintermsofmental
health."
Dalack, the professor of psychia-
try, said mental illness should be
looked at like any other physical ail-
ment, such as the flu or a high fever.
"There's a part in the middle of
the flu where you can't remember
what it felt like to feelgood,"he said.
"And you feel like, I'm never going
to feel well again.' When you think
about that and depression, that can
be pretty terrifying, especially if it's
affecting your psychological state."
Looking for help
Dalack recognizes that "the sup-
port network is key, whether that's
friends, family, professors, teach-
ers, or counselors, because we all
tend to not recognize issues when
it's us versus in somebody else. Our
own insight can be undermined by
our own wish to not identify with
being sick. Partly it's education, and

drewssaid."Another issue has been
that students do not want a foreign
object in their bodies or are con-
cerned about the cost and issues
related to insurance coverage."
In September, the American
Academy of Pediatrics announced
a change in its recommendations,
stating it now advises that doctors
recommend intrauterine devices
over other methods of contracep-
tion for teenagers who are or plan
to become sexually active.
"For the first time, the organi-
zation recommends that pediatri-
cians discuss long-acting reversible
contraceptives before other birth
control methods for teens, citing
the 'efficacy, safety and ease of use'
of long-acting reversible contracep-
tion, such as IUDs and progestin
implants," the report says.
Though the cost is substantial,
generally about $600 for a student
without insurance, the device is
effective at preventing pregnancy
for as long as 10 years and requires
only one application. McAndrews
said she has found price to be a con-
cern for some students, but not nec-
essarily justforthose students who
do not have insurance.
"Most insurance plans will cover
IUD or implant costs, but if a stu-
dent is on their parents'health plan,
they may be nervous about using
their insurance for contraceptives,"
she said. "We encourage studentsto
speak with a medical professional
abouthowtohavethatconversation
with their parents, because most
parents would much rather their
child have thebest methods ofbirth
control, even if it means having an
uncomfortable conversation.'
In a survey conducted by The
Michigan Daily, 13 percent of stu-
dents received information about
birth control from friends, com-
pared to 3 percent who received it
from campus resources and 54 per-
cent from a medical professional.
LSA senior Sophia Kotov, former
president of Students for Choice,
said she has heard concerns from
many students who are hesitant to
obtain birth control from UHS.
"The (UHS) doctor was super
useful and helped me figure out
what type of birth control worked
best for me," Kotov said. "I think
UHS has a reputation for being
unhelpful and ineffective, and I
think that deters a lot of students
from getting their birth control
questions answered there. UHS
needs to change their image as well
as the quality of their care. Honest-
ly, the pamphlets in UHS look like
they are from the '90s, I don't know

how relevant they are to women's
lives now"
Kotov said many of her friends,
who are also involved in the
Department of Women's Studies
or Students for Choice, are fairly
well informed, but she believes
the majority of students still don't
fully understand how birth control
works, where to get it and what
methods are best suited to their
needs.
"I think trying to remember
information from sex education or
going through the process of sched-
uling an appointment with UHS
and remembering what your doc-
tor says combined with the avail-
ability of so much information on
the Internet makes it difficult, and
people definitely go to their friends
with issues or questions alot of the
time," Kotovsaid.
She said her friends were sur-
prised to hear she used an IUD
because of the stigma they associ-
ated with the device - namely that
it is onlyused by older women who
have already had children.
"I have had so many friends who
react stronglyto findingoutIhave an
IUD, so I definitely see that stigma
playing out in mylife,"Kotovsaid.
The Daily survey found that
when studentsare choosing a meth-
od of birth control, effectiveness is
by far the most important factor,
followed onlybysafetyand the pos-
sibility of harmful side effects.
For the 5 percent of students
who said cost is the most important
factor when choosing birth con-
trol, condoms seem to be the most
obvious choice, as they are free for
students. For students who pre-
fer another brand over LifeStyles,
the most common brand available
at UHS, UHS has started to offer
Magnum Trojan condoms begin-
ning this year. Trojan condoms
purchased through downtown mer-
chants such as drug stores generally
cost about $7 for a pack of three.
Oral contraceptives, however,
can become costly over time. For
a student with insurance, this cost
may be minimal or nonexistent
depending on providers and plans,
but for students who do not have
insurance, and, for example, pick
up their birth control at CVS down-
town, the cost per month could be
around $20, according to UHS.
There are options - though seem-
ingly more inconvenient ones - for
minimizing these costsby picking{
up prescriptions at locations far-
ther from downtown, where the
cost for an uninsured studentcould
be as little as $8 per month.

INNOVATION
From Page 1A

The new curricular offering
comes as a result of recommenda-
tions from a campus-wide entre-
preneurship taskforce established
in May 2012 to survey campus
offerings in the field for under-
graduates.
Thomas Zurbuchen, senior
counselor for entrepreneurship
innovation and Innovate Blue's
head, said in a release that the
new minor is meant to address the
challenges ofthe modern world.
"We believe all students have
the capacity to be innovators," he
said. "This campus-wide minor
provides them with the knowl-
edge,skillsand motivation to build
the skills attributed to entrepre-
neurial behavior and innovative
thinking necessary to succeed."
Jeni Olney, student services
program coordinator for entrepre-
neurial programs, said Entrepre-
neurial Business Basics outlines
the fundamentals of business for
aspiring entrepreneurs, whereas
Entrepreneurial Creativity is
"more of an intrinsic look at what
makes entrepreneurs and creative
thinkersdifferent."
"The two courses combined

make up the foundation, the core
for the new minor," Olney said.
"I refer to it as the hard and soft
skills of being an entrepreneur."
The minor's "practicum"is also
made up of two courses, titled
Entrepreneurship Practicum
and Advanced Entrepreneurship
Practicum. Olney said these will
be taken in tandem to provide a
hands-on, yearlong immersion
into entrepreneurship, moving
from conceptualizing and pitch-
ing a business venture to imple-
menting and launching it.
Additionally, a minimum of
three elective credits is required
to finish the minor. A complete list
of qualifying courses is available
on the Innovate Blue website.
The website also states that
entrepreneurial extracurricu-
lar activities are required for
a minimum of two semesters.
This "activity" may include, for
example, working on an outside
business venture or participating
in an entrepreneurship-focused
student organization.
Olney added some of these
course options were already
available through the Center for
Entrepreneurship's Program in
Entrepreneurship, which pro-
vides a certificate in entrepre-
neurship as opposed to a full

minor.
The certificate program
requires nine credits rather than
15, comprising the two "core"
classes and one elective.
The Innovate Blue website
notes, however, that the PIE
will be phased out and "is only
available to those students who
declared the PIE prior to Fall
term 2015."
Kristen Kerecman, marketing
and communications manager
for Innovate Blue, said the goal
of implementing the minor was
to make entrepreneurship educa-
tion more accessible to non-Engi-
neering students. Many electives
previously offered through the
PIE were focused on engineering.
"What came from this campus
program in entrepreneurship ...
there was really a need for some-
thing, and a demand from 'stu-
dents to really have something
that was truly campus-wide and
accessible to people from allback-
grounds,"Kerecman said. "LSA is
the natural home for something
like that."
Olney said the end goal is to
create multidisciplinary teams in
each of the University's colleges,
so each college can "have own-
ership over the curriculum that
goes into the minor."


ARCADE
From Page 1A
things like Donkey Kong and Ms.
Pac-Man, things I grew up with,
are still here," Vogel said. "So it
can take the older people back to
the younger days when we were
first introduced to those types of
games."
The 10,000 square-foot estab-
lishment began when eight-year-
old East Lansing native Ted
Arnold and his two brothers set
up a pinball machine in a garage
in 1973, The Michigan Daily
reported in 2012. However, run-
ning the business in a residen-
tial area was illegal, so once city
inspectors discovered the opera-
tion, the brothers closed the
garage shop and opened in Mon-
roe, and then in East Lansing.
Opening in a former dough-
nut bakery, the arcade had a
life-sized fiberglass elephant on
the roof- which the brothers-
painted pink to attract attention.
The business has used the pink-
elephant as its mascot since. The
Arnolds soon expanded to Ann
Arbor during the 1980s, eventu-
ally opening seven arcades in
total, including the Pinball Pete's
just off the Diag.
However, during the mid-
1980s, people began buying the
first home console gaming sys-
tems instead of going to arcades,
and arcades began to disappear
from U.S. suburbs and cities.
Ann Arbor's arcade history is an
example of this decline: the six
other arcades in the Ann Arbor
and East Lansing areahave since
closed, leaving Pinball Pete's
alone, according to Petterson.
"It just got to be too much,"
he said. "There's only so many
hours in a day, and there's not a
whole lot of people that can fix
these machines and most of them
aren't around anymore."

However, as the only arcade
in the area, Pinball Pete's has
attracted regulars from Detroit
and even afew from pinball clubs
in Ohio, accordingto Petterson.
"The older people will always
come to the arcade. It's the
younger people we're worried
about. But that's why we have the
mix of stuff."
Vogel's daughter, LSA fresh-
man Kate Vogel, said she contin-
ues to bea Pinball Pete's regular,
following in her mother's foot-
steps.
"When I was in middle school
it was a good place for people to
come and hang out," Kate Vogel
said. "We would go to Bubble
(Island) in the summer and
then come here and just play for
hours. We would play air hockey
for a long time and then a rowing
game. It was really fun and weird
and just kind of a thing to do."
Though the recession and gen-
eral decline ofthe industryheve--
been hardfor thercade, Petter-
son remains optimistic.
Evan Williams, a comput-
er science student at Eastern
Michigan University and a pre-
vious employee of Pinball Pete's,
agreed.
"I think it will make a come-
back," he said. "Pinball Pete's
just got the new Walking Dead
(pinball) machine and aMustang
machine last summer. The new
tables are honestly my favorite."
However, if popularity
increases again it will come with
a variety of new problems, espe-
cially for the old machines like
Donkey Kong and Pac-Man.
Petterson said production of the
parts used in these old machines
stopped long ago. This problem
is especially apparent with the
classiccathode ray tube moni-
tors of older machines, which are
being replaced with LCD moni-
tors by producers.
"LCDs in the classic stuff

doesn't look right," Petterson
said. "Donkey Kong on a flat
screen has blurrier lines because
it upscales for the resolution, and
it doesn't look right. I spend a lot
of time dialing in monitors to try
and keep them looking nice. It's
a huge investment to fix up old
games."
Petterson also pointed to high
real estate costs in Ann Arbor
and the electricity bills associ-
ated with running an arcade as
challenges in maintaining the
more than 30-year-old business.
As difficult as survival has
been for the arcade, Lisa Vogel
is happy Pinball Pete's has sur-
vived for future generations to
enjoy.
"I think it's a great place for
people to gather. It's not a place
for people to come and party and
get drunk; it's just something
that's nice and wholesome and
clean fun," she said. "Pinball
Pete's was a popular hangout for
people to come and play pool and
pinball. Back then it was 25 cents
for a game of pinball, and now
it's more like a dollar."
"It's been here for so long,
my parents used to come here.
It's been a huge part of every-
one's life, so I'd say it's been a
huge part of Ann Arbor. I think
it's definitely a part of the
downtown culture. It's a safe
place for people to get together
and just have fun." Kate Vogel
agreed.
Pinball Pete's is home to both
classic pinball and arcade games,
as well as pool and air hockey for
the newer regulars, creating a
safe atmosphere where Univer-
sity students can escape their
studies for an hour or two with
friends.
When asked if the establish-
ment would last, Petterson had
this to say:
"We're still here, and we're
not going anywhere."


partly it's overcoming the stigma ...
I view it both as an individual thing
as well as importance of the friend
network."
He said efforts have been made
to educate RAs in dorms as well as
facultyandGSIs,whomaybesable to
intervene if they see someone who
is at risk.
Eisenberg and the Healthy
Minds Network have started a
student-leader coalition that meets
every two weeks and joins leaders
of a variety of student organiza-
tions. Some of these groups - such
as PULSE, Active Minds and Own
It - havea specific focus on health
and well-being,while others suchas
Central Student Government have
established branches focusing on
such issues. There is hope that the
coalition will play a large role in dis-
seminating information about men-
tal health to large portions of the
University.
In addition, Eisenberg said he and
his teamhope to create new courses
in which students will help with the
production of the brief videos that
the Healthy Minds Network pro-
duces. Such courses would focus on
a variety of disciplines, from film
production to psychology to social
marketing and dissemination. If the
program receives funding, these
courses could be offered at the Uni-
versity as early as Winter 2016.
Wolverine Wellness, a division
of UHS with the goal of promoting
overall wellness on campus, piloted
wellness coachinglast January. Stu-
dents can see a wellness coach who
is able to provide tools and strate-
gies to those concerned about high
stress levels. Similar programs are
also in place at Ohio State University
and West Virginia University.
Within UHS, there is a proac-
tive focus that allows students to set
individualized goals for themselves.
Coaching begins with a 90-minute
session, and participants can set up
regular appointments in order to fol-
lowup withgoals and track progress.
Wolverine Wellness Director
Mary Jo Desprez explained the
importance of the wellness model
and all of its different dimensions in
relation to wellness coaching. The
wellness model encompasses many
different aspects of life, including

intellectual, physical, financial,
emotional, mental, environmental,
occupational, social and spiritual
health.
"We help the student take a long,
deep breath and look at how they
are doing in each of the different
dimensions, and understand how
they sort of are interdependent on
each other," she said. "Really what
they can do, in wellness coaching,
is self-assess and focus in on one or
multiple areas and they can make
goals for them."
"The University ... is to really
start to understand that students
are whole people, they're not just
thebraininthe classroom,"Desprez
said. "When you ask students what
their definition of success is, they
say'my GPA' and 'if I get a job.' Our
collective job is to say it's much
more holistic than that."
To expand the University's role
in promoting mental health, Eisen-
berg said he hopes to integrate the
mental health checkup process
with academic advising. Such an
effort would demonstrate the link
between health and academic suc-
cess, he said.
"We want to normalize it and
make it part of a routine,"he said.
CAPS provides traditional one-
on-one counseling, but also engages
students in a variety of other ways.
For example, in 2011, CAPS opened
the Wellness Zone, which allows
students to simply walk in and
use the available facilities, which
include massage chairs, meditation
cushions, yoga mats, a couch for
napping,alamp for seasonal depres-
sion and even agamingsystem.
Additionally, CAPS offers differ-
ent workshops, among other types
of support, in order to reach out to
more students.
Regarding CAPS services, Imir-
zian said, "I know people that have
(used CAPS). I've heard mixed
things. I've heard it's hard to get
access or get appointments... it's like
you have an issue right now, so you
want something immediately, but
I've alsoheardgreatthingsaboutit."
While Shapiro said she does not
know much about CAPS, she said
she would definitely be interested
in learning more about it if it could
help her with her stress levels.


TESTIMONY
From Page 1A
Singh told the committee this
was a turning point for the state,
which would join 19 others in
having similar policies to the
amendment he proposed.
"(This is) a historic day to ...
tell the rest of the country who
we are, what we stand for and
what our values are," he said.
He also told the commit-
tee that excluding transgender
people would be the same as
condoning discrimination, a
message echoed by several of the
other speakers.
Gilmour, who was one of a few
openly gay executives during his
time at Ford, said businesses are
concerned that the current lack
of protections for LGBTQ indi-
viduals disincentivizes people
from coming to work in Michi-
gan.
"Concepts don't develop
themselves, cars don't sell them-
selves ... and no organization can
afford to leave out a segment of
the population," Gilmour said.
"Now is the time to stop leav-
ing out the LGBT community.
We need the talent," he added.
All of the speakers in favor of
modifying the ELCRA except for
Foster supported Singh's more
inclusive amendment.

In speaking for his bill,
Foster acknowledged the con-
troversy surrounding it. He has
faced criticism from both sides
of the aisle, and his support for
the proposed amendment was a
major point of contention dur-
ing the Republican primary
election for his seat in August,
which he lost.
"Some people think the bill
goes too far," he said. "Others
think it doesn't go far enough.
I say it's the next positive step."
Opponents of the bill -
speaking for several several
conservative religious groups,
including the National Chris-
tian Leadership Council, rep-
resentatives of the Michigan
Christian Coalition and the
Michigan Family Forum -
questioned the bill's neces-
sity and impact. They also
expressed concerns about
potential consequences for reli-
gious freedom in the state.
Keith Den Hollander, a
representative of the Michi-
gan Christian Coalition, told
the committee his opposition
stemmed from concerns with
the efficacy of the bills rather
than morality.
"I don't accept the premise
that by changing the law, we
will change people's hearts," he
said.
Lansing attorney David

Kallman, who represented the
Michigan branch of Citizens
for Traditional Values and the
Michigan Family Forum at the
meeting, said similar laws in
other states have had negative
impacts on religious freedom,
especially for small businesses.
"Bakeries, photographers, on
and on - there is case after case
where this law is being used as
a sword; it's not being used as
a shield," he said. "These laws
are being used to bully and
silence individuals acting on
their religious conscience."
No additional Commerce
Committee meeting regarding
the amendments is currently
scheduled, but the House Judi-
ciary Committee is expected
to debate a third bill closely
tied to the Elliott-Larsen Civil
Rights Act, the proposed Mich-
igan Religious Freedom Resto-
ration Act, on Thursday.
The Michigan RFRA, pro-
posed by House Speaker Jase
Bolger (R-Marshall) paral-
lels existing federal legisla-
tion and would grant broad
exemptions to state laws if they
conflict with an individual's
religious beliefs. Bolger has
said he would require its pas-
sage before allowing an ELCRA
amendment to come to the
House floor, a position Demo-
crats have decried.

White people love me

Accessibility in snow

As a dusting of crystalline
flakes morphs into anoth-
er potential polar vortex,
students will likely experience a
myriad of emo-
tions. My initial
wonderment, for
example, often
dissipates into
a slight annoy-
ance and eventu-
ally transforms
into a panicky
concern to main-
tain my balance AH USA
while dashing SCHOLKE
across campus.
The University's
student body will soon be reintro-
duced to ever-too-familiar winter
perils as they walk to class. Lay-
ers of ice will glaze sidewalks as
we trudge through snow piles, and
bitter winds will strike faces await-
ing the arrival of delayed buses.
Rather than endure the seasonal
hazards, some students will choose
encampment in the warm safety
of dorms. For others, indoor con-
finement might seem like the only
viable option.
While winter poses safety
risks to the student community,
seasonal hazards illustrate an
issue on campus. Wintertime
proves a hindrance for able-bodied
students, but for students with
mobility impairments, the external
conditions greatly diminish
accessibility and aggravate existing
issues. Able-bodied students and
faculty - as they go through their
routines - unintentionally overlook
challenges students with physical
disabilities encounter daily. We
often move effortlessly through
our personal spheres and never
consider the tremendous capability
of our limbs to do so. Rather, we
automatically acceptthis particular
physical status as "normal."
After a few minutes, a bus -
which able-bodied individuals
enter with ease - will come whisk
them out of the cold. Students can
strategically plan a walking route
to minimize exposure to frigid

temperatures by seeking out the
nearest entrances, utilizing stair-
wells and elevators and traversing
across corridors. -If students still
feel frozen, they can warm up with
food from a dining hall. In certain
areas of campus, these options
aren't necessarily available to stu-
dents with mobility impairments.
Hindrances to mobility may be a
seasonal affliction for able-bodied
students, but for students with
physical disabilities, they're life-
long concerns.
Numerous buildings currently
pose challenges to students.
According to Public Policy senior
Ryan Bartholomew, chair of
the Campus Accessibility and
Disability Affairs Commission, "a
lot of the buildings, even if they are
accessible, sometimes are hard for
people to access." The commission
works to address complaints and
concerns about mobility on campus.
Even recently updated dormitories,
such as East Quad Residence Hall,
pose problems to a segment of the
student body. The handicapped-
accessible door at East Quad is
located far away from the building's
main entrance, and the door is
locked throughout the day, which
prevents students from entering
the building for class or for a meal
unless they live there.
Although I previously lived on
North Campus, I was surprised
to learn of the multiple difficul-
ties mobility-impaired students
encounter there. Parents and hun-
gry students are supposed to be
reassured by the promise of con-
venient, healthy meals at the Uni-
versity's various dining halls. Yet,
Bursley Residence Hall lacks an
elevator or any means that would
allow its dining hall to be accessible
to students with physical disabili-
ties. Likewise, the Duderstadt Cen-
ter doesn't possess a "continuous
elevator" to the facility's third floor,
which hinders students who need
to access resources at the Dude or
to simply meet with a study group.
However, the most striking
example of inefficiency is located at

the Bob & Betty Beyster Building.
Although the BBB possesses a fully
functional elevator, it currently
doesn't operate after 8 p.m. - ford-
ing mobility-impaired students fin-
ishing a late evening of studying to
walk outside to a parking lot at the
top of the hill to await Paratransit's
arrival. During a video shoot to
raise awareness about inaccessibil-
ity, I accompanied a student as he
ascended the steep slope. The side-
walk nearly encircles the building
- as well as a surrounding cluster
of trees - and the route is signifi-
cantly longer than the distance one
would take up the stairwell within
the BBB. This extended exposure to
the elements has drastic effects. As
Bartholomew noted, "People with
mobility impairments are not mov-
ing their body as much as someone
who is able-bodied ... so when they
get cold, they typically stay cold for
a long period of time."
Working in cooperation with
University Housing and other Uni-
versity departments, the Campus
Affairs and Disability Commis-
sion implemented measures such
as snow removal procedures and
protocols for removing bikes from
ramps. The University has respond-
ed to requests and complaints in
the past, but many issues persist.
The University's resources for stu-
dents with mobility impairments
areeither non-existent, difficult to
find, inefficient or unnecessarily
distant. Mobility status is a social
identity that far too often escapes
consideration in our minds. Form-
ing a diverse community requires
acknowledging the need for a wide
variety of resources for all students
in order to aid them in achieving
an education and personal growth.
While the University must ensure
resources for all students are consis-
tently accessible and accommodat-
ing, we, as students, should work to
raise personal awareness and reform
our perceptions of a truly diverse
student body.

VAMIKA BAJA I
Econ
Have you ever thought about how
your education might be shaping the
way you see your life? I had never
acknowledged that my studying of
economics might be influencing,
and perhaps even limiting the way
I think ... until Nov. 14.
Itwas acloudySaturdaymorning.
I was tired, it was freezing cold, and
I was bikingto the UGLi. I only had
five minutes to make it to my Econ
meeting. That's when I realized, in
just a few weeks it would be too cold
to bike and I would have to walk
everywhere. What a bloody waste
of time ...
But that thought required me
to pause and think. What exactly
makes something a waste of time?
To me, walking or sitting in a car
is a waste of time, but writing my
paper is not. Watching the snow fall
is a waste of time, but making it to
lecture half-awake is not.
Just like in economics where a
country's GDP is defined in terms
of its output of goods and services,
I have begun to define my life in
terms of value added. A successful

omics of happiness

day is a productive day. Where
there is no tangible output, I've
wasted my time.
But I ask the economists, what
about the cumulative happiness of
the people? Is that not a measure
of a country's success? And I ask
myself, what about those great
conversations I've had in those
long car rides or people I've met
waiting in line. Are those moments
not worthwhile?
Where economists go wrong is
that they attempt to quantitatively
model that which cannot even be
measured. The entire subject lies
on the outrageous assumption that
human beings are rational. But
what kind of assumption is that?
We do the right things at the wrong
time, we say the wrongthings to the
right people. We make war, we fall
in love. We are crazy, impulsive and
irrational creatures, yet that's what
makes us human.
And where we go wrong (or at
least I do) is when we attempt to
quantitatively define ourselves. As
students, ahuge amount of our daily

lives revolves around academics.
And once you're an upperclassman,
that pressure is only exacerbated
by the stress associated with
recruitment. Suddenly our grades,
our GPA or the job we've lined up
begin to define who we are.
We can't deny that as students,
our lives are disproportionally
influenced by academic pressure.
There are days when we are happy
and excited. There are days when
we are simply overwhelmed and
distressed. Regardless of our
mental, physical or emotional
state, what is expected of us does
not change. Sometimes we need to
step out of that stress bubble and
remind ourselves of what it is we
truly value.
Don't get me wrong; I'm still
just as passionate of an economics
student. But sometimes, we all need
to turn off autopilot and see where
we're actually flying. So next time I
ask you about yourself, don't tell me
what you study, tell me who you are.
Vamika Baja is an LSAjunior.

My friend Maya and I lock our bikes
simultaneously on State Street, stationed at
a pole in front of Espresso Royale. Out of the
corner of my eye, I notice a man standing and
facing us a few feet away. After pushing mylock
closed, I look up and make eye contact with
him. It seems he was waiting for the prompt to
profess: "White people love you."
I perceive this middle-aged white man say
it to me like it's scripture. Half of me is sure
of the sentiment, the other half suspended in
disbelief; maybe I've heard him wrong.
"White people love me?" I ask, and as
soon as the words are out of my mouth, my
uncertainty dissipates.
"White people love you," he repeats, looking
me inthe eyes urgently. I feel my insides deflate
as I take in his words. He walks away before I
can shape a response, and Maya and I go into
Espresso. She whispers, "That was so strange."
If Maya hadn't been present, I probably
would have shared this event with a spare few.
I would have brushed it off while being aware
I was brushing it off. I still took it lightly; it
was a declaration about something of which I
was already aware. White people, particularly
white men, do love Asian women, for the
simple fact that we are Asian women. No great
revelations made.
However, this interaction solidified
knowledge: Not only do fetishization,
sexualization, tokenization of Asian women
exist, but this man (onfirmed they're also as
prevalent as I suspected. That he formulated
this thought and felt it strongly enough
to share it with me reveals how this is an
established sentiment.

His declaration makes me feel like
a walking, talking opportunity for
men, particularly white men (because
unfortunately, the man on State Street spoke
accurately), to ogle at, to freely superimpose
images of sexualized East Asian women.
It made me realize that this is why I avoid
sexuality. This is why I try not to attract men
by the way I dress, the way I behave. This is
why I question every romantic relationship
I've had, wondering if they're seeing past the
surface of my race.
As a generation, we are realizing there
are subconscious choices we make, tugging
us in certain directions, guided by media
and historical discriminations. However,
I feel very little power to combat them.
The majority of the people I have dated
are straight white men. They are who is
available, but also whom I deem attractive. I
despise knowing that some, if not all, of this
attraction is derived from constant images
of white men as the leading protagonists in a
majority of romantic narratives.
I seethe, knowing how much I have
tailored my behaviors to this consciousness.
How much I attempt to dissuade sexualized,
racialized attention. How much this defines
my interactions. This symptom stays with
me, measuringthe sincerity of every act in an
exhausting stream of analysis.

The official finals
week style guide

By JACLYN NAGEL
Weekend Roundup Contributor
It's the University's
biannual fashion week. Check
out our very own runway to
find the best fashion week
trends. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I
say fashion week? I meant
finals week. FYI, the runway
is located on the second floor
of the UGLI.
ROOTS SWEATPANTS
If you're from Michigan
(or Canada), you probably
own at least three pairs
of these beauties. They're
comfortable, stylish, and
moderately overpriced. Make
sure to pick yours up in light
gray, medium gray, or dark
gray. Don't forget to pair it
with your favorite gray Roots
sweatshirt to create the
perfect groutfit.
FUZZY VEST
As the weather drops
below freezing, a fuzzy
vest is a go-to. The library's
temperature can certainly
vary and this vest will keep
you cozy without making
you pass out (or might make
a decent pillow when you hit
the ground).
UGG SLIPPERS
While the traditional Ugg
boot has gone out of style,
Ugg slippers are still on my
holiday gift list. These will
not only keep you warm on
your walk to the library, but
will also keep you comfy

throughout your all-nighter.
WOOL SOCKS
The votes are in. You finally
have a use for the 12 pairs of
SmartWool socks you bought
during your seventh grade ski
obsession. You can even pair
them with your Ugg slippers!
Talk about a fashion "do."
UGLY SWEATERS
Get into the holiday spirit
by showing off your favorite
ugly sweater! Whether it's
covered in sequins, reindeer
or snowflakes, you will
definitely stand out against
the sea of Canada Goose
jackets. With this look you
can go straight from a study
session to a party without
even stopping at home!
INFINITY SCARF
Also referred to as the
"circle scarf," this is a winter
finals staple. It's soft, stylish,
and protects your face from
the cold that is Michigan
weather. It can also serve as
a great pillow for when you
need a study break.
THE PONYTAIL
While the bun is usually
the star during spring finals,
the ponytail takes over for
winter finals week. Ponies
work great with both hats and
earmuffs (I suggest Ugg's)
and keep the hair out of your
face when studying, while
buns leave your ears to fight
for themselves against the
cold.

understood the importance of
coaching the Wolverines.
Hoke followed by saying
"shame on them" to people who
believed Michigan was in a
downward spiral.
It was what Michigan fans
needed to hear. But then Hoke
led the Wolverines to a string of
results he knew would be unac-
ceptable from the get-go, when
he gave himself lofty annual
expectations.
"Our goal is to win the Big
Ten Championship," he said
that January afternoon. "Multi-
pally, consecutively. I made that
word up, the first one."
And he stood by that expecta-
tion, even calling the 2011 sea-
son a disappointment because
the Wolverines failed to reach
the Big Ten title game. When
the expectation was set at "con-
secutive" titles, Hoke knew

either.
He understood that such poor
performances would turn his
"forever" job into atemporary
one.
Hoke loves Michigan. He
did from that first day, when
he spoke of how he "would've
walked here from San Diego"
to accept the job. Maybe that
was part of the problem - he set
expectations too high and deliv-
ered too little.
Michigan thought it needed
Hoke, and the marriage seemed
perfect from the start. Cer-
tainly, the response to his firing
from players demonstrates how
Hoke's love for the program and
everyone associated with it was
genuine.
But when it comes to ath-
letics, passion for a school is
always trumped by the necessity
to win.
Hoke knew that from the
start.

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
One aspect of a football
program that changes drastically
with a coaching change is the
recruiting scene. And this trend
isn't new to Michigan, which
announced the firing of Brady
Hoke on Tuesday afternoon.
The lack of on-field success
this season has led to coaching
instability that had recruits
fleeing for months.
Recent de-commits include
Chris Clark, the top-ranked tight
end in the nation, and five-star in-
state running back Mike Weber.
Clark announced he had
reopened his recruitment
shortly after Jim Hackett's press
conference Tuesday. The senior
from Avon, Connecticut, hasn't
been shy to share his opinions on

"Due to the unfortunate
change in coaching at Michigan
and the unknown of who will
take over the program, I am no
longer committed to Michigan,"
Clark announced via Twitter.
"I still am very interested in the
program."
He took an official visit to
Southern California, and has
planned visits to Texas, North
Carolina and South Carolina by
the end of January.
Weber's decommitment added
to the avalanche of attrition, and
came at a comically fitting time.
He announced via Twitter just as
Maryland took a fourth-quarter
lead against the Wolverines on
Nov. 22. Weber also said he will
announce his new commitment
at the Army All-American Bowl
on Jan. 4.

University professors
explain changing
tastes in pop music
By GREGORY HICKS
DailyArts Writer
Picture this: you're shopping
through a supermarket; pushing a cart
down the right side of the aisle, taking
note of all the most popular brands,
and when you see something that tick-
les your fancy, you toss it in your cart.
Oftentimes, however, there's one
more step thrown in for those who
take pride in their self-awareness:
flipping the item around and scan-
ning through the ingredients and
nutrition facts.
140 calories, 8 grams of protein,
some red dye No. 40 thrown in there.

Check. Toss it in the cart.
Now imagine if we treated our
music this way.
A clap on the second and fourth
beat, a few doo-wop backing vocals,
some brass in A major, female
empowerment lyrics thrown in.
Check. Toss "All About That Bass"
into your iTunes library.
Professors at the University are
here to act as your musical nutrition-
ists. With the year coming to a close,
it's time to consider what exactly
you've digested with radio and popu-
lar music characteristics in 2014. If
asked, could you pinpoint the year's
biggest trend? You might be surprised
how much your listening habits have
changed in the past few years.
Pop goes the weasel
American Culture Prof. Bruce Con-

forth sits at the desk of his Haven Hall
office. There's a guitar case resting on
the floor next to him, just below alarge
portrait of Robert Johnson - all cast
in the orange glow of a lamp-lit room.
Not coincidentally, Conforth is on the
executive board of the Robert Johnson
Blues Foundation and is a performing
blues musician himself.
But most importantly, Conforth
is an expert when it comes to popu-
lar music. As the first curator of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the highly
regarded American culture expert has
worked with 'everyone from Ringo
Starr to Aretha Franklin, and here he
is now, delivering his expertise on Tay-
lor Swift -The magazine's 2014's most
buzzed-about artist - without even
being prompted.
"Time Magazine just had Taylor
Swift on the cover of their recent issue,
and the caption on the cover was 'The

Power of Taylor Swift,' soI had to read
the article. At the verybeginning ofthe
article they called her 'America's most
important musician.' That's a direct
quote from Time magazine. Taylor
Swift is America's most important
musician."
Conforth isn't afan of Swift, howev-
er, nor does he believe that the country-
gone-pop singer is representative of
any sort of long-lasting artistic legacy.
What he does believe is that Taylor
Swift is the pinnacle of 2014's biggest
commercial trend: hyper-produced,
hyper-honest anthem pop.
"You've got these two tensions
going on in pop music," Conforth said.
"You've got this tendency towards
the homogenization and blandness of
auto-tuned perfection and every song
sounding exactly the same, and then
you've got this other contingent of
people who are saying, 'Well, we want

something that sounds a little more
honest, and maybe we need to go in a
completely different direction!"
And upuntil this year, Conforth said
the two crowds were going in com-
pletely different directions.
"The groups like Mumford & Sons,
the Lumineers, Hurray for the Riff
Raff, the Avett Brothers - what I call
these acoustic pop groups - who the
rap on them is that people were turn-
ing to thembecause they wanted some-
thing more honest," Conforth said.
"They were sick of the overproduced
pop single, and they wanted something
that sounded more honest, more real,
more authentic."
That desire for honesty bled into
today's dance pop, even if not as
poetically as the acoustic pop groups
of 2012.

You know it's coming.

widen in anxious anticipation for
the four most complicated words
in the English language that'll
soon be thrust in your direction:
"What's your favorite song?"
Every song you've ever heard
starts to go through your head
and you get dizzy and time keeps
passing. But you still haven't said
anything. Your heart begins to
race even faster than before. All

Son who asked the question - that
cruel interrogator - and realize
that an immediate reply is neces-
sary because you're dancing on
the brink of social ineptitude and a
nervous disorder.
So you blurt out your go-to song:
some old Beatles tune you heard
when you were five or some sappy
acoustic number that touched you
at one point in your life. The typi-
cal answer. But is that really, out
of all the brilliant music weaving
through the world, the song that
powers through for you? What is it

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Literary Columnist
The end of the fall semes-
ter always brings a wide array
of emotions. There's relief that
classes are over. There's excite-
ment for the upcoming year. But
for those of us who are graduat-
ing in May, there's a very differ-
ent emotion to contend with: fear.
For seniors, this time of year is
rife with indecision and anxiety
about our plans for after gradu-
ation, specifically on whether
our degrees will be enough to
find a job to help pay back loans
from getting our degrees. Ah, the
American higher education sys-
tem.
If someone else is paying your
tuition (and you aren't concerned
about student loans), you have
my permission to stop reading
this article and go back to riding
your pony around your ancestral
estate in the Hamptons, which I
can only assume is what you do.
But back to the desperate
undergrad. After racking your
brain trying to figure out a sure-
fire plan for gaining financial
stability, you've undoubtedly
come to the only logical conclu-
sion: pay off your student loans
by penning a series of highly
successful historical romance
novels.
"But wait," you protest, "I
don't know anything about his-
torical romance novels." Well,
you're in luck, because in this
particular genre there's a well-
established formula for success.
You're going to want to set
your story in Regency-era Eng-
land. Why, you ask?
Because it's a thinly veiled
attempt to borrow some literary
credibility by trying to vaguely
associate your work with Jane
Austen. But if anyone asks, it's
because you like the dresses.
Your heroine will be indepen-
dent and witty, but 'alsb refined
and demure. As such, she is
either a wallflower or a spinster.
Her family is in dire financial
straits and she's the only one
competent enough to dealwith it.
While she's made peace with her
quiet life on the fringes of ball-
rooms, she yearns for adventure
and, dare we say, romance.

You should make sure to
repeatedly mention her plain
looks, but then offer descriptions
that make it clear she doesn't
actually deviate from traditional
standards of beauty at all.
Your hero is a rogue, a rake,
a scoundrel, etc. Some incident
from his childhood, perhaps
mentioned in the prologue, has
left the hero jaded and aloof.
He's far taller than what would
have been statistically normal
for the time, but it's symbolic
of how he holds himself above
people. Deep, right? It almost
goes without saying that he is
god-like in his handsomeness.
In addition, he's most likely the
richest man in England. And
he's a Duke. In other words,
he's kind of a big deal. How-
ever, someone may be plotting
against him in order to steal
his title and fortune. You don't
have to pay too much attention
to that part though, as it will
only be mentioned sporadical-
ly. Love takes precedence over
intrigue in these works.
Your hero and heroine will
meet in a decidedly awkward
manner. It will probably have
something to do with the hero-
ine needing financial help. Once
the hero learns that he cannot
easily intimidate or charm the
heroine, he will be fascinated,.
and of course, completely smit-
ten. The heroine will find him
vexing, but will acknowledge
that he is indeed gorgeous and
makes her feel odd things. The
hero, always up for a challenge,
will engineer several "acciden-
tal" run-ins with the heroine,
slowly building up the tension.
Then comes the moment that
all the little moments have been
building up to: your hero and
heroine hook up with the white
hot intensity of a thousand
suns. This will most likely be
an unplanned tryst i a library
during a large elegant party.
(Who knew that when you
sneak off to the Stacks with your
significant other, you're actually
participating in a rich literary
tradition. Just please wait until
I've returned my book.)
But the hero and heroine are
not so conscientious, and are
caught by either the heroine's

guardian or the biggest gossip in
town.
Because your hero is first and
foremost a gentleman, he will
offer to marry your heroine so
she will not be socially ruined.
While both of them will express
misgivings, secretly both of
them will actually be totally
stoked at the turn of events.
And so they'll get married, by a
special license, of course.
As time goes on, both hero
and heroine will realize that
they actually deeply care about
each other, but neither will
admit anything to the other
because humans are intolerably
dumb.
The denouement is when that
pesky plot, which hasn't been
mentioned in some ten chap-
ters, is finally resolved. Usually
it runs down something like
this: villain kidnaps heroine,
hero saves heroine, they admit
their feelings for each other
and your eyes roll so far back
into your head you can see your
brain. I understand the narra-
tive need for a dramatic real-
ization that they both love each
other, but can we not mix it up
a little? Would it be so heinous
for the heroine to save the hero?
And not through some wussy
cop-out "she saves him through
love" junk.
Anyway, your couple is now
free to live happily ever after,
secure in their social rank and
status. Though in all honesty,
there's probably a pretty good
chance your hero is syphilitic.
But don't mention that, since
it's kind of a mood-killer.
And finally, you'll need a
title. Luckily, this too can be
distilled down to a simple for-
mula: "How to (insert a syn-
onym for seduce) a (insert a title
of English nobility)." And with
that, you're done.
Now you're fully prepared
to start your Regency romance
empire. When you've raked in
your millions, spare a thought,
or some of your millions, to this
humble columnist.
Prosniewski is working
on her first bodice-ripper.

Yannick Ilunga's haunting,
gentle, James Blake-esque
falsetto. Singer, producer,
multi-instrumentalist, this
exceedingly talented South
African artist lets his voice
and lyrics carry his listeners
through the fading mist of the
song. As if he means to repre-
sent the dueling personalities
of the struggling couple the
song describes, Ilunga allows
his voice to vacillate from a
high falsetto to a low alto.
Breathy yet strong, his vocals
are undoubtedly the stron-
gest instrument the song pos-
sesses.
By the three-minute mark,
multiple marriages of sound
emerge. An additional electric

guitar and drum set meet amid
electronic mist to add inten-
sity and sonic depth. Ilunga's
alto carries the lyrics while his
falsetto beautifully whispers
more on the song's intent. A

selves. While they go to inves-
tigate, the girls continue to
bond over their past relation-
ships; Jody calls out Donna's
ex-husband for fat shaming
and general douchery. Donna
goes out for some air and dis-
covers that one of the sheriffs
in town is actually a vam-
pire. Unfortunately, though,
this scene is marred by some
shoddy camera work - we've
grown accustomed to the dra-
matic zoom that "Supernatu-
ral" is so fond of using, but the
shaky camera style used here
was particularly jarring.
Naturally, Donna is startled
by her crash course into the
supernatural world, but once
all four characters are on the
same page, they check out a
lead together. When they find

the sheriff they're pursuing,
they're ambushed by a gang
of vampires who are planning
on convincing the Sheriff to
come back to their gang of free
love and bloodletting. When
he refuses, the other vam-
pires kill him before Dean and
Donna break free and take
them down.
While Jody helps Donna
come to terms with her partic-
ipation in a beheading, Dean
admits that for the first time
since he came back he didn't
feel like the Mark of Cain was
pushing him during a kill. But
this might simply be the calm
before the storm, with immi-
nent drama of the mid-season
finale looming ahead next

"(Country and hip hop) music
are linked to underprivileged
social groups in America," Hubbs
said. "We expect them to bring
us a kind of realness for our
consumption that shows us the
shadier side of life in a way that
we can handle and ina way that is
interesting to us."
Perhaps the "fancy" side of
life wasn't what the hip-hop
community was looking for this
year.
Unpolished music as
polished authenticity
"There's a backwash of people
who are thirsty for how the music
would sound if the artists weren't
recording in the studio. You get a
CD that's been re-mastered and
they have four bonus tracks ...
where they didn't have this chord
worked out or this vocal worked
out and people are fascinated by
that and they'll buy that. People
want to hear artists working
on perfection rather than the
perfection itself," said Carlos
Rodriguez, associate professor of
music education.
One of the University's leading
authorities on popular music
and music education, Rodriguez
narrates an unorthodox trend
he has seen in today's tweaked-
to-perfection pop music. In fact,
whether he realizes it or not, he
has just described a significant
feature of Taylor Swift's new
record.
It always seems to come back
to that.
Swift released three bonus
tracks of voice memos dictating
certain thoughts and processes
she was going through while
writing tracks with Jack Antonoff,
Max Martin and Ryan Tedder.
Swift isn't the first to do so, but
the voice memos are certainly
a representation of authenticity
and the dispelled illusion of
immaculate perfection.

"I heard an interview with Jack
White," Rodriguez recalled. "He
doesn't think of his songs as 'his
songs.' He says he just looks at the
world and looks what's around
him and does what he does and
then lets it go. He says he's just
herewhen ithappens,buthedidn't
create this. It's just everythingthat
goes on around him."'
Get drunk on a plane. Shake off
the haters. Marry her anyway. If
they're not about that bass, move
along.
That's the biggest trend of 2014.
It's this brutally honest music in

'New Girl's Schmidt
delightfully douchey

Max Greenfield's
character is the
type we love to hate
By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK
Daily Arts Writer
Of all the jerks on TV, there are
few that I love to hate more than
Schmidt on FOX's "New Girl."
Though he's the loft's biggest
contributor to the Douchebag
Jar - a refaced tip jar that's
filled whenever someone says an
offensive comment - Schmidthas
become an icon with his pitch-
perfect one liners and ridiculous
tenacity for life. As he says, "I
always like to give 110 percent."
Played by Max Greenfield
("Veronica Mars"), Schmidt is
a formerly overweight, socially-
awkward Jewish kid who has
blossomed into a smooth-
talking ladies' man with a taste
for the good life, whether that
be a nice jar of mango chutney
("or really any chutney") or
an immaculate manscaping
groom. Schmidt isn't shy
about pointing out any flaws
his roommates Jess (Zooey
Deschanel, "Elf"), Nick (Jake
Johnson, "21 Jump Street"),
Winston (Lamorne, Morris,
"Sex Ed") and Coach (Damon
Wayans, "Happy Endings")
might have. In season one, he
describes Nick as "delicate.
Like a flower. Like a chubby,
damaged flower who hates
himself."
Don't be fooled by his suave
demeanor, though, because
Schmidt gets the blues like the

has figured out how to bring
indie flair to the well-forgotten
era of American Bandstand.
The video's elegance lies in
its simplicity. Vocalist Zooey
Deschanel (also known for her
depiction of Jess Day on "New
Girl") dances with a ghost in a
transience that makes you beg
for her to find whomever she's
longing for,. The choreography
is exemplary of the emotions
that accompany loneliness and
disappointment, and what starts
off looking like Deschanel in
simple child's play turns into a
rock-ribbed routine of twists and

tape, she finally established Consequently, they have also

formed a beautiful partnership
with each other - the essence
of why the club has become so
successful from its foundation.
"It's a really nice opportu-
nity to meet people who are
passionate about global issues
... They're some of the coolest
people I know," Zandee said.
"We spend a lot of time
together," Murray said. "It
takes a lot of coordination, a lot
of meetings, a lot of planning
and the small people trying to
start a club at this big Univer-
sity has been the best bonding
opportunity."
As they invest so much time
into the ambitious undertak-
ing, they only become more
passionate about sustainability
issues and the eradication of
world hunger themselves. As
they educate others, they con-
sequently delve in further to
the cause themselves.
"One of the big aspects that
FeelGood emphasizes is that
it's helping people end their
own hunger," Murray said.
"So it's not about giving peo-
ple food handouts, or giving
them money. It's about raising
(awareness), doing different
education things and sustain-
ability practices - just trying to
empower the communities."
Because FeelGood gener-
ally focuses on the logistics of
the sandwich making and the
delivery, they stress the extra
effort to remind themselves of
the bigger picture beyond the
day-to-day.
"People should care about
the work we do because it's
bigger than (feeding hungry
people)," Zandee said. "When
people are hungry, they can't
really reach their full human
creative potential ... If everyone
had enough to eat to maintain a
healthy, active lifestyle - they
would have such beautiful voic-
es to offer to the world."
"There are so many people in
the world with so much to offer,
but they can't focus on doing
anything but feeding themselves
on a day-to-day basis," Murray
said. "If we can help take that
strain away, we can see what
some of these people can do who
may not have been able to show
this potential otherwise."
In essence, they want every-
one to be involved in this grand-
er partnership.
We eventually parted ways
for the night - them off to their
meeting, and me off to start my
Chaucer essay. As I finish up
my paper, I'll have another site
open next to my procrastination
tabs for FeelGood's last deliv-
ery of the semester. I'll surely
get my own "Vegetable Victor"
- hopefully to satisfy my late-
night study munchies and my
small contribution to ending
world hunger.
