Thousands flock 
to Kerrytown for 
annual celebration

Ann 
Arbor 
Pride’s 
25th 
anniversary was celebrated in 
Kerrytown with performances, 
vendors 
and 
kid-friendly 
activities over the weekend.
There 
was 
yoga, 
belly 
dancing, a street fair, poetry 
slam and a performance by AJA 
from “RuPaul’s Drag Race” 
throughout the day Saturday. 
On 
Sunday, 
JuJubee, 
also 
from “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” 
hosted Pride Bingo Brunch at 
Blue Llama Jazz Club and a 
Pride Picnic that took place in 
Wheeler Park. 
Among the attendees were 
members and supporters of 
the LGBTQ+ community, from 
people who have just started 
their identity journey to people 
who have been fighting for equal 
rights for years. Joe Schoch, 
co-director of Ann Arbor Pride, 
reaffirmed how the festival 
achieved that goal this year by 
planning a plethora of age and 
gender-inclusive activities and 
performances. 

“It’s really important for us to 
be sure that Pride is inclusive for 
everybody,” Schoch said. “Ours 
is 
very 
community-centric, 
and we try to do a little bit of 
everything for everybody.”
The 
proceeds 
from 
the 
festival will benefit the Jim 
Toy Community Center, an 
LGBTQ+ resource center in 
the Washtenaw County area. 
Cadence Cartier, drag queen 
performer 
with 
Boylesque, 
noted the importance of Jim 
Toy’s work.
“The 
services 
that 
they 
provide really do help our 
youth, really help give them 
the support that they need 
when they don’t have support,” 
Cartier said. 
In addition to the performers, 
booths 
selling 
merchandise, 
promoting political campaigns 
and giving away items were 
set up close to the main stage. 
One of the booths was run by 
an organization called Free 
Mom Hugs, a non-profit group 
of affirming allies and parents 
aimed 
to 
spread 
love 
and 
acceptance. 
Arleta 
Greer, 
co-lead 
of 
the 
organization’s 
Michigan 
chapter, described the hardships 
faced by many LGBTQ+ youth.
“So many of our younger 
generation 
in 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
community is struggling with 

being accepted at home, or being 
accepted at school,” Greer said. 
“Sometimes, this is the only 
parental hug they’ve gotten in 
days or weeks.”
Alongside Free Mom Hugs, 
there 
were 
also 
numerous 
support 
and 
mental 
health 
organizations. A 2015 report by 
GLSEN on the National School 
Climate Survey found that 85 
percent of LGBTQ+ students 
have 
experienced 
verbal 
harassment and 27 percent have 
been physically harassed due to 
their sexual orientation. 
Rackham student Lindsey 
Beaver said she recently began 
identifying as bisexual, and 
shared her experience with 
discovering herself. 
“(Your identity) is a huge 
part of your daily experience, 
your interactions with other 
people,” Beaver said. “I found 
that when I started realizing 
that I wasn’t straight, it was like 
this whole thing wasn’t locked 
inside me where all of a sudden 
I could love people more. All 
of a sudden, I feel a lot more 
comfortable.”
Drawing 
from 
her 
own 
experience, Beaver emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
Pride 
festivals and celebrating gender 
identity. 

Principal files 
lawsuit against 
school district

Shannon Blick alleges 
‘reverse discrimination’ 
at AAPS’ Lawton
Elementary School

Shannon Blick, former principal 
of Ann Arbor Public School District’s 
Lawton Elementary School, is alleging 
the district ousted her in an act of 
“reverse discrimination,”according to 
her lawsuit against the school.
On May 1, Dawn Linden, Ann Arbor 
Public Schools executive director of 
Elementary Education, sent out a letter 
to the parents of students at Lawton 
Elementary School, reporting that Blick 
was on a temporary leave of absence. 
With no formal reason provided or a 
specified time length, Dottie Davis, 
former Huron High School athletic 
director 
and 
assistant 
principal, 
assumed the role as “guest principal.”
Two months later, Blick, with aid from 
Ann Arbor attorney William Tishkoff, 
filed a $5 million lawsuit against Ann 
Arbor Public Schools. Superintendent 
Jeanice Swift, in line with other 
administrators and the AAPS School 
Board, attributed her termination to 
“reverse discrimination.” In addition to 
financial compensation, Blick is asking 
to be reinstated as principal of Lawton 
Elementary.
Blick claims the AAPS board and 
their 
key 
administrators 
“subject 
white administrators to hostility and 
harassment in the workplace based on 
their race; accelerate the promotion 
and advancement of African American 
and minority administrators at the 
expense and to the detriment of 
white administrators and refuse to 
‘reasonably and properly investigate’ 
and take remedial action for, ‘reverse 
discrimination’ workplace complaints,” 
per her lawsuit.
Tishkoff declined to interview on 
record, but pointed The Daily to online 
reports for further information.

Local attorney 
examines biases 
in criminal justice 
system, legal rulings

On Monday night, a crowd of 20 
people, mostly women, gathered 
in the Ypsilanti District Library 
to partake in a panel put on by 
Mothering Justice, a non-profit 
organization that advocates for 
women to become active in policy-
making. The panel discussed how 
Black women are viewed in the 
legal system.
The focal point of the evening 
was the caricature of “Sapphire,” 
a character made famous on the 
“Amos n’ Andy” show. According 
to Ferris State University, the 
character Sapphire was a berating 
housewife who saw her husband as 
a failure and regularly scolded him 
for his flaws. 

Attorney Erane Washington, 
who practiced law for 26 years and 
opened her own law firm in 2005, 
said the Sapphire narrative has 
not only negatively impacted her 
clients’ lives, but hers as well.
Washington also told a story of 
road rage between an older Black 
woman and two young white men. 
The two white men jumped out of 
the car and started harassing the 
woman. Fearing for her life, she 
placed her gun on the passenger 
seat 
and 
was 
charged 
with 
brandishing a weapon. Though 
the older woman was acquitted, 
Washington said she thinks the 
situation would have progressed 
much differently if she was white. 
“If it had been a white man 
that pulled the gun out to protect 
himself, nine times out of ten no 
charges would have occurred,” 
Washington said. “But it was a 
Black woman, so she was charged 
was brandishing a weapon.”

C.S. Mott hosts 
car show for kids

Friendship inspires 
annual event on
roof for children
in hospital

On Sunday morning, around 
150 kids, family members and 
more 
than 
200 
volunteers 
gathered on top of the parking 
garage at C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital at the University of 
Michigan for the sixth annual 
Caden’s Car Show. 
The car show takes place 
every year during the summer 
and is preceded by a fundraiser 
the Friday before the show. 
Full Throttle, an organization 
focused 
on 
congenital 
heart 
research, raised around $68,000 
dollars this year. 
The car show is a way to 
brighten the Mott patients’ day 
and to raise awareness for organ 
donation, according to Christine 
La 
Jeunesse, 
administrative 
director for Congenital Heart 
Center at Mott. La Jeunesse said 
she has helped plan the event 
for the past few years and said it 
positively impacts patients. 
“For 
the 
families 
in 
the 
hospital it’s time away from a 
difficult time in their life,” La 
Jeunesse said. “It’s sunshine and 
a sense of hope for the future. “
Caden’s Car Show grew out 
of a friendship between Jean 

Jennings, former president and 
editor-in-chief 
of 
Automobile 
Magazine, and Caden Bowles, a 
young boy born with hypoplastic 
left heart syndrome, which left 
him with half a heart. Caden had 
a passion for cars that rivaled 
most 
car 
experts, 
Jennings 
said, which was apparent to 
everyone he met. The fundraiser 
is named after a hand-drawn car 
newsletter Caden created. 
Meg 
Zamberlan, 
pediatric 
nurse practitioner and pediatric 
heart 
transplant 
program 
coordinator at Mott’s congenital 
heart center, called Automobile 
Magazine when Jennings worked 
as Editor in Chief, and Jennings 
decided to go and visit seven-
year-old Caden. Caden was in the 
hospital with cancer resulting 
from anti-rejection drugs from 
the heart transplant he had when 
he was one. 
Jennings said when she walked 
into Caden’s room he was talking 
about Jaguar cars, and she was 
immediately taken with him. 
“I walked in that room and 
I could see the ball of light 
surrounding 
him,” 
Jennings 
said. “This kid was something to 
reckon with. He was so engaging, 
he was so amazing.” 
They 
quickly 
formed 
a 
friendship. Jennings said she 
brought him toy cars and books, 
and they wrote letters to each 
other after Jennings left.

LSA 
junior 
Morgan 
McCaul has been selected 
by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 
pending state senate approv-
al, to serve on the Michigan 
Board of Athletic Trainers as 
a representative of the gen-
eral public. McCaul, a sister 
survivor and sexual assault 
prevention advocate, said her 
personal experiences with 
athletic trainers give her a 
different view to bring to the 
board.
“I think I have a unique 
perspective to bring to the 
board, because not only was 
I introduced to the profes-
sion of athletic training as a 
patient, but I was also victim-
ized during that introduction 
— under the guise of medical 
treatment — and the failure 
to ensure that proper pro-
cedures were taking place,” 
McCaul said. “My priority is 
really the safety and wellbe-
ing of all Michiganders both 
in their lives outside of that 
exam room, but also inside 
of it.”
The statewide board is 
tasked with overseeing the 
continued 
education 
and 
competency of those who 
hold licenses and taking 
action against those who 
have adversely affected the 
health, safety and welfare of 
the public. It is comprised of 
11 total voting members — six 
athletic trainers, two physi-
cians and three public mem-
bers — with terms lasting 
four years.
Tiffany Brown, Whitmer’s 
press secretary, wrote in a 
statement to The Daily that 
Whitmer sees McCaul play-
ing an active role in ensuring 
the work of athletic trainers 
is conducive to rehabilitation 
and improved health.
“Athletic 
trainers 
are 
vital to the treatment and 
management 
of 
individu-
als to prevent injury and aid 
in rehabilitation and condi-
tioning,” Brown wrote. “The 

administration is proud to 
appoint Morgan McCaul to 
further the mission of the 
Michigan Board of Athletic 
Trainers.”
McCaul works at Safe-
House, an organization dedi-
cated to ending domestic 
violence and sexual abuse, 
and is involved with the 
University of Michigan Sex-
ual Assault Prevention and 
Awarness Center. She also 
serves on the board of the 
Jane Doe Fund, a pro-
choice advocacy group, 
and as a consultant 
for Survivor Strong, a 
support network aid-
ing survivors through 
advocacy and educa-
tion.
Part 
of 
the 
reason her 
abuser 
could 
work for 
so 
long 
without 
anyone 
raising 
a 
red flag was 
his 
alleged 
expertise in the 
field of athletic 
training. 
One 
of 
McCaul’s 
goals 
as 
a 
public mem-
ber, she said, 
is to make 
inroads 
in 
increasing 
account-
ability 
as 
well 
as 
educating 
patients. 
McCaul also 
said 
she 
hopes 
to 
create 
a 
culture of 
trauma-
informed 
care 
among ath-
letic train-
ers 
and 
other 
medical 
profes-
sionals.

“Especially as a repre-
sentative of the general pub-
lic, I want to do outreach,” 
McCaul said. “It’s a passion 
of mine to be a facilitator of 
connections and education, 
so I think using my back-
ground and my professional 
experience in the violence 
prevention sphere can be 
something that’s really bene-
ficial. I hope to bring trauma-
informed discussions into 
the medical profession, both 
inside and outside 
of my role as a 
board member.”
According to 
the 
SAMHSA-
HRSA 
Center 
for 
Integrated 
Health Solutions, 
an organi-
zation 

run by the 
National 

C
o
u
n
c
i
l
 for 
Behav-
ioral 
Health, 
trauma-
informed 
care recog-
nizes 
the 
widespread 
impact 
of 
trauma, 
as 
well as the 
signs 
and 
symptoms 
of 
trauma 
and 
inte-
grates knowl-
edge 
about 
trauma 
into 
policies, pro-
cedures 
and 
practices. 

With the goal 
of 
avoiding 
retraumati-
zation, 
trau-
ma- informed 
approaches 
are linked to 
positive health 
outcomes 
for 
patients.
University 
alum 
Laura 
Sinko, 
who 
wrote 
her 
Ph.D. 
in 

Nursing dissertation about 
trauma and inclusive health-
care, said survivors should 
have a seat at the table in 
health care discussions. Just 
as medical professionals do 
not know the full extent of 
their patients’ injuries with-
out listening to them, she 
said, care cannot be as effec-
tive as possible without lis-
tening to those who seek it.
Sinko 
said 
trauma-
informed care at its core 
is helping patients receive 
the 
professional 
medi-
cal treatment they need in 
order to reach their desired 
physical state. She said this 
type of care is like wearing 
gloves when touching blood 
because it is an approach 
that ensures every person is 
being treated safely, regard-
less of prior experiences.
“Whenever you’re touch-
ing blood products, you need 
to wear these gloves, because 
you never know what’s going 
on in their blood and what 
they’ve 
been 
through,” 
Sinko said. “You want to 
protect yourself but you also 
want to protect them. I think 
of this similarly to trauma-
informed care — you always 
want to be wearing those 
gloves when you’re interact-
ing with patients, because 
just because a patient hasn’t 
disclosed a traumatic expe-
rience to us doesn’t mean it 
hasn’t occurred.”
Sinko noted that many 
people have faced some 
form of trauma, and a trau-
ma-informed 
approach 
can reduce stress among 
patients. A study from SAM-
HSA-HRSA found 61 per-
cent of men and 51 percent 
of women report exposure 
to at least one traumatic life 
event.
A key part of trauma-
informed care, Sinko said, is 
respecting both the patients’ 
boundaries as well as includ-
ing survivors in conversa-
tions about health care.

Thousands of vegans and 
vegetarians traveled to the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Fair-
grounds on Saturday, Aug. 
3, for the third annual Great 
Lakes Regional VegBash, a 
Midwestern vegan and veg-
etarian food festival. Attend-
ees 
sampled 
and 
bought 
various 
food, 
crafts 
and 
health products from a wide 
range of vendors based across 
Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and 
Illinois. 
Bill Lonskey, the event 
organizer and owner of the 
Quintessential Event Compa-
ny, explained he started the 
event hoping to help attend-
ees discover new foods. 
“We’re a unique event for 
vegans and vegetarians and 
those who are interested in 
exploring more plant-based 
options in their diet to come 
out and check out some won-
derful restaurants,” Lonskey 
said. 
The theme of VegBash 2019 
was “The Summer of Veggie 
Love” in honor of the 50th 
anniversary of Woodstock, 

a 1969 music festival widely 
associated with the American 
counterculture 
movement 
of the 1960s. In line with the 
theme, attendees had the 
opportunity to speak briefly 
on camera about an area of 
activism they are passionate 
about as they walked in. 
The project, a new intro-
duction this year, will be 
compiled into a series of vid-
eos later posted online, Lon-
skey said. 
“Woodstock and the whole 
hippie movement was a pin-
nacle time of activism in this 
country,” Lonskey said. “Veg-
ans and vegetarians particu-
larly are very much into their 
activism, so we saw a lot of 
correlation there.” 
This spirit for activism is 
at the core of Radical Plants, 
a 
vegan-specialty 
foods 
company owned by Melissa 
Heath. By introducing cus-
tomers to superdip, the com-
pany’s 
oil-free, 
sugar-free 
dip, Heath said she hopes to 
inspire people to follow the 
company’s slogan and “eat 
plants for a change.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I 

remember my early childhood 
as the stack of picture books 
my parents read to my brother 
and me each night before we went 
to bed. My consistent reading habits 
were rooted in these bedtime stories 
and grew throughout my primary 
school experience. I would take 
bi-weekly library trips with my mom 
that would result in her cutting the 
stack of eight novels I brought up to 
checkout to four. I had every reading 
phase a young, Gen Z child could 
have, from my obsession with “Harry 
Potter” to the classic “Little House on 
the Prairie,” both of which I enjoyed 
while using the flashlight I hid under 
my bed so I could stay up for “just 
one more chapter.” But as life got 
busier and filled with school, work 
and the balance of everything else, 
recreational reading began to take a 
backseat in my life.
I’m a communication studies 
and film, television and media 
double major. I am an editor 
and (sometimes) writer for The 
Michigan Daily. I research current 
events and build presentations 
for the Residential College forum 
I co-facilitate. I’ve spent the last 
10 weeks of my summer working 
as an archival research assistant. 
While I still read constantly, it’s 
hard to find the drive to read 
anything not assigned to me in one 
of 
my 
communication-centered 
obligations. I’m confident this 
feeling is a popular sentiment 
among other college students.
Research highlights that reading 
for pleasure can lead to an increase 
in empathy, improved interpersonal 

relationships, 
reductions 
in 
the 
effects of depression and an increase 
in general well-being. Additionally, 
promoting reading for pleasure 
— especially among children — 
is considered so important that 
professors like Jeffrey D. Wilhelm 
dub it a civil rights issue, an argument 
taken by him and colleague Michael 
W. Smith in their book “Reading 
Unbound,” due to pleasure reading 
being a “more powerful predictor 
than even parental socioeconomic 
status and educational attainment.” 
Major longitudinal studies highlight 
the same set of facts about reading 
in youth: It is one of the greatest 
explanatory factors of cognitive 
progress and social mobility. 
However, despite these benefits, 
the 2018 American Time Use Survey 
performed by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics found that the share of 
Americans 15 and older who read 
for pleasure fell by more than 30 
percent since 2004 — dropping from 
28 percent to 19 percent. This raises 
the question: If the general American 
public isn’t prioritizing reading, how 
is the next generation going to?
While my reading has decreased 
over the past few years, my connection 
to it has not. I still acknowledge the 
impact of reading and writing on my 
thinking, on my understanding of the 
world and other identities, on me as 
a person. Reading provides insight 
into alternative experiences and 
perspectives — it is an introduction to 
the world as a multi-dimensional and 
complex space. These are the benefits 
of reading that every English teacher 
has raved about, but it’s something 

that American citizens — including 
myself — need to do a better job of 
encouraging in our communities 
and daily lives. We cannot allow 
reading rates to continue to decrease. 
We must push ourselves and those 
around us, especially those younger 
than us, to centralize reading. 
My inspiration for this op-ed 
spurred from the unfortunate passing 
of Nobel laureate Toni Morrison on 
Monday. Morrison’s contributions 
to literature are prolific, with a body 
of work that spans 11 novels and also 
includes both children’s books and 
essay collections. Her novels, which 
were revered by both the public and 
critics, illuminate the Black — and 
largely female — experience through 
awe-inspiring prose. Reading about 
her loss saddened me on behalf of 
the American public. Her words 
impacted so many minds and hearts. 
“Beloved,” the winner of the 1988 
Pulitzer Prize and one of my favorite 
novels of all time, taught me lessons 
about home, memory and gender 
that I didn’t know I needed to learn 
until after I closed back cover. And 
these feelings of mourning have 
been common, as evident from the 
outcries of sympathy and admiration 
by famous figures, as well as the posts 
by many of my friends, indicating 
a deeper emotional and social 
connection to reading that should be 
spread throughout our country.

AKAASH TUMULURI | COLUMN

D

isney just broke (its 
own) record for annu-
al box office earnings 
with five months still to go in 
2019. The number? $7.67 billion. 
That’s on track for $13.15 billion 
by the end of the year, which 
would almost double the $7.61 
billion record they set in 2016. 
Disney’s direct production stu-
dio, Buena Vista, has captured 
38 percent of the market share 
so far this year, and that doesn’t 
even include the earnings from 
recent acquisitions like 21st 
Century Fox (home of “Dark 
Phoenix,” “Bohemian Rhapso-
dy”) and multi-studio produc-
tions like “Spiderman: Far From 
Home.” But even excluding 
those, Disney’s slate this year 
has been ludicrous: “Avengers: 
Endgame,” “Aladdin” and “The 
Lion King” have all grossed over 
$1 billion each.
With “Frozen 2” and the 
“Star Wars” finale waiting in 
the wings to close out the year, 
the house of mouse should find 
themselves even more comfort-
able after a profitable 2019. But 
do you notice something about 
all these movies? They’re either 
part of — or ending — an exist-
ing franchise or a remake. So, 
is the industry slowly becom-
ing a vacuum for originality? Or 
is Disney, in its role as market-
maker, leading the industry 
away from what Walt himself 
used to embody: creativity and 
innovation?
Obviously, this is an exag-
geration. There are still origi-
nal movies. This past weekend, 
Quentin 
Tanrantino’s 
“Once 
Upon a Time … In Hollywood” 
rewrote history, and Jordan 
Peele stripped away the comfort 
of seeing our own reflection with 
“Us” earlier this year. But both 
of those movies were greenlit, 
for the most part, because both 
directors have track records of 
success. That’s really all Dis-
ney wants: proven capability in 
the market. Few truly original 
scripts are even produced for 
the silver screen these days, a 
symptom of streaming com-
panies like Netflix, Hulu and 
Amazon buying and turning 
those ideas into longer-form, 
binge-worthy content that can 
be re-signed for a second season 
if successful. In short, they turn 
those ideas into TV. 
Movies have followed suit. 
Instead of “Toy Story: Season 

4”, we get “Toy Story 4.” We get 
a spit-shined “The Lion King” 
remake with diversity to some-
what rectify the vanilla original 
cast of a movie set in Africa. But 
it’s not just Disney. Lionsgate’s 
biggest movie this year is “John 
Wick: Chapter 3.” Sony’s biggest 
movie this year is “Spider-Man: 
Far From Home” (which was 
still made in conjunction with 
Marvel, owned by Disney). Uni-
versal’s biggest movie is about 
to be, barring a catastrophic 
fluke, “Fast & Furious Presents: 
Hobbs & Shaw.” Their current 
worldwide biggie is “How to 
Train Your Dragon: The Hid-
den World,” which is intellec-
tual property from an acquired 
company (DreamWorks Anima-
tion). Warner’s biggest movie 
will most likely be “It Chapter 
Two,” and Paramount’s biggest 
is likely to be “Terminator: Dark 
Fate,” per Scott Mendelson of 
Forbes.

So, it’s tough to say that 
Disney has caused this prolif-
eration of recycled intellec-
tual property. Moviegoers in a 
content-saturated, streaming-
dominated market want to have 
some security in their invest-
ment, especially when they 
could’ve just stayed at home 
and watched something else on 
their streaming app of choice. 
“Going to the movies” just isn’t 
necessary anymore. The pub-
lic now requires the movie to 
be “an event” to even show up. 
“Avengers,” “The Lion King,” 
“Star Wars”: we go to those 
movies for the community pres-
ence, the experience of shared 
fandom and the nostalgia of 
growing with characters. And 
that is why Disney owns the box 
office — they own nostalgia. 
Millennials who grew up on the 
Disney animated features of the 
’90s are having their own chil-
dren, and Disney is hoping to 
influence them also, continuing 

the cycle of recycled nostalgia.
The one good part about 
remaking movies is the oppor-
tunity to fix their original mis-
takes. Disney, in particular, 
has made a conscious effort to 
rectify the diversity issues that 
have plagued Hollywood, with 
“Black 
Panther,” 
“Aladdin” 
and “The Lion King” featuring 
diverse casts, the remake of “A 
Little Mermaid” featuring an 
African American Ariel, and 
“Captain Marvel” showing off 
a strong female lead. That is 
the most valuable asset of the 
Disney “entertaimpire”: the 
ability to introduce diversity 
and still make money.
Movies like “If Beale Street 
Could Talk,” “BlacKkKlans-
man” and “Moonlight,” while 
highlighting stories less told 
and 
winning 
Oscars, 
will 
never net anywhere near the 
amount any Marvel movie 
will — so Marvel can afford, 
and is given the freedom, to 
franchise a movie with an all-
Black cast; the “suits” of enter-
tainment can still expect to 
make back their investments 
with “Black Panther 2.” But 
nowhere in the future will we 
be seeing a “BlacKkKlansman 
2,” so we need to see diversity 
wherever we can, even if it is 
under a superhero costume 
or princess makeup. It is also 
why those voices of diversity 
are starting to be heard louder 
on TV and streaming media. 
Shows like “Atlanta,” “Inse-
cure,” “Master of None” and 
“Ramy” are winning Emmys 
and slaying ratings, because 
money is made differently and 
audiences 
want 
something 
different in TV than in tradi-
tional films.
So, until Disney runs out 
of iterations of its own ideas, 
it seems like we’re due for 
a slate of stories that we’ve 
heard before, at least on the 
big screen. And with Dis-
ney+ launching in 2020, don’t 
expect the king of entertain-
ment to give up its crown any-
time soon. If you’re looking 
for something new, something 
authentic or something that’s 
plain different, look on your 
phone. You’re more likely to 
find it there than anywhere 
else.

Disney’s monopoly on nostalgia

I

t’s been a pretty hectic sum-
mer. Twenty Democrats have 
debated each other on stage 
twice in the lead up to what might 
be America’s most important elec-
tion. The nation has seen divisive 
language coming to a nasty head. 
And Hannah B. ended her season of 
“The Bachelorette” by picking lying 
Jed, who she later dumped, instead 
of picture-perfect Tyler. America has 
been through a lot.
I’ve spent this summer trying to 
make sense of it all in the best way I 
know how — finding a center in pop 
culture. Pop culture is often mocked, 
the people who follow it ridiculed. 
If you can name every “Real House-
wife” or every song on today’s Top 40, 
you’re viewed as less intelligent and 
less in touch with important societal 
events. I’ve found the very opposite to 
be true. 
The status of a society is often 
reflected in its culture. I don’t think 
anything speaks more to the major-
ity’s rejection of Trump than the fact 
that a country/rap song by a gay Black 
man is now the longest running Bill-
board No. 1 ever. Today’s pop culture 
looks a lot different from the media 
and music of 10 years ago. There are 
teenage gay couples on Disney, super-
heroes that little girls can become 
and an overall rise in the representa-
tion of people of color on TV. While 
there is still a long way to go before 
our media truly represents the lives 
and faces of the American people, the 
change in who we watch on TV or 
listen to on Spotify is reflected in our 
government. Of the top five Demo-
cratic presidential candidates, two 
are women and one — Senator Kamala 
Harris — is a Black woman who is the 
daughter of immigrants. Another top 
five candidate is an openly gay man. 
Public conversation on progressive 
policies are being driven by a young 
Latina woman. Politics is moving into 
the direction of true representation — 
but pop culture did it first.
Pop culture has seen female presi-
dents, a feat our own country has yet 
to achieve. Pop culture put a com-
mitted gay couple on screen six years 
before their marriage would be legal. 
From “Orange is the New Black” to 
“Hamilton,” pop culture has released 
visions and ideas into the world that 
one would not see if they merely read 
the first two pages of The New York 
Times without flipping to section C.
This isn’t a new development. 
Mass media and culture has long 
been seen as a liberal realm, one that 
will show the controversial material, 
albeit if for ratings, and get a conver-
sation started. Pop culture is where 

kids turn when they want to find ideas 
different than those spoiled by their 
parents, to discover if they disagree 
or not. So why should it be such a bad 
thing to turn to? Representation is 
important on so many levels. For the 
people being represented, it allows 
them to actually feel recognized, to 
see that their story is worth telling. On 
the other hand, it teaches those who 
may have grown up in a bubble and 
who were never exposed to stories 
other than those similar to their own. 
The face of the government doesn’t 
change unless the people want it to, 
and the people won’t want it to change 
unless they are accustomed to and 
accepting of a diversity that reflects 
the United States. Pop culture and 
media are great ways to provide such 
exposure. Yes, people will get angry, 
but society has slowly shifted towards 
broader representation, and what we 
see in media now is a lot different than 
what was shown fifty years ago.
This isn’t to say pop culture is the 
end all, be all of representation or 
progress. Pop culture still has plenty 
of issues with its portrayal of body 
image, race, gender, etc. I don’t believe 
pop culture is healthy when it is the 
center of your life, the sun around 
which you orbit. But being completely 
blind to it or scoffing at the notion of 
caring about it is lazy and pretentious. 
Politics, especially now, have just as 
much drama, ridiculous figures and 
toxic traits as an MTV reality show. 
It is in the harmony between these 
two toxic, exhausting industries that 
we find reason, and maybe a sliver of 
sense in this senseless world. 
If you spend every morning listen-
ing to The Daily podcast, then NPR 
News Now, then throw in a couple 
episodes of Lovett or Leave It, that’s 
great. But your worldview is more 
limited than you may think, and a 
huge problem with politics is the 
exclusivity associated with it by those 
who dedicate their lives to it. If you’re 
on the other end, and can list the past 
10 winners of Best Picture faster than 
the best 10 presidents, impressive. But 
the exclusivity of politics lives in part 
because few people make an effort 
to break it down. It may be silly to 
compare pop culture to politics, some 
may say it’s like comparing apples to 
oranges. But with a reality TV star as 
president and Broadway plays about 
former presidents, we have moved far 
past the blurring of the lines. It’s time 
to accept it, instead of reject it — you 
might be surprised by the things you 
learn.

There’s a saying that no one has 
your back like family. Through the 
good, the bad and the ugly, the peo-
ple who have been by our side from 
the start are (hopefully) the ones 
we can turn to when the going gets 
tough. With endless ways to define 
what makes a “family,” it would 
seem nearly impossible to capture 
the essence of the word in just one 
film. That said, by illuminating the 
universal inescapability of our roots, 
in “The Farewell,” director Lulu 
Wang (“Posthumous”) commendably 
depicts the power that the people 
who raise us and the places we call 
home have over us all. 
While navigating the trials and 
tribulations of young adulthood, 
independent and witty Billi (Awkwa-
fina, “Crazy Rich Asians”) learns of 
her beloved grandmother Nai Nai’s 
lung cancer diagnosis. Torn apart at 
the news, Billi is in disbelief over her 
family’s intentions not to tell Nai Nai 
(Shuzhen Zhou) she is fatally ill. As 
the extended family gathers together 
in China, under the guise of Billi’s 
cousin’s faux wedding, their reunion 
is bittersweet, with each family 
member anticipating the loss of the 
adored family matriarch. Though 

opposed to the family consensus, 
Billi promises to bite her tongue and 
play along with the fabrication, her 
heart set on enjoying what little time 
she has left with Nai Nai. 
Central to the film’s success is the 
pure, loving bond between Nai Nai 
and Billi. Despite the generational, 
cultural and lingual gaps between 
them, their connection is incred-

ibly strong. Awkwafina’s personable 
humor and Shuzhen Zhou’s embodi-
ment of Nai Nai’s matriarchal yet 
warm temperament is a dynamite 
combination. Their relationship gives 
the film focus, a point of reference 
that we graciously grab onto while 
confronting the complex overlap of 
funny and tear-jerking moments. 
When we look at Nai Nai and Billi, 
we don’t just see a grandmother and 
a granddaughter. We see a friendship, 
an attachment that is built on care, 
trust and love, not just shared blood.
While the film’s core revolves 
around the intricacy of familial love, 
the underlying narrative of Billi’s 
self-discovery journey holds a sig-

nificant role. Born Chinese but raised 
in the U.S., Billi’s visit to see Nai Nai 
pushes her to face the duality of her 
identity, as well as others’ percep-
tions of that duality. When checking 
into a hotel her first night in China, 
the concierge lights up at the revela-
tion that Billi is from the U.S., prob-
ing her about whether it is “better.” 
Billi awkwardly deflects the ques-
tion, answering that neither the U.S. 
or China is better, but both are differ-
ent. Though the context of the scene 
is quite lighthearted, Billi’s response 
holds a lot of depth. She has unbreak-
able ties to both countries, with some 
pieces of her rooted in America and 
others eternally belonging to China. 
Neither is superior to the other 
because both are, in their own ways, 
home. 
“The Farewell” reminds us that 
familial love, like love in all its forms, 
is messy. Though there are times that 
it pulls at our heart strings, there are 
others where it makes us belly laugh. 
The mixed emotions we feel per-
fectly tie into the complex feelings 
of grief, nostalgia and joy that the 
characters are grappling with. Filled 
with moments of beauty and sorrow, 
“The Farewell” may conjure up a 
few laughs, or even make you shed 
a few tears. One thing is certain 
though: When the lights go black, 
you’ll definitely want to give your 
grandma a call.

‘The Farewell’ is at once 
sorrowful and beautiful

FILM REVIEW

Hip hop’s most beloved boy 
band is back on the album roll-
out circuit for their upcoming 
record GINGER, and they’re 
here in full form on “I BEEN 
BORN AGAIN”: All six vocalists 
on the track, a bass-booming 
beat from in-house producers 
Romil 
Hemnani 
and 
Jabari 
Manwa and a gritty black-and-
white music video accompany-
ing the single.
The 
track 
starts 
with 
a 
breathy 
and 
blood-curdling 
intro that turns 
the 
group 
dynamic on its 
head once you 
realize it’s bear-
face delivering 
the sinister lyr-
ics. 
Although 
BROCKHAMP-
TON 
switched 
up 
their 
for-
mula in 2018, 
bearface is still 
the most unde-
rutilized vocal-
ist, making his 
appearance 
on 
album-closing 
ballads 
and 
the 
occasional 
bridge or chorus. Hopefully this 
teases more new bearface cuts 
to come.
Layers 
of 
instrumentation 
make waves on this beat, but it’s 
as if each sound pops in and out 
to give the others time to shine: 
piano keys, an ominous synth, 
record scratches, chants and 
claps and kicks and hats over 
a booming bass. It’s densely 
packed without being overbear-
ing, cartoonish but a little bit 
creepy — almost reminiscent of 
“The Grim Adventures of Billy 
& Mandy.”
Lyrics have been in tighter 
focus on more recent releases for 
the band, and here is no excep-
tion. Kevin Abstract’s verse is 
intensely personal as usual. He 
continues to talk about a lot of 
the things he spoke on in iri-
descence and his solo release 
ARIZONA BABY. Joba’s voice is 

eerily pitched for a chopped and 
screwed sound, and his abstract 
lyrics are silky smooth. 
Afterward the beat breaks 
down and an out-of-place bridge 
echoes, “You oughta be ashamed 
of yourselves.” Matt Champion 
closes the song with a catchy 
outro, but Dom Mclennon and 
Merlyn Wood don’t add much to 
the track — in fact, Merlyn man-
ages to make it weird in his brief 
appearance when he says, “She 
so bad I let her touch my butt.” 
It’s a goofy line and a mental 
image nobody asked for. (“Mer-
lyn, what the fuck?”)
One of the musical elements 
that garnered BROCKHAMP-
TON so much love 
on their SATU-
RATION 
trilogy 
is catchy hooks, 
the kind of cho-
rus 
that 
wraps 
its words around 
your brain. The 
group 
scrapped 
their 
sticky-
sounding 
hooks 
for more experi-
mental 
song 
structures on iri-
descence. A catchy 
hook is absent on 
“I BEEN BORN 
AGAIN” 
too, 
a 
sign that GINGER will continue 
to switch up the formula, exper-
imenting with their sound and 
structure.
While 
“I 
BEEN 
BORN 
AGAIN” shows that the chem-
istry is back and all the boys 
are showing up to bat, it’s easy 
to miss the old BROCKHAMP-
TON formula. Long gone are 
guarantees of a catchy hook 
from Kevin, or show-stealing 
verses from Matt and Dom. 
While the track still holds up, 
it’s hard not to think about it: If 
Dom and Merlyn’s quick verses 
and the bridge were cut and the 
song had a proper hook instead, 
the whole song would land so 
much stronger. It’s good that 
BROCKHAMPTON 
continues 
to experiment — the SATURA-
TION formula would get old 
after a while — but this track 
shows they still haven’t nailed a 
new dynamic.

“You can never publish my love,” 
Rogue Wave chants, in the song that 
the title of this series riffs on. Maybe 
that’s true, and we can never quite 
account for our love on paper or in 
print, but we sure can try. That’s what 
this series is devoted to: publishing our 
love. Us, the Arts section of The Michi-
gan Daily, talking about artists, some 
of the people we love the most. Perhaps 
these are futile approximations of love 
for the poet who told us we deserve to 
be heard, the director who changed the 
way we see the world, the singer we 
see as an old friend. But who ever said 
futile can’t still be beautiful?
The story of my love for Rufus 
Wainwright begins in a darkened 
auditorium. The crowd 
bustles, 
hushed giggles and whispers muted 
by the shuffle of feet returning to 
their spots. I was already seated, 
my face eerily blue as the light of 
my phone reflected back on me. The 
setlists for every previous artist lined 
the screen as my cursor dropped to 
the bottom. I don’t know anything 
by this guy, I thought. I didn’t know 
what he looked like, either, mistaking 
the guitar tech for the performer and 
prematurely clapping. On the second 

night of coverage for the Ann Arbor 
Folk Festival this year, I was expect-
ing more folk from the headliner. 
What I didn’t anticipate was some-
thing beyond any genre, a voice that 
would stick with me like a pleasant 
parasite for the foreseeable future.
I’m sure I had heard Wainwright’s 
music before in passing — The man 
is something of a musical unicorn, 
an artist Elton John once called “the 
greatest songwriter on the planet” 
and has released 10 albums, written 
two full-length operas and performed 
on five continents. Still, Wainwright 
is something of a well-kept secret for 
musicians and performers alike, as 
we cherish his success, but still hope 
to keep his genius to ourselves.
Rufus Wainwright isn’t just a sing-
er: He does everything, in a way you 
would never expect. His unpredict-
ability is delightful, his humor brash, 
his outlook both joyous and nihilistic. 
Everyone can get something out of 
his music, and the same person can 
gather different things from those 
songs throughout their life. Wain-
wright’s work is classic in that way, 
and translates to each era of growth 
like a well-loved novel might. 
So, when he finished his set that 
night in Ann Arbor, I turned to my fel-
low music writer to talk about it and 
realized that my face was wet with 
tears. The performance had been so 

moving that I hadn’t even realized I 
was crying in the first place. I have 
been in Hill Auditorium so many 
times that it barely feels like a venue 
anymore, but Wainwright changed 
that. My posture straightened, the 
beams vibrated with each note from 
his Steinway grand, his voice resonat-
ed through the half-shell auditorium 
like summer air. And from then on, I 
finally got it. 
All the things I hated about his 
voice with his first song of the set ― 
the nasality, the theatrical flair, the 
sarcasm in every word ― made sense 
by the end of the night. What Wain-
wright was doing wasn’t just putting 
on a show, but telling a drawn-out 
story of his life, of all of our lives in 
the microcosms of specific moments. 
From then on, I was hooked. 
His talent for capturing these 
moments, whether they are profound 
(“In the drifting white snow / You 
loved me” of “Dinner at Eight”), or 
darkly funny (“Now I’m drunk and 
wearing flip flops on Fifth Avenue” of 
“Poses”), is what makes Wainwright 
stand out. There are several artists 
from the early-aughts era he came up 
in who managed to fuse folk, rock and 
theatrics in the same way, like Regina 
Spektor and Imogen Heap, but no one 
does it quite as well as Rufus.
People tend to point to his musical 
heritage to divine the source of this 

talent, as he was parented by well-
known folk musicians Loudon Wain-
wright III and Kate McGarrigle, but 
I believe he is merely an unlikely 
product of his circumstances. He flit-
ted between Montreal and New York 
for much of his childhood, seeing the 
beauty and the ugliness of both cities 
in good time. By the time Wainwright 
reached adulthood, he was already 
fully self-realized, a proud gay man 
with a penchant for the weirder cor-
ners of this world. 
In one of his most well-known 
songs, “Cigarettes and Chocolate 
Milk,” Wainwright explains this 
plainly: “Everything it seems I like’s a 
little bit stronger / A little bit thicker, 
a little bit harmful for me.” The lyr-
ics dance over a polka piano beat, his 
languid baritone stretching across 
the notes like honey over toast. It just 
makes sense to the ears, like most 
of his work does. As a person who’s 
grown up around music for much of 
her life, listening to Wainwright’s 
songs is an equally inspiring and 
daunting experience.
His melodies aren’t obvious to the 
instrumentals, and sometimes a full 
horn section comes out of nowhere, 
but somehow, it works perfectly. He 
can blatantly steal a Spanish bolero 
beat (“Oh What A World”) and turn 
it into a meditation on modern life 
within five minutes. He can reap-
propriate a Beatles song (“Across the 

Universe”), a Leonard Cohen song 
(“Hallelujah”), and produce covers so 
convincing some people don’t realize 
they’re not his words. To me, Wain-
wright represents the infinite possi-
bilities of music, beyond what any of 
us could hum in the shower or think 
of in our wildest dreams. 
This translates beyond his studio 
recordings and into performance 
seamlessly. It’s why I cried in Hill 
Auditorium that night, and every 
time I’ve looked up live videos on 
YouTube since. I really can’t help 
it ― when someone captures the ups 
and downs of life in our fucked-up 
world so well, you have no choice but 
to let it take you on a ride. His songs 
feel like screaming out of windows 
on freeways, like walking through 
streetlight-dotted roads in the middle 
of the night, like tumbling out of the 
rain into a warm home.
His music is unabashedly truth-
ful, mixing the dirty laundry of real-
ity with the points of light along the 
way. And still, it never feels contrived. 
Wainwright knows how to write a 
song that will make you feel every-
thing at once, make everyone feel 
like a “beautiful child again.” From 
the soaring highs of happiness to the 
lowest lows of addiction and grief, he 
doesn’t hide anything. Wainwright 
embraces it, making the raw nerve of 
human emotion into a striking sculp-
ture of his own creation.

‘U’ study finds Flint an injust census district

School for Environment and Sustainability names most environmentally harmful areas in the country

A study published last month by 
the University of Michigan School 
for Environment and Sustainability 
reported Detroit, Grand Rapids, 

Flint, 
Saginaw, 
Lansing 
and 
Kalamazoo as some of the most 
environmentally unjust areas in the 
country.
University alum Laura Grier, 
Delia Mayor and Brett Zeuner 
co-authored the study with their 
faculty advisor, SEAS professor 

Paul Mohai. The group wrote in an 
email to The Daily the study is the 
first comprehensive quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
assessment 
of 
environmental justice in Michigan.
The 
researchers 
proved 
environmental injustice exists in 
the state of Michigan and an online 

environmental justice screening 
tool is feasible and desired. They 
also found a screening tool must be 
accompanied by strong state-level 
policy that supports communities 
burdened by high risk of exposure 
to environmental hazards.
Zeuner mentioned states like 
California use an environmental 
justice screening tool to leverage 
funding 
to 
communities 
most 
impacted by environmental justice 
issues. Grier added their study 
provides the state of Michigan 
with 
concrete, 
comprehensive 
and 
practical 
information 
about possible ways to address 
environmental 
injustices. 
She 
wrote she hopes Michigan adopts a 
similar screening tool.
“We also hope it encourages the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
and other national environmental 
leaders 
to 
consider 
cumulative 
impacts when making environmental 
decisions instead of one pollutant 
or facility at a time,” Grier wrote. 
“Specifically in Michigan, we hope 
this study encourages the State 
to adopt a screening tool, consult 
with 
impacted 
communities 
in 
permitting and policy decisions and 
consider cumulative environmental 
impacts.”
Mayor added if Michigan adopts 
an environmental justice screening 
tool, funding could be prioritized 
better and future environmental 
injustices could be avoided.
“We hope to see is that this 
information could be used by 
decision-makers to both prevent 
further environmental exposures 

and to prioritize allocation of 
funding to correct the already 
experienced 
impacts,” 
Mayor 
wrote.
The 
group 
partnered 
with 
the 
Michigan 
Environmental 
Justice Coalition to interview 30 
environmental justice leaders. They 
also used social and environmental 
data from the EPA, Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
and 
Census 
Bureau 
to 
rank 
Michigan’s census districts.
According to the researchers, 
the Flint water crisis was a result of 
environmental injustice. The water 
crisis began in April 2014 after the 
drinking water source for the city 
of Flint was changed from Lake 
Huron and the Detroit River to the 
Flint River to save money.
Several scientists including Mona 
Hanna-Attisha and Marc Edwards 
have denounced drinking water 
quality data collected under the 
Safe Drinking Water Act Lead and 
Copper Rule by the EPA during the 
Flint water crisis. Zeuner wrote 
the group didn’t use that data 
and instead used a lead exposure 
indicator from the EPA, which is the 
percentage of homes within a census 
district that were built before 1960. 
The researchers used the indicator 
to represent a risk of exposure from 
lead-based paint and lead pipes.
The research group quantified 
environmental 
injustice 
on 
a 
map and based injustice on 11 
environmental indicators and six 
demographic indicators.

Punjab. Literally the land of 
five rivers. . . or, well, it used to 
be. You see, even the name of 
our homeland brings pain these 
days. How can I tell you the pain 
of Punjab? Quite honestly, it is 
a pain that I can hardly even 
understand. My experience as 
a member of the Punjabi dias-
pora has been filled with tragic 
realizations, one after the other. 
In the moments where I realize 
that my Bebe Ji (maternal grand-
mother) did not just “develop” a 
brain tumor, but she likely devel-
oped it after growing up and 
spending much of her life in the 
“Cancer belt” of Punjab, a region 
so named due to the presence of 
villages having cancer rates near 
100 percent. This, of course, is 
the result of Indian state-man-

dated pesticides that used by 
farmers in the region. Mind you, 
those pesticides were not needed 
when farmers were able to grow 
the crops they wanted on their 
land. The Green Revolution and 
the Indian State, in collabora-
tion with powers in the West like 
Rockefeller, the U.S. and others, 
forced these farmers to adhere 
to Western standards of farming 
that were designed for high yield. 
What they did not realize was 
that these farmers had the wis-
dom of their ancestors and knew 
how to take care of this land. 
These crops and the water they 
require are drying up a water 
table that has allowed Punjab to 
be one of the most fertile places 
on earth, yet soon Punjab will be 
a desert. The land of five rivers 
reduced to none. The pain I feel 
comes from the fact that on this 
issue alone I could talk for days 
on end about farmer suicide, can-

cer rates, and how farming fami-
lies are slowly being destroyed 
by the Indian state. There are so 
many more issues in my ances-
tral homeland.
And you see it was these farm-
ers that invented this bhangra 
that you all enjoy so much, or 
perhaps you’ll recognize it more 
if I refer to it as “bong-ra”. You 
see, those same farmers that 
used to dance so joyously when 
their crops were successful are 
the ones committing suicide as 
their work only brings profits 
in their dreams these days. The 
five rivers are now diverted from 
the land of Punjab and sold back 
to Punjabi farmers. And yet that 
same water is sent to the rest of 
India for free. Yet I see so many 
engage in Punjabi culture with-
out even realizing that the deriv-
atives of my culture that they 
participate in may be all that is 
left of it in a few decades. All I ask 

is that you realize how little is 
left of authentic Punjabi culture 
and the fact that the Indian state 
is systematically destroying Pun-
jabi land and culture in a pure act 
of empire. The links to Palestin-
ians being robbed of their water 
by the Israeli state should be rec-
ognized, but this also just proves 
that Imperial states are not cre-
ative in their violence.
And of course, now we see 
Kashmir 
being 
prepared 
for 
full-on occupation as the Indian 
state, using their philosophy of 
Hindutva, attempts to finally 
complete its colonial project of 
destroying the one of the Mus-
lim-majority state in the South 
Asian region. Of course, I cannot 
do Kashmir justice in a few lines, 
but I plead to all of you to educate 
yourself on what is happening to 
my Kashmiris and Palestinians 
and support their resistance and 
efforts to finally be free. But I 

digress . . . 
This is not a claim of cultural 
appropriation. This is a plea to 
simply recognize that the mini-
mizing of Punjabi culture to 
songs about “Patiala peg” and 
whatever other intoxicant y’all 
want to romanticize this week 
is just another violence on top 
of what Punjab has been put 
through for the past 72 years if 
you want to only speak of Indian 
state-sponsored violence. I just 
hope that I will see some respon-
sibility in how Punjabi culture 
is represented in spaces and not 
simply minimized to hype music 
and getting hammered. For those 
of us that spend every day learn-
ing more and more about how 
much we lost, please remember 
us next time you understand 
Punjabi culture within this mini-
malistic lens. The spirit of Pun-
jab cannot be boxed in, no matter 
how hard y’all try.

Michigan hockey roster preview: An overview of returning players

The Michigan hockey team’s 
season ended earlier than expected 
in the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament in Minneapolis. After 
an 
inconsistent 
regular 
season, 
the Wolverines were unable to 
collect themselves and make a deep 
postseason run. Players and coaches 
alike assert that it was not a season 
up to par with normal program 
standards. If this year is any different, 
the returning players and coaches 
will need to turn the sour taste 
from last year into a sustained level 
of motivation and urgency that, at 
times, eluded last season’s team.
The Daily breaks down Michigan’s 
returning players for this season.
Senior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin
Martin enters his senior season as 
perhaps the most polished returning 
defenseman. He injured his left arm 
in February and missed the rest of the 
year. Prior to the injury, he recorded 
6 assists in 28 games, finishing with 
a plus-one rating in plus-minus — 
good for third-best among Wolverine 
defensemen.
Senior defenseman Griffin Luce
Luce finished with the team lead 
in blocked shots, 74, along with one 
goal and three assists last season. 
He was a mainstay on the left side 
of the blue line for Michigan last 
year, appearing in 35 games. Prior to 
Martin’s injury in February, the two 
were a strong defensive pairing. If the 
two are paired together once again 
for their senior seasons, expect solid 
defense and physicality at the cost of 
some offensive upside.
Sophomore defenseman Jack 
Summers
Summers received inconsistent 
playing time to begin his freshman 
campaign. After the injury to Martin, 
Summers was frequently slotted 
alongside Nick Boka. The sophomore 
is a solid skater with offensive 
potential. He finished with one goal 
and 10 assists over 29 games last year. 
It would not come as a surprise to see 
him take on a more consistent role 
next season as an extra defenseman 
or starter, in light of the departures of 
Joseph Cecconi and Quinn Hughes.
Sophomore defenseman Jake 
Gingell
Gingell appeared in only one 
game last season after spending 
two seasons in the USHL with the 
Youngstown Phantoms. The physical 
lefty may be an option for Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson as an extra skater 
after a season of getting accustomed 

with the program.
Senior defenseman Christian 
Meike
Meike played in two games 
last season, recording a goal in an 
exhibition match against Waterloo. 
The senior adds depth to the defense 
— whether he will receive extended 
playing time remains to be seen.
Sophomore 
defenseman/
forward Nick Blankenburg
Blankenburg was arguably the 
most impressive freshman on the 
team last season. He is a fast skater 
and good shot creator — dynamic 
enough to receive time at both 
forward and defenseman. Pearson 
referred to Blankenburg as a “Quinn 
Hughes lite.”
The sophomore did struggle at 
times as an off-puck defender but 
showed the ability to make up for it 
with his aggressiveness and speed. If 
he cuts down on his defensive gambles 
and becomes more comfortable as a 
defender, he will continue to make an 
impact on both ends of the ice.
Junior forward Jack Becker
At six-foot-four and 205 pounds, 
Becker has the potential to be a 
dominant forward on the ice. After 
a promising freshman season in 
which he recorded 15 points and two 
game-winning goals, he turned in 
similar numbers in his sophomore 
campaign — 15 points on six goals and 
nine assists. Becker can be one of the 
driving forces on offense if he sees an 
uptick in production.
Senior forward Will Lockwood
Lockwood faced the decision 
of whether to leave for the NHL 
or return for his senior season this 
summer. He chose the latter and 
became the 100th captain in program 
history.
The 
Bloomfield 
Hills-native 
led the Wolverines with 16 goals 
and will spearhead the offense 
once again. His combination of 
speed and stick handling makes 
him a difficult matchup for most 
collegiate defenders. The second-
round selection by the Canucks is 
Michigan’s most polished scorer and 
became one of the main sources of 
offense after Josh Norris’s season-
ending injury in January. Lockwood 
will be featured on the top line, likely 
alongside some combination of senior 
forwards Jake Slaker, Nick Pastujov 
and junior Jack Becker.
Junior forward Dakota Raabe
Last season, Raabe was a part 
of two units that impressed and 
improved as the season progressed. 
His line with Garrett Van Wyhe 
and Nolan Moyle drew praise from 
Pearson for their yeoman-like effort. 

For that reason, Van Wyhe and 
Raabe were often called upon to kill 
penalties.
Raabe is among the fastest skaters 
on the team, and despite his relatively 
small stature, was also among the 
team leaders in blocked shots for 
a forward. After an impressive 
sophomore season, expect Raabe 
to continue to make strides on the 
penalty kill as well as improving his 
offensive repertoire.
Senior forward Jake Slaker
Slaker enters his senior season 
as a potential top-line forward and 
figures to be a big part of the offense 
once again. He excelled on the top 
line at the beginning of the year 
alongside Norris and Lockwood, 
but eventually switched lines after 
Norris’s injury. Slaker was streaky 
last year, accumulating the majority 
of his points at the beginning of the 
season before going into a midseason 
slump. The lefty has a strong shot, 
good vision and often played around 
the net.
Senior forward Adam Winborg
Winborg struggled to crack the 
rotation early on in his junior season. 
But by the time November came 
around, he was receiving consistent 
playing time. First it was his faceoff 
success the impressed. Over his first 
three games last season, he went 
18-26 in the faceoff circle. Then, 
he showed enough consistency for 
Pearson to decide to keep Winborg 
in the lineup — he went on to play 
in 27 games, recording five points. 
Entering his senior season, he brings 
a solid faceoff presence and stability 
up the middle of the ice.
Sophomore 
forward 
Jack 
Olmstead
Olmstead appeared in seven games 

last season, scoring his only goal in 
a 3-1 victory against St. Lawrence. 
Perhaps after a year of building 
familiarity with the program, he will 
receive an extended opportunity for 
ice time.
Junior 
forward 
Michael 
Pastujov
Pastujov is a skilled skater and 
playmaker 
who 
showed 
some 
inconsistency throughout last season. 
After recording three points over 
the first four games of the season 
and being featured on the top line, 
he hit a dry spell. From Oct. 7 to 
Dec. 1, Pastujov recorded just one 
point and missed three games due 
to injury. After being a healthy 
scratch at Ohio State in January, 
he rebounded and reemerged as a 
contributor — including five goals 
over the course of two series against 
Penn State and Michigan State. If he 
can piece together a consistent year, 
Pastujov can help address some of the 
Wolverines’ offensive woes from last 
season. 
Senior forward Nick Pastujov
Pastujov has improved upon his 
season totals in each of his three 
seasons thus far. Last season, he 
finished with 11 goals and 13 assists — 
often slotted in alongside Lockwood 
after the injury to Norris. Pastujov 
told the Daily earlier this summer 
that though the confidence in his 
game is high, he is still looking to 
make strides and continue his trend. 
Pastujov, along with Lockwood and 
Slaker will lead Michigan’s offensive 
attack this winter.
Sophomore forward Garrett 
Van Wyhe
Van Wyhe is often one of the larger 
players on the ice, but what makes 
his skillset unique is his combination 

of size and speed. It made him an 
effective penalty killer alongside 
Raabe and contributed towards 
his four goals and six assists over 
36 games. Van Wyhe continued to 
improve as the season progressed. If 
that trend continues, he will play an 
even larger role next season.
Sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert
The sophomore forward played 
in 31 games, tallying four goals and 
nine assists for thirteen points. In the 
latter half of the year, he broke out 
of his slump and started producing, 
scoring and assisting on two big goals 
against Wisconsin late in the seasons.
Redshirt-junior forward Luke 
Morgan
Morgan played in all 36 games last 
season, finishing with six goals and 
seven assists. He is a physical forward 
who became a solid contributor after 
getting off to a slow start on the 
stats sheet. Expect Morgan to play 
an equally big role this season in his 
second season on the ice.
Sophomore 
forward 
Nolan 
Moyle
Moyle appeared in 30 games last 
season, putting up seven goals and 
three assists. He offered a consistent 
physical presence on the fourth line 
alongside Raabe and Van Wyhe. 
Once the line founds its chemistry, 
Moyle found his groove. If he makes 
the jump with the rest of the fourth 
line, Moyle could become a 20-point 
scorer.

Four position battles to watch as Michigan starts fall camp

It must be August already, 
because 
fall 
camp 
is 
just 
starting to ramp up under the 
distinct whiff of optimism. The 
possibilities for the Michigan 
football team are endless and the 
hope, as it always does about this 
time, springs eternal. 
This summer, that enthusiasm 
is catalyzed by the promise of a 
revamped, modernized offense 
from new offensive coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis. 
The 
Michigan 
offense returns at least seven 
starters from last year’s squad, 
led by senior quarterback Shea 
Patterson — and all-Big Ten 
caliber receivers, Nico Collins 
and 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones. 
If Gattis is the engine behind 
the hype train, that trio is the 
wheels.
The 
defensive 
alignment 
comes with a few extra question 
marks this year. The Wolverines 
lost several key contributors 
from 
last 
year’s 
defense, 
including 
first-round 
picks 
Devin Bush and Rashan Gary, 
along with Chase Winovich and 
David Long, among others. The 
unit is once again backstopped 
by Don Brown, though, who 
has coached his defense to no 
worse than third in the nation in 
total defense during his time at 
Michigan. 
For now, that all amounts to 
a consensus, if not unilateral, 
anointment as the preseason Big 
Ten favorite. But there is still 
plenty to be sorted out before 
the ball kicks at the Big House in 
25 days. Here are four position 
battles — two on offense, two on 
defense — to monitor throughout 
the coming weeks.
Stueber vs. Mayfield at right 
tackle: 
The battle for the fifth and 
final starting offensive line spot 
appears to be the most high-
profile, mano-a-mano battle on 
the team. Junior Andrew Stueber 
played in 11 games last year, 
including starts against Ohio 
State and Florida when Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty was injured at the 
end of the year. Perhaps there’s 
something to glean from those 
starts, as Stueber largely held his 
own in both games. That hardly 
influenced the outcome of either 
game, of course — two losses by a 
combined 49 points.
Jalen Mayfield comes in with 

less experience, but might have 
the higher upside of the two. 
After coming to Michigan a 
highly-touted recruit, Mayfield 
secured his redshirt last season 
while still appearing in three 
games. He’s a guy who, long-
term, has the athletic build to be 
a starter at either tackle spot.
For now, this one seems to 
be roughly a coin flip. The two 
split reps in the spring game 
and 
spring 
public 
practices. 
Mayfield brings the upside and 
athleticism of a potential future 
NFL pick, Stueber carries the 
experience and reliability the 
coaches covet. Both will likely 
get their shot early in the season 
to be the entrenched starter, 
with the high likelihood — either 
via injury or rotation — that both 
see major time this year.
Who’s going to step up at 
running back?
Karan Higdon is gone, and 
so goes his 1,178 yards and 
224 carries from a year ago. 
The remaining running backs/
fullbacks on the roster — Tru 
Wilson, 
Zach 
Charbonnet, 
Christian 
Turner, 
Ben 
Van 
Sumeran and Ben Mason — bring 
a combined 119 career carries 
and 544 yards into fall camp. 
That’s not to say the cupboard 
is entirely barren, but for now, 
there are more questions than 
answers.
Much is made of Wilson’s 
tenacity and shiftiness, but what 
really endears him most to the 
coaching staff, and thus what 
makes him the safest option at 
the moment, is his sound pass-
blocking. He is the de facto 
starter until someone takes it 
from him. With uncertainty 
abound, that’s no inevitability.
Charbonnet 
has 
been 
handicapped by a knee injury 
that held him out of spring 
practice, 
making 
the 
uphill 
battle of freshman fall camp an 
even more lofty burden. He is, 
however, the most highly-touted 
running back recruit Michigan 
has had in quite some time — and 
the staff has done nothing but 
sing his praises in the interim. 
Turner flashed glimpses of his 
vision and quickness in the Peach 
Bowl loss to Florida, including a 
41-yard touchdown run that was 
eventually called back. He also 
tallied 55 yards in a win against 
Nebraska earlier in the year. If 
anyone is to snatch Higdon’s 
workhorse 
mantle, 
it 
seems 

likeliest to come from Turner, a 
running back of similar ilk.
Smart 
money 
is 
on 
a 
by-committee approach, with 
Turner ending up with the 
highest snap count of the group, 
and Van Sumeran and Mason 
grabbing a few carries here and 
there. Charbonnet, ultimately, 
is the wild card. If he makes the 
most of an opportunity early, 
he could ascend earlier than 
expected.
What will Daxton Hill’s role 
look like?
Is this a cop-out? Sure. But 
where — and if — Daxton Hill 
sees regular time from the get-
go might be the most intriguing 
defensive storyline still to sort 
out. He comes to Michigan one 
of the most coveted recruits 
in 
program 
history, 
with 
experience at safety but talent 
to play elsewhere. Safety is an 
option. He could slot at VIPER. 
He could play nickel. 
There 
is 
a 
more 
obvious 

immediate 
need 
at 
nickel, 
with scant cornerback depth 
potentially looming. If you view 
Hill as a plug-and-play, three-
year starter at safety, though, 
there is a real question as to why 
you’d then risk hindering his 
development simply to Band-Aid 
over a short-term need. This is a 
guy who could be a top-10 pick 
one day. You want to mess with 
that?
That all assumes Hill — who 
did not enroll early — is ready 
to go from day one. Even for the 
elite of the elite, that’s not an 
assumption you can bank on.
What happens to the second 
cornerback spot?
The cornerback room was 
already thin. Now, it appears, 
an injury to Ambry Thomas is 
adding to that strain.
“Ambry Thomas... he’s working 
through a little something right 
now,” Harbaugh told reporters 
at Big Ten Media Days. “We’re 
hopeful he’ll get back with us.”

That ambiguity cannot be a 
welcome sign, weeks before a 
season that portended Thomas’ 
breakout. He was the natural 
heir to David Long’s spot on 
the other end of Lavert Hill. If 
Thomas is in fact healthy and 
ready to go, he could still occupy 
that spot, all of that could still 
come to fruition.
If not, the Wolverines will 
have a competition of guys 
without much experience. The 
2018 recruiting class featured 
four 
cornerbacks, 
of 
which 
Vincent Gray appears the closest 
to breaking through. Gemon 
Green and D.J. Turner could 
figure into that mix, too. This 
spring will be about identifying 
which, if any, of those guys could 
be ready to play meaningful time 
— and if Thomas will be ready to 
go.
If 
the 
answer 
to 
those 
questions is no, the defense could 
find itself in some real trouble 
before too long.

Notebook: Josh Gattis talks offense at the start of fall camp

At Big Ten Media Days last month, 
Maryland coach Mike Locksley 
made headlines in characterizing 
the workload distribution between 
himself and Josh Gattis.
The 
two 
were 
co-offensive 
coordinators at Alabama last year, 
though 
Gattis’ 
responsibilities 
also included the receivers. When 
Locksley got the Maryland job, he 
originally intended to bring Gattis 
with him, per reports at the time, 
but then Jim Harbaugh got involved. 
Gattis instead went to Michigan, 
taking sole responsibility of the 
Wolverines’ offense.
“(Gattis) was very helpful as an 
assistant in our program,” Locksley 
said last month. “He had an 
opportunity to see me call every play 
and put together game plans.”
On Wednesday, speaking to media 
for the first time since Michigan 
opened fall camp last week, Gattis 
confirmed that he wasn’t calling 
plays for the Crimson Tide, as he 

will for the Wolverines. However, 
he took some exception to the latter 
part of Locksley’s comments.
“Mike Locksley can say I watched 
him call every play, but ask him 
where the game plans usually come 
from,” Gattis said. “So I’m fine with 
that. He did call every play, and I’ve 
got a notebook upstairs with all the 
game plans written down in them. 
But I’ve got tremendous respect for 
him, obviously.”
Sniping 
aside, 
Gattis 
faces 
the mammoth task of satiating 
expectation that has only grown 
since the spring. Michigan’s offense 
returns most of its starters, including 
senior quarterback Shea Patterson, 
and with Gattis running the show 
and implementing a spread, it’s 
expected to buoy the Wolverines.
It’s the first time during the Jim 
Harbaugh era that the comfort of 
the fan base rests on the offense. 
Gattis — as well as the experience 
that comes back — is the reason why.
“Shea is playing the lights out right 
now,” Gattis said. “I was a little bit 
worried about him because he spent 

so much time on the golf course this 
summer. But his playmaking, his 
ball placement, his footwork in the 
pocket, I’ve been really pleased. He’s 
playing at a really big-time level, 
so he sets the standard. The other 
players around him can really see it.”
That’s the kind of thing you expect 
to hear about a senior quarterback 
in fall camp — all positive. Given 
that Patterson is coming off the best 
season a Michigan quarterback has 
had this side of Denard Robinson, 
and is now playing in an offense 
tailored to his skill-set, there’s no 
reason to doubt Gattis.
• At running back, the biggest 
question mark going into the year 
for the Wolverines’ offense, Gattis 
said Michigan likes all five of their 
options: Tru Wilson, Christian 
Turner, Zach Charbonnet, Hassan 
Haskins and Ben VanSumeran. 
Realistically, the battle for the 
starting job is between the first 
three, 
with 
Charbonnet, 
the 
freshman, being perhaps the most 
intriguing option.
“Zach’s maturity stood out right 

away to us, as did the way he is 
always in the weight room and the 
coach’s offices,” Gattis said. “He 
missed all of spring ball but still 
hasn’t made any mistakes in fall 
camp.”
• 
Gattis 
highlighted 
Mike 
Sainristil’s 
production 
at 
wide 
receiver, little surprise after the 
freshman 
earned 
rave 
reviews 
throughout spring ball. He also made 
sure to mention Cornelius Johnson 
in the same breath. Johnson, a 
freshman from Connecticut, has the 
kind of physicality to compete in the 
Big Ten already. However, it would 
be a surprise to see him earn real 
playing time given Michigan’s depth 
at receiver.
• Unsurprisingly, Gattis didn’t 
name a starter at right tackle, 
only praising both Jalen Mayfield 
and Andrew Stueber. Given the 
precedent 
set 
by 
Harbaugh, 
Michigan shouldn’t be expected to 
give away who the starter is before 
the Aug. 31 opener against Middle 
Tennessee State.
• Donovan Peoples-Jones has 

been practicing through a groin 
injury, though Gattis didn’t say 
whether the receiver was at 100 
percent. In the spring, Harbaugh 
said the injury could go into the 
season, so take this as a positive 
development.
“He’s been making plays and 
has dnoe a really good job kind 
oof taking it over and learning the 
details and techniquest that we 
learn at that position and applying 
them this camp,” Gattis said. “He 
missed all of that this spring, but he’s 
done a nice job catching up.”
• As for the defense, coordinator 
Don 
Brown 
said 
that 
junior 
cornerback Ambry Thomas hasn’t 
returned to practice, nor did he 
specify a timeline. The nature of 
Thomas’ injury is unclear. 
• Brown also said that senior 
defensive tackle Michael Dwumfour 
is practicing, though still working 
his way through a torn plantar fascia 
suffered last season in a win over 
Maryland. Luiji Vilain, who missed 
two full seasons with knee ailments, 
is practicing as well.

Depth in front seven allowing room for healthy competition at camp

Losing a majority of starters 
from his top-five defense, Michigan 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
stood in front of the media five days 
into training camp, reflecting upon 
how last season could have gone 
differently.
“The first 19 minutes of the 
regular season were not very good 
for the Michigan defense,” Brown 
said. “The next 10-game stretch was 
pretty damn good and then we got 19 
minutes left (in the final game), and 
it’s a 7-point game, 8-point game. 
And the last 19 minutes weren’t very 
good. If we would have just squeezed 
out the first 19 and the last 19, which 
is probably the result of the things 
we can control, it might have been a 
historic year.
“That means mentally you gotta 
be tougher, that means from a 
preparation standpoint, we gotta 
be better. That means from my 
standpoint, we have to be better. 
So, you know, that’s really the 
challenge.”
But perhaps an even greater 
challenge for Brown is figuring out a 
combination of 11 guys who can line 
up on the same side of the field and 

replicate what last year’s defense 
did.
And though he didn’t give many 
specific answers as to who the clear-
cut favorites are at each position, his 
answers did often include a plethora 
of contenders, specifically within 
the front seven. They showcased the 
most important thing any defense 
needs in order to be successful all 
season long — depth.
With the departures of Rashan 
Gary and Chase Winovich, the 
trenches lost the most star power 
of any unit on defense. Though 
pass rushers like junior Kwity Paye, 
sophomore Aidan Hutchinson and 
junior Donovan Jeter were already 
expected to step up and follow their 
predecessors’ footsteps, Brown was 
most impressed with the guys right 
behind them.
“Probably the most improved guy 
that I can speak on behalf of is Carlo 
Kemp,” Brown said. “Stronger, way 
faster, confident. Just body language 
and the whole deal, leadership, 
really playing at a high level. Ben 
Mason vastly improved, obviously 
was a former running back but we 
put him into that mix, and we feel 
good about him.”
Brown also mentioned that senior 
Michael Dwumfour is continuing to 

recover from his injury that ended 
his junior year campaign but he has 
practiced already as well, making 
that six guys who are in a position to 
win four starting roles. 
The linebacker squad suffered 
perhaps the greatest loss as middle 
linebacker and defensive anchor 
Devin Bush declared for the NFL 
Draft. And with the SAM being 
one of the weakest positions in last 
year’s defense, Brown has his hands 
full trying to figure out the best 
fits at each spot. But once again, he 
preached the depth in the middle 
unit starting with junior Josh Ross, 
going as far to say that all of his 
contending linebackers are some of 
the best in the nation. 
“It’s not a challenge to coach 
Josh Ross — he’s the brightest 
linebacker I’ve been around in a long 
time,” Brown said. “Ross, Cameron 
McGrone, (Jordan) Glasgow, Devin 
Gil, and Jordan Anthony can play a 
lot of places in this country, let me 
just tell you that… this is probably 
the most depth I’ve had. 
“Let the competition just go. Isn’t 
it a beautiful thing when we have 
five guys who can play all three 
positions? So, if you’re not playing at 
your best, sorry.”
For Brown, this philosophy won’t 

stick to just the linebacker unit, 
though. With the depth he has, it’s 
starting to become a central theme 
of fall camp.
