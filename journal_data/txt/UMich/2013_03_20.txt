Bill fines schools
that negotiate
before right to
work takes effect
By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
Daily Staff Reporter
A subcommittee in the Michi-
gan House of Representatives
proposed a new bill that could cut
funding to the University's three
campuses by about by $41 million
for the 2013-2014 academic year.
Although the bill would
increase funding for higher edu-
cation, it would penalize the
University and Wayne State Uni-
versity for negotiating contracts
prior to right-to-work legislation
passed in December 2012 and
taking effect at the end of March.
Because the University has
already reached tentative con-
tracts with nurses and lecturers,
it would fall into this penalized
category. The Graduate Employ-
ees Organization spent most of
last week negotiating with Uni-

versity officials to sign a contract
extension prior to the right-to-
work law's effective date. Mem-
bers are currently voting on
an agreement proposed by the
University on Monday after the
union left the bargaining table
late last week. The University of
Michigan Professional Nurses
Council also reached a tentative
agreement last week.
Both groups have yet to ratify
these contracts.
However, the University
would still face penalty if the bill
is passed through the legislature
because of the negotiation of the
contracts, according to Universi-
ty spokesman Rick Fitzgerald. In
order to avoid the loss, the Uni-
versity would have to prove that
these new contract negotiations
would save more than 10 percent
than the old contracts.
Fitzgerald said it's too early in
the budgeting process to deter-
mine how these cuts would affect
the University itself In the mean
time, Fitzgerald said the Univer-
sity will continue to negotiate
with unions with expiring con-
tracts. He said discussion with

Abramson reflects
on value of high-
quality journalism
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
ManagingNews Editor
Though it seems like aggre-
gate sites, gossip blogs and
social media dominate the
Internet, Jill Abramson still
thinks there's a high demand for
quality journalism.
Abramson, the executive edi-

tor at the New York Times, told a
crowd of about 200 people at the
Biomedical Science Research
Building Tuesday that, despite
popular belief, there are more
signs than not that of excellence
in journalism.
"I believe there is more
quality journalism being pro-
duced today than ever before,"
Abramson said.
The University's Center for
Education of Women invited
Abramson to speak as the 18th
Mullin Welch Lecturer. She is
the Times' first female execu-

tive editor.
The esteemed journalist came
to The New York Times in 1997
after working at several publica-
tions, including Time magazine
and The Wall Street Journal.
She served as the Times' Wash-
ington bureau chief and man-
aging editor before being
appointed to executive editor of
the New York Times.
Speaking on her 59th birth-
day, Abramson said she believes
it is her "highest calling" to
make sure that production of
quality journalism continues to

be a sustainable business prac-
tice in today's crowded, often
informal media market.
"Quality, serious journalism
that is thoroughly reported, ele-
gantly told and that truly honors
the intelligence of its readers is
the business model of the New
York Times," Abramson said.
"I believe that's why the Times
has been successful during this
challenging transition from
print to digital."
She pointed to Times reports
on Wal-Mart Mexico's practices

Findings address
in-state rates for
undocumented
residents
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
After more than a year of
holding protests in support of
in-state tuition equality for
undocumented students, the
Coalition for Tuition Equality
has submitted a report to the
University Board of Regents
detailingthe issue.
The report includes a series
of pros and cons on granting
undocumented students in-
state tuition benefits, according
to Public Policy senior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, the founder of
CTE.
University Provost Phil Han-
lon recommended assembling a
task forceto createthe report in
April 2012 in response to CTE's
previous efforts. The task force
includes Donica Varner, Uni-
versity associate general coun-
sel; Lester Monts, senior vice
provost for academic affairs;
International Center Director

John Greisberger; and three
students including Mersol-
Barg, who is currently a Daily
columnist.
Although Mersol-Barg said
he could not reveal the details
of the report until the regents
have reviewed it, he said the
task force met on a regular basis
"with a very comprehensive
approach" to research the issue
and discuss their findings. He
added that he was impressed
with how committed Univer-
sity administrators have been
in working on the issue.
In November, Mersol-Barg
and the task force traveled to
California on an University-
funded trip to discuss the steps
needed to produce a more
accessible environment for
undocumented students with
administrators from the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley,
and the University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles.
While California is one of 12
states to enact state provisions
that allow institutions of high-
er education to give benefits to
undocumented individuals, the
state of Michigan permit these
benefits and governs under a
1996 law.

An overhaul of the current edu-

students are in a generation under-
going an education revolution.
To encourage this shift, the
University's entrepreneurial
student organization MPowered
has created the EDUpreneurship
Bootcamp, a four-day event from
March 21 to 24 in which Univer-
sity students will work in teams
to create plans for education
reform in local school districts
from grades K-12.
The program is partnering

Daily Staff Reporter
He has been in office for
only a few months, but Uni-
versity Regent Mark Bernstein

might have made history when
he attended the Central Stu-

meeting Tuesday night.
"I was checking with folks

Touching upon numerous
issues including tuition costs

and state funding, Bernstein

fielding questions from repre-
sentatives.
Having been elected in

MSU sees increase in crime

Last weekend's St. Patrick's
Day festivities at Michigan State
University resulted in a drastic
increase in crime from the previ-
ous year, The State News report-
ed Tuesday.
Thin year's holiday resulted in
a greater number of police calls,
citations and arrests. After last
year's festivities resulted in a
traffic post heing pulled down,
MSU police said they increased
their patrol presence in East Lan-
sing for the holiday weekend.
Some students were surprised
by the number of arrests because
the cold weather kept more peo-
ple indoors this year. Others felt
the increase in police action was
the result not of increased crime,

but rather of greater police pres- costs to students.

Texas Christian University

To avoid the possible mis-

statistics, Texas Christian Uni-
versity has hired an internal audi-
tor to review the records, tcu3fiO
reported March 13.
Several universities across the
country have already been found
to inflate statistics to make their
schools more appealing to appli-
cants. By hiring an auditor, TCU
said it hopes to validate its admis-
sions statistics for potential appli-
cants.

Late winter storm
dumps 15 inches
of snow in U.P.
A late winter storm has
dumped as much as 15 inches of
snow on Michigan's Upper Pen-
insula, with up to 2 feet forecast
in places.
The National Weather Ser-
vice says the heaviest snowfall
has been in the northern Upper
Peninsula, with up to 15 inches
in Houghton County by Tuesday
afternoon.
In the western Upper Pen-
insula, 10 inches is reported in
Ontonagon County and 8.5 inch-

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah
Chipotle pulls
support for
Boy Scouts
Chipotle Mexican Grill has
pulled its sponsorship of Utah's
"Scout-O-Rama" because of the
Boy Scouts of America's long-
standing ban on gays.
The popular Colorado-based
restaurant chain initially signed
on to provide about $4,200
" worth of coupons to the Utah
Boy Scouts' annual event, sched-
uled for May 4 in a Salt Lake City
suburb. The Boy Scouts' Great
Salt Lake Council is one of the
largest in the country, with the
majority of troops sponsored by
Mormon churches.
Chipotle's anti-discrimination
policy states that the company
shouldn't support organizations
that exclude based on sexual ori-
entation. When company lead-
ers found out about the promise
to offer coupons, they nixed the
idea, Chipotle spokesman Chris
Arnold said.

North Dakota
considering out-
lawing abortions
North Dakota lawmakers who
approved what would be some
of the most restrictive abortion
laws in the U.S. are now consid-
ering outlawing all abortions.
The "personhood" measures
would ban abortions by defin-
ing human life as beginning
with conception. It's drawing
opposition from some doctors
who say it could cause problems
for infertile couples seeking to
use in vitro fertilization to con-
ceive, but supporters insist that's
addressed in the legislation.
The state Senate passed
two personhood measures last
month, and the House could vote
as soon as Tuesday. One of the
bills would make the proposal a
state law and another is a reso-
lution that would put the defini-
tion into the state constitution, if
passed by voters.

BAGHDAD, Iraw
65 killed in wave
of bombings
across Iraq
Insurgents sent a bloody mes-
sage on the eve of the 10th anni-
versary of the U.S.-led invasion,
carrying out a wave of bombings
across the country Tuesday that
killed at least 65 people in the
deadliest day in Iraq this year.
The nearly 20 attacks, most
of them in and around Baghdad,
demonstrated in stark terms
how dangerously divided Iraq
remains more than a year after
American troops withdrew.
More than 240 people were
reported wounded.
It was Iraq's bloodiest day
since Sept. 9, when an onslaught
of bombings and shootings killed
92.
Violence has ebbed sharply
since the peak of Sunni-Shiite
fighting that pushed the country
to the brink of civil war in 2006
and 2007. But insurgents are still
able to stage high-profile attacks,
while sectarian and ethnic rival-
ries continue to tear at the fabric
of national unity.

"There are elements of this

discussed the importance the
cost of tuition played in his
candidacy.
Bernstein said when he was
campaigning, his bus initially
had the slogan "Keep College
Affordable" painted on it. But
after someone approached him
saying college isn't affordable
now, he decided to change the
slogan.
"We took the bus into the
shop, (and) we repainted
'make college affordable,"' he
said. "That was a very strong
reminder of the challenges that
we face at this university, and,
frankly, in higher education in
general."
Bernstein emphasized that
college needs to be affordable,
especially for low-income stu-
dents.
"I'm speaking to you as
someone who feels very
strongly that we need to make
sure that this University
remains or becomes affordable
for students who can't afford
it," Bernstein said, but noted
that doing so is a complicated
process.
Bernstein said the Univer-
sity is receiving substantially
less from the state govern-

ment than other universities
despite it providing substantial
amounts of financial aid to stu-
dents.
"We're doing the most or
pretty close to the most as a
university for students while
the state is doing virtually
nothing," he said.
In the question-and-answer
segment, LSA sophomore Dan-
iel Morales, an LSA represen-
tative and one of the leaders
of the Coalition for Tuition
Equality, asked Bernstein
about his stance on tuition
equality.
"I've been outspoken in my
support for tuition equality,"
Bernstein replied. "I'm hope-
ful that we're going be able to
address this issue in a way that
resolves it satisfactorily."
Nonetheless, he was reluc-
tant to say tuition equality
would be happening anytime

Arbor) said the Republican leg-
islature is trying to "retroac-
tively punish these institutions"
for doing something completely
legal.
"There are a number of local
governments, communities and
Universities who have taken the
opportunity to push up their
negotiations with their employ-
ees, and in many cases, save mil-
lions and millions of dollars for
the taxpayers in the process,"
Irwin said. "And the Republican
legislators are trying to punish
these institutions for making
this choice because of political
ideology."

Dillingham contributed reporting.
we would like, but there has
been a great urgency regarding
this matter because every day
that passes is another day where
an undocumented student has
to forgo their dreams of a Uni-
versity of Michigan education,"
Mersol-Barg said.
In the group's most recent
protest Monday, about 60 stu-
dents gathered in front of the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing in support of tuition equality.
While the University faces
a number of legal hurdles and
complications in permitting
tuition equality, protester Javier
Contreras, a senior at Skyline
High School and an undocu-
mented student awaiting admis-
sion to the University, said he
believes their protests will
amount to progress.
"There have been times when
I feel like all the work I've been
doing isn't really worth it, but as
long as there's a small chance of
reform, you have to be optimistic
and just hope for the best"
soon. He called the University
residency requirements "byz-
antine" and in need of reform.
Morales also asked Bern-
stein about the possibility of a
student representative on the
Board of Regents. In order for
there to be a student spot on
the board, Bernstein said there
would have to be a constitu-
tional change and, therefore, it
is "highly unlikely."
Getting a student represen-
tative on the Board of Regents
is part of the platform of
forUM, a CSG political party.
Current CSG Treasurer Chris
Osborn, forUM's presiden-
tial candidate, said Bernstein
might have confused student
regent for student representa-
tive. A student representative
acts as an ex officio member of
the board and would sit in on
regent meetings without vot-
ing on issues.
"forUM is advocating for a
student representative on the
Board of Regents, not a stu-
dent Board of Regents mem-
ber," Osborn said. "That does
not require a constitutional
amendment."
In an interview after he
spoke, Bernstein emphasized
the need for regents to be vis-
ible to students.
"I can't speak for other

regents, and I know they all
care deeply about the quality
of student life and wouldn't be
doing this if they didn't care
about the well-being of stu-
dents, faculty and staff," Ber-
nstein said. "But I think it's
important to make an effort to
be engaged in student life."
CSG President Manish
Parikh said he was extremely
pleased that Bernstein - who
said he would come back "peri-
odically" to assembly meetings
- had set precedent for regents
to attend meetings.
"I think I shared the senti-
ment with all members of our
assembly and everyone in CSG
that we are all truly humbled
and honored that a regent -
Regent Bernstein - came and
spoke before us," he said. "I
think it sends out a strong sig-
nal that he truly is a students'
regent, and I hope that it will
always remain this way."

of bribing state officials and on
the hidden wealth of relatives
of Wen Jaibo, the former Chi-
nese prime minister, when he
was in office. Abramson also
noted that the Times has put a
priority on multimedia story-
telling, evidenced by Snow Fall:
The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek,
a 30,000-word piece that gar-
nered significant attention for
its one-of-a-kind interactive
experience.
Despite all the praise she had
for the Times' business model,
she stopped short of suggesting
that news outlets are perfect
these days.
Abramson acknowledged
that the Times significantly
mishandled reporting on the
Bush administration's claims
that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hus-
sein possessed weapons of mass
destruction. She said the Times
and many other news outlets
ran the administration's claims
on page one and pushed stories
expressing skepticism about the
claims to the back of the paper.
Former Washington reporter
Judith Miller caused much con-
troversy with her reporting on
WMDs, much of which was
found to be based on inaccurate
information.
Abramson also expressed con-

cern that many regional news-
papers that were previously of
high quality are being forced to
cut back. Many papers that had
foreign or domestic bureaus have
been forced to limit their content
to only local stories.
"It bothers me profoundly that
where the most has been sacri-
ficed has been at the local level,"
Abramson said, noting that it is
important that municipal and
state governments continue to
have watchdogs holding them
accountable.
Abramson also spoke about
the importance of maintaining
a diverse newsroom and cul-
tivating a female voice in the
media industry. Abramson said
the Times' masthead is about
50-percent female, its highest-
ever proportion, adding that
women make up 40 percent of
the average newsroom - a num-
ber she's looking to increase.
Concluding her speech,
Abramson encouraged students
with an interest in journalism to
follow their passion. She said the
profession is a critical part of the
nation's society.
At the event, the CEW also
awarded the Carol Hollens-
head Award to Chemistry Prof.
Carol Fierke, the Chemistry
Department's chair, and to Carol
Hutchins, head coach of the wom-
en's softball team. The award
recognizes individuals at the Uni-
versity who promote equity and

social change. Athletic Director
Dave Brandon spoke briefly at the
event to honor Hutchins, noting
her fight for gender equality for
female student-athletes through
Title IX regulations.
Kahn was filled with mostly
faculty, staff and community
members, though some students
did attend.
LSA senior Mark Chou said
he was intrigued by Abramson's
sense of responsibility to keep
quality journalism sustainable.
When asked whether he thinks
members of his generation will
be willing to pay for their news,
Chou was unsure.
"We download movies, TV
shows, and I think that's some-
thing we're going to have to
think about," Chou said. "Either
we'll change the system or the
system will have to adapt."
Chou said young adults are
too often portrayed as illiterate
media consumers, solely looking
to social media for their news.
He pointed out a failed effort to
provide free issues of the Times
to students as a way to improve
media literacy on campus.
"I think what we're reading
on the side isn't publicized, and
that's when we are reading the
New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal, but we don't talk
about that as much," Chou said.
"More could be done on our cam-
pus to get us to read more high-
quality journalism."

is also providing support.
The event will be held night-
ly from Thursday to Sunday at
various locations throughout
the School of Education and the
Business School. About 60 stu-
dents from various disciplines of
the University will compete.
On the first day, University
students will be educated on the
top 15 problems facing the edu-
cation system. Education Prof.
Donald Peurach and Alex Bow-
man, the director of community
outreach at Chalkfly - a school
supplies distribution company -
will deliver the list.
On the second day, Dale Ste-
phens, leader and founder of
the education reform program
Uncollege, will deliver the key-
note address, and student groups
will be assigned to solve each of
the 15 problems. On the third
day, students will work on their
plans with various mentors from
education and entrepreneur-

ship fields before presenting to a
panel of judges on Sunday.
The winning groups will get
the opportunity to compete for a
chance to enter into the Business
School's Dare to Dream competi-
tion, as well as an opportunity to
receive feedback and resources
from the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation.
Stephens, an education futur-
ist, said making changes in edu-
cation as early as elementary
school will have an immense
impact on making education a
more individualized pursuit.
"There are so many simple
things that can be done - from
having students write down
their learning goals to giving
them choices about how to learn
- that would make school more
self-directed," Stephens said.
Stephens also saidthekeydefi-
ciency in the current education
system is the failure to provide
students with skills that are vital
for success in the job market.
"I think the biggest problem
is that the system is designed to
prepare students for the system,

not the real world," he said. "We
go to preschool to get into kin-
dergarten to get into elementary
school and so on, (and) we hear
employers complaining that they
can't find graduates with the
right skills, yet we don't stop to
ask whether we should change
what we're teaching to make it
more marketable."
EDUpreneruship organizer
In Jae Lee, a Business and LSA
junior, said new technological
updates in education are the key
to enhancing a student's learn-
ing and the classroom environ-
ment.
"I think with more interactive
technology-I think it helps you
explore the topics you want to
explore, and more in depth," Lee
said. "(There is a) lack of innova-
tion in how we teach students.
For the past century we've had
this same style of teaching."
LSA freshman Omead Sinai,
also an EDUpreneurship orga-
nizer, said he thinks problems
such as education inequality and
freedom in schooling need to be
addressed.

Colleges, not corporations
Universitypresidents need to focus on education first
niversity presidents have some of the most prestigious posi-
tions in academia. With that comes immense responsibil-
ity and the ability to change the face of higher education.
John Sexton, president of New York University, was named one of
the "10 Best University Presidents in America" by Time magazine in
2009. However, he has recently come under fire by his own faculty
for running the school like a corporation instead of an education-
al institution. He has been accused of bypassing the faculty board
when making decisions that affect the entire academic body. Trans-
parency is a huge issue for any large-scale organization, including
our own University. University President Mary Sue Coleman is set
to leave office in 2014, and with the continued controversy over the
role of a university president, the University needs to take NYU's
situation into account when choosing its next leader.


I've heard so many times from survivors 'You're
the first person I've ever told.'Once you create a
space for people to talk, they will."
- Annie Clark, a North Carolina graduate and activist against sexual assault, said to The New York Times.
What makes the mitten?

Sexton has been an integral part of NYU's
campus expansion to Greenwich village, a
reform to which many faculty have object-
ed. More broadly, the faculty dislikes Sex-
ton's inconsideration for dissenting opinions
and unwillingness to include the faculty on
important university decisions. The prob-
lem goes beyond Sexton's lack of leadership
qualities. Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of
media, culture and communication in NYU's
Steinhardt School of Culture, said, "We see
NYU as a school; we see our mission as edu-
cational. Sexton and the trustees who sup-
port him view NYU as a bundle of assets
whose value they will apparently do anything
to maximize on paper. We believe that this
approach is destroying this university." This
problem is not unique to NYU. Universities
across the country have been accused of a
lack of transparency and a business-like men-
tality toward running their respective uni-
versities. This is a trend we should be wary
of, especially when choosing the next leader
of our school.
Communication between the University
faculty and administrators has been under
scrutiny in the past year.When expanding the
Big Ten to include the University of Maryland
and Rutgers University, University Athletic
Director Dave Brandon failed to consult the

before making his decision. Instead, he simply
informed the board of the result. This decision
affected the game schedules of student athletes
by increasing travel time, thus increasing the
strain on student athletes as they spend more
time out of the classroom. This expansion may
bolster the Big Ten's profits at the expense of
the University faculty's main goal of educating
students, athlete or otherwise.
The new president should be an essential
part of completing the University's main goal
of educational improvement. Transparency is
central to this improvement. The regents had
one fewer public meeting this year because of
a trip they took to California. They also have
a rope and security surrounding them at pub-
lic meetings, separating them from the public.
University presidents should not be insular and
be committed to academia, not corporations.
A new University president will generate
change throughout campus, good or bad. How-
ever, we need to ensure that these changes
translate into substantial educational and
administrative improvements. NYU has dem-
onstrated that there has been a shift in higher
education goals that resemble those of a profit-
maximizing company. Our future president,
and presidents at all universities, should focus
on educating students.

often teach an essay called
"Michigan." In it, Mohammed
Naseehu Ali details his journey
from Ghana to
Michigan to
attend Inter-
lochen Center
for the Arts.
Duringthe long
winter months,
he sharpens his
outsider's eye to JOSEPH
identifythree
types of Michi- HORTON
ganders: "...there
is the Poet, who
spends lots of time observingnature
and writing about it; the outdoors
man, men and/or women who
engage the elements through skiing,
ice-fishing, and hunting through
the sullen months of winter; and the
Sports Fanatic, the ordinary Michi-
gander who passes endless hours
watching sports on television." My
classrooms full of students - both
native to the state and new - are
quick to say there's more to the Mit-
ten. Plenty more, they say. But when
talk turns to what Michigan actu-
ally is and to defining what being
a Michigander actually means, the
classroom splits - alliances form,
tempers flare, claims are staked,
and authority and credibility are
invoked to the breaking point.
For the outsiders, summarized in
broad terms, Michigan is distilled
into a parade of opposites. The state
becomes a contrarian collection
of everything left behind at home.
Californians point out the "con-
stant" gray, "absolutely freezing"
temperatures and the delightfully
empty highways - no, no, they're
"freeways," you know. East Coasters
note, en masse, on how polite and
"nice" everyone is, and Southerners
wonder why everyone is so reserved.
International students - a category
so broad as to be often unusable -
do regularly share common ground
in comparing their home cuisines
to Michigan's big-portioned, less-
flavorful attempts at replication.
For most of the newly arrived, an
appreciation of Mitten geography
the
podium

and culture is passing and general:
Canada's close, Detroit's a disas-
ter and there are a ton of big lakes
around. Not only have many never
been to the Upper Peninsula, but
also a not-insignificant number have
no idea that Michigan even has an
upper peninsula - and just forget
pronouncing "Mackinac."
Natives and long-timers, then,
frequently find themselves left to
defend or dismantle Michigan's
stereotypes, and I've found this
at first produces surprising una-
nimity. Yes, they say, we do point
to where we're from on our hand,
but only in response to the blank,
"you're-from-where?" stare. No, not
everyone owns a boat, but everyone
knows somebody who owns a boat.
Yes, we have plenty of great lakes,
and we can name at least four with-
out an acronym. Sports are a major
unifying component of Mitten life,
and yes, part of beinga Tigers fan is
appreciating (if not secretly enjoy-
ing) suffering, but fandom is frac-
turing too: the Michigan-Michigan
State rivalry seeps into all facets of
life, from high-school graduation
cliques to families divided blue and
green over generations with neither
side giving ground. Yes, we have
two peninsulas, and of course the
Upper Peninsula is weird, but it's
our weird, so back off.
But there is one issue that vexes
the Michiganders. As this schizo-
phrenic Michigan March drags on
in its cruel game of bait-and-switch
and guardedly optimistic conversa-
tions inch toward cabins and cottag-
es and trips "up north," the question
is collectivelybegged: Where, exact-
ly, is "up north?" Past Midland, some
say. Or Mount Pleasant. Just any-
thing above the thumb, insist oth-
ers; if you draw a line flat across the
end of the thumb, that's north. Some
draw a higher line - Traverse City
or Gaylord or.Grayling and above. A
few even venture that north really
means above the bridge only. No
agreement. No compromise.
Consider, then, that our Univer-
sity not only serves its state but also
serves to introduce a huge num-

ber of outsiders to the state. What
responsibility do native and long-
time Michiganders have here in
shouldering Mitten identity? What
introduction should natives offer the
new, and whatgood is that introduc-
tion if basic geography, "the north,"
is so divisive and variable?
I thought Faygo
was a cleaning
solution.
I'm not in a position to say, since
I'm an outsider. I'm from Colorado,
which on the Michigander radar
generally appears as a single giant
mountain rearing up in the Far West
populated solely by Bronco-jersey-
wearing, John-Denver-humming
skiers with Coors beer-helmets and
handfuls of GORP. Before moving
here four years ago, I'd never heard
of a powder puff game or Sweetest
Day. I thought Faygo was a cleaning
solution (and, really, isn't it?) and a
"Michigan turn" was the acquired
patience of driving forever in a one-
way wrong direction.
But as a teacher of writing, I
believe that process is as valuable as
the product. For me, the truth that
"up north" is a state of mind - the
enduring definition, offered up by a
student semesters ago, is the won-
derfully simple, "'up north' is where
your cabin is; 'up north' is where
you go" - suggests a private space
in a public conversation, a place
bounded by tradition yet boundless
in idea, that helps me better appre-
ciate Michigan. Here, understand-
ing can't always be found on a map,
but you'll know it when you're there.
Or, as a good Michigander friend
of mine says, invoking his grandfa-
ther, "Michigan's adestinationstate.
There's no reason to be here besides
being here."

As two seniors, we couldn't help but be
disappointed at the announcement of Dick
Costolo as the 2013 Spring Commencement
speaker. Sure, he's the chief executive offi-
cer of one of the most monumental social
movements of our time and a 1985 University
alum. There's no doubt that Costolo has all
the qualifications necessary to make a mean-
ingful and memorable address, one we will
undoubtedly enjoy and remember. But Costo-
lo represents yet another layer of a disturbing
pattern in commencement speakers.
In the past 24 years, 71 percent of spring
commencement speakers have been male.
In the past 10 years, only two speakers were
female: Jennifer Granholm (as part of the tra-
dition of the Michigan governor speaking),
and Christiane Amanpour. But what's most
disturbing is the fact that in the past 24 years,
out of the seven total women who have spo-
ken, only one - Antonia Novello who spoke in
1994 was an alum. This sends the message
that even though women have been admit-
ted to the University since 1870, almost none
are accomplished enough to serve as a com-
mencement speaker.
A commencement speaker not only serves
as a role model and a purveyor of the Uni-
versity's missions and values, but also offers
inspiration to students as they step into the
world. For women and men heading into their

careers, a female speaker demonstrates that
women can - and do - succeed in leadership
and offer alternate perspectives.
We're frustrated that the selection com-
mittee has seemed to overlook so many great
female candidates in the past decades - there
is certainly no lack of impressive women.
For example, Alexa Canady, a 1971 gradu-
ate, is the former chief of neurosurgery at
the Children's Hospital of Michigan and the
first African-American woman to become a
neurosurgeon. Melinda Gates is co-chair of
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - the
largest private foundation and an instrumen-
tal organization in initiating global public
health interventions. Or, perhaps in keeping
with this year's business theme, there's Ursu-
la Burns, the chief executive at Xerox and
the first African-American woman to head a
Fortune 500 company. There's also the for-
midable Barbara Walters, an American icon
since the 1970s.
This list, impressive as it is, only scratch-
es the surface of available female leaders to
inspire graduates of the University. Is it truly
that difficult to find a female commencement
speaker who demonstrates women - not just
men - can be the leaders and the best?

Lifelong commitment, not an end goal

In Jennifer Xu's column on
Monday ("Weighing in on Diets,"
3/18/13) she recommends funding
for research on a Japanese canker
sore drug that has been shown to
increase weight loss in mice. She
endorses trying to see if the drug
could help humans combat the obe-
sity epidemic sweeping the nation.
While there's scientific proof
backing up Xu's claims, I'm still
very skeptical of any drug pro-
duced to stimulate weight loss.
Maybe it comes from the thou-
sands of infomercials that feature
before and after pictures and a too
tanned, too toned muscle-head
saying, "And you don't have to
change your diet at all!" Quite sim-
ply, I don't believe it.
More importantly, a magic pill,
if it does exist, won't cure the real
problem that has led to a massively
overweight American population.
Fast food, large portions and a
sedentary lifestyle have been pro-
grammed into our culture and don't
seem to be leaving any time soon.
Super Big Gulps, Supersized
French fries, and the Treinte size
at Starbucks are all examples of
obscenely large and high-caloric

items that have become a normal
part of our meals at least once a
week. Does anyone really need a
40-ounce soda?
The food culture of our society
doesn't just affect those who are
extremely overweight. A skinny
person isn't synonymous with a
healthy one. Obesity isn't the only
problem: Some of the skinniest
people have the worst eating hab-
its. Weight loss isn't the only indi-
cator of a healthy lifestyle. Muscle
weighs more than fat, therefore
muscle mass is a better indicator of
health than relative weight.
As a person who has struggled to
lose and maintain her weight since
puberty, eating well and exercising
have become a part of my lifestyle
rather than interim measures to
lose 10 pounds.
I don't "diet" - not in short
bursts, anyway. I eat well and com-
pensate for less healthy days with
healthier ones later in the week.
I exercise because I feel stressed
without it, and I make it fun with
kickboxing and kettle bell classes.
Xu is right. It's hard to change
what our bodies consider the norm,
our "set point" as she calls it. How-

ever, just because eating right and
exercising are hard doesn't mean
they aren't worth doing. And
they're probably healthier than
injecting chemicals into our bodies.
Secondly, your body seems bounces
around that "set point" by five or six
pounds every month. It's exhaust-
ing to keep track of every half-
pound gained or lost. Instead, finda
weight that makes you feel good in
your clothes, gives you energy and
isn't impossible to maintain - even
if that's a few pounds heavier than
what you would like.
A magic pill - even if it's scien-
tifically proven to help cut weight -
won't improve the way people look
at being healthy (a lifelong com-
mitment rather than an end goal).
Healthy shouldn't be about a goal
weight or fitting into a prom dress
or being "bikini ready." These are
the short-term objectives that can
lead to bulimia, anorexia and other
eating disorders.
Everyone longs for the day when
we can take a pill and become a size
two, but it's very unlikely that this
will make us any healthier.

said, "because it does add an extra

and Florentine Films are as busy as

a documentary about the Viet-
nam War set for 2016. As for how
Florentine Films will approach
documentingthesethree historical
events, Burns said, "You can believe
that race is an integral part."
Burns has also been in dis-
cussion with HBO through Tom
Hanks's company Playtone to
produce a dramatic series about
the life of the boxer Jack Johnson,
which, after the success of the 2005
documentary, Burns sees as "ripe
for dramatic treatment."
Concerninghis role inthe actual

Bringing TV back to life
with fan-funded projects

By KELLY ETZ
DailyArts Writer
TV fandom has hit an all-time
high. Eloquently exemplified by
the superfan who pledged $10,000
to the we're-pretty-sure-it's-real-
ly-happening "Veronica Mars"
movie, series cancellation isn't a
death sentence anymore: It's an
opportunity.
Far from the days of sending
angry, passionate letters (or bot-
tles of Tabasco sauce) in an effort
to reinvigorate weary produc-
ers of cult-status series, the new
reality might only require dip-
ping into your wallet. It certainly
worked for Rob Thomas, creator
of "Veronica Mars," who launched
a Kickstarter campaign to (partly)
fund a six-years-in-the-making
movie.
Twelve hours later, the proj-
ect reached its goal of $2 million.
With 24 days left, over $3 million
has been pledged, from as little as
a dollar to the whopping $10,000
someone pledged for a speaking
role in the film. What seemed like
a crazy pipe dream destined to
die on thousands of Internet mes-
sage boards is now within reach.
Which begs the question: How far
can we take this?
With the possibility open, will
other gone-too-soon series clamor
for their own kickstarted dreams?
Some have already succeeded
without asking fans to shell out
half the proceeds - series like
"Community," "Arrested Develop-
ment" and "Family Guy" have all
managed to drag themselves out of
the coffin and back into the spot-
light. It's a different story when
attempting to make the leap to the
silver screen, but "Veronica Mars"

Powerful." Though Kunis has
been on a press junket for the past
few weeks, I think she'll remem-
ber this interview in particular
- after all, it has amassed closetos
11-million views injusttwo weeks.
Chris Stark, the first-time
interviewer, was vocal about his
extreme anxiety from the begin-
ning. After one question about
the film, he digressed, detail-
ing his and his buddies' favorite
drinks and nighttime hangouts.
Though his bosses were clearly
not impressed, Kunis was having
what she called the best inter-
view she'd had all day.
The interview, which might
be a bump in the road for Stark's
early career, has done wonders
for Kunis, who came off as incred-
ibly funny and down to earth. At
one point, the top comment for
the video on YouTube is "such
an awesome chick." Other com-
ments range from "Mila Kunis is
the best" to "bestninterview ever!"
When celebrities embark on
weeks-long promotional tours,
what's most important is that
they come off as likeable and
human - so that we can watch
them and say, "Hey! You're just
like the rest of us!" And what's
more "regular" than Kunis enjoy-
ing a cold Blue Moon, fried chick-
en, soccer and a few Jgerbombs
every now and then?
Kunis's "Oz" interview hasB
propelled her to the top tier
of celebrity interviewees. By
avoiding the same wrought and
boring questions, these actors
are able to connect much bet-
ter with audiences and emit a
down-to-earth energy that's
necessary to sell yourself and
your film.
Nobody has done this bet-
ter than Jennifer Lawrence,
the ultra-likeable "Silver Lin-
ings Playbook" Oscar winner.
Lawrence succeeds because she
never takes herself too serious-
ly. She's able to laugh at herself,
even after tripping on her walk
up to accept the award for Best
Actress.
Mila Kunis's "Oz" interview
is essentially Lawrence's post-
Oscars press video, which is
currently at over five million
views. Much like Kunis, Law-
rence laughs off the boring,
seemingly necessary questions.
"What was your process this
morning?" asks one reporter, to
which Lawrence replies, "What
was my process? I don't know, I
just woke up ... I took a shower
I got my hair and makeup
done, and then (with a mocking
tone) I came to the Oscars." She
then apologizes and blames her
behavior on the shot she took
before coming out.
This is precisely how fellow
Oscar winner Anne Hathaway
has failed. Whereas Lawrence
isn't concerned at all about
being politically correct or if
people will like her, Hathaway
is too conscious of how people

Queen B tells you
all to 'Bow Down'

Tinder highlights

Beloved Beyonce
can do more than
just sing
By RAY MALO
Daily Arts Writer
Beyonce the performer has
had a hell of a few months. She
ripped through halftime at the
Super Bowl, riding a wave of
Destiny's Child and solo jams
that half the country didn't even
realize were bona fide classics
until they, too, were singing
along. Then, in her HBO docu-
mentary, she reminded us how
ferocious her choreographed
award show performances have
been, especially the highly styl-
ized Billboard performance of
"Who Run the World (Girls)." It
wasn't entirely obvious for a few
years there, sifting through the
Gagas and RiRis and Katys, but
it's now a certainty that Beyonc6
is the most important female
singer in the world. It makes
sense, given the competition. As
much as I like the music those
other women have made, they're
all pretty sub-par singers. Glad
we sorted that out.
And so, it's appropriate that
B's first new material of the year
isn't just a rehash of her previous
melisma marathons, say, "Love
on Top," or "Halo." She doesn't
need to prove to anyone that
she can flat-out sing (I ain't even
lookin' at you, National Anthem
sensationalists). There's noth-
ing sugary about "Bow Down/I
Been On." She does a little sing-
ing, sure, and she sounds fantas-
tic as usual. But from the first
instance she commands her lis-
teners to "bow down, bitches,"
we can hear her turn a corner.
Queen B has always had a little
stank in her voice, especially
when live and supported by
backing tracks, but that line is
straight nasty.

By CARLINA DUAN
Daily Community Culture Editor
"So, Tinder ... is that all the rage
on college campuses these days?"
Across the table, my profes-
sor and his colleague gaze at me
intently. I'm puncturing moz-
zarella balls with a plastic fork,
surrounded by middle-aged,
wine-sipping writers at a confer-
ence in Boston. I stare into my
champagne cup of water. Gesture
towards the air with my hands.
"Well," I say, "I mean ... It's treat-
ed sarcastically. Nobody takes
Tinder seriously."
On later thought, though, is
Tinder viewed as a joke at univer-
sities? Or is it just me? After all,
on a campus as huge as the Uni-
versity's, speed dating - whether
in person or online - seems to
be gaining momentum. And the
fact that I was even asked such
a question could mean the app is
peeling off its obscurity.
When my friend showed me
the Tinder app on her iPhone
last month, my immediate reac-
tion was disgust.
Tinder, self-described as "a
fun way to break the ice," is an
online mobile dating service,
used to connect one with poten-
tial partners. On the official Tin-
der website, the app lauds itself
as an "all anonymous" process,
"until someone you like, likes
you back." Think of it as a digital
Matchmaker of some sorts, only
instead of qualifying your date
through shared interest, Tin-
der brings together those with
mutual physical attraction.
But it's not completely anony-
mous. Various facts - such as
your first name, your relative
geographic location - are given.
By linking up one's Facebook
account to Tinder, people scroll
through the Facebook profile
pictures of other Tinder users
located nearby. Beneath each
picture is a "heart" button and
an "X" button. Click the "heart"
if you're looking at a hottie;
"X" out that person, if not. If
both users click "hearts" for
one another, Tinder will enable
the two to chat within the App.

Dissecting Camrons
whimsical wordplay

Maybe I'm unduly pessimistic
about this. Maybe rival stream-
ing services, like upcoming prod-
ucts from Google and Apple, will
prevent Spotify from attaining a
pseudo-monopoly. Maybe record
labels will flex their muscles and
continue to demand high royal-
ties and licensing costs anyway.
Hell, maybe Spotify will decide
to pay more per play!
Still, I'm not totally con-
vinced. Streaming unlimited
music on your phone, laptop,
tablet, etc. is the future of music
technology, and Spotify is lead-
ing the charge - much like
Apple did for phones and MP3
players. Joe Kennedy, the CEO
of Spotify's chief rival and pre-
decessor, Pandora, unexpect-
edly resigned last week despite
reasonable profits. Apple and
Google will soon release their
own streaming services, but
people are already internalizing
Spotify; the new products would
have to be undeniably better and
distinct, in the way few phones
have challenged the iPhone, for
them to truly dethrone Spotify.
And if no rival seriously com-
petes with Spotify, who can we
reasonably expect to stop its
total control of how we access
and purchase music?
The problem with Spoify's
ambition is that it threatens
to destroy the very industry it
intends to save. The worry lin-
gers that, by revolutionizing
the music business model, Spo-
tify will forsake artists' hard-
earned revenues in pursuit of
its own. While it probably won't
completely eradicate the physi-
cal media market, it likely will
crowd out other digital plat-
forms - which already make
up the majority of music sales.
At 1/140 of the already parceled
payout, though, that's a problem.
Look, I'm not trying to be a
hypocrite. I'm admittedly guilty
of both occasionally using Spo-
tify - for free, I confess - and,
ahem, downloading albums
from file-sharing websites. But if
I really love an album, especially
from one of my favorite bands,
I'll go out and buy it as soon as
possible. If I listen to an album
once and hate it, I'll likely not
listen again. The beauty of Spo-
tify is, by the unlimited access it
grants, bands will still get paid
for that one disdainful listen.
It lets you decide for yourself if
an album is worth your money
and pays artists either way. My
worry is that, if Spotify Premi-
um dominates in the ways I've
outlined, the convenience of
plugging a phone into a speaker
system to listen to an album
will quell the urge to go out and
spend the extra 10 bucks, espe-
cially when you're already pay-
ing to listen to the album ad-free
on your phone. And if that hap-
pens, extremely talented but rel-
atively unknown musicians will
be left in the dust.
People might not stop making
music, but a Spotify-dominated
music world seems, to me, to
ditch the genre-based distinc-
tion and instead casts artists
into two camps: those who make
money, and those who don't.
And that, quite frankly, is unac-
ceptable.

In 1998, Cam'ron stomped into
the hip-hop world with his debut
Confessions of Fire. Showcasing
hard-hitting East Coast produc-
tion and Cam's trademark whim-
sical wordplay, the album remains
as seminal New York rap music.
To honor his 15 years in the game,
I've pulled out a few of my favor-
ite Cam'ron lyrics (out of literally
hundreds), which blend the most
bizarre things together in a way
that only Cam can. Part kinder-
gartener and part genius, I give
you the one and only Cam'ron.
"I don't care ifyou'reJapanese,
Lebanese, Chinese, Siamesejust
befrom the seven seas" ("Wet
Wipes")
Cam'ron doesn't discrimi-
nate with his women: As long as
they're fine, he pays no attention
to where they're from. I'm just
curious; how on earth did Cam
come up with this assortment of
ethnicities? I understand how you
can relate Japan and China, and
even though Siam no longer exists
as a country, it still falls under
Asia - but Lebanon? When has
Cam'ron visited Lebanon? Fur-
thermore, the seven seas? When
do you ever hear that used outside
of Victorian-era pirate folklore?
"You'llfind them out ofstate/near
a lake, some billy bait/gettin'ate
by apes, deers/ business snakes"
("Hot Mess")
Where to start on this one?
Not only will Cam's haters be
taken out of the state, they will
be thrown out somewhere near
a lake, where, presumably, some
hillbillies will attack them. OK,
that makes some sense. But where
the hell does getting eaten by apes
and deer(s) come in? First off -
the plural of deer is deer. But most
importantly,inwhatgod-forsaken
ecosystem are apes and deer liv-
ing in harmony, feasting together?
Finally, "business snakes"just ties
this whole "Hot Mess" together.

Gardner, pro trash talker

MEN'S BASKETBALL
For 'M,' another low
seed awaits in March

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
In between workouts and
practice, redshirt junior Devin
Gardner studies professional
quarterbacks. He sends periodic
text messages to Michigan offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges about
reads. He watches film on each
practice. Twice. Yet the new face
of Michigan football says there is
one bigdifference from lastyear:
he's not so tired anymore.
And why not? Gone, finally, is
the positional confusion - is he a
quarterback? Receiver? Both? In
2012, as Michigan coach Brady
Hoke put it, Gardner "was torn
between being a wide receiver
and a quarterback."
Now, Gardner enters spring
practices as the presumptive
starter at quarterback. And so,
after a year of Gardner being
inside his own head, he's finally
where he's most comfortable:
inside others' heads.
"He's really good at getting
in people's heads," said Gard-
ner's teammate, fifth-year senior
Taylor Lewan. "If you get called
out by a quarterback, your start-
ing quarterback right now, that's
kind of a kick in the ass."
Hoke says that on the field,
Gardner is more confident in
the pocket, that he sees the field
more quickly. But Gardner's big-
gest change this offseason might
be his maturity. Gardner says
he watches film on NFL quar-
terbacks like Colin Kaepernick
to improve his play, but he also
studies Tom Brady, Russell Wil-
son and Peyton Manning to learn
how to be a better leader.
Gardner has emerged with his
sense of humor intact, but now,
it has a purpose. When Gardner
sees a player make a mistake, he
says he'll pull him aside to cor-
rect so he doesn't embarrass the
player. But Gardner is also quick
with a taunt - anything to moti-
vate.
"He's a professional trash

ERINKIRKLAND/Daily
Redshirt junior quarterback Devin Gardner is trying to be both a professional quarterback and professional trash talker.

talker," said fifth-year senior
safety Thomas Gordon. "He
knows how to get to your nerves
and he knows what gets you mad.
"You always got tobe on your
p's and q's."
Gordon, for example, often
gets text messages from Gard-
ner, who taunts the 5-foot-11
safety for his height. On Tues-
day, Gardner took a photo with
Gordon and afterward, remind-
ed him that "he's really, really
short," Gardner said. In practice,
Gardner threw jump balls to
6-foot-5 sophomore tight end
Devin Funchess, challenging
Gordon to stop it.
Gordonsaid that Gardner "can
pick you apart," but his team-
mates say they have responded
both to Gardner's talent as well
as his prodding.
"He's done a great job of using
his personality and his humor to
lead this team and do different
things," Lewan said.
CHAMPS OF THE EAST?
Michigan will always declare
itself the champion of the West,
but according to a report from
ESPN.com, that soon might be
an anachronism.
Adam Rittenberg reported
Tuesday that the Big Ten plans
to realign its divisions accord-
ing to geography, with Michi-

gan joining rivals Ohio State and
Michigan State in the East. The
changes will take effect in 2014,
when Maryland and Rutgers join
the conference.
According to the report, "bar-
ring a late shift in the discus-
sions between athletic directors
and league officials," the eastern
division will comprise Michigan,
Maryland, Michigan State, Ohio
State, Penn State and Rutgers.
Officials have yet to assign Pur-
due and Indiana to a conference.
There has been no word on
the fate of the oft-ridiculed cur-
rent division names, "Legends"
and "Leaders." The distinctly
polarizing names highlighted
an initial divisional alignment
that eschewed a traditional geo-
graphical split seen in most other
conferences in favor of competi-
tive balance.
In the new format, the east
dominates the west in both his-
torical and present-day terms.
Schools in the East, which
include soon-to-be newcom-
ers Rutgers and Maryland, have
combined for84 Big Ten champi-
onships (includingshared titles).
Western schools claim just 66.
Last year, Eastern teams went
a combined 44-27, compared to a
record of 40-38 for the West. The
Western division - which com-

prises Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Northwestern and
Wisconsin - does own the past
three Big Ten titles, all of which
belong to the Badgers.,
The realignment means
Michigan and Ohio State will
meet just once, barring a meet-
ing in the future national playoff.
Under the current alignment,
which has Michigan and Ohio
State in separate divisions, the
schools could theoretically meet
in the Big Ten Championship
game for the second consecutive
week after playing the tradition-
al rivalry game in the last week
of the regular season.
IF THE BRACE FITZ: Tail-
back Fitzgerald Toussaint took
part in limited drills during
practice Tuesday, which was
the first full-pads practice of
the spring. The fifth-year wore
a brace on his leg and was in full
gear, but he didn't participate in
contract drills.
Toussaint suffered a grue-
some injury to his left leg Nov. 17
against Iowa. Since then, Tous-
saint's recovery has progressed
faster than expected.
Hoke said that running backs
coach Fred Jackson "has dif-
ferent drills, cutting drills and
those kinds of things" for Tous-
saint.

As a No. 4 seed and co-Big Ten
champion last year, the Michi-
gan men's basketball team had
its sights set on bigger and better
things than a loss in its first NCAA
Tournament game. Standing in
its way, though, was Ohio, and
instead, it was the 13th-seeded
Bobcats who dashed to the Sweet
Sixteen before dropping a closely
contested game to North Carolina
in the regional semifinal.
The Wolverines' first-round
opponent this year, South Dakota
State, shares several commonali-
ties with Ohio. Both teams - each
No. 13 seeds - entered the Big
Dance riding win streaks after
winning their conference tourna-
ments, and each features a talent-
ed veteran point guard.
Hoping not to repeat its fate
from the previous year, several
Michigan players that were on
last year's team openly admitted
they'd use the upset as a teaching
tool, showing that anyone can be
beat in the tournament.
"Definitely, I'll bring that up
because as a freshman, or any
player, it's March - March Mad-
ness," said sophomore point guard
Trey Burke. "It's hard to not look
at the bracket and see where you
would be if you were to play in
the Elite Eight, or who you could
potentially play in the Sweet Six-
teen. It's hard (not) to do that, so
it's my job as a captain ... to con-
tinue to tell them that we've got to
take each game by each game and
not look ahead."
As a leader, Burke said that the
team will "definitely hear my voice
and just my opinion about how
we should approach this game."
Burke referred to last year's loss as
a "trap game," and that he'll make
sure Michigan doesn't get off to
another slow start like last year.
Both junior guard Tim Hard-

away Jr. and redshirt junior for-
ward Jordan Morgan also said
they'd make sure everyone, espe-
cially the team's five freshmen,
don't forget about the Ohio game,
but Morgan was also quick to point
out that the freshmen have had
experience this year losing games
the team shouldn't lose. Though
he didn't specify which games he
was referring to, the loss at previ-
ously winless Penn State certainly
comes to mind.
"This is really a different team
(than last year's)," Morgan said.
"We lost some close games (this
year), games that we didn't think
we could lose, games in ways we
wished we hadn't lost. You can't
take anyone lightly, and I think
this team has done a good job at
teachingus that."
Michigan coach John Beilein
thought his team had turned
"stale" by late Friday afternoon
when the Wolverines faced off
against Ohio in Nashville, Tenn.
last March. And when Michigan
opened the game by missing open
layups and easy jump shots allow-
ing the Bobcats to jump out to an
early lead, the coach admitted that
his team "played not to lose."
"We're doingeverything we can
to make sure we go in there and
play to win," Beilein said.
Still, Beilein cautioned, he can't
overplay last year's loss, and while
he certainly acknowledged an
urgency the team must play with,
there's a fine line he must walk.
"I think you've got to be care-
ful there," Beilein said. "We have
to make sure we go after this with
everything we can ... but you can't
go in with this attitude where,
'We're going to go home if we don't
win. '"
NOTE: Burke was named the
National Player of the Year by
Sports Illustrated on Tuesday,
becoming the first Wolverine to
earn that distinction since Cazzie
Russell did it in 1966.

ICE HOCKEY
Lying on ice, Michigan's mindset changes

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
You can't teach sacrifice in
:hockey.
It's nearly impossible to show
a method practical for sacrificing
'the body, but it can be manifested
'when a team blocks shots.
In the Michigan hockey team's
practice on Tuesday, Michigan
coach Red Berenson stood by
'his forwards on the ice, feeding
pucks to a lone defenseman act-
ing as a shooter. He provoked the
forwards to get down on a knee,
forcing the shooter to change the
angle of his shot.
The 73-year-old coach skated
up and demonstrated how to hold
the stick and what angle to take.
The drill, simplistic and practical,
is one by which the Wolverines are
learningthe concept of sacrificing.
But all of the aspects Michigan
is dominating on the stat sheet

during it's eight-game unbeaten
streak - scoring more than four
goals per game, allowing two and
killing off all but two penalties in
eight games - they haven't domi-
nated the number of blocked shots.
"I think we could do a better job
of blocking shots," Berenson said.
"Our team, still, is not a strong
shot-blocking team. We have play-
ers that are doing good jobs in
games, but it's not enough - it's a
work in progress."
The Wolverines blocked more
shots than Western Michigan just
once this weekend in their sweep
- the firsttime they have finished
with more blocks in a conference
tournamentgame.
Even on the season, Michigan
has-blocked 474 shots, while its
opponents have combined for 571
blocks.
But the evidence isn't in the
number of shots blocked, and the
defense doesn't necessarily agree

with their coach. The number of
goals allowed has decreased since
the Wolverines traveled to Colum-
bus, and most importantly, started
winning.
"I think one thing we've really
been good at lately is just limiting
their shots in general," said junior
defenseman Mac Bennett, who
has 36 blocked shots this season.
"Getting in front of pucks is huge
because that means they're not
gettingto the net.
"It means that guys are will-
ing to sacrifice their body for the
team."
The score sheet doesn't keep
track of how many shots are
altered, but it does keep track of
how many shots are taken.
Against its two CCHA playoff
opponents, Northern Michigan
and Western Michigan, Michigan
has allowed no more than 28 shots
in a game. The Wolverines held
the Broncos to just 18 shots in Fri-

day's first game of their sweep.
The Wolverines were sparing
their bodies to force awkward
shots from the outside. It's a men-
tality that lacked earlier in the
season and the sacrifices made the
difference in the weekend sweep
of Western Michigan.
Midway through the second
period of Saturday night's 5-1 win
in the CCHA quarterfinal, the
Broncos attempted their come-
back by pressuring Michigan into

its zone.
But as Western Michigan
wound up and fired shot after shot,
there was sophomore forward
Andrew Sinelli dropping down
on one knee, lowering his stick to
block a slapshot from the blue line.
Junior forward Derek DeBlois lay
on his stomach to block a shot, and
junior defenseman Jon Merrill
skated between the net and the
incoming puck.
"They're playing great," said

freshman goaltender Steve Racine
of the defense. "They're sacrific-
ing their bodies, doing whatever
to prevent goals and help me out."
Added Bennett: "It's playoffs,
so every game counts. You can't
afford to take a night off. We have
to come to play and have to be
ready to win."
For a team as desperate as the
Wolverines, it might not be neces-
sary to teach sacrifice. It's instinc-
tive.

The solitude games

Really, the key here is education, not necessarily prevention.
I think the article pointed this out pretty well (without actual-
ly saying it). This abuse is going to happen and it's going to go
mostly undetected, so college students need to know the actu-
al risks. It just so happens that usually they aren't that great:
heart palpitations, loss of appetite, disturbed sleep - sounds
like a day in the life of a sober student. The real consequences
come when stimulants like adderall are combined with alcohol
or antidepressants. Serotonin Syndrome is very real, and very
very unpleasant.

I flew backwards, smacking to the ground,

thought.
Just as I rose back to my feet, it appeared.

The furry, gopher-like creature sat there

seemed to be twenty minutes, the longest

flinched - I won. Within seconds, it disap-

Asa final rite of passage out of high school,
my school offers a three-week-long back-
packing trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountains
in California. Each senior class views this
trip as an obligatory tradition. Placed at the
end of May, it's the last activity we have as a
class before graduation.
Divided into groups of eight to 10 students
with two instructors, we hiked nearly 80
miles throughout the mountains with back-
packs filled to the brim.
Months before the trip, I daydreamed
about what might happen. Bear attacks, mos-
quito bites, fatigue, coldness and insomnia
filled my mind. (OK, well the probability of a
bear actually attacking me was little to none,
but the other options were actually quite
possible.)
I shook off the fears almost immediately
when I remembered that my older sister went
on the trip. If my girly-girl, sister - known
for her singing and dancing - could survive,
so could I.
That's when I realized I forgot the most
nerve-wracking, possibly traumatizing part
of the trip: the mandatory four-day-longasolo.
We sat in a circle around our licked-dry
pots and pans the night before we would
depart on our solos. Day 14. Thus far, the trip
had been incredible; I grew extremely close
with the others and adapted pretty easily to
a life without cellphones, wireless Internet,
showers and the other luxuries of civiliza-
tion.
"We will be separating each of you into
your quadrants tomorrow morning," Kenzie,
one of my instructors, told us. "By the looks
of it, none of you will be able to see or hear
each other."
That's when the overwhelming indubi-
table grasp of loneliness hit me. Four days.
Three nights. No communication. I felt like I

was headed for an insane asylum.
Solitude. Interminable, copious amounts
of solitude.
A solitude thatcan't be fixed with the buzz
of a cellphone or the clacking taps of a key-
board. A journal, a pen and my mind were the
only activities I had to keep me company for
four days.
It was easy the first fewhours. I drew flow-
ers, wrote about our trip so far and explored
my quadrant. Rocks, a tree and a gently slop-
ing hill constituted my home for the next few
days - I might as well make myself comfort-
able. Then night hit.
Without a watch, I used the sun's cues
to determine my bedtime. The sky slowly

the trees at an open meadow. With a closer
look, I saw a family of deer grazing the fields.
After staring at them for a few minutes, I
began to write.
Writing in a journal seemed tocome natu-
rally. I don't usually keep a journal at home
but the freedom of expression associated
with it enticed me. I wrote endlessly, detail-
ing the important moments of my senior year
(even shamelessly detailing the latest gossip
and my love life). I then drew a large Block
'M' horizontally across one page with my
blue pen. The 'M' was so large it took nearly
20 minutes to shade in. With each stroke of
my pen, my excitement for my future at the
University grew.
I closed my journal. The sun sat directly

next day. I found myself in tears at the end
of each letter I wrote. Not sad tears, but ones
induced by a sense of bewilderment: I would
be living over 2,000 miles away from these
people by the end of the summer. w
Solitude. Interminable, copious amounts
of solitude. In that moment, I heard the mar-
mot for the first time.
Loneliness has always been my great-
est fear. My life-long friend Madelyn would
always laugh as I asked her to walk with me
to our cafeteria to get a snack or walk with
me to the bathroom. I quivered at the idea of
going anywhere alone.
I laid on the rock during my last day on
solo. Gazing up at the cloudless sky, my com-
panions were the dirt, the birds in the trees ,
above me, the marmot that appeared for an
hour each day and my thoughts. My memory
and reflection served as my greatest form
of entertainment and, at this point, I didn't
mind.
I didn't let go of my fear of solitude. I
instead relished in it; I thrived in it. My com-
plete separation from human contact, in both
personal and technological forms, granted
me my freedom.
A few days alone in the wilderness
changed me. The feeling of solitude, mysti-
fying bewilderment and a surprisingly lack
of boredom presented the key to my future
well-being. If I could survive alone in the
middle of a forest, I sure as hell could survive
as the only representative of my high school
class in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
With the memories cemented in my mind,
the blue ink marks in my dust-covered jour-
nal and the carefully written letters to my
loved ones, loneliness is no longer an option.
I sat perched on my rock on the last day
of my solo. The birds chirping, a trickle of a
nearby stream and the wind rustling leaves
across the dirt filled the potential silencer
The marmot appeared again, sitting directly
across from me. As I realized that I would
never see my marmot friend again, we made
eye contact.
The crunch of boots in the dirt grew
louder as Kenzie approached me. I shifted
my gaze from the marmot to her. She ges-
tured for me to come with her. I hopped off
my rock, grabbed my backpack and began to
walk.
I turned around to take one last look at
my spot as I realized that I will probably
never return to it again. My rock, my trees,''
my meadow, my marmot; my companions
were to live only as a memory from now
on. The thought of never returning did not
bother me, though. My quadrant did its job:
It released me from the constraints of per-
petual solitude.

slipped into my sleeping bag with hopes that
I'd fall asleep before it turned dark.
The sun leaked through the tarp, first hit-
ting my blue Nalgene bottle above my head.
The reflected light warmed my face, waking
me up.
I immediately grabbed my journal and
read what I wrote the previous afternoon.
I read over each word, even taking time to
correct my own spelling and grammar. This
tedious focus on correction served as a tem-
porary form of entertainment.
I closed the journal. What is there to do
now?
I stepped out of my sleeping bag and head-
ed towards a big, light gray rock. With my
journal and pen in hand, I scaled up the rock,
and sat comfortably in the crevice at the top.
I surveyed my surroundings fromthe highest
point in my quadrant, gazing down through

above my head as I remembered a conversa-
tion my friends had before we departed on
our solos:
"Are you going to write her a letter?"
"Probably. Are you going to write any?"
"Probably."
Letters hadn't even crossed my mind.
With nothing to do for the next few days but
to think and write, this would serve as the
perfect opportunity to create a piece for each
person in my life who motivated me in some
way.
I opened my journal. I began with the
easier, less intimidating letters - the ones for
my friends. I sat with each letter for nearly
an hour, contemplating the perfect memo-
ries to recall and the best way to phrase what
exactly each of them meant to me. I closed
my journal, hesitating to move on to the more
difficult ones: my boyfriend, mom, dad and
two sisters.
Each of these took much longer than I
expected, as my letter writing bled into the

The Scientific Club: By invitation only
by Paige Pearcy

outtakes photo by patrick barron/daily
__ __ __onthe record

V hen I was handed the list, it had a
tinge of holiness to it - University
holiness, if that exists. The names
r ,ed from past and present University
p: idents to various professors with named
pi essorships or deanships or both - the top
so tars on campus.
hen I was told membership was controlled
by iow many people can fit into a house, and
tl- only rule was there were no rules. I was
in 'gued. What was this seemingly elitist
ur sown group of faculty members, why were
th calling themselves the Scientific Club?
tudents probably haven't heard of it. Fac-
ul members probably haven't heard of it.
Oi y those who are in the Scientific Club know
about it. But it isn't a secret society.
It's directed at being quiet, but not secre-
tive. It's not secretive at all," Scientific Club
member Charles Eisendrath, director of the
Knight-Wallace fellows program at the Uni-
versity, said.
Once a month during the academic year,
a group of about 15 faculty members in the
Scientific Club meet for dinner. They discuss
anything they want, and they learn from
each other.
"It's kind of like a salon in the tradition of
18th century French notion of getting people
of intellectual curiosity together for a good
meal, conversation and for entertainment,"
Sc ntific Club member David Featherman,
pr fessor emeritus of sociology, said.
These 15 or so people are a part of the 42
current members of the Scientific Club - a
group comprised of senior faculty from differ-
ent walks of the University.
But how does a faculty member become a
member of this group? Well, they won't know
intil they're in.
Joining the club
Wh- "You can't just say you want to join.You have
to be elected."
"It's an elected society," Howard Markel, a
history of medicine professor and club mem-
ber, said.
At the end of each academic year, the mem-
bers begin an election process to decide new
members. During this process, a member must
nominate someone before the club, followed by
a discussion about the nominee.
"We take nominations every year, but some
years we don't necessarily act on them," Markel
said. "Or there may be a slow year and nobody
-dominates anybody, so it's not every year a new
member comes, but it is a good idea if you want
to keep something going."
Resumes are passed around and the club
votes on whether or not the nominee is a
good candidate. Once a person is selected and
approved, two people who know that professor
-approach them and ask them to be a member.
Kenneth Warner, a professor of public
health and former dean of the School of Public

Health, went to ask a new member to join ear-
lier this year.
"He did not know about the club, which I
think is the norm," Warner said. "I think most
people probably don't know about it, which
is interesting because this thing ... really has
some history to it."
Most of the members had never known
about the club until they were asked to join.
"It used to meet in people's home under the
presumption that the nonmember's spouse,
usually a woman, would prepare the meal and
then disappear while the members would hold
fort," Featherman said. "Forty is about what
could be expected to fit in anybody's home, but
that would assume that everyone would show
up."
Participation has changed over time, but
membership stays between 30 and 40.
Members don't have to be current profes-
sors though. The oldest member of the club,
John Reed, is 94-years-young and an emeri-
tus professor of law. Reed said overtime he's
experienced a variety of presentations that he's
learned from.
"We've had quite a variety of presentations
as you would suppose. We've got scientists and
artists and historians," Reed said. "Everything
from methodology to substance."
This year, Reed gave his first presentation to
the club in 1oyears.
"He gave one of the liveliest and sprightli-
est and most spirited presentations I had heard
in a very long time," Eisendrath said. "It was
about why there are so few trials. He's a law-
yer, and it was really interesting and everybody
had the same reaction 'Oh! Oh my god, I didn't
know that!"'
The new members are asked to join at the
annual banquet, which takes the place of the
last meeting of the year in May and is a longer,
generally catered meeting. It is the only meet-
ing that spouses of members are invited to
attend.
Historically historical
The Scientific Club began in 1883 and was
founded by former Physiology Prof. Henry

Sewall and former Chemistry Prof. John Lang-
ley as a branching off from the defunct Ann
Arbor Scientific Association. Sewall and Lang-
ley invited 12 other male University professors
- all of whom were affiliated with different
sciences - to join. They began to hold monthly
meetings where there was a presentation and
the men discussed anything they pleased over
food and smoking.
The club had no rules and still holds true to
that. There are no rituals and no ceremonies.
Most of the members were affiliated with the
natural sciences when the club started, but that
changed over time.
"Now, it consists of a whole spectrum really
of faculties across the schools and colleges,"
Featherman said. "If you use that as a map of
intellectual spectrum, there wouldbe someone
from almost anywhere you can imagine from
campus."
And he's right. The current membership has
faculty from every school at the University.
Markel said the initial make-up of the club
has changed with time as well.
"There was a little bit of gendering to it in
the olden days that fortunately has been cor-
rected," Markel said. "It used to be that gentle-
men with mutton chop whiskers, I imagine,
and moustaches retired from the dining room
to smoke cigars and drink brandy and all that
nonsense. It's an equal opportunity club now,
thankfully, but all these old clubs that's how
they started."
Women were invited to join in 1977 and the
smoking stopped, but the monthly meetings in
the host's home still persist.
A monthly dinner
"We get to know each other better, and we
get to know about some very interesting things
that we wouldn't otherwise know about,"
Featherman said.
Once a month, the club is generally invited
to meet at a house - though sometimes it is at a
restaurant or a place on campus, so long as it's
quiet and not overly large - where they have
dinner and listen to a presentation. The person
who hosts the club makes the presentation.

The host - who will make the presenta-
tion - is selected by the club's principal ser-
vant, a member who is drawn from a round,
black bowler hat at the last meeting of the
year and serves as the only named position
in the club.
"A wonderful term, I know of no better
term for a chair of group than that," Reed
said. "I've occasionally made speeches
around the country to groups of lawyers and
I've somehow managed to work in that the
true indication of a good leader is if he's the
principal servant."
The principal servant organizes every
meeting for the academic year. The bowler hat
the club uses for selecting the principal servant
is unique too - it's one of the club's artifacts.
"Nobody quite knows where it's from,"
Markel said.
This year's principal servant, Charles
Eisendrath, said it needs to be clarified that
the artifacts are "sort of a joke ... they have
no significance, no ceremonial importance."
The items the club possesses are merely
tradition of the group and the only physi-
cal representation of the body. A machete of
unknown origin, some gold coins, Russian
bonds whose whereabouts are unknown and
other trinkets accompany the bowler hat.
At the meeting, the host's presentation can
be about anything, so long as everyone at the
meeting can understand and comprehend it.
"Everyone who presents has to present in
layperson's language." Warner said. "Every
presentation is brought to a level at which
everybody else can understand it and that
allows you access to some very intriguing
ideas, concepts, empirical evidence that you
probably wouldn't have otherwise and that
does make ita lot of fun."
At this month's meeting, Featherman gave
a talk not about his work as a social scientist,
but about becoming a fiction writer.
"Most of what I've done, and one of the
reasons I was invited into the Scientific Club,
was because of what I did as a social scientist
but (at this month's meeting) it was my com-
ing out of my closet," Featherman said. "So
that was my story, 'this is how I got started
in fiction' and so I did some readings of some
of my stories and we talked about all that."
Members don't generally talk about being
members of the club with others because, as
Eisendrath said, "It's like not talking about
something that the other person doesn't
know anything about anyway."
However, when presentations are particu-
larly compelling the members are more likely
to discuss those outside of meetings.
"I've learned a lot through the presenta-
tions," Warner said. "There are a couple of
them thatI sort of come back to and reference
in conversations on other subjects repeatedly
because they were so stimulating and really
made me think about how things worked in
the world."

THE RESEARCH DIFFERENCE
How the University varies the value of faculty members
By Amrutha Sivakumar

:

The University is known as a
major research university. But
with almost 27,000 undergradu-
ate students, how does the University
ensure that teaching is a main focus as
well?
The union representing lecturers has
been bargaining for increased wages
for its members, hoping to gain not only
recognition but also pay compensation
equal to research faculty members. The
obstacle, however, is deciphering why
exactly these lecturers are valued less
than their research-focused counter-
parts.
Over 1,400 lecturers across all three
University campuses are full-time Uni-
versity employees paid to teach under-
graduate courses across all areas of
academia.
The Lecturer's Employee Organi-
zation represents these employees. In
cases where employees feel the Univer-
sity has shortchanged their dues, LEO
tries to maximize wages and benefits of
its members.
While both types of University
employees fall under the category of
non-tenured University staff, the job
profile of atenure-track faculty member
includes fulfilling research and service
requirements alongside teaching, while
lecturers are paid almost exclusively for
their work in the classroom.
Lila Naydan, a lecturer and LEO
Communications Committee co-chair,
said despite "top-notch teaching eval-
uations," lecturers are not paid the
deserved compensation for their work.
"We deserve equal pay for the teach-
ing portion of our work because we're
dedicated teachers," Naydan wrote in
an e-mail. "We deserve to be recog-
nized by the U-M administration for
our experience in the classroom."
Sociology Lecturer Ian Robinson's
said in his report on equal pay that lec-
turers are paid approximately 50 per-
cent of what tenure-track professors are
paid for the teaching portion of their
work.
"When we talk about equal pay for
equal work, we are not talking about
making the same salary as tenured and
tenure-track faculty members," Naydan
said. "We are talking about making the
same amount per course taught."

"It's an important distinction and I
think it speaks mainly for how commit-
ted lecturers are to teaching," Naydan
added. "This is the main component of
our job and it's what we really dedicate
ourselves to."
On March 5, the LEO Union Council
met with University administrators to
finalize a tentative collective bargain-
ing agreement. Hoping to satisfy the
demands of both parties, LEO members
are currently voting on the agreement.
The contract entails an 8.25 percent
salary increase to the starting salary
of lecturers over a period of five years.
While this contract ensures annual pay
hikes for lecturers, a large differential
between tenure-track professor and
lecturer salaries would still exist.
Though content with the outcome of
bargaining, Naydan said LEO will con-
tinue to strive for pay equity for its lec-
turers.
"We're happy with the contract,"
Naydan affirmed. "It's my hope that in
future contract negotiations we make
greater progress towards pay equity for
the teaching portion of our work."
With over a decade of service to the
University and a vast portfolio of teach-
ing and research accomplishments under
their belt, tenured professors seem to be
the University's most prized possession.
Through a combination of distinguished
pedagogy, research publications and ser-
vice to the University, tenured professors
represent the creme de la creme.
But before professors can receive ten-
ure, they are hired as tenure-track facul-
ty. Many of these tenure-track professors
have one absolute goal: to prove their
worth to the administration.
Christina Whitman, vice provost for
academic and faculty affairs, made it
clear that the higher salaries and benefits
for tenure and tenure-track faculty did
not come sans strings attached.
Unlike lecturers hired for fixed periods
of time, tenure-track professors are put
under the pressure of a "tenure-clock,"
the six to 10 year time period during
which professors must prove to Univer-
sity administrators that they deserve to
hold a lifetime of professorship at the
institute.
Professors denied tenure after serving
their tenure-clock must leave the Univer-

sity within a year.
"Somebody who is (on the) tenure-
track is expected to be producing some
fairly serious research and will not retain
the job if they aren't," Whitman said.
While tenure-track professors are
brought into the institution with the
hopes that they'll fulfill the promise in
research and teaching that the University
believed was reflected in their graduate
work, Whitman said the University hires
lecturers for a very different purpose.
"When we hire somebody as a lectur-
er, we are asking them to teach well for
a defined, limited period," she said. "We
are looking for somebody who is really
specializing in pedagogy rather than peo-
ple who are bringing their scholarship
into the classroom."
In the aftermath of LEO negotiations,
Whitman believed that comparing lec-
turer salaries with those of tenure-track
faculty was impossible because of differ-
ent skill.
While not disputing the importance
of lecturers in a classroom, Whitman
elucidated that professors are constantly
expected to think and work outside of
their business hours in ways "outside-
the-box."
Teaching that is influenced by and
incorporated with a faculty member's
research is crucial to professorship,
Whitman explained.
"When we are looking to make a per-
manent commitment to someone, like
tenure, we are looking for people whom
we think have the confidence that all of
the things that they do will build on the
other things that they do," Whitman said.
"We think their teaching should benefit
from their research and their research
should benefit from their teaching."
University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said teaching and research were homoge-
neous in a tenured-professors portfolio.
This "blending together" of research and
teaching defines a professor at the Uni-
versity, he said.
"We're actually trying to encour-
age more of that experiential, hands-on
learning," Fitzgerald added. "That's likely
to be more and more a part of the educa-
tional component, more than just sitting
in a classroom."
But when it comes to raising the bar
in. the .classroom, all forms of faculty

can turn to the University's Center for
Research on Learning and Teaching,
where research focuses on teaching
itself and a common goal to succeed in
the classroom exists.
The CRLT is the first of its kind in the
country. With its origins in the Office of
the Provost, the CRLT works with all 19
schools and colleges to teach teachers
how to better improve their classroom
skills.
Comprised of a core group of 12 Ph.D.
graduates with extensive experience in
teaching and working with other teach-
ers, CRLT brings together tenured,
tenure-track, lecturers and graduate
student instructors on a common plat-
form to learn from one another's prac-
tices.
Matt Kaplan, managing director
of the center, explained that one of
the core functions of the CRLT is to
research ways to increase the effective-
ness of teaching at the University.
For example, when the University
decided to shift some internet infra-
structure to Google, CRLT realized that
the majority of teaching faculty would
limit themselves to generic Google ser-
vices, such as Gmail and Calendars,
without realizingthe potential utilityof
other applications.
"We realized that there was a lot of
possibility to promote collaboration
between students and teachers," Kaplan
said. "We went to ITS with the idea that
it would be a pity if people didn't realize
the applications that they could make
use of for their teaching."
As a result, the CRLT invited a group
of 25 faculty members from across the
University to a learning community,
where members were given the oppor-
tunity to explore the applications in
their own classes, later sharing their
experiences in monthly meetings.
This teaching goes hand in hand with
research. To avoid limiting the findings
to only those in the learning commu-
nity, CRLT summarized their findings
in a formal paper and shared it with the
Office of the Provost and other Univer-
sity faculty to develop the ideas further.
"It's easier to think about how we
can implement things in our own class-
room when we hear about a colleague,"
Kaplan explained. "Michigan is really a
national model for having centers like
ours to improve the teaching of faculty
and graduate students." Mark Moldwin,

associate chair and professor of Atmo-
spheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences,
said the University's research in the
field of teaching is helpful.
"What's helped me in my career is
knowing that there is an entire commu-
nity of education researchers who study
how people are teaching and the most
effective way to help students learn,"
Moldwin said.
Though the CRLT is operated under
the Office of the Provost, Kaplan
assured that its evaluations of teaching
faculty are never disclosed to the Office
for use during tenure review.
Kaplan added the CRLT never report
their findings to administrators since
they work directly with faculty. Never-
theless, he said that many faculty mem-
bers chose to report their involvement
with CRLT to administrators to demon-
strate their commitment to teaching.
"They want to be able to be straight
with the professor and (make the
CRLT) a safe place to talk about teach-
ing problems," Whitman said.
Simultaneously, Whitman confirmed
that association with CRLT could work
in favor of tenure-track faculty during
tenure review.
"It is a big plus if somebody has
worked with CRLT, especially if they've
had some problems in the classroom,"
Whitman added. "We actually think
that CRLT has turned some people
around in really nice ways."
Moldwin echoed that the CRLT aids
lecturers in bettering themselves as
teachers.
"If you are not a leading researcher, it
is very difficult to get tenure. But if you.
are a terrible teacher, then that is part
of our mistake," he added. "We should
catch that much earlier and provide the
resources to get better."
Whitman said even fully-tenured
professors were encouraged to utilize
CRLT resources in cases where their
teaching appeared to be subpar. She
also noted cases where faculty with
quality research accomplishments had
been denied tenure due to poor instruc-
tion.
Though the University is a major
research university, policies imply
equality in research and teaching
endeavors.

According to the University's Fac-
ulty Handbook, which is published on
the Office of the Provost's website, fac-
ulty are required to be distinguished
"scholars and teachers" before they are
considered for tenure review. Further-
more, the University's Vision State-
ment defines the institution as having
"a culture of interdisciplinary teaching
and research, coupled with academic
rigor."
To shake up the career path of a lec-
turer, the Office of the Provost is work-
ing on developing more opportunities
for the teaching staff. With opportu-
nities that include helping other lec-
turers learn how to teach and gain
administrative roles, lecturers have a
scope for career advancement indepen-
dent of research.
While LEO's website states that no
lecturer is eligible for "traditional aca-
demic protection," or tenure, Whitman
said there have been exceptional cir-
cumstances where the scholarship of
a lecturer exceeded the quality of ten-
ured faculty.
Whitman knows of at least one case
where a lecturer showed significant
progress in research, causing him to be
re-evaluated and hired as tenure-track
faculty.
Whitman also said by demanding
tenure-track professors to submit
teaching and research statements
simultaneously when up for tenure
review, the Office of the Provost
could weigh both components in par-
allel.
Extensive research reviews unde-
niably carry a large weight in the
portfolio of any tenure-track fac-
ulty. However, teaching documenta-
tion is also a mandate, where student
course evaluations, faculty syllabi and
reviews by other senior faculty help
the Office of the Provost determine
the teaching qualifications of each
professor.
Moldwin said he also hopes to see a
better balance between teaching and
research at the University.
"One of my professional goals is
to influence academia, particularly
