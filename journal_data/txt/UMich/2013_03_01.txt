ACADEMICS
.as LSA syllabi archived

Student gov't
leaders work with
University
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
After two years of work by
the LSA Student Government,
LSA students can finally design
a course schedule with no exams
through a new website that
archives past class syllabi.
LSA senior Pallavi Abraham,
LSA-SG's Academic Relations
Officer, said the website, which
has been a collaborative effort
between LSA-SG and the col-
lege's administration, has been a
long time coming, but time well
spent.
"It's done,"Abraham said. "It's
up and running - the website's
live."

Many syllabi are already avail-
able on the site currently and
departments are still uploading
more.
"Obviously, professors aren't
required to upload their syllabi
in any way. Yet we hope that,
as more and more departments
start doing it, professors will
start to see the usefulness of it
and ideally it'll eventually be an
all-inclusive syllabi archive," LSA
junior Jason van den Boogaart, a
member of LSA-SG, said.
LSA Associate Dean Philip
Deloria sent out an e-mail to LSA
department heads about the web-
site, noting that it was "simple,
streamlined, and easy to use."
"We view this tool as provid-
ing real value to departments,
students, and faculty alike, and
encourage you to begin the pro-
cess of establishing a syllabus
archive for your department or
program," he wrote.

Abraham said faculty mem-
bers were intially concerned
about the intellectual property
rights of their syllabi and that
students would expect faculty to
adhere to a past semesters' sylla-
bi. However, the system address-
es both of these problems, she
said. Using the system requires a
University account to login, and a
disclaimer on the top of the page
tells students these syllabi are
not necessarily in use.
Abraham -said -she realized
providing the syllabi for the cur-
rent semester before registration
wouldn't be possible after speak-
ing with outgoing LSA Dean Ter-
rence McDonald last year. He
said McDonald told him due to
the autonomy faculty have in the
college, requiring syllabi up so
early would not be feasible.
Nonetheless,vanden Boogaart
said this will be a tool available
for years to come as the LSA

administration is heavily invest-
ed in the project.
"It's something that together
we worked on and created," he
said. "It's more than just what
the students wanted, it's actually
a really good balance of what the
professors wanted, the curriculum
wanted and the students wanted."
Making syllabi available
before students registered was
a campaign promise of Manish
Parikh, current president of the
Central Student Government.
"I think there has been some
confusion as whether or not this
has been an (LSA-SG) or CSG
project and I think that this is
really a great example of some-
thing that LSA student govern-
ment has been working on slowly
and created a beautiful product,"
she said.
Parikh said he was proud of
the work of LSA-SG, and hopes a

Zaragon Place
resident seen
moving out of apt.
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
After three students report-
ed that they were sexually
assaulted at the same seventh-
floor Zaragon Place apartment,
building administrators are
evicting the assault suspect
and taking preventative mea-
sures to ensure similar inci-
dents don't occur and police are
investigating the connection
between the two cases.
Jim Adams, the property
manager at the East University
apartment building, said upon
hearing news of the sexual
assaults, building employees
immediately began the process
of evicting the suspect. While
building employees have seen
him moving out, Adams said
management will continue the
formal eviction process.
"We have already started
eviction proceedings, but we
also have reason to believe he
has already moved out," Adams
said. "As a precautionary,
regardless, we're going to go
through with an eviction pro-
ceeding."
According to the crime alert
released by University Police on
Wednesday night, the suspect
is a younger-looking 31-year-
old Asian male with short black
hair and brown eyes. He is

between 5'6" and 57" tall and
weighs 140 pounds.
Adams expressed concern
that Zaragon officials were only
notified of the incidents last
night when the crime alert was
sent out. He said the building's
security has been briefed on the
incident and are doing their best
to promote asafe environment.
"It's the first episode of this
nature that has happened here,
and we certainly don't hope to
have any more," Adams said.
"It's important people become
educated on the dangers of
drinking alcohol, minors
drinking alcohol and even more
importantly, for people that are
not minors providing for and
drinking with students that are
minors."
Adams added that Zara-
gon Place will be reviewing
its apartment guest policies to
determine whether changes
need to be made to prevent par-
ties from getting out of hand.
"Obviously students are
going to get together, but we
just want to make sure it's
going to be in a controlled envi-
-ronment - which it always has
been here," he said. "I don't
consider this to be an issue with
guests, but one person can ruin
that. We're very disappointed,
obviously."
The suspect's description
does not match the suspect
currently being investigated for
the West Quad sexual assault in
January.

Kunselman sees
problems with
A2 taxi policies

HANDS-ON ART

City council
member at odds
with limo services
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
After taxi drivers were
implicated in three different
crimes since January, the Ann
Arbor City Council has been
at odds with taxicab and limo
companies in defining what
type of licensing is right for the
tree town.
After a student reported
she was raped by a taxi driver,
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) spoke out
at the Feb. 4 Ann Arbor City
Council meeting. He said the
city has a serious problem with
unlicensed taxicabs and "rogue
limos."
On Feb. 10, almost a week
later, a 23-year-old woman
said she was touched in a sex-
ual manner by a Blue Cab taxi
driver. Blue Cab said the driver
denies this report and reas-
sured customers that the driver
& would not be allowed to drive

taxis in the future. Police then
acknowledged that a similar
incident occurred on Jan.23.
The city has been unable
to regulate certain companies
since they operate throughout
the state of Michigan rather
than just Ann Arbor. A 1990 law
states that cities do not have
the authority to regulate com-
panies that operate both inside
and outside of specific munici-
pal boundaries.
Kunselman said he believes
the problem lies in the issue
of rogue limousines operating
with state - not city - licenses.
"The general public doesn't
really understand what's hap-
pening, and so they assume
everybody's a taxi," Kunselman
said.
Kunselman said the under-
lying issue is the city doesn't
know who the drivers in these
cases. Thus, companies are
allowed to operate within the
city's boundaries without the
city's knowledge of the driver's
identity.
"As a parent, we tell our kids
not to get in cars with strang-
ers,"Kunselman said. "We have

Is a college
degree
worth it?
Expert, student
say University
educaiton offers
unique experiences
By CONNOR ZARKOWSKI
For the Daily
Many college students' par-
ents could have started a career
with just a high school diploma
and a positive attitude. Today,
however, University students and
employees are becoming more
aware of how a college experi-
ence can lead to a much more
fruitful professional life.
With 68.3 percent of 2011
high-school graduates enroll-
ing in colleges or universities,
its becoming harder and harder
to deny the significance of an
undergraduate degree. A recent
article in The New York Times
reported that a degree is becom-
ing the norm for jobs such as file
clerks, which did not require the
degree a decade ago.
Lynne Sebille-White, senior
assistant director of employer
relations at the University's
Career Center, said a bachelor's

Federal cuts to
severely decrease
allotted funding
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
The inaction of Washing-
ton D.C. to prevent massive
automatic spending cuts that
are triggered on Friday should
perk the interest of the 3,363

University students utilizing
work study as part of their
financial aid packages.
The threat of federal seques-
tration - over a billion dollars
in across-the-board cuts that
roll out over 10 years - was
intended to force lawmakers
into a compromise to address
government spending. The
White House released a state-
by-state breakdown of what
the the cuts would affect that
indicated about 2,490 fewer

low-income students in Michi-
gan would receive financial aid
and about 1,300 fewer students
will get work-study jobs.
Kurt Weiss, public informa-
tion officer for the state's bud-
get office, said the becoming a
reality is a concern of the state
legislature.
"Obviously we're concerned
with any kinds of cuts," Weiss
said. "We understand that

Young priests wait to see the helicopter taking Pope Benedict XVI from the Vatican in Rome to Castel Gandolfo in the Italian countryside on Thursday.
In historic resignation, Pope *
bids Vatican solemn farewell

MUF Un.

Benedict XVI will
live at Vatican in
retirement
CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy
(AP) - As bells tolled and the
clock struck 8, the brass-stud-
ded wooden doors swung shut
Thursday at this palace in the
Italian hills, marking an end to
Benedict XVI's papacy and the
start of his final journey as a
"simple pilgrim."
Capping a day of tearful fare-
wells that included an extraordi-
nary pledge of obedience to his
successor, Benedict entered his-
tory as the first pope in 600 years
to resign - leaving the Catholic
Church in unprecedented limbo
and ending a pontificate shaped
by struggles to move beyond
clerical sex abuse scandals and
reawaken Christianity in an
indifferent world.
On Benedict's last day, the
mood was vastly different inside
the Vatican than at Castel Gan-
dolfo, the 17th-century papal
retreat set in the hills south of
Rome, where he will spend the

first two months of his retire-
ment.
At the seat of the popes,
Benedict's staff bade the pontiff
goodbye in scenes of dignified
solemnity, with Swiss Guards in
full regalia and prelates kneel-
ing to kiss his papal ring one last
time.
A livelier atmosphere reigned
in the countryside, with well-
wishers jamming the hilltop
town's main square, shouting
"Viva ii Papa!" and waving the
yellow and white flags of the Holy
See.
Cheers went up as the 85-year-
old Benedict stepped out onto the
palace balcony and, arms out-
stretched, declared his papacy
was nearing the end.
"I am simply a pilgrim begin-
ning the last leg of his pilgrimage
on this Earth," he said. Then giv-
ing a final blessing, he declared:
"Grazie e buona notte" - "Thank
you and good night" in Italian.
It was a remarkable bookend
to a papacy that began on April
19, 2005, with a similarly meek
speech delivered from the loggia
overlooking St. Peter's Square,
where the newly elected Bene-

diet said he was but a "simple
humble worker in the vineyard of
the Lord."
Over his eight-year papacy,
Benedict tried to set the church
on a more traditional course, con-
vinced that all the ills afflicting it
- sexual abuse, dwindling num-
bers of priests and empty pews
- were a result of a misreading of
thereformsofthe Second Vatican
Council.
His successor is likely to follow
in his footsteps, given that the
vast majority of the 115 cardinals
who will elect the nextpope were
appointed by Benedict himself
and share his conservative bent.
For the time being, the gov-
ernance of the church shifts to
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the
camerlengo, or chamberlain, who
along with the College of Cardi-
nals will guide the church and
make plans starting Monday for
the conclave to elect the 266th
leader of the world's 1.2 billion
Catholics.
One of Bertone's first acts
was to lock the papal apartment
inside the Vatican. In another
task steeped in symbolism, he
will ensure that Benedict's papal

ringand seal are destroyed.
Benedict's journey into retire-
ment began with a final audi-
ence with his cardinals, where
he sought to defuse concerns
about his future role and the pos-
sible conflicts arising from hav-
ing both a reigning and a retired
pope living side-by-side inside
the Vatican.
"Among you is also the future
pope, whom I today promise my
unconditional reverence and obe-
dience," Benedict told the cardi-
nals.
Benedict's decision to live at
the Vatican in retirement, wear
the white cassock associated
with the papacy and be called
"emeritus pope" and "Your Holi-
ness," rather than revert back to
his birth name, Joseph Ratzinger,
has deepened concerns about the
shadow he might cast over the
next pope.
Benedict has tried to address
those worries, saying that he will
be "hidden from the world" and
live a life of prayer in retirement.
On Thursday, he took a step fur-
ther with his own public pledge
to place himself entirely under
the authority of the new pope.

they've wanted for a long time and
LSA-SG has truly done a phenom-
enal job in making ithappen."
Parikh said he and other mem-

tors within the provost's office
for months now about the pos-
sibility of providing syllabi to
students. While he's nearing the
end of his term, he said a syllabi
archive is well on its way to all
students.
"We just need to figure out the
details now."

TAXI
From Page 1
alotofunsuspectingcollege kids
that come into our community
and probably aren't aware of
what's going on."
The suspect from the
alleged rape reported on Feb.
10 was identified because
Blue Cab is one of the compa-
nies licensed and regulated by
the city. The Blue Cab driver
did undergo background
checks as a part of the licens-
ing process.
Kunselman said the ability to
identify cab companies and their
driver is a merit of the city's sys-
tem.
"The other two alleged
assaults - we have no idea if
they were limos or taxis because
there's no record of limousines
that operate within the city,"

Kunselman said.
John Heed, the former chief
operating officer of Select Ride,
the parent company of Arbor
Limousine and Yellow Car,
wrote in a letter to Daily that he
doesn't understand how Kunsel-
man can come to the conclusion
that companies licensed and
regulated by the city can be con-
sidered safer than those licensed
by the state.
Heed said he believes the
city is out of bounds on this
issue, calling Kunselman's com-
ments "grossly irresponsible and
inflammatory" and going so far
as to say this may qualify as a
"defamation of business."
Tim Tobias, president of
Michigan Green Cab, said
he believes the city has no
authority to regulate the com-
pany because they are already
licensed by the state. He added
that Kunselman's use of the

term "rogue limos" is irrespon-
sible.
"(The city is) trying to leg-
islate the state-chartered lim-
ousines, which they don't have
the authority to do, but they're
certainlytrying to do so," Tobias
said.
Tobias said when his brother
started Green Cab, he chose to be
chartered by the state because it
better suited city-to-city travel.
Not only does Michigan Green
Cab operate within the laws of
the state, but they took further
measures - Tobias called them
"voluntary concessions" - to
ensure clarity for their custom-
ers. In early 2011, they removed
decals on their cars that have the
word "taxi" and replaced them
with "licensed limos" decals,
before the ordinance required
them to do so. The signs on the
top of their vehicles also read
"limousine."

Tobias said he sees the city
as using the recent crimes as a
means to gain an advantage and
try to regulate these companies
that are already monitored by
the state.
"Interesting that the only
driver charged was a Blue Cab
driver - (a) driver and company
licensed under the city taxicab
ordinances," Tobias said.
He added that the city offi-
cials and the taxicab board may
be heeding pressure from taxi-
cab companies to enforce regu-
lations on companies like Green
Cab because they find it hard to
compete.
"If these local taxicab compa-
nies want to compete with our
service then they need to turn in
their used police cruisers ... and
get some polite, uniformed driv-
ers," Tobias said. "We've raised
the bar in Ann Arbor ... and
nobody's happy about it."


SEQUESTRATION

to real people and that it will
most certainly have an impact
on them and their families."
Weiss added that Gov. Rick
Snyder and the legislature
would have preferred a more
comprehensive, itemized
approach, as opposed to the
"whack" that the budget will
get as a result of the sequester.
University spokeswoman
Kelly Cunningham said if
sequestration was totake effect,
students currently enrolled in
work-study would be covered
for this semester, though those
looking to apply for next term

would face greater difficulty.
"Our current work-study
participants would not be
affected," Cunningham said.
"However, if this was to hap-
pen, there would be less money
delegated to work-study, and
that means less jobs will be
available for students."
Cindy Bank, assistant direc-
tor of the University's Washing-
ton office - which is responsible
for lobbying for the University
at the federal level - said while
decreased funds would are an
issue, whatever funds were
allotted for the work-study pro-
gram would also be used at the
Dearborn and Flint campuses.
"It won't affect every stu-
dent, but the ones it does affect

will be hit hard," Bank said.
Other issues that could
potentially affect the Uni-
versity include decreases in
the Department of Education
budget, increased origination
fees and decreasing funds for
the supplemental opportunity
grant - money delegated to the
"poorest of the poor."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin of Ann
Arbor said sequestration could
make college unaffordable for
some students.
"One of the problems with
colleges - specifically U of M
because it's.so expensive - is
that we see a declining level
of socioeconomic diversity,"
Irwin said. "People either can't
afford to go, or are graduating

college with crippling amounts
of debt."
Irwin added that it is impor-
tant to make college attainable
for those who qualify for admis-
sion to a college or university.
"We need to find a way
for capable, motivated young
people to be able to get
through college and still be
able to put food on the table,"
Irwin said. "It will undoubt-
edly be a huge strain on these
individuals as they attempt to
pay their way."
Though multiple sources said
they're "unsure" as to the spe-
cific effect that sequestration
will have on the University's
funding towards work study,
predictions are not optimistic.

DEGREE
From Page 1
onstrates to employers that
students possess skill sets neces-
sary for any job. She added that
the fact that students pursue a
degree at a top University shows
that they are motivated.
"From an employer's stand-
point, they are not as concerned
with what the person's degree is
in, or what their major is, they're
more concerned about the skill
sets they've developed in the
classroom, as well as outside
the classroom, and how those fit
with the nature of the position,"
Sebille-White said.
Sebille-White said LSA stu-
dents make up the majority of
visitors at the Career Center.
She said the variety of educa-
tion options offered in a liberal
arts degree hone critical think-
ing skills for students, which
appeals to companies hiring
graduates.
While access to different sub-
jects is important to develop-
ing the different sets of skills,
Sebille-White noted that what a
student focuses their studies on
is crucial to the path.
"The job that pays the
most money is not always
the best," Sebille-White said.
"Investing time into finding
your calling is more reward-
ing than a paycheck from a
job you disdain."
While many entering the job
market complain of the increas-

ing demand for higher educa-
tion, a trend dubbed "degree
inflation" by economists, some
students at the University see
the undergraduate degree as
providing the opportunity to
find one's dream career.
Business senior Laurel Cham-
berlain said one of the benefits
of studying the University is the
opportunity to explore unfamil-
iar interests through classes and
student organizations.
"(College) gives you the
chance to do things you wouldn't
normally do if you were at a job
doing the same thing every day,"
Chamberlain said.
Chamberlain said her educa-
tion also helped her attain com-
petitive internships in fields she
was potentially interested in
pursuing.
Last summer, Chamberlain
interned at L'Ordal, the cos-
metics company. She said she
enjoyed working at L'Oreal
but was glad she started at the
internship level because she
decided the career path was not
something in which she was
interested.
Chamberlain said the experi-
ence led her to realize her true
passion for human resources.
She will be working for Capital
One after graduation.
Chamberain said she is glad
that she pursued an undergrad-
uate degree because it led her to
an exciting career path.
"I feel, more than anything, it
(makes you) the type of person
you become."

U.S. pledges new
aid package to
Syrian rebels
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian reb-
els clashed with regime troops
in the narrow stone alleyways
around a historic 12th century
mosque in the Old City of Alep-
po on Thursday, while a gov-
ernment airstrike north of the
city killed at least seven people,
activists said.
The rebels, who have been
slowly chipping away at the
regime's hold on Aleppo,
received a boost from the U.S.
in their fight to oust Syrian
President Bashar Assad.
Washington pledged an addi-
tional $60 million in assistance
to the opposition and - in a
significant policy shift - said
that for the first time it will
provide non-lethal aid like food
and medical supplies directly to
rebel forces on the ground.
U.S. Secretary of State
John Kerry announced the
decision Thursday on the
sidelines of an international
conference on Syria in Rome.
European nations also were
expected to signal their
intention to provide fresh
assistance to the opposition,
possibly including defensive
military hardware.
The rebels have made a num-
berofstrategic gains innorthern
Syria in recent weeks, including
the capture of a hydroelectric
dam and some military bases.
They also have been regularly
hitting the heart of Damascus
with mortar rounds, puncturing
the aura of normalcy that the

regime has tried to cultivate in
the capital.
In Aleppo, a key battleground
in the civil war, clashes raged
around the landmark Umayyad
Mosque in the walled Old City,
the Britain-based Syrian Obser-
vatory for Human Rights said.
The rebels control one part of the
mosque, and government troops
hold the other.
Rebels launched an offensive
on Aleppo, Syria's largest urban
center and its commercial capi-
tal, in July 2012. Since then, the
city has been carved into rebel-
and government-controlled
zones in brutal street fighting
that has destroyed entire neigh-
borhoods and damaged some of
the ancient city's rich archaeo-
logical and cultural heritage.
The Umayyad Mosque, also
known as the Great Mosque
of Aleppo, sits near a medieval
covered market in the Old City,
which is a UNESCO World Heri-
tage site. The mosque was heav-
ily damaged in October 2012 just
weeks after a fire gutted th old
city's famed market.
North of Aleppo, a government
airstrike on the village of Deir
Jamalkilled atleast seven people,
including five children, accord-
ing to the Observatory. It was not
immediately clear what the target
was, but regime warplanes fre-
quently carry out bombing runs
on rebel-held towns.
Farther south, in the central
city of Homs, the state news
agency said a car bomb caused
casualties and extensive material
damage, but it did not elaborate.
An official in the Homs gov-
ernor's office told The Associ-
ated Press that there were two
blasts and that four people were

killed and at least six wounded.
The official spoke on condition
of anonymity in line with regu-
lations.
With the bloodshed showing
no sign of abating, the Syrian
opposition has grown increas-
ingly frustrated with what it
sees as the international com-
munity's apathy toward the
suffering on the ground.
On Thursday, the Syrian
National Coalition, an opposi-
tion umbrella group, posted a
statement on its Facebook page
saying 72 bodies had been dis-
covered in the village of Maa-
likiyah, south of Aleppo. It
blamed the purported killings,
which the SNC said took place
on Feb. 25, on Assad's forces,
and demanded that countries
at the Rome conference "take
a serious and firm position on
the regime's crimes, which
continue to cast a dark shadow
of failure and weakness on any
international efforts sought to
provide support to the Syrian
people."
Observatory director Rami
Abdul-Rahman said he had
heard rumors of a mass killing
in the area, but could not con-
firm the reports.
No videos have been posted
online yet showing the after-
math of the alleged killings,
although word and videos in
past cases has often taken days
to trickle out because of the
remote locations and difficul-
ties in gaining access to the
affected areas.
The opposition has also
bemoaned the West's unwill-
ingness to provide rebels with
the arms they need to counter
the regime's superior firepower.

Scientific accessibility
Obama opens up federally funded research to the public
Responding to an online petition posted to the White House's
We the People platform, the Obama administration issued a
memorandum through its office of Science and Technology
Policy to mandate that federally funded scientific research be made
available free of charge to the public within the year. The proposed
policy would centralize and publicize the data sets, methodologies,
results and conclusions from research funded via federal agencies at
institutions with budgets greater than $100 million. Such measures
are in line with the global call for further open access in science, dem-
onstrating the Obama administration's commitment to pushing the
nation's scientific efforts forward. This policy is beneficial to the pub-
lic, scientists and science as a whole and finally lets taxpayers have
access to the information they pay for.

The grie o moving on

0

Knowledge that springs from publicly fund-
ed research belongs to the taxpayers who pay
for it, in the same sense that roads and parks
do. However, the results published in scientific
journals are currently inaccessible to the pub-
lic. Hidden behind exorbitant pay walls, inde-
cipherable language and scattered through
hundreds of repositories, information is guard-
ed instead of dispersed.
However, this policy could go further. The
proposed action places a heavy emphasis
on research in the sciences but fails to con-
sider research in the humanities. Though the
National Endowment for the Humanities, the
nation's largest federal agency that supports
humanities research, favors and intends to
follow the spirit of the proposed expansion
of open access research, the policy would be
stronger if it applied to all research.
In fact, open access to scientific research is
a logical foundation and natural extension of

the current trends toward making education
and knowledge more open and available. Mas-
sive open online courses - where millions of
interested people can receive world-class edu-
cations - would benefit from freely obtainable,
high-quality content. Having direct access to
research allows content creators to craft bet-
ter teaching materials and gives others a way
to use it to create new knowledge.
For the first time in the history of this
country, the direct contents of federally
funded research could be made available to
anyone who wishes to see them. Removing
the barriers to entry will only prove benefi-
cial with time by fostering an open dialogue
between researchers and the general public.
While this proposal should be expanded to
all research, including the humanities, it is
an encouraging sign for a country struggling
over questions of who owns information
and knowledge.

n September, I ducked out of
my feminist theory class to
take a call from my dad, who
had been phon-
ing me every few
minutes.
"Mormor has
lung cancer," he
said as I leaned
against the win- t
dowpanes of j
the wide Uni- EMILY
versity hallway. PITTINOS
"It's bad."
It wasn't a
secret that my grandmother had
mistreated her lungs. She started
smoking at 11 years old in Denmark
and spent the 1970s working as a
carpenter at poorly ventilated con-
struction sites.
"That's just how it is now," my
dad told me. "People are living so
long that everyone's going to get
cancer and die from that."
I stood in Angell Hall surrounded
by students who were reading, tex-
ting and chewing pencils - bored
out of their minds as they waited
for classes to turn over. As I thought
of my grandmother watching the
winter birds feed through her bay
window, I tried not to become "that
girl" - weeping in the midst of a
crowded hallway.
I told him I'd make it up north
soon and hung up.
After immigrating to the United
States, Mormor raised three kids
alone and started several business-
es. She could drink more schnapps
than anyone else I've met. She was
the strongest woman I knew, and
now she was dying.
On the crowded bus ride to my
art class, I realized my grand-
mother wasn't going to make my
wedding dress and repeated the
phrase to myself until a stranger in
a fur hat looked as if she could cry
by osmosis.
This is when I started treating
myself like a victim of her illness.
I'd sulk in my bedroom hours from
home, mourning her last bit of life
over a Styrofoam box of Bibim-
bap and a bowl while my parents

dwelled in the true shadow of her
sickness. They sprinted between
pharmacy, radiology and oncology
and lived in a limbo between diag-
nosis, prognosis, treatment, toilet
and bed. Five times a week, my dad
drove her to radiation - an hour
each way through the snow.
"Doctors treat her like she's
already dead," he said through the
phone in a whisper.
As the months went on, Mor-
mor's list of illnesses lengthened
- strokes, seizures, thrush, pneu-
monia - and my courage in the face
of her deterioration grew. Every
other weekend, I drove four hours
through Flint and frozen farm
country to be with her.
Because much of that time was
spent in the hospital, my dad, sis-
ter, mom and I lived in a circuit
between the cafeteria, a visitor's
room with free coffee that tasted
like shoe polish and Mormor's bed-
side, where we'd catch up with her
many specialists and watch the
Food Network on a small television
mounted on the ceiling above her
bed. The hospital elevator became
a place where I'd manage a moment
to myself, and if a stranger accom-
panied me on the ride we'd stand in
silence as we speculated about the
other's source of sadness.
After a particularly difficult day
at the hospital - she didn't speak or
look into our eyes - my father swal-
lowed tequila; my mother gulped
gin. I sipped red wine and shucked
the shells of frozen crab legs with
my bare hands. There was nothing
else for us to do.
As ice chips flaked onto the cobalt
countertop, I watched them melt
and realized I was already griev-
ing. We all were. Grief's undertow
had taken us while we were caught
in the frenzy of diagnosis and treat-
ment, and now that recovery wasn't
an option we were surprised to find
ourselves already out to sea.
We each treaded water in our
own ways. My mom coped with her
mother's sickness by making diora-
mas with Risk pieces and Inter-
net printouts of medieval villages.

My dad dove into his work, which
was selling instruments out of our
house. I digested feminist theorists
and used candle wax as a metaphor
for cancer in my art projects. My
sister was 10, so I don't know how
she dealt with the imminent loss.
I don't know what she could have
done; Mormor was her third parent
and best friend.
"Grandma has
lung cancer" he
said. "It's bad."
In January, my mom called, and
the next day some family friends
drove me through a blizzard to my
grandmother's house. All evening
we sat weeping by her bedside, and i
she asked me to hold her for a while.
And I did, telling her it was okay
to go. That night, as I knit a hat in
the living room, the dog barked and
she died.
I visited my parents last week-
end, and somehow- maybe because
they didn't have to make hospital
trips or wonder what would hap-
pen next - I expected them to be
relieved within their grief. My dad
told me otherwise.
"It's all still there," he said. "She's
gone, but it's still there. We cry all
the time."
And of course they did, and still
do, but why don't I?
I think my grief is the quiet kind.
I go to class, make art, write col-
umns, go to workand keep myupper
lip stiff, because that's what she'd
have done. My grandmother was a
hard-working warrior of a woman
and, though I miss her stern grace,
I feel at peace knowing I wrung ,
myself out to her before she died.
She didn't leave without knowing
that she taught me how to be strong,
so l can never be without her.

BARRY BELMONT I
The lives of mice and men

Twenty-one years ago, a man named Rod-
ney Coronado firebombed the offices of a
pair of animal research scientists at Michi-
gan State University. In addition to more
than three decades worth of lost research,
the MSU facilities suffered more than $1.2
million in direct damage. Coronado, acting
as part of the Animal Liberation Front, tar-
geted Richard Aulerich, a researcher who fed
minks potentially contaminated food - fish
caught in Saginaw Bay in Michigan - to mea-
sure the effects of polychlorinated biphenyl
pollution in the Great Lakes. Minks were
known to be highly susceptible to food toxins
and thus would show signs of poisoning well
before other animals in the food chain.
Coronado avidly disagreed with using
animals for scientific research and made his
point on the night of Feb. 28, 1992, as he had
many times before - by planting homemade
incendiary devices in the offices of those he
perceived to be wrong.
If the sheer volume of books, articles,
treatises and Internet comment sections are
anything to go by, ethics is a contentious sub-
ject. Because the actions we take matter, and
because our actions are propelled and limited
by what we consider we ought and ought not
to do, our moral opinions have very real con-
sequences. If we think that there isn't such
a thing as private property, theft becomes
hard to dissuade. If we contend that charity
doesn't help people, we might be disinclined
to give to charity. In fact, it's only because our
actions have consequences that the morality
inspiring them matters.
Moreover, the consequences only matter if
they affect the overall well-being of someone
either positively or negatively. The use of the
term "well-being" here is meant to encapsulate
all the thingsothat go into making someone (bio-
logically, psychologically, existentially) happy,
content, fulfilled, etc. It's meant as a catchall
term, like "health," to describe the physiologi-
cal state of biological beings, given the limited
space of our discussion. Thus, the reader will
know what I intend when saying that stealing
in most cases likely diminishes someone's well-
being, whereas being charitable most likely
increases another's well-being. If there were
no effects on well-being, the morality of our
actions would be moot.
It's this consequentialist framework that
surrounds the debates on animal testing for

scientific research. The debate focuses on
whether the methods and results of animal
testing justify the use of animals. The facts of
the matter are that millions of animals each
year are subjected to millions of scientific
experiments, many of which can cause pain
and suffering. Great scientific progress has
been made as a result of these experiments,
alleviating the pain and suffering of millions
of people and animals around the world. How
one sees the balance between the first and
second points is what leads some to feed fish
to minks and others to throw bombs.
Make no mistake - many of us are alive
today because of the efforts of scientists
working with animals. Vaccines for chicken
pox, cholera, diphtheria, influenza, hepati-
tis, measles, mumps, polio, rabies, smallpox
and tetanus, every single medication on the
market, many medical procedures (from
angioplasty to organ transplants) and most
life-saving medical devices (replacement and
artificial organs) all come as a result of tests
first done on animals.
However, many would contend that these
ends - good as they are - don't justify the
means by which they are achieved. What's
taken from animal research, be it from mice,
rats, dogs, cats, monkeys or people, isn't suf-
ficiently balanced by what's gotten out of it.
That is, the suffering (minimal as it may be)
and deaths of animals are too high a price to
pay for the value achieved, just as stealing
doesn't make all parties involved richer (and
in fact makes us all poorer).
Our relationship with our fellow animals
(are we not merely mammals?) must be estab-
lished if we are to properly gauge the benefits
and detriments of our actions to them and for
ourselves. Should we consider them property,
meaning that we can do with them whatever
we'd like? Should they be given rights, forc-
ing responsibilities unto beings incapable
of understanding them? These are difficult
questions that need answers if we're to ever
to increase the overall well-being of all rel-
evant subjects.
The borders of our morality need illumi-
nation, and it's with the light of reason - not
from the flames of terrorists - that we'll con-
tinue to find them.

Thawing the diplomatic ice

Next week, John Kerrythe recent-
ly confirmed U.S. Secretary of State,
will embark on his maiden overseas
trip. During the trip, he will visit
nine countries in 10 days throughout
Europe and the Middle East. Among
the countries he will visit are two
that are critical to long-term stabil-
ity in the Middle East: Turkey and
Egypt. The two countries are major
power players and currently sit at a
crossroads in their diplomatic rela-
tions with Israel - the United States'
central ally in the region. During
his trip, Kerry should work hard to
set the stage for improved relations
between these two countries and
Israel in order to serve the best inter-
ests of those who desire long-term
stability in the region.
Kerry will be visiting Turkey,
which has experienced frosty dip-
lomatic relations with Israel ever
since the Turkish-supported Gaza
Flotilla incident in May 2010, in
which radical anti-Israel extrem-
ists and terrorist members attacked
Israeli soldiers. While Israel has
since made efforts to normal-
ize relations with Turkey, those
efforts have been largely rebuffed
by the nation and Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In advance
of Kerry's visit, Israel has recently
sent Turkey several signals that
it hopes to push their diplomatic
relationship in a more positive and

productive direction.
Israeli defense firm Elta recently
decided to deliver $100 million of
equipment for Turkish Airborne
Warning and Control Systems.
This equipment will enable Tur-
key to better defend itself against
airborne threats through the radar
system that it provides. By sending
over this equipment, Israel signals
that it supports Turkey's efforts
to protect itself from threats to its
national security. Additionally,
Israel has recently offered to lay a
natural gas pipeline through Tur-
key to Europe. This pipeline would
surely provide longterm economic
benefits to Turkey and could very
well be lucrative for both countries.
However, the Turks have yet to
respond to this offer. If Kerry can
convince Turkey to accept Israel's
pipeline offer as a signal that they
hope to work towards positive and
mutually beneficial relations, it
would be a huge step in the right
direction for the region.
In Egypt, Kerry approaches a
slightly more complicated situation.
Still dealing with the after-effects
of a revolution during the Arab
Spring, Egypt's internal politics and
power structure are hardly stable.
As a result, it may be difficult to con-
vince Egyptian leadership to make
any long-term decisions regarding
foreign affairs. Kerry can work to

establish a sounder Egypt by pro-
moting rule of law and respect for
human rights with government
officials. Such efforts will further
legitimize Egypt's current regime
and enable them more flexibility to
take on ambitious efforts in foreign
affairs. A stronger Egypt will hope-
fully be empowered to promote the
rule of law along the Gaza border,
which could vastly improve Israel's
long-term outlook for peace. While
Egypt and Israel have seen their
relationship become more com-
plicated since an Islamist govern-
ment was elected in Egypt, whose
leader has been recorded delivering
anti-Semitic rants, they still share
a mutual interest in promoting the
rule of law. In Egypt, these efforts
will better the Morsi regime's grip
on power internally, and in Israel,
they will go a long way toward pro-
viding stronger national security.
Kerry has a long list of priori-
ties during his first trip overseas.
He will also be meeting with criti-
cal U.S. allies such as Germany and
Saudi Arabia during his trip, and
must build his relationship with
diplomats in those nations as well.
However, his visits to Turkey and
Egypt can and should set the stage
for a joint pursuit of long-term sta-
bility in the Middle East.

This show should be shot ... down.
'Ben Show' an
immature borefest

Party bus.
'Bully' offers a moving
reminder to stand up

Comedian
0 Ben Hoffman can't
deliver the jokes
By EMILY BODDEN
Daily Arts Writer
Ben Hoffman doesn't deserve
his own television show. Yet
"The Ben Show" debuted
Thursday, Feb.
28 at 10 p.m.
How the show
has made it to a The Ben
debut is a mys- Show
tery.
The format Thursdays
doesn't really at 10 p.m.
make sense. As
a combination Comedy Central
of "Tosh.O"
and "Da Ali G Show," "The Ben
Show" cannot compete. It lacks
the humor that Daniel Tosh,
while majorly offensive and a
bit of a dick, manages to find
in his commentary on the clips
he presents. And Ben Hoffman
is no Sasha Baron Cohen of "Da
Ali G Show."
Each episode follows Hoff-
man as he attempts to perform
a task interspersed with unre-
lated clips. For instance, in the
first episode, the plot follows
Hoffman as he decides whether
or not he should buy a gun. The

whole premise is ridiculous and
doesn't elicit laughs. Hoffman
asks for advice from a variety of
sources: a gun shop owner, his
dad and a penis enlargement
specialist. But he's neither sin-
cere nor sarcastic enough for it
to work. Instead, each interview
seems forced and uninspired.
While Hoffman boasts some
impressive credentials, he
doesn't deliver. He's had bit
parts in "New Girl," "Drunk
History" and "Arrested Devel-
opment," and has written for
some other Comedy Central
shows. So, the potential is there,
but it's just too deeply buried
beneath bad jokes and poor
taste to expose itself.
There is confusion about the
actual dynamic of Hoffman and
his guests. The interviews don't
flow naturally: He jokes with
some of the guests, telling them
to compliment his last sketch,
but instead of coming off as
endearingly geeky, his jokes
are agitating after the first time
they're said. It's unclear if the
interviews are scripted or if
they're just that uncomfortable.
Hoffman's dad is the sole
beacon of hope for the show. In
every episode, he and Ben Skype
to discuss that week's goal. His
father appears to be in his six-
ties and dons thick glasses
that cover half of his face. He's

sweet and a saint for having to
deal with his son's shenanigans.
With every prodding, he simply
laughs and shakes his head. His
father sometimes even plays
along. If anyone on "The Ben
Show" deserves to have his own
show, it should be Hoffman's
dad.
That being said, the only
laugh earned in the first two
episodes occurred in the first
episode ("Ben Buys A Gun"),
but was then cheapened by a
similar sketch in the second.
The scene involves a person,
who's probably classified as
morbidly obese, walking along
a crosswalk. With every step,
Ben plays a deep note on a tuba.
While childish and (quite hon-
estly) dumb, the sketch appeals
to immaturity and social inap-
propriateness. It lasts less than
a minute, which might prevent
the viewer from realizing how
cheap of a laugh it provokes. If
only the entire show could be as
short.
Perhaps the entire series will
follow this pattern as well and
get canceled. This show doesn't
cater to immature 12-year-old
boys, nor is it brimming with
intellectual wit for the, more
sophisticated audiences. Hope-
fully Ben Hoffman finds his
funny or else a second season
might not be in the cards.

Daily B-Side Editor
I remember the smirk on his
face, that look of utter smugness
framed by arrogant eyes, breath-
ing malicious confidence into
everything he said. To be honest,
it didn't really matter what came
out of his mouth. Repetition's
deliberate pace had calcified
words like "fag," "cocksucker"
and "retard" into an everyday
reality. It was the way he said
them - with a sense of entitle-
ment weighted behind every syl-
lable.
The shoving didn't start until
after my brother tried to tell him
to back off. I guess it caught him
offguard. Did this "queer" really
think he deserved the right to
defend himself? How could he?
But a point had to be made. So,
the bully took my brother by the
collar, pressed his face against a
garage door and started punch-
ing. He didn't stop until there
were tears.
I just stood there.

DailyArts Writer
When I began listening to
Rilo Kiley, I immediately added
it to the list of bands I needed
to see in concert. I was accord-
ingly heartbroken - like a small
kid after his dog dies - when
heard the band had broken up,
and Rilo Kiley was no more.
No more?! How could it be!
No more soulful riffs from
Jenny Lewis? No more twangy
guitar solos? No more charming
duets with vocalist Blake Sen-
nett? No more breakup songs to
sing in the car too loudly on the
way to high school?
Sennett even admitted in
a 2011 interview that if Rilo
Kiley were a human being, "he's
probably laying on his back in
a morgue with a tag on his toe.
Now, I see movies where the
dead get up and walk. And when
they do that, rarely do good
things happen."
I gave a silent eulogy for the
loss of the excellent Rilo Kiley
and tried to move on with my
l life.
Well, until Feb. 19, when a
miracle occurred. The once-
dead Rilo Kiley clawed its way
out of its grave and declared that
the band would indeed walk
again. Not only are the band

they're releasing a new record,

Never forget 'Gigli Never forget.
Academy fails at
re-invention once again

By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
The phrase that springs to
mind when thinking about
this year's Oscars is: "Trying
too hard." To which I'd like to
add: "And failing." Getting a lot
of people to watch something
while staying true to the craft
is an arduous task, even for
the greatest film directors, let
alone an award show. Which is
why it's time for the Academy
Awards to decide whether they
want to be respected or enjoyed
because, as Sunday night
proved, trying to achieve both
is no easy feat.
Let's dissect Sunday's show
step by step, starting with the
host. Needless to say, even at
his most classy, Seth MacFar-
lane is a prick. But that's what
the world expects the creator
of "Family Guy" to be; that's
why we were so excited about
the prospect of him making
this show both approachable to
"the younger demographic" the
Academy so desperately tries
to please and exciting in the
nerdy-cool way reminiscent of
Andy Samberg's contributions
to "SNL." But MacFarlane was

neither, and his few crude jokes
were too tasteless to be memo-
rable or funny. After years of
trying new things (the disas-
trous memory of Anne Hatha-
way and James Franco's hosting
still lingers ... ), it's clear there
can only be two good kinds of
Oscar hosts.
The most successful hosts to
date have been Academy veter-
ans, showmen like Steve Martin
and Billy Crystal who look out
into the audience and see the
face of an old friend instead of
can't-joke-about-the-legend-
himself Robert DeNiro. The
other great kind of host is a
complete outsider - the Ricky
Gervais - who doesn't give a
crap about what DeNiro thinks
of him, anyway. Which is exact-
ly where MacFarlane, who's
close enough to the film indus-
try to care but not close enough
to insult, failed. Perhaps the
Oscars need to come to terms
with the fact that, with the
exception of film buffs, people
don't generally care about who
wins an Academy Award (we're
going to go see "The Avengers"
regardless), and that the efforts
to make them more approach-
able are fundamentally futile.

Clearly, choosing a good
host wasn't the only thing that
befuddled the Academy this
year. The show brought talking
teddy bears and 1970s musicals
together in the most confusing
way possible. Boob songs were
followed by ballroom danc-
ing. The awards themselves
were more indecisive and skit-
tish than some of MacFar-
lane's worst punchlines of the
night. Affleck didn't garner a
Best Director nomination, but
"Argo" won Best Picture; "Life
of Pi" wasn't even considered
to be a legitimate Best Picture
contender, but Ang Lee won
Best Director. Even the techni-
cal awards were almost evenly
divided and distributed among
Best Picture nominees so that
no one left the room a loser.
It's time to
forget the
ratings and
focus on quality.*

Trying to be unpredictable
was the Academy's most predict-
able move Sunday night, and it
meant sacrificing the core prin-
ciples around which the award
show is built. Picking a winner
is a subjective process, even
the Academy knows that, but,
in my opinion, it seems like the
point of these awards has been
to reward the daring movies
and performances that not many
would otherwise pay attention
to. Which is why "Argo" 's win
seemed forced - a consolation
prize handed to Ben Affleck as
an apology for his missing Best
Director nomination. In truth,
almost every other movie in that
category was as good, if not bet-
ter than "Argo."
While Jennifer Lawrence is
adorable and deserving, her win
seemed forced, too, and against
the Academy's better judgment.
Do't get me wrong, I love J-Law.
But if these awards were happen-
ing a decade ago, Emmanuelle
Riva or Jessica Chastain would
have won. The Academy that
picked the nominations and the
Academy that picked the winners
could not be more polarized.
Perhaps we can say that the
Academy is undergoing a mid-
life crisis. For the past five
years, it has struggled with re-
inventing itself and becoming
more accessible to the masses.
But there are only so many ways
of re-inventing the wheel before
one realizes that it can only be
round. Just like how the Oscars
will always be about moviemak-
ers looking pretty, awarding
each other, making fun of them-
selves and pretending like the
world has nothing better to do
than to watch them fake-smile
for four hours.
And if that's the case, the
only way the Academy has to re-
establish its integrity is to ditch
the ratings and stop handing
out consolation prizes. There
will never be an Oscar winner
that everyone approves of, but
the Academy can certainly go
back to choosing the daring,
overlooked filmmakers who
define the industry as much as
any billion-dollar blockbuster.

Wolverines need sweep

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson started this week
of practice, the program's last
ever in a CCHA regular season
before the Big Ten hockey con-
ference starts next season, by
addressing his
team. Ferris State
"You've got ,
to play for us at Michigan
and finish the Matchup: FSU
season strong," 15-13-4; Michi-
Berenson said gan 12-8-2
near center ice. When: Friday
"The fun part and Saturday
is in the locker 7:35 p.m.
room after the Where: Yost
game." Ice Arena
He was
referring, of TV/Radio:
course, to the CBS College
Wolverines'
tradition of
singing "The Victors" in their
locker room after series sweeps.
And entering into what Beren-
son referred to as "absolutely"
the most importantgames of the
season - a two-game set against
Ferris State this weekend -
Michigan could badly use all six
points that hang in the balance
before the CCHA playoffs begin
next weekend.
The Wolverines don't control
their own destiny to host a first-
round series at Yost Ice Arena,
but that possibility becomes far
more realistic if Michigan could
sweep. It's extremely unlikely
the Wolverines would play at
home in the first round without
a sweep.
"I just hope we play at home,"
said Berenson, who added he'll
have his eye on the around-the-
league scoreboard. "That's our
first goal. We'll see where the
smoke clears. You look at all the
options this weekend -a lot of

per, Lindsay Sparks, Kevin
Lynch, captain A.J. Treais and
defenseman Lee Moffie.
"It's going to be pretty sad,"
Moffie said of playing what
could possibly be his last games
ever at Yost. "We don't really
like to talk about it, the guys
in my class. It's gone by so fast,
especially this year."
Added Treais: "It's going to
be a little depressing, sad. This
has been my home for the past
four years.
"I love playing here and, it
potentially being my last two
games here, they're going to be
pretty emotional."
Berenson said he hopes the
team will one day look back on
this year's senior night as the
2010-11 team can as then-senior
forward and current New York
Ranger Carl Hagelin scored the
game-tying goal in regulation's
final minute before sealing the
win in overtime with another
tally.
To be in the games late,
though, Michigan will need
to shut down the CCHA's top
power-play team. During these
teams' earlier meetings in Big
Rapids on Nov. 30-Dec. 1, the
Bulldogs struck twice on the
man advantage the first night in
their 5-0 rout of the Wolverines.
In the series finale, the penalty
killers came alive and Michigan
held the Ferris State power play
scoreless in a 3-3 shootout win.
Berenson said Friday night
will be especially important
to set the tone for a successful
weekend to honor the seniors
and possibly spring Michigan in
the standings.
"That series (against Ferris)
was part of our worst part of our
season," he said.
"The way we approach this
(first) game - this game is the
weekend."

Michigan looking to keepE
momentum over road trip

By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
After an inauspicious start to
the season, the Michigan base-
ball team responded by record-
ing its first victory, as well as
its first series victory, against
Fordham last weekend. But for
the Wolverines, the challenge
will be sustaining this newfound
momentum during their upcom-
ing10-day road trip.
Michigan (2-4 overall) will
travel to Florida to play five
games in the Snowbird Invita-
tional before heading to Califor-
nia for the USD Tournament to
finish the trip. In total, the team
will play a total of nine games
over a 10-day stretch.
As the Wolverines return to
Florida, they hope to continue
their offensive momentum from
last weekend. Over the course of
four games, they have scored 32
runsi off of 40 total hits. A big fac-
tor in getting those runs was first
getting quality at-bats.
"They did a great job," said
Michigan coach Erik Bakich.
"We got a lot of quality at-bats
got a lot of big hits, a lot of two-
out RBIs.Weseparated ourselves
with some big at-bats."
Another factor in the offense
was the aggressive base running,
led by freshman infielder Travis
Maezes - who is a perfect 6-for-
6 in stolen bases for the season.
Michigan has a total of 19 steals
insevengames andhas onlybeen
caught stealing once.
This total has come without
arguably the team's most dynam-
ic base stealer, senior outfielder
Patrick Biondi, who's been lim-
ited to one steal this year. Biondi
is currently second all-time in
career steals at Michigan with 89
and only needs one to tie the all-
time record.
"Pat is a tremendous base
stealer, he's very gifted in that
category," Bakich said. "I know
his stolen-base numbers don't
reflect that yet, but he's aguy that
at the end of the year, he's going
to have anywhere from 30 to 50
just depending on the opportuni-
ties."

Junior catcher Caitlin Blanchard is seen as a possible starter behind the plate for Michigan's seven games over break.
Softball back on the road

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Senior outfielder Patrick Biondi needs one steal to tie Michigan's all-time record.

A bright spot for the Wol-
verines during their first two
weekends has been their pitch-
ing. Without a true ace at their
disposal, they've relied on the
efforts of sophomore right-
hander James Bourque, senior
right-hander Ben Ballantine and
freshman left-hander Evan Hill.
The Wolverines also took the
opportunity to showcase some
new pitchers, givingthem much-
needed game experience. This
should prove to be extremely
valuable since Michigan's pitch-
ing depth is likely to be tested on
the extended road trip.
"We got some guys in there
that had not pitched in college to
log quite a bit of innings, so that
was good," Bakich said.
At the Snowbird Invitational,
Michigan will take on Mount St.
Mary's, Saint Louis, and George-
town, followed up by a non-tour-
nament with Florida Gulf Coast.
The Saint Louis and Florida
Gulf Coast games are likely to
be the toughest challenge for the
Wolverines. Saint Louis returns
almost all key contributors from
a team that made an appearance

in the NCAA regionals last year,
while No. 23 Florida Gulf Coast
is coming off a weekend sweep of
No. 13 Florida.
"It's going to be a great chal-
lenge for us, we have to abso-
lutely stay locked in game by
game, inning by inning, pitch by
pitch and keep winning pitches,"
Bakich said. "I know this team
will keep fighting, that's the one
thing they will do, which is fight
till the very end, which is a good
sign."
After Monday's game against
Florida Golf Coast, Michigan
will travel to California to pre-
pare for the USD Tournament.
While in California, the Wolver-
ines will participate in a team-
building activity with U.S. Navy
SEALs at their base in Coronado,
Calif., much like the activity the
Michigan football team's seniors
underwent last summer.
"It will be a great opportunity
for us and a great experience,"
Bakich said. "It should be a great
couple of weeks where we can
continue to get better and con-
tinue to rack up some great wins
for Michigan."

Spartans to invade Crisler Behind Enemy Lines:
MSU coach Tom Izzo

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan men's basketball
team's season-defining stretch
was supposed to be the four games
between Feb. 2 and Feb.12 - three
road games, three games against
ranked opponents: Indiana, Ohio
State and Michigan State. It was
supposed to be a showcase of dom-
inance, swagger and style.

more telling
than their previ-
ous tough set of games.
Michigan (10-5 Big Ten, 23-5
overall) still has two games
against the Big Ten's top two
teams - No. 9 Michigan State and
No. 1 Indiana - and though it's all
but out of the race for the confer-
ence title, Michigan is still play-
ing for a top-four seed in the Big
Ten Tournament and a high seed
in the NCAA Tournament later
in March. So this stretch might
be more telling than the previous
one.
The Wolverines host the Spar-
tans (11-4, 22-6) on Sunday, and
though Michigan State put a 75-52
drubbing on Michigan in East
Lansing on Feb. 12, the Spartans
are on a small slide of their own.
Michigan State has dropped its
past two games, and both coaches
are concerned about the way their
teams have been playing recently.
"We didn't play with the same
energy in the last couple games
that we need to play with," said
Michigan State coach Tom Izzo

in a Monday teleconference. "This
week, we're going to work on get-
ting back to who we are and what
the program stands for because
we didn't guard like a team needs
to guard in the last three games."
Added Michigan coach John
Beilein: "We played like we had
two pianos on our back at Michi-
gan State, that was the one that
was most glaring to us. After the
Wisconsin loss, we weren't acting,
we were reacting too much. We
had to just go out and make the
cuts that we make. ... We empha-
sized in practice, 'This is our style
of play, let's go back to it."'
Though the Spartans have
faced stiffer competition in Indi-
ana and Ohio State, their back-
court has struggled offensively as
well. Point guard Keith Appling,
who played well against Michigan
while keeping sophomore guard
Trey Burke in check defensively,
has gone on a dry spell in recent
games.
Appling has tallied nine com-
bined points on 2-of-14 shooting in
the past two games and the junior
hasn't done a great job distribut-
ing the ball, recording just six
assists. He typically averages 13.4
points per game - he's the team's
leading scorer - and four assists
per game.

But freshman guard Gary Har-
ris has stepped up in Appling's
scoring absence. Harris has shot a
50-percent clip from the field and
has led Michigan State in scoring
its past two games. The freshman
hit five of his nine 3-pointers in
the Spartans' win over Michigan,
and Izzo has acknowledged Har-
ris's impressive showing with the
team's inconsistent play as of late.
For Michigan, turnovers have
become an issue as of late. Soph-
omore guard Trey Burke, who
averages 1.9 turnovers per game,
coughed the ball up a season-high
six times against Penn State. As a
whole, the Wolverines committed
15 turnovers, compared to the six
they had the first time they faced
the Nittany Lions.
Also, Burke hasn't gotten the
offensive help of his teammates in
recent games. The sophomore has
dominated each of the past three
games offensively - scoring 18, 26
and 19 points, respectively - and
the Wolverine frontcourt, with
a healthy Jordan Morgan, hasn't
produced like it did at the begin-
ning of the conference season,
especially in rebounding. With
the sophomore at the helm of the
offense, protecting the ball down
the stretch and grabbing boards
will help Michigan maintain a

lead and close outgames.
"It is a cardinal sin heth to turn
the ball over in practice," Beilein
said. "If I look atthe Big Ten over-
all, I think every team really takes
care of the ball. It's essential to
winning, just like rebounding -
it's an extra possession, either
offensively or defensively, (and) so
is alack of a turnover. It's an extra
possession for you."
Despite the recentslide for both
teams, the matchup on Sunday is
a must-win of sorts for each team
- Michigan State can keep its
sights on a Big Ten championship,
and Michigan will add a resume-
boosting win over one of the best
teams in the nation. But as both
Izzo and Beilein noted, if either
the Spartans or Wolverines want
to stop their recent slides, they'll
have to get back to playing their
style of play.
"If you can't get up for No. 1
in the country (Indiana), if you
can't prepare to play your best
basketball, then something's not
motivating in your ticker, there's
something missing," Izzo said.
"We did play well against Michi-
gan (on Feb. 12), but since then,
we've had some issues that we've
had to deal with. Now we can get
back to doing things the way we're
supposed to."

After a loss to Penn State,
which was previously winless in
the Big Ten, Michigan has even
more to prove on Sunday when
Michigan State, which beat the
Wolverines by 23 earlier this
month, comes to town.
Spartan head coach Tom
Izzo knows a thing or two about
beating Michigan, and after the
game in East Lansing, he said
that his team had an "axe to
grind." A sweep over the Wol-
verines wouldn't just give the
Spartan fans bragging rights, it
would keep their team within.
striking position of a Big Ten
title for the second-consecutive
year and fourth time in five
years.
Izzo sat down with the Daily
at Big Ten Media Day in Octo-
ber, and had some choice words
for his rival.
The Michigan Daily: Every-
one's tied for first place right
now, all at 0-0, but at the end
of the year, who do you think
comes out on top?
Tom Izzo: What a loaded
question. You're right, every-
one is in first place or last place
- depends if you're optimistic
or pessimistic. But I think Indi-
ana has deserved its ranking
and I think that the league has
deserved that there's five other
teamsin the Top 25. Some (rank-
ings) have four in the top-10. I
think that's all deserved in the
preseason hype. The problem
is, last year we were not in that

group and we won the league
and were a No. 1 seed. There's
always surprises. If you look at
Indiana, they've got guard play,
they've got the best inside guy,
they've got a great coach and
now they've added the depth.
They've also had players that
have hit rock bottom, those guys
that played their freshmen and
sophomore years - the (Jor-
dan) Hulls and the (Christian)
Watfords of the world - and
got stomped on for a while. Last
year, they started stomping
back, and if they continue that,
I think they are the preseason
favorite and deserve to be.
TMD: In terms of the Michi-
gan and Michigan State bas-
ketball programs, is this the
highest level you've seen them
at together, at the same time, in
your tenure?
TI: In my time as ahead
coach, I'd say that it is. We were
down, they were down - we'll
see though. There's time. One
or two years doesn't make that,
either way - it didn't make it
for us when were the ones com-
ing up. I don't think it makes it
for anybody, you know. We'll
see how people handle success,
including us, and we'll see how
you handle failure, but I'd say
right now, it's at thehighestlevel
it's been because we have two
teams ranked and everybody's
top 15 and it's been a while since
that happened. Maybe when I

In their last night at Crisler, seniors carry Michigan

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
This wasn't just another free
throw. For senior guard Jenny
Ryan, it was the last shot she
would ever take on the Crisler
Center floor.
Ryan swiftly sunk the basket
as she's done throughout her
123 appear-
ances as a N-WESTERN 50
Wolverine, MICHIGAN 55
but this
time she took an extra second,
stepped back and took it all in.
A rare moment for the captain of
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team, Ryan, who typically
has an intense demeanor, took on
a different expression - one of
reflection.
"At those moments, it kind of
hits home that this it," Ryan said.
In their final home game, the
Wolverines' five seniors ensured
their swan song wouldn't be
spoiled by Northwestern.
They imposed their domi-
nance on offense, accounting
for 52 of the Wolverines' 55 total
points. The Wildcats (5-10 Big
Ten, 13-15 overall) attempted
to make a late run but couldn't
overcome 18 turnovers, failing to
Michigan, 55-50.
An emotional night for the
Wolverines' seniors began with a
ceremony that honored the grad-
uating class, but the tears and
sentiments were pushed aside
until the final buzzer sounded.
Meanwhile, Michigan (9-6, 20-8)
pounded the ball into the post
to collect 34 points in the paint.
Though Northwestern won the
rebounding battle, it struggled
from the field, shooting just 37.7
percent from the floor.
"I thought we played well in
spurts, and I thought we strug-
gled in spurts, but it was nice to
be able to grind one out," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "It was really an impor-
tant night for our senior class
and there were alot of emotions.
As a coach, you always try to
eliminate distractions on a night
like tonight, but you really can't
do a great job of that."
Senior forward Rachel Sheffer
controlled the post for the Wol-
verines, scoring a team-high 17
points along with six rebounds.

9

Senior guard Jenny Ryan scored 12 points and had eight assists in her last game at Crisler center. As a whole, the seniors scored 52 of Michigan's 55 points.

Ryan contributed her fair share,
finishing with 12 points and
eight assists on the night.
Completing her seventh dou-
ble-double of the season, senior
guard Nya Jordan scored 11
points and grabbed 11 rebounds
against the Wildcats.
Northwestern's freshmen for-
ward duo of Maggie Lyon and
Lauren Douglas helped lead the
Wildcats back into the game
on a couple of impressive runs.
Lyon, who had been named the
Big Ten Freshmen of the Week
for the past three weeks, scored
18 points and gathered seven
rebounds in the contest.
After a back-and-forth first
half that saw Michigan go on
an 8-0 run only to be answered
by a 7-0 Northwestern run, the
Wolverines went into the locker
room holding a 24-21 lead.

Out of the break, Wildcat for-
ward Kendall Hackney scored
two consecutive baskets to fuel
Northwestern's offensive charge.
The Wolverines responded
though, distributing the basket-
ball and allowing their seniors to
battle for the lead.
Sheffer sparked a 9-0 run by
converting eight points from
offensive rebounds, but the
Wildcats were persistent.
Northwestern managed to
spark a 15-5 scoring streak with
less than 10 minutes left, cut-
ting the Michigan lead to three
points. Yet it was Michigan's
leader, Ryan, who knocked down
four late free throws to edge out
the Wildcats.
"Northwestern has grown so
much as a team throughout the
Big Ten season," Sheffer said.
"They started a little rocky, but

they are a really good team. They
definitely put it to the pedal
tonight. We had some moments
where we were a little shaky, but
to come out and grind it out was
really big for us."
At 9-6 in the Big Ten, the Wol-
verines no longer control their
own destiny in the conference
standings.
After two consecutive losses
coming into Thursday night's
game, Michigan must now jostle
with four other teams to earn a
bye in the first round of the Big
Ten Tournament.
"We won the game on senior
night, but I think we're more
excited because we bounced
back off a couple of losses," Shef-
fer said. "We got more momen-
tum going into Ohio State and
the Big Ten Tournament."
Even if the Wolverines don't

receive a first-round bye in the
upcoming conference tourna-
ment, this season has been far
from disappointing. Thurs-
day's victory over Northwest-
ern marked yet another record
for this season's team as Barnes
Arico broke the record for all-
time program wins as a first-year
head coach.
The seni6r class has done
something that no other team in
program history has been able
to accomplish - take Michigan
women's basketball to an elite
level.
This season, the Wolverines
have already accomplished the
program's best start while crack-
ing the Associated Press Top 25
for the first time in 10 years.
"Our goal coming in was
always just to leave the program
better than we found it," Ryan

TERRA MOLLENGRAFF/Daily
said. "That progressive climb
has led us to where we are. I'm
not surprised as to what has hap-
pened because of all the hard
work over the years from every-
body, but we're happy where it's
at now. "
So while their basketball
careers at Michigan aren't yet
completed, the seniors were
able to join Ryan in a moment of
reflection.
And even if this was their final
game at Crisler Center, the lega-
cy of the Wolverines' graduating
class surely won't be forgotten.
"(The seniors) are going to
have one of the best legacies
ever - one of the best four years
that has come through Michi-
gan women's basketball," Barnes
Aric said. "This senior class
really put Michigan's women's
basketball on the map."
