Group claims
state law enacted
last month is
unconstitutional
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The American Civil Liberties
Union of Michigan filed a law-
suit in federal court in Detroit
yesterday challenging the con-

stitutionality of a law Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder signed into
law last month that prevents
public employees from receiving
domestic partner benefits.
The ACLU filed the suit on
behalf of four couples in domes-
tic partnerships. Still, after he
signed the bill, Snyder said pub-
lic university employees would
be exempt from the ban. While
some University officials agree
the legislation should be over-
turned, they expressed relief
that domestic partner benefits

can still be offered to University
employees.
In a press conference in
Detroit today, Michael Stein-
berg, legal director of the ACLU
of Michigan, said the only aim of
the legislation is to take rights
away from LGBTQ couples in
the state, the Detroit Free Press
reported.
"This law was designed with
one purpose in mind and that
was to strip away health insur-
ance coverage from same-sex
couples," Steinberg said.

In a statement on Dec. 22 fol-
lowing the passing of the bill,
the University said while it still
didn'tbelieve inthe implications
of the bill for state employees, it
was pleased with the amend-
ment protecting University fac-
ulty.
"While we strongly urged a
veto of (the bill), we emphati-
cally agree with the governor's
analysis that the provisions of
the law do not apply to state
university employees," the

A new year and a new owner
will bring a fresh look to Stuc-
chi's on South State Street.

Local businessman Jim Seta
bought the Stucchi's location
last month. Seta, who also owns
the Dexter Stucchi's, said while
"renovate is a strong word," big
changes are taking place at the
shop to encourage community
building including alterations to
the store's interior and the intro-
duction of new products.
Seta said he felt the old inte-
rior of the store "wasn't as wel-

coming as it should be," and the
remodeling plan aims to include
an Ann Arbor-themed mural
near the front of the store and
chalkboards for customers to
draw on.
Another addition is a multi-
colored sprinkle bar for cus-
tomers to enhance their ice
cream treats. Seta added that

Pentagon chief says a smaller
military creates extra risksTj

Obama's new
defense strategy
designed to contend
with budget cuts
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Qbama vowed yester-
daythe United States willmaintain
the best-equipped military in his-
tory despite deep and looming
defense budget cuts, but Pentagon
leaders acknowledged the changes
present additional risk.
"Our military will be leaner,
but the world must know the
United States is going to main-
tain our military superiority,"
Obama said in a rare appearance
in the Pentagon briefing room.
Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta and several top mili-

tary brass lined up on the stage
behind him, underscoring Penta-
gon support for cuts that Panetta
and others said they know will be
criticized as too drastic.
Obama said the emerging strat-
egy overhaul is designed to con-
tend with hundreds of billions of
dollars in budget cuts and refocus
the United States' national securi-
ty priorities after a decade domi-
nated by the post.-Sept. 11 wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
The strategy, devised through
a comprehensive review by civil-
ian and militaryleaders, centered
on the military the country needs
after the "long wars of the last
decade are over," Obama said.
Panetta said that smaller mili-
tary budgets will mean some
tradeoffs and that the U.S. will
take on "some level of additional
but acceptable risk." But Panetta

said that at this point in history,
in a changing world, the Penta-
gon would have been forced to
make a strategy shift anyway.
He says the money crisis merely
forced the government's hand.
The president announced that
the military will be reshaped
over time with an emphasis on
countering terrorism, maintain-
ing a nuclear deterrent, pro-
tecting the U.S. homeland, and
"deterring and defeating aggres-
sion by any potential adversary."
Those are not new military
missions, and Obama announced
no new capabilities or defense
initiatives. He described a U.S.
force that will retain much of
its recent focus, with the excep-
tion of fighting a large-scale,
prolonged conflict like the newly
ended Iraq mission or the ongo-
ing war in Afghanistan.

The parents of Jaime Gonzalez, stepmother Noralva Gonzalez, left, and Jaime Gonzalez Sr., speak in front ofttheir home in
Brownsville, Texas yesterday. They are demanding to know why police officers fatally shot their 15-year-old son.
Texas school shooting leaves *
many questions unanswered

NIK VOW:

Parents wonder
why police shot
their son who had
pellet gun at school
BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP)
- On a doorstep outside a fam-
ily home, a father wondered why
police had to shoot his son in the
hall of the boy's middle school.
In an office across town, a police
chief insisted that his officers
had no choice.
And scores of others in this
Texas border city wondered:
Could the death of 15-year-old
Jaime Gonzalez have been pre-
vented?
A day after police fatally shot
an eighth-grader who was bran-
dishing a realistic-looking pel-
let gun, his anguished parents
pleaded for answers, demanding
to know why police didn't try
a Taser or beanbag gun before
resorting to deadly force.
In front of the family home,
the father lamented his loss and
called on authorities to explain
their actions.

"Why three shots? Why one
in the back of the head?" asked
Jaime Gonzalez Sr.
Some standoffs with police
last three or four hours, he said.
This one "took not even half an
hour."
But Brownsville interim Police
Chief Orlando Rodriquez said
the preliminary autopsy report
showed the boy was not shot in
the back of the head.
There was broad agreement
among law enforcement experts:
If a suspect raises a weapon and
refuses to put it down, officers
are justified in taking his life. The
shooting also raised questions
about whether pelletguns should
be marked in a way that would
easily distinguish them from real
handguns.
Rodriguez defended his offi-
cers, saying the younger Gon-
zalez pointed the pellet gun at
police and repeatedly defied their
commands to put it on the floor.
He said the boy was shot twice
in the torso. Asked about the par-
ents' suggestion that there had
been a shot to the back of the
head, Rodriguez said, "It's a lac-
eration as a result of the fall."

The Brownsville Herald,
which reviewed the report, con-
firmed the preliminary finding
that the boy died of two gunshot *
wounds, one to the chest and
one to the abdomen. The report,
signed by pathologist Elizabeth
J. Miller, noted Gonzalez had a
laceration to the right side of the
head consistent with a fall.
Officers spoke with the boy's
parents yesterday and exchanged
information with them, Rodri-
guez said.
Authorities also released a
911 recording from Cummings
Middle School. The assistant
principal on the phone first says
a student in the hall has a gun,
then reports that he is drawing
the weapon and finally that he is
running down the hall.
On the recording, police can
be heard yelling: "Put the gun
down! Put it on the floor!" In the
background, someone else yells,
"He's saying that he is willing to
die."
Before police arrived, school
administrators had urged Jaime
to give up the gun. When officers
got to the school, the boy was
waitingfor them, Rodriguezsaid.

Bing optimistic
city won't run out

Detroit is no longer at risk
of running out of cash by April
because cost-cutting and other
measures are taking effect,
Mayor Dave Bing said yesterday,
but the city council president
and others do not share Bing's
optimism.
Bing presented a financial and
operational restructuring plan
update to the council yesterday
afternoon. It highlights cost sav-
ings from 1,000 imminent lay-
offs, overdue payments from the
Detroit Public Schools district
and a corporate tax increase he
says will mitigate a cash short-
fall.
The 18-month plan calls for
$102 million in savings through
June and $258 million over the
2013 fiscal year. Auditors had
previously warned Detroit could

women are significantly less

said. "The fact that some of the
women up for re-election are
vulnerable ... I don't think it's
because of their sex, I think it's
their state."
Stahenow's re-election vul-
nerability is often tied to Michi-
gan's economic difficulties. Matt
Williams, a Stabenow campaign
spokesman, wrote in an e-mail
interview that Stabenow's re-
election campaign will focus
largely on "transforming our
economy to create jobs (and)
standing up for Michigan in a
global economy."
Stabenow was first elected to
the Senate in 2000 and she has
raised more than $5 million for
her re-election effort.
In a November interview with
the Detroit Free Press, Stabenow

If implemented, the bill would
allow for several exchanges with
varying levels of health coverage.
The most extensive plans would

The health care bill could pro-

of University graduate students
who are currently uninsured,
according to Robert Winfield, the

"When I came into the U.S.
Senate in 2000, it was the first
time there were enough women
in the Senate to have a woman

told the Free Press. "Now we
have five women chairing com-
mittees. The first challenge is,
having women become part of
the process by running for office.
Then it's about being able to
move up and get clout and have
the power to get things done."
Despite the focus on gender
differences in politics, Law-
less said there is no difference
between what a woman must do
to remain in office and what a
man must do.
"It's about representing his

"We don't know what the
bronze, silver, gold and platinum
(levels of insurance) will look
like for our state, but it may be
less expensive for a student to
buy a good quality policy - gold
or platinum - than to purchase
the policy now offered," Winfield
said.
Winfield added that the legis-
lation is important for all unin-
sured citizens, not just uninsured
University students.
"I believe that having as many
people uninsured in our country
as we have is not justifiable and
anything we can do to address
the problem of the uninsured and
the underinsured is something
I'm in favor of," Winfield said.

In November, University
President Mary Sue Coleman

"Fortune 500 companies

It is simply good business that

In addition to the design

prime minister for second term

from Queen
KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP)
- Portia Simpson Miller was
sworn in for the second time
as Jamaica's prime minister
yesterday, pledging to ease its
deep poverty, boost the sput-
tering economy, heal political
divisions and sever colonial-era
links with Britain.
Simpson Miller, whose
1 -year-long first stint in office
ended in 2007, took the oath of
office before roughly 10,000
guests on the grounds of the
rambling, colonial-style man-
sion that is the official residence
of the governor-general.
The 66-year-old politician
scored a dramatic victory in
last week's national elections,
leading her slightly left-lean-
ing People's National Party to
a 2-to-1 margin in Parliament
over the center-right Jamaica
Labor Party. Her opposition
faction won a dominating 42
seats in the 63-seat legislature,
leaving the incumbent party
with 21.
The plainspoken, charismatic
Simpson Miller, this Caribbean
island's first female prime min-
ister, takes over from Andrew
Holness, a 39-year-old Labor
lawmaker who was leader for
just over two months.
"After being tested and tem-
pered, I stand before you today
a stronger and better person
prepared to be of service to my
country and people," Simpson
Miller said at the start of a spir-
ited 45-minute speech.
She said her government

intends to abandon the British
monarch as Jamaica's official
head of state, and instead adopt
a republican form of govern-
ment. Jamaica declared inde-
pendence from Britain in 1962
but remains within the Com-
monwealth and has Queen Eliz-
abeth II as head of state.
"I love the queen; she is
a beautiful lady," Simpson
Miller quipped, before speak-
ing to the audience in Jamai-
can patois: "But I think time
come."
Simpson Miller also said
she will replace the Privy
Council in London with the
Trinidad-based Caribbean
Court of Justice as Jamaica's
highest court of appeal. She
said this will "end judicial
surveillance from London."
She vowed her government
will "ease the burdens and the
pressues of increasing pover-
ty, joblessness and deteriorat-
ing standards of living" while
also pursuing a tight fiscal
policy and forging strong
partnerships with the private
sector and international part-
ners such as the International
Monetary Fund.
"My administration will
work tirelessly that while
we try to balance the books
we balance people's lives as
well," Simpson Miller said.
Jamaica is a cash-strapped
island with a punishing debt
of roughly $18.6 billion, or
130 percent of gross domestic
product.
In the short- and medium-
term, the prime minister said
her administration will use
"state resources" to stimu-
late jobs through the Jamaica
Emergency Employment Pro-
gram, a centerpiece of her
party's campaign manifesto.

Her People's National Party
said it will try to renegotiate
roughly 25 percent of a troubled
$400 million road program
financed by China in order to
transfer some of the money to
the emergency employment
program as a way to kickstart
the economy.

Closing time in Detroit
Police must ensure precincts serve residents
Detroit is considered one of the most dangerous cities in the
nation. A recent decision by the Detroit Police Department
will close certain precincts within the city to the public from
4 p.m. to 8 a.m. every day. The closings cause a concern for the safety
of Detroit residents. If residents truly don't use the precincts during
those hours and don't have a legitimate need for them, closing the pre-
cincts for a large part of the day may save Detroit a significant amount
of money. However, before a decision that could negatively affect citi-
zens is made, police officials should conduct thorough research with
the safety of the community in mind.

reassess his presidential campaign following his fifth place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
A we ll-rounded edcto

Detroit Police Department precincts and
districts in certain parts of the city will be
closed to the public from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m.
every day beginning on Monday. Several
clerical jobs, including report clerk, desk
clerk and timekeeper, will be eliminated. The
officers currently holding these positions
will be returning to street patrol. The pro-
gram is scheduled to be expanded city-wide
next month.
Before deciding to eliminate 24-hour pre-
cincts, the city should conduct comprehen-
sive research to determine if there is a need
for them. If residents use the precincts and
want them open all the time, the city should
not close them. The purpose of the police
force is to protect and serve the commu-
nity. If residents feel they need a precinct to
be open for 24 hours a day, then they have a
right to have that service.
The police department has proposed
a switch to virtual precincts. The idea of
switching to virtual precincts has the poten-
tial to be a viable solution. If the technology
is in placeforresidents to file complaints and,
perform other tasks online instead of at a
physical precinct, the option could prove to

be a money-saver for the cash-strapped city
of Detroit.
It's commendable that Detroit is not com-
pletely eliminating the jobs at the shuttered
precincts. Returning officers to the street
serves as a win-win situation for residents
and officers. Since Detroit is a dangerous city,
more street patrols could deter crime and
increase the safety of residents. These officers
will also stay employed, so they won't add to
Detroit's already high unemployment rate.
Closing Detroit police precincts has both
positives and negatives. The hours of the day
when the precincts will close tend to be when
most crimes occur, so the virtual precinct
system should be flawless before it's imple-
mented. If the safety of Detroit residents is
compromised in any way by closing the pre-
cincts, they should remain open around the
clock. Though residents will not be able to
receive services at the physical locations, the
move will place officers back on the street,
where they can better protect residents. If
the residents of Detroit want the precincts
to remain open for 24 hours,,and have dem-
onstrated a need for it, they should have that
right.

ver break, I caught up
with a friend of mine who
hails from Australia. After
reminiscing
for some time
about the high
school years she
spent living in
my hometown
in Maryland,
we moved on
to share sto- LEAH
ries about our
respective col- POTKIN
lege experienc-
es. We compared
everything from American and
Australian bar culture to classroom
dynamics. Aside from the differ-
ences in drink and sport preferences
- she prefers Crown Lager and soc-
cer while I'm partial to Sam Adams
and American football- what most
surprised me was her genuine
shock (bordering on disdain) that
a university as prestigious as ours
offers classes beyond the core aca-
demic curriculum typically associ-
ated with "university" studies in
the Down Under. In this case, I was
referring to a meditation and con-
templative practice course I had just
completed.
As she explained, her course
choices in Australia are much more
limited, and classes are more focused
on preparing students for specific
professions or vocations. Her expla-
nation indeed highlights a con-
tinuing quandary for students. It's
difficult to find a balance between
core academic and vocational cours-
es intended to better prepare stu-
dents for immediate entry into the
work world, and alternative and cre-
ative courses, which contribute to a
well-rounded and fulfilling college
experience.
Supporting the argument for
a more focused curriculum is a
study released earlier this week by
Georgetown University's Center on
Education and the Workforce, which
reported a11.1% and 9.4% unemploy-
ment rate for recent college gradu-

aces with degrees in the arts and
humanities, respectively. only grad-
uates with architecture degrees, a
field which was significantly and
negatively impacted by the housing
bust, had a higher rate of unemploy-
ment. And while these results might
be expected considering the coun-
try's current economic state, the
numbers for unemployment of grad-
uates with more technical degrees
did not suffer to the same extent.
Despite my friend's disapproval
and the results of such studies, stu-
dents should still be encouraged
to take courses that are not strictly
academic in order to balance their
schedules and expand their minds
- ideally in ways which will assist
them with their core courses and
future endeavors.
In the same way football players
can benefit fromtaking ballet classes
to improve performance on the field,
University students can benefit from
taking arts and humanities classes
in order to get them thinking in new
ways and with different parts of
their brain.
In addition to taking creative
classes to find balance, University
students should be encouraged to
take classes in creative areas that
interest them because of the oppor-
tunity to learn in the amazing,
highly recognized programs the
University has to offer. Moreover,
while the benefits of a more struc-
tured academic curriculum maylead
to more success in the job market
immediately after graduation, there
certainly is no guarantee that such
directed studies will lead to long-
term happiness or fulfillment.
Further complicating the discus-
sion of the potential benefits of tak-
ing classes outside the core academic
curriculum is the supposition that
such classes are what students deem
"easy A" classes. Students take these
electives in order to inflate their
GPAs, and while higher-level arts
classes are most certainly difficult,
some lower level and less conven-
tional ones - such as the meditation

course I took - indeed deserve the
"easy A" identification, something
nearly every student looks for when
scanning websites such as ratemy-
professor.com. While some students
may, in fact, elect to take such class-
es solely with the intention of get-
ting a good grade, many others do
not, and if the end result for either
party is exposure to, or appreciation
of, a new subject, then the motiva-
tion for taking the classbecomes less
important.
Classes outside a
core curriculum
can be beneficial.
With a new semester just under
way, students shouldn't take the
endless benefits of exploring areas
outside their core curriculum for
granted, and they should take cre-
ative classes in conjunction with
strictly academic ones. Though such
creative courses may not pay imme-
diate dividends in the "real world" as
compared to more directed technical
business or engineering courses, the
application of materiallearned in cre-
ative classes could very well be more
practical and fulfilling in the post-
college world outside the work arena.
So, while strict academics and
soccer might be the norm Down
Under, a balance of less convention-
al classes and strictly academic ones
- along with, of course, football -
should be accepted as the norm both
here in the United States and at the
University specifically. So long as
the University continues to give stu-
dents the flexibility to choose their
courses, students should be encour-
aged to make their selections with-
out fear of limitingnthemselves in the
job market.

CHAYSON HURST 1 VIEWPOINT
The rise of Groupon-care

When your first thoughts upon waking up
range from "How in the world did I get here?"
to "What happened to me last night?," don't
laugh it off with your friends and joke about
the drunk texts that may have been sent the
previous night. Blacking out has become a
serious issue on college campuses across the
nation, and it's now being viewed ass a'normal'
part of the college experience. More than half
of college students that drink alcohol report
having blacked out at least once in the previ-
ousyear, accordingto a Northwestern Univer-
sity study in 2011. But an even scarier thought
is the fact that as more students experience
blackouts, we are desensitizing ourselves to
the dangerous and serious nature of the situ-
ation.
Blacking out mainly occurs from one of
the three following reasons: drinking too
much too fast, not eating a large enough meal
before drinking or beingunder a large amount
of physical or mental stress. All of these are
common here on campus, where students are
constantly running around without adequate
meals and proper nutrition while they're also
overwhelmed from the stress and workload
that tough University classes create. In addi-
tion, the social scene at frats, bars and Satur-
day pre-parties does nothing to help curb the
binge drinking that so many college students
find themselves a part of. It is the common
associationwith social drinkingthathas made
blacking out a new norm here on campus.
In reality though, it's anything but normal.
Not to be confused with passing out from
too much alcohol, blacking out is actually a
type of amnesia. An individual who enters a
blackout state suffers from memory loss that
can last anywhere from 10 minutes to several
hours depending on that individual's situation
and past alcohol history. In this state, alco-
hol interferes with neural synapses and leads
to disruption in the formation of long-term
memories. This makes it impossible to have
any recollection of the previous night's festivi-
ties the next morning, and it's extremely scary
for the individual involved.
Blacking out is definitely not something to

laugh off and joke about in the morning when
you can't remember how you got home (if you
did), what you were doing for those three and
a half hours and where you managed to lose
your credit card, ID and cell phone. Blacking
out has become a dangerous trend in our com-
munity that can lead to injury, sexual assault,
unprotected sex and, often times, regret. Poor
decisions are made under the influence of
large quantities of alcohol and can't be remem-
bered in the morning when the time has come
to deal with the consequences and fix the
damagethat was done. This vicious cycle leads
to immense stress, anxiety and even depres-
sion if the blacking out occurs often enough.
It is a growing trend among college students
today that has taught us it's okay to blackout
when drinking, and it's even a fun goal to aim
for. The next time you hear someone yell, "I'm
getting blackout tonight," take a second to ask
if they truly understand what they're saying.
Binge drinking on college campuses is
ancient news, butthe increase in students who
are blacking out needs to stop. It's not worth
the stress, regret and embarrassment in the
morning when the previous night is one giant
blur. We were all intelligent enough to get into
the University, so it's time to start acting like
it and drop the mindset that blacking out is a
socially acceptable behavior. As a community,
we need to educate each other on the negative
consequences associated with blackouts and
how dangerous they can actually be to one's
health. We need to change our mindsets and
realize thatblackingout isn't all it's crackedup
to be, and is in fact quite the opposite.
So the next time you're out with friends -
whether you're casually sipping a beer, cel-
ebrating a 21st birthday or raging hard - just
remember to drink responsibly, watch out for
one another and eata decent meal beforehand.
Let's try to start acting like the responsible,
intelligent students that were accepted to the
University in the first place. Don't we want
to remember as much of our undergraduate
experience as possible?

ver Winter Break, while
browsingthe Web, I noticed
that the Internet discount
giant Groupon now offers coupons
for medical procedures. It's clear
many Americans who don't have
health insurance find these deals
appealing, but is relying on Grou-
pon for medical procedures a viable
alternative to conventional health
insurance?
The first deal I found was a teeth
cleaning for $39. Groupon also
listed full eye exams for $29. Both
deals boasted hundreds of dollars
in savings compared to the project-
ed normal cost of the procedures.
It didn't shock me that these deals
were available because many Amer-
icans don't have dental or vision
insurance - even I don't have cov-
erage for those. What scared me
most, however, were the multiple
discounts for full medical check-
ups. One deal offered an examina-
tion for only $69 - it even included
blood and urine testing.
But it doesn't stop there. There
were even listings on Groupon for
LASIK eye surgery at the unbeat-
able price of $2,100 per eye! That's
a 58 percent discount according to
Groupon. These are just a few of
the many deals on medical proce-
dures that can be found on the site.
In fact, according to an Associated
Press article, DealRadar.com - an
online coupon finder - found that
one out of every 11 deals offered
online last year were discounts on
medical procedures.

As an aspiring pre-med student,
I'm all for finding ways to make
health care more affordable, but,
using online deal sites like Groupon
scares me.
For one, many of the business-
es offering deals on Groupon are
doing so to advertise their compa-
ny or practice. The idea is simple:
If potential customers, clients or
patients come in and enjoy their
experience, they are more likely to
come back for additional services.
Eventually, those coupons for
$29 eye exams will be extremely
hard to find. When that happens,
former coupon patients will either
be forced to pay the full price of the
procedure out of pocket, or forego
the procedure altogether. Both of
these are unfortunate options. It's
important to remember that like
other businesses, ophthalmologists,
dentists and every other medical
professional can't sustain services
that are significantly discounted in
the long run - they'd go bankrupt.
It's dangerous to rely on cou-
pons because they're inconsistent.
For example, if you get a cavity and
your "health insurer" is Groupon,
the only option you have is to go
online and hope that a nearby den-
tist is offering discounts on fillings.
If you can't find such a discount,
then you go without.
One final potential problem is
the constant movement from one
health professional to another. It's
unlikely to see the same doctor that
offers a $69 checkup offer another

discounted procedure one year
later. If you want another checkup,
you will need to purchase the most
affordable discounted checkup that
you can find, which will likely be
with a different doctor.
Entire medical records are not
quickly transferred from one office
to another. One needs to fill outa lot
of paperwork and questionnaires at
both offices to facilitate the trans-
fer. Unpredictable things can hap-
pen that could hinder the care you
receive. Maybe you forget to men-
tion an allergy, or perhaps previous
relevant symptoms that could help
your current doctor quickly diag-
nose a problem slip your mind on
a given visit - there is real reason
why many healthcare professionals
claim consistency leads to better
care.
In all, Groupon can help bridge
gaps in one's medical insurance, but
online, discounted procedures are
not a solution to America's health
care problems. The system isn't
reliable enough to be the primary
source of care a person receives.
Perhaps a more viable option is for
sites like Groupon to offer coupons
for conventional health coverage,
like a discount on six months of
coverage from established insur-
ance companies. Hopefully the
future holds better healthcare solu-
tions for all Americans. Until then,
I'm off to get my teeth cleaned for
$39.

loving Dr. Watson (Jude Law,

but brilliant Professor Moriarty
(Jared Harris, "The Ward").
Ritchie's decision to have his
Watson be a stabilizing force
for Holmes (like Jackie Chan to
Chris Tucker in "Rush Hour")
as opposed to a foil for Holmes's
explanations was a wise one.
This Watson is a character all
his own, creating a sort of crime-
solving-duo dynamic enjoyable
to watch.
Moriarty is a Hannibal Lect-
er-like villain and his scenes
with Holmes are the highlights
of the film. One moment in par-
ticular features Moriarty madly
screaming as Holmes remains
stoic. This shows the difference
in their geniuses, but aside from
this short portrait, Holmes never
truly displays that calm again. It
would serve Ritchie well to bring
out this side of Holmes more
often, to create a more monk-like
hero.
A common theme in "Shad-
ows" is the concept of muddy-
ing the waters to catch a fish.
Ritchie has certainly kicked up a
lot of mud in this second install-
ment with explosions, gunshots,
cheap, laughs and"slkwmotion.
Sometimes it works, sometimes
it doesn't. Hopefully there is a
third film, and hopefully Ritchie
displays more restraint that time
around.


Nothing new to see in 'Zoo'

By BRIANNE JOHNSON
Daily Arts Writer
To the delicate souls of impas-
sioned readers: Seek shelter
behind the remains of skeletal
Borders shelves. Blacken my
words with splashes of that half-
finished chai latte, or smother
your retinas with the heat of the

If not solidified by the success
of hits like "Sex & the City" and
"Dexter," the recent swarm of TV
titles featuring one key phrase -
"based on the book by..." - seems
to signify that screenwriters
are rushing to rip scripts from
the bindings of best-sellers. But
what is it about recent television,
spawning cult followings from
"Game of Thrones" to "The Vam-
pire Diaries," that so successfully
intertwines the page and the
screen?
Freed from the confines of
viewers' waning attention spans,
television is allotted the depth
that the books' built-in fan bases
expect, yet the movies fail to
deliver. The Blair Waldorfs (orig-
inally of Cecily von Ziegesar's
"Gossip Girl" series) retain the
"villain" quality that is so often
a one-dimensional staple of Hol-
lywood, while simultaneously
complicating with each episode,
constructing a character with
motives, secrets and shames. As

There's a reason some movies
are released during the holiday
season. There's
a certain kind of
shallow, mod- *'
erately pleasant
entertainment We Bought
that's just right a Zoo
for the whole
family. Not that AtQuality 16
the whole fam- and Rave
ily will enjoy 20th Century Fox
it, but they at
least won't be
offendedby it. Director Cameron
Crowe's ("Almost Famous") "We
Bought a Zoo" is one of these. It's
pleasant enough to watch, but
presents nothing challenging,
stimulating or original.
Matt Damon ("Contagion")
stars as Benjamin Mee, an adven-
ture-addicted magazine writer
with two kids who is mourning
the death of his wife. After his
son Dylan (Colin Ford, "Push")
is expelled from school, Benja-
min decides it's time to start over.
on an impulse, he buys a dilapi-
dated zoo in the countryside and
decides to renovate it with his
family and the zoo's diminished
but loyal staff.
Unfortunately, "We Bought a
Zoo" offers no surprises. Within
the first 20 minutes of the movie,
each story and character arc has
been neatly set up to be followed
to its predictable conclusion. Ben-
jamin will fall in love with the
beautiful head zookeeper Kelly
(Scarlett Johansson, "Iron Man
2"), Dylan will fall in love with
the cute, young zoo employee Lily
(Ele Fanning, "Super 8") and the
old, sick tiger whose life is only
sustained by the medication Ben-
jamin insists on giving him will
become a metaphor for Benja-
min's own struggles dealing with
his wife's death. It's all too easy,

and we've seen it all before.
The story hinges on Benja-
min's goal of re-opening the zoo
in a few short months. This turns
out to be a nearly impossible task,
and he comes up against various
obstacles - his complete lack of
knowledge of zoos, a strict inspec-
tor intent on Benjamin's failure,
fights with his son and his inabil-
ity to recover from the trauma of
his wife's death. The problem is,
the audience doesn't feel what
these characters are feeling. Since
we're a safe six months out from
Benjamin's wife's death, we never
feel the same sense of loss that
affects him and his children. And
the reasons for Benjamin's quar-
rels with his son are never fully
clear. The movie rabidly avoids
intensity, preferring instead to
simply amble along. It's sort of
funny, and sort of sad and sort of
pretty, but not enough to really be
captivating.
"We Bought a Zoo" also lacks
subtlety. Characters deliver lines
about being free and letting go,
and you can almost see the film-
makers winking at you. The
soundtrack, a glossy combination
of pop hits and packaged inspira-
tion, tells the audience just how
to feel at all the right times. The
cuteness of Benjamin's daughter

Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones,
"Footloose") is beaten over the
audience's head until she feels less
like a character than a device to
illicit sympathy. You would have
to be unconscious to leave this
movie feeling or thinking any-
thing other than exactly what the
filmmakers wanted you to think
and feel.
We bought a
boring movie.
Since the ending of the movie
can be easily determined from the
beginning, the film's final third is
bereft of tension. Instead of wor-
rying about what will happen to
these characters, the audience
must simply gaze at their beauti-
ful faces as they go about their
pleasant work. The movie looks
right, and has all the right mov-
ing parts, but a strong story never
emerges from among the fine per-
formances and the pretty images.
In the end "We Bought a Zoo" is
a vapid movie, a passable family
film for the holidays, but one for-
gotten as soon as one leaves the
theater.

football team this semester.
Linebackers Kaleb Ringer and

Hoke said it was the players'
decision to enroll and that he
didn't encourage them to do so.
"They just were able to," Hoke
said. "We didn't push any of
them to come early.

Hoke did mention that it obvi-

the players football-wise, given
that they will have extra tinte

Greg Mattison's system.
But there are other advantag-
es, too.
"From an academic stand-
point it's as important as any-
thing when you don't have the
pressure of a season going on,"
Hoke said.

Six days ago, No. 13 Michi-

earlier in the season, took down
Wisconsin, 72-65.
Three nights later, the Bad-
gers (1-2 Big Ten, 12-4 over-
all) lost a 63-60 overtime
heartbreaker to Michigan State.
Wisconsin almost managed to
erase a 7-point deficit in the last
30 seconds of the extra frame
when Badger guard Ryan Evans
banked in a 3-point heave to tie it
at the buzzer. But as it turned out,
the game clock above the back-
board wasn't aligned with the
other clocks posted in the arena
and the basket was waved off.
"That's the correct ruling,"
said Michigan coach John
Beilein. "Unfortunately, the
clocks weren't in sync. Now
which one is the right one? Is
one running slightly ahead or
is one running slightly behind?
The way I understand the rule,
it's what's ever on that back-
board. If that light goes up,
that's the one."
The call sealed the Badgers'
third home loss of the season
and gave them their worst Big
Ten start since 2002.
After a slow start to his sea-
son; senior point guard Jordan
Taylor has scored 20 points per
game in Big Ten play, dropping
28 on the Spartans on Tuesday.
He also dishes out nearly five
assists per game and boasts a 3:1

graduation of Jon Leuer and
Keaton Nankivil. He averages
12 points and five rebounds per
game.
"They're a really good team,
they're tough," said senior guard
Zack Novak. "We know we got a
big challenge coming."
Michigan (2-1, 12-3) took care
of the Big Ten bottom dwellers
in its first two games before fall-
ing to Indiana last night, 73-71.
Sophomore forward Tim
Hardaway Jr. has struggled with
his shot recently, and the Wol-
verines have had to count on
other players for scoring.
Though Hardaway Jr. had a
team-high 19 points on Thurs-
day, only one of his field goals
wasn't a layup and he missed
two crucial 3-pointers in the
final two minutes.
Over the last two games, he
is 9-for-33 from the field and
has missed his last 12 3-point
attempts. But on Wednesday, he
didn't appear fazed by his shoot-
ing struggles.
"You got to go out there and
get reps if your shot isn't fall-
ing," Hardaway Jr. said. "Just

Against Minnesota on Sun-

Burke took on the scoring load,
making 8 of 11 shots and notch-
ing a career-high 27 points inthe
Wolverines' 61-56 victory.
And on Thursday, while
Burke and Hardaway Jr. were
drawing iron all evening, senior
guard Stu Douglass knocked
down three 3-pointers and red-
shirt sophomore center Jordan
Morgan made six of his seven
field goal attempts.
Sunday, when the Badgers
come to Crisler Center, the Wol-
verines won't be able to afford
a bad shooting day. Wisconsin's
ability to work the shot clock leads
to longer possessions and Michi-
gan tends to adapt to the tempo of
the opposition. This means fewer
possessions for both teams, and
the Wolverines will need to capi-
talize on their chances.
"Wh'e got to com1back,

combined 3-for-15 from the field at
the half. And at times, it seemed as
though the thunderous crowd was
getting to Burke, but Michigan
coach John Beilein did not think
that was the case.
"I thought he was fine," Beilein
said. "He didn't look like a fresh-
man to me.... He had pull-up jump
shots that didn't go, and they were
right at the back of the rim. They
weren't air balls, they weren't to
the side, they were right on cen-
tral. Taking the ball to the hoop
against a strong chest, it's tough
to score there. I thought he played
well, the ball just didn't go in."
Though Hardaway Jr. finished
with a team-high 19 points, he is
now 0-for-11 from 3-point range
over the pasttwo games. Had it not
been for Douglass's pair of clutch
3-pointers in the waning minutes
of the half, Michigan's outlook at
the locker-room break would have
been a bit gloomier. The second
half was kinder to the Wolverines.
Michigan inched its way back
into the contest, pulling within
one point just four minutes into
the half. And a minute later, soph-
omore forward Evan Smotrycz
nailed a 3-pointer in front of the

Wolverine bench to knot up the
score at 46 apiece and silence the
Hoosier faithful - temporarily.
"I hope that's always a great
trademark of our teams now,"
Beilein said. "I hope it's not a
trademark to be down by two dig-
its. I thought we really hung in
there.."
Over the next few minutes,
though, the Michigan defense had
trouble containing star freshman
center forward Cody Zeller, who
took advantage of the shallow
Wolverine frontcourt. He finished
an impressive 8-for-10 from the
field, with 18 points.
"That was the biggest part
of the game plan," said Indiana
coach Tom Crean. "We had to
establish an inside game - we
had to go at these guys. They were
averaging two blocks a game with
(sophomore forward Jon) Horford
injured. So we needed to go inside,
and our guys did that."
Though the Wolverines erased
another10-point deficit withthree
minutes to play on a Hardaway Jr.
breakaway dunk, Michigan failed
to take the lead and became the
Hoosiers' 11th-straight victim at
Assembly Hall.

16 Michigan rid-
ing a wave of momentum heading
into this weekend's series with
Lake Superior State.
But it's still not all smiles - at
least, not yet. Even though it won
four of its last five games, Michi-
gan (5-6-1 CCHA, 11-8-3 over-
all) currently sits at eighth in the
CCHA. According to Michigan
coach Red Berenson, the weekend
will be important for the team to
prove that its GLI win wasn't just
a "fluke," and that it can indeed
contend with the best of its confer-
ence.
"You can dig yourself a hole and
there's not much of a cushion in
the bottom of that hole," Beren-
son said. "We've got to dig ourrway
out of where we were. Everyone
we're looking at in the upcoh-
ing weekends is ahead of us in the
standings, so we've got to make up
ground."
Making up ground becomes
easier for the Wolverines when
they can compartmentalize the
year. For players like fifth-year
senior goalie Shawn Hunwick,
the new year essentially feels like
a new season - and this seasonis
the one that really matters.
"The first half is over (and) th'e
guys have to be excited for the
opportunities ahead," Hunwick
said. "You want to have a nice sec-
ond-half run. You're not going to
remember the first half of the year,
you're going to remember how

you've finished."
Michigan kicks off its second-
half run against No. 18 Lake
Superior State (7-6-1, 12-8-2) in
the first home series of 2012. The
fourth-place Lakers sit comfort-
ably toward the top of the CCHA.
Though four points separate them
from the Wolverines, the two bear
a striking resemblance.
The Lakers and Wolverines
have similar margins of wins and
losses over the same schools. They
both boast reliable goalies - Hun-
wick and Lake Superior State's
Kevin Kapalka have save percent-
ages of .917 and .916, respectively.
Even the top scorers for Michigan
and the Lakers - freshman for-
ward Alex Guptill and junior for-
ward Nick McParland - are only
separated by one goal, and they
bothhave accumulated 16 points.
But the Wolverines have to
work harder to play catch-up. Lake
Superior State wasn't plagued with
a seven-game winless streak like
Michigan was this season.
Berenson said Michigan hasn't
spent time discussing measur-
able achievements, like how many
points players should be putting on
the boards or the number of games
needed in the win column.
The Wolverines aren't lament-
ing any mistakes they may have
made back in October or Novem-
ber, either.

But Berenson still needs to stop
his players from reverting back
to detrimental patterns from the
first half. Instead, he's put focus on
bringing the team back to what he
calls "Michiganhockey" - playing
strong defense and aggressively
chasing after the puck.
"Hockey is a habit," Berenson
said. "(You have to) repeat good
patterns. Right now I think our
team is more in good habits than
we are bad. Our team is starting to
come together (and) I like where
we are." C
For Hunwick, a return to Mich-
igan hockey has more to do with
self-assurance than anything else.
The pressure on Michigan for
a strong "second season" run isn't
unfamiliar - two years ago, the
team's NCAA tournament berth
was only made possible by their
winningthe CCHATournament.
Hunwick prefers not to look too
far down the road. But with this
series being just one of three that
the Wolverines will host at Yost Ice
Arena, Berenson knows Michigan
has to make an early statement
to maximize the few home-ice
advantages it has left.
"You make the most of whatever
(the schedule) is," Berenson said.
"We didn't help ourselves at home
(duringthe firsthalf).You've gotto
find ways to win and take advan-
tage of your home games."
