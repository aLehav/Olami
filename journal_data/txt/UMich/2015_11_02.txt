Michigan stops 

Minnesota at half-
yard line on final 
play to win, 29-26

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

MINNEAPOLIS — It came 

down to one play, a few inches 
and a lesson Jim Harbaugh 

hopes his players carry with 
them for the rest of their lives.

After a goal-line stand on 

the game’s final play, the No. 15 
Michigan football team escaped 
TCF Bank Stadium with a win 
over Minnesota, 29-26.

“It feels tremendous for the 

way the players played, and a 
phenomenal learning experi-
ence for our men to be able to 
win a tough one,” Harbaugh 
said. “It’s a great learning expe-
rience because it reinforces 

everything you tell them about 
never giving up and fighting ‘til 
the end.”

With 19 seconds remaining, 

Golden Gophers’ quarterback 
Mitch Leidner connected with 
Drew Wolitarsky for 22 yards 
and what looked like a go-ahead 
touchdown. But a booth review 
showed that Wolitarsky’s knee 
touched at the half-yard line, 
forcing Minnesota to hurry back 
to the line and try to punch it in.

The clock began running 

as the Golden Gophers made 
a formation shift, splitting a 
receiver out wide to pass after 
initially lining up in a running 
formation. Leidner’s throw was 
incomplete, though, and by the 
time the ball hit the ground, 17 
seconds had run off the clock. 
Just two remained.

Trailing by three, conven-

tional wisdom would have told 
Minnesota to kick a field goal. 
But in an emotional contest

Crisler Center hosts 
10th annual Army vs. 
Navy matchup to kick 

off Veteran’s Week

By EMILY ROBERTS

For the Daily

The Crisler Center played host to 

a different kind of basketball game 
on Sunday.

Instead of the Michigan men’s 

basketball 
team, 
wheelchairs 

glided up and down the court dur-
ing the 10th annual Army v. Navy 
Wheelchair Basketball Game.

The teams are co-ed and made 

up of experienced wheelchair 
basketball players, as well as Uni-
versity student veterans, ROTC 
students, and occasionally, local 
law enforcement. Sunday’s game 
ended with a 45-40 Army victory.

Gerald Hoff, the event’s founder 

and an insurance representative at 
the University Health System, said 
the game aims to raise awareness 
about living with a disability.

“The 
Wheelchair 
Basketball 

game is the only University-spon-
sored disability related sporting 
event,” he said. “This event show-
cases the skills of people with dis-
abilities; it showcases the ability 
within disability.”

Run entirely by volunteers, the 

event also featured performances 
by several student groups along 
with the game, including the Men’s 
Glee Club, the Michigan Dance 
team and the Michigan Cheer 
Team.

The game is also part of Veter-

ans Week at the University, which 
includes several panels covering 
the experiences of veteran as well 
as appreciation events.

Jerry Sarasin, a long-time wheel-

chair basketball player and instruc-
tor who played for the Army team, 
said the win had been a long time 
coming for his team, which had lost 
in the past few years.

Sarasin added that many char-

acteristics of the game, like pacing, 
are very similar to a game played by 
able-bodied teams. He noted that 
part of the value of hosting this 
event is also demonstrating that 
similarity to the University com-
munity.

“If more people came out to 

the games, wheelchair basketball 
would really grow as a sport, we 
know this because the sport is huge 
in places such as Europe,” he said. 
“There are other colleges that have 
wheelchair teams, and it’s sad that 
athletes have to go out of state to 
play at the collegiate level.”

Kinesiology senior Jon Mendi-

celli, president of the University’s 
Student Veterans Association, said 
he always enjoys playing in the 
games.

“The real wheelchair basketball 

players do a great job of getting all 
of us to play as a team, and making 
us look good on the court,” he said.

Mendicelli, a Marine Corps vet-

eran, played for the Navy team. He 
said the game was important for 
student veterans, especially those 
with disabilities.

“Disabilities often come with 

a stigma, but at this game we can

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s chapter 

of the Lambda Theta Alpha 
Latin Sorority, Inc. concluded 

annual celebrations for LatinX 
Heritage month Friday night 
with its fourth annual Dia de 
los Muertos Ball.

In partnership with the 

office of Multi-Ethnic Stu-

The aim of the ball is to 

educate students about the 
history and cultural traditions 
of Dia de los Muertos and cel-
ebrate the work of the LatinX 
Heritage planning committee.

Dia de los Muertos, which 

translates in English as “Day

Hundreds of people streamed 

in and out of the Michigan Sta-
dium on Sunday as part of the 
fifth annual “Be a Hero at the Big 
House” blood drive, an event that 
kicked off the 34th annual Wol-
verine vs. Buckeye Challenge for 
Life.

The blood drive competition 

will run until Thanksgiving and 
encourages people to donate 
blood and register as organ 
donors in competition with Ohio 
State University. Last year, the 
University beat OSU in registered 
organ donors by 43,857 people, 
but collected only 2,298 pints of 
blood to Ohio State’s 2,414.

FORTY-EIGHT YEARS AGO THIS WEEK, NOV. 4 1967
Library extends hours

ARTS & CR AF TS

Director 
of 
University 

Libraries Frederick Wagman 
announced that the Shap-
iro Undergraduate Library 
would 
extend 
its 
hours, 

remaining open to students 
until 2 a.m. each night for a 
trial period later that year.

The library was previously 

only open until midnight dur-
ing the week. Wagman esti-
mated that it would cost an 
additional $20,000 per year 
to keep the library open for 
those extra two hours.

Before a date for this trial 

period could be set, Wagman 
said the University would 
have to find both additional 
funds and employees to work 
the added two hours. He also 

mentioned that to attract the 
necessary 
employees, 
the 

library would offer workers 
$2.00 per hour for the after 
midnight hours instead of the 
usual $1.55 per hour.

Wagman also said they 

still have to consider possibly 
limiting use of the library to 
only one floor after midnight 
and only allowing books to 
be checked out before mid-
night. This would cut costs 
and make it easier for them 
to keep the library open for 
those additional two hours.

In 2012, the University 

announced the library would 
remain open at all hours. Pre-
viously, it had closed at 5 a.m.

Sixteen years ago this 
week (Nov. 2, 1999)

Members of the Univer-

sity’s solar car team returned 
home from Australia after fin-
ishing ninth out of 40 teams 
in the World Solar Challenge 
in Australia.

Solar 
car

from 

around the world competed 
in the 1,864 mile race through 
the Australian outback. The 
race tested the endurance of 
each team’s solar car and last-
ed for a total of five days.

“Being in the top 10 of the 

world is a pretty good place 
to be in,” team leader Jed 
Christiansen said at the time.

Cotton candy mishap leads to 
new way to model scar tissue

‘U’ team uses sugar 
mold in testing how 
the body responds 
to internal scarring

By DESIREE CHEW

For the Daily

Just before Halloween, the 

University announced that an 
unsuccessful attempt at making 
cotton candy inspired the dis-
covery of a new bioengineering 
technique.

A University team, led by 

Biomedical Engineering Prof. 
Shuichi Takayama, announced 
in a press release last week they 
discovered a new method to 
model extra-soft silicone for cell 
research.

The team’s project studied scar 

tissue formation in soft-celled 
organs like the lung and liver, as 
the body recuperates from inter-
nal scarring caused by diseases 

such as diabetes and cancer.

“In 
general, 
our 
research 

group is concerned with using 
small tools to understand what 
happens in the body, by doing the 
experiments outside the body,” 
said Engineering graduate stu-
dent Joseph Labuz, a member of 
the team. “This project works on 
measuring the forces exerted by 
cells, as well as the mechanical 
properties of tissue.’’

Their original plan was to 

position cells around tiny pillars 
of soft silicone that acted as scar 
tissue, then apply different treat-
ments to the cells and measure 
the deformation of silicone as the 
cells expand and contract.

But to do so, the team first 

needed to figure out how to 
mold the soft silicone, a mate-
rial known as Sylgard 527, into 
the desired shape — which is 
where the cotton candy came in. 
The team’s initial instrument of 
choice, hard epoxy molds, proved 
unviable because silicone pillars 
were so soft they disintegrated 

upon removal from the mold.

However, a chance encounter 

in the kitchen for a member of 
the team, Christopher Moraes, 
assistant professor of chemical 
engineering at McGill University, 
led to a new idea. Moraes worked 
on the team as a postdoctoral 
researcher at the University.

In the process of making an 

unsuccessful batch of cotton 
candy, Moraes noticed that the 
hard slab of candy he was left 
with captured every detail of the 
pan in which it was molded.

This fueled an idea to make a 

mold out of sugar, cast the Syl-
gard 527 in the candy mold and 
finally, immerse the mold water 
so it will dissolve, leaving only 
the silicon pillars.

“I actually wouldn’t describe 

it as a ‘Eureka’ moment, as much 
as a ‘hmm … that’s odd’ moment, 
before I threw away the candy 
disaster in disgust and went to 
bed,” he said. “I woke up the next 
morning with the idea of what 
that might mean in the lab. This 
accidental process happens quite 
frequently, but perhaps 99 per-
cent of the ideas that I have end 
up failing.”

The team had by then spent 

nine months trying to find the 
right materials for their project 
through repeated trial and error 
— leaving them open to the new 
idea.

After testing Moraes’ conjec-

ture with stunt glass, a common 
feature of Hollywood action 
films and an essentially sugar-
based material, the team formu-
lated the recipe for the perfect 
mold: a simple, sweet-smelling 
concoction made largely of sugar 
and corn syrup.

“For me, this project is unusu-

al in that it really emphasizes the 
fun and surprise of doing science 
and engineering research, an 
aspect that is often overlooked 
when scientists reflect on their 
work,” he said. “I mean — who 
would have thought that candy-
makers would have figured out 
the secrets needed to micro-fab-
ricate tissues?”

Nobel prize-winner discusses 
study of molecules, motion

Harvard professor 

talks complex 
simulations in 

chemistry

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Nobel Prize-winner Martin 

Karplus, professor emeritus of 
chemistry at Harvard Universi-
ty, delivered the Oncley Lecture 
in Biophysics at the Rackham 
Amphitheater on Friday. 

Karplus received the Nobel 

Prize in Chemistry in 2013 with 
Stanford Biology Prof. Michael 
Levitt and Arieh Warshel, a 
chemistry professor at the Uni-
versity of Southern California, 
for their work on computational 
simulations.

In a talk titled “Motion: The 

Hallmark of Life. From Mar-
supials to Molecules,” Karplus 
explained how the motion of 
molecules makes the motion of 
entire animals possible.

He began by quoting physicist 

Richard Feynman’s “Lectures 

on Physics,” which emphasized 
the importance of understand-
ing the motion of atoms and 
molecules 
in 
understanding 

the motion of living organisms: 
“Everything that living things 
do can be understood in terms 
of the jiggling and wiggling of 
atoms.”

He pointed out several dif-

ferent applications of under-
standing how molecules move 
— applications made possible in 
part by the computation simu-
lations for which he and his 
colleagues received the Nobel 
Prize.

The simulations, which Kar-

plus, Levitt and Warshel began 
in the 1970s, developed an eas-
ier method to replicate chemi-
cal reactions using computers. 
Prior to their work, chemists 
had to use advanced calcula-
tions based on quantum physics 
to simulate reactions. Because 
the calculations were so com-
plex, the simulations required 
enormous computing power, 
meaning chemists could only 
simulate the reactions of small, 
simple molecules.

To address this issue, Karplus 

said he and his colleagues com-
bined quantum physics with the 
simpler, less computationally 
demanding Newtonian physics 
to simulate chemical reactions 
for more complex molecules.

They discovered that while 

quantum physics is required for 
simulating chemical reactions 
at the specific site on the mole-
cules where the reaction occurs, 
the simpler Newtonian physics 
could be used for simulating the 
impact of the reaction on the 
rest of the molecule. Quantum 
mechanics studies the activity 
going on inside an atom.

The computational simula-

tions discovered by Karplus 
and his colleagues are now fre-
quently used in multiple spheres 
of chemistry research, such 
as simulating how synthetic 
drugs interact with proteins in 
a person’s body and how defec-
tive proteins behave differently 
from normal proteins.

Match/National Marrow Donor 
Program, Gift of Life Michigan 
and Eversight Michigan.

This year, Sunday’s “Be a 

Hero” event collected more 
than 400 units of blood, break-
ing last year’s all-time record of 
340 units. All donated blood will 
be included in the University’s 
Blood Battle total.

Throughout the next three 

weeks, Blood Drives United, the 
student-run organization that 
co-sponsors the Blood Battle 
competition, will host about 46 
blood drives at various locations 
around campus.

Ward and Lydia Kimball, 

residents of West Branch, Mich., 
attended the event to promote 
organ donor registration. Their 

18-year-old son, Evan, died in 
a car accident last month, and 
his organs were donated to five 
different recipients. They have 
since started working to educate 
and raise awareness about organ 
donation with Gift of Life Mich-
igan, an organization that works 
to maximize organ and tissue 
donation by registering donors 
and raising awareness.

“I promised him that his 

name would never ever be for-
gotten, and I think with his gifts 
and the spurring of the donor 
registry, that’s how we do that,” 
Kimball said.

Marge Del Greco, a two-time 

liver donation recipient, also 
works with Gift of Life Michi-
gan and helped people register 
as donors at the event.

“This is my way of giving 

back,” Del Greco said. “I pro-
mote wherever I can, however I 
can, to get the word out, and to 
get people to register.”

She said when she received 

her first liver transplant in 
2004, people did not understand 
the necessity of organ dona-
tion. When she first began to 
volunteer she struggled to reg-
ister donors. However, she said 
events like Blood Battle have 
helped raise awareness and 
encourage people to donate.

“Our numbers have tripled,” 

she said. “We’re up to 52 per-
cent of Michigan are registered 
organ donors, and that’s huge 
from where we started. We were 
below the national average, 
below 30 percent of the state.”

LSA junior Laurel Fricker, a 

member of Blood Drives United, 
emphasized the importance of 
donating blood and said events 
like the Blood Battle make 
donating more fun.

“Each donor can save poten-

tially three lives with their 
donation,” she said.

focus on the players’ skills 
instead,” he said.

Engineering sophomore Roy 

Berg, vice president of the SVA, 
echoed Mendicelli’s sentiments. 

Berg, who is also a Marine Corps 
veteran and played for the Navy 
team, said the event illustrates 
the University’s commitment to 
celebrating diversity.

Overall, Hoff said, the event 

is growing every year and he 
hopes continuing it will inspire 
the University and other schools 

within the Big Ten to start 
their own wheelchair athletic 
leagues.

“We’re bringing together vet-

erans, we’re bringing together 
people with disabilities, we’re 
bringing together our student 
population,” he said.

pictures, candles and marigold 
flowers.

LSA senior Thalia Maya, 

Lambda Theta Alpha sorority 
president, said the ball was an 
opportunity for the sorority to 
educate other students about 
Dia de los Muertos and Latin 
heritage.

“It’s more than just being 

able to eat good food and be 
able to come together as peo-
ple in the Latin community,” 
Maya said. “It’s being able to 
remember those who have 
passed away, the loved ones and 
friends who were really impor-
tant to us.”

Rackham student Orquidea 

Morales, the event’s keynote 
speaker, said Dia de los Muer-
tos is her favorite holiday. Pur-
suing a doctorate in American 
Culture, Morales said she was 
recommended by her professor 
to speak based on her research 
on death at the border between 
Mexico and the United States.

Morales transferred from the 

University of Texas-Pan Ameri-
can, which has a significantly 
higher Latin population than 

the University of Michigan, 
which has an undergraduate 
Latin population of 4.93 percent.

“It does feel weird walking 

around being one of the few 
Latino students, and knowing 
there’s a really high attrition 
rate when it comes to under-
graduate students of color,” she 
said.

Morales said she wanted to 

do something culturally specific 
this year that would bring vis-
ibility to the Latin community.

Posada is an alum of Lambda 
Theta Alpha, which was the first 
Latina sorority in the country. 
She painted her face in solidar-
ity with her University sisters 
and to honor the event.

“I’m really proud of the chap-

ter and the programming that 
they do, because it is very much 
about empowerment,” Posada 
said. 
“Empowerment 
of 
all 

women, but of course empower-
ment of Latino women.”

Roberto Perez, the Office of 

Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 
program manager, said he had 
a positive experience working 
with the sorority and the Michi-
gan Latin@ Assembly to con-
struct the event.

“Reaching out to the (Michi-

gan Latin@ Assembly) orga-

nization, and really getting a 
sense of unity and partnership 
with them has been really well 
received,” Perez said. “Both 
organizations have worked real-
ly well together.”

Perez said LatinX is a term 

used this year to be more inclu-
sive of those whose gender 
expressions are more fluid, act-
ing as an alternative to binary 
words within the Spanish lan-
guage referring to gender iden-
tity.

“(It’s) a term used to be 

more inclusive for those who 
don’t identify within the male/
female binary,” Perez said. “So 
that includes those who might 
identify as queer, transgender 
or cisgender, or anything else 
within the spectrum that isn’t 
very simply identified as male/
female.”

LatinX celebrated the month 

with more than 20 events, 
including a lecture on the cul-
tural and historical tradition 
of the quinceañera, a girl’s 15th 
birthday signifying her transi-
tion into adulthood, and a panel 
discussion where Latina faculty 
members shared their experi-
ences as people of color at the 
University.

Labuz echoed his sentiments, 
and said their project proves 
out-of-the-box thinking can 
often be useful for research.
“A lot of times, both people 
who work on research, and 
also people who don’t, imagine 
that research has to be done 
a certain way, and ideas can 
only come from big complicat-
ed textbooks and long equa-
tions and things like that,” he 
said. “But a lot of times the 
best ideas are the simplest or 
the most obvious ones.”
Takayama said the discovery 
will allow new avenues for 
cell-based research in model-

ing delicate processes.
“It is important technologi-
cally because it enables prac-
tical measurements of forces 
otherwise very difficult to 
perform,” he said.
For this reason, the team has 
decided not to patent the fab-
rication technique, first pub-
lished earlier this year.
“That’s not to say that patents 
or being the first to publish 
or being recognized for being 
the first to discover something 
isn’t important,” Labuz said. 
“But at least the way our lab 
operates is, once we have an 
idea or technique down or val-
idated, we are happy to share 
it with other people.”
Moraes said he hoped that the 
technique can also be lever-

aged beyond the field of sci-
ence, suggesting that it could 
be used to make “smart” or 
“dynamic” candy that was 
customized to specific flavor 
profiles.
Moving forward, he still faced 
a personal challenge: figuring 
out how to make cotton candy 
successfully.
“My last attempt wasn’t nearly 
as horrible as my first, but still 
nowhere near the expert hand-
pulled cotton candy product,” 
he said. “I might switch over 
to trying hand-pulled noodles 
first, which uses a similar 
pulling technique but seems to 
be a little more forgiving than 
candy.”

Supporting a sanctuary campus

JOSE ALVARENGA AND LAMIN MANNEH | VIEWPOINT

I 

was blessed with the chance to live the 
typical overscheduled suburban kid 
lifestyle. I say “blessed” because having 

the means to keep busy by 
over-scheduling my life 
was an absolute privilege.

Every year, I begged my 

mother to sign me up for a 
new after-school activity, 
never quitting the previ-
ous one. By sixth grade, I 
committed each week to 
nine hours of gymnastics 
practices, four hours of 
music lessons, two hours 
of all-city choir and at least 
an hour of drama practice.

I regularly ate dinner in a thermos, as some-

one’s parent in an elaborate three-way carpool 
shuttled me to my next activity. I often fell 
asleep doing homework and woke up early to 
practice violin. I remember collapsing onto a 
mat one night at gymnastics practice and ask-
ing my teammates if it was Friday yet. It was 
Monday. I was 12.

In a recent New York Times piece, Bruce 

Feiler explored where the 
true costs of busy, over-
scheduled 
childhoods 

lie. According to Feiler’s 
research, structure can be 
good for children. It helps 
them perfect new skills 
and keeps them out of 
trouble. The costs occur 
when children feel pres-
sured to succeed at these 
activities. Luckily for me, 
my parents never pres-
sured me to aim higher 
with my activities. If anything, in high school 
they frequently asked me if I would like to quit 
certain obligations so that I could get more than 
four hours of sleep per night.

The pressure I felt came from my peers rath-

er than my parents. Seeing everyone around me 
overbook themselves and do well in everything 
influenced me to keep going, even though I was 
starting to lose enjoyment and burn out doing 
my favorite activities.

As I entered college, I felt pressured to be 

busy doing less of what I loved and more of 
what I thought might look impressive on future 
applications. Initially I signed up for uninter-
esting academic clubs and tedious classes, hop-
ing their prestige might set me apart from the 
crowd. Since I cared so little for these obliga-
tions, I quickly became overwhelmed and had 
no sense of fulfillment to push me through the 
toughest days.

Being busy became more manageable when I 

started pursuing things I actually enjoyed. This 
year I’m the busiest I have ever been in col-
lege, but I’m also the happiest. No matter how 
little sleep I get, each morning I jump out of bed 
because there are so many exciting things to do 

throughout my day. I get to write, sing, teach, 
work, study and interact with amazing people 
along the way. Because I practiced being busy 
as a child, I finally know how to manage my 
time and prioritize my most important respon-
sibilities. Friends tell me that I exude a sense of 
joy and optimism that I never did before.

On the rare occasions when I still feel 

stressed out and overwhelmed, I try my best 
not to complain about how busy I am. For one 
thing, I would choose being busy over idleness 
any day. Last year, I had the rare experience 
of accidentally under-scheduling my life. A 
research opportunity fell through and classes 
turned out to be easier than expected, so I had 
several extra hours of empty time in my week 
that I hadn’t anticipated. Rather than using this 
time to study more or find a new hobby, I spent 
most of it sleeping and watching TV.

While those who oppose a busy lifestyle 

might applaud me for indulging in some valu-
able “me time,” I felt completely empty. Per-
haps my structured childhood influenced me 
to unhealthily crave it, but I truly felt that by 
sitting around doing nothing I was wasting my 
chance to explore all of the opportunities that 

the University offers.

Another reason I avoid 

complaining about being 
busy is because I don’t 
want to promote a sense 
of 
competition 
among 

my peers. As Tim Kre-
ider wrote in a New York 
Times opinion piece, pro-
claiming our busyness is 
often a “boast disguised 
as a complaint” because 
it lets others know that 
we’re going above and 

beyond to achieve our goals. Kreider then goes 
on to speak about larger themes surrounding 
the importance of idleness.

Though some University students are busy 

working full-time jobs out of financial neces-
sity, others choose being busy as a way to set 
themselves apart from the crowd. By discuss-
ing how busy our impressive-sounding respon-
sibilities leave us, we inadvertently make others 
feel inadequate or guilty for choosing a more 
relaxed schedule. 

I’m glad I grew up in a time when being busy 

was encouraged. This culture has allowed me 
to push myself past the limits of what I thought 
was possible to achieve in a single day, and it 
has given me the chance to learn a multitude of 
new skills. Even though our society can some-
times have an unhealthy, competitive obsession 
regarding busyness, I know that as long as my 
desire to fill my time is internally motivated 
I will always have the drive to explore new 
opportunities and carry out each of my respon-
sibilities with diligence and enthusiasm.

Happily over-scheduled

T

he Internet has become 
littered 
with 
marketing 

gimmicks. It’s bad enough 

that 
sidebar 

banners clutter 
the 
periphery 

of websites; just 
when 
you’ve 

trained yourself 
to ignore them, 
native 
adver-

tising 
ensures 

that you’ll find a 
few promotions 
embedded 
in 

your news arti-
cle as well that 
often match the format of other 
articles. But there’s a certain type 
of junk that’s more common than 
the rest — diet and weight-loss ads.

These ads pervade magazine 

shelves 
and 
commercials, 
too, 

and there’s no surprise why: it’s 
an extremely rewarding market. 
About one in seven Americans have 
used a non-prescription weight-
loss supplement at some point in 
their lives. This statistic is less sur-
prising when you consider that 38 
percent of individuals who make 
New Years resolutions make losing 
weight their first priority.

Besides that, anyone who has had 

as much as a passing thought about 
fitness has probably wondered 
what simple trick could be “mak-
ing nutritionists furious.” And for 
people who are serious about get-
ting fit (through whatever means), 
this passing curiosity can quickly 
become an intense obsession.

My fixation on being fit came to 

me during my senior year of high 
school. Having been out of shape 
for a majority of my life, I decided 
to finally make whatever changes 
were necessary. With college just 
around the corner, I was deter-
mined to reach my goals as quickly 
and efficiently as possible.

I can’t count how many nights 

I spent browsing not-so-reputable 
sources online trying to turn my 
fitness dreams into reality. Worse 
yet, I would usually pick up a diet 
or exercise routine for a few weeks, 
only to replace it with another one 
I thought to be more convincing. I 
spent Halloween on the Atkins diet; 
by Thanksgiving, I was no-carb. 
I alternated between lifting and 
jogging as my ideas about which 
one would allow me to get fit more 
quickly shifted.

All this was motivated by my 

self-imposed time constraint. I 
wanted to look as good as possible 
going into college. And eventually, 
stumbling through a host of diet 
and exercise regimens actually paid 
off. But at what cost?

I had paid 

hundreds 
of 

dollars 
for 

supplements 
I 
thought 

would 
hasten 

my 
progress. 

Countless 
hours 
were 

wasted 
“researching” 
(read: 
obsess-

ing) over what 
routine 
was 

best. Worst of all, I didn’t really 
learn anything. Which type of diet 
was most effective? What exercise 
is most important for losing weight? 
The answers to these questions 
were lost in my mess of a year.

Looking back, it seems the effi-

cacy of those fads stemmed from 
the fact that they’re advertised to 
be uniquely fast. Rarely do you see a 
diet ad that doesn’t promise results 
in a matter of weeks. As consumers, 
we’re naturally inclined to desire 
the product immediately. So how 
can we make ourselves immune to 
this damning temptation?

I think we need to change how 

we view diets and nutrition at a 
fundamental level. There’s a mis-
leading conception that the answer 
to “how do I lose weight” is some-
thing to be discovered, on the 
Internet or otherwise. But the third 
word of that question is I, and your 
experiences might differ dramati-
cally from someone else’s.

In truth, the “secret to losing 

weight” is a knowledge that comes 
from self-experimentation. We are 
nothing more than complicated, 
walking 
biochemical 
processes. 

Try changing one variable at a time 
and see how your body responds. 
Does eating carbs before hitting the 
gym help you lift more? Try it for a 
few weeks and find out. Would 30 
minutes of walking be sufficient to 

burn off that 
dessert you ate? 
Do it and see 
whether 
the 

effect on your 
weight appears 
or not, keeping 
everything else 
constant. When 
it comes to our 
own 
bodies, 

these personal 
experiments 
(when 
done 

correctly) can be more valuable 
than even scientific literature on 
 

the subject.

If I had been so structured with 

my progress, I may have delayed my 
goals by about a year. But the knowl-
edge I’d gain would have been well 
worth the wait. Next time you come 
across a fitness ad, see if its appeal 
comes from your own eagerness or 
impatience. Then exit out and know 
that the alternate course will be far 
more rewarding.

China’s one-child policy

TO THE DAILY: 

China just announced that it’s ending its one-

child policy. This is a monumental moment for 
me and many others who were directly affected 
by the one-child policy. When I was 6 months 
old, I was adopted from China and brought to 
the United States. For many years, I resented 
this policy. I blamed it for the lack of knowledge 
of my origins and the people I had come from.

But today, I see the policy was a blessing in 

disguise. For without it, I would not be able 
to call the wonderful woman and man who 
raised me Mom and Dad. I would not have my 
beautiful little sister, who also was adopted 
from China. The one-child policy gave me a 
wonderful life, full of loving people and great 
opportunities. But with its end, I am look-
ing forward to seeing China’s families grow 
 

and prosper.

For the University to be the 

diverse, 
inclusive, 
representa-

tive and great campus it claims to 
be, it must stand with immigrant 
communities by opening access to 
education for immigrant students, 
defending sanctuary cities and 
declaring itself a sanctuary cam-
pus. The state of Michigan is a his-
toric place of refuge for immigrants 
from all over the world, including 
the world’s second-largest Arab 
and Muslim population outside of 
the Middle East (after Paris) and a 
growing Latino community. Refu-
gee children from Central America 
and more recently from war-torn 
countries like Syria are already 
residing in cities like Detroit, Grand 
Rapids and Dearborn with more on 
their way.

Immigration is the question of 

the day everywhere in the world. 
The globalized economy, free trade 
measures, global warming and the 
foreign policies of stronger pow-
ers exploiting poorer nations: these 
factors have combined to create one 
of the most massive relocations of 
humanity across national borders 
in all of world history. The United 
Nations reported in June that cur-
rently, one in every 122 people are 
refugees displaced by war, violence 
and persecution, the highest num-
ber of refugees since World War II.

In 2015, 700,000 immigrants 

are estimated to have arrived in 
Europe by sea, and 3,138 refugees 
are reported to have died this year 
in the Mediterranean. Last year, at 
least 68,541 unaccompanied children 
crossed the southern border into the 
United States from various Central 
American countries — El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras — seeking 
to escape the gang violence, death 
squads and poverty. This worldwide 
mass migration is ongoing, and is 
profoundly 
transforming 
many 

nations.

Yet as we become a majority-

minority nation, there hasn’t been 
a corresponding increase in the 
rights of racial and ethnic minori-

ties. However, there has been a 
corresponding struggle and polar-
ization 
over 
immigrant 
rights. 

Under some of the most vicious 
attacks against immigrants in the 
United States, including a record 
high of more than two million 
deportations, the immigrant rights 
movement — led by undocumented 
youth with actions in the streets, 
college campuses, detention centers 
and Congress chambers — has won 
important victories. These include 
in-state tuition in more than 16 
states, state-sponsored financial 
aid like the California Dream Act, 
work permits for some undocu-
mented youth with Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrivals and a work 
permit for immigrant parents with 
Deferred Action for Parents of 
Americans and Lawful Permanent 
Residents, which has been stalled 
by a right-wing legal challenge. 
The immigrant rights movement 
increases in strength with each vic-
tory, over and against each attack.

The student movement at the 

University has won recently impor-
tant victories for immigrant stu-
dents — in-state tuition and a small 
scholarship pilot program that 
allotted $450,000 for undocument-
ed undergraduate students for the 
2014-2015 year. But the conditions 
for undocumented immigrant and 
international students are still far 
from equal. The University must 
increase the number of undocu-
mented students.

The University of California, 

Berkeley has taken important steps 
to open access and support for 
undocumented students by creating 
an undocumented student center to 
provide financial aid, free legal aid 
and cover the legal filing fees to apply 
for DACA. Since the creation of the 
program, the numbers of undocu-
mented students at UC Berkeley has 
doubled. The University should fol-
low Berkeley’s example. The schol-
arship for undocumented students 
must be increased, expanded to 
include graduate students, and publi-

cized to prospective students. Over-
all, the University must guarantee 
the continuation of the program.

Both educational access and the 

safety of immigrant students must 
be a priority for the University. This 
means the University must publicly 
declare itself a sanctuary campus for 
immigrants. Currently, Ann Arbor 
and Detroit are sanctuary cities, 
meaning that local authorities aren’t 
supposed to turn over undocument-
ed immigrants to U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement.

A recent proposal in the Michi-

gan Legislature is threatening these 
sanctuary cities, forcing city offi-
cials to publicly defend the impor-
tance of these sanctuaries against 
a dangerous precedent of open 
anti-immigrant bigotry from gov-
ernment officials, institutions and 
racists, most clearly expressed in 
the xenophobic rhetoric of Repub-
lican presidential candidate Donald 
Trump’s campaign. The scapegoat-
ing of immigrants in Europe and 
the United States for the economic 
and environmental crisis on the 
part of politicians and national 
leaders is already creating a dan-
gerous situation similar to that of 
the 1930s, which led to World War 
II and the Holocaust.

These recent attacks necessitate 

the leadership of public figures and 
institutions like the University to 
defend the rights of immigrants in 
this country and prevent the anti-
immigrant bigotry on campus from 
becoming a real physical threat to 
immigrant students and commu-
nity members.

Central 
Student 
Government 

will be considering a resolution to 
support making the University a 
sanctuary campus this Tuesday. 
We encourage immigrant rights 
supporters to join us in support of 
the resolution.

FILM REVIEW
Undercooked ‘Burnt’

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

I’m going to get these out 

of the way fast. “Burnt” is 
a carefully constructed but 
undercooked 
drama 
of 
a 

film, 
crafted 

out of heavily 
seasoned 
empty 
calories 
that 
leave 

the 
viewer 

partially 
satisfied, but 
hungry 
for 

something more substantial. 
The 
characters, 
especially 

Bradley Cooper’s genius but 
erratic 
hothead, 
are 
over-

talked and half-baked, paired 
with mouthwatering food porn 
montages that whip around 
in an effort to impress but 
ultimately prove more flash 
than flavor. Alright, fun over.

More seriously, “Burnt” is 

a film with a lot of potential. 
Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper, 
“Silver 
Linings 
Playbook”) 

is a fallen mastermind of a 
chef, whose tumultuous life 
of drugs, alcohol and women 
in Paris has dragged him to 
ruin. After getting clean, he 
moves 
to 
London 
looking 

for culinary redemption in 
the form of a coveted three 
star Michelin rating. But, to 
reestablish 
himself 
in 
the 

high-stakes, high-class world 
of culinary virtuosity, he must 
reconnect with lost friends and 
competitors to put together an 
expert kitchen staff and regain 
the respect of his community

An engrossing story and well-

balanced cast, however, are not 
all that make a movie, something 
that director John Wells (“The 
Company Men”) seems both 
overly aware of and not sure of 
at all. Cooper’s manic, Gordon 
Ramsey-esque Adam Jones is a 
rock star whose passion borders 
on caricature. His screaming, 
crying, throwing and walking 
really, really dramatically in a 
leather jacket and shades adds 
up to almost nothing in the end: 
a predictably intense character 
with a tortured mind we can 
just barely begin to understand. 

Cooper’s significant moments, 
cooking 
for 
another 
chef’s 

daughter or staying up late to 
look for the perfect cut of fish, 
are snuck in between these 
melodramatic episodes, almost 
mistakenly carrying the film 
in their subtlety. In this same 
vein, the script twirls small 
moments of authenticity out 
of the kitchen staff’s behind-
the-scenes camaraderie or talk 
of the now-established chefs’ 
rough 
beginnings 
in 
more 

famous restaurants. However, 
it is rare that these moments 
are not followed by an explicit 
and 
overwrought 
branch 
of 

explanatory dialogue, stopping 
much of this emotional success in 
its tracks. The film seems unsure 
of the strength of these restrained 
but successful overlaps of writing 
and cast, filling possible breathing 
room with needless intensity.

In this intensity, though, 

“Burnt” is not a standalone story. 
From “Hell’s Kitchen” to “Chef,” 
cooking TV shows and movies 
are turning away from the idea of 
the kitchen as a warm, feminine 
space to characterizing chefs as 

masculine artists who will do 
anything to get to the top. Chefs 
are no longer the Julia Child-
like providers but unpredictable, 
tortured rock stars. The blue 
flame of a burner, the clean 
swipe of a knife through meat, 
a kaleidoscopic array of freshly 
chopped fruit and the final 
precise dip of spoon to plate are 
all captured in “Burnt” with 
an artistic reverence, flicked 
through 
with 
the 
rhythmic 

intensity of any music video. 
Although 
Sienna 
Miller’s 

(“American Sniper”) Helene, a 
chef working under Adam Jones, 
steps up with a formidable 
toughness apart from the typical 
idea of cooking as a feminine 
means of provision. But she is 
shown multiple times making 
breakfast for her daughter in the 
mornings and acts almost as a 
bridge between these opposite 
interpretations 
of 
kitchen 

space. This doesn’t mean she’s 
his equal, though, and like the 
scores of women before her, falls 
under the spell of Adam Jones’s 
womanizing sway.

Playing into the culinary rock 

star genre, “Burnt” does little to 
expand on the masculinization 
of the kitchen other than add 
another screaming, heated voice 
to the chorus. Although the cast 
and general plot have potential, 
the film flounders in its moments 
of self-doubt, overshadowing its 
most powerful moments with 
heavy-handed intensity.

STYLE REVIEW
Halloween fashion

By Daily Style Writers

Halloween 2015 went out 

with a bang. Here are some of 
The Michigan Daily style team 
shares the most notable looks 
from at hoMe and Hollywood.

Celebrity Costumes
Kim Kardashian West
Another 
year, 
another 

Halloween, 
another 
Kim 

Kardashian 
Halloween 

costume. In the past Kim 
has taken full advantage of 
the holiday to dress up as the 
likes of superheroes, Disney 
princesses and various types 
of feline creatures. However, 
this year, she did something 
totally unexpected, something 
no one could have predicted. 
Ladies and gentleman, Kim 
Kardashian dressed up as Kim 
Kardashian for Halloween 2015. 
Channeling her hideous-couch 
floral printed gown from the 
2013 Met Ball, Kardashian paid 
homage to her former pregnant 
self. Lazy or genius? Call it 
whatever you want, but we 
can’t help but wonder if Yeezus 
himself inspired this act of pure 
narcissism. Bottom line is, the 
outfit didn’t work in 2013, and 
it still isn’t working now, Kim, 
this is a worst dressed for sure. 

— Mariam Sheikh

Gigi Hadid
Gigi Hadid slayed Halloween 

as “Grease” ’s Sandra Dee. Not 
only does she already look like 
Sandra with her blond hair, 
Hadid wore a half mesh off-the-
shoulder black crop top, black 
Lycra 
high-waisted 
leggings 

and a leather jacket with lacing 
details. 
She 
completes 
her 

Sandra Dee look with tight 
blond curls, bright red heels, 
nails and lipstick — and of 
course a fake cigarette. Best 
dressed. — Carly Colonnese

Heidi Klum
Klum is known for going 

all-out every Halloween in the 
costume department for her 
annual 
spook-tacular 
bash. 

While 
for 
most 
Halloween 

costumes are simply accessories 
or clothing, for Klum, nothing is 
off limits. From prosthetics and 
latex to a whole lot of fur, her 
mission is to truly transform 
each year. Needless to say, 
she has set high expectations 
for her fans, and this year she 
disappointed. 
Klum 
dressed 

as an even tackier version of 
Jessica Rabbit — the outfit 
was all glitz and no glam, all 
fire without the flare. She gets 
my vote for most effort given 

without the reward. Maybe 
next year, Heidi. — Mariam 
Sheikh

Campus Costumes
Cutie Scooby
Always on the lookout for 

a great Scooby Doo rendition, 
this particular canine costume 
caught my eye. Dressed in a 
midi brown bodycon dress and 
headband fitted with a goofy 
Scooby face, this Halloweener 
gets major props for being 
straightforward 
and 
stylish. 

Her high neck paired perfectly 
with the handmade felt collar 
(creativity, 
people!), 
which 

could have easily been mistaken 
for a chic choker. Someone 
deserves a Scooby Snack. —
Mara Maclean

Loofah
Nothing like a costume that’s 

hilarious without sacrificing 
cuteness. Thursday night I ran 
into a pair of loofahs, pulled 
together with shower caps, rope 
handles and lots of colorful 
tulle. Sure the costumes are a 
little on the voluminous side 
(loofahs are round, after all), 
but once you get past hip-length 
it’s all about the legs. Color 
coordinating in baby blue and 
hot pink, this was a pair to 
remember. — Kathleen Davis

I saw Hilary Duff live

HOLLYWOOD RECORDS

“This spoon tastes so good! I love the taste of spoon!”

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

This week, Daily Music Writers 

are looking back on the first albums 
they ever loved. Today, Catherine 
Baker remembers Hilary Duff’s 
Metamorphosis.

My name is Catherine Baker. It 

is 2004. I am eight years old. This 
is a story about Hilary Duff.

Looking back at my childhood 

(or at least the parts of it I haven’t 
blocked out of my memory), the 
moments I’m most nostalgic for 
are those spent in front of my 
small karaoke machine in the 
playroom of one of my old houses. 
I am usually alone, which is an 
unfortunate side effect of moving 
four times in four years, and I 
am often wearing a pink feather 
boa that once belonged to my 
cousin. (This is an unfortunate 
side effect of not having a strong 
fashion icon in my life. Mom, I’m 
looking at you.)

I would like to preface this by 

emphasizing the fact that I was 
an extremely angsty pre-teen. 
For a child with a low tolerance 
for conflict and eye contact, I 
sure had a lot of pent up anxiety. 
Clearly, this manifested itself in 
my affinity for Disney Channel 
stars and movies about dogs.

In this room with floor to 

ceiling windows, I arrange my 
Webkinz in a semi-circle at my 
feet, boot up my old karaoke 
machine and belt out “Sweet 
Sixteen” by Hilary Duff. In that 
moment, I’m not awkward, eight-
year-old 
Catherine 
with 
too 

many thoughts and not enough 
athletic ability. Right then, I am a 
much older, much more confident 
version of myself, dreaming about 
“driving down to the club where 
we go to dance.”

Fast-forward to 2006, three 

weeks before my 10th birthday. 
I’ve moved again, this time to 
Michigan, and my mother has 
driven me back to Ohio for one 
last hurrah before I begin the 
adventure that is fourth grade. 
Five of my closest friends have 
gathered to see — you guessed it 
— Hilary Duff in concert.

As this is my first concert 

experience, I am dressed in my 
best jean skirt and sweater combo 
with no idea what to expect. Her 
sister Haylie is the opening act, 
and while I know relatively little 
about the rest of the Duff family, it 
does not stop me from screaming 
at the top of my tiny little lungs. 
After a few sugary sweet pop 
songs, Haylie exits, and the 
entire stadium erupts with cheers 
calling for Hilary. When she 
finally enters in the wake of neon 
strobe lights, I am silent in awe 
of her sparkly outfit and opening 
dance number.

My pink feather boa has been 

lost in the move, but for a moment 
I wish it was wrapped around 
my neck one last time. I know 
every word to the Metamorphosis 
album, and I fall asleep before 
the end of the concert, but it is 
the happiest moment of my short 
life thus far. I look around at the 
thousands of strangers singing 
the exact same words, at the 
parents that have been dragged 
along to this 17-year-old’s show 
and at my friends whose names 
I’ve now forgotten. Even at nine 
years old, I’ve been around long 
enough to know that I won’t see 
these girls again. This is their 
lasting memory of me—Catherine, 
in her fuzzy purple sweater that 
sheds on your clothes when you 
hug her, screaming the words to 
“Come Clean” with just a little too 
much aggression.

While Metamorphosis may not 

be the coolest first favorite album, 
it certainly made an impact on an 
impressionable young Catherine. 
From singing alone in my room to 
dancing with thousands, Hilary 
helped me grow up even when I 
didn’t know how.

This is a story 
about Hilary 

Duff.

ALBUM REVIEW
EL VY is really fake

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

Indie music is dead, or at 

least, whatever we once vaguely 
referred to as “indie music” 
doesn’t 
really 
exist 

anymore. 
Modern 
musicians 
that 
could 

once 
be 

associated 
with 
this 

now-obsolete 
breed 
have 

to 
turn 
into 
themselves, 

hiding away from the fake 
genuineness of the industry 
that the Millennials seem to 
enjoy so much and thriving on 
the genuine fakeness that they 
have to adopt. The genuine 
fakeness 
sells 
the 
records, 

builds the image of the (again, 
obsolete) indie rock king or 
queen and revitalizes that last 
tiny shred of what was was once 
interesting in the “indie” sense.

The 
National 
is 
one 
of 

those 
last 
bands 
of 
this 

dying 
music 
genus. 
Their 

highly 
layered, 
intensely 

thoughtful 
instrumentation 

and production matches with 
Berninger’s 
solemn 
musings 

about some sad story of the past. 
Or he’s drowning the listener in 
nostalgia. Or he’s mumbling in 
his monotone speech about his 
spiked lemonade. Eccentricity 
is relatable, and it’s interesting. 
In that small differentiator, 
The 
National 
collected 
its 

vehement 
fan 
base. 
Annie 

Clark (also known by her stage 
name, St. Vincent) has likewise 
weaved herself strangely into 
this 
disintegrating 
musical 

fabric. Clark holds similar 
lyrical and musical themes: 
extreme musical talent and 
disparaging experiences beat 
against 
an 
obsession 
with 

the sonically unexpected and 
abstract.

The collaboration of Brett 

Knopf, formerly of Menomena 
and current surveyor of Ramona 
Falls, 
and 
Matt 
Berninger 

of The National and their 
longtime artistic project, EL 
VY, successfully followed suit 
in this strange categorization. 
They’re fighting off the chains 
that bind and engaging in a 
display of fake genuinity to sell 
their art. They’re harnessing 
their mutually mild amounts 
of fame to broker just a bit 
of 
artistic 
expression 
and 

understanding in the duo’s 
brainchild, Return to the Moon. 
In what Berninger confidently 
calls a “rock opera,” the album 
holds only a few constants: a girl 
named DiDi, nostalgia, enigma, 
doubt and an oddly relatable 
struggle with masculinity.

These 
two 
old 
friends, 

Berninger 
and 
Knopf, 

clearly 
demonstrate 
how 

unintimidated they are by the 
constructs that are supposed 
to bind them: Knopf, a lesser 
known 
artist, 
holds 
fewer 

expectations than Berninger, 
a man aptly associated with 
solemnity 
and 
strangeness. 

A master of vocal monotony 
and skillful wordsmith, the 
man is an enigma who adds 
his aura of sadness to the 
usually 
crescendoing 
hymns 

of The National. Knopf saves 
Berninger from returning to this 
prescribed identity by replacing 
the detailed musicality of The 
National with simpler sounds of 
a greater variety. Ranging from 
weird upbeat pop songs to bass-
laden rock ‘n’ roll tracks, Knopf 
created a landscape on which 
the strange imagination of Mr. 
Berninger paints.

The album opens with the 

notably joyful track, “Return 
to the Moon (Political Song 
for Didi Bloome to Sing, with 
Crescendo).” 
With 
quirky 

beats and random ascensions 
in musical tone and spirit, 
Berninger uses the song as an 
opportunity to make fun of 
himself. Lacing some of his 
most intensely strange lyrics, 
“bought a saltwater fish from 
a color-blind witch ’cause she 
said she loved it,” Berninger 
gives the judging listener an 
opposite version what they 
would classically expect from 
him: crescendos and enigmas.

Juxtaposing 
the 
pretty 

beginning banger is the sexiest 
track on the album, “I’m the 
Man to Be.” A grungy, pinched 
electric guitar sounds fill in the 
sonic background as Berninger’s 
monologue reveals the struggles 
of masculinity for a rockstar of 
his popularity. He’s confused, 
because on stage — where his 
“dick’s in sunlight, held up by 
kites” — but back in the hotel 
room he’s “crying to room 
service, drinkin’ Malin and 
Goetz under the bed.” It’s all 
very depressing, of course, and 
yet haunting. There we are, 
standing with Berninger in a 
hotel lobby, donning a “come-
and-fuck-me shirt, the green 
one.” Building themes of the 
very strange and specific, the 
rock opera continues.

Nostalgia 
descends 
with 

“Paul 
is 
Alive,” 
the 
third 

single released by EL VY. Soft 
and 
slower 
crescendos 
and 

tangy guitar solos bounce off 
Berninger’s love song for the 
Cincinnati 
rock 
scene 
that, 

from this retrospective point 
of view, reveals the paradoxical 
relationship that can one can 
develop with their childhood: 
how lovely it was, but if given the 
chance we might go back and do 
it all again. Hymnals of wasted, 
faltering love follow, with the 
sarcastic “Need a Friend” and 
spooky 
“Silent 
Ivy 
Hotel.” 

Completed by visceral guitar 
sounds and painstaking one-
liners, these sibling songs round 
off the rock-inspired portion of 
the opera before an air of quiet 
sadness descends.

The rest of the opera reveals 

itself as cartoonishly solemn. 
The descension into anxieties 
and sadness begins with the 
sonically hopeful, piano heavy 
“No Time to Crank the Sun.” 
This track, and the next two 
to follow, ropes the listener 
into the sadder, simpler and 
slightly boring portion of the 
opera. While random musical 
experimentations and oddities 
keep the album’s second half 
interesting, 
it 
all 
flounders 

in comparison to the opera’s 
first movement. “It’s a Game” 
and “Careless,” both lyrically 
dedicated to the story of Didi 
Bloome, aren’t as immersive or 
engaging as the album’s first 
half. Only small bits and pieces 
— an echoing choir or another 
enigmatic 
Berninger 
insight 

(“I don’t want to drag you into 
everything I ain’t no Leonard 
Cohen”) — make the listener 
stick around. The depressive 
listeners will always stay, for 
Berninger’s highly intelligent 
and self-deprecating musings 
are their religious text. An 
unattached listener, or the non-
depressive type, has little left 
for them in the second half of EL 
VY’s opera.

By 
practicing 
in 
fake 

genuineness, 
artists 
are 

recognizing 
that 
the 
media 

and music industry engineers a 
personality, lifestyle and sound 
that a popular but unplaceable 
artist should assume. Artists 
involved in fake genuineness will 
find refuge for their art within 
these 
constructs, 
as 
Annie 

Clark and The National have. 
They bind together, foster one 
another’s originality and unique 
tastes. They’ll write about what 
they actually know rather than 
what they are supposed to know. 
The EL VY project is about this 
kind of art: a collection of odd 
expressions and interpretations 
that rest in genuine feeling or 
experience. Originality saves 
the music industry, and EL VY, 
from where it falters.

KOZM in Kerrytown

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

By DANIEL SAFFRON

Daily Arts Writer

Here at the University, it is 

far too easy to feel swallowed. 
Quite salient is the idea that 
we are at school, at this school, 
on this maize and blue campus, 
still trapped under the same 
fluorescent floods in the same 
claustrophobic Hatcher cubicle 
that looks out upon expanses 
still coddled in the arms of the 
University. 
Sometimes 
when 

trapped in an isolated study box 
the last human contact you’ve 
had is the little prurient note 
on the outlet, or maybe it’s that 
warming feeling you get when 
your fingers match the claw 
marks on the wall and you begin 
to wonder if some other poor 
soulmate out there matches 
your girthsome fingers or if it’s 
just the same claw marks you 
left last week before your EECS 
midterm. 
Sometimes 
when 

this happens you decide on a 
last ditch effort for humanity 
or human connection, so you 
don your warmest wear, wield 
an umbrella and walk toward 
Kerrytown in a night with a 
comfortable chill.

There is an ominous intimacy 

about 
Kerrytown 
Concert 

House. Being such a small venue, 

the art-clad walls support the 
venue’s ambiance very well. Last 
Wednesday, the stage played 
host to KOZM – a duo consisting 
of Javier Orman (violin) and 
Tom Farrell (guitar). Their 
smiles 
wide, 
their 
energy 

infectious, it was obvious that, 
even if no one else was going 
to have fun that night, Orman 
and Farrell were going to. After 
a brief introduction a Latin-
flamenco-folk-fiddle cacophony 
washed over the unsuspecting 
audience. KOZM took over and 
immediately took control.

The sound the duo manages 

to create is impressive. Each 
instrument plays an integral 
role in creating a bed of sound, 
and some extended technique 
is used to create an occasional 
percussive 
presence. 
Both 

of these men can play their 
instruments like the best of 
them. 
Orman’s 
lickety-split 

fingers bolted across the neck, 
and Farrell’s guitar playing can 
only be described as athletic 
— their performance was a 
virtuosic display of stamina.

Despite 
the 
high-energy 

playing 
and 
fluttering 

dissonance, the group’s songs 
are elegant, delicate, cross-
genre amalgamations. At times 
the violin’s lines were Latin 

inspired, at others they were 
folk-derived 
and, 
in 
some 

songs, they sounded like a hair 
metal guitar solo. Nevertheless, 
KOZM wonderfully managed 
to put all these jagged puzzle 
pieces in the correct spot to 
create something unique and 
interesting.

The music was excellent, but 

the charisma of the performers 
set the night over the top. The 
two were unafraid to engage 
the audience, talking to them, 
asking questions and sharing 
anecdotes 
between 
songs. 

After 
the 
show 
was 
over, 

KOZM left the stage directly 
into the audience, introducing 
themselves personally to each 
member. Orman explained that 
the show was the group’s first 
in Ann Arbor and that it was his 
first time back in this city since 
receiving his Master’s here in 
2009.

In early October, the group 

released the live album Panic 
That Way and back in 2013 
released hello Kaleidoscope, a 
full length album. Halloweek 
is over — we’re all tired of 
hearing overplayed pop songs 
and “Hotline Bling” for the 12th 
time. Add something spicy to 
your mix, and go give KOZM a 
listen.

EL VY 

resurrects the 
dying indie rock 

genre.

MUSIC COLUMN

The future is up to 

Chance

C

hance the Rapper’s new 
single is the first song that 
has ever made me yearn 

to be from another part of the 
country. Chance debuted the song 
“Angels” on Stephen Colbert’s 
show last 
week, and his 
performance 
is the most 
Chicago thing 
I’ve ever seen. 
Chance and 
Saba (who 
does the 
hook) are 
both wearing 
Chicago 
radio station hoodies, dancing 
to footwork beats with gospel 
synths and horns courtesy of 
Donnie Trumpet and the Social 
Experiment. In the lyrics, 
Chance contemplates touring 
with Chief Keef, champions his 
independence from major labels 
and honors his Windy City loved 
ones who have passed away (the 
“angels” that he’s got all around 
him). It’s the quintessential lead 
single — it’s exciting because it’s 
undeniably the familiar Chance 
we all love, but it’s also catching 
us up on everything that’s new in 
his life (namely, fatherhood).

As universal as so many of 

Chance’s sentiments are, I’m 
still a little jealous that he’s not 
from my hometown. Not only 
is he pushing himself so hard 
to be better and better with 
every single new project, but 
he’s doing it while staying truer 
to himself and his city than 
anyone else, helping contribute 
to the intensely communal, 
unconditionally loyal scene that 
is current Chicago hip hop and 
R&B.

The combined creative force 

of SAVEMONEY, the entire 
Social Experiment collective 
and everyone one else working 
together to create beautiful 
music in Chicago has to be the 
greatest regional music trend of 
its generation. Though it’s far 
from the beginning of Chicago 
hip hop, the release of Kanye 
West’s The College Dropout 
might be the starting point for 
this community, with Kanye’s 

brilliant refusal to compromise 
himself or twist himself into old 
rap tropes likely hitting so many 
of these artists right when they 
were becoming really passionate 
about music. Since these artists 
were in high school, they’ve 
been creating nationally relevant 
music. Kids These Days was 
an early band that featured Vic 
Mensa and Donnie Trumpet, 
among others, making genre-
bending jazzy rock hip hop when 
they were teenagers. Chief Keef’s 
“I Don’t Like” went viral when 
Keef was just 17, and Chance’s 
origin story finds him making 
his 10 Day mixtape when he was 
suspended from school.

Any passionate young artist 

has ambition and the intense 
desire to do something uniquely 
amazing, but somehow, these 
young Chicago artists have 
actually been able to do that, 
finding success in all different 
styles and paths. Vic Mensa is 
getting ready for his major-label 
debut, making Kanye-approved, 
rough, dark, experimental hip 
hop. Jeremiah, too, has spent the 
past few years reinventing his 
R&B singing to be more Miguel 
and less Chris Brown, and now 
he’s riding the huge hit “Planes” 
and should be coming out with 
Late Nights any day now. (He 
also just released another great 
single, “Oui,” this past week.) 
And there’s also artists like 
Towkio and Noname Gypsy, who 
made not have a signature hit yet 
but are always compelling when 
they’re collaborating with bigger 
names and find the spotlight 
shining on them.

But it’s Chance who’s already 

king of Chicago, playing to 
overflowing festival crowds to 
fans who scream every lyric back 
to him. I’ve been lucky enough 
to see him live four times, and 
especially recently, now that he’s 
gotten the hang of performing, 
he’s one of the best at connecting 
with the crowd, at talking to 
them and letting people know 
how much he cares and how 
much it means to him that his 
fans are so wild for him. (It helps, 
too, to have a live band as hot as 
The Social Experiment, making 

your live tracks dynamic and 
incredibly fun.)

But any great artist can have a 

lot of fans. What makes Chance 
special is his approach to the 
business side of music. I’ve never 
paid for a Chance the Rapper 
song, and I’ve never stolen one 
either — he gives away all of his 
stuff for free. If you’ve taken even 
just one Econ class, you probably 
think that’s a terrible idea, but 
walk through Chicago and you’ll 
see at least a few kids in Social 
Experiment merch, or better yet, 
go to his concerts and see how a 
guy who has never been on the 
radio, who hasn’t even released a 
proper album, can play multiple 
shows a year in Michigan and 
attract thousands of fans every 
time. Chance and co. has given 
themselves to everyone, trusting 
the public and being rewarded 
when everyone gives back. 
“Staying grounded” might be 
a bit of an overrated trait for 
an artist to have (greats like 
Kanye have been able to become 
legends precisely because of their 
otherworldly confidence), but 
even if Chance buys into his hype, 
it’s impossible to imagine him 
ever abandoning Chicago.

I really, really hate to put 

this very weighty label on any 
artist, with all its seriousness 
and high, sometimes narrow-
minded expectations, but if I 
was to call anyone “the voice 
of this generation,” it would be 
Chance the Rapper. I was so 
starved for new Chance that 
these past few days I’ve been 
listening to “Angels” practically 
non-stop, sometimes on repeat 
for literally a dozen times in a 
row. It’s beautiful in its love and 
care for his city and his friends 
and family and powerful in its 
fiery production, and it’s not an 
anomaly. Chance is the dude 
who on Acid Rap put “Paranoia,” 
a dark, meditative track on 
violence in Chicago, right 
between huge bangers “Pusha 
Man” and “Cocoa Butter Kisses.” 
He’s the guy who can sing about 
love, who can look people right 
in the eye at shows and say “I 
love you” or make a whole song 
about going to church with his 
grandma and have it sound 
pure and gorgeous and not 
cheesy. He combines a brilliant 
sense for what people want to 
hear musically with lyrics that 
feature his own natural thoughts 
and emotions, giving us all that 
rare kind of dance music that’s 
also filled with raw hope, love, 
sadness and family.

Chance isn’t a superstar 

groomed from childhood to 
sing pop songs to arenas — he’s 
a guy whose massive success 
grew organically out of his own 
community. He’s universally 
welcoming to everyone, but 
everyone from outside Chicago 
knows exactly what his first and 
most important love and loyalty 
is. It’s easy to doubt someone who 
just wants to keep making music 
with his friends while the major 
players in music want him to 
move away and join them, but if 
Chance and the rest of Chicago’s 
young artists have proven 
anything, it’s that maybe it’s the 
powerful musicians that should 
be trying to move to Chicago.

Theisen wishes he was from 

Chicago. To commiserate on

A moment of waiting and

an answered prayer

M

INNEAPOLIS — Taco 
Charlton held his 
hands in front of his 

chest, his 
palms clasped 
together. 
He looked 
toward the 
sky.

The public-

address 
announcer 
had just said 
the ruling on 
the field was 
that Mitch 
Leidner was down before he 
reached the end zone. No time 
remained on the game clock, 
giving Michigan a 29-26 win.

Next to Charlton, Mo Hurst 

pointed to the ground where 
Leidner fell. He didn’t know 
what happened on the game’s 
final play, but he was hoping with 
all of his heart that Leidner was 
down. Willie Henry pounded his 
chest repeatedly.

They waited, and there was 

nothing else they could do. 
They had half an inch to work 
with, half an inch to avoid 
a devastating defeat for the 
second game in a row. They had 
swarmed Leidner, bringing the 
quarterback to the ground in a 
heap, a group tackle so strong 
it was nearly impossible to 
pick out who exactly was most 
responsible.

Defensive coordinator D.J. 

Durkin knew it was coming, 
Harbaugh said after the game. 
He called his shot, and the 
defense was ready.

But after the tackle, there 

still was that chance, a very real 
chance, that the play could be 
overturned. Michigan did not 
have to look back further than 
its loss to Michigan State to 
realize that crazier things have 
happened.

The air was still, and the 

sanity of an entire team — an 
entire fanbase, really — hinged 
on one voice, that of the PA 

announcer, confirming that 
Leidner was down. All Charlton 
could do was pray.

Pray that for the second game 

in a row, the hopes and dreams 
of the Michigan football team 
would not crumble on a last-
second play. Pray that Wilton 
Speight, the spunky redshirt 
freshman quarterback, had not 
led a comeback in vain.

Before Saturday, Speight had 

been an unknown commodity, a 
6-foot-6 quarterback who came 
to Michigan by way of Virginia 
as a sought-after recruit but 
not a surefire prospect. He was 
accustomed to adversity. Speight 
missed his junior season of high 
school with a broken collarbone, 
suffered during his team’s first 
game of the season. Schools 
backed off recruiting him, but 
Michigan came on strong after 
he returned.

During his time on campus, 

he had stayed behind the scenes. 
Speight appeared in mop-up 
duty four times before Saturday, 
attempting four passes but 
completing none. Most assumed 
the playing time was solely to 
preserve Shane Morris’ redshirt.

But Saturday, when the time 

came and Jake Rudock lay on the 
ground in pain, it was Speight 
who entered the game, Speight 
whose arm Michigan’s prayers 
rested upon.

He looked shaky at first, airing 

out passes that never had a shot. 
Harbaugh noticed, too. The 
coach started “pounding on” his 
quarterback on the sidelines, 
hitting his shoulder pads to 
simulate the sensation of getting 
hit.

So when Speight took the 

field with 8:36 remaining in the 
game and his team trailing by 
five, he was ready. He completed 
one pass to Jake Butt, and then 
another to Khalid Hill after 
De’Veon Smith ran for a first 
down. He was rolling.

Michigan drove toward 

Minnesota’s rambunctious 

student section, where they 
chanted “Jerry! Jerry!” in honor 
of former coach Jerry Kill all 
night long. On 3rd-and-10, 
he faked a handoff to Drake 
Johnson and then pulled the 
ball back in. He delivered a 
dart to Jehu Chesson in the 
back of the end zone, and the 
Wolverines once again held the 
lead. After Speight stepped up in 
the pocket and flicked the ball 
to Amara Darboh for the two-
point conversion, Michigan led 
by three.

And that’s where the score 

remained on the Golden 
Gophers’ following drive. The 
crowd yelled “Jerry! Jerry!” 
once again as music blared and 
Minnesota’s offense moved the 
ball down the field. The Golden 
Gophers got all the way to the 
half-yard line, when the nice 
man on the intercom relayed 
the Wolverines good news for 
the first time on the last drive. 
Drew Wolitarsky had not scored 
a touchdown with 19 seconds 
remaining. He had been down at 
the half-yard line.

But then, as the clock ticked 

down and down and down 
some more, just two seconds 
remained after Leidner threw an 
incomplete pass. Minnesota went 
for the score, and Michigan’s 
defense swarmed. And then it 
waited.

The seconds bled together. 

Charlton prayed and prayed. But 
then the booming voice graced 
the Wolverines with its presence. 
Leidner was ruled down.

Harbaugh threw his hands 

into the air. Durkin high-fived 
everyone in sight. Michigan’s 
players, an entire mass of them, 
rushed Minnesota’s sideline.

They didn’t know where the 

Little Brown Jug was, but they 
wanted it in their hands. It had 
spent the year in Minneapolis, 
the place where they did not 
believe it belonged. It didn’t take 
too long for them to find it. Jabrill 
Peppers emerged from the scrum, 

holding the trophy up in his arms 
while his teammates touched it.

Jon Falk, the former 

equipment manager and keeper 
of the jug, smiled as he watched 
the celebration unfold. The 
players ran around with the 
trophy, back and forth. They 
remembered last year’s game, 
when they lost the trophy for the 
first time since 2005.

“We got the f---ing trophy 

back,” one player yelled.

They brought it into 

the tunnel, where some of 
Michigan’s key players lingered 
for a moment longer, taking 
everything in. Captain Joe 
Bolden hugged everyone in sight, 
including Rudock, the starting 
quarterback’s jersey caked 
brown with turf stains. Desmond 
Morgan, a fifth-year senior, 
embraced the younger Speight, 
pulling him in tight.

Speight had done what once 

seemed hopeless, when his first 
few passes fell to the ground. He 
played it cool in his postgame 
press conference, saying he did 
nothing more than be ready like 
Harbaugh always tells him to 
be. After all, Speight said, you’re 
probably a fool if you don’t listen 
to Jim Harbaugh.

Harbaugh hoped Saturday’s 

game provided a lesson for his 
team, one that will stick with his 
players for the rest of their lives, 
until they’re 80 or 90 years old.

“You don’t give up,” Harbaugh 

said. “You keep fighting, keep 
playing.”

And then, when you’ve fought 

for every last half-yard, when 
you’ve been through heartbreak 
and hell and back again, when 
you’ve lost your starting 
quarterback and have inserted 
enough steel in your spine to 
build a skyscraper, maybe, just 
maybe, all of your prayers will be 
answered.

The good, bad and the 
ugly: ‘M’ vs. Minnesota

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

If nothing else, the No. 16 

Michigan 
football 
team 
is 

entertaining. After losing their 
previous game to Michigan State 
on a devastating final play, the 
Wolverines got to experience the 
other side of the coin Saturday, 
making a goal-line stand to beat 
Minnesota, 29-26.

As with any close game, 

there’s plenty to take away from 
Michigan’s win. The Daily breaks 
down the good, the bad and the 
ugly from Saturday night.

The good

The 
good 
news 
is 
that 

Michigan didn’t lose in the final 
seconds of the game.

Jokes aside, the Wolverines’ 

performance didn’t look “good” 
on paper, but the ability to win 
close games is a critical skill for 
Michigan to develop. In games 
decided by 10 points or fewer 
since 2012, the Wolverines had 
gone just 8-12, including an 0-2 
mark this season.

And while a strong argument 

could be made that Minnesota 
blew 
the 
game 
more 
than 

Michigan won it, a win is a win 
nonetheless.

So 
is 
bowl 
eligibility, 
as 

Michigan guaranteed itself a 
postseason game for the 40th 
time in 45 seasons.

Beyond team success, redshirt 

freshman safety Jabrill Peppers 
was as good as he has been in 
his career at Michigan. Seeing 
his role on offense expanded 
considerably, 
Peppers 
played 

more than 90 snaps Saturday 
night, 
earning 
a 
rushing 

touchdown, two pass breakups, 
100 all-purpose yards and plenty 
of near-highlight plays.

The bad

 As explosive as Peppers was, 

Saturday’s game — and Michigan’s 
season — almost blew up in a bad 
way for the Wolverines. Prior 
to Saturday, Michigan had been 
relatively fortunate in the injury 

department, keeping the offense 
intact and only losing sophomore 
defensive tackle Bryan Mone 
and senior defensive end Mario 
Ojemudia to severe injuries.

But midway through the third 

quarter, the wheels began to 
fall off when fifth-year senior 
quarterback Jake Rudock left 
the game with an injury. On 
ensuing drives, junior running 
back De’Veon Smith and junior 
tight end Jake Butt, who led the 
team in rushing and receiving, 
respectively before the game, 
were taken out as well.

Both Butt and Smith returned 

later, and redshirt freshman 
Wilton 
Speight 
performed 

honorably in Rudock’s absence, 
but the drop-off in production 
was clear.

The ugly

The game’s finish will be what 

fans remember, but the most 
surprising note from Saturday’s 
game may well have been the 
sudden collapse of the Michigan 
defense. Entering the game first 
in the nation in points and yards 
allowed per game, the Wolverines 
were expected to shut down, if 
not shut out, the Golden Gophers.

Instead, Minnesota, entering 

the night as the Big Ten’s lowest-
scoring and worst total offense, 
gashed Michigan for a season-
high 461 yards to go with 26 
points.

Quarterback Mitch Leidner 

threw for a career-high 317 
passing yards, and the Golden 
Gophers had four plays of 30 
yards of more. The Wolverines 
had only allowed five such plays 
in their first seven games this 
season.

“We’ve got to go back and 

self-check ourselves and watch 
this film intently to clean that 
stuff up,” said senior linebacker 
Desmond Morgan. “It feels better 
watching this film with a win 
than a loss.”

Michigan survived the scare 

and won, but the ugly truth is 
that based on its performance 
and costly mistakes, it probably 
shouldn’t have.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN

Saturday beckons, ready or not

T

hey didn’t prepare for this. 
They couldn’t have. Since 
the spring, Michigan 

and Minnesota have prepared 
for the game 
they played 
Saturday 
night in 
Minneapolis. 
They 
organized 
personnel, and 
they installed 
schemes.

But the 

game didn’t 
warn either 
team of what happened in the two 
weeks leading up to Saturday. By 
now, you know the stories: The 
Wolverines had a win in their 
grasp against rival Michigan 
State before the Spartans picked 
up a fumbled snap on a punt and 
returned it for a touchdown with 
no time left.

The Golden Gophers lost to 

Nebraska on the same day, 48-25, 
but that paled in comparison 
to what they lost Wednesday. 
That morning, head coach Jerry 
Kill announced his retirement 
amid health concerns. In three 
days, Minnesota would have 
to play without Kill. Defensive 
coordinator Tracy Claeys took 
over and tried to get his team 
ready.

“It’s our obligation to be ready 

to go on Saturday,” Claeys said. 
“That’s one thing this game 
teaches you — it’s for tough 
people. I believe that. Tough 
people get through tough times.”

And the game didn’t warn 

either team of the final play, 
either. Fifty-nine minutes and 
58 seconds of football had boiled 
down to this: Wolverines 29, 
Golden Gophers 26, Minnesota 
ball at the Michigan half-yard 
line.

Best push wins.
The crowd of 50,709 at TCF 

Bank Stadium watched in agony. 

Maybe the teams were ready. 
Maybe they had recovered from 
the adversity of the past two 
weeks. Maybe they hadn’t.

It didn’t matter. The play was 

coming anyway, ready or not.

Minnesota called its last 

timeout to draw up the play. The 
play clock wound down, and 
time seemed to crawl by. There 
was no escaping. The collision 
would transpire at the line of 
scrimmage. One team would win, 
grab the Little Brown Jug and 
start celebrating. The other would 
lose, go home and try to recover 
from more heartbreak.

The former was Michigan. The 

Wolverines stood firm, jumped 
the snap and stopped Minnesota 
quarterback Mitch Leidner shy 
of the goal line. They played a 
second straight game decided 
on the final play but redeemed 
themselves this time. They were 

heading home at 6-2 with the 
Little Brown Jug.

The latter was Minnesota. 

The Golden Gophers went for it 
all, trying to punch in the game-
winning touchdown rather than 
kick a field goal and play for 
overtime. They said all week they 
would try to win for Kill, and they 
put it all on the line, only to come 
up short.

The chants came from the 

crowd all night: “JER-RY! JER-
RY! JER-RY!” The first came 
when Claeys was introduced 
before the game. Another began 
after a video tribute to Kill played 
on the big screen during the first 
stoppage of play. The last chant 
occurred when Minnesota faced 
1st-and-goal from the half-yard 
line, trying to secure the win.

The Golden Gophers had 

played without Kill before — he 
missed seven games in 2013 due to 

his health — but he always came 
back. Until this week, he had no 
reported incidents since that leave 
of absence, and Claeys said last 
week he had stopped worrying 
about it until Kill stepped down 
Wednesday. That left Claeys, his 
longtime assistant, to pick up the 
pieces.

“Is it a challenge? Sure, 

it’s a challenge,” Claeys said 
Wednesday. “But hey, life’s a 
challenge. Every day is, and you 
get up in the morning, it’s a new 
day and we’ll go attack it.”

Kill informed the team of 

his decision early Wednesday 
morning, and the Golden Gophers 
had to move on and adjust. The 
players made it to class that 
day, returned to practice that 
afternoon and turned in a gutsy 
effort Saturday.

They put up 26 points against 

what was the nation’s top scoring 

defense. Leidner was their leader, 
with 354 total yards and two 
touchdowns. He opened his night 
by running around frantically 
in front of the student section, 
carrying a maroon flag that read 
“JERRYSOTA” to fire up the 
crowd.

“Coach Kill is so important to 

the state of Minnesota,” Leidner 
told reporters after the game. 
“The entire student section 
loves him. He’s done so much 
for this team, this program. I 
was honored to be able to do that 
tonight.

“They asked me earlier in the 

week if I wanted to do it, and I 
said, ‘Hell yeah, I want to do that. 
I want to do that so badly.’ To get 
the opportunity to do that tonight 
for Coach Kill is something I’ll 
never forget.”

He almost ended his night on 

a similar high. His pass to Drew 

Wolitarsky with 19 seconds left 
was initially ruled a 22-yard, 
go-ahead touchdown pass. The 
crowd erupted into frenzy, until 
the video review overturned the 
touchdown, Michigan stopped 
Minnesota just short and the 
stadium went silent.

That was the position the 

Wolverines were in just two weeks 
ago. They, too, had to regroup. 
Coach Jim Harbaugh vowed the 
Wolverines would put steel in 
their spines to recover. The players 
insisted they moved on and were 
preparing for another game. Fifth-
year senior punter Blake O’Neill 
and senior linebacker Joe Bolden, 
who took the biggest blows from 
the loss, rose back up, dusted 
themselves off and readied for 
another Saturday.

But there was no way of 

preparing for that kind of 
situation, no way of knowing what 
would happen next. Saturdays are 
like that sometimes.

They twist and turn 

throughout the day, spinning 
emotions and shifting momentum 
back and forth until finally, four 
hours later, it all comes down to 
one play.

There’s no preparing for that 

either. You do everything you can, 
work as hard as you can and show 
up. There’s no play call for when 
a coach has two seizures on the 
Tuesday of game week and has to 
step down. There’s no defensive 
scheme for letting a huge win slip 
away on a fumbled punt return as 
time expires.

There was none of that. They 

lined up, and Michigan emerged 
victorious.

That was it. The game chose a 

winner and a loser. Now they both 
go forward from that. Five days 
from now, another Saturday will 
beckon, ready or not.

‘M’ onto semifinals

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY

For the Daily

A battle occurred Sunday 

afternoon 
between 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer 
team 
and 

Northwestern as the two teams 
faced off in the quarterfinals 
of the Big Ten Tournament. 
Possession was back and forth, as 
neither team was able to establish 
a rhythm at the beginning of the 
match.

But Michigan was able to 

break through in the second 
half and advance in the Big Ten 
Tournament with a 1-0 victory.

The Wildcats (7-4-1 Big Ten, 

13-5-2 overall) put up impressive 
defensive efforts in the first half 
to almost entirely shut down 
the Wolverine offense, allowing 
the Michigan unit just four 
shots and making it difficult for 
the Wolverines to create good 
opportunities. 

“Northwestern 
threw 
a 

different system at us than we 
expected,” said Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan.

Northwestern’s 
first 
shot 

came 20 minutes into the first 
half. Both the Wolverines and 
the Wildcats traded shots, but 

ended the first half unable to find 
the back of the net. The first half 
concluded with four shots for 
the Wolverines and three for the 
Wildcats.

Despite 
being 
shut 
down 

on offense, Ryan still believed 
the Wolverines (7-3-2, 12-6-2) 
would come out victorious after 
halftime, and he commended 
his players’ “tactical ability” 
in counteracting the Wildcats’ 
defensive efforts.

Both teams struggled to find 

fluidity in their pace due to 
physical play from both sides, 
resulting in fouls and free kicks. 
Free kicks created unsettled 
balls, not made any easier for 
the defense by the artificial turf, 
which caused the ball to bounce 
more and roll quicker. Michigan 
knew the field was going to pose 
a problem, and it came prepared 
as the Wolverines practiced 
indoors on turf all week.

Michigan 
did 
not 
waste 

any time once the second half 
began. In a matter of three 
minutes, redshirt sophomore Ani 
Sarkisian took a shot, but it was 
junior forward Nicky Waldeck 
who put the Wolverines up, 
1-0. Waldeck received a cross 
from senior forward Corinne 
Harris and was able to kick it to 
the lower corner, just out of the 

Wildcat goalkeeper’s reach.

Play 
only 
became 
more 

physical 
as 
Northwestern 

desperately tried to earn an 
equalizer. Five yellow cards were 
issued, one each to Harris, senior 
midfielder 
Christina 
Murillo, 

senior 
defender 
Christina 

Ordonez 
and 
Northwestern 

midfielder 
Nandi 
Mehta. 

Michigan even picked up a 
yellow card as a team, proving 
the referees were desperate to 
keep the game under control.

Desperate to tie the match, the 

Wildcats continued to push more 
and more players up. However, the 
Wolverines settled themselves in 
a defensive stance and looked to 
maintain their 1-0 lead.

In the end, Northwestern’s 

efforts were not enough for the 
strong Michigan defense, and 
sophomore goalkeeper Megan 
Hinz earned herself a shutout.

“Postseason soccer is definitely 

more intense,” Waldeck said. 
“We knew that coming into the 
game. Our season was on the 
line tonight, and that was our 
main focus going into the game, 
and we just want to keep playing 
game by game.”

With 
Sunday’s 
win, 
the 

Wolverines secured a spot in the 
semifinal match against Penn 
State on Friday.

Wolverines keep 
Big Bear Trophy

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

The context was perfect for a 

sports movie: An injured player 
returns 
to 

his 
team 

and scores 
the winning 
goal in front of his parents. In the 
Michigan men’s soccer team’s 
1-0 victory on Saturday over 
Michigan State, that’s exactly 
what happened.

Senior forward James Murphy 

returned to the pitch for just the 
second time since Sept. 11 and led 
his team to victory. In the 24th 
minute, he headed a beautiful cross 
by junior midfielder Rylee Woods 
into the net for the Wolverines’ 
(3-2-2, Big Ten, 8-4-4 overall) only 
goal to defeat the Spartans (2-3-2, 
8-7-2) in the Battle for Big Bear at 
U-M Soccer Stadium. 

“(It) was a storybook ending 

for him to score the goal,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley.

Murphy, a native of Oxford, 

England, had the chance to play 
in front of his family for the first 
time in his collegiate career.

After playing for just 30 minutes 

in 
Tuesday’s 
match 
against 

Western Michigan, Murphy kept 
himself fit and active throughout 
the week in preparation for the 
Battle for Big Bear, playing 61 
minutes in the victory. Since he is 
from a different country, Murphy 
adds a different perspective to the 
rivalry.

“I think that’s what makes it so 

cool,” Murphy said. “I don’t think 
there’s another game in college 
soccer like it.”

The 
Wolverines 
controlled 

possession and shots throughout 
the 
first 
half, 
outshooting 

Michigan State, 5-0.

“In the first half, I thought we 

passed the ball well, attacked well 
and defended really well,” Daley 

said. “We didn’t give them a sniff 
and got the goal we needed, and 
just battened down the hatches in 
the second half.”

In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 

Wolverines 
maintained 
the 

lead with smart play and a 
controversial call in their favor.

In the 78th minute, Woods 

appeared to have used his hands 
in the penalty box, but the referees 
did not blow the whistle, much to 
the disappointment of Michigan 
State’s players and coaching staff.

Michigan 
was 
missing 
its 

leading scorer, freshman forward 
Francis Atuahene, because he 
received a red card in Michigan’s 
scoreless 
draw 
Tuesday. 

Freshman 
defender 
Marcello 

Borges, who tore his quadricep 
minutes before game time, did not 
take the field either. 

In 
their 
places, 
senior 

midfielder 
William 
Mellors-

Blair and junior midfielder Tyler 
Anderson stepped up to lead the 
Wolverines. Anderson led the 
team in shots with five. Mellors-
Blair crossed in a shot from 
Anderson but was blocked on a 
great save from Michigan State 
goalkeeper Zach Bennett in the 
29th minute.

For both Murphy and Daley, the 

game had significant meaning, as 
Murphy was Daley’s first recruit 
as the Wolverines’ head coach.

“James Murphy has scored 

every big goal for this program 
since I’ve been here,” Daley said.

Murphy 
understands 
the 

significance of not only this last 
season but also of this rivalry 
game. He won the game in his 
freshman year, junior year and 
now in his senior year.

When he scored the goal, it 

added more icing to the cake.

“I think I just blanked out,” 

Murphy said. “I ran over to my 
family, gave them a little wave 
and I just kinda blanked out.”

‘M’ disappointed by 
second-place finish

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s cross 

country team has been surprising 
teams as of late, soaring to No. 2 
in the rankings after beginning 
the season outside of the top 15. 
In the NCAA Pre-Nationals, the 
Wolverines outraced four top-10 
teams in then-No. 2 Colorado, No. 
4 Oregon, No. 7 Georgetown and 
No. 9 Stanford.

But this week at the Big Ten 

Championships in Chicago, it 
was Michigan that was surprised. 
No. 15 Penn State squeaked past 
the Wolverines to claim the title, 
halting Michigan’s win streak.

The Wolverines finished in 

second place with 58 points, five 
behind the Nittany Lions. The 
two were well ahead of the rest 
of the competition, as the other 
12 teams in the field, including 
No. 21 Michigan State and No. 
22 Minnesota, had at least 104 
points.

The course at Sydney R. 

Marovitz 
Golf 
Course 
was 

challenging and presented racers 
with hilly terrain and muddy 
conditions. But junior Erin Finn 
didn’t think the difficulty of the 
course had much to do with her 
team’s outcome.

“I think we have performed 

better on more difficult courses 
because we’re a very strong team,” 
Finn said. “We can run hills, and 
we can run through mud. I think 
more than anything, it just wasn’t 
our day.”

Finn once again led the pack 

for 
Michigan, 
finishing 
first 

to capture her second Big Ten 
individual title. She became the 
second athlete in program history 
to do so — joining decorated alum 
Katie McGregor, who won the 
race in 1997 and 1998. Finn’s time 
of 19:44 was a personal best, 15 
seconds faster than her previous 
for a 6,000-meter race.

“Whenever your name is next 

to someone like Katie McGregor, 
it’s definitely very special,” Finn 
said. “She is an incredible athlete 

and did incredible things in 
college and after, so it definitely 
bodes well for the future. So I’m 
really excited to kind of follow the 
path that she followed.”

Redshirt sophomores Jamie 

Phelan and Gina Sereno rounded 
out the Wolverine finishers in the 
top 10, placing eighth and 10th, 
respectively. Redshirt sophomore 
Sophie Linn crossed the finish 
line in 18th place with a time of 
20:34. Senior Shannon Osika was 
the final scoring runner, running 
a 20:46 clip, good for 21st place. 
Linn’s 
performance 
was 
the 

second personal best, along with 
Finn, out of the scoring five.

The remaining Wolverines in 

the race — fifth-year senior Anna 
Pasternak, redshirt sophomore 
Jamie 
Morrissey, 
redshirt 

sophomore Courtney Munley and 
senior Taylor Manett placed 23rd, 
26th, 29th and 43rd, respectively. 
Pasternak, 
Morrissey, 
and 

Munley all set personal bests.

Though the team’s result was 

disappointing, 
Michigan 
isn’t 

letting the setback get the best of 
it. McGuire said his team entered 
the race together as a unit and 
will leave as one as well. He noted 
there is still a lot of the season left, 
giving his team time to improve 
and perform well once the NCAA 
Championships come around.

The Wolverines are in a better 

position this time of the year than 
they were last season, when two 
of their top runners were unable 
to race due to injury. It’s just a 
matter of having the best race 
possible from now until the end of 
the season.

“We just have to trust in our 

training and trust in our process,” 
Finn said. “We have to just believe 
in what we do, and you can’t have 
a bad day every time out. We’re 
not going to change much. We’re 
going to move forward, what’s 
done is done. We’re disappointed, 
but not devastated.”

Wolverines win 
conference title

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Confidence is the ability 

to stand on the starting line 
knowing 
your 
team 
could 

win. It’s the ability for nine 
Michigan men to race, ready to 
give it their all. 

It’s the feeling of winning the 

Big Ten title. 

“We started the season with 

this goal in mind — we were 
focused,” said fifth-year senior 
Mason Ferlic. “I saw everyone 
training with a purpose and 
everybody 
showing 
up 
to 

practice with a purpose. These 
nine 
guys 
did 
something 

special. Other teams can talk all 
they want, but it’s the team that 
gets it done that wins. That feels 
good.” 

This weekend, the No. 5 

men’s 
cross 
country 
team 

traveled to Chicago for the Big 
Ten Championships. They came 
back as champions for just the 
10th time in program history 
and the first time since 1998. 

“My job is to give my athletes 

the tools to line up and compete 
at 
championships,” 
said 

Michigan coach Kevin Sullivan. 
“When the gun goes off, the race 
is on them. It’s up to my runners 
to decide how they want to 
place. This is about them doing 
something for themselves and 
Michigan.”

To date, Ferlic has led the 

Wolverines in 17 consecutive 
races and seven postseason 
competitions. 
He 
is 
the 

highest-scoring 
Michigan 

individual since 2001 and was 
made an All-Big Ten First 
Team honoree. 

At 1,000 meters after the start 

of the race, Ferlic watched as 
a Wisconsin athlete ran ahead 
of the pack. At 4,000 meters, 
Ferlic knew the moment was 
coming up to make his move and 
close the gap between him and 
the leading athlete. At 5,000 
meters, the course became a 
three-man race between Ferlic 

and runners from Purdue and 
Illinois. 

And at the finish line, 8,000 

meters from the start, Ferlic 
placed second with a personal 
best of 23:19.6. 

“I’m proud that (Ferlic) put 

it all on the line,” Sullivan said. 
“That’s exactly what I ask the 
guys to do. I’ve been in this 
position (as a former Michigan 
athlete), so it was exciting to 
see the program get back to 
where we wanted to be for the 
last 15 years. It was surreal and 
exciting and interesting to be 
where we stood today.” 

Second 
of 
the 
Michigan 

scorers was junior co-captain 
Ben 
Flanagan, 
who 
placed 

eighth with a time of 23:42.6. 
Exactly one second later, senior 
Tony Smoragiewicz finished 
the course. Both of their times 
qualified them as second-team 
honorees. Rounding out the 
other Michigan scorers were 
junior Connor Mora in 19th and 
redshirt junior Nick Renberg 
in 25th. It was Renberg’s first 
time competing in the Big Ten 
Championships. 

The remaining competing 

athletes 
included 
redshirt 

sophomore Micah Beller, his 
classmate Aaron Baumgarten, 
fifth-year senior Nick Posada 
and 
his 
classmate 
August 

Pappas. 

Smoragiewicz, 
Mora, 

Renberg, Beller and Baumgarten 
all ran personal bests. 

“I do my very best in my 

leadership role,” Flanagan said. 
“But even though I know I’m 
considered a co-captain, at 
the end of the day, I see nine 
captains on this team.” 

It was a weekend of big 

numbers. All five Michigan 
scorers made it into the top 25. 
Three all-conference runners 
competed. Ferlic earned second. 

But the number that counts 

the most is one. For the first 
time since 1998 Michigan is the 
Big Ten Champions. And that 
confidence will last forever. 

WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY

three days after head coach Jerry 
Kill retired due to health con-
cerns, interim coach Tracy Claeys 
went for the win.

Leidner ran a quarterback 

sneak with two seconds left, but 
he was stuffed short, and Michi-
gan reclaimed the Little Brown 
Jug.

“We like to call that giving us 

a place to stand,” said redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers. 
“We got it down at the half-inch-
yard line, I don’t know how much 
closer you can get.

“I thought they were gonna try 

to do one of their trick plays, but 
we felt good thinking that they 
were gonna go sneak, and they 
went sneak, and the big guys up 
front blew up the line of scrim-
mage and we came out of here 
with a victory.”

The Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 

6-2 overall) have been able to 
rely on their defense all season 
to escape tricky situations. Sat-
urday night was about as tricky 
as it gets.

Even outside of Minnesota’s 

final drive, the game was filled 
with theatrics, highlighted by an 
unsung hero, redshirt freshman 
quarterback Wilton Speight, who 
threw his first career touchdown 
to put the Wolverines ahead late.

With 4:27 left in the third quar-

ter, Golden Gophers defensive end 
Andrew Stelter laid a fierce hit on 
fifth-year senior quarterback Jake 
Rudock as Rudock began sliding 
to the ground after a scramble.

Rudock left the game and did 

not return, throwing Speight into 
the fire. Coming into the game, 
Speight had not completed a pass 
all season. Fittingly, he struggled 
at first, failing to earn a first down 
his first three series.

“The first couple drives, I was 

not really comfortable,” Speight 
said. “I was probably flushing 
myself out of the pocket when I 
did not need to.

“I talked to (passing game 

coordinator Jedd) Fisch on the 
phone before that last drive and 
he said, ‘Look, just relax and 
have fun and smile because we 
know you can do it, and the team 
believes in you, so just go out and 
do what you can.’ ”

Starting on the Minnesota 

40-yard line with eight and a half 
minutes left, after the Michigan 
defense forced a crucial three-
and-out, Speight completed an 
eight-yard pass to junior tight 
end Jake Butt on first down. It 
was his first completion of the 
season, and it set the tone for the 
entire drive.

Speight found redshirt sopho-

more tight end Khalid Hill to get 
to the red zone, and four plays 
later, at the 12-yard line, Speight 
made the biggest play of his young 
career.

With 4:57 remaining, he found 

redshirt junior receiver Jehu 
Chesson in the back of the end 
zone over the middle, putting 
Michigan up by one. Speight then 
connected with redshirt junior 
receiver Amara Darboh for the 
two-point conversion on the next 
play.

“What an invaluable learning 

experience for Wilton Speight,” 
Harbaugh said. “To get his first 
action and do it with a fourth-
quarter comeback, and then kind 
of dramatic style. That’ll be really 
good for his confidence as well.”

Before Rudock’s injury, and far 

before the final drive, the Wolver-
ines looked to be in trouble, espe-
cially after they let a 14-3 lead slip 
away at the half.

Minnesota (1-3, 4-4) opened 

the scoring with a field goal 4:47 
into the game, but Peppers turned 
two returns into great field posi-
tion for the Wolverines. Michigan 
capitalized on both, as Rudock 
found Chesson for one touch-
down, and Peppers ran in another 
out of the wildcat formation, put-
ting Michigan up by 11 early in the 
second quarter.

Peppers was indispensable for 

the Wolverines, turning in 100 
all-purpose yards and his first 
career touchdown.

“I tried to do what I am coached 

to do and get us in the best posi-
tion possible,” Peppers said. “That 
definitely worked well tonight.”

But Leidner brought Minne-

sota back, throwing a 52-yard 
touchdown to Rashad Still and 
leading two field goal drives to 
give the Golden Gophers a 16-14 
lead at the half. Leidner finished 
with 317 yards passing, but even 
that wasn’t enough to earn the 
win.

If he had thrown for 318, it may 

have been.

Robert Morris blanks 
Michigan at Yost, 4-0

Wolverines come 

out flat, split 
weekend series 
after shutout

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

It has been the same old story 

for the Michigan hockey team. 
Not 
the 

one where 
it 
scores 

five 
goals 

a game, but the one where it has 
multiple defensive breakdowns.

And unlike previous games, the 

offense couldn’t bail out its sloppy 
defensive play.

Saturday, in their series finale 

against 
Robert 
Morris, 
the 

10th-ranked Wolverines fell to 
Robert Morris, 4-0. Most of the 
Colonials’ chances stemmed from 
defensive breakdowns that led 
to multiple odd-man rushes and 
grade-A scoring chances.

“You have to be just as hungry 

coming into this game as we 
were the game last night, or 
you’re going to get this kind of 
result,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “You got to come 
out hungry and desperate every 
night, and anything short of that 
isn’t good enough. The game is all 
defense and goalkeeping, and if 
you’re solid there, it’s going to be 
a close game.”

Three minutes into the game, 

Michigan failed to clear the puck 
from the zone, which led to an 
odd-man rush for the Colonials 
(3-1-2). Robert Morris forward 
Brandon Denham corralled a 
rebound from junior netminder 
Zach Nagelvoort, who made the 
initial save, and beat the goalie via 
the five hole.

And just like the Colonials’ 

first goal, an odd-man rush led to 

another glorious opportunity, and 
forward Daniel Leavens took full 
advantage. Leavens received the 
puck in the slot and sniped one 
over Nagelvoort’s glove.

Robert 
Morris 
maintained 

all the momentum throughout 
the first period. With 57 seconds 
left, the Colonials won a faceoff 
in Michigan’s zone, distributed 
the puck well and defenseman 
Tyson Wilson skated through 
the slot and backhanded one past 
Nagelvoort. The Wolverines had 
multiple opportunities to clear 
the puck.

“You have to say the game 

was decided in the first period,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“I 
told 

my team this 
morning 
that 

there would be 
one team that 
would 
come 

out 
hungrier 

than 
the 

other. In these 
afternoon 
games, 
that’s 

how it works. We thought we’d be 
that team, but we weren’t.”

The three first-period goals 

were all Berenson needed to see 
before making a goalie change. 
Berenson opted for senior Steve 
Racine to finish the game. So for 
now, the revolving door that is the 
Wolverines’ goaltending situation 
will remain spinning.

Racine looked better Saturday, 

stopping 24 shots and allowing 
only 
one 
goal. 
It’s 
a 
vast 

improvement for the senior who 
allowed nine total goals in his first 
two starts.

“We put Nagelvoort in after 

he came off of his best game,” 
Berenson said. “We all thought he 
would just continue that. He’s in a 
groove, had confidence, was into 
it and then you saw tonight.

“The goalies all look at the 

goals and say, ‘Is that something 

I should save?’ And I think he 
would tell you honestly, ‘that’s on 
me.’ When you give them a goal 
that you can save 95 percent of 
the time, that just kills your team. 
This is Division I hockey; this isn’t 
Bantam hockey.”

Robert Morris’ fourth goal 

came on yet another defensive 
mistake. The Wolverines failed 
to clear the puck from the crease 
multiple times, which led to 
forward Zac Lynch putting one 
past Racine.

Michigan (4-1-1) had multiple 

grade-A chances in the first 
period, 
including 
one 
by 

sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 

Werenski, 
whose 
hard 

shot 
from 

the blue line 
found its way 
through to the 
net and rolled 
through 
the 

crease before it 
was cleared.

Werenski 

nearly 
scored 

again in the third period when, 
on a power play, he fired one at 
Robert Morris netminder Dalton 
Izyk, who made a sprawling pad 
save.

Izyk 
had 
a 
blemish-free 

afternoon, stopping all 34 shots 
he faced. It was the first time 
Michigan had been shut out 
since Feb. 14 when it played at 
Minnesota.

A win over the Colonials on 

Saturday would’ve given the 
Wolverines their best start since 
the 2000-01 season. Instead, the 
Wolverines were left with their 
first loss of the season from a 
game that Berenson said had “no 
positives.”

So for now, Michigan will 

have to worry about fixing their 
sloppy defensive play or outcomes 
like Saturdays could become a 
commonality.

A minor identity

crisis at Yost

T

he Michigan hockey 
team split a pair of home 
games this weekend 

against an unheralded, but very 
competitive, Robert Morris 
squad. No, it’s not the end of the 
Wolverines’ 
NCAA 
tournament 
hopes or an 
indication 
that 
Michigan 
doesn’t 
deserve its 
lofty top-10 
ranking.

But the 

loss does pose an unsettling 
question — when the Wolverines 
aren’t ‘The Comeback Kids,’ who 
are they?

Michigan is 4-1-1 this season 

and has scored as many goals in 
the third period as the first and 
second combined. It makes for 
fun hockey, but relying on late 
goals to win is not a recipe for 
sustained success.

Saturday’s 4-0 drubbing 

at the hands of the Colonials 
seemed to sober the giddy 
excitement of a previously 
undefeated team.

It is fair to say that the 

matchup was not ideal for the 
Wolverines. Robert Morris is 
a big, physical hockey team 
loaded with seniors. Colonials 
goaltender Dalton Izyk was 
unflappable in net, shutting out 
Michigan at Yost Ice Arena for 
the first time since 2009 on 34 
saves.

Still, the home team looked 

altogether lost on Saturday. 
The Wolverines had trouble 
breaking out of the defensive 
zone cleanly, and particularly 
struggled getting to the net on 
offense.

Michigan coach Red 

Berenson attributed the loss to 

a complete lack of preparation, 
saying that he didn’t see any 
positive takeaways from 
the game. He complained of 
underwhelming goaltending 
from senior netminder Zach 
Nagelvoort, who started, and a 
lack of effort from the forwards.

“I didn’t think that we were as 

hungry or as desperate or ready 
to pay the price in front of their 
net,” Berenson said. “We were 
one-and-done, and we weren’t 
stopping on loose pucks. We 
were escaping. Sometimes you 
get away with that and the puck 
goes in, but it wasn’t going in.”

The Wolverines are a 

versatile group of players full of 
NHL draft picks and other top 
talent, but a team’s identity is 
a game plan that it can turn to 
when nothing else is working.

Michigan’s problem is 

pinpointing that identity.

“We just need to play fast,” 

said junior 
forward 
Justin Selman. 
“We’re a fast 
team. We’re a 
skilled team. 
We need to 
possess the 
puck down 
low, just be a little bit crisper. 
Once everyone has that jump 
in their stride, once everyone is 
moving the puck with a little bit 
of zip, we’re a much better team. 
I think we were chasing the 
puck a little too much tonight.”

Playing fast does help, but 

it seems unlikely to be a cure-
all. The Wolverines looked 
lethargic at times Saturday, 
but more concerning was 
the lack of team play. As the 
game wore on and frustration 
mounted, Michigan players 
stopped looking to pass, instead 
carrying the puck into multiple 
defenders.

Robert Morris, content to 

let the poor quality attacks 
continue, turned away most of 
the rushes easily.

This type of individual play 

is the hallmark of a team that is 
uncomfortable playing together. 
But then again, why should 
the Wolverines be comfortable 
playing together just yet? This 
is a team reliant on young talent 
at both ends of the ice, just a few 
weeks into the season. There 
may be cause for concern, but 
certainly not alarm.

Freshman forwards Cooper 

Marody and Kyle Connor are 
tied for the team lead in points 
(7) and goals (3). On defense, 
three of the top six contributors 
are not yet 19 years old.

There were some bright 

spots in the game for Michigan 
as well. Selman, Marody and 
senior forward JT Compher all 
continued to crash the net on 

offense, a kind 
of hard-nosed 
hockey perfect 
for scoring 
goals in tight 
games.

To find a 

way to win 
consistently 

this season, though, the 
Wolverines need more. The 
team must play to its strengths 
— not just in the third period, 
but all game. Michigan is a fast 
team with deep talent. Puck 
movement and a willingness 
to sell out the body for a goal 
is what can separate the 
Wolverines from the pack of 
teams trying to wrench away 
their NCAA Tournament hopes.

Saturday’s loss should be 

warning enough.
