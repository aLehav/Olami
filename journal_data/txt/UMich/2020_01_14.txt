ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The University of Michigan 
Senate Assembly met Monday 
afternoon at the Michigan 
League to discuss the structure 
of faculty governance, changes 
to policy regarding faculty pay 
during University misconduct 
trials, the status of U-M Flint 
and the purpose of University 
Ombuds. The Ombuds is an 
independent 
body 
working 
to resolve conflicts between 
faculty members. 
MaryJo Banasik, director 
of the University’s Faculty 
Senate Office, began with a 

presentation explaining the 
structure of the University’s 
faculty governance. 
“There’s 
an 
opportunity 
for the faculty to reach all 
these 
different 
levels 
of 
administration, but it really 
needs to be done through 
central faculty government,” 
Banasik said. “So when people 
do 
get 
involved 
— 
when 
they participate in faculty 
governments — that’s when 
faculty voices can be heard the 
most.” 
Ann Sales, a professor of 
Learning Health Sciences in 
the Medical School, raised 
concerns with the lack of 

representation of University 
staff on faculty governance. 
“When we went through 
the list of who was involved 
in faculty governance as it’s 
currently set up, there are 
clearly some important groups 
missing,” 
Sales 
said. 
“So 
critical faculty are missing, 
as are lecturers and other 
adjunct roles, and I’m sure this 
gets addressed frequently, but 
are there mechanisms for this 
ongoing discussion?” 
Information 
professor 
Kentaro Toyama, chair of the 
Academic 
Affairs 
Advisory 
Committee, presented updates 
on resolved and ongoing policy 

debates between the AAAC 
and the Office of the Provost. 
Toyoma 
discussed 
how 
issues of expediting tenure 
trials and cutting pay for 
egregious faculty misconduct 
have 
split 
the 
committee. 
He said he errs on the side 
of protecting faculty rights 
while recognizing the need to 
sanction harmful faculty. 
“(Faculty 
members) 
are 
paid through the time of 
the hearing until the final 
decision is made by the 
University 
whether 
to 
terminate 
them 
or 
not,” 
Toyama said. 

Approximately 100 students 
and faculty attended the first 
session of the LSA 2020 Great 
Lakes Theme Semester speaker 
series 
on 
Monday 
evening. 
The event was hosted by the 
School for Environment and 
Sustainability at the University 
of Michigan Museum of Art 
auditorium. 
The session addressed key 
issues dealing with the rising 
water levels in the Great Lakes 
and their consequences. The 
panel consisted of four speaker 
presentations 
followed 
by a question and answer 
panel moderated by Richard 
Norton, professor of Urban 
and Regional Planning and 
Program in the Environment. 
Addressing 
the 
critical 
nature of studying the Great 
Lakes’ water levels, Leland 
Township Supervisor Susan 
Och shared an experience 
from her work when she was 
at a beach on Lake Michigan 
discussing rip currents. 
“A gentleman came out of 
his house, swaying with his 
cocktail, and gave me the best 
piece of advice I could ever 
use:

Ann Arbor City Council met 
Monday night for a work session 
in conjunction with Jennifer Hall, 
executive director of the Housing 
Commission. 
The 
discussion 
surrounded the creation of more 
affordable housing in Ann Arbor. 
Approximately 60 Ann Arbor 
residents attended the meeting. 
Hall said those with an annual 
income ranging between $20,000-
60,000, around 60 percent of Ann 
Arbor’s population, would be 
eligible for these housing units.
Residents 
had 
concerns 
about these units, ranging from 
preserving historical chimneys 
to ensuring old trees remain 
in original locations. Positive 
features of the housing plan would 
be its walkability score, Low 
Income Housing Tax Credits and 
the possibility for the creation of 
mixed-use buildings. 
Hall said the building plan 
notes properties owned by the city 
that are not being used to their 
full extent, making them good 
candidates for a remodel. 
Hall, along with her colleagues, 
said the plan would require an 
experienced private developer, but 
the Housing Commission would 
still have autonomy over the plans.

Michigan Union opens after 
20 months of renovation

NATALIE STEPHENS/Daily
Students and staff gather around the Michigan Union to celebrate the reopening after 20 months of renovations Monday afternoon.

Twenty months and two 
new graduating classes later, 
the Michigan Union opened its 
doors Monday morning to more 
than 500 waiting students and 
alumni. 
The Michigan Union first 
opened in 1919 and has since 
served as a meeting space for 
various student organizations, 
study spaces and University 
programs. 
Renovation 
plans 
for the building began nine 
years ago through the student 
advisory 
group 
Building 

a Better Michigan and its 
coalition with Central Student 
Government, the University’s 
colleges and various student 
organizations. 
The Union’s closed its doors 
in April 2018 for renovations 
and the building has been 
under construction and closed 
to visitors since. The Union 
celebrated its 100th birthday 
on the Diag in October and The 
Daily was offered a sneak peek 
of the renovations in December.
After the doors opened, about 
one hundred people gathered 
in the courtyard of the Union 
to hear formal remarks from a 
variety of speakers, including 
E. Royster Harper, outgoing 

vice 
president 
of 
Student 
Life, 
Amy 
White, 
director 
of the Michigan Union, and 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel. Other visitors during 
this time previewed the student 
spaces and businesses housed 
in the Union.
In an interview with the 
Daily before opening remarks, 
Regent 
Paul 
Brown 
(D) 
commented on the value of the 
Union for students on campus. 
“I 
definitely 
appreciated 
the building as a student here, 
and I’m glad it’s reopened to 
the kids and hopefully more 
useful than ever,” Brown said.

Only a small handful of stores begin serving customers

Following the announcement 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Union 
restaurant 
lineup 
in 
mid-
October, 
only 
Sweetwaters 
Coffee & Tea, Blue Market 
and Barnes & Noble opened 
in the newly renovated Union 
Monday 
afternoon. 
Other 
restaurants opening later in 
the semester in the Union 
include 
favorites 
such 
as 
Subway, Panda Express and 
the new addition of Panera 
Bread and Taco Bell. 
One of the biggest draws 
of the Union may be its 
restaurants. Susan Pile, senior 

director for University Unions 
and Auxiliary Services, said 
the other franchises will be 
available to students in the 
coming weeks. 
“Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea, 
Blue Market and Barnes and 
Noble will be open,” Pile said. 
“The others will be open over 
the next couple of weeks.” 
Pile spoke about the process 
of 
selecting 
restaurants. 
Through student surveys and 
committees, Union directors 
selected 
which 
restaurants 
would be in the Union. 
“Some of the restaurants 
are 
returning, 
depending 
on where they were in their 
lease agreement,” Pile said. 

“And some of them we went 
out for what’s called a request 
for proposal process where 
we 
work 
with 
University 
procurement. Any interested 
vendors bid on the spaces and 
we worked through a selection 
process identifying a diverse 
array of menu options and 
price points and menu types.” 
Many students said they 
feared most restaurants may 
not open until after spring 
break. LSA senior Alexandra 
Niforos 
admitted 
she 
was 
fearful she would not be able 
to enjoy the Union to its fullest 
in her last semester.

Nearly five years ago, 
University 
of 
Michigan 
faculty and students and 
the Grace Girls’ Home in 
Trincomalee, 
Sri 
Lanka 
teamed up to tackle diabetes 
care in low and middle-
income communities. Now, 
organizers reflect on the 
new mentorship programs 
taking place within the 
initiative. 
Grace Girls’ Home is a 
shelter for “at-risk” girls 
and the elderly displaced 
by the 2004 tsunami in 
Sri Lanka that claimed 
40,000 lives, as well as 
the Sri Lankan civil war 
that ended in 2019, which 
resulted 
in 
more 
than 
100,000 deaths. The shelter 
provides 
residents 
with 
housing, food, education 
and medical treatment as 
necessary. 
Dr. Naresh Gunaratnam, 
a 
gastroenterologist 
at 
Huron 
Gastro 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, founded Grace Girls’ 
Home in 2002, intending to 
address the needs of girls. 
In 2004, he started an 
elder care facility to house 
elderly people who had no 
children left to take care of 
them.
“There’s 
no 
place 
to 
discharge them, so they 
would literally give them 
a mat and sleep on the 
grounds of the hospital, 
and the hospital would do 
their best to feed them,” 
Gunaratnam 
said. 
“You 
start accumulating a lot of 
these elders who had no 
place to go … At our best in 
2004-2005, we were taking 
care of 300 people.”
Grace Girls’ Home also 
provides 
residents 
with 
vocational 
training 
and 
skills 
after 
they 
leave 
the home. Sahr Yazdani, 
University 
alum 
and 

medical student at Loyola 
University 
Chicago, 
started helping out at Grace 
Girls’ Home when she was 
13 by tutoring the girls 
in 
conversational 
skills. 
Yadzani said this helped 
her realize the importance 
of the girls’ transitions 
from home.
“I 
realized 
there 
wasn’t really a transitory 
environment for these girls 
living in the orphanage 
to living in Sri Lankan 
society,” Yazdani said. “We 
renovated these complexes 
that were existing on the 
Grace Girls’ home property 
… and wanted the girls who 
were older to live in this 
transitionary environment. 
We taught them financial 
literacy and how to go into 
the market and everything 
… just to introduce those 
ideas in conversation and 
such.”
LSA senior Nikita Bazaj 
is the president of Grace-
Edu, an organization on 
campus that focuses on 
introducing these life skills 
to the girls at Grace Girls’ 
Home.
“We’re 
doing 
a 
mentorship program with 
students at U-M and the 
Grace Girls who are in high 
school,” Bazaj said. “We’re 
putting 
two 
U-M 
girls 
with one girl from Grace, 
and the fall semester was 
focused 
on 
building 
a 
relationship with the girls 
and this next semester will 
be focused on teaching 
the girls individual team 
topics. We have a different 
team topic per month and 
for 
example, 
this 
first 
month’s is finance.”
In addition to learning 
life 
skills, 
University 
fellow 
Anjan 
Saha 
has 
helped implement a recent 
program to offer the girls 
at Grace Girls’ Home new 
employment opportunities 

as 
community 
health 
workers. 
Saha 
said 
ancillary 
care 
providers 
aren’t always as trusted as 
physicians in Sri Lanka. 
“A 
lot 
of 
trust 
is 
concentrated 
with 
the 
physician,” 
Saha 
said. 
“Ancillary care providers 
don’t necessarily receive 
that same level of trust. 
That’s obviously a very 
big 
component 
of 
our 
healthcare 
system 
and 
it allows the system as a 
whole to offload some of 
the workload that would 
otherwise 
fall 
under 
the responsibility of the 
physician.”
Grace 
Girls’ 
Home 
has also partnered with 
the 
William 
Davidson 
Institute 
in 
the 
Ross 
School of Business, a non-
profit organization aimed 
at improving the delivery 
of 
care 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Gunaratnam 
said 
together, 
they 
will 
improve 
physician 
efficiency in Sri Lanka.
“When we can’t create 
more physicians, we have to 
make them more efficient,” 
Gunaratnam 
said. 
“The 
physician’s role is to deal 
with the people who are 
at most risk for dying … 
We are saying instead of 
90 
seconds, 
give 
those 
patients five minutes.” 
In August 2018, Medical 
student Monica Choo went 
to Sri Lanka to help set up 
a study examining how 
effective the community 
health 
workers 
are 
at 
providing health care and 
patient satisfaction. 
Choo 
also 
created 
a 
curriculum to train the 
 
community health workers 
in doing their job safely 
and efficiently.
“I also created a one-year 
curriculum to train them,” 
Choo said. “Ultimately, we 
want it to be a thing where 

the girls can be accredited 
nationally and hired by the 
physicians 
and 
actually 
make a living. To do that, 
we have to have a real 
curriculum like any job. I 
took some time to create 
a 
one-year 
curriculum 
and we’re in conversation 
with US Aid right now to 
see how we can get that 
leverage and get it pushed 
through the Ministry of 
Health.”
Saha 
said 
community 
health 
workers 
help 
alleviate congestion faced 
in 
the 
health 
system 
and 
implementing 
new 
vocational skills for those 
who cannot seek higher 
education.
“As 
more 
and 
more 
patients 
started 
seeing 
them 
and 
experiencing 
what it is they had to 
offer, trust was sort of 
built over time,” Saha said. 
“Since then, the operation 
has seen maybe 400-500 
patients in a number of 
provincial hospitals within 
the Eastern province.”
Gunaratnam 
said 
the 
future implications of the 
government’s support in 
this 
new 
vocation 
will 
significantly 
improve 
patient outcomes.
“The government will 
hopefully 
support 
us 
creating this new job and 
get these girls paid and so 
forth,” Gunaratnam said. 
“We believe (in) focused 
intervention, that means 
engaging with the girls 
leads to better outcomes … 
The patients like talking to 
the girls. They give them 
more 
time, 
they 
know 
them personally, there is a 
higher level of sympathy. 
When I visited, they said, 
‘They give us good advice 
about the practical things. 
The doctor doesn’t have 
time to do that.’”

“We would need to have expertise 
from a private developer, but we’d 
like to have some certainty going 
into that process, in advance, where 
we would pre-entitle the basic 
footprint of what the site would 
look like,” Hall said. 
The council discussed a variety 
of topics, ranging from the process 
of building new properties to 
parking difficulties in Ann Arbor. 
The two are closely related, as 
many of the sites that may be 
developed are parking lots. 
Community member Stephen 
Ranzini, 
president 
and 
CEO 
of 
University 
Bank, 
attended 
the event and spoke with The 
Daily about the future and new 
technologies. 
He said he thinks that despite 
the struggles with parking, in the 
future these struggles will become 
obsolete 
as 
self-driving 
cars 
and ridesharing becomes more 
affordable than personal cars. 
“Every futurist I’ve talked to is 
telling me that self-driving electric 
cars will be a reality in 10 years ... 
you know, that sounds ambitious 
right now because there’s still a lot 
of problems to solve,” Ranzini said. 
“But then again, 10 years ago, who 
was carrying a cell phone that had 
an awesome camera? Technology 
moves first slowly and then very 
rapidly.” 
Andy Tucker, Ann Arbor high 
schooler, 
discussed 
how 
the 
conversation on parking affected 
him personally. 
“The community cares a lot 
about 
parking,” 
Tucker 
said. 
“It’s been brought up in a lot of 
the discussions that they’ve had. 
I know that housing is really 
expensive and most can’t afford it. 
The discussion helped me because 
now I know more about it.” 

“It’s a valuable resource. The 
symbolism in the name alone 
is important for our campus 
and our time. It really is a 
place where we can all come 
together and be more united, 
and we can use it as a place to 
understand each other.”
The remarks started with an 
introductory video, followed 
by an acknowledgment of 
the 
University 
occupying 
formally 
Ojibwe, 
Odawa, 
and Bodewadmi tribal land. 
Alphonse 
Pitawanakwat, 
lecturer 
in 
the 
American 
Culture 
department, 
and 
Ethriam Brammer, assistant 
dean 
in 
the 
Rackham 
Graduate School, delivered 
the 
acknowledgment. 
Schlissel then spoke about 
the singularity of the Union 
in higher education and the 
importance of the building. 
“For 
generations, 
the 
Michigan Union has been a 
place where students lead, a 
place of activism and a place 
of 
student-driven 
change 
that has made us a better and 
more important university,” 
Schlissel said. “It’s my hope 
that the Union encourages 
students from all different 
backgrounds and academic 
disciplines to interact and take 
advantage of the outstanding 
breadth and diversity of our 
great university.”
As presenters were invited 
to speak, members of the 
Climate 
Action 
Movement 
lowered banners over the 

second-story 
banister 
delivering 
messages 
condemning the University 
for its alleged lack of attention 
to climate change issues. One 
banner read, “Stop fueling 
the next mass extinction.” 
This action followed a recent 
intervention of the group 
at the December Regents 
meeting. 
CSG President Ben Gerstein 
was invited to comment on 
the Union’s place as a center 
on campus for students. 
“Today’s reopening is a 
remarkable reflection of the 
power of student activism 
and the power of a collective 
student voice for change,” 
Gerstein said. “Since (the 
Union’s opening in 1919), this 
building has hosted some of 
the most significant moments 
in U of M student history, 
the constant reminder of the 
Michigan 
experience 
that 
occurs both inside and outside 
the classroom or lecture hall.”
The 
formal 
remarks 
concluded with the raising 
of the Michigan flag above 
the Union, an event that was 
live-streamed and projected 
inside the courtyard. As the 
flag was raised, the Michigan 
Band lead a chorus of “Hail 
to the Victors” and streamers 
fell from the ceiling. 
In an interview with The 
Daily 
after 
the 
remarks, 
White said throughout its 
renovation, the Union needed 
the student vision.
“As an alum and someone 
who spent a great deal of 
time at the Union, the ability 
to steward students’ visions 

through the renovation has 
been a tremendous honor,” 
White said. “In the weeks and 
months ahead, as we see how 
the building welcomes back 
students to its spaces, it will 
be great to see all that as well. 
That’s an amazing part of the 
Union as well, that students 
make it their own and should 
make it their own.”
The students The Daily 
spoke to said they appreciated 
the excitement surrounding 
student spaces and the free 
food handed out at the event. 
Taubman sophomore Kassem 
Chammout 
said 
he 
was 
excited to see the remodel.
“It’s nice to see that there’s 
money going back into the 
University and it’s not being 
torn down,” Chammout said.
LSA senior Angelina Adam 
also spoke of the differences 
between 
experiencing 
the 
building as a freshman and 
now again as a senior.
“It’s 
really 
nice 
and 
updated but it’s retained the 
original architecture, which 
is really cool, and a lot of the 
history that is in it,” Adam 
said. “It’s just more open and 
modern now. It’s a lot nicer 
and a better experience. I 
also really like the art that 
they have now and how they 
brought in a lot of different 
faces 
that 
really 
show 
Michigan spirit.”
LSA freshman Jessica Lim 
said she was excited about 
the abundance of study areas 
in the renovated Union. 
“It’s really bright, you can 
tell it has that new smell, 
I’m happy about it because 

hopefully with all this new 
lounging and study area, it 
will de-crowd some of the 
areas that have been super 
congested,” Lim said. 
LSA 
freshman 
Pulak 
Taneja also said he heard a 
lot about the Union before 
coming to the University and 
anticipated its opening. 
“There was a real buildup 
for this because ever since 
we got here as freshmen we 
were told that the Union 
used to be open, but it isn’t 
open anymore,” Taneja said. 
“There was a lot of hype 
surrounding it and I got here 
a while back and I think it’s 
really 
stunning 
from 
the 
outside as well as from the 
inside. I’m excited to check 
it out and check all the other 
stories and everything this 
place has to offer.”
Susan Pile, senior director 
of University Unions and 
Auxiliary 
Services, 
was 
excited to see the Union 
reopen 
to 
students 
and 
emphasized in an interview 
with The Daily how grateful 
she felt to have been able to 
work on the project.
“This is the highlight of 
my 
professional 
career,” 
Pile 
said. 
“To 
be 
able 
to do this work at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
with these students, staff, 
administration 
and 
with 
this building is a once in a 
career opportunity. This is 
a campus community, this is 
a student space. To now have 
it for students and alive with 
students, this is it. This is 
what it’s all about.”

“It is kind of a bummer 
for the same reason that I’m 
a senior and the restaurants 
aren’t open,” Niforos said. “I 
only have a month or so to use 
that resource. I did have two 
years of it, but at the same 
time it would have been nice to 
have this semester which was 
initially promised.” 
Niforos was able to see 
the Union before its grand 
re-opening. She was under the 
impression the Union would be 
“gutted out,” but was happy to 
see many of the old structures 
still intact. 
“I got to (see) the remodel 

last week,” Niforos said. “I love 
that they kept the integrity of 
it and just added a few modern 
aspects.” 
Business freshman Gretchen 
Ascher, an employee at the 
Union Sweetwaters, worked on 
opening day. She said the first 
day went well despite how busy 
it was. 
“It was super busy, but it 
was really good,” Ascher said. 
“We had a line out the door 
all day today. Everyone that 
was there for the opening 
ceremony was so excited to 
see it open as well.”
When asked if students 
were upset about most of the 
restaurants not being open, 
Ascher said a few students she 
spoke to were unhappy. Even 
so, Ascher said most students 

were excited about the new 
Sweetwaters location. 
“A couple of students were 
upset,” Ascher said. “A lot of 
people were excited to get 
their coffee and get their 
drinks, they were just really 
excited that we were open.” 
As 
a 
freshman, 
this 
is 
Ascher’s 
first 
time 
experiencing 
the 
Union. 
She said she and her friends 
will try to visit the space 
frequently. 
“It’s been hyped up by all 
the upperclassmen,” Ascher 
said. “There are so many great 
study spaces there and when 
the restaurants all open, I’m 
sure those will be popular. I 
live in West Quad, so I plan on 
spending a ton of time at the 
Union and I know my friends 

do too. I hope I see a lot of 
familiar faces.”
Niforos is also excited for 
underclassmen to experience 
something 
she 
felt 
was 
so important early in her 
collegiate career. 
“I think about all of the 
freshmen 
and 
sophomores 
who 
never 
experienced 
it 
and never got that resource 
because it was so integral 
to my first two years here,” 
Niforos said. 
Though many restaurants 
are closed at the moment, 
Union businesses are looking 
for new student hires. Pile 
said Union directors and the 
businesses are looking forward 
to hiring. 
“We would love to have, and 
I know the vendors would love 

to have, student employees and 
for students to work in their 
operations,” Pile said. 
Pile emphasized the Union 
as a social hub and said she 
believes it contributes to the 
student climate. 
“Ultimately, the Union is 
about 
building 
connections 
and creating a strong sense of 
community,” Pile said. “That’s 
my hope for the space, that 
students will use it in a variety 
of ways. Whether that’s student 
org work or through meeting 
friends for social activities 
to planning programs in the 
building, to attending events, to 
just grabbing a bite to eat. That 
happens in lots of different ways 
and we’re excited the Union can 
offer all of those things to meet 
student needs.”

 ‘You folks should do all 
your messing around with 
the lake in the wintertime 
because that’s when I’m 
in 
Florida,’” 
Och 
said. 
“It gives you an idea of 
the information we are 
learning tonight and the 
general public’s idea of 
what’s going on.”
Guy Meadows, director 
of the Marine Engineering 
Laboratory at Michigan 
Technological University, 
discussed 
recent 
news 
about houses on Michigan 
shorelines being engulfed 
by the Great Lakes and 
the trends in precipitation 
and 
evaporation 
levels 
over the last 30 years. 
“The highs and the lows 
in the Great Lakes water 
levels indicate that we 
are seeing more extremes 
in both the upward and 
downward 
direction,” 
Meadows said. 
James 
Clift, 
deputy 
director at the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Environment, addressed 
the specific solutions the 
program is implementing. 
The 
solutions 
include 
infrastructure planning, 
reviewing 
shoreline 
protection permits and 
planning 
an 
upcoming 
High Water Summit to 
educate the community 
about rising water levels. 
LSA sophomore Janel 

LaPalm said the event 
reminded 
her 
of 
how 
important it is to keep in 
mind the impacts humans 
have on the environment. 
“Environmental 
issues are very complex 
in that we have to find 
ways as humans who 
want to interact with 
nature to adapt to the 
constant 
change 
of 
nature, especially climate 
change,” LaPalm said. 
Engineering 
sophomore Zuly Tahiz 
Pasillas-Riquelme 
said 
she thinks water levels 
in the Great Lakes are 
an 
issue 
of 
concern 
and something people 
should 
be 
educated 
about.
“One 
of 
the 
main 
takeaways 
was 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
climate 
change doesn’t typically 
hit 
the 
Midwest 
but 
the rising water level 
is a real problem for 
people living along the 
shoreline,” 
Pasillas-
Riquelme said.
Och 
concluded 
the 
evening by connecting 
the concerns with the 
Great 
Lakes 
to 
the 
larger, global issue of 
climate change. 
“I come across people 
who 
think 
climate 
change 
is 
going 
to 
happen 
to 
somebody 
else, far in the future and 
that it’s not a Midwest 
problem,” Och said. “And 
this might be a wake-up 
call.”

“Now, this is generally okay 
if the case of the situation is 
someone hasn’t been able to 
teach very well, maybe they 
haven’t been able to fulfill 
their teaching duties, but it 
looks particularly bad when 
maybe they are, say, a sexual 
predator.” 
As part of the Senate 
Assembly’s ongoing effort 
to 
better 
connect 
the 
University’s 
disparate 
schools 
and 
programs, 
Greg 
Laurence, 
associate 
professor of management at 
U-M Flint, highlighted U-M 
Flint’s successes in hosting 
Yo-Yo Ma and Dr. Jane 
Goodall. He also touched 
on concerns with falling 
enrollment 
due 
to 
rapid 

population decline in Flint 
and surrounding areas.
“We are experiencing now 
four years of enrollment 
decline,” 
Laurence 
said. 
“Some 
of 
that 
may 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
water 
crisis, and people around 
the state’s reaction to that. 
Systemically, 
however, 
if 
you look at demographics 
maps of the state, in a state 
of 
declining 
population, 
especially 
in 
the 
five 
counties that touch it, where 
75 percent of our students 
come from, the population 
of those parts of the state 
is decreasing faster than 
elsewhere in the state.” 
Faculty 
Co-Ombuds 
Robert M. Ortega, associate 
professor of social work, 
and 
Michele 
Hannoosh, 
associate 
professor 
of 
French, ended the meeting 

with a presentation on the 
purpose and structure of the 
University Ombuds.
Ortega 
and 
Hannoosh 
led the assembly through 
their website and reminded 
them that the Ombuds can 
be a first step in resolving 
problems related to a conflict 
between faculty or concerns 
about University policy.
 
Other 
grievances 
with the policy included 
inconsistency between the 
timelines for employees and 
students 
when 
reviewing 
the 
preliminary 
report 
of their case, nonspecific 
language within the report 
and 
employees’ 
inability 
to appeal to the Office of 
Institutional 
Equities. 
SACUA chair Joy Beatty 
voiced 
these 
concerns, 
wondering 
aloud 
if 

employees would be allowed 
the opportunity to challenge 
a suspension.
“What is the rationale for 
not providing an employee 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to 
challenge 
a 
suspension 
without pay?” Beatty said. 
“Why 
are 
the 
timelines 
shorter for employees than 
they are for students?”
Cheney-Lippold 
also 
spoke at the meeting to 
discuss 
the 
University’s 
response 
to 
his 
decision 
to rescind a study abroad 
recommendation 
letter in 
2018. Cheney-Lippold said he 
rescinded the letter because 
of his participation in an 
academic boycott of Israel 
organized 
by 
Palastenian 
activists. 
In 
response 
to 
the incident, the University 
moved to take away Cheney-
Lippold’s sabbatical, freeze 

his pay and threatened to 
potentially 
dismiss 
him. 
Cheney-Lippold 
asked 
to 
meet with SACUA to discuss 
faculty political freedom.
“The Dean’s office seemed 
to stop caring about faculty 
wellness at all,” Cheney-
Lippold said. “I believe my 
case raises specific concerns 
regarding faculty academic 
and political freedom.”
Senate Assembly Member, 
Sara 
Ahbel-Rappe, 
a 
professor in the classical 
studies department, pushed 
back 
against 
Cheney-
Lippold’s decision to decline 
to write the recommendation 
letter, 
referencing 
discrimination 
within 
American institutions. She 
said the fact that Cheney-
Lippold isn’t boycotting the 
United States is a double 
standard. 

“Black 
people 
are 
shot 
everyday 
because 
they’re 
Black. I find it surprising 
when you say that you won’t 
write a letter for anybody 
going to Israel, and you would 
write one for someone in 
America,” Ahbel-Rappe said.
The 
SACUA 
committee 
agreed that their original 
statement 
regarding 
the 
case was rushed and didn’t 
represent the true beliefs of 
SACUA members. Multiple 
committee 
members 

mentioned 
that 
Cheney-
Lippold’s case was worrying 
because it showed the relative 
powerlessness of the faculty 
senate. Instead of having 
a say in the proceedings, 
SACUA’s statement was used 
to bolster the position of the 
University administration.

Term limits won’t solve the problem

T

erm limits are a solution 
frequently championed 
by both the left and 
right as a way to 
bring 
new 
people 
into office who offer 
new 
solutions 
to 
old problems. Term 
limits are an idea 
with 
widespread 
support: 
Tom 
Steyer, one of the 
billionaires running 
for the Democratic 
nomination, 
voiced 
his support for term 
limits. As did President Trump. 
These candidates aren’t alone, 
but a lot of support does not 
always guarantee good policy.
A term limit already exists 
for the presidency, but they are 
a somewhat recent invention: 
The 
22nd 
Amendment, 
which codified two terms for 
the presidency, was passed 
during 
the 
Truman 
years 
as a response to Franklin D. 
Roosevelt’s unprecedented four 
terms. Before Roosevelt, most 
presidents had stepped down 
in a show of respect to George 
Washington who had served 
only two terms. Presidential 
term limits have also not 
always been widely accepted. 
For example, in the late 1980s, 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan 
declared his support for a 
repeal of the 22nd Amendment 
in an interview with British TV 
personality David Frost. 
Reagan’s 
argument 
was 
that people ought to have the 
right to “vote for someone as 
often as they want to,” and he 
was correct — representative 
government works best when 
people can have their choice 
of leaders. Term limits trample 
over this right and choice and 
in doing so create a worse, more 
incompetent governing class, 
thus damaging the experience 
for all members of society. 
Usually, one reason people 
champion term limits is to 
address 
corruption. 
First, 
proponents 
argue 
that 

politicians limited by terms 
will be less likely to need 
campaign 
cash 
(because 
they run for fewer 
terms). 
Another 
argument 
is 
that 
term limits might be 
a way to address the 
“revolving door,” a 
phenomenon where 
formerly 
elected 
officials 
transition 
to lobbyists. 
Unfortunately, 
both of these ideas 
are 
incorrect 
as 
term-limited politicians spend 
less 
time 
with 
constituent 
services than their non-term 
limited 
contemporaries, 
but 
spend an equal amount of time 
campaigning and fundraising. 
Fewer terms make constituent 
services less important. If a 
politician only faces voters a few 
times, the incentive for strong 
constituent services decreases. 
With regards to closing the 
revolving door, Michigan is an 
excellent example of that door 
being open. In 1992, Michigan 
voters checked the box next to 
the smooth-talking, slicked-
back saxophone player Bill 
Clinton and also voted in favor 
of term limits in the Michigan 
Term 
Limits 
Amendment, 
Proposal B. The limits were 
three two-year terms for the 
House of Representatives and 
two four-year terms for the 
Senate. A few years ago, the 
Detroit Free Press investigated 
the results of this bill and 
they were pretty depressing. 
Of the almost 300 officials 
elected from 1992 to 2014, 71 
of them — nearly 25 percent — 
registered as lobbyists or ended 
up working as consultants or 
paid advocates. Having a rate 
this high calls into question 
the efficacy of term limits and 
questions the continuation of 
the blind promotion of term 
limits in other states and at the 
federal level. 
The 
most 
significant 
issue 
with 
term 
limits 

comes with what is done to 
institutional knowledge. Only 
by maintaining a long career 
can a politician build the skill 
set necessary to achieve great 
things and overcome obstacles. 
Lyndon Johnson became the 
Master of the Senate by virtue 
of 
his 
longtime 
career 
in 
Congress, but if he had been 
kicked from the House after six 
years, that never would have 
been. Indeed, in states with 
term-limited politicians, the 
only people who stay and thus 
have more power are lobbyists 
and partisan staff. Partisan 
staffers 
have 
a 
politician’s 
ear over the more apolitical, 
legislative staffers due to the 
fact that politicians are more 
familiar with the campaign 
crew and more likely to look 
to them for advice. Elected 
officials 
don’t 
have 
time 
to build relationships with 
the apolitical staff, and the 
governing process is worse 
when those staff are cut out 
of 
the 
picture. 
Lobbyists 
also 
gain 
power 
because 
they pick up institutional 
knowledge 
by 
virtue 
of 
being the only people who 
survive the churn. As a result, 
representatives 
effectively 
end up dependent on them for 
certain information and will 
vote accordingly. 
Finally, 
we 
have 
term 
limits in a highly relevant 
manner 
already: 
our 
elections. If the voters can 
decide to end a politician’s 
term by voting against them, 
why then should they not be 
able to give them another 
term provided there is no 
criminality or lawbreaking? 
Term limits are a bad idea 
but a snappy soundbite. They 
drain institutional knowledge, 
empower lobbyists and do 
nothing to prevent corruption. 
These drawbacks ought to be 
enough to say no to term limits.

Apocalypse within the Anthropocene
M

y 
adoration 
of 
tapirs began fifteen 
years 
ago 
after 
studying them for a second 
grade research project. They’re 
odd pachyderms with miniature 
trunks, panda-like faces and pig-
like bodies that make them look 
like they belong more in a Dr. 
Seuss book than a real-life zoo. 
Few other animals match both 
the charm and uniqueness that 
tapirs embody. While seemingly 
plump and lazy animals, they 
are powerful swimmers that 
have to worry about anacondas 
as much as jaguars as they scour 
the rainforests for food. Adding 
to their troubles is the ever-
encroaching, overbearing hand 
of humanity. Logging operations 
have specifically pushed the 
Malayan Tapir, also known 
as the “Oreo” tapir for its coat 
pattern, to near extinction. 
As 
humans 
continue 
to 
expand their influence over 
the natural world and lead us 
into the sixth mass extinction, 
a future devoid of the world’s 
most intriguing animals, from 
tapirs to orangutans to cheetahs, 
seems 
likely. 
Scientists 
are 
debating whether the geologic 
age we live in should be renamed 
to the Anthropocene, or “the 
epoch of humans,” to reflect our 
vast, unquestionable power as a 
species. 
It is an honor not even 
afforded 
to 
the 
dinosaurs, 
with 
our 
history 
becoming 
inextricably 
linked 
to 
the 
planet’s on July 16, 1945, after 
the eruption of the first atomic 
bomb 
in 
Alamogordo, 
New 
Mexico. Radioactive materials 
settled onto the world’s rocks 
and thus into the geologic time 
frame, marking the beginning 
of humanity as a force of nature, 
with our impact as grand as any 
geologic or biological process 
on the planet. This power is 
something no other species has 
achieved and will be visible in 
the geologic record billions of 
years after Earth is far behind 
us. 
Perhaps the largest example 
of mankind’s godlike influence 
is climate change. Growing up 
in Nebraska, hurricanes and 
rising sea levels were hardly a 
concern of mine. The effects 
of climate change seemed too 
far removed from me — both 
geologically 
and 
temporally 
— to care all that much about. 
What I didn’t comprehend was 
the limitless myriad of effects 
a warming climate will have 
on the heartland of America as 
much as the coasts. Scientists 

continue to discover that climate 
change deals with the increase 
of ancient plagues as much as 
the rise of sea levels. 
On the frigid Siberian tundra 
of the Yamal Peninsula, the 
soil can be frozen solid as 
deep as 1,000 feet. Within this 
natural freezer lies the highly 
preserved corpses of incredible 
artifacts, from cave lions to 
wooly 
mammoths. 
Amongst 
these prehistoric creatures are 
millions of corpses of Santa’s 
pal, the reindeer, also known 
as caribou. These impressive 
animals can roam in massive 
herds far above the Arctic Circle 
where 
few 
people 
survive. 
Caribou are not only adorable 
but dangerous, as they are 
natural carriers of the bacteria 
anthrax. 

In the early 20th century, 
infectious 
bacterial 
diseases 
decimated millions of caribou 
throughout 
Siberia, 
causing 
their corpses to be preserved 
in the ever-frozen tundra. A 
record-breaking heatwave in 
2016 dethawed one of these 
diseased 
corpses 
and 
the 
sustained anthrax spores along 
with 
it. 
The 
hundred-year-
old “zombie” disease spread 
throughout a local herd before 
finding its way into the stomachs 
of local Nenet Siberians, who 
routinely consume the caribou. 
The bacterial disease spread 
rapidly, killing one child and 
forcing the Russian government to 
euthanize thousands of reindeer. 
Scientists worry that this is a 
prelude for what’s to come as the 
Arctic continues to heat up three 
times faster than the rest of the 
world — thawing the permafrost 
that contains millions of corpses, 
both animals and people. Human 
cemeteries, like the mass grave 
for Spanish Flu victims found in 
Alaska, may provide even more 
opportunities for ancient diseases 
to infect animals and people 
once again. While century-old 
epidemics may be one of the most 
bizarre effects of climate change, 
unfortunately, they are hardly the 
most concerning. 

Now 
entering 
its 
ninth 
year, the Syrian Civil War has 
shocked and split the world, 
particularly over the refugee 
crisis. While this is often seen 
as the international effect of the 
war, internal migration within 
Syria may have also been one 
of the triggers that began the 
conflict. From 2006 to 2009, 
the nation experienced its worst 
drought in 900 years. This, 
combined with disastrous water 
management, pushed 1.5 million 
people to flee as crops failed in 
the rural regions of the country, 
effectively 
furthering 
social 
strife. Scientists concluded that 
climate change likely caused, or 
at least worsened, the drought 
by changing weather patterns in 
the region.
The Syrian Civil War may 
be a foreshadowing for what 
much of the increasingly water-
scarce world may turn into in 
the near future. Massive cities 
like Cape Town have already 
run out of water in the past 
and other urban metropolises, 
from Melbourne to Mexico 
City, aren’t far behind as the 
Southern Hemisphere continues 
to heat up. More than 140 
million people may be forced to 
leave their homes due to climate 
change by 2050, according to the 
World Bank. With a changing 
climate being linked to human 
violence for the past 12,000 
years, “water wars” are likely 
to break out as people fight over 
increasingly unattainable and 
precious resources. 
From landing a man on 
the moon to creating a global 
society, 
climate 
change 
has 
far 
from 
outshone 
humanity’s successes in the 
Anthropocene. Even so, it’s 
posing an existential threat to 
the survival of human society 
— and so many other species — 
as we know it. As most nations 
fail to sufficiently respond 
to the warnings of climate 
professionals and scientists, it 
may be time to curb the talk of 
future sea level rises to the more 
immediate and eye-catching 
threats confronting humanity, 
ranging from ancient plagues 
to “water wars.” Continuing 
with the same old rhetoric 
and 
warnings 
that 
have 
failed to scare humans from 
changing their ways means 
continuing 
to 
waste 
the 
precious time needed to avoid 
the potentially apocalyptic 
future lurking on the horizon.

How is my English?

O

ne 
of 
my 
graduate 
student instructors last 
semester 
was 
Asian. 
Her English was not necessarily 
perfect, as she carried a little 
bit of an accent, but I never had 
trouble understanding what she 
was saying during discussions. 
Every now and then, she would 
get ahead of herself — as we all do 
— trying to answer questions. One 
day, from the back of the room, I 
heard someone say, “I have no idea 
what she’s saying.” I thought him 
speaking over her was disruptive, 
but decided not to bring it up at 
that moment and instead settled 
with giving him “a look.” The 
discussion ended some 20 minutes 
afterward, and as we were all 
getting ready to leave the room, I 
heard the same guy jokingly ask 
his friend if they should switch to 
a different section, where the GSI 
could speak better English.
I’m an international student 
from Korea who first came to the 
United States as a high school 
freshman. Trying to adjust to a 
completely 
new 
environment, 
I had one major concern: my 
English. 
I 
started 
learning 
English at the early age of five, 
thanks to my wise and perceptive 
parents. Somehow, I was able 
to speak the language without 
much accentuation, and as the 
years went by, I improved. At one 
point, I was asked by one of the 
teachers in my school, a native 
English speaker, if I was born in an 
English-speaking country. That 
felt good. For someone traveling 
all the way to the other side of the 
globe for the first time, by himself, 
as a 15-year-old, I was confident 
about my language skills and 
knew I wouldn’t have any problem 
communicating with the people I 
was going to meet. 
High 
school 
was 
great. 
Although it was one of the most 
stressful times in my life, it 
still remains one of my dearest 
memories. But there was one 
thing: I, who spoke almost 
perfect English, was accepted 
more as a friend and a student, 
when compared to my best friend 
who had a slight Korean accent. 
This dynamic made me think an 
American accent was an important 
distinction that made someone’s 
English more acceptable than 
another’s. I luckily never lost the 

confidence I carried with me to 
the U.S., a confidence I developed 
from the validation I felt by 
not having an accent. Speaking 
without an accent nearly became 
an innate quality of mine: I did not 
have to constantly remind myself 
that I was not a native speaker.
College is also great. By the 
time I got to Ann Arbor, I had 
already forgotten about the whole 
accent issue. And then I was 
unexpectedly reminded of the 
whole thing from that disruptive 
classmate.
Following that day, I was more 
self-conscious about my near-
perfect English. I had to think 
twice before I opened my mouth. 
I was afraid I might stumble 
through words or occasionally 
mess up the Ls and Rs, as they 
are sounds often fumbled by 
Koreans. I hesitated before saying 
the word “parallel.” An upcoming 
impromptu speech in my public 
speaking class suddenly felt like 
a nightmare. After spending a 
couple of days unnecessarily 
stressing myself out, I began to 
question the importance of an 
accent in speaking English. Is 
it really important or is it just 
another distinguishing factor that 
makes certain people sound better 
than others and nothing more? 
There was a brief experiment 
about the importance of an accent 
in English, conducted in Korea. 
Two groups of people, Koreans 
who only spoke limited English 
and native English speakers, 
listened to a speech delivered 
in English by Ban Ki-moon, the 
former Secretary-General of the 
United Nations. After the speech, 
both groups were asked to give 
remarks and assess the quality 
of the speech. Ban Ki-moon’s 
speech was targeted to a group of 
diplomats, so it was very eloquent 
and 
formal 
in 
manner 
and 
delivery, with an appropriate level 
of vocabulary used. The result of 
the study was interesting. Koreans 
who only spoke limited English 
generally thought the speech was 
a relatively poor one. Given Ban’s 
accent, they said it was hard for 
them to make out what he was 
saying. However, native English 
speakers responded by saying they 
did not have too much trouble 
understanding him and were 
very impressed by the quality 

of the speech in general. So, the 
experiment — at least to a certain 
degree — proved the accent is 
of minor concern in evaluating 
a speech. The experiment also 
proved that native speakers tend 
to focus more on the content, not 
the accent, as much as those who 
don’t speak the language.
The classmate who made those 
comments is an American and a 
native English speaker, I assume. 
What compelled him to make 
such comments? Of course, we 
must be wary when it comes to 
generalizations. In this case, I 
cannot assume that my classmate 
is like the native English speakers 
from the experiment who did not 
consider an accent to be of much 
importance. But the joke toward 
the end of the class made me think 
again. It made me reminisce about 
my high school experience and 
forced me to be conscious of my 
English for a while. What is clear, 
though, is that the comments 
made by my classmate were 
completely 
unnecessary. 
My 
classmate never switched to a 
different section after all. 
I don’t want to shed my 
classmate in a negative light per 
se. Nor am I writing this piece 
out of emotional reaction. The 
University is becoming more 
inclusive and diverse regarding 
students 
and 
faculty 
alike. 
There are a lot of international 
students like me, as well as 
professors and instructors from 
all around the world. Maybe 
some of them have such unique 
accents that they can’t go 
unnoticed. However, whether 
they have an accent shouldn’t be 
a central question or focal point. 
The question should always be 
how we can be considerate of 
one another and understand 
that we come from different 
backgrounds. 
As 
bright-
minded 
young 
adults, 
we 
should all work towards a 
more inclusive and welcoming 
environment. To do this, I 
politely ask that next time you 
see or talk to someone who 
has an accent, listen to what 
the person is saying, not to 
how the person sounds when 
they’re saying it.

Amid the revival of the 
movie musical, NBC’s new pilot 
“Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist” 
seeks to capture the camp of 
Broadway classics along with 
modern millennial cynicism. 
A slightly magical premise and 
some genuinely funny moments 
make this show stand out from 
more formulaic sitcoms.
Zoey 
(Jane 
Levy, 
“Don’t 
Breathe”), owner of the titular 
“Extraordinary Playlist,” works 
as a coder at a San Francisco 
start-up 
and 
struggles 
to 
connect with other people. 
After receiving an MRI during 
a small earthquake, she finds 
herself able to hear the inner 
thoughts of those around her 
in the form of pop songs and 
choreographed dances. With 
this ability, she discovers her 
male coworkers are targeting 
her for her gender, her crush 
Simon (John Clarence Stewart, 
“Luke Cage”) is coping with 
a death in the family and her 
near-comatose 
father 
(Peter 
Gallagher, “American Beauty”) 
is trying to reach out in his 
catatonic state.
At 
first 
confused 
and 
terrified 
by 
her 
musical 
semi-hallucinations, 
Zoey 
gradually 
comes 
to 
accept 
that her telepathy can work to 
her advantage. By the end of 
the pilot, Zoey has secured a 
promotion at her start-up and 
has helped repair her family 
relationships. 
Unfortunately, 
Zoey’s 
powers begin to reveal things 
that she did not want to know: 

Zoey’s love interest is actually 
engaged to another woman and 
her best friend and coworker 
Max 
(Skylar 
Astin, 
“Pitch 
Perfect”) is secretly in love 
with her. Employing the help 
of her eccentric neighbor Mo 
(Alex Newell, “Glee”) Zoey 
sets out to hone her newfound 
powers and avoid completely 
losing her mind to the music. 

“Zoey’s 
Extraordinary 
Playlist” has an undoubtedly 
ridiculous premise. It makes 
almost no sense. An MRI 
giving someone superpowers 
is too unrealistic for even the 
most absurd comic book. But 
it’s not a complete bust. At 
their best, musicals are campy 
and fun, so why not make TV 
the same way? After years of 
somber movie musicals like 
“Les Misérables” and box office 
disasters like “Cats,” there’s 
a distinct lack of truly joyous, 
respectably nonsensical music-

based media.
The 
musical 
numbers 
of 
“Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist” 
are entertaining, the humor is 
self-aware and the characters 
are original and compelling. 
Overall, the silliness of the 
musical magic is balanced out 
by the genuine fun of the guilty 
pleasure sitcom format. The 
pilot sets up multiple storylines, 
establishing quick pacing. It 
does a good job of keeping the 
mood up when working against 
the 
idyllic 
San 
Francisco 
scenery. Still, the main issue 
with the pilot is its attempt to 
force tragedy into the mix. 
By 
introducing 
Zoey’s 
father as having a debilitating 
neurological 
condition 
that 
renders 
him 
unresponsive 
to 
most 
stimuli, 
“Zoey’s 
Extraordinary 
Playlist” 
sets 
up 
tearjerker 
moments 
in 
his musical sequences that 
feel more exploitative than 
heartfelt. In equating Zoey’s 
quirky 
relationship 
drama 
with a family tragedy, the show 
doesn’t leave room to confront 
the more difficult themes of 
loss and grief that don’t mesh 
well with the pop soundtrack.
Whether 
“Zoey’s 
Extraordinary 
Playlist” 
can 
balance the wildly differing 
issues in the main character’s 
life with proper sensitivity 
remains to be seen. Regardless 
of this potential blindspot, the 
show had a promising start 
and has given itself ample 
room to grow and improve. 
If 
“Zoey’s 
Extraordinary 
Playlist” can identify its weaker 
components, this show could 
fully capture the best aspects of 
the musical genre in a creative 
and innovative way.

‘Extraordinary Playlist’ 
just might have the range

NBC

ANYA SOLLER
Daily Arts Writer

Selena Gomez has seen it 
all. Lupus, a kidney transplant, 
publicized battles with anxiety 
and depression, an on-again, 
off-again 
ex-boyfriend 
who, 
you know, just happens to be 
Justin Bieber. With her latest 
album, Rare, she puts it all out 
on the table.
“Oh, why don’t you recognize 
I’m so rare?” Gomez asks on the 
title track and album opener. 
This question and recognition 
of 
self-worth 
permeate 
through every song on Rare. 
Accompanied by soft, often 
midtempo, bubbly production 
and 
Gomez’s 
tendency 
to 
whisper and shout as much as 
she sings, this album crafts an 
atmosphere that feels prismatic. 
It’s pink and green and nice to 
float around in for an hour. It’s 
a celebration: both for Gomez’s 
hard-fought self love and for 
everyone else to realize their 
worth alongside her.
On 
“Ring,” 
Gomez 
plays 
the bored and adored subject 
of many admirers’ attention. 
“Wrapped ‘round my finger 
like a ring, ring, ring,” she 

sighs. The ring in the song later 
becomes the sound of the phone 
calls suitors keep making, but 
she doesn’t feel like bothering 
with. The production is playful, 
and it’s nice 
to see Gomez 
own 
her 
power 
after 
she’s claimed 
it for herself.
However, 
Gomez jumps 
back into self-
defense 
on 
the addictive 
track 
“Vulnerable.” 
She 
declares 
her openness 
to 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
love, 
considering 
that “the only 
other option’s 
letting 
go” 
of 
the 
relationship. 
Gomez 
interrogates 
her potential 
lover 
at 
a rapid pace before diving 
into the chorus. “If I give 
the opportunity to you then 
would you blow it? / If I was 

the greatest thing to happen 
to you would you know it?” 
she demands. Gomez makes 
the choice to fall for someone, 
feeling like they’re about to run 
away 
together 
on 
a 
secret 
mission. 
“People You 
Know” is simple 
and 
almost 
painfully 
repetitive, 
yet 
Gomez 
gets 
away with it. 
“We 
used 
to 
be 
close, 
but 
people can go / 
from people you 
know to people 
you don’t” she 
sings 
with 
indifference. 
The 
topic 
matter 
is 
so 
relatable 
that 
little else needs 
to be said for 
the 
message 
to resonate. It 
feels 
a 
little 
lazy to outline 
the arc of a 
relationship so succinctly, but 
it’s also fitting and upsettingly 
truthful. 
In “Cut You Off” the listener 

hears the end of the Bieber-
Gomez saga once and for all 
as if it’s going down in real 
time. “Gotta chop-chop all 
the extra weight / I’ve been 
carrying for fourteen-hundred-
sixty days,” she admits to the 
mirror. The way Gomez slinks 
into this gradual realization is 
pleasantly reminiscent of her 
friend and singer-songwriter 
Julia Michaels’ style. 
On the closing track, “A 
Sweeter Place,” Gomez yearns 
for an escape. The song ascends 
above the already gooey, clap 
track, bubblegum tone of the 
album’s creation into a more 
sugar-coated heaven. Kid Cudi’s 
feature feels a bit out of place 
in Gomez’s daydream, but not 
enough to distract from what 
she’s getting at. Lyrics like, “Is 
there a place where I can hide 

away? / Red lips, french kiss 
my worries all away,” show 
that despite all of her previous 
growth, she’s still 
growing. 
Perhaps 
the 
best 
evidence 
of this need for 
further 
growth 
is 
in 
Rare’s 
missteps. “Kinda 
Crazy” kicks off 
to an intriguing 
start 
with 
juicy, 
imagery-
filled lyrics, but 
falls flat into a 
clunky 
chorus. 
“Crowded Room” 
gives 
Gomez’s 
vocals space to 
breathe and even shine, but 
does little else despite a feature 
from 6lack. 

Rare is a building block 
for Gomez. It’s sticky sweet. 
Sometimes so much so that 
it 
can 
feel 
stuck in self-
empowerment, 
no matter how 
important that 
theme is. And 
yet, 
Rare 
is 
necessary 
to 
the arc of both 
Gomez’s career 
and 
personal 
journey. 
An 
artist 
equally 
gentle 
and 
empowering, 
a person who 
has endured a 
lot but remains 
well-intentioned, Selena Gomez 
is truly rare, and we should 
appreciate her for it.

And yet, Rare 
is necessary to 
the arc of both 
Gomex’s career 
and personal 
journey.

empowerment on ‘Rare’

INTERSCOPE RECORDS

Among coming-of-age stories, 
“Where the World Ends” by 
Geraldine McCaughrean is a 
bleak example. Nine boys and 
three men are stranded on what 
is essentially a large outcropping 
of rocks called the Warrior Stac, 
off the coast of their remote 
home in the British Isles. 
This part is true — there 
was a group of people stranded 
on a birding trip in the mid-
eighteenth century — but the 
history is more an inspiration 
for 
McCaughrean 
than 
a 
factual 
base. 
Quilliam, 
the 
fictional main character, is a 
young teenage boy who, at the 
outset of the novel, is excited to 
gather birds from the Stac. His 
excitement quickly sours as the 
group is mysteriously stranded 
with no boat from the mainland 
to come pick them up at the end 
of their journey. 
The 
premise 
is 
clearly 
depressing, and the plot makes 
it seem like the book would be 
a chore to consume, leaving 
the reader with a vague sense 
of existential doom. Strangely, 
even after brutal depictions of 
violence, 
death, 
banishment 
and hunger, an enduring hope 
prevails at the novel’s conclusion. 
The boys themselves, as well as 
the birds that they hunt and rely 
on for survival, are symbols of 
perseverance. 
McCaughrean 
circumvents 
the possible problem of a tiringly 
masculine book as Quill learns 
early on in their ordeal that one 
of the other boys, John, is not 
a boy at all. What follows is a 
conflicted handling of gender 
pronouns as Quill tries to keep 
John’s secret for her own safety, 
while 
still 
acknowledging 
the gender identification she 
revealed to him. Meanwhile, 
John herself struggles with a 
complicated identity. She was 
pretending to be a boy at the 
behest of her mother, because 
she had never borne the son 
her husband wanted, so John 
“had always felt guilty since 
birth, after all, for not being a 
boy.” She knows she does not 
want to change her name or her 
personality, however — when one 
of the boys says he could never 
marry a John, she replies, “You 
can and you shall! ... I canna be 
doing with a new name.” John’s 
identity adds a layer of gender 
politics to the new society that 

formed on the Stac. When the 
other boys try to exclude her 
from meetings on the basis of 
sex, she reminds them that she 
was included for many months 
when they thought she was a 
boy. Her very existence forces 
the boys to reconsider their 
traditional views of gender amid 
a survival situation. 
McCaughrean 
also 
deftly 
balances nature imagery and 
character 
description. 
She 
describes the Stac and its birds as 
beautiful, while still capturing 
the 
stark 
and 
unforgiving 
nature of the rocks on which the 
boys survive for nine months. 
In the beginning, when hope 

is abundant on the Stac, the 
imagery is softer and more 
colorful — “The sunsets were 
feathery and pink. The brief 
nights were spark-filled with 
stars.” By the end of the book, 
when the Stac is no longer just 
an exciting symbol of manhood 
but also a bleak reminder of 
mortality, 
the 
descriptions 
become much darker: Quill is 
“impaled on the tip of a giant 
claw and held up close to the sky 
for cloud-beasts to squint at.” 
McCaughrean’s writing style 
transparently 
follows 
Quill’s 
feelings 
throughout, 
which 
not only strengthens the plot, 
but also helps her prose serve 
the overall emotional purpose 
of the novel. Even at the most 
desperate times, Quill retains 
a sense of wonder at the beauty 
of the Stac and an appreciation 
for the birds on it that give him 
life. Alongside Quill’s changing 
perceptions of his situation, the 

novel’s descriptions of nature 
shift from an innocent portrait 
of beauty to a more nuanced 
acknowledgement of the danger 
and brutality that comes with 
that beauty. 
Several parts of the boys’ 
experience on the Stac makes it 
bearable. Quill almost obsesses 
over a girl named Murdina 
whom he met briefly on his 
home island. She came to his 
island from the mainland to 
teach the boys more about 
reading and writing, which is 
part of the reason why Quill felt 
so connected to her — to him, 
she represented education and 
storytelling. Quill is deemed 
“Keeper of Stories” because 
of his penchant for creating 
fantastical tales about the world 
around him that keep the other 
boys optimistic. Even on the 
Stac, the most desolate of places, 
he takes comfort in “collect[ing] 
words.” When Cane’s Bible is 
torn apart and the pieces go 
flying into the wind, Quill turns 
his literary eye on the situation 
and says the pages are “seeding 
the ledges and crags with words” 
that could give the boys “signs, 
warnings, 
encouragement.” 
In the darkest hours on the 
Stac, when everything seems 
hopeless, Quill’s eternal faith in 
the power of words is heartening 
to the other boys and to the 
reader. 
Quill’s 
storytelling 
streak 
gets him in trouble sometimes, 
like when it comes to one of the 
adults stranded with the boys, 
Col Cane. Cane represents the 
oppressive force of religion gone 
wrong, as he appoints himself 
minister of the group despite 
having no authority to do so. 
When Quill tells a story Cane 
thinks is too “pagan,” Cane 
accuses him of being a witch 
and he is banished, though not 
before being literally stoned by 
the other boys at the direction 
of the “minister.” Gradually, the 
boys begin to disregard Cane, 
and by extension adults and 
organized religion, in favor of 
their own freedom and ideas. 
Despite the despair of being 
separated from everything they 
know, the boys experience a 
remarkable degree of freedom 
on the Stac away from structured 
authority and society. This is 
perhaps the most important part 
of their coming-of-age story — 
they have an unprecedented 
amount of freedom that allows 
them to find themselves. On a 
lonely rock outcropping, “every 
boy is some manner of a king.”

“Mingi 
wants you 
to know he 
hates 
tomatoes. 
He likes 
kevin.”

A number of movies could 
have 
quote-along 
showings 
with packed theaters full of 
diehard fans following along to 
every line of the film. But, from 
my experience, most of those 
aforementioned movies are part 
of some epic saga or franchise 
that has a hardcore fanbase — 
“The Avengers,” “Star Wars” 
and other major franchises. 
Which is great, of course 
(full disclosure: I am one of 
the diehard fans that could 
quote 
every 
line 
of 
“The 
Avengers”). But there are few 
movies outside of this category 
that can fill theaters with fans 
eager to relive the film with the 
characters. One of those rare 
movies is without a doubt Rob 
Reiner’s (“When Harry Met 
Sally”) “The Princess Bride.”
I went to the Michigan 
Theater’s 
“Princess 
Bride” 
quote-along, 
not 
really 
knowing 
what 
to 
expect. 
Maybe a few people shouting 
out “inconceivables” or “as you 
wishes” and the occasional “my 
name is Inigo Montoya.” That’s 
not what I got.
I got a packed theater, full 
of people who hadn’t just seen 

“The 
Princess 
Bride” 
once 
or twice before, but people 
who had the movie almost 
entirely 
memorized. 
People 
were 
following 
along 
with 

the characters’ lines, making 
jokes to one another from 
opposite ends of the theater and 
absorbing this movie that is so 

undeniably loved.
The 
thing 
about 
“The 
Princess Bride” is that it is an 
entirely new level of ridiculous. 
A prince named Humperdink 
(Chris 
Sarandon, 
“Fright 
Night”), a bizarrely gentlemanly 
sword fight, the notion of being 
“mostly dead”? None of these 
things strike anyone as being 
normal by any means, and in 
most other cases, details like 
these would be out of place. But 
in this movie, they’re perfect. 
This movie is unlike any other 
because the crazy, unbelievable 
moments 
complement 
the 
heartwarming scenes so well. 
To put it simply, for every 
scene where Buttercup (Robin 
Wright, 
“Forrest 
Gump”) 
literally flings herself down 
a hill in pursuit of Westley 
(Cary Elwes, “Saw”) — which 
is without a doubt one of the 
funniest (and most quotable) 
scenes in the movie — there is 
another scene where Westley 
jumps into quicksand without 
hesitation to save her. Every 
laughable moment has a lovable 
moment to match it.
The audience at the quote-
along knew that. They knew to 
laugh when Vizzini (Wallace 
Shawn, 
“Toy 
Story”) 
“out-
thought” Westley, they knew 
to boo the moment Prince 
Humperdink 
appeared 
on 

screen and they knew to cheer 
when Inigo (Mandy Patinkin, 
“Wonder”) finally avenged his 
father. They didn’t just quote 
the 
scenes; 
they 
matched 
Vizzini’s every lisp, Fezzik’s 
(André the Giant, “The Six 
Million Dollar Man”) gruff but 
sweet tone and the lilt of Inigo’s 
Spanish accent. They didn’t 
just know the movie; they were 
acting it out just as well as the 
characters were.
The bizarre and completely 
unrealistic moments in “The 
Princess Bride” would annoy 
movie watchers for just about 
any other film, but not this one. 
Those details are what make the 
movie what it is: an absolutely 
iconic film that nearly the whole 
world has seen. This isn’t the 
kind of film you can just walk 
away from and forget. You 
remember it. Not just the “as 
you wishes,” but the whole 
beautifully constructed story. 
And because it has become 
one 
of 
those 
movies 
that 
everyone has seen and loved, 
it can have a quote-along that 
is enormously successful. “The 
Princess Bride” draws in people 
who have seen it before but are 

willing to see it again because 
they just love it that much. Not 
many other films can do that. 
This one is special.

FILM NOTEBOOK
FILM NOTEBOOK

20TH CENTURY FOX

One question has plagued 
seniors at this university for 
decades: “What are you doing 
after graduation?” As I begin 
the last semester of my college 
career in the Film, Television 
and Media program, I can’t stop 
hearing this inane question. 
Everywhere you go, everyone 
you speak to, every barista, 
every aunt and uncle, every 
student from your first year 
writing class, every Tinder 
swipe, every single person 
on this dying planet wants to 
know what you — yes, you — 
are doing after graduation. No 
matter how many times they 
ask, they will ask again. They 
will all ask until the question 
mark at the end wraps around 
your neck like a condescending 
scarf, or rather, noose.
They 
wonder 
how 
your 
liberal arts degree will help 
you get a job. They ask why 
your 
parents 
paid 
tuition 
for you to watch movies. 
They don’t understand why 
you did not choose to study 
something more established 
or employable, like computer 
science or economics. They 
can’t wrap their heads around 
comedy as a profession, but 
they’ll ask: Have you seen “The 
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”? Did 
you know that Joe Something-
stein 
interned 
at 
Saturday 
Night Live 20 years ago? He 
works in insurance now, he 
can put you in touch. Their 
college 
roommate’s 
son’s 
college 
roommate’s 
sister’s 
ex-boyfriend’s 
uncle 
works 
in entertainment, or was is 
marketing?
Everyone wants to help you 
but they have no idea how. 
They want to give you a name, 
a number, a weak connection of 
any kind to prove something, 

perhaps to you but also to 
themselves. They want to be 
the ones who got you the job, 
so you won’t forget them when 
their kid needs a job. I’ll scratch 
your back if you scratch mine, 
or I’ll pass your shitty excuse 
for a resume to some assistant 
at Warner Bros. who my sister 
knows from BBYO so you don’t 
forget where you came from.
They inquire about your 
employable skills. You are more 
than proficient in Microsoft 
Office, but so is everyone. You 
spent years learning a language 
that no one speaks anymore. 
You 
used 
Photoshop 
once: 
naturally, you are an expert 
now. You have strong verbal 
and written communication 
skills, whatever the fuck that 
means. You can multitask, like 
that time you wrote an essay on 
Chaucer while simultaneously 
binge-ing “Love Island.” You 
are organized, but your room 
doesn’t highlight that (you are 
just super busy right now, if 
you were less busy, you would 
be way more organized). You 
are a team-player, as in you 
played on a little league team 
as an adult and you were still 
a benchwarmer. You are a 
problem-solver, 
you 
solve 
sudokus every day, even the 
medium level ones. You take 
initiative, you requested to 
follow him on Instagram before 
he requested to follow you. You 
have a positive attitude, you 
only cried twice this morning. 
You are a quick learner, you 
learned to use a tampon in 
the five minutes before Talia 
Shapiro’s pool party.
They 
cross-examine 
you, 
asking 
about 
entry-level 
assistant 
positions, 
you 
can surely get one of those, 
right? Well, assistants need 
assistance only if you’ve had 
assistance in previously being 
an assistant. So, no.
So, what are you doing after 
graduation?

How will you use 
that degree?

Parris plays hero against Spartans

Sean Bormet saw the look on 
Mason Parris’ face and knew 
what was going to happen.
The 
Michigan 
wrestling 
team may have lost its last four 
bouts. It may have nearly blown 
a 16-point lead to Michigan 
State. But the Wolverines knew 
that in the moment, none of 
that mattered, because they 
had a cheat code the Spartans 
didn’t: sophomore heavyweight 
Mason Parris.
The 
look 
Bormet 
saw 
didn’t betray him. Parris got 
a takedown right off the bat. 
After 29 seconds he had his 
opponent pinned, a result that 
gave the Wolverines six points 
and sealed their 22-14 win 
over Michigan State on Friday 
night.
“I was pretty confident that 
Mason was capable of pinning 
him,” Bormet, the Michigan 
coach, said. “I didn’t know 
exactly how fast he would get 
there. But the minute he got 
the takedown and got those 
arm bars, I could see the look 
on his face and he was gonna 
turn the guy and pin him.”
This is par for the course for 
Parris, who is the third-ranked 
heavyweight in the country 
and has five pins in seven 
matches. But it’s less often he 
has a performance as vital as 
Friday’s.
Coming off a loss to Oregon 
State 
and 
two 
lackluster 
invitational 
finishes, 
the 
25th-ranked Wolverines knew 
the 
opportunity 
they 
had 
kicking off the Big Ten season 
against the unranked Spartans. 
The start of the match reflected 
that, with Michigan taking the 
first five bouts and building a 
16-0 lead.
But Michigan State mounted 
a comeback, taking the next 
four 
bouts 
— 
including 
a 
technical fall that sent the 
Spartans’ side of the arena into 
a frenzy. With only one bout 

remaining, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
lead had shrunk to two.
Many other heavyweights 
would’ve crumbled in that 
situation. But Parris embraced 
the pressure, stepped on the 
mat and did the deed.
“I just saw their whole 
bench, Michigan State’s bench 
just getting off and getting 
really rowdy and everything 
and I mean, props to them, but 
I kinda knew what was coming 
up 
next 
with 
Mason Parris,” 
freshman 
Cole 
Mattin 
said. 
“Whenever 
that guy steps 
on the mat, you 
know 
there’s 
definitely 
a 
probability 
of getting six 
points on the 
board for us and 
I knew that was coming, no 
matter what.”
There’s 
no 
one 
else 
Michigan would rather have 
in a close match, and there’s 
no 
environment 
in 
which 
Parris thrives more. From the 
moment Parris stepped on the 
mat, Bormet was excited — 
not just for his star wrestler, 
but for the Cliff Keen crowd, 
because he knew it was about 
to be on its feet cheering.
Parris 
approaches 
every 
match the same, he says, but he 

loves being the heavyweight, 
because it means his bout is 
always last. There’s always a 
possibility the match comes 
down to him.
“It’s a lot of good pressure 
on me and it helps me wrestle 
better,” Parris said. “ … I 
just kinda wanted to get the 
crowd pumped up and put an 
exclamation point on the dual 
win.”
So when Parris held his 
opponent’s 
shoulders to the 
mat after just 
29 seconds, he 
lifted his arms 
up in response, 
getting 
the 
crowd loud as 
the fight song 
rang over the 
speakers. 
He 
flexed for the 
fans. He wanted 
an exclamation point, and boy, 
did he create one.
The Wolverines all saw it 
coming. But they enjoyed it just 
as much.
“I knew, especially who it 
was coming up next, Mason 
Parris, I kinda knew they didn’t 
really have a chance,” Mattin 
said. “I’m just being honest.
“Mason’s 
obviously 
very, 
very good. He’s super talented, 
he’s great at what he does, and 
he just went out and showed 
it.”

Wolverines reinvigorate rivalry

Whether Indiana wants to 
admit it or not, it has a rival in 
Michigan.
Since the 2015-2016 season, 
the Michigan men’s swimming 
and diving team has traded 
first and second place finishes 
with the Hoosiers at the Big 
Ten Championships. Of the 17 
swimmers and divers named to 
the 2019 All-Big Ten First Team, 15 
came from the two programs. 
“I really like our rivalry with 
them, if they consider it a rivalry 
with us,” senior Tommy Cope said.
One may attribute Indiana’s 
recent dominance over Michigan 
to Cope’s comment. 
The Hoosiers have notched back-
to-back Big Ten championships 
and third-place finishes at the 
NCAA Championships in the past 
two seasons. Back in November, 
Indiana handed the Wolverines 
their first loss of the season at a 
dual meet in Bloomington.
However, on Saturday, No. 
3 Michigan (4-1 overall, 2-1 Big 
Ten) redeemed itself by upending 
the fifth-ranked Hoosiers’ (6-3, 
2-1) recent reign of dominance 
and giving them their first Big 
Ten dual-meet loss in four years, 
resolidifying the rivalry. 
“It’s really fun to go race 

against top-notch people,” Cope 
said.“That’s how I know if I am 
doing well in the sport or not. It’s 
good to race against similar people. 
Iron sharpens iron.”
Saturday’s meet in Ann Arbor 
emulated the two schools’ tense, 
back-and-forth competition that 
has persisted over the years. In a 
meet where every dive and every 
race seemed to matter, both sides 
battled and exchanged first place 
finishes throughout the day. 
Impressive 
individual 
performances by Cope and junior 
Ricardo Vargas led the way for the 
Wolverines. 
Cope took first place in both 
the 100 and 200-yard breastroke 
(1:56.34, 
1:58.97), 
with 
senior 
Charlie Swanson and sophomore 
Will Chan finishing behind him 
in respective events. A crucial first 
place finish by Cope in the 200-
yard individual medley (1:45.61) 
helped Michigan pull away in the 
latter half of the meet. 
Capturing the sentiment of 
the rivalry, Cope splashed the 
water around and pumped his 
fist following his victory in the 
individual 
medley 
to 
mimic 
Indiana swimmers’ ostentatious 
celebrations in previous races.
Vargas, meanwhile, placed first 
in the 500 and 1,000-yard freestyle 
with times of 4:21.85 and 9:01.82, 
with sophomore Patrick Callan 

and senior Felix Auböck placing 
second and third behind Vargas in 
the 500.
Even when Indiana took first 
place in events, Michigan found 
ways to garner points in close races 
to secure second, third and fourth 
places. 
In the 200-yard butterfly, senior 
Miles Smachlo and Vargas finished 
second and third behind the 
Hoosiers’ Brendan Burns to pick up 
seven points for their side. Smachlo 
avenged himself to edge out Burns 
in the 100-yard butterfly with an 
impressive finish of 46.84.
In the diving well, although 
Indiana’s Mory Gould finished first 
place in the 1-meter and 3-meter 
events, junior Ross Todd, senior 
Jake Herremans and junior Chris 
Canning placed behind him in both 
events. The trio netted 18 points to 
cancel out the 18 points Gould won 
for his team.
“Everyone was up and scoring,” 
Michigan coach Mike Bottom said. 
“When (Indiana) won an event, we 
were right behind them with two 
or three people. We took away their 
superstars with our team. And 
that’s how you win these meets.”
Building off mounting mid-
season momentum, the Wolverines 
were able to rise to the challenge 
and prove why they have been 
right behind the Hoosiers in Big 
Ten rankings recently. 

Off the blocks

The pistol fired, sending 
the runners into motion at the 
Wolverine 
Invitational 
and 
signaling the beginning of the 
indoor track and field season 
for both the Michigan men’s 
and women’s teams. 
Out of 30 final events on 
Saturday, the Wolverines had 
25 individuals land podium 
finishes in 18 events — six of 
which were first place. The 
unscored invitational featured 
Eastern 
Michigan, 
Toledo, 
Buffalo, 
Miami 
(Fla.) 
and 
professional 
non-collegiate 
athletes. Among them were 
notable 
runners 
Melissa 
Bishop-Nriagu — a Canadian 
Olympian who ran at the 2012 
and 2016 Olympics — British 
Olympian Tiffany Porter and 
Olympic 
hopefuls 
Mason 
Ferlic and Shannon Osika, both 
former Wolverines.
“So we invite those kids in, 
those young men and women in, 
when we’re not having a scored 
meet,” Michigan co-head coach 
James Henry said. “We want 
our kids to aspire that, ‘I want 
to be there’ and, ‘I’m right next 
to an Olympian,’ and they’re 
out there in the meet and they 
see this is what it’s like. . . . So 
we want them here so they can 
aspire to be a part of that.”
But Michigan 
didn’t 
need 
to look far for 
inspiration. 
Both 
senior 
thrower Briana 
Nelson 
and 
junior 
thrower 
Courtney 
Jacobsen broke 
the 
previous 
school record of 
19.53 meters in 
the weight throw. 
Additionally, 
multiple 
athletes 
recorded 
personal 
records, including high jumpers 
Jada 
Wimberly 
and 
Katt 
Miner — a junior and a senior, 
respectively.
“Me and Jada wanted to 

be really relaxed today and 
not stressed about anything,” 
Miner said. “Our goal was just 
to make bar and just try to be 
consistent. And it just went way 
better than we both expected. 
But I think that’s just because 
we 
weren’t 
stressed 
about 
height or anything at all today.”
Wimberly placed third by 
jumping over a 1.70-meter bar, 
besting her previous indoor 
record of 1.66 meters. Miner 
shattered her 1.71 indoor record 
by clearing a 1.80-meter bar and 
claimed first in the high jump 
event. 
“I think other 
meets, we put 
pressure 
on 
ourselves 
to 
make 
certain 
bars,” 
Miner 
said. “We end 
up just kind of 
getting 
really 
tense and not 
fluid 
through 
it, 
so 
moving 
through them was really nice. 
And then, when we got to higher 
heights, we were just kind of 
like ‘OK, let’s keep it going.’ ”
Other first place finishers 
included 
sophomore 
Eric 
Harris in men’s pole vault, 
freshman Amanda Schaare in 

women’s shot put, sophomore 
John Meyer in men’s shot put, 
sophomore Colton Yesney in 
the men’s 3,000-meter run and 
both the men’s and women’s 
teams in the 4x400-meter relay. 
Additionally, 
freshman 
distance 
runner 
Ericka 
VanderLende placed seconf in 
the mile, only behind Nike-
sponsored runner and Tokyo 
2020 Olympic hopeful Shannon 
Osika. After a successful cross 
country season, VanderLende 
chose to work on her get-off 
and focused more on speed 
work during the 
winter. Despite 
the 
change 
going into her 
first 
indoor 
season, she still 
managed 
to 
finish favorably 
in her event.
At the end 
of 
the 
meet, 
Henry gathered 
both 
teams 
together and had the athletes 
share not only their successes, 
but their disappointments and 
failures as well.
“I want the kids to hear 
all levels of how well we’re 
doing so you can take that and 
become better,” Henry said. 

“So if someone wet the bed, use 
that to get better. If someone 
had an average day, use that to 
get better. If the throwers or 
whatever had a great day, use 
that to step up.
“So all action is a positive 
reaction.”
The goal is to get better. 
That’s why Henry has been 
having his athletes practice this 
self-reflection for over 30 years 
and why he’ll have them do it 
after every meet this year.
“It’s a process for all of 
our kids,” Henry said. “If you 

do well, it’s a 
process. If you 
do 
bad, 
it’s 
a 
process.”
The 
results 
of the Michigan 
men’s 
and 
women’s 
track 
and field teams’ 
first meet make 
one thing clear — 
each 
Wolverine 
is in a different 
part of the process. Some broke 
school and personal records. 
Some ‘wet the bed.’ And some 
didn’t even make it to the 
starting block on Saturday.
But one part of the process is 
clear — they are all expected to 
get better.

Every meet is a part of the 
process. From a non-scoring 
meet in early January to the 
NCAA Championships, there 
is value in every competition. 
Saturday, on an otherwise 
uneventful day, that value 
came from young athletes 
making their indoor debut 
for the Michigan men’s and 
women’s track team.
“The 
biggest 
thing 
I’m 
always looking for is that the 
kids get some competition 
in,” Michigan co-head coach 
James Henry said. “They get 
to the line, they finish the line 
and they’re healthy.”
A 
lot 
of 
freshmen 
did, 
in fact, get to the line and 
finish. In the 800-meter run, 
freshman Ben Jacobs sprinted 
to a fourth-place finish in 1:58. 
In the men’s mile, freshman 
Anthony DeKraker powered 
down 
the 
home 
straight 
coming in third with a time 
of 4:12, with freshman John 
Florence right behind him 
in fifth with a time of 4:17. 
Later in the meet, freshman 
Nick Trevisan came in third 
in the 3000-meter with a time 
of 8:43, surpassing several 
competitors who had taken an 
early lead over the pack.
A 
solid 
showing 
from 
the 
men’s 
newcomers 
was duplicated 
on 
the 
women’s side.
Freshman 
Samantha 
Saenz 
took 
fourth in the 
3000-meter, 
covering the 15 
laps in 10:02. 
And freshman 
Ericka VanderLende — coming 
off her All-American cross 
country season — took second 
place in the women’s mile with 
a mark of 4:49, losing only to 
Nike’s 
professional 
runner 
Shannon Osika.
“In high school, I didn’t 

really do a lot of hard stuff 
in the winter, and now I’m 
doing a lot of hard workouts,” 
VanderLende 
said 
of 
her 
transition to her first track 
season. “So I’m seeing a lot 
of big improvements for the 
indoor season.”
VanderLende’s second place 
finish was only surpassed by 
one Michigan newcomer — 
freshman Amanda Schaare. 
Schaare won the women’s 
shot put with a throw of 15.22, 
besting the rest of the field by 
over two-tenths of a meter. 
“She redshirted last year. 
She wasn’t ready for the big 
leagues,” Henry said. “But she 
was trained to be a big leaguer, 
and she stepped onto the stage 
and she performed like a big 
leaguer. That’s just a part of 
the process.”
Henry stressed the process 
for 
these 
young 
athletes. 
For him, it’s all about the 
Wolverines coming in and just 
getting better and committing 
to it, and all of these young 
competitors 
seem 
to 
be 
responding.
“It’s a process for all of our 
kids, 
especially 
(Michigan 
co-head coach Jerry Clayton)’s 
kids, it’s important,” Henry 
said. “If you do well, it’s a 
process. If you do bad, it’s a 
process.”
Schaare 
is 
a 
shining 
example of this, 
with her year-
long break from 
competition 
allowing 
her 
to be a force in 
the field events 
like she was on 
Saturday.
“That 
kid 
spent the whole 
year training and 
not competing,” 
Henry said. “And when it’s her 
time to get on the stage, she 
shined.”
So, if the athletes who suited 
up for their debut Saturday 
trust the process as Schaare 
has, then there’s no telling just 
how bright the future can be.

Assessing the state of Michigan’s frontcourt

After 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team lost to Minnesota 
on Sunday, Juwan Howard fielded 
the same questions that surfaced 
after Thursday’s double-overtime 
win over Purdue.
On each occasion, the questions 
were rooted in the consistent 
success opposing Big Ten post 
players have sustained against the 
Wolverines’ interior defense. This 
time, though, the press conference 
took on a much different tone.
Reclining 
at 
the 
Crisler 
Center podium after Michigan’s 
victory over the Boilermakers, 
Howard was repeatedly asked 
about Purdue forward Trevion 
Williams’ 36 points and 20 
rebounds. He attributed it to his 
stubbornness, even flashing a grin 
at one point. 
But 
after 
Gophers’ 
center 
Daniel Oturu’s 30 points propelled 
Minnesota past the Wolverines 
on Sunday, there was no writing 
it off. And there was certainly no 
grinning.
For Michigan’s frontcourt, this 
isn’t a new problem. If anything, 
it’s becoming run of the mill. 
Oturu became the third Big 

Ten center to set a new career-
high scoring total against the 
Wolverines this season, joining 
Williams and Iowa’s Luka Garza.
At the core of Michigan’s 
problem is Howard’s refusal to 
double-team 
opposing 
centers 
in the low post — a strategy that 
leaves senior center Jon Teske 
with no help defense. 
“The coaching (is) stubborn, 
not bringing a double-team,” 
Howard said on Thursday. “I 
know Jon is like, ‘Well, can I get 
some help, too?’ … But at the end 
of the day, (Williams’) 36 points, 
those were on me — they weren’t 
on Jon Teske. He scored those on 
me.”
Entering this season, it seemed 
as though Michigan’s frontcourt 
had the potential to be its strong 
suit. Given Howard’s reputation 
for developing big men, it seemed 
safe to predict Teske would build 
off a productive junior season and 
sophomores Colin Castleton and 
Brandon Johns Jr. would take the 
next step.
As a unit, that hasn’t happened 
on the defensive end. Opposing 
Big Ten post players — Williams, 
Oturu, Garza, Michigan State’s 
Xavier 
Tillman 
and 
Illinois’ 
Kofi Cockburn — are averaging 

a staggering 29.8 points on 55 
percent shooting against the 
Wolverines.
Yet 
from 
an 
individual 
standpoint, Teske and Johns 
have taken a step forward under 
Howard’s tutelage. Teske’s 14.3 
points and 7.9 rebounds per 
game both lead the team, while 
his expanded post repertoire has 
allowed him to become a reliable 
source of offense. In Johns’ 
moments of clear confidence, 
he’s shown flashes of high-level 
play 
against 
the 
Hawkeyes, 
Spartans 
and 
Oregon. 
And 
despite Howard’s best efforts, 
Johns’ biggest pitfall remains his 
fluctuating confidence.
With 
Castleton 
averaging 
just 2.0 points on 21 percent 
shooting over the last six games, 
an opportunity has presented 
itself for senior center Austin 
Davis — who began the season 
as an afterthought — to crack 
the rotation. In the same span, 
Davis is averaging 5.8 points 
on a 65-percent clip. But Davis’ 
drawback remains his shaky 
defense, which underscores the 
team’s overall problem guarding 
the interior.
The power forward position, 
too, has been uncertain since 

junior Isaiah Livers sustained a 
groin injury on Dec. 21 and was 
ruled out indefinitely. This has 
caused Howard to tinker with 
a small-ball lineup featuring 
freshman wing Franz Wagner at 
the ‘4.’
With Livers on the shelf, 
Michigan has badly missed a 
vital piece of its offense. His 
conference-best 50-percent clip 
from beyond the arc preserves the 
necessary spacing for a formidable 
pick-and-roll. With Livers on 
the floor, defenses can’t afford to 
help off the perimeter when the 
ball-handler turns the corner, 
which is a major reason why the 
Wolverines are so successful out 
of the pick-and-roll.
Michigan has shot below 40 
percent from beyond the arc in all 
four games since Livers’ injury. 
When Howard was asked about 
Livers’ return date on Sunday, 
he dodged the question. For now, 
replacing him with Wagner — 
who can defend multiple positions 
and score at each level — attempts 
to combat that problem without 
overhauling the team’s offensive 
identity.
“That group is very dynamic,” 
Howard said. “They have five skill 
guys. Franz is a very skillful guy 
that can put the ball on the floor 
and shoot with good length.”
Against 
Purdue, 
Howard 
turned to that lineup for the final 
nine minutes of regulation and the 
entirety of both overtime periods. 
Three days later, it was on the 
floor for crunch time minutes in 
Minneapolis.
While Wagner (34.5 percent) 
poses more of a 3-point shooting 
threat than Johns (27.3 percent), 
neither open driving lanes by 
occupying off-ball defenders as 
well as Livers. As a result, off-ball 
defenders can leave them to help 
stop the pick-and-roll.
Perhaps Livers’ return will 
alleviate some of the spacing 
issues 
facing 
Michigan’s 
frontcourt. Until then, it remains 
uncertain whether Howard will 
be grinning at the podium going 
forward.

‘M’ unable to lock in

Lock-in.
It’s the motto the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team (1-0) 
adopted at the start of its season. 
Featured as a hashtag in each 
tweet from the team’s Twitter, 
and evident in every interview, 
the motto has come to define what 
the Wolverines strive to achieve 
each meet. However, in its season 
opener against Texas Woman’s 
University (0-1) and Washington 
(0-1), Michigan couldn’t convert 
its words into actions despite 
winning 195.650 to 195.350 to 
189.850, respectively.
The Wolverines looked locked-
in at the get-go. They started 
strong on the vault, posting a 
49.325 score. In her collegiate 
debut, freshman Gabby Wilson 
stuck the landing, earning a 
9.900 score — the highest on the 
night. Freshman Sierra Brooks 
and 
sophomore 
Maddie Mariani 
both contributed 
scores of 9.875.
“We came up 
with 
this 
new 
motto 
called 
lock-in,” Wilson 
said. “And I really 
tried to embody 
it.”
The 
next 
rotation featured 
Michigan on bars. Senior Maggie 
O’Hara tied her career-best with 
a score of 9.825 — after a season-
ending Achilles injury last season. 
Wilson won the bars event with a 
score of 9.875, while sophomore 
Natalie Wojick contributed a 
9.825. The Wolverines were 
cruising.
Then they fell apart.
Brooks fell off the bars during 
her transition from high to low 
bar, resulting in a 9.100. And with 
the move to beam, Michigan 
disregarded their new motto 
completely.
Wojick, 
the 
2019 
NCAA 
beam champion, fell early in her 

routine. Overall, the team scored 
just 48.100 points, nearly one full 
point lower than its scores on 
all the other events. The lack of 
execution on staying locked-in to 
routines caused the Wolverines to 
fall behind in the meet standings.
Going into the final rotation 
Michigan was losing to the 
Huskies by four-tenths of a point. 
Undeterred by the deficit, the 
Wolverines attacked the floor 
with newly-found focus — but 
continued to fall short. Wilson 
stepped out of bounds during 
a pass, and other errors were 
contributed by her teammates. 
The only gymnast to rise up from 
the adversity was Wojick, who 
rebounded from her error-ridden 
beam routine to post a score of 
9.900, winning the event.
In the face of numerous 
mistakes, 
the 
Wolverines 
managed to steal a win by 
just three-tenths of a point. 
Despite the win, Michigan was 
unhappy with its 
performance.
“Quite 
honestly, 
I 
was 
very 
disappointed,” 
Michigan coach 
Bev 
Plocki 
said. 
“Very 
disappointed 
with beam and 
not very excited 
about 
floor 
either.”
In the rest of their season, the 
Wolverines will look to capitalize 
on their larget contributors — 
the underclassmen. With four 
new freshmen, Michigan isn’t 
panicking.
“I have to remind myself that 
there’s pressure,” Plocki said. 
“The freshmen are still learning 
how to handle that. So I’m not 
concerned for the season, I think 
we’re going to turn around the 
mistakes we made, and I think 
that we’re on track to have a great 
season.”
Michigan is ready to lock back 
in.

Wolverines want more scoring from 
defensemen in second half of season

Mel Pearson has spent the last 
couple of weeks emphasizing 
Michigan’s need to get more 
offensive 
output 
from 
its 
defensemen. In Saturday night’s 
win over then-No. 14 Notre 
Dame, Pearson saw what he’d 
been pushing come to fruition.
Sophomore defenseman Nick 
Blankenburg scored the game-
tying goal in the second period, 
and fellow sophomore blueliner 
Jack Summers followed with the 
game winner just a few minutes 
later. Blankenburg also notched 
an assist on senior forward Jake 
Slaker’s empty-net goal, and 
freshman defenseman Cam York 
made the pass to Blankenburg 
for his goal. 
It was just what Pearson was 
hoping to see.
“We got some goals from 
our defensemen,” Pearson said 
Saturday night. “We’ve been 
talking about that the last couple 
weeks. We need to get more 
offense from our defensemen, 
just the way teams play.”
On 
Monday, 
Pearson 
elaborated 
on 
why 
getting 
offensive production from the 
blueline is so key with the way 
teams play these days.
“You can almost draw a line 
from the back of the boards 
through the dots up to the top of 
the circles and everybody packs 
it in and gives you the perimeter,” 
Pearson said. “Most teams are 
going to give you the outside. 
It’s not like basketball where 
you have to defend a 3-point 
shot or anything like that, so 
everybody just packs it in. And 
then you’ve got to try to get it 
through them and the goalie, so 
your defensemen are gonna have 
the puck a lot and they’re gonna 
have to make plays.”
With 
Summers’ 
and 
Blankenburg’s goals on Saturday, 
the work the defensive corps 
has been doing in practice this 
season began to show up.
Nearly every day in practice, 
the Wolverines run drills that 
require defensemen to have the 

puck on their stick and make 
a play to get it to the net. On 
Monday, the first drill of the day 
involved two forwards at the net 
front, working on tipping in shots 
from defensemen at the blueline. 
It was far from the only drill 
where Michigan’s defensemen 
were put in position to score.
“In 
practice, 
when 
the 
(defensemen) are joining the 
rush, just trying to score and 
bury your chances,” York said. 
“A lot of times, you’re out there 
defending 
for 
a 
while 
and 
it’s hard to join the rush just 
because you’re tired or you’re 
out of breath or whatever, but 
just trying to get an extra leg 
and help out the forwards in the 
offensive zone as much as we can 
is big for us and will help us score 
goals.”
Summers’ 
game-winner 
exemplified what York means 
about the defensemen helping 
the forwards in the offensive 
zone.
As 
senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
worked 
through 
the top of the offensive zone 
with the puck, Summers moved 
toward the front of the net. It 
put him in position to receive a 
pass through the zone and send a 
backhand shot into the net’s top 
corner — a play typically made by 
a forward, but with Lockwood 
up by the blueline, Summers 
crashed down to take that spot.
“(Summers’) goal, especially, 
I think that’s big,” Blankenburg 
said. “Kinda jumping down when 

that forward comes up. I feel like 
that’s kinda what we envision 
when we want (defensemen) to 
jump up in the play, especially 
when we had possession in the 
(offensive) zone.”
The 
Wolverines 
have 
particularly 
put 
focus 
on 
defensemen jumping up in the 
play to create odd-man rushes 
and add pressure in the offensive 
zone.
Through the first half of the 
season, blueliners like senior 
Griffin Luce — who has 12 points 
in 117 career games — could 
often be seen joining the rush, 
even when it was unlikely they’d 
be scoring themselves. Simply 
having the extra person up in 
the play increases the chances 
of getting an outnumbered rush 
or the defending team leaving a 
forward wide open for a scoring 
chance.
“Having a fourth guy in the 
rush, creating a four-on-two or 
whatever, you have a lot better 
chance of scoring and creating 
opportunities,” York said. “I 
think going into the second half, 
we need to do a lot more of it and 
it’ll help us out a lot.”
Defensemen accounted for 
two of Michigan’s six goals 
in its sweep over the Fighting 
Irish — just its second sweep of 
the season. As the Wolverines 
look to string wins together 
and turn their season around in 
the second half, Pearson will be 
looking to his defensive corps to 
help make it happen.

I

t’s just frustrating.
Frustrating watching 
a Michigan women’s bas-
ketball team that’s showed its 
potential over and over again.
Frustrating, knowing that 
even when 
just three 
of its play-
ers are 
on their 
A-game, 
the team 
can com-
pete with 
anyone.
Frustrat-
ing, know-
ing that 
rarely happens.
Sophomore guard Amy Dilk 
can cut apart defenses on her 
way to the basket. Sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon can be 
unstoppable down low. Junior 
forward Hailey Brown defies 
her position, raining down 
threes. Senior forward Kayla 
Robbins takes two steps, and 
suddenly she has a wide open 
layup. Senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson locks down opposing 
defenses.
After the Wolverines beat 
Michigan State on Jan. 5, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico referred to multiple 
plays when everything was 
clicking and where secondary 
scoring targets came up huge, 
namely from the 3-point line.
“Sometimes we miss those, 
and when we miss them it’s 
a different type of game,” 
Barnes Arico said. “But 
tonight we made them, and 
that’s something our team 
works on every day, is making 
those shots and having the 
confidence to take those shots 
in big games, and tonight we 
did both of those things.”
The problem is, when it’s 
against good opponents, 
more often it’s “most of the 
time” instead of “sometimes.” 
Brown and Johnson go cold 
from three. Dilk and Robbins 
get stonewalled in the lane. 
Hillmon is suffocated at the 
post. There’s no bench help, 
no spark.
In Sunday’s 77-49 loss to 
No. 17 Maryland all the dirty 

secrets of Michigan bubbled 
up at once on the court. Turn-
overs, turnovers, turnovers. 
No 3-pointers, no momentum 
swingers, no penetration. 
Barnes Arico said they were 
pressing, forcing the extra 
pass. Johnson pointed to the 
Terps’ athleticism, how the 
Wolverines are still getting 
used to competing against 
high-level opponents — a 
hangover from a weak non-
conference schedule.
They couldn’t springboard 
off their defense, one of 
the best in the conference, 
because they lost the ball at 
halfcourt more often than 
they made a shot.
“So much of it is mental as 
much as it is physical at this 
point,” Barnes Arico said. 
“But Naz Hillmon, Kayla Rob-
bins, Amy Dilk are better than 
turning the basketball over 
that many times.”
And they are. In the second 
half of the game against the 
Spartans, Michigan shot 77.7 
percent from the field. Dilk 
and Hillmon plowed through 
anything Michigan State 
threw at them, and in the 
fourth quarter the Wolverines 
didn’t turn the ball over.
After that high, though, 
Michigan faced another rival 
in Ohio State. On the road, in a 
barely inhabited arena. Just as 
it seemed the team was click-
ing — its wheels oiled, rolling, 
coming for you — the Wolver-
ines laid an egg.

As quickly as Brown’s con-
fidence had reappeared, it 
disappeared. When driving 
to the basket, Robbins and 
Dilk were repelled and only 
Hillmon could find success 
under the basket — until Ohio 
State decided to defend the 
only thing working for Michi-
gan. The bench, showcasing a 
spark, perhaps, in the Michi-
gan State game, returned to 
being seat-heaters.
A dud’s a dud, though there 
were bigger fish to fry — a 
rematch with ranked Mary-
land. A chance to even the 
score, show this team can beat 
one of the best in the country. 
That game wasn’t a dud, it was 
an implosion.
The puzzle, nearly com-
plete, fell apart.
Maybe now that the Wol-
verines came so close to real-
izing their potential, they’ll 
only take a couple days rest 
or a win over a struggling 
Wisconsin to get their mojo 
back. A couple of games where 
they’re in control, where they 
can get their confidence back.
After all, last season Michi-
gan went through a January 
where it lost five of six games 
before ending the season win-
ning eight of nine.
This year, there are 13 
games left to put the puzzle 
back together.
