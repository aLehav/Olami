Detroit mayor discusses 
urban improvement plans

Duggan aims to give 
affordable housing 
to local residents 

By KEVIN BIGLIN

Daily Staff Reporter

In 
his 
Wednesday 
evening 

keynote address at the Mackinac 
Policy Conference, Detroit Mayor 
Mike Duggan talked about housing 
history in Detroit and about his new 
urban planning strategy, which 
aims to spread affordable housing 
units across all areas of the city.

He posed the question, “What 

kind of a city do we want to be?” He 
said Detroit is in its first period of 
growth in over 50 years and every 
urban planning measure taken by 
the government, business leaders 
and citizens matters.

Duggan said the current urban 

planning strategy is defined by 
the slogan “One City. For all of 
us.” This means having people 
of all backgrounds living and 
working with each other in all 
neighborhoods of the city.

Success for Duggan is making 

sure everyone currently in the city 
can stay there while having more 
people move in. He said he favors 
the growth of areas with incoming 
immigrant populations as well as 
keeping young talent in the city.

“We’re 
pro-immigration,” 

Duggan said. “We want all our 
talent to stay in the city. We believe 
deeply this city is going to be 
welcoming to everybody. But we’re 
not going to move out Detroiters so 
other people can move in.”

Duggan said under the Federal 

Housing Administration’s unfair 
policy of “redlining” during the 
World War II era and beyond, 
several neighborhoods in the city 
became segregated. The policy 
made it so low-income minority 
groups were unable to receive loans 
to pay for houses in “desirable” 
communities.

“Urban 
redevelopment 
in 

America has historically across the 
country been about removing the 
poor,” Duggan said. “In Detroit, 
you have to go back to what 
happened before World War II. The 
caucasians coming from the South 

could live anywhere in the city. 
But the African Americans were 
confined to these neighborhoods. 
The way Detroit looks today 
is directly rooted in planning 
decisions that the leaders of this 
community made in the 1940s and 
the 1950s. That was the last period 
of growth in Detroit. Many of those 
decisions were rooted in racial 
discrimination.”

Duggan revealed eight principles 

the city will follow to achieve 
redevelopment, including allowing 
people of all incomes in any 
neighborhood to fight economic 
segregation and not supporting 
development if it displaces current 
Detroit residents, among others.

The mayor said the city won’t 

give tax breaks to developers who 
displace citizens in affordable 
housing. Instead, he is trying to 
work out deals with them to make 
space for such housing.

“We sat down with the Roxbury 

Group, worked out a deal, they 
bought the building, we gave them 
some support and they guaranteed 
thirty years of affordable housing,”

Nikolai Vitti spoke on 
new ways businesses 
 

can help students in 
DPS be successful

By KEVIN BIGLIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Nikolai 
Vitti, 
Detroit 
Public 

Schools 
Community 
District 

Superintendent, discussed ways in 
which the business community can 
help ensure Detroit children succeed 
in the classroom and are prepared 
for opportunities after graduation in 
a panel Wednesday morning at the 
Mackinac Policy Conference.

Vitti was selected by the school 

board in April to take over for 
interim chief Alycia Meriweather.

According to the Detroit News, his 

duties include overseeing more than 
48,000 students, 6,000 employees 
and a fiscal budget of $660 million.

Vitti said he plans on bringing 

major changes to the district, with 
significant ones coming in the 2018 
to 2019 school year. Specifically, 
he said literacy standards must 
improve, teacher salaries must rise 
and the business community must 
continue to help with providing 
opportunities to students.

In the district, 27 percent of 

fourth graders are at or above a 
basic reading level, whereas the 
national average is 69 percent of 
fourth graders at or above that 
level, according to a 2015 National 
Assessment of Education Progress 
report. Students are also struggling 
in mathematics.

“I think access is important, but 

we have to talk about quality,” Vitti

Ward 1 candidate Anne Bannister looks 
to bring transparency to city council

Bannister, a life 
long Democrat, 

said she was 

encouraged to run 
by her neighbors

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

On Tuesday, August 8, Ann Arbor 

residents will vote in the primary 
election for City Council. In Ward 
1, 
Democrat 
Anne 
Bannister 

is challenging the incumbent, 
Democrat Jason Frenzel, who 
lost 
to 
Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy 
in 
last 
year’s 

election, but was appointed by 
the council to fill a vacancy left 
by Councilmember Sabra Briere’s 
abrupt resignation.

Bannister, a lifelong Democrat, 

University of Michigan alum and 
now Certified Financial Planner, 
said she was encouraged to run 
by neighbors who felt their voices 
weren’t being heard by City 
Council. She joined the Daily for 
an interview Monday to discuss 

who she is, why she’s running, and 
what she sees as the main issues 
facing Ann Arbor city government.

TMD: Let’s start with the 

basics. Why do you want to be on 
City Council?

AB: Well, I’m a 43-year resident 

of the town, and I moved into 
the first ward — so I’ve been 27 
years with my neighbors down 
here in the first ward. And I’m a 
personal finance educator. That’s 
my background. Running for City 
Council was not on my radar. I do 
volunteer, I’m going to Huron High 
this Wednesday as a guest speaker 
in the economics class, and my 
main work is in educating people 
in the basics of personal finance. 

But then in April, community 

activists started to get concerned 
about 
the 
existing 
council 

members that were not listening 
to the residents enough, that they 
were disregarding a little bit of the 
public process in things that we, 
as residents, feel that we need a 
bigger voice in. They’re also a little 
bit brushing aside local business 
too. As an educator, I want to 
help people understand a little bit 
more about — you know, we all 
understand national politics, and 

even quite a bit about state politics 
— but when it comes down to the 
city decisions that are affecting 
long-term effects on the future 
of Ann Arbor, I find that people 
don’t know what ward they’re in, 
they don’t know who their council 
member is, and they’re not sure 
about anything. So that’s one 
of the reasons I’m running, is 
to help people understand the 

decisions that are being made 
that affect us, without having to 
decipher — I want to decipher 
it for them. It’s not about Anne 

Bannister’s 
opinion 
about 

anything. It’s about listening 
to the neighbors and the voices, 
and what they feel are priorities 
in the city, and then trying to 
represent those voices at the 
council meetings.

TMD: By running for a Ward 

1 seat, you’re going to inherently 
be challenging the incumbent 
Jason Frenzel. What are your 
thoughts on your opponent?

AB: I’ve been a friend of 

Jason’s for years. I bump into 
him out on the hiking trails in 
our neighborhood, and I’m also 
friends with his (step)mom, 
Sandi Smith. So it’s not a big 
divisive race — we’ve all been 
friends. 

But I think, back in April, 

when 
community 
activists 

were concerned about some of 
the vote ... we have a public lot 
downtown next to the public 
library, and our taxpayers own 
that lot, and we own the parking 
structure underneath it. That’s a 
public piece of land. There were 
petitions; 5,647 people signed 
that they wanted a bigger voice 
in creating some sort of different 
development on that lot. I want 

to put people first and bring that 
voice to City Council and make 
sure that we are represented in 
these decisions that are forever 
going to change Ann Arbor.

TMD: 
You’re 
a 
Certified 

Financial 
Planner. 
Can 
you 

explain a little more about what 
that means, and how you think it 
prepares you to be on Council?

AB: The Certified Financial 

Planner designation — roughly 
only half of the people in the 
country who sit for that exam 
actually pass it. It’s sort of a gold 
standard for people in financial 
planning. And not only does it 
show that we’ve really studied 
taxes — so I’m a lifelong financial 
person, I started out as a bank 
teller when I was at U of M. 

One of the things — and maybe 

this is too big of a word — is 
fiduciary. I’m a big believer that 
the person sitting across the table 
from you, whether you’re their 
financial planner, or whether 
they’re your neighbor and you’re 
on City Council, people need to 
know that person is representing 
your best interests. We call it the 
fiduciary. In order to be a CFP, 
you have to take ethics courses 
every two years to make sure 
that you understand that you 
don’t represent any particular 
investment 
or 
commercial 

interest, you represent the best 
interests of the person who’s 
seeking your advice, who thinks 
you’re protecting them. If my 
neighbors tell me that they want 
better safety at the crosswalk, then 
I want to take that voice and work 
to make sure that the city’s actions 
and budget priorities reflect what 
people are saying they need. So 
it’s a code of ethics, where I’m 
just a plain old resident, and I’m 
not running for a political career, 
I’m not running because I’m a real 
estate developer or anything, I’m 
running just because I’m 53 years 
old, and it feels good to me to do 
the right thing for the people for 
the greater good and to listen to 
what their priorities are.

TMD: Walk me through your 

political experience. I know you 
served a variety of roles in the Ann 
Arbor Democratic Party, but what 
kinds of things did you do, and 
what did it provide you?

Campus and city leaders reflect on immigration events 
in Ann Arbor community, discuss action moving forward

Leaders on campus 
and the city of Ann 
Arbor affirm strong 
intent to protect the 
immigrant populace

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

In the aftermath of incidents 

involving immigration spanning 
several months, campus and Ann 
Arbor leaders affirm a strong intent 
to protect immigrants in the area, in 
reaction to the new political climate 
created during President Donald J. 
Trump’s first 100 days.

Earlier this month, the Washt-

enaw County Board of Commission-
ers pledged $145,000 in taxpayer 
funds to services for immigrants and 
undocumented residents. The board 
passed three resolutions by a vote 
of 6 to 1 — one of which affirms the 
funding, while the other two pre-
vent county officials from asking for 
an individual’s immigration status 

under most circumstances and ask 
Congress to modify immigration 
policy such that it “creates clear and 
reasonable immigration sanctions 
short of deportation for noncitizens 
convicted of crimes.”

The funds are to be split between 

the Barrier Busters coalition — sev-
eral agencies that provide short-term 
support for citizens and immigrants 
— and the Michigan Immigrant 
Rights Center, a resource for immi-
grants and immigrant advocates in 
Michigan.

In a May interview, Sara Cusack, 

an LSA alum who now works for 
MIRC said the funding will be very 
useful, speaking for herself and not 
as a representative of MIRC.

“The grant that Washtenaw just 

agreed to give to MIRC… will hope-
fully in the future allow us to have an 
attorney who focuses on immigra-
tion matters specifically in Washt-
enaw County, whereas right now 
we serve all of Michigan broadly 
and have really limited resources,” 
Cusack said. “We have to be very 
stringent about what types of cases 
we can take, and so what Washt-
enaw County is kind of saying by 

giving this donation to MIRC is that 
they’re investing in the wellbeing of 
immigrants and their community.”

In Ann Arbor, the city council is 

no stranger to immigration support 
either.

In an interview, City Coun-

cil Member Chuck Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 5) reflected back on the 
work the council has done in recent 
months to protect immigrants.

“I think, in broad strokes, Ann 

Arbor is a diverse community and 
immigrants are important members 
of our community — both document-
ed and undocumented,” he said. “We 
want to make our community safe 
and welcoming for everybody.”

In January, the council passed 

a resolution urging then-President 
Barack Obama to protect students 
who applied to the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrivals program.

Established by Obama in 2012, 

DACA allows undocumented immi-
grant youth, under certain circum-
stances, to receive a deferral from 
deportation as well as a work permit.

At the council meeting, Jessica 

Provinski, a member of BAMN — 
the Coalition to Defend Affirmative

New DPS Superintendent Nikolai Vitti discusses major changes he plans to 
implement in the school district next year.

Action, Integration and Immigrant 
Rights and Fight for Equality By Any 
Means Necessary — said she hoped to 
see Obama sign one last order before 
he left office.

“(Obama) must use his executive 

power to do everything he can to 
defend young immigrant recipients 
of the DACA program,” Provinski 
said. “If we are to defend each other 
and our society from a dark future, 
we must protect the most vulnerable 
of us.”

One day prior to the passage of the 

resolution, on Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day, the University Michigan chap-
ter of BAMN organized a protest 
against the inauguration of President 
Donald Trump, specifically oppos-
ing his plans to change immigration 
reform.

The week prior, Central Student 

Government passed a resolution ask-
ing Obama to protect undocumented 
students by a vote of 26 to 4 with 7 
abstaining. The policy, introduced 
by BAMN, asked CSG to send a state-
ment to the White House in support 
of DACA students. A similar resolu-
tion, authored by memeber of the OG 
execuvtive board, had, in fact, passed 

CSG last December, though at the 
time only served to express solidarity 
with undocumented students.

Additionally, in late January, Uni-

versity President Mark Schlissel 
released a statement to affirm the 
University’s commitment to inter-
national students and faculty. The 
statement was written in response to 
an executive order signed by Trump 
banning immigration and travel of 
people from many Muslim-majority 
countries. 

Despite 
all 
such 
measures, 

undocumented students at the 
University still worry for their 
futures under the Trump adminis-
tration. In February, four undocu-
mented individuals were detained 
by U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement during a raid in Ypsi-
lanti.

In a March interview, a female 

student, who asked to remain anon-
ymous due to concern for the safety 
of herself and her family, described 
the fear associated with living as 
an undocumented resident.

Duggan said. “We can do this. And 
we can keep people downtown.”

On the topic of economic 

segregation, Duggan said the 
city will not help finance any 
housing development unless they 
allocate at least 20 percent to 
being affordable units. The mayor 
turned to successes of this policy 
with the Strathmore apartments 
in midtown. They were renovated 
over the last three years and now 
offer 40 percent of their units to 
lower-income renters.

“I’ve got 20 separate projects 

across 
the 
downtown 
and 

midtown 
area 
with 
1,000 

guaranteed 
affordable 
units,” 

Duggan said. “Instead of being 
stuck over here in six towers, 
with the poor in one place, and 
everybody else somewhere else, 
we spread the affordable housing 
across downtown and midtown 
because this is what we believe as 
a city.”

Another principle for Duggan 

over the past three years has been 

blight removal. While restoring 
as many houses as possible and 
removing those deemed unsafe, 
Detroit has been able to increase 
property values.

“The 
homesale 
prices 
are 

up 50 percent,” Duggan said. 
“If you listen to the media, you 
would think it’s in downtown 
and 
midtown, 
and 
nothing’s 

happening in the neighborhoods. 
In the neighborhoods, they know 
that the great majority of the 
neighborhoods have seen home 
improvements of more than 50 
percent in the property values.”

The city is removing urban 

blight at an unprecedented rate, 
with 4,000 houses being torn 
down per year, which is four 
times faster than any other U.S. 
city. Duggan said 1,500 formerly 
vacant houses are now fully 
restored and another 1,500 are in 
the process of rehabilitation.

“People thought Detroit had no 

future,” Duggan said. “When you 
take out the burned down houses 
on the block, people will buy the 
other houses.”

said. “It can’t just be babysitting. It 
has to be deep intervention and 
literacy development. I think the 
opportunity for the school district 
is to have curriculum that’s directly 
aligned to the standards. We can’t 
wait until third grade to make sure 
students are on grade level.”

A 
major 
factor 
inhibiting 

educational 
development, 

according to Vitti, is poverty. 
This, he said, leads to social and 
emotional distress, which wears on 
many students’ ability to learn.

“We 
can’t 
talk 
about 
our 

children and our school system 
without talking about poverty,” 
Vitti said. “There has to be ways 
of overcoming literacy challenges 
at young ages, early learning 
opportunities, access to address 
social and emotional needs, mental 
wellness needs — those are real 
factors that get in the way of being 
on grade level in reading, math 
science and social studies.”

OPINION

A 

question I hate is one, 
like 
clockwork, 
that 
I 

find 
myself 
answering 

every year beginning in April and 
through June. And after summer? 
It becomes a question in the past 
tense. I don’t like that question for 
largely two reasons. Firstly, because 
I sometimes don’t know what I’m 
going to be doing and secondly, it’s 
often not nearly as cool as what 
others are doing. But even more so 
because follow up questions almost 
always lead to the “paid or unpaid” 
question.

Sheepishly, I would sometimes 

admit to someone that I am not 
getting paid, quickly adding that I 
know I’m very fortunate to be able 
to have the position. But sometimes, 
hopefully trying to avoid further 
conversation, I would be somewhat 
vague as to my position — hoping 
that the person won’t ask the 
question in the first place.

Before I go further, I want to 

make it clear that I recognize 
that 
some 
people 
who 
need 

to 
get 
a 
paying 
job 
might 

feel 
uncomfortable 
in 
these 

conversations 
as 
they 
cannot 

necessarily accept a potentially 
exciting position because it is 
unpaid. Here, though, I can only 
speak to my experiences, and for 
me, what made me uncomfortable 
about this question was I had to 
recognize my privilege.

For the past two summers, I’ve 

worked at a few law organizations 
as an unpaid intern, learning 
extensively about asylum law and 
the procedure to gain legal status 

in the United States, as well as 
observing the workings of different 
civil courts and the process of 
eviction cases. Though I am 
certainly not ready to take the Bar 
or anything, there is no doubt I have 
gained valuable experience. And as 
became evident in interviews for 
internship positions, my unpaid, 
stipend positions at the Daily 
helped me get these jobs. These are 

experiences I likely would not have 
had if I needed a full-time paying 
job throughout the year. 

Furthermore, 
though 
being 

enrolled in top schools is still 
important, recent findings make it 
clear that something else is often 
what sets some job candidates 
apart. 
Lauren 
A. 
Rivera, 
a 

researcher 
at 
Northwestern 

University, found that it wasn’t 
enough for someone to hail from 
an elite university. Extracurricular 
activities have become a large 
part of what recruiters for elite 
companies are looking for in their 
interns.

More 
frequently 
now 
than 

ever before, recruiters are doing 
what Rivera calls a “secondary 
screening” — looking for people 
who have also done “high status, 
resource-intensive 
activities” 

outside of the classroom. And these 
types of activities, according to 
Rivera, are most specifically in line 
with the activities of those who 
are white and in the upper-middle 
class. This practice “contributes to 
a social closure of elite jobs based 
on socio-economic status.”

The 
bottom 
line? 
Having 

the 
ability 
to 
partake 
in 

extracurricular 
activities 
that 

do 
not 
pay, 
getting 
unpaid 

internship experiences that will 
give them more of a leg up, helps 
tremendously in the long run. And 
unfortunately, without change, 
this structure will continue to 
perpetuate inequalities, which is 
especially dire given the studies 
that show how certain groups of 
people — especially minorities — 
disproportionately face financial 
barriers to these opportunities.

Nonetheless, I am not trying to 

say that people who work multiple 
jobs cannot also hold unpaid 
internships simultaneously. My 
intent is not to paint a picture 
that diminishes anyone’s ability 
to balance many responsibilities. 
I know many people who have 
multiple paying jobs and do 
amazing internships. But even so, 
there will be some internships that 
won’t be possible, or they will not 
get time to do other things and 
further their interests outside of 
work and internships. Finances

“What are you doing this summer?”

shouldn’t ever be a barrier, but they 
are, and we need to do something 
about it.

Those who can work the most 

rigorous, 
all-encompassing 

internships, those who can afford 
to be paid very little if nothing 
at all, have their pick of a much 
larger 
number 
of 
internships. 

Those who can spend hours 
each week in organizations as an 
undergraduate, those who can 
volunteer extensively at nonprofits, 
are the ones whose resumes will 
presumably be sent to the top of the 
pile when they apply for jobs.

I 
know 
many 
smaller 

organizations 
— 
non-profits, 

for example, that are helping 
people of low income — cannot, 
understandably so, pay a bunch 
of students to do some filing and 
shadow lawyers to court. But I 
implore the organizations that have 
the capabilities to do so to really 
invest in their interns.

And the University of Michigan 

must also do its part. I can tell 
you now, administrators, if you’re 
reading this, that what I won’t 
remember is the extra comfy chairs 
in the study room in Mason Hall, 
or the extra shine of the building 
plaque. But what I will remember 
are the nights I was at the Daily 
until 2 a.m. to publish an editorial 
alongside a breaking news story. 
I’ll remember standing for nearly 
24 hours at Dance Marathon. I’ll 
remember learning about asylum 
law and sitting in on cases at 
eviction court.

I know funding is often tied up 

in a specific entity, I know it’s not 
as simple as reallocating funds 
and all that stuff. But to encourage 
diversity, to attract people from all 
walks of life, I ask that the University 
take the lead in continuing to 
create and promote scholarships 
for students to take on leadership 
roles in campus organizations and 
summer internships so everyone 
has a more equal chance at the best 
opportunities.

Central Student Government’s 

scholarship is an important start, 
but we need more. Everyone, 
regardless 
of 
their 
financial 

situation, deserves a chance to 
thrive. Because when given the 
tools, more often than not, people 
will take these opportunities and 
thrive. And furthermore, everyone 
deserves the chance to do what 
they love and not worry about the 
financial barriers. This might seem 
overly optimistic, but even as a 
person who leans pessimistic more 
often than not, I truly believe we 
can work toward giving everyone 
these chances.

And for the individuals who 

may be reading this and frustrated 
because you think I am telling you 
to forgo your job at the American 
Embassy to stand up against 
unpaid internships, I’m not. Keep 
your plane ticket, move into your 
apartment and enjoy your job. But 
I implore you to recognize it as a 
privilege. There are many students, 
as summer rolls around, who can’t 
afford to pick and choose their jobs 
or internships because they need 
to work somewhere that will pay 
them. They can’t go out-of-state or 
abroad because that would mean 
finding housing and transportation. 
Be thankful for what you have, and 
do your part to work to shape the 
future.

Whether 
it’s 
committing 
to 

continue research like Rivera’s, 
writing articles exposing these 
inequalities, advocating for changes 
to work policies, writing grants 
or lobbying for scholarships for 
students to do unpaid internships 
or take on a leadership role in a 
student 
organization, 
everyone 

can make a difference. Changes to 
the system don’t only have to come 
from the ones with millions of 
dollars to give to charities. Big 
or small, what you do will make 
a difference.

OPINION

Thursday, June 1, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I

f you were to ask me today 
what 
I’m 
studying, 
I’d 

reply with full confidence 

and a bright smile: “I’m pre-
pharmacy!” After all, pharmacy 
was always the only profession 
in which I could truly see 
myself.

But a year ago, I would’ve 

told you I was pre-med.

For a long time, I tried to 

believe that medicine was what 
I truly wanted to pursue. I tried 
to convince myself that bloody 
operation 
videos 
interested 

me, that my hyper-sentimental 
self was strong enough for the 
emotional ride of life and death 
at the bedside.

While I knew I wanted to 

work in healthcare, to treat 
patients, to apply the science 
that I so loved, I also knew I 
was not meant to be a doctor. So 
why did I pretend?

In short, I fell victim to a 

common misconception about 
the 
health 
professions, 
an 

unspoken axiom:

Pharmacists are just a lesser 

version of doctors.

Perhaps it’s why so many 

freshmen claim to be pre-med, 
and why so many pharmacy 
students 
hesitated 
to 
walk 

down this path in the first 
place. After all, doctors are the 
ones saving the lives, writing 
the 
prescriptions. 
They’re 

the ones we fear as children 
and respect as adults, who’ve 
triumphed through decades of 
school to receive the emblem of 
expertise and prestige.

And I do not resent this, 

because they indeed are all 
of those things — in a perfect 
world, I would want to be one of 
them. But that doesn’t change 
a less popular fact: medicine 
and pharmacy are two entirely 
different professions.

Hence, it didn’t help when, 

after I’ve finally found the 
conviction to call myself pre-
pharm, not everyone I knew or 
met was prepared to hear it.

While I got the usual “Cool’s 

and Wow’s,” I began to notice a 
different, distinctly unsettling 
trend:

“Wait, I thought you’d be 

pre-med because you’re smart!”

“Is it because med school is 

too hard?”

And my personal favorite: 

“Nice, that’s so much easier 
than being a doctor!”

Whether 
or 
not 
these 

comments 
were 
meant 
as 

compliments, I could not help 
but feel insulted. It confused 
me how people were so quick 
to 
compare 
pharmacy 
to 

medicine. It frustrated me how 
they accepted the stereotype so 
readily, without even realizing 
there was one. Most of all, it 
hurt me that they could assign 
a finite level of competence to a 
career choice that was entirely 
my own.

Nevertheless, 
I 
couldn’t 

blame them. After all, compared 
to medicine, pharmacy is far 
less talked about as a profession. 
It 
was 
understandable 
that 

those outside of the health field 
tended to group the two into 
one muddled “clinical bubble.”

But it was not excusable. We 

cannot speak for what we do 
not know.

Though all these comments 

hurt, they hit the hardest when 
pre-med students themselves 
were at the outgoing end of 
them. To give the benefit of the 
doubt, I do not believe they did 
so because they feel superior to 
me, or because they have too 
much pride to admit they are 
not. The issue, as it often is, is 
nothing more than ignorance.

We don’t teach it to our kids: 

while 
the 
doctor’s 
playing 

field is the human body and 
all that could go wrong with 
it, the pharmacist specializes 
on exogenous medications and 
the body’s specific responses 
to 
them. 
And 
though 
it’s 

tempting to think that this 
means simply putting pills in 
bottles at your local CVS, there 
is a large variety of settings 
at which pharmacists work 
and an even larger scientific 
skill set required to do so. 
Just as pharmacists cannot 
be “promoted” to physicians, 
physicians cannot “step down” 
and be pharmacists when the 
job gets too hard. They are 

different in title, degree and 
specialty, but NOT extent of 
capability.

In a hospital setting, where 

the 
“doctor’s 
superiority” 

assumption is perhaps most 
expected, this difference is 
clear. According to second-year 
Pharmacy student Cecilia Li, 
a current intern at Beaumont 
Hospital, the two professions 
practice 
separate 
specialties 

and contribute equally to the 
healthcare system.

“There are the pharmacists 

who stand passively in the 
corner of the room, but the 
majority are extremely active, 
knowledgeable 
and 
function 

at the same level as doctors,” 
she said. “Sometimes, if I were 
to close my eyes and listen, 
I couldn’t tell if it was the 
pharmacist or the physician 
talking.”

Which just goes to show 

that 
pharmacists 
are, 
like 

doctors, nurses, dentists — or 
any profession, for that matter 
— respected only as much as 
their 
personal 
performance 

warrants. It’s only fair, as 
it should be. At last, I have 
found the self-assurance and 
validation that is so, so long 
overdue.

While becoming an actual 

pharmacist is quite a way down 
the road for me, my choice to 
become one is certainly not a 
measure of my intelligence, 
ambition 
or 
aptitude. 
Too 

many times over the past year, 
I’ve let ignorant and offhand 
judgements 
come 
close 
to 

dictating my entire future, and 
I’m tired of it.

I’m tired of dreading self-

introductions, 
in 
fear 
that 

sharing my major will brand 
an unwanted label across my 
forehead. I’m tired of secretly 
wishing I’d done worse in 
school, just to justify myself 
for taking a “dumber” career 
path. I’m tired of pretending, 
and even more tired of being 
ashamed.

Now, I know I don’t have 

to. Each and every profession 
deserves merit in its own right, 
and should be treated as such.

A major misunderstanding
What I’ve learned by traveling abroad
I 

am always surprised by h ow 
much larger places are than I 
imagine. With every arrival to a 

new country, my imagination collides 
head-on with the realities of the 
world as my flight descends toward 
a new airport. Every single time, 
I am overwhelmed with the first 
glance out of the plane window of my 
destination below — overwhelmed 
by the seemingly endless cities, 
the sheer magnitude of land and 
the countless number of invisible 
people, all carrying on with their 
lives oblivious to yet another tourist 
who is about to desperately attempt 
to “understand” their country and 
culture.

And I am overwhelmed because 

our imaginations are selfish, they 
never prepare us for how much more 
diverse and massive the world really 
is. Our imaginations are constricted 
to storylines and creations related 
solely to ourselves, and as an 
American 
tourist, 
that 
means 

deceiving us into believing the world 
is small, filled with few people who 
matter, and that foreign countries are 
simply playgrounds that will adhere 
to our schedules and are meant to be 
explored with our U.S. passports and 
Canon cameras.

Yet this is never the reality I have 

experienced abroad. Instead of 
the false narratives pictured in my 
imagination of a smaller world that 
is easy to explore and discover, I am 
immediately humbled by both the 
size and complexity with my arrival 
somewhere new.

With every country, whether it 

be the island of Iceland located near 
the Arctic Circle, or Spain on the 
warm Mediterranean Sea — the 
world and its people immediately 
become materialized and brought to 
life, overwhelming my self-absorbed 
imagination and helping to expand 
my understanding of reality outside of 
our borders. To see that everywhere, 
life goes on, no matter how different 
it may be from the suburban lifestyles 
of the United States.

The 
once-invisible 
people 
I 

imagined from the airplane window 
above 
instantly 
become 
real. 

Mothers with strollers on the metro, 
families rushing to dinner, homeless 
people begging near bus stops — the 
world suddenly collides with my 
imagination, and I realize how much 
smaller and more insignificant I am.

Because having the luxury of 

being an American tourist means 
that you have the opportunity to 
properly invest your time abroad into 
some actual character building. To 
step out of the tourist gimmicks and 

traps, and past the cliché Instagram-
tailored adventures and day trips 
— and instead, wade into the daily 
life of foreign cities and towns and 
experience how people still exist 
with the same stresses and desires 
outside of our borders.

Everywhere in the world, people 

want not just security, food, shelter 
or even democracy — but the same 
complex lives with all the same 
emotions we develop back home. 
Everywhere, human beings are 
being human. They want to laugh 
with friends, argue over sports or 
competitions, to fall in love.

My imagination never pictures 

that when I think of some foreign 
country. And that is why every 
opportunity I have to travel abroad, 
I continually embrace the awe I 
have over the size and complexity 
of the world and human life outside 
of my small suburban bubble. That 
hopefully my imagination — which 
was shaped by an adolescence living 
in an over-ambitious capitalistic 
global superpower — will one day 
be curbed and grow in empathy and 
understanding. To not picture the 
world as small, but remember how 
humbled I was by the view out of a 
plane window. To remember that 
these far-away places are filled with 
people like me.

There is a common desire among 

the young, educated millennials I 
know to travel to and experience 
as many countries in the world as 
possible. I believe there exists this 
obsession (amplified by the photo-
worthiness of social media) to 
backpack across continents, and one 
day adorn a trendy IKEA-saturated 
apartment with souvenirs from 
Nepal to Brazil. And though on 
the surface, such goals may seem 
shallow and reflect a thinking that 
the world is just a playground to 
explore — individuals can utilize 
such trips to develop a greater sense 
of empathy, trips not for souvenirs 
and photos, but memories of others 
and experiences in new lives.

And hopefully, my generation will 

be one to understand the necessity 
and importance of international 
cooperation. That my generation, 
despite our domestic problems 
and strife, will be able to develop a 
sense of empathy not only for the 
disadvantaged 
domestically 
but 

internationally, as well. I hope that 
my generation will not look for 
differences between people, but 
instead embrace commonalities.

‘Baywatch’ flops 

By FALLON GATES

Daily Arts Writer

With big time actors Dwayne ‘The 

Rock’ Johnson (“Fast and Furious”) 
and Zac Efron (“The Lucky One”), 
“Baywatch” (for many fans) raised 
the hope of a hilarious summer action 
comedy. Unfortunately, it didn’t come 
close to reaching these standards and 
left the audience wondering if a plot 
could be even more uncreative than 
this one.

Director Seth Gordon (“Hor-

rible Bosses”) based this film off 
the late ‘90s television series 
starring David Hassel-
hoff. Though canceled 
after its first season, 
it became a popular 
show; even members 
of the television show 
“Friends” would watch 
the original slow-motion shot of 
beautiful people running on the 
beach. However, the popularity of 
the ‘90s show will not be shared with 
the latest version.

Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) is 

the chief lifeguard of the Baywatch 
crew, a legend and hero within the 
Emerald Bay he protects. Mitch, 
along with the rest of his gorgeous 
baywatch crew (including swimsuit 
model Kelly Rohrbach), holds tryouts 
for new recruits. Possible candidates 
including the disgraced Olympic 
swimmer Matt Brody (Efron), by-
the-book Summer Quinn (Alexandra 
Daddario, “San Andreas”) and local 
nerd Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass, 
“Loving”). 

Although Mitch’s character has an 

aura of mystery and god-like abilities, 
the majority of the characters are 
one-dimensional, and the character 
development is annoyingly predict-
able. Matt was self-serving but learns 

to work with others. Summer follows 
the rules but discovers that break-
ing them can be for the greater good. 
Ronnie, a total geek, somehow over-
comes the impossible and gets with 
a hot girl. It’s a regurgitation of the 
main storylines seen in cinema over 
and over again.

While the idea of “Baywatch” is 

comical, the delivery failed to make 
the audience laugh out loud. The only 
sound to be heard is an occasional 
small noise produced by blowing air 
out of one’s nose at something half-
way amusing. The material of the 
movie is weak, superficial and unsur-

prising. The ending was already 
known 10 minutes into the movie.

However, the film is not a 

total waste. Efron is truly a 
“blue-eyed demon” as labeled 
in the movie. He is reason 
enough to see “Baywatch.” The 
big screen was made to look at 

his countless abs and killer smile. 
Johnson, packed with even more 
muscle than Efron, is also a favor-
ite to watch. From movies like “The 
Game Plan” and “Moana,” there is 
something about his warm and 
friendly demeanor that is always 
so enjoyable to watch.

The girls, too, are absolutely 

drop-dead gorgeous, leaving you 
with a whole new definition of 
swimsuit goals. They are so per-
fect that they will probably leave 
you cringing at the site of your own 
summer body readiness. Hope-
fully, they can serve as some moti-
vation to hit the gym and skip the 
junk food.

If you like a groundbreaking, 

makes-you-ponder movie, steer far 
away from “Baywatch.” But if you 
feel like shutting off your brain for 
a few hours to watch a simple plot 
with beautiful people, then “Bay-
watch” is your summer flick.

Gethard discusses his 
success as a comedian 

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

‘The Rock’ and his crew posing 

By ELI RALLO

Daily Arts Writer

“I was 20 years old, hanging 

out in an old strip club that 
had been shut down, doing 
comedy, and Amy Poehler was 
just hanging out there every 
day. It was the most punk 
rock thing in the world,” said 
American actor and come-
dian Chris Gethard about the 
Upright Citizen’s Brigade, the 
birthplace of New York City’s 
massive comedy scene (and 
his career).

Gethard spoke on the nature 

of the beloved comedy joint and 
finding his place between its 
walls.

“I was a little self conscious 

when everyone started to blow 
up back then… but as for me, so 
far, big thumbs up,” Gethard 
said.

The hilarious New Jersey 

native had his start with his 
talk show, “The Chris Gethard 
Show,” at the Upright Citizen’s 
Brigade in 2009, after taking 
classes there since 2000. He has 
since gone on to write a book, 
become a well known stand-up 
comedian, appear on a myriad 
late night shows including “The 
Late Show with Stephen Col-
bert” and is currently traveling 
around the country to film his 
podcast, 
“Beautiful/ 
Anony-

mous,” live.

Gethard fell in love with com-

edy when he first began taking 
classes in the city during col-
lege.

“I was just this confused, sad 

kid from New Jersey that kind 
of found this place,” he said 
with a nostalgic pause upon 
being asked when he knew he 
wanted to pursue comedy as a 
career.

Despite 
consistently 
hav-

ing work in the field of comedy 
throughout his early career, he 
was continuously finding rea-
sons to underestimate himself 
until he was asked by “Saturday 
Night Live” to be a guest writer 
for a few weeks in his mid twen-
ties. The day Saturday Night 
Live comes knocking at your 

door asking for your brain, you 
kind of realize you’re just where 
you are supposed to be. 

Gethard finds solace in the 

little things; he sings praises of 
New York City, the human con-
nection, news reporters messing 
up during newscasts and never 
falling into mundane routines. 
He called New York a “beauti-
ful laboratory of comedy” and 
spoke about the nature of doing 
comedy in New York by praising 
its authenticity.

“I like to keep things ground-

ed and real. I want to live 
around real people, with real 
lives,” Gethard said.

He believes it is truly quint-

essential New York City to be 
able to perform for tourists 
from Germany, a bunch of your 
comedian friends 
and some people 
from 
suburban 

New Jersey all in 
one night.

Gethard is just 

about as real as 
they come — in 
addition 
to 
an 

infectious 
per-

sonality, 
he 
is 

well spoken in a 
casual way, con-
stantly 
littering 

his responses with jokes and 
self-deprecating digs. He wasn’t 
afraid to consider himself a 
“genuinely stressed out dude” 
and has not let his growing fan-
base and fame get to his head.

“People probably think, ‘This 

guy shouldn’t be in the enter-
tainment industry; he’s a ner-
vous guy with a giant forehead,’” 
he said. “Regular people want to 
watch TV and see a regular guy. 
I’m just a regular person trying 
to make a couple people laugh.”

And with that goal in mind, 

Gethard has been immensely 
successful. His current proj-
ect, the live filming of “Beau-
tiful/Anonymous,” has had an 
outpour of support. In the live 
performance, he takes an hour 
long phone call with an anony-
mous caller and really “sinks his 
teeth into the conversation in a 
big way.” He tweets out a phone 
number before the show and has 

been receiving over 5,000 calls 
per show. The conversations 
range from family secrets to 
shocking confessions to psycho-
logical discussions — anything 
can happen, and that spontane-
ity keeps the audience engaged.

In his conversation with the 

Daily, Gethard reflected on the 
nature of real interaction, tying 
this notion of human connection 
into his intentions with creating 
“Beautiful/ Anonymous.”

“As a society, we’re moving 

away from phone calls. I can 
remember when the kitchen 
phone would ring and you’d 
have no idea who would be on 
the other end. There are one 
billion people in this world and 
everyone has something to say,” 
Gethard said.

Everyone 

definitely 
has 

something 
to 

say, 
and 
the 

words of Chris 
Gethard should 
certainly 
not 

go 
unnoticed. 

Whether he is 
having a blast 
with 
friends 

on 
his 
talk 

show, appreci-
ating the gaps 

of silence in a live one man 
show, hitting the punch line 
in a stand-up performance or 
cracking up over a YouTube clip 
of drunk Ewoks on the “Today 
Show” humping Al Roker’s leg, 
Gethard is creating spontane-
ous humor and hilarious chaos 
in a world that is increasingly 
scary and negative.

“Just put me in a room with 

a whole bunch of people and 
give me a microphone,” he said 
when asked what he hopes to 
do more of in the future. “And 
afterwards, let me go into the 
lobby and shake their hands, 
and look each of them in the eye 
and thank them for their tre-
mendous support.” 

Gethard will be recording 

“Beautiful/Anonymous” 
live 

in Ferndale, Michigan on June 
7th at 8 p.m. The show is 18 and 
over, and tickets are available 
on his website for $25.

‘Pirates 5’ drowns 
 
 

By IAN DAVID HARRIS

Daily Arts Writer

There was a time when a 

new “Pirates of the Carib-
bean” movie was a cause for 
excitement. That time has 
long since passed. “Dead Men 
Tell No Tales,” the fifth (and 
hopefully final) entry in the 
Johnny Depp (“Mordecai”) 
led franchise is quite possibly 
the worst one yet.

Picking up approximately 

five years after the forget-
table “On Stranger Tides,” 
this new film follows Jack 
Sparrow as he joins forces 
with Henry Turner (Brenton 
Thwaites, “The Giver”) and 
Carina Smyth (Kaya Scode-
lario, “The Maze Runner”) 
to find the legendary Trident 
of Poseidon, which gives 
its wielder control over the 
seas. If this all sounds a little 
familiar, that’s because this is 
essentially the same plot that 
three of the other films have 
as well. Sword fights, chases 
and curses abound, but in 
the end it all just feels like a 
cheap knock-off of the earlier 
(and better) Pirates movies. 
The only things this film does 
well have been done better in 
previous films and so much of 
what this film does badly only 
takes the franchise lower than 
it was already.

It’s difficult to say wheth-

er or not this film is worse 

than 
the 
derided 
fourth 

one. Although that movie 
was largely meaningless in 
the overall trajectory of the 
Pirates saga, this time around 
the audience is constantly 
reminded that there are bet-
ter Pirates movies out there, 
with the presence of Orlando 
Bloom (“The Lord of the 
Rings”) and Keira Knightley 
(“The Imitation Game”) con-
tinually reminding the audi-
ence that these movies were 
actually good once. Unfortu-
nately their limited presence 
only adds to the sense that 
this is a ship 
that 
should’ve 

been 
docked 

long 
ago. 
By 

the end of the 
third film the 
character arcs 
were all played 
out, the ship-to-
ship battles had 
reached their crescendo, and 
it was time to let Jack Sparrow 
sail off into the great beyond. 
What could’ve been remem-
bered as a fun trilogy of action 
flicks has instead become one 
of the most continually disap-
pointing franchises in recent 
memory. By this point the 
series has lost almost every-
thing that once made it great. 
But by far the biggest sin of 
all is what has become of Jack 
Sparrow.

What more can be said 

about Captain Jack? What 
was once an iconic char-
acter has slowly become 
a bumbling buffoon remi-
niscent of Jar Jar Binks. In 
the first three Gore Verbin-
ski (“A Cure for Wellness”) 
directed 
films, 
Sparrow 

was witty, charming, smart 
and, yes, just a little bit 
drunk. Now the drunken-
ness is all that remains. 
Jack Sparrow does not do 
a single thing that could 
be called even semi-heroic 
in the entire runtime of 
“Dead Men Tell No Tales.” 

He barely even does 
anything useful. If he 
was taken completely 
out of the movie and 
everything 
else 
was 

the same it would prob-
ably be a more enjoyable 
film. It’s truly the death 
knell for the franchise 
when, during the emo-

tional reunion that is the 
climax of the film, it cuts 
back to Sparrow and there 
are audible groans from the 
audience. What was once 
the main draw has become 
a horrible drag on the pro-
ceedings. It’s high time for 
this franchise to be put into 
port — asking audiences 
to continue to sit through 
these things would be akin 
to asking pirates to wash 
up and brush their teeth. 
Enough already.

Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow

As foreseen by the enchant-

ing Laura Palmer, “Twin 
Peaks” is back after nearly 
25 years. Kyle MacLachlan 
(“Portlandia”) returns with 
some of the original cast: 
Sheryl Lee (“Winter’s Bone”), 
Richard Beymer (“West Side 
Story”) and Al Strobel (“Child 
of Darkness, Child of Light”) 
among many others. While 
many of the faces from 
the show have returned, 
the heart of “Twin 
Peaks” has changed, if 
only by a small margin. 
Although a triumph for 
David Lynch (“Eraser-
head”), the Showtime limited 
release differs in spirit from 
Seasons One and Two.

Season Three opens with 

a prophecy from The Giant 
delivered to Agent Cooper 
in a dream, or a space like 
the Black Lodge. The scene 
proceeds in typical “Twin 
Peaks” style — patient, eerie 
and bizarre. Their conversa-
tion, cast in black and white, 
precedes a delivery of shov-
els to Dr. Jacoby at his idyl-
lic, quiet shack in the woods. 
After these two scenes, with 
their intensity juxtaposed, 
the narrative clips to New 
York City, eventually zoom-
ing in on an empty glass box 
inside a high-rise, monitored 
consistently on all sides by 
video cameras and a watch-
man. The man and the box 
stare each other down in a 
moment of quiet tension that 
is broken by a notification to 

change the memory card on 
camera three.

Within the first 10 min-

utes, “Twin Peaks” estab-
lishes itself as a continuation 
of the narrative, but through 
different techniques. The 
original two seasons were 
firmly grounded in the fic-
tional location, with occa-
sional 
forays 
across 
the 

border to One-Eyed Jack’s. 
Season Three defies the 
constriction to the town of 

Laura 
Palmer’s 

death and flicks 
back 
and 
forth 

between storylines 
and 
timelines, 

which would be 
less disorienting if 

there weren’t so many new 
characters and facets. Per-
haps, as viewers, it may be 
necessary to trust that the 
direction will answer its own 
questions and fill in its own 
blanks, like when watching 
“Game of Thrones.” Angelo 
Badalamenti’s 
sultry 
jazz 

and musical motifs are also 
lacking, leaving the audience 
listening to the sounds of 
the moment — footsteps, an 
alarm, the scratch of a record 
player.

Most dramatically, the pal-

lette of the series has changed. 
Many scenes are cast in cool, 
dark shades, which evoke 
gloom and heaviness. Other 
brighter scenes are shown 
white, creating a mood of hos-
tility and sharpness. Howev-
er, when Lynch turns back to 
the core characters that occu-
py Twin Peaks — Cooper, his 
doppelganger, Ben and Jerry 

Horne, The Log Lady, Hawk 
and Lucy — he restores the 
rich, warm, earthy tones that 
visually defined Seasons One 
and Two.

The episode itself reaches 

two separate climaxes that at 
first seem to have nothing in 
common. The first is the grisly 
murder of the watchman and 
his daring lover, who comes to 
visit at an inopportune time. 
As they begin to have sex, a 
violent specter appears in the 
glass, bursts out of the box 
and shreds the couple’s heads. 
The second is the discovery of 
the decapitated head of Ruth 
Davenport, shot in the eye, 
and the body of an unidenti-
fied man in the bed of Ruth’s 
apartment. Lynch returns to 
the murder of a young, beau-
tiful girl as a crux for the 
narrative. While Lynch may 
have left other visual motifs 
behind, the motifs of head-
lessness or the separation 
between body and mind are 
established twice within the 
first episode.

In short, “Twin Peaks” 

stays true to Lynch — 
macabre, 
strange 
images 

and questions rather than 
answers. Episodes One and 
Two, released simultane-
ously, provide a rich, mysti-
fying experience that may 
take two or more viewings 
to fully understand. While 
die-hard fans may struggle 
adjusting to the disparities, 
the limited release is ambi-
tious, looking beyond the 
confines of its legacy and 
into the plight of FBI Special 
Agent Dale Cooper.

U-M Dearborn reveals new small business major

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

Rather than finding an area 

of specialization, students at 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn College of Business 
will have the opportunity to 
learn how to build their own 
business from the ground up 
with the new small business 

management major that will be 
introduced this upcoming fall.

The program will span a broad 

array of topics in business — 
focusing on all information a 
CEO would need to know — from 

human resource management to 
accounting.

In a press release, Karen 

Strandholm, 
the 
Strategy 

and 
Management 
Studies 

Department Chair at the COB, 
noted 
typical 
curricula 
for 

bachelor’s degrees in business 
don’t 
necessarily 
prepare 

students to establish their own 
startup.

“This 
curriculum 
is 

specifically designed for the 
small 
business 
environment, 

where workers must be flexible,” 
she said. “In a large corporation 
you can be specialized in your 
education, but that’s not really an 
option when starting or running 
a small business. We’ve also 
seen that larger employers are 
interested in graduates with this 
education because they’ll have a 
solid foundation in how business 
works, 
from 
entrepreneurial 

thinking to financial reporting.”

According to the press release, 

the college is implementing the 
major in response to popular 
demand.

Contracted by the COB, the 

Educational 
Advisory 
Board, 

which 
provides 
consulting 

services in the field of education, 
found 
regional 
employers’ 

demand 
for 
employees 
with 

small-business expertise at an 
undergraduate level increased 57 
percent just from 2014 to 2015.

In a message, Colin Meldrum, 

who recently graduated from 
the UM-Dearborn College of 
Business, said he thought in 
addition to being able to start 
your own business, expertise in 
that area could increase appeal 
to employers.

“I think it offers students the 

opportunity to gain a competitive 

advantage by having a unique 
major that lets them stand 
out from the average business 
school graduate,” he wrote. “For 
future entrepreneurs it could 
be quite beneficial to major in 
something like that. Learning 
from experienced entrepreneurs 
could help encourage graduates 
to start their own business.”

Becca Solberg, Business junior 

at the University of Michigan-
Ann Arbor, agreed, saying she 
thought Ross School of Business 
could do more to facilitate small 
business ownership.

“Ross does focus a lot on finance 

in general,” she said. “They bring 
in these huge companies for 
recruiting and stuff, and I feel 
like in my one year at Ross there 
wasn’t 
much 
encouragement 

about starting your own business, 
so maybe some workshops or 
something around that would be 

useful. I mean we are learning the 
skills that could be transferred 
over to starting your own business, 
but I would say in general there’s 
not much encouragement to make 
those strides.”

Strandholm added that even 

if one doesn’t end up starting 
their own business, the purpose 
of the major would give them 
flexibility down the road and a 
skillset that will be useful in any 
venture.

“There is something appealing 

about determining what is right 
for you and having the freedom 
to make that decision,” she said. 
“It’s also an education that you can 
use at any point in your career — 
starting out, deciding mid-career 
that you want to go out on your 
own, or after retirement. Knowing 
how to run a business is a valuable 
skillset to have.”

just a word. To me, a name is much 
more than just a name. My own 
name represents the connection I 
have to Indian culture. I can use it 
as proof that I actually am, in fact, 
half-Indian. If I were to mispro-
nounce my own name — like you 
mispronounce yours — my con-
nection to the culture I care most 
about would be severed.

It doesn’t work the same way 

for you, and that’s agonizing for 
me. You’re targeted for being too 
invested in the same community 
I’m not welcomed into. You can 
ridicule, push away or ignore the 
South Asian community and the 
consequence will not be the same 
for you as it is for me. After all is 
said and done, you can still claim 
our shared cultures, religions and 
people as your own. As your peo-
ple.

After all, you look the part.

*

So now do you see? You’re not 

inclusive of people like me. Maybe 
it’s because you don’t want me to 
reap the rewards of a culture so 
great without dealing with the 
pains of having dark skin. I’ve 
stayed up so many nights wonder-
ing what my life would be like if I 
looked darker all the time. I’m sure 
it would make all the difference.

I will never quite understand 

how you feel, because I’m not 
you. But know that you won’t ever 
quite understand how I feel, the 
way that I have to experience our 
shared community, because you’re 
not me. Maybe one day, I won’t 
need to prove myself. I won’t need 
to force my way in. When that day 
comes, I’ll stop wishing for darker 
skin and more resemblance to my 
mom, but for now, that’s all I can 
think about.

I’m not here to talk about all 

of the wonderful aspects of being 
biracial. That’s for another time. 
I’m not here to explain to you the 
entire world of a mixed kid in one 
essay. That’s impossible. I’m here 
to bring up one thing and all of its 
uncomfortable truth: the exclu-
sivity of our dearly beloved South 
Asian-American community.

*

I have white-passing privilege. I 

don’t know what it’s like to be you. 
To have dark skin. To be tokenized 
as a brown South Asian. But you 
also don’t know what it’s like to be 
me.

Everyone who knows that I’m 

biracial also knows that I care very 
much about my Indian culture. 
The reason they know is because I 
need to continuously prove to the 
South Asian community that I’m 
good enough to be allowed in.

Before you get defensive, pause 

and reflect for a moment. Are you 
actually an inclusive community? 
I’m not referring to the gatekeep-
ing that shuns non-South Asian 
people of color. I’m not really talk-
ing about the treatment of dark-
er-skinned, 
ambiguous-looking 

multiracial people. I’m asking you, 
are you actually inclusive of me 
and people who look like me, or is 
it just because I force my way in?

You think I don’t have to prove 

my worth, but that’s because I’ve 
already proved myself to you. I’ve 
passed your tests. With every new 
Desi I meet, I have to prove myself 
all over again. I have to explain my 
personal and family history just 
so they’ll stop staring at me after I 
correctly pronounce their name — 
and tell them mine.

Why do I feel this pressure? 

Well, look at me. Some of my South 
Asian friends say that my big eyes, 
round face and curly hair make 
me look “ethnic.” “Exotic.” They 
say, “oh yeah, I can tell you’re 
not white.” But no, you can’t. You 
can’t tell because anyone I meet 
who doesn’t know anything about 
me beforehand cannot tell. You 
can’t tell because all of you had 
some clue that gave me away. And 
because I look so white, I’m forced 
to care. I’m forced to prove myself.

At 
my 
dancer 
teacher’s 

Bharatanatyam recitals — which 

I’ve been going to for 15 years — I 
still get looks as I walk around in 
my kurtha pajama. It’s only after 
I let it slip that I’ve done my own 
arangetram that the looks start to 
fade.

Strangers say to me, “Oh. So 

you’re half,” as if breaking my 
identity down into fractions jus-
tifies their skepticism. It doesn’t 
make a difference that I’ve spent 
my life engrossed in Indian cul-
ture and Hinduism, because I 
look white and their opinions are 
already formed. For someone who 
gets stares that last a millisecond 
too long when I kiss my mom’s 
cheek at a puja, when I dance at a 
wedding with my little cousins… 
I can tell you, there’s a reason I’m 
calling the South Asian commu-
nity exclusive.

I could have chosen to ignore 

my Indian culture or only half-
heartedly partake in it. The irony 
is, if I acted as “white” as some of 
my South Asian friends do, I know 
I wouldn’t be accepted in the 
South Asian community at all.

Want to know what I used to do 

when I was young and still think 
about doing at 20 years old? I used 
to work in the garden with my 
mom, so I could tan and be brown 
like her. I used to wish and wish 
that I would get dark and stay dark 
throughout the year, so I could be 
brown like her. It was a contest 
between me and my sisters: who 
can look the most like Mama? 
Everyone said I had the closest 
skin. Those fleeting moments of 
happiness I get when I am com-
pared to my mom and her family 
mean so much to me.

Perhaps the most frustrating 

part of this, for me, is that I don’t 
get to represent something that 
I find so meaningful. But you — 
as South Asians who look South 
Asian — have to represent our 
shared cultures, whether you like 
it or not. You have to answer ques-
tions about cultures and religions 
you might not even subscribe to!

Every time I hear you say your 

own names incorrectly when 
introducing yourselves, I get frus-
trated. When I hear you mispro-
nounce sacred Sanskrit words, I 
feel ashamed. Logically, I know 
that there could be a dozen dif-
ferent reasons why you didn’t 
pronounce that word correctly — 
you never got the chance to learn 
the etymology, you forgot how it’s 
actually pronounced after years 
of hearing it butchered or you 
thought it was trivial. Emotion-
ally, however, I’m hurt that you 
didn’t take the chance to say it cor-
rectly. To me, it’s much more than 

How dare

Dear friend,
Today I cried in public for the 

first time in a long time. I cried 
in reaction to a performance by 
the CRLT Players from the Cen-
ter for Research on Learning and 
Teaching. I was not supposed to 
be there since they only perform 
for graduate students, faculty and 
staff. However, my participation in 
the English Department’s Diver-
sity Committee got me the invite 
so there I was. I sat next to Theresa 
Braunschneider, not knowing she 
was the associate director of CRLT 
and the coordinator of Diversity 
Initiatives Dramaturg for the CRLT 
Players. I was grateful to be able to 
discuss the performance and work 
through my emotions with Theresa 
of all people. Even so, I could not 
hold back my tears.

I cried as I watched Mariam, a 

fictional character from “A Thou-
sand Cuts,” represent my Muslim 
identity and its depth on stage. I 
watched as other fictional charac-
ters who were supposed to be her 
friends and peers make assump-
tions of her, portray their stereo-
types onto her, dismiss her and 
call her out for not being a “real 
Muslim” because she did not wear 
a hijab or fit their stereotypes of 
what it means to be Muslim or what 
Islam looks like. I watched as other 
fictional characters idly sat back 
and witnessed Mariam be labeled, 
attacked and excluded by the com-
munity. They told her not to worry 
about the election and that noth-
ing could really happen because of 
checks and balances.

Yet here we are.
I, too, was repeatedly told how 

to feel, be and handle my identity. 
After watching how Mariam was 
treated, I couldn’t help but to think 
of you, my friend. You represent 
every person who has ever claimed 
to not be racist because of their one 
ethnic friend. You represent every 
person who will hold up a poster 
that claims their solidarity to take 
a picture for the news or post it on 
social media but truly does not care 
about minority issues. Most impor-
tantly, you represent the people 
who claim to respect my identities 
and yet support the policies that 
attack my identities.

How dare you.
How dare you claim to respect 

how I feel and say you stand in 
solidarity with me yet support my 
attacker and feel nothing for how 
my identity is being attacked.

However, this is not about you 

or your fake support. This is about 
how we claim “all men were cre-
ated equal” and “thou shalt love 
thy neighbor,” yet that truly only 
applies to the dominant, white, 
Christian men and, sometimes, 
women. I have had enough of the 
fake pretenses. The very govern-
ment that is supposed to protect me 
sees me as a threat. What am I to 
do? I’ll tell you what I am not going 
to do.

I will not allow you to pretend to 

be my ally.

I will not allow you to fill me 

with dismay or make me feel like I 
am in the wrong for being upset.

I will not idly sit back while you 

disrespect me.

I will call you out and remove 

you from my life. I will forever 
stand up for what I believe in.

Jacob Shames: What happened?

BASEBALL

The longest game in Big Ten 

Tournament history — a 13-inning 
epic 
between 
Michigan 
and 

Indiana — had just concluded. The 
triumphant team entered the post-
game press conference to revisit the 
previous four hours and 28 minutes.

“We’re almost better with our backs 

against the wall,” said the player who 
had delivered the game-winning hit in 
the final frame. “We don’t give up.”

Added 
the 
winning 
coach: 

“They’re used to playing a little bit 
better when there’s pressure. And it’s 
been like that all season long.”

If one saw those quotes without 

attribution, they might immediately 
assign them to Michigan. But neither 
statement was uttered by a Wolverine.

Instead, it was Hoosier left-fielder 

Alex Krupa, and his coach, Chris 
Lemonis, recounting their team’s 
5-4 elimination-game victory, which 
knocked Michigan (42-15) out of the 
tournament after just two games.

It’s not only that the second-seeded 

Wolverines suffered two straight upset 
losses. Superior teams are sometimes 
defeated. That’s the nature of sports, 
and especially postseason play.

But Michigan was eliminated in a 

fashion few could have predicted.

The Wolverines never forgot 

their collapse at the end of last 
season which knocked them out of 
NCAA Tournament contention. In 
the offseason they went to work, 
steeling their resolve and using the 
painful memories of 2016 to forge 
the “fighter mentality” that coach 
Erik Bakich has extolled all season.

Before the season, Michigan 

believed it would have a potent 
offense and a deep pitching staff. 
Both of those assumptions turned 
out to be true, as the Wolverines 
scored more and allowed fewer runs 
than anyone else in the Big Ten. In 
terms of talent, this was the most 
complete team in the conference.

But maybe just as importantly, 

Michigan had an identity.

Mentality is, of course, impossible to 

quantify. Not even the most dedicated 
observer can say that the Wolverines’ 
success in the face of adversity has 
come solely because they are tougher or 
more motivated than their opponents.

But for 55 games, Michigan’s 

results under pressure backed up 
this idea of resiliency. Coming 
into the Big Ten Tournament, the 
Wolverines had won six games in 
the ninth inning or later, as opposed 

to just two such games a year ago.

With an emphasis on quality at-bats 

(Michigan led the Big Ten in on-base 
percentage) and two relievers in Mac 
Lozer and Jackson Lamb who had not 
given up a run in 51.1 innings, this is 
a team used to dominating in clutch 
scenarios — the same ones it faced 
against Northwestern and Indiana.

Wednesday’s Big Ten Tournament 

opener was the exact type of game 
the Wolverines pride themselves on 
their ability to win. In unpleasant, 
rainy conditions, Michigan had 
come back from an early two-run 
deficit to shut down the Wildcats 
and claw its way ahead, 4-3.

It wasn’t pretty. But this is 

postseason baseball. An ugly win is still 
a win. And it looked like the Wolverines 
were going to get one, with Lamb 
taking the mound in the ninth inning.

But to the surprise of everyone 

except for Northwestern and its 
fans, Lamb surrendered a leadoff 
single. Then a wild pitch. Then a 
single and a walk to load the bases 
with no outs. Sophomore left-hander 
William Tribucher couldn’t stop the 
bleeding, and he allowed all three 
inherited runners to score.

And down 6-4 with three outs left, 

Michigan — maybe for the first time 
all season — was without an answer.

“50-some games where we’ve been 

pretty consistent (in the ninth inning) 
so I just look at this as a fluke, just a 
speed bump,” Bakich said. “Our guys 
have responded every time they’ve 
been knocked down all season and 

they’ll respond tomorrow.”

But they didn’t.
Leading the Hoosiers 3-2 in the 

eighth inning, Lozer — who had 
given up just six hits in 23 innings — 
gave up a leadoff double. He settled 
down to record two quick outs, but 
three straight base hits delivered 
Indiana the lead.

The Wolverines staged their own 

two-out rally to send the game to extras 
in the ninth inning. But it was clear 
they had met their match in late-inning 
resiliency. The two most important 
games of their season contradicted the 
entire three months that came before.

Maybe we didn’t take all the 

variables of postseason play into 
account. Maybe we overlooked the 
fact that Michigan, despite a 16-8 
Big Ten record, was just 2-4 against 
the conference’s top six teams. 
Maybe fatigue had caught up to the 
Wolverines — Bakich explained 
that Lamb was dealing with some 
shoulder soreness Wednesday.

“He didn’t look as sharp as he 

normally is and sometimes when 
you’re a closer that’s what happens,” 
Bakich said. “If you’re a closer, some 
days you’re going to have that happen.”

That’s what happens.
Maybe you could apply that to the 

entire team.

It may not be the clearest answer. 

But the question of “what happened?” 
doesn’t call for clarity.

Indiana ousts ‘M’ from 
Big Ten tournament

As the ball wrapped around third 

base and rolled into the outfield, 
the Michigan baseball team knew 
its hopes of a Big Ten Tournament 
Championship were over. Indiana 
(33-21-2) had taken the Wolverines 
to 13 innings and brought the runner 
from second across the plate to hand 
Michigan (42-15) a 5-4 loss. 

“Heck of a college baseball game,” 

said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“Two good teams going at it. A lot 
of little plays under the microscop. 
… Both teams had opportunities 
throughout the game. Big defensive 
plays were made by both teams, big 
pitches were made by both teams, big 
hits.

“A very good baseball game and 

(I’m) disappointed we didn’t come 
out on top.”

With their ace pitcher on the 

bump, the Wolverines were primed 
to redeem themselves after an 
opening round loss to Northwestern 
the day before. Junior left-hander 
Oliver Jaskie didn’t allow a hit until 
the fourth inning. He had nine 
strikeouts through seven innings, but 
in the bottom of the seventh inning 
he allowed a two-run home run to 
Indiana centerfielder Craig Dedelow 
to tie the game. 

The home run was the first scoring 

play since the second inning, where 
the Wolverines had struck first. 
Junior first baseman Jake Bivens led 
off with a single to right-field, stole 
second and advanced to third on 
a sacrifice fly. With the first run of 
the game just 90 feet from the plate, 
sophomore Jonathan Engelmann 
blasted a single up the middle to score 
Bivens. Engelmann would later be the 
second run of the inning after senior 
centerfielder Johnny Slater ripped a 
ground rule double to centerfield. 

After 
Dedelow’s 
game-tying 

homer, Michigan had to go to work 
again. It responded right away by 
taking the lead in the top of the 
eighth inning on an Indiana error 
that allowed junior third baseman 
Drew Lugbauer to score from second. 
A groundout ended the inning and 
stranded Bivens on third base, but the 
Wolverines hoped the one-run lead 
would be enough. 

Senior right-hander Mac Lozer, 

who coming into this contest had a 
0.00 earned-run average and had 
allowed just seven hits through 
25 innings, took the mound. But 

in similar fasion as Wednesday’s 
contest, the bullpen couldn’t get the 
job done. A leadoff double to left-
center field set the Hoosiers up for a 
sacrifice bunt to advance the runner 
to third. A slow grounder to shortstop 
would score the tying run after senior 
Michael Brdar considered trying to 
make the play at the plate but went for 
the guaranteed out at first base. 

With two outs, Lozer allowed 

three consecutive singles, which 
scored another run and gave Indiana 
the lead heading into the ninth 
inning. 

However, the Hoosiers weren’t 

the only ones that could rally with 
two outs. After sophomore second 
baseman Ako Thomas was hit by a 
pitch, a Brdar single through the right 
side advanced him to second. But 
Lugbauer did the most damage with 
a single through the left side. Thomas 
scored easily, but Indiana’s left-
fielder slightly bobbled the ball which 
brought the go-ahead run to third 
base. Unfortunately for Michigan, 
a checked swing strikeout would 
strand two men on base.

Eager to end it, the Wolverines 

made some noise in the 12th inning. 
Lugbauer began the inning with a 
walk and was followed by a single. 
With two men on and no outs, 
Michigan’s chances of scoring looked 
good. But Lugbauer was caught in 
no man’s land and Indiana’s catcher 
threw him out. The play shifted the 
momentum of the inning, and the 
Wolverines went down quietly. 

In the 13th inning, it appeared 

Michigan had played out of a jam 
and would live to see another frame. 
After an overthrow by sophomore 
third baseman Jimmy Kerr and a 
four-ball walk, the Hoosiers had two 
men on with no outs. But two clutch 
strikeouts from sophomore left-
hander William Tribucher gave the 
Wolverines hope — until left-fielder 
Alex Krupa’s hit ended Michigan’s 
tournament. 

It was a strong showing by both 

teams. But in the end, the Wolverines 
couldn’t string enough hits together, 
and the 13 batters they left on base 
came back to haunt them.

“There’s no question about the 

fight and character of this group,” 
Bakich said. “If I know this group 
at all, which I do, this will piss them 
off a little bit. They wanted to be Big 
Ten Champions and we didn’t get 
that done. But they’ll get back at it 
this week, and whatever happens, 
wherever we go, we’ll be ready.”

Previewing Michigan’s opponents in the Chapel Hill Regional

JACOB SHAMES

Summer Managing Sports Editor

After its winningest regular 

season since 2008, the Michigan 
baseball team qualified for its 
second 
NCAA 
Tournament 

under coach Erik Bakich, and 
first since 2015.

This 
time, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines had to sweat things 
out. Two years ago, Michigan 
qualified for the tournament 
automatically by virtue of a 
surprise run to the Big Ten 
Tournament 
championship. 

This season, the Wolverines 
dropped both of their games at 
the conference tournament, and 
despite a 42-15 record, they made 
the NCAA Tournament as the 
last team in.

“They say that we’re the last 

team in, but we’re going to be the 
last team standing,” said senior 
right-hander Mac Lozer after 
the selection show aired Monday 
on ESPN2. “That’s the way we’re 
looking at it.”

But 
being 
the 
last 
team 

standing won’t be an easy task, 
as Michigan was placed in the 
Chapel Hill regional, hosted 
by No. 2 national seed North 
Carolina. 
The 
regional 
also 

consists of No. 2-seed Florida 
Gulf Coast of the Atlantic Sun 
and No. 4-seed Davidson of the 

Atlantic 10.

The Wolverines will meet 

the Eagles in their opener at 
1 p.m. Friday, while the Tar 
Heels and Wildcats will square 
off at 6 p.m. later that day. The 
double-elimination 
bracket 
is 

set to continue through Sunday 
and possibly Monday, and the 
winner will advance to the Super 
Regional round next week, where 
they will take on the winner of 
the Houston Regional hosted by 
Houston.

After Michigan dropped an 

extra-inning 
heartbreaker 
to 

Indiana Thursday, Bakich stated 
that the Wolverines will need to 
use their Big Ten Tournament 
performance to feed the chip on 
their shoulder in order to have a 
successful showing in the NCAA 
Tournament.

“We’ve been playing with a 

chip all along. Every step of the 
way there seems to be something 
that just makes that chip a little 
bit bigger and sharpens our edge 
a little bit more,” Bakich said. 
“Not that we need any motivation 
for the NCAA tournament, but 
it certainly provides a little bit 
more because we want to play 
well in tournament baseball.”

The Daily looks at the three 

teams Michigan may face in the 
Chapel Hill Regional:

No. 2 seed North Carolina (47-

12, 23-7 Atlantic Coast)

The Tar Heels are a traditional 

powerhouse, having appeared in 
six College World Series from 
2006 to 2013 under coach Mike 
Fox. But this year marks their 
first NCAA Tournament berth 
since 2014. North Carolina’s 
dominant pitching staff — which 
ranks fifth in the country with a 
2.96 earned-run average — is led 
by right-hander J.B. Bukauskas 
(9-0, 2.02 ERA, 111 strikeouts), 
the ACC Pitcher of the Year who 
is also projected by Baseball 
America as the sixth overall pick 
in this summer’s MLB Draft. 
Right-handers Luca Dalatri (6-3, 
3.50) and Tyler Baum (6-0, 2.65) 
round out the rotation, while 
right-hander Josh Hiatt anchors 
the bullpen with 13 saves and a 
.167 opponent’s batting average.

The Tar Heels also possess a 

deep, well-rounded lineup. Six 
players have hit at least seven 
home runs, while three players 
— shortstop Logan Warmoth, 
outfielder 
Brian 
Miller 
and 

second baseman Ashton McGee 
— bat above .340. Defensively, 
the Tar Heels are just as solid, 
ranking 21st in the country with 
a .979 fielding percentage.

North Carolina is a team with 

almost no weaknesses on the 
mound, at the plate or in the 
field. As a result, the Tar Heels 

are unquestionably one of the 
favorites to advance to Omaha 
— and possibly win the first 
national title in program history.

Florida Gulf Coast (42-18, 13-8 

ASUN)

Only a Division I program 

since 2010, the Eagles are making 
their first NCAA Tournament 
appearance in history. However, 
despite its youth as a program, 
Florida Gulf Coast proved it 
could hang with anyone this 
season — it went 2-0 against 
No. 3 national seed Florida and 
defeated then-No. 1 Florida State 
in March.

When 
they 
meet 
the 

Wolverines Friday, the Eagles 
will likely send Kutter Crawford 
to the mound. The right-hander 
is 7-1 with a 1.58 ERA and 91 
strikeouts in 79.2 innings. Right-
hander Kenton Hering (7-3, 2.04 
ERA, 75 strikeouts) has been 
FGCU’s ace reliever this season.

The Eagles’ lineup is anchored 

by ASUN Player of the Year 
Nick Rivera. After his senior 
season last year was cut short 
due to injury, the first baseman 
received a medical hardship 
waiver. Rivera has made the most 
of it, leading the Eagles with 17 
home runs and .585 slugging 
percentage. He has plenty of 
support from the rest of the 
lineup, which has eight players 

hitting at least .280, including 
shortstop Julio Gonzalez’s .337 
clip.

Davidson 
(32-24, 
13-11 

Atlantic-10)

Florida Gulf Coast isn’t the 

only team that will be making 
its NCAA Tournament debut in 
Chapel Hill. The Wildcats have 
played baseball since 1902, but 
won the most games in program 
history this season on their way 
to a long-awaited postseason 
appearance. Davidson finished 
just sixth in the A-10 regular 
season standings, but defeated 
regular 
season 
champions 

Virginia Commonwealth twice 
Sunday to claim the conference’s 
automatic bid.

For their Cinderella story to 

continue, the Wildcats will rest 
their hopes on two sluggers. 
Outfielder Will Robertson has 
hit 18 home runs on a .335 average 
while slugging .657, while first 
baseman Brian Fortier is just 
behind him with 15 home runs 
and a .318 average.

Davidson’s pitchers, however, 

have combined for a mediocre 
4.54 ERA this season, and just 
four players have an ERA below 
4. The Wildcats will look for a 
strong performance from right-
hander Durin O’Linger (8-3, 2.85 
ERA) to boost their pitching 
staff.

BASEBALL
‘M’ earns NCAA berth

JACOB SHAMES

Summer Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan baseball team is 

going dancing. 

After the Wolverines went 42-15 

during the regular season — their 
most successful regular season 
since 2008 — they were selected for 
the NCAA Tournament, receiving 
a No. 3 seed in the Chapel Hill 
regional, hosted by No. 2 national 
seed North Carolina.

Despite a top-20 ranking for 

most of the season, Michigan’s 
relatively 
low 
RPI 
(35) 
and 

strength of schedule (138), as well 
as the two losses it suffered in 
last week’s Big Ten Tournament 
caused it to remain on the bubble, 
and contributed to the Wolverines’ 
fairly low seeding relative to their 
win total — in fact, Michigan was 
the last team in the tournament, 
according to the NCAA.

Including 
the 
Wolverines, 

five Big Ten teams qualified for 
the tournament, tying a record 
set two years ago. Iowa won the 
conference’s automatic bid by 
winning the Big Ten Tournament 

Sunday, while Indiana, Nebraska 
and Maryland received at-large 
nods.

The Chapel Hill regional, 

which 
features 
a 
double-

elimination 
format, 
includes 

Michigan, 
No. 
1-seed 
North 

Carolina, No. 2-seed Florida Gulf 
Coast and No. 4-seed Davidson. 
The Wolverines will open play 
against the Eagles at 1 p.m. 
Friday.

Nationally, 
Oregon 
State, 

which held the No. 1 ranking 
for much of the season in the 
D1baseball.com poll, among other 
polls, was named the top overall 
seed. Other nationally seeded 
teams include North Carolina, 
Florida, LSU, Texas Tech, TCU, 
Louisville and Stanford.

The 
NCAA 
Tournament 

Regional round begins Thursday, 
and the regional round runs 
through 
Monday. 
Following 

regionals are the super regionals, 
hosted by the regional winners.

Minor wins National Championship

After sending a backhand 

crosscourt, 
Brienne 
Minor 

watched her opponent’s return 
sail long and she threw up her 
racket in celebration.

It had been a whirlwind week 

for the sophomore on her way 
to becoming the NCAA tennis 
singles champion.

“It feels amazing, I’m still 

soaking it all in,” Minor said in 
a press conference 
after 
the 
match. 

“When I threw my 
racket at the end of 
the match I just felt 
this wave of relief 
because I was just 
so happy I could 
get that win. I was 
super tired, so I was 
excited to let that 
racket go and just 
be done with the 
match.”

Entering 
the 
tournament 

unseeded didn’t seem to phase 
Minor. 
Once 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
team 
had 
been 

eliminated 
from 
the 
team 

competition, Minor and her 
teammate 
sophomore 
Kate 

Fahey both entered the singles 
tournament. While they both 
made historic runs — both being 
the first Wolverines to make it to 
the quarterfinals — it was Minor 

who walked away with the title. 

Her 
path 
to 
a 
national 

championship wasn’t easy. The 
24th-ranked 
sophomore 
had 

to battle passed six opponents 
— including three in the top 15 
— on her way to the title. After 
winning her first round match 
in three sets, Minor seemed 
to breeze through the rest of 
the tournament. She won four 
of the preceding five matches 
all in two sets, including the 
championship. 

The 
semifinal 

matchup 
against 

Vanderbilt’s No. 15 
Sydney Campbell 
didn’t initially go 
Minor’s way. She 
dropped the first 
set in a tiebreaker 
after rallying back 
from a 4-1 deficit, 
but stormed back 
and 
took 
the 

second set, 7-5, on 

a double fault from Campbell. 
From then on it was Minor’s 
match to win and she dominated 
the third set, 6-0. 

With a national championship 

on the line, Minor was set to 
face Florida’s No. 6 Belinda 
Woolcock. It was a surprise to 
many, herself included, that 
Minor had made it this far in the 
tournament.

The 
Gators 
had 
already 

claimed the team title and 

Woolcock seemed poised to take 
the singles crown as well. 

That’s until Minor opened the 

championship match by winning 
the first four games. 

Braced with a lead, Minor 

cruised to a 6-3 win in the first 
set, and the second set wasn’t 
much different. Woolcock kept 
the score closer in the second 
set, but Minor won a crucial 
game when she was up 4-3 to put 
her within one game of winning 
the set, as opposed to being tied 
at four. 

With Minor one game away 

from clinching the second set, 
she broke Woolcock’s serve and 
clinched a 6-3 win. 

It 
was 
a 
record-breaking 

season for Minor. Not only is 
she the first player in program 
history 
to 
win 
a 
national 

championship, 
but 
she 
also 

garnered 
her 
second 
All-

American honor and she joins 
just six other Wolverines to 
have a 30-win season.

Minor 
finished 
the 
season 

with a 32-6 record, and with a 
national championship under her 
belt and still two years remaining 
at Michigan, the future appears 
bright for the sophomore. 

“I just feel so honored to 

represent such a great school,” 
Minor said. “I love Michigan and 
I’m so glad I committed here. I 
wouldn’t want to be anywhere 
else.”
