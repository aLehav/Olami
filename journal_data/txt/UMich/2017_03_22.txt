After bringing the likes of 

Migos, J. Cole and Common 
to campus, MUSIC Matters’ 
SpringFest 
will 
be 
hosting 

headliners 2 Chainz, Lil Yachty 
and Desiigner at the Crisler 
Center for the organization’s 
largest planned concert to date.

MUSIC Matter’s sixth annual 

charity festival will take place 
on Friday, April 14 and will 
consist of a day-long festival 
with live performances from 
local and emerging talent, a 
pitch competition, food trucks 
and a closing performance at the 
Crisler Center from a headlining 
trio of 2 Chainz, Lil Yachty and 

Desiigner, with proceeds going 
toward a summer camp for 
Detroit youth to be hosted at 
the University of Michigan this 
coming summer.

Grammy-winner 2 Chainz 

will be making his second 
appearance on campus, last 
performing at Hill Auditorium 
for 
SpringFest 
in 
2014. 

Additionally, in a change from 
SpringFest’s 
usual 
single-

headliner concerts, 2 Chainz 
will also be joined by hip-hop 
artists Lil Yachty and Desiigner.

The 
two 
artists 
both 

boast meteoric rises to fame, 
immediately finding themselves 
in the public eye after breakout 
projects released early last 
year. “Broccoli,” Lil Yachty’s 

The University of Michigan 

Digital Innovation Greenhouse, 
housed within the Office of 
Academic Innovation, released 
a new version of Academic 
Reporting Tools earlier this 
week, which will make course 
evaluation data more readily 
available to students.

Mike Wojan, a DIG user-

experience 
designer 
who 

worked with students and other 
team members to design ART 
2.0, said the major difference 
between the newest version of 
ART and previous iterations 
is the inclusion of the course-
evaluation data, a decision based 
largely on student feedback. He 
said the ultimate goal of ART 
is summed up in the slogan: 
“explore, discover and decide.”

“Those are the three things 

we’re trying to help facilitate 
right now: students exploring 
their options when it’s time to 
register courses, discovering 
things they might not have 
known 
about, 
courses 
or 

instructors or topics that the 
might not have known about, 
and then making more informed 
decisions when it comes time to 
register,” he said.

Wojan explained the data 

will be represented in terms 
of a bar graph showing the 
percentage of students who 

responded to course evaluations 
questions in a certain way, like 
the percentage that “strongly 
agree.” 
These 
feature 
will 

include icons representing the 
sentiment behind each question, 
like a crystal ball to indicate 
many students agreed that they 
knew what was expected of 
them in the course.

“We had to decide how are we 

going to give this information 
back to the user,” Wojan said. 
“What is going to be the easiest 
way for students to look at 
these evals, and right away 
understand what the data’s 
actually saying about the course 
or about the instructor?”

Amy Homkes-Hayes, lead 

innovation advocate of DIG, 
said 
student 
feedback 
has 

been 
instrumental 
to 
the 

improvement of ART, and will 
be necessary for its continued 
success.

“We also have a lot of student 

support,” 
she 
said. 
“That’s 

one of the major ways that 
we’re spreading the word is 
by going through our student 
representatives to say this is a 
tool we want students to use 
while they’re engaging the 
backpacking process and for 
course selection.”

She said the decisions of 

what information from course 
evaluations 
to 
include 
in 

ART were based on criteria 
established by the Office of the 
Provost, the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs and Central Student 
Government. 
The 
groups 

agreed on including standards 

set for data shown based on 
class size, number of evaluation 
responses 
and 
number 
of 

semesters taught. In addition 
to the use of aggregate data 
and displaying the number of 
student responses compared to 
the number enrolled in the class, 
these 
parameters, 
Homkes-

Hayes explained, heighten the 
validity of the data shown.

“One of the benefits of using 

ART 2.0 is that this is official 
University data,” she said. “We 
have the blessing of all of the 
relevant parties in order to 
show it, and we also believe 
that we’re showing it in a really 
sophisticated way … that makes 
it easy to understand.”

Programs aimed at helping lower income student, such as Pell Grants, to decrease

President Donald Trump’s budget 

proposal suggests downsizing the 
Department of Education by 13 
percent, or $9 billion, and eliminates 
multiple grants, including Pell 
Grants and other programs aimed 

at helping low-income students.

The proposed budget reduces or 

eliminates funding for more than 20 
departmental programs, including 
removing $2.4 billion in grants for 
teacher training and $1.2 billion in 
funding for after-school programs. 
At a rally in Tennessee, Trump said 
this budget will be more efficient, 
cutting programs on the basis of 

redundancy.

“(The budget will lower) costs 

to the taxpayer by reducing or 
eliminating funding for programs 
that are not effective, that duplicate 
other efforts or that do not serve 
national needs,” Trump said at the 
rally.

Secretary of Education Betsy 

DeVos agreed, promising the most 

“vulnerable” 
students 
will 
be 

protected despite the large cuts 
being made.

“This budget maintains our 

department’s focus on supporting 
states and school districts with 
the goal of providing an equal 
opportunity for a quality education 
to all students,” DeVos said at a

Jim Harbaugh, head 

coach of the University of 

Michigan football team, 

recently played himself in a 

Planters commercial, where he 

embraces his persona on the 

football field in its “Shout for 

Nuts” promotion.

The 15-second commercial 

premiered Tuesday and 

features Harbaugh standing at 

a Planters vending machine in 

the middle of a mall. Harbaugh 

yells, “I love peanuts,” at the 

vending machine, and, after 

not receiving any, throws his 

hat on the ground.

Harbaugh took to Twitter 

after formally meeting Mr. 

Peanut, calling him a “heck of 

a good Peanut” and a fan of the 

University of Michigan.

To get peanuts from the 

machine, Harbaugh said you 

need to reach a high enough 

decibel of noise to trigger their 

release.

“It was shouting into a 

machine and you had to get the 

decibel level high enough to 

get the can of peanuts to come 

out,” Harbaugh told Sporting 

News.

Harbaugh said he was 

incentivized during the 

commercial.

“I was highly motivated,” 

Harbaugh also told Sporting 

News. “I like to eat peanuts 

as I said. I told my dad I was 

coming out here to do this, and 

he was expecting a year-long 

supply of peanuts, so I had to 

do good.”

A new resolution aiming to 

expand access of Medicaid benefits 
to the University Health System 
services took the Central Student 
Government floor at Tuesday 
night’s meeting.

The resolution asks UHS to 

absorb the fees currently being 
charged to students and their 
dependents who receive standard 
Medicaid benefits. This would 
be during the period of time the 
University of Michigan applies for 
a waiver to the state of Michigan 
to service just University students 
who receive Medicaid and not the 
greater Washtenaw area, which 
current provision of Medicaid 
enforces.

Social Work senior Brittney 

Williams, the author of the 
resolution 
and 
an 
assembly 

member who currently receives 

Medicaid benefits, shared with the 
committee the extensive duration 
of time the University has taken 
to obtain the waiver to service just 
University students.

“They know what’s going on, 

they just refuse to do this efficient 
work to get it done,” Williams said, 
visibly becoming emotional at the 
meeting. “You can go to UHS if 
your leg is broken, but you can’t get 
crutches if you have Medicaid.”

Rep. Sheema Rehman, an LSA 

senior, agreed, stating students 
needed to have their needs 
addressed.

“This is a concern that has 

been going on for a very long 
time at the University,” Rehman 
said. “UHS has done its best in 
the time being, but at the same 
time, the fact of the matter is 
students at this university pay 
part of their tuition to go to UHS 
and so, by virtue, being a student, 
fundamentally, we should have 
access to the University’s health 

service.”

Rehman also iterated the 

significant amount of funds 
allocated 
through 
tuition 

that go toward paying for the 
services by UHS. She stressed 
the relevance of the University’s 
recent diversity initiatives to 
be more inclusive, stating this 
resolution directly relates to its 
purpose and goals.

“If we’re really going to an 

inclusive university and go 
beyond just talking about DEI 
the way that you are inclusive 
to all students is recognizing 
this concern by a small number 
and even if it’s one person it 
shouldn’t 
matter,” 
Rehman 

said.

Under the health-service fee 

included in student’s tuition, 
services such as contraceptive 
devices and standard medical 
equipment are not covered 
and require medical insurance 
for 
coverage. 
Currently, 

UHS services a variety of 
health-care providers such 
as 
expansive 
Medicaid 

and 
Medicare 
but 
does 

not service the standard 
Medicaid insurance.

Funding for waivers will 

aim to be provided in part by 
the DEI initiative as well as 
Student Life funds.

The resolution to support 

the plan was passed 35-1, 
with one abstaining.

Another resolution was 

tabled 
regarding 
current 

student concerns about the 
funding of the Leadership 
Engagement Scholarship.

The scholarship aims to 

reduce the costs and barriers 
students with “demonstrated 
need” currently face and that 
prevent them from being 
involved in extracurricular 
activities. The scholarship 
would allow them to lead 
and join their respective 
student organizations.

conference in Washington D.C. on 
Feb. 14. 

Still, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Mich.), the former chair of the 
Wayne State University Board of 
Governors, said in a statement that 
despite claims some education 
programs are duplicative, many 
students still rely on them.

“President Trump’s proposed 

budget 
would 
put 
education 

even further out of reach for 
families by cutting or eliminating 
vital 
programs 
students 
rely 

on to help fund their college 
education, 
including 
cutting 

federal work-study programs and 
ending Supplemental Education 
Opportunity Grants, which more 
than 52,000 students in Michigan 
received last year.” 

Low-income 
students 
are 

expected to be most affected. The 
Federal Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grant program, which 
provides need-based aid to 1.6 
million undergraduates a year, is 
slated to be eliminated.

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of the College Republicans, 
said he does not see this as a loss, 
however, considering the criticism 
the program has received for being 
inefficient.

“A large portion of this budget 

cut comes from the reduction 
of the Supplemental Education 
Opportunity Grant; an outdated 
program that gives money directly 
to colleges as opposed to low-
income students.”

Additionally, 
the 
Trump 

administration plans to reduce the 
work-study program “significantly,” 
though it doesn’t detail how much it 
would be reduced. Currently, the 
program spends about $1 billion to 
provide more than 600,000 college 
students with jobs pertinent to their 
studies, according to the National 
Association 
for 
Financial 
Aid 

Administrators.

Though the work-study program 

has received bipartisan support 
for providing a job rather than a 
handout, it has been criticized for 
providing too much for the affluent 
and not enough for low-income 
families. The structure of the work-
study program allocates money 
toward colleges and universities 
that have been in the program for 
a longer time; historically, those 
colleges and universities are more 
expensive 
and 
have 
wealthier 

students.

Additionally, 
Zalamea 
said 

the work-study is not effective at 
creating opportunities for those 
who would not have otherwise had 
them.

“Another large portion of the 

cuts come from reducing the 
federal 
work-study 
program, 

which actually demonstrates a 
high participation rate from people 
who would have worked regardless 
of the program, or from wealthy 
students,” he said.

TRIO programs, which are 

geared toward low-income, first-
generation and disabled students, 
and GEAR UP face nearly $200 
million in funding cuts. The 
University has been criticized for 
its lack of socioeconomic diversity 
and Public Policy junior Rowan 
Conybeare, chair of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, said 
the University’s diversity will be 

further hindered without these 
programs.

“Low-income, 
first-generation 

and 
disabled 
students 
are 

unfortunately few and far between 
at UM,” Conybeare said. “Cuts to 
TRIO programs will only augment 
this issue.”

These cuts allow for the $1.4 

billion expansion in voucher 
and private school programs, a 
favorite cause of DeVos. The $1.4 
billion acts as a down payment 
to the eventual allocation of $20 
billion toward voucher programs. 
If enacted, the $20 billion would 
represent one-third of federal 
education spending.

Despite DeVos’s claims that 

school of choice will give students 
more 
academic 
opportunities, 

Conybeare argued draining money 
from the public-school system is 
counterintuitive to that goal.

“Many 
students 
use 
school 

of choice as a means to seek out 
better 
academic 
opportunities,” 

Conybeare said. “If the Department 
of Education focused instead on 
funding and fixing our public-
school system, there would be less 
of a need for the School of Choice 
program in the first place.”

However, Zalamea said school 

of choice will keep socioeconomic 
status from correlating with poor 
education.

“It’s sad to think that in the land of 

the free, your ZIP code determines 
your quality of education,” Zalamea 
said. “Undoubtedly, low-income 
families will benefit more from 
school choice than they will under 
our current, incredibly flawed 
public education system.”

partnership 
with 
MUSIC 

Matters also marks the label’s 

first 
foray 
into 
newfound 

campus-centric 
initiatives, 

according 
to 
a 
statement 

released by MUSIC Matters.

Per the release, starting this 

year, UMG plans on hosting 
campus festivals nationwide, 
modeling 
them 
after 

SpringFest’s format. In the 
statement, LSA senior Austin 
Dixon, 
talent 
and 
concert 

chair of MUSIC Matters, notes 
the partnership has made it 
possible for the Crisler Center 
to host its first concert since 
2002.

“I think 2 Chainz, Lil Yachty, 

and Desiigner all bring an 
energy that will really excite 
the student body, so to be able 
to give that experience to our 
fellow classmates and peers is 
truly incredible,” Dixon said.

Unlike past events, MUSIC 

Matter’s 
latest 
SpringFest 

concert also marks a notable 
shift from its usual venue of 
choice. Unlike Hill Auditorium, 
which has a seating capacity of 
3,500, the Crisler Center boasts 
an ability to host up to 12,707 

people; additionally, this year’s 
SpringFest concert will be the 
Crisler Center’s first student-
produced concert since 1994. In 
the statement, MUSIC Matters’ 
president Max Fisher, an LSA 
senior, said the audacious acts 
and change in scale illustrates 
the organization’s intent to 
build 
on 
its 
long-standing 

ambition.

“SpringFest is an incredible 

vehicle that unites campus 
through one event, combining 
the passion and energy of 
Michigan students with the 
academic and entrepreneurial 
spirit of the University,” the 
statement reads. “We are all 
ecstatic about the growth and 
magnitude of our festival year 
after year.” 

Tickets to the performance 

will start at $19.99 for students 
with valid UM IDs and $29.99 
for the public. Tickets will be 
available both online on the 
official MUSIC Matters website 
and at the Michigan Union Ticket 
Office beginning Thursday at 12 
p.m. and 10 a.m., respectively.

and astronomy and the faculty 
lead of ART 2.0, acknowledged 
concerns about the validity of 
data, specifically noting the 
possibility of biased student 
evaluations. However, he feels 
University data will be more 
objective than other sources 
online.

“There are always concerns 

when dealing with quantitative 
data,” he wrote. “Some faculty 
are concerned about potential 
biases in the student evaluations 
of teaching that could put 
certain faculty members at risk. 
Previous research has indicated 
that such biases are moderate 
at Michigan, and the common 
alternative, RateMyProfessor, 
is likely to be more biased than 
our own data, so the previous 
Provost 
decided 
that, 
on 

balance, the benefits of sharing 
(student evaluations) broadly 
outweigh this particular risk. 
But this is a concern that we 
need to study more closely 
and have more conversations 
around as we go forward.”

Evrard wrote he believes 

the expansion of ART will 
ultimately be beneficial for 
faculty members in that it may 
eventually 
allow 
professors 

the opportunity to include 
teaching 
statements 
and 

accomplishments in profiles on 
these pages.

“Instructors 
now 
know 

that there is a page for each 
of them that describes their 
teaching 
history 
at 
the 

university,” he wrote. “Making 
this 
information 
public 
is 

consistent with the open nature 
of our public institution, and 
I do hope that these pages 
will grow to contain more 
information 
about 
faculty’s 

teaching 
philosophies 
and 

accomplishments. … Also, some 
faculty are very innovative in 
their teaching - perhaps by 
inventing new courses to fill 
an emerging need - and these 
pages offer a potential means to 
highlight such innovations.”

Evrard hopes, in addition 

to other benefits for students 
registering for classes, ART 
will encourage students to fill 
out course evaluations more 
thoughtfully.

“An additional area of impact 

is the Student Evaluations of 
Teaching (SETs) themselves,” 
he wrote. “As students realize 
that their collective feedback 
on teaching will be shared with 
other students, we anticipate 
higher 
response 
rates 
and 

increasingly 
thoughtful 

responses 
to 
SET 
survey 

questions. 
This 
is 
where 

coordination 
with 
student 

government is essential.”

Wojan 
emphasized 
the 

importance of student feedback 
concerning ART to optimize its 
usefulness to students, not only 
in surveys, but also throughout 
the design process.

“It’s 
important 
for 
me 

to remember that I have to 
design things not just in my 
own head but something that’s 
representative of what the 
end users are asking for,” he 
said. “So (student input) is a 
good way of keeping us honest 
making sure that we have the 
right ideas about what people 
are asking for.”

LSA senior Noah Betman, 

CSG chief of staff, acted as a 
liaison between CSG and DIG 
throughout the development 
of ART, which he said was a 
productive experience. 

“I felt like my voice has been 

heard in the room, so it’s not 
just a token student voice kind 
of situation,” he said. “I’ve been 
able to provide a lot of good 
input, and the product that is 
being released … is something 
that students will appreciate 
and that will find beneficial.”

Betman said he feels ART 

will be a useful tool for students 
in the future, in terms of 
giving them information about 
workload and past students’ 
experiences.

“Having that out there when 

creating your own schedule 
and making sure that the 
balance in the best way for you 
understanding that you know if 
a course has a heavier workload 
than another course matters a 
lot to students,” he said.

Wojan said DIG will continue 

improving and adding features, 
and mentioned the possibility 
of allowing students to craft 
personal profiles on ART or see 
grade distributions.

“Moving 
forward 
we’re 

trying 
to 
do 
even 
more 

with 
ART, 
we’re 
trying 

to get students even more 
personalized 
and 
engaging 

experience on the platform,” 
he said. “Our goal for ART 
is to have some new really 
useful 
functionality 
each 

term. And so you know we’re 
excited about that and it keeps 
us on our toes because you 
know we’re always designing 
something new and exciting 
that’s going to be going out you 
can see right away.”

capsule. 
Forty 
students 
are 

working on M-BARC, while 
about 100 are coordinating and 
conducting interviews.

“(The 
time 
capsule 
will) 

showcase how far the University 
has come in the past 200 years,” 
Sethi said. “(It will) leave a lasting 
legacy of who we, members 
of the University of Michigan 
community, are now for 100 years 
down the road.”

M-BARC 
project 
lead 

Hashmita Koka, a Rackham 
student in aerospace engineering, 
said the time capsule will store 
1,000 interviews from students, 
faculty and alumni etched onto 
silicon wafers. Koka was also one 
of the first students to work on 
the project when it began.

Koka said she believes once 

all the interviews are completed, 
many different people with ties 
to the University from around 
the world will be interconnected 
through the time capsule.

“I think one of the big things 

is bringing so many people, like 
alumni from all over the world,” 
Koka said. “In a hundred years, 
we’ll have people from all over 
the world that might have some 
kind of connection to it.”

Sethi said her favorite part 

about 
collecting 
interviews 

is listening to people’s stories 
and their memories from the 
University.

“It is so interesting to go 

through life thinking one thing 
but have that be completely 
changed when I am hearing 
these interviews,” she said. “I 
have had Michigan alumni — the 
oldest being 97 — email me to ask 
to be interviewed. They have told 
me stories about being the first 
female in the marching band to 
the panty raids that used to occur 
back in the day.”

In addition to M-BARC, 

the Department of American 
Culture offered a class this 
semester designed to generate 
material for the time capsule. 
LSA senior Julia Smith, who 
is enrolled in the class, said 
her project aims to create a 
narrative of collective identity 
from narratives of individual 
student experience.

“The best way to describe 

my 
particular 
project 
for 

the time capsule is to call 
it a collective diary,” Smith 
said. “The project depends on 
student submissions, in which 
each student writes about their 
typical day at Michigan and 
then splits this day into sections 
based on the progression of a 
regular day.”

Smith said her final project 

will be a book putting all of 
the days together in a format 
that allows a “typical” day at 
Michigan to be read in multiple 
ways, or to piece together parts 
of different students’ days to 
make a complete day.

“The end goal is to represent 

as 
many 
student 
voices 

as possible, and to get the 
campus community thinking 

about individual identity and 
the ways in which it is both 
recognized 
and 
dismissed 

by 
our 
collective 
identity 

as 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students,” she said.

Koka said the time capsule 

will have a tracking system 
installed on it to monitor its 
location. After 100 years, Koka 
said, there is no formal plan yet 
in place to send it back to Earth.

“We’re 
going 
to 
have 

electronics to be able to 
communicate with it and 
maneuver it to get to the 
right orbit,” Koka said. “The 
tracking 
system 
is 
really 

important because we want 
to track it for a hundred 
years. The hope is that if we 
keep tracking it, a team of 
students a hundred years 
from now will design a 
mission to retrieve it.”

In 
addition 
to 
the 

interviews and humanities 
project, the capsule will host 
a DNA experiment testing the 
effects of radiation in space.

“We’re basically encoding 

the University of Michigan’s 
admission 
statement 
into 

synthetic DNA,” Koka said. 
“We want to test the viability 
of DNA as a storage method 
in space, because we want to 
study the effects of radiation 
in space.”

Sethi 
said 
this 
is 

unprecedented work and will 
push the limits of science.

several 
publications 
including 

The Wall Street Journal, the Los 
Angeles Times, and The New 
Yorker.

Kotlowitz 
described 
the 

importance of studying U.S. cities 
in order to understand American 
society as a whole, discussing 
specifically his study of Chicago 
and the growing inequalities 
within it.

“If you’re willing to look for 

the fissures in the American 
landscape, you’re going to find 
them within the confines of that 
city,” Kotlowitz said. “For me, 
what’s notable about Chicago, and 
now very many other cities, is that 
it’s very much a tale of two cities.”

In 
Chicago, 
certain 

neighborhoods 
have 
grown 

“miraculously” 
according 
to 

Kotlowitz, while the south and 
west sides have not grown at all, 
and instead have gotten worse.

Desmond agreed inequality in 

U.S. cities and around the world 
was striking.

“What concerns me (about 

cities) is how unlivable they’re 
becoming,” Desmond said. “So 

in New York and San Francisco 
and Boston, for example, rent 
costs more than the average 
household income. So the cities 
where the best jobs are, and the 
most opportunities are, are out 
of reach even for the middle class 
now.”

Esi Hutchful, a Public Policy 

graduate student, later echoed 
Desmond’s 
concern 
for 
the 

affordability of cities, as well as 
his call for an increase in existing 
policies 
that 
address 
these 

problems. When asked which 
policies she believed required 
more 
attention, 
she 
brought 

up the need to address racial 
residential segregation in the 
United States.

“We’ve seen in the literature 

and from decades of advocacy that 
residential racial segregation is a 
persistent problem that has never 
been truly dismantled; as we talk 
about better housing policy, we 
should not adopt a supposedly 
race-blind lens or only talk about 
race-blind economic integration,” 
Hutchful wrote in an email.

Afton Branche, a Public Policy 

graduate student, said she felt 
it was important to seriously 
consider more policies of rent 
control and rent ceilings in the 
private market.

However, in the transition 

from identifying a problem to 
calling for a solution, Desmond 
and Kotlowitz both emphasized 
the 
need 
to 
humanize 
the 

marginalized 
communities 

portrayed 
in 
their 
works, 

thus 
showing 
their 
readers 

perspectives with which they 
may be unfamiliar.

“One of the things you have 

to be careful about, especially 
writing about people who are 
really at the bottom, who are 
really marginalized, is not just 
writing 
about 
them 
because 

you want to teach a lesson, but 
rather to write about them with 
a sense of discovery,” Kotlowitz 
said, praising Desmond’s book 
for telling the stories of people in 
dire situations while capturing 
the complexities and nuances of 
their lives.

Desmond agreed humanizing 

the people portrayed in their 
works was essential. He stressed 
that portraying real people was 
an enormous responsibility. He 
mentioned how he was often 
concerned the stories he told would 
be interpreted as moral failings 
on the part of their subjects,

an you put a value on a 
human life? You probably 
don’t know the answer 

to that, and neither do I. Yet, our 
policies and our politics 
continue to reflect an 
unintentional 
answer 

to that question: Yes, 
we can. The latest effort 
of 
conservatives 
in 

Washington has been 
to dismantle former 
President 
Barack 

Obama’s 
health-care 

law, the Affordable Care 
Act — legislation that 
aimed to promote good 
health for all Americans, not only 
some. Conservatives’ long-awaited 
replacement to one of Obama’s 
trademark pieces of legislation has, 
finally, come to fruition. Kind of. 

Two 
weeks 
ago, 
House 

Republicans 
announced 
their 

proposed plans to replace the ACA 
with the American Health Care Act. 
Yet, unsurprisingly, the plan was 
met with disdain from Democrats 
as well as hesitation from moderate 
Republicans. Keeping up with their 
historical opposition to Obamacare 
and now, with the new president’s 
concerted effort to take two steps 
backward from the progress of the 
past eight years, the GOP is taking 
U.S. health care in a new direction. 
A direction where subjective 
politics is outweighing objective 
health equity.

Under the AHCA, the budget 

office predicts a rise in premiums in 
the coming years and estimates that 
52 million Americans will become 
uninsured by 2026. While saving 
$337 million, and subsequently 
going along with conservative aims 
to limit big government, the new 
plan, if passed, would be a blow to 
improving health equity across the 
country. In contrast, its predecessor 
reduced the number of uninsured 
Americans and was the beginning 
effort to close the health gap.

Further, the proposed plan, 

approved by the House Budget 
Committee, takes a toll on poorer 
Americans, as the expansion of 
Medicaid in states is predicted to 
decrease. At the same time, older 
Americans will be at risk. New 
provisions of the replacement 
would allow insurers to “charge 
older adults five times more than 
the young.” Without a doubt, the 
proposed GOP replacement works 
against the ideal of making health a 
right, not a privilege, an ideal much 
of Washington has yet to embrace.

Republicans got really good at 

preaching 
“repeal” 
throughout 

the Obama administration, but 
their efforts to produce a good 
replacement are thoroughly lacking. 
Further, the new AHCA breaks a 

promise Mr. Trump 
made just two months 
ago, 
“We’re 
going 

to 
have 
insurance 

for 
everybody.” 

Unfortunately, 
that 

doesn’t seem like the 
case.

The 
politics 

surrounding 
the 
health-care 

debate seem to be 
overshadowing what’s 

truly at risk: the well-being of 
Americans. House Republicans, 
unsurprisingly, are jumping at the 
chance to get rid of the dreaded 
ACA, but their efforts to re-align 
political power has the potential 
to take a devastating toll on 
Americans across the country. 
It begs the question: Is the new 
law being driven by pure politics, 
or by the millions of Americans 
who depend on government aid 
for a healthy life in mind? The 
entrenched political polarization 
when it comes to health care has 
effects that go beyond the walls 
of Congress; it is affecting real 
Americans who need real insurance.

This isn’t to say that all 

Republicans 
are 
backing 
the 

new replacement. In fact, four 
Republican 
governors 
recently 

spoke out against the proposal, 
highlighting the flaws of the AHCA 
when it comes to taking care of 
lower-income Americans. But, even 
more telling is the opposition by 
the American Medical Association. 
Last week, members of the group 
sent letters to the House about 
their concerns when it came to 
providing affordable coverage to 
low- and middle-income Americans. 
Maybe, instead of leaving it up to 
officials in Washington and the 
divisive politics of it all, health 
policy should take into account 
the medical professionals and 
experts whose daily lives revolve 
around the health of Americans.

There is no question that health 

care contributes to a healthy 
population and, even more, a 
productive population. The ACA 
was a measure that, as its name 
states, accounted for those who 
could not afford health insurance, 
and thus could not afford to take care 
of themselves and their families 
when sickness or injury arose. 
However, while the ACA targeted 
those who needed coverage the 
most, the new health-care act is 

backtracking. Instead, the AHCA 
has the potential to make insurance 
unaffordable for millions.

Unlike 
Obamacare, 
the 

replacement no longer requires 
every 
American 
to 
become 

insured. Instead, it approaches 
health care with an age-rating 
structure. This ultimately takes a 
toll on the poor, sick and elderly, 
as The Atlantic explains. But, 
younger and therefore typically 
healthier Americans will be paying 
lower premiums while the elderly 
will be paying more. That doesn’t 
sound too bad for a post-grad who 
will no longer be covered under 
their parents’ insurance plan at 26. 
However, when it boils down, the 
irrefutable problem in the AHCA 
remains: Those who need health 
care the most are those who will be 
facing the most obstacles to get it.

While the ACA was a step 

forward in altering the way we 
think about health in America, 
it still did not fully embrace the 
concept of health as a basic right. 
Now, the proposed replacement 
has thrown this idea out the 
window. 
By 
making 
health 

care more expensive and thus 
available to only those with the 
economic resources to afford it, 
we are valuing the health and 
well-being of some Americans 
over others. What’s more, we’re 
not supporting the well-being of 
those who need it the most. Low-
income and impoverished areas 
are more susceptible to lower 
life-expectancy than the rich, and 
without affordable measures to 
prevent disease and injury, the 
disparity between health outcomes 
will continue to increase. By letting 
economic circumstances be the 
dividing barrier between those 
who have health services and those 
who do not, we are placing more 
value on some lives than others.

The way we talk about health 

care right now is ridden with 
politics. Yes, politics play a key role 
in developing effective policy and 
law. But issues of basic rights, like 
the opportunity for a healthy life, 
go beyond the liberal-conservative 
debate. 
More 
importantly, 

these rights are something that 
everyone, regardless of party 
and age, must fight to ensure and 
preserve. The idea of taking care 
of our own seems lost these days 
and the AHCA seems like yet 
another step away from a more 
empathetic America.

nternational Women’s Day 
this year was arguably the 
most notable since the day’s 

founding. As many people take 
the time this month 
to reflect on the work 
women have done to 
improve society and 
their place in it, it is 
impossible to ignore 
how much is left for 
women to accomplish. 
The protests on March 
8 are a reminder that 
women will not rest 
until they are heard. 

But watching “Full 

Frontal With Samantha Bee” forced 
me to take a critical look at what 
Bee and many others refer to as 
“the resistance” — the people who 
demonstrate and speak out against 
Donald Trump and his policies. The 
fact that millions of people marched 
during the Women’s March and 
many women participated in “A 
Day Without a Woman” is great. It 
is important that those against the 
Trump administration, especially 
those belonging to marginalized 
groups like women, come together 
and speak out. But showing solidarity 
and marching are not the only things 
that need to be done.

What do these strikes and 

marches mean if we don’t vote? My 
hope is that following these there 
will be an increase in voter turnout 
for local elections, but unfortunately 
this has not been the case so far. It 
doesn’t make sense that roughly 
half a million to three-quarters of 
a million people marched during 
the Women’s March but there was 
only about 12-percent turnout for 
the Los Angeles mayoral election. 
The lesson we all should have taken 
away from the presidential election 
is that for change to happen, we 
need to use all of the tools that are 
available to us. So if we’re going to 
strike and march, we also need to 
vote, write to our representatives and 
take it upon ourselves to organize 

grassroots movements within our 
communities.

We also need to make sure 

that everyone has a voice in this 

movement. 
It 
needs 

to 
encompass 
all 

backgrounds. 
This 

is where I think the 
recent strike, “A Day 
Without a Woman,” 
fell short. There were 
three main points to 
this protest: Women 
were 
encouraged 

to take the day off 
work (“from paid and 
unpaid labor”), avoid 

shopping (unless it was to purchase 
something from a small women- or 
minority-owned business) and wear 
red to show solidarity.

Mobilizing people is great, 

but for many low-income people, 
taking part in this strike was not 
possible. Taking off a day of work 
literally costs these women. The 
organizers of the strike noted 
this and stated they “strike for 
them.” But instead of striking or 
protesting for them, organizers 
of all modes of resistance need 
to bring people who are most 
marginalized into the discussion. 
In addition to the protests and 
strikes, we need to simultaneously 
speak with our representatives, 
vote in local elections and work to 
ensure that every woman’s voice 
is heard, not just those who can 
afford to take off of work.

The answer to what happens 

next rests on the shoulders of 
every woman and supporter of 
the resistance. It is not enough 
to march once or post a status on 
Facebook to show support. To keep 
the momentum going, supporters 
need to be more engaged in what’s 
going on in their communities 
and how they can effect change 
where it affects the most. Each 
community is different and while 
many women across communities 
face issues that are similar, it is 

important to address issues unique 
to different communities.

Protesting is pivotal, but it is 

not just in the form of marches 
or wearing red to show solidarity. 
And when you think about 
it, what becomes of all of the 
marches and strikes if those same 
people do not show up to vote 
or do nothing to support their 
community? Nothing.

So in addition to striking or 

marching, people who support the 
movement need to go a few steps 
further. Thankfully, there are many 
ways to do this: If you can, go to 
a concert that will donate profits 
to Planned Parenthood or donate 
yourself to organizations like the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
Learn about ballot proposals and 
local elections in your area. If you’re 
staying in Ann Arbor this summer, 
make sure you’re registered to 
vote for the upcoming City Council 
primary. Also, stay informed about 
all facets of the political system. 
Don’t just focus on the latest crazy 
thing that Trump has said, like the 
“wiretapping.” Pay attention to the 
real stuff — like the fact that Trump 
plans to reduce funds for the Pell 
Grant program and eliminate the 
National Endowment for the Arts, 
the National Endowment for the 
Humanities and the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting. These 
proposed cuts, and many others, 
will affect every community, and 
the University of Michigan is no 
exception.

To effectively resist, we need 

to stay informed and use our 
energy 
to 
vote 
and 
organize 

within our communities. By doing 
this, hopefully Trump and other 
lawmakers will think twice before 
proposing legislation. They’ll learn 
that resistance is not just a word that 
follows a hashtag but something not 
to be messed with.

March 21. Naturally, 
polarization 
quickly 

ensued 
between 

Movement’s 
fandom 

and 
those 
calling 

the party out for its problematic 
campaign. Though polarization 
can be harmful, it’s important to 
recognize the need for hard-line 
stances when issues like populism 
are on the come-up. To be clear, 
the 
issues 
with 
Movement’s 

campaign aren’t about political 
leanings and policies, but with 
the sheer implementation of the 
same practices that we saw in 
President Donald Trump’s 2016 
campaign.

If you need one singular 

piece of evidence showing the 
similarities between Movement’s 
presidential nominee Evan Rosen 
and President Trump, here it is: 
“I don’t think they’re hearing 
this, I can rock the mike with no 
CSG experience.” Rosen thinks 
it’s cool or appealing to run for 
office without being experienced, 
but the crucial lesson to learn 
from the first few months of 
President Trump’s presidency 
is that being unqualified isn’t 
the best kind of qualification. 
Being cool doesn’t mean you’re 
good at understanding policy 
and representation. Just ask the 
“Trump Regretters” who wish 
they hadn’t elected the star of “The 
Apprentice” to the highest office.

Glancing through Movement’s 

Facebook 
album, 
“Meet 
the 

Squad,” anyone can see the next 
problem with the party. Out of 
22 featured squad members, 
which I guess are candidates, 14 
are white males. Out of the eight 
non-white males in the Squad, 
five are white females, three are 
men of color and zero are women 
of color. The lack of diversity 
among 
the 
party 
members, 

some of whom have titles such 
as “Official DJ” and “Illuminati 
Relations Chair,” is a strong 
indicator that Movement cannot 
represent 
the 
student 
body. 

What’s worse is that the party’s 
platform, which identifies that 
we need to “Ensure our campus is 
a welcoming community for all,” 
is hypocritical when compared to 
their candidates.

Further damaging to the party’s 

claims of diversity and inclusion 
is the fact that the only women 

featured in Movement’s entrancing 
music video fawned over the 
wannabe CSG president. As if 
the lack of women representation 

among the candidates 
— especially women 
of color — wasn’t bad 
enough, 
Movement’s 

video 
objectifies 

women in a way that 
is eerily nostalgic of 
President Trump. This 
kind of objectification 
does not belong in 
office and does not 
deserve 
the 
vote 

of 
fair-minded 

students. Instead, we should be 
championing 
underrepresented 

leaders on campus to work toward 
positive change.

Shortly after the recent CSG 

debate, hosted by The Michigan 
Daily, candidate Rosen answered 
a few questions that the Editorial 
Board had about the party’s lack of 
diversity. He responded by saying 
that although he tried to reach out to 
as many people as possible to recruit 
for his party, those who responded 
were largely homogeneous. Despite 
this homogeneity, he vowed to 
increase 
diversity 
through 
the 

assembly 
and 
cabinet. 
Rosen 

hypocritically 
thinks 
that 
his 

inability to form a diverse party 
before the elections will magically be 
reversed once in office.

Don’t get me wrong. I would 

never 
argue 
that 
someone’s 

demographics demonstrate their 
capabilities. Nor do I think anyone 
in Movement has anything but 
the best of intentions. However, 
when attempting to represent 
students, many of whom feel 
unsafe, it’s necessary to have a mix 
of diversity and allyship. When 
students called out Movement’s 
music 
video 
for 
female 

objectification and Black culture 
appropriation, 
Rosen’s 
initial 

responses were dismissive and 
deplorable. “We just made a rap,” 
he said, completely ignoring the 
concerns raised by a University 
alum. 
When 
challenged 
for 

obnoxiously claiming to be the 
“white 
George 
Washington 

Carver,” 
his 
response 
was, 

“I’m an innovator.” Even when 
opportunities to be an ally are 
handed to Rosen, he dismisses the 
very real concerns of those whom 
he wants to represent, and fails 
to be an effective ally. Although 
Rosen issued an official apology 
on March 21, Facebook users felt 
the display of regret was too little, 
too late.

If you don’t think the lack of 

representation and dismissive 
attitudes toward marginalized 
students are crippling enough to 
the party’s race to the Michigan 
Union, how about Movement’s 
blatant populism? As the refrain 

of Rosen’s music video, the line 
“Give the campus back to the 
kids, they could use it,” deserves 
some attention. Language is a 
funny thing in that you can refer 
to something without explicitly 
saying 
so. 
When 
President 

Trump’s campaign promised to 
“Make America Great Again,” it 
evoked a reference to a previous 
time when the nation was great.

Similarly, when Rosen preaches 

about giving the campus back to 
the kids, he is implicitly saying 
that students don’t have the 
campus in the first place. This 
appeal to the masses of ordinary 
“kids” 
who 
are 
supposedly 

unrepresented 
and 
voiceless 

should be a classic, unproblematic 
campaign move if the party were 
representative. But when said 
“kids” exclude marginalized and 
truly underrepresented students, 
it reminds me less of a campaign 
move and more of a populist strategy 
appealing to only one population: 
non-marginalized 
students. 

The Economist recently defined 
populism 
as 
a 
non-ideological 

framework that pits the population 
against the corrupt establishment. 
This call by Movement is subtle, but 
once examined, is reminiscent of 
President Trump’s calls for swamp-
draining and great-making.

But when it comes down to the 

ballot, there’s one singular reason 
why Rosen’s Movement party 
shouldn’t be elected: It appears 
that he thinks he alone can help 
the University. In his op-ed for 
The Michigan Daily, Rosen wrote, 
“I created the Movement because 
I want to go to a university that 
lives up to its name, and because I 
see a potential for this school that 
I don’t think anyone else does.” 
Most readers should be pausing at 
this point, thinking about where 
they’ve heard this exact same 
rhetoric. If they need a clue, visit 
whitehouse.gov. Two years ago, 
then-officeless 
Donald 
Trump 

said at the onset of his campaign, 
“I am the only one who can make 
America 
truly 
great 
again!” 

Even in his Republican National 
Convention 
speech, 
President 

Trump exclaimed with full hubris, 
“I alone can fix it.” The go-it-alone 
mentality is not endearing or 
appealing. It has the potential to 
perpetuate campus issues.

Clearly 
the 
complications 

with Movement’s campaign are 
problematic 
in 
many 
different 

regards. On March 22 and 23, 
remember the problematic nature 
of Movement’s campaign, which has 
the potential to do more harm than 
good, when electing your next CSG 
president. Be sure to vote eMerge at

Conversing with ‘CHiPS’ 
stars Peña and Shepard

WARNER BROS.

“Party” is the one word Dax 

Shepard (“The Judge”) used to 
describe his upcoming movie 
“CHiPS,” which he wrote, 
directed and acts in.

The film is an action-packed 

comedy filled with motorcycle 
races and police investigations 
in the heart of Los Angeles. 
Jon Baker (Shepard) and Frank 
“Ponch” Poncherello (Michael 
Peña, “Collateral Beauty”) are 
two California Highway Patrol 
motorcycle officers who must 
join forces in order to figure 
out who within CHP is behind 
the million-dollar heist.

Ponch is a workaholic as an 

undercover FBI agent and he 
takes a pragmatic approach 
to his job. Baker, on the other 
hand, is inexperienced and 
immature, focused on keeping 
his marriage and life together.

“Both 
guys 
could 
easily 

foil the other one’s dream,” 
Shepard said.

Baker and Ponch may not 

see eye to eye, but in real life, 
Shepard and Peña interacted 
as close friends, with constant 
friendly banter. Both wearing 
plaid, this dynamic duo looked 
like real-life best friends.

“The whole thing felt like 

we stole a case of beer and we 
kept getting closer and closer 
to the door,” Shepard said. At 
any moment, they both felt as 
if someone would stop them in 
their quest to create this fun 
film.

“There’s been a stunning 

lack 
of 
motorcycle 
chase 

movies 
… 
[because] 
they 

are 
really 
hard 
to 
film,” 

Shepard said. “CHiPS” used 
drones, helicopters and new 

technology specifically for the 
movie.

Shepard did a lot of his own 

motorcycle stunts, including 
wheelies, riding on the beach 
and going up and down stairs. 
Peña 
had 
never 
ridden 
a 

motorcycle before, but learned 
to say lines while moving at 
over 75 miles per hour. 

“I can die. This is real … 

[Shepard] was proud of me 
like a dad” Peña said about his 
motorcycle experience on set. 
He remarked that he was more 
of a golf guy. 

College students may find 

this movie more relatable than 
it seems. The plot includes 
typical millennial follies, like 
sexting and FaceTiming the 
wrong person.

“That’s 
going 
on 
hourly 

I think on your campus,” 
Shepard said.

“I think this generation 

is definitely the generation 
of who wears the most yoga 
pants,” Peña, whose character 
has 
a 
penchant 
for 
tight 

clothing, said.

Both actors also had advice 

for students who may be 
wishing to pursue a career in 
acting, music or art.

“Just do, do, do,” Peña said. 

No matter what artistic field 
you are seeking, “you gotta 
find your voice.”

“You don’t get better at 

anything by thinking about it,” 
Shepard said on the subject. 
Action is key.

“My biggest passion is cars 

and motorcycles. Second to 
that is comedy. I’m praying 
that I can marry those two 
things together [in the movie],” 
Shepard said. 

“CHiPS”, though based on 

the late 1970’s TV show of the 
same name, surely holds its 

own.

“I wanted it to be its own 

thing,” Shepard said. “[I was] 
aiming towards “Bad Boys” or 
“Lethal Weapon.”” 

Though it takes place in 

the present, “CHiPS” refrains 
from using any contemporary 
music.

“I can’t stand when you see 

a movie that you love from a 
time period but it’s so time 
stamped by those pop 40 songs 
that they put in the movie that 
I find distracting, because they 
don’t age well. Every song in 
this movie has really stood the 
test of time,” said Shepherd, 
highlighting the song choice 
of “Rosanna” by Toto, used in 
the film. 

Shepard seems to add his 

own special mark to all his 
movies. In Hollywood, he is 
known for his ability to create 
high-grossing action movies 
out of a fairly low budget. 
The film “Hit and Run,” for 
example, made $14 million off 
a $1 million budget. 

“The action looks way, way 

bigger than the budget would 
suggest. That weirdly is now 
my sort of niche calling card,” 
Shepard said.

After this movie, Peña is 

on to other works such as a 
movie that shoots in Serbia for 
2 months, as well as “Ant-Man 
2.” 

As for Shepard, one can only 

guess where he is headed.

“Retirement,” Shepard said, 

with somewhat of a knowing 
smirk on his face.

“CHiPS” 
will 
open 
this 

Friday in theaters.

FILM INTERVIEW

Hamid’s ‘Exit West’ an 
emotive refugee romance

Author’s latest work is an exercise in empathy and humanity

I hate it when we talk about 

“humanizing” people. The word 
itself isn’t so bad, but in the 
context of politically-charged 
rhetoric — of people needing 
to read a touching magazine 
profile or a depressing personal 
narrative to simply be, well, 
not racist — I despise it. It’s 
the reason there’s still a sour 
taste left in my mouth from the 
infamous Khizr Khan episode 
at the Democratic 
National 
Convention 
in 

July. Here was a 
Muslim family on 
national television, 
finally 
accepted 

and beloved and 
recognized 
by 

the 
majority 
of 

the media, but I 
couldn’t help but think about 
how off-putting this scene was. 
Is this what it takes, I thought? 
Do I need to fight a war in some 
Middle Eastern country, be 
buried in an American Flag at 
Arlington, posthumously earn a 
Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, 
have 
my 
father 
frantically 

wave the Constitution on a 
stage in Philadelphia, home 
of the Liberty Bell, for Fox 
News to finally consider the 
possibility that we may, in fact, 
be Americans — humans, even? 
I have nothing but respect for 
the Khans, but the rest of us, 
those Muslims who might not 
be so militarily inclined, have 
no choice but to wonder if our 
own brand of patriotism can 
live up.

Midway 
through 
Mohsin 

Hamid’s fantastic new novel, 
“Exit 
West,” 
one 
of 
our 

protagonists, Nadia, a refugee 
fleeing a war-torn country, 
finally has the opportunity to 
wash her clothes. It has been 
weeks since she migrated, and 
her robes smell atrocious, so 
she takes the time to dunk them 
in a steaming hot bathtub and 
clean them. It’s an ostensibly 
trivial scene, even more so 
in such a broad and operatic 
narrative, but Hamid is quick 
to underscore its significance: 
“What she was doing, what she 
had just done, was for her not 
about frivolity, it was about the 
essential, about being human, 
living 
as 
a 
human 
being, 

reminding oneself of what one 
was, and so it mattered, and if 
necessary was worth a fight.”

“Humanizing refugees” — 

it’s a disappointing concept, 
not in its implications but 
in the mere necessity of its 
existence. Human beings don’t 
need to be humanized. Hamid 
understands this, and he also 
understands 
the 
massive, 

global scale of the current 
refugee crisis, and all the 
complications that portends.

“Exit 
West” 
toys 
with 

ideas like universality and 

accessibility. 
It’s a romance 
— a love story 
— between two 
migrants 
as 

they leave their 
dying country to 
try and secure 
a 
stable 
life, 

but it begins in 
an 
unspecified 

country, and our protagonists 
practice an unnamed religion, 
speak 
an 
unidentified 

language. The only characters 
with names in the novel are the 
two that comprise our central 
couple, 
Nadia 
and 
Saeed, 

because when the world is 
shrinking and your continued 
survival depends solely on your 
ability to make it out alive, the 
only ones who really matter are 
the ones you love, and the ones 
who love you, in the present. 
Not even, Hamid writes, the 
people from your past: “For 
when we migrate, we murder 
from our lives those we leave 
behind.”

It’s difficult to ascribe a 

more expansive message to 
a story so specifically about 
two people, but it’s equally 
difficult to read “Exit West” as 
some sort of intimate character 
study when its prose is so 
expansive. Hamid writes the 
story like it’s a fairytale, his 
balletic sentences long and 
run-on, unfurling gracefully 
over the course of countless 
commas and half-pages and 
full-pages 
until, 
eventually, 

they land with a resounding 
thud, 
packaging 
sharp 

social critiques in beautiful, 
mesmerizing phrasing.

The novel is, of course, 

politically relevant; refugees 
and immigration are a hot-
button issue, but Hamid is 
more 
concerned 
with 
the 

conditions that force someone 

to leave their home. Indeed, 
the novel is split down the 
middle, one half chronicling 
the downward spiral of Nadia 
and Saeed’s home country as 
their love blossoms, the other 
half detailing their hop from 
country to country in search of 
refuge.

Into 
this 
backdrop 
of 

political realism Hamid injects 
a substantial dose of Rushdie-
like 
magical 
realism; 
the 

couple’s travels are predicated 
on 
deceptively 
elementary 

premise, a network of doors 
that one simply steps through 
to end up in another country 
across the world. The author is 
interested in distance, it seems 
— distance between countries, 
distance 
between 
cultures, 

distance between people, all of 
it shrinking. Nadia and Saeed 
are plugged into their mobile 
phones, connecting to people 
from across the world, and 
the doors are simply a clever 
thematic device through which 
Hamid explores the ironies and 
nuances of the entire concept 
of immigration. He prods at 
thorny ideas of nations and 
multiculturalism and what it 
means to have a “home.” But 
it’s never once didactic or dull; 
rather, Hamid examines his 
interests through the prism 
of his two broadly drawn yet 
undeniably captivating leads.

It’s entirely possible some 

will read “Exit West” as a 
tender romance and nothing 
more. 
But 
it’s 
virtually 

impossible to not feel, at the 
very least, a sense of empathy. 
As Hamid implies throughout, 
Nadia and Saeed’s story is but 
one of many. They are the focal 
point of this narrative, but their 
experience is not uncommon. 
As much as it hurts to reckon 
with, this world — its leaders 
and its citizens — is lacking 
in empathy. “Exit West,” of 
course, is not a corrective to all 
the ills we have committed in 
the name of “border security,” 
but perhaps it will serve as a 
useful reminder of the unique 
power fiction often holds over 
the stark realities of everyday 
life. The need to “humanize” 
is characteristic only of the 
morally deficient, but if that’s 
what it takes for migrants 
to be considered deserving 
of a home, for refugees to be 
deemed the humans they are, 
then so be it.

ALBUM REVIEW

Hot Thoughts is Spoon’s 

ninth studio album, continuing 
a legacy started in the late ’90s, 
and 
the 
fact 

that the band 
hasn’t 
faded 

into repetitious 
irrelevancy 
is 

a feat in and of 
itself. Instead, 
their newest release takes a 
finely honed sound and infuses 
it with harmonies that burst 
with vibrancy. Hot Thoughts is 
a Picasso painting of an album: 
An enthusiastic collection of 
songs that each strive to stand 
out from the rest.

The opening track, “Hot 

Thoughts” 
introduces 
the 

rest of the album with a bang; 
jangling rhythms paired with 
lead 
singer 
Britt 
Daniel’s 

pointed 
vocals 
immediately 

grab 
attention 
and 
add 
a 

sweeping new dimension to 
the standard chorus of “hot 
thoughts all in my mind all of 
the time.”

“WhisperI’lllistentohearit” 

directly 
follows 
“Hot 

Thoughts” and smoothly picks 
up where the first song left off. 

However, instead of continuing 
the same melody, it shifts in 
an 
entirely 
new 
direction. 

Vibrating tempos and Daniel’s 
echoing whisper building to an 
electric shriek of guitar chords 
cloaks the song in a darker, 

more cynical, layer.

The rapid tempo 

of Hot Thoughts’ 
second track comes 
screeching 
to 
a 

halt as the mellow 
tempo of “Do I Have 

to Talk You Into It” crawls 
into the spotlight. Swinging 
harmonies and breezy beats 
diffuses the condensed energy 
built up by the previous song 
and allows a more relaxed air 
to surround the album.

The rest of Hot Thoughts 

continues in a similar way; 
songs 
expand 
on 
elements 

introduced 
by 
their 

predecessors and ultimately 
aim to transport the album in 
a distinctive direction. “Pink 
Up” takes the succession of 
spiraling piano chords and 
harshly 
dramatic 
beats 
of 

“First Caress” and softens 
them, turning the album from 
energetic exclamations to quiet 
murmurs without losing its 
overall flow. “Shotgun” takes 
the sprawling “Tear It Down” 

and 
condenses 
its 
sound, 

speeding up the tempo and 
adding a newfound stability.

Hot Thoughts is a continuous 

cycle 
of 
construction 
and 

destruction; 
no 
one 
track 

sounds the same.

However, even though Hot 

Thoughts is thrilling to listen 
to, it still follows the Spoon 
blueprint. The band has made 
sure every new album released 
added a slight alteration to 
their original sound: A refined 
blend of punk, pop and rock 
that 
was 
well-established 

with the creation of “A Series 
of Sneaks” in 1998. While the 
colorful electronic components 
and funky instrumentals found 
in Hot Thoughts might be a 
novel experiment for Spoon, 
the underlying elements of 
minimalist vocals and brash 
rhythms is nothing new.

But, as the liveliness of Hot 

Thoughts displays, this band is 
not tired in the least, despite 
doggedly sticking to mostly 
analogous album structures. 
Utterly refusing to step away 
from the spotlight, Spoon still 
remains full of ideas for future 
exploration.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
In spite of the great idea

One of the largest obstacles to 

creation is the development of the 
idea behind it. Often one may sit 
and wait, wondering what to make, 
what to write about or where to 
draw inspiration from.

Often, I find myself waiting 

for inspiration to hit. As a former 
dancer and choreographer, I would 
stand in the studio in complete 
stillness, with no ideas and no 
movement. The idea would never 
come, and I would choreograph 
in 
desperation, 
aching 
for 
a 

breakthrough. 
Eventually, 

choreography would be created, 
usually due to an impending 
deadline.

Some 
people 
argue 
that 

inspiration 
is 
unnecessary, 

that waiting for inspiration is a 
mechanism for artists to hide 
their fear. I have had art teachers 
dismiss the notion of “inspiration,” 
saying it has nothing to do with 
creation. Creation, they would say, 
comes from doing and not waiting. 
One could wait for years and have 
nothing to show for it. These 
art teachers would also say that 
waiting for inspiration is a tactic 
used to let your fears fester inside 
of you, convincing you to never pick 

up the pen, marker or paintbrush. 

This is partially true. Fear is often 

what holds you back from reaching 
greater potentials. However, the 
work done without inspiration 
can be more significant than the 
work done with the great big idea. 
This work contains the true grit 
of an artist, who pushes past the 
fear and insecurities and has the 
courage 
to 
create 
something, 

without the framework of an idea. 
It contains the true essence of 
the artist who lost his way in the 
process of creation but still himself 
along the way, just enough to make 
something. The pieces I have 
created in desperation are the most 
accurate representations of my 
work, because they reflected the 
dedication it took for me to keep 
going.

I have had other art teachers tell 

me that a great idea is very much 
needed, but not at the beginning. 
I 
understand 
parts 
of 
this 

argument, whether or not art needs 
inspiration, because inspiration 
does serve a purpose. It fuels 
artists with a drive to continue 
doing what they do, bringing forth 
an energy and appreciation for 
art. Instead of stopping you in the 
beginning, it feeds you a little bit 
at a time, getting you through the 
exhaustive process of creation. I 
have started out with nothing, only 

to find inspiration at the smallest 
moments in a dance, giving me 
enough to remember why I love it 
and continue to do what I do.

This does not mean that the great 

idea does not exist. While it is not a 
myth, it is rare, which is why it is 
important to keep creating despite 
the great idea. Pushing through 
without a huge surge of inspiration 
gives artists the backbone of their 
practices. It creates discipline, 
training artists in preparation 
for their masterpiece. It gives the 
technique, willpower and artistry 
needed to really polish their work.

In 
this 
way, 
artists 
and 

intellectuals are similar. We all 
go through days of frustration, 
wishing we had a spark of 
inspiration to keep us going. We all 
push through, forcing ourselves to 
continue on the work that we have 
already spent so much time on.

But we will not always have this 

spark at the beginning. We may not 
even have this spark in the middle 
of the process or at the end — 
despite this, we must keep creating. 
Because one day, we will get that 
great idea, and we will be more 
than ready for it. In the meantime, 
we must find the significance 
behind the work we do without 
inspiration, because this work is a 
part of us too, containing our true 
artistic grit and determination.

“Baby, it never gets old and 

that’s just how it goes.”

This 
line 
is 
rapped 
with 

subtlety on “Do Not Disturb,” 
the final track of Drake’s new 
“playlist” / official-studio-project 
More Life, which was released 
on Saturday. It acts as a simple 
bridge between other epic bars 
that are clearly more intended to 
turn into viral “tweet-ables,” but 
it’s Drake’s most honest lyric on 
the project, vividly capturing his 
signature charm in one snippy, 
circular expression.

Why is Aubrey Graham — 

now almost a full decade into 
his construction of the Drake 
caricature — still trying to coin 
trends (“playlist,” “blem”), fend off 
non-threatening rappers (Meek 
Mill, Tory Lanez) and establish 
pre-meditated hype for his next 
release (“I’ll be back 2018 to to 
give you the summary”)? Because 
it never gets old. That’s just how it 
goes. At least, it has been so far for 
Drake.

More 
Life 
doesn’t 
bring 

anything particularly new to 
Drake’s 
discography: 
Though 

his lingo has (controversially) 
expanded to include some exotic 

slang, the project’s soundscape 
is still defined (across 22 whole 
tracks) 
by 
big 
trap 
drums, 

“chipmunk” soul samples and 
island-inspired pop dives. It plays 
something like a walk-through 
of his greatest hits, re-creating 
within their well-tested spaces 
in 
a 
way 
that’s 

guaranteed 
to 
produce 

in-character 
anthems.

“Madiba Riddim” 

inherits 
rhythms 

from “Controlla” much like “Get 
It Together” takes its concept 
from “Take Care.” “Gyalchester” 
shares unique similarities with 
the 
“The 
Language.” 
“Free 

Smoke” would fit in fine on If 
You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, 
just as “Jorja Interlude” would on 
Nothing Was The Same. “Nothings 
Into Somethings” could be an 
interlude on So Far Gone. The 
project’s grand finale, “Do Not 
Disturb,” is the most obviously 
sequential of them all, its proper 
title 
(“7AM 
In 
Germany”) 

arriving as a lyrical anecdote to 
ensure that it’s attached, at least 
spiritually, to Drake’s ongoing 
series of “freestyles.”

For this reason, many will 

dismiss More Life as a stagnant 
release, but that’s too easy of an 

assessment for a Drake project, 
especially after all of his lofty 
predictions have come to blossom. 
For a singsongy rapper whose 
main shtick is a sharp smile 
coupled 
with 
slick, 
boastful 

wordplay, 
things 
truly 
could 

not have worked out any better: 

Mixtape 
Drake 

turned 
into 
a 

superstar. 
Now 

his braggadocio is 
at least warranted, 
his 
shots 
that 

much louder and 

more chilling. 

Alas, still trapped in the same 

self-indulgent 
role 
that 
he’s 

inhabited since we met him, 
Aubrey Graham performs all over 
the world on More Life, boasting 
the 
even-more 
glamorous 

luxuries of his most recent 
commercial success (Views), and 
taking another expectable turn at 
curating the future tastes of hip-
hop fans. He brings out friends, 
some of whom now stem from 
different continents, and tiptoes 
on tracks that inherently feel 
like their creations, branding the 
songs as October’s Very Own’s in 
an expectable tradition that their 
artists still seem to be weirdly 
appreciative of.

Yet, 
More 
Life 
will 
be 

remembered as the beginning of 

a comedown, the visible, tangible, 
downloadable conclusion to a 
past chapter of hip-hop wherein 
“Drake-featuring-Drake” 
was 

a sure-fire recipe for a rap hit, 
and during which every other 
artist’s feature felt somehow less 
relevant.

On 
already-massive 
hits 

“Portland” 
and 
“Ice 
Melts,” 

Quavo and Young Thug outshine 
him immensely, each adding some 
extra excitement to the project’s 
release (which, for the first time 
in a long time, Drake might have 
actually needed).

“Sacrifices” 
sounds 
like 

something we would normally 
expect to hear on a 2 Chainz 
album, and Drake feels similarly 
transplanted onto his tracks with 
Giggs (“No Long Talk,” “KMT”), 
both of which seem like somewhat 
forced 
collaborations 
(despite 

their abilities to rattle speakers on 
command).

Songs from Sampha (“4422”) 

and Skepta (“Skepta Interlude”) 
are also included, neither of 
which feature Drake, but both of 
which shine on their own terms. 
No guest, however, manages 
to outshine Kanye West. His 
co-produced experiment, “Glow,” 
is an odd electro-duet on which he 
and Drake go back-and-forth in a 
desperate attempt to be iconic, 

the perfect pair, and it will surely 
have its credibility debated by rap 
fans for a while.

The solo Drake cuts on More 

Life, as usual, have their own 
ways 
of 
making 
themselves 

relevant. “Passionfruit” became a 
guaranteed dance floor sensation 
the moment that it landed on 
Beats 
Radio1 
airwaves, 
and 

though it may sound strikingly 
similar to some former Drake hits, 
just re-packaged and finer tuned 
for his now multi-faceted fanbase, 
no one has seemed too hung up 
on this fact in the days since its 
release.

More Life offers brief, mostly 

disconnected tastes of Jamaican 

dancehall 
grooviness, 
British 

grime aggression, moody Toronto 
bedroom crooning (which Drake 
helped coin aside his formerly-
underground friend The Weeknd) 
and, 
of 
course, 
classically 

American pop formatting. The 
meager glue binding its 22 tracks 
together is their overtly-defensive 
Drake tone, one that we’re all so 
familiar with by now, defined 
by its half-witty broadcasting of 
bank figures and hyper-personal 
reflecting on the past via trendy 
singsong features. The only thing 
new is his (amazingly) ever-
increasing clout. Still bragging 
about the radio play that he and his 
friends receive, Drake raps, “If we 
not on the charts, my XO n*ggas 
eatin’ / 52 consecutive weekends, 
shout out The Weeknd,” on “Lose 
You,” the project’s on-cue inward 
reflection.

The act might get old soon, 

especially if Drake returns from 
his now-well-teased hiatus to 
Toronto, another year older, only 
to hand in yet another highly-
marketed, 
loosely-organized 

collection of snarky flexes and 
seemingly 
uninspired 
R&B 

efforts. (I am not sure anyone can 
handle another Drake track on 
which he wonders: “How come 
we can never hook up and stay 
friends?”). But in the meantime, 
while he still has the world’s 
attention, Drake offers us a 
playlist — not exactly an original 
project, but a collection of styles 
and ideas that he expects to catch 
and keep his brand afloat.

Like he said: “That’s just how it 

goes.”

Blanco leads ‘M’ past Bowling Green

The Wolverines may have had 

to wait six days longer than they 
wished, but they were ready out 
of the gate 
Tuesday. 

The 

Michigan 
softball 
team 
(18-7-1) 
proved 

themselves 
unfazed 
by 
two 

weather 
postponements 
last 

week that pushed back a matchup 
with 
Bowling 
Green 
(14-17) 

originally scheduled for March 
15. The Wolverines jumped on 
the Falcons’ right-hander Brooke 
Parker early and never looked 
back, outlasting Bowling Green, 
7-1.

A Falcon error in the first inning 

allowed junior right-hander Tera 
Blanco to reach first base to load 
the bases. The gaffe immediately 
proved costly for the Falcons, as 
a hit-by-pitch and a sharp RBI 
single from senior third baseman 
Lindsay Montemerano brought 
in the first two runs of the game. 
Junior infielder Amanda Vargas 
followed that up with a two-run 
single to break the game open and 
give Michigan an early four-run 
lead.

Michigan would grab two more 

runs on another Vargas single in 
the bottom of the third inning to 
extend the lead to 6-0 and chase 
Parker from the game.

“The goal is to outscore the 

other team,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “It’s always nice 
to jump ahead — it puts the other 
team on their heels — but right 
now I’ll take runs any way we can 
get them.”

For a team that has struggled 

with runners in scoring position 
this 
season, 
Vargas’ 
calm 

approach in those situations was 
a welcome sign. The key for her, 
she says, is maintaining the same 
mental approach.

“Pretty much the mindset is, 

‘You need to just be calm, relaxed, 

and do everything you we do in 
practice’ … taking our normal cuts 
and not overthinking it,” Vargas 
said. “We just need to calm down.” 
 

With the six-run cushion, 

Blanco took care of the rest in the 
circle.

Against 
a 
patient, 
but 

overmatched 
lineup, 
Blanco 

allowed one run on five hits in her 
complete-game outing.

Blanco was also able to keep 

the ball in the zone against a 
Bowling Green lineup that has 
walked over 80 times this season, 
surrendering only one walk on 
the day while also adding eight 
strikeouts. 

Continuing 
to 
show 

improvement in that category, 
Blanco allowed just two free-
passes in her last 21 innings, in 
sharp contrast to the 25 walks she 

allowed in her first 52.2 innings of 
the year.

She was tested, though, in 

the top of the fifth inning, when 
Bowling Green managed an RBI 
single to put runners on first and 
second with only one out. But 
Blanco snuffed out the potential 
rally, 
striking 
out 
outfielder 

Kendyl Wheeler and fielding a 
grounder cleanly to get the runner 
at first to end the threat.

“I think she’s just getting 

more comfortable in her role 
as our other pitcher,” Hutchins 
said. “Like, she’s pitching every 
other game, I think she’s gotten 
comfortable in that role for 
us. She’s owning it, she knows 
we count on her, I think she’s 
accepting it and embracing it.”

Sophomore 
catcher 
Katie 

Alexander immediately grabbed 

the 
run 
back, 
putting 
an 

exclamation point on the win with 
a no-doubt, solo home run to left-
center field to extend the lead back 
to six. The home run was her first 
of the season, another positive 
sign for Alexander, who seems to 
be heating up in the batters box 
and seizing the regular starting 
job behind the plate.

And as the team moves forward, 

it may be contributions from the 
likes of Alexander, Vargas and 
others that give Michigan the 
necessary boost to move past its 
prolongued slump.

With the pitching rotation 

starting to stabilize — and if that 
slump is indeed over — more 
offensive consistency could be 
the final piece to the puzzle as the 
team heads towards conference 
play.

Barnes Arico to face
former team in NIT

Fifteen years ago, Kim Barnes 

Arico accepted the position of head 
coach at St. John’s in Queens, N.Y., 
after helming Adelphi’s program 
for three seasons. She was moving, 
for the first time, into Division I 
women’s basketball. 

Fast forward 10 years, and Barnes 

Arico exited that program as the 
winningest coach in school history 
with a total of 176 victories. In her 
final season with the Red Storm, 
her team went 24-10 and advanced 
— for the first time — to the Sweet 16 
in the NCAA Tournament. 

At the end of the season, though, 

Barnes Arico left a program that she 
had built almost from the ground 
up – before her arrival the team had 
never won a game in the Big East – 
to become a Wolverine. 

And, for the first time in her five-

year tenure as the head coach of 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team, Barnes Arico is set to face her 
previous school. 

“It’s definitely a little emotional 

for me,” Barnes Arico said. “But, at 
the end of the day, I bleed blue.

“(I’m going to show) no mercy, 

for sure,” Barnes Arico said. “St. 
John’s will always hold this special 
place in my heart.”

Since Barnes Arico’s departure, 

Joe Tartamella serves as the head 
of St. John’s program. Previous to 
that position, he had been on staff 
for nine seasons under Barnes 
Arico and had served four of them 
as associate head coach. Tartamella 
is known for his recruitment. 

Tartamella isn’t the only familiar 

face that Barnes Arico will see 
on the opposing bench Thursday. 
Assistant coach Da’Shena Stevens 
played for Barnes Arico, assistant 
coach Jonath Nicholas also assisted 
Barnes Arico, and the director of 
basketball 
operations, 
Veronica 

Mullen, was a player for Barnes 
Arico at Adelphi. 

Predictably, Barnes Arico holds a 

place for them all. 

“My former graduate assistant — 

who married one of my assistants 
who had played for me — is the head 
coach now and they have three little 
kids,” Barnes Arico said. “They’re 
going to bring the whole family out 
and a bunch of my players are on 
the bench there as well as former 
players.” 

Notably, St. John’s has infiltrated 

Crisler Center not just through 
Barnes Arico, but also through 
Michigan assistant coaches Joy 
McCorvey and Megan Duffy who 
played and sidelined, respectively, 
under Barnes Arico as a Red Storm.

The large, albeit unconventional, 

community that Ann Arbor and 
Queens share will be put to the 
test in the upcoming fourth-round 
game of the WNIT. Barnes Arico 
has been able to dodge the bullet of 
competing against her former team 
before, but was unsuccessful this 
year. 

While a Wolverine, Barnes Arico 

has managed to bring Michigan to 
an NCAA Tournament appearance 
her first year here in 2012, as 
well as appear in four WNITs — 
though the snubs by the NCAA 
selection committee mar the latter 
accomplishment. 

At the end of the day, Barnes 

Arico is ready to bring her team past 
Thursday’s battle. Her players have 
been reiterating they want to do this 
to prove a point that they deserved a 
bid to the NCAA Tournament, they 
want to do this for their seniors 
and they want to do this to unfurl 
a WNIT championship banner for 
the first time at Crisler.

“I am thrilled this game is going 

to be at Crisler,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And in front of our home fans to 
give our team an opportunity, once 
again, to play on our home court.”

Michigan prepping for high-powered WMU

On Tuesday, Michigan coach 

Erik Bakich was asked about his 
No. 18 Michigan baseball team’s 
upcoming Big Ten debut against 
Maryland this weekend on WTKA. 
Bakich quickly pointed out that 
the Wolverines “can’t look ahead” 
past their Wednesday showdown 
against Western Michigan at Ray 
Fisher Stadium. 

Wisely, Bakich isn’t overlooking 

the Broncos (9-7), who have 
won eight of their last 10 games, 
including a victory this past Sunday 
at Evansville, 4-3. The Wolverines 
are equally hot, winning eight of 
nine and sweeping their Sunday 
doubleheader against Northern 
Illinois.

While coming out on top is 

always the goal, state supremacy 
is also on the line. The last time 
the two state foes played – March 
26, 2014 – Michigan won 12-4. 
The Wolverines (15-4) will look 
to continue their winning ways 
against Western Michigan and 
garner the upper hand in the 

matchup.

Nevertheless, Michigan and 

junior pitcher Jayce Vancena have 
a daunting task ahead of them, 
facing a fierce Broncos lineup. 
Western Michigan ranks 10th in 
the NCAA with a .327 team batting 
average and boasts an impressive 
.418 on-base percentage. The 
Broncos’ offense is led by junior 
Tanner Allison, who earned a Mid-
American West Conference player 
of the week nod last month. Allison, 
an outfielder who also pitches, 
leads 
Western 

Michigan 
in 

hits, 
slugging 

percentage, runs 
scored, 
home 

runs, runs batted 
in 
and 
batting 

average at .435.

In 
order 
to 

overcome 
the 

efficient Broncos 
offense, 
Bakich 

will 
implement 

the 
same 

unassuming game plan the team 
has used all season.

“The recipe for us has been 

very simple,” Bakich said. “Quality 
starts, good defense, timely hits. 
That’s really been our key to 
finding ways to win.”

While reliable play in all phases 

of the game will be necessary to 
defeat Western Michigan, the 
Wolverines will have to continue 
their impressive play on defense. 
Michigan currently ranks 14th 
in the NCAA with a .982 fielding 
percentage. 

“One 
thing 
we’ve 
done 

consistently is played a high level 

of defense with 
some really good 
playmakers on the 
field,” Bakich said.

Throughout 

the 
early 
part 

of 
the 
season, 

Bakich repeatedly 
complimented his 
team’s 
defense. 

He is not only 
impressed 
with 

their 
ability 
to 

make the routine 

plays, but also the web-gem plays 
that give momentum to the squad 
and can often save runs.

For Michigan to come out 

victorious, it must continue its 
strong play on defense, as only one 
error may prove the difference 
against the talented bats of the 
Broncos. Given any extra outs, 
Western 
Michigan 
possesses 

the offense to capitalize with 
additional runs. 

The Wolverines will also look 

to separate themselves on the 
basepaths. 
Michigan 
currently 

ranks fourth in the NCAA with 
2.26 steals per game and ranks 
fifth with 43 stolen bases. The 
Wolverines’ aggressive approach 
on the bases should allow them to 
put runners in scoring position and 
could potentially lead to the game-
defining run.

However, Michigan may see 

limited success on the bases 
against the Broncos, as Western 
Michigan 
catcher 
Jesse 

Forestell has allowed just four 
stolen bases on the season.

While Michigan possesses 

the personnel to come out 
victorious, Western Michigan’s 
offense and catcher will be lofty 
obstacles to overcome.

Coughlan lifts monkey 
off Wolverines’ backs

In an exciting back-and-forth 

battle, the Michigan women’s 
lacrosse team claimed its first 
Big Ten victory in program 
history by taking down Ohio 
State (0-1 Big Ten, 5-5 overall) 
in overtime, 12-11. It marks 
the Wolverines’ first win over 
the Buckeyes in their last five 
meetings.

Michigan (1-0, 3-7) rolled 

into Columbus on Saturday 
riding the momentum it gained 
from a blowout win over Detroit 
on 
Wednesday 
night. 
That 

energy was zapped early in the 
game, however, as the Buckeyes 
jumped out to a 5-1 lead.

The Wolverines rallied in 

the final seven minutes of the 
first half, led by senior attacker 
Lauren 
Oberlander, 
who 

scored four goals in the game. 
Sophomore goalie Mira Shane 
stopped a free-position attempt 
in the waning moments of the 
frame, allowing the Wolverines 
to enter halftime down just two 
goals with momentum on their 
side.

“We had about 20 shots in 

the first half, we just weren’t 
placing 
them 
the 
way 
we 

needed 
to,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Jennifer Ulehla. “So, we 
talked about it at halftime, and 
I knew we were going to get just 
as many opportunities, it’s just 
a matter of really being able to 
finish it.”

As 
Ulehla 
expected, 

Michigan’s 
opportunities 

eventually 
translated 
into 

goals 
in 
the 
second 
half. 

During a stretch in which they 
scored five straight times, the 
Wolverines took their first 
lead of the game, 8-7 with 14:10 
remaining. Just over three 
minutes later, senior midfielder 
Anna Schueler scored her 100th 
career goal to extend the lead 
to 9-7.

With less than five minutes 

to play, Michigan held an 11-8 
lead. But, similar to the rest 
of the team’s wins since the 

program’s inception, it would 
not come easily.

Ohio State scored two quick 

goals to cut the Wolverines’ lead 
to one. Stunned, the Wolverines 
struggled 
to 
maintain 
the 

energy that had carried them on 
that 5-0 run early in the second 
half. With just 43.3 seconds 
left in regulation, the Buckeyes 
scored a third consecutive goal 
to tie the game at 11 apiece. 
The game would come down to 
sudden-death overtime.

“I (told the team) that every 

single one of you has to be 
thinking that we’re coming up 
with this draw and we’re going 
down on the offensive end and 
that we’re going to shoot and 
score. Period. There is no way 
that we are leaving this stadium 
without a ‘W’,” Ulehla said.

Inspired by Ulehla’s message, 

the Wolverines put the final 
five minutes of the second half 
behind 
them 
and 
returned 

to the field with a renewed 
intensity in overtime. After 
winning the draw, they set up 
their offense and prepared to 
strike. 

The ball got tossed around 

the perimeter for nearly a 
minute before it finally ended 
up in the netting of senior 
attacker Kim Coughlan’s stick 
in front of the goal. Like she 
has so many times during her 
illustrious 
Michigan 
career, 

Coughlan 
delivered 
with 
a 

game-winning shot and gave 
the Wolverines the thrilling 
12-11 victory.

“It was unbelievable. All 

the seniors after that goal just 
looked at each other and broke 
down,” Coughlan said. “We’ve 
been working for this for four 
years now.”

Michigan 
will 
look 
to 

extend its winning streak to 
three games when it hosts 
Northwestern 
on 
Thursday. 

And with the burden of winning 
their first Big Ten game finally 
lifted, the Wolverines look 
forward to the rest of their 
conference 
schedule 
with 

increased confidence.

Wagner ready to introduce himself to nation

For Moe Wagner, it’s show 

time every time he steps on the 
basketball court.

The sophomore’s play has 

been eye-popping recently. What 
other 6-foot-11 forward can euro 
step to the hoop on a fast break, 
fool opponents with a patented 
behind-the-back dribble and nail 
a fade-away three with relative 
ease?

As 
Wagner’s 
play 
grabs 

more and more attention over 
Michigan’s 
postseason, 
his 

personality and emotions make 
him one of the Sweet 16’s must-
watch players.

Over the past few weeks, 

Wagner has been seen laughing 
on the bench, roaring after 
putting down a huge dunk and 
looking appalled after getting hit 
with a surprise foul call.

Now in the Sweet 16, Wagner 

finally has a stage big enough 
to fit his bursting personality in 
America.

“One of my youth coaches 

used to say that I was someone 
who sees the basketball court 
as a stage and really enjoys it,” 
Wagner said. “Last year I really 
started to understand what that 
really means and embraced that 
this year. That’s just me. I really 
love it and I really enjoy it. I try to 
use it as my advantage.”

In the Wolverines’ win over 

Louisville on Sunday, Wagner 
put on one of his most signature 
performances of the season. The 
forward scored a career-high 26 
points while shooting 75 percent 
from the field. He showed scalpel-
like precision cutting through the 
Cardinals’ long, lengthy and deep 
frontcourt and helped Michigan 
overcome an eight-point halftime 
deficit to stay alive and advance in 
the tournament.

Also on display Sunday was 

Wagner’s 
unique 
personality. 

No one rode the emotional roller 
coaster of that game to higher-
highs 
and 
lower-lows 
than 

Wagner.

The sophomore was relishing 

every moment, yelling whenever 
he got inside and finished a dunk 
or layup at the hoop. He was seen 
embracing his partner in the 
frontcourt — redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson — when the 
pair combined for a big play. And 
when it was all over, Wagner 
stopped and kneeled down on the 
court where he stood, and shed a 
couple tears as his teammates ran 
over to celebrate.

But that’s all the good stuff.
Wagner 
has 
struggled 
to 

contain his negative emotions 
at times, and he showed his 

emotional 
cracks 
against 

Louisville. After scoring baskets, 
senior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
had to remind Wagner multiple 
times to get back and play 
defense.

“You 
can 
see 
(Walton),” 

Wagner said. “He always hits me 
in the chest like I’m a tree. I’m 
like ‘Dude, chill, relax.’ I guess 
you can do that with me because 
I’m so emotional. I think that’s 
how it is supposed to be. We’re 
so close with each other, we give 
(each other) a lot of crap and we 
all love each other after the game 
when we win.”

And then there are Wagner’s 

reactions when he’s called for 
controversial 
fouls. 
Coming 

from Europe, Wagner wasn’t 
accustomed to hearing so many 
whistles when he first began to 
adjust to the college game. While 
he’s gotten better about it, the 
sophomore still has moments 
when he’ll freak out or put on a 
very surprised face that stands 
out to everyone.

One 
of 
those 
reactions 

happened against the Cardinals 
toward the end of the first half. 
Wagner was called for a reach-in 
foul on a play that looked like a 
clean steal upon replay. Shocked 
by the call — which was his 

second foul of the half — Wagner 
kept running down the court 
displaying a face of disbelief.

“I saw in the (Louisville) film 

I got called for a foul before 
halftime,” Wagner said. “I just 
ran and kept running. In the NBA 
two years ago, that’s a technical 
foul. So I’ve got to stop. I guess 
that’s a lot to experience, just 
keep working on it.”

Wagner realizes he needs 

to limit moments like that, 
especially as the stage gets bigger 
and bigger for the Wolverines.

“I’m still in the process of 

learning how to control my 
emotions,” Wagner said. “It’s 

really good at sometimes having 
good 
emotions, 
just 
being 

positive, and helping the team 
with that. At the same time, 
negative 
emotions 
can 
take 

energy and can be dangerous to a 
team’s chemistry during a game. 
I’m still trying to figure out the 
right balance.”

But if there’s anyone who’s 

ready to star for Michigan when 
it takes the court for the Sweet 
16 on Thursday, it’s Wagner. The 
German is ready to let America 
get to know him, especially if it’s 
in the context of the Wolverines 
continuing their postseason hot 
streak in Kansas City.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Sophomore forward Moritz Wagner has made a name for himself throughout the postseason, and that should only continue when the Wolverines play Oregon in the Sweet 16 on Thursday night.

Hockey season in review: Offense takes steep dive

With the Michigan hockey team’s 

2016-17 season in the books, the 

Daily looks back at the performance 
of each unit this year and looks 
ahead to the 2017-18 season. 

Offense: (No. 5 Big Ten, No. 

42 NCAA)

Entering 
the 
season, 
the 

main question surrounding the 
Michigan hockey team was how 
it would replace all the offensive 
firepower it had lost from the 

2015-16 season. The Wolverines 
were returning only one of their 
top seven scorers — senior forward 
Alex Kile — and the rest of their 
offense was made up of largely 

unknown commodities.

Michigan never really found 

an answer to that question, 
either. Freshmen forwards Jake 
Slaker and Will Lockwood led 
the Wolverines in scoring with 
21 and 20 points, respectively. 
But that mark wasn’t nearly 
good enough to fuel the offense 
to success, as they didn’t even 
break the top 30 in the Big Ten in 
points.

The 
returning 
Michigan 

players that were expected to 
contribute fell short, too. Junior 
forward Tony Calderone led 
the team with 15 goals, but Kile 
finished with just 14 points total, 
and though sophomore forward 
Cooper Marody showed flashes 
of brilliance, he missed the entire 
first half of the season due to 
academic ineligibility. He also 
finished with 14 points.

The one place where the 

Wolverines 
had 
success 

offensively was on the power play 
— they finished the year with the 
17th-ranked unit nationally. But 
that wasn’t enough to salvage 
Michigan’s offense overall, as it 

struggled to maintain consistency 
in terms of putting the puck in its 
opponent’s net all season.

Defense: (No. 4 Big Ten, No. 

44 NCAA)

With the offense in a rebuilding 

process from the start of the 
season, 
it 
seemed 
that 
the 

Wolverines would rely on their 
slightly more experienced defense 
and its highly-touted freshmen 
goaltenders to keep them in 
games.

But right from the beginning 

of the season, Michigan struggled 
with shot suppression, and it 
ended up giving up the eighth-
most shots against in the country, 
putting a lot of pressure on its 
goaltenders.

At times, the netminders were 

up to the challenge. Freshman 
Hayden Lavigne earned a shutout 
in his first career win against 
Union and followed it up with 
a shutout win against then-No. 
4 Boston University. Freshman 
Jack LaFontaine helped his team 
to a win against Ferris State with 
a stellar effort, too. Then, at the 
end of the season, senior Zach 
Nagelvoort finished with two 
shutouts of his own in his final 
four starts.

But it turned out that the 

trio’s flashes of brilliance were 

unsustainable 
for 
the 
entire 

season. They were ultimately 
unable to keep up with the 
enormous amounts of shots they 
faced on a night-to-night basis, 
accruing 
a 
3.12 
goals-against 

average.

The Wolverines struggled on 

the penalty kill, too, as that unit 
ended the year No. 37 in the nation. 
 

Overall: (No. 5 Big Ten, No. 37 

Pairwise)

Even with all the question 

marks coming into the season, 
Michigan entered the season 
ranked No. 11. But it was quickly 
evident 
that 
the 
Wolverines 

weren’t going to be able to live up 
to that ranking, and, other than 
goaltending, they didn’t answer 
any of their preseason questions.

After finishing fifth in the Big 

Ten standings and No. 37 in the 
country, Michigan still doesn’t 
know if it will be able to keep up 
offensively or defensively next 
season, and, in addition, it may 
have a coaching vacancy to fill 
this offseason, as rumors persist 
that coach Red Berenson may 
retire.

All in all, the 2016-17 season 

was a disappointment for the 
Wolverines, and it is unclear if 
things will be getting better for 
them soon. 

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson has been rumored to be mulling retirement following the 2016-17 season.

ART MATTERS

proposed NEA elimination threatens performing arts 


M

y best friend 
from 
the 

University 
of 

Washington messaged me 
the other day: “Last class of 
my undergraduate degree!” 
I 
responded 
positively, 

albeit less animated than 
usual as I was waking up 
from a nap. When I got up 
from my bed, I walked to 
the bathroom and stared 
at my reflection. I was 
panicking.

In five weeks I’ll be 

sending 
that 
same 
text 

message.

(To be fair, I’m distracting 

myself by mentally planning 
exactly what alumni apparel 
I get to drop $300 on at 
the M Den.) (As if. I’ll be 
buying the $20 gray hooded 
sweatshirt with “Michigan 
Alumni” emblazoned on the 
breast that you find in that 
bonus room on the second 
floor that smells slightly 
like library books.)

I tend to think that 

something is much, much 
harder (grandiose, or easier 
or happier) than it really is. 
I hype something up to the 
point that I’m creating an 
entirely different situation 
than what is presented 
before me.

I propose that graduation 

is not like this. Our hype, 
our 
panic, 
our 
worry, 

our 
oh-my-god-what-

is-happening 
vibe 
is 

completely validated. I also 
propose that this transition 
manifests 
itself 
in 
our 

manic dinner reservations. 
Bear with me, I swear I 
have a point out of this 
ludicrous statement.

Over Thanksgiving Break, 

I remember talking with my 
mom about making dinner 
reservations for graduation 
weekend. I explained that 
the reason I was doing a 
less-than-stellar 
job 
at 

saving my minimum-wage 
paycheck was because I was 
“researching” restaurants 
for graduation weekend. 
We agreed that as soon as 
the restaurants would take 
reservations, I would make 
three, one for every night 
my family is coming out to 
Ann Arbor.

Winter Break, I couldn’t 

make the reservations.

Spring Break, I couldn’t 

make the reservations.

In all honesty, I came 

back from Spring Break, 
spent 
three 
days 
not 

checking to see if I could 
make 
reservations, 
and 

then decided to wait a more 
couple days before checking 
again. Two days later, I 
couldn’t 
make 
a 
single 

reservation 
(hyperbolic, 

I managed one on Friday 
night).

Like 
there 
was 
just 

one zebra carcass in the 
middle of the Serengeti, the 
vultures swooped in and 
devoured the innards and 
licked the black-and-white 
skin off their lips (in this 
metaphor, the reservation 
is the zebra and the seniors 
are the vultures).

Our 
hyped-up 
sense 

of 
nervousness 
about 

graduation 
transitioned 

into hyper-awareness about 
over 
planning. 
Planning 

for the one thing that we 
can, because we can’t plan 
for the feeling of throwing 
our hats up in the air and 
letting go of this place we 
call home.

I’m only slightly bitter 

that 
everything 
was 

booked. My mom prefers 
cooking at home anyway 
(healthier, cheaper, easier), 
and considering I have a 
kitchen in my apartment, it 
all works out for the better. 
Instead of rushing to make 
a reservation, everyone is 

welcome at my house for 
some baked salmon and 
roasted asparagus over a 
bed of quinoa. Or just some 
roasted chicken and frozen 
peas. Either way, it’s going 
to be with my family.

And either way, I’m going 

to graduate.

How 
to: 
Listen 
to 

your mom and make a 
reservation for graduation 
the first time she asks you.

1. You know you will feel 

better if you can check that 
off your mental to-do list

2. She’s usually always 

right.

3. That restaurant you 

really want to eat at will 
be booked within the next 
week anyway, right?

4. 
Ask 
them 
in 
the 

sweetest, sugar-coated tone 
you can if you can make a 
reservation.

5. If they say yes, smile 

and say you need a table 
for 16 in the middle of their 
dinner rush.

6. Congratulations, you 

won the game of life.

7. Re: your mom is always 

right.

8. If they say no, don’t 

lose faith.

9. Clear your throat, and 

call the next place on your 
list.

10. Repeat step nine as 

many times as necessary.

11. Your patio really isn’t a 

bad option, either.

12. Congratulations and 

have a good graduation 
weekend!

M

y dad used to read me Helen Palmer’s 
“Do You Know What I’m Going to 
Do Next Saturday” before bed. I 

remember falling asleep planning my own next 
Saturday. I guess I still do that today.

Do you know what I’m going to do next Saturday? 

Well sir … let me tell you. 

I’m gonna dive some dives no one ever dived before.
I’m going to walk up to a party and I’m gonna 

see a dude sitting on the porch smoking a Newport 
menthol cigarette. He will be tan and have a 
strong jaw line and an even stronger social media 
presence. In fact, right as I walk up, he will be 
checking the last of his available Snap stories.

I will march past him because confident people 

enter any party like they’re walking into their own 
living room. He’ll stop me.

Dude: “Who do you know here and what’s your 

favorite mid-2000s band?”

Me (with conviction): “Lagunitas Sucks, their 

Brown Sugga’ Substitute ale is so smooth.”

Dude: “What?”
Me: “It’s a craft beer brewed in California mainly. 

They have a distribution deal with Heineken, 
though, so they’re low-key selling out. I still fuck 
with the taste palate though.”

Dude: “That’s not what I as—”
Me: “Do you have a Juulpod I can borrow?”
The dude will be confused. He will politely 

brandish a Virginia Tobacco Juulpod. I will 
deny the juulpod with an exaggerated hand 
gesture.

Me: “I only rip coconut pods, sorry. Plus, I’m 

quitting. I shouldn’t.”

Dude: “Do you know anyone at this party?”
Me 
(suddenly 
flustered): 
“Umm, 
uhh, 

ummm.”

Me (no longer flustered, quoting Rust Cohle): 

“Look, man, this is a world where nothing is 
solved. You know, someone once told me time 
is a flat circle. Everything we’ve ever done 
or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and 
over again. So, yes, I know, and have known 
everyone in this party. Multiple times. Forever. 
Also, in this specific iteration of life, I know 
Steve. We were in psych discussion together, 
and my favorite band is Kanye. I don’t believe 
art is collaborative so you could say I’m morally 
opposed to bands. I like art though. Let me in 
the fucking party.”

Before he can say anything else I will use the 

lid of my PBR tall boy to push my glasses up the 
bridge of my nose and walk past him. I’m so 
disarming. I’ll see him later.

Then I’m going to ski on water

if I want to.
And I want to.
To my surprise, when I will walk past the 

dude I will come to a dusty red door, and when I 
walk past the dusty red door, with paint peeling 
off the bottom third of the frame, I will see a 
beautiful mural of an artistic interpretation 
of the cover of Shel Silverstein’s “The Giving 
Tree,” but with apples replaced with Redd’s 
Apple Ale. Also, to my surprise, when I open 
the red peeling door, I will realize that I have 
somehow traveled through a wormhole, and 
the wormhole has spit me out at Skeeps, on the 
third floor, and I am drinking a Corona and 
worrying about norovirus.

I will look down and see someone has spilled 

cranberry vodka on my mock turtleneck. It 
will likely have been that dude from before. I 
will not entirely understand who this guy is, 
but I still will make a mental note to punch 
him in the face the next time I see him. Then 
I will make a digital copy of that mental note. 
I’ll whip out my iPhone, which unfortunately 
sustained a pretty badly cracked screen 
somewhere in the wormhole, and will begin 
to type out “remember to punch handsome 
gatekeeper/arch nemesis/manifestation of self-
consciousness in the face.”

Coincidentally, in the exact moment, I finish 

typing my mental note into the notes section of 
my app titled “Thoughts to keep.” (A section that 
was stupidly placed right next to “Thoughts not 
to keep,” but that’s a problem for another time.) 
The same dude from the alternative dimension 
on the other side of the peeling red door will 
confront me. I didn’t know they made Henley’s 
that tight.

Dude: “What are you doing here?”
Did you ever box a United States Marine?
Well sir, I’m going to box a Marine next 

Saturday.

I won’t want to admit it, but part of me will 

know it’s time. You can’t run from yourself 
forever.

I will do a flying windmill kick and hit him in 

the face and as I do it the ninth song on More 
Life will come on, and we will both know I have 
won and the rest of my time at Skeeps will be 
pretty fun, and I’ll grab a slice of pizza on my 
way home.

A few hours later, I will wake up from a sleep 

so dark, it will feel like I was dead. My Twitter 
app will still be open and a dryness will run 
from the tip of my tongue to the back of my 
throat. Right before I fall back asleep I notice 
a slight tightness in my right thigh. I should 
stretch next time before I flying kick anyone.

Yes sir, that is what I’m going to do next Saturday.

Art Matters

proposed NEA elimination threatens performing arts community

b y Yo s h i k o I w a i, Deputy Statement Editor
I

t’s a Saturday night and the audi-

ence at the Power Center for 

the Performing Arts is stunned. 

Silence floods the walls of the the-

ater. I can almost hear the person 

next to me holding their breath. The stage I’ve 

performed on eight times since I started my 

dance training at the University of Michigan 

is tense and torn, like I’ve never experienced 

before. “Betroffenheit” by Kidd Pivot and 

Electric Company Theatre has the full house 

of 1,200 people in a standing ovation. Tears, 

shock and wonder fill the audience.

“Betroffenheit,” a theater-dance perfor-

mance, is a visual and physical representation 

of grief, addiction and trauma. Based on writer 

and performer Jonathan Young’s experience 

of losing his daughter and cousins to a fire, the 

combination of movement, sound and space 

is both arresting and thought-provoking. It’s 

the kind of physical, psychological and emo-

tional effect we as performing artists strive to 

achieve in our years of training — something 

that crosses the proscenium stage and perme-

ates the lives of the viewers — something that 

makes them question the world they inhabit.

Award-winning performances like “Betrof-

fenheit” are hard to come by. During middle 

school and high school, I saw some artists of 

this caliber during trips to New York City, but 

these world-class performances came with 

expensive tickets that made seeing everything 

I wanted unrealistic. My orchestra ticket to 

see “Betroffenheit” in Ann Arbor though, was 

$20.

***

This year alone, the University Musical 

Society — an Ann Arbor-based performing 

arts presenter affiliated with the University — 

brought multiple internationally recognized 

artists to campus. The night before “Betrof-

fenheit,” three-time Grammy award-winning 

jazz quasi-collective Snarky Puppy took Hill 

Auditorium. In early February, Ping Chong + 

Company, recipient of National Medal of Arts, 

did a theatrical performance on Muslim iden-

tity. Just a month before, Bessie Award-win-

ning Ohad Naharin’s Israeli dance company, 

Batsheva, performed at the Power Center. 

In January, UMS announced that current 

New York Philharmonic president, Matthew 

VanBesien, will be the next UMS president 

beginning this summer. Last November, the 

Grammy award-winning Berlin Philharmonic 

did an orchestral residency with University 

students.

Since its establishment in 1880, UMS pres-

ents approximately 75 performances a year 

and hosts more than 100 educational events 

per season. In 2015, UMS was the first uni-

versity-related arts presenter to receive the 

National Medal of Arts from then-President 

Barack Obama.

Looking back on these 138 years, the UMS 

line-up of performances is even more impres-

sive. Before his retirement, Leonard Bernstein 

conducted four performances in the country 

with the Vienna Philharmonic; Hill Audito-

rium was one of them. In 2001, UMS president 

Ken Fischer started a multi-year partnership 

with the Royal Shakespeare Company. And let 

us not forget that Yo-Yo Ma will be perform-

ing on campus this April. What’s most surpris-

ing is that students can see his performance 

for less than the cost of a dinner at any Main 

Street restaurant.

As a senior in high school applying to col-

leges, I researched the cities and local per-

formance venues of each of the schools I 

considered attending. Ann Arbor stood out to 

me. Not only was I drawn to the quality of the 

School of Music, Theatre & Dance’s curricu-

lum, but also the Ann Arbor arts environment 

itself. I considered conservatories in New 

York City and Los Angeles until I realized 

Ann Arbor offered the same opportunities — 

except here, I can go to a football game at noon 

and then an opera at night. Since I started my 

dance training at the University three years 

ago, I have seen and taken classes from artists 

I could maybe meet in New York City or Chi-

cago or Montreal or Israel. Maybe. Needless 

to say, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance 

School is nationally ranked along with the 

performing arts conservatories on the coasts.

This performing arts bubble — Ann Arbor 

— from education to exposure, is a Midwest-

ern gem for aspiring performers and the pub-

lic, according to Aaron Dworkin, dean of the 

Music, Theatre & Dance School.

“We’re a very unique place, as it relates to 

the arts,” Dworkin said. “We are solidly in the 

Midwest, yet we have arts experiences, train-

ing and institutions that rival anything on the 

coasts,” Dworkin said. “We are in many ways 

in that center — whether it’s a presenter like 

UMS, whether it’s our school and the fact that 

we lead the nation in so many of our depart-

ments.”

*****

Last Thursday, the Trump administration 

released a proposed federal budget calling 

for the complete defunding of the National 

Endowment for the Arts and the National 

Endowment for the Humanities. Public fund-

ing for the arts had long been a low-hanging 

fruit for fiscal hawks — even though the annu-

al cost of $741 million composes less than one-

tenth of a percent of federal spending. But this 

announcement marks the first time in history 

that a sitting administration proposed to dis-

continue either the NEA or NEH.

The NEA is an independent federal agency 

founded by Congress in 1965. The organiza-

tion provides financial support to arts organi-

zations and projects across the country. Over 

the years, the organization has expanded its 

aid from performances and educational expe-

riences to even health-care projects, like the 

NEA Healing Arts Partnership. Founded in 

2011, the partnership works to promote arts 

therapy, placing art therapists in veteran hos-

pitals across the nation.

Every year, the NEA funds various Music, 

Theatre & Dance School research projects and 

performances. The George and Ira Gershwin 

Critical Edition — an ongoing scholarly analy-

sis of Gershwin’s music — and Youth & Adult 

Community Programs — an educational pro-

gram that exposes local Ann Arbor residents 

to different performances — to name a few 

who receive funds.

In 2016, the NEA awarded UMS with 

$30,000 to bring performances, residencies 

and other educational programs to Ann Arbor. 

“Betroffenheit” was one of them — in addition 

to the American Ballet Theatre, Camille A. 

Brown, Taylor Mac and others.

The proposed cuts were announced mere 

minutes before I was to interview the dean 

and assistant dean of the Music, Theatre & 

Dance School. When we sat down, it was clear 

they were still digesting the potential loss of 

the NEA.

Dean Aaron Dworkin, a member of the 

National Council for the Arts, which makes 

recommendations for individuals and organi-

zations to be awarded the National Medal of 

Arts — the presidential award for outstanding 

artists — said he is unsure of the effects of the 

proposed budget, as it awaits a lengthy con-

gressional revision process. He emphasized, 

however, the proposed budget suggests a lack 

of value placed on the arts in American soci-

ety.

“Budgets are moral documents,” Dworkin 

said. “Budgets reflect the values of an institu-

tion or the values of a nation.”

That same day, I interviewed UMS Presi-

dent Ken Fischer, who was visibly disturbed 

when we met. He argued the proposed budget 

is motivated by ideology and not a genuine 

desire to balance the budget.

“There seems to be no understanding of the 

role the NEA has been playing,” he said. “It 

gives grants that could maybe total the wing 

of a defense jet, but look at what it does to 

bring a quality of life to this country. UMS has 

received funding each year from the NEA. It 

is an important part of our budget, but what 

it is more than anything, is a statement that 

our country cares that the arts are important.”

However, he stresses to look at the opportu-

nity the crisis brings, that “artists will rise to 

fill the vacuum that is created by the potential 

loss of the NEA.”

Dworkin and Melody Racine, SMTD senior 

associate dean for academic affairs, also 

struck a defiant tone, emphasizing that with 

lost federal funding, it would be their respon-

sibility to further provide platforms for artists 

to continue their craft.

“We must be artist citizens now,” Racine 

said. “We need to be very good at what we do 

in the arts, but we need to also be very aware 

of what’s happening in the political world. 

We need to be very aware of what’s happen-

ing with our planet. We need to be very aware 

with issues of diversity, equity and inclusion. 

The more we know about outside our own 

field, the better ours becomes.”

The 
educational, 
administrative 
and 

entrepreneurial drive of the administration 

reassures me as an Music, Theatre & Dance 

student. Even if the discontinuation of pub-

lic arts funding doesn’t survive the budget 

review process, it’s hard not to interpret the 

proposal as saying “the arts don’t matter.”

My attitude is not alone among Music, 

Theatre & Dance students. Spencer Schaefer, 

a Music, Theatre & Dance junior studying 

French horn performance and ethnomusicol-

ogy, emphasized that he pursues his craft not 

for future potential wealth but for the sake of 

art.

“I think a lot of people are unaware of what 

it means to be an artist because they see dance, 

they see installations, they see artwork, they 

hear music, but don’t understand the time it 

takes, and what it means to someone,” he said. 

“These people aren’t cashing out and making 

tons of money off of this, no. This is putting 

a roof over their heads so they can continue 

to create their project — and maybe, they can 

come back and eat something.”

*****

In a country where the performing arts 

are implicitly underappreciated, the role of 

the performing artist becomes more complex. 

There is no option to stop — if this is the lan-

guage I’ve used for 18 years, there’s no forget-

ting it or learning a new one now.

When I look back on “Betroffenheit” and 

wonder why it affected me the way it did, 

I can’t come up with words to accurately 

describe the movement, or search for some-

thing in a thesaurus to find one that’ll fit. I 

tried.

When a performance does its job, it gives 

you the unutterable. It describes the space 

between your mind and your hands that des-

perately try to explain the sensation of an 

experience whether it is good or bad.

Schaefer agreed when we spoke about the 

role of the emerging performing artist.

“Even if I’m not going to make a dime off my 

art, that doesn’t mean it can’t impact someone 

and it still means something to me,” Schaefer 

said. “I’ll find a way to put a roof over my head, 

it’s never about that. I think that’s why the art 

is going to keep going. It’s so crushing to see 

that it could get more and more distant with 

the lack of funding from it, within the pop cul-

ture and main culture of society.”

This argument is reinforced by faculty. The 

word “quit” simply does not exist in the art-

ist’s vocabulary.

“The best thing that we can do is to learn, 

prepare, train, become great artists,” Dworkin 

said. “The best thing you can do when the arts, 

or whatever field you’re working in is poten-

tially diminished or under threat, is to become 

more excellent — to make a better argument 

for it. I’ve learned to not to predict the future, 

but project and prepare. Because luck is when 

preparation meets opportunity.”

But I don’t know how I could have prepared 

for this. The proposed budget’s complete dis-

missal of the arts has made me question my 

craft and therefore identity. How do I tell my 

graduating friends that everything will be 

OK when the already minimal support for the 

starving artists is completely gone?

It’s less of a question of whether the arts 

matter — of course, they do. The question is 

how the aspiring, still unknown artist enters 

a world where their existence is undervalued. 

The dialogue starts sounding a lot like other 

conversations that have surfaced in the recent 

political climate.

*****

As a violinist, multi-media artist and now 

an educator, Dworkin’s resilience is some-

thing I admire.

“From my perspective, there is no doubt,” 

Dworkin said, his voice unwavering. “It’s just 

that we have to make the case and make the 

argument, because the arts pervade so much of 

what we do — it’s just not recognized amongst 

many people how pervasive the arts are, and 

that the arts require training and facility. It’s 

not like you can magically play an instrument 

or sing or dance, it requires years of training, 

development, craft, ingenuity and creativity.”

Over the course of the last few days, this 

pervasiveness of the arts has been a recurring 

theme. Even as a performing artist in school 

with other performing artists, I sometimes 

lose sight of the breadth of this field. Fischer 

doesn’t.

“This will be one where I hope anyone who 

has been to a theater, dance or music perfor-

mance, who owns an iPad, or an iPhone, and 

looks at the design, who drives a car, thinks: 

Who are the people designing these things 

that have made America great?” Fischer said. 

“They are people who have been artists and 

designers. For anyone to think it’s just a bunch 

of rich people going to see the Metropolitan 

Opera benefitting from this, they need to get 

their facts straight.”

The potential demise of the NEA and with 

it, the national support system for the arts, not 

only affects current artists, but future genera-

tions of artists as well. Whether they are in 

training like me, or haven’t yet picked up the 

violin or paintbrush, the lack of access to the 

arts has foreseeable consequences.

I know for a fact that I would not have pur-

sued a college degree in this craft if I weren’t 

exposed to choreographers and dancers who 

made my jaw drop and entire body tingle when 

I was younger — I simply wouldn’t have pur-

sued it if I didn’t experience the full-blown, 

unadulterated power of the artist myself. I 

wanted to communicate the unutterable.

The experience of the arts is irreplaceable. 

If I’ve learned anything from 18 years of train-

ing, it’s that live art is fleeting, but maybe for 

the same reason, most resonating. It seems 

most lively in the sense that it requires your 

fullest attention in the moment, to be stored 

in your memory, as more of a sensation than 

artifact. After all, it is an experience.

Personal Statement: A Place to Call Home

I 

never expected to go to the Uni-
versity of Michigan.

I grew up in a small town in the 

middle of a cornfield (also known 
as southwest Michigan) and 

graduated in a class of 59 students. There, 
college isn’t “expected” by any means. The 
town I grew up in has a population of rough-
ly 1,500 people and is primarily dominated 
by agriculture and factory work.

It’s the kind of place that doesn’t offer AP 

classes, but does offer a consumer’s math 
course (basically we learned how to finance 
a house and do our taxes — “real-life” math, 
if that’s what you want to call it). We didn’t 
have any college-prep classes like calculus. 
The kids who did want to go to college — the 
few that there were — were not exposed to 
the rigorous curriculum that prepares stu-
dents for schools like the University.

Many of my peers entered the workforce 

straight out of high school, per usual. It’s 
more uncommon for kids in my town to go 
to four-year universities than it is to get a job 
and buy a house.

Because of this, I tried to keep most of my 

college endeavors under wraps. Friends and 
family members knew I wanted to go to col-
lege, but they didn’t really know where I was 
thinking of applying. The general consensus 
for most education-oriented students was 
community college. For a long time, that’s 
where I thought I would end up.

At some point during my senior year, 

though, I started applying everywhere, 
including schools with out-of-state, private 
price tags. I didn’t apply because I thought I 
would go to the schools I was applying to, but 
just because I wanted to see where I would 
get in. I had the grades, the ACT scores and 
extracurriculars, but I came from a little 
Midwest town in the middle of nowhere. I 
wasn’t getting into the University.

So you can imagine the conflict of emo-

tions I had when I received a big envelope 
in the mail with the word “Congratulations” 
sprawled across the top. I wasn’t exactly 
thrilled to be accepted to the University 
of Michigan, mostly because a part of me 
hoped I wouldn’t get in.

It sounds stupid, but I knew I wouldn’t be 

able to attend a school with a price tag like 
the University’s. It almost hurt to be accept-
ed and know that I couldn’t go. I had tossed 
the idea of going to school here out the win-
dow at the same time I submitted the appli-
cation.

I hadn’t considered attending the Univer-

sity as a legitimate option, so now that the 
opportunity was open to me, I didn’t really 
know what to think. Kids like me who come 
from towns like mine generally don’t even 
apply to schools like the University, let alone 

get in. I hadn’t been on a visit, I didn’t know 
how I would major in nursing at a school 
that people call “a public Ivy,” and I was 
lacking in the math and science background 
that I would need.

Ultimately, though, I decided to go. I 

can’t really explain how it happened — one 
second, I had given up any shred of an idea 
that I would go to school here, and the next 
(which was conveniently the last day to reg-
ister), I was enrolled at the University. I had 
received financial aid and scholarships that 
covered all of the costs, which I think was a 
driving factor in the decision.

But there was something about unan-

swered potential that really made me want 
to branch out and go somewhere I had never 
even been before. So I enrolled.

I didn’t tell my family about my deci-

sion for a while, in particular because they 
weren’t thrilled about the idea of me going 
to college in the first place. My parents have 
always been a little disengaged in the pro-
cess, especially after my brother graduated 
high school. It’s hard to explain, but basi-
cally I was verified as an “unaccompanied 
homeless youth” in high school.

I moved in with my brother during my 

sophomore year. I worked two jobs and paid 
for my own clothes, car, groceries and bills. 
Neither one of my parents had been there for 
me through the application process, so I did 
it by myself.

Needless to say, it was pretty clear from 

the beginning that if I decided to go to 
school, I’d be responsible for footing the bill. 
What I didn’t expect was the support that 
the University gave me with my finances. 
Once I realized I would have 
the funds to go, it seemed like a 
prime opportunity to be a first-
generation college student.

Looking back on it now, it 

wasn’t easy being self-sufficient 
in high school. But in the long 
run, I appreciate the lack of 
support I had at such a crucial 
point in my life. It taught me to 
be independent and responsible 
in times where I shouldn’t have 
to have been, and nothing has 
prepared me more for my time 
at the University.

What I wasn’t ready for was 

how difficult it would be to go 
through college without a tra-
ditional support system. It’s 
frustrating — so unbelievably 
frustrating — to not have the 
support that I felt other stu-
dents had. As a first-generation 
student who was alienated at 
the start of my college career, I 

consistently felt I was lacking support.

My family doesn’t really know the norms 

of college, and I feel like I’ve missed out on 
a lot because of that. Care packages haven’t 
ever been a thing, nor will they ever be. I 
don’t get phone calls from my parents asking 
about my exams because they don’t remem-
ber when they are. There’s never been an 
interest in my writing for the Daily, or for 
attending a football game with me or seeing 
campus.

At risk of sounding like an angsty 20-year-

old, I want to clarify that it’s not that my 
parents want me to fail in life — they’re my 
parents, they obviously don’t. But they don’t 
see college for what it is, and that’s an oppor-
tunity for me to build on my potential. And 
it seems that no matter how much time I 
spend here, or how much work I put in, it’ll 
just be considered a waste of time.

So despite the lack of background 

knowledge in math or Spanish or what-
ever academic challenges I may have 
faced that first semester freshman year 
(and continue to face), those weren’t my 
biggest obstacles coming into college. I 
didn’t have a support system to fall back 
on.

That hurt most when my roommates 

were calling their moms for medical 
advice, or when they needed a shoulder 
to cry on after a hard exam or when their 
families would come to visit. It’s why I 
feel uncomfortable around my friends’ 
families — not because I’m envious or bit-
ter, but because I don’t know how those 
things are supposed to work.

If you’re like me, and your family 

doesn’t back you up as often as you wish 
they would, the best thing you can do 
is find a place that provides you with a 
makeshift family. I got a taste of that with 
my two roommates freshman year (lucky, 
I know). But really, the place where I 
found the most comfort was the Daily.

It sounds like such a plug and so 

cheesy, but it’s true. I don’t know if it’s 
because we never stop covering events or 
publishing stories so it seems like a con-
stant presence, but the Daily is my home. 
It’s like being a part of a sports team. The 
older students have mentored me, and 
picked me up when I’ve been down. The 
people I’ve met have done so much for me 
on an unbelievable scale, and I’m not sure 
they know it.

But even with the support I’ve learned 

in college, I still face challenges when I 
go home. As a second-semester sopho-
more, my dad still asks me if I am plan-
ning to graduate. It’s like a surprise that 
I’ve stuck it out this long, and even more 
surprising that I plan on staying.

If I had a dollar for every time someone 

implied that I couldn’t graduate from col-
lege, I’d probably have enough money to 
pay the University’s tuition without any 
financial aid.

Long story short, everyone has a differ-

ent path to Ann Arbor. For some, it might 
be as simple as counting to 10. But for 
me, it changed my life. It taught me to go 
beyond expectations and to try things I 
never thought I would ever be able to try, 
and I feel like that’s kind of what college 
is all about.

Personal Statement: Three Days in Carabao

A

s I sat in the small boat at about 
8 in the morning, paddling the 
dingy forward, my “guide,” 
Carabao Island-native Willy 
Mendoza, signaled to pull on 

my swimming goggles. The skinny canoe was 
not much longer than a ping-pong table and 
thinner than a kayak but balanced with two 
beams that extended out like wings.

About 40 meters offshore, Willy and I had 

just cast a lengthy fishing net across the ocean 
floor in a massive semicircular path. Our first 
fishing attempt of the day — my first ever in this 
manner — would be wildly successful.

One of Willy’s sons dove off the boat first, and 

I watched him as he flapped his arms and legs, 
smacking the water. Willy instructed that Park-
er (another American boy I was traveling with) 
and I do the same. I pulled down my goggles 
and slid down off the boat. After a deep breath, 
I sank under, and understood the simple, yet 
effective, fishing tactic that the Mendoza family 
had mastered for years.

Beneath the surface, I watched through 

the clear water as Willy and his oldest son, 
Christian, frightened fish in every direction. 
The sounds of kicking legs and arms splashing 
scared fish, and by working together, the father 
and son maneuvered a handful of fish toward 
the net, which would eventually catch their 
gills.

That was only the first attempt. For the 

next 20 minutes, Parker and I joined in, kick-
ing, splashing, breathing and repeating. The 
sea floor was lined with starfish, coral and sea 
grass, and above it swam fish of all sizes and 
colors. We caught them all until we had enough 
stuck in the net to come back to the boat.

Back in the canoe, we pulled in the net, 

untangling each fish and throwing it in a bucket.

“When net gets heavy, stop,” Willy told me.
Willy’s English was limited, but I under-

stood. Whenever the net began to feel heavy, 
it was usually caught on the coral on the ocean 
floor. This happened often, and when it did, 
one of the Filipinos put on wooden flippers and 
swam down to the floor to untangle it.

I watched from just below the surface as they 

dove down, sometimes holding their breath for 
45 seconds at a time, fiddling away at the thin 
wires to release the net from the coral.

We continued pulling the net in until we 

finally hauled up the rock attached to one end 
that anchored it in place.

About 20 fish in total. In my whole life of rod-

and-bait fishing, I had never caught half that 
number. Twice more we cast the net, scared 
fish into it and pulled it in to find our method 
was equally successful.

After getting back to shore, we brought in the 

bucket full of fish, and for the remainder of the 
day that comprised our lunch and dinner. Fish, 

chicken and rice were the most common. Wil-
ly’s wife prepared a type of fresh sashimi, tak-
ing bits of the raw fish and sticking them in lime 
juice to kill bacteria. We also ate octopus, pork, 
clams and squid with black ink still on it.

Our catch, along with other chicken and pork 

they raised near their home, would feed Willy, 
his wife, and their seven kids for two days, and 
then they would untangle the net and fish again.

Such is life on Carabao, a remote island far 

away on its own in the Philippines. With a 
population of just more than 10,000, “isolated” 
is an understatement of its location. Parker and 
I made up two of about seven tourists on the 
island that week. During the summer it gets a 
little busier, but there are few traces of Western 
influence.

There is one hospital, but it has no doctors. 

Electricity shuts off at 8:00 p.m. every night, 
and for most of the island’s population, the sun-
set means the day is over.

We had met Willy the day before. After kaya-

king for about 30 minutes, Parker and I came 
across a beach where kids were playing. As we 
paddled to shore, the kids waved and we said 
hello and we saw Willy laying out the net on 
his front lawn. We introduced ourselves, and 
he graciously offered us coconuts, which he 
chopped open right before us, and invited us to 
sit down.

“Are you going fishing?” we asked.
“8 a.m. tomorrow,” Willy replied.

He welcomed us to come along, and we 

returned promptly the next morning. While 
net-fishing far away in the Philippines felt like a 
day activity for me, it was just part of the routine 
for the Mendozas, and many others that live in 
Carabao.

After lunch, we motorbiked over to the chick-

en fights for the afternoon. At least 100 people, 
all men, were watching and betting. Along with 
cliff jumping, snorkeling and exploring bat 
caves, three days in Carabao were filled with 
incredible memories. But what has stuck with 
me the most was our last meal with Willy later 
than night.

As we sat with Willy for dinner, just as the 

electricity went out, we asked him about his 
home.

He told us he had built it himself, 23 years 

ago, when he was in his early 20s. In front of the 
house, a lawn led to the water. Out back, a paddy 
was filled with chickens, cats and a dog. To the 
side, a canopy covered the dinner table.

The static of an old box television could be 

heard from outside, and walking up the con-
crete steps to the door, we briefly looked inside 
his four-room home. About the size of an aver-
age high-school classroom, the floors were 
made of concrete and stone. I remember only 
four bamboo beds — no mattresses, pillows, 
sheets or anything. Just flat bamboo beds.

I’d met so many people that day. From Willy’s 

family and friends to strangers in the town and 

at the chicken fight, and they all had greeted me 
so kindly. Willy’s family, all nine of them, fed me 
and showed me a day in their lives.

My entire day was filled with a spontane-

ous agenda I couldn’t have anywhere else in 
the world, but for Willy, it was a regular Thurs-
day, and he was so happy the whole time. From 
morning to evening, he smiled, and we laughed 
at dinner. And in his home, this small home, on 
these four bamboo beds, lived nine people. The 
oldest, Willy, was 46, and the youngest child, a 
daughter, was not yet 2 years old.

It was so different. Four bamboo beds rested 

on concrete floors, and the only light came from 
a battery flashlight they used to show me and 
Parker around. It was uncomfortable, and odd, 
to be honest. Spending a whole day with some-
one, seeing them as so happy and joyful and 
then learning the conditions they live in are so 
drastically different.

So I just looked, because I didn’t know what 

else to do.

I don’t think I’ll ever see Willy again, 

and I don’t know if I’ll ever go to Philip-
pines again, but I’ll always be grateful to 
the Mendoza family for the incredible, 
and different, experience they gave to me.

The next morning, I woke up on my 

bed — mattress, sheets and a pillow — and 
Parker and I boated back to meet the rest 
of our group that hadn’t followed us to 
Carabao.

For my entire life, my mother has been a church organist. This gave me 
unique access as a child to rows of pews to lounge in and sanctuaries to 
explore while she practiced on the organ. I have always appreciated this 

uninhibited access to sacred spaces, but I was only able to fully appreciate 
my mother’s talent as a musician when I got older. These pictures are an ode 
to her music and the stunning space it inhabits at Westminster Presbyterian 

Church in Grand Rapids.
