A CHARITABLE STROLL

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
'U' creates
first stem
cell lines
for disease

Lines for study
of hemophilia B,
Charcot-Marie-
Tooth disease
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Embryos that once had to be
thrown away are now contribut-
ing to the understanding of how
genetic diseases progress and the
development of new treatments.
On Monday, University
researchers announced that
they have successfully created
the state's first disease-specific
human embryonic stem cell
lines. The stem cells contain the
genes responsible for the genetic
disorders hemophilia B, which is
responsible for insufficient blood
clotting, and Charcot-Marie-
Tooth disease, which causes
muscle degeneration.
"These stem cell lines are
the first of their kind," said

Gary Smith, a co-director of
the University's Consortium for
Stem Cell Therapies, where the
research is being conducted.
No other researchers have
created lines for these particular
diseases, Smithsaid. The main
goal of the University research-
ers' current project is to derive
unique embryonic stem cell lines
and to provide scientists across
the country with new ways of
studying the formation of spe-
cific diseases to devise cures for
them.
"By better understanding the
disease, you're better able to
treat the disease," Smith said.
Sue O'Shea, the consortium's
co-director, explained that
embryonic stem cells offer a
model to study the development
of a genetic disease. By studying
embryonic stem cells, research-
ers can track the development
of abnormal cells and examine
how they affect the growth and
health of the cell, she said.

Biden announces
policy for colleges
to follow Title IX
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
In light of new sexual vio-
lence prevention guidelines
released by the U.S. Department

of Education's Office for Civil
Rights, the University's Sexual
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center is looking to build
upon its already nationally rec-
ognized program.
Vice President Joe Biden
announced the new guidelines
in a speech at the University of
New Hampshire on Monday.
Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan said in a press confer-

ence call on Monday that the
guidelines provide a structure
for how colleges and schools
should handle sexual violence.
However, a SAPAC official said
the University is already func-
tioning in accordance with fed-
eral instruction.
In an April 4 White House
press release, Biden wrote that
the new guidelines will help col-
leges and universities improve

the ways they deal with sexual
assault.
"Students across the coun-
try deserve the safest possible
environment in which to learn,"
Biden wrote. "That's why we're
taking new steps to help our
nation's schools, universities
and colleges end the cycle of
sexual violence on campus."
The new guidelines are

'Rant' will explore
ways to improve
campus
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Without prodding, students
often complain about certain
aspects of the University. And

now, the University is encourag-
ing these grievances, specifically
about North Campus.
As part of the North Campus
Initiative started by E. Royster
Harper, the University's vice
president of student affairs, stu-
dents are invited to participate in
a forum called "The North Cam-
pus Rant: The Good, The Bad,
and The Dude!" The event, that
will be held tonight, will allow

students to voice their opinions
on what's working and what
could be improved on North
Campus. The goals of the North
Campus Initiative are twofold: to
find ways to draw more students
to North Campus and to improve
the experience for students who
already frequent the campus.
Harper told students at a fire-
side chat at the Northwood Com-

Daily StaffReporter
After finishing his free
breakfast from St. Andrew's
Episcopal Church, Jeff Sharp
reciprocates by helping to wash

the dishes, as he's done every-
day for the past five years.
Sharp is one of about150 peo-
ple who visit the local church
between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m.
each day for breakfast. Since
Aug. 16, 1982, St. Andrew's,
located on North Division
Street, has been serving the
homeless and needy seven days
a week and offering educational
programs on a weekly basis.
St. Andrew's Deacon Svea

Gray said the program was cre-
ated in hopes of meeting the
increased need for food assis-
tance inthe communitybecause
of the ;economic downturn in
the 1980s. Serving a meal is a
simple way to give back, she
said.
"We've had it outside, at dif-
ferent churches when things
are going on, but we've never
missed a morning since 1982,"

Engineering public art

Where are you from originally?
I was born in Pakistan, but came to
New York at a very young age. I was
two years old, so I grew up in New
York.
Where did you go to college?
Undergraduate was at Colum-
bia University, where I got a B.S. in
mechanicalengineering, and my grad-
uate was at the University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles where I got an M.F.A.
What classes do you teach here?
I typically will be teaching more
of the foundations classes, and then I
will be teachinga class with a profes-
sor in computer science called "Cre-
ative Computation." And currently
I'm teaching a class called "Where Art
Thou: Creative Practice Outside of the
White Cube."

What kind of art do you do?
It would fall into public work -
what they call contextual practice,
installation, and sculpture. It would
be work that's not inside a white cube.
It's meant to be kind of put into the
public sphere ... but it's not necessarily
the public sculptures you'd see around
campus. It's much more, I would say,
more experienced based. You use sort
of structures, permanent structures.
What do you hope to conveywith
your art?
A rule of art is to kind of draw a
critical reflection to the everyday, and
in a way, that's how I see my work as
well. When I say critical I don't mean
it to be negative, just a way to reflect
on the issues and being of the every-
day, notions of identity, or public/pri-

vate space, economics.
What do you hope your students
get out of your classes?
Well for me, I think the idea for
students is to kind of explore and find
their own passion and potential. And
of course the classes are sort of themed
around a certain idea, so my goal is to
expose them to new ways of thinking
and new ways of trying and explor-
ing art making or creative making.
But really for me, it's been for them to
come to their own realization of their
own interests or their own potentials,
or their own passions - again, in the
medium of creative activity. So art in
that sense is very much about people
finding their own passions and me just
mentoring that part.

Ivory Coast strongman
says e won't step down t

Laurent Gbagbo
takes shelter in
residence bunker
as protests rage
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -
Ivory Coast's strongman leader
Laurent Gbagbo holed up in a
bunker inside the presidential
residence yesterday, defiantly
maintaining he won the election
four months ago even as troops
backing the internationally rec-
ognized winner encircled the
home.
Gbagbo's comments by tele-
phone to France's LCI television
came as French officials and a
diplomat said he was negotiating
his departure terms after French
and U.N. forces launched a mili-
tary offensive Monday. Demo-
cratically elected leader Alassane
Ouattara has urged his support-

ers to take Gbagbo alive.
Talks about Gbagbo's depar-
ture terms were ongoing yester-
day evening directly between
Gbagbo and Ouattara, according
to a diplomat who spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because he was
not authorized to speak publicly.
Choi Young-jin, the U.N.'s top
envoy in Ivory Coast, said yester-
day that Gbagbo was in discus-
sions about where he would go,
possibly suggesting the strong-
man may be willing to consider
stepping down after more than a
decade in power.
When asked by The Associated
Press Television News if he was
confident that Gbagbo has decid-
ed to leave, Choi said:
"Yes, because as far as I know
the key elements they are negoti-
ating is where Mr. Gbagbo would
go"
"Mr. Gbagbo has signaled for
the first time since the crisis, he
will accept the will of the people,

the results of the election," Choi
said.
France's foreign minister said
Gbagbo would be required to
relinquish power in writing after
a decade as president, and must
formally recognize Ouattara, the
internationally backed winner
of the November election that
plunged the West African nation
into chaos.
But Gbagbo showed no inten-
tion of leaving, declaring in his
interview with French television,
that Ouattara "did not win the
elections" even though he was
declared the victor by the U.N.,
African Union, United States,
former colonial power France
and other world leaders.
"I won the election and I am
not negotiating my departure,"
Gbagbo said by telephone. The
French channel said the inter-
view was conducted by phone
from his residence at 1730 GMT,
and lasted about 20 minutes.

DEA head says Mexican drug
cartels impact the entire world

Other countries
concerned about
wave of violence
CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -
Countries around the world are
concerned about the increasingly
global reach of Mexican drug
cartels, the head of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration said
yesterday.
The United States is particu-
larly worried about the spread of
Los Zetas, a vicious Mexican gang
blamed for the killing of a U.S.
immigration agent in February
and the massacre of 72 migrants
in northern Mexico lastyear, DEA
administrator Michele M. Leon-
hart said at the opening of the

annual International Conference
for Drug Control.
The more than 100 countries
participating in the conference
face many of the same challenges
as the cartels grow in capacity and
sophistication, Leonhart said.
"We are always concerned
about the Mexican drug cartels
and the influence that they have,"
she said.
Leonhart said those gathered
support Mexican President Felipe
Calderon's offensive against the
cartels and "want to be part of the
solution."
Drug violence has killed more
than 34,600 people since Mex-
ico's crackdown began in late
2006.
The annual conference, started
by the DEA in 1983, is designed to
0

provide a united front on combat-
ting drug trafficking.
Discussing South America's
problems with cocaine traffickers,
Adm. Alvaro Echandia, the com-
mander of Colombia's navy, told
reporters his country no longer is
the only one encountering semi-
submersible submarines built to
move drugs.
Since the seizure of such a ves-
sel in Ecuador last year, authori-
ties now know they are being
manufactured in a wider area of
South America to avoid detection
in Colombia. But Echandia said
his country has good cooperation
with Ecuador, Peru and Chile for
uncovering the illegal operations,
which he said work almost like

Federal budget
fight could halt
gov't. operations
WASHINGTON (AP) - Prod-
ded by an insistent President
Barack Obama, Congress' top
two lawmakers sought to rein-
vigorate compromise talks yes-
terday aimed at cutting tens of
billions in federal spending and
averting a partial government
shutdown Friday at midnight.
There was at least a hint
of flexibility, accompanied by
sharply partisan attacks and an
outburst of shutdown brinks-
manship.
According to Democrats,
House Speaker John Boehner,
R-Ohio, suggested at a White
House meeting that fellow
Republicans might be able to
accept a deal with $40 billion
in cuts. That's more than nego-
tiators had been eyeing but less
than the House seeks.
The speaker's office declined
comment, and Boehner issued a
statement saying, "We can still

avoid a shutdown, but Demo-
crats are going to need to get
serious about cutting spending
- and soon."
For his part, Senate Major-
ity leader Harry Reid sounded
an accusatory note. "I hope the
Republicans do what the coun-
try needs, not what they believe
the tea party wants," he said at
the Capitol
"I mean, it seems that every
step we take, it's something just
to poke us in the eye," he said.
Obama stepped forcefully
into the dispute, at times sound-
ing like an exasperated parent.
He convened a meeting at the
White House with the chief con-
gressional antagonists, rejected
a Republican proposal for an
interim bill with sharp cuts and
then announced Boehner and
Reid would meetlater in the day.
If they can't sort out their dif-
ferences, he said, "I want them
back here tomorrow."
And if that doesn't work, he
added, "we'll invite them again
the day after that. And I will
have my entire team available to
work through the details of get-

ting a deal done."
Obama, eager to regain the
confidence of independent vot-
ers as he seeks a new term, said
the American public expects
that its leaders "act like grown-
ups, and when we are in nego-
tiations like this, that everybody
gives a little bit, compromises a
little bit in order to do the peo-
ple's business."
At issue is legislation needed
to keep the government run-
ning through the Sept. 30 end of
the budget year, and a desire by
all sides to avoid being blamed
politically if there is a shut-
down.
Twin closures in the mid-
1990s boomeranged on Repub-
licans when Newt Gingrich was
speaker, helping Bill Clinton
win re-election in 1996.
This year, both the White
House and lawmakers have
used the threat of a shutdown to
seek leverage in the talks.
Republicans issued a 13-page
pamphlet during the day pro-
viding guidance to congressio-
nal offices on operations during
a shutdown.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Congress votes
to repeal part of
healthcare law
Congress sent the White
House its first rollback of last
year's health care law yesterday, a
bipartisan repeal of a burdensome
tax reporting requirement that's
widely unpopular with business-
es. Even President Barack Obama
is eager to see it gone.
The Senate voted 87 to 12 to
repeal the filing requirement,
which would have forced mil-
lions of businesses to file tax
forms for every vendor selling
them more than $600 in goods
each year, starting in 2012. The
filing requirement is unrelated
to health care. However, it would
have been used to pay for part of
the new health law.
Republicans hope it is the first
of many such bills, resulting in
the entire health care law being
scrapped. Democrats say the bill
is part of an inevitable tinkering
that will be needed to improve the
health measure.

Equador expels
U.S. ambassador
Ecuador said yesterday it is
expelling the U.S. ambassador
over a diplomatic cable divulged
by WikiLeaks that accuses a
newly retired police chief of a
long history of corruption and
speculates that President Rafael
Correa was aware of it.
Foreign Minister Ricardo
Patino announced Ambassador
Heather Hodges' expulsion at a
news conference.
Patino said the ambassador,
called to his office the previous
afternoon, had not explained
what led her to suggest in the
2009 cable that Correa knew of
"supposed acts of corruption by
members of the police leadership
and more specifically the former
commander of the institution,
Jaime Hurtado Vaca."
GENEVA
Record ozone loss
seen this winter
The depletion of the ozone
layer shielding Earth from dam-
aging ultraviolet rays has reached
an unprecedented low over the
Arctic this spring because of
harmful chemicals and a cold
winter, the U.N. weather agency
said yesterday.
The Earth's fragile ozone layer
in the Arctic region has suffered a
loss of about 40 percent from the
start of winter until late March,
exceeding the previous season-
al loss of about 30 percent, the
World Meteorological Organiza-
tion said.
The Geneva-based agency
blamed the loss on a buildup of
ozone-eating chemicals once
widely used as coolants and fire
retardants in a variety of appli-
ances and on very cold tempera-

tures in the stratosphere, the
second major layer of the Earth's
atmosphere, just above the tropo-
sphere.

Scientists hope to
double or triple gas
production
GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) -
New scientific research has a
pair of energy companies betting
that the future of the U.S. natu-
ral gas industry lies in persuad-
ing microorganisms to treat old
coal deposits like all-you-can eat
buffets.
Coal, researchers have found,
is full of microbes that consume
the fossil fuel and break it down
into methane gas. Two compa-
nies want to take advantage of
this naturally occurring phe-
nomenon on a large scale to cre-
ate vast amounts of natural gas
in energy-rich places like Wyo-
ming.
"Once you figure out the rec-
ipe that feeds the bugs and gets
them reactivated, it's pretty
simple," said Bob Cavnar, chief
executive of Luca Technolo-
gies.
Luca and Ciris Energy have
begun experimenting with
using this type of microbe-
friendly formula in gas wells
drilled into coal deposits years
ago. The companies have been
spiking the wells with sub-
stances including calcium,
magnesium, phosphate and
glycerol, which encourage the
micro-organisms to reproduce,
feed and release the coveted
methane gas.
The hope is to get old and
nearly tapped-out coal-bed
methane wells to double or per-
haps triple gas production.
The process works on a
smaller scale, said Michael
Urynowicz, a researcher at the
University of Wyoming who has
studied using microbes to turn
coal into methane.
"The question is, at the field
scale, how economically viable it

will be?" he said.
Some worry it will con-
taminate the groundwater
that supplies more than 6,000
area homes. What Luca calls
"nutrients," Jill Morrison of the
Powder River Basin Resource
Council calls "chemicals."
"They make it sound like it's
yogurt and granola or some-
thing. It's not," Morrison said.
"I'm not saying that maybe this
technology doesn't have some
promise at some point. But I
don't think we're there, and we
don't know enough about it."
The experiment comes in the
midst of a natural gas boom that
has seen companies in several
states just begin to tap vast gas
deposits only now being recog-
nized for their enormous poten-
tial.
To many, those reserves look
all the more attractive while the
Japanese nuclear crisis raises
worries about nuclear energy
and the Gulf oil spill casts doubt
on tapping the nation's best
remaining oil deposits.
Butdrillingforgas can require
multimillion-dollar investments
to bore thousands of feet into the
ground. Such wells produce a lot
of gas quickly, Cavnar said, but
production falls off before long,
requiring companies to drill
more and more sites to remain
profitable.
If successful, the microbe
technology could help prolong
the future of Wyoming's gas
industry, which supports tens of
thousands of jobs and provided
$1.1 billion in tax revenue to the
state in 2009.
Luca officials cast aside
environmental concerns, say-
ing its process for tapping into
natural gas is more eco-friend-
ly and efficient than drilling
because the wells, roads and
pipelines already are in place.
Acquiring methane from exist-
ing coal beds requires very

little new infrastructure, Luca
says, and puts to use byproduct
groundwater by pumping the
water back down into the coal-
bed methane wells.
About 30,000 coal-bed meth-
ane wells have been drilled
in the Powder River Basin in
northeastern Wyoming over
the past 15 years. About half are
nearly or completely tapped out.
"We think the source here is
huge for us to be able to go in and
reactivate those wells and start
producing gas again," Cavnar
said.
Thousands of different
microbes - no one knows
exactly how many species are
down there - live in the thick
coal seams several hundred feet
beneath the rolling prairie in
northeast Wyoming.
Luca has been doing DNA
research to identify the fewer
than 100 species which play dif-
ferent roles in breaking down
the complex organic molecules
in coal into a single simple mol-
ecule, said Roland DeBruyn,
the company's vice president of
engineering.
"The microbes, they're
really working in communi-
ties," DeBruyn said. "They're
kind of taking different pieces
of the chain apart. And in the
end, you're left with the small-
est pieces of the chain, which is
basically methane."
The other company looking
to tap into the new source of
energy, Ciris Energy, got a $4.8
million matching state grant in
2009 to build an above-ground
pilot facility that would employ
microbes to turn coal into meth-
ane.
Wyoming has a substantial
interest in such investments:
About 40 percent of the U.S. coal
supply comes from Wyoming,
providing more than $2 billion
in economic benefit to the state
each year.

New scoreboards
to be installed in
Crisler, Yost arenas
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Visitors to the Big House this
fall will view football games on
LED screens that are 40 per-
cent larger and have new custom
scoring systems, the University
Athletic
Department First seen on
announced -the wire
yesterday.
Two 4,000-square-foot video
screens will be installed in each
end zone of Michigan Stadium.
Though demolition of the cur-
rent screens began last month,
the new scoreboards will be
installed by this August - in
time for Michigan's first game of
the 2011 season against Western
Michigan on Sept. 3.
The project is slated to cost
about $20 million, according to
a communication to the Univer-
sity Board of Regents submit-
ted by Athletic Director David
Brandon in January. The regents
unanimously approved the plan
at their meeting in January.
The Athletic Department
has employed Texas-based TS
Sports/Lighthouse to replace the
scoreboards in the three facili-
ties, Brandon wrote in a press
release issued yesterday.
"We are excited to partner

with TS Sports on new, state-of-
the-artscoreboards forour three
largest venues," Brandon wrote.
"Our goal is to set a new, higher
standard for our fans' viewing
experience and the game day
atmosphere we create in our
venues. These boards will be an
important first step in achieving
that goal."
Video screens will also be
installed at Yost Ice Arena for
the first time, replacing the are-
na's current scoreboards. The
arena will receive nine, center-
hung LED video displays, the
release stated.
A new center-hungscoreboard
made of 14 LED video displays
will also replace the current
13-year-old scoreboard in Crisler
Arena. The new scoreboard will
be part of a $52 million facelift
of the facility, which calls for
a 63,000- square-foot addition
and an overhaul of the building
that is intended to improve the
fan experience, Brandon wrote
in a Jan. 20 press release.
"Our goal is to create a home
court advantage for our teams
while making the fan experience
memorable from the moment
they walk into the arena," Bran-
don wrote.
Crisler Arena's video equip-
ment will also be converted to
high-definition during the con-
struction, and the Michigan
Sports Television Production
Studio will be relocated to Mich-
igan Stadium until the project is
completed in 2013 or 2014.

Ghadafi aides

BRUSSELS
NATO airstrikes finanCIa offers

have strong impact
The international aerial
onslaught against Moammar
Gadhafi's forces has destroyed 30
percent of Libya's military capac-
ity, a senior NATO official said
yesterday.
NATO warplanes have flown
851 sorties in the six days since
the alliance took command of
all operations from a U.S.-led
international force that had been
bombing Libya since March 19.
Dutch Brig. Gen. Mark Van
Uhm said Canadian Lt. Gen.
Charles Bouchard, who com-
mands the Libyan operation
from his headquarters in Naples,
briefed NATO's governing body
yesterday.
"(Bouchard's) assessment is
that we have taken out 30 percent
of the military capacity of the
pro-Gadhafi forces," Van Uhm
said.

Critics worry
incentives will set
bad precedent for
future
LONDON (AP) - It's an offer
that diplomats hope Moam-
mar Gadhafi's family and top
aides can't refuse: If they pub-
licly withdraw support for the
Libyan dictator's regime, the
restrictions on their assets and
travel plans could be made to
vanish.
The U.S. Treasury and Brit-
ain's Foreign Office have spelled
out the details of the proposal,
and discussions are now under
way at the European Union
ahead of a meeting of foreign
ministers next week. Talks
on the proposed deal will also
take place among U.N. Security
Council members if any of those

named under U.N. sanctions
flee from Libya and renounce
Gadhafi.
Gadhafi's seven sons, a wife,
his daughter, two cousins and
other allies who have served
him for much of his rule are all
being given a chance to escape
international blacklists and
reclaim billions of dollars of
seized funds.
But some critics recoil atthe
thought, wondering whether
the incentives will set a bad
precedent for giving billions
back to possible plunderers or
even if the measures will work
to oust Gadhafi.
The offer came as Gadhafi's
forces unleashed a withering
bombardment on the rebels
outside a key oil town yes-
terdayy and a U.S. envoy met
with the rebels in the eastern
city of Benghazi in a possible
step toward diplomatic recog- A
nition.

(More) open housing
New gender-neutral policy is too exclusive
or the University's LGTBQ students, gender-neutral hous-
ing - also known as open housing - has been a goal they
have strived to achieve at the University. Gender-neutral
housing gives students the option to live with a roommate regard-
less what gender the individual identifies with. While the majority
of students have positive experiences with their roommates, recent
tragedies among young people add cause for concern. In Septem-
ber, for example, a Rutgers freshman committed suicide after his
roommate videotaped him having a sexual encounter with another
male and posted it online. While this obviously doesn't represent
the norm, isolated incidents like these make a case for the benefits
of gender-neutral options for students.

The University, with the guidance of the
Spectrum Center and the National Center for
Transgender Equality, recently broadened
its definition of transgender to include gen-
der non-conforming and gender-questioning
students. The school deserves recognition
for the decision. For many students, college
is a time of identity exploration, and forcing
them to ascribe to strict gender identifica-
tion to obtain gender-neutral housing could
be counterproductive. Still, these definitions
are too exclusive.
A gender-neutral housing policy will take
effect atthe Universitythis fall. But the Univer-
sity Housing website specifies that only trans-
gender and gender non-conforming students
will qualify for the policy. The new policy will
allow gender non-conforming and transgender
students to live with other students who have
the-same gender identification.
While this policy is a positive start toward
creating a more comfortable environment in
University Housing, it does not go far enough
in helping all students. All students should
have the choice to obtain gender-neutral
housing, not just those who ascribe to partic-
ular gender identifications. University Hous-

ing should be a safe and comfortable place
for all students, and steps should be taken to
ensure that gender-neutral housing contrib-
utes to that goal.
Gender-neutral housing has long been
a pet project of former Michigan Student
Assembly President Chris Armstrong. His
support of the Open Housing Initiative aided
the progress toward full open housing oppor-
tunities for all students, not just the select
few the University deems it appropriate for.
While the University has a history of sup-
porting the LGTBQ community, this policy
prioritizes the needs of transgender and gen-
der non-conforming students over other stu-
dents. It is unacceptable to consider that one
minority is more important than another. It
is not only transgender students who face
harassment or uncomfortable situations that
open housing could potentially combat. Crit-
ics of full open housing argue that students
would abuse the policy in order to live with
their significant others in residence halls.
But the poor decisions of a few should not be
a hindrance to the majority of students who
would greatly benefit from a comprehensive
gender-neutral housing policy.

ot all of us have had the
opportunity to truly expe-
rience different cultures
before coming to
Ann Arbor. Sure,
we have worked
hard to prepare
ourselves for col-
lege, but when it
comes to diversi-
ty, many people's
first time living
with someone of JEFF
a different faith WOJCIK
or political ideol-
ogy happens at
the University. It is this embrace of
diversity of thoughts and excellence,
that makes it so great to be a part of
such an amazing team of scholars,
athletes and artists. Diversity is the
most important part of our educa-
tion, and the most important compo-
nent of our pride in the Block 'M.'
It's not the world-class profes-
sors or amazing classmates who
make the University great, but
rather their coexistence and col-
laboration that define the Michigan
difference. To illustrate, look first
at our curriculum.
As students, all of us enjoy an
extraordinary academic playground
at the University. The LSA cur-
riculum requirements are the per-
fect example of the important role
diversity plays in academic excel-
lence. Many people bemoan the need
to complete distribution require-
ments and the need to experience all
aspects of LSA. Yet, the breadth of
our education is the real strength of
our degrees. There are other liberal
arts colleges in America, that have
courses taught by similarly creden-
tialed faculty to our own. However,
there is no other College of Litera-
ture, Science and the Arts. There is
no other space at any institution,
that motivates students to grapple
with natural science, social science,
humanities and other topics in an
attempt to balance undergraduates'
education quite the way the Univer-
sity does. So get excited about taking
that changing atmosphere class, and
don't be scared by a poetry course.

The variety is good for us.
Yet the University is more than
a diverse selection of seminars and
lectures. It's not just the variety
infused in our education, but the
uniqueness of our experiences out-
side the classroom that makes the
University so special. Many of us
bringdifferentbackgrounds and dif-
ferent approaches to decision mak-
ing to the table. This often causes
conflict, and it can cause us to push
each other in opposite directions.
However, this conflict mimics the
larger conversation of Michigan and
the United States. Debating issues
related to campus affairs, perform-
ing research to prove generalizable
theories and working through polit-
ical disagreements prepares us for
the real world, and will help us with
problems we cannot even imagine at
this stage in our lives.
These disagreements most fre-
quently manifest themselves in the
student organizations. Whether
working to increase the graduation
rates of minorities, hosting events
like the Latin@ Cultural Show or
organizing volunteers for Greek Ser-
vice Day, the reason for the strength
of a group is the multitude of opin-
ions about how to get the job done.
More than the diversity of beliefs,
opinions and views that matter to our
1,200 plus student organizations on
campus, it's the summation of all our
individual organizations working
together that advances the mission
of the University, and demonstrates
the importance of a Michigan edu-
cation. This means that individually
we do not always need to place first
in all we do to remain "the victors."
Take the Athletic Department for
example. Though national champi-
onships are great signs of athletic
excellence across the nation, it's the
entire department that demonstrates
our influence in collegiate athlet-
ics. It's not just football, but softball,
track and field and volleyball which
powerfully represent the Block 'M.'
Combine those with conference
championships for the men's swim-
ming and diving team and men's ice
hockey team, in addition to the first

Big Ten Championship for the men's
soccer team, and it's clear we have
an outstanding Athletic Department
- especially outside revenue-gen-
erating sports, even when Michigan
doesn'twin the national title.
In addition to the success of South
Campus, this University has become
a safe space for LGBT students. We
have an award-winning daily news-
paper, a men's glee club that will
share its talent with Cuba this sum-
mer and the Sexual Assault Preven-
tion and Awareness Center that
defends the rights of all students. All
these aspects contribute to our edu-
cation at Michigan. All are necessary
for the creation of the next genera-
tion Michigan men and women.
Academic variety
is a strength of
the University.
The diversity in our curriculum
supports the dynamic nature of our
understanding and our experiences
away from our courses. Individually,
our programs are good: We're top 20
or top 10 in almost everything. But
what makes us the Leaders and the
Best is the combination of all the aca-
demic-departments, sports teams,
arts groups, student governments,
faculty, students and staff provid-
ing an uncommon education for us
common men and women. So go to
a women's basketball game, learn
from and appreciate ROTC students,
fight back against famine and pov-
erty in Africa, attend events puton by
your hall's multicultural council and
interact with the Muslim Students'
Association or a community other
than your own. Get involved and
take pride in being a part of the team,
the team, the team.

Support Detroit Partnership Day

Yesterday the Michigan Student Assembly
reviewed a proposed resolution calling for the
University to divest funds from, among other
companies, Northrup Grumman - a compa-
ny that supplies the radar equipment used in
Israeli military aircrafts. While we recognize
the concerns of those who seek to encourage
more responsible investments by the Univer-
sity, this is not a resolution we can support.
We believe resolutions that cast Israel as
solely responsible for the Middle East conflict
only lead to greater polarization on campus.
This resolution will inhibit - rather than fos-
ter - the ability to build the broad coalition
necessary for peace.
While we oppose this resolution, we ear-
nestly stand with the writers of the reso-
lution in their desire for justice for the
Palestinian people and we condemn the
targeting of innocent civilians - Palestin-
ian or Israeli - as immoral. However, in the
long history of this conflict, both sides have'
committed grave violence toward the other
and both sides have experienced tremen-
dous loss. This resolution incorrectly assigns
blame only to Israeli military actions with-
out acknowledging the context in which they
occur. The devastation in Gaza that elicited
condemnation from international human
rights groups was a response to months of
terrorist rocket attacks on Israeli cities.
Targeting Northrup Grumman for supply-
ing Israel with weapons and technology that
have contributed to Palestinian civilian casu-
alties dismisses the necessity of these same
supplies inthe work of ensuring Israel's legiti-
mate defense. Creating an environment where
peace can be achieved will require partner-
ships based on recognition of the legitimate
claims of both sides and real loss suffered by
both peoples.
At other campuses that have reviewed
resolutions such as these, the result was only

greater polarization. At the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley, for example, the student gov-
ernment sessions ran for hours as protesters
and counter-protesters chanted insensitive
and ignorant slogans. Tears were shed, rela-
tionships were lost and, in the end, the out-
come did not bring peace any closer.
While we do not support this resolution
and fear its effect - as this debate unfolds -
we reject rhetorical arguments that polarize
campuses further. We do not believe that sup-
port for divestment from Israel is inherently
anti-Semitic, and we know that opposition to
divestment is not equivalent to support for
the occupation. We aim to model an engaged
dialogue, free from simplistic rhetorical slo-
gans and derivative attacks on opponents,
in the hope that all sides will recognize our
collective responsibility to civil discourse on
campus.
. We believe rather than pursuingthese divi-
sive resolutions, we can find ways of work-
ing together on campus to achieve peace. We
can support Palestinian businesses through
microfinance and encourage Palestinian-
Israeli economic cooperation through invest-
ment in the Trade Unions United for Israel
and Palestine. In addition, we can and must
exert political pressure on all parties to nego-
tiate for peace.
The peace that we all want to see can come
about only by consensus, and consensus is
built through cooperation. Even amid the
most difficult arguments, we hope to contin-
ue to seek platforms for cooperation with all
groups on campus working toward peace and
justice in the region in the coming weeks.
This viewpoint was written on behalf of
the J Street UMich Board by LSA sophomore
Yonah Lieberman, chair of J Street UMich,
and LSAajunior Dafna Eisbruch, Coffee Talk
Committee Chair of J Street UMich.

Despite a fearful forecast of freezing rain on this past
Saturday's Detroit Partnership Day, the sun shined on
Detroit as 1,100 University volunteers worked alongside
hundreds of community members at 29 sites. Partici-
pants fought blight by demolishing abandoned homes,
beautifying neighborhoods with urban gardens, creat-
ing friendlier spaces for children by cleaning up parks
and schools and changing the landscape of neighbor-
hoods by painting murals. The goal: To perform service,
and form bonds with Detroiters.
DP volunteers did more than just make a difference
in the city. They formed a connection to the city, to its
people, its organizations and its neighborhoods. DP
Day is about more than community service; it's about
service learning. Volunteers met residents, learned
about community nonprofits and engaged in mean-
ingful conversations with neighbors and volunteers
from across the city. This is part of the true value of DP
Day. DP Day is not about "saving" the city, and the DP
doesn't view Detroit as merely a backdrop for service.
The purpose of DP Day is to open volunteers' hearts
and minds to the city of Detroit, to engage with com-
munity members, to reflect about what it means to do
service, to explore ways to become more involved in
the larger community and to show why we should be
interested in the city.
This Thursday, DP Day volunteers are invited to dis-
cuss their experience at a pizza chat at 7 p.m. to 8:30
p.m. in3463 Mason Hall. Volunteers can come to reflect
on their service work and tell the DP how they would
like to see the volunteer experience improved for next
year. Even those who did not participate may come to
learn more about ways to stay involved in Detroit. For
students who missed DP Day, the DP will provide infor-
mation on an upcoming service opportunity in Bright-
moor, a neighborhood on Detroit's northwest side where

more than 700 DP Day volunteers worked. In addition to
offering weekly volunteer programs in schools, church-
es and community centers, The Detroit Partnership is
working with The Ginsberg Center to create Sociology
389 - athree-credit Project Community course that will
further foster the learning aspect of the DP weekly vol-
unteer service-learning experience. Attendees can also
hear about a weeklong DP Day experience: A Detroit
Partnership alternative spring break trip.
Students interested in getting more involved in
The Detroit Partnership, who have passion for raising
awareness about social justice issues, breaking stereo-
types about people and the city of Detroit and actively
creating a movement for social change by engaging in
service learning, should apply to the planningteam and
become DP leaders.
The DP Planning Team is an enthusiastic group of 50
people with a common goal: Spread love for the city of
Detroit through service learning. In addition to plan-
ning major events such as the One Stop Shop food and
clothing drive and DP Day, team members organize edu-
cational events, publicity, finance and weekly volunteer
programs throughout the school year. Applicants don't
have to be "Detroit experts" to be on the team, they just
have to be willing to open their eyes, minds and hearts
to Detroit. In the process, The DP hopes members will
learn just as much about themselves as they will learn
about Detroit - and that they'll have fun with DP plan-
ning teammates along the way.
So volunteer for a weekly program next fall, visit an
education event or apply to the planning team at www.
thedp.org. Planning Team Applications are now avail-
able on the website. Please submitthem by Sunday, April
10 at 5 p.m.
Cassie Basler is the Detroit Partnership external director.

Nintendo pops out 3DS

Paul D. Miller takes
the stage as Penny

By LUCY PERKINS
DailyArts Writer
While some DJs will only
mix house or hip-hop beats
and ignore older music, Paul D.
Miller - also
known as DJ Paul D.
Spooky - uses
old records as Miller aka.
well, seeing DJ Spooky
them not as a
dead space but Tomorrow at
a living space. 5:10 p.m.
Tomorrow,
Miller will be MichiganTheater
at the Michi- Free
gan Theater as
a part of the Penny W. Stamps
Distinguished Visitors Series
presenting an event called
"Sound Unbound."
"I try to dig into every sound,"
Miller said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily. "I've taken
images and sounds of different
places and times and rearranged
it. I guess the academic term
is interdisciplinary ... I move
between genres and frames of
reference - I think of art as the
ultimate renewable resource."
Growing up in Washington,
D.C., Miller had aspirations of
being a diplomat, and music was
just something he did on the side
- a diversion that allowed him
to forget about his schoolwork.
"I got to taste how music

could justbe fun," Miller said. "I
didn't have to think about diplo-
macy, foreign policy or macro-
economics."
While a student at Bowdoin
College in Maine, Miller saw
DJ gigs as something to fill his
summers between semesters.
But soon, this newfound hobby
grew into a more serious pas-
time. Miller started his own
radio show, mixing tracks in
what later could be seen as the
beginnings of his career as a
turntablist.
"Music was just a weird
hobby that spiraled out of con-
trol," he said.
After graduating with
degrees in philosophy and
French literature, Miller
moved to New York, getting
DJ gigs that paid enough
to cover rent. For Miller,
music had evolved from
a hobby to a career, a
shift that parallels the
way he defines music.
"Any sound can
be transformed
into music," he
said. "You can
take a digital
media file and
mix it with a You-
Tube clip. There's no
permanence right now,
there are just revolutions."
According to Miller, music's
constant metamorphosis can be
seen in the life of any individual.
"The entire world is changing
right now," he said. "People no
longer feel like they're going to
have permanent jobs or health

care. These things are important
parts of people's lives. These are
things that, as artists, we are
going to have to face because the
place we call home right now is
culturally turbulent."
Today, Miller is a writer, art-
ist and DJ using his music to
make audiences feel the way he
feels about what's going on in
the world.
"That's what makes it a mas-
terpiece," he said. "Music can be
a reflection of any inter-
nal or emotional
landscape, and
' it usually is."

Even if half of that "who's who"
of rock groups abandon their
projects altogether, there's still
enough left over to make 2011 a
standout year for the genre.
There's a fundamental prob-
lem with declaring rock's death
even if we ignore the status of its
revival. Rock can't be dead - it
still reigns supreme in one cru-
cial category: touring. The gold,
silver,.and bronze medal in con-
cert revenue in 2010 all belong
to rock outfits: Bon Jovi, U2 and
AC/DC, respectively. That's not a
fluke - three of the top four tour-
ing acts of the decade are rock
groups (the Rolling Stones, U2
and Bruce Springsteen). In fact,
of the top 25 touring acts, one
band managed to sell out every
single show they played. With 288
performances, that - of course
- would be Bono's U2. Consider
the festivals, too: The biggest
are undeniably Coachella, Lol-
lapalooza and Bonnaroo. Aside
from the occasional pop appear-
ance - like Wiz Khalifa or Lady .
Gaga - the events are absolutely
dominated by rock and alterna-
tive shows, from the headliners
to the smaller complementary
names.
So don't despair, rock fans.
The genre's not returning, largely
because it never went anywhere
in the first place. We're poised
on the precipice of a phenomenal
year, so relax - rumors of rock's
death are greatly exaggerated.

College slam comes home to A2

Competition gets hike to Houston for a chance to
watch these epic battles unfold.
poetic at CUPSI Instead, the nation's largest col-
legiate team poetry slam will
this week return home this week to its
birthplace - Ann Arbor.
By LAUREN CASERTA The College Unions Poetry
Daily Arts Writer Slam Invitational (CUPSI) is an
annual competition that brings
it's that time of the year again. together teams of poets for four
Time for teams and their coach- nights of creative expression and
es to gather friendly competition. Founded
from colleg- Colg Unions in 2001 with seven teams, slam

country for Poetry Slam looned to include roughly 40 col-
relentless Invitational lege groups.
head-to- "This year we'll have the larg-
head rounds Tomorrow est number of teams to date,"
as rowdy through April 9 said program leader and CUPSI
audiences At UMMA the Union founder Robb Thibault. "There's
cheer on al Mgoingto be a wonderful variety of
their peers and he League returning colleges from around
and heckle Free the nation, as well as some local
scorekeep- Michigan schools that I've never
ers. But you won't need to hitch- seen participate before, so it's

going to be very exciting."
Thibault started playing with
the idea of a collegiate slam com-
petition in 2000 as he experi-
mented with weekly poetry
readings while working at the
Michigan Union.
"I kept thinking that it would
be a cool thing to do on a cam-
pus, since it's a can't-miss kind of
thing," Thibault said. "We start-
ed a fall poetry reading program
to see if it would appeal to Mich-
igan students and we ended up
getting 700 people every other
Wednesday on a regular basis."
The slam itself features
rounds known as "bouts," in
which teams of four or five poets
compete using a unique scor-
ing system. Each poet has three
minutes to perform an original
piece, and each poem is given
five scores - the middle three
are added together to give an

overall score. Groups of up to
four people may read at the
same time, but any use of music,
costumes or props is prohib-
ited. The teams with the high-
est collection of scores progress
through four days of competi-
tion to a championship round.
The slam's scoring method is
unconventional and often con-
troversial - five random mem-
bers of the audience are selected
before the start of the competi-
tion to act as judges, doling out
scores ranging from zero to 10.
These scores are often contested,
and audience members are not
shy about their feelings regard-
ing the judges' choices.
"These judges are charged
with the sacred honor of hav-
ing to give numbers to words,"
Thibault said. "Sometimes
they're highly praised for their
valuable scoring, but sometimes,

when the crowd doesn't like
what they see, they're scorned.
The judges play a great role in
the slam and they cause a great
deal of concern, and no one
seems to like them in the end."
Thibault is quick to remind
his participants that, despite the
competitive nature of the slam,
the presentation of the event as
a gathering of poets and poetry
aficionados is the true goal of the
venue.
"The poetry itself is really
what matters," Thibault said.
"We like to think of the axiom,
'Points are not the point, the
point is poetry.' No matter what,
you're up there doing what you
love and what's most impor-
tant to you artistically and as a
human. That's what it's really
all about: freedom of expression,
creative speech, diversity and
having fun."

came in the form of a document
released Monday titled the "Dear
Colleague Letter" and details the

ties must follow under Title IX,
which "prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in any feder-
ally funded education program or
activity," the letter states.
"(The Department of Educa-

requirements of Title IX cover
sexual violence and to remind
schools of their responsibilities

tive steps to respond to sexual

The program is sustained on
private donations, supplemented
by aid from other churches and
businesses in the area, Gray said.
Over the years, the church has

had hundreds of volunteers from
across the community and a vari-
ety of religious denominations.
Gray said she didn't realize
the program would have such
longevity when it initially began,
but each year the number of peo-
ple coming to the breakfast has
increased. In addition to the com-
munity's homeless population, she
said other disadvantaged individ-
uals in the area occasionally seek
meals, including those struggling
to make ends meet while working
minimumwage jobs.

"(It's a) simple thing I can do

Mobley said because of the
recession, she's seen an increase
in the number of people using the
service since she started volun-

Before Michigan voters

crepancy about how to handle
sexual violence at the University.
"Nearly all of the pieces that
they are asking for colleges and

She said programs like peer

since SAPAC was established 25
years ago. SAPAC, which is oper-

sion of Student Affairs, raises
awareness about sexual assault
and abuse and "provide(s) people
with the tools to be able to pre-
vent those crimes in the first
place," Rider-Milkovich said.
"Our education and prevention
measures are ahead of the curve
across the board," she said.
According to the U.S. Justice

according to an April 1 Yale Daily

states that Yale violated Title IX.
Despite the recent grievance,

Former head football coach Lloyd Carr speaks at a School of Public Health symposium yesterday.

CARR
From Page1A
Carr said participation in
sports is important for students
and children, but necessary pre-
cautions must always be taken to
ensure safety.
"(It's) always important to
remember the risks involved and
preparing for the safety, health
and well-being of ourselves
before engaging in such sports,"
Carr said during the discussion.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
Carr said people should take
advantage of the University's
resources to educate themselves
about concussion prevention.
"I think it is important to
recognize that there are a lot of
things going on at this University
from an educational standpoint,"
Carr said. "It is important that we
take advantage of this potential
and put it to good use in stopping
this injury problem."
While Carr highlighted the
University's resources, another
panelist, David Sleet, associate
director for science in the divi-
sion of unintentional injury pre-

vention at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, focused
on steps the CDC has taken to
spread information to athletes
and coaches about how to prop-
erly deal with concussions.
Sleet also spoke about trau-
matic brain injuries in children,
citing that children ages 10 to 14
are most likely to suffer from con-
cussions or other traumatic ,rain
injuries. He added that traumatic
brain injuries are responsible for
50,000 deaths and 235,000 hos-
pitalizations each year.
The CDC offers more than
200,000 training sessions annu-
ally to youth sports coaches and
staff on how to properly diag-
nose, treat and prevent traumatic
brain injuries, he said.
"It is very important to recog-
nize that sports are not the only
way a concussion is suffered,"
Sleet said. "It is also important to
note that a concussion can occur
- despite common belief - with-
out loss of consciousness, and in
fact, more commonly does occur
without loss of consciousness."
A player who suffers a concus-
sion might forget plays, appear
dazed or confused, have long-
lasting dizziness or speak in inco-

herent sentences, Sleet said. He
stressed the importance of iden-
tifyingandreportingthese symp-
toms to ensure players' safety.
The third panelist, Jeffrey
Kutcher, the director of the
Michigan NeuroSport Concus-
sion Program at the University,
said one of the biggest miscon-
ceptions about head traumas,
specifically concussions, is that
they primarily occur in football.
However, he noted that over the
past severalyears,one ofthe most
common sports in which Univer-
sity athletes suffered head trau-
mas was water polo.
Head injuries are not a new
phenomenon and have been an
issue for decades, Kutcher said.
He added that the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association was
founded in 1906 at the direction
of former President Theodore
Roosevelt to help prevent injuries
in college sports.
"Head injuries are not a new
concept," Kutcher said. "This
was first described in 1928 in
boxers, so these problems have
been occurring for decades. This
is nothing new, as has the process
of prevention, arguable at too
slow of a rate."

The program doesn't current-
ly have a set budget, but Zollweg
said making improvements on
North Campus is an important
goal for the University.
"If Michigan is going to strive
to be the leaders and best, this is
something that needs to bea high

Some future activities on

LSA junior Shannon Chase heard
about the St. Andrews breakfast
program and now volunteers
every Wednesday morning. She
said she enjoys helping at St.
Andrew's in particular because it
has built a sense of community in
Ann Arbor.
"I liked that it had been going
on for so many years, and it was
involved in the community,"
Chase said. "It wasn't sensational
or a fad, just people serving peo-
ple in need year after year."
Chase added that volunteer-
ing at St. Andrew's allows her to
get to know homeless individuals
in Ann Arbor in a more personal
way.
"I like learning people's names
and faces because when you see
people asking on the street for
money it's easy to just dismiss
them," Chase said.
In addition to servingthe daily
meal, the church offers a weekly
writing workshop. Beginning at
8:30 a.m. every Tuesday, Court-
ney Mandryk, an English lectur-
er at the University, and George
Cooper, a University lecturer in
English and the Sweetland Writ-
ing Center, come to the church to
guide a small group in writingon
a variety of topics.
Mandryk and Cooper began
working at the church about a
year and a half ago, but the writ-
ing program at St. Andrew's has
been in existence for five years.
The workshop begins with the

Commission and the Residence
Hall Association, according to
Zollweg.
A survey regarding North
Campus has already been admin-
istered to students, Zollweg said.
The survey showed that many
students were concerned with
the accessibility of University
Health Services for sick students
on North Campus. Zollweg added
that students also requested bet-
ter lighting throughout North
Campus and more social events.
Speaking in anticipation of
tonight's event, Zollweg said she
wants to hear more about what
students want in terms of services
and programs on North Campus.
"(It is) an opportunity for stu-
dents to voice their reactions,
their needs ... what they want,"

the potential to be fabulous."

Kim renews friendship Love III, Olazabal to tee off with

with former champion

'M' golfer, Veteran Choi helps Kim

ByKEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga. - After play-
ing a practice round with Michi-
gan golfer Lion Kim on Monday,
Zach Johnson, the 2007 Masters
and a seven-
time PGA Tour KEVIN
champion, RAFTERY
wasn't afraid
to take a jab
at the Masters At the Masters
rookie.
"(Playing with Kim) was great,
outside ofhimbeing a Wolverine,"
Johnson joked on Tuesday after
his practice round. "He smells -
much like any other Wolverine."
Johnson, an Iowa City native
and die-hard Hawkeye fan, has
been friends with Kim for years.
Both players have worked with
golf instructor Brian Mogg since
the early 2000s.
"I've known him for so long,
and we have that type of rela-
tionship," Kim said, "We can joke
around and have fun."
Added Johnson: "We had a
great time. He's matured a lot,
and his golf game is really good."
But on the 16th hole Tuesday,
Kim was the one with the last
laugh.
When it was Johnson's turn to
hit the traditional skip shot over
the pond and onto the green, he
barely got the ball over the bank,
and it settled about five yards
short of the green - cueing a few
boos and snickerings from the
crowd.
Kim, playing two groups
behind Johnson on Tuesday,
didn't disappoint the crowd (his
trick shot on both Monday and
Tuesday settled about 15 feet
from the hole).

"This time I was real confi-
dent," Kim said. "I knew what to
expect."
Kim pulled out a five iron and
skipped the ball over the pond
and onto the middle of the green,
where it looked like it would stop
about 30 feet from the hole.
But the ball caught the steep
slope on the 16th green and slowly
trickled down to the pin, located
on the front left portion of the
green. The roar from the crowd
grew louder each second as the
ball crept closer and closer to the
hole, and spectators let out a col-
lective "Oh!" as the ball missed
the hole by mere inches.
"From my angle, it looked like
it was going in," Kim said.
The ball scooted just past the
hole and settled about four feet
from the pin - easily one of the
best trick shots of the day. A few
people in the crowd even gave
Kim a standing ovation.
But regardless of Kim's clear
ability to skip a ball over a pond,
the veteran Johnson had some
relevant advice for the budding
star, too.
"I just kind of told him about
a couple of pins here and there,
where to hit it, just that sort of
stuff," Johnson said. "Just the
basic stuff that I've kind of gath-
ered over the years. Hopefully it
helps him."
Johnson mentioned that Kim
was nervous, as nearly all new-
comers are during their first Mas-
ters experience.
And when asked what his first
Masters experience was like, the
36-year-old paused.
"I don't remember my first
time, sorry," he said with a smile.
"I remember I was nervous, that's
about it."

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga. - It was a dis-
turbing thought for KJ Choi.
When the 40-year old met
with Michigan senior Lion
Kim to play a
practice round NOTEBOOK
with him on
Tuesday, he was reminded of a
story from 2002, when Kim was
a spectator at the Bay Hill Invi-
tational.
"It's very scary," Choi said
after the round.
While at the Invitational,
the then-13-year-old Kim took
a picture with Choi and hung it
on the wall in his room.
Nine years later, Kim was
walking down the pure fairways
of Augusta, chatting with and
learning from Choi throughout
the round Tuesday morning.
"There (are) so many kids
in the commons who are like,
'KJ, you met me (years ago),' "
Choi said. "But it's a good sign
of good teachers. It's very excit-
ing."
Regardless of the age differ-
ence, Choi has been a valuable
source for Kim as he contin-
ues to master the fairways and
greens at Augusta.
The pair played a practice
round together on Sunday too.
"He's been great," Kim said.
"I went over to him in the morn-
ing and said hello, and he said,
'Join me for today's practice
round,' so I said, 'I'd love to.' "
On the course today, with
winds hollowing and the fair-
ways wet after a fierce storm
blew through the area last
night, Choi made sure Kim real-

ized this wasn't how the course
would be on Thursday. The
temperature this morning was
in the low 50s, but by the week-
end, it is forecasted to be in the
upper 80s.
"He told me a lot of things,"
Kim said. "He told me not to get
used to these wind conditions
(today). It's pretty wet out there
too. So he told me to just focus
on hitting my chip shots and
hitting a lot of putts."
Choi, who is making his
ninth career appearance at the
Masters (he tied for fourth last
year), spent time with Kim on
the range, too.
And while there, Choi
noticed something that might
help Kim's game.
"I looked at his grip," Choi
said. "In the grip there was
something wrong. Grip is very
important, so I asked him, 'Do
you, sometimes when you hit it,
(realize) there is a wrong grip?'
And he said 'Yes.' "
And Choi is convinced the
grip change could make a big
difference come Thursday.
"There will be a big change,"
Choi said. "I guarantee (it)."
PAIRINGS POSTED: The
pairings for the first and second
rounds on Thursday and Friday
have been posted.
Kim will tee-off with Davis
Love III and Jose Maria Olaza-
bal at 12:31 p.m. Thursday and
at 9:02 a.m. Friday.
Olazabal is a two-time Mas-
ters winner (1994 and 1999),
and is one of just 16 players to
win the tournament more than
once.
Ironically, Olazabal defeated
Love III by two strokes in 1999

sit
1e

Senior golfer Lion Kim practiced at Augusta National Golf Club on Tuesday
with K.J. Choi, who finished in fourth place at the 2010 Masters,

to take the title.
Love III's second place finish
was his best-career finish at the
Masters.
Love III has also won a major
championship before, as he
took home the PGA Champion-
ship crown in 1997.
Combined, the two have won
26 PGA tour titles and 24 inter-
national event titles.
PAR THREE CONTEST
WEDNESDAY: Kim will be
playing with Bubba Watson and
Aaron Baddeley in Wednesday's
annual par three contest.
Kim was the first golfer to
sign his name for the one 1:00
pm. timeslot, and hours later

he was told by the 32-year-
old Watson they'd be playing
together.
"I saw Bubba on the range
and he said, 'Oh, are you Lion
Kim? I'm playing with you
(Wednesday),' " Kim said. "So
I think that's pretty amazing.
We're going to have a blast.
"He's obviously a great young
stud out here, and I'm going to
learn alot from him as well."
NOTES: In an article post-
ed on Monday by Golf Digest,
Kim was ranked sixth in the
"Top Ten Rookies to Watch in
Augusta" list.
There are 20 total first-time
players in this year's field.


Caporusso relishing underdog
role with Frozen Four looming

SPRING FOOTBALL
Borges balances Robinson's
unique ability within offense

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sparta Editotr
Matt Frattin is lights out.
With 36 goals to his credit and
just recently being named a mem-
ber of the Hobey Baker Award
'Hat Trick finalist' club, the North
Dakota senior forward is part of
the most prolific offensive squad
that the Michigan hockey team has
faced this season.
"To have someone that potent
scoring that much is dangerous,"
said Wolverine

Louie Caporus-
so after practice on Monday.
But Caporusso is perfectly con-
tent playing the underdog role for
once this season. In fact, it's a role
he's relished ever since he was a
young kid back in Woodbridge,
Ont.
"You never want to be the favor-
ite," Caporusso said after practice
on Monday. "That'sthe wayIseeit.
Even on a personal level, I always
lovebeingthe underdog."
It's no secret.
The Fighting Sioux have six
players with at least 13 goals along
with two 20-plus-goal scorers.
From top to bottom, North
Dakota has a lengthy list of accom-
plishments thatcan make an oppo-
nent weak in the knees. From its
30-win netminder in Aaron Dell to
its 4.14 goals per game, the deck is
stacked against Michigan.
"When you're the underdog, you
just got to work hard and simplify
your game," Caporusso said. "But
at the same time, we're playing one
really good team. North Dakota is
the best team in the tournament,
hands down. We've got our hands
full."
But while the Fighting Sioux
boast a hefty offensive resume,
Caporusso knows the NCAA Tour-
nament is a one-and-done scenar-
io, with the loser not getting an
opportunity to play in Saturday's
national title game.
He and the Wolverines are just
hoping to catch North Dakota on
its off day.
"One day, one game, and any-
thing can happen," Caporusso
said.

Senior forward Louie Caporusso has notched11 goals and 19 assists this season.

a Falcons jersey - he wore the
block 'M,' and his name was Bill
Muckalt.
During the 1997-98 campaign,
the Michigan hockey team played
at Bowling Green on Nov. 21, win-
ning 4-2. In the post-game press
conference, according to Michigan
coach Red Berenson, Powers was
asked what was the difference in
the game that night.
"Michigan's got a player that's
an NHL player. That was the dif-
ference. He was that much better
than anyone," Powers said.
A former seventh round draft
pick of the Vancouver Canucks in
the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, Muck-
alt played on the Michigan hockey
team from 1994-98.
Prior to his senior season,
Muckalt had the option of forego-
ing his final year in Ann Arbor and
jumping ship to the professional
ranks.
But Berenson had other plans.
"He could have left, but I was
after him to stay," Berenson said.
" 'You make sure you stay. This
is your time.' And it was his time.
He elevated his play, and he was a
dominant player."
Brendan Morrison, Jason
Botterill, Blake Sloan and Mike
Legg - all integral pieces to the
1996 NCAA title team along with
Muckalt - had graduated the year
before.
And according to Berenson,
1998 was the year Muckalt finally
came out of Morrison's shadows.
Without the comfort of being on
one of the most dominant lines
during the Berenson era, Muckalt

hoisted the team on his back from
day one that fall.
After senior captain Matt Herr
suffered a groin injury in the sea-
son-opening game against Min-
nesota, sidelining him for a few
months, Muckalt was a different
player.
"Billy Muckalt carried the
team," Berenson said. "It was
unbelievable. He really came into
his own."
Thirteen years removed from
leading the Wolverines to their
ninth program championship,
and the Surrey, British Columbia
native just finished his first year
coaching the New Mexico Mus-
tangs, an inaugural team in the
North American Hockey League.
But while the Mustangs finished
dead last in the South Division
with a 19-35-4 record, Muckalt felt
the team could compete with any-
one in the league near the end of
the season.
"If we play our system and play
for the name on the front of the
jersey rather than the name on the
back, we can have success," Muck-
alt said.
Muckalt added that having the
ability to coach a group of rookies
and aid in their development as a
hockey player along with a person
is truly a rewarding experience -
and that some day, impacting the
lives of players within the confines
of Yost Ice Arena would be a wel-
coming experience.
"Some day, if the opportunity
came around, I'd love to come back
and be part of that staff and be a
part of Michigan," Muckalt said.

Al Borges stopped mid-sen-,
tence, as he described how he
wanted Denard Robinson to
pose the threat of running on
every play.
"While some quarterbacks
may run five or six yards, he'll
run 55 yards," Borges said.
Borges explained that in his
offense, Robinson is expected
to push forward, after he drops
back, lending the footwork to
create a natural tendency to lead
up field and scramble - if there's
an opportunity.
But he also doesn't want Rob-
inson to turn down open receiv-
ers, either.
Then he became parched.
"I'm talking too much, you've
got me in a football deal now,"
Borges said as he was handed a
bottle of water.
"But don't turn down wide
open receivers," he continued.
"But if they all fall off, run like
hell."
This offseason, Borges was
handed the keys to a Porsche
and had the task of changing the
engine, without losing speed.
It has been a fine line to walk
in maximizing Robinson's unique
skill set and also maximizing
what he thinks the Michigan
offense is capable of. There's no
doubt in Borges' mind that Rob-
inson will remain the focal point
- the ball's just going to be spread
around more, and they're going to
be aggressive, particularly in the
runninggame.
A year ago, the Wolverines'
ground game was Denard Rob-
inson. And Borges isn't ignor-
ing that fact as he switches the
offense to a pro-style scheme.
There will be designed quarter-
back runs. And Michigan will
work out of the shotgun - more
than at any time in Borges's
career.
"Denard does some things that
are dynamic that I can't coach -
that nobody can coach," Borges
said.

with it the slow onset of bliss replac-
es whatever the hell I was thinking
about before. As I've done thousands
of times before, I had forgotten the
time. Four o'clock in the afternoon:
the hour of the Harmonica Man.
I take another step.

BYT1 YLEHELLNERK

The standard blues progres-
sion is I-IV-V, which is to say
from the root to the subdom-
inant then the dominant and back to
the root. The root chord is a place
of harmony where all notes resolve
back to their original mode. It's the
"Doe" in the "doe, a deer, a female
deer..." song some of us were taught
,in elementary school. The sound
of the root is one of tranquility and
serenity. There's nothing hinting at
darkness in the distance or horror
on the horizon.
That is the subdominant's job
as it arrives with all the disorder
and lack of control that the name
implies. This is where I find myself
on a cold April morning, startled

realized he inherited the natural-

to complete a motion picture,
Morrison slowed down the game
to where it felt that he was the
only one in control, eventually
pressing the fast forward button
to make an impossible play look
routine.
"His hockey IQ was off the
charts," Muckalt said.
Yet, just having superb vision
on the ice wasn't going to amount
to much without something more,
the X-factor that some only dream
of sincerely possessing.
While some kids faked it, Mor-
rison lived it.
But according to former Lake

slump and the stress of endless pro-
crastination of essay writing have
me trapped in the IV. It's the "Fa"
and "a long, long wayto run" is right.
And so the school day goes on
as planned. My homework, under
the guise of bedtime reading, is dis-
cussed in classes with more on the

assigned, new lectures need to be
reviewed and all the while those

closer to completion. I begin to enter

Superior State coach and current
Notre Dame hockey coach Jeff
Jackson, without the will to com-
pete, Morrison would have just
been a good Division-I player.
Instead, Jackson called Mor-
rison great - "as good q college
player" he has seen during his 25
years behind the bench.
"There's a lot of kids out there
who are pretty skilled, but he had
the competitiveness and competi-
tive drive to dominate a game,"
Jackson added.
And no one could testify more
to that statement than Wiseman,
who could look across the Michi-
gan hockey locker room and know
that Morrison was there "for all
the right reasons."
The fear had been instilled in
Morrison long before his arrival
at Michigan.
Fear?
Yes, fear.
The fear of letting down his
teammates, coachingstaff or Uni-

There was Botterill, the big
power forward who could finish
from in close and whose physi-
cal presence and leadership were
integral pieces to the most domi-
nant line during the Berenson
era.
And finally, Morrison, the cen-
terpiece of the line, the player
who seemed to have eyes in the
back of his head.
No, actually he did.
Muckalt, who played with
Morrison for the better part of
three years as a Wolverine, knew
that firsthand.
"I've never had the opportu-
nity to play with somebody who
knew where you were at without
even looking," Muckalt said. "We
didn't even have to call for the
puck. He always knew where the
open ice was, and then as a player
playing with him, you just had to

fear of failing.
To do so would be unaccept-
able in the eyes of Morrison. He
cherished the opportunity to con-
tribute to the success of the team,
to help in any way possible.
Killing late penalties, scoring
game-winning goals - you name
it - Brendan Morrison was the
"ultimate team player" in the eyes
of Berenson.

The chase was on to celebrate
the '96 championship.
The only question that
remained was who was going to
catch Morrison first.
As Morrison rounded the net to
greet his teammates, he collided
with teammate Harold Schock,
sending him in a whirlwind to the
ice.
A few seconds later, Morrison
was pounced on by two familiar
faces. following the biggest goal

of his illustrious collegiate career.

Take a closer look at that pic-

No. 16 Bill Muckalt sandwiched
on top of Morrison - and the
season behind it: 88 goals and 99
assists totaled among them. The
following year, they outdid them-
selves, tallying 94 lamplighters
and 119 assists.
"At that time, they might have
been the best line in college hock-

would still put that line during

THEJUNKDRAWER
random student interview bysarahsquire

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
between journalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred. Hello there!
What do you do on campus?
I'm like not really involved in
much because I'm a senior.
So what do you do all day?
I go to class some days. Other
days I probably go to the bar. Um,
I study sometimes. I try to study,
but I've been bad lately about that.
Do you have a job for next year?
Not yet.
Do you know what you want to
do?
I want to do human resources or
public relations.
Do you know where you want
to live?
New York.
Why New York?
Because I'm from there.
Where are you from?
I'm from Connecticut, from like
right outside of New York.
That's not New York.
But I'm right outside. I'm like an
hour by train.
It's a different state.
Not really though.
Do you exercise at all?
I do exercise, butI don't like run
outside. I usually do like tread-
mill, elliptical. I'll do like free

weights. I'm working on getting
some bigger guns, but it's not
going so well.
Have you ever done jazzercise?
No, I do Zumba. I love Zumba, it's
awesome. I recommend it - with
Jane, Fridays 6 to 7.
What is Zumba like?
Zumba, it's a lot of African Latina
beats and alot of shaking your
body, moving your arms, alot of
arm exercises so it's good for me.
Sounds pretty good. What kind
of bars do you like to go to?
I like the usual. I love Ricks. I
like Charley's. I'm not that big of
a Skeeps fan anymore. I feel like
I've outgrown it. I go to Brown
Jug sometimes, Blue Lep.
Do you usually go on regular
nights - like Thursday through
Saturday - or do you tend to go
Mondays and Tuesdays?
I'm going out tonight actually, I
wasn't going to.
Where are you going?
I think I'm going to go to BTB and
Charley's tonight. I want 80 cent
drinks, really badly.
What classes are you taking
now?
I'm taking art history, I'm taking
Latin American studies, I'm tak-
ing the like IGR Dialogue Race
and Ethnicity and I'm taking, oh,
like an African art class.
Which is your favorite of them?
Um, I like the art history class,
but the teacher is, like, really
bitchy.
How so?
She's just, like, angry all the
time. She just randomly yells at
people. She'll be, like, "I know
you're on your laptop looking at
Facebook. Stop it." And someone
might not be doing that, but she
calls everyone out. It's horrible,
it's really bad.
Why do you like the class so
much?
I like the material. I don't like
her. I like the subject matter.
Did you see Obama kicked off
his campaign for re-election?
Oh did he? I'm not really into
him.
Really? Why not?
I don't really like what he's
doing with, like, Middle East,
and I don't like really what he's
doing with education. I'm just
not a fan of him. I'm a really big
Israel supporter, and he in his
campaign was all about Israel
and creating peace, and he's just

not doing that.
Who did you vote for?
I voted for McCain. I don't like
Palin. I don't think she's an intel-
ligent person, but I liked McCain,
some of his issues, more. I'm more
of a moderate. I'm not liberal,
I'm not conservative, I'm, like, in
the middle so I was like...Obama,
McCain, Palin's the worst, butI
don't know. I just like McCain.
Do you like the old man thing?
Um, not really. I mean if that's
what some people are into that's
cool. But noI don't like the bald-
ing thing. I like hair.
OK.
Yeah, hair's good. And he's very,
very white. Like super white.
Kind of pasty.
Yeah a little pasty. He needed to
like, when he was in Arizona with
all his people loving him, he prob-
ably should have gotten a little
tan going.
There is a study that says taller
people with good hair tend to
do better in business.
I believe that. I definitely believe
that.
Do you like Obama's hair?
There's not much there.
Not much, yeah, he's O.K. He's a,
he's a decent looking guy. I'll give
him that.
How about Michelle?
I would not mess with her in
like an alley. I would be more
scared of her kicking my ass than
Obama. Like, those guns are like
crazy.
Maybe she does Zumba also.
I think she does.
I think she'd be really intoit.
I think we would have a lot of fun
doing Zumba together. I feel like I
should like talk to her about that.
How do you feel about Snyder
for commencement speaker?
I'm very upset about it.
Why?
Because, first of all, it's boring.
We should have gotten a celebrity
because we had Obama last year.
Who would you have liked
instead?
I wanted John Stewart. Every-
one in my grade wanted John
Stewart. We were all hoping for
him because Colbert is going to
Northwestern to speak, so we
were like "Oh, we'll definitely get
Stewart," and there was an article
in the Daily about like getting
him, and I was like "Oh, it's going
to happen."

But it was just a column.
I know, butI thought like he
had some sway there. I thought
maybe, like, I thought John Stew-
art would read it and be like "Oh,
I have to come to Michigan."
You think John Stewart reads
The Michigan Daily?
I think he might. I think he
might, definitely...I mean we all
signed a petition, I think almost
everyone in my grade signed a
petition to get rid of him.
To get rid of Snyder?
Yeah there's like, I think maybe
like 100 or 200 didn't sign...You
can't speak at a college if you're
like, ruining education.
But it'll still be interesting to
hear his point.
I think I might boo him.
That's still interesting.
Maybe I'll like throw things at
him. I don't know, I'm gonna do
something.
You'll probably be sitting far
away - you can bring like a
slingshot.
Oh, that's probably a good idea. I
should bring like a NERF gun. I'll
think of something creative to get
at him.
Do you like Jenny from the
block better? Jenny Granholm?
The old governor...you've never
heard her called Jenny from
the block?
No, no, I did not. That's really
funny. Is she from like the Bronx?
No, I don't think so.
That's really funny, I've never
heard that before. I'm like, what
are you - I was like J.Lo is going
to come here?
J-Lo is kind of past her time.
Yeah, she's overrated.
She came out with a song
recently and everyone was like
"Who are you?"
It was the worst. It was the worst!
I listened to it, and I was like "Oh,
J-Lo and Lil' Wayne. This is going
to be good." No. Like do not even
listen to it on iTunes, like it's not
worth it.
Do you have a shout out to your
readers? Say hi to Mom and
Dad?
Hi Mom and Dad in Connecticut.
I guess I'll be seeing you, gradua-
tion. I'll probably be unemployed
so you're going to have to support
me. That'll be fun for them. Not.

marked governmental bag that has immunity from search
and seizure.
"There were many ways," said Ellendea Proffer in a phone
interview from California about getting literature back into
Russia. "If we had friends going and they were not going to
be searched, or there was a good chance they were not going
to be searched for one reason or another, we'dsend stuff with
them, butwe were in Ann Arbor, hardly the center for travel
to Russia."
The Proffers often sent literature back with Russian trav-
elers and scholars hoping that, because the government
couldn't search everyone, some of their contraband would
get through. Much of their literature was sent to Paris and
was sold there. They also used the CIA-funded International
Literary Center in New York that helped smuggle literature
across borders.
In the Ardis archives that Ellendea donated to the Univer-
sity Libraries, Crayne said there are coded letters that were
indecipherable to the Soviet authorities.
"We have extensive correspondence about sneakingthings
back in, sneaking things out," she said. "There were all kinds
of verbal codes that were used to try and communicate that
something had started moving in the right direction or some-
thing didn't."
Carl Proffer often enlisted the help of his students in the
Slavic department to help translate the literature and work in
the publishing press. According to Crayne, Ardis was closely
tied to the reputation of the Department of Slavic Languages
and Literatures, and Carl was a rising star in the field.
"I was in Wisconsin, and I can tell you that one of the pro-
fessors was screaming at another professor saying, 'Get this
guy over here!' " Crayne said. "They wanted him. They want-
ed him badly."
When Russian poet, essayist and eventual Nobel Prize
winner Joseph Brodsky was deported from the Soviet Union
in 1972 for poetry that was considered "pornographic and
anti-Soviet" and for "social parasitism," Carl Proffer helped
him adjust to life in the United States. Brodsky came to Ann
Arbor and taught at the University. He remained a staple in
the Slavic department, teaching poetry and often visiting
other universities until 1981.
"That was an amazing thing, that he saved this guy who
would later get a Nobel Prize," Suny said. "And Ardis and the
Slavic department, and having Brodsky here - all the things
that they did, the publications, all that stuff put Michigan on
the map as a center of Slavic Studies."
Brodsky was met at Detroit Metro
Airport by the Proffers and a large
amount of press. In order to per-
suade the United States to let him
into the country, they had to cre-

ate publicity around the possibility of his arrival, according
to Ellendea.
"Joseph gave a lecture at Rackham. That was his first act
- was to read his poetry - and Carl whipped up sometransla-
tions," she said. "Eleven hundred people came to hear a poet
that they didn'treally know much about, butthe publicity was
extreme around this."
One of their more risky endeavors was the publish-
"Any literature
that would
encourage freedom
of thought would
be considered
harmful."
- Janet Crayne, head of the
Slavic division at the
Hatcher Graduate Library
ing of "Metropol," a literary anthology of 23 writers. Vas-
ily Aksyonov had organized and submitted the anthology to
Soviet censors. It was denied publishing rights in that coun-
try, and he resorted to asking the Proffers if they would pub-
lish "Metropol." They obliged, but were punished for their
participation and had their visas denied.
"The Proffers
were banned from
Russia and, actu-
ally, the United
States banned
them from

going," Crayne said. "Ellendea referred to them as revolu-
tionizing Russian culture and universal knowledge of it.
The United States saw them as a threat. By that time, Carl
was diagnosed with cancer, and he was never able to go back
again."
According to Crayne, this crushed the Proffers. They had
never wanted their project to get political: For them, the pub-
lishing house was solely about preserving the quality of lit-
erature.
"They didn't start getting involved in politics because they
wanted to," Crayne said. "They loved Russian culture, and
politics just had to get played to get done what they wanted
to get done."
Ellendea said their "aim was not to get in trouble and not to
get our authors in trouble," and noted that "there were other
political publishers."
According to Suny, Stalin's regime was very restrictive
when determining what literature could be published. Under
Khrushchev's rule a "thaw" occurred - more freedoms were
slowly being allowed and more books were being published,,
When Brezhnev took control, he began another crackdown
on Russian artists. In 1965, the government arrested writ-
ers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel and sentenced them to
labor camps for "anti-Soviet agitation."
"There was this struggle going on as to how much freedom,
how much openness, how much criticism they were going to
allow," he said.
According to Crayne, Ardis was a threat to the Soviet
regime because it gave people the power to think critically
and creatively.
"Whenever .you have a society that's basically a dictator-
ship in one way or another, in order to maintain that author-
ity, information has to be limited so that people can't let
themselves think freely," she said. "Any literature that would"'
encourage freedom of thought would be considered to be
harmful."
Today, Ardis is still well known in Russia. When Univer-
sity Libraries had an exhibit focusing onthe publishinghouse,
Russian patrons came to celebrate the publisher's assistance
to the dissident movement. Last spring when The Maly Drama
Theater of St. Petersburg came to the University to perform
Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," many of the performers had heard
of Ann Arbor because of its history with Ardis, according to
Crayne.
"Ardis was really, really famous in Russia and actually still
is," Ellendea said. "That's howthey know Ann Arbor. To them
it only means one thing." -
While Ann Arbor may be known for its Football Saturdays
and staples like Zingerman's Deli, to a large group of people
on the other side of the globe, Ann Arbor is a symbol for free-
dom of creativity.

here are aspects of University history that
we all know. We celebrate how President
John F. Kennedy announced the creation of
the Peace Corps on the steps of the Michi-
gan Union in 1960, and brag that Students
for a Democratic Society held its first meet-
ing on our campus. Still, there are aspects of University his-
tory that are lesser known, but no less important.
S While the rich and exciting activism of the '60s was
winding down, another type of civil disobedience - in the
atypical form of a publishinghouse - was just getting offthe
ground in Ann Arbor. Ardis was a publishing house formed
to print and celebrate the works of Russian writers who were
not able to get their literature past Soviet censors. While
gaining world recognition, Ardis helped to establish the Uni-
versity's Slavic department as a premiere place for studying
Soviet culture.
In 1969, Carl Proffer, a University professor of Russian
literature, and his wife Ellendea, a graduate student at Indi-
ana University studying Slavic Languages and Literatures,
travelled to Russia on a fulbright scholarship during Leonid
Brezhnev's rule. It was there that the couple met Nadezhda
"vIandelstam, the widow of the late Russian poet and essay-
ist Osip Mandelstam, through a letter of introduction. In

T hey called it the "vomit comet" for a reason. According to an article in The
Michigan Daily ("Flying into Zero-Gravity," 11/23/2003), Michigan engi-
neers decided to create the feeling of no gravity by designing a satellite that
plummets 8,000 feet down out of the air. The students were a part of the Univer-
sity's Student Space Systems Fabrication Laboratory. They repeated their free fall
experiment 80 times in two days in Houston as a part of NASA's Reduced Gravity
Research Program.
The 8,000 feet controlled free-fall kept the stint safe. When the craft dropped,
the engineers experienced microgravity because the speed of the aircraft was the
same as the speed inside, causing the daredevils to float in mid-air. The students
simulated the drop, also known as "formation flying," to gauge the calculations
that are factored in as the satellites separate once in orbit. It's as if these under-
graduate engineers were human satellites for two days.

BRENDAN MORRISON'S LASTING
BY MARK BURNS

LEGACY

OF EMBODYING MICHIGAN


e was a betting man. There was no getting around that. When he
arrived at the office, he threw everything on the table.
The stakes were always high because that's how he wanted
them to be. It didn't matter if he was competing in an exhibition
contest or playing in the 1996 NCAA national title game against Colorado
College.
He put the pressure on himself to perform.
Except he wasn't betting with chips like people normally do.
No, he bet using the tools of the trade - he bet on himself.
The soft wrister that couldn't break a pane of glass. The not-so-pretty
stride that couldn't beat some opposing players in a footrace. The physical
presence that couldn't intimidate an eighth grader.
None of it mattered. It didn't matter that he wasn't exceptionally gifted in
any of those facets of the game.
The expectations of Brendan Morrison were high because coach Red
Berenson demanded more.
"(Morrison's) expectations were he was going to be a leading scorer,"
Michigan assistant coach Billy Powers said. "He was going to be a point pro-
ducer. He wanted to be on the ice at the pivotal 5-on-5 shift where we needed
a goal.
"His expectations have always been, 'I'm going to get the goal or make the
play that's going to help us."'
He came to the rink everyday with his pockets turned up-and an empty
wallet for four seasons. He was all in, all the time.
For four years, former Hobey Baker winner Brendan Morrison was a
household name at 1016 South State St.

"When he needed to perform, and when the chips were on the table, his
game was unbelievable," former teammate and linemate Bill Muckalt said.
Ka-ching
Everyday Brendan Morrison was cashing in on one ofthe most successful
careers in Michigan hockey history..
THE BLUEPRINT
Billy Powers had his eyes fixed on the "Brendan Morrison Shrine" in the
Michigan hockey coaches' lounge.
Fifteen seconds had slowly come andgone.
The Hobey Baker award along with a shadowbox housing Morrison's No.
9 Michigan jersey sit along one of the walls. Two pictures of Morrison - one
by himself on the ice and another with him alongside Berenson accepting the
Hobey Baker in 1997 - complete the mural.
Thirty seconds.
It had been a half-minute since I asked Powers the final question of our
10-minute interview: How would you sum up Brendan Morrison in one word,
phrase or sentence?
Silence.
Every 10 seconds, Powers's eyes diverted from the television to the shrine.
Finally, he couldn't remove himself from the tribute to Morrison - evidence
of a coach perplexed by the impact of a player who accomplished more than
any other Wolverine during his collegiate career.
The constant stare toward the shrine was evident of a coach perplexed
by the impact one player had on the program, of a player who accomplished
more than any other
Wolverine during his
collegiate career.
- Of a player who
was impossible to
c describe in a few
measly words almost
15 years after his exit
from Yost Ice Arena.
A full minute.
Still, no response
from Powers, and
as I waited, the
- 0 other answers I had
received from the
exact same question
came to mind.
"Brendan was just a first-class human being," Michigan associate coach
Mel Pearson said. "If you had a mold of a type of kid, not only for Michigan
hockey, but asa Michigan athlete, he'd be it."
"First class," equipment manager Ian Hume iterated.
"He was a class act," said 1994 graduate and former teammate Brian
Wiseman.
More silence.

One hundred andfive seconds.
Powers finally had an
answer to a complex ques-
tion that had already been
easy for some and harder
for others.
His answer wasn't sur-
prising in the least bit -
instead, it was expected.
"Classy," Powers said.
"That's how I'd describe
Brendan."
People associated with
the program realized the
special character Morrison exhibited during his stay at Michigan.
His exceptional play and off-ice demeanor demanded respect.
On March 30, 1996, following the Wolverines' victory over
Colorado College in the NCAA title game, fans at the Riverfront
Coliseum were all witnesses to what Berenson and the Michigan
coaching staff already knew for quite some time.
This kid was special, damn special, and unlike any player that
had come through the program during Berenson's career.
As if on cue, and having the No.1 label attached to him and the
program in Cincinnati, Ohio, Morrison finally declared in front of
everybody, "This is for all the (Michigan) guys who never had a
chance to win it."
He had just scored the game-winning tally - a wide-open goal on Tiger
goaltender Ryan Bach and arguably one of the easiest goals of his career - to
clinch Michigan's eighth national championship.
And all he could think about was the past.
The Wolverines' failures in the NCAA Tournament. The overtime losses.
The upsets.
Former Wolverines like Mike Knuble, David Harlock and Aaron Ward,
who preceded Morrison and didn't have the fortunate opportunity to win a
national title - this was for them.
The program's 32-year championship drought was over, and Morrison
knew who he had scored for.
"He put that moment - that was a special moment for him - but he had
the wherewithal to acknowledge those people that fell a little short who
came before him," Wiseman said. "That says it all about the kind of guy he is."
Even to this day, Morrison is in a class all by himself.
"He epitomizes the Michigan hockey program," Berenson said. "If you
met him, you would have thought he was a fourth-line player."
SEPTEMBER 1993
Morrison had just witnessed a few hockey games, a gymnastics meet and
the infamous Fab Five during his first recruiting trip to Ann Arbor.
He was "blown away by the atmosphere and the whole magnitude of
Michigan."

But that was all before he stepped
into the office of Berenson, the
ambassador who started the pattern
of college players making the transi-
tion to the National Hockey League.
Needless to say, the extracurric-
ular activities were an afterthought
following the meeting with the for-
mer NHL Coach of the Year.
"I guess you could say I went
through the ringer with him a lit-
S_- tle bit," Morrison now jokes. "He
doesn't beat around the bush at all.
HOBEY J He tells you the way things are,
EM AI and I have a tremendous amount
of respect for him because of that
quality."
While some coaches reverted
to wining and dining potential
recruits, Berenson flipped the equa-
tion, asking hopeful Wolverines
what they could do for Michigan.
Once fall rolled around for the
start of the 1993-1994 campaign, in
walked a boyish 18-year-old Morri-
son, and Berenson soon found out what the Pitt Meadows, British Columbia
native was going to do for the program - and him.
For associate coach Mel Pearson, he had seen similar versions of Morri-
son, who looked more like he should be entering high school rather than the
University of Michigan.
"He had that look to him, he just looked so young," Pearson said of Mor-
rison. "He looked like he was 12-years old, and he shouldn't be in college."
Regardless of how he mightnotchave been able to grow a modern prototyp-
ical-Matt Rust beard in a week, it
was Morrison's on-ice presence
that really caught the attention
of the Michigan coaching staff, as
well as teammates such as Wise-
man.
"We were in awe in regards
to his talent level coming in as a
freshman," Wiseman said of his
first impressions of Morrison. - '
"You knew he had somethingspe-
cial that we were going to see at
some point in time in his career."
Wiseman and other seniors
like goaltender Steve Shieldswere
overwhelmed by the freshman's
abilities. Morrison's uncanny

knack for locating teammates on the ice was a quality uncharacteristic of
players so young in their Division-I career.
But everything Morrison accomplished was expected of him, even if he
was only a freshman.
Morrison had a dynamic '92 campaign with the*British Columbia Hockey
League's Penticton Panthers, with whom he tallied 35 goals and 59 assists.
"He came in with a lot of accolades, and it wasn't too long before every-
body knew that he was as good as advertised," Hume said.
Michigan was just fortunate enough he made the decision to eventually
open an account in Ann Arbor.
THE ASSETS
Brendan Morrison would wait, wait and wait some more. He'd hold onto
the puck for as long he could until finally pulling the trigger and making a
crisp cross-ice pass heading out of the zone.
But it wouldn't be without raising coach Red Berenson's blood pressure a
few notches, the 27-year coach jokes years later.
"We'd be on the bench. 'Move it, move it,' " Berenson remembered. "And
he would be holding it, and then he'd make a great play. Then you'd say, 'Well,
what a great play.' In the meantime, he'd have you on the edge of your seat."
Assistant coaches Mel Pearson and Billy Powers both dubbed Morrison
arguably the smartest player they've seen come through the program.
"When a game started, he had a magical way about him where he could
make things happen on the ice," Pearson said.
But the magic started long before Morrison even touched the ice.
It started in the locker room before the game, with the mental preparation
and the visualization of what plays he was going to execute.
It began at a young age when Morrison started playing organized hock-
