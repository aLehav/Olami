Security secretary 

talks prejudice 
in response to 

terrorism

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

DEARBORN 
— 
Department 

of Homeland Security Secretary 
Jeh 
Johnson 
stopped 
at 
the 

University’s 
Dearborn 
campus 

Wednesday as part of a nationwide 
tour emphasizing the importance 
of combating prejudices against 
the Muslim community and taking 
action in response to terrorism.

The tour was part of the “If You 

See Something Say Something” 
campaign, which aims to raise 
public 
awareness 
of 
possible 

indicators of terrorism and, increase 
understanding of when and how 
to report suspicious activity to the 
proper authorities. 

Speaking 
to 
combatting 

terrorism, Johnson highlighted the 
importance of developing a strong 
and positive relationship between 
various communities, specifically in 
order to avoid isolating the Muslim 
community.

“Part of my message is, now more 

than ever given the nature of what 
we see, it is critical that we build 
bridges to Muslim communities 
around this country,” he said. 
“The answer cannot be to vilify 
the Muslim Americans in this 
country.”

Over 40 percent of Dearborn’s 

population is Muslim, and hundreds 
of U-M Dearborn students gathered 
to hear Johnson speak Wednesday. 
Student leaders also met with 
Johnson prior to the event.

He 
noted 
that 
combatting 

terrorism remained a core focus of 
DHS — the department was initially 
formed after the 2001 terrorist 
attacks on New York to increase 
coordination and national security.

Johnson 
also 
discussed 

undocumented immigrants, saying 
the Obama administration believed 
a solution to the large influx of 
immigrants from Central America 
can be found by approaching 
immigration as a refugee issue.

“Immigration is probably the 

most emotional subject I have dealt 
with as a public servant,” he said. 
“We in our administration regard 
the problem of families fleeing 
Central America essentially as 
a refugees problem. We want to

In 2015, the lack of queso as 

a menu option wasn’t the only 
reason people were not eating 
at Chipotle.

From October to December, 

53 people in nine states were 
affected by an E. coli outbreak 
in 
Chipotle’s 
food. 
While 

the source of the outbreak 
still hasn’t been determined, 
Chipotle has since increased 
food 
preparation 
safety 

measures in the hopes of 
preventing further outbreaks.

No 
Chipotle 
outlets 
in 

Michigan have reported E. coli 
outbreaks.

“The 
silver 
lining 
of 

not knowing is that it has 

prompted us to look at every 
ingredient we use with an 
eye to improving food safety 
and handling practices for all 
ingredients on an ingredient-
by-ingredient 
basis,” 
said 

Chris 
Arnold, 
Chipotle’s 

executive 
communications 

director.

Engineering 
senior 
Jake 

Fratkin, 
president 
of 
the 

Food 
Industry 
Student 

Association, said he’s noticed 
a decline in people going to 
the restaurants. He said he 
thinks the outbreak was an 
unfortunate 
combination 

of bad luck and failures in 
testing, noting the variability 
of the food industry in terms 
of how certain crops are raised 
each year.

“I have a lot of respect for 

what Chipotle does and how 
they operate,” he said. “So it is 
kind of sad for me to suddenly 
see people not going there, but 
it is their fault because you

Scholar discusses 
history of exhibits, 

importance of 
storytelling

By MARGOT SHERIDAN

For the Daily

Wednesday night, a crowd 

gathered at the University 
of 
Michigan 
Musuem 
of 

Art to hear curator Barbara 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 
discuss the creation of the 
POLIN 
Museum 
of 
the 

History of Polish Jews.

Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is a 

scholar of performance and 
Jewish studies as well as a 
published author and curator 
of the POLIN Museum. Born 
in Canada during World War 
II to Jewish immigrants from 
Poland, she has dedicated her 
life to the history of museums 

and to the heritage of the 
Jewish community in Poland.

A few members of the 

audience 
had 
visited 
the 

museum in the past; however, 
many said they were there to 
learn more about it.

The idea for the museum 

emerged in 1993, and was 
founded by the Association 
of 
the 
Jewish 
Historical 

Institute 
of 
Poland,

Researchers develop 
understanding of X 

chromosome

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

For 
many 
years, 
scientists 

thought 
they 
understood 
the 

inactivity of X chromosomes in 
females. However, new University 
research 
challenges 
previous 

assumptions and could lead to new 
avenues for treating diseases tied to 
the chromosome.

Females 
have 
two 
X 

chromosomes, while men have 
one X chromosome and one Y 
chromosome. As a result, one of 
the X chromosomes in women 
is randomly inactivated in order 
to 
balance 
gene 
expression. 

Chromosomes contain DNA, the 
instructions for how the body 
functions.

In a paper recently published 

in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, University 

Alicia Garza comments 
on the future of the civil 
rights movement in speech 

at Hill

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporter

The bitter cold and snow did not deter 

nearly 600 students from gathering in the 
Lydia Mendelssohn Theater Wednesday 

evening to hear from Alicia Garza, a 
prominent social activist and a co-founder 
of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The event served to kick off the 

University’s 30th annual Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Symposium that 
takes place in the days leading up to and on 
the holiday commemorating the revered 
civil rights activist.

Garza said she wanted to structure 

her speech as a conversation, which the 
audience responded to by punctuating her 
words with appreciative snaps and words 
of agreement.

“Being Black is a crime,” Garza said. “I’ll 

say that again. In this country today, it’s 
safe to say that being Black in the United 
States is a crime — meaning shoot first, ask 
questions later.”

The Black Lives Matter movement began 

with a 2013 social media post expressing 
Garza’s anger over George Zimmerman’s 
acquittal. Zimmerman, who was on trial 
for the shooting death of Black teenager 
Trayvon Martin, was acquitted after 
pleading not guilty by self-defense.

She ended her post with the phrase

UNDECK THE HALL

Professors discuss motivations 
behind Russia’s foreign policy 

Panelists see 
aggression in 

Crimea as strategic, 
Putin as cautious 

By CALEB CHADWELL

For the Daily

In a panel discussion at the 

Ford School of Public Policy 
Wednesday, 
three 
professors 

discussed Russia’s increasingly 
aggressive foreign policy.

The talk was led by History 

Prof. Ronald Suny, Greta Uehling, 
professor of international and 
comparative studies, and Law 
Prof. Steven Ratner.

The 
event, 
presented 
by 

the 
Michigan 
Journal 
of 

International Affairs Club and 
sponsored by the Department 
of Romance Languages and 
Literatures, was held in response 
to the ongoing crisis in Crimea.

In 
March 
2014, 
Russia 

annexed the Crimean peninsula 
soon after the 2014 Ukrainian 
revolution 
ousted 
then-

Ukrainian 
president 
Viktor 

Yanukovychk. The peninsula is 
internationally recognized as 
part of Ukraine’s territory.

Discussing the history of the 

Crimean conflict, Suny touched 
on remaining implications in 
the region from the Cold War, 
noting that Russian President 
Vladimir Putin stresses that he is 
not imperialist, but simply wants 
stability and continuity.

Suny said while the United 

States media often demonizes 
Putin and Russia, he thinks 
Russia is a weak country that 
genuinely wants stability and 
recognition as a world power.

“Vladimir Putin is not a 

radical, in fact he is relatively 
cautious,” said Suny. “Russia’s 
foreign policy can only be 
understood when one considers 
the entire national arena.”

Suny also spoke about how the 

invasion of Crimea is seen as a 
significant nationalist victory in 
a Russia, where the economy and 
country are severely struggling. 
In the eyes of the Russian people, 
Suny 
said, 
the 
annexation 

is a victory and it would be 
detrimental to Putin’s reign to 
pull out at this point.

Ratner said while Russia’s 

foreign policy may not be 
perceived as imperialist, it’s 
important to note that Russia 
has violated international law 

in some of its undertakings — 
namely, in its annexation of 
Crimea.

“Russia annexed the territory 

of a neighboring state, but the 
way they did it is regarded as 
an abuse of international law,” 
Ratner said.

Offering 
a 
humanitarian 

perspective 
on 
the 
crisis, 

Uehling said serious human 
rights violations that were being 
committed in Crimea under the 
Russian annexation.

“Ukraine 
has 
proved 

remarkably resilient in the face 
of Russian aggression,” Uehling 
said. “However the politics of 
fear promoted by the Russians in 
Crimea are seriously eroding the 
possibility of a civil or tolerant 
society in that region.”

As well, Uehling said social 

stability in Ukraine is important 
for Europe to avoid creating 
another refugee crisis from 
Ukrainians wanting to flee their 
country.

“It’s safe to say that a 

democratic world is a more 
peaceful world, and conflict and 
disorder in any part are going to 
eventually spread to another,” 
Uehling said.

Michigan legislators talk policy 
after State of the Union address

Future goals for 

Dem. representatives 
mirror those outlined 

by POTUS

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

For 
several 
Michigan 

lawmakers, the vision President 
Barack 
Obama 
articulated 

during his final State of the 
Union address Tuesday night for 
federal policy closely mirrored 
what 
they 
would 
like 
to 

accomplish on a statewide level.

Of 
all 
the 
major 
topics 

discussed, state Rep. Jeff Irwin 
(D–Ann Arbor) said uniting 
Americans across partisan lines 
is among the most important 
issues that face both the country 
and the state.

“It’s 
important 
that 
we 

respect each other across these 
partisan lines and ideological 

differences and work together 
to do what’s best for the nation,” 
he said. “I thought that was 
an important message for this 
particular Congress to hear, 
and I think it’s an important 
message for the whole nation 
to hear because there is a real 
partisan division, almost a sort 
of partisan tribalism.”

Like 
Irwin, 
state 
Sen. 

Rebekah 
Warren 
(D–Ann 

Arbor) expressed concern over 
the growing partisan divide.

“I came away with a really 

positive 
feeling,” 
she 
said. 

“Biggest negative takeaway was 
that it was disappointing to see 
that things have broken down 
so much in Washington that 
the president basically did not 
put forward a huge legislative 
agenda because he feels like he 
would not have the success he 
would like. It’s a disheartening 
thing 
to 
acknowledge 
that 

Washington has gotten that 
partisan and uncompromising.”

Warren noted that there are 

bills in the state Senate that 
address 
almost 
every 
issue 

Obama brought up at the State 
of the Union. However, she 
added that those bills will not 
be passed without bipartisan 
cooperation.

“There 
are 
lots 
of 
bills 

introduced on both sides of 
every issue, but just like the 
nation, in Michigan we have 
to work hard to find bipartisan 
ways to work together on these 
issues,” she said. “None of them 
are issues can be solved by one 
party.”

In terms of legislation in 

the state House, Irwin said he 
appreciated Obama’s mention 
of the right for the individuals 
to produce renewable energy on 
their own property.

Irwin is currently working 

to remove barriers on home 
renewable energy production 
through the bipartisan Energy 
Freedom 
bill, 
which 
he 

introduced in September, and 
several other legislative pushes 
throughout the year have also 
focused on clean energy.

“The part of the speech that 

made me smile the biggest 
is when the president said 
Americans deserve the right 
to generate clean, homegrown 
power in their home,” he said. 
“That’s 
exactly 
what 
I’ve 

been fighting for in Michigan 
legislature. 
Every 
Michigan 

citizen should have the right to 
use their property to generate 
clean, homegrown power.”

Warren also lauded Obama’s 

role in recovering the auto 
industry early in his presidency, 
which he highlighted during a 
portion of his speech discussing 
economic successes.

In 2008, the government 

lent funds to General Motors 
and Chrysler to save them from 
bankruptcy. $70.42 billion of 
the $79.68 billion lent to auto 
companies 
was 
ultimately 

repaid, according to the U.S. 
Treasury.

Many Michigan cities, such 

as Detroit, were hit particularly 
hard during the turmoil in

the auto industry. Warren said 
Obama’s leadership was key 
in creating policy to support 
the auto industry and helping 
Michigan’s 
economy 
recover 

from the 2008 recession.

“If you grew up in Michigan, 

you probably have someone in 
your family who has a job in the 
auto industry or related to the 
auto industry,” she said. “If the 
auto industry had truly gone into 
bankruptcy and had not been 
able to recover, it would have 
been devastating for Michigan’s 
economy for a very long time. I’m 
proud looking back at how that 
support was there when it was 
needed. I cannot imagine where 
we would be now had we not had 
that support.”

bring a refugee solution to the 
problem of illegal immigration 
from Central America.”

Additionally, he touched on 

initiatives geared toward large 
universities, 
including 
grant 

building opportunities and a 
student competition, which began 
last semester.

The 
competition 
allows 

students to create a campaign 
to 
curb 
Islamic 
terrorist 

messages to young people and 
encourages students to consider 
working 
in 
public 
service. 

He is currently working with 
universities to allow students to 
get credit for participation in the 
competition.

“I want to encourage the 

students here in particular to 
consider a career serving your 
country,” he said. “It’s a wonderful 
profession, and we need smart 
young people in public service. 
We need a diverse array of smart, 
young people to bring to public 
service diverse experiences and 
backgrounds.”

U.S. 
Reps. 
John 
Conyers 

(D–Detroit) and Debbie Dingell 

(D–Dearborn) helped organize 
and attended both the talk and a 
roundtable discussion between 
student leaders and Johnson prior 
to his speech.

Following the speech, Conyers 

and Dingell both expressed their 
gratitude toward Johnson for 
his visit. Conyers said he had 
never heard these specific issues 
addressed so well before.

“This 
has 
been 
a 
great 

experience,” he said. “We have 
been friends for a very long time, 
but I’ve never heard the issues 
examined so thoughtfully and 
interestingly in terms of how to 
get liberty and security working 
together and complementing each 
other.”

Dingell said she appreciated 

that Johnson elected to visit 
Dearborn immediately following 
the State of the Union address as 
it solidifies the message of unity 
President Barack Obama delivered 
in his address.

“This is my home and I am 

proud to live here, and I’ve been 
very concerned over the past few 
months that we are letting fear 
cause hatred and division,” she 
said. “President Obama had a 
strong message last night. Let us 
hear that message.”

the 

way chicken and steak are 
marinated 
and 
blanching 

certain produce items (such 
as avocados and limes) before 
they are used,” Arnold said.

While 
Fratkin 
said 
he 

believes the average student 
may be intimidated to eat 

there, he added that he’s 
looked into the new safety 
procedures 
and 
thinks 

Chipotle is now one of the 
safer places to eat.

“From a scientific point of 

view and health code testing, 
there is a lot worse that you 
can do than Chipotle,” he said. 
“Really like any large scale 
restaurant, the testing is a lot 
more rigorous than some of 
the smaller businesses.”

LSA freshmen Katie Biggs 

said, under some conditions, 
she still feels comfortable 
eating at the restaurant.

“If they had had (the virus) 

contained for a few weeks, 
then I would definitely go 
there,” Biggs said.

Arnold said he believes 

profit recovery will come with 
the enhanced safety plan, 
allowing the chain to establish 
itself as a leader in food safety. 

Fratkin 
said 
he 
thinks 

that full recovery for the 
restaurant will take time. He 
compared this incident to a 
1993 E. coli breakout at Jack 
in the Box which hospitalized 
144 people who had consumed 
hamburgers from the chain, 

ultimately killing three of 
them.

“It took them like five years 

to return to that same level,” 
he said. “Just like any crazy 
thing you see in the media, it 
seems like it just takes time to 
change people’s perspectives.”

He also said he thinks the 

company’s 
leadership 
will 

dig them out of the slump of 
customers’ uncertainty and 
low sales.

“I think there are smart 

people running the company,” 
he said. “So they will recover. 
But, it just shows how variable 
the food industry is and little 
mistake or chance of luck can 
possibly take down a huge 
business.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Gabby 

Rubinstein said she hasn’t 
visited 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

Chipotle since hearing about 
the outbreak.

“The whole thing made 

me too paranoid to go there,” 
she said. “Plus I was eating 
an 
unhealthy 
amount, 
so 

I 
needed 
to 
broaden 
my 

horizons anyway.”

researchers from the Department 
of Human Genetics suggest that a 
molecule called Xist RNA, which 
was previously understood to be 
responsible for making one of the X 
chromosomes inactive, is actually 
insufficient in doing so on its own.

Instead, 
according 
to 
the 

research, 
there 
have 
to 
be 

other molecules exist on the X 
chromosome that interact with 
Xist to inactivate the chromosome.

Human Genetics Prof. Sundeep 

Kalantry, 
who 
headed 
the 

project, said to conduct the study 
researchers engineered male cells 
to express Xist RNA, which they 
normally don’t do.

“Xist is normally only expressed 

in female cells from the inactive 
X chromosome,” Kalantry said. 
“When we took away an RNA 
transcribed 
in 
the 
opposite 

direction too, we got male cells 
to express Xist. We saw that 
these male cells expressing Xist 
do not undergo X chromosome 
inactivation, so this allowed us to 

conclude that Xist is insufficient to 
cause inactivation.”

Once researchers found that 

Xist RNA does not by itself cause 
X chromosome inactivation, they 
were able to move toward a better 
understanding of what else is 
needed for the process to occur. 
The answer ultimately pointed 
toward other molecules in the cell.

“We found that female cells have 

other factors on the X chromosome 
itself that male cells don’t, and these 
factors are the master regulators of 
X inactivation,” Kalantry said.

Implications of finding those 

factors are far ranging, he added.

“If you were to increase or 

decrease the levels of these 
regulators, then you can turn on 
or off particular genes on the X 
chromosome that normally would 
not be turned on or off,” Kalantry 
said. “As a result, you can modulate 
X-linked gene expression.”

Controlling 
X-linked 
gene 

expression — the appearance 
of 
certain 
characteristics 
or 

illnesses 
tied 
specifically 
to 

the X chromosome — permits 
researchers to be better able to 
understand how X chromosome 

inactivation occurs.

Postdoctoral fellow Srimonta 

Gayen said this understanding 
could 
then 
have 
therapeutic 

applications, by allowing scientists 
to activate the healthy parts of 
the silenced X chromosome to 
compensate for disease-causing 
aspects 
within 
the 
originally 

activated chromosome. This type 
of activation has previously not 
been possible.

Diseases 
linked 
to 
the 
X 

chromosome 
include 
autism, 

hemophilia 
and 
muscular 

dystrophy.

“If we increase understanding 

of the mechanism of how X-linked 
chromosome inactivation actually 
occurs, we can better understand 
X-linked chromosomal diseases,” 
Gayen said.

The study’s authors said future 

research aims to further investigate 
the regulating factors this study 
suggested were responsible for X 
chromosome inactivation.

“We want to find these other 

factors,” Kalantry said. “We already 
have one of them worked out, and 
this is close to being published.”

organization in the country, 
the City of Warsaw and the 
Polish Ministry of Culture and 
National Heritage.

Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 

said one of the difficulties of 
establishing this museum was 
that the creators began the 
process without any sort of 
collection of artifacts.

However, since its opening, 

the 
museum 
has 
proved 

remarkably 
successful, 

according 
to 
Kirshenblatt-

Gimblett. Over 1 million people 
of all ages and backgrounds 
have come to experience the 
multimedia 
exhibition 
that 

documents more than 1,000 
years of Jewish presence on 
Polish soil.

When 
talking 
about 
the 

beginnings of the museum, 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 
said 

the 
founders 
wanted 
to 

share important events in an 
applicable manner.

“What we had was the story 

and we had the commitment 
to tell the story in a vivid, 
compelling way,” she said. “The 
exhibition presents remarkable 
history in a fascinating way.”

She said there is no master 

narrative, but rather many 
historical principles that the 
exhibit tries to convey. Along 
with her speech, Kirshenblatt-
Gimblett 
also 
displayed 
a 

slideshow with images of the 
interior and exterior of the 
POLIN.

The Hebrew word “Polin” 

in 
English 
means 
either 

“Poland” or “rest here” and it 
is a reference to a legend that 
describes the arrival of the first 
Jews in Poland. The museum 
itself stands on land that 
was once part of the Warsaw 
Ghetto.

Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 
also 

spoke to the symbolic nature of 
the appearance of the museum.

“The building is covered 

completely in glass because the 
message of glass is a gesture of 
hope and openness in the face 
of tragedy,” she said.

She said the museum aims 

to situate the Holocaust within 
1,000 years of Polish Jewish 
history, noting that the creators 
did not want the Holocaust to 
be the sole focus of the displays.

“We were able to present the 

Holocaust in its moment from 
the perspective of those people 
who did not know what was 
coming next,” she said. “We 
held strictly to the idea of being 
in the moment and not looking 
forward.”

LSA senior Colleen Murphy, 

who attended the event, said 
she found the talk interesting, 
especially the discussion of the 
physical building.

“I’ve always loved museums 

and as I’ve learned more about 
them through this class, my 
interest in history continues 
to grow,” she said. “What I 
thought was most interesting 
was when she talked about 
museum architecture and the 
importance of the design of 
the building. I think everyone 
can learn a lot from visiting 
this museum, regardless of 
religion.”

In 
closing, 
Kirshenblatt-

Gimblett said POLIN hopes to 
continue the storytelling the 
museum has strived to uphold.

“It is a living organism. It is 

completed by the interaction of 
visitors with the exhibit,” she 
said. “We are working hard to 
keep our story going. Our task 
now is to keep up the success.”

Matter, We Matter, Black 
Lives Matter.” The message 
stuck and Garza ,with two 
others — Opal Tometi and 
Patrisse Cullors — began 
promoting 
the 
hashtag 

#BlackLivesMatter 
on 

social media. The hashtag 
ultimately 
prompted 
a 

nationwide 
discussion 
on 

race relations, specifically 
after recent police shootings 
of unarmed Black men and 
boys such as Michael Brown 
and Tamir Rice.

Garza 
also 
discussed 

the 
future 
of 
the 
civil 

rights movement and the 
importance of the people 
perpetuating activism in the 
real world.

“Hashtags 
don’t 
start 

movements,” 
she 
said. 

“Hashtags 
are 
ways 
to 

continue a conversation. But 
movements are comprised of 
people who share a vision, 
who share a set of values, 
who take action together, in 
order to bring about some 
kind of change, and without 
the work that it takes to make 
that happen, we would just be 
talking on Facebook.”

James Hilton, University 

librarian and dean of libraries, 
also spoke to the theme 
of this year’s symposium, 
#WhoWillBeNext, 
during 

the event. He said the theme 
is meant to ask both who will 
be the next victim and who 
will be the next leader of the 
movement.

“Who will be next to suffer 

racial 
discrimination 
and 

oppression?,” Hilton asked.

Who 
will 
be 
next 
to 

suffer due to their gender, 
gender identity or sexual 
orientation? Who will be 
next to suffer oppression 
because of their birthplace 
or religion? On the flip side 
but equally important, who 
will be next to take up the 
banner of leadership, to fight 
discrimination, 
oppression 

and injustice?”.

LSA junior Jay Akolkar, 

who attended the event, said 
she wanted to learn more 

about the Black Lives Matter 
movement firsthand.

“You see a lot about it 

on social media, but you 
don’t really get to see a lot 
about the people behind it, 
and I thought it was very 
interesting,” Akolkar said.

Garza also spoke about 

her 
experience 
attending 

Tuesday’s State of the Union 
address, where she was a 
guest of her congresswoman, 
Rep. Barbara Lee (D–Calif.). 
She came to the University 
directly from Washington, 
D.C.

Garza 
said 
she 
felt 

compelled to attend in case 
she got the opportunity to 
speak with President Barack 
Obama. Though she did not 
get the opportunity, she said 
her message to the president 
would have been to discuss 
Black lives in the United 
States, as well as to spread 
peace internationally.

“We can still be proud that 

we have a Black president, 
but I’d be even prouder if that 
Black president could admit 
that Black people in this 
country are having a really 
hard time surviving,” Garza 
said.

In particular, Garza said 

she would have appreciated 
clearer 
language 
in 
the 

president’s address about the 
issue.

“We have violent, racist 

rhetoric that is taking hold 
in this country and it impacts 
all of us,” Garza explained. 
“First, it’s directed towards 
Muslims. Then, it’s directed 
towards 
Black 
people. 

Then, it’s directed towards 
immigrants. And then who’s 
next?”

LSA 
sophomore 
Kayla 

Countryman, who attended 
the event, said she came after 
seeing and following the 
Black Lives Matter Twitter 
and finding it relevant to her 
personal and academic life at 
the University.

“She 
is 
so 
personable, 

and what she was saying 
felt so relevant and easy to 
understand, but it was also 
deep in a sense where I really 
felt it, and it made me want 
to go out and do something,

While the consensus among 

the three professors was that a 
return of Crimea to Ukraine was 
unlikely, Uehling proposed twos 
steps that could be taken by the 
United States and other countries 
to alleviate the situation. These 
countries, she said, could help 
groups there trying to monitor 
human rights abuses in Crimea 
and continue to impose economic 
sanctions on Russia.

LSA freshman Amelia Feuka, 

who attended the event, said 
she came because Suny is one 
of her professors and she was 
interested 
in 
the 
historical 

aspect of the conflict in Ukraine. 
She added that she didn’t expect 
to be presented with issues 
pertaining to human rights in 
Crimea or international law, but 

noted that she walked away with 
a new perspective on the issue.

“There is often a very narrow-

minded view on this really 
complicated subject and in reality 
there are so many different 
elements and components to it,” 
Fueka said. “I thought this was 
really enlightening and useful for 
me to hear.”

Public Policy junior Graham 

Steffens said he attended because 
he is part of the Michigan 
Journal of International Affairs 
Club and has a strong interest in 
foreign policy.

“Russia’s actions are a big 

deal right now and I think it’s 
really important for students 
to actually listen to what actual 
professors have to say about it 
instead of just talking back and 
forth and not understanding 
everything,” Steffens said.

O

n an average day, I leave 
my apartment at 8 a.m. 
and walk to my 9 a.m. 

class 
that 
is 

located 
roughly 

10 minutes away 
from where I live, 
15 if I’m walking 
slowly. More often than not, when I 
reach the halfway point to my des-
tination, I start to worry if I forgot 
class materials or if I locked the door. 
I shrug my backpack off my shoul-
der and dig through it to see if I have 
everything. I do. I always do, because 
I always pack my backpack the night 
before to make sure that I don’t for-
get anything. Even though I know I 
have everything that I could possibly 
need, I check anyways. Ok, phew, I 
have everything.

But did I lock the door?
I then backtrack to my apart-

ment to make sure I remembered to 
lock the door — and I did, because I 
always do. I rustle the bronze knob 
of the door a few times to reassure 
myself that I had, in fact, locked it. I 
restart my journey to class, but still 
arrive more than 20 minutes early, 
which is my version of being on time. 
I am constantly worried about arriv-
ing late to class. 

There are days when I am expect-

ed to contribute to group discussion 
in class. When it is my turn to speak, 
my heart races and my skin blotches. 
Words fall out of my mouth at 100 
miles a minute. I know that no one is 
judging me, but I become frustrated 
because it’s impossible for me to 
slow down and collect my thoughts. 
Creating coherent responses seems 
impossible. The nervousness never 
ends, and I have accepted it as a part 
of my life and my identity. General-
ized anxiety disorder impacts my 
daily routine and my everyday life.

Students across campus are affect-

ed by generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD). While some students are all 
too familiar with generalized anxi-
ety, I have noticed that others may 
have misconceptions about general-
ized anxiety, or may have not been 

exposed to the concept of general-
ized anxiety before college. I hope 
that my perspective on GAD can 
prove to be helpful to those who may 
be affected by GAD, and interesting 
to those who are curious about gen-
eralized anxiety.

Expressing a small amount of 

anxiety isn’t a bad thing, and expe-
riencing anxiety is common when 
faced with a critical or stressful 
situation. As described by the Anx-
iety and Depression Association of 
America, people with GAD display 
excessive worry about everyday 
things, such as health, family or 
work. Individuals with GAD may 
not be able to perform their normal 
routine. For example, some people 
may be unable to rest or accomplish 
daily tasks because their anxiety is 
so severe. There are diverse treat-
ment plans for GAD; some plans 
include medication and some do 
not. People express anxiety differ-
ently, so it is important to under-
stand that not everyone shares the 
same symptoms for GAD.

I would like to address a miscon-

ception about generalized anxiety 
that I have encountered on campus. 
A common piece of advice that I 
have overheard being given to some-
one who is affected by GAD goes as 
follows: “Your schedule is causing 
your anxiety.” It is true that anxiety 
is a heavy weight tethered to a stu-
dent, and it is true that it may hold 
a student back from performing his 
or her best in social or academic 
situations, but academics and social 
situations are not the cause of GAD, 
even though they may accentuate 
expressed symptoms. GAD is caused 
by brain chemistry or genetics.

Initially, I was discouraged from 

seeking treatment. In my experience, 
because my mental illness wasn’t a 
visible ailment, it wasn’t taken seri-
ously. I was told to put my big girl 
pants on, to push through it. The sec-
ond semester of my freshman year, 
I pushed myself to the point where 
I couldn’t perform everyday activi-
ties. So, I scheduled an appointment 

with my primary care physician. 
The appointment proved to be help-
ful, and I feel that my condition has 
improved with treatment.

I feel that anxiety has been so 

normalized across the nation that it 
is hard for students to seek the right 
treatment or to tell the difference 
between a normal amount of anxi-
ety and general anxiety disorder. 
It often takes a long time for some-
one with GAD to come to the point 
where he or she is comfortable seek-
ing help, and even then the quality 
of help that he or she can receive is 
very limited to the type of insurance 
that he or she possesses. 

I would like to commend the Uni-

versity Counseling and Psychological 
Services for its services and com-
mitment to helping students. In the 
future, I hope CAPS will work on 
providing more available psychiatric 
services to students as anxiety is a 
pressing issue on campus.

While I encourage students to 

visit CAPS for an initial consulta-
tion, I recommend they find a pri-
mary care physician in Ann Arbor if 
at all possible. CAPS services are in 
high demand, and, in my experience, 
students will be able to receive help 
more quickly if they visit a therapist, 
psychiatrist or other specialist that is 
recommended to them by a primary 
care doctor. 

It is never too early to ask for help 

if you feel overwhelmed with school, 
work or anything in general. I think 
the most important thing to remem-
ber is that everyone exhibits differ-
ent symptoms of mental illnesses, 
and every student should feel com-
fortable asking for help no matter 
the severity of his or her symptoms. 
I hope mental health services will 
start to become more widely avail-
able as more people acknowledge 
the reciprocal relationship between 
mental and physical wellness — 
which both have equal influence on a 
person’s overall well-being.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

As the cheers of football season fade and 

the holiday lights dim, the winter semester is 
upon us. For many of us, a new semester comes 
with heaping amounts of stress. Unfortunately, 
stress is this University. Student life can be 
overwhelming when trying to balance school, 
work and a social life, all while trying to be a 
“leader” and “best” at everything.

Stress has become so integral to campus cul-

ture that its harmful effects can sometimes be 
overlooked. According to a 2010 UCLA study, 
the reported emotional health levels of Ameri-
can college students are at a “record low.” 
Furthermore, it is particularly disturbing that 
college students are the least likely group to ask 
for help regarding mental health issues. The 
silence on mental health has become a danger-
ous norm and only perpetuates the problem.

Wolverine Support Network is a student 

organization that strives to directly combat the 
silent mindset on mental health. Over the past 
two semesters, Wolverine Support Network 
has directed a total of 21 weekly confidential 
peer-to-peer groups that have fostered discus-
sion on mental health.

“It is one hour a week where students can 

talk about what they need to and know that 
they will feel welcomed,” Cheyenne Stone, 
director of marketing for WSN, said.

Contrary to some misconceptions about 

the organization, the weekly groups are not 
therapy sessions. Though the WSN leaders 
are trained weekly by Counseling and Psy-
chological Services, the purpose of groups 
is to build relationships and start the con-
versation on mental health. Likewise, the 
group discussions are open to all and are not 
only reserved for students with diagnosed 
psychological problems.

Having been a group leader since WSN’s 

inception, I consider the weekly groups to be 
like an open forum. WSN offers a rare opportu-
nity in this gigantic university to truly under-
stand a few students on a deeper, intimate level. 

“I want to have WSN be a release for stu-

dents; somewhere they can go and to decom-
press and feel good about where they are at in 
life,” Alex Gaggino, director of outreach for 
WSN, said.

Though the groups can be a space to talk 

about anxiety, depression and the stresses 
of student life, groups are not limited to 
those topics.

“Our WSN groups are a chance for people 

to either say, ‘You know what, it was a really 
hard week,’ but also a place where you can 
take a step back and say, ‘Wow look at all these 
awesome things I’m doing,’ ” Gaggino said. 

Each group is a space to reflect; a refresh-

ing change from fast-paced, stressful stu-
dent life.

To date, WSN has raised $80,000 to fur-

ther its cause to destigmatize mental health 
and establish itself as a strong, supportive 
community resource on campus. Last year, 
WSN worked in partnership with Active 
Minds for the Send Silence Packing event 
and with the Depression Center for the 
Defeat Depression Dash 5K. WSN continues 
to collaborate with other mental wellness 
organizations, and the directors of WSN 
will be panelists for the University Mental 
Health Symposium this semester.

Whether you are experiencing emotional 

difficulty this semester, want to meet new 
people or simply want someone to talk to, 
Wolverine Support Network is a resource 
available to you. We are founded on the motto 
“because life happens” because we believe 
everyone is entitled to a support system.

“I see WSN being a resource on campus 

that all students are aware of and a majority of 
students utilize,” Stone said. “We are a com-
munity that promotes wellness and friend-
ship, and I see this community flourishing on 
the University of Michigan campus.”

This was written on behalf of the Wolverine 

Support Network by Rachel Johns, a member 

of the group’s Outreach Comittee.

T

he most important con-
versation I’ve had since 
coming to college hap-

pened my sopho-
more year in my 
friend Kim’s clut-
tered dorm room. 
We were drink-
ing tea: me out 
of a mug shaped like Kanye West’s 
head, her out of a toilet mug. Some-
how Reaganomics — the Reagan 
administration’s policy of govern-
ment deregulation coupled with 
cuts to taxes and spending — came 
up in conversation, and we began 
discussing how effective they were. 
Eventually, we came to an impasse 
where neither of us knew enough 
about the subject to really continue 
the discussion. Thus, we did what 
any intrepid college student would 
have done: We took out our iPhones 
and began trying to discover the 
effects of Reaganomics.

Like 
any 
good 
liberal, 
Kim 

Googled “negative effects of supply-
side economics,” and I, like any good 
contrarian, searched for the “posi-
tive effects supply-side economics.” 
We threw statistics about economic 
growth and happiness indexes back 
and forth until we realized this 
wasn’t a fruitful conversation. Nei-
ther of us were proficient in eco-
nomics, so we couldn’t parse the raw 
data ourselves, and instead we tried 
to simply find arguments that sup-
ported our views. Instead of trying 
to have an open conversation, both 
of us were more interested in prov-
ing we were right.

Obviously, people are going to 

disagree with ideas that run coun-
ter to their opinions. What made 
this conversation so enlightening 
was the realization that we self-
censored information with which 
we didn’t agree. This intentional 
selection of information limits our 
ability to discover the truth about 
how the world works.

Researchers refer to this purpose-

ful selection of information as a type 
of cognitive bias. Cognitive biases 
can manifest themselves in other 
insidious ways. Consider global 
warming. Many environmentalists 
assume that if more people under-
stood the science behind climate 
change, more people would believe 
it’s happening. Fundamentally, this 
makes sense. If you explain to some-
one how the Earth cannot be flat, 
they will (hopefully) stop believ-
ing it’s flat. Unfortunately, this isn’t 
the case. A recent study by Dan M. 
Kahan at Yale University shows that 
conservatives who have a greater 
understanding of science are less 
likely to believe in global warming 
than conservatives who are less flu-
ent in science. The more information 
a person has, the more someone can 
twist that information to confirm 
their preexisting beliefs. This gets 
back to the heart of the Reaganom-
ics discussion. If a deeply liberal 
person had a wealth of knowledge 
about supply-side economics, they 
would be much more likely to reject 
its utility. Similarly, if an arch-
conservative had the same amount 
of information, they might over-
state the power of supply-side eco-
nomics and staunchly support its 
implementation, regardless of the 
economic context.

This bias is exacerbated when we 

surround ourselves with like-mind-
ed people. The conflict between 
Israel and Palestine is one of the 
most contentious on Earth. It there-
fore shouldn’t be a surprise that 
when one researcher graphed how 
Palestinians and Israelis used social 
media, there was almost no interac-
tion between the two groups. This 
increases polarization between pro-
Israel and pro-Palestinian groups 
and makes it more difficult to reach 
consensus. Thus, intergroup inter-
action happens less frequently and 
doesn’t affect change as much. 
When I see a discussion between 
the prominent conservative thinker 

Dinesh D’Souza and the anti-war 
activist Bill Ayers billed as a “show-
down,” or see people tweeting they 
are part of team Ayers, I worry that 
a similar phenomenon has happened 
at the University. This is one of the 
few formal discussions between 
liberal and conservative thinkers. 
We aren’t interested in learning 
about differences between these 
two ideologues. Instead, we want 
our opinions to be vindicated.

Maybe some of my peers aren’t 

worried about this. Many students 
at the University might say they are 
open to discourse. But when the time 
comes for open debate, we twist our 
facts to prove our point rather than 
risk changing our views. I’m very 
liberal, but I don’t reject all conser-
vative beliefs a priori. Since coming 
to college, I’ve come to understand 
the merit of some strains of conser-
vative thought. That’s a key part of 
going to college: engaging with the 
other. If we continue down this path, 
these engagements will be less valu-
able and less frequent. That isn’t the 
sort of university I envision when I 
think of “the leaders and the best.”

There are a couple of ways to 

tackle this issue. The first: actively 
engage people who disagree with 
you. Don’t try to win an argument, 
try to understand the beliefs that 
underpin other people’s worldview. 
Secondly, research has shown that 
being aware you hold these biases 
can limit their power. The Univer-
sity should incorporate lessons about 
cognitive biases into English 124/125 
courses, helping students evalu-
ate arguments only on their merit. 
There’s a lot of work to be done to 
disrupt our biases, but it’s reward-
ing; by removing our biases, we can 
create a more intellectually nurtur-
ing environment at the University 
and become more thoughtful, holis-
tic thinkers.

Don’t try to win an argument

W

ith 39 seconds left in 
the first half, Mark 
Donnal cleanly 

blocked 
Rasheed 
Sulaimon and 
left him lying 
under the 
basket on his 
back. But then 
Maryland 
grabbed the 
offensive 
rebound, 
so Donnal 
jumped up to 
do it again.

This time, he reached his 

arm over forward Robert 
Carter’s shoulder, blocking him 
from behind. On the following 
possession, with time about to 
expire, Donnal tipped in a missed 
3-pointer. His teammates mobbed 
him on the way to the locker room, 
happy to escape the first half 
against the third-ranked Terrapins 
with an eight-point lead.

Fast-forward to the end of the 

second half, and Donnal was at 
the center of attention again. 
After grabbing an offensive board, 
he drew a foul on a put-back 
attempt. With just a two-point 
lead, his two 
free throws 
would mean 
everything to 
his team’s fate.

After he 

sank the 
first one, the 
crowd let out a 
collective sigh 
of relief. At the 
end of a game 
the Wolverines 
mostly dominated, including 
a 13-point lead in the opening 
minutes of the second half, 
Michigan would beat a top-five 
team for the first time since 2014.

After the buzzer sounded and 

the team was done celebrating at 
center court, Donnal went over 
to the sidelines to give out high-

fives — this time connecting not 
with a ball headed towards the 
net, but with fans standing on the 
court and with 17-year event team 
member Jim Dick. Donnal was 
grateful to escape with a win.

Who was Donnal, anyway? A 

skinny, 6-foot-9 big man who lost 
his starting job not just once, but 
two years in a row?

Prior to his breakout game 

against Illinois on Dec. 30, he 
was averaging 3.9 points and 2.1 
boards per game and was known 
for looking timid on the court. In 
his third game starting for the 
Wolverines since then, he has 
looked like the leader he should 
be as one of Michigan’s oldest, 
healthy players. Maybe he’s no 
longer the kid we thought he was.

And who’s Duncan Robinson? 

Is this the same kid we met when 
he transferred from Division 
III Williams College and sat on 
the bench last season? Time and 
time again Tuesday, the redshirt 
sophomore delivered.

Five times from beyond the arc, 

if we’re being specific.

Robinson started to hit his 

stride with 4:26 left in the first 
half, hitting his second trey 
in three possessions. He sank 

another one for 
good measure 
two minutes 
later, scoring 
back-to-back 
with junior 
forward Zak 
Irvin.

He came 

out in the 
second half 
on the same 
stride, scoring 

Michigan’s first points of the half 
in the form of — you guessed it — 
a 3-pointer. It was his longest of 
the game, about a foot away from 
the navy block ‘M’ at center court.

Later, Robinson made up for a 

missed wide-open corner triple 
on the next possession by running 
beneath the net and laying the 

ball in on a reverse layup. It gave 
Michigan a much-needed boost 
and awakened the crowd, giving 
the Wolverines a 61-57 lead.

And how about Zak Irvin and 

Derrick Walton Jr.?

Well, they’re faces Michigan 

fans know well, but they’ve 
never seen them like this, in 
more of a leadership role than 
ever before. 

With leading scorer and 

captain Caris LeVert sidelined 
due to a lower leg injury, Irvin 
and Walton had to play those roles 
Tuesday if they wanted a chance. 
“Best friends” off the court, the 
duo showed that they have just as 
much chemistry on the court. 

Walton dished the ball to Irvin 

for Michigan’s first points of the 

game, and the trend continued, 
with the two on the floor together 
for nearly all of the Wolverines’ 
big runs.

Irvin led the Wolverines with 

22 points, and though Walton 
didn’t make quite as big of a dent 
on the box score, the guard came 
up big with 10 rebounds. In fact, 
Irvin thinks his buddy Walton is 
the best rebounding point guard 
he’s ever played with.

On top of grabbing boards at 

6-foot-1, Walton was tasked with 
the unenviable job of guarding 
Melo Trimble, Maryland’s leading 
scorer. He held Trimble to just two 
points in a matchup that he said he 
made personal, and after the game, 
Michigan coach John Beilein had 
him lead the Wolverines in singing 

“The Victors.”

It’s hard not to imagine 

what the Wolverines would 
have looked like Tuesday night 
with LeVert. It’s even harder 
not to make comparisons to 
last season’s injuries. Beilein 
even catches himself doing it 
sometimes.

“I’ve done it, everybody’s done 

it — ‘Here we go again, same 
thing as last year,’ ” Beilein said 
following the game. “You’ve got 
Spike sitting there and you’ve got 
Caris sitting there. 

“I think the Penn State game 

really showed that we have some 
other weapons. They also love 
playing with Duncan Robinson — 
they’re looking for him all the time 
… I think they’re understanding 

there’s a lot of ways to win, not just 
if Caris isn’t there, we can’t win. 
We’ve done it twice now.”

Even without LeVert, the 

Wolverines proved they could 
hang out with the big kids — 
quite literally at times, with two 
of Maryland’s big men measuring 
in at 6-foot-11. Michigan finally 
drew on its strengths, all of them, 
and used a slew of weapons that 
were more or less nonexistent 
just months ago when everyone 
was still waiting on Robinson 
and Donnal. 

There’s no more waiting now, 

though. These kids have made it.

“I think they’re 
understanding 
there’s a lot of 
ways to win.”

Henry will enter 
2016 NFL Draft

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

After a strong 2015 season, 

redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Willie 
Henry 
announced 
on 

Twitter Wednesday night that 
he will forgo his final year of 
eligibility with the Michigan 
football team and enter the NFL 
Draft.

“We’ve had a long exciting 

journey together,” Henry said to 
Michigan coaches, teammates 
and fans in a statement on 
Twitter. “For the past few years 
at the University, all of you have 
been like a second family to me.

“Nevertheless, my time as a 

student athlete has come to a 
end. I have decided to continue 
my football career in a more 
professional direction.”

In his third season playing 

on the 12th-ranked Wolverines’ 
front, the 6-foot-3, 311-pound 
Henry had career highs in tackles 
(34), tackles for loss (10) and sacks 
(6.5). His 6.5 sacks were tied with 
redshirt junior Chris Wormley 
for the team lead.

In back-to-back games against 

then-No. 13 Northwestern and 
then-No. 
7 
Michigan 
State, 

Henry totaled nine tackles, 5.5 
tackles for loss and four sacks, 

showcasing improved speed that 
could make him ready for the 
next level.

Henry was an integral part on 

one of the nation’s best defensive 
lines and led the Wolverines to 
their most wins since 2011.

In his letter, Henry credited 

the coaching staff and support 
around him for making his 
dream possible.

“I 
want 
to 
express 
my 

gratitude to all of the coaching 
staff that I had the pleasure of 
working with throughout my 
time here at Michigan,” Henry 
said. “This began with the 
coaching staff that was here with 
Brady Hoke (who is a great man 
and mentor) and the coaching 
staff that is here now whom I had 
the benefit of sharing my most 
memorable season.

“So, to Michigan, I say goodbye 

knowing you all have given me an 
experience of a lifetime that I will 
cherish forever.”

Though Henry is leaving, 

other potential NFL players 
such as junior tight end Jake 
Butt, redshirt junior defensive 
back 
Jourdan 
Lewis 
and 

Wormley have all committed 
to playing one more season for 
the Wolverines, who could still 
return up to 16 starters.

Junior forward Mark Donnal came up big in key moments in the Michigan men’s basketball team’s 70-67 win over No. 3 Maryland on Tuesday.

Season in review: linebackers

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Editor’s Note: With the Michigan 

football team’s 2015 regular season 
in the books, the Daily looks back at 
the performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the future 
in 2016. In this edition: linebackers.

Of the players Jim Harbaugh 

inherited for his first season 
as Michigan football coach, no 
group was more seasoned than 
the linebackers.

The Wolverines returned two 

experienced players, seniors Joe 
Bolden and James Ross, from a 
unit that was already one of the 
team’s strengths in 2014. Despite 
losing their third starter, Jake 
Ryan, to graduation, they found a 
worthy replacement in fifth-year 
senior Desmond Morgan, who 
had been a starter before missing 
the 2014 season with an injury.

Few 
questions 
remained 

unanswered. Bolden, Ross and 
Morgan carried the load for 
the entire season, proving their 
consistency. As a strong force 
in the middle of one of the best 
defenses in the country, the 
linebacker corps allowed the 
defense to flourish.

The 
one 
change 
for 
the 

linebackers in 2015 was their 
coach. D.J. Durkin came in for one 
year as defensive coordinator and 
linebackers coach, and the group 
didn’t miss a beat.

In the season opener, Utah 

rushed for 127 yards and two 
touchdowns against Michigan 
— not disastrous numbers by any 
means. But they proved to be out 
of the ordinary for the Wolverines’ 
defense. Over the next six weeks, 
Michigan gave up just 54.3 yards 
per game on the ground and didn’t 
allow a rushing touchdown again 
until Week 7.

The linebackers’ consistency 

showed in their numbers: Bolden 
finished with 83 tackles, Morgan 
with 71 and Ross with 35. Each 
of them recorded a stop in every 
game, and they combined for 14 
tackles for loss.

They leave Michigan the same 

way they started the season — as 
the most experienced group on 
the team. With 86 career starts 
between them, they used their 
experience to their advantage, 
ending with a Citrus Bowl victory 
against Florida.

HIGH POINT: The linebackers 

don’t garner as many individual 
statistics as the defensive linemen 
and defensive backs do with sacks 
and interceptions, respectively. 
Their success generally coincided 
with the overall defense’s success, 
which reached its peak in the first 
half of the season during a stretch 
in which the Wolverines allowed 
14 points in five games, three of 
them shutouts.

In that span, there were 

individual highlights as well. 
Morgan intercepted a pass at 
Maryland on Oct. 3, and Bolden 
recovered 
a 
fumble 
forced 

by junior defensive end Taco 
Charlton and returned it 18 yards 
against Oregon State on Sept. 12. 

Outside of those, the linebackers’ 
success showed through their 
consistency, 
rather 
than 
any 

highlight-reel plays.

LOW 
POINT: 
In 
the 

second half of the season, as 
Michigan’s run defense faded, the 
Wolverines’ flaws were exposed. 
They gave up 307 rushing yards 
against 
Indiana’s 
up-tempo 

spread offense and 369 more in 
a blowout defeat against Ohio 
State to end the regular season. 
A defense that appeared deep, 
powerful and disciplined earlier 
in the season looked worn down 
when November came.

THE 
FUTURE: 
The 

linebacker corps will go into next 
season as unproven as it went into 
this season experienced. Bolden, 
Morgan and Ross will all depart, 
leaving holes in the defense — 
perhaps some of the only ones on 
the field for the Wolverines. The 
three seniors ate up most of the 
reps for Michigan this season, 
meaning the rest of the depth 

chart is uncertain. Just four 
other linebackers played snaps 
this season: junior Ben Gedeon 
(34 tackles in 12 games), redshirt 
freshman Noah Furbush (four 
tackles in nine games) and redshirt 
freshman Chase Winovich and 
redshirt junior Allen Gant (two 
tackles in six games each). Gedeon 
could lead the unit, and junior 
Mike McCray will return from 
injury, but the Wolverines still 
have major ground to make up.

Michigan has more options 

in terms of personnel coming in. 
Four-star recruit Devin Bush, an 
early enrollee from Hollywood, 
Fla., could help immediately. 
The Wolverines have also given 
redshirt defensive end Reuben 
Jones reps at linebacker and could 
do the same with one of their 
many other linemen. And it’s also 
possible that another young player 
such as redshirt freshman Jared 
Wangler could step up. Michigan 
has plenty of time to find answers, 
but it will need a few of them.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Linebacker Joe Bolden finished his senior season with 83 total tackles, most of any Wolverine this season.

Quick Hits with 
‘M’ defenseman 
Zach Werenski

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

It’s been roughly a month since 

the inaugural edition of Quick 
Hits, but now it’s time for round 
two.

The Daily caught up with 

sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 

Werenski to discuss reindeer, 
the dab and the time he spent in 
Finland for the International Ice 
Hockey Federation World Junior 
Championships.

The Michigan Daily: We 

haven’t had a chance to talk to 
you much about World Juniors. 
What was the experience of going 
overseas like?

Zach 
Werenski: 
It 
was 

unbelievable. You hear so much 
about it, and for me, at 17, I 
only went overseas once — to 
Sweden. It was only my second 
time overseas and I was there 
for almost a month. It’s just 
unbelievable to be there. You 
get so comfortable staying in a 
different country.

TMD: Did you have a lot of 

down time to go sightseeing?

Werenski: Yeah, every off 

day we had a day to do whatever 
we wanted. We went down to 
Helsinki, go walk around, go 
shopping, stuff like that. It was 
awesome.

TMD: Any favorite moments 

or a favorite part of the city?

Werenski: Just being there 

with all your friends, just walking 
around and seeing (Finland’s) 
culture.

TMD: How was the food?
Werenski: (Pause) Different. 

I’m not going to say it’s not good, 
but it took us a while to get used to 
it — a lot of pasta.

TMD: You’ve been picking it 

up defensively — which you have 
always said is one of the strengths 
of your game — since you’ve come 
back from World Juniors. Did 
you learn anything over there, or 
is it just a matter-of-time sort of 
thing?

Werenski: I think I just came 

back with a lot of confidence. I 
thought I went over there and 
played well, against the supposedly 
best players in the world. It was 
definitely a confidence booster. 
For me, just learning from Chelios, 
who was the D coach, the little 
things he points out helped me a 
ton. I’m coming back with a lot of 
confidence.

TMD: You’re getting a lot of 

love for the celebrations. What 
inspires them?

Werenski: I don’t really know. 

Well, the violin was Carl Hagelin. 
He did that in The Big Chill. I 
thought that playing Michigan 
State here at home, it’s the closest 
thing I’ll get to The Big Chill this 
year. That’s why I did it. I don’t 
know if coach liked it too much, 
he made a comment about it.

TMD: You have any other ones 

(coming up)?

Werenski: I’ve been thinking. 

(Michigan 
spokesman 
Jeff) 

Weinstein put me on the spot 
with a tweet saying, “What’s 
next?” I’m thinking of something 
to do next.

TMD: Are the guys giving 

you any hate for it? They seem to 
prefer the fist pump.

Werenski: No, I think none 

of the guys have a problem with 
it. I think I’m the only one that’s 
really gone overboard and done 
something different than just a 
fist pump, but I think the guys 
like it.

TMD: Hey, a goal is a goal 

right?

Werenski: Yeah. Enjoy it.
TMD: What about the dab? 

Did you take it from Cam or was 
it spur of the moment?

Werenski: I learned that from 

Cam Newton, and then when I 
went to World Juniors, I wanted 
to take it overseas. I told the guys 
that as a joke. I never thought 
I’d actually score in the Canada 
game. When I did, I said, “I’ve got 
to do it now.”

TMD: Just to go back to 

Finland — you talked about the 
food. What’s the weirdest thing 
you tried over there?

Werenski: Reindeer probably.
TMD: That’s gamey. Was it 

gamey?

Werenski: I don’t even know. 

It just said reindeer on (the menu). 
Maybe the name threw me off 
and I didn’t want to eat it, but it 
was all right.

TMD: Talk about Christmas 

spirit, huh?

Werenski: 
(Laughs) 
Yeah, 

seriously.

TMD: Any guys there give you 

crap for your American accent?

Werenski: No, I don’t think 

so. Most people over there speak 
broken English, but I didn’t really 
hear anyone say I had an accent.

TMD: Did you hear any weird 

phrases typical to Finland?

Werenski: I only learned one 

phrase in Finland. It was thank 
you — “kiitos.” It’s all I learned. 
It’s the most common thing there, 
to say thank you to everything.

The Daily caught sophomore 

forward Dexter Dancs coming off 
the ice to find out if it’s actually 
true that the team is enjoying 
Werenski’s 
latest 
celebration 

tactics.

TMD: How does everyone feel 

about 
Werenski’s 
celebrations 

lately?

Dexter Dancs: About his 

Hagelin (impression)? (Laughs) 
We were having a lot of fun with 
that. He did the dab a couple 
weeks ago, and we were kind of 
giving it to him, like, “What are 
you going to come up with next?” 
And he came up with (the violin). 
I wish I had the skill to do that.

TMD: I saw you called him 

“Captain Dab” on Twitter. Is that 
sarcasm or giving him some love?

Dancs: I was just kind of giving 

it to him. He’s such a good player, 
he can do things like that. We’re 
really excited he’s back.

TMD: 
Do 
you 
have 
any 

suggestions 
for 
the 
next 

celebration?

Dancs: I have no suggestions. 

I’m sure he’s going to come up 
with something.

TMD: You have anything 

planned? You’ve been scoring.

Dancs: No, no, no. I’m just 

going to stick to hands up in the 
air.

Freshman center Hallie Thome will be tasked with another tough post matchup when Malina Howard and Maryland visit Crisler Center on Thursday.
Wolverines seek to keep streak alive

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team needs a big win.

Plain and simple as that. The 

Wolverines (2-2 
Big Ten, 10-5 
overall) 
have 

that 
chance 

Thursday night, 
hosting 
No. 

8 
Maryland. 

Realistically, 
Michigan’s 
chance is slim 
— 
it 
hasn’t 

beaten a ranked 
opponent 
this 
season. 

Nonetheless, 
the Wolverines 
need the win to boost their 
postseason hopes.

As difficult as a victory over 

the Terrapins (3-1, 14-2) could be 
for the Wolverines, the matchup 
couldn’t come at a more perfect 
time.

Michigan rides a thrilling 

two-game 
win 
streak 
that 

includes a 17-point comeback and 

a road victory. The Wolverines 
bounced back to shock Iowa 
after falling to 0-2 in conference 
play. Confidence is high, and the 
chance to play a top-10 team adds 
to the excitement.

“Maryland is a tremendous 

team, and they have a tremendous 
program,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico in an interview 
with WTKA on Tuesday. “They 
went to the Final Four last year. 
Year in and year out, they are one 
of the best teams in the country. … 
I know our kids will be excited for 
that one. Should be a fun game.”

The 
Terrapins 
have 
the 

advantage in nearly every aspect, 
but the Wolverines’ best chance 
lies in getting Maryland’s post 
players in foul trouble early. 
Center Malina Howard is only 
one of the Terrapins’ options 
in the post, where she and her 
teammates will match up with 
Michigan 
freshman 
center 

Hallie Thome.

“(Maryland) has great size, a 

dominating post presence inside, 
a 6-5 kid (Howard) that’s probably 
got about 50 or 60 pounds on 
Hallie,” Barnes Arico said. “So 

that’s going to be a tough matchup 
for us inside.”

Thome’s height — also 6-foot-

5 — has become less impactful as 
the season has progressed. The 
Wolverines have faced bigger and 
more physical opponents so far in 
conference play, and Howard is a 
continuation of that.

If Michigan can get Howard 

off the court, Thome will have the 
chance to dominate in the paint.

Outside on the wings, Maryland 

guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough 
is even more dangerous. Walker-
Kimbrough, a 2015 All-Big Ten 
First Team recipient, is averaging 
11 points and 5.3 rebounds. She 
can do a little bit of everything, 
Barnes Arico noted, whether 
that’s filling the rim from outside 
or driving to the basket.

The guard duel pits Walker-

Kimbrough 
with 
Michigan 

sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty. Flaherty is putting up 
22 points per game, good for the 
11th highest in the country, and 
the Wolverines should expect the 
Terrapins to key in on her.

Flaherty continues to score 

more than 20 points per game, 

no matter the matchup, and she 
is in the top 10 in the nation for 
four different categories: points 
per 
game 
(11th), 
free-throw 

percentage (7th), final points 
(15th) and field goals made (9th).

She is leading of a team with 

aspirations to make the NCAA 
Tournament. To do that, they 
need big wins, and they need to 
avoid big losses.

Michigan already has had 

a bad loss, a one-point loss to 
Eastern Michigan, but it has 
yet to overcome a highly-touted 
opponent. It has had its chances, 
too.

Against then-No. 20 UCLA, the 

Wolverines hung around until the 
very end, eventually falling, 86-77.

Michigan’s best win of the 

season so far came against Iowa. 
The Hawkeyes hung in and out 
of the top 25 during the opening 
weeks of the season, but aren’t as 
strong as many of the other Big 
Ten opponents that Michigan will 
face.

A bid to the Big Dance requires 

more than a win over Iowa. A win 
over Maryland, as tough as it will 
be, could be huge.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY’S 
GUIDE TO 
RESTAURANT

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Looking at the Ann Arbor 

Restaurant 
Week 
website, 

it doesn’t really seem like 
there are many choices. But 
then you realize there are 56 
participating restaurants this 
January, and you do some 
math — in order to attend all 
56, you’d have to eat out 11.2 
times every day, and probably 
spend somewhere in the field of 
$1,300.

Plus tip.
Okay, so you can probably get 

rid of some of them — there’s 
never a reason to go to bd’s 
Mongolian Grill; I have never 
walked by Ama Bistro and seen 
more than one person in the 
restaurant; Neopapalis, what?; 
and if you don’t have a car (or 
friends with cars) that takes 
off 
Bigalora, 
Carlyle 
Grill, 

Carson’s 
American 
Bistro, 

Guy Hollerin’s, Mediterrano, 
Metzger’s German Restaurant, 
Old Carolina Barbeque, Seva 
(although, 
if 
you’re 
vegan, 

I would highly recommend 
checking out Seva when you 
get 
the 
chance), 
Weber’s 

Restaurant and Zola Bistro.

So, what’s left, then? Only 38 

restaurants. That takes it down 
to a manageable 7.6 meals out 
per day. Doable, I’d say.

In all seriousness, I have 

developed three main strategies 
to getting the most out of your 
restaurant 
week: 
high-end, 

dabbling and procrastinator-
ender.

High-end

The most obvious, but also 

probably the most intelligent 
and the best way to really get a 
good value is to use RW to dine 
out at all the notoriously super-
pricey Ann Arbor restaurants 
that you would normally only go 
to for a super special occasion, 
or when your parents come into 
town.

The Earle (classified under 

“T” on the RW website), is one 
such 
place. 
Normally 
their 

entrees 
by 
themselves 
run 

anywhere from $26 to $28, but 
during RW, you can get a three 
course meal for $28. (This is 
the standard pricing for all 
restaurants during the week. 
$15 for lunch and $28 for dinner 
across the board, although 
some restaurants have a two-
for-one deal on this — two for 
$15 or two for $28.)

“We will give you exactly 

the same food,” said Dennis 
Webster, owner of The Earle. 
“We don’t cut down on the 
quality of the food. We don’t 
reduce the portion size. We try 
to be very honest about what it 
is.”

The same goes for Logan, 

practically next door to The 
Earle. Thad Gillies, chef and 
owner, touted his restaurant’s 
dedication to providing both 
quality food and the same 
dining experience one would 
get outside of RW.

Another reason to go high-

end is to experience what the 
food culture has to offer.

“What you’re getting here 

is a chef driven restaurant — a 
partner 
driven 
restaurant,” 

Gillies said. “There’s a lot of 
passion behind what we do. This 
is our little baby. You’re going 
to get a different experience.”

James Wilhelm, Black Pearl 

executive chef, echoed these 
sentiments.

“This place is a lot more 

attainable 
or 
inviting 
than 

people think it is … they get in 
and they realize it’s actually 
worth it,” Wilhelm said. “This 
is the place I can come to and 
know that I’m going to get the 
bang for my buck. I feel like 
that’s what a lot of people worry 
about, that they’re going to go 
to a restaurant, have a bad meal 
and spend a fortune. Nobody 
wants that.”

However, while The Earle 

and Logan keep their dishes 
the same, Black Pearl does alter 
its portion sizes to make up for 
the cost difference. Instead of 
the normal eight-ounce piece 
of meat, Wilhelm said it’s about 
six ounces during RW.

“We’re 
not 
changing 

anything because of Restaurant 
Week,” he said. “Maybe the 
portion size a little bit, but 
other than that, it’s still the 
same piece of fish.”

Pros: You get to try something 

you might not have been able to 
afford otherwise, you get a cool 
experience at a high-end, one-
of-a-kind restaurant and you 
get to dress up.

Cons: You might not be 

getting exactly what you would 
be during a non-RW visit, you’ll 
still probably spend a fortune 
on alcohol and you might have 
to dress up.

Other high-end restaurants 

to try: Aventura, Blue Nile, 
Gratzi, The Chop House (also 
under “T”) and Vinology.

Dabbling

Very different from dabbing, 

the dabbling concept involves 
going 
to 
the 
cheaper 
RW 

restaurants and trying a bunch 
of them. The best way to do 
this is the two-for-one deals, 
leaning toward lunch if you 
can to get the highest value. 
This way, you get to try a bunch 
of new restaurants without 
breaking the bank.

Conor O’Neill’s, for example, 

offers two-for-one pricing on 
both lunch and dinner, but 
their dinner spread includes 
appetizer and dessert samplers, 
where you get three smaller 
portions of each to try. Plus, as 
long as both guests are 21, you 
also get a beer sampler. Thank 
you, Conor’s.

“If you’re hungry, it’s the 

place to come. You get a lot of 
food,” said Micheal Dineen, 
manager and chef at Conor 

O’Neill’s.

With this method, you might 

not get to try the greatest, most 
original Ann Arbor restaurants, 
but there’s still a wide variety 
of Ann Arbor-only restaurants 
to choose from.

While 
not 
every 
RW 

restaurant offers lunch, the 
RW website has a nifty button 
that sorts all the restaurants by 
lunch or two-for-one. So, if you 
don’t want to limit yourself to 
the 24 places that offer two-for-
one deals, you can limit yourself 
to the 40 that offer lunch.

Pros: You get to try a lot of 

places; you can hang out with 
a lot of different friends (or 
Tinder dates) and you’ll spend 
relatively little money.

Cons: 
It 
takes 
a 
pretty 

moderate amount of effort, 
friends (or Tinder dates) can 
be annoying and if you go out 
enough, you can actually end up 
still spending quite a bit.

Other dabbling restaurants 

to try: Blue Tractor, Grizzly 
Peak, Marnee Thai, Sava’s and 
Slurping Turtle.

Procrastinator-ender

Have you always wanted to 

venture to Main Street but were 
too lazy and ended up eating at 
BTB instead? Have you always 
thought it would be cool to eat 
at an Ethiopian restaurant but 
couldn’t find someone to go 
with you to Blue Nile? Have you 
always been curious if you could 
actually get into Heidelberg 
without getting carded but it 
was just too far away? Have you 
heard about the exotic truffle 
fries at Jolly Pumpkin but never 
wanted to pay the extra two 
dollars for them? Hey, it’s RW! 
Here’s your chance.

The 
most 
obscure 
RW 

strategy, procrastinator-ender 
involves using RW as your 
excuse to actually go eat at 
places.

In creating his menu for RW, 

Matthew Morrison, executive 
chef at Jolly Pumpkin, said 
while he did put special items 
on the menu for the occasion, 
Jolly’s menu changes seasonally 
and he wanted to showcase 
that. He also made sure to 
choose some things that are on 
the regular menu and highly 
popular, like truffle fries.

“The most popular things on 

our menu are stuff that people 
already know about … truffle 
fries are like the greatest thing 
since sliced bread,” he said.

Pros: You get out of the 

house, you get to eat something 
besides Jimmy John’s and you 
get a new experience.

Cons: None?
Other 
procrastinator-

ender restaurants to try: BD’s 
Mongolian Grill (just kidding), 
Sava’s (if you’ve never been 
there), The Original Cottage 
Inn and The Ravens Club.

The point is, try RW. There’s 

awesome food, and it doesn’t 
shut down half the streets in 
downtown like Art Fair.

reshman year of high 
school, I felt the urge 
to start playing an 

instrument. I always admired 
people who could play the piano, 
so I decided to take it up and 
hopefully learn a song or two, 
create some sort of relationship 
with the instrument. I was 
hoping it would become a 
close friend, more than just an 
occasional visit.

I 
remember 
my 
living 

room being taken over by a 
huge Steinway piano when 
I was about seven or eight. 
I 
recognized 
it 
from 
my 

grandma’s house and didn’t 
give it much of a thought 
beyond its enormity taking up 
a huge portion of the room. 
Those are my early memories 
of the instrument I had so long 
neglected.

In freshman year, my musical 

theater-obsessed self realized 
that my interest in piano was 
becoming quite serious. It was 
time to start developing my 
skills.

I began learning simply by 

watching others play. I was 
fascinated by what I saw and 
honestly 
regretful 
that 
I’d 

taken so long to recognize such 
amazing talent. Then there I 
was, in my living room, rolling 
out the bench of my piano — in 
time, a place I would visit daily.

My 
observations 
quickly 

led to application. I found 
some of my sister’s old piano 
books, from when she took 

formal lessons (prior to my 
instrumental revelation, so I 
never participated in those) 
and began matching the keys 
to letters, learning how to 
move my fingers to each key. 
I’m forever grateful for the 
patience of my family during 
this experimental stage; I can’t 
imagine anything I was playing 
was pleasant to listen to.

These 
beginner 
lessons 

were followed by hours spent 
watching people on YouTube 
play popular songs and talk 
through tutorials. I ditched 
my beginner piano books for 
my own head and began with 
Adele. Listening to songs on 
the radio encouraged me to go 
home and try to play them. It 
was a mixture of learning the 
notes on paper and playing by 
ear. As I spent months doing 
this, I started to learn a lot 
about myself.

Learning 
an 
instrument 

teaches you much more beyond 
just how to play the instrument 
itself. Music is a form of escape 
and relaxation, and as I learned 
more, I began to notice patterns 
in my own behavior. If there 
was 
something 
I 
couldn’t 

figure out, like how to move 
my fingers from one note to 
the next properly, I would have 
to repeat the process a million 
times until it felt easy. Patience 
was something I had never been 
able to develop in any other part 
of my life, until I was sitting 
there at my piano bench.

I feel like most things I’ve 

ever learned to do in my life 

have been guided by some 
sort of set way of teaching 
and learning. You learn how 
to read through established 
techniques, you learn a new 
language from an instructor in 
an organized fashion. But piano 
was entirely up to me. I had to 
decide what worked best for 
me. Watching, listening, taking 
notes, reading practice books 
— there were so many options, 
and through a series of trial and 
error, I found what worked. If 
I couldn’t figure out a rhythm, 
I would just listen. If I didn’t 
know how to move from one 
note to the next, I would watch. 
I learned to teach myself how to 
teach myself.

Learning 
the 
piano 
also 

broadened the scope of my 
appreciation for art. As a singer, 
I 
always 
focused 
narrowly 

on vocals. I could appreciate 
talented artists, classmates and 
teachers, but piano was always 
something in the background 
— until it became something 
that I was absolutely enthralled 
by. Not only was I aware of the 
talent of singers I listened to, I 
was equally enamored with the 
piano accompanying them.

What I love most about 

this hobby is that it’s a work 
in progress. But so am I. I’m 
constantly 
learning 
more 

about myself, noting what my 
strengths are and what needs 
to improve. Piano is the same 
way. It’s a parallel to my life. It 
takes time to figure out what 
brings the most satisfaction and 
enjoyment. But we’re all aiming 
to get there.

So thank you to my freshman 

year self, who decided it was 
time for a new hobby. The 
benefits continue to reward me.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 “I love God, I love speed, I 
love drink, I love me / I love 
oceans in the deep, I love 
money, I love me.” God, I love 
Kendrick too. With a boogie-
woogie intro, 
heavy-hitting 
drums and a 
tight band, 
“Cornrow 
Kenny,” as he 
so calls him-
self, basks in a 
pale spotlight, 
rapping about 
mystical “blue 
faces.” The 
rapper never fails to deliver 
a stunning performance, and 
the performance on Fallon 
is no exception — but what 
makes the performance so 
spectacular isn’t the theatrics, 
rather its lack thereof. The 
reserved rendition of “Unti-
tled 2” (save the explosive 
ending) relays a subtle, honest 
and important intimacy that 
can be thought to define much 
of the artist’s late work.
 While often the mix from 
late night shows is lacking, 

Fallon made sure not to disap-
point when Kendrick came 
on — both the band and vocals 
were appropriately leveled. 
The Roots, major players in 
the track, are unafraid to 
interact with Kendrick as 
he rapped over their groove. 
Piano lines float atop the 
track, playing off Kendrick’s 
rhythm and dancing over 
the bar line and through the 
changing time signatures. 
The piano adds to the mix 
an improvisational flare, 

inherited from jazz, the music 
from which Kendrick’s recent 
music is so inspired. How-
ever present the band might 
be, they remain cast in the 
background, save metallic 
shimmering from guitars and 
cymbals. Their submersion in 
the darkness behind the front-
man provides an unsteady 
atmosphere that brings fur-
ther tension to the cutting 
lyrics. Kendrick Lamar, once 
again, is the complete pack-
age. -DANIEL SAFFRON

I love most that 

it’s a work in

New year, new loves: 
Emma Jayne’s EP

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

It’s a new year, a new me and 

that means I’m on the hunt for 
new music. While I may not be 
ready to return to the dreary 
world of essays and deadlines, 
I 
recently 
stumbled 
across 

singer/songwriter Emma Jayne 
whose music has made the 
transition back to class much 
more bearable.

Sounding like the lovechild of 

Jason Mraz and Sara Bareilles, 
Jayne utilizes her ukulele and 
a cappella skills to create her 
own unique style. Jayne gained 
her start on YouTube and is 
still producing videos for her 
7,000 subscribers, with just 570 
monthly listeners on Spotify 
currently. 
Despite 
her 
lack 

of recognition from popular 
media, Jayne’s lyrics never 
stray from musings on finding 
herself, being fine on her own 
and traveling on her own 
individual journey.

Her most recent EP, Oh What 

a Life, was released in 2014 and 
opens with “Connie,” a happy-
go-lucky tune guaranteed to 
turn your bad day around. 
“Connie” 
primarily 
consists 

of upbeat ukulele strumming 
and whistling, sounding like 
a summer song in the midst of 
this drizzly winter. (Seriously, 
what is the deal with rain in 

January?) It speaks to idealizing 
another person and stepping 
outside of your comfort zone 
when Jayne sings, “I’m just like 
her, besides one tiny, little thing / 
I write my songs and play them / 
But Connie really sings.”

A strangely syncopated and 

piano-based song, “Rich Love” 
is heavily reminiscent of Regina 
Spektor. Jayne reflects on her 
past loves and what she wants 
from the future, singing, “I want 
a rich love / That you can’t see 
in the movies.” The next song, 
“Dialogue with God,” is a bare 
and honest account of all her 
wrongdoings. With only her 
voice and her ukulele, it is short 
and sweet, forcing you to reflect 
on what your own internal 
dialogue entails.

“Tandem Bike” is upbeat and 

jazzy, featuring self-empowering 
lyrics like, “So I’ll put on my 
high heels / Baby, I will learn to 
walk,” and “Tandem bike? / I’m 
fine on my own,” to encourage 
the listener to make decisions 
to benefit her own happiness. 
Rapper 
Hologram 
Kizzie 

features on a verse that only adds 
to Jayne’s liberating foundation. 
The song finishes with Jayne 
singing a cappella, showing off 
her whimsical and charming 

voice.

“Ten Twenty Nine” slows 

things down and speaks of a 
true 
love 
without 
reverting 

to unreachable ideals. It is 
an 
honest 
account 
of 
her 

own experiences when she 
reminisces, “’Cause you tell me 
when I’m out of line / You see 
through me when I’m doing just 
fine.” Backed only by her piano 
and a violin, Jayne showcases her 
voice on this ballad.

The closing song, “Oh What 

a Life,” opens with swelling 
violins before fading to simple 
vocals and a ukulele. Featuring 
stripped down versions of the 
instruments heard in the opening 
song, “Oh What a Life” brings the 
listener full circle. She looks to 
the future without losing sight 
of the past, singing, “I remember 
there’s tomorrow left for you and 
I to waste / Then I smile, then I 
swear that I grow wings.” Raw 
and pure, Jayne’s closing track is 
a poignant way to end the EP.

While Emma Jayne may not 

have the most subscribers or be 
the most popular, Oh What a Life 
speaks to universal experiences 
without feeling clichéd and 
emphasizes empowerment and 
happiness. And in the end, what 
more could you really need?

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Freshman year, 
I felt the urge 
to start playing.

“I want a rich 
love / That you 
can’t see in the 

movies.”
Oh What a 
Life speaks 
to universal 
experiences.

It’s a new year, a 

new me.

Eve Aronoff takes 
over the Bell Tower 
Hotel’s first floor.

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO 

Daily Food Columnist

In the early 1990s, when Eve 

Aronoff was in college just 
outside of Boston, she took a 
summer job as a hot dog vendor 
at Fenway Park, the home of 
the Boston Red Sox. If you met 
Aronoff today, you’d have trouble 
imaging the soft-spoken person 
in front of you climbing up and 
down stadium steps hawking 
franks. With two successful 
Ann Arbor restaurants under 
her apron, she’s clearly come a 
long way from that. But she still 
hasn’t forgotten what Fenway 
meant to fans — it was more than 
somewhere to sit. It was a place, 
and it was fun. She kept that in 
mind for over a dozen years until 
the time came to open her own 
restaurant, eve.

“I wanted a place where my 

passion for food and attention 
to detail was combined with an 
anything-goes atmosphere,” she 
told me recently, sitting in the 
luminous dining room of her 
new restaurant in the Bell Tower 
Hotel.

When I arrived in Ann Arbor 

in 2012, I’d occasionally hear sad 
whispers about eve. Opened in 
2003, the Kerrytown location 
quickly became a town favorite. 
It was so popular, Aronoff 
opened up a Cuban-burger joint, 
Fritas Batidos, and even got 
recruited by the producers for 
the sixth season of Top Chef, set 
in Las Vegas.

Suffice to say, Aronoff’s luck 

wasn’t great in Vegas. In the 
days leading up to the show, she 
broke her foot, her father was 
hospitalized, she cut her finger 

open packing her knives and 
the producers spelled her name 
wrong on the flight reservation, 
delaying her departure. Oh, and 
she got eliminated in the second 
episode.

“It was an interesting life 

experience, I’ll give it that,” she 
laughed.

But her luck truly took a 

turn for the worse in 2011. In 
Honduras, where she was doing 
charity work building ovens for 
rural communities, she severely 
injured her back. Unable to work 
the line anymore or even expedite, 
she was forced to close eve. 
Understandably, Ann Arborites 
mourned the loss of what had 
become a Kerrytown fixture.

“It was a very personal place,” 

Aronoff 
said. 
“People 
were 

invested in it as a food community. 
It was a bit off the beaten path. No 
one was really going to just wander 
in, because we were closed during 
the day when Kerrytown was 
busy. People made a point of going 
there.”

eve had been the culmination 

of years of work, both in other 
Ann Arbor kitchens, and even 
shops like Monahan’s Seafood. 
Aronoff, who eventually attended 
Le Cordon Bleu Paris, had for a 
time converted Ann Arbor into her 
own culinary school. Right after 
closing eve, her back and resolve 
still ached.

“For a brief time, I was like ‘I’m 

never doing that again,’ ” she said.

But a few weeks later, she was 

eyeing empty spaces around Ann 
Arbor. After two years, a suitable 
space arrived on the ground floor 
of the Bell Tower Hotel on South 
Thayer, just across the street from 
the main part of Central Campus. 
In February of 2015, she signed 
a lease, and started designing a 
new restaurant with assistant 
Architecture Prof. Neil Robinson. 
After months of slog, the new eve 

opened on Dec. 4 of last year.

Sitting with Aronoff in the new 

dining room just the other day, I 
commented on the unusual decor, 
full of icicle-looking lights, shades 
of pearl and bone-white and the 
occasional glisten from the still-
shiny liquor bottles neatly lined up 
at the bar.

“It looks like the Snow Queen’s 

Palace,” I quipped.

“Exactly!” Aronoff exclaimed. 

“I wanted it to feel like you were 
walking into Narnia.”

At the sleek white bar, a curious 

little herb garden seems to grow 
right out of the stone. Aronoff 
explains that the bar manager at 
the original eve had the idea to 
install a small patch of live potted 
herbs into the bar so he could pluck 
them to order. When she decided to 
revive eve, Aronoff installed a bar 
garden. But that’s not all she took 
from the old restaurant — many 
of the original staff members have 
returned to work at the new eve. 
However, Aronoff insists that this 
new South Thayer location isn’t a 
facsimile of the Kerrytown one.

“It’s 
evolved. 
I’ve 
evolved 

as a chef and as a person,” she 
explained.

But Aronoff also insists that the 

new restaurant is not just about her 
vision and image.

“When people tell me ‘you have 

a brand,’ it just makes me cringe,” 
she said, tightening her face and 
shrugging her shoulders up.

“So why is the restaurant called 

‘eve’?” I asked, a bit puzzled.

“Because it’s not ‘Eve’ with a 

capital ‘E’!” she exclaimed, excited 
to correct what is clearly a common 
misperception. 
“It’s 
lowercase. 

I was thinking the first woman, 
twilight, the Garden of Eden.”

Eve didn’t leave Ann Arbor after 

her injury. And it seems like “eve” 
didn’t either. Instead the soul of 
it lay waiting, like a seed ready to 
bloom again after a harsh winter.

SINGLE REVIEW

 If the media coverage following 
most superstars is a circus, the 
firestorm that comes with Kanye 
West is an 
apocalypse. In 
the years pre-
ceding Swish, 
Yeezy has cer-
tainly fanned 
the flames. He 
married into 
the breeding 
ground of 
celebrity gos-
sip and has 
since announced that he’s run-
ning for president in 2020. Good 
ol’ Kanye.
 For better or worse, this means 
that the release of a new Kanye 
West album is pushed by an 
enormous hype train. The wheels 
relentlessly turned in 2015. 
“Wolves” — Kanye’s best track 
of the year — invited lengthy 
features about the continued rel-
evance of 808s and Heartbreak 
while “All Day” led to fervent 
speculation that there was a new 
Yeezus on the way.
 “FACTS,” released at the turn of 
the year, was a worrying sign that 
perhaps all the hype had finally 
gotten to Kanye, weighing on him 
with overblown expectations. It’s 
one of his worst tracks to date, a 
mess of “fuck Nike” and recycled 
production from the year before. 

The pressure of his media per-
sona is so obvious that the track 
seems almost like a satire. With 
the dominance of rappers like 
Kendrick and Drake looming, for 
a moment it seemed the A.D.H.D. 
brain of hip-hop was moving past 
Kanye.
 But this is Kanye fucking West. 
He knows what he’s doing. And 
because this is Kanye, we get 
“Real Friends,” a track (and a 
snippet) that instantly blows away 
all of his musical clutter in 2015.
 The beat opens up immediately, 
shutting out everything else. The 
rhythmic pulsing and angelic 
synths command your attention, 
and for good reason, because 
Kanye is about to lay out some of 
his best and most vulnerable bars 
in years.
 On 808s and Heartbreak, Kanye 
yearned for a family, an escape 
from the loneliness. In 2016, now 
married with two children, he has 
everything he wanted back then, 
but that loneliness — no, solitude 
— is still there. On “Real Friends,” 
Kanye blames himself for failing 
to keep touch with those close to 
him (I guess I get what I deserve, 
don’t I? / Word on the streets is 
they ain’t heard from him), but 
also recognizes that most aren’t 
there for him anyways (To 3 A.M., 
callin’ / How many real friends? 
/ Just to ask you a question / Just 

to see how you was feelin’ / How 
many?). It’s so personal and uni-
versal that you can’t help but look 
at your own life. Are your friends 
truly there for you? Will they be 
there when the “wheels don’t 
spin?” It’s hard to tell.
 It’s the same self-awareness 
that made his masterpiece My 
Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 
so powerful, and the similarities 
between the road to Swish and 
the road to MBDTF are hard to 
ignore. Sure, there’s the obvious: 
G.O.O.D. Fridays are back. But 
the off-cuff rants, the escalating 
rumors, the changing album title 
and the odd interviews are all 
more potent reminders of that 
troubled Kanye we had before 
MBDTF.
 A snippet of “No More Parties 
in LA” follows “Real Friends,” 
and it’s the ultimate tease, finally 
revealing the Kendrick-Kanye 
collaboration. Here, Kanye is sick 
of the gloss and glam of LA life. 
The track is smooth and chilled, 
but still teaming with funk 
energy. This is, apparently, one of 
the five beats that Madlib gave to 
Kanye for MBDTF, furthering the 
connection so far between it and 
Swish.
 So what’s all of this going to 
lead to? When Swish releases on 
February 11th, we’ll finally see. -

To escape the fast-paced 

campus life, veer a few blocks 
south for a traditional bistro 
style dining experience in the 
Zola 
Bistro. 
Drop-hanging 

spotlights, industrial design-
influenced bar shelves and 
a gold, textured wall glow 
invitingly — a sleek finish to a 
classic dining experience.

The menu, too, takes the 

French bistro concept — a local 
eatery with simple, wholesome 
meals — and modernizes it, 
citing culinary inspiration from 
all over the world.

“When you come to our 

restaurant you see things from 
all over, not just one country,” 
owner Alan Zakalik said.

Zakalik 
comes 
from 

Poland, bringing a Northern 
European 
influence 
to 
the 

menu. His wife and restaurant 
co-owner 
Hediye 
Batu’s 

Turkish 
background 
adds 

Mediterranean flavor.

“It may be from the Far East, 

or Italian, or Spanish, and we 
try to make sure that it blends 
together well on the menu,” he 
said.

While its older sister Café 

Zola, located in the downtown 
area, has earned recognition 
for 
its 
eclectic 
menu 
and 

décor, Zola Bistro differs in 

its homier, more approachable 
feel. The regular menu features 
reoccurring nightly specials 
— braised short ribs, paella 
or a Greek seafood stew. Both 
the Café and the Bistro will 
be participating in Restaurant 
Week with a special multi-
course dinner menu.

Expect 
Zola 
Bistro’s 

Restaurant Week selection to be 
a variety sampler representing 
everything the restaurant does. 
Their Restaurant Week dinner 
menu offers an incredibly wide 
variety of choices. For starters, 
one can select from mussels, 
quinoa 
cakes, 
lamb 
kofte 

meatballs, 
crab 
cake, 
fried 

chickpeas and more, all cooked 
in 
sauces 
influenced 
from 

different parts of the world. 
Some of the highlights for the 
main course include Moroccan 
salmon, flatiron steak with 
chimichurri 
sauce, 
farfalle 

kale and good old-fashioned 
spaghetti topped with Zola’s 
famous meatballs.

“I like to think of it as a world 

feast — you can really try many 
different things,” Zakalik said.

Zola 
Bistro 
also 
offers 

a 
special 
lunch 
menu 
for 

Restaurant 
Week, 
featuring 

their farmhouse omelette, lamb 
kofte, chicken salad sandwich, 
wild rice and French lentil 
burger, among other options.

Zakalik and Batu said the 

Ann 
Arbor 
community 
is 

integral to their experience as 

restaurateurs.

“To own a restaurant in Ann 

Arbor has become part of the 
fabric of my life,” Zakalik said. 
“It’s not just a … business; we’re 
involved in different aspects of 
the town itself.”

In addition to being involved 

with local farmers and food 
producers, Zola Bistro partners 
with 
the 
food 
bank 
Food 

Gatherers. During Restaurant 
Week, 
proceeds 
from 
the 

Kenrick’s crepe will be donated 
to the charity.

Zakalik 
said 
he 
enjoys 

connecting 
with 
the 
local 

community 
through 
the 

restaurant, reminiscing about 
students that have worked at 
Zola and then come back to visit 
after they’ve jumpstarted their 
careers.

He’s especially excited for 

how 
Restaurant 
Week 
can 

introduce new diners to the 
passion he has for Ann Arbor’s 
culinary community.

“Restaurant Week, at night, 

brings a lot more young people 
to this side of town, so I think 
it’s a good thing to expose to 
students of the university,” he 
said.

If you brave the cold this 

upcoming 
week 
(and 
you 

should), Zola Bistro and Café 
Zola will welcome you with 
open arms and a full plate. Bon 
appetit!

SMTD showcases
Collage collaboration

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

This weekend, the School 

of Music, Theatre and Dance 
will present their 39th annual 
Collage 
Concert at Hill 
Auditorium, a 
tradition 
that 

began at the 
University 
in 

1977.

This 

“collage” 
is 

exactly 
what 

it 
sounds 

like, a piecing 
together 
of many different kinds of 
performances into one cohesive 
production. For School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance sophomore 
Eliana 
Barwinski, 
the 

concert is all about one thing: 
collaboration.

“The 
Collage 
Concert 
is 

a 
culmination 
of 
different 

performances from all three 
sectors of the School of Music, 
Theatre and Dance,” Barwinski 
said. “It’s really an evening to 
open one’s eyes to the variety 
of our art forms and get to 
participate 
with 
us 
in 
the 

exploration of collaboration.”

She 
said 
the 
production 

includes performances from all 
different disciplines, featuring 
soloists, smaller acts and larger 
ensemble pieces, as well as acts 
that bring different disciplines 
together. This year there are 
about 15 student performances 
and 12 ensemble performances, 
including band, choir, jazz and 
orchestra.

“There’s just so much talent, 

so when an audience member 
goes to see the performance, they 
get to have such an enriching 
experience seeing not only just 
singing or just opera, but they 
get to see theatre in the works 
and they get to see dancing,” 
Barwinski said. “It’s a really cool 
collaboration, and it shows how 
not only does each part possess 
their own individual talent, but 
actually how we collaborate as a 
school.” 

Conducting 
Prof. 
Eugene 

Rogers, director of the Men’s 
Glee Club, is co-artistic director 
of the Collage Concert, along 
with Jazz prof. Ellen Rowe. In an 
e-mail interview, Rogers wrote 
that the concert’s unique ability 
to move seamlessly between all 
different kinds of performance 
is what makes it the school’s 
biggest event of the year.

“The 
Collage 
Concert 
is 

captivatingly 
distinctive 
and 

features the incredible range 
of 
SMTD 
ensembles 
and 

departments 
performing 
one 

riveting 
work 
after 
another 

without pause,” Rogers wrote. 
“It’s a non-stop evening of 
virtuosic performances. No other 
concert features the breadth and 
depth of the entire SMTD.”

Barwinski said she believes 

the concert will be appreciated 
by all students, even those 
outside of the SMTD.

“Since 
this 
is 
our 
most 

popular performance and it 
usually does almost sell out, we 
try to make student tickets as 
available as we can by bumping 
the price down from $28 to $12, 
and you have your Bert’s tickets, 
which are free for any freshman 
or sophomore,” Barwinski said.

Rogers 
agreed 
that 
the 

range of performances means 
the concert can appeal to all 
students.

“I am always moved and 

impressed by the level of talent 
that 
our 
students 
display 

everyday, but especially on this 
concert,” he wrote. “It makes me 
proud to be a Wolverine! If any 
student at U-M has never had the 
chance to experience this concert, 
it’s a must see before leaving this 
campus, and it only happens once 
a year in January.”

Daily Arts Writer

We all know To Pimp A Butterfly 

and Currents, but 2015 was a pretty 
impressive year for rock music 
too. However, many musicians 
have shown concern that rock 
music is dying out, arguing that 
rock bands aren’t getting the 
attention 
they 
deserve. 
Just 

this year, Billie Joe Armstrong 
slammed the music industry 
with two tweets in reaction to 
the MTV VMAs. Armstrong, like 
myself, was disappointed that 
the VMAs didn’t feature even 
one rock ‘n’ roll band. He went 
on to argue that there are several 
young rock bands headlining 
music festivals, yet none of those 
bands were featured on one of the 
most televised nights in the music 
industry.

Armstrong has a valid point. 

Most of the music that is 
highly publicized and known 
by the mass public is pop and 
rap; this isn’t to say that pop 
and rap are inherently worse 
than 
rock 
music, 
however 

there is a certain emotion and 
importance to rock music that 
other genres can’t possibly 
emulate. The lack of widespread 
media attention paid to rock 
bands is just one example of 
how they’re not getting the 
homage they deserve. In the 
Daily’s Best Albums of 2015, 
with the exception of Courtney 
Barnett, not one album could be 
considered full-on rock. Sure, 
Tame Impala is “psychedelic 
rock,” but I personally consider 
them 
more 
indie-alternative 

than anything else. Aside from 
maybe Tame Impala, not one 
rock band made our Top 10 list. 
Of course each album on the list 
is great, but why don’t people 
have 
as 
much 
enthusiasm 

about the fucking phenomenal 
rock albums that dropped in 
2015? Is it that, because these 
albums 
aren’t 
mainstream, 

no one picks them as the best 
music of 2015? Are these bands 
not talked about enough to be 
considered the best of the year? 
Truthfully, I don’t know. But 
what I do know is that 2015 saw 
an amazing year for rock music; 
below I have included my own 
Best of 2015 list, but this time 
only rock music is presented 
to you. I hope you take the 
time to listen to each album 
because they’re important and 
marvelous and will get you 
hyped for the resurgence of 
rock ‘n’ roll.

1. Mister Asylum — Highly 

Suspect

I’m guessing that 90 percent 

of you don’t know of Highly 
Suspect — I didn’t, at least, until 
my best friend incessantly went 
on about how she interviewed 
the most bad-ass, talented band 
the other night. She went on 
to play their debut album for 
me, Mister Asylum, on repeat 
until I, too, became addicted 
to Highly Suspect. The Cape 
Cod natives have made quite 
the first impression with their 
debut album seeing that they 
are nominated for Best Rock 

Album and Best Rock Song 
at the 58th Annual Grammy 
Awards. The ten-track album 
is pure rock genius; it’s angsty, 
raw, full of emotion and an all-
around stand out album. My 
personal favorites are “Bath 
Salts” and “Mom.” One piece 
of information that I gathered 
from my friend’s interview 
with the band is that all of their 
songs are literal. “Bath Salts” is 
about the time Johnny Stevens, 
the lead vocalist, tried bath 
salts and “Mom” is about his 
mom. You know what you’re 
listening to is real, and I think 
in a day and age when so much 
of what we hear is warped and 
fake, listening to an honest yet 
complex album is rare. It also 
doesn’t hurt that the Stevens 
wears gold Chanel nail polish; 
any man who rocks nail polish, 
let alone Chanel nailpolish, is 
an ace in my book.

2. Yours, Dreamily — The Arcs

Usually when members of a 

band take on side projects, fans 
get worried that this will be the 
demise of the original band. In 
the case of Dan Auerbach, his 
side project, The Arcs, turned 
out to be a massive success — 
arguably a project that could be 
just as big as The Black Keys. 
The band has been on tour pro-
moting their debut album and 
they’re lined up for Coachella 
this April. Of course The Black 
Keys are alive and well, but hav-
ing not one but two successful 
rock bands is an impressive feat 
for a young guy like Auerbach. 
Yours, Dreamily clearly outlines 
how The Arcs differ from The 
Black Keys — The Arcs contains 
more soul and blues than Auer-
bach’s previous work. My favor-
ite song on Yours, Dreamily is 
easily “Pistol Made of Bones.” 
It’s a smooth, catchy classic 
with a rhythm that stands out 
from the other songs that com-
prise the album. In truth, I love 
every song on the compilation. 
Every song is memorable, and 
to me, that’s a telling sign of a 
truly great album. 

3. Wasted On A Dream — Jeff 

the Brotherhood

When I interviewed my fave 

Cleveland band, The Moxies, 
they made a huge point to lis-
ten to Jeff the Brotherhood, so 
I did. I found their music to be 
mesmerizing; it contains ele-
ments of psychedelic and garage 
rock, making for a unique blend 
of guitar chords and other 
crazy instrumental components 
that would be difficult for any 
other band to replicate. What I 
love most about this Nashville 
duo is their ability to blend dif-
ferent instruments into every 
song. For example, in “Black 
Cherry Pie,” my favorite song 
on the album, the flute makes 
an appearance in the intro and 
has its own solo moment mid-
way through the song. Modern 
music almost never utilizes the 
flute, which makes this band 
and album so unique. They 
aren’t afraid to experiment, and 
the result is an album one could 

never tire of.

4. Tell Me I’m Pretty — Cage 

the Elephant

For some reason, I feel like 

Cage’s 
latest 
album 
hasn’t 

gotten a lot of attention. I don’t 
know why, though, because it’s 
fabulous and Cage is fabulous. 
Tell Me I’m Pretty is infinitely 
more 
sophisticated 
than 

Melophobia 
and 
the 
band’s 

other earlier work; I would go 
so far as to say this album rocks 
even harder. “Sweetie Little 
Jean” is definitely one of the 
best songs off of the album — it 
sounds very Arctic Monkeys-
esque, which is never a bad 
thing. Personally, my favorite 
songs are easily “Too Late To 
Say Goodbye” and “Cold Cold 
Cold.” The former is full of 
sadness and passion while the 
latter is slightly more upbeat 
and heavy on the classic rock 
sound — dare I say reminiscent 
of The Rolling Stones. Actually, 
the more I listen to this album, 
the more I realize that I could 
pick any one of these songs as 
my favorite. That’s just how 
pretty Tell Me I’m Pretty is.

5. That’s The Spirit — Bring 

Me The Horizon

There were many albums I 

considered for the last spot on 
my Top 5 Best Rock Albums of 
2015 list. I considered The Cribs, 
Modest Mouse, or Courtney 
Barnett, but finally, I decided 
to take a risk and include Bring 
Me The Horizon. I’ve seen 
Bring Me The Horizon perform 
live on several occasions, and 
each 
time 
I’ve 
temporarily 

lost my hearing. They are 
first and foremost a hard rock 
band from England. They are 
often lauded by Alternative 
Press and are highly regarded 
as the less-extreme chaps of 
the post-hardcore/hard rock 
community, which is why I was 
surprised when my “Discover 
Weekly” on Spotify featured 
one of their songs. I was 
listening to “Follow You” and 
jamming out — and then was 
shocked when I looked at what 
band I was listening to. Bring 
Me The Horizon didn’t scream 
at all during “Follow You.” It 
sounded nothing like them — 
it was lovely and strange all at 
the same time. I chose That’s 
The Spirit as my last pick for 
2015 because I think Bring Me 
The Horizon has a tremendous 
amount of potential as a rock 
band — they’re already an 
amazing hard rock band, but 
I think there’s a lot to be said 
for a vocalist and artist who 
can easily transition between 
rock and harder, borderline 
metal 
music. 
Additionally, 

the lead vocalist, Oli Sykes, 
has 
important 
messages 
in 

each song given his battle 
with 
addiction. 
His 
words, 

combined 
with 
his 
sound, 

are unparalleled in any other 
modern rock music; I get that 
hard rock isn’t for everyone, but 
I think it’s an underrated genre 
that should get more attention 
than it currently does.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Fear and loathing 
at Totoro, alone

By ADAM DEPOLLO

Daily Arts Writer

French 
philosopher 
Michel 

Foucault once said “people know 
what they do; frequently they 
know why they do what they do; 
but what they don’t know is what 
what they do does.”

The final part of that quote — 

about people not knowing what 
what they do does — reveals some-
thing important, I think, about the 
experience of being an American 
person in the 21st century. We tend 
to think of ourselves as more or 
less fully in control of our thoughts 
and actions — that at our best (and 
at our deepest, most fundamental 
level) we are fully self-aware, self-
actualized, 
self-controlled 
and 

self-motivated individuals, wad-
dling around our allotted patch 
of existence and doing things that 
have a limited set of prescribed 
outcomes which are completely 
under our control.

Hence the logic of the Iraq War:
Step 1: Military intervention to 

depose dictator

Step 2: Freedom, Democracy, 

National Self-Determination 

Or the logic of Long John Sil-

ver’s:

Step 1: Make a Super Sampler 

with 4,610 mg of sodium

Step 2: Freedom, Consumer 

Capitalism, Dietary Self-Determi-
nation

This logic assumes, of course, 

that the Waddling Individual 
is humanity’s natural essence, 
and that, after having removed 
whatever obstacle might impede 
their waddle, the Individuals will 
resume their natural course and 
plod onward toward a state of 
sublime self-sufficiency embody-
ing the highest ideals of Liberty, 
Equality and the Pursuit of Hap-
piness. And despite the fact that 
actions we take based on this 
assumption usually leave our Wad-
dling Individuals fleeing from ISIS 
forces until they collapse in the 
dust from a hush puppy-induced 
stroke, we’re reluctant to put an 
asterisk on unfettered individual-
ism because, you know, freedom.

But one of the biggest problems 

with our refusal to question indi-
vidualism can be felt much closer 
to home. Namely, it prevents us 

from seeing that there really is no 
such thing as “freedom” in and of 
itself. It’s a relative term — there’s 
only ever freedom from some-
thing, liberation from some form 
of oppression. The same goes for 
the idea of an “individual” — you 
can only ever be an individual 
when there are a large number of 
people somewhere who aren’t that 
(sheeple, squares, phonies, etc.). 
And since we all like to think of 
ourselves as individuals all the 
time, that leaves us perpetually 
lumping the rest of humanity into 
a sort of incoherent blob which is 
really only there to remind us that 
we aren’t it. 

At this point, a properly self-

aware individual might be asking 
him or herself whether it’s pos-
sible to actually be an individual 
and also believe that everyone 
else on the planet is also an indi-
vidual at the same time. If we’re all 
individuals, after all, then doesn’t 
that mean we’re all just sheeple 
with illusions of grandeur? If you 
do something — anything — that 
might suggest to another person 
that you are, in fact, an individual, 
aren’t you really just telling them 
that they’re part of the herd? And 
if you take this line of thinking to 
its logical conclusion, then, when 
you get right down to it, interact-
ing with another person in any 
way whatsoever is a lot like forc-
ing them to acknowledge that you 
exist, i.e. that you are enough of an 
individual to warrant being differ-
entiated from the physical space 
that you occupy, the implication 
being of course that they are, by 
virtue of your existence, a sheep.

And so, if you’re a real Ameri-

can who believes wholeheartedly 
in the value of individualism as 
a universal ideal, I think it’s safe 
to say that the only truly ethical 
way to practice your individual-
ism is to avoid, as much as possible, 
doing anything that might suggest 
to another person that you are, in 
fact, an individual. 

Now, if you haven’t already 

guessed, I’m a vegetarian for moral 
reasons. I’ve taken the cliché “you 
are what you eat” to heart and real-
ized that the daily choice of what 
and how to consume is really, in 
our consumerist culture, a test of 
faith — an unending trial by fire 

where we see whether our person-
al integrity is able to withstand the 
constant temptations of cost and 
convenience.

And that’s why, when I’m look-

ing to put my patriotism and faith 
in American individualism to the 
test, there’s only one way to eat: 
alone. And the best place to do that 
in Ann Arbor is, without question, 
Totoro on State Street.

Totoro is a bastion of dignified 

solitude, where each meal is per-
fectly choreographed to require 
the least amount of verbal con-
tact with the wait staff, minimiz-
ing the number of times that you 
might be required to suggest to 
another person that you aren’t a 
piece of furniture and maximizing 
your opportunities for silent self-
reflection.

After walking into the res-

taurant, you’ll only be asked two 
questions, which can be answered 
with as few as two words: “How 
many?” (one) and “Anything to 
drink?” (no). Having suffered 
that necessary evil, you can make 
your sushi order by simply plac-
ing unimposing checkmarks next 
to the appropriate selections on 
a piece of laminated paper. The 
meal comes with complimentary 
soup, salad and an Andes after-
dinner mint. But if, like me, you 
order vegetarian, the wait staff 
will, without asking, refrain from 
bringing you the miso soup (made 
with fish broth), saving you from 
the nearly insurmountable moral 
quandary of deciding whether a 
minor breach of your vegetarian-
ism would be a greater or lesser 
evil than bringing the problem up 
to your server.

From then on, your multi-

course meal simply comes to 
your table in regular waves — not 
unlike time itself, which that most 
American individual Henry David 
Thoreau once wrote (anticipating 
the ethical 21st century American 
individualist’s approach to the rest 
of humanity) “is but the stream 
(we) go a-fishing in.” You’re left 
free to eat like the true American 
you are, with the contented silence 
of an unperturbed patriot, staring 
down into your pile of wasabi to 
avoid eye contact with the room 
full of individuals whose freedom 
you’ve done your part to secure. 

Hardcore bands help 
support Toys for Tots

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

Six bands were listed on a 

Facebook page for a Dec. 11 
event that was titled “Mosh for 
a Cause.” I pressed the “inter-
ested” button because, honestly, 
who wouldn’t be intrigued by 
that title? “Mosh for a Cause” is 
a hardcore metal show played at 
Simon’s Bar in Allen Park, Mich-
igan. Six bands come to play for 
free and the admission is eight 
dollars. But, there’s a catch; it’s 
only four dollars if you bring a 
toy.

That’s correct, there is a hard-

core metal show / Toys for Tots 
extravaganza held in one of the 
most mundane places in Michi-
gan. Six bands all cram into a 
tiny bar that sits next to a Dollar 
Tree, and they play their music 
loudly as a crowd of people basi-
cally murders each other — and 
they do this all for free. All of the 
money made (and obviously toys 
collected) goes toward the Toys 
for Tots foundation.

Last year, “Mosh for a Cause” 

was presented by a well-known 
local band manager, Kyle Yoder. 
He had a van full of toys to 
donate and made enough money 
to feed 12 families. From that 
point on Yoder has put on two 
benefit shows and said he was 
excited to throw another Toys 
for Tots show. Once the word got 
out, 30 bands contacted Yoder 
to volunteer for the show this 
year, so the selection was rough, 
but Yoder said he was sure he 
picked bands that would please 

the crowd.

The first band, Of Cities, 

apparently lacked a bassist and 
some of their equipment, but 
that didn’t stop the crowd from 
engaging in a collective head 
nod when the music started to 
scream through the speakers.

The next band was The Major 

Minor and they came as a sur-
prise to everyone. Made up of a 
guitarist, bass player and a bad 
ass female drummer, The Major 
Minor was a pop punk band in 
the middle of a hardcore metal 
show. I guess I never got the 
memo about hardcore defenders 
also taking a liking to some pop 
punk, but the band’s set was well 
appreciated amid the heavier 
music that was played that night.

Following the pop punk was 

Amnesty, who came all the way 
from Canada to do the show. 
Screaming, “Everyone’s a fuck-
ing fake,” the singer’s vocals 
were clean and a few people in 
the crowd started to slam dance. 
I saw some guy that dropped off 
a set of Hot Wheels cars in the 
toy box looking pissed off and 
swinging his arms.

Argus and Change Is were 

the next two bands, and both 
put on a great show. Argus had 
five members and their music 
was clean and well performed. 
I think the crowd was the most 
energized during their set. A 
girl with blue hair started hard-
core dancing with the guys, and 
Yoder got in the pit himself. 
Argus covered “Psychosocial” 
by Slipknot, making the crowd 
go wild.

Like Statues was the head-

lining band. Robert Gibbons, 
the guitarist, spoke on behalf 
of the rest of the band, saying 
they wanted to do a benefit show 
because they “want to give back. 
We want kids to have a better 
holiday 
season.” 
Addressing 

the stereotypes associated with 
hardcore culture, Gibbons spoke 
of breaking down the wall peo-
ple put in front of the hardcore 
music scene.

“People look at us and think 

‘Wow, you’re a terrible person’ 
and they don’t even know us. 
We’re out here doing something 
for a good cause and I hope they 
realize we’re not all terrible peo-
ple,” Gibbons said.

With this inspired feeling 

Gibbons placed in my heart, I 
eagerly watched Like Statues kill 
it. The few words Chris Fortuna 
(front man) said exemplified his 
amazing stage presence, which 
engaged the crowd. Plus, he was 
wearing a Michigan windbreak-
er (Go Blue!). They played songs 
with titles like “Psyche” and 
“Insomnia,” tapping into every-
one’s inner demons. The show 
was great and defied all stereo-
types that this certain group of 
people has placed on them.

So, if I was asked to go to 

another hardcore metal Toys 
for Tots show I’d be there in 
a heart beat. Thank you, Kyle 
Yoder, for having the wonderful 
idea of gathering, in his words, 
“the most pissed off people to 
do a Toys for Tots show,” it was 
definitely one of the most metal 
things I have ever witnessed.
