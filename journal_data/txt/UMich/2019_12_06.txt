About 
20 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
attended 
an 
affordable 
housing 
workshop in the Ann Arbor 
Downtown 
Development 
Authority 
building 
on 
Thursday night. As the 
first of a five-step series of 
workshops, the city of Ann 
Arbor 
and 
SmithGroup, 
an 
urban 
design 
firm, 
gauged the interest of Ann 
Arbor residents in a new 
affordable 
housing 
plan 
the group is developing. 
Affordable 
housing 
is 
defined 
as 
costing 
30 percent or less of a 
household’s gross annual 

income. 
To 
spread 
the 
word 
about 
workshops, 
representatives 
of 
SmithGroup visited various 
University 
of 
Michigan 
classes on real estate. The 
city of Ann Arbor wanted 
to give as many people as 
possible the opportunity 
to participate.
Michael 
Johnson, 
leader of the urban design 
practice 
at 
SmithGroup, 
has taken the lead on 
this project and hopes to 
complete the program with 
the help of the Ann Arbor 
community.
“Our firm is architects, 
engineers, 
landscape 
architects 
and 
urban 
designers, 
and 
we 
get 

to 
work 
all 
over 
the 
country,” 
Johnson 
said. 
“Both 
doing 
design 
exercises 
and 
running 
public 
engagement 
exercises 
and 
working 
with 
neighborhoods, 
communities and cities to 
re-envision what our cities 
might be in the future.”
The workshop consisted 
of three different stations 
in which members used 
virtual reality to visualize 
what the buildings would 
look 
like 
in 
different 
locations. 
The 
location 
options were the former 
Y-lot 
and 
415 
West 
Washington. At another 
station, participants used 
Legos to build potential 
options 
for 
affordable 

housing locations.
Taubman 
graduate 
student Jiawen Qiao is 
taking a class on real estate 
development. She chose to 
attend this event to give 
her a real-life example 
of what she’s trying to 
accomplish in class. 
“We 
are 
actually 
bringing 
about 
some 
apartments,” 
Qiao 
said. 
“And we’re also thinking 
about 
adding 
some 
affordable units into it. So, 
our 
professor 
suggested 
we come to some of the 
committee meetings about 
affordable housing to learn 
more.”

Members of the Climate 
Action Movement and the 
One 
University 
Coalition 
from all three U-M campuses 
joined 
forces 
to 
protest 
before and after the Board of 
Regents meeting on Thursday, 
ultimately 
blockading 
the 
exits following the meeting in 
response to the University’s 
lack of action regarding their 
demands. 
U-M Flint senior Lucine 
Jarrah, a member of One 

University, 
addressed 
the 
crowd 
at 
the 
pre-meeting 
protest. She began by saying 
the University has not listened 
to these student activists and 
has instead actively pushed 
them aside. 
“Over the last year, our 
movements 
have 
been 
actively 
demonstrating 
the 
urgency 
and 
addressing 
the 
drastic 
inequities 
in 
Flint and Dearborn, as well 
as 
establishing 
a 
carbon 
neutrality agreement at the 
University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Jarrah 
said. 
“Instead, 
for months we have been 
consistently sidelined by the 

Board of Regents who have 
been 
dismissive 
in 
every 
opportunity to communicate 
our mission.”
Jarrah said no progress 
has been made in the One 
University 
Campaign, 
and 
while the University says they 
support their cause, no action 
has been taken. 
“Time and time again we 
are seeing the University of 
Michigan deny and reject the 
inequitable conditions on the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses,” 
Jarrah said. “This denial 
has only managed to fuel 
the instability and mistrust 
between our campuses and, 

in the end, students are the 
ones getting left behind. The 
One 
University 
Campaign 
was formed in January of last 
year. It is now almost a year 
later, and we have yet to see 
the results we need ... words 
of solidarity are no longer 
enough. We need action and 
we need it now.”
LSA 
junior 
Solomon 
Medintz, who writes for The 
Daily’s opinion section, was 
the last speaker before the 
board 
meeting. 
He 
noted 
while the big picture goals 
and demands are important, 
the point of the protests at the 
meeting are to get the bare 

minimum of action needed to 
keep the University on track. 
“This is a critical moment, 
and 
we 
haven’t 
gotten 
anything, and we need to 
know that we’re going to 
have a chance of getting our 
big picture goals,” Medintz 
said. “We’re not asking for 
everything 
today; 
we’re 
asking for what is absolutely 
necessary.” 
Medintz then expressed his 
frustrations surrounding the 
University’s decision not to 
take action. He said despite the 
administration voicing their 
support for the movements, 
nothing has happened. 

“Both our movements have 
met with the administration 
and regents dozens of times, 
and although officials have 
said they support our goals, 
they do nothing,” Medintz 
said. 
“They 
do 
absolutely 
nothing. So, we are here to 
say that we are not going to 
be silenced or pushed aside 
anymore.”
LSA junior Amytess Girgis 
told The Daily the University 
is mistreating people of color, 
not only on campus, but around 
the world, because climate 
change 
disproportionately 
impacts minority populations.

Michigan’s largest marijuana 
company recently opened on 
Nov. 15 at 1958 S. Industrial 
Highway in Ann Arbor, about 
a seven-minute drive from the 
University of Michigan’s central 
campus. With the addition of this 
new location, there are now 12 
marijuana dispensaries in Ann 
Arbor. 
Skymint, part of Green Peak 
Innovations company, now has 
four stores in Michigan. The Ann 
Arbor location is housed in a 2,500 
square foot space, and is open from 
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day. 
The 
Michigan 
Marijuana 
Regulatory recently announced 
that, 
beginning 
on 
Dec. 
1, 
residents will legally be able to 
purchase marijuana from stores, 
after its legalization in Michigan 
last year.
The 
store 
was 
approved 
for a recreational marijuana 
license 
last 
week. 
Summer 
Ransom, president of retail for 
Skymint, said the legalization of 
recreational marijuana creates 
a safer and more regulated 
environment for users, who now 
will not have to rely on the illicit 
market for product.

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., joined a bicameral 
delegation to the Madrid Climate 
Convention 2019 on Dec. 2. 
The conference is the 25th 
session of the Conference of the 
Parties. Along with Speaker of 
the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 
and other key Democrats, Dingell 
joined other international leaders 
for a weeklong convention to 
discuss steps forward with the 
Paris Climate Agreement of 2016. 
This was the first time Dingell 
traveled to a Conference of the 
Parties. 
The Paris Climate Agreement’s 
central aim is to “strengthen 
the global response to the threat 
of climate change by keeping 
a global temperature rise this 
century well below 2 degrees 
Celsius 
above 
pre-industrial 
levels.” The treaty was signed on 
April 22, 2016 by 196 state parties. 
Dingell noted the importance 
of staying on track with the 
Paris Climate Agreement, even 
if the Trump administration 
is 
planning 
on 
formally 
withdrawing from the Paris 
Climate Agreement within the 
next year.

Eastern Michigan University 
hosted a discussion panel about 
the impact of the legalization 
of 
recreational 
marijuana 
in 
Michigan on the Ypsilanti and 
Ann Arbor communities. About 
40 community members attended 
the event Thursday night, which 
came less than a week after 
recreational 
marijuana 
sales 
began in the state. The discussion 
touched on plans for racial equity 
in the marijuana industry, new 
drug testing availabilities for 
companies and the dangers that 
can accompany edible marijuana.
The three panelists included 
Tim 
Secinski, 
EMU 
police 
department community relations 

officer, state Sen. Jeff Irwin, 
D-Ann Arbor, and Kevin Boehnke, 
University of Michigan research 
investigator in the department of 
anesthesiology.
Michigan passed Proposal 1 in 
November 2018, which makes it 
legal for people age 21 and older 
to possess up to 2.5 ounces of 
marijuana. Irwin, who served as 
political director for the Coalition 
to 
Regulate 
Marijuana 
like 
Alcohol, which worked to pass 
Proposal 1, said he does not like 
the term “recreational” marijuana 
due to the fact that legalized 
marijuana can often make its 
way into the hands of underage 
consumers. 
“I try to use those terms as 
much as possible, because I 
feel like that’s a more fair and 
accurate way to describe what 

we’re really talking about here,” 
Irwin said. “When we talk about 
it as recreational, which is sort 
of the term that has caught fire, 
it creates a certain connotation 
that is sometimes but not always 
accurate about how people are 
using cannabis.”
Though experts say it is 
nearly impossible to overdose on 
marijuana, legislators still worry 
about the effects of the drug.
Irwin and Boehnke said they 
did not think it was appropriate 
for a company to drug test its 
employees to monitor if they are 
using drugs while at work. They 
noted that drug tests in the past 
have only been able to show if 
marijuana had been used in the 
past month, not necessarily while 
they were at work. Irwin said 
newer and more advanced drug 
tests are being developed 
that can detect if marijuana 
has 
been 
used 
in 
the 
immediate time frame or 
further in the past. 
“So, 
what 
I’ve 
been 
encouraging employers to 
do, is to start looking at some 
of the newer tests that are 
available,” Irwin said. “You 
might have heard of some of 
the roadside swab-tests that 
are going on across the state 
of Michigan. I don’t think 
that these produce data that 
would be reliable in a court of 
law, but I think it would be a 
better tool for our employers 
to use something that would 
give them a better read on 
the recency of use.”
Siecinski 
disagreed, 
saying 
employers 
administering 
drug 
tests 
was proper and reasonable. 
He said as a member of the 
police force, the federal law 
governs what he does in his 
free time, rather than state 
law.
“I would say certainly 
employers should be able 

to limit whether or not their 
employees partake in cannabis,” 
Siecinski said. “One example is 
law enforcement. Despite the fact 
it’s legal in Michigan, it remains 
illegal federally, so police officers, 
for example, by federal law, 
you’re not allowed to possess a 
firearm and be in possession of a 
scheduled drug illegally.” 
All three panelists emphasized 
what they described as the 
extreme need for research on 
the effects of marijuana usage. 
Boehnke said not only is the lack 
of research harming people, but it 
is also what created such a fear of 
the drug in the past decades. 
Irwin agreed, acknowledging 
that 
many 
legislators 
feel 
anxious about approving laws 
regarding its legalization due to a 
misunderstanding about the drug 
and its impacts.
“We certainly couldn’t pass it, 
you know, out of the Michigan 
legislature,” Irwin said. “We 
had to go through the vote of the 
people, because we knew that 
we wouldn’t get the support in 
Lansing because, once again, 
there’s a huge generational divide 
in this issue, and the people who 
tend to be in the legislature tend 
to be a little older and a lot of these 
people built their career on this 
sort of ‘tough on crime’ position.” 
In addition to Michigan’s 6 
percent 
sales 
tax, 
marijuana 
sales are subject to a 10 percent 
excise tax. Irwin pointed out that 
revenue generated from the taxes 
would go to schools and local 
governments and infrastructure.
“However, here’s a part of it 
that I don’t think many people 
have even seen, which is that for 
the first two years of taxation, 
the state of Michigan is going to 
generate $20 million for two years 
for a total of $40 million, which is 
going to go into research,” Irwin 
said.

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, Business senior Sonia 
Lee reported on a student’s use of GoFundMe to pay for his 
outstanding tuition after he was denied in-state tuition due to his 
immigration status.

“Speaking with Juan and Barbara for this story gave me so much more 
insight on what it’s like to be undocumented at Michigan, especially 
with the current climate surrounding immigration policy and DACA. 
At the same time, I was able to learn about how the university 
administration is trying to engage more with this community and work 
with them to find solutions. This was about understanding and telling 
Juan’s story and SCOPE’s activism while balancing how university 
policy revision works.”

Members 
of 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
community 
also 
attended the event. Ann 
Arbor resident and U-M 
Dearborn alum Elizabeth 
Cobb took this event as an 
opportunity to learn more 
about affordable housing 
for a social psychologist 
she is working with and to 
become more involved in 
her Ann Arbor community.
“I 
went 
to 
University 
Michigan-Dearborn, 
and 
when I was an undergrad, 
I worked with a social 
psychology 
professor 

there,” Cobb said. “And she 
does research about income 
inequality in the social class 
and that includes housing 
affordability. I’m also going 
into that field. And so I’m 
here to take notes and learn 
more about what’s going 
on. Also, I just moved to 
Ann Arbor, so I’m mostly 
interested for that reason.”
Over the next four days 
and four workshops, Ann 
Arbor and SmithGroup are 
working to inform residents 
about the new affordable 
housing plan. They also 
want to gather information 
on 
the 
community’s 
preferences on where this 
housing will be located.

HOUSING
From Page 2

“The Trump Administration 
is sadly moving to formally 
withdraw 
from 
the 
Paris 
Climate Agreement and refuses 
to acknowledge the science or 
urgency to act,” Dingell said. 
“Participants at COP25 will lay 
out crucial steps and implement 
guidelines to reduce greenhouse 
gases — it’s critical our nation 
be represented at the coalition. 
American leadership is at the 
center of rising to the moment 
to protect our planet for future 
generations.” 
In a joint press conference 
with Spanish Prime Minister 
Pedro Sánchez, Pelosi stated that 
extreme actions are necessary to 
combat climate change and there 
is significant bicameral support in 
Congress.
“Our delegation is here to 
send a message that Congress’s 
commitment to taking action on 
the climate crisis is ironclad,” 
Pelosi said. “We must act, because 
the climate crisis for us is a matter 
of public health, clean air, clean 
water for children’s survival; our 
economy, advancing green, global 
– green technologies, which will 
lift everyone up as we address 
income disparity in the world,” 
Pelosi said. 
The convention comes at a 
time when the climate crisis has 
been heavily discussed in Ann 
Arbor politics. On Nov. 4, the 
Ann Arbor City Council passed 
a resolution to achieve carbon 
neutrality by the year 2030. 
Additionally, earlier this year, 
demonstrators staged a sit-in 
in the Fleming Administration 
Building demanding a meeting 
with the University of Michigan 
administration to address how 
the University plans on achieving 
carbon neutrality. This has placed 
additional pressures on University 
President Mark Schlissel as he 
balances the University’s carbon 
neutrality plan with continuing to 
fund the University as a research 
institution.
Public 
Policy 
senior 
and 
Ann Arbor native Bernadette 
Fitzsimons 
was 
enthusiastic 
about Dingell’s inclusion in the 
delegation. 
“I believe climate change is 
a priority for Congresswoman 
Dingell,” 
Fitzsimons 
said. 
“I 
think she is one of the hardest 
working members of Congress. 
She is deeply committed to her 
constituents, and I believe she 
understands 
that 
creating 
a 
sustainable future is key to the 
well-being of her constituents.” 
Yet the response to the climate 

crisis hasn’t been moving fast 
enough for some constituents. 
Over the past few months, several 
protesters have occupied Dingell’s 
office to urge her to support the 
Green New Deal.
Zaynab Elkolaly, a student at 
student at Washtenaw Technical 
Middle College and a member of 
the Sunrise Movement, expressed 
disappointment in Dingell’s lack 
of substantial actions regarding 
climate change. 
“It is important, first and 
foremost, on paper that we 
represent the Green New Deal as 
a nation, but it is also important 
to represent it in actions too,” 
Elkolaly said. “Politicians are 
quick to be glad about wanting 
to end climate change and how 
much of an emergency it is,” she 
said. “And then, they’ll proceed to 
take thousands and thousands of 
dollars … from big corporations.”
In an interview with The Daily, 
Dingell’s 
primary 
challenger, 
Solomon 
Rajput, 
argued 
members of Congress tasked 
with representing the United 
States at the United Nations 
Climate 
Convention 
should 
be at the forefront of climate 
change policies. Rajput noted 
this holds particularly true since 
the convention is being held in 
Spain, which is one of the most 
progressive countries in fighting 
climate change.
“Spain is one of the forefront 
countries when it comes to 
tackling climate change. They 
themselves have embraced the 
idea of a Green New Deal, which 
is pretty cool,” Rajput said. 
“Almost all of the progressives 
have signed onto the Green New 
Deal. Congresswoman Dingell 
is one of the last progressives 
to not sign onto it. … We need a 
representative who (is) going to be 
championing a Green New Deal 
if they are going to be out there 
representing us when it comes to 
Climate Change.” 
Fitzsimons said she admires 
Dingell’s care in representing all 
constituents in her district, and 
not those just in Ann Arbor. 
“It 
is 
also 
worth 
noting 
that groups which represent 
autoworkers in her district, like 
the United Auto Workers, have not 
come out in support of the Green 
New Deal. I think encouraging 
labor organizations like the UAW 
to support policies to combat the 
climate crisis is key to creating a 
sustainable future for Michigan,” 
Fitzsimons said. “Of course, the 
climate crisis poses an existential 
threat to all of her constituents. 
But I believe Congresswoman 
Dingell understands this, and 
aims to act in a way that will best 
serve all her constituents in both 
the long and short run.”

DINGELL

“The 
University 
of 
Michigan is the top public 
institution in the country, and 
the fact that it is neglecting 
communities of color, low-

communities around the world 
in its complicity with climate

one 
public 
institution,” Girgis said. 
Before 
the 
last 
public 
commenter 
addressed 
the 
Board of Regents, the 1U and 
CAM 
members 
present 
in 
the meeting exited the room 
chanting, “The people united 
will never be defeated.” 
Wearing 
1U 
pins 
and 
holding signs criticizing the 
University 
for 
continuing 
to invest in fossil fuels, the 
protesters gathered in front 
of all entrances to the golf 
course, creating a blockade so 
cars could not drive through. 
In an interview with The 
Daily at the protest following 
the meeting, Regent Michael 
Behm (D) said he remains 
supportive of the protesters 
even though most regents 
choose not to respond to 
their statements during the 
public comment section of the 
meeting. 
“(The 
meeting 
is) 
not 
conducive 
to 
having 
a 
conversation,” 
Behm 
said. 
“Many of the topics that 
came up are things we’re 
presently working on. And I 
think it’s good that we do have 
comments like this, because 
the comments make the board 
mindful of how the community 
feels.”
In response to the protesters’ 
demand the University reach 
carbon neutrality by 2030, 
Behm said the University’s 
administration 
is 
working 
toward making small changes 
that 
ultimately 
bring 
the 
University closer to this goal. 
“Instead of making a hollow 
promise and not being able 
to live up to it just with an 
arbitrary date, the University 
wants to make sure that we 
can 
truly 
achieve 
carbon 
neutrality,” 
Behm 
said. 
“I 
think (the changes) can be 
incremental.” 
Regent Paul Brown (D) also 
came 
to 
the 
post-meeting 
protest. He addressed the 
current 
culture 
at 
board 
meetings to stay silent after 
the public commenters in an 
interview with The Daily. 
He said he wished he could 
respond, 
and 
that 
there 
needs to be a better line of 
communication 
and 
more 
transparency. 
Brown 
also 
noted the regents do care 
about issues such as climate 
change 
and 
inequitable 
funding 
on 
the 
different 
campuses and spend time 
brainstorming solutions. 
“As a new regent, I’m trying 
to understand the protocol 
and why the current protocol 
exists,” Brown said. “But I, 
and 
probably 
every 
other 
regent, is crawling out of our 
skin wanting to respond to 
each speaker. Right now, the 
culture is to not. I suspect 
there are a lot of good reasons 
for it, but we have to figure out 
a way to answer each of these 
questions, because that’s what 

the questioners deserve. … 
we have to figure out a way 
to communicate what we’re 
doing and why we’re doing it, 
because the questions that the 
speakers brought up, we spent 
most of the day today working 
on. We are focused really on 
the issues they brought up 
today.”
While most of the protesters 
were gathered at the main 
entrance on East Stadium 
Boulevard, some were at a 
back entrance and a walkway 
to 
prevent 
administration 
from exiting. Police officers 
and security began bringing 
out barricades to stop the 
activists from leaving the 
front area, even if they were 
just trying to get to their cars.
The officers said “there was 
no reason to go down there,” 
and 
threatened 
to 
arrest 
anyone who tried to cross the 
barricade for trespassing. 
Eventually, 
the 
police 
and security forcibly moved 
and held back the protesters 
blockading 
the 
back 
exit 
and waved the cars of the 
administrators and regents 
through. 
After the protesters were 
pushed aside by police officers 
and forced to vacate the 
entrances, Girgis and Medintz 
spoke to the remaining crowd 
and 
praised 
their 
efforts, 
saying they were “brave” to 
risk possible arrest for their 
cause. Girgis said even though 
they made progress in forcing 
the board to listen to their 
statements, students will still 
need to put pressure on the 
University to agree to their 
demands. 
“The fact of the matter is 
that, yet again, discussion 
has been avoided about the 
issues that matter most to us,” 
Girgis said, causing a chorus 
of “boos” from the crowd. 
“About the issues that matter 
to the state and the people 
of Michigan, and about the 
issues that matter most to 
the nation and the world as a 
whole. And, to be clear, this 
is not an isolated incident. 
We’ve been doing the work for 
a year and being ignored. And 
that’s why we’re here, and 
that’s why we’re angry.” 
The University of Michigan 
Board of Regents convened 
for their final meeting of 
the year on Thursday at the 
Richard L. Postma Family 
Clubhouse 
to 
discuss 
the 
interim 
replacement 
of 
E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
Vice 
President for Student Life; 
the University’s investments 
in fossil fuels; and rights for 
student athletes. Community 
members and students from 
the One University Campaign 
and Climate Action Movement 
protested before, during and 
after the meeting. 
The board approved Simone 
Taylor, the senior associate 
vice president for Student Life, 
as the interim Vice President 
for Student Life to begin 
serving in that role on Jan. 
18, 2020. Soon after, President 
Mark Schlissel sent an email 
to the University community 
announcing 
Taylor’s 
appointment as interim vice 
president. 
In an address to the Board, 
Regent Katherine White (D) 
officially named Harper a 
Vice President Emerita of 
Student Life and presented a 

plaque to her in honor of her 
commitment to the University. 
Harper thanked her colleagues 
in her last speech to the board. 
“You’ve been such great 
teachers 
and 
healers 
to 
so many faculty, staff and 
students, 
including 
me,” 
Harper said tearfully. “I’ve 
appreciated our opportunity 
to share thoughts, counsel 
and 
loving 
energy. 
We’ve 
been colleagues and friends, 
students and teachers.”
Schlissel also announced 
the new E. Royster Harper 
Scholarship to provide greater 
financial aid to University 
students. 
“On a personal level, I can’t 
imagine a better partner and 
colleague to work alongside 
the rest of the executive team 
and myself in providing an 
outstanding experience for our 
students, great mentorship, 
sage 
advice, 
wonderful 
friendship and collectively we 
all wish her a long, healthy, 
happy and joyous retirement,” 
Schlissel said. 
The Regents proceeded to 
vote down a proposed $50 
million dollar investment to 
Vendera Resources, a company 
known for its extensive assets 
in oil and gas production. 
Before the vote, Regent 
Jordan Acker (D) spoke up 
and motioned to deny the 
investment. Acker had tweeted 
the Regents should not make 
the investment and that doing 
so would not align with the 
University’s values. 
“Vendera is a company that 
almost 
exclusively 
invests 
in Oil and Gas drilling and 
exploration, 
some 
of 
the 
greatest drivers of climate 
change,” Acker wrote. “At the 
very moment that @UMich 
needs to be pushing away from 
dirty energy, this is absolutely 
the wrong path.”
When the board ultimately 
voted to not invest in Vendera 
Resources, the room erupted 
into applause. 
Acker 
then 
brought 
up 
name, 
image 
and 
likeness 
rights in the NCAA, which 
allow 
college 
athletes 
to 
earn money off of things like 
advertisements 
or 
clinics. 
NCAA athletes are currently 
not allowed to do this and face 
potential ineligibility. 
He 
emphasized 
students 
at 
the 
University 
who 
pursue other professions are 
encouraged to be showcased 
and do whatever it takes to 
succeed. 
He 
said 
athletes 
should be awarded the same 
rights. 
“Allowing 
name, 
image 
and 
likeness 
rights 
helps 
our 
athletes,” 
Acker 
said. 
“Throughout this University, 
we are able to push our students 
to succeed in their chosen 
fields. We hold showcases for 
our musical theatre students, 
we encourage the recruitment 
of our students for companies 
throughout the world, and 
even work with our students 
and faculty to allow them 
to use their ideas to start 
world-changing 
businesses. 
Restriction of these rights 
to athletes in this context is 
simply unconscionable.”
After 
Acker’s 
statement, 
public 
commenters 
from 
the 
community 
addressed 
the Regents about divesting 
from fossil fuels, reaching 
carbon neutrality and the 

1U Campaign. Out of 15 total 
public commenters, 13 spoke 
to the Regents about the 
University’s investments in 
fossil fuels and what they say 
is an unequal distribution of 
resources across the three 
University campuses. 
The 
majority 
of 
public 
commenters, 
especially 
those associated with 1U and 
CAM, posed a question to the 
board about the University’s 
perceived 
inaction 
toward 
reaching 
carbon 
neutrality 
or unwillingness to allocate 
more resources to the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses. After 
asking these questions, the 
commenters waited for the 
Regents to respond. 
In 
between 
speakers, 
members of CAM and 1U 
chanted slogans like “empty 
words 
but 
no 
equitable 
funding” and “we deserve to 
be heard.” 
Engineering senior Logan 
Vear, a member of CAM, told 
the Regents there is a strong 
link between issues of climate 
change 
and 
1U’s 
mission 
and asked why the Regents 
have not responded directly 
to 
either 
organizations’ 
demands after a year of 
protesting. 
“While some of you have 
expressed 
sympathy, 
and 
even at times support, you 
have done next to nothing 
to tangibly act to support 
our causes. During public 
comment, you have actively 
ignored us, looked down at 
your phones and have left the 
moment we finish or during 
our 
comments 
as 
well,” 
Vear said. “So, we ask, why 
should we continue to come 
to Regents meetings if they 
have been so fruitless over 
the last year?”
In 
response 
to 
Vear’s 
question, 
Regent 
Shauna 
Ryder Diggs (D) said most of 
the Regents do take the public 
commenters’ arguments into 
account 
and 
sympathize 
with 
their 
views. 
She 
noted how even though the 
organizations’ arguments have 
been 
impactful, 
significant 
institutional change still takes 
a while to enact. 
“Asking us to give you an 
answer right this second, I just 
can’t do that,” Diggs said. “I 
actually think that you’ve been 
very effective, because when 
you first started coming to the 
Regents meetings and talking 
individually with each one of 
us, there was no (President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality). Even doing all of 
that work, I think is the reason 
why President Schlissel put 
together this commission.”
Diggs was the only Regent at 
the meeting to directly respond 
to CAM and 1U’s questions. 
LSA 
senior 
Dim 
Mang 
reacted to Diggs’s comment by 
saying student activists should 
not have to work tirelessly to 
receive basic resources and 
support from the University’s 
administration. 
“You listen to us, but at 
the same time we shouldn’t 
have to fight for our own 
livelihoods day in and day out 
when U-M is lucky to have 
these students here,” Mang 
said. “Our activism isn’t here 
to window dress your inaction 
and, frankly, your fear of 
student power.”

Irwin also discussed how 
Michigan has learned from 
laws 
passed 
in 
Colorado, 
California and Washington, 
D.C. 
Allyson Job, a public health 
graduate student at EMU, 
said 
she 
appreciated 
the 
perspective provided by the 
panelists, but pointed out that 
all of them were white men. 
She said that an additional 
panelist would have helped 
broaden the range of opinions 
shared at the event.
“I wish it would have been 
more representative of the 
community rather than three 
Caucasian men. I would like 
to see a little more diversity,” 
Job said. “But I did like it, 
and they answered a lot of 
questions, and overall, I liked 
how it was done, and for the 
first time it was pretty cool.”

During 
the 
panel 
discussion, 
Irwin 
noted 
that communities of color 
and 
lower 
socioeconomic 
standing are being left out 
of the new industry being 
created 
by 
this 
recent 
legalization. 
“And, you know, given that 
fact, I think it’s important 
that communities are careful 
about equity,” Irwin said. 
“We’re going to do these 
things to make sure that we 
have more equity.”
Irwin 
also 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
local 
communities determining for 
themselves whether or not to 
allow sales of marijuana in 
their cities.
“Make sure that it serves 
your community’s needs and 
make sure that you develop 
it in a way that assuages 
the concerns of people in 
your community that are 
concerned and make sure you 
pay attention,” Irwin said.

“You always want to know 
where something is coming 
from that you’re putting in 
your body, and you want to be 
able to go to a place that’s safe 
to get it,” Ransom said. “More 
than anything, we look at it as 
an opportunity to provide safe, 
tested product where they can 
come, get what they need, know 
that it’s from a really good place 
and how they choose to use 
it and where is kind of at the 
discretion of the consumer.”
Green 
Peak 
Innovations 
prides themselves on what they 
call the “from seed to store” 
process, which tightly controls 
the production of marijuana 
from growth to sale to ensure it 
remains high quality. 
Ransom said the legalization 
of recreational marijuana is 
important 
because 
it 
gives 
people what they have wanted 
for a long time, and people 

should have the choice to put 
what they want into their body.
“I see no difference between 
recreational 
marijuana 
and 
getting altered in some other 
way — whether you choose 
to drink or something. If you 
want to work out, I could go 
swimming, I could go running 
— I have choices,” Ransom said. 
“If you want to get a little bit 
altered, choices are nice if you 
want to drink alcohol or smoke 
a little bit. The people have said 
that they want it for some time, 
I think that’s the biggest thing 
so now we’re finally giving them 
what they want.”
Though 
the 
store 
has 
opened up sale of recreational 
marijuana, Ransom said their 
first priority is maintaining the 
supply of product for medical 
customers.
“I would have to imagine 
that some of the patients are 
considered about rec coming 
on and supply,” Ransom said. 
“Although we are excited for 
recreational use coming on, 

we’ll never walk away from 
providing for patients. We want 
to make sure that the medicine 
is available first and foremost.”
The store sells 18 strains 
of cannabis flower, and offers 
a “buy one-get one” deal on 
all 
Skymint 
vapes, 
edibles 
and concentrates. It features 
a variety of CBD products, 
flowers, 
prerolls, 
edibles, 
concentrates, vapes, pipes and 
other accessories. Ransom said 
the store is unique compared to 
other dispensaries in that it is 
set up in a typical retail fashion, 
as well as with the option to 
use their “express lane” when 
purchasing online.
“It’s 
unlike 
a 
lot 
of 
dispensaries. I mean, before I 
think it was so much of a quick 
consult, you come in, you grab 
it, you go, and now I think it’s 
more like typical retail. … For 
us to provide two different 
shopping experiences based on 
what people want, I think that’s 
important,” Ransom said. 
Kinesiology senior Laurence 

Horowitz, president of Green 
Wolverine — an organization for 
students interested in business 
and dedicated to educating 
people about cannabis and the 
marijuana industry — discussed 
the short-term effects this new 
market will have on the Ann 
Arbor area.
“In (the) short-term, people 
will definitely go to this new 
dispensary to try their product. 
However, only time will tell 
if the new establishment will 
develop a foothold in the Ann 
Arbor market,” Horowitz said. 
“Use will most likely go up as 
it will be a novelty. However, 
things will die down, and the 
recreational 
customers 
that 
are using today will now be 
receiving their product after it 
has been extensively regulated 
so 
that 
it 
doesn’t 
include 
chemicals 
and 
pesticides 
instead of from a street dealer.”

Well-faring farewell

Two truths and a lie: Cheney, Iraq and viral memes

O

n a Monday morning in 
September 1796, readers 
of 
the 
Philadelphia 
newspaper the Daily Advertiser 
learned that George Washington, 
after having served as president 
for eight years, would not seek 
re-election for a third term. The 
news that Washington, former 
commander of the Continental 
Army, president of the Constitutional 
Convention and first President of the 
United States – in short, an American 
demigod – would be stepping down 
probably overshadowed the content 
of his farewell address. The letter, 
first published by the Advertiser 
and soon reprinted by newspapers 
nationwide, also contained words 
of counsel for the fledgling republic. 
One noteworthy piece of advice 
Washington offered concerned the 
recent rise of a party system, which 
pitted Hamilton’s Federalists against 
Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans. 
Washington warned that a party 
system could threaten popular 
democracy, but he acknowledged 
that the advent of an adversarial 
system of partisanship structure 
was perhaps inevitable. “This spirit, 
unfortunately, is inseparable from 
our nature,” Washington wrote, 
and it manifests itself “under 
different shapes in all governments.” 
Despite his visions for non-partisan 
government, Washington worried – 
and correctly so – that factionalism 
would take root in the District of 
Columbia.
The party system framework 
established by the Federalists and 
Democratic-Republicans still exists 
today. While the names have changed 
and third parties have occasionally 
experienced swells in popularity, 
the two-party system has dominated 
the American government for over 
two 
centuries. 
That 
American 
democracy has survived this whole 
time with a two-party system would 
seem to indicate that Washington’s 
concerns were ill-founded — but it 
also doesn’t mean that his cautions 
against partisanship were without 
usable wisdom.
In fact, Washington’s advice 
reflects present public sentiments 
about our current system. A March 
NBC/WSJ poll found that 38 percent 
of Americans “think the two-party 
system is seriously broken,” the 
highest public share since NBC/
WSJ first posed the question in 1995. 
Only one in 10, feel that “the two-
party system works fairly well.”
The two-party system is so 
deeply entrenched in our political 
landscape that it’s safe to say 
Washington’s non-partisan visions 
will never be achieved. That said, 

the two-party system, while it is the 
U.S.’s traditional model, is perhaps 
not suited for our hyper-polarized 
times. 
Though 
a 
multi-party 
system is a feature of many modern 
democracies, it has only a few 
historical precedents in the United 
States. On occasion, third parties 
have enjoyed fleeting popularity 
– sometimes even displacing a 
pre-existing party – but prevailing 
currents have traditionally borne 
American politics back to a two-
party equilibrium. But such an 
electoral arrangement is not entirely 
alien to American political thought; 
it was actually promoted by James 
Madison, our fourth president and 
the chief author of the Constitution.

To counter the consolidation of 
power in the hands of a few, Madison 
advocated in Federalist Paper No. 
10 the development of multiple 
“factions,” or parties, to represent the 
interests of a diverse populace. Like 
Washington, Madison recognized 
that 
non-partisan 
government 
was a pipe dream, as splintering 
into political groups is “sown in 
the nature of man.” Accepting 
this reality, the most realistic way 
to address Americans’ political 
interests would be to have a range of 
factions catering to them — thereby 
also diffusing power between a 
greater range of the population.
Like 
Washington, 
Madison’s 
visions did not come to national 
fruition. 
Madison 
feared 
the 
consolidation of power in the hands 
of a single party, which our two-party 
system has been largely successful 
in avoiding. That said, increasing 
numbers of Americans feel their 
voices aren’t represented through 
the two options that dominate our 
political scene.
The Democratic and Republican 
parties — presently at their most 
polarized in living memory — 
just aren’t cutting it. Two weeks 
before the 2016 election, 61 percent 
of Americans said neither party 
represented their beliefs. A natural 
remedy for this, of course, is the 
introduction of additional parties 

to the U.S.’s political stage. And 
a majority would be in favor: 
According to a 2018 Gallup poll, 57 
percent of Americans reflected a 
desire “for a third, major political 
party.”
Our election system can be 
described 
as 
winner-takes-all: 
The congressional candidate who 
receives the most votes wins their 
district, and the presidential hopeful 
who receives the most votes gains 
all of a state’s electoral votes. The 
emergence of a major third party 
under such an arrangement is 
unlikely, because a vote for a third-
party candidate is often perceived as 
a “wasted vote.” As such, a majority 
of voters hold their noses and go with 
the party that more closely reflects 
their interests, but leave the ballot 
box unsatisfied.
Encouraging 
the 
emergence 
of third parties, and in doing so 
providing the public with more 
viable political options to represent 
it, necessitates a reconfiguration 
of 
our 
election 
system. 
A 
proportional system — wherein 
splits in the electorate’s voting 
are proportionately reflected in 
government — would allow far 
greater freedom in one’s choice of 
party without the current risk of 
“throwing away” one’s vote.
Say you’re a Republican, but you 
worry that the party is becoming 
too conservative, and you’re sick 
of inane partisan bickering. Under 
a proportional system, you could 
vote for the moderate party that 
would inevitably emerge (parties 
of all stripes exist in countries with 
such an electoral system). If the 35 
percent of Americans who identify 
as moderates were to vote with you, 
the “Centrist Party” would receive 
35 percent of seats – perhaps enough 
to constitute a plurality.
The Founding Fathers were wise 
men who devised an electoral system 
that has functioned, even thrived, 
for over two centuries. They were 
also not infallible. By design, they 
left their American progeny with a 
malleable Constitution to be altered 
in accordance with changing needs. 
The Democratic and Republican 
parties are becoming increasingly 
polarized, and on their divergent 
trajectories leave more and more 
ideological real estate between 
them. It does not take a political 
oracle to recognize that this trend is 
unsustainable. If we are to improve 
American democracy, we must be 
receptive to propositions that will 
ensure its preservation.

efore the exciting new 
world of TikTok, before 
we could enjoy its “For 
You” page’s random, entertaining 
15-second videos and long before 
the proliferation of VSCO girl 
jokes, there was Vine. Most young 
people in the United States keeping 
an eye on the internet are already 
well aware of one of Vine’s most 
iconic memes, “Dick Cheney made 
money off the Iraq War.” The 
brief, seemingly tongue-in-cheek 
video of the original Vine of a guy 
repeating this sentiment into the 
camera has received hundreds of 
thousands of views and seems like 
a snapshot of millennial humor, but 
the history of private war-making 
in U.S. politics is long and brutal. 
Private 
military 
contractors 
— 
essentially, 
multinational 
corporations that hire professional 
mercenaries to participate and aid 
in wars abroad — are an ideal tool 
to ensure the human and emotional 
costs of war remain largely hidden 
from the American public. In her 
book “The Lonely Soldier”, author 
Helen Benedict details the overlap 
between 
private 
corporations 
who engaged in war-fighting and 
the government officials who 
supported the conflict in Iraq. As 
the book and other sources detail, 
the corporations involved in the 
Iraq War included those such as 
Blackwater Worldwide. But the 
largest corporation by far was KBR, 
a subsidiary of the Halliburton 
corporation, of which Dick Cheney 
had been the CEO before entering 
the White House. In the first 
year of the Iraq War alone, then-
President Bush and Vice President 
Cheney handed over $39.5 billion 
over 10 years in noncompetitive 
contracts to KBR to provide 
anything from food and water to 
vehicles and weapons for soldiers 
in Iraq. Suspicions of Cheney’s 
war profiteering seem even more 

credible given The Guardian’s 
report that Cheney was paid an 
extra $1 million by Halliburton 
during the time he served as vice 
president. The Washington Post 
has also reported extensively on the 
large bonuses that KBR received 
during the time of the conflict. 
One would assume that the 
massive amount of money pouring 
into private military contractors 
during the Iraq War would have 
translated into the efficiency and 
the desired results often associated 
with the private sector. But the 
use of private defense contractors 
has yielded mixed results abroad, 
and this is particularly true 
in Iraq. Indeed, an archived 
2011 report from a bipartisan 
government commission tasked 
with investigating potential abuse 
of funds in the Iraq War estimated 
that there was a $60 billion total — 
or $12 million/day — loss or waste in 
fraud via funds allocated from the 
government to private contractors 
since 2001. 
Though Cheney’s involvement in 
the conflict seems troubling as well 
as financially motivated, it would be 
inaccurate to suggest that corporate 
greed was the sole contributor 
to the U.S.’s involvement in Iraq. 
This is not necessarily a uniquely 
American phenomenon — the U.K., 
for example, also has a booming 
industry for private war-fighting. 
What 
is 
uniquely 
American, 
though, is the breadth of other 
justifications for U.S. involvement 
and deployment, which is not more 
reassuring than the assertion that 
Cheney’s greed facilitated the 
conflict itself. President George W. 
Bush’s claim that Iraq possessed 
chemical and/or biological weapons 
of mass destruction revealed itself 
to be a lie. Many in policy circles 
also believed that the U.S. would 
be welcomed as a benevolent 
global power that could restore the 

American-led deterrence in the 
Middle East (a blatant falsehood, 
as U.S. forces entering the region 
quickly realized). But one of the 
darker reasons later suggested for 
the war is that the United States 
needed the conflict — that the post-
9/11 power vacuum necessitated 
an 
international 
leader 
to 
demonstrate it could fill the 
void of liberalism, that the U.S.’s 
invasion of Iraq would “reassert 
and demonstrate (U.S.) strength 
in no uncertain terms to a global 
audience, crown itself king of the 
hill, and reestablish generalized 
deterrence.” 
It’ll be years before we can see 
what the Bush administration’s 
motivations might have been, after 
White House documents become 
declassified or leaked. But we 
can see fragments of this policy 
at work today in Donald Trump’s 
presidency, despite the White 
House’s 
repeated 
isolationist 
stances 
toward 
international 
engagement. 
Daniel 
DePetris, 
a 
fellow 
at 
security-focused 
think tank Defense Priorities, 
has written about how Trump 
has 
repeatedly 
characterized 
military engagement in the Middle 
East as hopeless: The president 
argued that “Iraq was a disaster; 
Afghanistan was a tragic waste of 
lives of resources; Syria was a land 
of ‘sand and death’; and the nation-
building campaigns in the Middle 
East were a sad joke.” And yet, for 
all of Trump’s insistence on the 
futility of spending resources in 
the Middle East, his rhetoric has 
not aligned with reality. Recent 
increases in U.S. military spending 
seem to indicate that the drive for 
American militarism has certainly 
remained intact and has every 
intention to accelerate.

In the last six months, New 
York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 
followed through with a plan 
to plant 500 police officers in 
the subway and bus systems 
of New York City to combat 
a rise in fare evasion and 
worker attacks. The policy 
will fine fare evaders $100 
 
— but with increased police 
presence in public spaces, 
heightened 
surveillance 
from new security cameras 
and $249 million spent to 
make these changes, New 
Yorkers across the boroughs 
are protesting these changes 
that will disproportionately 
impact 
poor 
communities 
and people of color. This 
crackdown on fare evasion 
criminalizes 
these 
groups 
instead of succeeding with 
any 
greater 
MTA 
claim, 
costing the city more than 
just the millions spent to 
“better” it. 
State Sen. Jessica Ramos, 
D-N.Y., put it best: “Say we 
had $249M and we could 
do anything we wanted to 
improve the subway system, 
what 
would 
you 
want 
to 
see 
prioritized?” 
The 
MTA lacks funding for its 
programs 
and 
desperately 
needs 
infrastructure 
fixes 
that could benefit all New 
Yorkers. Tracks and stations 
themselves 
are 
defunct 
with constant delays and 
maintenance issues, causing 
a steady ridership decline. 
What residents really want 
is to be able to get to where 
they’re going quickly and 
safely — something that could 
be fixed with a dedication 
to upgrades and efficient 
construction plans. 
From the perspective of 
the everyday commuter, fare-
beater crackdowns seem like 
a misinformed judgment call 
by authority figures detached 
from the subway itself. The 
problems most riders have 
with public transit are the 
inconsistent train times and 
crumbling 
infrastructure. 
Danny Pearlstein, the policy 
and communications director 
for 
the 
nonprofit 
Riders 
Alliance, when speaking with 
AM New York said, “The fare 
evasion conversation overall 
is a red herring. When the 

governor talks about fare 
evasion, he’s throwing the 
subway’s problems back on 
riders.” 
Further, the recent MTA 
fare crackdown follows a 
pattern of harmful policing 
policies, 
such 
as 
“stop-
and-frisk” 
policing, 
which 
disproportionately 
targets 
Black 
and 
Latinx 
youth. 
Just 
like 
“stop-and-frisk”, 
the crackdown is already 
impacting people of color, 
with 84 percent of Brooklyn 
fare evasion arrests being 
Black and Latinx.

Even though nearly 40 
percent 
of 
subway 
riders 
evade fares at least once 
a 
year, 
African-American 
and 
Latinx 
communities, 
especially those that are low 
income, have the greatest 
likelihood of arrest for fare 
evasion. The MTA crackdown 
is 
representative 
of 
the 
larger burden of policing 
that low-income and POC 
communities face all across 
the country. Just as other 
policing policies and tactics, 
the discretionary nature of 
police power leads to the 
unjust and racist targeting of 
communities of color. 
To be clear, the policing 
and criminalization of fare 
evasion 
is 
costly 
— 
and 
not just financially. Over-
policing and policies such 
as 
“stop-and-frisk” 
erode 
trust 
between 
the 
police 
and the communities they 
are supposed to be serving. 
The MTA claims these new 
anti-fare 
beater 
policies 
will increase rider safety, 
but crime in the subways 
is actually down to around 
one crime per million riders 
— an estimated 86 percent 

drop 
from 
1990. 
Despite 
arguments that criminalizing 
fare evasion makes transit 
safer, the reality is that 
criminalizing petty offenses 
destroys communities’ faith 
in the police to keep their 
communities safe. 
So far, the introduction 
of 500 police officers into 
the subway system has been 
a cause for concern. In a 
city already grappling with 
cases 
of 
police 
brutality 
and 
unreasonable 
arrests, 
the criminalization of fare 
evasion is furthering tensions 
between all parties. After 
videos showed young Black 
teenagers 
being 
tackled, 
tased and beaten over the 
$2.75 
fare, 
riders 
have 
started a “Swipe it Forward” 
campaign, and movements 
like “Decolonize this Place” 
have organized mass fare 
evasions similar to those in 
Santiago, Chile. Fare evasion 
is not a violent crime and 
criminalizing it only stands 
to undermine any attempts 
of 
understanding 
and 
communication between the 
police and citizens — two vital 
components to maintaining a 
safe environment. 
It is time that we as a society 
learn from our past policy 
failures. The MTA crackdown 
is only one of a long-standing 
pattern 
of 
discriminatory 
police practices that have 
consequences 
for 
people’s 
individual 
and 
collective 
societal futures. 
The 
Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial Board stands with 
protesters and believes the 
New York City government 
should 
stop 
using 
tactics 
that do nothing to resolve 
the issues within the subway 
system and, instead, only 
further harass communities 
of color. The money being 
funneled 
into 
increasing 
police presence in subways 
and installing cameras to 
catch fare evasion should be 
put toward the plethora of 
other issues the MTA faces 
rather than being used to 
intimidate 
marginalized 
people. With the thoughts of 
guerrilla MTA signs in mind, 
we implore you, in more ways 
than one: Don’t snitch. Swipe.

Noah Baumbach is no stranger to divorce. His 
2005 film “The Squid and the Whale” chronicles 
the experiences of a Brooklyn family adjusting to 
the separation of two parents; it is hilarious and 
heartfelt, and I love it. However, there is admittedly 
something “off,” 
something 
unreal about the 
family it depicts. 
The 
way 
its 
characters speak 
and 
interact 
with 
each 
other is close to 
reality, but just 
slightly 
askew 
from it. Across 
his body of work, 
Baumbach 
still 
manages to get to a real, profound emotional core in 
spite of the unbelievability of his characters, much 
like Wes Anderson does in his films. 
There’s something different about “Marriage 
Story,” Baumbach’s latest film. It’s not necessarily 
better, just different. For lack of a better word, the 
divorce that ensues in “Marriage Story” is infinitely 
“realer” than the divorce in 
“The Squid and the Whale.” 
Unlike the latter, “Marriage 
Story” is fiercely committed 
to realism, and its two leads, 
Adam Driver (“Paterson”) and 
Scarlett Johansson (“Under 
the Skin”) lose themselves 
inside of the alternate reality 
Baumbach creates, and I can’t 
think of any two actors or any 
director I’d rather get lost 
with. 
As Driver aptly put it in a 
recent interview with Stephen 
Colbert, “Marriage Story” is a 
love story, but one that is told 
through the lens of a divorce. 
Driver 
and 
Johansson’s 
characters, Charlie and Nicole, 
are a married couple and 
parents to their son Henry 
(Azhy 
Robertson, 
“Juliet, 
Naked”). Apart from their 
son, they are highly involved 
in New York’s theater scene: 
Charlie directs, Nicole acts. 
For a plethora of reasons too 
complicated 
to 
adequately 
address here, Nicole decides to 
divorce Charlie and move her 
and her son to Los Angeles, 
where she grew up. What 
happens next is unpleasant to 
say the least. 
Divorce 
tends 
to 
bring 
out the worst in people, and 
“Marriage 
Story” 
is 
well 
aware of that. Charlie and 
Nicole throw words at each 
other 
like 
daggers. 
Their 
passive aggression builds and 
builds until the point when it can’t anymore, and 
what results will take your breath away. The sheer 
intensity of their shouting match rivals any battle 
scene you’ll ever see. Charlie and Nicole, caught 
up in their anger, transform into something that is 
terrifying to witness. Watching Driver scream at 
Johansson, it is beyond clear that he is no longer 

himself. He’s not even his character anymore. He 
is rage. His is the kind of performance people will 
flock to “Marriage Story” to bear witness to. He 
will be nominated for an Oscar, and he deserves to 
win it. 
Even though Charlie and Nicole sink to the 
depths of depravity when they finally lose control 
over their anger at one another, they are still, in 
spite of everything, good people. After all, one of 
the 
very 
first 
things Charlie’s 
divorce 
lawyer 
(Ray 
Liotta, 
“Goodfellas”) 
tells him is that 
divorce lawyers 
see 
the 
very 
worst parts of 
good 
people. 
We know they 
are good people 
because they are 
both, all in all, 
great parents who are devoted to their son. We also 
believe in their goodness because we know how 
much they once loved each other, and probably even 
still love each other. We know how much love they 
are capable of. 
The film begins and ends with the reasons why 
Charlie and Nicole love each other, written down 
by both of them as an assignment 
from their separation counselor. 
Baumbach doesn’t want us to 
forget them, even when Charlie 
tells Nicole he wishes she were 
dead. In a particularly poignant 
moment, 
Charlie 
reads 
out 
Nicole’s reasons for loving him. 
She writes, “I fell in love with him 
two seconds after I saw him.” A 
tear slides down Charlie’s cheek. 
There’s that famous statistic 
that 
says 
that 
half 
of 
all 
marriages end in divorce. In 
all likelihood that statistic is 
outdated, and it wouldn’t be 
surprising if the success rate 
of marriages has gotten even 
smaller since. Divorce is no 
longer the exception, it is the 
rule. So why do we even bother?
Baumbach 
seems 
to 
have 
his own reasons why. In an 
interview with The Guardian, 
Baumbach describes marriage 
as “a great act of hope.” But how 
can that be possible, how can we 
be hopeful when the chances 
of a successful marriage are so 
small? Maybe Baumbach wants 
us to reconsider what it means 
for a marriage to be “successful.” 
Maybe the goal of marriage 
shouldn’t be longevity. Maybe it 
should be happiness, for as long 
as that is possible. Maybe the 
expectation of lifelong happiness 
only serves to sour the present 
moment. 
I’ve 
been 
thinking 
a 
lot 
about why this movie is called 
“Marriage Story,” not “Divorce 
Story.” We hardly get any glimpse into Charlie and 
Nicole’s life together pre-divorce. But perhaps that 
is the point. Perhaps divorce in the 21st century 
is just as much a part of a marriage as the actual 
marriage itself. Perhaps separation is inevitable, 
or if not inevitable, likely. Maybe that’s okay — 
“Marriage Story” seems to think so.

‘Marriage Story’ is different
for Baumbach, but it’s lovely

I watched “The Talented Mr. Ripley” recently, 
and it was absolutely heartbreaking. Despite the 
titular character, played by Matt Damon, Tom’s 
propensity towards violence and the seemingly 
never-ending string of lies that he finds himself 
needling over the duration of the film, the core of 
his character is one riddled with a sense of deep 
longing and loneliness. He spends the entire 
story trying to lie his way into a life that’s always 
just out of reach.
The father of a dilettante run off to Italy, Dickie 
(played by Jude Law), hires Tom (after being led 
to believe that he went to school with his son) to 
find said dilettante and bring him back to New 
York to rejoin his family’s shipping empire. Of 
course, things do not go according to plan. Tom 
and Dickie become fast friends, and the former 
develops an obsessive infatuation with the latter. 
The rest of the plot is complicated and, hey, that’s 
what Google’s for, right? The four people reading 
this article don’t need a synopsis from the likes of 
me. What matters is that the film fits in squarely 
with a storied history of queer narratives 
dominated by a sense of confused desire, at the 
very least fraught, operating in a landscape of 
imbalanced power, and often unrequited.
These types of films are almost like a right 
of passage for presumably straight male 
heartthrobs: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, 
Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal (2 for 1 
special), Ashton Sanders and now Timothee 
Chalamet, to name a few, have all joined the Gay 
for Pay Hall of Fame, and it’s not a stretch to say 
that all of them have enjoyed a boost in their 
profile for having done so. Depending on who 
you ask, this isn’t necessarily a phenomenon 
worthy of unequivocal condemnation, and 
my critique isn’t directed towards any one of 
these actors of even of the movies themselves, 
but moreso towards an inquiry into the 
dynamics that create a draw towards these 
types of narratives and the guaranteed celebre 
reserved for straight actors who choose to take 

on gay roles.
According to a report by Lyst, Timothee 
Chalamet is the most influential man in fashion 
in 2019. The Vogue article announcing it features 
Timmy boy in a sequined hoodie from Louis 
Vuitton by Virgil Abloh, which was apparently 
commissioned via text. He looks on to the 
cameras covering the red carpet premiere of The 
King that he graces with a deadpan expression, 
fully aware of the power he wields.
It’s impossible to imagine this Chalamet-
steeped reality that we live in without his 
Elio, which quickly earned him an Oscar 
nomination and a continued award show/
premiere partnership with both Louis Vuitton 
and Haider Ackerman, the combination of 
which has afforded him the kind of internet style 
icon status that he will be able to cash in on for 
years to come. This might not have worked in 
the way that it did had he been openly, “visibly” 
gay or even speculated to have been in a same-
sex relationship at the onset of his career. The 
possibility that an actor might experience same 
sex attraction, the interest that yields, along 
with the seemingly enchanting nature of a 
semi-masculine, young, boyish actor being able 
to reasonably act out a same sex relationship on 
screen without showing any evidence that such 
an impulse may have been drawn from real life 
seems to be nothing short of catnip for the media 
circuit.
It’s almost as though the concept of 
homosexuality, particularly male homosexuaity, 
is more attractive to the masses than actually 
being homosexual. The profitability, or at least 
the sheer ability for those expressing genuine 
homosexual desire to find success in the 
entertainment industry, is certainly changing, 
but recent years have provided more than 
enough evidence to suggest that the curiosity 
of what might be is more interesting, more 
consumable, than the real thing. It’s almost like 
we could be supporting queer art that really 
says something and supports the communities 
whose stories they seek to tell, but we’re all 
collectively opting to see a big budget version of 
Czech Hunter instead.

Few works have struck me as much 
after my first viewing as did “Slave Play,” 
Jeremy O. Harris’s radical, complex, 
controversial work at the Golden Theatre 
on Broadway. As I left the theater this 
past weekend and began my five-hour 
journey back to Ann Arbor, I struggled to 
understand what I’d just witnessed.
By the time I’d boarded my flight from 
JFK, I knew that I wanted to address this 
work in my next column. But what could 
I possibly say in a column intended for 
readers that have not necessarily seen the 
work, I asked myself. What could I say 
that this play had not already said?
One aspect of the play that I realized 
had so intrigued and confused me was the 
naked simplicity of much of the dialogue, 
with much of the actions taking place on 
stage and the emotions that propelled 
characters to take those actions.
As 
I’ve 
mentioned 
before, 
I 
am 
currently in the process of co-writing a 
musical. My co-writer and I frequently 
discuss the concept of “show, don’t 
tell,” something that we’ve been told is 
essential to realistic theatrical writing. 
It’s something that we consider in 
our dialogue, our lyrics and our stage 
directions. In “Slave Play,” however, the 
opposite was true. Not only did Harris 
take no steps to make the dialogue subtle; 
in many instances, I would argue, he took 
great pains to ensure that the dialogue 
and plot were entirely unrealistic. This 
technique was so unexpected that it took 
me a little while before I could fully wrap 
my mind around it.
The first section of the play, for 
example, 
follows 
three 
interracial 
couples as they engage in various sex 
acts. The three Black characters embody 
horrific antebellum stereotypes — a 
female domestic slave, a male domestic 
slave and a sharecropping overseer — far 
past the point at which many audience 
members felt uncomfortable. I found 
myself incredibly put off by this first 
section; at points, I almost contemplated 
disengaging completely from the work, 
either by leaving the theater or by 
ceasing to pay any attention. The racist 
underpinnings of these characters were 
absolutely 
revolting, 
and 
I 
couldn’t 
understand why Harris hadn’t twisted 
them in some way.
Theater 
audiences, 
particularly 
Broadway audiences, are conditionally 
trained to search for subtlety, for witty 
conceits and covert nods to larger 
sociopolitical 
themes. 
But 
Harris 
had spent the first hour of the play 
mocking this. He’d staged three simple, 
dismayingly stereotypical interracial sex 
scenes in front of a large mirror; the joke, 
the mirror seemed to say, is not the action 
on stage but the audience’s reactions 
being reflected back at them.

The transition to the next section, 
however, put everything in perspective. 
Two doors at the top of the set opened to 
reveal two therapists/research scientists 
— the horrific, racist-infused sex acts were 
revealed to be part of the “antebellum 
sex therapy” that the three inter-racial 
couples had enrolled in. Harris’s nearly 
hour-long first section was so overtly 
racist, so nakedly offensive, that it had 
begun to lose almost all meaning. These 
stereotypes were being unapologetically 
thrust upon the audience; the results were 
incredibly upsetting. As the characters 
on stage left their therapeutic fantasies 
and reentered the literal world, however, 
the audience’s explicit knowledge of the 
racial underpinnings of these characters’s 
relationships hovered over the scene.
It was almost impossible not to view 
everything that occurred after this point 
through the prism of race. And for the 
next significant portion of the play, as 
the characters struggled to articulate 
their true feelings in their group therapy 
session, the audience analyzed every 
word for its racial submeaning.
As the group therapy session evolved, 
and as the Black characters came to their 
own frightening understandings of the 
unequal interracial relationships they 
shared with their partners, the subtlety of 
the dialogue turned once again. The racial 
overtones that the audience had sought 
so diligently to pull out of the frequently 
humorous dialogue of this second section 
were painfully overt once again. I found 
that I almost had analytic whiplash at 
this point — I’d spent so much energy 
trying to understand the implications 
of the past half hour of dialogue that 
I was completely overwhelmed by the 
obviousness of this new dialogue.
I read recently that an audience 
member 
got 
in 
an 
argument 
with 
Harris during a talk-back after the 
play regarding its treatment of white 
people, specifically white women. Harris 
responded by thanking the woman for 
her great “performance,” describing it as 
“Slave Play, Part 2.”
And while his statements were no 
doubt intended as a joke, it’s hard not to 
take them seriously. The woman’s angry, 
profane rants about the marginalization 
of her and other white woman would 
normally have been humorous — after 
this incredibly conspicuous play, her 
statements seem fitting. It was another 
instance of overt controversy in a work 
mired in overt, explicit statements about 
race and sexuality.
Harris’s explicit methodology, I began 
to realize, is part of his message. In a 
country in which we frequently tiptoe 
around conversations about race, Harris 
reminds us of how explicit and racist 
the forces behind our conversations can 
be. Life is much more obvious, he seems 
to tell us, than the dialogue that we 
frequently see on stage. When it comes to 
race, he suggests we must tell, not show.

FILM REVIEW

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

What makes a good documentary? And why watch a 
documentary in the first place? By my own measure, if I 
can come out of watching one feeling a mixture of touched 
and hopeful, yet hopelessly enraged, I’d consider it pretty 
successful. Lynn Novick’s PBS documentary series 
“College Behind Bars” (produced by the legendary Ken 
Burns) is one of the few I’ve seen that accomplishes all of 
them. 
Through four one-hour episodes, Novick gives viewers 
a look into the Bard Prison Initiative, a program run 
by Bard College in a few prisons in New York state that 
allows a select few inmates those institutions to pursue 
associates and/or Bachelors degrees, identical to those 
given to students at Bard’s main campus in Annandale-
on-Hudson, New York. Through interviews with several 
of the students enrolled in the BPI program as well as its 
administrators and other officials, Novick fully captures 
the sanctuary that the program provides amid the chaos 
of the prison yards, as well as the efforts made to disrupt 
and prevent the spread of those sanctuaries. 
Much has been written, unfortunately, for decades 
now, about the disgraces of our civil justice system (i.e. 
Michelle Alexander’s excellent “The New Jim Crow”), 
a conversation that is intimately tied into the failings 
of the American prison system. While not necessarily 
unique on a global scale, yet repulsively backwards for a 
“developed” country, the cruelly punitive streak of our 
country’s prison system is a point reiterated by many of 
the interviewed students. They emphasize how while the 
idea of incarceration involves an obvious denial of liberty, 
the prisons they live in add insult to injury in a variety of 
dehumanizing ways, one of which is the constant artificial 
disruptions such as mandatory headcounts that make 
pursuing any form of education that much more difficult. 
 
 
 
Novick also makes the audience look inward, and truly 
examine where this punitive streak derives from. One 
of the more surprising revelations is that programs such 
as Bard are nearly entirely privately funded. Why not 

publicly? She shows evidence of a (quite bipartisan, mind 
you) concerted effort by politicians to whip up public 
resentment against those “evil felons” and deny them any 
sort of benefit while they are incarcerated. Who cares if 
that money is being spent instead to lock more people up 
in the first place (perhaps to do hard labor) and harass 
minorities? It’s not hard to blame the students when they 
rightly ridicule the idea that the time they serve is meant 
for “rehabilitation.” 
Another common thread that runs through all 
the interviews with the students, professors and 
administrators of the BPI program is just how beneficial it 
is to every single person involved. I’d be surprised if even 
the most ardent supporter of extra-punitive punishment 
would not waver a bit on their views after watching 
“College Behind Bars,” and the best outcome of the series 
would be more public support for programs like BPI that 
let the multitudes of incarcerated people in the country 
gain an opportunity for a better life.

The holidays aren’t always twinkle lights and chestnuts roasting over 
open fires. For some, it’s a hard reminder of things lost. For others, it’s a 
difficult warning of what’s still around. Some of us are lucky enough to 
call someplace “home” when the snow falls and the bells come jingling. 
But even for the lucky ones, being home can be stressful.
Boyfriend 
Matt 
(Brent Morin, “How 
to Be Single”) and 
girlfriend 
Emmy 
Quinn 
(Bridgit 
Mendler, “Good Luck 
Charlie”) travel from 
L.A. to Emmy’s native 
Philadelphia to spend 
the holidays with her 
family. There, Matt 
intends to make a 
good impression on 
the rest of the Quinns, 
but his plans get 
snuffed out early by 
Emmy’s patriarchal 
father Don (Dennis 
Quaid, “A Dog’s Journey”), a sheriff whose jurisdiction covers not just 
Philadelphia, but his entire family, too. Don’s a traditionalist, to say the 
least. He lives by a set of rules that he ensures his family follows to a tee. 

No drinking, Mass on Sundays and Christmas lights up for no more than 
10 days “because it isn’t Las Vegas.” Naturally, there are complications 
this Christmas. Emmy’s sister Kayla (Ashley Tisdale, “The Suite Life 
of Zack and Cody”) is getting a divorce. Her other sister Patsy (Siobhan 
Murphy, “Schitts Creek”) is having 
trouble conceiving. Her brother Sean 
(Hayes MacArthur, “Super Troopers 
2”) lost his job, and Don refuses to 
give Matt a chance. Just another 
Christmas as far as most 
of us are concerned.
If the plot sounds 
like it could border on 
the generic — perhaps 
even the conservative 
— you would be only 
half-right. There are moments in the first episode, and 
even the rest of the season, that champion traditionalism. 
These plaid-and-Carhartt-clad Quinns mean business. 
Men are men and ladies decorate the tree. Sure, it is a fish-
out-of-water family plot. Yes, some of the jokes encroach 
on outdatedness. But I don’t think that “Merry Happy 
Whatever” gets at anything other than what it’s like to live 
in a traditional, blue-collar family. And that includes the 
bonds that ultimately come with this kind of family.
The first episode is not representative of the entire show. 
The traditions established early on quickly get ruptured, 
and not even by the newly arrived boyfriend. Being a family is difficult, 
and there are natural fissures that erupt in between traditions. Some 
family members struggle with trying to recognize their sexuality, others 

with new-fangled ideas of equality. Even Don, the center of their steady, 
cautious universe, is having difficulty pursuing a new romance after 
being widowed for the better part of his adult life.
Even the in-laws struggle. Expressing themselves and their opinions 
is 
a 
constant 
balancing 
act 
with managing 
to 
stay 
under 
Don’s radar. The 
best of them is 
absolutely 
Joy 
(Elizabeth 
Ho, 
“Disjointed”), 
whose 
wit 
and 
charm 
effectively even 
out the rest of the cast’s frantic attempts to restabilize their continually-
swaying boat. An early interaction with an elderly lady that at first seems 
to be endearing quickly takes a sharp turn, but she handles it with a kind 
of confident, yet self-deprecating grace.
Some may be turned off by “Merry Happy Whatever,” and I 
understand that. A laugh-track was an interesting choice. In the end, it 
doesn’t really offer any answers or solutions. But there aren’t ever any 
satisfying conclusions to family trouble. We bumble our way through it. 
We say some things we probably shouldn’t say. In the end, those who 
love us forgive us, accept us and wake us up on Christmas Day by playing 
“Jingle Bell Rock” as loud as they can at 5 a.m. “Merry Happy Whatever” 
is about neither the “merry” nor the “happy.” It’s all about the “whatever” 
that we ultimately managed to get caught up in. It’s gross. It’s sweet. It’s 
just another Christmas, Hanukkah or December at home. It’s family.

‘Merry Happy Whatever’ is more jolly than it lets on

Merry Happy Whatever

Netflix

Streaming Now

As of right now, I am writing this with my iPod Nano stowed away 
in the bottom drawer of my bedroom dresser. I could sift through it 
the way I would sift through that drawer and revisit just as much 
of my 11-year-old interests. I trace my world back to 2010 with my 
parents’ references to the deaths of the CD and the radio. Somehow, 
2020 seems like a return to form with digital sales of music all but 
entombed. I cannot fathom a music world untethered from the 
streaming world. My interests are far too deep, shamelessly imposed 
by the algorithms of a streaming service. I lived through a time 
where MTV and award shows had the same influence as Spotify’s 
“Today’s Top Hits” playlist, but the transition between the two is 
as fuzzy as fiction to me. The 
span between Frank Ocean’s 2013 
Grammy win and 2017 Grammy 
protest measures a history I have 
yet to understand. Either way, the 
inception of Apple Music was the 
beginning of my appreciation for 
Ocean, too. 
The 
modern 
magic 
of 
music streaming services are 
comfortably contemporary, but 
their ancestry can be traced back 
to the era of Britney Spears’s 
...Baby One More Time. Napster was envisioned by two teenagers in 
1999. “Napster” flowered from co-founder Shawn Fanning’s online 
username into the world’s first music streaming platform. His 
partner Sean Parker took an interest after Fanning shared the idea 
of a software powerful enough to stream shared MP3 files. With the 
combined efforts of Fanning’s programming and Parker’s investment 
strategies, Napster was launched in May 1999. By October of 1999 it 
had over four million songs in circulation. By March of 2000, the 
Napster community had over 20 million members. 
This registered a new millennium with the first-ever dip in global 
record sales. Major record labels went into a frenzy and subsequently 
called for a summit among their various executives. Litigation for 
Napster crossed every angle as companies and acts from Metallica 

to Dr. Dre pelted them with breach of copyright lawsuits. Napster 
was effectively shut down with 50 million members in 2001 as a 
result.
Napster lingers by virtue of its liquidation and obvious influence 
on streaming services like Soundcloud, Apple Music and Spotify. 
Parker and Fanning actually attempted to alter Napster into such 
a platform in its last breath before bankruptcy, but couldn’t secure 
the licensing. Regardless, the idea of a subscription plan turned 
many listeners off from the brand — mail-in money orders simply 
didn’t have the same efficiency as digital, paperless billing. With 
the looming risk of lawsuits still in the air and the technological 
restrictions of 2001, a replacement for Napster never took its place. 
Perhaps it was the plug-in nature of technology at the time or the 
greater value attributed to physical possessions, but the status quo 
for music consumption stuck around. CD sales and airplay were 
still the primary factors for music 
exposure and success. 
The same goes for music genre 
popularity: alternative rock and 
pop music reigned. This trend 
carried on into the early 2010s, 
even with the EDM trend that 
gripped the pop sector. Teen pop 
made a resurgence with popular 
Disney and Nickelodeon shows 
like “Wizards of Waverly Place” 
and “Big Time Rush.” But as the 
world took a turn toward music 
streaming, hip-hop quickly eclipsed other music genres. Rock 
music’s position as the most consumed music genre for over 50 years 
was usurped by hip-hop. 
Despite the rise of music streaming in the mid-2010s, Spotify 
and Soundcloud were established in 2006 and 2007 respectively. 
Their rise and expansion, sans the teen success story, mirrors that 
of Napster. Both centered in Stockholm, they paved their way to 
popularity in Europe before becoming international mammoths. 
This was the very beginning of streaming’s influence; in 2010, 
Spotify was making more money for record labels in Sweden than 
any other brand. By the end of 2011, its subscriber base doubled to 
two million. It doubled yet again by the end of 2012 with over four 
million paid users and a whopping 15 million active users in general. 

As of 2019, Spotify has 26 million paid subscribers and 191 million 
total active users worldwide. Apple Music’s global 28 million paid 
subscribers also comprises a huge chunk of the streaming market.
But how exactly does this tie into the rise of hip-hop? According to 
a 2017 report by Nielsen, hip-hop’s surging popularity was powered 
by a 72 percent increase in on-demand audio streaming. None of this 
is to suggest streaming media did all the work on its own. Hip-hop’s 
artists, producers and labels did the heavy lifting in terms of making 
the genre what it is. Between the rise of massive artists like Drake 
and Kendrick Lamar and the influence of hip-hop labels like Cash 
Money Records and Top Dawg Entertainment, hip-hop built itself 
as force worth reckoning. 
The dynamic of streaming really comes down to its radar of 
exposure. With over 50 million songs under their grip, Apple 
Music and Spotify have the power to expose listeners to music they 
otherwise wouldn’t have discovered with their algorithms. With 
this, the roles of award shows, airplay and television broadcasting 
carry less weight. Listeners now have more autonomy to curate 
more unique and expansive tastes in music without popular bias 
and money enforcing as many constraints. Despite record labels 
adjusting seamlessly to the sway of streaming, they no longer 
prevail as primary determinants of success for an artist. Artists 
can distribute their work directly to listeners without sacrificing 
their style to appeal to labels. This specifically boosts hip-hop in 
two senses: one, more mainstream means of exposure never gave 
the genre the recognition it deserved, and two, hip-hop has more 
of an experimental element to it than other music genres. Whereas 
pop leans more on a label to produce for an artist, hip-hop is more 
fixated on an individual’s skills with production.
The effect is two-fold with streaming and music simultaneously 
shaping one another. Hip-hop specifically grooves with these shifts 
as it takes to more experimental routes. Subgenres like emo-rap 
and trap especially gain benefits as they thrive on platforms like 
Soundcloud. Music and production bounce off one another with 
more ease and individual control now than they have in the past. 
Streaming works to further this relationship through the platform’s 
individualized attention to the tastes of listeners. The platform takes 
into account factors of music the listeners themselves wouldn’t have 
considered to tailor music interests with more unique turns. There 
is less conformity to any particular genre, leading to more exposure 
and collaboration we haven’t seen popular in the past.

Breaking down Michigan’s bowl destination

As much as it feels like 
Michigan’s season ended with 
that performance against Ohio 
State last Saturday, there’s still one 
more game — a consolation bowl, 
somewhere sunny and warm. Get 
hype!
Until Sunday’s selection show 
(or rather, an hour or so before the 
selection show, when someone 
inevitably leaks the placements), 
it’s a guessing game where the 
Wolverines will go and who they 

will play. But as championship 
weekend approaches, the picture 
has begun to come into focus.
For any team that doesn’t make 
a New Year’s Six bowl (yes, this 
includes Michigan), there are a set 
of bowls that are obligated to select 
Big Ten teams. They essentially 
“draft” teams in a predetermined 
order, and unlike New Year’s Six 
bowls, are not obligated to take 
teams based on their records. 
Instead, 
bowls 
usually 
select 
teams based on a combination of 
two factors: how big the fanbase 
is (a bigger fanbase means more 
money for the bowl) and which 
matchups would drive eyeballs to 
TVs (again, money is a bowl’s main 
determinant, and anyone who tells 
you otherwise is lying). The order 

of selection for Big Ten bowls goes 
as such: Citrus, Outback, Holiday, 
Gator, Pinstripe, Redbox, Quick 
Lane, Armed Forces.
But in order to make its 
matchups a little more exciting 
(read: 
in 
hopes 
of 
avoiding 
Michigan playing Florida for the 
28304982th time), the Big Ten has 
a more specific set of rules about 
which teams bowls can select. The 
gist of it is that no bowl is allowed 
to take the same team as it did the 
year before (this doesn’t affect the 
Wolverines, since the Peach Bowl 
is a Playoff bowl this year and, 

well, Michigan isn’t going there) 
and that all bowls must take five 
different teams over the six-year 
span from 2014-19. That means 
the Outback Bowl, which has had 
Iowa twice in that period, can’t 
select any team that has played 
in it since 2014. That includes the 
Wolverines.
We’ll also get this out of the 
way: Michigan isn’t going to the 
Pinstripe, Redbox, Quick Lane or 
Armed Forces bowls. Too much 
earning power.
Now, let’s break down where 
the Wolverines actually could go.
The Citrus Bowl
The Citrus Bowl, which is on 
Jan. 1 in Orlando, has its pick of Big 
Ten teams that aren’t good enough 
for the New Year’s Six. There’s 

been a lot of smoke lately that the 
bowl wants the Wolverines, which 
would make sense given that the 
fanbase travels well. The Citrus 
Bowl could pick Michigan even 
if Wisconsin gets left out of the 
New Year’s Six — and there would 
be a precedent for that, with the 
Outback Bowl picking the 8-4 
Wolverines over a 9-3 Michigan 
State that beat them in 2017.
Should 
Michigan 
head 
to 
Orlando, it would face a team from 
the SEC, which, if the latest College 
Football Playoff rankings are to be 
believed, would be … Alabama.

So. Ready to relive the 2000 
Orange Bowl ad nauseam, then 
witness another season-ending 
blowout?
To be fair, this isn’t a foregone 
conclusion. The Crimson Tide 
could make the New Year’s Six, 
which would probably end with 
the Wolverines playing Auburn 
(though that matchup doesn’t 
inspire a ton more confidence). 
And if a Big Ten team (likely 
Wisconsin) makes the Orange 
Bowl, the conference will be forced 
to hand over its spot in the Citrus 
Bowl to the ACC. Or, the Citrus 
Bowl could surprise us all and 
decide to pick the Badgers.
That would make Michigan’s 
most likely destination…
The Holiday Bowl

The Holiday Bowl is on Dec. 28 
in San Diego, and the only time 
the Wolverines have ever played 
in this bowl was in 1984, when 
6-5 Michigan had to play against 
undefeated, 
top-ranked 
BYU. 
(It lost, while the Cougars were 
named national champions.)
This bowl would love to have the 
Wolverines, especially because its 
opponent would be a Pac-12 team 
— and not just any Pac-12 team, but 
probably USC, which would be a 
perfect opportunity for the bowl to 
sell ’80s Rose Bowl nostalgia.
The confounding factor here is 
Iowa, which, due to the Big Ten’s 
aforementioned rule about repeat 
bowl appearances, cannot go to 
the Outback, Gator or Pinstripe 
bowls. So selecting Michigan for 
the Holiday Bowl would mean the 
Hawkeyes getting majorly screwed 
with a trip to the Redbox Bowl.
Of course, the Holiday Bowl 
doesn’t really care if Iowa gets 
screwed, but the Big Ten — which 
has the final say in all bowl 
selections involving its conference 
— might. If it doesn’t want Iowa 
getting bumped, the Wolverines 
could find themselves in…
The Gator Bowl
The Gator Bowl is on Jan. 2 in 
Jacksonville (#DUUUUVAL). The 
last time Michigan played in this 
bowl, they got blown out so badly 
Rich Rodriguez was fired. So, the 
bar is low.
Should they find themselves 
here, the Wolverines would play 
a team from the SEC. There’s less 
clarity as to what that team would 
be than there is with the other 
bowls, but recent projections have 
offered up Tennessee, Kentucky 
and Mississippi State — all teams 
that finished 6-6 or 7-5.
That would seem to be the easiest 
destination for the Wolverines, 
matchup-wise, but consider that 
whichever middling SEC team got 
matched with Michigan would 
have hell of a lot more motivation 
than the still-reeling-from-Ohio-
State Wolverines.
Michigan’s bowl destination 
fate is out of its hands now. All 
that’s left to do is see what the 
selection committee says.

Juwan Howard readies 
for first Big Ten clash

Juwan 
Howard 
had 
some 
summer homework to attend to.
He had just been hired as the 
new coach of the Michigan men’s 
basketball team, and somewhere 
among his laundry list of new 
responsibilities was getting to 
know his opponents. 
And so he got to work, scouting 
the other Big Ten programs the 
Wolverines would have to face 
this season. 
“I’ve looked at the big picture 
as far as what I’m up against, 
what our goals are and what we’re 
trying to achieve,” Howard said. 
“I knew this summer that I would 
have to get into some of the teams 
we’d normally face throughout 
the conference.”
That process will finally be 
put to use on Friday night when 
Michigan opens up Big Ten play 
against Iowa at Crisler Center. 
Having 
seemingly 
worked 
through the schedule sequentially, 
Howard scouted the Hawkeyes 
before anyone else.
“I have a lot of notes written 
down that I’m reflecting on 
now to prepare for tomorrow’s 
game,” Howard said. “This wasn’t 
something I started a few days 
ago.”
Put on Iowa’s tape from this 
season though, and it’s strengths 
are rather evident — shooting and 
size. 
Coming off the back of a road 
win at Syracuse, the 6-2 Hawkeyes 
enter Friday averaging 79.1 points 
per game while shooting 35 
percent from beyond the arc. 
“They 
have 
great 
outside 
shooting and it comes from one 
through five,” Howard said. “It’s 
not just one guy that shoots the 
ball well, it’s all five guys in their 
starting lineup.” 
As for their size, imposing 
6-foot-11 
junior 
Luka 
Garza 
is averaging 20 points and 10 
rebounds. Cordell Pemsl and Ryan 

Kriener are also lanky options off 
the bench. 
The Wolverines’ impressive 
start to the season has launched 
them from a team predicted to 
finish in the middle of the pack, 
to now one of the conference 
favorites. 
As 
Howard 
knows 
though, the Big Ten features a 
number of solid, experienced 
teams like Iowa that Michigan 
can’t overlook. 
“It’s 
a 
super-competitive, 
physical 
conference,” 
Howard 
said. “A conference that on any 
given night if you don’t bring your 
A game, you’re getting beat. 
“That’s what I can remember 
from my time playing here. 
That’s the reason I chose the Big 
Ten. Nothing against the ACC, 
Pac-12 or the Big East, but I just 
always thought the Big Ten fit 
me. I wanted to be a part of that 
atmosphere and that level of 
competition.”
Howard now gets a second 
stab at competing for a Big 
Ten championship — the only 
exception being this time, it’ll 
be from the sideline as he goes 
head-to-head with some of the 
best coaches in the country. 
Thankfully for Howard, alongside 
a veteran-laden roster he has 
an experienced coaching staff. 
Associate 
head 
coach 
Phil 
Martelli has been around the 
block a few times, assistant 
Howard Eisley is familiar with 
high-level competition and Saddi 
Washington, the lone carryover 
from John Beilein’s staff, has now 
spent three years coaching in the 
Big Ten. 
“It’s 
great 
to 
have 
Saddi 
Washington, 
who’s 
familiar 
with every opponent we’re going 
to face,” Howard said. “He has 
experience and he’s helping guys 
like 
myself, 
Howard 
(Eisley) 
and Phil (Martelli). At the end 
of the day we have a great staff 
that’s been very active wherever 
they can to help us prepare for 
tomorrow.”

Wolverines prepare for pivotal 
series against No. 6 Penn State

Earlier 
this 
week, 
Mel 
Pearson answered a phone call.
The caller talked about how 
the Michigan hockey team (5-9-
2 overall, 1-6-1 Big Ten) has 
looked good at times this year, 
and that it would be nice if it 
can get a split this weekend in 
the home series against No. 6 
Penn State (11-4-0, 6-2-0), the 
leader of the conference.
Such a statement did not sit 
well with Pearson, who expects 
more from the Wolverines.
“And 
I 
said, 
‘What?’ 
” 
Pearson said. “ ‘What? Excuse 
me?’ We just play one at a time. 
We’ll show up Friday, and hey, 
they’re the favorites. Nobody 
expects us to beat them. We’ll 
see what happens Friday.”
There’s 
validity 
to 
the 
caller’s comments. The Nittany 
Lions are an imposing group. 
They returned their top five 
scorers from last season and 
have scored 4.6 goals a game, 
which ranks second in the 
nation. Last year’s team had 
similar offensive success but 
was tarnished by one of the 
nation’s worst defenses.
A lot has changed since then, 
though. Penn State is ranked 
19th in goals against, allowing 
2.4 a night — a substantial 
difference from 3.56 last season. 
And with that improvement, 
Michigan 
is 
slated 
for 
a 
challenging weekend.
Fortunately 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
their 
defensive 
unit has been one of the lone 
bright spots throughout this 
season. They’ll need to build off 
that to make the most out of the 
series.
“This year overall we’ve 
been doing a really good job 
limiting teams to chances and 
goals 
against,” 
said 
senior 
defenseman Griffin Luce. “So 
I think just continuing to do 
what we’ve been doing all year. 
But making sure, especially 
getting pucks out, making sure 
that they definitely get deep 

in their zone so that we don’t 
have those transitions on the 
turnovers. We just got to make 
sure that we don’t give them 
any free opportunities to use 
the offensive instincts that they 
have.”
Most of those instincts stem 
from Penn State forwards Nate 
Sucese and Evan Barratt — the 
team’s top-two point scorers. 
They 
are 
joined 
by 
many 
other proven players, such as 
forwards Liam Folkes and Sam 
Sternschein, who leads the 
team in goals.
“They have an abundance 
of guys who can burn you,” 
Pearson said. “So you just have 
to be really aware of that. But 
then you just got to go play, too. 
You gotta respect them, but you 
can’t fear them.”
Pearson 
hopes 
that 
his 
team can possess the puck 
consistently 
this 
weekend 
and force the Nittany Lions to 
play without it. He mentioned 
that they are able to get a lot 
of pucks on net while sending 
bodies, too, who take advantage 
of bounces when they come. 
Thus, it’s quite important for 
Michigan to limit the turnovers 
— which have been a problem of 
late.
Playing with the lead has 
been 
a 
challenge 
for 
the 
Wolverines a few times this 
season. Michigan has lost after 
reaching a two-goal lead in 
three games so far. If the team 
can get ahead early against 
Penn State, it’ll have to put 

extra focus on maintaining the 
margin.
“I don’t think any lead is safe,” 
Pearson said. “I think that’s 
a good way to put it, against a 
team like them, because they 
can score in bunches. You have 
to be aware of that.”
The Wolverines split both 
series last season. The Nittany 
Lions showcased their offense, 
scoring 17 goals throughout 
the four games. In one of 
Michigan’s victories, though, 
it held Penn State to just one 
goal. That contest was the only 
one at Yost, and the Wolverines 
are quick to say the home crowd 
helped.
Michigan 
has 
been 
historically 
good 
at 
home 
against the Nittany Lions. The 
overall rivalry is close, with the 
Wolverines leading 15-12, but 
Michigan has won nine of 11 at 
Yost.
If 
the 
Wolverines 
can 
stay strong defensively this 
weekend and value the puck 
on the attack, perhaps Pearson 
could show that caller what he 
sees in his group.
“I think we have a pretty 
good 
record 
against 
Penn 
State at Yost, which is good,” 
said 
senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood. “So I think we have 
a lot of confidence going into 
this weekend, even knowing 
that they’re a top-10 team in 
the country. We have a lot of 
confidence, and I think those 
two wins would be absolutely 
huge for us.”

O’Hara is ready for her moment

Maggie O’Hara thought she’d 
broken the floor. 
As she punched out after a near 
perfect round-off back handspring 
she thought she’d hit a dead spot. 
The wood must have broken 
beneath her. 
Instead, she had torn her 
Achilles tendon — a season-ending 
injury.
O’Hara was warming up the 
first pass in what would have been 
her career debut on floor — as a 
junior. Typically she competed 
on beam, but her teammate, 
then-senior Emma McLean, was 
suffering from a shoulder injury 
and was unable to compete. After 
an exhibition performance against 
Alabama, 
O’Hara 
was 
ready, 
stepping into the role without a 
second thought. 
“We needed someone to step 
in,” O’Hara said. “I was like, ‘You 
know what, I can push through 
like one routine.’ ”
O’Hara is not unfamiliar with 
injury. During both her freshman 
and 
sophomore 
season, 
she 
suffered from concussions: the first 
after a bad mount on bars resulted 
in a fist to the head, and the second 
after a poor overshot ended with 
a whiplash into the mat. O’Hara’s 
days of competition were over for 
the time being. With continuous 
recovery programming, O’Hara 
eventually got better — only to 
have her dreams of getting back to 
competition derailed once again at 
the end of her sophomore year.

“It was really frustrating, the 
first one was definitely a learning 
experience,” O’Hara said. “I was 
super excited to get back into my 
sophomore year and I had been 
working hard all summer. The 
second one was just kind of like 
another punch in the stomach.”
Before 
O’Hara’s 
struggles 
with injury came her passion for 
gymnastics. After following in her 
brother’s footsteps, swimming, 
and playing basketball and soccer, 
she ended up in a dance class. After 
a suggestion from her teacher to 
try tumbling, she was hooked. 
“I went to the gym just solely 
to learn how to (tumble) and I was 
like, ‘I’m done, I like this better,’ ” 
O’Hara said.
O’Hara grew up in Lexington, 
S.C. and because her high school 
was without a gymnastics team she 
attended Southeastern Gymnastics 
— a club in Wettington, N.C.
“I lived two hours away from my 
gym so I spent four hours in the car 
every day and still went to a public 
high school, but it was amazing,” 
O’Hara said. “I went to a pretty 
prestigious club gym and it was 
just constant competition within 
the gym which made gymnastics 
both fun and competitive.”
O’Hara’s early commitment to 
gymnastics has proven to be vital 
in her collegiate years and allowed 
her to keep a positive mentality 
through the grueling years of 
recovery.
“I think a lot of just mentally 
putting myself in the place of one 
more day, it’s one more day,” she 
said.

This positive mentality was 
sparked by her former teammate 
Olivia Karas. Karas had torn her 
Achilles at approximately the 
same time the season before. 
Additionally, two other Michigan 
teammates 
have 
torn 
their 
Achilles. 
“Getting back into it, they were 
like, just keep reminding yourself 
it’s going to come back,” O’Hara 
said. “It’s fun to have someone 
who’s gone through it just because 
they are constantly motivating 
you and reminding you that it’s 
possible, and it is going to come 
with time.”
Along with her teammate’s 
support, 
O’Hara’s 
family 
has 
played a crucial role in her 
collegiate career. Her sister Gracie, 
who was born with several health 
issues and is also a gymnast, has 
been O’Hara’s inspiration.
“She’s a constant motivation for 
me,” said O’Hara. “She’s always 
like, ‘Hey look what I did in the 
gym today,’ and I’m like, ‘You 
know, if she can do it so can I.’ ”
After three long years of 
continuous recovery O’Hara is 
ready to get back to competition 
— especially for her senior season. 
She’s returning to the team as 
a senior leader with a renewed 
passion for gymnastics. 
“I’m super excited, we have a 
really strong team this season and 
I love gymnastics if not more than 
I have in the past,” O’Hara said. 
“The thought of being in front 
of fans again and being with my 
team is so motivating. Excited is an 
understatement.”

Nick Blankenburg maintains connection to late grandfather

There’s a railing on the left 
side of the second floor at Yost 
Ice Arena, overlooking the ice. 
It’s in the corner, tucked away 
just off the staircase and next 
to the stands on the short side.
It’s where Nick Blankenburg 
stands before every practice 
and every home game.
Every 
single 
one 
of 
Michigan’s 
players 
has 
a 
particular spot for his pregame 
routine, 
whether 
it’s 
Jack 
Summers — who wears No. 6 — 
sitting on the sixth seat in the 
stands or Jake Slaker laying in 
the back hallway by the locker 
room with his legs up the wall.
But for Blankenburg, this 
railing is his spot.
When 
the 
sophomore 
defenseman played his first 
game at Yost last October, 
he wasn’t sure where he was 
going to stand to stretch and 
visualize before the game. He 
gravitated toward the left side 
of the building, and he found 
the railing over there.
And then he looked down 
and realized his grandfather — 
Richard Orkisz, better known 
as Pops — had the seats just 
below the railing, in the corner, 
on the glass.
Blankenburg 
could 
wave 
hello or send a wink down to his 
grandfather before each game. 
He knew then that he’d found 
his place.
For as long as Blankenburg’s 
mom, Karin — Orkisz’s daughter 
— can remember, her dad was 
the definition of a rink rat. 
Any 
time 
one 
of 
his 
grandchildren had a hockey 
game or even a practice, they 
could count on Pops to be there. 
As Blankenburg got older and 
progressed from AAA hockey 
to high school hockey, his 
grandfather was a constant 
presence at the rink. Romeo 
High School was only about five 
minutes from Orkisz’s house.
Sometimes, he’d get to the 

games even before Blankenburg 
did. When Blankenburg would 
pull into the parking lot, he’d 
see Orkisz’s car parked in 
the handicapped spot. Both 
Blankenburg and Karin are 
quick to clarify that Orkisz 
wasn’t 
handicapped 
in 
the 
traditional sense, but his heart 
wasn’t the best and walking 
long distances was difficult for 
him.
“My dad would just be sitting 
at a table eating a hot dog and a 
bag of chips and a pop,” Karin 
said. “Waiting for Nick.”
When Blankenburg moved 
from playing for metro Detroit-
based Victory Honda to playing 
for 
the 
Okotoks 
Oilers 
in 
Alberta, Canada, Orkisz could 
no longer attend every practice 
and every game.
But that didn’t stop him from 
keeping up with his grandson 
every time he stepped onto the 
ice.
Orkisz kept Oilers’ 2017-
18 
schedule 
at 
his 
house, 
painstakingly filled out after 
every game with the score and 
whether Blankenburg got any 
points in the game. Finding 
that schedule showed Karin 
everything she needed to know 
about her dad’s relationship 
with her son.
“I don’t think I had anyone 
that was a bigger fan than him,” 
Blankenburg said.
When 
Blankenburg 
came 
to Ann Arbor on a visit, Karin 
decided to tell her dad the 
secret that they weren’t sharing 
with many people — that Nick 
was visiting Michigan and may 
play hockey for the Wolverines.
Orkisz’s jaw dropped.
No one in the family ever 
expected Blankenburg to end 
up at Michigan, and it was a 
dream come true for the whole 
family when it happened — 
especially Orkisz.
“He 
couldn’t 
get 
tickets 
fast 
enough,” 
Karin 
said. 
“And he was, I don’t want to 
say handicapped, but he was 
older, so it was harder for him 

to get up and down the stairs. 
So, when those glass seats 
were 
available, 
considered 
handicapped seats, that was 
perfect because we dropped 
him off right by the door, he got 
his hot dog, used the bathroom 
and then was cozy in his seat 
for the next three hours.”
And 
when 
Blankenburg 
realized his grandfather sat 
right below the railing on the 
left side, he decided to stand 
there before each game and 
give Orkisz a wink or say hi.
When Karin came to her 
first Michigan game, a few 
weeks into the season, her dad 
couldn’t wait to tell her all 
about their pregame moments.
And 
in 
warmups, 
Blankenburg 
always 
made 
eye contact with his biggest 
fan — a brief shared moment 
for grandfather and grandson 
among the chaos before a game.
Blankenburg 
was 
at 
the 
Mall of America on a Thursday 
morning in March when he 
got a call from his mother. He 
instantly knew it was about his 

Pops.
Orkisz’s health had begun 
to decline in January after 
heart 
surgery 
and 
ensuing 
complications, and the family 
knew the end was coming — but 
Blankenburg didn’t expect to 
get the call so soon.
Orkisz had been suffering 
from the flu and Karin took 
him to the hospital. It looked as 
though things were trending in 
a positive direction, and Karin 
was preparing to quit her job 
and move in with her dad to 
take care of him as he regained 
his strength.
“The day that he died, I saw 
him,” Karin said. “I was there 
from like — I went there after 
work. I stayed with him from 
like three to five, I brought him 
some soup, and then I just went 
home. I had something to do.
“And like two hours after I 
got home, my phone rang, and 
it was the hospital. I thought 
like, ‘Oh! They’re releasing 
him.’ … They told me that he 
was in cardiac arrest for like 45 
minutes and they were trying 

to revive him and what did they 
want me to do.”
Both Nick and his older 
brother 
Alex 
— 
then 
a 
goaltender for the University 
of Nebraska-Omaha — were on 
the road with their respective 
teams. After Orkisz passed on 
the Wednesday night, Karin 
didn’t want to call her sons and 
distract them. But then their 
oldest sister found out, and 
Karin knew she had to tell them 
before someone else did.
So, standing in the middle 
of Nordstrom with four of 
his teammates, Blankenburg 
answered the phone and heard 
Karin at the other end of the 
connection. He told her he was 
at the Mall of America, hanging 
out with his friends.
“Yeah, don’t really have good 
news for you,” Karin said.
“What? 
Is 
it 
Pops?” 
Blankenburg 
replied, 
and 
his mom told him what had 
happened.
“Pops 
would 
have 
never 
wanted you to come home 
or stop playing hockey or 

whatever,” Karin said. “Just 
stay where you’re at. Pops 
would want you to play.”
The Great Lakes Invitational 
Tournament 
last 
December 
was the last time Orkisz saw 
Blankenburg play hockey in 
person.
When 
Michigan’s 
first 
home 
series 
rolled 
around 
last 
January, 
Blankenburg 
looked down at the spot his 
grandfather always occupied 
and found it empty. His health 
wasn’t good enough for him to 
travel to see his grandson play.
But Blankenburg stood at 
the railing anyway, just as he 
always had.
And when he took the ice 
for warmups, he looked again 
at that seat in the left corner. 
Instead of making eye contact 
or throwing Orkisz a wink, he 
skated over and touched his 
knuckles to the glass in front of 
where his grandfather always 
sat.
When he returned to Yost 
this fall for the first game 
of this season, Blankenburg 
continued his usual routine 
at the railing. It’s a part of his 
pregame preparation now, and 
he has no intention of changing 
it just because his Pops doesn’t 
sit underneath it anymore.
“I feel like it was nice 
knowing that he was up in 
heaven with my grandma and 
they were both looking down 
on me, watching over me,” 
Blankenburg said. “I was happy 
to know that he was in a better 
place, and he had the best seat 
in the house.”
Blankenburg 
still 
gives 
Orkisz a knuckle touch through 
the glass before every game. It’s 
his way of remaining connected 
to the man that was always 
his biggest fan and strongest 
supporter.
Orkisz was at every game, 
every practice, everything he 
could be for Blankenburg’s 
entire hockey career.
And Blankenburg knows he’s 
still there every day.

Out of the blue

Michigan stages comeback late in fourth quarter, tops Syracuse in overtime, 84-76, for first power-conference win

Michigan’s 
players 
looked 
up. Two minutes remained in 
overtime. They led Syracuse by 
five. They could have dug in their 
heels, played drop-back defense 
and waited for the clock to bleed 
down. 
But there would be no waiting 
in this game.
Senior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson jumped on a bad pass 
by guard Teisha Hyman, broke to 
the basket and picked up an and-
one. 
The Wolverines didn’t look 
back on their way to an 84-76 win 
over Syracuse. 
Even getting to overtime took 
a near miracle from Michigan. 
Midway 
through 
the 
fourth 
quarter, the Orange held a nine-
point 
lead, 
and 
Michigan’s 
offense was reeling. It had only 
hit one field goal in the quarter. 
In 
desperate 
times, 
the 
Wolverines needed a spark, and 
it was their defense that provided 
it. Coach Kim Barnes Arico dialed 
up a full-court press in hopes 
of forcing turnovers, and it paid 
dividends.
Starting with a quick bucket 
after a steal from sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon, Michigan 
scored eight of the next 10 points 
— all of which came off Syracuse 
turnovers. 
“It was Naz at the front of that 
press, and (sophomore guard) 
Amy (Dilk) and (Johnson) right 
behind her,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They’re so long and disruptive, 
and they were so tough.
From 
the 
beginning, 
it 
was clear the game would be 
a nailbiter, with both teams 
reaching double digits before the 
first TV timeout. Junior forward 
Hailey Brown set the tone right 
away, driving past the Orange 
defense and drawing a foul less 
than 15 seconds in. She sunk both 
free throws. 
Every time one team made a 
big play that felt like a turning 
point, the other side would come 
right back with a quick bucket 
of its own. Much of this came 

from 
Syracuse’s 
high-volume 
performance from beyond the 
arc, especially early on. In the 
first quarter alone, it buried 5-of-
10 triples, three of which came 
from Hyman, who had previously 
made just two 3-pointers all 
season.
But 
the 
Wolverines’ 
adjustments on defense — and 
Hyman sitting out with foul 
trouble 
— 
meant 
Syracuse 
couldn’t quite maintain that 
same pace from downtown later 
in the game. Michigan’s press 
continued to fluster the Orange’s 
shooters, forcing poor passes and 
hurried shots. They made just five 
3-pointers in the second half. 
“We tried to keep switching 
defenses on them,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We tried not to stay in the 
same thing so they couldn’t get 
comfortable.”
Offensively, senior forward 
Kayla Robbins was the biggest 
difference-maker 
for 
the 

Wolverines. She led the team 
with 23 points, including a layup 
with just over a minute left that 
gave Michigan a one-point lead.
Once overtime started, it was 
all Wolverines. They outscored 
Syracuse, 13-5, in the extra period, 
making almost no mistakes and 
sinking a number of crucial free 
throws to seal the victory.
Going in, Michigan knew that 
Syracuse’s zone defense could 
cause problems — especially 
with the turnover woes that the 
Wolverines have endured this 
year. But they took care of the 
ball, found holes in the zone and 
picked up a signature win along 
the way. 
“We focused on worrying 
about ourselves, because as much 
as we focused in on their defense 
and their offense, they have to 
also worry about us,” Hillmon 
said. “So we just played our game. 
We knew that something would 
come to us.”

Down 
by 
10 
with 
eight 
minutes left, Syracuse had all 
the momentum. Two straight 
3-pointers 
appeared 
to 
put 
daggers in Michigan’s hopes as 
the game slipped out of reach.
Then a shooting foul gave 
freshman guard Michelle Sidor a 
chance at the line. She sank both 
of them. A scramble for the ball 
30 seconds later in the backcourt 
gave sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon an easy layup to bring 
the game within seven.
“When we got down 10, we 
knew we were gonna have to turn 
it up,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico after a game her 
team came back to win, 84-76, 
over Syracuse in overtime. “I 
think you just saw the spark in 
Hillmon, and Hillmon coming 
alive in the front of the press. 
Nobody wants to face that. Her 

(6-foot-7) wingspan, and that’s 
really what she has, was really 
tough for their point guard.”
Never mind that, the Orange 
would do what they did every 
time the Wolverines attempted 
to claw themselves back into the 
game — hit threes.
Instead, a trap from sophomore 
guard Amy Dilk on the far side 
of the court gave Michigan the 
ball back. Senior forward Kayla 
Robbins, playing with four fouls, 
forced a turnover and put up a 
layup. It was a five-point game.
Syracuse made it halfway up 
the court before senior guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson 
forced 
a 
turnover, 
found 
Robbins 
streaking down the court for 
an easy layup — the deficit now 
three.
The Orange scored again. 
They turned the ball over again, 
the Wolverines scored again.
For once, Michigan wasn’t 
the team giving up possessions. 

There was no room for Syracuse 
to breathe as the Wolverines 
executed a nasty press. The 
Orange 
committed 
seven 
turnovers in the fourth quarter 
and five in overtime. They gave 
up 31 points off turnovers — 21 in 
the fourth quarter and overtime.
“It’s all with the top line,” 
Robbins said. “When you have 
(Hillmon’s) length up top, with 
her length in the press when 
we’re down, she’s done it plenty 
of times before — no one can 
stop it. No one can get through 
our first-line defense when we’re 
down.”
Added Hillmon: “But it doesn’t 
work without the second line 
being there with the traps, so 
that’s another thing of everybody 
working together, knowing what 
spots they’re supposed to be in 
and even when it did break down 
a couple times we didn’t put our 
head down, we got right back 
into it and still tried to get those 
stops.”
For a minute, the game looked 
to sit back into the normal 
rhythm. Like it did in the third 
quarter when the Wolverines 
forced an abundance of turnovers 
to bring the game within three, 
only to lose it just as soon as it 
began.
There 
were 
two 
minutes 
where Michigan dominated the 
glass, gained rebounds, forced 
turnovers, only to miss its shot. 
But Syracuse was impotent and 
turned the ball over again. The 
Wolverines worked their way 
into a one-point lead off a Robbins 
layup with just a minute left.
Michigan 
calmed 
down, 
and when it was unable to trap 
the Orange in the backcourt, it 
swarmed the arc — Hillmon and 
junior forward Hailey Brown a 
brick wall in the paint.
To start overtime, Syracuse 
committed a turnover. And then 
another. The Wolverines were 
up by four in a flash while the 
Orange were drowning.
Up by 10 with a minute left in 
overtime, the momentum was 
all with Michigan. Two free 
throws put a dagger in the heart 
of Syracuse.
