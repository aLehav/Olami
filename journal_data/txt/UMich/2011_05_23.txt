UNIVERSITY STAFF
'U' Regents
appoint new
VP position
Lisa Rudgers
approved as vice
president of global
communications
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily Staff Reporter
Former University Vice Presi-
dent for Communications Lisa
Rudgers will assume the newly
created position of vice president
for global communications and
strategic initiatives at the Univer-
sity starting on June 1.
At their monthly meeting on
Thursday, the University Board
of Regents approved the appoint-
ment of Rudgers to the position,
which will replace the existing
office of vice president for com-
munications. She will be responsi-
ble for developing communication
strategies to augment the Univer-
sity's local, national and interna-
tional presence.
According to a May 19 press
release from the University, the
vice president for global commu-
nications and strategic initiatives
will be the University's foremost
communications job. ttudgers
served as vice president for com-
munications from 2000 to 2007,
and during that time led commu-
nications related to presidential
and university initiatives, accord-
ing to the release.
David Lampe, former vice
president for communications
and recently appointed executive
director of research communica-
tions, said he supports Rudgers'
appointment, especially since he
worked closely with her when he
served as vice president for com-
munications from fall 2007 until

Kentucky scores
twice in last frame to
eliminate Wolverines
By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Reporter
It was the ending that no one
saw coming for the No. 2 Michigan
softball team. With the bases load-
ed and only_
one out in MICHIGAN 1
the bottom KENTUCKY 2
of the sev-
enthinningforKentucky,itseemed
both inevitable and impossible.
Assoon asthe Wildcats'Annie
Rowland's soft blooper started its
arc downward, everyone knew the
game was over. Kentucky won 2-1,
upsetting the Wolverines on their

home field for the second day in
a row to bounce them from the
NCAA postseason.
Entering the seventh inning,
Michigan held a 1-0 lead, but by
the time Kentucky put its bats
away, the damage was done.
"They made a lot of greatplays
out there," junior third baseman
Amanda Chidester said. "Every-
one came ready to play. It was
going to come down to the end.
And it did."
Michigan (18-2 Big Ten, 53-6
overall) grabbed the early lead
after freshman catcher Caitlin
Blanchard scored sophomore Jac-
lyn Crummey on a two-out error
in the fourth.
Kentucky pitcher Rachel Riley
tossed a one-hitter, closing out the
top of the seventh by putting away
three straight Michigan batters.

But it never seemed like
enough, even with senior pitcher
Jordan Taylor on the mound for
the Wolverines.
"Jordan was pitching really
well, but one run against a team
like that offers no comfort zone,"
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
said. "There's a reason we play
seven innings."
Despite playing the NCAA
Regional finale at home in Ann
Arbor, the Wolverines were the
away team Sunday afternoon, giv-
ing the Wildcats (14-9 SEC, 39-14)
one last chance to score.
And they took it.
Taylor struck out 10 heading
into the final inning. She needed
three outs in order for Michigan
to force a tiebreaker game for the
NCAA Super Regionalsbid.

'U' Autism Center to close after director resigns

In wake of closure,
new program to
develop in 2012
By CLAIRE HALL
Daily Staff Reporter
Catherine Lord, director of the
University of Michigan Autism and
Communication Disorders Center,
will be leaving the University this
fall to open a new autism center in
New York City.
Her departure will conse-
quently lead to the closure of the
center, primarily built around
her research. Despite the loss of
UMACC, the University will still
be working toward developing
autism research programs in the
future, and current research ini-
tiatives funded by the federal gov-
ernment will continue after she
leaves.
According to information
provided to The Michigan Daily,
by the University, the University
Health System will look to develop
a new "comprehensive and multi-
disciplinary program to evaluate
children with autism" in 2012 in
response to the loss.
The new program will come
in addition to those that current-

ly exist for patients with autism
using the University Health Sys-
tem, which include a number of
clinics within the Department of
Pediatrics and the Department of
Psychiatry.
Additionally, Lord said the two
federally funded studies currently
being conducted by UMACC will
continue following her departure
so as not to disrupt patients' treat-
ment. Other UMACC patients,
Lord said, will be introduced to
other services available in the Ann
Arbor area.
Lord said she thinks it's unfor-
tunate that the University is shut-
ting down UMACC because it will
end the care it currently provides
for children with autism and their
families, adding that she feels the
center serves an important need
for the community. "I think we do
serve a particular need because on
campus there really isn't another
center that provides family-ori-
ented care for kids and families
and adults," she said.
The new autism center that
Lord will establish in New York,
the Institute for Brain Develop-
ment, is scheduled to open its doors
in late 2012. The Institute will
operate in collaboration with New
York Presbyterian Hospital, the
home of Wiell Cornell Medical Col-

lege and Columbia University Col-
lege of Physicians and Surgeons,
Lord said.
Lord said the Institute will also
benefit from having the ability to
hire junior faculty. This isa signifi-
cant change from UMACC, where
Lord herself was the only faculty
member on staff. She said she was
pleased that the New York center
will be supported by a group rather
than just one individual.
Lord added that she resisted
the move to New York at first, but
eventually the opportunity to set
up a new autism center persuaded
her. She said the fact that her chil-
dren have established careers in
New York City made the timing
seem right.
Lord also said the new Insti-
tute will have more funding and
research opportunities compared
to what is available at the Univer-
sity, though they will have similar
initiatives.
"Hopefully we'll be more inte-
grated into the medical system,
and then also we will have philan-
thropic support so we'll be able to
subsidize some things that we just
can't do here in Michigan," Lord
said.
Donor funding will allow the
New York center to provide more
support and assistance for families

with members who have autism
and other developmental disor-
ders, Lord said. She explained that
such programs can be difficult to
sustain in Michigan because they
aren't usually covered by health
insurance.
In addition to her work at the
center, Lord will continue teaching
in New York at Teachers College,
Columbia University's Graduate
School of Education.
"Although that's not going to
be my main job, I really want to
keep in touch with teaching," Lord
said.
Lord will only be teaching
graduate students, though she said
she would like to work with under-
graduates again in the future.
"We hope we can affiliate
with undergraduate programs just
because the undergraduates here
at (the University) have been so
important to us," Lord said. "We
just have an army of undergradu-
ates who help us do almost every-
thing that we do."
Despite her departure, Lord
said it has been a joy to teach at the
University and to be a part of both
the psychology department and
UMACC.
"I think this is an amazing
university," Lord said. "It's been a
wonderful experience."

"At this point, the businesses

to come with a full disclosure of

their products, as well as the dis-

Jun said he thinks the biggest
obstacle is that corporations need
to be motivated to do their part to
use funding for sustainable initia-

the general public to encourage
them to do.
"We created all these goals
and standards but enforcement

 New fellowship program to fund master's degrees in education

Program gives
students hands on
experiences in state
S secondary schools
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michigan is
one of six universities in the state
participating in a new teacher
fellowship program - the W.K.
Kellogg-Woodrow Wilson Michi-
gan Teaching program - that
aims to improve science and math
education in the state by hiring a
diverse set of teachers for urban
and rural classrooms.
Beverly Sanford, spokes-
woman for the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation,
said the 92 program fellows were
selected out of a pool 1,500 appli-
cants. These fellows will receive
a $30,000 educational stipend to
fund an innovative type of mas-
ter's degree in teaching that will
focus on creating a hands-on
experience in exchange for teach-

"I was preparing my mid-game
speech," Kentucky coach Rachel
Lawson said about headinginto the
bottom half of the seventh inning.
But Wildcat Megan Aull, the
first batter to face Taylor, sparked
something for Kentucky. She hit a
home run over the right-field wall,
squeezing it just inside the foul
pole to tie the score, 1-1.
Taylor tried to pitch low
against her next few batters to
prevent another long ball, but she
missed the strike zone eight pitch-
es in a row to put two runners on.
A hit-by-pitch followed, loading the
bases for Kentucky with no outs on
the board.
"I'm very impressed with Ken-
tucky," Hutchins said. "We were
going to make them swing if they
were going to beat us."
Rowland must have received
that message.
Taylor rallied back with a
strikeout against pinch hitter Lau-
ren Cumbess, putting new life back
into Alumni Field. But Rowland
- who was 0-2 on the day - con-
nected for a blooper over senior
first baseman Dorian Shaw's head

ing at least three years of math or
science in high-need Michigan
secondary schools.
Sanford said the program was
implemented to recruit strong
candidates from science, tech-
nology, engineering and math
backgrounds, adding that it's
often difficult to recruit people
from these subjects, since there
is more prestige 'associated with
practicing in the fields rather
than teaching the subject in a
classroom.
"There's a shortage of teach-
ers in those fields in Michigan,"
she said. "Especially in rural and
urban schools, it'svery hard to get
people who are well qualified to
commit to those schools ... where
there are a lot of pressures, where
there are not a lot of resources."
According to Sanford, the Uni-
versity was chosen as one of the
schools for the program because
of its strong teacher education
program. Other participating
universities include Eastern
Michigan University, Wayne
State University, Grand Valley
State University, Michigan State
University and Western Michi-
to bring the game-winning run -
and NCAA Super Regional bid - in
for Kentucky.
This will be the Wildcats' first
NCAA Super Regional bid in pro-
gram history.
The game began as a pitcher's
duel, with Riley and Taylor each
not allowing much movement
around the bases. The Wildcats
were able to put two runners on
to threaten the Wolverines, but
Blanchard came up big for Michi-
gan to throw out runners in both
the first and fifth innings.
After the Wolverines' unearned
run put them up 1-0 in the top of
the fourth, sophomore second
baseman Ashley Lane was the only
batter to earn a hit, breaking Riley's
no-hitter in the sixth.
But a lack of base runners, fol-
lowed by a seventh-inning threat
by Kentucky caused the Wolver-
ines' season to come to an unex-
pected halt.
The Wolverines will now say
goodbye to six seniors, including
Shaw and Taylor, whose careers
have made history in the Michigan
softball program.
"We just have to fight every
day," Chidester said after the game.
"You can't take anything for grant-
ed - just got to keep going."

gan University.
Arthur Levine, president of
the Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation, said
the main reason the program
was introduced in Michigan is
because of the shortage of math
and science teachers in high-need
districts where student achieve-
ment tends to be lowest.
Levine added that the program
fellows who were ultimately
chosen are highly qualified indi-
viduals with diverse professional
backgrounds, ranging from zoo-
keeper to engineer.
"These people have the capac-
ity to make science very, very
real," Levine said. "If we can
explain to students why mathe-
matics matters, or why you might
study geometry, algebra or calcu-
lus, that's a huge plus."
Dana Linnane, policy commu-
nications manager for the W.F.
Kellogg Foundation, said the
foundation's mission is to support
"vulnerable children" and that
the program is a positive way to
impact Michigan's educational
future in light of recent educa-
tional budget cuts.

"This isn't just a fellowship
program for workforce," she said.
"This is to get high quality teach-
ers in classrooms, to educate kids
in disciplines that they need to
be successful, and that Michigan
needs to be successful... "
Alicia Lane, a University alum
and program fellow, said she
applied for the Fellowship after
working as a civil engineer for
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer-
ing and as a volunteer teacher
for ACT and SAT prep,courses
for high schools in Detroit. She
said her experiences in Detroit
made her realize that she enjoyed
teaching.
Lane added that the program
fellows have a wide range of
experiences, and their diversity
contributes to the effectiveness
of the program.
"Diversity is important for any
aspect for anything that you do,"
Lane said. "In an organization,
not only do you need a diversity
of skill, you need to have a diver-
sity of experiences, backgrounds,
origins, nationalities. It only
makes your company, organiza-
tion, your project stronger by

having a variety of tools in your
tool box."
Lane said that she is looking
forward to teaching schools in
high-need areas, though she is
aware that it may not be an easy
feat.
"The ACT and SAT students
that we serve come from all over
the city, and a lot of the times
they are high-need already," Lane
said. "It will be a challenge for
sure, but it's not one that I am
unfamiliar with."
Karen Epstein, a University
alum and Fellow who worked as a
professor for several years, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
was excited to pursue secondary
education as a career because she
finds the challenge of teaching
high schools students empower-
ing.
"I believe that all schools,
regardless of location, should
provide students with a qual-
ity education," Epstein wrote.
"As a member of society, I can-
not watch this country lose more
children because a poor educa-
tion limits their future options. I
want tobe part of the solution."

Don't snut safety
Firefighters shouldn't be on the chopping block
The Ann Arbor Fire Department may go up in smoke this
afternoon. The City Council will vote today on the two-
year budget recommendation proposed by former City
Administrator Roger Fraser. Featuring some of the steepest cuts
to the city employees in recent years, Fraser's proposal slashes
the city's fire department, which has already been the subject
of previous austerity measures. The budget's vast reduction in
the number of local firefighters, along with cutbacks in equip-
ment and stations, compromises the safety of students and resi-
dents alike. The City Council should not pass this budget as it
will cripple an already-depleted fire department.

The University of Michigan
boasts accomplishments in research
and other world-renowned pro-
grams. But it
should equally
strive to produce
students will-
ing to promote
diversity and
contribute to
society on a glob-
al scale. Learn- NICK
ing outside the
U.S. classroom BRINGARDNER
improves the
overall educa-
tion of students, and the best way to
do this is to bolster study, work and
volunteer abroad programs offered
to provide opportunities for inter-
national experiences.
The Men's Glee Club (myself
included) went on a five-day, four-
night trip to Cuba for its 2011 Spring
Tour. Because of the nature of the
trip, we spent most of our time
sequestered in a tour bus, hotels,
rehearsals or among other foreign-
ers. Only a few times did I feel we
were experiencing real Cuban cul-
ture. However, in Havana we sang
with students from the Escuela
Nacional de Musica - a boarding
school that prepares high school
aged students for careers in music.
We shared songs, danced and
learned that music and creative
expression transcends political
and cultural borders. That one
afternoon provided us with pos-
sibly the most amazing musical
experience of our lives. And from
our conversations with the locals,
it provided a window into the lives
of Cuban people, who aren't too
different from ourselves.
Before the trip, Glee Clubbers
revealed their ignorance of Cuba
by asking somewhat ridiculous
questions about the country or
expressing frustration about being
unable to bring back cigars and
rum - but the trip changed all this.
We can now speak proudly from
experience and sing the praises
not only of the rum and cigars, but
also of the people we met there. In
addition to exposing us to the vast
richness of Cuban culture, the trip
forced Glee Clubbers to reevaluate
their prejudices towards the coun-
try. With programs like this, the
University can foster better inter-
national relationships by changing
Cubans' perception of Americans,
and vice versa.
Students gain valuable experi-
ences when they venture outside
the U.S. Any experience abroad is

great, butI would go a step further
and suggest not just studying, work-
ing or volunteering abroad, but
doing these in a culture completely
different from our own. Maybe
even doing them in a country sepa-
rate from the Western world or one
that doesn't speak English. Travel-
ing far away from home helps us
gain a heightened sense of belong-
ing, because we realize we are of a
global community.
Yet for all its benefits traveling
abroad doesn't happen enough.
According to a 2009 statistical
report from the University's Inter-
national Center, 3,024 students had
an educational experience abroad
in the 2007-2008 school year -
approximately 8 percent of the total
student population. Whether it's
studying, working or volunteering
abroad, the percentage of students
who have an international experi-
ence at least once duringthe spanof
their education should be 100 per-
cent. In his 2007 Commencement
Learning
outside the U.S.
is essential.
Address at the University, President
Clinton said, "Whether you leave
here asa scientist, a writer, an engi-
neer, a business person or an artist,
remember this: you must be a citi-
zen. And it is more important now
than ever before, but it has always
been the truth that the world you
live in is interdependent." The
opportunities already exist in the
form of programs to engage in
opportunities abroad. It's simply
time for us to go out and be citizens
of the world. Doing so doesn't auto-
matically imply an expensive study
abroad program; affordable oppor-
tunities exist within and beyond
the University.
I hope our new relationship
with Cuba can become a regu-
lar exchange on the micro level
and have a political effect on the
macro level. Having educated rep-
resentatives of the U.S. reshapes
impressions citizens of other
countries have of us. And if we can
make a real impact along the way,
then all the better.

Currently, Ann Arbor employs
89 firefighters, who service a city
with a population of 110,000 -
significantly less than cities with
similar populations. One of these
cities, Lansing, employs 200 fire-
fighters. The new budget will
leave the Ann Arbor Fire Depart-
ment with only 77 positions, con-
tinuing the downward trend in
both standards and funding for
the fire department. The amount
of fire fighters staffed per day has
dropped from 24 in the 1990s to
15 in 2011. In response to the per-
sonnel reduction, the department
has been forced to shut down sta-
tions and fire trucks on a rotating
basis. The new budget will fur-
ther degrade the quality of pro-
tection for University students
and the Ann Arbor population as
a whole.
The most significant result
of these cuts is the increase in
response time to emergencies,
which has already been rising
due to previous cuts. As response

times will inevitably increase, the
safety of Ann Arbor will continue
to be compromised. According to
Matt Schroeder, president of the
Ann Arbor firefighter's union,
there have been 12 deaths from
fires in Ann Arbor since 2006.
Certainly a fire department oper-
ating with more staff, fire stations
and trucks would have at least had
a better chance of saving these
lives. Trivial attempts to reduce
the amount of fires, like the recent
couch ban will have little effect
on fire safety, whereas dramatic
cuts like this will undoubtedly
make fires more dangerous.
Its addition to residents of the
city, the safety of the Univer-
sity will be diminished by these
severe cuts. The population
count mentioned above does not
take into account the roughly
40,000 people at the University.
If the fire department is already
understaffed, it is gravely under-
manned when the population of
the University is considered. It

may have its own police force, but
cuts to the fire department can-
not be counteracted by the Uni-
versity. The city of Ann Arbor,
which benefits immensely from
the University, must make sure it
provides sufficient fire safety for
students
In tough economic times it may
be unavoidable to curtail certain
government expenditures, but
cutting vital safety services in
such drastic ways undermines
the primary purpose of govern-
ment - to protect its citizens. The
city found money to construct a
massive underground parking
structure and has budgeted over
$345,000 for new bathrooms
in City Hall. Surely something
else can be sacrificed in the bud-
get that won't have such severe
consequences. For the safety of
everyone living in Ann Arbor,
whether they live here perma-
nently or temporarily as students,
the proposed cuts to the fire
department must be thrown out.

Rainbow is my favorite color. But
I can't get excited about this movie
- in fact, it kind of frustrates me.
This movie makes me react the
same way I did with the momen-
tous repeal of "don't ask, don't tell"
in December 2010 - first: "Great,
what took so long?", followed by:
"This doesn't change everything."
Despite Julianne Moore cud-
dling with a woman on screen and
Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Led-
ger winning MTV's "Best Kiss"
award for "Brokeback Mountain",
who can actually call Hollywood
- let alone America - gay friend-
ly? Whenever a movie comes out
featuring a gay couple, everyone
around me seems to celebrate -
"Look! Gays on the big screen!
It's the end of homophobia!" Of
course, these blockbuster films,
along with others such as "A Single
Man" and "Milk" are a huge step
in the direction of making people
more comfortable with homosex-
uality. But sometimes these mov-
ies seem commercial rather than
genuine, with viewers bragging
about their tolerance. Hollywood
still manufactures gender roles up
the wazoo, still ignores bisexual-
ity, transsexuality and BDSM, still
makes it seem like the only "nor-
mal" is heterosexuality. And that's
why I'm annoyed with people giv-
ing a huge "Hoorah!" when mov-
ies like "The Kids Are All Right"
come out (pun intended) - we're
only at the tip of the iceberg. We're
only seeing movies that don't
make people too uncomfortable.
It's a start. It's not the end.
Homosexuality is no longer
classified in the Diagnostics and
Statistics Manual of Mental Disor-
ders as a mental illness, as it used
to be. Organizations for LGBTQ
teens and students exist, making it

easier to come out and meet simi-
larly identified people, which is a
great new resource. Lady Gaga is
breaking ground, exploring new
frontiers of bringing realistic sex-
uality into the media. But what
else can be done to make LGBTQ
identities as mainstream as het-
erosexuality? What new argu-
ments can be made? I'm worried
that recent films with gay protago-
nists only try to be a band-aid for
deep problems of intolerance, and
that they're only preaching to the
choir. Homophobia and prejudice
against people identifying as queer
has a long history in America and
in the rest of the world, and just
like racism and sexism, it won't
just end with a few movies and
songs. We need education, we
need conversation and we need it
to be okay for people of the same
gender to walk down the street
holding hands.
So cheers, Hollywood, for tak-
ing another step towards sexual-
ity equality. Keep going. I dare
you to eliminate fear and preju-
dice and to stop making it seem
like women must have long hair
to be considered sexy, or that guys
have to dress like guys. I dare you
to make me less nervous about
posting my name on this article.
I dare you to make it not "gay" to
talk about queer rights. Because
seriously, it's time. I promise to
see "The Kids Are All Right" if
Hollywood makes a movie version
of "Middlesex" by Jeffrey Eugen-
ides, or if they feature a rainbow
flag in "Transformers 3". I might
even promise to see "We Now Pro-
nounce You Chuck and Larry" if
they make a movie where they at
least mention bisexuality, or one
where a girl wears a tux to a wed-
ding. Hollywood definitely has the
power to change minds and opin-
ions, to make people more open
and accepting. I want to see this in
action, and I want to see it soon.

Democracy 2.0

2011 has been a year of unri-
valed pro-democracy activ-
ism around the world. The
Arab Spring,
chock-full of
revolution,
governmental
change, war
and protest ;
has altered the
dynamics of
the region for- JONATHAN
ever. Whether AYLWARD
its role has been
overempha-
sized or not,
relatively recent developments in
technology have played an unde-
niable role in aiding organization
and communication among activ-
ists. The world is craving democ-
racy and technology is providing
a means of attaining it.
So what? This is the U.S. We've
already got democracy, right?
In the last presidential elec-
tion, we had one of the largest
voter turnouts in the history of
our nation at less than 60%. That
means more than a third of the
country's eligible voters stayed
home. During non-presidential
elections, less than 40% of eli-
gible voters turn out on aver-
age. That leaves a glaringly large
portion of the population com-
pletely outside of the democratic
process that we so cherish. Could
it be possible that people are just
content with how things are and
don't see a need to vote? Accord-
ing to a Pew Research Poll from
last year, only 29% of Americans
are satisfied with the state of the
nation. The average American
is not happy and by not voting is
either apathetic, helpless or pro-
testing. These are systemic prob-
lems. It is time to reconsider and
revamp our democracy.
I remember being confused in
my high school history class when
the topic of the founding fathers
and democracy was broached.
Democracy was a pillar of Ameri-

can freedom and a major rallying
point as the colonialists garnered
support to break free from the
British. When the constitution
was drafted, however, the most
obvious and pure form of democ-
racywas avoided - peopleweren't
directly voting on legislation
themselves or actually participat-
ing directly in the government,
but instead were electing officials
every two to four years to do it for
them. I was told that this was to
protect against the tyranny of the
majority. I thought then, and still
believe, that the whole point of a
democracy is to gauge and enact
the prevalent opinion of a society;
the majority trumps the minority.
This is its most endearing trait.
Why not let the people decide,
instead of officials who by their
very nature have personal inter-
ests and only partially represent
the electorate?
Amid an era with public senti-
ment ripe with cynicism and apa-
thy towards government, there is
no better time to turn to a trusted
remedy: enhanced democracy.
The youth of the Middle East
and North Africa have taken the
first step in coupling technol-
ogy and democracy in the public
consciousness. Everyone seems
to love investing our technologi-
cal prowess towards the creation
of the perfect iPod or the most
realistic video game. What no one
seems to give much attention to is
the idea of improving our democ-
racy with technology. The poten-
tial technological applications
toward strengthening democracy
are boundless if only desire and
ingenuity were present.
Here's an idea: every Ameri-
can over the age of eighteen is
given a polling device. To raise
an issue for state vote, a certain
amount of signatures on a peti-
tion must be reached - these
could be entered, searched and
signed via the device. The elec-
torate of the state would then

directly vote on it through their
voting devices on a designated
day. This proposal is really just a
technologically enhanced version
of the current citizen-sponsored
ballot initiative, nothing too radi-
cal, just a simple improvement.
People would have more agency
over the factors that affect their
lives, and the democratic process
would undoubtedly be improved.
More exciting than anything is
the incredible ease with which
normal citizens could more easily
enact positive change.
Our diluted
government can
be purified.
Unless your last name is
Mubarak or Gaddafi, you are
probably in agreement that
democracy is essential to a free
society. Surely there are obstacles
on the way to achieving a truly
democratic state, but technologi-
cal pragmatism is no longer one of
them. For progress to be made, a
willingness to accept the fact that
our nation does not possess an
inherently perfect form of democ-
racy is essential. Yes, our diluted
democracy works, but we can
always purify it. Our peers in the
Middle East started something
incredible when they decided to
use Facebook for something more
than self-obsession. We should
take note and consider how we
want to use technology to shape
our world. To get this issue onto
the public radar, discussions need
to start now on how we can best
use technology to benefit civics in
our country.

RUDGERS
From Page 1
this April.
"She's a fine choice," Lampe
said. "She obviously has expe-
rience here and she knows the
ropes."
Lampe added that Rudg-
ers has been instrumental to
the University Research Cor-
ridor - a collaborative research
organization established in 2006
between the University of Mich-
igan, Michigan State and Wayne
State University - and that
Rudgers and himself will con-
tinue to work together to further
URC initiatives, as well as other
projects.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman recommended
Rudgers to the board and wrote
in the press release that she is
confident in Rudgers' ability to
fill the new position.
"The University of Michigan
is recognized worldwide," Cole-
man wrote. "This new position
reflects the scope of responsibil-
ity needed in a fast-paced, global
communications environment
that is continually evolving and
changing."
Rudgers left the University
in 2007 to pursue the develop-
ment of strategic communica-
tions and establish her own
consulting firm, Lisa Rudgers &
Associates. Her firm's clientele
includes the University, the Uni-
versity's Dearborn campus and
the URC.
Coleman wrote that she is
glad to welcome Rudgers back to
the University, according to the
release.
"I am delighted that Lisa
has accepted the offer and will
return to lead our communi-
cations enterprise," Coleman
wrote. "Through her knowledge
of the University of Michigan
and previous success here, Lisa
will bring great assets to this
critical role."

CONFERENCE
MCAT changes may influence admissions From Page 2

Exam reviewed by
panel for the first
time in 25 years
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Standardized testingseemsto
be under constant scrutiny over
its ability to predict the compe-
tency of students. The shortcom-
ings of standardized tests like the
Medical College Admission Test
- which has been used to gauge
student proficiency for 83 years
- are being addressed with the
introduction of several changes.
The solutions offered by this
latest round of reforms are rela-
tively new and unprecedented,
according to the Association of
American Medical Colleges web-
site, the company that adminis-
ters the test.
The AAMC panel that
reviewed the current MCAT for
the first time in 25 years suggest-
ed dividing the test into four new
sections, eliminating the writing
sample and including passages
to evaluate skills in ethics, cross-

cultural studies and philosophy.
Concepts from sociology and
psychology will now comprise
the new behavioral and social sci-
ences section, which will focus
more prominently on "the human
and social issues of medicine,"
according to the website.
The changes, developed by
a 22-member committee which
began its review of the MCAT in
2008, are both systematic and
linked to current developments
in medicine that "will empha-
size concepts that future phy-
sicians will need to master to
serve a more diverse population,"
according to the AAMC's website.
The AAMC says they will
likely launch the new exam in
2015, if its Board of Directors
approves it. That uncertainty,
however, has not quelled specula-
tion among admissions officials.
Robert Ruiz, director of
admissions for the University
Medical School, said he thinks
the new test will be interesting
and include a wider range of top-
ics.
"We're thrilled that the test,
we think, will be an improve-
ment," Ruiz said. "Anything that

can be done with the test to be
more inclusive, to capture more
information ... is going to be
good."
Ruiz said he believes the
changes to the MCAT will help
medical schools gain a more
detailed analysis of the students
applyingto their schools.
"I think what you're seeing
is the implementation of tools -
whether it's the MCAT or some
other tools - so that medical
schools have as much data as pos-
sible to make sure they're identi-
fying the kind of individuals (they
want to admit)," Ruiz said.
While Ruiz said that he hopes
the new exam format will allow
them to "be more inclusive" in
the review process, he added that
he could not predict the impacts
of the new exam on the Medical
School's admissions procedures.
This summer, the AAMC said
it will deliberate on its recom-
mendations while continuing to
seek input before presenting its
final recommendations to the
AAMC's Board of Directors in
November. The review commit-
tee will make its decision in Feb-
ruary 2012.

and data engineers working to
fix the global water crisis, said
he believes that publicity is nec-
essary for people to understand
why sustainability matters to
them.
"One of the most important
things when we talk about sus-
tainability is we have to create
a relationship of relevancy," he
said.
Neil Hawkins, Dow Chemical
Company's vice president of sus-
tainability and environment, said
in an interview after the event
that sustainability is an essen-
tial goal because the current rate
of population growth indicates
that the world population will be
about 10 billion by the year 2050.
"There's such a strong growth

in population ... and that puts
an enormous stress and strain
on the ecosystem of the planet,"
Hawkins said. "The increase
in population's driving a global
sustainability challenge for the
planet ... It's going to take a lot of
innovation, a lot of critical think-
ing and a lot of cooperation to
make (solutions) happen."
Hawkins also lauded the Uni-
versity for its work in sustainable
research and business, not only in
Michigan, but also international-
ly through various partnerships.
"(There are) elite world-class
centers of excellence here," he
said. "And you look at the uni-
versities in China that Mary Sue
Coleman and others are part-
nering with. These are the best
minds in the world on both sides.
And bringing that together in this
meeting, it's really a fantastic
opportunity."

Even the devilish Jack

When contemplating Disney,

idea the com-D.n
pany has stowed Disney
in its vaults. Step
one, tell us an enchanting story;
step two, keep milkinguntil there's
nothing left; step three, milk some
more.
This week's "Pirates of the
Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"
is no exception. Straight from
the prolific yet uninspired Jerry
Bruckheimer (who, in case you
didn't know, is the Michael Bay of
cop-themed TV shows and is now
set on ruining pirate films), it's
everything we've come to expect
from the franchise since 2006's
"Dead Man's Chest." The plot is
shallow, the characters are flatter
than flapjacks and the action is too

COURTESY OF DISNEY
Stay tuned for "Jack Sparrow and the Order of the Phoenix."

frequent and hectic to make room
for a good story.
"Pirates" (which is adapted from
Tim Powers' novel, "On Stranger
Tides") finds the eccentric Jack
Sparrow in London searching for
his impersonator. The crook turns
out to be Sparrow's former lover
Angelica (Pendlope Cruz, "Vicky
Cristina Barcelona"). Together,
the two find Angelica's father, the
ruthless pirate Blackbeard (Ian
McShane, "Deadwood"). Beauti-
ful though she may be, Cruz looks
lost in her role, and her acting takes
a deserved second place to Keira
Knightley's career-making per-
formance as Elizabeth in the first
three "Pirates" films.
Without Knightley and Orlando
Bloom to start the film off on solid
footing, the rest of it is a merry-go-
round of pirate clichds, chandelier-
swinging slapstick and of course,
Johnny Depp, who was quite enter-
taining ... the first time around. But
even an industry darling like Depp
can't stave off Sparrow's expiration
date, now long past. Drunken emo
pirate impressions can only amuse
us for so long.

What's to be said of the film's
strengths? Though it's hardly a
compliment, Disney earns a star for
cuttingthe runtime down closer to
two hours. It's hard to imagine how
they could've added another half
hour of nothing without incurring
the ire of an angry movie mob.
The other star is well-earned for
excellent production value, the only
real saving grace. The make-up, the
attention to detail and choreogra-
phy are, per usual, excellent. They
should be, if a production budget
of $250 million has anything to say
about it. But the writers failed to
borrow much of anything from an
abundance of source material, save
for a few character references.
Though the built-in fan base
of the first three "Pirates" films
may ensure the box office success
of "On Stranger Tides", it's clear
that Disney has become its own
worst enemy. Maybe they should
let Pixar take the wheel from here
on out. Originality is always better
than lazy rehashing. If "National
Treasure 3" is any indication, we're
in for a lot more of the same from
Disney Pictures.

Last week shaped television
forever - or at least for next fall -
when the major networks held their
annual upfronts, announcing their
new fall schedules. Here is a spot-
light on the upcoming shows that
matter - either for looking particu-
larly strong or particularly awful.
THE STRONG
NBC's "Awake" - This is shap-
ing up to be best new series in a
long time. Jason Isaacs, perhaps
best known for portraying Lucius
Malfoy in the "Harry Potter" films,
takes the lead role in a series that
is already earning comparisons
to "Inception" for the way it plays
with our conceptions of dreams and
reality. The series follows a cop who
gets into a car accident with his wife
and son in the car. He wakes up into
two different realities: one in which
his son died in the crash, and one
in which his wife died. He goes to
sleep in one reality only to wake
up in the other. But details from
the realities begin to bleed over, as
clues to a case in one reality spawn
new leads in the other, and his two
psychiatrists each attempt to con-
vince him that the other reality is
nothing but a dream. It's a dark,
surreal yet ultimately relatable, tale
of not wanting to let go. This awe-
inspiring new series comes from
the great mind of Kyle Killen, the
creator of last fall's "Lone Star,"
which was also met with critical
acclaim. Hopefully this time, audi-

show. If the series is even close to as
compelling as the trailer, they really
should.
NBC's "Free Agents" - It's
nice to see some smart, dry com-
edy on NBC, and even nicer to see
Hank Azaria being lovably, miser-
able. There's a genuine, pretty sad
story lingering there behind all the
laughs. While it's mostly a work-
place comedy, this one's really about
the characters. This is going to be
one of those shows that, like "Com-
munity," doesn't always have to be
laugh out loud funny, because audi-
ences will be invested in the story
itself. The one bad thing about this
show is that it's getting a bit of an
experimental run on Wednesdays
instead of the prominent Thursday-
night block spot it deserves.
CBS's "Person of Interest"
- Michael Emerson ("Lost") is
enough to make any new series
seem appealing. He plays billion-
aire Mr. Finch, who has a mysteri-
ous list of people about to commit
violent crimes, and hires vigilan-
tes to prevent them from doing so.
His newly hired vigilante is Reese,
played by Jim Caviezel ("The Pris-
oner"), a government agent turned
depressed homeless person. While
the show may not have a particular-
ly exciting or new premise, it does
seem to be a particularly strong
take on the action drama, with
strong performances and compel-
ling mysteries surrounding its main
characters.

Foster the People lights bright 'Torches'

The three Foster
boys excel on new
 effervescent LP
By ELLIOT ALPERN
Daily Arts Writer
The music industry had every
reason to write off the 20-month-
old baby more commonly known
as Foster the People. Prior to
Torches, the band
had just an EP ****
and a mildly pop-
ular song to their Foster the
name - the latter People
being "Pumped
Up Kicks," which Torches
managed to Columbia
bite, scratch and
claw its way up
to number four on the Billboard
Alternative Songs chart. Other
than that, the outfit previously
known as "Foster & the People" (at
least before that pesky ampersand
was dropped) was untried and
untrue, just another indie band

hopeful in the vast musical land-
scape of Los Angeles. However,
with Torches, Foster the People
has emerged from the detritus
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
poised (with a little bit of luck) to
take the independent music scene,
by storm.
Though it is and will likely con-
tinue to be the most successful
track off of the album, "Pumped
Up Kicks" is the black sheep on
Foster the People's first release.
With a pop-oriented chorus and
a laid-back aura, the single is
cool and smooth where the other
tracks are delightfully fidgety. The
opening "Helena Beat" employs a
dangerously dance-inspiring beat
and lively synthesizers, as does
the majority of Torches (pinning
Foster the People somewhere
between Passion Pit and MGMT).
Likewise, "Houdini" is absolutely
contagious in its catchiness, and
proves to be the best track on the
record.
Instead of the common prob-
lems that most first releases run
into - say, lack of material or

general inconsistency - Torches
struggles most with its own innate
weirdness. This isn't necessarily
detrimental; in fact, "I Would Do
Anything For You" is eerily remi-
niscent of an Abba hit on its third
can of Red Bull (seriously, with a
chorus of "Ooh la love, I've fallen
in love"), but it works. However,
"Life on the Nickel" has just a few
too many gimmicks, and comes off
as eclectic rather than inventive.

Blue loses two to Penn State

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
In the grand scheme of things,
the games this past weekend meant
nothing.
Good thing nobody told that to
the Michigan baseball players, who
got a rare chance to celebrate on the
field, follow- PENN STATE 1
ing 5-4 walk- MICHIGAN 0
off win in 11
innings over PENN STATE 4
Penn State on MICHIGAN 5
Friday.
The win PENN STATE 11
was sand- MICHIGAN 8
wiched
between two more frustrating 1-0
and 11-8 losses to conclude the Wol-
verines' disappointing season.
Saturday was Senior Day for
Michigan's lone departing seniors,
fifth-year senior pitcher Matt
Gerbe and injured fifth-year senior
captain Anthony Toth. The Wol-
verines (7-16 Big Ten, 17-37 overall)
honored Gerbe by allowing him to
start just his third career game.
And the righty - who has bat-
tled injuries for much of his career
- didn't disappoint early on.
Through four innings, Gerbe
allowed no runs and just one hit,
striking out a career-high five.
But trailing 2-0 in the fifth
inning, the Nittany Lions (12-12,
32-30) ended Gerbe's day. After
allowing two singles and a walk,
center fielder Sean Deegan - the

conference's leader in homers and
slugging percentage - tied the
game with a two-run double.
Junior pitcher Kevin Vanghe-
luwe came on in relief, allowing a
run-scoring sacrifice-fly, a two-run
homer and a single before being
pulled. By the time freshman hurl-
er Alex Lakatos finally ended the
inning, the Nittany Lions had taken
a 6-2 lead. They took a 9-2 lead into
the eighth, when the Wolverines
made things interesting.
With the bases loaded, fresh-
man right fielder Michael O'Neill's
grounder to second was thrown
away, allowing two Michigan run-
ners to score. The Wolverines
added three more runs off sopho-
more center fielder Patrick Biondi's
single and two ensuing fielder's
choices.
Freshman catcher Cole Martin
- representing the go-ahead run
with the score 9-7 - struck out,
stranding two men on base.
After the Nittany Lions"made it
11-7 in the top of the ninth, Michi-
gan got a run back off an O'Neill
single. Junior left fielder Coley
Crank came up with two on and
two outs, representing the tying
run. But Crank struck out, ending
Michigan's season.
"It was an exciting game," Mich-
igan coach Rich Maloney said. "I
guess what I'm very pleased with is
that, despite the difficult season we
had, the guys never did quit ... It's
that attitude to never quit that's a

good trait for building a team."
On Friday, the Wolverines took
the early lead when O'Neill singled,
later stole third and scored off a
Crank single. Michigan gained
back two runs in the fifth and car-
ried the lead into the eighth, thanks
to stifling pitching from redshirt
sophomore Matt Broder.
Redshirt sophomore pitcher
Tyler Mills came in after fresh-
man hurler Jake Engels loaded the
bases, and gave up two runs on a
walk and wild pitch to tie the game.
Mills escaped major damage by
inducing a bases-loaded groundout.
In the eleventh, O'Neill singled,
Biondi reached on a Penn State
throwing error and Crank was
walked to load the bases.
Junior third baseman John
Lorenz sent a 2-1 pitch into right to
end the game, igniting a celebratory
mob in the infield around Lorenz.
"To come from behind and
see the kids celebrate on the field
- we've had so many of those
throughout the years that I've been
here and in the history of our pro-
gram - but to have a moment like
that in the difficult season, I was
really happy for the guys," Maloney
said.
On Thursday, the Wolverines
wasted a gem from junior pitcher
Brandon Sinnery. The righty went
eight innings, allowing just one
run off four hits, while striking out
seven, but earned the loss as Michi-
gan's bats were muted all night.

Ledby Kin
first Regioi
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Lion Kim had just one thing
between him, a career day and a
NCAA Championship berth. On
the 17th hole of his final round at
the Central Regional on Saturday
- the 53rd hole of the weekend -
Kim was in a sand trap for the first
time all weekend.
But Kim holed out from the
bunker for an eagle, leading the
Michigan golf team to its first-ever
Regional title and propelling the
Wolverines to set a single-round
program regional record of 275
shots. Michigan edged out Illinois
by two shots to claim the top spot
in the 14-team field.
Kim's eagle highlighted his
final-round658- tyingacareerbest
- and gave him a share of the top
score of the weekend. Michigan's
captain posted the second-best
score (205) in Michigan history
for a 54-hole tournament, becom-
ing a co-medalist for the weekend
alongside the Fighting Illini's Luke
Guthrie.
"It was so much fun," Kim said
of his day-long battle with Guthrie.
"He and I knew we were tied for
the lead and we really went after
each other with birdies and eagles
here and there.

putt on 18 to tie me and he made
a 10-footer for birdie to tie me, but
you have to give him a lot of props
for his effort. It was so much fun,
you sometimes almost want it to
end the way it did."
And while it ended just right
for Kim, the tournament didn't
start off nearly as well. Kim's ail-
ing ankle nearly kept him off the
course.
"I did not want to hurt this team
because of me pulling out or being
injured," Kim said. "That was the
last thing I wanted. I told myself to
gut it out. It was painful. I limped
all three front nines before it
warmed up."
Added Michigan coach Andrew
Sapp: "Lion (Kim) leading the way
-for us, hurt and everything, was
just a truly amazing and coura-
geous effort. (His ankle) was hurt-
ing him worse today than it did
yesterday, but I guess it loosened
up and the adrenaline helped him
make it through. For him to just
make it through, and for that mat-
ter even play, and then be the co-
champion, just incredible."
Entering the final day, Kim sat
at sixth on the leaderboard and
Michigan was sitting in third place
behind Alabama and Illinois.
But the Wolverines rode the
hot swings of Kim, junior Matt
Thompson and freshman Joey
Garber - whose 209 tally was
a career best - to a come-from-
behind finish.'
"Wejust tore up the back nine -
it was awesome," Sapp said. "At one
point, I was talking with the Illi-
nois coach on No.12 and they were
just tearing it up and I said to him,
'You are going to run away with
it.' And then low and behold, they
started backing up and we started
making birdies and just kept going
from there."
The program's first regional
title punched Michigan's ticket to
the NCAA Championships for the
second time in three years. The
NCAA Championships will run
May 31-June 6 in Stillwater, Okla.
The Wolverines haven't posted a
national title since back-to-back
championships in 1934 and 1935.
"All five guys really had a great,
great event. When you have four
guys finish in the top 20 and two
guys in the top five, you know you
are going to have a good chance to
win."

Taylor's legacy hits snag in seventh-inning fallout

W Senior pitcher
sets two Michigan
pitching records
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Jordan Taylor kept her eyes
down and bit the top of her blue
No. 7 jersey as she walked past the
entire Kentucky team celebrating a
walk-off win at home plate.
The cold truth became read-
ily apparent for the No. 2 Michigan
softball team in the elimination
game: The senior who got the Wol-
verines to that point had ended it
all.
With a 1-0 lead entering the bot-
tom of the seventh inning, Taylor
allowed a leadoff home run to right
field and then allowed consecutive
walks and a hit batter to load the
bases.
With Michigan's hopes quickly
fading, Taylor struck out one bat-
ter before inducing a game-ending
blooper to .151-hitter Annie Row-
lands that fell just past first base.
"She was not happy, and I'm
sure she was shook up a little bit,"
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins

said. "She got a little tentative and
she pitched a little careful. But I
told the kids, 'Jordan didn't lose the
game for us.' Jordan was outstand-
ing, she pitched her heart out all
weekend.
"If it would've worked, it
would've been just a hell of an
effort."
Taylor was unavailable for com-
ment after the game, but the tears
that mixed with her eye black, as
she hugged her mother and strode
into the clubhouse, spoke volumes.
Taylor weaved a gem for six
innings at Alumni Field on Sun-
day, striking out 10 hitters to stake
Michigan to a 1-0 lead, but her
outing - and her senior season
- unraveled with just three outs
remaining.
The look of shock on her face as
Wildcat pinch runner Macy Allen
crossed home plate to end the game
showed Taylor's disbelief. But she
wasn't alone.
"I wasn't going to believe it until
they scored that run that we weren't
going to go in and get more at-bats,"
junior third baseman Amanda
Chidester said. "I believed Jordan
was going to get through it and
we'd make some plays. I thought a
double-play was going to come, but

(Rowlands) found a little hole."
To Kentucky hurler Rachel Riley,
who was the first of the seventh-
inning walks, Taylor didn't seem to
lose her composure.
"I was expecting her to come
with her A-game, because she's a
great pitcher and I thought she'd
have the confidence to get the next
few outs," Riley said. "I was just
looking for my pitch, and it never
came."
But Taylor faced equally difficult
stretches in both games Saturday -
a 7-6 loss to Kentucky and a 9-8 vic-
tory over Notre Dame.
Taylor threw 428 pitches in less
than two days - allowing 12 runs
over four games - but the 10 con-
secutive balls in the seventh inning
were the dagger.
"I had seen her get rattled (Sat-
urday) with us and Notre Dame -
I could see it in her face and in the
way she'd start throwing her pitch-
es a little crazy," Rowlands said.
"So I do think we did kind of take
advantage her being rattled."
Despite the disappointing fin-
ish, Taylor's weekend cemented
her place in Michigan softball his-
tory by becoming the winningest
pitcher in program history with her
107th victory and passing former

strikeouts with her 1,206th in the
fourth inning against Notre Dame
on Saturday.
But Taylor was still not altogeth-
er pleased with her performance.
"(The record) makes the whole
day a little bit better, I guess," Tay-
lor said after defeating the Fighting
Irish. "But I was not happy with
my performance, so we're going to

Her strikeout reign mounted to
a nearly insurmountable 1,220 total
by the end of the NCAA Ann Arbor
Regional, but arguably Michigan's
best-ever pitcher saw her career
come to a halt with nothing more
than a handful of program records,
two All-American seasons and four
Big Ten championships.
And even for Hutchins, it's hard
to ask for more than that.
