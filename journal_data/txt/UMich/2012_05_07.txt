The epitome of'Whedon-esque'

Amazing 'Avengers'
upholds Nerd-dom

it's about time the adjective
"Whedon-esque" was added to
the English language. You know,
when a work of

drama and roll-
on-the-theater- Disney
floor-and-get-

laughter so perfectly, it makes the
rest of the fare skulk away in their
bloated, Hasbro-sponsored pants.
The Marvel movies leading up to
"The Avengers" all ranged from
good to great, but add two table-

spoons of Joss Whedon and bam
- you get a movie that is amazing,
astonishing, incredible, uncan-
ny, spectacular and every other
superlative ever used as a preface
in a Marvel comic book title.
Here's where Nerd-dom col-
lectively sighs, "Told you so."
They've been preaching the Gos-
pel of Whedon for years, but "The
Avengers" is Joss's long-awaited,
much-deserved coming-out party
for the rest of the world - a soiree
that makes the "Project X" riffraff
look like a neighborhood potluck.
From opening frame to post-
credits sequence, "The Aveng-
ers" glistens with effervescent
entertainment - it's classic stand-
up-and-cheer, holy-shit-did-The
Hulk-just-do-that cinema that
leaves audiences with a grin plas-
tered on their face as they exit the
hall, furiously pulling up Google
Calendar to check when they can
experience the movie again.
The first filmsofsuperhero fran-
chises are always bogged down
by the necessity to tell the origin
story (see: how much better "The

Dark Knight" and "Spider-man 2"
are than their predecessors), but
"The Avengers" takes advantage
of its status as a quasi-sequel even
further. The standalone Mar-
vel movies gave introductions to
not just Captain America (Chris
Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth),
Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.),
The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Nick
Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and all
his S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but also
the film's main villain Loki (Tom
Hiddleston) and the Tesseract,
a blue cube that is the object of
everybody's interest (it's powers
aren't sufficiently explained, but
who gives a shit, it gets the Aveng-
ers to bring the pain).
So "The Avengers" gets to cut
right to the action, with Loki's
theft of the Tesseract and the
assembling of the Avengers - and
it's these opening scenes where
the idea that this movie is going to
be truly remarkable begins to take
root.
In the briefest of vignettes,
the film saves the Black Widow
from irrelevant character-stasis,

unveils Captain America's 21st
century loneliness, shows the
heart behind Tony Stark's caus-
tic facade and gets Bruce Banner
to actually crack a quip, exuding
Whedon's expertise in developing
dynamite characters.
Like the boss he is, Whedon
never loses focus that this is a
team movie - every single Aveng-
er, from Thor to Hawkeye (Jeremy
Renner) gets a dramatic show-
case, spouts uproarious zingers
and goes H.A.M. in a moment that
demands a thunderous ovation.
Whedon's control of this delicate
equilibrium is at center stage dur-
ing the film's sensational final
battle - a flurry of hearty laughs
(unrelenting, in a good way) and
electrifying action set pieces that
culminates in a stunning single
take featuring every one of Earth's
Mightiest Heroes earning their
title. Heaven is a place where you
can watch The Avengers duke it
out with Loki's alien horde in mid-
town Manhattan for eternity.
These days, the phrase
"gamechanger" is thrown around

as casually as the Hulk kicks the
living shit out of Loki and his min-
ions, but that's exactly what "The
Avengers" is for blockbuster cine-
ma. The smashing success of "The
Avengers" shows that Marvel's
massive gamble was an absolute
bonanza and that such elaborate,
multi-layered storytelling is pos-
sible in Hollywood.
More importantly, it shows that
big-budget productions can thrive
outside of the hands of commer-
cial and music video directors (no
hard feelings, Michael Bay). Put-
ting years of planning and hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in the
hands of Joss Whedon, a man with
a single directorial feature to his
name - that had a domestic gross
totaling barely a tenth of the pro-
duction budget for "The Aveng-
ers" - but a body of work worth
billions in quality, proves that stu-
dios can be rewarded with leaps
of faith. Filmmakers like Whedon
may not be able to protect Hol-
lywood from Bay-esque schlock,
but you can be damn sure they'll
avenge it.

'U' Apple Sims host e-Waste event

Event provides free
electronic waste
recycling to public
By ANNA ROZENBERG
ManagingNews Editor
Thousands of cars - and the
occasional biker - made their
way to the last day of the fifth
annual e-Waste Recycling Event
held at Pioneer High School on
Saturday.
Each year, the University's
Office of Campus Sustainabil-

ity partners with Apple Inc. and
Sims Recycling Solutions in Chi-
cago, a company dedicated to
making cost-effective, legal dis-
posal services to the pan-North
American area, according to
their website, to host the event.
Andy Berki, manager of the
Office of Campus Sustainability,
explained that the first two days
of the event are geared toward
businesses and non-profit orga-
nizations, but the third day is
focused on bringing the general
public to Pioneer so consumers
can dispose of their electronic
waste.

"A big ol' television in your
basement can weigh up to 80
pounds and cost $40 to dispose,"
Berki said, citing the e-Waste
event as a way for people to get
rid of products like these for free.
Berki said the e-Waste event is
for the public, and the University
does not dispose of any of its own
material through the event.
"We feel like we want to focus
the efforts and time of these
three days towards the commu-
nity as opposed to stockpiling
everything (the University) gen-
erates in the year," he said.

The institute's stated goal is
to make connections between
the schools within the Univer-
sity with regard to sustainabil-
ity with a focus on education
and research, according to John
Callewaert, director of the inte-
grated assessment program at
the Graham Sustainability Insti-
tute.
He said the collaboration
began about a year ago with a
meeting between the Graham
Sustainability Institute and
Focus: HOPE. After multiple
meetings, site visits and project
proposals, six faculty-lead proj-
ects have been selected to par-
ticipate in the initiative.
According to Callewaert, Each
of the six teams will receive
between $25,000 and $30,000
from the Graham Sustainabil-
ity Institute to spend on mate-
rials, meetings and training. He
said the Institute hopes to have

recommendations and results
to present to the HOPE Village
Initiative within the next 15
months.
Callewaert said he is hopeful
this will be a productive collabo-
ration.
"One of the things that (the
Institute) is really excited about
is that it is wonderful to work
with such a well respected
organization like Focus: HOPE,
who's got a clear vision and plan
for what they want to do, and we
can bring the expertise of fac-
ulty and enthusiasm of students
to help move that forward," he
said.
He added that he hopes the
collaboration of schools will
serve as a model for other sus-
tainability projects in the future.
"What we're hoping is that if
we do this well, this would pres-
ent a really exciting model for
other parts of Detroit and other
communities across the country
that are looking for ways to rede-
velop," he said.
Debbie Fisher, director of the
HOPE Village Initiative, said the
initiative was born out of a dis-
cussion of how to better imple-
ment the organization's goals.

Released at the height of finals,
Gaijin Entertainment's PC port of
"Blades of Time" may have gone
largely unno-
ticed. However,
its particular
brand of mind- Blades of
less hack-and-
slash action Tme
might be exactly PC
what is needed
to cope with the Gaijin
posting of grades
over the next few weeks.
"Blades of Time" follows the
antics of your stereotypical first-
person fantasy game. It is here
Ayumi is a scantily-clad blonde
heroine, travelling through the
dangerous Dragonland in search
of treasure, power and Zero, her
long-lost buddy. Ayumi quickly
learns that she can rewind time,
a la "Prince of Persia," and this
becomes an essential skill when
dealing with hard-to-kill enemies,
invincible-but-easily-fooled nem-
eses and puzzles. Mostly puzzles.
"Blades of Time" is definitely
not a game to be played for story.
Gaijin has put a lot of effort into
placing various collectible jour-
nal pieces that follow different
narratives throughout the areas
- each voiced by a different silly
caricature - as if to apologize to
the player for the nebulous cir-
cumstances surrounding Ayumi's
plight. The game, otherwise, is
extremely linear and the uni-
verse and its intricacies are not
explained well.

Are those palm trees? Is this Hawaii?
Despite feeling like an obvi-
ous console port, gameplay is fun.
Mashing mouse buttons and keys
is about as intense as the game
gets, and that level of cerebral
activity is just sufficient enough
to keep your mind off the various
stressors of real life without really
forcingyou to actuallythink about
doing anything. There are guns,
but among somewhat unfriendly
camera angles, the gimped dam-
age and the fact that the enemies
honestly don't give a damn if
you're shooting at their friends,
the player is better off running
face-first into a mob and trying to
slice, dice, freeze and burn them
to death before getting exploded
into tiny pieces.
There are, unfortunately, a
number of things that make
"Blades of Time" feel like a wast-
ed investment on PC. The fact that
the game can be played with a 360
controller is a clear indicator of its
origins - "Blades of Time" was a
console game and obviously still is

at heart. The way the game reacts
to some of the interactions pos-
sible with mouse-and-keyboard
play causes some seriously infu-
riating camera bugs, and the dif"
ficulty in adjusting the camera
without bouncing your screen
around is another issue in itself.
Mild gameplay
in plot-lacking
'Blades'
Gameplay offers little opportu-
nities for individualized experi-
ences, and the number of available
spells and items makes for per-
sonalizing your character next-
to-impossible. "Blades of Time" is
NOT a roleplaying game, though,
and succeeds in its aim to provide
high-octane combat that's easy on
the eyes and the mind.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Adam Yauch lives on
through his music

The hip-hop group
was the first to top
Billboard 200 in
1986
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily Arts Writer
As soon as I read that Adam
Yauch had died, the first few
beats of "Intergalactic" started
playing in my head, accompanied
not by the usual feeling I get of
wanting to jump and dance, but
instead with disbelief, sadness:
"Intergalactic plan-et-ary
plan-et-tary intergalactic."
Rapper and Beastie Boys
founder Adam Yauch, otherwise
known as MCA, wasn't a gun-
hungry, money-loving wom-
anizer like many of those who
dominate the popular rap/hip-
hop sphere today; Yauch was for
peace, and for art, and for letting
others experience those things,
but not without quirky beats and
quality sampling.
With his death yesterday, the
music and creative generation
lost a member that served as
the constant reminder of what
music and art can achieve. Never
taunting the crowd with their
"hun'eds" or their ladies, Yauch,
Michael Diamond and Adam
Horovitz - who together made
up the Beastie Boys - instead
made music with an air of activ-
ism (re: "(You gotta) fight for
your right (to party)") and was
not about gettinglaid (re: "Here's
a little something for ya"). And,
always, their albums reverber-
ated their home: New York City.
They stayed true Yauch's style
on all of their albums up through
the latest "Hot Sauce Committee
Part Two," which was delayed
two years due to Yauch's battle
with cancer.
Yauch had salivary gland can-
cer for three years. He was 47
years old when he passed away
and I'm not the only one that
knows that he was too young.
Check Twitter and all the lead-
ing new sites; mourning his loss
will undoubtedly come from all
the crowds and lives he influ-
enced.
Yauch formed the Beastie Boys

in 1981 when he was 17 years old.
And while the group stands out
most obviously because they are
three white Jewish rappers, they
proved they could rap as well
as the rest when their first full
album, License to Ill, - released
* in 1986 - was the first hip-hop
album to reach the number one
spot on the Billboard 200. Their
induction into the Rock and Roll
hall of fame last month, which
MCA could not attend because
of his sickness, proved it.
MCA was someone who
cared. Moreover, he was socially
conscious, as exhibited by the
benefit concerts he organized.
Among the slew of them was the
show in 1996 for Tibetan Free:
dom that rivaled Live Aid's and
another after September 11th
where the proceeds were given
to those affected that wouldn't
have otherwise gotten support.
He was an artist. He started
his own film production com-
pany called Oscilloscope Labo-

responsible for Banksy's "Exit

other films. He also directed
some of the Beastie Boys' music
videos - including "Intergalac-
tic" - using the alias Nathanial
Hfrnblowr, but directed the
most recent video for "Make

Multifaceted and passionate
about his work, Yauch was rare.
I think because I respected his
work and his purpose, his death
is particularly sad. The first time
I watched a Beastie Boys video
on TRL, I laughed: They looked
like they were having too much
fun to be serious, to be a real
group. Once I discovered that
they were exactly that - real
(and had several number one
albums) - my admiration grew.
It's hard to think I won't be

ing that he's gone. MCA, Adam,
thanks for doing it right.

Last month, the Univer-
sity was once again the leader in
groundbreaking medical research
with a new study from the School
of Public Health that discovered
a change in Alzheimer's patients'
brain structure.
In a collaborative study that
performed a postmortem analy-
sis on subjects with and without
Alzheimer's, researchers from
nine different University depart-
ments found a change in the epig-
enome - responsible for turning
genes on and off - of Alzheimer's
patients.
Dana Dolinoy, assistant pro-
fessor in the Public Health School
and the study's co-author, spe-
cializes in epigenetics and said
that if the genome is a computer,
the epigenome would be the soft-
ware that tells it what to do.
According to Dolinoy, this
discovery is important because it
allows for research of new ways
to treat or prevent Alzheimer's
disease.
"If a disease is caused by an
epigenetic effect we may be able
to use dietary approaches or
pharmacological treatments to
counteract the negative epigen-
etic effect," Dolinoy said.
She added that this research
is important in helping identify
who will have the disease earlier
than could be done before.
According to Howard Hu,
chair of the department of envi-
ronmental sciences in the Pub-
lic Health School and principal
investigator on the study, changes
in the epigenome can be caused
by environmental factors early in
life, like exposure to toxic chemi-
cals.
Though this study did not
examine specific causes for the
change in epigenome, Hu believes
that exposure to lead could be
an important factor in trigger-
ing the change in the epigenome,
but added that this hypothesis
requires further research.

"Basically, we are now setting
the stage for doing research on
early-life risk factors for chang-
ing the epigenome in a bench-
mark area of the brain that we
have shown is associated with
Alzheimer's later in life," Hu said.
Hu added that the study will
need to be replicated in order to
ensure its validity, but he believes
it made great strides toward
understanding Alzheimer's dis-
ease.
Apart- from the epigenomic
differences found, research-
ers also discovered increased
amounts of the protein TMEM59
in subjects with Alzheimer's.
The found changes in the
epigenome lead to fewer methyl-
ated genes as well as an increase
in the TMEM59 protein, accord-
ing to Dolinoy. She explained that
methylation is a mechanism that
controls the strength of a gene
like a dimmer switch on a light, in
this case decreasing the strength
of TMEM59 in Alzheimer's
patients.

Not exclusively Greek
Hazing is now a problem for many student organizations
n college campuses all across the United States, hazing has tra-
ditionally played an important role in being initiated into Greek
life. Yet hazing has recently become more widespread as student
organizations and sports teams have begun to copy this practice as well.
Ranging from the marching band to the football team, hazing has a prom-
inent place in college life now more than ever before. It not only leads to
death and drunken injuries but also breaks down one's self-confidence and
self-worth. College officials need to enforce anti-hazing policies to ensure
that students from all different groups on campus aren't hazing new mem-
bers in order to consider them a part of their organization, and students
need to be well aware that hazing is not an acceptable practice under any

As stories of overboard and
most likely uncommon hazing
incidents become sensationalized
in the media, it seems that a grow-
ing number of students on campus
are joining the usual mindset of
college administrators in their no
tolerance stance toward hazing.
The University administration
and students alike seem to believe
that meaningful friendships can
be built under comfortable cir-
cumstances and, superficially,
that hazing can appear to be an
unnecessary and time-consuming
practice for busy college students.
While there can be some truth
to that mindset, for me, my most
meaningful and lasting friend-
ships have been forged in stressful
situations, not comfortable ones.
The University of Michigan
defines hazing as "any action
or situation ... which recklessly,
intentionally, or unintentionally
endangers the mental, physical,
or academic health of the student.
This includes, but is not limited to
any situation which:
. Creates a risk of injury to any
individual or group
. Causes discomfort to any indi-
vidual or group
C auses embarrassment to any
individual or group
" Involves harassment of any
individual or group
" Involves degradation of any
individual or group
. Involves humiliation of an
individual or group
I Involves ridicule of an indi-
vidual or group"
These so-called mentally
unhealthy situations banned by
the University are, especially
for men, the best circumstances
under which close friendships can
form. Many of our unpleasant life
experiences are what help build
our greatest friendships. In a 2008
study by University of Maine pro-
fessors, Dr. Elizabeth Allan and
Dr. Mary Madden, it proves that
students actually perceive more
positive outcomes from hazing,
rather than negative. Only three
percent of participants reported
feelinghumiliated or degraded.
My closest friendships in high
school, for example, were forged
through the common struggles we
experienced as members of sports
teams. The University bans put-
ting pledges in "discomforting"
situations, but in my experience,
it is this common discomfort we

experienced as teammates at cold
practices, long workouts and away
games on weekends that made us
such close friends.
The University hazing policy
bans "degradation" and "embar-
rassment," but, as team players,
being publicly scolded by our
coaches was an embarrassing
experience. These embarrass-
ing moments not only taught us
important lessons, but made us
closer as a whole due to our strict
coaching staff. It's a common
tactic of sports coaches, notably
exemplified by Herb Brooks and
his 1980 U.S. Olympic team, to put
their players through extremely
strenuous circumstances in order
to bring the team closer together,
thereby forging friendships in the
process.
Similarly, when I worked as a
lifeguard and at a pizza shop, I
bonded with my fellow employees
by lamenting our job and dealing
with the long hours, rude custom-
ers and low wages.
The incredible friendships that
soldiers form under the stress and
trials of war have been famously
portrayed in culture through
stories of strife, such asaShake-
speare's play "Henry V" and the
HBO mini-series "Band of Broth-
ers." While these examples are
extreme, they illustrate the fact
that life-long friendships are made
through sharing adversity. Even
somethingas simple as marriage is
often strengthened by the shared
responsibilities and hard work of
raising children.
Whether it's the stress due to
a boyfriend or girlfriend, a tough
class, ahard practice, longhours at
a job or being hazed during pledge
term, the closest friendships are
formed through times of struggle,
not times of ease. The stressful cir-
cumstances underwhich friend-
ships are formed are exactly the
circumstances that pledge terms
try to replicate through hazing.
While hazing can, and often
does, go beyond its purpose of
bringing pledges together as
friends, the University of Michi-
gan's zero-tolerance policy for
hazing is nevertheless trying to
restrict an invaluable method of
forming life-long friendships dur-
ing some of our most formative
years.

For the Daily
In the Midwest, kids typically
begin their sports careers on the
field with soccer or Little League
Baseball.
But for Michigan water polo's
junior attacker Kiki Golden,
recently named the CWPA West-
ern Division's Player of the Year,
began her sports career in the
pool.
Golden grew up in the San
Francisco Bay area. She started
playing water polo in the sixth
grade, thanks to some inspiration
from her older brother, Matt, who
also played.
"I thought it was better than
swimming," Golden said.
Her high school career began
at Monte Vista High School, just
north of Sacramento. There, she
played on the varsity team, while
she stayed fit with her local club
team, Diablo Water Polo, in the
offseason.
Michigan coach Matt Anderson
said he recruited Golden because
of her club team.
According to Anderson, he was
thoroughly impressed the first
time he watched her play.
"There were a few other highly
recruitable athletes on her team,"
Anderson said. "(But) I saw what
Kiki could do, and (opposing
recruiters) focused on the other
players on her team.
"Immediately, I set my sights on
going after her."
It was a good decision by Ander-
son, as he acquired an under-the-
radar recruit on a stellar club
team.
Even more impressive was the
San Francisco native's transition
from California to Michigan.
Many people wonder how any-
one could sacrifice the sunny, blue
skies for a state filled with snow
anti unpredictable weather. For
Golden though, the choice was a
matter of change.
"A lot of my friends from my
club team went to (University
of California at) Berkeley, then I
came on a trip (to Michigan)," she
said.

"I came here, fell in love with
the place and wanted to go some-
where different."
The transition from a warm cli-
mate to brisk Michigan weather
was not the only change in Gold-
en's forecast as she arrived in Ann
Arbor her freshman year in the
fall of 2009.
"I'd say that freshman year, I
wasn't quite sure what everything
was all about," Golden said. "It
was difficult to balance school and
water polo."
As many college students have
trouble transitioning from high
school to life at a large university,
Golden learned from her mistakes,
and her teammates and coaching
staff took note.
"Her first year and a half, it was
hard because she tried to get by on
just talent," Anderson said. "She
has matured through her junior
year.
"She focuses on the mental and
emotional aspects as well as tal-
ent."
Golden has transformed from a
young college kid to the Player of
the Year and a leader of the water
polo team.
"She is definitely someone that
everybody looks to in order to set
the pace of the game," Anderson
said. "Players look to her a little
too much sometimes."
Her success this year has led
the team to a third-place finish
at the Eastern Championships, as
Michigan narrowly missed out on
an NCAA Tournament berth.
Golden would never take full
credit for the exceptional season
that the Wolverines were a part of,
though.
"(The Player of the year Award)
showed me how far I've come
since freshman year," she said.
"(Though) I never really think
about those things."
Rather, Golden is looking for-
ward to next season, specifically
another shot at the Eastern Cham-
pionships.
"I think we've developed more
as a team," she said. "We'll be los-
ing fewer seniors, and I'm excited
to see how far we can go next year
and how much we can improve."

circumstance.
On May 2, 13 students were
charged for being involved in the
death of Robert Champion, a drum
major in the Florida A&M Univer-
sity marching band. Champion'
died last November after a long
night of hazing rituals, which cov-
ered his body in cuts and bruises.
According to the Huffington Post,
Champion's attorney Christopher
Chestnut stated, "Ultimately, the
case shows how deeply hazing
is entrenched in the culture at
FAMU." Many people, including
Champion's mother, have publicly
disagreed with the charges, claim-
ing they didn't go far enough.
Hazing needs to be taken seri-
ously and is a real and dangerous
problem across college campuses
today. Not only are Greek life
members partaking in these ritu-
als, but students in other campus
organizations are as well. Campus
officials need to step in to ensure
that anti-hazing policies aren't
being violated and are taken seri-

ously by students. Hazing is illegal
in 44 states, including Michigan,
and strict anti-hazing policies
are in place to promote a safe and
healthy community among Greek
life members and other student
groups on campus. Campus offi-
cials, however, need to see to
it that these policies are being
adhered to in all areas of campus
and enforce them if necessary.
Hazing isn't necessary to have a
"real" undergraduate experience.
Students shouldn't be subjected
to extreme measures simply to
become a part of agroup or organi-
zation. Hazing does not take into
account individuals' past experi-
ences, their threshold for pain or
their tolerance for alcohol. Not
only does it create an extremely
dangerous atmosphere, it also
leads to psychological effects that
can scar students for life.
Hazing is a dehumanizing con-
cept that has been instilled in
college culture across the coun-

try. Many assume it is a practice
reserved for Greek life, and thus
any other organization will not
haze, even if they actually do. But
studies of more than 11,000 stu-
dents have revealed that 74 per-
cent of students on varsity athletic
teams have been hazed, and 56
percent of students in performing
arts organizations claim the same.
Hazing is defined as "subjection to
harassment or ridicule." Students
must realize that this can happen
anywhere.
Hazing is not only dehuman-
izing and destructive, but it could
also lead to feelings of worthless-
ness and crush one's self-confi-
dence. The University must crack
down on its anti-hazing policies
to ensure a safe community for all
groups on campus. As Michigan
students, we need to realize that
subjecting each other to these
horrendous measures is com-
pletely unnecessary and simply
degrading.

Senior attackman Trevor Yealy tallied two goals in the final game of Michigan's inaugural varisity season.
Wolverines lose final game
of inaugural varsity season

By SCOTT FREEDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's lacrosse
team concluded its first season as a
varsity program with a loss to No.
5 North Carolina in Chapel Hill on
Saturday.
Tied at two a mere nine minutes
into the game, the Tar Heels quick-
ly gained control and never looked
back on their way to a 19-5 rout of
the Wolverines.
Michigan hung close to North
Carolina through the first quar-
ter thanks to strong performances
from junior Zachary Dauch and
fifth-year senior Trevor Yealy.
After one period of action, Mich-
igan trailed, 6-3, exhibitingsigns of
life heading into the second.
But the Tar Heels held the
Wolverines scoreless in the sec-
ond quarter, jumping out to a 9-3
lead heading into halftime. Yealy
notched a second goal in the third
quarter, but a seven-goal explosion
by North Carolina left Michigan in
a hole, down 12 goals with only one
period to play.
Not surprisingly, Michigan
found North Carolina's lead to be
insurmountable, as the Wolverines
fell to the Tar Heels with the final
tally standing at 19-5.

Editor's note: *The writer of this
viewpoint has chosen to change
the subject's name due to the sen-
sitive nature of the material.
Dear *Laura,
I am writing you to tell you what
I could not say when I saw you
across the street, on the steps of
the Michigan Union. We crossed
paths during our freshman year of
college, which was 11 years after
our separation. I want to tell you
exactly who I am, considering that
in the past we were both confused
on my meaning to the world - you
said that I was a "nigger," and I
thought that you might be right.
We were nine-years-old and in
the fourth grade. We were on our
way to our elective class when you
asked, "Brittany, do you know that
you are a nigger?" That was a day
I will never forget and I wonder if
you remember it-if at all-for the
same reasons that I do.
When you told me what I meant
to you, I found it more useful to
analyze your motives rather than
your specific message. I went to
bed that night thinking about
what kind of conversation your
parents had with you about my
race. Moreover, I was hurt that
you did not consider how I would
like to be identified. My concern at
nine-years-old isstill the same for
me at the age of 21: "Why was I
not given the opportunity to speak
for myself?"
I wonder, at exactly what age do
children come to understand the
meaning of race? This leads me to
ask, atwhat age do children's inter-
racial friendships become strange?
Is this question different from
thinking about the age at which
some white children are told that
black children are niggers?
Fundamentally, I want to know
at what point in your nine-year-old
life did you begin to doubt I was
your equal?
Since you seemed off-put when
you saw me during our freshman
year of college, I'm interested to
know if the way our friendship
ended affected you as much as it
affected me. I assume that it did,
not only because of your noticeably
distant disposition when I bumped
into you later on campus - face-to-
face - but because you "de-friend-
ed" me on Facebook not long after

you saw me.
I want you to know that your
perception of me at nine-years-old
was notyour fault. At the time, the
deterioration of our friendship was
more reflective of race in America
than it was a representation of
your character.
As a self-identified Italian-
American, what would you do?
I hope you understand that hav-
ing the strength to empathize
and appreciate the experiences of
people with a different race than
your own is important. The world
listens when you speak, but the
world questions if I can. Will you
speak with me so that I, too, can
be heard?
I am asking you to be my ally. I
am currently negotiating my place
in the world. I am searching for a
seat of influence that would impact
the types of questions that race in
our country has left me curious
to understand, and I could benefit
from your bargaining power. So,
although you speak of the glass
ceiling, that same ceiling often
feels concrete to me.
Stand beside me to make the
types of changes that Susan B.
Anthony and Eleanor Roos-
evelt made for you (e.g. the right
to work, vote and co-ed educa-
tion). Let's further the advocacy
work of the former Black Panther,
Kathleen Cleaver, with the right
to access birth control, and that
of First Lady Michelle Obama's
concerning healthy living. These
issues affect all of our lives, and
our nation's future.
I am asking that you reconsider
stereotypes and be open to believ-
ing that my race may be different
from what you think we are, and
what you think we can become. I
am asking you to think critically
about the words that you use and
the decisions that you make - most
of which havecthe potential to affect
the lives of people in the nation you
care the most about: America.
Altogether, I am asking thatcyou
help me provide other girls in our
country with the friendship that
we never had.
Sincerely,
Brittany A. Smith

Watching
Seth Meyers
spew some ADRIENNE
scarily accu- ROBERTS
rate jokes at a
comedy show
the other Friday night made me
realize that we, as a country, are
not terribly self-aware. We get
what we want, and then we hate it
and complain, just like that. Most
of us don't realize that we sound
like whiny, little children.
While this tendency may just
be human nature, it's more pro-
nounced in America because in
politics, we have two options. And
usually, they're quite extreme.
Left or right. A capitalist-conser-
vative or a hippie-liberal. Com-
pletely out of touch or just too cool.
As young people who will be
voting for president in a mere six
months, we want a politician that
can speak to us in a language we
can identify with and discuss
topics we care about. Things
like foreign policy are extremely
important, but they aren't what
we, as college students, deal with
on a daily basis.
When President Obama
appeared on "Late Night with
Jimmy Fallon" and "slow
jammed" the news, it was a
refreshing break from the gener-
alized speeches that we hear on
a frequent basis. It was funny, yet
effective. And it hit home with
college students. Not surpris-
ingly, the Stafford Loan inter-
est rate increase received much
more attention from the press,

BRITTANY SMITH I
An open letter

as young people are more likely
to watch a nighttime program.
Obama's "slow jam" was the third
and fourth most searched item on
Google for days after it aired.
Appealing to a younger genera-
tion is not solely reserved for the
Democratic Party. Mitt Romney
went on "The Late Show with
David Letterman" to recite a "Top
Ten List" in an obvious attempt
to identify with the younger vot-
ing generation and make himself
appear less uptight.
While both candidates have
pandered to the youth vote,
they have criticized each other's
methods as being insincere and
condemning them as desperate
attempts to relate to the younger
voting generation.
But the thing is, while the goal
of comedic endeavors from poli-
ticians is to ultimately persuade
you to vote for them, research
shows that receiving informa-
tion in a humorous manner actu-
ally causes viewers to retain more
information.
So, though it may appear to
be just another campaign strat-
egy, viewers are most likely learn-
ing more than they would when
watching a typical debate, and may
have an easier time remember-
ing it. More viewers will tell their
friends about it in the morning or
post it on Facebook, all because it
is a nontraditional - and funny -
form of presenting news.
It's understandable how sing-
ing about Stafford loans, which
are a major concern for many stu-
dents, may come off as insensitive.
But it may actually be beneficial
to young people who had no con-
cept of the severity and urgency of
the issue before. It's by no means
a funny issue, buta funny delivery
brings about necessary thought
and action.

It's surprising, then, that we
turn around and criticize these
same actions that draw attention
to an issue and make it seem as
though politicians are dumbing
them down for our demograph-
ic. The complexity of the issue
remains the same - what changes
is the style in which that message
is delivered.
We sound like
whiny, little
children.
If we desire politicians that
speak to us on an understandable
and relatable level, then we should
appreciate the fact that humor is
an effective manner to get people
to listen, and hopefully care.
Once we start calling presidents
"too cool" when they attempt to
relate to a younger generation, we
risk keeping many voters in the
dark.
With almost every new presi-
dent, we complain that they are
out of touch and have forgotten
about whatthe youth vote needs to
make an informed decision. If we
continue to criticize presidential
nominees Barack Obama and Mitt
Romney, we should expect that
their concern over issues impor-
tant to us would dwindle.
As a country, we will most like-
ly continueto be the annoying kids
in the backseat on a long drive. A
line needs to be drawn, however,
between constructive criticism
and just plain bitching.

BASEBALL
From Page IA
Biondi and O'Neill. The two out-
fielders each had three hits and
two RBIs. The duo played a pivotal
role in the six-run inning, as they
each knocked in runs. Biondi also
recorded three stolen bases in the
matchup.
Sophomore right-hander Alex
Lakatos pitched well in his first
start of the season. In six innings of
work, Lakatos allowed four hits and

two earned runs while fanning four
hatters.
OnFriday night, senior right-
hander Brandon Sinnery turned in
a dominating performance, throw-
ing a complete-game shutout - his
first of the season and second of his
career. Mixing his pitches, he kept
the Hawkeyes (7-11, 19-24) off-bal-
ance all game, limiting them to six
hits. He retired nine straight bat-
ters between the fourth and sixth
innings. The only moment when
Sinnery's shutout appeared to be
in jeopardy was near the end of the

game. Iowa's shortstop Kasey Car-
liog led off the ninth inning with
a walk, which was followed by left
fielder Phil Keppler's lone single of
the contest. After retiring the next
two batters, he allowed another
Hawkeye to reach base on a fielder's
choice, loading the bases. Display-
ing a calm demeanor on the mound,
Sinnery struck out catcher Dan
Sheppard to end the game. He fin-
ished with eight strikeouts, while
walking just one batter.
"Brandon Sinnery was outstand-
ing," Maloney said. "That game was

just one of those games where just
everythingwas clicking."
On offense, O'Neill and senior
catcher Coley Crank led the Wol-
verines. O'Neill, who missed the
last15games due to aleft-hand inju-
ry, seemed to be the spark plug that
Michigan hadbeen missing overthe
past month. He singled in his first
at-bat, stole second base and gave
the Wolverines their first run when
he scored on first baseman Brett
Winger's single.
"The first at-bat was the biggest
at-bat for me," O'Neill said. "I told

everyone that I talked to that the
first at-bat - it felt like it was open-
ing night again. I had some jitters
and I just wanted to get that hit out
of the way."
In his first game in a month, the
right-fielder went 3-for-5, scoring
three runs and driving in another.
Crank, who has been ripping the
cover off the ball, went 3-for-3 with
two home runs and five RBIs.
"We didn't get the sweep that
we were hoping for, but it took a lot
of pressure off of us and we played
really well," O'Neill said.

Wolverines rebound in sweep of Wisconsin

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
Just like Journey, the Michigan
softball team won't stop believing.
"To be our best, we need to
believe," said Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins. "If you always believe
you can win
the game, you MICHIGAN 5
got to always WISCONSIN 1
believe in
yourself and MICHIGAN 7
your team- WISCONSIN 5
mates, (and) I
thought this weekend we made a lot
of great strides in believing in each
other. I thought it was a great week-
end for us."
Despite Sunday's game cancella-
tion due to rain, that great weekend
for Hutchins included a sweep of
Wisconsin (12-8 BigTen, 33-17over-
all) - winning the doubleheader,
5-1, 7-5 - a grand slam, and a 4-for-
5 performance from her senior star
Amanda Chidester.
The 23rd-ranked Wolverines
(15-5, 36-15) certainly needed the
wins to stay atop the Big Ten stand-
ings after they dropped four of the
past six games to mediocre confer-
ence opponents. With the two wins,
Michigan now owns a two-and-
a-half game lead on Iowa heading

into the final Big Ten series against
Purdue.
A lack of offensive production
had plagued the Wolverines in their
past series, but the squad had little
trouble at the plate this weekend.
Michigan tallied just five hits in the
first contest, but bounced back the
second game and put the ball in play
14 times.
The one hit that stood out for
the Wolverines, though, came from
junior second baseman Ashley Lane
in the firstgame.
With an early 1-0 lead stemming
from an RBI single from Chidester,
Michigan loaded the bases with one
out. Lane stepped up to the plate,
prepared to work her at-bat and
knock in a run or two. Recognizing
the difference between Wiscon-
sin sophomore pitcher Cassandra
Darrah's fastballs and change-ups,
Lane patiently waited for the right
pitch.
Then she ripped one out of the
park.
Lane's grand slam was the third
of the season for the Wolverines,
and the five-run third inningproved
to be the game-winner for the team.
Though Hutchins was certainly
pleased with Lane's headlining
effort, she knows it takes more than
one player to produce results.

"We kept getting on base,"
Hutchins said. "We put pressure on
their pitching and pressure defen-
sively and, of course, Ashley got the
big hit by putting it over the fence.
"Our kids have been working
hard and I give them credit for that.
They had some ups and downs, but
bottom line is hitting is a tough
thing to do so you just got to work
through the mental game with it
and tryto stay positive."
Saturday's second game featured
much more offense, as Michigan
connected bat with ball 14 times
while its first three batters - senior
center fielder Bree Evans, sopho-
more left-fielder Nicole Sapping-
field and Chidester - contributed
10 of the 14 hits in the game.
The Wolverines got an early 2-0
lead in the first inning on an error
and an RBI single from freshman
designated player Haylie Wagner.
The Badgers responded with a four-
run third inning, but Michigan tal-
lied a single run in both the fourth
and fifth innings, and two more in
the seventh to give the Wolverines
the permanent lead.
And it's not just Michigan's
offense that's carrying the team.
In the circle, Wagner picked
up her 26th and 27th wins of the
season, completing the full seven

4.2 innings in relief in the second
game.
Wagner has been the ace for
Michigan all season and currently
leads the Big Ten in wins, ERA and
runs allowed. Her stellar perfor-
mance this weekend comes at no
surprise, but Hutchins believes she
can still improve.
"Haley has done a fantastic job
for us and more than anything we
want her to trust (pitching coach
Jennifer Brundadge) and the pitch
calls," Hutchins said. "Trust her-
self, do the best she can (and)

not put more on herself than she
already does."
With both the offense and pitch-
ing finally in sync, the Wolverines
will head into the final week of the
regular season on a high.
"For us to have success we
need everybody to do their part,"
Hutchins said. "We need the
offense to produce some runs, we
need our defense to pick the ball up
and if we can get people doing their
part like you saw yesterday, we can
see good results."
But for now, Hutchins just wants
the team to believe.

The Michigan Daily: How did SC: It's pretty intense right now.

I'm coming off a (bicep) injury and
it's just pretty hectic. As of right
now, Mondays and Wednesdays we
have two-a-days practices, so we
work out in the morning from 9:00
to 10:00. Then I alsogoto the weight
room Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays from 10:00 to 11:00. Then
right after that, Monday through
Friday, I have to go to the training
room and do rehab and therapy on
my arm, my bicep and shoulder, and
so that usually takes an hour or an
hour and a half. Basically by the
time I'm done with that, I have to
go straight back to the gym at 1:00
p.m. and do an afternoon workout,
which takes anywhere from two to
four hours. So it's basically about
nonstop from 9:00 a.m. to4:00 p.m.
TMD: Were you or your parents
born or raised in Bangladesh? What
kind of personal connection do you

have to the country?
SC: Both my parents and my
older sister were born in Bangla-
desh, and Iand my younger brother
were born in Florida. My dad, he is
a permanent citizen of the United
States on a green card and my mom
has a U.S. citizenship. So through
my father, I was able to get dual
citizenship, being a U.S. citizen and
a Bangladesh citizen. So through
him, I was able to get the ball roll-
ing, and that took around a year and
a half to two year process just to get
dual citizenship, and I started doing
that back in 2010.
TMD: You didn't get the chance
to compete much this season due to
your recent injury, (so) do you feel
prepared for something as big as the
Olympic Games?
SC: I think the biggest boost of
confidence and the best thing that

made my gymnastics even better
was competing at the World Cham-
pionships and competing at the
South Central Asian Gymnastics
Championships back in December
- those two meets alone definitely
changed my attitude and behavior
in how I compete and how I train.
(In December), I found some suc-
cess and won some medals and it's
definitely helped me become a bet-
ter gymnast and I became more
confident. ... I'm hoping to build off
of that in a lot of mock meet prepa-
ration - we'll put it ina competition
format and competition setting and
try to emulate as much as you can.
But the biggest thing in my mind is
(that) I'm going to go compete out
there like it's just another meet. If
I compete out there and think, "oh
man, it's the Olympics," then the
nerves will probably get to me.
