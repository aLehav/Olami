City amends OWI
to operating while
visually impaired,
sentencing July 14
By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
Redshirt junior offensive line-
man Graham Glasgow appeared in
Ann Arbor District Court Monday
for an operating while intoxicated
charge and pled guilty to the lesser
charge of operating while visually
impaired.
Glasgow was arraigned June
2 and plead not guilty to the OWI
charge from a March 15 incident.
The city amended the charge Mon-
day to operating while visually
impaired, a misdemeanor punish-
able by up to 93 days in jail and a
fine of up to $350. Glasgow will be
sentenced July 14 at 10 a.m.
Judge Joseph Burke presid-
ed over the hearing and asked
Glasgow for details about the night
of March 15, when he was pulled
over by Ann Arbor police officer
Patrick Maguire. Maguire pulled
over Glasgow's Chevrolet Subur-
ban when he noticed that there
was a passenger hanging out the
window shouting at pedestrians,
according to the police report.
At the hearing, Glasgow con-
firmed most of the details - the
only exception being the amount
he had to drink. According to the

police report, Glasgow told police
that night he had consumed five
light beers since about 3 p.m. In
court Monday, Glasgow revised
that estimate to 10 to 12 beers. He
reaffirmed that he started at 4 p.m.
at his house, then later took a nap
and drove to New York Pizza Depot
around 9 p.m.
"I was at my house. I started
probably sometime around 4,"
Glasgow told the judge. "I had -
I'm not quite sure how much - 10
to 12 would probably be my rough
estimate."
Glasgow's blood-alcohol con-
centration was .11 on the spot and
.13 at the police station later.
Glasgow's attorney, John A.
Shea, asked that Glasgow be able
to go home to Illinois to visit his
parents from Wednesday through
Monday during a break in foot-
ball training. The judge originally
adjourned the pretrial hearing
from June 2 on the condition that
Glasgow not leave the state or drink
alcohol.
The judge allowed Glasgow to
go home Wednesday but upheld
the condition that he not drink
alcohol.
"You understand that no alco-
hol means no alcohol," Burke said,
"even if your family is having alco-
hol."
The judge released Glasgow on
a $1,000 personal-recognizance
bond. The Aurora, Illinois native
has been suspended for the team's
season opener Aug. 30 against
Appalachian State.

Nation's first female
delegate discusses
experience in
international politics
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
The Center for the Education
of Women hosted the Ambas-
sador of Botswana to the United
States, Tebelelo Mazile Seretse,
on Wednesday to facilitate a more
international focus in the depart-
ment.
Seretse, who became ambassa-
dor in February 2011, is Botswana's
first female ambassador. Prior to
her current position, she served in

Her Excellency Tebelelo Mazile Seretse, the Botswana ambassador to the US, speaks about her home country, democracy,
and the power of women at Hatcher Graduate Library Wednesday.
B otswana ambassador
talks relations overseas

Botswana's Parliamentary cabinets
from 1999 to 2004, holding vari-
ous positions including Minister
of Trade and Industry, Minister of
Wildlife and Tourism and Minister
of Works, Transport, and Commu-
nication.
During her time on Cabinet, she
successfully facilitated stronger
relations with the United States as
she negotiated a partnership agree-
ment with Washington to establish
an International Law Enforcement
Academy in Botswana. Addition-
ally, Seretse pushed for Botswana's
inclusion in the Africa Growth
Opportunity Act to increase trade
with the United States.
In addition to legislature, Ser-
etse also has experience in the pri-
vate sector as an entrepreneur and
director of her family's business,

Diragake Ltd, an oil company in
Botswana.
In her address, Seretse said
because she has experience in
both the public and private sec-
tors, she believes there are higher
expectations of her as ambassador.
She added that such expectations
reflect the success of her nation
in the past decades since it gained
independence from the United
Kingdom.
Seretse primarily emphasized
the heterogeneity within Africa
and criticized many Americans'
conflicting tendency to refer to the
continent as one would to a coun-
try.

Partnership includes
four schools, allows
for connectivity and
collaboration
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
In the 19th century, the stan-
dard gauge rail, which set the
standard width of rail tracks in
the United States and other coun-
tries, allowed an unparalleled
level of cooperation between the
railway companies, engineers and
businesses. Before the implemen-
tation, trains could only travel
as far as their company had laid
track. Now, they had the oppor-
tunity to travel across the coun-
try on tracks operated by several
companies - all working to stan-
dardize rail construction in the
industry.
Currently, research universi-
ties face similar difficulties on a
digital front. As data is produced
at an incredible rate and dis-
charged into databases, they face
the challenge of making sure it is
stored, protected and utilized in
the best way possible.
To address that, the University
announced last week it would join
the Unizin consortium, a partner-
ship between the University and
three other institutions: Indi-
ana University, Colorado State
University and the University of
Florida.
Unizin's mission is "to support

faculty and universities by ensur-
ing that universities and their fac-
ulty stay in control of the content,
data, relationships, and reputa-
tions that (they) create," accord-
ing to their website.
The consortium will allow
greater connectivity between
data at these institutions. Much
like the standard gauge rail, it
will-set the rules by which data is
collected and distributed among
research scientists, professors,
students and the general public.
Information Prof. James Hil-
ton, dean of the University librar-
ies, led the movement to get the
University involved in the part-
nership.
"(Unizin) is about leveraging
open standards to make sure con-
tent and data can flow between
tools and systems, rather than
remaining locked up inside a sin-
gle tool," Hilton said. "It's about
tiltingthe table in favor ofinterop-
erability and University control."
For a practical example, Hilton
said online practice quizzes, like
those currently offered on CTools,
could be adapted to better suit the
needs of students and instructors.
Rather than just simply having
professors assign problems and
receive scores, the data could be
used to improve course curricu-
lum.
"There's data in there that
would tell us - tell you - the kind
of problems that you're struggling
with and the kind of problems that
you're not," Hilton said. "Right
now, all that stays very isolated."

From Page 1
International Affairs at the Uni-
versity of Michigan-Dearborn,
travelled to Botswana as a Ful-
bright scholar in 2004. She said
during her yearlong stay in the
country, she gained a new appre-
ciation for the diversity present
within the country, as well as a
heightened awareness of how indi-
vidual actions can lead to change
internationally.
"Whatever we do in the States
or within our own departments,
it impacts everyone and this is a
global community," Porter said.
"We may not see the impact, but
it's a rippling effect."
During the speech, Seretse
highlighted both Botswana's
strengths and some of its challeng-
es. Botswana currently stands as
the world's number one producer
of global diamonds, and also has a
strong tourism sector. Seretse even
called Botswana "more peaceful
than the United States," and said
policeman don't need to carry
guns.
However, Seretse also addressed
gender-based violence in the coun-
try, as well as the issues faced by
women in all nations.
"I never want any woman to
put herself down," she said after
speaking about the lack of appre-
ciation for the work that women do
as housewives.

CEW Director, Gloria Thomas,
said by promoting her own coun-
try while still acknowledging the
challenges that remain, Seretse is
doing her job as ambassador.
"Yes, there are challenges, and
she talked about violence against
women as one of them, but there's
a lot going on that's going well,"
Thomas added.
Olayinka Davids, who runs an
NGO in Nigeria that promotes
the success of women, brought a
degree of urgency to the issue of
gender-based violence as she asked
the audience to pray for the girls
abducted by Boko Haram.
"Because of the incident hap-
pening in my country - the miss-
ing girls - I needed to come out, to
appeal, for all the others to join us
in praying," Davids said.
Seretse referenced Rwanda
as another African nation who
faced intense violence and geno-
cide, but still persevered on equal
rights issues. In spite of its violent
past, the country has progressed
in terms of gender equality in
politics, and she said it's the world
leader in the number of women
holding political office.
"Sometimes when I look at all
the good that Rwanda is doing
following the genocide, I think it
is because they have women (in
political office)," Seretse said. "We
need to move away from just talk-
ing about democracy - we need to
talk about participation in democ-
racy."

City Council debates
park in Liberty Plaza

Concerns over
crime could impede
development
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Parks and recreation is serious
business - and not just according
to Leslie Knope.
Monday night, the Ann Arbor
City Council opted out of a vote
on a resolution to improve Liberty
Plaza, and instead referred it to
the Parks Advisory Commission
for review and suggestions.
Liberty Plaza's central location
at the corner of East Liberty and
Division in the city's downtown
district has made its use a hotly
debated issue by city council in
recent months.
Monday night's resolution,
sponsored by Councilmember
Christopher Taylor (D--Ward 3),
would allocate $23,577 from the
parks budget in order to improve
the area.
Taylor said the resolution
would allow a wide range of
appropriate stakeholders to
engage in creating a downtown
park that is "vibrant and green."
Although Taylor did concede
that many citizens wanted a
downtown park other than Lib-
erty Plaza, he noted that Liberty
Plaza is more readily available to
make improvements.
"Liberty Plaza is a park that we
(already) have," Taylor said.
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) said he did
not know if the suggested fund-
ing would be sufficient to meet
the goals of the resolution for out
of concern over the city's lack of
park planners; currently, the city
only has one.
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) said she did not know
if the funds would be enough to
secure the goals, adding that she
would rather have the PAC's input
on the project.
"It's all the public outreach
that is at issue that will get us to
the goal of how we take a really
pleasant area with bushes and
trees and make ita really pleasant,
safe area with bushes and trees,"
Briere said. "I would not object to
postponing this to refer it to PAC."
Kunselman also sarcastically
noted that Liberty Plaza is only

recently becoming a priority over
the city's 157 other parks.
"We have one park planner,
and we have 157 parks," Kunsel-
man said. "This one has suddenly
become the priority."
One of the main concerns with
the proposed park's location in
Liberty Plaza is that citizens -
often the homeless - loiter in the
area, which sometimes leads to
disruptive behavior.
The plaza is also often associ-
ated with drug and alcohol use as
well as violent acts; most recently,
a man was accused of using a box
cutter to slice the face of another
man in the plaza during an argu-
ment over alcohol May 31.
Mayor John Hieftje said he
believes many of these problems
can be fixed by simply redesign-
ing Liberty Plaza.
"I don't want to... have to sta-
tion police officers full-time at
a park," Hieftje said. "If we can
fix this issue through re-design,
that's what we should do."
How exactly the area would be
redesigned in order to alleviate
these issues remained unclear, but
one suggestion made by Taylor
was to remove the seating areas
in the plaza, which he mentioned
the University did when they had
similar problems near the corner
of State Street and North Univer-
sity Avenue.
Kunselman suggested using
the University Landscape Archi-
tecture students and faculty to
help with the Liberty Park proj-
ect, but Hieftje said a plan to coor-
dinate with the department was
already in place.
In addition to debating the
issues surrounding Liberty Plaza,
City Council also voted to approve
the site plan for an 88,570 square-
foot hotel on West Huron between
Main and Ashley Streets.
The plan, brought to the coun-
cil by First Martin, proposes a
six-story building, in which the
first floor would be used for retail
and the upper five stories for hotel
space.
Finally, council approved a
$75,000 agreement with Gre-
enway Collaborative, Inc. to aid
the Pedestrian Safety and Access
Taskforce in their study of pedes-
trian safety in the city.
The taskforce is currently
working to analyze and mend
the city's walkways and improve
other aspects of pedestrian safety.

All-American Ferli~c lone scorer for men's track

By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
The Michigan men's track and
field team hasn't had the best sea-
son in its 103-year history, by any
account.
But it didn't come without its
bright spots. Redshirt sophomore
Mason Ferlic made sure of that.
Ferlic capped off the season
with a fourth-place finish in the
3,000-meter steeplechase, earn-
ing first-team All-American honors
and leading the team to tie for 44th
place with his five points.
Ferlic's 2013 season ended with
a second-team All-American finish
but also a bit of unfinished busi-
ness. The first-year steeplechase
athlete was the first runner left out
of the finals, finishing13th.

Things got out hard, the two guys
got out front and it was a good race
from the gun. There wasn't really
much jostling or drama."
Though Ferlic hoped to pass
Hesselbjerg and finish in third,
coach Jerry Clayton was optimistic
about the future for the All-Amer-
ican.
"As he progresses, his goal has
got to be to try to challenge to win
a national title," he said. "If he runs
fast enough, he'll have an oppor-
tunity that's post-collegiate. But
those things will be determined
here in the next two years on how
he focuses in."
The Wolverines took two more

athletes to Eugene, Oregon for the
championships - redshirt sopho-
more Derek Sievers and redshirt
junior Morsi Rayyan.
Sievers threw a personal record
at the Big Ten Championships to
finish seventh and shattered that
mark by almost two feet at the East
Region Preliminaries to qualify for
the NCAA Championships.
He fell short of his personal
record by three inches in Eugene,
but finished 16th and earned sec-
ond-team All-American honors to
cap a tremendous year of improve-
ment under Clayton.
"What you're tryingto do is keep
the rhythm and timing of where
he's at and maintain that," Clayton
said. "Normally, with peaking, you
can maintain those for a 4-6 week
period."
Rayyan finished 18th in 30:17.87
in the 10,000-meter run to com-
plete a long championship season.

The Schefters: Remembering the year's best

Thursday, June 19, 2014

Town-gown relationship major focus of mayoral forum

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
It was the best of years and the
worst of years for Michigan ath-
letics.
A season that began with wom-
en's soccer on Aug. 23, 2013 and
ended with men's and women's
track on June 14, 2014 was full of
both disappointment and joy.
Regardless, the 2013-14 sea-
son was like every one before it:
unforgettable, spectacular and
heartbreaking.
The Daily's awards, named
after ESPN analyst Adam Scheft-
er, honor the best of Michigan
athletics in the past season.
Schefter was Managing Sports
Editor and football beat writer for
the Daily in the late 1980s and is
one of the Daily's most esteemed
alumni.
The only rule: An athlete or
team cannot win more than one
category, ensuring it's fair game
to any athlete from any sport.
Game of the Year: Michigan
Football's loss vs. Ohio State
Yes, it ended as a loss, but "The
Game" was tense and dramatic
right until the very last second.
It was the best rivalry in col-
lege football living up the hype
that surrounds it. The Buckeyes
entered undefeated with a chance
at a National Championship
Game berth on the line, and the
Wolverines came in reeling with
questions about the coaching
staff looming.
There were punches thrown
and middle fingers raised, as

both teams traded touchdowns
early. And even when Ohio State
took the lead in the third quarter,
Michigan fought back, marching
down the field in the final seconds
of the fourth quarter.
Trailing 42-41, with quarter-
back Devin Gardner playing on
a broken foot, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke opted to go for the
two-point conversion instead of
kick the extra point.
Gardner's pass was intercept-
ed, and the game over, but for a
moment, 110,000-plus fans forgot
about the season at hand and held
their breath.
Coach of the Year: Mike
McGuire, Women's Cross
Country
Mike McGuire has quietly pro-
duced one of the best teams on
this campus. Not just this year,
but in the past decade.
This year, he led the Michigan
women's cross country team to a
fourth-place finish at the NCAA
Championships. The Wolverines
finished runner-up at the Big Ten
Championships and first at the
Great Lakes Regional, led by Finn.
The results speak to McGuire's
continued strength at recruit-
ing, bringing athletes from the
state and around the nation away
from schools on the east and west
coasts and to Ann Arbor.
In the last decade, he has led
his team to five top-six finishes
and three straight regional titles
and has been named Great Lakes
Coach of the Year eight times.
This year, he received the honor
again.

Female Athlete of the Year:
Sierra Romero, Softball
The Michigan softball team
has always had a strong cast of
players, but few have been as
important as Sierra Romero has
been.
This year, the sophomore
standout was a first team All-
American, the Big Ten Player of
the Year and one of three finalists
for National Player of the Year.
She improved on her eye-pop-
ping numbers from last year by
hitting .491 with 18 home runs
and 72 RBI - even more impres-
sive when you consider she was
walked 66 times.
Male Athlete of the Year:
Sam Mikulak, Men's Gymnas-
tics
Any number of athletes could
have grabbed this award, but then
none of those athletes have seven
individual national champion-
ships to their name, let alone two
team national titles.
He won the all-around compe-
tition at the national champion-
ships this year, even with a fall
on the high bars that dropped his
score down nearly five points.
Mikulak completed his illus-
trious college career with first
place on the parallel bars for the
seventh title, which puts him in
a three-way tie for the most all-
time. But his presence was notice-
able as Michigan produced higher
team scores with the Olympian in
the lineup.

nn Arbor citizen? One of these priorities, she
nembers of the same party, added, will be to create a more

open and cooperative relation-
ship between the University and
the city. Instead of asking for
measures such as the controver-
sial payment in lieu of taxes pro-
gram, which has been brought up
by city officials several times as
a solution to the tax revenue the
city loses every time the Univer-
sity buys property and it becomes
tax exempt, Petersen said the city
needed to create a dialogue with
the University to address these
kinds of issues.
Other candidates leaned more
towards a focus on representing
the non-University portions of the
city and prioritizing the needs of
local, voting citizens, emphasiz-
ing a different kind of cooperation
from the University.
"We certainly need to have a
Board of Regents that is cognizant
that if they keep growing and buy-
ing Ann Arbor city property, they
are goingto kill the goose that laid
the golden egg because all of these
amenities downtown are going
to be nothing but a student food
court," Kunselman said.
Taylor encouraged this same
sort of education and awareness
from the University.
"They (the University) are not
evil," he said. "They just don't
understand."
Candidates also debated the
importance of prioritizing either
the downtown area, or its sur-
rounding neighborhoods.
While Briere argued that
improvements downtown will
benefit neighborhoods and
therefore should be the prior-
ity, Kunselman preferred a more
infrastructure focused approach,
providing safe, well maintained
neighborhoods and roads first
before funding downtown needs.
Petersen and Taylor remained
more neutral in their stance
on either pro downtown or pro

neighborhood, emphasizing the
need to work with both groups,
instead of being in favor of one or
the other.
The need for affordable hous-
ing, a concern City Council has
discussed for years and which
continues to be an unsolved prob-
lem in the city, proved to be one of
the most differentiating issues of
the morning, eliciting multiple
different stances from candi-
dates.
Briere argued that Council
needs to reach out to other enti-
ties in order to fund workforce
housing to achieve what she
believes is a necessary goal while
not taking money away from
roads, parks, police, and other
necessities.
In contrast, Kunselman said
as mayor, he would focus on the
Ann Arbor Housing Commission,
maintaining those residences and
attempting to create more, if pos-
sible, in lower-cost real estate
areas ?:stead of on a downtown

location. Petersen also empha-
sized the need to make afford-
able housing a priority, and said
as mayor she hoped to de-mystify
the idea of affordable housing
near other neighborhoods.
Taylor said part of the afford-
able housing problem stems from
students, and proposed incentiv-
izing onvestors to build affordable
housing downtown instead of
student housing.
Candidates also discussed
inspiring commercial develop-
ment and the possible re-zoning
of Main St., better non-motorized
transportation, the City Council's
relationship with the Downtown
Development Authority, and how
to further utilize the University
as a resource to the city's growth
and development.
The Ann Arbor Democratic
mayoral primary will be held
Aug. 5. Five additional debates
between candidates are sched-
uled within the next few weeks.

Sam Mikulak won an all-around national title and led Michigan to the team title.

Team of the Year: Michigan
Men's Gymnastics
As the only program to win
a national championship, the
Michigan men's gymnastics team
has earned this honor.
Led by Mikulak, the Wolver-
ines won their second straight
title - the first Michigan team to
win back-to-back titles since the
trampoline team did it in 1976-77
- in dominant fashion. They led
from the first round all the way to
the sixth in front of a home crowd
that energized all of Crisler Cen-
ter.
Michigan never lost a dual
meet this season and finished
first in every scored meet. Con-
sider that Michigan is in arguably
the hardest conference for men's
gymnastics, and the feat looks
even more impressive.
Perhaps it's time Michigan be
referred to a "gymnastics school."
Career Achievement Award:
Mac Bennett, Ice Hockey
Mac Bennett will probably tell
you he didn't expect his last two
years to end without an appear-
ance in the NCAA Tournament,
not after 22 straight years of qual-

ifying asa team.
But the senior defenseman
was the face of the Michigan
hockey team, in moments when
it excelled and moments when it
faltered. He remained the anchor
of the Wolverines' defense, even
when he was injured.
In 2012-13, Bennett injured
his back, missing several weeks,
and last season he sat out for four
games with a punctured lung. But
he was at every practice watch-
ing and learning even when he
couldn't skate.
This award isn't necessarily
given to the best athlete. Bennett
knows other defenseman before
and after were better players, but
it's given to the athlete who best
embodies the team over his four
years.
He made the right plays, even
if they didn't show up on the
scoresheet, finishing his career
with 14 goals, 51 assists and a
plus-40 mark on the ice. But as
a two-time captain, Bennett also
made everyone else around him
better, setting up goals or mini-
mizing mistakes.
And he was rewarded when he

diens this April, where he'll take.

Potentially, platforms like
Unizin could also protect property
rights. The system ensures profes-
sors have control over who gains
access to their research, and that
they receive due credit for their
work.
The partnership also paves the
way for advancements in digital
learningatthe University,delivered
via massive open online courses, or

MOOCs. The University currently
offers 12 of these courses on Cours-
era, an online platform that allows
individuals from around the world
to access University content and
instruction for free.
While Unizin is not designed as
a platform to host online courses,
Business Prof. Gautam Kaul said it
provides "the ecosystem needed for
us to flourish in that environment."
Kaul highlighted the importance
of being on campus for students, so
theycouldinteract withfaculty and
gain hands on experience in their

respective fields. However, he said
the current methods of education
should be carefully reconsidered
to improve learning efficiency and
to get students to campus with
greater knowledge, prior to ever
stepping in a classroom.
"A lot of the stuff that we do in
residential education doesn't need
to happen (in residence), quality
stuff needs to happen," Kaul said.
In one of Kaul's finance courses,
students complete online content
the summer prior to the start of
the course. He said students come

to campus with about 25 percent
of the course material alreadycov-
ered, allowing the class to cover
more topics, in greater detail, by
the end of the semester.
It remains to be seen whether
the implementation of online
courses can add value to education
while reducing costs, but Kaul said
the advent of MOOCs signifies
that price is an increasing concern
on college campuses.
"Education shouldn't be that
expensive," he said. "I think the
public is saying, 'Let's take a break

here and see if we can do a better
job keepingcosts under control"'
While MOOCs could provide
an alternative for U.S. students
who can't afford to come to cam-
pus, he added that they have major
impacts abroad as well, especially
in areas where they may be the
only option available for individu-
als seeking an education.
"We are talking about choices
here," Kaul said. "(In other coun-
tries), they mightnot have choices,
but digital education could pro-
vide them one."

Alleviating injustice
Michigan must provide better protection sexual assault survivors
L a st week, the Michigan legislature recommended
a $37.5 billion budget for the state that included $3
million allocated towards prosecuting sexual assault
cases from unprocessed rape kits. Similarly, the state
government recently put time limits on the retrieval and
processing of rape kits. While it's commendable that the
legislature is taking several steps towards the protection
of sexual assault survivors, the fact that several thousand
rape kits are still unprocessed five years after being found
is deplorable. The state - and the University - must work
harder to ensure sexual assault survivors receive justice.

U.S. President Barack Obama gave
America a harsh reality check on June
10. In the wake of two new public
shootings in the past couple of weeks,
Obama said in a tired, frustrated voice,
"We're the only developed country on
earth where this happens." He went on
to say that Congress refuses to budge
on the gun control laws and that,
"This society has not been willing to
take some basic steps to keep guns
out of the hands of people who can do
unbelievable damage."
During his presidency, Obama has
witnessed countless deaths of innocent
Americans inflicted by other civilians.
't'wenty children and six educators
alone were killed in the Sandy Hook
Elementary School shooting a year ago.
Obama feels trapped - unable through
the powers of the president to use the
tools necessary to make "as big a dent as
we need to."
Though his speech was political in
asking Congress to finally relent and
pass some legislation that will aid in
restricting gun use, it was also social.
Obama pleaded with the American
people to change in order to alleviate
the violence. He said, "The only thing
that is going to change is public opinion.
If public opinion does not demand
change in Congress, it will inot change."
Unfortunately, Obama is right.
First of all, Americans have a warped
conception of what the Second Amend-
ment really means. When the Founding
Fathers wrote that the people should
have the right to "keep and bear arms"
they weren't talking about free gun
ownership across a vast country with
few restrictions. They were referring to
the chaos that ensued before the Revo-
lutionary War and the fear of not being
able to protectoneself. The Constitution
writers were concerned with small mili-
tias being able to support themselves
and carry weapons for protection.
They never dreamed that America
would grow to the size it is today. The
territory west of the Mississippi and
south to Texas was acquired long after
the Founders wrote the Second Amend-
ment. Had they known that this amend-
ment would be interpreted so loosely
and affect so many people in the future
(across such a vast geographic region),
they would have amended the language
to make it safer and more specific. The
point of the Bill of Rights was to protect
people - not to put Americans in dan-
ger or fear of frequent mass shootings
because of a loophole in the language.
Yet indeed, Americans have wrongly
interpreted the meaning of the Second
Amendment to satisfy a desire to own
weapons freely. The problem isn't that

people own weapons - the problem
is the lack of restrictions. Each state
varies, making it easy for someone to get
around the system. The ambiguities in
the organization also allow for a vibrant
black market, which funnels guns to
anyone who wants one. Congress needs
to crack down on this aspect of the
legislation to bring order and discipline
to America. While we live in a "free
country" that does not mean you can do
whatever you want.
Second, we have a deep cultural issue
embedded in America now that the
mass movement of public shootings has
started. When I was little, Columbine
was the big name that everyone
talked about it in fear. It was rare and
exceptional and horrifying. Children
nowadays are growing up in a society
where school shootings are the norm.
They might hear about one every couple
of months. That's a frightening world to
grow up in.
The Tipping Point, as Malcolm
Gladwell has so eloquently explained,
is a phenomenon whereby changes are
influenced by mass culture and by an
effect that spreads ideas, desires and
movements like a virus across the
country or acros s the world. He uses
this Tipping Point to explain the steep
drop in the New York City crime rate
in the 1990s and the huge popularity
of Hush Puppies shoes in the 1990s.
But his theory could also explain the
growing prevalence of mass public
shootings. People see the horror on
TV and get the idea that they can do
the same. They're only egged on more
when they see the shootings pick-
ing up in frequency. Before you know
it the idea of a mass shooting doesn't
seem so unrealistic because we have
become used to it. As disgusting as
that sounds, it makes it easier for
criminals and crazy people to pursue a
mass shooting when ten years ago they
may not have because it simply wasn't
"popular" yet.
I don't know the answer to this
problem. It's clear that the growth rate
of the mass shootings is continuing
to escalate and that several factors -
including gun control - need to be
tackled before that rate can decrease.
But it also takes human will and
cultural norms to change. People need
to start reporting bizarre behavior
of their neighbors and discourage
the violence that has become so
mainstream and accepted in American
society. As Obama put it, we are the
only country that puts up with this
and it's time that we stop.

Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister

In 2009, Michigan State
Police were informed of 11,000
unprocessed sexual assault
kits in an abandoned Detroit
Police Department crime lab.
Since their discovery, about
2,000 kits have been processed
with another 8,000 to be
tested "soon."
While it's admirable that the
legislation allocated funds to
both speed up the processing of
rape kits and prosecute offenders,
still having the majority of
abandoned kits unprocessed
- some kits dating back to the
1980s - is a disgusting failure
by the state government. Given
the large percentage of rape
cases that go unreported, leaving
over 10,000 kits unprocessed
only further affirms the lack
of sexual assault convictions.
Not only does this emotionally
traumatize survivors, but it
allows serial rapists - like the

i00 already identified from 1,600
rape kits - to continue their
patterns of sexual assault. Given
the vast number of cases in an
abandoned storage facility, the
state government must remain
vigilant of similar potential
oversights at other locations.
The volume of unprocessed
rape kits is unacceptable, yet
efforts made by politicians
demonstrate initiative to
prevent this injustice from
ever occurring again. The state
legislature passed a bill that
will limit rape kit retrieval
and testing to further support
survivors. Law enforcement
officials must retrieve the kits
within 14 days of receiving
notice from health department
agencies. The law enforcement
agency must then submit any
sexual assault evidence for
lab analysis within 14 days of
possession. Then, the evidence

must be processed within 90
days by the labs. Enforcing this
new protocol will guarantee
future survivors the safety
of knowing their efforts to
prosecute are pursued with
due promptness.
Given new legislation to more
effectively prosecute rape cases
and increased sexual assault
awareness surrounding recent
campus events, it's imperative
that we educate women about
rape kits. Sexual assault cases
are oftentimes difficult to
process given the potential for
no evidence.A rape kit can solve
this difficulty by providing
survivors the ability to store
evidence that can then be
used to prosecute aggressors.
Through educating and
providing resources to women,
genuine strides can be made to
end the consistency of sexual
assaulters going unpunished.

was no surprise, but since he was
the instigator of so much of the Lan-
nister conflict, I worry that the show
might have offed a crucial catalyst
just to add to the body count.
The fourth season of "Game of

but with mixed results. Every epi-
sode was punctuated by stunningly
directed action sequences and
buckets of carnage, but cheap gasps
don't always make for groundbreak-

season - Arya and The Hound's
fraught friendship, Tyrion's struggle
to prove his innocence, Dany learn-
ing that there's more to being a true
Khaleesi than some cool CGI drag-
ons - used minimal shock tactics.
"Game of Thrones" may sit atop the
Iron Throne of prestige television
for now, but to remain the nonpareil
that it is, "Thrones"has to step up its
game.

Daily TV/New Media Editor
NEW YORK - Less full of itself
than Coachella, more down to
earth than Ultra and a little more
clean-cut than Bonnaroo, The
Governors Ball is New York City's
biggest summer music festival -
but it feels just like an afternoon
in the park with your friends. This
little sibling to the big-name fes-
tivals held its own this year with
a solid lineup, a well-organized
layout and super friendly staff
There wasn't a Native American
headdress or pair of golden span-
dex shorts to be found. (And I only
counted maybe five daisy crowns
total. An immense triumph!) For
a college student and/or hip twen-
tysomething with music taste that
is mainstream-adjacent, Gov Ball
is the perfect chance to catch a
bunch of iconic "alternative" acts
and even make some new music
discoveries.
Friday: The warm-up
Friday's line-up included a
bunch of strong acts, but no one
huge enough to eclipse the head-
liner, OutKast. I started my Gov-
ernors Ball journey the best way
any fun-loving nineteen-year-old
could: with a happy, upbeat set
from the British boy band/legion
of heartthrobs, The 1975. Front-
man Matt Healy periodically took
swigs out of a bottle of wine and
puffs of a cigarette throughout
the early afternoon concert, show-
ing off that classic "don't-give-a-
fuck" 'tude that makes all the gals,
(including this reporter) totally
swoon. "This is a song about smok-
ing weed and stuff," he mumbled
before launching into their hit song
"Chocolate".
My friends and I had had enough
British dudes in tight pants for one
day, but the festival's strategic lay-
out sent us by Bastille's set on our
way to the (amazing) food stands.
The early-Friday-afternoon crowd
was sparse enough to allow a solid
view of the show without being too
small to feel energetic. We paused
for a moment to hear "Pompeii"
and carried on toward the food and
the Gotham Stage, where Washed
Out was just getting ready to per-
form.
We loungedon agrassyhill over-
looking the stage, resting our legs

and saving up energy for the night
to come. As we munched on French
fries and looked out over the New
York skyline across the East River,
sounds of "All I Know" and other
other tunes from Paracosm lulled
us into a happy daze.
The rest was a necessity for the
next set on our agenda, Grimes.
With her lavender hair, killer light-
ing and intense backup dancers,
she proved that she knows how to
put on an awesome show. While
the audience members swayed
awkwardly to her synth-pop beat,
she bopped around stage like a
gothic purple nymph and giggled
at the sheer excitement of the show
itself. When the set ended without
her hit song, "Genesis," festival-
goers shuffled away, visibly a little
disappointed at the anticlimax.
Then she ran back on stage in a
tizzy. "Oops! I forgot to do 'Gen-
Up-and-coming
NYC festival.
esis.' We can do that if you want!"
The crowd swarmed back toward
the stage while Grimes blushed
bashfully about the silly mistake.
We closed out the night with
OutKast, which was a huge event,
in only for the novelty of a limited-
run reunion tour. Everyone in my
group wanted to hear "Hey Ya," of
course, but even aside from the res-
urrection of classic hits, Outkast
put on a solid show, drawing what
might've been the biggest crowd of
the weekend on the festival's open-
ing night.
Saturday: The main event
We went into Saturday prepared
for a battle. This was supposed to
be our longest and fullest day, and
would require intelligent planning
and informed decision-making.
Chance the Rapper, Childish Gam-
bino, Disclosure, Sleigh Bells, Bro-
ken Bells and The Strokes were all
on the schedule, sometimes con-
flicting with each other..

the weekend played out? For more

Seeing so many
individuals in one place reminds
me of the wonderful differences
and similarities between us all. But
in moving to D.C. for the summer,
I was reminded of the one aspect I
absolutely cannot stand: catcalls.
The first incident happened not
even 24 hours after arriving in
D.C. As I walked down H Street in
D.C.'s Chinatown, a man sitting on
the street corner yelled, "Hey sexy,
salaam alaikum!" I was baffled. Not
only did this manthink he could get
my attention by using religion, he
ironically used the wrong religion.
For a second, my Sikh advocacy

I hear similar complaints from
other friends around the world.
There is something to be said
about the loss of intimacy in a
bigger city that allows mento feel
that they have the ability, or that
it's even appropriate, to comment
on a woman's appearance
without any backlash. Projects
have been started recently,
most notably one in New York,
that challenge the notion that
a woman's appearance is up for
commentary.
Yet, it's still troublesome that
when I say goodnight to my
friends, I make sure they text
me once they get home safely,
and actually start to worry as
the minutes tick by before I get a
text. What about how after living
here for only one week, I already
knew that I had to walk a longer
route home to avoid a group of
men that always sits at the corner
near my apartment? Or that, once
the sun goes down, it's essentially
a given that I will either not leave
my apartment or someone will
have to go with me? Our culture
has taught women to be almost
paranoid about the extent to
which their safety is threatened.

Last week, college students
identifying as Republicans,
conservatives, libertarians and
right-leaning independents
flooded Twitter with tweets that
bashed their liberal campuses,
lamenting the bias against them
on their campuses and telling
stories of offensive professors
and students. Perhaps evidencing
a slightly different, but related,
bias, the media brushed off the
trend as mechanism "to vend,
find kindred spirits," as the
Detroit News put it in a recent
article.
While I disagree that political
bias is a problem, it is something
that we need to be talking about.
It's obvious that bias does and
will continue to exist, on several
dimensions and across most
disciplines, forever. Everyone
has an opinion. The problem
only occurs when people are
discouraged from sharing theirs,
while others feel free. The bias
isn't an inherit problem, but
too often becomes one when
discussion is inhibited by a refusal
to understand and work together.
When I was looking at
colleges, I echoed many of
the concerns expressed in the
#MyLiberalCampus tweets. I
saw the University ranked on
some Internet list as one of the
most liberal schools. I ran the
gamut of melodramatic concerns:
What if my professors don't like
me? Can I do well if I disagree?
Will I even like it if there aren't
people who think like me?
None of these things were ever
a problem. Instead, I found
professors that were willing

University alum Charlie Water-

year either with his employer,
United Bank and Trust, or with his
family. An event held by the local
community bank brought him and
other colleagues to the beverage

LSA senior Hannah Smith is
bartending at the Festival's Bever-

makes the job not only enjoyable,

"Whoever you are, there's some-

are definitely regulars and I see a

Along with building connections
between the city and the Univer-
sity, the Festival's array of events is
also partially a product of its focus
on coalition building with local
community businesses. Over the
years, the festival has made efforts
to share resources with local part-

business sector can thrive off of

Jenkins and Hall in "Think Like a Man"
attempted to break into the enter-
tainment industry.
"I got a zillion 'No's' before I got
a 'Yes,' "she said. "I got 'No's' just
to getting an agent. I had someone
tell me, 'No, it's going to require
too much of a push to start you.'
A lot of it is timing. All of a sud-
den, it will just surprisingly fall
into place, like with Terrence. I
hadn't seen him act yet, but when
we had our table read, I couldn't
imagine anybody else (playing the
role of Michael). So, you can break
through anything if you're just
great at what you do."
Jenkins echoed Hall's words of
advice on perseverance.
"I knew going into that role, on
paper, it should've been (a more

well-known actor), so for me
it's just about working hard and
studying the script," he said. "I
knew I was the least-experienced
(actor on set), so I always wanted
to be the most prepared. Humility
gets you a long way, and I've never
been scared to go to Regina and
ask for help."
Hall empathized with a mem-
ory of one of her first prominent,
reoccurring roles on TV's "Ally
McBeal" where she was once in
Jenkins's nervous, newcomer
shoes.
"(It was my) first day, and I had
these braids because I was shoot-
ing 'Scary Movie,' " she said. "I
was so horrified that that's what
my hair had to be. Then the (crew)

tell me, 'You're with Sting and
Robert Downey (Jr.).' There's no
rehearsal; there's no table read
because it's television, and they're
like 'You ready?' I was nervous, so
I spoke really fast, but (her char-
acter, Coretta) was a lawyer, so
I guess that worked out. It was
really fun."
For Hall and Jenkins, a col-
lege education yielded much more
than an advanced degree or an
official diploma - it fostered an
air of discipline and drive that's
served them well as actors con-
stantly moving forward in the
entertainment industry.
"Think Like a Man Too" hits
theaters with a wide release on

"I was in New York, and a friend
of mine who lived in my build-

At the time, Hall was a master's
