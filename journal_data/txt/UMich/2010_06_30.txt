INNOCENCE CLINIC
Clinic to
appeal for
a retr ial
Despite new evidence,
client may return to
prison on technicality
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
Eight years into her prison sen-
tence, Michigan resident Lorinda
Swain was released after the Universi-
ty Law School's Innocence Clinic pre-
sented new evidence nearly one year
ago for her defense in the request for a
new trial.F
But Swain, now 49, could be sent
behind bars once again for the same
crime because the Michigan Court of
Appeals ruled that too much time has
passed since her initial conviction.
A jury trial convicted Swain
in 2002 of sexually assaulting her
adopted teenage son, Ronnie, whose
testimony alone put her behind bars.
Shortly following Swain's conviction,
Ronnie admitted his claims of sexual
assault were false and has since tried
to clear his mother's record.
Sentenced to 25 to 50 years in pris-
on for the four counts of sexual assault
she was convicted of, Swain has always
maintained her innocence and wrote
to the Innocence Clinic - founded in
January of last year at the Law School.
Recent law school graduate Erin
Opperman, a member of the student
staff for the Innocence Clinic, said the
group took an interest in the case upon
receiving the letter from Swain last
spring.
After determining that Swain was
innocent through its own investigation
of the information and that the convic-

'U' officials warn a
mid-year tuition
increase possible
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
The University's Board of
Regents voted 6-2 to approve a
1.5-percent tuition increase for in-
state students and a3-percenttuition
increase for out-of-state students at
their monthly meetingJun. 17.
The vote translates into a net

increase of $178 for in-state students
and $1,064 for out-of-state students.
However, University officials say
some students will actually pay less
to attend the University next year.
In a briefing with media outlets
prior to the Board of Regents meet-
ing, University Provost Teresa Sul-
livan, who will be leaving to assume
the presidency at the University
of Virginia later this summer, and
Philip Hanlon, the University's Vice
Provost for Academic and Budget-
ary Affairs who will take the post
of University Provost in July, said
the University is committing to a
10.6-percent increase in centrally-

awarded student financial aid from
the University and a new Economic
Hardship Program created to help
Michigan families.
"Many students and their fami-
lies will pay less to attend the Uni-
versity in the coming year than they
did last year," Sullivan said, citing
the University's commitment to
meet the full demonstrated financial
need of in-state students.
The in-state tuition increase of
1.5 percent is the smallest approved
by the Board of Regents since 1984.
Sullivan said a major reason the
modest increase was possible was

Invasive carp
passes barrier

'U' endowment

;percent growth

Potential influx of
Asian carp threatens
Great Lakes industries
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Though efforts have been made to
keep the Bighead Asian carp at bay and
out of the Great Lakes, the recent dis-
covery of a carp beyond the electrical
barrier system in place at the Chicago
Area Waterway System has left many
wildlife experts uneasy.
The Illinois Department of Natural
Resources and the United States Fish
and Wildlife Service reported the dis-
covery of an Asian carp - an invasive
species that has ravaged the Missis-
sippi and Illinois river systems - about
6 miles downstream of Lake Michigan,
according to a press release issued last
week.
The IDNR has been sampling the
Chicago Area Waterway System since
February in search of both Bighead
and Silver Asian carp. The fish caught
in Lake Calumet on Jun. 22 by a com-
mercial fisherman contracted by the
IDNR measured 34.6 inches long and
weighed 19.6 pounds.
John Rogner, assistant director of
the IDNR, said no additional Asian
carp have been found after further net-
ting and electrofishing in the area. He
said fishermen will continue to survey
Lake Calumet and the Calumet River
leading to Lake Michigan through this
week, but even if no Asian carp are
found, the threat of the invasive spe-
cies' northern migration will remain.
"One fish doesn't necessarily mean
there are more fish, but it certainly
rings the alarm bell," he said. "We will
never become confident that there are
none in the system. We don't see an
endpoint actually. I think (the search)
will continue for a good long while."
In the event that fishermen find
more of the foreign species, Rogner
said the IDNR may pursue intense fish-
ing and adding Rotenone - a chemical
toxin - in the water. He said that if
implemented properly, Rotenone can
effectively kill the Asian carp, while
sparing other fish that are more toler-
ant of the toxin.
Charlie Wooley, the deputy regional
director for the USFWS in Minneapo-
lis, Minn., said it's too soon to specu-
late what the IDNR and the USFWS
will do if more Asian carp show up.

"If there are additional fish found
... we would reconvene the technical
experts, and we would design another
... kind of control action in that area.
What that would be, it would be too
early to conjecture that right now," he
said.
Wooley did warn, however, that if
there are more Asian carp above the
U.S. Army Corp of Engineer's Electri-
cal Barrier System and they become
established in the Great Lakes, there
would be disastrous ecological conse-
quences.
"They have left a trail of devasta-
tion behind them as they've moved
through the river system. We just do
not want to see that happen in South-
ern Lake Michigan," he said.
The only other Asian carp found
in the CAWS was caught on Dec. 3 of
last year in the Chicago Sanitary and
Ship Canal. Unlike the first fish, the
specimen caught last week was found
above the electric barrier, which was
designed specifically to keep inva-
sive aquatic species from entering the
Great Lakes Basins from the Missis-
sippi River.
According to Rogner, the electric
barrier has three parts but only two
of them are currently fully functional.
Construction on the third will be com-
pleted in the fall, at which point, he
said, the barrier will be a "very effec-
tive system."
Although this is the first fish caught
above the barrier, a research team led
by David Lodge, a professor of biologi-
cal sciences at the University of Notre
Dame, found environmental DNA of
Silver Asian carp in the Calumet River
and Calumet Harbor last year, which
at the time indicated the presence of
the invasive species.
Last week's catch validated Lodge's
findings and has caused great alarm
among state officials.
A report from the Asian Carp
Regional Coordinating Committee,
a group dedicated to the control and
management of Asian carp in the U.S.,
said fish farmers in the south imported
the species in the 1970s to keep aqua-
culture facilities clean and provide
fresh fish for markets.
The destructive path up the Mis-
sissippi River of the invasive spe-
cies began in the 1980s when the fish
escaped into the wild, and they have
since dominated the Mississippi and
Illinois river systems and continue to
move northward.

CFO Slottow
cautions projection
may change
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Despite a significant drop in its
overall investment portfolio last
year, top University officials are say-
ing publicly that they expect to see
above-average returns this year.
The University's endowment fell
more than 20 percent last year, leav-
ing its market value down $1.6 billion.
However, a
communica-
tion to the
University's"
Board of
Regents earli-
er this month
projected that
the endow- KYLE SWANSON
ment would o
Cvngthe
grow by 11.5
percent by
the end of the
year. If reached, the growth would
put the University's endowment to
$6.7 billion - an increase of nearly
$700 million.
Such projections are not typically
released by University officials, who
carefully guard detailed information
about the true market value of the
endowment until investment returns
are formally released at the October
Board of Regents meeting.
However, the estimates given by
Tim Slottow, the University's execu-
tive vice president and chief financial
officer, appeared in a communica-
tion sent to the University's Board of
Regents earlier this month.
The communication was a propos-
al Slottow had submitted to lower the
University's endowment annual pay-
out rate from 5 percent to 4.5 percent.
However, the proposal was tabled
during June's lengthy meeting which
focused on the University's budget.
Despite the technical withdrawal
of the proposal, Slottow verified in an
interview with The Michigan Daily
that the projection of an 11.5-percent
return on the endowment was still
accurate for this year. However, Slot-
tow cautioned that the estimate will
likely not be exact and could end up

being different depending on market
performance.
If the projected performance does
hold true, it would outpace the aver-
age return realized on the Univer-
sity's endowment, which has seen
average growth of nine percent
each year over the last decade. Such
growth outpaces the S&P 500, which
lost an average of 2.2 percent per
year over the same time period, and
the average university endowment,
which earned 4.2 percent per year
over the last 10 years.
And while the University's endow-
ment has consistently outperformed
many other universities across the
country, Slottow's proposal to the
regents to lower the endowment pay-
out rule could help the University to
increase its annual returns further.
In his proposal to the regents,
which may be brought before the
regents in July since it was not dis-
cussed at the June meeting, Slottow
outlined that the change could help
to further insulate the University's
endowment from market volatility
by providing a more consistent, posi-
tive return on the University's invest-
ments. The result would minimize
chances that the University would
see major positive or negative swings
in the market value of its endowment.
If the proposal is approved by the
Board of Regents in the upcoming
months, the change would be the
fourth time the regents have changed
the endowment spending rule since
implementing their first non-absolute
return endowment spending policy in
1986.
University leaders have also said
that any change to the endowment
spending rule would be implemented
slowly to ensure funds are more con-
sistently distributed to units within
the University than in prior years.

CARP
From Page 2
Bighead and Silver Asian carp eat
plankton, a primary food source for
indigenous fish in the Mississippi and
Illinois Rivers, and easily out-compete
those native species.
The ACRCC reported that commer-
cial catch of Bighead Asian carp in the
Mississippi River shot from 5.5 tons
to 55 tons between 1994 and 1997, and
today fishermen catch up to 25,000
pounds of Bighead and Silver Asian
carp in the Illinois River on a daily
basis. The report added that the com-
mercial value of the carp is much lower
than that of the fish they out-compete,
posing severe consequences for the $7
billion commercial, tribal and sport
fishing industries in the Great Lakes.
The ACRCC also warned that Silver
Asian carp, which can grow to over 20
pounds, are a direct threat to people
because they are easily startled by boat
motors and when around one, leap as
high as ten feet out of the water. Boat-
ers and jet skiers in Asian carp-inhab-
ited waters are regularly hit by flying
fish, according the ACRCC.
Joel Brammeier, president and CEO
of Alliance for the Great Lakes - a
group that fights for thepreservationof
the Great Lakes through public policy,
*education and local efforts - said the
only way to avoid an Asian carp inva-
sion is to construct a physical barrier,
known as "hydrological separation."
"It's disturbing to find a live fish, but
the reality is the same," he said. "We
need to separate the Great Lakes from
the Mississippi River. The only solu-
tion that's going to eliminate the con-
cern of invasions of the Great Lakes by
Asian carp or other species is separat-
ing these two water systems."
According to Brammeier, the United
States Army Corps of Engineers has
orders to look into construction of a
permanent barrier, but it hasn't acted
swiftly enough and needs to "get on
the ball and finish the work that it's

been charged to do."
Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) issued
a press release last Friday announcing
that he and Senator Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.) will introduce legislation
this week that will require the USACE
to speed up investigation into hydro-
logical separation.
Senator Stabenow, who has sought
to keep Asian Carp out of the Great
Lakes for years, took to the Senate floor
last weekto urgethe U.S. Army Corp of
Engineers to close the locks connect-
ing the Illinois River to Lake Michigan
until a more permanent solution like
hydrological separation is put in place.
"This isn't just the economy, it's not
just boating, it's not just fishing, it real-
ly is our way of life in the Great Lakes,
and despite efforts that have gone
on for years to stop the fish, it hasn't
happened, and now we have to take
very decisive action to close the locks
immediately so that we can determine
how best long-term to solve this prob-
lem," Stabenow said at the time.
"Asian carp could completely
unwind the food chain with devastat-
ing effects for our existing fish popu-
lations," Stabenow said, which, she
added, would put the $16 billion recre-
ational boating industry and $7 billion
dollar fishing industry at risk.
Mark Denzler, vice president and
chief operating officer of the Illinois
Manufacturers Association, voiced
strong opposition to the proposal to
close the locks, saying cutting off the
waterway would have severe conse-
quences.
"Closing offthe Great Lakes fromthe
Chicago waterways would be economi-
cally devastating," he said. "It would
create an economic ripple, not only in
Chicago, but also in the Midwest."
The IMA is a member of Un-Lock
Our Jobs, a coalition that fights for
keeping Asian carp out of the Great
Lakes without closingthe locks.
Denzler said the waterway is essen-
tial for transportation of resources like
grain, coal, petroleum and road salt,
and closing the waterway would cost

tens of thousands of jobs.
According to the Un-Lock Our Jobs
website, $29 billion worth of materials
pass through the waterway each year,
and a DePaul University study estimat-
ed that closing the locks would cost the
Chicago area alone over $582 million
in the first year.
Denzler emphasized that closing
the waterway would also be environ-
mentally damaging. Without a water-
way, he said, materials would have to
be transported by semi trucks, which
get around 59 miles to the gallon, as
opposed to barges, which average
around 514 miles per gallon.
"From an environmental stand-
point, every barge that's used is equiv-
alent to about 80 semi trucks," he said.
"That's about 6,000 semi trucks of
materials in a week ... that's a convoy
that would go from Chicago allithe way
to Milwaukee."
Denzler said the members of Un-
Lock Our Jobs care about the environ-
ment and appreciate the severity of an
Asian carp invasion just as much as
anyone else but believe that there are
other ways to defend the Great Lakes.
He said he didn't think the electric
barrier was enough to deter the Asian
carp, but additional defenses like bub-
ble barriers, toxins and fish reproduc-
tion control could solve the problem
without having to close the locks.
Denzler said that the political
response to last week's catch was a
"knee-jerk reaction" and that it's still
unclear how the fish even arrived
in Lake Calumet in the first place. It
could have swum up the river, he said,
but it also could have been accidentally
dumped there by someone.
In a June 3 report from the U.S.
Army Corp of Engineers, Colonel Vin-
cent Quarles was quoted as saying that
closing the locks would not be an effec-
tive method of keeping Asian carp out
of the Great Lakes.
"Our analysis incorporated infor-
mation gathered from USFWS and
other Asian carp experts. In the end
the analysis showed that using mea-

sures such as temporary lock closures
will do very little to reduce the risk of
Asian carp migration," Quarles said.
Brammeier said that the concerns
from members of Un-Lock Our Jobs
don't apply to the hydrological separa-
tion that Alliance for the Great Lakes
advocates for because the permanent
barrier would be in a different location
that would not interfere with signifi-
cant resource transportation.

administration to act immediately in
the interest of protecting the lakes.
Brammeier said that whatever
effective temporary solutions that can
be done should be done, but ultimately
federal officials need to work harder
for a long-term solution.

at protecting the lakes is, we have to

tions were chosen for that purpose.
Frankly, the locks don't tell us much
if anything about where a permanent

would do isn't relevant," Brammeier
said.
Last Friday, a group of senators from
the Great Lakes region, including Sta-

(D-Mich.), sent a letter to President
Barack Obama asking for the imme-
diate appointment of a Coordinated
Response Commander who would
oversee the day-to-day efforts of fed-
eral, state and local agencies in keeping
Asian carp out of the Great Lakes.

The wrong kind of tradition
'U' education is becoming increasingly out of reach
W hen the University held its first classes in Ann Arbor in 1841,
in-state students did not pay tuition. Almost 200 years later,
the University is among the most expensive in the nation,
and its annual tuition hike has become a decades-old tradition. A symp-
tom of a state government unwilling to adequately commit itself to edu-
cation, this tradition continued yet again this year. The state should treat
affordable, quality, public universities as an invaluable pillar of a sound
economic foundation and halt its draconian cuts to higher education.

The streets in Washington, D.C.
are organized alphabetically, numeri-
cally and by state name expanding
outward from the Capitol Building.
Streets running east-west start with A
and continue onto Z. Streets running
north-south are numbered: first, sec-
ond, third, etc. Streets running diago-
nally through the city are named after
states. But for those familiar with
D.C.'s policy world, two streets stand
out: K Street and Massachusetts Ave-
nue. On and around these two streets
lie influential institutions that formu-
late many of the policies voiced by our
elected officials.
So when one of these "think tanks"
publishes a paper entitled, "Israel as
a Strategic Liability?" it causes a stir,
especially when it's one as moderate
and centrist as the Center for Strate-
gic International Studies. The fact that
they are asking this question out loud
suggests that policymakers are also
asking it in private.
To be clear, think tanks do not
create policy so much as refine it.
The Obama administration's clashes
with Israeli Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu over the settlements
issue created the space necessary for
a public discussion of Israel's strategic
value to the United States. Until then,
American presidents did not allow for
daylight between U.S. and Israeli poli-
cies. Policy analysts did not even dis-
cuss alternatives to supporting Israel
- regardless of their actions.
One think tank now asking that
question is thetupstart J Street Lobby.
J Street is the only lettered street that
does not exist in the nation's capital,
and the group's founders felt that was
analogous to the absence of their pro-
Israeli, pro-peace point of view from
D.C's streets. Responding to the Israe-
li commando raid on a "PeacetPlotilla"
attempting to bring supplies to Gaza,
they stated, "The blockade of Gaza
hasn't simply failed; it (has) under-
cut the goals it was meant to achieve:
Hamas remains heavily armed and its
hold on the Strip is as strong as ever,
while the people of Gaza suffer - and
they and the world blame not Hamas
but Israel and the United States."
J Street's constructive, thoughtful
criticism of Israel stands in sharp con-
trast to discussions of the flotilla raid
at the University. In conversations
on campus, the flotilla incident has

driven otherwise reasonable people
toward extreme viewpoints. Worse,
this debate has unproductively
focused on the raid itself. Supporters
of Israel, Turkey and the Palestin-
ians would be better off concentrat-
ing on what is best for their respective
nations and peoples.
Turkey will never achieve its
stated objective of European Union
membership so long as it is perceived
as supporting and even trending
toward Islamic radicalism, and it
stands to gain nothing from strained
relations with the U.S. It will gain
on both fronts by acting as an honest
mediator of peace between Israel and
the Palestinian people by supporting
Fatah, the Palestinian Authority and
pro-peace Israelis.
For Israel, the reaction to the Gaza
flotilla is a symbol. It is emblematic
of the way in which their hard-line
approach to the Palestinians is poi-
soning the well of public opinion in
the Middle East. This is driving a
wedge between Israeli and U.S. stra-
tegic interests.
Moreover, what is best for the Pal-
estinian people is for Israel and Tur-
key to pursue peace. The immediate
humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a symp-
tom of the underlying problem, which
is the conflict with Israel. Until peace
is achieved, Palestine's other problems
will never be solved.
Peace, then, is in everyone's inter-
est and U.S. policy should shift to
reflect that fact. The U.S. should no
longer blindlysupport Israel when it
engages in tactical blunders, such as
the flotilla raid. But Palestine's sup-
porters should also recognize that
the Palestinians are not yet a viable
negotiating partner and stunts like
the "Peace Flotilla" only strengthen
groups like Hamas at the expense of
pro-peace groups like Fatah.
All debates about Israel and Pales-
tine - whether they are in Michigan,
D.C. or Jerusalem - should be focused
on how to create peace, not on publici-
ty stunts. A successful effort by groups
like J Street to shift the discussion
away from finger-pointing and toward
the peace process would serve every-
one's strategic interests.

On June 17, the Board of
Regents approved, by a 6-2 vote, a
1.5 percent tuition increase for in-
state undergraduate students, a 3
percent increase for out-of-state
undergraduates and a 2.8 percent
increase for most graduate pro-
grams. For an LSA freshman, that
translates to a $178 increase for
Michigan residents and a $1,064
increase for nonresidents. It will
be the lowest increase since 1984,
despite projections from the state
Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee, which projected a $1.4 mil-
lion reduction in the amount of
support the University would
receive from the state govern-
ment. Citing tough economic
times, the office of the Provost
also announced a 10.6 percent
increase in the amount of finan-
cial aid they expect to administer
during the coming school year.
The state's universities are
enormously important mecha-
nisms for economic growth. The
combined benefit of Michigan's
three largest research universi-
ties (including the University)

to the state's economy exceeded
$14 billion last year, according
to a report commissioned by
the University Research Cor-
ridor. That, according to the
same report, is a $16 return for
every $1 invested by the state
government. Higher education
is arguably Michigan's greatest
resource and its most important
tool for pulling the state out of
its economic slump.
Yet despite the huge payoff,
according to the Alumni Asso-
ciation, in 2009 the state govern-
ment's contribution made up less
than 6 percent of the Universi-
ty's operation budget. That con-
tribution to the University has
dropped 100 million inflation-
adjusted dollars since fiscal year
2002. The state isn't just failing
to provide the ideal of free edu-
cation on which it once prided
itself. It is slowly reneging its
commitment to support higher
education at all.
In the absence of more state
funding, though, that burden has
been passed on to students. And

while the University has made
both a commendable and neces-
sary commitment to provide an
additional $8 million in financial
aid this year, the University does
not escape all the blame. The
administration is curiously debat-
ing whether or not to reduce its
endowment spending this year,
meaning that more money would
have to be raised from other rev-
enue sources like tuition. It also
continues to embark on expen-
sive building and renovation
projects in a fiscal environment
that demands austerity and cost
containment. Such expenses
invariably come on the backs of
students who cannot afford to
pay higher and higher rates for
an education that is increasingly
necessary in an extremely diffi-
cult job market.
Free is the ideal. Affordable is
the baseline expectation. Unob-
tainable is what the University's
education has become. The state
- and the University - must put
the "public" back in "public edu-
cation."

Keeping
A sa revert to Catholicism,
I'm still getting used
to being a public repre-
sentative for a
gorgeous and oft-
maligned reli-
gion. Actually,
I'm still getting
used to churn-
ing the precepts
of said religion
into my heart: ANNA
not complaining PAONE
when my faith is
maligned, carry-
ing the cross of tradition through
the fields of young adulthood,
realizing when I should stand up
for my faith and when I should
offer my other cheek. But given
the never-ending discussion sur-
rounding the Catholic Church at
the moment, I am writing for you
the good Catholic's - the good
person's - response to the sexual
abuse of children by clergy.
I first got wind of this issue
as a ten-year-old who read The
New York Times. Nine years later,
and the terrible acts perpetrated
by the supposed protectors and
teachers of innocent children are
still haunting the contemporary
Catholic hierarchy. I keep my
nose out of the Times these days
(well, sort of - I still read it, but
it doesn't influence me like it once
did), but the specter of the scandal
is just as strong as it once was.
I paraphrase the Pope and any
responsible Catholic leader when
I say that any acts of pedophilia
- or any abuse or intimation of
children, for that matter - are
contrary to both moral and divine
law and cannot be tolerated. For-
tunately, we now live in a time in
which people no longer hide and
cover up such horrible acts. But
some still do commit these atroci-
ties, and we must punish the cul-
prits and comfort the victims as
best as we can.
But how we accomplish that is
the key issue. In many cases, the
response of high-ranking clergy
continues to be slow, ineffective or
nonexistent. This is inexcusable,
and devout Catholics must remem-
ber that they do not invalidate
their faith by admitting that this
is wrong. In more cases than some
reporters would have us believe,
American bishops have responded
with proper vigilance. According
to a United States Council of Cath-
olic Bishops study of 1,671 accusa-
tions, 54.5 percent of priests who
were still active at the time they
were accused were sent for treat-
ment, 45.9 percent of whom were

the faith
suspended. (This amounts to 286
and 241, respectively, as this does
not take into account those priests
who were dead, laicized or had
already retired. Excluded from
the figure of the 1,671 were those
who were exonerated.) But the
study also reveals the awful fail-
ings of the system: no action was
taken in 4.2 percent of cases, and
11 percent of the time priests were
"reprimanded and returned" to
their regular lives.
Sexual abuse is
not in line with
Catholic belief.
I am more than willing to
believe that a great deal of the fin-
ger-pointing and selective report-
age stems from anti-Catholicism,
as the Pope has alleged. After
all, child abuse is contrary to the
Catholic faith, which emphasizes
self-sacrifice and noble deeds for
the sake of your own soul and
the souls around you. And, put
off by the Church's social teach-
ing, many do not believe that it's
a loving religion in the first place.
There's nothing I can do about
that, except pray and be courte-
ous. As a wise priest recently told
me, you can plunge into the deep-
est depths of theology and still
run headlong into mystery.
But - and here I speak to my
fellow Catholics, including and
especially the fair-weather sort
- we must, when necessary,
apologize on behalf of bishops
who did cover for abusers. Let's
send a public message that some
so-called Catholics have failed in
their church, which is ancient and
powerful and, yes, loving. And, if
you are interested in victim advo-
cacy, these cases will have the
potential for you to make amazing
differences in people's lives.
You may wonder if, given all of
the demands and rules, there are
still living, breathing, faithful Cath-
olics stumbling around. Some days
I, too, wonder why I have chosen
such a path for myself. But then I
realize that it, of course, chose me.
And because of this, I will fight for
the children, for the victims, for the
innocent priests and for the inno-
cent in general until I go to, you
know, Heaven - hopefully.

A priority on playtime

y roommate Adam often
accuses me of work-
ing "too hard." I find
this silly - if I
have work to do,
I intend to do it.
Last year, as the
methodic tap- 4
ping of my fin-
gers attacking the
keyboard brought
the tension in the TYLER
room to a boil- JONES
ing point, Adam
would spring
from his seat and say, "You know
what? I think it's time to play some
basketball!"
"Basketball? Now? Listen bud,
I don't know about you, but I have
work here, and there is simply
no time to play," I would protest.
Defeated, Adam would slink back
into his chair, and I would cap off
my Arabic studies with a quick revi-
sion of my Great Books paper.
But these summer months off
have taught me something I couldn't
have learned if I hadn't put the work
away from time to time: play (and
all the dangers of procrastination
that accompany it) is a necessity for
the human brain. From the healthy
development of children to the san-
ity of University students, decades of
research indicate that play is essential
for the cognitive, physical and emo-
tional development of individuals.
I have always operated under the
assumption that if I'm not working
I'm wasting time. Perhaps it's the
years of academic conditioning and
a depressingly thin social life that
has developed such a slave-driver
mentality. But a study conducted
by the American Academy for Pedi-
atrics suggests that play "is inte-
gral to the academic environment."
Furthermore, play has been shown
to help individuals (including anx-
ious incoming freshmen) adjust to

school settings and enhance learn-
ing readiness. But as initiatives like
No Child Left Behind continue to
force American schools to prioritize
and as manic college students anx-
iously prepare for the rest of their
lives, the value of play seems to have
been forgotten.
Today, children are indoctrinat-
ed into a society that demands and
preaches achievement. Even before
birth, programs like Baby Mozart
are used to help children, still unable
to speak, develop spatial intelligence,
creativity and memory. In many
schools, No Child Left Behind has
indirectly incentivized administra-
tors to do away with recess, creative
arts and physical education classes.
Viewed by many as irrelevant, these
valuable times to run and create and
play have been replaced with extra
study sessions.
But what lawmakers and teachers
alike fail to understand is that some
of the most valuable learning is tak-
ing place outside the classroom. The
American Academy of Pediatrics
goes on to explain that undirected
play teaches children to work in
groups, share, negotiate, resolve
conflicts and develop self-advocacy
skills. Perhaps parents should scrap
their volumes of Baby Mozart, can-
cel the extra tutoring session and
allow children to do what they do
best: play.
Because lawmakers and educa-
tors clearly aren't taking up the
cause, an organization known
as Right To Play has become the
unofficial flagbearer for playtime
everywhere. With a presence in 23
countries, Right To Play uses games
to cross ethnic, cultural, gender
and linguistic barriers in order
to enhance child development.
Though you may scoff at these lofty
goals, the results reported on the
group's website speak for them-
selves: according to a 40-year-old
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

refugee from Benin, "For us par-
ents, Right To Play is in fact a whole
school. Right To Play complements
what school does not give, what we
parents are unable to give our chil-
dren."
The human
brain needs a
chance to recover.
According to school principals
in Azerbaijan, student attendance
increased 35 to 20 percent as a result
of Right To Play programming.
Furthermore, parents and teach-
ers in Tanzania noted that children
are more diplomatic and less vio-
lent after playing games and learn-
ing how to communicate. Perhaps
American lawmakers and educators
can learn from Tanzania, Benin and
the rest of the Right To Play commu-
nity: The skills learned when one is
engaged in play may not be quanti-
fiable - there is no "teamwork" sec-
tion on the SAT. But the real-world
applications of these skills, not to
mention the resultant increase in
productivity, cannot be ignored by
those whose job it is to educate and
better our nation's children.
Adam persisted and I eventually
played basketball. It took us thirty
minutes of sports to learn what
American lawmakers and educators
still do not grasp: time away from
work is not time wasted. The human
brain cannot operate on all cylinders
without time to recuperate. So, on
behalf of the inner eight-year-old in
all of us, put the work down, find a
game of basketball and play.

TUITION
From Page 1
due to a commitment within the
University to cost containment,
which will save $39 million in recur-
ring expenses next year alone.
"As a consequence of our sus-
tained efforts, we have a stable
financial base from which we can
continually enhance the educational
experience of our students," Sullivan
said in a statement at the briefing.
In her presentation to the regents,
Sullivan warned that much is left
uncertain at the state level, which
could alter the University's budget
or even tuition levels.
"An important assumption we
must make in advance of the state's
fiscal year 2011 budget is the size
of the state appropriation," Sulli-
van said. "We assume that we will
receive 315.1 million (dollars), which
is the Senate subcommittee recom-
mendation. This reflects a 1.4 mil-
lion (dollar) reduction from what we
budgeted in fiscal year 2010."
However, Sullivan added that the
state's appropriation could end up
coming in lower.
"There is a possibility that the
assumption make here is too opti-
1 mistic," she said while showing the
regents a slide titled, "Contingency
Planning."
The slide, among other things,
said University President Mary Sue
Coleman and Hanlon may have to
seek a mid-year tuition increase if
the appropriation is significantly
less than is currently expected.
Prior to voting on the budget, sev-
eral regents explained their ratio-
nale behind their votes, including

Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bingham
Farms) who voted against it.
"We can do more and we must lead
by example," Regent Denise Ilitch
(D-Bingham Farms) said before vot-
ing against the budget proposal. "It
should no longer be the assumption
that each year we will raise tuition."
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman
(R-Ann Arbor) also voted against
the General Fund budget and tuition
proposals.
Several other universities have
already approved their tuition
increases, including Eastern Michi-
gan University, which chose to forgo
any tuition increase, and Michigan
Tech, which raised its tuition rates
by 5.9 percent, making it the most
expensive public university in the
state.
The University of Virginia, where
Sullivan will become president on
August 1, announced its students
would see a 9.9-percent increase in
tuition levels next year.
The University of Wisconsin
approved a 8.1-percent tuition
increase earlier this year and Ohio
State University announced the
cost of attendance for their students
would be 8.5 percent more than its
value last year.

COURT
From Page 1
tion ought tobe overturned, the clinic
took on Swain's case.
Representing the Innocence Clin-
ic, University Law School profes-
sors Bridget McCormack and David
Moran, along with University Law stu-
dents Opperman, Caitlin Plummer and
Imran Syed - who is also an Arts writ-
er for The Michigan Daily - conduct-
ed a search for new evidence to help
overturn Swain's conviction, which a
press release issued by the clinic states
the original defense attorneys failed to
bring to the court's attention.
In a new July 2009 hearing under
Calhoun County Circuit Court Judge
Conrad Sindt - the same judge who
oversaw Swain's initial conviction -
the clinic presented the court with
Ronnie's new notarized testimony
along with other evidence not available
in the 2002 trial.
According to the release, Ronnie
admitted that when he was 13 years
old in 2002, he was caught molesting
a younger relative and, to protect him-
self, filed the initial accusation of his
mother.
Among the new evidence were tes-
timonies from Tanya Winterburn,
Ronnie's bus driver at the time of the
alleged incidents, and William Risk,
a boy who lived in the same neigh-
borhood as Swain and her son at the
time. The accounts of both witnesses
contradicted Ronnie's original state-
ment.
With the new information present-
ed, Sindt granted Swain a new trial
and ordered her release from prison
in August of last year, the press release
said.

But when Sindt's decision was
brought in front of the Michigan Court
of Appeals by the prosecution on Jun.
8, the court ruled that, regardless of
whether the new evidence proved
Swain's innocence, too much time had
passed since the conviction for a retrial
to take place.
Opperman, who joined the Inno-
cence Clinic in January 2009, has
worked on Swain's case since it was
taken up, said the clinic knew fairly
early on in the quest for retrial that
prosecutors would argue too much
time has passed since Swain's convic-
tion.
"The prosecutors have been basical-
ly unwillingto speak to us," she said.
Opperman also said that this case
isn't the first difficult relationship with
prosecuting attorneys for the Inno-
cence Clinic.
"We've had some contentious rela-
tionships with prosecutors," Opper-
man said. "They're very similar to us,
the defense attorneys, in that they are
vigorously advocating their position ...
Though I can't say that we've had quite
the struggle (in the past) that we've
had in Lorinda's case."
The next move for the Innocence
Clinic is to appeal the decision to the
Michigan Supreme Court, which has
the option of rejecting the case, ulti-
mately upholding the Court of Appeals'
decision.
The clinic's argument for the
Supreme Court is that the appellate
court's interpretation of Michigan

Court rules unconstitutionally keeps
innocent people from being released
from prison.
The Innocence Clinic stated in
the press release that a decision from
the Michigan Supreme Court could
change the fate of wrongly convicted
people across the state.
"In contrast to the Michigan Court
of Appeals' decision in this case, Amer-
ican courts have long recognized that
procedural rules must yield in cases
where a prisoner can prove that he or
she is completely innocent," the press
release said.
If the Supreme Court does take the
case, it could still choose to maintain
the Michigan Court of Appeals' deci-
sion, which would likely send Swain
back to prison to complete her sen-

On Jun. 21, Sindt ruled that Swain's
bond would not be revoked during the
continuation of court proceedings and
that she may continue to stay on her
parents' farm.
Opperman added that the fight with
the prosecution's office is particularly
interesting because, with the new
statement from Ronnie, there is no vic-
tim in the case.
"We don't know who the pros-
ecutor is fighting for right now," she
said.
Opperman said that if the Michigan
Supreme Court either does not take the
case or upholds the Court of Appeals'
decision, the Innocence Clinic intends
to take the case to federal court.

maintenance and collection The city and the DDA each created

"mutually beneficial committees" in
2009 in order to handle the process
of negotiating the parking agree-
ment, but the negotiations have yet
to result in a decision.
Kunselman questioned whether
City Council even needed approval
for the money from the DDA given
that the group was originally created
by the city itself.
"It's not their money by law and
that's what gets missed in the trans-
lation," Kunselman said. "There's
this sense that oh, we have to work
with the DDA and we have to come to
an agreement. Well, no we don't. It's
our money."
Parking arrangements were out-
side of the purview of the DDA until
1992 when the city asked the DDA to
manage the off-street parking sys-
tem. In 2002, the committee took
over management of the on-street
parking system as well.
Executive Director of the DDA
Susan Pollay said that management
and enforcement of parking are not
necessarily the same but are best
handled collectively.
"To us, parking enforcement and
parking operations are two halves
of the same parking system," Pollay

said. "Optimally, enforcement and
operations strategies are planned
and managed together."
The DDA believes that parking
management and enforcement are
best run by the same entity. Cur-
rently, the DDA has a contract with
Republic Parking, a private com-
pany, to handle parking operations.
These operations include running
and maintaining the parking struc-
tures, selling meter cash cards, col-
lecting money from the meters and
reserving metered locations for
private occasions or construction
access.
Officers of the community stan-
dards branch of the police depart-
ment are currently in charge of
parking enforcement, handing out
tickets for parking violations. Police
officers also have the power to issue
parking tickets.
"The DDA itself as a body is not
going to directly enforce parking.
They would contract it out," Kun-
selman said. "I will not abdicate my
responsibility to the community to a
third-party vendor."
Pollay said the DDA wishes to
gain control over parking because its
mission as an agency is to promote

the growth and development of the
downtown area.
"Having an effective parking sys-
tem requires that parking rules and
regulations be established and then
enforced fairly, consistently and
with sensitivity to the fact that most
customers' first and last impression
of downtown begins and ends with
their parking experience," Pollay
said.
Since the $2 million transfer, the
discussion about the parking agree-
ment between the city and the DDA
has not seen any resolution or action.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
that while he believes the DDA's aim
is to create a friendlier downtown
parking atmosphere, he does not
believe a transfer of responsibility
would be beneficial to the city.
"So far, it is just talk. What I think
the DDA wants is a representative
downtown to be there with a smile,
to provide a friendlier face to be
aware of things like aggressive pan-
handling," Hieftje said. "However,
I'm not in favor of the DDA taking
over parking enforcement."
The two "mutually beneficial com-
mittees" have until October to come
to an agreement on the issue.

Inclement weather strikes

Storms, tornadoes,
and earthquake hit
Ann Arbor area
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
The city of Ann Arbor has recently
faced a patch of inclement weather
that has not only included several
tornado warnings but also the after-
shocks of a 5.0-magnitude earth-
quake, which struck Ottawa, Canada
on Jun. 23, according to a recent U.S.
Geological Survey.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said while there was no
damage reported on campus as a
result of the earthquake and recent
string of storms, tornado damage has
been reported in the areas surround-
ing Ann Arbor.
Tornadoes reportedly caused
extensive damage on Jun. 6 in
Dundee, Jun. 24 between Milan and
Saline and Jun. 28 in both Clyde
Township - which resulted in the
death of one man - and New Boston.
Tornadoes that touch down are
tracked on a website - tornado-
paths.org - run by the department of
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sci-
ence at the University.
Dennis Kahlbaum, University

weather observer and staff meteo-
rologist, said there isn't a connection
between the storms and the earth-
quake because the two types of disas-
ters are caused by entirely different
natural processes.
Kahlbaum continued by saying
that it was a total coincidence the
thunderstorms and the earthquake
occurred within the same month.
He added that it is also a coincidence
that there have been so many torna-
does that have formed out of these
thunderstorms.
"The number of tornado warn-
ings in Ann Arbor seems higher than
normal. I don't keep records of that,
but such fluctuations are normal,"
wrote Perry Samson, a professor in
the department of Atmospheric, Oce-
anic and Space Science, in an e-mail
interview.
The peak of tornado season is in
April, but it can continue throughout
the summer, Samson wrote in the
e-mail.
Samson went on to write that he
believes the University's Department
of Public Safety is doing a good job in
alerting students of tornadoes in the
area.
These emergency alerts are sent
out to University affiliates when
they're in imminent danger. Fitzger-
ald said threat levels account for why
alerts were issued for the recent tor-

nado warnings, but not for the earth-
quake.
He added thatthere have been
no changes in the emergency alert
system in light of the recent occur-
rences.
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown
echoed Fitzgerald's comments, say-
ing that there are no changes nec-
essary because the alerts are being
appropriately sent to students, fac-
ulty and staff.
Brown said there is no need at
the moment to revise the DPS disas-
ter response because reliable plans
are already in place for emergency
situations, and the people who are
charged with responding to emer-
gencies are prepared to handle the
issue.

Plotting out the path to Pixar

'U' alums make it big
with the folks behind
'Toy Story 3'
By ANDREW LAPIN
Editor in Chief
EMERYVILLE, Calif. - In the
courtyard beyond the tightly guarded
gates of the studio's entrance stand
bright, cheery sculptures of the lamp
and ball that have come to define the
world of modern animation.
The cavernous atrium that serves
as the central hub of the film studio's
headquarters has a distinct split per-
sonality, as well: A bustling gift shop
with strawberry-scented "Toy Story 3"
Lotso teddy bears acts as a fagade for
the darker, more mysterious corridors
where outsider access is restricted.
Pixar Animation Studios, the phe-
nomenally successful production team
that has made the most critically and
commercially adored family movies of
the past 15 years, understandably has
to protect its secrets. But it also has a
sunny and Disney-fied image to main-
tain, which explains the curious mix of
friendliness and intimidation that this
Mecca of moviemaking has perfected.
Coming from the University, this
blend seems recognizable - kind of
like arriving in Ann Arbor on your first
day of classes. Only much scarier. But
two Michigan alums have managed to
breach Pixar's line of privacy: They got
jobs here.
"I remember my first day, and I
remember parking in the lot and walk-
ing down the front ... walking into the

middle of the atrium, going, 'Oh my
God,'" said Lourdes Alba, a manager
for Pixar and a 1991 graduate of the
School of Art & Design. She gestured
around the two-story foyer, which
was filled with bustling employees,
visitors and small children; replicas of
the company's many Oscars and other
assorted awards glistened in a newly
constructed trophy case nearby. "This
is where I work. And it was completely
overwhelming and completely intimi-
dating."
Alba studied film at the San Francis-
co Art Institute after graduation and
worked with location scouts in Hawaii
throughout the mid-'90s as assistant
film commissioner for the island of
Kauai. She noted that the job was a log-
ical next step for her, and likened loca-
tion scouting to painting with real-life
locations. After witnessing the film-
ing of "Jurassic Park," Alba became
inspired to try a career in the newly
emerging field of computer-generated
(CG) animation. So she moved back to
the Bay Area in 1999 with the ultimate
goal of landing a job at Pixar.
"CG was something very new and
very exciting, and I was completely
taken with it and I started to think
about, 'Well, wow, that's an area of pro-
duction that I would like tobe involved
in,' "Alba said.
Meanwhile, Jody Weinberg, a fel-
low 1991 alum and freshman-year
friend of Alba's, was pursuing a career
in entertainment law. She landed a job
with Disney in 1995 thanks in part to a
studio lawyer and Michigan alum who
put in a good word for her, and worked
with Pixar for the first time that same
year when the original "Toy Story"

was released.
Weinberg, an LSA grad who wrote
for The Michigan Daily her sophomore
year, began working as a contractor
for Pixar in 2003, when the company
started acquiring its own lawyers. In
2006, she became one of the studio's
associate general counsels. Presently
she negotiates deals for the talent
(actors, writers, etc.) and other busi-
ness and legal affairs.
"I always say that as far as lawyer
jobs go, I have the best one," Weinberg
said. She added that she still keeps her
Michigan alumni license plate holder
on her car.
Alba finally achieved her dream job
in 2004, when she was hired at Pixar
as a staff manager. For her first film,
"Ratatouille," she managed the Shade/
Paint Department tasked with placing
on the rats to the glistening oils of the

exquisite culinary artworks that are
made in the movie.
As Alba talked about the challenges
of making CGfood look appetizing, the
smells of the studio's personal chef-
run Luxo Caf6 wafted through the
air. Across the atrium from the caf6
was a kitchen with dozens of cereal
dispensers lined up in an easily visible
row, granting visiting journalists per-
mission to chuckle good-naturedly at
how much Pixar employees love their
cereal.
After "Ratatouille," Alba briefly
managed the Sets Department on "Up"
before going on maternity leave. Next
she moved onto the Art Department
and then the Promo group for "Toy
Story 3," playing a key production role
in everything from Visa commercials
to clips of the fashion-obsessed Ken
doll giving dating tips on "The Bach-

elorette."
While Alba was working at Pixar's
home base in Emeryville, Weinberg
continued to chug away at legal mat-
ters from Burbank, a fair drive away.
The two former friends and Wolver-
ines had no idea they both worked for
the home of Woody and Buzz until
they ran into each other at a "Toy Story
3" meeting.
"We both said that the other one
seemed really familiar, and then it hit
us," Weinberglater recalled via e-mail.
"I still think it is an amazing coinci-
dence."
The two can take pride knowing
that their endeavors helped the film
enjoy the biggest opening weekend
in Pixar's history. Now, after a vaca-
tion, Alba will begin her work on the
upcoming "Monsters, Inc." sequel,
managing the sets department. Wein-
berg will continue to handle business
and legal affairs for the entire Pixar
production and development slate.
By the end of the studio visit, the
fog of quirk that at first threatened to
cloud the Pixar mystique seemed to
have cleared a bit. Even though the
tours still won't allow photography
through any of the upstairs art galler-
ies, talking to the employed University
alums illuminated more of the stu-
dio's process than any of the life-sized
LEGO statues or scooters casually
leaning against tables.
On the way out of Pixar's studio, it
was hard not to notice the giant con-
struction project going on next door.

Bringing Tulip's vision of "The
Seafarer" to life is a production staff
and design team composed mainly of
fellow School of MT&D staff mem-
bers, including costume designer
Christianne Myers, a clinical assis-
tant professor in the Dept. of The-
atre & Drama. For the Performance
Network's production, Myers dressed
Mr. Lockhart in a dark three-piece
suit with a fiery red pocket square. By
costuming the devil in business attire,
Myers unintentionally stumbled on
a recession-era image of the typical
"bad guy."
"I didn't do this on purpose, but
in hindsight I realized that with our
economic climate right now, the bad
guys are the guys in suits," Myers said.
"All the powerful men wear suits, and
there's a lot of negative connotation
with that right now, and I think I
cashed in on that without even real-
izing it."
In addition to being haunted by a
literal demon, Sharky also wrestles
with a metaphorical one - the bottle.
In fact, every character in "The Sea-
farer," even Mr. Lockhart, finds com-
fort in imbibing bottle after bottle of'

Irish whiskey.
As the liquor continues flowing
throughout the show, characters start
to open up to each other. Through
drunken monologues and arguments,
the audience begins to learn the inner
workings of these five Irishmen.
"As damaging as alcohol may be,
there's also a release of defenses,"
Tulip said. "The social niceties tend
to disappear and you actually start
to speak your mind. Interestingly
enough, this play was written seven
years after Conor McPherson gave up
drinking."
"When they think of 'Irish,' (most
Americans) think of green beer on
March the 17th," said Tulip, who
hopes that the production will expose
audience members to a new aspect of
Irish culture as well as change stereo-
types surrounding alcoholics.
"In America, alcoholism is looked
at as one of the worst social evils,"
Tulip said. "Being labeled an alco-
holic, and even labeling yourself an
alcoholic, can tend to obscure the
person."
Just as the play's main character is
saved from a demon of hell, in "The
Seafarer," McPherson shows those
struggling with alcoholism can be
redeemed from for their own demons.

Former rightfielder Angela Findlay graudated last season. Ex-Wolverine Samantha Findlay, pictured right, currenty plays softball for the Chicago Bandits. Angela Findlay changed positions as a Wolverine.
Findlay sisters create different identities at'U'

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Being the younger sibling is never
easy - especially when your older sib-
ling thrives on setting the bar high.
Now imagine how difficult it would
be if your older sister had smacked the
game-winning three-run home run
in the 2005 Women's College World
Series, bringing Michigan softball its
first national championship in the pro-
gram's history.
While Samantha Findlay will
always have that title-winning at bat
associated with her name, her younger
sister, senior Angela Findlay, has met
the challenge and wasted no time in
making a name of her own in the Mich-
igan program.
Angela admits that having her older
sister Samantha already playing at
Michigan "helped (her) out" once she
arrived, but make no mistake about it
- Angela paved her own path to Ann
Arbor.
The path she chose began with a
minor detour, as Angela was an infield-
er in high school but was recruited to
play in the outfield at the college level.
While she called the transition from
second base to right field a "difficult
adjustment," it is a position she has
played with pride for four years.
Angela's ability to adapt to any situ-
ation is just one of the reasons why
she was named Michigan's captain for
both her junior and senior seasons. But
leadership was something her older
sister Samantha had already taught her
a thing or two about.
Samantha served as captain of the
Wolverines during her senior season,
when Angela was a sophomore. While
both Findlay sisters have tallied time
as leaders, their approaches were not
identical.
"Angela leads by example," Saman-
tha said. "She does her job, and she

does it quietly by working hard every
day. She goes out and does what she
needs to do and she loves it.
"I think her biggest asset is that she
is just confident in (the captain's role)
and she likes to have fun. People look
up to her, and she is a leader that every-
body follows afterwards."
SOFTBALL RUNS IN THE FAMILY
Natives of Lockport, Ill., the Findlay
sisters have played softball since grade
school. But Angela's recent graduation
from Michigan and departure from
collegiate softball isn't the end of com-
petitive softball for the sisters - this
time they will both take the field as
members of the Chicago Bandits pro-
fessional softball team.
"Not many sisters and not many
siblings can say that they've played
softball with their sister at every level
possible," Samantha said. "We played
together in grade school, too. In high
school we won a state championship
together ... Not many people can say
that they've played with their siblings
for as long as I have.
"I think that it (has) definitely been
an honor, and we've become best
friends from it."
Being best friends and teammates
for as long as they can remember,
it isn't surprising that Angela and
Samantha chose the same college. But
while the sisters would be in college at
the same time for two years, Samantha
didn't want to heavily influence her sis-
ter's decision.
Samantha - a first baseman - went
on one visit before immediately com-
mitting to Michigan, but didn't want
her sister to feel like she was forced to
be a Wolverine.
"(Angela) was doing her recruiting
and I just told her it would be awesome
if we played together," Samantha said.
"But I said 'I want you to go to a school
where you think you want to go and

make an impact.'
"We've spent all our lives playing
together, but we are two differentplay-
ers. The biggest thing that I told her in
her decision was that I wasn't going to
be there for two years at Michigan and
had that been the choice that she want-
ed, that she would have to be there on
her own (after I graduated)."
But Michigan ended up being Ange-
la's choice and she had made peace
with the fact that she would be the only
Findlay in the program for her junior
and senior seasons.
"Obviously (Samantha) was here,
but it was something where my par-
ents and her, no one ever really said
anything once (Samantha) made her
decision to come to Michigan," Angela
said. "Samantha made her decision
and I was going to make mine no mat-
ter what."
COMPETITIVE FROM THE START
With Samantha already at Michigan
and ready to show her sister the ropes,
Angela immediately worked to take
her game to a competitive college level.
Settled into her new outfield position,
Angela hit a career high .367 and led
the team with 10 multi-RBI games as a
freshman in 2007.
Angela was named to the All-Big
Ten first team and to the National
Fastpitch Coaches Association All-
America third team, quickly proving
to her coaches and teammates that she
wasn't content to simply rest in Saman-
tha's shadow.
"(Angela) has never really lacked
for confidence," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "But her confidence has
really become better and better, even
when she's not having her best game.
When you watch Angela play, you don't
really see the difference between her
good games and bad games, in her
demeanor."
A sophomore in 2008, Angela was a

unanimous selection to the All-Big Ten
first team and named to the Academic
All-Big Ten team after hitting .426
during Big Ten conference play.
That same season, Angela showed
that she shared the same affinity for
late game, high-pressure situations as
her sister.
Angela led Michigan to victory in
the NCAA Super Regional opening
game by driving in the winning run
against Virginia Tech.
"(Samantha) and (Angela) are dif-
ferent as day and night," Hutchins said.
"But even though their style is differ-
ent, they are similar in their approach.
They are always about the 'next pitch.'
(They have) been so integral to our suc-
cess here over the years."
And Angela refused to let her foot
off the gas pedal as a junior. During her
first season as a captain, Angela was
again named to the Academic All-Big
Ten and All Big-Ten first teams and hit
a career-high 13 doubles.
Angela noted that her junior year
was one she will never forget, as
Michigan advanced to the WCWS for
the first time since her sister secured
the Wolverines' title in 2005. While
Michigan dropped out of national title
contention with a loss to Georgia, the
experience of playing in Oklahoma
City with such high stakes is one she
will take with her forever.
"Winning that game (in the NCAA
Super Regional) and getting to go to
the (Women's College) World Series...
that was what we all came here to do,
what people expected us to do," Angela
said.
"It took us a little bit longer than
most people expect, but we learned
a lot of things along the way ... We
learned that nobody gives you any-
thing, you have to earn everything."
As a senior, Angela used Hutchins'
'one pitch softball' mantra and the
experience of the WCWS to help her

arrive at a .350 batting average with 14
home runs and 53 RBI, and a .663'slug-
ging percentage.
"Regardless of how she starts, she
just keeps plugging away," Hutchins
said. "And this is a game where you
really have to preserve and work at
every pitch in the game.
"Mentally it's verytaxing, especially
over the grind of our season. I think
(Angela) has just gotten better and
better at that. She's one of the best I've
ever coached."
IT ISN'T OVER YET
Even though Samantha was no lon-
ger a member of the Michigan squad
during its 2009 WCWS run, Samantha
was available to help her sister dur-
ing all four years of Angela's collegiate
softball career.
The bond that the Findlay sisters
shared both on-and-off the field helped
them cement both their names into
Michigan softball history.
"I know for me personally, I defi-
nitely look up to (Angela)," Samantha
said. "I know not many people think
that you're going to look to your young-
er sibling for confidence, but I look to
her because she has been around me
and the sport (for so long).
"She knows a lot about our games
and a lot about our swings, and I look
to her for confidence and guidance ...
She definitely has helped me when I'm
in a slump."
While Samantha and Angela Find-
lay willbe read about in softball record
books and talked about bytheir former
coaches and teammates at Michigan
for years to come, the duo looks to
continue their past successes in their
future professional softball careers.
on the field - this time as Bandits
- the sisters will once again help each
other reach their potential, as Angela,
in right field, will always have her sis-
ter's back at first base.

Ford wrote.
Following the draft, Harris and
Sims signed contracts to play in the
NBA's Summer League.
On Saturday, Harris announced
on Twitter his plans to play on the
Cleveland Cavaliers Summer League
team, which plays in the Las Vegas
Summer League and runs July 9-18.
Sims tweeted as well, saying he's
signed a summer contract with the
Boston Celtics, which plays in Orlan-
do's Summer League and runs in
early July.
The Celtics and Cavaliers may be
appropriate selections for Sims and
Harris to choose to stick with NBA
teams. It was reported on draft night
that Boston forward Rasheed Wal-
lace will retire before next season,
opening up potential space for a big
man to make the team. But the Celt-
ics drafted Notre Dame forward Luke
Harangody in the second round of the
draft.
The Cavaliers, on the other hand,
already have guards Delonte West,
Mo Williams, Daniel Gibson and
Anthony Parker in Harris' way. But
with the uncertainty surrounding
LeBron James' decision on whether
he'll return to Cleveland next season,

the team could see upheaval in its
roster and a potential need for cheap
talented players.
With the coming and going of the
NBA Draft and yet no certainty in the
futures of Harris and Sims, things
might be more clear after the hand-
ful of summer games are played next
month.
Despite not being selected, there's
still a chance the two can make an
NBA roster.
Last year Marquette senior guard
Wesley Matthews went undrafted
but made an impression in summer
league play. Matthews played in all
82 regular season games, started 48
of them and averaged 9.4 points per
game for the Utah Jazz.
As for Harris, when he announced
his intentions to forego his senior
season back in March, he told report-
ers that he would play in the NBA
Development League or in Europe if
those were his only options.
"If that came up, and it's like I had
to do it, then definitely, because I
love playing basketball," Harris said.
"Whatever route I have to take to get
there, that's my final destination, is
to be in the NBA, whatever route it
is."
