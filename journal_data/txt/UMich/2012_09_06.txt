CREW CUTS

ITS seeks to
enhance user
accessibility
By DANIELLE
STOPPELMANN
Daily Staff Reporter
Though CTools still features
its familiar blue banner, Infor-
mation and Technology Ser-
vices added a slate of new tools
to the website in an update that
was made over the summer.
The new system version
2.7.2A launched on Aug. 4, was
designed to enhance the learn-
ing experience beyond the
classroom by further integrat-
ing tools from Google and other
external sources into CTools.
Students and faculty now
have access to core Google apps
including e-mail, documents,
calendar and Google+ accounts.
A new feature called Box also
provides users with 50GB of
external cyberspace storage
where documents can be saved
and shared.
The new version of the web-
site also strives for increased
interactivity through inte-
gration of Piazza, an online
social media tool that allows
students to ask questions and
review instructor responses.
Interactive training modules

on responsible conduct in
research as part of the Uni-
versity's Responsible Conduct
of Research and Scholarship
Research Integrity Project are
also now available through the
site.
Sean DeMonner, director of
Information and Technology
Services Teaching & Learning,
wrote in an e-mail interview
that the new applications will
give students and instructors
more opportunities to interact
beyond lectures and discus-
sions. ,
"The structured learning
environment of CTools and
the collaborative environment
of Google Apps complement
each other nicely and provide a
bridge from the formal learning
space to the social and experi-
ential learning space," DeMon-
ner said.
DeMonner added that it is a
"navigational plus" to have the
ability to access these external
tools from the CTools site.
User feedback was an inte-
gral part of the upgrade pro-
cess, DeMonner said. Students
and faculty gave feedback via
the 4-HELP phone hotline,
user-testing and CTools evalu-
ations led by students in the
School of Information. ITS
internship students also helped
design and develop tools.

NATIONA L EPIDEMIC
WestNilespikes in U.S.

105 total cases
reported across
Michigan
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
Mosquitoes carrying the
West Nile virus have infected
more people in the United States
this summer than ever before
experts say, despite a scorch-
ing season that caused severe

droughts throughout the coun-
try.
According to the Michigan
Department of Community
Health, there were 105 reported
cases of West Nile in Michigan
as of Wednesday. Nationally, the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has now reported
1,993 cases and 87 deaths as of
Sept. 4, making it the worst year
the country has experienced
since 2003.
Public Health Prof. Mark
Wilson said though the virus

has now been found in almost
every county in the United
States since it arrived in 1999,
it is fairly new to the region.
According to Wilson, West Nile
likely first entered the United
States by boat from Israel and
spread from bird populations
to mosquitoes, before humans
began contractingthe disease.
Wilson said that while most
mosquitoes usually die off dur-
ing dry conditions, the Culex
mosquito, a prominent carrier of
the virus, is able to survive with

limited rainfall.
"Different species of mosqui-
toes end up preferring breeding
sites and concentrated water
that is more often found dur-
ing the dry season," Wilson
said. "So your backyard might
be a suitable breeding place for
some species of infected mos-
quitoes, but a hundred meters
down the road where there are
houses without much vegetation
it might not be."
Wilson and other experts said

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Many dead fish
litter Ontario
shore of Lake Erie
Canadian officials say tens of
thousands of dead fish are it-
tering a section of Lake Erie's
northern shoreline.
Ontario Ministry of the Envi-
ronment spokeswoman Kate
Jordan said Wednesday that the
fish washed ashore last weekend.
She says they likely died of natu-
ral causes, although officials are
still awaitinglab analysis results.
The fish were scattered along
a 25-mile stretch between the
cities of Windsor and London.
She says a likely explanation
for the fish deaths was a so-
called "inversion." That happens
when temperature changes send
water with low oxygen levels
from the bottom to the surface,
causing fish to suffocate.

7-year-old Colo.
girl recovers from
bubonic plague
The parents of 7-year-old
Sierra Jane Downing thought
she had the flu when she felt sick
days after camping in southwest
Colorado.
It wasn't until she had a sei-
zure that her father knew some-
thing was seriously wrong and
rushed her to a hospital in their
town of Pagosa Springs. She had
a"107-degree fever, and doctors
were baffled by the cause.
"I didn't know what was going
on. I just reacted," Sean Down-
ing said. "I thought she died."
The Downings eventually
learned their daughter was ill
with one of the last things they
would've thought: bubonic
plague, a disease that wiped out
one-third of Europe in the 14th
century but is now exceedingly
rare - it hasn't been confirmed
in Colorado since 2006 - and
treatable if caught early.

Kitten goes for
100-mile ride on

A woman says a 6-week-old
kitten hitched a ride on the out-
side of her vehicle as she drove
about 100 miles over upstate
New York roads.
Stacey Pulsifer tells the Press-
Republican of Plattsburgh that
she recentlydrovefromherhome
in Plattsburgh to Elizabethtown
in the Adirondacks, then back
to her apartment. Along the way
she stopped for coffee and heard
meowing conming from her Jeep.
She asked two friends to help
her search the vehicle. They
. finally found the kitten wedged
behind a bumper and had to cut
it free.
Pulsifer has since adopted the
hitchhiker and named it Pump-

kin. She estimates the lucky
black cat was lodged in the car
for about 22 hours and traveled
some 100 miles. She suffered a
broken paw during the ride.

CALLIE MCCOYVIA INSTAGRAM/,
President Barack Obama joins former President Bill Clinton on stage after Clinton addressed delegates at the Demo-
cratic National Convention Wednesday in Charlotte, N.C.
Clinon offers passionate
'defense of Obamna's record

Former president
says GOP has
been unwilling to
compromise
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -
In an impassioned speech that
rocked the Democratic Nation-
al Convention, former Presi-
dent Bill Clinton proclaimed
Wednesday night, "I know we're
coming back" from the worst
economic mess in generations
and appealed to hard-pressed
Americans to stick with Barack
Obama for a second term in the
White House.
Obama strode onstage as
Clinton concluded his speech.
The 42nd president bowed, and
was pulled into an embrace by
the 44th as thousands of del-
egates jammed into the conven-
tion hall roared their approval.
Clinton, conceding that many
struggling in a slow-recovery
economy don't yet feel improve-
merst, said circumstances are
indeed getting better, "and if
you'll renew the president's con-
tract you will feel it."
To more cheers, he said of
Obama, "I want to nominate a
man who is cool on the outside
but who burns for America on
the inside."
Not long afterward, the del-
egates formally awarded Obama
their nomination to a second
term in a post-midnight roll call
of the states.

Clinton spoke as Obama's
high command worked to con-
trol the political fallout from
an embarrassing retreat on the
party platform, just two months
from Election Day in the tight
race with Republican challenger
Mitt Romney.
Under criticism from Rom-
ney, the Obama camp abruptly
rewrote the day-old document
to insert a reference to God and
to declare that Jerusalem "is
and will remain the capital of
Israel." Some delegates objected
loudly, but Los Angeles Mayor
Antonio Villaraigosa, presiding
in the largely-empty hall, ruled
them outvoted. White House
aides said Obama had personal-
ly ordered the changes, but they
did not disclose whether he had
approved the earlier version.
The convention concludes
Thursday with Obama's accep-
tance speech before a prime-
time national TV audience.
Aides announced he would
speak in the convention hall
rather than a nearby 74,000-
seat football stadium as origi-
nally planned. They cited
weather concerns as the reason
for the switch in a city that has
been hit by heavy rains in recept
days.
Romney, nominated at his
own convention last week, spent
his second straight day in Ver-
mont preparing for next month's
debates with Obama.
Clinton's speech was deemed
so important by Obama's cam-
paign aides that they delayed

the president's formal nomi-
nation to a second term until
it was over. The familiar roll
call of the states began well
after television prime time in
the eastern part of the country,
and the hall was emptying out
rapidly as it dragged on past
midnight.
Obama's campaign hoped the
former president would prove
especially persuasive in an era
of sluggish economic growth
and 8.3 percent unemployment.
Clinton is exceptionally popu-
lar 12 years after he left office,
particularly among white men,
a group among whom Obama
polls poorly.
The speech was vintage Clin-
ton, overlong for sure, insults
delivered with a folksy grin,
references to his own time in
office and his wife Hillary, all
designed to improve Obama's
shaky re-election prospects.
The convention hall rocked
with delegates' applause and
cheers the former president
strode onstage to sounds of
"Don't Stop Thinking About
Tomorrow," his 1992 campaign
theme song.
He sought to rebut every
major criticism Republicans
leveled against the presidept at
their own convention last week
in Tampa, and said that in fact,
since 1961, far more jobs have
been created under Democratic
presidents than when Repub-
licans sat in the White House,
by a margin of 42 million to 24
million.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) -
Waves from Hurricane Isaac
uncovered oil previously bur-
ied along Gulf Coast beaches,
exposing crude that wasn't
cleaned up after the BP spill in
2010.
Since Isaac made landfall
more than a week ago, the water
the storm has receded and tar
balls and oil have been reported
on shores in Alabama and Loui-
siana, where officials closed a
13-mile stretch of beach Tues-
day.
BP said Wednesday some of
that oil was from the spill, but
said some of the crude may be
from other sources, too.
"If there's something good
about this storm it made it vis-
ible where we can clean it up,"
BP spokesman Ray Melick said.
BP' still has hundreds of
cleanup workers on the Gulf
Coast after the Deepwater Hori-
zon drilling rig exploded, killing
11 workers and leading to the
nation's largest offshore spill.
Melick said the company was

today. ,
Isaac made landfall near
Fourchon on Aug. 28 as a Cat-
egory 1 storm, pummeling the
coast with waves, wind and
rain. Seven people were killed in
.Louisiana and Mississippi..
Ed Overton, a chemist and oil
spill expert at Louisiana State
University, said the exposed oil
was weathered and less toxic,
though it could still harm ani-
mals - such as crabs, crawfish
and bait fish.
He said the storm helped
speed up natural processes that
break down oil and it might take
several more storms to stir up
the rest of the oil buried along
the coast.
"We don't like to say it, but
hurricanes are Mother Nature's
way of takinga bath," he said.
The reappearance of oil frus-
trated state officials.
Garret Graves, a top coastal
aide to Louisiana Gov. Bobby
Jindal, accused BP of not being
aggressive enough with its ini-
tial cleanup.
"If they would put just a frac-
tion of the dollars they're put-
ting into their PR campaign into
cleanup, we'd certainly be much
farther ahead than we are now,"

he said.
BP has spent millions of dol-
lars on its public relations cam-
paign, but the company has
not said exactly how much it
has invested. Its cleanup and
response costs over the last two
years were more than $14 bil-
lion and more than 66 million
man-hours have gone to protect
and treat the Gulf shoreline, the
company has said.
BP also gave $1 million to the
American Red Cross and The
Salvation Army to help victims
of Isaac.
Along the oiled Fourchon
beach, officials restricted fish-
ing in waters extending one mile
offshore. The state Wildlife and
Fisheries Department said there
was a large mat of tar on one
beach and concentrations of tar
balls on nearby shores.
In Alabama, officials said the
tar was more of an unsightly
nuisance than a health hazard,
describing globs as ranging in
size from a dime to a half dollar
coin.
"There are areas where there
are significant deposits," said
Phillip West, coastal resources
manager in Orange Beach, Ala.
Samples from both states
were being tested to determine
whether the tar was from BP's
Macondo well.

Explicit guidelines
Vague acadmic honesty policies pose problems
A t Harvard University, more than 100 students are being
implicated in a cheating scandal after they were caught
writing nearly identical answers for a final exam, a set
of take-home essay questions. While the exam directions forbade
collaboration with other students, many students claim that group
work with both other students and instructors was normal in the
class. Though the students were entirely in the wrong - academic
honesty should be expected from all'- the policies were unclear,
and defining what constituted misconduct was difficult at best.
Universities should work to define explicit cheating policies and
punishments, and professors should reinforce these guidelines in
individual classes, in hopes of avoiding similar scandals.

"I often disagree with Republicans, I.
actually never learned to hate them the way
the far right that now controls their party
seems to hate our president.
- Former president Bill Clinton said during his keynote address at the
Democratic National Convention in Charlottes, N.C. Tuesday night.

If the students are found guilty of cheating,
the university suspend the students for a year
if found in violation. The diplomas of the stu-
dents who graduated in 2012 will be revoked.
According to The New York Times, some fami-
lies of students are threatening to sue Harvard
should these sanctions be enforced.'
It's impossible to defer total blame to the
students if they are unsure of what consti-
tutes cheating. While the course was assisted
by graduate student instructors, their teach-
ing methods varied between class sections.
Several instructors essentially gave answers
to the students. If an instructor was actively
assisting students on the exam, it's under-
standable that students would think collabo-
ration was acceptable. The take-home exam
was also "open note, open book, open Inter-
net," etc. This policy allowed students to use
a multitude of resources - though the exam
directions clearly stated that the examinees
were not to use each other.
Professors must be wary of too few explicit
guidelines defining academic honesty. As
professors control the course, they shouldn't
pass on grades entirely. Still, the responsi-

bility lies on the graduate student instruc-
tors teaching the courses and grading the
exams in a discussion class - as it does on
the students who took advantage of an "open
book" exam. Though ignorance or confusion
regarding rules is not an adequate defense,
it remains that universities such as Harvard
should employ a clear zero-tolerance policy
for academic dishonesty.
Many work environments are pushing for
team based efforts, which rely heavily on
workplace collaboration. College students
should be learning to collaborate effectively
with peers to better prepare for whatever
happens after graduation. Students should be
encouraged to work together as an effective
study tool.
To avoid future scandals, universities
should work to ensure plagiarism and cheat-
ing policies are completely transparent. Pun-
ishments for these actions should also be
made clear by clarifying what is and is not
academic honesty in written, oral and online
form. These rules and consequences need
to be transparent enough that all involved
understand the university's policies.

For me, e-mailing is an almost
painful form of communi-
cation. Opening my Uni-
versity e-mail homepage is a bit
frightening, as
30 new e-mails
marked "Impor-
tant" glare at me
behind urgent
subject lines.
Even if many of
these e-mails are
from Groupon
informing me of ADRIENNE
the latest mas- ROBERTS
sage deal, it still
takes a substan-
tial chunk out of
my day to go through and appropri-
ately respond. This is without a real
career, where the amount of e-mails
must increase exponentially.
But e-mail is a fact of life at this
point. It was quite the shock this
summer - I spent nine to five in
an office environment - to see just
how many e-mails were exchanged
each day. From internal e-mails
with links to Buzzfeed articles
about Ryan Lochte's narcissism to
a 20-e-mail exchange just to set up
a meeting with a client, my inbox
filled quickly. It seemed as though
e-mail trumped almost every other
form of communication, including
face-to-face conversation.
E-mailing about anything and
everything - and taking a substan-
tial amount of time to do so - was
not unique to my workplace. Grow-
ing up, my mom, a teacher, would
always dedicate her Sundays to
checking and responding to e-mails
she received over the weekend. I
never understood why she did that
until now.
It seems as though people con-
sistently complain about e-mail, yet
use it obsessively. In a way it makes
sense, because it's the only form of
communication that people from all
generations can use with relative

ease. And written communication
will continue to trump face-to-face
conversations and phone calls in
business settings.
But that doesn't mean the art of
writing an e-mail is innate. Like
anythingyou draft, it takes practice
to develop your voice in an e-mail
while simultaneously getting your
point across effectively and con-
cisely. And it takes some people
more time than others to master
this skill.
Just like any other form of com-
munication, we subconsciously
judge the tone and style of e-mails.
Adding too' many exclamation
points runs the risk of looking
juvenile and unprofessional. But, if
you're too short and direct, you risk
reading demanding and rude.
For any job, even that first job in
high school, e-mailing is an over-
looked, yet important skill. Accord-
irig to new data released from the
McKinsey Global institute, the
average employee spends 28 per-
cent of their workweek reading and
responding to e-mails. That may
not seem like a lot, but it adds up to
about 13 hours a week, or 650 hours
a year.
A series of studies from 2005
found that the. sender of an e-mail
is overly egocentric in how they
believe their e-mail is received. One
study in particular found that sar-
casm in e-mails was only commu-
nicated effectively about half the
time. Clearly, miscommunication is
common between coworkers, man-
agers and their clients.
It's ignorant to assume that
e-mail is a trivial form of communi-
cation. But, most universities don't
exactly prepare you for proper
e-mail etiquette, Michigan includ-
ed. The Sweetland Writing Center
offers one-credit courses in the
rhetoric of blogging, approaches to
the podcast and new media writing
for non-profits; all very important,

yet less-widely used forms of com-
munication. Sweetland should look
into offering a similar course for
the art of e-mail writing. It's a text
that provides a great opportunity to
analyze the impact of a particular
word choice,.or the how a certain
tone sounds to other people.
Online
communication
skills are vital
to learn.

0

Long-form writing, while
important, should not be taught
exclusively with more specific com-
munication omitted. My generation
is used to obtaining information
and communicating briefly, from1
a 140-character Tweet to a hur-
ried text message. Being persua-
sive in as few words as possible - a
skill extremely important to many
careers - is not emphasized enough.
Whether it's a one-credit course on
how to write an e-mail or an English
class solely based on short-form and
new media writing, this should be a
priority at the University.
Ideally, people would take
advantage of other forms corre-
spondence. From Facebook groups
to Tweeting, these alternatives to
e-mailing will hopefully prevail.
They're less stressful to read, and
they're certainly less intimidating
than a stuffed inbox. But until that
point, e-mail remains strong. And if
there's one thing Ilearned this sum-
mer, a misplaced exclamation point
can be uncharacteristically killer.

Lessons from South Africa

The new jack-of all-trades

When I came home from Africa, I gave
away half of the clothes in my closet. After
meeting children with no shdes huddled in
unheated shanties, I wanted to live with less
in order to live with more. Those clothes
wouldn't find their way to the deprived com-
munities I had experienced. I suddenly felt
disgusting for jamming my drawers with
shirts of every style and color of the rainbow.
The poignant eyes of the African children
looking up at me inspired a lifestyle change.
Let me let you in on a little secret: Happi-
ness can indeed be achieved without material
goods. What brings meaning'to our lives? Usu-
ally pursuing what makes us happy. As students
at a top university, we should think persistently
about how to make other people - and ourselves
- happy, and the world a better place.
On our ten-day trip to South Africa this
summer, the University's Women's Glee Club
had several moving experiences. Not only did
we sing with the most spiritual choirs in the
world, but we shared our music with people
who have nothingmore than the shirt on their
back - people who live day to day not knowing
where their next meal will come from.
In general, the South Africans I met had
an easier time seeing the important things in
life than Americans. Part of their culture is to
embrace ideas that make them happy instead
of focusing intently on subjects that don't
give them pleasure. They sing in the streets
and smile by default. Many are dirt poor with
no running water, yet they did not cast judg-
ment when we drove into their shantytowns
in Mercedes buses. Instead, they looked up
at us with tears in their eyes after we sang,

blessing us for sharing our music with them
in a church or rustic banquet hall.
When I arrived back in the United States, I
had a revelation. I bolted up in the middle of the
night - perhaps due to six hours of jet-lag -and
made plans to push material things out of my
life and pull the spirit in. I sorted my clothes
into piles. I took them downtown to a local
community center and felt a gratifying twang.
in my heart when I handed over the bags.
This story is not a pat on the back for donat-
ing clothes, nor is it about how you should go
clean out your closet (though I do suggest the
latter, it's an amazing rush). Americans, and
college students in particular, get too caught
up in superficiality. We get too obsessed with
the newest pair of rain boots or the costly
bottle of booze, and that's without mention-
ing the new pair of jeans every girl "needs" to
make sure she looks just right. On the other
hand, the South Africans have an optimistic
outlook, originating from a wise sensibility.
We need to look at life like the South Afri-
cans I met. I ain not saying everyone who
cannot sing needs to try; rather, every per-
son should pursue what he or she truly loves.
Care less about what you are wearing and
more about what you are doing while in those
clothes. Try looking at your material goods as
non-essential items for daily living, because
chances are, half are unnecessary. Here at
Michigan, we need to make sure that the con-
centration we choose is going to help us make
a positive difference in the lives ofothers, not
necessarily a difference in our bank accounts.

was apparent
that I was pretty
good at alot of things but not truly
excellent at any single thing. Every-
one around me seemed already
narrowing down their interests or
cultivating a particular talent but I
was lost. I had always loved being
the jack-of-all-trades. Couldn't I
just stay that way?
There was, of course, a time
when it would have been accept-
able to have so many interests and
talents -'the Renaissance. So-called
"rebirth" of European cultural
and scientific advances in the 14th
through 17th centuries spawned a
number of people with historical
figures in a wide variety of arenas.
Great minds such as Leonardo da
Vinci still escape traditional single-
word occupations, and were revered
for their many interests and abili-
ties. Da Vinci, for'example, was a
painter, scientist, musician, cartog-
rapher, inventor and much more
- the quintessential "Renaissance
man." This was an era where society
not only accepted, but highly valued
multi-talented people.
But, obviously society has
changed alot since those days. We've

now come to channeling our efforts
into a single direction for increased
specialization. Students are expect-
ed to choose a field of study early on,
and the people who are most revered
for their knowledge in our world are
those with Ph.Ds - which are noth-
ing more than testaments to a per-
son's full expertise in an extremely
narrow, specific discipline. Some-
one who does many things but can't
choose a single one to gain expertise
in is deemed a jack-of-all-trades. The
connotation is overtly negative, as
he or she is not just the Jack-of-all-
trades- such a person is often con-
sidered a "master-of-none." Perhaps
it's important to choose a specialty,
a single-word occupation for the
world to know each of us by. But I'd
like to think there is still some value
in being knowledgeable or talented
in many areas.
I'm an engineering student, but
I took a class in environmental law
last semester. I'd eventually liketo go
into this field, but it isn't entirely rel-
evant to my undergraduate studies.
Although I intended to take it purely
out of interest, I was surprised to
find that it provided the most rel-
evant background for my internship
this summer. My employer was more
impressed with my knowledge of
American environmental legislation
and regulation than any of my engi-
neering studies, and it played a daily
role in the work I did there.
My experience could be written
off as isolated, but I've talked to many
fellow students who've had similar
experiences in the workplace. Inter-
disciplinary approaches to problems
are becoming more valuable and
appreciated. Too many students fall
into the trap of over-focusing on a

single subject. This kind of focus can
be beneficial to many disciplines, but
it also can detract fromtheir market-
ability and performance. Times have
certainly changed since the Renais-
sance, and today's society demands
more specialization. This specializa-
tion, however, shouldn't come at the
loss of a general awareness of other
subjects. The oft-referenced "absent-
minded professor" comes to mind:
someone who is brilliant at what
he or she does, but is confounded
by everyday life. Sure, society isn't
breeding us all to be so extreme -
but it is certainly beneficial to be
knowledgeable in areas outside our
immediate focus area.
Carve your own
niche of interest,
but stay open
minded.
So go ahead and take that class
on the discovery of DNA or fascist
cinema or American business his-
tory. Carving a niche for yourself is
important, but so is being aware of
the world around you. We may not
all be Leonardo da Vincis. However,
we can still do our part in growing
a generation of well-rounded, multi-
talented thinkers and leaders - the
new jacks-of-all-trades.

'M' prepares for triple option
Air Force brings
gimmick offense to

Wolverines hope to
find footing on offense

' Ann Arbor for
home opener
By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
When the Michigan foot-
ball team trudged off the field
at Cowboys Stadium follow-
ing a 41-14 loss to Alabama on
Saturday night, it was clear
the defense had a considerable
amount of improving to do.
Veteran defenders lacked
discipline on their assignments
and missed tackles through-
out the contest. The defensive
line failed miserably at closing
off running lanes. The second-
ary struggled in the absence of
standout sophomore cornerback
Blake Countess, who tore his
ACL in the first quarter and will
miss the rest of the season.
Unfortunately for the Wol-
verines, they'll be trying to
rebound against Air Force's
mind-boggling triple-option
offense. Though the Falcons
aren't necessarily considered
one of the premier programs
that will show up on Michigan's
schedule this year, they do pres-
ent a number of challenges for a
defense that appears to be ailing
early in the season.
"(It's) just mass chaos -
there's three options on every
play," said senior defensive end
Craig Roh on Tuesday. "It's
smoke and mirrors really, is
what it is. The defenders just
have to play their key and play
their assignment."
Michigan coaches and play-
ers this week have emphasized
the irpportance of staying dis-
ciplined on the defensive side of
the ball. Air Force is lauded as
an incredibly disciplined team,
and if senior quarterback Con-
nor Dietz sees a defender out
of position, he will exploit the
mistake by hitting the correct
option. Even Roh, who is one of
Michigan's most experienced
defenders with 39 consecutive
starts going into Saturday, has
to be more disciplined in his
approach than he was Saturday.
"In fact, Craig Roh's biggest
problem in (the Alabama) game

was he was trying to

flexible in practicing their game
plan this week, trying to mimic
the Falcons as best they can.
"They'll never get close, but
Joe Reynolds is coming down
and doing some of the quarter-
back work, imitating Connor
Dietz - he's done a nice job
with it," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke. "Up front, offen-
sively, those guys are working
at it. (Freshman) Ben Braden
and some of those guys, it's a
little different because they're
265 (pounds) and Ben's a
300-pounder."
Air Force's starting offensive
linemen actually average about
254 pounds, which is far less
than Michigan's average of 304
pounds, so it is understandably
difficult to replicate the mobil-
ity of the Falcons' offensive line-
men.
If the Wolverines are look-
ing for a silver lining, though,
they'll have to remember that
Air Force's undersized offen-
sive line is likely much easier
to play against than Alabama's,
which averages 314 pounds and
is largely regarded as the coun-
try's best.

Kennedy, Reynolds to debut song at Big House

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
As quarterback and wide
receiver, Jack Kennedy and Joe
Reynolds were always a likely
tandem. They met three years ago
and quickly struck up a chemistry
on the field, as Reynolds hauled in
Kennedy's passes.
In time, Kennedy noticed
something in Reynolds, some-
thing he'd never had in a wide
receiver before - this guy Reyn-
olds had some serious pipes.
Kennedy and Reynolds start-
ed to meet away from the field,
trading in the football for a lap-
top and their cleats for a couple
pairs of headphones. Today, three
years later, they are known as
JDK&Rey, a rap and R&B duo.
Reynolds provides the soaring
melodies while Kennedy works
the wordplay and rhymes. They
combine to do all of their own
production.
One of the duo's songs, "Hun-
dred Level", their third release of
the summer - will be included in
the Michigan Stadium pregame
mix prior to the Michigan's home
opener against Air Force on Sat-
urday.
JDK&Rey collaborated with
the Michigan Marching Band
for "Hundred Level" as an early
 showcase of their unique flair.
Early this summer, they adopt-
ed the name JDK&Rey and start-
ed to publish the trove of music
they had already compiled - or
"stockpiled," as Kennedy put it.
First came "Away," which was
 recorded more than a year ago.
Then "Kenny's Anthem," which
details the ups and downs of
senior linebacker Kenny Demens'
dating life.
"For some reason, everyday
they said, 'Hey Kenny, how's it
going with your girlfriend?' "

Demens said. " 'Oh, we're off,
we're on, we're off, we're on. This
happened, that happened.'
"I didn't know that they were
taking notes and making a song
about it."
Finally, they wrapped up the
record and Reynolds e-mailed it
over to Demens.
"At first I didn't believe it,"
Demens said. "I thought they
were kidding. They kept saying,
'Hey Kenny, we've got a song
about you.' "
His reaction?
"I couldn't stop listening to it."
Demens said.
The music video for "Kenny's
Anthem" will be released on Sept.
12. And, no, Demens won't be
in the video - Reynolds played
his role. "Hundred Level" was
released on Aug. 10 in preparation
for the season opener.
Kennedy remembers coercing
a hesitant Reynolds into the stu-
dio three years ago. That's when
their musical relationship began.
Kennedy had some beats on his
laptop; Reynolds heard them and
was sold.
At first, the duo was joined by
former Michigan offensive line-
man Ohene Opong-Owusu at
first. Opong-Owusu played the
piano, Kennedy the drumset and
Reynolds the acoustic guitar.
They had all the pieces.
"Well, we might as well do
something with this," Kennedy
said.
In fall camp two years ago, the
coaching staff held a talent show.
Teammates urged Kennedy and
Reynolds onto the stage. (It didn't
take too much coaxing.) They did
a short set, joined by punter Will
Hagerup on electric guitar, and
waited for feedback.
The feedback came quickly.
"Theguys just went nuts," Ken-
nedy said with a smile. "They had

no idea we could even do that."
At the Sugar Bowl in Janu-
ary, the football team took a boat
ride down the Mississippi River,
the massive artery dividing New
Orleans. Kennedy, Reynolds and
Hagerup took the stage again to
serenade the crowd. They have
also performed at Mock Rock, in
front of an audience of a couple
thousand. But the big unveiling
will be at the Big House on Sat-
urday.
Kennedy got his start in music
back in high school, playing
drums in a rock band. He dabbled
in rapping but didn't record any-
thing until he came to Michigan.
"I'm just trying to be creative
with flows and actually say some-
thing in the music," Kennedy

said.
Reynolds has been a crooner
for years, but his musical talent,
he said, started when he moved to
Rochester, Mich. and was taught
guitar by a friend in school. He
pinpoints to New Orleans-based
singer-songwriter Frank Ocean
as one of his favorite artists.
The group has taken to Face-
book and Twitter to promote
themselves, but most of the atten-
tion has been drawn in by Michi-
gan teammates.
"A lot of the guys like it so
they've helped us get it out there
and promote," Kennedy said.
"The response has been more
than I could have expected."
"I'm a fan," Demens said.
"Those guys are talented."

7.6 magnitude earthquake
shakes part of Costa Rica

Bridge, houses
collapes in wake of
natural disaster
CANGREJAL, Costa Rica
(AP) - A powerful magnitude-7.6
earthquake shook Costa Rica and
neighboring countries Wednes-
day, sending panicked people into
the streets and briefly triggering
a tsunami alert, but causing little
damage. Authorities reported
one confirmed death.
"When we felt the earthquake,
we held onto each other because
we kept falling," said Rosa Pich-
ardo, 45, who was walking on the
beach in the town of Samara with
her family when the quake hit.
"I've never felt anything like
this. We just couldn't stay stand-
ing. My feet gave out udder me. It
was terrible, terrible," she said.
Officials said the quake col-
lapsed some houses and at least.
one bridge and caused landslides
that blocked highways. But Costa.
WEST NILE
From Page 1A
they aren't able to offer a conclu-
sive answer for why there have
been so many West Nile cases
this year.
JoLynn Montgomery, an assis-
tant research scientist of epide-
miology at the School of Public
Health, said the mosquitoes car-
rying the virus may have ben-
efitted from irregular seasonal
conditions earlier this year. .
"It's likely that we had a pret-
ty mild winter here in Michigan
and more of the mosquitoes that
were carrying the virus were
able to survive over winter,"
Montgomery said.
There is no vaccine or sub-
stantive treatment for those
infected with the virus, Mont-
gomery said. However, she said
alternative care methods aimed
at restoring hydration can help
relieve many symptoms.
Wilson said only a small per-
centage of infected people -
about 20 percent of cases - have
severe reactions to the virus, and

Rica President Laura Chinchilla
said there were no reports of
major damage and called for
calm.
Residents described being
shocked by the force of the quake,
which was felt as far away as
Panama and Nicaragua and was
the biggest since a 7.6-magnitude
quake in 1991 left 47 people dead.
Michelle Landwer, owner of
the Belvedere Hotel in Samara,
north of the epicenter, said she
was having breakfast with about
10 people when the quake hit.
"The whole building was mov-
ing, I couldn't even walk," Land-
wer said."Everything was falling,
like glasses and everything." Still,
she added, "Here in my building
there was no real damage."
The quake was somewhat
deep - 25 miles (41 kilometers)
below the surface. Quakes that
occur deeper underground tend
to be less damaging, but more
widely felt.
"If it was a shallower event, it
would be a significantly higher
diagnosed experience "mild flu-
like symptoms."
Sandro Cinti, an associate
professor at the Medical School,
said the extent of how dangerous
West Nile is may be exaggerated,
noting that those who have seri-
ous reactions are often already
coping with weakened immune
systems.
"You see people in the hospital
and they are really sick, but they
are the susceptible ones," Wilson
said.
He added that the mortality
rate for those who suffer from
neurological symptoms is 10 to
15 percent, but this number is
still small compared to the num-
ber of cases in which patients
have mild symptoms or the virus
goes undetected.
"If you compare influenza
deaths (nationally), they are,
about 35,000 to 40,000 on an
average year,' Cinti said. "West
Nile at its best ..:is 200 to 300."
Cinti said the best way to
protect against the disease is to
stay inside in the evenings and
early mornings and to wear long-
sleeved shirts and pants when-

hazard," said seismologist Daniel
McNamara of the U.S. Geological
Survey.
The U.S. Geological Survey
said the quake was centered
about 38 miles (60 kilometers)
from the town of Liberia and 87
miles (140 kilometers) west of the
capital, San Jose. The magnitude
initially was estimated at 7.9, but
was quickly downgraded to 7.6.
The area is a seismically active
zone where the Cocos tectonic
plate dives beneath the Carib-
bean plate. "All along the Pacific
coast of Central America, you can
expect fairly big earthquakes,"
McNamara said.
The quake was followed by
three strong aftershocks of mag-

CTOOLS
From Page1A
To ensure that users under-
stand and fully utilize the new
tools, ITS has held faculty work-
shops, interactive webinars,
and additional help resources
about CTools will continue to be
offered throughout the year.
DeMonner added that the
staff is constantly working to
develop new tools and applica-
tions for CTools.
"Our goal is to continue to
increase and enhance the func-
tionality of CTools by integrat-
ing more external tools and
making CTools serve as a sort of
hub for access to many applica-
tions and services," DeMonner

said.
LSA freshman Tyler Ryder
said he noticed the Aug. 4 chang-
es to CTools while taking sum-.
mer courses at the University.
"I feel like it will help," Ryder
said. "It will be a time-saver and
it will also be a stress reliever."
Ryder added that he thinks
the Piazza forum will allow
for more personal interaction
between students and instruc-
tors.
"It puts you more on a one-
on-one basis with your profes-
sor, and keeps you closer," Ryder
said. "It's almost like going back
to high school again, where you
can actually sit and talk to your
professor even if it is a big lec-
ture."
Hayley Knouff, an LSA sopho-

more, said she doesn't know how
to fully utilize CTools and would
like to learn more aboutthe tools
that are available to her.
"I think they really do need to
spend a little more time show-
ing us how to use it because it's
a really good resource to orga-
nize," Knouff said. "I will proba-
bly go home and explore and see
what new things are on there."
LSA sophomore Zainab
Masood said she has assign-
ments due on Piazza and is
uncomfortable with the tool's
lack of privacy.
"I don't like that what I have
to say is going to be seen by
everybody," Masood said. "I
guess it's incentive to work
harder and make what you say
sound good."

where; they're not going to

them they're not just going to

to be aware that they are just
like us and that they deserve to
be here." ,
Jose Franco - an undoc-
umented immigrant and
founder of One Michigan, a
Detroit-based organization of
young immigrants fighting for
equal rights - said he hopes the
new deferred action policy will
eventually lead to adoption of
the DREAM Act.
"I think it's a great step for-
ward, but people are still being
deported and hopefully this
leads to the DREAM Act pass-
ing," Franco said.
Under the new policy, Franco
said undocumented students
are able to go to a non-profit
organization or an immigra-
tion lawyer with the necessary
paperwork to complete and
send an application.
After receiving a permit, the
student then must overcome the
hurdle of paying for tuition.
Statewide organizations
such as One Michigan and pro-
grams like the Coalition for
Tuition Equality in Ann Arbor
have continued to work toward
extending in-state tuition to
undocumented immigrants in

Michigan.
Public Policy senior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, the founder of
CTE, said the organization
strives to increase accessibility
to higher education for undocu-
mented students in the state.
"Our expressed mission is to
make the University of Michi-
gan more accessible to undocu-
mented students and that means
making University education
more affordable in practical
terms," Mersol-Barg said.
The deferred action policy
is a federal order and therefore
does not impact individual state
policies, meaning that undocu-
mented immigrants interested
in applying to the University of
Michigan still cannot receive
financial aid or the benefit of in-
state tuition.
"For the most part, even
though (the policy) solidifies
itself with the federal govern-
ment, in terms of participation
and social service programs or
access to in-state tuitions, all
those are primarily state mat-
ters," Garcia said.
Although the deferred action
policy is temporary, making it
difficult to implement perma-
nent policy changes at the Uni-
versity level, Mersol-Barg said
he believes it is still a move in
the right direction.
"Any help is good help,"
Mersol-Barg said. "Any way for
them to gain employment, a
social security nutber, a driv-
er's license. These are all key
things that they can earn an
income off of, so that they can
live a dignified life. Even though
most of them have to live in the
shadows ... this is a step forward
that they can take part in more
aspects of society."

Three of four
measures to appear
on ballot
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
(AP) - The Michigan Supreme
Court ruled Wednesday that
voters should decide whether to
strengthen collective bargain-
ing rights, allow construction of
bridges and tunnels to Canada,
and require a supermajority in
the Legislature to raise taxes.
The state's highest court
approved the three proposals
for the Nov. 6 election ballot but
rejected a fourth measure that
would have authorized con-
struction of eight more casinos.
Justices disqualified the casino
proposal because it failed to dis-
close that it would weaken the
state Liquor Control Commis-
sion's authority.
Opponents challenged the
proposed initiatives in court after
the State Board of Canvassers
repeatedly deadlocked on parti-
san lines over whether to place
the measures on the ballot.
Each of them would amend the
Michigan Constitution. The issue
before the court was whether the
measures would repeal or change
existing constitutional provisions
and, if so, whether their wording
made those changes clear.
In an opinion written by Jus-
tice Brian K. Zahra, the seven-
member court unanimously
found that the collective bar-
gaining, bridge construction and
tax increase measures would not
"add to, delete from or change"

wording in the constitution, nor
would they prevent existing pro-
visions from being carried out.
The ruling against the casino
proposal was decided by a 4-3
majority.
The decision means the state's
voterswill decide the contentious
issue of whether to build a new
bridge across the Detroit River
between Detroit and Windsor,
Ontario. Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder and many business inter-
ests favor the project, but it has
failed to gain approval in the
GOP-controlled Legislature.
Owners of the Ambassador
Bridge, who say they would suf-
fer a competitive disadvantage if
the new bridge were built, have
sponsored a statewide television
ad blitz againstit.
Mickey Blashfield, spokesman
for a group called The People
Should Decide that sponsored
the initiative, said the court's
decision was "a victory for the
more than 600,000 voters who
signed our petition and for all
Michiganders who want a say
in how public money is spent on
international crossings."
A group called Protect Our
Jobs has championed the mea-
sure that would guarantee col-
lective bargaining rights.
"Corporate special interests
have spent millions and will
'spend millions more to mislead
voters and silence our voice to
negotiate for fair wages, ben-
efits and working conditions that
benefit us all," Cheryl Weston, a
nurse at McLaren Lapeer Region
Medical Center, said in a state-
ment issued by the group.

ADMISSION
From Page 1A
versity has been adjusting its
budget to better provide finan-
cial aid to students in need, espe-
cially in light of recent tuition
increases.
The University's Board of
Regents voted on a 2.8 percent
tuition increase for in-state stu-
dents and 3.5 for out-of-state stu-
dents for the 2012-2013 academic
year in. June. Though there has
been an uptick in prices, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
said the University has strived to
compensate for the extra cost
with additional financial guid-
ance.
"For four straight years now,
we have presented a financial
aid budget that covers the full
increase in tuition for our needi-
est students," Coleman said at
the June regents meeting. "This
year's increase in financial aid

with bathrooms and appliances
such as washers and dryers in
each room.
The rooms, which are
equipped with 60" HD TVs, Blue
Ray players and full furnishings,
start at $750 per month for a
single room, and a single loft unit
with a private study area can cost
up to $1,200 per month, Helmin-
ski said.
ZARAGON WEST
OFFERS ITALIAN-STYLE
RESTAURANT, PRIVATE
GYM TO TENANTS
The sister complex to Zaragon
Place, Zaragon West, located on
Thompson Street, also opened
last month.
Nicknamed ZW, the rent
expense of the luxury complex
exceeds most other apartments
in the city. A one-bedroom unit,
shared between two tenants,
costs $750 per month per person,
double the cost of a single room
in City Place.
In a joint phone interview on
Aug. 27, Richard Perlman, ZW
president, and Lisa Miner, exec-
utive vice president of Zaragon,
Inc., said the company strives to
create environmentally friendly
and comfortable living environ-
ments across campus.
In addition to the amenities
of the fitness center located on
the first floor and the attached
indoor parking complex, Zara-
gon West has leased first-floor
space to NeoPapalis, an Italian
style restaurant.
Perlman said the restaurant
will "have a very contemporary,
European feel."
The restaurant will serve Nea-
politan pizzas, pita sandwiches
and salads, all made-to-order,
according to Angelo Linardakis,
general manager of the restau-
rant. A full-service bar, owned
by popular Detroit restaurant
PizzaPapalis, will also add to the
lively atmosphere.
The restaurant is scheduled to
open the first week of October,
with prices for a base pizza start-
ing at $7, and sandwiches and
salads at $5.
LSA sophomore Arsh Patel,

a ZW resident, said the current
construction on the restaurant
g has been an issue since he moved

will come in the form of grants,
not loans, which helps reduce
(the) student debt burden."
Despite the record number
of applications, Hanlon said the
surplus of freshmen will not be
difficult to accommodate, as the
University accepted fewer stu-
dents than last year in order to
avoid significantly exceeding its
enrollment goal. For the 2011-
2012 academic year, 6, 251 stu-
dents were accepted, about 251
more than this year.
. Ted Spencer, the associate
vice provost and executive direc-
tor of undergraduate admissions,
said the University's move to the
Common Application in 2010
has led to a continual increase
'in the number of applications
each year. According to Spencer,
the University received applica-
tions from 5,000 high schools
last year, and the number of
out-of-state applicants has also
increased significantly.
Spencer added that the Uni-

versity has been increasing its
recruiting efforts in areas of the
country that are underrepresent-
ed, which has expanded applica-
tions.
Case, the Engineering student,
said she applied to the University
because of the esteemed reputa-
tion of the College of Engineer-
ing, though she wasn't sure she'd
receive an acceptance letter.
"I didn't really know what I
wanted to do. I thought I wanted-
to be an engineer so I applied to
schools that had good engineer-
ing programs,"- Case said. "I
applied (to Michigan) to see if I
could get in."
Though she is the only student
from her graduatingclass attend-.
ing the University, Case said she
is excited to start her freshman
year among the newly enrolled,
and the Ann Arbor environment
has already put her at ease.

las which is all concrete," Case

"One thing that has been a
problem for a lot of us is the drill-
ing that's going on in the restau-
rant downstairs," Patel said.
"We've asked about it and man-
agement said it should be done
soon. It's just pretty loud."
Patel, who lives in a single-
unit room, said he chose to live at
ZW for its proximity to campus,
and he's enjoyed the short walk
to class as well as the building
amenities..
"Moving in, my initial reac-
tion was exactly how it was pic-
tured on the website. I go to the
gym every day. It's the perfect
size, never packed," Patel said.
LANDMARK WELCOMES
600 RESIDENTS TO SOUTH
UNIVERSITY AREA
The most recently completed
of the three new complexes,
Landmark, opened its doors to
600 residents on Aug. 30.
The facilities featured in Land-
mark include a fitness center,
a screening room, conference
rooms and an outdoor patio space.
Though the apartments have been
completed, the common
areas still require another
2-4 weeks' of construc-
tion before resident use
according to Nick Hill,
Landmark property man-
ager.
Campus Acquisitions,
the parent developer of
the Landmark building,
spans across 14 campuses
nationwide and the Ann
Arbor location is the first
to arrive in Michigan. It
is also the largest of all CA
projects.
According to Land-
mark'swebsite, the cheap-
est unit - a six-bedroom
apartment - costs $989
per person, per month
to rent. Hill is adamant
about residents utilizing
the common facilities in
the building to create a
welcoming environment.
"We've got a broad
range of social and aca-
demic amenities," Hill
said. "We want to estab-
lish dorm-like camarade-
rie."
As a means to foster
a community lifestyle,
Landmark has developed
a guest management

smart phone application for resi-
dents to check-in theirguests.
"We believe that with 600 resi-
dents, at times with three to four
friends over, we want to balance
the line between convenience and
safety, but safety trumps our con-
cerns," Hill said.
LSA sophomore, Atessa
Lubischer, a Landmark commu-
nity assistant, explained that after
living on North Campus during
her first year at the University, she
has high hopes for the Landmark
experience.
"The modern furnishings and
amenities allow for a great social
environment," Lubischer said.
"I also wanted to sign at a place I
could call home."
Business junior Amit Desh-
pande said he's enjoyed the loca-
tion of Landmark, but his room
size was surprising.
"The rooms were much.small-
er than expected," Deshpande
said. "There is very minimal
storage because the rooms are so
small. They could have made bet-
ter use of the storage by making
the under-bed closet narrower,
but taller so that you can put
more stuff under the bed."

Positions on Israel,
religion, unclear
at convention in
North Carolina
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -
Needled by Mitt Romney and
other Republicans, Democrats
hurriedly rewrote their con-
vention platform Wednesday
to add a mention of God and
declare Jerusalem the capital
of Israel after President Barack
Obama intervened to order the
changes.
The embarrassing reversal
was compounded by chaos and
uncertainty on the convention
floor. Three times Los Ange-
les Mayor Antonio Villaraigo-
sa, the convention chairman,
called for a voice vote on the
changes and each time the yes
and no votes seemed to balance
each other out. On the third
attempt, Villaraigosa ruled the
amendments were approved -
triggering boos from many in
the audience.
The episode exposed ten;
sions on Israel within the party,
put Democrats on the defensive
and created a public relations
spectacle as Obama arrived in
the convention city to claim his
party's nomination fora second
term.
"There was no discussion.
We didn't even see it coming.
We were blindsided by it," said
Noor Ul-Hasan, a Muslim del-
egate from Salt Lake City, who
questioned whether the con-
vention hadenough ofaquorum
to even amend the platform.
"The majority spoke last
night," said Angela Urrea, a
delegate from Roy, Utah. "We
shouldn't be declaringJerusa-
lem as the capital of Israel."
The language in the platform

- a political document - does
not affect actual U.S. policy
toward Israel. The administra-
tion has long said that deter-
mining Jerusalem's status is an
issue that should be decided in
peace talks by Israelis and Pal-
estinians.
The American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, the power-
ful pro-Israel lobbying group,
welcomed the support of Dem-
ocrats and Republicans alike on
Israel. "Together, these party
platforms reflect strong bipar-
tisan support for the US-Israel
relationship," AIPAC said.
Obama intervened directly
to get the language changed
both on Jerusalem and to
reinstate God in the platform,
according to campaign officials
vyho insisted on anonymity to
describe behind-the-scenes
party negotiations. They said
Obama's reaction to the omis-
sion of God from the platform
was to wonder why it was
removed in the first place.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman
Schultz, D-Fla., the party
chairman, said both the God
and Jerusalem omissions were
"essentially a technical over-
sight." She insisted in a CNN
interview there had been no
discord on the floor and said
the vote definitely met the two-
thirds threshold.
The revisions came as
Obama struggles to win sup-
port from white working-class
voters, many of whom have
strong religious beliefs, and as
Republicans try to woo Jewish
voters and contributors away
from theDemocratic Party.
Republicans claimed the plat-
form omissions suggested
Obama was weak in his defense
of Israel and out of touch with
mainstream Americans.
GOP officials argued that
not taking a position on Jeru-

salem's status in the party plat-
form raised questions about
Obama's support for the Mid-
east ally. Romney said omitting
God "suggests a party that is
increasingly out of touch with
the mainstream of the Ameri-
can people."
"I think this party is veering
further and further away into
an extreme wing that Ameri-
cans don't recognize," Romney
said.
Added to the Democratic
platform was a declaration that
Jerusalem "is and will remain
the capital of Israel. The parties
have agreed that Jerusalem is a
matter for final status negotia-
tions. It should remain an undi-
vided city accessible to people
of all faiths."
That language was includ-
ed in the platform four years
ago when Obama ran for his
first term, but was left out
when Democrats on Tuesday
approved their 2012 platform,
which referred only to the
nation's "unshakable commit-
ment to Israel's security."
Also restored from the 2008
platform was language calling
for a government that "gives
everyone willing to work hard
the chance to make the most of
their God-given potential."
For decades, ' Republican
and Democratic administra-
tions alike have said it is up
to the Israelis and Palestin-
ians to settle Jerusalem's final
status - a position reiter-
ated earlier Wednesday bythe
White House. Both sides claim
Jerusalem as their capital, and
the city's status has-long been
among the thorniest issues in
Mideast peace talks.
The U.S. has its embassy in
Tel Aviv, although numerous
Republicans - including Mitt
Romney - have vowed to move
the embassy to Jerusalem.

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"Red"
Mark Rothko is afraid that the black will one
day overtake the red. So goes the abstract theme
of "Red", which focuses on the later days of the
painter Rothko, who helped popularize the
abstract expressionist movement. Knowledge of
art history isn't required to enjoy this show. If you
like smart dialogue and diatribes about the power
of art, thenyou should make a date to see "Red".
CENTER THEATRE GROUP
Tigermilk

When the change that comeswrth a new school
year becomes too dizzying to bear, there's noth-
ing like tuning out the hectic world and grounding
B Byourself with something familiar. Belle & Sebas-
tian's Tigermilk is worth dusting off and giving a
listen - it's sometimes peppy, sometimes sad, but
ELETTR T Hasty always warm and welcoming like a longtime friend.
"Detention"
"The Breakfast Club" was an excellent movie,
- but there's no doubt a couple of additions could've
transformed the film. Like, don't you wish it had
moretime-travelingbears? Masked slasherkillers?
Josh Hutcherson? Mother-daughter brain switch-
es? "Detention" may seem like an average heartfelt
high-school prom tale, but ends up being an unpre-
dictably satiric romp through adolescent tropes.
SONY Cancel your future, see "Detention." .
"Revolution"
Of the new series in the works, "Revolution" is
perhaps the most-anticipated pilot to debut this
September. After all the "Hunger Games" hul-
laballoo, a dystopian, end-of-the-world-as-we-
know-it, new show might be just the thing to grab
attention, but with J.J. Abrams at the helm, the
' trick will be.holding that attention. Check out an
advance viewing of the pilot on NBC.com, or catch

A comlete Shakespearean immersion

English Prof. Linda
Gregerson finds
inspiration in past
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
At the Michigan Renaissance
Festival, you can time-travel.
You can watch jousts, drink ale
from a wooden mug and don
your very best jester apparel, all
while speaking in a fake British
accent. Call it nostalgic; call it
escapist; call it just plain weird.
Whatever you call it, the Renais-
sance's influence has endured, if
you know where to look.
But to renowned poet and
Shakespearean professor Linda
Gregerson, you don't need to
look far.
"What was remarkable about
Shakespeare (was his) real genius
for the small moment, for the
eccentric detail, that told you a
world of things that summoned
up a very rich background, what
we call depths," she said.
These small details have had
"an incalculable influence on
every medium, every sort of sto-
rytelling and representational
medium."
Gregerson has felt the influ-
ence of the Bard and his contem-
poraries in her own writing.
"(There are) some things
(that) I consider breakthroughs
in mode. It's about syntax; it's
about the way they wrote poetic
line," she said. "Those are broad-
er lessons, or in some instances,
technical lessons that I feel have
influenced my own writing."
As a poet, what Gregerson
values most from Shakespeare's
era is "open voicing," her own
term. It's a technique used often
in Shakespeare's sonnets that

Gregerson's 2007 book of poems "Magnetic North" was a finalist for the National Book Award for Poetry.

began with the poems of Sir
Thomas Wyatt, she said. Open
voicing cultivates a "quasi-dra-
matic voice in the lyric poem"
with a persona entirely its own.
The key characteristic includes a
colloquial tone, "subject to lapses
and interruption."
This is perhaps what made
Gregerson's collection of poems,
"Magnetic North," a 2007 final-
ist for the National Book Award
for Poetry. Kathryn Crim of the
Boston Review praised it as "an
effort to achieve an even greater
intellectual and spiritual depth,
to refresh us to the poet's vision
of a difficult world."
"Gregerson's meticulous atten-
tion to syntax and rhythm and
shape expose her anxieties and
attend to them, straining the lines
to chart the way she has been lis-
tening, watching, pondering,"
Crim wrote.
While Gregerson said she's
been influenced by the Renais-

sance writers, her poems often
thrive off of her own inspiration.
Take "Make-Falcon" - writ-
ten entirely in free-verse; not a
style for which Shakespeare'was
known.
Yet even after numerous
awards and accolades including
a Guggenheim Fellowship, Gre-
gerson still finds joy in teaching
what she calls "the most inter-
esting literary and cultural peri-
od." As a Renaissance scholar,
she expects her students to not
only read the texts of this period,
but also to understand the con-
text from when the works were
written.
"I want it to be palpable and
real and exciting and vivid for my
students," she said.
Citing the epic poem "The
Faerie Queene," Gregerson
explained that, while jousting is
a central theme to the poem, this
Renaissance phenomenon was
actually a medieval practice.

"That was a fashion in the
Renaissance," she said. "They
were reaching back into the past
partly out of nostalgia. It was a
form of nationalist celebration
and forms of self-promotion."
So after teaching Renaissance
literature at the University since
1987, is she ever surprised by any
student's interpretations of the
"Soul of the Age?"
"Always. Always," she insisted.
"And that's why it's enormous
fun to teach Shakespeare. They
are such bountiful texts and I'm
always surprised by something. I
always learn somethingnew from
my students."
But not everyone feels the
same way. For some, Shake-
speare is the ultimate test of lit-
eracy and humanity; for others
- patience. Leo Tolstoy famously
said after reading Shakespeare,
"Not only did I feel no delight,
but I felt an irresistible repulsion
and tedium." ,Resistant to nay-

sayers, Gregerson is encourag-
ing of skeptic, new and well-read
students alike.
"I hope they find things that
delight them and enlarge their
world," she said. "What I hope is
that the college classroom would
be a site for discovering again
the pleasures of this literature,
the pleasures of thinking about
something that is not right in
front of you on the page."
Whenever possible, she push-
es her students to "try their hand
at performance." And if a Shake-
speare company is in the area,
she takes classes to performanc-
es, and even invites members
from the company to visit class.
"One of the best presentations
in class was done by a stage man-
ager who showed others what
stage managers do and how they
approach the script... It was won-
derful," she said.
Though it's doubtful that most
who attend an event like the

Renaissance Festival are think-
ing of Shakespearean syntax
while watching jousts, Greger-
son still believes festival-goers
are "very much in the spirit of
popular entertainment in Shake-
speare's own period."
"There simply were not the
hard lines drawn between 'audi-
ence' and 'performers' that we
have seen so often in more formal
entertainments of subsequent
eras," she said.
She considers the participatory
quality of the Renaissance the-
ater to be its great genius. Their
stage - whether it was the Globe
Theater or the streets of London
- extended performers' "festive
hospitality" to the audience, she
said.
Maybe this is what festival-
goers seek and what Gregerson
hopes her students to attain: a
kind of time travel, total immer-
sion in another period - if only
until the final blue-book exam.
