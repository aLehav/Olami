Higher 
education 
reform 

has been a hot topic this 
election season — particularly 
for Democrats. As opponents 
in the Democratic primary, 
now-Democratic 
presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton 

and 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders 

(D–VT) 
lauded 
their 
two 

separate proposals of debt-
free and tuition-free college, 
respectively.

Several 
states 
already 

offer free college plans at 
certain institutions including 
Maryland, New York, Colorado, 
Connecticut, 
California, 

Pennsylvania, 
Missouri 
and 

Kentucky. However, no such 
plans have come into fruition in 
the state of Michigan.

As the current system stands, 

students must take out loans 
or receive grants on a federal 
level. With higher education 
reform, the overarching plans 
come from the national level, 
but state support would still be 
required, particularly from the 
governor’s office, if they were to 
be fully implemented.

In Michigan, it is unclear how 

gubernatorial support would 
play out. In 2011, Gov. Rick 
Snyder cut state funding for 
higher education by 15 percent, 
on 
trend 
with 
decreasing 

support for higher education 
during 
several 
years 
prior. 

Snyder’s office did not respond 
to request for comment on his 
administration’s willingness to 

work toward debt-free plans.

Nonetheless, 
after 
2018, 

Snyder will no longer be in office 
due to term limits. Depending 
on 
when 
higher 
education 

reform is implemented, the 
state may be under different 
leadership. Additionally, lack of 
state support does not translate 
into lack of support from voters.

Debt Free vs. Tuition Free
In the primaries, Sanders 

saw 
massive 
support 
from 

students and young people, 
many of whom viewed his 
higher 
education 
plan 
as 

the best for their needs. In 
July, after Clinton became 

the presumptive Democratic 
nominee, 
the 
two 
worked 

together to expand Clinton’s 
New College Compact so that it 
encompassed more of Sanders’ 
ideas, including making tuition 
at public colleges free for 
students with families who earn 
less than $125,000 per year.

Clinton’s debt-free plan as 

it stands now promises that all 
students will be able to graduate 
from a public institution within 
their state without taking out 
loans for tuition, books or fees. 
This guarantee requires that 
students contribute by way of 
at least 10 hours of earnings per 

work week and their families 
make a reasonable contribution 
based on income.

Sanders’ plan was largely 

similar to Clinton’s, however, it 
went further in order to allow 
public universities to be tuition 
free for all in-state students. 
Even after Sanders’ departure 
from the presidential race and 
Clinton’s sizable expansion of 
her college plan, some of those 
whose votes were influenced by 
higher education reform are not 
fully satisfied.

Collin Kelly, the chair of the 

Republican 
presidential 

nominee Donald Trump visited 
Michigan for the second time 
this month Wednesday, when 
he toured a water treatment 
facility in Flint. During the trip, 
Trump also visited Bethel United 
Methodist Church and met with 
Rev. Faith Green Timmons and 
other community members.

Trump’s trip to Flint — a 

primarily Black community which 
was affected by a major public 
health crisis after its water supply 
was contaminated with lead in 
2015 — follows a recent theme in 
his campaign of attempts to reach 
out to minority voters. In his Sept. 
3 visit to Detroit, he attended 
a gathering at a Black church 
and was interviewed by Bishop 
Wayne T. Jackson, the Great 
Faith 
Ministries 
International 

congregation leader.

Even before he made it to 

Flint Wednesday, however, some 
residents were not enthused. 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver — 
who has endorsed Democratic 
nominee Hillary Clinton — did 
not encourage the visit, charging 
that Trump did not reach out to

Starting in the fall 2017 

semester, the Ross School of 
Business will no longer offer 
the 
option 
for 
prospective 

undergraduate students to apply 
through a regular admissions 
process after they’ve already 
enrolled at the University of 
Michigan.

Instead, applicants will have 

the option of applying through 
the preferred admissions process 
as high school seniors or through 
the normal transfer application 
process for students already 
studying at the University of 
Michigan or at other college 

institutions.

According to the Ross website, 

under the new system 500 
students will be admitted to Ross 
as high school students and enroll 
during the first semester of their 
sophomore year through the 
preferred admissions application 
following 
the 
Fall 
semester 

of 2017. This pre-admissions 
system, which currently accounts 
for roughly 20 percent of Ross 
students is slated to increase 
exponentially to 80 percent of 
all students per year once the 
regular admissions application is 
replaced.

The State Theater sits closed Wednesday as it prepares for months-long renovations.

After nearly being converted 

into office space, the State 
Theatre and all of its art deco 
grandeur 
will 
be 
properly 

restored and renovated over 
the next eight to 12 months 

in order to better serve the 
community, right on time for 
its 75th anniversary in 2017. In 
the meantime, the theater will 
be closed. Renovations began 
Tuesday.

The 
State 
Theatre 
was 

purchased by the Michigan 
Theater in 2014 to preserve 

and protect Ann Arbor’s movie 
exhibition business, and has 
been dedicated to showing art-
house films since. The theater 
is renowned for its high-style 
art 
deco 
cinema, 
designed 

by C. Howard Crane in 1942 
and 
Crane’s 
facade, 
classic 

marquee, entrance and lobby, 

as well as the restrooms, are 
parts of the restoration efforts 
to come. The restoration will be 
funded by a capital campaign 
the State and Michigan project, 
operated 
by 
the 
Michigan 

Theater Foundation.

For the first time in more than 

three decades, a new school is 
in the works for the University 
of Michigan. The new college, 
suggested 
tentatively 
named 

the School of Sustainability, 
Environment and Society, would 
replace the School of Natural 
Resources and the Environment. 
Modifications to the Program 
in the Environment and the 
Graham Sustainability Institute 
are slated to take place within 
the next year.

In fall 2015, University Provost 

Martha Pollack asked an external 
review committee to evaluate 
the University’s programs in 
sustainability, leading to the 
current plan for a new school.

James Holloway, vice provost 

for 
Global 
Engagement 
and 

Interdisciplinary 
Academic 

Affairs, 
said 
the 
external 

committee 
found 
there 
is 

greater 
opportunity 
for 
the 

University to lead in the field 
of sustainability by bringing 
together 
and 
integrating 
its 

major sustainability programs.

Michigan’s 
legislature 

is taking the next step to 
ensure that the state remains 
at the forefront of driverless 
car research. Last week, the 
Michigan Senate approved four 
bills looking to push forward 
autonomous vehicle research in 
the state.

The 
package 
now 
moves 

from the Republican-controlled 
Senate, 
where 
it 
has 
been 

approved, to the House. The bill 
will allow for testing of the cars 
on 122 miles of roads throughout 
the state. If passed, the bill will 
also allow for the American 
Center for Mobility to redevelop 
the Willow Run Airport for more 
autonomous vehicle testing and 
research.

“This opens everything — as 

long as you have everything 
working and you pass all the 
standards that we set forward,” 
Sen. Mike Kowall (R–White 

Lake), one of the bill’s sponsors, 
told the Detroit Free Press.

Michigan is actively pushing 

to 
stay 
the 
top 
state 
for 

autonomous driving competing 
with states such as Florida, 
Arizona and California, also 
centers of development for self-
driving cars. Michigan is one 
of only seven states that allows 
testing autonomous cars in a 
public setting.

Along with other research 

facilities strewn across the state, 
the University of Michigan has 
large stakes in this research 
as the host of Mcity: 32 acres 
on North Campus dedicated 
to testing the capabilities of 
driverless cars in association 
with the Michigan Department 
of Transportation. 

Mcity 
opened 
in 
July 

2015 
in 
collaboration 
with 

the 
University’s 
Mobility 

Transformation Center. The site 
is currently lead by corporate 
partners such as Ford, Toyota, 

State Farm Mutual Automobile 
Insurance and General Motors. 
It operates as a real-life setting 
for engineers to test and make 
their way toward completely 
autonomous cars. Engineers are 
currently working on a series 
of projects aimed at connecting 
cars to each other and to 
their environment. The new 
legislation has the potential to 
change the purpose and inner-
workings of Mcity as research is 
moved beyond the “lab” and into 
a real world setting.

However, 
the 
recent 

legislation has also garnered 
opposition from tech giants like 
Google. Google is now contesting 
the recent legislation, charging 
that the language of the bills 
exclude 
companies 
such 
as 

Google that are new to making 
cars.

An MCity representative was 

unable to comment on the recent 
legislation.

As part of an almost $3 million 

grant from the National Science 

Foundation, Nancy Love, University 

of Michigan professor of civil and 

environmental engineering, and her 

team of researchers will be installing 

special waterless urinals and “source-

separating” flush toilets in the G.G. 

Brown building on North Campus 

to direct all urine to a holding tank. 

The urine will eventually be used as 

fertilizer in the Matthaei Botanical 

Gardens.

“We believe our work will take 

urine-derived fertilizer to a point 

where it’s safer than synthetic 

fertilizers and biosolids,” Love wrote 

in a press release.

Love said the project is the largest 

endeavor to explore the technology, 

systems requirements and social 

attitudes associated with urine-

derived fertilizers.

According to the press release, the 

technological innovation is the biggest 

challenge the team will face, as the 

team has doubts as to whether or not 

people will want to use fertilizer that 

comes from urine.

“We can throw all the technology 

in the world at this problem and make 

no progress towards implementation 

unless the second area is advanced — 

and that’s the social behavior piece,” 

Love wrote in a press release. “We’re 

investigating the attitudes people 

hold towards the use of urine-derived 

fertilizers and will be testing and 

evaluating educational interventions.”

Rebecca Hardin, associate 

professor in the School of Natural 

Resources and Environment and 

researcher for the project, said while 

the research team is made up of grad 

students and professors, the origin 

of the project can be traced back to 

undergraduates.

“The project arose, in part, 

through the dialogue fostered by a 

student driven forum,” the digital 

media platform ‘It’s Hot in Here,’ ” 

Hardin said. “A podcast produced 

over a year ago now was the first 

conversation about the potential of this 

project.”

Wednesday.

excellence at the Business School, 
emphasized in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily that the 
purpose of the change is to admit 
more students to Ross who have a 
demonstrated interest and talent 
for business through the pre-
admissions system.

“Currently 
business 
is 
the 

number 
one 
intended 
major 

for students coming out of high 
school,” Wooten said. “Because of 
the high demand, more students 
are looking to be accepted before 
their freshman years at college. 
Therefore, in trying to eliminate the 
barrier for students to get into the 
business school, this change will 
give more students an opportunity 
to know if they will become Ross 
students right out of high school.”

This shift in admissions policy 

is, in part, designed to resemble 
admissions at other elite business 
schools such as Indiana University 
and University of North Carolina — 

something that some Ross students, 
like Business sophomore Arjun 
Prakash, welcomed.

“I think it will make us more 

competitive against those schools 
especially.” Prakash, who was a 
pre-admit, wrote in an email. “If 
a student has an assured seat in 
the business program at, say, NYU 
Stern, he/she may not want to risk 
enrolling at Michigan with the 
chance of not getting admitted to 
Ross as a sophomore. I think the 
move will cause the university’s 
yield as a whole to increase, since 
students can choose Michigan with 
the full confidence that they will be 
studying the major they want.”

In the past two years, Ross has 

already begun to expand their 
preferred admissions enrollment 
from 181 students in 2015 to 261 
students in 2016. This change has 
also coincided with an expansion 
in class size from 580 students 
to 625 students between 2015 
and 2016. Meanwhile, external 
transfer students accounted for 1% 
of incoming students in 2015. The 
other 473 were accepted through 

the regular admissions process.

Despite the increase in the 

number of pre-admits, the Business 
School will still be aiming to add 
100 transfer students each year 
to the incoming class who are 
transferring from other colleges 
at the University, according to 
Wooten. 

Wooten 
also 
pointed 
to 

the 
importance 
of 
fostering 

academic diversity within the 
BBA program, emphasizing the 
need for individuals who have 
complimentary academic interests 
outside of business, as a benefit of 
increasing pre-admission.

“By increasing the number of 

pre-admits, most of our incoming 
students will not have the concerns 
about being accepted and will feel 
more free to pursue different 
academic interests, not just what 
they think we want to see,” Wooten 
said. “And this is something that is 
very important to us; we want all 
of our students to be exploratory 
learners since we do consider Ross 
to be a liberal arts business school.”

Prakash 
echoed 
Wooten’s 

sentiments, writing that he agreed 
that the preadmission program 
enables academic freedom during 
their freshman year.

“Having the safety net of 

being a preferred admit certainly 
helped my general morale of 
being a freshman that wanted 
to 
study 
business.” 
Prakash 

wrote. “It allowed me to focus on 
extracurriculars 
and 
academic 

classes for my long-term benefit 
rather 
than 
a 
short-term 

admissions gain. I wasn’t afraid 
to take challenging computer 
science classes at the expense of 
lowering my GPA, and I strived for 
leadership because I really wanted 
it.”

While 
the 
current 
regular 

admissions 
application 
mainly 

focuses on academic achievement 
in 
college, 
the 
preferred 

admissions application is designed 
to showcase student affinity and 
interest in business fields.

director 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Theater, said pledges to fund 
the restoration currently total 
$6.2 million out of the $8.5 
million needed to complete 
the campaign, with most of the 
funds coming from donations 
by private citizens. 

“We’re 
about 
halfway 

through the project,” Collins 
said. 
“We’ve 
raised 
about 

three quarters of the total 
needed 
to 
complete 
the 

project. The last two million 
will be toughest to raise. The 
vast majority of it (donations) 
are from private citizens and 
local foundations.”

Renovations officially began 

Tuesday, following a special 
event with donors and members 
of the Michigan Theater, the 
State and Michigan Project 
leadership 
committee 
— 

headed by co-chairs Judy Dow 
Rumelhart and Ambassador 
Ronald N. Weiser — campaign 
co-chairs Martha Darling and 
Gil Omenn and Ann Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor, 

making the ceremonial first 
deconstruction of some of 
the brick outside the State 
Theatre.

“We 
are 
thrilled 
this 

evening to formally announce 
the 
State 
and 
Michigan 

Project: 
our 
campaign 
to 

renovate the State Theatre 
and to make critical capital 
improvements to our beloved 
Michigan 
Theater,” 
said 

Hillary Murt, the Michigan 
Theater Foundation chair.

For many students, such 

as LSA seniors Kat Johnson 
and Eric Grant, the State 
Theatre closing temporarily is 
bittersweet — because though 
they cannot attend any shows 
at their favorite local venue 
during their final school year, 
it’ll be a better experience for 
them in the future.

“I’m happy that they’re 

doing renovations,” Grant said. 
“But also I’m really jealous 
and kind of angry that this is 
my last year here.”

Johnson said she has been 

seeing a film at the State 
every month since she was a 
freshman. She has gotten to 
know people better, such as 
Grant, by attending midnight 
premieres at the State with 
them.

“I think it’s a great way 

to bring students into film, 
overall,” 
Johnson 
said. 
“I 

think the State’s role is pulling 
young people into movies.”

Both agreed that the art 

house experience is unique to 
the State. When it comes to 
choosing what films to show, 
they said the State does a good 
job curating their titles to not 
just include the next big movie.

“It’s just this classic art 

house, midnight movie kind 
of place,” Grant said. “You just 
go there to see a movie and 
experience that kind of art 
house feel.”

Collins said he recognizes 

students love to go to movies to 
take a break from school, and 
hopes the long-term benefits 
of the project outweigh the 
current construction. Overall, 
he 
said 
the 
two 
theaters 

combined 
offer 
a 
unique 

opportunity for students to 
enjoy art films while they are 
on campus.

“The 
purpose 
of 
the 

Michigan and State Theatre is 
to present cinema not only as 
a fun enjoyable thing to do but 
as a vital cultural resource,” 
Collins 
said. 
“Having 
a 

diversity of cinema — the kind 
of cinema you might see in a 
big city — that’s the kind of 
thing that a university town 
likes. A very sophisticated, 
educated, town and university 
like the University of Michigan 
like this kind of thing. So many 
places just don’t have these 
specialty movie theaters.”

her about the tour. In a statement 
Tuesday, 
Weaver 
criticized 

Trump’s 
visit 
as 
purely 
for 

publicity.

“Flint is focused on fixing 

the problems caused by lead 
contamination of our drinking 
water, not photo ops,” she said. 
She added that the water plant 
employees “cannot afford the 
disruption of a last-minute visit.”

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, prior to Trump’s arrival, 
several dozen people gathered 

outside of the plant to protest his 
visit, criticizing Trump for what 
they described as the insincerity of 
his visit. This sentiment remained 
throughout Wednesday.

During Trump’s remarks, Rev. 

Faith Green Timmons interrupted 
Trump when he began to talk 
about Clinton, saying, “Mr. Trump, 
I invited you here to thank us for 
what we’ve done in Flint, not to 
give a political speech,” according 
to the Free Press.

Trump 
responded 
to 
the 

interruption by saying he would 
return to the subject of Flint and 
continued his speech on helping 
solve the city’s problems.

“I can only say in the strongest 

of terms that we can fix this 
problem, it’s going to take time, it’s 
amazing the damage that’s been 
done,” Trump said, according to 
the Detroit News. “But we’ll get it 
fixed and … it will be fixed quickly 
and effectively and Flint will come 
back. Most importantly, we’ll bring 
jobs back to Flint.”

The Michigan Republican Party 

fired back at the idea that the 
candidate’s interest was not about 
Flint’s residents during his visit 
with a statement, charging that 
Clinton used the city as a political 
tool during the primary season 
and no longer cares about the city. 
Clinton visited the city in February; 
her daughter Chelsea made a stop 

there shortly after.

“This blatant hypocrisy gives 

a free pass to Clinton, who hasn’t 
been to Flint since the Michigan 
primary 
ended. 
She 
scored 

political points on the backs of Flint 
residents, and now has moved on,” 
the statement read. “Meanwhile, 
Donald Trump is focused on 
finding ways to prevent tragedies 
like this from happening again.”

During the primary season, 

the Flint water crisis emerged as 
a major issue for the Democratic 
party with attention from Hillary 
Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–
VT) and President Barack Obama, 
culminating in a primary debate 
in Flint. Weaver also received a 

speaking slot at the Democratic 
National Convention in July.

This is Trump’s first visit to the 

city, and the issue only briefly came 
up during a primary debate held 
in Detroit. However, Michigan 
Attorney General Bill Schuette 
spoke at the Republican National 
Convention, where he highlighted 
the issue.

State Sen. Jim Ananich (D–

Flint) defended Clinton in a press 
call prior to Trump’s visit, saying 
she is the candidate who has stood 
by the side of the city.

“After first refusing to even 

comment on Flint when the crisis 
broke — and doing nothing for 
Flint families since then — Trump 

now wants to fly into Flint for 
a photo-op,” he said. “This is in 
stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, 
who has been fighting for Flint 
residents. While Trump has failed 
to show up and offer to help, Hillary 
Clinton came to Flint months ago — 
right away — and offered her help 
to families affected by the water 
crisis.”

Democrats also had a presence 

on Flint issues Wednesday — 
Weaver joined U.S. Rep. Dan 
Kildee (D–Flint), U.S. Sen. Debbie 
Stabenow (D–MI) and U.S. Sen. 
Gary Peters (D–MI) for a press 
conference in D.C., urging federal 
legislators to continue to take 
action in Flint.

TRUMP
From Page 1A

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, told the Daily he 
supports Clinton’s plan, as it 
helps the students who truly have 
need without overextending to 
provide aid to the wealthiest 
families who are capable of 
paying.

“This is a reconciliation of 

Sen. 
Sanders’ 
original 
plan 

and her hesitation to allow 
supremely rich families, such as 
the children of Donald Trump 
for example, to benefit from free 
college when they don’t need it,” 
he said. “Her focus on debt free 
college, then, would increase 
affordability for students with 
financial need while still forcing 
those with greater means to pay 
full tuition.”

On the flip side, Students for 

Sanders President Nick Kolenda 
argued that, despite the upsides 
to Clinton’s plan, tuition free 
remains the better alternative. 
According 
to 
Kolenda, 
the 

corresponding 
tax 
increase 

on the wealthy would act as a 
surrogate for paying tuition for 
those families and that making 
college 
entirely 
tuition-free 

would even the playing field for 
all students.

Kolenda said he particularly 

finds issue with the requirement 
that, 
under 
Clinton’s 
plan, 

students must contribute through 

work earnings that could be put 
to better use.

“Requiring 
low-income 

students to work a job to stay 
tuition-free when other students 
can work a job for extra cash or 
savings will keep low-income 
family students in a game of 
catch-up,” he said. “If we make it 
tuition-free, then even students 
from low-income families can 
save up money.”

The other aspect of both plans 

is debt refinancing for those with 
existing loans. Sanders’ plan 
calls for across the board interest 
rate cuts for all borrowers, while 
Clinton’s 
includes 
income-

based plans, which would allow 
borrowers 
to 
specify 
their 

repayments 
based 
on 
their 

current income.

With Clinton’s plan for the 

state of Michigan, up to 89 
percent of families would have 
the option for tuition-free college. 
The Clinton campaign estimates 
that by 2021, 151,000 students 
would come from families who 
make less than $125,000, making 
them eligible for free tuition.

State Contribution
Regardless 
of 
the 
higher 

education reform plan’s structure, 
if implemented the plan’s success 
would depend on the degree 
to 
which 
state 
governments 

cooperate. State contribution is 
essential to Clinton’s plan, but 
this may prove difficult in states 
that have heavily disinvested in 
higher education.

In Michigan, the national 

trend of disinvestment has been 
clearly reflected by years of 
funding cuts culminating in a 
significantly larger 15-percent 
cut in 2011. Since 2011, funding 
has slowly increased, with the 
most recent state budget bringing 
aggregate funding back to pre-
2011 levels.

Under Clinton’s plan, states 

will be required to maintain their 
current level of contribution 
and to implement a large scale 
reinvestment over time — but 
some lawmakers are skeptical of 
this.

State Rep. Adam Zemke (D–

Ann Arbor) remains critical of 
the current legislature’s ability 
to reinvest in higher education 
on the level needed for Clinton’s 
plan to function well. However, 
he added he believes Clinton’s 
proposal is missing the details 
needed to accurately predict its 
success if implemented.

“There would need to be a fairly 

substantial increase in support 
from the federal government,” 
Zemke said. “And you would have 
to have people who are in charge 
of the state who would be willing 
to prioritize this and we have not 
seen that out of the Republican 
majority.”

State Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker 

(R–Kent County), who chairs the 
Higher Education Committee, 
agreed with Zemke on the 
need for additional details but 
appeared more optimistic on the 
legislature’s ability to reinvest in 
higher education.

“As with many broad, complex 

policy changes, the answer is 
in the details. How a federal 
debt-free college plan would 
impact state funding for higher 
education would depend largely 
on how it is implemented,” she 
wrote in an email to the Daily. “I 
have made reinvesting in higher 
education a priority for several 
years.”

The University
The University of Michigan 

has 
continuously 
increased 

tuition over the past several 
years. 
Since 
2003, 
in-state 

tuition has nearly doubled from 
$3,434 per semester to $6,928. 
The University points to the 
disinvestment from the state in 
higher education to explain this 
jump in student costs. However, 
in the same time frame, tuition 
revenue has increased by 135 
percent, adding $802 of costs 
to tuition when discounting the 
University’s loss of state funding.

Director of Public Affairs 

Rick 
Fitzgerald 
explained 

these increases in an email to 
the Daily in June as reflecting 
the increasing quality of the 
University.

“The cost of running the 

University rises each year in part 
from inflation and in part from 
new initiatives and investments 
in technology and all the things 
that make U-M a world-class 
university,” he wrote.

This 
sentiment 
was 
also 

reflected at the Board of Regents 
meeting in June — when the 

most recent tuition increase was 
approved — during which several 
regents expressed their belief in 
the need to increase funding in 
order to improve the University’s 
educational offerings.

Paul Courant, professor of 

economics and a former provost, 
noted concerns about the quality 
of 
education 
the 
University 

would be able to provide if it 
cannot make the same level of 
revenue from tuition.

“You can make tuition very 

low if you are not buying very 
much with it, but actually we buy 
a lot with tuition. We have a first 
rate faculty, excellent laboratory 
facilities and all manner of 
support for students in a variety 
of areas and tuition is one of the 
sources that covers these things,” 
he said. “If we have to be debt 
free and the state and federal 
government cannot come up with 
enough money that we normally 
generated from tuition then there 
will have to be an adjustment 
made on what the education itself 
is.”

Courant 
maintained 

throughout that it is difficult 
to 
conjecture 
costs 
without 

knowing how much the state 
and federal government will 
contribute.

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack echoed Courant, saying 
she does not wish to comment on 
Clinton’s plan until more details 
are provided.

“I’m just not prepared to speak 

to that one yet,” she said. “There’s 

not yet a clear enough picture of 
what’s being proposed, what the 
government would provide, what 
would be required of the states. 
I don’t want to give you a stupid 
answer.”

Elitism and Diversity
Plans 
like 
Clinton’s 
and 

Sanders’s for increasing college 
affordability have also lead to 
concerns about increased elitism 
and decreased diversity at top 
institutions. The fear is that the 
prospect of free tuition would 
cause more prospective students 
to apply to top tier public 
universities over private ones. 
This in turn could cause lower-
income and minority students 
to 
resort 
to 
lower-quality 

universities 
or 
community 

colleges.

At the University, there has 

been a push for increased diversity 
under University President Mark 
Schlissel’s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan. In the state of 
Michigan, 
affirmative 
action 

was outlawed under Proposal 
2, meaning the University must 
find alternative ways to increase 
minority enrollment.

According to Courant, since 

the 
University 
already 
faces 

this issue, he does not believe 
Clinton’s plan would significantly 
impact current efforts.

“That problem already exists,” 

he said. “There’s nothing in 
particular in this plan as I 
understand it that will make it 
more difficult — I expect it may 
be harder to find the money.” 

REFORM
From Page 1A

by external committees, but it 

has been particularly important 
for the sustainability programs in 
recent years.

“I think the provost analyzed 

that this was a really good time 
to have a look at sustainability 
programs in this space, because 
when you look forward to the 21st 
century, sustainability is a key issue 
for human societies.” Holloway 
said. “So it was just good timing to 
do that review.”

Soon 
after 
the 
external 

review, Holloway said an internal 
committee, 
the 
Committee 

on 
Academic 
Programs 
in 

Environment and Sustainability, 
was tasked with the challenge 
of creating a more integrated 
structure within the sustainability 
programs and it delivered its 
recommendations on how to do so 
in the spring of 2016.

“(The Internal Committee’s) 

report in the spring of 2016 
proposed a structure to create 
greater synergy and integration 
among our sustainability work,” 
Holloway 
said. 
“Within 
that 

report was the proposal for a new 
school that would address global 
sustainability challenges at the 
intersection of environment and 
society and that would do research 
and teaching and civic engagement 
in that space.”

Arun Agrawal, a co-chair of the 

Committee on Academic Programs 
in Environment and Sustainability 
and professor at the current Natural 
Resources 
and 
Environment 

School, said currently University 
faculty work on a wide range of 
issues on how to achieve greater 
sustainability, but there is a need 
for greater coordination between 
the faculty and students, leading to 
the desire for a new school.

“Most 
of 
this 
coordination 

happens in a very decentralized 
way, and there’s not that much 
coordination 
that 
happens,” 

Agrawal said. “So one talk would 
be that if we had a central unit or 
core location which would both 
track what was going on around the 
University and provide information 
to everybody in it and which could 
also provide some support for 
coordination, that would be to the 

benefit of both the University and 
its faculty and its students, most 
importantly.”

Deborah 
Goldberg, 
another 

co-chair 
of 
the 
Committee 

on 
Academic 
Programs 
in 

Environment and Sustainability 
and professor of ecology and 
evolutionary biology, said the new 
school will be interdisciplinary and 
aims to bring faculty of different 
academic backgrounds together 
through the use of disciplinary 
clusters and sustainability themes.

“We 
would 
have 
these 

disciplinary clusters that would 
be a critical mass of people in a 
particular area that you need. 

It might be in environmental 
chemistry, it might be in ecology, 
it might be in urban development, 
it might be in environmental 
engineering,” Goldberg said.

“And then there would also 

be these sustainability themes, 
through 
water, 
transportation, 

whatever — again those could 
evolve — and that you would 
bring people together from those 
different 
disciplinary 
clusters 

to work on finding sustainable 
solutions to those themes.”

She added that this idea would 

solve many of the concerns about a 
lack of unity mentioned at town hall 
meetings held by the committee 
last winter. 

“A lot of what we heard is we 

need to bring people together, to 
find mechanisms that would allow 
people from across campus to work 
together,” Goldberg said. “Again 

and again we heard ‘I work on 
this and I know there are people 
working on a similar question in 
another school but I don’t have a 
good way to meet them.’ ”

In addition to the new school 

being more interdisciplinary, the 
committee also suggested the new 
school, the Graham Sustainability 
Institute and the Program in the 
Environment have more synergy.

Goldberg said the Program 

in the Environment, a current 
undergraduate program in LSA, 
will undergo some changes so that 
it is co-owned by the new school 
and LSA, as well as any other 
schools or colleges that would like 

to participate.

“What we recommended and 

what my understanding of what 
the provost is working on is a jointly 
owned program by LSA and the 
new school. Students would still be 
admitted to LSA, they would major 
in the program and still remain 
LSA students and have a joint 
degree between LSA and the new 
school,” Goldberg said.

She added that if, for example, 

a student in the College of 
Engineering wanted to participate 
in the program, they would have a 
joint degree in Engineering and the 
new school.

Don Scavia, director of the 

Graham Sustainability Institute, 
said the main changes that will 
take place for the Institute is in its 
governance structure.

“What we had up until now 

was a Dean’s Council that had 

about 10 different deans on it, 
that was giving advice to the 
Institute as we were building and 
growing over time,” Scavia said. 
“What we’re doing at this point is 
transitioning that from an advisory 
group into a governance board. 
It will be composed of deans or 
their representatives from LSA, 
from the new school, Engineering, 
Public Health, Public Policy, and 
Taubman and Business. It will be 
co-chaired by the vice provost and 
the dean of the new school.”

Scavia said this new format will 

allow the Institute to work more 
closely with the schools.

“What this will do is give us a 

much stronger connection to the 
schools in general and this board 
will be overseeing the overall 
direction of the program,” he said.

Scavia said the changes to the 

Institute are occurring this fall, 
and after he steps down as director 
in December, a new director for the 
Institute will start in January.

Agrawal said some of the other 

recommendations in the report 
are already being implemented, 
while others may take more time 
to come to fruition. Currently, a 
search committee appointed by 
Pollack is in the process of finding 
a dean, whih is slated to take up 
to a year. After the dean is chosen, 
he or she will have more say in 
faculty searches, and there will 
be more progress on the actual 
curriculum of the programs. Other 
decisions, such as the new name 
and the mission statement, should 
be decided within the next six 
months.

Holloway said he hopes the 

University will be recognized 
as the best in the field of 
sustainability because of its future 
interdisciplinary work.

“Sustainability 
for 
human 

activities 
isn’t 
about 
any 

one 
discipline, 
it’s 
truly 

interdisciplinary. 
It’s 
about 

bringing 
disciplines 
together 

to look at issues from a science 
perspective, a policy perspective, a 
humanistic perspective,” Holloway 
said. “And so I think what we’re 
hoping to see going forward is that 
the University of Michigan will 
be recognized as the key player 
in sustainability because we can 
bring together expertise in so 
many different areas and so many 
disciplines.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


M

y first visit to Ann Arbor 
was on April 4, 2015. 
Having recently been 

accepted to the 
University 
of 

Michigan, 
my 

family decided 
to drive around 
for a bit before checking into 
our hotel room to familiarize 
ourselves with the campus. As we 
drove down State Street, we noted 
how crowded the campus looked. 
As we turned down South U, we 
marveled at how beautiful, yet 
dirty, the Law Quad was. It wasn’t 
until we turned down Tappan 
Avenue that it hit us. “What’s that 
smell?” my grandma asked.

Unbeknownst to us, our blue 

minivan was weaving its way 
through the chaos of the 44th 
annual Hash Bash. 

I knew right away that Ann 

Arbor, 
and 
consequently 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan, 
was 

different. 
Choosing 
to 
attend 

Michigan would mean I’d finally 
be immersed in a progressive 
and inviting environment full of 
intellectually stimulating people 
and ideas. What I didn’t realize 
was 
that 
these 
experiences 

wouldn’t all be as accessible and 
open as Hash Bash — most times, 
these 
eye-opening 
experiences 

would have to be sought.

Following the conclusion of 

freshman convocation, I walked 
over to the University’s welcome 
picnic in front of Angell Hall. 
As my cursory scan of the lawn 
revealed what I’d already known 
— I recognized no familiar faces 
— a terrible thought crossed my 
mind: I should’ve gone to Penn 
State. If I did, I could’ve roomed 
with high school friends and, 
at the very least, I wouldn’t be 
feeling so alone. But seeing as 
I’d chose Michigan, I was stuck 
in Ann Arbor for at least the 
next year. 

At this point, it would’ve been 

easy for me to retire to my room, 

call 
some 
hometown 
friends 

and count down the days until 
Thanksgiving Break. But doing 
so would ensure that I’d miss out 
on the amazing opportunities 
available 
at 
this 
school. 
As 

unpleasant as it was not knowing 
anyone, robbing myself of the 
chance to grow by not spending 
time outside of my comfort zone 
would’ve been equally egregious. 
So, apprehensively, I went out to 
meet people.

The rest of Welcome Week 

was spent exploring campus with 
new acquaintances, bonding over 
the mix of risible University-
sponsored 
events 
(such 
as 
a 

“Party for Your Mind” in the 
Shapiro Library) and not-quite-
sanctioned 
festivities 
around 

campus. Welcome Week turned 
into classes, and gradually, this 
feeling of isolation began to 
fade away. After a few weeks, 
I’d learned the campus layout 
and I was getting into the swing 
of my courses. This was finally 
the college of my high school 
imagination, I naively thought to 
myself. Yet again, I was wrong.

Soon 
after 
classes 
started, 

various 
student 
organizations 

began 
accepting 
applications 

for new membership. While the 
University brags about the number 
of clubs it has on campus, it never 
says anything about how selective 
many of them are. Wanting to 
branch out and try new things, I 
applied to many clubs. However, 
it seemed every day I was opening 
my email to find ones that started 
with “Thank you for your interest 
in … ” and not “Congratulations.”

This 
constant 
stream 
of 

rejections caused me to doubt 
whether or not I had what it 
took to thrive at this University. 
Additionally, 
I 
began 
feeling 

like I’d never find a close group 
of friends, only a loose group of 
acquaintances 
who 
happened 

to live near me. With everyone 
hyping up college to be the 

best time of your life — coupled 
with looking at Snapchats and 
Instagram posts of high school 
friends who all seemed to be 
having an easier transition than I 
was — I thought I was the only one 
feeling these emotions.

What I didn’t realize was that 

these were all normal feelings 
to have. However, I only came to 
this realization after continuing 
to push myself to socialize and 
explore my interests, even in the 
face of failure. One instance in 
particular stands out. I was in West 
Quadrangle’s game room chatting 
with some new acquaintances 
when one by one, people left to 
retire for the night. By the end of 
the evening, it was just me and 
one of my now-closest friends (but 
at the time, just a girl from my 
dorm). Though we’d just met, she 
went on about how she missed her 
friends and family back home in 
North Carolina. For the first time 
since arriving on campus, I heard 
someone else acknowledge how 
hard the transition was. Every 
other freshman, it seemed, was so 
eager to forget the past 18 years of 
their life. It was refreshing to hear 
at least one other person who felt 
the same as I did.

Looking back, I wish I could tell 

my freshman year self to just keep 
on trying, and that, eventually, 
time would sort things out. I’d also 
tell myself that if I keep on joining 
clubs that seem interesting, I’d 
eventually finally find some that 
I love; and if I keep on trying to 
meet new people and strengthen 
the relationships I currently have, 
I’d finally get a solid group of 
friends. Most importantly, I’d tell 
myself to focus on enjoying my 
time at the University and in Ann 
Arbor. But since I can’t go back to 
tell myself these lessons, the best I 
can do is tell them to you.

FROM THE DAILY

It gets better

O

n Aug. 4, Ann Arbor became the first city in Michigan 
to raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco from 18 
to 21. This change was an effort by the Ann Arbor City 

Council to lower the rate of tobacco-related illnesses, combat 
rising smoking rates among adults and prevent access to tobacco 
among 15- to 17-year-olds. The ordinance states individuals 
under 21 won’t be punished for smoking tobacco products, but 
those who sell or give tobacco products or electronic smoking 
devices to underage individuals will face penalties. While the 
dangers of smoking are important to combat, this ordinance, 
because it contravenes a state law and didn’t fully consider 
public opinion, is flawed.

Raising 
the 
minimum 
age 
for 

purchasing tobacco products is beneficial 
from a public health perspective, but 
City Council should not have passed an 
ordinance that obviously contradicts the 
Tobacco Product Tax Act of 1993, a state 
law pertaining to the sale of tobacco 
products, which states 18-year-olds can 
legally purchase tobacco. What’s more, 
the council passed the ordinance without 
ever putting it on the ballot, and though 
voter turnout rates for city elections are 
traditionally low, failing to put this issue 
to the ballot likely resulted in reduced 
input from Ann Arbor residents. 

The city’s attempt to curb underage 

smoking 
does 
demonstrate 
a 
well-

intentioned effort to improve public 
health, 
with 
some 
council 
members 

claiming the public health benefits of 
passing the ordinance outweigh the costs 
of infringing on individual liberties. Public 
health officials, who strongly supported 
the ordinance, charged that tobacco is 
the leading cause of preventable death in 
the United States, making increasing the 
minimum age to 21 necessary on moral 
and 
financial 
grounds. 
Furthermore, 

tobacco is a social drug — young teens 
obtain access to these substances from 
older teens who they associate with. A 
lower minimum age on the purchase of 
tobacco creates a buffer between 15- to 
17-year-olds and older teens who can 
legally purchase tobacco products. 

However, 
intentions 
aside, 
under 

the Tobacco Product Tax Act, local 
governments “shall not impose any new 

requirement or prohibition pertaining to 
the sale or licensure of tobacco products 
for distribution purposes.” The city 
clearly acted outside its jurisdiction by 
passing this ordinance, demonstrating an 
overstep of municipal power. 

In addition, the council’s deliberate 

refusal to listen the voice of Ann Arbor’s 
community warrants criticism. Despite 
holding an open hearing on the issue — 
during which many Ann Arbor residents 
voiced their concerns with the issue — 
the city refused to include the ordinance 
on a public ballot. The hearing was also 
held in the summer, which may have 
been why most college students — the age 
group most affected by the law — were 
not present to speak on the bill. Though 
voter turnout in local elections tends 
to be very low, it serves as no excuse to 
bypass the democratic process. In passing 
this ordinance during the summer and 
without putting it on the ballot, the 
city government reneged on its duty as 
representatives of the public will.

Though it’s beneficial from a public 

health standpoint to raise the age one can 
purchase tobacco, City Council should not 
have passed an ordinance that contradicts 
state law, and especially should not have 
done so without putting the issue to a vote. 
That being said, passing the ordinance 
has started an important conversation 
about the issue. If the ordinance produces 
the desired outcomes, it will signal to the 
state government that change is needed.

Over the summer, the Michigan 

House 
of 
Representatives 

approved a bill that would allow 
Michigan high school students to 
take computer science courses in 
lieu of foreign language courses. 
Michigan is not the first state 
to 
consider 
such 
legislation: 

Students in Florida and Texas can 
already elect to take a computer 
science course instead of a foreign 
language, and a handful of other 
states have considered adopting 
similar legislation.

Computer 
science 
education 

is one of the most burning topics 
in academia today as the global 
economy 
becomes 
more 
and 

more dependent on computer-
literate workers. Some of the 
nation’s largest school districts 
already have plans in place to 
implement 
computer 
science 

programs into their curricula in 
an effort to equip their students 
with highly valuable computer 
skills. However, computer science 
curricula should not supplant 
traditional 
foreign 
language 

curricula; in fact, this interchange 
would ultimately come to the 
detriment 
to 
the 
students’ 

learning experience, as computer 
science 
and 
foreign 
language 

teach 
students 
two 
different, 

albeit important, skill sets.

The difference stems from the 

fact that computer languages are 
not natural languages. Unlike 
natural languages, no one innately 
picks up a computer language, nor 
does anyone speak it or use it to 
communicate with others. This 
is because languages like Java 
and CSS were not designed for 
this purpose; they were designed 
so humans can teach computers 
to think, instruct computers on 
what to do. Therefore, if someone 
learns to code, they learn a 
technical skill.

Due to its nature as a technical 

skill, rather than a communicative 
skill, it’s much easier to achieve 
fluency in a computer language 
than it is to achieve fluency 
in a natural language. Unlike 
computer languages, which are 

designed to be simple and precise, 
natural 
languages 
are 
chock 

full of ambiguity and nuance. 
Learners of a natural language 
must become familiar with things 
like 
synonyms, 
idioms, 
verb 

conjugations, tone and context 
clues — all of which are difficult to 
learn in a first language, let alone 
a second. Becoming competent 
in a foreign language therefore 
requires an immense amount of 
time, effort and critical thinking 
skills; 
fluency 
in 
a 
natural 

language can take years.

Part of the reason fluency in 

natural languages is so hard to 
achieve is that language requires 
immersion — constantly engaging 
in conversation. Such a task is 
incredibly difficult for students 
to do on their own. (On the other 
hand, it’s not uncommon to hear 
about people teaching themselves 
to code.) Of course, there are 
resources 
available 
to 
learn 

foreign languages on your own, 
such as Duolingo or Rosetta Stone. 
However, these courses are either 
costly (Rosetta Stone costs $199 
for a 2-year subscription) or do not 
facilitate the type of interaction 
necessary to truly get a firm 
grasp on the language. Classroom 
environments, especially those 
where the foreign language is 
the only language spoken during 
class, might be the only place a 
student can experience the type 
of interaction needed to acquire a 
second language.

Whereas learning a computer 

language requires a student to 
learn 
the 
language’s 
syntax, 

foreign 
language 
courses 

encompass much more than some 
vocabulary words and a set of 
grammatical 
rules. 
Any 
good 

language course will weave in 
aspects of life in the countries 
where the language is spoken, 
giving 
students 
insight 
into 

cultures other than their own. 
Some of my best memories of the 
Hebrew courses I have taken were 
days where we cooked Israeli 
foods, watched Israeli films or 
discussed controversial topics that 

were pertinent to the country’s 
social and political climate. Such 
subject matter allows students to 
gain awareness of what matters to 
people in other parts of the world, 
breeding empathy and a better 
understanding of how to approach 
conversation with others.

Society 
often 
brushes 

aside interpersonal skills like 
communication 
and 
empathy, 

marking them as innate and 
therefore easy to acquire. But 
anyone who has taken a foreign 
language 
course 
knows 
how 

hard it is to become proficient 
in a second language, and these 
interpersonal 
skills 
make 
a 

working knowledge of a language 
other than your own just as, or 
even more, advantageous in the 
global economy. After all, every 
job requires human interaction, 
and as society becomes more 
globalized, understanding not 
only the language but also the 
sensitivities of other cultures 
becomes much more important 
in industry.

To condemn the role that 

computer science plays in our 
world today would be ignorant, 
as it has applications in nearly 
every field, if not all fields. Should 
students be encouraged to take 
a programming course at some 
point in their academic career? 
Of course. Should high schools, or 
even the University of Michigan, 
require a programming course as a 
graduation prerequisite? Perhaps.

But to offer or even encourage 

computer science courses as an 
alternative to foreign language 
courses would ultimately do a 
disservice to students. Technical 
skills can only get a student so far 
in their academic and professional 
careers. It is the interpersonal 
and critical thinking skills that 
are honed through courses like 
foreign language courses that will 
truly allow students to succeed in 
their professional life.

Borges returns to left 
back against Hoosiers

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Marcello Borges may be listed 

on the Michigan men’s soccer 
team’s roster as a defender, but 
that’s only because the position 
“utility” isn’t an option.

Borges has become a fixture in 

the Wolverines’ starting 11, but 
recently, the sophomore’s position 
in each match has been a guessing 
game.

Michigan coach Chaka Daley 

has started Borges in a different 
spot in each of the previous four 
games he has started, and that 
trend continued for a fifth game 
Wednesday night, when he finally 
returned to his typical position at 
left back in the Wolverines’ 2-0 
loss to No. 3 Indiana.

“It’s always hard to keep 

switching positions and going 
back to playing your most natural 
position,” Borges said. “Even after 
a little bit of experience I still 
think I needed time to settle in, 
and I think that’s what happened 
for me today.”

Due 
to 
injuries 
and 

inexperience on the rest of the 
roster, Borges began the season 
playing multiple attacking roles 
— including as a striker, central 
attacking midfielder and both 
wings. But despite his remarkable 
dribbling and crossing ability, 
Borges still looked somewhat 
uncomfortable, especially when 
trying to find the final touch in 
front of goal. The sophomore 
entered Wednesday night’s game 
leading the team with 14 shots, but 
had failed to convert any into the 
goals Michigan has desperately 
needed.

Facing a tough test against the 

Hoosiers’ dynamic attack, Daley 
made the decision to push Borges 
back to defense. For a majority of 
the match, Indiana attacked the 
flank opposite to Borges, who 
was successfully challenging any 
winger or midfielder that dribbled 
his way.

“He’s a very dynamic player,” 

said 
senior 
defender 
Lars 

Eckenrode. “Both going forward 
and defending. He’s very strong, 
both-footed and, going forward, 
he helps us out a lot. Also, in the 
defensive end, he knows where to 
be tactically. He really knows the 
ins and outs of the position, and 
helps us out on both sides of the 
ball a lot.”

It’s no surprise the Hoosiers 

were 
finding 
more 
success 

attacking the right side of the 
Wolverines’ defense away from 
Borges on Wednesday night. The 
sophomore defender is widely 
regarded as one of the best left 
backs in all of 
college 
soccer. 

Borges 
has 

been 
a 
key 

contributor 
on the United 
States 
U-20 

National 
Team, 
already 

making 
eight 

appearances for 
the squad this 
calendar year.

“Playing 
with 
the 
best 

players in the country, you learn 
something from them and they 
learn something from me,” Borges 
said. “Everything I learned there 
I can bring back to Michigan and 
teach the other guys.”

With 
Michigan’s 
attack 

returning to full health, Borges 

will likely have to resettle into his 
roll as a full back. But there were 
moments against the Hoosiers 
where the instinct he developed 
playing up front may have led to 
poor decisions at the back.

Particularly 
on 
Indiana’s 

second goal, Borges was caught 
too far forward when a perfectly 
placed cross flew past him, 
exposing the Wolverines’ back 
line to the counterattack.

Despite 
Borges’ 
error, 
he 

proved if there’s one area in 
Michigan’s 
attack 
that 
can 

consistently rely on the full back 
getting forward, it’s on set pieces. 
The Wolverines’ closest scoring 
chance came in the 35th minute, 
when Borges’ free kick connected 
with Eckenrode, whose header 
rung the crossbar.

There may be opportunities in 

the future for Michigan to take 
advantage of Borges’ attacking 
ability, but he proved against 

the 
Hoosiers 

he 
can 
be 

best 
utilized 

at 
defense. 

Now that he 
understands 
what 
the 

Wolverines 
need to spark 
their 
attack, 

Borges could 
be essential in 
starting those 

chances from where he’s meant to 
be, back on the left side.

“Playing in the back, you don’t 

understand what the guys in the 
front are going through,” Borges 
said. “Looking at them and seeing 
what they need help in from the 
back helped me gain a better 
understanding.”

Wolverines fall to Indiana

By HUNTER SHARF

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team is focusing on the small 
victories. Though the third-
ranked 
Hoosiers 
(1-0-1 
Big 

Ten, 
4-0-2 

overall) bested the Wolverines 
(0-0-2 Big Ten, 0-3-3 overall), 
Michigan’s strong team play 
against a highly ranked team 
provides hope for the near future.

Senior defender and team 

captain Lars Eckenrode called 
the game a “moral victory,” 
commending 
his 
teammates 

superior teamwork and relentless 
play.

“I thought we did a great job 

playing a national powerhouse,” 
Eckenrode said. “We got unlucky 
in spots, but we played hard as 
a team and the coaches and the 
team are happy with how we 
preformed.”

Michigan’s 
aggressive 

approach was evident from the 
first whistle, but both teams 
struggled to get any momentum 
going early. After some back-
and-forth play, Indiana’s defense 

became a key factor, successfully 
keeping the Michigan offense out 
of Hoosier territory. Indiana’s 
strong defense eventually carried 
over to the offense, leading to 
a goal off of a blocked shot by 
Michigan goalie Evan Louro 
with 26:22 to go in the first half. 

Instead of bowing down to 

the high-ranked Hoosiers, the 
Wolverines seemed to gain a 
sense of urgency after the goal.

“The team began to control the 

time of possession, and pass the 
ball well,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “We played really 
well, we passed really well, we 
had Indiana on their back foot.”

With 10 minutes remaining 

in the half, Michigan missed on 
its biggest opportunity of the 
game, when Eckenrode hit the 
crossbar from a corner kick by 
senior defender Rylee Woods. The 
Wolverines’ inability to convert 
on scoring opportunities was the 
story for much of the first half, but 
Eckenrode and junior defenseman 
Billy Stevens kept Michigan in 
the game with a strong defensive 
showing, which held the score to 
1-0 going into half.

With just five goals in six 

games, an inability to score has 

been the biggest issue for the 
Wolverines this season. While 
their strong defense has helped 
hide it, the offense is still keeping 
them out of the win column.

The 
offensive 
struggles 

are 
especially 
frustrating 

considering 
Michigan 
ranks 

ninth in the nation and first in 
the Big Ten in shots per game, 
averaging 17 per game (prior to 
tonight’s game).

“The team has just been 

unfortunate, not finding the back 
of the net this season and again 
tonight,” Daley said.

In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 

Wolverines experienced the same 
misfortune, as they were unable 
to find the back of the net. In the 
end, Indiana showed its veteran 
experience, scoring a late goal and 
cementing the win at 2-0.

Despite 
the 
disheartening 

losses, the Wolverines are looking 
to carry their strong defensive 
play into a tough matchup with 
Michigan State this Sunday.

“We are happy that we can 

compete with a high ranked, 
solid team like Indiana,” Daley 
said. “We know we can play 
with them. We look to use this 
momentum.”
Freshman setter Welsh 
stepping up early for ‘M’

No. 23 Michigan 

relying on big 

contributions from 

young setter

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

MacKenzi 
Welsh 
started 

opening night at Cliff Keen Arena 
as the only freshman on the floor 
for the Michigan volleyball team. 
Going from an average high 
school team to playing for the 
23rd-ranked college team in the 
country was a wake-up call for 
the young setter.

“It was terrifying,” Welsh 

said. “Other girls were coming 
in and playing, but I was the 
only freshman on the floor for 
the first three rotations.”

But Welsh had trained for this 

moment for years, leading her 
club team — Sports Performance 
Volleyball — to two AAU National 
Championships in 2013 and 2015.

And 
it 
helped 
that 
the 

Wolverines’ 
veteran 
players 

surrounded her in the lineup 
when she made her debut on 
Aug. 26. Welsh called the team’s 
atmosphere 
family-like 
and 
credits 

it for easing 
the transition 
for 
her 
and 

her 
fellow 

freshmen.

“Ever since I 

was little, I’ve 
been 
looking 

up to (college volleyball players) 
and wanting to be a part of this 
kind of culture,” Welsh said 
Wednesday. “It’s been a long-
term dream for me.”

Growing up as an avid college 

volleyball fan in Bolingbrook, 
Ill., she and her family have 
traveled to the NCAA Final 
Four for the past 10 years. In 
2012 — the most recent year 

the Wolverines reached the 
tournament’s final weekend — 
Welsh sat in the front row of the 
stands in the KFC Yum! Center 
cheering 
for 

Michigan. 
It 
was 
extra 

special 
for 

Welsh 
as 

she 
saw 
her 

friend 
and 

former 
club-

teammate 
— 

then-freshman 
outside-hitter 
Ally Davis — in 
action.

Now, as the season progresses, 

Welsh is beginning to see her 
own dream come true. Welsh 
has started to develop specific 
strategies for passing to her outside 
hitters and middle blockers. She 
has succeeded with the help of her 
fellow passers and communication 
with players in the middle.

“It makes it harder for the 

hitters if the pass is off the 
net because then I’m running 
around 
trying 
to 
throw 

something out there,” Welsh 
said. “Our passers are always 
working hard to make the best 
passes possible, to get hitters the 
best set they need.”

Through 

nine 
games, 
her 

preparation 
has 
yielded 

strong results. 
Welsh 
has 

notched 
293 

assists 
and 

averaged 9.45 
per game — 

both team highs. Last weekend, 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
competed 

in the Panther Invitational in 
Pittsburgh, Penn., Welsh tabbed 
116 assists en route to earning a 
spot on the All-Tournament team.

The 
tournament-team 

selection 
shows 
that 
Welsh 

continues to improve week after 
week — coming a long way since 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 

mentioned that the speed of the 
college game overwhelmed the 
freshman at the beginning of the 
season.

“(Welsh’s) 

game is getting 
more mature,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“She’s 

getting 
more 

experience. 
She’s 
getting 

better 
understanding 
of 
what 
we 

want her to do 
and what we 

need her to do in our system.”

With 
a 
tournament-team 

selection under her belt and 
sitting 12th in the Big Ten in 
assists per game, Welsh has had 
quite the start to her freshman 
year. But according to Rosen, 
the 6-foot-1 setter has even 
more untapped potential.

“(She has) a long way to go,” 

Rosen said. “The ceiling’s not 
even close to her right now.”

And given that she is the only 

freshman to have started all 
nine matches, that is quite the 
compliment.

‘M’ relying on ‘four-headed monster’

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Last spring, Michigan running 

backs coach Tyrone Wheatley 
compared a ball carrier taking 
hits to a car depreciating. When 
you drive the car out of the lot, 
it loses value, and when a back 
goes down for the first time, his 
body starts to wear.

Wheatley — a bruising back at 

Michigan in the 1990s in his own 
right — has a strong, physical 
runner in senior De’Veon Smith. 
And while Smith has suffered 
his share of bumps and bruises, 
he still proves that he runs just 
fine, barreling through tackles 
for big gains.

An injury in the first game 

has limited Smith to 16 carries 
so far this season, though, and 
the Wolverines have plenty of 
other backs to help out. Smith 
played for almost all of last 
season as the feature back, but 
Wheatley and the coaching 
staff are still managing to work 
several players into the mix at 
that position.

“Happy 
with 
the 
four,” 

Wheatley said. “Four-headed 
monster. Four horsemen. What 
other things are there? I don’t 
know. But I’m happy with the 
four.”

The group consists of Smith, 

freshman 
Chris 
Evans, 

redshirt junior 
Ty Isaac and 
sophomore 
Karan 
Higdon. If he’s 
healthy, Smith 
takes the lion’s 
share of the 
workload. He 
also has the 
most physical running style, 
but Wheatley doesn’t mind the 
variety that the other backs 
bring.

“De’Veon is a special guy,” 

Wheatley said. “Every back 
is special in his own unique 

way. Those two runs, the two 
runs that De’Veon had, were 
incredible. 
You 
can’t 
take 

anything away from it. This guy 
breaks two or three tackles, stiff-

arms a guy, 
spin out of it 
and he goes.

“But 
it 

would be very 
unfair for me 
to go back and 
say, 
‘Chris, 

see this? This 
is what you 
should 
do.’ 

That’s 
not 

Chris. Chris can do some things 
that I look at Chris and say, 
‘Well, damn, De’Veon...’ — no. 
It’s unfair.”

Evans, 
meanwhile, 
is 

Michigan’s 
leading 
rusher. 

He’s averaging 8.6 yards on 

17 carries for a team-leading 
147, more than double Smith’s 
65. Excitement about the true 
freshman was mostly internal 
during fall camp, but Evans 
justified it in the season opener 
against Hawaii, rushing for two 
touchdowns in his debut.

At 5-foot-11 and 200 pounds — 

lighter than Smith by 28 — Evans 
also provides a change of pace. 
He has a quick burst that allows 
him to get to the second level 
and gain yards in the open field. 
On his second touchdown run 
against Hawaii — a 43-yarder 
that extended Michigan’s lead to 
42-0 with 13:44 left in the third 
quarter — Evans broke through 
the line and scampered to the 
end zone almost untouched.

“He’s like my Steph Curry in 

the room, meaning that he can 
create his own space,” Wheatley 

said. “He can win one-on-ones, 
and, most surprisingly, and I 
said this earlier, I didn’t realize 
how tough he was between 
the tackles. That was one of 
my things coming in, to see 
how could he run between 
the tackles, his toughness, his 
strength. 
He’s 
surprisingly 

strong.

“But you go in there and next 

week you have Chris run in (the 
game) trying to run everybody 
over, and you’re like, ‘What the 
hell is going on?’ ”

Just as Smith’s power is a 

handful for opponents, so is 
Evans’ speed. The freshman’s 
first chance came with about 
3:30 to go in the first quarter of 
the opener, when Smith came 
off the field holding his ribs and 
only touched the ball once the 
rest of the afternoon. Playing 

four 
backs 
gives 
Wheatley 

the luxury of always having 
another one to come in and 
spell the others. To that end, 
Isaac and Higdon have each 
taken 12 carries in two games, 
rushing for 58 and 56 yards, 
respectively.

With all four players, there 

are constants that Wheatley 
tries to teach: effort, intensity, 
feet movement, perseverance. 
But he reiterated that he likes 
that each one has his own skill 
set. He doesn’t want any of 
them to try to conform to one 
prototype.

“This is the way I tell them: I 

love each and every one of you 
the way you are and where you 
are,” Wheatley said. “That’s 
how I coach you. I coach each 
guy individually, can’t coach 
them all like one.”

‘Frustrated’ Lewis still getting healthy

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 

has allowed just 207 passing 
yards in the first two games of its 
season, but one lingering void in 
the secondary is growing more 
ominous by the day.

Senior 
All-American 

cornerback Jourdan Lewis, who 
established himself as one of the 
best cover men in the country 
with a breakout 2015 season, has 
not played a snap this season due 
to multiple injuries. According to 
secondary coach Mike Zordich, 
Lewis’ intense workout regimen 
over the summer led to a number 
of muscles flaring up during 
fall camp, including his back, 
hamstring and quadriceps.

“He worked his tail off all 

summer — probably worked a 
little too hard,” Zordich said. 
“I think that might have been 
a little too much torque on his 

body, and some of the issues that 
he has had the last couple weeks 
may have been from that. He had 
a hell of a camp, and then all of 
a sudden, things just started (to 
tighten up).”

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

said Lewis was almost healthy 
enough to play in the first week 
against Hawaii, but ultimately 
was held out as a precaution. The 
next week, though, Harbaugh 
said an MRI had shown one of 
the aforementioned muscles had 
suffered a “near pull,” leaving 
Lewis out against Central Florida 
as well.

On 
Monday 
and 
Tuesday 

this week, Lewis worked with 
the training staff, with the plan 
being to see how he feels come 
Saturday. As his status remains 
up in the air, Lewis has had to 
find other ways to contribute to 
the team without overexerting 
himself.

“He’s in the meetings, he’s 

attentive in meetings, he was 
great on the sideline the last two 
games helping out,” Zordich said. 
“Just another pair of eyes to see 
what they’re doing. He’s been a 
good help, a big help.”

The loss of Lewis has been 

mitigated partly by the stellar 
play of the rest of the secondary 
— senior cornerback Channing 
Stribling and fifth-year senior 
cornerback Jeremy Clark have 
shut down the downfield passing 
attack, and Stribling picked up 
his first career pick-six against 
Hawaii. Even redshirt sophomore 
cornerback 
Brandon 
Watson, 

who had just eight tackles while 
making brief appearances in 12 
games last season, has had some 
early success as a third corner.

It may end up being beneficial 

for the Wolverines to get those 
players some extra game action 
early in the season, but tougher 
tests are coming. This Saturday’s 
opponent, Colorado, boasts the 

17th-most avergage passing yards 
in the country (albeit against 
inferior 
opponents 
Colorado 
State 
and 

Idaho 
State), 

and 
next 

week, 
Penn 

State 
comes 

to 
Michigan 

Stadium with 
wide receiver 
Chris Godwin, who broke the 
1,000-receiving-yard mark last 
season.

With the level of competition 

quickly ratcheting up, Lewis is as 
anxious to get back on the field as 
the Wolverines’ fanbase is to see 
him there.

“As a competitor, I think he’s 

frustrated. I don’t know if (he’s) 
discouraged,” Zordich said. “He 
wants to play, but he knows he’s 
got to get his body right before 
he can do that so he doesn’t 

spend more time on the sideline. 
He’s taking the right approach, 

but 
(he’s) 

frustrated, yes, 
certainly.”

There 

remains 
no 

announced 
timetable 
for 

Lewis’ return 
— 
the 
next 

step will be to 
see how his 

body handles a week of practice. 
Zordich said he expects Lewis 
will have some rust to shake 
off, but called him a “pretty 
competitive kid.”

In 
the 
meantime, 
the 

responsibility will fall to Clark, 
Stribling, Watson and others to 
continue holding down the fort.

“It is good in a sense to get 

these other guys experience,” 
Zordich said. “But at the same 
time, you do miss a kid like 
Jourdan Lewis.”

“He worked 
his tail off all 

summer.”

Kerrytown BookFest brings 

together local literary community

2B — Thursday, September 15, 2016

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A book travels a long way 

to get to its reader. It starts as 
a prod in the author’s mind, 
a call to action. That nudge 
then turns into a spilling of 
words out onto a page, which 
is then sent to a publisher to be 
critiqued and reshaped. There, 
the words of the eager author 
are molded into their final 
form, as author and editor alike 
shape this literary outpouring 
into its most impactful self. 
Finally, the book is ready to be 
distributed to curious readers. 
Clasping the freshly bound 
work in their hands, feeling 
the feathery weight of a newly 
purchased book, bibliophiles 
delve into the carefully crafted 
story.

Sunday, the 14th Annual 

Kerrytown BookFest brought 
together all aspects of the 
novel experience — author, 
reader, publisher and more. 
The festival took over the 
Ann Arbor Farmers Market, 
sporting booths and tents with 
a wide range of attractions 
under this year’s theme, 
“Travels with Books.” The 
avenues of the market were 
filled with meandering 
townsfolk and students, 
soaking in the culture and 
crafts of literature. The sky was 
cloudless, and the air was crisp. 
It was a perfect day to find a 
new favorite book.

Local authors, booksellers 

and publishers ran the bulk 
of the booths. Locally owned 
bookstores, such as bigwig 
Literati, made their presence 
known by setting up their own 
booths full of unique books for 
purchase at their respective 
stores. The owners of these 
establishments were often 
manning their displays, giving 
festivalgoers a personal look 
into the management of some 
of their favorite haunts. The 
BookFest also highlighted 
other, lesser-known local 
establishments. In a time when 
privately owned bookstores 
often succumb to the pressure 
of larger chain stores, the 
presence of locally owned, 
thriving businesses was 
refreshing to see.

Aside from those selling 

the finished product, the 
BookFest included individuals 
who help transmit books from 
the imagination to the shelf. 
Michigan-based, first-time 
authors proudly displayed 
their debut works, engaging 
passersby in debates about 
literature, form and authorship. 
Also present were publishers, 
ranging from the large Wayne 
State University Press, based in 
Detroit, to individually owned 
establishments like Splattered 
Ink Press, based in Grand 
Haven.

BookFest also showcased 

readers, sharing the art of 
anyone inspired by written 
word. Cropping up among 
the novels was a vast range of 
paper- and literature-based 
art of all shapes and sizes. 
Artists brought to light the 
potential that paper has on its 
own, rather than just being a 
vehicle for words. There were 
dainty, hand-painted prints 
on cream-colored cardstock 
alongside purses made from 
the shelled-out hulls of beloved 
novels. Attendees could 
purchase jewelry incorporating 
favorite quotes — long pendants 
containing character’s quips 
and hand-etched bracelets with 
simple quotations — or journals 
to archive their own lives and 
stories. The beauty of words, 
especially when displayed 
artistically, was evident in the 
countless prints, canvasses and 
paper collages brought by the 
artists.

While the sheer volume of 

new work presented at the 
Fest was enough to inspire 
confidence in the future of 
print literature, the Kerrytown 
organizers made sure to 
include the storied past of 
print. Vendors toting vintage 

magazine covers, comic books 
and more of the same were 
sprinkled throughout the 
displays rooted in the now. 
Drawing visitors in with the 
unmistakable scent of aged 
paper, these vintage booths 
reminded those gathered of 
just how far the production 
of literature has come. From 
1900s children’s fiction, to early 
music magazines, to books 
on the history of dentistry in 
the United States, any literary 
craving could be satisfied. 
An interesting dynamic was 
created in the nooks of these 
booths. Some visitors were 
drawn in by memories from 
their youth, but others were 
experiencing this aged art for 
the first time.

Celebrating the power of 

words and art, the BookFest 
also provided attendees with 
resources to improve their 
own literary lives. Resources 
made available spanned age, 
gender and level of experience 
to include anybody who may 
want to delve deeper into the 
written world. Local libraries, 
such as the Ann Arbor District 
Library, took part in the Fest, 
as well as literacy groups and 
book clubs. The literacy groups 
were directed at a wide range of 
clientele, including the school-
aged youth of 826michigan 
and the women of Women 
Writers of Ann Arbor/Ypsi. 
The presence of these groups 
made the BookFest inclusive, 
welcoming to neophytes and 
veterans alike.

Like the festival resources, 

the literature itself didn’t cater 
only to seasoned bibliophiles. 
There were several booths 
toting clever children’s 
literature, and an entire tent 
dedicated to children’s book 
readings. The Children’s Tent 
featured animated readings 
by authors, illustrators and 
storytellers. Kicking off the 
day was Mother Goose, who 
shared nursery rhymes with 
the flocks of children gathered 
at her feet. Looking the part, 
Mother Goose sported wire-
rimmed glasses, a floral dress 
and a plush pet goose. The 
later storytellers followed suit, 
donning costumes or using 
enthused voices to bring the 
stories to life. All smiles and 
bursts of laughter or surprise, 
the Children’s Tent was a place 
of candid wonder throughout 
the day.

To inspire a more adult 

sense of awe, the BookFest 
also offered various panels and 
speakers throughout the day. 
Taking place at the Main Tent 
and in the Kerrytown Concert 
Hall, these presentations 
ranged in topic from the sense 
of place in novels, to how to 
make a living as a writer, to 
the hidden gems of Michigan. 
One particularly telling panel, 
including authors Desiree 
Cooper, Kelly Fordon and 
Andrew Mozina, discussed 
the essential place of identity 
within narratives. The 
discourse was rich, tackling 
questions of sexuality, familial 
relations, personal morality and 
more. Each author explained 
the integral role of identity in 
their respective works, despite 
their differences in content. 
As the question of identity is 
one that everyone faces, the 
complexities discussed during 
“The Quest for Identity” 
reverberated outside the 
literary realm and into the 
everyday lives of listeners.

Stepping even deeper into 

the lives of attendees was R.J. 
Fox, the Writer in Residence 
of this year’s BookFest. Fox, 
who graduated with an English 
degree from the University 
of Michigan — Dearborn, is 
a screenwriter, novelist and 
teacher. He was granted the 
task of reading and critiquing 
the first 20 pages of six 
manuscripts submitted prior to 
the festival to a live audience 
during the event. His love of 
writing and narrative, though, 
began well before this past 
Sunday.

“Writing has been my 

passion since high school,” 
Fox said. “I’ve been working 
towards it, writing script after 
script, story after story, getting 
rejected over and over. I just 
kept working at it and not 
giving up.”

This drive to succeed allowed 

Fox to successfully publish his 
novel, “Love and Vodka,” which 
he hopes will be made into 
a movie. While budding as a 
novelist, Fox is also an English 
teacher at Huron High School 
in Ann Arbor. Working closely 
with students and helping them 
develop their own narratives 
made Fox the perfect pick for 
Writer in Residence.

“I love teaching reading 

and writing,” Fox said. “I love 
telling students that when I 
teach, it’s not just because it’s 
my job. I have this passion 
for writing and helping other 
people with their writing. The 
Writer in Residence was right 
up my alley because it combines 
my teaching and my writing 
background.”

As the submitted 

manuscripts were chosen on a 
first-come-first-serve basis, Fox 
encountered a range of style. 
Works spanned from fiction to 
memoir and were penned by 
newcomers as well as published 
authors. The diversity in 
submissions reflected the 
variety of experience found 
within Ann Arbor.

“It’s a wide range of memoir, 

fiction and even poetry,” Fox 
said, referring to the chosen 
manuscripts. “Each one has 
its own challenges. Using any 
information I had myself about 
each genre, I applied it to each 
writer’s piece. Each piece had 
to be treated differently.”

Meeting at the crossroads 

of education and creation, 
Fox pulled from his own 
inspirations as well as academic 
influence to help guide the 
writers. Through his own 
work, as well as the work of 
his students, Fox has learned 
the value of vigilant revising 
and editing. There is always 
room for improvement and 
expansion.

“Writing is hard, even if 

you’re a writer,” said Fox. 
“Any piece of writing, whether 
it’s someone who has been 
published a hundred times or 
someone who has never been 
published, you can always find 
things to make better.”

Fox applies this kind of 

optimism and drive not only to 
his own writing but also to his 
outlook on his work as a whole. 
At last year’s BookFest, Fox 
was one of the flocking authors 
aspiring to one day run a booth 
at the festival. He pinned up 
flyers for his then-new novel in 
any available space, hoping to 
get his name into people’s heads 
and his book into their hands. 
One year later, Fox is becoming 
a respected author and voice in 
the Ann Arbor literature scene.

“Good storytelling is good 

storytelling, whether it’s on 
film or in a book,” Fox said. 
“It’s not about number of copies 
sold, but about meeting people 
and having a chance to do even 
more events like this.”

Events like the Kerrytown 

BookFest, so full of passion for 
creation and art, are always 
zestful and seldom leave 
their attendees unchanged. 
Aside from the splendor of 
displays and presentations, 
it was impossible to miss 
the conversations going on 
around these attractions. Each 
visitor, bringing his or her own 
experiences, shared a piece of 
themselves — with a stranger, 
a friend, a favorite author. As 
they so often do, books sparked 
conversation after conversation 
between kindred spirits. The 
connectivity was tangible. 
Bubbles of shared experience 
popped up and engulfed 
visitors, reminding them just 
why books are so gratifying. 
The pleasant hum of chatter 
warmed the quickly chilling 
September air as the visitors

THE SECOND CITY

Improvising through the void.

At this point in my life, my gaze 

is fixed on what is ahead. New 
classes, new friends, interests and 
questions are moving me toward 
the next step. Whether that next 
thing is simply 
the reading I 
have for class 
tomorrow or, 
to the more 
distant future, 
graduation 
and 
grad 

school — I’m 
setting 
my 

course. 

While 
I 

progress toward the next dream 
(attainable or not), I’ve found it to 
be a valuable time for reflection. In 
pursuit of what is to come, I have 
revisited the dreams I abandoned 
along the way: past dreams that 
came from my childhood hobbies.

Back then, my way of thinking 

was very simple. It wasn’t always 
as structured and planned out as 
my life is now. My (hopeful) career 
in English started from my love for 
books at an early age. I didn’t know 
exactly where that would take me. 
At 6 years old I wasn’t planning for 
now. I was caught in the waves of 
my own simple dreaming, allowing 
them to guide me wherever they 
pleased.

I wanted to become a ballerina.
My weekly ballet classes were 

always packed with new music, 
skills and games. I loved the light 
pink slippers and soft tan tights. 
I grew a collection of leotards 
through my years of dancing, 
convinced I could never have 
too many. After overcoming my 
paralyzing case of stage fright, 
I even grew to love the spring 
recitals. Dance demanded energy 
and 
passion, 
both 
of 
which 

required an exploration into who 

I was and how I wanted to present 
myself to those around me.

Why now, at 20 years old, do I 

find myself reminiscing on a dream 
that is far gone and fairly irrelevant 
to my life now?

Because 
lately, 
in 
daily 

discussions of my future plans 
and goals, my past dreams have 
found their way back into my 
mind. While discussing this trend 
with friends around me who are 
facing similar life pressures of 
what life will be after undergrad, 
we all agree we have hobbies 
we wish we never quit. Friends 
of mine shared a vast array: 
piano, guitar, painting, ceramics, 
singing lessons and horseback 
riding. That isn’t to say what I am 
studying now or investing time 
into isn’t fulfilling. But recently, 
I’ve done a great deal of thinking 
about the hobby I wish I had 
never let go.

Two questions have emerged 

from the data collected from my 
small sample pool: Why did we 
give up these hobbies in the first 
place? And why are we now faced 
with some form of regret toward 
the decision to move on from our 
Tuesday night ballet classes or 
Sunday afternoon piano lessons?

In 
the 
midst 
of 
school, 

homework, 
team 
sports 
and 

clubs, there are always things we 
decide we must “let go.” I decided 
to spare myself of activities 
requiring 
personal, 
artistic 

expression in exchange for fully 
pursuing academics.

The 
problem 
is 
that 
the 

majority of the hobbies we push 
aside are some variation of art. 
As dynamic and unique people, 
we must find ways to express 
ourselves and at a young age, 
and art is our escape. Art, music 
lessons and dance classes foster 

creativity in ways the classroom 
doesn’t offer.

Yet, it’s the first thing we part 

with when time runs out. We turn 
to stacks of textbooks and course 
packs, abandoning the hobbies our 
artistic selves so desperately need.

Now let me aim to address why 

there is some form of regret while 
reminiscing. I think the appeal 
toward our past hobbies arrives 
when we witness others engaging 
in a hobby they have mastered.

I have met so many different 

students at this university studying 
different types of art and I always 
wonder what my life could have 
looked like if my childhood hobby 
had become my career. Watching 
artists who have devoted their 
lives to their art form is inspiring. 
I think we look back to our past 
hobbies and wish we could have 
done more to reach that level.

This leaves me stuck: stuck in 

this mindset that I’ve reached 
my limit, stuck with the belief 
that anything I start now won’t 
produce the results of something 
I started years ago and could have 
further pursued.

No dream is dead until you let 

yourself kill it.

I think it’s time I tie on my 

ballet shoes, roll up my tights and 
allow my childhood dreaming to 
lead me to new paths of greatness 
— 
whether 
that 
is 
simply 

admiring a hobby I once partook 
in or engaging in something 
entirely new myself. The freedom 
to dream at age 6 is still available 
to me now. There is potential I 
haven’t tapped into yet — maybe 
more available to me now than 
ever before.

Less adulting, more 
childhood dreams

Second City brings 
improv laughs to Ark

BAILEY 
KADIAN

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

On Sept. 16 and 17, Chicago’s 

legendary 
improv 
comedy 

group The Second City will visit 
Ann 
Arbor, 

performing 
at The Ark 
for 
the 

seventh 
consecutive 
year.

Formerly 

the home of 
well-known 
comedians 
such 
as 

Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey and 
Amy Poehler, The Second City’s 
touring cast is currently made 
up of six performers: Mark 
Campbell, Ross Taylor, Danny 
Catlow, 
Jo 
Scott, 
Andrew 

Bolduc and Claudia Wallace.

“Expect SNL-type comedy, 

usually around political and 
social current issues,” said Barb 
Chaffer-Authier, 
The 
Ark’s 

marketing director. “This isn’t 
the typical kind of event The 
Ark presents, since we normally 
present music, but we’ve really 
enjoyed 
having 
the 
troupe 

every year. It’s always popular 
with people.”

Since The Second City is an 

improv comedy group, each 
show is inherently different, 
playing off the given theme 
for the season. This season’s 
show is titled “Free Speech! 
(While Supplies Last),” based 
on American politics and the 
current election cycle. A press 
release from The Second City 
calls it “an irreverent look at 
America’s electoral insanity.”

The Ark is a small, intimate 

performance 
venue, 
usually 

hosting solo artists and small 
bands, so the seats sell out 
quickly. 
Chaffer-Authier 

estimates the show’s capacity 
at about 380 and said the small 
theater space makes The Ark 
an ideal setting for this kind of 
performance.

“It’s a nice-sized audience, 

there’s a lot of room for 
interaction 
between 
the 

performers and the audience,” 
she said. “No seat is more than 
about 40 feet from the stage. It’s 
a really popular event, both with 
students and the community 
who come out for it.”

Campus groups and residence 

halls often buy group tickets for 
performances like this one. LSA 
sophomore Caleb Kaczmarek 
attended 
the 
Second 
City 

performance last year with the 
LSA Honors Program.

“Second 
City’s 
impressive 

stage presence comes not only 
from the pride of their progenies 
such as Bill Murray and Tina 
Fey, but also their confidence 
that their live audience is 
waiting breathlessly for every 
next laugh,” Kaczmarek said.

In past years, all of these 

performances have sold out, 
and the Ark hopes to continue 
that trend this year, according 
to 
Chaffer-Authier. 
She 

encourages 
those 
interested 

to buy tickets in advance for 
the popular event. There are 
a limited number of tickets 
available at the student price for 
each night.

“The Second City is really an 

icon for comedy and improv, so 
it’s an opportunity for people 
to see this famous troupe in 
person without having to go to 
Chicago or Toronto,” she said. 
“They always are really on 
point with current topics, and 
it’s always a really fun evening.”

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

In a museum that often focuses 

on 
cutting-edge 
contemporary 

pieces, 
UMMA’s 
most 
recent 

exhibition came as a bit of a sur-
prise. To be fair, the museum is no 
stranger to variety. Detroit factory 
architecture? Of course. African 
scrap metal sculptures? Why not?

But ... Elizabeth Taylor? That 

was something new, and certainly 
unexpected. After all, the world 
of Serious Art hasn’t had much to 
do with celebrities since the age 
of Andy Warhol. In spite of this 
seeming mismatch, or perhaps 
because of it, photographer Cath-
erine Opie’s exhibition “700 Nimes 
Road,” a series of photographs of 
the interior of actress Elizabeth 
Taylor’s home, may have been the 
most intimate, thoughtful collec-
tion shown this year.

At first glance the photographs 

are sometimes dull, sometimes 
lustrous, capturing Taylor’s tables 
and rooms, her enviable closets 
and boudoirs. While the images 
are visually striking when taken 
as a whole, particularly in their 
artful arrangement of colors and 
textures, each individual photo-
graph feels a little off. In some, 
like those of Taylor’s dressing 
table or her famed jewelry collec-
tion, Opie has eschewed the easy, 
alluring snapshot in favor of more 
awkward lighting or an inferior 
vantage point. There’s something 
odd at work beneath the surface. 
Where’s the shine, the patina of 
fame, fortune and a life lived in the 
dazzling, blinding spotlight? The 
answer may lie in the gap between 
famed public persona and private 
life.

The 
incredible 
proliferation 

of “personal” information about 
celebrities, now and then, prom-
ises that you’re really getting to 
know the star, that they’re just 
like you. But do these images show 
anything about their subjects? And 

do the lives of the stars represent 
something relatable, if not attain-
able, to their admirers, or is it just 
a sweet escape, a chintzy mirage 
that revels in its own artificiality?

The nation may be fed up with 

plain old reality, beamed at them 
from the nightly news or shoved 
roughly through the mail slot each 
morning, but our obsession with 
“reality” is at an all-time high. Rat-
ings for dishy shows like “Keeping 
Up With The Kardashians” and 
competitions like “The Bachelor” 
keep on rising, promising audienc-
es a no-holds-barred leer into their 
subjects’ personal lives. They spin 
a web of false intimacy around the 
viewer, complete with tell-all con-
fessionals and dramatic, choreo-
graphed reveals.

Even LIFE Magazine, once wit-

ness-bearer to some of the last cen-
tury’s most significant events, now 
hawks glossy and expensive spe-
cial editions, mining their archives 
for 
never-before-seen 
glamour 

shots of the stars of yesteryear. The 
lacquered faces and taut, midcen-
tury physiques of these dead celeb-
rities simper next to Kourtney and 
Khloe on the rack at the check-out 
counter.

Into the lurid fray steps Cath-

erine Opie, a respected art pho-
tographer well known for her 
work depicting everything from 
queer subculture in Southern 
California to drab, sun-bleached 
planned communities. In 2010, 
she was given access to Taylor’s 
home while the lauded actress 
was away. Unlike Taylor, whose 
public appearances were marked 
by high drama and oodles of cos-
metics, the house was left just as 
it was: lived-in, not fixed up or 
polished for the camera.

The photographs have a curi-

ous untouched quality, as though 
Liz has just stepped out to run 
errands, leaving clothes and cos-
metics in benign disarray. The 
viewer feels like a teenage neigh-
bor, housesitting for the first 

time — running their fingers over 
the glamorous haute couture in 
the closet, fiddling with the TV 
remote and almost knocking 
over an Oscar on a crowded end 
table. The images are flat and two 
dimensional, of course, but they 
are remarkably tactile — gossa-
mer fabrics hanging alongside 
their ilk in an overstuffed walk-
in, the glint of sharp, sparkling 
jewels carefully placed in dusty 
shoeboxes and labeled with their 
bestower: 
“Michael 
Jackson, 

2005,” “Richard, 1961.”

If modern celebrity culture is 

a floodlit snapshot of life, show-
ing everything and revealing 
nothing, Opie’s exhibition is the 
photo negative, so to speak — 
the antidote. By focusing less on 
Taylor’s larger than life person-
ality, and more on the human, 
almost ordinary aspects of her 
home, a strange near-intimacy is 
achieved with Taylor, the absent 
subject whose presence none-
theless permeates each image, 
like musky perfume that lingers, 
stale, in the air long after the 
wearer has left.

Opie may not have delivered 

the glittering facade that charac-
terized Taylor’s life and mystique 
— a disappointment, perhaps, to 
some diehard fans. Touring the 
exhibition felt a lot like walking 
through a stranger’s home for 
the first time. The viewer wants 
to know the owner, but they’re 
always just out of sight. More 
conventional images of Tay-
lor, bathed in glamour, seem to 
promise the instant closeness 
of “reality,” where everything is 
somehow familiar and remote 
at the same time. Opie’s work 
gets closer to the uncomfortable 
truth. This home, its luxurious 
silks and carpet stains, piles of 
old pictures and years of accu-
mulated dust and memories, is 
that of a stranger. We may know 
“Liz Taylor,” but we don’t know 
this woman at all.

A conversation with 
author Nathan Hill 

CAROLYN GEARIG/Daily

“700 Nimes Road” was at UMMA for three months this summer.
An intimate ode 
to ‘Nimes Road’

BOOKS

By RENNIE PASQUINELLI

For the Daily

Nathan Hill was in Ann Arbor 

this Tuesday, reading from his 
debut novel, “The Nix,” at a beloved 
spot of every book enthusiast — 
Literati. In case you haven’t heard 
that name or title, Hill’s “The Nix” 
became available in books stores 
across the world in late August 
and received a warm welcome in 
the literary community. Actually, 
“warm welcome” may well be 
an 
understatement. 
Before 
it 

was even published, “The Nix” 
had been compared to works by 
several groundbreaking novelists, 
including but not limited to, John 
Irving and Charles Dickens. And, 
just to reiterate: “The Nix” is Hill’s 
first novel.

“The Nix” is 600 pages filled 

with what Hill refers to as a 
magical bag Hermione Granger 
could pull anything out of. It’s 
a story of many characters and 
several plots, but centers around 
a video game-addicted English 
professor 
(Samuel) 
and 
an 

estranged relationship with his 
mother, Faye. The novel covers 
the Chicago riots of 1968, a mother 
trapped in a suburban lifestyle in 
the 1980s, as well as the lives of 
the modern college student and 
professor.

Hill’s 
warmer-than-warm 

welcome 
transcended 
the 

reviews he’s received for “The 
Nix” at Literati. Those who were 
fortunate enough to attend his 
reading couldn’t get enough of 
both Hill and his book. Before he 
began reading from “The Nix,” 
Hill quoted an email from a fan 
that he described as a reason being 
a writer is so rewarding, which 
included the lines “I am old. I have 
read many books. Yours is among 
my favorites. Please do not take 10 
years to write the next one. I am 
82.”

The Daily had the chance to sit 

down and talk to Hill about the 
novel, his sudden rise to fame, and 
what we can expect next.

---
TMD: “The Nix” took you 

about 12 years to write, which 
is about a quarter of your life. 
In a previous interview, you 
said you poured all of your good 
ideas into this book, your first 
book. Why write one book? Was 
it difficult to make all of those 
ideas cohesive?

NH: Yeah, it was. To the first 

point, about why writing one book, 
I guess I put all of these ideas into 
the book and chopped stuff out 
where they didn’t belong. The first 
draft was 1,002 pages long, and 
the final draft is 620, so a lot of 
stuff got cut out. Maybe that stuff 
might find another appearance 
in a book somewhere down the 
line. But really I was just trying 
to find something out in the 
world that would be confusing, 
or interesting, or would make me 
mad, or I wouldn’t know how I 
felt about it, and I would think, 
“Could I use that in ‘The Nix’?” 
It became sort of like the filter 
that you see the world through. 
Anytime I had a really good idea, I 
felt like I could use it, and I didn’t 
censor myself. I just put it in there. 
For better or worse. It took a long 
time to write the book because of 
it. But at the same time I feel really 
happy, because I feel like it’s just 
packed with things that hopefully 
make people think.

Of course. And I’ve seen 

some fan tweets to you, one that 
said there is a true sentence on 
every page of “The Nix.” I’m 
sure that felt good to hear.

That was a cool one. I don’t 

know, it was mostly like I was 
trying to write a book that I would 
really like to read. And those are 
the kinds of books I like to read; 
the ones that have interesting 
characters and are also full of 
ideas.

That kind of brings me to my 

next question. Presumably you 
read a couple of books while 
you were writing “The Nix.” 
Which ones would you say were 
most influential to writing it?

In terms of content, the books I 

list in my acknowledgments page. 
I did a lot of research, especially 
about the 1968 section, because 
of course I did not live through 
that, so those books were really 
important 
to 
me. 
Especially 

Norman Mailer’s book, “Miami 
and the Siege of Chicago.” It was 
interesting, because most books 
about Chicago in 1968 are histories 
told by history professors. They’re 
really useful and helpful, but to see 
Normal Mailer do it, I mean he’s a 
literary writer, and to see someone 
approach it from that direction 
with the purpose of telling a story, 
rather than the purpose of telling 
a history, was really helpful to me. 
I read those books until I felt like 
I knew enough about the period to 
write about it myself.

I assume it takes a lot of 

confidence in your knowledge 
base to feel comfortable writing 
about something you didn’t 
experience first hand.

So, my wife is a classical 

musician. And classical musicians 
have this phrase where they 
rehearse something until they 
have it “under their fingers.” You 
know, which is kind of like, in 
the body. You work and work on 
a certain run until you just kind 
of have it, and don’t have to think 
about it too much. For me, I did 
research until I had it under my 
fingers, until I could write about 
the time period without having to 
consult all the time. I just felt like 
I could do it.

How 
did 
you 
tap 
into 

womanhood in an era you didn’t 
live through?

Again, a lot of research helped 

me out. There was a book called 
“Young, White, and Miserable” 
that I liked a lot, about young 
women in the ’50s. That gave me 
a lot of good ideas. And, (“The 
Nix”) is Samuel’s retelling of the 
whole thing. It was almost like I 
was writing Faye through Samuel’s 
eyes. Kind of like what he would 
think. And he’s, of course, looking 
at it through a great distance in the 
future. Really it was just looking 
around, too. I found websites 
that had old advertisements for 
woman’s beauty products, and they 
were just so transparently sexist. 
And you’re like, “I cannot believe 
this was normal.” So to have Faye 
working against that, and Samuel 
writing it with our eyes today felt 
like a really nice tension.

Right. And I’ve heard you 

say you have felt connected to 
the character Samuel, because 
you played a lot of “World of 
Warcraft” in a period of time 
where you felt in limbo as a 
writer. What was that like for 
you?

That was a time when I just 

finished grad school and moved to 
New York. My first month there, 
all of my (writing I had done in 
grad school) was stolen. I was 
really sad about that, like really, 
really sad, and a buddy of mine 
suggested that we play this video 
game together. He just wanted to 
keep an eye on me I think. You 
know, you can chat through the 
game. And I guess it was just a 
couple years where I was trying 
to write what eventually became 
this book but in a very different 
form, and it wasn’t going very 
well. And I wasn’t making any 
money in New York. I was there 
working at a poetry nonprofit, so 
you can imagine how much the 
salary was.

So I was just barely treading 

water in New York, and the 
writing wasn’t going very well, 
and I was getting rejected all over 
the place. But, I was playing this 
game, and I could be really good 
at this game, right? So I felt like 
in the rest of my life I was failing, 
but I was not failing at this game. 
So it made me play it a lot, for a 
little while, until I finally realized 
I was spending way too much 
time doing it. I gave it up cold 
turkey one day and really launched 
myself into the book. That feeling 
of the video game replacing, I don’t 
want to say replacing real life, but 
the video game becomes a place 
where you find meaning where 
you lack meaning elsewhere. That 
idea stuck with me, and it’s in 
both of the characters Samuel and 
Pwnage.

Well, this is your first novel. 

Before it came out, you were 
compared to John Irving and 
he compared you to Charles 
Dickens. 
Countries 
bid 
on 

publication rights, which is 
rare for a first book. How are 
you taking all of this positive 
reception and recognition?

A lot of people have asked me 

that question, and I still don’t know 
how to answer because it still feels 
so strange, you know? For the time 
that I was writing the book — for 
the years and years it took — the 
only person who knew anything 
about what I was doing was my 
wife. I would read her pages. At 
first she requested me to read 
pages; I was always very shy about 
my first drafts. But, eventually, I 
read her a few pages and she said 
she really liked them and wanted 
to hear a couple more, and that just 
became our routine. For 10 years 
you’re working on a book, and one 
person in the world knows about it, 
so there’s this fear that you’ll send it 
out into the world and it’s not going 
to make any sense to anybody. 
That’s not happening. That people 
are saying nice things about it is 
really gratifying. And kind of a big 
relief, too. The 10 years would’ve 
been well-spent no matter what, 
but I’m glad that the 10 years is 
meaningful to other people, too.

You clearly view writing as 

something internally beneficial 
as opposed to just rewarding 
because of external praise.

You can’t work on something for 

this long and have all of your hopes 
pinned on it being published. It 
will just drive you crazy and you 
won’t do very good work. What I 
discovered, sometime around the 
time that I quit “Warcraft” and 
really started getting into a routine 
with the writing, is that there 
needs to be something (in) the 
writing itself that is intrinsically 
valuable to you. And for me, writing 
became the place where I would go 
to try to figure out my emotions 
and things I was confused about. 
The way I’ve been comparing it 
to lately is to someone who keeps 
a garden. Nobody thinks their 
garden is a failure if a bunch of 
other people don’t see it. Nobody 
keeps a garden to get famous. It felt 
like that. Part of the prerequisite 
for writing all the scenes I wrote in 
the book was that I had to find joy 
in it. I had to enjoy it, I had to like 
it. There needed to be something 
about writing that scene that was 
pleasurable to me, or interesting 
to me in some way. That’s how 
it became worth it intrinsically. 
Beyond any of the praise, it was a 
good project to undergo in a cheesy 
personal growth kind of way.

I’ve read that you have 

considered yourself a writer 
since second grade, when you 
were writing “Choose your own 
adventure” 
novels 
yourself. 

But is there a book that really 
convinced you to become a 
writer?

I’ll tell you two books that are 

radically different from each other 
that made me feel like “I want to 
do that.” The first one is called 
“Sixty Stories.” It’s a collection of 
short stories by Donald Barthelme. 
He’s an absurdist, avant-garde 
writer. He’s just hilarious. And 
goofy. He’s a weird combination of 
high-intellect and high-absurdity 
crashing into each other. And 
you’ll finish a story and be like 
“What in the world was that?!” I 
found him in college, and at the 
time I had become an English 
major and was reading a lot of 
really ponderous prose in some of 
my other classes, and I found him 
and just found him delightful. 
That sense of humor, I just love. 
The second one is Virginia Woolf, 
“Mrs. Dalloway” and “To the 
Lighthouse.” I didn’t read her 
until grad school. Oh my god. I 
love the way she dives into her 
characters’ brains. The tone of the 
novel is the voice of the character 
from the inside. I love that so 
much. You know how you have 
certain bands that you listen to 
that hit you in the right time of 
your life? Those two for me were 
the bands that hit me at the right 
time.

Can we expect another magic 

bag of ideas and stories from 
you in another 10 years?

Yeah, I don’t know if it’s going 

to be … No, it totally will be that. 
I’ve started working on another 
thing, and I’m only about 50 pages 
into some exploratory material. 
But, the things I’m stuffing into 
the bag right now are marriage, 
authenticity, gentrification and 
the ’90s. That’s in the stew right 
now. We’ll see, we’ll see.

and hop 
into a red 
Mercedes. 
The next 
three-and-a-half minutes 
follow a similar trend, with 
an array of shots of YG, 
Drake and Kamaiyah rapping 
from moving convertibles, 
drinking Hennessey, popping 
champagne, dancing next the 
the cars they were previously 
rapping out of and even in 
Kamaiyah’s case, receiving 
foot massages from really 
buff shirtless dudes. There is 
also a conspicuous lack of a 
helicopter in the final three 
and a half minutes, which is, 
in its own way, lavish.

Over-the-top displays of 

wealth are nothing new in 
the rap video world. So much 
so that a video without some 
excessive display of wealth is 
considered avant-garde. This 

video is not avant-garde. It is, 
however, a perfect match for 
the single and the album.

Still Brazy is an homage to a 

simpler time, a West Coast ’90s 
rap album with skits and jokes 
and funky baselines. It’s also 
an album made in 2016, with 
references to Aisha Curry, 
Drake verses and rampant 
anonymous internet hate. 
“Why You Always Hatin?,” a 
happy song about haters, is the 
albums’ mascot.

The duality of the album 

allows the cliché-but-not 
video to work. There are 
rented drop tops, but there are 
also men giving foot massages 
when, unfortunately, the 
prevailing lavish rap video 

rarely has men in subservient 
roles. There’s are bottles of 
champagne popping over 
lobster dinners, but an oddly 
disarming set of shots with 
YG and his friends goofing 
around in a parking lot. This 
is a YG video, but people are 
enjoying themselves.

This video isn’t anything 

artistically groundbreaking, 
but in between the cars and 
money and liquor you can see 
YG winking at us, making a 
little joke that plays off the 
fact that, on the surface, the 
video is so derivative. It’s a self 
awareness we want to see, but 
rarely do when paired with 
exuberant displays of wealth.

A slim, colorful paperback, 

written 
in 
French 
by 
a 

Congolese transplant learning 
German in Austria, didn’t look 
like a breakout hit when it was 
published in 2014. But that, of 
course, is just what playwright 
and 
poet 
Fiston 
Mwanza 

Mujila’s debut novel, “Tram 
83,” became. The book’s fast-
paced prose and incantatory, 
almost 
violent 
bursts 
of 

language were a revelation 
to the Francophone literary 
scene, and the awards began 
piling up within the year: 
winner of the Etisalat Prize for 
first African novel, shortlisted 
for the Prix du Monde, and now 
the novel’s English translation 
has been longlisted for the 2016 
Man Booker Prize, one of the 
most prestigious awards in the 
English language.

The Michigan Daily caught 

up with Mujila, a native of 
Lubumbashi in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, in an email 
exchange while he enjoyed a 
brief respite from international 
touring in his new home of 
Graz, Austria. We were assisted 
by Mujila’s eminently skillful 
translator, Roland Glasser, who 

also translated “Tram 83” into 
the exquisitely worded English 
language edition.

The novel follows the uneasy 

friendship of Lucien, a troubled 
writer escaping violence in 
the countryside, and Requiem, 
a gleeful ne’er-do-well who 
boozes and womanizes by day, 
and schemes and steals by 
night. Lucien has arrived by 
rusting colonial train in the 
capital of an unnamed central-
African country, teeming with 
Chinese investors and African 
workers, Portuguese musicians 
and “baby chicks and single 
mamas” from no man’s land. 
Mujila describes all visitors 
to the city and its popular 
nightclub, 
“Tram 
83,” 
as 

“tourists” with a cynical wink.

“The tourists belong to every 

nationality. People come from 
all over the world in search of 
the stone (minerals),” he wrote. 
“There are not only Westerners 
but also thousands of African 
tourists to be found in the 
nooks and crannies of the City-
State. I wanted to reappraise 
globalization by bringing in all 
these different populations.”

Yet one European visitor, 

a 
Swiss 
publisher 
named 

Malingeau, is a source not only 
of exploitation, but also of the 

African exuberance and joie de 
vivre that brings the city to life.

“A character in a novel 

can slip out of the author’s 
control,” Mujila wrote. “The 
publisher is one such example. 
He considers himself African 
and finds pleasure in the 
carnival-like drinking sprees 
and hedonism of this bar called 
Tram 83. In his own opinion, 
African literature should be a 
joyous thing, since life is also 
to be found in rumba, jazz, and 
the other delights of Tram 83.”

All of the characters live or 

die by the caprices of the mine 
— the unstable mineral deposit 
outside town, surrounded by 
armed guards and constantly 
changing hands — though it 
promises great wealth for few 
and unfathomable chaos for all 
who live there. The looming 
presence of the mine dominates 
the novel, casting its ominous 
shadow over the characters in 
this improbable place.

“The phenomenon of the 

mine tackled in the novel is 
timeless and universal,” Mujila 
wrote.

But it also speaks to the 

desperation that characterizes 
central Africa today, wracked 
as it is by conflict over minerals 
and resources.

Mujila shines with 
debut novel ‘Tram 83’

PONTAS AGENCY

Fiston Mwanza Mujila is a Congolese novelist currently living in Austria.

“I wanted to provide some 

food for thought — the novel 
contains several portions — 
about what it means to be 
young in a country in a state 
of war or under a dictatorship. 
In the Congo, over half the 
population are young people in 
a country ravaged by decades of 
dictatorship and war. But there 
is in this youth — even when 
it is obliged to go down into 
the mines or other black holes 
of existence to earn a crust — 
an extraordinary resilience, a 
desire for freedom and a call for 
a new world,” Mujila wrote.

The book’s greatest virtue, 

and perhaps the key to its 
international success, is the 
throbbing 
musicality 
of 
its 

language. The prose is visceral, 
as sensuous and vivid as a live 
performance — not surprising, 
considering both the surfeit of 
talented Congolese musicians, 
from 
rumberos 
to 
rappers, 

and 
Mujila’s 
own 
musical 

background. 
This 
connected 

the 
novel 
to 
international 

traditions, 
particularly 
jazz, 

and to the author’s own musical 
heritage in the DRC.

“Singing contributes to the 

recognition of an individual 
within 
a 
group, 
to 
the 

legitimization of their exploits 
or 
their 
actions,” 
Mujila 

explained. “The Luba people 

of the Congo practiced kasala, 
an oratorical art in which an 
individual is praised for their 
merits, or to crown important 
events at court, be they happy 
or sad. This oratorical form was 
common in ancestral Africa.”

Not much happens in the 

novel, so to speak, and you can 
feel it in the plodding, rhythmic 
languor 
of 
the 
subtropical 

air. Lucien is stuck, waiting 
for something to happen — a 
visa, a publication, a war. It’s 
a 
universal 
feeling, 
known 

to writers everywhere, and 
Lucien fluctuates between the 
tantalizing misadventures of 
his swindler friend and his own 
earnest scribblings. It is not 
Lucien himself, but the fiendish 
vitality of his surroundings that 
drives the novel forward.

The success of “Tram 83” 

has affected not just awards 
and fanfare, but a series of 
global translations into Hebrew, 
Greek, 
Catalan, 
Dutch 
and 

Swedish, to name just a few. The 
book’s afterlife will now simmer 
on at bookstores in Tel Aviv and 
bedside tables in Barcelona.

As 
Mujila’s 
African 

expatriate 
contemporaries, 

from 
Nigeria’s 
Chimamanda 

Ngozi Adichie to Zimbabwe’s 
NoViolet Bulawayo, proliferate 
in the West, he will continue to 
bring his distinctive, musical 

voice into the fray. While the 
media 
often 
celebrates 
the 

so-called “African Renaissance” 
of literature as though it runs 
into a concrete wall at the edges 
of the vast continent, what 
defines Mujila’s prose is not its 
provincialism, but its diversity, 
its shape-shifting nature and 
forcefully unfocused lens on the 
world.

“The child is not born from 

a tree. He comes from his 
mother’s belly,” Mujila wrote. 
“In 
Lubumbashi, 
the 
town 

of my birth, and throughout 
the Congo I’m sure, a child is 
often identified in relation to 
his parents. ‘Whose child is 
that?’ people often ask. I feel 
no unease at being considered 
an African or Congolese author, 
even if I don’t write in the name 
of a nationality, a people, a city, 
a country or a continent.”

In many ways, as is true 

for all writers, Mujila’s youth 
in a vital, turbulent African 
capital is the pounding heart 
behind his work. But “Tram 83” 
does not define the DRC, and 
Lubumbashi fails to encapsulate 
the essence of Mujila, to close in 
around him like a hermetically 
sealed chamber. He writes as an 
African and as a European, an 
expatriate and a native son — 
perhaps, simply, as a citizen of 
the world. 

ARTIST IN PROFILE

SINGLE REVIEW

Until this year, I’d never 

heard a Sampha solo track, but 
not because the British R&B/
electronic 
artist hasn’t 
made any. 
Although he 
released EPs 
Sundnaza and 
Dual, in 2010 
and 2013, 
respectively, 
I’d 
unknowingly limited myself 
to his features on “Too Much” 
and “The Motion” off Drake’s 
Nothing Was The Same, “Saint 
Pablo,” the latest addition to 
Kanye’s The Life of Pablo and 
most recently, “Alabama” off 
Frank Ocean’s visual album, 
Endless.

But a feature spot “Blood 

on Me” is not. It’s heavy 
and enveloping, employing 
an eccentric yet somehow 

organic piano and cowbell 
combination. It’s hectic and 
raw as the artist literally 
pants his way through the 
first verse. It’s energetic and 
angry, leaving the listener 
unsure whether to samba or 
scream.

Sampha’s expectedly 

stunning vocals have never 
been accompanied by this 
kind of unexpectedly urgent 
production. And now that I 
know what he can do on his 
own, I’m only more excited for 
the release of his debut album, 
Process.
