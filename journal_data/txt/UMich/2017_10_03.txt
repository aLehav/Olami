A recent study conducted 

by 
University 
of 
Michigan 

researchers has found 20 percent 
of adolescents and teenagers have 
sustained a concussion at least 
once. 

This 
research 
project 

was directed under the 2016 
Monitoring the Future study, a 
broader project conducted under 
the University, which explores the 
behaviors of American students 
from 
kindergarten 
through 

university level. This study is 
funded by the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse and is conducted 
by 
the 
Institute 
for 
Social 

Research at the University.

This specific study, “Prevalence 

of 
Concussion 
Among 
US 

Adolescents 
and 
Correlated 

Factors,” was conducted using 

data from the MTF 2016 survey, 
a project that occurs annually and 
conducts an in-school survey in 
grades 8, 10, and 12. In this 2016 
survey, 49.8 percent of students 
were male and 46.8 percent were 
white. The age range of students 
surveyed was 12-18 years old, the 
modal age being 16 years old. 

University researcher Philip 

T. Veliz, one of the authors of the 
report, explained this data has had 
an important role in solidifying a 
base knowledge on this issue.

“Part of this study was finding a 

baseline number of what the self-
reported/diagnosed concussion is 
within the adolescent population, 
and then starting to track it,” Veliz 
said.

He 
emphasized 
the 

implications of this research 
will only be inferable with time, 
as they continue to survey and 
record whether there are long-

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs 
met 
on 
Monday 

to 
discuss 
methods 
of 

encouraging more interaction 
in meetings, budget concerns 
and award recipients. SACUA 
also 
mentioned 
possible 

solutions 
to 
the 
textbook 

availability problem campus 
faced at the beginning of the 
semester.

Members first spoke about 

ways to improve the structure 
of 
meetings. 
To 
address 

comments made in previous 
Senate 
Assembly 
meetings, 

members considered moving 
meeting locations to rooms 
more conducive to interactive 
discussion. Rooms in Rackham 
Graduate 
Building 
were 

suggested, which led to a 
motion 
to 
re-examine 
the 

committee’s budget.

The discussion then turned 

to the issue students had buying 
books at the beginning of the 
semester, specifically with the 
relocation of Ulrich’s. SACUA 
Senate Secretary David Potter, 
a classical studies professor, 
believes 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan needs to handle the 
textbook availability problem 
better, as it created difficulties 
for students. 

“We need to discuss the 

failure 
of 
the 
University 

to react to changes in the 
bookstore 
market; 
Ulrich’s 

closed and students were left 
to find books whatever way 
they could,” Potter said. “Not 
having bookstores on campus 
where students can buy used 
books is putting our students 
at a grave disadvantage.”

SACUA 
Chair 
Robert 

Ortega, a professor in the 
School of Social Work, agreed 
with Potter and noted the 
impact the problem had on 
faculty as well.

“What 
happens 
to 
the 

faculty 
is 
they’re 
moving 

forward while students are 
still trying to get books,” 
Ortega said. “It’s a dilemma for 
instructors as well.”

To combat the problem, 

members mentioned a central 
location for students to pick 
up books, focusing more on 
electronic books and having 
a library representative talk 
to the assembly. They also 

suggested 
a 
University-run 

bookstore 
to 
alleviate 
the 

issues caused by privately 
owned bookstores. Students 
picketed administratrors for 
a 
student-run 
bookstrore 

through 
the 
`70s 
due 
to 

exorbitant textbook costs, but 
those calls died down as the 
online market due. 

Members 
moved 
on 
to 

the

While most University of 

Michigan students spend their 
gamedays tailgating, Business 
sophomore Gabi de Coster 
spends her Saturdays going 
back home to Grosse Pointe, 
Mich., to work on crafting 
scents for her aromatherapy 
company, MONTA.

MONTA is a health-and-

wellness business that utilizes 
all-natural products to create 
unique products like scented 
rollerballs, bath soaks and 
body sprays.

“I’m taking inspiration from 

the place the products are 
named after and translating 
that into scent,” de Coster said. 
“It’s the colors, feelings and 
emotions that I tie to those 
important places in my life that 
are relayed in the plants I use 
to make the scents.”

Originating in a South Quad 

Residence Hall dorm room, 
MONTA now has a dedicated 
studio in de Coster’s home. 
The extra space was needed 
to keep up with additional 
products and rising demands,

Council members demand expedited installation of parking garage protective railing 

City Council was held in a 

somber mood Monday after a 
gunman killed 59 people in Las 
Vegas and a 56-year old man 
fell from the parking structure 
at the corner of South Fourth 
Avenue 
and 
East 
William 

Street.

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

expressed frustration at the 

lack of coordinated response 
to the Las Vegas incident, the 
deadliest mass shooting in U.S. 
history.

“The fact that this occurs 

in our country, I believe it is a 
national disgrace,” Taylor said. 
“Other nations are able to deal 
with it as a matter of culture, a 
matter of legislation. I believe 
we should do so as well.”

He also lamented the incident 

at 
the 
parking 
structure, 

the third in a month after a 

22-year-old man also fell from 
the same parking lot Sept. 7 and 
an 81-year-old man was found 
dead in the Huron River Sept. 
20.

“It is a tragedy of mental 

illness, of community health,” 
Taylor said. “It’s something 
we need to focus on. We need 
to make sure that people who 
apply for help receive them.”

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski, 
D-Ward 
5, 

urged residents to engage in 

community 
activities 
that 

will distract from the sadness 
and forge bonds with other 
residents.

“This has been a heavy day 

for a lot of us in the community,” 
Warpehoski said. “In heavy 
times like these, it’s important 
to find things that give us life.”

Warpehoski added there are 

signs of hope. He explained 
the city is going to expedite 
the installation of railing on

LSA sophomore Jane Sheedy 

came to school this fall excited to 
start composting in her off-campus 
apartment. Her hometown doesn’t 
offer composting services and after 
learning about harmful methane 
release that results from putting 
organic materials into landfills last 
year, she was thrilled to learn Ann 
Arbor does.

“We’ve got some mixing bowls 

in our freezer and any time we’ve 
got something compostable, we 
put it in there,” Sheedy said. “So 
vegetable scraps or if something 
goes moldy… or something like 
that. And when that’s full, there’s a 
bin behind our apartment complex 
that we can just empty the bowl 
into.”

From there, the city of Ann 

Arbor takes over. A roadside pick-
up service picks up the compost 
much like it picks up regular trash 
or recycling and takes it to the city’s 
compost facility located only about 
five miles from campus.

As it turns out, the facility is also 

the site of a local controversy.

In 2010, the city of Ann Arbor 

decided to award its compost

Students attempt C.C. Little rename 
with sign recognizing Black alum

Radfun claims building name change to honor first Black female student at ‘U’

Students 
attempted 
to 

rename the C.C. Little Science 
Building 
Sunday 
night 
by 

covering the sign with a new 
sign that read “Mary Henrietta 
Graham,” the first Black woman 
to attend and graduate from the 
University of Michigan. The 
University has since removed 
the sign.

The 
renaming 
attempt 

followed 
an 
LSA 
Student 

Government 
panel 
that 

discussed removing the name 
of former University president, 
C.C. Little, who worked in 
eugenics 
primarily 
against 

women of color. Protesters 
took to the panel and voiced 

their frustration over the lack 
of University buildings named 
after women of color and the 
honoring of a man who aided 
eugenics.

The 
University 
group 

Radfun, 
which 
describes 

itself as “radical anticapitalist 
deviants & forum of united 
nonconformists” posted a photo 
of the sign on Facebook with the 
caption “Our buildings should 
be named by us, and never 
named after the Oppressor!”

In 
an 
email 
statement, 

Radfun 
called 
for 
campus 

community members to start 
referring to it as the Mary 
Henrietta 
Graham 
Science 

Building.

“The 
decision 
for 
this 

name was based on research 
and 
support 
provided 
by 

several groups at UM that are 
implicated in the fight for social 
justice,” Radfun wrote. “We 
can speak to why our collective 
decided to support the name of 
MHG, which was because there 

has been a massive outcry 
against the naming of the CC 
Little building. Renaming it 
ourselves and after a woman 
of color makes the most 
sense because reclaims the 
right of marginalized to 
UM.”

The 
University 
hasn’t 

commented officially on the 
sign or its removal.

“We don’t know why the 

sign was removed, but it 
honestly make (sic) sense 
that they did because they 
only care about student 
dissent if it works for the 
brand 
they’re 
trying 
to 

protect,” Radfun stated.

The 
petition 
circling 
to 

rename the building has just 
came to over 1,000 signatures.

MOMS M ARCH
The University of Michigan’s chapter 

of College Republicans painted the 
Rock Sunday night to send a message of 
solidarity to the minority groups that have 
been targeted by recent hate crimes on 
campus.

Two weeks ago, three Black students in 

West Quad Residence Hall had their door 
name tags vandalized with racial slurs. 
That same weekend, other racist graffiti 
were discovered on a downtown mural, 
and posters reading “Free Dylann Roof” 
were found throughout campus. In the 
weeks before that, anti-Latino sentiments 
were found painted on the Rock, and a 
local skate park was vandalized with racist 
and anti-Semitic graffiti.

Last week, several protests occurred 

throughout campus as a call to action 
and to draw attention to these events. 
Protesters blocked the C.C. Little bus 
station, flooded the room where a panel 
spoke about changing the name of the C.C. 
Little Science Building and sat with School 
of Public Health master’s candidate Dana 
Greene as he kneeled on the Diag for nearly 
24 hours.

University President Mark Schlissel 

wrote in a statement that he supports 
Greene’s right to kneel.

“I share with many the belief that 

our nation does not always live up to its 
highest ideals, including the equal rights 
we hold dear,” Schlissel wrote. “To me, the 
American Flag represents many things, 
including those very rights. I support 
(Greene’s) right to engage in peaceful 
protest.”

Like many other organizations on 

campus, the club paints the Rock every 
year, according to LSA junior Amanda 
Delekta, vice president of College 
Republicans. However, the group decided 
to be a little more purposeful with its 
paintbrushes this year, in light of recent 
campus incidents.

“This year with the rhetoric on campus 

and some of the hateful incidents that have 
occurred, we wanted to create a really 
clear message of what our group stands for 
and disassociate from some of the other 
groups that tend to get lumped in with us,” 
Delekta said.

Scholarship, which is a $5,000 
need-based scholarship given 
to 
undergraduate 
students 

and that can be can be divided 
between one or two recipients. 
This year, Ortega motioned for 
the award to be given to two 
students with the money split 
evenly among them.

SACUA 
member 
Dave 

Wright, 
an 
accounting 

professor in the Ross School 
of Business, brought up the 
introduction of a campaign 
to raise more money for the 
award, since the committee 
only grants the scholarship 
every four years.

“There are three years of 

students who aren’t eligible 
for that scholarship,” Wright 
said. “If we had more money in 
the pot we could be doing this 
every year.”

As 
further 
support 
for 

dividing the award between 
two 
students, 
Ortega 

mentioned splitting the money 
would have less of an impact on 
the winning students’ financial 
aid. This ushered in further 
discussion on amending the 
scholarship. SACUA member 
Ruth Carlos, a professor in the 
Medical School, believed the 
award should not negatively 
affect a student’s financial aid.

“We’re 
just 
substituting 

one grant for another grant,” 
Carlos said.

as the company has found its 
way into retailers across the 
country. MONTA has even 
been featured on Buzzfeed, 
obtaining a spot on its “26 
Awesome 
Beauty 
Products 

You Didn’t Know You Could 
Get At Urban Outfitters.”

De Coster’s business is a 

solo operation; she manages 
all the marketing, branding, 
production and social media. 
She finds she needs separate 
calendars 
for 
school 
and 

MONTA to keep up with the 
volume of work.

“Balance is still something 

I’m trying to figure out, 
honestly,” de Coster said. “You 
have to make a lot of sacrifices 
and really love what you’re 
giving up some normal college 
experiences for.”

The business was born out 

of personal struggles in de 
Coster’s life. While in junior 
high, de Coster experienced 
medical issues that forced 
her to be more cautious about 
what she puts in her body. 
This, in conjunction with an 
extensive leg injury obtained 
four days into de Coster’s 
freshman year, provided the 
inspiration for MONTA.

Instead of sitting in her 

dorm 
room, 
however, 
de 

Coster 
used 
aromatherapy 

as an outlet for her negative 
emotions and created the first 
MONTA products.

“MONTA 
was 
born 
to 

express my longing for nature 
and to relay those emotions 
in 
another 
language,” 
de 

Coster said. “There is a faith 
component, as it expresses my 
relationship with God also; I 

can look outside and view his 
ultimate creativity.”

MONTA 
has 
partnered 

with other businesses to craft 
new, communal products. One 
such collaboration is with Los 
Angeles based fashion line 
Gracemade, where the two 
will create a rollerball entitled 
“Be Still.” De Coster will also 
be working with Alex Elle, 
writer and self-care advocate, 
and Tara Mackey, owner of 
The Organic Life.

Jasmine Rennie, creative 

director 
and 
owner 
of 

Gracemade, chose to work 
with de Coster due to a shared 
faith-driven background and 
mutual appreciation for each 
other’s brands.

“She just has a beautiful 

story; her whole concept of 
creating her scents was based 
on her own faith journey 
and things and places she 
experienced in her discovery 
of who God was in her life,” 
Rennie said. “She has a great 
mind and a great spirit about 
her and it shows throughout 
everything she does in her 
company.”

As MONTA begins to gain 

more traction, de Coster is 
planning to expand the size 
of her operations. She intends 
on taking advantage of the 
Business 
School’s 
student 

facilities, like the Zell Lurie 
Center for Entrepreneurship, 
to 
help 
her 
make 
this 

transition.

As her business begins to 

grow, so will her workload. 
Business 
sophomore 
Max 

Devooght, a friend of de 
Coster, believes de Coster’s 
work ethic is well suited for 
this change.

“Everybody’s sitting there 

and enjoying themselves on 
gameday and she’s building 
a business,” Devooght said. 
“Her business is literally an 
extension of herself; I didn’t 
know it was possible to be that 
connected to a business.”

MONTA has not only been an 

outlet for de Coster’s emotions, 
but for her artistic side as well. 
She sees her products as a unique 
blend of business and creativity 
and feels it will not be easy for 
anyone else to replicate.

“I consider MONTA half 

business, half art,” de Coster 
said. “There is no one else that 
has the same design eye or 
personal experiences as I do, so I 
like to refer to the products as my 
sensory diary and no one else 
can write my diary for me.”

facility to an outside source. It put 
out a Request for Proposal — known 
in the city as an RFP — looking for 
a company to contract the compost 
management. WeCare Organics, 
which was then based in New York 
but since merged with Arkansas-
based Denali Water Solutions, 
answered that call. In February of 
2011, it took over the contract and 
has been managing Ann Arbor’s 
compost since then.

This summer, that contract 

was up and Ann Arbor once again 
put out an RFP for a composting 
contractor. WeCare submitted a 
request to renew their contract, but 
this time, the Holland, Mich.-based 
Cocoa Corporation also turned in a 
proposal.

It did not receive an interview or 

site visit from the city. 

According to Cocoa Corporation 

CEO Adam Brent, his company felt 
its case was persuasive. Not only did 
he think it was the best company for 
the job, but he also claimed WeCare 
was grossly mismanaging the site.

“From my perspective, there 

is mismanagement going on at 
the facility, and then the contract 
was awarded to a company who is 
certainly going to continue what I 
believe is business as usual, which is 
‘we get paid for the tipping (service 
of accepting unsorted compost 
material), and we’ll just pile it up 
and leave it out back like everyone 
else is doing and maybe one day 
it’ll turn into compost,’” Brent 
said. “The city of Ann Arbor has 
an excellent compost facility … and 
the resource is being, in my opinion, 
squandered.” 

Brent and his CFO Richard 

Hornstein based their allegations 
on the fact that WeCare was not 
grinding large material or moving 
enough of their compost off the 
facility. Grinding is an important 
part of composting because it breaks 
down large woody materials so 
they can help along the composting 
process.

Grinding and moving compost 

is a big part of Cocoa Corporation’s 
business model — it sells most of 
the compost it accumulates to local 
farmers as soil fertilizer — and 
it claims it was part of WeCare’s 
original contract, too.

“The requirement is, in the 

contract with the city of Ann 
Arbor, is that the compost facility 
is supposed to grind all the 
woody material and remove all 
the contaminants,” Brent said. 

“If you go to the site, none of that 
is taking place. In the RFP, we 
requested through the Freedom 
of Information Act after we had 
been denied the contract their 
contract … it lists that they have 
two grinders. Grinders would be 
what breaks down the material. 
They don’t have two grinders 
there and the one grinder they do 
have has been broken two years, 
according to the employee that we 
spoke to back in August. So they’re 
not following through on their 
initial contract.”

Brent 
and 
Hornstein 
also 

expressed 
frustration 
that 

WeCare doesn’t seem to be giving 
back as much revenue to the city 
as its company would, if given the 
chance.

“We asked for the financial 

information from the city but 
they wouldn’t give it to us,” Brent 
said. “We don’t know how much 
WeCare has repatriated back to the 
city based on the tipping and the 
sale. That would be an interesting 
thing to compare because their 
original RFP said they were going 
to give back $36,000 a year. I’d like 
to know if they did that.”

For Brent, the most infuriating 

part of the whole debacle surfaced 
when he found out whom WeCare 
had listed as references on its 
proposal submission. One of its 
references was Christina Gomes, 
the Ann Arbor solid waste and 
recycling coordinator. To Brent, 
this seemed like a clear conflict of 
interest.

“The thing that upset me 

the most was that Ms. Gomes 
was listed as a reference on the 
WeCare RFP,” Brent said. “She’s 
one of the three people to make 
the decision as to who’s going to 
get the contract.”

Neither Gomes nor the city 

of Ann Arbor responded to 
requests for comment, but city 
communications director Robert 
Keller forwarded a memo sent by 
the city to Brent and Hornstein 
when the pair asked why they had 
not received consideration for the 
contract. 

In 
the 
memo 
written 
by 

Craig Hupy, public services area 
administrator, the city denied all 
the allegations Cocoa Corporation 
had brought against WeCare.

In response to the claim 

that WeCare was violating its 
contract with the city, Hupy 
wrote that Cocoa Corporation had 
misunderstood the contract and 
that the actual document does not 
require any tonnage quantities of 
waste removal be met. The city 
also denied WeCare has created 

a potential landfill problem at the 
facility.

“Cocoa’s 
accusations 
and 

assertions are incorrect, and also 
show a lack of understanding of 
municipal compost operations,” 
the memo read.

The memo goes on to explain 

why it decided not to interview 
Cocoa Corporation after receiving 
its proposal submission.

“Cocoa’s priority was third 

party waste, which did not fit 
within the program goals the City 
was looking to accomplish with 
the RFP. … Furthermore, Cocoa 
presented 
extremely 
limited 

previous experience in compost 
management, 
its 
experience 

being only at a single facility that 
processes compostable materials 
in large part from a limited, and 
consisted category of sources… 
and only since 2015,” Hupy wrote.

There was no mention in the 

memo of the potential conflict of 
interest raised by Gomes being a 
reference of WeCare and a member 
of the selection committee.

Mike 
Nicholson, 
WeCare’s 

senior 
vice 
president 
and 

development manager, also said he 
did not want to comment directly 
on the allegations made against 
his company. However, he said he 
felt the company was following 
all the rules it were supposed to 
follow.

“At this point in time, we are 

in procurement with the city as 
our client, and we are following 
what we believe to be the rules 
of 
procurement,” 
Nicholson 

said. “We’re kind of keeping our 
comments to ourselves at this 
point in time.”

In Nicholson’s eyes, WeCare, 

which is a founding member of the 
Composting Council of Michigan, 
is doing a great job in Ann Arbor. 
He said the company feels it’s been 
quite successful in its six years 
working with the city. 

“We’ve been very successful,” 

Nicholson said. “We view the 
city as a partner, and we have 
provided leadership in the state. 
… We are now providing services 
for the University of Michigan, for 
their zero-waste program for all 
their athletic facilities. And most 
importantly, we helped the city 
implement their residential food 
waste recycling program.”

That occurred about three 

years after WeCare took over the 
compost contract, Nicholson said, 
and it’s the reason Ann Arbor 
residents and students like Sheedy 
can compost at their homes.

term effects.

“A subpopulation of the sample 

will be followed over time,” Veliz 
said. “So we’ll be able to see how 
are these diagnosed concussions 
influencing outcomes as these 
adolescents age into adulthood. So 
again, we’ll have two groups, those 
who were concussed versus those 
who weren’t, and we’ll be able to 
ask are there differences? Are they 
drastic?”

He also mentioned the role that 

sports play in this study.

“There 
are 
quite 
a 
few 

adolescents who participate in 
sports; I’m not saying that sports 
is the leading cause of concussion, 
but there is a strong association 
between participating in sports and 
having a head injury,” he explained. 
“We also have to understand that 75 
percent of children and adolescents 
participate in sports at a competitive 
level.”

Nursing 
sophomore 
Lucy 

Sandell, 
a 
member 
of 
the 

University’s Women’s Club Soccer, 
claimed this information didn’t 
come as a surprise to her.

“I 
definitely 
believe 
that; 

especially with sports,” Sandell 
said. “I’ve had three concussions 
throughout my life, all from playing 
soccer. Experiencing more than one 

can be very serious, my third caused 
migraines that lasted three weeks.”

The study was published in the 

Journal of the American Medical 
Association in Sept. 26, 2017.

LSA sophomore Will Olvera 

responded 
he 
also 
initially 

associated 
this 
statistic 
with 

sports, especially with the student 
body at the University.

“Upon first reaction, I’m not 

surprised,” he said. “I’m not really 
into sports in general, but I feel like 
no matter how much protection 
you use accidents happen. It’d be 
interesting to see how much more 
you’d see among certain sports 
like football or lacrosse ... but that 
number really doesn’t surprise 
me.”

the Fourth Street parking 
structure. He said the process 
was 
delayed 
in 
the 
past 

because of high costs and 
other construction in the area.

“Given 
today’s 
death, 

we’re 
moving 
forward 
to 

get the railings put in with 
those higher bid numbers,” 
Warpehoski 
said. 
“If 
we 

find out because of the other 
construction that it’s going to 
take a long time, we’ll go ahead 
and put lower-cost chain-

link fences or something else 
that can be deployed more 
quickly.”

Ann Arbor resident Peter 

Eckstein agreed placing a 
railing would help prevent 
suicide. 
He 
dispelled 
the 

common 
myth 
that 
“if 

someone is determined to 
kill themselves, they will, so 
putting up a fence will make 
them do it another way.”

“The statement defies itself,” 

Eckstein 
said. 
“‘If 
they’re 

determined!’ But often people 
aren’t determined in that same 
sense. It’s an impulse.”

Eckstein shared the story 

about his friend jumping from 

the Golden Gate Bridge in San 
Francisco after his girlfriend 
broke up with him. The bridge 
did not have railings back 
then.

“These things are often 

done on impulse, the gloomy 
moment. It’s dark out. The sun 
may come out in half an hour, 
in 10 minutes. By then you’re 
dead,” Eckstein said. “You 
may get a job, you may get a 
purpose, you may get another 
girlfriend or boyfriend. It’s not 
‘if you’re determined, you’re 
going to do it.’ And it is so easy 
to just climb up that wall and 
jump off. It’s scandalous that 
we let it happen.”

D

onald Trump wants to 
be your tour guide on 
what makes America 

great and how he is making it even 
greater and even more patriotic.

You can kick off your journey 

with a visit to Charlottesville, 
Va., a place with “some very 
fine 
people 
on 
both 
sides.” 

There, you’ll be treated to proud 
displays of Confederate flags and 
monuments — testament to the 
“patriotic and idealistic cause” 
known 
as 
the 
Confederacy, 

whose flag “proclaims a glorious 
heritage” — Trump’s friend at 
Breitbart helpfully explains.

Next, venture to Alabama to 

bask in the patriotism of newly 
elected 
Republican 
Senate 

candidate Judge Roy Moore. 
Who could be a more patriotic 
or devoted American than Judge 
Moore, who, like Mr. Trump, 
has questioned Barack Obama’s 
birthplace and would, if he could, 
have homosexuality outlawed?

If all this country-loving has 

worn you out, perhaps unwind 
at your nearest NASCAR track, 
a venue where, according to 
Mr. Trump, you would not find 
any disrespect for our country 
or our flag. Here you will find 
one of the few remaining places 
for patriots unsullied by lesser 
Americans where the crowd 
is reliable, united by race, 
orientation and creed.

After completing your tour 

of Mr. Trump’s America, do 
not despair if you still don’t 
grasp Mr. Trump’s brand of 
patriotism 
(dodging 
Vietnam, 

slavishly 
yielding 
to 
Russia, 

indiscriminately mocking those 
beyond 
his 
“base”). 
Maybe 

you don’t play to cameras by 
literally wrapping yourself in 
a flag, but unless you’ve truly 
gone out of your way to be mean 
and obnoxious to others, you’re 
almost certainly a truer patriot 
and a more devoted servant to 
American ideals than Mr. Trump.

That is because what Trump 

and his ilk celebrate is not 
real patriotism. It is selective 
patriotism 
— 
deference 
and 

respect are reserved only for 
individuals who hew to their 
narrow mindset. In The New 
Yorker last week, Prof. Jelani 
Cobb explained that Trump’s 
selective 
patriotism 
is 
what 

“drives him to curse at black 
football 
players 
but 
leaves 

him struggling to create false 
equivalence between Nazis and 
anti-Fascists in Charlottesville.”

Prof. Cobb exposes the lie of 

Trump’s patriotism. How can 
Trump glibly condemn Black 
football 
players 
who 
protest 

peacefully, 
yet 
struggle 
to 

condemn Nazis, attack Russia’s 
meddling in our elections, and 
acknowledge 
the 
Confederate 

monuments 
and 
flags? 
The 

mind does gymnastics trying 
to 
reconcile 
these 
obvious 

discrepancies as anything other 
than racism.

Of course, Trump cloaks his 

conduct and words in patriotism. 
But the founding fathers were 
wary of such exploitation of 
patriotism. 
In 
his 
farewell 

address to the nation in 1796, 
George 
Washington 
warned 

Americans to “guard against 
the impostures of pretended 
patriotism.” Alexander Hamilton 
expressed similar thoughts: “(I)n 
popular commotions especially, 

the clamours of interested and 
factious men are often mistaken 
for patriotism.”

Contrary to what Trump 

and his acolytes think, true 
devotion to the United States 
of America does not mean 
wrapping oneself in a flag and 
covering one’s eyes. Nor does 
it mean being self-righteous 
about one’s love for country.

Being a patriot in the United 

States means fighting to lift the 
most downtrodden of people. 
It means refusing to accept 
inequalities and injustices in 
society, even if doing so invites 
criticism. 
“True 
patriotism,” 

as the famed criminal lawyer 
Clarence 
Darrow 
once 
said, 

“hates injustice in its own land 
more than anywhere else.”

The country has had, and 

continues to have, many true 
patriots — those who advocated 
for women’s suffrage, traveled to 
Mississippi as Freedom Riders 
in an attempt to desegregate the 
South, marched in Washington 
with Martin Luther King Jr. in 
1963, marched in Washington 30 
years later to fight against LGBTQ 
discrimination and millions more 
who have enlisted in the military, 
voluntarily or otherwise.

Like the current movement 

by some professional athletes to 
take a knee during the playing 
of the national anthem, these 
historical acts of patriotism were 
also seen negatively at the time. 
As The Washington Post noted, 
most 
Americans 
viewed 
the 

Freedom Riders and the March 
on Washington unfavorably. A 
Newsweek survey found that only 
23 percent of Americans thought 
that the March on Washington 
for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal 
Rights and Liberation “did more 
good than harm in the fight for 
gay rights.”

Today, however, few, other 

than self-proclaimed “patriots” 
like the Charlottesville Tiki torch 
bearers and Judge Moore, would 
deny that the advances gained 
by the suffragettes, the Freedom 
Riders, civil rights activists and 
others who marched to promote 
the welfare of all Americans, 
greatly improved this nation, its 
social fabric and the lives of tens 
of millions.

Protest has lifted the most 

marginalized 
in 
our 
nation. 

Protest has jolted the United 
States out of systemic injustices 
that run counter to the values 
enshrined by the Constitution. 
When we consider the progress 
that we have made in our 241-year 
history, we look to the individuals 
who have had the courage to 
believe that this nation can and 
must do better.

Those kneeling in protest hold 

that same belief. Colin Kaepernick 
took a knee not to object to the flag 
or the anthem, but to object to the 
selective application of the justice 
system in the United States. In 
Slate, John Legend called the 
protests “an attempt to educate 
the public that criminal justice 
— mass incarceration, lengthy 
sentences, police brutality — is 
the civil rights issues of our time.”

Kneeling, 
a 
silent 
and 

nonviolent protest, aims simply to 
call attention to the grave failures 
of our institutions, especially 
toward 
Black 
Americans. 

These athletes simply seek to 
highlight how pervasive these 
racial disparities are, however 
uncomfortable this might make 
some of us. They challenge 
President Trump, our political 
leaders and all of us to not be blind 
nationalists but true patriots, 
loyal to our most cherished ideals 
of fair, honest, equal treatment 
and opportunity for all.

F

rom the moment I entered 
the Michigan League to 
attend 
Tuesday’s 
panel 

discussion on the renaming of 
the C.C. Little Building, I sensed 
the evening’s event would be a 
contentious one. Little, former 
president of both the University 
of Michigan and the American 
Eugenics Society, has been subject 
to increasingly heated debate — 
due in large part to his involvement 
in the eugenics movement.

As I walked to the event, I 

found myself in the midst of 
protesters also headed there. I 
heard one protester responding 
to their friend’s comment about 
the discussion they were about 
to attend: “What discussion? It’s 
racist to have a discussion.”

The frustrations of the students 

of color and their allies at the event 
are entirely justified due to the 
University’s inaction regarding 
concerns over buildings named 
after racists and the broader 
struggles minority students face 
in their battle against racism and 
other forms of bigotry on campus. 
But snubbing the exchange of ideas 
is not the way to further a cause.

Members 
of 
the 
panel, 

Professors Alexandra Stern and 
Martin Pernick and LSA senior 
Joshua Hasler, were consistently 
unable to speak, due to protesters 
interjections — angry over the lack 
of progress in the name change 
process and insistent that the 
academics in front of them weren’t 
doing enough, or even that they 
were part of the problem.

As I stood and watched the 

events unfold, I found myself torn 
between the grievances of the 
protesters and the educational, 
though not politically detached, 
position of those on the panel. 
Reconciling the division between 
radical activists and the academics 
who can give them the tools to 
engage in critical and historically 
informed ways with their activism 
is a major challenge in current 

university student movements.

The categorical dismissal of 

information proffered by educators 
and the rejection of discussion 
creates an environment hostile 
to learning and understanding. 
While I agree wholeheartedly 
with efforts to change the name 
of the C.C. Little Building — and 
all other buildings which threaten 
to normalize and valorize the 
University’s 
bigoted 
past 
— 

rebuffing information and debate 
does no service to accomplish 
these ends. Regardless of a person’s 
certainty in their point of view, 
it’s crucial that they listen when 
information is offered in order to 
maintain an informed opinion.

Furthermore, I doubt anyone in 

the room would dispute C.C. Little’s 
racism; the purpose of the event 
wasn’t to debate whether his views 
were justified. But consensus on 
that point shouldn’t mean the end 
of discussion. While formal efforts 
to change the name have already 
been made, continuing to learn 
about Little and other problematic 
figures in the University’s past (and 
present) is crucial to provide an 
evidential basis for the removal of 
such names.

Perhaps the greatest frustration 

I observed at this event is one often 
directed at historians, who are 
tasked with having “the answers.” 
While history may not provide us 
with straightforward solutions, 
a knowledge of history will show 
a reasonable adversary that you 
care enough to have educated 
yourself on the nuances of your 
cause and will bolster the gravity 
of your appeal. In an institution 
steeped in tradition, acquiring 
historical knowledge will show 
administrators that you recognize 
the significance of names. It can 
also help you come to a solution 
that stops validating proven racists, 
while not devolving into erasure 
and whitewashing.

There’s 
also 
an 
important 

distinction 
to 
be 
made 

between 
commemoration 
and 

remembrance. The debate isn’t 
about whether to remember C.C. 
Little. It’s about whether his name 
should be emblazoned on a science 
building as a sign of honor, or 
whether his memory would be of 
better use in a museum that can 
educate future generations on the 
University’s past failings and the 
power of students in creating new 
histories.

I am also quite concerned 

that students fail to understand 
the 
implications 
of 
spurning 

the offer of information from 
University professors and the 
dangers of rejecting debate. While 
I understand the critique that the 
panel was all white — which is 
something that should be remedied 
in future discussions — the fact 
that professors are willing to 
discuss this topic is an educational 
opportunity that shouldn’t be 
taken for granted.

Listening to a person speak 

does not mean you have to agree 
with them. But shouting down 
educators (especially when they 
are, in fact, supporters of your 
cause) only creates rifts, instead 
of fostering a fruitful learning 
environment that can serve as a 
springboard for activism.

Fundamental to a university 

setting, as well as a democracy 
in general, is that people feel safe 
to discuss ideas and to practice 
critical thinking. The individuals 
participating in the protest, as 
well as those on the panel, are 
playing an important role in 
rectifying a wrong in the history 
of the University. If protesters 
would allow themselves to be 
historically informed, their case 
to remove Little’s name and 
their continued, valiant struggle 
against the ennoblement of the 
University’s bigoted past would be 
all the more powerful.

I

’m studying abroad in 
Paris 
this 
semester, 

something I’ve dreamed 

of doing forever. And I’ve been 
here for a few weeks already — 
time is flying!

I feel really lonely; I miss 

home and Ann Arbor and school 
and familiarity. And that’s not 
something I expected. Going 
abroad, in my mind, didn’t 
include any of the difficult stuff. 
I think I have this image of 
myself as a self-sufficient person, 
a lifelong New Yorker whom 
friends describe as charismatic 
and surprisingly outgoing, a boy 
who only needs a backpack filled 
with a book, journal and maybe a 
bottle of water to be good to go.

But since I’ve arrived, I’ve 

begun to learn how to appreciate 
my most intimate friendships, 
even as the friends themselves 
are thousands of miles away.

I often walk around this 

beautiful place wondering why 
I’m here, what image of myself 
I’m trying to cultivate and for 
whom. Why I’ve intentionally 
surrounded myself with people 
I don’t know, in a new place, 
where people speak a language 
that I have to think quite hard 
about before saying anything 
of substance. I’ve thought a lot 
about how people here read me, 
about the personality I have. 
Quiet 
and 
unassuming, 
I’d 

imagine. I’ve never been called 
these things before. I become, 
then, a stranger even to myself.

Both 
on 
internal 
and 

intersocial 
levels, 
I 
become 

intra-alienated. How I regard 
my circumstances is skewed by 
my present nostalgia for home, 
and, in trying to speak to people 
here, I am read in a specifically 
alienating way, as well.

I really want to be with my 

best friends in the places I know 
best. I’m a senior, so time in Ann 
Arbor, a place where it feels as if 
I’ve lived about seven individual 
lives filled with friendships 
and follies and discoveries and 
observant strolls through the 
crannies of my mind, is coming 
to an end. I check my Snapchat 
on Saturdays to get a glimpse of 
the tailgates I’ve experienced for 
the past three years.

And when I get caught up 

in all that I’m missing out on, 
in all that’s not here, I very 
quickly sink into myself, such 

that everything here, all of the 
beauty and excitement of being 
here, the budding friendships 
with other students here — all 
of it dissipates, becomes an 
afterthought. None of it holds 
weight anymore. I feel confused 
by this sudden change in emotion 
and outlook and I ask myself: 
If only I were home, why do I 
do this, why do I stray from the 
familiar just for the sake of it? 
Why do I do this, when staying 
home would be so much easier?

With these thoughts going 

through me, I neglect to explore 
the city, instead staying in my 
apartment 
and 
FaceTiming 

friends 
from 
home. 
Which 

makes me feel guilty, as if I’m 
doing this wrong, as if I’m not 
taking advantage of being here, 
as I should be. Shame gets 
mixed into the equation, as 
well. I immediately begin to feel 
starkly, existentially terrible, in 
a way that isn’t sustainable. My 
loneliness here is something I 
need to figure out.

Before coming here, I didn’t 

think about the impact a place 
can have on how I feel within 
myself. How the ability to 
identify with a certain place — 
like I do with Ann Arbor or with 
New York City, where I grew up 
— allows me to feel enlivened, 
and how not being able to identify 
with a place, as I have felt here, 
can make me feel stultified and, 
at worst, unhinged.

Being lonely and grappling 

with all this newness have 
specific effects on my psyche. 
My past experiences become dim 
and distant while my present 
sorrow becomes everything I 
know. All that I love feels so 
far away, and all that I do not 
have here, all the absence I feel 
without my best friends and my 
family, takes over.

Stepping back and arriving in 

a place where I can consider and 
comment upon these instances 
of bad feeling, through self-
reflection and conversation with 
loved ones, I’ve learned a couple 
important lessons. First, there’s 
not one right way to do this, to 
be here. I’m not here to see the 
sights of Paris necessarily. I’m 
here to live, to exist in a new 
place. Whatever that means for 
me — staying indoors, walking 
all day, feeling lousy, feeling 
fantastic — whatever life brings.

Because this is still life, even 

though I’m away. And living is 
complex, regardless of where 
one is. New baggage will always 
form, regrets will take shape, 
grass will always appear greener 
somewhere else.

And 
through 
those 

conversations with others, I 
remember the love I have in 
my life, both with other people 
and with other places. My dad, 
with whom email has always 
been the predominant form of 
communication, articulated this 
lesson particularly beautifully:

“What and who are physically 

present is different/maybe less 
than all that is only psychically 
present. But whatever is present 
(coupled with what is only 
available in your mind, via 
memory 
and 
anticipation 
— 

we’ve been with you and we will 
soon again be with you — all of 
us — is what you have — that 
combination of psychically and 
materially present stuff (people 
and things). It’s what you have, 
that combination. It’s what I have 
too — that combination. I have 
you here (the imagined Isaiah, 
reading this; the imagined Isaiah 
with whom I am currently in 
psychic connection by writing 
this) and the Isaiah I eagerly 
anticipate seeing soon; and all 
the recollections of 21 years of 
beloved Isaiah.”

We all feel loneliness. And 

maybe one way of measuring 
the strength of friendships is by 
testing that psychic connection, 
by measuring how well you can 
feel somebody with you even if 
they are thousands of miles away. 
Which, in turn, warms my heart. 
Because of how strongly I feel so 
many of my friends and family 
are here with me right now.

In that sense, by spending 

time away, my friendships are 
increasing in strength and clarity. 
I ought not to think of the absence 
of my friends and family as that, 
as an absence. But, instead, I 
ought to think of all those people 
as being here, to think of their 
presence, to reflect on all that 
we have shared and, crucially, 
to think of all the moments — 
psychic and material — to come.

ALBUM REVIEW

Gone are the days of Miley 

Cyrus pole dancing in front 
of thousands of screaming 
pre-teens, or smoking salvia 
from 
a 
large 

bong at a house 
party. Miley has, 
apparently, 
had 

her near decade of 
experimentation 
and found herself 
again, essentially 
right back where 
she 
started, 

living in a happy 
rainbow land.

Younger 
Now, 

her latest, is a 
country pop album that lacks 
clear chronology. To call it 
timeless would be a mistake, 
as that indicates a more lasting 
appeal, but Miley does float in 
some odd, newfound balance 
between 
past 
and 
present 

on this project. If she hadn’t 
been pulled through the TMZ 
ringer back in 2009 for her 
very typical teenage behavior, 
this could easily have been her 
third album — not her sixth.

That the road back to her 

roots has been so long does 
come 
with 
rewards. 
The 

sappy, sometimes plain, never 
too 
deep 
songwriting 
has 

an earned quality to it, now 
considering her past tumult. On 
lead single “Malibu,” she sings, 
“I never would’ve believed you 
if three years ago you told me 
/ I’d be here writing this song” 
and she sounds genuine, with 
distant pain in her voice. It’s 
hard to deny the sweetness of 
this sentiment. Unless you’re 
a tabloid writer or a Twitter 
stan, we don’t generally wish 
for the emotional downfall of a 
distant pop star we don’t know. 
There’s a lot of real joy in 
hearing that she’s happy with 
who she is now. 

The problem, though, is that 

there is a piece missing on this 
timeline, and it is hard to accept 
that we’ve arrived at this 
cute, content and inoffensive 
country pop album without 

practically any reference to 
the era from Can’t Be Tamed 
to Miley Cyrus and Her Dead 
Petz. In many ways, that era of 
Miley is the one which we’re 
most familiar with now, and 
this pivot will strike many as 
confusing, 
especially 
since 

it goes largely unprocessed 

on this release. 
There 
are 
no 

serious cathartic 
tracks 
about 

her 
past, 
no 

explanations for 
her 
behavior. 

Instead, 
we’re 

meant to simply 
accept that this 
is, yet again, the 
new Miley.

It’s 
this 

missing 
piece 

that makes Younger Now, while 
occasionally enjoyable, largely 
a disappointment. When the 
feverish background vocals on 
“Malibu” really come through 
on the second chorus, you 
want to grab that Miley by the 
shoulders, pull her out from 
behind the curtain and beg her 
to scream louder. It’s like she’s 
hiding behind a well-groomed 
version of herself who needs 
you to know that she’s fine, 
and what that strangles is the 
satisfaction some prior tracks 
had, like “Wrecking Ball” and 
“Lighter.”

There are a few moments of 

fun here. The title track can 
be played a few times over and 
still be enjoyed, and “Inspired” 
is 
nice 
enough, 
almost 

actually inspiring. There’s an 
endearing Dolly Parton feature 
that’s mostly notable for the 
voicemail from Parton, where 
she talks about recording on 
a cassette and using a flip 
phone. The rest tends to bleed 
together.

Which 
brings 
me 
to 

another Friday release that 
also suffers from a bit of 
blandness. Four Tet’s newest 
album, 
New 
Energy, 
is 
a 

not nearly the whiplash of 
Miley Cyrus’s genre switch, 
but 
it 
does 
include 
some 

boundary pushing beyond his 
discography, as Kieran Hebden 
is want to do.

He keeps to his trademark 

here, mixing very natural, 
life-like sounds on top of a 
subtle club beat that is always 
controlled and never explodes. 
He uses an Eastern-inspired 
harp noise on this release, 
and it remains a constant 
throughout, 
applied 
most 

intriguingly on “Lush” and 
“Two Thousand Seventeen.” 
The former bounces back and 
forth in simple trance, while 
the latter moves languidly 
between the Eastern harp and 
soft, moody synths. Hebden has 
a skill for changing the scene 
up just when you thought the 
sound would get redundant. It’s 
what made Rounds and There 
Is Love In You so powerful and 
interesting.

He employs that on this 

release too, but lets some of the 
duller moments go on for longer 
than they should. “Daughter” 
sags at the start, as does “You 
Are Loved,” and though the 
payoffs are praiseworthy, the 
build-up can be exhausting.

He would have done well 

taking a few more cues from 
his impressive remixes, like his 
recent of The xx’s “A Violent 
Noise.” 
He’s 
particularly 

successful when he draws you 
in just far enough, hinting at 
a climax that never exactly 
comes. 
That 
might 
sound 

frustrating, but by the end 
you’re itching to start the song 
over to experience that journey 
again. Four Tet’s project above 
all is about the process, so 
it’s not surprising that there 
are slower moments on his 
releases. When it works, you’re 
left with an infectious inner 
rhythm that suggests a dance, 
but one in solely in your head. 
This is achieved on the album’s 
single, 
“Scientists,” 
which 

combines voice, drum patterns 
and the organic harp in a 
growing chorus that almost 
reaches a Gregorian chant at 
its peak.

So as with most Four Tet 

albums, New Energy can be 
overlong and taxing, but it 
manages, at points, to continue 
the project that Hebden has 
been working on for nearly two 
decades.

Form follows function in 
indie-romance ‘Columbus’

SUNDANCE

FILM REVIEW

At the center of “Columbus” is 

a bank designed by Eero Saarinen. 
It’s the first truly modernist 
bank, 
a 
simple 
unimposing 

glass building. Built in a time 
— Casey (Haley 
Lu 
Richardson 

“Split”) tells us — 
when banks were 
fortresses where 
tellers sat behind 
bars.

Then 
Saarinen 
came 
to 

Columbus and rewrote the rules 
for what a bank, and really what 
a building, should be. “Columbus” 
takes it’s name from the same 
sleepy Indiana town that boasts 
Mike 
Pence’s 
birthplace 
and 

a concentration of modernist 
architecture. And like Saarinen’s 
bank, the film breaks from the 
conventions of modern indie films 
— simplifies, elevates and opens 
them up.

After his estranged arcitect 

father ends up in the hospital 
during a business trip, Jin (John 
Cho “Star Trek Beyond”), a 
translator living in Seoul, travels 
to Columbus. He meets Casey, 
who shares his father’s love of 
architecture, and lets her take 
him around the city showing him 
the buildings she loves. The result 
is a lot like a Linklater film — 
quiet and simple with meticulous 
visual composition. It’s a walk and 

talk movie where the characters 
just happen to be talking about 
modernist architecture.

A stunning debut feature from 

Kogonada, “Columbus” owes a 
great deal of it’s staying power 
to it’s cinematographer Elisha 
Christian (“In Your Eyes”) who 
composes shots with precision 
and nuance. The camera lingers in 

quiet long takes that 
are balanced and 
beautiful. Buildings 
and 
nature 
are 

given equal screen 
time and we are 

asked to look at both through the 
admiring eyes of the two leads. 
Through their eyes — and through 
Christian’s — banks and hospitals 
become things of immense beauty. 
Most movies have at least one 
shot that floors me. “Columbus” 
is a movie made entirely of those 
kinds of shots.

Richardson 
and 
Cho’s 

chemistry isn’t initially apparent. 
Their first interaction — smoking 
cigarettes on either side of a fence 
— is odd. They make bad jokes and 
have to explain them, but both 
actors have the subtlety to infuse 
their slow, and often awkward, 
courtship with charm.

Richardson especially proves 

herself to be at the top of her 
class. She is an absolute dream as 
Casey, giving the kind of nuanced 
and 
vulnerable 
performances 

most actors only find in their late 
careers. 

“Columbus” is a romance and 

yet it’s not entirely clear who is 

falling in love with whom. There’s 
the obvious couple, Jin and Casey, 
but there’s also Jin’s unresolved 
feelings for Eleanor and Casey’s 
flirtation with Gabriel. Ultimately 
it seems the real love story, the 
most compelling romance, is that 

between people and buildings.

It’s a romance in the sense 

that it’s a movie about love and 
the ways in which people share 
what they love. It’s a movie about 
a girl who loves a bank and tries 
to tell a man why she loves it. But, 
of course, it’s impossible to put 
something like that into words.

“Columbus” is as unexpected 

as it’s namesake. A secret stash of 
beauty in a genre — quiet indies 
— that often prioritize quirk 
and cleverness over aesthetic 
composition. Like the buildings it 
depicts, “Columbus” cares equally 
about form and function.

ALBUM REVIEW
Young Thug harkens to 
his classic sound on latest

By 
the 
time 
I 
started 

writing this review, Young 
Thug had just been arrested 
for possession of marijuana 
and 
tinted 
windows. 
This 

development is unfortunate 
but also equally Young Thug, 
not in terms of illegality, 
but 
in 
nonconformity 
to 

societal strictures. Strictures, 
including within his music — 
bars, some form of rhythm, 
the 
essentials 
— 
aren’t 

something 
with 
which 
he 

concerns 
himself. 
In 
this 

sense, the rapper is different, 
not “normal”; we know this. 
He knows we know this, but 
he says things like “Everybody 
got tigers / So I’m gon’ go get 
a liger” so we know he knows 
that we know this. If you 
create your own canon of rap 
experimentalism, as he has, 
this is just something you do.

If 
you’re 
Thug, 
most 

recently, you make a ballad-
heavy 
album 
(Beautiful 

Thugger Girls) with the most 
croony guitar the genre has 
seen since Jay-Z ironically 
brought one out to mock Noel 
Gallagher at Glastonbury in 
2008.

While the guitar gets left 

behind 
on 
Young 
Martha, 

Thug’s latest — a collaboration 
with Carnage — stays weird, 
because it’s just something 
Thug does. This form of weird 
begins with the grandiose on 
“Homie”; Meek Mill trades 
punches between passionate 
Thug hooks (“I got a bottle of 
Ace and I popped it and I don’t 
even pour it up”) that reinforce 
the type of energy we’ve come 
to expect from him.

This EP is more Jeffery — 

a trap landmark thanks to 
its defiance of convention — 
than Beautiful Thugger Girls, 
employing more traditionally 
thumping 
production 
and 

leaving out the more tender 
exclamations we heard from 
Thug on the latter.

“Liger,” 
for 
example, 
is 

confidently Thug, as he shows 
quirkiness 
and 
pomposity, 

the closest thing to normal 
being Carnage’s synth cuts. 
The track feels primed for a 
mainstream splash.

That a rapper can make 

such a splash after making 
strong 
statements 
ranging 

from the political to the, 
well, 
inescapably 
political, 

is an impressive reflection 
of his influence within the 
industry. And, while his status 
as a catalyst for previously 
ambiguous rap territory has 

been given a ton of attention 
at this point, it doesn’t make 
his quintessential self any less 
entertaining.

“10,000 
Slimes” 
sees 

Young Thug at this most 
quintessential self, with quips 
(“her booty ja-jiggly, wiggly”) 
that we would never hear 
from Drake, or J. Cole, or 
anyone of that vanilla variety, 
and it makes it all the more 
fun. 
The 
highlight 
might 

be “Don’t Call Me,” which 
features multi-instrumentalist 
production 
infused 
with 

an 
explicit 
pop 
sensibility 

before 
unheard 
from 
the 

rapper. Here Carnage’s touch 
shines, allowing enough room 
for a chopped Shakka hook 
that pulls the song together 
as 
something 
definitively 

un-Thug. In his world of 
undefined 
boundaries, 
we 

welcome the dancehall.

Young Martha isn’t really 

“new,” but if that sounds 
disappointing, it shouldn’t. If 
it’s not a marked progression 
in his development, it is, at the 
very least, a fun diversion, four 
tracks that layer effectively 
but still masquerade as cogs in 
this typical Thug fun machine. 
Enjoy Young Martha for now 
— he’ll probably “twist it like 
a tootsie roll,” or something of 
that sort, again, very soon.

Children, listen: The best 

thing to read on the internet 
is New York magazine’s Grub 
Street Diet. Once a week, the 
site publishes someone’s food 
journal of the past few days — a 
culinary diary from people who 
range from minimally famous 
to Kristen Bell.

Of course, the great secret 

of the Grub Street Diet is that, 
often, it’s the random author 
you’ve never heard of or the 
CEO of a company you didn’t 
know 
existed 
that 
writes 

the best piece (spoiler alert, 
Kristen 
Bell’s 
diet 
sounds 

atrocious). The best of these 
diary entries read like the 
world’s best food writing from 
people who aren’t even food 
writers; they’re ridiculously 
entertaining vignettes of a 
few days eating around New 
York, San Francisco or LA. 
The worst Grub Street Diets 
are unfortunately bland, rote 
descriptions 
of 
food. 
And 

sometimes you find one that 
is, truly, impossible to explain 
— a great sentence to take out 
of context here is this: “I have 
a lot of calls to do this morning, 
so I pour a cold sugar-free Red 
Bull into a hot large coffee and 
gulp it.”

Obviously now, in honor of 

my favorite weekly content 
machine, I’ll try my best to 
recreate a Grub Street Diet for 
a couple of uneventful days. 
Let’s all be mindful that I’m 
in college, I was on the tail 
end of my grocery supply and I 
simply did not have the time to 
cook that much. I apologize in 
advance. (And now that I think 
about it, I take back what I said 
about New York Giants running 
back Rashad Jennings writing 
a shitty blog post. I’m sorry, 
Rashad. Much like playing 
with Eli Manning as your 
quarterback, this was harder 
than it looks.)

Monday, September 25
Keeping with the theme of 

“harder than it looks,” I wake 
up at 7:20, 10 minutes before 
my alarm is supposed to go off 
at 7:30. I hate that.

That’s a fitting omen: It’s 

going to be a horrible week! I 
have — and I believe this is the 
metric unit used around the 
world — a shit-ton of work, all 
due before Thursday and with 
no time to do it. But I must 
eat, of course, so after a solid 
shower, I head down to the 
kitchen and make some coffee. 
I look around for something, 
anything, before I find some 
honey. There’s yogurt in the 
fridge, so I slap some into a 
bowl and drizzle a bit of cheap, 
Trader Joe’s honey on top. The 
coffee tastes like ass. It’s fine. 
This is good enough.

Hungry and tired, several 

hours and a lot of hard work 

later I realize I need to head 
home to make myself a grilled 
cheese. I’d like to say here 
that, if nothing else, my grilled 
cheeses are fantastic. Even if 
I don’t have the ideal bread 
(pullman loaf, of course), I 
still always manage to put 
together 
a 
solid 
sandwich. 

It takes a slightly unhealthy 
amount of butter, that plastic 
Kraft American Singles stuff 
and, as I’ve learned, patience. 
I down a quick one made with 

multigrain bread, sliced into 
triangles, and then I’m off to 
the Espresso Royale.

Everyone calm down. Of 

course it’s the one on State 
Street; I don’t hate myself.

Despite a good 20 minutes 

of actual work and two hours 
of, well, not that, I feel in need 
of a treat. I pick up a small 
coffee and a blueberry muffin. 
Espresso’s baked goods aren’t 
the greatest, but they get the 
job done. And they fill you up!

Alas, dinner that night is 

a special one. I’m working 
production at the University’s 
most editorially and financially 
independent newspaper, so we 
all decide TK Wu is the way 
to go. TK Wu, on E. Liberty, is 
a staple of the last few years 
I’ve been at the Daily. There’s 
nowhere 
else 
on 
campus 

you can get such good shitty 
Chinese food, and at such an 
affordable price! And if you’re 
going to go bad Chinese food, 
you might as well go full bad 
Chinese food: I order the 
General Tso’s Chicken with 
white rice. It’s incredible for 
the first few bites, and then 
once you realize all that murky, 
red liquid at the bottom of the 
container may not, in fact, be 
actual food, you throw it out. 
It’s glorious. I’m only slightly 
embarrassed.

Tuesday, September 26
Mondays suck, of course, but 

Tuesdays are a great day of the 
week for me. I don’t have class 
until four, but again, since this 
is a week of endless papers and 
math assignments, I get up 
early in the hopes of getting it 
all done. I make another cup of 
really bad coffee (guys, don’t 
worry, it’s just that my coffee 

machine sucks), and then head 
to the gym. I make it back an 
hour later, shower, throw on a 
dope outfit, eat a banana and 
step outside. It’s still hot as 
nuts.

Nevertheless, I make my 

way over to my temple (the 
Espresso on State Street), and, 
sweaty and flustered, I order 
another coffee. I hammer out 
a couple essays of dubious 
quality. Bruegger’s, which is 
apparently the only place in 
Ann Arbor you can get a bagel, 
is across the street; I blurt out 
the classic line — “Can you 
watch my stuff real quick?” — 
to no one in particular and trot 
over.

My 
take 
on 
Bruegger’s 

fluctuates. It’s obviously not 
the 
greatest 
restaurant 
on 

the planet (you’ll notice I’ve 
lowered my standards for a 
lot of things this week), but 
they do serve smoked salmon. 
I order the sandwich with lox, 
cream cheese, tomatoes, red 
onions and capers. It’s good, 
and just filling enough.

Ethically, it wouldn’t be 

right if I didn’t cook at least 
one meal for this goddamn faux 
Grub Street diet. I’ve realized 
now that, again, I am in no 
place to criticize New York 
Giants running back Rashad 
Jennings for the quality of his 
internet writing. But I will say 
this: This is a pretty boring 
diary so far, to be sure, but I’m 
a college student in Ann Arbor 
with a limited budget. If you’re 
an East Coast media elite-type 
in New York City, you have no 
excuses. Buy that $4 fucking 
coffee and tell us how it tastes, 
man.

As for my own meal: Today’s 

dinner 
will 
be... 
chicken 

breasts! Ah, chicken breasts, 
that famous dish we all know 
and love. I’ve marinated them 
in a quick solution of olive oil, 
garlic powder, onion powder, 
chilli powder, salt, pepper and 
then whatever else I could 
find in the spice cabinet. They 
all taste the same. Except for 
cinnamon. They do not all taste 
like cinnamon.

The first thing I do is get a 

good sear on these bad boys, 
because that’s crucial. Don’t 
let anyone tell you otherwise. I 
pop them in the oven to finish 
off, because you’ve got to cook 
the meat, of course. Don’t let 
anyone tell you otherwise. I 
microwave a bag of that Trader 
Joe’s frozen brown rice stuff, 
because that’s what I had time 
for. Don’t let anyone tell you 
otherwise. After a quick sautee 
of broccoli and mushrooms, I 
carefully compose a plate of 
one piece of chicken, a handful 
of rice and some vegetables. 
Nice! This is a good enough 
image to end on.

COURTESY OF MANHATTAN SHORT FILM FESTIVAL

FESTIVAL REVIEW

For one week every year, 

film lovers gather in over 
250 cities across the globe 
to simultaneously watch and 
vote on the ten 
short 
films 
of 

the 
Manhattan 

Short 
Film 

Festival. 
Highly 

competitive, 
prestigious 
and 

interactive, 
Manhattan Short 
Films seeks to showcase talent 
from around the world and 
enable viewers to determine 
the merit of each screened 
piece. This year, the 10 selected 
films exhibited diversity in 
both genre and nationality, 
with compelling stories and 
performances condensed in 15 
minutes or less.

Selected from over 1,600 

submissions, it is clear why 
this year’s ten short films 
made the cut. Though more 
or less predictable, every film 
was clean cut, entertaining 
and well-paced. The strongest 

films highlighted unique and 
influential figures in history, 
such as the Auschwitz prisoner 
who cut the hair of a Nazi 
general for four years in tense 
silence (“Hope Dies Last”), and 
the Italian woman who defied 
the law that forced women to 
marry their rapists (“Viola 

Franca”). 
The 

most complex and 
disturbing 
film, 

“Mare Nostrum,” 
worked to dignify 
Syrian 
refugees 

and 
complicate 

the act of risking 
one’s 
life 
in 

the name of hope. The only 
animated piece, “In A Nutshell,” 
was a visually stunning stream 
of consciousness that linked 
unlikely 
objects 
together. 

The festival ended with “8 
Minutes,” a moving piece set in 
an apocalypse that strengthens 
the bond between a magician 
and his son. 

Overall, the festival was a 

fun and entertaining showcase 
of diverse international talent. 
The 
viewing 
and 
voting 

process is unique in its way 
of connecting the viewer to a 
global community of people 

watching and voting on the 
same pieces at the same time. 
I really enjoyed the experience 

and recommend it to anyone 
who 
enjoys 
succinct 
and 

compelling film.

FILM REVIEW
‘I Am Blues’ gives lost 
legends moment to shine

Before there was rock ‘n’ roll 

or country or hip hop, there 
were the blues. 
Blues, the father 
of 
soul, 
were 

born in the deep 
south, nursed in 
the 
swamplands 

of Louisiana with 
a 
broken 
piano 

and cradled along 
the Mississippi River with a 
horsehair guitar. From the 
smokehouses to the BBQ joints 
to the churches to the cotton 
fields, there was once a time 
when blues were everywhere. 
Documentarian Daniel Cross 
(“Chairman 
George”) 
goes 

back to the birthplace of blues 
to take the audience on a tour 
of the once-glittering world 
of B.B. King and Jimmy Reed, 
now a wasteland of neglect 
fueled only by the few, devoted 

players dedicated 
to 
keeping 
the 

blues alive.

Through 

interviews 
and 

impromptu 
jam 

sessions 
with 

blues 
masters 

and key players, 

now in their late 80s, “I Am The 
Blues” illustrates the passion, 
artistry and history behind 
the art that lives on. The film 
is grounded in the present, by 
following blues legends like 
Bobby Rush, Barbara Lynn, 
Lazy Lester, Little Freddie 

King, Henry Gray and more, 
while expertly painting a vivid 
picture of the lively past of the 
genre solely through stories and 

first-hand accounts (the only 
archival footage is shown in 
the credits). Despite their age, 
these legends still have their 
rhythm, but most importantly, 
they still have their blues.

Tuesday, October 3, 2017 — 7

So 
far 
this 
season, 
the 

Michigan women’s soccer team 
has had a consistent story — 
the Wolverines (2-1-3 Big Ten, 
5-2-6 overall) have utilized a 
talented crop of freshmen to fill 
in the gaps left by a multitude 
of injuries. Michigan’s battle 
against Nebraska (1-1-2, 7-3-2) 
on Sunday was consistent with 
this narrative, with one notable 
exception.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Ani 

Sarkisian returned.

Sarkisian was the only senior 

starter, and one of just three 
seniors to earn minutes in the 
drag out 110-minute, 1-1 tie.

“It feels like I’ve been out for 

a year, but it’s been like a week 
and a half,” Sarkisian said.

After a three-game absence 

due to injury, Sarkisian resumed 
her spot back on the field, but 
not in her usual position. The 
experienced co-captain had to 
make up for other Wolverine 
losses on defense in the first 
half, before she was moved to a 
more familiar midfield position 
to start the second.

“I 
put 
(Sarkisian) 
at 

centerback,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Greg Ryan. “She’s played 
about 10 minutes of centerback 
before today. We were just 
trying to find answers.”

But just two minutes into 

the second half, after getting 
the wind knocked out of her, 
Sarkisian stayed down for an 
extended period of time. The 
game clock paused before she 
slowly reached her feet. She 
jogged off the blow, but just a 
few minutes later, Sarkisian 
drew a yellow card. Once 
again, she looked slow to get 
up. This time, her teammates 
capitalized on the free kick, 
and redshirt junior forward 
Taylor Timko found the back of 
the net.

Michigan would not score 

again.

“More 
than 
anything 

(having Sarkisian back) gives 
us a leader on the field,” Ryan 
said. “I think Ani’s presence 
was clearly felt by everybody 
in the game. If she got the 
ball she was calm with it, she 
connected us.”

While 
the 
Wolverines 

had scoring difficulties, the 
Cornhuskers were also unable 
to break the draw, but not for 
lack of shooting. Nebraska 
ended the double overtime 
game with 25 shots, six of 
which were saved by freshman 
goalkeeper 
Hillary 
Beall. 

Michigan had just nine shots 
all match.

With the shaken up defensive 

line missing key components 
in sophomore Brooke Cilley 
and freshman Alia Martin, 
Beall needed to perform at her 
peak. In the last seconds of the 
second overtime, Beall was 
forced to jump on a live ball in 
the middle of a scrum. She held 
on, solidifying the Wolverines’ 
sixth tie of the season.

“I 
have 
tremendous 

confidence in Hillary,” Ryan 
said. “This was a big game for 
her, to play against another 
real quality opponent and to do 
well. We’ve had her in some big 
games. We had her against No.1 
South Carolina; she played 90 
minutes in that game.”

Beall is one of six freshmen 

that earned a starting nod for 
Michigan. The injuries have 
caused players, like Sarkisian, 
to learn new roles quickly — 
and surprise their coach with 
their success.

“We 
had 
two 
freshmen 

playing wingback for us today,” 
Ryan 
said. 
“Sam 
DeVecchi 

hasn’t been out there — I don’t 
think she’s ever played there in 
her life — and I thought they 
both did really well. That’s 
been a big bright spot for us. 

These freshmen like (Faith 
Harper) and (DeVecchi) who 
we’ve been able to put into 
different spots and they do 
really well anytime we put 
them anywhere.”

While the Wolverines have 

been able to grind out even 
matches with a shuffled roster, 
they have not been able to push 
into winning territory. The 
shorter bench is an obvious 
obstacle that Michigan may 
soon be relieved of.

“I think we’re going to have 

at least two more (players) back 
next weekend,” Sarkisian said. 
“It will be nice to have fresh 
legs out there and have people 
sub in and out. We weren’t 
really able to do that much this 
weekend since we didn’t have 
as much depth.”

With freshmen proving their 

abilities and starters returning 
to the lineup, the Wolverines 
may soon regain their missing 
edge. 

It was a low, cannon of a shot off 

the laces of redshirt junior forward 
Taylor Timko that kept Michigan 
in the game. Facing Nebraska (1-1-
2 Big Ten, 7-3-2 overall) at U-M 
Soccer Stadium on Sunday, the 
Wolverines (2-1-3, 5-2-6) fought in 
a hotly-contested brawl, ending in 
a 1-1 tie after two, back-and-forth, 
sudden-death overtime periods. 

On an indirect kick just outside 

the 18-yard box, Timko took her 
teammate’s tap in stride. The ball 
was a bullet, powerful enough to 
penetrate the scrum and catapult 
itself into the bottom left corner 
of the net, evening the match at 
one. The goal was not out of the 
ordinary for Timko, as it was her 
fourth on the season.

Michigan’s formation, though, 

was far from the ordinary. Lining 
up in a 5-4-1 configuration, the 
Wolverines 
worked 
to 
assert 

defensive dominance, win the ball, 

connect and counter.

And with Nebraska’s attack, a 

five-back formation was extremely 
beneficial. The Cornhuskers ran a 
three-front offense, highlighted by 
skillful strikers, all able and willing 
to take on their opponents one-on-
one. Often, the outside midfielders 
would push up the wing and join 
the front line, as well.

“Nebraska is going to have a 

go at you,” said Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan. “They’re going to take 
you on and dribble, and if you 
take them on one at a time, you’re 
going to get beat. In our formation, 
if they beat one, there were two 
Wolverines there to deal with 
them. And some of our players had 
never been in the back before, so it 
was all new territory.”

Fifth-year senior Ani Sarkisian, 

typically a midfielder or forward, 
found herself playing centerback 
at the starting whistle.

One reason for Sarkisian’s 

appearance in the back five was 
the sheer number of defenders 

injured. As a two-time captain, 
Sarkisian’s presence as a composed 
player and a steady leader was 
indicative to Michigan’s success.

And 
after 
a 
three-game 

absence, Sarkisian’s presence was 
felt. In fact, it was the foul she 
drew that led to the Wolverines’ 
lone score.

“Our initial goal as a team is to 

not concede any goals,” Sarkisian 
said. “If you don’t concede any 
goals, it’s easier to get the one that 
counts to win the game.”

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, they were the first to 
concede a goal. Off a cross from 
outside the box, Nebraska forward 
Elise Huber finished with a header 
to the near post, taking a 1-0 lead 
30 minutes into the game.

And though Michigan often 

held possession, building slowly 
and smartly from the back, 
the 
Cornhuskers 
completely 

dominated 
the 
shot 
total, 

tallying 25 shots compared to 
the Wolverines’ nine. Freshman 
goalkeeper Hillary Beall was 
a stalwart between the posts, 
boasting six saves on the day.

“She’s very steady,” Ryan said. 

“It’s hard to get a shot past her, 
especially when you’re shooting 
from deep.”

Beall only had to make one save 

during the 20 minutes of extra 
time, though, as her teammates 
came out ready to pressure.

“We said anyone can come out 

and dictate this game and it was 
our opportunity to change our 
minds and go out and change to 
momentum,” Sarkisian said. “I 
think we did. You could see we 
were way more up the field and 
getting better opportunities. It’s 
an in the moment type thing, 
and you really only need one 
opportunity to create something 
and score.”

And though the Wolverines 

weren’t able to find one final 
opportunity for the win, they left 
the pitch with one more point, and 
a lot of season to go.

Wolverines go to double overtime once again, settle for another tie

Flanagan, Michigan 
shine in South Bend

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

cross country team had an 
impressive 
showing 
Friday 

at the Joe Piane Notre Dame 
Invitational in South Bend, 
finishing fourth in a field that 
featured 10 nationally-ranked 
teams out of a total of 21.

Leading the way for the 

Wolverines 
was 
fifth-year 

senior Ben Flanagan, who 
finished 14th out of 177, pacing 
the team with a 24:05.0 time 
on the five-mile course.

“The 
race 

was 
actually 

pretty similar 
to one of the 
resources 
we 

have just off 
of campus (in) 
Rogers Farms,” 
Flanagan 
said. “I think 
we 
came 
in 

kind of with 
a little bit of 
an 
advantage 

understanding 
what to do on 
this 
type 
of 

terrain and (I) 
think that ultimately helped 
quite a bit.”

The fourth-place finish for 

Michigan comes two weeks 
after a first-place finish in the 
Adidas XC Challenge at North 
Carolina State.

This weekend’s invitational 

served as an important outing 
for a team filled with freshmen 
and 
other 
inexperienced 

runners.

“The 
thing 
that 
was 

wonderful about NC State and 
the Michigan Open starting 
things off is it gave guys the 
opportunity 
to 
figure 
out 

where they stood relative to 
other teammates and taught 
them how to work together in 
a smaller field, and ultimately 
run for a very high placing,” 
Flanagan 
said. 
“Whereas 

today, it gave us a lot of an 
understanding of what races 
are like down the road at 
national championships and 
(the Nuttycombe Wisconsin 
Invitational), where there are 
a lot of bodies around.”

The 
Wolverines 
also 

received top-50 finishes from 
fifth-year 
seniors 
Connor 

Mora and Billy Bund, redshirt 
freshman Isaac Harding and 
redshirt sophomores Keenan 
Rebera and Ben Hill, who 
finished 30th, 31st, 35th, 46th 
and 47th respectively.

“A lot of it has to do with 

just preparation 
that 
we 
put 

into this race,” 
Flanagan 
said. 

“Aside from the 
championship 
portion of the 
season, 
with 

the 
Big 
Ten 

(championship), 
regionals 
and 

nationals, 
we 

put 
a 
pretty 

good 
priority 

on this race and 
the 
Wisconsin 

invite 
in 
two 

weeks.”

With momentum building, 

the team is putting itself in 
position 
to 
accomplish 
its 

biggest goal this season: a Big 
Ten championship.

“That’s 
something 
we 

decided on very early, and we 
believe we’re very capable 
of doing (it),” Flanagan said. 
“Nationally is a bit of a harder 
discussion just because of how 
many teams there are and how 
chaotic the meets tend to be.”

With the regular season 

drawing 
to 
a 
close, 
the 

Wolverines 
will 
look 
for 

a 
similar 
performance 
in 

Madison on Oct. 13 when 
they face 34 other teams in 
the Nuttycombe Wisconsin 
Invitational, another marquee 
race for the upward-trending 
team.

Harbaugh makes splash at Water Carnival

Michigan 
football 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh stayed busy 
during 
the 
football 
team’s 

bye week when he dove into 
the pool during the Michigan 
swimming and diving teams’ 
Water Carnival event.

Always 
the 
showman, 

Harbaugh 
had 
agreed 
to 

be a judge for a cannonball 
competition 
but 
was 
then 

baited into diving himself — 
stepping onto the platform 
donning his iconic pair of 
khakis and a Michigan hat 
before executing a near-perfect 
can-opener dive into the pool. 
The crowd went wild, as tweets 
from sports publications across 
the country started pouring 
out 
regarding 
Harbaugh’s 

fully-clothed descent into the 
pool.

“That was just Jim,” said 

Michigan men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving coach 
Mike Bottom. “Jim and I have 
a great relationship — so that 
was like a bait, and he took it, 
and he took it to the next level.”

Harbaugh did indeed take it 

to the next level, both literally 
and figuratively, as he executed 
the dive from the five-meter 
diving board. The cannonball 
competition 
that 
Harbaugh 

was judging was between a 
group of head coaches around 
the athletic department who 
were jumping off the one-
meter board.

The dive took place during 

the Michigan Water Carnival, a 
fun-filled swim meet between 
the Michigan, Oakland and 
Calvin swimming and diving 
teams. This carnival-themed 
meet included a wide array of 
unorthodox events including 
the 300-yard butterfly with 
fins and the 25-yard freestyle 
knockout.

The 
freestyle 
knockout 

was the most intense race of 
the day as swimmers went 
head-to-head in this unique 
competition. The event was 
structured 
so 
that 
eight 

swimmers began the race each 
swimming a 25-yard distance. 

Then, the slowest of the eight 
was 
eliminated, 
reducing 

the competition by one. This 
process was repeated until 
only one swimmer remained 
and earned bragging rights 
around the locker room.

With 
each 
swimmer 

eliminated, 
the 
noise 
level 

increased as the crowd itched 
to see who would be crowned 
the winner. Eventually, it was 
Junior Catie DeLoof who won 
the women’s knockout and senior 
Paul Powers who won the men’s.

The rest of the meet was 

just as wild as former longtime 
diving coach Dick Kimball led 
a clown-themed diving show 
while other events were being 
conducted. The show featured 
members 
of 
the 
Michigan 

diving team, as they completed 
intricate 
dives 
including 

leap frogs, belly flops and 
even a dive off a bicycle. All 
of the divers were wearing 
carnival-themed costumes and 
many were utilizing unique 
props such as umbrellas and 
streamers.

While this event was just 

for kicks, the Wolverines still 
exhibited 
incredible 
talent, 

winning every single event 
except for the final mixed 
400-yard freestyle relay, an 
event they lost by nine one-
hundredths of a second.

This is the first time that 

Michigan 
has 
hosted 
the 

carnival in four years due to 
negotiations with Kimball over 
his eccentric dives.

“Dick was going off the 10 

meter without his hands and 
landing on his head, and I said 
we can’t do this anymore,” 
Bottom said. “The pool’s named 
after him, so I can’t tell him 
what to do — so we couldn’t do 
it until he agreed not to do the 
dive.”

Thankfully, Kimball agreed 

and the Water Carnival is 
now back in the Canham 
Natatorium for all to enjoy.

“We had so much fun, I think 

we’re gonna be calling for it 
every year now,” said junior 
Becca Postoll. “It’s good fun, 
and you don’t get to do stuff 
like this all the time.”

‘M’ defense a threat 
in opening contest

The Michigan hockey team’s 

10 
goals 
against 
Western 

Ontario 
on 
Saturday 
night 

was a spectacle of an offensive 
performance. 
What 
many 

overlooked, though, was how 
pivotal the defense was in 
securing those goals.

Senior defenseman Cutler 

Martin’s 
snipe 
past 
the 

opposing goaltender for the 
Wolverines’ eighth goal against 
the Mustangs was evidence of 
such.

“We have to understand and 

get in the habit of moving the 
puck up quick,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson. 
“We want to 
be 
a 
quick 

transition 
team and try 
to go from our 
defensive zone 
to the offensive 
zone as quick 
as we can.”

Pearson’s 
sentiment 
is 

consistent 
with 
the 
way 

the 
Wolverines’ 
blueliners 

performed 
in 
their 
first 

exhibition match.

“I think that coming back 

— this is going to be my fourth 
year — the defense has a good 
footing on what we need to 
do,” Martin said prior to the 
exhibition Saturday. “We need 
to play defense first, have that 
mindset, be aggressive, be mean 
on the ice.”

And mean they were.
Immediately at the onset 

of the matchup, sophomore 
defenseman Luke Martin fired 
off a shot from the blue line that 
found its way into the net off a 
deflection from senior forward 
Dexter Dancs.

Throughout 
the 
night, 

the 
defense 
simultaneously 

protected the Michigan net 
while forcing a plethora of 

scoring opportunities for the 
offense, giving the whole squad 
a weapon behind the blue line.

In the second period, Martin 

assisted fifth-year senior forward 
Alex Roos, and junior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi assisted senior 
forward Tony Calderone.

Then, in the third period, 

Luke Martin assisted junior 
forward 
Cooper 
Marody, 

junior 
defenseman 
Nicholas 

Boka assisted Martin, Cecconi 
assisted 
sophomore 
forward 

Jake Slaker and Boka again 
assisted 
sophomore 
forward 

James Sanchez.

In total, the Wolverines’ 

defense racked up nine points, 

proving just how 
multi-faceted the 
team may be this 
year.

From 
the 

crisp passing to 
the 
multitude 

of 
scoring 

opportunities 
from every point 
around the ice, 
the 
Michigan 

offensive 
effort 

— which includes the defense 
in this scenario — seemed cool, 
composed and deadly.

“I think it’s guys just buying 

into the system,” Calderone 
said. “I think a lot of guys are 
starting to hold onto the puck 
more, getting more confident.”

In a game that most regard 

as 
an 
easy 
matchup, 
the 

Wolverines certainly showed 
that their aggressive mentality 
works.

And while some might argue 

Saturday’s outburst came in a 
meaningless exhibition game, 
one would only need to look 
back at last year’s exhibition 
for a sign of growth. Against 
Windsor, last season’s Michigan 
defense recorded zero points. 
This much of an improvement 
in a year’s time shows that 
Pearson’s 
master 
plan 
may 

result in a higher-powered 
attack from both ends of the ice.

I think it’s guys 
just buying into 

the system.

Harbaugh names O’Korn as starter

Opportunities like this don’t 

come around very often.

And yet, here it is: after 

transferring 
and 
patiently 

sitting out a year, after losing 
the starting competition twice, 
John O’Korn is now the starting 
quarterback for No. 7 Michigan 
as it heads into the biggest 
matchup of the season thus far, 
a night game at home against 
in-state rival Michigan State.

“(Wilton’s) going to be out,” 

said Jim Harbaugh on Monday 
afternoon. “John O’Korn will 
be the starter.”

It won’t be known until later 

in the season whether the job 
is permanently in O’Korn’s 
grasp. For all we know, he may 
have earned the job outright 
by 
leading 
the 
Wolverines 

to a comeback victory over 
Purdue two weekends ago. But 
Harbaugh announced redshirt 
junior Wilton Speight “won’t 
be able to compete this week, 

or for multiple weeks,” which 
means this case won’t be 
reopened for quite some time.

Until then — and maybe even 

for the rest of the season — this 
is the John O’Korn Show.

“John’s 
done 
a 
fantastic 

job ever since he got here,” 
Harbaugh said. “Every role 
that he’s been in, he’s acquitted 
himself very well, including 
coming off the bench and 
leading our team to a victory 
against Purdue. I think that 
speaks volumes.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

fullback Khalid Hill: “Being a 
quarterback, you’ve got to be 
ready. I think John did a great 
job (against) Purdue, coming 
in and performing the way he 
did, but that is expected from 
everybody. Coach Harbaugh 
always says, ‘Next man up,’ so 
always got to be on your Ps and 
Qs because you never know 
when your time is called.”

O’Korn, 
who 
completed 

17-of-26 passes for 270 yards 
with 
one 
touchdown 
and 

an interception against the 
Boilermakers, appears to have 
earned the full confidence of 
his teammates.

“... (O’Korn) just came in 

composed, he came and he was 
ready,” Hill said. “I applaud 
him for coming in and playing 
the way that he did, because 
you 
don’t 
expect 
that 
to 

happen.”

For Hill, the difference in 

O’Korn’s demeanor has been 
noticeable. According to him, 
O’Korn spoke the other day 
about taking his time after 
feeling like he was always 
facing 
pressure. 
Now, 
Hill 

says, O’Korn is taking a more 
relaxed approach by letting 
things come to him.

And while senior offensive 

tackle Mason Cole couldn’t 
speak to that — he grinned as 
he said he has no idea what 
O’Korn does as he blocks for 
him — he still agreed with Hill 
on O’Korn’s readiness.

“When he came into the 

game, the transition was just 

really effortless,” Cole said. 
“He came in like he’s been 
there all year, and I think that’s 
the biggest thing — we knew 
he’d be ready to play if he had 
to, and he was.

“... We knew the talent John 

had and we knew he would get 
the job done if he had to go in, 
and he has.”

In the offseason, O’Korn 

spoke candidly about dealing 
with the loss of his confidence 
after 
transferring 
from 

Houston and struggling early 
on at Michigan. The hiring of 
passing game coordinator Pep 
Hamilton, he said, reignited 
his game and brought him to a 
level he had never seen before.

Now, Michigan will get a full 

chance to see what that level is.

“That gives you confidence 

— your quarterback comes and 
performs ... the way he did, 
it gives you confidence and 
John’s going to hopefully do 
the same thing this week,” Hill 
said. “I know he’s preparing to 
have the best game of his life.”

Fifth-year senior quarterback John O’Korn was named Michigan’s starting quarterback, as Wilton Speight remains sidelined with an injury sustained at Purdue.

Michigan football player 

Nate Johnson was arrested 
over the weekend for an 
alleged assault that took 
place Sept. 30.

a 
female 

student outside South Quad 
Residence Hall shortly after 
2 a.m. Saturday morning. 
The woman reported she had

located nearby.

Johnson was arrested on 

charges of domestic violence 
and taken to jail, where he was 
arraigned on Oct. 1 for one 
count of domestic violence. 
He was released on a $5,000 
personal recognizance bond 
and a pre-trial hearing is

been suspended indefinitely 
from all team activities.

A spokesperson for the

arrest, instead referring to 
the original statement of 
Johnson’s suspension.

For Hill, Michigan State rivalry is ‘personal’

Two 
years 
ago, 
when 

cornerback Lavert Hill was 
still a high schooler, he sat 
in the stands at Michigan 
Stadium, watching one of the 
most unbelievable finishes to a 
college football game the world 
had ever seen.

Hill 
stood 
in 
shock 
as 

Michigan State’s Jalen Watt-
Jackson carried a mishandled 
punt all the way into the end 
zone for a last-second, game-
winning touchdown.

Then a senior at Martin 

Luther King High School in 
Detroit, Hill was one of the 
nation’s 
most 
sought-after 

recruits. 
Besides 
Michigan, 

his top choices included Penn 
State, 
Southern 
California, 

Tennessee, Clemson and — most 
importantly — Michigan State.

The decision came down to 

the two in-state schools, and 
he ultimately decided on Ann 
Arbor and joined coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s first full recruiting 
class. Academic, athletic and 
personal reasons — his older 
brother Delano played for the 
Wolverines — swayed Hill to 
Michigan.

Two years later, Hill is now 

a starting defensive back for 
the seventh-ranked Wolverines 
(1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 overall), and 
this weekend he will finally 
have the opportunity to make 
his mark on the Michigan-
Michigan State rivalry.

“It was pretty devastating,” 

Hill said of Michigan’s 2015 loss 
to the Spartans. “This game is 
pretty personal to me.”

He prepared over the bye 

week by tuning in as Michigan 
State (1-0 Big Ten, 3-1 overall) 
defeated Iowa, 17-10.

Hill paid close attention to 

Michigan State wide receiver 
Felton Davis III, who caught 
two touchdowns and recorded 
a career-high 114 receiving 
yards. As the Spartans’ top 

target, 
Davis 
averages 
64 

receiving yards per game, and 
he was named the co-Big Ten 
Offensive Player of the Week 
for his performance against the 
Hawkeyes.

Hill and the rest of the 

Wolverines’ 
secondary 

understand how important it 
will be to shut Davis down.

“(Davis) is a pretty good 

athlete,” Hill said. “He knows 
how to track the ball in the air. 
We just got to get our hands on 
him, disturb him on the line… 
We expect him to do what he 
can, but we’ll be ready also.”

Hill also discussed Michigan 

State 
quarterback 
Brian 

Lewerke, mentioning his ability 
to extend plays with his feet.

Lewerke’s first touchdown 

throw to Davis last weekend 

came on a rollout to the right. 
He gave himself time to find 
an open receiver and Iowa’s 
secondary 
couldn’t 
stay 

disciplined in coverage.

Hill 

said 
that 
a 

cornerback 
can 
never 

lose sight of 
its mark if it 
wants to guard 
the 
type 
of 

passing threat 
that 
Lewerke 

brings to the 
game.

“Don’t 
look 

back at the quarterback until 
the ball is in the air and you 
know that you can get it,” Hill 
said. “Have your eyes on your 
man.”

Ultimately, 
Michigan’s 

secondary 
should 
be 
ready 

for Michigan State, especially 
having had a week off to prepare. 
With three interceptions and 

two 
pick-sixes 

— one of which 
belongs to Hill — 
the 
Wolverines 

have allowed just 
134 passing yards 
per game, ranking 
as the fourth-best 
passing 
defense 

in the nation.

Although 

young, 
the 

secondary 
and 

Hill have proved they can stop 
opponents in the air. Lewerke, 
Davis and Michigan State will 
be their toughest opponent yet, 
but Hill believes the Wolverines 

will succeed if they continue 
communicating and adjusting 
well.

And while Hill has been 

waiting to participate in the 
rivalry, he knows he has to stay 
focused on the task at hand. He 
can’t get too caught up in the 
excitement.

But that’s pretty hard when 

you have to play under the 
lights, at primetime, against 
your rival and against former 
high school teammates and 
foes.

All that will be the case when 

Hill suits up this weekend for 
the first Michigan-Michigan 
State game in Ann Arbor since 
the fateful botched punt in 2015.

“We can’t lose at home,” Hill 

said. “We’re going to have to get 
after it Saturday.”
