'U' received grant
from State Dept. to
open similar clinic to
one in Ann Arbor
By SARA BOBOLTZ
Daily StaffReporter
The University Law School
recently received a $300,000 grant
to expand its work fighting human
trafficking to the international
arena.
The grant comes from the U.S.
Department of State's Office to
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in
Persons and it will be used to help
the Law School opena clinic in
Zacatecas, Mexico that will accept
cases dealing with human traf-
ficking. The clinic's structure will
be modeled after the University's
existing Law School Human Traf-
ficking Clinic, which was launched
in 2009 as the first clinic of its kind,
according to a press release distrib-
uted last week.
Bridgette Carr, the clinic's
director, said in the press release
that the grant will enable the clinic
to extend the work law students do
in Ann Arbor to the international
level.
"By awarding us the grant, the
State Department acknowledged
that the success of our clinic could
be replicated elsewhere," Carr said
in the press release. "We're excited

about this new venture and look
forward to helping victims in Mex-
ico."
Establishing the clinic will
require a combined effort from the
University of Michigan, the law
school Unidad Acaddmica de Dere-
cho at the Universidad de Aut6no-
ma de Zacatecas and Centro de
los Derechos del Migrante, Inc., a
non-governmental organization
that aims to promote awareness
of workplace rights in the United
States for migrant workers.
Stephen Warnath, director of the
NEXUS Institute, an anti-human
trafficking organization based in
Washington D.C., will also act as
a partner on the project. Warnath
will help analyze the success of the
project at its completion, according
to clinical fellow Meredith Weill,
who is assisting with the project.
Several University law students
will accompany Carr and Weill to
Mexico, where the group will train
students and faculty from the Uni-
versidad de Autonoma de Zacate-
cas and help with various cases.
Weill said that though the group
will draw on lessons learned from
the University's human traffick-
ing clinic, the new clinic won't be
identical. Instead the clinic will be
largely in the hands of the Mexican
institutions.
"We're not exporting Ameri-
can clinical education," Weill said.
"The idea is that we have expertise,
we'll be a resource for them, we'll

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
At a ceremony on campus to
formalize a new joint partnership
with a leading Chinese Univer-
sity yesterday, University officials
strongly reaffirmed their support

for interna-
tional collabo-
ration.
The signing
ceremony was
meant tobe an
opportunity
for represen- KYLE SWANSON
tatives from Covering the
the University A . ion
of Michigan Admmistrat
Health System and Peking Uni-
versity Health Science Center to
formally sign an agreement to
establish a $14-million partner-
ship to focus on cardiac, liver and

pulmonary diseases. However,
throughout the event, officials
from the University focused on
the importance of partnerships
with Chinese institutions.
The defense of the Univer-
sity's Chinese partnerships came
while a small group of critics who
oppose the University's involve-
ment with China sat among the
audience. And while the critics -
including some who have spoken
publicly before the University's
Board of Regents about their con-
cerns in regards to the University
giving too much attention and

preference to China while issues
confront the University at home
- didn't publicly protest during
the event, University organizers
read a statement at the start of the
ceremony to warn against inter-
rupting the event.
Speaking at the event, Ora
Pescovitz, the University's execu-
tive vice president for medical
affairs, emphasized the impor-
tance of partnering with Peking
University Health Science Center.

drug's effects on
different conditions
By SUZANNE JACOBS
DailyStaffReporter
Though medical marijuana was
legalized in Michigan in 2008,
debate is still raging over which
patients are eligible to use the

treatment.
According to the Michigan
Medical Marijuana Act, medical
patients in the state of Michigan
who want to use marijuana to treat
their conditions must first obtain
registry identification cards from
the Michigan Department of Com-
munity Health - a process that
has ignited controversy over who
should be allowed to use the drug.
And with limited research on the
drug that is backed by the federal
government, many physicians are
hesitant to suggest it asa treatment

option, though patients and advo-
cates swear by the drug's medical
efficacy.
Between April 6, 2009 and Oct.
8, 2010, the department received
65,816 new or renewal applications.
So far it has approved 35,802 and
denied 7,938 of those applications.
Most of the denied applications
were incomplete, according to the
department's website.
To apply for a card, a patient
needs written certification from a
licensed physician verifying that

By ROBIN VEECK
Daily StaffReporter
Members of the Open Housing
Initiative were optimistic at last
night's Michigan Student Assem-

bly meeting about the possibility of
making gender-neutral housing an
option available to students next
fall.
Allison Horky, co-chair of the
Spectrum Center Student Advisory
Board, spoke at last night's meet-
ing about the Open Housing Ini-
tiative's progress and goals for the
coming months. The student group
is currently assembling a report to

"We needed a more detailed

Sharing his way to

Molecular, Cellular and Devel-
opmental Biology Prof. Robert
Bender doesn't consider himself a
teacher. Instead, he views his work
in the classroom and laboratory as
"shared learning."
"We're notan institution of high-
er teaching. We're an institution of
higher learning," Bender said. "The
fun thing that I like to do is learn,
and then let mystudents come along
with me and see how I learn and
share my ability to learn."
Bender's interest in shared
learning influenced his decision to
become a high school teacher after
graduating from the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology with a
Bachelor of Science in life sciences
in 1968.
"When I left college I was the
right age, but very young. I was
terrified of the aggressiveness of
molecular biology. I thought, 'I can't
hack this, but I love this.' I loved

sharing the learning process so I
went off and taughthigh school," he
said. "I thought that teaching high
school would keep me forever, but
after a few years my fingers itched
and then it was off to graduate
school."
Bender returned to MIT and
earned his Ph.D. in Microbiol-
ogy in 1976. His decision to pursue
research and teach at the University
was the result of the University's
honesty during the interview pro-
cess.
"(The University of) Michigan
didn't promise anything it couldn't
confirm in writing," he said.
Shortly after taking the position,
the National Institutes of Health
approached Bender with an idea.
He began working on a study of the
Nitrogen Assimilation Control pro-
tein in 1979 and has since continued
to research the NAC in his laborato-
ry in the Natural Sciences Building.

learningE
Bender credits his success in
receiving grants to continue study-
ing the NAC proteins for 30 years to
his writing abilities.k
"I've gone 30 years without ever"
havingto resubmit a grant," he said.
"Each time I've sent it in it was
funded. Part of that is because of my
English training."
When it came down to decid-
ing on his major as an undergradu-
ate, Bender said he was deciding
between comparative literature and
life sciences.
"People still had a much broader
view of intellectual activity. And
now because science is so much
bigger and there is so much of it
and the educational system has
changed so much, people are much
more tracked and much less broadly
exposed - and that's kind of tragic,"
he said. "But hey, the world Chang-"

Peace council members Two more suspects charged

in Afghanistan request
peace gesture from U.S.

in NYC anti-gay beatings

a

Members of council
ask for release of
prisoners in
Guantanamo Bay
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP).
- Releasing Taliban figures
detained at Guantanamo Bay and
scratching scores of others off the
U.N. sanctions list would jump-
start peace talks aimed at ending
the 9-year-old war, members of
Afghanistan's new peace council
said yesterday.
The council members, who
hold their first business meeting
yesterday, said goodwill gestures
from the U.S. and international
community could spur reconcili-
ation talks - perhaps at a neutral
location in Saudi Arabia, Turk-
menistan, Egypt or Turkey.
The momentum for a political
solution has been slowly build-
ing in Afghanistan as public sup-
port for the war has waned in the
West. The renewed push for peace
comes as the last of 30,000 U.S.
reinforcements have arrived in
Afghanistan, pushing deeper into
areas long held by insurgents.
Many top military and diplo-
matic leaders have publicly sup-
ported peace efforts, though they
remain skeptical that insurgents
are ready to lay down their arms,
embrace the Afghan constitution
and sever ties with al-Qaida and
other terrorist networks.
Ethnic minorities and women,
who were repressed under the
Taliban, have expressed concerns
about what any deal with the mili-
tants would bring. Most members
of the Taliban are Pashtuns, the
largest ethnic group in Afghani-
stan. The minority Tajiks, Uzbeks
and Hazaras are not likely to sit
quietly on the sidelines if Karzai, a
Pashtun, makes a deal with insur-
gents.
But Staffan de Mistura, the top
U.N. envoy in Afghanistan, said
all parties including the Taliban
know there is no military solu-
tion to the conflict. He predicted

the next several months will be
particularly violent because both
the Taliban and international
forces will be applying maximum
pressure on each other to position
themselves for possible negotia-
tion.
In hopes of finding a peace-
ful resolution, Afghan President
Hamid Karzai recently set up the
68-member council to guide for-
mal talks with the armed opposi-
tion.
Karzai said this week that his
government has been talking with
the Taliban "countryman to coun-
tryman" for "quite some time." He
characterized the talks as unof-
ficial personal contacts - not
official contact with the Taliban
leadership.
"That hasn't happened yet and
we hope we can begin that as soon
as possible," Karzai said.
Arsala Rahmani, a member
of the peace council who served
as deputy education minister in
the former Taliban regime, said
yesterday that discussions were
under way for the United States or
United Nations to guarantee safe
passage for representatives of mil-
itant groups to meet somewhere
outside of Afghanistan, Pakistan
and Iran to discuss ways to recon-
cile with the Afghan government.
Rahmani, who insisted he was not
speaking on behalf of the entire
council, said neutral meeting sites
under discussion were in Saudi
Arabia, Turkey, Turkmenistan
and Egypt.
Rahmani said trust must be
established between the Taliban
and the U.S. and other Western
players. Release of four or five top
Taliban prisoners from the U.S.
detention center at Guantanamo
Bay and the de-listingof about150
individuals linked to the Taliban
from the U.N. sanctions list are
the key stumbling blocks to nego-
tiating peace, he said.
A second member of the peace
council, who spoke on condition
of anonymity because of the sensi-
tivity of the issue, said the Taliban
will show more flexibility if such
measures are taken.

"When that trust can be estab-
lished, the political process can
move forward," Rahmani said.
Publicly, the Taliban have
rejected the peace council, calling
it an "American initiative to delay
the withdrawal of foreign troops
from Afghanistan."
In Washington, State Depart-
ment spokesman P.J. Crowley said
the U.S. was considering modifi-
cations to the U.N. sanctions list,
but that the matter of releasing
prisoners from Guantanamo Bay
was unrelated to the Afghan peace
process.
"On an ongoing basis we are
evaluating modifications to the
individuals on the sanctions list at
the U.N.," Crowley said yesterday.
"We've made some adjustments
during the course of this year.
And as we work through issues
and, you know, in collaboration
with the U.N. and other members
of the U.N. Security Council, that
is certainly possible."
Rahmani and the other mem-
ber of the peace council also
said Pakistan should release or
give Afghanistan custody of its
Afghan prisoners, including the
Afghan Taliban's No. 2 leader,
Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
Baradar was arrested in Febru-
ary in a joint raid with the CIA
- a move some analysts believe
was driven by Pakistan's desire
to guarantee itself a seat at the
negotiating table. Rahmani said
Baradar was one of 31 Afghan
Taliban figures being held in
Pakistan because they were will-
ing to talk peace.
"We don't know where they are,
whether in prison in Pakistan, or
maybe living comfortable in guest
houses," he said.
Pakistani Prime Minister You-
suf Raza Gilani tried to dispel
concerns about his country's role
when asked about Taliban peace
talks Tuesday, but also reminded
observers of the leverage Pakistan
has in the process.
"Look, nothing can happen
without us because we are part
of the solution. We are not part of
the problem," Gilani paid.

Ten suspects total
arraigned on
hate-crime charges
NEW YORK (AP) - Two addi-
tional suspects were charged yes-
terday in several brutal attacks that
authoritiesnbelieve weretouched off
because gang members thought one
of their recruits was gay.
A tenthsuspect, 22-year-old Jose
Dominguez, surrendered to detec-
tives yesterday and was arraigned
in the Bronx Criminal Court on
charges of gang assault, sexual
abuse and unlawful imprisonment
as hate crimes. It wasn't clear if he
had an attorney. No one answered
the phone at an address provided
by police.
A suspect who was arrested

Monday, Ruddy Vargas-Perez, was
arraigned yesterday on charges
including robbery, gang assault and
unlawful imprisonment as hate
crimes.
Benjamin Heinrich, an attorney
for Vargas-Perez, said his client
was innocent and denied that he
was even present at the attacks.
He described Vargas-Perez as a
hardworking carpenter and fam-
ily man.
Police say Dominguez and Var-
gas-Perez participated in at least
one of the attacks on two teens and
two men on Oct. 3.
Members of a street gang who
called themselves the Latin King
Goonies targeted a 30-year-old
gay man after he apparently had a
sexual encounter with one of their
recruits, authorities said.
The 17-year-old was beaten and

sodomized with the handle of a
plunger until he confessed to his
involvement with the older man,
authoritiessaid. The mob later went
after the 30-year-old, luring him to
an abandoned apartment they used
for partying, where they tied him
to a chair and assaulted him, police
said.
Another 17-year-old was also
attacked because it was believed
he too had an encounter with the
30-year-old man, and the older
man's brother was also attacked
after gang members went to their
shared apartment and robbed the
place of cash and a TV, police said.
Initially, authorities said nine
people participated in the attacks,
but later concluded there were 10.
Police say Dominguez has been
accused of hitting the first victim
with a pipe.

Granholm vetoes
bill to allow Sunday
liquor sales
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm vetoed a bill yesterday that
would have allowed Sunday morn-
ing liquor sales and another mea-
sure spelling out how $316 million
in federal money should be spent on
public schools.
She said the liquor bill could
open the state to a costly lawsuit
while the schools bill could have
jeopardized the federal funding.
The vetoes leave lawmakers
with more work to be done on the
current budget. The Michigan
Licensed Beverage Association,
which has lobbied to expand liquor
sales, called the governor's veto
"baffling."
The liquor sales bill was approved
just before the new budget took
effect Oct. 1 and was estimated to
bring in more than $500,000 to the
general fund.
The veto of the education mea-
sure doesn't affect the $13 billion
school aid budget passed earlier
this year, but it could keep school
districts from getting the higher
per-pupil amounts they were prom-
ised until the bill is fixed.
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.
Calif. agency pulls
stem cell poetry off
website
An attempt to lighten up the
heavy subject of stem cells through
poetry has backfired on the Califor-
nia agency that manages the state's
$3 billion research fund.
The California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine decided to
hold a poetry contest to commemo-
rate Stem Cell Awareness Day last
Wednesday. But it later pulled the
winning entries from its website
because of religious language in
one of the works.
The poem "Stem C." begins,
"This is my body/which is given for
you," and ends with, "Take this/in
remembrance of me."
The words echo language used
during Holy Communion in many
Christian churches.
The conservative California
Family Council called the poem
blasphemous.
CAIRO
Egypt sets new
rules on SMS for
upcoming elections
Egypt's telecommunications
regulator has set new rules for com-
panies sending text messages to
multiple mobile phones, in a move
activists say will stifle efforts to
mobilize voters ahead of upcoming
parliamentary elections.
Reform groups in Egypt, as well
as elsewhere in the region such as
Iran, have increasingly relied on
the internet and mobile phones to
organize, mobilize and evade gov-
ernment harassment.

Mahmoud el-Gweini, adviser to
the Egyptian telecommunication
minister, told The Associated Press
yesterday that companies sending
out text messages - known as SMS
aggregators - must now obtain
licenses.
The decision was not meant to
curb political activity, he said, but
was spurred by concerns that "ran-
dom" text messages concerning
sensitive issues such as religious
tension or the stock market could
be sent to consumers.
PHILADELPHIA
Man arrested after
streaking at rally
Billionaire Alki David says a
man arrested after streaking at
President Barack Obama's week-
end rally in Philadelphia was try-
ing to win a $1 million Internet
challenge.
Police say 24-year-old Juan J.
Rodriguez of New York City was
charged with indecent exposure,
public lewdness and disorderly
conduct on Sunday. Rodriguez
was arraigned Monday night and
released on a $10,000 signature
bond.
David recently offered $1 mil-
lion to anyone who could streak
in front of Obama with the name
of David's competition website
on his chest. David told The
Philadelphia Inquirer and Phila-
delphia Daily News that he is
an Obama fan but streaking is
a time-honored way of getting
attention.

Judge calls for
immediate halt
to 'don't ask,
don'It tell' policy

Justice department
attorneys have 60
days to respond to
federal judicial order
SAN DIEGO (AP) - A federal
judge ordered the military yester-
day to immediately stop enforc-
ing its ban on openly gay troops,
bringing the 17-year "don't ask,
don't tell" policy closer than it has
ever been to beingabolished.
Justice Department attorneys
have 60 days to appeal the injunc-
tion but did not say what their
next step would be.
President Barack Obama has
backed a Democratic effort in
Congress to repeal the law, rather
than in an executive order or in
court.
But U.S. District Judge Vir-
ginia Phillips' injunction leaves
the administration with a choice:
Continue defending a law it
opposes with an appeal, or do
nothing, let the policy be over-
turned, and add an explosive
issue to a midterm election with
Republicans poised to make
major gains.
Department of Justice and
Pentagon officials were review-
ing the judge's decision and said
they had no immediate comment.
"The whole thing has become
a giant game of hot potato," said
Diane H. Mazur, a legal expert
at the Palm Center, a think tank
at the University of California
at Santa Barbara that supports a
repeal. "There isn't anyone who
wants to be responsible, it seems,
for actually ending this policy.
"The potato has been passed
around so manytimes that I think
the grown-up in the roomis going
to be the federal courts."
A federal judge in Tacoma,
Wash., ruled in a different case
last month that a decorated flight
nurse discharged from the Air
Force for being gay should be
given her job back.
Phillips, based in Riverside,
Calif., issued a landmark ruling
on Sept. 9, declaring the policy
unconstitutional and asked both
sides to give her input about an
injunction. The judge said the
policy violates due process rights,
freedom of speech and the right
to petition the government for
redress of grievances guaranteed
by the First Amendment.

Gay rights groups hailed Phil-
lips' latest move, crediting her
with what the administration and
Washington have not been able to
do.
"For a single federal judge
to tell the government to stop
enforcing this policy worldwide,
this afternoon, with no time to
think about it or plan for it, is
almost unprecedented," said
Richard Socarides, a former Clin-
ton White House adviser on gay
rights.
"This judge was sure. There
was nothing in her mind that
could justify this even for one
more day, one more hour."
Gay rights advocates, howev-
er, tempered their celebrations,
warning service members to
avoid revealing their sexuality for
fear that the injunction could be
tossed out during an appeal and
they would be left open to being
discharged.
If the government does not
appeal, the injunction cannot
be reversed and would remain
in effect. If it does, it can seek
a temporary freeze, or stay, of
her ruling. An appeal would go
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 9th Circuit. Either side could
then take it to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
The Pentagon did not imme-
diately comment, and a Justice
Department spokeswoman said
the government was reviewing
the decision. Meanwhile, a group
of 19 Democrat senators signed a
letter sent to U.S. Attorney Gen-
eral Eric Holder urging him to let
the injunction stand.
A "don't ask, don't tell" sup-
porter said Phillips overstepped
her bounds.
"The judge ignored the evi-
dence to impose her ill-informed
and biased opinion on our mili-
tary, endangering morale, health
and security of our military at a
time of war," said Wendy Wright,
president of Concerned Women
for America, a public policy
group.
Wright said Phillips should
have let Congress continue to
investigate the impact of the
repeal.
Phillips' order goes into effect
immediately, said Dan Woods,
the attorney who represented the
Log Cabin Republicans, the gay
rights group that filed the lawsuit
in 2004 to stop the ban's enforce-
ment.

In this photo released by the Chilean government, Chile's Health Minister Jaime Manalich, left, looks at the rescue capsule that
will be used to rescue the 33 trapped miners one by one from the collapsed San Jose mine in Copiapo, Chile, on Tuesday Oct.
12, 2010.
Escape capsule rescues
trapped Chilean miners

The 33 miners have
been trapped nearly
a half mile under-
ground for 69 days
SAN JOSE MINE, Chile (AP)
- To hugs, cheers and tears, res-
cuers using a missile-like escape
capsule began pulling 33 men one
by one to fresh air and freedom at
last early today, 69 days after they
were trapped in a collapsed mine
almost a half-mile underground.
Rescued first was Florencio
Avalos, who wore a helmet and
sunglasses to protect him from
the glare of bright lights. He
smiled broadly as he emerged and
hugged his sobbing 7-year-old
son, Bairon, and wife, then got a
bearhug from Chilean President
Sebastian Pinera shortly after
midnight local time.
A second miner, Mario Sepulve-
da Espina, was pulled to the surface
about an hour later - his shouts
heard even before the capsule sur-
faced. After hugging his wife, Elvi-
ra, he jubilantly handed souvenir
rocks from his underground prison
to laughing rescuers.
Then he jumped up and down
as if to prove his strength to
everyone before the medical team
took him into a triage unit.
Eachrideuptheshaft wasexpect-
ed to take about 20 minutes, and
authorities were working to haul
up one miner per hour at the site
in the chilly Chilean desert. When
the last man surfaces, it promises
to end a national crisis that began
when 700,000 tons of rock collapsed
Aug. 5, sealing the men in the lower

reaches ofthe mine.
The miners captivated the
world with their endurance and
unity as Chile meticulously pre-
pared their rescue.
After the first capsule came
out of the manhole-sized open-
ing, Avalos emerged as bystanders
cheered, clapped and broke into
a chant of "Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le!
Le!" - the country's name.
Avalos gave a thumbs-up as
he was led to an ambulance and
medical tests following his more
than two months deep below the
Chilean desert - the longest any-
one has ever been trapped under-
ground and survived.
Avalos, the 31-year-old sec-
ond-in-command of the miners,
was chosen to be first because he
was in the best condition. He has
been so shy that he volunteered
to handle the camera rescuers
sent down so he wouldn't have to
appear on the videos that the min-
ers sent up.
Pinera later explained that they
had not planned for Avalos' fam-
ily to join rescuers at the opening
of the shaft, but that little Bairon.
insisted on being there.
"I told Florencio that few times
have I ever seen a son show so
much love for his father," the
president said.
"This won't be over until all 33
are out," he added. "Hopefully the
spirit of these miners will remain
forever with us. ... This country is
capable of great things."
Minutes earlier, mine rescue
expert Manuel Gonzalez of the
state copper company Codelco
grinned and made the sign of the
cross as he was lowered to the
trapped' men - apparently with-

out incident. He was followed by
Roberto Ros, a paramedic with
the Chilean navy's special forces.
Together they will prepare the
miners for their rescue - expect-
ed to take as many as 36 hours for
all to surface.
"We made a promise to never
surrender, and we kept it," Pinera
said as he waited to greetthe min-
ers, whose endurance and unity
captivated the world as Chile
meticulously prepared their res-
cue.
The last miner out has been
decided: Shift foreman Luis
Urzua, whose leadership was
credited for helping the men
endure 17 days with no out-
side contact after the collapse.
The men made 48 hours' worth
of rations last before rescuers
reached them with a narrow
borehole to send down more food.
Janette Marin, sister-in-law
of miner Dario Segovia, said the
order of rescue didn't matter.
"This won't be a success unless
they all get out," she said, echo-
ing the solidarity that the min-
ers and people across Chile have
expressed.
The paramedics can change the
order of rescue based on a brief
medical check once they're in
the mine. First out will be those
best able to handle any difficul-
ties and tell their comrades what
to expect. Then, the weakest and
the ill - in this case, about 10 suf-
fer from hypertension, diabetes,
dental and respiratory infections
and skin lesions from the mine's
oppressive humidity. The last
should be people who are both
physically fit and strong of char-
acter.

Fastest-growing U.S. areas show big income drop

Census shows
Hispanics driving
growth in South
WASHINGTON (AP) - Call it
the migration bust: Many of the
fast-growing U.S. areas during the
housing boom are now yielding
some of the biggest income-drops
in the economic downturn.
That could have broad impact
on the political map in the coming
weeks. Voters discontent over the
economy and related issues such as
immigration head to the polls on
Nov. 2 to decide whether to keep
Democrats in Congress.
Whites and blacks have taken
big hits since 2007 in once-torrid
Sunbelt regions offering warm
climates and open spaces, includ-
ing Florida, Colorado, Arizona and
Nevada, according to 2009 census
data. Hispanics suffered paycheck
losses in many "new immigrant"
destinations in the interior U.S.,
which previously offered con-
struction jobs and affordable hous-
ing, such as Tennessee, Georgia
and North Carolina.
The few bright spots: Wash-
ington, D.C., San Jose, Calif.,
San Francisco and Boston. Their
household incomes remained
among the highest in the nation
last year partly due to steady
demand for government and high-
tech work.
"As a whole, the income chang-
es represent a sharp U-turn from
the mid-decade gains," said Wil-
liam H. Frey, a demographer at
the Brookings Institution who
reviewed the household income
data. "The last two years have left
those who couldn't move stuck in
place with lower incomes."
In December, the Census
Bureau will release 2010 popu-
lation counts, which trigger a
politically contentious process of

divvying up House seats. In all,
Southern and Western states are
expected to take seats away the
Midwest and Northeast. But last-
minute shifts could affect a hand-
ful of states hanging in the balance,
including California, which is hop-
ing to avoid losing its first seat ever,
and Arizona, which may now gain
just one seat rather than two based
partly on slowing Hispanic popu-
lation growth.
The census data show that His-
panics, the nation's largest and
fastest-growing minority group,
are helping drive growth in several
Southern states.
Five states have seen their num-
bers double over the last decade
- South Carolina, Tennessee,
Alabama and Arkansas in the
South and South Dakota in the
Upper Midwest. Other big gain-
ers include Georgia and North
Carolina.
Several of those states, South
Carolina, Georgia and possibly
North Carolina, stand to gain
House seatsbased partly on that
fast growth.
At the same time, the Latino
population remains a relatively
smaller share of the popula-
tion in those states, numbering
about 8 percent or less. There,
they also tend to be dispropor-
tionately low-income workers
who lack a high-school educa-
tion, speak mostly Spanish and
don't vote in elections, which
analysts say may be driving
some of the tensions over immi-
gration and jobs.
In recent months, the rheto-
ric has ranged from a call for
English-only policies in states
and localities that wish to mini-
mize the use of Spanish and
other languages, to a call to strip
birthright citizenship for illegal
immigrants.
"Hispanics' recent growth
and sharp disparity with exist-

ing white populations may have
something to do with the anti-
immigrant backlash now being
observed in large parts of the
country," Frey said.
Hispanics had the highest
income in metro areas such as
Washington, D.C., Baltimore,
Dayton, Ohio, and Virginia Beach,
where they also were more likely to
have a college degree. Lower-edu-
cated Hispanics also had strong
earnings in San Francisco and San
Jose, Calif., two areas with high
costs of living where more-afford-
able immigrant labor tends to be in
greater demand.
Nationally, the government

reported last month that median
household incomes dipped to
$49,777, the lowest since 1997,
with the sharpest drop-offs in
the Midwest and Northeast. Bro-
ken down by race, blacks had the
biggest income losses, dropping
to $32,584. They were followed
by non-Hispanic whites, whose
income fell to $54,461. Asian
incomes remained flat at $65,469.
Income among Hispanics edged
higher but lagged whites signifi-
cantly at $38,039.
The findings are part of a
broad array of 2009 data released
over the past month that have
highlighted the impact of the

recession - from soaring poverty
and a widening gap between rich
and poor to record levels of food
stamp use.
Yesterday, the Census Bureau
posted additional 2009 findings.
Among them:
-Declining home values. Medi-
an values for owner-occupied
homes dropped 5.8 percent last
year to $185,200. They ranged
from a high of $638,300 in San
Jose, Calif., to a low of $76,100 in
McAllen, Texas. In all, five of the
10 highest property values were
located in California, with the rest
in New York, Washington, D.C.,
Boston, Seattle and Baltimore.

Unless you comprehend the nature of
what is being asked of you, this country can't
possibly move through the next ten years in
a period of relative strength."

Compassion for pot
State should legalize recreational marijuana use
T hough medicinal marijuana in the state was made legal in
2008, the issue is still causing problems for patients who
have a prescription for the drug. On Aug. 25, 16 Michi-
gan residents were arrested in Oakland County and charged with
violating the state's medical marijuana act. This is yet another
example of the negative consequences of the state's still-ambig-
uous medicinal marijuana law. This law should be revised so that
patients who have been prescribed marijuana have an easy and
clear way to access the drug that they need. To further ease the
stigma related to use of the drug, the Michigan legislature should
simply completely legalize the recreational use of marijuana.

The Oakland County Sheriff's Narcotics
Enforcement Team made the arrests fol-
lowing raids at medical marijuana facilities
in Ferndale and Waterford. 16 people who
were arrested were charged in violation of
the medical marijuana act. According to
an Oct. 7 report by the Detroit Free Press,
Oakland County Sherriff Michael Boucha-
rd claims that drug abuse and dealing was
discovered at the sites by undercover police
officers, which prompted the raids. On Oct.
7, there was a hearing in Waterford to estab-
lish dates for upcoming hearings in Novem-
ber for 10 of the defendants. According to an
Oct. 8 article in The Detroit News, hundreds
of people gathered outside of a Waterford
District Court buildingto protest the charg-
es against the individuals.
One of the biggest areas of contention is
the compassion club targeted in the Water-
ford raid. Compassion clubs are areas in
which medical marijuana patients can inter-
act while they use the drug. Bouchard has
argued compassion clubs are illegal. But the
members of the compassion club who were
arrested were in adherence with reasonable
interpretations of the medicinal marijuana
law. In any other circumstance, there would
be no problem with people using a prescrip-
tion drug in the presence of others or groups
of people all using a properly prescribed

drug. And medical marijuana is a legal drug.
The state legislature should clean up this
vague, contradictory law.
The failure of the medical marijuana leg-
islation lies in part in the seeming unwill-
ingness of law enforcement to look at it as
a legal prescription drug. Many prescription
drugs - and some legal drugs, like alcohol
- can be abused. Yet, these drugs are gener-
ally granted acceptance by law enforcement
and the public. The Michigan legislature
needs to revise the law so that it isn't subject
to the interpretation of potentially biased
law enforcement officials.
Another, more easy way to solve the prob-
lems with current medical marijuana laws
would be to completely legalize marijuana
for recreational use. Beside the fact that
legalizing recreational marijuana use could
help to create anew industry inthe state and
aid the economy, the use of marijuana use is
a victimless crime. Like alcohol, marijuana
is only dangerous when residents don't fol-
low precautionary laws and choose to drive
under the influence.
Current medical marijuana laws are
incomplete and have led to injustice. The
state must now take action to repair the
laws. But to allow citizens to exercise their
personal freedoms, the use of recreational
marijuana should be legalized.

to about time that someone said
it. And as much as I would love
to take credit for what I think
is a rather clever
play on words, that
honor belongs to
a good friend of
mine who probably ,
didn't anticipate
that I would write
an entire column1
about one of his
status updates. But
as you can prob- NOEL
ably tell, his light- GORDON
hearted jab at the
now infamous "I
like it on the floor"
campaign captures just how frus-
trated I am with this annoying, albeit
well-intentioned, fad.
October is Breast Cancer Aware-
ness month. And according to the
National Cancer Institute, breast
cancer is the second-most common-
ly diagnosed type of cancer among
women in the United States. Approx-
imately 192,000 women and 2,000
men learn that they have it each year.
In Great Britain, the disease afflicts
46,000 women annually- the equiv-
alent of one person every 11 minutes.
These statistics prove that breast
cancer is a serious problem that
affects men and women around the
globe. And I think most people would
agree with me in saying that more
should be done to raise awareness
about its devastating effects. But sex-
ual innuendos are not the way to do
it. By effectively turning breast can-
cer into the butt of everyone's joke,
campaign organizers ran the risk of
losing their message. Sure, it might

be catchy. But catchy doesn't always
mean effective. So although "I like
it on the floor" might've been a good
idea in theory, I don't think it works
as well in practice.
Even if all 3,219 of your friends
update their statuses with places
they like it the most, it doesn't do
anyone a whole lot of good if only
200 of them actually understand the
reason for changing their status in
the first place. Arbitrary numbers
aside, I think that there could have
been a much better way to organize
the campaign so that it didn't come
across as just a bunch of hormonally
charged teenagers trying to one-up
each other.
The Human Rights Campaign, one
of America's most prominent LGBTQ-
affiliated organizations, developed an
effective strategy to successfully raise
awareness about the harms of bully-
ing and other issues facing the queer
community. On National Coming
Out Day, Facebook users were able to
update their statuses with pre-written
messages that read something to the
effect of:
"National Coming Out Day is
Tomorrow. It's 2010 and almost 90%
of LGBT youth experience harass-
ment in school, and too many lives
have been lost. Tell the Secretary of
Education to include gender identity
and sexual orientation in anti-bully-
ing programs."
Or: "____ is a straight ally and
National Coming Out Day is tomorrow.
I'm coming out for lesbian, gay, bisexu-
al and transgender equality because it's
2010 and almost 90% of LGBT youth
experience harassment in school, and
too many lives have been lost. Donate

your status and join me."
While those two options certainly
don't have the same punch to them
as "I like it on top of the washing
machine," it is nearly impossible to
misconstrue the point each one is
trying to make. And I think that's
where the 'I like it on the floor' cam-
paign fails miserably.
Viral campaigns
should be more
than just catchy.
Raising awareness about a par-
ticular issue is all well and good. But
it doesn't mean much if it isn't fol-
lowed up with some kind of action.
If I hadn't done any research for this
column, I probably never would have
known that there was an official web-
site for the "I like it on the floor" cam-
paign that not only explains the idea
behind the fad, but also connects visi-
tors with tons of ways to get actively
involved. I never would have found
out about this valuable resource had
I only read my roommate's status
update about how much he likes it on
top of a horse.
All in all, the "I like iton the floor"
campaign gets an A for effort. But
until it's orchestrated into something
a bit more cohesive and effective, I'd
like it off my newsfeed.

ROGER SAUERHAFT
Ill-timed 'You Suck' sucks

Perhaps I'm simply scapegoating after the
tough, depressing loss to our little brothers in
East Lansing, but I think someone really needs
to sit our school marching band director down
and explain to him how mind-numbingly stu-
pid he makes us all (and himself) look with the
"You Suck" chant.
I've been grumbling, if not venting, to my
friends for the past three years about how
angry it makes me when everyone around me
sings this on every fourth down even if the
opponent isn't punting. It doesn't take a foot-
ball mastermind to realize the irony when the
opposing team puts points on the board scarce-
ly seconds after the "You Suck" chant ends.
It's a crushing feeling when this happens on
the fourth down as I stand silent in the middle
of the student section wishing nobody would
pay attention to band director. The stupidity
embarrasses me each and every time.
Saturday was the worst of all. With just over
12 minutes left in the game, Michigan was
down 31 to 17 and Michigan State had the ball.
We absolutely couldn't let Michigan State score
again, but after they drove the ball downfield
to the 11-yard line, fourth down was reached
and Michigan State lined up for a short field
goal to cement the game's outcome. I knew our
chances to win were slim to none, but my only
hope was that everyone would have some com-
mon sense.
No such luck. Our band immediately led
our fans in a chorus letting Michigan State
know they sucked for having their drive stall
on fourth down and - right on cue - the ball
sailed through the uprights for the field goal.
Game, set, match.
A couple of Michigan State fans standing
near me enjoyed this spectacle greatly, snicker-
ing about the joke we'd justplayed on ourselves.
They saw me quietly brooding during the chant
and I think they felt bad for me. It was perhaps
my lowest moment at Michigan. And in case
that wasn't enough, the band director tried to
start the chant again after Michigan State ran
the ball up the middle three times to eat up the
clock. Thankfully, nobody followed the band's

lead this time. If they had, I would have sold
my remaining season tickets and never come
back to the Big House. Michigan State kept the
ball on a penalty anyway, so it's pretty clear
who got the last laugh.
Just imagine if we'd been in their shoes
with the East Lansing faithful chanting "you
suck" at us in the same situations in a game
during which we blew them out in their sta-
dium. There's no doubt in my mind that we'd
be laughing ourselves silly at their stupidity
and making our typical disparaging comments
about their academic standards.
To clarify my stance here, I support the "You
Suck" chant in situations where the opposing
offense isn't blatantly in a position to convert
on fourth down or kick a meaningful field-
goal. And yes, it's also bad to do it when the
other team is running down the clock late in
the fourth quarter to protect a huge lead (and
to avoid running up the score, which is an act
of sportsmanship). The chant is somewhat
funny, but it really isn't any more creative than
something a middle school Catholic Youth
organization basketball crowd could concoct.
It's certainly not at all classy. Yet, if the timing
reflected the intelligence of someone with an
IQ at least in double digits, I'd be all for it.
I'm not claiming any particular expertise in
the game of football, but something needs to
change, and it's really just the timing. If you're
going to tell someone something as unoriginal
and classless as "you suck," it has to be done
selectively. It's hard to endorse a chant so class-
less and pointless. But if I do, I'd rather not look
like a complete fool in the process.
My family and I are deeply rooted in Michi-
gan tradition, and this bothers me a great deal
because it makes a mockery of Michigan. It
makes us look stupid, and I'm proud to say this
isn't something I'm used to feeling about my
school. It's bad whether we win or lose - and
when we do lose, it's salt in our own wound.
There needs to be change immediately here
and it's all timing, timing, timing.

A passive generation

The 1960s - a decade heavily shaped by the Vietnam
War - was a period of time at the University that sparked
rage and revolt on campus. The experience of the students
that matriculated through the University duringthose 10
years was marked by the war and its overall effect on the
country. Exactly 50 years later, in the midst of yet another
war, it seems our campus is immune to what's going on
outside of Ann Arbor's city limits.
About two years ago, right after returning from
Thanksgiving break, I met a friend for dinner. I began to
discuss the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India - a three-
day affair that gripped the globe until the captives were
safely rescued. My break was consumed by discussion of
the attacks. Every newspaper I read or television network
I watched covered the conflict. But my friend had no idea
what I was talking about. I explained the situation with a
slight sense of horror at her naivete.
Our generation exists in a society that is constantly
surrounded by technology. And yet, we seem to have a
disconnected wire from the realities of the real world.
Students walk around campus on their iPods or Blackber-
rys, engrossed in the superficial world held in their hands.
And while I have no doubt that they are using the devices
for productive purposes, they take what they learn and
store it in their brain and continue on their way. Never on
campus do you hear about a protest against this dragged-
out war on terror the likes of which you would have seen
in the 1960s. Or the genocide occurring in Darfur. Our
generation, followingsuch a proactive one, is surprisingly
passive.
Today and tomorrow, we commemorate the 50th anni-
versary of the creation of the Peace Corps - a volunteer
organization that sends citizens to worn and torn coun-
tries in an attempt to help repair the damage. Then-pres-
idential candidate John F. Kennedy first announced the
concept of a Peace Corps-type organization during a late
night address on the steps of the Michigan Union.

That speech almost didn't occur. Kennedy was running
late that evening and told his advisors to cancel the event.
But the advisors disputed his decision. They informed
Kennedy that the students were so eager to hear him
and that they were so desperate to support him that he
must show up. Around 2 a.m., the presidential candidate
arrived inAnn Arbor to finda sea of students surrounding
the Union.
In my three years at the University, I have only once
seen a similar passion - November 4, 2008, on the night
that Barack Obama was elected president. In the two and
a half years since Obama was elected, many events have
occurred worthy of students' attention. And with a cru-
cial election for the state of Michigan quickly approach-
ing, it's essential that our generation rallies the troops on
the Union steps (pun intended) to support a cause or a
candidate.
Many students spend their summers working on Capi-
tol Hill or at large banks, witnessing our society's prob-
lems from an internal view. We have the opportunities to
intern for senators and read proposed bills on their way to
Congress or work on Wall Street and observe the effects
of the economy's downward spiral and attempted repair.
But when summer ends and we return to Ann Arbor, our
exposure and impact diminish. Influence doesn't have
to be contingent on location. Students need to maintain
those ties and remember those issues when they are at
school and apply them to their classwork and lifestyle.
In honor of the anniversary of this historic affair and
in recognition of a pivotal race for governor heating up,
I encourage each of us to take a stance on an important
issue affecting our generation and create new memora-
ble events. Whether it pertains to political office or eco-
friendly cups in the cafeteria, we all need to find an issue
to become more passionate about.

Officials to e-mail campus

about file sharing

New federal law
mandates 'U' send
e-mail once a year on
illegal file sharing
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
University officials are final-
izing plans to send out an e-mail
notice to all students, faculty and
staff tomorrow to warn against
the dangers of peer-to-peer file
sharing.
The mass e-mail is being sent
to all members of the University
community because of a new law
that went into effect this sum-
mer. University officials have
stressed that the law is the only
reason for the e-mail and that it
is not meant to target any indi-
vidual for activities they may, or
may not, take part in.
The Higher Education Oppor-
SERVICEWORLD
From Page 1A
Peace Corps circulated half a cen-
tury ago.
ServiceWorld's declaration is
available for students and others
to sign online and on campus this
week, and highlights the value of
international service. The petition
states, among other things, that
the signer is "ready to serve and
support ServiceWorld's bold agen-
da to expand volunteer opportuni-
ties for individuals internationally
... to learn about global problems
and help find more effective ways
to solve them."
Sibley, who is currently in Ann
Arbor to help with ServiceWorld's
part in the University's Peace
Corps 50th anniversary celebra-
tion, said the organization's main
objective is to increase the number
of Americans volunteering abroad

tunity Act requires the Univer-
sity to send an e-mail message to
members of the University com-
munity at least once a year to
provide information about illegal
file sharing and copyright viola-
tions. The law also mandates
that colleges include three pieces
of information in their communi-
cation to students, staff and fac-
ulty.
First, the law requires the Uni-
versity to warn about the penal-
ties - both civil and criminal
- that could result from illegal
file sharing. Additionally, the
University must include a sum-
mary of what those penalties
could include and provide infor-
mation about its policies regard-
ing copyright infringement and
illegal file sharing.
A standard form is available
for postsecondary institutions
to use in crafting their annual
notice. But in an interview last
week, Jack Bernard, an assistant
general counsel for the Univer-
each year. The ServiceWorld pro-
gram sends volunteers to work on
a variety of issues including health,
agriculture, women's rights, the
environment and education.
"Our goal is to see the U.S. send
100,000 American volunteers
abroad each year," Sibley said in a
phone interview.
ServiceWorld's plan, accord-
ing to Sibley, consists of four main
efforts to increase volunteer par-
ticipation abroad and to strengthen
America's international relations.
These efforts include doublingthe
number of participants in the Peace
Corps, expanding the Volunteers for
Prosperity program, creating short-
er-duration service fellowships and
establishing an international social
innovation fund.
In a promotional video, the
organization said that if it achieves
these ambitious aspirations, it can
reach its goal of sending 100,000
volunteers abroad from a plethora

dangers
sity, said the University decided
to craft its own unique message.
"Our objectives are really edu-
cational," Bernard said, explain-
ing that University officials
didn't want to be seen as target-
ing any specific members of the
campus community.
"This notice is just a federal
requirement and it is not maaking
any assertions whatsoever about
the individuals who receive
it," Bernard said in a statement
issued earlier this week.
However, University officials
have every intention to do what-
ever is necessary to comply with
the Higher Education Opportu-
nity Act, since federal funding
could be stripped if the Univer-
sity fails to comply with it.
"The HEOA makes all federal
funding to an institution contin-
gent on its good-faith compliance
with the HEOA, which is why the
University is sending this mes-
sage to all its constituents," Ber-
nard said in the same statement.
of different programs.
"Fifty years ago the only real
way for volunteers to go abroad
was through the Peace Corps," Sib-
ley said. "Now many, many multi-
national corporations are involved."
Representatives for Service-
World will be promoting the dec-
laration at various Peace Corps
anniversary events, including the
national and student symposiums
on Oct. 13 and 14 as well as during
tonight's 2 a.m. celebration on the
Michigan Union steps that aims to
celebrate Kennedy's original call to
students. ServiceWorld's declara-
tion is also available on its website.
"It's a call for expansion and a
new strategy of international ser-
vice," Sibley said. "We really want
to get individuals to sign support-
ing the agenda to send more people
abroad each year. It's a better way
ofshowing the world the American
people. It's a great diplomatic way
to do it."


CHINA

establish collaborative research
efforts, to cultivate exchanges of
faculty, medical residents, fellows
and other researchers, and to com-
plete large scale clinical trials and
other kinds of research - all in the
pursuit of discovering new ways to
prevent, treat and cure pulmonary,
cardiac and liver diseases," Pesco-
vitz said.
However, her comments quickly
shifted to defending the University
Medical School's broader ties to
Chinese universities.
"If we want to fulfill the Univer-
sity of Michigan Medical School's
vision of creating the future of
medicine - if we want to become
a leader in global medicine - we
must deepen our understanding of
disease and its impact, not only on
individuals and communities, but
on nations worldwide," Pescovitz
said. "And to do that successfully,
we must invite global perspectives, .
we must invite global ideas into our
laboratories and into our offices." .
Pescovitz told the members of
the audience gathered in the Bio-
medical Science Research Building
auditorium that not only will col-
laboration help advance the work
of UMHS in the future, but it has
already helped position UMHS as
CLINIC
From Page 1A
advise, and we can .provide aca-
demic materials."
Students working at the clinic
will have an opportunity to both
learn about and advocate for the
rights of victims of human traf-
ficking. As defined by the Office
to Monitor and Combat Traffick-
ing in Persons, human trafficking
includes "the activities involved
when someone obtains or holds a
person in compelled service" like
forced labor, debt bondage, sex
trafficking or involuntary domes-
tic servitude.
Zacatecas was chosen as the site

a world-class system.
"I cannot think of one thing that
we do or one success that we have
had as a University or as a health
system that doesn't require team-
work or collaboration," Pescovitz
said.
She went on to say that expand-
ing University collaborations to
Chinese universities is a logical
step because of deep partnerships
already in place with institutions
in the country.
"What better place to start with
than in China?" Pescovitz said.
"After all, China is a country with
which we already have a long-
standing and successful series of
relationships."
Pescovitz went on to detail the
statistics of the University Medical
School's partnerships in China.
"To date our medical school has
19 departments that already are
engaged in active collaborations
with 31 different Chinese univer-
sities," she said, adding that the
Medical School has co-authored
more articles with Chinese
researchers than with researchers
in any other country.
"This rich history and strong
foundation make China a natural
choice for the next generation of
collaborative discovery, and we
feel so extraordinarily fortunate to
have found the perfect partner in
Peking University Health Science

Center," Pescovitz said.
However, not all in attendance
were as supportive of the Univer-
sity's relationships with Chinese
universities.
Though no demonstrations
were made during the event, some
who have advocated for a more
limited relationship with Chinese
institutions were in attendance
and stayed after the event as offi-
cials stood for photographs.
Pre-empting any sort of scene
that protestors may have other-
wise made, a UMHS communica-
tions employee read a statement on
freedom of speech at the beginning
of the event.
"The University of Michigan
strives to create a truly open forum,
one in which diverse opinions
can be expressed and heard," the
employee told the audience. "Pro-
testors must not interfere unduly
with communication between the
speaker or artist and members of
the audience."
She continued: "If the host of
this event or an University rep-
resentative believe a protestor
is interfering unduly with the
speaker or performer's freedom of
expression, those protestors will
be warned. If the warnings are
not heeded and the interference
continues, then the individuals
responsible may be removed from
the building."

for the future clinic in part because
the University's Law School has
worked with Centro de los Derechos
del Migrante in the past. Details of
the project are still being discussed,
and it has not yet been determined
when the group will travel to Mex-
ico or how long it will take to set up
the new clinic, Weill said.
Ideally, the students and fac-
ulty will raise awareness of human
trafficking problems in the area,
train local private attorneys to rec-
ognize specific examples and teach
them how to take action, she said.
Since laws addressing human
trafficking are relatively recent,
many within the legal commu-
nity are not aware of their specific
implications. Because of this, Weill

said, educating upcoming lawyers
on this issue is important.
"A lot of times,.because the law
is so new, people who have been
in practice for a while don't know
much about how it works - they
don't have training in trafficking
law," Weill said.
According to Weill, clinics like
the one at the University allow law
students to work under licensed
faculty members on actual cases,
thus gaining practical experience
in the field. They generally accept
clients who can't afford a private
attorney or cases that private
attorneys would not accept for eco-
nomic reasons.
"They fill a need that isn't being
addressed," she said.


HOUSING
From Page 1A
create an atmosphere of acceptance
on campus. If the policy is imple-
mented, students who choose the
open housing option residence halls
would be able to choose a room-
mate of any gender.
"It's good for the campus com-
munity because it respects stu-
dents' freedoms and rights," Horky
said. "Implicit in this initiative is
that we believe that students have
the right and freedom to choose
how they live."
Though both the Residence
Halls Association and MSA passed
resolutions supporting open hous-
ing, plans to incorporate the new
housing option have yet to go into
effect in any residence halls.

Horky said that the Open Hous-
ing Initiative's report to residence
hall administrators will be a key
step in implementing the housing
on campus.
"Ultimately, if housing is going
to be supportive, then the other
administrators will respect that
and also support the change,"
Horky said. "We hope to have
it available for students that are
returning to housing this coming
year. The following year itwould be
ideal if first-year students coming
into the system could use it, so that
would be fall 2012."
According to Horky, the Open
Housing Initiative has been work-
ing to spread awareness of the
option on campus.
"We're trying to focus on res.
halls specifically" she said. "We're
doing panels in the res. halls, were

doing bulletin boards for the RAs.
We're doing flyers, and all that kind
of thing."
Open Housing Initiative repre-
sentatives will also be distribut-
ing flyers and answering questions
about the option on the Diag on
Oct. 28. MSA President Chris Arm-
strong, who ran his campaign for
MSA president partly on imple-
menting an open housing option,
said in an interview last night that
he is optimistic about the future of
the initiative.
"I think that as I've mentioned
before, it's really been an initiative
that has gained momentum," Arm-
strong said. "I think that it's some-
thing that a lot of students really
care about."

Ass't medical prof. says most of his
chronic pain patients using weed

From Page 1A
he or she has one of the "debilita-
tion medical conditions" specified
in the state law. The list includes
cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS,
Crohn's disease, Alzheimer's
disease. In addition, the various
symptoms of chronic or debilitat-
ing conditions are also included,
like severe or chronic pain, severe
nausea or wasting syndrome -
significant weight loss caused by
the AIDS virus or chronic fever
and diarrhea.
Dr. Daniel Berland, an assistant
professor of internal medicine and
anesthesiology at the University's
Medical School, treats patients
with acute and chronic pain at the
University Hospital. He said most
of his patients who go to the hospi-
tal for chronic pain are either using
marijuana or asking for it, which is
a "drastic change" from just a year
ago.
Dr. James Riddell IV, an associ-
ate professor of internal medicine
in the Medical School and an infec-
tious disease specialist at the Uni-
versity Hospital who works with
HIV/AIDS patients, said some doc-
tors refuse to recognize marijuana
as a treatment option, while others
not affiliated with the University
hand out written certifications for
their patients "willy nilly." He esti-
mated that about 25 percent of doc-
tors, like him, generally supportthe
possibility that marijuana has med-
ical benefits but want to see more
scientific evidence.
"You get varying attitudes, and
I think in general, physicians are
sort of a conservative bunch and in
general what we like to see before
we endorse any treatment is data,"
he said, adding that he has provided

written certifications to a "select
number" of his patients.
The law only gives a general list
of qualifying conditions. To help
physicians in the state, Riddell was
one of nine doctors at the Univer-
sity who put together a comprehen-
sive guide last March that details
how marijuana reportedly affects
patients with each qualifying con-
dition.
The guide - based on findings
from previous studies on the drug
- explains that there are more
effective medications for treating
each condition. Doctors also agree
that until more research is done,
marijuana should be used as a last
resort and only after other treat-
ments have failed.
Berland, who has never provided
a written certification for a patient,
said the scientific evidence behind
the medical benefits of marijuana
is simply not substantial enough
to merit the drug as a treatment
option. The research that is avail-
able, he said, consistently shows
that other proven treatments work
better and are often cheaper than
marijuana. For pain relief, marijua-
na is about as effective as Tylenol
with codeine, he said.
"We all want to have a bias that
this drugcould be useful, and many
of us have a bias that it should be
decriminalized," Berland said.
"The long and the short of it is
the scientific evidence is limited
to non-existent, and so therefore,
most (doctors) probably practice by
scientific evidence and are not giv-
ing it."
Mike Meno, director of commu-
nications for the Marijuana Policy
Project - the organization respon-
sible for drafting Michigan's medi-
cal marijuana law - said marijuana

is perhaps one of the most studied
plants of all time. The "myth" that
there is a lack of research on the
plant exists because none of the
research has been supported by the
federal government, he explained.
"While all these studies have
been going on in the United States
and other countries, the fed-
eral government for years has
actively blocked much needed
(United States Food and Drug
Administration) level research that
would allow marijuana to move
through the FDA approval pro-
cess," Meno said.
The reason there hasn't been
research done on the federal level,
he added, is because marijuana is
held to a "ridiculous standard."
The Drug Enforcement Agency
classifies marijuana, along with
GHB, heroin and LSD, as a schedule
I drug under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act. Schedule I is the most
restrictive out of the five drug clas-
sifications listed under the act. The
category consists of drugs that have
a high potential for abuse and no
accepted medical use in the United
States. In 2001, the DEA denied a
petition to make marijuana a less
restricted classification, citing its
lack of medical use as the primary
reason.
Meno disagrees with the DEA's
decision and said several studies
confirm marijuana's safety and
medicinal properties.
"It's a blatant lie for the federal
government to say (marijuana) has
no medical efficacy," Meno said.
"There are patients who are ben-
efiting from it right now."
One popular study published
in 1999 by the National Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Medicine
reported that cannabinoid drugs

have a "therapeuticvalue" for "pain
relief, control of nausea and vomit-
ing and appetite stimulation." The
study also highlights the poten-
tial value of marijuana's positive
psychological effects on certain
patients. Like many scientific stud-
ies, the report asserted a need for
further research.
Official reports aside, many
patients who have turned to mari-
juana swear by its benefits.
Chuck Ream, a prominent local
medical marijuana advocate from
Scio Township, Mich. has suf-
fered from a debilitating stomach
condition since the 1960s. He said
marijuana helped him turn his life
around when his condition was at
its worst.
"I think (marijuana) saved my
life. I would've probably killed
myself just because I simply
couldn't get control of this," he
said. "I would get up in the morn-
ing, driven out of bed by pain, and
I would eat baby food out of the
can, out of the jar, and I would
get down in the fetal position and
rock back and forth for most of
the day, and it kept getting worse,
not better."
Ream, one of the founders of
MedMar Compassionate Health-
care - a non-profit organization on
Packard Street in Ann Arbor where
registered patients can purchase
marijuana products - said there
are other medications that work
well for him, but he still feels mari-
juana has a place in his treatment
regime.
"Cannabis is just part of my
healthy program," he said, "and I
can tell when smoking a joint would
really help me a lot, and I can tell
other times when it's not smoking a
joint I need."

TLC fumbles 'Kick Off

By BRIANNE JOHNSON

A pinch of melodramatic sus-

drama. No, not Cook Off
"The Hills" - it's Thursdays

of pre-game cuisine and hearty

obvious attempt to lure the male
demographic (because "Say Yes to

entirely.
Surrounded by yards of green,
the contestants are challenged
to fire up their grills and create
the ultimate fan's food. Three
teams sprint for the $1,000 prize
as they cook through various
stages of meals, judged by res-

reporter Erin Andrews as host.

Indie superstar
returns, but without
his signature style
By EMMA GASE
Daily Arts Writer
After five long years of silence,
with only the occasional tantaliz-
ing collaboration
or side project,
Sufjan Stevens
bestows upon the $u an
musical world
his first official Stevens
full-length LP The AgeofAdz
since. 2005's Illi-A
nois. Huzzah! AshmaicKity
Though Age of
Adz is coming right off the heels
of Steven's behemoth of an EP, the
hour-long AllDelighted People, this
is still cause for celebration.
Adz is a bold move, to say the
least. Fans salivating for more
quaint, meticulously composed
ballads ("Decatur," "Casimir
Pulaski Day") or swelling, oth-
erworldly anthems ("Chicago")
should readjust their expectations.
No strategically placed banjos or
tasteful accordions are found here.
Don't be fooled by album
opener "Futile Devices." Sufjan
deceives listeners with a sig-
nature two-minute folksy treat
showcasing his angelic falsetto
akin to Illinois's "John Wayne
Gacy, Jr." The poignantly over-
lapped finger-picked acoustic and
electric guitars form the founda-
tion of the song. Stevens' subtle
addition of piano, picked violin
and reverb make an otherwise
simple folk song into something of
quiet majestic beauty.
"Too Much" is more indicative
of the album's sound. It begins in
a jarring blur of strange sounds
akin to an upset stomach (or the
Flaming Lips circa Yoshimi).
once the odd gurgling subsides,
it transforms into an electronic
hip-hop beat that Stevens sings
over in a jaunty up-tilt. Standard
Sufjan horns permeate the mid-

Madz Men - Cowing soon to AMZ.
dIe of the song, but soon listen-
ers are back into WTF territory.
Out of nowhere, the song morphs
into something that would suit a
James Bond chase scene complete
with iflutes and strings. How did
this melodic song become a high-
intensity, instrumental hot mess of
ominous urgency a'la "Live and Let
Die?" Or, more importantly, why?
The opening orchestral notes of
the title track are in this same vein.
"Age of Adz" sounds more like the
score to a horror movie when the
main character first discovers the
psycho axe murderer than a Sufjan
Stevens song. The chorus provides
a welcome foray into melodic ter-
ritory when Stevens strains "This
is the Age of Adz / Eternal living
/ When it dies, when it dies / It
rots." Archetypal Stevens horns
add jazzy flavor to cushion the
depressing lyrics.
After listening to Age of Adz's
drum machines and spacey elec-
tronica amblings devoid of any
semblance of verse-chorus-verse,
one may wonder why someone like
Stevens, who so obviously has a

God-given gift for melody, would
choose to divorce himself from
a model that allows maximum
appreciation of that gift.
The album is dripping withbold
risks and brilliance, but has only
brisk flashes of effortlessly enjoy-
able listening. It is not easy to love
the songs like it was on Illinois.
Look for easy tuneful pleasure
elsewhere.
Age ofAdzrequires patience and
an educated ear. Few things will
draw you in; the lyrics are desolate
and extremely personal, the songs
stretch from seven to 25 minutes,
often with lengthy instrumental
interludes. Though most signs
point to self-indulgence, somehow
Stevens shirks that notion almost
entirely. Perhaps because he slips
in enough melodic genius to dis-
tract us from the abrasive electron-
ic beats and peculiar intermittent
sonics, we forgive him the same
way we forgive a band for notplay-
ing our favorite song until the very
last encore. Because in the end,
like Age ofAdz, it turned out to be
worth the wait.

TV REVIEW
Cartman's capers
South Park, season 14
Wednesdays at10 p.m.
Comedy Central
After a five-month hiatus that
felt much longer, "South Park" is
back with the second half of its 14th
season. In recent years, episodes
have tended to be hit or miss. Fortu-
nately, this was a definite hit - and
hopefully a sign of hits to come.
Stan and Kyle find Cartman cry-
ing over his realization that he'll

never achieve his lifelong dream:
becoming a NASCAR driver, appar-
ently. The only thing stopping him
is that he's not "poor and stupid
enough." But Cartman sets out to
make his dream a reality, ingesting
Vagisil to induce short term memo-
ry loss, adopting a redneck accent
and even running over Danica Pat-
rick, along with many spectators on
the racetrack.
"South Park" has always tried
to tackle real-life issues - such as
Facebook and HIV - in its own
comedic way. But often, there was
an integral piece missing to those
lofty episodes: Cartman. Many
of the fanbase's favorite episodes
revolve solely around Cartman and
his debacles (Scott Tenorman, any-

one?). When Cartman doesn't take
a lead role in an episode, something
just doesn't feel right. Watching
him act like the stereotypical red-
neck is testament to Cartman's abil-
ity to make "South Park." He might
be one of the most racist, disgusting
and immoral characters on televi-
sion,butyou can't help but love him.
It's great to see Cartman finally
return to the spotlight of "South
Park," and when he stays there,
there is little reason to believe the
episode will be anything short of
successful. Though the show is not
completely dependent upon Cart-
man's edgy antics, we can only hope
he stays the central character this
season.

Even though he's a freshman,
Banks and Van Bergen have give-

When Banks was a freshman,
Shawn Crable liked his stab pass-

himself. There were no secrets -
everyone's on the same team.
Over the past few weeks, the
defensive line has put pressure on

"I definitely feel like we're get-

said. "We're gelling pretty well. We

Bringing in Black on third

Wolverines can throw at oppos-

A PEACEFUL REALIZATION
BY JER EMY BOROVITZ

I t was toward the beginning of my
senior year, wedged in between a
pair of football losses. After com-
ng back from a semester abroad in
Warsaw, Poland, I had been feeling just
a bit more lost than usual, and it sort of
culminated on that da.
Not that I could remember ever
really knowing where I was going. In
fact, ever since Professor H.D. Cam-
eron began spouting quotes of Homeric
proportions in my very first college
lecture, I realized that I had very little
endgame in mind. But there I was, just
months removed from this transforma-
tive, worldly experience and, suddenly,
6 a.m. pre-games and Thursday nights
at Skeeps no longer seemed sufficient
distractions.
I was wandering the streets of cam-
pus that Sunday, crossing under the

Engineering arch, giving some spare
change to one of our more jovial,
friendly bums. I hummed along to the
harmonica that ushered my entrance
to the diag and I exchanged pleasant-
ries with friends fighting hangovers on
their way to the UGLi.
I approached that Gold 'M' in the
center, that grand piece of maize metal
on the ground that I refused to step on
- a stance that I would hold fast until
graduation. I suddenly recalled the
chubby 16-year-old who first visited
this campus, who first trembled at its
buildings, who first whiffed the aroma
of tradition in the air. I remembered
this boy, and I had to wonder: Has any-
thing changed?
I had made great friends in col-
lege, sure. I had met some girls and I
had hurt some girls. I had gotten hurt

enough that I saw the ground before
me but not the sky or the buildings or
the future straight ahead. My legs were
Staking me somewhere, and my choices
were taking me somewhere - some-
where my head and heart would soon
follow.
I found myself on the steps of the
Union, the University's flag flying high
from its tower. I stared again at the
plaque I had seen a million times: John

would find myself yearning for my for-
mer dilapidated residence on Vaughn
Street.
I still do a lot of wandering here -
wading through fields of sunflowers or
rowrs of potatoes or forests of wheat.
But now I wander with purpose, trying
to figure out a theme for my next Eng-
lish lesson or how to better implement
our village-wide anti-litter campaign. I
strategize with local leaders about hosr
to build a better future for the children,
and I brainstorm about financing for
my pipe dream of a recycling plant in
the abandoned factory just outside of
town.

school and ask me about the flag with
the giant 'M' draped on my wall. I tell
them it's from the greatest University

PAY FOR PLAY
From Page 5
for-play opponents who claim there
would be no fair way to pay student-
athletes.
"It's not more for a skill position,
less for a lineman, more for an offen-
sive player, less for a defensive play-
er," he said. "They're all in it together.
And whether they ride the bench
or ride the shoulders as conquering
heroes after the game, they all get
paid the same amount."
Chambers and Winfree are just
two individuals who are sympathetic
to the idea of paying student-athletes.
But their contrasting approaches to

the fundamental mechanics of doing
so highlight perhaps the biggest chal-
lenge faced by pay-for-play advocates:
Even if society could be convinced
that compensation beyond scholar-
ships for revenue athletes was the
right thing to do, the practical impli-
cations are daunting.
"The financial structure of higher
education today and college athlet-
ics, it's not there without a significant
subsidy from the university or the
cutting of other sports to pay for it,"
Martin said.
In a January 2008 Sports Illustrat-
ed column, long-time sports commen-
tator Frank Deford asserted that the
revenue programs subsidizing other
sports is part of the problem, noting

that the football and basketball ath-
letes come from disproportionately
poor African-American backgrounds.
"Not only do poor black kids get
no remuneration for their work, they
are expected to carry all these other
coaches and players and teams on
their backs with their unpaid labor,"
Deford wrote. "Basically, a scholar-
ship boils down to a device to keep
the players on the premises where
they can perform their services for
free."
Veteran columnist Jason Whit-
lock took it one step further last July,
writing that "Reggie Bush is Kunta
Kinte, a runaway slave," in a piece for
FoxSports.com.
Obviously, comparing NCAA ath-

letics to slavery is just inflammatory.
But while they're certainly not paid
professionals, they're not pure ama-
teurs either, as the NCAA contends.
"There's no question that there's
commercialization," Martin said.
"There's no question that college
coaches, the head coaches, the coor-
dinators at our level make signifi-
cant income. There's just no question
about it."
Former UCLA basketball star Ed
O'Bannon and former Nebraska and
Arizona State quarterback Sam Keller
are leading a class action lawsuit in
federal courts on behalf of current
and former athletes to try and make
the NCAA share revenues earned
through the licensing of players' like-

nesses with the athletes.
They have had success beyond
similar past challenges in the prelim-
inary stages, according to The Asso-
ciated Press. History says it's a long
shot, but a victory for O'Bannon and
Keller would lead to a reckoning in an
entire industry - an industry fiercely
resistant to this kind of change.
"Higher education is clinging to
amateur athletics," Martin said.
Why?
He paused. "That's a good ques-
tion. Because I think people would
like the world to maybe stop. That
they'd like for there to be the concept
of amateurism as we grew up with it
to remain in effect. Now maybe as we
get older in time, that will change."

WHY COLLEGES SHOULD,
PROBABL CN'T, AND
MOST LIKELY WON'T
PAY STUDENT-ATHLETES.

dinner and passionately discussed
the impact that student participa-
tion abroad could have in developing
countries. On a whim, they wrote
a note on a napkin to then editor in
chief of The Michigan Daily, Tom
Hayden, emphasizingthe importance
of student participation abroad.
The Guskins dropped the note off
at the newsroom, and the Daily pub-
lished it on October 19th, 1960. The
note asked students to send letters to
the Daily or the Guskins articulating
support for an international aid pro-
gram that they would in turn send to
Kennedy and Bowles.
"If it is at all possible, we would
like students to start asking others
in their classes, dorms, sororities,
fraternities, houses, etc. to send let-
ters expressing their desire to work
toward these goals," the letter read.
"With this request we express our
faith that those of us who have been
fortunate enough to receive an edu-
cation will want to apply their knowl-
edge through direct participation in
the under developed communities of
the world."
Almost instantaneously, the
Guskins were flooded with letters
and telephone calls from students
voicing support for such a program.
In response to such widespread sup-
port, the Guskins drafted petitions
and urged students and faculty mem-
bers around campus to sign them.
"It just took off like wildfire," Al
Guskin said.
Shortly after, the Guskins received
a call from Kennedy's campaign
manager telling them that the sena-
tor wanted to meet with them at the
Toledo Airport on Nov. 3. The next
day, the Guskins were off to Toledo to
discuss the project.
"I gave him the petitions and he
looked into my eyes," Judy Guskin
said excitedly in a recent interview
with the Daily. "He was a big guy,
this big tall man that came to me, and
with very large hands. That's what I
remember. And he listened, he really
was attentive."
"I was really impressed with the
fact that all he wanted to do was say
hello to us and meet us," Al Guskin
said. "He wasn't interested in mak-
ing any big deal for the press about
it, and it was kind of fun. We talked
for a little bit, he teased us a little bit.
He asked us if he could take the peti-
tions."
The Guskins were hesitant about
what would happen next. They were
worried that Kennedy wasn't truly
interested in developing the pro-
gram, or even if it would be feasible.
In response, Kennedy assuredly told
them that after Election Day, the
Peace Corps would be his main focus.
"Until Tuesday, the election. After
that, the world," Al Guskin remem-
bers Kennedy told them.

community."
Privacy also became somewhat
challenging for Guild. As the only
American in her community, she
generated a strong sense of curios-
ity among locals. Since she was con-
stantly being monitored, Guild had
to exude a happy exterior at all times
and restrict her emotions to not
frighten locals, something she found
draining at times.
"You're constantly in people's view
and they know where you are at all
times because you're unique and dif-
ferent in the community," Guild said.
"It's difficult to adjust to the fact that
you're such an anomaly and that you
don't have as much privacy as you
would in the States."
Despite this, she rose above these
challenges, eventually acclimated to
the culture and soon felt as if she was a
true part of the community. The town
treated her like she belonged, and she
soon developed lasting friendships
and relationships that made her feel
truly comfortable in Guatemala.
"They really took me in as one of
their own," Guild said. "I felt really
safe, I had friends. It's a unique expe-
rience that you don't get when you
just travel to a country and that takes
a long time to establish. And the fact

that I was just able to meant so much
to me."
Al Guskin said last week that even
at 73 years old, he automatically feels
a bond with young students recently
coming out of the program.
"I meet with them and there's a
bond immediately because we had
this powerful experience," Al said.
"I'll meet a returned Peace Corps vol-
unteer who's 30 years and we start
talking about our experience. It's a
powerful experience that changes
people's lives. We gain much more
than we give. We really gain so
much."
Both the Guskins will be in Ann
Arbor to celebrate the 50th anniver-
sary of Kennedy's speech and to be
present at the various programs in
honor of the Peace Corps and their
contribution.
To Judy, the anniversary has
allowed her to delve into her past and
remember the moments that enriched
and forever transformed her life.
"Basically I'm reliving wonderful
days," Judy said. "Thinking about my
students, thinking about Ann Arbor.
And that's what this is giving me an
opportunity to do."

than two months.


At 4:15 a.m. ona summer morn-
ing in Guatemala, Alexis
Guild stumbles out of bed and
makes her way to the coffee maker
for a fresh pot of java. Quickly dress-
ing, she gathers her things and heads
to the Capitol Building, where at 5
a.m. a bus waits to take her on a two-
hour ride through the mountainous
Guatemalan countryside.
When she arrives at her destina-
tion - a Guatemalan primary school
- a class.of young students wait for
her to teach them their daily health
education lesson. Today, Guild
emphasizes the importance of hand
washing and teeth brushing and
demonstrates the correct methods
for each.
After teaching the students from

7 a.m. to 1 p.m., Guild takes a bus
back to town with her colleagues,
where she talks with locals and buys
groceries in small stores nearby. She
finally retires to her adobe house
and bathes in a small stone basin,
using water she saved before the dry
spell that left her town waterless for
days.
This was a typical day for Guild,
a former Peace Corps volunteer and
current University graduate student,
during her service in Guatemala.
After graduating with a bachelor's
degree in comparative literature
from Wellesley College in 2003, she
worked for a reproductive health
organization in Maryland before
helping with political campaigns for
U.S. and state senators in the 2004

and 2006 elections.
But throughout the duration of
her post-grad work, she longed for
something more. After spending
time abroad in college and hear-
ing stories from friends who had
recently returned from mission trips
in other countries, Guild knew she
wanted to venture outside the coun-
try and be a part of something life
changing. So she decided to apply to
the Peace Corps.
Guild was accepted and was sent
to Guatemala in April 2007. Her mis-
sion was to help implement healthy
lifestyles and teach health education
to students in primary schools in the
area. She also engaged in infrastruc-
ture projects to increase the avail-
ability of running water so locals

could engage in hygienic behavior,
and worked on secondary programs
that involved HIV/AIDS education
and teaching English as a second
language.
Guild's experiences in Guatemala
would not have been possible, how-
ever, without the help of the Uni-
versity of Michigan students of the
1960's. Inspired by John F. Kenne-
dy's speech on the Michigan Union
steps on October 14, 1960, two stu-
dents in particular played integral
roles in the formation of the Peace
Corps.
Al and Judy Guskin, a young mar-
ried couple in graduate school, were
among the hundreds of students on

the steps of the Michigan Union at
2 a.m. listening to Senator Kenne-
dy's speech. At that time, they had
no idea that they would soon play a
pivotal role in propelling the Peace
Corps movement into action.
"We were excited that Kennedy
was sayingthat we had some respon-
sibility for peace and for things that
were important in the world and
that we had some ability to make a

ollege athletics and school
spirit are among the most cher-
ished of American traditions.
But college sports in the
United States are unique in their appeal,
both in relation to the rest of the world,
which does not share our obsession, and
to other forms of entertainment. We
pay to see Oscar-caliber actors at the
movies, not theater-school novices. We
wait in long lines for Bruce Springsteen
concerts, not high school battles of the
bands. Yet you'll rarely find a fan of the
NBA or the NFL who dismisses college
basketball and college football as trifling
or insignificant.
So why don't we regard the win-
ners of the BCS Championship and the
NCAA tournament as merely big fish in
small ponds? What's the source of our
enthusiasm for college sports that minor
league baseball teams would kill for?
The answer dates back to the incep-
tion of intercollegiate competition, and
it comes down to one word: amateurism.
Popular American sentiment holds a
special place for the amateur ideal - we
adore the concept of student-athletes
who are students first, who wear their
school colors, who share a special con-
nection with their fan bases composed
primarily oftheir classmates and alumni
and who learn life lessons about team-
work and discipline while also working
toward a college degree.

Above all, the conventional wisdom
tells us, student-athletes are spared the
temptations of huge paychecks. We find
it wholesome that they walk away with
only an education. Even if it's just at a
subconscious level, these factors bring
charm and an innocence to college
sports that is absent in the professional
realm.
We cry foul when a college athlete is
caught taking cash or other perks from
a shady character with close ties to the
athletic department. We condemn for-
mer USC running back Reggie Bush for
taking gifts from agents, revoking his
distinction as the 2005 Heisman Trophy
winner. After all, making money isn't
what college sports are about.
At the same time, we eagery spend on
tickets, t-shirts and bumper stickers. We
tune in on Saturdays and lend our cap-
tive eyes to television advertisers who
paybigbucks tobe sandwiched between
coverage of young hot shots like Denard
Robinson taking snaps while serving as
walking (and running, and throwing)
promotions for ADIDAS. We buy the
magazines, the video games, the key
chains and the posters. Various entities
- athletic departments, media outlets,
apparel sponsors, top-flight coaches -
cash in for billions when all is said and
dose.
The only ones who don't, it seems, are
the athletes who pu their bodies and

futures on the line for our entertain-
ment.
California State University-San Mar-
cos economist Robert Brown told ESPN.
com for a December 2009 story that the
average NFL-bound college football
player would be worth $1.3 million to
$1.36 million per season to his school "if
the college game were subject to mar-
ket forces similar to those that govern
the NFL." Former Florida quarterback
Tim Tebow, he said, would likely be paid
more than $2.5 million.
Tebow's full-ride scholarship was
worth $13,000 a year.
Critics of the status quo contend that
amateurism is not so much an ideal as
an outdated construct, beloved for its
quaintness but ultimately servingto bar
those who generate value from the com-
pensation to which they're entitled.
Through the decades, beneath the
positive developments for fairness in
intercollegiate competition - most nota-
bly desegregation and Title IX - the
lurking trend of perpetually increas-
ing commercialization has led activists,
national columnists and some politi-
cians to insist that the public has been
misled, and that the brunt of the labor
going into college athletics goes toward
lining the pockets of everyone but the
laborers themselves.
Ernie Chambers is a former long-time
Nebraska state senator who repeat-

edly introduced legislation that would
require stipends for college football and
basketball players in the state. It never
came to be.
"There should not be surprise at the
number of young guys who take what
are called 'extra benefits,' " Chambers
said in a recent interview. "The shock
should be that not all of them do it."
Chambers, who never uses the word
scholarships without preceding it with
"so-called" and prefers to call them
"contracts of indenture," says athletes in
the revenue-producing sports - at most
schools, just football and basketball -
are entitled to compensation for the
value they bringto universities.
"No other level or classification of
employees could be treated as unjustly
as all these players, generating this
amount of money, and nothing be said
about it," he said.
According to Erik Christianson,
director of public and media relations
for the NCAA, athletic scholarships are
compensation enough.
"Their goal is to graduate and to
achieve that college education," he said.
Indeed, to overlook scholarships or
to downplay their importance would
be to ignore a great opportunity given
to athletes, especially those who other-
wise could not afford it or could not get
into college. Without a doubt, athletic
scholarships have had an immeasurable

impact on the lives of these athletes and
arguably on society as a whole.
"You can't say that the players don't
get something," said Bill Martin, the
University of Michigan's recently
retired athletic director and former
president of the U.S. Olympic Commit-
tee. "They get an education. They get an
opportunity to experience college life
and all the positive attributes of that."
Martin didn't dismiss the moral and
philosophical case for paying student-
athletes, but he did note several legal
and practical nightmares that could
come from it.
Most would agree that the effort and
exertion aren't necessarily greater for
revenue-producing athletes than those
in non-revenue sports, which he said
would lead to controversy in the hypo-
thetical scenario in which football and
basketball players got paid.
He said he would anticipate such
a move to be challenged in the courts
under Title IX, which ensures gender
equality in college sports, if on no other
basis.
Above all, though, Martin said the
money just isn't there in most cases.
Only 14 Division I athletic depart-
ments - out of 335 - earn revenues that
exceed their expenses, according to
Christianson, the NCAA spokesman.
And even forschools that have profitable
football and basketball programs, the

money earned goes primarily toward
paying student scholarships and subsi-
dizingthe non-revenue sports.
"If push came to shove," Martin said,,
"and Congress were to say 'OK, pay
them,' what would athletic departments
do? Cut sports. So we decrease the num-
ber of opportunities to appropriate par-
ticipation in college spots at the varsity
level."
He said that while he was athletic
director at the University, before the
opening of the renovated Michigan
Stadium, "four (football) games out of
eight, every penny of gate receipts ...
went toward scholarships."
Butthe simmering question is wheth-
er, for many revenue-producing ath-
letes, success in athletics comes at the
expense of education.
The NCAA touts a statistic that says
Division I athletes are more likely to
graduate than the general student body.
But they won't draw attentionto the fact
that for athletes in revenue sports (foot-
ball and basketball), the NCAA-report-
ed graduation success rates are lower
than all the other sports by a significant
margin (67 percent for FBS football ath-
letes and 64 percent for men's basketball
compared to79 percentoverall).
Pressed on this, Christianson said
that new numbers that show improve-
ment in those sports are forthcom-
ing, and that the current rates show an

upward trend from previous years. The
NCAA website has only broken links
to the pre-2009 data, and requests for
the information were not returned by
NCAA officials.
Certainly, some of this gap can be
accounted for by early attrition to pro-
fessional sports. But considering only
1.2 percent and 1.8 percent of all NCAA
athletes in men's basketball and football
players respectively end up going pro,
according to the NCAA, that effect has
to be relatively miniscule.
Martin said that the other major fac-
tor in play here is the admissions stan-
dards of academic institutions. The
"sliding scale" system, which allows
for tradeoffs between GPA and stan-
dardized test scores on NCAA-clearing
admissions standards, was changed in
2003 to increase the extent to which one
can compensate for the other.
According to Martin, this amounted
to "relaxed" admissions standards for
NCAA athletes, which Chambers insists
were already far too low to take serious-.

ly the NCAA's and universities' claims to
have athletes' best academic interests at
heart.
Chambers also disputes the argu-
ment that programs couldn't afford to
pay athletes because, after all, top pro-
grams find the money to compensate
coaches handsomely. He said this con-
tradiction amounts to hypocrisy on the
part of NCAA and the universities.
He bemoaned the fact that it's often
the same coaches quoted spouting about
character, personal dignity and loyalty
who end up bolting for greener pastures
when a more lucrative opportunity pres-
ents itself.
He brought up Brian Kelly, Notre
Dame's first-year coach who left an
ascendant Cincinnati pro-
gram last winter for the
Irish.
"Cincinnati was having a
great season, was going to a
bowl game. He talked about
how he loved it, his fam-
ily loved it. Everyone was
happy," Chambers said.
"When the siren call came from
Notre Dame, without letting those play-
ers know, he jumped ship. Some of them
found out from the media. Reporters
asked them how they felt about it. Some
didn't even know. And ata meeting that
was called, some of them left the meet-
ing in tears."

"This coach for whom they played
their hearts out left them in the lurch,"
he said. "It's almost poetic justice that
Notre Dame is doing as poorly as it is."
Many will defend the fact that some
football coaches are the highest-paid
public employees in their states with
the "free market" justification. But this
always begs the question: If it were truly
a free market, why would the players,
who arguably deliver the same kind
of value as the coaches, be excluded?
There's certainly irony in the fact that
amateurism in college sports is consid-
ered profoundly American, while it goes
against one of our deepest-held beliefs:
that capitalism is the only way.
Christianson said the difference is
that players are amateurs and coaches
are employees.
To JasonWinfree, a professor ofkine-
siology at the University of Michigan
and an expert on the NCAA, this ratio-
nalization falls short because it creates a
false distinction. A self-proclaimed free-
market guy, Winfree sees it as a moral
debate, not a semantic one.
"It's hard to argue, I think, that col-
lege athletes shouldn't be paid and that
everybody else should be paid," he said.
"It seems like a stretch to me."
"A lot of people sort of have this reac-
tion ... Why do they need all that money?
Can they handle it at that age?" Winfree
said.

"But they're already being taken
advantage of," he said, and not just by
the money they bring in, but often with
humiliation.
Winfree lamented the pressure on a
20-year-old athlete on national televi-
sion: "If they screw up, everybody sees
them screw up."
He posits that the fairest system
would completely embrace the market.
Players would sign contracts, Winfree
said, and a backup kicker could end up
earning far less than the starting run-
ning back. When asked whether he
would cut the wages of a highly touted
freshman quarterback who underper-
forms, he said he would.
He also suggests that athletes
shouldn't be required to be students. "If
they're really not academically oriented,
what good is that going to do them any-
way? They don't value that. And maybe
they shouldn't value that. You hate to
say this on a campus, but college isn't for
everybody."
Winfree's proposal presents prob-
lems because it would likely result in
high school athletes needing agents to
navigate the recruitment and contract
process, something Winfree admits is
less than ideal for a 17-year-old.
Chambers detests the idea of paying
some players more than others. He says
such attitudes only give fuel to the pay-
