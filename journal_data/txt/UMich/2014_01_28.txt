T00 COOL FOR SCHOOL

Facing windchills
around -30 degrees,
University cancels all
classes on Tuesday
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
and MAX RADWIN
Daily News Editor and
Daily StaffReporter
For the first time since 1978, the
University has canceled classes
Tuesday due to extreme weather,
University spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald confirmed Monday evening.
According to the National Weath-
er Service, temperatures will be at a
high of 2 degrees, with a wind chill
reaching -30 degrees and winds
reaching up to 20 miles per hour.
Campus buildings - including
dining halls and libraries - will
remain open. University transporta-
tion services will continue operating
as normal, though delays should be
expected.
This announcement marks the
first time that the University has
cancelled classes due to weather-
related circumstances since Ann
Arbor was hit with 19 inches of snow
in 1978.
University Police spokeswoman
Diane Brown said University Police
will be taking extra efforts to keep
response times low to limit the
amount of time that people spend
outside in the cold.
After Fitzgerald confirmed the
decision, University Provost Martha
Pollack, Chief Health Officer Rob-
ert Winfield and Laurita Thomas,
associate vice president for human
resources, sent a memo to faculty

sity's decision to not cancel classes.
"By the time it became clear that
we were facing an extraordinary
weather event, we realized that
we didn't have appropriate mecha-
nisms to close the University even if
we wanted to," Pollack said.
During that meeting, Pollack said
the University planned to establish
a committee to address emergency
situations, including weather, that
merit the cancellation of classes.
Though that committee was
formed and held one meeting last
week, Fitzgerald said the decision
to cancel classes Tuesday was made
independently of that committee, in
consultation with the the Office of
the Provost, Winfield and Thomas.
"This is a decision that was made
based on the unique circumstances
that are being presented with the
weather forecasts for tomorrow,"
Fitzgerald said. "This is not a reflec-
tion of any new protocol."
Business senior Michael Proppe,
CSG president, said he believes the
dangerous conditions Tuesday war-
ranted the historic measure.
"It's really going to be cold tomor-
row, I think the University made the
right call," Proppe said. "When it's
-25 degrees out with the wind chill
and you have students walking 10,
15, or 20 minutes to class, it can be
dangerous to have skin exposed in
that kind of weather."
Proppe said he was surprised
because such a decision is "unprec-
edented," but added that he knows
the University has students safety at
the forefront.
"Though CSG did not play an
active role in today's decision,
executive members brought up the
school's lack of a severe weather

time since 1978.

and staff encouraging flexibil-
ity and telecommuting if pos-
sible for Tuesday.
"Campus operations will
continue," the memo said.
"However, while staff should
plan to report as usual, we ask
that supervisors be flexible
and make reasonable accom-
modations for these extreme
circumstances. Travel may be
hazardous, especially on foot

or by bus, and we ask that all
of our colleagues remain sensi-
tive to safety concerns. Parking
and Transportation Services
is increasing bus frequency to
help minimize wait times."
The memo added that staff
who are "unable or choose not
to" travel to campus Tuesday
should contact their supervi-
sors to use vacation time or
unpaid time off.

Medical School Prof,
Charles Koopmann, a member
of the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs,
said he feels it's "unfortunate"
that staff on main campus have
to come in or be forced to take
a day of vacation. However,
he said he believes that the
medical campus should remain
open, which, according to the
memo, will operate normally.

"The University needs to
get a well organized plan for
something like this and should
remarkably improve communi-
cations," Koopmann said.
After the controversy over
not closing campus during
the Polar Vortex earlier this
month, Pollack sat in on the
Senate Advisory Committee
for University Affairs meeting
Jan. 13 to discuss the Univer-

'U's new social media
director pushes ahead

Sunstrum, a former
state social media
specialist, focuses on
diverse platforms
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Managing NewsEditor
When the University's Board of
Regents announced the selection
of Mark Schlissel as the Univer-
sity's 14th president, one new staff
member sat among the audience

members in the Michigan Union,
vigorously updating the Univer-
sity's social media sites.
While Nikki Sunstrum, the
University's new director of social
media, didn't get a press conference
on her arrival, she did fill an empty
spot in the University's Global
Communications Office.
Sunstrum was selected for the
position after a year-long search.
She previously served as the state
of Michigan's social communica-
tions coordinator and started in her
new position on Jan. 6. In her state
position, Sunstrum oversaw more

than 149 social media accounts and
curated regular live chats and town
hall forums.
Jordan Miller, the University's
former social media director,
resigned in December 2012 amid
allegations that she lied about com-
pleting her bachelor's degree.
Sunstrum received her bach-
elor's degree from Grand Valley
State University and her master's
from Aquinas College. While the
University was unable to specify
how much Sunstrum would be
paid, Miller earned about $100,000

Students hesitant

By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
At the Jan. 21 Central Student
Government Assembly meeting,
Engineering junior Andy Modell,
a CSG representative, proposed
the idea to use Dining Dollars for
meals served at Hillel.
Currently, students can only
use Blue Bucks or cash to pay

for Hillel meals, excluding free
Friday-night dinners, which are
open to everyone. Hillel is a foun-
dation that provides program-
ming for Jewish students on
campus and serves kosher meals.
For a student on a regular
residence hall meal plan, Hil-
lel charges $10 for lunch and
$12 for dinner. If students with
a religious exception choose to
forego the traditional meal plan,
they can opt for an alternate Hil-
lel meal plan. These students pay
the same amount as a student on
the average residence hall meal
plan, receiving guaranteed meals

says shared services
still important
ByANDREWALMANI
Daily StaffReporter
In her final Senate Assembly
meeting, University President
Mary Sue Coleman addressed a
multitude of faculty concerns,
including the implementa-
tion of the Shared Services
Center, employee wages and
diversity at Palmer Commons
Monday.
The University is in the
process of implementing a
variety of cost-cutting ini-
tiatives, including the con-

troversial Administrative
Services Transformation,
a cost-cutting initiative
which includes the imple-
mentation of the Shared
Service Center that will
consolidate some Univer-
sity departmental staff in a
central location.
In terms of its expendi-
tures, Coleman said the Uni-
versity is much larger than
most other public higher edu-
cation institutions. She cited
the University of California -
Berkeley's budget of $2.1 bil-
lion - a much smaller amount
than the University's $6.1 bil-
lion budget - as an example
from a similar highly ranked
public institution.
Coleman added that the
overarching University of
California system performs

many of the administrative
tasks at Berkeley that the
University has to perform
autonomously on campus.
"It is not apples to apples to
look at the scope of work, the
span of control, of individuals
work on the Berkeley campus
and the Michigan campus,"
Coleman said.
Coleman said it is impor-
tant to limit growth and taper
spending.
"We know we've got to stay
affordable and accessible, she
said.
While members of the fac-
ulty have voiced opposition
to the University's consolida-
tion efforts, Coleman said the
plan affects her as well.

has been cut significantly,

CAPS application provides
mechanism for stress release

Stressbusters
Wellness app features
health tips, exercises
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
Overwhelmed students can
now find stress-relieving solace
through the touch of a button--or
a few keystrokes, really.
University Counseling and
Psychological Services and its

student advisory board launched
the Stressbusters Wellness mobile
application earlier this month
during Winterfest, a student orga-
nization fair held in the Michigan
Union Jan. 15. The app is current-
ly available for no cost on both iOS
and Android phones.
The Wellness app includes
many stress-reducing features
including those customized for
University students. Users can use
the app to share daily stress-reduc-
ing and emotional health tips and
view news alerts, videos and audio

tracks that dictate simple stress
relieving exercises. The app also
includes one-touch emergency
buttons, among other features.
"We're really trying to reach
all students to address what is
going on underneath all the stress
and anxiety," said CAPS Director
Todd Sevig. "We hope this is one
part of that overall focus for us."
The app was produced by the
national Stressbusters Wellness
program and was customized
to meet the needs of college stu
dents. The University is among
one of the first higher education
institutionss to adopt the app.
JordaoaFriedmno, director of the
Natioonal Stressbusters Wellness
program, said the app serves to give
studeots an1 opportunity to access
the organizations resources.
"Not everyone can come to a
Stressbusters event," Friedman
said. "We wanted to be able to
get students and staff convenient
stress reduction and relaxation
resources wherever they are."
Although the app was devel-
oped this year, the idea to bring an
app to campus centering on stu-
dent wellness was initiated by the
SAB two years ago.
CAPS and the SAB worked on
bringing the app to the University
during fall 2013. In preparation
for the app's launch, CAPS col-
lected student-written encour-
agement messages and made
videos with a University-focus on
stress management. The app also
includes videos created by the
national program.
Sevig added that in the future,
the app may include pictures of
relaxing places on campus in addi-
tion to the written messages.
The Wellness app also includes
a Health Rewards system that
allows students to accumulate
points for participating in CAPS
programs. Students can redeem
points for discounts and Universi-
ty-themed items.
"We have seen increased num-
bers of students feeling anxiety,"
Sevig said. "We're trying to get
creative and address some of the
root causing creating stress and
anxiety on our campus."

Protesters march in central Kiev, Ukraine, Monday. Ukraine's justice minister is threatening to call for a state-of
emergency unless protesters leave her ministry building, which they occupied during the night.
After backlash against police,
Ukraine reverses protest laws

Pending amnesty
offer may bring
end to protests
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -
Ukraine's beleaguered presi-
dent on Monday agreed to
scrap harsh anti-protest laws
that set off a wave of clashes
between protesters and police
over the past week, a potential-
ly substantial concession to the
opposition that stopped short of
meeting all of its demands.
In a possibly major stick-
ing point, a proposed amnesty
for arrested protesters would
not be offered unless dem-
onstrators stopped occupy-
ing buildings and ended their
round-the-clock protests and
tent camp on Kiev's central
Independence Square, accord-
ing to a statement by Justice
Minister Elena Lukash on the
presidential website.
President Viktor Yanu-
kovych has been under increas-
ing pressure since he pushed
the tough laws through parlia-
ment, setting of clashes and
protests in other parts of the
country in a sharp escalation of
tensions after weeks of mostly
peaceful protests over his rejec-

tion of a deal to deepen ties with
the 28-nation European Union.
At a meeting between top
opposition figures and Yanu-
kovych late Monday "a political
decision was made on scrap-
ping the laws of Jan. 16, which
aroused much discussion,"
Lukash said.
She made no mention of a
key opposition demand - that
Yanukovych resign.
One of the opposition figures,
Arseniy Yatsenyuk, turned
down the prime minister's job,
which Yanukovych had offered
him on Saturday, the statement
said.
Eliminating the laws, which
is likely to be done in a spe-
cial parliament session Tues-
day, appears to be a serious
step back for the government.
The session is also expected
to include a discussion of gov-
ernment responsibility in the
crisis, suggesting a cabinet
reshuffle could be imminent.
It was not immediately clear
how the announcement would
be received. On Independence
Square, there was no immedi-
ate reaction from the relatively
small crowd gathered in bitter
cold near midnight.
A key issue will be the
amnesty offer, which could

allow for the release of dozens
of protesters currently being
held in jail in exchange for an
end to the demonstrations.
The statement did not say the
opposition would agree to those
terms. Doing so could infuri-
ate radical factions within the
broad-based protest movement,
such as the group called Right
Sector that has driven much of
the recent violence.
Several hours before the
statement, Right Sector issued
its own demands, which
include punishing officials
responsible for the deaths and
abuse of protesters, disbanding
Ukraine's feared riot police and
locating all missing opposition
figures.
Protest leaders say scores of
people have gone missing, pre-
sumably arrested.
Three protesters died in the
clashes last week, two of whom
were shot by hunting rifles,
which police insist they do not
use.
Protesters have been afraid
that authorities were preparing
to end the spreading demon-
strations by force, but the for-
eign ministry said earlier the
government has no immediate
plans to declare a state of emer-
gency.

Mayoral candidate
raises $5 million

Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
raised about $5.1 million last year
toward his re-election bid and
not surprisingly starts the year
with a financial advantage over
his likely Democratic opponent,
Mark Schauer.
The Snyder campaign said
Monday that it would report hav-

end after spending $1.9 million in
2013. The Schauer campaign will
report raising around $1.6 million
and having at least $1 million cash
on hand, a spokesman said.
Detailed campaign finance
reports showing donors and
expenses don't need to be submit-
ted to the state until Friday. But
Snyder's announcement was the

Iraqi policeman in the village of
Hamdania in 2006 and shooting
him to death in a ditch, Marine

The military prosecution has
evidence to support its murder

The husband of a pregnant,

machines.
Erick Munoz said Monday that
he named the 23-week-old fetus
Nicole, which was his late wife's

say why he chose to name the
fetus.
Munoz said doctors at John
Peter Smith Hospital in Fort

Worth indicated to him that the
fetus would likely have been a

After three years working for the state,
Sunstrum said she is excited to take her
social media work to the global level.
"Going globally gives us a different
opportunity to seek out how our content
will play into other audiences," she said.
"My first goal for the year is bringing every-
one together. We have a lot of accounts, and
they're all on different levels. So, how can
we work together so that we're all leverag-
ing the collective audience."
Sunstrum said she has already met with
representatives from the University'sdiffer-
ent schools and colleges to understand their
social media needs and aspirations.
During Miller's stint as director of social
media, she curated the University's social

media platforms and profile, and launched
the @umichstudents Twitter account in
July 2012.
Sunstrum said she plans to maintain
and enhance the University's several social
media accounts. For example, Sunstrum
hopes to shift the focus of @umichstudents
to not only current University students, but
to prospective applicants who may be inter-
ested in understanding the campus com-
munity. Sunstrum has met with orientation
teams to gauge a better understanding of
whatgoes into welcomingnew students.
Since she attended graduate school
for education, Sunstrum said she has the
opportunity togive guestlectures and speak
on different elements of social media.
"I think I'm going to turn things on its
head a little bit," she said. "A little more
strategy-based - I'm going to leave the cre-
ative part to the people who know how to do
that well. I'm going to focus on really grow-
ing our audiences and making ourselves
look great on a global scale."

In December 2012, Reddit user citizen-
throwawayx announced in apost that Mill-
er did not complete her Bachelors of Arts in
Journalism degree from Columbia College
Chicago as it reads on her resum. Accord-
ingto the documents, Miller was a few cred-
its short of graduating.
William Gregory, a records specialist at
Columbia College Chicago, confirmed that
Miller did not graduate.
"My intention was never to deceive the
University, but I acknowledge that I made
a mistake, and I'm sorry," Miller wrote in
a statement to the University regarding her
resignation.
University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said in December 2012 that Miller resigned
willingly with no disciplinary action taken
against her.
In a January 2013 interview, Fitzgerald
said each department and specific position
undergoes a unique background check and
interview in their employment process.
Regarding how the University may have

missed Miller's error, he added that it was "a
very unusual set of circumstances."
Student Advisor ranked the University
as the 29th best social media-using college,
ranking it fifth for its Instagram account
and as the "Most Collaborative Large Col-
lege."
The Universityhas nearly63,000 Twitter
followers, its Instagram page holds nearly
27,000 followers and its Facebook page
boasts nearlyl538,000 "Likes."
As for where social media is heading,
Sunstrum said the future is unpredictable.
To maintain its importance in day-to-day
life, she added that social media should
become integrated into everyday goals and
objectives.
"My job didn't exist five years ago,
and it very well could not exist five years
from now," she said. "We need to find
a way to make social less shiny; it's not
really that pet project on the side on the
more ... A tweet is just the new press
release."


HILLEL
From Page 1A
Hillel. However, these students
do not have access to dining
halls on campus.
Engineering sophomore Maia
Hoberman, a student on the
alternative Hillel meal plan, said
the current system segregates
her from many of her friends
on campus who use the stan-
dard University meal plans. She
added that this separation is dif-
ficult for freshmen in residence
halls that are trying to meet new
people.
"Those of us who are on the
meal plan here are completely
isolated from other students,"
Hoberman said. "One of the
main ways to socialize on cam=
pus is to hang out with people
over meals, and I never got to do
that."
She also said many of her
friends are reluctant to join her
at Hillel, adding that they need
to save their Blue Bucks for
laundry. If these students had
the option of paying with Dining
Dollars, she said, they would be
much more willing to spend the
money on a Hillel meal.
Increased student attendance
at Hillel would also benefit the
organization, which makes a
negligible profit off of students.
Friday night dinners are free
through donations from outside
the University. Hillel currently
receives the large majority of
profits from the Jewish commu-
nity of Ann Arbor that uses it as
a restaurant during the week.
LSA sophomore Jacob

Abudaram, a CSG Representa-
tive, said that students who do
not have the opportunity to eat
at Hillel are often missing out on
high-quality food as well as the
opportunity to experience this
aspect of their culture. He hopes
that the introduction of Din-
ing Dollars at Hillel will expose
more students across the Uni-
versity to the Hillel experience.
"It would make Hillel meals
much more open," he said. "It
would allow Jews and non-
Jews to just eat a good meal
together."
Engineering junior Nathan
Immerman, a CSG Represen-
tative, reiterated Abudaram's
emphasis on exposing Hillel to
more students, and the respon-
sibility of the University to
encourage openness across the
student body.
"One of the goals of Hil-
lel, and also of Central Student
Government and the Univer-
sity, is building a community,"
Immerman said.
Though the three aforemen-
tioned representatives work-
ing on the proposal have yet
to have any official meetings
with the University, Abudaram
is optimistic about the future
of the proposal and does not
anticipate issues with getting
this passed.
Modell shares Abudaram's
optimism, and cited the propos-
al as an extension ofcore values
that the Michigan community
prides itself in.
"It's all about options at
Michigan, and when these little
things get in the way, it's some-
thing we want to fix," Modell
said.

From Page 1A
WFrom July 2013 to June
2014, diners at Main Street eat-
eries have been invited to add a
donation of any amount to the
bottom of their checks, which
will be donated in full to UMHS.
The participating bars and res-
taurants include Lena, Habana,
Grizzly Peak Brewing Company,
Old German, Blue Tractor BBQ
and Brewery, Jolly Pumpkin Cafe
and Brewery and Mash. Each
month a different charity within
UMHS will be chosen.
Jon Carlson and Greg Lobdell,
co-owners of all of the restau-
rants involved, are the driving
force behind the program. Carl-
son said they chose the 12 receiv-
ing foundations based on both
necessity and personal interests,
with their focus main set on chil-
drens' health. Accordingly, C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital is well-
represented, as four months of
the program have been dedicated
to different Mott programs.
"We were prettyeasy targets -
he has two kids, and I have three,"
Carlson said. "I think it made us
suckers. It's so easy to see the help
that you can give to little kids."
While they said they have held

many philanthropic events to sup-
port the Ann Arbor community,
this event is their first attempt at
a year long, interconnected fund-
raiser. Lobdell said with all of the
standalone events he and Carlson
were hosting to support UMHS,
it made more sense to do one big
event.
"We were just doing individual
efforts with people we knew, with a
lot ofit focused on U ofM Hospital,"
Lobdell said. "Finally, they actually
came together and said 'we're all
talking to them separately ... why
don't we all work together?"'
Supplementing Dine and
Donate, Carlson and Lobdell have
held extra promotions to support
certaincharitiesthey feel a connec-
tion with.
University alum Charles
Woodson, a former football play-
er and Heisman Trophy Win-
ner who now plays in the NFL,
started the Charles Woodson
Clinical Research Fund with a $2
million donation to Mott. During
the month supporting Woodson's
fund, Carlson and Lobdell served
a special "Woodson Burger" at
each participating restaurant.
For every Woodson Burger sold
in October, $2 went to support
his fund. Lobdell said the burg-
ers sold were based onWoodson's
own preferences.

"We talked with him and found
out what types of burgers that he
likes, and then challenged each
of the chefs to, from his inspira-
tion, create their own version of
a Charles Woodson burger." Lob-
dell said. "It was a fun addition to
the other program."
To get Dine & Donate up and
running, Carlson and Lobdell
worked closely with Dina Kutin-
sky, assistant director for devel-
opment, women and children's
health at UMHS. Kutinsky said
the choices of foundations for
Dine and Donate span the health-
care system, and the fundraiser is
meant in part to raise awareness.
"The program is built to really
educate and to create awareness."
Kutinsky said. "So not only to
raise money, but so people know
that these funds are out there."
Kutinsky said he hopes Dine
and Donate would continue after
its yearlong term ends in June.
She said she, Carlson, Lobdell and
others will cooperate to work out
kinks in the project.
"Next year, hopefully, we'll
look at the whole program, and
see which ones worked, which
ones didn't, which ones need
more attention." Kutinsky said.
"We're really testing the waters. I
think if they keep doing it it'll get
bigger and bigger."

almost cut in half," Coleman
said. "We've consolidated our
activates, we've asked people to
do more, we've given people in
the office more span of control,
and we've paid them more."
Thom Madden, senior proj-
ects director of the AST, also
spoke to SACUA about the
implementation of the Shared
Services Center. Madden came
into his role after the for-
mer leader Rowan Miranda,
associate vice president for
finance, stepped down from
his role.
"I believe in this, I truly
believe this is an appropri-
ate and strategic decision for
the University of Michigan,"
Madden said.
The University hired
Accenture, LLP, a Chicago-
based consulting firm, for
$11.7 million to plan and
help carry out the transition
process. Miranda previously
worked for the firm, which
raised concerns among fac-
ulty due to speculation that
there may be a conflict of
interest in his involvement.
Miranda announced on
Jan. 21 he will leave the Uni-
versity to become the trea-
surer and senior associate
vice president for finance and
administration at the Univer-
sity of Chicago.
Before the holiday season,
there was some concern that
faculty and staff input wasn't
being considered in the move
to the center. Madden said
this would not be the case.
"Certainly it was impor-
tant for us before the holi-
days to take a step back,
look at exactly we were in
the process, and reevaluate
what an appropriate path
forward will look like in

order to ensure the success
of this project," Madden said.
"We will continue to look for
engaged advisers, whether
they be staff or faculty ... this
is a collaborative effort, and
from my perspective there is
nothing off the table."
During a question-and-
answer session, Coleman was
asked about diversity on cam-
pus, with specific focus on
the declining acceptance rate
for Black students.
Since its conception in
November, the BBUM cam-
paign has garnered national
attention as members used
the Twitter hashtag to share
experiences of racial injus-
tice at the University. After
witnessing student response
to the campaign, Univer-
sity Provost Martha Pollack
announced a series a new
initiatives that the Univer-
sity will pursue to increase
minority enrollment and
retention on campus.
"I was deeply distressed
about the student campaign,"
Coleman. "It was very pain-
ful to listen to because it is
our collective responsibil-
ity to make this a welcoming
place foir everybody. I think
we're going to have renewed
effort, we've opened a dia-
logue with students to figure
out in a concrete way what we
can do."
Coleman concluded her
comments on diversity by
assuring the Senate that her
successor, University Pres-
ident-elect Mark Schlissel,
Brown University's provost,
will be committed to making
progress.
"I know that Mark Schlis-
sel cares about this issue
deeply, he and I talked about
it. He had some of the same
issues at Berkeley. I want
to, in my last six months, do
everything I can; I think we
all should."

Fueling Detroit's comeback
Gov. Snyder should not allow Detroit to flounder without state aid
n Jan. 22, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder proposed redirecting $350
million over 20 years from Michigan's tobacco settlement revenue to
the city of Detroit. The reallocation of funds was pledged in order to
help bolster city pensions, estimated to be underfunded by $3.5 billion. Snyder
stressed that his proposal is not a bailout, but rather a settlement focused on
mitigating the impact on retirees. By allotting this money to the city, Snyder
is crossing party lines and showing the rest of the state that Detroit is worth
the investment. The proposed plan will undoubtedly aid pensioners; however,
future funding from the state should be allocated by the city itself.

With the announcement of his proposal last
week, Snyder demonstrated his commitment
to Detroit. Designating much-needed funds to
city pensions will potentially benefit the entire
state by speeding up the bankruptcy process
and reducing legal expenses. However, the
proposed plan must first be approved by the
legislature before reaching the bankruptcy
mediation table. Both Democratic and
Republican leaders are on board with the
solution, voicing their support for Snyder's
proposal. Though, some Republicans are
wary of the plan, calling for some type of
professional oversight of the pension funds.
The key component of this plan is guarantee-
ing the money will actually fund city pensions.
Many city employees worked their entire adult
lives paying into their pensions. These pen-
sioners deserve to live out their retirement in
financial security and dignity. Even with the
state's proposed financial assistance plan and
privately pledged donations reaching $330 mil-
lion from nine local and national foundations,
pensioners could see a sharp reduction in their
monthly benefits. It's imperative that Snyder's
proposed money go to Detroit's retirees.

Snyder and the state government need to
continue supporting Detroit - financially and
beyond. The city is not only a vital part of Mich-
igan's history but also its future. Detroit offers
many incredible attractions -the DetroitInsti-
tute of Arts, Belle Isle Park, Detroit Eastern
Market, Greektown and the Motown Histori-
cal Museum, to name a few. However, Detroit's
charisma lies not in its physical- structures
but in the unique cultures and spirit created
within the city. Every day, people are moving
to Detroit, workinghard alongside currentresi-
dents to rebuild an iconic American city.
Gov. Snyder has taken steps in the right
direction with his plan to help city pension-
ers. Detroit has a long way to go before it can
become what it once was again. In order to get
back to its full potential, the city needs con-
tinued support from the state and businesses
alike. General Motors, the industrial behe-
moth of the Motor City, pledged to upgrade
their Detroit plant helping to create and
retain jobs in the city. With increasing inno-
vation, investment and job creation, Detroit
has the ability to revitalize its economy and
propel Michigan into the future.

Looking down on hooking up

Let's talk about libido

"Hooking up" may refer to many activities,
ranging from casual kissing to intercourse. The
term itself has a certain ambiguity that appeals
to the college environment where - unless you
live in close proximity to your acquaintances -
you too can benefit from remaining somewhat
ambiguous. The issue is thus: hookup culture
continues to become more prominent in
universities. This culture holds the potential
to instill damaging morals into the minds of
students who may eventually have trouble
developing real relationships later in life.
The 1970s proved essential to motivating the
explosion of this culture when birth control
and various birth control methods became
more mass-produced and readily available.
Some argue that these innovations essentially
made obsolete the need for relationships in
college. Many students may now ask, "What's
the point in being committed to one person?"
College is a system that fosters individualism,
independence and the right to further one's
own educational and moral development. It's
no surprise that between the periods of 1980-
1990 and 2000-2010, the percentage of college
studentsreported to have "had sex with a friend
in the previous year" rose from 56 percent to
68 percent - based on a General Social Survey
of 2,000 students from different universities.
The institutions themselves provide a basis for
hookup justification: this is the student's world,
and these are the student's decisions.
For new college freshmen from smaller high
schools, exposure to the hookup culture of larg-
er universities can prove especially intimidat-
ing. Many of these students find the transition
difficult and feel pressured to make rash deci-
sions. It is this blend of hookup-accustomed
freshmen and those who were raised in more
conservative environments that proves most
dangerous. For example, one student pursues
another not solely for physical desire, but rather
for the establishment of a real emotional con-
nection. The other party wants nothing of the
sort. The one who wants something real is
crushed; we have seen it countless times.
Also dangerous is the intricate, fragile web of
connections made by hooking up with several
people. Thoughts of past and current hookups
may plague those newly influenced by the
culture withjealousyor fear. "Whyisshe kissing
him if we hooked up last week?" and "he told
everyone that we hooked up," are commonly
heard phrases schoolwide. Considering many
hookups take place while one or both parties
are under the influence of alcohol, there is

also room for regret and remorse. Impaired
judgment clashes with the fuel of desire and
sparks the resulting hookup. It is a kiss. It is
an exchange of words. It is atrip to a bedroom
followed by early-morning disappointment. It is
whatever you want it to be.
A study done at Stanford University surveyed
about 17,000 college students during their time
at their respective universities and reported
that by senior year, 72 percent of both sexes
had hooked up at least once. The average male
reported having nine to 10 hookups, the average
female about seven hookups. This means, for
example, that Boy A has a history with 10 girls.
He may see relationship potential in some, and
he may desire the complete avoidance of others.
He may see them as objects; he may see them as
friendswithbenefits. Butultimately,heremains
unsure. Boy A is a victim of this spreading
culture and these increasing percentages. His
views of women are distorted; he has forgotten
the value in dating and now pursues the facility
of more selfish, individual physical desires.
This is not to argue that the hookup culture
lacks advantages. With busy class schedules
and accelerated course work, University of
Michigan students may not have time to
adequately maintain relationships. However,
despite the benefits of relative ease and
convenience, statistics show that preference-
wise, both genders still prefer traditional dating.
In a study done with males and females from a
Southern public university, only 2 percent of
women and 17 percent of men showed a strong
preference for hooking up over traditional
dating. This is positive; however, the difference
in percentages proves alarming. This statistic
essentially suggests that there are women,
internally desiring a real relationship, settling
for hookups merely because a significantly
bigger population of men won't settle for
relationships.
Despite the alarming percentages and stats,
at least we can safely determine that the dating
relationship, while preferred less now than
in recent years, is still more desirable than
the hookup. And it should be. The emotional
damage, jealousy, general uneasiness and sense
of remorse that may exist after a hookup is
enough to turn many students away; however,;
the concepts of college independence and ease
keep the practice alive.Are college relationships
dead? No. Are they in a losing battle with the
ever-risinghookup? Let us hope not.

Rush Limbaugh and former Mis-

in fact all been an attempt to fight for
"the recognition of the equality of
women and the capacity of women"
accordingto Huckabee.
The former Arkansas governor
declared the war's end last week at
the Republican National Convention

Democrats of taking advantage of
women for political gain: "If the
Democrats want to insult the women
of America by making them believe
that they are helpless without Uncle
Sugar coming in and providing for
them a prescription each month for
birth control, because they cannot
control their libido or their reproduc-
tive system without the help of the
government, then so be it."
Huckabee totally blew the
Democrats' cover last week when
he went on to say, "Women I know
are outraged that Democrats think
that women are nothing more than
helpless and hopeless creatures
whose only goal in life is to have the
government provide for them birth

Even at the ripe ole' age of
72, Crosby can still uncover the
dismal nature of the surround-

from a friend bring back pain."
At this risk of morbidly fixat-
ing on the subject of loneliness,
there are many turnarounds.
Suddenly we're asked to "Set
the Baggage Down" and take
"everything that's broken and
bury it in the sand" - a bit of
advice drawn from 14 years
of Alcoholic's Anonymous,
according to Crosby. Broken-

Low-sales expectation or not,
the casually thrown-together
record captures a more nuanced
narrative than most contem-

2010s. Lyrics tend to come in
bulk after 20 years-worth of
silent observations, after all.

The Grammy Awards rolled
around once again this past
weekend, and in the world of
music media, it forced writers
to do one of two things: react to
the awards as
if they con-
tained some
meaningful
impact, or
justify why
the Grammys
aren't worth A
reacting to. ELLIOT
I find myself ALPERN
soundly
astride the
fence in between. The Grammy
decisions, just like any other
awards show, are absolutely
influenced by popularity over
talent (see Macklemore vs. Ken-
drick Lamar, later), and don't
offer a realistic judgment of
the best music produced in any
given year. But still, isn't it fun
just to see who gets to bask in
the glory of the spotlight, even
for a moment's notice?
I'd be remiss in my duties,
though, if I didn't first throw
out the classic disclaimer: the
Grammys love their winners
with a story, with a growing
following, with anything that'll
help an artist get sold.
The growing optimism I'd
felt from an Arcade Fire win
in 2010 was dashed two years
later as "Somebody That I
Used To Know" (a good, albeit
chart-topping song), Mumford
& Sons, fun., Kanye and Jay-Z-
took home the biggest awards.
Funny how the biggest hits tend,
to suddenly become the best
music of the year- Eddie Ved-'
der summed it up best when,
upon receiving his Grammy in
1996, he said onstage: "I don't
know what this means. I don't
think it means anything."
And, in keeping with that bit
of skepticism for the moment,
how can anyone be so infatuat-
ed with Macklemore over Kend-
rick Lamar - especially in light
of that resounding performance
T1 f-VZ T

with Imagine Dragons. Best
New Artist has been a sham
since Bon Iver somehow man-
aged to sneak onto the ballot and
fun. beat out Frank Ocean, and
Kendrick Lamar shouldn't have
even been eligible in the first
place. But Best Rap Album? The
Heist was fine, if a bit poppy, but
even Macklemore thought Ken-
drick should've won, addressing
the rapper through Instagram:
"You got robbed. I wanted you
to win. You should have."
But whatever, I'm not bitter.
As overplayed and, yes, success-
ful as "Get Lucky" managed to
become, which of the other five
choices wasn't a pop blockbust-
er? At least "Get Lucky" 's win
rewarded an artist who's prov-
en their artistic ability over the
course of a career. I would've
been fine with "Royals," too,
but I was begrudgingly hoping
for Daft Punk - and Lorde won
a pretty big one anyway.
Also, just taking a quick look
at the Rock categories - what
decade are we in? Black Sab-
bath, who I watched for what
I assumed was a final show in
2012, snagged an award, along
with Paul McCartney, while the
Rolling Stones and David Bowie
found nominations elsewhere.
And what the hell, Best Rock
Album? Led Zeppelin beats out
Black Sabbath, David Bowie
and Kings of Leon - Queens of
the Stone Age is the only band
keeping me from bashing my
forehead into this table.
This was definitely a down
year for rock, j ut isn't it weird,
that, outside of a Lifetime
Achievement Award, Zep had'
never won a Grammy before?
And doesn't it feel a bit unnatu-
ral, that the album they finally
win for came out over three
decades after Led Zeppelin IV?
Let me admit something:
It's rare that I actually watch
the entire Grammy ceremony,
or even most of it. The best
highlights - the mishaps, the
newsworthy events, the block-

buster performances - are
always clipped and online in
a few minutes anyway, along
with the winners. Why wade
through the rest?
And in keeping with that, did
anyone else see the three-sec-
ond swing where Taylor Swift
went from thinking she'd won
her 8th Grammy, the coveted
Album of the Year, to the soul-
crushing realization of defeat?
The girl cannot catch a break -
guess she'll just have to go back
to the rest of her gramophone
statuettes.
Good Kid:
m.A.A.d
Grammys
Lastly, I enjoyed Mackl-
emore's performance of "Same
Love" - especially in that
opening segment, it can't be
easy breaking the silence of an
enormous concert hall with
just your voice and a soft piano
behind you. The mass marriage
was touching and, at the same
time, a bit unsettling - only in
imagining myself in the same
scenario.
All of these couples obviously
wanted to go through with this
in a way they saw as momentous
or beautiful, which I completely
support and understand. But
would I get married with 32
other couples, all at the same
time? I guess if Macklemore or
Madonna is singing at my wed-
ding, it couldn't be that bad, but
I might be selfish enough to
want the event centered around
me, when or if that day comes.
Elliot is still smashing his
head against the table. To help,

Poppn' ta ps n holes
Niit:' Am I stl watchng ths.?

By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
Daily Arts Writer
The best part of watching
slightly terrible TV shows is how
shrewd they make the viewer feel.
After binge-watching "The Good
Wife" over break, I was ready for
something less ... good. So when
Netflix recommended "Nikita," I
watched the have-handed trailer
try to stir mystery, drama and
good hair together. Itconly seemed
right for me to go down this rabbit
hole; bring it on.
Centered on Nikita (Maggie
Q, "Priest"), a rogue agent of the
shadowed government agency
Division, the show follows her and
her allies' attempts to bring down
Division. Nikita; we're shown
from the beginning, is a badass.
She goes through attack squads
sent by Division as if they were toy
soldiers.
Like her, these assassins were
picked from the prison system
for their lack of familial ties and
their low standing in society. They
were then brought to Division to
be trained as operatives, working
for their country to stop foreign
and domestic threats. But unlike
MI-6, the leaders of Division, cov-
ered by their secrecy, went astray
and started taking jobs for hire.
Enter Nikita, guns blazing, ready
to take out anyone and everyone
who was part of the dirty jobs.

DailyArts Writer
Over the last decade, we
said goodbye to Blockbuster,
VCRs and even DVDs, and we
lost our tendency to watch TV
shows with commercial breaks,
replacing those blocked evening
hours in our week with Satur-
days of Netflix binging. Because
of these shifts, major networks
are challenged to adapt. The
result has largely been greater
access to online streaming and
video on demand. FOX network
though, under the leadership
of Chairman of Entertainment
Kevin Reilly, is attempting a
new move altogether.
At the most recent Television
Critics Association press tour,
on Jan. 13, Reilly unveiled his
plan to skip pilot season this
year. This is a strategic move
intended to rebuild and revamp
what Reilly sees as an antiquat-
ed network calendar, with the
typical February to April pilot
production cycle. Instead, the
production and development
process will be on a year-round
time frame.
Well, what does this mean for
the industry? The answer is not
entirely clear. Pilot season has
been a definitive part of the TV
world, when production is put
on steroids. Every season about
70 pilot episodes are paraded for
TV execs in carnival fashion -
around 20 are ultimately picked
up. Finding actors, and good
ones at that, while testing con-
cepts and often half-developed
ideas, adds an enormous amount
of pressure to the process. Reil-
ly says, "It's nothing short of a

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Cold front washes
over the Midwest
causes road issues

Artic weather system
could lead to major
delays for commuters
CHICAGO (AP) -Anotherwin-
ter day, another below-zero high
temperature for many parts of the
Midwest - at least, it seems that
way. The deep chill has returned,
bringing with it wind chills rang-
ing from the negative teens to 40s,
school cancellations and sighs of
resignation from residents who
are weary of bundling up.
A persistent weather pattern
that's driving Arctic air south was
forecast to force temperatures
to plummet for about 21/2 days,
starting overnight Sunday. Actual
temperatures will range from the
teens in northern Kentucky to
double-digits below zero in Min-
nesota, but even colder wind chills
were expected - minus 43 in
Minneapolis, minus 23 in Chicago,
minus 18 in Dayton, Ohio, minus
14 in Kansas City, Mo., and minus
3 in Louisville, Ky.
Before sunrise Monday at a
24-hour drugstore in Omaha,
Neb., where wind chills were at
21 below, Amy Henry said she was
longing for warmer weather.
"I just look at my (apartment)
pool every day and say, 'Oh, come
on, summer,"' the 36-year-old
store clerk said.
National Weather Service
Meteorologist Scott Blair stopped
short of calling the latest round of
cold part of the polar vortex, a sys-
tem of winds that circulate around
the North Pole.
"There's really nothing abnor-
mal about the air that's coming
into the area," he said. "It's just
been a very persistent pattern" of
cold air.
Blair said it's an amplified pat-
tern of the jet stream, with cold air
filtering in behind a large trough
of low pressure. Simplifying, he
explained: "Troughs are typically
associated with unstable or unset-
tled weather, and, at this time of
the year, much colder air."
Frigid temperatures are expect-
ed to hold into Tuesday. If Chicago
makes it to 60 hours below zero, it

will be the longest stretch since
1983 - when it was below zero for
98 hours - and the third longest in
80 years.
"I'msick of it," Chicago resident
Matt Ryan, 19, said Sunday on his
way to his family's home in the
suburb of Oak Park. Chicago tem-
peratures are expected to peak at
a mere minus 4 degrees on Mon-
day with wind chills as low as 40
below.
Chicago Public Schools called
off Monday's classes for its nearly
400,000 students, as did suburban
districts. Earlier this month, when
it was below zero for 36 straight
hours, CPS closed for two days.
Amtrak canceled more than a
dozen trains into and out of Chi-
cago.
About 90 miles north of Chi-
cago, Ray Fournelle lamented the
weather's ability to keep him from
his normal routine of jogging 4
miles a couple of times a week.
During bad weather in the past,
the 72-year-old engineering pro-
fessor at Marquette University in
Milwaukee has walked instead.
But he hasn't tried to exercise
outside since last weekend. Mon-
day's forecast predicted a high of
5 below.
"With all the snow and ice
on the sidewalks, you just slide
around out there. It's just rotten,"
he said Sunday.
In the northern U.S., North
Dakota and South Dakota resi-
dents dealt with dangerous cold
and wind gusts Sunday that
reached up to 60 mph - blow-
ing snow to the point where it
was nearly impossible to travel
in some spots. On Monday, snow
drifts kept Interstate 29 closed
from Sioux Falls to the Canadian
border. In Indiana, where 50 mph
gusts were recorded early Mon-
day, officials recommended only
essential travel in more than half
of its counties.
In Michigan,which has in parts
experienced its snowiest January
on record, expressways closed as
snow and subfreezing tempera-
tures played a role in multiple
crashes Sunday; at least three peo-
ple died over the weekend because
of weather-related accidents.

As seen from the Rose Garden, President Barack Obama works at his desk in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Monday.
For Obama, State of the Union
pragmatic goals trump idealism

Administration seeks
to avoid mention of
sweeping reforms
WASHINGTON (AP) - No
longer about bold ambitions, this
year's State of the Union address
will focus more on what's actually
achievable.
For the White House, that
dose of realism is aimed at avoid-
ing a repeat of 2013, when a long
list of unfulfilled policy goals
- including gun control and an
immigration overhaul - dragged
President Barack Obama down
like an anchor. Tuesday's prime-
time address will focus instead
on redefining success for Obama
- not by what he can jam through
Congress but rather by what he
can accomplish through his own
presidential powers.
He is expected to announce
executive actions on job training,
retirement security and help for
the long-termunemployed in find-
ing work. All are part of the White
House focus this year on boosting
economic mobility and narrow-
ing the income gap between the
wealthy and the poor.
Another action Obama is

expected to announce is the cre-
ation of a new retirement sav-
ings plan geared toward workers
whose employers don't currently
offer such plans. Because com-
mercial retirement accounts
often have fees or high mini-
mum deposits that are onerous
for low-wage workers, this pro-
gram would allow first-time sav-
ers to start building up savings
in Treasury bonds. Once the sav-
ings grew large enough, a worker
could convert the account into
a traditional IRA, according to
two people who have discussed
the proposal with the admin-
istration. Those people weren't
authorized to discuss it ahead of
the announcement and insisted
on anonymity.
"Tomorrow night, it's time
to restore opportunity for all,"
Obama said Monday on the vid-
eo-sharing site Vine, part of the
White House's broad social media
promotion of the speech.
"I think the way we have to
think about this year is we have
a divided government," White
House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer
said. "The Republican Congress
is not going to rubber-stamp the
president's agenda. The president
is not going to sign the Republi-

can Congress' agenda."
The address, delivered before a
joint session of Congress and mil-
lions of Americans watching on
television and the Internet, typi-
cally garners a president his larg-
est audience of the year. It also
provides perhaps his best oppor-
tunity to try to persuade skepti-
cal Americans that he still wields
substantial power in Washington,
even if he can't break through a
divided Congress.
The risk for Obama in cen-
tering his agenda on his own
executive actions is that those
directives often are more lim-
ited in scope than legislation that
requires congressional approval.
And that raises questions about
how much impact he can have.
For example, Obama can col-
lect commitments from busi-
nesses to consider hiring the
long-term unemployed, as he'll
announce Tuesday night, but
without the help of Congress he
can't restore expired jobless ben-
efits for those Americans while
they look for work.
White House officials con-
tend executive actions should not
automatically be pegged as small
bore, pointing in particular to
steps the president can take on

climate change, including stricter
regulations on power plants and
new car efficiency standards.
And some Democrats are cheer-
ing the strategy, saying it's time
for Obama to look beyond Capi-
tol Hill after spending more than
half his time in office mired in
congressional gridlock.
"They spent far too much time
actuallytrying to think they could
negotiate with House and Senate
Republicans," said Jim Manley, a
longtime adviser to Senate Major-
ity Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. "I,
for one, am glad that they finally
decided to go around Congress to
the extent possible."
Not surprisingly, Republicans
have been dismissive of the presi-
dent's go-it-alone approach.
Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., suggest-
ed that some executive actions
might run up against legal chal-
lenges, saying Congress should
insist Obama "find the Constitu-
tion and follow it." And House
Speaker John Boehner's office
said the strategy was simply a
rehash of earlier Obama efforts
to focus on executive authority
when action in Congress stalled,
including a 2011 effort that the
White House branded, "We Can't
Wait."

Early groundwork
paves path for
statewide campaign
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Groups backing an increase
in Michigan's minimum wage
laid the groundwork Monday
for a statewide ballot drive in
November, forming a committee
that is very likely to commence
with collecting hundreds of
thousands of signatures needed
to qualify.
"Our politicians in Lansing
and D.C. have failed workers.
There are a lot of people who
work hard who've been waiting
for a raise," said Frank Houston,
treasurer of the Raise Michigan
ballot committee.
Michigan's $7.40-an-hour
minimum wage last went up
in 2008 and is slightly higher
than the $7.25 federal hourly
minimum. Republicans have not
embraced calls by both Presi-
dent Barack Obama and Michi-
gan Democrats to raise the
minimum wage to $10 at the fed-
eral and state levels. Democrats
are planning to make income
inequality a top issue this elec-
tion year.
"All indications are that we're
highly likely to move forward,"
said Houston, who also is chair-
man of the Oakland County
Democratic Party. "We fully
expect Michigan to be the No. 1
place in the country where we're
having a conversation around
economic dignity and inequal-
ity."
The coalition involved
includes labor unions, commu-

nity organizers, a restaurant
worker center, and faith-based
and civil rights groups. The
groups sent out statements
Monday from low-wage moth-
ers who said their income is not
enough to get by.
"If you work full-time you
shouldn't live in poverty," said
Rebecca Hatley-Watkins, 23, of
Kalamazoo.
A final decision to proceed is
expected within days. The pro-
posal would likely aim to change
a state statute, not change the
state constitution. The mini-
mum wage would rise to the
"ballpark" of between $9 and
$10.10 an hour and be indexed to
inflation, Houston said.
Republicans have said hik-
ing the minimum wage would
hurt employers' ability to hire
people. The restaurant industry
says it already operates on thin
margins and argues sharply
higher wages would lead to
steeper prices.
"If Michigan increases the
cost of employing entry-level
workers, lower-skilled work-
ers will see less job opportuni-
ties because employers will be
forced to hire higher-skilled job
applicants to fill multiple roles or
cut jobs to absorb the costs asso-
ciated with the increase," said
Wendy Block, director of health
policy and human resources for
the Michigan Chamber of Com-
merce.
The group said businesses
already are grappling with costs
associated with the federal
health care law and that govern-
ment should focus on helping
people get jobs, not make it more
expensive to hire them.

A 'big brother' and mentor away from home

By JUSTIN STERN
Daily Sports Writer
Bryan Mone and Sione Houma
are just like any other students
on the Ann Arbor campus.
They sit in their dorms in West
Quad, watching movies like
Catching Fire or playing Call of
Duty: Ghosts.
Their humble personalities
often serve as an invisible
cloak for their athletic abilities.
Their skills on the gridiron are
often hidden by their character.
However, it's that character
that makes them so close on
and off the field. The same
chemistry that once led the
Highland Rams to a Utah state
championship is now making a
comeback in Ann Arbor.
For Mone, an incoming
football recruit, and Houma,
currently a sophomore fullback,
protecting one another has
been apparent since the first
game they wore black and
white together on the Highland
High School football field in
Salt Lake City.
Currently spending his first
semester at Michigan this win-
ter, the standout lineman Mone
was recruited by high-profile
programs such as Alabama, Flor-
ida State and Stanford. When
Houma packed his bags for Ann
Arbor and left his hometown in
the summer of 2012, he always
remembered Mone, who consis-
tently made the key block lead-
ing to touchdowns. While Mone
was protecting Houma on the
field, Houma played Mone's "big
brother" off the field.
"Sione is an older brother to
me," Mone said. "He tells me
what I need to do and keeps my
head straight, and helps me out
a lot whether it be the recruiting
process or in the classroom."
In high school, the two hung
out in the hallways between
classes, walked out together
after practices or a game and
attended church together on a
weekly basis. During Mone's
senior year, he attended a
church retreat on a spiritual
trip to Sacramento, Calif. It
was this trip that finally put
him over the edge to make a
verbal commit to Michigan.


COURTESY OF MGOBLOG TERRA MOLLENGRAFF/Daily
Sophomore fullback Sione Houma didn't get to see much action on the field, but his relationsip with incoming recruit Bryan Mone was crucial to landing the lineman's committment to Michigan.

"For some reason Michigan
was in my head when ISwas there
praying about it," Mone said. "I
felt like that was a sign. It was
a spur of the moment kind of
thing. God brought me here to
Michigan."
It was just a week later after
the retreat that Michigan
received their second prized
recruit's verbal commitment
from Salt Lake City. The two
high-school teammates got to
resurrect their bond when Mone
told Highland High School foot-
ball coach Brody Benson that he
was committing to Michigan.
"(Mone and Houma) both
carry two strong characteristics
that make them stand out - a
caring personality and a strong
work ethic," Benson said. "That
is whatgotthem to the place they
are today."
On Aug. 1, 2012, Houma
officially enrolled at the
University. The time together
on the field vanished between
Houma and Mone, but their
friendship got stronger.
Still in high school, Mone

it's no surprise that he believes He has been forced to take
in the importance of creating care of his disabled older brother
special bonds with the players Filimone with his mother Sela
and coaches at his new Michigan his entire life. Filimone was

born with the inability to see,
speak or perform daily tasks
like feeding himself. He wears a
diaper, which is left up to Mone
to change. The battles Mone
faces on the football field are
pale in perspective to assisting
his brother every day.
"When I wake up each day,
I give him a shower or feed
him pills, change him," he said.
"That happens two times a day,
before I go to school and when I
come home.
"Taking care of my brother
and family is a lot more
rewarding than the recognition
I have received from football. I
play for my brother. Taking care
of my brother is like taking care
of my quarterback if I'm on the
offensive line. My lives on the
field and off the field are both
similar in many ways."
Mone finished his senior sea-
son with 41 tackles and 1.5 sacks,
while also being a student who
cares about his academics -
another reason he chose Michi-
gan. In his last semester of high
school, he received all A's. Yet

Houma tells him the challenges
will only be greater in Ann Arbor.
"At Michigan, Sione tells me to
stay on top of school. The most
important thing is managing
your time wisely," Mone said.
"You will have distractions, but
the main thing is to manage your
time and stay focused."
The rise of Mone's stock both
on the field and off is a reflection
of many people . in his life.
Through his humble attitude,
he remains poised and still
shocked that he's about to begin
playing football and attend the
University. From Coach Benson
pushing him in the weight room
to the inspiration from his older
brother, to the teachers in his
classrooms, Mone has been led
in the right direction.
However, when Mone depart-
ed for Michigan in early January,
it was the farthest he has ever
been from his family and life in
Salt Lake City. As he begins his
new chapter, he will always have
a reminder of where he came
from with "big brother" Sione
Houma by his side.


Wolverines emphasize blocking
shots in anticipation of Badgers

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Editor
Have you ever stopped a solid
rubber object flyingover 80 miles
per hour?
The answer, for most, is likely
no. But on Monday, the Michigan
hockey team didn't stop just one
object flying that fast. It practiced
doingso multiple times.
Albeit the now 12th-ranked
Wolverines never fired shots at
full strength, usinghbright orange
plastic balls to mimic the action
without risking injury, but the
message still stood. Blocking
shots will be a priority this
weekend when No. 9 Wisconsin
comes to Yost Ice Arena.
"It's about having the proper
form when you go down," said
junior forward Zach Hyman.
"But it is repetition, getting feel
for how to get in front of the
defenseman in front of the lane."
Michigan's style is a little bit
different from the traditional
form used across several pro-
grams. Instead of lying on their
stomachs with their arms and
legs extended, the Wolverines
bend to one knee and approach
the shooter. They lower their
sticks and keep

to its ability to block shots. Michi-

Against Michigan State last
week, the Wolverines showed
improvement in limiting the
number of open looks and shots
that found their way to the
net. Michigan finished with 38
blocked shots last weekend, when
it swept the Spartans.
Senior defenseman Mac Ben-
nett remains the team's leader in
blocked shots with 36 this season,
but it's forwards JT Compher and
Derek DeBlois who face a greater
burden. The pair ranks at the

top in blocked shots for the Wol-
verines, but have a larger area to
cover in front of the net.
Even Michigan coach Red
Berenson got involved in the
action, demonstrating to his
players from time to time. On
several occasions, Berenson sat

him from having his voice

While being on the bench
has its advantages over being

instances where watching the

abode may be better. Like, for
instance, when having to deal
with opposing teams fans.
"It was pretty bad still,"
McGary said about dealing
with hecklers at the Breslin
