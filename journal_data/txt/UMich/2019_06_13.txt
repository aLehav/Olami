Secretary of 
State introduces 
college-age voter 
initatives 

On June 5, Secretary of State 
Jocelyn 
Benson 
announced 
several initiatives designed to 
encourage participation among 
student and college-age voters, 
including the strikedown of a 
current law requiring some first-
time voters to vote in person.
The changes come from a 
settlement meant to resolve a 
lawsuit brought forth by the 
University of Michigan’s chapter 
of 
College 
Democrats 
and 
other student groups alleging 
Michigan’s 
voting 
regulations 
unconstitutionally 
disfranchise 
younger voters.
“Going away to school shouldn’t 
complicate a student’s ability to 
vote,” Benson said. “Michigan 
has made great strides recently 
in improving access for all voters, 
and this is just the beginning of 
our work to ensure college-age 
voters have the information and 

opportunities they need to vote as 
engaged citizens.”
In late August 2018, College 
Democrats 
at 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
Michigan 
State 
University, Northern Michigan 
University and the Michigan 
Federation of College Democrats, 
with support from the Democratic 
Congressional 
Campaign 
Committee, filed a lawsuit against 
then-Secretary of State Ruth 
Johnson and Bureau of Elections 
Director Sally Williams.
According to the plaintiff’s press 
release, the lawsuit addresses two 
Michigan’s 
voter 
registration 
and ID laws, Michigan Public 
Act 118 and Michigan Compiled 
Laws 168.509t(2). The former 
law said the listed residence on 
a voter’s driver license and voter 
registration card must match, 
while the latter requires voters 
who register by mail or through 
a third-party voter registration 
drive to cast their first ballot 
in-person.
The plaintiffs, represented by 
Perkins Coie LLP and MSU law 
professor Mark Totten, allege 
the two laws discourage college-
age individuals from voting by 
unnecessarily complicating the 
process and making it more time-
consuming.
“(Y)oung voters in Michigan 
have 
faced 
unequal 
and 
consequential 
barriers 
in 

registering to vote and voting for 
the first time,” the complaint read. 
“Indeed, in many cases, these 
laws have resulted in a chilling 
effect that has kept eligible young 
voters in Michigan from voting 
and registering to vote entirely 
due to widespread confusion 
about the laws’ requirements and 
legal effects.”
In particular, plaintiffs claim 
the 
“First-Time/In-Person” 
requirement 
deter 
first-time 
student voters who have moved 
considerable distances to attend 
college or university, as they 
would need to return to their 
home precincts to cast their 
ballots.
After the lawsuit was filed, 
Michigan 
residents 
voted 
to 
adopt Proposal 3 during the 2018 
midterm election. Among other 
changes to Michigan’s election 
laws, Proposal 3 permits voters 
to cast an absentee ballot without 
providing a reason.
According 
to 
Benson’s 
announcement, 
she 
will 
be 
overturning Michigan Compiled 
Laws 168.509t(2) requiring first-
time voters to vote in-person, as 
allowing for no-reason absentee 
voting means the requirement 
is 
no 
longer 
constitutionally 
enforceable. 

Court-ordered 
meeting with 
Schlissel, ‘U’ 
reps delayed

Court of Appeals judge 
postpones settlement 
conference until 
further notice

Sixteen hours before University of 
Michigan President Mark Schlissel was 
expected at U.S. District Court in Detroit 
for a settlement conference as part of the 
lawsuit Doe v. University of Michigan, 
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 
released an order on Wednesday night 
postponing the meeting until further 
notice. The order grants an emergency 
motion for stay filed by University 
lawyers early Wednesday morning, 
which only asks the meeting be delayed.
The 
order 
gives 
the 
Court 
of 
Appeals time to review the merits of an 
emergency petition — filed at the same 
time as the motion — requesting the 
meeting be held without Schlissel and 
off the record. The Court of Appeals 
noted it may deny the requests of the 
petition without an answer.
In an email to The Daily, University 
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald wrote 
that University officials — including 
Schlissel — were prepared to attend 
a private settlement conference this 
Thursday. Fitzgerald also wrote that 
the University confirmed with court 
clerks on May 24 the meeting would 
be private, which he claimed is “a 
normal 
expectation 
for 
settlement 
conferences.”
However, learning Tuesday morning 
District Court Judge Arthur Tarnow 
had ordered the meeting be held in 
open court instead, University lawyers 
filed two emergency requests, a step 
Fitzgerald called “extraordinary.”

Scientists receive 
flu research grant

$34.3 million will be 
used to develop 
more effective 
vaccines

A 
team 
of 
international 
scientists 
secured 
a 
$34.3 
million, seven-year grant from 
the National Institute of Allergy 
and 
Infectious 
Diseases 
for 
their international research on 
influenza, 
commonly 
known 
as the flu. The team includes 
Aubree Gordon, University of 
Michigan assistant professor of 
epidemiology, and Paul Thomas, 
professor at St. Jude Children’s 
Research Hospital.
Gordon 
said 
her 
group’s 
research could provide more data 
to create better flu vaccines and 
lead to new insights into immune 
system responses.
“I was incredibly excited, and 
it took a little while to sink in,” 

Gordon said. “I think vaccines 
are one of the best tools that we 
have to improve global health. 
I think this grant in particular 
may have broader impacts as 
I think it will provide insight 
into the development of the 
immune system in addition to our 
influenza-specific findings.”
The seven-year observational 
study will consist of a team 
of 
international 
experts 
in 
immunology and virology, two 
new cohorts in California and 
New Zealand and one existing 
cohort 
in 
Nicaragua. 
Each 
location has different flu seasons 
and vaccination rates, with rates 
being highest in Los Angeles and 
lowest in Nicaragua. Gordon 
believes each area may have 
different strains of influenza, so 
the vaccines may be different.
The 
three 
locations 
could 
help determine if immunity is 
affected by different flu seasons in 
different hemispheres.

State Rep. 
announces bill to 
forbid styrofoam in 
Michigan 

On Friday afternoon, state 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 
announced a bill to ban most 
single-use polystyrene foam at 
a press conference in Bandemer 
Park on the shore of the Huron 
River. Rabhi was joined by 
members 
of 
Environment 
Michigan, the state-level muscle 
of 
environmental 
advocacy 
group Environment America.
“Single-use polystyrene, as 
was stated, is such a scourge of 
our environment,” Rabhi said. 
“It impacts our waterways and 
it impacts the environments 
that we all love. We’re standing 
here on the banks of the Huron 
River in beautiful Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, on a gorgeous sunny 
day, and all around us there are 
people enjoying this beautiful 
asset in our community. The 
worst thing that could happen 
is if we continue to allow 
those polystyrene, single-use 
containers to be used and then 
not recycled and thrown into 
our waterways.”
Rabhi’s bill would ban the 
use of unenclosed polystyrene 
foam — commonly referred to as 
styrofoam — at the state level, 
with exceptions for medical, 

veterinary 
and 
research 
purposes. 
Small 
businesses 
could also be exempt from 
the law if the business can 
prove there are no reasonable 
alternatives.
This 
legislation 
is 
associated with a companion 
bill which would earmark 
revenue from violations of 
Rabhi’s bill to a state fund 
promoting clean water and 
mitigating plastic pollution. 
The companion bill is being 
introduced by state Rep. Jim 
Haadsma, 
D-Battle 
Creek, 
who Rabhi said was a leader 
on this issue, though meetings 
in his district kept him from 
attending the event.
Environment 
Michigan 
Director 
Nathan 
Murphy 
thanked Rabhi and Haadsma 
for their work and said single-
use plastics like styrofoam are 
not worth the harm they cause 
to wildlife and water bodies.
“We need to ban single-
use convenience plastics like 
styrofoam, which is one of 
the worst offenders,” Murphy 
said. “These bills will make a 
real difference for our waters 
and our water life.”
A study from the Rochester 
Institute of Technology found 
22 million pounds of plastic 
debris enter the Great Lakes 
every year from the U.S. and 
Canada and plastic accounts 
for approximately 80 percent 
of the Great Lakes shorelines.

Though the future of 
affirmative action remains in 
question, pre-med students 
are decisive: According to a 
Kaplan survey of over 245 
pre-med students, 80 per-
cent agreed it is important 
for the American medical 
profession to be demograph-
ically representative of the 
general patient population.
Kaplan’s survey comes in 
the wake of an April deci-
sion by Texas Tech Univer-
sity to no longer use race 
or national origin as a part 
of their holistic medical 
school application process. 
The decision finalized the 
14-year investigation into a 
complaint against the school 
stating the use of race in the 
admissions process is in vio-
lation of Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. Current-
ly, eight states have a ban on 
affirmative action — includ-
ing 
Michigan. 
Together, 
these eight states educate 
about 29 percent of all U.S. 
high school students.
For the University of 
Michigan’s 2018 school of 
medicine class, 20 percent 
are categorized by the Uni-

versity as “underrepresented 
in medicine.” According to 
second-year medical student 
Zoe Curry this relatively low 
number is a hindrance to 
change.
“It seems that this num-
ber is actually higher than 
the national average too, 
which is a reality that I and 
many of my classmates find 
unsettling,” Curry said. “A 
lot of my concern centers on 
the culture of medicine as a 
whole, and how hard it is to 
challenge traditional struc-
tures of teaching and assess-
ment that don’t take issues of 
diversity into account.”
In a different Kaplan 
survey, 
medical 
school 
admissions officers graded 
themselves on recruiting and 
admitting students from dif-
ferent backgrounds. Nearly 
88 percent of admissions 
officers graded themselves 
with “A,” “B” or “C,” while 
only about five percent went 
so low as “D” or “F.”
Steven Gay, assistant dean 
of admissions at the Univer-
sity Medical School, told The 
Daily he was unable to give 
the school a diversity grade 
as the goal for greater diver-
sity is constantly evolving.
“Our goal is to bring in 

a class that has most spe-
cial medical students in the 
country,” Gay said. “One of 
the core tenants of that being 
the best group of young phy-
sicians is their diversity on 
any level. Whether it comes 
from 
socioeconomics, 
to 
their extensive and profound 
experiences, to the distance 
that they travel, to the things 
that they inspire to do. One 
of the things that is actu-
ally very clear, shooting for 
a specific GPA and MCAT 
score does very, very little 
to guarantee you a class that 
will fulfill the goals and the 
vision of the institution … I 
don’t think it’s something 
that I will ever be able to sit 
back to say, ‘See, we did it.’”
Though the number of 
Black men earning col-
lege degrees has grown, 
the number of Black men 
entering medical schools is 
smaller in 2015 compared 
to 1978, with 1,410 in 1978 
and only 1,337 in 2015. For 
Gay, this low number of 
African Americans pur-
suing medicine does not 
come as a surprise. With 
a lack of opportunity and 
exposure, Gay said unrep-
resented minority students 
will not consider medicine 

as a career path.
“Simply put, you’re see-
ing few African American 
males in our college as 
well,” Gay said. “I think the 
number one reason is that 
opportunities and equity 
have become much more 
difficult in our society for a 
number of different classes 
of people.”
David J. Brown, asso-
ciate vice president and 
associate dean for Health 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion, 
agrees with Gay that there 
are 
numerous 
barriers 
that both restrict and dis-
courage 
unrepresented 
minorities from applying 
to medical school.
“It starts early in the 
academic development of 
Black males with uncon-
scious biases from negative 
stereotypes in the media, 
low-resourced 
schools, 
advisors who do not recog-
nize their talents and dis-
courage or redirect them 
from studying medicine, 
the lack of Black male phy-
sician role models and at 
times, the lack of financial 
resources,” Brown said.

“Thank you for giving us 
the opportunity to serve you 
for the past 32 years,” read 
the white and red sign placed 
in the window of one of Ann 
Arbor’s oldest Chinese res-
taurants, China Gate. The 
restaurant located at 1201 S. 
University closed their doors 
for the very last time on Mon-
day, May 27.
The popular Asian eatery 
began serving classic dishes 
such as chicken lo mein, 
szechuan pork and sweet and 
sour chicken in 1987 under 
acclaimed “Chef Jan,” with 
most of the original serving 
staff remaining with the res-
taurant until its closing. For 
less than $15, students and 
local residents alike could 
enjoy a filling meal accompa-
nied by a selection of ’80s hits 
playing in the background.
Many 
students 
initially 
became aware of China Gate’s 
closing after a post was made 
on the Facebook page “Over-
heard at Umich.” There are 
almost 500 comments and 
800 reactions attributed to 
the post.
“Horrible news, Wolver-
ines,” the post said. “After 32 
years, China Gate will be clos-
ing permanently at the end of 
May.”
University 
of 
Michigan 
alum 
LeAnne 
Wintrode 
remembered spending much 
of her time there, citing 
China Gate as one of the more 
affordable 
restaurants 
on 
campus.
“I have so many memories 

of life events that are tied to 
eating there, and I feel very 
nostalgic for the first time in 
my life when I was a regu-
lar there,” Wintrode said. “I 
had several first dates there, 
because, as a poor college stu-
dent, I couldn’t afford ‘fancy’ 
restaurants in Ann Arbor, but 
I could eat at China Gate and 
feel like a grown-up … With 
China Gate closing, I’m losing 
an eatery, but more impor-
tantly, I feel like I am losing 
my memories.”
According to sign posted in 
the window of China Gate, the 
restaurant’s closing was due 
to a proposed redevelopment 
resulting in the termination 
of China Gate’s lease. Owner 
Melissa Jan told MLive she 
was not expecting her lease’s 
renewal application to be 
denied.
“We asked for renewal, but 
our landlord informed us that 
unfortunately based on their 
current redevelopment plans, 
that they will not be renewing 
our lease,” Jan said. “We were 
kind of surprised at first.”
The 
developer, 
Hughes 
Properties, is planning demo-
lition of the entire 1000 block 
of South University to put up 
a 13-story apartment complex 
of “prestigious luxury student 
housing” called Vic Village 
South. Earlier this year, the 
company 
constructed 
the 
12-story apartment complex 
Vic Village North, located 
along the north side of South 
University, featuring over 57 
apartments with 261 beds for 
a monthly rate between $975 
to $1,700.

O

n May 16, the series 
finale of “The Big Bang 
Theory” aired. I didn’t 
have time to catch it, nor would 
I have had the ability to follow 
along, as I haven’t properly 
followed 
the 
show 
since 
high school. “The Big Bang 
Theory” — plot aside — was an 
interesting show. I always sort 
of saw it as the TV version of 
President Richard Nixon — no 
one knew anyone who voted 
for Nixon yet he won back to 
back landslides. I don’t know 
many people who advertise the 
fact they watch “The Big Bang 
Theory” and yet it ran for over 
a decade.
Still, once it occurred to 
me that this was truly the 
last hurrah for the cast, I will 
admit to feeling slightly sad, 
not because of what the show 
was, but because of what it 
meant to me. I used to watch 
it in high school, and started 
doing so after a friend of mine 
mentioned his sister worked on 
the show as a writer. “The Big 
Bang Theory,” to me, was less 
about the adventures of Sheldon 
and Penny and more about the 
fact that it was a core part of 
my Thursday night ritual. My 
mom usually worked late, and 
my sister was at the University 
of San Diego, so I was already 
doing dinner by myself one day a 
week. “The Big Bang Theory” fit 
in very nicely in that it enabled 
me to break the steady sounds of 
my eating reheated ravioli.

In those days, I would go to 
my dad’s house every other 
weekend, so after he would pick 
me up on Friday from school 
and take me home, we’d usually 
rewatch “The Big Bang Theory” 
with a bowl of hot Cheeto Puffs 
and a glass of ice-cold Coca-
Cola. 
The 
aforementioned 
friend (as well as many, many 
others) was always willing 
to watch that show with me 
during tutorial in high school, 
but it has been a while since I’ve 
been a real fan. 
I’m going to be a senior in 
college and the last time I 
watched a full season as it aired 
rather than binging it in a day 
was when I was in high school, 
and the last time I sat and 
actually paid attention to a full 
episode was on a plane. So then 
why did I care that it was over? 
More than anything else, 
“The Big Bang Theory” ending 
was yet another thread from my 
past being closed off. I know that 
we can’t live in our memories, 
but it is always nice to have 
something tangible connecting 
us to the past. TV played a role 
in my childhood — I remember 
watching shows with friends, 
but a lot of those have ended and 
we are stuck with reruns, which 
seems like a solid parable of the 
times. Now, when I come home 
for summer expecting to make 
new memories with my friends, 
not many of them come back 
at all. So I’m stuck watching 
reruns and imagining things as 

they once were.
A lot of the shows that I used 
to watch with my friends in high 
school have ended for good — 
“Parks and Rec,” “The Office,” 
“Outsourced,” 
“How 
I 
Met 
Your Mother” and now, finally, 
“The Big Bang Theory.” I can’t 
say I’m unhappy about this — 
I would rather they end with 
dignity rather than needing 
to be taken out back and shot 
between the eyes. But it is still 
a bit surreal to know that your 
entire TV schedule from only 
a few years now exists only in 
your memories.
“The 
Big 
Bang 
Theory” 
represented a consistency to 
me which is something that 
only happened because of how 
long it was on the air for. It was 
one unbroken thread weaving 
through high school, family 
drama and college success, as 
well as failure. It tied me to my 
past, for better or worse, and 
was there for me when I needed 
it. When I transferred to a new 
school and had no friends to 
eat dinner with, I always knew 
Sheldon and Leonard would 
be down for Thai (even if it 
was from No Thai instead of 
Siam Palace). But eventually, 
I needed them less and less 
as I made new friends, and it 
couldn’t have ended at a better 
time. Thanks for all the laughs, 
and laugh tracks.

Saying goodbye to ‘The Big Bang Theory’

t’s June and anyone in or arouund 
the LGBTQ+ community knows 
that it is Pride Month. Our social 
media feeds, Uber apps and college 
campuses become more rainbow-col-
ored and we hear a bit more from our 
favorite queer celebrities, politicians 
and friends.
But Pride is about more than 
retweeting a few Pride-related tweets 
and stories. It’s about more than order-
ing a pair of rainbow spandex and a 
sports bra for Pride and posing with 
your queer friend. It’s even about more 
than supporting your LGBTQ+ friends.
Please don’t get me wrong. We 
appreciate your support. But being an 
ally is about more than going to a Pride 
parade once a year. Your participation 
in Pride shouldn’t be confined only 
to June; Pride is for every month. It’s 
about recognizing what continues to 
hold back the LGBTQ+ community and 
helping to mitigate those problems.

Riots, this month celebrates the incred-
ible resilience, determination, diver-
sity and of course pride of the LGBTQ+ 
community. Pride celebrates where the 
community is today, but even more so 
it honors the sacrifice and dedication of 
those who preceded us and have paved 
the way for the rights we now have. 
Pride month is intended to set aside 
time for everyone — not just LGBTQ+ 
people — to reflect on history and cel-
ebrate progress. It is about recogniz-
ing that, despite accomplishments the 
community has made, there are still 
important strides to be taken.
It’s easy to forget that much of the 
progress the LGBTQ+ community has 
achieved has been extremely recent. 
Attitudes on same-sex marriage shift-
ed at unprecedented rates in America 
with increased visibility of LGBTQ+ 
individuals in social and celebrity cir-
cles. In 2004, only 31 percent of Ameri-
cans supported gay marriage. By 2017, 
public support skyrocketed to 62 per-
cent (it dropped down to 61 percent in 
2019, representing the first decrease in 
public support since 2009).
Furthermore, public opinion among 
college students and the rest of the 
country — specifically older, rural and 
conservative Americans — differs dras-
tically, as perceptions of queer normal-
ization and acceptance skew liberally 
in places like Ann Arbor. The accep-
tance we see in our day-to-day lives as 
students is uncharacteristic of the rest 
of the country. As of 2019, only 44 per-
cent of Republicans support gay mar-
riage (up from 19 percent in 2004, but 
down from 47 percent in 2017). Even 
among Democrats, only 75 percent 
favor gay marriage (up from 43 percent 
from 2004, and down from 76 percent 

in 2017, following the pattern of slightly 
declining support in recent years). 
Broadly speaking, support for LGBTQ+ 
individuals is stronger in urban areas, 
but falls behind in rural areas.
Ann Arbor is wonderfully accepting 
of members of the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity, earning an 100 on the Municipal 
Equality Index, the Human Rights 
Campaign’s review and subsequent 
rating of a city’s municipal laws, poli-
cies and services for LGBTQ+ resi-
dents. Living in a place like Ann Arbor, 
discrimination feels far removed from 
our lives, with the blame often falling 
wholly on the far-right. But it’s defi-
nitely not just about the radical con-
servatives we read about. In fact, the 
average score for the nation is 55 and 
the average score for Michigan is still 
only 69. Concerns about the highly con-
centrated population of liberal wealthy 
academics in Ann Arbor are entirely 
valid. However, communities where 
non-heteronormative 
lifestyles 
are 
normalized and respected, and where 
members of the LGBTQ+ community 
can live and work free of discrimina-
tion, are not actually so common, even 
in 2019. 
The majority of states still do not 
have protections against discrimina-
tion on the basis of sexual orientation 
or gender identity in the workplace, 
public accommodation and hous-
ing. Many states protect religious 
freedom over sexual identity, legally 
allowing refusal of service based on 
religious beliefs against homosexual-
ity. Transphobia continues to thrive 
in America, especially with the 
recent onslaught of transphobic pol-
icy from the Trump administration.
Don’t stop posting your Insta-
gram stories. Don’t stop retweet-
ing the ACLU. Don’t stop going to 
Pride. But if you do, don’t stop when 
June ends. Educate yourself on the 
issues that impact LGBTQ+ Ameri-
cans. Support your queer friends 
— beyond just posting pictures with 
them at a parade one Sunday a year. 
Learn about their experiences with 
discrimination. Go beyond vocally 
supporting queer lifestyles: make 
an active effort to normalize them. 
Identify your pronouns. If you can, 
donate to organizations that support 
LGBTQ+ rights. Organizations like 
the ACLU, Human Rights Campaign 
and Planned Parenthood are great, 
but there are a plethora of organi-
zations that do terrific work. And 
please, tell your local frat bro to stop 
saying, “That’s gay,” because it’s not 
2007 anymore.

Pride is more than a parade

I

sn’t that headline so ironic, 
given that our president gained 
so much immediate coverage 
and support because he is, in fact, 
a celebrity? I know that we have 
had 
celebrity-politicians 
before, 
including but not limited to Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Ronald Rea-
gan. If Donald Trump and Ronald 
Reagan aren’t two great examples 
of why we shouldn’t put celebrities 
in office, we clearly have some dis-
agreements to work through, but 
that’s not what this column is about. 
What about how we celebritize pol-
iticians after they enter office?
With the rise of social media, 
and the exploitation of it by politi-
cians desperate to capture young 
audiences, politicians are being 
viewed more as quasi-celebrities 
than public servants. In my own 
memory, this started during the 
Obama administration, and has 
only gotten worse. This treatment 
is dangerous — celebrity worship 
makes it more difficult to hold peo-
ple accountable, or to view them in 
an objective light. Take Obama for 
example: He is viewed (at least by 
Democrats) as the model president, 
the perfect politician. His likeness 
has been used in countless memes 
and novelty t-shirts, and during his 
presidency he appeared on many 
late-night shows. And while I do 
believe he was a good president, no 
president or politician will ever be 
perfect; in fact, Obama had a lot to 
be held accountable for that was 
glossed over in Saturday Night Live 
skits and silly merchandise.
Going into the 2020 election, this 
trend continues. One doesn’t need 
to be reminded how celebritized 
Trump is with his overdone rallies, 
infamous hats and tweeting tenden-
cies — and it’s not doing this country 
any good. With Trump’s amplified 
platform we’ve seen violent racist 
protests, a nationwide rise in hate 
crimes and horrific treatment of 
women and immigrants.
Trump is an extreme example 
of demagoguery given respect, but 
celebritizing politicians is a prob-
lem on the Democratic side, too, 
albeit on a less dangerous scale. 
We have presidential candidates on 
the cover of magazines and getting 
fashion advice from reporters. The 
people who will make decisions 
on war, healthcare, gun control 
and immigration are getting their 
crowd sizes compared like two pop 
stars on dueling world tours. 
Taking away the cultural lens of 
viewing politicians and political 
candidates is a double-edged sword. 

On one hand, conversations will be 
more policy-driven and maybe we 
can finally stop talking about who 
is more “likable” and start talking 
about who is least likely to ruin this 
country further. Yet on the other 
hand, popular media is a more 
accessible route to Americans, as 
not everyone wants to sit down and 
listen to Wolf Blitzer, but many peo-
ple will tune into Jimmy Fallon or 
Stephen Colbert.
So where does the burden fall? 
Is it on the media to stop treating 
politicians like celebrities, or is it 
on us? The responsibility truly lies 
with both. Stop inviting politicians 
on sketch comedy or talk shows 
and using that opportunity to play 
silly games or tousle their hair. 
And if you must have them, at least 
grill them a little bit. Don’t be their 
free advertisement — these politi-
cians are there to serve you, not the 
other way around.
As for us, the people, let’s make an 
effort to hold our elected officials 
and political hopefuls accountable, 
to view them through an objective 
lens. It is easy to get swept up in 
the excitement of politics — as a 
Public Policy student, I know this 
too well. You want to idolize these 
people, people who are in a posi-
tion you dream of being in, passing 
legislation you’ve fought for. But no 
political job should be guaranteed, 
and approval from constituents 
should be earned through good 
actions rather than likable, care-
fully planned interactions.
Washington 
already 
comes 
across as an exclusive place. The 
government that is supposed to be 
working for us is instead hiding 
behind free Smithsonian admis-
sion and chipper Congressional 
tours. It is natural to get excited 
when Elizabeth Warren calls you 
on the phone or Obama surprises 
the crowd on stage. But keep in 
mind that these are things that 
these politicians should be doing 
— we gave them their job, so they 
owe us their time. The exclusiv-
ity of politics only leads to closed 
doors and lackluster responses to 
real concerns and questions. If 
Congress won’t implement term 
limits, the American people can. 
Celebrities are celebrities for a rea-
son — there will never be another 
Bowie or Beyoncè. But the country 
is never going to run out of oppor-
tunistic politicians with a pocket-
ful of empty promises.

Stop treating politicians like celebrities

I

t is not often I wrap 
myself in the flag or get 
misty-eyed with patriotic 
sentiment. Perhaps this is 
because, as a history major, 
it is easy to get lost in the 
doom and gloom of most U.S. 
history classes. Or perhaps I 
am simply cynical by nature; I 
hope this is not the case — but 
maybe. In full awareness of 
this country’s missteps over 
the last two centuries — some 
of them egregious — I believe 
there are some moments when 
we can hold our heads high 
and proudly call ourselves 
Americans.
Now, as a member of The 
Daily, I also have great pride 
in this newspaper and the 
people with whom I work. 
Unfortunately, there was a 
grave oversight in last week’s 
edition: Not one word was 
written in the memory of the 
finest men who ever called 
themselves Americans — on 
the 75th anniversary of their 
sacrifice, no less. I was disap-
pointed to learn the stories 
that were published instead 
concerned only the political 
sticking points of 2019 — the 
issues which, by their nature, 
divide us. And so, knowing 
full well from the start that 
my efforts will be insuffi-
cient, I commit my humble 
talents to correct this mistake 
and honor both the sacrifices 
and triumphs of the men who 
fought and fell three-quarters 
of a century ago.
On June 6, 1944, Allied forc-
es, composed largely of Amer-
ican, British and Canadian 
troops, landed on the beach-
es of Normandy in northern 
France. Men plunged them-
selves into the raging, cold 
seas of the English Channel 
and marched headlong into a 

hailstorm of bullets. This was 
D-Day, the beginning of the 
end of World War II. It was 
because of this first assault 
that Allied forces were able to 
gain a foothold in continen-
tal Europe, liberate France, 
push into Germany and finally 
defeat Adolf Hitler.
I give this brief account of 
the Second World War because 
that war’s significance cannot 
be overstated. It was this war 
that brought down Hitler’s 
Germany and allowed a new 
age of freedom to take root, 
not just in Europe, but around 
the world. When the dust set-
tled, Nazi death camps were 
destroyed, fascism had fallen 
and the swastika lay atop a 
pile of rubble once meant to be 
the foundation of a 1,000-year 
reign.

I am not saying today’s 
politics are unimportant and 
should not be discussed. They 
should be. What I am saying is 
this: The memory of the men 
who brought down the Third 
Reich deserves our fullest 
devotion to preserving and 
improving the nation they died 
for. However, we cannot do 
this if we lose sight of our his-
tory and emphasize only the 
things which separate us. We 
are the heirs of a great inheri-
tance, and we should endeavor 

to deserve that inheritance by 
building on the foundation our 
forefathers lay — a foundation 
of liberty, equality and unity. 
In spite of our differences, 
we share this history and we 
share a future.
If nothing else, remember 
this: The freedoms we do not 
yet possess pale in compari-
son to the freedoms we cur-
rently enjoy. While we cry for 
that more perfect union, we 
must remember it will never 
be perfect, but it is good. It 
was good when it was con-
ceived. It was good when 
our soldiers fought their way 
across the beaches. It is good 
now. But we can make it bet-
ter. The torch has been passed 
to us, and we cannot allow 
this American experiment to 
fail after so much has been 
dedicated to its success. As 
we press on into the future, 
we must carry our history 
forward with us. If we do not, 
we will have failed before we 
have even begun.
And so, I leave you with the 
same commission that was 
given by Abaraham Lincoln 
at another field where Ameri-
cans fought and died for what 
they believed this country 
was and for what it could be:
“It is for us the living, rath-
er, to be dedicated here to the 
unfinished work which they 
who fought here have thus far 
so nobly advanced … That we 
here highly resolve that these 
dead shall not have died in 
vain — that this nation, under 
God, shall have a new birth 
of freedom — and that gov-
ernment of the people, by the 
people, for the people, shall 
not perish from the earth.”

No TV show addresses pain in all 
its forms quite like HBO’s “Big Lit-
tle Lies.” In fact, deep physical and 
emotional distress plays such a large 
part in the show that it’s almost its 
own character. In Monterey, Cali-
fornia, pain permeates. It lingers. It 
digs deep into the skin of the women 
it afflicts, making itself known in 
every aspect of their lives. 
As we come to understand in 
Season 1, our five main characters, 
Madeline 
(Reese 
Witherspoon, 
“Wild”), Celeste (Nicole Kidman, 
“Lion”), Renata (Laura Dern, “The 
Tale”), Jane (Shailene Woodley, 
“The Spectacular Now”) and Bon-
nie (Zoë Kravitz, “Mad Max: Fury 
Road”) are no strangers to suffering. 
What on the surface was a generic 
whodunit crime story was elevated 
to a refreshingly empathetic exami-
nation of sexual assault, domestic 
abuse and many other ways people 
hurt each other, largely due to the 
talent of its cast and the excellence 
of its writing. 
Season 1 pretty much covered the 
gist of the Liane Moriarty novel the 
show is based on, culminating in the 
murder of Celeste’s abusive husband 
and Jane’s rapist Perry (Alexander 
Skarsgård, “True Blood”), a murder 
that was for the most part a group 
effort performed by all five central 
women. “Big Little Lies” could have 
easily concluded here — that was the 
original plan, after all. 
Nevertheless, we’ve been given 
a second season. After watching its 
first episode, I’m so grateful we have. 

It turns out that, at least under the 
supervision of the geniuses behind 
the first season, the aftermath of the 
central drama is equally, if not even 
more compelling than the central 
drama itself. 
This “aftermath” manifests itself 
in Season 2 through the grief and 
guilt the Monterey Five are expe-
riencing following Perry’s death, a 
death they’ve told the authorities 
was a complete accident. They’re 
all trying their hardest to move on, 
some doing a better job than others, 
but none of them actually can — at 
least not completely. 

Each woman has her own reasons 
for her inability to move on from the 
past. Celeste, while partially grate-
ful to have an abuser out of her and 
her sons’ lives, is also struggling to 
part with the man she once loved so 
entirely and so passionately. The fact 
that her mother-in-law Mary Louise, 
played by the beloved Meryl Streep 
(“The Post”), has established her-
self in Monterey to look for answers 
regarding her son’s death certainly 
doesn’t help. 
Bonnie, a woman characterized in 
Season 1 by her seeming perfection 
and perpetual vitality, is in a similar 

state of ruin. In an intentional allu-
sion to Jane’s angst-filled jogs from 
Season 1, we see Bonnie on a run, 
looking more miserable than ever. If 
any of the Monterey women seems 
to have healed the most it’s Jane, but 
by the end of the episode we come 
to know that even she hasn’t quite 
forgotten about Perry. We’re shown 
a portrait of him she finds herself 
drawing, the face of her rapist, a face 
that can never be erased from her 
memory. 
Clearly, “Big Little Lies” wants us 
to know that all five women are in 
distress, just as they were in Season 
1. However, the Season 2 premiere 
adds an entirely new dimension 
to their pain by letting us observe 
how it travels between them. The 
distribution of pain has shifted, with 
Bonnie and Mary Louise now here 
to take a large portion of it away 
from Jane. In a particularly mov-
ing sequence, we see Jane dancing 
next to the ocean to Sufjan Stevens’s 
“Mystery of Love,” a song which 
could not be more different from 
the angry, heartbreaking Martha 
Wainwright song she so frequently 
listened to back in Season 1. With the 
burden of Perry’s existence off her 
chest, Jane is practically floating, in 
a beautiful moment of reprieve from 
the pain she has endured for so long. 
Season 2 of “Big Little Lies” 
adds to the emotional depth of 
Season 1 by exploring not only how 
pain and trauma affect women, but 
how pain in many ways is a collec-
tive experience that bounces back 
and forth between its characters. 
It understands that shared trauma 
is something that bonds people 
together, but at the same time can 
also tear them apart.

TV REVIEW

WARNER BROS.

The modern music industry is 
in desperate need of soul. Sure, 
many pop divas are capable of 
gospel-adjacent vocal acrobat-
ics, and most (if not all) chart-
topping chord progressions are 
stolen from the blues, but there’s 
just something about soul music 
that makes it special, makes 
it something to look for. This 
soul is what makes pop-folk-
rock outfit Lake Street Dive so 
intriguing — and so goddamn 
fun to listen to. Made up of five 
conservatory-trained jazz musi-
cians, the group manages to 
merge the funky sounds of clas-
sic soul and R&B with a modern 
folk sensibility, with lead singer 
Rachael Price’s smooth voice 
carrying every influence grace-
fully. 
It’s not an easy thing to mix 
all of these inspirations and pull 
it off without losing the music’s 
innate soul, but Lake Street Dive 
seems to only enhance it, bring-
ing their mix of sounds to a level 
each one couldn’t achieve alone. 
The band is hard to categorize, 
some calling it blue-eyed soul, 
others pop or folk rock, but ful-
filling a niche is not the point of 
their music — it is, quite simply, 
to tell true and lasting stories. 
All this is present in their 
records, but this Tuesday at 
the Royal Oak Music Theatre, 
the audience was in for a pleas-
ant surprise. There’s something 
almost magical about what hap-
pens when all five members of 
Lake Street Dive come together 
and make music, more so than 
could ever be caught on studio 
tape. 
You can tell the bandmates 
have been playing with each 
other for over a decade immedi-
ately, from the way they looked 
at each other and kept up with 
one another throughout the 
concert. Some would say that 
Price, with her stage presence 
and inimitable poise, is the star 
of their live show, but I would 
beg to differ. Bassist Bridget 
Kearney, 
percussionist 
Mike 

Calabrese, 
guitarist/trumpet-
er Mike “McDuck” Olson and 
newer member keyboardist Akie 
Bermiss are all consummate 
performers in their own right, 
bouncing the audience’s atten-
tion back and forth like a musi-
cal beach ball with every song. 
Although 
the 
Royal 
Oak 
Music Theatre was packed for 
the sold-out show, every song 
felt intimate, with the members 
of both opening act The Wood 
Brothers and Lake Street Dive 
themselves inviting the audi-
ence in for a truly shared expe-
rience. There was very little 
banter back and forth between 
songs, but it was unnecessary; 
the lyrics of each tune were 
like a conversation in every way 
except their musicality, as sto-
ries of love, loss and spiteful tri-
umph were told through Price’s 
lilting alto voice. 
By the time they reached 
halfway through the show, the 
audience had lost their inhi-
bitions 
completely, 
dancing 
and bobbing to the undeniably 
catchy beat of bass and drums. 
If there’s anything Lake Street 
Dive knows how to do, it’s put 
on a show. The group ran the 
gamut between their own new 
and old originals and perfectly 
placed covers like Hall & Oates’s 
“Rich Girl” and Sly & the Fam-
ily Stone’s “Everyday People,” 
without losing any of their sin-
gular charm. When they play 
other people’s songs, it doesn’t 
feel like it; they make every mel-
ody their own, infusing a mod-
ern sense of soul into every note. 
When I say that Lake Street 
Dive’s show was one of the 
best I’ve witnessed, don’t take 
it lightly. Their performance 
is beyond anything that can be 
described on paper, as cliche 
and hyperbolic as that seems. 
The band is capable of creat-
ing simultaneous comfort and 
energy in their audiences, lift-
ing them up while leaving them 
in awe of the music they create. 
When they played, they weren’t 
playing alone; instead, the voic-
es of hundreds in the venue rose 
to join them, dancing and shout-
ing out lyrics in a passionate 
embrace of the beat.

shows some soul

Thursday, June 13, 2019
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com ARTS

Songs with a political bent seem 
to skew one of two ways: satirical 
or serious. As for satirical, think 
“Elected” by Alice Cooper (“I’m 
your Yankee doodle dandy in a gold 
Rolls Royce, I want to be elected”) 
or Prince’s “Ronnie, Talk to Russia” 
(“You can go to the zoo, but you can’t 
feed guerrillas”). More earnest songs, 
like Bright Eyes’s “When the Presi-
dent Talks to God” or Killer Mike’s 
“Reagan” take a different tack: care-
ful articulation of injustice, an unre-
lenting urge to expose wrongdoing 
and adversity.
These two approaches have often 
intersected in Tim Heidecker’s career 
as a singer-songwriter. Heidecker, 
who is best known as one half of the 
comedy duo Tim and Eric, tends to 
combine intensity with humor in his 
political music. On his recent single 
“To The Men,” however, he veers 
straight into quiet solemnity. 
Heidecker released “To The Men” 
on May 16, in the midst of a month 
of headlines about new state laws 
restricting access to abortion. The 
song is addressed to the lawmakers 
who passed these bills, and all pro-
ceeds from purchases of the single 
go to the Yellowhammer Fund, a 
nonprofit that supplies funding for 
women in Alabama seeking abor-
tions. 
The song is a tonal departure from 

Heidecker’s previous style. His 2017 
album Too Dumb for Suicide: Tim 
Heidecker’s Trump Songs is a com-
pilation of the tracks he released dur-
ing the first year of Donald Trump’s 
presidency, and they’re all scathing. 
On “Trump Tower,” he sings “Thank 
God for the First Amendment, letting 
me vent,” a line which encapsulates 
his attitude toward the entire album. 
Too Dumb for Suicide is antagonistic, 
shot through with moments of humor 
that feel both vengeful and liberat-
ing. The album makes me tired; it’s 
exhausting to be mad and also find 
humor in that anger. Listening to Too 
Dumb for Suicide, it’s easy to won-
der what might happen if Heidecker 
flipped his focus from Republicans 
onto those whose lives are lived in 
the shadows of their policies.
On “To The Men,” this is exactly 
what he does. “She was poor she was 
just 13 / She was 12 a month ago,” 
Heidecker sings. “She was living in 
Alabama / She was living in Ohio / 
She was living in Georgia / She didn’t 
have anywhere to go.” The song 
isn’t funny at all; it’s sad and angry, 
undiluted by humor. Too Dumb for 
Suicide is a middle finger to the presi-
dent and his allies, a big “fuck you” 
that’s engineered to anger Republi-
cans, not convince them of anything. 
“To The Men” is a plea to those same 
politicians and their supporters. It’s 
as direct and melancholic as an old 
country song, with no time or energy 
for irony. 
Heidecker wrote on Twitter that 

he listened to John Prine while writ-
ing “To The Men,” and this makes 
total sense. Prine’s musical interests 
are in some ways quite similar to 
Heidecker’s. Both artists are fixated 
on absurdity and grief, as well as 
the circumstances in which the two 
are inseparable. They write about 
politics in a similarly snide way: “But 
your flag decal won’t get you into 
Heaven anymore / They’re already 
overcrowded from your dirty little 
war,” sings Prine on “Your Flag Decal 
Won’t Get You into Heaven Any-
more” from his 1971 self-titled album.
Like Heidecker, Prine usually 
balances out cerebral contempla-
tion with wit. On “Bruised Orange 
(Chain of Sorrow),” Prine describes 
the tragedy of a young boy’s senseless 
death with the almost-funny forced 
rhyme of “nuder” and “commuter”: “I 
heard sirens on the train track howl 
naked gettin’ nuder / An altar boy’s 
been hit by a local commuter.” Prine 
also knows when this is the wrong 
approach, when the profundity of 
the subject cannot tolerate cunning 
or guile. “Sam Stone,” for example, 
tells the story of a veteran’s addiction, 
and it’s an absolutely gutting song: 
“There’s a hole in daddy’s arm where 
all the money goes / Jesus Christ died 
for nothin’ I suppose.” Prine employs 
a similarly somber tone on “Unwed 
Fathers,” in which he describes the 
loneliness and isolation of a teenager 
as she becomes a mother. 
Prine’s “Unwed Fathers” covers 
similar territory as “To The Men,” 

but in this song, the protagonist has 
the baby: “From a teenage lover, to 
an unwed mother / Kept undercover, 
like some bad dream,” Prine sings. 
“While unwed fathers, they can’t 
be bothered / They run like water, 
through a mountain stream.” Prine, 
like Heidecker, is using the song to 
raise money for abortion access; on 
May 28, he released a new version to 
raise money for Alabama’s chapter of 
the ACLU. 
Both “Unwed Fathers” and “To 
The Men” name the men who are 
intimately involved in motherhood, 
whether it’s the teenage fathers who 
disappear 
or 
the 
politicians who limit 
women’s 
choices. 
Too 
often, 
abor-
tion is framed as a 
women’s issue, and 
Prine and Heidecker 
use their music to 
discuss 
the 
flaws 
in this logic. They 
explain how men 
can walk away from 
an accidental preg-
nancy and women 
cannot, and how this 
fundamental differ-
ence is perhaps part 
of why some men 
find it so difficult 
to let women make 
their own decisions 
about parenthood — 
it’s a right men have 
enjoyed all along, a 
right they have never had to consider 
or maintain. 
“Unwed Fathers” and “To The 
Men” are powerful in the same 
ways. They were both written by 
men known for their ability to find 
humor in miserable situations, men 
who understand when to put away 
clever wordplay because the gravity 
of the topic demands it. For Prine and 
Heidecker, the particular despera-
tion of the situation is slightly out of 
reach — it’s something neither of 
them have or could ever experience 
firsthand. The songs are perhaps 
more heartbreaking for this fact; 
as straight white men, Prine and 
Heidecker are of the same demo-
graphic as the men who passed the 
“heartbeat” bills, but unlike those 
politicians, they have deep reservoirs 
of empathy and imagination. “Have 
you seen a young girl dying / Have 
you seen ‘em take their final breath,” 
sings Heidecker in the closing lines of 
“To The Men.” 
The story told by Heidecker in “To 
The Men” is grim, whatever your 
opinions on abortion. It’s unclear 
what happens to the protagonist, but 
there’s no good resolution: Either she 
bleeds to death at an illegal abortion 

clinic, or she has a baby while she’s 
still in middle school. In our imper-
fect world, accidental pregnancy 
happens, as it always has — to middle 
schoolers, to survivors of rape, to 
mothers, to the reckless and to the 
responsible. When it happens, some 
women will want and need abortions 
— that, too, will always be the case.
What’s missing from the abortion 
debate is the fact that abortions hap-
pen whether or not they’re legal. Pro-
choicers often argue that those who 
don’t like abortions should simply not 
have them. While I don’t think all (or 
even many) anti-choice politicians 
are actually motivat-
ed by moral impera-
tive, those who are 
vehemently sure life 
begins at concep-
tion will probably 
not be convinced by 
this suggestion. For 
them, ignoring abor-
tion is akin to ignor-
ing genocide.
When 
I 
think 
about people whose 
politics I disagree 
with, I wonder if 
there’s 
anything 
that might convince 
them to re-examine 
their beliefs. Maybe 
this interview with 
a woman who had 
a 
third-trimester 
abortion (her baby 
had genetic issues 
and would have suffocated during 
childbirth), or maybe the story of 
Savita Halappanavar, who died in 
Ireland in 2012 because she was mis-
carrying and doctors refused to give 
her an abortion. 
These stories are powerful, but I 
wonder if they’d feel too distant or 
too rare to convince abortion oppo-
nents. Halappanavar lived in Ireland, 
not the United States, and the story 
of the late-term abortion is far from 
typical. It might be a stretch to say 
“To The Men” could change some-
one’s mind on abortion, but what if 
it has that power? Everyone’s stance 
on abortion is guided by feelings as 
much as, if not more than, facts — 
there are smart people on both sides 
of the issue, people who can look at 
the same biological concepts and 
come to opposite conclusions. Maybe 
music is the way to foreground emo-
tions, to recognize their centrality in 
the debate over abortion. Songs like 
“To The Men” and “Unwed Fathers” 
won’t brainwash anyone, but they 
might have the power to cultivate 
new feelings. 

Heidecker’s ‘To The Men’ 
is addressed to everyone

Not many former childhood 
stars are willing to embrace 
their pasts. Just look at Miley 
Cyrus and Demi Lovato, who 
are still trying to live down 
their Disney Channel perso-
nas and establish themselves 
as more than puppets con-
trolled by a major TV network. 
Moreover, not many bands find 
their way back together after a 
breakup, especially when the 
breakup provides 
an 
opportunity 
for 
individual 
experimentation 
and success. 
Despite all the 
factors 
working 
against them, the 
Jonas 
Brothers 
defied the odds 
with their new 
album, Happiness 
Begins. 
Their 
first in ten years, 
Happiness Begins 
pleasantly docu-
ments the power 
of familial ties 
and how the concept of fam-
ily has changed for the three 
brothers. 
The album starts out with 
“Sucker,” which already soared 
on the charts back in April. 
With a blend of electronic dance 
elements 
from 
Joe’s 
career 
with the pop band DNCE and 
the sexy, raspy vocals of Nick’s 
solo work, “Sucker” provides a 
modern twist on the traditional 
Jonas sound. 
“Sucker,” 
along 
with 
the 
album’s other single, “Cool,” 
have already proven successful 
on the radio, and songs such as 
“Only Human” and “I Believe” 
have followed suit as they con-
tinue to pick up streams on Spo-
tify. While each song maintains 
its own unique subject matter 
and sound, a common theme is a 
mellow, laid-back vibe, whether 
it be found lyrically or musi-
cally. “Only Human” takes on 
a modern reggae style with its 
unhurried tempo and promi-

nent synthesizers, while “Cool” 
lyrically paints a picture of a 
couple friends just hanging out 
and feeling confident in them-
selves. 
Happiness Begins includes a 
lot of radio-friendly nuggets, 
but buried in the mix is also a 
collection of deeper, emotion-
driven tracks. Songs like “Love 
Her” and “Trust” dive into the 
ways love takes over a person’s 
everything and often leaves 
them feeling out of control. 
“Hesitate” is a ballad about lay-
ing down everything to be there 
for the person you love.
But the album 
isn’t 
all 
sappy 
love songs and 
radio hits. “Roll-
ercoaster” 
is 
an upbeat tune 
about life, cel-
ebrating 
the 
adventure of love 
for all its twists 
and turns. Hid-
den within the 
song’s lyrics are 
the words “hap-
piness 
begins,” 
which brings the 
themes of renew-
al and letting go 
back in, full circle. 
The most notable aspect of 
the album is the way it holds 
onto the old while still intro-
ducing something new. Instead 
of trying to brush their old 
image away and start fresh, the 
Jonas Brothers gladly revisit 
their past work, whether it be 
recreating old YouTube videos 
or performing their old music 
at live shows. Happiness Begins 
exemplifies this contrast of old 
versus new in how the band was 
able to hold onto their roots 
while presenting their audi-
ences with more relevant and 
mature subject matter. While 
the new album doesn’t sound 
much like the garage boy band 
the Jonas Brothers used to be, 
they were able to hold onto 
some crucial elements, like 
Nick’s vocal riffs and the band’s 
sing-songy harmonies.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com MICHIGAN IN COLOR

In the opening scenes of “Always 
Be My Maybe,” Sasha Tran (Ali 
Wong) makes herself a lonely din-
ner. But soon, she leaves for her 
best friend Marcus’s (Randall Park) 
house, where his mom makes kimchi 
jjigae, the classic, spicy stew brim-
ming with kimchi, tofu and more. 
My mouth watered at the sight; it 
reminded me of all the times my own 
mom made kimchi jjigae, which was 
(and still is) the only way she could 
get me to eat kimchi.
Food is central to the new Netflix 
rom-com “Always Be My Maybe.” 
Sasha herself is a chef, but even 
then, food is a way for characters to 
reconnect (as Sasha and Marcus do 
at a Chinese restaurant) or become 
hyper-aware of their differences (as 
Sasha and Marcus do at an upscale 
restaurant that serves questionably 
pretentious food). Food is more than 
just what’s set at the table: Food tells 
a story, shares a history, is a culture.
(Side anecdote about how food is 
more than just food: before a meal, 
Koreans say something that roughly 
translates to a conveyance of grati-
tude for their meal. When I say this 
out loud, I sometimes remember 
that Koreans didn’t always have 
easy access to food, especially after 
the Korean War. As my parents told 
me, there was a shortage of rice 
after the war, and flour was cheap 
because Americans sent flour as aid 
⁠— guess it was the least they could 
do after splitting the Korean penin-
sula in two. Koreans started mak-
ing a ton of noodle dishes to keep 
their stomachs full like my favorite, 
kalguksu⁠ — if you haven’t seen Net-
flix’s “Street Food” yet, which fea-
tures this dish in its “Seoul” episode, 
then go watch it.)
As I watched “Always Be My 
Maybe,” I was not only taking in the 
beauty of Ali Wong and Randall Park 
excelling at their comedy and being 
sexy and funny and all the things 
that might not check the boxes of 
your stereotypical Asian-American 
character; I was taking in the food 
and the conversations around it. 
There’s a scene toward the second 
half of the movie where Marcus 
confronts Sasha about her high-
end restaurants and how she caters 
to rich white people, abandoning 
the authenticity of Vietnamese and 
other Asian cuisines.

This is another example of how 
food is more than just food and how 
it can often get tangled in identity 
politics. It made me think of all the 
times in Washington, D.C. last sum-
mer that I walked past fast food 
fusion Asian places. Growing up, my 
mom and I drove forty-five minutes 
on the New Jersey turnpike (a night-
mare) to go to the nearest H Mart 
and to a street in Palisades Park that 
was dotted with Korean-owned, 
traditional Korean restaurants on 
every block. So when I saw fast 
food fusion Korean places in D.C. 
catering toward white middle-class 
Americans, I was surprised and 
maybe, admittedly, a little annoyed.
Maybe I was annoyed because 
these places catered to an audience 
who, in my experience moving to 
a predominantly white neighbor-
hood, only ever turned their noses 
to exotic foods like mine (I’m that 
classic Asian-American kid who 
never brought Korean food to school 
again after another student made 
a comment about it). Maybe I was 
annoyed because these places didn’t 
show the less glamorous dishes that 
I ate nearly every single day (Korean 
food isn’t just nicely plated, color-
ful bibimbap and sizzling KBBQ) 
(not that many Americans know 
the kinds of various meats that go 
into KBBQ) (it’s not just one type 
of meat, y’all) (by the way, did you 
know that we use the bones of meat 
for our broths?) (talk about exotic 
and not wasteful!).
Maybe I was annoyed because I 
(wrongly) assumed that all of these 
businesses were owned by white 
people trying to make money off 
of more “approachable” or “clean” 
Asian food — the most recent exam-
ple of which was Lucky Lee’s in 
New York, whose owner marketed 
“clean” Chinese food that didn’t 
make you feel “bloated or icky” 
(guess she didn’t know, or chose to 
ignore, the history of Chinese res-
taurants being called “nuisances” 
and full of “stench” as part of anti-
Chinese sentiment in the late 1800s 
— hello, Chinese Exclusion Act! — 
and early 1900s). Another golden 
example: remember when The New 
York Times “discovered” boba?
But I soon found out that some of 
these chains were Asian-American 
owned, and I felt slightly embar-
rassed by my original thoughts but 
also felt better about these places 
— though this opened up a new set 
of questions. Were these owners 

abandoning authenticity and cav-
ing to the average white American’s 
palette (as Marcus accuses Sasha of 
doing)? Or was it more complicated 
than that?
As I contemplated this question, 
I thought of my mom’s budae jjigae, 
which includes American cheese. 
You can’t get more American than 
American cheese, and it wasn’t like 
it suddenly turned my mom’s dish 
into an inauthentically Korean one 
(who draws the line, anyways?). I 
certainly felt Korean while eating 
her budae jjigae. Besides, cultures — 
and foods — change all the time.
It doesn’t (and shouldn’t) have to 
be either you’re authentic, or you’re 
not. As this Refinery29 article 
shows, Asian-American fusion food 
is more nuanced than meets the eye. 
Asian-American chefs who grew 
up in America ate traditional foods 
from both their heritage and classic 
American dishes; Priya Krishna, a 
Bon Appetit contributor, would eat 
her mother’s roti pizza, saag paneer 
with feta cheese and dahi toast with 
sourdough bread. Her family had 
to make do with the grocery stores 
available to them (we can’t all have 
an Asian food market near us!) to 
bring to the table their favorite Indi-
an foods.
“Always Be My Maybe” is part of 
this conversation around food, and 
authenticity and identity. While 
Marcus is initially angry at Sasha 
for her restaurant’s inauthentic 
menu, he’s awed by the place when 
he visits for the first time. And 
though Sasha’s first two restaurants 
serve less traditional Asian food, the 
third restaurant she opens at the end 
of the movie is an homage to Mar-
cus and his late mother, the center 
of which is his mother’s exact kim-
chi jjigae recipe. Sasha can move 
between all three restaurants, serv-
ing both “authentic” and “inauthen-
tic” food. She’s not stuck in some 
binary — she’s all her own.angry 
at Sasha for her restaurant’s inau-
thentic menu, he’s awed by the place 
when he visits for the first time. And 
though Sasha’s first two restaurants

My tears flow like yours

As does my blood when you cut me

Tearing the color off my skin

Slicing the culture off my clothes

Scraping the accent off my tongue

I tell you the Nile flows through my veins

My hands as textured as papyrus

My skin as brown as the desert sand

And my hair as black as the kohl

That my ancestors invented

And you took as your own

In ways I was never taken as your own

I scream at you

Just because you insist

The opposite of light is dark

Doesn’t mean

The opposite of dark is right

With the grace of my ancestors

The pharaohs of vast empires

Prospering ages before yours

I grow where I was planted

And I’ll let you cower under my branches

While my roots dig deep

Into the banks of the Nile

Erin Finn finishes 12th place in her final race as a Wolverine

Thursday 
night 
marked 
the 
culmination of collegiate distance 
running as well as the final 10,000 
meters of sixth-year senior Erin 
Finn’s 
illustrious 
career 
as 
a 
Wolverine.
Twenty-four of the nation’s best 
assembled at Mike A. Myers Stadium 
in Austin, Texas to represent their 
schools in the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships.
The women’s 10,000-meter final 
began with a congested cluster 
of runners stretching four lanes 
wide. Finn quickly earned an inside 
position within the top five and held 
a steady pace for the first 10-15 laps.
An injury-riddled season afforded 
Finn less than two months and just 
three events of competitive running 
to prepare, forcing her to adopt a 
new, unfamiliar approach.
“The start was great,” Finn said. 
“My plan was to not do any of the 
work (of leading). Ideally, I like to 
control the race, but my body was not 
strong enough, not fit enough at this 
point.”
During the first half of the race, 
Finn’s strategy was predicated on 
staying within striking distance of 
Notre Dame’s Anna Rohrer, who 
jumped out to an early lead. After 

falling out of the top five, Finn pushed 
her way back with 8 laps remaining. 
But the heat, humidity, and 
exhaustion began to take its toll on 
the runners with just four laps to go, 
providing the ultimate separation 
that would define the race.
“My 
body 
really 
started 
to 
struggle,” Finn said. “I got passed 
and I got gapped.”
With runners falling in and out 
of contention, the only competitor 
seemingly unaffected was New 
Mexico’s Weini Kelati, who used 
the last mile to build a nearly 
insurmountable lead.
However, the final lap catalyzed 
an 
inspiring 
comeback 
from 
Carmela Cardama Baez of Oregon. 
Trailing by nearly five seconds, 
Cardama Baez climbed all the way 
back, approaching within a meter 
of Kelati. Alerted by the roar of the 
crowd, Kelati propelled one final 
push, giving her all the separation 
she needed. With only 50 meters to 
go following an exhaustive effort, 
Cardama Baez had neither the time 
nor the energy to complete the 
comeback.
Kelati finished with a time of 
33:10.84, a record at Mike A. Myers 
Stadium.
Finn 
delivered 
a 
similarly 
admirable finale. As a sixth-year 
senior clawing her way back from hip 

surgery, she was nearly 20 seconds 
ahead of the next finisher.
She ended up in 12th place with a 
time of 33:40.88, capturing a second-
team All-America honor.
“It’s definitely not the way I 
dreamed of going out, especially after 
some of my earlier successes,” the 
ten-time USTFCCCA All-American 
said. “But given this journey I’ve 

had the last year and a half, a couple 
weeks before Big Ten’s I didn’t know 
if I’d be running at all this season. I 
was really thankful that I could have 
one last go around.”
The finish line represented the 
conclusion of this year’s track and 
field season as well as the career of 
one of the most decorated athletes in 
school history.

“I had that flashback,” Finn said. 
“It wasn’t of anything I had done. 
Just thinking about my teammates, 
my coach, my assistant coaches, 
my athletic trainer, just all the 
people who have touched my life, 
recognizing these people will forever 
be in my life. Although my days as 
an athlete are over, my days as a 
Wolverine are not.”

Jabri Abdur-Rahim becomes one of Juwan Howard’s first offers

Jabri Abdur-Rahim talked to 
Juwan Howard for the first time 
on Thursday. And, in a stark 
departure from his predecessor, 
the conversation came with a 
scholarship offer.
John Beilein held a firm policy 
when it came to these things. 
Until a recruit stepped foot on 
campus, took a full academic 
tour, and Beilein had seen him 
play in-person, he didn’t extend 
an offer. In the last two days, 
Howard has extended his first 
two offers as Michigan’s coach, 
first to five-star guard Joshua 
Christopher and then to Abdur-
Rahim — and neither have held 
firm to that policy.
“I understand coach Beilein’s 
way of doing things,” Abdur-
Rahim told The Daily. “That’s 

the approach that a lot of schools 
take. Which is something I 
understand. I also understand 
the other way, too. So it’s just two 
different perspectives. I respect 
both of them.”
Since 
Beilein 
left, 
Saddi 
Washington 
has 
been in touch with 
Abbdur-Rahim, 
maintaining 
a 
relationship 
and 
bridging 
the gap between 
coaches. Though 
not yet officially 
announced, 
Washington 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
retained on Howard’s staff, with 
Phil Martelli and Howard Eisley 
rounding out the coaching staff.
“They’re 
trying 
to 
grow 
something special at Michigan,” 

Abdur-Rahim said. “(Howard) 
hopes that I could be a part of 
that.”
Abdur-Rahim, a four-star wing 
ranked 41st in the country per 
247Sports’ composite, previously 
had 
an 
official 
visit to Ann Arbor 
scheduled 
for 
May 27, but that 
was swept away 
amidst the chaos 
of 
a 
coaching 
search. As of now, 
he has no plans set 
in stone for a visit, 
but 
that 
could 
change.
“Once 
all 
that 
stuff 
with 
(Beilein) happened, that kind 
of took over the timeframe that 
I had set for my junior year 
officials,” 
Abdur-Rahim 
said. 
“Now, I’m gonna just regroup and 

take my officials as a senior and 
see where that goes.”
When asked whether Howard’s 
status as a member of the Fab 
Five impacted his perception 
of Michigan, Jabri chose to 
focus instead on 
Howard’s 
NBA 
experience.
“It’s 
interesting, 
because 
he’s 
obviously done it 
before,” 
Abdur-
Rahim said. “So 
that 
perspective 
is 
pretty 
cool, 
a 
person 
that’s 
played 
at 
the

I said, I’m just trying to do my 
homework on everybody. Not just 
Michigan.”
Right now, Abdur-Rahim said, 
his recruitment is wide open 

and will likely hinge on what 
he sees in the upcoming season. 
He, as everyone else, has little 
indication of what Howard’s 
basketball philosophy is and 
plans to be watching closely come 
the fall to find out.
“I 
feel 
like 
I’m gonna have 
a better sense of 
my view once I 
see them,” Abdur-
Rahim said. “... 
So I can watch 
gameplay, 
can 
watch 
everyone 
else play. Compare 
and contrast the 
schools 
I 
like 
and the schools 
I don’t like. So my view is the 
same for everybody right now. 
I’ll definitely start gaining some 
stronger opinions on a lot of 
things once the season starts.”

Henry, four other Wolverines selected in 2019 MLB Draft

As the sun set in Corvallis 
on Monday night, the Michigan 
baseball team was celebrating — 
they had just beat Creighton in 
the NCAA Regional final game, 
17-6, on the back of its potent 
offense.
Then, they were given another 
reason 
to 
celebrate: 
within 
minutes of each other, the two 
junior 
Michigan 
aces 
were 
drafted. 
Left-hander 
Tommy 
Henry 
was 
drafted 
by 
the 
Arizona Diamondbacks with the 
74th pick and right-hander Karl 
Kauffmann went to the Colorado 
Rockies at No. 77.
They were the first of five 
Wolverine upperclassman to be 
drafted. Next was Big Ten Player 
of the Year junior outfielder 
Jordan Brewer, who was No. 106 
overall to the Houston Astros. 
Then junior right-hander Jack 
Weisenburger went to Oakland at 
No. 614 and finally, senior infielder 
Jimmy Kerr came in at No. 982, 
drafted by the Detroit Tigers.

For Kauffmann and Henry, 
being drafted was expected; both 
had been impressive starters the 
last two years and shutting down 
opposing offenses.
Henry 
watched 
his 
draft 
stock skyrocket throughout the 
first two months of the season. 
He allowed just three runs in 
his first five starts, including a 
one-hit shutout at The Citadel, 
where he threw just 88 pitches, 
facing 27 batters and striking 
out 13. Towards the end of the 
season, though, he began to 
falter. His earned-run average 
nearly doubled after a string of 
bad starts, where it eventually 
finished 
at 
3.61, 
eventually 
pushing him from Friday starter 
to Saturday starter — replaced by 
the man picked three spots later.
Kauffmann, steady throughout 
the year, ended with the lowest 
ERA on the team at 2.62. He 
wasn’t 
a 
strikeout 
pitcher 
like Henry, though. Instead, 
Kauffmann would let his defense 
do the work by inducing ground 
ball after ground ball.
Weisenburger, 
the 
lone 

member of the Michigan bullpen 
to be drafted, did not put up 
the impressive numbers that 
Kauffmann and Henry did. With 
just 29 innings of use this year 
and 27.2 last year, Weisenburger 
had a .6 walk-to-strikeout ratio 
in his junior campaign and was 
often the third or fourth arm to 
come out of the bullpen.
This 
year’s 
breakout 
performer for the Wolverines is 
quite clearly the junior college 
transfer Brewer. In his first 
year of Division I baseball, the 
outfielder stole the show. He 
made astonishing diving catches 
and key pick-off throws from 
the warning track to keep games 
close. In the batters box, he came 
alive with a team-high slugging 
percentage and batting average 
of .612 and .349, respectively, 
along with 23 steals.
Another standout from this 
year, Kerr spent almost all 
of his time at first base and 
started every single game this 
year. The regionals were a 
snapshot of Kerr’s season for the 
Wolverines: 4 home runs in four 

games. In other words, Kerr was 
clutch.
So as the rounds went by and 
Michigan was preparing for 
its clash against No. 1 UCLA, 

players boarded the bus after 
practice and went wild when 
they heard the news that their 
captain was drafted by the team 
45 miles away.

Big game success: A look at how Michigan flipped the script

The 
past 
two 
weeks, 
the 
Michigan 
baseball 
team 
has 
captured the attention of every 
college baseball fan in the country 
as it’s made a run to the College 
World Series.
At first, though, it wasn’t even 
clear the Wolverines would make 
the tournament; they had barely 
avoided an early exit from the Big 
Ten Tournament with a walk-off 
double from Jordan Nwogu, and 
before that, they had relinquished 
the Big Ten regular season title 
in two straight series losses to 
Indiana and Nebraska.
They weren’t playing well, 
they were tight and showing a 
weakness for big time games.
“You don’t play baseball well 
when 
you’re 
stressed,” 
said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich after 
the series at Nebraska. “So we’re 
going into this weekend loose, 
confident and relaxed.”
It 
was 
a 
common 
thread 
throughout their season that 
big games were their weakness, 

especially 
in 
April 
after 
disappointing series losses at 
Ohio State, Texas Tech (who they 
will play this Saturday) and in 
California.
Until May 20, in a game against 
No. 20 Illinois, it wasn’t clear 
whether Michigan would show 
up 
in 
the 
big 
moments.
Then there was 
Nwogu’s big hit, 
and the next day, 
there was life in a 
team that looked 
despondent in the 
days before.
The Wolverines 
won 
their 
next 
game 
against 
Maryland, almost 
guaranteeing their spot in the 
NCAA tournament.
Throughout the year, Michigan 
beat itself more than anyone 
else. 
Errors, 
walks 
and 
bad 
baserunning would all converge 
on 
the 
same 
day 
and 
give 
opponents easy victories. Four 
errors, two hit-by-pitches and 
three walks gifted a game to the 

Hoosiers. Four errors and nine 
walks resulted in an 11-2 loss to 
the Red Raiders.
Even last Saturday against No. 1 
UCLA in the Super Regionals, the 
Wolverines had five crucial errors 
and 10 walks while three of the 
five Bruin runs were unearned.
But 
for 
the 
most part in the 
last two weeks, 
Michigan 
has 
played lights out, 
no longer weighed 
down 
by 
self-
inflicted pressure. 
It 
has 
gotten 
the 
clutch 
hits 
when it needed to 
and hasn’t been 
crushed by the big 
time lights.
“What I’d like us to do better is 
continue to trend upwards when 
we have setbacks like this, to use 
it as growth and fuel to better 
our performance in the future,” 
Bakich said after the series at 
Ohio State. “If we’re going to be 
the team that I think we’re going 
to be, then we’re going to have to 

play well when it means the most 
and a rivalry series is one of those 
weekends when it means the 
most.”
Apparently 
the 
Wolverines 

needed to see a clutch hit to believe 
it and when Nwogu launched a 
double against the Illini, they 
bought in and have finally grown 
to their true potential.

Tommy Henry shines when it matters most for the Wolverines

The bottom of the seventh inning 
got off to a rocky start for Michigan.
With the count at 1-2 and his 
team trailing, 3-2, UCLA freshman 
catcher Noah Cardenas smacked a 
leadoff double into the gap against 
the Wolverines’ junior left-hander 
Tommy Henry. The energy in the 
stadium intensified, while Henry 
calmed.
Battle tested, Henry has pitched 
in high pressure environments 
before, and channeled the resulting 
experience to his advantage.
The following batter for the 
Bruins, 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Jack Stronach, sacrifice bunted, 
establishing a one-out and runner 
on third situation. With the infield 
in, Henry then induced a quick 
groundout to third to secure out 
number two.
Cardenas remained stranded at 
third, but with two outs, UCLA’s 
top hitter, sophomore center fielder 

Garrett Mitchell slowly made his 
way into the box. After working 
himself into an advantageous 3-1 
count, Mitchell waved through a 
slider to bring the count full.
On his 104th pitch of the night, 
Henry delivered another slider, this 
time high and tight. Mitchell made 
contact, softly lining the ball onto 
the infield grass between the first 
and second baseman.
Senior first baseman Jimmy 
Kerr made the read and fielded the 
ball on the hop. Henry, recognizing 
the vacated base, hustled over to 
cover the bag. In his footrace with 
Mitchell, one of the fastest players in 
the country, Henry won by an inch 
–– securing his final out of the night 
and preserving the Michigan lead.
His final line: a remarkable seven 
innings pitched, seven hits, two 
earned runs, six strikeouts, and no 
walks.
All that while battling the flu.
“Looking at this team, looking at 
this field, the super regional stage, 
it’s something that I know all of 

us have envisioned playing in the 
backyard growing up, every time 
you’re swinging a bat,” Henry said. 
“You know, you envision these 
moments and you dream about 
being on this stage. So, I know that 
the 35 of them would not skip a beat 
and would never miss this moment, 
so I wasn’t going to either.”
For Henry, yesterday’s outing 
came on the heels of an up-and-
down season.
On April 10th, the lefty was 
named 
to 
the 
Golden 
Spikes 
Midseason Watchlist, the award 
given to the best player in college 
baseball.
However, following an eight-
inning 
performance 
against 
Michigan State on March 29th, 
Henry’s 
earned-run 
average 
gradually rose from 0.76 to 3.69. In 
his last two regular season outings 
of the year, he ceded 12 runs across 
10 innings of work.
Once the postseason arrived 
though, Henry returned to form. 
In the Big Ten Tournament, Henry 

threw seven innings across one 
start and one relief appearance. 
He allowed two runs total while 
striking out nine hitters and walking 
only one.
Last weekend, Henry excelled 
again as he twirled seven and a third 
innings of three run baseball against 
Creighton, one of the nation’s most 
imposing offenses.
But last night was Henry’s 
biggest test of the year against top-
seeded UCLA. It was perhaps his 
most important outing since he 
pitched in game one of the Cape 
Cod League semifinals last summer. 
In that game, Henry started, but 
lasted a mere 1.1 innings. Last night, 
he reflected upon how that game 
enabled him to grow as a pitcher.
“There were definitely a lot of 
learning experiences being out at a 
place like The Cape. You’re facing 
the best of the best and it really gives 
you a chance to learn.” Henry said. 
“And that’s a credit to Coach Bakich 
for giving us the tools to have an 
open mind and use those learning 

experiences to make yourself better. 
The credit goes to him for working 
hard on that, drawing us all in 
together, speaking to us about it and 
giving us those tools so that when 
you do face adversity, you can learn 
from it and improve.”
In the face of more adversity last 
night and his team’s season on the 
line, the tools were on full display 
as Henry locked down a potent 
Bruin offense. He made continuous 
adjustments on the mound and as a 
result did not allow a run in his final 
four innings of work.
In addition to his impressive 
seventh inning, the fifth inning 
provided a major highlight as well. 
With the count full and runners on 
second and third, Henry spun in a 
curveball to ring up UCLA junior 
second baseman Chase Strumpf. 
After unleashing a roar, Henry 
quickly stared down Strumpf as he 
returned to the dugout.
Now, Henry has the Wolverines 
staring down their first Omaha trip 
since 1984.

Michigan eliminates UCLA 4-2 to advance to College World Series

The Michigan baseball team 
was in a familiar position against a 
familiar foe.
Trailing 2-1 to No. 1 UCLA in the 
fifth inning, they sorely needed some 
clutch hitting.
Junior 
outfielder 
Christian 
Bullock opened the fifth inning 
with a walk and then stole second 
base. Blomgren hit a single, allowing 
Bullock to advance to third. The 
Wolverines 
then 
turned 
near-
calamity 
into 
opportunity. 
As 
Blomgren was inches away from 
being picked off at first, he avoided 
the tag and beat the failed rundown 
attempt to advance to second.
And with runners in scoring 
position, Ako Thomas delivered.
The senior infielder drilled a two-
RBI ground-ball single to retake the 
lead for Michigan, 3-2.
The 
Wolverines 
added 
one 
more run and were able to hold off 
the Bruins for the third time this 
season, winning 4-2 to advance to 
the College World Series for the first 
time since 1984.
Michigan opened the scoring in 
the top of the second inning. Senior 
infielder Blake Nelson was walked 
and junior outfielder Christian 

Bullock smashed a double down 
the first base line to advance Nelson 
to third. Sophomore infielder Jack 
Blomgren stepped up and delivered 
a ground ball allowing Nelson to 
score.
The Bruins weren’t daunted. In 
the bottom of the second, outfielder 
Jake Pries launched a solo home 
run to left-center on the third pitch 
of the inning to tie the game at 1-1. 
UCLA broke the deadlock in the 
third inning. The score was set up 
by an untimely slip and fall by junior 
outfielder Jordan Brewer in right 
field allowing the fly ball to get past 
him and the batter to reach third. A 
ground ball to the shortstop allowed 
the runner on third to cross home 
plate.
The Wolverines’ defensive issues 
continued from Saturday and nearly 
caused a disaster in the fourth 
inning. With two outs and a Bruins 
runner on first, a ground ball came 
to Nelson who bobbled the ball, then 
rushed the throw to first airmailing 
senior first baseman Jimmy Kerr. 
Kerr hustled to get the ball and 
fired a throw to home plate where 
sophomore catcher Joe Donovan 
applied the tag to the diving UCLA 
runner to get the out.
The Michigan offense sputtered 
after the early innings, in a game that 

was eerily reminiscent of Saturday’s 
contest. This time, however, they 
received an insurance run in the top 
of the ninth to extend the lead to 4-2.
Bullock crushed a ball into 
left-center over the heads of the 
outfielders and used his speed to 
stretch it into a triple. A sac-fly from 
Donovan sent Bullock home. Bullock 
went two for three, stole a base and 
scored twice; an incredible bounce-
back game after a forgettable 
Saturday where a costly error 
allowed UCLA to score a crucial run.
Tommy Henry did his part for the 
Wolverines. The junior left-hander 
was fighting an illness and pitched 
seven innings, giving up only two 
runs while striking out six. Innings 
four through seven, Henry was rock-
solid allowing no runs and coming 
up with clutch outs when the Bruins 
were threatening.
Redshirt 
junior 
left-hander 
Benjamin Keizer replaced Henry. 
Keizer went 1-2-3 in the eighth but 
ran into some adversity in the bottom 
of the ninth. He allowed a single and 
then hit the very next batter before a 
pop-fly and a ground ball ended the 
Bruins’ comeback bid.
It was a gutsy performance from 
Keizer and the entire team, sending 
the Wolverines to their first College 
World Series in 35 years.
