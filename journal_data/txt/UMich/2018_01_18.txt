Ann Arbor startup May 

Mobility successfully tested 
their fleet of driverless cars 
on the streets of Detroit in 
October, and now plan to 
expand the testing to Florida 
and Texas.

Edwin 
Olson, 
the 
CEO 

of 
May 
Mobility, 
started 

out working with Toyota’s 
autonomous vehicles program, 
and then decided he could 
make more of a difference by 
creating his own company. In 
January 2017, Olson created 
May Mobility.

“I think that too much time 

is going by, and there are a lot 

of things that we can actually 
do, but a lot of companies are 
taking paths that will take 
many more years to turn into 
real world products,” Olson 
said. “So part of our approach 
is really about having real 
world 
impact 
as 
soon 
as 

possible.”

Olson discussed all of the 

advantages 
of 
driverless 

cars, 
from 
safety 
to 
the 

environmental 
benefits 
of 

switching 
from 
gas 
cars 

to a greener solution. As 
an 
example, 
he 
discussed 

the 
potential 
commercial 

benefits of being able to 
have 
autonomous 
vehicles 

transport 
people 
from 

hotels 
to 
restaurants. 
He 

Central 
Student 

Government 
hosted 
the 

kickoff 
and 
information 

session for Innovate, a public 
service 
pitch 
competition, 

in 
the 
Michigan 
League 

Wednesday 
evening 
with 

approximately 100 students 
in attendance. Students were 
able to hear information on 
how to become involved in the 
program, and were addressed 
by several guest speakers.

Innovate is a program in 

which students can sign up 
to pitch a public service or 
entrepreneurship 
project 

with the chance of winning 
$10,000 
to 
help 
fund 

continuation of their created 
project. The deadline to sign 
up is Jan. 26, and students can 
either sign up with a group or 
as an individual to be paired 
with 
other 
individuals 
of 

similar interests. Each group 
will then receive mentors, 
networks, 
feedback 
and 

advice on public speaking and 
other aspects important to 
the field of entrepreneurship.

Previous 
winners 
range 

from 
online 
communities 

of information available to 
teachers and students around 
to the world to agriculture-
based programs for older 
adults. 

The first round of judging 

will take place on Feb. 12, and 
the final round of pitches will 

be March 7.

CSG Chief Programming 

Officer Isabelle Blanchard, 
an LSA sophomore, served 
as the Innovate Coordinator, 
and explained students do 
not need a pre-formulated 
plan or solid project in order 
to sign up, but simply need a 
passion and an interest in a 
public service idea. Blanchard 
explained she looks forward 

to students working to build 
upon ideas they already have 
enthusiasm for, and hopes 
that Innovate will engage 
a broader population of the 
student body.

“We already have twenty 

sign-ups and the projects are 
all really diverse,” Blanchard 
said. “I’m also excited just to 
get the student body really 
involved 
… 
We’re 
hoping 

to follow up with teams 
throughout the competition 
and really publicize their 
projects to the student body, 
and in the end the student 
body will also be voting.”

CSG 
President 
Anushka 

Sarkar, an LSA senior, was 
the introductory speaker at 
the kickoff event where she 
highlighted the importance 

Approximately 
40 
students 

gathered in the Alumni Center 
Wednesday night to listen as a 
diverse cast of panelists — many 
of them recent University of 
Michigan graduates — shared 
their 
personal 
experiences 

and 
answered 
questions 

regarding power dynamics and 
intersectionality of identities in 
the workplace.

The event, titled “Navigating 

the Workplace: Underrepresented 
and Invisible Identities,” focused 
on 
helping 
undergraduate 

students navigate the oftentimes 
complicated process of applying 
for jobs and internships — yet 
emphasized how the process 
can be even more difficult for 
students 
who 
hold 
various 

underrepresented 
identities 

based on qualifiers such as race, 
gender and class.

Panelists included Public Policy 

graduate student Ammara Ansari, 
who worked as a campaign field 
organizer for Hillary Clinton’s 
presidential campaign in 2015; 
Danny Park, who works as a 
success coach in the University’s

The Sustainability Cultural 

Indicators Program is launching 
its fifth annual survey this 
week, 
collecting 
data 
from 

University 
of 
Michigan 

students, staff and faculty. The 

longitudinal study is conducted 
by the University’s Graham 
Sustainability Institute and the 
Institute for Social Research, 
and 
focuses 
on 
awareness, 

attitudes and behaviors relating 
to sustainability in participants.

The SCIP project has tracked 

sustainability culture at the 
University since 2012, though it 

took a two-year break to avoid 
overlapping with an ongoing 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
survey.

John Callewaert, Integrated 

Assessment 
Center 
director 

of the Graham Institute and 
one of the survey’s principal 
investigators, explains the SCIP 
project is revolutionary because 

it is the first longitudinal study 
to track sustainability culture, 
and its innovativeness is being 
replicated at other institutes.

“It’s been used as a model 

at many other institutions,” 
Callewaert said. “I think we 
are up to over 130 different 
institutions around the world

also 
discussed 
the 
longer-

term benefits, such as the 
possibility of restructuring city 
development.

“Huge amounts of real estate 

are devoted to parking, and 
that’s basically because nobody 
wants 
to 
walk 
anywhere, 

so you build a lot of parking 
next to every possible place 
people want to go,” Olson said. 
“The problem is that then you 
provision the parking next to 
each building in accordance 
with that building’s sort of 
peak demand, which leads 
to city planners or property 
developers creating far more 
parking than is really necessary. 
If you can efficiently get people 

into a neighborhood and then 
transport them within that 
neighborhood without getting 
them to re-park, you can 
reclaim that land and turn it 
into more retail or more parks, 
and that’s really exciting to 
the city planners and property 
developers that we talk to.”

Aside from being located in 

Ann Arbor and employing many 
University of Michigan alumni, 
May Mobility has major ties 
to the University. Olsen said 
they have licensed technology 
with the University that has 
been imperative for getting the 
fleet of cars to work, as well as 
technology that helps ensure 
vehicle safety.

“Getting 
our 
cars 
on 

public roads within our first 
months of operation couldn’t 
have happened without this 
relationship with U-M,” Olson 

said in University press release.

Steve Vozar, May Mobility’s 

chief technology officer and one 
of the many University alums 
employed by the company, 
received his bachelor’s degree, 
master’s degree and Ph.D in 
Engineering at the University.

Vozar talked about how 

May Mobility differed from 
competitors because they were 
done 
waiting 
for 
someone 

else to produce a functioning 
driverless car company.

“To me it’s really exciting 

to be at the forefront of a 
transportation 
revolution,” 

Vozar said. “I’ve worked on 
other 
autonomous 
vehicle 

projects 
before, 
and 
the 

approach that we have with 
May Mobility is unique and 
very grounded in reality, and 
it’s an approach that will 

market sooner than we 
think other competitors 
will be able to do: the 
structure, 
environment, 

going block by block and 
making sure the system 
can handle everything we 
can throw at it. There’s a 
realism 
associated 
with 

that – we’re not waiting 
for the next breakthrough 
in AI, we want to generate 
business in the very near 
future, and this approach 
is how we’re going to do 
that.”

Vozar also spoke about 

how much he valued the 
company’s 
relationship 

with the University, both 
as an employee and as an 
alum.

“A lot of the connections 

that I made in grad school 
at U of M are now coming 
back to me at May,” Vozar 
said. “I may not have 
thought about this person 
in years, but they’ve got 
some company that they’re 
working with, or they have 
some candidates for me, or 
they have some cool new 

technology that we might want 
to integrate. So there’s sort of a 
diaspora into the leadership of 
big and small companies from 
Michigan 
Engineering, 
and 

it’s great to be able to use that 
network.”

Specifically, Vozar believes 

the benefits of having access 

to 
Mcity, 
the 
University’s 

testing facility for automated 
vehicles in simulated urban 
and 
suburban 
driving 

environments.

“Resources like Mcity are 

really crucial for us to do testing 
in a controlled environment, 
and to ramp up the testing and 
ensure our safety systems are 
functioning and fully vetted,” 
Vozar said. 

Erica Forrest, an engineering 

sophomore 
who 
recently 

became involved with Mcity, 
stressed the importance of 
autonomous vehicle research, 
and expressed how excited she 
was to be a part of this ongoing 
research.

“I think the cause is very 

important, 
just 
because 
of 

how frequently car accidents 
occur, and how dangerous 
driving can be,” Forrest said. 
“I’m a mechanical engineer, 
but I’m also interested in 
entrepreneurship. 
But 
I 

thought that this course was a 
great combination of the two. 
It’s so cool that we have this 
luxury right at our school, and 
I think being able to have this 
opportunity and work with 
professional companies and be 
a part of this exciting program 
is amazing.”

Every Thursday, The Michigan

the campus community. This 
week we asked: What is your 
favorite memory here? 

“One of my favorite 
moments is probably 
my first day working at

I used to work at 
Quality16 but this has 
been much more fun 
and I see more students. 
I like movies a lot too, so 
I like being around that.”

Business sophomore Shartia 

Ducksworth said she enjoyed 
the event, and listening to the 
panelists made her realize she 
should have started applying for 
internships earlier. She also noted 
the diversity of the attendees, 
especially in regard to the usual 
makeup of such events.

“I 
wish 
that 
applying 
to 

internships was something I 
started as a freshman,” she said. 
“I definitely liked how diverse it 
was. That’s not always the case 
when you come to events like 
these.”

Public Policy senior Gloriela 

Iguina-Colón, 
undergraduate 

co-chair of Students of Color in 
Public Policy and one of the event’s 
organizers, 
said 
she 
believes 

students of color on campus need a 
better support network in terms of 
applying for jobs and internships.

“We saw a really big need for a 

support system and network for 
students of color in a professional 
development school,” she said. 
“I had several experiences with 

different events that are really 
engaging, but didn’t make the 
connections with people and 
couldn’t help me professionally. 
So I reached out to Ayana, who 
has been a mentor to me, so Dana 
and I have been collaborating in 
planning this panel.”

After securing an internship 

with 
The 
Hill, 
Iguina-Colón 

explained how she personally 
struggled 
with 
creating 

connections because her identity 
was different from that of anyone 
else in the office. However, this 
experience inspired her to return 
to Ann Arbor and work to create a 
network for others going through 
the same experience.

“No one looked like me in the 

office so creating those bonds was 
difficult,” she said. “I felt like that 
wasn’t supported in any way and I 
felt like it was the first time I was 
supposed to have to search for a 
professional network and support 
system. When I came back I felt 
like it was super important that 
people know we will help them 
get to The Hill, but they have to 
put in work when they get the 
internship. It’s not just about what 
you can add to the internship 
though –– it’s about what you 
can add to yourself and your 
experiences. I feel really happy, 
and Dana has been amazing 
through this whole process.”

Rackham 
student 
Dayna 

Asante-Appiah, an intern at the 

Alumni Scholars program and 
another event organizers, said her 
personal experiences navigating 
the 
workplace 
have 
heavily 

influenced her in choosing to work 
in the field of career counseling.

“As a woman of color myself, 

and as a grad student who desires 
to work with students in the 
future, I think it’s important to be 
able to help students communicate 
and 
navigate 
through 
these 

spaces, even though it’s been 
their experience their whole life. 
Sometimes coming to college and 
being one of the only persons 
of color is a new experience, so 
I have a real passion for career 
counseling and have an internship 
at the career center too,” she said.

Asante-Appiah 
also 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of 
helping 
students 
realize 

the intrinsic value of their 
identities, while simultaneously 
understanding the unfair, but 
realistic, barriers existing in the 
workplace due to said identities.

“I think being able to have 

these 
conversations 
with 

students is important so we 
don’t ignore different aspects 
of our identity –– visible or 
otherwise – and feel confident 
about what they bring to the table 
professional,” she said. “But also 
I want them to know the reality 
that not everyone is going to 
understand or look like you and 
see the value of what you bring.”

of the program in allowing 
students to take control of 
their own ideas and to work 
toward 
gaining 
productive 

support 
from 
those 
in 

positions of power.

“Not enough of us know 

what it means for our public 
servants to fight for us. Not 
enough of us know what it 
means to feel like we have 
our own fate and our own 
wellbeing in our own hands. 
And few, if any of us, know 
what it means to see the 
impact of our representatives 
investing in our ideas. That 
has to change. And that’s why 
we built Innovate,” Sarkar 
said.

One of the kickoff event’s 

speakers was Suneel Gupta, 
vice 
president 
of 
product 

development for Groupon and 
CEO of Rise, a company that 
works to make healthcare more 
affordable through the use of 
technology. He explained to 
the room his own perspectives 
on how to become a successful 
entrepreneur, 
specifically 

through his “Four Chords for 
Founder Mindset.”

Potential 
Innovate 

participants also listened as 
Gupta gave specific tips and 

strategies for working through 
failures and fears. He spoke 
of his own experiences with 
writing ideas and anxieties 
down on paper, for example, 
and 
encouraged 
students 

to 
take 
similar 
measures 

to 
improve 
their 
own 

productivity.

“When 
you 
pull 
things 

out, when you actually start 
putting it down on paper, you 
start to realize that the things 
we fear the most are often 
the same things that are least 
likely to happen,” Gupta said.

University 
students 
also 

joined the lineup of speakers, 
with Engineering sophomore 
Keiana Cavé and LSA senior 
Brendan 
Genaw 
giving 

presentations.

Cavé, who was named one 

of Forbes’ 30 under 30 in 2017, 
discussed her own research 
experiences, 
including 
the 

time she spent a month month 
she spent researching for the 
Smithsonian 
on 
an 
island 

in Panama. She encouraged 
student attendees to persevere 
throughout their journeys, and 
to recognize that processes are 
often much more important 
than the outcomes.

“People 
always 
see 
the 

end 
result, 
and 
especially 

for all of us students, people 
see whatever we list on our 
résumé, but they don’t really 

see how we got there, and 
they don’t know our stories 
necessarily,” Cavé said.

Genaw, who currently serves 

as the president of optiMize, 
an on-campus social impact 
based 
entrepreneurship 

community, expressed similar 
sentiments as he explained 
the importance in remaining 
optimistic and willing to take 
risks.

“A 
lot 
of 
the 
amazing 

entrepreneurs I’ve met are 
people that decide to tell 
themselves 
yes,” 
Genaw 

said. “And when you get a 
community… 
that’s 
always 

going to be telling you yes, 
it makes you willing to try 
things that you might not have 
been able to try.”

LSA 
freshman 
Miriam 

Chung attended the event and 
said the speakers motivated 
her to take on a project 
through Innovate, to work 
toward her own goals and 
gain worthwhile experience 
throughout the process.

“I’m definitely not the type 

of person to take initiative (on 
projects like these),” Chung 
said. “But they were like ‘anyone 
can do it, you just need to start’ 
and I was like okay, maybe we 
can actually do something, even 
if we don’t win, it’s just a chance 
to try and do something, to 
create a project.”

that have contacted us to see 
what we are doing and get 
copies of our questionnaires. 
We’ve been very open with 
them because we want this to 
be something that grows and 
develops. Hopefully at some 
point we can compare across 
institutions.”

A report from Planet Blue, 

the University’s collaborative 
effort to further sustainability 
education, 
research 
and 

operations 
tracked 
positive 

progress 
on 
nearly 
every 

sustainaibility 
goal 
the 

University had set for itself. 
Greenhouse gas emissions, the 
findings detailed, decreased to 
5 percent below the 2006 levels 

last semester Callewaert added 
the over the past years, positive 
trends have clearly emerged 
at the University, particular 
centered around meals.

“There’s been real increases 

of 
awareness 
around 

sustainable food. That’s an 
area where there have been 
positive changes both in terms 
of awareness and behavior, 
and we think that a part of the 
reason for that is there is a lot 
of activity on campus related to 
sustainable food,” Callewaert 
said. “The University has put 
a lot of effort into it and we 
are seeing the results in our 
survey.”

Still, progress has not been 

uniform. For example, student 
transport remains a major issue 
on campus.

“The one area where we have 

seen a decrease over the four 
years is in regard to sustainable 
travel and transportation for 
students,” Callewaert said. “In 
2018, we are asking about Uber 
and Lyft use for the first time.” 

Robert Marans, the survey’s 

other 
principal 
investigator, 

points out that despite the 
steady 
increase 
in 
campus 

sustainability 
awareness, 

taking behavioral steps toward 
sustainability can prove more 
challenging.

“Behavioral 
changes 
have 

been 
slow,” 
Marans 
said. 

“Things haven’t changed that 
much in some areas over the 
past four years as we had 
hoped.”

Fortunately, 
the 
data 

collected 
by 
SCIP 
surveys 

can and are being used by 
organizations 
to 
address 

sustainability issues on campus.

“There’s 
been 
a 
major 

overhaul 
of 
the 
recycling 

and waste containers across 
campus. It’s very clear about 
which items can be recycled,” 
Callewaert said. “The team that 
worked on that was looking at 
SCIP data and results to inform 
their decision making.”

Planet Blue aims to change 

the University’s culture by 
promoting sustainability.

“Few universities are making 

efforts to change the culture, 
which is really what the Planet 
Blue effort is about,” Marans 
said. “Even fewer are trying to 
track the change in culture over 
time, and that’s where the SCIP 
surveys come in.”

Erin Barton, an Environment 

and 
Sustainability 
graduate 

student who works at the 

Graham 
Institute, 
describes 

the importance of the SCIP 
survey in an email interview 
with The Daily.

“In general, social science is 

important for creating a more 
sustainable 
society 
because 

human behavior is a major 
barrier, often more so than 
science and technology,” Barton 
wrote. “We need to understand 
what people do and why they 
do it if we want to facilitate 
positive behavior change.”

The SCIP project is aiming 

for 
2,500 
students, 
1,000 

faculty, and 1,000 staff to fill 
out the survey this semester. 
All 
survey 
responses 
are 

completely 
anonymous 
and 

allow the University to better 
obtain its goal of creating a 
sustainable culture.

Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D-Ward 3) welcomed 
the Supreme Court’s decision. 
He said the community would 
be fighting for a full cleanup 
of the dioxane to prevent it 
from entering the Huron River. 
This challenges the recently-
imposed state requirement that 
Gelman 
Sciences 
keeps 
the 

concentration of the chemical 
below 7.2 parts per billion, 

which is still more than twice 
as high as the Environmental 
Protection 
Agency’s 
posted 

concentration for carcinogenic 
risk.

 “I think it’s expressly the 

goal 
of 
the 
community 
to 

fight for full cleanup, and I’m 
excited that Ann Arbor will 
have the opportunity to fight 
to protect the drinking water 
of the residents we’re sworn to 
protect,” Ackerman said.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Attorney’s Office declined to 
provide comment, based on the 
fact that the litigation between 
the parties was ongoing.

Gelman 
Sciences 
has 

previously acted in attempt 
to negotiate solely with the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Environmental Quality, which 
may more likely to settle for a 
smaller cleanup than the local 
jurisdictions. Laura Rubin, the 
executive director of the Huron 
River Watershed Council, said 
examples like the Flint water 
crisis indicated the agency may 
not be tough enough on similar 
environmental issues.

“I think, like many of the 

other 
partners, 
we 
were 

unhappy with how things were 
going with the cleanup –– 30 

years later and we still have this 
plume,” Rubin said. 

“And I think also, there’s 

no question that Flint and 
the Toledo water crises have 
opened everybody’s eyes to 
sort of reanalyzing whether the 
DEQ and regulatory authorities 
are really doing enough on 
these kinds of issues, and so 
that sparked us to start asking 
harder questions.”

Rubin said it was unusual 

an 
environmental 
nonprofit 

like the Watershed Council 
got a standing in such a case, 
and it faced challenges such as 
Attorney General Bill Schuette 

explicitly arguing against its 
intervention. 
She 
believes 

Supreme Court’s decision set an 
encouraging precedent.

“I think it does open up more 

cases like this, for environmental 
groups to come in, and I see that 
as a huge victory because in this 
political climate, environmental 
regulations and policies are being 
de-emphasized,” 
Rubin 
said. 

“And I think that going forward, 
the 
role 
of 
environmental 

groups, citizens, scientists and 
local governments is one that is 
going to have to step up and be 
more of a watchdog and invest 
more in monitoring.”

A

s 
my 
roommates 

finally 
began 
to 

settle on something 

to watch, I smiled. They had 
chosen one of my 
favorite movies of 
all time, Disney’s 
“Hercules”, and I 
would be able to 
hear it all in the 
background as I 
made 
dinner 
— 

or so I thought. 
Just as the title 
sequence 
began, 

one of them made 
an 
offhanded 

remark 
about 
the 
Muses, 

saying 
something 
along 

the lines of “Wow, I never 
realized when I was younger 
how offensive the portrayal 
of the Muses is!” The heated 
discussion 
that 
followed 

drowned out the vast majority 
of the movie after that.

For those of you with the rare 

misfortune of never having seen 
“Hercules”, the Muses are the 
five women who narrate the 
story. Throughout the movie, 
they add comedy and Motown-
inspired musical numbers. The 
central thesis of my roommates’ 
complaint was that the voices and 
songs they were hearing from 
these characters “sounded Black” 
and I was deeply confused by 
this. The problematic concept of 
“sounding Black” aside, why was 
that necessarily a bad thing, or 
offensive in any way? The voice 
actresses who played the Muses 
were Black, singing in a genre 
that belonged, for the most part, 
to African Americans. They are 
not being portrayed in any kind of 
negative light; they are talented, 
intelligent, confident and playful. 
So what exactly was the matter?

My 
roommates 
were 
right 

to be skeptical, given Disney’s 
track 
record 
of 
questionable 

representations of minority groups, 
from the crows in “Dumbo” to 
the Siamese Cats in “Lady and 

the Tramp” to the Merchant in 
“Aladdin.” What concerned me, 
though, was that the origin of 
their complaint was discomfort 

with Blackness. Without 
interrogating 
it 
or 

articulating their point 
further, they heard a 
stereotypically 
Black 

voice and jumped to the 
assumption that it was 
not okay.

It is easy enough, 

though, 
in 
the 

sociopolitical world of 
a campus liberal, to err 
on the side of caution 

and adopt these responses. That 
is, as a student on campus who is 
not a person of color or part of the 
LGBTQ community or belonging 
to a religious minority group, 
when one sees a questionable 
representation in the media, the 
primary goal is to find out what, 
if anything, is wrong with it. In 
most cases, the most “woke,” 
most culturally sensitive thing 
to do is identify it, immediately 
determine the degree of offense 
such a representation may have 
caused (on a sliding scale, usually, 
from “potentially problematic” 
to “downright racist”) and then 
share your judgement with those 
around you.

This cannot be a healthy 

mechanism. In fact, it is a 
Pavlovian shortcut that too many 
use as an excuse to not tackle 
more complex, serious questions 
about cultural appropriation and 
how underrepresented groups are 
portrayed in the media.

Watching 
“Hercules” 
with 

my roommates was far from my 
first experience like this. Several 
times I have been in a room of 
well-meaning, relatively “woke” 
liberal people where questions 
like that will come up and, more 
often than not, a room full of white 
people will end up walking away 
taking umbrage with a character, 
accent or representation that the 
affected group might not find 

offensive at all.

In a certain sense, this is 

progress 
and 
perhaps 
even 

something to be celebrated. This 
socioeconomic and demographic 
group is paying great attention, 
maybe for the first time ever, to 
these issues and thinking about 
whether or not they contribute to 
an inclusive, respectful society.

But isn’t this, on some level, 

the easy way out? Assuming 
that something is racist may be 
objectively a good bet and it may 
help someone feel more confident 
in their political leanings, but at 
the end of the day, it is far from the 
hard work of empathy and research 
that should be taking place. Doesn’t 
this sort of automatically generated 
response miss the point?

Existing 
in 
2018 
as 
an 

empathetic, progressive, “woke” 
person is, and should be, hard 
work. You should be able to 
look at your own responses and 
interrogate them. “Why did I 
notice 
this 
representation 
of 

Blackness? Is it because it made me 
slightly uncomfortable and I did 
not know how to react?” Or, “Does 
this 
character’s 
recognizably 

gay voice demean them in any 
way, does it reflect an unfair 
stereotype?” These are much more 
suitable, nuanced questions than 
the bottom-line “Is it offensive? If 
yes, how offensive?”

If you think you may be guilty 

of 
this 
Pavlovian 
progressive 

behavior, take a breath. You have 
the best of intentions, and that is 
a great place to begin. Next time 
you have one of these discussions, 
rather than passing judgement 
without a second thought and 
moving 
on, 
interrogate 
that 

instinct. See if you can complete 
the sentence “This is offensive 
because ______.” If you struggle to 
articulate the second part of that, 
chances are you are not as woke as 
you may have thought you were.

I

n the wake of President 
Donald 
Trump 
calling 

Haiti, 
El 
Salvador 
and 

nations 
in 
Africa 
“shithole 

countries” 
when 
discussing 

immigration 
policy, 
people 

from these countries have 
been 
extolled 
by 
figures 

in the media as having an 
unparalleled 
resiliency, 

especially 
compared 
to 
a 

president who has never had 
to make a serious effort at 
achieving anything.

These 
comments 
are 

warranted 
considering 

how 
the 
Haitian 
people 

have not only faced endless 
tribulations, but have been 
held as poverty porn and 
perpetuated as an immutably 
destitute nation by all sides of 
the media. Anderson Cooper 
became 
visibly 
emotional 

when describing the island 
nation 
on 
CNN, 
exalting 

their 
vibrant 
culture 
and 

incontrovertible 
sense 
of 

strength and pride.

Members 
of 
several 
of 

these nations, including Haiti, 
responded 
by 
denouncing 

Trump’s 
comments 
as 

“abhorrent 
and 
obnoxious 

remarks.” 
The 
Senegalese 

president tweeted “Africa and 
the black race deserve the 
respect and consideration of all,” 
an innocuous request yet likely 
impossible for the repugnantly 
disrespectful Trump.

However, the disheartening 

aspect of this (aside from the 
reaffirmation that a blatantly 
racist man holds our highest 
office) is that we have come 
to a moment where we must 
exalt the values of citizens of 
different countries in response 
to racism within our nation’s 
highest office.

This 
is 
something 
that 

Americans of all stripes have 
had to confront daily, whether 
it be the xenophobic comments 
from our commander-in-chief 
or the Justice Department’s 
intent to deport hundreds of 
thousands of children who’ve 
lived in the United States 
under DACA. It would be 
comforting to imagine that 
on campus, we don’t have to 

support someone’s right to 
live, and to breathe and exist 
peacefully without someone 
threatening 
this 
ostensibly 

inalienable right.

This 
also 
has 
impacted 

campus 
as 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
indicates 
a 

willingness 
to 
provide 
a 

platform for white supremacist 
Richard Spencer to speak, 
suggesting that our supposedly 
safe 
campus 
is 
instead 

becoming a symposium for 
this same kind of existential 
deliberation. The University’s 
decision to offer dates for 
Spencer 
to 
visit 
campus 

undermines their once pro-
student stance that serves 
minorities and marginalized 
groups. To avoid the risk of 
a lawsuit, they instead have 
chosen to let students ruminate 
over 
whether 
or 
not 
the 

larger Michigan community 
respects their rights with a 
haphazardly contrite message 
from 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel.

This seems discordant with 

a University that has disputed 
the policies of the Trump 
administration by promoting 
the safety of undocumented 
students. Why would Schlissel 
seem invested in the protection 
of 
marginalized 
students 

on one issue, yet apparently 
unconcerned by another?

Classrooms have swelled 

up with questions of safety. 
Last 
semester, 
in 
several 

of my discussions, Jewish 
students and students of color 
collectively 
discussed 
not 

just whether or not Spencer 
should march onto campus 
but 
also 
how 
they 
don’t 

deserve the emotional and 
likely physical stress that will 
accompany an appearance by 
the bigoted nationalist.

Questions 
of 
whether 

Spencer’s 
appearance 

would 
turn 
into 
another 

Charlottesville 
became 

central to the discussion. This 
conjured harrowing images of 
tiki torches and anti-Semitic 
or racial slurs polluting the air 
of Ann Arbor; in this dystopian 
scene, 
the 
Diag 
suddenly 

morphs into a platform for 
Nazis and white supremacists 
to 
intimidate 
and 
aggress 

students of color and the 
Jewish community.

The most prominent aspect 

of the argument became less 
of a point of debate and more 
of a plea: to recognize the fear 
these groups shared if swaths 
of racist, torch-holding white 
supremacists 
arose 
when 

Spencer visits campus.

Why are students having to 

justify their existence to the 
University? This is the point 
we’ve reached on this campus, 
with students postulating the 
damage and violence they 
may 
face 
should 
Spencer 

arrive. Furthermore, racist 
demonstrations and acts have 
shown to have increasingly 
negative effects on mental 
health, 
with 
communities 

of 
color 
reporting 
higher 

rates 
of 
depression 
and 

suicide 
because 
of 
these 

aggressions. Must we even 
bring these statistics into the 
conversation to justify why 
students are concerned?

This unsettling argument 

feels akin to people defending 
the lives of Haitians when 
Trump conflates the identity 
of their country with a latrine.

These watershed moments 

feel indicative of the values 
we will continue to hold, like 
a fork in the road. Racism so 
apparent confronts us, and to 
fight back we must rationalize 
why people aren’t “shitholes” 
and why all humans, whether 
on our campus or having 
emigrated 
to 
our 
country, 

deserve equal chances.

Individuals 
of 
all 
races 

should not be forced to justify 
their right to live by defending 
their character. Yet in this 
country, much like at this 
University, we have been forced 
to wrestle with our officials 
and administration just to 
justify a right of existence. 
And that is a depressing sign 
of where we have gone and are 
continuing to go. 

The justification of the right to exist

E

arlier this month, H&M 
sparked 
outrage 
when 

an image appeared on its 

online store featuring a Black child 
modeling a sweatshirt that read 
“coolest monkey in the jungle.” 
Two white child models were 
featured on the site also wearing 
jungle-themed 
sweatshirts, 

but their sweatshirts did not 
reference monkeys. The retailer 
quickly removed the image, said 
it would pull the sweatshirt from 
its stores and posted an online 
apology stating, “Our product 
and promotion were not intended 
to cause offence but, as a global 
brand, we have a responsibility 
to be aware of and attuned to all 
racial and cultural sensitivities — 
and we have not lived up to this 
responsibility this time.”

However, it was too late. The 

damage had been done. Musical 
artist The Weeknd and rapper 
G-Eazy announced they would 
no 
longer 
be 
working 
with 

H&M. 
LeBron 
James 
posted 

an Instagram photo expressing 
his disdain for the ad. Shortly 
thereafter, members of the South 
African political party Economic 
Freedom Fighters protested at 
several H&M stores, marching 
through stores, breaking mirrors, 
knocking over mannequins and 
racks and throwing clothes around. 
When H&M subsequently closed 
several locations for safety reasons, 
Floyd 
Shivambu, 
the 
deputy 

president of the EFF, tweeted, “All 
the stores of that racist retailer 
@hmsouthafrica are CLOSED. 
Racism must fall and we will never 
tip toe around racists.”

When friends and I discussed 

the 
protests, 
our 
unanimous 

response was they were ridiculous. 
We agreed we loved that overt 
racism is no longer profitable, 
that it’s unacceptable to use racial 
slurs and that if you do, whether 
or not it was intentional, people 
respond negatively. But we said 
that if people think for a second 
that H&M created that sweatshirt 
to promote racism, they don’t 
understand a thing about how 
business works. H&M exists solely 
to make money, not to promote 
any political agenda. Even if every 
single executive at H&M was racist, 
they still wouldn’t intentionally 
put a racist slogan on a sweatshirt 
because they know they wouldn’t 

make money off of it. H&M just 
wants to make money. The slogan 
was clearly an oversight.

However, what we neglected to 

acknowledge was how absurd it 
is that H&M is in a position that 
allows such an oversight to be 
possible. Yes, the EFF protests 
were 
extreme 
and 
arguably 

counterintuitive. But today I 
would tell business executives 
the same thing I tell my 12-year-
old campers: “You can’t control 
how people treat you, but you 
can control how you respond 
to it.” Maybe knocking down 
racks of clothing was an unduly 
destructive response to a slogan 
on a sweatshirt, but you can’t 
control if people protest your 
mistake. What you can control, 
however, is how much effort you 

put toward ensuring you never 
again make a mistake people deem 
worthy of protesting.

I assume the people involved 

with the photo did not consider its 
racial implications when making 
their decisions — if they did, then 
we’re facing a different problem 
because the people at H&M aren’t 
just racist, they are ignorant. More 
than likely, though, this photo 
passed through a whole team of 
professionals who didn’t have the 
life experiences to lead them to 
think twice about the way it may 
be perceived. So many people have 
been the victim of racial slurs; if 
just one of them had been on the 
team that created this photo, and 
had been in a position where they 
felt that their perspective was 
valued, the photo would have been 
reconsidered and H&M wouldn’t 
be facing the biggest marketing 
disaster of its existence.

In case you were wondering, 

H&M’s board of directors is all 
white. Its CEO and CFO are both 
white. Its auditing committee is 

all white. I don’t know exactly 
who was on the team that created 
this photo, but H&M is a global 
brand with locations in Africa, 
the Middle East, Oceania, Europe, 
Asia and the Americas. And yet 
you would be hard-pressed to find 
a high-level employee of any race 
besides white.

McKinsey’s 
2015 
report 

titled “Why diversity matters” 
explains, “Companies in the top 
quartile for racial and ethnic 
diversity are 35 percent more 
likely to have financial returns 
above their respective national 
industry medians.”

“Companies in the bottom 

quartile both for gender and for 
ethnicity and race are statistically 
less likely to achieve above-
average financial returns than 
the average companies in the 
data set (that is, bottom-quartile 
companies are lagging rather than 
merely not leading),” it states.

This is why diversity matters. 

It is the same reason we need 
a more diverse student body at 
the University of Michigan, the 
same reason we need to ensure 
America’s youth are presented 
with equal opportunities. We 
will likely never reach a point 
in our nation where all citizens 
champion 
diversity 
simply 

because it’s the right thing to 
do. When our institutions and 
businesses are diverse, they are 
better equipped to meet the needs 
of a wide variety of cultures and 
individuals. But regardless of 
whether people recognize the 
innate value of diversity, nobody 
can deny the free market is a 
microcosm of the culture, and the 
culture right now is a culture of 
social justice.

Racism, whether unintentional 

or intentional, violent or seemingly 
harmless, is no longer profitable. 
If you do appear racist, then the 
markets are going to respond 
negatively. If you want to succeed 
as a business, then you can either 
hope and pray your homogenous 
staff doesn’t make some critical 
oversight like H&M did, or you 
can create a diverse workplace 
environment that reflects the 
company’s consumer base.

H&M needs diversity

Freshmen key in Michigan’s win over Ohio State

All athletes dream of rivalry 

wins and upsets.

The 
freshmen 
on 
the 

Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team have had one of each — in 
just two meets.

Better yet, two freshmen 

— 
Lauren 
Farley 
and 
Syd 

Townsend — played integral 
roles in both those wins. And 
they still have potential for 
improvement.

Though both suffered falls 

last week against then-No. 4 
Alabama, their performances 
in Saturday’s meet against Ohio 
State showed no hints of their 
first-meet struggles. And both 
were major contributors to the 
Wolverines’ final score of 197.55 
— the highest in the nation so 
far.

Both Townsend and Farley 

earned spots in the starting 
lineups on two different events 
against the Buckeyes. Townsend 
competed on vault and bars 
while Farley performed on bars 
and beam.

And 
Sam 
Javanbakht 
— 

a freshman who has yet to 
make her collegiate debut — 
contributed in a different way, 
making sure the team kept up its 
energy and focus.

“Everyone’s stepping up, all 

the freshmen,” said junior Emma 
McLean. “Even if people aren’t 
competing, they’re stepping up 
and they’re cheering and they’re 
contributing … it’s gonna take us 
far.”

For 
Townsend, 
a 
former 

Canadian national team member, 
the team-focused environment 
of the NCAA is a stark contrast 
to her previous experiences.

“In Canada, we were part 

of a team, but everyone kinda 
individually wanted what was 
best for themselves,” Townsend 
said. “Here, everyone genuinely 
wants you to do well and wants 
you to succeed because it would 
benefit the team.”

Michigan’s 
camaraderie 

helped Townsend bounce back 
from a fall on vault last week. 
This week, she earned a 9.925, 
the second-highest vault score of 
the meet.

“Knowing that they actually 

do have my back and they can 
pull out the score if I mess up … 
was awesome,” Townsend said.

Despite leading off on the 

uneven bars — a position in the 
lineup that often garners lower 
scores — Townsend received the 
highest score on the event with 
a 9.90. Farley’s score wasn’t far 
behind with a steady set.

But where she really had 

the chance to shine was on 
beam. She showcased a unique 
beam routine featuring a back-
handspring-layout-stepout-
layout-stepout flight series and a 
Gainer pike dismount.

“That 
beam 
routine 
was 

great,” said Michigan coach Bev 
Plocki. “This is her first time in 
the bar lineup, she rocked it, and 
she’s right there in the mix on 
floor as well, so really proud.”

And though floor was the only 

rotation that didn’t feature any 
freshmen Saturday night, that 
could change soon.

After scoring had concluded, 

Townsend 
performed 
an 

exhibition routine on the floor 
exercise. It was a test run of 

sorts, a chance to practice in 
front of the crowd and see how 
she would be scored by real 
judges, but without the pressure 
of having her score count.

Townsend’s score of 9.80 

showed an ability to hang 
with the team’s veterans — no 
easy task on the Wolverines’ 
historically-strongest event.

“We 
were 
contemplating 

putting her in the lineup,” Plocki 
said. “(But) in order to earn your 
way, you have to exhibition first.”

Last season, Michigan lost 

two of its strongest floor workers 
in Talia Chiarelli and Nicole 
Artz, leaving big shoes to fill. 
So while Townsend’s floor is 
currently a depth option, it has 
the potential to become much 
more than that.

“She’s one that still has a lot 

left in the tank,” Plocki said. 
“We have a lot I think we can 
still improve upon with her.”

In a sport like gymnastics, it’s 

often hard to know how much 
the freshmen will contribute. 
But as their two big wins 
demonstrated, the Wolverines 
don’t have much to worry about.

Seniors show out in loss

In a head-to-head dual for first 

place, Evan White pushed forward 
to close the gap of centimeters 
between him and the frontrunner, 
Indiana’s Vini Lanza. With the 
crowd rallying behind White, the 
senior gave a last hurrah in the 
final lap.

He came up short.
Just as White had, the No. 8 

Michigan men’s swimming team 
fell to the fourth-ranked Hoosiers 
in a close dual meet despite giving 
its best efforts. Though the seniors 
put the team in a contending 
position, the Wolverines couldn’t 
come out on top.

Despite the loss, Michigan 

rose to the occasion. Coach Mike 
Bottom claimed that the team had 
“one of their fastest dual meets by 
far on the men’s side and women’s 
side.” However, rising even higher 
was Indiana, who also had one of 
its fastest dual meets on both sides.

Other silver linings of the day for 

Michigan were key performances 
from two of its seniors captains — 
PJ Ransford and White.

Putting on a show for the 200- 

and 100-yard Butterfly, White 
came out on top for one of two 
close contests and placed second 
on the other. Despite the result of 
the 200-yard, he had the claim 
to a first-place finish throughout, 
falling just short in final moments 
of the last lap. He finished with a 
1:44.30, just .45 seconds from the 
winning time.

However, rather than feeling 

down about his flawed finish in the 
200-yard Butterfly, he entered his 
next event, the 100-yard Butterfly 
with a clear mind and intense 
focus. Determined to bounce back, 
he came from behind to overtake 
Lanza in the final lap, finishing 
with a 46.47, a tenth of a second 
faster than the second-place finish.

Instead of taking in the cheers 

or getting distracted by results and 
emotions from the first race, White 
admitted that only one thought 
ran through his mind as he swam: 

“Just try hard and score points for 
Michigan.”

Likewise, 
Ransford 
had 
a 

similar approach to the meet. A 
slow starter — Bottom noted that 
Ransford “normally kinda sits 
back and builds into it” — Ransford 
chose to go head first into action in 
both his races, claiming the lead 
early into the laps.

Knowing that he had to score 

points on the distance races, 
Ransford took it upon himself to 
try and give the Wolverines the 
advantage. Keeping scoring on 
his mind, he came out fast while 
controlling the pace to dominate 
the competition.

“What a great swim he had, 

both the 500-yard and the mile,” 
Bottom said. “Both of those were 
great swims. He went out for it, 
he didn’t mess around, did he? He 
went out for it. This time I think he 
wanted it. He wanted it bad.”

His desire to win showed, as he 

finished the 1,000-yard freestyle a 
near half-lap ahead of any Indiana 
swimmer — coming in at 9:01.88.

“First half of the season, it’s 

tough because you’re working 
really hard,” Ransford said. “The 
second half, you start to do a bit 
more speedwork. And I was hitting 
my stroke count really well. But it 
is nice in a race to jump on it and 
be able to tell halfway that we’re 
going to get first, second for sure.”

Being able to see the surefire 

victory provided relief to Ransford 
as he witnessed a sweep in the 
500-yard freestyle, with Michigan 
claiming the top three times. With 
a time of 4:23.03, Ransford paved 
the way for the underclassmen to 
follow.

Despite 
their 
individual 

achievements, the Wolverines were 
neither pleased nor disappointed 
with their performance.

“It’s always tough to take a loss 

at home, but Indiana is a great 
team,” White said. “I think all our 
guys showed strong mentalities 
and no one was down after. It was 
in season. It was just good racing 
and practice for the end of the 
season.”

MEN’S SWIMMING AND DIVE

With road wins, ‘M’ all but seals tournament berth

W

hatever validation 
the Michigan wom-
en’s basketball team 

needed, it 
got — and 
then some.

The 

Wolverines 
went on 
the road 
this week 
with March 
hanging 
in the bal-
ance. No. 
19 Michi-
gan (5-2 Big Ten, 16-4 overall) 
had no need to worry about 
the NCAA Tournament until 
recently. The Wolverines 
waltzed through their non-
conference slate, the only slip-
ups coming against Louisville 
and Notre Dame, two of the top 
five teams in the country.

Big Ten play started well 

enough — two easy wins with 
a loss at then-No. 23 Iowa 
sandwiched between them. But 
after dropping a close one to 
then-No. 10 Ohio State in Ann 
Arbor and narrowly escaping 
against unranked Indiana, a 

two-game road trip was the 
opposite of what Michigan 
needed.

Adding to the loss column 

against a formidable Nebraska 
team and the eighth-ranked 
Buckeyes would have put the 
Wolverines below .500 in the 
Big Ten. The margin for error 
would have been all but gone 
with just nine games left in the 
regular season. And, for a team 
that lost out on the Tourna-
ment last season after dropping 
three of their last four and 
exiting in the first round of the 
Big Ten Tournament, familiar 
alarm bells would have rang 
through Crisler Center.

When Michigan boarded the 

plane to Lincoln last Friday, it 
was staring down the possibili-
ty of moving to the tournament 
bubble and going through the 
whole ordeal again.

Down three with eight sec-

onds to go against the Corn-
huskers, that possibility was 
inches away from becoming 
reality.

After a timeout, Michigan 

ran a pick-and-pop with senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty and 

freshman forward Hailey 
Brown. Nebraska’s Jasmine 
Cincore got over the screen and 
nothing opened up. The ball 
found freshman guard Deja 
Church, who had no choice 
but to attempt a desperation 
3-pointer as the clock reached 
its final second. She was fouled 
— a lifeline — and sunk all 
three free throws to tie it.

“I was almost in disbelief,” 

coach Kim Barnes Arico told 
WTKA. “I wasn’t sure that 
she would be able to do it. But 
you know what’s funny about 
her is that she made every big 
play — like she seems to have a 
knack.”

For the rest of the trip, the 

Wolverines never looked back.

Michigan ran away with the 

game in overtime, then went to 
Columbus and came back from 
a 10-point first-half deficit 
to beat Ohio State on its own 
court. It was only the fifth time 
the Wolverines have beaten a 
top-10 team in program his-
tory.

“We went right to a pick-

and-roll option where we had 
a high blast to try to get Hallie 

(Thome) the ball inside, and 
we were able to do it the first 
couple possessions (of the sec-
ond half),” Barnes Arico said. 
“Then they tried to pack it in 
the paint and once they did 
that, we were able to kick and 
find Katelynn.”

Thome and Flaherty fin-

ished as Michigan’s leading 
scorers, putting up 27 and 21 
points, respectively, with 18 of 
Flaherty’s total coming in the 
second half as the Wolverines 
mounted their comeback and 
pulled away en route to an 
84-75 win.

Instead of the bubble, Michi-

gan returned to Ann Arbor 
with a tournament bid all but 
official.

Instead of a collapse, the 

Wolverines rose to the occa-
sion.

With a signature win under 

their belt and the season’s 
toughest road trip out of the 
way, the rest is simple: Hold 
the line and Michigan is in.

AARON BAKER/Daily

Freshman guard Deja Church was clutch for Michigan in its win over Nebraska last week, sinking three free throws to send the game to overtime.

‘M’ a piece away from top

Friday’s wrestling meet was 

about as close as you’d ever see, 
but you would never know by 
looking at the final score.

The score also couldn’t show 

you how thunderous the cheers 
were throughout Crisler Center, 
the 
close 
matches 
against 

defending national champions 
or the boisterous disapproval of 
controversial calls.

No. 1 Penn State (2-0 Big Ten, 

6-0 overall) was, in the end, 
more aggressive and technically 
sound than the eighth-ranked 
Michigan wrestling team (2-1, 
5-2), eventually topping them, 
25-12.

The 
Wolverines’ 
three 

wins of the meet came from 
freshman Drew Mattin at 125 
pounds, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Stevan Micic at 133 pounds and 
fifth-year senior Adam Coon at 
heavyweight.

Michigan took the first two 

matches of the night with relative 
ease as Mattin and Micic each 
earned major decisions to put the 
Wolverines up 8-0. However, this 
was the calm before the storm, 
as Michigan went on to drop 
the next seven matchups — five 
of them to defending national 
champions.

The Wolverines did not have 

momentum on their side, as it 
eluded the team all night despite 
the largest home crowd they have 
ever seen. The Nittany Lions 
consistently began each match 
aggressively, as nearly every 
Penn State wrestler was able to 
secure a takedown early on.

“In every match the guy who 

scored the first takedown won 
the match,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “That shows you 
how important getting that first 
takedown is and getting that 
momentum on your side.”

In what may have been the 

quintessential match of the night, 
redshirt junior Alec Pantaleo fell, 
6-4, to Jason Nolf, the defending 
national champion and top-
ranked wrestler at 157 pounds.

The match began like any 

other that night as Nolf scored 

a quick takedown at the start 
of the first period. After Nolf’s 
escape to start the second period, 
Pantaleo started a difficult uphill 
climb with a takedown of his 
own. Down only a point heading 
into the third, Pantaleo elected 
to start in the down position, a 
decision he would later regret 
as Nolf held onto him for the 
remainder of the match for a 6-4 
win.

“You can say it was a bad 

decision all you want,” Pantaleo 
said. “But from last year I’ve 
made big strides, and I was really 
confident when I chose bottom.”

Ultimately, this sentiment may 

have been indicative of the match 
as a whole: Michigan was on the 
cusp but could not match up to 
the Nittany Lions’ near-technical 
perfection.

Now 
that 
the 
Wolverines 

have faced the top team in the 
nation and know what it takes 
both mentally and physically to 
wrestle with the best, they are 
optimistic about their chances 
the next time they see Penn State 
on the mat.

“I’m looking forward to seeing 

the video review to see what I did 
wrong so I can fix it,” Pantaleo 
said. “There’s so much that we 
can watch on video to see how 
they’re doing it and not let it 
happen again.”

All in all, this match was a 

gargantuan battle that justified 
the switch from the quaint Cliff 
Keen Arena to Crisler Center on 
Friday. Additionally, while it may 
seem fruitless now, the energy in 
Crisler undoubtedly galvanized 
Michigan 
and 
instilled 
a 

previously unknown energy.

“Finally getting in here it was 

really exciting,” Coon said. “We 
were all just really amped up, 
ready to go for a big dual against 
the returning national champs, 
but there were nerves and 
excitement as well — we were just 
amped up.”

Added McFarland: “It’s a great 

atmosphere in here, you can feel 
it — our fans showed up and it 
was a great atmosphere. I wish 
we could’ve win a few more of 
those close ones, but it just wasn’t 
in the cards I guess.”

After attrition-filled offseason, Miles rights Nebraska’s ship

It’s 9 a.m. at Big Ten Media 

Day. The coffee is flowing, the 
breakfast line is starting to die 
down, 
electrical 
outlets 
are 

reaching a dangerous premium.

Big Ten commissioner Jim 

Delaney is finishing up his 
opening remarks filled with 
details on the new 20-game 
schedule, the new location for 
the Big Ten Tournament and the 
state of the conference; details 
are fresh but are simultaneously 
hollow in intrigue for the dreary-
eyed media members.

Nebraska 
basketball 
coach 

Tim Miles walks on stage and 
ears perk up.

“They always have me early. I 

feel like I’m the ‘Good Morning 
Vietnam’ guy,” Miles says. “But I 
love following the commissioner. 
You know a guy is highly 
intelligent when he can say that 
much and say that little.”

He goes on.
“We’re picked 13th by most of 

you in this room and some others, 
and that’s fine. I think we’re 
going to outperform that.”

And we’re off.
That’s 
Tim 
Miles: 
Brash, 

candid, unfazed. His personality 
attracts him to 
media and fans, 
even if it alone 
does little to help 
Nebraska 
win 

basketball games.

As 
he 
fields 

and 
answers 

questions 
from 

the hundreds of 
media members 
in 
attendance, 

Miles knows he’s 
on the hot seat.

The Cornhuskers are coming 

off a season in which they lost 
twice as many conference games 
as they won. Nebraska lost its 
final five games of the season, 
including a first round Big 
Ten Tournament loss to Penn 

State. Only Rutgers finished 
worse. 
From 
there, 
things 

only deteriorated. During the 

offseason, Miles 
lost seven players 
from his roster — 
two 
graduated, 

three transferred 
and two walk-ons 
chose to walk off.

The 
player 

attrition offered 
the 
most 

damning account 
of the Tim Miles 
era to date; his 

program appeared to be a sinking 
ship devoid of life rafts.

In a conference with two 

legitimate Final Four contenders 
and 
plenty 
of 
blossoming 

storylines, Miles’ Nebraska team 
falls mighty low on the list of 
priorities for the day.

But in a day flooded with 

coachspeak, you can’t help but 
find yourself seeking out the 
loudest coach at the table in the 
furthest corner either doesn’t 
have a filter or doesn’t care 
enough to abide by it.

Miles 
vacillates 
between 

lawyer 
jokes 
and 
roster 

breakdowns. 
One 
moment 

he’s playfully bantering with 
reporters, the next he’s detailing 
the 
gut-wrenching 
feeling 

of learning he was losing yet 
another of his players.

“And you really feel like you 

see one of those movies with 
‘Too Big to Fail’ or whatever it 
might be,” Miles says. “You feel 
you’re in the room with the Wall 
Street bankers saying this can’t 
be happening.”

It can be easy to forget the 

momentum Miles had early in 

his tenure in Lincoln. He led the 
Cornhuskers to a 19-13 record — 
and a fourth place finish in the Big 
Ten — in 2013-14, 
his second season 
with the program. 
That 
offseason, 

he signed three 
four-star recruits 
and 
registered 

the 
27th 
best 

recruiting 
class 

in 
the 
country, 

according 
to 

247Sports. 

Perhaps 
that’s 

easy to forget because in the 
three seasons since, Nebraska 
has won just 17 Big Ten games 
and finished no better than 11th 
in the conference. Not only had 
the momentum disappeared, it 
took a serious downward spiral.

Miles had to grapple with the 

reality that the program he had 
so carefully crafted — a program 
that had reached the NCAA 

Tournament just 
two years prior 
— was ripping at 
the seams. 

Instead 
of 

dwelling 
on 

it, he used the 
mass exodus as a 
rallying cry. 

“More 
than 

anything I think 
that galvanized 
us, 
going 

through those moments together, 
figuring out, alright, ‘who is 
really in here and why are you 
in?’ … What’s interesting about 
it is this team is probably more 
cohesive than any team I’ve had 
now in about three or four years, 
what’s left.”

“Cohesion” is one of those 

buzz words that coaches love 
to use. Most teams are cohesive 
in October, and it’s an easy trait 
to praise when all else fails. But 
amidst roster turnover and job 
uncertainty, Miles meant it.

“I’m going to come through 

for (former Nebraska athletic 
director Shawn Eichorst),” Miles 
told media shortly after Eichorst 
announced the 51-year-old coach 
would return for another season. 
“We’re going to show him his 
faith in us is justified.”

Eichorst has since been fired as 

athletic director, only ratcheting 
up the pressure for Miles to prove 
his capabilities to his new boss, 
Bill Moos.

The decision was less a vote 

of confidence from the former 
athletic director than a shot 
across the bow. Win now, or don’t 
return to Media Day next year.

Against the odds, Miles and 

his team are doing just that. With 
a win over Illinois on Monday, 
Nebraska earned its 13th win, 
already one more than it did all of 
last season. 

Heading into the matchup 

with Michigan on Thursday, the 
Cornhuskers sit above .500 in Big 
Ten play, comfortably slated for 
their best season since the 2013-
14 season that offered the promise 
of a Miles-led “Nebrasketball” 
rennaisance.

Nebraska is winning close 

games — by one against Illinois, 
by four against Wisconsin, by 
four at Mississippi State, by 10 
against Minnesota. It has lost 
only once at home in a nail-biting, 
one-point loss to No. 10 Kansas. 

And a win over Michigan 

Thursday would do far more than 
notch a fifth conference win. It 
would signal intent. It would 
change the present complexion 
of Cornhuskers basketball. It 
might just secure Miles’ job.

If that happens, Tim Miles 

might have a little more than a 
good lawyer joke to tell at Media 
Day next year.

Nebraska coach Tim Miles has his team sitting in sixth place in the Big Ten with a 4-3 conference record., only one season removed from finishing next-to-last.

Warren’s breakout weekend the link to sweep

The Michigan hockey team has 

found its own version of Miami’s 
infamous “Turnover Chain.” The 
Wolverines carry a chain around 
for weekend series, symbolizing 
that they are only as strong as their 
weakest link.

And in Michigan’s conquest at 

Minnesota last weekend, junior 
forward Brendan Warren was the 
link holding the chain together. 
The junior’s three-goal outburst 
helped 
the 
now-20th-ranked 

Wolverines complete a sweep of 
the Golden Gophers at Mariucci 
Arena for the first time in 41 years.

Warren notched Michigan’s 

fourth and fifth goals Friday 
night, including the eventual 
game-winner, to bury then-No. 
9 Minnesota, 5-3. Twenty-four 
hours later, just 1:13 into Saturday’s 
contest, he scored again to catalyze 
the Wolverines’ 3-1 victory.

Warren has already eclipsed 

his career high with six goals this 
season. His .158 shot percentage is 
more than double his sophomore 
campaign’s clip and three times 
his freshman output. Against the 
Golden Gophers, Warren took just 
three shots all weekend, but each 
one found the back of the net.

Even with his recent uptick in 

offensive involvement, Warren 
credits his teammates for feeding 
him in prime shooting areas — and 
a little bit of “puck luck.”

“Team success usually leads 

to individual success, so that was 
something that helped me out,” 
Warren 
said 
after 
Tuesday’s 

practice. 
“My 
linemates 
also 

helped, playing hard and playing 
with speed, getting the pucks to 
me and putting the pressure on 
Minnesota so that I could get more 
opportunities myself.”

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

often talks about players who are 
“natural goal-scorers” and can 
create these opportunities for 
themselves. 
Warren, 
however, 

isn’t typically on that list.

Instead, the Carleton, Mich. 

native is a skater who flies under 
the 
radar, 
his 
contributions 

minimally 
reflected 
on 
the 

scoreboard.

“He’s hitting guys, he’s moving 

his feet, he’s blocking shots, he’s 

on the penalty kill,” said senior 
forward Tony Calderone. “He does 
everything that doesn’t show up, 
but is a huge part of our team. It’ll 
be good to see how he progresses.”

Warren’s 
speed 
is 
evident 

during games. He wins battles on 
both sides of the ice, scrums in the 
corner and in front of his own net. 
He leads all Michigan forwards 
with 22 blocked shots and has a 
textbook shot with a quick and 
smooth release.

Until last weekend, Warren 

didn’t have many chances to put 
that shot to use. But following 
a shoulder injury to sophomore 
forward Will Lockwood during 
last 
month’s 
World 
Junior 

Championships, that all changed. 
With Lockwood’s season most 
likely finished, Warren replaced 
the left winger on the second line.

And just three games into his 

new role alongside linemates 
junior Jake Slaker and freshman 
Josh Norris, Warren has already 
displayed the stroke coaches and 
players regularly praise.

Pearson has stressed hitting 

the net and not forcing bad-
angle shots to help reverse the 
Wolverines’ recent goal-scoring 
slumps. Warren has caught on to 
that message and it has shown.

“Too many times, you miss the 

net when you’re trying to pick the 
perfect spot,” Pearson said. “Just 

make sure you get it away quick, 
under-handle the puck and get it 
on the net. And I think that was 
really the key for Brendan.”

Success breeds even higher 

expectations, and Pearson has 
openly challenged the new-look 
trio to continue its offensive surge.

“They look good and they’ve got 

all the ingredients you look for in 
a line,” Pearson said. “They’ve got 
defensive responsibility, speed, 
scoring, playmaking, so it’s nice 
to see them have some results. 
Get some results and then that 
encourages them and gives them 
more confidence.

“We haven’t had that line 

together other than the three 
games, but they’ve gotten the 
opportunity in the three games 
and they’ve scored. That’s a real 
positive. They have a chance to be 
our best line.”

Despite never playing on a top 

line on a roster full of branded 
superstars, Warren’s solid all-
around game has already been 
noticed. He was selected by the 
Arizona Coyotes in the third round 
of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft and 
prior to the 2017 draft, his rights 
were traded to the Philadelphia 
Flyers.

For his dominant weekend in 

Minneapolis, Warren was named 
the Big Ten First Star of the Week. 
According to his teammates, the 

recent accolades are long-awaited 
and well-deserved for the player 
who does it all on the ice, but is 
frequently overlooked.

“He’s a guy who works hard 

every night,” Calderone said. “He 
might not be rewarded on the 
scoresheet, but he does all the 
little things, so it’s nice to see him 
actually get rewarded. I think with 
a little bit of confidence now, that 
could leap him into a good second 
half here.”

Added junior forward Cooper 

Marody, also a Flyer prospect: 
“Brendan is playing awesome, just 
working his butt off. He’s a guy 
who doesn’t get a lot of recognition 
that he deserves.”

Pearson called for secondary 

contributors to be factors heading 
into the Minnesota series. Warren 
answered. Now, he must ride 
the current momentum entering 
a gauntlet of showdowns with 
top-ranked conference foes in 
upcoming weeks.

“We have big dreams of making 

a run here and continuing to jump 
the standings in the Big Ten,” 
Marody said. “We need those guys 
to continue to step up like that.”

his elevated confidence, Warren is 
determined that link doesn’t break 
anytime soon.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ ready for Nebraska

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team dodged a bullet Tuesday.

The 
Wolverines 
took 

Maryland’s best shot, stumbled to 
the brink of taking a heartbreaking 
loss but clumsily rebounded for an 
ugly win.

It was Michigan’s first game as a 

ranked team in the 2017-18 season, 
and the results weren’t all that 
convincing. It struggled to contain 
Terrapins guard Anthony Cowan 
Jr., struggled to make layups at 
times and struggled to put its foot 
on the opponent’s throat when the 
occasion called for it.

Still, the bullet was dodged.
Thursday, as is the nature of the 

Big Ten schedule, the Wolverines 
will face another potential bullet — 
this time in the form of Nebraska.

The 
Cornhuskers 
are 
a 

confusing team. Though they’ve 
lost to Central Florida and have 
been blown out by St. John’s, 
they also barely lost to then-No. 
13 Kansas and beat then-No. 14 
Minnesota on the road. Not to 
mention, coach Tim Miles’ squad 
has won six of its last eight games.

It’s 
a 
bit 
surprising 
that 

Nebraska has found any success at 
all this season. After four players 
transferred from the program last 
season, Miles had to pick up the 
pieces this offseason and try to 
fit the team back together. He got 
that in the form of some incoming 
transfers.

James Palmer Jr., transferred 

from Miami after the 2015-16 
season, while Isaac Copeland 
came 
from 
Georgetown. 
All 

they’ve done so far is become the 
Cornhuskers’ two leading scorers, 
averaging 15.7 and 12.3 points per 
game, respectively.

Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein sees versatility in the 
Cornhuskers, and he compared 
the impact of Palmer to that of 
redshirt sophomore guard Charles 
Matthews.

“All 
their 
guys, 
I 
mean, 

Copeland’s been coming off the 
bench, he’s shooting, and Palmer, 
coming from Miami, he’s Charles 
Matthews, is who he is.” Beilein 
said. “He can pass the ball, he 
shoots the ball, he’s long, he’s 

athletic. He’s Charles Matthews.”

Even beyond Palmer’s abilities, 

Nebraska plays a similar style to 
the Wolverines. There are times 
when the Cornhuskers won’t 
have a traditional center on the 
floor — like Michigan when junior 
forward Moritz Wagner plays.

Of course, Nebraska does not 

have Wagner. Its starting center, 
Jordy Tshimanga, averages just 
3.5 points per game and plays 
just over 15 minutes per game. 
After him, the next tallest player 
is 6-foot-9. It’s a rarity that the 
Wolverines have a size advantage 
of any kind, but Thursday that may 
be the case.

“The way they play, with 

essentially five guards at some 
times, is a challenge,” said fifth-
year senior Duncan Robinson. 
“But hopefully we’ll be ready for 
the challenge.”

Against Maryland, Michigan 

showed some versatility of its 
own. At one point late in the game, 
Beilein took out sophomore point 
guard Zavier Simpson in favor of 
freshman guard Jordan Poole. 
The Wolverines didn’t have a 
traditional point guard on the 
floor, but Beilein emphasized that 
he wants to get Poole — a dynamic 
scorer — on the court as often as 
possible.

“We’re going to try to do 

everything we can to get Jordan 
more 
minutes,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“Especially if (Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman) is clicking and 
not in foul trouble, defensively he’s 
very good. Charles gives us a great 
slasher, a shooter, a playmaker. We 
don’t want him just sharing times 
at one position, so we’ve been 
trying to do that.”

No matter who the Wolveirnes 

throw out on the floor, they’ll have 
to contend with the atmosphere 
in Lincoln. Of course, Michigan 
has played in tough environments 
already this season, winning in 
East Lansing less than a week 
ago, but Nebraska’s home court is 
enough of a test for Beilein to call 
it one of the best environments in 
the Big Ten.

“Unbelievable place to play, I 

mean they pack it,” Robinson said. 
“We’ve had some success down 
there recently, but obviously, we’re 
gonna have to bring it tomorrow.”

Design by Casey Tin


would be the librarian for comics 
here at the University, Carter’s 
username suits him quite nicely — 
little did he know he would be saving 
the world of comics for students.
As comics make an appearance 
in the library and foreign language 
courses, they’re also beginning 
to make their way into teaching 
styles and other areas of academia. 
Gina Brandolino, lecturer in the 
Sweetland Center for Writing and 
the Department of English, and 
Ali Shapiro, lecturer in Sweetland, 
the School of Art & Design and 
the English Department Writing 
Program, are setting the stage for 
the future of comics in academia.
To truly understand their love 
and admiration for comics, Shapiro 
sent me a self-designed graphic, 
which resembles both her and 
Brandolino at their individual desks, 
reading comics and continuously 
passing 
on 
information 
and 
commentary about them. While 
both are avid comic book readers, 
the two have the opportunity to 
discuss and teach comics (yes, just 
comics) in a classroom setting this 
summer.
“When 
we 
learned 
about 
the opportunity to teach a class 
together, it seemed obvious that 
would be a great class and, for me, 
a good opportunity to think more 
about pedagogy and comics with 
somebody really useful to do that 
with,” Brandolino wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily.
In the past, Brandolino has 
taught all-comic courses through 
the English Department, with 
themes relating to fame and infamy, 
and topics revolving around place.
“Teaching comics is pretty far 
outside my wheelhouse. I was 
trained as a medievalist, so I relied 
on the help of a good number of 
people to make the class work,” 
Brandolino said.
Luckily, alongside Brandolino is 
Shapiro, someone who draws her 
own comics and teaches in LSA and 
the School of Art & Design.
“I started drawing comic strips 
for my high school paper and 
eventually became the comics 
editor. My college application essay 
was a three-page comic essay,” 
Shapiro wrote. Between them and 
their dabbles in comics, the two are 
sure to bring an array of knowledge 
and enthusiasm to the course.
Comics can be action-packed, 
entertaining 
and 
effulgent 
— 
adjectives that a comics neophyte 
like myself would relate to something 
along the lines of superheroes — but 

Brandolino and Shapiro brought 
my attention to comics that were 
down-to-earth and realistic. Many 
of these pieces, though in the genres 
of magical realism, mystery, fiction, 
fantasy and even horror, allude to 
everyday challenges that people 
face in reality.
Brandolino’s favorite comic, “My 
Favorite Thing Is Monsters” by 
Emil Ferris, tells the story of Karen, 
a little girl growing up in 1960s 
Chicago.
“She has a hard time fitting in at 
school and, as a way to cope with 
that and some other hard things 
going on in her life, pretends she is a 
werewolf,” she wrote.
Shapiro added that she has 
“also really been enjoying Michael 
DeForge, particularly his book 
‘Big Kids,’ which is just so weird 
and imaginative (spoiler alert: 
people turn into trees).” Despite the 
imaginary and fantastical elements 
in the stories, they propose real 
characters who encounter situations 
with 
coming-of-age, 
murder, 
Holocaust survivors and complex 
relationships. We’re not just talking 
about cute Snoopy comics anymore.
With this in mind, Brandolino 
and 
Shapiro 
described 
their 
intentions for their summer comic 

course and their hopes for students 
to read comics in a new light. A 
portion of their class description 
proposes the analysis of reading 
comics through a social justice lens:
“Comics 
also 
raise 
great 
questions about justice, pushing 
us to redefine ‘good guys’ and 
‘bad guys,’ explore marginalized 
perspectives and interrogate our 
expectations of what people, places 
and things ‘should’ look like. Indeed, 
comics are just as worthy of careful 
attention and analysis as are the 
literary ‘classics’ we typically think 
of as appropriate reading for school.” 
While we can read comics as 
a form of entertainment or solely 
as fictional stories, they exist 
to serve a greater purpose. As 
Dave Carter mentioned to me, 
Joe Sacco’s “Palestine” and John 
Lewis’s “March: Book 1,” are both 
nonfiction accounts of activism 
and calls to social justice. And yes, 
they’re graphic novels.
We have comics that are fun, we 
have comics that are serious; we 
have comics that are magical and 
comics that are realistic. We have 
comics about kids getting bit by 
radioactive spiders (“The Amazing 
Spider-Man”) and comics reflecting 
on coming-of-age and sexuality 
(“Fun Home”). My only question is: 
Where does it all, this art form and 
this educational platform, go from 
here?
“For sure, comics are starting 
to assert themselves as a serious 
art form in general, and that, I 
suspect, will continue to happen. I 
see comics playing an increasingly 
greater role in college classrooms 
in the future,” Brandolino wrote. 
“Comics are for me, in most senses, 
just like any other kind of text — 
they tell stories that demand close 
and careful attention, that you get 
more out of the more time you spend 
looking deeply into them. I don’t 
treat a comic less seriously than a 
short story, for instance. I think it 
deserves the same level of serious 
consideration as any story.”
Though we see how comics are 
breaking boundaries and are now 
being considered pieces of literature, 
we can’t forget how comics can 
benefit us as readers, students and 
educators.
Carter, Brandolino and Shapiro 
all touched on the idea that reading 
a comic or a graphic novel is still 
different than reading most texts. 
They’re not all necessarily linear, 
where we can read line by line 
and left to right like we would 
with any typical piece of English 
literature. You’re hit all at once 
with scenes, images, descriptions 
and dialogue — details that need to 
be noticed in order to comprehend 
and appreciate that of a comic or 
graphic novel. In some way, graphic 
novels put us all on a similar scale 
of reading pace, where we take our 
time, live in the present of each 
panel and use our brains to read 
literature in a way with which we 
aren’t familiar.
“They’ve (comics) still got a 
rich history of telling stories that 
might otherwise be marginalized, 
or telling stories in weird ways,” 
Shapiro explained. “I think it 
matters now, more than ever, that 
those stories are heard, read, seen, 
drawn.”
I think about my bookshelf at 
home, where “Welcome to the 
Jungle” is probably sitting among 
the dust of all my other pre-college 
texts. It sits between famous works 
like 
“Slaughterhouse-Five” 
and 
“The Shining.” I only ever thought 
of Harry Dresden, the fantastic 
wizard detective character, as 
another figure that young, comic-
reading boys would aspire to be. 
Man, was I wrong.
Nonetheless, 
I 
realize 
now 
that stories like “Welcome to the 
Jungle” are no different than if 
my dad gave me a book from the 
“Harry Potter” or the “Percy 
Jackson” series. Their characters, 
their downfalls and their lessons 
all derive from a similar place: They 
all know how to tell a good story. 
I never thought that something 
like Butcher’s graphic novel could 
actually help me learn more about 
literature, 
colloquial 
language, 
design and formatting, storytelling 
and so much more.
As the future of art in academia 
evolves, similar to how we are now 
analyzing rap songs and children’s 
television shows, I see the place that 
comics and graphic novels have 
in educational settings. I can only 
hope that my kids grow up reading 
graphic novels in school and learn 
to value their importance, which is 
something I unfortunately missed 
out on growing up.
To fill my regret and to pursue 
my new interest in graphic novels, 
I went to the University’s library 
search engine, Mirlyn, and typed 
in “Welcome to the Jungle.” I think 
it’s time to give it another read.

Thinking outside the panel: A look 
at comics in the classroom & beyond

B-SIDE LEAD

When I was younger, my dad gave 
me the graphic novel “Welcome 
to the Jungle,” the prequel to Jim 
Butcher’s novel series “The Dresden 
Files.”
“It’s about a detective who’s also 
a wizard,” my dad told me. “I think 
you’ll like it.” Sure, I liked science 
fiction and mystery, I read the work 
of authors like Kurt Vonnegut, 
Alice Sebold and Stephen King. But 
those books consisted of thousands 
of words and dragged along for 
hundreds of pages. No images or 
drawings or graphics. “Welcome 
to the Jungle” would be my first 
graphic novel, so I wasn’t quite sure 
what to think.
Flash forward to this past Friday 
when Dave Carter — video games 
archivist, comics librarian and 
reference services coordinator at the 
University of Michigan’s Duderstadt 
Center on North Campus — asked 
me: “So are you much of a comics 
person?” I was nervous to say no. 
I enjoyed the idea of comics as an 
artistic platform and as a method 
of storytelling, but I never read 
any except for the one my dad gave 
me. But there I was, interviewing a 
comics aficionado and the man who 
runs the comics collection, and I 
was giving him a blank stare.
“My dad’s really into them,” I 
told him. “What’s the one about 
the detective but he’s a wizard?” 
He politely told me he hasn’t heard 
of it, so I was back to square one: 
naïveté about comics and little to 
no connection with them. I soon 
realized 
those 
notions 
would 
quickly change.
About 13 years ago, the University 
opened a collection devoted to 
comics and graphic novels, mainly 
for Art & Design students and 
anyone else who was interested. 
Now with around 10,000 graphic 

novels and 700 to 800 mini-comics 
(self-published, 
“grassroots”-type 
comics), the collection has made 
a hefty dent in the University’s 
libraries and provides a service for a 
variety of students.
Carter 
is 
responsible 
for 
selecting the comics that go into the 
collection, mainly ordering from 
Vault of Midnight, a comic shop 
right here in Ann Arbor. Regardless 
of the new comics Carter orders, 
he’s also in charge of selecting 
comics from donations.
I walked into Carter’s office 
when suddenly, I was hit with 
piles – loaded piles – of donated 
comics and graphic novels. But it’s 
not that people get sick of them 
or that they’re outdated – like any 
good story, you pass it on, and 
that’s what the donations do for the 
future students who will access the 
collection.
“I’m building a collection for the 
person who’s going to be researching 
comics 20, 50, 100 years from now,” 
Carter said. “Today’s trash culture is 
tomorrow’s high culture.”
Gathering comics in today’s age, 
even the less popular ones, will be 
relevant for someone in the near 
future. Comics are on the rise, and 
therefore the next generation of 
comic book readers need a collection 
worthy of their time.
Carter went on to explain his 
process in choosing which comics 
go into the collection. His goal is to 
“identify key comics from around 
the world,” where he finds a wide 
variety in the world of comics. He 
tackles projects where he chooses 
to focus on comics and comic series 
from certain regions of the world, 
ranging from Eastern Europe, Latin 
America, Africa and soon South 
Asia. And before Friday, I only knew 
of “Superman,” “Peanuts” and 
anime, let alone comics originating 
from all around the world.
In the mindset of diversifying 
the collection, Carter also looks at 

marginalized authors and stories. 
Instead of solely stories about 
white, male superheroes, comics 
about magical realism or realistic 
fiction are chosen. He will choose 
comics that reach out to different 
audiences, like children, college 
students and adults. Additionally, 
female authors, authors of color 
and queer-identifying authors are 
factors in the collection selection.
Another essential part of Carter’s 

job is going around to different 
classes and telling students and 
professors 
about 
the 
comics 
section. Communication Studies 
and English are two courses Carter 
speaks to because they discuss 
how comics are both a form of 
storytelling and entertainment. But 
the classes finding it most useful 
are foreign language courses like 
German, French and Italian.
Instead of reading novels with 
texts, students are reading graphic 
novels in these classes. Carter 
described how graphic novels give 
the reader “visual clues” that allow 
one to better understand phrases or 

words because of their coinciding 
images. These graphic novels have 
a “big use of colloquial language,” 
he added, which helps students 
further their comprehension of the 
language.
During the interview, Carter 
showed me pieces that were not 
displayed in the public collection but 
instead were stored privately due to 
older, more fragile binding or ones 
that are oversized.
He pulled out a book that had 
to be 3x3 feet, opening it gently to 
show me the fluorescent drawings 
of the famous comic “Little Nemo” 
by Winsor McCay. Dating all the 
way back as early as 1905, the 
story of Little Nemo dreams these 
extraordinary dreams, only to 
awaken by the end of the strip. 
Carter explained to me how comics 
used to be full-page spreads in these 
old-fashioned newspapers, not the 
tiny, two to three block comics we 
get in print now.
There was something about 
it: its vibrancy, its imagery, its 
eye-catching size, its age. I was 
absorbed into the strokes of “Little 
Nemo.” Though anyone could pick 
up a paper and be entertained by 
McCay’s character, it hit me how 
much comics have evolved from 
newspapers to web-forms and now 
to full-length pieces of literature. 
Comics have made and continue to 
make a distinct impact on society, 
both educationally and socially.
Carter’s phone sat on the table 
during the interview. His phone 
case has the image of the Superman 
“S,” big and bold in red and blue. 
In that moment, the connection 
occurred to me: His email is 
superman@umich.edu.
“I chose that (username) back 
in 1989 when I was a freshman 
in Engineering,” he said. They 
told him to “pick something you’ll 
remember.”
“So I picked ‘Superman’ as my 
ID,” Carter said. Not knowing he

comics can benefit 

us as readers,

Local Ann Arbor cartoonist 
Bruce 
Worden 
describes 
his 
comics as “a blend of humor and 
music.” In his series “Woodstalk,” 
Worden tells the tale of the long 
forgotten 
zombie 
apocalypse 
that plagues the similarly named 
popular music festival in the 
1960s. Rock Society Magazine said 
of Worden’s comic: “Good music-
based comics are something of 
a rarity, but Woodstalk is one of 
those which is just surreal and 
irreverent enough to break that 
mold.”
In an email interview with The 
Daily, Worden explains how music 
plays a role in his work, his love of 
a certain lasagna-loving, Monday-
hating feline and what our grocery 
lists say about us.
The Michigan Daily: How did 
you get into making comics? 
Who made you want to be a 
cartoonist?
Bruce Worden: I fell in love 
with “Garfield” in elementary 
school and “Far Side” in middle 

school. I’m not a graphic novelist 
by nature, I’m much more of a 
comic strip kid. But I like to think 
that helps keep my writing tight 
and punchy if I’m doing a longer 
story.
TMD: How does music play a 
role in your work?
BW: Musicians are like real-life 
superheroes to me, so they’re often 
the first spark of my stories. Music 
is also where my geekiness resides. 
It’s a well I’m comfortable drawing 
from, and hopefully, I can make 
cartoons interesting enough for 
others if I make them interesting 
enough for me.
TMD: What are you into 
right now? What is going on in 
the comics scene right now that 
is really cool?
BW: I mostly like coming-of-age 
stories, things like “Scott Pilgrim” 
(O’Malley) or “This One Summer” 
(Tamaki/Tamaki). So along those 
lines, I feel like young women 
cartoonists are creating the best 
stuff out there right now, beautiful 
and full of feeling. All of Jess Fink’s 
work, Taneka Stotts, Kate Leth, 
Benji Nate. Kate Beaton can do 
no wrong in my mind. That said, 

I’ve been devouring John Allison’s 
“Bad Machinery” books lately. I 
didn’t think anything could make 
me wish I was in middle school 
again, but there you go!
TMD: I stumbled across 
this awesome project you are 
working on called Shoppers 
Unknown. Can you tell me a 
little more about that? What 
was your inspiration?
BW: I’ve been collecting other 
people’s lost/dropped shopping 
lists for years, never quite knowing 
what I was going to do with them. 
The more I looked through them, 
though, the more I realized I was 
mostly interested in what they 
hinted about the people who wrote 
them. I started imagining who 
they were, and eventually decided 
it would be fun to draw my ideas 
of them. Like, if the list implies a 
person, then the drawing of the 
person implies a whole backstory. 
I love it.
I took the end of 2017 off from 
Shoppers Unknown to focus on my 
book “Woodstalk” (Kickstarter 
starting Feb. 5) but I’m about to 
start back in on it! I’ve got SO 
many shopping lists yet to do!

BECKY PORTMAN
Senior Arts Editor

“Cartooning for me is a 
language that is not solely 
visual — the words and the 
images don’t stand alone … 
they come together to form 
something else.”
It is early evening as I sit 
in the studio of artist Phoebe 
Gloeckner, 
an 
associate 
professor in the Stamps School 
of Art & Design. Though 
best known for her semi-
autobiographical 
graphic 
novel “Diary of a Teenage 
Girl,” Gloeckner has worked 
as 
a 
medical 
illustrator, 
published 
two 
full-length 

graphic 
novels 
and 
seen 
countless comics printed in 
journals and magazines. She 
is fascinating and passionate, 
and The Michigan Daily had 
the pleasure to chat with 
Gloeckner and gain insight 
into the world of comics and 
cartooning.
Gloeckner’s attic studio is 
large and eclectic; the ceilings 
are high and something is 
occupying every nook and 
cranny of the space. In the 
center of the room the floor 
is made up of a sandy-dirt 
mixture. Each wall is uniquely 
decorated — no section is left 
bare. One wall is hidden by 
books while another boasts 

shelves 
lined 
with 
cloth 
dolls. There’s a storage room 
containing every art supply 
imaginable, and a tall ladder in 
the sandy center leads to a loft 
occupied by what appears to be 
miniature film sets.
I sit on a low chair, facing 
Phoebe’s desk and the stool 
on which she is perched. 
We’re 
discussing 
whether 
or not autobiography works 
better as a graphic novel 
than a traditional novel. It’s a 
contested subject.
On 
one 
hand, 
Phoebe 
argues that stories involving 
heavier, real topics work well 
as graphic novels because “the 
more specific something is, 

the more relatable it becomes. 
I think in a sense it’s easier to 
do that with comics because 
instead 
of 
describing 
the 
wallpaper, 
you’re 
drawing 
the wallpaper, it’s there.” The 
concept that graphic novels 
allow readers to visualize their 
characters exactly the way the 
author sees them, however, is a 
double-edged sword.
When asked if presenting 
readers 
with 
one 
specific 
image made them focus more 
on the content and less on 
the 
imagination, 
Phoebe 
responded with questions of 
her own.
“When you read ‘Maus,’ 
do you just accept the person 
looks like a mouse? Or someone 
is cartoony with simplified 
features? This too gives you 
room to interpret what they 
look like in real life.”
Ultimately, the conclusion 
was that there is no conclusion. 
After 
all, 
cartooning 
isn’t 
always black and white. As 
Gloeckner pointed out later in 
the evening, when showing the 
comics in consideration for the 
2018 edition of “Best American 
Comics,” 
an 
anthology 
for 
which she is the year’s guest 
editor, the style of a comic is 
specific to each cartoonist. 
Some are vibrantly colored 
and look hand-painted; others 
are 
grey-scale 
and 
closely 
resemble doodles. The variety 
of both subject and style in the 
comics was astonishing. This 
variety is perhaps why she is so 
drawn to the form.
Gloeckner’s fascination with 
comics was born when she 
was living in San Francisco 
and sneak-reading the “head 
comics” her hippie mother and 
stepfather had (unsuccessfully) 
hidden from the impressionable 
eyes of 12-year old Phoebe. 
And 
impressionable 
these 
comics were. The nature of 
underground “head comics” 
— wild and inappropriate — 
taught Gloeckner that comics 
“don’t have to be limited to 
superheroes or cute dogs.” It 
was this early education which 
taught Gloeckner she could “do 
comics and they can be about 

anything (she) wants.”
The 
notion 
that 
comics 
can be about more than just 
“superheroes and dogs” is not 
a new concept. Gloeckner cited 
several contemporaries who 
used this form to tell heavy, 
often autobiographical stories 
— Art Spieglman’s “Maus,” 
Justin Green’s “Binky Brown 
Meets the Holy Virgin Mary” 
and Robert Crumb’s stories 
with his wife, Aline Kominsky-
Crumb. 
The 
category 
of 
comics which reveal universal 
truths about humans through 
personal histories is a heavily 

(and artfully) decorated one.
Reflecting 
on 
her 
own 
semi-autobiographical works, 
Gloeckner recalls why she 
was inspired to write “Diary 
of a Teenage Girl” in the first 
place: “I didn’t see that voice 
reflected in other books or 
other films and that voice 
wasn’t just mine. It could be any 
girl, or any person, perhaps.” It 
could be any person, and it was; 
Marielle Heller saw herself in 
Gloeckner’s work and adapted 
the piece first into a play and 
later a film. Though Heller’s 
motivation to make the film 
differed 
from 
Gloeckner’s 
inspiration to write the book, 
the sentiment was the same for 
both.
Nowadays, 
Gloeckner 
is 
working on another unique 
form of storytelling — one 
which may not be qualified 
as a comic at all. Her current 

project uses cloth dolls and 
elaborate, miniature film sets 
to represent the violent scenes 
of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.
Initally sent to Juarez to 
write 
stories 
for 
Amnesty 
International, 
Gloeckner 
found herself drawn back time 
and time again. It was on one 
of those trips she read a police 
blotter about the brutal rape 
and murder of a 15-year-old girl 
in Juarez. At the same time, 
Gloeckner 
was 
supporting 
herself by working as a medical 
illustrator on a project titled 
“The Joys of Sex Toys.” Both 
the murder and her work as a 
medical illustrator involved, 
coincidentally, butt plugs.
“It got all my wires crossed 
and I had difficulty drawing 
either thing,” recalls Gloeckner. 
Compelled to further explore 
the violent story but unsure 
how, 
Gloeckner 
came 
up 
with a unique alternative to 
cartooning.
“I’ll use dolls. I’ll kill them 
and then the next day I’ll wipe 
the blood off, and they’ll be 
alive again,” she said.
New challenges accompanied 
this undertaking. “I had to 
learn to use power tools and 
make things, and I didn’t know 
how to do any of those things 
before.” 
She 
experimented 
with stop-motion and learned 
to 
understand 
and 
speak 
Spanish.
Though still in the process 
of finishing the story, her piece 
has already affected change. 
When it is done, a valuable, 
necessary story will get the 
attention it deserves.
Regardless of the project — 
illustrating sex toys, teaching 
digital painting, creating a 
graphic 
novel, 
researching 
a foreign community — a 
genuine passion is ever-present 
in Gloeckner’s work. It’s clear 
that she is still fascinated by 
what hooked her in the first 
place: That there are stories 
to be told and pictures to 
be created, and they can be 
whatever. It doesn’t have to 
be superheroes and dogs — 
but it could be. With Phoebe 
Gloeckner, art can be anything.

‘Your Black Friend’ takes 
on millenial woke racism

You could easily mistake 
Ben Passmore’s “Your Black 
Friend” for a light read; after 
all, it is only 11 pages long. 
However, 
through 
skilled 
artistry and strong language, 
the mini-comic is as poignant 
and relevant as it is visually 
pleasing. Its cover draws you in, 
boasting 
playful 
pastels 
and 
bouncy 
bubble 
letters, 
looking 
more 
like 
a 
middle schooler’s 
doodle 
than 
an 
open 
letter 
about racism and 
Black alienation in America. 
Its 
characters 
are 
spot-on 
caricatures of people you have 
known or seen or been, depicted 
with a balance of humor and 
criticism.
“Your Black Friend” is a 
brief yet intensely powerful 
testament 
to 
what 
racism 
looks 
like 
among 
“woke” 
millennials. In word and image, 
Passmore creates a work that 
is 
simultaneously 
personal 
and collective, encompassing 
his own experiences while 
capturing the experiences of 
others. 
Written 
entirely 
in 
the second person, Passmore 
actively engages in a critical 

and much-needed conversation 
about race in today’s America. 
The 
comic 
involves 
the 
reader in an unconventional 
way, pointing to them as it 
begs and pleads that you, 
and only you, recognize the 
pervasiveness of racism in our 
culture. Passmore’s narrator 
grapples between two poles 
of racialization, one being not 
Black enough for his Black 
friends and the other being 
too Black for his 
white 
friends. 
He lives in racial 
limbo, where his 
own 
existence 
is measured and 
metered by his 
peers rather than 
himself.
Passmore uses a distinct color 
palette of soothing pastels of 
blue, purple and pink. Even the 
most troubling and gruesome 
of scenes is inked with bright 
and whimsical hues, washing 
over the darkness and dread 
of the comic’s content with a 
paintbrush soaked in millennial 
pink. Just as the comic washes 
over the serious with a façade of 
brightness, the façade of woke-
ness 
masks 
the 
sometimes 
unintentional 
but 
inherent 
racism that lies beneath. 
“Your Black Friend” attacks 
the millennial post-racial myth 
head-on with tact and humor. 
Like Jordan Peele’s (“Key and 

Peele”) terrifyingly relevant 
and 
award-winning 
social 
thriller “Get Out,” Passmore’s 
comic 
confronts 
the 
self-
serving nature of white guilt, 
turning alliance into a selfish 
and preoccupied excuse for 
sympathy. Passmore addresses 
the performance of linguistic 
“blackface” among his white 
friends. He explores the desire 
to try on “Blackness” like 
a costume, a hipster in full 
minstrel guise in a desperate 
attempt 
to 
reconcile 
white 
privilege in a country built on 
racism. Passmore manages to 
capture a similar feeling of 
alienation and fear without 
directly evoking the horror 
tone of Peele’s masterpiece. 
Passmore 
effectively 
uses the comics medium to 
communicate his message and 
personal experiences. He fills 
the small comic to the brim 
with jarring colors, expertly 
formatting 
the 
pages 
with 
text and images that inform 
and complement one another. 
Passmore’s use of arrows and 
comments 
throughout 
make 
the comic feel more organic, 
as if the author is allowing a 
snapshot into his own diary. 
From run-ins with the cops to 
eating a po-boy at a coffee shop, 
Passmore walks the reader 
through the 21st-century Black 
experience in a 21st-century 
white world.

Marvel movies subvert 
the superhero narrative

The Marvel movie franchise 
has a bad reputation for being 
associated with movies that are 
essentially overpriced, overdone 
blockbuster fodder. It’s imagined 
to be loved exclusively by stringy 
comic book nerds and those of 
“low-brow culture.” With the 
tedium of each new Marvel 
movie hitting the big screen like 
clockwork, it’s easy for people to 
disregard the franchise with a 
cavalier “Eh, those movies don’t 
really appeal to me.” But what 
most people fail to realize is that 
the 
Marvel 
movie 
franchise, 
dubbed the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe, is a highly complex, 
endlessly fascinating, extremely 
impressive 
and 
revolutionary 
feat of moviemaking that defies 
cinematic structure and explores 
deeply resonant societal themes.
While 
superhero 
films, 
or 
adaptations 
of 
comic 
book 
characters, have been around since 
the 1930s, the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe, or MCU, is radically 
different than anything that has 
come before in film. Structurally, 
the MCU is designed as a web with 
an intricate interweaving of origin 
stories, sequels and ensemble 
films that introduce and feature 
different players throughout the 
expansive network of films. This 
unorthodox structure gives the 
franchise a puzzle-finding feel 
that challenges viewers to search 
for and spot different heroes in 
different movies. Like pieces on a 
larger gameboard, the MCU works 
as a massive universe in which the 
characters exist, with each movie 
exploring a different part of that 
universe. While all this seems 
chaotic and slippery, the franchise 
is actually meticulously planned. 
The MCU timeline is easily 
accessible online, where the details 
for a four-phase cinematic opera 
are laid out. The sheer breadth of 
planning — starting with “Iron 
Man” in 2008 and continuing with 
untitled films set to release as late 
as 2028 — demonstrates franchise 
construction on a completely new 
scale. And while characters and 
emotional nuance can easily get 
lost in the haze of an entity that 
large, the MCU stays grounded 
with 
clear 
development 
and 
emotional arcs.
What makes Marvel so brilliant 
is that in the midst of juggling a 
massive ensemble of different 
characters, 
backstories 
and 
motivations, the franchise is able 
to craft distinct personalities for 
each character and weave them 
all together. Instead of being one-
dimensional, each hero is shaded 
with nuance. Iron Man isn’t just 
cocky and impulsive but is rather 
a detail-obsessed genius with a 
confused moral compass whose 
narcissism is bred from daddy 
issues. In its ensemble films, 
sharply written dialogue works to 
seamlessly blend each character’s 
personality so that they both stand 
out and blend in. 
The MCU is an unprecedented 
beast of a movie franchise, with 
structural and story elements that 
keep viewers locked in, waiting 
for the next piece of the puzzle. 
While the MCU is a revolutionary 
media entity among franchises in 
general, it’s also remarkable within 
the genre of superhero narratives. 

The MCU is not merely a large 
collection of traditional hero vs. 
villain, good vs. evil storylines. 
Marvel examines and challenges 
heroism, morality and fantasy in 
ways that are unparalleled in texts 
of the superhero genre.
Superhero narratives, rooted in 
comic books, are defined by a few 
classic tropes. Of course, there 
is the hero, a morally righteous 
protagonist committed to the 
fight against an equally insidious 
villain. There is a clear binary 
between good and evil, and 
these moralities are uncontested. 
Superhero movies are heavily 
laden with action, dynamic fight 
scenes, big explosions and chaos 
in the name of justice. They exist 
clearly in the realm of fantasy: The 
hero possesses a heightened ability 
that sets him or her apart from the 
masses and can wield this power 
freely. These tropes are integral 
to the superhero narrative, and 
they serve to create distance from 
reality. Superhero films generally 
reflect the thematic tradition of 
comic books, mirroring the moral 
binaries of comic book heroes.
Destruction plays an interesting 
and integral role in superhero 
films. While it may seem obvious 
to think about, every hero fight 
inevitably involves destruction. 
Superhero films in the mid-2000s 
used relatively old-school effects 

to blow up a building or a city 
block, adding visually compelling 
elements to a climactic fight 
scene. In “Batman Begins” (2005), 
Batman 
destroys 
a 
monorail 
line while the train drives into a 
parking structure and explodes. 
In “The Dark Knight” (2008), the 
Joker detonates a string of bombs 
that blow up an entire hospital. 
Destruction is understood as a 
natural and entertaining part 
of the genre that heightens the 
actions and suspense of the scene.
Advancements in CGI special 
effects allowed for more complex 
and dynamic fight scenes moving 
into the 2010s. Bigger explosions 
and more precise detail meant new 
possibilities for mass destruction 
on a completely different scale. 
Magneto in “X-Men: Days of 
Future Past” (2014) lifts an entire 
baseball stadium and floats it 
around before sending it crashing 
into the cityscape below. In 
“X-Men Apocalypse” (2016), the 
X-Men raze the entire city of Cairo 
to the ground, leaving it completely 
decimated. What’s interesting is 
that in every superhero film there 
are no discussions about the loss of 

life, infrastructural consequences 
or acknowledgment of any kind of 
damage and chaos following the 
battle. And with contemporary 
superhero movies playing out on 
an international or intergalactic 
scale, the lack of acknowledgment 
of destruction becomes more 
apparent and more fantastical.
Here is where the Avengers 
franchise 
completely 
revolutionizes 
the 
superhero 
genre. With its meticulous buildup 
of films and phases, Marvel 
initially reflects the tropes of 
its genre, only to then deliver a 
climactic movie that challenges 
thematic taboos routinely left out 
of the narrative. There are three 
pivotal battles in the franchise 
that all involve massive amounts 
of destruction: in “The Avengers” 
(2012), the team fights Loki and 
his alien-insect army, destroying 
large chunks of Manhattan in the 
process; In “Captain America: 
The 
Winter 
Soldier” 
(2014), 
Captain America and Falcon send 
government 
airships 
crashing 
into Washington D.C.; and in “The 
Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015), 
the Avengers fight Ultron while he 
lifts the entire city of Sokovia off 
the ground. These three films in 
the Avengers narrative arc involve 
crucial moments of character 
development, 
shifting 
team 
dynamics, introduction of new 
characters and the evolution of 
villains. But in “Captain America: 
Civil War” (2016), these moments 
become the fulcrum upon which 
the progression of the narrative 
balances.
“Captain America: Civil War” 
is responsible for bursting the 
bubble of fantasy in the superhero 
narrative. At the start of the movie, 
Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., 
“The Judge”) is confronted by a 
grieving mother whose son died 
in the battle at Sokovia. In this 
moment, for the first time, a hero is 
faced with the real and detrimental 
consequences 
of 
his 
actions 
and the unintended but severe 
consequences on human lives from 
unrestrained 
destruction. 
The 
tension between heroic action and 
unheroic consequence becomes 
the focus of the movie, and 
Stark’s enormous guilt drives his 
motivations for the rest of the film. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Soon after Stark’s crushing 
epiphany, 
the 
Avengers 
meet 
with Secretary of State Thaddeus 
Ross (William Hurt, “Goliath”). 
Ross projects a video summary 
of the Avengers’ major battles but 
without the polished and self-
indulgent perspective of their 
original play. Imagery of buildings 
exploding, cars crashing, people 
screaming and errant gunfire turn 
previously exciting action scenes 
into terrifying and traumatic 
warzones. Watching the clips, 
the Avengers all wear faces of 
realization and shame. This scene 
is crucial for so many reasons; It 
shows a direct interaction between 
heroes and government agencies 
and introduces a new perspective 
on the Avengers, what it means to 
be a hero and the consequences of 
unrestrained power.
Ross makes clear that up until 
now, the Avengers have “operated 
with unlimited power and no 
supervision.” He exchanges the 
word hero with the word vigilante, 
asking “what would you call a 
group of U.S.-based, enhanced 
individuals who routinely ignore 
sovereign borders and inflict their 

SYDNEY COHEN
Daily Arts Writer

will wherever they choose, and 
who frankly seem unconcerned 
about what they leave behind?” 
In an effort to curb the power of 
the Avengers, Ross introduces the 
Sokovia Accords, a contract that if 
signed would place the Avengers 
under United Nations jurisdiction. 
In order to impose a system of 
accountability and place limits on 
previously 
unrestricted 
power, 
a U.N. panel would have control 
over the team, deploying them 
when the panel deems it necessary. 
The document essentially strips 
the Avengers of their agency, but 
also curbs potential unforeseen 
consequences.
The significance of this moment, 
why it’s brilliant and unparalleled, 
cannot be understated. Here we 
see the first major integration of 
world powers in a fantasy realm, 
where the government has actual, 
sizable influence. For the first time 
in the superhero genre, we see an 
effort to impose accountability 
on superheroes who previously 
wielded power without restraint, 
or even the concept of restraint. 
This move has only ever been seen 
once before, in “The Incredibles” 
(2004), when injured civilians took 
superheroes to court, and a national 
law forced them into hiding. This 
is really the first instance of the 
powers of ordinary society curbing 
the powers of the extraordinary. 
But “The Incredibles” fails to 
take the tension between fantasy 
and reality further and ends up 
mostly concerned with the self-
actualization of heroes.
The question of whether or not to 
sign the Sokovia Accords launches 
the Avengers into the main 
conflict of “Civil War” — a debate 
of accountability vs. free will. 

Tony Stark urges the team to sign 
because he sees unaccountability 
as the most dangerous threat to 
the Avengers and the world, and 
argues they can’t be allowed to 
continue without restrains or 
limits. Captain America, on the 
other hand, rejects the Accords, 
arguing that the contract places a 
limit on free will, and emphasizes 
his belief in everyone’s right to act 
as a free agent.
With this debate, the MCU 
tackles the morality of heroism 

and explores the philosophies of 
its heroes. Marvel demonstrates 
that it is extremely self-aware of 
the tropes of its genre, effectively 
subverting them by questioning 
and challenging what it means to 
be a superhero. Marvel complicates 
the binary between good and 
evil by spotlighting death and 
destruction at the hands of those 
who are considered heroes. Marvel 
also introduces the influence of 
real-world consequences on the 
actions and motivations of its 
heroes. Because these elements 
have never been approached in 
this way or to this magnitude in 
any superhero film before, Marvel 

is essentially constructing a new 
subgenre 
of 
superhero 
films: 
one that is preoccupied with the 
convergence of the real and the 
fantastical. The universal model 
of the franchise allows much more 
room for characters to interact and 
develop, creating a deeper level of 
familiarity between the characters 
and their world that makes the 
philosophical questions of “Civil 
War” possible, meaningful and 
believable.
There is also room for a deeper 
analytical interpretation of “Civil 
War” and the themes of the MCU. 
Subverting notions of heroism and 
moral absolutism is fascinating in 
the context of the long tradition 
of comic book heroes. But the 
debate 
between 
accountability 
and free will extends to more 
prevalent ideas in society today. 
The plot of “Civil War” can be 
read as an allegory for the debate 
between government surveillance 
and privacy and the question 
of surveillance as a necessary 
protection against terrorism or an 
infringement on civil rights. While 
it is common practice for films to 
reflect the societal themes of their 
time, Marvel is noteworthy for 
its simultaneous subversion of its 
genre.
The 
MCU 
is 
an 
elegantly 
intricate 
and completely fascinating piece 
of moviemaking that proves that 
complex narratives can exist in a 
blockbuster franchise. Marvel’s 
deconstruction 
and 
subversion 
of the superhero narrative are 
wholly unprecedented in the genre 
of comic book films and make 
watching these movies thrilling 
and deeply thought-provoking for 
both casual viewers, cinephiles 
and anyone in between.

CW
TV is a better medium for 
comic book adaptations

Despite a boom in comic book movies, the small screen is 
a better platform for the episodic nature of comic books

We live in what some might 
call “the golden age of comic 
book movies.” That is, we live in 
an age with a seemingly endless 
cycle of comic book films. Capes 
and cowls fill the big screen all 
months of the year. Next year 
alone will see the release of 
three “X-Men” movies, three 
Marvel Studios movies, a DC 
film, a Sony Pictures Spider-
Man spin-off about Venom and 
others as well. But while comic 
book movies have only recently 
begun 
to 
dominate 
movie 
theaters, TV shows based on 
comic books have been popular 
since the early ’90s. It is 
television after all, not movies, 
that is designed to be literally 
episodic in nature, watched 
week to week, episode to 
episode, for as long as possible. 
While it is comic book movies 
that currently take up most of 
the airtime surrounding comic 
adaptations, I believe that TV 
is actually the medium most 
suited to adapting comics.
Unlike movies, TV shows 
don’t have to wrap up their 
storyline at the end of an 
episode. TV shows are built 
off the idea of a cliffhanger, of 
keeping the audience coming 
back week after week. TV 
shows may have given birth 
to the phrase “monster of the 
week,” but they really got that 
idea from comic books. Shows 
like “Smallville” or “Batman: 
The Animated Series,” based 
on comic book stories about 
Superman 
and 
Batman 

respectively, feature an ongoing 
storyline while also allowing 
their heroes to fight different 
villains and foes each episode. 
Cartoons in general are a 
natural home for superheroes, 
with colorful animation fitting 
in perfectly with the artwork 
that children are familiar with 
from reading comics. Shows 
like “Teen Titans,” “Batman: 
The Brave and the Bold” or 
“Riverdale” make great use of 
their admittedly silly source 
material by playing everything 
completely straight, and letting 
the drama play out as it would 
in a comic book, with twists 
taking weeks to play out and 
ending episodes in ways that 
always 
leave 
the 
audience 
wanting more.
Another 
way 
in 
which 
TV shows based on comics 
have succeeded where films 
have failed is the idea of 
the 
“Cinematic 
Universe.” 
This term first came into 
use around the time of the 
original 
“Avengers” 
movie. 
Pioneered by Marvel Studios, a 
“Cinematic Universe” is a series 
of interconnected films that all 
take place in the same “canon,” 
allowing them to build off of or 
out of each other. While this 
idea seemed novel at the time, 
TV beat them to the punch by 
almost two decades. The DC 
Animation Universe began in 
the early ’90s with “Batman: 
The 
Animated 
Series” 
and 
“Superman: 
The 
Animated 
Series.” 
These 
two 
series 
featured 
regular 
crossovers 
and eventually expanded their 
universe to include “Justice 
League,” 
“Justice 
League: 

Unlimited,” “Batman Beyond,” 
“Teen Titans,” “Static Shock” 
and many others. While DC 
fans continue to ring their 
hands over the fate of the DC 
Universe on the big screen, 
DC has twice over had the 
best interconnected television 
universe 
on 
the 
market. 
First with the DC Animated 
Universe of the ’90s and 2000s 
and now with the so-called CW 
Arrowverse, which includes the 
shows “Arrow,” “The Flash,” 
“Supergirl” and “Legends of 
Tomorrow.”
Indeed, TV is more suited to 
the connectivity that is featured 
so 
prominently 
in 
comics. 
In TV, it’s easier to contract 
actors through the network 
to appear on a multitude of 
shows, or to animate a bunch 
of background characters from 
another 
TV 
show 
without 
having to pay anyone a cent. 
In TV, long storylines that 
play out over a half-decade or 
longer are the norm, not the 
exception. It’s hard to really 
imagine a “Riverdale” movie, 
but the series works great on 
TV, where it is just schlocky 
enough to have some kind of 
bonkers appeal. TV shows also 
don’t have to reach nearly as 
large an audience in modern 
times as movies do, and in that 
way they can be more selective 
and considerate of the kinds 
of stories they want to tell. 
While movies appear to be the 
dominant form of comic book 
adaptations, TV shows remain 
strong, and it seems likely that 
they will once again become 
the prevailing method of comic 
book adaptation in the future.

Singing in speech bubbles: 
Gorillaz’s 2-D revolution

How the animated band harnessed the untapped potential 
of virtual music-making and changed the music industry

For a whole month during the 
summer of 1969, the hottest song 
in the United States belonged 
to a comic book character. The 
chart-topper 
“Sugar 
Sugar” 
was recorded by none other 
than the Archies; that’s right, 
the cartoon band made up of 
“Archie Comics” characters like 
Veronica Lodge, Betty Cooper 
and 
the 
eponymous 
Archie 
Andrews himself. “Sugar Sugar” 
ruled the airwaves, spending 
22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 
100 and selling over a million 
copies. While not the most 
groundbreaking group at the 
time, both conceptually and 
sonically, the Archies’ animated 
bubblegum fare indirectly paved 
the way for one of the most 
imaginative and experimental 
musical acts of the 21st century: 
Gorillaz.
To 
the 
unfortunately 
uninformed, 
Gorillaz 
is 
a 

virtual band — meaning their 
lineup consists of animated 
characters rather than human 
musicians. 2-D provides the 
lead vocals, Noodle and Murdoc 
play the guitar and bass guitar 
(respectively) 
and 
Russell 
anchors the band on drums. 
However, hidden behind these 
four memorable personalities 
lies the twofold heart of the 
operation: former Blur frontman 
Damon Albarn, who spearheads 
the musical side of things, 
and comic book artist Jamie 
Hewlett, the man behind the 
now-iconic artwork and design 
of the band. The question is, 
how did Gorillaz cement itself 
as a legitimate and legendary 
band and avoid being reduced 
to nothing more than a fad like 
their animated ancestors Alvin 
and the Chipmunks and the 
California Raisins? The answer 
lies in Gorillaz’s understanding 
of the creative potential found in 
the fusion of comics and popular 
music and their unwavering 
dedication to create visuals 
as lasting as the sounds they 
accompany.
The fact that Gorillaz even 

evolved beyond a mere idea 
was as unlikely as an animated 
band earning nine Grammy 
nominations 
and 
achieving 
double-platinum 
status. 
In 
1990, Hewlett was tasked by 
Deadline Magazine, home of 
his comic strip “Tank Girl,” 
to interview Albarn. By all 
accounts, their first meeting did 
not go well. Hewlett initially 
thought of Albarn as “arsey, 
a wanker.” Despite becoming 
mild 
acquaintances 
with 
Albarn and the other members 
of 
Blur, 
including 
guitarist 
Graham Coxon, their friendship 
stagnated 
(especially 
after 
Hewlett began seeing Coxon’s 
ex-girlfriend). Despite all of this, 
however, Hewlett and Albarn 
ended up sharing a flat in 1997. 
And on one fateful day, the pair 
happened to mindlessly watch 
MTV long enough for them to 
realize something. Frustrated 
by the oversaturation of nothing 
of substance in popular music at 
the time, they decided to take 
action. If what people were 
hearing was manufactured, then 
they might as well do it properly. 
Their band was going to be fake, 
but the music sure as hell would 
be real. 
Gorillaz deserve all the praise 
they get musically for their 
attempts to deconstruct and 
synthesize different genres into 
a wholly unique and unheard 
blend of sound, but the true star 
of the show is the captivating 
visual universe Hewlett has 
designed. 
Behind 
their 
five 
studio albums lies a trove of 
music videos, documentaries, 
radio interviews, social media 
posts, 
magazines, 
animated 
shorts 
and 
one 
illustrated 
autobiography that all constitute 
a storyline more expansive and 
detailed than those of many 
comic book heroes. The skeleton 
of the Gorillaz-verse comes in the 
form of four distinct “phases,” 
each correlating with the rollout 
and promotion of their mainline 
albums (excluding 2010’s The 
Fall, which was recorded by 
Albarn on tour on an iPad and 
released as a free download). The 
four phases function as separate 
lenses, showing new angles to 
the same story and charting the 
band’s evolution over its near 
two decades of existence.
Phase 
One, 
aptly 
titled 
Celebrity Take Down, was a direct 
response to the mind-numbing 
dominance 
of 
MTV 
Albarn 
and 
Hewlett 
originally 
felt 
compelled to rebel against. The 
videos for singles like “19-2000” 
and “Rock the House” seem 
tailor-made to be broadcasted 
on the channel. Watching them 
now, they both capture perfectly 
the nostalgia for that hazy 2000s 
aesthetic. The videos for their 
self-titled debut were visually 
engaging enough to subtly slide 
lyrics parodying the shallowness 
of the music industry into the 
mind of viewer without them 
realizing. Ironically, these music 
videos were lapped up by MTV, 
tricking it into following exactly 
what 2-D croons on “19-2000”: 
“Please repeat the message / It’s 

the music that we choose.”
Phase Two and beyond were 
able to reap the benefits of 
Gorillaz receiving international 
attention 
both 
for 
their 
music and novelty of concept. 
The 
music 
videos 
became 
more 
involved, 
cinematic 
productions: “Feel Good Inc” 
and “El Mañana” both seem like 
Hewlett’s take on a Studio Ghibli 
film (with some scenes being 
directly inspired by “Castle in 
the Sky”) and “Stylo” is a foray 
into 3D CGI animation featuring 
the band members caught up in 
a Mad Max-esque car chase with 
Bruce Willis in an El Camino. 
The more attention Gorillaz got, 
the more effort was expended 
towards refining their art style 
and cultivating their expansive 
backstory. With the release 
of 2017’s Humanz, however, it 
seemed like the band became less 
concerned with telling a story 
through music videos like they 
did with Demon Days and Plastic 
Beach, and instead focused on 
showing vignettes of the four 
characters’ current lives using 
a new multimedia approach 
(the first official glimpse of 
Phase Four came from Hewlett’s 

instagram). Although Gorillaz 
has changed much throughout 
the years, their commitment to 
creating compelling art has not 
ceased.
While the story of Gorillaz 
could be easily told as a graphic 
novel or a comic book, the 
fact that it is a band and has 
that extra layer of musical 
storytelling makes it all the more 
noteworthy. Albarn and Hewlett 
are able to disappear completely 
behind the animated facade they 
have constructed, leaving fans 
fascinated by the mystery behind 
Gorillaz and its lore rather than 
fawning over the fake, produced 
image which shroud most pop 
acts. When Liam Gallagher (the 
lead singer of Oasis and rival 
to Albarn during the height of 
Britpop) once derided Gorillaz 
as a “fucking kids band,” Hewlett 
thought it was the coolest thing 
ever said about them: “I want it 
to be for kids. They’re the ones 
who don’t care who’s behind it. 
They think it’s Gorillaz, they buy 
into it the way they should.” The 
fact that when you hear Albarn’s 
vocals you immediately picture 
2-D singing speaks volumes to 
everything Gorillaz is about. 
They’re a larger-than-life band 
that wasn’t even alive to begin 
with.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 
 
 
 

CupcakKe — Chicago-born 
rapper, singer, activist and 
certified deepthroat pro-
fessional — just changed 
the game for duck onesies 
everywhere with the release 
of her “Duck Duck Goose” 
music video. It’s filthy. It’s 
fun. It features multiple 
close ups of a seemingly 
never-ending stream of 
frighteningly realistic dil-
dos. The shots are simple, 
alternating between cup-
cakKe fully clothed in 
a pool or cupcakKe, not 
clothed at all, lounging in 
a bedroom. She stares us 
straight in the eye as she 
raps, aggressive and unwav-
ering. Her rhymes are per-
fect.
 This is cupcakKe in her 
prime: fur heels and rubber 
duck nipple pasties, smiling 
wide as she delivers, “Tap 

the head of the dick, duck, 
duck duck goose.”
 There’s power in this 
unabashed ownership of 
gratuitous raunch. When 
cupcakKe emerges dur-
ing the first few seconds 
of “Duck Duck Goose,” she 
doesn’t just walk in wear-
ing a mesh bodysuit, she 
struts. When she taps the 
dildo she’s holding against 
a miniature Statue of Lib-
erty, she’s not questioning 
whether or not she can 

make your dick stand up, 
she knows she can. And who 
are we to argue with that 
kind of confidence?
 “Duck Duck Goose” is sex 
positive and body positive, 
but it’s also cupcakKe just 
having the time of her life. 
She manhandles multicol-
ored sex toys with bright 
orange nails; she has no 
time for your opinion.

Question: 

What goes 
great with your 
morning coffee?

Answer: 

michigandaily.com

“I have one of those classic 

stories in that I was interested 
in making comics at a young age. 
I knew I wanted to make comics 
at 11-years-old.”

The 
fascination 
started 

early for Jerzy Drozd, now 
a 
cartoonist, 
teacher 
and 

co-organizer 
at 
Kids 
Read 

Comics 
and 

its 
Ann 
Arbor 

event, the Ann 
Arbor 
Comic 

Arts 
Festival. 

Having grown up 
in a small town 
with no comic 
store, 
Drozd 

became 
hooked 

on sharing his 
knowledge 
of 

creating 
comics 

once he started 
teaching over 10 
years ago.

“Opening 

up the process 
of 
comics 

and 
inviting 

cartoonists 
to 

come out of their 
studios 
reveals 

to the public the 
narrative 
and 

writing 
skills 

needed for comic 
writing,” 
Drozd 

said. 
“Making 

comics accessible to people has 
been very beneficial to inviting 
more people into the medium.”

Over the years that Drozd 

has been teaching, he has seen 
an increase in Ann Arbor’s 
engagement with comics.

“When I started teaching 

classes at the Ann Arbor Art 
Center about eight years ago, it 
was difficult to get the critical 
signup numbers for a class to 
run and it would be very hit or 
miss,” Drozd said. “Now, I have 
a waiting list for every class I 
teach there and I’m teaching 
more classes than ever before.”

Not only have more people 

been interested in comics, but 
the culture of comics itself is 
shifting in Ann Arbor, becoming 
more friendly and accessible. 
Drozd has noticed the downfall 
of the stereotype that comic 
stores and the comic community 
are unwelcoming to newcomers, 
finding that stores like Vault 
of Midnight in Ann Arbor are 
encouraging and capable of 
finding comics for everyone.

“They don’t give you a ‘nerd 

test’ which the comic culture 
is guilty of in the past,” Drozd 
said.

Another huge factor in the 

openness of the culture has 
been the surge of comic-related 
community events, as they offer 
the chance to dispel people’s 
misconceptions about comics.

“I think events held by places 

like the Ann Arbor District 
Library, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, 
the 

Ann Arbor Art 
Center and 826 
Michigan reveal 
to 
the 
public 

that 
you 
don’t 

have to draw to 
make 
comics,” 

Drozd 
said. 

“That’s 
another 

misconception 
the general public 
has. But if you 
look at comics 
like 
“Sarah’s 

Scribbles,” 
“xkcd” 
or 

“The 
Amazing 

Cynicalman,” 
you see that they 
aren’t necessarily 
immaculate 
pieces 
of 

illustration that 
are 
beautiful, 

but 
they’re 

narratively 
beautiful, 
and 

that’s something 

everyone benefits from when 
we invite people to interact with 
the medium.”

Drozd can also see how the 

resurgence of superhero movies 
has impacted the comic culture 
in Ann Arbor.

“The movies have created a 

sense that these characters are 
culturally significant,” Drozd 
said. “Even if they haven’t 
improved comic sales, they have 
improved comic reputations.”

Though Ann Arbor’s comic 

culture has made great strides, 
Drozd feels there is still more 
space for not just inclusivity, but 
explicit inclusivity, as well as the 
celebration of authors of color 
or authors from marginalized 
communities. Drozd also finds 
it difficult to get cartoonists 
out of their studios to interact 
with one another and the 
public, making it problematic 
to 
organize 
conventions 
or 

community outreach events.

Drozd made the move to step 

out of his studio a long time ago, 
and he hasn’t looked back since.
