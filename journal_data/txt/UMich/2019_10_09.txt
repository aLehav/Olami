Touted as the cannabis capital 
of the Midwest, Ann Arbor 
is no stranger to recreational 
marijuana use. However, the 
city’s marijuana market may be 
undergoing a dynamic shift. This 
past week, Deputy City Attorney 
Kevin McDonald presented a 
first draft proposal for a points-
based 
scoring 
process 
for 
businesses seeking to obtain a 
permit to sell cannabis products. 
 
At 
a 
City 
Council 
meeting 
Monday, 
several 
councilmembers, 
including 
Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2, said they 
believe the topic requires further 
discussion.
“It’s a topic of considerable 
interest to residents and deserves 
more public discussion and 
input,” Lumm said. “I just think 
it’s critical to get it right,”
Points would be assigned 
to businesses based on four 

criteria: 
past 
performance, 
state compliance, location and 
community 
interest. 
Each 
category would be worth a 
maximum of 25 points. Past 
performance 
points 
would 
showcase the business’s influence 
and historical relationship with 
the city. 
State 
compliance 
points 
would measure how well the 
business has followed the city’s 
regulatory 
laws 
surrounding 
marijuana. 
Location 
points 
would portray how strategic 
a 
company’s 
geographic 
positioning in Ann Arbor is, 
considering the demographics of 
neighboring residents as well as 
competitive stores. Community 
interest points would measure 
the potential demand for the 
business in the market. 
The city is planning to limit 
the number of permits available 
for marijuana micro-businesses 
to 28. 

As the threat of climate change 
continues to provoke protests 
demanding institutional action to 
address the issue, student activists 
are calling on the University of 
Michigan to reduce its use of fossil 
fuels for powering facilities on 
campus. 
Last week, activists sprayed 
graffiti and wrote chalk messages 

on the Diag and other public outdoor 
locations claiming the University 
has $1 billion invested in fossil fuels. 
The 2018 Report on Investments 
corroborates this claim, stating 
the 
University 
allocated 
$1.12 
billion dollars, toward investments 
classified under natural resources. 
The report defines investments in 
natural resources as “investments 
in companies located primarily 
in the U.S. that produce oil and 
natural gas, and companies that 
service those industries, as well as 

non-energy related investments 
in minerals, mining, and wetland 
restoration.”
Zaynab Elkolaly, student at 
Washtenaw 
Technical 
Middle 
College 
and 
cofounder 
of 
Washtenaw 
Climate 
Strike, 
criticized 
the 
University’s 
investments in fossil fuels.
“The 
University, 
from 
an 
educational 
standpoint, 
has 
a 
great environmental curriculum 
where students fully understand 
the resulting detriment that comes 

with fossil fuel consumption,” 
Elkolaly 
said. 
“Students 
are 
not ignorant, and nor is the 
administration. What’s appalling 
is that these authority figures 
touting their prestigious degrees 
and positions are still involved in 
the very thing that is destroying 
the planet, simply because of profit. 
The University of Michigan is 
notorious for exploiting students 
financially, and this is only part of 
the pattern.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Center for Academic 
Innovation 
held 
an 
event 
Tuesday 
afternoon 
recognizing academic teams 
for 
their 
spring 
projects 
centered 
around 
diversity, 
equity and inclusion. This 
was the first in a series of six 

events, featuring eight teams 
giving a brief overview of their 
DEI project and how their 
project will serve specific 
groups on campus, ranging 
from undocumented students 
to the LGBTQ community.
The 
event 
began 
with 
Rachel 
Niemer, 
director 
for outreach and access at 
the 
Center 
for 
Academic 
Innovation, 
who 
echoed 

sentiments made at the 2019 
DEI Summit by Van Jones, 
CEO of REFORM Alliance, 
political 
commentator 
and 
host 
of 
“The 
Redemption 
Project” and “The Van Jones 
Show” on CNN.
“Those of us working in higher 
education are in a very unique 
position,” Niemer said. “We not 
only get to shape the experience 
of the learners on campus, but as 

they move out into the broader 
world, we get to shape the 
broader social structures that 
they will impact.”
Niemer explained how the 
mission of these DEI projects 
is to understand and assist 
individuals 
from 
various 
minority communities, which 
is necessary for our society to 
succeed.
The 
Detroit 
Board 
of 

Police 
Commissioners 

approved a policy Sept. 19 
outlining the use of facial 
recognition 
technology 
for 
the police department. The 
policy includes guidelines for 
how officers who abuse the 
policy will be punished and 
a prohibition from sharing 
the 
photos 
with 
private 
companies. 
The software has been used 
by Detroit police since July 
2017, when the Detroit City 
Council approved the software 
purchase. 
In 
June 
2019, 
Detroit Police Chief James 
Craig asked the City Council 
to approve its permanent use. 
Controversy 
surrounds 
the 
technology 
because 
of issues with the systems 
misidentifying people with 
darker skin. In a test done by 
the ACLU, Amazon’s facial 
recognition tool Rekognition 
falsely matched 28 members of 
Congress, disproportionately 
identifying them as people 
who had committed crimes. 
The 
false 
matches 
were 
disproportionately 
people 
of color, misidentifying six 
members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus.

Following an attempt to hack 
the voting app Voatz during the 
2018 midterm elections, the FBI 
revealed last week they have 
launched an investigation into 
the incident, which allegedly 
involved University of Michigan 
computer science students.
According to an article from 
CNN, 
anonymous 
sources 
revealed the FBI is investigating 
an 
individual 
or 
several 
individuals who tried to hack the 
app as a part of their University 
of Michigan election security 
course.
According to the EECS 498 
course description, the class 
teaches students how to hack an 
election in order to better defend 
against cyber break-ins.
“To defend a system you need 
to be able to think like an attacker, 
and that includes understanding 
techniques that can be used to 
compromise security,” the course 
description reads. 
Fifty-five 
percent 
of 
the 
students’ grades are determined 
by a large-scale group project 
related 
to 
a 
technical 
or 
tech policy topic on election 
cybersecurity. 
However, 
the 
description goes on to explain, 
the class will not allow students 
to directly break any laws.

Software to come to

The Life Sciences Institute 
at the University of Michigan 
received 
$45 
million 
in 
funding 
to 
advance 
their 
research initiatives, as a result 
of President Mark Schlissel’s 
Biosciences Initiative which 
was announced in November. 
One of their largest projects 
is 
the 
Expanding 
Natural 
Products Drug Discovery at 
the University of Michigan 
Biosciences Synergy Initiative, 
led by principal investigator Dr. 
David H. Sherman, medicinal 
chemist and professor in the 
College of Pharmacy. 
Utilizing their new funding, 
Sherman and his team have 
traveled around the world in 
search of natural products that 
could facilitate the creation 
of new life-saving drugs, such 

as antibiotics and anti-cancer 
agents, primarily in marine 
microorganisms. They scuba-
dived their way through Costa 
Rica, the Red Sea and Papua 
New Guinea, and most recently 
traveled to the Boiling River in 
the Peruvian Amazon.
Until its official scientific 
discovery in 2011, the Boiling 
River was thought to be a 
myth. The river reaches up 
to 200 degrees Fahrenheit 
with no apparent heat source, 
and maintains a culture of 
extremophiles 
and 
life 
in 
this extreme heat. Sherman 
was intrigued by the Boiling 
River because it is a sect of 
the Amazon River rich in 
biodiversity 
but 
virtually 
untouched 
by 
outside 
researchers. 
It took months for Sherman 
and his team to get the legal 
permits necessary to study the 

land and to take samples out 
of Peru to bring back to the 
U.S. However, Sherman said if 
there is a commercial success 
from the benefits of Peru’s 
natural products, then some of 
those benefits will go towards 
helping sustain the area of 
origin. 
On the ground in Peru, 
Sherman was accompanied by 
several members of his team, 
various 
researchers 
from 
National Geographic, Peru and 
Brazil, as well as educators 
and artists. 
“There were a number of 
other people there with us 
focusing on different aspects 
of that habitat in the Amazon, 
so we were there and it was 
pretty much science heaven,” 
Sherman said. 
The river, boiling for miles, 
hosts bacteria and natural 
products that could hold 
the genomic key to new 
life-saving 
medicines. 
Rosa 
Maria 
Cristina 
Vasquez 
Espinoza, 
a 
Peruvian 
fourth-year 
chemical biology student 
on Dr. Sherman’s team, 
recalled her experience 
in an interview with The 
Daily. 
Espinoza 
explained 
arriving at the portion 
of 
the 
river 
she 
was 
studyinging 
required 
a 
trek. 
It 
was 
quite 
inaccessible, she said.
“To get there there was 
no path at all — we actually, 
we had to get some of the 
locals to come at 7:00 a.m. 
one day and open a path for 
us, so it was a very virgin 
area,” Espinoza said.
The group of natives 
known as the Shipibo 
have lived in this part 
of 
the 
Amazon 
for 
thousands of years and 
assisted 
Sherman’s 
team 
to 
navigate 
the 
treacherous 
parts 
of 
the river. Despite the 
dangers, 
Espinoza 

enjoyed the expedition and 
has high hopes for the results 
of their research. 
“There are multiple benefits 
that we as humans can get 
out of this work, but I think 
that whatever results we get 
can also benefit the Amazon, 
especially in its critical times 
right now, where we are losing 
about two soccerfields of the 
Amazon per minute,” Espinoza 
said.
The Peruvian samples are 
due to arrive at the University 
within the next week, and are 
expected to be available for 
University-wide use within 
the 
next 
year. 
Ashootosh 
Tripathi, director of Natural 
Products 
Discovery 
Core, 
is 
a 
close 
colleague 
of 
Sherman and helps lead the 
Expanding Natural Products 
Drug 
Discovery 
project. 
Tripathi explained once the 
samples are in the lab, his 
team will work on isolating 
the 
microbes 
to 
expedite 
the process of further drug-
related research.
“Say if you have a drug 
target in mind, you can come 
to the center for chemical 
genomics, which is down the 
stairs, and access the library 
produced from these microbes 
and you can just screen it and 
let us know and know that hey 
we found these extracts that 
are active and what we will do 
is we will go deeper into it and 
find the molecule associated 
with it,” Tripathi said.
Ultimately, 
the 
team 
is 
hopeful about the implications 
of their research, particularly 
in regards to the potential 
it has for further life-saving 
drug development.
 “What we’re really excited 
about is when we find some 
brand 
new 
compound 
and 
get that kind of opportunity,” 
Sherman said.

CONFIDENCE IS KEY

700 demonstrate on Diag, show solidarity for Israel

October 10, 1973
A 
crowd 
of 
about 
700 
persons gathered peacefully 
on the Diag yesterday to 
express solidarity with Israel 
on the occasion of the latest 
outbreak of war in the Middle 
East.
The demonstration began 
with a short statement in 
Hebrew. The introduction was 
followed by a
short speech by Psychology 
Prof. Alexander Giuora. He 
claimed 
the 
Israelis 
were 
aware of Arab mobilization, 
but first move or risk being 
branded were counseled not to 
make aggressors in the court 

of world opinion. Israel had 
been betrayed, he concluded, 
attacked in a weakened state 
on their holiest day, Yom 
Kippur.
A BREAK in the speeches 
was provided by Jill Coliman, 
LSA, as she lead the crown in a 
song supporting life for Israel.
The 
main 
speaker 
of 
the 
afternoon, 
History 
Prof. Arthur Mendel, next 
addressed the rally. making
“I have addressed other 
rallies for other causes before, 
but this is the first
time I’ve spoken for my 
people,” 
he 
said. 
“During 
my recent trip to Israel I 

discovered my people and 
what they do mean to me.” 
The 
mood 
of 
the 
demonstration 
was 
far 
from 
militaristic. 
Speakers 
regretted that the bloodshed 
was taking place for any 
reason. Mendel emphasized 
that spirit when he said, “It’s 
obscene to rejoice in the 
destruction of our enemies, 
for in a fundamental sense 
they are our brothers.”
He quoted Golda Meir as 
saying, “We forgive you for 
killing our sons. We can not 
forgive you for making us kill 
yours.”
MENDEL concluded with 

an appeal for help. “If you’re 
just here for a cheap thrill or a 
tingle running and down your 
spine, it would be better if you 
stayed home,” he said. “Let 
your actions speak for your 
heart.”
A 
check 
at 
the 
United 
Jewish Student Appeal booth 
revealed that it was doing 
brisk business.
After a prayer for peace by 
the Reverend Ed Edwards and 
a few more songs, the rally 
ended.
The 
gathering 
was 
sponsored by the Coalition 
of Concerned Students and 
Faculty. The groups behind 

the name are the local Hillel 
organization and the Israeli 
Student Organization.
A spokesperson for Hillel 
added that in a larger sense 
the demonstration was really 
sponsored by
the people of the community 
rather 
than 
any 
formal 
organizations.
AS THE CROWD dispersed, 
the Arabs, who had been 
marching silently during the 
demonstration, began to chant 
slogans 
supporting 
their 
position in the Middle East.
President 
of 
the 
Arab 
Student Organization, Ahmed 
Beshareh, 
stated 
that 
the 

Arabs were there to show 
disagreement with what they 
termed the Israeli aggression. 
Beshareh said, “who started 
the war is immaterial. This 
is a continuation of previous 
hostilities and can’t be treated 
separately.”
“We are not aggressors,” he 
continued, “we’re attacking 
land which is our own. We 
support the various United 
Nations 
resolutions 
which 
call for an end to Israeli 
aggression.”
Following 
the 
afternoon 
 
demonstration, the Arabs left 
en masse.

Craig told The Detroit News 
after the approval the decision 
has been discussed for long 
enough and its purpose is to 
help the police department 
protect the community. 
“This is about the victims,” 
Craig 
said. 
“We 
took 
the 
community’s concerns to heart. 
I know some have felt we were 
not transparent during this 
process, but when we purchased 
this $1 million software, we 
had a conversation with City 
Council … so there was nothing 
secret about it.”
LSA senior Hannah Agnew, 
president 
of 
the 
Student 
Executive Committee of the 
Prison Creative Arts Project, 
said 
the 
continued 
use 
of 
facial recognition technology 
will only increase the divide 
between civilians and police.
“With a study the ACLU did, 
there were many issues with 
misidentifying Black folks and 
women,” Agnew said. “And 
with the way we already over-
police people of color, adding 
more surveillance is not going 
to help … People fear it and it 
creates distrust in the police 
system. We could be investing 
that money in services that let 
people prosper and that raises 
them up instead.” 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Rashida 
Tlaib, 
D-District 13, told The Detroit 
News she believed the software 
should be analyzed by only 
African Americans to avoid 
further 
misidentification 
of 
people of color. 
“Analysts need to be African 
Americans, not people that are 
not,” Tlaib said in a Detroit 
News video. “It happens all 
the time, it’s true — I think 
non-African Americans think 
African Americans all look 
the same. I’ve seen it even 
on the House floor, people 
calling Elijah Cummings ‘John 
Lewis,’ and John Lewis ‘Elijah 
Cummings,’ and they’re totally 
different people.” 
Craig told the Detroit News 
he believes Tlaib’s comments 
were 
insulting, 
adding 
all 
department officers and civilian 
employees receive bias training 
and should not be barred from 
jobs involving the software. 
“That’s 
something 
we 
train for, and it’s valuable 
training, but to say people 
should be barred from working 
somewhere because of their 
skin color?” Craig said. “That’s 
racist.”
Law 
student 
Michael 
Goodyear, 
who 
is 
editor-
in-chief 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Technology 
Law 
Review, 
said though the controversy 

surrounding the technology is 
valid, focus should be put on 
the software itself as opposed 
to those analyzing its results. 
“I think she (Tlaib) has a valid 
point, for sure, that visualization 
technology 
can 
be 
helpful, 
but it does have shortcomings 
that are particularly related to 
recognizing people of color,” 
Goodyear 
said. 
“That 
said, 
it is from a more technical 
standpoint, so it should mean 
reworking 
the 
algorithm, 
making sure the algorithm 
correctly identifies individuals, 
which 
obviously 
can 
have 
some biases from the coders 
themselves. But I think it is a 
maybe another separate move 
from what Representative Tlaib 
had said in those comments. So 
it’s not necessarily the person 
who’s using the algorithm, but 
the algorithm itself.” 
Facial recognition technology 
is used in everyday life through 
Facebook photo tagging, airport 
security and even in online 
dating applications. Goodyear 
pointed out it is also being 
used by other governments for 
more 
surveillance 
purposes 
but emphasized a need for 
regulation similar to Detroit’s 
in these situations. 
“The Chinese government 
has 
been 
using 
facial 
recognition 
technology 
to 
track the movements of certain 
Uighur groups in western China 
… that’s kind of the far, not 
great side of this technology,” 
Goodyear said. “The Chinese 
and Hong Kong governments 
have been using it in Hong Kong 
to actually track jaywalking in 
Hong Kong, which is maybe a 
little bit ‘big brother’. So it is 
important to — kind of like in 
what this ordinance is doing 
now — to draw boundaries of 
what’s acceptable behavior and 
what’s not acceptable.”
If 
facial 
recognition 
technology 
were 
to 
be 
implemented in Ann Arbor, 
Agnew said it would have 
similarly detrimental effects on 
the community.
“Anywhere you implement 
this it won’t have a good 
outcome 
because 
of 
over-
policing and over-surveilling,” 
Agnew said. “Ann Arbor likes to 
think of itself as a very liberal 
city, and this would be a way 
to police the already small 
numbers of people of color we 
have here.”
If the software were to be 
implemented in Ann Arbor, 
Goodyear said he hoped it 
would be with clear regulations 
and 
limitations 
in 
part 
produced through community 
engagement. He pointed out 
Ann Arbor’s smaller size and 
said the roles of the Ann Arbor 
Police Department and the 

University police would change 
how such technology could be 
implemented compared to in 
Detroit. 
“I think they’d definitely 
implement it in a different way,” 
Goodyear said. “But hopefully 
they’d do it in a similar way to 
Detroit, where they have public 
forums that allow things to be 
discussed publicly and actually 
create regulations to limit any 
sort of things might be going on 
like in China, or Hong Kong for 
example.”
Deputy 
Chief 
of 
Police 
Melissa 
Overton 
of 
the 
University’s Division of Public 
Safety & Security said the 
department has not discussed 
using 
facial 
recognition 
technology yet.
“We are always reviewing 
the 
latest 
technology 
that 
would assist law enforcement in 
solving crime, however, we have 
not discussed facial recognition 
at this time,” she wrote in an 
email to the Daily.
The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department did not respond to 
requests for comment in time 
for publication.
With regards to the primary 
controversy surrounding the 
software, Goodyear believes 
the 
technology 
still 
needs 
improvement. 
However, 
he 
emphasized 
the 
facial 
recognition technology would 
not be able to solely be used to 
indict or imprison a suspect. 
“They 
should 
be 
going 
through 
and 
making 
sure 
that it’s absolutely accurate,” 
Goodyear said. “But … no 
one’s going to be arrested and 
thrown in jail, indicted, based 
purely on their picture. Facial 
recognition technology so far 
is one factor. So under standard 
evidence, you need to have a 
variety of different things that 
kind of show that someone 
did something. In this case, it 
would be good evidence, but in 
and of itself, it’s not enough.”
Agnew argued there would 
be no positive outcomes from 
the 
continued 
use 
of 
the 
technology for both victims and 
those incarcerated. 
“With 
the 
criminal 
justice system we tend to 
disproportionately 
target 
people of color,” she said. “And 
that often doesn’t happen in a 
way that helps victims. They’re 
saying, ‘We’re going to use this 
system of surveillance to help 
victims.’ But how is it going to 
help victims? It’s not providing 
support or help to victims to 
deal 
with 
what 
happened, 
it’s just another way to police 
people.”

“Understanding 
individuals 
from 
communities 
that 
you 
haven’t 
been 
exposed 
to 
is 
critical,” Niemer said. “And most 
importantly, it’s not just about 
understanding them, but about 
developing the skills to learn how 
to understand them. These skills 
are critical for our own individual 
successes and also to the successes 
of our society.”
One of the featured projects 
presented 
at 
the 
event 
was 
introduced 
by 
Public 
Health 
senior Eryka Swank, whose team 
has partnered with the Spectrum 
Center to create an oral history 
project in celebration of the 
Spectrum 
Center’s 
upcoming 
50th anniversary. The two-year 
project will consist of a collection 
of interviews from past and 
current LGBTQ faculty and staff 
and alumni who will share their 
personal stories as members of the 
LGBTQ community.
“Our big hope is that we can 
highlight stories that are not 
typically heard,” Swank said. “We 

know that LGBTQ people are 
oppressed, and that our stories 
and experiences are stigmatized 
so being able to give them platform 
and allow our stories to be 
preserved for generations to come 
and for years to come is a really 
awesome thing.”
Swank said she hopes the 
project will give a voice to those 
who are oppressed even within the 
LGBTQ community.
“We’re trying to get a kind 
of equity of whose stories are 
known. I think it’s important 
to me because the visibility and 
representation on our campus 
I think is really important and 
a lot of times, even within the 
LGBTQ community, there’s still 
privilege and oppression,” she said. 
“Sometimes the stories of the most 
privileged LGBTQ people are the 
ones that we know, and so being 
able to try to get at all of them and 
know all the stories, good and bad, 
all the experiences, good and bad, 
and somewhere in between, is 
really important to me.”
Kim Lijana, director of Center 
for Educational Outreach and 
part 
of 
the 
Undocumented 
Students Knowledge Community, 
introduced 
another 
project. 

Her team’s project intends to 
create a course to help educators 
understand 
and 
support 
undocumented students in their 
pursuit of higher education, both 
on campus and before they arrive 
on campus. The course will consist 
of three modules, titled “What does 
it mean to be undocumented?”, 
“How can we improve college 
access 
for 
undocumented 
students?” and “How can we 
support undocumented students 
to succeed in college?” 
“The first module … is really 
giving 
additional 
information 
for people to better understand 
because it’s very complex, and for 
many educators, it’s like this is their 
first step into better understanding 
that there are even undocumented 
students in their school,” Lijana 
said. “So, we’re sort of thinking 
about this trajectory to make sure 
that we’re providing educators 
the information that they need to 
support student; that we’re really 
empowering them to understand 
that there is something you can do, 
as well as inspiring them to take 
action.” 

Andrew 
Berki, 
director 
of the Office of Campus 
Sustainability and member of 
the President’s Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality, 
explained these investments 
support 
the 
existing 
infrastructure 
for 
fueling 
vehicles as well powering 
and heating facilities. He 
said the Ann Arbor campus’s 
natural gas plant powers 
and heats Central Campus 
and the athletic facilities. 
The 
University 
contracts 
electricity from DTE Energy 
to 
power 
North 
Campus 
burns natural gas in boiler 
systems 
to 
heat 
North 
Campus buildings. 
According to Berki, the 
Ann Arbor campus emits 
approximately 
640,000 
metric tons of carbon dioxide 
into the atmosphere per year. 
Ninety-eight percent of Ann 
Arbor 
campus 
emissions 
are a result of burning fossil 
fuels to heat and provide 
electricity 
to 
buildings, 
and two percent of campus 
emissions 
come 
from 
the fuel burned to power 
transportation.
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel formed the 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
to 
create recommendations to 
achieve 
carbon 
neutrality 
on campus. One of the goals 
was to reduce emissions by 
2025 to 26 percent below 
2006 emissions levels. In 
a prior interview with The 
Daily, 
Schlissel 
expressed 
his concern regarding the 
logistics of carbon neutrality. 
“We use steam to heat 
the campus, and the only 
efficient way so far to make 
steam is to burn a fossil fuel 
or to have a nuclear power 
plant, (and) we don’t have 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant,” 
said Schlissel. “So, we want 
to 
understand 
what 
the 
condition and the cost is if 
we were to say we want to 

change the way we heat and 
cool the campus: would it 
cost us $100 million, would it 
cost us $1 billion?”
Berki described some of 
the efforts the University 
has taken in its push toward 
reducing 
emissions 
and 
achieving carbon neutrality. 
According 
to 
Berki, 
the 
University has already signed 
a commitment with DTE 
Energy to receive 200,000 
megawatt-hours 
of 
wind-
powered energy in the near 
future, which will reduce 
emissions by about 100,000 
metric 
tons 
of 
carbon 
dioxide. 
The 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality is also the process 
of hiring a firm to analyze 
the current infrastructure of 
how the University heats and 
powers Central, North and 
the Medical campuses. 
“They’re 
going 
to 
be 
coming up with strategies 
on how to move away from 
fossil fuels and possibly fuel 
our campus with carbon 
neutral options,” said Berki. 
“Of course, those strategies 
and options will have to 
meet the scale and reliability 
requirements to meet the 
mission of the institution, but 
that’s a huge effort that the 
PCCN has pushed forward, 
and we’re excited about it.” 
Jonathan 
Morris, 
a 
Rackham 
student 
in 
the 
School 
for 
Earth 
and 
Environmental Studies, was 
skeptical of the University’s 
ability to take meaningful 
action on reducing its carbon 
footprint.
“I think the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality is a good thing,” 
Morris said. “I would be 
a lot more excited if the 
University 
administration 
showed evidence that it will 
actually make a difference. 
While other universities are 
taking the climate crisis very 
seriously and fundamentally 
changing the way they do 
business, 
the 
University 
of Michigan seems more 
concerned with protecting 
its 
image 
and 
arresting 

students who are raising 
these issues.” 
Morris 
criticized 
how 
the 
previous 
University 
president’s 
Greenhouse 
Gas Reduction Committee 
created a 2015 report of 
recommendations 
that, 
according to Morris, was 
largely ignored.
“From my perspective, I 
don’t see anything different 
between that committee and 
the new PCCN in terms of 
accountability,” Morris said. 
“It would be wonderful for 
the PCCN to come out with 
bold recommendations for 
rapidly 
achieving 
carbon 
neutrality, 
but 
without 
any 
formal 
accountability 
measures 
in 
place, 
the 
University 
administration 
could just cherry pick a few 
things to improve the image 
of the University without 
taking 
meaningful 
steps 
toward decarbonization, as it 
did before.”
Elkolaly 
outlined 
what 
the University can do for 
improvement. 
“The 
U-M 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
Commission 
needs 
to 
be 
establishing 
dialogue, first and foremost,” 
Elkolaly said. “Students and 
staff have been completely 
in the dark and have only 
been 
responded 
to 
with 
unjust legal action. Once 
they actually agree to sit 
down and communicate with 
us about our concerns, we 
can take further, actionable 
steps.”
Berki 
argued 
reducing 
emissions and reliance on 
fossil fuels is a collective 
effort. 
All 
off-campus 
housing, he noted, is also 
fueled by fossil fuels, so 
reducing energy use off-
campus 
and 
individual 
actions remains important to 
limiting emissions. 
“I think it’s all of our 
responsibilities 
— 
faculty, 
students and staff — to 
take ownership around the 
issue and to do what we can 
individually to help attack 
this problem that we have,” 
Berki said.

Marijuana 
micro-businesses 
cultivate up to 150 plants and 
process, package and sell cannabis 
products to adults over 21, retail 
dispensaries and consumption 
centers.
Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 
D-Ward 1, said he voted for 
legalization in 2018 because he was 
a proponent of decriminalization, 
not because he wanted more 
facilities opening up in Ann Arbor. 

“I didn’t vote for Prop 1 to have 
600 distribution and consumption 
facilities open in my community,” 
Hayner said. “And I have had 
people come up to me and say 
they have legitimate concerns 
about the placement of these, and 
legitimate concerns about large 
money flowing to the cities that 
do allow this use and it driving 
out other businesses that serve a 
broader portion of the community.”
Current businesses in Ann 
Arbor that sell cannabis products 
have city permits they must renew 
on an annual basis. The new points-
based application system will affect 

how 
these 
already-established 
marijuana facilities comply with 
the city’s licensing rules as well as 
their annual renewals.
According to the Marijuana 
Regulatory Agency, failure to 
comply with the department’s laws 
may result in nonrenewal of the 
business’s license. 
“A 
state 
operating 
license 
shall not be renewed unless the 
department has determined that 
the individual qualifications of 
each person required by the act 
and these rules is eligible, qualified, 
and suitable as part of the license 
renewal in accordance with the 
relevant 
licensing 
standards 
set forth in the act and these 
rules,” the Michigan Marijuana 
Regulatory Agency wrote in the 
policy statement. 
This 
shifting 
legal 
aspect 
of regulations will also impact 
businesses looking to enter into the 
Ann Arbor marijuana market. 
Once the policy is set, if the 
state starts to receive more license 
applications than the limit of 
28, it will mean an increase in 
competition between the new 
cannabis businesses looking to 
set up shop in Ann Arbor. The 
decision of selecting applicants is 
at the discretion of the city, rather 
than the state, and according to 
McDonald, whether applicants are 
“best suited” to operate in the city 
will depend on the compliances 
of the Michigan Regulation and 
Taxation of Marihuana Act. 
Recreational 
marijuana 
businesses need a city permit 
in addition to state licensing to 
operate, with the annual city fee 
being $5,000. Michigan will start 
accepting 
license 
applications 
starting Nov. 1 of this year.

“Under 
some 
circumstances, even probing 
for weaknesses may result in 
severe penalties, up to and 
including 
expulsion, 
civil 
fines, and jail time,” the 
description 
explains. 
“Our 
class policy is that you must 
respect 
legal 
and 
ethical 
boundaries of vulnerability 
testing at all times, or else you 
will fail the course.”
Voatz, 
a 
Boston-based 
mobile 
elections 
company, 
uses blockchain and current 
smartphone 
technology 
to 
make it possible for voters 
to 
participate 
in 
various 
elections 
through 
their 
phones. The company was 
founded in 2015 and has since 
processed nearly 80,000 votes 
in 30 separate elections.
During the 2018 election 
cycle, 
it 
was 
revealed 
that 
Voatz 
experienced 
an 
unsuccessful 
security 
breach targeted at votes in 

West Virginia. Since 2018, 
West Virginia has permitted 
members of the military and 
those living overseas to vote 
through Voatz. At a press 
conference on Oct. 1, CNN 
reported Mike Stuart, the U.S. 
Attorney for the Southern 
District of West Virginia, was 
told the IP addresses matched 
those at the University.
“During the 2018 election 
cycle, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Warner referred to my office 
what he perceived to be an 
attempted intrusion by an 
outside party into the West 
Virginia 
military 
mobile 
voting system,” Stuart said 
at the press conference. “No 
legal conclusions whatsoever 
have been made regarding 
the conduct of the activity or 
whether any federal laws were 
violated.”
Nimit 
Sawhney, 
Voatz 
CEO and co-founder, wrote 
in a statement to The Daily 
there 
was 
no 
detectable 
security breach, but the FBI’s 
intervention is necessary to 
avoid any potential hacks in 

the future. 
“The Voatz system worked 
as designed and intended,” 
Sawhney wrote. “The attempt 
was detected, thwarted at 
the gate and reported to the 
authorities. We fully support 
the West Virginia Secretary 
of State’s office and the law 
enforcement 
agencies

T

he United States often 
likes to tout the checks 
and 
balances 
in 
its 
governmental system, which exist 
for the purpose of constraining 
the power of various groups and 
individuals. Even under President 
Donald Trump, the checks and 
balances 
system 
has 
proved 
somewhat successful: Many of 
Trump’s most outrageous ideas 
have been stymied or watered down, 
preventing 
social 
and 
political 
catastrophes.
However, there is a fundamental 
problem with the idea of checks and 
balances: It only functionally exists 
on a domestic level. With regard to 
foreign affairs, the president has 
almost unilateral power to act as he 
chooses. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s 
foreign policy has deviated from 
norms in dangerous ways as a 
result. Trump’s legitimization of 
autocratic governments, inability 
to respect multilateral diplomacy 
and American allies, and bizarre 
indecisiveness in the Middle East 
has left America weaker abroad. 
It has also enabled human rights 
abuses and tarnished America’s 
reputation as a strategic partner. 
To begin, the most glaringly 
problematic aspect of Trump’s 
foreign policy is his eagerness to 
bond 
with 
autocratic 
regimes, 
legitimizing and empowering their 
oppressive policies. Since taking 
office, 
Trump 
has 
abandoned 
the American policy of publicly 
condemning international human 
rights violations, instead choosing 
to praise autocratic leaders. This is 
most noticeable through Trump’s 
ties with Kim Jong-un of North 
Korea and Mohammed bin Salman 
of 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
two 
leaders 
with whom he has cultivated 
relationships. Trump has met with 
Kim three times, beginning with 
the 2018 summit in Singapore. 
Since then, Trump has talked about 
receiving a “beautiful” letter from 
Kim and earlier this year visited the 
North Korean border, making him 
the first sitting American leader to 
ever cross over. In his negotiations 
with Kim, Trump has focused 
almost 
exclusively 
on 
creating 
personal connections for the end 
goal of nuclear disarmament, a 
dangerous maneuver. Through this 
approach, Trump is legitimizing 

Kim’s 
leadership 
style 
and 
normalizing North Korea’s heinous 
human rights abuses, which he has 
continually failed to call out, instead 
treating them as collateral in the 
disarmament negotiations. 
Trump’s 
relationship 
with 
Mohammed 
bin 
Salman, 
the 
Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, has 
been quite similar. As with Kim, 
Trump has been more than willing 
to overlook Salman’s grotesque 
violations of human rights for 
personal benefit. For Trump, the 
value of Saudi Arabia’s friendship is 
largely financial. In 2017, the Saudi 
government signed a deal with the 
Trump administration to purchase 
$8 billion in arms. Even when 
confronted with the problematic 
nature of his relationship with 
Salman – via both a legislative bill 
blocking the most recent Saudi arms 
deal and a CIA report confirming 
Salman’s role in the death of 
journalist 
Jamal 
Khashoggi 
– 
Trump has remained unmoved. He 
vetoed the bill and ignored the CIA 
report. Through his friendship with 
Salman, Trump is not only implicitly 
supporting the oppression of Saudi 
people in Saudi Arabia, but also 
actively contributing to the ongoing 
war and humanitarian crisis in 
Yemen. Just like with North Korea, 
Trump’s fixation on personal gain 
in Saudi Arabia has legitimized their 
abhorrent human rights violations 
and undemocratic practices and lent 
credence to leaders whom the United 
States should not be supporting. 
In addition to bonding with 
autocratic dictators, Trump has also 
chosen to forsake many of America’s 
longstanding allies, shunning them 
in favor of right-wing populist 
leaders. Since World War II, the one 
constant in America’s oft-changing 
foreign policy has been support 
for NATO. However, Trump has 
attacked this relationship, criticizing 
many NATO members (particularly 
Germany) over their low levels of 
military spending.
While 
disparaging 
America’s 
traditional 
allies, 
Trump 
has 
simultaneously 
built 
personal 
relationships with many right-
wing strongmen with whom he 
sees himself as aligned. During his 
term, Trump has spoken about his 
“great relationship” with Philippines 
President 
Rodrigo 
Duterte, 

ignoring Duterte’s inhumane and 
problematic drug policies, which 
include 
carrying 
out 
violent, 
extrajudicial attacks on drug users. 
Similarly, Trump has developed an 
overwhelmingly positive rapport 
with 
Brazilian 
President 
Jair 
Bolsonaro, 
despite 
Bolsonaro’s 
unwillingness to protect native 
Amazonians, or the rainforest itself. 
While these are just two examples, 
the list goes on: Trump has worked 
to build positive relationships with 
many other populist right-wing 
leaders, such as Viktor Orban of 
Hungary. 
Lastly, Trump’s incoherent and 
indecisive politics in the Middle 
East have emboldened opposition 
forces and contributed to increased 
violence in the region. One of 
Trump’s first priorities as president 
was to remove the United States 
from the Iran Nuclear Deal, which 
he called “one of the worst and 
most one-sided transactions the 
United States has ever entered into.” 
However, his strategy since then has 
been completely incomprehensible; 
he took a hardline stance and 
placed 
crippling 
sanctions 
on 
Iran, then appeared completely 
unwilling to respond once the 
Iranian government lashed out 
against these sanctions. This flip-
flopping has emboldened Iran and 
lead to increasingly forceful attacks 
and risks inciting a larger conflict 
between the two nations. 
However, 
Trump’s 
approach 
toward 
negotiating 
with 
the 
Taliban in Afghanistan has perhaps 
been even more disastrous than 
his negotiations with Iran. Most 
notably, Trump impulsively ordered 
the removal of all troops from 
Afghanistan immediately at the end 
of 2018, a catastrophic idea which 
was vehemently opposed by former 
defense secretary Jim Mattis. Since 
then, Trump has been continually 
negotiating with the Taliban over 
the removal of U.S. troops and 
was unmoved by critics who said 
negotiating with the Taliban would 
empower the group and legitimize 
their violence as a form of opposition 
against the Afghan government.

Rethink privatizing mental health services
I

n an unprecedented move on Sept. 30, Michigan Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer vetoed line items in a budget of nearly $1 billion of state 
spending, including a provision to increase the privatization of 
mental health services. This provision is an effort to cut costs that 
involve pilot projects that combine Medicaid-managed care plans for 
physical health with the Medicaid-managed mental health system, 
which is regulated by 10 regional pseudo-public health plans. 

As 
Whitmer 
and 
the 
legislature 
reevaluate 
the 
budget and reallocate funds for 
state spending, there is much 
to consider about health care 
expenditures and what we as a 
society prioritize in terms of who 
should and who should not have 
access to care. 
In broad terms, privatization 
in health care is the involvement 
of a third-party sectors other 
than 
the 
government 
in 
providing and regulating health-
related services. What started 
off as a mechanism to provide 
comprehensive health services 
to the public that the government 
cannot keep up with has slowly 
emerged as profitable, with private 
health care companies setting 
unrealistic costs that patients are 
forced to pay for coverage. The 
funding of mental health care is 
a multi-layered dilemma. Along 
with potentially propagating a 
dangerous stigma surrounding 
this class of illnesses, sometimes 
this discussion can take away 
from the patients receiving true, 
effective treatment. 
The implications of privatizing 
mental health care are endless. 
First, 
mental 
health 
is 
an 
umbrella 
term 
encompassing 
a host of illnesses, including 
suicidal 
ideation, 
substance 
abuse, depression, anxiety and 
bipolar disorder, among many 
others. Roughly 4.5 percent of 
adults in Michigan suffer from a 
serious mental illness. Of these 
individuals, almost half of them 
receive appropriate treatment for 
their respective conditions, with 
the other half battling cultural 
barriers and stigma. Privatizing 
mental health care will only 
exacerbate these barriers, as it 
limits access to those who can 
afford the potential premiums. 

The lack of access for underserved 
populations can result in the 
mentally ill being untreated or even 
ending up in the prison system. 
This result can further perpetuate 
the stigma that the health care 
system strives to alleviate: that 
those who are suffering from 
mental illness have no hope, are 
undeserving of our attention and 
are inextricably linked with crime 
and incarceration. Public mental 
health facilities increase access 
and awareness. 

The 
current 
public-driven 
health care system acts as a safety 
net system, particularly for low-
income individuals, and operates 
with the incentive to offer as 
many services as needed. The 
Republicans’ proposed provision 
in the 2020 state budget bill 
pushes the Michigan health care 
system toward becoming more 
privatized, which has immediate 
consequences. First, there will be 
an initial 9-percent funding cut 
toward client-based needs. This 
would put more than 300,000 
Michigan residents who depend 
on 
the 
current 
health 
care 
system at risk of losing many of 
the services they receive. These 
potential negative effects all stem 
from the fact that privatized 
health care services, while they 
may still offer relatively high 

amounts of services for patients, 
will largely shape their services 
and infrastructure in a way that 
maximizes the amount of money 
being produced. This creates an 
incentive for them to cut back 
on services and raise their costs, 
which will only target low-income 
and rural families who already 
struggle under the current system.
A 
popular 
argument 
for 
privatizing the Michigan health 
care 
system 
suggests 
that 
integrating mental and physical 
health services (as was proposed 
under the budget bill) is more 
efficient because it would better 
address overall patient health and 
could provide administrative cost 
savings. While it may produce 
administrative 
cost 
savings, 
those savings would be at a 
huge loss. Privatized Medicaid-
managed 
care 
plans 
aren’t 
typically 
structured 
with 
a 
focus on mental health services 
and could cut corners to save 
costs, which appears realistic 
considering it is profit-driven. 
Furthermore, integrating the two 
health services could potentially 
decrease 
necessary 
funding 
toward the mental health branch, 
which already is in desperate 
need of cash under the current 
state system. There have also 
been studies on the success of 
privatized health care systems, 
and the evidence largely does 
not support it. Marcia Angell, a 
contributing writer to the U.S. 
National Library of Medicine, 
stated that for-profit care is almost 
always more expensive and offers 
subpar treatment compared to 
public service. In a state lacking 
a comprehensive mental health 
system, the opportunity to rework 
a budget to allocate monetary 
resources is more crucial now 
than ever before.

The funding of 
mental health 
care is a multi-
layered dilemma.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I

n light of the recent chaos of 
our political scene, movements 
bringing awareness to sexual 
assault 
survivors 
have 
gained 
more traction now than ever. The 
hashtag #MeToo was first coined 
in 2006 by grassroots activist 
Tarana Burke and truly paved 
its way into mainstream media 
two years ago. The movement 
urges women to write #MeToo to 
show the magnitude and impact 
of sexual assault. Alyssa Milano, 
an American activist and actress, 
tweeted, “If you’ve been sexually 
harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ 
as a reply to this tweet” on October 
15, 2017. A year later, a study by the 
Pew Research Center found that 
#MeToo was used over 19 million 
times on Twitter, and there were 
more posts around news events. 
The hashtag has undoubtedly 
enabled many women and sexual 
assault survivors to speak up and 
stand in solidarity with others, but 
it has also unveiled many other 
systemic problems that desperately 
needed to be addressed. 
Three years ago, Americans 
listened to our current president on 
tape say, “when you’re a star, they 
let you do it. You can do anything.” 
Two years ago, the #MeToo 
movement was kicked off after 
sexual assault allegations were 
brought against Harvey Weinstein. 
Just one year ago, we watched 
Brett Kavanaugh, another man 
accused of sexual assault, get 
confirmed as a Supreme Court 
justice. Now, more than ever, 
Americans want change.
Over the past few years, many 
powerful men have had sexual 
assault 
allegations 
brought 
against them. News like this 
makes the headlines for a little 
while, but is soon superseded by 
something larger, allowing people 
like Kavanaugh to slip our minds 
momentarily. But people haven’t 
forgotten entirely, and events like 
the election of President Donald 
Trump, the #MeToo movement 
and the Kavanaugh hearings have 
helped lead a fundamental shift 
in how men in power, even in the 
government, are viewed by the 
American people. A study done by 

research firm PerryUndem shows 
that 49 percent of the people 
polled agree with the statement, 
“One reason Justice Kavanaugh 
was confirmed is because white 
men want to hold onto their power 
in the government.” Over the past 
few years, there has been fresh 
chatter about the balance of power 
in society, and partners at the firm 
believe people may be taking these 
thoughts to the ballot boxes.
In another Undem poll, half 
of the voters thought about the 
implications 
of 
men 
having 
more power than women in 
government after the Kavanaugh 
hearings. When Dr. Christine 
Blasey Ford stood in front of an 
audience composed of mostly 
men and testified, her words and 
trauma were not enough to stop a 
man from being admitted to the 
country’s highest court of law. A 
feeling of overwhelming dread 
and helplessness was cemented 
into the minds of many Americans 
that day. It was clear that men held 
more positions of power, and that 
those men did not value justice 
for victims of sexual assault or 
harassment. 
Ford 
coming 
forward 
to 
reveal her trauma should have 
immediately changed the course 
of action taken by government 
officials. 
Imagine 
the 
sheer 
number of women who do not 
have the resources, time or 
support to ever come forward 
with 
information 
on 
their 
assaulter. The survivors who do 
come forward can never truly 
be vindicated. Yet, people still 
have the nerve and ignorance to 
ask why survivors do not want 
their names revealed and why 
they “wait so long.” Credibility is 
questioned, attempted political 
scams are assumed. Women and 
survivors are never just believed. 
Granted, everyone should be 
legally afforded the right to be 
assumed innocent until proven 
guilty, but we must do this by 
pressing for justice. Survivors 
deserve better. Women deserve 
better. Anyone who is sexually 
assaulted deserves better, and 
they deserve to live without 

having to watch their assaulter sit 
in a position of power over other 
women. 
Everything 
starts 
with 
reporting. 
According 
to 
the 
University of Michigan’s Office 
for Institutional Equity, after 
#MeToo went viral in the fall of 
2016, reports of sexual assault 
and sexual harassment increased 
by 
62 
percent 
on 
campus. 
However, of the 152 reports 
that fell under the policy, only 20 
investigations were conducted and 
only 10 completed. In the end, only 
three cases found students to be in 
violation of the University’s policy 
regarding sexual and gender-
based misconduct. This reminds 
us that change must be made at 
institutional levels and begins 
individually. To get anything into 
a legal review system, it must 
be reported first. The increased 
reporting of sexual assault or 
harassment 
is 
not 
inherently 
reflective of anyone’s improved 
confidence in the legal system – 
rather it reflects the confidence in 
the conviction that they will at least 
be heard. 
We must respect anyone who 
speaks up about sexual assaults. 
Creating 
a 
more 
inclusive 
environment 
for 
supporting 
survivors 
is 
imperative 
for 
destroying 
the 
contempt 
and 
uncertainty that inevitably arrive 
when someone comes forward 
with their story. Per the National 
Sexual 
Violence 
Research 
Center, sexual assault or rape is 
the most underreported crime 
in the country. Without formal 
complaints or reports to the police 
or authoritative figures, sexual 
assault perpetrators cannot be 
reviewed, much less brought to 
justice. College campuses must 
make it easier to report, bring 
and prove statements of sexual 
assault. Protecting survivors from 
the rigors of proving these claims 
and enabling trained professionals 
to understand the traumas of 
these individuals is essential for 
the breakdown of institutionally-
protected perpetrators.

Chanel stunned with classic silhouettes, Cecilie Bahnsen was nothing 
short of a textural dream and Valentino has us prepping our summer whites, 
and it’s only the Oct. 9. From Paris, Milan, Copenhagen to New York, Fashion 
Month was a whirlwind. To say that Daily Style is brimming with inspiration 
on the cusp of these shows would be an understatement. 
In the style of a brilliantly styled Man Repeller piece, Daily Style has 
decided to try our hand at recreating some of the runway’s most sought 
after moments. Easier said than done of course, considering especially the 
closets of college students and that we spend at least five days a week in and 
out of classrooms; not the most ideal runway. But, these limitations forced 
us to get creative, to extrapolate from the looks of fashion month, to build 
a new approach to getting dressed, to include more than just an elite group 
in a couture conversation. This exploration was a chance to rethink how we 
approach our closets, to mix and match, no matter how comical or far off the 
results may be. If nothing else, these recreations were an excuse to play dress 
up, and who would say no to that? 
— Margaret Sheridan, Style Beat Editor 
I can’t stress how difficult it was to choose a favorite look from Collina 
Strada’s sustainably-minded Spring Summer 2020 collection, entitled 
“Thank You Very Much for Helping Me,” but I settled on this one for the 
sense of urgency it conveys. The beige top, emblazoned with a childlike 
drawing of a globe and the show’s titular phrase, is an eerie reminder of 
what little time we have to combat climate change. A mesh bag replete 
with produce is slung over the model’s left shoulder, giving the impression 
that she’s hurrying home from the farmer’s market to toss locally-sourced 
potatoes into her energy-saving fridge (yes, she lives in Bushwick). Tied 
together with a billowing patterned skirt, thin beaded belt and chunky 
sandals, the look represents everything I want the fashion industry to 
become as it starts taking responsibility for its environmental impact.
My recreation of this outfit is far from precise, but I tried to stay true to 
its central themes. Layered above my years-old turtleneck (and untucked 
for accuracy) is a graphic tee I screen-printed for September’s Global 
Climate Strike — I feel like it exudes a similar energy to the original 
look’s. My skirt is reminiscent of the slip style from the show only in that 
it contains the color orange, but I’m fine with that. A thin chain-link belt 
functions as my take on the beaded version, and my favorite pair of pink 

platform Tevas felt right in the footwear department. But the aspect of 
my faux-Collina Strada look I’m most proud of is, by far, the bag of kale I 
brought out of my fridge for the occasion. 
— Tess Garcia, Daily Style Writer
As I started pairing outfits together for this piece, I quickly found myself 
surrounded by the entirety of my closet on the floor, overwhelmed at the 
potential for new outfit anatomies. Not to say that any of the pieces I have 
selected exactly make sense together, in fact, this outfit walks a fine line 
between multiple seasons. At its core, however, this outfit is extrapolated 
from the key moments and pieces I saw on the runway. 
When considering my design icons, I looked no further than the Dries 
Van Noten Spring 2020 Ready-to-Wear collection, a landscape of florals, 
polka dots and damn good jackets. While my recreation of this look 
is far from accurate, I tried to center my iteration around the color and 
textural relationships at play between base layers and a power jacket 
on top. Drawn to the lavender billowing pants, I reached for a pair of 
thrifted lilac bermudas that tie at the waist. A Zara blouse — that I am 
shamelessly wearing backwards — attempts to embody the airy, high 
neckline slip seen on the model. As for a layer over these pieces, I went 
back and forth between my signature orange puffer and a blue faux fur 
number, ultimately deciding on the latter, given the way the texture of 

the jacket anchors the original look in the Van Noten show. Although the 
dusty blue coupled with the lilac is not nearly as dreamy as the lilac and 
neon orange moment that happened on the runway, the faux fur seemed 
like too much of a focal point to disregard. To top it off, I again reflected 
color in footwear, selecting a pair of subtly wedged minty green mules, 
their finish and hue coming close to the characteristics of those on the 
model. So, while my recreation makes it unclear as to whether I’m headed 
to bed, the beach or to brave a tundra, I certainly felt empowered while 
grappling through the curation of my outfit. That holds more weight to me 
than any designer coat. 
— Margaret Sheridan, Style Beat Editor 
Jean cut-offs (sometimes known as “jorts”) and a blazer have never stood 
out to me as two things that naturally fit together. The first I associate with 
hot temperatures in my native Los Angeles backyard and then the other I 
group with what I wear to an interview where my future is on the line: 
two very different states of mind. However, Givenchy proved me wrong 
this year, topping off their wide use of jorts with formalwear. According 
to W Magazine, Givenchy’s Artistic Director, Claire Waight Keller, was 
inspired by ’90s fashion after reading a book by Allison Yarrow titled, 
“90s Bitch: Media, Culture, and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality.” 
Therefore, Keller made ’90s fashion her goal but put a spin on it that she 
called “liberated femininity” in which she altered popular looks from 
these decades to appear more free, strong and a little bit grunge. With my 
own personal style being very casual and sticking to a single theme, this 
look was a little more difficult for me to get down. I decided to settle for a 

more casual tee as opposed to a professional button down shirt because 
besides being safer, it also channels what I see “liberated femininity” to 
be. I finished it off with high heeled black boots thinking it would exude 
the toughness that Keller was looking for. In my mind, my outfit illustrates 
that I don’t lose sense of who I am or my power in the workplace when 
surrounded by toxic masculinity. I am a professional and do my work, but 
I am not eager to please when it comes to sacrificing my morals. 
— Sophia Hughes, Daily Style Writer
According to Fashionista, Marc Jacobs included a review of his Spring/
Summer 2002 show at his namesake label in this season’s shownotes. The 
show took place on the day before Sept. 11, 2001, and spoke of how the joy 
expressed in that collection eerily encapsulated an era before the panic, 
before the earth-shifting events that were to take place the very next 
morning. Closing out NYFW SS20 on Sept. 11, 2020, the inclusion could 
not be more appropriate. This collection, in his words, is “a celebration of 
life, joy, equality, individuality, optimism, happiness, indulgence, dreams 
and a future unwritten.” This review has only grown in accuracy over 
time, as the United States quickly evolved into a surveillance state led by 
fear and hatred after those tragic events. This collection was about taking 
a pause and celebrating life during a time that runs several parallels to 
the time that review was published. In a sociopolitical sphere that feels as 
though every day has to be a fight and turning on a news channel or simply 
tapping the twitter app on our phones can trigger an anxiety attack, 
allowing ourselves the space to feel the pulse that makes life worth living 
is absolutely vital. On days when I feel anxious and want to hide, I spend a 
little extra time on my appearance as a way to give myself that extra push 
to get through it all. This ridiculous sequin pantsuit and red mockneck 
combo brings me joy, I hope it does the same for you!

Recreating four of our favorite Fashion Month looks

STYLE NOTEBOOK

I was catching up with a friend that I hadn’t seen 
in a while last week and we started talking about 
making music. Now, I’m a proponent for scenes to be 
supportive places for new artists to share their art, so 
when they expressed a desire to play at least one show 
by the time they graduated, I strongly encouraged 
them to. “But my songs aren’t very good … I’ve barely 
written anything,” they protested. They seemed 
to have this underlying fear that they shouldn’t be 
allowed to perform because they didn’t know how a 
sound system worked, or had only written a few songs 
here and there and had never really performed them 
in public before.
I don’t know if you’ve ever been to a DIY show, but I 
can assure you, they are, and I cannot emphasize this 
enough, not full of virtuosos that are about to bring 
about the next Golden Age of Music. And that’s OK 
— they in no way need to be. This environment was 
created in order to give artists a platform that they 
normally wouldn’t have if they didn’t have a wealth 
of experience and connections. Sometimes, artists 
forget their chords, melodies or even lyrics when 
they’re on stage, and that’s part of the beauty of it. 
With DIY, perfection is in the imperfection. These 
shows are humble, intimate and full of opportunities 
to explore new artistic directions.
I think that over time, these spaces, which stem 
from underrepresented people creating a space to 
call their own, started to shift into a more commercial 
environment that demands a certain almost polished 
sound at times. I’ve been at many shows where an 

artist bravely stands in front of a crowd for the first 
time as their voice shakes because of how nervous 
they are, and while most of the crowd offers constant 
cheers and support, others sit towards the back and 
snicker. Not only does this reject the origins of DIY, 
but it discourages others from sharing their works — 
its intended purpose in the first place.
You might say that it’s easy to just “forget the 
haters,” but as someone that has experienced the 
anxiety of sharing personal projects with an audience 
and still refrains from doing it too often, I know that 
that’s much easier said than done. Artists put not only 
a lot of time, but a lot of emotion into their work, and 
the thought of exposing themselves only to be laughed 
at and metaphorically pushed to the side is terrifying.
Now, I don’t think that’s to say that criticism should 
be swapped with fluffy words of praise that lack 
substance. I think constructive criticism is absolutely 
essential for artists to grow and improve their art. 
If you know an artist well enough, giving them 
suggestions is a great way to promote their growth. 
But tweeting about, say, how bad the vocalist for 
PBR and the Rolling Rocks is, does nothing but emit 
negativity into the world.
In case it wasn’t apparent, I think DIY is really 
special. The fact that people care enough about music 
and art that they could convert their basements into 
venues for lesser-known, possibly unconventional 
bands and artists to have opportunities they normally 
wouldn’t is exemplary of the passion that fuels the 
scene. It’s not about putting on shows with groups 
that have been around for years and years. DIY is 
about allowing new artists to come into their own, 
experiment, and share their experiences with an 
audience.

Cox’s Corner: DIY is an
expressive environment

RYAN COX
Daily DIY Columnist

DIY COLUMN

“10 Minutes and 38 Seconds in this Strange 
World” begins with the end. Leila Afi — who had 
substituted the ‘y’ in her name to the atypical 
‘i’ to change ‘yesterday’ for ‘infinity’ — is dead, 
strewn against a dumpster in an alleyway. Yes, 
physically her heart stops beating, but her brain 
hasn’t shut down yet — and it won’t be, not for 
another 10 minutes and 38 seconds. In those 10 
minutes, the readers are taken on a journey into 
her heart-wrenching past — a past littered with 
picturesque memories from munching on sugary-
sweet wax with Leila’s aunt and mother to much 
more tragic moments that led to her eventually 
life as an Istanbul sex worker. 
Shafak goes all in with this set-up. We don’t 
just start at Leila’s birth, but at the moment of her 
conception. When Leilia’s mother was pregnant 
with her, she paid considerable care and made 
sure to take the necessary precautions. 
“She had not touched a single peach so the 
baby wouldn’t be covered in fuzz; she had not 
used any spices or herbs in her cooking so the 
baby wouldn’t have freckles or moles; she had not 
smelled roses so the baby wouldn’t have port-wine 
birthmarks. Not even once had she cut her hair 
lest their luck also be cut short. She had refrained 
from hammering nails into the wall in case she 
mistakenly hit a sleeping ghoul on the head. After 
dark, knowing too well that the djinn held their 
weddings around toilets, she had stayed in her 
room, making do with a chamber pot.”
It’s difficult not to fall in love with Shafak’s 
prose. Shafak recognizes the significance of 
minute details. Sights, smells and tastes come 
unbidden. I felt like I was surrounded within 
the Turkish atmosphere and culture during the 
mid-20th century. Shafak treks the life of Leila, 

using each minute to represent a milestone. She 
doesn’t stray from this methodology for the 
majority of the novel. In fact, she chronologizes 
historic landmarks alongside Leila’s growth. We 
learn of John F. Kennedy’s assassination and 
of Trotsky’s influence in Turkey. For the most 
part, this style works. One knows what to expect: 
Minute two is Leila’s adolescence and minute 
three is her hormonal teenage years. Spliced 
within this consistent technique are snippets of 
Leila’s friend’s perspective — the “five” as Leila 
so carefully dubs. The change in perspectives 
takes away from the flow of the narrative. At 
first, I faithfully read through each character, 
but then found myself skimming as I progressed 
deeper into the book. Some of Leila’s friends 
only appeared for a brief segment of the book — 
I couldn’t reconcile their significance to the plot 
with their random chapters. 
More than the style, it’s easy to be tired by 
Shafak’s cyclical narrative. Don’t get me wrong, 
I felt my eyes sting more often than not while 
reading “10 Minutes and 38 Seconds,” but soon, 
the plot became predictable. I really wanted to 
like this book, but I couldn’t muster the same 
level of empathy I had at the beginning. What 
once seemed like an apt way to shed a humanistic 
lens on the life of a sex worker in Turkey ends 
up holding a darker implication of romanticism. 
Shafak shies away from delving into the vulgar 
and vile aspects that come with the high-risk 
lifestyle. Continually, we circle around Leila’s 
way of life. We read about the musky smell of sex 
in the room, but not the sexual acts themselves. 
Instead, much of the plot is spent detailing the 
beauty encompassing Lelia’s brothel. While 
there are merits in highlighting the beauty in 
horror, “10 Minutes and 38 Seconds” is generally 
disappointing. With its topic, the novel could’ve 
done more to bring awareness to the exploitation 
of women in Turkey back then and now.

‘10 Minutes’ is short of great

PROBATE

He may not have been terrifying, but his 
rap sheet is. His music inspires chills, but of a 
different kind — more soul-penetrating than 
spine-tingling. His eccentricity, while alarming, 
lends itself to good, old-fashioned rebellion and 
artistic chaos. 
The Vatican banned one of his songs. He 
had an affair with Brigitte Bardot — the literal 
personification of the French Republic’s La 
Libérte, Marianne (Bardot was the model for 
the bust of Marianne c. 1969). He once burned a 
500-franc note on television to make a statement 
to his immense wealth. He talked endlessly to 
cab-drivers and the “common people” who were 
brushed aside in the day-to-day. 
His name was Serge Gainsbourg, a man of 
immense talent for music, show-biz flair and 
pearl-clutching shock value. One of the most 
prolific French artists of his time, Gainsbourg’s 
legacy continues to live on well after his 
passing in 1991. And now, I hope to contribute 
to the cultivation of Gainsbourg’s memory by 
introducing our readership to the man himself. 
But first: The song banned by the Vatican? “Je 
t’aime moi non plus.” Listen at your own peril. 
The Vatican, somewhat dramatically, banned the 
song for a reason. Keep your headphones plugged 
in for this one.
Second: If you’re new to this worldwide 
worship of Gainsbourg, start with “La chanson 
de Prévert,” “Les femmes c’est du chinois,” 
“L’anamour” and “Couleur café,” to name a few.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “If one of 
his songs was so far out there that it got banned 
by the Vatican, how could I possibly know what 
I’m listening to? I don’t speak French! It’s too 

risky.”
Well my friends, have you heard of Google 
Translate?
All jokes aside, part of the thrill of listening to 
music in another language is the mystery of the 
lyrics. Sure, you could always find a translation. 
But before that, you have the opportunity to 
experience the song in an incredibly pure form. 
One can appreciate the music, its composition, its 
instrumentation and the artist’s vocal inflection 
without the intrusion of lyrics. 
As for myself, I didn’t understand any of 
Gainsbourg’s songs initially — I fell in love with 
his voice before I discovered anything else about 
him. 
When pressed to name a specific album (and 
prove my musical street cred), Gainsbourg’s 
L’étonnant Serge Gainsbourg (1961) is a personal 
favorite. The album features a softer side 
to 
Gainsbourg’s 
notoriously 
“adventurous” 
reputation. Deep, buttery (I know how that 
sounds) vocals backed by beautiful orchestration 
are breathtaking. Featuring a mix of traditional 
French, jazz (“Les femmes c’est du chinois”), 
and classic 60’s “bops” (“Le sonnet d’Arvers”), 
L’étonnant 
Serge 
Gainsbourg 
has 
it 
all. 
Gainsbourg’s music also contains subtle touches 
of African and Latin stylistic flairs. It’s a good, 
fleshed out introduction to a musician whose 
career spanned decades, a man who walks the 
line between myth and legend. 
Hours, days, weeks (maybe years?) could be 
dedicated to writing about, to and for Gainsbourg. 
Unfortunately, I’ll be too busy listening to his 
music to write the epic he deserves. So for now, 
this will have to suffice. 
Take a listen to Serge Gainsbourg this week 
and fall in love (like I have) with a man whose life 
was just as exhilarating as his music is. It’s worth 
getting to know the man, not just his lyrics.

For love and Gainsbourg

MUSIC: WHAT I’M LISTENING TO

UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP

If someone fed a computer program all of 
Stephen King’s novels, and asked it to write 
something using all it had learned, it would 
give us “In the Tall Grass.” All the stereotypical 
tropes are there. There’s the deranged father and 
hysterical mother of “The Shining,” the temporal 
shifting of “The Dark Tower,” and the Americana 
setting attacked by an inhuman threat from “It” 
(and most of his other novels). The problem is, “In 
The Tall Grass” lacks the heart of even the most 
mediocre Stephen King story. There’s nothing to 
care about here, and even less to be scared of. 
This movie struggles 
to make one care from 
the start. A conversation 
in the opening scene 
tries to introduce these 
characters — a brother 
and sister on a road trip 
through the Amerian 
heartland. However, it 
only establishes bare-
minimum, 
cookie-
cutter 
traits, 
and 
is 
soon interrupted. The 
siblings are called into a 
grass field by a little boy, 
who says he is lost. These unfortunate siblings are 
soon thrust into a violent, otherworldly time loop 
that is never explained, even at the most basic of 
levels. Throughout this movie, the viewer is too 
busy trying to understand what is happening to 
care about who it is happening to.
Yet all it does is establish some unoriginal traits 
that do little to entice the reader and are soon 
ignored in favor of the horror plot. While Stephen 
King’s novels, and the best King adaptations, 
inject even the wildest situations with a human 
core, “In The Tall Grass” is utterly cold. 
This film could have still been modestly 
enjoyable if the threat it spent all its screen time 
on was at least intriguing. Sadly, even that is too 
much to ask. No matter how inventive the camera 
work is or how creepy some of the set pieces are, 
“In The Tall Grass” fails to be frightening in 
any memorable way. It is easier to let one of the 
main characters explain why: “It doesn’t make 
any sense.” None of it does. Not the grass, the 
grass people, or the giant rock that is apparently 

controlling the whole charade. Grass, also, is just 
not that scary. What is this evil force trying to 
accomplish? There’s no reason for what it does 
other than to frighten people — and theoretically 
the viewer — by luring them into an endless field. 
Ambiguity can be incredibly horrific when 
handled correctly. “It Comes at Night” and 
“Annihilation” 
are 
perfect 
examples 
of 
a 
mysterious concept whose inexplicability is used 
to frightening effect. Those movies, however, 
have screenwriters behind them who understand 
concepts like subtlety, pacing and basic character 
development. “In The Tall Grass” just slings 
as much violence and surreal imagery at the 
viewer as it can. Instead of making things scarier, 
though, the deluge just becomes oversaturated. 
There’s no buildup; it’s 
just a loose collection 
of ineffective pieces. 
Some 
attempts 
to 
be 
frightening 
end 
up 
being 
brutally 
laughable. 
The 
villains 
sing, 
speak 
in rhyme and have 
an 
obsession 
with 
Christian 
references, 
all 
of 
which 
come 
across humorously and 
slaughter any sort of 
tension. 
The acting does not help, either. Patrick 
Wilson (“The Conjuring”) does his best, but his 
dedication is grating to watch when nobody else 
is giving even half the effort he is. The other 
performances are straight out of an old episode 
of “Goosebumps,” with the dialogue to match. 
Characters give melodramatic, overindulgent 
speeches that would’ve been cut from even 
the most atrocious high school Halloween 
productions. The conversations also run on a 
track, like a haunted house ride — if one has seen 
enough horror movies, they could literally fill in 
the blanks.
The final act is a tired retread of “The Shining,” 
without any of the deep scares or existential 
questions that made Jack Torrance’s story a 
classic. Even worse, this movie gives its female 
characters almost no sense of agency. They’re 
tokens for the men to fight over, brutally attack 
and threaten with sexual assault. 
“In the Tall Grass” is predictable, muddled and 
forgettable. Skip this one. 

Don’t go ‘In the Tall Grass’

FILM REVIEW

In the Tall Grass

Netflix

At its barest, Salman Rushdie’s newest 
“Quichotte” is a show of impressive needlework.
From the get-go, Rushdie’s got his thread and 
his needle, poised to bind: His materials are 
several stories, wholly different plot-scapes and 
universes and dimensions, all constructed and 
ready to be sewn together. And Rushdie does just 
this. In his nearly 400-page epic, he lies out vastly 
distinct storylines — from a pastiche of “Don 
Quixote” to a modern take on a brother-sister 
relationship — and spends time wrapping them 
tightly together. By the end of “Quichotte,” it’s 
almost difficult to tell the stories apart.
But this simplifies “Quichotte” to a degree 
almost disrespectful of the calculated, deeply-
intentioned plot Rushdie has created. The 
novel principally follows a character under the 
homebrewed alias of Quichotte, a stable but 
delirious sexagenarian who, emerging from 
his habit of obsessive reality television binging, 
decides to pursue Miss Salma R, a talk show 
host he decides is, simply and indubitably, the 
one for him. He initiates a quest across the 
U.S. (which includes traversing the so-called 
“seven valleys”— think a fanatical pilgrimage) to 
pursue the admired. Along the way he imagines 
a son, Sancho, into existence. The two encounter 
extreme bigotry. They pass through a town 
where people turn into mastodons. A gun speaks. 
Absurdity saturates the trip.
Embroidering efficiently and at full speed, 
Rushdie works in two stories that progress 
alongside the chapters of Quichotte’s adventures. 
There is Miss Salma R, the host Quichotte 
so desires, with her devastating past and her 
present opioid addiction. Then there is Dr. Smile, 
Quichotte’s relative and the corrupt architect 
of InSmile, an opioid product directed at those 
vulnerable to addiction. These stories drift on 
their own alongside Quichotte’s until they merge 
with the main character’s in the final chapters.
Then, — yes, there is more — there is Sam 
DuChamp, the author penning Quichotte’s 
story in real time. He’s a moderately successful 
spy novelist leading a life moderately similar 
to Quichotte’s, save the delusions. As the tale of 
Quichotte’s universe gradually unravels, Sam’s 
story is told also.
“Quichotte” is — not only at its inception, but 
constantly — overwhelming. Rushdie fits a story 
with the breadth of Donna Tartt’s “The Goldfinch” 
and the chaos of a Vonnegut novel in a relatively 
small space. Somehow, though, this insanity never 

quite feels like disorder. Despite the tug-of-war 
between plots and several frankly unbelievable 
scenes, there is never a sense that Rushdie has lost 
control of his work. The reigns are secure. Rather, 
as one reads on, “Quichotte” manages to make 
more sense as themes reappear and the storylines 
settle into one another. Quichotte’s relationship 
to his sister and his concern for his son begin to 
line up with the diegetic author, Sam’s, story. By 
the end of the work, the two stories all but become 
one.
This refrain of contestation (between the 
author’s life and his fiction; between Quichotte’s 
past and present) tempers “Quichotte” just 
enough. It also offers tastes of passages that, 
although bred in an environment of disarray, 
manage to foster intimate moments:
“As the Trampoline (Quichotte’s sister) spoke, it 
was almost as if there were two Quichottes in the 
room, a version from the past as well as the present 
one, and that as the past was superimposed on the 
present it caused a sort of blurring, because the 
two versions were so unlike each other that it was 
difficult to see the Quichotte in the room clearly, 
as he now was, and he himself was a victim of the 
same confusion, not able to with any degree of 
ease to free himself from the trap of what he had 
once been.”
In a book drowning in overarching political 
themes and a muddled plot, spaces like this are 
gasps of air above the waves. Rushdie can both 
continue the chaos and also make Quichotte — and 
his author — human and recognizable to readers.
Rushdie pulls off his broad and absurdist plot, 
but something about “Quichotte” undeniably still 
falls flat of spectacular. The writing, while piercing 
at moments, curls too much into Rushdie’s run-on, 
detail-filled style. It makes the work, especially 
the first quarter and even some action-packed 
scenes (like that with the mastodons) draining to 
read. Then there’s Rushdie’s jab at the extremes 
of racism and Islamophobia in the United States, 
which, although revisited by Rushdie in an OK 
manner in the final chapter, feels mishandled. 
Rushdie lines up racial incidents one after another 
in the course of 20 pages and then forgets about 
them, a feat that feels like indecision between 
satire and genuine commentary.
It’s the age of “anything can happen,” Rushdie 
so accurately declares throughout “Quichotte.” 
This is, after all, 2019. Anything, it seems 
sometimes, can happen, to both the writer 
and what is written. The daring literary foray 
into this modern wildfire of chaos has earned 
Rushdie a spot on the Booker Prize shortlist. If 
the judges have have a stomach for the absurd and 
extravagant, he may just win.

‘M’ struggles in first road matches

Facing 
top 
teams 
like 
Vanderbilt, 
Georgia 
and 
UCLA, the Michigan women’s 
tennis team had its first real 
opportunity 
to 
gauge 
its 
competition and itself, and 
they didn’t appear to be up to 
the challenge. 
The results from the four-
day Women’s Collegiate Classic 
in Malibu were mixed. The 
Wolverines started strongly 
with wins in Thursday’s first 
round 
matches. 
Freshman 
Andrea Cerdan edged out No. 15 
Christina Rosca of Vanderbilt 
in a close match, taking two 
of three sets by a slim margin, 
6-4, 3-6, 7-5. While Cerdan 
stumbled in the second round 
— losing two consecutive sets 
6-2 — the freshman’s ability 
to win against highly-ranked 
players makes her an integral 
part of Michigan’s program as 
the season goes on. 
Junior Alyvia Jones and 
senior Giulia Pairone also had 
solid wins on day one, but 
neither could translate these 
victories 
into 
momentum. 
Jones and Pairone had very 
similar performances in the 
second round, each losing the 

first set by a large deficit and 
narrowly losing the second, 
7-5. With these losses, the 
Wolverines spent the rest of the 
weekend playing consolation 
games in which they lost nine 
out of 12 matches. 
“We definitely need to get 
better,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “We need to 
get fitter.”
Michigan 
didn’t 
fare 
much better in 
doubles match 
play. Jones and 
Cerdan 
won 
handily against 
a Stanford duo, 
6-1, 
but 
fell 
in the second 
round, 
6-2, 
to 
California. 
Similarly, 
Pairone and senior Chiara 
Lommer beat San Diego only to 
be bested by California in the 
following round. 
“It was a long weekend and 
it showed on Sunday, where 
I didn’t think we were at our 
best,” Bernstein said. “It was 
our first trip (this year) and 
the first trip for (Cerdan). 
Definitely by the end of the 
week, they looked a little 
drained. We had a couple of 

kids who were taking exams 
on the road and taking more 
exams 
(Monday). 
That 
is 
always challenging.”
This 
weak 
performance 
may be a byproduct of the 
Wolverines’ 
transition 
to 
playing on the road. Last 
weekend, 
Michigan 
came 
away 
from 
the 
Wolverine 
Invitational in Ann Arbor with 
twelve 
singles 
and five doubles 
wins. 
Whatever the 
cause, Bernstein 
is 
far 
from 
discouraged. 
She views the 
weekend as the 
first data point 
in a long season. 
“I 
wanted 
to see how we 
match up,” Bernstein said. “You 
have 12 teams and probably 
eight of them are top-10 teams. 
We brought some of our top 
players there to see where we 
are at this stage, early October.
“Clearly, we need to get 
better. 
Results-wise, 
we 
weren’t there. It is not always 
about results and we have 
a few months to clean some 
things up before we start dual 
matches.”

Hallahan’s evolution as a player 
key to Wolverines’ success of late

Jack Hallahan is an Energizer 
Bunny. 
On Sunday, the senior forward 
was all over the place. He 
pirouetted through defenders 
with ease, scrambled down 
field on numerous breakaways 
and dished out two assists, en 
route to a 3-0 victory for the 
Michigan men’s soccer team 
(5-2-3 overall, 2-0-2 Big Ten) 
over Northwestern (5-5-1, 1-2-1). 
From the onset, Hallahan 
made 
his 
presence 
known, 
terrorizing 
the 
Wildcats’ 
defenders with crafty footwork 
and dazzling speed.
Opposing 
coaches 
have 
braced for facing Hallahan since 
he stepped on the collegiate 
pitch his freshman year in 2016.
Since then, Hallahan led 
the team in points over his 
sophomore and junior seasons, 
notching nine and eight goals, 
respectively.
And 
2019 
is 
looking 
no 
different. Now in his final 
campaign, Hallahan has already 
proven that he remains a force 
to be reckoned with.
But his role has evolved.
This season, the Wolverines 
deploy a 4-4-2 formation, as 
opposed to the 4-4-3 formation 
they ran in the past, meaning 
that Hallahan, a forward by 
trade, is playing further back, 
deeper 
into 
the 
Michigan 
midfield.
No longer playing the true 
forward position, Hallahan’s 
role in the Wolverines’ offense 
has elevated from the team’s 
premier 
goal-scorer 
to 
a 
dangerous, 
multi-dimensional 
facilitator. By playing closer 
to 
the 
midfield, 
Hallahan 
is consistently swarmed on 
all fronts by opponents who 
attempt to stifle his eruptive 
style of play, opening up the field 
for his teammates.
“There is a lot of attention on 
Jack Hallahan. (Teams) know 
who No. 11 is,” said Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 
Daley. 
“He’s 

finding other ways to impact 
the team. (And) other guys are 
benefitting.”
The 
threat 
of 
Hallahan 
has allowed forward play to 
prosper, with graduate student 
Nebojsa Popovic and sophomore 
Derek Broche leading the team 
in goals, with six and three, 
respectively.
While 
Hallahan 
recorded 
an impressive 15 assists in his 
sophomore and junior seasons 
combined, he already has six 
assists just over halfway into his 
senior campaign.
Hallahan’s first assist on 
Sunday came at a much-needed 
time for the offense. 
After standing scoreless with 
Northwestern at halftime, the 
Wolverines built off mounting 
confidence carried over from 
the 
first 
half. 
Despite 
the 
score, 
stringent 
defensive 
play and numerous offensive 
opportunities fueled the team’s 
belief in its abilities. 
“We had some really good 
chances (in the first half) and 
were competitive,” Daley said. 
“Defensively, 
we 
gave 
our 
chance to win the game that 
stayed contagious throughout 
the game.”
Four minutes into the second 
half, following an arching corner 
kick 
from 
Hallahan, 
junior 
defender Jack Ragen headed the 
ball towards Carlos Tellez. The 
junior midfielder placed the ball 

past Wildcat goalkeeper Miha 
Miskovic to give Michigan the 
lead, 1-0.
Just 
four 
minutes 
later, 
Hallahan helped to facilitate the 
second goal of the day. Weaving 
through 
Northwestern’s 
defensive lines, Hallahan passed 
the ball off to Ybarra. Ybarra 
then hit Popovic in stride, who 
rocketed a shot past Miskovic.
With only one goal thus far 
on the season, one might expect 
frustration 
to 
emerge 
from 
Hallahan given his goal-scoring 
pedigree. 
Quite the contrary.
“It’s more about creating 
opportunities than putting it 
away at this point. For me, I got 
my goals last year,” Hallahan 
said. “It’s better for the team in 
a way. We’ve got two great goal 
scorers up top still.”
Whether 
controlling 
the 
pace of the offense, eyeing up 
goal-scoring opportunities or 
pestering defenders with his 
agility, Hallahan has proven 
that his value on the field is 
greater than his goal-scoring 
statistics.
“He’s trying to make the right 
decisions at the right times and 
pick out the right players for 
the right reasons,” Daley said. 
“He really is a selfless player. He 
works for the team. When you 
have a big time player like that, 
it’s very contagious throughout 
the group.”

Former assistant, Haynes, making immediate impact at Maryland

ROSEMONT, Ill. — When 
John Beilein shook the college 
basketball 
world 
with 
his 
sudden 
decision 
to 
leave 
Michigan in May, the impact 
was felt beyond Ann Arbor and 
Cleveland.
Most of the country woke 
up to the news, with ESPN’s 
initial report coming before 
sunrise on the East Coast. After 
preaching 
a 
family 
culture 
throughout 
his 
decade-plus 
with the Wolverines, Beilein’s 
players and staff learned of his 
decision the same way everyone 
else did.
It didn’t take long for the 
ripple effects to reach College 
Park. When Maryland coach 
Mark Turgeon heard of Beilein’s 
departure, he thought back to 
a phone call he received from 
Beilein two weeks earlier. After 
one of Turgeon’s assistants left 
for a head coaching vacancy at 
Morgan State, Beilein called 
him to put in a good word for 
his three assistants — Saddi 
Washington, Luke Yaklich and 
DeAndre Haynes.
Knowing 
the 
trio 
was 
seasoned 
under 
Beilein’s 
lauded 
basketball 
mind, 
Turgeon’s interest was piqued. 
So when Turgeon first heard 
of his counterpart’s exodus, he 
phoned Washington. The two 
had a productive conversation, 
culminating in an agreement 
to check in again once the new 
head coach formed his staff.
Just over a week later, Juwan 
Howard was hired as Beilein’s 
successor. It took him about 
a month to finalize his staff, 
but Turgeon waited patiently. 
Howard retained Washington 
as the lone holdover, while 
defensive 
mastermind 
Luke 
Yaklich left for an associate 
head coach position at Texas.
Haynes, on the other hand, 

was left in limbo. Shortly after, 
he 
connected 
with Turgeon.
The first time 
they 
spoke, 
Turgeon 
knew 
he’d found his 
guy.
In 
his 
two 
years 
under 
Beilein, Haynes 
coached 
the 
backcourt 
and 
plotted offensive 
strategies. Still 
only 35 years old, he most 
recently worked closely with 
senior 
point 
guard 
Zavier 

Simpson and former Michigan 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole. 
With 
Terrapin guard 
Anthony Cowan 
Jr. returning for 
his senior season 
and 
junior 
guard 
Darryl 
Morsell looking 
to take the next 
step, 
Turgeon 
would’ve 
been 
hard-pressed to 
find a better fit.
Since arriving at Maryland, 
Haynes has proven it. When 
Cowan 
was 
asked 
about 

Haynes’ early impact at last 
week’s Big Ten 
Media Day, his 
eyes lit up.
“That’s 
my 
guy,” 
Cowan 
said. “Definitely, 
as soon as he 
walked 
in, 
it 
clicked 
for 
us 
immediately.
He’s 
definitely 
helping 
our 
team 
out 
tremendously 
and like I said, we clicked as 
soon as he got on campus and 
we started getting work done 

immediately.
“With 
DeAndre, 
one 
thing Michigan 
had that a lot 
of people really 
don’t 
look 
at 
too 
in-depth 
is 
Michigan’s 
spacing 
was 
awesome. That’s 
what made their 
offense 
really 
good and that’s 
something that 
he’s helping me and helping us 
with.”
For 
Cowan 
and 
Morsell, 

Haynes’ personality has made 
all the difference.
“The first thing I realize 
about (Haynes) is he seems like 
a great family man,” Morsell 
said. “He and his wife had their 
kids around, and that just shows 
you what type of individual 
he is and what he values. He’s 
been a great help for us. He’s 
like the coach I’ve never had 
since I’ve been in college. I’ve 
definitely enjoyed his time 
since he’s been (at Maryland). 
From the perspective that he 
played and had success while 
he was playing, he brings 
another dimension. He’s great 
with film. He’s a great coach all 
around.”
Added Cowan: “Just as a 
person, (Haynes) relates to 
his players really well. I think 
he’s a player-person and a 
players’ coach. He’s someone 
that I really do trust in terms of 
basketball knowledge.”
With fall practices in full 
swing, Turgeon has also taken 
notice of Haynes’ immediate 
impact. 
A 
former 
Mid-
American Conference Player of 
the Year, Haynes learned the 
rigors of leading an offense at 
Kent State from 2002-06. He 
returned to the Golden Flashes 
as a coach prior to spending a 
year at Toledo before joining 
Michigan’s staff.
But that’s a figment of the 
past at this point. The same 
group of players he coached 
to the Sweet 16 a year ago has 
become his competition — and 
vice versa. Now, he’s making 
strong impressions in the early 
stages of his role on a new staff.
“(Haynes) is a classy guy, 
he’s a family guy, he relates 
well to the players,” Turgeon 
said. 
“He’s 
a 
really 
good 
basketball coach, my players

Patterson, Harbaugh stick by offense as questions simmer after Iowa win

Shea Patterson wore a pink 
bomber jacket and stood in 
the center of the circle. For 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
surrounding 
the 
Michigan 
football team he leads, for all 
the 
criticism 
and 
sarcastic 
comments, and — for that matter 
— for all the questions lobbed 
at the senior quarterback, his 
demeanor 
was 
remarkably low 
key.
Three 
days 
earlier, 
Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
declared 
that 
the Wolverines’ 
offense 
was 
hitting its stride. 
Two days after 
that, 
Harbaugh 
doubled down.
“In 
all 
areas,” 
Harbaugh 
said, when asked specifically 
where 
he 
saw 
that 
stride 
coming. “The run game, pass 
game, protection. Quarterback, 
receiver, running backs. They 
are, it’s an evolving, improving 
group and I’ve seen them be at 
a really high level at practice, 
consistently at a really high 
level in games. And getting that 
consistently high level in both 
games and practice is what I 
feel what I see coming.”
Then he filibustered, going 
over a number of drives in the 
second 
half 
of 
Michigan’s 
win over Iowa, 
almost 
making 
you believe that 
there was some 
promise shown. 
Penalties killed 
one 
drive, 
a 
blown 
trick 
play 
killed 
another. A third, 
towards the end 
of the game, consisted of the 
Wolverines trying to kill the 
clock and let their defense win 
the game. Harbaugh credited 
Iowa’s 
defense, 
which, 
it 
should be noted, ranks ninth 
in SP+. Then his tone reached 

an inflection point and, for 
the first time since he stepped 
to the podium an hour after 
Saturday’s game, it didn’t seem 
like he was just selling a line 
about the offense.
“I feel with our team, the 
effort is great,” Harbaugh said. 
“Off the charts. At the highest 
level. And when you get that, 
then you can get everything 
else.” 
When Patterson took his turn 
the 
next 
day, 
though, he was 
left to deal with 
the reality.
Michigan 
ranked 
25th 
in 
offensive 
SP+ 
last 
year. 
It brought in a 
new coordinator, 
Josh 
Gattis. 
Through 
a 
month 
of 
the 
season, it ranks 66th in the 
same category. Pick whatever 
number 
you 
want 
— 
the 
Wolverines are probably down. 
As Patterson and others pointed 
out, they are 4-1, their fate still 
in their hands. But the numbers 
seem to portend things getting 
worse once the tough part of the 
schedule comes around.
“When coach Gattis first 
got here, he was talking to us 
about how if we want to score 
more points, we gotta run 
more plays,” fifth-year senior 
left tackle Jon Runyan Jr. said 
Monday. “The best teams in 
the country are 
out here scoring 
at 
least 
42 
points per game 
and I think we 
averaged 
just 
under, maybe like 
34 last year. So 
that’s something 
that we tried to 
do heading into 
the season. 
“And we did 
that against Rutgers. Obviously 
didn’t do that against Wisconsin 
or Army or last game (against 
Iowa).”
So there was Patterson on 
Tuesday, trying to explain away 
the answer to questions that 

will eventually play itself out 
on a football field against Penn 
State, Notre Dame and Ohio 
State.
Is the problem on offense as 
minimal as Harbaugh made it 
out to be? And how does it get 
fixed? 
“I think that 
there’s a lot that 
you guys don’t 
see, 
that 
the 
fans don’t see,” 
Patterson 
said. 
“They make their 
adjustments 
on 
defense, we make 
our adjustments 
on offense. And 
we 
aren’t 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
explosive, but I do believe that 
there’s a lot left out there. And 
the sky’s really the limit for 
this offense. It’s just a matter of 
time.”
He was asked to expand on 
what, specifically, people aren’t 

seeing.
“I could go on for days,” he 
said. He ultimately went on for 
less than 30 seconds.
“I don’t know if you guys 
could fully dissect a defense but 
there’s certain things that they 
take away or have gameplans for. 
And we make 
our adjustments. 
But we’ll get it 
together.”
Within 
the 
muddled nature 
of 
Michigan 
football’s 
message, 
the 
vague 
outlines 
of the problem 
came 
into 
focus. Patterson 
acknowledged that Gattis is 
experiencing 
growing 
pains, 
just as most people would in 
their first go around at a new 
job. He said the Wolverines 
could do more to amplify their 
talent at receiver — something 

the chorus of voices outside 
of 
Schembechler 
Hall 
has 
clamored for all year. He used 
the language of growth and 
positivity, just as Harbaugh did 
a day earlier, saying Michigan 
took what was there against a 
stout defense.
Of course, that does little 
to change the reality of the 
season’s first five games. The 
Wolverines have struggled to 
move the ball in all but one of 
those. And, this weekend’s bout 
at Illinois aside, the schedule is 
about to enter an unforgiving 
stretch. It’s one thing to say 
that Michigan should use Nico 
Collins, Donovan Peoples-Jones 
and Tarik Black more liberally. 
It’s another to do it.
“We believe in our coaches, 
we believe in each other,” 
Patterson said. “Just taking it 
day-by-day. First five weeks, 
we’ve played three of the top 20 
defenses and we’re 4-1, so just 
gotta keep getting better.”

Offense seeks more explosive plays

While Jim Harbaugh stood 
in front of the media Saturday 
afternoon — and again on 
Monday — to declare that 
Michigan’s offense is “hitting 
their stride,” the numbers tell a 
different story.
Unless this is the Wolverines’ 
stride, in which case there’s a 
different conversation to be had. 
That’s beside the point.
What’s not is this: Josh 
Gattis came in with a plan 
to 
revolutionize 
Michigan’s 
offense and bring it into the 
modern era of college football. 
Through five games, the unit is 
down 51.7 yards and 7.2 points 
per game from a season ago, 
when it was roundly criticized 
as antiquated and inefficient.
Among the keys to changing 
it all — according to fifth-
year senior left tackle Jon 
Runyan, one of few players to 
acknowledge the struggles — 
is increasing the number of 
explosive plays.
“That’s what this offense is 
all about, is being explosive,” 
said senior quarterback Shea 
Patterson, 
“and 
letting 
our 
playmakers go make plays.”
And yet, despite Patterson 
himself saying the offense is 
“right where we want to be,” as 
he did Tuesday evening, those 
plays have been near-impossible 
to come by.
According 
to 
defensive 
coordinator Don Brown, the 
Wolverines consider explosive 
plays to be runs of 12 or more 
yards or passes of 16 or more 
yards. In Saturday’s 10-3 win 
over Iowa, they had just two of 
each.
“We 
pride 
ourselves 
on 
explosive plays, and we know 
that we have a quota that we 
have to get and meet,” Runyan 
said. “And we didn’t meet that 
this week when we had two 
explosive run plays and two 
explosive pass plays. And that’s 
not gonna cut it if we’re gonna 

try to win against these teams.”
As 
Runyan 
acknowledges, 
Michigan 
managed 
to 
“somehow” win anyway. That 
somehow is its defense. The 
Wolverines, though, know their 
defense isn’t going to bail them 
out every time.
In September’s 35-14 loss at 
Wisconsin, that’s exactly what 
happened. The defense folded 
and the offense — billed as this 
team’s calling card all spring — 
managed just 14 points. Beneath 
it all was a pitiful, singular 
explosive play before the game 
was well out of hand late in the 
second half.
By the final whistle in 
Madison, Michigan had five 
explosive plays. Zero came on 
the ground.
“I feel like in the run game, 
explosive plays just come down 
to hand placement,” Runyan 
said. “Whether it’s by a guard 
keeping his block or myself or 
Jalen keeping our head inside 
the defender or where best we 
can find a seam.”
The blame, though, goes 
well beyond the offensive line. 
While Patterson said Tuesday 
that he’s content with his play 
so far, the numbers tell the 
story of a quarterback who 
hasn’t found the same success 

he did a year ago.
When junior wide receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
was asked about the lack 
of explosive plays, he said: 
“When I have an opportunity 
to touch the ball, gotta make an 
explosive play.” In three games 
since returning from injury, he 
has just three explosive plays 
— all against lowly Rutgers.
It 
all 
stands 
in 
direct 
contrast 
to 
Gattis’ 
grand 
offseason proclamations, when 
he told his team their 35.2 
points per game wasn’t good 
enough and pointed out that 
the best teams in the country 
average at least 42, according 
to Runyan.
This year, that was his 
challenge for the Wolverines.
“And we did that against 
Rutgers,” Runyan said, before 
pausing. “Obviously didn’t do 
that against Wisconsin.”
He paused again.
“Or Army.”
Another pause.
“Or last game.”
So, despite his confident 
proclamations, when Patterson 
was asked whether explosive 
plays can help Michigan reach 
“the next level,” he could 
muster only one word.
“Definitely.”

Wolverines’ penalty kill shows 
signs of increased aggression

The repeated sound of a 
stick clashing against the ice 
reverberated throughout Yost 
Ice Arena on Sunday.
Clank, clank. Clank, clank.
Noise had already filled the 
atmosphere — the roar of the 
crowd, shouts of the players, 
even the rattling of the glass as 
puck and body clashed against 
it. But the clanking of the stick 
pierced through it all.
The clock on the screen that 
hung over the ice ticked down, 
informing all of the time left in 
the period. In one of the corners, 
another timer counted down. 
This one was for the penalty.
As the penalty clock hit 
below 10 seconds, the Windsor 
goaltender started his tirade 
against the ice, letting his 
teammates know their power 
play was coming to a close. 
Clank, clank. Clank, clank.
And soon after, the sound from 
the goaltender was muted, and a 
new set of clanking stick sounds 
followed. The skaters on the 
Michigan hockey team’s bench 
smacked their sticks against the 
boards, as if to give a round of 
applause to the penalty killing 
unit for successfully fending off a 
Lancer man-advantage.
In the exhibition game against 
Windsor, the Wolverines held 
their opponent to zero power-
play goals on four attempts and 
put their new, aggressive penalty 
kill system on full display.
“Our 
goals 
are 
to 
gain 
momentum for the team and 
spend as little time in our zone 
as 
possible,” 
said 
assistant 
coach Kris Mayotte, who has 
been handed the reins for the 
Michigan penalty kill.
As 
the 
mindset 
on 
all 
penalty killing should be, the 
Wolverines hope to achieve 
success with a man down in 

a different fashion than last 
year — adding aggressiveness 
to their defending. During the 
exhibition, 
Michigan 
didn’t 
allow the Lancers to get many 
open looks, constantly putting 
pressure on their passing game 
up top. As Windsor players 
passed the puck back and forth 
to each other, all four Wolverines 
on the penalty kill would find 
a player to put pressure on, 
creating high turnover rates in 
the defensive zone.
“I thought that we did a good 
job of limiting their options 
like our D-core was talking 
about, it just didn’t seem like 
they had good 
opportunities 
to 
set 
up,” 
said 
senior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin. 
“And 
then 
once they did, 
I 
thought 
we 
had done a good 
job 
with 
our 
sticks, and body 
positioning.”
And even before the puck 
entered 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
zone, the pressure was already 
on.
Whenever 
they 
can, 
the 
Wolverines apply pressure by 
forechecking on the penalty kill.
“It puts us in a good position to 
potentially end their plays before 
they even get into our zone,” 
Martin said.
When the opposition gets 
into the offensive zone, Martin 
believes it would take a “good 
puck-moving power play unit” 
to break down their penalty kill. 
But with the amount of on-puck 
pressure given, moving the puck 
would be a tall task.
The new-look penalty kill is 
heavily dependent on all four 
skaters and the goaltender being 
on the same page. If only one 
skater pushes forward, the effort 

goes to waste, as the player being 
pressured can move the puck to 
an open teammate.
But the team is responding 
well to the new system and being 
in-sync, learning when one goes, 
all go.
“I think when we’re working 
in tandem,” Martin said, “it can’t 
just be one guy going, three guys 
watching.
“... Every time we do it and go 
through it we’re looking better.”
And the strength of the team 
in the system isn’t just the unity 
in its aggression, but also the 
sense of understanding and ease 
of learning. Mayotte pointed out 
that in a game, 
there 
will 
be 
moments 
few 
and far between 
that 
will 
go 
exactly as drawn 
up. 
“You’re going 
to get different 
looks that you 
don’t 
practice 
against,” 
Mayotte 
said. 
“It’s a much more fluid situation. 
Rather than we know how to kill 
against structure and things like 
that. It’s more of the hockey side 
of just playing when things don’t 
go perfectly.”
The 
team 
saw 
moments 
throughout the penalty kills 
where bounces went in favor 
of Windsor. But the ability to 
improvise and work around 
broken 
plays 
allowed 
the 
Wolverines to successfully kill 
off any chances at the net. And 
when the opportunity arose, 
they pushed.
“Because once that happens, 
then the execution becomes 
pretty seamless,” Mayotte said. 
“Even if it doesn’t feel right, or 
even if they do it right, they want 
to make sure it is done the right 
way, not just getting the result 
they wanted.”

W

hen I first started applying to colleges, 
I was often amazed by the number 
of choices available at every school. 
There were so many majors, so many classes, so 
many student organizations — the world seemed 
to be my oyster. Michigan seemed to dominate 
in this realm, and I came to school here for this 
very reason. However, it wasn’t just the sheer size 
of their programs; it was the fact that U-M was 
nationally ranked in seemingly every single one of 
them. They also had schools dedicated to special 
topics, such as the School of Information, whose 
classes usually would be tucked into a computer 
science major at another school.
Although I knew I wanted a good combination 
of quantitative and qualitative elements — some 
math and some writing — I hadn’t settled on an 
exact field of study. I was a young student in the 
College of Literature, Science and the Arts, and 
I was comforted by its offering of 85 majors and 
more than 100 minors. There were also 14 other 
schools within Michigan that I could apply to, 
and with Michigan having strengths in both the 
sciences and humanities, there didn’t seem to be 
a bad option.
However, this freedom of choice was just an 
illusion once put to the test. I soon realized that 
taking one class meant I couldn’t take another, and 
that going down one major path meant I blocked 
off a different route. Each of those 14 schools had 
prerequisite classes I had to take before I could 
apply. Even though I would’ve only applied to 
maybe three of them, that still meant at least three 
prerequisite classes for each school. There was no 
way I could fit those in my schedule, while also 
fulfilling distribution requirements, and still be 
on track to graduate on time. 
Given I was constrained with a “budget” of only 
18 credits (about four classes) a semester, I had to 
figure out which classes within those 18 credits 
offered me the best balance of enjoyment, workload 
and need. I soon had to learn which classes I could 
afford to give up in order to take another, more 
interesting class. I couldn’t have my cake and eat 
it too; I had to make trade-offs between choices, 
and hopefully make the choice that gave me the 
greatest benefit.
For example, math eventually became a situation 
where the skills I gained paled in comparison to the 
suffering it caused. I didn’t really have an interest 

in taking math beyond upper-level calculus. When 
I first started, math offered me enough benefit (I 
could then major in Economics or other majors 
with math as a prerequisite) that it was worth the 
present sacrifice. However, at a certain point, the 
pain from taking math classes vastly outweighed 
the potential benefit that the cost outweighed the 
gain — the equivalent of negative marginal utility 

in economics. Thus, I closed myself off to any 
potential math majors, as well as statistics. 
I also learned that I had no desire to write papers 
all day, as I had originally thought when writing 
my college applications. I wanted to be a historian 
or a diplomat when I was in high school, but after 
recognizing I would never learn another language 
— I had taken 14 years of Spanish classes without 
achieving fluency — I closed these paths off as well. 
My original wealth of options was getting smaller 
and smaller by the day, and the joy I felt in having 

so many choices turned to anxiety.
All this time, my intended major was staring 
me straight in the face, but I refused to recognize 
it. The mental calculations I kept making, the 
realizations I had, all pointed straight down the 
path of economics. I was already thinking like an 
economist with the daily internal machinations I 
conducted, and it was only a natural step to devote 
most of my coursework to it. 
I could also say it was destiny; my mother and 
sister were both economics majors (the latter at 
Michigan), and I grew up being quite familiar 
with terms like marginal cost, utility and 
scarcity. But, in economics parlance, the choice 
to follow my mother and sister’s footsteps also 
maximized the utility I received from picking a 
major. 
There would be a substantial math component, 
but also a chance to do plenty of writing, building 
both my analysis and data handling skills. While 
I wouldn’t learn another language, I would get 
to see how different countries interact in the 
international economy, and how their cultures 
affect their relationship with the rest of the 
world. I would get to learn plenty of history, but 
also mix it with a lot of data. In short, I would get 
the real-world application with the knowledge of 
theory I craved. 
Majoring in an LSA department also gave 
me the chance to have that full liberal arts 
experience I desired when I was in high school. 
I’ve had the chance to analyze paintings in my 
French art history class, read articles about what 
it means to be an empire, take (another) semester 
of Spanish, and experience my first real coding 
class. Because the economics major requires 
fewer credits than many of the other majors I 
considered, I also have the chance to enhance my 
degree with a minor. In the course of fulfilling 
distributions, I might also get the chance to study 
abroad, and therefore travel outside North America 
for the first time. 
In a field of study defined by making tough 
decisions between two options, majoring in 
economics at the expense of something else 
ironically didn’t create a trade-off for me. I could — 
despite the strict bounds of rational choice — have 
all the things I wanted in my college experience, 
and even get to explore all those choices which 
initially bedeviled me.

fter my high school graduation, I worked part-
time as a Jimmy John’s sandwich artist. The 
title “artist” was always funny to me, as if 
cleaning up mayonnaise and throwing a slab of glistening 
roast beef onto a roll was a craft to be perfected. 
I would rarely be put on the cash register because of 
my social awkwardness, but one day my boss suggested I 
try it during the lunch rush to practice talking to custom-
ers. An older man came in near the end of the rush and 
paid for his $8 sandwich with a $10 and a $5 bill. I gave 
him his five-dollar bill back, thinking it was an accident, 
and he immediately became upset.
“Do you millennials not know how to do math any-
more? Fifteen minus eight is seven. Give me seven back.” 
He was in a full suit with a briefcase and was likely 
returning to his big-shot, nine-to-five job after eating his 
freaky-fast sandwich. I gave him seven dollars without 
a word.
After he finished eating his #9 Italian Night Club 
— salami, capicola, cheese, onions, lettuce, oil and vin-
egar, in that order — I cleaned his table and read the sign 
posted on the wall next to it. It was titled “How Much Is 
Enough?” and featured a short story about a fisherman in 
Mexico who meets an investment banker from the Unit-
ed States. The banker, who had an MBA from Harvard, 
scoffed at the simplicity of the fisherman’s life and sug-
gested he go into business selling fish and invest in bigger 
boats, which would require him to move to a big city and 
would earn him millions in 15 to 20 years.
“Then what?” the fisherman asked. The banker 
responded that he could retire to a small fishing town 
and live a simple life.
And thus marked the beginning of my quarter-life cri-
sis.

A few weeks after leav-
ing my job at Jimmy 
John’s, I started school at 
the University of Michi-
gan. I chose to major in 
creative writing and com-
munications, two of the 
stereotypical “unemploy-
able” majors, despite my 
high school teachers tell-
ing me to pursue math to 
make life easier for myself.
I was thrown into a cul-
ture that placed STEM 
and business fields above 
everything else. Most stu-
dents had hobbies on the 
side, but the general con-
sensus seemed to be “make 
the most money you can, 
however you can, so you 
can do your hobbies later.”
I was recently served 
an ad on Facebook for the 
U-M Fall Job & Internship 
Fair with a caption that 
read, “Hey #UMichStudents, landing your internship or 
first job out of college can be an awesome feeling. But in 
order to land one, you have to make your job search a top 
priority while you’re in school. Here’s your chance to do 
that.”
I could imagine the person writing this on the U-M 
social media team sitting in their office, looking at the 
clock to count how many more hours they had until 5 
p.m., writing anything that came into their head. I know 
because I’ve been that person; I worked at an advertising 
agency after my freshman year making Facebook ads for 
car dealerships. And the summer after that, I did public 
relations for a health insurance company.
I attributed my dislike for the agency to the fact I had 
previously worked for a non-profit and just wasn’t used to 
the new type of work, but working for corporate America 
also sucked the soul out of me. By the end of my intern-
ship at the insurance company, I knew I never wanted to 
work in those environments again. No one was passion-
ate about doing good for the world, only making money 
and getting praise from their bosses. The offices were 
gray with harsh lighting that highlighted the bags under 
the employees’ eyes. 
I could see a cycle happening in front of my own eyes. 
Send out the Facebook ads, make a bunch of money for 
old white men who don’t need it, use that money to make 
more ads. Write a blog post about self-care, publish it on 
the insurance company’s Facebook, make people think 
they care and buy more insurance. Wash, rinse, repeat.
When I saw this U-M Facebook ad, I was reminded of 
all of the networking events I’ve gone to out of obliga-
tion and left out of anxiety. I went to my first career fair 
during my junior year, though I didn’t recognize any of 

the companies. There was an ambiguous air about every 
table; even the tables I went up to couldn’t quite articu-
late what they did and why it mattered. The representa-
tives just talked at me for 20 minutes until I accepted 
their business card.
The last table I went to was Yelp. I waited in line for 
over half an hour after at least three business students 
cut in front of me.
When I reached the front of the line, the representa-
tive raised his eyebrows. “We have mostly sales posi-
tions, which means facing rejection a lot. Do you think 
you would be emotionally prepared for that?” he asked. 
The man’s face had the same robotic, condescending look 
in his eyes as the man who asked me if I knew how to 
give change in Jimmy John’s. The only real information 
he gave me was how much money he’s made in his posi-
tion. He then told me to apply online, of course, as every-
one does.
I walked out after his spiel. I passed at least 40 more 
students coming into the fair on my way out, each dressed 
the same with that man’s exact look in their eyes. They 
were ready to become robots with his same program-
ming.
We live in an environment that creates gatekeepers 
for success. Either you pursue a field that makes you feel 
inferior, or you’re convinced you should sacrifice yourself 
to a company for the slight possibility of being happy. But 
I want to be a writer, which means I probably will never 
be “rich and successful” like my math teacher or a career 
fair representative would like me to be. In fact, I’m going 
to be the naïve kid they would make fun of for “following 
her dreams” into an unnecessarily difficult life.
But if I’m going to be working for the rest of my life, 
why would I spend my energy fueling the same system 
that makes it impossible to be satisfied?
Upon reflection, it’s clear the Harvard businessman 
is the antagonist of the “How Much Is Enough?” story. 
The fisherman knew what he was doing. Instead of sac-
rificing his sanity for a career that would bring him right 
to where he already is, he made a life for himself doing 
what brought him joy. It was that simple. He didn’t have 
to wait until retirement to fish, the same way I won’t have 
to wait until retirement to write.
Ironically, next to “How Much Is Enough?” there 
was another sign in Jimmy John’s. It read, “If you do the 
things you need to do when you need to do them, then some-
day you can do the things you want to do when you want to 
do them.” 
I want to make an edit to this sign. Instead of separat-
ing “need” and “want,” I would say to do the things you 
want to do because you need to do them. Whether you’re 
a writer, an artist or a sandwich artist, cultivate love for 
your work. Listen to what comes easy to you. Figure out 
how to use the things you love to help yourself and the 
world. 
And please, whatever you do, don’t assume sandwich 
shop cashiers can’t do math. They probably know a lot 
more than you think.

I 

hunt for my Jordanian guilty pleasure in Meijer as my 
roommate looks for the Cholula.
Of course, it’s not here. 
Every morning, Baba gave me a cornucopia of foods 
that aren’t typically consumed for breakfast. From ramen 
noodles, to oreos, carrots, to halloumi (the Arab equivalent 
of feta), Baba tried it all on me. Finally, one day he gave me 
“halawa,” a tahini treat that is surely 90 percent sugar. I 
devoured my portion every morning without giving it my 
usual second health-nut thought. 
Nope, not here. I keep looking as if I’m going to magically 
find it hidden behind 10 cans of chickpeas. It’s been a 
year since my semester in Jordan, and I really could use a 
reminder of what it was like to consume my interpretive 
breakfast every morning with Baba, peacefully watching the 
news and encouraging me to eat his carrots. Unfortunately, 
the “international foods” aisle has a way of confining the 
world to an empty shelf of chickpeas. Halawa isn’t even that 
exotic! At least it hadn’t been in Jordan. Looks like Margot 
finally found the hot sauce, promptly ending my moment of 
nostalgia.
My dad always told me I had a chip on my shoulder. It was 
probably a combination of the lingering baby fat, remedial 
English classes and feeling like I never fit in. Being French 
meant that I got weird looks whenever my mom addressed 
me in a public space. It meant I didn’t get the cool snacks 
that all my classmates had. It meant I never understood the 
joke because I wasn’t adept enough at American culture, 
despite having lived in the United States my whole life. 
Ironically, these were all blessings. What I failed to 
understand as a child was the invaluable exposure I 
received, and the privilege I had in my ability to claim more 
than one identity. As a child though, it felt like I had no 
sense of belonging. The chips on my shoulder would gnaw 
at my brain like a faulty pipe constantly dripping, but my 
mother told me I needed to find a way to move forward. I 
might’ve taken her too seriously because I started walking. 
I envisioned going step by step, the movement inspiring 
some sort of emotion, and it stuck.
Now, four years later and in the Michigan fall, I ask 
myself for the hundredth time why I chose to attend college 
in a state that doesn’t believe in springtime. Why walk to 
class when you can ice skate instead, right? No, Mathilde … 
not right. You hate this. I’d usually be listening to Michael 
Barbaro, my daily news informant, but I opt for a phone 
call with Mom instead. She recently watched a video about 
how French words carry different meanings depending on 
whether they’re masculine or feminine, and she brings up 
a word that piques my interest. Péripatéticien. Good god I 
can’t even pronounce that right. A pedagogue to the core, 
she instructs me on its masculine etymology, thoroughly 
unpacking this Aristotelian term.
“So, it’s just someone who walks?” I ask.
“Well, no Mathilde, it’s a man who wanders purposefully.” 
What is a purposeful wanderer? 

“You know … someone who walks back and forth 
contemplating 
various 
philosophical 
questions, 
like 
Aristotle and his followers did.”
“Donc, Je suis une péripatéticienne!” “So, I am a 
péripatéticienne.” I had almost forgotten the original 
conversation.
My mom bursts into laughter, eager to share her newfound 
knowledge. Naturally, a female wanderer who walks back 
and forth on the street proposes a different connotation. 
But, by the looks of my empty wallet and clumsy winter 
movements, I am veritably not a prostitute. Interesting. I 
wonder if the same can be said for Arabic. I wonder if this 
is how the Jordanian men perceived me when I had the 
audacity to do the exact same thing that they were.
W

hile the risk-averse State Department lectured 
my class on the penalties for marijuana usage, 
I visualized the potential feasibility of walking 
home. I was only two days into my semester in Jordan, 
and I was motivated to do something distinctive for my 
individuality, such as walking. Maybe this can be my alibi for 
skipping the gym. What felt like the perfect plan revealed to 
be the perfect storm, but Mike from the State Department 
was almost done with his monologue and I was too easily 
distracted by the recurring “What’s next?” mindset to give 
the idea of walking home much consideration. 
I traveled to Jordan after studying Arabic for three years, 
unsatisfied by my dose of cultural exposure and veritably 
hungry for more. I was set on walking. So, while my friends 
went to the gym, I resolved that I’d walk home with my best 
friend Stephanie. She conveniently lived two blocks away 
from my homestay. It worked out well because Baba adored 
Steph and felt more comfortable with my pilgrimages 
knowing that we’d keep an eye out for each other.
If Steph was my right-hand man in Jordan, Baba was my 
left-hand man. My homestay father can be characterized 
by three things: the news, his jokes and the constant smoke 
permeating the square mile around him. A retired doctor 
for the Saudi royal family, Baba is an incredible man whose 
life is filled with as much laughter as coughing. He fed me 
more in one night than my grandmother, Petite Mam, had 
in 10 years and he loved me as much as my real dad does. 
Besides Stephanie, Baba grounded me. I walked through the 
door every day, only to see his sheer ecstasy in seeing that 
I arrived home. His unbridled smile was juxtaposed with 
my plastered one: mine being prompted by relief and often 
subdued by the trials of the past hour.
I 

often wonder how Baba is doing now that I’m back. 
I’ve sent him a couple of messages, but I haven’t gotten 
a reply. I try to put the worst thought out of mind, but 
it inevitably boomerangs right back. This daily meditation is 
clearly doing wonders. I can’t help but speculate if he “found 
out” about me. Does he know what my wardrobe actually 
looks like? Has he figured out that I drink alcohol? As long 
as he doesn’t discover how much happier I am now that I’m 
home, I don’t care what he finds out. Am I happier? God, I 

don’t even know. Whatever. Baba always preached about my 
one-way ticket to Hell anyway. He often joked about how I 
embodied his favorite Nestle three-in-one: a liar, selfish and 
crazy! That was an inside joke between him, Steph and me. 
It didn’t make much sense beyond the fact that he loved to 
tease whoever was around. He could never say that without 
busting a quick smile; he loved me so much, and I really 
loved him too. I still do. I’m sure he’s just boycotting the 
computer, not me. Right?
W

alking in Jordan kicked my adrenaline into 
gear. I often found myself side by side with 
the cars on the street while navigating my way 
through a country that didn’t value walking as much as my 
impetuous self did. Sometimes it was the massive plants 
that were clumsily placed dead center on the sidewalk, 
preventing me from walking without feeling like I was 
going through the jungle. Other times, I preferred hedging 
my bets against the cars rather than the men frequenting 
the cumbersome sidewalks. 
During my first time walking home, Steph and I had 
eaten a particularly heavy lunch that only Baba would’ve 
been proud of. In an attempt to compensate for the extra 
falafel, we opted to walk home. It was pouring rain, and 
mashallah (God willing) there must’ve been something in 
those chickpeas, because we could not stop laughing. In 
retrospect, the rain served as a shield, repelling all the men 
who would otherwise be on their usual prowl under the hot 
mid-sun day. 
In that moment though, Steph and I reveled in our 
fantasy. We were in a country where hospitality and 
generosity were paramount and rambunctious Arab family 
gatherings guided our social lives; the thrill of the culture 
shock was as deafening as rapturous, especially with Baba 
embodying Mr. Congeniality. Soon enough, I’d be laughing 
and coughing just as much as him.
A pattern developed. I met Steph in the morning to take 
our usual cab ride to the building across from the British 
embassy. We’d fight with the cab driver about the price 
when he assumed we were impressionable foreigners, and 
oftentimes repel any advances he would make.
“So, where are you beautiful girls from?” he’d ask.
“Funny you should ask! We are part of an all-girls 
Canadian band going on tour,” I’d say. 
“Do you need a guide while you’re in Amman?”
“No, thanks!”
“Can I get your phone number, habibti?”
“No”
“Are you looking for a husband? Your eyes are 
mesmerizing”
Hell. “No.”
Steph and I would laugh uncomfortably the whole time. 
What else were we supposed to do in that situation? As 
foreign women in a man’s country, we couldn’t overstep. He 
drove the car. He was in control.
Every day after classes ended, Steph and I would meet 

to embark on our odyssey. The journey wore us down as 
the months progressed, but I refused to give it up. I had 
made a decision that I would walk every day, and like hell, 
I wouldn’t let my privileged discomfort stop me. In fact, 
I thrive on spite! I wanted to prove to myself that I was 
strong, that feeling weak out of vulnerability did not make 
me so, and that walking was my means of proving it.
I gazed at the gorgeous mansions that left my mouth 
gaping, and then my eyes would wander to those of the 
armed men fantasizing about what could penetrate my 
unguarded wonder and gaping mouth. They repressed 
everything but their true souls, which were given away by 
the looks in their eyes. Could I say anything to them? No. 
They were pious men. I watched them pray with their guns 
still on their shoulders during lunch every day, so I knew 
this for a fact. They wouldn’t prey on me, not really. But 
if you could see what was in their eyes. If only you could 
understand that looking into their eyes meant inviting 
yourself into their fantasy of undressing you. 
I didn’t feel it physically, but in some ways, I felt it 
harder mentally. These men were armed with AK-47s. 
They wouldn’t do anything, but they could if they wanted. 
Powerless. I felt powerless. It was fucking scary. The roles 
had reversed since my first day of walking, and these men 
had exchanged my fantasy in the rain for their own erotic 
deviancy. It distressed me to feel no agency, to have no sense 
of control or ability to make them stop. Stop. Howling like an 
animal internally, but keeping to myself externally.
I stopped looking at houses and kept my head down. 
I didn’t see the wonder, but I didn’t feel the pain either. I 
put one foot in front of the other and moved forward. They 
wouldn’t prevent me from walking because I wouldn’t 
give them the satisfaction of submission. I felt like I was 
undertaking a task of revolutionary cause, when in reality 
I fed their fantasies, adding myself to their repertoire of 
imagination and entertaining their repressed dreams.
N

ow, I trudge through the snow in Ann Arbor, 
looking for safe places to step. I stroll through the 
Diag contemplating what I need to accomplish 
for the day, and incorporate ludicrous dance moves into my 
walk. I don’t even give it a second thought. I don’t mind the 
people around me, and I don’t feel insecure about who I am. 
I wear what I want; I eat what I want; and alhamdulillah 
(thank God) I no longer have a 10 p.m. curfew at the age of 
21. 
But I still don’t feel in control or at ease. All the 
materialistic things I thought gave me agency just masked 
the assumption that I had authority over my life. I’m clearly 
quite impressionable. I’ve confused autonomy for equality 
and this mirage has recently been shattered. It’s easy to 
blend in when everyone looks like you. How does a hijabi feel 
walking around Ann Arbor? Does she get stared at as much 
as I did in Amman? How does she find a way to maintain her 
autonomy in a community of Western conformity?

y mid-March, Steph and I knew the drill. We 
marched through the streets, stomping through 
the roundabouts and heedlessly injecting 
ourselves into the traffic. The cars surrounded us like in 
the movies, but it was exciting. The masochist in me lived 
for the thrill of potential danger. I liked going straight 
into that lion’s den. Maybe my amygdala is defective. 
The increasing normalcy of my life was comforting too. 
Our classes were invigorating and purposeful; I knew 
what I was doing in Jordan and I found solace in that. 
Studying the refugee crisis was characteristically heavy 
material, but walking gave me the ability to navigate 
through all that mental traffic. What omnipotent power 
had blessed me with privilege? Baba would say God. My 
dad would say karma. I’m jealous of their certainty; I 
can’t relate to that feeling. 
Steph was worrying about her future as a doctor as 
I savored in the uncertainty of what would be next. 
I would figure it out. Hopefully ... The fear of failure 
wouldn’t hit for months to come, when I’d start feeling 
the withdrawal symptoms of being aimless. What’s the 
point of walking if you don’t know what direction you’re 
going? I had a path in Amman. I knew the path like the 
back of my hand. I didn’t like unrequited attention, but I 
tolerated it. Women are gifted at tolerating things they 
shouldn’t.
It became so much easier once our routine integrated 
the men’s harassment. I was scared but I didn’t 
understand why. I knew they wouldn’t lay a hand on me, 
but I still felt unsettled at the idea that I relied on their 
mercy for my safety. And that’s not only indicative of 
Jordan; that’s a woman’s reality. Their flagrant gazes tore 
down the neatly arranged curtain that had been hung up 

in front of me my whole life.
I had spent my adolescence impulsively walking 
through Chicago at night, and I didn’t want that taken 
away from me. Safety precautions notoriously tarnish 
anything fun. Walking in Amman had me questioning my 
pedestrian experiences in Chicago. Maybe I just didn’t 
notice the unwanted ogling. Maybe, I was oblivious. 
Nonetheless, my routine in Amman fostered comfort, 
and with comfort came the desire to push the edge. Steph 
and I found our own means of staging mini coups. What 
better way to repel men than to dress more provocatively? 
We thought we were so clever. We were not. 
I say provocative like I wore mesh and ripped jeans, 
but provocative meant that I was wearing white, an 
ironically innocent color. Provocative meant that you 
could visualize my form as a woman. Provocative meant 
that my shoulders were covered but my arms weren’t; my 
legs were covered and my shirt was loose. 
Then one day, Steph got pissed. There had been a 
group of men who were around our age, acting seemingly 
harmless as usual. But they started following us, so we 
went into a store to throw them off. One of them clearly 
didn’t appreciate our defiance and went into the store 
with us. He followed us around and laughed at our fear. 
What do we do? We left the store and he emerged, right 
behind us. We tried going faster but still, he was there. 
Caught between my fight or flight instincts, I could hear 
my mom telling me I should act like the graceful woman 
she had raised me to be, and I could hear my muscles 
laughing at my delusion. Eventually, his friends made 
him back off and he disappeared. Thank God, because I 
could feel myself riding the line of cultural insensitivity, 
screaming crudely in the middle of the street. 

We were fine. Of course. Steph and I always were. I 
always was. I was blessed enough that my recklessness 
never cost me my safety, and my risks had always paid off. 
But that was a risk Steph wasn’t willing to take anymore. 
So, I started walking alone. I couldn’t help but wonder 
when the day would come that I wouldn’t be so lucky as 
to have my imprudence be rewarded with the luxury of 
immunity.
M

aybe I can find my halawa on Amazon. Will 
that make me happier? I thought that coming 
home would be liberating, but I feel stuck. I 
can’t seem to find motivation or purpose. What the hell 
am I doing? I learned and experienced so much, only to 
come back to Ann Arbor and sit on my couch, doing the 
exact same things I did before my semester abroad. 
I’m more of an outsider here than I was with Baba 
and Steph. I embodied my identity better when I was 
disguised as the good Christian girl Baba craved me 
to be. She doesn’t have tattoos. She doesn’t expose her 
shoulders. She’s a virgin. They knew a utopian version 
of me. Well, utopian for them. That version of myself 
felt pretty dystopic in my nightly water-filled eyes, but it 
somehow felt more real. Contradicting, right? Maybe it 
was the sense of purpose. I’m scared to lose myself, but I 
can’t even resolve which version of myself I’m hoping to 
keep. I don’t know what I want. What if I don’t figure it 
out? Seventeen dollars for a pound of sugar-free halawa. 
I want it.

I 

woke up to the sound of rain. It was late August 
and the air had a coolness to it. I looked at the 
clock and saw it was 7 a.m., unusually early for me. 
But it didn’t matter, because today was a special day. I 
needed to prepare. I stretched from underneath my blan-
kets, still warm from a good night’s rest, and stared up at 
the popcorn ceiling of my tiny blue room. The old dolls 
on top of my wardrobe were smiling at me as if they were 
also aware of the day’s importance. 
I slid out from under the covers and the hair on my 
legs stood up. My bare feet hit the cold floorboards and a 
creak rang throughout the silent house. The baby wasn’t 
awake yet, I gathered, and I wanted to keep it that way. 
My baby cousin (who was living with us on account of my 
aunt having a nervous breakdown and fleeing to Europe) 
was staying in my room with me. I tiptoed to her and 
smiled at the peaceful, tiny person laying in my old baby 
cradle. I asked my mom why my aunt didn’t take her to 
Europe with her. She said my aunt could hardly take care 
of herself, let alone a child. 
I lived in the countryside, near mountains and for-
ests, but we were really just a hop away from Louisville. 
Usually, my mornings smelt like bonfire smoke from the 
neighbor’s yard along with the familiar air that could 
only be described as the scent of your own home. Now 
that my baby cousin was here, my room smelt more like 
baby powder. 
I rubbed her head and slowly leapt across the creaky 
floorboards, straight into the hallway. My head ached a 
little, but I was sure it was just the weather. Sometimes 

my head ached when I was worried, but I had no reason 
to be worried. Not today. 
I was convinced this day was going to be the best day of 
my life. Though in truth, my life had only consisted of 10 
years so far. Not much had happened to me yet. I walked 
into the living room to see my father snoring on one side 
of the sectional and my two groggy dogs beginning to 
wake on the other. I quietly shuffled to the window and 
looked at the rain. It was definitely stopping soon. 
I wondered when he would come over. 
I could hear the floorboards creak and the washing 
machine buzzing. The house was waking up. My momma 
walked into the living room with a pot of coffee in one 
hand and my baby cousin in the other. She gave me a kiss 
on the forehead and sat next to my dad, who was now sit-
ting up and shaking off the sleep. My parents both had 
those accents. My dad’s sounded like tobacco and my 
mom’s was like sweet tea. Neither me or any of my sib-
lings had them like my parents did. And in the morning 
when they teased each other awake, their accents were 
thick. 
“Oh, you made coffee already? That’s my job!” my dad 
sang as he heaved himself up off the couch and into the 
kitchen where the fresh pot of coffee awaited him. 
“I was going to let you sleep in,” my mother shouted 
after him despite the fact a whisper could’ve been heard 
between our thin walls. My sister could be on the oppo-
site end of the house, whispering something as quietly 
as she possibly could, and I would still make out almost 
every word. I knew this because we used to play this 
game to pass the time, back when my aunt was staying 
with us. Before she fled to Europe. We always had to play 
quiet games when Aunt Autumn was around, as to not 
“evoke her headaches.” 
“Are you excited for today, Eve?” My mother pulled me 
down to sit beside her. She knew all about my plans. 
“Yes! I am! He told me he’d come over as soon as he’s 
up, but he won’t come if it’s raining.” 
“How come? He’s walked over in the rain plenty of 
times!” 
“I know, but he told me kings can’t get wet on their 
coronation day or else it’s bad luck.” 
“Well, the good news is it’s not supposed to rain for the 
rest of the day!” My dad came back in the room, sipping 
on his coffee. He sat right beside me, smooshing me in 
between my mom and him, “That Gavin boy is a quirky 
one, isn’t he?” 
“Dad,” I nudged him over a little, “He’s not quirky! 
He’s creative!” 
“Quirky isn’t a bad thing! Some of the best people in 
the world, you could say, are quirky.” 
“I know, but the boys at school call him names like 
that.” 
“What? Quirky?” My mother sat her coffee down as my 
baby cousin squirmed in her arms. 
“I mean mostly they call him crazy. Or creepy.” 
“Boys can be mean sometimes, can’t they?” my mother 
said.
“Don’t you go letting any boys call you names, now, you 
hear? I don’t want to have to deal with any …” My father 
chimed in.
“Oh, Todd, what would you do about it? Are you gonna 
go and fight some 11-year-old boys?” 
“I mean I don’t want to, but if I HAD to …” 
“I won’t let boys call me names, Daddy. I won’t let any-

one call me anything! Queens don’t stand for that kind of 
nonsense!” I proclaimed, beaming. 
My father cheered, “That’s my girl!” 
My mother lay her head on my shoulder for a moment 
and giggled. There were mean kids at school who thought 
of me as “different,” too. Quirky, perhaps. But even at 10 
years old, I knew I could tell my parents I was a queen 
and they would send me off to my coronation with love. 
And a bologna sandwich. 
“I’ll make one for Gavin, too, OK?” It was about eight 
o’clock now. My father was doing yard work and my 
mother was packing me snacks to take on my big adven-
ture, “He likes bologna, right?” 
“I’m sure he does.” 
“I’m so glad some kids finally moved into the area. And 
one with an imagination like yours!” 
Suddenly there was a knock at the front door. My dogs 
began to bark. 
“I’ll get it!” I gasped, running towards the door. I 
pushed the dogs back and cracked the door open just 
enough so he could squeeze through. There he was. My 
partner in crime. He was long and thin as a stick, and he 
hunched a little like he wasn’t sure what he was growing 
into yet. He was wearing a black t-shirt with the sleeves 
rolled up and blue jeans cuffed at the ends. His typical 
attire. He was a bit too “Grease lightning” for the Vine-
yard Vines kids we went to school with, but I liked him 
that way. As always, he entered my home rather silently, 
but my mother knew I had let him in because the dogs 
stopped barking. 
“Hello, Gavin!” She came around the corner holding a 
Kroger bag filled with snacks. 
“Hello, ma’am. How’s your morning been?” His lanky 
arms swung a bit as he spoke. 
“Very good, thank you,” my mother smiled. She liked 
how Gavin was so polite. I also think she felt a little bad 
for him. I didn’t know exactly why. 
“Mom can we go now?” I took the Kroger bag and 
stuffed it in my backpack filled with miscellaneous 
objects — mason jars, a compass and keys that had lost 
their locks long ago.
“OK, but be home in a couple hours!” 
“Coronations take a long time.” 
“It’s OK. I gotta be home by two. I’ll get her back here,” 
Gavin grabbed my arm and I got goosebumps. The kind 
of goosebumps that at 10 years old feel comforting and 
electric. Definitely not cold. 
“Bye, Mom. I love you!” 
“Bye, be safe!” 
I slammed the door shut and squealed, “It’s coronation 
day!” 
Gavin laughed. We ran across the street into the neigh-
bor’s yard and around back until we were in the woods. 
We made our way towards the creek’s edge, skipping 
stones and listening to the sound of birds chirping and 
leaves rustling. The sun was shining through the tree 
limbs and Gavin and I were trampling over rocks and 
twigs. I was abundantly happy. My headache was dying 
down.
