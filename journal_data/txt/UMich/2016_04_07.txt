Sexual misconduct 

regulations now 
include gender-
based harassment

By RIYAH BASHA and CAMY 

METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporters

The University of Michigan 

released the full text of its 
revised 
sexual 
misconduct 

policy 
on 
Wednesday 
after 

a 
nearly 
year-long 
revision 

process, cementing an array 
of previously reported policy 
changes, including an expansion 
of what is considered prohibited 
conduct, 
adjustments 
to 

the 
enforced 
definition 
of 

consent and the consolidation 
of 
sanctioning 
and 
appeals 

procedures. 

The new policy is nearly 

double the length of the current 
document, and the first update 
since 2013. Much of the text of 
the document is significantly 
more stringent and includes 

in-line definitions of terms and 
the investigation process, unlike 
the current one. The new policy 
will go into effect June 1, and 
will now be known as the the 
University of Michigan Policy 
and Procedures on Student 
Sexual 
and 
Gender-based 

Misconduct and Other Forms of 
Interpersonal Violence.

In a March interview with 

the Daily, University President 
Mark Schlissel said the lengthy 
revision 
process, 
which 

included 
various 
town-hall-

style meetings to gain student 
input and a sexual misconduct 
survey administered in January 
2015, was necessary to address 
student concerns.

“We have been working hard 

for many months to update our 
policies and procedures to make 
them more clear, to keep them 
as fair as possible and to create 
a process that renders a timely 
decision so people can move 
forward in safety and their 
educations,” he said.

Take Back the 

Night hosts event 
to promote sharing 

stories

By MADELEINE GERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
38th 
annual 
Take 

Back the Night rally in Ann 
Arbor drew students, faculty 

and community members to 
the gathering downtown on 
Wednesday.

Since its founding in 1877 in 

response to fear and violence 
experienced 
by 
women 
in 

England, the Take Back the 
Night movement has spread 
internationally, 
aiming 
to 

promote 
a 
safe 
space 
for 

survivors to share their stories 
in a supportive community. The 
annual marches aim to raise 
awareness about and stand up to 

sexual violence.

University Students Against 

Rape and the Ann Arbor chapter 
of Michigan Take Back the 
Night sponsored the Ann Arbor 
march and rally, with funding 
and support provided by Central 
Student Government.

Ann Arbor residents Tom and 

Pam Swider have been leading 
Ann Arbor’s chapter of Take 
Back the Night for the past eight 
years. They both said they feel 
a strong commitment to the 

cause, noting that they work 
continuously 
throughout 
the 

year to prepare for the rally and 
march.

Pam Swider introduced the 

event, saying the intention of 
Take Back the Night is to start a 
dialogue about violence.

“This event is a way to start 

a conversation about something 
no one wants to talk about,” she 
said. “Most importantly, we are 
here to give survivors a voice and 

Rally aims to increase local 
awareness of sexual assault

Students and 

faculty gather to 
talk initiatives, 
plans for future

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

This week, students, faculty 

members and alumni from 
around the world celebrated 
the University of Michigan 
School of Nursing’s 125th year 
anniversary comprised of a 
series of events and lectures as 
part of a three day symposium 
on global health.

Tuesday, the first day of 

the 
event, 
was 
primarily 

dedicated 
to 
student 
and 

faculty research projects as 
part of the nationwide Annual 
Research Day. Held at the 
Sheraton Ann Arbor Hotel, 50 
students and Nursing faculty 
members displayed posters on 
their research. Professors both 
at the University, as well as 
nationwide, also gave lectures.

At the beginning of the 

conference, 
Nursing 
Dean 

Kathleen Potempa announced 
a gift of $1 million recently 
awarded to the School of 
Nursing 
from 
the 
Robert 

and Sara Rothschild family 
foundation. 
This 
donation, 

made by Sara Rothschild, a 
Nursing alum, will work to 
create the Rothschild Global 
Health Scholars Program at 
the University and continue 
to encourage global health 
initiatives through the School 
of Nursing. This program, 
along with others at the School 
of Nursing, aim to provide 
resources for students to work 
worldwide with faculty and 
other partners.

In 
a 
speech 
at 
the 

symposium, Potempa discussed 
her 
appreciation 
for 
the 

Rothschild gift and emphasized 
the importance of the funding 
inpromoting and furthering 
global health at the University’s 
School of Nursing.

“We’re talking a lot about 

philanthropy 
today 
and 

its 
tremendous 
effect 
on 

global health,” Potempa told

Daily Staff Reporter

Wednesday in the Michigan 

League, the Office of the Vice 
Provost of Equity, Inclusion and 

Academic Affairs, along with a 
variety of other groups, hosted a 
symposium on First-generation 
college students.

Ann Hower, director of the 

Office of New Student Programs, 
said the goal of the event was to 
help first-generation students feel 
comfortable in the environment 
of the University of Michigan 
and aid them in them succeeding 
academically and socially.

“The end goal is to help (first-

generation students) thrive on 

campus and successfully meet all 
of their academic and social goals 
and make sure the system is set up 
to accommodate these students,” 
she said.

The event, which opened to a 

turnout of nearly 150 students, 
a little more than half of whom 
were 
undergraduate 
students, 

facilitated a series of smaller group 
workshops that aimed to address 
how 
first-generation 
students

High-rise would 
replace Lucky 

Kitchen, Mia Za’s and 

Pita Pit

By LYDIA BARRY

Daily Staff Reporter

Contractors of a new 14-story 

high-rise near the University of 
Michigan campus have submitted 
an updated site plan for a residential 
building 
designed 
for 
future 

students and faculty within the 
coming years. The building would 
replace three residential homes, as 
well as restaurants Lucky Kitchen, 
Mia Za’s Italian Cafe and Pita Pit, 
all of whom have agreed to sell their 
properties.

The full list of performers and 

events for the Unviersity of Michigan’s 
SpringFest were released Wednesday, 
including Canadian rapper SonReal 
and a slate of Detroit-focused 
programming.

The fifth annual SpringFest, 

hosted by MUSIC Matters, will take 
place Wednesday, April 13th. The day-
long festival aims to encompass all 
things Michigan, with activities on the 
Diag and an evening charity concert 
featuring hip-hop group Migos. 

During the day, activities such 

as a fashion show, a Michigan spin 

on the hit TV show “Shark Tank,” 
Greek life-led philanthropy efforts, 
a showcase of student startups and 
more will be set up along the Diag 
and North University Ave. The event’s 
themes include innovation, arts, 
sustainability, social identity and 
community service on campus, as well 
as recognition of student leaders.

SonReal will perform across from 

Kraus on North University Ave. during 
the day. Students will also have the 
opportunity to paint a piano which 
will be donated to a school in Flint or 
Detroit.

The festival will also include food 

trucks along the Diag from places 
such as Detroit BBQ Company and 
Bearclaw Coffee. In keeping with 
the event’s sustainability efforts, the 
trucks will be a completely waste-free.

SpringFest’s main event — the 

Migos concert — will begin at 8 p.m. 
at Hill Auditorium. Proceeds from 
it will go towards Music Matters’ 
proposed summer leadership camp for 
underprivileged Detroit youth, which 
is slated to launch in 2017. Tickets for 
the concert start at $10 for students 
and $20 for the public.

WHEN YOUR BRACKET IS DONEZO. puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Under the revised policy, 

the 
University’s 
Office 

of 
Institutional 
Equity 
is 

tasked with investigating not 
only 
instances 
of 
reported 

sexual 
misconduct 
cases 
— 

whichnumbered 172 in 2015 — 
but also incidents of reported 
stalking, 
intimate 
partner 

violence 
and 
gender-based 

harassment.

The policy’s definition of 

gender-based 
harassment 

outlines 
actionable 
cases 

as ones relating to “actual 
or perceived gender, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, or 
gender expression.” OIE will 
investigate any conduct that 
creates a “hostile environment” 
for the claimant, even if the act 
is not sexual in nature. Stalking 
and intimate policy violence 
were previously included in the 
policy as prohibited activities, 
but 
will 
now 
be 
separate 

categories.

Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, 

director of the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center, 
said 
in 
a 
March 

interview with the Daily that 
the expansion was necessary 
to 
ensure 
the 
University’s 

compliance 
with 
federal 

regulations including the Clery 
Act and Title IX.

“Our (goal) … is to be as 

inclusive as possible of the kind 
of misconduct that we see as 
being related to these issues, as 
well as respond to federal and 
other emerging guidance,” she 
said.

Because of the expansion 

of 
the 
policy 
to 
include 

gender-based 
harassment 

and 
interpersonal 
violence 

in addition to sexual assault 
and 
harassment, 
University 

administrators have said they 
expect to see an increase in 
the number of Title IX cases 
reported and investigated.

In January, OIE’s annual 

sexual 
misconduct 
report 

showed a 33-percent increase 
in the number of misconduct 
reports from 2014 to 2015, while 
the number of cases investigated 
by OIE remained the same. Of 
the 172 cases received by OIE 
in 2015, 29 were investigated, 
66 were referred to the Review 

Panel and 78 did not fall within 
the scope of the policy.

Detailed 
definitions 
of 

consent, incapacitation and 
coercion

The updated policy outlines 

a 
more 
comprehensive 

definition 
of 
consent 
and 

provides students with a clearer 
expectation 
surrounding 
its 

meaning. While much of the 
language remains the same in 
both versions, the new policy 
clarifies 
certain 
ambiguities 

in the current guidelines that 
only explain consent as a “clear 
and unambiguous agreement.” 
The new revisions elaborate 
on the definition of non-verbal 
consent, stressing that it is “not 
to be inferred from silence, 
passivity, or lack of resistance,” 
and noting that non-verbal cues 
“may not be sufficient” to gain 
consent.

It also encourages students 

to gain affirmative consent, 
stating that not only must 
consent be given, but that it 
also must be actively sought, 
noting that the individual who 
initiates a specific sexual act 
“is responsible for obtaining 
Consent for that activity,” and 

emphasizing 
expectations 

regarding accountability.

A 2015 Michigan Daily 

report 
on 
one 
student’s 

experience 
with 
the 

University’s 
sexual 

misconduct 
policy 
found 

several discrepancies between 
SAPAC’s definition of consent 
— which encourages verbal, 
affirmative consent — and 
the 
University’s 
enforced 

definition of consent under 
the current policy. The new 
policy’s definition of consent 
addresses 
many 
of 
those 

discrepancies.

In addition to consent, the 

new policy further explains the 
definition of incapacitation, 
providing 
students 
with 

clearer-cut 
questions 
to 

determine whether someone 
meets the criteria. At an 
October 
roundtable 
hosted 

by 
the 
SAPAC, 
students 

voiced concern about policy 
definitions surrounding both 
consent and incapacitation, 
emphasizing the ambiguity of 
such words.

The revised policy states 

that the University evaluates 
incapacitation cases by asking 
if the person initiating sexual 
activity was aware that the other 
individual was incapacitated and 
if “a sober, reasonable person, in 
the same situation” would been 
able to determine if the other 
individual was incapacitated. If 
yes is the answer to either one of 
the above questions, the policy 
says there was no consent and 
there was most likely a policy 
violation.

While the current policy 

already says consent cannot 
be obtained through force, the 
new definition also specifically 
bars individuals from initiating 
sexual 
activity 
through 

coercion, or triggering fear in 
another person.

Increased 
disclosure 
of 

witness identities and sexual 
history

Another new addition in the 

updated policy includes a clause 
allowing the consideration of 
“Prior or Subsequent Conduct 
of the Respondent” and “Prior 
Sexual 
Contact 
Between 

Claimant 
and 
Respondent” 

during investigations.

The policy document clarifies 

that this information would 
never be used as evidence or to 
evaluate character, but would 
instead 
serve 
to 
determine 

pattern and intent of an incident. 
According to the policy, the 
knowledge would be used in a 
limited number of cases if the 
information would “help the 
Investigator 
understand 
the 

manner and nature of sexual 
communication 
between 
the 

two persons.”

LSA senior Laura Meyer, 

volunteer 
co-coordinator 
for 

the Networking, Publicity and 
Activism Program at SAPAC, 
expressed concern about this 
practice in a recent interview. 
She said such policies stem from 
a larger, underlying issue of how 
consent is defined.

“What I would really like 

to see is a verbal standard,” 
Meyer said on consent. “Not 
one that relies on trying to 
understand body language but 
something that relies on verbal, 
enthusiastic, affirmative, sober, 
coercion-free consent.”

The new policy also requires 

witness names to be disclosed 

to 
both 
parties 
during 
an 

investigation, 
which 
Meyer 

also cited as a concern, saying it 
could potentially be a negative 
for some groups on campus.

“We know from the campus 

climate 
survey 
of 
sexual 

misconduct that people in close-
knit communities on campus are 
more likely to experience sexual 
misconduct, and so I think that 
the identification of witnesses is 
potentially a negative for those 
communities,” Meyer said.

She noted that other schools 

have 
implemented 
similar 

policies with the aim of making 
the process fairer, and said she 
hopes the University evaluate 
the success of the effect of the 
new clause.

The updated policy states 

that the University will review 
the policy as a whole each 
year, 
making 
appropriate 

modifications as needed.

Restructuring of sanctions 

and appeals process

The new policy completely 

restructures 
the 
process 
of 

sanctioning respondents found 
to be in violation of the policy. 
Currently, a sole representative 
from the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution determines 
sanctions, with the aim of 
preventing 
instances 
of 
the 

prohibited conduct in the future 
and correcting negative effects.

Under the new policy, OSCR 

will still facilitate the new 
process but its role will change to 
overseeing a separate sanctioning 
board composed of two faculty 
or staff representatives selected 
by the vice president of student 
life and the University president, 
as well as a student chosen by 
Central Student Government.

The 
addition 
of 
a 
CSG 

appointee 
was 
debated 
at 

multiple SAPAC roundtable talks 
in discussing policy revisions, 
with some students expressing 
concerns that a representative 
appointed by CSG would not 
be representative of the entire 
student body.

In an interview Wednesday, 

CSG 
president-elect 
David 

Schafer, a LSA junior, said he 
appreciated including a student 
presence in the process and 
believes it is a step toward 
greater transparency.

“Going 
forward, 
there 

must be a continued focus 
on 
transparency 
and 

accountability throughout this 
process,” Schafer said. “Micah 
(Griggs) and I look forward to 
working with all of the involved 
stakeholders.”

The new policy does not 

delineate whether the student 
representative will be a member 
of CSG or the student body at 
large, which Schafer said was a 
concern.

“While I believe that students 

must definitely be represented 
on the Sanctioning Board, I 
believe the clause referencing 
CSG 
involvement 
must, 
in 

greater 
detail, 
specify 
the 

process by which the student 
representative will be chosen,” 
he said.

A 
third 
change 
to 
the 

sanctioning 
process 
impacts 

the procedure for appeals once 
sanctions 
are 
given. 
Under 

the new policy, if either the 
respondent or claimant takes 
issue with the sanctions or 
findings, 
they 
may 
appeal 

decisions to an external, third-
party reviewer. The current 
process directs appeals to an 
Appeals Board, which consists 
of one student appointed by the 
Central Student Government, 
one faculty member appointed 
by the Faculty Senate, and one 
administrator appointed by the 
University President.

The impartial reviewer in 

the new policy will be chosen 
by the office of the general 
counsel in consultation with 
the vice president for student 
life. The general counsel and 
vice president for student life 
are currently Tim Lynch and E. 
Royster Harper, respectively.

“The 
External 
Reviewer 

will be a neutral party, most 
often an attorney outside of the 
University with significant legal 
experience, 
knowledge, 
and 

judgment,” the policy reads.

In 
a 
March 
interview, 

Schlissel 
acknowledged 
that 

implementing 
the 
policy 

will 
require 
education 
and 

awareness efforts on campus, 
but said he hopes to engage the 
entire University community to 
create reform on the issue.

“Our 
overarching 
goal 
is 

to make campus as safe as 
possible,” he said.

attendees. 
“The 
Rothschild 

Global Health Scholars will help 
us expand our global programs 
for students, both undergraduate 
and graduate, who intend to build 
their careers to work-study and 
research in places around the 
world.”

Among the most significant of 

the symposium events included 
a Wednesday talk by keynote 
speaker Vanessa Kerry, CEO and 
co-founder of the Seed Global 
Health Service Partnership and 
daughter of U.S. Secretary of 
State John Kerry.

Her speech, titled “Promoting 

Workforce 
Development: 
The 

Importance 
of 
Nurses 
and 

Midwives,” focused on Seed, 
which 
deploys 
U.S. 
health 

professionals 
to 
strengthen 

health care and provide health 
service to countries with limited 
access worldwide.

Kerry also discussed what 

she described as an inequitable 
worldwide 
distribution 
of 

health care, geographic shifts in 
health care workers and faculty 
shortages in health care leading 
to limited nurse training — tying 
them all to the importance of 
innovation in spreading nursing 
throughout the globe.

“The idea is simple,” she told 

attendees. “We’re called Seed 
Global Health because we’re 
planting seeds through education, 
with the idea that if you plant one 
seed, you are going to get a force 
of educators that will continue 
to plant and grow and cultivate a 
new generation.”

Nursing senior Emily Boltey 

attended the event and had 
a poster in Tuesday’s event 
showcasing her work on breast 
cancer. She said she especially 
enjoyed Kerry’s talk about the 
Seed organization and creating 
global health partnerships.

“It’s been really nice how 

they’ve emphasized the role 
of nursing in global health 
since nursing is such a large 
workforce,” Boltey said. “I really 
like how (Kerry) emphasized 
the importance of increasing the 
partnership between physicians 
and nurses.”

Overall, Kerry stressed the 

need for global initiatives in 
health care to improve the 
educational 
opportunities 
for 

nurses and the availability of care 
for those in countries with less 
accessible medical practices, an 
idea reiterated frequently in the 
following student and faculty 
lectures.

Ellen Lavoie Smith, director 

of the School of Nursing Ph.D. 
program, said the event was 
important in promoting nursing 
as a global initiative, especially 
with regard to the expansive 
network of students who have 
graduated 
from 
the 
School 

of 
Nursing 
and 
have 
used 

their education to encourage 
worldwide health initiatives.

“It’s really exciting for me to 

be able to think about how does 
this all apply to the kinds of 
things that I’m interested in and 
my research program,” Smith 
said. “And how can I, in turn, 
encourage my students that I 
mentor one-on-one but also the 
students in the program as a 
whole to be able to think about 
global opportunities.” 

Clinical 
Associate 
Prof. 

Stephen Strobbe, winner of the 
symposium’s 
faculty 
poster 

award for his research within 
the Washtenaw Health Initiative 
opioid project, echoed Smith’s 
sentiments and said the event 
increases 
recognition 
about 

health concerns being both local 
and global. 

“We have a number of shared 

priorities around the globe, and 
this is one way for us to be able to 
share information, interventions, 
successes and to collaborate and 

work together to address these 
global problems and to improve 
global health,” Strobbe said. 
“Happily, the University School of 
Nursing has been on the leading 
edge of global health responses 
and this is another example of our 
collaborative efforts.”

Nursing senior Asa Smith, 

who had a poster in Tuesday’s 
event showcasing his research on 
HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, said 
he enjoyed presenting his work 
because it allowed him to gain 
research experience and will help 
him narrow down his focus for a 
Ph.D. program.

“From my perspective, it’s a 

really great opportunity to work 
on research projects, put together 
a poster and really own a part of 
research and really take that into 
your own hands,” Smith said. 
“I’m looking to just see about 
learning some more information 
about the global aspects. It’s just 
good to keep cognizant about 
global issues from a nursing 
perspective.”

Nursing alumni and former 

roommates Lori Prentice and 
Shirley Dunbar, both of whom 
graduated from the School of 
Nursing in 1957, also attended the 
events Tuesday and Wednesday 
and said they were particularly 
interested in the growth of the 
field. Prentice said she wants to 
see the field of nursing expand 
and contribute more to the global 
experience.

“It makes me smile and 

broadens my mind about what’s 
going on in nursing,” Prentice 
said. “There are always sick 
people, and there are always 
needs. If there’s always needs, 
there’s always nursing of some 
sort. When I graduated 60 years 
ago, we didn’t have this global 
experience.”

The 
event 
will 
continue 

through Thursday morning and 
early afternoon, with further 
discussions and lectures related 
to global health.

Michigan. 

“It’s not enough to provide 

access to first-generation students,” 
said Dilip Das, assistant vice 
provost for academic affairs.“We 
have to provide an opportunity 
for them and other disadvantaged 
students to flourish in the same 
way advantaged students expect to 
flourish when they come here.”

At one workshop, Dwight Lang, 

a faculty adviser to first-generation 
students, 
said 
first-generation 

students are at the highest risk of 
dropping out.

“I always worry about those kids 

in the fall,” Lang said. “If they don’t 
feel connected to the university 
quickly, they are at risk of leaving.”

In 
another 
workshop, 
Rod 

Freidhoff, Engineering Advising 

Center Director, noted that a 
prevalent theme was show to better 
involve faculty in the process of 
creating an environment where 
these students can thrive.

“Do we ever see students 

paralyzed by the number of choices 
presented to them?” he asked.

This 
idea 
of 
mentorship 

continued to be a recurring theme 
throughout the day. Many speakers 
agreed mentorship was the best 
and most practical way to integrate 
disadvantaged students into the 
University, 
saying 
mentoring 

could give these students a sense 
of belonging in such a competitive 
environment.

Deborah 
Greene, 
University 

public affairs and media relations 
representative, said during the 
event she thought professors taking 
interest in these students is key to 
the students’ experiences.

“When a professor begins to take 

interest in first-generation students 

they begin to think, ‘I didn’t know 
anyone was really willing to invest 
time and care in me,’ ” she said.

In addition to the workshops, 

many 
University 
organizations 

came to the event to show students 
how to get involved on campus. Pilot 
— a program offering leadership 
and development opportunities to 
students in struggling communities 
around Michigan — was one such 
organization, and Pilot member 
Dakotah Feil, an Engineering 
sophomore, said the group is 
excited to welcome all first-
generation students who want to 
get involved.

“The majority of our members 

are 
first-generation 
students, 

and we do a lot of work with 
underrepresented 
students 
on 

campus, so we’re really looking for 
new members,” she said. “We’re 
just looking for passionate people.”

apartment 
complexes 
near 

campus, the building is planned 
to feature a study lounge, fitness 
room, sky lounge and outdoor sky 
terrace. Similar to other apartment 
buildings 
such 
as 
ArborBlu, 

Landmark and Zaragon, it will 
have 
micro-apartments, 
studio 

and multi-bedroom units available 
for rent with prices ranging from 
$900 to $4,770. There will also be 
53 off-street parking spaces, as well 
as a Zipcar, which will be offered to 
residents according to the updated 
site plan. Additional bedrooms were 
also proposed in the updated site, 
bringing the total to 343 beds.

The space, located at 611 E. 

University Ave., next to Zaragon 
Place Apartments, is proposed 
to have entrances on both East 
University Avenue and on Church 
Street according to the updated 
site plan. The site was originally 
multiple properties on both East 
University Avenue and Church 
Street, but will be combined into 
one property should the plan be 
approved by the city of Ann Arbor.

City Planner Alexis DiLeo said 

she sees this project as one of 

several that will remove properties 
and redevelop the area, instead of 
the more common development of 
green underdeveloped spaces.

“This proposal, as well as most of 

the recent development throughout 
the city, would indicate that the city 
is no longer just being developed 
and is now being redeveloped,” 
DiLeo said. “Redevelopment often 
takes people by surprise. Most 
expect that a vacant lot will be 
developed some day, but they do not 
often anticipate an existing one- or 
two-story building, or a house, will 
be demolished to make way for a 
larger development.”

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 

(D–Ward 2) said he understands the 
reasoning behind another student 
high-rise being built on campus.

“From my standpoint, I’d sure 

rather folks be able to live near 
where they need to go rather than 
drive there,” Westphal said. “If 
there still is in fact a healthy market 
for this type of housing, most people 
I speak with agree that close to 
campus is the best place for it.”

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Design 

Review Board, which consists 
of 
two 
landscape 
architects, 

two architects, one planner, one 
developer 
and 
one 
contractor, 

reviewed the site in February and 

offered feedback to the developers. 
Their main reservations of the 
proposal were the excess private 
vehicle entrance space as well as the 
consistency between this building 
and the local area.

“The proposed development is 

not consistent with the tower tops 
of the block or the South University 
character area,” a statement from 
the board reads. “The South 
University area has the greatest 
concentration 
of 
pedestrians 

anywhere in the city, their comfort, 
safety and needs must be prioritized 
over private parking.”

There have also been some public 

concerns about the rapid pace of 
neighborhood growth in Ann Arbor 
in general over the past few years, 
but Westphal said he believes that 
the public will see this location is 
the best option.

“In general, the public has said 

over and over that they believe 
downtown is the best place for high-
density residential and commercial 
buildings, so in terms of the scale 
of the project, it fits with what the 
public expects,” Westphal said. 
“Of course Ann Arbor’s landscape 
has changed downtown quite a 
bit in the past decade, so there is 
certainly concern about the pace of 
that change.”

give them a chance to celebrate 
their journey to recovery.”

SafeHouse 
advocate 
and 

survivor Quinn Davis shared 
her story as the featured keynote 
speech of the night. Davis said 
she studied abroad and worked 
with 
children 
in 
Thailand 

while coming to terms with the 
aftermath of rape.

“I was only a surrogate for the 

rape,” Davis said. “I am too busy 
nurturing myself to nurture a 
toxin I did not create and never 
wanted.”

Davis said she was first able 

to begin the process of moving 
forward by turning to dance. 
She said while she has made 
progress in the long battle of 
moving forward, every day she 
is still reminded of the assault.

“After the rape, dance was 

one of the only things that felt 
mostly unchanged,” she said. “It 
reminded me that my body is for 
me. It went from something that 
I did to something that I had to 
do.”

Volunteer 
psychological 

counselors, 
who 
were 

identifiable by white arm bands, 
were available throughout the 
march to those who needed 
them. Some also wore teal 
arm bands and were available 
for attendants who wanted to 
identify as survivors and seek 
counseling.

Ann Arbor resident Tom 

Swider introduced the demands 
of the Take Back the Night 
supporters, which included “No 
means no” and “We demand 
safety everywhere.”

“We gather tonight to demand 

recognition that sexual violence 

is in our communities and unite 
to take a stand against the cycle 
of violence,” he said.

Before the initial speechs, 

local 
singer 
Ashley 
Franso, 

student-run 
dance 
team 

Cadence and various University 
of 
Michigan 
clubs 
and 

organizations worked at tables 
to provide information about 
their respective missions as 
well as resources they provide. 
Participating 
organizations 

included the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center, the Spectrum Center, 
Body Peace Corps, the African 
American 490 Challenge and 
Free Hearts, among others.

LSA freshman Kalei Glozier, 

a member of Spectrum Center’s 
community engagement team, 
said his organization decided to 
table because of the importance 
of 
including 
the 
LGBTQ 

community in the conversation 
around sexual assault.

“Rape 
does 
happen 
in 

the 
LGBT 
community, 
and 

sometimes it is taken as not as 
important, 
especially 
among 

gay men,” Glozier said. “We 
wanted to promote safe sex and 
consent.”

Margie 
Pillsbury, 
head 

officer of the University Police’s 
Special Victims Unit, gave a 
speech 
about 
the 
founding 

of her unit and the role it has 
with addressing and providing 
resources on campus regarding 
sexual violence.

“In 
2015, 
the 
University 

created the Special Victims Unit 
because we realized that sexual 
assault and personal crimes are 
not like other types of crimes 
that police investigate,” she said. 
“When a person who you know 
and trust violates your body by 
assaulting you or raping you, it is 

not so easy to just call the police 
and make a report.”

She said the goal of the unit 

is to investigate sexual assaults, 
domestic 
violence, 
stalking 

and child abuse, adding that 
she hopes her team’s work will 
make a difference concerning 
prevention and support.

“We want to make things 

easier for survivors so they 
have the options they need and 
deserve,” she added. “We want 
to change the culture and be the 
change agent.”

Take Back the Night student 

leader Audrey Parenti, an LSA 
senior, became involved in the 
event after attending the rally 
her freshman year. Parenti said 
sexual violence is a pressing 
issue on campus that needs to be 
addressed.

“I think there is a lot more that 

needs to be done,” Parenti said.

After 
the 
speeches 
and 

statements of demands, members 
of the audience grabbed posters, 
signs and balloons in preparation 
for the march portion of the 
event, which commenced outside 
of the Michigan Union. Students 
and 
community 
members 

gathered and chanted in unison, 
chanting “two, four, six, eight! No 
more violence, no more rape!”

LSA senior Naoshin Khan, 

co-president of an anti-human 
trafficking 
club 
on 
campus 

known 
as 
FreeHearts, 
said 

events such as Take Back the 
Night are important as sexual 
assault and abuse is an issue that 
is not receiving enough attention 
at the University.

“I feel like sexual violence is 

not talked about on campus,” 
Khan said. “It is the duty of the 
University to increase awareness 
and take actions on preventing 
future crimes from occurring.”

4A — Thursday, April 7, 2016

Whenever my sister and I visit 

my uncle, we can always be sure 
to hear him say “So how is Snobby-
ville?” By “Snobby-ville,” my uncle 
is referring to Ann Arbor, and, 
more specifically, the University of 
Michigan campus.

My sister and I, being the first 

people in my family to attend this 
institution, are often subjected to 
this kind of anti-U of M talk. For 
the most part, it’s because of sports 
— my cousins who went to MSU 
will tease us whenever Michigan 
loses a game. It’s not anything that 
any student with family members 
from opposing universities hasn’t 
gone through, but for some reason, 
I can’t help but to see some depth 
to 
my 
uncles 
“Snobby-ville” 

jokes. Of course it’s not the most 
sophisticated of quips (my uncle is 
not a comedian) but it highlights 
some of the underlying opinions 
that many people hold towards 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 

Mainly, that the students here are 
mostly conceited and annoyingly 
privileged.

I grew up in a town where 

attending this university is a big deal. 
To the average citizen of a rural town 
in northern Michigan, where the 
biggest industries are agriculture and 
tourism, somehow managing to go to 
the same institution that a former 
president attended is monumental. 
Out of my graduating class of about 
90 students, a whole five students 
attend this University — a number 
to celebrate in my hometown. 

Suddenly, it’s like we were a part 
of this elite, privileged class made 
up of the people who were lucky 
enough to attend the University of 
Michigan.

My experience on this campus has 

been quite different. The feelings of 
exclusivity and specialness ended 
almost immediately after arriving 
on campus. It’s not that anyone 
explicitly tried to make me feel 
left out, but hearing my classmates 
talk about the connections their 
family had and the experiences 
and opportunities they had been 
afforded made me realize that, for 
the first time in my life, I was part of 
a lower, less wealthy class. I started 
to see myself as some redneck from 
a hick town who, only managed to 
get here on a fluke.

Incidents like the taping of 

University student Jake Croman 
yelling at an Uber driver and the 
destruction of the Treetops resort 
last winter have only further 
increased my feeling of loneliness. 
As someone who has worked in 
the service industry I could easily 
identify with the Uber driver or 
the workers at the resort, but to 
the rest of the world I was a part of 
the elites who often harassed the 
working staff. The fact that I was 
here partly on a scholarship and 
partly on my dad’s life insurance 
exacerbated 
this 
feeling 
of 

loneliness and unworthiness.

I’m not the only one who feels 

this way. Other students I’ve 
met from lower socioeconomic 

backgrounds have spoken about 
feeling like an outsider here. 
Part of it might be that students 
from similar backgrounds like 
mine are so few and far between 
here on campus that I get excited 
whenever I meet one. I don’t see 
this 
necessarily 
changing, 
as 

the 2010 University of Michigan 
Student 
Profile 
reported 
that 

nearly half of in state freshmen 
come from families that earn more 
than $150,000 a year. This isn’t 
necessarily a bad thing if it weren’t 
paired with the fact that tuition 
to universities is skyrocketing. 
Attending 
high-profile, 
major 

universities is becoming more and 
more inaccessible to students from 
poorer backgrounds.

Getting a good education is key 

to social mobility, but without 
access to this education, social 
mobility stops. I firmly believe 
that 
universities 
should 
be 

affordable in order for a society to 
function. Making the University 
of 
Michigan 
more 
affordable 

wouldn’t make it any less snobby- 
we’re the leaders and the best, 
after all. But making education at 
this university more affordable 
might help this campus lose its 
overly respected reputation as a 
place for the elite, and gain the 
reputation as a place where voices 
from all backgrounds are heard 
and respected.

“Caring for myself is not self-

indulgence, it is self-preservation, and 
that is an act of political warfare.” 

–Audre Lorde
This month, I have taken up 

drawing. I spend hours sketching 
bodies, all of which resemble myself 
in one way or another. I have a 
process: 
Sketch, 
erase. 
Breathe. 

Sketch, erase. Breathe. Outline soft 
lead with silky black gel. Breathe. 
Pastels, purple on top of green. 
Smudge. Breathe. Smudge in white 
to make it lighter. Breathe. Smudge 
until rainbows envy the colors dyed 
upon my fingertips. Keep smudging 
until I forget to count my breaths.

When we talk about unhealthy 

relationships at the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center, 
we tend to solely speak about 
abuse in intimate relationships. 
Abuse is an all-encompassing word 
because it can define a variety 
of actions. At SAPAC, we define 
abuse in a multitude of ways. 
Abuse can be physical, sexual, 
emotional or financial, to name 
a few. An action is seen as abuse 
when a perpetrator instills tactics 
to gain disproportionate power or 
control over their victim — I have 
used the word victim here because 
not all survive from instances of 
intimate partner violence. Power 
dynamics and abuse within IPV 
are specific to each partnership. 
Abusive relationships are complex 
and reflect the perpetrator’s and 
victim’s social identities.

Presently, society still has a 

difficult time identifying IPV and 
its complexities. However, we are 
beginning to make progress labelling 
IPV, defining the nuances and 
identifying the signs. Identifying 
abusive romantic relationships is 
difficult, but the conversation is 
in motion. That said, something 
we rarely ever talk about, even at 
SAPAC, is abuse in non-romantic 
relationships. When abuse happens 
in 
non-romantic 
relationships, 

society rarely defines a perpetrator’s 
actions as abuse. Instead, these 
relationships may be seen as toxic 
or time-consuming. It is time we 
change the discourse around abuse 
in non-romantic relationships.

Oftentimes, 
society 
views 

abusive 
relationships 
between 

friends or families as “conflicts” 
rather than violence. The word 
“violence” implies the survivor 
has a loss of control. The word 
“violence” implies the survivor 
cannot escape. The word “violence” 
implies urgency. Yet, when a non-
romantic partner takes violent or 

abusive actions against a survivor, 
society often tells the survivor to 
work it out, apologize, let it go.

I am aware that people have off-

days. Sometimes a comment can 
be snide or an intended joke can be 
stated too harshly. I do not consider 
these actions abusive. Rather, I am 
speaking to tactics that a family 
member or friend constantly inflicts 
on survivors to gain control in a 
relationship. I am speaking about 
abusive behaviors that manifest into 
survivors’ daily lives. I am speaking 
about constant language survivors 
cannot escape, barriers that create 
isolation, threats that make them 
chain-lock their doors, physical 
attacks that bruises their skin or 
instances of sexualized violence 
that are not deemed serious. We 
need to start analyzing and defining 
these harmful tactics as abusive in 
both romantic and non-romantic 
relationships. We need to legitimize 
the helpless, distraught or fearful 
feelings that survivors may have in 
all forms of abusive relationships.

It is important to acknowledge that 

people have a variety of reasons for 
staying in unhealthy relationships. If 
people do not want to end unhealthy 
relationships, this is their choice. 
As a friend and ally, there are some 
important ways you can support 
a survivor of both IPV and non-
romantic relationship abuse:

1. Demonstrate to your friend 

what a healthy relationship looks 
like by providing unconditional love 
and support.

2. 
Listen 
and 
believe 
them. 

Validate their experiences.

3. If they ask for resources 

or alternate options for their 
situation, brainstorm some. Create 
lists together.

4. You can tell them, “I’ll be here for 

you if/when you are ready to leave this 
relationship,” but do not argue with 
them about what they need to do. This 
is their life. As their ally and friend, 
respect their ability to make choices. 

Most 
importantly, 
we 
must 

understand that all relationships 
are complex, and we must navigate 
them accordingly.

Recently, I have finally come to 

terms with identifying as being a 
target in an unhealthy relationship. 
As previously mentioned, this past 
semester I have taken up sketching. 
I do it on the days when her mental 
health controls my daily life. I do not 
blame her, but rather, I blame her 
unhealthy psychological state. For the 
past decade, I have spent much of my 
life trying to navigate an illness that 
doctors have yet to find treatment for.

In the past, I let her severe episodes 

control me. In the present, I am slowly 
learning how to take care of myself. 
I have come to terms with the fact 
that though this behavior is not her 
fault, it is also not my responsibility to 
constantly endure the attacks, threats 
and manipulation brought on by her 
psychological disorder.

Now, when an episode begins and 

a flood of texts pour in, instead of 
falling into a pit of despair as I used 
to, I have begun to sketch:

Pencil tracing paper, soft lead 

fading into coarse sheets.

You are worthless.
Black ink seeping into cracks of 

paper.

You don’t deserve happiness.
My breasts take on earthly hues, 

contrasted against my pink belly.

I don’t love you.
I am a goddess — strong and 

brilliant— if only on paper.

No one loves you.
Smudge the colors.
LEAVE ME ALONE.
Smudge them until my fingers bare 

vibrant, Aurora Borealis calluses.

YOU ARE WORTHLESS.
Keep smudging until her insults 

start to sound meaningless.

Through 
sharing 
my 

experience, I hope to convey 
the idea that we need to begin 
dialogues surrounding unhealthy, 
non-romantic 
relationships 

while 
expanding 
on 
dialogues 

surrounding 
abusive 
romantic 

relationships. The way I handle 
the relationship with her is unique 
to my personal circumstance. I do 
not think this should be everyone’s 
solution; however, I do think self-
care is an important practice for 
everyone to indulge in. Self-care 
allows us to avoid burn-out from 
our daily stressors.

When I first began my journey of 

self-care, I felt guilty about diverting 
my attention from someone I loved 
dearly, but I have recently begun to 
accept that, to sustain my being, I 
must take care of myself. I need to 
brush off the words, bandage the 
emotional wounds and practice 
constant forgiveness.

Sketching, along with talking to 

my family unit, is the best way I have 
learned how to handle the situation, 
if only for a moment.

For anyone who is struggling in 

an unhealthy relationship, whether 
it is intimate or non-romantic, please 
know that you are worthy.

Self-care is not an indulgence

ALEXIS BARKIN | OP-ED

FROM THE DAILY

Standards significantly raised 
T

The University of Michigan’s new sexual misconduct policy, 
now called the University of Michigan Policy and Procedures 
on Student Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct and Other 

Forms of Interpersonal Violence, is drastically more expansive than its 
2013 predecessor, and even its pre-released September 2015 draft. The 
policy gives the University more precise tools for determining what 
exactly sexual misconduct is in questionable circumstances, investigators 
the tools to convict perpetrators who may have slid by under the old 
policy and the campus community at large the tools to understand the 
intricacies of consent and incapacitation in nuanced situations. This new 
policy favors the claimant in numerous ways and will likely increase the 
number of assaults punished, thereby raising the standards around sexual 
activity and changing the culture around sexual assault on our campus. It 
also represents significant steps forward in several areas, but will require 
noticeable efforts by the University to align the rightfully strict standards 
in the policy with societal standards about gender and sex. 

In contrast to the previous policy, the 

new one clearly outlines the full process of 
reporting a sexual misconduct case to the 
University, uses gender-inclusive language 
and expands the scope of its definitions of 
consent and incapacitation. It also changes 
the role of witnesses and of the review panel 
and appeals process, as well as brings intimate 
partner violence and stalking underneath the 
scope of this singular policy and process.

The new policy is also vastly more 

transparent and organized about the process 
a student will embark on when they report 
a case of sexual misconduct. Significantly, 
it notes the distinction between the two 
different justice systems a student can report 
a case to: the University and/or the police. 
Though under the old policy, students were 
advised to report to the University’s Police 
Department in addition to filing a report 
to the University, the new policy explains 
that reporting to the police is a completely 
separate process than the one students will 
undergo at the University. Additionally, the 
policy offers resources — including specific 
phone numbers — for students to use to 
contact of variety of police forces.

While the Department of Education — which 

is currently investigating several Title IX 
complaints — and countless student activists 
believe the University has a responsibility to 
investigate and punish students for sexual 
misconduct, there is a national debate over 
whether universities are not equipped to 
investigate 
cases 
of 
sexual 
misconduct. 

Regardless of whether one believes the 
University should legislate these cases, the fact 
that the two processes are explained in a clear 
and detailed manner helps better educate our 
student body and aids in making options for 
students more clear.

Last April, the Daily brought to light the 

University’s inadequate definition of consent, 
noting it did not specify that silence and 
inaction did not equate to consent. The new 
policy specifically states, “Consent is not to 
be inferred from silence, passivity, or a lack 
of resistance,” also adding that “non-verbal 
communication” is not consent. This crucial 
change will raise the standard for consent. 
A respondent can no longer claim they had 
consent because the other party didn’t 
actively resist. Along similar lines, this new 
policy explicitly defines what constitutes 
coercion and force, both of which would 
render one unable to give consent.

Another 
significant 
change 
to 
the 

definition of consent is the clarification 
of who is held responsible for obtaining 
consent. Unlike the old policy, this new policy 
places direct responsibility on the party who 
“initiates a specific sexual activity” to obtain 
consent. This creates a distinction between 
respondent, initiator and claimant. This 
wording makes it explicitly clear that if the 
respondent, assuming they are the initiator, 
has failed to obtain consent, then that party 
will be found responsible. This seems likely 
to increase the number of respondents found 
responsible for misconduct.

The new policy also goes further to stress 

that a past sexual or dating relationship does 
not mean a person has automatic consent for 
current or future sexual activity, and that 
consent must be granted “each time (sexual 
activity occurs).” This is an important 
addition, as sexual assault in dating and 
romantic relationships does occur, and a 
previous relationship should not indicate 
that someone has consented for future sexual 
activity. To take this an additional step 
forward, the new policy unequivocally states 
that if a person withdraws consent (which 
can happen at any time) “sexual activity must 
cease immediately.” These additions protect 
the rights of all students engaging in sexual 
activity at all levels of engagement.

Rightly 
linked 
to 
the 
definition 
of 

consent in the new policy is the definition 
of 
“incapacitation,” 
which 
has 
been 

dramatically expanded upon. According to 
the new policy, a person is incapacitated if 
they are in “a state beyond drunkenness or 
intoxication” and cannot make “informed, 
rational 
judgements.” 
The 
policy 
also 

acknowledges 
that 
intoxication 
varies 

from person to person, depending on a 
multitude of factors including body weight, 
tolerance level and food consumption. By 
recognizing that each individual’s level of 
intoxication is unique and can fluctuate 
based on these reasons, the University is 
taking a commendable step to broaden the 
definition of intoxication so more claimants 
can correctly posit their incapacitation, 
and so all parties can accurately gauge of 
when someone is incapacitated. On that 
note, the new policy also explicitly reminds 
students of state amnesty laws on drinking 
and extends protection against University 
disciplinary actions to underage students 
who report instances of sexual misconduct 
while intoxicated.

The depth at which the new policy 

discusses how evidence is evaluated in the 
University’s response process is appreciated 
and will also have a measurable impact on 
the frequency that sexual misconduct is 
reported. Potential complainants now have 
the ability to review exactly how evidence 
gathered during the process will be collected 
and evaluated, as well as by whom, and all 
sides have the opportunity to understand 
how their conduct will be evaluated by an 
investigation. In addition, the appeals process 
now includes a review by an external party, 
preferably one with legal expertise. Given 
how much discussion currently goes into 
making the process fair for both sides, the 
option of the opinion of an external reviewer 
on both the evaluated facts, and the process 
should resolve most procedural inequities. 
Adding greater cross-campus equity, a 
student appointed by the Central Student 
Government will now sit on the board that 
will determine sanctions for students found 
guilty, adding to the process the student voice 
on these important issues.

Despite the heavy lifting this new policy 

does to raise the standards of sexual activity, 
there are steps in the process that are still 
questionable. Witnesses will now be required 
to be named to all parties in an investigation. 
While this new addition strives to make the 
process more equitable, we can’t help but be 
concerned that witnesses will be less likely 
to come forward if they know they must be 
named given that witnesses frequently have 
strong relationships with either side. The 
detailed processes in the new policy mostly 
balance the rights of the complainant and 
the rights of the respondent; however, we 
feel that there is more that could be done to 
protect witnesses, given the sensitivity of 
the issues at hand and the likely personal 
connection between witnesses and the 
students in question.

In many ways, this policy is the change 

students, student groups, administrators and 
a national public eye has been looking for. But 
it is also a double-edged sword. The standards 
this policy enforces will likely cause an 
increase in the number of respondents found 
responsible for misconduct, and that may 
cause students to experience a disconnect 
between the sexual standards they are 
taught in society versus the standards they 
are held to on our campus. However, though 
the disconnect may be large now, with the 
awareness this policy raises and educational 
opportunities posed, through enforcing this 
policy the University will be participating 
in one of many steps toward a better campus 
climate.

‘M’ blanks Bowling Green

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Less than 19 hours before the 

start of Wednesday’s game, the 
No. 17 Michigan baseball team 
suffered 
its 
largest 

defeat 
of 

2016, a 9-5 
loss to Notre Dame.

Yet 
on 
Wednesday, 
the 

Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 21-6 
overall) made Tuesday’s shortfall 
seem like ancient history as it 
topped 
Bowling 
Green, 
5-0. 

Wednesday was the sixth time this 
season they shut out an opponent.

“The beautiful thing about 

baseball is that each day is a new 
opportunity,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “If we were to 
dwell on anything that happened 
yesterday, it would just set us up 
negatively for today. Yesterday 
had nothing to do with today.”

Sophomore right-hander Ryan 

Nutof got the start for Michigan 
and pitched a gem, throwing five 
scoreless innings, giving up four 
hits, walking two batters and 
striking out four. Nutof’s record 
improved to 4-1 with the win.

“(Nutof) was in attack mode,” 

Bakich said. “He was getting 
strike one and strike two and was 
very efficient with his pitch count. 
To be able to put up five zeros on 
the board was exactly what we 
needed because the game was 
very much in question.”

The hero of Michigan’s offense 

Wednesday was sophomore first 
baseman Drew Lugbauer, who 
launched a solo home run over 
the right-field wall in the bottom 
of the second inning to put the 
Wolverines on the board. 

He later blasted a two-run 

homer to right in the seventh to put 
Michigan ahead, 5-0, and fell just 
short of knocking another one out 
of the park in the third when he hit 
a fly ball to the center field warning 
track.

“I’m just trying to do as much 

as I can do to help (the team), 
whatever I need to do,” Lugbauer 
said.

Bowling 
Green 
(2-4 
Mid-

American, 11-17 overall) threatened 
to score in the top of the fifth when 
it put runners on first and second 
with one out. After getting the next 
batter out, Nutof walked Falcons’ 
right fielder R.J. Williams to load 

the bases.

But Nutof got out of the jam 

when he got Bowling Green left 
fielder Matt Smith to fly out to 
Wolverines’ senior center fielder 
Cody Bruder.

“Having a team like ours 

behind me actually helps with my 
confidence,” Nutof said.

The score remained 1-0 until 

the bottom of the sixth, when 
sophomore third baseman Jake 
Bivens came to bat with a runner 
on third and two outs. Bivens 
proceeded to single to third base 
to drive in a run.

On the next at-bat, senior left 

fielder Matt Ramsay smacked a 
double to left field to score Bivens 
and extend Michigan’s lead to 
three. Ramsay then stole third 
base with junior designated hitter 
Carmen Benedetti up to bat to 
move within 90 feet of home plate.

But Benedetti couldn’t bring 

Ramsay home as he popped out to 
left field to end the inning.

Benedetti did, however, pitch 

1.2 innings of shutout relief, giving 
up one hit and two walks while 
striking out one in the process. 
He followed junior right-hander 
Keith Lehmann who pitched a 

scoreless sixth frame.

“It’s always nice to see (the 

bullpen) 
come 
in 
and 
stay 

connected as a team and as a staff,” 
Nutof said. “It creates momentum 
for us into our next games.”

The Falcons put up one more 

comeback effort in the top of the 
eighth when they put runners on 
first and second with two outs, 
which prompted Bakich to pull 
Benedetti in favor of sophomore 
right-hander Bryan Pall.

Pall got Bowling Green catcher 

Tyler Greiner to ground out to 
third to nip the Falcons’ rally in 
the bud.w

Junior right-hander Jackson 

Lamb came on to pitch a one-two-
three ninth inning to earn his 
second save of the year.

“Lamb is throwing downhill 

with his fastball,” Bakich said. 
“He looks really good. He looks 
confident, he looks composed. 
He’s attacking the zone.”

Wednesday’s victory improved 

the Wolverines’ 2016 record at 
Ray Fisher Stadium to 6-0. They 
will have more opportunities 
to add to their home win total 
when they begin a three-game set 
against Minnesota on Friday.

Lugbauer’s power 
on full display in 
Wolverines’ win

Sophomore homers 
twice to energize 

Michigan in

 5-0 wins

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

After watching Matt Ramsay’s 

three-homer 
game 
against 

Northwestern 
last 
Friday, 

sophomore first baseman Drew 
Lugbauer wanted to get in on the 
fun, too.

In 
Wednesday’s 
game 

against Bowling Green (2-4 
Mid-American, 11-18 overall), 
Lugbauer smacked two home 
runs over the right-field wall, a 
solo shot in the second inning 
and a two-run bomb in the sixth, 
to lead the Wolverines’ offense 
in their 5-0 victory. He finished 
the day with two homers in four 
at-bats, and three runs batted-
in.

“Seeing the guys get quality 

at-bats in front of me was nice 
insurance,” 
Lugbauer said. 
“That helped 
me out and 
got me going. 
Anytime 
someone does 
something like 
that it’s a good 
a reception (by 
the team).”

Added 

Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich: “He’s a guy 
who can change the game with 
one swing. He’s been doing a 
good job of keeping the ball in the 
middle and making loud contact 
these past few games. It was good 
to see Drew get some big hits for 
us. We certainly needed them.”

Tied 0-0 in the bottom of the 

second inning, Lugbauer’s first 
homer put Michigan ahead 1-0, a 
lead the Wolverines never gave up.

Up 3-0 in the sixth inning, 

Lugbauer hit a nearly identical 
shot to add to the cushion for 
Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 21-6).

Prior to the game, Lugbauer’s 

only dinger of the season came 
on an inside-the-park homer in 
Michigan’s March 19 game versus 
Oklahoma State.

He nearly hit a third against 

the Falcons, but was robbed at the 
warning track in center field in the 
third inning.

“(Ramsay) told me I was 

catching up to him,” Lugbauer 
said. “I didn’t think about it. I 
just thought about sticking to 
the approach and hitting the ball 
hard.”

All that junior lefty Ryan 

Nutof (4-1) needed to earn the 
victory was Lugbauer’s second 
inning blast. Nutof shutout the 
Falcons and allowed just four 
hits in five innings. Junior lefties 
Keith Lehmann and Carmen 
Benedetti, 
junior 
right-hander 

Jackson Lamb, and sophomore 
right-hander Bryan Pall combined 
to finish the final four innings. 
Collectively, they blanked Bowling 

Green and gave 
up only one hit.

Nutof 
was 

happy with the 
performance 
of the pitchers, 
and he spoke 
glowingly about 
how supportive 
the offense has 
been as of late.

“It’s 

awesome 

seeing guys like (Ramsay) and 
(Lugbauer) having multi-homer 
games,” Nutof said. “It’s so much 
fun and brings a lot of energy to 
the dugout.”

Fun and energy were welcome 

sights for Michigan one day after 
losing, 9-5, to Notre Dame. But 
whether the Wolverines can 
continue this energy without 
the help of multi-homer games 
remains to be seen.

Beilein on recruits:
“Just watch and see”

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan men’s basketball 

coach John Beilein could lose as 
many as three players from his 
2015-16 roster 
to 
transfers, 

and he’s facing 
the prospect of further attrition 
— not just among his players, 
but among his three assistant 
coaches.

Beilein 
acknowledged 

Wednesday that at least one 
of his assistants has received 
interest from other schools for 
their head coaching positions. 
The trio of Bacari Alexander, 
LaVall Jordan and Jeff Meyer 
has been with Beilein for the 
past six seasons.

Alexander, a Detroit native, is 

among the rumored candidates 
for the head coaching vacancy 
at Detroit. He played for the 
Titans 
during 
the 
1997-98 

and 
1998-99 
seasons 
after 

transferring 
from 
Robert 

Morris.

Alexander was in the mix 

for the job at Wisconsin-Green 
Bay last offseason; Meyer was 
reported at that time to be 
among those receiving interest 
from Liberty, where he served 
as head coach for 16 seasons and 
remains the winningest coach 
in school history; and Jordan 
was reported as a finalist for 
the job at Butler before the 
2013-14 campaign.

None of the opportunities 

have panned out — yet.

“There is some interest from 

some other universities, and 
I’m thrilled about it,” Beilein 
said. “I think that this is long 
overdue. They are really ready 
to be (head) coaches. The fact 
that we’ve been together for 
six years — that doesn’t happen 
very often.”

Beilein declined to confirm 

that 
Alexander 
interviewed 

with Detroit and didn’t say 
which 
other 
coaches 
have 

received interest, if any. There’s 
no short list of candidates 
to fill the potential vacancy, 
but Beilein said he doesn’t 
anticipate any issue filling the 
position should the need arise.

“I don’t want to lose any of 

them,” Beilein said. “But if they 
have the opportunity, I think 
it’s great.” 

BEILEIN 
TALKS 

RECRUITING 
CLASS: 

Barring the unforeseen, Derrick 
Walton Jr. is a lock to play the 
majority of minutes next season 
at point guard. But who backs 
him up remains in question, and 
hinges on whether senior Spike 
Albrecht returns for his fifth 
year of eligibility and whether 
incoming 
recruit 
Xavier 

Simpson proves ready for the 
rigors of the Big Ten.

“He plays the game the right 

way,” Beilein said of Simpson. 
“He’s an elite passer. … We’re 
counting on Xavier to come in 
and be one of those guys, because 
of his talent and the need for him 
to play right away. We hope he’s 
going to be ready to do that.”

Beilein also spoke briefly 

to the perception that his two 
incoming big men, 7-foot Jon 
Teske and 6-foot-10 Austin 
Davis, are longer-term projects 
who 
might 
not 
be 
ready 

to 
contribute 
during 
their 

freshman seasons.

“I would respond: Just watch 

and see what happens,” Beilein 
said.

Michigan is relatively set 

at the ‘5’ spot anyway, with 
rising junior forward Mark 
Donnal looking to keep his spot 
in the starting five and rising 
sophomore 
Moritz 
Wagner 

poised to make substantial 
jumps after an inconsistent but 
hugely 
promising 
freshman 

year.

CAMP SANDERSON NOT 

BEHIND HEALTH ISSUES: 
As 
injuries 
have 
piled 
up 

over the past several seasons, 
Beilein has at times discussed 
the prospect of reevaluating the 
Wolverines’ training routines 
and overall workloads in order 
to ensure fatigue and stress 
don’t contribute to missed time.

Even 
with 
senior 
Caris 

LeVert suffering his third lower 
leg injury in three seasons, 
Walton missing time for the 
second straight year, Albrecht 
missing the majority of the 
season with dual hip injuries 
and a smattering of other health 
issues plaguing the program, 
Beilein says strength coach 
Jon Sanderson’s famed “Camp 
Sanderson” summer workout 
programs 
don’t 
hurt 
— 
if 

anything, they help.

“They 
were 
all 
isolated 

injuries, and none of them 
were in the exact same area,” 
Beilein said. “It could just 
be coincidence that it’s all 
happened during this time.”

Moving forward, there are 

some preventative measures the 
team could take to gain a better 
understanding of who might be 
overworking themselves during 
practice.

“We’re looking into using 

workload-type 
of 
chips 
in 

our uniforms, in our shoes, 
to see what we can do,” 
Beilein said. “The times that 
we experimented with them 
this 
year, 
Derrick 
Walton 

was working at a completely 
different 
level 
than 
some 

of our other guys were. You 
don’t notice that — they’re all 
practicing, but one guy’s going 
a little harder than everybody.”

Beilein did leave things on 

an optimistic note for LeVert, 
who had surgery in New York 
two weeks ago and is projected 
as a likely second-round pick in 
the NBA Draft on June 23. Once 
LeVert recovers from his most 
recent surgery, Beilein said he 
expects him to be entirely done 
with the current, injury-riddled 
chapter of his career. 

SCHEDULING TWEAKS: 

Michigan 
has 
opened 
its 

last two seasons with games 
against Division II schools: 
Northern Michigan in 2015-16 
and Hillsdale College the year 
before. The NCAA Tournament 
Selection Committee is thought 
to 
ignore 
games 
against 

Division II opposition. The 
Ratings Percentage Index — 
among the committee’s most-
used tools — disregards those 
games entirely.

“I’m rethinking the idea of 

playing a Division II team,” 
Beilein said. “That may be 
something we want to examine 
in the future. … I always like 
to keep the money here and do 
what we could within the state.”

Roster decisions loom for Michigan

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

As things stood on March 24, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team had four incoming recruits 
and 
just 
three 
scholarships 

available. But when asked about 
the team’s scholarship status for 
next season, Michigan coach 
John Beilein told WTKA Radio, 
“It usually works itself out.”

Two weeks later, it already 

has.

Last 
Tuesday, 
the 
team 

announced 
that 
sophomore 

forward Ricky Doyle had been 
granted his release and would 
transfer. Wednesday morning, 
the Wolverines revealed that 
sophomore 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins would follow Doyle 
out the door, heading to Central 
Florida to play for his father, 
recently 
hired 
head 
coach 

Johnny Dawkins.

Beilein no longer has to worry 

about having too many players 
on scholarship in the fall, but 
now, with one extra scholarship 
spot, he has a decision to make.

Does he offer that spot to 

graduating senior guard Spike 
Albrecht, who, not seeing a 
place for himself on next year’s 
roster, 
recently 
announced 

his intention to play out his 
remaining year of eligibility as a 
graduate transfer? Does he add a 
late recruit or bring in a transfer 
of his own to help fill a team 
need? Or does he simply leave 
the scholarship spot open and 
build his 2017 class?

“Anything is possible right 

now,” Beilein said in his season-
ending 
press 
conference 

Wednesday afternoon. “We’re 
going to look at all the options 
that we have. ... What does the 
team need? What do we have to 
do to plug some of the gaps that 
we really have? We have some 
interesting questions we have 
to answer, but I can’t give you 
those all right now.”

Beilein 
mentioned 
that 

Michigan had deficiencies in 

scoring, passing and defense this 
season, and the team needs to 
figure out the best possible way 
to shore those up.

Though Beilein has come under 

fire lately for his reservations 
about graduate transfers within 
conferences — he plans to meet 
with 
new 
Athletic 
Director 

Warde 
Manuel, 
University 

president Mark Schlissel, hockey 
coach Red Berenson, women’s 
basketball coach Kim Barnes 
Arico and football coach Jim 
Harbaugh to further discuss the 
issue — he has no issues with the 
concept of transfers in general, 
and may use it to his advantage.

“I 
have 
nothing 
against 

graduate transfers at all,” Beilein 
said. “I would consider transfers 
from other schools, fifth-year 
graduate transfers (to fill the 
spot).”

Giving Albrecht his place back 

on the team might seem like the 
easy solution, but with junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. back to 
run the point again next season 
and another point guard arriving 
in the form of Xavier Simpson, 
Ohio’s 
2016 
Mr. 
Basketball 

recipient, 
Albrecht 
and 
the 

Wolverines may no longer be the 
best fit. Though Michigan might 
be able to benefit from Albrecht’s 
leadership and experience, it also 
could be better off adding another 
wing player to replace Dawkins.

Though the two sides will 

discuss the possibility of a return 
— 
and 
Beilein 
understands 

that more backlash may come 
from letting a fan favorite 
like Albrecht walk — Beilein 
reiterated that the needs of the 
team as a whole come first.

“I’m always gonna measure 

everything twice so I can cut 
once and find out what is the best 

for Michigan basketball, in the 
long range of the program and 
the short range of the program,” 
Beilein said. “I’ll make that 
decision. (If) we take hits either 
way, we take hits either way. 
That’s the job of the Michigan 
basketball coach — not to go 
against public sentiment, but 
to do what’s best for Michigan 
basketball.”

The 
Wolverines 
aren’t 

currently 
expecting 
any 

further attrition, but Beilein 
acknowledged the possibility 
and expects the final scholarship 
count to become clearer in the 
next few weeks. Any further 
status discussions — such as 
the possibility of reclassifying 
junior forward Mark Donnal, 
who has two years of eligibility 
remaining but had his redshirt 
status 
removed 
before 
this 

season — will take place later.

Wolverines upset 
8th-ranked Duke

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 11 Michigan women’s 

tennis team is no stranger to 
playing ranked opponents. In fact, 
it welcomes the challenge.

As Wednesday’s match wound 

down, all signs pointed to No. 
8 Duke walking away with the 
victory, 
but 
the 
Wolverines 

refused to go down without a fight.

Michigan (5-0 Big Ten, 13-4 

overall) rallied back from a 3-0 
deficit to upset the Blue Devils, 
4-3, in Durham, N.C. 

“We talked about being loose,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein. “I wanted them to 
go in with no pressure on them. 
Obviously Duke’s a great team, 
and I just wanted them to step up.”

At the beginning, this could 

have 
been 
anyone’s 
match. 

All doubles pairs were evenly 
matched, 
but 
it 
was 
senior 

Ronit Yurovsky and junior Sara 
Remynse at No. 3 doubles who 
were the first off the court with a 
score of 6-4.

Sophomores Mira Ruder-Hook 

and Alex Najarian were not far 
behind, though, with a different 
result. They were down early in 
the match and couldn’t recover, 
losing, 6-3.

The winner of the No. 1 doubles 

would secure the doubles point 
for their team, and it appeared 
the Blue Devils (8-2 ACC, 15-4 
overall) would take it. Duke broke 
Michigan’s serve to go up, 5-3, 
challenging the Wolverines to 
defend a match point.

But freshmen Brienne Minor 

and Kate Fahey had something 
else in mind, rallying back to 
force the match into a tiebreaker. 
But, they eventually succumbed 
to Duke’s No. 19 doubles pair, 
ultimately losing the match, 7-6.

The loss of the tiebreaker and 

doubles point seemed to take its 
toll on Michigan in singles play. 
The Blue Devils won five out of six 
first sets, and things didn’t look 
good for the Wolverines.

Following a successful weekend 

for Ruder-Hook, something was 
missing in her 6-0, 6-1 loss.

“It was a tough matchup,” 

Bernstein said. “The (Duke) girl 
played well, and Mira just had a 
rough day.”

Remynse finished shortly after 

Ruder-Hook, losing, 6-2, 6-1.

Duke needed only one more 

singles win to clinch the match, 
and Michigan had a lot of work 
to do. Still, it was clear the 
Wolverines knew what was on 
the line as they appeared much 
sharper in their second sets.

No. 18 Minor was the only 

Wolverine to win her first set, but 
it was a battle even for her. She 
narrowly won, 7-5. She was the 
first to put Michigan on the board, 
winning the second set, 6-2.

After Fahey and Najarian each 

dropped the first set, they both 
rallied to win the second set, 6-0 
and 6-1, respectively.

Then 
Fahey 
and 
Najarian 

accomplished what seemed to be 
the impossible — they won their 
third sets and tied the match at 
3-3. The No. 1 singles match would 
decide the ultimate winner.

It was up to Michigan’s captain, 

No. 16 Yurovsky, to lead her team 
to a victory. After losing the first 
set, 4-6, to Duke’s No. 25 Beatrice 
Capra, Yurovsky needed to make a 
change.

She won the second set in a 

tiebreaker, moving onto the third. 
With her confidence up and 
victory in her sights, she could not 
be stopped as she went on to win 
the third set, 6-3, securing the 
upset for the Wolverines. 

Yurovsky was greeted by the 

team rushing her court before 
she even had the chance to let the 
victory set in.

This win proves this team 

is not limited to success just in 
their conference, and that the 
Wolverines have the potential 
to be one of the top teams in the 
nation.

“It just shows what kind of team 

we can be,” Bernstein said. “It’s 
probably one of the best wins. It 
just showed tremendous heart.”

WOMEN’S TENNIS

Lineup flexibility 
makes Michigan 
more dangerous

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Editor

As the No. 1 Michigan 

softball team continues to 
rank among the nation’s best 
offensive teams, it does so 
while keeping its batting order 
relatively flexible.

It ranks first nationally 

in team scoring average and 
on-base 
percentage, 
second 

in home runs per game, third 
in 
slugging 

percentage 
and 
fifth 

in 
batting 

average. 

Michigan 

coach 
Carol 

Hutchins 
shifts around 
her 
lineup, 

moving 
players 
both 

up and down 
throughout 
the 
course 
of 

the season to match the ebbs 
and flows that their hitting 
undergoes.

“You see kids get hot and 

kids get cold,” Hutchins said. 
“You kinda go with the flow. 
You try not to react — kids 
are going to hit for average. 
Sometimes they’re going to be 
3-for-3 or 0-for-3. But at some 
point, if it looks like they’re just 
not clicking in the order, you 
may move them around, you 
might put them down in the 
order to get them going. It may 
inspire them, it shakes them up 
enough, it helps them get better 
pitches down in the order.”

One player who has moved 

around the order this season 
is 
junior 
shortstop 
Abby 

Ramirez, who has both hit near 
the top of the lineup and at the 
bottom. Ramirez is currently 
batting ninth as she returns to 
form after an ankle injury.

“What I have learned is that 

basically in any position you’re in, 
don’t try and make it any bigger 
than it is,” Ramirez said. “A lot of 
times people think there is more 
pressure at the top of the lineup 
than at the bottom. When I did 
get moved to the top of the lineup 
I tried my best not to think about 
that and just basically do the same 
thing I was doing at the bottom.”

That approach has helped 

Ramirez hit at a .373 clip, 
which gives her the fourth-

highest 
batting 
average 
on 

the team.

And 

the 
lineup 

isn’t 
just 

flexible 
in 

its sequence 
— even with 
the offense’s 
success thus 
far, there is 

room for players to work their 
way into the order.

Sophomore 
infielder 

Amanda Vargas is one example 
of a player who has gradually 
increased 
her 
at-bats 
this 

season, starting regularly now 
as a designated player.

“It’s definitely never set 

in stone,” said senior second 
baseman Sierra Romero. “We 
have a lot of players on our team 
who want to be in the lineup. 
It’s always a competition and 
always a challenge, but it’s 
good competition.

“Everyone’s working for that 

starting spot. Amanda has been 
doing a great job as our (DP). 
She showed so much potential 
when Hutch was randomly 
throwing her in — she was 
hitting bombs. So Hutch was 
finally like, ‘We need to get her 
in the lineup.’ She’s a perfect 
example of doing what’s asked 
and now she’s in the starting 
lineup.”

SOFTBALL

“It’s always a 
competition 
and always a 
challenge.”

EPISODE REVIEW

The title of Sunday’s episode 

of “Girls” makes cringeworthy 
sense once you find out what the 
plot driver is — an experiential 
play that Adam (Adam Driver, 
“Star Wars Episode VII: 
The Force 
Awakens”) is 
in about the 
Kitty Genovese 
murder case 
of 1964 in New 
York City. The 
play frames 
Hannah’s 
(Lena 
Dunham, 
“Happy 
Christmas”) 
discovery 
of Jessa (Jemima Kirke, “Tiny 
Furniture”) and Adam’s more-
than-friends relationship. The 
shots of the play, which span 
beautifully lit alleyways and 
fire escapes, are the aesthetic 
indulgence of “Hello Kitty,” 
but they also highlight the 
theme of the episode (not that 
anyone involved in “Girls” 
would admit to having themed 
episodes). “Hello Kitty” is 
about communication — or 
more precisely, the sometimes 
humorous and sometimes 

bittersweet lack of it.

As always, everyone in “Girls” 

is so wrapped up in themselves 
that they can barely grasp 
things that are right in front 
of them — like the fact that 
Hannah and Fran (Jake Lacy, 
“Carol”) are horribly wrong 
for each other, as seen through 
their vastly different ideas 
about how, when, where and 
to whom it is appropriate for 
Hannah to be flashing her 
vagina (but maybe that’s just 
me).

Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet, 

“Mad Men”) takes a backseat 
in this episode, as does Marnie 

(Allison Williams, “Peter Pan 
Live”) a little bit — although 
Marnie casually dismissing 
Adam and Jessa to Hannah as 
their “second-tier friends” is 
hilarious. This season of “Girls” 
has seen Marnie rediscovering 
something. I’m not sure what 
it is — her voice, a measure of 
independence, astonishing levels 
of annoying self-satisfaction — 
but it’s building to something 
for sure. And Allison Williams 
is doing a phenomenal job of 
making you grit your teeth and 
roll your eyes in exasperated 
anticipation of it.

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO

Daily Food Columnist

I had an odd dream the 

other night, odder than usual. 
I found myself standing next 
to my mother in the kitchen of 
my childhood home, without 
any idea of how I got there. On 
the granite countertop, there 
was a large sheet of wax paper, 
which bore four raw, skin-on 
pork cheeks.

“We’re curing them today, 

right?” I asked, as I moved my 
hand towards one.

My mother slapped it away.
“We’re braising them today,” 

she said. Without speaking 
again, she heated an enamel 
pan on the stove with some 
olive oil and seared each cheek, 
skin-side down, like she used 
to do with chicken on Friday 
afternoons when I was a child. 
I heard the skin sizzle, and 
woke up.

Freud thought that dreams 

were difficult to understand 
because they were the result 
of displacement and conden-
sation, of real-life anxieties 
expressed through vignettes. 
“When in a dream something 
has the character of a spoken 
utterance — that is, when it 
is said or heard, not merely 
thought, and the distinction 
can usually be made with cer-
tainty,” he writes in “The Inter-
pretation of Dreams,” “then 
it originates in the utterances 
of waking life, which have, of 
course, been treated as raw 
material, dismembered, and 
slightly altered, and above all 
removed from their context.”

In my case, Freud was right 

about raw material, dismem-
bered and slightly altered. This 
past school year, I have found a 
new hobby: curing meats. Pork 
cheeks, mostly, but also pork 
shoulders and beef rounds. Off 
in the corner of my dingy little 
basement, I may have as many 
as eight hunks of salted, spiced 
meat hanging at one time. Each 
piece of meat is tied with twine 
and hangs on a coatrack pole I 
liberated from my closet.

I began curing for simple 

enough reasons. I like cured 
meats, but they’re expensive in 
Ann Arbor. I like cooking, and 
wanted to try something more 
advanced. I wanted to feel 
more Italian. I wanted to do 
something out of the ordinary.

The first cured meat I made 

was guanciale, the salted, air-
dried pork cheek that flavors 
many classic pastas in Rome. 
Properly cured, it tastes like 
pure pork, with fat that is 
somehow both crunchy and 
tender. I special-ordered two 
cheeks from the local butcher, 
and found a simple recipe 
online that required neither the 
addition of sodium nitrites (a 

preservative which gives hams 
and salami their cured flavor), 
nor a climate-controlled cham-
ber. Salt, sugar, some aromat-
ics, the cheeks and time. Each 
cheek resembled an irregular 
slab of bacon covered on one 
side by pink skin, with a few 
bristles still attached. They 
looked, when held at the right 
angle, like cheeks. I placed 
them in a plastic bag with the 
cure for about a week, and then 
hung them in the basement to 
dry, with no idea how they’d 
turn out.

I’ve never been so happy to 

see mold. On the thirteenth day 
of curing in my basement, my 
pork cheeks each had a small 
patch of white powder on their 
skin-side, a sign that some air-
borne strain of the penicillium 
genus had decided to make 
their home there. Penicillium 
molds can produce penicillin, 
the antibiotic compound hailed 
as a godsend in the twentieth 
century for its curative powers 
over both battlefield injuries 
and gonorrhea. There wasn’t 
any Nazi schrapnel or clap 
floating around my basement, 
I presume, but the dusting 
of penicillium would protect 
my meat from more sinister 
microbes.

I was proud of my pork 

cheeks. I would inspect them 
daily, running my finger along 
their surface, feeling them go 
from tacky to crusty. I’d make 
puerile jokes to friends who 
came over (“Want to go to the 
basement and see my meat?”). 
I pored over recipes, trying to 
find the perfect ones to gift 
with my precious meat. More 
than pride, though, I felt a 
sense of awe. I had no real idea 
what I was doing. I couldn’t 
tell you what the ambient 
temperature of the basement 
was, or the reduction in water 
weight over the weeks as the 
cheeks slowly dried out. Those 
friendly penicillium molds 
could very easily have been 
unfriendly ones. I was a food-
obsessed amateur at the mercy 
of air and water and microbes.

After three weeks, I brought 

a cheek home to my family for 
Thanksgiving, wrapped gently 
like a newborn. On the granite 
counter in the kitchen, I cut 
into the cheek and revealed a 
shining core, mostly fat with a 
comically small swoosh of pink 
meat. We fried small pieces in 
an enamel pan with olive oil, to 
make a pasta sauce. They tasted 
perfect.

I’m now on my third round 

of curing pork cheeks. When-
ever I look at them, I feel a bit 
happier. Not because I antici-
pate eating them, or because I 
feel manly or sophisticated, but 
because they’re a desire real-
ized. A small one, an ephemeral 

one, but a desire that started 
out as a thought and ended up 
on my dinner plate.

I’ve thought a lot about 

what my pork-cheek dream 
the other night meant. Some 
anxiety about the future, per-
haps. A fear of adulthood, a 
dread of time, a sense of shame, 
I’m not really sure. I have 
many hopes for the future, but 
whether they’ll be realized I 
do not know. I think about this 
uncertainty constantly and 
uncomfortably. But I still have 
my cheeks hanging in the base-
ment, a hope realized by noth-
ing but air and time.

***
Guanciale (cured pork 

cheek)

Two pork cheeks, skin-

on (Order them at your local 
butcher shop)

One half-cup of coarse 

kosher salt

One half-cup of brown sugar
One bunch of fresh thyme
Four cloves of garlic, crushed
One tablespoon of crushed 

peppercorns

Step 1
Wash pork cheeks under 

warm water. In a bowl, mix 
together the salt and sugar. Rub 
the mixture vigorously into 
pork cheeks, making sure to 
cover them completely.

Step 2
Place cheeks in a large plas-

tic freezer bag. Add the thyme, 
garlic, pepper and any remain-
ing salt and sugar, and place 
bag in refrigerator. Allow to sit 
for six days, turning bag over 
every two days to redistribute 
cure. The salt and sugar will 
begin pulling the moisture out 
of the cheeks.

Step 3
After six days, remove 

cheeks from bag and discard 
any liquid. Give the cheeks a 
quick wash in warm water to 
remove excess cure.

Step 4
With a sharp knife, punc-

ture each cheek near the top 
and run a length of kitchen 
twine through the hole, tying 
it off to form a loop.

Step 5
Hang the cheeks in any cool, 

dark place you have — a base-
ment, a spare closet, even a 
garage. Place a pan of salted 
water underneath them so 
they don’t dry out too quickly. 
White mold is beneficial. 
Green or blue mold isn’t, and 
should be scrubbed off with a 
dab of vinegar.

Step 6
After three weeks, the 

cheeks should have shrunk a 
bit and smell like a delicates-
sen. Cut off the skin and any 
yellowish fat, and the remain-
ing flesh can be sliced up and 
fried like bacon, tossed into a 
pasta or added to vegetables.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

Frankie Cosmos’s Next Thing 

is an indie-rock album that 
gets so personal and deep you 
feel like you 
personally 
know the 
band. You can 
hear every 
piece of the 
members in 
the music. It’s 
constructed 
so intricately 
that every song is a malleable 
piece of artwork, waiting to 
be molded by your individual 
perceptions and feelings, and 
that’s why it’s so goddamn 
beautiful.

Next Thing opens with 

the song “Floated In,” with a 
simple drum beat matching the 
guitar. Greta Kline’s (Frankie’s 
real name) voice chimes in 
with its soft charm, singing “I 
floated in and started livin” as 
feathery synths begin to make 
an appearance. This song sets 
the mood for the entire album: 
simplistic, yet emotional, with 
lyrics that are pure poetry.

“Floated In” ends with Kline 

asking, “What are you doin” 
and “If I Had a Dog” begins 
as it discusses common fears 
and insecurities instilled in 
everyone, with the lyrics “Am 
I still so sad / Is that pretty 
lame / Everybody says your 
decisions are OK.” The angsty 
confusion comes to a halt for 
a few moments as the album 
continues into “Embody” 
where things get personal 
as the lyrics reveal names of 
specific friends and things that 
create peace in Kline’s mind.

The album continues, with 

each song becoming a new 
favorite, as the sensual lyrics 
complement the dreamy 
instrumentals, making the 

album feel raw and alive. 
Kline’s soft voice projecting 
dark feelings and confusing 
depression embodies the way 
people interact with their own 
emotions perfectly.

Living in a world where 

mental health issues aren’t 
completely accepted, we find 
that in multiple situations 
we hide from our innermost 
feelings out of fear of being 
vulnerable. We try to project 
somewhat perfect personas. 
These projections are 
embodied by the enjoyable 
instrumentals in Next Thing 
as the lyrics speak to true 
emotions that are yanked 
outside of our “perfect” 
exteriors with every note Kline 
hits.

During the tenth song, 

“Sinister,” Kline sings 
“Sometimes I get sinister / 
Can’t always be like Arthur / 
Sometimes I just feel sinister / 
Can’t always turn to Arthur,” 
displaying the confrontation 
of feelings and the fact that we 
can’t always feel OK, and that’s 
OK.

The album also touches 

on deep insecurities like 
becoming an emotional burden 
to someone, as heard in lyrics 
like “Now that I know that 
every time I get sad you just 
hate me / You can go to sleep 
and sleep it off peacefully / 
I’ll be here all night feeling 
totally fucked” from “Is It 

Possible / Sleep Song.” In the 
song, Kline depicts what it feels 
like to want help, but to be too 
scared to ask for it. This leaves 
someone to deal with strong 
emotions on their own which 
can lead to self-deprecation 
and maybe even the feeling of 
worthlessness. These feelings 
are depicted in the song “I’m 
20” where Kline sings “I’m 20 
/ Washed up already / I’d sell 
my soul for a free pen.”

These emotionally infused 

songs portray what dealing 
with emotions feels like in 
everyone’s head. It’s dark and 
lonely, and it’s easy to get lost 
unless we learn how to express 
ourselves. Next Thing is an 
emotional expression from 
Kline to us, a conversation that 
creates a deep connection with 
the entity of its songs.

Next Thing continues with 

an existential crisis presented 
to listeners in under 20 
seconds at the beginning of 
“Tour Good.” Kline sings “I 
don’t know what I’m cut out 
for / If there’s anything” as 
her voice fills with comfort 
for the void that the crisis has 
made. Kline gives reassurance 
that thoughts like these are in 
everyone’s brain, making the 
pain left by them all the more 
bearable.

All 15 songs on Next Thing 

are three-minute-or-less pieces 
of cathartic artwork. Greta 
Kline never fails to project her 
full self in her music through 
Frankie Cosmos and that 
brutal honesty gives listeners 
something to connect with. 
The elements composed in 
Next Thing evolve together 
to create an existential life 
discussion that would be had at 
3 a.m. on the swings at a park 
with someone you love in just 
under 30 minutes. It’s simple, 
emotional and too beautiful for 
words.

Dreamy Frankie C. 
infused with truth

I was originally going to 

review Andy Black’s “Stay 
Alive,” but it was so bad that 
I decided to listen to Alesso’s 
latest single, 
“I Wanna 
Know.”

Now, let 

it be known 
that I’m not 
the biggest 
fan of EDM/
dance 
music; I think it serves a 
fleeting purpose as far as 
music goes. Each EDM song 
has a lifespan of a few months 
at most before it vanishes 
into an irrelevant abyss — I 
personally don’t know of 
anyone who still listens to 
Avicii’s “Wake Me Up” or 
Swedish House Mafia’s “Don’t 
You Worry Child” — in fact, 
these may be the only EDM/
dance songs some of you can 
name off the top of your head.

However, music isn’t 

always about the ephemeral. 
Sometimes it’s okay for a kind 
of shitty song to be amazing 
in that it captures a moment, 
a time in your life. Thirty 
years from now, I doubt 
future generations will listen 
to “Wake Me Up” or “Don’t 
You Worry Child,” but if any 

of us happen to listen to them 
again, they’ll remind us of the 
days when that’s all the radio 
played.

And I think that’s the 

purpose Alesso’s latest single 
serves. “I Wanna Know” isn’t 
a “great” song. It won’t stand 
the test of time, the majority 
of the world will probably 
hate it and there’s no question 
that it lacks substance and 
creativity. But it’s catchy and 
being “catchy” is paramount 
in 2016.

With a staccato guitar 

intro that eases into the 
techno beat those Swedish 
DJs have perfected so well, “I 

Wanna Know” is the ultimate 
summer jam. Perfect for 
pool parties, driving with 
your windows down or just 
smoking kush with some 
friends, Alesso knows how to 
get you vibing. And with the 
right remix this song will be 
played at every club and bar 
over the summer; it may even 
be the song of the summer. 
But that’s just it — it will only 
be the song of the summer, if 
that, because at the end of the 
day it’s just not a great song. 
And let’s be real, great songs 
are all that really matter.

By ANAY KATYAL

Daily Arts Writer

Sunday mornings at the Katyal 

household meant a welcome 
routine. At the strike of 11 o’clock, 
my father began preparations for 
either chocolate chip pancakes 
or waffles (at my brother’s 
discretion), and I’d fire up Netflix 
and stream an old episode of 
“Top Gear” we had yet to watch. 
As a family, we had our eyes 
collectively glued to the screen 
for the next two hours, laughing 
at wry English automotive jokes 
and enjoying the breakfast my 
dad poured his heart into making 
that morning. With our mouths 
full of chocolate and dough, if 
there was one time of the week 
we were truly a “family,” it was 
those Sunday mornings. When 
our stomachs had enough, we 
began our five hour affair of 
traveling two or three towns 
over to buy our family’s groceries 
for the week. Costco, Trader 
Joe’s, Whole Foods, Caputo’s and 
whatever Indian grocers we felt 
like visiting were usually on the 
list. It was innate for us. It was a 
Sunday constant.

Food was (and still largely 

is) the focal point of my family. 
Growing up, my father used 
to toil at the stove, making us 
dinner from scratch night after 
night. His food was sustenance 
for my brother and me, a means 
to keep us healthy and satiated. It 
was something I came to expect, 
something I never really thought 
about. It took some time to wrap 
my head around the significance 
of it all, but learning how 
uncommon his dedication was 
made me realize something.

Those nightly dinners of palak 

paneer, daal roti or whatever else 
my father felt like whipping up 
meant a lot more than what I gave 
them credit for. Beyond their 
caloric value, the meals he made 
contained a sense of love and 
familial attachment, expressed 
through his labor and culinary 
ingenuity. 
Even 
beyond 
our 

kitchen, my family’s relationship 
with food was much of the same.

Sometimes, the only way our 

family could leave the house was 
if we had a new restaurant to try 
in a part of town we’d never been 
to. We expressed wonder, awe 
and fascination over the meals we 
shared. At those times, we were 
unified both in our emotions and 
our thoughts.

In Plainfield, Ill., where I 

called home growing up, our 
options for food were banal and 
few. Fried chicken from the 
local Jewel-Osco grocery, bland 
vegetable lo mein from a strip 
mall Chinese restaurant, over-
salted and undercooked breakfast 
mush from Larry’s Diner. I guess 
the lack of a cohesive culinary 
landscape didn’t really come 
as a surprise for my father. The 
town is a bastion of everything 
we know and love about Middle 
America; 
there 
were 
farms 

within two or three miles from 
my house, and a cornfield in 
my high school’s backyard. It 
compelled my father enough to 

lug his kids around from town to 
town just to find produce, snacks, 
meals and whatever else he felt 
like feeding us that was up to his 
standard. Our form of a vacation 
was driving into Chicago and 
trying a new restaurant we read 
about, and our form of therapy 
was strolling through the aisles 
of Trader Joe’s and picking 
whatever eclectic snacks we 
could get our hands on. It was 
what we did. Hours away from 
home, it’s something I find myself 
still doing when I’m in need of a 
pick-me-up.

I remember strolling through 

the aisles of Caputo’s with my 
father on the weekends. He tried 
teaching me how to find the 
right mango once. Color, feel and 
consistency were all paramount 
factors in the search, he said. He 
insisted there was a character to 
each mango, and as a shopper it 
was my personal duty to separate 
the bad seeds from the good. I 
honestly used to think he was 
full of shit, but tasting the fresh, 
full flavor of those mangos he 
brought home taught me the 
artistry and emotion my father 
had for food. I remember the face 
he used to make when he found 
the right fruit. Sometimes I find 
myself making the same face. It’s 
funny.

None of it really struck me 

as being bizarre growing up. 
My father’s mania over what 
he cooked and what he fed 
us became second nature in 
our household. I didn’t really 
understand at the time that food 
was an escape for my father. 
But even as a child I knew if 
something was up, making his 
kids a muffaletta sandwich was 
his way of saying “Everything 
is all right.” It became a canvas 
for him to express his creativity, 
a means to channel his soul. 
The strains of a 12-hour-a-day 
corporate job might have left my 
father in a feral, crazed stupor 
after all these years (I can only 
imagine that would be the 
case if I was in his shoes), but 
I guess cooking was an outlet 
to protect his sanity. At the 
end of day, the plates of food he 
arranged probably brought him 
satisfaction through a means 
other hobbies might not have 
been able to. Plopping plates of 
meals he arranged on the kitchen 
table with a face of unabated 
triumph, watching his family 
eat his food with expressions of 
primitive joy and satisfaction 
— those were the moments he 
valued most when he came home, 
I think. And watching my father 
paint portraits of love and soul 
through the meals he made led 
me down a path that embraced 
food along a similar vein.

There were (many) days where 

my father had a habit of making 
something he had never cooked 
before — usually while we were 
watching “Chopped” or “Iron 
Chef.” Watching television chefs 
animatedly 
try 
to 
shoehorn 

durian or jackfruit or stinky 
tofu (or whatever other obscure 
fruits and vegetables you could 
imagine) 
into 
their 
various 

dishes must have lit a bulb in 
his head. The shift from “bored 
man watching TV with kids” to 
“fervent man whose synapses 
won’t stop firing” was funnily 
abrupt and blatant.

Sometimes those days excited 

me, but sometime I also sat in 
my living room with a mix of 
fear and awe at what was to 
come out of the kitchen in a few 
hours. Whether or not those 
experiments panned out (though 
they did more often than not), 
watching his process was what 
caught my attention more than 
the meals he cooked. He was 
an impassioned man in those 
moments, a man who couldn’t be 
pulled from his stove or oven no 
matter how much one tried.

There were times when he’d 

ask me to come sit with him 
when he was preparing that 
night’s dinner. Sometimes, I 
indulged him. But looking back, 
I wish I had accompanied him 
more often. Watching him cook 
those nights felt like watching an 
artisan ply his craft, or watching 
a strained man expunge his 
stresses and worries through 
a labor of passion. No matter if 
he was at the grill, nursing the 
stove or chopping vegetable after 
vegetable on the countertop, the 
different lens through which he 
saw life from the graces of the 
food he was making was always 
evident. The effort he put in 
requited my fascination. The 
personal triumphs he expressed 
were met with my embrace.

Nowadays, I waste my friends’ 

time by talking about some new 
condiment I found at Babo, the 
meat my father, brother and I 
smoked during the holidays, or 
my love for a dish at a restaurant 
I discovered a weekend or two 
ago. My friends sometimes like to 
parrot jokes about my pretentious 
obsessions, but when it comes to 
food I’ve always felt there to be a 
fine line between pretension and 
passion. I’m not sure if my love for 
food was a product of an innate 
predisposition my father and I 
happened to share, or a product 
of being caught in the middle of 
my dad’s illustrious form of an 
escape (or even just a result of 
pretentious inclinations). But the 
countless weekends I spent with 
him watching him cook, or binge 
watching Anthony Bourdain’s 
“No Reservations” while my 
mother was at work, created a 
relationship rooted deeply in the 
virtues of food. Food is a passion 
for my father, and it’s a passion he 
couldn’t help but share with me. 
As a family, we’ve had our trials 
and we’ve had our tribulations, 
but food has been the constant 
that has bound us together. It’s 
how I learned to feel love and 
passion. That’s something I can 
only thank my father for.

When people ask me what I 

miss most about home, I don’t 
really have a singular answer. 
I honestly couldn’t care less 
about any specific place or thing 
left back in Plainfield. Truly, if 
I could just see my father in the 
kitchen more often, that’d be 
enough for me.

Chocolate chip cookies 

aren’t the only steamy things 
drawing undergrads into Mojo 
Dining: The new Instagram 
account @hotdudes_
mojodining also pays homage 
to the dining hall — a hotspot 
for hot guys.

It’s so simple! Even hot guys 

have to eat!

The feed is full of mildly 

attractive boys mid-bite 
accompanied by suggestive 
captions like: “I bet this hot 
dude is happy about mac & 
cheese week and would be 
happy to show you a ‘gouda’ 
time (winkyface emoji, cheese 
emoji)” and “Could it be his 
Valentine that he’s eyeing? Or 
the fresh plate of cookies what 
was just brought out? (two 
diagonal pink hearts emoji).”

The gram which garnered 

the most likes is of “Mojo 
Flicka da Wrist” card swiper 
Darren.

The account was created 

during finals week of fall 
semester, out of boredom and 
inspiration from the Instagram 
account @hotdudesreading. 
The creator, who asked not 
to be named, said she had 
late exams at the end of fall 

semester and spent a lot of time 
in Mojo Dining Hall because 
she lives on the Hill.

“There was nothing left to 

do besides study, so we ended 
up doing what we usually do to 
procrastinate — sitting in the 
dining hall for hours on end,” 
she said.

That was when the account 

was born. 

“I follow an Instagram 

account: hotdudesreading, so 
as we sat there, feeling our 
saneness leaving us, one of 
my friends, jokingly at first, 
was like, ‘We should make a 
hotdudesinmojodininghall 
account!’ ” she said. But as we 
were nearing our third hour of 
sitting in the dining hall, the 
idea sounded better and better 
by the minute. So, as a result of 
our impending craziness, the 
account was made.”

The account encourages 

viewers to submit photos of 
attractive Mojo diners by 
either sending the pictures 
through Instagram messenger 
or by using #hotdudesinmojo. 
As the account has gained 
attention — now yielding 
nearly 300 followers — more 
submitted phots have been 
featured.

“In the beginning, I took 

most of the pictures, but as I 

gained more followers, a lot 
of people started sending in 
pictures, so now, it’s about 
50/50,” the creator said. “When 
I created the account, I didn’t 
think it would have gotten as 
big as it did. Now, I rely a lot on 
the submissions, since it’s not 
exactly an easy task to stakeout 
the dining hall and capture a 
photo of every ‘hot dude’ I see.”

Capturing hot dudes in their 

natural habitat isn’t easy: The 
curator says there are tricks 
to it.

“You gotta be stealthy, like a 

jackal.”

The awkward angled, not 

always perfectly focused 
photos are a testament to that, 
but it’s also what’s appealing 
about the account. That, and 
the dudes. Initially the account 
included photos of guys the 
curator is attracted to, but 
including submissions has 
helped to diversify the feed to 
include a variety of types.

“When I take the pictures, 

I take shots of and feature 
people I find attractive,” she 
said. “But for the submissions, 
I end up featuring pretty 
much every one I get, because 
everyone’s idea of attraction 
is different. Even if I don’t 
find them attractive, it doesn’t 
mean that they’re not.”

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Rihanna’s “Kiss It Better” 

music video is just what 
it should be, just what the 
song lends 
itself to. A 
slow jam 
that feels 
immersed in 
warm, sexy 
fuzziness, 
it’s just the 
track to 
play laying 
scantily in bed, rolling over, 
flipping your hair, breathing 
the soft-spoken vocals. You 
know, just general feelin’ 
yourself vibes.

Shot in black and white, 

the video opens with Rihanna 
under a white sheet (the 
only color of sheets worth 
having, might I add), nipple 
piercings and face visibly 
sheathed under the lacy fabric 
as a single dice shuffles to her 
belly button before three more 
emerge and move across her 

stomach to her pelvis, setting 
the slow and sultry tone. 
Moments before the first lyric 
begin, Rih emerges from the 
sheets, her dark curls nearly 
engulfing her head.

The remainder of the video 

is Rihanna in an over-sized, 
pinstripe coat or a lace nighty 
(never pants, always heels) 
singing, vibing, generally 
missing her boo. She does 

countless hair flips, slides 
her jacket on and off, and 
gives one wicked smile to 
the camera. It’s inarguably 
simple, but the dodgy lighting 
and expert fan use create a 
video that undeniably follows 
its song’s lead, expertly 
capturing the sexy loneliness 
that’s pervasive on “Kiss It 
Better.”

Who would have thought 

that there could be an entire 
movie based around bathing 
culture? Not 
me. And who 
would have 
thought that 
its hijinks and 
hilarity would 
transcend 
culture 
and time? 
Definitely, not 
I. “Thermae 
Romae,” based on the manga 
of the same name by Mari 
Yamazaki, released in 2012 
and screened as part of the 
Cinemanga series presented 
by the Center for Japanese 
Studies at the State Theatre this 
semester, may lack character 
development and an actual plot 
but the movie is just a whole lot 
of fun. It’s quite unlike anything 
else out there and so weird that 
you can’t seem to look away.

The film starts in ancient 

Rome where Lucius, played by 
Hiroshi Abe (“Still Walking”), 
is an architect struggling 
to come up with innovative 
ideas for the empire. While 
bathing in a thermae (a public 
bath in ancient Rome), he sits 
underwater to contemplate on 
architectural ideas. Suddenly, 

he is sucked through a hole in 
the bottom of the pool. And 
here, the absolute peculiarity of 
this film ensues.

Intercutting between a 

large male opera singer belting 
and Lucius swirling through 
water, he travels through space 
and time to modern Japan. 
He pops up into a Japanese 
bathhouse filled with elderly 
Japanese men. Having never 
seen the Japanese before, the 
protagonist mistakes them as a 
group from another part of the 
Roman Empire. He addresses 
them as “slaves” and “flat-
faced.” The fact that Hiroshi 
Abe himself appears Japanese 
only adds to this comic 
time-space transplantation. 
Absolutely amazed by the 
technology of this people, 
Lucius takes mental notes 
on their bathing technology. 
He drinks a Japanese fruity 
milk in a jar and enters into a 
state of total awe about how 
delicious the substance is. 
After shedding tears over the 
beauty of this beverage, he is 
transported back to ancient 
Rome.

The initial sequence is 

absorbing, hilarious and 
completely absurd. Having 
essentially no knowledge of 
bathing culture, whether it be 
Japanese, Roman or whatever 
other culture, does not impede 

the enjoyment of this movie. 
Lucius is transported into this 
foreign world in the same way 
the viewer is thrown into the 
unknown realm of public baths. 
While learning about Japanese 
bathing culture, the viewer is 
engrossed by Lucius’s struggles 
in modern Japan and can’t help 
but laugh at the film’s oddities, 
whether they be a grown man 
crying over fruit-flavored 
milk or how an opera singer 
accompanies his travel through 
the worm hole.

Lucius travels back and forth 

between current Japan, where 
he gathers bathing ideas, and 
the Rome of antiquity, where 
he implements them to the 
emperor’s approval for the 
majority of the film.

However, the movie starts 

at about 100 miles per hour 
and just can’t keep up the 
pace. By midway through, the 
bathing culture jokes quickly 
lose the firepower they once 
had and the loose plot keeps 
an ever-waning interest. A 
large conflict introduced two 
thirds of the way through the 
movie only serves to create a 
vague climax in which Lucius 
architectural prowess is tested.

“Thermae Romae” is worthy 

of a watch if only to experience 
a rare and totally authentic 
weirdness, which it doesn’t try 
to be but rather just is.

FILM REVIEW


By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

Female director Boo Ji-young 

seamlessly blends the line between 
art and activism in “Cart.” The 
screening 
I 

attended 
was 

part 
of 
the 

film 
festival 

Korean Cinema 
NOW, 
that 

showcases 
the 

development of 
Korean culture. 
Before the film, 
a speaker from 
the University of Michigan Nam 
Center for Korean Studies, a key 
sponsor, explained that the film 
and the real-life incident that 
inspired it provoked a heated 
discussion on women’s rights and 
labor rights in South Korea that 
exists to this day. It was a privilege 
to learn more about the East Asian 
country while enjoying their 
cinema that has increasingly (and 
understandably) earned praise in 
the last decade.

The film focuses on Sun-hee 

(Yum Jung-ah, “The Spies”) and 
divorced Hye-mi (Moon Jeong-
hee, 
“Mama”), 
two 
mothers 

who do not live with the fathers 
of their children. They work at 
a major supermarket chain as 
temporary 
workers, 
meaning 

their benefits are limited. In 
spite of the fact many temporary 
workers get stuck in this position 
for several years. Right away, we 
see the difference between the 
two women’s attitude towards 

work: Sun-hee works overtime 
without pay to help her chances 
of getting a vaguely promised 
promotion from the company, 
while Hye-mi is unable to avoid 
conflict with entitled customers 
and struggles to subsequently 
apologize 
as 
demanded 
by 

her 
superiors. 
Both 
women 

comply with the supermarket’s 
regulations, though, as they are 
the only ones sustaining their 
households.

The struggles women face 

to 
keep 
employment 
at 
all 

ages is illustrated in the wide 
variety of women who work at 
the supermarket as temporary 
workers, who are from all walks 
of life and in similarly precarious 
situations. There are recent college 
graduates who can’t get a better 
job, to elderly and poorly educated 
women whose ill husbands can’t 
work and everything in between. 
All of the employees’ stories 
were fit into the film, admirably 
presenting the entire scope of the 
central issue.

Without any warning, all these 

women are suddenly fired without 
any respect paid to the stipulations 
of their contracts. Their company 
plans to avoid having to hire them 
as full-time employees under the 
law by outsourcing their jobs, 
brutally 
showing 
the 
impact 

such 
economic 
advancement 

has on human lives. They come 
together to apply for the creation 
of a union, but fail in doing so. 
The sisterhood they create as 
they find alternative means to 
protest their unfair termination 

and to fight for their jobs back 
proves far more valuable. Taking 
into consideration the women’s 
diverse backgrounds, their united 
front is all the more impressive. 
Eventually, 
a 
full-time 
male 

employee agrees to be their leader 
alongside Sun-hee and Hye-mi as 
they host demonstrations against 
the supermarket chain. 

The men in “Cart” brilliantly 

play a critical role in presenting 
common opposing views when 
discussing gender equality in the 
workplace, without ever resorting 
to stereotypes that oversimplify 
the real patriarchy into villains 
with one-track minds. The way the 
busy, patronizing head executives 
of 
the 
supermarket 
chain 

repeatedly dismiss the protests 
as “sensitive” women getting out 
of control was very reflective of 
real-world enterprise. Not only 
did it show the sexist indifference 
fueled by business that allowed for 
the inequality to happen, but also 
their lack of understanding of the 
women’s economic instability that 
caused it.

“Cart” 
not 
only 
brings 

awareness to unfair practices 
targeting 
vulnerable 

demographics in real life, but also 
manages to keep you engaged 
with well-paced setbacks and 
advancements that never feel 
derived. 
The 
additional 
star 

power of a lead singer from the 
popular K-pop group EXO having 
the role of Sun-hee’s son will peak 
the interest of anyone, really, who 
cares about Korean pop culture. 
Or women. Or workers. Or people.

‘Cart’ serves up an 
artful slice of reality

A couple weeks ago, “How to 

Get Away with Murder” ended 
its second season at a series low 
rating. The finale brought in 5.29 
million viewers and a 1.4 rating 
in the key 18-49 demographic. 
While that number might seem 
decent for a 10 p.m. drama in 
this day and age (in fact, it was 
the highest rated 10 p.m. show 
on ABC that week), when you 
compare it to its season one 
finale, it stops looking pretty. 
Last year, the finale of “Murder” 
earned 8.99 million viewers, and 
a 2.8 demo rating, which is double 
season two’s finale number.

There’s no way to sugarcoat 

it, a 50-percent drop year-
to-year is awful. While there 
are other factors at play here, 
including a similar drop for its 
lead-in “Scandal” in the 9 p.m. 
slot, it seems like a good chunk 
of the audience has given up on 
“Murder.”

“Murder” ’s not alone. ABC’s 

lineup is populated with dramas 
that started well but faded over 
time. In its first season, “Once 
Upon a Time” averaged over a 
3.0 in the key demo. The latest 
episodes have scored a 1.3, 1.3 
and 1.1 in the key demo. “Castle” 
has also dropped substantially 
from prior seasons in both total 
viewers and the demo. Then, 
there’s the case of “Marvel’s 
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” which 
started out averaging above a 2.0 
for the first half of its first season, 
but barely registered at a 0.9 
demo rating this week.

The problem isn’t just at ABC 

either. “Supergirl” opened up 
to a strong, “Big Bang Theory”-
driven 3.1 in the fall over at CBS. 
By episode five, the series was 

getting half that rating, settling in 
between a 1.3 and 1.8 depending 
on the week. The show lost about 
half its initial audience by the 
time it settled down. There’s also 
“The Muppets” on ABC, which 
opened to a solid audience of 9 
million viewers and a 2.9 demo 
rating. However, by episode four, 
the show was only pulling low 1’s. 
After a hiatus where the show 
retooled and rebooted itself, the 
show opened to a 0.9 and only 
dropped during its winter run.

These are examples of a 

trend which is pervasive across 
broadcast 
television. 
Viewers 

have shown they’re willing to 
sample shows, but they’re not 
necessarily 
willing 
to 
stick 

around.

This is one of the hardest 

questions 
facing 
network 

executives today. What factors 
lead to viewers turning away 
from a show? How do you make 
your show a nice saute instead of 
a brief flash in the pan?

What I find to be a big driver 

of 
drops 
between 
seasons 

is something driven by the 
necessity of TV scheduling — the 
long break. A network TV series 
will make at most 24 episodes 
in a year, leaving a substantial 
amount of time without it airing. 
When shows like “Murder” 
or 
“Rosewood” 
drop 
upon 

returning from a long break, it’s 
an easy thing to point blame at. 
However, 
because 
serialized 

shows do not repeat well, this 
is still the best way to schedule 
dramas, despite the potential for 
dropping.

However, multiseason drops 

can also be associated with 
natural attrition. Pretty much 
every single show on TV suffers 
some sort of decline as they age. 
“NCIS,” for example, is averaging 

a 2.26 in the key demo, which is 
down substantially from the 4.0 
it averaged just three years ago. 
This trend is probably one of the 
hardest to avoid, as there’s no 
way to stop time.

However, neither of those 

explain why new shows are 
suffering 
precipitous 
drops 

within a few episodes of their first 
airing, though it’s hard to come 
up with a general rule because 
of how individualized each case 
is. Take “The Muppets.” Its 
decline can be attributed to a pure 
audience rejection of its format, 
which featured a fighting Kermit 
and Miss Piggy and some more 
conventional 
sitcom 
elements. 

With “Supergirl,” it could be the 
superhero show didn’t mesh well 
with a CBS audience used to crime 
procedurals.

Yet, for everything in TV which 

points to a trend, there’s something 
which bucks the trend. And last 
season, nothing worked to destroy 
conventional wisdom in how TV 
works more than “Empire.” Much 
has been written about how the 
music industry drama grew each 
week in total viewers and almost 
every week in the demographic, 
ending up at 17.6 million viewers 
and a massive 6.9 in the demo. 
While the show’s second-season 
numbers have not reached that 
high, the series is still averaging 
4.77 demo rating.

Not 
every 
show 
can 
be 

“Empire.” The series seems to 
be a special case where it caught 
on in a big way, and there doesn’t 
seem to be a clear way to prevent 
declines at the level of “How 
to Get Away with Murder” or 
“Scandal.” Networks have tried to 
be clever with scheduling or with 
formats to try to bring viewers in, 
but there’s no clear-cut way of 
keeping them once they arrive.
