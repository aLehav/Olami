By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
LSA junior Chris Osborn, Cen-
tral Student Government trea-
surer, became the first candidate
to throw a hat in the ring for the
upcoming CSG presidential race
when he launched a new political
party, forUM, on Sunday.
youMICH offered Osborn
its presidential nomination on
Monday, but Osborn declined the
offer on Friday.
The election dates, which have
yet to be approved by the Univer-
sity Council, are tentatively set
for March 27 and 28. Osborn is
the only confirmed presidential
candidate for the race because
youMICH has yet to nominate a
presidential candidate and LSA
junior Omar Hashwi, the current
CSG vice president, declined to
comment on his plans for March.
In addition to a presidential
slate, forUM will also be running
candidates for representative
positions. Osborn said forUM

party
will be looking both inside and
outside of the walls of the CSG
chambers for possible candi-
dates.
"We definitely want to recruit
internal talent, but we also recog-
nize that this is an opportunity,"
Osborn said. "Some students just
don't know about it, and we want
to do our best that they do know
about and that they can enact
change through the medium of
Central Student Government."
LSA junior Hayley Sakwa,
Osborn's running mate, has no
CSG experience. Osborn said
he met her only last weekend
through a mutual friend, but was
immediately struck by how well
they got along. He also lauded
her work with the Jewish Detroit
Initiative, which she co-founded.
A veteran of student govern-
ment at the University, Osborn
was an assembly representative
before being becoming trea-
surer in the administration of
current CSG president Manish
Parikh: Osborn said he had been
approached in January about
the possibility of running for
president. Public Policy senior

CITY COUNCIL
Task force to
explore future
of A2public art

Council members
look for alternate
funding sources
By FARONE RASHEED
Daily Staff Reporter
With voters' rejection of the
proposed art millage on the
November ballot and subsequent
suspension of the Percent for
Art program, the direction of
Ann Arbor's public art program
remains undetermined.
To find a clear path for the
project and to brainstorm pos-
sible funding options, the Ann
Arbor City Council has created
the Public Art Task Force. The
group is composed of City Coun-
cilmembers Christopher Taylor
(D-Ward 3), Margie Teall (D-
Ward 4), Sabra Briere (D-Ward
1), Sally Hart Petersen (D-Ward
2) and Stephen Kunselman (D-
Ward 3).
The suspended Percent for
Art program allowed art to be
acquired, installed and main-
tained only if it's part of a capital
improvement project. Briere said

the cityhasn't done enoughto find
alternative sources of funding.
"There has been little or no
effective effort to seek funding
from sources other than taxes,"
Briere said.
Taylor expressed a desire to
collaborate and put forward the
most viable financial proposal
to the council by April 1, when
funding for the Percent for Art
program is scheduled to resume.,
"Ouraesthetic environment is
important to the city's success,"
Taylor said, arguing in favor of
the program. "Our goals remain
the same, but we'll move away
from pooling funds in the way
that we hadbefore."
Several projects already
underway - including artwork
for the East Stadium Bridge,
Argo Cascades and a rain gar-
den at First and Kingsley streets
- were unaffected by funding
freezes and have continued on
schedule.

It was the result of nearly a
year of planningand a desire for
community, and it was almost
derailed entirely by the weather.
But people from around
the world braved the snow to
attend the first Ross Africa
Business Conference Friday,
where they engaged in panels,

lectures and discussions.
The most anticipated event
of the day included a visit from
Samson Rapheal Osagie, the
minority whip of the Federal
House of Representatives of
Nigera, who spoke on behalf
of the Speaker of the House,
Aminu Waziri Tambuwal.
During his keynote speech, he
stressed the relevance of the
continent as a business power -
a far cry, he believes, from what
is often portrayed in the media.
"Africa's economy is one of
the most resilient in the world,"
Tambuwal said. "Africa is in
a position to become the sec-

and fastest growing region in
the world, and an increasingly
attractive place for potential
investors, and it could be even
better by the end of the year."

Union travel agency
closes unexpectedly

New U.S. commander for
forces in Afghanistan

'U' officials: unclear
whether space will
be filled by fall
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
Among the numerous chang-
es the coming year will bring
to the Union, the branch of the
STA Travel Agency located in

the basement of the Union has
unexpectedly closed its doors.
STA is largely involved in
helping students plan trips and
book flights for vacations and
study abroad.
Michigan Union Director
Susan Pile said the closure was
STA's decision and the Univer-
sity had no say in the matter.
"Corporate decided to close
eight locations nationally, and
this was one of the decisions

that they felt they had to make,"
Pile said. "They didn't disclose
their reasons for doing so, but
we can only speculate that it
had something to do with the
productivity of the location."
There are 14,000 to 15,000
retail travel agencies today
compared to the 34,000 in the
mid-1990s, according to Pho-
CusWright, a travel research
firm.
Because this decision was so
sudden, the University hasn't
yet contemplated options for
filling the space. Pile said they
are unpertain at this time if
they will have another com-
pany renting the space in the
fall.
"It's unfortunate that this
happened, obviously," Pile
said. "But it's a corporate
decision, and they are well
within their rights to do that."
Both the Unionlocation and
STA's corporate offices could
not be reached after several
attempts for comment, and
the University doesn't have
any data on student use of the
business.
LSA senior Emily Schapka
booked two flights to France
and Germany. with STA. She
said she had shopped around
online to compare prices, but
was satisfied with her expe-
rience with the travel agency.
Schapka said she believes
that she saved both time and
money using the agency, but
that the real value came from
having her own agent, espe-
cially when she had to switch
the dates of her flights to
France.
"When I realized I had
a conflict with the dates of
my trip, it was so much more
convenient to talk to the
same person," Schapka said.
Last week, unknown
pranksters posted a sign near
the former location of STA
suggesting that Chick-fil-A
would fill the space. How-
ever, union officials said the
signs were a hoax.

Marine Gen.
Dunford will lead
war's final strech
KABUL, ' Afghanistan ,(AP)
- Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford
took charge of U.S. and NATO
forces in Afghanistan on Sunday
as the coalition enters its final
stretch of the more than 11-year-
old war.
The new commander faces
daunting challenges, including
making sure Afghan government
forces are ready to take control
and orchestrating the withdrawal
of foreign forces during the next
23 months.
Dunford, who will likely be the
last commander of the U.S.-led
international military coalition,
succeeded Marine Gen. John
Allen, who oversaw the buildup of
governmental security forces and
dealt with a series of setbacks -
from Quransburned ataU.S.base
to a spike in deadly insider attacks
that killed international troops.
"Today is not about change, it's
about continuity," Dunford said
during the handover ceremony
at the coalition's headquarters
in Kabul. "What's not changed
is the growing capability of our
Afghan partners, the Afghan-
national security forces. What's
not changed is our commitment.
More importantly, what's not
changed is the inevitability of our
success."
The change in command
comes at a critical time for Presi-
dent Barack Obama, who may
use Tuesday's State of the Union
address to announce a timetable
for pulling out the remaining
American combat forces by the
end of 2014 and plans for a residu-
al U.S. force post-2014.
Dunford faces the challenge
of overseeing the drawdown of
about 100,000 - foreign troops,
including 66,000 from the United
States, and helping the Afghans
counter insurgent groups, includ-
ing the Haqqani network, that
show no sign of compromise. The
Haqqani network, based in Paki-

stani tribal areas near the Afghan
border, has ties to al-Qaida and
is thought to be responsible for
many attacks on U.S. and Afghan
forces,.including the recent spate
of so-called insider attacks.
Dunford also must help
Afghanistansecure its nextpresi-
dential election in 2014 - the first
ballot since the U.S. invasion that
will not include President Hamid
Karzai as a candidate.
"Much work lies ahead," Gen.
Martin Dempsey, chairman of
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said at the ceremony, which was
attended by senior Afghan and
U.S. military officials. Karzai did
not attend.
Relations between the United
States and Pakistan have greatly
improved in recent months after
a series of visits to Islamabad by
Allen. Allen has worked to patch
up ties after they hit historic lows
following a border airstrike in
late 2011 that killed two dozen
Pakistani soldiers. Allen took
Dunford along last week to Islam-
abad when he paid a farewellvisit
to the chief of the Pakistani army,
Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
Allen has been nominated to
lead NATO forces in Europe after
being exonerated in a Pentagon
investigation of questionable
email exchanges with a Florida
woman linked to the sex scan-
dal that led CIA Director David
Petraeus to resign.
Allen, 59, of Warrenton, Vir-
ginia, was the longest serving
commander of U.S. and coali-
tion troops in Afghanistan so far.
Nearly two dozen generals have
commanded troops from the
United States and other nations in
the coalition since the American
invasion in late 2001 - with'six
U.S. generals, including Dunford,
running both commands in the
past five years alone.
Afghan Defense Minister
Bismullah Khan Mohammadi
applauded Allen's military cam-
paign against the insurgents.
"The efforts and the role played
by Gen. Allen to apply military
pressure against the Taliban and
terrorists through joint special

operations have led to the death
and capture of many terrorists
and Taliban leaders," Mohamma-
di said. The operations, he added,
allowed Afghan forces to expand
their control'across areas heavily
influenced by the Taliban.
Obama said last month that
the Afghans would take over this
spring instead of late summer
- a decision that could permit a
speedier withdrawal of foreign
forces from Afghanistan.
Allen said he told Dunford
"our victory here will never be
marked by a parade or a point in
time on a calendar when victory
is declared. This insurgency will
be defeated over time by the legit-
imate and well-trained Afghan
forces that are emerging today
and who are taking the field in
full force this spring."
Allen, however, has acknowl-
edged that the Afghans still have
work to do to become an effective
and self-sufficient fighting force.
But he said a vast improvement
in their abilities was behind a
decision to accelerate the time-
table for putting them in the lead
nationwide this spring when the
traditional fightingseasonbegins.
Although the Afghan secu-
rity forces are almost at their
full strength of 352,000, persis-
tent violence and insider attacks
against Americans and other for-
eign forces have raised concerns
about whether they are ready to
take on the fight bythemselves.
Dunford has to deal with "nav-
igating the drawdown, keeping
a sense of calm before (Afghan)
presidential elections" and main-
taining progress against insider
attacks, said Michael O'Hanlon
from the Brookings Institution
in Washington. "Then, of course,
there's the issue of gradually
working more closely with Paki-
stan."
Much depends on the U.S.
negotiating a bilateral secu-
rity agreement with the Afghan
government that includes the
contentious issue of immunity
from Afghan prosecution for any
U.S. forces that would remain in
Afghanistan after 2014.

the region with up to 3 feet of
snow was blamed for at least
14 deaths in the Northeast and
Canada, and brought some of
the highest accumulations ever
recorded. Still, coastal areas
were largely spared catastroph-
ic damage despite being lashed
by strong waves and hurricane-
force wind gusts at the height of
the storm.
Hundreds of people, their
homes without heat or electric-
ity, were forced to take refuge
in emergency shelters set up in
schools or other places.
"For all the complaining
everyone does, people really
came through," said Rich Din-

smore, 65, of Newport, R.I.,
who was staying at a Red Cross
shelter set up in a middle school
in Middletown after the power
went out in his home on Friday.
Dinsmore,whohasemphyse-
ma, was first brought by ambu-
lance to a hospital after the
medical equipment he relies on
failed when the power went out
and he had difficulty breathing.
"The police, the fire depart-
ment, the state, the Red Cross,
the volunteers, it really worked
well," said the retired radio
broadcaster and Army veteran.
Utility crews, some brought
in from as far away as Georgia,
Oklahoma and Quebec, raced
to restore power to more than
300,000 customers - down
from 650,000 in eight states
at the height of the storm. In
hardest-hit Massachusetts,
where some 234,000 custom-
ers remained without power on
Sunday, officials said some of
the outages might linger until
Tuesday.
Driving bans were lifted
and flights resumed at major
airports in the region that had
closed during the storm, though
many flights were still canceled
Sunday.
The Boston-area public
transportation system, which

shut down on Friday after-
noon, partially resumed sub-
way service and some bus
routes on Sunday. Beverly
Scott, general manager of the
Massachusetts Bay Transpor-
tation Authority, said full ser-
.vice was expected on Monday
- albeit with delays.
"Give yourself more time
and expect that it is going
to take us more time," Scott
advised riders.
Boston public schools were
among many in the region that
had already decided to cancel
classes on Monday.
Boston recorded 24.9 inches
of snow, making it the fifth-
largest storm in the city since
records were kept. The' city
was appealing to the state and
private contractors for more
front-end loaders and other
heavy equipment to clear snow
piles that were clogging resi-
dential streets.
On eastern Long Island,
which was slammed with as
much as 30 inches of snow,
hundreds of snowplows and
other heavy equipment were
sent in Sunday to clear ice- and
drift-covered highways where
hundreds of people and cars
were abandoned during the
height of the storm.

Staff attorney
dispells myths
about global crime,
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
University alum Elizabeth
Campbell, a staff attorney at
the University of Michigan
Law School's Human Traffick-
ing Clinic, presented a speech
on human trafficking Friday to
educate the community on the
effects of the all-too-prevalent
crime.
The Human Trafficking Clin-
ic, started in 2009, is the only
legal clinic solely dedicated to
human trafficking in the United
States. It provides comprehen-
sive legal representation to vic-
tims of labor and sex trafficking.
In her speech, Campbell dis-
pelled myths about human traf-
ficking. For instance, contrary
to common knowledge, human
trafficking doesn't need to
involve movement, coercion can
be either physical or psychologi-
cal and labor trafficking is much
more common than sex traffick-
ing.
Through force, fraud and
especially coercion, individu-
als are exploited for commer-
cial benefit, but not necessarily
money, Campbell said.
"Human trafficking is a form
of modern day slavery. It is a
crime entirely based on exploi-
tation," Campbell said. "U.S.
citizens can be, and in fact are,
victims of trafficking here in the
United States."
Campbell expressed concern
that Congress has not reautho-
rized the Trafficking Victims

Protection Act, which protects
undocumented immigrants who
may be trafficking victims.
The reality that human traf-
ficking is closer to home than
expected was highlighted by
LSA junior Khushi Desai. She
explained that several cases
have been discovered in the Ann
Arbor area.
"A former U of M janitor
is currently in jail for human
trafficking and forced labor
charges because he tried to pass
off four immigrants as his own
children," she continued. "He
forced them to do housework
and physically abused them,
even threatened them if they
tried to leave."
The Global Scholars Program,
a living learning community in
North Quad, chose a human traf-
ficking theme for the program's
monthly lectures this semes-
ter. After drug dealing, human
trafficking is the second largest
criminal industry in the world
and the fastest growing.
Jennifer Yim, the founder and
director of GSP, said the com-
munity's goal is to help students
understand international issues
better.
"(GSP) brings together inter-
national and U.S. students to
engage in social justice educa-
tion on aglobal level," Yim said.
LSA junior Nora Dagher said
she's glad GSP exists so that stu-
dents can have an open dialogue
about human trafficking.
"Human rights is definitely
something that I'm really pas-
sionate about," said Dagher.
"We want to impact the commu-
nity in any way we can and talk
about issues that people don't
really talk about in mainstream
media."

Neighborhoods languish through
Detroit's continued fiscal problems

Detroit residents
still questioning
city's progress
DETROIT (AP) - Four years
ago Toni McIlwain's Ravendale
neighborhood on Detroit's east
side was splattered with doz-
ens of vacant and burned out
houses and lots strewn with
trash and blanketed in waist-
high weeds.
Things have changed - for
the worse, according to McIl-
wain who believes Ravendale
and other poor areas of Detroit
haven't received enough atten-
tion as first-term Mayor Dave
Bing struggles to put out fiscal
fires elsewhere.
"I can understand some of
Bing's plans," said McIlwain,
chief executive of a nonprofit
that operates a community
center and education and drug
prevention programs. "But
even those that are left behind
have to feel that their dignity is
served."
As Bing prepares to deliv-
er his fourth State of the
City address on Wednesday,
some things clearly have not
improved. The crime rate is
amongthe highestin the nation,
people continue to move out,
the tax base still is falling and
the budget deficit of just under
$300 million nearly mirrors
what Bing inherited in 2009.
A state-appointed review
team has until Saturday to
deliver its verdict on the state of
Detroit's finances. If the team
determines there is a finan-
cial emergency, Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder could begin
the process of placing Detroit
under an emergency manager
and state oversight.
Even that doesn't guarantee
relief for residents, said John
Mogk, a Wayne State Univer-

sity law professor who spe-
cializes in land use and urban
development issues.
"The role of an emergency
manager is to balance the books
to bring the fiscal house in
order," Mogk said "It's a whole
separate issue to what's going
onin the neighborhoods. I think
any mayor who would have
taken office at the time Mayor
Bing did would essentially have
experienced the same kind of
decline in the neighborhoods."
Mogk said Detroit's median
household - income is about
$25,000 a year - about half
the national median income.
Unemployment far surpasses
the national average. Most city
residents can't afford improve-
ments to their homes or support
small retail.
"Detroit's economy has not
seen an uptick," Mogk said.
"The way you begin to restruc-
ture the economy and invest-

ment base in the city takes a
considerable amount of time."
The job is massive and Bing
could be running out of time.
His term ends after 2013 and he
has yetto announce whether he
will seek another four years in
office.
He and other candidates
have until May 14 to file peti-
tions to run for mayor. Detroit
Medical Center chief execu-
tive Mike Duggan and Wayne
County Sheriff Benny Napo-
leon are among a number of
people considering a run for
Bing's job.
"The mayor has had to make
some tough decisions that have
not pleased some folks in the
neighborhoods, and more will
have to be made to avoid an
emergency manager," Mogk
said. "Those negative situa-
tions usually result in a part
of the population looking for
alternative candidates."

Breaking down the budget
Snyder's proposal has potential, but some funding is misplaced
n Feb. 7, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder released his proposed
budget for the 2014 fiscal year. Though Snyder made some
positive recommendations like health care expansion, his
proposal fell flat in its suggested funding for the Michigan State Police
and Department of Corrections. Instead of focusing on correctional
facility spending, the governor should look to crime prevention and
criminal rehabilitation as a solution. While the proposed funding for
mental health courts is a positive step for Michigan, the 10.5-percent
increase in funding for MSP is misplaced. Our executive and legislative
branches should focus on local law enforcement rather than state law
enforcement. While Snyder's budget proposal effectively moves beyond
party lines, his proposals suggest misplaced funding for correctional
facilities and MSP and ignores many of Michigan's pressing problems.

i ;

Stigmatized style*

Snyder's budget recommends $8.7 bil-
lion for medical services and $2.4 billion - a
1.1-percent increase - for the long-term care
programthat's partof Medicaid. Over the next
10 years, the state of Michigan is expected to
save more than $1 billion under the Afford-
able Care Act. This proposal could potentially
reduce the number of uninsured individuals
in the state of Michigan by 46 percent. It also
calls for $3 million in health innovation grants
for the Department of Community Health.
Snyder's proposal for health care expansion
is a positive recommendation, and Michigan's
legislation should take control of the federally
funded ACA.
On the other hand, Snyder's resolution to
continue funding Michigan's. correctional
facilities with approximately $2 billion per
year is illogical. Our state currently incarcer-
ates 43,000 prisoners. The number of inmates
and amount of funding for a "secure prison
system",remains practically unchanged from
the currentfiscalyear. Michigan'sgovernment
should use crime prevention and other more
effective methods of rehabilitation, instead
of condemning nonviolent criminals, like
drug offenders, to penitentiaries. Rather than
housing and releasing criminals without ade-
quately looking into the root of the problem,
the state should implement proactive solutions
such as therapy and recovery programs.

In the proposedbudget, Snyder also recom-
mends an additional $33.5 million in funding
for MSP. The funding is supposedly going
to benefit MSP core programs such as road
patrol, motor carrier enforcement, investiga-
tive services, etc. While it's usually advanta-
geous to have more patrolmen on our streets,
the government needs to focus its spending on
local law enforcement agencies rather than
MSP. Michigan is home to two of the most vio-
lent cities in the nation, Flint and Detroit. In
order to reduce the number of violent crimes
in these cities specifically, local law enforce-
ment needs to be strengthened with financial
help from the state government. Snyder also
proposes funding for state troopers to provide
enforcement services at Belle Isle Park. This
is irrational considering the city of Detroit
recently turned down the state's offer to take
over Belle Isle.
Snyder's recommendation for the upcom-
ingbudget is constructive, with approximate-
ly 75 percent of the funding going toward
education, human services and community
health. The governor seeks to expand health
care across the state, potentially insuring
320,000 more residents in the first year alone.
However, Michigan's executive and legis-
lative branches should seek to reorganize
spending toward our correctional facilities
and state police.

ast week, Katie Steen wrote
a great column about the
difficul-
ties women
face due to the
clothes they
wear, whether
as professionals
in the workplace
or students
conforming to
a school dress JAMES
code. However, BRENNAN
I did take issue
when she start-
ed talking about men. Don't get me
wrong, most men do have a much
easier time getting through the
whole clothing issue than women.
But, the black community espe-
cially deals with a quite damaging
stigma surrounding dress choice.
The way our society defines
proper attire is not just sexist, but
also inherently racist. Black youth
have been associated with fashion
choices such as sagging their pants
and wearing backwards baseball
caps. In passing dress codes that
forbid these style choices, schools
have effectively instructed young
men and women that the popular
styles in their demographic are
wrong, while "white" fashion is
right. All this amounts to is a codi-
fied decision that one culture is
inherently better than another.
Young black men are told that
the fashion trends popular in their
community are not allowed - that
sagging pants and backwards hats
equate to the uniform of a crimi-
nal. This simply isn't true. Movies
and television may have us believe
that certain types of dress are syn-
onymous with thugs, but clothing is
nothing more than personal style -
a point made clear in my interview
with Harwood McClerking, an
assistant professor of political sci-

ence at Ohio State University. He's
a visiting scholar at the Center for
Political Studies here at Michigan
and specializes in black politics.
McClerking - typically dressed
in track pants, a long sleeve t-shirt
and baseball cap - is an embodi-
ment of the very concept that
clothes don't make the man. We
talked extensively about differ-
ent issues surrounding dress codes
and cultural perceptions of dress,
drawing on McClerking's experi-
ence as a police officer in Colum-
bus, Miss. He explained to me that
in the beginning of his career,tthe
gang film "Colors" came out and
several of his colleagues began
identifying gang members by their
clothing choices. Despite a huge
absence of major gang activity in
Mississippi at this time, pop cul-
ture socially constructed an idea in
officers' minds about the existence
of gangs and how to identify them.
Sadly, he explained, kids took
cues from these movies too. Baggy
clothes, big coats; low pants and
all-black outfits were the rage, but
also the target of police profiling.
This has, of course, translated into
school dress codes, where parents
and administrators have banned
certain styles as a way to combat
"gangs" and "crime." I can remem-
ber my sixth grade social studies
teacher explaining that sagging
pants were banned because "certain
groups of people do that to keep
their guns there."
When I was in middle school,
all of my friends rocked the sag-
ging pants. We did it just because it
looked "cool" at the time. Some of
my friends still do it. Our fashion
rights were trampled on just the
same as black kids, but as whites, we
had our own cultural style that was
accepted. Black kids are told that
the fashion they choose is inferior

to mine. Sure, I'll admit that walk-
ing into a workplace in jeans, a white
tee and Jordans would be frowned
upon, but it's not like a student of any
race shouldn't be able to wear this
outfit to class. If schools required a
jacket and tie, maybe this argument
would be made, but dress codes tell
kids that one type of casual fashion
is higher on the social ladder than
another - it has absolutely nothing
to do with workplace clothing.
Race is a social
construction, and
so is fashion.
I was always taught to dress well
and dress conservatively - not
for me, but for whoever I may end
up meeting. Looking "like a thug"
would make people draw unfair
conclusions about me, resulting in
lost opportunities. However, I was
also taught in school not to judge
others based on how they looked.
We saw a lot of pictures of people in
hijabs, sombreros and other "ethnic
clothes." But dress codes imply the
exact opposite. Whether it's label-
ing a girl with short shorts as a slut
or telling a black kid with baggy
pants that he looks. like a crimi-
nal, judging on appearance alone
goes against all the things school
taught us. about diversity. Race
is a social construction, and so is
fashion. How we appear is noth-
ing more than our personal style.
If our schools and society plan on
teaching real acceptance and toler-
ance, then it's time we start to actu-
ally accept and tolerate everyone.

Invest li 1776

Cap ital-T true'

The Wall Street Journal published a rivet-
ing piece last Monday called "Thomas Jeffer-
son, Investment Guru" by Romain Hatchuel.
Hatchuel states the need for old-school style
investing - like, really old school. He claims
that at their core, people have a remarkable
sense of patriotism. He observes that life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness are at
the essence of market movements. Citing the
recession as an example, consumption was
bound to the things we can touch and feel -
commodities have always been a classic hedge
against the bear market.
"Life" was manifested in the resilience of
the housing market. "Liberty" was represent-
ed in the immediate need for credit reform.
"The pursuit of happiness" was indicated by
market outperformance during the past five
years in the soda, entertainment and restau-
rant sectors. It's not impossible to beat the
market - we just get ourselves into trouble
when we look beyond the basic desires of
humanity itself.
So the status of the economy boils down to
people. While we get lost in the acronyms -
CMBSs, LBOs and CDOs - we can attribute
some portion of the recession to neglect of
human interest. It seems too convenient that
such oversight came in the midst of the tech
era. The information age has driven us so far
down the side streets of knowledge that we get
lost in our own neighborhood. It's our genera-
tion's prerogative to right the ship. But let's put
our money where our mouth is.
The first step toward the rediscovery of
people is investing in ourselves. That requires
an intimate understanding of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. We must be daring
enough to reflect upon what really makes us
happy, as opposed to what we think should
make us happy. We must be brave enough to
pursue anything and everything that makes
life worth living. The pursuit of happiness was

never intended to be passive, nor easy.
To liberate ourselves, we need to take a step
forward before we can step back and admire.
Initiative is the force that breaks us out of
the social current. The University of Michi-
gan embraces that more than any place: The
resources are everywhere around you, but
no one's going to beg you to take advantage.
"Declaring" should not be about the idea of
declaring - it's a lot more intimate than that.
We declare for us, not for them. Living the life
we want comes from havingthe liberty to pur-
sue our own happiness.
The second step in the process regards
investing in others. To support humanity in all
of its life, liberty and happiness is to expand
outward. We must be open to gaining perspec-
tive and to building relationships. David Wes-
sel wrote about the role of trust in the market.
As "credit" is in essence a valuation of trust, it
follows that the lending crisis was as much a
betrayal of trust as anything else. The reces-
sion, he claims, was a true exhibition of the
disconnect between people: Relationships
fell apart. And, without any inclination to the
"worth" oftrustingeach other, people receded
into their shells. Lending and borrowing is the
fiscal means of empowerment. Supporting one
another is but good business.
I would hope that we all try to kick it a little
more old school. Value people for who they are,
not how they appear. In order to best benefit
ourselves, each other and the communities in
which we live, our focuses must be human. We
all benefit when we do exactly what we please
and are open to others who do the same. So
invest like it's 1776. Care enough aboutyourself
to never settle. Care enough about others to
create community, relationships and networks.
Invest like it's 1776 - and who knows, maybe
you'll make some money while you're at it.

elcome Week 2.0 has
come and gone. And
now like most Univer-
sity of Michigan
students, all my
work has man-
aged to pile up,
and the stress
has too. It's
sad to say, but
I experienced,
shortness of ZOE
breath as I
walked to the STAHL
Law Library
this morning.
I kept repeating, "Woe is me!" in
my head as I braced myself for
the upcoming week. And this isn't
my attempt at some Woody Allen
schtick - some kind of blind neu-
roticism. It's the truth, pure and
simple.
So before I sat down to write this,
I attempted to snap out of this dis-
gustingly self-indulgent state and
took 25 minutes out of my work-
filled Sunday to listen to David Fos-
ter Wallace's commencement speech
at Kenyon College from May 2005.
Unlike many other commencement
speeches, Wallace managed to go
beyond the usual graduation cli-
ches. Instead, he reminded the audi-
ence how hard and important it is
to "(get) free of (our) natural, hard-
wired default setting, which is to be
deeply and literally self-centered"
so that we have the mental space to
actually "care about other people."
Crazy thought, eh? And you know
what - to my high-school self, it
sure was. I remember reading Wal-
lace's speech at my dad's suggestion.
But as a stressed student with limit-
ed perspective (things don't seem to
change), I don't think I really picked
up on the lessons my dad (or Wal-

lace) was tryingto teach me.
I read it again for the second time
this past fall, but I've been putting
off writing or even thinking about
it. I've been afraid that my musings
would never be appropriately intel-
ligent or thoughtful, but this fear
has only delayed the need to fully
process it.
His speech has defined my year.
After reading Wallace's words this
fall, I listened to his delivery on
YouTube. Afterward, I began read-
ing up on Wallace - articles about
his personal life, work and his even-
tual suicide. However, my involve-
ment went beyond basic Internet
research; Wallace now seems to
creep up everywhere (and not just
in some blog's suggestion to be the
ghost of Wallace for Halloween).
When I attended a meditation ses-
sion, Wallace's words were re-iter-
ated - the importance of not letting
experiences out of your control
upset you. As I washed dishes with
my roommate with whom I shared
the speech, we discussed the impor-
tance of context in understanding
individuals. Having used his own
instructions about understanding
and appreciation in our perception
of him, we applauded ourselves on
being "so DFW!" (Having read, lis-
tened to and experienced the speech
as many times as I now have, I feel
that we're on an initials-basis.)
But, why now? Why did his advice
that "(deciding) how you're gonna
try to see it ... so that it will actually
be within your power to experience
a crowded, hot, slowtype situation as
not only meaningful, but sacred ... "
resonate now? I've read his speech
before, but only now did I internal-
ize it. Partly, it was the realization
that Wallace makes brilliant ideas
accessible. He was not "presenting

himself as the wise, older fish." He
personalized these struggles.
A little humor and
self-mockery can go
a long way.
Butmainly,myinternalizingofhis
speech was a testament to the power
of humor. I laughed at his delivery
of "What the hell is water?" and at
the punch line to the story about the
atheist and the believer. Laughing
made his speech more palatable. By
not taking himself too seriously, his
messages did not become what he
calls "banal platitudes." Wallace's
speech, packed with intellectual
ideas, clever observations and valu-
able lessons, can feel dense at times.
However, these moments - these
pauses - provide the time and space
needed to fully digest his (at times
preachy, but enlightening) advice.
His delivery also took the bit-
terness out of the descriptions of
the "soul-killing muzak" in the
supermarket or the cash register's
"have a nice day" as the "absolute
voice of death" and injected them
with humor. On the page, his cri-
tiques can appear angry, limiting
the potential contagion of these
compelling ideas. However, once
infused with humor, these con-
cepts, no longer dampened by
anger,ringthat much more "capital-
T True." Only to prove and remind
me that a little laughter, a little
self-mockery and little less self-
importance can go along, long way.

TV/NEW MEDIA COLUMN
'House of
Cards' spurs
innovation

FILM REVIEW
Infectious 'Side Effects'

ver the past couple
weeks, I've been divid-
ing my friends into two
groups: those who have seen all
of "House of Cards," and those
who haven't.
Netflix's
latest attempt
to break into
the original
content busi-
ness, "House
of Cards,"
stars Kevin KAYLA
Spacey, UPADHYAYA
and is cre-
ated by David
Fincher, setting it apart from the
niche of to-fi web series. In fact,
the streaming company poured
a sizable amount of capital into
the project: $100 million for
two 13-episode seasons. That's
not pet-project funding; it's an
investment.
And Netflix decided to go all
in, releasing all 13 episodes at
once instead of spacing them
out over a traditional weekly
schedule. In doing so, Netflix
fully embraces the growing
binge-watching trend, which
emerged at the advent of TV on
DVD and exploded once DVRs
and online streaming services
entered the picture. You can
watch all of "The Sopranos" in
a matter of weeks if you want.
That's pretty magical - if not
insane.
"It doesn't make sense for
Netflix to be making its own
content," my housemate said
when she walked in on me
watching my fifth consecutive
episode of "Cards."
To a certain extent, she
might be right. But, once upon a
time, people said the same thing
about the network then known
as American Movie Classics.
What business did a channel
intended to bring film classics
to your home television have
making its own programming?
In 2006, network president Ed
Carroll started looking for a
way to expand, leading to "Bro-
ken Trail," a Western minise-
ries built with AMC's audience
in mind. "Broken Trail" wasn't
an overwhelming success, but it
got AMC into the original con-
tent game, and now the network
boasts "Mad Men" and "Break-
ing Bad" - two of the decade's
defining series.
Netflix is after the same kind
of rebranding. As explained
by its chief content officer Ted
Sarandos in GQ, the ultimate
goal is "to become HBO faster
than HBO can become us."
Cable is the reason we're
living in what many call the
"Golden Age of television." Due
to basic economics, the film
industry has become increas-
ingly reliant on franchises. Sony
didn't reboot the "Spider-Man"
franchise so quickly to redeem
the many missteps of "Spider-
Man 3"; it just needed to hold
the rights to the character,
and releasing an undercooked
retcon was all it took. The only
explanation you'll ever get for
this year's "Fast & Furious 6"
has Ben Franklin's face plas-
tered all over it. As the box
office melted into an amalga-
mation of sequels, prequels,
reboots and reimaginations,
television became the true cen-
ter for entertainment innova-
tion.

That's not to say that the tele-
vision industry isn't similarly
guided by where the money is,
but in recent years - especially
with the introduction of pay-
cable - TV has consistently
remained in the business of sto-
rytelling. With its distinct set of
properties, HBO spurred inno-
vation on TV: Because the net-
work makes the same amount
of money whether its subscrib-
ers tune in or not, it could take
on niche programming that
didn't have to pull huge num-
bers. The starting point of TV's
Golden Age varies depending
on whom you're talking to, but
most go with "The Sopranos"
or its lesser-known predeces-

sor "Oz," both of which belong
to the HBO arsenal of critically
acclaimed masterpieces.
The other two premium
channels, Starz and Showtime,
followed suit. And while basic
cable networks like FX and
AMC continue to rely on alver-
tising and ratings, they still
allow for a whole lot of creative
freedom. With "Mad Men,"
AMC proved that you don't nec-
essarily need a huge audience
to keep a show afloat: You just
need an intensely captive one.
And yet, cable is a slowly
dying industry. Sure, its busi-
ness model has led to a surge
in high-quality content as net-
works vie for viewer loyalty,
and the number of cable users
who pull the plug on their ser-
vices is relatively low, but it's
getting harder and harder to
hook new users. How many
friends do you have with cable?
I don't even have cable in my
house, and television is my
life (I lost a long and heated
battle with my housemates on
that one). But the low monthly
payments and ease of online
services like Netflix and Hulu+
make very enticing alternatives
to cable bills.
Even with the cable indus-
try's decline, becoming the
HBO of online content is a lofty
goal - one I don't anticipate
Netflix achieving anytime soon.
Because, as excited as I am
about "House of Cards," the
quality just isn't quite there.
The production value is stun-
ning; it's essentially a 13-hour
Fincher film, with gorgeous,
isolating shots. But it's far from
"Sopranos" or "Mad Men" when
it comes to its characters, and
the show takes few risks with
storytelling. In the end, there's
little making me watch episode
after episode in a row, other
than the fact that I can, and
that autoplay exists and that
100-page reading on political
polling strategies can wait until
morning,
Netflix versus
HBO.
I love a political thriller full
of morally depraved schem-
ers, and Kate Mara is quickly
becoming one of my favorite TV
ladies, but what has me most
excited about "Cards" isn't its
story - which can be laughably
over-the-top - but the innova-
tion and creative potential it
builds on and opens up.
Releasing all the episodes
at once impacts the show's
quality - many of the issues I
have with it are likely a result
of the series being created in a
vacuum: Without feedback, the
problems persist. But it's a cre-
ative risk, and it allows viewers
to watch at any pace they please
(AV Club's Todd Vanderwerff
thinks the idea of watching
all of "Cards" in one sitting is
insane, and, hey, that's fine - he
can finish it in June if he wants).
Only time will tell if "Cards"
is a worthy investment for
Netflix on the economic side
of things (Vanderwerff has his
doubts about this, too). But, for
now, I view Netflix's move as

another way to widen the pool
for super-high quality TV pro-
gramming. It's a display of the
television industry's ability to
embrace changing trends in the
way we receive our entertain-
ment.
And "Cards" is just the first
hand, a starting point much like
"Broken Trails" was for AMC.
Netflix could work out the kinks
and come back with the next
"Sopranos." But, for now, in
the Great Battle of the Content
Companies, I'll keep my money
on HBO.

Scott"Burns injects
Soderbergh film
with poetic script
By ANDREW MCCLURE
Daily Arts Writer
Everyone should try drugs.
Drugs allow the brain to extehd
the truth into foreign territory.
And that for-
eign territory A
fosters learn-
ing. Learning Side Effects
leads to growth.A
Growth, if At Quaityl6
you're smart, and Rave

actualization.
Caveat: Abuse
of said drugs nullifies the afore-
mentioned cycle. "Side Effects"
centralizes its plot around drugs
- prescription drugs. Expectedly,
it delves into athematic Marianas
Trench of dense deception, insu-
lar insecurities and faux fantasies.
A didactic yet engrossing picture,
the viewing effects aren't "Side"
at all - they're inches from your
face; you just opt not to see them.
Even though director Steven
Soderbergh is a member of the
Sundance Kids and integral in
the vanguard of indie-American
filmmakers, he's not an auteur
(think: Paul Thomas Anderson,
"The Master" and Wes Anderson,
"Moonrise Kingdom"). And that's
OK.
His films suggest maybe, at
one point, he fancied the idea of
becoming an auteur but ultimate-
ly decided it'd be too redundant.

Instead, he continually makes
ace movies without ditching his
trademarks: ambient scores mar-
rying sudden jump cuts, all while
lensing himself under a pseud-
onym. Bravo.
Emily (Rooney Mara, "The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo")
and Martin (Channing Tatum,
"Magic Mike") live a posh, NYC
lifestyle - until Martin gets
thrown behind bars for insider
trading. Time elapses. Martin is
released from prison to his seem-
ingly cathartic spouse. (Opera-
tive word: seemingly.) Turns out,
Emily obscures her deep-rooted
emotional jungle. Martin knows
it, her mother knows it and her
former shrinks know it: She hasn't
been happy for a long time.
An accident introduces the
next most important figure, Dr.
Banks (Jude Law, "Anna Kareni-
na"), Emily's new psychiatrist. He
prescribes her the usual: Zoloft.
Things go awry. Hallucinations,
hypnosis and other bizarre side
effects manifest themselves. Liti-
gation rears its ugly head when a
nasty murder interrupts finally-
reunited lovers and a doctor's
morally-loose medicinal research.
"Rooney! Rooney! Rooney!"
the filmic football stadium shall
chant. Mara is plain different from
her contemporaries. She doesn't
act, she communicates. There's a
delightful sense of effortlessness
in her cool, monotone utterance.
Doubtlessly, in "Side Effects," she
goes batshit-crazy, which con-
vinces viewers of her ability to
whisper, then seamlessly scream.
We want to trust her, but she's
too convincingly untrustworthy.

OPEN ROAD
"Just one more episode of 'House of Cards."

Mara is here to stay. Any opposi-
tion?
Tatum satisfies for his 15 min-
utes of screen time. Law brings
down the house as the resilient,
semi-crazed doctor cornered in a
bad, bad predicament with a bad
patient. Nobody falls short in "Side
Effects," yet Mara's surrounding
cast enhances her performance.
Pushing each other's boundaries?
Good teamwork, team.
The dialogic beauty takes on a
character itself. Early on, Emily
confesses to Dr. Banks that Mar-
tin "stared at me like I was a
painting." She later describes her
mental weather as "a poisonous
fog." Props go to scriptwriter,
Scott Burns ("Contagion"), for
constructing such poetry.
As mentioned, Soderbergh is
his own Director of Photography.
His rack focuses (when something

out-of-focus becomes in-focus)
and narrow depth of field isolate
Emily from the world, abandon-
ing any sense of humane connec-
tion. Lightning-fast jump cuts,
cut-ins and behind-the-shot Stea-
dicam shots add brisk pacing to
an otherwise slow boiling film.
Every shot makes you think.
"Side Effects" is a textbook
team effort. Scripting, 'editing,
acting and directing all convene
in harmony. A narrator informs
us, "Depression is the inability
to see your future self." The film
hints at the facades drugs create
for their users or abusers - an
idea that everything will be fine
as long as you swallow me twice
a day. "Effects" doesn't believe
in probabilities. You either do
it or you don't. The gray area in
between causes the unwanted
side effects.

Fans of "Grey's Anatomy" should
realize that Kelly ripped this off
directly from the ABC series. In
the pilot episode of that medical

hospital aren't allowed to make
mistakes when presented with
rare medical cases.
The series also seems unsure
of what kind of medical drama
it wants to be. On the one hand,
a "Grey's Anatomy"-type show
is unapologetically soapy: Doc-
tors move from one to the other,
having sex in on-call rooms and
arguing about their personal
lives over open patients in the
O.R. On the other hand, "House"
and "ER" are more medically
focused. "Monday Mornings" is
in its own world, struggling to
find any kind of balance.
The existence 'of this show
is downright perplexing, par-
ticularly because it does noth-
ing worthwhile in the entire
first episode. Much like the
characters, the show has zero
redeeming qualities and the pilot
doesn't even graze the surface of
compelling drama or thought-
provoking characters. Without a
doubt, "Monday Mornings" will
eventually end up the victim of a
Monday morning meeting itself,
with a TNT executive having to
answer for this colossal failure.

Is that rib sauce or blood?
Cable-quality 'Cards'
deals Netflix a winner

By SAM CENZHANG
Daily Arts Writer
"House of Cards" has the
sort of pedigree that puts the
audience on notice. The show
makes no pre-
tense that it's
anything other
than a star House of
vehicle for two- Cards
time Academy
Award winner Netflix
Kevin Spacey
("American
Beauty"). When the credits
roll, the cinematically shot and
frenetically plotted "House of
Cards" feels like something
much bigger than television.
Of course, "House of Cards"
isn't exactly television. Netflix is
transforming from content plat-
form to content producer, and
its evolution doesn't start small.
For one, every episode of "House
of Cards" is available, right now.
It's an obvious prestige project,,
starring an established movie
star in Spacey, who's sure to gar-
ner serious consideration for an
Emmy. In today's ludicrously
crowded field of Best Leading
Actor in a w candidates, that's
praise about as high as possible
for the credibility Spacey brings
to any project.
Spacey completely dominates
the first two episodes by virtue
of screen time - sheer pres-

ence and the particularities
in the show's storytelling. He
commands the screen as Fran-
cis Underwood, House Major-
ity Whip and Representative
from Gaffney, S.C. Not only that,
he also directly addresses the
audience, which by itself is not
at all innovative. Indeed, the
show isn't even the first whose
title starts with "House of" to
employ 'a protagonist-narrator
played by an Academy Award
nominee. (That dubious dis-
tinction belongs to Showtime's
disappointing "House of Lies"
and Don Cheadle.) However,
the device, as worn-out as it has
seemingly become, suits "House
of Cards" and its star perfectly.
The dialogue is overwrought,
appropriately so for such a mas-
ter of ham as Kevin Spacey.
There are moments, though,
when it threatens to veer from
overliterate into unlistenable.
The first two episodes are filled
to bursting with exposition,
plotlines and characters, all of
which seem to demand a sub-
stantial amount of screen time.
When the camera centers on
Spacey, and the rest of the world
drops away in the moments
when Spacey breaks the fourth
wall, the show and Spacey are
given room to breathe. Lines
that threaten to become corny
are instead delivered lightly,
with a wink, and we become

complicit in the joke and are fur-
ther drawn into Frank Under-
wood's web. The arch glance
to the camera trademarked by
"The Office" 's John Krasinski
has never served a more crucial
pacing and structural role.
David Fincher ("Zodiac")
was hired to be David Fincher,
and these first two episodes
are very David Fincher indeed.
There are too many examples of
directorial pyrotechnics to list,
from shots outside the Rayburn
building to a scene inside a dirty
hovel. When it comes down to
it, Fincher is one of the preemi-
nent directors of his generation,
and his directorial work here is
exemplary. Unfortunately, his
directorial involvement with
the show ends with the second
episode, so there is at least some
concern that this may be the
visual high point of the entire
series's run.
A 13-hour
Fincher film
you can watch
on your laptop.
Fincher's ascension to the
ivory tower of executive pro-
duction, however, won't damage
the show irrevocably. Any show
would be better off with Fincher
calling the shots, but the nar-
rative momentum created by
the first episodes isn't merely a
function of masterful direction.
Despite the inevitable pacing
hiccups created by an overload
of storylines, Kate Mara ("Dead-
fall"), Robin Wright ("Enlight-
ened") and Kristen Connolly
('The Cabin in the Woods") all
deliver excellent undercard (as
it were) performances, and they
are the biggest draws outside of
the event horizon that is Spac-
ey's presence.
Though Netflix provides a
unique delivery system for the
show, "House of Cards" by no
means revolutionizes the form
of serialized drama, even though
there's no weekly wait for the
next fix. It hits all the notes one
would expect from a season-
long production, despite being
made available like a 13-hour
film. Every episode is comprised
of small problems that are
solved and fit into a larger tap-
estry, slowly'unraveling over the
course of a season. Anyone who
has ever watched television will
know exactly what this is like;
"House of Cards" is essentially
a glorified procedural. Despite
that, the show is compulsively
watchable, exquisitely shot and
deftly balances restraint and
melodrama. Reports of weekend
binges through all 13 episodes
are quite common, and that's
really all the endorsement you
need.

die of January.
Still, it wasn't until this week
that Osborn made the decision
not to run with youMICH.
youMICH nearly won the
presidential election last year,
handily won a plurality of seats
in the assembly and is the only
active party from last year's elec-
tion. Osborn noted that running
with youMICH would have been
an easier path to victory than
trying to run an entire party
in opposition, but he said ideo-
logical differences outweighed
increased political security.
In particular, Osborn said
forUM will hold open meetings
every week as well as closed
meetings for its executive board.
"We want to make it as open
and transparent as possible,
and that was something I didn't
necessarily see with youMICH
either," he said.
Osborn added that youMICH

conference."
Agusiobo said the African
community in the business
school is tight-knit, which she
attributes in part to the club's
efforts.
The event was successful,
though only about 100 of the 150
registered guests were in atten-
dance due to complications with
the weather. She also said the
clubhopes to make this anannual
event and will continue to inform
people about the potential Africa
has as a business power, as well
as the options available for Afri-
cans studying business abroad.
Rackham student Wil
Asumeng, the club's vice presi-
dent of finance and corporate

can be "somewhat exclusive,"
which he didn't necessarily sup-
port.
"If you weren't in the party,
it was kind of (like), 'Okay, too
bad,"' he said. "It was behind
closed doors."
One platform idea from forUM
is to update Mcards to include
information like allergies, blood
type and other medical infor-
mation and to make those cards
compatible with the University
Health System. Osborn said it
could eliminate paperwork for
students.
"So that when you walk into
UHS it's more of like a check-in
system," Osborn said. "It's more
efficient; it's more convenient for
students too. There's no reason
that students should have to go
and fill out the same paperwork
every single time they want to go
to UHS."
Lane added that if it's possible
for your Mcard to act as an ATM
card for TCF bank, it should have
other purposes too.
Another platform point is

making healthy food more avail-
able around campus. Lane and
Osborn pointed to the difficulty
students have finding fresh food
at available prices if they don't
have cars.
"We like our ideas; we think
our ideas are pretty good, but
they're just our ideas," Osborn
said. "We want to hear all the
rest of the students."
LSA junior Laurel Ruza, you-
MICH chair, said youMICH is
still looking for a presidential
candidate.
"We definitely wish (Osborn)
all the best, and we're just pre-
paring to move forward with
a new candidate whose vision
of student government better
aligns with youMICH's goals of
an open, diverse and collabora-
tive student government."
She declined to comment fur-
ther on youMICH's candidate
selection.

Gilgenbach said in an inter-

would center on the disposal of
nuclear waste, which tops public
concerns.
"We have solved those problems

Several audience members
asked about nuclear plant safety,
particularly following incidents
like the one that occurred in Fuk-

in 2011. NRC Deputy Regional

said the NRC made immediate
responses following that disas-

plants respond to incidents.

In discussing what can be done
to improve plant safety, Annalisa
Manera, an associate professor in
Engineering, pointed out that Gen-

passive safety features like gravi-
ty-driven cooling systems, will be
available by 2030. Most current
reactors are GenerationII.

he was disappointed at research-

"They're designed to bring art to

In addition, a lack of public

art from being erected through-
out the city. The AAPAC has also
begun preliminary discussions
for a collaborative project in 2014
at the Argo Canoe Livery and sev-

of which would be privately fund-

relations, said he was mainly
involved in fundraising for the
event.
"The focus of the event was
to give presence to the Afri-
can community, especially in
the business school," Asumeng
said. "Even though it's a young
organization, we felt this was a
good time to have a conference
to give people from Africa the
time to come and speak because
usually people know very little
about Africa outside of the
media."
Asumeng agreed that the
turnout and interest level were
"promising" for the group, and
that the success of the event
shows the potential for a thriv-
ing African community within
the larger academic one.
Though most in attendance
were graduate students, LSA
freshman Eberechi Ogbuaku
came out for the event at the

recommendation of her African
Studies advisor.
"I'm Nigerian myself, so when
there's a conference about Afri-
cans and trying to build com-
munity, that always interests
me," she said. "It's something
that needs to take place, so I was
interested in hearing other peo-
ple talk about how we can build
that community stronger and
energize it, as the conference's
goal is."
Ogbuaku said she 'feels more
informed, but that the time it will
take to see actual progress being
made is "frustrating."
"It's going to take time to see
the actual growth happen, you
have to do it in steps," Ogbuaku
said. "I'm definitely more inter-
ested in the business side than
the law making side, but it's not
about pointing fingers, it's about
making progress as a united

ment of Energy, and said, as cli-
ents, the two institutions have
more similarities than differ-
ences.
"There's a real confidence in
the missions," Lynch said. "The
University, of Michigan has a
really impressive research mis-
sion. The Department of Energy
is a huge funding vehicle for labs
and for universities across the
country."
Originally from Binghamton,
N.Y., Lynch remembers his par-
ents' friends' anecdotes of cross
examining in trials as being a
catalyst in his interest in the law
- he saw it as both academically
perplexing and a fantastic way to
institute social change. He com-
pleted his Bachelor of Arts from
the University of Rochester in
1990 and his law degree from the
Georgetown University Law Cen-
ter in 1995.
Lynch's career is centered on
the public sphere. After clerk-
ing in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit in 1995, he
worked at litigation boutique
Shea & Gardner. Lynch then
was an assistant U.S. attorney in
Washington D.C. before becom-
ing an assistant chief litigation
counsel at the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commissions until
2010, when he joined the Depart-
ment of Energy.
In his work at the department,
Lynch said working on issues like
renewable energy and nuclear
nonproliferation issues was an
honor.
"The energy department ... was
an extraordinarily exciting place
to be, and it was really wonder-
ful being part of that mission and
going to work every day in-order
to bring to fruition the ideas that
(Secretary of Energy Steven Chu)

had."
He said the University allows
him to do the exciting work he
did at the Department of Energy
with "the added benefit of being
an amazing institution that is
educating some of the very best
students in the world."
"I was looking for oppor-
tunities for a place that had a
very public-spirited science and
research mission, and I saw that
the University of Michigan would
be a wonderful opportunity to do
the work that I love for a client
that has a very similar values and
goals," Lynch said.
Only residing in Ann Arbor for
a month, he's already adopted the
city's cerebral character over the
fast-paced nature of the capital.
"In Washington.D.C., everyone
focuses on the politics, everyone
knows who's going to appear on
the Sunday talk shows and that is
something that people find inter-
esting to talk about," Lynch said.
"I didn't. Here, people care about
politics, people are very political-
ly involved, but there's also such a
wonderful cultural and intellec-
tual environment that I've really
come to love in the short time I've
been here."
He looks forward to his wife,
Lisa, and their three children
joining him in Ann Arbor this
July.
In D.C., Lynch was a lecturer at
the University of Virginia School
of Law from 2007 to 2012 and an
adjunct professor at the George-
town University Law Center from
2008 to 2012. He said he found
his experiences in the classroom
enriching.
"Every year I would learn
something new from the stu-
'dents," Lynch said. "I would have
these wonderful epiphanies in
class."
He added that it would be an
honor to teach at the University
Law School once he has adjusted

to his new occupation.
Leonard Niehoff, University
Law School adjunct professor,
said the University's Office of
the Vice President and General
Counsel has great significance
in influencing higher education
law.
"Throughout its long history,
the University has worked to pro-
tect the independence that the
Michigan Constitution wisely
affords it," Niehoff said, calling
the school's leadership role "sec-
ond to none."
Niehoff, who has been in pri-
vate practice in Michigan for
nearly three decades and worked
with nine general counsels, said
the breadth of issues the office
must review is common only to
large, public research institu-
tions.
"The University of Michigan is
a city," Niehoff said "It has roads,
a security force, buildings, parks
and recreational facilities ... just
about every kind of regulated
enterprise or industry exists on
the campus."
The University's legal offices
have always contended with
national issues. He foresees the
University will experience cases
related to health care regulation
and donor agreements as higher
education becomes more expen-
sive.
"To some degree, it's very hard
to predict," Niehoff said. "It ends
up being a mirror of what else
society is dealing. The University
has to be a leader, and it has con-
sistently played that role."
Barely a month into his role,
Lynch anticipates serving the
University to the greatest of his
abilities.
"This is just one of those cli-
ents for a lawyer where you can
just come to work every day really
fully believing in the mission of
the client and wanting at your
core to help the client succeed."

HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP)
- A tornado tore through Hat-
tiesburg on Sunday as part of
a wave of severe storms that
downed trees, damaged build-
ings and injured more than a
dozen people.
The twister traveled down
one of Hattiesburg's main
streets and mangled homes,
commercial buildings and struc-
tures on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Southern Mississippi.
Emergency officials said at least
10 people were injured in sur-
rounding Forrest County and
three were hurt to the west in
Marion County, but they weren't
aware of any deaths.
Mississippi Emergency Man-
agement Agencyspokesman Greg
Flynn said it appears that a single
tornado caused the damage in
those two counties and Lamar
County. Hundreds of homes are
damaged in Forrest County, along
with a couple dozen in the other
two. Gov. Phil Bryant declared a
state of emergency.
Flynn said the sheer scope of
the damage was slowing their
assessment.
"The problemis,itwassostrong
that there's so much debris that
there's a lot of areas they haven't
been able to get to yet," he said.

On the campus of the univer-
sity, trees were snapped inahalf
around the heavily damaged
Alumni House where part of
the roof was ripped away. Win-
dows in anearby building were
blown out, and heavy equipment
worked to clear streets nearbyin
a heavy rain after the worst of
the weather had passed.
The university released a
statement saying no one was
hurt but that it was under a state
of emergency, anyone away from
campus should stay away until
further notice.
East of campus, 47-year-old
Cindy Bullock was at home with
her husband and dog, a terrier
mix named Vinnie, when she
heard the tornado coming. They
ran to a hallway and covered
their heads. It wasn't long before
the windows in the kitchen and
bedroom exploded. The storm
stripped all the shingles off the
roof and left holes in it, while
knocking over a large pine tree
in the yard.
After dark, the Bullocks were
trying to arrange their stuff
inside so it wouldn't get wet
from the dripping water.
"I just looked out the win-
dow and I heard the rumbling.
It sounded like a train. We ran
to the hall, and the kitchen win-
dows and the windows in the
bedroom exploded. It happened
pretty fast," she said.
There were large trees block-
ing the road all through her

neighborhood, and several of the
houses were hit by falling trees.
Her friend was staying with
them after the friend's apart-
ment took a direct hit from a
falling tree.
ForrestCounty Sheriff Billy
McGee says 10 or 15 people
were injured by the tornado that
slammed Hattiesburg and other
parts of the county - but none of
the injuries was serious.
He says, "Most of our injuries
have been walking wounded."
To the west, Marion County
emergency director Aaron Greer
says three injuries have been
reported in the community of
Pickwick, about seven miles
south of Columbia. He says two
people were taken to hospitals,
but the third didn't have the
injury examined.
Greer says one mobile home
was destroyed, three other
structures have major damage
and several have minor damage.
Bryant plans to go to Hatties-
burg on Monday to check out
damage in the city and at USM,
his almamater, spokesman Mick
Bullock said.
On Sunday night, John and
Katherine Adams were cleaning
up around their one-story white
house where the storm punched
holes in the roof, busted win-
dows and completely destroyed
the back porch.,The couple was
at home with their 7- and 3-year-
old daughters when the tornado
passed next to their house.

Muslim
makes Israeli
football debut

Campus researches gun solutions

Demonstrations by
violent fans leading
up to appearance
JERUSALEM (AP) - Under
heavy security, a Muslim foot-
ball player whose signing with
a Jerusalem club sparked a
violent uprising by a hardcore
group of racist fans made his
much anticipated debut Sunday
to a rousing ovation.
Hundreds of police deployed
around Beitar Jerusalem's sta-
dium, two days after a suspi-
cious fire believed to be set by
angry fans destroyed the team's.
main offices.
Tensions remained high as
the team faced off against Bnei
Sakhnin, an Arab team whose
fans have clashed before with
Beitar's. But the thousands of
fans and foes who flooded to
Teddy Stadium presented a
show of strength against a ris-
ing tide of racism among Israeli
soccer fans.
"I came today to show that
not all Beitar fans are punks
and racists," said Yair Sina, a
49-year-old lifelong Beitar fan.
"I won't let them take away my
love for the team,"
The fire, which destroyed
historic trophies and memen-
tos, marked the height of a
violent campaign by fans upset
with the team for signing two
Muslim players from Chechnya.
But in contrast to the previ-
ous taunts and jeers directed at
the players, the crowd of thou-
sands erupted into a rousing
standing ovation when Gabriel
Kadiev, a 19-year-old defender

recently brought over from FC
Terek Grozny, entered the game
in the 80th minute. Every time
he touched the ball the crowd
cheered wildly, mostly.drown-
ing out a smattering of boos.
The trend continued when a
few minutes later Beiter scored
a late goal to secure a 2-2 tie.
Kadiev's Chechen teammate,
23-year-old Zaur Sadayev, was
injured and not included in the
team lineup.
The goodwill was felt
throughout the stadium with
banners reading "Violence and
racism? Not on our field" and
fliers explaining the sensitivity
of the game and beseeching the
fans to behave.
Police spokesman Micky
Rosenfeld said more than 500
policemen were deployed inside
and outside the stadium to
prevent disturbances. Officers
were on horseback and others
escorted the Sakhnin players
into the field to make sure they
were safe.
"It is now clear to any rea-
sonable person in the country
where racism can lead. I came
here to strengthen Beitar in
their battle against racism,"
said Jerusalem Mayor Nir Bar-
kat, one of several dignitaries
at the game. "This is a historic
process and it is clear that what
was once cannot be again."
Beitar has long tried to con-
tain a tightly knit fan group
called "La Familia" whose
behavior has had the team
docked points and forced it to
play before empty stadiums.
The group is routinely abusive
toward opposing players, taunt-
ing them with racist and anti-
Arab chants.

Mass. college
inspires renewed
focus on firearms
BOSTON (AP) - On a Friday
afternoon in December, Lee Pel-
ton was driving home with his
13-year-old daughter in the pas-
senger seat when radio reports
of the Newtown school massa-
cre forced him over to side of the
road.
"I held her hand as we listened
...and we both cried,"said Pelton,
the president of Boston's Emer-
son College. "We're both strug-
gling with how could this have
happened, why it happened?
Those are the things we talked
about. We didn't have answers.
But I knew at that moment I was
going to do something."
Overnight, the answer of just

what to do began to crystallize.
The next day, Pelton sent a long
email to all of the college's 4,500
students and 1,500 faculty and
staff. Together they would "seek
to make sense of the senseless,"
he wrote, by launching a prob-
ing discussion of gun violence
in which all sides would listen
to one another and search for
solutions. The unresolved ques-
tion: Given the fierce divide and
raw emotions that surround the
debate over guns, is that kind of
conversation even possible?
Pelton decided it wasn't
enough to search for the answer
at his college alone. He wrote an
open letter to President Barack
Obama and more than 280 other
university and college presidents
signed on, pledging to launch
debate about the issues sur-
rounding guns ontheir own cam-
puses.

That discussion in higher edu-
cation had already begun, and
has only grown. Pelton's letter
went out about the same time as
another, penned by the president
of Atlanta's Oglethorpe University
and signed by leaders of morethan
370 colleges. That letter urges
lawmakers to oppose legislation
allowing guns on campuses, close
a loophole allowing some gun
sales withouta background check,
reinstate a ban on military-style
weapons and require safety stan-
dards for guns.
Institutions including Bethany
College in West Virginia, whose
president signed both letters, and
BrownUniversityin Rhode Island,
whichis actingonitsown, saythey
are planning forums on gun vio-
lence later this semester. Ogletho-
rpe President Lawrence Schall
said he plans to deliver a speech
on his campus this month about

the need for college presidents
to speak out on important issues,
highlighted by the focus on com-
batting gun violence.
Pelton, who acknowledges his
own strong views on gun control,
says he expectedaskepticism.
Many American colleges and
universities are regarded; par-
ticularly by conservative critics,
as centers of left-leaning views.
And students and professors at
Emerson, facing Boston Com-
mon and just down the hill from
the gold dome of Massachusetts'
capitol, routinely describe it as a
decidedly liberal institution. It
sits in a strongly left-leaning city,
in the state that gave the nation
the Kennedys, was the only one
of 50 whose voters backed George
McGovern's quixotic 1972 run for
president, and already is home to
some of the nation's strictest
gun laws.

Reveling continues
after bullets
wounded four
Friday
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -
Gunshots erupted in a crowd of
bead-wearing, drink-carrying
late-night revelers on Bourbon
Street during the countdown
to Mardi Gras, wounding four
people and sending bystanders
running and screaming. Hours
later on Sunday, though, the
same stretch was packed with
partiers who said they weren't
letting the violence dampen
their fun.
In a video taken by a witness
Saturday night and released
the next day, the shootings are
preceded by footage of people
standing shoulder to shoulder
in New Orleans' famed tour-
ist district, with some holding
green plastic cups and wear-
ing gaudy hats or masks. A sec-
tion of the frame highlighted
by police shows people jos-
tling and speaking with angry
expressions.
Police said in an email that
the video depicts an argument
involving one of the shoot-
ing victims and the suspects.
Two men are seen leaving the
argument and returning with
a third, then approaching the
victim as at least one of the sus-
pects begins shooting, accord-
ing to police. Four shots are
heard in rapid succession, fol-
lowedby screams as some in the
crowd stagger into one another
and a nearby wall. A man whom
police identified as one of the
suspects is shown walking
through the crowd with his arm
extended as the gunshots are
heard, though it's difficult to
make outa weapon.
Police said Sunday that they
were seeking the three men
and that they've identified one
suspect, but won't release the

name.
The shootings wounded
two men and two women,
three of whom were treated
and released Sunday. One man
hit in the abdomen, thigh and
pelvis was in stable condition
Sunday after surgery the previ-
ous night, New Orleans Police
spokesman Hilal Williams said.
Another man was shot in the
buttocks, one woman was shot
on the chin and right foot, and
the second woman was shot on
the toe, police said. No ages or
names were released.
The shooting came on the-
last weekend of partying before
Mardi Gras, the Fat Tuesday
celebration that is the signature
tourist event of the year in New
Orleans. And for thousands, the
partying continued despite the
shooting. Parades rolled under
cloudy skies Sunday before
crowds of onlookers, though the
shootings were on the minds of
some revelers.
"It was very disappoint-
ing," said New Orleans resi-
dent Carol Redmann-Bailey as
she watched Thoth roll by. "I
was disappointed and sad, but
it seems like Bourbon Street
stayed open. ... Let the good
times roll."
New Orleans has been
plagued for years by violent
crime, including gun violence
that has soared since Hurricane
Katrina devastated the city in
2005.
In 2011, sixteen people were
shot and at least two killed in
Halloween shootings in New
Orleans. One of the victims
was slain near the Chris Owens
nightclub, about a block away
from Saturday's incident.
Patrick Clay, a 21-year-old
Louisiana State University stu-
dent, told The Times-Picayune
that he was standing on the cor-
ner of Bourbon Street on Satur-
day night when suddenly he saw
a crowd running and people
screaming that there had been
a shooting.

On a 40-foot prayer,
Wisconsin forces overtime and

'HOUSE

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
MADISON - The game was destined to be played
at a slow pace, not decided by a 40-foot desperation
heave. It was Wisconsin after all, the team known
for using the shot clock more than any other in the
Big Ten, and it was the Kohl Center, where the refer-
ees are known for letting teams play. Plus, the Michi-
gan basketball team has struggled to come out with
energy in its road contests, and the 11 a.m. central
time start wouldn't help. MICHIGAN 73
Even with sophomore point INDIANA 81
guard Trey Burke willing No.
3 Michigan to push the ball,
freshman forward Mitch McGary shooting rarely
seen transition jumpers, and rarely-used redshirt
freshman forward Max Bielfeldt registering a career
high in minutes, the Wolverines couldn't pull it out.
It took a desperation 40-foot shot from Wisconsin,
but Michigan fell, 65-62, on the road, in a game that
would've likely put it back as the No. 1 overall team
in the country.
Wisconsin (8-3 Big Ten, 17-7 overall) has an offen-

sive style that relies on the predictable, but a crazy,
unpredictable last minute of the game was needed
to keep the Wolverines (8-3, 21-3) from getting back
to No.1.
With just over a minute remaining in the game,
Burke made a pull-up jumper around the free-throw
line to put the Wolverines up three. On the other
end, the sophomore tried to take a change to seal the
game, but was called for a blocking foul on a mon-
ster dunk from Wisconsin forward Jared Berggren.
It looked like a charge should have been called on
Berggren, but regardless, he made the free throw to
finish the three-pointplay and tie the game.
"It was a greatdunk," Burke said. "I thought I was
outside the charge area, but sometimes you don't get
those calls. I think that gave them a lot of momen-
tum."
Michigan got the last possession, and it looked
like it would again be Burke to try the game-winner,
as it has been most times this season.
But he passed it off to forward Tim Hardaway Jr.,
who was heavily guarded and couldn't get a clean
look. The junior was still able to sinka deep 3-point-
er with 2.4 seconds left to seemingly win the game
for Michigan, even though Wisconsin coach Bo
Ryan said after the game that Hardaway was prob-
ably fouled on the play.
The Badgers immediately called timeout, and
got the ball back with just enough time to force

The implications o a

hal-cou
MADISON -
There are desperation buzzer-beating
shots, and then there are shots like the
one Wisconsin guard Ben Brust hit on
Saturday to tie the game at the end of regulation
against No. 3 Michigan.
Down three points, the junior had just over
two seconds and the full length of the court go,
down three points. The Wolverines had a foul to
give, so Michigan coach John Beilein instructed
his players to foul. A perfect inbound pass to
Brust left Wolverine fresh-
man guard Caris
LeVert out of posi-
tion to do that.
LeVert
didn't foul.

rt heave
He couldn't have, not without giving Brust a
chance to tie the game by shooting free throws.
It was smarter to contest a running 40-foot
shot. So, on the right side of the court, opposite
the Wisconsin bench, LeVert got in front of the
charging Brust and threw his hands up.
The shot was released from below Brust's hip,
needing a full windup to heave
the ball more than one-third
of the length of the court. It
didn't touch the backboard,
and barely nicked the rim,
but the sound that blasted out
of Wisconsin's Kohl Center
after it went through the net
could've blown the roof off the
building. EVERETT
There was an overtime, COOK
sure, but the Wolverines were
understandably deflated, scor-
ing just two points in the extra frame. The game
ended when Brust hit that prayer of a shot, more
or less.
Call it luck, call it fortune, call it whatev-
er you want - it was a near-impossible
shot that doesn't go in more often
than not.
And that's what's funny
about college basketball,
because just like that,
a desperation heave
completely
changed the
rest of the
season for
Michigan.
Satur-
day wasn't
the best
game Michigan has played this year, not
even close. The Wolverines couldn't shoot, fin-
ishing the game under 40 percent from the floor
and well under 30 percent from three. They
couldn't get to the line, shootinga grand total
of two from the charity stripe on the day, par-
tially because of referees and partially because
nobody besides Burke was driving as much as
usual.
They didn't get contributions from the
majority of the starting lineup. Redshirt
freshman forward Jon Horford, freshman
guard Nik Stauskas and freshman forward
Glenn Robinson combined for 11 points - one
point less than the sixth man, freshman for-
ward Mitch McGary. Burke and junior guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. - the two starters that scored
in double digits - scored a combined 37 points,
more than three times the combined total of the
other three starters.

Where does the hockev teamcio from here?

SOUTH BEND - Red
Berenson's favorite cof-
fee mug, the clear one he
cradles each time he sits down
with reporters outside his office
on the second floor of Yost Ice
Arena, always offers him the
same, pleasant reminder. Black
font shadowed against black cof-
fee: Start every day with a smile.
Berenson may start every day
with a smile, but lately he hasn't
often ended the day with one.
He hasn't found much reason
to smile,
you see. The
73-year-old
head coach
is steering
a Michigan
hockey team
on a crash
course for
rock bot- STEPHEN J.
tom. Or NESBITT
maybe he's
not steering
anymore; maybe he's trying to
regain control of the wheel. It's
hard to tell.
Gazing across the ice at
Compton Family Ice Arena in
South Bend on Friday night
after the Wolverines dropped
a 7-4 contest to Notre Dame,
Berenson wasn't smiling He
wasn't the next night, either,
when Michigan lost again, 6-4
this time.
Despite four games remain-
ing on the schedule, the sweep
in South Bend secured Michi-
gan's first losing, sub-.500
regular season since 1986-87 -
Berenson's third season as head
coach.
This isn't to say Berenson's
program hasn't had pitfalls
before. They just haven't had
them this badly in the last quar-
ter-century. The Wolverines
have earned an NCAA Tourna-
ment berth for 22 consecutive
years - a NCAA-record streak
likely to be shattered this
spring.
Most of the players on Michi-
gan's roster weren't even alive
the last time the Wolverines
didn't make the tournament.
It's hard to fathom that type

Senior forward Kevin Lynch is one of the alternate captains on a team struggling to find leadership.

a

of sustained success. It's even
harder to stomach this collapse.
Berenson has always prided
himself on fielding a roster
packed with two-way forwards
and shutdown defensemen. But
Michigan has allowed 109 goals
(3.63 goals allowed per game)
and has scored just 88 times
(2.93 goals per game).
The Wolverines are a paltry
minus-21 in goal differential.
They were a plus-43 just last
season, and they haven't been a
minus team since 1986-87.
It's hard to find the heart of
the problem. Michigan simply
looked outmatched at times in
South Bend.
It's easy to blame the defense.
Michigan has cycled through
three goaltenders and has had
a defense corps riddled with
injuries and penalties. Miami
(Ohio), the CCHA frontrunner,
has allowed less than half the
number of goals the Wolverines
have allowed.

It's easy to blame the offense.
The three returning 30-plus
point-getters from last season
- Alex Guptill, A.J. Treais and
Lee Moffie - won't come near
that same production, all sit-
ting at or below the 20-point
plateau.
And it's easy to critique these
athletes as we just sit back, but
if I may ... I blame the chemis-
try. I blame the accountability,
which is as important on the ice
as it is through the week.
It's hard to find the leader-
ship on this team. Sure, there
is someone wearing a 'C' and
a few wearing 'A's, but the
accountability that needs to
come from the top down isn't
there. There's no Luke Glenden-
ing outworking his man in the
corner. There's no Carl Hagelin
outracing everyone up the ice.
(It's no coincidence that Glen-
dening and Hagelin are the two
names guaranteed to bring the
rare smile to Berenson's face.)

Most everyone seems as cool
as the head coach behind the
bench.
I think there's no lack of
talent - NIL franchises hold
the rights of nearly half of the
players on the Michigan roster
- but there's alack of selfless-
ness. I think there are players
more concerned with the name
on the back of the jersey than
the 'M' on the front of it. I think
there's no sense of urgency. And
I think there is a flood of talent
ready to slip out of Ann Arbor
after the season, a few minds
already on to their next stage of
hockey career.
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe
that's just me. Prove me wrong.
The simple fact I do know
is this: barring a miracle run
through the CCHA Tourna-
ment, Michigan won't find a
way into the NCAA Tourna-
ment this spring. The Wolver-
ines swept just one team all
season and they have won only

one of 11 true road games this
year, so a lengthy postseason
run seems highly unlikely -
though I'll stop short of saying
it's never gonna happen.
It's not impossible. It's darn
near impossible, but it's not.
quite.
There are some reassur-
ing signs yet, since half of this
roster has the experience of
seeing the mountaintop of col-
lege hockey. Less than two
years ago, these juniors and
seniors were staring blankly
at the white-washed walls of a
locker room inside Xcel Energy
Center in St. Paul, Minn. Their
tear-stained faces told the story
of an overtime game that just
happened to go the other way,
a finish that gave Minnesota-
Duluth the national champion-
ship. These players wiped away
their tears and promised they'd
be back.
Now, for many of them,
they've got one last chance. And

it's nothing like they imagined.
Berenson sat down in the
big, blue chair outside his office
a few weeks back and looked,
around at the reporters in the
room. Holding his favorite mug
in his right hand, he asked if
they were enjoying covering
this team.
They nodded, mostly. In
truth, though, it's been a hard
season to watch. It's been hard
to watch the greatest program
in the land plummet from
invincible to inferior.
How will this chapter close?
It's not written by those report-
ers. It's written by the 26 names
that line the Michigan roster,
the players that carry the pride
of a program and the legacy of
one legendary coach. This end-
ing, for better or worse, is on
them.

SOUTH BEND - As they
have all season, the goals
against the Michigan hockey
team came
in droves MICHIGAN 4
Saturday NOTRE DAME 7
night.
And MICHIGAN 4
just like NOTRE DAME 6
the entire
year, the offense lacked the fire-
power to make up for the poor
defense and goaltending that
continue to plague the Wolver-
ines. They lost 6-4 to close a
weekend sweep during which
they were outscored 13-8.
"It was another tough week-
end," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "I don't know
what to tell you.
"I liked our team tonight; I
thought we hung in there. We
got behind too easily with the
goals against. They were just
not good enough goals to give
up, but the team hung in there
and stayed in the game."
The opening half of Satur-
day's first period was marred
by missed opportunities on the
power play for both teams.
First, with Michigan on the
night's first power play, senior
forward Kevin Lynch skated
through the slot all alone, only
to be stoned by goalie Steve
Summerhays.
After Notre Dame took aturn
on the power play minutes later,
a Fighting Irish 2-on-1 ended in
a whiff on a wide-open net.
But Notre Dame would still
draw first blood at the 12:10
mark of the first period. For-
ward Jeff Costello lowered his
shoulder and drove through
the left circle, firing a shot that
trickled through Michigan

goalie Jared Rutledge's five-
hole. Rutledge started for the
fourth-straight game despite
allowing six goals Friday night
in the Wolverines' defeat.
The period ended with the
Wolverines shorthanded, and
sophomore forward Andrew
Sinelli failing to turn a bounc-
ing puck into an equalizer.
Notre Dame's power play
was given another chance in
the second period when Sinelli
was whistled for cross-check-
ing.
Thirty-eight seconds later, it
became a two-man advantage
for the Fighting Irish as junior
forward Derek DeBlois went off
for roughing.
The Michigan penalty kill
held its ground for nearly the
duration, but with about 20
seconds left on the last man
advantage, forward Anders
Lee scored his third goal of
the weekend after a fortu-
nate bounce to his stick in the
crease.
After killing off yet another
penalty, it was the Wolverine
power-play unit that had the
next opportunity as the two
teams spent much of the sec-
ond period away from even
strength. Sophomore forward
Alex Guptill cut the Notre
Dame lead in half by shooting
over " Summerhays' pad-side
shoulder.
But, just as they did Fri-
day night, the Fighting Irish
responded with two quick tal-
lies. Lee chased down a loose
puck before sailing it across the
crease to Bryan Rust, brother
of former Wolverine Matt Rust,
who finished past Rutledge.
One minute and 37 seconds
later, Peter Schneider connect-
ed on a pass from behind the
goal line to extend the lead to

three goals.
With the- middle frame
winding down, Lynch was
turned away by Summerhays,
but sophomore forward Phil
Di Giuseppe caught up to the
rebound before the goalie could
respond, and Michigan entered
the second intermission trail-
ing 4-2.
Notre Dame added two more
in a quick span to start the third
period, as well. Just 47 seconds
into the frame, Austin Wuth-
rich extended it to a 5-2 Fight-
ing Irish lead.
Junior goalie Adam Jane-
cyk came in for mop-up work.
only to surrender another goal
almost instantly.
The Wolverines got one back
on the power play as Kevin
Lynch scored his sixth of the
season despite some contact to
Summerhays. After a lengthy
video review, the goal was
called clean..
With three minutes remain-
ing in the game, junior defen-
seman Mac Bennett, playing
in his first weekend back from
injury, drove straight from cen-
ter ice to the, slot and sniped
one to make it a two-goal game.
That would beas close as Mich-
igan would come, though.
"I think physically, I feel 100
percent," Bennett said. "I think
mentally, Iam not there yet. It's
tough when you have a month
off and then you jump back in,
especially when you are playing
a team like Notre Dame. Physi-
cally I am fine, but it is going to
take a game or two to get my
head back to where it was."
The 13 combined goals the
Wolverines gave up were the
most they've allowed in a week-
end all year - the previous high
for a series was nine against
Alaska.

SOUTH BEND - The Michi-
gan hockey team appeared over-
whelmed by its series against
Notre Dame, as evidenced by the
Fighting Irish's effortless sweep
over the Wolverines 'this week-
end.
But Michigan seemed even
more taken aback by the Notre
Dame trio of juniors Anders Lee,
Jeff Costello and Bryan Rust, who
ran circles around the Wolverines
en route to 16 combined points
over the weekend.
"We don't have one line that
can outplay that line, but we've
got three lines that can play with
them," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "They've got a good
line, they've got a good team and
that's why they're way ahead of
us."
Ifthere were any Fighting Irish
players that Michigan desperately
needed to shut down in order to
have any real chance in the game,
it was that line. Both Friday and
Saturday night played out in simi-
lar ways - the Wolverines were
barely keeping themselves alive,
but quickgoals fromLee, Costello
and.Rust's line put the final nail in
Michigan's coffin.
On Friday, freshman forward
Andrew Copp's shorthanded goal
knotted the game at three in the
final four minutes of the second

period, giving Michigan some
hope that it could keep up with
Notre Dame's quick pace. Enter
Lee who, about 40 seconds later,
easily beat freshman goaltender
Jared Rutledge on aone-timer.
The Fighting Irish would go
on to score three more times in
the course of that game, but Lee's
momentum-busting goal -- off
the power play no less - was all
Notre Dame needed to pull ahead
of the Wolverines and never look
back.
Flash forward to Saturday. The
Wolverines were down, 2-1, mid-
way through the second period,
but overcoming a one-goal deficit
still seemed like afeasible mission
at that point.
Sophomore forward Alex Gup-
till had just scored on the power
play, and with the game getting
increasingly chippy, it looked like
Michigan would have a lot more
opportunities for its man advan-
tage to capitalize.
But Rust's tap in from the bot-
tom of the circle paved the way
for another Notre Dame goal less
than two minutes later, and the
Fighting Irish tendency to score
in bunches never put the Wolver-
ines close enough to effectively
play catch up.
"We needed to match their
physicality," said junior defense-
man Mac Bennett. "There are
a lot of big guys over there and
unfortunately, I don't think we

PAUL SHEMAN /Daily
point over the weekend.
'NDline
could match (that). They won a
lot more battles than we did, they
were tougher on pucks and we
couldn't match that."
Consistency on the forward
corps has been a big question
mark for the Wolverines, but in
the past few weeks, they finally
seem to have found some in the
form of their underclassmen.
Berenson admitted that some
players, like freshman Boo Nieves
and sophomore Phil Di Giuseppe,
were still too young to fully hold
their own against the Fighting
Irish's experienced trio.
Even the Wolverines' upper-
classmen couldn't do enough to
hold their own in front of the
Fighting Irish. Berenson contin-
ued to tinker with senior forward
A.J. Treais' line in order to find
a spark for his captain, but after
Treais' -3 plus-minus rating on
the weekend, the coach implied
he's going to continue to mix and
match players to ignite Treais'
game.
Despite the shortcomings,
Berenson still believes Michigan
had the potential to keep up with
Lee, Costello and Rust.
"They're a good line, but our
players are good too," Berenson
said. "They play against good
players every weekend. (Notre
Dame was) opportunistic and
they made their chances count
and had a good weekend. We
didn't."

earn big road

By GLENN MILLER Jr.
Daily Sports Writer
After a big win against Illi-
nois on Thursday, the Michigan
women's basketball team was
out to prove it was back on track.
On Sunday, the Wolverines upset
No. 13 Pur-
due, 67-56, MICHIGAN ° 67
to revive PURDUE 56
themselves
after recent struggles in confer-
ence play.
Michigan (7-4 Big Ten, 18-6
overall) outplayed Purdue (7-3,
18-5) from the opening tip to the
final whistle, holding the Boiler-
makers' offensive attack to 38.2
percent from the floor. Despite
committing 14 turnovers - two
more than Purdue commited -
Michigan compensated for its
extraneous giveaways by con-
necting on 53 percent of its shots
from behind the 3-point line.
The Wolverines raced out to an
early 17-4 lead in Mackey Arena,
but the Boilermakers battled
back, and trailed by just three.
points at the end of the first half.
After jostling with a tight margin
midway through the second half,
late free throws helped Michigan
pull away with the victory. It was
the Wolverines first win in West
Lafayette since Feb. 8,1998.
"We came out strong to start,
but we knew Purdue would come
back with their runs," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico.
"They went up in the second half,
and I was really proud of our com-
posure and how we stuck togeth-
er. We are really happy to get the
win; it had been a long time at
Purdue."
Senior guard Kate Thompson
struggled with efficiency from

beyond the arc, but managed to
lead Michigan's offense with 22
points on 6-of-16 shooting. Typi-
cally known for her defensive
skills, senior forward Nya Jor-
dan contributed 16 points and 11
rebounds - her fourth double-
double of the season.
"I know when the season first
started I was feeling a little pas-
sive, and coach wanted me to be
more aggressive," Jordan said.
"I've just been playing with
no fear and going after every
rebound I can get."
The Boilermakers finished
with three players in double dig-
its, though the Wolverines effec-
tively contained Purdue's major
"People don't
come in here
and win at
Purdue."
offensive threats. Junior guard
Courtney Moses and freshman
guard April Wilson tied for a
team-best 12 points in the game.
Junior guard KK 'Houser, who
averaged 10.3 points entering the
game, was held scoreless against a
physical Wolverine defense.
"We really worked on pack-
ing it in and encouraging their
guards to take outside shots,
with the exception of (Courtney)
Moses," Barnes Arico said. "We
were going to live and die by that.
If they made shots, we were not
going to be successful."
Thompson's 3-pointer to start

upset
off the afternoon affair not only
sparked Michigan's early offen-
sive spurt, but it also placed her
into the program's record books.
With 91 all-time 3-pointers,
Thompson is now the all-time
leader in 3-pointers made in a sea-
son. She tied Carmen Reynolds'
record of 85 3-pointers during the
Illinois game and added six more
to her total against Sunday.
"It's a tremendous honor, espe-
cially to be in the same category
as Carmen Reynolds," Thomp-
son said. "She was one of the best
3-point shooters when she was
here at Michigan. I played under
her a lot and always admired how
good she was."
Barnes Arico has stressed
the importance of controlling
the glass all season and it paid
dividends against Purdue. The
Wolverines outrebounded the
Boilermakers, 34-24, and are now
13-2 when outrebounding their
opponent this season.
Aside from earning its first
win over a ranked opponent this
season, Michigan's upset of Pur-
due helps the Wolverines remain
competitive in the Big Ten stand-
ings after dropping four out of
their last six games. In what is
becoming a logjam for a spot on
the Big Ten podium, Michigan
must carry Sunday's momentum
into its next game against Michi-
gan State at home.
"People don't come in here
and win at Purdue," Barnes Arico
said. "For us to be able to come in
here and do that,'especially after
beating Illinois, and follow it up
with this win, it says a lot about
our program and where 'we are
now. I think it is a great win; it is
a quality win; it is an NCAA win
for sure."

overtime. Michigan coach John
Beilein knew his team had a foul
to give, but Wisconsin guard Ben
Brust got a perfect inbound pass
from forward Mike Bruesewitz
and was able to turn the corner
before Michigan forward Caris
LeVert could foul him.
Brust, needing to pull the ball
up from below his waist to get a
clean release, hit a 40-foot run-
ning shot to send the game into
overtime. Like Hardaway, Brust
was smothered on the shot -
LeVert had good positioning,
Brust just hit the tough shot.
"We tried to foul," Beilein said.
"That was the instruction coming
out... (Brust) turned the corner on
Caris and we couldn't get it off in
time."
In overtime, both teams strug-
gled to score. Michigan missed
five of its six shots of the extra.
frame, including an open transi-
tion layup from McGary after
he forced a steal. After the game
Beilein said that the Wolverines
missed 14 easy points in layups,
but that it wasn't related to the,
energy at the Kohl Center.
"It has nothing to do with
being here," he said. "Some days,
you just miss layups ... there's not
a science to this. Sometimes, they.
just miss them."
The score remained tied until
Brust hit another 3-pointer with
40 seconds left in the extra frame
to win the game. The last basket
scored was just the third com-

bined made shot of overtime.
Burke, just like in a road loss to
Ohio State earlier in the year, had
a deep 3-pointer rim out with a
chance to tie the game. The fans
rushed the court, and Michigan
still hasn't won in Madison since
1999.
"I thought we fought all the
way until the end," Burke said.
"They just ended up with the
momentum today."
The first half of the game was a
little bit more routine.
As expected, Michigan started
the game, and the first half, off
slow. Wisconsin refused to break
their slow-paced offense, work-
ing the ball around the perimeter
over and over again until the per-
fect shot presented itself. For a
while, it worked, because Michi-
gan couldn't get the ball out in
transition, and the Badgers were
hitting their 3-pointers.
But Wisconsin's shots stopped
falling, and despite shooting just
over 38-percent from the floor in
the firsthalf, and just 3-for-9 from
beyond the 3-point line, the Wol-
verines kept clawing back.
Even with the slow start, a 7-0
run late in the half helped Michi-
gan go into the locker room with
a one-point lead after being down
by as much as eight earlier in the
stanza.
Neither team could pull away
in the second' half, though, as
Wisconsin's 3-pointers were
matched with Michigan's transi-
tion layups.
Michigan was led by Burke,
who was the catalyst for push-
ing the ball against a team that

wanted nothing to do with tran-
sition. He finished the game with
a game-high 19 points, and tied a
season-high with five rebounds.
Burke needed 21shots to score his
19 points, but was still vital to the
game because he pushed the ball
when the Wolverines needed it.
Again, the spark off the bench
was McGary. The big man made
multiple 18-footers, a range he
hasn't shown much this season,
and finished with 12 points on
6-for-10 shooting. With regu-
lar starter Jordan Morgan still
injured, and replacement starter
Jon Horford ineffective for most
of the contest, McGary provided
stability in the post.
Horford started the game, but
scored justtwo points in his seven
minutes of play. Stepping up in his
place was Bielfeldt, who played
a career-high 18 minutes, often
paired up with McGary.
"We said, 'Max is doing itevery
day, let's go give him a shot,' "
Beilein said. "Everybody can't be
on the scout team, and he's very
good. I really love what Max did
today."
In the midst of a brutal stretch
that has Michigan playing three
ranked teams in eleven days -
including three out of four games
on the road - a win in Madison
would have been huge. Instead, a
40-foot desperation shot has the
Wolverines needing a big win in
East Lansing on Tuesday night.

By looking solely at the
stat sheet, Michigan probably
shouldn't have won this game.
But after Hardaway hit the
shot before Brust's prayer - a
heavily contested 3-pointer to
give Michigan the three-point
lead with 2.4 seconds to go
- this was a game the Wolver-
ines needed to have.
This isn't to say Michigan
necessarily did anything
wrong - Brust hit a hell of a
shot, and sometimes you just
have to give credit to the other
team.
But depending on what hap-
pens Sunday, Michigan could
drop as far down as fourth
place in the Big Ten.
They are more than half-
way through a brutal four-
game, 11-day stretch, one that
includes three road games and
three games against ranked
teams. After Saturday in Madi-
son, the Wolverines have lost
two of their last three. That
makes the last game of the
gauntlet, at Michigan State on
Tuesday, all the more impor-
tant.
It's about as close to a must-
win game as there can be for
early February. A win means

Michigan splits its toughest
week-and-a-half of the season,
so crucial for NCAA Tourna-
ment seedingand for the state
of the team going into March.
A loss in East Lansing
means one Michigan win in its
last four games - something a
team trying to win the Big Ten
and earn a No. 1 overall seed
can't afford to do.
If Brust's shot doesn't go in,
there isn't as much pressure to
win in the hostile Breslin Cen-
ter on Tuesday. If Hardaway's
shot is the last made bucket of
the game, Michigan remains
close to the drivers' seat of the
Big Ten, regardless of what
happens against Michigan
State. If Brust doesn't get a
perfect inbounds pass, Michi-
gan can foul, giving Wisconsin
much less time to get a shot
off.
If, if, if.
College basketball isa
funny, fickle game, one where.
a team's season can potentially
swing in an instant.
It'll be up to the Wolverines
to make sure their season isn't
decided by a crazy, half-court
shot that probably shouldn't
have gone in.

Softball goes 3-1 infirst
weekend series of season

N'S GYMNASTICS
De Los Angeles
joins Mikulak on
U.S. National Team

By SIMON KAUFFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
A grand slam and a combined one-hitter
in Michigan's game against Florida Atlantic
showcased what this year's women's softball
team can be - explosive.
The 15th-ranked
Wolverines kicked off MARSHALL 1
their season by going MICHIGAN 6
3-1 at the USF Tourna-
ment in Tampa, Fla. this MICHIGAN 10
weekend, where they FAU 2
faced four different
opponents. MICHIGAN 2
Play began on Friday S. FLORIDA 3
with 'Team 35' taking
on Marshall. Sopho- MICHIGDAN 4
more pitcher Sara Dri- MICHIGAN
esenga, an All-Big Ten
selection last year, dominated on the mound
in a complete-game effort.
She was perfect through five innings and
struck out 10 while allowing only three hits
and one walk.
"(It was) definitely very big," Driesenga
said. "It's just a really good thing that our-
defense played well. ... We just played tough
and everyone stayed down on it, and kept
attacking it."
On the offensive side, the Wolverines put
up their first run in the bottom of the first
inning withoutputtingthe ball in play.
Junior centerfielder Lyndsay Doyle walked,
stole second, and came around to score on two
consecutive illegal pitches. Michigan would
tally on five more runs over the remainder of
the game, all of which came with two outs, to
defeat Marshall, 6-1.
Doyle and junior left fielder Nicole Sap-
pingfield, who hit in the first and second spots
in the lineup, combined for four of Michigan's
six runs.
"That's what (Doyle and Sappingfield)
are there for," said Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins. "We talk a lot about just doing your
part and what your role is, and the top two in
the order, that's their job. They have good at-
bats and geton base forus."
On Saturday, in their first of two games, the
Wolverines exploded against Florida Atlantic,
winning10-2 in five innings.
A trio of Michigan pitchers combined for

Sophomore pitcherSara Driesenga had 18 strikeouts in 23 innings over the four weekend games.

a one-hit performance, while the Wolverines
put up 10 runs in the fourth inning. The big-
gest contribution came from freshman short-
stop Sierra Romero, who came up with the
bases loaded and three runs already on the
board in the inning. She took the first pitch
she saw over the left-center field wall for a
grand slam, putting Michigan up 7-0. It never
looked back, scoring three more runs in the
inning.
"I think Romero comes in with a lot of
hype," Hutchins said. "She's not the only hit-
ter in our lineup that we're going to rely on,
but her part is certainly to bring home some
runs. ... She certainly is a good middle-of-the-
lineup hitter for us."
The only shortfall during the weekend for
Michigan was a 3-2 loss to No. 12 South Flori-
da - the second game of its Saturday double-
header.
The Wolverines got on the- board first
thanks to Romero's second homerun of the
weekend - a two-run shot in the top of the
first. That would prove to be Michigan's only
runs.
In the circle, Driesenga pitched well, giv-
ing up just two earned runs on six hits, but
an unearned run on a defensive error would
prove to be the difference.

In the weekend finale on Sunday, the Wol-
verines found success again, blanking Sam-
ford, 4-0, with the help of some fine defense
and another great pitching performance.
Pitching in her fourth consecutive game, Dri-
esenga went the distance'on the mound, col-
lecting five more strikeouts - giving her 18
over 23 innings during the weekend.
"I think Sara is just going to another level
here in her sophomore year," Hutchins said.
"She has really progressed forward. ... She
really gave us what we needed because we
needed her to throw a lot of innings. Her job's
just to keep us in the game until our offense
can win it and she did that all weekend long."
Against Samford, Michigan played small
ball, padding a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the
fifth using two hits, a sacrifice bunt, a field-
ing error, and a sacrifice fly to score two more,
puttingthe game at its final tally.
The weekend tournament showcased a
strong Wolverines team, one that will hope to
continue its success at the FAU Kickoff Classic
in Boca Raton, Fla. next weekend. But Michi-
gan is not content with one weekend of strong
play.
"It doesn't matter how good we are right
now," I-utchins said. "It only matters how
good we become."

Michigan rides out
Spartans at MSU

ByMAX-COHEN
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - The sec-
ond the referee slapped the mat
to signal a pin for redshirt junior
Eric Grajales, the entire Michi-
gan coaching staff jumped out of
their chairs and delivered a flurry
of fist pumps, seemingly releasing
all of the frustration that comes
with a trying Big Ten season.
With the Grajales pin, No. 19
Michigan (3-5 Big Ten, 9-6 over-
all) came from behind to take a
16-12 lead on its way to a 24-15
victory over Michigan State (0-8,
4-12) in their final dual meet of
the season.
"It's great to be able to be that
turning point in the match where
we needed the points," Grajales
said.
The bonus points Grajales
earned with the pin were cru-
cial for the Wolverines after 125-
pound redshirt junior Sean Boyle
was pinned by Michigan State
junior Brennan Lyon.'
The pin was particularly
surprising given the fifteenth-
ranked Boyle's recent success,
coming off his best victory of the
season against Ohio State's No. 12
Nikki Triggas on Friday night.
Grajales wasn't the only Wol-
verine to help Michigan work
back from its early deficit, as 133-
pound freshman Rossi Bruno
won an 11-1 major decision right
after Boyle's pin.
Bruno accumulated 5:04 of
riding time throughout his match
as he secured a takedown and a
near fall in the middle of the third
period to get the major decision.
Bruno ended his first conference
dual meet season on a high note
after suffering a great deal of
lumps along the way.
"Rossi's been up and down
throughout the whole year and
he goes out there and they get to
their feet and he put the guy on
his head and gets five points and
secures the major," said Michigan

Redshirt junior Eric Grajales had a pinthat was the turning point of the match.

assistant coach Donny Pritzlaff.
141-pound redshirt junior
Mike Hillock followed Bruno's
major decision with some excite-
ment of his own, posting a take-
down with 10 seconds remaining
on the clock to secure a 4-3 deci-
sion to continue the momentum
swing in the Wolverines' favor.
Grajales brought Michigan's
newfound momentum to a fever
pitch by the time he stepped onto
the mat, completely dominating
his opponent as he earned the pin
in 1:28 after using a quick head-
lock to score five points.
"Eric did a much better job
than he did on Friday night of
being the aggressor," Pritzlaff
said. "The match didn't last very
long and that's fine with me."
With the pin, Grajales finished
his conference dual meets with a
perfect 8-0 record, putting him in

position for a high seed in the Big
Ten tournament.
Like Grajales, 165-pound
freshman Taylor Massa finished
conference dual meets with an
undefeated record at 7-0. Against
the Spartans, he used 11 near fall
pointsto win a 15-0 technical fall.
Culminated by 174-pound red-
shirt junior Dan Yates' 12-5 deci-
sion, the Wolverines won five
of their last six matches against
Michigan State after losing three
of their first four.
Though the Big Ten dual meet
season hasn't been fist pump
worthy for Michigan, the way
the team responded to Boyle's pin
certainly was.
"Sean's your teammate, he's
like pretty much your brother,
it's like now you guys are going
to pay," Bruno said. "It's a lot of
motivation."
