Musical artist 

Matisyahu to visit 

Ann Arbor for 
performance

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

Mark 
your 
calendars 
— 

musical artist Matisyahu will 
be 
performing 
with 
fellow 

musician 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 

native Nadim Azzam at Hill 
Auditorium on April 4 as part 
of a concert series intended 
to promote unity. The concert 
is being hosted by Michigan 
Hillel and MUSIC Matters, 
who also hold the University of 
Michigan’s Annual SpringFest. 

Matisyahu, 
a 
Jewish-

American, 
and 
Azzam, 
a 

Palestinian-American, 
are 

touring together across multiple 
college campuses, attempting to 
bridge the many longstanding 
political, religious and cultural 
differences between Israel and 
Palestine.

Matisyahu got his inspiration 
for the tour from protesters 
attending 
his 
concerts 
in 

support 
of 
the 
Boycott, 

Divestment 
and 
Sanctions 

movement. 
This 
movement 

advocates for the end of public 
funding from the United States 
to Israel and aims to boycott 
institutions 
that 
financially 

support Israel, in protest of 
Israel’s policies on Palestinian 
rights.

Matisyahu said in the tour’s 

announcement 
the 
goal 
of 

this tour is to demonstrate his 
solidarity with the Palestinian 
community 
and 
encourage 

harmony 
across 
the 
entire 

Middle East.

Smith 
said 
Matisyahu 

envisions the tour creating a 
sense of community between 
different groups of students.

“He feels that there’s a lot of 

misinformation out there, and a 
lot of people who are fueled by 
anger, so he’s going around and

Candidates talk water 
crisis, Detroit school 

system failures

Democratic 
presidential 

candidates Hillary Clinton and 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.) met 

in Flint on Sunday for the seventh 
debate of the primary season, 
with a strong local focus. Over 
the two-hour debate, candidates 
answered questions from Flint 
residents 
and 
discussed 
state 

issues such as the Flint water 
crisis 
and 
the 
deterioration 

of 
Michigan’s 
economy 
and 

industry. The discussion marked 
a stark difference to Thursday’s 
Republican 
debate 
in 
Detroit, 

which devoted about 10 minutes in 
total to questions about the state.

The debate came two days 

before 
Tuesday’s 
presidential 

primary in Michigan. Clinton, who 
has frequented the state since the 
Flint water crisis began to garner 
public attention, leads Sanders with 
57 percent of the vote, according to 
the latest NBC/WSJ/Marist poll. 
Nationally, Clinton currently leads 
Sanders by 9.6 percent according 
to an average of polls from 
RealClearPolitics.

Flint water crisis:

The Flint water crisis proved a 

significant topic throughout the 
debate, with Flint Journal editor 
Bryn Mickle, one of the moderators 
of the debate, questioning both 
candidate’s approach to addressing 
the crisis and their actions in the 
city.

Both 
candidates, 
in 
their 

answers, called for the resignation 
of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder — 
a new position for Clinton and a 
repeated one for Sanders.

Zak Witus: On 
 

accountability 
in diplomacy

Democratic 

candidates should 
talk more about 
Israeli occupation

By ZAK WITUS

Daily Opinion Columnist

Throughout the Democratic 

primary and caucus race, 
candidates have spoken a lot 
about foreign policy, especially 
regarding the Middle East. 
But we have heard shockingly 
little from the Democratic 
candidates about Israel, the 
single biggest recipient of 
United States military aid 
— $3 billion per year and 
$100 billion since 1962 by 
conservative estimates.

In a press conference in 

Flint before the debate, I asked 
Bernie Sanders: If elected 
president, would you stop 
sending aid to Israel until they 
agree to abide by international 
law, namely by ending the 
illegal occupation of the West 
Bank and Gaza? He said, 

“The U.S. needs to have a level 
playing field in terms of its 
relationship to Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority … I will 
do everything I can to try to 
work in what is, as you know, 
a very, very difficult situation, 
if that is possible, but I do 
believe that the U.S. needs to 
have an even and level playing 
field dealing with both sides.”

If we take this statement 

seriously, then Sanders as 
president would send the 
same amount of aid to the PA 
as it would Israel — that could 
be $0 to each, or billions to 
each. And if Sanders means 
he would even the playing 
field between Israel and the 
PA, then he would send tens of 
billions to the PA immediately 
to offset the amount already 
sent to Israel.

For 
decades, 
and 
still 

today, the United States has 
supported Israel’s illegal and 
immoral occupation of the 
West Bank and Gaza. Sanders 
would have to do a lot to end 
Israel’s 
economic, 
political 

and military domination of the

Two new candidates are vying 

for seats on the Ann Arbor City 
Council.

Diane Giannola is a Democrat 

seeking 
councilmember 

Graydon Krapohl’s seat in Ward 
4 who is seeking re-election. 
Giannola is running under the 
slogan 
“Authentic, 
Realistic, 

Dependable.”

“I’m

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

After a tense meeting on Feb. 

25 with University of Michigan 
officials, City Council members and 
local residents are openly calling for 
the University to halt its proposed 
North Campus transit center.

The $38.5 million Transportation 

Operations 
and 
Maintenance 

Facility — which is to be built on 
North Campus adjacent to several 
residential neighborhoods — is 
meant to act as a full-service garage 
for the University’s fleet of 1,000 
buses and other vehicles. The 
project was approved by the Board 
of Regents in 2014, and the bidding 
process was initiated in February 
2016.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Ohio State Senator Keith Faber (R) speaks on behalf 
of Ohio Governor John Kasich (R) to support the 
governor’s campaign to become the Republican 
presidential nominee in the Rogel Ballroom at the 
Michigan Union on Wednesday. The governor was 
unable to attend the event due to flight complications.

MISSE D CONNECTIONS

Hillary Clinton and U.S. 

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) 
will have a sustained presence 
in Michigan this week to 
rally support and encourage 
people to vote before Tuesday’s 
primary — including a visit 
to the University of Michigan 
from Sanders.

On Monday, Sanders 

is slated to travel across 
Michigan, covering three 
cities in one day. According to 
a press release, he will discuss 
issues that are pertinent to 
Michigan voters, including 
the Flint water crisis, college 
affordability and campaign 
finance reform.

First, he is scheduled to 

visit Kalamazoo and Dearborn, 
and will finish his day with a 
final event in Ann Arbor for 
a get-out-the-vote rally and 
concert featuring Nate Ruess 
of FUN and the band JR JR. 
The Ann Arbor event will 
begin at 6:30 pm at the Crisler 
Center.

Sanders’s last visit to 

Michigan was on Feb. 15 at 
Eastern Michigan University 
in Ypsilanti. He discussed 
issues surrounding income 
inequality, campaign finance 
reform and the environment. 
The audience, which was 
mostly younger, responded 
enthusiastically to his calls 
for free college tuition, low 
interest rates on student debt 
and a $15 per hour minimum 
wage.

Clinton is scheduled to 

visit Detroit Monday, hosting a 
rally at the Charles H. Wright 
Museum of African American 
History in the evening. She 
has had a strong presence in 
Michigan over the last few 
months in light of the Flint 
water crisis, visiting the city 
on Feb. 7 to encourage federal 
funding. Her daughter, Chelsea 
Clinton, has also visited Flint.

Mayor Karen Weaver 

expressed her support for 
Clinton in January, the Detroit 

Free Press reported, after she 
was the first candidate to reach 
out to offer help to the city.

Sanders has also offered 

support to Flint, and in recent 
months has called for the 
resignation of Michigan Gov. 
Rick Snyder (R), a position 
Clinton also expressed for 
the first time during Sunday’s 
Democratic debate in the city.

Clinton is projected to 

win Tuesday’s Democratic 
Michigan primaries. According 
to a Detroit Free Press poll, 
she is currently 25 points 
ahead of Sanders with 56 
percent of the vote. The two 
Democratic candidates are 
split roughly even among white 
voters, with Clinton leading 
among African-American 
voters at a total of 66 percent 
support. Sanders is 27 points 
ahead of Clinton among the 
independent voters, Politico 
reports.

Focus of Detroit GOP debate remained on national issues

State concerns limited 
to 10 minutes out of 
two hours of questions

By SHOHAM GEVA

Editor in Chief

DETROIT — Michigan isn’t 

quite a stranger to attention in 
the presidential race, despite a 
late primary — over the past few 
elections, several debates have 
been held here, and candidate visits 
tend be fairly frequent. But the 
emphasis on the state this cycle, 
with Michigan cities playing host 

to both a Republican and Democrat 
debate before Tuesday’s primary — 
and a overall heightened presence 
in the news in the aftermath of the 
Flint water crisis — stands out as 
unique. 

However, for the Republicans 

in Detroit Thursday, the first of the 
two local debates, the focus seemed 
to remain largely on national issues 
and not the state.

State issues largely emerged 

in the latter half of the two-hour 
debate for about only 10 minutes 
in total, with three individual 
questions on the Flint water crisis, 
Detroit Public School’s debt and 
manufacturing jobs posed to the 

majority of candidates.

Speaking to Flint, U.S. Sen. 

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called the 
water crisis a failure of government, 
also charging that Democrats had 
unfairly politicized the issue.

“All of us are outraged by what 

happened,” he said. “And we should 
work together to solve it. And there 
is a proper role for the government 
to play at the federal level, in helping 
local communities to respond to a 
catastrophe of this kind.”

Ohio Governor John Kasich (R), 

asked about debt in DPS, said his 
plan to fix schools is to disseminate 
resources currently in federal 
programs to the states, as well as 

encourage vocational educational 
and school choice with voucher 
and charter programs.

Both those issues received a 

different, more sustained kind of 
attention earlier in the evening, 
when roughly 100 protestors 
gathered outside the Fox Theatre 
to call for action in Flint and 
Detroit, as well as for a raise in the 
state’s minimum wage.

Keith Harris, a Southfield 

resident, carried a sign equating 
GOP frontrunner Donald Trump 
and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s 
(R) policies as racist during the 
protest. 

“I hope they take away the fact 

that we really, really want to be 
treated fair,” he said of the GOP 
candidates. “We want schools, we 
want fresh water in Flint, we want 
the police to stop murdering us.”

Moderators also asked U.S. Sen. 

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) about creating 
manufacturing jobs in the city, an 
issue cited by several protesters. 
In response, the senator pivoted to 
a criticism of Detroit’s leadership, 
saying that left-wing Democrats 
“pursued destructive tax policies, 
weak crime policies, and have 
driven the citizens out,” of the city.

His tax plan and push to repeal 

regulations like Obamacare, he 
added, would bring jobs back.

In 
an 
interview 
before 

the 
debate, 
Donald 
Grimes, 

economist at the University of 
Michigan’s Institute for Research 
for 
Labor, 
Employment 
and 

the Economy, said he hoped 
Michigan’s later primary and the 
attention the state is receiving 
this cycle, would translate into a 
bigger focus on economic issues. 

That focus, especially when it 
comes to Michigan’s unique ties 
to the auto industry, could be the 
state’s contribution to the national 
conversation, he added.

“It turns out that’s fortuitous 

timing for Michigan, to be all by 
myself (in the primary calendar),” 
Grimes said. “Hopefully this will 
help bring the questioning back to 
the domestic economy, the auto 
industry, and the whole issue of too 
big to fail.”

Standing outside the debate 

an hour before it started, Kelsey 
Bright, a Berklee resident and 
Kasich 
supporter, 
said 
she 

hoped candidates took away an 
understanding of top issues in 
Michigan, such as jobs, and how 
they played into the country as a 
whole.

“A lot of the other issues that 

you’re even hearing about tonight, 
if we had people back to work, they 
probably wouldn’t even be issues,” 
she said.

Beyond the state issues, the 

national topics that comprised 
most of Thursday’s debate ranged 
from the state of the campaign to 
new nuances of policy that has been 
controversial throughout it, such as 
immigration reform.

As the nomination convention 

gets closer, electability in particular 
proved a contentious topic. Two 
days before the debate, Trump won 
seven states in this year’s Super 
Tuesday, a day in when 11 states go 
to the polls, continuing to cement 
his lead in the race. He is currently 
projected to take Michigan by 
over 15 percent next week. Of the 
remaining states, Cruz won three, 
and Rubio won one.

Kasich and Ben Carson, who 

was not at Thursday’s debate after 
signaling he may drop out of the 
race Thursday morning, both won 
none. 

Those 
results 
prompted 
a 

discussion throughout the night 
about what paths to the nomination 
Rubio, Cruz and Kasich saw, 
drawing a range of ongoing 
criticisms about Trump.

Early on in the debate, Rubio 

charged 
that 
Trump 
would 

ultimately be unsuccessful because 
he didn’t represent the GOP 
electorate. 

“Two-thirds of the people who 

have cast a vote in a Republican 

primary or caucus have voted 
against you,” Rubio said. “And the 
reason why is because we are not 
going to turn over the conservative 
movement, or the party of Lincoln 
or 
Reagan, 
for 
example, 
to 

someone whose positions are not 
conservative.”

Cruz took a similar angle later 

on, pointing to Trump as part of the 
D.C. establishment, which Trump 
disputed.

“I understand the folks who 

are supporting Donald right now,” 
Cruz said. “You’re angry. You’re 
angry at Washington, and he 
uses angry rhetoric. But for 40 
years, Donald has been part of the 
corruption in Washington that 
you’re angry about.

Trump cited multiple polls 

showing him ahead in the race in 
response.

In remarks to press after the 

debate about their path forward, 
the Cruz, Kasich and Rubio 
campaigns expressed varied plans 
for Michigan. Kasich said he wasn’t 
planning on winning the state, and 
was instead focusing on winning 
his home state of Ohio. Proponents 
for Rubio and Cruz were more 
optimistic about strong finishes in 
the state — though not necessarily 
victories.

Immigration was another large 

topic, with both candidates and 
moderators pushing Trump about 
releasing recordings of a off the 
record interview with the New 
York Times that reports have 
suggested include him saying he is 
flexible about his immigration plan 
to deport millions.

Off the record refers to an 

agreement between a journalist 
and a interview subject to not quote 
or use information acquired during 
a conversation. The New York 
Times has said they will release the 
recordings if Trump agrees to it.

However, Trump said Thursday 

night he wouldn’t agree to release 
the recordings because he had “too 
much respect” for off the record 
agreements. Though stressing that 
flexibility in policy was important, 
he noted that immigration was not 
an issue he planned to shift much 
on.

“(I’m) not very flexible,” he said. 

“I give the example — I’m going to 
build a wall. I’m the one that wants 
the wall. I’m the one that can build 

the wall. It’s going to get built...but 
— and I used an example. And this 
isn’t necessarily what was said, but 
whatever was said, the wall’s 50 
feet high. Is it going to be 45 feet or 
40 feet? That could very well be.”

Higher education also received 

brief attention in a Rubio attack 
on Trump over Trump University, 
a for-profit education institution 
founded by the candidate. It is 
currently the subject of several 
lawsuits over whether Trump 
defrauded individuals who bought 
the courses.

After the debate, Aaron Kall, 

director of the University of 
Michigan’s debate program and 
an expert on election politics, 
said he thought the balance 
between national and state issues 
in 
particular 
was 
noticeably 

surprising and disappointing.

“At least the moderators (gave 

up on the state),” Kall said. “I mean, 
that’s kind of the logical extension. 
The frontrunner wasn’t even asked 
a direct question. They probably 
saw the Detroit Free Press poll and 
said, (Trump’s) got about a ten point 
lead, and so maybe it’s over….but 
yeah, very disappointing. We can 
only hope, that the Democratic side 
on Sunday, things will be different.”

Looking 
forward, 
whether 

the attention paid to Michigan’s 
big issues, like Flint and DPS and 
beyond, will be a contrast in the 
state’s second turn in the national 
spotlight before Tuesday’s primary 
— when the Democrats face off in 
Flint Sunday — remains to be seen, 
as well as the potential presence of 
those issues further on in the race. 

Unlike 
the 
GOP, 
both 

Democratic 
candidates 
have 

brought Michigan up in prior 
debates, largely to criticize Snyder’s 
response to Flint’s water crisis. 

However, 
in 
an 
interview 

Thursday at the GOP debate, 
Brandon 
Dillon, 
Michigan 

Democratic Party chair, noted 
that he expected some noticeable 
differences in content and tenor 
Sunday night regardless of topic.

“I think it’s very simple — the 

contrast you’ve seen in every 
debate,” Dillon said. “You have one 
side that’s all insults and attacks all 
the time, and on the Democratic 
side you actually have a rigorous 
debate about policy and ideas about 
how to move the country forward.”

Smith said.

be 

attending a campus luncheon 
on the day of the concert to

diverse groups, as well as other 
topics related to the Israeli-

conflict, 
with 

University students.

Azzam said rather than trying 

to solve all the problems of the 
Middle East, the concert series 
is about finding a fundamental 
connection between people of 
different backgrounds.

“In 
regards 
to 
the 

sociopolitical 
context 
of 

Palestine and Israel, things 
are much more complex and 
intense than a campus concert 
series can address,” he said. 
“But before we can, as a 
society, reconcile differences 
in belief and opinion between 
Palestinians and Israelis, we 
have to first find common 
ground as human beings. And 
music is one powerful way to do 
that.”

in air pollution, traffic congestion 
and noise, there is consensus 
among some local residents that 
the University has advanced the 
project without public consent.

Because the University is a 

state entity, it is able to circumvent 
zoning 
requirements 
for 
new 

construction, and can therefore 
unilaterally 
undertake 
new 

projects without city approval.

City 
Councilmember 
Kirk 

Westphal (D–Ward 2) wrote a 
letter to University President Mark 
Schlissel last month to urge the 
project be paused until consent 
from the community can be 
reached. Kirk said Schlissel replied 
to his letter Feb. 26, assuring him 
that his concerns wouldn’t be 
ignored. 

“We 
will 
consider 
your 

suggestion that the University be 
more thoughtful and responsive 
to neighborhood concerns when 
planning a facility that abuts 
a 
residential 
neighborhood,” 

Schlissel wrote to Westphal.

Westphal said in an interview 

Feb. 28 the speed with which 
Schlissel replied to his letter 
has made him confident that an 
agreement with the University can 
be reached.

“President 
Schlissel 
reached 

out very quickly to those of us 
who 
expressed 
concern, 
and 

we’re optimistic that this signifies 
a different kind of relationship 
than what U of M has had with 
city residents,” Westphal said. 
“I’ve been told by folks with a 
much longer history than I have 
in Ann Arbor that U of M has 
not responded this quickly to 
neighborhood requests.”

Linh Song, School of Social 

Work lecturer and president of the 
Glacier Highlands Neighborhood 
Association, a leading opponent of 
the facility, said she is frustrated 
with the lack of transparency on 
the part of the University.

“It’s 
not 
that 
we’re 
anti-

development … we’re just trying 
to understand why they chose this 
site for this purpose, when there 
are so many lots available that are 
not residential,” Song said. “We’re 
asking for environmental analysis, 
traffic reports, air quality … this is 
data that we hoped they would have 

on hand while getting so far along 
the process, and it’s not there.”

Song added she believes the 

University is speaking to the 
community in bad faith, pointing 
out that they had advanced the 
project despite promising to hear 
community input.

“Considering they’ve put the 

project out to bid, it seems like a 
disingenuous promise,” Song said.

Stakeholders 
from 
across 

northeast Ann Arbor convened 
on Sunday evening to organize 
a 
petition 
and 
letter-writing 

campaign to the regents to increase 
community input on the project. 
Song also said residents are 
planning to protest the next regents 
meeting with their children.

Jim Kosteva, the University’s 

director of Community Relations, 
wrote in an e-mail on Feb. 29 that 
resident concerns would not be 
ignored as this project proceeds.

“We are going to assess the 

comments made at last Thursday’s 
meeting, 
determine 
what 

additional studies or evaluations 
may be necessary, and develop a 
more comprehensive response to 
resident concerns,” Kosteva wrote.

question first, pushing back on 
his suggestion that candidates 
were visiting Flint merely to 
campaign there and citing previous 
experiences 
working 
to 
aid 

communities suffering from crises.

The candidate has highlighted 

the water crisis multiple times in 
the past month, including in her 
closing statements at the Jan. 17 
Democratic debate. She has since 
campaigned on the issue, visiting 
Flint and meeting with community 
leaders. 
Herdaughter, 
Chelsea 

Clinton, has also campaigned in the 
state separately.

“This problem is one that is 

particularly outrageous and painful 
at the same time,” Clinton said 
Sunday. “So, when I heard about it 
I immediately sent people here to 
find out what was going on. It was 
almost unbelievable. We have this 
problem in other places, but we 
don’t say that it was actually caused 
by decisions made by public officials 
in positions of authority, as this one 
was.”

Clinton 
added 
that 
her 

commitment to Flint doesn’t end 
after the Michigan primaries, 
noting discussions she’s had with 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and 
state residents.

“I’m going to do everything I 

can. And, I will be with Flint all the 
way through this crisis in whatever 
capacity I am,” Clinton said. “And, 
if I’m president, it will always be a 
priority for action from me.”

To Sanders, Mickle asked why he 

had not paid as much attention as 
Clinton had to the crisis.

The debate marks Sanders’ 

second public visit to Flint following 
a town hall meeting two weeks 
ago, though he has also raised 
awareness on the issue throughout 
his campaign, calling for Snyder’s 
resignation on Jan. 17.

In response to the question, 

Sanders brought up his town hall.

“(The 
meeting) 
was 
as 

nonpolitical as I could make it 
for hundreds of people to tell me 
and the world through the media 
exactly what was happening here 
in Flint,” Sanders said. “I think 
the fear and the legitimate fear of 
the people of Flint is that a certain 
point the TV cameras and CNN will 
disappear. And people are going to 
be left struggling in order to live in a 
safe and healthy community.”

The crisis was also a focus before 

the 
debate: 
protesters 
outside 

chanted “Raise the wage, clean our 
water” with the goal of drawing 
attention to raising minimum wage 
laws and the Flint water crisis.

Auto bailout:

Trade 
agreements 
and 

protecting 
domestic 
industries 

— specifically the auto industry — 

were a recurring focus throughout 
the debate.

The topic was a contentious one 

for the candidates, as they both 
tried talking over each other and 
attacked their opponent’s records 
on the issue.

Clinton repeatedly pointed to 

Sanders’ lack of support in the 
Senate for a bill that approved funds 
for the auto industry bailout — the 
Troubled Asset Relief Program 
— along with a number of other 
measures, including bailing out 
several of the large banks. The 
bailout ultimately prevented two of 
the three major United States auto 
producers, Chrysler and General 
Motors, from declaring bankruptcy, 
which was projected to result in a 
loss of 1 million jobs in Michigan 
on top of the state’s 25 percent 
unemployment rate at the time.

Sanders responded to Clinton’s 

comments by calling the auto 
bailout the “Wall Street bailout” 
and saying his opposition to the 
package was based on the need for 
billionaires to pay for their own 
bailout instead of using taxpayer 
dollars.

“When billionaires on Wall 

Street destroyed this economy, they 
went to Congress and they said, 
‘please, we’ll be good boys, bail us 
out,’ ” Sanders said. “You know what 
I said? I said, ‘let the billionaires 
themselves bail out Wall Street.’ It 
shouldn’t be the middle class of this 
country.”

Detroit Public Schools:

Staying 
Michigan-centric, 
a 

question on improving the nation’s 
education system focused on the 
crumbling school system in Detroit, 
which is currently $3.5 billion in 
debt.

Detroit 
mother 
Shoniqua 

Kemp, who is part of a group of 
parents suing the school system 
for improved conditions, asked the 
question to the candidate.

“My daughter cannot wait eight 

more years for success to take 
place at your hands, at the leader’s 
hands,” she said.

In response, Sanders said the 

nation should be embarrassed by 
the situation, focusing on the issue 
of inequality. He noted that the 
United States has the highest rate of 
childhood poverty, saying the issue 
goes beyond underfunded school 
systems.

“A great nation is judged not 

by how many millionaires and 
billionaires it has, but by how it 
treats the most vulnerable amongst 
us, and that is the children, and that 
is the elderly,” Sanders said. “And, 
do you know what? We should be 
ashamed of how we treat our kids 
and our senior citizens.”

Clinton, in contrast, answered 

the question with a definitive 
three point plan to address the 
inequality happening in Detroit 
schools. Throughout the campaign, 

Clinton has received strong support 
from 
primary 
and 
secondary 

educators — she has been endorsed 
by both major teachers’ unions: the 
American Federation of Teachers 
and 
the 
National 
Education 

Association.

As part of her plan, she said 

she would reinstate a program 
put in place during her husband 
Bill Clinton’s presidency in the 
1990s, which allowed the federal 
government to provide funding 
to improve impoverished schools. 
As well, she said she would 
remove emergency management 
of Detroit’s schools and set up a 
group within the Department of 
Education which would focus on 
improving schools like those in 
Detroit.

“I want to set up inside the 

Department of Education, for want 
of a better term, kind of an education 
SWAT team, if you will,” Clinton 
said. “Where we’ve got qualified 
people, teachers, principals, maybe 
folks who are retired, maybe folks 
who are active, but all of whom are 
willing to come and help. When 
Detroit gets back their schools, they 
should have all the help they can 
get to be able to get teachers in the 
classroom, to be able to find spaces 
while schools are being repaired.”

Sanders said the issues the K-12 

schools in Detroit and across the 
country extend to higher education 
as well. He said when thinking 
about education, the United States 
should start by ensuring higher 
education is accessible for all 
students.

“So, starting with the top — now, 

I know some people think it’s a 
radical idea, I don’t,” Sanders said. 
“I believe that every public college 
and university in this country 
should be tuition free. So that your 
child, regardless of the income 
of your family, knows that if she 
studies hard, she is going to be able 
to go to college.”

In 
an 
impromptu 
press 

conference 
before 
the 
debate, 

Sanders expanded on his views 
on revamping higher education, 
calling for a more comprehensive 
approach to public education.

“In 2016, when we look at public 

education, it can no longer be first 
grade through 12th grade — free 
public education — that was a great 
idea for many, many decades, but 
right now in many ways a college 
degree is the equivalent of a high 
school degree was 50 years ago,” he 
said.

Because of student debt, he 

added, some people cannot get 
married, buy a car, a house or have 
children.

“We should not be punishing 

people for the ‘crime’ of getting a 
higher education,” Sanders said. 
“We have legislation in the works 
that would substantially reduce 
student debt in this country.”

Council members and residents. 
She added that as of now, there is 
too much debate and not enough 
discussion about what the actual 
issues are.

“I’m running to be more of a 

voice, and more of an effective 
voice for our ward,” Giannola said. 
“Whether they agree with me or 
not doesn’t matter, as long as they 
are discussing the same facts.”

Her focus is also on the 

importance 
of 
transparency 

according to her website.

“My philosophy is to not just 

inform people about issues, but to 
help them understand what things 
mean,” the website reads.

Giannola has been a resident of 

Ann Arbor for about 20 years and 
is a University alum.

However, she said she does 

not foresee her ties with the 
University impacting her actions 
or decisions should she earn a seat 
on City Council.

“The University and the city are 

different entities,” she said. “The 
answer is strictly no. There will be 
no conflicts.”

With a background in politics 

including involvement throughout 

her entire adult life, Giannola said 
she is excited by the idea of taking 
a seat on City Council. She served 
on the City Planning Commission 
from 2009 until 2014. Additionally, 
she served on the city’s Historic 
District Commission from 2007 
until 2010. She also runs a political 
blog.

“Politics is a hobby that I’ve 

always 
done,” 
Giannola 
said. 

“I’ve always wanted to run, I’ve 
just never stepped up to be the 
candidate until now.”

4A — Monday, March 7, 2016

Last year was a tumultuous one. Our 

nation’s race problems, which have often 
been underplayed and ignored, refused to 
remain unseen and silent any longer. The 
race “issue” forced itself onto the front page 
of major newspapers, onto TV screens and 
into conversations among friends, families 
and strangers.

The race “issue” is not a new problem, but 

it came as a surprise to many who believed 
we live in a post-racism America. The 
frustration seen in Ferguson, Baltimore, 
Cleveland and elsewhere was something I 
could relate to when I was a student at the 
University of Michigan. Being a Black male 
at this University was not an easy task. I 
felt isolated. People expected me to be the 
spokesman for my race. Often, classmates 
assumed I was only there because of a 
sports scholarship or affirmative action. 
Despite these challenges, I was able to seek 
comfort and find community and under-
standing in Iota Phi Theta, S.I.B.S and a 
supportive group of friends.

For these reasons among others, I decid-

ed in 2010 to join Teach For America. I knew 
how it felt to be the only one to not have a role 
model in the classroom (and in other social 
and professional settings) who looked like 
you. I was determined to join other dedicat-
ed educators of color in changing this real-
ity for the next generation of students. As a 
corps member, I taught elementary school 
for two years in Houston public schools. 
During this time I learned I had not only an 
aptitude for teaching, but also the patience 
for working hard and learning quickly. As 
a result, my students made immense gains; 
however, I longed to make an impact in my 
hometown of Detroit. So after my two years 
in Texas, I returned to Detroit to teach and 
later act as a school administrator at a char-
ter school in Northwest Detroit.

Being a teacher and a school leader are 

the hardest things I’ve ever done in my 28 
years of life. But with all challenges, the 
reward is well worth the struggles. At the 
end of the school year, I asked my Detroit 
sixth-graders what they wanted to be when 
they grew up. And I was overwhelmed when 
so many of them responded with “a teacher 
… just like you.”

Many of my students at the charter school 

were Black males. If one of them was having 
behavioral issues, they would often request 
to see me and I would say, “Why did you 
come see me? Why can you behave with me 
but not with your other teachers?” and in so 
many words they discussed how I was “dif-
ferent” and how I “just understood them.” 
To them, having a Black male educator 
meant having a teacher who knew what it 
was like to be them — not only did I look like 
my students, but I also lived through many 
of the same challenges they faced.

I am no longer in the classroom, but the 

experiences and feelings I gained during my 
time as a teacher have never left me; I am 
still advocating for educational equity for 
our underserved Black and brown children. 
Through my new role as an educational con-
sultant and as a mentor to young Black boys, I 
continue my work in transforming the educa-
tion system and the lives of those who are often 
ignored and misunderstood by our society.

Teaching is not for everyone, but anyone 

can be an advocate for students. You can 
volunteer at your local school, become a 
mentor, get involved in youth activities dur-
ing the weekends or provide employment 
opportunities. And if you are interested in 
teaching, there isn’t a better way to make 
a difference in the lives of children than 
through Teach for America.

Children cannot be what they cannot 

see. It’s our duty as adults to ensure they 
are exposed to and represented in diverse 
images, texts and the media. Just imagine 
the young minds who are dreaming of great-
er futures thanks to images of President 
Obama, Misty Copeland, John Boyega and 
educators who look like them. It is impera-
tive that we focus on the latter and increase 
diversity in the teaching profession. As the 
nation’s student population grows more 
brown, Black and diverse in other ways each 
day, we need adults in schools — at every 
level — to reflect these changes and be the 
positive role models our students need.

here is a picture on my 
phone that I look at every 
now and then. It’s a photo 

of a photo of my 
little brother a 
few hours after 
he 
was 
born; 

this 
frankly 

terribly 
low-

res 
photo 
of 

this 
itsy-bitsy 

baby 
bundled 

in striped pink 
and blue sheets 
making 
some 

odd face I can-
not really com-
prehend. I think of his tiny, 
darling fingers trying to touch 
my young face, and my heart 
cannot help but swell. Moments 
come, moments go, and of the 
few really memorable days of my 
life, that evening when I became 
a big brother stays afloat. 

He was probably my first real 

companion, and I was definitely 
his. We spent a lot of time in each 
other’s company, enough to feel 
like the other was a part of who we 
were individually. It’s a very fasci-
nating dynamic — seeing someone 
live for the first time, while trying 
to simultaneously trying to really 
make sense of things yourself. But 
there is an effect at play here, and 
that is one of idealization. Due to 
the age difference and cultural 
norms, there exists this subtle sort 
of information and experience gap. 
It’s this feeling that we cannot tell 
the other everything, we cannot 
share every thought or experience 
fearing it would not be understood 
or it would be inappropriate. All of 
which leads to creating an image 
of the other in your head where, 

in this case, your faults are mini-
mized and strengths doubled, 
an asymmetrical relationship of 
truth and fantasy.

You have expectations and 

ideas placed upon you, you are 
some idealized version of your-
self, and there is a particular 
pressure that accompanies that. 
I want to note that this is dif-
ferent from having expectations 
set from school and friends and 
parents, and it is different in a 
way I did not understand when 
I was growing up. I carried 
around this idea that my behav-
ior, my actions, my preferences 
will be studied and scrutinized, 
and this honestly removed a cer-
tain degree of freedom from my 
life. I had influence I did not 
earn, but rather stumbled upon. 
I will admit there were a few 
times when I struggled with this 
power. I was trapped by these 
ideals, where I felt I couldn’t do 
anything I wanted because there 
was a tiny person listening and 
watching intently.

Now, a littler older, I think 

I understand my role better. I 
understand that a younger sib-
ling looks up to you because 
they can’t help but look up to 
you. An innocent yet pure regard 
that comes from a love much too 
deep to be taken for granted. A 
respect for that takes perhaps 
much too long for an older one to 
truly understand. Alas, he can-
not help being a little brother, 
and I cannot help be an older 
one. All I can do is try to honor 
my role.

One learns many lessons of 

responsibility and understanding 
by taking care of someone who 

doesn’t know any better. There is 
perhaps one thing of significant 
value that I believe I have gained. 
By 
having 
responsibility 
over 

someone, taking care of them, 
protecting them, you start to lose 
this idea of your own importance 
in the world. You start to do what’s 
best for them, doing all the day-to-
day sacrifices because you know 
it makes him happy. You let him 
have the last slice of pizza, feel-
ing happier that he gets to have 
it. You learn to let go of the petty. 
By putting someone else ahead, 
you begin to realize that life isn’t 
limited to you. You slowly begin to 
inhabit a world where you are no 
longer the center — you gain a gen-
erosity of spirit.

I realize now that this is how 

things simply are, that I am an 
older brother and I always will 
be. Yes, my life is never going to 
ever be as free as it might have 
been before, but at least I will 
never really be alone. I will for-
evermore have a little compan-
ion who I will always love and 
who will always love me. That’s 
a cost I’d pay with a smile.

I hope, someday, this gap 

diminishes while the respect we 
have for one another remains — 
that not too long from now we’ll 
be closer than we ever could 
be as children. Regardless, I 
sincerely hope that little baby 
becomes better than me in all 
every way, shape and form — I 
hope he becomes happier, stron-
ger, smarter, braver and taller. 
Well, perhaps not taller. After 
all, I am the bigger one.

rowing up, one of the first 
things I remember learn-
ing was to buckle my seat 

belt 
when 
I 

entered a car. 
It was so heav-
ily emphasized 
that 
I 
totally 

freaked 
out 

in the second 
grade when a 
friend cheekily 
admitted 
that 

sometimes, 
he 

purposefully 
forgot to buckle 
up, just for the 
thrill of it.

As I was riding in the back of an 

Uber earlier this week, I realized 
that the mentality behind wear-
ing a seat belt is kind of like the 
mentality behind voting. Wear-
ing a seatbelt, much like voting, is 
something the vast majority of us 
know we should always do. Some-
times, however, we rationalize 
not doing the “right thing” in the 
name of convenience or perceived 
necessity.

For example, I consistently put 

on a seat belt whenever I drive 
anywhere, whether I’m the one 
actually behind the wheel or not. 
However, I recently realized that 
when I’m in the backseat of a cab, 
more times than not, I don’t wear 
a seatbelt. And I’m not alone — 
according to a survey from the 
New York City Taxi and Limou-
sine Commission, “only 38% of 
passengers reported they were 
using the taxi’s seat belts” during 
their ride. 

For me, this dangerous phenom-

enon reflects a somewhat contra-
dictory perception of both control 
and convenience. I subconsciously 
trust the cab driver to be safe (he 
is a “professional” driver, techni-
cally), and I’m only in the car for a 
short period of time, so I rational-
ize not wearing a seat belt.

This logic is totally backward, 

by the way — just because a man 
is in a car more hours than oth-
ers doesn’t make him more adept 
at avoiding accidents. But to save 
the “hassle” of wearing a seat belt, 
I knowingly surrender an element 
I control based on the assumption 
that the cabbie will drive safely 
and not be an idiot on the road. In 
the back of the cab, I’m not behind 
the wheel, and I’m only in the car 

for a few minutes. Chances are I’ll 
get to my destination safely, so I 
stay unbuckled. Deliberately.

Not wearing a seat belt in the 

back of a cab is like not voting in 
an election, but still having a vest-
ed interest in who wins. You’re in a 
situation that could either go your 
way (you arrive at your destina-
tion safely) or not (you crash and 
get hurt). By not voting, you volun-
tarily forfeit an element of democ-
racy in which you do have control. 
As a result, any future complaint 
you might have about our govern-
ment, our leaders or their policies, 
becomes invalid.

All too often, I hear from my 

peers that they hate all the can-
didates and that they don’t even 
know if they’ll vote. This is not 
OK. The freedom to vote free of 
intimidation and violence is a 
right many Americans have died 
to protect. The least you can do as 
a citizen is to perform your civic 
duty and vote.

But in this election, failing to 

vote has been imbued with an 
unprecedented sense of urgency. 
In 2016, when you don’t vote, you 
play with fire. This election sea-
son, not voting means knowingly 
increasing the chance of having 
a deplorable, race-baiting dema-
gogue — the utterly unqualified, 
misogynistic and bigoted Donald 
Trump — represent our nation.

Trump uniquely alienates both 

Democrats and Republicans in his 
hateful, 
condescending 
speech 

and his inconsistent, inarticulate 
policy proposals that he calls a 
platform. Trump exploits fears of 
some of America’s most intoler-
ant voters, and his racist policies 

have earned him the enthusiastic 
endorsement of renowned white 
supremacist David Duke, whose 
approval Trump at first failed to 
disavow.

Trump blatantly lies all the 

time. He earned the 2015 “Lie 
of the Year” award from Politi-
Fact, which ruled 78 percent of 
his statements as “mostly false,” 
“false” or “pants on fire.” And for 
those who say all politicians lie, it 
should be noted that some do so 
more than others; PolitiFact ruled 
just 28 percent of Hillary Clinton’s 
and 31 percent of John Kasich’s 
statements negatively.

Fellow millennials, not voting 

means knowingly forfeiting any 
attempt to stop this man, Donald 
Trump, who lies and manipulates 
while white supremacists cheer 
loudly on the sidelines. This is 
unacceptable.

We need to put up a fight, par-

ticularly after this past Super 
Tuesday’s results. We can’t throw 
our hands up in the air and forfeit 
our chance to sway the outcome of 
the presidential election, because 
if we do, there’s a very real chance 
that Trump could be elected. So 
much of deciding the ultimate 
winner depends on who actually 
votes, and if we, the young people, 
don’t show up, then the markedly 
intolerant white, middle-aged men 
who do cast ballots for Trump will 
make that decision for us.

Dying in the back of a cab 

because you failed to wear a seat-
belt is tragic. However, it’s unde-
niable that you could’ve done 
something to reduce the likelihood 
of the outcome. If Donald Trump 
is elected president of the United 
States, we — the young, more com-
passionate voters who failed to vote 
— are partially at fault.

Trump has tapped into a danger-

ous and ugly vein of hate and intol-
erance in his support base, but I 
want to believe it can be diluted if 
more rational voters pay attention 
and participate. So please, don’t 
let your lackluster enthusiasm for 
the candidates serve as an excuse 
to skip voting today, even if there’s 
a line out the door at the Michigan 
Union. Pay attention. Check back in. 
Wear a seatbelt, even in the back of 
a cab. Vote.

who failed to vote — 
are partially at fault.”

occupied 
ter-

ritories. 
But 

even refusing 
to 
privilege 

one side over the 

other — which would necessarily imply end-
ing U.S. support for the illegal and immoral 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza — 
would be a huge step.

Hillary Clinton has consistently sup-

ported regime change in the Middle East 
that ended in disaster. As a senator, she sup-
ported regime change in Iraq. On the Sen-
ate floor, before the vote that authorized the 
use of force in Iraq, Clinton echoed the same 
argument as the Bush II administration: 
“In the four years since the inspectors left, 
intelligence reports show that Saddam Hus-
sein has worked to rebuild his chemical and 
biological weapons stock, his missile deliv-
ery capability and his nuclear program. He 
has also given aid, comfort and sanctuary to 
terrorists, including al-Qaeda members … ”

We know now that these claims were all 

empirically false; Hussein wasn’t working 
to develop weapons of mass destruction, 
and there was no al-Qaeda-Iraq connection. 
We also know that the U.S. invasion of Iraq 
had terrible results, including, among other 
things, the deaths of some 500,000 Iraqis, 
the rise of the Islamic State and a cost of 
more than $2 trillion for the U.S. taxpayers.

Clinton also supported the NATO-led 

regime change in Libya. According to the 
recent New York Times expose, President 
Obama was apparently highly ambivalent 
about the decision to go to war in Libya: 
Obama’s then-Defense Secretary Robert 
M. Gates called it a “51-49” decision, and, 
according to Gates, “Hillary’s support for 
the broader mission in Libya put the presi-
dent on the 51 side of the line for a more 

aggressive approach.”

The war in Libya not only violated inter-

national law, but also U.S. law. Obama sent 
U.S. troops to Libya without congressional 
approval and in violation of the War Pow-
ers Resolution, which specifies that the 
president must withdraw troops from “hos-
tilities” if he doesn’t secure congressional 
consent within 60 days from the start of the 
conflict, which he had failed to do.

The results of the bombing campaign so 

far? Libya broke out into civil war. Unse-
cured arms stashes in Libya spread west 
across the African Sahel and east to Syria. 
And, according to Columbia University 
Prof. Jeffrey Sachs, “The Libyan disaster 
has spawned war in Mali, fed weapons to 
Boko Haram in Nigeria, and fueled ISIS in 
Syria and Iraq.”

There’s no doubt that Saddam Hussein, 

Muammar Gaddafi and Bashar al-Assad were 
and are brutal dictators. But U.S. military 
intervention clearly had horrible results in 
these cases and others (Central America and 
Southeast Asia come to mind). U.S. support for 
Israel has also had horrible results, especially 
if you care about the lives of Palestinians.

Even if the United States did have a 

responsibility to help other countries mili-
tarily, we have demonstrated such incompe-
tence that we must focus on another, more 
basic responsibility to do no harm. Fur-
thermore, our failure to help the vulnerable 
people who our leaders claim that they want 
to help points to the real goal of our foreign 
policy, which has had very little to do with 
the rights of other peoples, and everything 
to do with U.S. corporate interests and 
world domination.

‘Fuller House’ sucks

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

I’m having a hard time figuring 

out what to make of “Fuller House.” 
When I was younger, I would watch 
repeats 
of 
“Full 

House” every day 
on ABC Family and 
it was one of my 
favorite TV shows. 
But, as I grew 
older, 
I 
stopped 

watching the same 
adventures of the 
Tanner 
family 

(after having seen 
them 10s or 100s 
of times by that 
point). When I heard about “Fuller 
House,” I thought about one key 
question that the show needed to 
answer: “Why?” Why bring back all 
these characters together besides a 
need for another set of paychecks? 
When watching the new episodes, 
once all the nostalgia from seeing 
all the characters back together 
in their old roles wears off (which 
happened for me around the third 
episode), there’s nothing left to 
support the series. The show is 
sketched around the weakest of 
pretenses and it struggles to tell 
stories with comedic payoff.

“Fuller House” follows a new 

generation of the Tanner family. 
Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin, 
“Full House”) and Kimmy Gib-
bler (Andrea Barber, “Full House”) 
move in with their sister and best 
friend (respectively) D.J. Tanner 
(Candace Cameron Bure, “Full 
House”) to help her raise her three 
sons after seeing the amount of 
stress she was under at a fam-
ily party, paralleling the way Jesse 

(John Stamos, “Full House”) and 
Joey (Dave Coulier, “Full House”) 
moved in with Danny (Bob Saget, 
“Full House”) after his wife died. 
It seems like creator Jeff Franklin 
(who also created and ran “Full 
House”) just said “fuck it” when 
coming up with a story and recre-
ated the same show all over again.

The first episode brings back 

those six, as well as Becky Don-
aldson-Katsopolis (Lori Loughlin, 
“Full House”), and because of this, 
it’s the best of the four I watched. 
It relied on my having watched the 
original to get me involved, calling 
back to some moments and lines 
from the show’s past. I admit, it put 
a smile on my face to hear another, 
“Have mercy!” from Jesse, a “Cut it 
out!” from Joey (though, Coulier’s 
overuse of the phrase on social 
media did diminish the impact 
when hearing it onscreen) and the 
closing use of “The Flintstones” 
’s theme song to put the baby to 
sleep. Also, the best joke came from 
the reunion, where Danny says 
“Michelle is busy running her fash-
ion empire in New York” and the 
entire cast just looks at the camera, 
as if speaking directly to the Olsen 
twins (who declined an opportu-
nity to return). It was the only big 
belly laugh the show got out of me 
during the run.

Once the older actors leave and 

the show is left to the new genera-
tion, “Fuller House” fails to justify 
its existence with shoddily put 
together stories that don’t bring 
any laughs. The fourth episode is 
the first without any of the core 
cast members from “Full House,” 
and it features such illustrious sto-
rylines as kids attempting to break 
out of school and Stephanie getting 

accidentally sprayed by a skunk. 
The jokes and “lessons” surround-
ing these stories are lazy (including 
a scene where we’re supposed to 
laugh at the sight of Stephanie and 
the baby in a barrel of tomato juice) 
and forced in there for the sake of 
having them. There’s a lack of inter-
est in developing any unique or 
original stories, instead taking the 
lazy way out.

It doesn’t help that none of the 

newer generation of actors bring 
any sense of charm or screen pres-
ence. The series features four kids, 
three of D.J.’s and one of Kimmy’s. 
Newcomer Elias Harger, who plays 
D.J.’s middle child Max, gives a 
broad and hammy performance. 
He attacks each joke and punch-
line with enthusiasm, but it’s hard 
for one to land when he’s literally 
shouting it at you. He’s playing to 
the cheap seats in the studio, and 
not to the folks at home. Director 
Mark Cendrowski (“The Big Bang 
Theory”) didn’t reign in his young, 
inexperienced actor enough. In 
addition, twins Dashiell and Fox 
Messitt don’t nearly have the same 
level of cuteness as Mary Kate and 
Ashley Olsen did playing Michelle 
Tanner in the first season of “Full 
House,” and a shot putting the two 
next to one another didn’t help.

“Fuller House” is not a good 

comedy. It fails in pretty much 
every way in building any sort of 
comedic energy from its perfor-
mances or storylines. Because of 
this, the show never really justifies 
a reason for existing. Sure, it brings 
the characters back together, but 
after the others move back to their 
careers, we’re left with nothing 
more than some shells of characters 
and sad attempts at humor.

Netflix

Movies too pricey

By JOE WAGNER

Daily Arts Writer

The price of a movie ticket is 

about 10 bucks these days, and for 
the average Joe, that’s not so easy 
on the wallet — especially when 
I can so easily watch Netflix, 
Amazon Prime Video, HBO GO, 
Showtime, Xfinity TV Go or any 
of the numerous streaming ser-
vices all of which I have already 
paid for. More importantly, I can 
do so from the comfort of my own 
home. The theater must offer 
something special for the modern 
moviegoer, yet it does not.

There was a time in which the 

movie theater was the only place 
where one could go see a movie. 
This time has long come and 
passed. There is something magi-
cal about sitting in a dark room 
with people who you don’t know, 
whose faces you’ve never seen, 
waiting in anticipation to watch 
a story be told. You sit in silence 
while the movie is projected and 
you take in every last detail of the 
film. But quite honestly, is it really 
worth leaving your couch?

The movie theater, try as it 

might, simply can’t compete 
with digital releases. Sure, they 
can make their theaters more 
comfortable by installing cushy 
reclining chairs with refrigerated 
cup holders but it still can’t match 
your own private viewing area. 
The theaters can have waiters 
serve drinks and gourmet food, 
but your kitchen is still closer, 
cheaper and more convenient. 
With the simultaneous releases 
(when films are released digitally 
and theatrically simultaneously) 
happening more frequently, it 
seems the movie theater is losing 
value. Distribution companies 
are realizing that people are lazy, 
that it’s easier and more comfort-
able to watch a movie in one’s 
own home and people are will-
ing to pay the price. Digital first 
releases may be more expensive 
to watch than an older movie but 
the premium price is still likely 
cheaper than movie tickets for 
two.

Additionally, many movies are 

not widely distributed in the-
aters yet interest those who don’t 
have access to them. Digital first 
releases would make art movies, 

which are inaccessible to those 
who don’t live in cities with art 
house theaters, available to many 
more people. This is something 
that is both beneficial for the con-
sumer and the producer.

There will always be die hard 

movie fans who like to enjoy the 
classic cinematic experience. And 
there is something to be said for 
this experience. It is the way most 
films are intended to be watched 
but at this point in time, this way 
of watching movies is antiquated. 
In the modern world, it is difficult 
to carve out time for a trip to the 
movie theater. The modern movie 
watcher wants the ability to 
pause the movie and return to it 
later. The modern movie watcher 
wants control in their hands. The 
modern movie watcher wants a 
smorgasbord of options, all at the 
click of the remote.

The movie theater has lost its 

privileged place within society. 
It is no longer an essential aspect 
of life. It no longer offers a unique 
experience. The movie theater 
must drastically redefine what it 
is, its role and the experience it 
offers or it may cease to exist.

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Since his breakthrough in 2012, 

Macklemore has become a divisive 
artist in the hip-hop community. 
Along with his trusted collabora-
tor Ryan Lewis, 
Macklemore has 
provided teenag-
ers everywhere 
with pop-friend-
ly jams like the 
sing-a-long 
hit 

“Thrift 
Shop,” 

the 
fast-paced 

banger 
“Can’t 

Hold Us” and 
the 
proactive 

LGBTQ anthem 
“Same 
Love.” 

But after his and 
Lewis’s win for Best Rap Album 
at the 2013 Grammys for their 
studio debut The Heist, backlash 
seemed imminent. “Same Love” 
was deemed by some as disingenu-
ous, while many believed Ken-
drick Lamar’s good kid, m.a.a.d. 
city should have won the award. 
However, the biggest surprise 
from the controversy came from 
Macklemore himself, who thought 
he didn’t deserve Best Rap Album 
either. Ultimately, Macklemore’s 
contradicting anxiety and pride 
in his music culminated into his 
sophomore record with Ryan 
Lewis, This Unruly Mess I’ve 
Made. Instead of delivering anoth-
er set of club-ready singles like in 
The Heist, This Unruly Mess I’ve 
Made finds Macklemore attempt-
ing to tackle even larger socially 
conscious themes on an album 
with an ironically apt title.

On the theatrical opener “Light 

Tunnels,” Macklemore contex-
tualizes these conflicted feelings 
about his rap album win with a 
step-by-step description of his 
journey to the Grammys. And 
while the 32-year-old Seattle rap-
per makes a powerful statement 
about the toxicity of fame and 
the artifice of awards shows, he 
stretches the almost 7-minute song 
a bit too long and a bit too thin. 
However, what’s really charging 
Macklemore’s lackluster rhymes 
on “Light Tunnels” is Ryan Lew-
is’s production, which remains 
as engrossing and immaculate as 
ever. Macklemore has the right to 
be upset with how the media and 
society treats him so harshly, but 
that doesn’t necessarily mean he 
should be so apologetic that he 
can’t just take credit for an award 
that he believed he didn’t deserve.

Macklemore’s internal conflict 

continues to be a recurring theme 
on the album. After he dramatical-
ly closes the first act, Macklemore 
enters into the bright and flashy 
“Downtown,” an instrumentally 
overblown and lyrically slipshod 
track that starts out as an ode 
to mopeds and then transforms 
abruptly into a Hamilton-esque 
anthem. Simply put, it’s a poor 

man’s “Thrift Shop.” It does have 
its moments, but most of them 
don’t even involve Macklemore; 
they come from the song’s breath-
taking features, which include old-
school hip-hop legends Melle Mel, 
Kool Moe Dee and Grandmaster 
Caz as well as Foxy Shazam vocal-
ist Eric Nally, whose shrieking 
falsetto heightens “Downtown” ’s 
unsteady ambition. However, the 
album doesn’t seem to get better 
from there.

The overtly silly “Brad Pitt’s 

Cousin” has Macklemore making 
absurd quips about his cat’s Ins-
tagram, his dick (he calls it “Ron 
Burgundy”) and even makes a 
Deez Nuts reference. “Buckshot” 
’s hip-hop heavy production and 
skilled guests (Bronx rapper KRS-
One and Kanye West collabora-
tor DJ Premier) is dampered by 
Macklemore’s nonsensical rap-
ping and an annoying, whiny 
whistle sample that buzzes in the 
song’s background like a crying 
baby on an airplane. After “Buck-
shot” finishes, Fun Macklemore 
suddenly shifts into Contempla-
tive Macklemore with a trio of 
maudlin ballads, “Growing Up,” 
“Kevin” and “St. Ides.” Mackl-
emore’s well-intentioned message 
to his baby son on “Growing Up” 
has a sweet center and notable 
pop singer Ed Sheeran delivers a 
soaring chorus, though the song 
is a note too sentimental. Leon 
Bridges offers some strong vocals 
on “Kevin” but struggles to elevate 
the song’s clichéd lyrics (“Doc-
tor, please/Give me a dose of the 
American Dream”). “St. Ides,” the 
only song off the album without a 
feature, is in dire need of one.

Though the album struggles to 

maintain a balance between corny 
raps and mature songs, Mackl-
emore finds some form of the-
matic and sonic stability on “Need 
to Know,” the only real highlight 
on This Unruly Mess I’ve Made. 
A surprisingly poignant song, 
“Need to Know” is bolstered by 
Lewis’s piano-laden instrumental, 
Macklemore’s lyrics about drug 
addiction and an incredible guest 
verse from Chance the Rapper. It’s 
a track that reminds Macklemore 
fans of how positive and influen-
tial hip hop can be, especially with 
the right words and production.

Among the broad spectrum 

of white hip-hop artists — from 
laughable acts (Hoodie Allen, Iggy 
Azalea, Riff Raff) to mainstream 
artists (G-Eazy, Logic, Mac Mill-
er) to rap veterans (Eminem, 
Action Bronson, El-P) — Mackl-
emore is uneasily somewhere 
in the middle. He is, at most, a 
decent rapper. His charisma and 
tongue-in-cheek demeanor shines 
more than his storytelling. He 
and Lewis are certainly prolific 
in their music making, since both 
this record and The Heist were 
independently self-produced, self-
recorded and self-released by the 
duo. But in terms of how Mackl-

emore approaches his material, 
he’s a bit shaky and This Unruly 
Mess I’ve Made is a perfect 
example of that. Most of the “fun” 
songs aren’t very catchy and most 
of the “mature” songs aren’t very 
nuanced. Perhaps Macklemore’s 
difficulty in articulating his ideas 
can be simplified in the album’s 
final track “White Privilege II,” a 
lengthy, often confounding song 
in which Macklemore struggles 
to identify with the #BlackLives-
Matter movement while being a 
white man in America. Mackl-
emore definitely has the right 
intentions, but his execution in 
conveying them makes for a truly 
unruly mess.

MUSIC REVIEW


Jazzy Lenachka

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

First off, I’d like to discuss the 

fact that it is unseasonably warm 
outside. While I love leaving my 
parka at home as much as the next 
person, I’m convinced that global 
warming is on its way to kill us all. 
However, as spring approaches, I 
was in need of something slightly 
more uplifting than my depressing 
January playlist on Spotify. This, 
my fellow friends, is what lead me 
to Lenachka.

Helene Immel is a 22-year-old 

singer/songwriter, first discovered 
in 2012 by producer Charlie Pea-
cock when her cover of “Safe & 
Sound” by Taylor Swift, featuring 
the Civil Wars, caught his atten-
tion. Born in Germany to a Rus-
sian family, she immigrated to the 
United States with her parents 
when she was just 8 years old. Her 
stage name, Lenachka, is a com-
mon name of endearment used by 
Russian mothers. Now working in 
both L.A., and Nashville, Lenachka 
continues to write with many song-
writers and producers. She cur-
rently lives in L.A. where she has 
formed her own band.

Lenachka released her first self-

titled debut EP in 2014, leading 

with “Breaking Down.” Starting 
with simple echoes and sweet gui-
tar strumming, “Breaking Down” 
remains subdued until its swell at 
the chorus. Lenachka addresses 
returning home when she sings, “I 
thought I found my way back home 
/ Going to the place that I know / 
But I’ll find it anyhow.” By adding 
traditional string instruments like 
violins, she puts a classic twist on 
an otherwise light pop song. By 
the time the bridge picks up with 
quicker beats to illustrate running 
away and finding herself, Lenach-
ka has the listener hooked. 

“Good Luck” initially feels edgy 

and jazzy, with an electric gui-
tar and techno beat that pick up 
halfway through. Lenachka drags 
the boy that wronged her when 
she sings, “You keep saying that 
you miss me / While you’re with 
another girl / I can’t believe I let 
you kiss me / No time for games 
in my world.” Conversely, “I Want 
to Love You” sounds like a tribute 
to Lady Antebellum. Heavy drum-
beats, echoing layers and delicate 
vocals showcase Lenachka’s voice. 
By keeping the instrumentals sub-
dued while she sings, her voice is 
able to soar when she muses, “I 
want to love you / The corners of 
your heart no one’s been to.”

Initially sounding extremely 

techno before segueing into quick 
electric guitar riffs, “Go Slow” 
sounds much rockier than the 
other songs. Lenachka’s ethe-
real voice creates a juxtaposition 
between the confiding lyrics and 
heavy, quick instruments. Closing 
with my personal favorite, “Edge 
of New York” uses sweet vocals, 
snaps and nostalgic lyrics that 
simultaneously speak on moving 
forward. She intertwines tradi-
tional New York scenery to apply 
to her message of continuing on 
with or without someone. It is a 
pop song that doesn’t sound too 
sugary or upbeat, while the bridge 
sounds straight out of a Sara 
Bareilles song. When Lenachka 
sings, “I’m on the edge of New 
York / With my back to the water,” 
it feels like she’s on the precipice of 
something larger than the listener 
can understand.

Lenachka sums herself up in her 

Facebook bio far better than I ever 
could, saying, “I speak Russian & 
my English should be better. I love 
flat soda & the Investigation Dis-
covery channel. I have six other 
younger siblings, they are the best. 
I take way to many bubble baths. 
I think cleaning helps me think. I 
make music.”

JACK Quartet a new 
spin on string music

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

In the classical music genre, 

musicians often become spe-
cialized in one or two particu-
lar types of performance. While 
the majority of conservatory 
performance 
students 
dream of a solo 
career, only a 
small number 
actually 
end 

up touring the 
world, 
play-

ing with one 
orchestra 
one night and 
another 
the 

night 
after. 

As they move into the life of a 
working musician, most former 
students will filter into other 
roles — a fact which, while ini-
tially upsetting to some young 
musicians, is actually quite 
beneficial. This diversification 
allows for the development of a 
more nuanced artistic relation-
ship between the musician and 
their close confreres and gener-
ally results in more interesting 
music (note that none of this 
is meant to disparage the role 
of the soloist, but only to point 
out that other musical paths are 
equally as valid and meritori-
ous). Some musicians become 
accompanists, others orches-
tral players, some church musi-
cians, many chamber players 
— some people even manage to 
be more than one.

One of the most exciting 

types of ensembles appear-
ing today is the “new music” 
ensemble, a group of musi-
cians dedicated to performing 
the music of living or recently 
living composers. The preced-
ing years have seen the rise of 
many such groups — a few of 
the more prominent include 
eighth blackbird (which won 
a Grammy Award this year for 
the album Filament), Alarm 
Will Sound and yMusic — many 
of which play with stunning 
vitality. One such engaging 
ensemble is the JACK Quartet, 
which will be performing in 
Ann Arbor this Tuesday at the 
Walgreen Drama Center.

“We met at Eastman School 

of Music [at the University of 
Rochester],” JACK’s violinist 
Ari Steisfeld said in an inter-
view with the Michigan Daily.

“Eastman, at the time we 

were there — and I don’t think 
it’s changed too much — had a 
really vibrant community of 
student performers performing 
contemporary music, and we 
were part of that community.”

Founding the ensemble in 

2007, the initiators of the JACK 
Quartet — John Pickford Rich-
ards, Ari Streisfeld, Christo-
pher Otto and Kevin McFarland 
(the quartet’s name is derived 
from the first letter of each of 
their names) — were brought 
together by a mutual enthusi-
asm for new music.

“There were just tons and 

tons of contemporary music 
concerts happening [at East-
man] … and it was just real-
ly exciting.” Streisfeld said. 
“Those concerts were actually 
probably the most well attend-
ed concerts at Eastman, by the 
students but even by people 
outside the school. There was 
just this incredible excitement 
about contemporary music.”

However, it wasn’t until the 

future quartet members gradu-
ated from college that they 
decided to form an ensemble 
together.

“We played together at East-

man — not necessarily as a 
quartet that many times, but 
just in different formations,” 
Streisfeld said. “When we all 
graduated 
some 
opportuni-

ties came our way to play as a 
quartet and it kind of built from 
there. There was never a ques-
tion about what we wanted to 
do; it was very clear to us from 
the beginning that contem-
porary music should be our 
focus.”

In addition to performing, 

JACK also participates in many 
educational events for young 
composers. As part of the Wil-
liam Bolcom Residency this 
week at the University of Mich-
igan School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, the quartet will also 
be teaching a master class and 
reading works by student com-
posers.

During the summer, JACK 

has a residency at New Music 
on the Point, a festival in Ver-
mont. As part of this festival, 
the quartet works with student 
composers to workshop and 
perform 
new 
compositions. 

Carolina Heredia, who is cur-
rently a graduate student at the 
University, was one such com-
poser, and JACK will be pre-
miering her piece “Ausencias/
Ausências/Absences” for string 
quartet and electronic media 
on Tuesday’s concert.

“[Heredia] has gone on sev-

eral trips to different countries 
in South America — she’s from 
Argentina — but she’s trav-
elled to Chile and some other 
countries in South America, 
and has made field recordings 
while there of various musics,” 
Streisfeld said, describing the 
material used for the electronic 
media in the piece.

The first piece on JACK’s 

program for Tuesday night, 
however, 
is 
John 
Luther 

Adams’s “The Wind in High 
Places,” a hypnotizingly beau-
tiful work composed in 2011 
which is soporific (in the best 
sense of the word) and anodyne 
when compared to much of the 
more “aggressive” and “spiky” 
music of the 20th and 21st cen-
tury.

“John Luther Adams has 

become a very, very famous 
composer — he just won the 
Pulitzer Prize [in 2014] and 
Grammies and things like that 
… we started playing [‘The 

Wind in High Places’] several 
years ago, and then we record-
ed it with [Adams], and that 
recording came out last year 
and has done very well,” Stre-
isfeld said.

“It’s a piece that we really 

enjoy playing, and the whole 
idea of the piece is that we never 
actually depress our strings,” 
he continued. “The whole piece 
is made up of open strings and 
harmonics, so you never actu-
ally push the strings down, you 
only touch the strings, and it’s 
really a kind of ethereal sound 
world that he’s created.”

Following the performance 

of the Adams, the quartet will 
take an intermission before 
beginning the rest of the con-
cert, including a piece by Car-
oline Shaw, a Pulitzer Prize 
winning composer. 

“[The 
piece 
being 
per-

formed] is a quartet that she 
wrote for us, that’s actually 
based on a larger work she orig-
inally composed for her ensem-
ble Roomful of Teeth, which is 
an ensemble of eight voices,” 
Streisfeld said. “And so she 
made a string quartet version 
of this piece called ‘Ritornello’ 
which takes opening harmo-
nies from [Claudio] Montever-
di’s [L]’Orfeo — a very famous 
early opera — and then expands 
those harmonies in ways that 
kind of reimagine them.”

The conclusion of the con-

cert will provide a striking 
contrast to the first pieces on 
the program. Unlike the Adams 
work, the final piece will 
serve to exemplify the kind of 
“aggressive” and “spiky” music 
which many listeners have 
come to associate with the 
20th and 21st centuries. How-
ever, these adjectives should 
not necessarily be regarded 
with entailing the usual nega-
tive connotations associated 
with them, but rather as mere 
aesthetic descriptors of a music 
which is complex, innovative 
and startlingly beautiful.

“On the end of the program 

we’ll be playing a piece which 
we’ve probably played the most 
of anything in our repertoire,” 
Streisfeld said. “ It’s called 
‘Tratras,’ by Greek composer 
Iannis Xenakis, and it’s a crazy 
piece. It involves all sorts of 
extended techniques, and it’s 
kind of 15-16 minutes of pure 
energy … it’s a very exciting 
work.”

Speaking to the appeal of 

specializing in contemporary 
music, Streisfeld explained the 
excitement that accompanies 
the work the quartet does.

“Being part of the creation 

of new work, being the ini-
tial interpreters of new piece, 
bringing it to life is very excit-
ing,” he said. “Collaborating 
with composers both young 
and old of all different kinds 
is a really exciting experience, 
you’re kind of on the ground 
floor with some brand new 
idea.”

Make Michigan basketball great again
A

nother regular season 
ended for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team 

Saturday night, and Michigan 
once again 
isn’t in posi-
tion to make 
the NCAA 
Tournament.

The Wol-

verines just 
can’t stop los-
ing.

It seems, 

based upon 
social media, 
as if a small 
segment of the fanbase has 
decided it’s time to move on 
from Michigan coach John 
Beilein, and on to bigger and 
better things. Michigan basket-
ball, they seem to imply, needs 
to be great again — needs to win 
again.

They’re absolutely right, but 

Michigan has to be careful in 
making its next hire. It can’t 
mess up again like it did when it 
hired Beilein, the guy who has 
the third-most wins in program 
history, has led the Wolverines 
to the Final Four and the Elite 
Eight in the last four years and 
has had five NBA draft picks in 
the same time period. Clearly, 
there’s only one man who can 
fix all of this losing. He might 
be a little busy right now, and he 
has never coached basketball, 
but who needs free time or basic 
knowledge of Xs and Os when 
you can win at everything?

Enter Donald Trump, future 

Michigan basketball coach.

Coach Trump, as you know, 

will be a winner. His Michigan 
teams will beat everybody.

Michigan State, Ohio State 

and Indiana won’t stand a 
chance. If anything, Michigan 
fans will get bored of all of the 
winning.

“Remember that Beilein 

guy who only took us to one 
National Championship Game? 

That was cute and fun,” they’ll 
say as they wear hats with the 
word “Trump” on the front and 
a block ‘M’ on the back.

After hiring Coach Trump 

in the upcoming offseason, 
Michigan will win the next 
seven national titles, including a 
historic victory over the Chinese 
national team in the 2022 NCAA 
Tournament. China, the world 
will learn, never beats Coach 
Trump.

And forget about politically 

correct coachspeak. After Sat-
urday’s game, Beilein took time 
out of his postgame press con-
ference to praise his opponent. 
Who wants to hear that after a 
devastating loss?

Coach Trump will say what’s 

on his mind. He isn’t beholden to 

anyone: Not Big Ten commission-
er Jim Delaney, not the NCAA, 
not anybody. If he wants to com-
pare Tom Crean to a part of the 
female anat-
omy, he’ll do 
it. The NCAA 
could attempt 
to punish 
him, but it 
won’t matter. 
Coach Trump’s 
Michigan 
won’t rely on 
NCAA money, 
anyway. He’ll 
use his own 
cash to grow the program into 
something great, just like he built 
his empire off his father’s small 
million-dollar loan.

On the court, Michigan’s 

playing style will change. 
You’re sick and tired of the 
Wolverines failing to develop 
dominant big men, right? Those 

guys will grow 
on trees under 
Coach Trump.

Nobody, 

after all, 
knows the 
importance 
of size better 
than Coach 
Trump. Michi-
gan’s players 
are going to be 
yuuuge. 

And don’t even get Coach 

Trump started on how long his 
players’ fingers will be. Rich-
ard Bighands, a 2021 five-star 
recruit, will be able to palm 

three basketballs with his right 
hand. Michigan players will 
have the biggest hands.

Coach Trump will undoubt-

edly bring a sense of account-
ability that the program is 
lacking. Michigan is supposed 
to be the leaders and the best, 
right? It’s time to start taking 
the fight song more seriously.

If players miss shots, Coach 

Trump will utter his famous 
catchphrase: “You’re fired.” 
(Coach Trump doesn’t fully 
understand how scholarships 
work.) Excuses won’t fly under 
his regime.

People will do whatever 

Coach Trump tells them to. He 
will assemble the finest staff 
in the world. Dennis Rodman 
and Chris Christie will be his 

assistant coaches, and Dr. Ben 
Carson, a graduate of Michi-
gan’s medical school, will come 
home to be the team doctor. No 
Michigan player will ever get 
injured again.

After Coach Trump’s third 

national title, Crisler Center 
will become “Trump Center.” 
After his seventh, Jim Har-
baugh Stadium, formerly known 
as Michigan Stadium, will be 
renamed “Trump Stadium.” 
Harbaugh, who will have won 
just three national titles by then 
— a statistic for which Coach 
Trump will frequently make 
fun of him — will wear only 
Trump-brand khakis.

Coach Trump will retire 

after the 2023 season to work 
on his new reality TV show, 
“Tanning with Rich People.”

But before he leaves, Coach 

Trump will take action to give 
Michigan the best in-stadium 
experience the best, too, by 
expanding the Maize Rage. 
Sure, Michigan will lose money 
from all of the donors who pay 
big money to sit close to the 
court, but the logistics of the 
situation will make too much 
sense to ignore.

The Athletic Department, 

led by Coach Trump, will build 
a huge wall — a massive wall — 
around the new Maize Rage to 
make sure nobody other than 
Michigan students can get in. If 
any opposing fans try to sneak 
in, the Crisler ushers — armed 
with tasers, handguns and 
bazookas — will use any force 
necessary to send them back 
to their seats. Michigan State’s 
“Go Green, Go White” chant 
will never again be heard in the 
arena’s lower bowl.

And who’s going to pay for 

this wall, you ask? Seven letters: 
T-O-M I-Z-Z-O.

‘M’ falls to Buckeyes in overtime

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

COLUMBUS 
— 
After 
the 

Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 
7-4 

loss to Ohio State on Friday, in 
which it gave up six unanswered 
goals, coach Red Berenson said 
the seventh-ranked Wolverines 
couldn’t put themselves in a hole 
and expect 
to 
come 

back.

Sunday 

afternoon, at Nationwide Arena 
in Columbus, Berenson found 
himself saying the same exact 
thing at the end of the game, as 
the Wolverines recovered from 
a three-goal deficit in the first 
period only to lose to the Buckeyes 
in overtime, 6-5.

“You can’t come on the road 

against a team like this and 
expect to come from behind from 
three-goal and two-goal deficits,” 
Berenson said. “It’s disappointing. 
I liked the way our team battled 
back in the third period, but 
we just gave them too many 
opportunities.”

Ohio 
State’s 
first-period 

scoring barrage started when 
senior forward Justin Selman 
was sent to the penalty box for 
interference.

Buckeye 
forward 
Dakota 

Joshua 
found 
himself 
open 

inside the left circle and ripped 
a shot toward the net. The puck 
hit the left post, beating senior 
goaltender Steve Racine on its 
way into the net to give Ohio State 
the lead.

The Buckeyes added two more 

goals in the period, both coming 
off Michigan miscues.

Sophomore defenseman Sam 

Piazza misplayed a bouncing 
puck, which allowed Ohio State 
forward Brendon Kearney to 
collect the puck and skate by him. 
Kearney rounded Racine with a 
deke and poked the puck home on 
his backhand.

Ohio State scored its third 

goal when forward Nick Schilkey 
caught 
freshman 
defenseman 

Nicholas Boka flat-footed, skating 
by Boka to give him a breakaway 
on Racine. Schilkey didn’t miss, 
and the Buckeyes went into the 
break up by three goals.

“We’re 
saying 
one 
thing 

and doing another on the ice,” 
Berenson said. “We’re just not 
playing well enough without 
the puck, and we got exposed 
defensively in the first period. 
They could’ve had five goals in the 
first period.”

For the first six minutes of the 

second period, the Wolverines 
looked determined to start the 
comeback, 
something 
they’ve 

done many times before this 
season. Sophomore defenseman 
Zach Werenski cut the deficit to 
two on the power play when he 
beat Buckeye goaltender Matt 
Tomkins from the point. But 
Michigan’s inability to clear the 
defensive zone came back to bite 
them again, and Ohio State scored 
two more goals via the sticks 
of forward Mason Jobst and 
defenseman Craig Dalrymple to 
stretch its lead to four.

“We’re all saying we’re trying to 

play better defensively,” Berenson 
said. “But it’s not showing up. 
It’s not showing up in our goals-
against, our chances-against or 
our shots-against.

“We’ve 
gotta 
play 
better 

defensive hockey.”

The 
Wolverines 
wouldn’t 

go away, though. Later in the 
game, sophomore forward Tony 
Calderone cut the deficit to two 
with a backhand shot from the 
slot.

Michigan 
carried 
the 

momentum into the third period, 
as Werenski added his second of 
the game to cut the deficit to one, 
and freshman forward Cooper 
Marody tied the game with less 
than five minutes remaining in 
the game.

“Selman made an unbelievable 

play around the (defenseman),” 
Marody said. “I came off the 
bench and went backdoor, and 
the puck kind of just came to me. 
I knew the goalie was going to 
slide over, so I tried to put it on the 
other side (of the net).

With 2:07 left in the game, the 

Wolverines thought they had the 
game winner when Selman tipped 
a shot in front of the net. But after 
a lengthy official review, the 
referees waved off the goal, ruling 
that Selman used a high stick to 
tip the puck in, and the two teams 
went into overtime tied at five.

In overtime, Schilkey scored 

to give the Buckeyes the win on a 
broken play that saw Racine stop 
two point-blank chances.

Racine tried to poke the puck 

off Schilkey’s stick, but was 
unsuccessful, and fell to the ice, 
which gave Schilkey an open 
net to end the game in the extra 
period.

“For two guys to be in front of 

the net, me and JT, for (Schilkey) 
to find a way to put it in there is 
pretty heartbreaking,” Werenski 
said. “But it’s hockey, and we’re 
going to have to bounce back 
here.”

After a dominating 6-2 win 

at 
Minnesota 
last 
Thursday, 

Michigan seemed to have put 
itself in the driver’s seat for the 
Big Ten regular season title.

But with three straight losses 

since then, the Wolverines will 
head into the final weekend of the 
regular season clinging to the No. 
2 seed and the last first round bye 
in the Big Ten Tournament.

And if this past weekend is an 

indication of anything, Michigan 
still has a lot of work to do to earn 
that bye.

Racine struggles, 
gives up six in loss

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

Exactly 
three 
weeks 
ago, 

senior Michigan netminder Steve 
Racine was playing the best 
hockey of his life — and he knew 
it.

“It’s my last year,” Racine said 

after a weekday practice. “All the 
seniors will say that they want 
to go out on the right foot. Just 
focusing every day and enjoying 
it seems to be working well.”

But this weekend’s home-and-

home series against Ohio State 
put that dream of a ride into the 
sunset on ice.

Friday night, the Wolverines 

were 
leading 
2-0, 
looking 

to cruise past their inferior 
competition. But the Buckeyes 
tallied six unanswered goals 
and left Yost with a 6-2 victory. 
After stopping just 14 of 19 shots 
he faced, Michigan coach Red 
Berenson pulled Racine for the 
first time all season.

Racine got the starting nod 

again for Sunday’s contest, but 
the jitters were still there. In his 
disappointing games, the senior 
tends to sink back into his net and 
look unsure with his glove.

After 
giving 
up 
three 

unanswered goals in the first 20 
minutes, Racine’s second period 
was one of his worst stretches on 
the year. He looked downright 
uncomfortable in net — fanning 
at the fourth goal as it fluttered 
in the air while every shot on 
goal seemed to be a threat to go 
in.

But Michigan stuck with him 

and it nearly paid off.

“I thought it was a chance for 

him to bounce back and for our 
team to bounce back,” Berenson 
said. “I can’t tell you he didn’t. 
They had two breakaways in 
the first period and three two-
on-ones — too many odd-man 
rushes. He probably kept us in 
the game.

“He’s been our starting goalie. 

Whether or not we make that 
change, its hard to say, but right 

now he’s giving us a chance.”

A rally in the final minute 

of the second period pulled 
the Wolverines to within two, 
and Racine stood on his head 
as Michigan battled to tie the 
game. At the end of regulation, 
the senior had three point-blank 
stops that nearly saved the game 
singlehandedly.

But it was heartbreak in the 

end.

In the overtime period, Racine 

stopped an initial attempt as 
sophomore 
defender 
Zach 

Werenski chased down Buckeye 
forward Nick Schilkey. He batted 
away another on the follow-
up, leaving a puck dangling by 
the top of the circle with three 
Wolverines on the ice behind the 
net.

“The next thing I know,” 

Schilkey 
said, 
“I’m 
coming 

around the net and I see the 
goalie (Racine) coming out after 
it. It was a foot race and I think, 
‘I got him.’ ”

Shilkey picked Racine’s pocket 

and blasted a puck between the 
flailing bodies of Werenski and 
junior forward JT Compher. 
Racine was sprawled on his 
stomach in the slot.

After clawing all the way 

back, Michigan was 0-2 on the 
weekend.

“It is tough,” said freshman 

forward Cooper Marody. “I mean 
that’s hockey. He’s been playing 
great for us all year. People might 
criticize him for some goals he 
let up, but, hey, the kid’s been 
battling for us all year.”

It was easy to believe that 

Racine could ride out the season 
as a new player and maybe even 
a hero — but feel-good endings 
don’t come easy in college hockey.

After dropping three of their 

last four, the Wolverines are in 
serious trouble, and they need 
their golden goaltender back. 
Any illusions of an easy finish for 
Racine are dashed, but he is the 
starting goaltender, and there’s 
still a chance to keep that dream 
of riding off into the sunset alive.

Michigan falls early in Indianapolis

Iowa storms back 
to oust Wolverines 
in first round of Big 

Ten Tournament

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

INDIANAPOLIS — Both the 

Michigan and Iowa women’s 
basketball teams held double-
digit 
leads 

as 
they 

faced off to 
open the Big 
Ten Tournament, but it was the 
latter that lasted until the end.

The Hawkeyes powered back 

from a 16-point deficit to build an 
equally commanding lead of their 
own, and they never let Michigan 
back into the game for a 97-85 win.

The Wolverines trailed by 

just eight going into the fourth 
quarter, but 35-percent shooting 
in the last 10 minutes prevented 
them from crawling back.

Michigan had been in that 

position before, even against 
Iowa. At home in January, the 
Wolverines trailed Iowa by 17 and 
came back to win. Early in the 
fourth quarter Thursday, they cut 
the lead to just two.

“We hit a couple shots and 

pulled within, but because we 
didn’t get the stops, we weren’t 
able to convert on the offensive 
end,” said senior guard Madison 
Ristovski, who had 10 points, four 
rebounds and four assists.

A simple defensive change from 

Iowa was the difference maker.

It became clear from the 

opening tip that the Hawkeyes 
hadn’t assigned the right matchup 
to Michigan freshman center 
Hallie Thome.

Iowa forward Chase Coley 

guarded Thome in the first 
quarter, but during that stretch 
the Wolverine center had 11 
points, two offensive rebounds, a 
block and a steal.

Iowa 
coach 
Lisa 
Bluder 

adjusted the matchup, giving 
freshman 
forward 
Megan 

Gustafson a bigger share of the 
responsibility, and she completely 
flipped the script.

Gustafson 
played 
more 

physical against Thome, and she 
personally outscored Thome 11-4 
in the Hawkeyes’ second-quarter 
run. Gustafson finished with a 
career-high 25 points as well as 10 
rebounds, just one of Iowa’s three 
double-doubles Thursday.

Whenever 
the 
Wolverines’ 

guards were on the wing and 
looking to make an entry pass 
to the post, the other defender, 
either Gustafson or Coley, sagged 
behind Thome, ready to double-
team Michigan’s inside scorer.

“The double team took my 

game over,” Thome said. “I saw 
(Coley and Gustafson) rotate back 
and forth, but a lot throughout 
the game they would come over 

and double. Chase is kind of a 
short player, so you can attack 
her more. Whereas Megan, you 
want to do the up-and-under’s to 
get around her feet.”

With two players of Thome’s 

size, Iowa’s post presence wore 
her down, as they continued to 
attack her on both the offensive 
and defensive end. She scored just 
four points in the remainder of 
the game.

As Thome began to struggle, 

the Hawkeyes took advantage. 
Iowa crushed Michigan in the 
second quarter, 31-13, stealing the 
lead behind a dominant showing 
from guard Ally Disterhoft.

For about eight minutes on 

Thursday, Michigan was leaving 
Iowa in its dust.

But then Bluder made the switch 

from Coley to Gustafson, and Iowa 
fought back. While Iowa advanced 
to play Friday, Michigan will likely 
head to the WNIT.

Foul trouble limits 
Thompson in wild 

loss to ninth-

seeded Hawkeyes

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

INDIANAPOLIS — With 3:17 

remaining in the first quarter Siera 
Thompson committed her third 
foul in as many minutes. Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico had no 
choice but to take her out for the 
remainder of the first half of the 
Wolverines’ Big Ten Tournament 
game against Iowa.

With the junior guard on the 

bench, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team had to make do 
without its best defender, and the 
Hawkeyes capitalized. Though 
Iowa was held to 21 points in 

the first quarter, the Hawkeyes 
exploded for 31 in the second, 
putting the Wolverines in a hole 
they were never able to claw their 
way out of.

As Michigan’s No. 1 defender, 

Thompson 
is 
often 
charged 

with shadowing the opponent’s 
biggest offensive threat. Against 
Iowa that meant her assignment 
was guard Ally Disterhoft who 
averages 36.3 minutes and 16.9 
points per game.

While guarded by Thompson 

in the first quarter, Disterhoft 
scored just two points. But with 
Thompson sidelined, Disterhoft 
made the Wolverines pay, racking 
up 15 points with Thompson out 
of the game, including 11 in the 
second quarter, to finish the first 
half with 17. Disterhoft’s hot 
shooting, including 4-for-4 from 
beyond the 3-point line, spread 
to the rest of her teammates as 
well. As a team, Iowa shot 81 

percent from the floor in the 
second quarter.

“We got some really good 

percentage shots,” said Iowa 
coach Lisa Bluder. “You know 
when things are falling for you 
— and again (Disterhoft) made 
some great 3s to bring us back into 
this — but you know it’s kind of 
contagious. Shooting’s contagious 
and I think once you start feeling 
it, everybody feels it.” 

Without Thompson, Michigan 

was not only without its top 
defender, but it also had to find a 
way to make up for her offensive 
output. 
Thompson 
leads 
the 

Wolverines with 151 assists on 
the season. Without her running 
the offense, Michigan — which 
scored 29 points in the first 
quarter — was unable to keep pace 
with Iowa, totaling just 13 points 
in the second frame.

As the game progressed to its 

final stages Thompson gained 
the freedom to be more and more 
aggressive, since she had not 
committed a foul in the second 
half, and she shifted back to 
her role as Disterhoft’s primary 
defender. Back in her original 
role, Thompson once again shut 
down Disterhoft, who scored just 
five points in the second half and 
finished the game with 22.

The offense was also able to 

get back on track with Thompson 
back in charge. The Wolverines 
were just two points shy of 
matching Iowa’s second half 
scoring total of 45 points with 
Thompson 
contributing 
eight 

points, three rebounds and four 
assists throughout the contest — 
though she eventually fouled out 
with 1:12 left in the game.

The second-half rally wasn’t 

enough for Michigan to overcome 
its second quarter hole, and Iowa 
finished off the win, 97-85.

“We’re at the point now, if 

someone comes out, other people 
have an opportunity to step 
up,” Barnes Arico said. “And 
we weren’t really able to take 
advantage of that today.”

Freshman guard Boogie Brozoski scored eight points to go along with six rebounds and four assists in the Michigan women’s basketball team’s loss Thursday.

‘M’ falls short on beam against Utes

By LANEY BYLER

Daily Sports Writer

On the night when a win 

could have meant the most, the 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team dropped the ball — or rather, 
they dropped off the beam.

With the meet being Senior 

Night and the last regular-season 
home meet, success could have 
meant a lot more than just another 
win to an already impressive 9-3 
record. The championship season 
is approaching quickly, so a win 
for the fifth-ranked Wolverines 
against No. 6 Utah would have 
been the positive reinforcement 
they 
needed 
before 
the 
big 

tournaments, especially after last 
week’s loss to No. 1 Oklahoma. 
Instead, multiple falls on beam 
spoiled Michigan’s hopes, 197.525-
197.050.

The 
first 
fall 
came 
from 

sophomore Lauren Marinez mid-
routine, and it followed her for the 
rest of the event. The remainder of 
her routine saw a slew of bobbles, 
and she ended with a score of 
8.900. It was a sharp contrast 
from her performance last week 
against the Sooners, where she 
posted a career-high 9.925.

Marinez sat in the middle of 

the lineup for beam, so there 
were high hopes that the rest of 
the team could repair the damage 
done to the team score. Senior 
Lindsay Williams posted a 9.875 
immediately therafter, and junior 
Nicole Artz followed with a 9.925. 
Junior Talia Chiarelli served 
as anchor for the beam as one 
of Michigan’s most prominent 
athletes for the event. She had 
already secured first place on the 
vault with a 9.900.

Chiarelli, who was voted Big 

Ten event specialist of the week 
for the beam earlier in the season, 
took the second fall for the 
Wolverines. Near the end of her 
routine, she rushed an acrobatic 
sequence which ended in a full fall 
off of the beam. She finished with 
a final score of 9.325.

“I’m still in shock that the 

two athletes that had a fall on 
beam have been two of my top 
consistent beam performers all 
season,” said Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki. “I don’t really know 
if it was just a fluky thing or the 

pressure. In another event, you 
can have a tiny stumble and cover 
it up and move on, but if you have 
the slightest bobble on beam, it’s 
only four inches wide — it doesn’t 
take much to be on the floor.”

While the beam was definitively 

the downfall for Michigan, the 
Wolverines managed to come 
back from their major deductions 
for a final score of 197.050, which 
is surprisingly close to what 
Michigan 
scores 
on 
average 

without falls on beam. Despite the 
loss, multiple Wolverines were 
able to contribute immensely to 
Michigan’s final-score comeback, 
including Williams, Artz, senior 
Austin Sheppard and freshman 
Olivia Karas.

It’s no surprise the seniors 

were on top of their game during 
Senior 
Night. 
Williams 
and 

Sheppard both had phenomenal 
performances on the uneven bars, 
where Williams tied for fourth 
with a 9.900 alongside Karas. 
Sheppard came in at sixth with a 
9.875. Williams went on for fifth 
on the beam with another 9.875, 
and seventh on the floor, tying 
her career-best of 9.850. While 

Williams was making a splash 
on floor and beam, Sheppard was 
dominating on the vault, taking 
third with a 9.875.

Despite the strong presence 

offered by the seniors, it was Artz 
who stole the show with four first-
place scores. After a rough couple 
of weeks on the bars, where she 
was injured multiple times, Artz 
was able to come back and take 
first with a career-high 9.975. 
She followed with a solid beam 
routine, earning first place with 
a 9.925. In the final rotation for 
Michigan, Artz tied her career-
best on the floor with a 9.975, to 
earn an overall score of 39.725, 
enough to take first in the all-
around as well.

Karas followed closely behind, 

taking third in the all-around 
with a 39.500. She had a driven 
floor routine, where she stuck 
landings on all of her tumbling 
passes, including an impressive 
double Arabian. She finalized a 
floor score of 9.925, taking second 
to Artz. In addition to tying 
Williams for fourth on the uneven 
bars, she also tied Artz for fifth on 
the vault.

“Overall, I thought it was a 

great meet against a great team, 
and you can’t make mistakes 
against a great team and come 
out victorious. We knew that 
coming in,” Plocki said. “This is 
exactly what we need, though. 
This is why I like going against 
the best teams in the country, 
because we need to be put in 
these situations.

“We need to understand that 

if we had made one more beam 
routine, we would have won the 
meet and walked away with the 
highest score of the season, and 
those are two really important 
things. Sometimes you learn 
that lesson the hard way, but 
sometimes learning it the hard 
way is what motivates you to go 
back into the gym and make sure 
it doesn’t happen again.”

With Big Ten Championships 

and the NCAA Championships 
around the corner, the Wolverines 
don’t have much time to make 
sure it doesn’t happen again. 
Michigan will have to work hard 
to repair its confidence, especially 
on the beam, after such a close 
loss to Utah.

Junior Nicole Artz scored a career-high 39.725 in the all-around, the 11th-best mark in school history.

Michigan finishes 3-3 
over busy Spring Break

Wolverines beat 

San Jose State, fall 
to UC Davis to close 
out West Coast trip

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

Just two weeks into the 

season, the Michigan baseball 
team was ready for its busiest 
week on the schedule.

The 20th-ranked Wolverine 

baseball 
team 
headed 
to 

northern California in search of 
sunny weather to cap an eight-
game, nine-day trip. Their final 
two contests were canceled 
due to rain, but Michigan 
still played six games. The 
Wolverines (7-3) broke even 
over the break, going 3-3.

After sweeping Canisius in 

dominating fashion the previous 
weekend, 
the 
team 
entered 

Spring 
Break 
undefeated. 

However, 
Michigan 
dropped 

two out of its first three 
in 
California 
to 
unranked 

opponents to start the trip.

Expectations for the team are 

higher than ever, with numerous 
polls placing them as favorites 
in the Big Ten, but a couple of 
early-season losses didn’t faze 
the Wolverines.

“Going 1-2 on that weekend 

was a positive,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We wanted 
to see how we would respond to 
getting knocked down.”

Monday, 
sophomore 
left-

handed pitcher Oliver Jaskie 
set up the next set of games by 
shutting down No. 10 California. 
Jaskie gave up just three hits in 
5 and one-third innings pitched 
to boost the Wolverines to a 5-0 
upset victory.

But beyond Jaskie, the entire 

pitching staff has impressed 
early in the season. Bakich 
emphasized that every pitcher 
who has stepped in has done 
well so far, not just the marquee 
returners such as junior Brett 
Adcock 
and 
senior 
captain 

Evan Hill. 

Thirteen Michigan hurlers 

have seen action thus far, and 
they have combined to allow just 
17 earned runs in 10 games.

“Us as a staff have been 

really locked in on making good 
pitches when it counts,” said 
sophomore right-hander Ryan 
Nutof. “I think that’s been a key 
for the whole staff.”

Though the pitching has 

been solid, it was the lively 
bats in the lineup that carried 
the Wolverines to their next 
victory, as eight players notched 
hits in a 6-5 win against San 
Jose State. A joint effort from 
four Michigan relief pitchers, 
who didn’t allow a run past the 
fifth inning, halted a comeback 
effort by the Spartans.

Against 
UC 
Davis 
on 

Thursday, Nutof (2-1) took the 
mound hoping to win his third 
consecutive start. But Michigan 
committed two errors, which 
cost the Wolverines the lead 
and eventually the ballgame, 
losing, 4-3. 

The 
chance 
for 
revenge 

against UC Davis never came, 
as rainouts spoiled the games 
on Friday and Saturday. But 
a loss to end the week didn’t 
discourage 
Bakich 
and 
his 

team.

“Even though we had a few 

losses, I still feel like we’re 
getting better, because we had 
some teachable moments in 
those games,” Bakich said.

Bakich says that overall there 

were many positives to come out 
of the trip, both on and off the 
field. The rainouts and a built-
in off day allowed extra time for 
team bonding. 

The Wolverines spent the 

off day in San Francisco, where 
they took a boat across the bay 
to tour Alcatraz. At night, they 
watched the NBA’s Golden State 
Warriors pull out an overtime 
win against the Atlanta Hawks.

Despite the three losses, the 

team gained a lot of experience 
together on the road during the 
week, which will be key to its 
success throughout the season.

‘M’ loses on Senior Night

Wolverines’ NCAA 
Tournament hopes 
take hit with fourth 
loss in five games

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

On an already bittersweet 

night that saw the Michigan 
men’s basketball team honor its 
two injured 
stars, 
senior 
guards 
Spike Albrecht and Caris LeVert, 
the mood at Crisler Center — 
and 
the 
Wolverines’ 
NCAA 

tournament hopes — quickly 
took a turn for the worse.

Sitting squarely on the bubble 

with 20 wins and 10 conference 
wins, 
most 
bracketology 

experts 
labeled 
Michigan’s 

contest against No. 16 Iowa on 
Saturday as a “must-win” for its 
tournament résumé.

And though the Wolverines 

fought 
valiantly 
down 
the 

stretch — including a 10-0 
scoring run late in the second 
half while holding the Hawkeyes 
to a six-minute scoring drought 
— Iowa’s timely shooting and 
Michigan’s defensive struggles 
ultimately proved too much 
to overcome. The Wolverines 
dropped the game, 71-61, and 
now face the possibility of 
missing the NCAA Tournament 
for the second straight year.

Iowa forward Jarrod Uthoff, 

a national player of the year 
finalist, 
had 
his 
way 
with 

Michigan all night, peppering its 
defense with long-range jumpers 
and finishing with a game-high 
29 points. 

Junior forward Zak Irvin and 

junior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
combined for 25 as part of the 
Wolverines’ comeback effort — 
with Irvin scoring six straight 
points as part of Michigan’s late 

run — but Irvin also lost a costly 
turnover with 4:10 remaining, 
leading to a fast-break layup 
that snapped the Hawkeyes’ 
scoring drought.

Walton answered quickly with 

a jumper, but the Wolverines left 
guard Peter Jok wide open on 
the other end of the floor for a 
3-pointer and allowed Uthoff to 
convert an and-1 to suck the life 
out of the rally.

 “We have to be able to control 

that (run), and we did not,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “We 
took some bad shots. We just had a 
couple times where we needed to 
have more poise in that run. I get 
it — everyone was all jacked up 
and ready to go, but that’s not the 
way we need to respond.”

Much like the two teams’ 

first meeting back on Jan. 17, the 
game ended up as a classic battle 
of scoring runs. Iowa nearly ran 
away with the game early in 
the first half, with Michigan’s 
defense having no immediate 
answer. 
On 
one 
memorable 

play, Jok successfully carved a 
path through three Wolverine 
defenders for an easy layup, 
and Uthoff made his first three 
baskets of the game (including 
two 3-pointers) to help Iowa 
jump out to a 22-12 lead.

The Wolverines started the 

game 
shooting 
just 
2-for-11 

from three, but they battled 
back with an 11-2 run that began 
when Uthoff left the game for a 
few minutes midway through 
the half. Junior forward Mark 
Donnal ignited the run with a 
put-back hook shot and later 
knocked down a wide-open 
3-pointer in transition to get 
Michigan’s 
shooting 
going 

again. After a Walton 3-pointer 
and a fast-break layup from 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman, 
the 

Wolverines 
suddenly 
found 

themselves within one point, 
down 24-23 with fewer than 
seven minutes to go in the half.

The 
Hawkeyes, 
though, 

quickly recovered by turning to 
their strong outside shooters. 
Uthoff hit a 3-pointer to silence 
the run, and after Irvin missed 
back-to-back free throws with 
a chance to tie the game, Jok 
knocked down back-to-back 3s 
near the end of the half to push 
the lead back to six heading into 
the break. 

Iowa controlled the early 

second half as well before 
Michigan began its second major 
comeback attempt. But just like 
the first Wolverine run of the 
game — and just like the game 
two months ago in Iowa City — 
the Hawkeyes snuffed out the 
rally. Michigan never led after 
the first minute of play.

“Tip your hat to them, they’re 

a good team,” Walton said. 
“They got out in transition and 
did what they did. We answered 

as many times as possible, but I 
guess they had more bullets in 
the gun than we did tonight.”

The Wolverines now have their 

backs against the wall with regard 
to their tournament chances 
— in order to secure a bid, they 
may require two wins in next 
weekend’s Big Ten Tournament. 
Michigan is locked in as the No. 
8 seed, meaning it would have to 
win its first game and then topple 
conference champion Indiana to 
accomplish that feat.

“We’ll 
play 
good 
teams 

there, and we have another 
opportunity,” Beilein said. “I’ve 
always felt that we need to get 
more work done during this 
time. That way, any questions 
about us will be answered. ... 
Let’s see what we do in Indy 
and see what the (selection) 
committee thinks.”

Uthoff too much 
for Wolverines’ 
reeling defense

Iowa’s star forward 
scores 29 points on 
11-for-19 shooting 
to beat Michigan

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan basketball team 

just couldn’t stop Jarrod Uthoff. 
That 
wasn’t 
the 
Wolverines’ 

only problem in a game in which 
they tallied 11 turnovers, but 
after having junior forward Zak 
Irvin, redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan Robinson and sophomore 
forward Kameron Chatman try 
to defend the 6-foot-9 forward, 
it was apparent that no one on 
Michigan’s squad could deter him.

Uthoff scored 29 points in 

Iowa’s 71-61 victory, and in a 
way, the Wolverines (10-8 Big 
Ten, 20-11 overall) may have 
seen it coming.

While guards Caris LeVert 

and 
Spike 
Albrecht 
were 

honored prior to the Senior 
Night 
game, 

a 
different 

senior 
from 

Iowa 
(12-6, 

21-9) 
had 
a 

night of his 
own 
while 

the 
two 

Wolverines 
watched from 
the 
bench. 

Albrecht and 
LeVert would 
have been two of Michigan’s 
best 
defenders 
this 
season, 

but after their careers ended 
early, they watched a repetitive 
problem unfold in front of them 
throughout the season.

The Wolverines have trouble 

defending long players, and it 
was apparent all season long.

More recently, 7-footer Alex 

Olah dropped 19 points on 
Michigan on Feb. 24. Against 
Maryland on Jan. 17, 6-foot-
9 Robert Carter and 6-foot-11 
Diamond Stone scored 15 and 
22 
points, 
respectively. 
The 

Wolverines didn’t make much 
more of an improvement against 
the two taller Terrapins in 
the rematch on Feb. 21, either, 
allowing the two to combine for 
another 30 points.

Michigan, 
meanwhile, 

struggled to get its own big men 
going Saturday, combining for 11 
points. 

“We had trouble seeing the 

big man on the roll,” Beilein said. 
“We just had trouble. Zak saw 
him better than the other guys 
did. We didn’t get those looks 
that we’ve been getting that have 
better balance to our game.”

The 
Wolverines 
tried 
to 

compensate and attempted 34 
3-pointers, but they made just 
eight.

Though Michigan outscored 

the Hawkeyes in the paint, 
28-26, 
Iowa 
hit 
mid-range 

jumpers 
early 
and 
often, 

silencing the Michigan crowd as 
soon as it started to get loud.

Iowa coach Fran McCaffery 

knew that his senior would have 
a big night the day before in 
practice, saying that he finally 
looked like himself in practice 
after playing some down games. 

“I saw Jarrod Uthoff early,” 

Beilein said. “I mean, there are 
some things at his length and his 
size, I mean he hit the sleeper 3, I 
think he hit another (3-pointer), 
he hit a pull up. I mean, they’re 
good at running it.

“(Iowa) is just playing to win, 

and he played really loose.”

Added 
Robinson: 
“He’s 

talented, he’s very talented. He 
hit some tough shots, so credit 
to him. We gotta do a better 
job of staying locked into our 
assignments, just being more 
locked in as a team defensively.”

Though 
Michigan 
clawed 

back from a 15-point deficit in 
the second half with a 10-0 run 
that lasted six minutes, it ended 
with 4:10 left in the game when 
guard Mike Gesell stole the ball 
from Irvin for a fast-break layup. 

The steal was a fitting turning 

point in the Wolverines’ game. 
The Hawkeyes stole the ball seven 

different times 
and 
scored 

12 points off 
of 
turnovers. 

Following 
Gesell’s steal, 
Iowa 
pulled 

away 
once 

more, able to 
master 
both 

Michigan’s 
offense 
and 

defense.

“It’s a team that you really have 

to focus on stopping because of all 
the different action that they run 
at you,” McCaffery said. “John’s 
offense is well-known nationally. 
He has all kinds of counters and 
dribble-ats and blare screens and 
ball screens — ball screen again. 
I mean, you gotta really stay after 
it if you want to stop them.

“We didn’t give up any 

backdoors or really any easy 
layups.”

The Wolverines have become 

predictable in their losses, and 
in a game that was considered 
to be a must-win for their NCAA 
Tournament chances, they didn’t 
vary their formula enough to 
change the outcome.

WRESTLING
Wolverines take 
sixth in Big Ten

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
wrestling 

team walked into the Big Ten 
Championships in Iowa City on 
Saturday as the No. 8 team in the 
nation and as the fourth-ranked 
squad in the conference.

Thus, the Wolverines were 

disappointed when they found 
themselves in seventh place 
after the first day of wrestling. 
They recovered somewhat on 
Sunday to climb one spot in the 
final standings, finishing sixth.

“We hoped to have a better 

tournament, but we had some 
ups and downs,” said Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland. “There 
were a lot of tough matches, 
especially Saturday evening.”

Top-ranked 
junior 
Adam 

Coon 
headlined 
Michigan’s 

showing 
at 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championships. He advanced 
his way to the heavyweight 
finals 
with 
three 
straight 

victories. In one of them, Coon 
took a mere 38 seconds to pin 
Wisconsin’s Brock Horwath.

But Coon fell short of a Big Ten 

title as he lost, 7-4, to Ohio State’s 
second-ranked Kyle Snyder.

“(The final) was a hard-fought 

match, no question about it,” 
McFarland said. “But you just 
have to keep moving forward.”

In the 184-pound class, No. 

1 junior Domenic Abounader 
put up a strong showing of his 
own with a 9-1 major decision 
win against Wisconsin’s Ryan 
Christensen in the quarterfinals. 
He suffered a defeat at the hands 
of 
Nebraska’s 
fourth-ranked 

T.J. Dudley before rebounding 
for two more wins to take third 
place.

“Dom was the No. 1 seed, so 

he was a little disappointed,” 
McFarland 
said. 
“But 
he 

rebounded well.”

No. 6 junior Brian Murphy 

knocked 
off 
his 
first 
two 

opponents at 157 pounds, one 
of whom was Rutgers’ No. 3 
Richie Lewis. Murphy narrowly 
lost, 5-4, to Illinois’ No. 2 Isaiah 

Martinez, but notched a victory 
over Ohio State’s No. 4 Jake 
Ryan and Iowa’s Edwin Cooper 
Jr. to place third.

“I definitely took a step up 

in my last bouts this weekend,” 
Murphy said. “And I’m excited 
to build off of it for nationals.”

Sophomore 
Alec 
Pantaleo 

notched two victories in his 
first two bouts at 149 pounds, 
including 
a 
3-2 
win 
over 

Northwestern’s No. 4 Jason 
Tsirtsis.

He was then pinned by Penn 

State’s No. 1 Zain Retherford 
2:45 into the semifinal match. 
Pantaleo bounced back in the 
consolation rounds with two 
victories to take third place. One 
of them was an overtime win 
over Tsirtsis, who had beaten 
him earlier in the season.

“I 
didn’t 
like 
how 
my 

semifinal match went,” Pantaleo 
said. “It showed that there is a 
lot of work to be done. But it’s 
always nice to avenge a loss.”

Redshirt sophomore Conor 

Youtsey started off with a 9-1 
major decision victory over 
Northwestern’s Garrison White 
in the 125-pound class. But it 
was quickly followed by a 14-4 
loss at the hands of Iowa’s No. 2 
Tomas Gilman.

Youtsey 
still 
recovered, 

though, netting three more 
victories in the consolation 
rounds. It was strong enough for 
a fifth-place finish.

“I thought Youtsey had a 

strong tournament,” McFarland 
said. “He faced a lot of tough 
guys and had a lot of close 
matches. It was a whole new 
tournament, a whole new season 
for us.”

The Wolverines won’t have 

much time to dwell on the Big 
Ten Championships, though, as 
the NCAA Tournament begins 
March 17.

“If we find a way to bring 

it together for (the NCAA 
Tournament), I think we can 
surprise a lot of people,” Murphy 
said. “A lot of it is just getting 
into a good place mentally.”

SOFTBALL
Michigan goes 
5-0 in tourney

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 2 Michigan softball 

team was holding onto a tight 4-3 
lead in the bottom of the fourth 
inning against Oregon State when 
Tera Blanco stepped into the 
batter’s box.

The sophomore had started the 

day as the Wolverines’ pitcher, 
giving up three runs in the third 
inning, and taking over first base 
duties in the fourth.

She redeemed her rough outing 

on the mound with a pivotal at-bat, 
lacing a triple into right field past 
a diving outfielder to increase the 
lead to 6-3 — a lead her team would 
not relinquish on its way to a 9-3 
win over the Beavers.

“I had two strikes a lot in my 

at-bats today,” Blanco explained. 
“I was just thinking about getting 
a pitch near the zone and getting a 
piece of my bat on it.”

Blanco’s 
clutch 
hitting 

after 
re-entering 
the 
game 

as an infielder, though, was 
representative 
of 
Michigan’s 

weekend at the Judi Garman 
Classic in California.

The team (18-2) found a variety 

of ways to win en route to a 5-0 
record at the tournament.

The 
Wolverines 
displayed 

explosive and timely hitting. 
They pitched three shutouts. And 
they played dazzling defense.

“I thought we had a great 

week,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “We saw a lot. We’re 
getting better in all phases of the 
game. Being together for nine 
days is quite a growing experience 
just for us as a team. We showed 
we could be a very tough team, 
and I’m pleased with that.”

The 
tournament 
started 

Thursday when the Wolverines 
played No. 18 Missouri, their 
highest-ranked opponent of the 
weekend. The Tigers, though, 
were no match for the Wolverines’ 
combination of clustered hitting 
and dominant pitching on that 
first day.

As junior Megan Betsa hurled 

one of her best games of the 
season, tossing five innings of 
three-hit, shutout ball, Michigan 
put 
together 
two 
explosive 

innings of offense, scoring five 
runs in the second inning and 
seven in the fourth on its way to a 
13-0 run-rule victory.

Later that day, Blanco took the 

mound and went the distance 
against Long Beach State with a 
complete game shutout, while the 
offense scored five runs in both 
the second and seventh innings, 
giving Michigan an 11-0 win.

“I’m always getting better 

every single weekend and getting 
(more) confident in the circle,” 
Blanco said. “I have confidence in 
my team — it really helps with me 
being relaxed out there.”

A 24-0 run differential after 

two games had the Wolverines 
cruising, but Friday’s matchup 
against 
California 
posed 
a 

different challenge.

While Sara Driesenga pitched a 

gem of a game, tossing a three-hit, 
complete game shutout, the bats 
cooled off, forcing the Wolverines 
to grind out runs.

Two errors from the Golden 

Bears led to two Michigan runs 
in the first inning, before the 
Wolverines 
added 
insurance 

runs later in the game. The team 
tallied just six hits on the day, 
a departure from its first two 
games, but was able to make them 
count, emerging with a 4-0 win.

Later that day, the Wolverines 

found themselves in need of a 
comeback against North Carolina.

After scoring three runs in the 

fourth inning to command a 6-2 
lead, Michigan gave the lead right 
back. But it showed its trademark 
resilience in the fifth by scoring 
five runs to take back the lead 
once and for all, emerging with a 
hard-fought 11-6 victory.

“We didn’t pitch our best, but 

we had players step up to help 
us get the win,” Hutchins said of 
the North Carolina game. “That’s 
what resolve is — you’ve just 
gotta battle and not get caught 
up in the outcome.”
