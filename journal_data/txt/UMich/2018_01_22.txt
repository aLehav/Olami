On 
Friday 
afternoon, 

Chicago 
Mayor 
Rahm 

Emanuel 
spoke 
to 
a 
full 

house 
of 
University 
of 

Michigan 
students 
and 

community 
members 
at 

Stamps Auditorium. As part 
of the class Entrepreneurship 

407: 
Entrepreneurship 

Hour, 
Emanuel 
discussed 

entrepreneurship 
and 

innovation, 
drawing 
both 

on 
his 
past 
and 
present 

experience in politics.

Emanuel was elected as 

mayor in 2011, and before 
served in Congress and as 
Chief of Staff to President 
Barack Obama. He explained 
that during his time in the 

White House, there was never a 
shortage of crises, specifically 
within the financial sector 
and automotive industry. But 
he noted with each challenge 
came a new lesson in his role 
as a politician.

Pink pussy hats, bubbles and 

handmade 
signs 
flooded 
the 

University of Michigan Diag 
Saturday, signs that the Women’s 

March in Ann Arbor had returned 
for its second annual rally. 

The first march in Washington, 

D.C., occurring the day after 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

inauguration last year, protested 
Trump’s 
sexist 
rhetoric 
and 

policies. The theme of this year’s 
local march, according to vice 
chair of the Washtenaw County 

Board of Commissions Michelle 
Deatrick, who is also running 
for Michigan State Senate in Ann 
Arbor, is “power to the polls,” 
to encourage people to get and 
stay engaged as the November 
elections approach.

Approximately 4,000 students, 

faculty and community members 
assembled on the Diag for the 

rally. As one of hundreds of 
women’s 
marches 
occurring 

nationwide, this year’s gathering 
included 
voter 
registration 

and poster-making tables, as 
well as outreach stations from 
organizations.

LSA 
sophomore 
Amanda 

Wasserman 
was 
nearly 
in 

tears as she hit the submit 
button. 
A 
stressful 
and 

overwhelming 
process 
had 

led up to this moment — 
she had just submitted her 
application 
to 
pursue 
an 

undergraduate degree in the 
School of Public Health. After 
taking a public health class 
and learning about various 
health 
crises, 
Wasserman 

dismissed thoughts of going 
into medicine and instead was 
sold on the broader impact of 
public health. But not everyone 
is accepted into the program.

Wasserman is one of many 

University 
of 
Michigan 

students 
applying 
into 
a 

major or program for their 
upper 
level 
coursework. 

Students must apply to get into 
undergraduate 
programs 
in 

more than nine schools at the 
University.

Larry Nassar, the former doctor 

for US Gymnastics and Michigan 
State University, is the defendant 
in three criminal cases –– two 
in state courts and one in federal 
court –– for possession of child 
pornography and sexual abuse 
of over one hundred athletes 
whose medical treatment he was 
responsible for. Nassar received 
a degree in kinesiology from the 
University of Michigan in 1985, 
and worked with the University’s 
football and track and field teams 
while he was a student. The dates 
of the assaults span decades, with 
the earliest occurring in 1992, 
when Nassar was still a medical 
student at MSU, and the latest 
occurring in 2016.

Several of the lawsuits against 

Nassar also include MSU as a 
defendant. MSU employees were 
notified of Nassar’s abuse as 
early as 1999, but largely either 

dismissed or suppressed the 
complaints. MSU President Lou 
Anna Simon was notified of a Title 
IX complaint and a police report 
against Nassar in 2014, which she 
said were reported to her as being 
“against an unnamed physician.”

Ingham County criminal case
One of the cases, a criminal 

case in Ingham County, has 
drawn widespread attention with 
120 women and girls accusing him 
of sexual assault, many of whom 
are Olympic gold medalists.

Nassar has pleaded guilty to 7 

counts of sexual assault, though 
over one hundred girls have been 
able to speak on their experiences 
of assault.

Though not a part of the 

Ingham County case, Olympic 
gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla 
Maroney and Jamie Dantzscher 
also spoke on their abuse by 
Nassar.

The sentencing hearing began 

Jan. 16 and will last at least 5 days. 
Judge Rosemarie Aquilina set 
aside time for survivors to share 
statements in front of Nassar.

Twenty-one more survivors 

rose to stand in the Ingham 
County courthouse to share 
their experience of sexual 
abuse at the hands of former 
Michigan 
State 
University 

doctor Larry Nassar on Friday.

Nearly every seat in the 

courtroom 
was 
filled 
by 

survivors and their families, 
and at the conclusion of each 
impact statement the room 
erupted in applause.

Nassar, the former doctor for 

USA Gymnastics and MSU, has 
pled guilty to seven counts of 
first degree sexual misconduct 
in Ingham County and three 
counts 
in 
Eaton 
county, 

including sexual assault and 
abuse of girls as young as six 
years old.

Survivors testifying Friday 

morning recounted years of 
abuse along with the life-long 
mental and physical suffering 
which followed.

Trenea Gonzcar identified 

herself as one of “the originals” 
who has known Nassar for 31 of 
37 years and stood by his side 
through most of it.

“I remember thinking that if 

no one could fix me, you could,” 
Gonzcar said.

It was not until recently 

Gonzcar identified herself as 
a survivor. Calculating the 
amount of times she saw Nassar 
for “treatment” through her 
life, she estimates she was 
assaulted nearly 800 times.

During 
her 
statement, 

Nassar broke down shaking 
in tears as Gonzcar told him 
she was done defending him, 
choosing to stand alongside the 
other survivors.

Reading in a moving car can 

be an issue for a lot of passengers 
who suffer from motion sickness, 
but 
University 
of 
Michigan 

researchers announced Friday 
they may have a solution. Not 
only are the researchers looking 

for innovations to help with 
motion sickness itself, but they 
are looking at how these systems 
can be useful in self-driving cars.

According to the Michigan 

Medicine, motion sickness occurs 
when the body sends conflicting 
signals to the brain, which often 
happens when a passenger is not 
watching the road when inside 
a moving vehicle. Researchers 
predict that more adults will 

experience motion sickness in 
self-driving cars.

In 2015, researchers from 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Transportation 
Research 

Institute asked approximately 
3,200 adults from six countries 
what activities they would do in a 
self-driving car. The study found 
a third of Americans would 
partake in behavior –– reading, 
watching TV, working –– that 

would increase the possibility of 
motion sickness.

In a 2016 UMTRI report, 

researchers asserted potential 
gains in productivity that self-
driving cars encourage could be 
hindered by increased cases of 
motion sickness.

Rackham students organize 
conference, “The Other America”

A multi-panel event, titled 

“The 
Other 
America: 
Still 

Separate. Still Unequal.,” was held 
Friday at the Michigan Union 
to highlight continuing racial 
injustices from economic, social 
and political standpoints, while 
commemorating Martin Luther 

King Jr.’s legacy. The conference 
presented three panels throughout 
the day on discrimination African 
Americans face in today’s society.

The conference was organized 

by Rackham students Hakeem 

J. 
Jefferson 
and 
Steven 

Moore. Each panel examined 
a different realm of racial 
injustice 
and 
inequality, 

ranging 
from 
mass 

incarceration 
and 
police 

violence to socioeconomic and 
educational inequalities. This 
event followed Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day celebrations on 
Jan. 15, and gave the audience a 
deeper insight into the realities 
African American life in the 
U.S in a way that indicated 
much of the fight against 
racism is far from over.

The conference’s first panel, 

“Criminal Justice and State 
Violence against Blacks in the 
United States,” was held in the 
morning and featured three 
panelists from distinguished 
universities and backgrounds. 
The 
discussion, 
moderated 

by Political Science professor 
Christian Davenport, focused 
on the history of the African-
American 
struggle 
within 

the United States, as well as 
the continued discrimination 
faced by African Americans 
today.

Megan 
Ming 
Francis, 

associate professor of Political 
Science at the University of 
Washington, spoke to the audience 
on “The Strange Fruit of American 
Politics,” which included allusions 
to both past and current racial 
issues, such as the August incidents 
in Charlottesville. Additionally, 
Francis stressed top universities 
don’t typically host events with 
such 
directness 
surrounding 

racial injustice, emphasizing the 
importance of the conference.

“These types of conferences 

don’t happen at institutions,” 
Francis said. “In so many ways, 
I think this conference is history 
making.”

The 
panel 
also 
featured 

Frank Baumgartner, professor of 
Political Science at the University 
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 
Baumgartner touched on issues 
of criminal justice and the gap 
between 
Blacks 
and 
whites 

being questioned or searched at 
a traffic stop. In his presentation, 
Baumgartner cited the greater 
likelihood of being searched as 
an African American and the 
consequences of racial profiling on 
the roads. Baumgartner also noted 
age and gender, in addition to race, 
play a role in the probability of 
being pulled over.

“No role models and I’m here 

right now

No role models to speak of
Searchin’ 
through 
my 

memory, my memory, I couldn’t 
find one” – J. Cole

Think of the first person 

you’ve ever admired. Perhaps 
you thought of someone in your 
neighborhood growing up or a 
family friend.

Maybe you struggled with 

finding 
someone 
nearby. 

Role models do not have to 
be limited to older members 
living in your community. For 
many, to fill the void of suitable 
role models, there are always 
figures in culture to hold in 
high regard. Even growing 
up in a community where you 
feel like the outsider, at least 
there is always someone to 

relate with through another 
medium, the messages society 
and media feed to you as the 
ideal to aim to be. Think of the 
poise and confidence of Tom 
Brady evading defenders left 
and right in the passing pocket. 
The furrow in his eyebrows 
while being brought down by 
a defensive lineman, eyes still 
locked downfield to see if his 
receiver made the catch, crowd 
roaring. Or maybe it’s the 
character in the sitcom who 
is slightly awkward but still 
becomes the mediator at the 
right times and shines during 
their moment.

Growing up can be hard, 

and part of that process of 
discovering 
yourself 
and 

finding 
your 
uniqueness 

inevitably involves having role 
models: individuals who you 
can look up to for assurance 
that going down your current 
path will be able to lead 

to a desired outcome. For 
individuals with the privilege 
of having someone who looks 
like them represent them on 
media, they are able to validate 
their every nook and cranny 
of their personality. For every 
quirk in character or behavior, 
human beings want to know 
they are normal. And for most 
people, there is that somebody, 
whether it be in the community 
or in media, who normalizes 
your behavior or personality 
and who acknowledges and 
represents your full humanity, 
full of nuance and complexity. 

For most of my life, I had no 

conception of what it meant to 
be a Korean-American man, to 
be able to envision myself in 20 
years. The best representation 
was always my dad. Stern and 
stoic, his only interests were 
to make sure my sisters and 
I enjoyed prosperous lives in 
the future. His perceived one-

dimensionality, 
a 
common 

stereotype of Asian parents, 
carried into the one-on-one 
conversations we had in car 
rides. (It would only be years 
later when I first initiated 
a conversation with my dad 
about my struggles when he 
shared his own hardships.) 
Feelings were never discussed. 
Instead, 
food 
was 
on 
the 

table, and I was put in varying 
extracurriculars to fill the time 
not in school. It was assumed 
that I would end up becoming 
successful somehow, always 
biding my time for a mythical 
future. What I didn’t have was 
any fathom of was what to do 
with the time in between.

Looking for myself among 

the sea of faces on television, 
there was no one. Instead, 
the few times that do pop into 
mind 
were 
always 
varying 

permutations 
of 
the 
same 

stereotype of the nerd or the 
martial artist. Was it okay to 
be introverted but still possess 
a deep personality? Could I 
be interested in humanities 
but still pursue a career in the 
STEM field? It felt as though 
every time I deviated from my 
parents’ wishes, I was pushing 
the envelope in what society 
and the messages I grew up 
with expected of me, when it 
shouldn’t be that way. There is 
an undeniable connection that 
comes from seeing someone 
like you on television that 
can’t be mimicked no matter if 
there was a person of another 
background playing out your 
life’s key events.

Representation also extends 

beyond just having role models. 
Representation also involves 
other 
deeper 
underlying 

issues. From corporations in 
America to the locker rooms, 
voting booths and Hollywood, 
Asian Americans are not being 
represented. This past year 
included both highs as well as 
lows in progress for increasing 

diversity 
in 
Hollywood. 

Though there may have been 
a slight mishap during the 
Oscars, “Moonlight,” a movie 
portraying 
a 
gay 
African-

American 
teenager 
growing 

up in Miami won Best Picture. 
It’s a full-length movie that is 
able to portray the protagonist 
Chiron’s 
myriad 
of 
social 

identities as well as his daily 
struggles. 
The 
movie 
does 

a masterful job of depicting 
Chiron’s transition from boy 
to man, trying to figure out life 
like the rest of the audience. 
However, a low point last year 
was Matt Damon being casted 
as the lead for “The Great Wall,” 
a movie set in China where he 
“discovers” the secrets behind 
the Great Wall and plays savior.

I know many people who 

ask, “What’s the big problem? 
Why does it matter who gets 
the lead role in a movie?” 
But when you’ve never come 
into contact with someone of 
another race in your entire 
life, the only image of a person 
that comes to mind are ones 
that are already saturated in 
culture. Unconscious bias plays 
a huge role, and media shapes 
it. This is a well-documented 
psychological 
phenomenon 

called implicit bias. 

Perhaps it doesn’t matter as 

much in casual social settings, 
but what about in the rooms of 
corporations while choosing 
new 
potential 
candidates? 

Think of a scenario when it 
comes down to two people, one 
with a more “exotic” sounding 
name and one with a generic 
English name, but with the 
exact same specifications. In a 
study from Ryerson University 
and University of Toronto, job 
applicants with more Asian 
sounding names such as “Soyou 
Han” were 20 percent less likely 
to get called for an interview 
than Anglo names like “John 
Smith.” As the person hiring, 
you can only think of the 

numerous shows you’ve seen 
with the immigrant speaking 
broken English, meek and shy, 
unable to be seen as a leader. In 
a 2015 study of Silicon Valley, 
Asian-Americans represented 
27 percent of workers but only 
14 percent of executives at 
the surveyed big tech firms. 
Perhaps for the company it was 
only a decision, but for me the 
message I got was simple: Asian 
Americans aren’t leaders. Who 
would you hire them?

Representation matters. I’ll 

say it again. Representation 
matters. It is not just Asian 
Americans. There are other 
groups in this country who 
also 
do 
not 
have 
proper 

representation, 
such 
as 

those 
with 
disabilities. 

Representation 
that 
means 

being cast in those lead roles 
and being in front of the 
spotlight, but not in a way that 
relegates my heritage to the 
level of food on a sampler plate, 
only thought of as extra and 
as an appetizer for the main 
course. Representation in all 
its entirety and nuance, and all 
with individuals one can aspire 
to become.

At the end of the day, human 

beings want few things. As 
social creatures, we desire 
friends and acceptance. For 
many individuals, there are 
ways to validate themselves 
through media. Nerdy band 
geek? You got it. Jock with 
a passion for art? You got it. 
However, 
there 
are 
people 

who do not have this same 
opportunity to feel empowered. 
Be that role model for another 
person. Show them that life 
does not have to be defined 
in neat little categories. Your 
quirks and character “flaws” 
can be your greatest assets. 
Maybe I would have still gone 
down my current path in life 
without any representation or 
role models, but damn, would it 
have been easier.

No Role Models

YOUNG LEE
MiC Columnist

On 
the 
anniversary 
of 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

inauguration, 
congressional 

Democrats 
and 
Republicans 

failed to agree on a budget 
that would secure continued 
protection for the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program and 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals.

As of now, this has resulted 

in political gridlock: While 
Republicans 
have 
pushed 

for 
CHIP, 
the 
Trump 

administration seems to be 
against protecting DACA. On 
the other hand, Democrats 
have been fighting to continue 
funding and support for both. 
While an argument can be made 
that this government shutdown 
is a direct result of the fight to 
protect CHIP and DACA — two 
programs that benefit people 
of color — it is important to 
understand the impact this 
fight will have on marginalized 
communities.

Lack of action on CHIP and 

DACA

More specifically, CHIP helps 

children across the country 
live healthier lives by granting 
children 
from 
low-income 

families access to medical care. 
Unfortunately, this program’s 
funding expired this past year, 
and no agreement has been met 
on supplying its future funding. 
Though CHIP only represents 
3 percent of our total Medicaid 
costs, Republican opposition 
to the program may condemn 
low-income children across the 
United States to being raised 
without access to necessary 
vaccines 
and 
other 
health 

coverages. Up to 1.7 million 
kids may lose their healthcare 
in the upcoming weeks. In 2017, 
around 67 percent of CHIP 
recipients identified as people 
of color, which is why the loss 

of this program would result in 
severe ramifications for these 
communities. 

DACA, on the other hand, 

is a provision from President 
Barack Obama’s administration 
that 
guarantees 
two 
years 

of safety for undocumented 
individuals 
who 
arrived 
in 

the United States as minors, 
as long as they are registered 
with the federal government. 
Today, there are approximately 
800,000 registered Dreamers 
who have been promised they 
could stay in the country. 
However, 
the 
current 

administration 
has 
issued 

threat 
after 
threat 
against 

undocumented 
individuals. 

This 
means 
that 
Dreamers 

— our friends, neighbors and 
classmates — who took a huge 
risk by sending their personal 
information 
to 
the 
federal 

government in order to register 
for DACA may now see this 
information be used against 
them.

Even 
on 
campus, 
DACA 

has sparked a larger dialogue 
about 
what 
students, 
staff 

and faculty can do to protect 
undocumented 
students. 

Earlier in Trump’s presidency, 
Central Student Government 
even passed two resolutions 
supporting DACA. Later, after 
the president tried to pass 
his travel ban, University of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel stated the University 
is committed to protecting 
the rights of all community 
members and will not release 
the immigration status of any 
students. 
Additionally, 
he 

assured students that campus 
police would not ask them about 
immigration 
or 
citizenship 

status 
while 
working 
on 

campus.

“The 
leadership 
of 
the 

university 
is 
committed 
to 

protecting 
the 
rights 
and 

opportunities 
currently 

available to all members of 

our 
academic 
community, 

and to do whatever is possible 
within the law to continue to 
identify, recruit, support and 
retain academic talent, at all 
levels, from around the world,” 
Schlissel wrote in his Jan. 28 
notice. 

The Trump administration’s 

visible disdain for people of 
color has been the cornerstone 
of 
the 
president’s 
policies 

since 
the 
beginning 
of 

his 
campaign. 
With 
this 

government shutdown, which 
we, the editors of Michigan 
in Color, feel is a testament to 
the lack of value the current 
administration 
places 
on 

undocumented individuals, his 
racist ideas and rhetoric are 
resulting in widespread failures 
of government that will cut off 
resources for many Americans. 
And perhaps unsurprisingly, 
people of color will be forced to 
bear a disproportionate amount 
of the burden.

Effects of the shutdown
Perhaps the most apparent 

consequence of a government 
shutdown 
is 
its 
effect 
on 

payment for federal employees. 
Those deemed “unessential” 
— roughly 700,000employees, 
the vast majority of all federal 
government workers — are 
now placed on furlough until 
Congress can reach a deal. This 
means that while Congress gets 
paid during the gridlock they 
created, over three-quarters 
of a million federal employees 
will not see a paycheck until a 
deal is reached (assuming that 
Congress passes a deal similar 
to one passed after the last 
shutdown, which granted back 
pay to furloughed employees). 
This pay freeze may seem 
relatively innocuous in the 
bigger picture; however, it’s 
crucial to understand the effect 
this will have on individual 
federal employees — especially 
those 
from 
marginalized 

groups.

Starting 
after 
the 
Civil 

Rights Movement of the 1960s, 
African 
Americans 
began 

flocking to federal jobs with 
newly-available positions for 
Black applicants. While jobs 
in the private sector were (and 
still are) limited by racist and 
exclusionary policies, federal 
jobs were largely seen as open to 
all racial identities and agents 
of upward mobility. According 
to a study from the University of 
California, Berkeley, which was 
reported on by NPR, “among 
industries that pay blacks the 
highest 
wages, 
the 
biggest 

proportion 
of 
those 
blacks 

work in the public sector.” The 
article went on to state that 
the report found “the earnings 
gap between whites and blacks, 
which exists in all industries, is 
the narrowest in government…
[and] for every dollar earned 
by white government workers, 
black women in government 
earn 89 cents and black men 
earn 80 cents. Overall, black 
women earn 85 cents and black 
men earn 74 cents for every 
dollar earned by whites.”

As 
a 
result 
of 
this 

history, 
Blacks 
are 
vastly 

overrepresented 
in 
federal 

government 
roles. 
Despite 

making 
up 
only 
about 
13 

percent 
of 
the 
country’s 

population, African Americans 
occupy almost 20 percent of 
all federal jobs. As a result, 
it’s easy to see why this 
shutdown 
disproportionately 

affects 
the 
group. 
This 

inequitable 
distribution 

isn’t a crazy coincidence or 
an inconsequential fact, it’s 
representative 
of 
a 
bigger 

problem: People of color, and 
members of other marginalized 
identities, all too often must 
unfairly bear the burden of 
government gridlock.

Additionally, 
the 
impact 

of halting the services these 
federal employees offer will 
harm 
some 
groups 
more 

than others. For example, 96 
percent of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) will be 
furloughed as a result of the 
government shutdown. HUD 
was created to address housing 
needs 
for 
“America’s 
most 

vulnerable 
populations” 
— 

which the department defines 
as the working poor, minorities, 
Native Americans, people with 
disabilities, people with AIDS, 
the elderly and the homeless. In 
other words, the majority of the 
groups described as “America’s 
most vulnerable populations” 
are 
minority 
groups 
(and 

even 
groups 
that 
aren’t 

exclusively made up of people 
of color, like the homeless, see 
a disproportionate share of 
minorities).

Services 
provided 
by 

other 
government 
agencies, 

such as the Environmental 
Protection Agency, will also be 
drastically reduced. According 
to 
Parlapiano 
and 
Yourish, 

95 percent of employees at 
the EPA would be affected 
by a government shutdown, 
meaning many of the EPA’s 
services will be halted. Though 
this agency has a contingency 
plan that will allow it to 
operate for one week through a 
shutdown, if Congress is unable 
to bring this gridlock to a swift 
conclusion, crucial services — 
such as the regulation of air, 
water, pesticides, hazardous 
waste and the climate — will 
be delayed. The suspension 
of these services are more 
likely to impact people of color 
in a multitude of ways. For 
example, the regulation of air 
is imperative in safeguarding 
the health of people living 
near factories and other smog-
producing 
industries, 
urban 

areas populated primarily by 
people of color.

The final victims of the 

shutdown 
are 
children 
of 

color. According to a White 
House report from the 2013 

fiscal year, over 6,300 low-
income 
kids 
in 
six 
states 

couldn’t 
attend 
their 
Head 

Start programs in preschool 
during the shutdown, leaving 
them in need of a place to stay 
while parents were at work. 
The majority of the children 
who comprise these Head Start 
programs are ethnic minorities 
— 29 percent Black, 4 percent 
American 
Indian/Native 

American, 2 percent Asian, 
and 37 percent of Hispanic or 
Latino origin, according to a 
2016 national report. Similarly, 
Women, Infants, and Children, 
a program that works to fund 
supplemental 
nutrition 
for 

women and their children has 
also been compromised. This 
program not only gives support 
for 
low-income 
families 

through educational programs, 
but also supplies postpartum 
and 
breastfeeding 
women 

with supplemental foods and 
vitamins for their newborns. 
This not only creates issues for 
many of the families that may 
already live in food deserts, 
but 
also 
for 
women 
who 

desperately need nutritional 
foods to nourish their child 
within the vital time period of 
the first 28 days to one year of 
breastfeeding.

In short, the government 

shutdown 
disproportionately 

puts 
a 
further 
burden 
on 

marginalized 
communities. 

While we firmly believe that 
CHIP and DACA are important 
policies that should stay, people 
of color should not be the 
ones to bear the weight of this 
government impasse. What we 
see with this shutdown down 
is the further exacerbation 
of systemic inequality that 
negatively affects the income, 
occupations, living conditions 
and the health of people of color. 
Ultimately, this shutdown sends 
a message from the Trump 
administration that the needs 
of marginalized communities

O

ver the past few years, 
I have seen my older 
brother, a mentor of 

mine, become increasingly 
involved in social justice and 
civil rights issues. Two weeks 
ago, he began his professional 
career 
as 
a 
paralegal, 

working on death penalty 
defense cases on behalf of 
the state. This line of work 
is notoriously both difficult 
and emotionally draining. In 
his words, it is a fight against 
a system where the defense 
is 
routinely 
given 
fewer 

resources and tools than the 
prosecution and asked to do 
the same work.

Being the arrogant business 

student I am, I recently asked 
him why he wants to devote 
his life to a field where he will 
continue to fight a frustrating 
uphill battle, all the while 
being compensated less than 
he might be in another field. 
According to him, he could 
not, in good conscience, live 
in a state that was routinely 
and 
unjustly 
mistreating 

its 
own 
citizens 
without 

doing something about it. In 
his opinion, those that are 
bystanders just contribute to 
the issue itself.

His response took me by 

surprise, and in all honesty, 
I 
felt 
almost 
personally 

attacked by his answer. I 
try to subscribe to a life 
philosophy best characterized 
by the Elbert Hubbard quote, 
“Don’t take life too seriously. 
You’ll never get out of it alive.” 
By my brother’s standards 
though, acknowledging that 
problems exist in the world, 
and 
willfully 
choosing 
to 

ignore them on behalf of my 
own happiness does, in fact, 
add to the problem itself. 
While I initially tried to 
ignore 
that 
disconcerting 

thought, returning back to my 
world here at the University 
of Michigan, I couldn’t help 
but check my own reality, 
and think about all of the 
small, willfully complacent 
behaviors that exist in my 
daily routine.

Not a week goes by that 

I don’t find myself walking 
through the Diag on the way to 
class or downtown Ann Arbor, 
passing individuals protesting 
for causes I wholeheartedly 
agree with, yet rarely stopping 
to participate. I take Ubers 
and Lyfts around Ann Arbor 
when the weather drops below 
freezing in the winter, and 
though I have been told that 
one of these entities treats its 
employees better and provides 
them with a larger portion of 
the fare than its counterpart, I 
choose the service that is least 
expensive every time.

As 
my 
mental 
register 

of 
complacent 
activities 

continued to grow, I began 
to 
consider 
the 
larger 

implications of this lifestyle. 
Was 
this 
philosophy 
of 

choosing 
to 
engage 
in 

behaviors that were most 
comfortable and convenient 
for me selfish, or was I 
entitled to be unconcerned 
with issues that did not 
directly involve me?

I’ve spent the past few 

days 
working 
on 
this 

column, contemplating these 
questions and attempting to 
rationalize the belief that I 
was not responsible for the 
world’s 
problems. 
Those 

efforts have proven futile. If I 
walk past graffiti filled with 
racial slurs here on campus 
and choose to stay silent, I 
am in effect validating the 
behavior of the assailants. If I 
see a friend, or even stranger, 
being harassed at a party, and 
walk by when they are in need 
of help, I am part of whatever 

may happen next.

At the same time, there are 

an infinite number of wrongs 
in the world that could very 
well justify our attention and 
action, and perhaps it is just as 
unreasonable to have a stake 
in every fight. Should I refuse 
to buy a Chick-fil-A sandwich 
because 
the 
company 
has 

donated 
to 
anti-LGBTQ 

causes? If I take a stand against 
this food retailer, then do I also 
have to take a stand against 
McDonald’s, who sources some 
meat from firms known for 
inhumane animal practices? 
Should 
I 
refuse 
to 
buy 

diamonds because I am unsure 
they originate from ethical 
sourcing? Interestingly, I still 
see 
student 
organizations 

selling Chick-fil-A sandwiches 
on campus to raise money for 
their 
philanthropic 
causes 

(pretty ironic, huh?), long lines 
at the airport as people wait to 
satiate their hunger with some 
McNuggets and young nervous 
men buying engagement rings 
in preparation to pop the big 
question.

In every one of these cases, 

we are in fact contributing 
to harmful institutions, and 
our action (or inaction) could 
be making the world a better 
(or worse off) place. But it is 
unrealistic, and harmful to 
our personal wellbeing, to try 
to take a stake in every fight. 
It is important to acknowledge 
that every decision we make 
has 
consequences 
and 
to 

prioritize where we can and 
should take action. I am 
still figuring out where this 
balance exists for myself, and 
depending on your personal 
moral compass, everyone has 
their own unique balance. But 
if you can just try to be a little 
better every day, constantly 
improving yourself and the 
world around you, then you 
should not feel guilty for being 
selfish from time to time. Just 
make it up tomorrow.

What duty do I owe to the world?

A

t its basic level, the 
role of our American 
government is to serve 

as the voice of the people. 
They fundraise from 
the American people 
through taxation, and 
use those funds in the 
best interest of the 
country. Despite the 
last year’s whirlwind 
of political news, the 
essential 
functions 

of government have 
remained working to 
serve the American 
people 
throughout 

all 
of 
the 
turmoil 

in 
Washington, 
D.C.. 

Last 
Friday’s 
government 

shutdown was a failure of 
that critical responsibility, 
and Congressional Democrats 
are largely to blame.

Congressional 
Democrats 

bemoaned the 2013 suspension 
of federal services, and their 
cries now ring hypocritically 
hollow against their actions in 
leading the U.S. Government 
to a crisis point. In 2013, 
Republicans, 
led 
by 
Sen. 

Ted 
Cruz, 
R-Texas, 
halted 

government 
operations 
for 

16 days in an attempt to pull 
funding for the unpopular — at 
the time — Affordable Care Act. 
In sacrificing the moral high 
ground, Republicans cemented 
the ACA’s place in public policy 
— and public opinion.

Now, 
Congressional 

Democrats have taken the 
same shameful stance, and 
have driven the fight over 
the 
budget 
off 
the 
edge 

of a dangerous cliff. In a 
Thursday 
morning 
tweet, 

President 
Donald 
Trump 

seemed to confuse his stance 
on the issue of the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program 
— which finds its funding 
up for renewal during this 
budget fight — and demanded 
that Congress find a lasting 
solution. Republicans, who 
proposed 
a 
short-term 

extension 
of 
CHIP, 
can’t 

agree with Democrats, who 
want a permanent funding 
solution for CHIP. By shutting 
down 
the 
government, 

Democrats run the risk of 
having CHIP funding follow 
in the footsteps of the ACA 
opposition. 
In 
that 
case, 

1.7 million children in 20 
states and D.C., will lose 
their health insurance. The 
elevation of CHIP funding to 
a political level now risks the 
permanent defunding of the 
program, while failing the 
most underserved children 

in our country in hopes of 
scoring political points.

The 
consequences 
of 

this 
shutdown 
can’t 
yet 

be 
quantified. 

Thousands 
of 
federal 

workers 
will 

be 
furloughed 

starting 
today, 

and some of the 
nation’s 
critical 

infrastructure 
and services are 
now 
shut 
off. 

Standard & Poor’s 
estimate that the 
2013 government 

shutdown 
cost 
the 
U.S. 

economy $24 billion. This is 
a cost that nobody — even the 
most outspoken Democrat on 
Capitol Hill — wants for the 
American economy. Shutting 
down 
the 
government 
is 

almost 
certain 
to 
usher 

in a period of unfiltered 
chaos 
for 
public 
sector 

workers and the millions of 
Americans who rely on the 
federal government for their 
economic well-being.

Aside from the financial 

ramifications, the political 
ramifications 
of 
partially 

closing 
the 
nation’s 

government are even higher. 
The shutdown in 1995 led 
to massive public disdain 
for Republicans, and 2013’s 
shutdown 
ushered 
in 
the 

lowest approval rating of 
the 
Republican 
party 
in 

20 
years. 
Democrats 
are 

currently riding a massive 
wave 
of 
positive 
public 

opinion — brought on by 
the 
unpopularity 
of 
the 

Trump administration and 
Congressional 
Republicans’ 

inability to make actionable 
progress 
on 
electorally-

mandated policy proposals. 
Flushing 
that 
positive 

public 
opinion 
down 
the 

drain to prove a point to 
Republican leadership isn’t 
just a bad political move — 
it’s a failure of their most 

basic responsibilities as our 
elected officials.

Even more shameful than 

the Democrats’ inaction on 
the budget is their insistence 
on using the Deferred Action 
for 
Childhood 
Arrivals 

program as a hostage in 
their negotiations to keep 
the government open. This 
program, 
which 
prevents 

the deportation of certain 
undocumented 
immigrants 

who 
were 
brought 
by 

parents to the United States 
as minors, is a policy that 
affects 
800,000 
young 

people. A judge in California 
already temporarily blocked 
implementation of the DACA 
repeal, and young immigrants 
deserve better than to have 
their lives used as a bargaining 
chip by people claiming to 
protect 
them. 
A 
solution 

to 
DACA 
exists 
without 

funding the border wall — as 
President Trump insists — 
and without shutting down 
the government. Gambling 
the fate of young immigrants, 
including many of our fellow 
University 
of 
Michigan 

classmates, on Republicans’ 
willingness to do the right 
thing is never a safe bet, and 
is a bet that will likely harm 
everyone involved.

The way forward for the 

progressive 
policies 
that 

America desperately needs 
is 
through 
the 
retention 

of 
public 
opinion 
behind 

the 
Democrats. 
These 

policies also have no chance 
of 
implementation 
if 
the 

government 
isn’t 
running. 

Democrats’ best plan isn’t 
to stoop to the level of 
Ted Cruz in 2013 or Newt 
Gingrich in 1995, but rather 
to do their constitutionally-
mandated duty to fund the 
federal 
government, 
while 

working with Congressional 
Republicans to ensure that 
people 
protected 
under 

DACA will be able to remain 
in the United States and that 
the CHIP program can be 
funded in the long-run. The 
American 
people 
deserve 

better than a government 
shutdown, 
and 
Children’s 

Health Care coverage and 
the fate of DACA recipients 
should never be used as a 
bargaining chip in a political 
fight.

Animal 
Collective 
recently 
played their 2004 album Sung 
Tongs in full for Pitchfork’s 21st 
birthday. As I watched a bootleg 
of the performance, I found myself 
falling back in time, a slave to the 
wanderings of my mind and its 
melancholic musings.
“Sweet summer night, and I’m 
stripped to my sheets / Forehead is 
leaking, my AC squeaks / A voice 
from the clock says ‘You’re not 
gonna get tired’ / My bed is a pool 
and the walls are on fire”
I’m barely conscious, drifting 
in and out of sleep in the back of 
my family’s 2001 Honda Odyssey. 
We’re driving down to South 
Carolina for spring break, and the 
van’s air conditioning is shot. Ten 
more hours until we reach Folly 
Beach — population 2,600 — the 
quiet, seaside tourist destination 
my parents have selected for the 
final vacation before my high 
school graduation. Later this week, 
Sufjan Stevens will release Carrie 
and Lowell, and I will become 
obsessed. As listening for the 
ride down, though, I’ve asked my 
girlfriend what albums I should 
download. She recommends five or 
six, but the only one I remember is 
Animal Collective’s Merriweather 
Post Pavilion (2009).
One listen through and I 
was confused. After a few more 
admittedly 
drowsy 
attempts, 
I still couldn’t understand the 
appeal. The songs took too long to 
get anywhere. They were boring 
and had an oddly dark quality; 
Sometimes I still describe Animal 
Collective’s music as sounding 
evil. Nonetheless, I felt like I had 
to choose at least one song to say 
that I really liked. I settled on 
“Guys Eyes,” a tune with plenty 
of pleasant layers and harmonies 
that could only be inspired by the 
Beach Boys. Just under a year ago, I 
actually looked up the lyrics to the 
song, leaving me without a doubt 
that it is purely and proudly a song 
about masturbation. “So I used my 
mind / And I used my hand / It was 
what I want to do,” Noah Lennox 

(aka Panda Bear) slyly croons, 
allowing the more naïve listener 
plausible deniability. 
“I really want to show my girl 
that I want her / If I could purge all 
the urges that I have and keep them 
for you / I really want to show my 
girl that I need her / I keep it locked 
right now”
Around the same time, senior 
year of high school, I started 
reading Pitchfork. I didn’t know all 
that much about music — not that 
one has to or even should in order 
to enjoy it — and my favorite artists 
were Rise Against, Avicii and The 
Head and the Heart. I had joined 
Spotify late in 2012, the beginning 
of my sophomore year of high 
school, and revisiting my earliest 
playlists now is funny, if not 
wince-inducing. One in particular, 
entitled 
“nighttime,” 
bounces 
between Red Hot Chili Peppers, 
Iron & Wine, Ellie Goulding, City 
and Colour, OneRepublic and 
Neutral Milk Hotel, among various 
others. It’s a mix that I’m not sure I 
could stomach today, but one with 
songs that still hold a special place 
in my heart.
I hate to say that Pitchfork was 
the sole resource used in my quest 
to discover my taste — aimless 
listening on Pandora can only 
take you so far — for two reasons. 
First, there’s something inherently 
dangerous about idolizing one 
publication’s 
preferences 
over 
another’s 
— 
something 
I’ve 
been guilty of on more than one 
occasion. At the end of the day, an 
album review is only one writer’s 
opinion. Second, Pitchfork really 
wasn’t my only resource. Right 
around the same time I immersed 
myself in the publication, I realized 
that many of my friends were also 
beginning to discover how much 
music was really out there. We 
began to have conversations about 
Kendrick Lamar, Passion Pit, 
MGMT, Bon Iver … the list goes on.
“If I don’t think you know just 
what you’re doing / You pretend to 
know exactly all the things you keep 
on moving”
Our listening didn’t go very 
deep, and there’s no way we really 
knew what we were talking about 
— I’m pretty sure I still generally 

don’t — but we were learning about 
music and about ourselves. The 
way that we listened changed, as 
did what listening meant. We were 
no longer beholden to our parents’ 
tastes. Instead, the music that we 
liked, or chose to like, became a sort 
of identifier. It was a way to align 
ourselves with certain beliefs, a 
particular aesthetic, people we 
thought were cool. Discovering a 
new artist felt personal and unique 
and good. Looking back, my first 
real romantic relationship (with 
the 
aforementioned 
girlfriend) 
was initially based almost entirely 
on music recommendations we’d 
send back and forth and the 
conversations that would come 
from them. She adored punk folk-
rockers AJJ, and I showed her San 
Fermin, with their soaring brass 
melodies and oh so crisp vocals.
It sounds silly, almost fake, 
like I’m putting music on too 
tall a pedestal, but my earliest 
understandings of the world truly 
beyond my hometown of East 
Grand Rapids came from music. 
AJJ’s “American Tune” (“So if I 
see a penny on the ground / I leave 
it alone or fucking flip it / I’m a 
straight white male in America / 
I’ve got all the luck I need”) was 
my introduction to the concept 
of privilege. Perfume Genius, 
Blood Orange and Owen Pallett 
illustrated what it means to be 
gay in America while Kendrick 
and Vince Staples detailed their 
struggles as Black men, both 
realities that I still learn about 
every day. At the same time, Pedro 
The Lion’s discography led me to 
questions about my faith and about 
who and what people actually are.
“People / Always got to wash 
them at their ends.

Fast forward to just under 
a year after Folly Beach. I’m 
walking between Mason Hall and 
the UMMA, Animal Collective’s 
Strawberry Jam playing through 
my headphones. It’s the beginning 
of a new semester — winter of my 
freshman year at U of M.
“What’s pain? What’s sadness 
anyway? It’s not crying like a child

A proper home: on Animal Collective and finding mine

wild”
I am scared.
The day I come back from 
holiday 
break, 
I 
hallucinate 
my friends’ voices outside my 
dorm room, thinking they had 
followed me back from home. 
Maybe they’re going to surprise 
me. Their breaks are all almost a 
week longer than mine, so it’s not 
unfathomable. After more than a 
minute of wondering whether that 
really was Casey, Tristen, Elliot 
and Corey whom I hear outside, 
I get up from my bed and check 
the hallway. No one. The idea was 
ridiculous anyway. I check again, 
just to be sure.
“And an obsession with the past 
is like a dead fly / And just a few 
things are related to the ‘old times’ / 
Though we did believe in magic and 
we did die”
No, they haven’t planned a 
surprise visit. It really was too 
much to ask, but for some reason 
I’m still sad they aren’t there. I’ve 
just endured a full semester of 
friendlessness, save for my RA, 
and I can’t help but remember the 
faces of high school acquaintances 
when I told them the best friend I 
had made was someone whose job 
it was to make me feel welcome. 
The two weeks at home for holiday 
break were paradise, one that I 
loathed to relinquish. “Maybe I 
don’t belong here,” I think. “Maybe 
I should just go home.” Though a 
bit dramatic, the sentiment was 
real, especially when I was in the 
thick of it.
“Our homes are all white / And 
we go dancing on a lake / And 
sleds will carry us tonight / And 
snowflakes will blow us on our way”
One of my friends whom I had 
hoped would visit (and actually 
has many times since) had long 
insisted that I listen to Animal 
Collective, and something about 
my loneliness prompted me to 
take his recommendation more 
seriously. January of freshman 
year, 
I 
began 
listening 
to 
Strawberry Jam. The evil, dark 
quality of the band’s work that had 
previously repulsed me was now 
alluring. Within hours I found 
myself 
completely 
enamored, 
practically seduced (for lack of a 

better word). Where Merriweather 
is lush, rolling, spacious, perfect 
for spring break, Strawberry Jam is 
harsh and less melodically direct. 
Opener “Peacebone” begins with 
chaotic noise and contains some 
of Dave Portner’s (aka Avey Tare) 
best screaming.
After a couple of weeks, I 
decided that the album was 
perfect, and one cut resonated 
especially well. “I only want the 
time / to do one thing that I like … / 
take a walk out in the light drizzle / 
at the end of the day / when there’s 
no one watching,” Lennox sings 
on “Chores.” After this forceful 
chorus, he fades into a soft, 
wordless duet with Lennox. At the 
time, walking was my number-one 
hobby, and something that I did 
for probably an hour or two every 
night.
“Do you want to stroll down the 
financial street? / Our clothes might 
get soaked but the buildings sleep 
/ And there’s no one pushing for a 
place / As we end up at an easy pace”
If I couldn’t figure out how 
to make friends, I could at least 
take pride in my knowledge of 
the streets of Ann Arbor, of the 
storefronts and shortcuts, what I 
thought were the best kept secrets 
of the miserable college town — 
I’m not sure I can justify calling 
it a city — where I found myself 
ensnared. I didn’t have anyone to 
walk with, but as soon as I found 
someone, oh! the places we would 
go.
It’s cliché, but the music 
pulled me through that time. I 
invested myself in this band and 
felt rewarded. I dug deeper, into 
Feels, into Spirit They’ve Gone, 
Spirit They’ve Vanished and into 
Campfire Songs. The music was 
weird and unlike any other I had 
ever heard. The further back I 
listened, the weirder it got and the 
more my fascination grew. Sounds 
I had never heard before opened 
up my mind to possibilities for 
creation, the likes of which I had 
never imagined. A song can be 
anything. It can carry a narrative, 
it can make no sense at all to 
anyone other than the writer, it 
doesn’t need to serve any purpose 
and it certainly isn’t even remotely 
beholden to the stifling laws of 
reality.
“Feeling envy for the kid who’ll 
dance despite anything / I walk out 
in the flowers and feel better / If I 
could just leave my body for the 
night”
The group’s founding members, 
Portner and Lennox, released 
their first collaborative effort, 
Spirit They’ve Gone, Spirit They’ve 
Vanished, in 2000 when they 
were just 21 and 22, respectively. 
The album is noisy, psychedelic 
and 
long-winded. 
Its 
hyper, 
unpredictable quality makes it a 
challenging listen, and if you don’t 
believe me, I invite you to listen 
to “Untitled.” See how long you 
last. While Spirit They’ve Gone is 
aggressive and difficult to parse, 
something about it feels attainable. 
The 
narrative 
structures 
(or 
sometimes complete lack thereof) 
are nuanced but not clearly 
defined, and the instrumentation 
is 
sparse: 
synthesizer, 
piano, 
Lennox’s lifelike percussion and 
the occasional acoustic guitar. 
This album was recorded largely 
in Portner’s parents’ home, and it’s 
not difficult to tell.
Portner and Lennox used the 
tools they had at hand in the limited 
space that was available to them 
to create something completely 
original. Though the album is 
rough around the edges, especially 
before 
it 
was 
professionally 
remastered, they pioneered a new 
sound. They aren’t snobbish about 
their music, and they certainly 
don’t put an excessive quantity of 
effort into maintaining a heavily 
curated image. They proved to me 
that I could make something. I just 
needed to start.
“I’ll, I’ll, I’ll, I’ll, someday, 
someday… / Someday, someday, 
someday, 
someday… 
/Someday, 
someday, someday, someday…”
What was even more exciting 
was the way that these two 
20-somethings 
were 
expressly 
against tradition, or at least against 
a blind acceptance of the path in 
front of them. Before the release 
of Sung Tongs in 2004, all but one 
of the now four band members 
decided to drop out of school in 
order to focus on music. A pretty 
hardy move, and Portner has 
recalled during interviews how he 
spent no insignificant amount of 
time collecting on unemployment, 
in and out of his parents’ house 

without a reliable income.
“You don’t have to go to college”
I don’t believe that I will ever 
make anything as good as what 
Animal Collective has created, 
and dropping out of school to 
pursue music is the last thing I 
would consider. I have, however, 
since that fateful winter semester, 
redoubled my efforts into learning 
guitar. I try to write melodies 
whenever I can and pen down 
lyrics in my spare time, all of 
them bad. Nevertheless, I feel 
encouraged to continue whenever 
I listen, and not just in the realm of 
creating music itself.
When I first delved into Animal 
Collective’s prolific discography 
— Winter 2016 — it was with the 
knowledge that they would be 
releasing a new album, Painting 
With, in mid-February. Having 
been frustrated with the way 
I carried myself first semester, 
actively 
listening 
to 
Animal 
Collective was just one of many 
decisions I made leading into the 
new year. I was fed up with the 
sheer amount of time I’d wasted 
on Netflix, done with spending 
my 
Friday 
nights 
watching 
whatever was on Comedy Central. 
Something, I decided, needed to 
change.
“We can get him started, yeah / 
Bad mind, let me put on good habits 
/ Been working to put on good 
habits / Sometimes I can’t find my 
good habits”
I 
began 
taking 
chances, 
reaching out to people I’d met 
briefly first semester and finding 
opportunities around campus. I 
remember being elated when I 
found someone who would go to 
the San Fermin show with me that 
January — someone I still regard 
today as one of my closest friends. 
I joined a few organizations, 
including The Daily, and though 
I was disappointed by the culture 
of organizations in general — so 
many students were just looking 
for résumé padding — I met 
beautiful, wonderful, optimistic 
and creative people.
My application to the Arts 
section of The Daily contained 
a review of Animal Collective’s 
Painting With. The trajectory that 
began with Merriweather in 2015 
and continued through Strawberry 
Jam and the rest through 2016 
finally found me among a group of 
people who had as much a desire 
to interact with the arts as I had. 
They can be pretentious (as can 
I), and I don’t always agree with 
them, but they’ve collectively 
provided me with a space where I 
can be creative, self-reflective and, 
above all, self-indulgent.
“Now I think it’s alright to feel 
inhuman / Now I think that’s a riot 
/ Now I think it’s alright we’ll sing 
together / Now I think that’s a riot”
It’s difficult for me to credit 
Animal Collective for my eventual 
adjustment to life at college, but 
the fact that my immersion in 
their music coincided with an 
exponential increase in my social 
confidence 
and 
understanding 
of myself as someone with a real 
personality, emotions, influence 
and responsibility is something I 
can neither shake nor deny. What 
is certain to me is that I would 
not be who I am today had I never 
listened to them. The degree to 
which I would be different is up for 
debate, and not something I want 
to explore on paper — on screen? 
— but still an interesting idea to 
entertain.
“Am I really all the things that are 
outside of me? / Would I complete 
myself without the things I like 
around?”
The details of this story, if one 
could call it that, are personal, but 
the context surrounding those 
details is hopefully somewhat 
universal. I’d like to think that most 
university students experience a 
time of extended loneliness, or at 
least a transient sense of not fitting 
in. Maybe my story will encourage 
those who, upon reading, find 
themselves 
in 
that 
position. 
Maybe a reader or two will be 
intrigued by my obsession with 
Animal Collective and give them 
a listen. And maybe, just maybe, 
those readers will find in Animal 
Collective what I’ve found, or will 
identify with my love for Animal 
Collective through whatever band 
or artist has narrated the recent 
years of their own lives. Whatever 
the case may be, dear reader, I 
hope you’ve found something 
human here.
“Oh there will be time to fish fry, 
for letters by, yours truly / Yours 
truly”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK


Feb 5, 2018

Daniel Day-Lewis is regarded 

as one of Hollywood’s most 
versatile and skilled character 
actors. In the wake of his 
recent announcement that he 
is retiring from acting, the 
State Theater commemorated 
his 
legacy 
by 
screening 
a 

series of his most celebrated 
performances. The series began 
with “My Left Foot” (1989) 
— the movie that earned Day-
Lewis his first Oscar for his 

incredibly challenging role of 
Christy Brown, an artist with 
cerebral palsy. In an almost 
complete 
role 
reversal, 
the 

following film “The Last of the 
Mohicans” 
(1992) 
spotlights 

Day-Lewis as a hunky, tanned 
leading man, the adopted son 
of the Mohican tribe who 
fights in the French and Indian 
War, with a luxurious mass 
of hair and a deeply V-necked 
blouse. In the third film, “In 
the Name of the Father” (1993), 
Day-Lewis again proves his 
talent and intrigue as an actor, 
depicting the emotional turmoil 
of the wrongly convicted Gerry 
Conlon in the aftermath of the 
IRA terrorist attack in 1974 
London.

These 
first 
three 
films 

are all solid and interesting 
performances by Day-Lewis, 
ones that put him on the map as 
a skilled and promising actor. 
But it’s not until “Gangs of New 
York” (2002) that Day-Lewis 
embodies 
the 
performative 

streak that becomes his legacy. 
In 
Scorsese’s 
chaotic 
and 

enduring portrayal of urban 
criminality 
and 
immigrant 

factionism, 
Day-Lewis 
plays 

the brutal but charismatic war 

chief of Old New York, hovering 
between flamboyant charm and 
deranged bloodlust. Next in the 
film series was the critically 
acclaimed 
Spielberg 
film 

“Lincoln” (2012), where Day-
Lewis becomes unrecognizable 

as the titular 16th president, 
wholly 
embodying 
Lincoln’s 

voice, 
mannerisms 
and 

magnetic presence. The series 
rounded out with Paul Thomas 
Anderson’s 
“There 
Will 
Be 

Blood” 
(2007), 
where 
Day-

Lewis plays a more subdued but 
power-hungry oil magnate in 
the black gold frenzy of the late 
19th and early 20th centuries. 
Arguably his most compelling 
performance, 
Day-Lewis’s 

seedy lust for wealth and his 
indifference to being soaked in 
oil is absolutely mesmerizing.

Day-Lewis’s acting career is a 

collection of unbelievably taxing 
and 
impressive 
roles, 
each 

demanding a deeply complex 
and fully imagined person. He 
is one of Hollywood’s greatest, 
proving time and time again his 
ability to completely embody his 
role, including his immersive 
method 
acting 
preparation 

(he hunted game to prep for 
“Mohicans” 
and 
shadowed 

a butcher for “Gangs of New 
York”). With heavy hearts, the 
film community says goodbye to 
this master of the silver screen; 
Day-Lewis officially announced 
his retirement from acting, 
with his newest film “Phantom 
Thread” as his swan song.

In “Phantom Thread,” Day-

Lewis undertakes the most 
challenging and most subdued 
role of his career. He plays 
Reynolds Woodcock, a polished, 
elegant designer of women’s 
couture. He is a narcissistic 
genius, wholly consumed with 
himself and his own brilliance, 
whose designs are worthy of 
the praise. The opening scene 
of the film is one of the most 
captivating 
and 
gorgeously 

done sequences in cinema — 
we see Woodcock meticulously 
grooming himself in a series 
of simple frames that together 
introduce his detail-oriented 
personality, his refinement and 
his quiet magnetism.

The stormy dynamic between 

Woodcock and Alma (Vicky 

Krieps, 
“The 
Colony”), 
a 

waitress he quickly becomes 
infatuated with, is the binding 
thread of the film. She becomes 
his muse, living in his house 
and modeling for his designs 
— in many scenes she is like a 
porcelain mannequin, draped 
in luxurious fabric, more of a 
doll than a person. But Krieps 
does a brilliant job of shading 
Alma with layers of nuance, 
showing both her eagerness for 
the trappings of Woodcock’s 
world and her trepidation at the 
uselessness of it all.

“Phantom Thread” is a dark, 

moving drama peppered with 
moments 
of 
subtle 
hilarity 

that 
ring 
true 
to 
director 

Paul 
Thomas 
Anderson’s 

unorthodox sense of humor. 
Stitching the film together is 
a spectacular score by Johnny 
Greenwood (“There Will Be 
Blood”), of Radiohead fame. 
His composition is sharp and 

quivering, 
needle-like 
and 

sweepingly elegant, like the 
fabric of Woodcock’s gowns. 
It’s enough to make Alexandre 
Desplat shake in his boots. 
The costume design is also 
incredible, with each scene 
featuring a collection of artfully 
tailored couture gowns.

“Phantom Thread” is a quietly 

haunting film and a homage 
to the radiance of Daniel Day-
Lewis. It is an elegant sendoff 
to a man who has made his 
irrevocable 
mark 
on 
the 

industry and his audiences.

The Zell Visiting Writers 

Series 
brings 
writers 
from 

across the country and world to 
Ann Arbor to engage with the 
community 
through 
various 

events, 
including 
a 
public 

reading, a Q&A session and 
workshops. MFA students are 
able to work directly with visiting 
writers through direct forums 
and feedback from writers about 
student work. The Q&A sessions 
are also open to undergrad 
students. It’s a great way to share 
a space with the visiting writers 
and be surrounded by people who 
are incredibly passionate about 
their work. During these visits, 
writers share their personal 
experiences behind their writing 
and encourage young writers by 
sharing their backgrounds.

The Zell Visiting Writers 

Series will kick off their first 
visit of the semester with visiting 
writers Jane Hirshfield and 
Brit Bennett. Hirshfield has 
written eight books of poetry, 
earning immense praise and 
numerous 
awards. 
Among 

these awards, she has received 
the 
Guggenheim 
Foundation 

fellowship, 
Rockefeller 

Foundation fellowship, Academy 
of American Poets Fellowship 
and 
National 
Endowment 

for the Arts fellowship. Brit 

Bennett returns to Ann Arbor 
after receiving her MFA at the 
University to share her work, 
which has been featured in 
publications such as The New 
Yorker and The New York Times 
Magazine. During her time in 
Ann Arbor, she received the 
2014 Hurston/Wright Award for 
College Writers and a Hopwood 
Award in Graduate Short Fiction.

“The real purpose of the 

visiting writers series is to bring 
the 
world 
of 
contemporary 

literature to Ann Arbor, serve 
the local community and also to 
serve the MFA students,” said 
Maya West, Assistant Director 
of 
the 
Helen 
Zell 
Writers’ 

Program, in an interview with 
The Daily. “Many undergraduate 
Michigan students have a frame 
of reference for sports or politics 
or different kinds of celebrities. 
For contemporary literature, it’s 
a little more obscure. I would 
love to figure out a way to explain 
that.”

Many 
University 
students, 

particularly 
undergraduates, 

do 
not 
necessarily 
expose 

themselves to any form of 
contemporary literature beyond 
what is offered in the classroom. 
The Zell Visiting Writers Series 
allows students to spend time 
hearing from writers who are 
thriving and engaged with the 
impact of their literature. The 
series aims to bridge the gap 
between learning from classical 

texts 
studied 
in 
class 
and 

understanding the influence of 
contemporary literature today.

“I didn’t realize until I got to 

the university that the literary 
world is a living, breathing 
organism — not something that is 
sort of on a slab for us to dissect 

and study. It is something for us 

to talk to and engage with,” West 
said. “That can revolutionize our 
understanding and experience of 
all literature.”

In 
academic 
settings, 

students might feel like the tasks 
of essay writing and reading 
required texts forces them to 
pick apart literature in search of 
its meaning. West suggests that 
we engage with texts on a new 
level in efforts to understand 
how literature transforms, as 
well as understand how it is 
living among our current society. 
How does the literature of 
contemporary writers speak to 
the pressing issues and concerns 
of our world today?

“It is significant that young 

people who aren’t really involved 
with contemporary literature 
don’t realize that literature is 
a thriving, living community,” 
West said. “It’s not just dead 
people. It’s not just writing 
essays 
about 
names 
you’ve 

vaguely heard of.”

“I’ve succeeded at everything 

except my life.” Somehow, this 
statement rings true for the man 
who coined it, Serge Gainsbourg. 
Provocative, clever, intriguing 
and singular are just some of 
the words that can attempt 
to explain one of the most 
popular and influential singer-
songwriters to ever live. They 
can also be used to describe his 
1971 album Histoire de Melody 
Nelson, a perfect introduction to 
his rich discography.

Gainsbourg 
was 
born 

in 1928 in Paris to Jewish-
Ukranian parents, spending his 
adolescence under the shadow 
of 
Nazi-occupied 
France. 

Blending a series of genres from 
the traditional French chanson 
to the (at the time) increasingly 
popular rock and funk, he 
created a style of music that 
was unprecedented and unique 
— accompanied by lyrics that 
were clever, dark and sensual. 
He eventually grew into one of 
the biggest celebrities on the 
French and world stage, having 
highly publicized relationships 

with Jane Birkin and Brigitte 
Bardot, fathering actor and 
musician Charlotte Gainsbourg 
with the former.

Running at just less than 

half an hour, Histoire de Melody 
Nelson 
is 
a 
self-contained 

concept 
album 
in 
which 

Gainsbourg narrates the story 
of a middle-aged man who 
accidentally collides his car 
with the bicycle of the teenage 
Melody Nelson (“Princess of 
shadows, 
cursed 
archangel, 

Modern Amazon”) as well as 
that of the ensuing romance. 
The lyrics and subject matter 
are 
typical 
Gainsbourg: 

seductive yet repellent, rich 
with 
description 
and 
filled 

with worldplay. Gainsbourg’s 
voice, barely above a whisper 
at certain points, simply glides 
over the instrumentals. They 
resemble spoken word narration 
more often than actual singing, 
and you can practically envision 
Gainsbourg 
sitting 
in 
front 

of you with his trademark 
disheveled look and a cigarette 
in his hand. He is joined by Jane 
Birkin for “Melody,” “Ballade 
de Melody Nelson” and “Cargo 
Culte,” who similarly pops in 
and out, barely above a whisper.

Despite the lyrics playing 

a large part, the album is still 
a rewarding listen for non-
French 
speakers. 
Composer 

Jean-Claude Vannier provides 
a set of lush, operatic orchestral 
arrangements. 
“L’hôtel 

particulier” features the best 
example, as most of it simply 
features 
Gainsbourg 
slowly 

describing 
a 
mysterious 

mansion (with “long endless 
passages, 
spiral 
stairways 

decorated 
with 
Baroque 

bronzes, golden angels”) with 
the backing of a bass guitar and 
slightly syncopated guitar line. 
However, at the end of each verse, 
strings suddenly appear and 
beautifully accent Gainsbourg’s 
final description. The last third 
of the song features only the 
strings, beckoning the listener 
to fill in what transpires after 
Gainsbourg finishes his tale.

Histoire de Melody Nelson has 

had an immeasurable impact 
on both French pop music, as 
well as genres such as trip-hop, 
even showing up as a sample 
in a De La Soul song. It as an 
album as complex and filled 
with contradictions as the man 
himself, and a must-listen for 
any fan of pop music.

For the second straight game, 

the No. 20 Michigan hockey 
team denied No. 12 Penn State’s 
offense — ranked the best in 
the nation with four goals per 
game coming into the weekend 
— quality chances throughout 
most of the evening.

For the second time in as 

many nights, Jack LaFontaine 
skated out to fellow sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne to 
give him a bear hug as the final 
horn sounded.

And 
for 
the 
second 

consecutive 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines (7-7-2-1 Big Ten, 
12-10-2 overall) headed into the 
dressing room and sang “The 
Victors” — a sign of a weekend 
sweep — after avoiding a late 
disaster 
and 
defeating 
the 

Nittany Lions (6-7-3-2, 13-10-3), 
3-2, Saturday night.

“I’m really proud of our 

players, they found a way to 
win the game,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “We came 
a little unglued there, we didn’t 
play the situation with the extra 
attacker at the end very well.

“… 
But 
overall, 
great 

weekend. … We’ve been on the 

other end where we’ve felt that 
we should’ve done better for us 
this year, so it all evens out. But 
great effort, great win for our 
team.”

It took just 26 seconds into 

regulation for Michigan to 
strike first. After an odd-man 
rush for Penn State to open the 
game, the Wolverines broke out 
of their defensive zone with a 
three-on-one counterattack.

Junior 
forward 
Brendan 

Warren found a streaking Josh 
Norris down the middle of 
the ice, and the new linemates 
didn’t 
miss 
a 
beat. 
The 

freshman forward took the 
puck and buried a one-timer 
for his second goal in as many 
contests, putting Michigan on 
the board first.

After a dominant 4-0 victory 

Friday night, the Wolverines 
picked up right where they 
left off, firing on all cylinders 
early. Michigan easily entered 
its offensive zone, maintained 
control 
of 
the 
puck 
and 

quickly stifled Nittany Lion 
opportunities on the other end 
of the ice.

Halfway 
through 
the 

opening period, Penn State was 
called for interference, and the 
Wolverines found themselves 

on the power play for the first 
time. After going 0-for-4 with 
the man advantage the previous 
night, Michigan made sure its 
golden opportunity wouldn’t go 
to waste this time around.

With 34 seconds left on the 

power play, and after a handful 
of 
quality 
chances, 
senior 

forward Dexter Dancs received 
a pass from junior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi in front of 
the net and stuffed it past 
goaltender Peyton Jones’ right 
pad to double the lead.

The Nittany Lions had a 

power play of their own with 
three minutes to go in the first 
period, but Lavigne stood tall 
between the pipes to make some 
key saves — including one with 
the toe of his skate — and keep 
the two-goal advantage intact.

The second period began 

with Penn State knocking on the 
doorstep, with multiple scoring 
chances in the opening minutes. 
And less than six minutes 
into the stanza, sophomore 
defenseman Griffin Luce was 
called for interference, giving 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 
another 

opportunity to tack on their 
first goal of the weekend.

But again, timely saves from 

Lavigne — including seven 

on the ensuing penalty kill 
— protected the Wolverines’ 
lead. Despite being outshot 
17 to eight, Lavigne’s mix of 
both routine and flashy saves, 
combined with solid play in 
the defensive zone, muted the 
powerhouse Penn State offense 
for the fifth straight period.

Lavigne would go on to make 

a career-high 43 saves on 45 
shots, a feat Pearson chalked 
up to his netminder’s newfound 
confidence and composure in 
the crease.

“I thought we got away from 

our game in the second period 
and Hayden did a great job of 
keeping us in,” Pearson said. 
“… We had to rely too much 
on 
Hayden 
this 
weekend, 

especially tonight. He was the 
star of the game.

“He just looks like he’s so 

calm in the net and he’s in the 
zone. He made some great saves 
in that second period, you just 
shake your head. But when 
you’re on, you’re on.”

The third period started with 

back and forth play, with both 
teams creating similar scoring 
chances and their respective 
goaltenders making highlight-
reel saves to continue the 
stalemate. Through the first ten 

minutes, Michigan narrowly 
outshot the Nittany Lions seven 
to six.

With 7:25 left in the final 

period, Luce was assessed a 
penalty for roughing, giving 
Penn 
State 
its 
third 
man 

advantage. However, 37 seconds 
later, forward Andrew Sturtz 
was 
called 
for 
goaltender 

interference after running into 
Lavigne, resulting in four-on-
four play.

And with 12 seconds left of 

both sides being down a man, 
forward Dakota Raabe received 
a crisp outlet pass from junior 
defenseman Luke Martin and 
found himself on a breakaway. 
The freshman deked Jones and 
laid the puck into the back of 
the net for his first career goal 
and a bit of insurance — which 
seemingly all but solidified the 
win and weekend sweep for the 
Wolverines.

“(That was) a big goal from 

Dakota Raabe in a critical 
moment,” Pearson said. “It 
didn’t seem like it was a huge 
goal, but it ends up being 
the winning goal, so good 
for 
Dakota. 
We’re 
getting 

contributions from a lot of 
players now and that makes us 
a better team.”

Though 
down 
by 
three 

goals, Penn State and its deadly 
offense 
wouldn’t 
go 
away 

without putting up a fight. With 
1:57 remaining in the game and 
an extra attacker for the Nittany 
Lions, forward Liam Folks 
tapped the puck into the net off 
an errant rebound to finally get 
Penn State on the board. Sixty-
four seconds later, defenseman 
Kris Myllari snuck a shot under 
the crossbar to cut the deficit to 
one with just 53 seconds to go.

But 
as 
was 
the 
case 

throughout the entire weekend, 
Lavigne made his presence 
known in net as the final 
seconds ticked off the clock and 
three blocked shots in the last 
minute preserved the win — 
and the sweep.

“You just have to stay calm 

in that moment,” Lavigne said. 
“Obviously, that’s not the swing 
you want to see when you’re 
up 3-0, especially not against 
a team like that, but we know 
they can score and they put the 
puck to the net.

“But when that happened, we 

all just took a deep breath and 
I don’t think they got another 
shot after it was 3-2. We locked 
it down defensively and paid the 
price to win.”

Michigan earns second consecutive sweep

Pearson’s plan already paying off

M

el Pearson has always 
had a plan.

It involved over-

hauling an entire offense — as he 
had at previous stops — with a 
group primar-
ily made up of 
veterans who 
were used to a 
different style 
of hockey.

By his own 

admission, 
and under-
standably, that 
plan takes 
time. It’s one 
that he admits 
the Wolverines struggled with 
over the first half of their season.

But, if the last few weeks are 

any indication, that plan is finally 
coming to fruition.

And to anyone outside Yost Ice 

Arena with reasonable expecta-
tions for this team with largely 
the same personnel as last year, 
that progress happened a lot 
quicker than they could have 
expected.

With this weekend’s sweep 

over No. 12 Penn State, Michigan 
already surpassed its 2016-17 con-
ference win total. A week prior, 
the Wolverines went to Minne-
apolis and left having recorded 
their first sweep of the conference 
season against then-No. 9 Min-
nesota. It was the first time in 41 
years that they swept the Golden 
Gophers at Mariucci Arena.

If that wasn’t significant 

enough, when the horn sounded 
on Saturday night’s victory over 
the Nittany Lions, it marked the 
first time Michigan swept back-
to-back weekends in three years.

The weekend was by no means 

perfect.

There were still defensive zone 

turnovers, though goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne largely rendered 
them irrelevant.

The only time he didn’t was 

late in the third period Saturday 
night, when Penn State pulled its 
goaltender for an extra attacker 
and turned a 3-0 blowout into a 

3-2 nail-biter with 53.3 seconds 
remaining.

And then there was the second 

period, one in which the Nittany 
Lions outshot Michigan, 17-8. In 
that frame, Pearson admitted that 
the Wolverines “took a little bit of 
a step back” from the systems that 
have yielded their recent success.

Overall, though?
“We’re getting there,” Pearson 

said.

That they are. The fact remains 

that Michigan went toe-to-toe 
with the top-ranked offense in 
college hockey this weekend. The 
Nittany Lions entered the series 
averaging four goals and 40 shots 
per game. Not to mention they 
seven goals in two games when 
the teams met in State College in 
October.

Some of that remained the 

same, some of it didn’t.

Penn State stuck to its identity, 

letting 79 shots loose on the week-
end. But Michigan shut them out 
Friday night, and was just under 
two minutes away 
from doing so 
again Saturday.

The perfor-

mance on the 
opposite end was 
equally represen-
tative of progress.

The Wolver-

ines got only one 
goal from their 
top line, a power-
play goal by Dex-
ter Dancs in the second period 
Saturday night. Michigan’s two 
Hobey Baker candidates — Coo-
per Marody and Tony Calderone 
— didn’t record a single point on 
the weekend.

Instead, for the first time this 

season, Michigan got most of its 
contributions from somewhere 
else.

Freshman Dakota Raabe 

scored his first 
goal of the season 
Saturday night 
in what would 
end up being the 
game-winner. A 
night prior, fresh-
man Jack Becker 
found twine 
twice, despite 
lighting the lamp 
only once enter-
ing the series.

Holistically, the Wolverines 

have come a long way since Sep-
tember.

But that’s all a part of Pearson’s 

plan, too. And as he describes it, 
he needed Michigan to buy in at 
the beginning.

“I think that’s the biggest 

thing,” he says.

In part, “buying in” comes with 

breaking habits. Pearson isn’t 
willing to call them bad habits, 
per se. But the habits may run 
counterintuitive to the larger sys-
tem. Early on, when the going got 
tough, those habits resurfaced. 
They’re still not entirely gone 
either — Saturday night’s second 
period being Pearson’s evidence 
of such.

But with consecutive sweeps 

and two narrow losses to Notre 
Dame in the last three weeks, that 
system has been validated.

“It’s proven now,” Pearson said. 

“We can lean on them a little bit 
more now and say, ‘Hey, we play 
like this, here’s the results. If we 
don’t here’s the period we can 
have.’ It’s good. But we’ve got to 
make sure our guys — our scorers 

who maybe have a tough night 
— they’ve got to continue to play 
the way we’ve been playing. And 
they’ll be reminded of that this 
week.”

Added Lavigne: “I think there 

was definitely a little bit of frus-
tration with the hot and cold 
streaks we were having earlier in 
the year. Now we’re kind of seeing 
the benefits of it (and) it’s more 
motivating to stay with it. And we 
know that what we’re up to now 
is working and in the long run can 
lead to good things.”

It sure looks like it.
So ask Mel Pearson if he 

expected this much progress this 
quickly, and he’ll admit that it 
takes time. He’ll say he needed 
the buy in. He’ll say he needed to 
break habits to get here, and that 
it’s easier for his team to under-
stand it when the results come 
with it.

But those results are coming 

now.

Michigan split with Minnesota 

in November, then swept the 
Golden Gophers last weekend. 
Michigan split with Penn State 
in October, then swept them this 
weekend, too.

Of course, that doesn’t mean 

Pearson’s work is done. 

“We saw six consecutive games 

where we’ve come out hard and 
played well, and played collective-
ly as a team for a full 60,” Lavigne 
said Saturday. “I think that’s kind 
of showing us that we can play at 
any level with anybody here. The 
Big Ten’s extremely strong this 
year and we’ve seen that we can 
compete within our conference. 
So the next step is getting into 
that tournament and competing 
nationally.”

Maybe they won’t make the 

tournament. Maybe they won’t 
win the Big Ten, either. 

But with every plan comes 

measured steps. Consider step 
one a success.

beginning.

Raabe’s reward: anatomy of a first goal

On 
a 
Tuesday 
afternoon 

following a preseason practice 
in September, Michigan hockey 
coach Mel Pearson was asked 
about the potential impact of the 
Wolverines’ incoming class of 
freshmen.

Pearson 
highlighted 
the 

obvious names — forward Josh 
Norris, a first-round NHL Draft 
pick last June, and defenseman 
Quinn Hughes, a likely top-
10 selection next summer — 
calling them “worth the price 
of admission.” But alongside 
those two blue-chip prospects, 
Pearson also brought up a lesser-
known newcomer.

“We’ve got a kid named 

Dakota Raabe,” Pearson said, 
“who’s shown really well so far.”

A dedicated observer might 

have 
been 
familiar 
with 

Raabe’s skill and skating ability. 
The 
5-foot-9 
forward 
from 

Capistrano Beach, Ca. spent 
three productive years with the 
Wenatchee Wild of the BCHL, 
where he notched 58 points in 58 
games his final season.

However, through Michigan’s 

first 23 games, the casual or first-
time hockey spectator would 
have had a hard time detecting 
Raabe’s presence. If one only 
looked at the boxscore, they 
might not have noticed him at 
all. Coming into this weekend, 
Raabe was the only Wolverine, 
save 
goaltenders 
Hayden 

Lavigne and Jack LaFontaine, 
to not have registered a single 
point.

But that’s not what Pearson 

or Michigan’s coaching staff 
focused on.

On Friday night, freshman 

forward Jack Becker scored 
the Wolverines’ first two goals 
in a 4-0 rout of Penn State — 
the first multi-goal game of 
his career. After the game, 
Pearson was asked if Becker’s 
performance was indicative of 
players growing into their roles, 
something Pearson has stressed 
constantly.

“Some nights you’re rewarded 

offensively with some points, 

and others you’re not, but you 
still have to bring it every night,” 
he said. “It’s good to see guys 
rewarded for all their hard work. 
I thought Dakota Raabe — I don’t 
know if Dakota’s got a point 
yet, but I had someone call me 
this week and say, ‘Wow, who’s 
that 12 (Raabe’s jersey number) 
playing at Minnesota? I mean, he 
was all over the 
place!’

“He’s 
doing 

some 
good 

things, 
killing 

some 
penalties. 

He’s not maybe 
putting up the 
points, but his 
contributions 
aren’t 
unnoticed.”

To a trained 

eye such as Pearson’s, those 
contributions 
have 
been 

on full display the past few 
weeks. During the third period 
last 
Saturday 
at 
Minnesota, 

Michigan’s third line of Raabe 

and sophomores Adam Winborg 
and James Sanchez suffocated 
the Golden Gophers with a 
clutch, 
45-second 
shift 
in 

which the puck never left the 
Minnesota zone.

Raabe has found a home on the 

Wolverines’ penalty-kill as well. 
The unit was languishing before 
this weekend, having stopped 

just 75 percent of 
their opponents’ 
chances 
— 

ranking 
among 

the 
five 
worst 

teams 
in 
the 

country.

The 
Nittany 

Lions 
— 
who 

rank 
sixteenth 

in the nation on 
the 
power-play 

— had five such 

opportunities against Michigan, 
and failed to capitalize on a 
single one. Raabe played an 
integral role in all of them, 
making crucial clearances on a 
number of chances, and swiftly 

skating all over the ice to stifle 
Penn State’s attack.

“He’s 
done 
a 
good 
job,” 

Pearson said Saturday. “He’s 
given us some speed, but … 
he’s playing grittier. Getting 
involved, he’s got a good stick. 
He was a good scorer in junior 
hockey last year, he’s capable and 
he killed penalties. So he’s smart 
enough, he can understand on 
the PK what to do.”

Pearson’s 
final 
comments 

Friday 
expressed 
optimism 

about Raabe’s future.

“You’d like to see him get 

rewarded,” Pearson said, “and 
he will eventually.”

With just under six minutes to 

go in the third period Saturday, 
Michigan led Penn State 2-0. 
An earlier roughing penalty 
on 
sophomore 
defenseman 

Griffin Luce, coupled with an 
interference call on Nittany 
Lion forward Andrew Sturtz, 
had resulted in two minutes of 
4-on-4 hockey, half of which had 
already elapsed.

Penn State forward Liam 

Folkes chased the puck towards 
the boards behind the net, 
but 
Michigan 
defenseman 

Sam Piazza got there first. 
Piazza chipped it left towards 
sophomore defenseman Luke 
Martin, who put his stick on the 
puck and turned up the ice.

Looking up, Martin saw Raabe 

streaking ahead 
of everyone near 
center-ice. With 
three 
players 

on either side of 
the passing lane, 
he would need a 
perfect effort to 
hit his target.

Martin 
took 

four 
strides 

forward 
and 

let fly near the 
right circle. The puck found the 
sweet-spot of Raabe’s stick like a 
quarterback hitting a receiver on 
a fly pattern. A picture-perfect 
“dime,” to borrow more from 
football terminology.

It was clear no one was going 

to catch Raabe from behind. 
Peyton Jones, the Penn State 
goaltender, was the only chance.

Raabe turned up the ice and 

towards the net. When he was 
about three feet in front of Jones, 
he held the puck out to his right. 
Then, just as soon as it was there, 
Raabe pulled it away.

The next time 

Jones 
saw 
the 

puck, it was in 
the back of the 
net.

Yost Ice Arena 

erupted. 
Raabe 

raised both his 
arms in jubilation 
as his momentum 
carried him into 
the 
embrace 

of 
Piazza 
and 

sophomore forward Jake Slaker. 
The Wolverines led the No. 12 
team in the nation by three goals 
with five minutes to play.

The goal itself was such a 

textbook finish, you’d think 
Raabe had done it before. Raabe, 
in fact, couldn’t even recollect 
the play.

“Honestly, 
I 
don’t 
even 

remember it,” he said. “I think I 
blacked out when I did it. Great 
pass by Martin and it was a great 
experience for sure.”

But 
while 
he 
may 
not 

remember 
exactly 
how 
it 

happened, 
Raabe 
certainly 

remembers the fact that for the 
first time in his college career, 
he had scored a goal. All his 
hard work killing penalties and 
chasing pucks around the ice had 
been rewarded.

Not only that, the Nittany 

Lions scored two goals in the 
game’s 
final 
two 
minutes, 

making Raabe’s first collegiate 
goal a game-winner.

It appears 23 goalless games 

were worth the wait.

“It was frustrating for sure,” 

Raabe said. “A lot of it was just 
— I think it’s just little things 
and I was trying to stay positive. 
At times, negatives would creep 
in, but I would just try to play it 
simple and just do what I could 
and what Mel wanted me to do.

“And it finally paid off.”

Senior point guard Katelynn Flahery led Michigan with 27 points in the 19th-ranked Wolverines’ 44-point win over Illinois on Saturday night.

Michigan throttles Illinois, 86-42

As the clock ran out in the 

first quarter, Katelynn Flaherty 
pulled up from the far right side 
at midcourt. The ball swished 
perfectly through the net.

“When I saw it was high 

enough, I was like, ‘It feels 
pretty good,’ ” Flaherty said. 
“Then it went in I was like, 
‘Wow, that’ll never happen 
again.’ ”

It was that kind of day for 

the No. 19 Michigan women’s 
basketball team, as it went on 
to defeat Illinois by 44 points, 
86-42.

After 
allowing 
a 
quick 

five points to start the game, 
the Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 
17-4 overall) were locked in. 
Throughout the final 8:10 of the 
quarter, Michigan outscored the 
Fighting Illini 24 to seven. The 
strong play in the first was the 
byproduct of team basketball.

Though, as often is the case, 

senior 
guard 
Flaherty 
was 

the star of the quarter. After 
missing her first three shots, 
Flaherty hit three straight 3s, 
including her half-court heave. 
Her typical strong performance 
continued, as she finished with 
27 points, eight assists, four 
rebounds and four steals.

After the opening surge, 

the 
Wolverines 
cooled 
off. 

Michigan and Illinois (0-7, 9-12) 
were even in the second, scoring 
12 apiece. The Wolverines went 
through a four-minute drought 
without a basket, but were 
able to maintain a lead with 
solid defense. The only place 
the Fighting Illini found some 
success in the first half was 
from behind the arc; 50 percent 
of their first-half points came 
off 3s.

While 
Michigan’s 
defense 

was extremely good in the first 
half, it was even better in the 
second.

“We did a really good job in 

the first half of taking away 
the foul line,” said coach Kim 

Barnes Arico. “They made some 
shots late in the shot clock and 
some off offensive rebounds (in 
the first half). So we knew if we 
could clean that up a little bit, 
we would be able to get more 
stops.”

And that’s exactly what they 

did. The Wolverines allowed 
just four points in the third 
quarter and 18 total points in 
the second half. Comparatively, 
Flaherty scored 14 and freshman 
forward Hailey Brown scored 11 
in the second half.

Brown had one of the best 

games of her young career, 
finishing with 17 points on 
6-of-9 shooting, a career-high 
14 rebounds and one block. She 
was a force down low, where 
Michigan outscored Illinois 40 
to 12.

“We 
knew 
when 
Hailey 

committed to us that she would 
be an outstanding addition 

to 
our 
program,” 
Barnes 

Arico said. “Hailey just keeps 
grinding, just keeps working 
and improving each and every 
single day. Last week she was 
recognized as freshman of the 
week nationally.”

Throughout the game, the 

Wolverines were able to create 
offense from their defense. 
Michigan forced 21 Fighting 
Illini 
turnovers, 
scoring 
31 

points 
off 
those 
mistakes. 

Illinois, on the other hand, had 
just two points off turnovers 
and four steals. Junior guard 
Nicole Munger had five steals of 
her own.

While it’s always nice to win 

by 44, the Wolverines shouldn’t 
be too surprised — the Fighting 
Illini 
have 
now 
lost 
eight 

straight.

Don’t expect it to be this easy 

when the Wolverines face rival 
Michigan State this Tuesday.

Rice, ‘M’ honor Flaherty’s record

For Katelynn Flaherty, it’s 

easy at this point. Wait for the 
defense to contract around a 
stampeding Jillian Dunston then 
slide in behind as the trailer. Three 
points. Run off a Hallie Thome 
pindown, leaving her defender 
behind. Three points. Or, loft one 
up from half-court, a heave that 
falls through the net as the buzzer 
sounds. Three points.

The senior guard does all of the 

above, all in the first quarter, on 
the way to a 44-point win over a 
conference opponent. It’s par for 
the course.

“Just crazy,” she said. “I do not 

know how the hell I would be able 
to do (a half-court shot) again.”

Flaherty is Michigan’s all-time 

leading scorer, an honor earned 
with a 3-pointer (what else?) at 
Nebraska last week, to move atop 

the list. Not the women’s basketball 
program’s all-time leading scorer, 
mind you — though she holds that 
honor as well. The school’s all-
time leading scorer. She passed 
Glen Rice’s record of 2,442 points, 
leaving the three-time NBA All-
Star in her dust.

Rice 
sent 
Flaherty 
a 

congratulatory Facebook message 
after the record was broken, but 
didn’t meet her in person until 
Sunday — a ceremony during 
a break in the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s win over Rutgers.

“I always say records are made 

to be broken and to be able to have 
it done by Katelynn, who’s had a 
tremendous career, tremendous 
athlete, tremendous scorer — I 
mean, God, that’s almost like 
another Glen Rice out there 
watching her shoot the basketball 
and do what she does,” Rice said. 
“For me, it’s an honor to even be in 
the same sentence as she is.”

Rice knew Flaherty was coming 

for his record well in advance, 
a reality of having a female 
sharpshooter who couldn’t leave 
early for the NBA in his midst. By 
Sunday, Flaherty was already at 
2,505 points, a virtue of dropping 
21 and 27 points in two games since 
breaking the record.

“When I found out I was gonna 

be coming here and scouting the 
game (for the Miami Heat) and 
they told me, ‘Oh yeah, you know, 
you’re not the all-time leading 
scorer anymore,’ ” Rice said, “I 
went, ‘Oh really, great. Let me 
guess: Katelynn.’ Yes, it was her. I 
(had) seen it coming, a while back.”

There’s a poetic justice to 

Flaherty — a sharpshooting guard 
whose favorite play is a pull-up 
jumper — passing Rice, who shot 
over 50 percent from beyond the 
arc, leading Michigan to the 1989 
National Championship. Though a 
senior, Flaherty has yet to make the 
NCAA Tournament. But the No. 
19 Michigan women’s basketball 
team (6-2 Big Ten, 17-4 overall) is 
well on its way.

And, like they did with Rice, 

opponents are pulling out all 
the stops to keep Flaherty from 
beating 
them, 
face-guarding 

her 25 feet from the basket with 
regularity.

“You got defense working night 

in and night out trying to stop you 
and at the same time, when you’re 
a scorer and you know it’s coming, 
you work that much harder to stay 
ahead of what they’re trying to do 
as far as strategy and stopping you, 
so I feel it,” Rice said. “I understand 
the body of work that she (has). 
She’s put in the work and when you 
put in the work, you accomplish 
what she is accomplishing. It’s 
pretty easy when you’re in that 
spot because you understand 
exactly what you gotta do to keep 
going forward.”

With eight games to go before 

the Big Ten tournament, Flaherty 
is well on her way to setting a 
near-unbreakable scoring mark. 
The only thing left for her to 
accomplish 
in 
her 
collegiate 

career: A tournament run.

‘M’ finishes second

In the face of 2,000 screaming 

fans at the new U-M Indoor 
Track Stadium, fifth-year senior 
Micah Beller came sprinting 
down the stretch of his 3000-
meter race, neck and neck with 
Michigan State’s Clark Ruiz. 
As they neared the finish line, 
Beller narrowly pulled ahead, 
holding his advantage with a 
final lean of his chest over the 
finish line.

“Once it was within 200 

meters, it was just the crowd 
carrying me the whole way,” 
Beller said. “They really got 
into it, and it was awesome 
being able to feed off that 
atmosphere.”

It initially appeared that 

Beller’s 
victory 
gave 
the 

Michigan men’s track and field 
team the advantage it needed 
to hold off Ohio State and take 
home 
the 
Simmons-Harvey 

Quad meet. However, a late 
disqualification in the 4 x 400 
race dropped the Wolverines to 
second place.

Despite the disappointing 

ending, Michigan came away 
from the meet optimistic about 
its all-around showing.

“We performed in almost 

every area,” said Michigan 
coach Jerry Clayton. “Obviously 
the throws and then (junior) 
Taylor (McLaughlin) in the 
400, the 4 x 4 there at the end. 
Overall, from top to bottom, 
very good team effort.”

While Beller’s 3000-meter 

was the most exciting race of 
the day, the Wolverines were 
also dominant in the throwing 
circle. Junior Joseph Ellis and 
senior Grant Cartwright placed 
first and second, respectively, 
in the weight throw, while 
sophomore Andrew Liskowitz 
and Cartwright were the top-
two shot putters.

To contend for a Big Ten title 

next month, these throwers 
— the self-proclaimed ‘Meat 
Factory’ — know they will 
need 
to 
repeat 
Saturday’s 

performances.

“We took that responsibility 

(to be team leaders) on last 
season,” 
Ellis 
said, 
“when 

we scored 30-some points at 
outdoor Big Tens so the team 
is expecting a lot of us but we 
expect a lot of ourselves. Ideally 
the ‘Meat Factory’ — me , Grant, 
Andrew 
Manning 
— 
we’re 

making moves onto the next 
stage at nationals and we start 
to score big points for the team.”

Clayton was equally pleased 

with the performance of his 
throwers.

“The marks at which they 

opened at (were) about exactly 
what 
we 
were 
expecting,” 

Clayton said “so we’re real 
excited with where they’re at.”

Back on the track, Michigan 

saw two personal records in 
the 800-meter race produce 
another 1-2 finish. Junior Matt 
Plowman clocked in at 1:51.83 
while his sophomore teammate 
Anthony Berry ran a 1:52.18 in 
his first collegiate race.

“That was really a big step 

forward, because those guys 
are younger,” Clayton said. “To 
step in and compete against the 
teams we had here, that was 
an outstanding race for both of 
them.”

While the Wolverines were 

pleased with their work on 
the track, perhaps the most 
encouraging performance was 
from the stands. Many of the 
Michigan athletes credited both 
the crowd and their sparkling 
new facilities as supplemental 
to their success.

“I can’t speak enough to 

how this facility has helped us 
(train) over the last couple of 
months,” Beller said.

Even 
the 
throwers 
— 

normally hidden from the fans 
— noticed a difference in the 
crowd.

“It’s kind of nerve-wracking” 

Ellis said. “Normally the throws 
are off to the side and now we’re 
just surrounded by fans.”

Added Clayton: “The crowds 

we’ve had these last two meets 
have just been great. We’re 
excited and we’re glad the fan 
base is too.”

Underclassmen shine in season’s first dual-match 

With the score knotted at 

30-30, 
Chiara 
Lommer 
and 

Alyvia Jones were feeling the 
pressure. If they could just take 
this game, the underclassmen 
would clinch the doubles point 
for the Michigan women’s tennis 
team. If they faltered, the point 
would go to Kansas.

They did not falter.
The No. 2 doubles pair set up 

back-to-back 
unforced 
errors 

to take their match, 7-5. The 
victory was just the beginning of 
Sunday’s dual match, but in the 
end, the Wolverines finished on 
top, 7-1.

Though the ITA Kick-Off is 

not until next weekend, Michigan 
didn’t want to wait to play. By 
starting its season early, it’s just 
one more opportunity for coach 
Ronni Bernstein and the team 
to see what works well and what 
doesn’t.

“We’re trying to figure out a 

way to win the doubles point,” 
Bernstein said. “We’re trying 

to 
find 
someone 
that 
plays 

aggressive with someone that 
sets them up. Today we got (the 
doubles point), which was great, 
but we’ll change it until we feel 
like it’s good.

“But that doubles point is big 

and I think it was a momentum 
thing for us today.”

Some 
may 
think 
that 
a 

freshman and sophomore doubles 
duo is risky, but it clearly paid 
off for the Wolverines. In fact, 
their senior pair at No. 3 doubles, 
made up of Mira Ruder-Hook and 
Kara Hall, was the only team that 
dropped their doubles match.

The underclassmen didn’t just 

shine in doubles, though. The 
first two players off the court 
were Jones and freshman Bella 
Lorenzini, at No. 3 and No. 6 
singles, respectively.

Jumping out to a quick start, 

Jones eventually lost her 2-0 lead 
and the score was tied up again. 
While the first set was a grind for 
the freshman, she took control 
early in the second set. Braced 
with a 5-1 lead, Jones was down 

on points, 40-15. But Jones was 
eager to end her match, forcing 
the game to deuce and winning a 
baseline rally on a Jayhawk error.

While Jones just joined the 

Wolverines at the beginning 
of the winter semester, she has 
already 
proved 
herself. 
She 

earned her way into the doubles 
and singles lineup due to her 
unbeaten record. 

“She’s aggressive, she’s got 

some weapons,” Bernstein said. 
“She’s got a big serve, big forehand, 
she plays defense well, too. I think 
she has it all. … Definitely a big 
addition mid-year.”

While the freshmen breezed 

through 
their 
matches, 
that 

wasn’t 
the 
case 
for 
every 

Michigan player. Normally, when 
a team reaches four points the 
match is over and all matches 
are abandoned, but Ruder-Hook 
and Lommer were given the 
opportunity to play out their third 
sets.

With 
all 
her 
teammates 

watching, Lommer was the last 
on the court. She had a 5-2 lead 

in the final frame, but was down 
on points, 40-30. She fought off a 
game-point to set up deuce. With 
no advantage scoring, this was 
Lommer’s chance to end it.

Kansas was going to make her 

work for it, though.

After a rally of over 30 shots, 

both 
players 
were 
clearly 

exhausted but neither wanted 
to go for the big shot and make 
a mistake. It became a matter 
of who was going to make the 
error first, and in the end, it was 
Jayhawk Janet Koch. Lommer 
won her match, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2.

As fall tennis is all about 

individual play, it was clear that 
the Wolverines were excited to 
get back to being a team. They 
rushed up to Lommer to greet 
her and exhaled as their first dual 
match was in the books.

With ITA Kick-Off on the 

horizon, Michigan’s season is 
just getting started. But with a 
strong veteran force and eager 
underclassmen, the Wolverines 
are poised for another impressive 
season.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Redshirt sophomore Charles Matthews was part of a stagnant Michigan offense that scored just 27 points in the first half.

“Tired” Michigan beats Rutgers, 62-47

Michigan shot 43 percent 

from the field, 32 percent from 
three, made just eight free-
throws and still won by 15 
points Sunday afternoon.

In what may kindly be 

deemed a defensive struggle — 
and not so kindly, a downright 
ugly game — the twenty-third 
ranked Wolverines improved 
to 17-5 overall and 6-3 in Big 
Ten play with a 62-47 win over 
Rutgers.

For much of the first half, 

the Michigan offense seemed 
as disjointed as it was against 
Nebraska earlier this week.

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

the Scarlet Knights’ was worse. 
They scored just .68 points 
per possession in the half, 
including zero made 3-pointers 
and eight turnovers.

Rutgers failed to register an 

assist in the first half, and had 
just one the entire game.

“We were trying to take the 

3-point line away,” said junior 
center Moritz Wagner on his 
team’s defensive strategy. “And 
they have the tendency to go 
to one-on-one plays once you 
take the first play away — at 
least that’s how we scouted. 
Our 
guards, 

especially, did a 
good job.”

But 
the 

Scarlet Knights 
came into the 
game with the 
best 
scoring 

defense 
in 

the 
country 

and 
seemed 

intent 
early 

on 
winning 

with that style. 
Michigan missed 10 of its first 
11 shots, falling to an early 8-2 
deficit.

“Well,” Wagner said, “we’re 

kind of used to it now, right?”

Added 
Beilein: 
“There’s 

some things I can’t explain 
coming out. … Whether it’s 

nerves, whatever it is, they’re 
also reading how the team 
is gonna play us. And when 
they’re going through those 
reads I think it’s giving us some 
paralysis. It’s something that 
we’ve gotta keep working on 
and getting better starts.”

Slowly 
but 
surely, 
the 

Wolverines started to crawl 
out of its now-regular first half 
offensive woes.

Led by a surprising boost of 

energy from fifth-year seniors 
Jaaron Simmons and Duncan 
Robinson, 
Michigan 
pieced 

together an 8-0 run in the 
middle of the first half to grab 
a 15-10 lead.

Regardless of the optics, the 

Wolverines took the lead into 
halftime for the first time since 
Jan. 2 against Iowa. Even with 
bumps in execution, they never 
relingquished that lead.

From there, Rutgers simply 

lacked the offensive firepower 
to force a competitive game. 
While Michigan, as has come to 
be the norm, found its footing 
from beyond the arc in the 
second half, the Scarlet Knights 
struggled to find consistency, 
relying heavily on guard Corey 
Sanders to create in isolation.

Robinson made four of his 

seven 3-point attempts in the 

game, matching 
the number of 
threes he’s had 
in his previous 
five 
games 

combined. 
He 

finished 
with 

12 points on the 
day.

Beilein said he 

knew Robinson 
was due for a big 
game, and sent 
him a text before 

the game saying, “Duncan, 
you’re going to be terrific 
today. Just come off shooting.”

Robinson is shooting just 

37 percent from 3-point-range 
this season, five percentage 
points lower than his previous 
career low. The shooting slump, 

combined with his defensive 
struggles guarding out of his 
normal position, forced him to 
the bench in favor of freshman 
forward Isaiah Livers.

Regardless of role, though, 

Sunday could be a step toward 
Robinson regaining his value.

“That’s the dude I know,” 

Wagner 
said. 
“That’s 
my 

roommate. That’s the player 
I’ve played with the last three 
years, so I’m not surprised at 
all. I’m very proud of him the 
way he bounces back.”

Wagner 
and 
sopohmore 

point guard Zavier Simpson 
also finished in double figures. 
The duo combined for an 
effective 
pick-and-roll 
play 

in the second half to help the 
Wolverines pull away. 

Wagner 
finished 
with 
a 

game-high 16 points, including 
12 in the second half, to guide 
an uninspiring game to a 
merciful finish.

“As you can tell in this 

game, we’re tired. We’re beat,” 
Beilein said.” … “I’m just so 
glad we could gut through this 
game, and get refreshed both 
with our legs but also with our 
game.”

Wolverines plagued by first-half woes

It was as joyous as it was 

ironic.

Halfway through the first 

half of Sunday’s game against 
Rutgers, two Michigan greats 
— 
current 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty from the women’s team 
and former forward Glen Rice 
from the men’s — were being 
honored at Crisler Center as the 
leading scorers in Wolverine 
basketball history.

Shortly 
after, 
the 
men’s 

basketball team jogged to the 
tunnel for halftime after scoring 
its third-lowest first half point 
total of the season, a 27-21 lead. 
The fewest and second-fewest 
totals came in the previous two 
games against Nebraska and 
Maryland.

“We’re kinda used to it now, 

right?” joked junior forward 
Moritz Wagner.

The platitudes and and jests 

don’t do justice to how No. 
23 Michigan has performed 
recently — offense is non-
existent, especially in the first 
half.

After 
upsetting 
No. 
9 

Michigan State on Jan. 13, 
Michigan was averaging 76.7 
points a game. In its following 
three contests, that number 
has dipped to 60.7, largely 
influenced by poor starts.

Sunday, 
of 
course, 

exacerbated this notion. A 1-for-
11 performance to kick off the 
game had coach John Beilein 
burying his face in his palms, 
while assistant coaches Luke 
Yaklich and DeAndre Haynes 
were 
standing 
and 
barking 

orders at their players. An 
eventual 62-47 victory rested 
more in the hands of the Scarlet 
Knights’ ineptitude than the 
Wolverines’ talent.

But, 
like 
Nebraska 
and 

Maryland, 
Rutgers 
was 

capitalizing 
on 
Michigan’s 

predictability.

“Again, 
another 
team 

switched every ball screen — 
most of them — so we’re trying 
to figure it out,” Beilein said. 
“I can’t put my finger on that, 
but hopefully we’ll have better 
starts going forward.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

forward 
Duncan 
Robinson: 

“There’s 
some 
really 
good 

coaches in this league. We gotta 

realize as a team that teams 
aren’t gonna just let us do what 
we wanna do. They’ll take away 
our first, second and sometimes 
our third option. Adjusting 
to that (is needed) and being 
aggressive in different ways 
than our prep.”

The Wolverines have shown 

that they are capable of making 
some of these adjustments in 
the second half. For the past six 
games, Michigan has improved 
upon its first half point totals — 
not necessarily the tallest task 
when field goal percentage has 
hovered in the 30s. Against the 
Scarlet Knights, the Wolverines 
started attacking the hoop with 
higher percentage shots, and 
the results showed — 9-for-14 
from the paint in the final 20 
minutes.

This 
efficiency 
propelled 

Michigan 
over 
Rutgers. 
A 

second-half 
resurrection 
got 

the Wolverines barely over 
the hump versus Maryland. 
But in the 72-52 throttling by 
Nebraska, they couldn’t adapt.

“We just don’t have that sense 

of urgency yet,” said senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. “We lost that game 
in Nebraska, and you’d think 
we’d come out with a little more 
energy. We didn’t. We had a 
pretty good lead at halftime, but 
it’s gotta be better. … We can’t 
sit around and wait for things to 
get better in the second half.”

Not all should be forgotten in 

Michigan’s sluggish first half. 
The long-awaited arrivals of 
Jaaron Simmons being a capable 
ball handler, Jon Teske’s mid-
range jumper and shutdown 
defense by Robinson were all 
welcome sights. As for the rest 
of what happened in the half? 
That’s been a sour taste that isn’t 
getting out of the Wolverines’ 
mouths.

“We’re a better scoring team 

than we were today,” Beilein 
said. “But we’ve gotta get 
through and get some fresh 
legs again so we can make some 
shots.”

“As you can tell 

in this game, 
we’re tired. 
We’re beat.”

‘M’ snags grad transfer DB

The transfer market has 

already 
been 
kind 
to 
the 

Michigan football team.

In one of the most high-

profile 
singings 
of 
Jim 

Harbaugh’s 
tenure, 
former 

Ole Miss quarterback Shea 
Patterson committed to the 
Wolverines 
last 
December. 

Sunday, Michigan tapped that 
market once again.

Utah 
graduate 
transfer 

cornerback Casey Hughes will 
finish his career in Ann Arbor, 
he announced on Twitter.

“It’s a blessing to say that I’ll 

be finishing my last collegiate 
season at the University of 
Michigan,” 
Hughes 
wrote. 

“I want to thank the entire 
Michigan coaching staff for 
believing in me and giving me 
the opportunity to join their 
program.”

During his first year playing 

a major role, Hughes made 
35 tackles and had one pass 
breakup in 11 starts. Last 
September, 
he 
forced 
two 

fumbles 
in 
a 
win 
against 

Arizona.

A native of Las Vegas, Nev., 

Hughes is a former three-
star recruit, according to 247 
Sports. After redshirting the 
2014 season, Hughes served 
predominately on special teams 
as a sophomore and junior.

Though connected by the 

timing of their commitments, 
Hughes and Patterson have 
highly contrasting outlooks for 
2018.

Though his eligibility is 

still undecided, Patterson is 
expected to battle sophomores 
Brandon 
Peters 
and 
Dylan 

McCaffery for the starting job 
under center next fall. Hughes, 
meanwhile, will likely serve as 
a depth piece in the secondary.

Hughes joins a strong and 

deep position group that figures 
to return five corners, including 
incumbent starters Lavert Hill 
and David Long. Three-star 
recruits Gemon Green and 
Sammy Faustin have already 
signed into the Wolverines’ 
class of 2021, while Rochester 
Hills 
native 
Vincent 
Gray 

also announced his Michigan 
intentions Sunday.

Michigan is also pursuing 

offensive 
tackle 
Calvin 

Anderson — a Rice graduate 
transfer also receiving interest 
from Auburn, Texas, TCU, 
Oklahoma 
and 
Pittsburgh. 

With the loss of four-year 
starter Mason Cole, Anderson 
figures to be the biggest target 
on the Wolverines’ remaining 
radar. 
Harbaugh, 
offensive 

coordinator Tim Drevno and 
assistant Sherrone Moore met 
with Anderson last Monday in 
Houston.

But only time will tell if 

Anderson follows Patterson and 
Hughes’ footsteps to Michigan.

Wolverines bounce back with statement win

From the opening minute, the 

No. 8 Michigan wrestling team 
looked untouchable.

Bouncing back in dramatic 

fashion from a demoralizing 
loss against No. 1 Penn State, 
the Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 6-2 
overall) 
trounced 
Wisconsin 

(1-2, 4-2) for an inspiring 29-10 
win.

To 
begin 
the 
meet 
and 

ultimately spell doom for the 
23rd-ranked 
Badgers, 
fifth-

year senior Adam Coon took on 
Wisconsin’s Ben Stone, a match 
that didn’t make it out of the 
first period. Coon muscled his 
way to a first-period fall a mere 
40 seconds into the contest. Cliff 
Keen Arena erupted into a chorus 
of approval as the Wolverines 
began their statement campaign.

“It’s always good to start 

things off like that,” said fifth-
year senior Domenic Abounader. 
“It gets the team going, it gets 
the momentum going and some 
confidence going for our team.”

Michigan 
used 
this 

momentum to its advantage as 
the Wolverines found success 
in the first five matches of the 
night. After these victories, 
including two falls, Michigan 
looked unbeatable.

However, the Badgers did 

have some fight in them as they 
managed to escape with two 
upsets, taking down redshirt 
junior Alec Pantaleo and fifth-
year senior Kevin Beazley. The 
two ranked wrestlers fell to their 
unranked counterparts, 3-0 and 
3-2, respectively.

After losing a close contest 

against 
the 
Nittany 
Lions, 

Michigan needed a big win to 
reaffirm its status as a collegiate 
powerhouse and instill much-
needed confidence.

That is exactly what it got 

as the Wolverines came away 
from the contest winning seven 
out of ten weight classes. This 
confidence was perhaps most 
apparent 
in 
redshirt 
junior 

Malik Amine.

Last week, Amine let his 

emotions get the best of him as he 

was called for three unnecessary 
roughness penalties, essentially 
delivering the match to his 
opponent.

This week was a different 

story. Amine ended the match 
early, pinning Cole Martin in 
the first period. Triumphantly 
emerging form his pin, Amine 
also 
demonstrated 
how 
his 

emotional wrestling style could 
be a positive, strutting across the 
mat and hyping up the crowd.

“After Penn State, I had to 

go back to the drawing board,” 
Amine said. “It’s better to 
wrestle 
emotionally 
for 
me 

then to come out flat. If I go out 
there flat, I lose or I barely win. 
Controlled emotion is probably 
the best for me.”

Going forward, it will take 

consistent control and aggression 
from all the Wolverines to push 
them over the top.

In the two upsets of the meet, 

a glaring lack of aggression 
seemed to be at the root of 
the losses. In his loss, Beazley 
began the first period sluggishly, 
struggling to gain momentum. It 

wasn’t until the third period that 
he showed signs of life before 
ultimately running out of time.

“I think Kevin needs to 

wrestle the first period like 
he did that third period,” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“He wrestles like that — he 
probably wins the match. He’s 
really gotta start stringing moves 
together. It’s a mindset, we talk a 
lot about being aggressive, high 
pace and he finally got that going 
in the third period.”

Growing pains aside, this 

match 
was 
everything 
the 

Wolverines needed it to be. 
Complete with two falls and 
two major decisions, Michigan 
secured the energy needed to 
compete in the Big 10 moving 
forward.

“We didn’t really get a chance 

to 
dominate 
against 
Penn 

State,” Coon said. “So when we 
had the opportunity here in 
those matches where we could 
dominate, we definitely came 
out and put the hurt on them. 
We need to get a couple matches 
where we dominate.”
