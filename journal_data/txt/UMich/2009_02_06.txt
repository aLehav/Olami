Recycling

Cole to t isan politics

As paper market
drops, the financial
benefits from
recycling dwindle
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The fallout from Michigan's
economic troubles have affected
everything from the automotive
to housing industries, and now it
has even reshaped the recycling
market.
Until.a few months ago, the
University did not have to pay to
recycle paper materials. However,
because of the poor economy, the
value of recycled materials has
decreased, leaving the Univer-
sity to foot -the bill for the extra
costs.
The University has a recycling
contract with Fcr, Inc., the private
operator ofAnnArbor's Materials
Recovery Facility, which also col-
lects the University's trash.
Tracy Artley, recycling coordi-
nator for the University, said the
contract includes market-based
pricing for paper recycling.
"When the markets are very
strong and recyclable paper is
worth a lot, the University either
pays less to have it recycled or

realizes an offset in the total
amount of money we have to pay
to have our trash landfilled," Art-
ley said in an e-mail interview.
Artley said the University gen-
erates more trash than recycla-
bles and usually has to pay to have
trash collected and sent to a land-
fill. The University never receives
direct revenue from recycling but
when the paper markets dropped
a few months ago, the University
went from having an offset in its
trash bill to having to pay to recy-
cle paper.
AccordingtoArtley, in October
2008 the Universityearned $37.18
per ton from recycled paper. to
December 2008, it paid $19.48 per
ton to recycle the same material.
While the University received
approximately $7,300 for paper
recycling in October, it still had to
pay $16,500 to landfill its trash -
paying $9,200 altogether.
"Fortunately, the cost of paper
recycling remains cheaper than
the cost of landfilling, so there
continues to be an economic
incentive for the University's stu-
dents, faculty and staff to contin-
ue to recycle," Artley said.
Nancy Stone, Ann Arbor's pub-
lic services spokeswoman, said
the revenue from recyclable sales
always fluctuates, and MRF is
"designed to weather these eco-

Juan Cole, an expert
on the Middle East,.
to discuss Pakistan's
importance tonight
By JOHN A. WEISS, JR.
For the Daily
With a new administration in
Washington, D.C. and a continu-
ing global-war against terrorism,
Pakistan stands at a crossroads as
anascent democracy troubled by its
fledgling state.
Tonight at 7 p.m. in the Ander-

son Room of the Union, Juan Cole,
social historian and professor of
Middle Eastern and South Asian
history at the University, will dis-
cuss the social history of Pakistani
society and its effects on interna-
tional politics.
Cole is a Richard P. Mitchell Col-
legiate Professor of History and is
considered by many to be an expert
on South Asia and more specifically
on Pakistan's transition to democ-
racy.
In an interview, Cole said he
plans to speak about the "winners
and losers" of this change, focus-
ing on the differences between
city dwellers and their agricultural

counterparts.
Over the last few years, Cole said
Pakistan has undergone dramatic
and drastic change. Growth in the
middle class, increased literacy and
access to technology has rapidly
moved Pakistani society away from
its rural and agrarian past, he said.
"About one third of Pakistanis
live on a dollar a day," Cole said.
"Some of the conflict in Pakistan is
rural-urban conflict."
Cole said he is also going to dis-
cuss how social developments are
affecting Pakistani foreign rela-
tions.
Pakistan has been a strong ally
in the war against terror under the

Bush administration, and Cole said
he expects that to continue.But that
relationship has been complicated
over the past few years, as Pakistan
has been rocked by assassination,
scandal and deceit.
"The Obama administration will
see Pakistan as allies, but I think
it will hold the Pakistani politi-
cal class to a higher standard than
Bush did," he said. "Everybody rec-
ognizes that Pakistan might be one
of the single biggest challenges of
the Obama administration so this is
something likely to be on the front
burner for years and will have an
impact on students lives."

New online shop serves needs of
students who are hitting the gym

23 Hour Nutrition to
sell vitamins, weight
M loss aids and energy
supplements
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
On a campus with three gyms,
tight budgets and a foreboding fear
of the freshman 15, two students
have found a way to combat these

problems - and have turned it into
what they hope will be a profitable
business venture.
Last week, LSA senior Eugene
Han and Engineering senior Bran-
don Myers officially launched
23HourNutrition.com, an online
business providing energy supple-
ments, vitamins and weight loss
aids to a workout-hungry student
population.
"We started 23 Hour Nutrition
based on the fact that me and Bran-
-don are gym rats and took supple-
ments to help our workouts," Han

said. "We were frequent customers
of GNC but at the same time real-
ized they were overcharging us by
25- to 50-percent margins."
Han and Myers said they real-
ized they could provide the same
product they could get from any
health store, at a greatly reduced
rate, as long as the company was
based only online.
"We realized that by starting an
online business without having a
storefront retail location, we would
be able to mark down the prices,"

Most fashionistas take their style

thanks to a new website, Stylehop.

the Universitycan starttakingcues

The website allows students
from colleges around the coun-

rank clothing styles to determine
what is most fashionable at their
school.
LSA sophomore Megan Staake,
Stylehop's community manager for
the University, described the web-
site asa "fashion-oriented consum-

social networking features of sites

such as Facebook."
"Just like Amazon is for books,
Stylehop allows its users to rank
clothing," she said.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Geithner plans to
unveil bailout plan
on Monday
TreasurySecretaryTimothyGei-
thner and other top officials are put-
ting the finishing touches on a plan
to overhaul the government's $700
billion financial rescue program.
A Treasury official said Geithner
will deliver a speech on Monday
outlining the new plan.
But Treasury officials would not
comment on a report Yesterday
that the administration is consider-
ing changes to the current account-
ing standard that requires banks
to carry assets such as mortgage-
backed securities on their books
at fair value, a process known as
"mark to market."
Critics 'of this process contend
that it has made the current finan-
cial crisis worse by forcing banks
to slash the value of assets that are
currently depressed because of
market conditions. Treasury offi-
cials said the administration's plan
was not yet complete and would be
revealed in Geithner's speech in
Washington next week. .
The idea of modifying the cur-
rent rules on marking down bank
assets is being considered by some
key lawmakers as a possible way to
address the banking crisis.
BAGDHAD
In provincial vote,
bloc of Iraqi prime
minister wins
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's
allies swept to victory over Shiite
religious parties during last week-
end's provincial elections in Iraq- a
rousing endorsement of his crack-
down on extremists, according to
official results released yesterday.
The impressive showing, which
must be certified by international
and Iraqi observers, places al-Mali-
ki in astrongpositionbefore parlia-
mentary elections late this year and
could bolster U.S. confidence that it
can begin withdrawing more of its
140,000 troops.
The results were a major blow to
Iraq's biggest Shiite religious party
- the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Coun-
cii - which trailed in every Shiite
-provinre including its base in the
holy city of Najaf.
Still, the margin of victory in a
number of Shiite provinces was nar-
row, indicating the prime minister's
supporters will have to cut deals
with their rivals in order to govern.
WASHINGTON
Justice Ginsburg
has cancer surgery
Supreme Court Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg had surgery yester
day for pancreatic cancer, raising
the possibility that one of the ideo-
logically divided court's leading lib-
erals - and its only woman - might
have to curtail herworkorevenstep
down before she had planned.
Ginsburg, 75, has been a justice
since 1993. She has been increas-

ingly vocal in recent years about the
court's more conservative stances,
especially after the appointments
made by President George W. Bush.
Pancreatic cancer is often dead-
ly, although the court said doc-
tors apparently found Ginsburg's
growth at an early stage.
In 1999, she had colon cancer
surgery, underwent radiation and
chemotherapy, and never missed a
day on the bench. Statistics suggest
this could be a tougher fight.
WASHINGTON
Labor pick deals
with spouse's tax
problems
Labor Secretary nominee Hilda
Solis became the latest Cabinet
nominee to face questions about
unpaid taxes Yesterday as a Senate
panel abruptly postponed a sched-
uled vote on her confirmation.
The postponement came after rev-
elations that Solis' husband settled
tax liens on his California auto repair
business this week that had been
outstanding for as long as 16 years.
The discovery posed another
} political headache for a White
House already chafing after tax
problems and other controver-
sies derailed some administration
appointments, including former
Sen. Tom Daschle's nomination as
health secretary. President Barack
Obama pledged in TV interviews

that we're not screwing up again"

"Thetcost of bringing recycla-
bles to the MRP for sorting and
transfer to factories for reuse is
still cheaper than sending the
same tonnage to the landfill to
bury," she said in an e-mail inter-
view.
The decrease in the value of
recyclables coincides with the
University's promotion of recy-
cling through RecycleMania - a
10-week recycling competition
between 513 schools in the United
States, Canada and India.
The contest, which ends Mar.
28, ,challenges schools to produce
the least amount of waste.
Allison Richardson, projectcoor-
dinator for RecycleMania at the
University, said all recyclables from
the University's residence halls and
buildings are loaded into trucks and
are then weighed at the MRP.
"The trucks are weighed sepa-
rately for paper, mixed containers,
trash, and then I take those weights
atthe end ofeveryweekand submit
those," Richardson said.
While the competition encour-

Incident said to have
taken place in a
campus parking lot
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Daily NewsEditor
A 21-year-old man from Detroit
was arraigned yesterday for hit-
ting another man with his car in
a University parking lot Tuesday.
The incident occurred while the
21-year-old man was visiting a Uni-
versity student.
At about 9 p.m. Tuesday, the
University student left her resi-
dence at the Northwood Apart-
ments with the 21-year-old visitor.
They discovered the student's for-
mer boyfriend in a parking lot at
the corner of Murfin Avenue and
Plymouth Road, Department of
Public Safety spokeswoman Diane
Brown said.
Brown said the two men were
involved in a physical fight, after
which the 21-year-old man drove
his car in such a manner that he
hit the student's ex-boyfriend,
who was a 19-year-old visitor from
Plymouth.
The 21-year-old man fled the

scene in his car and was pulled over
by the Ann Arbor Police east of the
parking lot on Plymouth Road,
Brown said. University Police
arrived at the scene and arrested
the man.
The victim was taken to the
University Hospital emergency
room and was evaliated, treated
for non-life-threatening injuries
and then released, Brown said. The
offender was taken to the Washt-
enaw County Jail.
Brown said University Police
submitted their investigation to
the Washtenaw County Prosecu-
tor's office yesterday.
The prosecutor's office autho-
rized three charges: one charge
of assault with intent to murder,
which carries a maximum sen-
tence of life in prison; one charge of
assault with intent to commit great
bodily harm less than murder,
which carries a maximum penalty
of 10 years in prison or a $5,000
fine; and one charge of felonious
assault, which carries a maximum
penalty-of four years in prison or a
$2,000 fine.
The man was arraigned yester-
day afternoon on $100,000 bond,
Brown said. A preliminary exam is'
scheduled for Feb. 18 at 1 p.m.

This is the University's fourth
year participating in the event.

He said he realized that in the
fashion world, women don't have
a place to say what they like and
don't like.
"Fashion is really dictated
by what's happening on the
cat walks, New York, L.A., and
through celebrities," he said.
"There's really no place for
women to say what they like and
don't and that should be a part
that defines fashion."
Reinke said that the goal of the
website is to offer students a place
to get quick information on what
is fashionable in their location.
"It's a fun destination where
women who are interested in
fashion can go to find other
college women interested in
fashion to see what's ranked
fashionable," he said. "It's also
a place where women not so into
fashion can go and don't have to
think about it and quickly see

what's trendy."
Reinke added that the website
offers users the ability to sort
through items based on how pop-
ular they are at a specific location,
instead of by price.
"Wouldn't it be cool if you could
see the topped ranked tank tops
from U of M?" he said. "Not that
you were necessarily going to buy
it, but at least see what's cool."
Right now, the website pri-
marily focuses on party tops but
Reinke said it will be adding cate-
gories like handbags, dresses and
shoes soon.
"Basically what we're trying
to do is bring in the best stuff
and of the best have the college
women decide what's the best
of the best," he said. "We think
that it's going to be fun and
interesting to compare and con-
trast the rankings from different
schools."


DIRECTOR
From Page 1
"Working with a studio you
ultimately have to succumb to the
studio executives who are worried
about how to market the film and
pressure you because of the mil-
lions of dollars they are spending
on your project," he said.
In independent filmmaking, he
said, "you have total creative free-
dom. However, financing a movie
independently is just diabolically
difficult."
A student asked if it was better
to pursue a career in independent
or studio production.
Goldwyn emphatically said,
"Both."
"Pursue everythingyou have the
energy to pursue;" he said: "The
more that you can do, the better off
you are if you want to get into this

business."
He also advised students to take
advantage ofnetworking opportuni-
ties after a student asked him about
how to break into the business.
"Networking, which sounds like
a superficial thing; is actually very
powerful," he said.
Goldwyn said that networking is
not just about talking to someone
to get something out of them, but
rather "it's about connecting on a
creative level, even if it's a business
level."
LSA junior Patrick Crumb, an
English major interested in screen
writing, said he was able to take
away a lot of information from
Goldwyn's talk.
"I came out here because I just
think it's a really cool opportunity
we have and it's interesting to see
what's -happening in Michigan-in

Ahmed Zaidi, the presi-
dent of the Pakistani Stu-
dents' Association, which is
hosting the event, said the
goal of the lecture is to cre-
ate awareness about Pakistan
for the benefit of the campus
community and the larger
Ann Arbor area.
"We hope that by hav-
ing lectures and discussions
like these we can achieve our
goal of dispelling misconcep-
tions and raising awareness
about the political system and
Pakistani society's problems,"
Zaidi said in an e-mail inter-
view.
Zaidi added that it is impor-
tant for students to see an
unbiased and personal view
of Pakistan, noting that while
the group primarily serves
Pakistanis, all can benefit from
knowledge about the country
and region.
"For members of the audi-
ence not directly associated
with the country, I hope this
serves as a learning experi-
ence, one that will instill in
them a more personal and
understanding view of Paki-
stan's and Pakistanis' prob-
lems and replace a reliance on
stereotypes and preconceived
notions," he said.

we know what is popular and what
works for us. We look at different
people and their goals," Myers
said. "We carryproducts based on
their goals and different products
for different goals."
Based on the orders they have
already received, Myers and Han
project that the protein and Cre-
atine supplements they sell will
be their most popular products.
But as the business becomes
more popular and the number
of orders increases, they plan to
stockpile more popular items,
which will also help to lower
their costs.
They are currently market-
ing toward athletic groups, clubs,
Intramural sports and Greek life.
Ultimately, they said they plan to
expand to professors, graduate
student instructors and then other
locations.
At present the two seniors have
a promotion plan with students in
the Greek community, offering a
$5 coupon on their website.
"We are running a rewards pro-
gram fortheGreek system," Myers
said. "If someone from a fraternity
or sorority purchases products,

they can put in their fraternity or
sorority's rewards code. We are
runningthis up until spring break,
and-after springbreakwe-will give"
them a check based on the amount
they have spent."
To keep their prices lower than
any other major retailer, Myers
and Han get their products from
five different distributors.
The pair also employs some
drivers to ensure deliveries are
made on time. As they expand,
they said delivering within their
guaranteed timeframe will be
impossible without additional
drivers taking their products to
their varied destinations.
Once 23 Hour Nutrition starts
profiting from its sales, Myers
and Han said they plan to expand
the distance to which they mar-
ket their products and influence
the nutrition supplement indus-
try.
"We are looking to expand to
EMU and MSU," Han said. "We
feel like this is the future of vita-
min shops across the country. We
do everything as efficiently as
possible and hope our name will
be out there in the future."

The 'U' unplugged
Increased security and wireless access equally important
lthough the University has established itself as a leader in
cutting-edge research and technology, there is still one basic
technology it doesn't deliver: complete wireless Internet
capabilities. Knowing this, it is bewildering to learn that University
officials have recently chosen to develop a new security system for
its wireless network without prioritizing basic, campus-wide Inter-
net access. While it is certainly important that the University keep
its online community safe, the University must also accelerate its
efforts to establish a universal wireless network so that all of its stu-
dents and faculty are able to connect at any place on campus.

NOTABLE QOAL
If this is the change we all can believe in,
America's best days are behind her"

proposed by President Obama, as reported yesterday by CNN.

Preventing another Katria

As it stands, the existing wireless network
is outdated and lacking in security. With
the old UM Wireless, users' data was not
necessarily secure unless they were using
a secure application to protect data or were
consciously visiting only secure websites. To
tighten security, Information Technology
Central Services is now providing wireless
coverage with the new MWireless network.
After downloading and installing MWire-
less software, wireless users will be linked
to the University's. safest wireless network.
MWireless uses a new, more sophisticated
encryption system to protect users' data.
And while ITCS is rightly fulfilling a
responsibility to improve Internet security,
it should simultaneously focus on increas-
ing the reach of campus wireless Internet.
Universities nationwide are enabling wire-
less access that span across entire campuses.
The University of Minnesota, University of
California at San Diego and even the much
older Dartmouth University are among the
colleges that have managed to provide full
coverage of their campuses both indoors and
outdoors. Even Ann Arbor's friendly neigh-
bor, Ypsilanti, has started a massive effort to
blanket the region with broadband access.
Yet, here in Ann Arbor, students are still
struggling to get a signal.
Baits Residence Hall residents, who have
no wireless connection, have felt the absence.
Even students living in Central Campus resi-
dence halls like West Quad and East Quad
can't get wireless unless they are in a desig-

nated wireless lounge. It's even more annoy-
ing that getting a strong wireless signal in
buildings that are supposed to have wireless,
like the Dennison Building or the stacks of
the Hatcher Graduate Library, is sometimes
nothing more than a fantasy. In a world
where Internet access is becoming increas-
ingly important in education, it's unaccept-
able that so many students don't have access
unless they're plugged into the wall. And, in
classrooms where wireless access is unreli-
able or nonexistent, students don't even have
that option.
The University argues it hasn't updated
access faster because it costs hundreds of
thousands of dollars to equip even a single
dorm hallway with wireless access. And, to
be fair, wireless access has been added to
many buildings that have undergone renova-
tion. That makes sense, but the University's
other rationalization doesn't. It argues that
the popularity of wireless and 3G phones
- which operateon their own networks -
have caused the demand for wireless access
to decrease. Currently, however, only about
a quarter of University students have such a
device. Besides, Internet access shouldn't be
limited to only economically advantaged stu-
dents who can afford the fanciest gadgets.
Hopefully, one day campus will promise
safe and widespread wireless access. But
for now, the best bet for gaining instant
wireless access in the comfort of an East
Quad dorm room may be to fork over $200
for a BlackBerry.

The storm left thousands dead
and tens of thousands more
homeless. An entire region was
flooded. Massive
damage spanned
hundreds of square
miles. In the storm's
wake, the nation
vowed that this
would never hap-
pen again. Within -
days, a government
initiative marked
the design of the BEN
largest flood control CALECA
project in modern
history.
That sounds
very rational, even responsible, so it's
no wonder this wasn't the U.S. This
nation was the Netherlands. Politi-
cians in our own country need to stop
shuffling their feet and approve proj-
ects that will protect not just people,
but also homes and the economy from
the risks of major storms.
This past Saturday marked the 56th
anniversary of the 1953 North Sea
Flood, which killed thousands across
several European countries including
the Netherlands, Great Britain and
Belgium. These countries responded
efficiently by constructing systems
like the Deltaworks in the Nether-
lands. Floodgates, levees and dams
encircle much of the country's coasts
and harbors, protecting them from
flooding. One navigable channel over
a thousand feet wide can be complete-
ly sealed by a movable barrier that is
among the largest moving structures
ever built. The Deltaworks, which
dwarfs the New Orleans system, can
prevent damages from storms far larg-
er than the 1953 storm.
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina's
disastrous effects, it is embarrassingly
stupid thatthe federal governmenthas
not invested in a proper flood protec-
tion plan for vulnerable areas of the

Gulf coast. The cost of the Deltaworks
project over the span of fifty years
of construction totaled less than 10
percent of the cost of damages from.
Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi.
While the costs to maintain such an
ambitious system are very great for
the Netherlands, much of these costs
go back into the economy in the form
of jobs for engineers, contractors and
technicians whose livelihoods are
based on the Deltaworks.
So what is really being done to pre-
vent a future disaster like Katrina?
The levee system proposed early last
year by the Army Corps of Engineers
is estimated to take over three decades
to build and will cost about $9 billion.
This system would be built to a 100-
year storm standard, which means it
protects Louisiana from storms that
occur only around once in a hundred
years. Compare this to the Delta-
works, which is built at 250 to 1,250-
year storm standards, and you get an
idea of how much more can be done for
the Gulf states.
But this project's price, which is
merely a fraction of the estimated $150
billion in damages to the economy
caused by Hurricane Katrina, is con-
sidered too high for many legislators.
The corps is expected to recommend
an even weaker levee system, similar
to those proposed before Hurricane
Katrina hit, that would only stand
up to a 25-year storm standard. At a
reduced cost compared to the current
proposal, this levee would not even
provide enough protection to guaran-
tee that all Louisiana citizens would
be able to buy federal flood insurance
without raising the elevation of their
homes at great cost. Such a proposal
is stunningly insulting to those whose
property - and families - were dam-
aged or destroyed by the disaster.
While the situation in New Orleans
isn't the same as the Netherlands,
significant resources are required to

protect the city. The civil infrastruc-
ture funds that are part of the most
current iteration of the stimulus bill in
Congress seem like an obvious source
of funds. But, as it turns out, the obvi-
ous just isn't so obvious to legislators.
A relatively paltry sum of $4.5 billion
was allocated to the Army Corps of
Engineers for a number of respon-
sibilities nationwide, of which flood
control is only one.
The U.S. needs to
take a lesson in
flood protection.
Some ,Republicans have proposed
that funds be thrown at the corps for
more extensive projects, but perhaps
legislators should look at who else
is equipped to handle New Orleans'
challenge. Other groups like the Loui-
siana State Office of Coastal Protec-
tion and Restoration claim they can
undercut the corps by a significant
amount.Congressneeds to lookatwho
is best equipped touse federal funds to
save lives and protect cities like New
Orleans from major storms.
While it's been over three years
since Hurricane Katrina ravaged the
Gulf coast, progress toward an accept-
able flood control systemfor the region
is still lagging. The Netherlands'
response to its own natural disaster is
a perfect example of how our nation
should approach this problem. If the
federal government is committed to
protecting the lives of people living
in the Gulf region, it cannot cheap out
and sit on its hands when it comes to
protecting citizens.

VALERIE BIEBERICH AND CHOONBOON TAN I VIEWPOINT
A look at the stimulus bill

Getting away with murder

During these difficult economic times across
the country and in Michigan, much attention
has been paid to the economic stimulus pack-
age currently making its way through Con-
gress. The House version of the bill, labeled
H.R. 1, was passed last week and is currently
before the Senate. The package spends in three
distinct ways: government purchases of goods
and services, direct, payments to individuals
(for example, through welfare programs) and
tax relief. The Congressional Budget Office
estimates that the bill in its current form will
increase the federal budget deficit by about
$816 billion over the next ten years. Yet, even
with the high cost, it is essential that the bill
be passed swiftly to create jobs and boost con-
sumer confidence.
The government will use $365.6 billion of the
stimulus funds to rebuild highways and roads,
increase funding for education, perform pub-
lic facilities maintenance and invest in energy.
This form of spending will be the most direct
way to revive the economy because it has the
capacity to create millions of jobs. With unem-
ployment increasing every month, it is crucial
for the federal government to keep as many
people as possible on the payroll. And while
some worry that this type of spending will not
impact the economy as quickly as is needed, it is
the only way to ensure that government money
gets to the desired ends - namely, creating jobs
and investing in the country's future. Addition-
ally, part of this fund will be allocated to the
green energy sector. This will help to reduce
the nation's reliance on foreign oil, environ-
mental pollution associated with crude oil and
possible inflation risks in the future.
The second major portion of the stimulus
money, consisting of about $180 billion, will
seek to offer jobless benefits, Medicaid, supple-
mentalnutritionassistance, socialsecurityben-
efits and other programs that transfer money
directly to qualified citizens. This spending can
undoubtedly help to buffer many of the prob-
lems that people on Main Street face and help

them withstand these difficult times, but this
policy may not be effective. This spending will
not help create any new jobs and is not aimed
at fixing the sources of the country's economic
problems, but this money needs to be infused
into the society in order to temporarily allevi-
ate the crisis.
And lastly, the plan includes $275 billion
in tax relief. Last year, the Bush administra-
tion tried to implement a similar tax cut - the
Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. But its efforts
were unsuccessful in resurrecting the econo-
my. Instead of spending their share, most peo-
ple who received the tax relief ended up saving
a huge portion of this additional income. This
year will be no different. Most Americans will
choose to save in preparation for worse times
to come, and savings will not provide the vital
boost that the economy so sorely needs. And
while this relief unquestionably helps those
who really need it to pay the current month's
bills, but what about next month's? We need a
solution that can solve our problems without
simply delaying them.
In the end, raising consumer confidence is
essential to help the nation pull itself out of
this crisis. When consumer confidence goes up,
so does consumer spending, which accounts
for two-thirds of the country's gross domestic
product. Additionally, when the public con-
sumes more goods, businesses start to stock up
their inventories and increase spending once
more. With greater confidence in the economy,
financial markets begin to unfreeze lending,
which increases liquidity for investments and
business operations.
No bill is perfect, and the stimulus package is
no exception. But even though H.R. 1 is flawed
in a few ways, it is necessary that policymakers
work together and pass this bill quickly to start
the country's economic recovery..

n New Year's Day in Oakland,
California, an unarmed black
man named Oscar Grant was
shot by a white
police officer. The
bullet went through
his back, rebounded
off the pavement,
pierced his lung and
took his life.
As a black man
who has been
harassed, thrown
up against a wall MATTHEW
and called racial HUNTER
slurs by white cops
in Michigan, I was
frustrated. When
I saw the video on KTVU, a local TV
station in Oakland, I played it over
many times. I thought that if I played
it enough, I would somehow erase it
horrible memory; maybe I couldunder-
stand it better or find a rationale for
the officer's actions. I thought that if I
researched enough maybe I could dis-
cover what crime Grant was suspected
of committing that could warrant such
a response. But as I watched and read
the reports, the social realities of the
event became glaringly clear.
As people were returning from vari-
ous festivities on Oakland's Bay Area
Rapid Transit subway, one bystander
opened his cell phone to record an
escalating conflict. BART police offi-
cers were investigating a report of a
fight nearby. The recording shows
three police officers surrounding men
against a wall. Grant appears, to be
making an innocent plea on his knees.
Other bystanders seem to be silent.
Grant was then forced to lie on his
stomach by the police. One police offi-
cer stands, draws his gun, and shoots
him in the back.
Grant was unarmed, but the offi-
cer contends that he was reaching for
a weapon. Grant did not appear to be
struggling at all, but if he did reach
for a gun, it would have been justifi-

able grounds to use force. The offi-
cer also claims that he meant to use
a taser instead of a gun, but the truth
to this claim is questionable. He has
been charged with first degree murder
and is the first California officer to be
charged with murder in decades.
It's no secret that African-Ameri-
cans' sentiments about cops are often
negative. A 2007 report to the United
Nations titled "Persistent Police Bru-
tality and Abuse of People of Color in
the United States" documented the dis-
proportionate effect of racial profiling
and police brutality toward African-
Americans. A 1999 study by The New
York Times reported that 57 percent of
blacks said they did not feel safer in the
presence of a police officer, while 62
percent of whites said they did. There
is a reason that African-Americans
'get extra-fidgety at the site of a Chevy
Impala or blinking lights. The particu-
lar response of African-Americans to
police is more directly related to a long
history of racism and police brutality..
Anyone around of a television set
during Black History month may at
some point come across the images we
have seen so many times before: police
and their canines belligerently attack-
ing black men, women and children:
This footage largely comes from the
1960s - a time that was plagued with
salient racism and brutality against
blacks. In what is being heralded as the
"post-racial" era, it is easy to surrender
to historical amnesia,toviewracialtol-
erance as on the rise and to pronounce
our black president as the pinnacle of
the black civil rights struggle. But rac-
ism still exists today. And it seems that
racism's relationship with police bru-
tality has been relentless.
In 1991, four policemen used exces-
sive force against Rodney King and the
1992 Los Angeles riots ensued after the
police were acquitted. In 1999, in New
York City, Amadou Diallo was killed
after four policemen shot at him 41
times - all four were acquitted. On the

morning of Sean Bell's wedding day in
2006, the police shot and killed him in
Queens - they went to trial and were
found not guilty. In 2006, in an occa-
sion closer to home, Clifton Lee Jr.
was horrendously beaten by police in
Ypsilanti Township and then died. In
all cases, the victims were unarmed.
Questions of racism that lack obvious
answers persist.

Examining police
brutality in the
"post-racial" era.

I

This year's remarkable inaugura-
tion sharply contrasted Oscar Grant's
death. The American mass media has
celebrated civil rights progress in the
U.S. on account of Obama's presidency,
yet the Grant incident is comparative-
ly inconspicuous. Is this an accident?
Are we numbed by negative racial
issues to where news media no longer
finds police brutality interesting? Are
we worried that police brutality and
its consistent correlation with racism
will challenge the supposed "post-
racial" era?
Hopefully, this case will contradict
history and the officer will be con-
victed - this time, it's only one cop.
But his conviction does not ensure
proper racial sensitivity training, and
such training is crucial during a time
where racialized issues are considered
less prevalent. After all the progress
thus far, it would be a shame to brush
this one under the carpet just because
Obama is now president. We all want
to finally become part of the "post-
racial era", but ignoring racism's exis-
tence fails to accomplish this goal.

"Darkness Falls"), heraiter and
confidante Alex (Arielle Kebbel,
"Be Cool"):and their haunting (and
oftentimes metaphysical) relation-
ghip-with their stepmother Rachael
(Elizabeth Banks, "W.").
overwroughtthematicmaterial,
poor acting and an unconvincing
narrative mar whatever potential
value this film might have had. By
the story's end, the film seems to
be desperately trying to reconcile
the holes and inconsistencies in its

Showtime shows and prove that
it has staying power. The cable
channel is known to explore the
lives of unconventional fam-
ily units - the Fisher family who
owned a funeral home in "Six
Feet Under" and the pot-dealing
Botwin clan of "Weeds" are far
cries from normal. But "United
States of Tara" now has to face
the challenge of maintaining its
offbeat concept while not going
off the deep end and alienating its
audience - a challenge that both
"Weeds" and "Six Feet Under"
struggled with as they progressed
into later seasons.
Though it's too early to deter-
mine if "United States of Tara" is
a work of television genius, the
initial showing's approach is dif-
ferent from virtually any other
family-centered show on televi-
sion. With the help of a winning
trifecta - executive producer Ste-
ven Spielberg, writer Diablo Cody
("Juno") and lead actress Toni
Collette - the show looks likes it
could be a success. "United States
of Tara" can't rely too much on its
prestigious creative team and lead
actors,however, because its success
hinges upon its actual execution -
something that, for this show, will
be three times as difficult.
plot rather than offer its viewer a
unique and engaging experience.
The unintentionally humorous plot
twist, which is oddly reminiscent
of "Fight Ciub," could inciteovew-
ers to scan the production credits
for the name M. Night Shyamalan.
It's worth noting that the movie
contains sufficient- scares and
thrills to satisfy the most gracious
enthusiasts of generic thrillers.
But those expecting a film with
cerebral acting roles and a well-
written script may very well be
demanding a refund before the
movie's conclusion.

Don'twant to be
a Bummer in the Summer?

By ALEX PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
Atop redshirt senior C.J. Lee's
locker was a note: "Ondefense you
must guard like..." A black Adidas
football glove was taped to it.
"One of our assistant coaches
put it up there,
and I told him
I definitely got
the message,"
Lee said. "That
was the empha-
sis for tonight -
defense and locking
up, just strapping down
on defense. And that's what
we did."
Lee played a career-high 29
minutes and held sophomore
guard Talor Battle, the Big Ten's
leading scorer, to just nine
points in Michigan's crucial
71-51 victory over Penn State
last night at Crisler Arena.
"Great defense," Michigan
coach John Beilein said. "Best
we've played all year." .
Sophomore Manny Harris led
Michigan in scoring for the 13th
time this season, racking up 28
points, 19 in the second half.
He also collected seven assists
and six rebounds. Freshman
Stu Douglass added 13 points on
3-of-7 shooting from behind the
arc.
The win was a perfect gift to
Beilein on his 56th birthday.
Michigan (5-6 Big Ten, 15-8
overall) needed to win last night's
game more than any other this
season. Coming in, the Wolver-
ines had lost five of their last six
games. In the next five days, they
face No. 1 Connecticut and No. 13

Michigan State. And like Penn
State, the Wolverines are in the
hunt for an NCAA Tournament
bid.
So Beilein went a little out of
his comfort zone to make sure
his team understood the circum-
stances.
"I told the guys yesterday, I
haven't gone to one game this
year and said, 'Hey guys, this
is an important game,"' Beilein

said. "And I don't know if I would
have told (the media) this if we
had lost, but we really thought
this was an important game."
Even administrative specialist
Jeff Meyer did his best to moti-
vate the team.
Both Wednesday and Thursday,
he sent text messages reminding
players that according to ESPN's
Bracketology, which predicts the
NCAA Tournament bracket, Penn
State (6-4, 17-6) was pegged as
one of the "Last four in" and
Michigan was one of the "Next
four out."
A change in the start-

ing lineup - one that emphasized
defense- alsoindicated the
game's importance.
Beilein started redshirt junior
Zack Gibson in place of the team's
second-leading scorer DeShawn
Sims and Lee instead of sopho-
more Kelvin Grady, who played
just one minute last night after
starting the last eight games.
Neither Grady nor Beilein
said there was an off-court rea-
son for the reduction in his play-
ing time.
"We were trying to get a little
more defensive to start," Beilein
said. "I just felt that mixing it up
a little bit would be a better way
to attack them tonight."
But at halftime, the game was
still up in the air. Despite play-
ing superb defense, Michigan
scored just 29 points in the first
half and trailed by two at the
break.
During halftime, Beilein
gave a positive talk to instill
confidence on the offensive
end.
"It sparked us," Harris said.
"From the beginning of the sec-
ond half, the spark was there."
Michigan outscored Penn State
42-20 in the final 20 minutes
behind 64-percent shooting from
the field.
It was the first time the Wol-
verines shot over 50 percent in
a half since their Jan. 11 win at
Iowa.
Though Michigan got the win
it badly needed, it has no time to
celebrate.
Next on tap is No, 1 Connecti-
cut tomorrow evening in Storrs,
Conn. The Wolverines are 1-18 all-
time against first-ranked teams.

CIF REEDER/Daily
Junior DeShawn Sims puts in a layup over a Penn State defender in the 71-51 win.

Grady's locker room shenanigans are a good
sign for Michigan down the stretch

After last night's game,
various members of
the media rushed into
the Michigan men's basketball
team locker room, surrounding
star players like Manny Harris,
DeShawn Sims and Zack Novak.
There was, however, one
"exclusive" interview.
"Last ques-
tion," sopho-
more Kelvin
Grady said,
in his most r
professional-
sounding
voice, to fifth-_
year senior ANDY
David Mer- REID
ritt. "David, --
could you tell
us about your recent facial hair
change? It looks like you've got a
little chinstrap thing going on."
Grady shoved the maize-
and-blue microphone used for
Mgoblue.com's multimedia
reporters in Merritt's face for a
reply.
Merritt took the joke in stride,
stroking his goatee for the
camera as people stopped and

laughed at the spectacle.
"(Grady's) just a silly kid,"
Harris said, shaking his head
and smiling on his way out of the
locker room.
The players haven't had that
much fun in a in a postgame
locker room in a long time, but
a 20-point win over a team that
destroyed you two weeks ago will
do that.
From here on out, it needs to
be the whole team's attitude if it
wants to be dancing in March.
The Wolverines can't afford to
take themselves too seriously,
especially in the next four days,
because when they get worked
up, they shut down.
After Michigan lost to Duke
in Madison Square Garden, Ohio
State at home and Purdue on the
road, Grady sat quietly by his
locker, waiting for the media to
leave as he softly and abruptly
answered the few questions he
was asked.
When the losses built up, the
team struggled to shake it off and
play like it proved it could earlier
in the season.
Just look at the Wolverines' 1-5

skid before last night's win ten-
sions were high, answers were
few and even a couple elbows
were thrown. Michigan has been
grasping at straws over the last
month to figure out a way to end
its potentially season-crippling
slump.
Maybe the team was waiting
for this win over a red-hot Penn
State team. And if that's true,
Grady's mood - despite the fact
that he only played in garbage
time - is just what the team
needed.
The Wolverines simply
wouldn't have had time to sit and
dwell on a now-hypothetical loss
to Penn State.
They play Connecticut, the No.
1 team in the nation, in Storrs,.
Conn., tomorrow.
They have just two days after
that to prepare for their lone
game of the year against archri-
val Michigan State.
Then, they have to finish the
Big Ten regular season strong
just to keep their precarious posi-
tion on the NCAA Tournament
bubble.
A loss last night would have

not only given no momentum
going into the next four days, but
would have also ended any real-
istic chance of an NCAA Tourna-
ment bid.
It's just one win, and with four
to five more conference victories
still necessary before Michigan
fans can buy tickets to the closest
NCAA Regional, I don't want to
put too much emphasis on it.
Or maybe a decisive win like
this could be just what a program
that's been in hibernation for the
last 10 years needs, especially
with arguably the Wolverines'
two biggest games of the season
on deck.
The team knows it - Novak
called the second stanza "the big-
gest half we've played all year" in
terms of importance.
This afternoon, the Wolverines
will board a plane for Connecti-
cut with a newfound bounce in
their collective step.
It couldn't have come at a more
perfect time.

Hogan excels oim pa
anecesas his own toughest cr1ii.LcAT

By GJON JUNCAJ
Daily Sports Writer
If you walked into a Michigan
hockey practice having never met
sophomore goalie Bryan Hogan,
youmightleave the rinkthinkinghe
was a little too hard on himself.
"Youwould thinkit's pretty obnox-
ious," sophomore forward Matt Rust
said."You'd maybe

16-3 record with a Live Blog:

1.92 goals-agamst blogs.michi-
average, which is gandaily.com
eighth best in the
country.
Hogan, a Highland Township
native, is notorious for his flaring
temper after someone scores on him
in practice. His cursing reverberates
off the walls of Yost Ice Arena, and
any teammate who fires a shot past
him can expectapuck or stick flying
back in their direction.
The act of frustration is one of
Hogan's trademarks - both senior
goalie Billy Sauer and sophomore
Shawn Hunwick are much more
even-keeled during practice, regard-
less of the number of goals they give
up. And as strange (and entertain-
ing) as it may be to see Hogan lose
his bearings during shootout drills,
the coaching staff sees no problem
with players using practice to vent.
"I've seen goalies before get upset
like that," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "And they get upset
with themselves. ... They appear
mad at the player, but they're just
mad at themselves. So I like that
rather than a player who doesn't
seem to care."
The mood swings during practice
give Hogan's teammates endless
ammunition for teasing. But don't
expect to see Hogan unravel during

first time since Dec. 19.
Senior forward Carly Benson,
who has fallen victim to a scor-
ing slump during the conference
season, tried to take the game into
her own hands as the Wolverines
were down four with four min-
utes remaining. She scored five
straight points, including a clutch
3-pointer, to pull the Wolverines
within one.
But leading Northwestern scor-
er Amy Jaeschke, a 65-percent
free-throw shooter on the sea-
son, netted two from the charity
stripe to push the Wildcats' lead
to three.
After two more Northwestern

free throws, Minnfield fired up a
long-distance 3-pointer that fell
short, leaving Hicks to tear the
rebound out of her opponent's
hands and draw a foul.
With 10 seconds remaining, the
Wolverines were down just three
points and junior center Krista
Phillips was left with an open shot
from behind the arc to send the
game into overtime.
"We all thought it was going
in," Hicks said.
But it rimmed out, along with
the Wolverines' chances of finish-
ing above .500 in Big Ten confer-
ence play.
"It's clearly agame we should've
and could've won," Hicks said
of her homecoming. "No matter
where we are, no matter where I
am, a loss is the same."

'M' Note: Six gymnasts
reach Winter Cup finals

SAID ALSALAH/Dai
Sophomore Bryan Hogan stops a Miami (Ohio) shot in the Wolverines weekend sweep oftthe RedHawks almost a month ago.

this weekend's series between No. 4
Michigan (13-7 CCHA, 19-9 overall)
and Lake Superior State (6-8-6-1,
9-11-8). He has an emotional switch
he can turn on or off on cue.
"(Hogan) told me that, and I
didn't believe him," goaltending
coach Josh Blackburn said. "But he
seems to handle it pretty good in
games. I expected maybe a busted
stick or something like that in the
beginning of the year."
Given Hogan's unique practice
reputation and this season's cir-
cumstances, it is that much more
surprising how easily he can keep
his emotions in check. Hogan and
Sauer were involved a well-publi-
cized starting goalie competition
during the first half of the season.
Though their statistics mirrored
each other's, Hogan received far
better offensive support than Sauer
- 4.26 goals per game for Hogan,
compared to just 1.28 for Sauer -
and won the starting job.
It's been an incredibly pressure-

packed year for Hogan. This is his
first season as a full-time starter,
and he's playing the sport's most
scrutinized position at a premier
national collegiate power.
Plus, Sauer isn't a second-string
netminder. The Walworth, New
York native is prominently featured
in Michigan's record book: he ranks
in the top five in career wins, shut-
outs, goals-against average and save
percentage.
So while Hogan has established
himself as the Wolverines' starting
goalie, each game is treated like a
60-minute audition for the job.
"Hogan's alwaysbeen a hothead,"
Rust said, smiling. "He always will
be a hothead. I don't think he's any
looser. Although he is our No.I right
now, Billy is a skilled, top-flight
goalie. I don't think you can let up
for one second. His spot is not set in
stone."
Hogan appears uneasy at times
when discussing his individual suc-
cess. He hates discussing winning

and shutout streaks and is always
quick to credit his defensemen for
makinggames easy.
Though Hogan needs to maintain
a high stress level to stay on edge
and sharpen his focus, coaches and
teammates acknowledge that he
might be best served cutting back
on his outbursts.
"We're trying to get him to calm
down a little bit, so the boys don't
give him such a hard time," Black-
burn said with a laugh.
Blackburn took on the role of
Hogan's makeshift, on-ice therapist
this season. IHe may, by all accounts,
be a little calmer than last year,
but there's still plenty of room for
improvement.
"(Blackburn) just says funny
things when I'm getting mad out
in practice and tries to lighten the
mood a littlebit," Hogan said. "Does
it help? I don't know. I don't think
so. He just does it anyway. But it's
funny. It's gotten a lot better over
last year with that situation."

Sophomore Chris Cameron finished second on the parallel bars yesterday.

In his first Winter Cup as a col-
lege gymnast, Michigan sopho-
more Chris Cameron led a group of
eight Wolverines in Las Vegas.
Cameron, sophomore Thomas
Kelley, senior Ralph Rosso and
alumnusEddieUmphreycompeted
in the evening session, usually the
higher scoring of the Winter Cup's
two preliminaries. Cameron won
the still rings for his session with a
score of 14.90, coming in second on
the parallel bars (14.75) and sixth
on the floor (14.70). Rosso placed
fourth on the rings (14.50) and
sixth on parallel bars in the session
(14.30), with Kelley tying for fifth

on the high bar (14.35).
Intheearlier preliminary,junior
Mel Santander tied for second on
the pommel horse (14.75), with
fifth-year senior Paul Woodward
in fourth (14.40). Senior co-captain
Phil Goldberg tied for seventh on
the still rings (14.55).
The top 42 gymnasts advance
to Saturday's finals on the basis
of a descending point system - a
first-place finish earns 30 points,
down to a 30th-place finish which
earns one point. Cameron, Gold-
berg, Kelley, Rosso, Santander and
Woodward will all compete for
spots onthe national team.
