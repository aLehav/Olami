TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
Engineering junior Joey Juanico speaks to a group of protestors in front of City Hall on Friday. The protest was meant to push city officials - who had previously sent let-
ters to BOX House and other residences on State Street - to stop trying to prevent tailgates on Football Saturdays.

If proposal passes,
same-room and
same-hall policy will
be discontinued
BySTEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
A perfect storm of residence hall
closings, learning community obli-
gations and room shortages have
led officials in University Housing
to seriously consider changing the
residence hall sign-up process for
next year.
Under the proposed policy, stu-
dents would no longer have the
option to apply for the same room
or a room in the same residence
hall in which they currently reside.
Instead, all students would be
placed in a campus-wide lottery.
Housingspokesman Peter Logan
said the proposed change is the
result of an anticipated shortage of
2,200 rooms that will not be avail-
able to returning students inter-
ested in living in the same room or
residence hall.
Logan said the combination of
residence halls that will either be
closed for construction, open to
only first- or second-year students
or reserved for learning communi-
ties next year makes it impossible
to figure out a fair sign-up process
in which students can choose the
rooms they want.
"For that reason, we thought it's
probably going to be more equitable
for most resident students to simply
offer from the start the campus-
wide sign-up step and forgo the
same hall, same room steps that
proceeded it," he said.
Part of the complication results

from the fact that starting next fall,
Couzens Residence Hall will be
closed for renovation. As a result,
approximately 550 fewer rooms
willbe available.
About 120 students in the Michi-
gan Community Scholars Program
and 60 students in the Honors
Program - who currently reside
in Couzens - will be relocated to
other residence halls..Honors stu-
dents will move to South Quad, but
it is not yet confirmed where MCSP
students will be housed.
ThoughNorthQuadwillbeopen-
ing next fall, Logan said it won't
solve the room deficiency. The new
hall will have approximately 450
rooms, but the University will still
lack 100 rooms after losing the 550
spaces in Couzens.
While Logan could not confirm
where students from MCSP will be
placed, he said they will not be put
in North Quad.
Additionally, all of Mary Mar-
kley Residence Hall and three
houses in Baits II will be reserved
for first-year students as part of the
First-Year Experience Program.
This makes approximately 1,495
spaces unavailable for upperclass-
men. In the past, upperclassmen
could apply to live in Markley or
any house in Baits, but with the
freshmen programs, they can no
longer do that.
While Stockwell Residence Hall
is set aside for returning students,
the residence hall concentrates on
its Sophomore Year Experience
Program. Logan said this poses
a problem for sophomores cur-
rently residing in Stockwell who
may want to live there again next
year. He said Housing may allow
some current residents to return
to Stockwell next year, but it has

CAMPUS SAFETY
New DPS program
targets laptop theft

HIGH HOPES

THE METROPOLIS NEXT DOOR
With grant, debate
group could further
help Detroit students

Free program
will offer tracking
system for students
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
For the Daily
The Department of Public Safe-
ty is launching a new program in
an effort to track down stolen lap-
tops. Anyone associated with the
University who has a unigname is
now eligible to register their com-
puter or other valuable electronics
- like an iPod or Xbox - on the
DPS website.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the aim of the program
is to address the relatively frequent
problem of laptop thefts. There
were 113 such incidents in 2008,
and 88 so far in 2009. The Hatcher
Graduate Library had the highest
concentration of laptop thefts over
this period, according to Brown.
"Laptop thefts have been
becoming an increasing challenge
as people leave them unattended,"
she said.
According to Brown, between

100 and 120 devices have been reg-
istered thus far.
Individuals interested in regis-
tering their laptops provide DPS
with their names and contact
information, as well as the make,
model and serial number of their
laptops.
In turn, DPS sends them two
stickers. The first is a large blue
sticker to be placed on the front of
the computer that states that the
machine is registered property.
The second is a small sticker with
a bar code that lists the DPS iden-
tification number.
Brown said the identification
sticker will be very useful in track-
ing down stolen laptops.
"That particular sticker is man-
ufactured in such a way that when
you try to remove it, it will leave a
residue," she said. "So the theory
is that this should deter some lap-
top thefts because it will be a little
more difficult, we hope, for them
to pawn them."
Though DPS is implement-
ing the plan, the original idea
came from the Michigan Student
Assembly's Campus Safety Com-

Non-profit teaches
high schoolers the
lessons of debate
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Detroit Urban Debate Educa-
tion, a campus organization cre-
ated by a group of students on the
University's debate team, is in the
running to win a $10,000 grant
that group members say will help
them change the lives of some stu-
dents in Detroit's troubled public
high schools.
The money would come from
an online competition hosted by
ideablob.com.
Detroit Urban Debate Educa-
tion is a non-profit student orga-
nization started to help create
a stronger debate program in
Detroit's public high schools.
LSA senior Edmund Zagorin, a
member of the Michigan Debate
Team,helped to found the organiza-

cionlastyear.Hesaidhewasinspired
by a sociology class in which he and
his classmates taught the art of
debate to prisoners at a local jail.
"It got to the point where a lot
of the prisoners were saying, 'This
class is great, but we wish we had
it in high school before we com-
mitted crimes and were in jail,'"
Zagorin said.
Zagorin's experience with
inmates prompted himto establish
DUDE with other Debate Team
members in order to support and
expand existing debate programs
in Detroit's public high schools.
Group members applied for
the organization because with
the DUDE's rapid and remark-
able growth has been too fast and
demanding for the club's current
budget, Zagorin said. He said win-
ning the ideablob.comcompetition
would be an "unbelievable break"
for the organization.

NASAL PREVENTION

Fast on their feet

To che non-debater, listening
tu a debate round may feel like
life in fat-forward.
Keeping up with the Univer-
ity of Michigan Debate Team
means prenenting and refuting
arguments at 300 to 400 words
per minute, according to debater
Maria Liu, an LSA sophomore. To
put this into pernpective, the aver-
age conversation ia carried out at
i10 to i50 wordsaper minute.
"We do a lotuofresearch before
the school year starts and we
have prep time during rounds to
formulate arguments," Liu said.
"Butcthere's also a lot of thinking
on your feet."
Each debate season begins
with the introduction of a new
topic, around which every tour-
nament for the year is framed.
The theme this year deals with
how the U.S. government should
address nuclear weapons prolif-
eration.
Debates throughout the year

can vary anywhere from philo-
sophical issues to concerns with
international relations to deci-
sions regarding U.S. domestic
and foreign policy.
The i4-member team partici-
pates in four to five tournaments
every semester at different uni-
versities across the country.
Tournaments consist of several
rounds in which teams are guar-
anteed an equal number of affir-
mative and negative stances.
Debaters compete in pairs, and
each is permitted a nine-minute
constructive speech, a six-min-
ute rebuttal speech, three min-
utes of cross-examination time
and 10 minutes of preparation
time.
To prepare for an upcom-
ing season, the team meets for
a week of extensive training,
which involves research on the
season's topic, speech drills and
other exercises before fall semes-
ter begins.

"We spend a lot of time in the
Michigan library system doing
computer-based research,"
Coach Aaron Kall said. "All of the
arguments mustcbe supported by
evidence, facts, figures, articles
and dissertations."
During the year, team mem-
bers have scheduled meetings
every week, as well as occasional
mock debates as practice for
competitions.
The most recent tourna-
ment took place at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky, where Liu and
LSA junior Edmund Zagorin
advanced to the octafinals, tom-
peting as one of the tournament's
top 16 teams among 133 others.
Zagorin also won the 1tch place
speaker award out of 266 other
debaters.
The Debate Team's next tour-
nament is scheduled for Hallow-
een weekend and will take place
at Harvard University.

NEWS BRIEFS
0 KABUL
Karzai accepts runoff
inAfghan elections
A grim President Hamid Karzai
bowed to intense U.S. pressure and
agreed yesterday to arunoff election
Nov. 7, acknowledging he fell short
ofa majority after U.N.-backed audi-
tors stripped him of nearly a third of
his votes.
With the fraud investigation com-
pleted, election officials must now
scramble to organize a new ballot as
the fierce Afghan winter approach-
es and the country faces a growing
threat from Taliban insurgents.
President Barack Obama said
he called Karzai to welcome his
willingness to run in a new elec-
tion against his main rival Abdul-
lah Abdullah. "President Karzai's
constructive actions established an
important precedent for Afghani-
stan's new democracy," Obama
said."
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon also complimented Karzai's
decision but stressed that a new
election will be a "huge challenge."
"We have learned very valu-
able but painful lessons from the
first election," Ban told reporters
at U.N. headquarters in New York.
"We must not repeat what they
have done last time."
WASHINGTON
Justices to decide
if detainees can be
released into U.S.
The Supreme Court said yester-
day it will hear a new case about the
rights of Guantanamo detainees, this
time involving prisoners who remain
in custody even after the Pentagon
determines they're not a threat to the
United States.
The high court said it will take a
challenge from Chinese Muslims
at the U.S. naval base in Cuba who
are asking the court to put some
teeth into a June 2008 ruling that
said federal judges could ultimately
order some detainees to be released,
depending on security concerns and
other circumstances.
The 13 Chinese Muslims, or
Uighurs, who remain at Guantana-
mo have been cleared by the Penta-
gon for release since 2004, yet have
been held roughly eight years.
A federal appeals court over-
turned a judge's order to give the
Uighurs their freedom, saying judges
lacked authority to order detainees
released into the United States.
VATICAN CITY
New Vatican plan to
welcome disaffected
Anglicans
The Vatican announced a stun-
ning decision yesterday to make
it easier for Anglicans to convert,
reaching out to those who are dis-
affected by the election of women
and gay bishops to join the Catholic
Church's conservative ranks.
Pope Benedict XVI approved a
new church provision that will al-
low Anglicans to join the Catholic
Church while maintaining many of

their distinctive spiritual and litur-
gical traditions, including having
married priests.
Cardinal William Levada, the
Vatican's chief doctrinal official, an-
nounced the new provision at a new
conference.
In the past, such exemptions had
only been granted in a few cases in
certain countries. The new church
provision is designed to allow An-
glicans around the world to access
a new church entity if they want to
convert.
RIVER ROUGE, Mich.
Asphalt fire spews
thick, black smoke
near Detroit
Billows of thick, black smoke
could be seen for miles yesterday
after a fire engulfed an asphalt spill
nearly the size of a football field in an
industrial area southwest of Detroit.
The blaze at Michigan Marine
Terminal in River Rouge was large-
ly contained to its outdoor storage
yard. Paving-grade asphalt ignited
as workers cleaned a 70-square-yard
area where the asphalt leaked from
a nearby storage tank in May, man-
ager Curt Robinson said. A roughly
100-gallon oil tank also exploded
into the air during the fire.
No injures were reported.
The cause of the fire wasn't imme-
diately known. Investigators were
interviewing contractors who were
cleaning up the asphalt before the
fire ignited around 9 a.m.

Mich. public
sec'tor jobs
dropping

ERIC RISBERG/AP
Packets of marijuana buds are shown for sale at the San Francisco Medical Cannabis Clinic in San Francisco on Monday. Pot-
smoking patients or their sanctioned suppliers should not be targeted for federal prosecution in states that allow medical mariuana,
prosecutors were told Monday in a new policy memo issued by the Justice Department.
Pot advocates:More lenient
guidelnes leave questions

Local and state
government,
teaching jobs among
those most affected
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - The
number of public employees in
the state has been dropping since
mid-2005 as the poor economy has
forced school districts and govern-
ments to trim staff, adding to the
state's already high unemployment
rate, according to a new report
released Monday.
The study, by the nonpartisan
Citizens ResearchCouncil of Mich-
igan, notes that local government
employment levels dropped 6 per-
cent between 2000 and 2008, while
K-12 jobs dropped 12 percent, and
state government jobs dropped 16
percent.
Michigan has had the nation's
highest jobless rate for most of the
past four years, largely because
of a huge drop in manufacturing
jobs, many of them tied to the auto
industry. But all sectors have been
affected. The state jobless rate
climbed to 15.3 percent last month,
with Michigan losing more than
300,000 jobs in the past year and
827,400 since June 2000.
Public school teachers, state
and local government, employees,
university and community college
workers and those at public health
care facilities make up about 17 per-
cent of Michigan's work force. They
account for about 7 percent of total
personal income in the state, with

state and local governmentpayrolls
totaling about $24 billion annually.
"State and local public sector
jobs, as evidenced by these payroll
figures, are not an insignificant
portion of Michigan's economic
base," the report said.
It notes that some areas of pub-
lic employment aren't shrinking.
Public sector jobs at hospitals rose
27percent between2000 and2008,
while jobs at public universities and
community colleges rose 9 percent.
But state government is another
story. The state's civil service work
force shed nearly 14 percent of its
jobsbetween2002and2004.While
statejobsweremorestablebetween
December 2007 and June 2009,
that's partly because state govern-
ment cut costs by using unpaid fur-
loughs rather than more layoffs.
Since 2001, the state has seen its
number of workers decrease16 per-
cent, dropping from around 63,000
workers to 53,200.
Looking ahead, CRC expects
public employment to continue
its downward trend, although the
slide will be alleviated somewhat
because of federal recovery act dol-
lars.
. A recent report on the jobs creat-
ed or saved by the stimulus money
shows around 14,500 of Michigan's
19,$00 total jobs tied to the stimulus
money were atschools or related to
education.
But the CRC report says those
are the jobs that could see the big-
gest hit once the stimulus dollars
disappear, since education makes
up the biggest concentration of
local public sector jobs.

New Obama policy
loosens guidelines on
federal prosecution of
medical marijuana
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A new
Obama administration policy loos-
ening guidelines on federal pros-
ecution of medical marijuana on
Monday signaled to users that they
had less to fear from federal agents
but still left their suppliers to con-
tend with a tangled mesh of state
laws and regulations.
The Justice Department told
federal prosecutors that targeting
people who use or provide medi-
cal marijuana in strict compliance
with state laws was not a good use
of their time.
Marijuanaadvocatesandpatients
called the memo an encouraging
step forward from the strict anti-
pot policies of the Bush administra-
tion. But many worried that the web
of laws in the 14 states that allow
medical marijuana use could still
leave medical marijuana providers
vulnerable to prosecution.
"Now we've got to figure out
what these words actually mean,"
said Wayne Justmann, a longtime
pro-pot activist in San Francisco
who campaigned for the 1996 ballot
measure that made California the
first state to legalize medical mari-
juana.
The state stands out for the

inconsistent enforcement of medi-
cal marijuana laws. There are as
many as 800 storefront pot shops in
Los Angeles just as some dispensary
owners are starting decades-long
sentences in federal prison. Some
cities are trying to clamp down
on medical marijuana, while oth-
ers offer permits and collect taxes
on dispensaries just like any other
small business.
The confusion makes some medi-
cal marijuana backers skeptical that
anyone can feel secure they are
clearly in compliance with state law
and safe from federal prosecution.
"There's just too much disagree-
ment about what the law is," said
Dale Gieringer, director of the
California chapter of The National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws. "The legality of
almost anything is in doubt in Cali-
fornia when it comes to dispensa-
ries."
On Monday, for example, a state
judge temporarily barred Los Ange-
les from enforcing a ban on medical
marijuana clinics, ruling that the
City Council failed to follow state
law.
California also stands alone for
the widespread presence of store-
front dispensaries, but places to
legally obtain pot are starting to
sprout in other states. Colorado
also has dispensaries, and Rhode
Island and New Mexico are in the
process of licensing providers.
Marijuana is effective intreating
chronic pain and nausea, among

other ailments, advocates say. In the
past, federal agents have focused
on busting dispensaries they said
were using medical marijuana as a
front for traditional drug-dealing
and earning millions in the process.
The Justice Department's latest
memo suggests that approach will
continue.
"We will not tolerate drug traf-
fickers who hide behind claims of
compliance with state law to mask
activities that are clearly illegal,"
Attorney General Eric Holder said
in a statement.
The Justice Department memo
emphasizes that prosecutors have
wide discretion in choosing which
cases to pursue. In particular, the
memo urges prosecutors to pur-
sue marijuana cases which involve
violence, the illegal use of firearms,
selling pot to minors, money laun-
dering or involvement in other
crimes.
The states that allow some use
of marijuana for medical purposes
are Alaska, California, Colorado,
Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michi-
gan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexi-
co, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont
and Washington, by the govern-
ment's count.

A more diverse campus
'U' must reverse trend through outreach, financial aid
T hough the University opened its doors to more students
than ever before this fall, many minority freshmen who
were admitted didn't accept the offer. The diversity of
the student population has shown a steady yearly decline since
the passage of the state's constitutional ban on affirmative action
in 2006. Making matters worse, recent economic conditions have
made it more difficult for minorities, who disproportionately fall
into lower-income groups, to afford a college education. In order
to reverse this disturbing trend of dwindling minority enroll-
ment, the University must provide more socioeconomic-based
scholarships and improve community outreach programs to pro-

We have a chronic budget problem,
and cuts aren't making it go away:'

proposed state K-12 cuts, as reported yesterday by the Lansing State Journal.

spective students.
On Oct. 13, the University released data
about this year's enrollment statistics. Nota-
bly, the percentage of African-American,
Native-American and Hispanic freshmen
dropped by 11.4 percent - or 69 students
- from last year. The report confirmed an
increase in the number of admissions offers
extended to underrepresented minori-
ties, but more opportunities to enroll were
declined.
These facts expose the negative effects
the state constitutional ban on affirmative
action has had on campus diversity over the
past few years. Losing 11.4 percent of minor-
ity students is a substantial blow to campus
diversity. With fewer and fewer minority
students each year, the University increas-
ingly becomes a place that lacks racial diver-
sity, producing fewer students who have
been exposed to different backgrounds and
experiences. And the more minority stu-
dents the University loses, the less this cam-
pus can appeal to future students. The result
is a campus without the benefits that abroad
swatch of unique and differing students
bring to the intellectual and social experi-
ences of college.
That's not to say this wasn't expected.
The University somewhat anticipated these
consequences by establishing The Center
for Educational Outreach and Academic
Success. The goal of the center's outreach
programs is to make favorable connections
between younger primary and second-
ary students and the University to increase
minority enrollment. But this year's num-

bers show that outreach efforts are, at least
in part, failing. The University must do more
to convince minority students to enroll here.
Its efforts should include a more pronounced
role in visiting minority communities and
courting students the campus needs.
Of course, there is an importantunderlying
problem: money. Lester Monts, University
senior vice provost for academic affairs, told
AnnArborcom on Oct.13'that in interviews,
minority students who declined admission
referenced alack of financial assistance. The
University did its part in accepting more stu-
dents from minority populations, but it didn't
succeed in convincing them that this place
can be affordable. That is a major concern.
Though the University must tiptoe
around restrictions on economic incentives
for minorities as a result of the affirmative
action ban, it should offer more scholar-
ships to all disadvantaged students - many
of which will include minorities. A well-
publicized allocation of University funds to
expand socioeconomic-based financial aid
programs could help counteract the damage
to campus diversity done by the ban and the
tough economy.
Administrators have to start thinking
about more aggressive measures to negate
these effects from the state's affirmative
action ban. The University is rapidly losing a
vital segment of its campus population, and
unless it offers more financial aid and does a
better job of reaching out to communities, it
may lose even more minority students next
year. Such losses have already gone too far.

ver the past five years, during
my time as a Daily columnist,
epithets like "elitist" and "com-
munist" have been
common responses
directed toward me
in the days follow-
ing my columns. My
last column (Noth-
ing is free, not even
speech, 10/05/2009),
as expected,
brought a very dif-
ferent type of bit- IMRAN
ter, personal and SYED
vindictive response.
People just can't
stand anyone mess-
ing with (their understanding of) the
First Amendment.
The vast majority ofthose who were
outraged by my claim - that the First
Amendment isn't an absolute right, but
rather an abstract proxy related to a
larger ideal of free thought - felt that
I was taking an elitist approach. Free
speech must be literal, limitless and
absolute,theyargued,becausewithout
that the little people get crushed. The
government and those with the power
would use arguments of abstractness
to deny true freedom of speech, they
said.
I understand why that argument
seems persuasive, but I maintain that
it's simply not true. No one has bene-
fited as much from the limitless defini-
tion of free speech as big corporations
and those with power. As long as free
speech remains an unqualified abso-
lute, the scenario is one where those
who yellthe loudestwin and the voices
of the little people get drowned out.
A timely example of what I mean
sits before the United States Supreme
Court now - Citizens United v. Fed-
eral Election Commission. The case
- which documents an anti-Hillary
Clinton documentary that the FEC
argued was subject to campaign
finance regulations because it was
essentially a political ad - was origi-

nally heard by the Court last term.
The Supreme Court ordered the case
be reargued this term with special
focus on the constitutional question
of how much regulation government
can maintain over political speech of
corporations.
The Supreme Court has precedents
dictating that corporate money can
and should be regulated, but it may
be ready to reverse those precedents
and open the floodgates of corporate
money and influence in elections.
Why? Nothing other than free speech
gone wild.
Let's go back to an accident that
occurred in 1886. The Supreme Court
heard the case of Santa Clara County
v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company.
That case was about taxation of rail-
road property, but no one remembers
that today. Before oral arguments,
Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite made
an offhand side remark that came to
change everything:
"The court does not wish to hear
argument onthe question whether the
provision in the Fourteenth Amend-
mentto the Constitution, which forbids
a State to deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws, applies to these corporations. We
are all of opinion that it does."
That seems simple enough - the
Court was saying that corporations
have the same protection under the
Constitution that people do. But
that was not the holding of the case.
Nowhere in its written opinion (which
is the only binding precedent that
emerges from the Court) was anything
mentioned about corporate person-
hood. The Court was not deciding the
issue but rather was setting it aside.
But as the case was reported by the
court reporter, himself a former presi-
dent of a railroad company, that off-
hand remark by Waite came to define
an entire branch of new protections
under the law. The awkward proposi-
tion of corporate personhood has mul-
tiple important consequences, but its

impact on free speech is perhaps most
significant.
Because of that doctrine, the
Supreme Court must regard corpora-
tions as people, and it stands ready
today to declare government regula-
tion of corporate spending in elections
to be an improper violation of free
speech. How far the court will go in
its declaration remains to be seen, and
one hopes that the most catastrophic
outcome may yet be avoided. Regard-
less, there is no denying that we stand
at this precipice today solely because
we remain obsessed with the literal
letter of the First Amendment at the
expense of its true spirit.
First Amendment
isn't just a tool for
the powerful.
If we were to take heed of the larger
ideal of a free marketplace of ideas
- where everyone's voice, no matter
how small, has the opportunity to be
heard - we would cast aside ridicu-
lous, absolutist derivations of the
First Amendment that treat money as
speech and regard any regulation of it
as an infringement. Because we have
embraced this extreme view, those
with the most money and power yell
the loudest and drown out those lit-
tle people my critics were so worried
about.
The Court seems prepared today to
remove even the few tiny restrictions
that gave the little people a smallvoice.
Is that really a more comforting notion
than simply accepting that the First
Amendment, like most parts of the
Constitution, is an abstract construct?

Grading the Assembly

During last spring's MSA elections, the
Michigan Vision Party campaigned and won
an election with the promise to return control
of student government to its rightful owners,
the students. As part of this campaign, MVP
also promised to maintain trust between stu-
dents.
Last semester marked a slow start as the
new executive board took time to settle in, and
summer vacation arrived soon after the transi-
tion. The plans they had only begun to set into
motion earned the Assembly and the leader-
ship a grade of C+ from me. Excuses like time
needed for transition and the onset of vacation
are no longer rational - if MSA is to receive a
passing grade for its work this term, it needs to
produce real results.
This is not to say that progress toward our
vision has not been attempted or partially real-
ized. Readers of the Daily may have noted the
attempts to reform the period of time known as
"Community Concerns" so that only germane,
student business is discussed. Unfortunately,
despite the clear mandate we received for our
vision in the last election, MVP still does not
have a firm hold on the Assembly to pass each
of our reforms. This has certainly not kept us
from trying to bring more transparency to the
Assembly and returning it to students, and I am
pleased to note this progress.
Specifically, the forthcoming Constitu-
tional Convention has great potential to make
MSA more relevant to students and constitu-
ent groups. It provides the chance for students
from across campus to fix or dismiss things
that aren't working, as well as create something

that has an opportunity to actually matter to
students. Changing the Constitution could be
a huge step toward making MSA a true stu-
dent government rather than the bureaucratic,
unwieldy institution that it currently is. This
step toward a convention that will help to rep-
resent all corners of campus is unprecedented.
Plenty of small changes have been made. But
our vision is for fundamental overhaul. The
Convention improves the Assembly's grade
from a C+ to a B.
But should you care?
We've already spoken a bit about the poten-
tial of the Convention, but there is so much
more that can also be done as we work toward
making the Assembly more accountable, trans-
parent, and relevant to students. These ideas
cannot be accomplished without the other two
principles guiding it, and a constant influx of
new participants is necessary to keep our vision
alive. MSA Mondays, an improved block M
and a Campus Leaders Luncheon are only the
beginning of our campus improvement effort,
but we need your help to continually improve.
Our biggest obstacle is not the Constitution or
the Assembly itself - it is the apathy that has
plagued the Assembly for so long.
I'd like to issue an invitation and a chal-
lenge to join the Michigan Vision Party. Our
mass meeting, internal elections, and informa-
tion for candidates will be today at 8:00 p.m.
in 3460 Mason Hall. This is your assembly and
your school: What's your vision?
This viewpoint was written by Bradon Smith
on behalf of the Michigan Vision Party.

Celebrate liberty, not government

It is not very often that you hear people say, "Thank
God that the federal government regulates the size of the
holes in my Swiss cheese," or, "I sleep well at night know-
ing that the United States Department of Agriculture's
'Food Safety and Inspection Service' has issued hundreds
of arcane guidelines and standards for my frozen pizza."
Largely hidden from daily life and absent from receipts
and tax forms, regulations are hidden taxes that everyone
pays - even if we don't realize it.
Government regulations are omnipresent. They hike
the cost of our Federal Communications Commission-
regulated alarm clocks, make the drive to class more
expensive through burdensome fuel and safety standards
and increase the cost of a six pack through vast bottling,
labeling and labor mandates.
Surely, the concept of regulation is desirable to most
people in our society. We don't want factories dumping
hazardous materials in the Huron River nor do we think
that car companies should be allowed to make cars that
combust while we are speeding along on the highway.
But is government the best and most efficient means to
achieve these goals? And if it is, is government regulation
morally permissible?
Unfortunately, the growth of government means a shift
from a market economy to a political economy where reg-
ulation is written to benefit political interests, not society
as a whole. This transfer means distorted economic sig-
nals, poorly allocated resources and taxpayer money that
is squandered. We are left with a labyrinth of confusing
- and often pointless - regulations that hurt consumers,

punish business owners and, worst of all, bring smiles to
the faces of lobbyists. One look at the titanic Code of Fed-
eral Regulations lays to rest President Bill Clinton's ludi-
crous claim in1996 that the "eraof big government is over."
On the contrary - big government just keeps growing.
The alternative to the current system is to allow indi-
viduals to make their own decisions about which prod-
ucts they buy, what they put in their own bodies and who
they choose to do business with. Liberty and free markets
in the absence of government coercion are not onlymoral,
but they lead to a healthier, safer, smarter and more pros-
perous society for everyone. This is a reality thatCongress
should keep in mind as it addresses important issues like
health care and energy.
Students need to recognize the expansion of govern-
ment and fight against it. Today, numerous student groups
will celebrate "Liberty on the Diag" from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
to educate students about the benefits of freedom. Partici-
pating groups include College Libertarians, Young Amer-
icans for Freedom, Students for a Sensible Drug Policy,
Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, Students for a
Free Economy and Students of Objectivism. While these
groups don't agree on every issue, they all feel strongly
that more government means less freedom - a specter
that should be avoided like the plague.
Jonathan Slemrod is the president of the
University's chapter of the College Libertarians.
Sam van Kleef is the president of the University
of Michigan's Young Americans for Freedom.

Father Christmas

Trapped in a rookie rut

Bob Dylan's all-time
merriest album
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
I know what you're thinking.
Yes, that Bob
Dylan, and, yes, ***
that holiday - the
same holiday that Bob Dylan
has borne count-
less other cutesy Christmas in
cover albums over the Heart
the years. What Columbia
could possibly
be going through his 68-year-old
head? True, Dylan is no crooner,
especially now. But this is Dylan
after all, and we should know
better than to judge a book by its
cover - heck, Blood on the Tracks
has one of the worst album covers
of all time.
While the idea of a Dylan Christ-
mas album might seem cheap and
misguided, Christmas In the Heart,
contrary to what one might expect,
doesn't sound a bit odd or out of
place. In fact, it's simply delightful:
Far from being transformed (even
with Dylan at the helm), these clas-
sic tracks retain all the warmth of
a Yuletide fire. And their familiar
breeziness is enough to disarm even
the most furrowed brows of Dylan
fanatics and naysayers alike.
The album arrives more than two
months prior to Christmas in order
to raise money for Feeding America,
acharitythatfeedstheimpoverished
nationwide. Dylan agreed to donate
all of his royalties from Heart to the
organization, hoping that, by releas-
ing the album a few months early, its
proceeds might help the homeless
stay fed through the holidays. Quite
the guy, that Bob.
Dylan has worn many hats over
the course of his storied career, and
with Christmas in the Heart he mer-
rily dons Santa's cap for a collection
oftraditional Christmas songs. Hav-
ing crafted an entire career around
retooling American traditional
music, Dylan is tamer with the

By KRISTYN ACHO
For the Daily
Most listeners probably got
their first taste
of The Temper *i
Trap's frothy
sound from The
"500 Days of TemperTrap
Summer." After
appearinginthe Conditions
film, the song Glassnote
"Sweet Disposi-
tion" became an overnight sensa-
tion and practically every indie
blog was citing The Temper Trap
as 2009's "Band to Watch."
But after months of anticipa-
tion for the band's debut album
Conditions, it looks like The Tem-
per Trap may not be destined for
anything more than mere back-
ground music. Leaving behind its
underground persona, the Aussie
quartet has fallen into the trap
of mainstream stadium-primed
indie pop. Conditions feels like a
sell-out, relying on insipid lyrics
and repetitive guitar riffs. We've
heard it all before - and we've
heard it done better by the likes
of Coldplay and U2. And that's
not sayingmuch.
To be fair, Conditions has its high
moments. "Sweet Disposition"
and "The Science of Fear" are the
album's saviors. On "Sweet Dispo-

sition," electric keyboard breezily
plays over Dougy Mandagi's sweet
falsettos, creating atmospheric
and unforgettable melodies.While
the "Science of Fear" may have a
predictable rhythm, it's emotion-
ally gripping and doesn't let up
until the song's end.
Next, "Down River" is a jovial
sing-along that mixes chant-
ing vocals and an orchestra of
instruments including horns,
organs and guitars. The outcome
is a vivid rhythm that builds over
Mandagi's dreamy yelps, and the
song feels as though it could have
been taken directly from Arcade
Inexcusably
lacking in flow.
Fire's Neon Bible. On the sponta-
neous and upbeat "Down River,"
the band finally foregoes its musi-
cal insecurities and lets loose.
The six-minute "Soldier On"
is a haunting track complete
with pulsing guitar parts and a
wailing chorus. It hobbles along
against a depressing and pain-
ful backdrop, relying on tired,
moody and brooding lyrics like,
"Death will you take me tonight,"
and "Keep your heart close to the

ground." The first four minutes
are entranced in acoustic syn-
chronizations before awkwardly
shifting into a dismal rock bal-
lad. Between the dark lyrics and
meandering base, the cacophony
is all too overwhelming.
Mandagi's wide-ranging, high-
pitched vocals are what make the
album memorable. But in tracks
like "Fader," they come off as irri-
tating in a way that can only be
rivaled by the signature skills of
Passion Pit's Michael Angelakos.
"Fader" is The Temper Trap's
shameless attempt at a pop song.
Between the incessant "woo-
hoos" and throwback electric beat,
the track proves to be saccharinely
sweet, like eating cake frosting
straight from the tube - it seems
like the best idea at the time, but
regret inevitably follows. The band
will probably look back on this
attempt to diverge into uncharted
music genres and cringe.
Conditions is a debut album in
every sense of the word. From its
quaint and mainstream pop songs
to its hardcore indie-depression
ballads, it's obvious these guys
struggled to find their point of
view. While Mandagi's bouncing
vocals save the album from com-
plete failure, the album's lack of
fluidity is inexcusable for a band
with so much apparent potential.

COURTESY OF COLUMBIA
All royalties from Christmas in the Heart will be donated to Feeding America.

American Christmas canon, revisit-
ing classics like "Silver Bells," "Little
Drummer Boy" and "The Christmas
Song" in all their tacky glory. Dylan
and his band keep the arrangements
traditional as well, with the record
packing enough musical nostalgia
to match even that most nostalgic of
holidays.
Appropriately enough, a jan-
gling of bells starts the record with
a jolly take on the staple "Here
Comes Santa Claus." A few tracks
later comes "Winter Wonderland,"
replete with female backup singers,
festive arrangements (glockenspiel
and the ever-present jingle bells to
name a few) and lightly brushed
drums. Just a few tracks in, it
becomes apparent that the idea
to make a Christmas record was
indeed a fantastic one: Between the
tastefully jazzy guitars, barbershop
backup vocals and Dylan's elder
growl, it's a wonder Dylan didn't
think of this earlier.
Dylan's voice of late has been
particularly gravelly, evident on his

recent Together Though Life and
especially during his live shows,
and it's no different here. But while
Together Through Life found Dylan
at least attempting some semblance
of his past drawl, Dylan shows his
age here with pride, evoking Louis
Armstrong more than anyone else.
Strangely enough, singing like the
Satchmo suits him well, and Dylan's
wintry rasp makes for the perfect
soundtrack to break out a wool
sweater and sip eggnogto.
Whether or not Dylan's heart
grew three sizes to make this
album, there's no denying Heart's
sweetness. Dylan's weathered
voice lends the songs a poignan-
cy that few can match (save for
maybe Tom Waits). And, thanks
to his band, the record plays like
a kitschier - albeit similarly wist-
ful - A Charlie Brown Christmas.
Though it's clear Dylan's getting
old, he's certainly aging well. And
with Christmas in the Heart, he's
starting to sound a lot like Christ-
mas, too.

ARTS IN BRIEF
Music
Neon Indian's bipolar masterpiece
Neon Indian
Psychic Chasms
Columbia
Like the band's very name suggests, Neon Indian simul-
taneously incorporates both the old and the new. The other-
worldly Technicolor ambiance of Psychic Chasms is rendered
familiar by its reassuring '90s lo-fi mumblings, and a sense of
world-weariness permeates the record despite the bizarrely
bright synths. Psychic Chasms is a study of contrasts - vivid
clarity juxtaposed with jaded burbles, and novelty paired
against the status quo.
Neon Indian is the third musical project of Alan Palomo,
who at the tender age of 21 is also already affiliated with
the now-defunct Ghosthustler as well as VEGA, an ongoing
project. Lyrically, the record is presented in retrospective,
reminiscing on an idealized past from the perspective of a
cynical present. The vocals on Psychic Chasms, although
mostly indiscernible, clearly reflect disillusionment with
the contemporary world and a longing for the past.
"Deadbeat Summer," the discs's most radio-friendly and
appealing track, is a testament to the creative bipolarity of
Neon Indian. The track epitomizes the nature of the release
by mergingthe familiar with the strange. The songhas a nos-
talgic feel of summers long gone, with a backdrop of zingy,
twee electronic bleep-bops. The youthfully druggy "Should
Have Taken Acid With You" is another track with a wist-
ful, slightly melancholy and sentimental sound. The song's
tone is delibeiately sweet and regretful, painting a picture
of halcyon days of yore. The idyllic past is a consistent theme
woven throughout the entirety of Psychic Chasms.
"Mind, Drips" is a distortedly fuzzy '80s flashback with
intermittent electro-pop buzzing reminiscent of retro-
futuristic spaceship sounds. The track is somewhat pre-
dictably gimmicky as a result, but an enjoyable listen in the
guilty pleasure sense. In fact, Psychic Chasms itself is a bit
of a guilty pleasure, with its unabashed embrace of rebel-
without-a-cause-ness. But it's a pleasure to indulge and wal-
low in the past alongside Palomo.
All this rumination on the past may have listeners eager
to hear about the future. The effort ends with the appropri-
ately titled "Seriously, It's Over," leaving us looking forward
to the next stages of Neon Indian.

'Law Abiding Citizen'
murders the very idea of
character development
By NICK COSTON
Daily Arts Writer
In 1817, philosopher and poet Samuel Taylor
Coleridge devised a formula for
fiction known as the suspension *
of disbelief. It theorizes that an
audience is willing to overlook Law Abiding
certain preposterous aspects of MM
a story in order to better engross
itself in the unfolding narrative. At Quality16
"Law Abiding Citizen," the latest and Showcase
film from director F. Gary Gray Overture
("Be Cool"), tries harder to prove
Coleridge wrong than almost any other film this
year. It's so absurd, so nonsensical, so offensively
stupid that one has to wonder if it's some sort of
nihilist exercise in bad filmmaking that exceeds
apathy and dives straight into contempt for logic.
The titular citizen is Clyde Shelton (Gerard
Butler, "300"), a retired spy who goes on a killing
spree from inside prison after his wife and daugh-
ter are killed in the film's first 30 seconds by two
worthless and unimportant characters who have
no connection to the succeeding two hours. Jamie
Foxx ("Collateral") is Nick Rice, a rising star in the
Philadelphia district attorney's office who has built
his career on orchestrating shady plea bargains
- including one. with the murderer .of Shelton's

family. It's up to Rice to stop Shelton's murderous
rampage, because apparently Philadelphia doesn't
have any police officers or detectives.
Speaking of Philadelphia, the audience has no
idea the film takes place in the City of Brotherly
Love until the final 30 minutes (bear in mind that
two of the most important characters are the dis-
trict attorney and the mayor). Characters talk
about terrified citizens evacuating"our proud city,"
and putting a cop on every corner of "the city" and
how Shelton owns a number of properties outside
of"city limits;" meanwhile, the audience throws up
its hands and asks, "What city?"
As District Attorney Rice, Foxx performs about
as admirably as could be imagined of a man playing
a hybrid lawyer-cop. Unless the real Philadelphia
has recently adopted a radical form of law enforce-
ment, its public servants do not fly police helicop-
ters or attempt to defuse bombs or carry a firearm
as Foxx does.
While Foxx doesn't do anything to inspire
hatred - he didn't write his own bad dialogue,
f after all - Butler's performance is a laughable
sight to behold. His accent, purportedly intended
to reflect a native of the United States' East Coast,
falls somewhere between Scottish brogue and
perpetual chewer of skirt steak. His face is con-
tinuously twisted into what is supposed to be an
evil grin but looks more like a visit to the dentist.
More problematic than his bad accent and smile,
however, is his deplorably cold reaction to his
family's murder.
Butler's Shelton is the driving force behind
what makes "Citizen" so loathsome. The problem
begins when director Gray offers no more than a

title card reading "Ten Years Later" to illustrate
Shelton's descent from sorrow to murderous rage.
Although time has passed within the film, the
audience is jarred by the tasteless proximity of
his family's death to the beginning of his rampage
- he captures, tortures and gruesomely murders
the killer within minutes of his family's demise,
real-time. And he does so with a sick smile on his
face, while taunting the helpless criminal he has
strapped to atable in a warehouse basement. Shel-
ton's vengeance is complete, seemingly before the
movie even begins, and it's exacted in a manner
that inspires repulsion rather than sympathy. As
a result, he's given no humanity to counterbal-
ance his villainous qualities.
It's not unreasonable to portray a man violent-
ly deprived of his wife and daughter as mentally
unstable. But Shelton shows no signs of such emo-
tional vulnerability or progression. It's as if this
ice-cold maniac just happened to have been mar-
ried with a child - as if his domestic past has no
genuine impact on his soul, and his family's death
merely provided him with the opportunity to kill
dozens of people and falsely justify it.
"Law Abiding Citizen" has a slew of problems.
It's poorly written, poorly acted and poorly direct-
ed. But worse than that, it's offensive. Ittakes a man
in a potentially vulnerable position and transforms
him, unnecessarily and inexplicably, into a glee-
ful mass murderer. If Gray wanted to make Shel-
ton the villain, that's fine. But by failing to intercut
Shelton's killing spree with some sign - any sign
- of grief for his departed wife and daughter, the
director destroyed the only shred of believability
he might have otherwise achieved.

Worst hiding spot ever.

CITY COUNCIL
From Page 1A
of solid data proving the dam cur-
rently disrupts the natural flow of
the Huron River.
"We rely on the Huron River to
serve as a crown jewel of Washt-
enaw County's natural environ-
ment," Lana Pollack, president
of the Michigan Environmental
Council, wrote in an e-mail to City
Council. "It is therefore especially
distressing year by year to witness
degradation of the river's health
with the increasing growth of
slimy, unsightly aquatic plant life."
Resolution supporters also came
prepared with their own scientific
evidence,whichtheysayconfirmed
the contrary.
Ann Arbor resident Jeff DeBoer
addressed the council, arguing that
the river would revert to its natural
course if Argo Dam is removed but
that it would not be a good thing.
He said this natural course would
take the river through what he calls
the toxic property of nearby DTE
Energy Company, which would be

bad for the water.
DeBoer said that if the dam was
removed it might be possible to
reroute the river to take a differ-
ent path, but he said this would be
expensive.
Joe O'Neal, owner of O'Neal
Construction Company, whose
company oversaw the construc-
tion of Argo Dam, estimated that
removing the dam will cost $1 mil-
lion in addition to $750,000 to $1
million to train the river to flow a
different course.
He explained that removal of the
dam itself is not a large expense,
but training the river and convert-
ing the river to a recreation area
will surpass the cost of a yearly
maintenance fee of $100,000 for
the dam.
Another speaker Ron Wood-
man provided what he presented
as scientific evidence of his own -
drinking water from Argo Pond out
of a clear Starbucks coffee cup - to
demonstrate that the water was
clean and capable of sustaining a
healthy environment.
Rubin, on the other hand, said
she was not convinced.

"I don't think there's any valid-
ity to it," she said after the meeting.
"The irony is we're here to protect
the river and the watershed. The
last thing we want to do is have it
run through the most contaminat-
ed site in the city."
Supporters of the "dam-in" reso-
lution also argued that removing
the dam would destroy a recreation
area enjoyed by many who canoe,
kayak or fish on the river. of spe-
cial interest in the pond's preserva-
tion are members of local rowing
teams.
Crew members from Huron High
School and Pioneer High school
appeared in their uniforms to sup-
port the resolution. Many supports
also held signs that read "Save Argo
Pond."
Susan Washabaugh, a teacher at
Pioneer High School, said in her
address to the council that row-
ers rely on Argo Pond as a practice
venue.
The council's final decision to
table the issue left supporters of the
resolution frustrated.
"I think it's really unfortunate."
DeBoer said. "The council as we

saw again last night is doing the
public a real disservice by not
addressing this issue head-on and
making some decisions and direct-
ing city staff to take action."
In her initial speech, Rubin had
vied for tabling the resolution until
further information is obtained and
more investigations are conducted.
"I was very happy with the out-
come," Rubin said. "I think it was a
premature decision to vote on Argo
'dam-in' or Argo 'dam-out.' I think
there are many questions that
the city staff has not answered in
terms of if the dam were to stay or
go how will some of these costs be
funded, where will they come out
of, what are the options for recre-
ation, what are options for rowing
and what are the environmental
benefits."
For now, the resolution to main-
tain Argo Dam is still up in the air
until City Council settles the issue.
But many council members were
pleased with the debate.
"Both sides have a clear vision,"
Briere said. "They both have pas-
sion and they both have evidence to
support their viewpoint."

Michigan Senate
sends six budget
bills to governor

Budget bills
contain more than
$1 billion in cuts
LANSING, Mich.(AP) - Repub-
lican Senate Majority Leader Mike
Bishop sent the final six budget
bills to Gov. Jennifer Granholm
yesterday with a warning not to
expect any additional money for
programs she wants to restore.
Michigan lawmakers have
passed a series of budget bills
containing more than $1 billion
in cuts to address a projected $2.8
billion shortfall in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.

Granholm has signed all the
other budget bills and vetoed
spending in some of them. She has
said she may veto portions of the
remaining six as well, although
she hasn't given specifics. Bishop
told her that would be unwise.
"Do not veto portions of these
budgets with the expectation that
money will be reappropriated
at a later date to fund the vetoed
programs," he wrote in a letter to
the Denocratic governor. "There
is not sufficient support in the
Senate Republican caucus for tax
increases and for you to think oth-
erwise is a mistake."
The state is operating under an
interim budget that expires Oct.
31, and Granholm must act on the
bills by then or risk another gov-
ernment shutdown.
The six bills submitted yester-
day cover general government
expenses, human services, state
police, community health, higher
education, and energy, labor and
economic growth. They passed
both the House and Senate 20
days ago but were put on hold in
a parliamentary move by Republi-
cans who control the Senate.
Bishopsaidheheld onto thebills
because he didn't want Granholm
to veto portions and leave the state
with a deficit that could require
tax increases. But Granholm said
Bishop needs to compromise to
save important programs.
"I would ask him to not be rigid
and that he be willing to compro-
mise so we can bring this awful
budget year to a conclusion," she
told reporters after receiving
Bishop's letter.
Granholm wants limited tax
and fee increases to pay for pro-
grams that were eliminated or
severely cut, such as the Michi-
gan Promise Grant scholarships,
Medicaid, public schools and
money local governments use for
police and fire protection.
She said yesterday she would
support a new license for bars and
restaurants thatwantto sell alcohol
until 4 a.m. or on Sunday mornings,
higher taxes on tobacco products
other than cigarettes, smaller busi-
ness tax exemptions and a freeze
on an inflationary increase in the
state income tax personal exemp-
tion - or any changes Republicans
would support.
But Bishop said he and other
Senate Republicans see no need
to raise taxes, especially since
the state will face a shortfall next
year as well. He wants Granholm
to abide by the budget cuts that
passed the Republican-controlled
Senate and Democratic-con-
trolled House.
During a news conference
yesterday, the governor said the
Senate must put more money into
the public schools budget, since it
doesn't include enough revenue to
cover its costs.
On Monday, she vetoed $54
million from the $12.9 billion bud-
get bill because she said there's
a shortfall of as much as $264
million in the pian. Most of the
vetoed funds would have gone to
39 school districts that get among
the highest per-pupil payments in
the state - some nearly $4,000
more than the lowest per-pupil
grant.
Suburban Detroit districts
such as Livonia, Dearborn and
Walled Lake would take the big-
gest hits, losing more than $4.7
million each.
The budget slashing angered

Oakland County Executive L.
Brooks Patterson. Many of the
affected districts are in Michi-
gan's wealthiest county north and
west of Detroit.
"In one fell swoop, Granholm
has gone from the 'Education Gov-
ernor' to the 'Eradication Gover-
nor,"' Patterson said in a Tuesday
statement. "The gurgling you'll
hear during this fiscal year will be
the sound ofschool districts across
our region going under."
Bishop said there was no short-
fall in the public schools budget
and called the veto "extortion."
He pointed out the Senate has
passed a bill canceling a scheduled
increase in a tax credit for low-
income workers that would raise
$100 million more for schools.
"The veto clearly was done toget
areaction from the Legislature,"he
told reporters. "The only reaction
she wants is a tax increase."
Some House Democrats oppose
freezing the Earned Income Tax
Credit, and the House has not acted
on the Senate measure. But Gra-
nholmsaid the bill doesn't solve the
deficit because all Bishop did was
move money around, using money
saved to pay for a partial rollback of
a business taxsurcharge.

New formula
shows poverty
in U.S. worse
than thought

GUILLERMO ARIAS/AP
People walk in a neighborhood as Tropical Storm Rick approaches Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, yesterday.
Tropical Storm stirs concerns over
floods and landslides in New exico

Forecasters say
Tropical Storm Rick
could dump as much
as six inches of rain
LOS CABOS, Mexico (AP) -
Tropical Storm Rick threatens to
trigger dangerous flash floods and
mud slides when it makes landfall
in western Mexico after sparing
Baja California's glitzy resorts a
direct blow.
InSinaloa,whereRickisexpect-
ed to make landfall Wednesday,
authorities suspended classes for
two days in cities along the state's
southern coast.
Gov. Jesus Aguilar asked resi-
dents in a radio message to pay
close attention to civil protection
advisories and said soldiers were
ready to help with possible evacu-
ations.
The U.S. National Hurricane

Center in Miami put Rick on a
projected path south of the tip
of the Baja California Penin-
sula overnight, on course to hit
the mainland near Mazatlan on
Wednesday.
Forecasters said Rick could
dump 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cen-
timeters) of rain in some areas
in the states of Baja California,
Sinaloa and Durango and warned
of possible flash floods and mud
slides.
Over the weekend, Rick's winds
were clocked at 180 mph (290 kph)
- making it the strongest hurri-
cane in the eastern North Pacific
region since 1997 - and it kicked
up high waves hundreds of miles
(kilometers) away that killed at
least two people. But the storm
spent its force far out at sea and
weakened over cooler waters.
Rick's maximum sustained
winds were down to 65 mph (105
kph) Tuesday night,the Hurricane
Center said. It was centered about

135 miles (215 kilometers) south-
southeast of Cabo San Lucas and
moving to the north-northeast at
12 mph (19 kph).
Los Cabos Mayor Oscar Rene
Nunez said officials would close
schools there and urged residents
living in makeshift homes and
those in flood zones to seek shel-
ter.
Caravans of police cars, mili-
tary vehicles and buses fanned out
to "high-risk neighborhoods" in
low-lying areas across Los Cabos
to evacuate residents.
Carlos Guevara, the Cabo San
Lucas civil defense coordinator,
said people became complacent
as the afternoon rains dissipated
and the sky began to clear.
"We have this storm in front
of us. It has not passed," he cau-
tioned in a meeting of government
officials.
Alejandro Flores, a 28-year-old
waiter, said Tuesday night that he
spent the last few days piling dirt

around the side of his house to
guard it from floodwaters. He and
his wife were preparing to leave
their neighborhood, where the
pitted dirt roads are commonly
inundated during hurricane sea-
son.
"I am very afraid of the flood-
ing," Flores said.
Meanwhile, far out in the Pacif-
ic Ocean, Hurricane Neki was
centered about 630 miles (1,015
kilometers)southwestofHonolulu
and about 340 miles (547 kilome-
ters) east-southeast of Johnston
Island. Maximum winds were at
about 75 mph (120 kph).
Forecasters predicted Neki
would brush by tiny Johnston
island on Wednesday.
The uninhabited island, which
is part of the isolated Johnston
Atoll, is under the primary juris-
diction and control of the U.S. Air
Force. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service has a national wildlife
refuge there.

Revised calculation
shows poverty rate
to be at 15.8 percent,
nearly one in six
WASHINGTON (AP) - The level
of poverty in America is even worse
than first believed.
A revised formula for calculating
medical costs and geographic varia-
tions show that approximately 47.4
million Americans last year lived
in poverty, 7 million more than the
government's official figure.
The disparity occurs because
of differing formulas the Census
Bureau and the National Acad-
emy of Science use for calculat-
ing the poverty rate. The NAS
formula shows the poverty rate to
be at 15.8 percent, or nearly 1 in 6
Americans, according to calcula-
tions released this week. That's
higher than the 13.2 percent, or
39.8 million, figure made avail-
able recently under the original
government formula..
That measure, created in 1955,
does not factor in rising medical
care, transportation, child care or
geographical variations in living
costs.Nordoes it considernon cash
government aid when calculating
income. As a result, official figures
released last month by Census may
have overlooked millions of poor
people, many of them6 and older.
According to the revised NAS
formula:
-About 18.7 percent of Ameri-
cans 65 and older, or nearly 7.1 mil-
lion, are in poverty compared to 9.7
percent, or 3.7 million, under the
traditional measure. That's due to
out-of-pocket expenses from rising
Medicare premiums, deductibles
and a coverage gap in the prescrip-
tion drugbenefit.
-About 14.3 percent of people 18

to 64, or 27 million, are in poverty,
compared to 11.7 percent under the
traditional measure. Many of the
additional poor -are low-income,
working people with transporta-
tion and child-care costs.
-Child poverty is lower, at about
17.9 percent, or roughly 13.3 mil-
lion, compared to 19 percent under
the traditional measure. That's
because single mothers and their
children disproportionately receive
non-cash aid such as food stamps.
-Poverty rates were higher for
non-Hispanic whites (11 percent),
Asians (17 percent) and Hispan-
ics (29 percent) when compared to
the traditional measure. For blacks,
poverty remained flat at 24.7 per-
cent, due to the cushioning effect
of non-cash aid.
-The Northeast and West saw
bigger jumps in poverty, due large-
ly to cities with higher costs of liv-
ing such as New York, Boston, Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
The Census Bureau said it expe-
dited release of the alternative
numbers for this month because of
the interest expressed by lawmak-
ers and the Obama administration
in seeing, a fuller range of num-
bers. Legislation pending in Con-
gress would mandate a switch to
the revised formula, although the
White House could choose to act
on its own.
Arloc Sherman, a senior
researcher at the nonprofit Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities,
said that because the revised for-
mula factors in non-cash govern-
ment aid, the amount of increase
in poverty from 2007 to 2008 was
generally smaller compared to the
current measure.
"Food stamp participation rose
during the first year of recession
and appears to have softened what
could have been an even greater
increase in financial hardship,"
he said.

University Housing could ditch
same-hall, same-room policy

From Page 1A
not yet been decided how it will
determine which students will be
eligible to return.
Housing also plans to reserve
rooms for the University's seven
residential Michigan Learn-
ing Communities. Each learning
community decides which stu-
dents can remain in the program.
Unlike other residents, students
returning to a learning commu-
nity will have the opportunity to
stay in their current hallway, but
whether they will have the choice
to stay in their same room is not
yet known.
After adding up the space allo-
cations from all residence halls,
Logan said Housing could not come
up with a plan that would permit
students to keep their same room
or hall if they so wished, while also
giving other students a choice of
where they want to live.
"One of the biggest concerns
we've had is that if we try to shuffle
around the number of spaces to
accommodate the students who
had been living in Baits or Mark-
ley or Couzens, and give them an
upper hand in the selection process
in some other hall, then it really
complicates the process for the stu-
dents in those other halls wanting
to reapply," he said.
With these compounding prob-
lems before them, the University
has been discussing changes for the
sign-up policy during the last sever-
al months. Part of that process has
been an analysis of how the process
has played out in the past.
According to Logan, the number
of students applying for the same

room and same hall has continu-
ously declined over the last four
years. Comparing the process in
2006 to that in 2009, 115 fewer stu-
dents applied for the same room,
while 593 fewer students applied
for the same hall and learningcom-
munity.
On the other hand, the number
of students participating in the
campus-wide lottery has increased
526 students - from 1,202 in 2006
to 1,728 in 2009.
Logansaid the increasingpartic-
ipation in the lottery has indicated
that more students are interested
in switching halls and that elimi-
nating the same room-same hall
option would solve some of the
problems. ,
The lottery will be determined
based on the number of consecutive
years a student has lived in cam-
pus housing - with students with
more years receiving a better lot-
tery bracket. Logan said he believes
students who have lived in the resi-
dence halls for a longer period of
time won't experience a difference
in their housing placements.
"We feel that the students who
have been living with us for a
couple years, and who have that
advantage of lower lottery brackets
because of their seniority probably
won't notice much in the way of
outcomes," he said.
LSA junior Caitlin Sadler,
president of the Residence Halls
Association, said she thinks the
campus-wide lottery will keep the
sign-up system "relatively fair" and
that the policy willbe well received
in the future.
"I think overall, looking at this in
three or four years, it's going to be

really well-accepted, and it's going
to be part of the overall policy,"
Sadler said. "I think the shift might
be a little bit difficult, but it is a bet-
ter system I feel in the long run, so
it's worth making that shift."
Engineering freshman Mina
Georges is a member of MCSP
in Couzens. He said he wants to
return to MCSP next year - even
if it's in another location - because
he enjoys learning about the urban
policy and environmental issues
the program teaches.
"If the program is going to con-
tinue, and we're just going to live in
a different place, it won't matter for
me that much," Georges said.
But he said he does not agree
with Housing's proposal that would
prevent students from returning to
the same hall.
"I think they should just leave it
(the way it is)," he said. "If someone
feels comfortable at some place,
why do you have to make them
change?"
LSA sophomore Tatiana Hortig
also expressed concern about the
new plan. Hortig is living in Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall for a second
year with a few friends she met in
Alice Lloyd last year. She said it
would have been terrible if they got
split up and couldn't live together
in the same hall.
"I can't imagine if this year
they put me in some random dorm
because I would have lost contact
with them," she said.
According to Logan, a final deci-
sion about the new process will be
made within the next few weeks.
Information regarding housing
applications will be available in
November.

Why isBrow
thinking roses.
t's such a far cry from last season that it just feels sort of
weird, and a tad too soon.
Is Michigan - the same program that went 3-9 last year -
flirting with the Rose Bowl?
Really? Well, no. But senior linebacker Ste-
vie Brown is shyly trying out for the part of
Nostradamus.
"Strange things have always happened,"
Brown said. "I feel like maybe if we can win
out, there's a good chance we could get to the
Rose Bowl."
A hell of a lot would have to go right for
Michigan to be in that situation, to say the
least.
First off, Michigan would have to beat MICHAEL
schools that its scout team couldn't beat. EISENSTEIN
(Sorry, Delaware State.) We're talking about
teams like No. 13 Penn State, Wisconsin and
No. 18 Ohio State.

arters rest,

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
According to senior Stevie
Brown, everyone on the Michigan
football team likes to give scout
teamer Ohene Opong-Owusu a
hard time.
Brown said the Wolverines will
poke fun at the fifth-year senior
for his body shape and walking
style. But in Michigan's 63-6 win
over Delaware State, the Wolver-
ines (1-2 Big Ten, 5-2 overall) were
all smiles when Opong-Owusu
saw the field for the first time in
his career on special teams.
"They got a biglift out of the Big
O running down there," Michigan
coach Rich Rodriguez said Mon-
day. "The first one, I didn't know
if he got a tackle or he got a JOP,
I call it a JOP, jump on the pile.
But then the second one, he got a

nice hit on a guy that was trying
to block him, then he got a piece
of the tackle."
Opong-Owusu was one of 84
Wolverines to garner playing time
against the Hornets (1-2 MEAC,
1-4), including one of nine to make
their first collegiate appearance.
"Everybody but the freshmen
we are planning to redshirt got a
chance to go in there," Rodriguez
said. "To see the smiles on their
faces and to see how excited their
teammates were to get them out
there was pretty neat."
Second stringers and beyond
gave Michigan 688 yards of total
offense against the Hornets,
contributing to the Wolverines'
school record 727 total yards of
offense. True freshman tailback
Vincent Smith led the Wolverines
with 166 yards on 17 carries. Red-
shirt freshman Michael Cox and

sophomore MichaelShawfinished
with a combined three scores and
155 yards on the ground.
But even with 73 percent of
Saturday's dress list participat-
ing, Rodriguez said the Michigan
depth chart is staying put.
"I think some guys, we're get-
ting more confidence in," Rodri-
guez said Monday. "But there
wasn't really a situation where,
'Geez, this guy really deserves
to be the starter and that guy
deserves to be his backup.' We
didn't have that jump out at us."
Senior tailbacks Brandon
Minor (ankle) and Carlos Brown
(concussion) also didn't play Sat-
urday. But probably the most
important Wolverine to rest was
freshman quarterback Tate Forci-
er. Last Saturday, Forcier started
the game and completed two
passes, but roamed the sidelines

after his one drive.
After injuring his shoulder
against Indiana and suffering a
mild concussion against Iowa,
Forcier's bodyhas been banged up
and he has struggled on the field.
In the four games before injuring
his shoulder, Forcier completed
an impressive 62.1 percent of his
87 passes. In the three games
since, his completion percentage
has fallen to 50.9 percent.
In Forcier's place last Saturday,
fellow freshman Denard Robin-
son stepped in fluidly, complet-
ing three of his four passes. Often
typecast as a pure runner, Robin-
son threw his first career touch-
down passes, connecting with
redshirt freshman slot receiver
Kelvin Grady and junior tight end
Martell Webb. The freshman also
ran for a score.

Michigan takes top-ranked
Penn State to wire but falls short

MEN'S SOCCER
With small but loud
crowd,Akron zips

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer
P Michiganvolleyball coachMark
Rosen put it best: Friday night was
a heavyweight fight for the Wol-
verines.
Michigan was an undersized,
overmatched and less acclaimed
Big Ten opponent than No. 1 Penn
State, the best team - hands down
- in the country.
But none of that mattered to the
11th-ranked Wolverines (5-3 Big

And after four sets, the two
prized fighters were locked at two
apiece.
It was the first time the Nittany
Lions had been taken to five sets in
regular-season play since Sept. 15,
2007 against Stanford.
"That game was definitely a

proved to the country that we're a
really good volleyball team."
But after falling behind 6-2 in
the final frame, the Wolverines'
bid for an upset slowly evapo-
rated inside a sold-out Cliff Keen
Arena.
Michigan lost the third set
15-12 in what may have been Penn
State's toughest regular-season
match during its 52-match win-
ning streak in conference play.
"We're trying to not just focus
on the end product," Rosen said.
"We've been more concerned with
how are we performing. Are we
controlling the ball, and are we
doing the things that we need to
do to be successful? (Friday) night,
we did that and we lost. But at the
same time, if you look at the pro-
cess, we did everything we want-
ed to do."

Unfortunately for Michigan,
they had a lot to hoot and holler
about.
The Zips pummeled the Wol-

poorest performances of the sea-

son. Akron (14-0-0) pressured
Wolverine defenders and forwards
alike, forcing errant passes that
often translated, into Michigan
turnovers. The Zips were equally
as aggressive on the attacking
half, moving the ball quickly and
catching the Wolverines out of
position.
"We knew we were going to be
up against a good team," senior
captain Julian Robles said. "I
don't know why, maybe we just
gave them too much respect and
didn't play our game."
Akron's stingy defense has
surrendered just three goals on a
mere 25 shots on goal this season.
Nevertheless, Michigan (1-2 Big

halftime. Meram netted Michigan's
only goal in the 48th minute, but the
Zips quickly quelled any hopes for a
comeback by scoring on the ensuing
possession.
While the Zips joined their
rowdy fans at the edge of the field to
celebrate their 14th consecutive vic-
tory, Michigan players circled their
disgruntled coach. Frustrated, they
shook their heads as they reflected
hitting errors.
One of the biggest improve-
ments from last year may have
been the Wolverines' .191 attack
percentage.
With that, Michigan showed it
could compete against the nation's
best. Rosen's team responded to
a challenge but came up a punch
short of defeating Penn State.
"(Friday) night was a huge turn-
ing point for us, just in terms of
the Big Ten," sophomore middle
blocker Courtney Fletcher said.
"Basically, we're just going to go
out and treat everyone with respect

"Sometimes a thorough ass-kick-

After the Buckeyes (3-5, 15-6)

set, Michigan responded by win-
ning the next three sets to salvage
the weekend split.
Michigan had four players with
double-figure kills. Sophomore
right side Alex Hunt led the offen-
sive attack with 11, while junior
setter Lexi Zimmerman notched 37
assists in the winning effort.
"Ohio State was good coming out

Offensive woes continue for
Wolverines in conference tie

StartCYour Career
in Accounting.

By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Writer
It has now been 383 minutes
since the Michigan women's soc-
cer team has put the ball in the
back of the net, and the Wolverine
offense is becoming restless.
That restlessness is quickly
turning into frustration.
Late in the first half, junior
defender Sarah Stanczyk pushed
Indiana senior defender Kelly
Lawrence through the caution
tape on the side of the soccer field
and onto rocks that were at the
ft s edge. ;
Stanczyk said the push was
tional,a b thing the
ae ay als that no testion.
"Before the game, there wastalk
about No. 2 (Lawrence)," Stanczyk
said. "She stepped on one of the
girls' faces at the end of last year's
game. We knew she was a player
we wanted to watch out for."
Once Lawrence was treated by
the medical trainer for the fall, she
jumped to the sideline and called
her teammate out of the game for a
substitution. However, one referee
pointed the teammate back to the
field and said it wasn't yet time for
subs.
Aggression and confusion
ensued, which epitomized the
nature of Sunday's 0-0 stalemate
between Michigan (0-2-3 Big Ten,
5-7-3 overall) and the Hoosiers
(1-2-2 Big Ten, 9-3-2 overall). The
Wolverines had plenty of opportu-
nities but couldn't capitalize.
"We are a little snake bit right
now," Michigan coach Greg Ryan
said at the end of the game. "We're
creating great chances, but not
getting anything."
The Wolverines had three set
plays where playershad the chance
to net the ball. The first was called
back because of an obstructing the
keeper call, and the others were
just missed opportunities. Junior
midfielder and defender Jackie
Carron missed one chance when a
free kick fell right in front of the
net. After a delay, Indiana's goalie

got there first.
Michigan's season-long strug-
gle of pushing the ball forward on
offense was apparent in the first
half.
"As a forward, when I missed, I
wanted to hear positive criticism,"
Michigan junior defender Amanda
Bowery said. "We've just had some
issues at putting the ball to the
back of the net. Today we had a
couple one vs. ones, and we didn't
get lucky."
But the Wolverine defense had
a successful defensive game as it
blanked No. 22 Indiana. Redshirt
freshman goalie Haley Kopmeyer
notched her fourth career shutout,
and she is now tied for second in
program history for most shut outs
in a season.
Last Thursday, against Purdue,
Ryan employed a new defense in
which just three defenders stay
on the back line. This defense
confused the typically aggressive
Hoosier offense the entire game.
"We did a really good job not let-
ting them get behind us and giving
them the opportunity to be dan-

gerous," Kopmeyer said. "We did a
good job shutting down their key
players. The further we pushed
them up the field, the harder it was
for them to take their shots."
Kopmeyer had five saves, par-
tially because the stunned Indiana
offense couldn't take many shots.
Indiana has taken 209 shots this
season, averaging 16 per game.
The Wolverines effectively held
them to just 14, five of which were
on goal.
And the team is trying to trans-
late that defensive toughness into
a mentality if the entire team from
here on out.
"Our coach is always telling
us that people like to play Michi-
gan sometimes because we have a
reputation for being kind of soft,"
Stanczyk said. "So we make it a
bigger issue on the team that we
are going to be more aggressive.
We are going to play tougher and
you always want to give, whoever
you're going up against, a big hit
so they know that you're there to
play and that they can't just go
past you."

"We wanted to get in there

and get him to train with his eyes
and where he's supposed to look,"
Rodriguez said of Robinson. "We
wanted more than (four throws)
but we got up ahead a little bit. But

we were planning on throwing
more with him." t
Learning Rodriguez's playbook
is tough for any quarterback who
is new to the system, and Robinson
and Forcier have looked impres-
sive as freshmen. Forcier sealed
the starting job before Michigan's

season opener against Western
Michigan because participating
in spring practice gave him four
extra months to become familiar
with Rodriguez's system.
But in recent weeks, Forcier's
progress has suffered. Rodriguez
said Monday that Forcier had not
completed a full week of practice
since suffering his shoulder injury.
"If he was a fourth-year or fifth-
year guy missing a practice or two,
maybe it would not be as criti-
cal," Rodriguez said. "When we
look back at it, missing those first
couple days of practice every week
probably didn't help his growth."
During yesterday's Michigan
teleconference, Forcier said he
practiced Monday for the first
time in weeks and plans to practice
every day this week.
"I have full range onit," Forcier
said. "I can actually snap my arm
down on some of my passes. I'm
happy to have it back."

EISENSTEIN
From page 1B
Then, Iowa would either have
to collapse down the stretch
- which seems pretty unlikely
- or the Hawkeyes would have
to make the BCS national cham-
pionship game (also played in
Pasadena this year). That seems
like a longshot given how com-
fortably the SEC and Big 12
teams are sitting at the top of
the rankings.
There is more that would also
have to fall into place, but why
explain how to fill up the gas
tank if you can't even drive?
Yet still, Brown kept repeat-
ing himself.
"I have a feeling," Brown
said. "I don't know if anybody
else has a feeling, but I have this
feeling that if we can win out, I
think we got a chance we could

make it to the Rose Bowl.
"Watching the way the sea-
son's been going and I'm looking
at everybody else's overall rank-
ing and everything like that, I
just have a feeling if Iowa can
win out, and we can win out, I
think there's a chance we could
make it to that January 1st Rose
Bowl game."
We know it seems far-
fetched.
But maybe Brown is getting
at something else here. What's
really promoting this mindset
that not even he can explain
convincingly?
Part of that might be the Wol-
verines' 4-0 start, and now with
five games remaining, Michigan
needs just one win to be bowl
eligible.
At this point last year, the
Wolverines could only afford
to lose one game if they wanted

to remain eligible for the post-
season.
On top of that, both of Michi-
gan's losses have been very
close, coming down to the final
play on the road. At Michigan
State, the Spartans scored a
touchdown in overtime. At
Iowa, freshman quarterback
Denard Robinson's last-minute
interception sealed the Wolver-
ines' fate.
Part of it might be Brown
getting a bit nostalgic. When he
arrived in Ann Arbor in 2006,
Michigan was in the midst of a
nine-game win streak over the
Nittany Lions, who the Wol-
verines play this weekend, and
Michigan also made the Rose
Bowl that year.
As one of just two seniors on
the defense, he could be pro-
jecting that desire to return to
Pasadena.

And part of it might be the
tightness of this group of play-
ers; it's a team that has a strange
air of invincibility for a two-loss
team.
That closeness could be seen
against Delaware State last
Saturday, when the Wolverines
got to cheer on scout-team play-
ers that never get playing'time,
such as redshirt senior Ohene
Opong-Owusu, a popular team-
mate.
"They got a big lift out of the
Big O running down there,"
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said. "It was almost like the
movie Rudy, we were yelling for
his name.... I think everybody
on the sidelines was focusing in
on him. They were excited for
him."
Throughout the season, many
players have referenced how
this year's team is much closer

than last year's. And Brown, for
one, may feel a similar camara-
derie to 2006.
But regardless of the issue,
it's not a case of Brown looking
too far ahead. Rodriguez was
confident in his team's concen-
tration on Monday.
"Again, if I sensed they were
focusing or their concentration
was not in the moment - was
further ahead - I'd rein them
in, say, 'Listen, what are you
guys thinking about?'," Rodri-
guez said.
"I don't think they wake up
thinking about the Rose Bowl or
anything further than today. At
least I hope not."
Brown may simply see some-
thing special about this team
that we just can't.

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN

The Nlichigan Dady - Wedriesdav. October 21. 2009
CIPP,

Deferring dreams for anillness

hether we like it or not,
our decisions in life are
often made because of
issues we can't control.
I had to learn this the hard way
when I didn't get to come to the
University of Michigan my fresh-
man year.
It started my senior year of high
school, when my health rapidly
deteriorated. I went from being
an active, athletic teenager to not
being able to climb a flight of stairs
without help.
The first sign of my condition
appeared when my feet seemed to
gain 10 pounds after a workout.
Within days, the swelling crept
up my legs, giving me cankles, a
tragedy for any 17-year-old. When
it was clear the problem wasn't
going away on its own, I showed
my mom.
That's when the never-end-
ing parade of visits to the doctor
began.
First I was told I had "hor-
mones" and to wait it out. When
this didn't work, I was given high

dosage Lasix, or water pills, to
flush out the excess fluid in my
legs, which was what caused the
weight gain. When Lasix didn't
work, I was given more, which
still didn't work. This continued
for over a month, with the doctor
simply telling my mom and me not
to worry so much about my mys-
tery condition. "Stop thinking this
was a zebra when it was really just
a horse," he said.
Meanwhile, I continued to dete-
riorate. Regular doses of water
pills had taken their toll on my
body. The swelling got worse, my
face turned pallid, my hair thinned
and I could never manage to keep
warm.
Watching me grow worse, my
mom became more and more insis-
tent that I see a specialist. First I
visited a cardiologist, who checked
me into the hospital and referred
me to a nephrologist, who prompt-
ly scheduled me for a kidney biopsy
and myriad other tests.
My kidney biopsy was the worst
experience of my life. Instead of

After this ordeal, we found out
the sample taken was from the
wrong part of my kidney, so I had
to have the whole procedure done

became harder and harder to do -
DUDERSTADT
From page 5C
buderstadt believes that it
important for the University to
do what it can to change its public
and state perception. At the Uni-
versity's bicentennial in 2017, he
said he hopes the celebration will
"at least get the university com-
munity and alumni to realize the
impact of this institution goes well
beyond what happens on Saturday
afternoons."
TILTING AT WINDMILLS
His vision of what higher edu-
cation should be - especially at a
place like the University of Michi-
gan - still drives the majority of
Duderstadt's current work.
Duderstadt continues to travel
the country quite frequently. He is
a sought after voice on higher edu-
cation and a popular commence-
ment speaker. Despite his North
Campus office, he admits that

like goingto school, playingsports,
driving and being with my friends.
I no longer felt like myself or even
really recognized the shell of a per-
son I had become. It was not the
senior year I'd bargained for.
Eventually, I was diagnosed
with a rare, chronic kidney disease,
which made accepting my offer to
attend the University of Michigan
out of the question.
In the end, I interviewed for a
full-tuition scholarship at a south-
ern liberal arts college, which I
attended because its small size
made getting to class from my
dorm room possible.
It was by no means easy. I had
to live in a handicapped room, my
classes were moved to the first floor
of buildings because I couldn't
climb stairs, and I was always ill -
I took up to 15 pills a day.
I grieved deeply, something I
hadn't done since I lost my dad
years earlier. I felt guilty and even
selfish for feeling the way I did
because I was only grieving for
myself - the person I used to be
and the future I had wanted. Iwent
from being someone who thought
she knew her path in life to feeling
like I was living in submission to
my health. Some kind of health-
related episode - from food poi-
most of his activities since step-
ping down as president have been
external to the University.
"I do teach and have programs
here, but my influence on higher
education or science or whatever
is not in Ann Arbor," he said. "It's
in Europe or Washington or wher-
ever I happen to be."
The number of lectures and
projects on Duderstadt's schedule
is mind-boggling, though the dry-
erase boards in his office help him
stay on top of it all. As an appro-
priate example, he is involved
in something called the "Save
the World Project." That project
involves defining what the United
States needs to do to create a sci-
entific foundation for addressing
issues like global climate change,
Duderstadt explained.
When it comes to the future
of higher education, Duderstadt
feels the nature of the University
is quickly shifting. Ten years from
now, he said, Michigan could be
enrolling hundreds of thousands

soning to meningitis - constantly
hindered my lifestyle.
Tired of wallowing in self-pity, I
joined an online support group for
people with my disease and found
a large community of support.
There, I learned that diagnosis of
my disease in someone my age is as
rare as finding a four-leaf clover -
just the kind of luck I didn't want.
With time, vigilance, medicine
and hard work, I slowly improved
and I realized what I still had
despite my ordeal. I learned to
take nothing for granted. That's
why when my health stabilized, I
set my sights on finally getting to
the University of Michigan. And
this fall, I transferred here.
After all of the extra work I put
in to get here - not academically,
but emotionally and physically -I
have a poignant appreciation of my
ability to climb the stairs to class
and attain the college education
I fiad always taken for granted. I
know the world works in mysteri-
ous ways, but sooner or later, we
all get where we're supposed to
be. A bumpy journey just makes
the destination that much more
meaningful.
-Ashlyn Gurley is a writer
for The Statement
of students per year across the
globe.
Though that may sound far-
fetched, Duderstadt cited the
example of the British Open Uni-
versity, which offers long-distance
correspondence classes, as an
emerging example. He stresses
that the core competencies of
universities may not change, but
they will be expressed differently
through "immersive technology"
and connectedness
"What kind of spontaneous
emergence will occur in a world
where everybody is connected?"
he said. "What is going to be the
new Google or the new Al-Qaida?
That's an exciting world - one that
I'm not going to be around for."
It will be up to others to figure
out how education, democracy and
intellectual humanity are shaped
in the future. But as long as he is
around, James Duderstadt contin-
ues to have the will, insight and
influence to ensure we at least
know what we're in for.

walk to parties
Ann Arbor's economical
alternatives to walking
There are so many decisions to
make before you go out at night.
What will you wear? At whose
apartmentwillyou pregame? Which
bar will you go to? How drunk will
you get?
The most important question,
though, is how you will get there. If
it's a long walk, you'll want to drive.
But if you drive, you can't drink.
And if it's cold, you'll refuseto walk
very far at all. These considerations
couldputadamperonyourweekend
- unless you know about nighttime
transportation like the BTB Cantina
Party Bus, Ann Arbor Pedicab and
the Fifth Quarter shuttle bus.
Cheaper than a cab and more
flexible than a bus schedule, these
transportation companies provide
another alternative to footing it
across campus.
The blazing red BTB Party Bus
couldn't have a better slogan than
what is printed on its front, "$2
Rides." It rumbles along, picking
up people on the street or respond-
ing to reservation calls, and you
never know who or what you might
encounter on the taxi-bus hybrid.

While boarding the bus, the
potent smell of fryer grease makes
BTB's use of vegetable oil as alterna-
tive fuel obvious. But environmen-
tal conscientiousness isn't the main
reason students hail the Party Bus.
Rides are often rowdy and always
cheap - a long trip within the Ann
Arbor city limits costs $4 at most.
"We are sort of rickety and bois-
terous and that gives us character
that students love," BTB Party Bus
driver Gabe Jones said.
Riding on the bus is an experi-
ence in itself, as I found when I
rode the bus last Thursday. By the
time students get on the bus, they
are usually somewhat inebriated, so
the clientele often has an "anything
goes" attitude.
"You're supposed to be seated the
whole ride, but one time I was on
the bus, people were dancing and
humping one another," LSA junior
-Joshua Yim said.
But the Party Bus can be just as
difficult to snag as a cab if you don't
make a reservation ahead of time.
Luckily, though, other operations
have sprung up to fill the niche for
alternative transportation.
Fifth Quarter, Ann Arbor's new-
est'Tuesday night freshman des-
tination, launched its own shuttle
bus this past Welcome Week, which
is available Thursday through
Saturday after 10 p.m.. Painted a
drab brown and featuring only one

comfortable couch, Fifth Quarter's
minibus isn't as cheery as the BTB
Party Bus. But it offers a similarly
enticing deal: rides to Fifth Quarter
are free, while anywhere else with-
in a 10-mile radius of the club will
cost you $2.
But the Fifth Quarter bus seems
to lack the party atmosphere of
BTB transport. When I rode the bus
last Thursday, there were only two
other people, which combined with
the absence of music, made for an
awkward silence. The Bursley-Bates
bus gets wilder than that. Of course,
if your destination is Fifth Quarter,
tflis shuttle bus is your best option
since it's free.
Your next alternative transit
option is pedicabs, or tricycles tot-
ing hooded seats. Business sopho-
more Calvin Schemanski started a
pedicab business in Ann Arbor this
semester after a successful test run
during the summer in his home-
town of Petoskey, Mich.
"My partner and I decided to
make a business out of the tourist
appeal of our city (Petoskey) and I
decided to bring it here because I
felt it would be successful," he said.
There are two pedicabs that roam

If hauntings are your guilty pleasure, "Ann Arbor Area Ghosts" is

few, drugs took precedent to tragic b
results.r
One 15-year-old girl learned thats

but not from her own abuse of drugsa
or even that of anyone living. Whilev
visiting some older guys who lived I
in the house, the girl passed on an i
offer to smoke weed. But despite
being completely sober, she soonc
had the trip of her life.r
Feeling a "strange, bone-chillinge
cold," the girl went upstairs alonea
in an attempt to warm up. But shec
was petrified with fear when ac
wall seemed to start moving and
an inexplicable black shadows made
its way toward her. Downstairs,r

enced the same spine-tingling fright.
The first incident occurred in
January 2005, when the guest stu-
dent walked into his bedroom late at
night to see a filmy apparition of an
older man gasping for air on the bed.
In January of the next year, anoth-
er Japanese student had a similar
encounter in the same room. The two
students never met and did not know
about their shared experiences.
Lying in bed late at night, the stu-
dent saw a strange green glow out her

When the girl came downstairs,
a detailed vision of a man's face
came to her.
The others did not see the face,
but they did hear the astounding
message the girl delivered as if pos-
sessed by another force: "The drugs
and addiction were my fault, and I
accept responsibility for that, but I
was not that way deep down inside.
I want to apologize to everyone
nvolved for what I had done."
After the girl came to and
described what she saw, the house-
mates explained that a few weeks
earlier, before they had moved in,
a previous resident matching her
description had died from a heroin
overdose. He had fallen into heavy
drug use in the months before his
death, which had led him to destroy
relationships with erratic, threat-
ening behavior. He had beat his
girlfriend and once pulled a gun on
her when he became paranoid that
she was cheating on him.

she heard someone wheezing and
felt a figure lying aside her in the
bed. When she opened her eyes
she saw the same suffering older
man. The apparition disappeared,
butlaterthatnight the studentsaw
the face of a woman with long hair
on the bedroom wall and heard
the shower run when no one was
in it.
The students' housemother
said the apparition described
seemed like the man the she had
purchased the house from in
2003. The author of "Ann Arbor
Area Ghosts," Mimi Uptergrove,
researched the original owner
and found out he had died from an
asthma attack shortly after mov-
ing out of the house. Uptergrove
speculates in her book that the
man's energy might have left an
imprint on the room from a time
when he experienced poignant
suffering, such as a past asthma
attack. The sounds of the shower
might have been an echo of the
steam remedy the asthmatic man
might have tried, she wrote.

one of the iPhone's most impres-

It's the Republicans in Congress

mock app can perform. Needless to
say, some left-leaning iPhone custom-

by this partisan app. On the other
hand, it could be useful for fans of
U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, who is featured
in this video.

STUDY OF THE WEEK
Salads are most likely to cause foodborne illness
Leafy greens, eggs and tuna are the three most dangerous foods
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, according to a study
released by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI).
The study, which used data from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, ranked the 10 foods regulated by the FDA that have
caused the most foodborne illnesses. Meat products were not includ-
ed in the study because they do not fall under the FDA's purview,
which includes all produce, dairy products, shell eggs and seafood.
The researchers concluded that in the past 20 years, there have
been 363 outbreaks and 13,568 cases of illness stemming from leafy
greens. During the same time period, eggs reportedly caused 352 out-
breaks and tuna caused 268 outbreaks. The researchers said that ill-
nesses could include a minor problem like diarrhea or stomach pains,
but it could also mean kidney failure or death.
Other "risky" foods include cheese, ice cream and berries.

During his tenure, former University President James Duderstadt promoted the
University's most liberal policies. In retirement, he continues to fight the good fight.
Here's how he came to take up the bullhorn.

world inwhich the pace of knowledge continues
to accelerate and where you're one paycheck away
from the unemployment line, unless you're willing
to continue to prove your skills."
Duderstadt, who served from 1988 to 1996 as
the 11th president of the University, is knowledge-
able about more than just higher education. He is
a veritable giant of policy - and philosophy - on
an array of topics, including energy policy and the
Michigan economy. He is also a theoretical physi-.
cist and nuclear engineer by trade.
Thirteen years after his retirement from the
presidency, Duderstadt maintains an office on
North Campus in the building that bears his name.
He rose into a leadership position because he
wanted to get things done - and he stepped down
when the job was finished.
Though much is often made of his retirement
and unlikely return to the College of Engineering
faculty, Duderstadt maintains that there's nothing
so mysterious about his decisions. He was a change
agent who pushed the envelope, never thinking
about whether it might hurt his chances at taking
another presidency at a more elite institution.
"I burned a lot of bridges," he said with a soft
chuckle, reflecting on some of the unpopular deci-
sions he made. "But once in a while, you have to do
things like that."'
THE BOY WHO THOUGHT YALE
WAS IN ENGLAND
Born in Carrollton, Mo. in 1943, Duderstadt
was just the second person ever from his town to
take the SAT. Passing on the usual career paths
for rural Missouri boys in the 1950s ("agriculture,
maybe dentistry"), Duderstadt's parents encour-
aged him to apply to faraway schools - some of
which were actually closer than he thought.
"I applied to places like Stanford and Michi-
gan, and Yale and Harvard - which I thought at
the time were in England," he said.
Sight unseen, the young Duderstadt headed
to Yale, with the promise of playing football for
the Bulldogs the deciding factor. A culture shock
was inevitable, but that didn't make it any easi-
er. Initially, Duderstadt carried a B average and
struggled to fit in with his Andover and Exeter-
prepped classmates.
But just as he would later in life, Duderstadt
adapted quickly - raising his grades and taking
on electrical engineering as his major because, as
he describes in his memoir "The View From the
Helm," it was "the hardest engineering major so I
reasoned it had to be worthwhile."
From there, it was the Cold War and the noto-
rious '60s that shaped his career.
"A lot of things were happening," Duderstadt
said in September. "Martin Luther King was the

said, presidents are snapedby tneinstitution and
time in which they serve.
"Institutions are much more influential in
shaping the president than the president is in
shaping the institution," he said. "These are big,
powerful organizations that have lasted a very
long time. The ultimate responsibility of a presi-
dent is to the institution, and through that, to the
various constituencies that it serves - students,
states, the nation and the world."
Asked what a University president could or
should do to oppose public impositions such.as
the ban on affirmative action, Duderstadt admits
that there isn't always much to be done - with
one exception.
"You have to speak out," Duderstadt said. "But
the difficulty today is that the voice of the presi-
dent is not nearly as loud or highly regarded or
heard as it might have been at earlier times. As
president, -you always have a lot of responsibili-
ties. Some things are important enough - I felt
diversity was - that you simply have to be a very
powerful voice for it."
Regardless, pressures from the government,
students, donors and alumni are intense. Duder-
stadt, speaking of each in turn, was most appre-
ciative ofthe influence students have traditionally
exerted, especially in Ann Arbor. He admitted
it can be a "headache" when students disrupt
administration meetings or barge in on the presi-
dent's office, but he still feels student activism
is a positive influence on the University, such as
when students pushed for the Michigan Man-
date, a University agenda to make racial diversity
on campus mirror national and statewide demo-
graphics.
"We would not have done that had it not been
for the students who pounded on the desks and
got our attention," Duderstadt said.
But Duderstadt believes that students today
just aren't as involved as they used to be and
feels the University is lacking student energy and
engagement on issues.
Student energy is rarely low when it comes
to Michigan athletics, though. And even though
Duderstadt was at the helm of the University
through several Rose Bowls and Final Fours, he
is very critical of the role of athletics on college
campuses.
"I think (athletics) just distorts the American
perspective of what universities are all about," he
said. "I am also deeply worried about the degree
to which it exploits young people.
"We've found that most of the student-athletes
that come to the University of Michigan come
with the same academic objectives as all of our
students. And the factthat a significant number of
them don't finish and gettheir degree here - and
don't have life afterward in terms of athletics -
means they've been exploited to benefit coaches
and institutions. And that's wrong."

speaker at my commencement. (President) Ken-
nedy was assassinated in my senior year. The
Space Race was off and running. I was interested
in the space program, went to Caltech and then
got involved in the nuclear area, which seemed
like a hot area at the time."
After a stint after graduation in Los Alam-
os, N.M., to work on nuclear-powered rockets
intended for manned missions to Mars, Duder-
stadt intended to settle down in California. But
his wife, Anne, had other ideas. "Having grown
weary of the smog and traffic of Southern Cali-
fornia," Duderstadt recalled, she accepted on his
behalf an offer made by the College of Engineer-
ing at the University of Michigan in faraway Ann
Arbor.
"THE PRESIDENCY SWUNG TO ME"
Duderstadt arrived in Ann Arbor in 1968, and
didn't take long to make his mark.
"I went through the normal process of doing
research and teaching and found myself more and
more involved in university politics," Duderstadt

said. "I was on (the Senate Assembly), and in 1980
was surprised when the provost called and asked
if I'd be dean of engineering. I was 36."
As dean of the College of Engineering, Duder-
stadt began the type of work that would come to
define his 40 years at Michigan. He was known
for restructuring the school, making improve-
ments and advancing the department to prepare
for a new age in education.
Duderstadt himself puts it more bluntly.
"I had changed the College of Engineering so
much thatI feltI wasn't the appropriate person to
serve more than five years," he said. "They need-
ed someone to come in after me and let it heal a
little bit."
Promoted to provost in 1986, Duderstadt
became the first person from the College of Engi-
neering to gain a senior administration position.
Then-University President Harold Shapiro may
have already had in mind an even higher position
for Duderstadt. Shapiro left the following year
to become the Princeton University president,
which left Duderstadt as the only internal candi-

date for the Michigan job.
"Not that I was interested in it, but that's
where I found myself," Duderstadt clarified. "And
through a variety of things that happened, the
presidency swung to me."
Duderstadt was in many ways the first modern
presidentofthe University.Hetalked aboutissues
like diversity and repositioningthe University for
the digital age - ideas that have become main-
stays of the University's identity today - at a time
when these were still novel, untested ideals.
His focus on diversity was multi-faceted, suc-
cessful and largely applauded even by his harsh-
est critics - The Michigan Daily's editorial
page among them. Two of his pet projects, the
Michigan Mandate and the Michigan Agenda
for Women, improved racial and gender diversity
among the University faculty. His later move to
extend benefits to same-sex partners of Univer-
sity employees was also successful, though much
more controversial.
"I came under enormous heat when I extended
the concept of diversity to include sexual orien-

tation," he said. "(Former Michigan Gov. John
Engler) tried to pack our Board of Regents with
people that were hostile to that and to me. I lost a
lot of support, but it was the rightthing to do."
Another product of Duderstadt's tenure was
the improvement of campus facilities. In a 1996
editorial reflecting on his presidency, the Daily
said that Duderstadt's greatest legacy might as
well have been turning the Diag into a perpetual
construction zone. But from that age of change
emerged a fully rebuilt campus that students and
faculty could be proud of.
Duderstadt said the University's strong credit
rating and the weak economy made it the right
time to rebuild the campus. Nevertheless, there
were critics, from students frustrated by detours
to state officials who criticized money spent on
construction. anywhere besides the revenue-
reaping Michigan Stadium.
Perhaps the reason Duderstadt has been able
to embrace the controversy and fallout of such
unpopular decisions so easily is because he takes
a much broader, idealistic view of the role of a
