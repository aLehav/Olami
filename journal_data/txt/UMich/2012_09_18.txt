Board to also vote
on MRI machine,

By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
Though the renovation of East
Quad Residence Hall is only just
underway, the University's Board
of Regents is slated to vote on a $60
million renovation to South Quad
Residence Hall at its meeting on
Thursday.
In their first meeting of the aca-
demic year, the regents will also
be discussing a proposal for a new
MRI machine within the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System
and renovations on elevators in
the Modern Language Building, in
additionto infrastructureupgrades
at the Willard H. Dow Laboratory.
Built in 1951, South Quad is the
current home of many student ath-
letes and the University's Honors
Program. Though renovations to
the structure will be extensive, the

changes won'tbe quite asoverarch-
ing as thoseto other residence halls.
According to a communication to
the regents written by Timothy
Slottow, the University's executive
vice president and chief financial
officer, less than one-third of the
building's 390,000 square feet will
be affected by the project.
Slottow wrote that the renova-
tion would impact about 106,700
square feet for expansion of the
dining hall and renovation of rest-
rooms throughout the building.
The plans also call for the reorga-
nization ofsome community spaces
and the addition of study spots,
music practice rooms and modern-
ized lounges.
He also wrote that the plan
would include new heating and
cooling systems, fire suppression
systems and improved wireless
Internet access. If approved, the
project will be funded by Univer-
sity Housing's budget.
Slottow did not indicate a pro-
jected start date for the project. If
the motion to consider the renova-
tions is approved by the regents, it
will allow the University to begin

Trial of Chinese police chief

Wang Lijun charged
with corruption,
abuse of power
CHENGDU, China (AP) - A
once-prominent police chief at
the center of a divisive political
scandal stood trial for a second
day Tuesday as Chinese leaders
moved closer to resolving a case
that has complicated their trans-
fer of power to new leaders.
The Intermediate Court in
the central city of Chengdu
resumed the hearing for Wang
Lijun focusing on corruption and
other charges, and was expected
to end the trial later Tuesday.
The proceedings unexpectedly
opened a day early Monday with
an unannounced closed-door
hearing that Wang's lawyer
said involved state secrets and
explored charges of defecting
and abuse of power - allega-
tions related to his surprise visit
to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu
in February that triggered the
scandal.
Police stationed around the
courthouse pulled tape across
the entrance and blocked and
rerouted traffic, in part to deter
spectators or people with griev-
ances against the government
or Wang. Police led away a cou-
ple and an older man who tried
to speak with foreign report-
ers, who were restricted to a
sidewalk across from the court
entrance. Unidentified men
filmed the reporters.
The trial was the latest wrin-
kle in the bizarre months-long
scandal that started with Wang's
flight to the consulate, where he
divulged that a British business-
man found dead in November
had been murdered. In the fall-
out, Wang's boss, senior politi-
cian Bo Xilai, was ousted from
the communist leadership, Bo's
wife confessed to the murder
and the Communist Party lead-
ership had to manage the dam-
age while trying to negotiate a
delicate power handover to a
younger generation.

Wang's trial clears the way for
the leadership to deal with the
scandal's stickiest issue: wheth-
er to expel Bo from the party
and prosecute him. Proof that
the damage-control continues to
vex Chinese leaders is that they
have yet to announce a date for a
party congress to install the new
leadership, though it is expected
in mid- to late October.
By using a closed-door hear-
ing, authorities could limit leaks
about Bo's involvement in the
cover-up of the murder of the
British businessman Neil Hey-
wood, an associate of the Bo
family, and about any outbursts
by Wang.
"Wang Lijun, by walking into
the U.S. consulate, showed that
he does not play by the book. It
was a surprise move to Bo and
to the party. He might not be as
easy to control," said Dali Yang,
director of the University of Chi-
cago Center in Beijing.
Wang's almost certain con-
viction marks the downfall of a
prominent, colorful police chief
H-M

who often skirted the law he
made a show of enforcing.
A policeman for more than
two decades, Wang made a name
for himself as a gang-buster in
a northeastern province. There
he met Bo, then a fast-rising
politician who, as the son of a
revolutionary veteran, had a web
of political contacts. The two
rode to national fame together,
launching a high-profile sweep
against organized crime in
Chongqing, an inland megacity
where Bo was named party chief
in 2007.
In magazine cover stories and
on television news, Wang was
depicted as someone willing to
tackle vested interests. Hun-
dreds of gangsters, police and
officials were prosecuted,'and
among the 13 people executed
was the head of the city's justice
bureau. Behind the headlines,
the use of torture to extract
confessions and arrests to pres-
sure businessmen to steer deals
toward Bo and his allies created
enemies at the highest levels.

Male cosmetics
sales expected to
top $885 million
this year
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
Cho Won-hyuk stands in front of
his bedroom mirror and spreads
dollops of yellow-brown makeup
over his forehead, nose, chin and
cheeks until his skin is flawless.
Then he goes to work with ablack
pencil, highlighting his eyebrows
until they're thicker, bolder.
"Having a clean, neat face
makes you look sophisticated
and creates an image that you
can handle yourself well," the
24-year-old college student said.
"Your appearance matters, so
when I wear makeup on special
occasions, it makes me more
confident."
Cho's meticulous efforts
to paint the perfect face are
not unusual in South Korea.
This socially conservative,

male-dominated country, with
a mandatory two-year mili-
tary conscription for men, has
become the male makeup capital
of the world.
South Korean men spent
$495.5 million on skincare last
year, accounting for nearly 21
percent of global sales, accord-
ing to global market research
firm Euromonitor International.
That makes it the largest market
for men's skincare in the world,
even though there are only about
19 million men in South Korea.
Amorepacific, South Korea's
biggest cosmetics company, esti-
mates the total sales of men's cos-
metics in South Korea this year
will be more than $885 million.
The metamorphosis of South
Korean men from macho to
makeup over the last decade
or so can be partly explained
by fierce competition for jobs,
advancement and romance in
a society where, as a popular
catchphrase puts it, "appearance
is power." Women also have a
growing expectation that men

will take the time and effort to
pamper their skin.
Evidence of this new direc-
tion in South Korean masculin-
ity is easy to find. In a crowded
Seoul cafe, a young woman takes-
some lipstick out of her purse
and casually applies it to her
male companion's lips as they
talk. At an upscale apartment
building, a male security guard
watches the lobby from behind
a layer of makeup. Korean Air
holds annual male makeup class-
es for its staff at Incheon Inter-
national Airport.
"I can understand why girls
don't like to go outside without
makeup - it makes a big differ-
ence," said Cho Gil-nam, a tall,
stocky 27-year-old insurance
fraud investigator in Seoul who
starts important days by dab-
bing on makeup after finishing
his multistep morning cleans-
ing and moisturizing routine. He
carries a multicolored cosmet-
ics pouch so he can touch up in
public bathrooms throughout
the day.

Detroit police start
12-hour shifts
Police officers in Detroit are
beginning new, 12-hour shifts as
part of the department's efforts to
cut overtime and save cash.
The shifts start Monday and
will see officers work two weeks
and have the next 14 days off.
A judge ruled last month that
Mayor Dave Bing could institute
the new shifts and a 10-percent
pay cut to police. The $75 million
in police pay cuts is designed to
help the city cut into abudget def-
icit that once stood at more than
$300 million.
Other city workers also have
taken pay cuts.

French court to

Lawyers for Prince William

publication of topless photos of

intimate moment caught by the
snap of an intruding photogra-
pher - images that ended up last
week in a popular French gossip
magazine, then in publications in
two other countries.
The court in Nanterre, outside
Paris, said it would announce its
ruling at noon Tuesday on the
request to stop Closer from repro-
ducing the images. The magazine
published 14 of the images of a
partially clad Kate in its pages
on Friday. On Monday, an Italian
magazine, Chi, Chi published a
26-page spread of the photos of
Kate.. Chi, like Closer, is part of

BEIRUT, Lebanon
Hezbollah leads
massive anti-U.S.
protest in Lebanon
In a rare public appearance,
the leader of the militant Hezbol-
lah group exhorted hundreds of
thousands of supporters Monday
to keep up the campaign against
an anti-Islam video that has
unleashed deadly violence and
anger at the United States across
the Muslim world.
Although the massive, well-
organized rally in Beirut was
peaceful, protesters in Afghani-
stan set fires near a U.S. mili-
tary base, clashed with police in
Pakistan, where one demonstra-
tor was killed, and battled with
officers outside the U.S. Embassy
in Jakarta, Indonesia, the world's
most populous Muslim country.
The turmoil surrounding the
low-budget video that mocks the
Prophet Muhammad showed
no sign of ebbing in the week
after protesters first swarmed
the walls of the U.S. Embassy in
Cairo. Four Americans, includ-
ing the U.S. ambassador to Libya,
died amid a demonstration in the
eastern Libyan city of Benghazi.

Group took
ambassador to
hospital after
consulate attack
CAIRO (AP) - Libyans
tried to rescue Ambassador
Chris Stevens, cheering "God
is great" and rushing him to a
hospital after they discovered
him still clinging to life inside
the U.S. Consulate, according
to witnesses and a new video
that emerged Monday from
last week's attack in the city of
Benghazi.
The group of Libyans had
stumbled across Stevens' seem-
ingly lifeless form inside a dark
room and didn't know who he
was, only that he was a foreign-
er, the man who shot the video
and two other witnesses told
The Associated Press.
The account underlines the
confusion that reigned dur-
ing the assault by protesters
and heavily armed gunmen
that overwhelmed the consul-
ate in Benghazi last Tuesday
night, killing four Americans,
including Stevens, who died
from smoke inhalation soon
after he was found. U.S. offi-
cials are still trying to piece
together how the top American
diplomat in Libya got separat-
ed from others as staffers were
evacuated, suffocating in what
is believed to be a consulate
safe-room.
The Libyans who found him
expressed frustration that
there was no ambulance and no
first aid on hand, leaving him to
be slung over a man's shoulder
to be carried to a car.
"There was not a single
ambulance to carry him.
Maybe he was handled the
wrong way," said Fahd al-Bak-
oush, a freelance videographer
who shot the footage. "They
took him to a private car."
U.S. and Libyan officials are
also trying to determine who

was behind the attack. Still
unclear was whether it had
been planned beforehand or
was sparked by an anti-Islam
film made in the United States
that, hours before the Beng-
hazi assault, had sparked pro-
tests at the American Embassy
in Cairo.
On Sunday, Libyan President
Mohammed el-Megarif con-
tended foreign militants had
been plotting the attack for
months and timed it for Tues-
day's 9/11 anniversary.
However, U.S. Ambassa-
dor to the U.N. Susan Rice
said it appeared spontaneous
and unplanned, that extrem-
ists with heavier weapons
"hijacked" the protest and
turned it into an outright
attack. She noted Libya is.
awash with weapons.
A CIA memo sent to U.S.
lawmakers this weekend, and
obtained by The Associated
Press, says current intelligence
still suggests the demonstra-
tions in Benghazi "were spon-
taneously inspired by the
protests at the U.S. Embassy
in Cairo" and "evolved into a
direct assault" on the diplo-
matic posts by "extremists."
Soon after the attack, Libyan
civilians roamed freely around
the trashed consulate, its walls
blacked and furniture burned.
Among them were the videog-
rapher al-Bakoush, and a pho-
tographer and art student he
often works with.
They heard a panicked
shout, "I stepped over a dead
man," and rushed to see what
was going on, al-Bakoush said.
The body hadbeen found inside
a dark room with a locked door
accessible only by a window. A
group of men pulled him out
and realized he was a foreigner
and still alive.
He was breathing and his
eyelids flickered, al-Bakoush
said. "He was alive," he said.
"No doubt. His face was black-
ened and he was like a para-
lyzed person."

GOP candidate
claims 47 percent
of Americans
aren't his problem
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Already scrambling to steady
a struggling campaign, Repub-
lican Mitt Romney confronted
a new headache Monday after
a video surfaced showing him
telling wealthy donors that
almost half of all Americans
"believe they are victims" enti-
tled to extensive government
support. He added that as a
candidate for the White House,
"my job is not to worry about
those people."
At a hastily called news con-
ference late in the day, Rom-
ney conceded the comments
weren't "elegantly stated" and
that they were spoken "off the
cuff."
President Barack Obama's
campaign quickly seized on the
video, obtained by the maga-
zine Mother Jones and made
public on a day that Romney's
campaign said it needed a
change in campaign strategy
to gain momentum in the presi-
dential race. Romney aides
were already working behind
the scenes to calm dissension
in the GOP ranks and reassure
nervous donors and consultants
about the state of a race some
Republicans worry may be get-
ting away from their nominee.
"There are 47 percent of the
people who will vote for the
president -no matter what,"
Romney is shown saying in
a video posted online by the
magazine. "There are 47 per-
cent who are with him, who are
dependent upon government,

who believe that they are vic-
tims, who believe that govern-
ment has a responsibility to
care for them, who believe that
they are entitled to health care,
to food, to housing, to you name
it."
"Forty-seven percent of
Americans pay no income tax,"
Romney said.
Romney said in the video
that his role "is not to worry
about those people. I'll never
convince them they should take
personal responsibility and
care for their lives."
In his remarks to reporters
before a fundraiser Monday
night in Costa Mesa, Calif.,
Romney did not dispute the
authenticity of the hidden-
camera footage, but he called
for the release of the full video,
instead of the clips posted
online. He sought to clarify his
remarks but did not apologize.
"It's not elegantly stated, let
me put it that way. I was speak-
ing off the cuff in response'
to a question. And I'm sure I
could state it more clearly in a
more effective way than I did
in a setting like that," Romney
said. "Of course I want to help
all Americans. All Americans
have a bright and prosperous
future."
About 46 percent of Ameri-
cans owed no federal income
tax in 2011, although many
of them paid other forms of
taxes. More than 16 million
elderly Americans avoid federal
income taxes solely because of
tax breaks that apply only to
seniors, according to the non-
partisan Tax Policy Center.
Obama's campaign called the
video "shocking"
"It's hard to serve as presi-
dent for all Americans when
you've disdainfully written off

half the nation," Obama cam-
paign manager Jim Messina
said in a statement.
An Obama adviser said the
Democratic campaign might
use Romney's comments from
the fundraising video in tele-
vision advertisements. The
official wasn't authorized to
discuss campaign strategy pub-
licly and requested anonymity.
Romney's 2010 federal tax
returns show he paid a tax
rate of about 14 percent on an
annual income of $21 million.
The vast majority of his income
came from investments, which
are taxed at a lower rate than
wages. His wealth has been
estimated as high as $250 mil-
lion.
Democrats have tried to
make an issue of what Rom-
ney pays in taxes and what he
is willing to divulge about his
taxes and investments. While
he has released his 2010 tax
returns and a summary of his
2011 returns, he has rejected
calls for releasing as many as 10
years of tax returns. His cam-
paign has pledged to release his
complete 2011 returns before
the election Nov. 6.
The private remarks are the
latest in a string of comments
from the multimillionaire
Republican businessman whom
Democrats have criticized as
out of touch. During the prima-
ry campaign, Romney insisted
that he was "not concerned"
about the very poor, said he
knew what it felt like to worry
about being "pink-slipped,"
and said that his wife drove
a "couple of Cadillacs." Aides
to Obama's campaign said the
latest video would help them
continue to make the case that
Romney doesn't understand the
concerns of average Americans.

180 protesters incarcerated on
Occupy Wall Street anniversary

Occupiers take

i

to the streets in
NYC's financial
district
NEW YORK (AP) - Occupy
Wall Street protesters celebrat-
ed the movement's anniversary
on Monday by clogging inter-
sections in the city's financial
district, marching to the beat
of drums that were a familiar
refrain last year.
Protesters roamed around
the lower Manhattan financial
district all morning in groups
of a few dozen each, from one
intersection to another and
back again, chanting loudly
about the ills of Wall Street. In
total, there were a few hundred
protesters scattered through-
out the city. More than 180 of
them were arrested by early
Monday evening, mostly on dis-
orderly conduct charges.
The day's events lacked the
heft of Occupy protests last
year, when protesters gath-
ered by the thousands. But
Occupiers were upbeat as they
spread out in their old stomping

grounds, giddy at the prospect
of being together again. They
brushed off any suggestions
that the movement had petered
out.
"This is a movement. It's
only been a year," said protester
Justin Stone Diaz, of Brooklyn.
"It's going to take many years
for it to develop and figure out
exactly who we are."
But the movement is now a
shadow of its mighty infancy,
when a group of young people
harnessed the power of a disil-
lusioned nation and took to the
streets chanting about corpo-
rate greed and inequality.
A familiar Statue of Liberty
puppet was back, bobbing in
the crowd above protesters'
heads. Protesters in wheel-
chairs blocked a road and
chanted "All day, all week,
occupy Wall Street!" before
they were steered off the road
by police.
Zuccotti Park, the former
home of the encampment, was
encircled by metal police barri-
cades lined with police officers
standing watch.
Hamza Sinanaj, a 30-year-
old airplane mechanic who
works in upstate New York as

a security guard, said he was
among the first Occupy pro-
testers last September.
"I felt that protest was long
overdue, and I'm back today,"
he said, holding up a sign that
read, "America Rise Up."
He was staying at his sister's
home in the Bronx but wasn't
sure he'd be there Monday
night because he was "ready to
be arrested, to sit on the street
and be arrested."
Events were planned in more
than 30 cities worldwide.
In San Francisco, local Occu-
py groups planned to occupy 10
banks across the city and then
hold an evening rally honor-
ing foreclosure fighters, people
who've been helping residents
stave off foreclosures by squat-
ting or holding sit-ins, outside
the Bank of America building in
the Financial District, the site
of previous protests. They then
planned to march.
Last year, hundreds of pro-
testers camped out for weeks
at Justin Herman Plaza across
from the city's Ferry Building,
a magnet for tourists and in the
heart of the Financial District,
where nearby businesses were
affected.

FROM THE DAILY
Infor m to protect
The 'U' needs to advertise medical amnesty
n May 8, Gov. Rick Snyder signed into law House Bill 4393,
finally puttingminplace a state-wide medical amnesty bill
that puts health and safety first. Under the new law, under-
age people seeking medical attention while under the influence of
alcohol are shielded from legal punishment when they call for help
and receive treatment for themselves or others. The medical amnesty
laws have the potential to save lives, especially on college campuses.
The law was passed more than four months ago, and yet many stu-
dents outside of University housing are still unaware of it. The Uni-
versity needs to make it a priority to educate and inform all students
about the changes in Michigan law, not just incoming freshmen.

NOTABLE QUOTABLE
There are 47 percent who are with [Barack

y friend, after an
unlucky turn of events,
got stuck living in
North Quad for
her junior year
of college. She's
happily housed
in a single,
though subject-
ed to freshmen
and sopho-
mores on a daily
basis. ADRIENNE
After a few ROBERTS
days of living
in this dreaded
teenage-infested environment, she
said, "I can't take this; there are
actual people knocking on my door
... wanting to talk and be my friend.
It's awful."
That would have been me a few
years ago, eagerly chatting with
whomever's door was open about
my hometown or the size of my
graduating class. Thinking about
doing that now sounds unimagi-
nable, and a little bit awful, too. For
some reason, past freshmen year,
this type of conversation seems a
little bit odd.
Interestingly enough, I used to
make fun of my parents for not hav-
ingenough friends. I stillsometimes
do. It always seemed that they were
fine with just hanging out with each
other. But that scenario isn't too far
removed from my days spent in the
back of lecture halls and studying
in a corner of the Law Library. It's
a scary thought.
This summer I read an article in
The New York Times, "Friends of a
Certain Age," and immediately for-
warded it to my parents, amazed at
how perfectly this described them.
They were just too old to make new
friends. They have jobs to worry

about and a house to maintain. It's
just not feasible for them to make
new connections at this point.
Making and keeping friends is an
entirely different, and supposedly
more difficult, process for them
than it is for people my age.
I worked the entire summer, and
some days as I stared at the comput-
er screen for the seventh straight
hour, I could feel myself getting
old and friendless. I'd come home
from work exhausted, say "hello"
to my roommates and then turn on
a rerun of "Seinfeld" and rest my
eyes. At 7 p.m.
I started school this year a little
nervous about how my social life
would change upon graduation. It
felt as if during the summer months
I'd been losing contact with old
friends. Reading this article had
entirely convinced me that friend-
ships will die out, and it will only
become more and more difficult to
meet close friends.
I think that it's true that many
friends you thought you'd be close
with forever will become busier,
move away and have lives that go
in completely different directions
than yours. It's like there's a weed-
ing out of friendships that begins in
college. But that doesn't necessarily
mean that you can't make new ones.
I've lost contact with some friends
over the years, but the ones I want
to be in my life are. And the same
goes for other college students I
know, and my parents as well.
However, I'm simultaneously
making new friends. The people
who I worked with this summer
were some of my closest friends. It's
hard not to be close with the people
you spend a majority of your time
with. And I know I'll stay ir contact
with them, even though I won't see

them every day.
The author of the Times article,
Alex Williams, states in an inter-
view with National Public Radio
that sociologists have settled on
three conditions to make close
friends: proximity, repeated inter-
actions and a setting that "encour-
ages people to let their guard
down." He then goes on to say that
college is the perfect setting for
this.
Friendships
change with
age, but their
meaning doesn't.
Williams is right, but I would
argue that he thinks about what
defines a "close" friend too nar-
rowly. The way we make friends
changes greatly throughout our
lives. It's even changed throughout
college. But I think it's possible to
form connections, and meaningful
ones at that, at any age.
Age is not the problem here.
Friendships do change with age,
but their meaning does not.
It's apparent that how we estab-
lish friendships and the ongoing
nature of them changes as we move
down the road of life. Right now, I
am enjoying that "perfect friend-
ship environment." But that still
doesn't mean I'm willing to relocate
to North Quad and spend my time
trick-or-treating for friends.

The University has taken some steps to edu-
cate new students on medical amnesty. This
summer, it worked to familiarize incoming
freshmen with what the amnesty law means
for them. At summer orientation sessions, Uni-
versity Department of Public Safety officers
discussed the standards that the new law puts
in place, letting students know what happens
when they call in for alcohol-related emergen-
cies. Legal changes were also reflected in this
year's AlcoholEdu course - the online alco-
hol education seminar incoming students are
required to complete. However, many Univer-
sity upperclassmen are unaware of the medi-
cal amnesty law. Housing directors recently
began telling resident advisors to include
information about medical amnesty laws in
hall e-mails in an attempt to spread the word
to those living in dorms.
The University's effort to inform students
of this potentially life-saving law, however,
has not extended to upperclassmen living off-
campus. It has been four months since the law
was passed, but the 'U' hasn't sent an e-mail
to the student body outlining the changes in
Michigan's law. There hasn't been any formal
reminders from the University or DPS.
Since the beginning of September, Univer-
sity students partook in Welcome Week and

home football games, both of which are noto-
rious for excessive drinking. Yet many stu-
dents aren't aware of the new safety measures
under the law. Given that at least 1,400 college
students' deaths a year are linked to alcohol,
allowing even one student to remain ignorant
of the law's changes is unacceptable.
The changes created by the amnesty law
are too closely tied to the health of students
to be tossed aside as common knowledge. Any
assumptions made by the administration in
the belief that its students have been educated
by outside sources are dangerously inaccurate.
While the University should be doing more
to advertise the amnesty law in order to pro-
vide students with the proper facts and eradi-
cate misinterpretations, students share that
responsibility.
The 'U' can easily spread the word by dis-
tributing informational flyers or sending mass
e-mails, but no consistent effort has been
observed. In the years to come, University
administration needs to nail down a system
that reaches and educates everyone at the.Uni-
versity, regardless of year, age or geographical
location. The University has the responsibil-
ity to combat issues related to health, protec-
tion and safety of its students, and when these
efforts fall short, it puts every student at risk.

SHARIK BASHIRI VIEWPOINT
The two faces of America

This pastcsummer I was out with my friends
in the downtown area of Karachi, Pakistan
known as Saddar. While driving, I noticed
some political graffiti on a wall. Someone
had sprayed the slogan "go America go." This
slogan may be misunderstood as one that is
meant to cheer on American effort in the War
on Terror. However, it was an anti-America
slogan demanding that the United States leave
Pakistan and discontinue its presence in my
home country's northern areas. I immediately
dismissed the graffiti as extremist right-wing
rhetoric and continued driving.
But the graffiti's message stuck with me. I.
thought about how Pakistanis view the Unit-
ed States and the accuracy of their percep-
tions. Although that slogan doesn't speak for
all of Pakistan, surely anti-U.S. sentiment has
been on the rise.
Over the past year I've lived in the United
States and seen a side of this country that
the majority of Pakistanis probably haven't.
I believe ignorance contributes to why peo-
ple in Pakistan are so critical of America.
Instead of fervently criticizing the country,
Pakistan should learn from America's his-
tory - a history that is rife with political
and social activism for domestic and inter-
national matters alike.
Nothing was handed to the American peo-
ple on a silver platter. Every right was hard-
earned and contested, from ending segregation
to grantingwomenthe righttovote. Pakistanis
have to learn to do the same. In my opinion,
misinformation and alack of insight leads peo-
ple to create a monstrous image of America.
I later understood that there's a reason-
able explanation as to why an increase in
anti-American sentiment may be justified -
beyond just lack of information. America is a
country of two faces. Domestically, America
is a secular, open and tolerant country, at
least by law. Internationally, it portrays itself
as a power to be feared and, for some people,
loathed. While Pakistanis don't know about
domestic America and its people, it seems
that Americans aren't aware of the face their
country shows to the world.
There's a severe information deficit on both
ends. Through the previous year, I hardly
saw a mention of drone strikes in mainstream

American media. The public seems to be
oblivious to the fact that innocent lives are
lost in drone attacks that the U.S. government
carries out in Pakistan and Yemen. The only
times media mentions the drone strikes are
when a high-profile target is killed. The trag-
edy of innocent lives lost is rarely reported,
and there's very little debate and discussion
on this topic.
. I was appalled by the unprofessionalism in
American news reporting. News feels more
like entertainment.
Anderson Cooper, one of the most promi-
nent anchors on American television, has a
segment on his show AC360 called the 'Rid-
icuList' where, as the name suggests, truly
ridiculous information, such as videos of dogs
singing on YouTube, is shared on prime time
television. The media seems to have forgot-
ten what it once stood for. American media
in the past inspired activism: Students right
here at Michigan and at colleges around the
country, such as University of California,
Berkeley, once protested and organized sit-
ins on their college campuses. They fought
against the Vietnam War and the draft. They
are responsible for bringing an end to injus-
tices committed by the government. Today, in
these very universities, students have forgot-
ten their own history.
When I returned to Pakistan this sum-
mer, newspapers and news channels were
inundated with headlines about drone strikes
and their consequent death counts. In Paki-
stan, drone strikes are seen as inhumane and
immoral. When an area is attacked, houses
are destroyed. When a drone attacks one loca-
tion, people cannot rescue the survivors as
they tremble with pain on the floor because
there's usually another strike in the same
location soon after the initial strike. Such acts
of brutality are what cause people to view the
United States as a monster.
I don't wish to impose my political views on
anyone. I simply recommend that Americans
should demand more information. They should
expect better and more professional journal-
ism. Demand to see the face of America that's
concealed, and be critical of both images.

I recently watched the movie
"Innocence of Muslims", the film
many claim is responsible for inciting
anti-American protests around the
world. This film was shot by a man
named Nakoula Basseley Nakoula,
who turned out to have 17 different
aliases after initial scrutiny. It's by
far the most ridiculous movie I've
seen in my life, and it's depressing
that a filmmaker's hateful agenda
may have cost innocent lives and
ignited turmoil in the Middle East.
The movie depicts a half-witted,
bisexual prophet Mohammed who is
unfaithful, barbaric and lust-driven. I
can understand why Muslims across
the Middle East are outraged at the
movie,butisthistheonlyreasonforall
ofthe hatred? Reporters who talked to
the protesters say that most of them
haven't seen the movie, but have been
told by their preachers that an Israeli-
American movie mocked Mohammed.
It seems as if there are other motives
for the unrest.
The sudden attacks at various U.S.
diplomatic posts, especially the con-
sulate in Libya, came as a surprise
to many. It's clear from reports by
a number of U.S. officials that they
weren't expecting such a violent
outburst in a country they helped
transition into democracy. However,
the mainly Islamist groups that took
down dictators across the Middle
East were never fond of the Unit-
ed States. The attacks and violent
mobs are just another display of this
growing tension.
The fact that these attacks hap-
pened amid an increasingly con-
tested election season means that
America's response to the events is
heavily affected by politics. While

the Republicans took this ill-fated
turn of events as an opening to blunt-
ly criticize President Obama's foreign
policy, the Democrats, including U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
tried to argue that the only reason for
the uprisings was the movie "Inno-
cence of Muslims." All of these par-
tisan attitudes left virtually no room
for an honest evaluation or review of
the events among top U.S. political
candidates and officials.
On the other hand, civil war in
Syria - which until recently was
the center of U.S. attention in Mid-
dle Eastern politics - has been left
aside in light of the new events. I
believe, though, a close inspection
of the dynamics of Syria is key to
exposing the true motives of the
sudden unrest in the Middle East.
Before this summer, the West's
general consensus about Syria was
that the rebels were divided fac-
tions and lacked necessary weap-
onry and military training. But now
they have largely taken over Aleppo,
the country's most populous and
largest city, and are believed to have
a promising shot at taking down
Damascus, the nation's capital.
I spent my summer in Turkey - my
parents live there - and will try to
explain what's going on in the Middle
East, through what I have read in the
Turkish media and my discussions
with people while I was there.
It has come to my attention that
when NATO entered Libya, many
in the West believed that they were
helping Libyans into freedom and
taking risks for the Libyan people.
However, Russia, China and the
Muslim countries regarded this as
a greater plan for the West to exert

power over the Middle East and
control Libya's oil supplies. The
Turks' discussions on U.S. involve-
ment in Egypt started with the
claim that the United States real-
ized Mubarak was out of time and
started to back the protesters in
order to have a say in Egyptian poli-
cies when they come to power.
The typical Middle Easterner
is highly skeptical of U.S. foreign
policy. This might be the result of
years of Western colonization of
the Middle East, as well as many
small occurrences like this incon-
siderate and provocative movie.
This combination could spark years
of suppressed feelings. Arabs have
waited too long to be free; freedom
for them means no oppressors. This
includes Western influence.
The case in Syria is unique. The
consensus in Turkish media is
that Russia sells arms to Bashar
al-Assad, and Turkey and Lebanon
smuggle weaponry into Syria to the
rebels at the request of the United
States. What's more, less than a
month ago, representatives from
the opposition partyin Turkeytried
to get into a Syrian refugee camp in
which Syrian rebels were allegedly
given military training. They were
not let in by the military personnel
who guarded the camp.
My aim was to put all the infor-
mation on the table in an unbiased
way and let you, the reader, do the
deciding. However, I do feel obliged
to condemn the movie that sparked
the protests, and all the protesters
who rallied to take brutal revenge
by attacking innocent people.

'Damages' finale goes back
to roots, finishes strongly

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Senior Arts Editor
When "Damages" began five
years ago, it was a sharp legal
serial wrapped in a pulpy thriller.
With a gripping
season-long
case and non-
linear story- Damages
telling devices,
"Damages" was Series Finale
poised to be a
breakout star. Audience Network
Throw veter-
ans Glenn Close and Ted Dan-
son, plus on-the-rise-star Rose
Byrne and a slew of high-caliber
recurring acts into the mix, and it
w looked like production trio Glenn
and Todd A. Kessler and Daniel
Zelman had an insta-classic on
their hands.
The only other people on this
planet who enjoy a good mind-
fucking more than Patty Hewes
(Close) are the series' writers.
They love to twist a knife into
their viewers' sides, only to
pull it out and reveal it was an
estranged half sister all along.
The show takes every opportu-
nity to rug pull, and the constant
sleight of hand makes it impos-
sible to ever accurately predict
what will happen.
But what made "Damages"
incredible became its fatal flaw.
Its rigid narrative structure -
deeply dependent on flashfor-
wards, flashbacks and dream
sequences - became tedious and
superlative. By its third season,
all the gotcha moments made it
nearly impossible to meet any
new "Damages" revelation with
anything other than ambiva-
lence. And for a serialized thrill-
er that thrives on leaving its fans
in a stupefied state of WTF each
week, that's a serious problem.
FX lost faith, and the show was
4 cancelled until an eleventh-hour
rescue by DirecTV's Audience
Network.
In its fifth and final season,
"Damages" gets back to its roots,

ALBUM REVIEW
G.O.O.D. not good enough
Kanye West __

A closer look at
theFreePussy

salvages label's
mediocre lineup
By EMMA GASE
DailyArts Writer
Like bar mitzvahs and regis-
tering to vote, rappers owning
and operating their own labels is
a time-honored
rite of passage. **
However, (dis-
counting the G.O.O.D.
Jay-Z and P. .I
Diddy's of the usic
world) rarely is Cruel Summer
this a cocktail
that gets mixed G.O.O.D. Music/
correctly. Most Def Jam
of the time, the
only real money-spinners are the
rappers who start the label and
one or two successful proteges,
e.g. Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and
Drake of Young Money, Rick Ross
of Maybach Music, 50 Cent of G
Unit. Which leads us to the for-
mation of rap's latest and great-
est - alabel so good, it could only
be called G.O.O.D.
It all started on the seventh
day, when the rap gods said, "Let
there be a vehicle through which
Kanye West can exhibit his cho-
sen ones to the world, even if
most of them are kind of medio-
cre." And so Cruel Summer was
born.
Technically, CruelSummer is a
collaborative compilation album
by G.O.O.D. Music's slightly
above-average roster. In reality,
this is an impersonal Kanye West
album with acrap ton of features
and a little less haute couture
innovation.
Decreased swagger aside,
everybody wins when an album
begins with R. Kelly singing,
"Deuces minus one, middle fin-
ger to the sky tonight / The whole
world is a couch / Bitch, I'm Rick
James tonight." And in perfect
pitch, no less. It's easy to forget
amongst all the closet adultery
and trial-winning that Kells
has pipes of gold. King of R&B,
indeed. "To the World" isonly
made more immortal by Kanye's
scene-stealing the campaign
rally: "Mitt Romney don't pay
no tax! Mitt Romney don't pay

G.00.D. MUSIC/DEF JAM

"Does this suit make me look phat?"
no tax!" Safe to say Mitt Romney
does not approve this message.
But who cares if it ends up being
the most disgusting moment
of his possible presidency? The
world is a couch, and R. Kelly is
flipping off the world. It must be
Tuesday.
Fortunately, West's sonic
genius makes this album sound
banging on any form of heavily
bass-equipped speakers. Unfor-
tunately, West's luminosity also
casts most of his counterparts
into the shadows. It may not be
surprising, but it is a tad con-
trary to the whole "collaboration"
aspect of the record. At G.O.O.D.
Music, there is an "I" in "Team,"
and it's spelled K-a-n-y-e W-e-s-t.
That's not to say there aren't
some contenders in the G.O.O.D
crew. Pusha T is still the dopest
dope dealer on the lineup (albe-
it the only one, but whatever).
Chief Keef is a Chicago wunder-
kind who provides a welcome
eye-of-the-tiger perspective on
the whole tired Watch the Throne
luxury rap shtick. And Teyana
Taylor sings,-so ... yeah.
West may only rap on eight
of the tracks, but Cruel Summer
has Kanye written all over it -

as it should. It's his label after
all. But you can't help wonder-
ing what would have become of
Cruel Summer if Old Uncle Yeezy
stopped craning over the shoul-
ders of legitimate talents like
Pusha T and Chief Keef. Now, not
to say Kanye's presence is over-
bearing - thereis no question he
is one of the best producers of the
last decade, and that this album
would have been pedestrian at
best without him.
'Ye continues to favor the
underlying operatic choir sam-
ples a la "H.A.M.," and hard,
streamlined variations of "Nig-
gas in Paris." It works, but
it doesn't evoke any sense of
real departure from Watch the
Throne. So Cruel Summer isn't
a masterpiece, which the world
has come to expect from Kanye
West. Talk about some lofty
expectations. Let's cut him a
break now, shall we? Step back:
Is it really realistic to come up
with a masterpiece if Big Sean is
within a forty-mile radius of the
recording booth?
Big Sean aside, there are some
bright moments - nearly one
half of the album is made up of
singles, after all. "I Don't Like"

is flawlessly remixed from the
original by Kanye, and Chief
Keef manages to compress
street-heavy themes into a single
chant turned ultimate war cry:
"That's that shit I don't like." Kid
Cudi shows up on "Creepers"
and does something above aver-
age for the first time since 2009.
"New God Flow" is a meaty, five-
minute leviathan in which every
verse is on point - aside from
the military call-and-response
ending. How come no one vetoed
the "Hey Mickey" ending? And
miraculously, "Clique" isn't even
ruined by Big Sean's unintention-
ally goofy presence.
And so the theory is relegated
to fact: Kanye's collaboration
albums are really just Kanye solo
albums done at sixty-five-perfect
potential. It does take signifi-
cant mental effort to remember
that Cruel Summer is not truly a
Kanye West album, despite the
number of features and Michael
Jackson references. Cruel Sum-
mer kinda proves that G.O.O.D.
Music has some stars in its cache,
but it mostly cements the already
immutable: Kanye West is better
than everyone else. And he knows

Wouters making
up for time lost at
Euro tournament

Midfielder missed
four Michigan
games playing for
Belgian nat'l team
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
As the No. 16 Michigan field
hockey team took on No. 23 Fair-
field on Sunday, a group from
the Michigan men's gymnastics
team, including recent Olympi-
ans Syque Caesar and Sam Miku-
lak, watched from the stands.
At halftime, a number of spec-
tators gathered around the pair
asking for photos. Little did they
know, another athlete who com-
peted on the international stage
this summer was playing right in
front of them.
That was sophomore midfield-
er Axelle Wouters.
Wouters played for the under-
21 Belgian national team at the
Junior European Champion-
ships over the

said. "I was a little tired fromthe
European championship."
Wouters' jetlag has vanished
over the weekend, though, as she
scored all three of her goals on
just three shots - allowing her to
move from last to fourth place on
the team in points for the season.
"She brings a lot savvy and
smart play," Pankratz said. "It
helps the younger kids be in the
right position."
YOUNG GUNS PROVIDING
SPARK: With a combined 19 first-
and second-year players on its
roster, Michigan is searching left
and right for players to fill voids.
Two such players - redshirt
sophomore Leslie Smith and
freshman Aisling Naughton -
have stepped in already.
Smith, through eight games,
has three goals and four assists,
which puts her in second on the
team in points with 10.
Not far behind with seven
points is Naughton, who added
her third goal of the season on
Sunday.

By halftime on Saturday
against Massachusetts, about
half of the Michigan football stu-
dent section'had already cleared
out of the Big House. Withthe
Wolverines up 42-13, the game
was under control, and the crowd
got bored.
It appeared that the fans were
already looking ahead to this
week, with a primetime matchup
at Notre Dame looming.
"It's exciting," said redshirt
junior left tackle Taylor Lewan.
"Michigan's big three rivalries -

Receiving corps proves deeper than anticipated

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
In passing for 294 yards against
Massachusetts on Saturday, senior
quarterback Denard Robinson did
more than just produce in terms of
sheer volume.
He also spread the ball around
as well as he has at any point in his
career, with nine different play-
ers catching passes throughout
the game. It matched the highest
total of different receivers that
Robinson has hit in a single game
since he began playinginoffensive
coordinator Al Borges' hybrid pro
style system last season.
Part of that progress can be
explained by Michigan's oppo-
nent - the Minutemen don't have
the strongest of defenses, allowing
the Wolverines to use more receiv-
ers than perhaps they would have
against a more formidable oppo-
nent.
But after three games, it nev-
ertheless seems that Michigan
might have more options in the
passing game than it thought it did
going into the season.
"You know, the one thing(from)
last week is I think (wide receiver
is) probably one of the better posi-
tions on our team from a depth
standpoint," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke on Monday.
Wide receiver was a position
of some concern after Junior

Junior wide receiver Devin Gardner, a converted quarterback, is Michigan's No.1 receiver through three weeks.

know that we can do it, we need to
keep doing it, even when we play
against the Notre Dames and all of
the other big teams."
Just what is the problem for
Michigan's big uglies? Technique
- which is often the first word
out of Hoke's mouth, when talking
about all of the team's positions -
is part of it.
But offensive line is also the
most physical position in a very
physical sport. That's what Lewan
is looking at.
"Technique will get you to the
spot you need to go to, and then
you have to be aggressive," Lewan
said. "You have to be physical. You
got to play angry, a little nasty. I
think our offensive line needs to
do that a little more."
BLOCKING IT OUT: The transi-
tion to wide receiver has been a
relatively easy one for Gardner.
There are still some areas the
junior is working on, though,
especially blocking. Hoke lauded
Gardner's efforts as he tries to
improve that aspect of his game,
but also noted that it's something
he never had to do before.
And if Gardner has his way, it's
something he won't have to do in
the future if he eventually returns
to quarterback, as he says he
wants to do.
"I don't feel like I'm ever going
to be a person that loves to block,"
Gardner said with a laugh. "That
comes with the position. I don't
think I'll ever love that."

num was dismissed from the team
after repeated legal offenses.
But junior Devin Gardner's
move from quarterback to wideout
has helped ease those concerns.
The Detroit native is the team's
leading receiver, with 155 yards,
and three of his eight catches have
been for touchdowns - his height
and athleticism have made him a
welcome target for Robinson.
Meanwhile, redshirt junior Jer-
emy Gallon has continued to be a
solid option despite his diminutive
frame. And freshman tight end
Devin Funchess is emerging as
one of the more dynamic threats
that Michigan has had at the posi-
tion in years, averaging just over

23 yards per catch in his first two
career games.
And Robinson has shown an
improved ability to find all those
targets. He seems to be making
better reads, and he's also throw-
ing with greater accuracy.
"I think this summer, the things
he did made a huge difference,"
said redshirt junior offensive
tackle Taylor Lewan. "The way he
was playing and just being more
into his craft, and making better
decisions and working on timing
with the receivers every Saturday.
Every chance he got, he called the
receivers up to do that."
Take Robinson's improvements
and add in the emergence of sev-

eral new threats, as well as the
steady play of some veterans, and
it amounts to a pleasant surprise
for the Wolverines when it comes
to their passing game.
ANGER MANAGEMENT: The
dissatisfaction with Michigan's
offensive line through the first
three games has been made very
clear, both by Hoke and the line-
men themselves.
For his part, Lewan said Mon-
day that he saw some improve-
ment against Massachusetts, but
repeated the familiar mantra
about needing to improve.
"I think as an offensive line,
we needed to see that we could do
it," Lewan said. "And now that we

The estimated cost for the
replacement is $1.2 million, which
includes the addition of a new
"penthouse mechanical room" to
the roof to control the elevators.
Slottow estimated the work would
be completed by spring 2014, if
approved.
In another communication,
Slottow wrote that the Willard
H. Dow Laboratory is in need of
two replacement chiller units.
The new units, which command
a price of $7 million, will lead to
$600,000 annual savings for the
University, he wrote.
The two current steam absorp-
tion chillers, installed in 1988, are
slated to be replaced by electric
chillers. According to the com-
munication, a third steam absorp-
tion chiller failed in 2010 and has
already been replaced by an elec-
tric chiller.
The $7 million estimate
includes new piping, control
valves and an electrical substation
to provide adequate power to the
new units. If approved, the project
would be completedhley fall 2013.

Marshall said the program
has been popular since its imple-
mentation, noting that the 15
rental bicycles available for the
semester were rented in the first
week they were available, and a
waitlist has already opened for
next semester. He added that
the group already has plans to
expand next fall.
The organizers of the program
and members of the campus
community have also expressed
interest in expanding the initia-
tive to a bike-sharing program,
which would allow Ann Arbor
residents and students to use
bikes for short distance trips.
LSA senior Joseph Elliot, the
founder and executive director

of TruMich, a student advocacy
group dedicated to sustainable
transit, said a bike-share pro-
gram would be better than the
existing bike rental program
because it would allow students
easier accessibility.
"Bike rental is a long term
usage, whereas bike sharing is
from station to station," Elliot
said. "It's for getting in between
classes, or between North Cam-
pus and Main Street."
Last year, TruMich start-
ed a petition and held forums
designed to garner support for
a bike-share program on cam-
pus. The proposed system would
involve implementation of kiosks
around campus that would grant
short-term bike rental with use
of a valid MCard.
Elliot told the Daily last Feb-
ruary that a bike-share pro-
gram is critical to aiding student
transportation, and had been

"We will still bring that stu-

they can do to make this situa-
tion right and repair the harm,"
Mowers said.
Despite insistence that edu-
cation on the law was built into
University Housing program
training, there remains a dis-
crepancy between residents that
claim the law was clearly men-
tioned during their annual hall
meeting, and others that said it
wasn't discussed.
LSA junior Scott Dorsett, an
off-campus resident who didn't
know about the new policy, said
students have a personal respon-
sibility to learn the laws for
themselves. However, he added
that he thinks the University
could easily alleviate confusion
by better informingstudents.
"It wouldn't be too much trou-
ble for them to send out an e-mail
to everyone on campus," said
Dorsett. "They are not obligated
to do more, but, since it's so easy,
maybe they should."
AccordingtoMaryJoDesprez,
administrator of the University's

Alcohol and Other Drug Policy
and Prevention program, the
AODPP is incorporating the
new law into its educational
materials, and is also creating a
frequently asked questions page
about the law on its website.
The program also informed
fraternity and sorority presi-
dents about the law during a
presentation prior to Welcome
Week.
Additionally, the law was
included in the off-campus liv-
ing guide, which was distribut-
ed by Beyond the Diag, a student
organization dedicated to unit-
ing neighborhoods on campus.
Desprez said the revised
2012 Alcohol and Other Drug
Policy handbook has informa-
tion about the new law and will
be sent out to all students in the
next four weeks.
"There is not going to be one
right medium," Desprez said.
"There's a lot of energy around
all the different kinds of ways
we can use this information."
Ann Hower, the director
of the Office of New Student
Programs, which coordinates
freshmen orientation, said
freshmen were informed about
the law multiple times during
orientation.

endorsed by the Central Student
Government and LSA Student
Government's Taking Responsi-
bility for the Earth and Environ-
ment subcommittee last winter
semester.
"Bike-sharing could be the
most accessible form of transit
here," Elliott told the Daily in
February. "Even though Main
Street is not that far away, it is
still a hassle. The sharingsystem
will enable students to explore
the city and campus more."
Bob Grese, a professor in the
School of Natural Resources and
the Environment, agreed that
expansion of the Blue Bikes pro-
gram is necessary.
"I'm not sure it will reach
its full potential unless it can
expand a bit," Grese said. "A
bike-share program has more
potential in the long run. Maybe
a bike rental program is the first
start."
Specifically, students were
told about the law during a lec-
ture by Department of Public
Safety officers and at an infor-
mational skit performed by the
University's Education Theater
Company. Though the law went
into effect only two days before
orientation started, Hower said
she felt the orientation program
successfully informed freshmen
about its implications.
"It's new for everybody, not
just new students, but we want-
ed to make sure the newstudents
knew about this," Hower said.
Information about the law
was also included in the online
Community Matters course on
alcohol and sexual assault edu-
cationthat freshmen and under-
graduate transfer students are
required to take.
Central Student Govern-
ment President Manish Parikh,
a Business senior, said he has
been in touch with many cam-
pus leaders about promoting
the law through larger campus
venues.
"At CSG, we remain commit-
ted to promoting the law, and as
always we remain committed to
promoting a safe environment
for all Wolverines on campus,"
Parikh said.
LRC instructor Johnathon
Beals, the game's project manag-
er said its purpose is to increase
student participation in the
theme ina creative way.
"The goal was to show how
something can be fun and to pro-
vide a novel way to get people to
think about translation and inter-
act with it instead of just writing
down a text," Beals said.
PranaySethi, aSchool of Infor-
mation graduate student and
another developer of the appli-
cation, said the game adds depth
and complexity to students'
understanding of translation.
"Translation for everybody
can be subjective," Sethi said.
"This idea tries to convey the
idea that everybody's translation
can be different, you just need to
justify your translation."
In addition to the app, the
theme semester has a website
that promotes upcoming events
and allows students to blog,

interact and get involved.
LSA sophomore Theo Munch 4
said the theme is relevant to
University students.
"We have a very diverse stu-
dent population, so I think it's
important to have a good trans-
lation of everyone's different
ideas," Munch said.
LSA junior Julia Hickey is on
the student advisory board for
the theme semester and is head
of the translation forum within
the Residential College. She said
she is enthusiastic about having
additional resources and oppor-
tunities to learn about transla-
tion.
"Translation is a way of con-
necting with people from dif-
ferent cultures and getting a
better understanding of differ-
ent experiences of the world,"
Hickey said. "I'm personally
really excited about it because
it means a lot of events that my
club gets to go to and a lot of
exciting opportunities for us."
