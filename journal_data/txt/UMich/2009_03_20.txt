DANCIN'AND ADVANGIN'

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -
The blue NCAA insignias
were sewn on the left
shoulder of the Michigan
men's basket-
ball team's jer-
seys.

the game.
At -Wednes-
day's team dinner, Michigan men's
basketball coach John Beilein
allowed the Wolverines to eat at
The Cheesecake Factory instead of
at their team hotel. He figured they
deserved it. Desserts aren't nor-
mally served. during team meals,
but sophomore forward Manny
Harris ordered both ice cream and
brownies.
No matter how many elements
you added, it still seemed surreal.
This is the NCAA Tournament.
And Michigan is there.
After an 11-year absence from
the Big Dance, just getting a bid
would have been enough for some.
But from the tipoff of Michigan's
62-59 win over Clemson last night,
the desire for more was obvious.
The Wolverines were playing in
the Tournament and actually
dominating.

Sophomore forward Manny Har-
ris connected on three 3-pointers
in the first half. Freshman guard
Stu Douglass stole the ball at half
court and finished with a dunk to
force a Clemson timeout. His team-
mates erupted from the bench and
rushed towards him like it was the
national championship game.
Maize-clad fans chanted "The
Victors" during a timeout, com-
pletely unprovoked.
Michigan held a 16-point lead
early in the second half.
But this team believed all of it
was real all along.
Junior forward Deshawn Sims
admitted he had some pregame
anxieties, and a couple early air-
balls proved it.
And when Clemson came within
one point, with less than a minute
to play, redlity finally hit for every-
one else.
What were the Wolverines really
doing here?
"To a lot of people, it probably
felt like that but ... to ourself, we
expected to win," Harris said. "We .
wanted to win and that was the
main thing."
Harris, the player pegged to turn
Michigan's program around, came
back with yet another unstop-
pable play -- maybe the biggest of
his young career. And you better
believe it looked good on national
television.

Regents also discuss

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
Students from across campus
filled the Regents' Room in the
Fleming Administration Building

yesterday to urge the University
Board of Regents at its monthly
meeting to freeze tuition next
year.
Members of the campus group
Stop the Hike
calledonregents NOTEBOOK
and University
administrators to maintain cur-
rent tuition rates for the next
academic year as long. as state
appropriations remain the same.
Speaking before the regents,
Engineeringsenior AshwinLalen-

dran said Stop the Hike hopes to
keep the University accessible to
all students by temporarily halting
the recent up-ticks in tuition.
Lalendran noted that the
Michigan Student Assembly, the
LSA Student Government, the

Government, the Residence Hall
Association and the Interfrater-
nity Council, among others, have
all passed resolutions supporting

spend the rest of the night relaxing
with his fellow party members. But
in the morning, Mahanti said he
knows there is work to be done.
He said he plans to speak with
current MSA President Sabrina
Shingwani and the rest of the exec-
utive board to talk about how to
move the assembly forward.
This year's election saw a signifi-
cant jump in voter turnout, some-
thing the MSA Election Board was
actively working to improve. Last
winter, 2,246 votes were cast in
the election - about 6.4 percent of
the student body. This year's elec-
tion had more than twice that, with
4,497 students casting votes for the
executive slate.
Election Director Emily Winter
said the more than 100-percent
increase in voter turnout was large-
ly due to the fact that this year's
election did not feature a single,
dominating party.

"Obviously in this election there
are two parties who both had great
visions for the organization and
for the school, and great teams of
people in their campaigns," Win-
ter said. "I think people responded
to that."
For the past five semesters lead-
ing up to this year's election, MSA
was run primarily by the Michigan
Action Party - a party that dis-
solved six weeks ago after Baydoun
and Mahanti, who were supposed
to be the party's presidential and
vice presidential candidates, cre-
ated their own groups.
Hours after hearing the results,
Mahanti said he still couldn't
believe what had happened.
"I guess we had fought so hard
for a campaign that was very prag-
matic and personality based that
I didn't know that people could
mobilize," he said. "I wasn't sure
that this experiment would work."

DANCE MARATHON
A look behind the impact of UMDM

For many families,
Dance Marathon is a
life-changing event
By VERONICA MENALDI
.Daily Staff Reporter
Almost 12 years ago, twins
Miles and Evan Peguese were
born three months early, weighing
only 1 lb12 oz and 1 lb 9 oz, respec-

tively. Their mother, Andrea Peg-
uese, was told that if her children
were to survive they would face a
pretty difficult life ahead.
Andrea said she "never lost
faith and just knew that they were
going to make it." And that is what
they did: her "miracle babies" sur-
vived. In the summer of 2003, her
five-year-old twins were selected
as Michigan ambassadors to rep-
resent the state for the Children's
Miracle Network, an organization

that raises money for children's
hospitals.
But Peguese said that her kids,
who were diagnosed with cere-
bral palsy, would have never got-
ten this opportunity without the.
help of the University of Michigan
Dance Marathon organization.
"It's really because of the Dance
Marathon that we really got intro-

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
13 companies getting
bailout money owe
back taxes
At least 13 companies receiving
billions of dollars in bailout money
owe a total of more than $220 mil-
lion in unpaid federal taxes, a key
lawmaker said yesterday.
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., chair-
man of a House subcommittee
overseeing the federal bailout, said
two companies owe more than $100
million apiece.
"This is shameful. It is a dis-
grace," said Lewis. "We are going
to get to the bottom of what is going
on here."
The House Ways and Means sub-
committee on oversight discovered
the unpaid taxes in a review of tax
records from 23 companies receiv-
ing the most money, Lewis said as
he opened a hearing on the issue.
The committee said it could not
legally release the names. of the
companies owing taxes. It said
one recipient of bailout money had
almost $113 million in unpaid fed-
eral income taxes from 2005 and
2006. A second recipient owed
almost $102 million dating to
before 2004. Another was behind
$1.1 million in federal income taxes
and $223,000 in federal employ-
ment taxes.
CAMP BUCCA, lraq
Many Iraqis held
by U.S. to go free
Thousands of Iraqis held with-
out charge by the United States on
suspicion of links to insurgents or
militants are being freed by this
summer because there is little or no
evidence against them.
Their release comes as the U.S.
prepares to turn over its deten-
tion system to the fledgling Iraqi
government by early 2010. In the
six years since the war began, the
military ultimately detained some
100,000 suspects, many of whom
were picked up in U.S.-led raids
during a raging, bloody insurgency
that has since died down.
The effort to do justice for those
wrongly held to begin with, some
for years, also runs the risk of
releasing extremists who could be a
threat to fragile Iraqi security.
As part of an agreement between
the two countries that took effect
Jan. 1, Iraqi authorities have begun
reviewingthecases ofthe detainees
to decide whether to free them or
press charges. About 13,300 remain
behind barbed wire in U.S. custody
in Iraq.
DALLAS
Dallas school accused
of staging fights
The Dallas school system was
rocked by allegations yesterday
that staff members at an inner-city
high school made students settle
their differences by fighting bare-
knuckle brawls inside a steel cage.
The principal and other employ-
ees at South Oak Cliff High knew
about the cage fights and allowed
the practice to continue, according

to a 2008 report by school system
investigators.
"More than anything, I'm in
shock and disbelief - shocked that
this could ever occur and shocked
that it would be condoned by a
professional administrator," said
Jerome Garza, a member of the
Dallas school board.
The report, first obtained by The
Dallas Morning News, describes
two instances of fighting in an
equipment cage in a boys' locker
room between 2003 and 2005.
It was not clear from the report
whether there were other fights.
WASHINGTON
Rethinking the
math around buying
a used vehicle
For cash-strapped consum-
ers shopping for a car, used would
seem like the place to start. Not
necessarily. A new one might actu-
ally be cheaper.
Consider this: The average cost
of a used 2008 Honda Accord EX
sedan, certified by the dealership,
was $21,544 earlier this month,
according to Edmunds.com, a car-
buying Web site. A new 2009 model
cost $80 less.
It's simple supply and demand.
With new car sales at a 27-year
low and desperate dealers piling
on rebates and incentives, prices
are plummeting. At the same time,
demand is up for used cars and
their values are rising.

passes bill1 taxing AIG

Bill imposes 90
percent tax on
employee bonuses
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Denouncing a "squandering of the
people's money," lawmakers voted
decisively yesterday to impose a
90 percent tax on millions of dol-
lars in employee bonuses paid by
troubled insurance giant AIG and
other bailed-out companies.
The House vote was 328-93.
Similar legislation has been intro-
duced in the Senate and President
Barack Obama quickly signaled
general support for the concept.
"I look forward to receiving a
final product that will serve as a
strongsignalto the executives who
run these firms that such compen-
sation will not be tolerated," the
president said in a statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif, told colleagues, "We want
our money back now for the tax-
payers. It isn't that complicated."
The outcome may not have been
complicated. But the lopsided vote
failed -to reflect the contentious
political battle that preceded it.
Republicans took Democrats to
task for rushing to tax AIG bonus-
es worth an estimated $165 million
after the majority party stripped
from last month's economic stimu-
lus bill a provision that could have
banned such payouts.
"This political circus that's
going on here today with this bill
is not getting to the bottom of
the questions of who knew what
and when did they know it," said

House Republican Leader John
Boehner of Ohio.
He voted "no," but 85 fellow
Republicans joined 243 Democrats
in voting "yes." It was opposed by
six Democrats and 87 Republi-
cans.
The bill would impose a 90
percent tax on bonuses given to
employees with family incomes
above $250,000 at American Inter-
national Group and other com-
panies that have received at least
$5 billion in government bailout
money. It would apply to any such
bonuses issued since Dec. 31.
The House vote, after just 40
minutes of debate, showed how
quickly Congress can act when the
political will is there.
It was only this past weekend
that the bailed-out insurance giant
paid bonuses totaling $165 million
to employees, including traders in
the Financial Products unit that
nearly brought about AIG's col-
lapse.
AIG has received $182.5 billion
in federal bailoutmoney and is now
80 percent government-owned.
Disclosure of the bonuses
touched off a national firestorm
that both the Obama administra-
tion and Congress have scurried to
contain.
In a statement issued by the
White House late Thursday,
Obama said the House vote "right-
ly reflects the outrage that so many
feel over the lavish bonuses that
AIG provided its employees at the
expense of the taxpayers who have
kept this failed company afloat."
"In the end, this is a symptom of
a larger problem - a bubble-and-

bust economy that valued reckless
speculation over responsibility and
hard work," he said. "That is what
we must ultimately repair to build
a lasting and widespread prosper-
ity."
In his statement, Obama did
not explicitly endorse the House
bill. Instead, he was careful to
take a wait-and-see attitude on the
details of the final legislation while
making clear that he supports the
effort to get the bonus money back
for taxpayers.
Topic No. 1 raised by Repub-
licans during the House debate
was the last-minute altering of a
provision in Obama's $787 billion
stimulus law to cap executive com-
pensation for firms receiving gov-
ernment bailouts.
The measure might have
forestalled payment of the AIG
bonuses.
But Senate Banking Commit-
tee Chairman Chris Dodd, a Con-
necticut Democrat and the author
of the provision, says the admin-
istration insisted that he modify
his proposal so that it would only
apply to payments agreed to in the
future.
That, critics claim, cleared the
way for the AIG payouts.
"The idea came from the admin-
istration," Dodd said Thursday
Dodd said he was not aware of
any AIG bonuses at the time the
change was made.
Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner confirmed such conver-
sations with Dodd. He said the
administration was worried about
possible legal challenges to the pro-
vision.

Student veterans
say colleges play
central role in return
to civilian life
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
The transition from high school
senior to college freshman can
be pretty tough - harder classes,
moving into the dorms and sepa-
ration from parents and family.
But for US veterans, who are more
used to the rigors of the battlefield
than the classroom, the jump is
exponentially different.
Two student veterans spoke
yesterday about the ways in which
universities can help those who
have served in combat and now
must make the quick change to life
as college students. The speech
was part of the seventh annual
Depression on College Campuses
Conference, hosted by the Univer-
sity's Depression Center.
The talk focused on the need for
campus organizations to provide
student veterans with the emo-
tional support and connections to
other veterans who have been in
and are facingsimilar situations.
Bryan Adams, who served as
an army sniper in Iraq from 2004-
2005 and is now a junior at Rutgers
University, spoke about the dif-
ficulty of the transition between
military life and college life, which
can easily lead to depression.
"I would go out and try to have
a good time, and one negative
thought would pop into my brain,"
he said. "My whole attitude would
change."
Adams, who is president of Rut-
gers Veterans for Education, added
that many student veterans have
similar feelings when they transi-
tion back to civilian life.
"It's a natural reaction to an
abnormal circumstance."
Adams emphasized the need

for cooperation between veterans
entering universities and the com-
munity as a whole to aid student
veterans' success.
"There needs to be an under-
standing of the nature of the con-
flict and the nature of the problem
that student veterans are facing,"
he said.
Adams pointed out that many
universities lack comprehensive
programs that offer guidance for
veterans in their shift to college
life.
Derek Blumke, who served in
Iraq as an aircraft electrician
and maintenance supervisor in
the Air Force and is now an LSA
junior, also discussed the diffi-
cult switch between active duty
and student life and the need for
campus-wide understanding of
the difference between the mili-
tary and college.
Citinginsensitive questions from
fellow students and professors as a
source of difficulty adjusting well
to college life, Blumke, co-founder
and president of Student Veterans
of America, stated that there needs
to be a level of sensitivity toward
topics concerning military life.
"We're not faulting people for
being curious, just be aware of the
situation," he said.
Both Adams and Blumke work
in their respective universities as
well as on a national level to advo-
cate for student veteran groups
on college campuses. Their work
focuses on bringing student vet-
erans together to ensure they do
not feel alone in their experiences,
something both say they have felt
personally in the past.
"I need to take my experience
and transfer it into a positive thing
for myself and my fellow veterans,"
Adams said.
Blumke and Adams added that
they hope their experiences in the
military will help them to make a
difference.
"We want to make changes, not
just for ourselves, but for society as

Wilkerson says some
Gitmo detainees
have been there six
or seven years
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)
- Many detainees locked up at
Guantanamo were innocent men
swept up by U.S. forces unable to
distinguish enemies from noncom-
batants, a former Bush administra-
tion official said yesterday.
"There are still innocent people
there," Lawrence B. Wilkerson, a
Republican who was chief of staff
to then-Secretary of State Colin
Powell, told The Associated Press.
"Some have been there six or seven
years."
Wilkerson, who first made the
assertions in an Internet posting
on Tuesday, told the AP he learned
from briefings and by communi-
cating with military commanders

that the U.S. soon realized many
Guantanamo detainees were inno-
cent but nevertheless held them in
hopes they could provide informa-
tion for a "mosaic" of intelligence.
"It did not matter if a detainee
were innocent. Indeed, because he
lived in Afghanistan and was cap-
tured on or near the battle area, he
must know something of impor-
tance," Wilkerson wrote in the
blog. He said intelligence analysts
hoped to gather "sufficient infor-
mation about a village, a region,
or a group of individuals, that dots
could be connected and terrorists
or their plots could be identified."
Wilkerson, a retired Army colo-
nel, said vetting on the battlefield
during the early stages of U.S.
military operations in Afghanistan
was incompetent with no mean-
ingful attempt to determine "who
we were transporting to Cuba for
detention and interrogation."
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon,
a Pentagon spokesman, declined

to comment on Wilkerson's spe-
cific allegations but noted that
the military has consistently said
that dealing with foreign fighters
from a wide variety of countries in
a wartime setting was a complex
process. The military has insisted
that those held at Guantanamo
were enemy combatants and posed
a threat to the United States.
In his posting for The Washing-
ton Note blog, Wilkerson wrote
that "U.S. leadership became
aware of this lack of proper vet-
ting very early on and, thus, of the
reality that many of the detainees
were innocent of any substantial
wrongdoing, had little intelligence
value, and should be immediately
released."
Former Defense Secretary Don-
ald Rumsfeld and Vice President
Dick Cheney fought efforts to
address the situation, Wilkerson
said, because "to have admitted
this reality would have been a
black mark on their leadership."

Joint innovation
Businesses and students can work together for social benefit
W ith budgets that sometimes barely cover paper
flyers, student groups inevitably face a struggle
to find funding. It's unfortunate that this is the
case since cash is often the only stumbling block between
student groups' ideas and reality. But when graduate stu-
dents from the University's College of Engineering gained
sponsorship from Google, they found a way to beat these
money troubles. The result was a product with benefits
for the Kenyan people the students were helping and for
Google. In a world that begs for new ways of thinking, com-
panies should take the initiative to invest in student proj-
ects, because the results are good for everyone.

The need for non-profits

What began as a class project for 25 Engi-
neering graduate students ended in the
implementation of a system that brought
Internet access to a rural community in
Kenya. The students developed an inex-
pensive and easy-to-use ground system
that connects computers to the Internet
via satellite. The Internet system works in
locations without widespread electricity
by using solar energy and battery power to.
run the system. But without the financial
aid of Google - which opened an office in
Ann Arbor in 2006 and has a partnership
with the University to digitalize its libraries
- the system would have never been more
than a prototype.
This project is just one example of the
kind of innovation that students are capable
of. There is no place more conducive to stu-
dent creativity than communities like the
University. The academic environment the
University provides encourages students to
question the institutions failing in today's
economic and political conditions. As a
result, students gain a fresh commitment to
make a difference, at home and abroad.
But students have more than enthusiasm
- they have the knowledge to make their
ideas reality. When students' activism com-
bines with their gift for innovation, the ben-
efits can be far-reaching and invaluable. In
the case of the graduate engineers, people
in an underprivileged region of a nation
much less wealthy than the United States
now have access to knowledge they other-

wise never would have.
If the most recent presidential election
demonstrated anything, it was that stu-
dents are fired up to change the world. The
only thing stopping them is money - and
that's where business comes in. In the cur-
rent economic climate, many wealthy com-
panies and CEOs are increasingly viewed
as the bad guys. By funding student activ-
ism to make a difference, companies can
improve their image while enhancing inno-
vation. It's a situation from which everyone
can benefit.
And students are aware of the potential
for corporate cooperation. One example is
the MPowered Entrepreneurship program,
which was created in 2007 by two Univer-
sity students. MPowered seeks to connect
students with companies to back projects.
As long as companies are willing, there is
no shortage of student groups looking for
financial backing. Businesses and students
should utilize resources like MPowered to
connect to each other for the end-goal of
financing innovation.
There are plenty of students with good
ideas for improving the world around them.
There are dozens of companies that could
stand to gain from assisting student innova-
tion and activism. And there are millions of
needy people in the world just waiting for
partnerships like this to take off. If other
companies follow Google's lead and finance
similar ventures, student passion can trans-
late into action.

Jn the summer of 2001, my cousin
Nakul was bitten by a mosquito.
Because of that mosquito bite, he
contracted Dengue
fever, a disease that
causes fever, severe
headaches, muscle
and joint pain. He
died within days
after suffering tre-
mendously. In the
end, his body crack-
led like fire. I've
been told by rela- NEIL
tives who were at TAMBE
the hospital in India
during his passing
that while he was
suffering in a state of delirium, all he
could muster up the energy to do was
whimper for an apple. I think about
him almost daily, for many reasons.
I don't bring up the circumstances
surrounding his death as a sob story
meant to inspire some group of people
to rally behind a campaign to prevent
vector-borne diseases. I don't mention
it as a way to honor him - Nakul con-
tracted the first case of Dengue fever
in his area of India, which allowed
medical professionals to act quickly in
subsequent cases and save many lives
-or as a way for me to come to terms
with his death. I bring him up as one
vivid, narrow example of the utterly
terrible things that can happen to a
person. I bring him up to argue one
point: don't stop donating.
Non-profit organizations make a
world of difference in solving social
problems. We need non-profit organi-
zations to serve community needs that
businesses and government cannot (or
will not) address. If there had been bet-

ter medical facilities or public health
initiatives in India, for example, Nakul
might be alive today. There are many
examples of non-profits making a dif-
ference in the communities they serve,
whether it's the work of organizations
that provide after-school programs for
high school students or humanitarian
aid to countries ravaged by war.
If we are at all capable of finan-
cially supporting non-profits, we have
a social responsibility to do so even
during times of economic downturn
because of the impact they have on the
individual communities they serve
and on society as a whole. Most of us
here .are probably financially stable
enough to support non-profits, even if
we have immediate family members
who are unemployed or are burdened
with student loans.
If you have enough money to go out
on a Friday night, order one less beer
and give the money you saved to your
favorite charity via an online donation
or to the kid bucketing outside at 2
a.m. A college student who owns a cell
phone, iPod or working television has
more wealth than much of the world's
population. There are people in the
world who need the $10 bill in our
pockets more than we do. For most,
choosing not to donate money to non-
profit organizations is more often due
to an absence of commitment than an
absence of cash.
If you can make a donation to a
non-profit organization - even a
small one - the organization will
appreciate it. Tough economic times
are when non-profits need the most
support. But if you can't make a sub-
stantial donation, there are many
other ways to support the missions of

non-profits. Consider volunteering on
a committee or board of a non-profit
organization that inspires you.
Students should
give back, even
in hard times.
On, campus, it's even easier to vol-
unteer time and energy. You could
volunteer to be a moraler dancers at
the University of Michigan Dance
Marathon this weekend or attend the
Luminaria ceremony at Relay for Life
in two weeks. If community service is
your thing, participate in the Detroit
Partnership's service day or one of
their many weekly opportunities. Will
Work for Food, a non-profit organiza-
tion started by students at the Univer-
sity that provides an innovative model
for raising funds and serving one's
own community simultaneously, is
another worthy charity.
I'll never know if Nakul's life would
have been saved if there had been
stronger public health non-profits in
India. But it's not about me; there are
better reasons to have a stake in the
success of non-profit organizations.
Non-profits make crucial contribu-
tions to our locale, nation and world.
But they'll never get the chance to
make a difference if we walk away
from funding them.

Io 'THE DAILY:
This past Thursday, Grand Valley State Uni-
versity student Derek Copp was shot in the
upper right chest as police were attempting to
carry out a search warrant for his apartment.
Students around the nation demand to know
why officers decided it was necessary to use
such extreme force with Copp.
Although the police have been limiting their
statements to journalists, it has come to light
that illicit drugs were the target of the raid. I
understand that in rare situations where an
officer or civilian is in immediate danger, the
use of firearms may be necessary. But what
prompted the officer to fire upon a well-liked
film student?
I have a guess.
When serving the warrant, the team of offi-
cers decided that it was necessary to enter the
residence by surprise - through the rear slid-
ing door of Copp's apartment. I can imagine the
surprise and terror that Copp must have felt as
officers burst in with their guns drawn, order-
ing him to the floor. I would not be surprised if
it came to light that Copp tried to run from the
armed men who had burst unannounced into
his home. Fearing that he may be reaching for a
weapon, the officer in question may have fired.
Whatever reason the officer had for firing,
I would like to know why they decided upon a
rear entry to begin with. Why burst in through
the back of someone's residence when the front
door works just fine?
This situation could have been avoided if
the police would have used proper judgment
regarding the gravity of the offense (possible
possession and distribution of illicit substances)
and the suspect himself (a guitar-playing film
student). Knocking on the front door, present-
ing the warrant and then entering to carry out
the search seems like a more appropriate course
of action.

TO THE DAILY:
Every year, more than 250 species of birds,
including warblers, thrushes, and tanagers, fly
through Michigan during their spring and fall
migrations. These birds rely most heavily on the
stars and moon as a guide in the night. As birds
fly over our well-lit urban areas, the lights -
especially those from buildings over four stories
tall - can disorient them. The birds will circle
the bright buildings until they die from exhaus-
tion or collide with the structure.
Many communities are helping prevent the
frequent deaths of night-migrating birds. By
turning off lights on the fifth floor and above
in urban buildings between the hours of 11 p.m.
and 6 a.m. during peak migration seasons, many
birds can be saved. Some cities, such as Chicago,
New York, Minneapolis and Toronto, already
have these programs in place.
The Michigan Audubon Society is working
with Detroit Audubon Society and other local
Audubon groups to make bird death prevention a
statewide effort. As a part of this effort, the State
of Michigan has proclaimed the periods of Mar.
15 to May 31 and Aug.15 to Oct.31as Safe Passage
Great Lakes Days.
Individuals who live or work at night in
buildings with five or more floors (including
University buildings, such as residence halls)
can help to minimize fatal light problems. Indi-
viduals can help by using blinds and curtains to
conceal lighted areas if working after 11 p.m.,
using desk lamps and task lighting to minimize
perimeter lighting or using interior working
areas for night activities.
Turning lights off from the fifth floor and up
will not only protect the lives of many birds that
fly over our city at night, but will save money,
conserve energy and reduce pollution as well.

bon's Safe Passage Program at http://www.

My parents were and still are the
most important people in my world.
But they did leave my brother and me
alone at home, without a nanny or a
babysitter, while they went dancing
at clubs ten years ago. If something
like that were to happen today, my
parents might be reported to Child
Protective Services and convicted of
negligence. Today, children are con-
sidered fragile, weak things that par-
ents should coddle and smother with
too much attention. Children are not
only spoiled but also suffocated.
In his book, "Paranoid Parenting,"
sociologist Frank Furedi noted that
in 1971, about eight in ten children
were allowed to walk to school alone.
When his book was published in 2002,
the number had dropped to less than
one in ten children. That's probably
due to recent changing in parenting
habits. In recent years, there has been
an upward spike in the cult of para-
noid parenting. Parents are undoubt-
edly feeling the heat - none of them
want to seem incompetent. They
don't want to be at fault if their child
contracts skin cancer from frolicking
in the sun for 20 minutes or falls from
the balcony of another child's house
while at a play date.
Besides the negative effect this
phase has on children, it is taxing

parents financially. Entrepreneurs
have long understood and taken
advantage of parents' trend of fear
and they're bringing in big bucks as a
result. A visit to a bookstore or some
surfing on the Internet provides the
evidence. There are a myriad of par-
enting guidebooks, manuals, kits
and, to my utmost horror, a website
that sells products like child locators,
detoxification products and scout
survival kits. The online store is aptly
called the Paranoid Parent Stop Wor-
rying Shop. And while parents' inten-
tions are good at heart, this kind of
overprotective, overbearing fussing
actually has a negative impact.
All the mollycoddling leads to an
excessively dependent child. Parents
are robbing children out of a crucial
learning period in their lives with
stringent rules, excessive attention
and a rigid lifestyle. These are the kind
of children who spend their lives being
told what to wear, how much sugar to
put in coffee (if they're allowed caf-
feine, that is) and when to study.
When children aren't expected to
learn things for themselves, they lose
valuable skills they will need to sur-
vive once they're on their own. Once
children are away from their parents
- like at college, for example - they
won't have someone sitting with

them while they study or bringing
them cookies and milk as they burn
the midnight oil. If children need to
fail to learn, they should be allowed
to fail.
Admittedly, as a 20 year-old, I am
no expert on how to raise a child. But
I have confidence in the way my par-
ents did it. It did not include guide-
books of any sort. When considering
my upbringing, one word comes to
mind: values. I'm talking about values
like respect, kindness and bravery.
These are, by far, the most valuable
' things a parent can teach a child. It's
not as easy as simply looking some-
thing up in a guidebook, but it's much
more effective. Values keep children
safe and on track and also teach them
to do things independently. When
parents teach values. They don't tell
their children what to think. They
tell them how to think. That makes
all the difference.
My father taught me to ride a bicy-
cle without training wheels when I
was four years old. My brother and
I ate a lot of ice cream. Despite that,
we turned out all right. So, parents:
throw out those guidebooks and chill
a little.

'Castle' suffers
from crime drama
conventions
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily Arts Writer
It's hard not to cringe when
hearing the phrase "crime
drama." The
words con- **

urban settings, Castle

ers, melodra- 10p.m.
matic music, ABC
poor acting
and plots no one cares about or
understands.
ABC's "Castle" is a crime
drama with all the fixings, but its
unique premise may just be pow-
erful enough to set it apart from
the tired genre.
Crime fiction novelist Richard
Castle (Nathan Fillion, "Wait-
ress") is a successful, arrogant
womanizer suffering from writ-

er's block. When a series of mur-
ders pop up that are imitations
of the murders in his novels, he
is enlisted by the smart, no-non-
sense NYPD detective Kate Beck-
ett (Stana Katic, "Feast of Love")
for help in the investigation.
Though Beckett prefers to
work without interference or
distractions, Castle can't help
but give his input - whether or
not it's desired. When Castle's
sense of narrative helps him dis-
cover the police have arrested
the wrong guy, Beckett is con-
vinced to put aside her differenc-
es with him. Once she does, the
duo works wonderfully together
and manages to bring down the
real imitator. In the process,
Castle gets inspiration for a new
character based on Beckett, and
he'll spend the rest of the season
working with her as "research"
for his book.
The show's most nauseat-
ingly conventional element is
Beckett and Castle's relation-
ship. He flirts shamelessly and
makes blatant advances while
she turns him down with snide

and witty retorts. Yet she's a fan
of his books, and it's obvious she
has a soft spot for him when the
camera catches her staring at
him all the time. Some subtlety
and originality would've been
useful.
Fortunately, Castle's relation-
ship with the rest of the cast is
refreshingly unique. His mother,
Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan,
"The Nine"), is a lively retiree
who chases men as though she
were 40 years younger. Serving
as a foil to Castle and his mother's
carefree attitude, Castle's teen-
age daughter Alexis (newcomer
Molly C. Quinn) is grounded and
sensible even with her less-than-
ideal role models.
Despite disapproving of their
ways, Alexis still maintains a
loving relationship with her
guardians. Because of these
mixed-up roles, there's virtually
no hierarchy in the Castle family.
With three different generations
of Castle treating one another
as peers, the interactions are
refreshingly colorful,
with that in mind, there

should've been more screen time
devoted to these unique support-
ing characters. Instead, "Cas-
tle" focuses on the police force,
where it rehashes the stereo-
typical detective roles complete
with obnoxiously cheesy writ-
ing - bad one-liners are the most
common form of dialogue in the
hour-long program. The NYPD
detectives make unnecessary
jokes at every occasion, especial-
ly crime scenes. But thankfully,
while this type of conventional
crime drama humor dominates
the show, there are still a few
genuinely funny and original
moments. Just not enough.
"Castle" is a crime drama, and
it embraces all the conventions
the genre has become infamous
for - but it still has a chance to
succeed. Though its romantic
sub-plot is too prominent and
the writing is often contrived,
the show still has potential. The
upcoming episodes need to focus
more on Castle's writing career
and the refreshing supporting
cast if "Castle" is to be saved
from the worn-out genre.


ARTS IN BRIEF

f Film Review
'Miss March' misses
the humor mark
. "Miss March"
20th Century Fox/Jacobson
At Quality 16 and Showcase
Even when considering how
regrettably lowthe standards ofcom-
edy have fallen in recent years, it is
rare to find a comedy in which all (or
nearly all) of the humor is the unin-
tentional result of bad acting. But
"Miss March" is just such a disaster,
as it unsuccessfully attempts to elicit
laughter by the most horrifically
offensive means possible.
The film was written and directed
by Trevor Moore and Zach Creg-
ger ("The Whitest Kids U' Know").
The plot follows a teenager named

Eugene (Cregger) who, by a wacky
turn of events, slips into a coma for
four years. When he wakes up, he
discovers his former girlfriend Cindi
(Raquel Alessi, "Summerhood") has
left him and ascended the ranks of
Playboy fame. He then proceeds to
go on a cross country trip with his
lifelong friend Tucker (Moore) to
win her affections a second time.
Perhaps the most painful aspect
of the film is Moore's wholly
unfunny portrayal of the typical
"best bud" character. His method
of comic delivery involves nothing
more than a bug-eyed reaction to all
of his surroundings, coupled with
a faux-effeminate vocal inflection
that's far more annoying than it is
humorous.
A $10 share in General Motor's
failing stock is a more viably profit-
able investment than the $10 it would
cost to see this movie in theaters.

his is much like how noise makes
ore aware that they are participat-
of auditory expression.

Noise music is. about breaking music and
sound down into their smallest components
and using components not considered to be a
part of the normal catalog.
But Coates explained that, apart from the
theoretical back-and-forth about what defines
noise music, the genre also has a very practical
application. In particular, Coates is interested
in bringing noise music to elementary and pre-
schools as a way to widen the scope of music
education.
"An important part of playing music is
improvisation," Coates said. "One of the major
barriers to improvising classically is that you
need to be really proficient. Having a teacher
yell at you to keep your elbow under the instru-
ment just doesn't happen in noise. Noise can
teach kids to improvise fairly easier."
He added, "I think that part of the play-
ful process is really important to the creative
process and when compared with traditional
music education, that is lacking."
Another important aspect of noise music is
how the listener is affected. On the Facebook
group, some listeners have said that they feel
like "vomit." Others have described a "distur-
bance, and (an) instinct to protect one's ears."
But those only are referring to the loud type of
ear-grating noise.
I have had the experience of near-medita-

one end product, but rather a series of different
production methods, it is hard to define any
one listener's experience as typical.
"Sometimes the best part of noise is right
when it stops," Goldstein said. "You suddenly
hear the pipes in the room, the water rush
through them, or you are hearing your own
heartbeat again which you ignored before or
you hear all the cloth in your clothes just sort
of chaffing,"
Coates, on the other hand, has a different
listener experience.
"The most common feelingI have when lis-
tening to noise is 'FUCK YEAH."'
I would have to agree - both are extremely
accurate descriptions.

When even the preteen Flavor Flav is shocked, you know some shit has gone down.

FIRST ROUND
From Page 1
37 seconds left, Harris drove
through a crowded lane. After his
fouled bank shot bounced slowly
from the glass through the net,
Harris flexed his arms inward and
growled with utter enthusiasm.
"I probably look at him and say,
'You have a great shot here, it's got
tobe like a layup," Michigancoach
John Beilein said. "But when
Manny gets into crowds, those are
like layups to him."
When Harris runs into traffic
in front of the net, he delivers. And
when the Wolverines get into big-
game situations, they deliver.
They've done it with their backs
against the wall all season, most
notably in late-season wins over
Tournament teams Purdue and
Minnesota.
They weren't expected to do it
DANCE MARATHON
From Page 1
person for CMN," Peguese said.
The University of Michigan
Dance Marathonis one of thelargest
non-profit, student-run organiza-
tions in Michigan. It raises aware-
ness and funds for children in need
of pediatric care and assistance.
This weekend, hundreds of
students will stand on their feet
for 30 hours to raise money for
families like the Pegueses. The
annual marathon starts at 10 a.m.
Saturday and will go until 4 p.m.
Sunday.
The Peguese family has been a
fixture at the marathon for seven
years, but Andrea will never forget
the first time she attended.
"I lead with my heart, and
something in me just said do it, it
sounds like it'd be fun," she said.
"I didn't expect the emotion that
the students were going through.
It's huge that they were impacted
so deeply, their passion just really
burned through. And to stand on
your feet for 30 hours you have to
have a lot of passion."
Hilary Powsner, UMDM's
media relations coordinator, said
the dance marathon is a "tribute"
to the children they help.
"We are standing for those who
cannot stand," she said. "The out-
pouring of support that our orga-
nizationboth gives and receives is,
at least for me, the biggest reason
why I stay involved."
Peguese said that she not only
appreciates the students' passion,
but also their ability to show her
children a good time during the
marathon.
"Ihave foundthat the adults are
the ones that have problems deal-
ing with people with disabilities,"
she said. "And this (UMDM) was
an opportunity that allowed us to
interact with a great number of
people at one time. And they never
questioned what is their disabil-

yesterday, but they did.
And theylbe there Saturdayo
take on No.2 seed Oklahoma.
Believe it or not, the team that
went 10-22 last season is now
playing in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament. People might
have already given Saturday's
game to the Sooners. But talk to
Michigan, and just a first-round
win still isn't enough.
"As ateam, we want to stay inthe
tournament," Sims said. "It wasn't
a compliment for us to make it."
But it was a compliment to
a success-starved fanbase that
finally had the chance to pick
Michigan in its NCAA Tourna-
ment brackets.
So go ahead and move the Wol-
verines forward on your bracket.

ity or what's wrong with them. It
was just accepted and that breaks
down the barriers."
Powsner said that interacting
with the families is part of what
makes the marathon such a mean-
ingful experience.
"When you have a tO-year-old
kid who is just so excited to be
a part of this event, it is impos-
sible to put into words how right it
feels," she said.
The Ham-Kucharskis are
another family that students will
have a chance to interact with at
Dance Marathon. Dawn and her
husband Richard have one child, a
10-year-old son named Alex.
Alex suffered a stroke at birth
and has autism and cerebral palsy.
He has beeninvolved withUMDM
for the past eight years and Dawn
said the organization has given
him the opportunity to become
more comfortable interacting with
others.
"Thanks to the social and rec-
reational opportunities offered
to Alex in his eight years of love
and acceptance with UMDM, he
now goes everywhere happily, and
loves malls, restaurants, parties,"
she said. "His old behaviors are
practically non-existent."
Dawn added that every time
they go to the marathon, it causes
"tears and laughter." She said she
has a lot of appreciation for the
students who participate.
"I can't even put into words
how much I love and admire
these students," she said. "When
I was a student, I never thought
I could give so much. I see that
they see school as a place where
they can not only get a degree but
also make an impact."
Peguese said she is excited for
the weekend because it provides
her family with a short escape
from reality.
"It's a relief. It's a safe weekend.
It's a safe interaction for all the
children and all the families," she
said.

contributions to health benefits

Regent Andrea Fischer-New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) said she
supported the group's proposal
because it considered state fund-
ing levels.
"I personally think it's a rational
proposal," she said.
Provost Teresa Sullivan said
a tuition freeze would limit the
University's ability to increase
services, including financial
aid.
"It also means you can't do any-
thing different next year, you can't
have any more financial aid," she
said. "We haven't made a decision
yet."
Sullivan said that while some
students are experiencing addition-
al financial constraints due to the
state of the economy, there are also
students who can still afford to pay
higher tuition rates.
"To me, the most important
thing is there's nothing more for
financial aid, at a time when there
are certainly students who need it
and there are still students in the
student body who can pay it," she
said. ,

University President Mary Sue
Coleman announced a new cost-
sharing plan yesterday, in which
University employees will pay
more for their health benefits
next year.
Speaking at the monthly meeting
of the University Board of Regents,
Coleman said the new cost-sharing
plan will help the University cope
with the financial strain employee
benefit packages are putting on the
its finances.
"Simply put, our health care
costs will paralyze the University
of Michigan unless we take action,"
Coleman told the regents. "In 20
years, it would consume our entire
budget."
Despite the change - which
will increase employee contribu-
tions from approximately 20 to
30 percent - Coleman stressed
that it would not affect the qual-
ity of employees' benefit pack-
ages.
"I want to be clear about
one essential fact in this new
approach," she said. "We are not
changing benefits for employees

or retirees."
The initiative to increase
employee contributions to health
plans was announced last fall,
although specific details were not
made public. According to Cole-
man, University employees will
receive an e-mail today outlining,
the details.
Regents approve eight
honorarydegrees
The University Board of
Regents also unanimously
approved eight honorary degrees
to be awarded this spring at the
University's various commence-
ment ceremonies.
Six of the honorary degrees will
be awarded at the University's
graduation ceremonies in Ann
Arbor this spring.
Donald Graham, for whom the
University's recently established
Graham Environmental Sustain-
ability institute is named, will
receive a Doctor of Engineer-
ing degree. Michael Posner, who

cises on May 1, will receive a

and donations into his personal
checking account.
Averill said she realized the funds
were not in the proper account Sun-
day when Baydoun mentioned he
still had to write a check for UMDM,
which will take place this weekend.
But when Averill confronted Bay-
doun about the funds by e-mail and
in person, she said Baydoun still
failed to deposit the money.
After pressure from the MSA
executiveboard,Baydoundeposited
the funds into the proper account
Wednesday morning, about five
months after the money was raised,
Shingwani said.
one of the charges Benson filed
against Baydoun was for embezzle-
ment, but CSJ dropped the charge.
Baydoun said he was happy CSJ
dropped the embezzlement charge
and was confident tomorrow's trial
would show no purposefully harm-
ful intentions on his part.
"I can definitely say that there has
been no malicious intent onmy part,"
Baydoun said. "And I think we will
see this tomorrow atthe CSJ case."
Shingwani said she believes this
might have been a simple oversight,
but that it's still MSA's responsibility to
carry out the proper legal processes.
"Although this could be consid-
ered an honest mistake, we have to
acknowledge that there was still a
wrongdoing," she said. "We want to
be as open and transparent as possi-
ble, and it's MSA's responsibility to go
throughthe properjudicial process."
Because the pre-trial took place
before the election results were
released, two of the actions against
Baydoun had to do with the elec-
tion, but both were withdrawn.
One of the withdrawn actions
attempted to remove Baydoun from
theballot,negatinghiscandidacy.The
other action filed requested a tem-
porary restraining order against the
student government election board,
which would have kept the results of
the hotly contested elections internal
until a resolution was reached or the
48-hour window ended.

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
You're restless and full of bright ideas
today. In fact, you can barely sit still.
Perhaps this is because you. have a
secret? Ah ha!
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
You might meet someoneunusual
today. Alternatively, someone you
already 'know might do something a bit
bizarre or unconventional, and this com-
pletely surprises you.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Bosses, parents and VIPs are com-
pletely unpredictable today. Knowing
this, stay on your toes and be prepared to
jump in either direction. (Yikes!)
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
Sudden changes or delays with travel
plans or something having to do with
higher education, publishing and the
media can occur today. They might be an
opportunity or an obstacle.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
The generosity of someone might sur-
prise you today. Expect gifts, goodies
and favors from others. Who knew?
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Close friends and partners are rebel-
lious and very independent today. Others
might do something that surprises you.
(Nobody expects the Spanish
Inquisition!)
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Surprises at work might occur today
due to staff shortages, computer crashes,
power outages or unexpected delays.
Stay on your toes. Who knows what will
ha ppen ne ?
SCORIOI
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
The introduction of new technology

you're doing today, especially related to
sports or taking care of children or the
arts and show business. (How tech-
savvy are you?)
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Unexpected company might drop by
today at home. Or expected company

family likely will occur. Guard against
breakages.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
You're full of bright, geniuslike ideas
today. Nevertheless, this is a mildly acci-
dent-prone day - be careful. Something
related to electronics and high-tech
equipment could break down today.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Trust your moneymaking ideas. Some
of you are ready to strike out on your
own and explore self-employment. (It's
all very exciting!) If shopping, keep your

unpredictable today.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to.March 20)

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Harris leads 'M' to Tourney win

By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The
Michigan men's basketball team
saw its NCAA Tournament hopes
melting before its eyes.
After earning their first bid to
the Big Dance in 11 years, the Wol-
verines nearly let a 16-point lead
against Clemson slip away down
the stretch.
That was until sophomore for-
ward Manny Harris put Michi-
gan's
postsea- MICHIGAN 62
son fate CLEMSON 59
squarely
on his shoulders in the final min-
ute of the game.
As he jumped to the basket with
37 seconds left, he and the 10th-
seeded Wolverines rose above
beingthe underdogsinyesterday's
game and rose above demons of
the program's past. And with one
flick of the wrist, Harris sealed
Michigan's first tournament win
in over a decade.
He drew a foul and banked in a
shot in the lane to propel the Wol-
verines to a 62-59 win over No. 7
seed Clemson last night. Harris
scored 23 points, dished six assists
and grabbed seven rebounds.
"Manny did tonight what he
was doing all year," fifth-year
senior guard C.J Lee said. "We
ask so much from him on a daily
basis. He did a remarkable job of
knowing when it was his time to
takeover."
The win is Michigan's first
tournament victory since it
knocked off Davidson in the first
round in 1998.

"Finally," redshirt sophomore
Anthony Wright said. "This is
just for the team, the coaches,
Ann Arbor, the state of Michi-
gan. Just giving back to the fans
because they've been waiting for
this opportunity and it's good to
just give it back to them."
 But that "finally" almost didn't
happen. The Wolverines barely
made the field of 65, but they ral-
lied by reeling off six wins in their
last nine games. And if Michigan
lost, many fans still would have
viewed this season as a success.
"To a lot of people, it probably
feels like that," Harris said. "To
ourselves, we expected to win."
For much of the second half, it
looked like the Wolverines would
cruise to a victory. With 12:51
left in the second half, Michigan
held a 16-point lead and seemed
unstoppable.
The 16-4 run by the Wolverines
to start the half climaxed when
Clemson guard Terrence Oglesby,
the team's third-leading scorer,
was ejected for elbowing fresh-
man Stu Douglass.
It was a feeling with which
Michigan could empathize. Har-
ris was ejected for elbowing Pur-
due's Chris Kramer in the face
earlier in the season.
"It's frustrating," Harris said.
"You know there's nothing you
can do at that point. The only
thing you can do is pray and hope
that your team can win."
But any prayers by Oglesby
were nearly answered.
In a span of one minute and
23 seconds, Clemson hit three
3-pointers to cut its deficit to six.
"It was a quick thought when

they started making the run, that
'Hey, this could be the last time,' "
fifth-year senior guard David
Merritt said.
The Tigers grabbed five offen-
sive rebounds and center Trevor
Booker scored six points in the
last three minutes to cut Michi-
gan's lead to just one before Har-
ris hit his floater.
Clemson's domination of the
glass piqued at the end, but it was
a problem for the Wolverines all
night. On a possession in the first
half, the Tigers grabbed three
offensive rebounds.
Beilein was furious, direct-
ing his anger at Sims, who wasn't
crashing the boards for rebounds.
"E'very time the ball goes up,'
you're getting out of there," Bei-
lein said as Sims came to the
bench.
Clemson out-rebounded the
Wolverines 44-33, including 21-9
on the offensive glass.
But Beilein has stressed all
season he doesn't mind being out-
rebounded if his team is making
shots.
And the Wolverines did just
that. Led by Harris, who hit 7-of-
15 attempts, Michigan made 39.2
of its shots. Clemson finished with
a 32.3 field-goal percentage.
The Wolverines will face No.
2 seed Oklahoma in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament
at 5:50 p.m. Saturday.
And though the Sooners boast
Player of the Year candidate Blake
Griffin, the Wolverines don't
expect to lose.
"We're not just here to win
one," Merritt said. "We're here to
win another one."

Tt ---e I..t An v:t nA 0

Wolverines (21-13) will have their
hands full during their second-
round game on Saturday.
The seventh-ranked Sooners
(28-5) are led by Blake Griffin, a
candidate for NCAA Player of the
Year and the possible No. 1 pick
in the NBA Draft. The 6-foot-
10 power forward averages 21.9
points and 14.3 rebounds per
game.
Michigan doesn't have a single
player who matches up well with
Griffin, so the Wolverines will
probably look to contain him as a
team.
Michigan will likely deploy
an array of defensive schemes to
slow him.
After winning 25 of its first 26
games, Oklahoma lost four of its
last six to limp into the NCAA
Tournament. The Sooners' most
recent loss was by one point to
Oklahoma State in the Big 12
Tournament quarterfinals.
"It'll be a great matchup," red-
shirt sophomore Anthony Wright
said. "Once again, two contrast-
ing styles. And we'll see whatever
coach has planned for us after
tonight."
Roh A -:os nA T nn c A -

team will enjoy the win, but will
quickly shift its focus toward
Oklahoma. Michigan coach John
Beilein had three full days to pre-
pare for Clemson and its quick
full-court press. Now he has part
of Thursday night, Friday and
part of Saturday to prepare for
one of the nation's best teams.
And Griffin isn't Oklahoma's lone
weapon.
Big 12 Freshman of the Year
Willie Warren plays sidekick to
Griffin. Warren averages 14.7
points per game and is one of the
best guards in the conference.
He's quick, physical and scored
20 or more points in seven differ-
ent occasions.
Blake's older brother, Taylor,
brings down six rebounds per
game and scores 9.6 per contest.
And 6-foot-3 point guard Austin
Johnson is tied for 15th in the
nation with an assist-to-turnover
ratio of 2.55:1.
The Sooners are coached by
former Duke star Jeff Capel, who
has taken Oklahoma to a new level
in just his third season.
Michigan could have come to
Kansas City and been satisfied
with just making the Big Dance
for the first time in 11 years.
And although the Wolverines
came here to win, Saturday's
contest won't be easy.
"Obviously, we're going to
enjoy this now," Lee said. "But
after today, it's over. We're
onto our next game. Like we
said before Clemson, the only
game we're guaranteed is our
next one. Our focus needs to
start when we get back to the
hotel."

CLIF REED R/D

Hogan key to CCH A playoff run

By CHRIS MESZAROS
DailySports Writer
This weekend's CCHA Champi-
onship at Joe Louis Arena will be a
battleground for top goaltenders.
One of them was named CCHA
Player of the Year - Alaska's Chad
Johnson.
Another was a finalist for the
award - Notre Dame's Jordan
Pearce.
The third nearly single-handedly
brought his team from last place in
the CCHA to the conference tourna-
ment semifinals - Northern Michi-
gan's Brian Stewart.
And then there's Michigan soph-
omore Bryan Hogan.
Although Hogan certainly isn't
a slouch among this group of all-
star goalies, he's the most over-
looked of the four. The Wolverines'
CCHA-best 140 goals on the season
overshadow Hogan's .917 save per-
centage.
The fourth-ranked Wolverines
(20-8-0 CCHA, 28-10-0 overall)
will face Alaska, led by Johnson and
his conference-leading .939 save
percentage, in the CCHA semifinals

tonight.
"I'm not on all the media pipe-
lines, soI can't tell you who's talking
about who," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "But I like Hogie.
If I had a choice of the goalies, I'd
take him. Obviously Chad Johnson's
had a terrific year and has been an
important player from Alaska, but
not the only reason."
Last weekend,in the Wolverines'
CCHA Tournament quarterfinals
sweep against Western Michigan,
there were times it seemed like
Hogan could fall asleep in the net.
Hogan didn't face any shots in the
first period of Saturday's game and
stopped just 32 in the entire series.
On the other hand, Bronco goalten-
der Riley Gill faced 103 total shots
from the Wolverines on the week-
end.
But Hogan said he'd rather face
a higher number of shots.
"Every once in a while, you'd
love to steal a game, but with us,
it's a tough game to play," Hogan
said. "Billy (Sauer) and I talk about
it - how we only get 15 to 18 shots
a game now in the playoffs. And
of course, the other goalie looks


like he's having a really hard time
down there. But I think we get
overlooked by the fact that we're in
a tough position because we're try-
ing to stay in the game and have to
make one or two big stops to keep
our team in it."
Once again Hogan probably
won't face too many shots tonight.
Alaska (13-10-5-3, 17-14-6) is 11th
of the 12 CCHA teams in goals per
game. But in both of the Nanooks'
wins against Ohio State last week-
end, the defense led the way, shut-
ting down the Buckeyes in 4-0 and
1-0 wins.
There's no question Michigan
has the offense to advance far into
the NCAA playoffs, but the ques-
tion remains if Hogan is up to the
task of stealing a game if the Wol-
verines need it down the stretch.
"He's going to do the best he can
to keep the puck out of our own
net," junior co-captain Chris Sum-
mers said. "Whether we're scoring
up front or not, his main focus is
defense first. Obviously he has to
rely on us to put the pucks in but
he's just got to do his job and keep
pucks out."
