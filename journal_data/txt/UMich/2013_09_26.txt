RESEARCH
Stats prof.
recipient of
MacArthur
Fellowship

'Genius grant' will
fund further work
on evaluating
chronic disorders
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
Statistics Prof. Susan Murphy
- who also serves as a psychiatry
professor and research professor
in the Institute for Social Research
- has received a MacArthur Fel-
lowship, or "genius grant," for her
innovative development of new
methods to evaluate treatment for
individuals dealing with chronic
or relapsing disorders, such as
alcoholism.
The 24 MacArthur Fellows also
includes a photographer, choreog-
rapher, chemist and atomic physi-
cist, among others. The fellows
each receive a $625,000 stipend
that they are free to spend as they
choose.
Murphy, who found out she was
receiving the fellowship about a

week ago, said her treatment meth-
ods are innovative in that they are
constantly refined to fit the evolv-
ing needs of individuals, rather
than following a static treatment
model.
Were constantly trying to re-
individualize, re-personalize, to
the person," Murphy said.
The John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation, an
independent foundation that
supports development of knowl-
edge to improve public policy
and the public's access to infor-
mation, awards the fellowships
annually.
The MacArthur Fellowship is
awarded to individuals who "have
shown extraordinary originality
and dedication in their creative
pursuits and a marked capac-
ity for self-direction," accord-
ing to the award's website. The
fellowship is not awarded for
past achievements, but rather an
investment in the potential of the
recipients.

alized treatment methods to the

North Quad Residential Hall
now has competition on Cen-
tral Campus.
Nearly one month after East
Quad Residence Hall reopened
following an exhaustive

$116-million renovation started
in May 2012, a crowd of stu-
dents, administrators and Resi-
dence Hall staff gathered at the
refurbished building Wednes-
day to celebrate its completion.
The event was held through-
out East Quad: A band played
near the cafe where snacks
were served, an a cappella
group sang in Green Lounge,
and top administrators, includ-
ing University President Mary
Sue Coleman, spoke outside in
the courtyard.

The project - part of the
immense Residential Life ini-
tiative that has seen the renova-
tion of many residence halls on
campus - overhauled almost
all aspects of the building and
simplified the layout.
2012's reopening of Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall, the reno-
vation of Mosher-Jordan Resi-
dence Hall, completed in 2008,
Stockwell in 2009 and the more
limited, current renovation of
South Quad Residence Hall
have been part of the same ini-

tiative. West Quad Residence
Hall's renovation, set to begin
in May 2014, will be the last
phase of the project.
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president of stu-
dent affairs, said despite the
changes, which included the
conversion of the Halfway Inn
performance space into a kitch-
en, the building retains the
same cultural aesthetic.

Wi-Fi woes on the mend

November trip
timed several days
after start of new
capital campaign
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Though she has already trav-
eled to four international des-
tinations during her tenure,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman has one last stop before
her retirement in July: India.
On Nov. 11, just days after
the launch of the University's
upcoming capital campaign,
Coleman will travel to New Delhi
and Mumbai to engage with civic
and academic leaders, businesses
and alumni.
With each activity, Coleman
said she hopes to create and
enhance connections in social-
science research, medical sci-
ences, business, and educational
opportunities, among others.
During her tenure, Coleman has
also visited Brazil, Ghana, South

Africa and China on behalf of the
University.
"What I really hope is that we
provide more opportunities for
ourstudentsto reallygo and have
a really robust experience," Cole-
man said in a mid-September
interview. "India is, by popula-
tion, a huge democracy; it's got
growing pains, a rapidly growing
economy and real issues. I think
there's a rich area for our stu-
dents to engage."
Collectively, students from
India are the fourth-largest con-
tingent of international students
at the University. Coleman said
she hopes to strengthen the Uni-
versity's existing connections
and develop more opportunities
for students to experience the
nation themselves.
A group that included James
Holloway, vice provost for glob-
al and engaged education, and
Political Science prof. Mark Tes-
sler, former vice provost for glob-
al and engaged education, began
to plan the trip more than a year
ago.

Students report
frequent wireless
Internet outages
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
For the Daily
Since the school year
began, a ubiquitous groan
has echoed throughout cam-
pus as the University Wi-Fi
network, MWireless, seems
to regularly disconnect, peri-
odically leaving students and

faculty without Internet.
Andrew Palms, the Uni-
versity's executive director of
communications systems and
data centers, said the connec-
tion issues were aggravated
over a five-day period rough-
ly a week and a half ago, when
the system was going through
growing pains.
"The number of connec-
tions for Wi-Fi doubled from
last year to this year, and gen-
erally we expect an increase
of about 30- to 40-percent
growth in total," Palms said.

Palms said there was
more traffic than the net-
work's switches and rout-
ers could handle. However,
after swapping out the cen-
tral equipment to add more
capacity, Palms said problems
with slow or even dropped
connections should, for the
most part, be fixed.
Although the ITS has
seemingly fixed the issues
plaguing the large group of
users, Palms explained that

Iran expresses increased desire
to revive nuclear negociations

a

President Rouhani:
We have nothing
to hide from world
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Iran showed new urgency
Wednesday to revive stalled
negotiations with six world
powers over its disputed nuclear
activities, seeking to ease crip-
pling international sanctions as
quickly as possible.
New Iranian President Hasan
Rouhani said "we have nothing
to hide" as diplomats prepared to
meet Thursday to discuss the way
forward on the negotiations that
have been on hold since April.
Rouhani's Foreign Minister
Javad Zarif, who has been tasked
as the lead nuclear negotiator,
said he hoped his counterparts
from six world powers - the
U.S., Britain, France, Russia,
China and Germany - "have the
same political will as we do to
start serious negotiations with

a view to reaching an agree-
ment within the shortest span of
time."
Zarif will be a part of the
Thursday meeting to discuss the
next round of negotiations in
Geneva, expected in October.
The West suspects Iran is
trying to build a nuclear weap-
on and has imposed crippling
sanctions on Tehran that have
slashed its vital oil exports and
severely restricted its interna-
tional bank transfers. Inflation
has surged and the value of the
local currency has plunged.
Tehran has repeatedly denied
that its nuclear program is for
anything other than peaceful
purposes.
But since his June election,
Rouhani has made clear he is
seeking relief from the sanctions
and has welcomed a new start
in nuclear negotiations in hopes
this could ease the economic
pressure. He has said he has the
full support of Iranian Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khame-

S *OU

nei, who has the final word on
all important matters of state
including the nuclear file.
"If there is political will onthe
other side, which we think there
is, we are ready to talk," Rouhani
told editors Wednesday in New
York on the sidelines of the Unit-
ed Nations General Assembly.
"We believe the nuclear issue
will be solved by negotiation."
In his debut speech to world
leaders at the U.N. on Tuesday,
Rouhani repeated Iran's long-
standing demand that any nucle-
ar agreement must recognize its
right under international trea-
ties to continue enriching urani-
um. The U.S. and its allies have
long demanded a halt to enrich-
ment, fearing Tehran could
secretly build nuclear warheads.
Uranium enriched to low lev-
els can be used as fuel for nucle-
ar energy but at higher levels of
enrichment, it could be used to
build a nuclear weapon.
Rouhani also insisted in his
speech that any deal be contin-
gent on all other nations declar-
ing their nuclear programs too
are solely for peaceful purposes
- alluding to the U.S. and Israel.
Iran watchers say Rouhani
may have limited time to reach
a settlement - possibly a year or
less - before Khamenei decides
negotiations are fruitless. That
could explain the urgency in Zar-
if's call to reach a deal quickly.
"He is not negotiating for the
sake of negotiating and dragging
it out," Haleh Esfandiari, direc-
tor of the Mideast program at
the Wilson Center think-tank
in Washington, said of Rouhani.
"His reputation, and the country's
reputation, is at stake. This is an
issue they are willing to work on,
and move to take concrete steps to
serious negotiations."
Rouhani in New York has
come across as a more moder-
ate face of the hard-line clerical
regime in Tehran. In particular,
he appears to be trying to tone
down the caustic rhetoric of his
predecessor, Mahmoud Ahma-
dinejad, with regard to Israel -
one of the points of friction in
relations with the West.

ISS, blasts off at the Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, Thursday,

Mission to include
spacewalk with
Olympic torch
MOSCOW (AP) - A Soyuz
spacecraft carrying two Rus-
sians and an American lifted
off early Thursday from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome, soaring
into the night sky for a six-hour
trip to the International Space
Station. Their six-month mission
will include a spacewalk with
the Olympic torch.
NASA's Michael Hopkins
and Russian cosmonauts Oleg
Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky will

orbit the Earth four times in the
cramped capsule before docking
at the orbiting outpost.
Live coverage provided by
NASA TV showed the launch
went off as scheduled shortly
before 1 a.m. Moscow time on
Thursday (2100GMT, 5 p.m.
EDT Wednesday). Less than 10
minutes into the flight, a NASA
commentator said the Soyuz had
reached orbit after an "unevent-
ful and successful" launch from
the cosmodrome, which Russia
leases in Kazakhstan.
During a spacewalk in
November, the two Russians
will have the honor of taking the
Olympic torch into open space

as part of the relay of the Olym-
pic flame ahead of the Winter
Games being held in Sochi in
February. The torch will not be
lit, however, because of safety
concerns and will only arrive at
the station in Novemberwiththe
next crew.
"We will take a picture of it
with the space station in the
background, with the Earth in
the background, and we will try
to make sure that we see Rus-
sia, and maybe Sochi where the
Olympic Games will take place,"
Kotov, a veteran of two previ-
ous six-month missions, said in
an interview posted on NASA's
website.

FBI agents work in Kenyan mall

a

Began fingerprint,
DNA analysis amid
destruction
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -
Working near bodies crushed
by rubble in a bullet-scarred,
scorched mall, FBI agents began
fingerprint, DNA and ballis-
tic analysis Wednesday to help
determine the identities and
nationalities of victims and al-

Shabab gunmen who attacked
the shopping center, killing more
than 60 people.
A gaping hole in the mall's
roof was caused by Kenyan sol-
diers who fired rocket-propelled
grenades inside, knocking out a
support column, a government
official told The Associated
Press. The official, who insisted
he not be identified because he
was sharing security informa-
tion, said the soldiers fired to
distract a terrorist sniper so hos-

tages could be evacuated.
Video, of the roof collapse
showed massive carnage. The
collapse came Monday, shortly
after four large explosions rang
out followed by billows of black
smoke. Although a govern-
ment minister said the terror-
ists had set mattresses on fire,
causing the roof to collapse,
the video showed such massive
destruction that the explana-
tion seemed unlikely to be the
full story.

Earthquake off
Pakistani coast
creates island
Alongside the carnage of Paki-
stan's massive earthquake came
a new creation: a small island
of mud, stone and bubbling gas
pushed forth from the seabed.
Experts say the island was
formed by the massive movement
of the earth during the 7.7-mag-
nitude quake that hit Pakistan's
Baluchistan province on Tuesday,
killing at least 285 people.
"That big shock beneath the
earth causes a lot of disturbance,"
said Zahid Rafi, director of the
National Seismic Monitoring
Center.
The island appeared off the
coast of Gwadar, a port about 330
miles (533 kilometers) from Paki-
stan's largest city of Karachi and
75 miles (120 kilometers) from

Iran.
DAKAR, Senegal
Water cuts shorten
UN visit
For nearly two weeks, Dakar
residents have bathed in the
ocean, dug makeshift wells along
the beach and waited in long lines
near distribution trucks in search
of water that is no longer running
from the taps.
The capital city's poor outer
suburbs and wealthy expatriate
neighborhoods alike have been
affected by water cuts that offi-
cials blame on faulty equipment
located hundreds of kilometers
away.
Frustration with the govern-
S ment has mounted daily-com-
pounded by the fact that Senegal
is in the middle of the rainy sea-
son and large sections of the
city are simultaneously dealing
with flooding. Though water and
power cuts are common in devel-
 oping countries, a two-week cut in
services is unprecedented in Sen-
egal, and young men have burned
tires in the streets in protest.

Russia expects a resolution
on Syria within two days

Chemical weapons
to be dismantled
under agreement
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.N. Security Council, long
paralyzed by deep divisions
over how to deal with the Syrian
conflict, is about two days away
from agreeing on a resolution to
require Damascus to dismantle
its chemical weapons stock-
piles, Russia's deputy foreign
minister said Wednesday.
Gennady Gatilov told The
Associated Press that the text
of the resolution will include
a reference to Chapter 7 of the
U.N. Charter, which allows
for military and nonmilitary
actions to promote peace and
security.
But he stressed that there
will not be an automatic trig-
ger for such measures, which
means the council will have to
follow up with another resolu-
tion if Syria fails to comply.
The U.S. and Russia had been
at odds on how to enforce the
resolution. U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry and Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov

met for nearly 90 minutes at the
United Nations, and American
officials said that while there
had been progress in some
areas, they couldn't agree on the
text, which the U.S. had been
insisting be enforceable.
President Barack Obama's
threatened U.S. strikes against
President Bashar Assad's
regime following an Aug. 21
suspected poison gas attack
has led to a flurry of diplomatic
activity. Kerry made a surprise
offer that Syria could avert
U.S. military action by turn-
ing over "every single bit of his
chemical weapons" to interna-
tional control within a week.
Russia, Syria's most important
ally, and Assad's government
quickly agreed on the broad
proposal, but it has taken time
and tough negotiations to
work out the details.
The five permanent veto-
wielding members of the Secu-
rity Council - the U.S., Russia,
China, Britain and France -
known as the P-S have been
discussing for the past few
weeks what to include in a new
resolution requiringthat Syria's
chemical weapons stockpile be

secured and dismantled. The
council has been blocked on
Syria, with Russia and China
vetoing three Western-backed
resolutions aimed at pressuring
President Bashar Assad to end
the violence which has killed
over 100,000 people.
But Gatilov told AP the nego-
tiations are "going quite well"
and the draft resolution should
be finalized "very soon - with-
in the next two day, I think."
As for Chapter 7, he said, "It
will be mentioned but there is
the understanding, of course,
(that) there is no automaticity in
engaging Chapter 7."
Britain's U.N. Ambassador
Mark Lyall Grant also reported
progress.
"We are still working in the
P-5 constructively on a text," he
told AP.
"But there are still some dif-
ferences," Lyall Grant said. "We
hope to be able to iron them
out, maybe even today, but cer-
tainly in the next few days so
that we can adopt a resolution
- a strong binding enforceable
resolution with a united voice of
the Security Council as soon as
possible."

Mixed reactions
globally to security
change proposal
NEW YORK (AP) - Some
malls around the world have been
scramblingto add securityguards
to look for suspicious people fol-
lowing a deadly attack on a shop-
ping center in Nairobi over the
weekend. But for other malls, it's
been business as usual.
The mixed reactions by malls
across the globe isn't unusual
in an industry whose secu-
rity efforts vary from unarmed
guards in most shopping centers
in the U.S. to metal detectors and
bag searches in places like Israel
to main entrances that resemble
airport security lines in India.
The disparity offers a glimpse of
why any moves following the Nai-
robi incident to increase mall secu-
rityin countriesthat have less strict
procedures aren't likely to last: The
industry continues to struggle with
how to keep shoppers safe without
scaringthem away.
"No one wants, when you go
shopping, to be strip searched,
to be interviewed in a room by a
security guard," said Simon Ben-
nett, director, Civil Safety and
Security Unit at the University of
Leicester in England. "That might
be acceptable in aviation, but it is
not in commercial retail."
Security concerns come after
12 to 15 militants from the Somali
Islamic extremist group al-Sha-
bab, wielding grenades, took con-
trol of the upscale Westgate mall
in Nairobi. Terrorists held Kenya
security forces for four days, kill-
ing at least 67 civilians and gov-
ernment troops and injuring 175
others.
The Kenyan government said
Tuesday that the attackers were
defeated, with several suspects
killed or arrested. On Wednes-
day, FBI agents began fingerprint,
DNA and ballistic analysis to
help figure out the identities and

nationalities ofthevictims and al-
Shabab gunmen.
In the aftermath of the attack,
security was tight at the Junc-
tion Mall in Nairobi. Two of three
entry gates were locked shut. Cars
were searched more carefully
than usual, with guards look-
ing in glove compartments. Two
armed soldiers were stationed
inside the mall and mall secu-
rity guards who search patrons
with metal detector wands at
entry points said the soldiers had
been deployed after the Westgate
attack.
In the U.S., the International
Council of Shopping Centers, a
trade group of shopping centers
representing about one third of
retail space globally, said the U.S.
government's Department of
Homeland Security is reaching out
to corporate security at all malls.
At the same time, the group
said some of the malls in the U.S.
and South Africa are beefing up
private security personnel, while
others are bringing in more off
dutypolice officers. Mall ofAmer-
ica, the biggest U.S. mall, added
extra uniformed security officers
and stepped up other measures,
but officials at the Blooming-
ton, Minn.-based mall declined
to elaborate. "We will ... remain
vigilant as we always do in simi-
lar situations," said Dan Jasper, a
mall spokesman.
In general, U.S. malls focus on
reacting to a shooting more than
preventing one. Malls depend on
private security personnel, most
of whom don't carry guns, though
they do work with local police.
And while they're trained to look
for suspicious behavior and report
that to authorities, they're dis-
couraged from intervening.
"Shoppers at this point perhaps
don't have an appetite for extraor-
dinary measures," said Kenneth
Hamilton, executive vice presi-
dent of IPC International, the
largest provider of shopping cen-
ter security of malls in the U.S.

Scalia expects legality of
of NSA surveillence to be
decided in U.S. courts

Justice said
suveillance best
determined by gov't
McLEAN, Va. (AP) -
Supreme Court Justice Anto-
nin Scalia said Wednesday that
the courts ultimately will have
to determine the legality of
surveillance programs by the
National Security Agency.
And he's not sure that's a
good thing in an era of complex
security threats against the
United States.
Scalia told the Northern
Virginia Technology Council
that questions about how much
information the NSA can col-
lect about Americans' telephone
calls and under what circum-
stances the agency can monitor
conversations are best answered
by the elected branches of gov-
ernment.
But he said that the Supreme
Court took that power for itself
in 1960s-era expansions of pri-
vacy rights, including prohibi-
tions on wiretapping without a
judge's approval.
"The consequence of that is
that whether the NSA can do
the stuff it's been doing ... which
used to be a question for the
people ... will now be resolved by
the branch of government that
knows the least about the issues
in question, the branch that
knows the least about the extent
of the threat against which the
wiretapping is directed," he said.
Scalia did not raise the
issue in his speech, but instead
responded to a question about
it. He repeatedly used the term
"wiretap" in his comments,
but indicated later that he was
speaking more generally about
NSA surveillance, including the
massive collection of Ameri-
cans' phone records.
In July, following the disclo-
sures by NSA leaker Edward
Snowden about the extent of the
agency's surveillance programs,
the Electronic Privacy Informa-

tion Center asked the Supreme
Court directly to bar NSA from
collecting phone call records
on millions of U.S. customers.
The court has not yet decided
whether to hear the case.
Civil liberties groups also
have filed lawsuits challenging
the program as a violation of
Americans' privacy.
Earlier this year, the Court
ruled in a 5-4 vote that clients
represented by the American
Civil Liberties Union lacked
standing to challenge a 2008 law
under which the NSA conducts
aspects of its surveillance. Scalia
voted with the majority to turn
away that challenge to the law.
Scalia said the Constitu-
tion calls for a balancing test to
determine whether any search
or seizure is reasonable, and
that depends on the threat that
is posed - another question he
said courts are ill-equipped to
answer.
He talked about the pat-
downs and other searches that
occur at airports as an example
of that balancing act.
"That's a terrible intrusion
of privacy," he said. "But you're
willing to do it because of the
seriousness of the threat."
Among the issues in the chal-
lenges to the collection of phone
records is that the court ruled EV
in 1979 that police ordinarily do A
not need a judge-approved war- A
rant to get information about
who someone has called, as
opposed to monitoring the call
itself.
As for the question about
tech companies' obligations to
inform clients about an illegal 8fl1 iTVII 5
intrusion of their information,
Scalia said that, yes, a company titiiOtiErDONnr
should speak up if it knows a tU1II NLtNIL IQ
customer has had its data ille-
gally seized. "But it's pretty
hard to know that.... If it's a gov-
ernmental wiretap, presumably
it's been approved by somebody, H R°
some lawyer expert in the field
who said it was OK, and you bet-
ter be damn sure you're right m s1
before you blow the cover." 1

Divest Ann Arbor
Reducing investments in fossil fuels should be University, city priority
Ann Arbor is now considering reducing its investments from fossil-
fuel holdings at the urging of the city's Energy Commission. Specifi-
cally, the Energy Commission is suggesting that the city's pension
fund divest its financial assets from fossil-fuel industries. Divesting from fos-
sil fuels would further Ann Arbor's environmental objective - reducing its
carbon footprint. Although the pension fund needs to be a risk-averse invest-
ment to protect its beneficiaries, Ann Arbor can pursue existing and innova-
tive strategies of making investments that protect public employees' pensions
and avoid fossil fuels.

t's hard to fully comprehend
the challenges facing Detroit
as it begins the process of rec-
reating the city
post-bankrupt-
cy. Tough deci-
sions and cuts
will be made,
but for Detroit to
retain its iden-
tity, the gems
and icons of the TIMOTHY
city must act as BURROUGHS
a foundation for
the rebuilding
process.
One of these pillars is the Detroit
Institute of Arts. The DIA, like too
many public institutions, has a his-
tory of financial struggles. However,
it was given new life with the passing
of a tax increase in 2012 to help cover
operation costs. Less than a year
later, the DIA is now being forced
to combat rumors surrounding the
potential sale of part of the museum's
collection in order to cover some of
the city's $18-million debt.
The DIA was allowed only a
few months to relax following
the passage of the tax millage last
August. The millage stabilized the
DIA's finances for the first time in
years by raising the property tax
for Macomb, Oakland and Wayne
counties, whose residents now have
free admission to the museum.
Though the campaign for the new
tax encountered stark opposition
and continues to face criticism, the
museum is now able to function
without the aid of state funding.
The DIA has in place a long-term
plan to remain a Detroit icon and
tourist attraction.

Despite being independent of the Energy
Commission, the Ann Arbor City Council is
seriously considering passing the suggested
resolution to divest its pension fund from
nonrenewable energy. Via its Climate Action
Plan, the council has made it dlear that reduc-
ing the city's carbon footprint is a priority.
This plan commits Ann Arbor to the goal of
reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 90
percent by the year 2050. Yet, the council is
conflicted when it comes to risking its pen-
sion fund. "I really want to be able to vote
for this, but I'm really, really struggling with
our responsibility to our city taxpayers,"
said Councilmember Stephen Kunselman.
It has been suggested that instead of divest-
ing from fossil fuels, the city should invest in
green energy.
The Energy Commission's initiative in sug-
gesting this resolution is an admirable exam-
ple that should be followed by other cities and
institutions. By reducing its financial engage-
mentfromthese energycompanies, AnnArbor
will join other institutions and municipalities
in advocating the transition to 'green' energy.
The city council's decision here will reveal its
commitment to its own mandate set in the Cli-
mate Action Plan.
While implementing an environmentally

conscious plan, it's possible for the city to
maintain the reliability of its pension fund.
As the University's endowment invest shows,
fossil-fuel companies tend to be very safe
investments. But Nancy Walker, the execu-
tive director of the city's retirement system,
has said that there are other financial portfo-
lios that provide equally safe returns without
resorting to coal and oil companies. In doing
this, the pension fund needs to take care in
verifying that the investments made are low
risk so as not to jeopardize employee pensions.
It's estimated that the University has more
than $900 million invested in the fossil fuel
industry, though specific data on the Univer-
sity's investments are not available to the pub-
lic. The Divest and Invest campaign, a group
of students, faculty and community members,
has called on University administration to
be transparent with its endowment invest-
ments - with the ultimate goal of divesting
from nonrenewable energy industries. With
the influx of donations coming to the Univer-
sity, administration should take the opportu-
nity to examine its existing investments and
withdraw from those that don't align with its
mission. The University should follow Ann
Arbor's example and consider responsible
divestments from fossil fuel industries.

very real pos-
sibility that a sale would ruin the
credibility of the DIA as a public
institution and betray the people
of Detroit's trust.
Beal's concerns are not unwar-
ranted. Though the museum holds
the collection in public trust, a 1919
agreement shows that the museum,
which opened as a private institu-
tion, gave up ownership of its collec-
tion to the city in exchange for a new
building owned and operated with
city funding. In recent years, state
funding has completely disappeared
while city funding has dropped to
less than 1 percent of the DIA's total
$25.4-million budget.

financial issues.
The DIA has already demon-
strated the importance of its role in
the community and taxpayers have
responded by pledging their long-
term support. Instead of attempt-
ing to undermine this progress, Orr
should be supportingthe budgetcuts,
frugal spending and public support
that have strengthened the DIA's
finances. By preserving an icon such
as the DIA through local, sustainable
support, Detroit can retain its identi-
ty and significance as it rebuilds from
its financial struggles.

DAVE WYMANI
A students' president

In July, the University placed the Presiden-
tial Search Advisory Committee in charge
of finding University President Mary Sue
Coleman's replacement. Unlike the commit-
tee that nominated Coleman in 2002, which
included two students, University staff and
non-tenured faculty, this committee includes
just administrators and tenured faculty.
While the administration is quick to assure
students - and everyone else who has been
excluded from the real selection process - of
how much they value our input, their words
ring hollow when confronted with the fact
that 24 of the top 25 universities included
students on their most recent search com-
mittees. While we applaud the efforts of the
Central Student Government to increase the
students' voice in this decision, the student
committee that they've been granted doesn't
have the power that the committee itself has.
It's no substitute for direct representation.
Everyone but the regents seems to under-
stand this.
If we are truly the Leaders and Best, why
can't we be trusted to be a part of the actual
decision, when we hold such a high stake in it?
Why have our opinions been relegated to a few
forums and easily discountable online surveys?
The strength of our University commu-
nity is in its diversity. As undergraduate and
graduate students, tenured and non-tenured
instructors, staff and Ann Arbor residents,
we all have interests, hopes and concerns for
the new president and the direction of the
University in general. We're all stakeholders
in this, and deserve to have our ideas taken
as seriously as those of the narrow fraction of
the community that makes up the adminis-
tration and the committee.
Unfortunately, the search's departure from
the more inclusive practices of past searches
and peer institutions is in no way exceptional.
It's the culmination of years of administra-
tive expansion.

We find ourselves on a campus where in-
state undergraduate tuition has risen 63 per-
cent in the last decade, making the University
continually less accessible and forcing many
students to take out dauntingly large loans.
And, yet, we're surrounded with new con-
struction geared to boost rankings and draw
out-of-state students. We have less say than
ever in how the University operates. If we
want these things to change - if we want a
president who will rethink the model the
administration has imposed - we have to
take a stand for student rights.
When state funding subsidized the major-
ity of University costs, perhaps it might have
been fair for the regents to claim the broad
authority they now do over University affairs.
But when our tuition money is 62 percent of
the budget, it's unjustifiable for the admin-
istration to disenfranchise students in this
fashion. Meanwhile, tuition climbs every
year with the rationalization of state defund-
ing, construction continues at a fever pitch
and the average student graduates with
$27,000 in debt.
The time has passed for us to quietly peti-
tion the administration for a voice in the
direction of the University. The time has
passed for us to accept a powerless "assis-
tive" role in vital decisions like the presiden-
tial search. We must demand a binding voice
in the selection of Michigan's next president
and a deciding role in the way our university
is run.
The Student Union of Michigan is resolved
to bring real democracy to our campus. The
time has come for us to take charge of our
own educations. Join us at The Cube at 12
p.m., Thursday, Oct. 3, to call on the admin-
istration to include students, faculty and staff
as part of the Presidential Search Advisory
Committee and let our voice be heard.

As a Program in the Environ-
ment major living in a co-op and
interning for U-M Recycling, most
of my friends are environmental-
ists. I'm used to being surrounded
by avid recyclers - students who
take PitE classes that require them
to keep "waste journals" and stu-
dents who drink out of mason jars,
have reusable lunch boxes and don't
mind the flies that surround their
compost bins at home.
Absorbed in my haven of sus-
tainability-minded peers, it's easy
to forget that my small community
doesn't quite represent the Univer-
sity as a whole. So in a way, it was a
nice wakeup call when last week I
saw a student at North Quad Resi-
dence Hall stuff a giant cardboard
box into a trash bin when there was
a recycling bin right next to him. I
felt like I was witnessing a crime,
but he clearly didn't think twice.
No one likes the preachy envi-
ronmentalist, so I wasn't about to
say anything, but instead I'll say it
here: University students - envi-
ronmentalists or not - need to care
more about recycling.
Reasons to recycle go way beyond
saving the trees. Recycling reduces
water use, saves energy and low-
ers the carbon emissions produced
by many industrial processes. For
example, recycling an aluminum
can save 95 percent of the energy to
make a new one, and the recycled
aluminum will be back on the shelf
in as little as 60 days.
Michigan was recently ranked
the 24th "greenest" state with an
overall recycling rate of 20 percent.
Other states, including California,
Iowa and Arkansas have recycling
rates ranging from 40 to 68 percent.

Recyclingshows Michigan pride by
helpingus lower our environmental
impact and improve our reputation
for sustainability.
Similarly, recyclingcan be agreat
way to feel proud of the University.
Each year, the University partici-
pates in RecycleMania, a recycling
competition against more than
300 other colleges and universities
nationwide. In 2013, the University
ranked 111th out of 273 schools with
a 31-percent recycling rate. Com-
pared to the top 30 schools, all of
whom hadbetween 50- and 86-per-
cent recycling rates, the University
has some serious work to do. Recy-
cling rates at Michigan Stadium
also show room for improvement.
At our first two home games this
season, recycling rates were 25 per-
cent and 21 percent.
Now compare that to Ohio State
University, where last year, the
zero-waste Ohio Stadium had a
waste-diversion rate of 98.2 per-
cent. By recycling more intelligent-
ly, students are helping to improve
our reputation as a sustainable
campus and recreate our image as
leaders in sustainability.
U-M Recycling, part of the Uni-
versity's Plan and Operations,
works hard to make it easy and
convenient for students to recycle
- there are bins in every building
and even on the Diag - but students
still need to take some initiative.
A study by the University's waste
service provider showed that at
least 15 percent of campus trash
could've been recycled.
Here in Ann Arbor, we're privi-
leged to have an easy-to-use,
single-stream recycling system
where all your paper, plastic, glass

and aluminum recyclables can be
thrown in the same bin.
The UM Waste Reduction and
Recycling Office recognizes that
each year new students, faculty and
staff join our community coming
from all different parts of the coun-
try and world - many of which do
not have such accessible recycling
systems. For people who are just
starting to recycle, it can seem like a
big responsibility.
That's why we've launched our
new publicity campaign, featuring
the University's recycling mascot,
Rufus, which is a big blue triangle
with sunglasses and a baseball cap.
Theslogan"Rufus is watching"sends
the message that students should
set a good example by choosing to
recycle because someone is always
watching. The banners are meant
to remind students that recycling is
part of being a responsible member
of the University community.
This fall, U-M Recycling will
be actively promoting recycling
and waste reduction on campus.
During the month of October, the
NoThrowber Challenge will pro-
vide students, faculty and staff
with opportunities to win prizes
by participating in waste reduc-
tion challenges. The University will
also once again participate in the
10-week RecycleMania competi-
tion, which will hopefully improve
our ranking to be amongst the top
100 schools. We hope students will
be conscious of their recycling
practices and how they contribute
to our University's reputation.
Remember: Rufus is watching,
and so is the world.

Treatment of Roma migrants
draws scrutiny from EU

More than 10,000
gypsies evicted
from squatter
camps in France
PARIS (AP) - France's
treatment of thousands of
Roma migrants who have been
expelled to Eastern Europe
came under new scrutiny
Wednesday from the Europe-
an Commission and a leading
rights group, after France's
top security official said the
migrants had a "duty to return
to their homeland."
Amnesty International said
more than 10,000 Roma, also
known as Gypsies, had been
evicted from French squatter
camps from January through
August, with many forced to
return home to Romania and
Bulgaria, despite European
Union rules requiring free
movement for all EU citizens.
Many Roma in France live
in makeshift camps set up on
vacant lots, lacking running
water or electricity. Without
regular documentation of their
residence, they have a hard time
enrolling children into school,
applying for subsidized hous-
ing, getting health care through
the national system or finding
permanent work.
Amnesty said those prob-
lems are compounded with each
forced evacuation, pushing the
Roma further out to society's
margins. In releasing its tally
of evictions - including one as
recent as Sept. 18 - Amnesty
brought together a doctor and a
teacher who had both cared for
Roma from families they said
wanted to join French society,
contrary to the image of Roma
as resistant to integration.
"What we see on the ground
is a break with the stereotypes
of social and sanitary problems,
and other cliches that are being

invoked now," said Jean-Fran-
cois Corty, a doctor with Mede-
cins du Monde. "Most of the
people we see want to integrate,
want work, want their children
in schools and want the benefits
of modern medicine."
Roma started arriving in
Europe from India in the 14th
century and there are an esti-
mated 8 million in Europe, with
the largest population in Roma-
nia. Facing discrimination and
bleak prospects in Romania,
many head west to France and
other richer European coun-
tries.
There are an estimated
20,000 Roma in France, a popu-
lation that has remained sta-
ble over several years despite
repeated attempts by both
Socialist and conservative gov-
ernments to persuade them -
sometimes forcibly - to return
home.
ManyFrenchblamethe Roma
for a rise in petty crime and an
influx of street beggars, espe-
cially in tourist areas of Paris,
where crime rings involving
children have been broken up,
and where subway announce-
ments warn every few minutes
against pickpockets.
In Sweden, police this week
acknowledged compiling a
secret, illegal registry of more
than 4,000 Roma, including
children, coming under criti-
cism from politicians who said
it was unconstitutional to regis-
ter people by ethnicity.
French Interior Minister
Manuel Valls provoked anger
Tuesday for saying the Roma
migrants had a "duty to return to
their homeland" - and despite
a wave of criticism, refused to
back down Wednesday.
Valls said the Roma had failed
to integrate and that France had
no responsibility to them.
"We don't have the obligation
to welcome these populations,
we need to say it clearly and
calmly. It is not about stigmatiz-

ing a population, but facing the
truth," he said.
John Dalhuisen, Amnesty's
Europe and Central Asia pro-
gram director, offered a differ-
ent interpretation.
"The Roma have a duty to
live in misery. That's how the
comments of the interior min-
ister should be translated," Dal-
huisen said.
In Romania, Marian Man-
dache, director of rights group
the Romani Criss, called the
French minister's comments a
"populist ruse."
"The French minister is dis-
criminating against an ethnic
group, it is a breach of the right
to free circulation and a breach
of other human rights," she told
The Associated Press.
The EU justice chief, Viviane
Reding, shot back Wednesday at
the French government, accus-
ing it of holding Romania and
Bulgaria hostage to domestic
French politics. Immigration
is a sensitive issue amid cam-
paigning for upcoming munici-
pal elections across France.
Reding accused the French
government of using tensions
over the Roma to distract vot-
ers from more serious economic
problems.
"There's an election in the
air in France," Reding said
on France-Info radio. "Every
time they don't want to talk
about important things like the
budget or debts, they find the
Roma."
In a rare statement comment-
ing on both news reports and
Reding's remarks, the French
Interior Ministry said Valls
"attentively ensures respect of
national and European rules."
The minister also noted that
"the Romanian government has
several times reiterated that the
responsibility for integrating
Roma of Romanian national-
ity was first of all the business
of Romanian authorities," the
statement said.

Pakistani villagers transport the dead body of a person killed by an earthquake for burial in the remote district of Awaran,
Baluchistan province. Rescuers struggled Wednesday to help thousands of people injured and left homeless after their
houses collapsed in a massive earthquake in southwestern Pakistan, as the death toll rose to hundreds.
Earthquake survivors fight to
find shelter, food among rubble

Pakistani quake
destroys 300 homes,
injures 373 people
DALBADI, Pakistan (AP) -
Survivors built makeshift shel-
ters with sticks and bed sheets
Wednesday, a day after their
mud houses were flattened in an
earthquake that killed 285 peo-
ple in southwestern Pakistan
and pushed a new island up out
of the Arabian Sea.
While waiting for help to
reach remote villages, hungry
people dug through the rubble
to find food. And the country's
poorest province struggled with
a dearth of medical supplies,
hospitals and other aid.
The quake flattened wide
swathes of Awaran district,
where it was centered, leaving
much of the population home-
less.
Almost all of the 300 mud-
brick homes in the village of
Dalbadi were destroyed. Noor
Ahmad said he was working
when the quake struck and
rushed home to find his house
leveled and his wife and son
dead.
"I'm broken," he said. "I have
lost my family."
At least 373 people were also
injured, according to a state-
ment from the National Disaster
Management Authority, which
gave the latest death toll.
Doctors in the village treated
some of the injured, but due to
a scarcity of medicine and staff,
they were mostly seen comfort-
ing residents.
The remoteness of the area
and the lack of infrastructure
hampered relief efforts. Awaran
district is one of the poorest in
the country's most impover-
ished province.
Just getting to victims was
challenging in a region with
almost no roads where many
people use four-wheel-drive
vehicles and camels to traverse
the rough terrain.
"We need more tents. more

medicine and more food," said
a spokesman for the provincial
government, Jan Mohammad
Bulaidi.
Associated Press images from
the village of Kaich showed
the devastation. Houses made
mostly of mud and handmade
bricks had collapsed. Walls and
roofs caved in, and people's pos-
sessions were scattered on the
ground. A few goats roamed
through the ruins.
The Pakistani military said it
had rushed almost 1,000 troops
to the area overnight and was
sending helicopters as well. A
convoy of 60 Pakistani army
trucks left the port city of Kara-
chi early Wednesday with sup-
plies.
Pakistani forces have evacu-
ated more than 170 people from
various villages around Awaran
to the district hospital, the mili-
tary said. Others were evacu-
ated to Karachi.
One survivor interviewed in
his Karachi hospital bed said
he was sleeping when the quake
struck.
"I don't know who brought
me from Awaran to here in
Karachi, butI feel back pain and
severe pain in my-whole body,"
he said.
Jan said he didn't know what
happened to the man's family.
He was trying to contact rela-
tives.
Local officials said they
were sending doctors, food and
1,000 tents for people who had
nowhere to sleep. The efforts
were complicated by strong
aftershocks.
Baluchistan is Pakistan's
largest province but also the
least populated. Medical facili-
ties are few and often poorly
stocked with supplies and quali-
fied personnel. Awaran district
has about 300,000 residents
spread out over 29,000 square
kilometers (11,197 square miles).
The local economy consists
mostly of smuggling fuel from
Iran or harvesting dates.
The area where the quake
ctriir'is t tbar' an-- f- an'--

insurgency that Baluch separat-
ists have been waging against
the Pakistani government for
years. The separatists regular-
ly attack Pakistani troops and
symbols of the state, such as
infrastructure projects.
It's also prone to earth-
quakes. A magnitude 7.8 quake
centered just across the border
in Iran killed at least 35 people
in Pakistan last April.
Tuesday's shaking was so
violent it drove up mud and
earth from the sea floor to cre-
ate a new island off the Paki-
stani coast.
A Pakistani Navy team
reached the island by mid-
day Wednesday. Navy geolo-
gist Mohammed Danish told
the country's Geo Television
that the mass was a little wider
than a tennis court and slightly
shorter than a football field.
The director of the Nation-
al Seismic Monitoring Cen-
ter confirmed that the mass
was created by the quake and
said scientists were trying to
determine how it happened.
Zahid Rafi said such masses
are sometimes created by the
movement of gases locked in
the earth that push mud up to
the surface.
"That big shock beneath the
earth causes a lot of distur-
bance," he said.
He said these types of islands
can remain for a long time or
eventually subside back into
the ocean, depending on their
makeup.
He warned residents not to
visit the island because it was
emitting dangerous gases.
But dozens of people went
anyway, including the deputy
commissioner of Gwadar dis-
trict, Tufail Baloch.
Water bubbled along the
edges of the island. The land
was stable but the air smelled of
gas that caught fire when peo-
ple lit cigarettes, Baloch said.
Dead fish floated on the
water's surface while local resi-
dents visited the island and took

Clashes break out at Athens
anti-fascist demonstration

Conflict arises a
week after fatal
stabbing
ATHENS, Greece (AP) -
Clashes broke out during an
anti-fascist demonstration in
Athens on Wednesday, a week
after a fatal stabbing allegedly
committed by a supporter of
the extreme right-wing Golden
Dawn party led to a nationwide
crackdown against the group.
About 30 protesters threw
firebombs, rocks and bottles at
riot police blocking the main
avenue in front of Golden Dawn
* headquarters as a demonstra-
tion of several thousand peo-
ple headed toward it. Police
responded with volleys of tear
gas and stun grenades.
The killing of anti-fascist rap
singer Pavlos Fyssas on Sept. 18
sparked outrage across Greece
and has led to scrutiny of the
party's activities. The suspect
arrested over his death admit-
ted to police that he had stabbed
the 34-year-old and identified
himself as a member of Golden
Dawn, a virulently anti-immi-
grant party that has seen a
massive rise in popularity amid
Greece's severe financial crisis.
The party has vehemently
denied any role in the kill-
ing. Although the suspect has
not been officially identified
in accordance with Greek law,
he has been widely named by
Greek media, which has also
published photos of him at
Golden Dawn events.
"Pavlos is alive, crush the
Nazis," the protesters chanted
as they set off from the capital's
main Syntagma Square, where
an earlier anti-fascist concert
had been held. In Thessaloniki,
Greece's No. 2 city, about 2,000
protesters also heading to local
Golden Dawn offices. Greek
media said other rallies were also
planned in several other cities.
The government ordered
an investigation into Golden
Dawn's activities after Fyssas'
death, with the case being han-

died by Greece's Supreme Court
and anti-terrorist squad under
organized crime laws.
Separately, Health Min-
ister Adonis Georgiadis said
Wednesday that authorities
were also investigating reports
that a psychiatrist at Athens'
main state psychiatric hospital
had been granting certificates
for gun licenses to Golden Dawn
members without conducting
the required tests, and that the
psychiatrist had been calling
for the military to take up arms
against the government.
The crackdown against Gold-
en Dawn has included raids on
narty offices and supnorters

suspected of being involved in
attacks.
Police said Wednesday they
arrested a 34-year-old in Crete
after a raid on his house uncov-
ered a replica gun, a military-
style knife and a collapsible
metal baton. Golden Dawn
membership cards and other
paraphernalia with the party
logo were also found.
Golden Dawn, whose senior
members have expressed admi-
ration for Adolf Hitler although
they deny being neo-Nazi, won
nearly 7 percent in 2012 general
elections and holds 18 seats in
the country's 300-member Par-

personalized ad campaigns run
by companies like Amazon and
Google.
Murphy said she was shocked
to hear she had been nominated.
She envisioned chemists and biol-
ogists winning the fellowship -
not statisticians.
"I didn't even aspire to ever
winning a MacArthur Founda-
tion (Fellowship)," she said. "It
just completely floored me."
Murphy plans to use her sti-
pend to further her treatment
research. She said her team is
currently working on a mobile
application that would provide
personalized recommenda-
tions and coaching to individu-
als in real time, depending on
the situation they find them-
selves in.
Murphy said she is thankful
that, as a statistician, she is able
to use mathematics and quantita-
tive methods to improve people's
lives.
"I really like math, and I like
the sense that I can do things

users is not an easy task.
"The Wi-Fi problems aren't
really gone, in the sense that
there's still conflict with devic-
es around campus," Palms
said. "We have about 170 Wi-Fi
access points in (Mary Markley
Residence Hall), but at the same
time, students have brought in
around 60 access points, and
that causes us a problem because
there's this conflict in use of the
spectrum."
Engineering Prof. Mingyan
Liu compared the wireless sig-
nal spectrum to a busy confer-
ence room, where the users are a
group of people who need to talk
to each other in that room.
"The more people you pack in
that room, the lower the quality
of the conversations, for obvious
reasons," Liu said. "The capacity
is limited by interference. You
can only fit so many people in
the room; eventually, you have to
find another one."
LSA freshman Kelly Lewis is
one of the many students who
use their own wireless network
as opposed to the University's.
University Housing prohibits
students from creating their own

that help people using the
skills that I can bring to the
table," she said. "It would be
great to see more people doing
that."
Cecilia Conrad, vice presi-
dent of the MacArthur Fellows
Program, wrote on the founda-
tion's website that this year's
24 winners are "an extraordi-
nary group of individuals who
collectively reflect the breadth
and depth of American creativ-
ity."
Murphy is the 25th Univer-
sity faculty member to receive
the fellowship. In 2011, three
faculty members from the Uni-
versity received the fellowship,
including Tiya Miles, chair of the
Department of Afroamerican &
African Studies; Chemistry Prof.
Melanie Sanford; and Yukiko
Yamashita, an assistant profes-
sor of cell and developmental
biology.
"It is always an honor when
U-M faculty members are recog-
nized with such distinguished
recognition for their work," Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald wrote in an e-mail.
wireless networks from within
the dorms.
Nonetheless, Lewis said she
prefers to do her homework in
her dorm room, which she says
has "better Internet."
At this point, however, Palms
said its clear the issue has been
alleviated, evidenced by the net-
work's performance during the
launch of Apple's latest operating
system, iOS 7, last week. He said
MWireless saw a nearly 25-per-
cent increase in use the day iOS
7 came out, but the University
didn't see any network problems
arise as a result.
"It's really our strong intent
to actually meet this demand,
because it's clearly something
that people want to have and
need to have," Palms said. "We
continue to work to provide the
service that folks want to have."
To figure out a better way to
meet users' needs, the University
is currently considering a differ-
ent model for Wi-Fi funding. As
of now, individual buildings and
dorms spend their own money to
set up wireless modems.
"(The goal for the future) is a
different model for funding so
that ITS can provide a consis-
tent service across campus so
students can walk into virtually
any space and get a similar ser-

"But for the new students, this
is the way it will be and they will
create their own memories. It is
still East Quad, and now with the
students here, they will make it
funky - the way it was before."
East Quad now houses 856
students in 329 double rooms and
192 single rooms, and is home to
the Residential College and the
Michigan Community Scholar
Program, a residential learning
community focused on service
and social justice.
Coleman said in her remarks
that she was proud of the way in
which the renovated residence
hall would help to "strengthen

affiliated with Greek Life, said
he hopes to see more houses
involved in each division.
The winning houses will be
determined based on the great-
est volume of recyclables in
comparison to the volume of gar-
bage. Every participating house
will be given recycling bins from
Recycle Ann Arbor. The local
non-profit will also offer recy-
cling education to members of
the Greek community.
In order to participate, each
house must appoint a sustain-
ability chair - someone who has
interest in the project's goals to

ing."
"Michigan has traditionally
been at the cutting edge of meld-
ing the living and learning envi-
ronment," Coleman said in an
interview after her address. "The
RC started way before this was
very popular across the coun-
try and a lot of colleges are now
offering these kinds of experi-
ences."
Coleman added that this
factor helped the University
remain competitive with other
institutions' on-campus hous-
ing options and that a continual
process of improvement would
always be needed.
"There is nothing more impor-
tant to me - nothing more
important than making sure the
experiences studentsgetatMich-
igan are unique and academically
focused, and make people better
I think that's going to be a really
exciting opportunity."
In an August interview in
Mumbai, University alum Bharat
Govinda, secretary of UMIAA,
said Coleman's visit will be
highly symbolic for the Univer-
sity's extensive alumni network
in India. According to UMIAA's
Facebook page, the group claims
1,400 active members - though
there are countless more that live
and work in India.
"There's a sense of camara-
derie," Govinda said of alumni
connections. "If me or my friends
bump into someone and realize
there's some kind of Michigan
connection, there's immediately
a whole different connection."
Govinda added that UMIAA
is looking forward to an update
from Coleman on current affairs

well as recycling.
Houses will permit weekly
bin and dumpster inspections
by GLIST, and a GLIST member
must speak at a chapter meeting
before the house can compete.
This is the first year Greek
Life has teamed up with Recy-
cleMania. Last year, GLIST held
a recycling event that reward-
ed Greek houses with food in
return for involvement. Trust
for Cups provided fraternities
with discounted plastic cups if
35 percent of their waste was
recycled.
Kononenko said he organized
the competition to go in a differ-
ent direction for 2013.
"I wanted to be able to work
with people that have similar
interests and people who would
respect my voice and they would
enjoy working with another stu-
dent as opposed to working with

human beings, and that is what
we are all about," Coleman said.
Harper touched upon similar
themes of melding the living and
learningexperience.
"What we have accomplished
in the renovation of East Quad is
a renewal of the constant hope of
lifelong living and learning expe-
riences that come out of lasting
friendships and prepare our stu-
dents to be contributing students
of the world," Harper said.
LSA senior Jihad Komis, a stu-
dent in the Residential College,
spent two years living in East
Quad prior to the renovation and
is now a resident of the renovated
building.
"They tried to preserve a lot of
the great things that made East
Quad unique, but at the same
time they really expanded the
opportunities for students to
at the University and in Ann
Arbor.
Before attending the business
conference in Mumbai, Coleman
will visit the National Council
of Applied Economic Research,
a social science institute; the All
India Institute of Medical Sci-
ences,whichhas worked with the
University of Michigan Health
System since 2010. She will also
give a keynote speech on the
strengths of large, world-class
universities at the Federation of
Indian Chambers of Commerce
and Industry in New Delhi.
Coleman will also visit Delhi
University and the newly estab-
lished Ashoka University to
improve study-abroad connec-
tions for students.
Holloway, who will be accom-
panyingColeman onher trip, said
faculty or staff," he said. "I saw
this as an opportunity to create
change within my own demo-
graphic."
For the past three years,
GLIST has had three pilot pro-
grams across campus. Leaders
from the University's chapters
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta
Upsilon and Sigma Phi Epsilon
joined together in the recycling
initiative with events aimed at
spreading awareness.
LSA junior Mara Geller,
GLIST's vice president of opera-
tions and member of Sigma
Kappa, said she hopes this pro-
gram will show the University
what Greek life is really about.
"In recent months, the Uni-
versity has had a negative per-
spective on Greek life, and,
through such events, we hope to
bring a more positive light to the
community," Geller said.
LSA junior Jordan Kamphuis,

explore here," Komis said.
After the completion of West
Quad in 2015, the University's
Board of Regents may consider
further renovations to other resi-
dence halls, including Bursley
Residence Hall on North Cam-
pus, but no plans are currently in
the works.
Loren Rullman, associate
vice president of student affairs,
said this is the start of a broader
look at buildings across campus,
including the campus recreation-
al spaces like the CentralCampus
Recreational Building.
"We are actually tryingtotake a
comprehensive look at allthe spac-
es students use and (we are) trying
to improve them. It is notjust resi-
dence halls," Rullman said. "We
are trying to make this commit-
ment to students and student life
in amore comprehensive way."
faculty from the Survey Research
Center, LSA and the Medical
school will travel to India to
assist Coleman in her outreach.
Dean of Engineering David Mun-
son and Dean of Business Alison
Davis-Blake will join the group
when they travel to Mumbai for
the business conference.
Holloway added that the indi-
viduals accompanying Coleman
were invited to help develop last-
ing partnerships and collabora-
tive projects to ensure that they
are "sufficient value" to the trip.
The respective attendees'
departments will fund the trip
and the Office of the President
will cover Coleman's expenses.

the program was a great way to
get people from his fraternity
involved with recycling.
"This program has not only
informed my fraternity and oth-

how easy it is," Kamphuis said.
"Because of this, whether people

Feds accuse man of
lying on citizenship
application about
village massacre
RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) - A
former Guatemalan soldier tolda
jury Wednesday that he was sob-
bing as he took a 3-year-old boy
to be killed - but an officer said
he was doing"a job for a man."
Three decades later, that offi-
cer, Jorge Sosa, is battling to
remain a U.S. citizen.
Sosa, a small, mustachioed
man, listened calmly and took
notes as an interpreter relayed
details of the 1982 slaughter in
the hamlet of Dos Erres.
Sosa, who was a second lieu-
tenant during Guatemala's civil
war, is charged with lying on
his U.S. citizenship application
about his military service and
his command role in the massa-
cre of at least 160 men, women
and children in the village.
If convicted, he could face up
to 15 years in prison and lose his
citizenship.
But defense attorney Shashi
Kewalramani said Sosa told
U.S. officials about his role in
the Guatemalan army when he
applied for asylum, years before
becoming a citizen..
While war is horrible, Sosa
is only being tried for the way

he answered questions on his
immigration forms, Kewalra-
mani has said.
While Sosa is not on trial for
war crimes, the government's
case is bringing graphic and
painful memories of Guatema-
la's war to a California court-
room.
Prosecutors say Sosa's patrol
descended upon Dos Erres in
December 1982 to search for
missing rifles believed stolen
by guerrillas, then decided to
kill the villagers after some of
the soldiers began raping the
women.
Speaking in Spanish through
an interpreter, Gilberto Jordan,
a former sergeant, testified that
the soldiers began throwing
people into a well and that Sosa
fired his rifle at the people inside
and threw in agrenade.
"The people that were there,
half-dead, were all screaming,"
Jordan said. "When he threw
the grenade the people that were
there were quiet because they
were killed."
Sosa sought U.S. asylum in
1985, claiming that Guatemalan
guerrillas were after him. The
asylum was denied and he ended
up moving to Canada. He later
returned to the U.S, married an
American, got a green card and
eventually citizenship after fil-
ing an application in 2007.
After authorities searched
his Southern California home

in 2010, Sosa headed to Mexico
and boarded a flight to Canada,
where he also is a citizen. He was
later arrested and was extradit-
ed lastyear to the United States.
Jordan is serving time in fed-
eral prison for lying on his U.S.
naturalization application about
his role in the war.
Wearing orange jail garb,
Jordan testified that he took a
woman to the well and shot her
in the back of the head before
pushing her inside, and started
takinga teenage girl to be killed
when another soldier stopped
him and asked if he was going to
rape her.
When he answered no, the
soldier took the girl away and
later brought her back, bleeding,
to the well, Jordan said.
Another former Guatemalan
soldier, Cesar Franco Ibanez,
testified in Spanish through a
translator that he was called to a
meeting at the village well, and
saw it was half full of men, some
of them yelling at Sosa.
"They were cursing him,"
Franco Ibanez told the court. "At
that time, I think he lost his head
and he started firing."
Soldiers were then ordered to
bring more people to the well.
Everyone had to throw some-
body in to show they were com-
mitted to the patrol, he said.
The women had already been
lined up. Franco Ibanez said he
took a woman and threw her in.

Former greats win tournament

PATRICK BARRON/Da
Redshirt sophomore guard Graham Glasgow could be switching over to center during the bye week.
Change at center
not ruled out yet

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
It was tough to foresee that,
when Michigan men's tennis
coach Bruce Berque was mix-
ing and matching doubles pairs
in 2009, he would create a team
strong enough to win at the pro-
fessional level just a few years
later.
During the season, then-
Michigan stars Evan King and
Jason Jung were the Wolver-
ines' best players. However,
many coaches are hesitant to put
the team's top players together
because they have to field three
teams. But King and Jung were
an exception and ever since pair-
ing up, they haven't skipped a
beat at the futures level - one
level below the ATP Tour. The
duo recently won the ITF Pro
Circuit Tevlin Futures Tourna-
ment in Toronto.
"Sometimes you just have to
try out a pair and see if it works,"
Berque said. "And this one did."
Despite graduating just a
few months ago, King made it a
point to pair up with his former
partner after leaving Ann Arbor.
And once the former Wolverine
greats came back as one, it was
like they never stopped playing
together. It's safe to say King and
Jung have formed a chemistry
better than many pairs at the
Futures level.
During the tournament, they
defeated the No.1 and No. 2 seeds
en route to their title. King and
Jung defeated the first-ranked
pair of Milan Pokrajac and Peter
Polansky, 7-5, 6-2, in the final.
King stressed that beating
Polansky was a big confidence
boost. Polansky is ranked in the
top 250 and went on to win the
singles draw of the same tourna-
ment.
King and Jung both played in
high-pressure matches at Michi-
gan, which is proving beneficial
already - especially for inexpe-
rienep-rofessionals.

State College John Arena
on Saturday. TV/Radio:
The 2012 BTN
season will be
remembered
for a seven-game winning streak
that brought Michigan past No. 2
Stanford in the Elite Eight and to
its first-ever Final Four appear-
ance. But what Michigan coach
Mark Rosen hasn't forgotten is
the five-game Big Ten winning
streak that made it all possible.
"This team has a lot of ambi-
tion in the Big Ten," Rosen said.
"It's something that we feel
like we've lacked in the past.
We haven't played as well as we
should or would like to in the Big
Ten, and that's been a focus of
this team."
Following three lay-down
losses in late October with post-
season aspirations on the line,
the Wolverines blew past Indi-
ana before taking four straight
matches - including wins over
then-No. 4 Nebraska and No. 10
Minnesota - to start Novem-
ber. The run earned Michigan
a respectable 11-9 conference
record - tied for sixth in the Big
Ten.
In a conference that boasts
eight Top 25 teams, the challenge

this season will be as formidable
as years past. Despite general
success over the last 13 years -
including double-digit NCAA
Tournament appearances - the
Wolverines (10-1) are 135-145 all-
time in the Big Ten under Rosen.
But what Rosen does have in
2013 are bigger expectations and
a bigger team to work with. With
the addition of three tall fresh-
men - including 6-foot-5 middle
blocker Abby Cole - the roster
now boasts 11 players over 6-foot,
a potential X-factor against the
volleyball-bred Cornhuskers.
With the record books in mind
and a Final Four showing under
its belt, this team may have what
it takes to knock off opponents
like the perennial champion-
ship-contenting Nittany Lions.
"We get to start right off the
bat with two good teams," Rosen
said. "Ohio State is one of the
few undefeated teams left in the
country and so they're certainly
having a great year so that will
be a great challenge for us. What
better way to start? Let's jump
right in the deep and go."
As the only undefeated team
remaining in the Big Ten - and
one of seven left in the nation
- No. 13 Ohio State (12-0) com-
pleted its best start since 2004
following a sweep over Buffalo
last weekend. Still, Michigan
will be just the second ranked
opponent the Buckeyes have
faced this season.
As a relatively smaller team,
Ohio State features some of the
strongest defense Michigan will
see this season. Senior libero
Davionna DiSalvatore ranks
among the Top 10 in digs for the
Big Ten with 170 and an aver-
age 3.78 per set. In the team's
opening weekend, DiSalvatore
recorded her 1,000th career dig,

putting her at 11th on the Buck-
eyes' all-time record list. On
offense, Ohio State boasts two-
time Big Ten Setter of the Week
junior Taylor Sherwin.
The Wolverines' lone loss on
the season, which came against
No. 16 Florida State, could prove
a blessing rather than a curse
against the Big Ten elite.
"No one wants to lose, but
it's kind of a good thing to lose
before we get into Big Ten sea-
son, which is really important to
us," said sophomore outside hit-
ter Ally Davis. "We don't want
to lose there, but it kind of just
showed us what we need to work
on. Soit was kind of not a terrible
thing that it highlighted what we
need to get better at."
Against the taller front line of
Penn State, the Wolverines have
one thingto focus on: the block.
The Nittany Lions (9-1) feature
10 players over 6-foot, including
6-foot-6 senior middle blocker
Katie Slay and the 6-foot-5 duo
of outside hitter Aiyana Whitney
and middle blocker Erica Den-
ney. Penn State also returns the
6-foot-4 reigning Big Ten Player
of the Year in senior outside hit-
ter Ariel Scott.
The loss against Florida State
exposed a hole in the block, most
notably from the inexperienced
Cole. Against Scott, the job of
closing will fall heavily on senior
co-captain middle blocker Jen-
nifer Cross. In the Wolverine
Invitational last weekend, Cross
tallied 41 kills and 18 total blocks
- including seven against No. 24
Ohio on Saturday. Cross will be
joined by sophomore Krystaline
Goode, who leads the team with
44 blocks on the season.
With a bigger target on its
back, Michigan won't have games
to give in the month of October.

Jen Cross: Under the net, over the border

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Jennifer Cross tied her shoes,
slipped on her kneepads and
stretched her long legs out in
front of her. As she took a sip of
water and finished braiding her
hair, she looked around. The rest
of her teammates were also fin-
ishing up last-minute routines
before takingthe court.
Cross couldn't help but smile.
The Canadian national volleyball
team, made up of 30 women, was
heading to Mexico for the 2012
Pan American Games the fol-
lowing day and excitement was
high for the 12-day event. It was
the first year that Cross had been
invited to be a member of the
senior national team.
She was at the peak of her
career - having played weeks of
the best volleyball of her life -
and she was ready to showcase
her talent on the international
stage.
The 6-foot-4 middle block-
er proceeded out of the locker
room and onto the court to begin
warming up. Once the coaches
joined the team on court, the last
full practice began.
That was when it happened.,
Cross went up for the block,
like she does routinely, but this
time was different. The ball took
a surprising spin, forcing her
opponent to reach across the net
and land at a weird angle. The
other girl ended up underneath
the net on Cross'ss side. Cross
came down from her block and
landed on her opponent's foot.
Cross suffered a severe ankle
injury but, thinking it was just a
standard sprain, she decided to
accompany the team to Mexico.

trip.
"That night, I realized (the
injury) was much, much worse,
but at that point I wasn't goingto
bail on my team," Cross said. "So
I went to Mexico. But the plane
ride made the injury worse."
The change of cabin pressure
in the airplane caused the blood
to rush to her foot, intensifying
the bruising.
Without Cross, the Canadian
team finished eighth at the Pan
American Games. While her
teammates were competing,
Cross spent the 12 days in Mexico
unable to walk.
At the time, Cross wanted to
do the right thing by traveling
with her team and supporting it.
"Looking back now, I wish I
had stayed home," Cross said. "I
thought I'd be OK, but I turned
out not being OK."
During the trip, Cross had to
make a tough call to Michigan
coach Mark Rosen. Realizing the
injury had worsened, Cross knew
she had to admit to herself, and
then to Rosen, that she needed to
begin the recovery process.

White worked with her every day
and the two alternated between
compression and cold ice water
for weeks.
Once again, Cross's determi-
nation took over, and after don-
ning a walking boot for just two
weeks, Cross was finally able to
walk again without crutches and
move toward returning to the
court.
Cross roared back from her
injury.
After missing just the first
week and a half of preseason, she
was back on the court with her
teammates.
Astonishing everyone, she
found her groove quickly and
helped lead Michigan to its best
season in program history.
ALLISON FARRAND/Daily "It's very hard to get back from
that sort of injury just because
you want to be able to push your-
self in practice and get back to
playing, but if you get back to
playing too soon, you can really
hurt yourself in the long run,"
Cross said.
Still, in the first game of the
season, Cross put up seven kills
and five block assists. Not too
shabby for a player coming off an
injury with restricted practice
time.
In preseason, with Cross's
injury and teammate Claire
McElheny suffering from an
Achilles flare, the Wolverines
were thin at her position. The
team had one middle blocker to
fill three spots.
"It was then that we went to
Cross and said, 'OK we need you
to be active even though you're

"It was an improv show,"
chuckled Seth Samuels, a 2013
Ross School of Business BBA
graduate, as he glanced at his glass
filled with hot water and pulpy
lemon. "We were improvising."
On the table, a red-covered
book sprawled neatly over the
wood. Next to the book, bread
crumbs settled next to the back
of a receipt, where Samuels had
written "potential" in ballpoint
ink, the letters pressed sharply
onto the page to make indents. A
small graph adorned the paper.
Samuels ran his hand over the
book's cover.
"Storytelling is an ingrained
part of being a human being," he
said."It'sattributedtooursurvival
- relieving stress. ... At its core,
storytelling starts with someone
drawing out their own personal
experience and considering it in
a way that they hadn't previously.
And sharing that (experience)
with other people."
And so, Samuels's self-
described "improv" act led to a
video compilation, an upcoming
exhibition and arecently published
book - all aimed at "sharing
(stories) with other people."
More importantly, though, the
"improvisation" cracked open
the entrance to a new wave of
storytelling on campus, titled the
Spotlight Project.

The Spotlight Project, an
extension of TEDxUofM, began
in December 2011as a half-formed
thought in Samuels's mind after
attending and organizing one
of the University's TEDxUofM
conferences. The TEDxUofM
community itself joins the ranks
of the broader TED nonprofit
organization, a well acclaimed
program linking its three pillars
of technology, entertainment
and design into a series of annual
conferences. TED emphasizes
the power and values of ideas to
promote passionate change and
additionally offers TED Talks, a
series of lectures by prominent
thinkerswhichfurther the mission
to extend cultural, scientific and
creative spaces into the lives of
everyday people. The University's
branch of TEDx offers its own
conference yearly. According to
the TEDxUofM Facebook page,
the conference hopes to "bring
together great minds, brilliant
talent and innovative thinkers
who are eager to inform the
universe about their passions and
dreams for the future."
More thanspeakers onthe
stage
Samuels echoes TEDx as the
soundboard for his own curiosity
and rich expansion of ideas. Yet,

he noticed that the conference
was doing something peculiar:
emphasizing the stage for one
day, and inadvertently forgetting
to leave a long-lasting impact on
its audience.
"A bunch of people would
come together, have a great
one-day experience ... hearing
inspiringspeakers," Samuelssaid,
when discussing his first TEDx
Conference. "Yet we had no way
of determining if our conference
- that we put so much time into
outside of class - was having a
huge impact."
And so, the Spotlight Project
bloomed into existence.
"I became enthralled withthis
idea that maybe there's more to
TEDxUofM than speakers on
the stage," Samuels said. "Maybe
there's something in the audience
that we should focus on."
The Spotlight Project is an
effort to intentionally shift "the
spotlight" from the stage to the
audience. The project discovers
and films remarkable stories on
campus and gives those stories
back to the campus community
through a series of online videos
andexhibitions.Afterconcluding
its nearly two-year production
period in April 2013, the project
has filmed 15 spotlight videos and
compiled 27 of those additional
interviewsinto a book.

"Picture a whiteboard,"
Samuels said, as he sketched an
axis on the back of a coffee-shop
receipt. "It's a perfect bell curve."
Samuels drew a peaked curve to
represent the TEDx Conference.
"The peak is a flicker of our
human potential to consider, to
create, to interact," he said. "It's
really a special moment. But
it's unrealistic to believe that
it can live on because once the
conference ends, we go on with
initial life." Samuels paused, and
drew a downward slope tapering
off, in blackballpoint pen. "This is
daily life," he said. "I'm interested
in how we can create follow-up
peaks after that initial peak."
In a sense, Samuels focused
on increasing a similar sense of
inspiration and energy - "follow-
up peaks" - after the conference
ended, thus gradually extending
the impression and inspiration
that the annual TEDx Conference
offers.
Ashley Park, a 2013 School
of Music, Theatre & Dance
graduate, was interviewed for the
Spotlight Project. Park began the
Michigan Performance Outreach
Workshop - a program that
offers a day-long excursion of
theatre,musicandartsimmersion
workshops for youth in Detroit -
at ,the University. Her Spotlight
interview informs the audience

of her passion for
arts immersion, and
the creation of the
program.
As an
interviewee of the
Spotlight Project,
Park described
the experience
as "informative."
She noted the
helpfulness in
being able to
"articulate our
story." Park said,
"We'd just put on
our first event, and I hadn't had a
lot of time to reflect on what had
happened. Having to articulate
(our story) - why we were doing
(the program), what it was, what
it meant forus - was really kind
of moving," Park said. "I almost
started crying on camera; not
because I was really sad or
really happy or really emotional,
but because it meant a lot to tell
everything to an audience."
Park further emphasized
the Spotlight Project's ability
in allowing stories all across
campus to be amplified.
"Spotlight Project gave us an
opportunity to explain the
mission of (our program), and
why we were doing it," she said.
"Every Single person has a
story. And a lot of people don't

have someone to listen to their
stories. But a story is something
that has heart behind it - no
matter what it is. It can be
something that is ongoing, and
it is a partof humanity and life."
The Spotlight Project was
designed with the principle
of hearing - and exchanging
- such stories. 2013 TEDx
director Maria Young, an
Engineering senior, described
the beginning of the Spotlight
Project. "I absolutely love
all the TED talks," Young
said. "They're amazing, but
sometimes I wonder if they
discourage attendees because
all of our speakers have done
these huge, amazing things."

Roasting East Quad

baked.buzzed.bored.
in this new series, three daily arts writers
in varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:

'm so sick of hearing about
East Quad.
Yeah, the rooms are
much cushier now than they
were when
I stayed in
them during
orientation.
The Java ' 
Blue Caf6 is
a posh place \
to dump
my Dining
Dollars (also NATE
known as WOOD
"Monopoly
Money")
and the renovated community
spaces do have vastly improved
seating and lighting. But the
dining hall? Way overrated.
Before I start taking my
jabs, though, let me give credit
where credit is due: The team
of architects and interior
designers that drafted the
project and saw it to completion
really did exercise impressive
creativity. The whole station-
style/micro-restaurant layout
- while not as innovative as
the University bills it - is
a pretty cool way to dine; it
takes out the whole middle-
school-cafeteria vibe and
replaces it with the illusion that
you're being offered a more-
satisfying variety of options.
The integrated collection of
booths, differently sized tables,
bar stools, countertops and
more secluded areas to eat
comprisingthe dining hall's
seating is fun and modern. The
detail invested in mixing up
wall coverings is unsurpassed.
Tiles of all shapes and sizes,
slate boards, the whole palate of
neutral paints, bigger-than-life
photographs, artistic signs with
modern fonts, hard woods and
a smattering of windows are all
packed into this small space.
The lighting is dim, and the
energy is subdued.
The food, however, is nothing
to brag about.

"Face/Off"
Papa Blunt is such a G tho. I show up out of nowhere and he just hands me
this massive joint that he's been rolling for like five days. I look at it for like
five straight minutes without moving. Ijust stare. Oh, I forgot: Morgana's here
too and he's ALREADY being such a fucking downer. I look into his eyes and
I don't see that wildness that lets him land perfect no-scope LoL binds. The
little dude's so sober, he makes my stats professor look like fuckin' Bill Nye.
The little dude's so sober, he makes Mormon people look like Kanye groupies.
That's pretty sober. Anyways, Panda and Anna and Noodle are here too and
that beautiful blunt isn't goingto puff itself. It'd be pretty dOp3 if it did tho. I
take 500 divided by100 massive hits and I'm outtie. We roll on over to State to
pray to Nicolas Cage, and SURPRISE SURPRISE: Morgana ditches the fuck
out of us. So do Anna and Papa Blunt, but Scza Scza shows up out of nowhere
and we're GFFs (Greatest Friends Forever) so IDGAF.
Guys. Seriously: Why doesn't everyone watch this movie every day for a
week every year? There are all these deep themes about identity and life and
insanity. Ican't take it all at the same time so I start losing it. I don't even know
how to handle the fact that Nicolas Cage AND John Travolta are in this movie.
Oh wait, yes I do: There's no scene of them dancingtogether so that calms me
down a little bit but I'm still pretty hype. Panda jacks my entire Fireball and
PTFO (passes the fuck out). He asks me for my arm and I give in cuz we're
GFFs. I snap pics because we're GFFs. Nicolas Cage is screaming the entire
time. Why is this so funny? The movie ends and I think I've died but I'm still
alive. But is my mind?.

I'm just a meek old simple soul. All I want is a box of Cheez-Its, a sofa
and endless re-runs of "Avatar." No bullshit. Those are my ambitions.
Somehow, I've been duped. I'm staring dumb-faced at somebody else's
dumb face. He's got the look of a coffee shop hipster. He gets me my
ticket and the Fireball we took pulls from (so much shame) hits right
then. Now, I know I'm good and drunk: I give the pinch-face a tip. "You
tipped him?" Panda looks displeased. He's wearing one of those fuzzy
sweaters you throw on kids at Christmastime like a Hallmark movie. I
can't tell if he's flexing or if the sweater's two sizes too small.
"I guess so."
"Fuck that. Not about that life, man," Panda says. "I'm all about those
boats, hoes and clothes."
(If you look very closely, you'll see a drunk.)
Me, Chocolate Shayk, Panda and Noodle head inside.
We shout shit at the screen like everybody else and kick back with
our feet on the backs of the row ahead of us. Nick Cage is garbed in
priest clothes and he's grabbing butts and dancing, everybody in the
theater hooting and hollering, and I look over and Panda - Panda's
sleeping.
He's wrapped Chocolate Shayk's arm behind his head and he's
napping like a precious, goddamn child. It makes me wanna give him a
binky and buy him a cone of ice-cream when he wakes up.
Shayk leans over pointing a finger at the phone and Itake the picture.
Panda is displeased. He wakes up and mutters a threat.
"We can get you a glass of warm milk if you want."
He opens an eye. "Fuck you. Buy me Milk Duds, bitch."

I'm pretty bored. Chocolate Shayke and Scza Scza have come out
in full force and are fighting over who loves each other more. They're
GFFs (girlfriends forever) so what could you really expect. Panda and
Papa Blunt are discussing the pros and cons of their khaki pants while
Morgana and I are shivering from the cold. Noodle is carrying the
fifth of fireball in the open. On State St. This is going to go terribly
wrong.
"OK LET'S GET NYPD," says Chocolate Shayke for the eighth
time in two minutes. Panda has to stop for some Reese's Pieces and is
handing them out. He soon realizes he won't have enough to last him
the entire movie.
Shayke and Noodle have finally gone to get pizza and Scza Scza is
making friends with the woman at State Theatre.
Soon, it's just me, Morgana and Papa B. We make the snap decision
to bust out. After driving Morgana to his North Campus living, Papa B
and Ieat some NYPD and run into everyone from Daily Arts and their
dog. It was fate, can't fight that.

SPOTLIGHT
From Page 1B
Life-changing conversations
The University's TEDx
Conference, after all, invites
speakers - professionals,
educators, musicians and more -
from the campus and the broader
community that have contributed
. immense and inspiring change.
That's where the Spotlight Project
differs.
"What I like is how we're
involving stories that may be
common and everyday or typical,
but they're all amazing," Young
said. "I really believe that one
conversation - whether you're in
line for coffee or a bagel, can really
change your life," Young added. "I
love how it's archiving more and
more stories on this campus. And
it's so much more of a personal feel,
so what you get out of a Spotlight
interview is so different from a
TED Talk."
A TED Talk occurs on the
stage, in front of a large audience
of people. Yet the Spotlight
Project was much more intimate,
developed as a one-on-one
interview with the Spotlight
Project team. The Spotlight
Project videos are currently
uploaded on a video platform
website, where they offer
audiences a broader portrait of
the stories of passion and drive
cultivated on campus.
LSA senior Morgan Princing,
a TEDxUofM member and
interviewer for the Spotlight
Project, described the initiative
as a way to "continue the
conversation" that arises after
the TEDxUofM conference each
year.
"You go to any kind of event -
this isn't just for TED in general
- you go, and at the moment,
it's magical. You have all these
ideas, and you're so pumped up
about everything. But it's kind
of a bummer that everyone has
all these secret thoughts - your
motivations and your aspirations
- and after that, everything
kind of sizzles," Princing said.
"We don't need an event to
inspire. (The speakers) don't
have to be distinguished alumni,
or a professional who's doing
incredible work. While those are
very inspirational, there's also a
ton of potential in everyone who's
around you. They all have great
stories to tell."
The Spotlight Project
features interviews with a
wide range of community
members: an archivist, a food-
cart founder, a drum major,
soccer team co-captains, a social
entrepreneur, a conductor, a
Wikipedian, a speechwriter, a
Holocaust survivor ... friends,
mentors, audience members. All
the interviewees were chosen
or referred by the Spotlight
Project team, and all caught a
glimmer of an untold story - the
story of directing the Michigan
Marching Band, for example,
or a story of how a pianist grew
to love the piano. All of these
stories, according to Samuels, are
a key part of openingup curiosity
and expression in the campus
community, and additionally
showcasing the remarkable
potential of those around you.
"After I started (this project),
I wondered why I didn't start

it earlier, because, like so many

"What we were looking for were

During the interviews, Young
noted the occasional difficulty
in getting people to reveal their
stories in front of a camera.
"People hated that camera,"
Young said. "They were stones
in the beginning, so the first
challenge was to get them to

And notonlydid the teamhave
to hone in their listening skills.
Prior to beginning the project,
nobody on the team held any
film, book design or interviewing
experience. Yet the Spotlight
Project itself allowed Princing,
Samuels and Young to all develop
and experiment with skills that,
prior to the Project, were not in
practice.
"That's something TED has
really given me - is to take the
role of 'journalist,' " Samuels
said, smiling. "I've always loved
stories, and I've always loved the
power for giving people a voice. I
never had an outlet for that as an
engineering student."
Samuels talked about his
new passion for film, as a direct
result of being involved in the
Spotlight Project. "I learned

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY MARLENE LACASSE
from the folks that were (in the
Duderstadt Center), and I was
teaching myself. It was this
amazing world that opened up
to me with photography and film
that I had literally never dabbled
in," he explained. "There were
so many mistakes we made at
first. Like, we only had two lights
instead of four; or we should've
had a second camera angle. I
messed things up, and then I got
comfortable," Samuels said. "You
have to have pain to mess up."
Regardless of its challenges,
the Spotlight Project has now
culminated after nearly two
years of interviews and story
compilation. The Project has
taken its final form in a book,
designed and published this year.
The Spotlight Project book was a
way for the team to "think about
another entry point - another
medium," according to Samuels.
The book itself is rich with quotes
and full interviews from various
Spotlight Project interviewees,
including Ari Weinzweig,
co-founder of Zingermans; Buzz
Alexander, the Prison Creative
Arts Project founder; Alex Green,
founder of the first on-campus
student food co-op; Rich
Sheridan, the Chief Storyteller at
a software development factory;
and various others.
The Spotlight Project book is
currently sold on Amazon and
available for check-out at the Art
History Library. Furthermore,
Lab Cafe, ZingTrain and Nicola's
Books carry the book as well.
An exhibition of the Spotlight
Project is set to occur in Room
2435, North Quad from Nov. 8 to
Dec. 2.
Young reinforces that the
Spotlight Project itself arose
from one small spark, and
managed to fuse into a movement
with an impact. "When you have
an idea, no matter what it is, it's
so valuable, because it comes
from you," Young said. "We need
all these ideas to drive us and
make the day go on, and make the
world spin. You don't always have
to be doing things like getting As
and picking up garbage."
Samuels agreed. "Everybody
loves a good story. My hope is
that this project is just one small
piece of evidence for (people) to
follow their own curiosity. I was
following my own curiosity to try
and get to know people, to try and
find some hints of answers about
a subject I care about deeply -
which is human potential," he
said. "I hope peoples' curiosities
peak."
