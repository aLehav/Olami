Detroit native 

discusses evolving 

nature of community 

art installation

By NEALA BERKOWSKI

Daily Staff Reporter

Inside Rackham Auditorium 

on Thursday, Heidelberg Proj-
ect creator Tyree Guyton pub-

lically discussed the loss of six 
of the project’s art installations 
for the first time since a series 
of arsons hit the project over an 
eleven-month span.

During the talk, Guyton com-

pared the post-arson Heidelberg 
Project to a phoenix rising from 
the ashes. He said the destruc-
tion has allowed organizers and 
collaborators to reimagine the 
project, which he noted is not 
ending in any way.

“Looking at it from a philo-

sophical point of view, life is 
getting me ready for something 
greater,” he said.

Friday’s program featured 

Guyton and his wife, Jenenne 
Whitfield, executive director of 
the Heidelberg Project. Social 
Work Prof. Larry Gant, who also 
teaches in the School of Art & 
Design, moderated the discus-
sion, which was sponsored by 
the University’s Museum Stud-
ies Program

The Heidelberg Project is 

a community art project that 
features 
recycled 
materials 

and objects on and around Hei-
delberg Street in Detroit. The 
29-year-old installment is a 
popular Detroit cultural attrac-
tion that attracts people from 
around the world.

What 
began 
as 
Guyton’s 

response to neighborhood blight 
has since expanded to include a 
vision encompassing education, 
conversation and social change.

Three faculty 
committees will 
consider efforts to 

curb emissions 

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

In 2011, President Emerita 

Mary Sue Coleman introduced a 
new set of sustainability goals to 
be completed by 2025 and Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel 
aims to keep it moving.

According to the University’s 

Office of Campus Sustainability, 
the goals include reducing green-
house gas emissions by 25 per-
cent, transportation emissions by 
30 percent and waste tonnage by 
40 percent, all measured against 
a baseline from 2006.

Additionally, according to the 

initiative, the University is com-
mitted to ensuring 20 percent of 
dining hall food is “sustainable” 
— purchased from local produc-
ers within a 250-mile radius of 
Ann Arbor or certified by third 
parties, among other criteria.

Last semester, University Pres-

ident Mark Schlissel announced 

the University would review the 
sustainability goals in 2015 — a 
year earlier than initially sched-
uled.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily 
earlier 
this 

month, Schlissel said he wanted 
to address campus sustainability 
as early as possible.

“I figured if I was going to take 

a serious look and try to either 
re-energize or alter some of what 
we’re doing, it would make sense 
to do that serious review before I 
made changes in our program,” 
Schlissel said.

Three committees of faculty, 

staff and students are conducting 
the review. One team is review-
ing greenhouse gas emissions, 
another waste reduction and the 
final group is focusing on the cul-
ture of sustainability on campus.

Nicole Berg, coordinator for 

the Planet Blue Ambassador pro-
gram at the University’s Graham 
Sustainability Institute, said the 
review is expected to generate 
discussions on existing initia-
tives and the challenges they 
have faced.

“We’re doing a good job, but I 

think these committees are open-
ing up that conversation between

Students with 

financial need will 
be offered reduced-

price tickets 

By MAX COHEN 

and JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editors

The 
Michigan 
Athletic 

Department will announce a 
new policy Monday regarding 
the prices of student tickets, in 
which students demonstrating 
financial need are eligible for 
pricing discounts.

Students who meet the eli-

gibility criteria for the Federal 
Pell Grant will be able to pur-
chase season tickets for football, 
men’s basketball and hockey at 
a discounted rate. The standard 
prices for football, men’s basket-
ball and hockey tickets in 2015-
16 will be $175, $200 and $150, 
respectively, while the discount-
ed prices are $100, $120 and $90.

The 
University 
Office 
of 

Financial Aid’s website states 
that the need-based grants are 

awarded “only to the lowest-
income families,” and a student 
cannot receive the award “for 
more than 12 full-time semes-
ters.”

The 
Athletic 
Department 

announced 
in 
October 
the 

changes to football ticket pric-
es, which dropped from $295 
in 2014. The price is now lower 
than that of men’s basketball 
season tickets, which remained 
the same, though Dave Ablauf, 
the Associate Athletic Director 
for Public and Media Relations, 
noted that the per-game prices 
are still higher for football than 
for basketball.

Students can renew tickets 

beginning on March 11, and the 
renewal period lasts until March 
27 at 5 p.m. The seating policies 
will remain unchanged — for 
the 2015 football season, seat 
locations will be decided solely 
based on attendance and not on 
class level.

The 
idea 
for 
need-based 

pricing for tickets came from 
Central Student Government 
President Bobby Dishell. When 
Dishell worked with the Ath-

For the Daily

Members of the Univer-

the Rackham Amphitheatre 

on Friday for a screening of 
“Four Little Girls,” a documen-
tary that follows the four girls 
killed in the bombing of a Bir-
mingham, Ala. church in 1963.

Dale Long, who witnessed 

the bombing as an 11 year-old, 
facilitated a discussion fol-

Rise in juvenile delinquency 

ROBERT DUNNE/Daily

Wuhan Conservatory of Music Vocalist Yu Huicheng performs 
Hubei Folksong at the Musical Celebration of Chinese New Year 
at Rackham Auditorium on Saturday. 

NEW YE AR , NEW SONG

Figures from Detective 

George Simmons of the Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department 

revealed a steady rise in 
juvenile delinquency in Ann 
Arbor. 

In 1954, 878 juveniles were 

arrested for violating the law, 
and the majority were male 
and 16 years old.

AAPD officers said young 

people tend to develop nega-
tive attitudes toward uni-
formed policemen, which 
makes juvenile cases difficult 
to mitigate.

 To eliminate this bias 

and keep kids off the streets, 
Patrolman Chester Carter 
and other members of the 
police force arranged a year-

round program to develop 
constructive 
relationships 

between officers and local 
boys through outlets like 
organized sports.

“One of our main jobs is to 

get kids rid of the idea that 
policemen watch every move 
they make and that we are 
only here to stop their fun,” 
Simmons said.

38 years ago today 
(February 23, 1977)

The vast majority of the 

local chapter of the American 
Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees — 
a workers’ union — rejected 
a tentative contract agree-

ment with the University 
and voted to strike until the 
union was presented with a 
“more agreeable” contract.

Over 
2,300 
University 

service workers, including 
cafeteria, hospital, custodial 
and maintenance staffs went 
on strike. 

As a result, food opera-

tions 
in 
campus 
dorms, 

cleaning and maintenance 
operations and some hospital 
services were impacted. 

A number of offices and 

departments 
were 
subse-

quently notified that they 
could recruit outside help if 
necessary.

Debate on Zionism impacts 
Israeli election campaigns

Social identity and inclusion 
discussed at Ford School talk

Research finds 

belonging is lowest 
in residence halls, 
academic settings

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Topics related to self-identity 

and inclusion drove the conver-
sation Friday afternoon in the 
Ford School of Public Policy.

The Center for Public Policy 

in Diverse Societies, an initia-
tive housed in the Public Policy 
School, hosted “Social identity 
and inclusion: Undergraduate 
Experiences at the University of 
Michigan” as part of its Diversity 
Center Community Conversa-
tion series.

Sara Soderstrom, assistant 

professor 
of 
organizational 

studies, along with her team of 
researchers — Social Work stu-
dent Dan Green and Rackham 
students Sara Cohen and Terra 
Molengraff, a former Daily pho-
tographer — discussed the find-
ings of their recent research 
study on diversity and inclusion.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Soderstrom 

said the research team worked 
together last year in a course on 
higher education to design and 
implement an early version of 
what later became a fully funded 
research project.

The group was interested in 

the ways social identities, such 
as sexual identity, race and 
socioeconomic status, impact 
feelings of inclusion at the Uni-
versity.

“The data they collected from 

the class project was amazing, 
and we felt like we should for-
malize it, expand it, learn from 
it as a pilot, and that’s what 
launched the research project,” 
she said.

Once the research had been 

formalized 
and 
subsequently 

funded by the Diversity Center, 
the group gathered data pri-
marily through a survey sent to 
a random sample of University 
students through the Office of 
the Registrar.

The researchers also used 

tweets from the Black Student 
Union’s Being Black at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Twitter 
campaign, commonly known as 
#BBUM, and Michigan Daily 
content — such as Michigan in 
Color columns and Viewpoints 
— to gather data about minority 

perspectives on social inclusion.

During the last year, topics 

related to inclusion and diver-
sity have received attention 
from both the community and 
the University administration. 
Last week, University President 
Mark Schlissel held a leadership 
breakfast to launch a campus-
wide conversation on the topic 
and has promised to roll out a 
series of initiatives to diversify 
the University and improve cam-
pus climate.

According to Soderstrom’s 

presentation of the research 
findings Friday, data indicated 
residence halls and academic 
settings are where students have 
the lowest sense of belonging. 
Greek life and party culture also 
came up as places where stu-
dents reported they did not feel a 
great sense of belonging.

Correspondingly, 
students 

often reported feeling a greater 
sense of belonging at work and 
at student organizations where 
others around them shared simi-
lar interests.

The 
research 
study 
also 

showed white students feel less 
accepted individually than they 
believe white students on cam-
pus as a whole are accepted.

Prime Minister 
Netanyahu faces 
liberal opposition

JERUSALEM (AP) — What is 

Zionism? The ideological ques-
tion, rooted in the 19th century, 
has gained surprising urgency 
in an Israeli election campaign 
that seems more open than had 
been expected.

Seeking to take votes from 

the nationalistic right of Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
the relatively liberal opposi-
tion has rebranded itself as 
the Zionist Union — sparking 
a debate about a concept that 
some considered resolved when 
the Jewish state was declared 
and widely recognized in 1948.

Since adopting the name in 

early December, Isaac Herzog’s 
Labor Party — bolstered by a 
smaller grouping led by former 
opposition leader Tsipi Livni — 

has surged in the polls. They 
are now running neck-and-neck 
in the polls with Netanyahu’s 
Likud.

The debate over who best 

reflects the ideals of Zionism — 
and who can most credibly lay 
claim to its successes — has lent 
an oddly philosophical hue to a 
campaign that had been domi-
nated by more prosaic issues 
such as budget scandals in the 
management of the prime min-
ister’s residence. Along the way, 
the stage appears to have been 
set for a surprisingly climactic 
vote on March 17.

On the left, politicians speak 

of true Zionism as requiring 
the establishment of peace and 
equality in the land, including 
by making peace with the Pal-
estinians and giving up land if 
needed.

Netanyahu 
has 
mocked 

his rivals as “the anti-Zionist 
Union.” Backers of his Likud 
tend to equate the term with 
a strong Israel standing up to 
its enemies, and with the West 
Bank settler movement spe-
cifically. 
Ideological 
settlers 

view themselves as true Zion-
ists, called upon to reclaim the 
Holy Land in its entirety almost 
regardless of the consequences.

Danny Danon, a senior Likud 

parliamentarian, argued that 
the opposition was weakening 
Israel with excessive sympa-
thy for the Palestinians, alleg-
ing that some on the left have 
praised refusal to serve in the 
army or support the Arab view 
that the founding of the country 
was a catastrophe.

“Some in that camp are try-

ing to change the nature of Isra-
el and (use) the name Zionist 
Union to hide some of the com-
ments made by their members,” 
Danon said.

Hilik Bar, secretary-general 

of the Labor Party, counters 
that “we who are dealing with 
the most important things in 
society, aspire to reach peace 
and speak to our enemies — this 
is Zionism.”
See INCLUSION, Page 3A


Students of color felt accepted 
more individually than they 
believe minority students as a 
whole are accepted.

Overall, the data from the 

study indicated that social 
identity is the largest factor 
in minority students’ sense of 
“not belonging” to the Univer-
sity community.

Soderstrom and her team are 

hopeful that those who attend-
ed the event were inspired to be 
more aware of how social iden-
tity can impact University life.

“Our 
research 
questions 

were 
around 
just 
thinking 

about 
how 
social 
identity 

impacts 
undergraduate 
stu-

dent experiences,” Cohen said. 
“So if students left being more 

cognizant of that, if faculty 
left thinking about when orga-
nizing or structuring their 
classrooms, and engage the 
community around them, that’s 
a good thing.”

Soderstrom said she hopes 

sharing the results of the study 
prompts future discussions of 
social identity and inclusion.

“We 
have 
representation 

from a lot of different groups 
on campus that can impact 
different spaces on campus,” 
she said. “We hope that this 
prompts future conversations 
about things we can proac-
tively do and take control over, 
and how to structurally engage 
some of those spaces.

Soderstrom said she is hope-

ful the findings of the research 
project will be published for 
the University community in 
the near future.

Bradley 
Taylor, 
associate 

director of the Museum Stud-
ies Program and member of the 
project’s Board of Directors, 
said that despite destruction 
to some of the artwork, what 
remains is not to be discredited.

“There’s a belief out there 

that the fires have brought the 
Heidelberg Project to an end,” 
Taylor said. “That’s not true at 
all. If you’ve been out there the 
site’s been cleaned up and (Guy-
ton) is already out there creating 
new stuff in the foundations of 
the buildings that were burned 
down.”

Whitfield said the fire dam-

age is no longer visible, which 
surprises people who expect to 
see it when they come to view 
the art. She added that the fires 
have led to some positive out-
comes, including the installa-
tion of solar-powered lighting 
in the neighborhood and a new 
security system to monitor the 
art.

The recent string of arsons 

is not the first time the Heidel-
berg Project has faced adversity, 
Whitfield said. She noted that 
the project was partially demol-
ished by the city in 1991 and 1999 
amid pending safety concerns, 
local 
complaints 
about 
the 

crowds of visitors and general 
conversation asking whether or 
not the project was really “art.”

“Each time the Heidelberg 

Project was partially destroyed 
it came back stronger,” she said. 
“In my mind, what Tyree has 
done is he’s just created a new 
platform each time on the can-
vas.”

Whitfield said at the time, 

these obstacles proved chal-
lenging, but she and Guyton 
gained perspective over time.

“With the things that we 

went through, it grew us,” she 
said. “And so we can come to 
a point now and say, ‘that’s all 
part of the process. We know 
all this negativity is playing a 
big part in what we’re doing.’ 
But how we conclude it is what’s 
most important.”

Guyton said visitors have 

transformative 
experiences, 

often influenced by conversa-
tions between visitors attracted 
to the site.

“Heidelberg is the realest 

place,” Whitfield said. “I think 
one of our board members 
called it a sacred battleground 
that has taken all the scars of 
Detroit. It provides that plat-
form that people can discuss 
real issues.”

LSA senior Adam DesJar-

dins, who attended the discus-
sion, said he fell in love with the 
Heidelberg Project after many 
visits — showing friends and 
family around and talking to 
Tyree at the site.

“(Heidelberg) is just a real-

ly welcoming place, so to see 
(Guyton) speak and be recog-

nized was really cool,” he said. 
“I think his whole point about 
sparking creativity was really 
important in terms of find-
ing yourself and how you can 
spark other people’s creativity 
through your own creativity. I 
think that’s something that’s a 
takeaway for me because that’s 
so much of what (Guyton) does 
so well.”

One of the Heidelberg Proj-

ect houses is called the “Dotty 
Wotty House,” and Guyton’s 
mother currently lives in it. Tay-
lor said there are plans to poten-
tially convert the house into a 
museum.

Guyton added that students 

from the James & Grace Lee 
Boggs School, a local charter 
school, may soon begin work 
transforming 
an 
abandoned 

house adjacent to the school.

“We’re going to paint stars 

all over this house and the stars 
are going to be a reflection of 
these young people,” Guyton 
said. “Every one of those young 
people are stars, and my job is 
to help them to see that they’re 
stars.”

Taylor said two exhibitions 

of Guyton’s work are scheduled 
to run on campus this year. 
The University of Michigan 
Museum of Art will run one this 
summer and the Department 
of Afroamerican and Ameri-
can Studies Gallery will host a 
small exhibit on the main floor 
of Haven Hall.

Federal funding for 
Michigan roads 
reduced by 8 percent

 As Michigan readies for a 

vote on raising state taxes to 
smooth a deteriorating network 
of roads and bridges, one reason 
is because it’s contending with 
the reality that a significant 
source of money for the projects 
— federal aid — is down.

The Federal Highway Trust 

Fund, 
which 
accounts 
for 

nearly one-third of the state’s 
transportation 
budget, 
made 

about $1 billion available to 
Michigan in 2013. That’s 8 
percent less than five years 
earlier and 15 percent less when 
adjusted for inflation, according 
to figures compiled by The 
Associated Press.

The funding that generally 

comes from federal gasoline and 
diesel taxes was up 20 percent 
over a decade but down 5 percent 
in inflation-adjusted dollars.

LAKE OSWEGO, Oregon
Mothers question 
vaccine benefits

One is a businesswoman and 

an MBA graduate. Another is a 
corporate vice president. The 
third is a registered nurse.

These three mothers — all 

of them educated, middle-class 
professionals — are among the 
vaccine skeptics who have been 
widely ridiculed since more than 
100 people fell ill in a measles 
outbreak traced to Disneyland. 
Critics 
question 
their 

intelligence, 
their 
parenting, 

even their sanity. Some have been 
called criminals for foregoing 
shots for their children that are 
overwhelmingly shown to be 
safe and effective.

“Contrary to the common 

sentiment, we are not anti-
science,” said Michelle Moore, a 
businesswoman who lives in the 
affluent Portland suburb of Lake 
Oswego with her 2½-year-old 
twin girls. “I’m not opposed to 
medicine, and I think vaccines 
have a place. We think it’s a 
medical choice, and it should be 
researched carefully.”

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii
Crews free whale 
caught in crab line

A crew from the Hawai-

ian Islands Humpback Whale 
National Marine Sanctuary on 
Saturday used a pole equipped 
with a knife to saw the line free, 
West Hawaii Today reported.

Several hundred feet of heavy 

line used for hoisting crab pots 
was cut away, said sanctuary 
spokesman Ed Lyman.

Entanglements can result in 

drowning, starvation, infections 
and increased susceptibility to 
ship strikes, according to whale 
experts.

The entangled whale was 

spotted Feb. 13 off the Big 
Island’s Kona Coast by Big Island 
helicopter tour companies.

The West Hawaii Marine 

Mammal 
Response 
Network 

documented the whale’s condi-
tions and attached a tag allow-

Iran responds to 
U.S. nuclear talks

A senior Iranian official is 

responding sharply to warn-
ings that Washington is ready 
to quit nuclear talks unless Teh-
ran agrees to a deal that demon-

arms.

Ali Akbar Velayati says stay-

ing or leaving “depends on the 
Americans.”

Velayati was responding to 

U.S. Secretary of State John 
Kerry, shortly before Kerry’s 
arrival Sunday to Geneva. Kerry 
said President Barack Obama 
was “fully prepared” to pull 
the U.S. out before accepting a 
deal leaving Tehran with potent 
nuclear arms-making ability.

faculty, staff and students on the 
academic side and on the opera-
tion side and really help shape 
where those barriers are and how 
we can overcome them,” Berg said.

Andy Berki, manager of the 

Office of Campus Sustainabil-
ity, said he appreciated Schlissel’s 
interest in sustainability and looks 
forward to the recommendations 
yielded by the review.

“President Schlissel showed up 

on campus and when he arrived 
he very quickly demonstrated his 
commitment to sustainability and 
our efforts on campus,” Berki said. 
“I would expect to see some excit-
ing recommendations come out 
of the teams in June and I would 
think we should hear something 
on campus about the direction and 
recommendations of these teams 
by fall.”

Existing goals have achieved 

varying degrees of success. Berki 
said one of the more challeng-
ing initiatives has been reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2006, the University emit-

ted approximately 700,000 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide, Berki said. 
According to a report published by 
the OCS, the University emitted 
roughly the same amount in 2013.

Berki said the University plans 

to invest in a wind turbine project 
over the next several years. The 
initiative is in the “design phase,” 
and she said it could significantly 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
when implemented.

“A large project we’ve been 

working on for the last three 
or four years is to increase the 
amount of turbines at our power 
plant,” Berki said. “By doing this 
project with the turbines … we 
should reduce our overall carbon 
emissions by at least 100,000 to 
120,000 metric tons. So that will 
have a significant effect on moving 
our way toward our climate action 
goal of 510,000.”

Berki said another challenge 

has been reducing waste pro-
duction on campus. In 2006, the 
University’s total waste tonnage 
totaled about 13,170 tons, and in 
2013 it was 13,508 tons.

However, 
he 
acknowledged 

that the University’s continued 
expansion has made achieving 
these targets more difficult. While 
he said the University’s sustain-
ability practices have grown more 
efficient on a whole, the increase 
in facilities means total tonnage 
doesn’t reflect those improve-
ments.

“We’ve gone from about 28.5 

million square feet of infrastruc-
ture to about 35.5 million square 

feet of infrastructure over that 
time,” he said. “So actually, like 
a lot of our goals, we’ve kind of 
stayed steady but it’s a worthy note 
we’ve made some progress even 
though the University expanded 
significantly.”

Berki said while the University 

has developed a robust recycling 
program, the next step is to jump-
start a composting initiative.

“One area of our waste stream 

which we need to address is the 
waste that’s leaving our facilities 
that’s compostable,” he said. “Right 
now our institution does not have 
a University wide composting pro-
gram. Through our analysis we’ve 
identified that about 30 percent of 
our waste that’s leaving our facili-
ties could be composted.”

Berki said the Student Sustain-

ability Initiative, a collaborative 
group of sustainability organiza-
tions on campus, promotes zero-
waste initiatives at the University. 
SSI sponsors zero-waste events 
where napkins, utensils, plates 
and food are all composted.

Other goals have achieved 

more success. Berki said emis-
sions from University transpor-
tation operations have decreased 
significantly.

In 2006, 1.17 kilograms of car-

bon dioxide were emitted per 
ride, according to data reported 
by OCS. By 2013, the amount had 

decreased to approximately 0.91 
kilograms of carbon dioxide emit-
ted per ride. The ultimate goal is 
to reduce emissions to 0.82 kilo-
grams per ride.

Berki attributes these accom-

plishments to the University’s 
joint bike share program with the 
city, the 10 hybrid-electric buses 
used on campus and the vanpool 
program that allows University 
employees to carpool to work in 
University-sponsored vans.

Berg said the Planet Blue reus-

able water bottle initiative has 
also proved successful. The stu-
dent-led initiative provides all 
students living on-campus with 
a reusable water bottle and has 
worked to establish water bottle-
filling stations across campus.

“If you look around today com-

pared to three years ago I really 
just see everyone carrying a reus-
able water bottle and I think 
that’s a great way of sustainability 
really getting into culture,” Berg 
said. “That’s a very visible success 
story there.”

LSA junior Nicholas Jansen, 

an environmental science major, 
wrote in an e-mail interview that 
up until this year he was disap-
pointed by the University’s sus-
tainability efforts.

“I think the University up to 

this past year has done a sub-par 
job to improve sustainability on 

campus,” Jansen wrote. “Most of 
the sustainability improvements 
were applied to just a few build-
ings, we only focused on reduc-
ing our greenhouse gas emissions 
instead of trying to get more 
renewable energy on campus.”

However, he wrote that Schlis-

sel’s decision to convene the sus-
tainability review committees is a 
good sign.

“If the university actually 

listens to what these working 
groups recommend then I believe 
in the next few years, U of M can 
become a leader and model for 
sustainable campuses,” he wrote.

Berki also said it’s important 

that the University lead the nation 
in its sustainability efforts.

“As one of the renowned insti-

tutions of higher learning in the 
country and in the world, we 
need to set an example,” he said. 
“We are the leaders and best and 
I think a lot of people look to the 
University and the institution to 
see what we’re doing.”

Berg said the challenge moving 

forward would be expanding sus-
tainability efforts without adding 
a financial burden to the Univer-
sity’s budgets.

“There’s always a balance 

between helping people operate 
more sustainability without add-
ing to work loads or to cost,” she 
said.

moment in Black history, but 
for American history at large.

During the discussion, Long 

recounted his experiences with 
racial discrimination during 
the 1960s and described the 
hate that fueled the church 
bombing.

“I couldn’t believe it,” he 

said. “I could smell the gun-
powder and I couldn’t believe 
that they blew up the church 
with people in it. People were 
helping others down the stairs, 
people were bleeding … it 
freaked me out.”

Long said the 16th Street 

Bombing and subsequent death 
of the four girls was a turning 
point in the civil rights move-
ment, even attracting interna-
tional attention — the people 
of Wales even fundraised and 
designed replacement stained 
glass window for the church.

“I think that was one of the 

main catalysts that moved this 
country forward in terms of 

civil rights,” Long said.

LSA freshman Lauren Thom-

as, who attended the event, said 
the film gave her perspective 
beyond her day-to-day life.

“It is very emotional,” she 

said. “It was good to take a 
minute outside of classes and 
remember that there are real 
things happening in the world 
or that have happened.”

Charles Senteio, a Ph.D. can-

didate in the School of Informa-
tion who helped organize the 
event, said a goal for screening 
the film was to connect current 
events related to race and dis-
crimination with the past.

Noting that it’s often diffi-

cult to see ties to past injustic-
es, Senteio said it’s important to 
revisit history as a method for 
preventing similar atrocities in 
the future.

“The conversations we’ve 

had around this event are to try 
to learn from what has taken 
place before and absorb some 
wisdom, 
inspiration, 
some 

humanity from a road we’ve 
already been down before,” he 
said.

letic Department earlier in the 
school year to come up with a 
plan for lowering football ticket 
prices, he spoke with members 
of the Athletic Department 
about the possibility of special 
need-based pricing.

According to Dishell, the 

Athletic 
Department 
repre-

sentatives he spoke with about 
need-based 
pricing 
initially 

thought that the plan would 
be difficult to implement. But 
eventually, in conjunction with 
the Office of Financial Aid, a 
plan was worked out.

Dishell believes the avail-

ability of need-based pricing is 
the first of its kind in collegiate 
athletics.

“Michigan 
athletics, 
it’s 

something you see so many 
people rally around,” Dishell 
said over the phone Sunday 
night. “So many people you 
meet talk about their experi-
ence with Michigan athletics, 
and the prices were very high, 
extremely high. I kind of real-
ized, why shouldn’t your aid 
package expand? Why should it 
not carry over to another Uni-
versity unit?”

The Office of Financial Aid 

will begin emailing eligible 
students Monday with instruc-
tions detailing how to purchase 
tickets.

communities.

“We’re trying to hear as 

many different voices as pos-
sible in order to continue to 
be able to create such positive 
change on campus as we’ve 
done in the past,” Pidgeon said.

Charlton has not served 

as a member of CSG, but Pid-
geon noted he co-founded the 
Wolverine Support Network, 
a University-wide peer sup-
port network and one of Make 
Michigan’s central initiatives 
this year.

“With Cooper at the helm, 

given his positions within ath-
letics, we can take on a more 
collaborative approach with 
the Athletic Department in the 
coming year,” Pidgeon said.

In an e-mail interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Charlton 
wrote taht his position as presi-
dent of SAAC during a time 
of change within the Athletic 
Department has prepared him 
for the CSG presidency.

As president of SAAC, Charl-

ton co-authored a viewpoint 
in which the committee criti-
cized 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel’s comments at 
a meeting of the University’s 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs. During 
that meeting, Schlissel called 
into question the academic 
qualifications of some student 
athletes. The viewpoint argued 
that the perception of student 
athletes is easily swayed by the 
media and public opinion.

In 
the 
e-mail 
interview, 

Charlton also said his expe-
riences 
complemented 
Hal-

perin’s leadership experiences 
on campus.

“My relationships with the 

current 
members 
of 
Make 

Michigan, and Steven’s experi-
ence within CSG compliment 
my Michigan experiences and 
perspectives resulting in a 
very balanced executive tick-
et,” Charlton wrote. “We both 
come from very different back-
grounds however share similar 
values.”

Pidgeon 
noted 
Halperin’s 

leadership both inside and out-
side of CSG as the reason he was 
selected for the vice presiden-
tial nomination. Halperin is the 
vice chair of CSG’s task force 
to create a new honor code, an 
LSA dean ambassador and the 
Interfraternity Council’s vice 
president of internal recruiting.

If elected, Halperin said he 

wants to expand the Night Owl 
bus route, increase lighting 
around campus and link CTools 
syllabuses with Google calen-
dar. He would also like to focus 
on larger campus concerns.

“I have been working very 

closely with SAPAC to make a 
positive change in the Greek 
community 
and 
plan 
on 

expanding 
across 
campus,” 

Halperin wrote in an e-mail to 
The Michigan Daily.

The U.S. Department of Edu-

cation is currently investigat-
ing the University’s handling of 
sexual misconduct allegations 
on campus.

As a whole, Make Michigan 

organizers and candidates said 
they hope to continue working 
on student health. Pidgeon said 

along with Wolverine Support 
Network, Make Michigan has 
plans to increase other mental 
health services as well.

“We want to build on that 

success of keeping students 
physically 
and 
emotionally 

safe,” Pidgeon said.

“Through 
de-stigmatizing 

mental well being on campus 
we will be able to accomplish 
goals once thought to hard to 
reach,” Charlton wrote. “Tra-
dition runs deep through the 
academic excellence of our 
students, however it is time to 
include emotional development 
in that tradition.”

The party has not released 

an entire platform because 
they want to wait until they 
receive feedback from constitu-
ents. Make Michigan created 
a Google form for students to 
submit issues they feel need to 
be addressed on campus. The 
form is available on their web-
site and on Facebook.

“We can have a platform that 

we as a party think the students 
want but also what students 
really do want,” Pidgeon said.

Last week, The Team, a new 

campus party that will also run 
candidates in this year’s elec-
tion, announced an executive 
ticket headed by LSA junior 
William Royster, a member of 
the Black Student Union, and 
LSA sophomore Matt Fidel, a 
current CSG representative.

Polls will open online March 

25 and 26.

I

t all started a couple years ago, sitting 
around a circle in the lodge right off of 
Lake Winnipesaukee. I was a student of 

the New England Literature 
Program, 
arguably 
the 

most important academic 
experience 
I 
have 
had 

across my time as a student. 
On week four, day six, my 
mentor, teacher and friend 
Nick Harp was holding an 
advice chat. I needed to 
attend. I have always been 
a fan of this stuff. In high 
school, my friend Michael 
and I once attempted to 
run an advice column for 
our school paper, The Mirador. We made up 
problems and characters and advised our 
make believe friends in the least helpful kind 
of ways. You could say I am an expert. So 
naturally, I felt obliged to impart my wisdom 
on Nick’s discussion.

Nick began the hour by asking us about a 

subject on which we might seek help. I wrote 
something down that I am still working 
through these days — the current crossroads 
of where I’m at right now and maybe where I 
will always find myself. Specifically, I’m now 
working through the crossroads we all find 
ourselves at as our time as undergraduates 
comes to a culmination.

I 
wrote 
about 
the 
difficulties 
and 

complications of choosing a path, not just 
a career path but a “path” path : “I keep 
ruminating around this idea … should I dive 
into a creative, experimental, entrepreneurial 
world or should I take a more traditional path 
with the goal of financial stability?” I felt 
as though if I lived in a world where I acted 
entirely out of self-interest with little regard 
for others, I would pursue the artistic parts 
of my brain. I would write, paint and create 
little boutique businesses with some sort of 
philanthropic cause. Alternatively, I felt that 
if I intended to one day to support my current 
family, my future family, friends and those less 
fortunate than me, I would dive into a more 
traditional career such as law or consulting 
(this, of course, would be no easy feat).

At the time of NELP, during the summer 

2013, I felt as though these two paths were 
mutually exclusive. The ideas of money 
and the arts don’t necessarily align in my 
mind, but I have attempted to re-shape my 
understanding of the possibility, reshaping 
the idea that I can create my own path. I 
don’t necessarily belong in an art community 
and I don’t necessarily belong in corporate 
America. This same summer, I felt like there 
was a decision I had to make. I felt like I had to 
put myself in one box and stick there. I don’t 
think the path is twofold anymore. It feels the 
most “me” to bridge the gaps of business and 
the arts, so I will attempt to do this to the best 
of my ability.

This fall of 2014 I interviewed Nick. We 

returned to the idea of advice and he told me, 
“I’m always wary of advice because I think 
to myself, how should I know what is best for 
someone else? How could I know? So I try (and 
often fail) to give advice only when I am asked 
directly, and even then I think all advice should 
come with a hefty grain of salt. I think when 
people ask for advice, what they are really doing 
is asking if they can talk about this thing with 
you and figure out what they already know or 
how to answer their own question. Good advice 
is rarely about directing someone as much as it 
is about bearing witness.”

In order to help reach my current 

understanding of my future and myself, it 
took time. It took many more discussions 
with people and the help of friends and 
mentors to help pick at my brain. Watching 
my writing evolve from my summer crisis of 
2013 to my current self, I have borne witness 
to exactly what was discussed at Nick’s advice 
chat at NELP. No one endowed me with an 
understanding of what I should do with my 
life, but rather my ideas formed through a 
constant process of being asked questions and 
speaking with people of all ages and facets of 
knowledge. Family, friends and mentors can 
offer you a walk in someone else’s shoes or a 
wealth of knowledge and experience, but no 
one really knows the best decision for you 
other than yourself.

I was studying with my friend in the 

UGLi last week when my mom sent me a text 
regarding my latest venture. It read, “Sorry 
for raining on your parade. But I get the

Why you’re not getting my blood

(But I really wish you were) 

I was walking through the Diag 

recently, something that I have done 
much less frequently since all of 
my classes are now in the School of 
Public Health. As per usual, I was 
able to sneak by the two gatekeepers 
with flyers at the corner I was walk-
ing through. Near the M, I heard 
“DONATE TO MOTT!” and a change 
jar jingling, and I turned and recog-
nized one of my former advisees. We 
said hi, and I kept walking toward the 
exit of the Diag toward the UMMA. I 
saw two people there. I was the only 
one walking toward them.

“Shit,” I thought, “I’m not getting 

out of this one.” I didn’t even have 
earbuds to pretend like I couldn’t 
hear them.

“Will you donate blood?” asked one 

of the girls.

Now I’ve been asked this question 

dozens of times, and usually I just 
smile, say sorry and move on with my 
life. But something was different this 
day. For some reason, I was angsty, and 
my frustration with this issue finally 
manifested itself verbally. I stopped 
in my tracks, made a 90-degree turn, 
looked this girl right in the eyes, and 
calmly (but with my high level of sass) 
said “I’ll donate blood when all gay 
people can donate blood.”

I don’t know why I said “gay” rather 

than “men who have sex with men,” 
as I myself am bisexual, but that was 
what came out of my mouth in the heat 
of the moment.

The look on her face was price-

less and completely startled. It was 
unclear if she had no idea what I was 
talking about, or if I scared her. She 
was clearly uncomfortable, and I don’t 
blame her. All she could squeak out 
was “Okay...” as I walked away.

In reality this girl had nothing to do 

with the Food and Drug Administra-
tion policy that bans blood from men 
who have sex with men, but at that 
place and time she had everything to 
do with it.

This policy to turn away blood dona-

tions from any man who’s had sex with 
men started in the heyday of the AIDS 
crisis in the 1980s, when HIV was 
not being detected in donated blood. 
Due to this lack of testing capabilities, 
HIV was subsequently transfused 
into other patients, causing them to 
become infected with the (at that time) 
fatal virus.

Since then, many things have 

changed. Bigotry and stereotyping, 
however, still run rampant.

It is no secret that Americans still 

think of HIV/AIDS as the “gay dis-
ease,” only fueling the homophobic 
fire. Do you know that straight men 
and women can get HIV/AIDS as 
well? They constitute over a third 
of the diagnoses, yet we’re not con-
cerned enough about their blood to 
enact bans.

Although men who have sex with 

men are more likely to acquire HIV 
than those who engage in hetero-
sexual contact, (because of behav-
ior factors such as condomless 
anal sex, combined with the com-
munity’s viral load) this cannot be 
an excuse to discriminate against 
all of them. Instead of stereotyp-
ing everyone in this category, why 
can’t we switch to a screening sys-
tem in which people are turned 
away from donating because of par-
ticipation in evidence-based risk 
behaviors? Screening for unpro-
tected sex with someone whose 
HIV status is unknown or positive 
would be a more effective tactic. 
This screening should be the same 
for all genders, as condomless anal 
sex is risky for heterosexual inter-
actions as well. Why are men who 
have sex with men and transgender 
women the only groups who are 
discriminated against? In addition 
to stereotyping men who have sex 
with men, the fact that transgender 
women are turned away shows that 
our society still conflates gender 

identity with sexual behavior in a 
problematic way.

Today, three decades later, we 

have advanced screening tests 
that can detect HIV within weeks, 
sometimes days, of the time of 
infection. But the United States 
chooses to use outdated tests, that 
pool multiple samples of blood 
together, as this methodology can 
be cheaper and easier.

This means that if one donation 

had HIV in it, the others could pos-
sibly dilute it so it would appear 
virus-free on the test. Not only does 
the U.S. have an outdated policy, 
but also an outdated test.

While I don’t know when testing 

procedures will change, the life-
time ban on “gay blood” did change 
a couple of months ago, but it’s 
 

still problematic.

The FDA policy was recently 

changed from a lifetime ban for 
men who have sex with men to a 
one-year abstinence period. This 
means that if I don’t have sex with 
another male for one year, I can 
donate my blood. Unfortunately, my 
boyfriend and I don’t plan on stay-
ing off of each other for that long 
just to give blood to a system that 
thinks we are hazardous. I think 
that sentiment holds true for many 
other gay, bi and queer men.

The one-year ban might as well 

be a lifetime ban.

I don’t even know my blood 

type, because I have never been 
allowed to get to that stage in the 
 

donation process.

My blood is not dirty, not dis-

eased, and no better or worse than 
 

anyone else’s.

I could have already donated 

about 36 times, and as the Red 
Cross would say, I could have saved 
108 lives.

I’ve saved zero lives because 

of an outdated policy based on 
homophobia and bigotry.

VIGNOS

D

ear Seniors,

It has been a wild 

ride, but our time here 

at 
Michigan 
is 

almost done. We 
have been here 
for four(ish) years, 
starting out with 
our 
orientation 

in the sweltering 
heat of East Quad, 
our goofy lanyards 
and our admira-
tion 
for 
dining 

hall food. We were 
undecided 
and 

ready to be in 32 
clubs, excited to play our first ever beer 
 

pong game.

Times sure have changed.
We’ve grown up, made some 

memories, probably done some stu-
pid stuff and either owned it or are 
a little ashamed, but we will defi-
nitely remember those moments 
when we all part ways in a couple of 
months. The thing that we are going 
to remember the most, though, is 
the friends we have made along 
the way, the ones who have left an 
imprint in our hearts and changed 
 

our character.

I’m not trying to sound like the 

“Friends Forever” song by Vita-
min C, all sappy and sentimental. 
After we graduate, yes, things will 
change. People go to different jobs 
around the country and world, some 
will be making great money, some 

will be living with their parents 
for a while. But however we start 
our lives after college, it will be a 
new beginning for us. Being there 
for our closest friends will now be 
more difficult. It is not as simple as 
hanging out on a Saturday, getting 
lunch at No Thai! and recapping the 
previous night’s events. It will take 
more effort to compensate for the 
distance between us. The relation-
ship needs to be a two-way street, 
not a one-way that someone acci-
dentally goes down the wrong way. 
It’s work, but if you both believe 
that it is of value, then it will last 
beyond the day we exit the Big 
House as graduates.

I had a dream recently where 

someone told me I was going to 
die within a year. A little scary at 
first, but I took it as an opportunity 
to change some things in my life. 
My first thought was to figure out 
who should be in my life, and who 
should be gone. I went running 
around to everyone I knew, either 
saying “I love you!” or “Fuck off, I 
don’t need you in my life!” Person to 
person, I put people into these two 
categories. To be honest, it was very 
therapeutic. I felt as if I was ridding 
myself of extra weight, lobbing off 
negativity and people who brought 
anger into my life.

I woke up with such a new view. 

I now could see those through-
out my day that I wanted to be in 
my life from here on out, and for 

those that I couldn’t care less about 
after, I plan to part ways. Why not 
make my dream come to fruition? 
Why keep those gloomy people in 
 

my life?

From what I’ve heard, the real 

world is tough. There are bosses 
who might be mean and co-workers 
who might be incompetent, but for 
those people in your life that you can 
choose, keep them positive. Coming 
to college, we had a chance to have 
a clean slate, start a new page and 
maybe recreate ourselves. After 
college, we have the ability to start 
fresh again, make new friends that 
fit into our personalities and pref-
erences. What is the point of vol-
untarily choosing something that 
is bad for you? Surround yourself 
with supportive people, those who 
will call you out on questionable 
behavior, those who will give you 
the best advice, those who will have 
 

your back.

But why wait? Start now. Don’t 

just hold off on getting rid of these 
damaging people. Start phasing 
them out or just let them know to 
their face. You do not need them 
in your life if they are only causing 
 

you grief.

There are going to be so many 

people 
and 
circumstances 
that 

bring us down. We need to keep 
those that are good company near.

sense that your dreams are a result of 
opportunities that present themselves 
to you instead of the other way around. 
I think you need to look deep inside 
and think bigger. I really don’t feel as 
this is going to serve you well and that 
you will tire of it very quickly from 
the monotony and not being around 
stimulating and creative people.” 
Speaking from a mother’s perspective, 
I believed this to be honest advice. It 
was at least something I should think 
deeply about, as she stated. I then 
read it out loud to a friend. He thought 
about her words for a moment and 

said, “Do you think she is right?” This 
was some of the best advice I have 
ever received.

If you want my advice, which 

many may not, I will always say go 
for it. When it comes to business 
plans, adventures and relationships, 
I will always say take it to the 
limits. It will most likely lead me to 
my biggest regrets and my largest 
accomplishments, but it is an 
adventure I am excited to take.

When I am asking for advice, I 

am asking someone to help pick my 
mind, to ask me questions that will 

lead me to make the best decision 
for me. I am not really asking what 
would you do, but rather I am saying, 
“Can you ask me about things I 
should consider or weigh in my own 
decision making process?”

I have still not figured out how to 

be the best advisor for my friends 
and family, but I do know that I am 
working on it. I may never truly 
know, but asking questions is always 
a good start.

I

took a trip back to my hometown 
recently to have dinner with my family. 
Between work, school and everything 

else I’ve got going on, it 
can be difficult to sync my 
schedule 
with 
everyone 

else’s. But when I told my 
mom that I had a Friday off 
from work she insisted that 
I make the drive home. She 
wanted my siblings to meet 
my boyfriend.

My 
coming-out 

experience with my family 
was 
truly 
a 
non-event. 

Throughout high school and 
college I’d brought home a 
string of girlfriends, all of which were accepted 
by my loud, cocktail-loving siblings and parents. 
Bringing my boyfriend home really wasn’t any 
different: we ate a lot of food and pillaged my 
step-dad’s liquor cabinet.

It was an incredibly normal evening — my 

family’s acceptance, however, is definitely not 
the norm, though I’d understand why some 
would believe it to be.

On Feb. 9, Alabama became the 37th state in 

the Union to grant marriage licenses to same-
sex couples, becoming the latest domino to fall 
in a line of states that have ratified marriage 
equality. Actually, due to the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s agreement to review a Michigan 
case challenging the state’s ban on same-sex 
marriage, we may very well see nationwide 
marriage equality in early spring.

An apparent social change is occurring, 

and it seems as if media reflects that. The 
sitcom “Modern Family” positively depicts 
a monogamous gay couple and their familial 
dynamics. Even non-heteronormative aspects 
of gay society are being popularized — 
“Looking,” an HBO drama following the lives of 
three 30-something gay men in San Francisco, 
frequently details the Grindr hookups and 
illicit drug use that characterize certain axioms 
of gay culture.

But in reality, the lives of many identifying as 

LGBTQ are not that cushy.

LGBTQ-identifying youth, for example, 

experience homelessness at a startlingly 
disproportionate rate than other affected 
groups. The Ruth Ellis Center — among other 
organizations — estimates that some 40 
percent of the 1.6 million homeless youths in 
this country identify as LGBTQ. That’s huge, 
especially when considering that a mere 3.5 
percent of all adults even place themselves on 

that spectrum in the first place.

Carl Siciliano, founder and executive director 

of the Ali Forney Center in New York City — 
purportedly the nation’s largest organization 
combating LGBTQ youth homelessness — says 
this statistic is the direct result of a generation 
“living in a societal moment” of believed 
LGBTQ acceptance.

The 
media 
increasingly 
popularizes 

gay culture and, when combined with 
the progression of marriage equality, the 
assumption purveys that youths will be 
accepted by their families and peers if they 
come out of the closet. This is often not the 
case. In fact, according to one comprehensive 
study on the topic, familial rejection is the main 
contributing factor to queer homelessness.

As Siciliano says, in a 2011 interview with 

NPR’s Margot Adler, “… there are so many 
parents who can’t be parents to their gay kids.”

Dissent of a gay lifestyle is not uncommon — 

one Pew Forum survey indicates that 40 percent 
of the nation still opposes allowing same-sex 
couples to marry. And according to the National 
Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 2013 saw 
a 21-percent increase in physical anti-LGBTQ 
hate violence, particularly against transgender 
women of color and gay men — this in a year 
where “Orange is the New Black” and “Looking” 
popularized these respective identities.

Society is really not as accepting of 

queerness as the current “societal moment” 
may convey. Though a decision by the U.S. 
Supreme Court affirming the right of same-sex 
couples to marry would indeed catalyze further 
progression toward full codification of LGBTQ 
rights, it won’t be a silver bullet.

Having the liberty to choose whom I’d like to 

marry won’t dissipate the anxiety with which 
I’m fettered while walking down the street 
with my boyfriend. Allowing us to marry won’t 
make the stares I get when going in for a kiss 
any less frightening.

It won’t get those hundreds of thousands 

of kids off the street, and it won’t make their 
parents any more accepting. Marriage equality 
is a good first step, but it is just that — a single 
step. A marathon needs to be run before 
otherness, hate and ignorance are no longer 
socialized associations with queer community.

Any person thinking otherwise need only 

turn away from the rosy depictions of this 
“societal moment” on their television sets, and 
instead open their eyes to reality.

DETROIT ARTS COLUMN

Tyree Guyton’s 

‘Inextinguishable’ 
Heidelberg Project
I

t was almost 30 years 
ago 
when 
Detroiter 

Tyree Guyton had a 

self-proclaimed epiphany. He 
closed 
his 

eyes and he 
saw 
“it” 
— 

“it” being the 
street of his 
youth painted 
with 
bright-

ly 
colored 

polka 
dots, 

the 
hous-

es 
covered 

in 
records, 

clocks hang-
ing from trees, abandoned 
structures smothered under 
sagging 
stuffed 
animals. 

He wanted to create an art 
installment that would make 
the street safer by combating 
blight, and serve as medicine 
to his neighborhood. Guyton 
made the Heidelberg Project 
a reality, so that anyone could 
visit Heidelberg Street and see 
the “it” that he once only saw 
in his head.

That is, until the arsons 

started.

 
A rabbi and a prostitute 
visit Heidelberg Street
 
In an event titled “Inex-

tinguishable: A conversation 
with Detroit Artist Tyree 
Guyton” on the fourth floor of 
Rackham Auditorium on Fri-
day, Guyton made one of his 
first public appearances since 
the rash of arsons started 
in 2013. Clad in a University 
of Michigan hoodie and tan 
cargo pants, he sat between 
his wife Jennene Whitfield, 
and his friend, Social Work 
prof. Larry Gant.

A 
group 
of 
Heidelberg 

employees sat on the stairs 
of 
the 
auditorium, 
one 

wearing a shirt that reads 
“ART>ARSON.” 
Whitfield 

and 
Guyton 
explained 
to 

the audience and Gant that 
the Heidelberg faced adver-
sity well before the arsons 
began — back in the 1990s, 
under orders from the city of 
Detroit, several Heidelberg 
houses were demolished.

“If you’re going to do some-

thing in this world,” Guy-
ton said whimsically, “you’re 
going to have to pay a price.”

As they spoke, it was obvi-

ous that Whitfield works as 
Guyton’s foil. Guyton spewed 
artistic idioms and famous 
quotes like he was recit-
ing slam poetry and Whit-
field would take those ideas 
and bring them back down to 
earth. The two spoke of the 
project candidly, as if it were 
alive.

 “I know I talk about it like 

a thing, but that’s what it’s 
like to me now. It’s like a baby 
I wish would grow the fuck 
up,” Whitfield said, eliciting a 
laugh from the audience.

“What are you drinking, 

honey?” Guyton asked her.

The 
Heidelberg 
project, 

despite 
the 
numerous 
set-

backs, is a place where Guy-
ton hopes that art can bring 
people from different cultures 
together. Visitors from around 
the world can be found driving 
through Detroit’s East side to 
see the renowned art install-
ment. 
Whitfield 
said 
that 

sometimes there are ten coun-
tries on Heidelberg street in 
one day.

“The 
Heidelberg 
project 

reaches so many different 
countries, people, situations, 
circumstances … I mean we 
actually had a rabbi talking 
to a prostitute,” Whitfield 
said, making the audience 
laugh again. “I do think it was 
amazing that she felt comfort-
able on that street to talk to 
him, and he felt comfortable 
too.”

These things happen, Whit-

field explained, because art is 
the great equalizer.

 

A city on fire

 
From 2013 to 2014, there 

were 12 fires on Heidelberg 
Street. Despite crowd fund-
ing efforts and extra security 
measures, there are currently 
no leads on the culprit that 
has burnt down or severely 
damaged several parts of the 
installment.

“In order to get light you 

need negative and positive. 
There is something to be said 
about accepting negativity as 
a natural part of the process,” 
Whitfield said. “We accepted 
the fires. It was an unauthor-
ized transformation.”

With no leads, the Hei-

delberg 
Project 
has 
faced 

proposed 
conspiracies 
and 

non-stop 
questions: 
Who 

would want burn the houses 
down? To what end? Does 
the project’s staff know more 
than they are letting on? Is 
the city in some way involved? 
The questions are endless and 
the answers are unknown, 
but this doesn’t bother Tyree 
Guyton.

“Paige, I don’t even listen 

to it,” Guyton told me during 
a phone interview. “I listen 
to what’s in me. Because if I 
listened to that it would drive 
me crazy and have me run-
ning around here like a mad 
person. I’ve heard some of 
everything.”

Though Heidelberg is just 

one street, the arsons that 
have plagued the project are 
representative 
of 
a 
larger 

problem facing the city of 
Detroit. According to a recent 
Detroit News investigation, 
there were more than 9,000 
suspicious fires from 2010 to 
2013, and at least 66 percent of 
those burnt houses have yet to 
be demolished.

Neighborhoods in South-

west Detroit and Detroit’s East 
Side show the heaviest amount 
of arson damage, with more 
than 200 fires from 2010-2013 
in the Heidelberg’s zip code 
alone.

“I want to send love out to 

the person that has been set-
ting this project on fire,” Guy-
ton said to the audience at 
Rackham. “I want to do some-
thing a little bit different by 
sending out love, and that’s 
how you educate people.”

Professor Gant looked at 

Guyton incredulously. “Could 
we kick their ass a little bit 
first though?” he asked. Whit-
field agreed.

“Well then you guys do 

that,” Guyton said “and I’m 
gonna’ love. And I’m gonna’ 
kick their ass by loving them.”

 

“Heidelberg rising 

from the ashes”

 
Guyton and the project will 

be celebrating their anniver-
sary with an exhibition at the 
University of Michigan Muse-
um of Art called “30 Years of 
Heidelberg” in August.

“After 30 years what do you 

know now, Tyree,” Guyton 
said of the exhibition. “I know 
that I can do anything and 
everything. And then some-
thing that Socrates said: I 
know nothing. I’m still learn-
ing.”

Also in the works for Guy-

ton is a possible trip to Berlin, 
along with some Detroit tech-
no legends that have yet to be 
announced.

Whitfield said that while 

the rest of the Project’s staff 
continues to deal with secur-
ing funds and keeping the 
project safe, Guyton’s sole 
responsibility will be focusing 
on his art.

“It’s just a new canvas,” 

Whitfield said. “We will be 
there. And we will continue 
on.”

Big Sean stays true 
to himself on new LP

By KENNETH SELANDER 

Daily Arts Writer

Big Sean’s third album, Dark Sky 

Paradise, is an odd mix of classic 
Big Sean explicitness and unex-
pectedly 
deep 

songs, present-
ing a collection 
of catchy club 
tunes and emo-
tional tracks.

First 
and 

foremost, 
I 

appreciate that 
Big Sean stays 
true to himself 
on this album. It seems today that 
all too many rappers are trying to 
imitate the Atlanta sound that has 
been dominating rap recently. If 
Big Sean’s 2012 mixtape Detroit 
isn’t enough proof, mentions of 
Little Caesar’s on “All Your Fault,” 
among other Detroit, Michigan 
references in Dark Sky Paradise 
make it clear that he’s not try-
ing to claim that Atlanta adopted 
him. In “Paradise,” Big Sean raps 
“I’m from the D, fuck your A-list.” 
While this line means a number of 
things, I like to think on some level 
it’s a rejection of this trend.

The album’s musical content is 

diverse, which sometimes reates 
an odd juxtaposition. For instance, 
in the record’s first song, “Dark Sky 
(Skyscrapers),” Sean starts the sec-
ond verse with “Bitch, watch how 
you speak to me,” but by the end of 
the same verse makes an allusion 
to police brutality (a theme also 
brought up by his mentor Kanye 
West on “All Your Fault.”)

Perhaps the epitome of Big 

Sean’s self-absorbed, dirty talk 
rap that is ever-present on Finally 
Famous and Hall of Fame is his hit 
single “I Don’t Fuck With You.” 
The name says it all. In the cho-
rus, the line “I got a million trillion 
things that I’d rather fuckin’ do,” is 
just plain silly. Yet at the same time, 
it’s hard to deny how catchy the 
song is — a result of the production 
just as much as the simple chorus. 
Both DJ Mustard and Kanye West 
produce the song, and Kanye’s 
soulful sample meshes well with 
DJ Mustard’s catchy driving beat.

Beyond “I Don’t Fuck With 

You,” the album’s production is 
solid. Samples like “How Much I 
Feel” by Ambrosia and “Piece of 
My Love” by Guy add interest to 
songs otherwise dominated by 
the monotone sound of Big Sean’s 
voice.

Dark Sky Paradise’s features are 

nothing new. Big Sean has done a 
few songs with Kanye before (like 
“Marvin and Chardonnay”) and 
Lil Wayne (“Beware”). Big name 
Drake is featured on “Blessings.” It 
seems like he’s pulling on his big-
gest connections to boost record 
sales. I can’t blame him when, 
considering his emphasis on mak-
ing money, Hall of Fame didn’t sell 
many more than 100,000 copies. 

Looking back on Finally Famous, 

while the album was aestheti-
cally pleasing, it was mostly void 
of meaning. “Don’t Tell Me You 
Love Me” is probably the only song 
with some personal connection or 
emotion, and it’s about cheating on 
his girlfriend. Nasty club hits like 
“A$$,” and “Marvin and Chardon-
nay” definitely drive the record.

His sophomore album Hall of 

Fame gives off a laid back, stoner 
vibe. There are a handful of more 
thoughtful songs on the record, 
particularly “World Ablaze” and 
“Ashley,” which allows Hall of 
Fame to separate itself from Final-
ly Famous. Yet, filthy songs like 
“Mona Lisa,” “MILF” and the per-
verted skit “Freaky” are also pres-
ent on the record. What a mix.

While Dark Sky Paradiseand 

Hall of Fame share a juxtaposition 
of meaningful and explicit songs, 

in the former the balance tips in 
the direction of more meaningful 
ones. Tracks like “Play No Games,” 
and “Stay Down,” are void of much 
depth, but “One Man Can Change 
the World,” is extremely touch-
ing. Like “World Ablaze,” touch-
ing on his ex-girlfriends mother‘s 
battle with cancer (on his sopho-
more album), the passing of Big 
Sean’s grandmother provides a 
great platform for him to elevate 
the personal and artistic value of 
his work. Better yet, “Outro” gives 
off an uplifting feeling to finish the 
album, an effective transition from 
the heartache of “One Man Can 
Change The World.” On the other 
hand, “I Know” is also supposed to 
be a deep song about heartbreak, 
but lacks energy and I didn’t feel 
the execution. I do appreciate the 
concept, though.

It appears Big Sean chal-

lenges himself to progress a bit 
on Dark Sky Paradise, likely with 
the encouragement of Kanye. 
The album features some the-
matically substantive lyrics and 
music, but is still cautious about 
deviating too far from the Finally 
Famous mentality that got him 
big label money – he’s testing the 
bath water. If the record sells, 
maybe we’ll see more emotional 
songs from Big Sean. He has an 
ultra-smooth flow and certainly 
knows his way around a beat, 
giving him the potential to make 
hits that aren’t just meant to be 
banged at a party. Just please 
don’t write a grimy love ballad to 
Ariana Grande.

‘Big Bang’ director 
talks hit CBS show

Mark Cendrowski 
discusses science’s 
role in TV series 

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Late on Friday afternoon a 

group of students gathered in 
1400 Chem for the opportunity 
to have Mark Cendrowski answer 
their questions. Cendrowski, most 
famous for being the lead director 
on the well-known TV series 
“The Big Bang Theory,” spent two 
hours with students, answering 
their questions about what it was 
like to work in the highest-rated 
comedy on television and in the 
TV industry in general. 

After talking about the large 

mix of concentrations in the 
room (the event was advertised 
to people from everyone from 
film majors to Physics majors), 
Cendrowski discussed how the 
physics community has embraced 
and loved the show. The set also 
has intense conversation about 
science. Neil DeGrasse Tyson 
was on the show right after he 
debunked Pluto and got into a 
heated debate with members of 
the crew about the subject. He 
was also proud of how the show 
has led to a renewed interest in 
physics at universities across the 
U.S.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Cendrowski also 

discussed why he prefers to keep 
the mood on the set light when he 
directs. 

“We play games all the time. 

We don’t just come in and make it 
the drudgery of work and make it 
like a factory,” he said. “If you’re 
having fun it’s easier to make 
people laugh.” 

Cendrowski spent most of the 

event discussing his role in “The 
Big Bang Theory,” everything 
from the production process to 
tales from the set. These included 
some individual stories about 
working with a few of the leading 
actors. He spoke about his lengthy 
conversations 
with 
Johnny 

Galecki about his character, how 
great he felt when Jim Parsons 
thanked him in his Emmy speech 
and how uplifting it was to watch 
Kaley Cuoco blossom as an actress 
during her eight years on the show 
(she was only 20 when it started). 

One of the highlights of the talk 

was when he touched on some of 
the guest stars that appeared on 
the show. When he mentioned 
working with comedy legend 
Bob Newhart, Cendrowski said, 
“I can’t believe I got to tell him 
what to do.” One of the best was 
the story of what happened when 
Stephen Hawking appeared in 
the season five episode, “The 
Hawking 
Excitation.” 
They 

didn’t know that he would be on 
the show until two days before 
going to Caltech to film the scene. 
Hawking actually did all the 
dialogue himself, using a motion 

sensor in his glasses to speak. He 
also attended a run through two 
days later, where he saw Simon 
Helberg’s character, Howard, 
do an impression of his voice 
(Helberg apologized profusely 
afterward.)

Most 
importantly 
of 
all, 

Cendrowski talked about how 
much he loves working on the 
show. 

“It’s an actual dream for what 

any 
director 
goes 
through,” 

Cendrowski said. “To (be) on 
a hit show that is funny, that 
people still talk about, that wins 
awards, it’s got all the elements. 
And, there’s nice people. There’s 
no prima donnas on the show. 
They have been friends since 
the beginning; they support one 
another; they’re there for one 
another and they’re professional. 
There’s nothing more you can ask 
for.”

In the interview, Cendrowski 

shared why he loves sharing his 
experience with students like he 
did at the Q&A event. 

“To me, it’s so invigorating,” 

Cendrowski said. “I love giving 
back. I love the idea of (it), 
because I was in their seats one 
time myself … I realized there’s 
an appreciative value. I hear it 
from all the teachers saying the 
kids really appreciate it, someone 
from the real world, someone 
from this school that has made 
it. They are hopefully as an 
inspiration from them to do the 
same thing.”

‘Hot Tub’ sequel a 
mindless experience

By LAUREN WOOD

For The Daily

After the success of the first 

“Hot Tub Time Machine,” it’s easy 
to assume that the sequel would 
know just how 
to use its big 
budget 
and 

array of stars to 
come up with 
a 
predictable 

but 
likable 

movie. 
This 

assumption 
would 
be 

wrong.

The 
film 

opens 
by 

showing how far the group has 
come since we’ve last seen them, 
interviewing them on an “E! True 
Hollywood 
Story”-style 
show 

and cleverly skipping over the 
often awkward summary that 
sequels can be bogged down by. 
We learn that the group of friends 
has managed to use their previous 
trip to 1985 for profit and fame, 
with Lou (Rob Corddry, “The 
Daily Show”) creating a number of 
famous inventions, such as Google 
(here called Lougle), Nick (Craig 
Robinson, “The Office”) wrote hit 
songs like “I’ve Got a Feeling,” and 
Adam, (John Cusack, “Being John 
Malkovich”) who is not present in 
this film, apparently on a trip of 
self discovery after he wrote a best 
selling sci-fi novel about a hot tub 
time machine. Only Jacob (Clark 
Duke, “Greek”) is still struggling 
to find his place, acting as a 
butler to Lou in his New Orleans 
mansion. At a party in that 
mansion, Lou is shot (in the dick, 
of course) by a mysterious figure 
in a tuxedo, and the group must 
time travel in to find the killer and 
prevents Lou’s death.

The movie’s start is colorful and 

fast-paced, demonstrating a fresh 
self-awareness. The characters 
are stupid and weird, and the 
actors know this and attempt to 

play to it. But this can only take a 
film so far, and once the inventive 
premise of a group of friends who 
can do whatever they want in a 
hot tub time machine wears off 
(due, in part, to a serious over-
saturation of dick jokes) “Time 
Machine 2” loses any credit its 
few original moments grant it.

The appeal of the charismatic 

cast offers the film some respite 
but not nearly enough to keep its 
audience engaged. At first, Adam 
Scott (“Parks & Rec”) adds some 
much needed innocence to the 
group, but after a few scenes his 
character is overpowered by the 
repetitively crude hive mind, 
and Scott’s sarcastic bite is lost. 
The film does a disastrous job 
navigating the line between brash 
and clever humor that is the basis 
for many R-rated comedies. And 
the jokes themselves are not only 
tiresome in subject matter but 
rehashed ad nauseum.

For a film that relies so heavily 

on mindless humor, the actual plot 
line is unreasonably complicated. 
The group is transported into the 
year 2025, but this is the future 
of an alternate present, and to 
save Lou from being shot in 2015, 
they must find the person who is 
going to later use the hot tub in 
2025 to go back and shoot him for 

something his past self did in the 
future … I think. Even the diagram 
drawn into thin air using the 
impressive futuristic technology 
doesn’t offer enough clarification 
to the storyline, and it’s easy to 
tune out between the tiring jokes 
and complex plot structure.

If I wasn’t already perplexed 

enough by this movie’s unfunny 
treatment 
of 
funny 
jokes, 

repetition of failed ones and 
labyrinthine plot, the ending 
scenes are what really convinced 
me that “Hot Tub Time Machine 
2” has got to be some sort of social 
experiment about our tolerance 
levels for good actors in awful 
movies. With very little lead up, 
the film goes sentimental and 
shifts from 100 percent bro humor 
to a 100 percent unexpected life 
lesson about appreciating others 
and learning to take risks on 
love. Ellie Goulding kicks in out 
of nowhere and there’s a lot of 
solemn, unironic making-out 
between the friends and love 
interests we haven’t seen since 
the opening scenes. Whereas 
the film had been hanging out 
in the realm of worst comedies, 
it jumps dimensions (sans hot 
tub) and decides to inhabit the 
realm of overplayed love stories 
as well.

PARAMOUNT

V-necks deepen but the plot doesn’t.

Rosie O’Donnell’s special 
is ‘Heartfelt,’ personal

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

The phrase “comic relief” has 

never carried more weight than it 
does in Rosie O’Donnell’s recent 
HBO 
Docu-

mentary, 
“A 

Heartfelt Stand 
Up.” 
Gracing 

the 
spotlight-

ed 
stage 
for 

the first time 
in 
20 
years, 

O’Donnell 
(“The 
View”) 

has a new pur-
pose 
for 
her 

comedy: 
to 

inform women 
about the signs 
and symptoms 
of heart attacks, drawing from her 
own nearly fatal attack in 2012. 

Taking the medical statis-

tics into account, 52-year-old 
O’Donnell shouldn’t have sur-
vived. She recounts that on a hot 
mid-August day in New Jersey, 
O’Donnell assisted an overweight 
woman out of her car and soon 
afterwards felt searing pain in her 
upper arms. Dismissing the pain to 
overexertion, she brushed it off — 
until her state worsened. Her skin 
scorched “hotter than I ever felt 
during menopause,” her muscles 
ached with overwhelming exhaus-
tion, her reflection was a clammy 
ghost and nausea made it impos-
sible to stomach anything that her 
then-wife, Michelle Rounds, gave 
her. Yet like many women before 
her, O’Donnell refused to call 911 
on the grounds that she didn’t 
want to cause a scene or snatch 
the emergency vehicles away from 
someone who “really” needed 
them. 

So she popped some aspirin 

(which ultimately saved her life) 
and stayed home, waiting over 50 
hours until finally checking into 
the E.R. At that point, O’Donnell 
had 100 percent blockage in her 

left descending artery (nicknamed 
“the widow maker” of coronary 
disease) — and she had lived a 
whopping 40 hours longer than 
any patient had before. 

“I didn’t know I had a heart 

attack, and I thought maybe the 
reason I didn’t die was because 
I have a public voice and I can 
share the facts with everybody,” 
O’Donnell reflects in “Heartfelt.” 
In the aftermath of her heart 
attack, 
the 
infamously 
brash 

banterer had a sort of humbling 
revelation — though she had a 
demanding lifestyle, a strained 
relationship with her wife and 
children as well as a genetic history 
of cancer, she survived. To spread 
the word, O’Donnell decided to 
do what she does best — standup 
comedy. Only this time with a very 
real, very serious undertone.

The question is, should these 

tasks be combined? Can a stand up 
act really be heartfelt? The fact is, 
comedians love to joke about death 
and near-death experiences. Dark 
comedy makes the audience just 
uncomfortable enough to make it 
a relief to laugh, knowing it’s all 
a hoax — like when Betty White 
played the grandmother in “The 
Proposal” who faked her death to 
expedite her grandson’s wedding. 
As cynical as it sounds, death can 
be funny if it’s not personal.

For O’Donnell, however, it is 

personal. In her hour-long stand-

up act, the comedienne wears 
her heart on her sleeve — no pun 
intended — as she talks about 
the struggles of raising five chil-
dren (she had the fifth, a toddler, 
“Because I have four teenagers”), 
the excitement of falling in love 
again with Rounds (who proved 
that “lipstick lesbians” actually 
do exist), as well as her ongoing 
obsession with Barbra Streisand. 
Though O’Donnell is known for 
her abrasive opinions and knee-
jerk comebacks, she somehow 
becomes more human under the 
spotlight, her eyes watery with 
memories of her children when 
they were “delicious” babies. This 
doting mother act quickly snaps 
back to farce, though, with a long 
rant about circumcision. 

Somewhere between explod-

ing about her eldest teenager’s 
sex life and remembering the 
ups-and-downs of her whirlwind 
romance, O’Donnell finds her 
somber purpose in the act’s final 
20 minutes. Though she tries to 
balance the severity of the issue 
with her trademark sarcasm, there 
is something off about her story. 
Because on a stand-up stage, it’s 
hard to tell farce from reality. 
Death becomes the joke and the 
joke becomes death, blurring the 
lines of where to laugh and when 
to listen. Comic relief certainly 
lightens the issue — but should 
heart disease be taken lightly?

Beilein’s offense stifles 
Ohio State’s defense in 
rematch of lopsided loss

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

It didn’t take even 90 seconds for the 

Michigan men’s basketball team to make 
a statement about how Sunday’s game 
against Ohio State was going to go.

Sophomore forward Zak Irvin stood at 

the top of the key on the Wolverines’ sec-
ond possession, guarded by Ohio State 
freshman D’Angelo Russell.

Freshman forward Ricky Doyle came 

to the top of the key to set a screen and 
stopped Russell cold. Irvin coasted to the 
basket for a layup.

Only a month ago, the Buckeyes and 

their high-pressure defense flummoxed 
a young Michigan team into coughing 

up 13 turnovers and shooting 34 percent. 
Sunday at Crisler Center, an even young-
er Michigan team never gave them the 
chance to do the same thing.

The Wolverines gained a step using 

their pick-and-roll, opened things up on 
the perimeter with screens and whipped 
the ball around to their playmakers when 
they found the space.

“We practiced handling the pressure,” 

said senior forward Max Bielfeldt. “Ohio 
State’s a great pressure team. We prac-
ticed that all week. It was not that pretty 
in practice. We were struggling a little 
bit with it, and today we really kind of 
clicked on all cylinders.”

Michigan coach John Beilein has talk-

ed throughout the Big Ten season about 
needing better passing on his team — 
so much so that he had 5-foot-11 junior 
point guard Spike Albrecht passing the 
ball inbounds against Illinois center 
Nnanna Egwu in the final seconds of his 
team’s game Feb. 12.

Michigan storms out of 

gates, upsets Ohio State to 
snap five-game losing skid

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

It wasn’t the start anybody expected for 

the Michigan men’s basketball team Sun-
day against No. 24 Ohio State, and not just 
because of Big Sean.

The popular Detroit-based rapper capti-

vated the crowd at Crisler Center before the 
game, guest-starring on the public-address 
system as he introduced the Wolverines’ 
starting lineup.

But the Big Sean buzz was short-lived, as 

Michigan quickly recaptured the attention 
of its home crowd with a 7-0 run to start the 
game. The Wolverines — viewed as heavy 
underdogs — quickly expanded that lead to 
17-7.

Michigan (7-8 Big Ten, 14-13 overall) 

played arguably its best 20-minute stretch 
of the Big Ten season in the first half, rid-
ing a 39-23 halftime lead all the way to a 
64-57 victory. All cylinders were firing for 
the Wolverines — seven players contributed 
scoring in the period, including sophomore 
guard Andrew Dakich’s first points of the 
season. He hit a 3-pointer from the corner 
that brought the Crisler crowd to its feet, one 
of several standing ovations the Wolverines 
received throughout the dominant opening 
sequence.

“Honestly, I was just relieved,” Dakich 

said. “I haven’t been playing the way I think 
I can sometimes, and to finally hit that first 
shot … I couldn’t stop smiling, because I’ve 
waited for this moment my whole life. And to 
do it against a really good Ohio State is pretty 
cool.”

Freshman forward Kameron Chatman, 

too, displayed moves Michigan fans have 
been waiting to see all season, scoring off a 
sharp spin move early in the half and earn-
ing a layup after taking the ball from coast to 
coast for a few minutes later.

“Kam continues to make progress,” Beilein 

said. “Where some people may be dialing 
back in their practice right now, we’re actu-
ally practicing more with those guys, because 
they need this fundamental work … with 
Kam, it certainly showed off today.”

The house Michigan lacrosse built

T

he Michigan men’s 
lacrosse team is about 
to play the No. 2 team in 

the country, 
and for pos-
sibly the first 
time in its 
short history, 
it doesn’t feel 
like it’ll be a 
blowout.

The 

crowd files 
in early to 
Oosterbaan 
Field House, 
and for the first time in this 
program’s short history, they 
are turning away fans at the 
door. There are still 20 minutes 
before the game begins.

Dads stand in packs, arms 

crossed, previewing the match, 
while moms sit together on the 
bleachers. Kids from all over 
come to watch, some needing to 
be hoisted up on shoulders for 
a glimpse, for a chance to see 
the game. They pack the cor-
ners and the sidelines, and for 
a moment, it seems there might 
be more fans in attendance than 
the end of the football team’s 
game against Utah.

They announce teams, and 

now, for one of the rare times, 
Michigan’s starters are juniors 
and seniors. The Wolverines 
have players who have grown 
into their roles, who aren’t just 
learning them.

Before the first faceoff 

against Notre Dame, Michigan 
is 2-0 to begin the season. It’s 
the first time in the program’s 
history. And for the program 
that endured 37 losses in its first 
three years, Saturday’s game 
feels different — everything 
feels different.

***

F

or the past three years 
the Wolverines have 
started each afternoon in 

the weight room above Canham 
Natatorium. They lift for part 
of the day, then walk across 
the track at Ferry Field to their 
locker room at Ray Fisher Sta-
dium. Some days, they go to 
the Academic Center to watch 
film. Then they change and run 
around the baseball and softball 
fields to practice in Oosterbaan.

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team doesn’t have a home on 
campus. It shares space and 
makes do with what’s available.

The team is lucky just to 

have a place to lift, practice and 
watch film.

When the Wolverines were a 

club team, they didn’t have the 
same luxuries. So players and 
coaches haven’t complained 
about their facilities now — it’s 
better than what they had.

Legitimacy isn’t just given 

after complaining and begging. 
It’s earned. And it has a chance 
to earn it is against Notre 
Dame.

***

T

he first quarter begins 
with Notre Dame’s 
Logan Connolly barrel-

ing over players into a penalty. 
The Fighting Irish are the No. 
2 team in the country. They’re 
bigger, faster and, most impor-
tantly, they’re a program with 
many more years of experience 
than the Wolverines.

Michigan takes each hit, 

each stick check and finds a 
way to work through it. It has 
faced tough teams in the past, 
but rarely does it face a team as 
good as the Fighting Irish, who 
fell to Duke in the national title 
game last season.

Sophomore goalie Gerald 

Logan makes a save at point-
blank range, and the crowd 
erupts. He finds an outlet, and 
Michigan rushes down the field. 
It runs its offense quickly until 
a shot goes wide.

The Wolverines trail 2-1 at 

the end of the first quarter and 
somehow, it feels as if Michigan 
is still able to win the game.

***

B

uilding the Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team is 
like building a house.

Coach John Paul tells his 

team that it is building each 
part of the house with every 
week. He’s built the founda-
tion, as he says, if he can be so 
humble as to say he built the 
foundation. Really, he had to cut 
down the trees, level the land 
and build the road to get there, 
given how this team started.

The head coach of the club 

varsity lacrosse team — essen-
tially one step below varsity sta-
tus — Paul and the Wolverines 
were granted varsity status in 
late May 2011. They began prac-
tice for their first season the 
same year.

Paul never had time to 

recruit his first class to come 
play, instead using the club 
players who had come to 
Michigan for academic rea-
sons. Unlike the women’s team, 
which was given a year to build, 
Paul was thrown into the fire.

“There were a lot of culture 

changes we had to go through,” 
Paul said. “We anticipated this 
would take a while, but we 
wanted to do it the right way 
and build culture first.

“If you’d ask the guys, years 

ago, to give you an honest 
answer (about buying into the 
culture), I don’t know if that 
was the case.”

But over time, Paul has 

brought in bigger, better 
recruiting classes. Now, as 
he says, this year is different 
because they have the “frame” 
in place. You can see the house 
being built, and now, you can 
see the tangible successes after 
double-digit-loss seasons.

“You do so much work from a 

distance that it doesn’t look like 
you’re making any progress,” 
Paul said.

***

T

he second quarter, and 
really the remainder 
of the game, unraveled 

from underneath Michigan. 
Paul described his team as 
“emotional” afterward; unable 
to stay upbeat when it was 
knocked down.

Notre Dame outscored the 

Wolverines 7-1 in the second 
quarter, forcing five turnovers 
with a defense that flustered 
the Wolverines. The Fighting 
Irish offense pushed the ball 
inside to create easy scoring 
opportunities.

“I think, more than anything, 

they were disappointed in the 
way they were playing,” Paul 
said. “Our guys certainly feel 
like they could be a lot better 
than they were. And that’s what 
we want.”

This used to be a team that 

slowed down the pace of play 
so that it could limit a game 
getting out of hand, and it 
dropped players back faster to 
make sure its defense wasn’t 
exposed. And now, it’s playing 
the faster up-tempo game it 
always wanted.

“We showed what we’re 

capable of doing, and I think 
that’s a big step,” said senior 
attacker Will Meter.

The Wolverines were silent 

heading off the field after the 
final horn, because this game 
stung. But in a different way 
than it used to.

***

T

he season ahead is filled 
with even more ranked 
teams, and the ones that 

aren’t have already built their 
houses.

But this year is different 

because by now, they’ve been 
through a gauntlet schedule like 
this before.

“If we’re going to get where 

we want to get with this pro-

gram, at some point it’s got to 
stop being intimidating,” Paul 
said. “In the first three years, 
we’d approach games like this 
and say, ‘Man, I hope we can 
hang with these guys.’ And I 
don’t think that’s the case any-
more.”

But this year is different, not 

because a boy sits on his dad’s 
shoulders to watch or because 
players are older. It feels dif-
ferent because, going to any 
game, it feels as if Michigan 
has a chance. And this team 
likely won’t be in line for some 
miraculous season, but it has its 
foundation and its frame.

“We’ve turned a corner, 

and it’s visible when you see 
us every day now,” Paul said. 
“We’re a very different pro-
gram.”

That much has never been 

truer. Because a good house 
stays standing, even after it 
loses.

Sunday, the Wolverines’ pass-

ing was crisp and quick, never 
allowing Ohio State to set up its 
defense. The Buckeyes didn’t 
go to their zone until just three 
minutes remained in the first 
half, 
when 
Michigan 
found 

Doyle for an easy layup under 
the basket. And they didn’t go 
to their full-court press until 
90 seconds into the second half, 
when Albrecht and Bielfeldt 
connected on a quick give-and-
go to get Albrecht down the 
court safely.

By that time, the Wolverines 

led by double digits and had set-
tled into a rhythm offensively. It 
was too late.

“We struggled against their 

press and how they guarded us 
in the first game when we played 
in Columbus,” Irvin said. “I just 
thought we’d be able to watch 

film and be able to counter that 
this afternoon.”

Added Ohio State coach Thad 

Matta: “It seemed like we were 
on our heels too much defen-
sively. Give them credit. They 
were able to do, especially in 
the first half, 
anything 
they 
wanted 

to do against 
us. You can’t 
do that with 
that type of 
offense.”

When 
the 

going 
got 

tough, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
composure 
never wavered. They, not Ohio 
State, looked like the team with 
three seniors in its rotation. 
In the end, Albrecht and Irvin 
roared with delight after finally 
finishing off a win in February 
on their sixth try.

“It was just a lot of frustra-

tion let out in the last couple 
minutes,” Albrecht said. “We’ve 
had a tough stretch here these 
past five games, so to be able 
to finally get a win, it was awe-
some.”

Michigan 
used 
a 
classic 

Beilein offen-
sive 
game 

to 
generate 

all 
kinds 
of 

opportunities. 
After 
Doyle’s 

screen on Rus-
sell in the first 
two 
minutes, 

he leaked out 
from the paint 
and 
drained 

an open base-

line jumper. A moment later, 
freshman guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman drove down 
the baseline and kicked out to an 
open Irvin for a 3-pointer.

That passing continued for 

most of the first half as the Wol-
verines built their lead, bringing 

to mind some of their perfor-
mances of the past two years.

“We had 13 assists. We haven’t 

had 13 assists in a long time (only 
once since Jan. 6),” Beilein said. 
“I know that’s a stat a lot of you 
don’t value probably as much as 
I do, but it means you made two 
people guard you and you got 
somebody open.”

In the last seven minutes, 

Ohio State had a 20-point defi-
cit trimmed down to three after 
blocking a shot near the end of 
the shot clock and scoring at the 
other end.

But the Wolverines’ motion 

on offense worked to perfection 
again, giving Irvin an open tri-
ple from the corner.

Then it was just a matter of 

Michigan making the plays it 
hasn’t all month. This time, the 
Wolverines put themselves in 
position to finish the game.

“I wasn’t going to let us lose 

that game,” Albrecht said. “I did 
not want to lose that game.”

The Wolverines’ lead bal-

looned to as many as 20 points 
in the first half before Ohio State 
whittled it to three in the sec-
ond. But Michigan has struggled 
to hold late leads and close out 
tight games in recent weeks, most 
notably in overtime losses to 
Michigan State and Illinois.

That wasn’t the issue on Jan. 

13, when the Wolverines were, 
by and large, run out of the gym 
against the Buckeyes’ 71-52 Ohio 
State victory.

The Wolverines were deter-

mined to flip both narratives 
on their heads in their rematch 
with the Buckeyes (8-6, 19-8). 
Albrecht, Irvin and senior for-
ward Max Bielfeldt, especially, 
made sure Michigan didn’t suc-
cumb to its late-game malaise of 
weeks past. Irvin made a critical 
layup following a steal by fresh-
man guard Aubrey Dawkins with 
1:01 left in the game, and Albrecht 
drained an equally important 
pair of free throws with 55 sec-
onds left to push Michigan’s lead 
to 60-50 and eventually seal the 
Wolverines’ victory.

“I don’t think it was as much 

relief as it was just excitement,” 
Bielfeldt said of finally getting 

over the hump. “We hadn’t had 
a good win like that in a while. 
It reminded me a little bit of the 
day where we had those big wins 
more often.”

Albrecht 
finished 
with 
16 

points, five assists and four 
rebounds. Irvin, who has strug-
gled periodically throughout the 
season, put together a complete 
game Sunday, finishing with 15 
points, seven rebounds and four 

assists.

Freshman 
guard 
Muham-

mad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman was 
impressive early as well, breaking 
through the Buckeyes’ front line 
multiple times. The penetration 
left sophomore forward Zak Irvin 
and junior guard Spike Albrecht 
with open looks at 3-pointers on 
multiple occasions — the pair col-
lectively shot 4-for-7 from beyond 
the arc in the first half.

Sunday’s win, Beilein said, was 

a case study in playing college 
basketball the right way.

“I told our freshmen today, 

‘Watch Spike Albrecht.’ That’s 
what college basketball is gravi-
tating to,” Beilein said. “Diving on 
the floor, playing at high speed, 
playing so hard that you can’t 
breathe sometimes — that is what 
the great players do, and we’re 
learning that.”

Michigan upset bid 
falls short vs. Irish

By TAHMEED TUREEN

For the Daily 

Fans walked into Oosterbaan 

Field House hoping to get a 
glimpse of the Michigan men’s 
lacrosse 
team’s 
match 
against No. 
2 Notre Dame. But not all fans 
were able to watch the game 
firsthand, as the game sold out, 
resulting in fans being turned 
away.

But the Fighting Irish made 

sure those who couldn’t get 
in didn’t miss a major upset, 
topping Michigan 17-8.

The game started off with 

both teams fighting for ground 
balls and goals. Sophomore 
attackman Ian King started off 
the scoring with 9:38 left in the 
first quarter, while sophomore 
goalie Gerald Logan backed 
up the team with six saves. 
Notre Dame (2-0) responded 
with just two goals to end the 
first quarter. The atmosphere 
promised a thrilling game for 
both fan bases.

However, 
the 
momentum 

changed when the Fighting 
Irish began to dominate from 
the X with consecutive face-
off wins. With much more 
possession than the Wolverines, 
the Fighting Irish netted seven 
goals in the second quarter 
while Michigan was only able 
to score once from the stick of 
senior attackman Mike Francia. 
The seven Irish goals came from 
six different players.

Michigan’s 
second-quarter 

offense wasn’t able to settle 
down due to constant pressure 
from the Fighting Irish defense, 
as they also kept the Michigan 
offense from entering into their 
territory.

The transition game was 

key during this game, which 
ultimately gave the Fighting 
Irish the upper hand until the 
final whistle.

“(Notre Dame is) a very 

strong transition (team) with 

big shooters and nifty inside 
attackmen,” 
said 
freshman 

midfielder 
Parker 
McKee. 

“They definitely, definitely got 
their chances (off transitions).”

The 
third 
and 
fourth 

quarters were a much better 
representation of the game 
in comparison to the second 
quarter. Notre Dame was held 
to eight goals by the Michigan 
defense 
while 
the 
offense 

rattled the Irish net six times. 
King scored his third tally 
with 9:37 left in the third 
quarter, and junior midfielder 
Mike Hernandez and senior 
midfielder Will Meter followed 
King with a goal apiece.

However, 
Notre 
Dame 

outscored the Wolverines once 
again, scoring five unanswered 
goals to pull ahead 17-6. Meter 
would tally one more goal, and 
King added another with 23 
seconds left in the game.

King had a total of four goals 

and two assists while Logan 
had 16 saves between the pipes. 
Hernandez also scored his first 
goal of the season in the second 
half.

On the other side of the field, 

Matt Kavanaugh, known as the 
face of the Irish attack, scored 
three goals and three assists. 
Brother Rice (Michigan) High 
School graduate Sergio Perkovic 
also scored two goals in his 
return to his home state.

While it was a tough loss 

for the fourth-year program, 
Michigan 
can 
take 
some 

positives from the experience 
going forward. The Wolverines 
still have to face lacrosse 
powerhouses Johns Hopkins 
and Maryland during Big Ten 
play.

“Thankfully, we have a game 

like this to prepare before we get 
into the Big Ten,” said Michigan 
coach John Paul. “I’m really glad 
we scheduled this game.”

But the season goes on for 

the Wolverines, and they’ll 
have to move past the tough 
loss, especially with Canisius 
coming to town in a week.

‘M’ crashes party at Bama

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

In the seventh inning of the 

No. 5 Michigan softball team’s 
first of two games against No. 3 
Alabama, SEC Network analyst 
and former Crimson Tide pitcher 
Lauren Sewell was in awe. As 
she watched her alma mater 
continue to be outplayed, she 
said, “I thought Michigan would 
be intimidated by Alabama.”

The subsequent pitch was 

sent over the center field wall 
by Michigan junior right fielder 
Kelsey Susalla, the eventual MVP 
of the Easton Bama Bash.

It was Alabama that was 

intimidated, and the Crimson 
Tide’s fans at Rhoads Stadium 
went silent.

The Wolverines went on to 

win the game, 8-2, the second of 
their five wins in an undefeated 
weekend.

Michigan (13-1) started the 

tournament with a 7-1 win over 
Lipscomb. Michigan tried not to 
look ahead, taking the Bison just 
as seriously as Alabama.

“We 
just 
play 
Michigan 

softball, and it doesn’t matter 
who we’re going against,” said 
sophomore pitcher Megan Betsa.

In a matchup between two top-

five teams, Michigan approached 
Alabama the exact same way as 
usual: focusing on each pitch and 
taking it one inning at a time.

“We talked about not making 

the game bigger than it is,” said 
junior infielder Sierra Romero.

Senior catcher Lauren Sweet 

scored 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 

runs with a two-run homer in 
the second inning. Later in the 
frame, the bases were loaded and 
the table was set for Michigan 
to break the game wide open. 
But sophomore left fielder Kelly 
Christiner eventually struck out 
after putting up a fight.

“At first when we had the 

bases loaded and nobody out, 
our swings were just huge,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“But then we shortened up a 

little bit and made contact. I liked 
that adjustment. I like that we’re 
willing to do whatever it takes to 
win.”

After shortening up their 

swings, the Wolverines pulled 
away little by little, making 
Alabama 
fans 
increasingly 

frustrated. As the fans pleaded 
with the umpire for calls to go 
in the Crimson Tide’s favor, the 
once-upbeat body language of 
the Alabama players started to 
deteriorate.

Instead of feeling intimated, 

Michigan was relaxed. Betsa, 
who got the win, was happy with 
how the team balanced being 
intense and energetic. And the 
offensive dominance helped her 
cause, as she held the Crimson 
Tide to two runs.

“When they’re putting that 

many runs on the board, it makes 
it a lot easier for us (pitchers) 
and gives us that comfort,” Betsa 
said.

The barrage of runs didn’t stop 

coming as the tournament went 
into day two. The Wolverines 
racked 
up 
13 
runs 
against 

Lipscomb, not showing any signs 
of letting up. Senior pitcher Sara 

Driesenga pitched a complete 
game while holding the Bisons to 
only one run.

Senior pitcher Haylie Wagner 

took the circle for Michigan for 
the rematch against Alabama 
and stifled the Crimson Tide to 
a one-run effort. The Wolverines 
faced Alexis Osorio, who pitched 
a no-hitter in her previous game 
against Pacific. And they didn’t 
let Osorio get anywhere close to 
the success of her last start.

Osorio was ineffective, as 

Michigan never trailed after 
building on a 1-0 lead in the third 
inning to the tune of a solo home 
run by Christiner and a two-
run homer from freshman Tera 
Blanco. The Wolverines held on 
the rest of the way to win 4-1.

“I don’t ever expect anything 

but we chip away,” Hutchins said. 
“We chip away, and it isn’t just 
one, two or three people in our 
lineup. It’s everybody. It’s every 
part of the order that can turn 
things around. Our goal is just to 
keep chipping away and putting 
the ball in play.”

The Wolverines finished the 

weekend on day three with a 
10-0 run-rule win against James 

Madison.

“We never backed down,” 

Romero said. “Every single at 
bat, every single play, every single 
pitch, we were fighting. We were 
never satisfied with the lead we 
had, and we kept pushing for 
more.”

With a grand slam in the 

final game, Romero broke the 
Michigan 
career 
grand-slam 

record with eight. But she said 
that the record was never her 
goal.

“My goal is to do my part,” 

Romero said. “As long as I’m 
doing my part and everyone else 
is doing their part, then we’re 
going to be a very hard team to 
beat.”

After the Wolverines outscored 

their opponents 42-5 over the 
weekend, bolstered by 10 home 
runs, everyone in the lineup, top 
to bottom, is contributing.

Michigan isn’t intimidated. 

It has shown the rest of the 
country that no matter who the 
Wolverines play, they’re going to 
play like a force to be reckoned 
with. If anything, they’re the 
ones who are able to intimidate 
opponents.

Junior shortstop Sierra Romero went 6-for-11 on the weekend and broke the school record for grand slams with eight.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan loses in 
double overtime

Michigan beats 

buzzer to force OT, 

can’t finish rally

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

Maybe 
it 
just 
isn’t 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s season.

Just 

a 
week 

after 
the 

Wolverines 
lost to Northwestern on a last-
second layup, Michigan found 
itself down by two with less than 
five seconds in the game and one 
final chance to tie up the game.

The 
sequence 
started 
off 

poorly with sophomore guard 
Siera 
Thompson 
missing 
an 

off-balanced jumper, but in the 
ensuing scramble for the ball, 
senior forward Cyesha Goree 
picked up the ball and threw up 
another shot.

The shot rattled around the 

rim and out, right into the arms 
of senior forward Nicole Elmblad, 
who was all alone on the weak side. 
Elmblad’s layup went through the 
bucket as time expired.

In overtime, the Wolverines 

found themselves down once 
again, this time by four with 
a minute remaining. But once 
again, Michigan came back, 
with Goree first knocking down 
a mid-range jumper to cut the 
deficit to two. On the ensuing 
play, freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty picked the ball away 
from Minnesota center Amanda 
Zahui B., and Elmblad came up 
clutch, knocking down a jump 
shot to tie the game and send it 
into double overtime.

In 
double 
overtime, 
the 

Wolverines fell down by six with 
a minute remaining, ultimately 
losing the game.

“I 
thought 
we 
gave 
it 

tremendous 
effort,” 
said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I really thought our 
press disrupted them. We made 
a tremendous run. It’s tough 
because we’ve been this situation 
so many times during the course 
of this season. It’d be nice for 
once for it to go our way.”

The matchup to watch in the 

game was Goree and Zahui, and 
the duo didn’t disappoint.

The two battled each other 

inside, each playing all 50 minutes 
while putting up double-double 
numbers. Zahui, who put up 39 
points and grabbed 29 boards 
Tuesday, racked up 27 points and 
27 rebounds while Goree finished 
with 26 points and 20 rebounds.

“I thought it was a great 

basketball game,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Cyesha Goree and Amanda 
Zahui B., two of the best posts in 
the country, went head to head, 
and it was a great matchup.”

But Goree wasn’t Michigan’s 

leading scorer, as that title went 
to Flaherty, who finished with 27 
points, shooting 11-for-25.

“Down the stretch, we were 

putting the ball in (Flaherty’s) 
hands,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 

“She’s making some plays. I 
think she’s getting more and 
more comfortable as the season 
progresses. She just had a great 
output tonight.”

With the loss, the Wolverines 

have all but clinched the No. 8 
seed in the Big Ten Tournament, 
which will get them a first-round 
bye, before taking on the No. 9 
seed in the second. The winner 
of that game will take on No. 5 
Maryland, the Big Ten champion, 
in the third round.

But before then, Michigan still 

has two games left in the season.

And with the result today, 

another loss could knock them 
out of the NCAA Tournament 
picture for good.

‘M’ can’t capitalize on 
series-opening victory

By DANNY VARGOVICK 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

entered play this weekend eager 
to forget a tough season-opening 
series loss to Long Beach State. 
But after two games this weekend 
against Tennessee Tech and two 
against Davidson, things only got 
worse.

Friday, in Savannah, Georgia, 

the Wolverines collected their 
sole win over the Golden Eagles, 
6-5, before dropping the final 
three games of the weekend to 
Davidson, 5-4, Tennessee Tech, 
11-8, and Davidson, 3-2.

The highlight of the weekend 

for Michigan (2-5) came in the 
ninth inning of the first game 
against Tennessee Tech, when 
junior left fielder Cody Bruder 
laid down the go-ahead RBI bunt 
single. Bruder reached first safely 
even though Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich called for a suicide 
squeeze.

“Cody did a great job executing 

in that situation,” Bakich said. 
“That was a game-winning play 
right there.”

Junior closer and first baseman 

Jacob Cronenworth earned the 
win after pitching the final two 
innings. Cronenworth also led 
off and reached base three times, 
as did the No. 2 and No. 3 hitters, 
Bruder and senior center fielder 
Jackson Glines.

But after the win, the final 

three games of the weekend left 
Bakich with little to praise.

The second game got off to a 

great start thanks in a large part 
to a five-inning, seven-strikeout, 
no-run 
performance 
from 

sophomore right hander Keith 
Lehmann. Bakich was unhappy, 
though, that he needed to pull 
Lehmann after the fifth inning, 
since 
the 
right-hander 
had 

already thrown 96 pitches.

“The type of pitcher Keith is,” 

Bakich said, “I’d rather him force 
contact and pitch deeper into 
games than have to accumulate 

pitches because he’s striking 
people out.”

The Wolverines went into 

the top of the ninth leading 3-0. 
With Cronenworth unavailable 
after throwing two innings the 
previous day, Davidson (3-2) sent 
the game to extra innings largely 
due to Wolverine mistakes: Two 
of the three runs that scored in 
the ninth reached base on a walk 
and hit-by-pitch, both of which 
ultimately scored off a wild pitch 
and passed ball.

The 
11th 

inning 
began 

just 
like 
the 

ninth — with 
a 
walk 
and 

a 
hit 
batter. 

Davidson went 
up 
for 
good 

when 
both 

runners scored 
on a fielder’s 
choice.

Saturday’s second game, the 

final contest against Tennessee 
Tech 
(4-2), 
featured 
better 

hitting, worse pitching and fatal 
errors.

The Golden Eagles put up 

six unearned runs in the third 
inning off of a number of walks 
and errors by Cronenworth and 
senior shortstop Eric Jacobson.

Michigan’s 
noteworthy 

moment came in the form 
of 
a 
three-run 
home 
run 

by 
sophomore 
designated 

hitter Carmen Benedetti, the 
Wolverines’ first home run of the 
season. The team cut the lead to 
just two runs in the seventh, but 
Tennessee Tech put the game 
out of reach in the eighth in a 
frustratingly familiar fashion: 
Of the three runners that scored 
in the inning, two had originally 
reached base off a walk and a hit 
batter.

Michigan’s final game of the 

weekend, a 9 a.m. start against 
Davidson, was much more of a 
pitchers’ duel.

Freshman 
Jayce 
Vancena 

impressed in his first collegiate 

start, limiting the Wildcats to 
one run on four hits and no walks. 
Benedetti then came in for his 
first appearance on the mound in 
his college career and threw one 
and two-thirds innings of no-hit 
ball.

The Wolverines held a two-run 

lead in the bottom of the eighth 
when Wildcat David Daniels hit 
a two-run bomb off of sophomore 
lefthander Brett Adcock.

Junior 
shortstop 
Travis 

Maezes was unable to play after 

being 
ruled 

out with an 
injury, 
so 

Jacobson 
shifted 
over 

from 
second 

base 
in 
his 

absence.

“(Jacobson) 

is 
a 
high-

character, 
high-makeup 

kid, and defense has always been 
one of his greatest strengths,” 
Bakich said. “He’s made all the 
routine plays for us that we’ve 
needed him to made and done a 
really nice job leading the infield 
from the shortstop position.”

After the Wolverines were 

originally scheduled to travel to 
Greenville, North Carolina, they 
had to make alternative plans due 
to weather.

 They didn’t find out who they 

would be playing until Thursday 
night, limiting the amount of 
time they had to prepare for the 
weekend. But Bakich refused 
to use this as a possible excuse 
and also rejected the idea that 
the team was at a disadvantage 
because 
its 
opponents 
can 

practice 
outside 
while 
the 

Wolverines cannot in the middle 
of the Ann Arbor winter.

He’s not taking these losses 

lightly, either.

“We’ve got to get better in a lot 

of areas, as an entire team unit, 
pitching, hitting, and defense,” 
Bakich said. “There’s a massive 
sense of urgency.”

“We’ve got to get 
better ... There’s 
a massive sense 

of urgency.”

Michigan upsets Memphis

By ALEX KHALIFEH

For the Daily 

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team 
showed 
an 
underdog 

mentality Saturday at the Varsity 
Tennis Center. Going toe to 
toe with No. 22 Memphis, the 
Wolverines came from behind 
in both doubles and singles 
competition en route to their 5-1 
victory.

In 
doubles 
play, 
redshirt 

freshman 
Alex 
Knight 
and 

freshman Leo Hua faced an early 
deficit in their matchup against 
Memphis’ Andrew Watson and 
Louis Asser.

For most of the match, Watson 

and Asser used the both-up 
strategy, playing close to the net 
and rarely showing any defensive 
mishaps. Knight and Hua tried 
painting the lines, but eventually 
lost, 6-3.

Senior No. 1 doubles partners 

Alex Petrone and Michael Zhu 
fell behind, 3-1, in their first set 
against the Tigers’ Kai Lemke 
and Connor Glennon.

But Petrone and Zhu were able 

to recover — partly due to two 
straight double faults by Lemke 
and Glennon — and tie the match 
at 3.

After a back-and-forth match, 

Memphis (4-3) seemed ready 
to pull away in the tiebreaker 
with a 4-0 lead in the third set. 
But Petrone and Zhu came back, 
taking a 5-4 advantage and 

ultimately winning the match, 
7-6. The win gave the Wolverines 
a 1-0 lead.

“Unbelievable,” said Michigan 

coach Adam Steinberg. “That was 
the most important part of the 
match. We’ve been struggling in 
doubles. It was incredible.”

Zhu was the standout player on 

Steinberg’s mind after the game.

“He’s 
really 
stepping 
up, 

playing aggressive and playing 
like a senior,” Steinberg said. 
“Today, he’s our hero. He was 
fantastic.”

The momentum from Petrone 

and 
Zhu’s 
decisive 
doubles 

match carried over to the singles 
matchups, where Michigan (3-5) 
went up early against Memphis, 
leading four out of the six singles 
matchups.

After 
losing 
his 
singles 

matchup earlier Saturday against 
Cleveland State’s Jorg Van Der 
Vloet, Knight bounced back, 
defeating 
Memphis’ 
Patrick 

Mayer, 6-3, 6-2.

Freshman Carter Lin faced 

problems in his first set against 
Memphis’ Shakeel Manji, losing 
the first set, 6-3. During the break 
in action, Steinberg offered the 
rookie advice.

“Carter needs to play more 

aggressively,” 
Steinberg 
said. 

“He shies away from stepping 
in. We were trying to attack his 
opponent for him. There were 
a lot of short balls that Carter 
needs to get on.”

Manji had an opportunity to 

tie the match at five after building 
a 40-30 lead over Lin, but Lin 
recovered and put the match to 
rest by winning the next two 
points.

The advice seemed to resonate 

with Lin, who went on to sweep 
the next two sets, 6-3, 6-4.

Crocker 
played 
a 
tightly 

contested 
match 
against 

Memphis’ Lemke, where Crocker 
took the first set decisively, 
winning 6-2, but allowed the 
second and third to be decided in 
tiebreakers.

The second and third sets 

saw Crocker commit two double 
faults that either propelled the 
match into a tiebreak or gave 
Lemke an advantage.

The tiebreaker in the third 

showcased another comeback 
performance.

When Crocker had been down 

4-0 in the tiebreaker, Steinberg 
reminded him of Petrone and 
Zhu, who came back from down 
4-0 in their doubles tiebreaker.

Crocker bounced back and 

took a 5-4 lead. The tiebreaker 
lasted a total of 20 points, with 
Crocker eventually winning, 11-9.

“I wanted to win to top off 

the great effort by the team. Our 
seniors and our coaches kept us 
focused on what we needed to 
do,” Crocker said.

The preparation paid off with 

a well earned victory over a 
nationally ranked opponent.

SPLIT DECISION

Michigan splits 
with Ohio State, 
moves into first 
place in Big Ten

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

It’s been the Hyman and 

Larkin show for quite a while 
now, and the show will go on.

Senior forward Zach Hyman 

and freshman forward Dylan 
Larkin each netted a goal and 
recorded three assists in Sunday’s 
5-2 victory over Ohio State as the 
No. 15 Michigan hockey team 
moved into a first-place tie with 
Minnesota atop the Big Ten 
standings.

“We’ve been together since the 

start of the year, so every game 
we’ve gotten better,” Hyman said. 
“We’re good friends off the ice, 
so there’s chemistry there, and it 
just carries over onto the ice.”

The win comes two days after 

the Wolverines’ 10-game unbeaten 
streak over the Buckeyes, dating 
back to 2011, was snapped in 
Columbus. 
Michigan 
coach 

Red Berenson cited a lackluster 
defensive effort as the root of his 
team’s 
mediocre 
performance 

Friday, but all that was cleaned 
up for the final meeting of the 
season between the Wolverines 
(9-5 Big Ten, 17-11 overall) and the 
Buckeyes (4-10, 9-17-2).

“We had a meeting Saturday, 

and a lot of guys bought in, and 
you could see it on the ice,” Larkin 
said. “We had some good chances 
come from hard work back, and it 
was a good team effort.”

Midway through the second 

period, the Wolverines killed a 
five-minute penalty committed 
by 
sophomore 
defenseman 

Michael Downing for contact 
to the head, helping them ride a 
wave of momentum built by two 
second-period goals.

“That was a lot of hard work, 

and I think our team really 
knuckled down when we got 
that five-minute major and that 
really 
helped 
us,” 
Berenson 

said. “Sometimes that can be a 
motivator for your team to really 
even play harder and be more 
desperate.”

The first of those two goals 

came off the stick of Larkin at the 
5:15 mark thanks to a feed across 
the slot from junior forward Boo 
Nieves. Just over three minute 
later, freshman defenseman Zach 
Werenski netted his sixth goal of 
the season off a slapshot from the 
blue line.

His tally was set up by Larkin 

and Hyman, who swung the puck 
around the zone and created space 
for Werenski just as a Michigan 
power 
play 
was 
expiring. 

Werenski would add his second 
goal of the night at the 14:34 mark 
of the third period for the second 
multi-goal game of his career.

Werenski’s 
second 
goal 

provided a resounding answer to 
Ohio State’s first tally of the game. 
Forward Tanner Fritz corralled 
a pass in the slot and beat junior 
goaltender Steve Racine over his 
left shoulder with 7:35 left in the 
game.

And it was forward Tyler 

Lundey who netted the Buckeyes 
second goal of the night that came 
in the final minute of regulation. 
The two late goals left a minor 
blemish on an otherwise stout 
night for Racine and Michigan’s 
defensive unit.

“I think we paid more attention 

to 
playing 
better 
defense,” 

Berenson said. “Sometimes when 
you’re a good player, all you do the 
whole game is you’re hoping to get 
the puck and then you get it and 
then you hope to get it. During 
that hope time, we’ve been giving 
up too many scoring chances and 
too many goals.

“We’re trying to get that hope 

out of our game and know when 
we’re defending and when we’re 

attacking.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 

effort crept into its special-teams 
play. They were perfect on the 
penalty kill, stymying all five 
of the Buckeyes’ opportunities 
with the man-advantage. On its 
own power play, Michigan took 
advantage of Ohio State’s abysmal 
penalty-killing unit — one that 
has just a 73-percent success 
rate — converting on one of three 
chances with the extra attacker.

Most impressively, Michigan’s 

top-ranked offense got going 
again, 
particularly 
at 
even 

strength. Larkin’s nifty behind-
the-back pass to Hyman with 6:43 
remaining in the first period got 
the ball rolling on the Wolverines’ 
dire effort to split the weekend 
series.

“Playing on our chemistry, 

I just threw it, I knew he was 
going to be there and it was going 
in,” Larkin said. “We had a good 
night, and, more importantly we 
weren’t out for many goals.”

Larkin recorded his third assist 

of the night on junior forward 
Justin Selman’s goal nine minutes 
into the third period. A cross-
zone pass to the left circle was 
all Selman needed, as he caught 
goaltender Christian Frey off his 
angle to net his seventh goal of 
the year.

In the final month of the 

season, the wins and the points 
start to mean a little more than 
they 
did 
in 
November 
and 

December. Berenson and his 
players agreed that this win was 
huge in propelling them toward a 
late-season push.

Sunday’s game marked the 

first time Michigan played at 
Yost Ice Arena in 43 days, and 
Hyman didn’t hold back about the 
importance of protecting home 
ice.

“The season is winding down, 

and the last place you want to play 
is away,” he said. “Being at Yost is 
awesome, and we love playing 
here.”

Wolverines rout 
Pittsburgh, Duke

Michigan closes 
dual-meet season 
with 28-9, 33-7 
non-league wins

By MICHAEL GRIFFIN

For the Daily 

In the final weekend of dual 

meets this season, the Michigan 
wrestling team made a point to 
assert itself against strong out-
of-conference competition.

The Wolverines dominated 

No. 24 Pittsburgh in a 28-9 win 
Friday night before beating Duke 
on Saturday, 33-7.

Michigan 
looked 
strong 

over the course of both meets 
and 
received 
important 

and 
sometimes 
unexpected 

contributions 
from 
several 

wrestlers.

The 
most 
surprising 

performance of the weekend 
came 
from 
Garrett 
Sutton, 

a freshman wrestling at 165 
pounds. After losing his first 
two matches of the season, he 
helped carry the Wolverines to 
victory all weekend, winning 4-1 
and 10-3 on Friday and Saturday, 
respectively. 
Michigan 
coach 

Joe McFarland was pleased with 
Sutton’s improvement.

“Garrett was lean and light a 

couple of weeks ago,” McFarland 
said. “He’s got his body back up, 
he’s feeling good now, he’s feeling 
like he’s got more zip and energy 
out there. You can see it. His body 
just looks better.”

Associate head coach Sean 

Bormet emphasized the technical 
aspect of Sutton’s wins.

“He’s 
making 
good 

adjustments, 
getting 
more 

relaxed and comfortable out 
there,” Bormet said. “He really 
focused on riding tough. In the 
other matches (in weekends 
past) he was overthinking and 
letting guys go a little too easy. 
He’s really tough on top, and he’s 
got to use that to his advantage. 

He did that this weekend.”

While the wins gave the 

team confidence as the dual 
season wraps up, the meets also 
highlighted 
concerns 
about 

depth on the squad, a recurring 
problem all season.

The Wolverines returned two 

wrestlers who had been out for 
extended periods in junior Rossi 
Bruno and redshirt sophomore 
Taylor Massa. But only one, 
Bruno, 
enjoyed 
success 
this 

weekend. Massa sat out Saturday 
after dropping his match on 
Friday, and his replacement, 
fifth-year senior Jake Salazar, 
lost 
a 
heartbreaker 
against 

Duke’s Trey Adamson, 4-3, in the 
final seconds.

The Wolverines were also 

without freshman standout Alec 
Pantaleo, who both coaches said 
was taking the weekend off to 
deal with a few small injuries. 
Replacing Pantaleo was redshirt 
sophomore Angelo Latora, who 
lost both of his matches at the 
149-pound weight class. The 
losses in the two events wrestled 
by replacements were the only 
ones Michigan dropped, and 
they were also the only truly 
close matches of the weekend, 
highlighting the need for depth 
in an otherwise strong team.

The strongest performances, 

though, came from the team 
captains, fifth-year senior Max 
Huntley and sophomore Adam 
Coon. Huntley, wrestling for the 
last time at Cliff Keen Arena, had 
two successful matches, scoring 
a technical fall against Duke 
on Saturday and winning 17-6, 
while scoring a 5-1 victory over 
Pittsburgh’s 
Nick 
Bonaccorsi 

on Friday. Coon, coming off a 
victory at Iowa last weekend, 
contributed two wins, including 
a major decision Saturday.

With their two final matches 

and home schedule complete, 
the Wolverines head into the Big 
Ten Championships on March 
7 in Columbus two wins richer 
and boasting quite a bit more 
confidence.

WRESTLING
Home ice, blocked shots help 
Michigan to bounce-back win

Yost crowd lifts 
Wolverines to 

major penalty kill, 

Sunday win

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

Midway through the second 

period 
Sunday, 
sophomore 

defenseman Michael Downing 
stonewalled 
an 
Ohio 
State 

skater in front of the bench, 
drawing a major penalty and a 
game ejection as a packed Yost 
Ice Arena booed in disapproval.

But with each pad save and 

cleared puck, all 5,800 fans — 
back to watch the Michigan 
hockey team skate on home 
ice for the first time since Jan. 
11 — cheered louder, and the 
Wolverines 
killed 
the 
five-

minute power play opportunity.

“That’s huge,” said senior 

forward Zach Hyman. “We 
were up 3-0 at that point, so the 
next goal was really big from 
that standpoint.

“That’s what your PK needs to 

do, is kill those kind of penalties, 
and we did that today.”

Following a road loss Friday 

in Columbus, the Wolverines’ 
defense 
looked 
similarly 

reenergized in their regular-
season series finale with the 
Buckeyes, 
helping 
junior 

goaltender Steve Racine to a 5-1 
victory.

A second period featuring five 

penalties — two against Ohio 
State, three against Michigan 
— may have otherwise hurt the 
Wolverines, who have struggled 
both to find twine on the power 
play and to kill penalties of late. 
The offense had been frustrated 
by Ohio State’s shot blocking 
Friday and had many of its best 
chances shooed away.

Instead, Michigan capitalized 

on both of its chances against 
the nation’s worst penalty kill. 
After having his shot blocked 
in the first period, freshman 

defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

scored from the blue line just 
moments 
after 
the 
second 

power play expired.

Perhaps more importantly, 

the Wolverines closed the gap in 
shots blocked, 
blocking nine 
attempts 
to 

Ohio State’s 11. 
The Buckeyes 
out-blocked 
Michigan 
in 
the 
first 

period, 7-3.

Werenski 

— who took a 
penalty in the 
first 
period 

— got a second goal from the 
left circle late in the third 
period. And on his final shift, 
Werenski blocked two shots 
from a desperate Ohio State 
forecheck.

Despite being outshot in the 

game, 30-23, the Wolverines 
won the shot-blocking battle 
and 
ultimately 
the 
game. 

Michigan blocked 18 shots to 
the Buckeyes’ 16.

“We were better,” Berenson 

said. “We had some good shot 
blocks on our end, and we 
didn’t allow them to block as 

many 
shots. 

… They’re a 
good team in 
shot-blocking 
— as good as 
anybody 
we 

play.”

The 
long-

awaited 
return 
to 

Yost was also 
highlighted 
by 
guest 

appearances 
from 
football 

coach Jim Harbaugh and former 
quarterback Denard Robinson. 
After the final buzzer, “The 
Victors” echoed for the first 
time in seven weeks.

“The 
season 
is 
winding 

down, and the last place you 
want to play is away,” Hyman 
said. “Being at Yost is awesome, 

and we love playing here.”

Friday, on the other hand, 

the Wolverines struggled to 
slow down Ohio State. Though 
Racine — who allowed six 
goals in his last start at Value 
City Arena — was far from 
outstanding, the defense in 
front of him wasn’t much 
better.

The loss was in large part a 

consequence of blocked shots. 
Michigan outshot the Buckeyes 
39-32 and won the faceoff battle 
handily, but blocked fewer than 
10 shots in the game.

“Look at the blocked shots 

for Ohio State,” Berenson said 
Friday. “They did a great job, 
and we didn’t. I don’t know if 
that was the difference in the 
game, but that shows up.”

For 
comparison, 
the 

Wolverines blocked 17 shots in a 
losing effort to Minnesota.

But the Buckeyes couldn’t 

duplicate their winning recipe 
Sunday at Yost, where they left 
the ice without a win.
