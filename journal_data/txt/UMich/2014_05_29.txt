but one team,
the saying On Baseball
"Wait'til next
year" is little more than a cushion
to the blow of defeat.
But after a second season under
coach Erik Bakich, Michigan
baseball has something brewing
for 2015.
The team lost in every way
possible, failingto get above .500
until May. But bythe time the
Wolverines finished behind only
No. 9 Indiana and No. 23 Nebraska
in the Big Ten Tournament, the
youth that had lost so many early
games became the team's greatest
strength.
Now, with up to 27 of 32 players
returning next season and another
top recruiting class coming in,
Bakich has the pieces necessary
for his vision of success to become
reality.
The 2014 season began with
nothing but agony for the Wolver-
ines. On Feb. 14, Michigan opened
its season by blowing late-game
leads of three and four runs in
consecutive extra-inning losses
to Texas State and Washington.
The next week was no better: The
Wolverines dropped three one-run
games to Houston.

Lehmann and freshman left-
hander Brett Adcock were 0-2

The atmosphere of TD Ameri-

Nebraska was the stadium's ten-
ant.
Among the sea of red, there
were glimpses of maize, though
the color was more prevalent on
security guards wandering the
aisles than Michigan fans.
Saturday morning, the fifth-
seeded Wolverines couldn't
force a second

Cornhuskers' sixth run before
endingthe 36-minute inning.
The damage had been done,
and Michigan couldn't revive
itself.
"You can't give free passes to
good teams," Bakich said. "It's
the difference of getting strike
one and strike two on a hitter ver-
sus ball one and ball two. ... We
got behind a lot of hitters there in
the middle."
Nebraska (18-6,40-18) couldn't
pile on any more runs before the
slaughter ended. But each swing
of the bat brought the Wolver-
ines' season closer to its end.

mulated five two-out RBIs, struck

As her tenure comes to a close,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman traveled to California to
receive recognition for her efforts
in international engagement.
Tuesday, Coleman was honored
with the Cassandra Pyle Award
for Leadership and Collaboration
in International Education and
Exchange from NAFSA: Associa-
tion of International Educators at a
ceremony in San Diego.
NAFSA is a nonprofit organiza-
tion that works to promote inter-
national exchange and global
education. Apart from serving as
NAFSA president from 1978 to
1979, Cassandra Pyle - the award's
namesake - held positions at simi-
lar organizations like the Coun-
cil for International Exchange of
Scholars, American Council on
Education and the Institute of
International Education.
The previous Pyle recipients
include Julia Chang Bloch, founder
and president of the US-China Edu-
cation Trust and the first Asian-
American U.S. ambassador, and
Zuhair A.G. Humadi, who assists

Pescovitz named
one of the most
powerful women in
healthcare
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Summer News Editor
All audience members in the
near-full Kahn Auditorium in the
A. Alfred Taubman Biomedical
Science Research Building were
engaged as the University's Exec-
utive Vice President for Medi-
cal Affairs gave her final speech
Wednesday evening.
The institute held a presenta-
tion and farewell reception for
Ora Pescovitz, University execu-
tive vice president for medical
affairs for the last five years. She
titled her presentation, "UMH-
Story: Strength, Strategy &
Success" in honor of the charac-
teristics she believed made the
University of Michigan Health

System one of the top medical
institutions in the country.
As CEO of the University
Health System and EVPMA,
Pescovitz was responsible for the
leadership of the University hos-
pitals and health centers, medical
school, services of the School of
Nursing and the Michigan Health
Corporation.
During her tenure, she
helped develop the North Cam-
pus Research Complex into a
renowned institution and helped
build the C.S. Mott Children's and
Von Voigtlander Women's Hospi-
tal. The medical center received
its highest-ever patient satisfac-
tion scores, the research endeav-
ors earned $61 million in royalties
and the medical school created
the Office for Health Equity and
Inclusion all under Pescovitz's
leadership
After receiving her M.D. from
Northwestern University, Pesco-
vitz became a distinguished pedi-
atric endocrinologist, later being
recognized as one of Modern

Healthcare's 2009 Top 25 Women
in Healthcare and a nominee for
their list of the "100 Most Power-
ful People in Healthcare."
Pescovitz also worked as a
researcher, with a portfolio of
170 published scientific papers
on human growth and over 175
manuscripts on growth disorder.
Pescovitz's presentation
praised the doctors, students and
patients she believed to exemplify
UMHS' excellence. She included
videos of patients, researchers
and medical residents to show-
case their own work and laud
their respective achievements.
"You drive our tripartite mis-
sion, and your potential to impact
and influence the world is simply
limitless," she told the audience.
"What I admire so much about
this place is that we are never
satisfied and we are never con-
tent. In fact, a desire to constantly
improve is built into our DNA."
Following her lecture, six of
her close coworkers gave speech-

leaving this issue up to chance
at the polls in November," State
Rep. Adam Zemke (D- Ann
Arbor) said.
Zemke said some legislators
are reluctant about raising the
minimum wage for they believe it
will eliminate job opportunities.
When the Obama administration
originally proposed an increase
to $10.10, the Professional Bud-
get Office estimated how many
jobs would be lost with the
hired numbers. They found that
150,000 people would lose their
jobs, but 700,000 people would
be pulled out of poverty. As the
passed bill was lower than $10.10,
both numbers would be lower,
but the ratio would remain about
the same.
The economic definition of
poverty is based on those who
receive public assistance, which
takes an economic toll on a state's
budget.
"If you are significantly reduc-
ing the amount of people on pub-
lic assistance ... that's huge for
not only for the quality of life
improvement for (those people),
it is also a significant decrease
of a burden on the state," Zemke
said.
Public Policy Prof. Sandra

Danziger said she was also
pleased with the new increase,
but hopes for a higher minimum
wage in the future.
"The Michigan minimum
wage increase will help many
people and is an important step,"
Danziger said. "It is less than the
federal call for $10.10 per hour
and far less than a living wage.
And, it continues to treat tipped
workers unequally. Low wage
work without either benefits or
opportunities to move up creates
long term economic insecurity."
On the contrary, Econom-
ics and Public Policy Prof. Alan
Deardorff said a significant
increase in minimum wage will
harm the national economy and
boost unemployment. How-
ever, because the number has
remained relatively low over the
past few years, he does not see
this increase as a threat.
"I'm not a big fan of the mini-
mum wage, since if it is set too
high, I do believe it will cause
more harm through unem-
ployment than benefit through
increased wages of those who
remain employed," Deardorff
said. "But the current minimum
wage in the US is low enough that
I don't think that is a big concern,
and since it hasn't risen for many
years, it needs to be increased."

The walk off

ALLAHASSEE, Fla. - By
the time Florida State
rushed
the field to MAX
celebrate its BULTMAN
Women's Col-
lege World On Softaboll
Series berth,
there was nothing more Michigan
could do.
Courtney Senas, the Seminoles'
lightning-rod center fielder from
Wahiawa, Hawaii, hit a two-run
walk-off home run, and there was
no bringing it back. Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins always asks
her team to keep fighting, but now
there were no more battles to fight.
All that was left for the Wolver-
ines to do was watch Senas leap in
the air before touching first, then
see her move into a dead sprint
toward home, then try to collect
themselves walking off the field
for the toughest moments in all of
sports.
When a season ends, inevitably,
so does a career, or two, or six.
For outfielders Lyndsay Doyle
and Nicole Sappingfield, Senas'
home run meant they would never
again start the game in the out-
field, where they've played togeth-

er for their entire careers.
For designated player Taylor
Hasselbach, no more home runs
that make everyone in the stadium
wonder how she didn't play more
often early in her career.
For first baseman Caitlin
Blanchard, she was now just
an alumnus of the program she
has followed since long before
Hutchins invited her to be a part
of it. To Brandi Virgil, the two-
run shot meant her days pinch-
running were done, and for Katie
Luetkens, it was time to christen a
new leader of The Bench Mob.
Looking back, Hasselbach had
her chances with the bases loaded.
Virgil could have been called safe
instead of out on atag at home in
the fifth inning, and Blanchard
was stuck watching from third in
the seventh.
But that wasn't important once
reality sunk in. Hutchins said she
was proud of her team's heart, and
from a coach like her, she meant it.
No one outside the program
knows what Hutchins said in the
huddle she called while the Semi-
noles jumped up and down around
home plate, then rolled around on
the infield dirt, then ran around

Michigan won game one of the Super Regional and went down to the wire in game three, but lost on a walk-off home run.

screaming and hugging. But
you can bet it involved the word
"pride."
After all, they had done every-
thing she's preached since day one.
They played the game pitch by
pitch, like Hasselbach and Doyle
did last week with their unthink-
able plays to beat Arizona State.
They did their part, like Virgil
when she came into nearly every
game to pinch run, then left each
one without protest. Sapping-
field played through the flu in

100-degree weather.
It was understandable, then, for
Hutchins to get a little choked up
when asked to reflect on her senior
group.
"It's tough," Hutchins said. "It's
tough to say goodbye."
The Wolverines have plenty of
returning talent, and even more
in the incoming recruiting class.
They could very well make anoth-
er run next year behind sopho-
more shortstop Sierra Romero and
the same pitching staff of juniors

Haylie Wagner and Sara Driesenga
and freshman Megan Betsa.
But right now, it's hard to
imagine any of that without Sap-
pingfield, Doyle, Blanchard, Has-
selbach, Virgil or Luetkens.
In college sports, it's still about
winning with the people you want
to win with.
This team wanted to win
together, and it could have won
together. That's why it hurt so bad
when there was nothing left it
could do.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - In
a groundbreaking disclosure,
Google revealed how very white
and male its workforce is - just
2 percent of its Googlers are
black, 3 percent are Hispanic,
and 30 percent are women.
The search giant said Wednes-
day that the transparency about
its workforce - the first disclo-
sure of its kind in the largely
white, male tech sector - is an
important step toward change.
"Simply put, Google is not
where we want to be when it

comes to diversity," Google Inc.
senior vice president Laszlo
Bock wrote in a blog.
The numbers were compiled
as part of a report that major
U.S. employers must file with
the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission. Companies
are not required to make the
information public.
The gender divide is based
on the roughly 44,000 people
Google employed throughout
the world at the start of this year.
The company didn't factor about
4,000 workers at its Motorola
Mobility division, which is being
sold to China's Lenovo Group
for $2.9 billion. The racial data
is limited to Google's roughly
26,600 workers in the U.S as of
August 2013.

Sixty feet. Besides about 1,000
miles down to Tallahassee, Fla.
for the Super Regionals, Cait-
lin Blanchard's journey took her
around the country for weekend
tournaments and on countless
drives to Ann Arbor in between.
Now, she found herself at third

scoring, giving Michigan the lead
and continuing her dream.
Blanchard followed the 2005
Michigan softball team, the first
team east of the Mississippi River
to win the national championship.
That dream was years in the mak-
ing, and sincethat teamgotitshappy
ending, Blanchard has wanted one
of her own. The daughter of two
Michigan graduates, she grew up in
nearby Petersburg, Mich., coming
to Michigan softball games all the
time and dreamingthat it would be
her on Alumni Field one day.
But growing up ina town with a
population of just over 1,000, those
opportunities aren't easy to find.
Though she starred on her high
school team and worked her way
up to better travel teams as often as
she could, she was rarely noticedby
big schools.
Not until Blanchard arrived
in Ann Arbor did she realize that
there were players who were
offered full scholarships almost on
the spot. But she wouldn't have it
any other way.
"It was definitely difficult to get
noticed, but I kind of like the fact
that I knew what Michigan soft-
ball was all about coming into it,"

Blanchard said on April 9. "I have
a shirt signed by the 2005 national
championship team. Other people,
they don't know who the players on
that team were, whereas I kind of
idolized them."
Several Michigan players have
said that the program has tested
them in ways they've never been
tested before, that this is the
hardest part of their careers. For
Blanchard, getting here was no
easy task, either.
It took years of hard work, an
intense desire and an element of
chance. Then, she got the chance
to live the dream she had watched
play out five years earlier.
Ironically, Blanchard had to
travel across the country to get
noticed by coaches who worked at
a school 30 miles from her house.
She played for a handful of differ-
ent teams over the years, in front
of too many colleges to count, but
there was only one she ever wanted
to play for.
People sometimes use the
term "dream" as a cliche, but for
Blanchard, coming to Michigan
was just that. When she caught a
pitching lesson taught by Jennie
Ritter, who led the Wolverines to
the 2005 national championship
with five wins in the Women's
College World Series, she was
awestruck. When Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins called her the first
time to tell her she was interested,
Blanchard said she almost passed
out.
Eventually, Hutchins offered
Blanchard the chance to join the

team as a walk-on, but there was
one more roadblock to overcome -
paying tuition.
Blanchard's grandparents
answered the bell, agreeing to pay
her tuition and allowing her to ful-.
fill her dream.
"When they told me that news,"
Blanchard said, "I almost had a
heart attack."
On a team stocked with All-
Americans who had chosen Michi-
gan over several other top schools,
Blanchard became a regular. This
year, she hit behind sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero, who bat-
ted almost .500 and was a National
Player of the Year finalist.
One of the bestin program histo-
ry, Blanchard was not. A formidable
hitter to protect Romero, she was.

"Caitlin is what we call a gamer,"
Hutchins said on April 9. "Caitlin
has been hitting in the middle of
the lineup for a long time because
she's clutch. She thrives under pres-
sure.... She doesn't make more of it
than it is. Those kids do well. They
stay consistent because they're not
caught up in the surroundings."
For years, schools around the
country overlooked Blanchard,
including her dream school. But
years after she found Michigan,
Michigan finally found her.
In the end, Blanchard came
to Michigan for the same kind of
fairytale ending the Wolverines
earned in 2005. In her first three

the dream seemed unlikely. But
Michigan won the regional, thanks
in part to a go-ahead two-run
homer by Blanchard in the first of
two elimination games against the
Sun Devils.
Michigan loaded the bases with
no outs inthe seventh inning of a tie
game last Friday night. Blanchard
moved up to third with two outs on
a fielder's choice.
But she was stranded there, and
then.things went downhill: In the
bottom half, Florida State hit a
walk-off two-run home run to end
Blanchard's career.
Blanchard was playing first base
during thatshot, and she watched it
clear the left-field fence easily. She
walked toward the dugoutafterthe
game and stood there, speechless.
Was it really over? Nine years, nine
NCAA Tournaments and seven
Big Ten championships after she
watched Hutchins' team win the
national championship, would she
really never put on a Michigan uni-
form again?
When the 2005 team won the
national title, it sparked an invin-
cible dream inside Blanchard.
She never got the fairytale end-
ing she always sought. But then
again, maybe she was living it all
along

"I'm not a

Blanchard said.

Technology may
be implemented in
medical science
By CAROLYN GEARIG
Managing Design Editor '
Terahertz rays may be invis-
ible to the human eye, but Uni-
versity research on these waves is
spotlighting their possible uses,
ranging from deciphering water
content in a bodily tissue to detect-
ing concealed weapons on a person
to quality control in manufactur-
ing.
T-rays, as they are called, are
not as ubiquitous as other energies
on the electromagnetic spectrum,
like ultraviolet waves, which are
used in barcodes, medical light
therapy, DNA sequencing and
other applications. However, a
detector developed by Engineer-
ing Prof. Jay Guo and his research
lab could allow T-rays to become
more of a household necessity.
T-rays fall on the electromag-
netic spectrum below infrared
waves - energy that's harnessed
in-things like remote controls and
heat lamps that warm food - and
visible light, which humans can
see. They have shorter wave-
lengths and are of a higher energy
than microwaves and radio waves.
Though T-rays have been dif-
ficult for engineers to study and to
develop technologies around, Guo
said their uses are quite varied.
"It is a scientifically rich fre-
quency band and offers unique
value for imaging, chemical iden-
tification and characterization of
materials," Guo wrote in an email.

Current T-ray detectors are dif-
ficult to work with because they
are too cumbersome, need espe-
cially cold temperatures or are
unable to work in real time. Guos'
transducer - a technology which,
in essence, transforms one form of
energy to another - eases this pro-
cess by allowing for T-ray conver-
sion into sound waves.
The transducer is composed
of plastic and carbon nanotubes.
When T-rays reach the device, they
are absorbed by the nanotubes
and turned into heat energy. This
energy is passed onto the plastic,
which is called polydimethylsilox-
ane, PDMS for short. The PDMS
expands and makes an ultrasound
wave.
Researchers developed an
ultrasound detector, a tiny plastic
ring that is only a few millimeters
wide. This detector has a response
time of a fraction of a millionth of
a second. Guo said this allows for
real-time terahertz imaging most
of the time.
"The low photon energy of tera-
hertz radiation is biologicallysafe,"
Guo wrote. "Therefore develop-
ing small and easy-to-operate
terahertz components, including
sources, waveguides, and detec-
tors, would benefit both funda-
mental research and applications."
While the team's work is cur-
rently devoted to the development
of a compact, sensitive and fast
T-ray detector capable of oper-
ating in room temperature, Guo
hopes they will be able to improve
the sensitivity. Improved sensitiv-
ity can show video-rate imaging,
opening doors for more uses and
opportunities with T-rays.

In many cases this year,
Blanchard's job was to punish
teams that decided not to pitch to

she came through.

Minnesota, the Wolverines needed

Pescovitz acknowledged the
unique challenges the UMHS has
faced over the course of her tenure,
including the effects of the national
healthcare reform, decreased fed-
eral funding for research, the grow-
ing competition among medical
schools and the increasing difficul-
ty for students to pay for a medical

Amending allocations
Ann Arbor had both gains and lossses in its 2015 fiscal budget
Last Monday, the Ann Arbor City Council reviewed
17 amendments to the $334 million fiscal year 2015
city budget. The council voted to reallocate funds to
numerous areas in need of assistance such as transportation,
animal management, clean energy and affordable housing.
Unfortunately, efforts to redirect funds from the police force
to drug rehabilitation assistance were thwarted with only two
councilmembers voting in favor of the amendment. While the
city council acted commendably by distributing much needed
funds to road management, road repair and clean energy, failing
to provide further provide resources to those suffering from
substance abuse is a misstep on the council's behalf.

Before writing this column, I
made a rookie mistake, doing the
first and only thing that should
be avoided while preparing to
word-vomit about any particu-
lar film, let alone what I already
considered Singer's masterpiece.
I read Scott's review. At the
time, it seemed like a carefully
reasoned decision - even that
crotchety old shit had to have
liked this 130-minute dedica-
tion to every, single. thing that
made comic-book adaptations
great. The heavy-hearted per-
formances. The explosions; That
sexy retroactive continuity (ret-
con for the geeks). And the '70s,
baby, *softer voice* the '70s. This
film had it all - there was no
possible way whatsoever that his
review could be anything less
than fawning. All I wanted was
to check what kind of Wolverine
jokes the highbrows at The New
York Times thought would work.
'Was the word "bub" used at all?'
But my boy Scott and his fore-
head never fail to disappoint.
It was like beinglowered head-
first into a chilling tub of lique-
fied Macklemore albums, every
desperate gasp for breath a dis-
appointing confirmation of my
willingness to overlook simplic-
ity just so I could buy into this
superficial, bandwagon mental-
ity. Was I really too stupid to pick
apart the obvious plot-holes?
All the ham-fisted imagery -
anchored around Magneto's diz-
zying display of power in lifting
the entirety of RFK Stadium and
dumping it at President Nixon's
feet, thus setting the stage for our
climax - was I wrong in reacting
by silently mouthing "symbol-
ism, bitches" at the theater?
Being a film critic, however
fledgling, should I have seen it
as the "gratuitous, imagination-
deficient grandstanding" that
Scott described? I stayed up
half the night thinking about it,
tossing and turning in a boiling
vat of existential doubt thicker
than Toad's adhesive spit. But
then something occurred to me.
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about Scott
since.

The city council passed two
separate road amendments
that are slated to enhance
the Ann Arbor community
for both students and
local residents. The first
amendment places $75,000
into services for managing
deer and other animals.
Michigan drivers experience
40,000-50,000 deer-vehicle
collisions each year. These
populations must be managed
in order to promote the safety
of residents. The second
amendment proposes that
city administrators outline
a plan for alternative street
repair funding. Given the
consistent dissatisfaction with
Ann Arbor roads coupled with
the University's bus services
and commuting students, this
amendment proves vital to
enhancing an impactful facet
of student life.

The council voted against an
amendment that would invest
$100,000 from the Affordable
Housing Fund into a warming
center for the homeless.
Recently, University students
have worked to increase
accessibility to affordable
housing for students with lower
socioeconomic backgrounds.
With the campus climate in
support of cheaper housing,
choosing to maintain the
affordable housing budget could
helpprovide studentswithmore
leverage in the conversation.
Furthermore, the council
intends to expand warming
shelters this winter with intent
to discuss suggestions with
community partners deterring
negative impacts to the city's
homeless populations.
Unfortunately, the city
council voted against an
amendment to reallocate

$95,000 from police staffing
toward programs that help
prevent and treat addiction.
The amendment would have
decreased the number of new
police officers being added
from three to two. Nine
council members opposed the
amendment, believing funds
were better used towards. a
proactive police force and
court-ordered treatment.
These beliefs, however, are
seriously flawed. Crime rates
in Ann Arbor are at historic
lows while drug and alcohol
use are higher than average
for Washtenaw County
adolescents. Instead of
focusing on patrollingcitizens,
Ann Arbor should help further
fund addiction prevention for
young residents and addiction
treatment in order to the
enhance the mental wellness
of its citizens.

myself otherwise. I, in part due to
the media and inaction on the part of
United States politicians, had allowed
gun violence to become normal, an
expected part of daily life.
However, I've been able to reflect
and realize the difference between a
gun and the person behind it. I've seen
that ignorance can lead to hate-driven
violence, that our society accepts anger
as a reaction to rejection, that some
individuals are not given the proper
care and facilities they need. However,
most of all, I've seen and learned that
there is not one blanket solution to
mass shootings. Each shooter has had
their own reasons for their actions,
and although taking the lives of others
is never justified, I think we have
learned that simply limiting access to
guns won't be enough.
So, what's the conversation we really
needtohave?Isitthewaythatthemedia

sorry about my son's death. You go back
to Congress and you do something, and
you come back to me and tell me you've
done something, then I'll be interested
in talking to you."
It's time to stop accepting mass
shootings as an everyday reality and
question how our. nation even got to
this place to begin with. Allowing a
person to carelessly end the lives of
others should never be allowed, nor
should it be a consideration for anyone.
And mostly, it's time to stop pretending
that we have no way to prevent these
senseless murders. It was unbelievable
after Columbine, it was heartbreaking
after Sandy Hook and now, after the
UCSB shooting, it's absolutely absurd.
We've been waiting for action long
enough, and it's time that Congress
finally answers the call.

isa"hardscience,"Iremindyouthat
when I was an economics graduate
student at Michigan during the
second half of the 1960s you were
taught that the answers were (in
order) "no," "rarely" and "definitely
not." But today, the eponymous
economics student, obeying the
entreaty on the old graduate library
to "be still and learn," would enter
on his iPad, "very likely," "almost
always" and "yes."
In those bygone days of
yesteryear, Michigan economics
occupied the mainstream of the
discipline - even more, was the
bedrock of the mainstream -
Keynesian for macroeconomics and
neoclassical for microeconomics.
Michigan's particular twist on this
incompatible heterodox union was
to treat macro as the serious part
and micro as a hoop through which
the neophyte economist must jump.
The difference between neo-
classical economics and heterodox
economics both then and now is
how each defines the subject of the
discipline. For the neoclassicals
the "economic problem" is how to
allocate scarce resources in face
of unlimited demands. At Michi-
gan in the 1960s, I learned quite a
different definition of economics.
Before explaining the alternative,
let's pursue the implications of the
scarce resources paradigm for the
debate over the federal govern-
ment's budget deficit.
Because resources are scarce,
a country lives beyond its means
when its government runs deficits
and goes into debt. The debt mustbe
repaid from the scarce resources of
the future. This is the deficit crisis
in a nutshell; people and politicians
foolishly allowing the government
to mislead them into believing that
a free lunch can be found in budget
deficits. The world would be an eas-
ier place if resources were abundant
and needs limited, but we must face
reality. If we do not, the operations
of markets will bring the reality of
scarcity home to us. Markets guide
the allocation of scarce resources
to their best use and going against
markets is a fool's game.
A very large proportion of the
adult population of the United
States accepts this parable of scarce

means and unlimited needs even if
innocent of the underlying theory.
Isn't that what population growth
and a limited earth add up to poli-
cies of austerity, for households
or governments? Isn't it no more
than the consumption excesses of
humans coming home to roost?
Actually, no. As I learned in the
1960s when an undergraduate at
Texas and a graduate student at
the University, the scarce-means-
unlimited-needs story is not
reality. It's analytical construction
that contradicts reality. Resources
are not scarce. Economics is about
the allocation of scarce resources
among unlimited needs to the same
extent that astronomy is the study
of horoscopes.
The most important resource in
any society is the laboring ability of
its population. At the end of 2010,
one of every 10 members of the U.S.
labor force was unemployed, and by
the latest statistics unemployment
is still well above 6 percent. With
this level of unemployment, we
should not be surprised that
utilization of production capacity is
below 80 percent. Idle workers, idle
factories and offices, and homes in
Detroit and other cities standing
empty and abandoned. Resources
are scarce?
To put the matter simply, when
something is in surplus, it is not
scarce. I learned that bit of rock-
et science studying economics at
Michigan. The remote possibility
that resources could suffer from a
shortage in the future does not make
scarcity economics plausible. If soci-
ety does not use all of its resources,
there is no danger of running out. In
most countries in most years, labor
and the machinery to employ that
labor are not scarce.
So what is the central economic
problem in a market society? Not
how to allocate scarce resources;
we can be sure that is wrong. The
central problem is how to use pro-
ductively the resources available
to society. Unregulated markets
do not provide the solution to that
problem. What, then, is the eco-
nomics problem, in contrast to the
alchemy of scarce resources? Eco-
nomics is the study of how society
brings its available resources into
production, and distributes that
production among its members.

Trigger warning: mental health
issues and substance abuse
There are so many things I find

here in good

The one that I
really struggle
with the most, VICTORIA
though, is our NOBLE
bizarre ten- _
dency to, for
lack of a better
word, baby young adults. It's a shel-
tering mechanism as far as I can
tell, which we use to protect youth
fromthe massive,terrible problems
of our world. But childhood isn't
all it's cracked up to be either, and
Americans kids have all sorts of
problems unique to their age group
and generation. Who should solve
those problems? Why the kids, of
course.
Too bad schools aren't letting
them. Instead of allowing
students to openly discuss,
the source of all truly decent
solutions, difficult problems
like adolescent mental health,
academic stress, substance
abuse and bullying remain
wholly unsolved and partially
unaddressed. Herein lies
the problem: all those adults
contemplating these issues
already made it through their
teenage years. No wonder so
many adults write them off as
"part of growing up." There's a
selection affect at work - those
suffering the most can't be part
of the solution when the adults
are in charge.
Madeline Halpert and Eva
Rosenfeld, two students at an Ann
Arbor high school, noticed that
despite the fact about one in four

mental disorder, it's still difficult
for so many to talk about, especially
in high school. The absurd, illogical

interviewed a student who gave a
personal account of being high on

the school, from the substance

Prior review and restraint
is more common than many
realize. Supreme Court decisions
on Tinker v. Des Moines and
Hazelwood v.Kuhlmeier expressly
allow school administrators the
option of prior review and prior
restraint. But, by overextending
this power, school officials are
silencing student voices,
I identify with Halpert and
Rosenfeld. They tried to do what
educators, public health advocates
and even this opinion section have

like mine.
Throughthisdoublestandard,high
school officials contribute to the
horrifying mental health stigma
that their students have their
courage and will to solve.
More importantly, schools
need to prepare students to think
independently and challenge the
tenants of society. Prior review
obliterates student responsibility,
their ability to challenge power
relations and lead discussion on
issues at their school. If we don't
allow and encourage this type
of engagement in high schools,
what kind of adults can we expect
these students to become? Student
journalism is undeniably a venue
for promising discussion. It's
an important outlet to open and
set the tone for so many other
forums. High school is more than
academic preparation. Students
should graduate with deepened
understanding and empathy for
the broad array of difficulties that
others may face.

It's difficult to believe the
"X-Men" film franchise is nearly
14 years old - that's a lot of time

a lot of poor sto-

"X-Men: Days of Quality16
Future Past" is a
testament to the 20th Century Fox
tenaciousness of
comic-book cre-
ativity, as it delivers an exciting
yet intimate and engaging super-
hero flick.
The task at hand is a great one as
"Future Past" serves both as sequel,
prequel and time-travel reset but-
ton. Credit is due to returning
director Bryan Singer ("Jack the
Giant Slayer") and writer Simon
Kinberg ("Sherlock Holmes") for
taking an otherwise elusive plot
and laying it out on screen to nearly
perfect accord.
The film opens with a glimpse
of the future, where Terminator-
like Sentinels patrol the world to
hunt down mutants and humans
with a chance of passing on mutant

genes. The remaining X-Men (some
from movies past, others undoubt-
edly to be seen in movies to come)
fight a losing war for survival. In
a last ditched effort to alter their
present, they send the conscious-
ness of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman,
"The Wolverine") into the body of
his younger self in a Vietnam War-
weary America.
After this brief introduction with
some of your favorite X-Men and a
display of superhero prowess that
would make The Avengers jealous,
the film shifts to 1973, where Wol-
verine must track down and reunite
a reeling, alcoholic Professor Xavier
(James McAvoy, "Filth") with for-
mer friend Magneto (Michael Fass-
bender, "12 Years a Slave"). The two
continue to wage their intellectual
war over the role of mutants among
the human race; onlythis time they
do so in a fight for the soul of Mys-
tique (Jennifer Lawrence, "The
Hunger Games: Catching Fire"),
whose actions are responsible for
the horrible future to come.
The film focuses heavily on the
inner struggle of the telepathic
Professor X: a struggle with the
Vietnam War, a struggle with the
loss/deaths of his friends and fel-
low mutants and a struggle with
his own handicap as a paraple-
gic and as a mutant. And he does
see his gifts as a handicap - as he
descends into his own depression,
he feels the pain of those around
him through his telepathy, mag-
netizing his own inner demons in
the process. Magneto, by contrast,
represents sheer confidence in
his powers and the superiority of
mutants over humans, and yet he

Rather than just blow stuff up,
the film is more concerned with
character and soul-searching: and
that is why it succeeds. The action
set pieces are effective but kept at a
minimum, and fistfights comprise
the bulk of the fighting rather than
mutantdisplays of unhinged power.
The result is more realistic and,
frankly, more visually appealing
-CGI can only get you so far. The
A-list cast, not to mention a scene-
stealing performance from Evan
Peters ("Kick-Ass") as Quicksilver,
tops off this superhero extrava-
ganza.
So much of this film is about
righting wrongs: those done to
friendships, to oneself and, perhaps
most importantly, to audiences who
watched the monstrosity that is
"X-Men: The Last Stand." But it's
also about the restoration of hope
in oneself(and the franchise). "Days
of Future Past" is a smart superhero
film with something to say, whose
implications open the X-Men uni-
verse to greater continuity and
cohesion; the futureofthe X-Menis
a bright one indeed. Who would've
thought a reset button could be so
poignant?

Season two finale "Mizumono" does
not disappoint. It's unflinching trag-
edy, and arguably the best hour of
the series to date.
Instead of providing answers to
some of the season's burning ques-
tions, "Mizumono" raises new ques-
tions of its own. Will's motivations
and loyalties have become inscru-
table, as he weighs the opinions of
Jack and Hannibal on equal footing.
Hugh Dancy ("Martha Marcy May
Marlene") plays Willwith a new fer-
vency that is all the more disturbing
considering his mental instability.
The episode's opening scene conveys
this with stunning visual clarity -
dreamily jumbled close-ups of con-
versation with his therapist and his
mentor. Will can't keep his loyalties
straight.
Butthe drama isn'tall psychologi-
cal. The centerpiece of the episode
is a nightmare dinner party, flaw-
lessly designed by Hannibal to pro-
vide himself the perfect escape. Of
course, Hannibal's plan is tokill allof
the attendees and leave them bleed-
ing out while he enjoys champagne
on a flight to France. The typical
composure of Dr. Lecter (Mads Mik-
kelsen, "Casino Royale") is thrown
to the wind, as he kicks off the meal
with a gritty fight. The show finally
catches up to the kitchen battle
between Jack and Hannibal, butthis
time around, it's more devastating
than exciting. Jack is unprepared
and stumbling, biding his time with
punches until Hannibal deals the
deciding blow. Mortally wounded,

Horrifying yet
so enjoyable.
tor mode. Sadly, it'stoolittle,toolate,
as Hannibal moves to add Will to the
body count.
Of the three near-deaths, Will's
is most touching. As he lies bleed-
ing out, slain with the same tool
used to kill Abigail, Hannibal deliv-
ers a monologue about the merits
of forgiveness and playing God. He
redeems himself to Will, the pup-
pet who proved himself a formidable
friend. Will didn't accept the "rare
gift" that Hannibal offered, but it's
okay, because he forgives Will of his
sins. Will comes back from the dark
side, but his last words indicate that
it was Hannibal's plan all along.
With three main characters
bleeding out in Hannibal's home
and the grandmaster fleeing the
scene, the future of "Hannibal" is
uncertain. Like last season's ender
(in which Will was wrongly impris-
oned), we close with open-ended
tragedy. Everyone with a lead on
Hannibal's guilt is incapacitated,
while the murderer gets away
scot-free. "Hannibal" is gripping,
unapologetically dark television -
unafraid to explore the depths of
psychological evil while dealing a
fatal blow to the good guys.
