For 
Rackham 
student 

Stephanie 
Pistorius, 
living 

on-campus with her husband 

during the time of COVID-19 

has been full of uncertainty. 

She said she was not prepared 

for the impact on lab research, 

though she had been following 

the news in the weeks leading 

up 
to 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s announcement of 

the cancellation of in-person 

classes.

“(The announcement) felt 

focused 
on 
undergrads,” 

Pistorius said. 

However, with the pandemic 

spreading, she mentioned how 

not going into the lab for more 

than six weeks will derail her 

tentative graduation date.

“It’s something I’ve been 

thinking about a lot lately,” she 

said.

Pistorius works in a wet lab 

that runs experiments with 

cell lines and animals. The cell 

lines can be frozen and picked 

up once things go back to 

normal, but the animals have 

to be a certain age to conduct 

experiments 
and 
require 

her to go in periodically and 

take care of them. Once the 

University 
announced 
that 

only critical lab work would 

be permitted, Pistorius faced a 

dilemma.

“It was like a daily struggle 

of ‘Should I go in or should I 

not go in?’” Pistorius said. 

With the time she would 

usually be spending in the 

lab, Pistorius is catching up 

on 
data 
analysis, 
reading 

primary research papers and 

writing the introduction to her 

dissertation. 

“Hopefully this time I use 

to catch up (on material) will 

make me more efficient once 

I’m back in the lab,” Pistorius 

said.

Residents use 3D printers to make masks

AAPS teachers, AADL staff pool resources to address shortage of medical equipment

Several Ann Arbor engineering 

teachers are aiding a campaign 

called 
Operation 
Face 
Shield 

Ann Arbor, using 3D printers to 

create face shields for medical 

professionals on the front lines 

during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Robert Cupit, a teacher at Ann 

Arbor Public Schools, said he came 

across 
a 
video 
announcement 

from fellow teacher Bill Van Loo 

explaining how AAPS engineering 

teachers were creating 3D-printed 

face shields to donate to medical 

professionals. He had access to a 3D 

printer through the school system 

and decided he wanted to help out. 

The time it takes to create a mask 

varies, but Cupit said his machine 

takes about two-and-a-half hours. 

In an email to The Daily, Cupit 

explained how the process works. 

“I personally have 8 spools of 

filament, which is the material the 

3D printers use to print,” Cupit 

wrote. “I can make approximately 

22 shields per spool so 176 shields 

total. We have approximately 9 

people working on the project with 

3 distribution hubs. Each person 

has about the same amount, if 

not more material than I do. We 

are going to print as many as we 

possibly can with the time we have. 

The issue with scaling up is that 

once we run out it is very difficult 

to get more filament with all of this 

going on.”

Cupit and other AAPS teachers 

are working to make any personal 

protective equipment that they feel 

will help the medical professionals 

fight off the coronavirus pandemic. 

The AAPS teachers are asking for 

support 
through 
a 
GoFundMe 

page. 

“We have a lot of masks to print 

and not a lot of time to make them,” 

Cupit wrote. “People needed them 

last week and we just can’t keep up 

with the demand. The advantages 

of 3D printing are definitely cost 

and usability. You don’t have to be 

an engineer to use this equipment.”

The Central Student Government 

Student Organization Funding Committee 

distributes 
$500,000 
to 
student 

organizations every semester on a refund 

system. 
With 
student 
organizations 

canceling all in-person events following 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s “Stay Home, 

Stay Safe” Executive Order and the 

University of Michigan’s recommendation 

that students return home, it has pivoted 

to refunding as many organizations as 

possible for non-refundable expenses. 

“In cases where expenses related to a 

cancelled event were already paid for and 

cannot be refunded, SOFC will reimburse 

these expenses with valid documentation 

according to our Proof of Payment 

guidelines,” reads a statement on the 

SOFC website. “This policy change applies 

only to expenses that are ‘non-refundable’ 

and have already been incurred.” 

SOFC distributes its funds in nine 

waves over the course of the fall and 

winter 
semesters. 
The 
committee 

decided to maintain funding for waves 

seven through nine, for which student 

organizations must apply by March 23, 

March 30 and April 6 to be eligible for 

SOFC funds. 

Business 
senior 
Crede 
Strauser, 

outgoing chair of SOFC, said roughly 

$50,000 is available for the last three 

waves. Strauser said many student 

organizations are applying for funding for 

expenses not typically covered by SOFC.

“Organizations 
are 
circling 
back 

and applying for expenses they maybe 

hadn’t applied for earlier because of 

their experience knowing that SOFC is 

extremely competitive and they wanted to 

apply for the things they were most likely 

to get funds for at the time,” Strauser said. 

Typically, leftover SOFC funds rolled 

over into CSG’s fall budget. For the first 

time, funding will be available during the 

summer through a SOFC process, rather 

than requiring applicants to apply through 

the Summer Assembly and present their 

plans in person. Strauser projects $7,000 

to $8,000 will be left over for the summer 

term. 

“I think that those kinds of decisive 

actions just helps for a lot of organizations 

to not have that additional concern about 

their organization potentially having a 

negative account balance or potentially 

not being able to carry out their activities 

once they get back to normal because they 

don’t have the funds to do so,” Strauser 

said. 

Michigan 
Movement, 
a 
student-

run non-profit focused on combating 

homelessness and poverty in Washtenaw 

County, had to cancel its in-person events. 

Instead of pausing operations, MIM 

adjusted their work amid the pandemic. 

Though 
MIM’s 
seminal 
MIMKit 

event, which partners with Ann Arbor’s 

Mercy House to create more than 100 

care packages, had to be canceled after 

the governor’s stay-at-home order, MIM 

decided to instead directly provide Mercy 

House with items it needed most. 

LSA 
junior 
Lindsay 
Calka, 
vice 

president of MIM, said the community 

that 
benefits 
from 
their 
work 
is 

particularly at risk during the pandemic. 

“It was kind of like a double whammy, 

where not only is this group already going 

to be suffering effects from decisions made 

for social distancing and shelter in place, 

but we couldn’t do the things that could 

potentially help them in this scenario,” 

Calka said. “We really didn’t have the 

option to just stop. We had to pivot what 

we were doing.” 

Because the items differed from the 

long-term care items that typically fill 

MIMKit care packages, MIM had to 

apply for wave nine SOFC funding. SOFC 

granted MIM only half of what they 

requested, even though this exact amount 

applied for during the eighth funding 

wave was granted in full. 

“I think priority-wise, we should be 

seeing how we can be using our money 

the best way to serve people who need it 

right now,” Calka said. “I know there’s a 

lot going on (in the greater CSG budget) 

but it would have been nice to have that 

exact award met that we were guaranteed 

beforehand.” 

Calka said MIM is working on plans to 

continue serving vulnerable communities 

with less money than anticipated. They 

plan on filling funding gaps left both by 

SOFC and canceled fundraisers by writing 

grants and applying for funding in other 

areas. 

Engineering senior Zeke Majeske, a 

former member of CSG, said the best way 

for SOFC to support student organizations 

during this time is for them to improve 

their process with the newly freed 

time usually spent reviewing funding 

applications. 

“(I hope SOFC) spends as much money 

as they can on organizations and try 

to come up with improvements in the 

process so next semester when it gets 

rolling again, it works even better for 

students,” Majeske said.

Costas Lyssiotis, a molecular 

and 
integrative 
physiology 

professor and Ph.D. adviser, 

runs a lab that studies cancer 

cells in order to form targeted 

therapies 
to 
improve 
the 

immune system. Many of these 

experiments 
take 
multiple 

months 
and 
involve 
mice 

that need to be periodically 

monitored. Some of his lab 

members have set up a Google 

Calendar and take turns going 

into the lab in order to keep 

collecting data from the mice.

“In addition to the time 

and financial burden, we’re 

cognizant that these animals 

give their life for research 

and you want to treat them as 

fairly as possible, and so to just 

sack an experiment when the 

results were looking positive,” 

Lyssiotis said. “We deem that 

to be too extreme.”

Lyssiotis said he has been 

overwhelmed throughout the 

COVID-19 outbreak and the 

governor’s stay-at-home order, 

with his two kids occupying a 

lot of his time, but he knows 

the same isn’t true for others.

“I know some of my grad 

students are starting to exhibit 

signs of boredom — getting 

silly on Twitter, for example,” 

Lyssiotis said. 

Daniel Kremer is a Rackham 

graduate student in Lyssiotis’s 

lab, hoping to graduate in 

May. He has a paper in the 

revision 
process, 
where 

experts in his field suggest he 

conduct certain experiments 

before publishing the paper. 

However, being unable to go 

into the lab pushes back his 

tentative graduation date to 

the end of the summer.

“It was kind of like ‘You’re 

almost done. You’re almost 

free, almost across the finish 

line, but then yeah,’” Kremer 

said. 

Rackham student Christa 

Ventresca is in the middle of 

lab rotations, where graduate 

students spend several months 

in 
different 
labs 
before 

deciding on one at the end of 

the year. She said her program 

in Biomedical Sciences had 

made it easy for students, 

allowing them to join a lab they 

wanted without completing all 

the rotations. However, for 

Ventresca, spending time in 

the physical lab space was an 

important part of making a 

decision.

“(This situation) makes it 

really hard to pick a lab when 

you’re not physically in the 

lab,” she said.

Rackham student Zachary 

Reese is involved in social 

psychological 
research 

where he performs studies 

on participants from the LSA 

Psychology Subject Pools. With 

the cancellation of all human 

studies, the focus in his lab has 

shifted from data collection 

to data analysis. He said the 

Psychology Department has 

been supportive and is letting 

students work at their own 

pace, 
so 
fulfilling 
degree 

requirements was not a major 

concern. 
However, 
finding 

a job is a pressing challenge 

for Reese, especially with the 

current state of the economy.

“When looking at 2008 and 

the big recession, we know 

(those who graduated that 

year) 
had 
trouble 
finding 

jobs,” Reese said. “But when 

they did find one, they were 

much more grateful and happy 

with what they had ... I think 

finding a silver lining in all of 

this is important.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

According to Hilkert, kare, 

which is being launched as a 

mobile app, is his response to a 

stigma he noticed surrounding 

the 
use 
of 
University 
of 

Michigan’s resources, as well as 

frustration with Counseling and 

Psychology Services’ long wait 

times. 

“A lot of times it might be you 

didn’t do as well as you wanted 

to on an exam, or you had a 

breakup but maybe you’re not in 

a dire mental need,” Hilkert said. 

“We felt like maybe professional 

therapists weren’t needed there 

as much as peers, so we did a 

lot of research into peer-to-peer 

support.”

Hilkert 
began 
work 
on 

the project in fall 2019 with 

co-founders 
Business 
and 

Engineering 
junior 
Stephanie 

Shoo and Engineering senior 

Rodney Shibu. 

“We felt that a lot of students 

maybe needed problem-solving 

and stress relief more than they 

needed actual therapy,” Hilkert 

said. “So, we decided to create 

sort of a mobile application 

community, 
or 
an 
online 

community, that would allow 

students to connect and talk 

with each other anonymously, 

and hopefully make people feel a 

little better.”

Hilkert said he based his 

idea off of Wolverine Support 

Network and their peer-to-peer 

support system. 

“I thought (Wolverine Support 

Network) 
is 
a 
really 
good 

resource,” Hilkert said. “But the 

limitation there is that it’s once 

a week for an hour rather than 

being a live resource where you 

can chat at any time.”

The community feature of the 

kare app works through threads, 

where students can make groups 

about anything they want to chat 

about. 

“It could be, for example, 

‘Econ 101 homework help’ or it 

could be ‘stressed about grades’ 

or it could be ‘internship group,’” 

Hilkert said. “Then (students) 

can all sort of chat anonymously 

and create sub-threads within 

that, where they’re able to talk 

about different things that are 

bothering them.”

With the app being completely 

anonymous, the kare team has 

implemented measures designed 

to ensure kare remains a safe 

community. Users who make 

threatening statements, engage 

in cyberbullying or use names 

will have their account deleted, 

as outlined in the user agreement.

Shoo, 
who 
is 
chief 

procurement officer of kare, 

was involved with running focus 

groups 
and 
conducting 
user 

interviews with students about 

the product. According to Shoo, 

these interviews confirmed the 

need in the community for such 

a resource, with one student 

telling her he does not have 

time to wait weeks to talk to a 

professional who he feels does 

not really understand him.

“It really reaffirmed my time 

that I’ve committed to kare 

because 
that’s 
exactly 
what 

kare does,” Shoo said. “It’s an 

instantaneous 
platform 
that 

allows students to overcome that 

barrier of being worried that 

their issues aren’t big enough.”

With classes moving to an 

online 
format 
and 
students 

having to social distance, the 

team 
said 
they 
decided 
to 

accelerate work and move up the 

launch time to this month rather 

than next semester. The app is set 

to have an early release on April 

17 for the first 1,000 University 

students who sign up. 

“We really want to be a 

resource 
for 
people 
during 

this hectic time,” Hilkert said. 

“We felt like being able to chat 

anonymously, whether it be about 

your internship being potentially 

canceled or about how you’re 

handling 
different 
grading 

policies or different things … (It) 

was really important to launch 

now.” 

They all continue to work on 

the project from home through 

virtual 
meetings 
with 
their 

team, which consists of the three 

co-founders, three students in 

computer science helping on 

the technical side of the app 

and several freshmen helping 

with development and business 

management. 

Because the team wants to 

launch the app as soon as they 

can, kare is currently focused 

solely on the community aspect 

of the app. There are several 

other features the team said 

they hope to integrate in later, 

such as an active listener feature 

where students can connect with 

trained peer listeners. These 

peers would be represented by 

different keywords, such as their 

major or their ethnicity, to help 

students find individuals able to 

relate to their experiences.

Though kare is currently just 

open 
to 
University 
students, 

Shibu, who is chief technology 

officer, said they have plans to 

expand to colleges nationwide, 

and the universities they have 

already 
spoken 
to 
expressed 

interest in the app.

“We hope we can get a bunch 

of users onto the platform from 

a bunch of different universities 

because, since it is a community, 

it will be the more the merrier,” 

Shibu said. “The more people you 

have on, the more people can give 

their feedback.”

Once the staff at the Ann 

Arbor District Library heard 

about the AAPS teachers’ use of 

3D printers, they realized they 

can use their 3D printers to pitch 

in. Rich Retyi, communications 

and marketing manager at the 

AADL, 
said 
AADL 
involved 

coworkers in helping to create 

personal protective equipment. 

They have access to four large 

printers, which can print three 

shields at a time, and some 

smaller ones that can do one at 

a time. On average, the library’s 

machines make about 20 shields 

per day.

“We’ve gotten great support 

from everyone at the library, 

which 
is 
really 
important 

because they made it really easy 

for us to get the things we need 

and to just go,” Retyi said. “We’ve 

been doing a lot of stuff through 

our website. We’ve been putting 

out craft videos, entertainment 

videos, that kind of thing on our 

website, but then to be able to add 

in something that’s tangible and 

that’s directly related to what’s 

going on is important for us to be 

able to do.”

Nursing 
sophomore 
Zoe 

Gierlinger 
said 
the 
personal 

protective 
equipment 
being 

created 
by 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

community 
is 
important 
for 

doctors and nurses to have when 

treating patients. 

“One of the first things that we 

learned about is how to properly 

put on PPE and the different 

types of precautions. It ensures 

not only the safety and protection 

of the patient but also of the 

employees,” Gierlinger said. “For 

nurses taking care of someone 

with an illness, you want to make 

sure that you’re not spreading 

anything else to a patient that 

is already immunocompromised 

and you want to make sure that 

the nurse is protected because 

the nurses are working with 

other patients and coming in 

contact with other health care 

providers. It basically ensures 

the protection of both sides.”

T

he future is disturbingly 

uncertain, yet it’s the only 

thing to think about. When 

will things go back to normal? Soon, 

but also never. This generation of 

young people will be feeling the 

effects of the pandemic for a long 

time and the experience of living 

through it is going to shape the way 

they see their lives and the world 

forever. College seniors — who had 

their last months on campus and 

their graduation taken away by 

COVID-19 and are graduating into 

an uncertain world and floundering 

economy — are undoubtedly in 

a unique situation. Juniors, on 

the 
other 
hand, 

narrowly 
escaped 

that 
experience 

and instead have a 

one-year buffer.

Juniors 
have 

been given a unique 

circumstance. 

They 
are 

experiencing 

those 
shocking 

withdrawals from 

college 
which 

are 
traditionally 

associated 
with 

seniors, yet they 

still have one more shot. Three 

years on campus have felt like all of 

eternity. Most of us are at a point 

where our high school friendships 

have narrowed down to just a few 

and our college circles are the 

biggest parts of our lives. We are 

now geographically scattered, much 

as we will be after graduation.

Yet, we will return to campus in 

the fall for a school year unlike any 

other. It will have been the longest 

we have ever been apart from our 

college friends and restarting our 

normal activities will feel like a 

reunion.

After 
returning 
from 
online 

classes, we will likely have less 

of an itch to pull out our phones 

under the table. We will know how 

valuable in-person learning is after 

our 
attempted 
month-and-a-half 

of 
awkward 
Zoom 
discussions. 

When assigned a group project, 

rather than being annoyed with the 

difficult task of finding a common 

meeting time, we might just be 

glad we get to interact with our 

classmates in person.

After three years in the same spot, 

college seniors of past years may 

have been itching to leave campus. 

Everything they wanted to try was 

done and every place they wanted to 

see was seen. The horrible landlord 

was frustrating, the late nights at 

the library were exhausting, the 

same catered pizza at every campus 

event was bland. That won’t be the 

case for the class of 2021. We aren’t 

going to feel like we’ve outgrown 

our campus because we won’t be 

taking any moment for granted.

It’s possible that after reuniting 

with our friends, we will feel like 

the college students we were before 

the pandemic. However, given the 

scale of this event, it’s impact isn’t 

going to disappear from our daily 

lives. The landscape of Ann Arbor 

may feel different with more local 

businesses gone. We still won’t be 

at ease, being close to others in 

large groups. Our personal finances 

will be in a different place than 

expected. Sadly, some of our peers 

and 
colleagues 

will be mourning 

someone whose life 

was taken by the 

virus. 
Everything 

we do on campus 

for our final year is 

going to be at least a 

little bit different. 

It will certainly be 

filled 
with 
more 

gratitude.

Of 
course, 
we 

didn’t get to say 

goodbye 
to 
the 

seniors in the way 

we wanted to. That’s one thing 

that cannot be done over. The 

class of 2021 had the 2020 seniors 

by our side for our entire college 

experience. They are our mentors, 

role models and friends. Seeing 

their time at Michigan closed out 

abruptly without celebration felt 

personal to us. Our friends who 

we looked to for advice on future 

courses, housing and internships 

are now facing great economic 

uncertainties. We looked to them to 

watch how our future might unfold, 

and they can no longer serve as a 

guide to us. 

Thinking 
long-term, 
this 

generation, mostly Generation Z, 

is never going to forget what it was 

like to be a young person during the 

pandemic. The rapid transition to 

distanced communication and the 

uncertain future will be the same 

memory in the minds of all school-

aged young people no matter what 

grade they were in. The unique 

position of college juniors is that 

we have exactly one year left of our 

education. It feels like everything 

has fallen apart right at the end, but 

we have two semesters to piece it all 

back together again and find some 

semblance of normalcy. In 2021, 

we are going to have a graduation 

ceremony, and it won’t feel like just 

a formality.

Class of 2021, post-pandemic

Leah Adelman can be reached at 

ladelman@umich.edu.

W 

ith 
the 
current 

COVID-19 
public 

health 
crisis, 
it’s 

become particularly clear that the 

pandemic reaches beyond being 

just a highly contagious, viral 

disease or issue of community 

spread. 
The 
coronavirus 

pandemic effectively stratified 

the population into its different 

social identities and personalities 

based on the impact on specific 

communities. While the United 

States may be a melting pot, the 

virus has made evident these 

pre-existing divisions within a 

community.

These 
“new” 
categories 

or groups make us aware of 

identities and statuses we may 

not have considered within the 

standard set of “social identities.” 

We tend to consider communities 

based on where someone is 

living. Especially for millennials, 

the 
COVID-19 
public 
health 

crisis is an incredible teaching 

moment. The current state of 

the world shows us the ways 

in which disease and illness 

impact 
us 
disproportionately. 

Typically 
when 
discussing 

social 
identities, 
there’s 
the 

standard “social identity wheel.” 

This circle includes 11 sectors: 

ethnicity, 
race, 
religious 
or 

spiritual affiliation, age, physical, 

emotional, developmental ability, 

first language, national origin, 

sexual orientation, sex, gender 

and socioeconomic status. It’s 

easy to view identities as rigid 

categories when it’s important to 

instead shift and look at identities 

as a spectrum. 

Alongside the 11 identities 

listed, COVID-19 proved that 

occupation, 
encompassing 

job security and income, is an 

identity that is affected unequally. 

Additionally, whether or not 

you are essential personnel or a 

non-essential worker is another 

division brought to light due to 

COVID-19. These are examples 

of identity that, while associated 

with the socioeconomic part 

of the social identity wheel, 

aren’t always visible to the eye 

and therefore aren’t taken into 

account on a daily basis.

Another 
example 
within 

a 
global 
context 
reported 

by the Center for Strategic 

and 
International 
Studies 
is 

“The Impact of COVID-19 on 

Humanitarian 
Crises.” 
Due 

to travel restrictions, refugee 

resettlement 
programs 
are 

temporarily halted. Additionally, 

migrants and refugees are often in 

living situations that do not allow 

for social distancing to flatten the 

curve. Personally, immigration 

status is an identity that, as a U.S. 

citizen, I do not think about often. 

This is a privilege because, in this 

day and age, immigration status 

determines the level of public 

health care you’re able to receive.

Even on our campus, being 

a local business owner in Ann 

Arbor is particularly difficult 

right now because most of the 

campus community has gone 

home, and the people that are still 

in Ann Arbor are mostly staying 

at home. This means that the 

usual customers aren’t coming in 

and the unfortunate reality is that 

rent is still due on the first of the 

month. For example, welcoming 

spaces like aUM Yoga or MVMT 

which many University students 

frequently attend, are completely 

shut down. However, both studios 

are creating videos to make 

content virtually accessible to 

all. For those University students 

who are dependent on places 

like aUM or MVMT to prioritize 

both 
mental 
and 
physical 

wellness must seek this in new 

forms. There are local farms 

and produce-growers across the 

country within the agricultural 

industry 
offering 
contact-free 

curbside delivery of items that 

may no longer be available in big 

brand grocery stores. However, 

farm owners are still struggling 

to find innovative ways to sell 

their crops and produce revenue 

during this uncertain time. 

Additionally, this is a terrifying 

time for health care professionals 

fighting on the front lines against 

COVID-19. 
Now 
more 
than 

ever, the world is depending on 

health care professionals to be 

superheroes. There are doctors 

living in tents in their garages 

to prevent spreading the virus 

to their family members. There 

are pregnant ER doctors who 

risked not just their health but 

the health of their child in order 

to care for their patients with 

COVID-19. Furthermore, with 

the lack of personal protective 

equipment (PPE) available, it 

is time to re-evaluate reality — 

there is not enough support for 

our health care professionals.

Take this time to learn about 

how 
this 
pandemic 
affects 

different identities and what you 

can do to help. Look around you 

and take note of the widespread 

impacts that stretch far beyond 

the symptoms of cough, fever 

and shortness of breath. Practice 

being mindful of all identities 

and groups; we are more than 

what’s found within the social 

identity wheel. Start making a 

list of all the efforts being made 

to help health care workers and 

those affected by COVID-19. 

When we’re able to return to new 

normalcy, let’s return the support 

to 
these 
organizations 
and 

institute preventative measures 

to protect small businesses and 

health care professionals in the 

future.

To 
my 
fellow 
graduating 

seniors, 
no 
matter 
how 

heartbreaking it may be to end 

four years on such an uncertain 

note, let’s take this as a hands-

on opportunity in whatever field 

or line of study you’re pursuing 

post-graduation to learn how to 

improve the current systems in 

place. If you’re pursuing health 

care or medicine, this is the time 

to start thinking about how we 

can better deliver health care to 

all affected groups and identities. 

If you’re pursuing business, this 

is the time to find creative ways 

to fund small businesses before 

entering 
times 
of 
economic 

decline? In times of emergencies 

like these, it’s up to us to apply 

our 
University 
of 
Michigan 

educations to find ways to bridge 

these divisions.

MUSIC REVIEW

If you were a country music fan in 2014, 

you either loved, or loved to hate, Sam Hunt. 

His unabashed devotion to mashing R&B 

into country music and his clean cut, city-boy 

image made for scathing fan debate fodder. 

Whether you sang along to his clever twists 

of phrasing out loud or under your breath, 

Hunt’s music was unavoidable. Nearly every 

track on his debut album Montevallo became 

a hit. Then, for the most part, he disappeared. 

Hunt’s 
return 
with 

his sophomore effort 

Southside 
finds 
him 

with some explaining 

to do and with the 

potential 
to 
become 

even more divisive.

Despite 
having 

nearly six years to put 

it together, Southside 

is 
incredibly 
messy. 

Following up a massive 

success 
is 
tricky 

enough, and Hunt’s lack 

of commitment to any 

particular 
direction 

only exacerbates the 

problem. The result is a Frankenstein’s 

monster of an album. Not only are there 

chunks of country, pop and R&B, but songs 

released in years past have been haphazardly 

sewn onto the body of work as well. The 

project is falling apart at the seams; Southside 

feels like it’s trying to separate into two 

different albums.

The album opener “2016” is promisingly 

subdued. Hunt retraces the choices he made 

that year, now wishing he could “put the 

whiskey back in the bottle / put the smoke 

back in the joint” and devote all of 2016 to his 

longtime on-again, off-again girlfriend (now 

wife), Hannah. It’s refreshing. Hunt swaps 

his cool guy persona and heavy reliance 

on hip-hop beats for an honest, apologetic 

country sound. Logistically, “2016” is a 

useful explanation for why Southside took so 

long. Hunt has struggled a lot with fame and 

preserving his relationship — experiences 

that should amount to a substantive album.

That’s why the next track and current 

single “Hard to Forget” 

is such a let down. It’s 

irritatingly 
catchy 

radio candy. Listening 

through 
the 
album, 

one 
can’t 
help 
but 

feel duped. For every 

glimmer of hope that a 

mature and grounded 

Sam Hunt will emerge, 

there’s a song like the 

patronizing “That Ain’t 

Beautiful” that dashes 

it. The potential for a 

self-aware, 
growth-

centered album peeks 

through in Southside, 

but so does an album that’s merely trying to 

replicate his earlier Montevallo — and Hunt’s 

indecision leaves him with neither.

One throughline in Southside is that 

country fans’ genre quarrels have clearly 

gotten 
under 
Hunt’s 
skin. 
Traditional 

country instrumentation has been lathered 

over top of this R&B-driven record a bit 

unevenly. On the tail end of the otherwise 

pop heavy “Young Once,” the listener catches 

a fiddle solo. “Hard to Forget” samples the 

1953 country song “There Stands the Glass” 

by Webb Pierce. “Let It Down” pulls off 

the country R&B combination best. Hunt 

talk-raps until the chorus bursts into a 

recognizably country riff complete with 

pedal steel, dobro and banjo. 

For all of Southside’s identity crises, the 

album’s biggest head-scratcher is its inclusion 

of the track “Body Like a Back Road,” 

which was a hit two years ago. Alongside 

“Downtown’s Dead,” another single from 

2018, these tracks feel like zombies on a 

project that’s supposed to breathe new life 

into Hunt’s artistry. That’s why “Breaking 

Up Was Easy in the 90’s” elicits a sigh of 

relief. The social media savvy break up 

anthem confirms that Hunt still has it. “It” 

being the ability to smooth-talk his way into 

an infectious just-barely-country song. 

The only forgivable inclusion of an old 

Hunt song is the album closer “Drinkin’ 

Too Much.” Like “2016,” this song has 

shock-value. “I’m sorry I named the album 

Montevallo,” Hunt confesses, Montevallo 

being the name of his wife’s hometown. He 

goes on to detail their rocky relationship, 

then calls her out by name, even though he 

acknowledges that she wants her privacy. It’s 

painful and raw and unfair. Still, “Drinkin’ 

Too Much” holds the key to why Hunt’s 

country rap experiment worked in the first 

place — the genres intersect in brutally 

honest storytelling. 

With Southside, Hunt holds onto his 

titles: the first mainstream country rapper, 

the most controversial artist in Nashville 

and, yes, the “Drake of country music.” But 

he’s sloppy about it. Hopefully it won’t take 

another six years for him to get a little more 

vulnerable.

Sam Hunt’s ‘Southside’ is a monster of an album

FILM NOTEBOOK
Revisiting Hollywood and Bollywood, side by side

SABRIYA IMAMI

Daily Arts Writer

I grew up watching Bollywood movies. I sang the 

songs even though I didn’t know what I was saying, 

I did the dances despite the fact that I couldn’t (and 

still can’t) dance and I watched the stories unfold 

onscreen, enthralled by the colors, the music and the 

beauty. It wasn’t until I was older, maybe a teenager, 

when my mom burst my naive childhood perception 

of Bollywood by saying: “You know these are all 

copies of American movies, right?” No. I did not 

know that. However, once I came to that realization 

and began watching some of those American movies, 

I was shocked by how similar they were. I decided 

to rewatch some of these Hollywood and Bollywood 

pairings to compare them and see just how similar 

they were once placed side by side.

“Hitch” (2005) and “Partner” (2007)

“Partner” is by far the most obvious remake of 

its Hollywood counterpart, “Hitch.” Both feature 

a “cool guy” who fixes up a “not-so-cool guy” with 

the girl of his dreams even though she’s way out 

of his league, while simultaneously falling in love 

himself. I mean, there are some scenes that are 

exact recreations of the original: the boardroom 

scene, the whistling scene, even the scene where 

Albert (Kevin James, “Paul Blart: Mall Cop”) sprays 

water on his pants is exactly copied in “Partner” 

when the same thing happens to Bhaskar (Govinda, 

“Happy Ending”). The two films are so similar that 

the creators of “Hitch” may have threatened suit 

against the creators of “Partner.” 

There are some differences though, I’ll admit. 

For example, I don’t recall a five-minute segment of 

a missile chasing Alex (Will Smith, “Men in Black”) 

on a jet ski in “Hitch,” do you? Well, that did happen 

to Prem (Salman Khan, “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai”) in 

“Partner.” There also isn’t a mob boss who’s after 

Sara (Eva Mendes, “The Other Guys”) in “Hitch,” 

though there is one after Naina (Lara Dutta, “Don 

2”). Despite the shocking similarities — and some 

glaring differences — “Partner” is much less refined 

than “Hitch.” Salman Khan cringily swaggers 

as a “love guru,” whereas Will Smith confidently 

strides in his role of the “date doctor.” Kevin James 

thoughtfully pauses in his character’s attempt to 

win over Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta, “Gamer”), 

but Govinda thoughtlessly obsesses in his pursuit of 

Priya Jaisingh (Katrina Kaif, “Dhoom 3”). 

The characters in “Partner” feel like caricatures 

compared to their more mature and believable 

Hollywood counterparts. The whole film is a little 

ridiculous, complete with awful special effects and 

scenes that leave you in jaw-dropped horror due 

to the sheer awkwardness unfolding on screen. 

However, I’ll admit: It’s hilarious. 

“When Harry Met Sally” (1989) and “Hum 

Tum” (“Me and You,” 2004)

I know that there’s a Bollywood movie called 

“When Harry Met Sejal” that is a more obvious 

remake of the classic rom-com “When Harry Met 

Sally,” but “Hum Tum” is definitely the original 

remake. Similar to “When Harry Met Sally,” “Hum 

Tum” follows two characters who run into each 

other many times over the course of their lives 

until they fall in love. Not surprising in Bollywood, 

though, “Hum Tum” is much more unnecessarily 

dramatic than “When Harry Met Sally.” There 

were even parts of “Hum Tum” that my mom used 

to skip because she thought it would be too sad for 

us to watch. Another difference between the two 

films is that “Hum Tum” has a cartoon aspect in 

it; Karan’s (Saif Ali Khan, “Kal Ho Naa Ho”) comic 

book characters Hum and Tum fight and debate 

often on whether or not girls and boys can be just 

friends, which is of course, a common topic for 

debate in “When Harry Met Sally.” 

The relationship between Rhea (Rani Mukerji, 

“Kuch Kuch Hota Hai”) and Karan is a little more 

chaotic than Harry (Billy Crystal, “Forget Paris”) 

and Sally’s (Meg Ryan, “Sleepless in Seattle”), too. 

They “meet” more times and face more difficulties 

than their Hollywood versions because they don’t 

become friends for a while. And when they do 

become friends, Karan tries to set Rhea up with one 

of his friends, not realizing that she likes him. All in 

all, it is very dramatic. I won’t lie, though: Maybe it’s 

because I watched “Hum Tum” before I watched 

“When Harry Met Sally,” or maybe it’s because 

“Hum Tum” has some really great songs, but I like 

“Hum Tum” more. That might be blasphemous to 

Hollywood traditionalists, but I honestly don’t care. 

“John Tucker Must Die” (2006) and “Ladies 

vs. Ricky Bahl” (2011)

“John Tucker Must Die” is probably one of 

the best examples of a cliche high school rom-

com. There’s a basketball star, a cheerleader, a shy 

nobody … basically all the essentials. “Ladies vs. 

Ricky Bahl” isn’t quite like that, I’ll admit, but there 

are some huge similarities, the most prominent 

being that there are three girls who team up and 

recruit a fourth girl to get revenge on a guy. The 

biggest difference, though? In “John Tucker Must 

Die,” the male protagonist is a high school playboy, 

and in “Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl” the guy is a high-

stakes conman. So in “John Tucker,” the girls 

want revenge on John (Jesse Metcalfe, “Christmas 

Under the Stars”) because he was cheating on all 

three of them at the same time, but in “Ricky Bahl” 

the girls want to con Ricky to get their money back 

from him. 

These movies aren’t the exact same — that’s 

clear. But the endings of the films are probably 

what set them apart the most. “John Tucker” ends 

with Kate (Brittany Snow, “Pitch Perfect”) parting 

somewhat amicably with John Tucker and moving 

on to a different love interest, whereas “Ricky Bahl” 

closes with Ishika (Anushka Sharma, “Band Baja 

Baaraat”) and Ricky (Ranveer Singh, “Band Baja 

Baaraat”) beginning a genuine, con-free romantic 

relationship. These movies may be pretty different, 

but they’re similar enough that it’s hard not to draw 

comparisons between them. However, I’ll admit: 

“John Tucker Must Die” has that iconic rom com 

appeal which makes it a little more enjoyable and 

lighthearted than “Ricky Bahl.”

“Dead 
Poets 
Society” 
(1989) 
and 

“Mohabbatein” (“Love Stories,” 2000)

When I found out that people compared “Dead 

Poets Society” and “Mohabbatein,” I wasn’t sure 

that I agreed. After watching the films, I’m still 

not totally sure that I do. However, there are some 

obvious similarities that you can’t ignore. In both 

films, there is a teacher who has unconventional 

ideas and changes the lives of his students by 

teaching them to defy conformity. In “Dead 

Poets Society,” Mr. Keating (Robin Williams, 

“Mrs. Doubtfire”) teaches his students about 

individuality through literature and poetry … but 

in true Bollywood fashion, Raj Aryan (Shah Rukh 

Khan, “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham”) teaches his 

students about individuality through music and 

love. That isn’t entirely surprising, given the fact 

that the title “Mohabbatein” literally means “love 

stories.” “Dead Poets Society” is an incredible, 

meaningful film that has you sobbing by the end, 

but “Mohabbatein” is not even close to that. It’s 

three and a half hours of cheesy, forced love stories 

and very few good songs, which is what really 

makes it a Bollywood disappointment to me.

Last spring, no one could have predicted 

the economic downfall we currently find our 

country in. Meanwhile, broadcast television 

networks have been developing sitcoms based 

on the premise that everyone has extended 

family just one questionable investment or 

medical misfortune away from being forced 

to consolidate under one roof. This kind of 

uncertain economic pre-apprehension makes 

comedies like NBC’s “Indebted” and CBS’s 

“Broke” feel eerily grounded in our reality.

Even ABC has an “Extended Family Loses 

Their Fortune Forcing Multiple Families 

Under One Roof” show with “United We 

Fall,” set to premiere later this spring. These 

shows’ applicability to our current reality 

doesn’t inherently make these shows funny by 

any means, but their foresight must be worth 

something. As far as these new and suddenly 

relevant sitcom subgenres go, “Broke” probably 

has the most potential — which isn’t really 

saying much.

Marking the former “NCIS” star’s return to 

television, Pauley Perrette plays hardworking, 

bartending Jackie — the loud single mom of 

talented elementary-aged Sammy (Antonio 

Corbo, 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine”). 
Jackie’s 

childhood home is practically falling apart 

when her estranged sister Elizabeth (Natasha 

Leggero, “Another Period”) and wealthy 

husband Javier (Jamie Camil, “Jane the Virgin”) 

unexpectedly show up at her front door. Jackie 

hopes to use their sudden reappearance as an 

opportunity to ask for a loan to get back on her 

feet, but little does she know that Elizabeth and 

Javier are also broke. Don’t worry, given the 

name of the show, this isn’t a spoiler. In the pilot, 

and presumably in subsequent episodes, Javier 

learns and Elizabeth re-learns to live a life 

within new financial limits. Meanwhile they 

still deal with a personal assistant named Luis 

(Izzy Diaz, “Telenovela”) because he remains 

on Javier’s father’s payroll.

Perette’s performance should only improve 

as she settles into the kind of acting necessary 

to perform in front of a live studio audience. But, 

for that to happen, the writers will need to give 

her more to work with.

There’s a clear division between Leggero 

and Perrette’s characters that enables Perrette 

to find humor in her own. Leggero’s character 

has one of those faintly British “I only started 

speaking like this after I got money” accents as 

well as a tiny dog for her purse, while Jackie’s 

personality revolves around having a son and 

being stressed about finances.

Anyone who has seen “Jane the Virgin” 

can immediately appreciate Camil’s character 

— a toned down version of the big-hearted 

actor Rogelio de la Vega, one that fits the blue-

collar atmosphere of the show as opposed 

to the extravagant one you would get from a 

telenovela. The best character, who will surely 

get more screen time as the series progresses, is 

Javier’s assistant Luis. He’s gay, but that isn’t at 

the forefront of his character, as he circumvents 

stereotypes with cleverness. There are also 

frequent interactions between Javier and Luis 

when they speak in Spanish to each other, which 

is an added layer of realism to an otherwise 

unrelatable show.

“Broke” attempts to reflect the current 

delicacy of the economy, recognizing that the 

low unemployment rate and high stock market 

aren’t benefiting all families equally.

‘Broke’ has a relevant story, 
but that doesn’t make it good

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
Shattered dreams and new hope in ‘A Beautiful Country’

TRINA PAL

Daily Arts Writer

To Matthew Ozawa, director of the University 

production “A Beautiful Country,” the COVID-

19 pandemic has felt like “having the rug ripped 

from under you.” The intended opening night 

of “A Beautiful Country” was April 2, but, like 

so many other productions, the show has been 

canceled. 

“It’s been a crushing blow to see so many 

artists out of work and so many companies on 

the brink of closing,” Ozawa said.

“A Beautiful Country,” by playwright Chay 

Yew, would have been the fifth production that 

Ozawa, also a professional opera director, has 

directed at the University. He currently serves as 

a voice professor in the School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance. When the cast learned that University 

instruction would be shifted online, the show 

was already one month into intensive rehearsals 

six days a week, costumes were in progress and 

the production was almost completely staged. 

Ozawa is hopeful that the show can premier in 

Fall 2020, but nothing is set in stone. 

“A Beautiful Country” follows 150 years 

of Asian American history in vignettes, told 

through the eyes of Miss Visa Denied, an 

Asian male drag queen. Miss Visa Denied is a 

Malaysian Chinese immigrant, aptly named 

when his visa is denied by U.S. immigration 

authorities. The play explores this country’s 

history of xenophobia toward Asian Americans, 

assimilation and the intersecting identities 

of immigrants. In light of the COVID-19 

pandemic, these hot-button issues seem all the 

more pressing.

“COVID-19 was detrimental to what we 

were trying to show,” Music, Theatre & Dance 

sophomore Morgan Bo, an acting major cast as 

the body of Miss Visa 

Denied, said. 

The 
show 
details 

xenophobia 
against 

Asian Americans, and 

clear parallels are seen in 

the COVID-19 pandemic 

today. 
Hate 
crimes 

against Asian Americans 

have been on the rise 

over the past month. Bo 

pointed out that racial 

homogenization between 

Asian Americans and 

Asian immigrants has 

increased as well, as 

is often the case when 

a 
particular 
minority 

group becomes a target 

of racism.

“I’ve 
only 
heard 

stories like this in history 

books,” Bo said. “It says 

something about how we, 

as a world, haven’t grown 

to love each other.”

“A Beautiful Country” 

is deeply personal for Ozawa, whose father was 

raised in a Japanese internment camp during 

World War II. For him, the COVID-19 pandemic 

feels like a repeat of history. He’s scared about 

what the U.S. will look like after the pandemic 

blows over, and fears for his safety and that of 

other Asian Americans. 

“I’m sometimes shocked by how little our 

country has evolved and how we continue 

to make the same mistakes,” Ozawa said. 

“This pandemic is only 

heightening feelings that 

have existed for a quite a 

while.

Immigrants 
are 

largely 
characterized 

by their racial identity, 

often because it’s the 

most visible. But “A 

Beautiful 
Country” 

recognizes that there’s 

so much more to any 

immigrant. Miss Visa 

Denied 
has 
a 
racial 

identity as East Asian, 

a cultural identity as 

Malaysian and a gender 

identity as a male drag 

queen, among others. 

“(Immigrants) 
are 

caught 
between 
two 

continents, two cultures, 

two 
languages, 
two 

homes,” Ozawa said. 

Ozawa chose to split 

up Miss Visa Denied 

into three parts — the 

body, the voice and the soul — to show that 

immigrants can’t be homogenized into black-

and-white groups. Yet, immigrants aren’t 

writing the history of our nation, and their 

stories aren’t taught in K-12 schools. 

“Who are we listening to, and what’s being 

left out?” Ozawa said.

Bo, like Ozawa, identifies as Asian American, 

and feels strongly that this show deserves 

to be shown, especially in light of current 

circumstances. In assuming the role of Miss 

Visa Denied’s body, Bo focused on learning how 

to dress hyper-feminine and dance in vogue. 

“I learned a ridiculous amount about myself 

and my identity through playing this character,” 

Bo said. “Things were clicking, but I was 

definitely still learning as I was going.”

The messages of “A Beautiful Country” were 

special for everyone involved in the production, 

and the cast is devastated that their production 

is canceled for the foreseeable future. 

“We were creating something that was not 

only important, but was created with care,” 

Ozawa said, who made extra efforts to ensure 

rehearsal spaces were safe, comfortable and 

afforded a sense of agency for the cast. 

Yet, in the midst of this chaos, there’s still 

optimism and hope.

“When things start to restore, we as a society 

need the arts,” Ozawa said. “The arts will have 

a huge responsibility to restore our sense of 

being.” 

The pandemic may be keeping us at home, but 

this idle time is ripe for creativity and creation. 

“People have such creative minds right 

now,” Bo said. “People are going to want to do 

something where they don’t feel like they’re 

locked in. I do believe theatre will have that 

rejuvenation and renaissance period.”

Can the performing arts recover from the 

blows of this pandemic? Bo remains optimistic. 

“The theatre industry is shifting toward a 

new light,” Bo said. “A better light, hopefully.”

The concert hall on 
the computer screen

As a high school student, I remember asking my 

friends if they’d be interested in coming with me to 

various classical music concerts. We’d dress nicely 

— not too nicely, of course — and sit in the faraway 

student-ticket sections of incredibly high-end 

concert venues. We’d turn off our cell phones and 

disconnect from our Internet-based high school 

lives. It was the only occasion in which we would 

choose to forget about social media and virtual 

interaction for hours at a time.

Back then, in the era before digital wellness 

became technology companies’ newest selling 

point, I wasn’t as conscious of the battle between 

the performing arts and the cell phone. I had 

witnessed the occasional pre-concert reminder to 

turn off my cell phone, of course, but that hadn’t 

become part of the concert ritual. And I hadn’t ever 

witnessed a concert designed for Internet viewers 

or social media posts.

Over the next six or seven years, I watched the 

cell phone come into conflict with the performing 

arts. First there were the musicians who stopped 

playing when ringtones interrupted their chains 

of thought. Then there were the actors who 

called out audience members for recording their 

performances, sometimes even weaponizing 

ushers as a means of ensuring they didn’t end up 

online.

Artists began to describe the fight against cell 

phones as a desire to control how their artistic 

work is shared and consumed. They didn’t want 

unauthorized recordings to make it to the Internet 

— they didn’t want to discourage people from 

buying tickets. And in many cases, artists said cell 

phones distracted them from producing their best 

work. These practices were strongly discouraged 

but never expressly banned.

However, at a performance by Hasan Minhaj 

last year at the Michigan Theater, I had my first 

experience with a mandatory cell phone ban — I 

had my phone locked in a magnetically-sealed 

pouch at the door to enter the theater. This was a 

precaution, Minhaj’s production company claimed, 

meant to ensure that none of the jokes from his 

upcoming show ended up online. It was the only 

way that he felt comfortable trying out new jokes 

and new ways of telling these jokes.

While I could understand this rationale, it 

felt more punitive to me than preventative. Had 

the trust between artists and audience members 

completely disappeared? Were comedians this 

distrustful of their fans, that to prevent an errant 

joke from becoming a Twitter trend they were 

forced to lock away our cell phones?

And what did this say about the human 

condition, about our constant need to record and 

digitize our experiences? I remember sitting with 

a friend before the event started, trying to make 

small talk in a time we both knew would normally 

be spent in our respective digital spheres. The cell 

phone had begun to encroach on the sanctity of the 

performance; during intermissions playbills were 

gradually replaced with my cell phone. 

Yet at that performance, I enjoyed not having 

the ability to check my phone between acts. I loved 

talking to my friend about it afterward, neither of 

us feeling any pressure to immediately re-enter 

our digital lives once the entertainment had ended. 

And I began to wonder if Minhaj acted in our 

best interest. Were we becoming addicted to our 

phones — addicted to the point that they needed 

to be locked away from us if we wanted to enjoy 

a concert? Was the locking of our phones just as 

much in our interest as it was the artist’s?

The play explores this 

country’s history of 

xenophobia toward Asian 
Americans, assimilation 

and the intersecting 

identities of immigrants. 
In light of the COVID-
19 pandemic, these hot-
