About 50 students and faculty 
convened Tuesday evening in 
the 
Rackham 
Amphitheatre 
for the 2nd annual King Talks, 
a TED-talk style lecture. The 
event is part of the weeklong 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. Symposium celebration, 
which 
included 
a 
keynote 
lecture and more than 20 other 
events. The King Talks event 
featured four graduate student 
speakers 
who 
shared 
how 
their work and life experiences 
related to the legacy of Dr. King.
Rackham 
student 
Paul 
Artale, 
organizer 
of 
the 
event, explained the speeches 
responding 
to 
the 
MLK 

Symposium theme of “unravel” 
were the product of months 
of work starting when the 
speakers applied in October.
During her talk, Rackham 
student 
Aunrika 
Tucker-
Shabazz told the story of 
Takovia Allen, a 3-foot-9-inch, 
50 
pound, 
6-year-old 
with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder who was subdued 
by 
three 
police 
officers 
and 
charged 
with 
battery 
and assault for kicking her 
kindergarten aide in the ankle. 
Tucker-Shabazz 
revealed 
Takovia’s story is not unique, as 
Black girls are routinely more 
harshly punished for the same 
behavior compared to white 
girls, and at higher rates.

Students, alumni, faculty and 
staff unraveled their life stories 
to the Value the Voice audience 
Tuesday night at the Helmut Stern 
Auditorium at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art.
A joint effort between the 
Comprehensive Studies Program, 
the Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, and the 
UMMA brought a crowd of 80 
to listen to stories relating to 
identity. This is third Moth-style 
storyteller lounge event of Value 
the Voice series.
The event, called “Value the 
Voice: Unravel,” consisted of 
stories on the call to political 
activism, navigating being a first 
year student, #BBUM’s five-year 
anniversary, Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s vision through community 
service, identity as a mixed person 
on campus, mental health issues 
through the You Good Fam 
student organization and gender 
identity.
The 
storytelling 
event 
showcases a range of human 
experiences 
of 
marginalized 
peoples and their life stories.
LSA 
freshman 
Monique 
Wheeler discussed the challenges 
of 
adapting 
to 
the 
campus 
environment as someone from 
an environment she described as 
“sheltered” because there were 
more Black people. She described 
how her initial encounter was 
different from what she had 
anticipated 
for 
college 
and 
found herself “isolated.” In the 

Black community, Wheeler was 
criticized for “sounding white” 
in high school. When she came to 
the University, she said she found 
the culture shock to be greater 
than she expected. Wheeler said 
no one would talk to her and her 
roommate.
“Anytime anyone looked at me, 
I was that Black girl,” Wheeler 
said.
Wheeler shared a poem she had 
written for her creative writing 
class. In it, she expressed her fear 
of being attacked at any time and 
said nobody would listen to her.
“When my eyes meet yours, 
I feel the fear entangling itself … 
for I feel forever alienated in this 

place where I’m supposed to find 
myself,” Wheeler said. “ ... The 
truth is, I have no friends here 
because I do not belong.”
Apart from Wheeler, LSA 
Curriculum Coordinator Simon 
Rivers and Public Health senior 
Lloyd Lyons talked about their 
experiences as Black people, 
reminding the audience about the 
legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.
Angelo Bunker, a senior at 
Wayne State University, attended 
the event but said he did not find it 
appealed to his interests.
“It wasn’t necessarily my cup 
of tea, but I do appreciate being 
able to hear everyone’s stories no 
matter how personal they were,” 

Bunker said.
LSA freshman Jannet Avra 
commented more positively about 
the opportunity to learn more 
about the experiences of others on 
campus.
“It definitely puts you in good 
feelings,” Avra said. “I’m just 
glad that I got to hear everyone’s 
stories.”
LSA freshman Jordan Smith 
said she liked how hearing 
speakers’ 
stories 
fostered 
a 
connection between her and them. 
“Being able to relate to other 
people gives you a sense of 
community within the campus 
so (I) think there’s some value in 
that,” Smith said.

Tuesday night, Ann Arbor City 
Council introduced an ordinance 
to amend city trespassing laws.
The amended ordinance, which 
is a project of the Ann Arbor Police 
Department and Human Rights 
Commission, will require that 
individuals on property without 
lawful authority to be there 
receive a warning before being 
cited or arrested for trespassing. 
In addition, the new ordinance 
would give more control to the 
city, rather than the county, over 
trespassing cases.
After the introduction of the 
ordinance, councilmembers and 
residents shared concerns about 
the potential abusiveness of the 
measure.
Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3, spoke to 
clarify the ordinance. She 
addressed resident concerns 
about what they see as the 
punitive nature of the new 
ordinance. Grand, along with 
Councilmember Ali Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5, serves as a liaison 
between the council and the 
Human Rights Commission.

A group of six students and

led 
anti-racism 
teach-in 
Tuesday evening to discuss 
ways to combat racial intol-

LSA sophomore Adeoluwa

MESA for two years, said 

the teach-in is more neces-
sary now than in previous 
years because of the grow-

and racially charged lan-
guage 
in 
national

SK Y HIGH IN COLOR ADO

ON THE DAILY: LIST SAYS ANN ARBOR THE PLACE TO GO FOR A CUP OF JOE

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: STUDENTS SIT IN TO 
PROTEST RESEARCH

For those who require a 
daily fix of coffee, Ann Arbor 
is one of the best places to 
be, according to a ranking 
from ApartmentGuide.com. 
Ann Arbor made it as one of 
the top cities on Apartment 
Guide’s Top 10 Best Cities 

for Coffee Lovers list.
Apartment 
Guide 
credited 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
plethora of coffee shops in 
part to the University of 
Michigan, due to its high 
student 
enrollment 
and 
professor 
count. 
Coffee 
shops are a popular study 
destination for some, and 
give 
students 
a 
much-

needed coffee buzz to stay 
up late studying, according 
to Apartment Guide.
Ann Arbor is home to 37 
coffee shops. According to 
the graphic on Apartment 
Guide’s list, that’s one coffee 
shop 
per 
2,825 
people. 
These 37 coffee shops offer 
a variety of vibes, from 
more mainstream chains 

like 
Starbucks 
to 
local 
favorites like Roos Roast or 
Comet Coffee.
Though Ann Arbor is 
ranked as No.10 on the list, 
it beat out 40 other cities 
considered by Apartment 
Guide. Coffee connoisseurs: 
Ann Arbor coffee shops may 
be the place for you. 

January 23, 1991
Thirty-five 
students 
began occupying an office 
in the Institute for Social 
Research (ISR) yesterday 
to “expose the University’s 
efforts to deceive us about 
its 
role 
in 
developing 
genocidal 
weapons,” 
according to a statement 
released by the group.
The 
occupation, 
scheduled to last 24 hours 
and organized by U of M 
Students Against U. S> 
Intervention in the Middle 
East (SAUSI), began at 
noon when the protesters 

entered the Division of 
Research Development and 
Administration 
(DRDA) 
office on the second floor 
of the ISR.
SAUSI 
informed 
University 
President 
James Duderstadt and Ann 
Arbor Police late Monday 
night of their plans, to 
assure th em of their non-
violent intentions.
The group did not release 
the time and location of 
the 
sit-in 
until 
Daniel 
Kohns, publicity chair and 
SAUSI committee member, 
revealed the information 

at the press conference 
at 
the 
Cube 
moments 
after students entered the 
building.
The aims of the sit-in 
include the following:
To 
encourage 
the 
University not to aid in 
the prosecution of student 
resisters in the event of a 
draft.
To 
persuade 
the 
University 
to 
redirect 
its resources away from 
research and development 
of 
“weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction” 
and 
to 
increase the accessibility 

of 
higher 
education 
to 
people 
of 
color 
and 
the 
economically 
disenfranchised. 
To 
gain 
access 
to 
information regarding the 
extent of the University’s 
involvement 
in 
military 
research and development.
The student occupying 
the 
building 
did 
not 
encounter any resistance 
upon 
entering 
as 
they 
settled in the spacious 
office 
of 
Alan 
Steiss, 
director 
of 
DRDA. 
Protesters said Steiss was 
very accomodating.

CSG discusses potential new ‘U’ student 
housing, new educational values 

Represenatives talk Board of Regents’ purchase of 24.6 acres on 5th Ave, E. Madison St.

ELIZABETH LAWRENCE
Managing News Editor

The University of Michigan 
Central Student Government 
discussed adopting a set of 
undergraduate 
education 
values 
established 
by 
a 
University task force and 
a possible location for new 
student housing at a meeting 
Tuesday evening.
Kevin 
Jiang, 
a 
former 
assembly member and 2018 
alum, spoke to the Student 
Assembly regarding a new 
value set to describe the 
mission of the University’s 
entire 
undergraduate 
education 
program. 
According to Jiang, the task 

force wants more student 
input in the list of values to 
ensure the values reflect the 
beliefs of the University.
“We want to first put out 
a set of values that we want 
our university to live by when 
it comes to undergraduate 
education,” 
Jiang 
said. 
“Second, we want to put out 
a set of challenges that our 
undergraduate population is 
faced with now, and third, we 
are trying to figure out what 
the various pilot programs 
on campus that are already 
living by those values are.”
Values on the initiative 
currently 
being 
proposed 
include “brave exploration, 

greater 
good, 
purposeful 
inclusion, 
collaborative 
spirit, well-being and self-
determination.” 
Jiang 
emphasized 
the 
task 
force’s efforts to work with 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services 
to 
include 
more 
clinical counselors on North 
Campus.
Members of the Assembly 
were given the opportunity 
to respond to the suggested 
value set. Rackham student 
Austin 
Glass 
suggested 
including 
“community 
expansion” as an additional 
value.
“I 
think 
it’s 
worth 
evaluating whether or not 
you 
include 
something 
about 
expanding 
our 
community,” 
Glass 
said. 
“One of the problems the 
University faces now is not 
being representative of the 
state of Michigan … I think 
it’s worth expanding it.”
The 
assembly 
later 
discussed the University’s 
Board of Regents’ recent 
purchase of the former 
location 
of 
Fingerle 
Lumber. The 6.54 acres 
of 
land 
was 
purchased 
on Dec. 6 for $24 million 
after 
Fingerle 
Lumber 
announced 
its 
closing 
earlier that month. The 
land 
is 
located 
along 
Fifth Ave. and south of E. 
Madison St. Although the 
Board of Regents has not 
announced what they plan 
to do with the land, the 
location was discussed as 
a possible location for new 
student housing.
CSG 
Vice 
President 
Izzy 
Baer 
mentioned 
the lack of demand for 
student 
housing 
among 
upperclassmen. She said 

because many sophomores 
are more interested in off-
campus housing, building a 
new dorm may not appeal to 
upperclassmen.

“I’m 
skeptical 
if 
there 
is a need for sophomores 
to 
continue 
living 
with 
on-campus housing versus 
making this a more apartment 
style, 
non-dorm 
concept,” 
Baer said.
Law student Kevin Deutsch 
also 
explained 
his 
own 
experience with the location.

“I 
live 
right 
behind 
Fingerle Lumber, and not 
only are there train tracks 
there but trains come in at 
three in the morning, and 
they are very loud,” Deutsch 
said. “The actual streets are 
not designed very well to 
handle the traffic that a dorm 
would bring.”
For the location to be a 
possible 
place 
of 
student 
housing, 
the 
Assembly 
discussed implementing new 
bus routes, creating safety 
standards regarding the train 
tracks and the possibility of 
marketing the dorm toward 
athletes, as it is close to South 
Campus.

It’s worth 
evaluating whether 
or not you include 
something about 
expanding our 
community.


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Wednesday, January 23, 2019 — 3A

To 
explore 
the 
implications 
of 
this 
disciplinary 
disparity, 
Tucker-Shabazz compared 
classroom punishment to 
charges on a bank account, 
drawing the metaphor that 
positive behavior increases 
a student’s balance.
“This is a hidden fee, but 
this is also a steep fee that 
young Black girls are paying 
for the same misconduct,” 
Tucker-Shabazz 
said. 
“One part of the story is 
that Black girls and other 
children are not starting 
at the same balance, but 
they’re also having deficits 
and withdrawals from their 
account 
more 
frequently 
than other populations and 
at a faster rate, and no one is 
talking about it.”
According 
to 
Tucker-
Shabazz, 
however, 
zero-
tolerance policies are often 
prejudiced 
with 
“hidden 
fees” 
for 
Black 
girls, 
creating a ripple effect on 
their academic possibilities, 
future careers and overall 
life outcomes.
“(The 
zero-tolerance 
policy) holds them back in 
the short-term, in K-12,” 
Tucker-Shabazz 
said. 
“But they are also more 
likely to not graduate high 
school or college on time 
… to be unemployed or 
underemployed more than 
any other population, and 
more likely to report mental 
illness.”
Tucker-Shabazz 
elaborated on stereotypical 
depictions of Black women 
as animalistic and angry, 
using 
examples 
from 

children 
books 
to 
show 
these 
characterizations 
begin 
during 
girlhood. 
Such perceptions, Tucker-
Shabazz 
claimed, 
lead 
adults to view and treat 
young 
Black 
girls 
like 
adults, resulting in harmful 
consequences.
“Starting at age 5… (Black 
girls) are more likely than 
white girls to be perceived as 
older, as having more carnal 
knowledge of the body, as 
being more aggressive in 
their 
behavior,” 
Tucker-
Shabazz 
said. 
“They’re 
more sexualized than any 
other child in the classroom 
… We see Black girls as non-
members of children, and 
we see them as adults. So we 
actually punish them, as a 
result, as adults.”

Next, 
Rackham 

student 
Shannon 
Moran 
discussed 
the 
link 
between 
mentorship 
and 
representation by sharing 
her experience as a mentor 
for other LGBTQ women in 
STEM. She then looked at 
research on the importance 
of mentorship and visibility 
for other underrepresented 
populations such as Blacks 
and Hispanics in STEM. 
In particular, Moran noted 
that she had no such data on 
mentorship in the LGBTQ 
community. 
“(Studies 
on 
LGBTQ 
mentorship) do not exist,” 
Moran said. “But I’m not 
about to wait around for 
a study that shows that 
LGBTQ mentorship works 
in STEM to start doing what 
I know works. I’m not an 
expert … but I do know how 
to share my experience.”

“It could be interpreted, and 
it has been by some residents, 
that we’re trying to make 
our 
trespass 
harsher, 
that 
we’re trying to make it more 
punitive,” Grand said. “When 
in fact, bringing trespass into 
the city’s ordinance was a 
result of the work of the Ann 
Arbor Police Department and 
the Human Rights Council.”
Ramlawi 
echoed 
Grand’s 
statements 
and 
shared 
he 
initially 
had 
reservations 
about passing the ordinance, 
too. However, Ramlawi said 
he now believes the new 
ordinance will be beneficial in 
handling these cases.
“It does not change the 
ordinance itself, but the policy 
procedures of enforcement,” 
Ramlawi said. “I think it 
expands the civil rights of 
folks and it does not take away 
more.”
AAPD Interim Chief Robert 
Pfannes explained the need 
for the new ordinance came 
from a realization within 
the police department that 
many individuals convicted of 
trespassing are often repeat 
offenders and suffer from 
mental illness. He stated that, 
with the current trespass 
process 
mandating 
mailed 
court dates, it is difficult for 
the many homeless offenders 
to 
receive 
important 
documents when they don’t 
have a permanent address.
“It’s a way for them to 
access resources, to not get 
deeper 
into 
the 
criminal 
justice system, and there’s 
no 
downside 
from 
an 
enforcement 
angle 
either,” 
Pfannes said.
The proposed amendment 
comes about a year after 
a 
16-year-old 
Black 
teen 
was 
arrested 
at 
Blake 
Transit Center for allegedly 
trespassing. The 2017 arrest 
drew severe criticism from 
the public for the officer’s 
use of force when arresting 
the Ann Arbor high school 
student and for citing the 
student with trespass when 
he claimed to be waiting for 
the bus.
Several Ann Arbor residents 
also 
voiced 
concerns 
over 
pedestrian 
and 
vehicle 
accidents. Pedestrian safety 
has been a consistent topic 
of debate. Members of the 
local citizen group A2 Safe 
Transport 
attended 
the 
meeting and urged the council 
to 
make 
improvements 
to 
crosswalks.

According 
to 
Claire 
Duvernoy, 
an 
A2 
Safe 
Transport member, there have 
been three pedestrians injured 
in the past three weeks at 
crosswalks in Ann Arbor.
“We are at a crisis in 
perspective 
to 
pedestrian 
safety,” Duvernoy said. “We 
need to have a comprehensive 
review of all crosswalks in Ann 
Arbor.”
Barbara Clark, the mother 
of a 17-year-old driver who 
critically injured a 21-year-old 
male University of Michigan 
student last week, also spoke 
on pedestrian safety. Clark 
expressed her apologies to the 
family of the student injured 
by her son and joined other 
residents in demanding the 
council devote more resources 
to improving crosswalks.
“I’m not here to revisit the 
accident,” Clark said. “I’m 
here because I don’t want 
another pedestrian injured 
or killed, or their family to 
experience the devastation 
this family is feeling, and I 
don’t want another driver to 
experience the guilt my son 
feels.”
Councilmember 
Kathy 
Griswold, D-Ward 2, discussed 
some of the pedestrian safety 

concerns made during public 
comments 
and 
mentioned 
the new crosswalk guidelines 
that were released Tuesday. 
The designs were created in 
response to resident concerns 
of 
inconsistencies 
among 
crosswalks.
“First I want to thank 
the staff for the crosswalk 
design guidelines that were 
just issued — that is a major 
improvement 
in 
crosswalk 
safety,” Griswold said. “I will 
be working with staff over 
the next couple of weeks, 
and I will be introducing a 
formal resolution of specific 
action items that will make 
crosswalks 
safer 
for 
all 
roadway users.”

“With the recent trend that is hap-
pening in America, you have this 
popularity of hate statements to-
ward Latinx people, you have this 
popularity of hate statements to-
ward immigrants,” Ijidakinro said. 
“In this time, especially with our 
current administration, I feel that 
this teach-in about anti-racism is 
needed now more than ever.”
Ijidakinro said he and LSA junior 
Shaima Abdullah, another student 
leader within MESA, chose to fo-
cus the teach-in on contemporary 
racial issues in addition to the his-
tory of racism in the United States 
to show how past events directly 
impact current prejudices.
“I do think that the majority of 
people think that the civil rights 
era has ended, and you think of the 

Martin Luther King era, but when 
we show students what’s occurred 
recently on campus to compare to 
the history, they’re seeing the simi-
larities and it’s just proof that civil 
rights hasn’t ended,” Ijidakinro 
said.
During the event, Abdullah and 
Ijidakinro led numerous activities, 
including filling in a timeline of 
racism in the U.S. and completing a 
worksheet on the “Four ‘I’s of op-
position,” in order to generate con-
versation regarding one’s influence 
on systemic issues such as racism 
and inequity. The Four Is of oppo-
sition, which include institutional, 
ideological, interpersonal and in-
ternalized, urged students to real-
ize change can occur through both 
group and individual actions.
Engineering junior Bhavin Gandhi, 
a residential adviser for Univer-
sity Housing, said a lawsuit filed 

against the U-M Bias Response 
Team in May 2018 often restricts 
his ability as an RA to protect his 
residents from hate speech in 
dorms. After the University re-
sponded to the lawsuit by claiming 
University policies do not infringe 
upon free speech, RAs are no lon-
ger allowed to erase slurs or racist 
symbols from whiteboards outside 
students’ rooms.
During the teach-in, students re-
flected on how they challenge rac-
ism and inequality in their daily 
lives through student organiza-
tions or activism. Gandhi said his 
role as an RA gives him the oppor-
tunity to both challenge his innate 
biases and confront them by help-
ing other students navigate life at 
the University.
“Personally, my biases are one thing 
I’m trying to realize a bit more, and 
also educating people who I know 

didn’t have the best upbringing,” 
Gandhi said. “For example, a lot 
of my residents who are of color 
didn’t know how to do the FAFSA 
when they were applying to col-
lege. That’s something I’m trying 
to help a little bit more with — the 
things that I learned as a person of 
color for college management.”
Abdullah stressed the need for 
students to educate themselves 
on how their personal actions and 
words can oppose racism.
“(We should be) educating our-
selves, 
continuously 
reading, 
whether that’s becoming more 
aware of our language and the 
speech we’re using and how that 
impacts people, or even what orga-
nizations we’re a part of and how 
we want to continuously make 
not just personal changes in our 
lives, but structural changes too 
in society,” Abdullah said. 

Between 
 
Jan. 
13 
and 18, more than 50 
eateries around the city 
featured 
tasting 
menus 
to celebrate the 10th Ann 
Arbor Restaurant Week. 
Organized by the Main 
Street Area Association, 
the 
biannual 
event 
is 
an opportunity for Ann 
Arbor locals and students 
to sample dishes that the 
city has to offer at a low 
price. 
Most 
restaurants 
offer lunch options for $15 
with multiple courses and 
a $28 three course dinner 
menu, with roughly half 
the participating dinner 
destinations 
enticing 
customers with a two-
for-one deal. Restaurants 
participating 
ranged 
from 
more 
expensive 
establishments 
such 
as 
Black Pearl and Pacific 
Rim to more casual spots 
like The Original Cottage 
Inn 
and 
Afternoon 
Delight.
Adam Baru, owner and 
operator 
of 
three 
Ann 
Arbor establishments — 
Mani Osteria, Isalita and 
most recently, Mikette — 
said although Restaurant 
Week does not typically 
generate as much revenue 
at 
his 
restaurants 
as 
normal 
nights, 
it 
is 
a 
useful 
marketing 
tool, 
which helps to attract new 
customers 
and 
provide 
current eaters with more 
affordable options.
“I’ve 
always 
looked 
at 
Restaurant 
Week 
(as) one of the biggest 
opportunities to market 
the 
restaurants 
and 
to 
expose people who don’t 
know about them because 
there are still many people 
who have never eaten at 
some of our restaurants, 
so it’s a great opportunity 
for them to come in,” 
Baru said. “But it is also 
for people who do know 

about it to try things that 
they 
typically 
wouldn’t 
because (of ) the value of 
the promotion.”
Baru said the winter 
Restaurant 
Week 
is 
generally more successful 
than the event’s summer 
week because of the vast 
presence of students in the 
Ann Arbor community.
“The January Restaurant 
Week is always the most 
popular and one of the 
reasons why is because 

the 
students 
are 
here 
whereas in the summer 
they are not often times,” 
Baru said. “It’s a great 
deal to be able to do this 
for not only people who 
live in town, but also this 
massive community that is 
the University … We want 
to make it a pretty low 
barrier entry, so whether 
you are a student or you 
are a family who maybe 
doesn’t dine out so often.”
Kinesiology 
senior 

Paulina 
Vokulich, 
who 
ate 
at 
Slurping 
Turtle 
and Pacific Rim by Kana 
during the week, agreed 
with 
Baru’s 
sentiments 
about 
the 
increased 
affordability of dining out 
during Restaurant Week 
and said she thoroughly 
appreciates the event for 
that very reason.
“It’s definitely nice for 
the students to go out and 
have a more affordable 
experience at a lot of 

places,” Vokulich said.
LSA 
sophomore 
Allison 
Weisenfeld 
is 
the 
marketing 
director 
of the U-M branch of 
Spoon 
University, 
a 
college student-run food 
publication. 
Weisenfeld 
echoed 
Vokulich’s 
excitement 
regarding 
Restaurant Week.
“I think it’s a really 
awesome 
opportunity 
to get students to really 
go out and explore new 

restaurants in Ann Arbor 
because 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
students feel like they are 
too busy or don’t want 
to go out for financial or 
education reasons, but it 
gives them an excuse to 
try new restaurants and 
explore 
the 
downtown 
area,” Vokulich said.
Weisenfeld 
explained 
she 
dined 
at 
several 
Ann Arbor eateries this 
past 
Restaurant 
Week, 
including Nagomi and The 
Chop House where she 
enjoyed her inexpensive 
meals.
“(The) Chop House was 
so good because obviously 
(it) is insanely expensive, 
but because each person 
was only $28 you were 
able to get steak, salad 
and a really fancy dessert 
and still got the same 
steakhouse 
experience,” 
Weisenfeld said. “I felt 
that it was a really great 
deal and it was really fun 
for a date night. I was able 
to go with my boyfriend to 
a nice restaurant that was 
fairly affordable.”
Vokulich 
also 
praised 
Restaurant Week because 
of its low costs and its 
communal value.
“It 
brings 
community 
spirit 
(to 
Ann 
Arbor) 
because it makes it more 
fun to go somewhere if 
you know there is an event 
going on,” Vokulich said.
Baru 
agreed 
with 
Vokulich, 
noting 
that 
participation in Restaurant 
Week is minimally about 
money and predominantly 
about community.
“Our mission is to serve 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
our 
classic menu items and to 
not really worry about the 
fact that we may not make 
as much money that we 
normally would, because 
the idea is to participate 
in something that is truly 
about 
the 
community,” 
Baru said.

I’m not here 
to revisit the 
accident. I’m here 
because I don’t 
want another 
pedestrian killed.

LSA 
junior 
Yara 
El-Tawil 
worked as a research assistant at 
the Rogel Cancer Center and was 
required to download Duo Two-
Factor 
Authentication. 
While 
El-Tawil understands the need for 
cybersecurity, she does not believe 
Duo is necessary for students like 
her who do not have sensitive 
information on their University 
accounts.
“For me, it doesn’t make a lot 
of sense to have to use Duo since I 
have almost nothing on my account 
that’s in danger of identity theft or 
anything like that,” El-Tawil said. 
“But I guess since there’s been a lot 
of data leaks and stuff, the safest 
thing to do is just to go through 
all of it, regardless … because 
then you have a blanket, you can’t 
compromise any other accounts. 
But also it’s just really annoying. It 
makes sense, it’s just unfortunate.”

LSA sophomore Joey Pongrac 
said he agrees. He waited until 
the morning of Jan. 22 to install 
the Two-Factor Authentication. 
Pongrac works at the Science 
Learning Center as a facilitator 
for organic chemistry classes and 
believes the system is of no value to 
him since he is not concerned about 
individuals hacking his account.
“They said it makes my account 
more secure, but I’m not really 
worried about anyone hacking 
into my account in the first place,” 
Pongrac said. “It was pretty easy 
to install and it wasn’t a big deal. 
It took like five minutes. It’s what 
I expected, it’s just a waste of time, 
but it’s fine I guess.”
DePriest Dockins, director of 
Identity and Access Management 
at 
the 
University, 
said 
the 
introduction 
of 
Two-Factor 
Authentication was not due to 
any specific instance of security 
breaches in the University, but 
rather was due to the risk having 

minimal 
cybersecurity 
poses. 
Two-Factor Authentication was 
one of the easiest ways to ensure 
cybersecurity at the University, 
Dockins said.
“Two-Factor 
Authentication, 
as it turns out, is one of the most 
straightforward things you can 
do to protect the University’s 
resources,” Dockins said. “It’s 
something you know — so your 
uniqname and password — and 
something you have, which is 
a code or your mobile device. 
So somebody has to have all of 
those things in order to get into a 
resource.”
To 
turn 
on 
Two-Factor 
Authentication, University staff 
has to go to duo.it.umich.edu. 
Those looking to install Duo can 
download the Duo Mobile app onto 
their phone and tap the University 
of Michigan account to get a 
passcode. The next step is to select 
“send me a push,” which will send 
an authentication request to their 

device. They will then unlock their 
phone, open the push notification 
and tap the green button to 
approve.
El-Tawil said the process of 
downloading Duo was relatively 
simple, 
though 
logging 
in 
presented a problem when she was 
unable to access her smartphone 
and the seven-day verification 
expired. 
Users 
can 
check 
“Remember me for 7 days” so they 
do not have to authorize the Two-
Factor Authentication each time 
they log on, as long as they use the 
same device and browser, and the 
browser does not block cookies.
“(The program) gave you steps 
to follow, and so it wasn’t hard per 
se, it was just annoying to get used 
to,” El-Tawil said. “If I was logging 
onto something without my phone 
there, or if my phone was dead, it 
would just be a hassle to charge it if 
the seven-day verification was off. 
That was the biggest problem — 
was not having my phone.”

What the Empowered Arab Sisterhood has done for me

MARIA ULAYYET | COLUMN

C

ulture shock.

For the first time in 

my life, I finally knew 

and felt what those two words 

really meant. As I walked 

into that lecture hall in the 

Chemistry Building on the first 

day of my freshman orientation, 

I felt like an alien. I desperately 

looked 
around 
the 
packed 

auditorium 
to 
find 
another 

person of color, to find someone 

even remotely like me, even if it 

were just in our shared feeling 

of being different.

During the last month at 

home between my orientation 

and my move-in day, I dreaded 

having to go back to Ann Arbor. 

Everyone had made friends at 

orientation and was relieved to 

be leaving home, but I couldn’t 

relate. I was scared. I felt so 

alone 
during 
my 
three-day 

orientation. I couldn’t believe 

that the joy of the moment 

of going away to an amazing 

school, a moment I had been 

waiting for for years, had been 

so discreetly stolen away from 

me.

As both the oldest child 

and oldest girl in my Arab 

immigrant family, going away 

for college had been out of the 

question until my junior year. 

My parents told me if I could 

get into a good school, I could 

move out for college. Seeing 

my hard work as a student go 

to waste was my greatest fear. 

With limited help from my 

school and no help from my 

family, I tried to figure out the 

ACT, SAT, Common Application 

and other college application 

materials. So when I got into 

the 
University 
during 
my 

senior year, I felt like I finally 

succeeded. Little did I know 

that the struggles for me were 

just now beginning.

As 
a 
first-generation 

American, 
first-generation 

college student and an Arab-

Muslim 
woman, 
I 
quickly 

realized that, as I sank into 

my seat in the corner of that 

auditorium in the Chemistry 

Building, 
the 
odds 
weren’t 

really in my favor.

Who could I relate to here? 

Who would I be friends with? 

Who was I going to study with? 

Who was I going to spend the 

alleged “best years” of my life 

with?

Enter 
Epsilon 
Alpha 

Sigma — better known as the 

Empowered Arab Sisterhood 

— the first and only nationally 

recognized 
predominantly-

Arab sorority. Nearly a year and 

a half later, with my 14 sisters 

by my side, I can finally say 

the University has become my 

second home. I never pegged 

myself for the sisterhood type, 

let alone a “sorority girl,” but 

now I can’t imagine my college 

life any other way. EAS was the 

space I never knew I needed, 

but in reality, I was drowning 

without it.

As Arab women, many of us 

the daughters of immigrants, 

our presence of simply being 

at the University of Michigan 

is stigmatized. For me, a lot of 

Arab women from my hometown 

either didn’t go to college or 

went to local schools. Going 

away was almost always out of 

the question. Simply being at 

Michigan felt groundbreaking 

to me. But simply being here 

isn’t enough.

As minorities, we’re always 

playing catch up. We can get the 

good grades and the test scores, 

but we lack the key component: 

the network.

One of EAS’s many purposes 

is to fill this gap. By bringing 

together the most ambitious 

and passionate Arab women 

leaders 
on 
campus, 
it 
is 

creating a network of young 

female professionals. Rather 

than a toxic culture of women 

constantly tearing each other 

down and competing with one 

another, EAS serves to provide 

a breath of fresh air of women 

lifting 
each 
other 
up 
and 

helping each other reach their 

academic 
and 
professional 

goals. We want to break the 

stigma against Arab women in 

leadership roles.

Throughout 
my 
life 
as 

an Arab woman, I’ve never 

truly felt like I fit in with 

white people and drifted to 

other communities of color. 

And while I find solace in 

our conjoined alienation and 

marginalization, 
there 
still 

remained a gap. As more Arab 

women are reaching college and 

our communities continue to 

grow, it is especially pertinent 

to provide these spaces like 

EAS so that we no longer have 

to feel lost and alone.

Through EAS, we’re going 

to beat the odds that have 

always been stacked against us.

T

he pressure of choosing 

a 
good 
partner 
for 

class projects is all too 

familiar to us college 

students. 
But 
even 

worse 
than 
having 

to choose is getting 

stuck 
with 
the 

incompetent kid your 

Graduate 
Student 

Instructor randomly 

assigned to you. This 

scenario became all 

too familiar to me 

last semester in my 

physics 
lab 
when, 

every 
Thursday 
morning, 
I 

would walk to my classroom in 

Randall Laboratory and sit next 

to a complete stranger.

I wish I could say my mind 

raced with thoughts like, “I 

wonder if this one is smart” or “I 

hope this one knows what he or 

she’s doing,” but the fact of the 

matter is my mind would already 

be two steps ahead by the time my 

partners even uttered a word. My 

assumptions were pretty binary. 

For guys, it was, “Thank God, 

he seems smart,” and for girls, it 

was, “Looks like I’m on my own 

this week.”

The longer I thought about my 

physics lab, the more I realized 

that this was far from an isolated 

instance. I say this as a self-

proclaimed feminist: I am sexist. 

But how could I not be? By age 6, 

society had already ingrained in 

me that my gender wasn’t cut out 

for the big leagues. I was raised 

to hail names like Albert Einstein 

and Isaac Newton, to gawk at 

CEOs like Steve Jobs and Bill 

Gates. As I grew older, I learned 

that seats for women at male-

dominated tables were limited 

and competition with my own 

gender was the only viable path 

to success.

By the time my 19-year-

old self reached physics lab at 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

the logical side of my mind 

that staunchly supported the 

advancement of my fellow women 

was no match for those disgusting 

but subtle implicit biases that had 

been festering in my mind for 

years.

It is certainly important to 

acknowledge that women have 

made massive strides toward 

gender 
equality, 
but 
these 

past advancements should not 

overshadow the ones that have 

still yet to come. Modern day 

feminism 
faces 
a 

uniquely 
difficult 

path 
ahead. 
Our 

foremothers 
have 

largely 
battled 

and 
defeated 
the 

flagrantly 
obvious 

injustices 
toward 

women, but now it 

is our responsibility 

to 
defeat 
those 

injustices that are not 

so glaring — the ones 

that hide in our subconscious and 

manifest without notice.

It is a common but destructive 

belief that because these forms of 

sexism are so subtle, they are less 

important. But in fact, it is these 

hidden biases that hold women 

back, even when the tangible 

metrics like access to health care 

and education have significantly 

leveled out. The University’s own 

Ross School of Business Class of 

2020 master’s students currently 

consists of 43 percent women. 

While shooting for an eventual 

50-50 
gender 
ratio 
should 

undeniably be a major focus for 

business 
schools, 
we 
cannot 

forget that these advancements 

in higher education are meant to 

reap greater rewards in later life.

Women are 15 percent less 

likely to earn promotions than 

their male counterparts. And to 

make things even more disturbing, 

when the prevalence of females 

grows in a certain industry, 

wages for those jobs tend to see a 

decrease, even when factors like 

required education and relative 

difficulty 
are 
accounted 
for. 

This is not an issue of merit. Our 

society 
subconsciously 
values 

male labor more than female 

labor, and when industries see an 

influx of females, those jobs are 

subsequently perceived as less 

difficult and less valuable.

When 
we 
talk 
about 

programs that seek to advance 

women and minorities in the 

workplace 
and 
academia, 
we 

almost exclusively debate them as 

policies that give an upper hand 

to the disadvantaged and the 

less qualified. We debate these 

programs as if the inferiority 

of women is a given, and that 

the sexism of institutions is 

not. It is time we shift the 

conversation, not just regarding 

these programs, but regarding all 

barriers to female advancement.

Our history textbooks love 

to teach in terms of major 

milestones. 
The 
Nineteenth 

Amendment 
gave 
women 

the right to vote, Title IX 

prohibits sex discrimination in 

federally supported education 

programs and Roe v. Wade 

upheld a woman’s legal right 

to an abortion. But when it 

comes 
to 
eliminating 
the 

sexism that makes me feel 

relief upon getting a male lab 

partner but irritation upon a 

getting a female one, our future 

textbooks may never find a one-

sentence landmark moment.

Our generation may never 

be able to entirely shed our 

sexist tendencies, but we can 

take action to minimize them. 

We all need to make a greater 

effort to simply recognize and 

acknowledge these instances 

when they happen. Everyone 

can be, and often is, sexist 

— not just men or women or 

conservatives or liberals, but 

everyone — and we, as a society, 

must come to terms with that 

if we really want to achieve 

equality of opportunity.

I have spent my entire 

life staring at celebrations of 

successful men, and I am sexist 

as a result of this. We need to 

allow women their fair share 

of 
successes. 
Furthermore,

“

It’s not that global warming is 
like a world war. It is a world 
war. And we are losing.” So 

claims renowned climate scholar Bill 
McKibben in his latest piece urging 
our leaders (and the public they 
serve) to devote the attention and 
resources demanded by the world’s 
scientists and military strategists 
to the greatest threat we have ever 
faced. Despite the University of 
Michigan’s intimate involvement in 
producing the very science behind 
McKibben’s appeal, the University’s 
climate 
efforts 
have 
remained 

painfully weak, with substantive 
action 
stymied 
by 
committees 

formed with little guidance and no 
structural accountability.

In 2015, University President 

Mark Schlissel’s Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction 
Committee 
released 

its report detailing how to achieve 
the meager University emissions 
reduction goals made in 2011, with 
numerous additional actions to take 
in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. 
In the four years since, progress 
has been seemingly non-existent. 
The 
administration 
has 
failed 

to undertake even the simplest 
recommendations to ones that 
better account for greenhouse gas 
emissions.

As is often the case, this failure 

is not due to the passionate and 
well-meaning 
individuals 
who 

volunteered their time and effort 
to produce the report, but rather 
seemingly due to a lack of top-level 
prioritization and a bureaucratic 
framework 
that 
rendered 
the 

committee impotent. More recently, 
another committee, the Blue Ribbon 
Panel, has been accused of being 
unrepresentative and ineffectual 
due to having a vague charge 
and limited power — suggesting 
a more systematic failure in how 
committees are being structured.

For 
this 
reason, 
it 
should 

be no surprise that Schlissel’s 
announcement in October to “put 
U-M on a trajectory toward carbon 
neutrality” was met with skepticism, 
as the only real commitment 
made was to create yet another 
commission “tasked with developing 
U-M’s plan.” Indeed, there is no 

indication that the new Presidential 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
Commission 

will not suffer from the exact same 
structural flaws that doomed the 
GHG Reduction Committee and 
waste precious time in the fight 
against climate change.

So what would make for an 

effective PCNC?

Firstly, the commission needs a 

clear mandate to develop a climate 
action plan in order to achieve an 
explicit goal: a target date of 2035 
for carbon neutrality. Without a 
commitment to a specific goal from 
the 
highest 
levels, 
committees 

spend time exploring irrelevant 
possibilities, and risk having hard-
wrung recommendations be ignored 
— wasting time we cannot afford to 
lose. As McKibben notes, “In this 
war we’re in — the war that physics 
is fighting hard, and that we aren’t — 
winning slowly is the same as losing.”

We know the emissions targets we 

need to hit, and from the resolutions 
passed unanimously by Central 
Student 
Government, 
Rackham 

Student Government, the Senate 
Advisory Committee on University 
Affairs and others, we know that 
the U-M community is united in its 
support of committing the significant 
resources necessary to achieve them.

Secondly, we must be assured 

that our leaders understand the task 
before us and that the considerable 
time taken to chart a path to a 
sustainable future will not be wasted 
because those at the top balk at the 
ambition it requires. Transparency 
of this entire process is therefore 
critical to sustain public trust 
and engagement and to hold the 
administration accountable to the 
plan developed by the commission. 
Attaining this level of accountability 
and transparency requires built-in 
structures mandating a publicly 
available review and assessment 
of 
each 
recommendation 
the 

commission produces.

Thirdly, the commission must 

have representatives from across 
the diverse spectrum of the U-M 
community and include members 
specializing in environmental justice. 
We commend the administration 
for its swift solicitation of public 

input for the commission, but true 
representation only comes from a seat 
at the table.

Finally, we can capitalize on 

the efforts of others to implement 
standards 
of 
transparency 
and 

facilitate the flow of information 
between the University and other 
institutions. A straightforward and 
powerful way to do this would be 
to sign the American College and 
University 
Presidents’ 
Climate 

Commitment, which would take 
advantage of the framework and 
resources already developed and 
employed by others in the pursuit 
of carbon neutrality. Rather than 
wasting precious time reinventing 
the wheel, the PCNC could learn 
from the experience of hundreds of 
other institutions, and easily share the 
efforts undertaken at the University 
so as to amplify our impact and join 
a growing community of institutions 
working to rapidly adapt to an 
uncertain future.

These reasonable and specific 

steps 
provide 
the 
foundation 

needed to achieve the difficult but 
necessary goal of carbon neutrality 
in a scientifically well-founded 
and fiscally responsible manner. 
Furthermore, by having a strong 
vision and adhering to the principles 
of transparency and accountability 
described herein, the University 
will serve as a model institution in 
the fight for a sustainable future, 
providing the framework for other 
institutions to follow. We are eager 
to work together to ensure the 
University is part of the Leaders and 
the Best in the fight for a sustainable 
future.

The Climate Action Movement is 

a coalition of University stakeholders 

(students, faculty, staff and community 

members) working to enact 

sustainability policy that reflects the 

values of the broader U-M community, 

with a focus on the commitment to, 

and attainment of, carbon neutrality.

This letter is adapted from a longer, 

open letter sent to University President 

Mark Schlissel in October 2018.

It is time we shift 
the conversation 

regarding all 

barriers to female 

advancement


On a hot summer day in 1947, 
a rancher noticed some kind of 
wreckage on a homestead outside 
Roswell, New Mexico. Then the 
Army came. And so the theories 
of extraterrestrials emerged. The 
mystery of this small New Mexico 
town has captivated us for seventy 
years now. If The CW’s new teen-
soap would have you believe, the 
key to this small-town mystery is 
that Liz Ortecho (Jeanine Mason, 
“Grey’s Anatomy”) is having some 
very close encounters with Roswell’s 
undercover alien/sheriff’s deputy.
After a decade, Liz returns to 
her hometown, where her dad runs 
the Crashdown Café. The Ortechos 
have become outcasts after Liz’s 
sister killed two local girls while 
driving under the influence. This 
reputation inspires random, unseen 
vigilantes to go after Liz — shooting 
up a diner late at night and killing her. 
Liz’s crush from high school, Max 
(Nathan Parsons, “The Originals”), 
now a deputy, resurrects her with his 
alien powers by touching her wound, 
making very uncomfortable faces and 
spraying her down with ketchup. It’s 
the meet-cute Hollywood has been 
too afraid to give you. Liz is certain 
she was shot, though — the clue being 
a bullet wound — and sets out to 
figure what Max is hiding.
“Roswell” is an impressive feat 
of mediocrity. The narrative is 
elementary. If you’re afraid you 
won’t understand the underscored 

complexities 
of 
this 
interracial, 
extraterrestrial love affair, fear not. 
All the characters announce exactly 
who they are and what is happening. 
We are told with effective bluntness 
that Liz’s arrival coincides with the 
10-year anniversary of her sister’s 
accident. Along with archetypal 
characters, the show also boasts many 
complex characters. Characters like 
alien-sheriff Max, who says “I stay 
here because I like it” one minute, and 

“I want to leave” the next, because 
who cares about genuine motivation 
or character? This inconsistency 
makes him dynamic and brooding. 
Rest assured, this show requires 
absolutely zero brain power to 
understand.
If the possibility of potential 
political undertones also intimidates 
you, don’t worry. As much as the show 
tries to be politically-relevant, it never 
fails to fumble. Any political jabs 
flounder and serve only to distract 
from plot inconsistencies. When 
political commentary is made, no one 

reacts or seems to care, making any 
attempt to be subversive benign.
This show is perfect for fans of 
NPR. Not because of its reliability and 
impressive journalistic reputation, 
of course, but because the characters 
deliver every line without inflection or 
emotion, like static or keeping the fan 
on while you sleep, making “Roswell” 
the perfect show for easy-listening. 
At the same time, the show knows 
it needs a little spice. Flashbacks 
provide this through fuzzy, sunset-lit 
images that tell us nothing about the 
characters or plot. These enhance the 
mystery by being completely useless.
The show also doesn’t assume 
its viewers are dumb, or that it even 
has viewers. “Roswell” doesn’t insult 
them with complex plot devices, 
explanations or even coherency. 
Alien sheriff Max drinks nail polish 
remover to rejuvenate his alien powers 
— no explanation required. The show 
distinguishes itself for having not one, 
but two secret hideouts: an alien nest 
and a secret military base. Both of 
these are completely out in the open 
where anyone could find them, but no 
one does, because the show does not 
need to explain logical fallacies. 
If you’re pursuing a thrilling, 
methodical series with well-executed 
twists and dramatic shocks, if 
you 
seek 
consistent 
character 
development, acting that extends 
beyond one stagnant facial expression 
per character, and convenient plot 
devices that only briefly matter, don’t 
even bother with “Roswell, New 
Mexico.” You wouldn’t grasp its 
understated complexity and brutal 
simplicity. I know I didn’t.

MAXWELL SCHWARZ
For the Daily

Entering 
the 
Taubman 
Biomedical 
Science 
Research 
building, I was unsure how the 
sterile space of a medical building 
could cater to the creativity of a 
fashion show on Jan. 19th. But 
my preconceived misconceptions 
were disproved, shattered by 
the 
energetic 
and 
extremely 
successful runway show put on 
by EnspiRED Runway, a fashion 
and charity student organization 
at the University of Michigan. 
EnspiRED has evolved into 
the student-led force behind a 
yearly fashion show that donates 
all proceeds to a selected charity. 
Said 
Public 
Relations 
chair 
Skylar Wilkes, “This is a great 
opportunity 
for 
students 
to 
showcase their talents through 
art, fashion and design and really 
put on a show that benefits the 
community and exposes them to 
things that they don’t otherwise 
have access to during their time 
at Michigan.”
And showcase they did. The 
title of the show was Allure 
and included six energetic and 
dynamic scenes, each showcasing 
a collection inspired by different 
artistic visions: youth innovators 
and go-getters, the hues of 
the Earth, the Vitruvian Man, 
Gianni 
Versace, 
the 
broken 
column and Kehinde Wiley. Each 

collection had its own distinct 
style manifested through both 
the clothing and the models. 
Creativity saturated the event, 
from the pre-show that included 
dance, spoken word and musical 
pieces, to the closing collection, 
The Red Scene, which allowed 
members of EnspiRED to show 
their own inspiration for looks 
they styled themselves. 
In addition to the fashion and 
art, attendees were reminded 
of the main purpose of the 
event: giving back. This year 
all proceeds from the show 
were donated to Ozone House, 
a community based nonprofit 
organization that helps young 
people in Washtenaw County 
through housing and support 
programs, teaching essential life 
skills, improving relationships 
and enhancing their self image. 
“It’s bigger than just fashion and 
arts, helping people is our top 
priority and I wouldn’t change 
it for the world,” said EnspiRED 
president Vivian Obia.
The show concluded with 
an extremely powerful spoken 
word piece by two volunteers 
from Ozone House, as well as 
closing regards from EnspiRED’s 
talented Executive Board. 
The ability to combine the arts 
and charity is no small feat, yet 
EnspiRED executed this balance 
flawlessly 
and 
will 
continue 
to stylishly empower and help 
those beyond Michigan’s campus 
through fashion.

TV REVIEW

THE CW

Music is a really broad art form. There 
are so many different elements that come 
into play when we traditionally think of 
what makes up music: lyrics, melodies, 
chord progressions, arrangement. The 
list could be endless. The greatest 
challenge for artists is not only finding a 
way to perfect each of these elements, but 
also finding a way to skillfully mix these 
elements into their works. I think when 
an artist is able to do this, they’re able 
to transcend genres in a way that allows 
their work to be viewed purely as art.
When I was introduced to Gregory 
Alan Isakov the summer before college, 
I was very much not in a “folk phase” of 
my life. I was listening to a lot of emo and 
pop-punk (as an angsty freshman does) 
and couldn’t be bothered with genres 
like folk that my parents had brought me 
up with. However, one summer night, 
right before I was about to leave the 
home I’d grown up in, I put on Isakov’s 
album This Empty Northern Hemisphere 
and found myself more immersed in the 
music than I had been in a while. Isakov’s 
voice struck me in a way that not many 
voices have been able to.
This week, Isakov will be heading to 
Ann Arbor as a headliner for the Ann 
Arbor Folk Festival on Fri., Jan. 25th. 
Mostly known for folk music, the South 
Africa-born 
singer-songwriter 
also 
spends half of the year tending to his 
farm in Colorado, something that not 
every musician can claim. Although it’s 
Isakov’s first time at the Ann Arbor Folk 
Festival, it’s not his first time playing in 
Ann Arbor.
“I’ve always really loved Ann Arbor,” 
Isakov stated in an interview with The 
Daily. “I had a good friend that worked 
in the farmer’s market, and I loved it. 

The first time we were there we played 
(at) the Michigan Theater, and we’ve also 
played (at) The Ark a few times.”
Isakov is no stranger when it comes to 
folk festivals, or festivals in general. His 
group has also played at Bonnaroo and 
the Newport Folk Festival, both unique 
in their own right.
“We’ve played a lot of festivals 
throughout our time touring, and I’ve 
always found them a little bit challenging. 

Our music is so intimate, and our 
subtleties are sort of our strong suit, and 
it’s kind of hard to do that when you’re 
playing next to a porta potty at 1:00 PM.” 
Isakov said.“When I was a kid, going to 
a festival seemed so sweet because I got 
to see all my favorite bands in one day. 
But then you start playing them and 
you realize, especially at the giant ones, 
that you’re not seeing every band, you’re 
seeing every band kinda stressed out 

with no sound check.”
But the singer-songwriter doesn’t 
feel this way about every festival. “I’ve 
always wanted to play the Ann Arbor 
Folk Fest,” Isakov stated. “I love playing 
theaters and venues inside. It’s much 
more intimate.”
This event is also special for Isakov 
because he doesn’t get a chance to play 
as many festivals anymore. During the 
summers, he works full time on his farm 
in Colorado, leaving little time to tour and 
attend festivals, making this opportunity 
that much more of a treat for him.
“When I record something, I kind of 
think about one person listening to it, 
like you’re having a conversation with 
one person, like you’re there in their ‘89 
Toyota pickup truck,” Isakov explained. 
“And when you’re in front of a crowd … 
That’s a different medium so you can 
get away with different things.” But 
although 
recording 
and 
performing 
are two totally separate activities for 
Isakov, he appreciates the spontaneity 
that comes with live shows, saying that 
he loves how live shows can be “different 
every night.”
Folk is a genre that can be inherently 
intimate, and Isakov recognizes this, both 
when recording and when performing.
“When I was in high school I was in 
a metal band … and when I was playing 
in bands like that, I would always come 
home and write songs that were really 
quiet, and I don’t know why that is. And 
I would go, ‘OK, what kind of music is 
this? This isn’t metal, this isn’t rock … 
it’s not what I want to play but it’s just … 
happening,” Isakov said.
Gregory Alan Isakov is one of the 
strongest voices in modern folk today, 
and continues to grow with each album. 
Isakov will be performing at the first 
night of the Ann Arbor Folk Festival 
this Friday night, Jan. 25th, along with 
Brandi Carlile and a whole slew of other 
talented artists.

STYLE EVENT REVIEW

When I started this column 
in the fall of 2017, I pitched it to 
the then-managing arts editors 
as “The Neverending Column 
on 
the 
Neverending 
Story”: 
an entertainment and media 
column centered around the 
complete sequelfication of mass 
media and the idea that in the 
current marketplace, any story 
that is profitable will never see 
its end. Over the past year and 
a half I’ve branched out a bit 
into other topics as well, but 
this notion of stories without 
end has continued to fascinate 
me, for if a story doesn’t have 
an ending, can it even really be 
called a story? Since the days 
of first-grade writing, we are 
taught that everything we write 
must have a beginning, middle 
and an end. Take one away and 
you lose that structure. Lose 
that structure and you risk 
losing the story. I have the spent 
many words in this column 
bemoaning this phenomenon, 
decrying Hollywood’s increased 
to desire to squeeze every last 
drop it can out of an idea, until 
the idea has become little more 
than a bad parody of itself. And 
yet in 2019, as the decade draws 
to a close, it appears that three 
of the biggest entertainment 
products of the last decade may 
end as well: Marvel’s “Avengers,” 
Disney’s new “Star Wars” trilogy 
and of course HBO’s “Game of 
Thrones.”
Each of these properties will 
spend most of the year marketing 
their next installment as the 
final chapter of their respective 
series. In all three cases, this 
will be misleading at best and an 
outright lie at worst. Let’s take 
each one individually, starting 
with “Avengers: Endgame.”
Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity 
War” was marketed as though 
it was “Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hallows Part II” when 
really it was “Harry Potter and 
the Deathly Hallows Part I.” 
“Endgames”’s marketing looks 
to be a little less misleading since 
the film (due to be released on 
April 26) will presumably wrap 
up the cliffhanger from the 
last movie and is ostensibly a 
capstone to the overall Thanos 
arc that began with 2012’s “The 
Avengers.” But the claim that the 
film will be an “ending” in any 
sense is somewhat debatable. 
Part of it definitely depends on 
what the actual storyline of the 
film consists of, which may or 
may not be the deaths of a handful 
of beloved characters (such as 
Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man or 
Chris Evans’ Captain America). 
But 
because 
the 
“half-the-
universe-disappears” 
gimmick 

that concluded “Infinity War” 
has already been somewhat 
undercut by the trailer for 
“Spider Man: Far From Home” 
— showing Spidey back in action 
(you can’t keep a good spider 
down for long) — it’s hard to see 
how much impact “Endgame” 
will have on the wider MCU. 
Will there really be no more 
“Avengers” movies? We know 
there’s going to be more Black 
Panther, more Doctor Strange 

and more Spider-Man. Even 
Loki, who was last seen being 
impaled by Thanos with a sharp 
tool, will return for a streaming 
series on Disney+ next fall. 
On the face of it, “Star Wars” 
may be coming to a more 
conclusive 
ending 
than 
the 
MCU. 
Unlike 
the 
sprawling 
Marvel saga, Lucasfilm has not 
announced any more films after 
the release of “Episode IX” 
next Christmas. But if anyone 
out there actually believes that 
there won’t be, then they clearly 
haven’t been paying attention. 
Back in 2012, Disney bought 
Lucasfilm to the tune of 4 billion 
dollars, so they’re not about to 
pack up and call it a day after 
one trilogy. How successful 
“Star Wars” will continue to 
be, though, beyond the sequel 
trilogy remains to be seen. Last 
year’s Han Solo prequel did not 
fare well at the box office, and 
it’s an open question whether or 
not audiences will continue to 
flock to “Star Wars” movies that 
don’t feature legacy characters 
like 
Luke, 
Han 
and 
Leia. 
“Solo” seemingly proved that 
recasting such characters may 
not be advisable either, and it’s 
anyone’s guess what direction 
the franchise will go in. At one 
point in time, Lucasfilm had 
announced a trilogy from “Last 
Jedi” director Rian Johnson as 
well as a new trilogy with the 
“Game of Thrones” showrunners 
at the helm, but since those 
announcements over a year ago, 
nothing more has been said 
about those plans. Regardless, it 

seems improbable that “Episode 
IX” will be the last “Star Wars” 
movie, and depending on how 
well it does, don’t be surprised 
if episodes X, XI and XII aren’t 
closer than we think.
As for “Game of Thrones” — 
the last water cooler show, king 
of television, heir to Tolkein and 
protector of the HBO realm — the 
final set of six episodes premieres 
in April and then the world of 
Westeros will be left behind. 
That is, until the release of one of 
the five different spin-off series 
that HBO has been developing. 
The first of these, tentatively 
titled “The Long Night,” already 
has a cast and crew lined up, 
and could be ready as soon as 
summer 
2020. 
Meanwhile, 
George R.R. Martin still claims 
to be working on the next book in 
the “Song of Ice and Fire” series 
upon which the show is based. 
Like Star Wars, I’m skeptical 
of the prospects of a “Thrones” 
spin-off. Will audiences really 
care about a very similar story 
with a bunch of characters they 
don’t know anything about? Is 
the ancient history of Westeros 
really 
that 
interesting? 
If 
Martin’s recent tome “Fire and 
Blood” is anything to go by, the 
answer may be no. 
No matter how it all shakes 
out, it seems perfectly plausible 
that come 2020, all three of 
these 
blockbuster 
franchises 
will be past their glory days. If 
the 2010s have been defined by 
superheroes and dragons, by 
legacy sequels and the return 
of decades-old series, what will 
the entertainment landscape of 
the next decade look like? It’s 
hard to say. Always in motion, 
the future is. When Walt Disney 
bought Lucasfilm in 2012, the 
same year “The Avengers” came 
out, they couldn’t have known 
how strong brands like Netflix 
and Hulu would become, or how 
important streaming would be 
to the overall entertainment 
landscape. “Game of Thrones” 
has been HBO’s biggest show 
since it premiered in 2011 and 
it’s hard to imagine what the 
network will be like without its 
flagship program going forward. 
In a way all three of these brands 
will face the same problem when 
the dust settles and “the end” 
has come and gone. What is “Star 
Wars” without a Skywalker? 
Can the Marvel Universe still 
soar without Robert Downey 
Jr. at the helm? And will there 
ever be a show like “Game of 
Thrones” again? There’s no way 
to know. For now, though, fans 
and executives can just sit back 
over the next year and enjoy the 
final lap.

The day Mary Oliver died, I 
read a piece in The Atlantic about 
existential therapy. “It was a bit like 
coming across a line in a poem or a 
quote in a book that you relate to on 
an eerily intimate level — something 
of your most personal experience 
mirrored back to you, and you realize 
all at once that someone else has had 
the very same thought,” writes Faith 
Hill of her first existential therapy 
session. “Suddenly and certainly, if 
only for that moment, you are a little 
less alone.”
Like an existential therapist, 
Mary Oliver was a guide to the 
emotional 
landscape 
of 
life, 
someone who saw the ways that 
all internal opposites — loneliness 
and companionship, thrill and 
mourning, love and apathy — share 
an intimate inner boundary. Oliver 
was never afraid to write about 
difficult subjects; fear and death 
are constant companions to her 
narrators. The frank familiarity with 
which she approached life makes 
her poetry a relief to read. Like many 
of her readers, I feel I knew Oliver 
and that she, in some way, knew me. 
To have one’s emotions cataloged 
by a stranger is one of poetry’s 
most shocking pleasures, and I’ve 
never been rewarded in this way 
more frequently than while reading 
Oliver’s work.
As a poet of the natural 
world, reading Mary Oliver feels 
particularly urgent in 2019. Over 
the past year, it has become clear 
that the worst-case scenario for 
climate change is upon us. When it 
snowed for the first time a few days 
ago, magical and unusually late for 

Michigan, I was almost relieved 
when my boots soaked through. In 
our rapidly shifting world, thinking 
about nature on Oliver’s terms is 
both a comfort and call to action. 
If she had been walking with me 
through the snow, I might have told 
her about the rabbits I used to see 
on the lawn in early fall. She would 
have wondered aloud about their 
contentedness, their warm home.
Mary Oliver noticed, and out of 
that noticing grew a commitment to 
the details that populate life. There 
are many things to be admired 
about the way Oliver committed her 
observations to the page. Her poetry 
was unpretentious and clean, messy 
when the circumstances demand it. 
Meaty and delicate. I appreciate the 
way she went inside intuition, asking 
us to be within ourselves and outside 
our limitations at once. Her poetry 
feels uniquely true; to read Mary 
Oliver is to be seen.
In March of 1986 she published 
one of my favorite poems, “Every 
Morning.” She writes: “A craziness 
we so far have no name for— / all this 
I read in the papers, / in the sunlight, 
/ I read with my cold, sharp eyes.”
“A craziness we so far have no 
name for”: This could describe the 
past year perfectly. Oliver is not an 
overtly political poet, but her poems 
suggest a philosophy of respect 
that implies a theory of everything, 
including politics: Be kind and 
present. Be cognizant of the ripples 
engendered 
by 
your 
actions, 
intentions and emotions.
In “Wild Geese,” she writes: 
“Whoever you are, no matter how 
lonely, / the world offers itself to your 
imagination, / calls to you like the 
wild geese, harsh and exciting— / 
over and over announcing your place 
/ in the family of things.”

In “Invitation,” speaking of 
goldfinches, Oliver writes: “It could 
mean something. / It could mean 
everything. / It could be what Rilke 
meant, when he wrote, / You must 
change your life.”
We were assigned Rainer Maria 
Rilke’s “Letters to a Young Poet” for 
my journalism class last week. I like 
to think about Mary Oliver reading 
Rilke at home in Provincetown or 
Manhattan or Florida, surrounded 
by her books and her partner, the late 
photographer Mary Malone Cook. I 
like to split the screen: She’s on one 
side reading Rilke at her kitchen 
table, and I’m on the other side, 
reading at a desk way up on the fifth 
floor of Hatcher, where the windows 
face the gray expanse of State Street. 
We both think about devotion.
Like any good therapist, Oliver 
never 
answers 
our 
questions 
directly. 
Instead, 
her 
poetry 
entrusts us with the materials that 
accomodate 
an 
understanding 
of why our uncertainties cannot 
always be resolved. Oliver has left 
us with a body of work that endures. 
She was lucky: She could say what 
she needed to about the world. We 
are lucky: We get to read it.
“There are so many stories, / 
more beautiful than answers,” 
Oliver writes in “Snake.” What 
remains of Mary Oliver’s life are not 
answers but stories: hers and our 
own, and the understanding that 
the distinction between the two is 
decidedly unstable.
I was thinking about Oliver three 
days ago as I walked through the 
Law Quad on my way home. The 
lights of the library were burning 
orange strips into the dark sky. I 
wanted her to tell this night back to 
me, distilled. She would have been 
amazed.

BOOK NOTEBOOK

PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE
Remembering Mary Oliver

On the morning of Jan. 21st, a 
friend and I embarked on a frigid 
trek to the Burton Memorial 
Tower for some of the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day campus 
events. Both of us being music 
lovers, we decided that the event, 
“Centering 
Black 
Composers: 
Music To Unravel The Classical 
Canon” would be a perfect way to 
celebrate this historic day. For a 
girl from a primarily conservative, 
primarily white suburb of Grand 
Rapids, Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day was not widely celebrated at 
my school. I was excited to finally 
have the opportunity to see a 
celebration in remembrance of 
such an important man.
We climbed the steps of the 
bell tower, searching for the 
concert room or at least a couple 
of instruments. When we made it 
to the top, we saw nothing but the 
bells and a few people blocking the 
entrance to a tiny room. We stood 
outside gazing up at the bells for 
an entire song before realizing 
that this was the performance: 
The music of the bells.
Inside the tiny blocked room sat 
Professor Tiffany Ng, University 
carillonist and assistant professor 
of the carillon. Pounding the 
wooden batons in the formation 
of a piano keyboard, she put her 
entire body into the songs. She 
has been playing since 2001, 
mastering the art when she was 
a freshman at Yale University. 

Working with Dr. Yvette Janine 
Jackson, who arranged a carillon 
version of “Freedom Is A Constant 
Struggle,” and paying homage to 
Jessie Montgomery, the first Black 
woman to publish music for the 
carillon, Professor Ng’s tribute to 
Martin Luther King Jr. rang out 
over all of the University campus.
The recital was brief but 
beautiful. It consisted of seven 
songs, all composed by Black 
artists. Ng preceded each song 
with 
short 
anecdotes 
about 
the 
composers, 
the 
original 
performers and the significance 
of the songs, juxtaposing the 
beautiful melodies to the harsh 
realities in which they were 
created. She began the concert 
with “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a 
song that is often referred to as the 
“Black National Anthem,” written 
by James Weldon Johnson and 
put to music by John Rosamond 
Johnson 
in 
1899. 
She 
then 
performed songs written by Black 
women and composers of Motown 
and 
Soul. 
The 
penultimate 
song was “A Change Is Gonna 
Come,” which was written by 
Sam Cooke in 1964. She told us 
he never performed his original 
lyrics because they were too 
heartbreaking. Her rendition was 
no less moving, even without the 
words. She concluded with Aretha 
Franklin’s famous “Respect” in 
reverence of the recently deceased 
legendary soul singer.
All of the events the University 
hosted for Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day were incredibly impactful. 
But combining the arts with such 

an important message brought an 
entirely new beautiful meaning to 
the what the day stands for. The 
arts are how we express ourselves, 
all the pain and the hardship, 
all the joy and triumph of our 
lives. Highlighting this poignant 
music born out of the immense 
struggle of the Black community 
is essential to giving them the 
recognition they deserve.
I will never be able to truly 
understand what Martin Luther 
King Jr. and his people had to 
go through in his lifetime or the 
fights they had to endure. But I do 
understand music, and through it 
I can catch a glimpse into the lives 
of these people that suffered so 
much to get where they are.
Music has always been an 
essential part of the civil rights 
movement. At the heart of every 
march, there is always a chant, 
always a song to keep morale 
up and keep the fight going. 
From gospel hymns to modern 
Motown songs, music has made a 
significant difference in the lives 
of those fighting. Often times, 
the arts act as a means of dissent, 
as much as they are casually 
enjoyed. So many talented artists 
channel 
their 
feelings 
about 
injustice and discrimination into 
their work, which makes it all the 
more powerful. That is exactly 
what all the Black artists who 
composed the songs performed 
in the bell tower did. “Don’t let 
anyone tell you the arts can’t make 
a difference,” Professor Ng told 
her 
audience. 
“Representation 
matters.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
MLK Day lifts every voice

DANA PIERANGELI
For the Daily

Imagine a funhouse at a local 
fair or festival, the kind with 
a maze of mirrors, undulating 
floors, a steep, enormous slide, 
mirrors that stretch and squish 
viewers, air jets meant to 
startle patrons and a tunnel of 
love. Now, take that funhouse, 
drop it in the world of Atlanta’s 
rap superstars and let Future 
create the soundtrack. The 
WIZRD is exactly how that 
would sound.
On his seventh album, Future 
has once again transformed 
himself. 
As 
one 
of 
rap’s 
foremost stars with an image to 
maintain, he made the decision 
to try something new. He set 
out to craft a collection of songs 
that will warp, distort and 
reimagine the sound of Atlanta 
trap music. With help from a 
team of stalwart producers and 
up-and-comers, 
Future 
has 
done just that.
The 
rapper 
displays 
a 
newfound 
hunger 
on 
The 
WIZRD. He showcases his 
dexterity over off-kilter beats 
from the likes of Tay Keith 
and 808 Mafia’s Southside and 
TM88. Amidst the chaos, his 
voice rings out loud and clear 
as he twists his words around 
the rumble of the 808s and the 
spark of the keys and samples. 

The lead single, “Crushed Up,” 
is a prime example. Future is at 
his best on this track, turning 
the braggadocio to the max as 
he ponders his lavish lifestyle. 
Now, if not for the production 
from Wheezy, this track would 
be standard Future fare. This 
is by no means a bad thing, but 
the production on this song, 
and the album as a whole for 
that matter, is where Future 
begins to experiment. Never 
has he rapped over a beat this 
strange. As the beat’s sample 
rides, its keys are stretched to 
their limit, sounding more like 
a wail than a synth blast.
This continues throughout 
the entire album. Every beat 
sounds as if it came straight 
from a carnival, and Future, 
fully embodying his “wizard” 
title, is nothing short of magical 
as he flows over each of them. 
As with most of his releases, 
Future is more focused on the 
vibe of each track than the 
lyrics. However, between the 
slick talk and the boasts, he 
still finds time to throw some 
sentimentality into his lyrics. 
On the album opener “Never 
Stop,” 
Future’s 
delivery 
is 
somber and subdued, and the 
lyrics parallel this. “Never 
Stop” is Future reflecting on his 
entire career up to the release 
of The WIZRD, covering the 
ground between his rise to 
fame and his recent kicking of 

his lean habit. Introspective 
cuts like this and “Krazy but 
True” 
blended 
with 
hard 
hitters like “Call the Coroner” 
allow Future to showcase just 
how multifaceted a rapper he 
is.
Given 
all 
the 
highlights 
Future provides listeners, he 
occasionally strays from the 
path and makes some poor 
decisions. Primarily, the album 
is far too long. Clocking in at 
over one hour with 20 tracks, 
The 
WIZRD 
overstays 
its 
welcome at times. If five to 
seven of the weaker tracks like 
“First Off” featuring Travis 
Scott and “Talk Shit like a 
Preacher,” whose sounds are 
beyond played out at this point, 
were cut, the album would 
benefit greatly. Songs like these 
are not bad, but they bring 
nothing new to the table. Their 
beats are fairly pedestrian and 
the lyrics and flow are typical 
of Atlanta trap. They are so 
glaringly normal that they 
hold The WIZRD back from 
being near the top of Future’s 
discography.
Nonethless, The WIZRD feels 
like a return to form for Future, 
who just recently released a 
lackluster collaborative album 
with Juice WRLD. If anything, 
this album proves that Future, 
even at this stage of his career, 
has more than enough gas left 
in the tank.

Swimmers find home 
away from home with ‘M’

Before the start of its senior 
day meet, the No. 2 Michigan 
women’s swimming and diving 
team lined up on the deck for the 
playing of the national anthem.
But the Star Spangled Banner 
wasn’t the only anthem played. 
Michigan played the Chinese, 
Japanese and Yemeni national 
anthems and hung flags for 
each country off the edge of the 
diving platforms in honor of its 
international teammates.
Four years ago, Yirong Bi 
and Siobhán Haughey arrived 
in Ann Arbor, traveling more 
than 7,000 miles from their 
homes 
in 
Hangzhou, 
China 
and Hong Kong, respectively. 
Saturday’s meet was the last 
time Bi, Haughey and their five 
senior teammates would swim 
in Canham Natatorium for the 
Wolverines. 
“To hear my national anthem, 
in this amazing house is very 
different for me,” Bi said. “The 
last time I heard my national 
anthem was at the Asian Games 
where I won a gold medal. But 
this I think means more to me 
because I’ve treated this place as 
home for the past four years.”
In their final home meet 
against 
No. 
22 
Ohio 
State, 

Haughey swam in four events, 
and Bi swam in three. Haughey 
won all her events—the 100-yard 
freestyle, the 200-yard freestyle, 
the 200-yard individual medley 
and the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Bi came in first in the 500-yard 
freestyle by an impressive margin 
of three-and-a-half seconds. She 
finished second in the 100-yard 
freestyle and was a member of 
the third place 400-yard freestyle 
relay B team.
“That’s a good senior class 
with those kinds of wins,” said 
Michigan coach Mike Bottom.
Both 
swimmers 
have 
an 
impressive list of achievements. 
Haughey appeared in the 2016 
Rio Olympics for Hong Kong 
and earned a 13th-place finish in 
the 200-meter freestyle. Bi won 
gold in the 800 and 400-meter 
freestyle events at the 2014 Asian 
Games. Both are three-time 
All-Big Ten first team and have 
numerous CSCAA All-American 
honors.
Swimming accomplishments 
aside, the Michigan program 
holds a very special meaning to 
both athletes.
“I think it’s very hard to sum 
up what the team means to me,” 
Haughey said. “I’m just very 
grateful to be on this team. When 
I first came here we were still a 
team that was building … Last 

year we were fourth in the nation 
… I’m so grateful to be a part of it.”
For Bi, the team gave her 
a 
sense 
of 
belonging. 
Her 
most 
memorable 
experience 
traces back to the 2016 Big Ten 
Championships, where she swam 
the first leg of the 800-yard 
freestyle for the Wolverines.
“I was a freshman coming 
from China, I didn’t really have a 
lot of friends,” Bi recalled. “I was 
so excited about my first Big Tens 
(Big Ten Championships), it was 
here. In the 800-free relay I went 
first, and I was so nervous and 
so excited I forgot to breathe the 
first 25 meters.”
The 
relay 
team, 
which 
Haughey was also a part of, went 
on to win first place by a margin 
of over two seconds. Bi swims in 
it every year for Michigan, and 
the team has won the relay all 
three years.
“I didn’t do well for my part, I 
felt guilty … my teammates came 
to me saying, ‘It’s fine you did a 
good job,’” Bi said. “That’s the 
first time I felt like, ‘Yeah, I’m 
actually in the team now, I’m not 
just swimming for myself, my 
teammates have my back.’”
This moment not only gave 
Bi 
comradeship 
with 
her 
teammates—it provided comedy.
“It’s become a joke with the 
team and that’s good because 
everyone laughs about it now,” Bi 
said.
With their days of swimming 
meets in Canham Natatorium 
behind them, Bi and Haughey 
still have the Big Ten and NCAA 
Championships to look forward 
to and the lifelong bond with 
their teammates.
“(I’ll miss) just spending a lot 
of time with my teammates,” 
Haughey said. “It’s nice just to 
be surrounded with positive 
and happy people who are as 
motivated as you are … I’ve made 
a lot of friends that will become 
my life-long friends. I’ve just 
learned so much here.”

CAMERON HUNT/Daily
Senior Yirong Bi came to Michigan four years ago from Hangzhou, China.

Looking back on winding career, Taylor Rooks connects the dots

As a five-star recruit back in 
high school, Taylor Rooks had 
many colleges to choose from to 
continue her basketball career.
She wanted a school where she 
could excel — both academically 
and on the court — and narrowed 
her decision down to three schools: 
Stanford, Harvard and Michigan. 
Still, a tough decision loomed.
“I committed very late,” Rooks 
said. “I didn’t know where I wanted 
to go, because I felt like all the 
schools pretty much equally would 
prepare me for what I wanted to do 
in life, because they’re all the best 
schools in the country.”
After much thought, the two-
time New Jersey Gatorade Player 
of the Year committed to the 
Cardinal.
Little did she know she’d end up 
attending all three.
***
Now on the Michigan women’s 
basketball team — and as graduate 
student in the Ross School of 
Business — Rooks reflects on 
the past and puts things into 
perspective.
“I had no idea from the 
beginning. I thought I was gonna 
go to Stanford, graduate after 

four years and go on with my life,” 
Rooks said. “And as my path has 
shown me, it is the exact opposite. 
I got to go to all three corners of 
the country. But I’m very grateful 
that I’ve had that opportunity.”
During her freshman year, 
Rooks went to the Sweet 16 of the 
NCAA Tournament with Stanford. 
After the season, though, she 
decided to change paths.
Despite her success in high 
school, 
Rooks 
wasn’t 
aiming 
for the WNBA after her college 
career ended. Rather, she dreamt 
of a future beyond basketball — a 
career in finance.
“I’d have to credit that to kind of 
how my parents raised me, but also 
how I kind of changed throughout 
high school,” Rooks said of her 
career plans. “If you asked me 
when I was 10 years old what I 
wanted to do, I would say I wanted 
to play in the WNBA, no questions 
asked. … My parents always told 
me to think a lot farther ahead.”
Rooks 
remembers 
the 
experience 
that 
sparked 
her 
interest in finance. While thinking 
about potential careers back in 
high school, her father suggested 
that she consider finance. He 
helped her shadow a wealth 
management expert. Upon seeing 
the trading floor, Rooks made up 

her mind.
Summer 
internships 
are 
important 
for 
acquiring 
jobs 
in finance. With the Cardinal, 
though, Rooks’ summers were tied 
up due to athletic demands.
She decided to transfer to the 
Crimson, as she knew Harvard 
would give her summers off.
That decision paid dividends. 
The summer after her sophomore 
year — which she sat out due to 
transfer rules — Rooks interned at 
Northwestern Mutual in Boston 
as a financial representative. After 
junior year, she interned in New 
York City with Credit Suisse, 
receiving a full-time offer by the 
end of the summer.
Rooks made her way to the 
court, too. Her versatility helped 
her play multiple roles, and from 
junior to senior year, she just 
about doubled both her minutes 
and points per game. Senior year, 
she shot 47.7 percent from the 
floor while notching 12.5 points a 
contest.
“The weather was a little 
worse 
than 
Stanford,” 
Rooks 
mentioned 
about 
transferring. 
“ … Academically, it was pretty 
much the same — even like here at 
Ross. It’s all been about the same; I 
mean, it’s very challenging, and it’s 
a lot of demands.”

Meeting those demands has not 
been an issue. Rooks mentioned 
her high school — Gill St. Bernard’s 
School — was among the top in the 
state of New Jersey and that it 
prepared her academically.
“I even felt some of my classes 
there were harder than the classes 
I took in college,” Rooks said.
Rooks seems to have mastered 
the student-athlete balance. To 
stay on top of things, she makes 
use of her free time and avoids 
procrastination.
“Procrastination is the absolute 
worst thing,” Rooks said. “ … But 
at the same time, on our off days, 
I’ll make sure most of that day I’m 
off — mentally and physically — 
just so I’m not always going, going, 
going.”
Near the end of her last season 
at Harvard, Rooks realized she 
wasn’t ready to give up basketball. 
So, she decided to use her final year 
of eligibility, and she knew exactly 
where to go.
“Given that I already went to 
Stanford and Harvard,” Rooks 
said, “the other school in my top 
three was Michigan, and I was 
like, ‘Okay, that’s it.’ ”
After 
connecting 
with 
the 
Wolverines, she joined the Master 
of Management program and 
committed to the team, even 

without taking a further visit. 
Rooks believes business school 
nicely complements the economics 
degree she received at Harvard. 
She also got her job offer extended 
and will join Credit Suisse after 
graduating.
Since she’s only at Michigan for 
one year, Rooks hopes to share the 
wisdom she has gained through 
her unique past with her younger 
teammates. She relies on bringing 

positive energy to make her 
impact.
And it seems she has been 
successful.
***
In the midst of Rooks’ chat with 
the Daily, Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico interrupts.
“Thank god for her personality 
and what she brings to our team,” 
Barnes Arico said. “ … She’s a 
rockstar.”

Taking ownership of penalty kill

Some players thrive with 
their backs against the wall.
Few 
moments 
throughout 
a hockey game better reveal 
who those players are than on 
the penalty kill. The Michigan 
hockey team may have found 
a pair of skaters who fit that 
mold.
With the loss of sophomore 
forward 
Josh 
Norris, 
who 
would frequently be on the 
man-disadvantage, the success 
of the penalty-killing duo of 
freshman forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe and sophomore forward 
Dakota Raabe is increasingly 
important.
Last season, Van Wyhe was 
killing penalties for the Fargo 
Force. Van Wyhe, who had a 
plus-minus rating of 19 for the 
Force last season, was a big part 
of that penalty kill. That team 
went on to win the 2018 Clark 
Cup — the prize jewel of the 
USHL.
The six-foot-two, 200-pound 
frame of the defensive-minded 
freshman forward at times 
seems as though it is gliding 
faster than it should. Raabe, 
the skater who is usually paired 
with him on the penalty kill, 
is fast and defensive-minded, 
much like Van Wyhe.
But with regards to physical 
appearance, the two could not 
be more different. They are 
like foils to one another in that 
aspect: Raabe stands at five-
foot-nine and is thirty pounds 
lighter than Van Wyhe.
And yet, despite the physical 
differences, 
the 
mentality 
hardly differs.
“It starts on the faceoff,” Van 
Wyhe said about the mindset 
on the penalty kill. “That’s the 
first battle. Then it’s one-on-
one battles from there.”
Like a craftsman describing 
his work, he continued.

“So, if you get that faceoff, 
there’s an automatic 20 seconds 
killed getting it all the way 
down the ice and resetting and 
doing it again. But other than 
that just kind of, if you see an 
opportunity to jump, you jump 
it, and then getting in the way of 
shots is a little kind of abstract 
— the thought process. You 
don’t really want to get in front 
of the flying puck when it’s 
going that fast.”
One guy who has a propensity 
for getting his body in front of a 
shot is Raabe.
“He’s blocking shots, last 
year he didn’t block many 
shots,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson about the sophomore. 
“He’s sticking his nose in there 
this year. He’s grown. He’s 
matured. He’s a much better 
player.”
And 
though 
not 
clearly 
represented by the numbers, 
sophomore 
forward 
Dakota 
Raabe has made a leap this 
season. 
That 
may 
be 
best 
demonstrated by the level of 
trust 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson is showing in Raabe. 
He has featured prominently 
on penalty kills alongside Van 
Wyhe and, along with freshman 
forward 
Nolan 
Moyle, 
has 
been a part of perhaps the 
Wolverines’ 
most 
consistent 

line as of late.
Pearson expressed a sense of 
pride with the interest that the 
linemates have shown on the 
penalty kill.
“I think that’s when you 
really start to see your penalty 
kill improve, when your players 
start 
to 
take 
ownership,” 
Pearson said. “When they start 
to get more involved. They 
almost become coaches when 
in your meetings they say, ‘Hey, 
what about this?’ or ‘Maybe we 
can try this instead of that,’ 
then you know the players 
are involved. Then, you know 
they’ve got some skin in the 
game.”
Currently, Michigan ranks a 
middling fourth among Big Ten 
teams with a 79.3 penalty-kill 
percentage. It is a figure that 
will have to improve throughout 
the remainder of the season if 
the Wolverines hope to make a 
postseason appearance.
For now, though, it seems as 
though Michigan may be on the 
right track.
“I think we finally just 
started clicking within,” Raabe 
said. “We just kind of sacrificed 
more, made (the penalty kill) 
kind of a priority in a way. And 
we’ve been having success for it 
and hopefully keep that going 
in the future.”

At the buzzer

Charles Matthews nails floater as time expires to stave off late upset bid from Minnesota

MINNESOTA
MICHIGAN 
57
59

Michigan stood on the cusp 
of disaster, and Ignas Brazdeikis 
started 
a 
drive. 
When 
he 
finished it, things hadn’t gotten 
much better — a layup attempt 
falling short, the game still tied, 
a double-digit lead still blown, 
overtime still waiting with two 
seconds to go.
Amid the ensuing scramble, 
the ball found its way to Charles 
Matthews. The redshirt junior 
hung in the air, releasing a 
desperate floater. As the buzzer 
sounded, it somehow found 
nylon, and after a lengthy 
review, it somehow stood.
“I know Iggy. That’s my little 
brother,” a subdued Matthews 
said after the game. “He’s like 
a bull in the china shop when 
he’s going to the rim. So he ain’t 
looking to kick out. So I just said, 
‘You know what, he might miss 
this one, let me try to just go get 
the rebound.’ And thank god I 
was in the right position for it.
“Gotta know your teammates. 
Know your personnel.”
This was as close to a 
catastrophe as you could have 
gotten. But thanks to Matthews’ 
buzzer-beater, No. 5 Michigan 
(18-1 overall, 7-1 Big Ten) left 
Crisler Center with a 59-57 win 
over Minnesota (14-5, 4-4) on 
Tuesday, narrowly avoiding a 
second-straight loss.
Thirty 
seconds 
before 
Matthews ended the game, the 
Gophers’ Gabe Kalscheur tied 
it with a 3-pointer. Minutes 
earlier, the Wolverines held a 
double-digit lead.
And, even after Minnesota cut 
a 10-point lead to six with 2:22 
to go, it sent sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole to the free-throw 
line with a chance to put any 

worry to rest. He proceeded to 
miss two free throws, setting the 
stage for a near-collapse.
“Usually, we all have a saying,” 
Matthews said. “We usually 
come out to the game looking, 
we be like, ‘Alright, let’s run ‘em 
out the gym.’ And we usually put 
our foot on their neck and touch 
it to the floor. But this game, they 
made some big shots.”
After 
a 
poor 
offensive 
showing on Saturday, things 
weren’t much better on Tuesday, 
as the Wolverines shot just 3-of-
22 from deep and 33.9 percent 
from the field. Brazdeikis and 
junior center Jon Teske, who 
finished with 18 and 15 points, 
respectively, were relied upon to 
carry the load, as no other player 
had more than seven.
And still, earlier on in the 
second half, the game seemed all 
but over.
After 
Minnesota 
took 
a 
three-point lead into halftime, 
Brazdeikis broke 
out of his slump, 
keying a run that 
saw him score 
eight of his 18 
points on the day. 
The 
Wolverines 
proceeded to take 
their first lead of 
the game, 39-37, 
on 
a 
running 
sky-hook 
from 
sophomore guard 
Zavier Simpson.
That 
lead 
would grow as 
high as 13 points 
with 
under 
10 
minutes to go — 
and 
Michigan 
seemed 
on 
its 
way to a relaxing 
home win.
Far from it.
“We’ve 
got 

to grow a 
lot,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach John 
Beilein. “13-point lead late, and 
how many times do you see that 
happen at Michigan where we 
let it go like that? Continue to 
teach these guys what it takes to 
win games like that because that 
could’ve went the other way.
“I mean, that wouldn’t have 
been a devastating loss, but 
you’re up by that amount and 
we don’t make foul shots and we 
also don’t execute on offense, we 
don’t share the ball the way we 
need to share it, you can get beat. 
Defensive transition, everybody 
watching, those are tough things 
for us.”
A few minutes later, Beilein 
was asked if he expected more 
growth after the Wolverines 
suffered their first loss.
“I was,” he said. “I’d be lying 
if I said I’m not disappointed.”

Despite inefficiency, Brazdeikis provides spark with aggression

Ignas Brazdeikis stood in 
front of reporters last Friday 
with 
Michigan’s 
showdown 
against Wisconsin looming.
Holding an undefeated, 17-0 
record and a No. 2 national 
ranking, 
the 
Wolverines 
were riding high, and so was 
Brazdeikis. Nothing out of the 
ordinary, though — if one thing 
defines the freshman forward 
besides scoring in bunches, it’s 
an exuberant self-confidence 
and air of swagger.
A win over the Badgers had 
the potential to push Michigan 
to No. 1 overall, its first such 
ranking in five years. So it’s 
understandable that Friday’s 
conversation eventually turned 
to then-No. 1 Duke and its own 
star freshman forward, Zion 
Williamson. How would the 
Wolverines fare against the 
Blue Devils? Would Brazdeikis 
guard Williamson?
What do you think he said?
“I would love to play Duke. 
… They’ve got that No. 1 team, 
that No. 1 hype, and we feel 
like we’re definitely better 
than them. We’re just looking 
forward to playing every single 
team, and we’re not scared of no 
competition. … I would love to 
guard Zion. I’ll guard anyone.”
Less than 24 hours later, 
Brazdeikis and his teammates 
quietly slumped away while 
Wisconsin fans stormed the 
floor of Kohl Center, fresh off 
a 64-54 upset that knocked 
Michigan from the ranks of the 
unbeaten. The loss was a gut-
punch, and probably even more 
so for Brazdeikis, who was 
averaging 15.6 points per game 
coming in — for the first time in 
his college career, he was held 
scoreless.
Then Brazdeikis missed his 
first seven shots on Tuesday 
against 
Minnesota. 
The 
narrative looked to be in full 
force — the Wolverines and 
their 
swaggering 
youngster 
humbled at last; the freshman 
finally 
figured 
out. 
Maybe 
Brazdeikis was an ordinary 
rookie after all.

Not to his teammates.
“I 
told 
him 
to 
stay 
aggressive,” said redshirt junior 
guard Charles Matthews. “I 
told him, I kinda 
went 
through 
the same thing 
last year, where 
you might not 
be as productive 
as you once was. 
I just told him 
stay aggressive 
at all costs, I 
believe in you, 
keep going.”
Added junior 
center Jon Teske: “He’s a great 
player. Shooters gonna shoot, 
and he’s going to do that. He’s 
going to get to the paint, he’s 
going to attack.”
With 1:45 before halftime, 
Brazdeikis spun past a defender 
and banked home his first 
basket since Jan. 13. He added 
a left-handed layup a minute 
later, giving him momentum 
into intermission.
“I 
was 
just 
like, 
thank 
goodness I got something to 
go for me,” Brazdeikis said. 
“I’m obviously not going to lose 
confidence in myself, that’s 
definitely something that’s not 
going to happen with me. But 
my teammates just trusting 
me and the coaches trusting 
me to keep going, keep playing 
— that’s the only reason why I 
could do this.”
“This” was Brazdeikis nearly 
single-handedly 
putting 
the 
Wolverines in control of the 
game with eight points in the 
span of three minutes. Two 
minutes into the second, he 
knocked down a 3-pointer to 
cut a seven-point deficit to four. 
After a defensive stop on the 
next possession, he grabbed the 
rebound, rushed up the court 
and turned a head of steam into 
an and-one layup.
Brazdeikis yelled and flexed 
his arms as Teske gave him an 
enthusiastic chest-bump. Back 
was his signature celebration. 
Back was the intensity and the 
fire that defines his game. Back 
when Michigan needed it most.
“He’s not a guy that carries 
a lot of baggage around with 

him,” said Wolverines coach 
John Beilein. “ … He’s pretty 
good at moving on to the next 
play. He was the only one that 
was 
making 
plays 
at 
times 
this game.”
It 
was 
that 
kind 
of 
night 
for 
Michigan. 
It shot just 34 
percent from the 
field and 3-of-
22 from outside. 
Brazdeikis 
put 
up an 18-point 
and 
11-rebound 
double-double, but on an ugly 
4-of-18 line. Still, he never 
stopped attacking, resulting in 
a 9-for-11 showing from the foul 
line.
And so it was Brazdeikis who 

the Wolverines put their trust 
in to ice the game.
On their last possession, he 
caught the ball at the top of the 
key. Off a Jordan 
Poole 
screen, 
Golden Gopher 
defenders Gabe 
Kalscheur 
and 
Jordan Murphy 
both hedged on 
Brazdeikis as he 
powered to the 
hoop.
“It shows that 
Coach (Beilein) 
has 
confidence 
in him and so do we,” Teske 
said. “You know he’s going to 
make the right play. He drove 
and he had a good look at the 
basket.”
Brazdeikis’ 
layup 
was 

blocked, but that’s beside the 
point.
“We were trying to get Iggy 
isolated and get something 
in the lane so 
we had enough 
time 
to 
get 
an 
offensive 
rebound, 
don’t 
rush 
a 
3,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“(Brazdeikis 
is a) great foul 
shooter and guy 
that could finish 
at the rim, you 
don’t 
want 
to 
settle in that situation.”
Added Brazdeikis: “It means 
the world to me. I’m not going to 
shy away from moments like that, 
that’s just not who I am.”
None of this is to sugarcoat 

a 4-for-18 shooting night. After 
the loss to Wisconsin, Beilein 
noted that the Badgers were able 
to slow Brazdeikis by putting 
6-foot-10 Ethan Happ on him and 
flustering him with length. It’s 
clear that after 19 games, teams 
are beginning to develop adequate 
scouting reports on Brazdeikis, 
and Michigan will need him to 
adapt to them to continue his 
same level of success.
But even though Tuesday was 
far, far from Ignas Brazdeikis’ 
finest performance, it was one of 
his most defining.
Any player can have an off-
night, and Brazdeikis is hardly 
immune. But the confidence that 
sets apart the most elite scorers; 
the confidence that Brazdeikis 
has in droves?
It’s not going anywhere.

Minnesota was one second 
away from taking the No. 5 team 
in the country to overtime on its 
home court.
Then, 
a 
shot. 
A 
buzzer. 
Pandemonium. And a wait.
A 
long, 
excruciating 
wait 
for the Golden Gophers as the 
officials looked at every frame 
of redshirt junior wing Charles 
Matthews’ midrange jumper as 
time expired.
For four minutes, Minnesota’s 
fate hung in the balance.
“We thought we was going 
to overtime,” said Minnesota 
forward 
Eric 
Curry. 
“ 
… 
Everybody thought we was going 
to overtime.”
The decision came, and the 
referee originally signaled no 
basket. Boos rained down on the 
floor as the Golden Gophers had, 
briefly, a gasp of life. Until the 

officials corrected themselves.
Call stands. Michigan wins.
Before that, the Wolverines 
had gone four minutes and 51 
seconds 
without 
scoring 
as 
Minnesota whittled away at a 
10-point deficit. As Michigan had 
empty possession after empty 
possession, the Golden Gophers 
found their guys, chipping at 
what had seemed like a safe lead 
until suddenly, the game was tied.
“I think it was more of just 
catching them off guard,” said 
Minnesota 
forward 
Jordan 
Murphy. “And making sure that 
we were getting baskets and 
buckets when we could and 
making sure we stayed composed 
down the stretch.”
It wasn’t as tough a task as it 
may have seemed — the Golden 
Gophers, after all, led for the 
first 25 minutes of the game. 
Shots weren’t falling for the 
Wolverines, 
and 
Minnesota 
disrupted them enough inside 
to 
keep 
them 
from getting too 
comfortable. 
When 
the 
shooting 
once 
again went cold, 
the 
Golden 
Gophers 
took 
advantage.
With 31 seconds 
left in the game, 
Minnesota passed 
the ball around 
the 
perimeter, 
desperate 
for 
a good look for 
three. Finally, it 
was guard Gabe 
Kalscheur 
— 
a 
freshman 
who 
had never been in 
a situation this big 
— who took it.
The 
Golden 
Gophers had all 

the momentum. The shot seemed 
destined to go in, and it did. The 
game was tied.
“Gabe obviously is a very 
professional type of guy,” Murphy 
said. “Keeps his composure, 
keeps very poised, so definitely a 
really good shooter.”
Michigan’s first attempt at the 
win was from freshman forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis, who tried a 
layup under the basket. Curry got 
the block.
This wasn’t the first time 
Curry was in a similar situation. 
Two years ago, Minnesota was 
facing Indiana, down one with 
just three seconds left. Curry, 
as a freshman, tipped a rebound 
right to a teammate, who hit a 
jumper for the win. Curry knew 
what the Golden Gophers had to 
do — get the rebound, finish the 
possession.
Instead, Matthews got the ball, 
and the rest was history.
“We’re not gonna put anything 
on the refs,” Curry said. “ … 
We should’ve got the rebound, 
finished 
the 
possession, 
we 
always preached it all year long. 
Finish the possession.”
As those four excruciating 
minutes passed, with the refs 
reviewing every angle of a slowed-
down Matthews releasing the 
ball, all Minnesota could do was 
stand and wait and hope.
A few milliseconds made the 
difference between what could 
have been one of the Golden 
Gophers’ biggest performances in 
years and just another game that 
ended in heartbreak.
When 
Minnesota 
coach 
Richard Pitino was asked if he 
thought the call was correct, he 
couldn’t bear to deal with the 
what-ifs. Instead, he offered up 
eight words.
“Doesn’t matter. It was close. It 
doesn’t matter.”

On Connie 
Converse, 
considering 
the lilies


D

ear Friends and Family,

In our current political climate, everybody 
is more than aware the world is being ravaged by none 
other than a deadly, vicious virus: angry, annoying femi-
nists. These women are demanding equal rights, rioting 
on the streets, speaking out against abuse from their 
male counterparts and drilling for an end to gender dis-
crimination. Demanding respect — as if they deserve that. 
As if they’ve earned it. I have always considered myself 
to be clean of the illness they call “feminism,” with my 
life devoted to actively trying to avoid the contagion. To 
me, those afflicted represented the lowest level of society 
— the self-proclaimed victims who do nothing but com-
plain.
Feminism is a disease that leeches onto women’s souls 
— making its victims utterly undesirable to the men who 
are forced to listen to their constant nagging. It’s an 
instant repellent. For research purposes, I reached out to 
Chloe Findling, a well-known victim of feminism for an 
interview. The interview itself had to be conducted over 
the phone, as I could not risk catching the disease myself. 
Findling, a freshman at Scripps College, was diagnosed 
with Class-A feminism, or, the scientific term Feminista 
Fatalis, when she just a vulnerable, unsure 14-year-old.
When describing her mind state prior to her exposure, 
Chloe explained, “When I came to high school, I had a 
really hard time with boys because I was insecure and I 
thought I could mold an identity for myself that was not 
like ‘most girls’ — which made me secretly malicious.” 
When asking what she meant by this, Findling described 
an urge to manipulate her female friends at the benefit of 
the men she desperately craved the approval of.
This helpless mind state was the perfect storm for the 
feminist plague to pry into Chloe’s mental stability. The 
warning signs were subtle — at first, she had no way to 
identify the sickness infiltrating her wellbeing. Instead, 
she only started noticing symptoms when the feminism 
had already secured its power over her central nervous 
system. Her brain started identifying what she referred 
to as “inherent sexism,” a myth fabricated by feminists 
to validate their so-called “victimhood.” Once Findling 
recognized this, she felt the uncontrollable urge to spread 
her disgusting feminist germs to other innocent members 
of society. She marketed her contagion as “empower-
ment,” using the mantra, “Empowered women empower 
women” to draw more victims in.
She discussed her experience of coming to terms with 
the illness taking hold of her body, saying, “I found com-
fort in myself and in my gender, in my personality, in my 
beliefs, in everything I stood for. I became who I really 
am, and now I use my gender as something that empow-
ers me, instead of letting it push me to be something I’m 
not.”
The feeling Chloe described is one very common of 
those affected by the painful disease. Doctors describe 
the process of contracting feminism as a gradual rewir-
ing of the brain, causing symptoms such confidence and 
determination to arise from the illness’ destruction. As 

a direct result of this, many victims find themselves in 
a warped mental state, motivated to bring down the so-
called “patriarchy.”
While Chloe painted her exposure to feminism and its 
side effects as liberating, I knew her lies were just a side 
effect of the plague. I stopped listening to her speak after 
less than two minutes of the interview — her statements 
were so foreign to me that it sounded as if she was speak-
ing in tongues. Everyone knows feminism manipulates 
the mind — halting all ability to conduct rational thought. 
As second class, inferior citizens, a woman could never 
truly feel comfortable in her own skin. Even the thought 
of that sounded absurd. My discussion with Chloe served 
as a symbol of the feminist deceit, so I stayed as far away 
from her as possible. I refused to fall victim to the disease.
But I have been plagued.
I tried to keep my health as long as possible. I took all of 
the safety precautions necessary. I scrubbed my floor daily 
on my hands and knees, rubbing extra hard to make sure 
no feminist bacteria grew. I shaved morning and night to 
make sure I was not mistaken for an armpit-haired femi-
nist killjoy. I rallied for candidates who wanted to take 
away women’s reproductive rights. I gave up the 28 cents 
I should have received myself to far more deserving male 
coworkers. I even wore face masks in public so that femi-
nist air wouldn’t penetrate my healthy skin.
But therein lies my fatal mistake. I did not wear my face 
masks in the comfort of my own home. How was I sup-
posed to know that a victim of feminism was in front of 
my eyes this entire time?
My mom never discussed her illness — it all hap-
pened so quickly. To be honest, I’m not even sure 
she was aware of how ill she was until the encoun-
ter. Feminism is a clever disease. It affects all of 
its victims differently, causing some to have more 
external symptoms than others. My mother’s 
sickness was internalized, making it much more 
difficult for people, including myself, to identify 
her suffering. Because of the illness’ artifice, I 
innocently brought up my encounter with Chloe 
to her, thinking she would rally behind me in my 
investigation of the most reckless of our time.
But I was wrong. Her mouth opened, and out 
poured pungent, powerful stenches of rationale. 
She preached, “Women deserve equal rights, end 
of story. Right now, society seems pretty messed 
up, and I really hope our future brings a brighter, 
more equal atmosphere for women in all spheres 
of influence.”
I was shocked. I was confused. I started to cry. 
When I went to wipe the stream of endless tears 
from my face, I made a traumatizing realization: I 
was not wearing my face mask.
I was plagued. The feminist disease hit me 
harder than any illness I had ever experienced. I 
had become a walking parasite. I felt the chemi-
cals rewire my brain, and suddenly my thoughts 
told me it was okay to believe in equality. Like 
Chloe, I was soon able to identify the sexism with-

in society, and I wanted a change. I was not inferior to any 
man. I could be whomever I wanted to be.
It no longer felt like my brain was being hijacked by 
invasive mutation. With each symptom becoming more 
powerful, feminism became a crucial part of my identity.
I later found out the feminist disease runs in my fam-
ily, though scientists have yet to prove it is hereditary. My 
grandma too is a feminist, demanding equal pay to her 
male counterparts as she continuously exceeded their 
performance in the workplace. Hearing this before would 
have caused me to disown her, but now that I am sick, I 
am incredibly proud of her efforts. It’s funny — my illness 
makes me feel strong rather than feeble. I guess that’s just 
a paradox left for scientists to figure out.
I’m sorry if I’m hurting anyone by announcing this 
to the world. I just couldn’t mask my disease anymore. 
Although I may be ostracized from society, condemned 
by the patriarchy, and exiled to a life of liberation, I felt 
as if you all deserved to know. I do warn you, though, the 
mutation is very powerful, and it’s coming whether you 
like it or not. Those affected, including myself, expect 
resistance. Nevertheless, the feminist disease will per-
sist. After all, the illness has grown an immunity to oppo-
sition.

Sincerely,
An ill-bodied, parasitic, toxic feminist (aka Andie 
Horowitz)

Wednesday, January 23, 2019 // The Statement 
3B

M

y blasé attitude toward New 
Year’s Eve was challenged while 
standing in the dairy aisle of the 
grocery store.
Before that moment, I have never been 
one to indulge in the holiday branded with 
sequin dresses, champagne flutes and a 
drunken chorus counting down to another 
year of obligations. The occasion never quite 
seemed to fulfill “An Affair to Remember’s” 
promise of finding romance atop the Empire 
State Building.
Yet, the disillusionment accompanied 
with New Year’s Eve unexpectedly returned 
to my mind last December. As my mother’s 
daughter, I was raised to always check the 
item’s expiration date while grocery shop-
ping. In accordance with her principle, I 
stretched my arm into the cooler scanning 
for the freshest gallon of milk, only to real-
ize the entire shelf was stamped with the 
imminence of 2019. 

All of the 2018 milk was gone. The 
dairy aisle had already moved on to 
the promise of a new year. There 
would never be another gallon of 
milk on the shelf expiring in 2018. I 
felt a fizzy sentimentality bubbling 
inside of me. Perhaps this was the 
feeling people seek to experience 
when the clock strikes midnight.
Standing before the milk and 
all of its oat, soy, almond and skim 
siblings, I decided I was going 
to wholeheartedly embrace New 
Year’s Eve this year. My family was 
headed to the beach to escape over-
cast Midwest skies and the hazy 
disorientation that accompanies 
the week between Christmas and 
New Year’s.
A perfect opportunity to give 
New Year’s Eve a second chance.
The night arrived and I donned 
my gauzy linen pants with an airy 
top. My mom told me I looked like 
Annie Hall if she was going to the 
beach. Diane Keaton is a legend, so 
I took her words as a compliment. 
Despite the fact we had been on 
vacation for nearly a week, my Irish 
complexion was barely sun kissed 
— I preferred to camp out under 
the beach umbrella. The thought 
of being kissed at midnight briefly 
wandered across my mind, before 
I realized my expectations were a 
construct of watching far too many 
romantic comedies.
 The spontaneity of my New 
Year’s Eve rested upon the resort’s 
banquet seating chart. As some-
one who has only ever attended 
one wedding and drools over Anna 
Wintour’s Met Gala seating chart, 
I was thrilled by the prospect of 
indulging in conversation with total 
strangers. Maybe I would meet my 
own Cary Grant. 
I found my seat and eagerly waited for my 
dashing “An Affair to Remember” moment. 
The hostesses swam through the tables 
guiding families to their seats. My eager-
ness resembled the novelty of watching pas-
sengers file onboard an airplane as you cross 
your fingers for an amiable person to fill the 
empty window seat next to you. 
A family moved through the crowd and 
paused at our table. I looked up, ready to 
lock eyes with the person who would prove 
to me the glamour of New Year’s Eve is not 
reserved for Deborah Kerr. Yet, my leading 
man was not a handsome Brit. As fate would 
reveal, I was seated across from a 12-year-
old boy.
His 
name 
was 
Daniel. 
Last 
name 
unknown. We were both seated at the end 
of the table, awkwardly too far away to be 
included in the “adult” conversation that 

our parents were already engaging in. I 
found myself staring at the buffet fixings on 
my plate. Lobster Imperial. Sushi. Lasagna. 
Hummus. It looked like Epcot had spewed 
all over my plate.
I should add this experience was made 
even more bizarre by the theme of the ban-
quet: medieval renaissance. Waiters donned 
knight costumes and the call of bugle horns 
bellowed throughout the hall.
So there we sat, Daniel nibbling on his 
kosher chips and salsa with the muted dia-
logue of his mother explaining the stress of 
bar mitzvah season on the Upper West Side 
floating in the background.
I figured I would introduce myself since 
our eight-year age difference seemingly bur-
dened me with the responsibility to lead the 
conversation. I would characterize the dis-
course that ensued as more of an interview. I 
would ask questions and he would respond.
I asked him what he did for fun and soon 
learned he enjoyed playing chess. I harkened 
back to my limited exposure to the game as 
an elementary school student during recess 
— Daniel was quick to correct me that he is a 
competitive chess player.
The rest of dinner conversation was check-
ered with Daniel explaining the lifestyle of 
a burgeoning chess champion. He outlined 
his rigorous practice schedule with both a 
private chess coach and online portal only 
accessible to ranked players. He described 
his plans to travel to Norway to compete 
against chess grandmasters in a tourna-
ment. I learned about the governing bodies 
of the chess world — both domestically and 
internationally. He revealed tournament 
scandals, like the time a player flipped the 
entire chess board over in frustration mid-
game. He noted the disputed rules of chess 
and how computers have made gameplay 
more vulnerable to cheating. And thanks to 
our conversation, I now know the best chess 
players are from Turkey and Scandinavia, 
but the United States holds its own alright.
This conversation lasted until Daniel 
cleared his plate and left to go play pool. I 
say this nonchalantly, because by the end of 
our conversation on strategy games, I would 
not have expected anything less from the 
boy I had just met. 
I soon excused myself, too, bid farewell 
to my parents and schlepped off to my hotel 
room well before midnight.
 There I found myself lying on the bed 
watching Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen 
head into the fourth hour of their New 
Year’s Eve broadcast. As “Auld Lang Syne” 
began to hum from the televised streets of 
Times Square to my hotel room, I realized 
while I would likely never see Daniel again, 
he was certainly an acquaintance I would 
not forget. Maybe New Year’s Eve isn’t about 
finding love. Maybe instead it is a night that 
glimmers with the hope of witnessing some-
thing unforgettable.

“Perhaps this 

was the feeling 

people seek 

to experience 

when the 

clock strikes 

midnight.”


I

f I have two things to 

thank for introducing 

me to the heavenly spir-

it that is Connie Converse, they 

are Spotify’s Discover Weekly 

algorithm and The New Yorker.

Last summer, deciding to 

throw caution and typical career 

paths to the wind, I packed my 

bags and flew to Dehradun, 

India. There I worked for Anku-

ri, a women’s rights non-prof-

it that teaches high school 

English. In a foreign country, 

hundreds of miles from friends, 

family and any modicum of 

Midwestern security, I craved a 

sense of familiarity. Before class 

on a balmy Monday in August, I 

let my eyes scan my laptop case, 

relishing the elements of home my 

laptop stickers attempt to encapsulate 

— stickers from my friend’s clothing 

line, a tantalizing pizza restaurant on 

Vernor Highway in Detroit (if there’s 

one thing India lacks, it’s good pizza), 

The Michigan Daily.

I open my laptop, immediately 

throw earbuds in and open Spotify. 

As I’m wont to do, I fall back on music 

as a coping mechanism for change. By 

diving into Spotify’s Discover Weekly 

playlist — a personalized mix of music 

based on user listening habits — I feel 

like I’m better prepared to embrace 

new challenges and experiences in 

the same manner I would embrace 

new genres and sounds. With it being 

a Monday, my new playlist is ready for 

consumption and I am starving.

I hit shuffle to wet my appetite. A 

few songs roll by — one sadboi moan-

ing into a compression-soaked micro-

phone, one B-side by a Canadian alt 

group, one ’90s Queen of Rap wring-

ing out syllables like a wet towel.

Then, I hear a muffled male voice 

some 20 or so feet away from the 

microphone:

“Well she has one that she hasn’t 

sung yet.”

Another voice inquires:

“Have you?”

Then the real subject, the one 

behind the mic, the object of this per-

sistent questioning, pushes back on 

the previous two:

“Well I’d rather not try that, actu-

ally. I haven’t tried it enough more to- 

to do it well.”

Devilishly, another far 

away female voice proposes a 

solution to the singer’s appre-

hension:

“Why don’t you just sing it 

and we won’t record it?”

However, I know she’s 

lying. Otherwise the con-

versation wouldn’t be in my 

headphones, funneling into 

my brain. Mischievous, to 

say the least.

Unbeknownst to her, the 

musician 
acquiesces 
and 

begins to perform. She clears 

her throat. A bass note is 

plucked. Then the first beat 

of a four beat bar is heard on 

an acoustic guitar. As a gui-

tarist myself who has plenty 

of songs he can’t remember, 

the action is familiar. She’s 

getting herself started, firing 

the engine in hopes of head-

ing somewhere. She then 

interrupts herself for a spe-

cial announcement:

“This has a biblical text.”

And what comes next 

could have been handed 

down to Moses by what my 

grandma believes to be an 

old, white-haired, white guy 

in the sky. The guitar intro 

screams ’60s folk record-

ings, probably an old Martin 

acoustic guitar rendition of 

an early 20th century folk 

song. I remember growing 

up, two or three years old 

in the townhouse on Starr 

Road, building cities using 

Thomas the Tank Engine 

tracks, Legos and alphabet 

blocks and listening to The 

Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan on 

my dad’s turntable. Being 

inculcated with the ’60s folk

On Connie Converse, considering the lilies


revival at a very young age, 

I automatically thought this 

must be from that era of 

musicians, gleaming what-

ever they can from Harry 

Smith ’s Anthology of Ameri-

can Folk Music.

But as the song winds up, 

the guitar becomes more 

intricate. In addition, the 

voice is beyond anything I’ve 

ever heard before. It is gentle 

and soothing like the chime 

of a wind-up snow globe, yet 

there’s a fire burning under-

neath, an urgency to her 

tone and lyrics that beg the 

listener to lean in. A minute 

in, the song kicks into high 

gear, with elaborate picking 

patterns, a faster tempo and 

that voice jumping all over 

the scales, pontificating on 

the demure lifestyle of flow-

ers in the valley.

I’m spellbound. I close my 

Google Doc and immediately 

pine to know who this elu-

sive folk icon is. Maybe it’s a 

modern-day contemporary 

of Joan Baez, distorting the 

recording to sound lofi and 

InDiE. The song is “I Have 

Considered the Lilies” from 

the album How Sad, How 

Lovely by Connie Converse. 

The name alone casts me 

back to middle school, where 

I began my trend of always 

wearing high top Converse 

sneakers, despite their lack 

of an arch that made my feet 

ache constantly.

A quick Google search 

shows Converse to be a folk 

musician — my musical era 

guess was correct— but from 

earlier than Baez, Dylan 

and the ’60s folk revival in general. 

In using one of my 10 precious, free 

monthly articles to find out more, the 

essay “Connie Converse’s Time Has 

Come” by music historian Howard 

Fishman in The New Yorker paints 

her as a leading pioneer in the sing-

er-songwriter movement of the late 

’50s. However, few knew who she 

was until the late 2000s. This con-

fuses me. How can a musician be a 

pioneer without garnering a certain 

amount of fame? However, the article 

quickly informs me Converse walked 

into obscurity, quitting music in 1961, 

so the likes of Dylan, Baez and more 

could run.

There are so many stories of fans 

wanting to find their idols who don’t 

want to be found. Luckily, if it was the 

early ’60s and I was obsessed with 

Converse as I am now, I wouldn’t 

have to look very far to meet her. After 

leaving New York in ’61, Converse 

moved to Ann Arbor.
C

rucial to telling Converse’s 

story is the acknowl-

edgement that she was 

a remarkably talented learner — 

adapting and achieving mastery in 

anything she set her mind to. Hers is 

also a story of what-ifs. As someone 

encountering her story some 50 years 

later, I read every crossroad Converse 

encountered like a Choose Your Own 

Adventure book. I want to tell her, 

“Just stick it out, the folk revival is 

around the corner! Don’t leave New 

York just yet!” But history doesn’t 

afford those privileges.

Born Elizabeth Eaton Converse in 

1924, she grew up in Laconia, N.H. 

and excelled in nearly every field of 

academic study, eventually earning 

the title of valedictorian of her high 

school class. With a full-ride schol-

arship to Mount Holyoke College, a 

private women’s liberal arts college in 

South Hadley, Massachusetts, Con-

verse seemed destined to thrive in 

higher education.

“In 2004 when she was played on ‘Spinning 

on Air,’ that was her first exposure to radio and I 

just still consider myself very lucky to have heard 

it, and I was very moved by it, and it just felt like 

very important music,” Dzula said. “I remember 

thinking at the time that, ‘Well this is such amaz-

ing music, any day now someone’s going to release 

the album,’ and that just didn’t happen.”

Four years after Dzula first heard Converse’s 

recordings, he “summoned the courage” to con-

tact Deitch with the proposal of releasing his 

recordings. Deitch directed Dzula to Converse’s 

brother, Phil Converse, a prominent professor of 

political science and sociology at the University 

of Michigan and the owner of Converse’s estate. 

With help from Deitch and Phil, Dzula compiled 

a series of recordings and founded Squirrel Thing 

Records for the purpose of releasing the album 

How Sad, How Lovely in 2009.

In the interview, he said her musical style is 

unlike what was coming out of New York during 

the time and that poignant original material, 

despite many folk singers covering older stan-

dards, helps her connect with a modern audience.

“I think it’s very easy for people to see them-

selves in her, in her story and in her music,” Dzula 

said. “I think that just has to do with the quality 

and depth of ideas that she puts forth as a song-

writer. If you think about the ’50s being sort of 

this glossy commercialized era, there’s something 

a bit darker, a bit more honest about her music and 

I think that’s interesting and I think that’s in some 

sense what people respond to.”

Dzula’s words resonate with me wholeheart-

edly. Beyond her guitar technique, which, as a 

guitarist, are enough to keep me enraptured, Con-

verse’s lyrics are poetry. Her songs grapple with 

universal concepts with poignant, succinct accu-

racy. The track “How Sad, How Lovely,” which 

begins with the line “How sad, how lovely / how 

short, how sweet / to see that sunset / at the end of 

the street,” casts me back to my childhood, learn-

ing the purpose of a wake at my first funeral — my 

grandfather’s. Though a somber occasion with 

tears flowing continuously, loved ones attempted 

to focus on the joy my grandpa brought into this 

world instead of dwelling on the sadness of his 

absence. Converse understood this outlook on 

life and summarized it perfectly. A sunset doesn’t 

last for long but it’s lovely while it’s around. While 

Dzula may not have the same specific memory 

association, I would be hard pressed to believe he 

doesn’t see truth in this line.

Despite this apparent connection to her modern 

fan base, one album of archival recordings does 

not appease a fan base hungry for more. However, 

this may soon change. Dzula is currently in talks 

with Converse’s estate to publish a 5 LP box set 

featuring recordings of Converse 

that have yet to see the light of 

day. If all goes according to Dzula’s 

plan, the LP set would include “her 

home recordings … other demos 

and oddities … Gene Deitch’s own 

recordings” and more.
F

ed up with no one want-

ing to publish her music, 

Converse arrived at the 

University of Michigan, found her 

brother and set out to make a name 

for herself in academia. Just as she 

had done in New York, Converse 

made her way into an exclusive 

echelon of people with very little 

prior knowledge or expertise. In 

New York, it was the beatniks and 

music scene. In Ann Arbor, she 

had to acclimate to an academic 

environment. In a typical Converse 

fashion, she exceeded anyone’s 

expectations of her.

During the late ’50s and early 

’60s, many women were rele-

gated to the role of secretary in 

male-dominated business environ-

ments. While Converse acquiesced 

to this job at first, her aspirations 

and talents quickly grew out of the 

position. With very little know-how in the field 

of political science — one of her brother’s areas of 

expertise — Converse became a writer and, even-

tually, the managing editor at the University of 

Michigan’s Journal of Conflict Resolution in 1963.

Five years after she became managing editor, 

she published a retrospective piece in the jour-

nal, analyzing the common themes of articles 

published during her tenure and positing her sug-

gestions for the future of the journal. In her intro-

duction, Converse’s eloquent and smart prose 

gives off the air of someone who has been steeped 

in political science for years.

“A member of the JCR editorial board recently 

suggested that the journal’s subtitle be changed 

from ‘a quarterly for research related to war and 

peace’ to ‘a quarterly for research related to revo-

lution and world development,’ ” Converse wrote. 

“The suggestion reflects a shift in salience, over 

the past decade, from the H-bomb to the war in 

Vietnam. My own proposal for a new subtitle at 

this point might be ‘a quarterly for research relat-

ed to the war of all against all and the truce of 

some with some.’ ”

However, her jobs on campus and her activism 

eventually wore Converse’s creative and men-

tal spirits down. She reportedly stopped writing 

music not long after she arrived in Ann Arbor.

essay, she began drinking and smok-

ing heavily. Then, in 1974, while her 

brother and his family were on sum-

mer vacation, she packed up her things 

and penned a few letters to family and 

friends, begging them to “let me go. Let 

me be if I can. Let me not be if I can’t … 

Human society fascinates me and awes 

me and fills me with grief and joy; I just 

can’t find my place to plug into it.” After 

sending the letters, she drove off once 

again, leaving Ann Arbor behind.

This time, no one knew where she 

was heading. Her final what-if.

Her brother assumed she commit-

ted suicide. Knowing his sister, he 

thought Converse probably didn’t want 

to be found if she was still alive and he 

respected that decision.

To this day, no one knows if Connie 

Converse is alive or dead.
H

oward Fishman’s story of 

discovering 
Converse’s 

album on Squirrel Thing is 

similar to mine and Dzula’s — all three 

of us being immediately enraptured 

upon listening. He first heard her song 

“Talkin’ Like You” at a party in 2010 and 

was thrown into a state of utter euphoria 

by her bluesy finger-picking, her clear-

as-day voice and the simple fact that 

nothing sounds like it, no matter how 

many comparisons you draw.

“I find her work to be complete-

ly original and astoundingly unique,” 

Fishman said. “I think it’s very original 

in a timeless way.”

Like the best calls to action, Fishman 

wanted to know more about Converse 

than what was on the Squirrel Thing 

website. He immediately tracked down 

her living family members, including 

Converse’s brother, and began to piece 

together her story. A musician himself, 

Fishman recorded an album of his own 

performances based on manuscripts of 

her later piano and voice compositions. 

He is also currently in the process of 

writing a book about her life.

His 
most 
measurable 
creative 

endeavor, in his effort to keep Con-

verse’s legacy alive, has been his play “A 

Star Has Burnt My Eye,” which debuted 

at the Public Theater in New York City. 

The current draft takes the form of a 

non-fiction dramatic concert, with Fish-

man narrating her story and utilizing 

pictures and artwork as well as excerpts 

from her personal letters and live per-

formances.

“The only reason behind my writing the play 

in the first place was to get the word out about 

her music and the fact that I believe she deserves 

much greater recognition than what she had,” 

Fishman said. “The piece evolved from concerts 

I was doing of her music with my band and then 

telling her story inbetween the songs and that 

grew into the play.”

Similar to Dzula, Fishman admires her abili-

ty to accomplish anything she desired, whether 

it was writing music or editing a political science 

journal. 

“She took seriously everything she did and did 

a lot of different things in her life,” Fishman said. 

“I think that she was fully committed to every 

endeavor that she set her mind to and I have no 

doubt that the work that she was doing for the 

journal was exemplary. I’m sure it was above and 

beyond what anyone expected her to do.”

While the drama and intrigue of her disap-

pearance makes for great TV or film, Fishman 

said he believes her music should be front and 

center when discussing Converse.

“It’s sad, but I think that the fact that she dis-

appeared is not the most interesting thing about 

her story or about her, and I think that it can take 

away from attention to the music, which is what 

I feel is her greatest legacy,” Fishman said. “I 

think she just has that kind of magnetic pull and 

it pulled me in and it just hasn’t let go yet.”
T

hroughout her life, Converse dis-

played a sense of passion that tran-

scends a common desire for fame. She 

excelled in her academic studies, developed a 

musical style all her own while being completely 

self-taught, wrote beautifully haunting lyrics on 

the momentary joys of life, became the manag-

ing editor of a prominent political science jour-

nal with little experience and didn’t let people’s 

impressions of her stand between her and her 

goals.

Beyond how passionate she was about every 

path she went down, even more 

impressive is her astounding cour-

age. Before I left for India last 

summer, I thought every day about 

why it was a mistake. What if I 

cost myself a valuable internship 

at home? What if my entire life is 

based on this moment and I choose 

the wrong path? What if I fail?

Despite a story filled to the brim 

with what-ifs, Converse knew what 

she wanted out of life and had the 

courage to leave everything behind 

to accomplish it. She left Mount 

Holyoke for New York, she left New 

York for Ann Arbor and finally she 

left Ann Arbor for an unknown destination and 

did so with unwavering confidence and determi-

nation. Converse helped me become self-assured 

in my decision and make the best of my experi-

ence abroad by dedicating myself to my work, no 

matter what what-ifs come after.

Ultimately, what I can’t shake about Con-

verse’s legacy, beyond her tragic yet inspiring 

story, is how her music inspires others to create 

something new and beautiful. Dzula founded 

an entire record company to publish Converse’s 

music and make people understand how brilliant 

she was. Fishman performed concerts of her 

music, is working on a book about her life and 

wrote an entire play just to tell the world about 

Connie Converse and why she deserves recogni-

tion and respect.

Though I consider myself a musician and 

playwright, I’ve always been a piss-poor draw-

er. I couldn’t color inside the lines if you paid 

me (and my Kindergarten teacher tried to). But 

after listening to “I Have Considered the Lilies” 

multiple times over, a powerful force came over 

me — one endowed with confidence and a cre-

ative spirit. I reached for the nearest pen and a 

sketchbook that had been gathering dust on my 

shelf; its pages stuck together a bit. I googled one 

of the few photos of Converse’s performance on 

CBS’s “Morning Show,” the segment that many 

assumed would rocket her to stardom and found 

one that piqued my interest — her expression 

intent and her fingers resting gingerly on the 

neck of the guitar. I spent an hour and a half that 

day, outlining her face with its sharp cheekbones, 

her hair, poised and sculpted to her standards, 

and her guitar resting between her arms. While 

the sketch certainly isn’t ending up in the MoMA 

anytime soon, Converse’s music, like it did to 

Dzula and Fishman, gave me the same passion 

and courage she had to step out of my comfort 

zone and create. Thank you, Connie Converse, 

for considering the lilies when the whole world 

was “all against all.”

S T A T E M E N T :

Andrew Rogers, a staff organist at 
the Michigan Theater, first became in-
terested in the organ at a chapel at one 
of his spiritual retreats before coming to 
the Michigan Theater. 
 “I started to enjoy some of the sounds 
of the organ but then I got interested in 
wanting to learn how to play,” Rogers said. 
“Music was always in the background. I 
worked for a travel agency and I had (a) 
church job and music got squeezed in 
between everything else. I quit the travel 
agency so I could do more programs … 
So now it was my opportunity to make 
a living out of music rather than just a 
hobby. I was able to come down here and 
start playing before films and occasion-
ally travel doing silent films.”
 During these silent films accompani-
ments, Rogers acts a live score — choos-
ing how to incorporate his music into 
the film and acting almost as a director.
 “For instance, in Hitchcock’s ‘The 
Lodger’, there’s a girl in the film and 
you’re not sure if she’s safe around the 
lodger or not, so I can really choose mu-
sically, when I will let the audience know 
she’s safe,” Rogers said. “Every time I 
do a film (it’s) a little different because 
the way I incorporate the melodies will 
change each time.” 
 While Rogers does spend his time ac-
companying silent films, his job at the 
Michigan Theater gives him the rare op-
portunity to play on one of 40 organs in 
the country that are still in their original 
home. 
 “Other (organs) have fallen into disuse, 
(been) removed, split up for parts to go 
into other organs or moved into differ-
ent locations like schools or churches,” 
Rogers said. “It’s really the interest and 
foresight of the theater that have kept it 
up. So whatever I say about the organ or 
my role here it’s really the theater that 
backs the organ and keeps it running.”
