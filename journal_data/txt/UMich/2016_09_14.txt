Author Malcolm Gladwell’s 

lecture on the risks and 
realities of entrepreneurship 
Tuesday drew an audience 
large enough to fill Hill 
Auditorium.

The talk, which explored 

the careers of scientist Emil 
Freireich who helped invent 
modern chemotherapy; Steve 
Jobs, who founded Apple; and 
Ingvar Kamprad, who founded 
IKEA, was part of The Joseph 
and Sally Handleman Lecture 
Series hosted by the Ross 
School of Business.

Gladwell 
challenged 

the 
audience 
to 

reframe 
the 
traditional 

discourse 
surrounding 

entrepreneurship, 
encouraging them to consider 
the social implications as well.

“I think we spend a lot of time 

talking about the innovation 
part 
of 
entrepreneurship 

and not enough time talking 
about 
the 
social 
part 
of 

entrepreneurship,” 
Gladwell 

said. “That’s what I want to 
talk about this evening.”

He 
added 
that 

entrepreneurs 
are 
defined 

by 
exigency 
rather 
than 

competence 
or 
resources, 

highlighting 
Jobs’ 
attempt 

to produce the Macintosh 
computer 
as 
quickly 
as 

possible.

“That’s what sets (Jobs) 

apart, that sense of urgency,” 

Gladwell said. “That’s what 
gives an entrepreneur their 
sense of direction and their 
sense of purpose.”

He 
also 
outlined 
three 

common 
characteristics 

shared by all entrepreneurs: 
openness 
to 
creativity, 

conscientiousness 
and 

disagreeableness in terms of 

a disregard for the approval 
of others. To illustrate this 
notion of disagreeableness, he 
pointed to Freireich’s struggle 
with the medical community’s 
disapproval and accusations 
of immorality.

Despite 
this 
obstacle, 

Freireich 
continued 
his 

groundbreaking work.

“If 
Freireich 
needed 

approval, leukemia would still 
exist,” he said.

Gladwell said a successful 

entrepreneur believes in the 
nature of a dynamic society, 
a vision which fuels the 
entrepreneur to implement 
change.

Sixty-two 
percent 
of 

Michigan 
students 
graduate 

with debt of about $29,450 — 
making the state the ninth-
highest in the nation for student 
debt — according to a new report 
from the Michigan League for 
Public Policy, a nonpartisan 
economic policy institute.

The report pointed to several 

possible reasons for the debt, 
including rising tuition and 
stagnant levels of federal and 
state aid.

Since 2003, public tuition 

has increased by 100 to 150 
percent on average in Michigan. 
Meanwhile, in 2003, the Pell 
grant covered 40 to 66 percent 
of tuition. Now, the grant covers 
less than 40 percent at nearly 
all Michigan universities. At 
the University of Michigan 
specifically, in 2015, the federal 
Pell grant covered 26 percent of 
tuition.

Michigan’s 
investment 
in 

need-based financial aid grants 
has also fallen since the 1990s, 
even amid raising tuition. The 
state spends less per student on

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Democratic vice presidential nominee, speaks to University of Michigan students and the Ann Arbor community on the Diag Tuesday. 

Democratic 
officials 

encouraged Wolverines to follow 
their instincts and “go blue” 
this election Tuesday afternoon 
when Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), 

the Democratic vice presidential 
nominee, visited the University 
of Michigan’s campus to give a 
speech on the Diag.

Kaine’s visit marks the first 

time Hillary Clinton’s campaign 
has visited campus and the vice 
presidential 
nominee’s 
second 

time in the state, which went to 

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 
the Democratic primary, partially 
due to young voters. Kaine’s last 
stop in Michigan was in early 
August in Grand Rapids.

Before heading to the rally on 

the Diag, the vice presidential 
nominee first went to Espresso 
Royale on State Street, where he 

met with students as well as Ann 
Arbor residents.

Much of Kaine’s speech centered 

on student debt and bolstering 
Clinton’s higher education reform 
plan, along with civil rights and 
the importance of Michigan as 
a swing state. Speaking before

Men and women self-rate 

their health differently — and 
this might explain in part why 
women live longer — according 
to a recent University of 
Michigan study.

The study found women 

rate themselves as less healthy 
more often than men, even 
though women tend to live 
longer. The study, therefore, 
could predict mortality better 
in men who viewed themselves 
as extremely healthy, perhaps 
because they were more likely 
not to seek medical help.

Initially designed to 

compare health between 
Black and white people, the 
study followed 1,500 adults 
ages 66 and older for three 
years between 2001 and 2004 
and discovered that gender 
differences play a large role in 
subjectively predicting risk of 
mortality later in life.

“Regardless of the domain, 

women perceive their health 
being poorer — if it is mental 
health, if it quality of life, if 
it is anxiety or depression,

The University of Michigan’s 

Board of Regents will vote 
Thursday 
on 
a 
proposed 

renovation and addition to the 
Edward Henry Kraus Building, 
as well as an expansion and 
renovation to the W.K. Kellogg 
Institute and Dental Building.

Proposed 
changes 
to 
the 

Kellogg 
Institute 
include 

renovating 
the 
building 
to 

be better prepared for future 
growth of academic, research 
and clinical programs. This 
project would add 37,000 gross 
square feet and a new freight 
elevator, and would address 
maintenance issues regarding 
the building’s electrical and 
plumbing systems.

The project would create a 

“more 
welcoming, 
accessible 

facility with an improved patient 
entrance; 
modern 
teaching 

clinics with flexible furniture 
and equipment that can be 
reconfigured as needs change,” 
according to the action request 
on the agenda.

Renovations to the Kellogg 

Institute and Dental Building are 
estimated to cost $122 million.

The proposed changes to the 

Kraus Building would include 
relocating 
the 
Department 

of Ecology and Evolutionary 
Biology and the Department 
of 
Molecular, 
Cellular 
and 

Developmental Biology to the 
Biological 
Science 
Building, 

which 
is 
currently 
under 

construction.

The project would enable 

the School of Kinesiology to 
consolidate its programs and 
operations in the Kinesiology 
Building, the Central Campus 
Recreation Building and the 
Kraus Building to provide space 
for future growth. The Kraus 
Building changes are projected 
to cost $120 million.

Proposed bylaw changes
The board will also vote on 

several proposed changes to the 
Board of Regents bylaws — the 
governing powers allocated to 
the regents.

The first change would add 

language to the bylaws that 
ensure 
executive 
members 

reach out to students when 
making decisions on behalf 
of the student body. Central 
Student Government suggested 
the change because student 
voices are valuable to University 
decision-making, CSG President 
David Schafer said.

“We just wanted to reaffirm 

the importance of including 
student voices in University 
matters and decisions,” Schafer 
said. “It was all of us coming 
together 
saying 
‘Yes, 
we 

acknowledge that student voice 
is important’ and going from 
there.”

The 
second 
change 

would 
ensure 
no 
student 

is 
recommended 
for 
a 

degree until the student’s 
requirements for the degree 
have been met. An additional 
proposal would allow eight 
members of the faculty to 
be appointed to the School 
of 
Nursing 
Executive 

Committee by the board, an 
increase from six members in 
the past.

Accompanying 
these 

proposals, the board will 
also vote on a proposed 
$90 
million 
construction 

project on the University of 
Michigan-Dearborn campus, 
which would construct a new 
building to replace its current 
Engineering Lab.

This new building would 

include 
new 
teaching 

laboratories 
designed 
to 

complement 
more 
product 

development-oriented 
laboratories 
of

and 
aims

For University of Michigan 

students who worked up an appetite 

from start of the second week of class, 

Pancheros Mexican Grill on South 

University Avenue offered some relief 

Tuesday in the form of $1 burritos 

between 2 and 4 p.m.

After seeing advertisements 

on social media or hearing about 

the promotion through word of 

mouth, students like Public Policy 

junior Emily Fulks decided to take 

advantage of the opportunity for a 

discounted meal.

Fulks said she saw the 

advertisement on a Facebook post and 

decided to head down to Pancheros to 

get some food.

“I am very hype for this burrito, 

because I love the guacamole they 

have here at Pancheros,” Fulks said.

By 2:10 p.m. — just 10 minutes into 

the promotion — the line had already 

stretched out the door and down 

South University almost all the way to 

South Forest Avenue. While the line 

was long, Business sophomore Siva 

Kodali said he got there at 1:45 p.m. 

and managed to move through it and 

get his food in about 30 minutes. 

“I mean, it’s one dollar, might as 

well,” Kodali said.

Similarly, Engineering freshman 

Robby Hermanoff saw the promotion 

on Instagram and said he was looking 

forward to a cost-effective meal.

“I’m very excited for the $1 

burrito; I actually only have one 

dollar in my wallet so I’m hoping 

there’s no sales tax,” Hermanoff said.

In addition to the $1 burritos, 

Pancheros also offered a choice of a 

free T-shirt, pair of sunglasses or a 

string bag featuring the restaurant’s 

logo to customers when they got to 

the front of the line. The promotion 

was done in partnership with local 

sports radio station 97.1 The Ticket, 

according to CBS Detroit.

“Entrepreneurs 
believe 
in 

the inherent volatility of the 
world,” he said.

LSA 
freshman 
Jillian 

Gordner commented that the 

business lens was an interesting 
way 
to 
examine 
Gladwell’s 

work, 
and 
she 
found 
his 

approach to entrepreneurship 
unique.

“I haven’t heard him speak 

much in an entrepreneurship 
context,” she said.” It was a cool 
way to use entrepreneur a lot 

of different ways, and I think 
what he has to say is relevant 
to everyone in all educational 
domains.”

However, LSA senior Anu 

Vora said she wished Gladwell 
would 
have 
discussed 
a 

subject 
he’s 
more 
familiar 

with himself, noting that she 

does not consider him to be an 
entrepreneur.

“He’s a very creative writer 

in 
journalism,” 
Vora 
said. 

“At the same time, I don’t 
necessarily agree that you can 
boil 
entrepreneurship 
down 

into three qualities. There’s a 
lot more that goes into being 

an entrepreneur, which I’ve 
learned 
firsthand 
working 

with 
startups 
on 
campus 

and growing up in a very 
entrepreneurial home. It’s not 
possible to accommodate all 
entrepreneurs in this model.”

However, 
Business 

sophomore 
Becca 
Rudman 

found 
herself 
inspired 
by 

Gladwell, 
reconsidering 
her 

possible involvement in the 
world of entrepreneurship given 
the challenges and personality 
types Gladwell outlined.

“It made me question whether 

I could be an entrepreneur,” she 
said.

he took the stage, LSA junior 
Shavon Edwards emphasized the 
importance of voting for Clinton 
because of her commitment to 
higher education.

“As 
students, 
affordability 

of college is a huge issue,” 
Edwards said. “Now we have 
the opportunity to make history 
and to take away that burden by 
electing our next president Mrs. 
Clinton and next vice president 
Mr. Tim Kaine.”

During the primary season 

and previous elections, Clinton 
has had mixed success with 
younger 
voters, 
especially 

on college campuses like the 
University’s. During the 2008 
campaign, voters aged 18 to 
29 favored her opponent now-
President Barack Obama by a 
margin of 57 to 41 percent.

Eight 
years 
later 
in 
the 

2016 primaries, Sanders won 
Washtenaw County, 55.4 percent 
to Clinton’s 43.7 percent, taking 
Michigan overall in an upset win. 
He visited campus in March, 
as well as visiting Eastern 
Michigan University, and made 
a higher education policy — free 
college — one of the cornerstones 
of his campaign. After dropping 
out of the race, Sanders worked 
with Clinton to expand her 
higher education platform to 
encompass some of the ideas 
presented in Sanders’ such as 
offering free in-state tuition for 
families making under $125,000.

In 
his 
speech 
Tuesday, 

Kaine 
emphasized 
Michigan 

connections 
to 
Clinton’s 

plan, saying that 90 percent 
of Michigan families would 
be eligible for free in-state 
tuition if the proposed reforms 
are 
implemented. 
Currently, 

Michigan residents, like those 
in many other states, face 
significant loan debt burdens 
— overall, Michigan residents 
owe over $39 billion in federal 
student loans.

Kaine 
also 
focused 
on 

contrasts between Clinton’s and 
Republican presidential nominee 
Donald 
Trump’s 
visions 
on 

higher education policy. Noting 
that Trump has not yet released 
a specific platform on higher 
education 
reform, 
the 
vice 

presidential nominee suggested 
students refer instead to Trump’s 

background in higher education, 
citing Trump University — a 
educational program launched 
by 
Trump 
currently 
facing 

multiple lawsuits over charges 
that it defrauded students. 

“Who 
understands 
higher 

education? Who understands 
the power of an education?” 
Kaine said. “The choice is very, 
very clear: If you want a pro-
education president, it’s got to be 
Hillary Clinton.”

Kaine 
also 
emphasized 

contrasts between Clinton and 
Trump on other issues, charging 
that Trump encourages hateful 
speech and behavior. 

“If you cannot call out bigotry, 

if you cannot call out racism, 
xenophobia — if you can’t call 
it out and you stand back and 
you’re silent around it, you’re 
enabling it to grow,” he said. 
“You’re enabling it to become 
more powerful … so I’m happy 
to be on a ticket with someone 

who’s not afraid to call it out.”

He also touched on equity 

issues, 
calling 
the 
election 

a greater movement toward 
equality through “breaking the 
glass ceiling” and electing a 
female president.

Referencing the low numbers 

of 
women 
in 
Congress 
— 

currently they make up 19 
percent, which is the highest it 
has ever been —Kaine said it is 
time for the United States to step 

up to the plate.

“We are good at a lot of 

things,” he said. “But electing 
women to federal office is not 
one of them.”

Engineering freshman Evan 

Ciancio, 
who 
attended 
the 

rally, said that emphasis is what 
attracts him to the campaign.

“They’re supporting equality,” 

Ciancio said. “I see everyone at 
Michigan as equal, and I like 
how they also see that.”

Beyond 
appealing 
to 
the 

college 
setting 
through 
an 

emphasis on higher education, 
Kaine also kept his speech local 
by focusing on issues affecting 
the state of Michigan — such 
as the improvement of the auto 
industry — and the role the state 
has the potential to play in the 
election.

“Michigan is really really 

important. 
Both 
sides 
are 

competing 
very 
heavy 
in 

Michigan,” Kaine said. “We like 
what we see in Ann Arbor — I’d 
rather be us than them — but, it’s 
close.”

Currently, 
Clinton 
leads 

Trump 45.3 to 39.7 percent 
in 
Michigan, 
according 
to 

an 
average 
of 
polls 
from 

RealClearPolitics, 
though 

Trump and his campaign have 
expressed the goal of turning the 
state red several times. The state 
has not voted for a Republican 
presidential 
nominee 
since 

President Ronald Reagan.

 Kaine ended his remarks with 

that focus, encouraging students 
to be mindful of the role the state 
could play in the general election 
and volunteer for the campaign.

For 
many 
students 
who 

attended the event, the perceived 
importance of the 2016 election 
is already on their mind.

“It’s really important all the 

students are out showing that we 
actually do care about something 
like voting,” said LSA sophomore 
Natalie Burr, “because it is going 
to be really important in this 
state for Tim Kaine and Hillary 
Clinton to win the election.”

Not all agree with Kaine’s 

remarks, though. Sam Barke, a 
freshman at Hillsdale College in 
Hillsdale, traveled to Ann Arbor 
to protest Kaine’s Diag speech.

“I think that Hillary Clinton 

stands for more of the same of 
what’s been going on in this 
country in the eight years of 
failed Obama policies,” Barke 
said. “She’s corrupt.”

KAINE

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine 

(D-VA), the Democratic vice 
presidential nominee, might 
have been closer to the White 
House than he thought on 
Tuesday — across the street 
from the Diag, where students, 
faculty and staff gathered to 
hear Kaine talk about gender 
equality for female officials 
and the cost of tuition, a giant 
bounce-house version of the 
White House stood on North 
University Avenue for the day.

The inflatable was part 

of a station set up by the 
nonpartisan organization 
ONE to educate voters about 
extreme poverty across the 
country as part of its ONE Vote 
initiative.

Co-founded by U2 lead 

singer Bono, ONE “raise(s) 
public awareness and press(es) 
political leaders to combat 
AIDS and preventable diseases, 
increase investments in 
agriculture and nutrition and 
demand greater transparency 
in poverty-fighting programs,” 
according to their website.

The event featured a 

virtual reality simulator that 
allowed participants to watch 
and experience poverty in 
Africa through a short video 
as well as learn about what the 
organization is doing to help. 
Maggie Bridges, the ONE Vote 
campaign representative, said 

participants were then asked 
to sign a petition to both of the 
presidential nominees, former 
Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton and businessman 
Donald Trump, to encourage 
them to take measures toward 
ending extreme poverty in 
Africa upon entering the White 
House.

“We’re taking this 

all over the country; we 
launched it at the Republican 
National Convention and 
the Democratic National 
Convention and will be taking 
it all across the country until 
the end of the election,” 
Bridges said. “The point of 
it is to ask the presidential 
candidates to have a plan to 
fight extreme poverty when 
they enter the White House.”

After signing the petition, 

participants were encouraged 
to enjoy a few minutes in the 
White House-themed bounce 
house, Bridges added.

“The point of a giant bounce 

house is to give people an 
opportunity to cast their ballot 
and say what is important to 
them before they ‘enter the 
White House,’ ” she said.

The caravan is slated to 

continue traveling around to 
different college campuses in 
America, including Hofstra 
University in New York for the 
first presidential debate on 
Sept. 26.

Bridges said it was 

coincidental that the ONE 

caravan came to the University 
of Michigan on the same day as 
Kaine’s rally in the Diag, but it 
was a pleasant surprise.

“U of M was one of the 

spots we were working to 
come to for a while now and 
we found out yesterday or the 
day before that Tim Kaine was 
going to be here, so that was 
a pretty cool thing,” Bridges 
said. “We’d love for him to 
come by.”

Bridges said they had 

reached out to both campaigns 
asking for campaign 
representatives to stop by and 
meet with them.

Idealists for Hillary activist 

Jeffrey Stacey, an LSA class of 
1991 alum, stopped by the ONE 
Vote event to make connections 
with the initiative. Stacey said 
he works closely with Clinton’s 
campaign and is currently 
working to educate young 
progressives who formerly 
supported Sen. Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT) or the Green Party 
about Clinton’s agenda.

Stacey is a Democrat, but 

says he admires the universal, 
nonpartisan goals that ONE 
strives for.

“You see it right there; 

fighting extreme poverty, 
that is something we are in 
lockstep with them on,” Stacey 
said. “They’re so committed to 
getting people to act on their 
political opinions that they’re 
nonpartisan — they’re a great 
organization.”

Inflatable bounce house on North University 
aims to educate voters about poverty issues

sleep, self-rated health — but 
they live longer,” said Shervin 
Assari, the School of Public 
Health psychiatric research 
investigator who conducted 
the study. “So there is a 
paradox that they say ‘I’m not 
as good’ but they live longer.”

Men naturally perceive 

risk differently than women 
with regard to health issues, 
Assari said.

“The brain is designed in 

a way to protect men from 
perception of risk,” Assari 
said.

Assari attributed much 

of his findings not only to 
evolutionary tendencies but 
also to personality differences 
between men and women — 
something that similar studies 
in Europe and Canada have 
revealed as well.

“Being a woman is 

associated with awareness of 
symptoms, awareness of their 
body and also perception of 
risk,” Assari said. “Regardless 
of the domain of risk, if it 
is nuclear bombing, if it is a 
new political change or if it 
is a reactor in their city or 

anything, women perceive the 
same risk as higher.”

Psychology Prof. Robin 

Edelstein, who was not 
involved in the study but 
investigates individual 
personality differences 
related to hormones, said she 
would support the findings 
of the study, noting that 
women are generally more 
conscientious, which could 
lead to them seeking out 
medical care more often. 
Women also tend to be higher 
in neuroticism, which could 
correlate to them worrying 
about other factors in addition 
to their health.

“Men are probably 

underreporting symptoms for 
self-presentation reasons,” 
Edelstein said. “For men 
there’s this idea that they 
want to report they are 
healthier than they really 
are.”

Edelstein added that 

she doesn’t believe these 
differences are reflected in 
structures of the brain.

“I would say it’s probably 

about how men and women 
are socialized,” Edelstein said. 
“Men are probably socialized 
to not complain about their 
health and to be tough and 

masculine.”

Ultimately, Assari said 

his research serves multiple 
purposes. First, when 
patients report poor health, 
it is proven to likely predict 
mortality, so their concerns 
should be taken into account. 
Additionally, research that 
considers self-rated health as 
a screening tool for eligibility 
for certain services should 
be aware of the predictor’s 
health implications as well.

He also cited the 

significance of this data 
in the world of precision 
medicine — a customized 
approach to treating illnesses 
and developing individual 
treatment plans based on 
understanding a patient’s full 
medical history and physical 
state.

“There is a new increasing 

interest about precision 
medicine that indicators of 
health should be differently 
used for differing individuals, 
and treatments should 
be tailored based on that 
person,” Assari said. “These 
types of works can contribute 
to precision medicine because 
they say, if you are a member 
of this group here, men, that 
single item is more serious.”

financial aid than most other 
Midwestern states, spending 
just an average of $223 per 
undergraduate 
full-time 

equivalent student. The state 
also only spends 42 percent 
of the national average on 
financial aid grants per full-
time student.

When it comes to the other 

side of the equation — tuition 
— the University announced 
a 3.9 percent tuition increase 
for 
in-state 
undergraduate 

students this summer, which 
corresponds to an increase of 
$546 per year. This is similar to 
increases in past years.

In response to the report, 

University of Michigan Provost 
Martha Pollack emphasized 
the 
University’s 
pledge 
to 

meet the financial needs of 
in-state students. She cited 
the University’s commitment 
to providing better services to 
students as an explanation for 
rising costs.

“If people want a world-class 

faculty, you have to pay for 
world-class faculty,” Pollack 
said.

She also pointed to inflation 

costs and raising funds for 
financial aid, as well as as the 
commitment to providing an 
improved education, as the 
three main reasons for tuition 
increase. However, she also 
stressed the difference between 
the sticker price of tuition and 
the amount actually paid by 

students, saying the number 
is not an accurate indication 
of affordability because of the 
amount of aid provided.

Overall, about 70 percent of 

in-state students receive some 
kind of financial aid, according 
to Pollack. This year’s proposed 
increase in tuition includes a 
10.8 percent increase in need-
based grant aid — as of this 
year, the University has gone 
seven years with no increase 
in full-cost attendance for 
in-state 
students 
in 
need, 

Pollack said.

The 
High 
Achieving 

Involved Leader scholarship, 
a 
need-based 
scholarship 

program 
launched 
by 
the 

University last year, is one of 
the new programs that will 
be funded by the increase in 
tuition. The program provides 
a select group of low income, 
in-state students with four 
years free of tuition. 

Beyond individual choices to 

raise tuition at universities and 
stagnant financial aid from the 
state and federal government, 
state funding to universities 
also plays a large role in 
determining college costs and 
subsequent loan burdens for 
Michigan students.

In 2011, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 

announced a 15-percent cost 
cut of in-state public university 
funding 
across 
the 
board, 

cutting funding specifically to 
UM by 21.6 percent. The most 
recent $16 billion education 
budget, for 2017, allows for a 
2.9-percent increase in funding 
to public in-state universities 

but doesn’t quite return to the 
pre-2011 levels.

Peter Ruark, a senior policy 

analyst at the Michigan League 
of Public Policy, said the 
decrease in state funding may 
be a “slow privatization” of 
Michigan’s public university 
system.

“It’s 
a 
big 
mistake 
to 

disinvest in education,” Ruark 
said.

CSG Vice President Micah 

Griggs, an LSA senior, said the 
constant increase in tuition 
taints the struggling student’s 
college experience.

“Students at the University 

of Michigan and nationwide 
are graduating college with 
more and more student loan 
debt and it does have an effect 
on our college experience,” 
Griggs said. “Decisions such 
as what classes to take, what 
student organizations to join 
and how to support yourself 
financially while on campus is 
becoming harder.”

Pollack also charged that 

most coverage of rising costs 
hasn’t 
acknowledged 
that 

the University is below the 
national average annual tuition 
cost, and that UM graduates 
are above the national average 
in earnings post-graduation.

“These newspaper stories 

are fixated on the sticker price, 
and our strategy is to try and 
have people pay a lot less if 
their families have less money,” 
Pollack said. “What you need to 
look at is what people actually 
pay.”

The politics of diagnosis

W

ith Pavlovian rhythm, 
my phone buzzed and 
I 
diverted 
attention 

from my Sunday 
homework 
routine 
to 

check the CNN 
notification that 
flashed 
across 

my 
screen. 
It 

read: 
“Hillary 

Clinton 
was 

diagnosed with 
pneumonia 
on Friday, her 
doctor says. The 
doctor revealed 
the condition hours after Clinton 
stumbled while leaving a 9/11 
event.” So, like any political junkie 
worth his salt, I minimized Canvas 
and put Google to work on the 
handful of questions I now had. If 
she was diagnosed on Friday, why 
are we finding out two days later? 
What exactly does stumbling look 
like? How serious is this?

As someone whose knowledge 

of medicine begins and ends with 
episodes of “Scrubs,” I was hoping 
for a straightforward response. It 
seemed to me that there would be 
little room for interpretation with 
something as straightforward as 
pneumonia — either the incident was 
cause for concern from a medical 
standpoint or it was not. But, as with 
any news story that drifts within 
the orbit of Trump Tower or the 
so-called Clinton World, facts are 
secondary to spin. My eye naturally 
combed through the feed, I learned 
the facts of the story and I returned 
to my homework.

Here are the facts of the story 

that I learned: The Democratic 
frontrunner 
for 
president 
has 

been campaigning through illness 
for several days now and became 
overheated while toughing it out 
through a 9/11 commemoration 
service. As Bloomberg Politics 
correspondent 
Jennifer 
Epstein 

tweeted on the day she was 
diagnosed, 
“...She 
appeared 
at 

2 fundraisers, ran a 2-hour natl 
security mtg, sat for CNN intvu.” 
What a champion! Hours later, 
I saw a video of her walking out 
of daughter Chelsea’s New York 

apartment, smiling and claiming 
to be “feeling great.” I saw the 
statistic that more than 1.1 million 
Americans 
are 
admitted 
to 

hospitals for pneumonia every year. 
Things were more or less the same 
as I expected. And I moved on.

Here are the facts of the story I 

could have learned if I had different 
political leanings: After two days 
of covering up a serious illness, 
Hillary Clinton fainted and had 
to be dragged into a waiting van. 
While her campaign is claiming 
that the cause is pneumonia (which 
can be fatal in its own right), 
doctors are questioning whether 
this incident, and the cough she 
has tried to hide for weeks, may 
be representative of something 
more serious, like Parkinson’s. At 
68 years old, she clearly lacks the 
stamina to assume the office of 
the president. If I hated Hillary 
Clinton, things were more or less 
the same as I would have expected. 
And I would have moved on.

For better or worse, the health 

of our presidential candidates has 
become an important issue during 
this campaign. Rather than seeking 
impartial diagnosis, however, or 
getting second opinions as one 
would for themselves or a loved 
one, the American voter in 2016 
seeks whatever bill of health makes 
them comfortable — whether that 
be the absurd and over-the-top 
letter from Trump’s doctor Harold 
Bornstein claiming that his patient 
would be “the healthiest individual 
ever elected to the presidency,” 
or the note from Clinton’s doctor 
Lisa Bardack, who brushed off the 
episode as caused by dehydration 
and assured the Democratic faithful 
that their champion was “recovering 
nicely.” Alternatively, the voter 
could tumble down the wormhole 
of internet diagnoses, into the world 
where the difference between the 
common cold and typhoid is just 
three clicks. Or, as was seen with 
this most recent incident, there 
can be diagnosis by committee, 
constituted 
of 
nonmedical 

professionals posting on Twitter 
or Facebook what their thoroughly 
(un)informed opinion may be. At 
no point was the consideration 

made that the health of both major 
party presidential candidates could 
be reported objectively, without 
partisanship or agenda.

Of 
course, 
presidential 

candidates are human, and an 
exam in September by no means 
guarantees a clean bill of health 
for the next four years. And, in 
retrospect, 
many 
Americans 

have learned just how human 
presidents can be — from John 
F. Kennedy’s Addison’s disease 
to 
Woodrow 
Wilson’s 
stroke, 

from Abraham Lincoln’s battle 
with depression and the state of 
Ronald Reagan’s mental faculties 
toward the end of his second 
term. Learning about these after 
the fact — only once these people 
are already out of office — the 
American people turned a blind 
eye, refusing to allow the disease 
to stain the legacy of the man. 
But would JFK have been elected 
if Americans had seen his weight 
loss and frailty, when he was 
feverish and struggling to get 
through a day on the campaign 
trail? Absolutely not; presidential 
candidates should show vigor, 
stamina, strength and energy.

Unfortunately, 
the 
odds 
of 

finding a candidate that fits the bill 
this year are slim. On election day, 
the major party candidates will 
have a combined age of 139. One is 
currently battling a lung infection 
and the other has a reputation of 
eating too much fast food while 
operating on an irregular sleep 
schedule. Neither is the spitting 
image of health. So if the American 
people have decided that the 
physical health of the president is 
an issue in this campaign, fine. But 
let it be an issue like tax returns 
or reports of donations to the 
Federal Election Commission — 
concrete, factual and indisputable. 
Otherwise, the reports out of 
each camp from personal doctors 
should be recognized to be just as 
partisan, biased and predisposed 
as 
statements 
from 
campaign 

surrogates in the spin room after 
a debate.

Incarceration won’t stop assault

I 

was 7 years old when I had my first attack. 
The accusations swarmed my head: “Stop 
pretending,” “you just want attention,” 

“you’re being over dramatic.” I head for my 
school’s office. My back hurts more than any 
pain I have ever experienced. My eyes are 
flooding, but I break through the tears and 
manage to ask to call home. My mom’s panic 
beamed through the phone. “Just try to relax, 
hold it in if you can.” My dad drives past 
our home and pulls the car up to the Detroit 
Medical Center’s emergency drop-off zone. 
There they got the nurses to assess my pain. 
“Can you rank your pain from one to 10? One is 
OK and 10 is bad.” “It’s an 11!” As if ambivalent 
to my response, they place an I.V. in me and take 
some blood from me. Then I was stuck waiting 
for the results.

Three hours later … The doctors brought 

proof of the pain they now believed I had 
because they saw it in my blood tests. “She has 
sickle cell anemia. Her hemoglobin is lower 
than average, and her white blood cell count is 
high. It’s a chronic disorder,” again acting as if I 
were not there. I feel I am no longer a 7-year-old 
girl but rather an object— like a computer my 
parents brought in for repair, only to find out I 
was permanently damaged. Then I am trapped.

So I walk around the hospital with the 

I.V. in my arm and push the machine that is 
connected to it. Several doctors consult with 
me. A psychologist interviews me to make sure 
I am “handling my chronic illness.” A physical 
therapist helps me move around after my pain 
becomes “manageable.” A physician checks in 
on me periodically and asks how my pain is. 
There are also several nurses on rotation. They 
come in, write their names for me, sometimes 
give me more medicine, but always move on 
to the next patient. It all feels like an assembly 
line. I am just another part in line for a repair 
that is only going to fix me temporarily.

After the doctors do all they can to make my 

pain “manageable,” I am finally released. Yet 
the sickle cell attacks come back sporadically. 
One minute I feel fine and the next I scream 
with pain. “Be strong,” my parents say, “so we 
don’t have to take you back to the hospital.” I 
tried with all my might to “hold it in” and avoid 
confinement. But the pain is stronger than I am. 
There is a red, angry wave pulsing through my 
body. It forces itself through the channels meant 
only for my blood without care or hesitation. It 
is a bully. It pushes itself through my veins, and 
wherever it passes, the pain follows.

The house shakes with my pain. It tears my 

family apart and wreaks havoc wherever I am. 
It is not biased. It does not discriminate. It does 
not care that I am “just a little Muslim girl from 
Nigeria,” as my parents would say. It does not 
care if I am well-mannered or if I misbehave. It 
does not care if I am at school, a friend’s house 
or at home. It frightens my parents and fills 
them with worry. Yet, no one can understand 
how I feel. They want me to stop expressing my 
pain. But I cannot stop. It is a force out of my 
control. I try to explain to them but I have lost 
my biggest means of communication.

I open my mouth to attempt to form words 

but the pain chokes them. My larynx is gone 
and in its place is a broken tape recorder. “My 

dearest daughter, please stop screaming, the 
neighbors will hear you and think something 
bad is happening.” I wonder why expressing 
my pain is such a “bad” thing. At school, I was 
given the chance to express myself through art. 
So I took a piece of cardboard and used a black 
sharpie to highlight its imperfections. My art 
teacher looked at it with confusion but did not 
question my creation. I looked at it with awe. I 
felt that I had just created something beautiful 
out of the cardboard’s pain and hoped I could 
do the same with my own.

I struggle to feel good when I am in pain, 

however. I try to cry and kick the pain out of 
me, but those actions do nothing. My parents 
tell me to “just pray,” and that “Allah does not 
give someone what they cannot handle.” But I 
feel that God has forsaken me; that my pain was 
His way of punishing me; that for some reason 
unknown to me, God was upset with me. I find 
it hard to pray in so much pain. Even when I did 
pray, the pain came back. Even while praying, 
the pain persisted. Even after praying, the pain 
did not disappear.

However, I managed to stay out of the hospital 

for a while; seven years, to be exact. But I was 
not pain free. I just stayed at home. I sometimes 
missed school because the pain was too much. 
My mom did her best to soothe me, but there was 
only so much she could do. I had to learn how to 
manage my pain. Over the years, it became more 
tolerable. I realized what I would have called an 
11 back when I was 7 years old was now an eight. I 
got better at suppressing my pain and muting my 
screams. No one knew I had a “chronic disorder” 
unless I told them. I only conveyed that fact when 
I was in pain. 

I was 14 years old the second time I was 

admitted to the hospital. I was doing so well in 
school. It was nearing the end of my freshmen 
year, and so far I had straight A’s. I suppose the 
stress of finals was getting to me. The doctors 
told me stress could cause “sickle cell attacks.” 
Well I guess my back really felt the stress. While 
in the hospital, I was restless. I could not help but 
feel surrounded and restricted by the machines. I 
wanted nothing more than to be released as soon 
as possible so I could return to school. I thought 
it was normal to desire to be back in school, so I 
was surprised to find out that the girl in the next 
room was begging to stay in the hospital. I could 
not imagine why she did not want to go back to 
school. My nurse told me I was special and that 
most of the other sickle cell patients prefer to stay 
in the hospital than return to school. No one had 
ever referred to my pain as special. Until then I 
thought I was the only one who had to deal with 
such pain. I felt fortunate to be so motivated in 
school and thought that maybe God had not 
forsaken me after all. I became proud of my pain 
and my ability to not let it define who I am, even 
though the pain still came back.

P

eople seem to think we can 
fix rape culture and sexual 
assault by putting rapists 

in prison for a 
long time. Take 
for 
example 

the 
response 

to 
the 
Brock 

Turner 
case: 

people 
yelling 

for him to be imprisoned for way 
longer, people outraged at his early 
release, a mobilization to recall the 
judge who sentenced him to six 
months, as well as the passage of a 
mandatory minimum sentence law 
for specific types of sexual assault 
by the California legislature.

This reaction is understandable; 

people aren’t wrong for wanting 
rapists to go to prison since we’ve 
been given no avenue other than 
incarceration 
as 
a 
suggestion 

for how we might resolve the 
harms done to individuals and 
to communities through sexual 
assault and rape. But to me, there 
seems to be something faulty 
with this line of thinking which 
assumes that we can fix something 
as dehumanizing, violating and 
oppressive as sexual assault with 
something 
as 
dehumanizing, 

violating and oppressive as prison.

If Brock Turner, or anyone for 

that matter, rapes someone again, 
which likely will be the case given 
the rate of serial rapists, it won’t 
be because we didn’t lock him up 
for long enough. It’ll be because 
of his unaddressed sexism, sexual 
entitlement and toxic masculinity 
(among 
other 
problematic 

behavioral traits); it’ll be because 
he was never truly rehabilitated; 
and it’ll be because, I think, the 
structure of our criminal justice 
system 
is 
incompatible 
with 

achieving real justice for sexual 
assault victims and survivors.

In order to prevent rape, you 

need to know why it happens, and 
it doesn’t happen because we’re not 
sending people to prison for 14 years. 
It happens because our society is 
full of patriarchy and sexism and 
problematic power relationships. 
The prison environment reinforces 
and 
amplifies 
harmful 
power 

dynamics 
that 
feminists 
and 

anti-rape advocates are trying to 
eradicate. Prison is not the place 
to 
rehabilitate 
rapists 
because 

it 
replicates 
the 
dynamics, 

hierarchies and aggressive hyper-
masculine culture that are all at 

least partially responsible for the 
normalization, 
acceptance 
and 

proliferation of sexual assault.

In addition to the issue of using 

an oppressive environment to 
correct an oppressive behavior, our 
justice system also seems to be ill 
set up to prosecute sexual assault 
cases and ultimately incapable 
of really achieving justice for 
survivors and victims of sexual 
assault. Often, the reason people 
report their assault is because 
they want their assailant to take 
responsibility for the harm they 
inflicted. In other words — and 
this is very basic — many survivors 
and victims want their rapists to 
acknowledge and recognize the 
pain they inflicted: they want an 
apology. Take the viral victim 
impact statement from the Brock 
Turner case, where she writes: “I 
also told the probation officer that 
what I truly wanted was for Brock 
to get it, to understand and admit 
to his wrongdoing.”

Our system is not set up for 

this. It actively disincentives any 
admission of responsibility, what 
it calls being ‘guilty,’ through 
its threat of severe punishment, 
i.e. prison. People charged with 
felonies 
are 
understandably 

afraid to admit guilt because 
that likely would mean going to 
prison. Because our system is 
punitive instead of restorative, it 
incentivizes selfishness and self-
preservation 
over 
compassion, 

dialogue and true resolution.

Also, 
the 
established 
way 

guilt is decided in the courts 
is through the jurors. Socially, 
we’re to understand jurors as 
people 
who 
provide 
outside, 

objective 
evaluations 
of 
the 

evidence in order to arrive at a 
fair assessment of the defendant’s 
guilt or innocence. But it’s mostly 
impossible for jurors to do this 
because 1. There’s hardly ever 
any concrete evidence for jurors 
to review in rape cases and 2. 
Jurors exist in the same world we 
do, and by that I mean jurors are 
ensconced in all the same rape-
culture bullshit the rest of us are 
and are thus likely to be swayed by 
sexist tropes and victim-blaming 
myths in the deliberation process.

What ought to be the guiding 

principle of handling sexual assault 
and rape cases is that a person — the 
survivor/victim — feels like they 
were violated and so they were. We 

must accept this truth and create 
alternative models of restorative 
justice to rectify this harm. This 
means the creation of survivor/
victim-centered spaces for resolving 
rape and sexual assault, spaces that 
are radically divergent from the 
current ones we have, whether that 
be the college sexual-assault panel 
or the official court room trial. In 
these spaces the question isn’t if 
this person was violated, but rather 
accepting that this person was 
violated and that we as a community 
need to do something about it with 
the survivor/victim as the leader of 
the process.

This 
might 
seem 
really 

outrageous and unachievable, but 
we already do accept and practice 
this principle in other aspects of 
our lives. There’s an episode of 
Louie that talks about it: Louie 
tells his friend that he, the friend, 
Lenny, hurt him when he hit him. 
Lenny says he didn’t hurt him, and 
then Louie says “I’m telling you 
that it hurt and you don’t get to 
deny that. When a person tells you 
that you hurt them you don’t get to 
decide that you didn’t.”

In this process of resolving 

sexual assault and rape not the 
perpetrator, nor anyone else, gets 
to decide against or argue about 
the survivor/victim’s account of 
the assault. They don’t get to decide 
that they didn’t assault them. The 
perpetrator’s opinion and anyone 
else’s opinion of the perpetrators 
guilt/innocence is irrelevant. The 
only account of what happened that 
can hold any weight is that of the 
person who was assaulted.

Collectively, we’re responsible 

for cultivating an environment 
where the survivor/victim is able 
to heal, where the perpetrator 
recognizes what harm they caused 
and is required and desires to do 
something to resolve the harm. 
This 
represents 
a 
major 
and 

necessary 
departure 
from 
our 

established principles of justice 
by removing the threat of severe 
punishment (i.e. prison). We deter 
the rampant selfishness and self-
preservation that exists in our 
current justice system through 
this paradigm shift — by moving 
towards a model that prioritizes 
honesty, healing, compassion and 
humane reparations.

Despite flaws, ‘Jane’ 
brings laughs to MTV

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

It sparks little surprise that 

MTV’s 
newest 
weed-infused 

comedy series is by executive pro-
ducer 
Snoop 

Dogg. “Mary + 
Jane” revolves 
around 
the 

concepts 
embodied 
by 

both the rap-
per 
and 
the 

front of MTV 
alike, “Mary + 
Jane” running 
on 
a 
“main-

streamed” focus and relying on 
millennials to identify with the 
life that the series’ protagonists 
live on a daily basis. The only 
problem with this concept is 
that, as a viewer, the line tends to 
become blurred between genuine 
and satirical humor. It’s almost 
impossible to tell the difference 
between serious points of parody 
and humorously placed ideas. 
Though one character’s t-shirt 
reading “Some band you’ve never 
heard of” accurately satirizes the 
hipster movement, an L.A. restau-
rant that only serves dry toast à 
la carte for $15 feels overbearing 
and doesn’t blend well into the 
grand scheme of the show. It is 
pretty funny, though.

The premise of the show is sim-

ple. Roommates and best friends 
Paige (Jessica Rothe, “Next Time 

on Lonny”) and Jordan (Scout 
Durwood, “The List”) are on 
a mission to top the marijuana 
industry of East L.A., aiming at 
reaching drug-dealer stardom as 
one of the top 15 dealers of the 
region. To do so, they cater to cli-
ents via their weed business, con-
veniently titled “Mary + Jane,” 
which is slowly drawing more 
attention from celebrity icons 
and competition alike. At the very 
least, the series shows promise 
in setting long-term goals and an 
active running plot to keep the 
show interesting over mindless 
gigs. However, it’s unfortunate 
that high-reaching goals are the 
only things that seem to matter 
in the series besides Paige and 
Jordan 
themselves. 
Although 

romantic interests are few and far 
between — for Paige at least, as 
Jordan is constantly ravaged by 
lust — the romantics that ensue 
are far from intimate in the series. 
Besides the leading ladies, nobody 
else seems to matter, given their 
small and fleeting roles in the 
pilot. In any other case, this would 
seem refreshing and agreeable to 
the series’s intent of skimming the 
norms of society. But in “Mary + 
Jane,” it stands out more as a flaw 
in character development than 
a cry against the mainstream. 
If the writers wish to introduce 
substantial supporting charac-
ters other than Paige and Jordan, 
they should really consider doing 
so now, before the series lives too 

much up to its name.

Despite the many flaws that 

plague this drug-induced sit-
com (one has to wonder how 
that table read went...), there are 
redeemable qualities to be found 
in “Mary + Jane.” The greatest 
example appears as a long-run-
ning joke — that Jordan’s “Legally 
Blonde”-esque chihuahua is inti-
mately interested in Paige. The 
puppy’s insatiable lust is humor-
ously expressed throughout the 
show by stints that involve not-
so-edible underwear and sexual 
subtitles that stand out brazenly 
to viewers. Another talking point 
comes from a covert ops celeb-
rity delivery involving high-tech 
security and the probable forced 
slavery of performers to spoiled 
children. After taking too much of 
her own product, Jordan delivers 
the not-so-prescription weed to 
the couple, who are unidentified 
in her drug-induced haze, and 
perceived as a skeleton and a raw 
chicken. However, despite these 
strange and silly antics, the lack 
of close interpersonal relation-
ships in the series paints a picture 
of detachment, and not in a way 
that’s in best interests of the show. 
Perhaps it’s because the series 
runs on a time limit of twenty-odd 
minutes as a sitcom, but if Jordan 
and Paige don’t begin making 
friends soon, then “Mary + Jane” 
might not make it past the whole 
casual, 
scroll-through 
watch 

phase.

ALBUM REVIEW

By SEAN LANG

For the Daily

On their third studio album 

(and first for Warner Bros. 
Records), Seattle-based indie rock 
band The Head 
and the Heart 
continue 
to 

deliver reliably 
catchy, 
sing-

able melodies. 
Though clearly 
a creation of 
the same band 
that gave us 
2011’s The Head 
and the Heart 
and 
2013’s 

Let’s Be Still, Signs of Light takes 
more cues from pop rock than the 
garage-band brand of indie Amer-
icana that defined their debut. 
More often, electric guitar — a 
new introduction to TH&TH’s 
instrumentation — takes the lead 
rather than the violin (or any 
other instrument, for that mat-
ter, aside from frontman Jona-
than Russell’s voice). Whether 
it’s directly a result of the electric 
guitar or more representative of 
a shift in songwriting mentality, 
the band presents a more filled-
out sound here than on previous 
albums, growing in tandem with 
their audience.

Signs of Light opens with 

crowd-rising anthem “All We 
Ever Knew,” probably the most 
successful song as well as the rare 
track in which the violin takes 
a prominent role in carving out 
the melody. The chorus — for the 
most part, a catchy but meaning-
less “la la la” — opens with the 

line “All we ever do is all we ever 
knew.” While in the context of the 
song, this references the cyclical 
or recurrent nature of relation-
ship woes, it also seems well-
suited as an introduction to the 
album as a whole. It’s pleasant to 
listen to, with some sonic tweaks, 
but thematically, The Head and 
the Heart are rehashing familiar 
territory.

Most songs deal with an ambig-

uous sort of love or loss (or some-
times both), hinging largely on 
clichés — particularly ironic given 
the lyric, “ ’Cause I’m looking for 
the truth / Not some tired cheap 
cliché,” in “False Alarm.” Day-
to-day mundanity, nostalgia and 
wounds healed only by the pass-
ing of time are all common themes 
throughout the album. TH&TH 
also appear to have found a more-
than-casual interest in dreams 
and sleep, with lyrics referring 
to one or both appearing in seven 
of the 13 songs on the album, and 
even one song titled “Dreamer.” 
It’s difficult to decipher what 
exactly inspired this theme, or 
whether it was an intentional or 
a subconscious inclusion. Perhaps 
it’s in some way tied to the band’s 
lengthy separation between Let’s 
Be Still and this release, or per-
haps it’s, even better, just coin-
cidence. In any event, food for 
thought.

While Signs of Light boasts a 

greater range of instrumentation 
than all of their previous material, 
as well as a more confident (and 
rightly so) falsetto out of Russell, 
there is a striking lack of Charity 
Rose Thielen’s voice. Though she 
does back a range of tracks, her 

only solo verse comes in the mid-
dle of “Colors.” Whatever the rea-
son for her lack of vocal feature 
on the album, the absence of her 
effervescent, delicately wavering 
voice leaves a noticeable void.

Trading much of their indie 

charm in exchange for wider 
appeal, the sound of Signs of Light 
is a surprisingly accurate reflec-
tion of TH&TH’s move to Warner 
Bros. Records. For the vast major-
ity of longtime fans, this album is 
sure to delight, but many will also 
lament the days when “Rivers and 
Roads” was a thorough represen-
tation of the band’s sound. There 
are valuable moments here, to be 
sure; “All We Ever Knew” is a clin-
ic on earworm melodies (sporting 
about four distinct tunes itself), 
and the back-to-back “Oh My 
Dear” and “I Don’t Mind” present 
some of the strongest songwriting 
on the album and provide some of 
the only moments where it sounds 
like the band is actually challeng-
ing themselves sonically.

It’s not that there’s anything 

wrong with the album, per se, 
there’s just nothing new or par-
ticularly compelling about it. It 
seems that the only factor differ-
entiating TH&TH from other alt-
indie-pop-rock-folk bands, at this 
point, is Russell’s and Thielen’s 
voices. Ultimately, Signs of Light 
makes for a thoroughly pleasant 
listening experience. Unfortu-
nately, even after multiple lis-
tens, the album fails to reveal any 
meaning deeper than what is indi-
cated on the surface, and there 
aren’t many truly innovative, 
exciting moments, with fewer still 
challenging ones.

ALBUM REVIEW

New DeGraw album 
is not ‘Worth Saving’

RCA RECORDS

Just like your fedora-slingin’ boy next door.

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The other night I malicious-

ly subjected my roommates to 
Gavin DeGraw’s latest album, 
Something 
Worth Saving.

Don’t 
get 

me wrong — I 
love Gavin, I 
could listen to 
One Tree Hill’s 
theme song, “I 
Don’t Want To 
Be,” on a loop 
for the rest of 
my life and I 
would 
prob-

ably belt the chorus every time. 
However, Something Worth Sav-
ing is somewhat of a departure 
from OG Gavin. This Gavin is 
more upbeat, less angsty and a lot 
more bubbly.

When the first track started 

rolling, I thought Adam Levine 

was serenading me with another 
one of Maroon 5’s corny pop bal-
lads. But that annoyingly happy 
and upbeat sound pouring out of 
the speakers was none other than 
Gavin DeGraw making the best 
out of a bad situation.

For those of you who know of 

Gavin DeGraw, good for you. But 
I would be willing to bet that a lot 
of people don’t know of him or, 
at the very least, couldn’t name a 
song other than “I Don’t Want To 
Be.” So in an attempt to remain 
somewhat relevant, Gavin put 
out the ten-track, juvenile Some-
thing Worth Saving.

It’s not that the album is hor-

rendously, 
unbearably 
awful, 

it’s just an immature effort for a 
seemingly experienced musician 
whose last album came out three 
years ago.

Despite the album’s overall 

mediocracy, there were some 
tiny peaks — albeit, only notice-
able with the aid of a magnifying 

glass — throughout, such as “Kite 
Like Girl.”

“Kite Like Girl” is actually 

quite catchy and I jammed to it 
like a little girl. With an upbeat 
tempo and a peppy Maroon 5 
meets John Mayer chorus, it’s by 
far the most stylistically distinct 
track on the album.

Another 
peak 
would 
be 

“Something Worth Saving,” for 
the sole reason that it actually 
made me realize that I’m sin-
gle. It’s sad, melodic and maybe 
even a little bit beautiful. The 
Ron Pope-esque, “I’m-weaping-
over-my-guitar” sound carries 
throughout, making “Something 
Worth Saving” the ideal song to 
eat an entire pint of Halo Top 240 
cal. ice cream to (I know, God 
really does exist). 

These two songs, though, are 

it. The remaining eight tracks 
are unremarkable — not bad, not 
great, just unremarkable. But 
then again, that’s Gavin DeGraw.

ALBUM REVIEW

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Daveed Diggs’s experimental 

rap group, clipping., just dropped 
its second studio album. Splendor 
& Misery only 
holds true to the 
second half of 
its name. Sure, 
one 
can 
find 

enjoyment 
in 

Diggs’s erratic, 
skipping 
flow, 

but the produc-
tion makes the 
album 
sink. 

For the most part, it sounds like 
someone recorded a maintenance 
crew on a spaceship, and then said, 
“This sounds awful, but whatever. 
We’re doing it.”

clipping. began in Los Ange-

les in 2009. The group consists of 
the aforementioned Diggs as its 
vocalist, with William Hutson and 
Jonathan Snipes providing pro-
duction. Their first album, Midc-
ity, was released in 2013 on the 
group’s website. Shortly after that, 
they were signed to the record 
label Sub Pop and proceeded to 
release CLPPNG in 2014.

Their latest album, the first since 

Diggs found fame through his role 
in the musical “Hamilton,” feels 
out of reach. Perhaps it’s because 
of the outlandish and extrater-
restrial production. Maybe it’s 
because the album’s plot, which 
“follows the sole survivor of a 
slave uprising on an interstellar 

cargo ship, and the onboard com-
puter that falls in love with him.” 
Maybe it’s because of lines like 
“flesh is hanging in sun” on the 
track “True Believer.” Maybe it’s 
because of Diggs himself, who 
dances and glides over the beat 
at such a breakneck pace that the 
listener has little time to absorb 
his message. At certain points in 
the album, Diggs switches his 
flow up, choosing to go on robot-
ic diatribes instead. This change 
in pace is evident on the album’s 
final track, “A Better Place,” 
which is also the album’s most 
optimistic piece.

Daveed Diggs can say a whole 

bunch of words in a very small 
amount of time and still sound 
cool. At the risk of gross over-
simplification, this is his skill. He 
captivated audiences through-
out his dual performances as 
Thomas Jefferson and Marquis 
de Lafayette in “Hamilton.” His 
rhymes seem to barely touch the 
air, like bubbles in a fresh glass of 
champagne. The charisma of his 
persona has also pushed Diggs 
into the spotlight. His muscular 
build, wild hair and garish fash-
ion choices all contribute to the 
growing fame of the actor/rapper. 
Since he is primarily known for 
his Tony-winning performance 
in “Hamilton,” those who listen 
to Splendor & Misery are in for a 
rude awakening.

Throughout Splendor & Mis-

ery, the essence of Diggs’s lyrical 
style remains, but the abrasive 

instrumentals make the listen-
ing experience a strenuous one. 
The struggle is apparent from the 
first track of the album, “Long 
Way Away (Intro).” One is greet-
ed to the sound of overwhelming 
vibration, the same vibration that 
comes from your roommate’s sub-
woofer at 2 a.m. as you try to sleep 
or from a rocket ship. It’s tough to 
tell at 2 a.m.

It’s an annoying song, but it’s 

not intolerable as a short open-
ing track. The second track, 
“The Breach,” begins with Diggs 
rapping as a computer aboard a 
spaceship, describing a human 
that has been found in one of 
the cabins. It’s an undoubtedly 
interesting introduction, which 
shows off the rapper’s tremen-
dous lyrical versatility. It’s also 
an 
undoubtedly 
unpleasant 

beginning that ends with the 
reverberations of broken glass, 
gunfire and radio static. These 
harsh vibrations provide a strong 
foreshadowing for the rest of the 
album.

There are some albums out 

there that aren’t exactly fun, 
but they’re important and thus 
require listening: for instance, 
Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a But-
terfly. The album’s cocktail of 
jazz-fusion and hip hop contrib-
utes to a incredibly celebrated 
and sophisticated work, but it 
isn’t fun. Neither is Splendor 
& Misery, but it also lacks the 
cultural value to be considered 
important.

W

e live in an age 
where 
originality 

is gradually dying 

out. From superhero blockbuster 
movies to Top 40 pop music to 
network sitcoms, almost every 
medium relies on a formula and 
it’s becoming more apparent every 
day. Though certain works have 
tweaked their respective formulas 
in new and exciting ways, there 
are some that can’t help but be 
processed and standardized into 
the same product with a subtly 
different appeal. What’s even 
more appalling is how people 
who use these formulas are able 
to accrue social currency and 
monetary value by simply copying 
off of more talented and lesser-
known artists.

This pattern of copycatting 

other 
people 
is 
especially 

evident on social media outlets 
like Instagram, where popular

blog (@pizza, 455k followers), and 
a fashion meme Instagram (@
beigecardigan, 2.5m followers).

Both of their successes are 

definitely admirable, considering 
how they know exactly how to 
market 
themselves. 
However, 

that doesn’t excuse the fact that 
both 
@TheFatJewish 
and 
@

fuckjerry make careers out of 
stealing 
intellectual 
property 

from other people for the sake of 
entertaining avid Instagram users 
and subsequently grossing lots 
of money. @TheFatJewish has 
especially attracted controversy 
from other artists and comedians 
for stealing jokes and ideas, 
provoking the ire of Timothy 
Simons, 
Patton 
Oswalt 
and 

Kumail Nanjiani. And while @
fuckjerry has attempted to expand 
on his social media enterprise, 
he continues to capitalize on 
providing 
“funny, 
relatable” 

content that already exists on other 
platforms and attempts to fit his 
own spritz of a joke in the caption 
to make it seem more “authentic.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

To me, it seems rather unfair 

for people to dilute posts, made by 
others who actually put in effort, 
to make a buck. Twitter accounts 
like tina (@tinatbh, 777k followers) 
and Common White Girl (@
girlposts, 6.44m followers) also 
share similar copycat approaches, 
generating a massive amount of 
followers from reposting funny 
videos and memes that are clearly 
from different sources. On a more 
psychological level, online copycat 
culture also reinforces the idea 

that in order to be funny or make 
money, you as a millennial should 
take advantage of social media 
and copy other people as well. 
Do people not see the plagiaristic 
façade behind these accounts? Is 
anything even original anymore? 
Does God exist? The answers to 
these questions are uncertain.

Granted, for those wanting to 

succeed, it is really hard to make 
your own individual voice stand 
out from a crowd of like-minded 
people. This is probably why it’s 
much easier to use other people’s 
work as a means of not only 
generating content, but attracting 
a bigger audience. Heck, I’ll even 
admit that in high school, I used 
to copy funny Tumblr posts and 
pass them off as my own Facebook 
statuses without crediting the 
original creator. I loved getting 
likes from people, but I didn’t 
know then what I know now 
about the morals of intellectual 
property. As a social media user, 
the most effective way to honestly 
portray your ideas and thoughts is 
through your own voice. It’s OK 
to be inspired and influenced by 
other artists and yes, sometimes 
using borrowing (and crediting) 
the work of another person can 
help articulate your idea for an 
essay or article more clearly. But if 
you want to make a genuine living, 
please don’t try and steal someone 
else’s work and pass it off as your 
own. Simultaneously, even if you 
credit other people for using their 
work, it still doesn’t justify taking 
advantage of them and making 
gargantuan amounts of money. 
Sure, you might be able to score 
an interview with Katie Couric 
like TheFatJewish or create your 
own meme-based board game 
called “What Do You Meme?” like 
fuckjerry. But to quote from a cool 
Pinterest post I saw, “Create a life 
that feels good on the inside, not 
one that just looks good on the 
outside.”

The soul-sucking pit 

of capitalism

‘Bird’ is zany progress

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

If you do the same thing long 

enough, eventually something will 
stick. Hip hop 
is 
constantly 

changing, 
but 

that 
can 
be 

mostly 
attrib-

uted to new and 
unique 
artists 

bursting 
onto 

the scene year 
after year, rath-
er than estab-
lished stalwarts 
reinventing 
themselves album after album. 
Popular rap music is a revolving 
door; last year’s Bobby Shmurda 
was this year’s Fetty Wap, who has 
already been eclipsed by the unfor-
gettable Desiigner. Travis Scott is 
the guy who stands on the other 
side of that door, taking photos 
with rappers as they enter while 
covering his face and talking about 
“vibes.” It’s been a couple of years, 
and now he’s just “that guy.” It’s 
finally stuck.

Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight 

is a continuation of what Travis 
has always done; it’s like he just 
changed clothes and invented a 
new gang sign. He’ll never be as 
influential or memorable as any 
of the rappers he poses with, but 
that’s fine. Maybe “the culture” 
needs an annual aggregator in the 
form of a “Travis Scott Album” — a 
summary of the year’s most excit-
ing entrants and sonic trends.

Much like how Kanye West has 

made a living out of orchestrat-
ing unlikely collaborations (think: 
Chief Keef with Justin Vernon) 
to make music greater than the 
sum of its parts, Travis tailors 
the red carpet for each of his 
album’s guests. In a way, it’s actu-
ally remarkable how he coordi-

nates appearances from Kendrick 
Lamar and Andre 3000 to make a 
project that doesn’t feel like a DJ 
Khaled album. Yet, like Khaled, 
Travis Scott is more brand than 
man. The album credits just fuel 
his status as the shape-shifting kid 
with cool friends.

Even the title — Birds in the Trap 

Sing McKnight — feels fit for some 
sort of luxury-trap motion pic-
ture. It conjures imagery of doves 
pouring out of an Atlanta kitchen 
window while Curtis Snow cooks 
crack in a Pyrex pot. It has noth-
ing to do with his music, message, 
fans, whatever, but it sounds as 
cool as he wants it to be.

To focus too much on the con-

text of a Travis Scott album would 
be reductive in nature, though. At 
the end of the day, it’s 54 minutes 
of actual music. I can’t tell you to 
like or dislike it. If you only listen 
to music because it sounds cool 
on Xanax, I guess you’ll like this 
album. Executive-produced and 
mixed by Houston legend Mike 
Dean, Birds features some of the 
most lush production this year, 
ensuring that the project will at 
least rest easy on the ears.

“Coordinate” lurches under a 

synth melody from TM88, with 
a hook that’s guaranteed to fea-
ture on every fit-pic caption this 
year: “Coordinate the Xan with 
the lean in my rockstar skinnies”. 
The track feels mostly inspired by 
Metro Boomin’s record-breaking 
run through Summer 2015, and 
Xanax too.

“Way Back” features classic 

GOOD Music ad-libs and Swizz 
Beatz vocal samples while lift-
ing a synth melody straight from 
MadeinTYO’s 
“Uber 
Every-

where.” Travis juxtaposes nostal-
gia for Dark Twisted Fantasy-era 
West with newer and more dis-
posable SoundCloud-rap, which is 
actually a creative palette unique 

to him. Swizz’s voice echoes and 
reverberates off the walls of Tra-
vis’s imaginary trap; neon-haired 
friends nod in enjoyment.

“Through the Late Night” is 

a song about staying up late, at 
night, while your parents sleep 
down the hall. Kid Cudi finally 
collaborates 
with 
his 
surro-

gate child, humming for most of 
his verse before rapping about 
dimethyltryptamine and “effer-
vescent vibes.” Paying homage, 
Travis actually interpolates lyrics 
from Cudi’s 2009 smash hit “Day 
‘N’ Night,” another song about not 
sleeping.

The album’s standout track, 

“Goosebumps,” has shades of 
“Antidote” — Travis’s most suc-
cessful pop crossover attempt thus 
far. The Cardo and Yung Exclu-
sive beat is reminiscent of the 
atmospheric tones that character-
ized Kendrick Lamar’s untitled 
unmastered., but with Travis’s 
knack for earworm melodies and 
textures layered on top. Kendrick 
himself makes an appearance and 
drops the best verse of the entire 
album, alternating flows like he’s 
trying to dodge the beat. He moves 
to a steep falsetto after mirroring 
the melody of the hook, stuttering 
and stopping to catch his breath 
but moving again before you can 
even catch a glimpse.

All in all, the new Travis Scott 

album sounds nice. The beats are 
cool. No one will complain if you 
play this at a party. Your friends 
might admit it could have been 
better “lyrically” and recom-
mend you check out Rodeo, where 
Travis really lays down his “life 
story” or something. If you’re into 
stuff like being outside, at night, 
while wearing vintage band tees, I 
recommend you check out the hot 
new Travis Scott album Birds in 
the Trap Sing McKnight, in stores 
now. Xans sold separately.

TV REVIEW
‘Mississippi’ explores 
grief on a spectrum 

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Watching “One Mississippi” 

feels like laughing at a funeral. 
The Amazon original, justly 
advertised as 
a dark com-
edy, 
falls 

somewhere 
between hav-
ing a fantastic 
sense of humor 
and being seri-
ously messed-
up. 
As 
the 

show explores 
weighty themes — death, loss, 
illness — a bitter hilarity levi-
tates the grief, just like that 
inappropriate smile that loves to 
wickedly curl during a sad story.

Inspired by comedian Tig 

Notaro’s (“In A World”) life, 
the series follows a version of 
Tig as she returns to her home-
town in Mississippi after her 
mother’s sudden death. As she 
copes, heavily relying on sar-
casm and deadpan jabs, she is 
forced to face her own mortality 
in the aftermath of her recent 
cancer treatments. While her 
twisted humor can often read 
as apathetic, perhaps it’s Nota-
ro’s aloofness that makes “One 
Mississippi” so endearing. It’s 
almost as if Tig is learning to 
walk all over again, taking her 
first steps in a world that is com-

pletely unfamiliar.

Grief has many faces; it can 

be cold and hot, loud and quiet, 
sometimes 
even 
completely 

silent. “One Mississippi” deli-
cately illustrates a spectrum of 
mourning through the strained 
relationship forced between Tig 
and her stepfather, Bill (John 
Rothman, “Ghostbusters”). Bill, 
a serious and reserved man, is 
completely removed from the 
humor that Tig uses to cope with 
tragedy. Riddled with obses-
sive-compulsive-tendencies, 
he actively distances himself 
from sentiment. Yet, however 
absent he seems at the begin-
ning, the series meticulously 
chips away at his cold exterior to 
reveal a genuine care for Tig. In 
“Effects,” the second of the six 
episodes released on Amazon 
Prime, Bill’s rigorous internet 
search for treatments of Tig’s C 
Diff (a bacterial disruption of the 
colon) leads to the episode’s gut-
wrenching punchline: a fecal 
transplant. The joke seems juve-
nile and uncomfortable, which 
is perhaps what makes laughing 
irresistible. But despite the slew 
of poop jokes that Tig doesn’t 
hesitate to share, Bill offers to be 
the fecal donor without hesita-
tion. Maybe that’s what family is 
all about?

While comedy is often used 

to take a break from the sad-
ness, the series employs a beau-

tiful artistry in its treatment of 
tragedy. The script isn’t packed 
with dialogue or soul-searching 
monologues on the meaning of 
life and death. Instead, pain and 
sadness are best articulated in 
just a few, well-selected words. 
On the night before the funeral, 
Tig’s girlfriend, Brooke (Casey 
Wilson, “Happy Endings”), tells 
her that tomorrow is a big day. 
“Every day is now a small day,” 
Tig replies.

As she retraces her steps 

throughout her hometown, Tig 
remembers her mother, Caroline 
(Rya Khilstedt, “Home Alone 
3”) in a series of flashbacks. 
Dressed in vibrant florals with 
a metallic snake coiled around 
her forearm, Caroline ironically 
breathes life into “One Missis-
sippi.” Memories of her are filled 
with laughter and spunk, char-
acteristics that are devoid in the 
shattered family she left behind. 
She is the source of happiness 
which, by itself, is laced bitter-
sweet.

While at times the acting 

feels stilted and the characters 
detached from their surround-
ings, the series is relatable 
to anyone who needs a little 
laughter to ease the pain. The 
soundtrack is riddled with the 
same irony, as Tig cues “One of 
Us is Dead” by The Earlies. It’s 
delicate and sarcastic; funny, yet 
unthinkably tragic.

O-Line faces growing expectations

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

All game long, you could see 

the discontent from fans: the 
Michigan football team wasn’t 
having 
success 
running 
the 

ball. Though the fourth-ranked 
Wolverines racked up nearly 120 
yards on the ground, it averaged 
just 2.9 yards per carry on 41 
rushing attempts — not the ratio 
it was looking for. Central Florida 
was jamming five to six Knights 
in the box throughout all four 
quarters, 
quieting 
Michigan’s 

rushing efforts.

Though the Wolverines still 

emerged victorious in a 51-14 
rout, some fans were upset with 
the running game, and a great 
deal of that blame was put on 
the offensive line. Fifth-year 
senior right tackle Kyle Kalis 
wasn’t too upset with the finger-
pointing, though. He’s grown 
used to it after hearing about it 
in previous years. 

“(The fans) gotta relax,” Kalis 

said. “They gotta relax. We’re fine. 
… Most fans don’t understand, 
they don’t really understand the 
game of football to the level that 
people who play it do. When they 
stack the box like that and they 
stop the run game, you don’t get 
mad as an O-lineman, you pass the 
ball because that’s just, scheme-
wise, that’s the only option you 
have. So that’s what we did.” 

Back in 2014, when Michigan 

finished 115th in FBS Total 
Offense rankings, the offensive 
line took a lot of the criticism 
for its 5-7 season. Thinking back 
to it now, Kalis still thinks the 
blame was misattributed, but he 
understands how fans easily grew 
frustrated with the offensive 
line and used it as a scapegoat. 
That criticism will remain as 
expectations grow for the highly 
touted Wolverines. 

“Hopefully one day, the old 

stink will be gone,” Kalis said. “I 
think we’re doing a good job of 

trying to eliminate that, because 
it’s not there, I’m telling you.” 

The 
matchup 
with 
UCF 

proved that Michigan can handle 
pressure against the run by 
changing gears, and, if anything, 
it was good exposure for what 
may come later in the season. 

“As an offensive line, it’s nice, 

because even if we aren’t that 
successful in the run, just getting 
the practice at that, getting the 
practice to see that many guys in 
the box,” Kalis said. “Eventually, 
down the season, down the 
line, we may have to play a team 
that does it again to us in a dire 
situation when we have to run the 
ball, so we have to be prepared.” 

Throughout Saturday’s game, 

the Wolverines did what they 
needed to do and what they will 
need to do in the future when 

they can’t run the ball: they went 
through the air. 

Redshirt sophomore Wilton 

Speight threw for 312 yards and 
four 
touchdowns, 
including 

a 
45-yard 

touchdown 
pass to fifth-
year 
senior 

wide 
receiver 

Amara Darboh 
for his longest 
pass 
of 
the 

season. 

“Coach 

Harbaugh was 
actually talking 
about it the other day, about how 
he hasn’t had a quarterback who 
could complete the deep post 
route in like five or six years or 
something, on a consistent basis,” 
Kalis said. “Wilton, being able to 

complete those big passes this early 
on is a good thing for all of us.” 

Kalis 
thinks 
that 
Speight 

is doing a “hell of a job,” and 
when you couple that with the 

prolific 
wide 

receivers and 
the protection 
coming 
from 

the 
offensive 

line, Michigan 
has a winning 
recipe. 

On 
the 

offensive 
line 
itself, 

three 
fifth-

year senior starters (Kalis, Erik 
Magnuson 
and 
Ben 
Braden) 

have led the way with help from 
junior center Mason Cole and 
sophomore 
left 
tackle 
Grant 

Newsome. 
Competition 
from 

newcomers like freshmen Ben 
Bredeson and Michael Onwenu 
has made the group even hotter. 
Without a doubt, the offensive 
line is experiencing the most 
depth it has had in recent years. 

Finally, after playing with 

teams much less experienced 
than the 2016 Wolverines, Kalis is 
getting to see what it’s like to play 
for the No. 4 team in the nation, 
which is as high of an honor 
Michigan has seen since the 2007 
Rose Bowl. 

“A lot of guys might say, ‘The 

rankings don’t mean anything, 
we don’t care about the rankings,’ 
but no, we care about the 
rankings,” Kalis said. “We want 
to be the highest ranked as we 
can possibly be. The expectation 
is getting higher every week, so 
that’s the goal.”

Kinnel becoming a special teams ace

Sophomore safety 
tipped two game-
changing punts 
Saturday vs. UCF

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Tyree Kinnel didn’t have 

to wait long for the moment 
he had anticipated. About 80 
seconds into Michigan’s game 
against 
Central 
Florida 
on 

Saturday, Kinnel lined up on 
the punt-block team — Grant 
Perry to his left, Brandon 
Watson to his right.

Kinnel knew one of the three 

was going to get a hand on the ball.

All 
week, 
Michigan 
had 

observed weaknesses to exploit 
in UCF’s punt team and saw an 
opportunity to strike early. Sure 
enough, with seven Wolverines 
against five Knights on the line 
of scrimmage, two UCF players 
leaked out to cover the punt. 
“We were bringing quite a few 
up the middle, and I knew they 
had overloaded a side,” Kinnel 
said.

Kinnel was the difference-

maker. 
Perry 
engaged 
with 

one member of the last line of 
blockers, and Watson took the 
other two. That freed space up 
the middle for Kinnel to lunge 
and tip the kick.

The altered punt traveled 

just 13 yards, but Michigan’s 
offense went three-and-out on 

the ensuing possession. So the 
defense forced another Knights 
punt, the Wolverines lined up in 
the same formation and Kinnel 
got 
there 

again.

This time, 

the punt went 
27 yards, and 
Michigan 
took over in 
UCF territory 
and 
scored 

on 
each 
of 

its next six 
possessions. 
Whatever 
may have happened without 
that edge in field position, it 
was clear Kinnel’s fingertips 
changed the game.

The sophomore safety from 

Wayne, Ohio, has been close 
before. Last year, Kinnel nearly 
blocked a punt against Ohio 
State 
in 
the 
regular-season 

finale, 
only 

to 
draw 

a 
flag 
for 

roughing the 
kicker 
and 

extend 
the 

drive. 
The 

Buckeyes 
scored 
the 

first 
points 

of the game 
four 
plays 

later 
and 

went on to win 42-13.

“(This time,) Coach just told 

me, ‘Don’t go after it, just go get 
it,’ ” Kinnel said. “And if you’re 
taught the right way, you’ll go 
get it.”

By now, Kinnel is familiar 

with fine lines. He knows the 
difference 
between 
blocking 

punts and coming close, between 
seeing the field and standing 
on the sidelines, even between 
winning programs and losing 
programs.

Kinnel’s senior year of high 

school was the infamous 2014 
season, 
in 
which 
Michigan 

finished 5-7 and ousted coach 
Brady Hoke, to whom Kinnel 
committed. 
Unlike 
several 

other recruits, Kinnel honored 
his commitment and started 
attending Michigan last fall.

Since then, he has fought to 

see the field. He was a standout 
on offense and defense in high 
school, but never played special 
teams. Only when he arrived in 
Ann Arbor did he see the unit as 
his path onto the field.

“It’s just attitude and effort 

when it comes to special teams,” 
Kinnel said. “It’s about knowing 
who wants it more, knowing it’s 
a key factor in the game.”

He 
learned 
that 
lesson 

from 
former 
special 
teams 

coordinator John Baxter, who 

spent one season at Michigan 
last year before returning to 
Southern 
California. 
Many 

regard Baxter as one of the 
top special teams coaches in 
the country, citing his track 
record of blocked kicks. But the 
Wolverines didn’t connect on 
any last season before tipping 
two punts and two field-goal 
attempts Saturday.

“The schemes aren’t really 

much different,” Kinnel said. 
“I think we’re just giving more 
effort.”

Just more than a year after 

trying special teams for the first 
time, Kinnel now sees that job as 
his role on the team, certainly a 
vital one Saturday.

As for defense, Kinnel has 

made 
progress 
there, 
too, 

seeing time as a reserve safety 
behind seniors Delano Hill and 
Dymonte Thomas. To a coaching 
staff that values every effort, his 
success in the punting game has 
to be of value.

“I don’t think it goes ignored,” 

Kinnel said. “(I) ended up 
getting special teams player of 
the week, so they like it. It’s a 
coaches’ thing, how that goes.”

For the time being, Kinnel 

still wants more on special 
teams. He thinks he may soon 
be able to fully block a kick, 
getting a hand on it instead of 
just a fingertip. The punt block is 
one of the fastest plays in sports, 
where 
milliseconds 
separate 

an altered kick and a perfectly 
executed one.

But 
in 
many 
aspects, 

Kinnel has learned to trust his 
preparation. He knew the punt 
block unit could break through 
Saturday, and it did. And in 2014, 
he knew Michigan’s fortunes 
would change, and they did.

“In high school, when they 

were struggling, I think I always 
wanted to be here,” Kinnel said. 
“I think things were going to 
change regardless.”

Wolverines fueled by youth movement

After losing top goal 
scorers from 2015, 
‘M’ enjoying early-

season success

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

At 
first 
glance, 
the 

10th-ranked team in the nation 
beating the first-ranked team 
doesn’t seem like much of an 
upset.

But when you consider just 

who the Michigan field hockey 
lost to graduation, its 1-0 victory 
over then-No. 1 North Carolina 
is much more impressive.

Michigan (4-1), now ranked 

eighth in the nation, graduated 
not only both of last season’s 
leading goal scorers in All-
American center back Lauren 
Thomas and forward Shannon 
Scavelli, but also its entire 
backfield — a trio that had 
played together through the 
seasons 
and 
represented 
a 

wealth of experience.

“It’s always hard losing your 

seniors,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We had a 
first team All-American that 
we lost. The biggest thing was 
our backfield had three players 
that played together all the 
time and were 
a really solid 
unit, and we 
lost all of them 
at 
the 
same 

time. So there 
were a lot of 
shoes to fill in 
the 
backfield 

experience-
wise.”

Despite 

the 
shortage 

of returning players, though, 
Michigan has clearly coped 
well: In addition to the win over 
the Tar Heels, the Wolverines 

tallied a 2-1 victory over then-
No. 11 Stanford, as well.

Just how has Michigan gotten 

off 
to 
such 

a 
scorching 

start?

The answer 

lies 
in 
the 

development 
of 
the 

freshman 
class. 
It’s 

cliche, but it’s 
hard to argue. 
And there may 
be no better 

example than Bree Bednarski.

The freshman forward has 

serious speed — the type that 
allows her to reach balls even 

her teammates think are headed 
out of bounds.

But to Pankratz, Bednarski’s 

ability to transition quickly to 
the collegiate level has been an 
equally impressive aspect of her 
game.

It’s a trait that — perhaps 

unlike Bednarski’s speed — is 
shared by all six freshmen on 
the team.

“We did throw (the freshmen) 

in the deep end of the pool 
pretty quickly but so far, so 
good,” Pankratz said. “They’re 
really rising to the challenge, 
training super hard and learning 
every day, so we’ve been really 
pleased.”

Added junior midfielder Katie 

Trombetta: “When we get on the 
field, (the underclassmen) are 
really performing and coming 
into their own, 
so you forget 
that 
they’re 

freshmen 
or 

sophomores. 
I 
rely 
on 

someone 
like 

Bree, 
who’s 

a 
freshman, 

just as much 
as I rely on 
(redshirt 
junior 
forward) Carly (Bennett).”

There’s a clear lack of a 

“class division” with this year’s 
team, which Trombetta says is 

evidence of an evolution in team 
culture over the past couple 
years.

“Where we 

are now (from) 
my freshman 
year, 
the 

dynamics have 
changed 
and 

that’s 
why 

we’ve done so 
much 
better 

since 
then,” 

Trombetta 
said. 
“Just 

the 
level 
of 

community 
and 
equalness, 

not separating by class, really 
being a real team that just 
plays together and works hard 

together.”

With this year’s team, the 

upperclassmen say they don’t 
think 
of 
the 
freshmen 
or 

sophomores in terms of on-field 
experience — they’re simply 
“younger friends,” as Trombetta 
puts it, who are eager to learn 
the ropes.

It may sound idealized, but 

the Wolverines say everyone 
simply gets along, and that’s 
what has allowed Michigan’s 
freshmen to adapt so quickly 
and successfully.

With the Wolverines meshed 

together as a more cohesive unit, 
they’re able to compete with the 
nation’s best despite their youth.

“A couple of our teammates 

from 
last 
year 
have 
come 

back and watched (us play),” 
Trombetta said. “The biggest 
thing they say is that there’s no 
one superstar, and we really do 
play as one big team that passes. 
Everyone is getting subbed in, 
everyone’s getting cycled in, 
everyone knows what their job 
is. It’s very much one big team 
that plays together the entire 
time.”

Bunting, Wanglers try hands at apparel

Former QB enlists 
current players to 
work on “Valiant”

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

Normally, when a Michigan 

football player walks around 
Ann Arbor, it’s other students 
doing double takes.

But a couple weeks ago, red-

shirt sophomore tight end Ian 
Bunting was the one playing 
paparazzi when he saw another 
student walking around in a hat 
he recognized.

“I kind of snuck behind 

them,” Bunting said, “and took 
a picture of it and sent it to Mr. 
Wangler.”

Since this past summer, Bun-

ting has been working with 

John, Jared and Jack Wangler 
on a new apparel line called 
“Valiant.” Bunting said the elder 
Wangler — of Wangler-to-Cart-
er fame — brought the idea to 
his sons and Bunting. Together, 
they started up 
a side enter-
prise.

Now, 
the 

fruits of that 
labor are for 
sale in the M 
Den. 
Valiant 

hats, 
visors 

and shirts sell 
in 
the 
same 

store as Michi-
gan’s 
“Jump-

man” apparel.

And according to the M Den’s 

Rose Balzer, the Valiant gear is 
selling better than you might 
think.

“People are absolutely eating 

it up,” Balzer said. “They love 

it almost as much as the Nike 
stuff.”

The differences are subtle. 

Balzer 
noted 
the 
women’s 

apparel having three-quarter-
length sleeved shirts, V-cut 

necklines 
and 
hoods, 

and while the 
Nike apparel 
is sleek and 
clearly 
well-

liked, 
Bal-

zer says the 
Valiant 
gear 

offers 
slight 

variations 
that go a long 
way.

“A little different niche, just 

a little bit,” Bunting said of the 
Valiant apparel. “We love the 
Jordan stuff, too, though.

“It’s just sort of like a little bit 

of a different target audience.”

For Bunting, even the meet-

ings have been fun. Tuesday, 
he recalled flying out to New 
Jersey for a meeting with a part 
owner that was supposed to be 
quick — 45 minutes to an hour.

Instead, “We ended up being 

in there for like five hours, just 
bouncing ideas off each other,” 
Bunting said. “It was sweet. 
Really got the ball rolling.”

Bunting said the players went 

through the school’s compliance 
department and received clear-
ance to work with the company 
— “It took a little while, but we 
got it figured out,” he said — and 
that Mr. Wangler had secured 
the licensing to use the block ‘M’ 
on its apparel.

For now, Valiant’s identity is 

tied inseparably to the Michigan 
brand. Its name comes from the 
Wolverines’ fight song, and Bun-
ting and the Wanglers are all 
Wolverines. But soon, the com-
pany could take on an identity 

of its own. Bunting is interested 
in the prospect of selling street 
fashion, too, as well as the other 
design and business aspects he 
presently enjoys.

And for now, he has a measure 

of exclusivity. Wearing a Valiant 
hat after practice Tuesday, a 

reporter asked him how much it 
retailed for. He responded that 
the particular hat, with a wide, 
maize block “V,” wasn’t for sale 
yet.

Moments later, though, Bun-

ting reassured: “I’m sure even-
tually we’ll sell this one.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 14, 2016

THE NEW* DETROIT

*GENTRIFIED


I

t’s that time of year again. Football has kicked off, 
classes have started, the homework is beginning to 
pile up and the broadcast networks are starting to 

wake up from summer hibernation with new and return-
ing series making their fall debuts in the next few weeks. 
For a long time, the new fall season was like opening a 
new pack of presents on Christmas morning. Yet it seems 
the pile of presents has gone from everything I could ever 
hope for to one filled with socks and lumps of coal. Maybe 
it’s because my tastes have gotten stricter or the world of 
#PeakTV gives me more shows to watch, but I don’t feel 
that same sense of wonder toward the new network sea-
son like I have in the past. There appear to be some gems, 
but this year’s programming mostly seems to be rehashes 
of old concepts or just plain unnecessary.

I want to be hopeful about the new network season 

each year. Each set of new shows brings a huge set of 
potential. No networks, except for maybe HBO, spend 
the amount of money to make and market television that 
the broadcast networks do. They have plentiful resources 
(such as money and talent) to make television that’s new 
and exciting. So, when the new network season comes 
around, I want to have hope that the new crop of shows 
will bring something exhilarating to the table.

However, that doesn’t seem to be the case this year. 

The biggest offender of creating generic series is CBS, 
which will put out a new set of fall shows that feature 
stars, premises and genres that will be familiar to their 
viewers. There’s a good reason for this as the network 
has built its brand on bringing in a relatively older audi-
ence to shows with known formats. Its big new drama is 
Michael Weatherly’s (coming off a long run on “NCIS”) 
“Bull,” in which he plays a psychiatrist who’s a trial con-
sultant. It looks like a basic law drama with a twist, but 
not enough of a twist to create separation from the other, 
better legal dramas on TV.

A part of this is the way I watch TV has completely 

changed over the past several years. When I was a young 
teenager in middle school, my parents didn’t necessarily 
let me watch all of the dramas on basic or premium cable 
with a few exceptions. (They weren’t exactly going to 

let a 13-year-old watch “Nip/Tuck” or “The Sopranos”). 
This meant I was largely left to the broadcast networks 
to find entertainment. So, each new fall brought me a new 
group of potential shows to join my regular rotation, and 
I sometimes spent many weeks waiting for series like the 
short-lived “V” or “Back to You” to reach their full poten-
tial. I would spend hours on Hulu sampling each one in 
the group, eventually finding some I would stick with for 
the long haul. The 2007-2008 season was particularly 
memorable because it brought “Pushing Daisies” and 
“Chuck” into my life, both of which remain some of my 
favorites today.

Now, I don’t necessarily have the time to go and sample 

each show like I used to. I miss the spirit of innovation 

that brought shows such as “Daisies” and “Chuck” to the 
air. Only The CW seems to be carrying on that torch, 
with recent dramas like “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and “Jane 
the Virgin” that push the mantle of what it means to be 
a broadcast drama. I understand why the broadcast net-
works remain risk-averse. Their goal is to reach as many 
people as possible and shows like “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” 
might not be the best way to do that. Still, there’s so much 
amazing television out there right now that it’s hard for 
me to even try shows like “Kevin Can Wait” or “Bull.” 
They have so many resources to be creative that I can’t 
help but feel disappointed when I see such overdone and 
well-trodden premises yet another time.

Terrorist attack kills scores in Nice, France, Hollande 

says.

That’s the notification that popped up on my phone 

after midnight on July 15 as I lay in my bed, in Grenoble, 
just 300 kilometers away.

A shooter opened fire and killed more than 80 people 

while driving his van into a crowd. The victims — who 
were watching the Bastille Day fireworks — were cele-
brating the anniversary of the start of the French Revo-
lution. They were celebrating their country and their 
patriotism. They were laughing, rejoicing and living life 
before it was so unfairly taken away from them, far too 
soon.

After reading the breaking news story, I lay in bed, no 

longer tired despite the eventful day I’d had. I had been 
enjoying the day, watching the fireworks and engaging to 
the fullest in the national holiday. Not once did I ponder 
what I’d do if someone opened fire in the crowds I was in. 
My mind was racing; where would I have run? Would I 
have hidden or tried to escape? Would I have been able to 
help others around me, had they been hurt?

For the first time I was in France, I felt truly afraid. 

People had mentioned to me before I left that the coun-
try wasn’t very safe, and they asked me if I was scared 
to go there. “Are your parents cool with you going?” and 
“Aren’t you a little concerned about your safety?” were 
questions I got more often than “Are you excited to go?” 
France has been the target of numerous killings in the 
name of the Islamic State over the last year; however, 
none have occurred in Grenoble. When people asked 
me about it, I usually shrugged the idea off, noting that 
I was equally likely, if not more, to be shot in the United 
States. But now that it had happened somewhat close to 
me and I was so far away from my home and family, I felt 
scared for the world. I felt sad that these senseless mur-
ders and killings were continuing to happen, becoming 
more of a norm than a shock. I felt immense grief for the 
families who had lost parents, children and friends on a 
day of celebration and unity. And lastly, I felt both guilt 
and relief simultaneously, for being safe in my warm bed 
while others around me suffered and mourned.

As I lay awake thinking the day over, I thought of all 

the fear this would instill in people. Every day, we cancel 
trips, avoid crowds, watch over our shoulders and gen-
erate distrust for others out of fear they might hurt us. 
We anxiously look around airports and busy train sta-
tions wondering if this is the day someone will blow it all 
up. Though it might not be a constant and daily train of 
thought, at some point each of us is faced with the reality 
that there are people in this world who want to hurt us 
and terrorize us.

I thought back to the first day of the program in 

Grenoble: The program hosted an orientation for us to 
acclimate to the city. One of the biggest topics was how 
we would address an attack in the city, where we would 
go, to whom we should reach out. It suddenly seemed 

very real.

In the United States, I feel a sense of comfort and 

detachment, as if these sad realities are far away from 
home and the things that I hear about on the news 
from time to time. But being in France, in a place where 
extremist attacks are becoming too often an occurrence, 
the gravity of the situation became so much more real.

Despite the sudden feeling of uneasiness, we were told 

to remain calm. The program would go on and none of 
us would be going home. We were told that Nice was far 
from Grenoble and to reassure parents and friends that 
we were not hurt.

After the tragedy in Nice, the city felt a lot more on 

edge. My host mom sat me down the following week 
and warned me that even in the small town of Grenoble, 
there were groups of people to look out for. In class, we 
talked about how the government was addressing these 
issues and how the French people reacted to these types 
of attacks. Overall, there was a strong sense of fear of the 
unknown, fear of people that look or act differently from 
ourselves.

When I got back to the United States, the Nice attacks 

were often top of the list in conversation topics about my 
trip. “How did that affect you? Were you scared? Did you 
want to come home?” I won’t deny that being so close 
to something so horrific scared the crap out of me and 
definitely made me much warier of my surroundings. But 
never did I want to come home because of it.

I felt like this was an opportunity to experience the 

world outside of my perceived safe zone in the States. I 
feel that too often we isolate ourselves from the outside 
world and reject anything different from our own agen-
das. We are more concerned about our own safety than 
embracing life to the fullest and appreciating other ways 
of life before becoming immediately suspicious.

For the rest of my time in Grenoble, I wanted to have 

the best time of my life and experience the things I 
came to experience. After all, I only had six weeks to get 
to know a city, a culture and a language. Even if I was 
scared, the chances of anything happening to me or my 
peers were improbable. I was vigilant and aware of my 
surroundings, but I didn’t let the senseless terror stop me 
from experiencing my life.

When Shelby Oberstaedt was a kid, her sub-

urban family was hesitant to travel downtown 
to attend Detroit Tigers games, fearing a reputa-
tion that painted the city as crime-ridden. And 
while living downtown as her now-husband 
played football at Wayne State University, she 
said, those same feelings of insecurity remained.

“Living here was a bit scary,” she recalled. 

“Fifteen years ago I don’t even think my family 
would’ve come down here.”

However, Oberstaedt has chosen to stick 

around in Detroit, as a general manager for the 
Jolly Pumpkin Pizzeria and Brewery — one of 
many individuals part of the rapid process of 
gentrification Detroit has undergone over the 
last two decades. Gentrification, a term popular-
ized in the ‘70s, describes the process by which 
low-income communities are renovated and 
rebuilt, attracting young professionals but also 
usually driving up real estate prices and relocat-
ing pre-existing residents and businesses.

Cities such as Brooklyn, San Francisco and 

Portland that have undergone this process are 
hailed today as havens for young urban profes-
sionals seeking a culturally vibrant urban expe-
rience that comes with a hefty price tag — a far 
cry from the affordable and even struggling rep-
utations once attached to these communities.

In Detroit, the area known as Cass Corridor 

was rebranded as Midtown in the early 2000s, 
in an effort to redirect a history of poverty and 
blight. Following the city’s declaration of bank-
ruptcy in 2013, multiple large-scale efforts to 
spur economic growth were launched, includ-
ing a $650 million development plan involving 
the purchase of neglected buildings to be turned 
into high-end retailers and luxury apartments. 
Though many of these properties had been 
vacant for years, wealthy enterprise and spikes 
in rent are now characterizing the transform-
ing reality of Midtown, Detroit, in large part 
because of those efforts.

The city’s crime rate also seems to be on 

a steady decline, with the Free Press report-
ing a 23-percent drop in stolen automobiles, an 
18-percent fall in robberies and a 15-percent 
drop in burglaries since 2014, though Detroit 
still maintains the number-one spot on Forbes’ 
annual Most Dangerous Cities ranking.

The city has also recently drawn national 

attention for the widespread failure of its pub-
lic school system, magnified by a mass “sickout” 
that made headlines last May, in which 1,500 
teachers called in sick on May 2 after learning 
their pay was not guaranteed past June. The 
demonstration temporarily closed 94 of the 
city’s 97 schools.

As Detroit continues to undergo changes 

and face challenges, some residents and busi-
ness owners argue the gentrification of Mid-
town is largely positive, providing jobs for locals 
and incentives for corporations to invest in the 
economy. However, others raise concerns that 
gentrification often overlooks the complexity of 
poverty, paving over socioeconomic and racial 
tensions with rapid real estate growth that 
drives out marginalized communities. In addi-
tion to spikes in property values, such develop-
ments exacerbate the wealth disparity between 
those in and outside of the area of gentrification.

rounding Midtown earn on average 25 percent 
less per year than their central counterparts, 
according to The Guardian.

The Jolly Pumpkin Pizzeria & Brewery, 

where Oberstaedt works, is an upscale pub 
located in Detroit’s Cass Corridor. President 
Barack Obama reportedly ordered a burger, 
salad and truffle fries there before attending 
the North American International Auto Show 
last January.

But Jolly Pumpkin, which opened its Detroit 

location in April 2015, is just one of many high-
end businesses to open in Midtown within the 
past few years. Shinola, a luxury watch, bicy-
cle and leather-good brand opened its flagship 
store just down the street from Jolly Pump-
kin in 2013. The company boasts the return 
of manufacturing jobs to the city, operating 
out of an old auto lab owned by the College of 
Creative Studies but also assembling watches 
made of parts reportedly created overseas. 
John Varvatos, a Detroit-born men’s fashion 
designer, opened the doors to a new store loca-
tion on Woodward Avenue in April 2015 with 
a star-studded black carpet complete with an 
Alice Cooper concert.

“It’s kind of crazy, to be honest,” Oberstaedt 

said of the neighborhood’s turnaround. “Now 
I feel comfortable walking to my car and park-
ing nearby, and you see people from the sub-
urbs coming here, and coming here to go out to 
eat or to go shopping and it’s not cheap shops 
— they’re expensive shops.”

Oberstaedt estimated about 95 percent of 

her employees live in downtown Detroit, most 
within walking distance of the restaurant. 
Some are Wayne State University students 
originally from the suburbs while others are 
native Detroiters. Some live in expensive new 
lofts on Woodward Avenue while others live 
closer to the restaurant, paying less than $500 
dollars a month in rent.

Speaking to concerns of gentrification 

and rising rents in Midtown, Oberstaedt sees 
Jolly Pumpkin’s impact on the city as a largely 
positive one, claiming it mainly promotes fair 
workplace practices while renewing pride and 
interest in the city of Detroit.

“I think there’s just, like, that appeal to be 

something hip and cool and someplace that 
people want to visit,” Oberstaedt said, not-
ing a boost in local morale following Obama’s 
visit to the restaurant and after other excit-
ing events, such as an album release at Third 
Man Records, Jack White’s record label, which 
opened its Detroit branch in November 2015.

Oberstaedt added that Jolly Pumpkin also 

provides its staff members with desirable and 
much-needed employment opportunities.

“There’s a lot of people that were being paid 

minimum wage — and barely that — and work-
ing in underprivileged work environments, 
and they come to us and they’re like ‘Wow this 
is a good company to work for,’ ” Oberstaedt 
said. “You’re bringing jobs to their community, 
where they don’t have to have transportation 
to get to them, and they’re not the lowest paid 
jobs either. It’s giving them the opportunity to, 
first off, make a little bit more money but also 
be treated a little bit better.”

Paul Green, assistant shop manager at 

Moosejaw — a major outdoor recreation out-
fitter that opened a Detroit location in 2012 — 
echoed Oberstaedt’s opinion of the impact of a 
booming Midtown on Detroit’s spirit and self-
confidence. He noted that, in previous years, 
international tourists visiting the city were 
most likely there for the annual Auto Show 
or business-related trips. Recently, however, 
tourists visiting his shop from places includ-
ing China, Denmark, the United Kingdom and 
South Africa said they were visiting Detroit 
because they “just wanted to see it.”

Though he’s aware Moosejaw’s pricey out-

door gear may be out of reach for most Detroi-
ters, Green said he remains hopeful that the 
economic successes of a booming Midtown 
will eventually reach the city’s struggling 
outer neighborhoods.

“The hope, at least from my end, is that 

even though we can’t directly provide goods 
to people who really don’t have the money to 
buy most of our products, we are contributing 
in the redevelopment of the city, which will 
eventually benefit everybody,” Green said. “Or 
it should. It darn well better.”

Green described the process of gentrifi-

cation — and more specifically rent hikes in 
downtown Detroit — as frustrating. He main-
tained hope, however, that city officials would 
prioritize the needs of the majority of Detroit’s 
population when faced with issues of zoning 
and urban planning in the city.

“When I think about it, I try and hope that 

the right things happen — that people make the 
right decisions in government,” Green added. 
“They’re the ones who can decide whether 
or not a vacant property becomes affordable 
housing or it becomes a retail unit or an expen-
sive loft.”

***

For some residents, however, the perspec-

tive on the impact of new businesses is a bit 
different.

LSA senior Elizabeth Gonzalez, who grew 

up in southwest Detroit, said she finds the gen-
trification of Midtown problematic because 
her community has not yet received the ben-
efits of the city’s economic growth.

“That’s the problem I have when I see arti-

cles that say things like ‘oh, Detroit is bounc-
ing back,’ because my side of Detroit looks the 
exact same,” Gonzalez said. “My Detroit has 
not changed one bit … Detroit is bouncing back 
for people from the suburbs, the hipsters mov-
ing in, but the rest of Detroit is still the same.”

Art & Design senior Jessica Gray, who grew 

up in Detroit’s Seven Mile area on the western 
side of the city, specifically noted the racial 
implications of gentrification in Detroit. She 
said while the restoration of Midtown sends 
messages of hope and progress to the pub-
lic, decades of neglect are felt by those who 
inhabit the city — those who have been calling 
attention to the city’s need for economic revi-
talization long before high-end retailers made 
Detroit fashionable.

“It becomes a problem because, are we, the 

Black people that are there, the hispanic peo-
ple that are there — are we not enough to have 
good things?” she said. “That’s basically how 

it makes us feel, as the people who have been 
pushing Detroit this whole time. We’re not 
enough to have a rail built before now? We’re 
not enough to have all of these profitable busi-
nesses?”

Gray also pointed to racial divides poten-

tially created by rising rent prices downtown. 

“Gentrification is a problem because they’re 

not helping the people they’re pushing out,” 
she said.

Richard Smith, a western Detroit native, 

expressed concern over the disappearance of 
Black-owned businesses in Midtown.

“The migration here and everybody mov-

ing back downtown is moving the Black people 
out,” he said. “There’s this great New Detroit 
but where are all the Black businesses? They 
moved all the Black businesses from down 
there.”

Smith’s concerns are reflected by research 

from Brian Doucet, assistant professor of 
urban geography at Erasmus University Col-
lege in the Netherlands, who wrote in an 
article published by The Guardian in 2015 that 
— while many benefit from the desirable trans-
formations produced by gentrification — those 
transformations often depend on the displace-
ment of minority populations.

“Those able to afford to live there enjoy 

great restaurants and bars, well-paid employ-
ment, safe and attractive neighbourhoods and 
reliable public transit,” Doucet writes. “The 
problem is most Detroiters cannot afford to 
live here. And like everything else in Southeast 
Michigan, race is one of the dominant factors. 
In a city that is 85% African American, Greater 
Downtown is becoming increasingly white.”

***

Ren Farley, a University of Michigan pub-

lic policy professor, specializes in the history 
and future of Detroit’s social and industrial 
landscape. He identified the flux of the city’s 
history as complex, with the current state of 
gentrification as neither purely positive nor 
negative.

“It’s complicated. First of all, Detroit is close 

to hitting bottom, so new investments com-
ing into Detroit, it seems to me, are generally 
desirable,” Farley said, noting that the incom-
ing high-end retail, real estate and restaurants 
will increase the tax-base of the city along 
with employment. 

“Shinola has made a point of hiring local 

people to assemble their expensive products,” 
Farley added. “Nike is one of a number of shops 
that tries to emphasize that they are involved 
in a community. When Whole Foods moved in, 
they made a point of hiring local workers and 
including some local products in what they 
sell, so these are what seems to me, quite favor-
able signs.”

However, Farley noted that these benefits 

come with drawbacks, as the jobs such com-
panies create are split between high-tech jobs 
and entry-level labor.

“Certainly, many of those are high-tech jobs 

and financial services jobs that require creden-
tials beyond those typically found for Detroit 
residents,” he continued. “But still, the pres-
ence of those jobs generates a lot of other jobs, 
providing the services those buildings need 

and the services that people working there 
need.”

Though Farley identified developments in 

Detroit as something of an economic renais-
sance, he questioned the impact of revitaliza-
tion — and more specifically who it’s for. Farley 
said these developments are so geographically 
concentrated in Midtown that one cannot be 
certain employment opportunities will open 
up for Detroit’s outer neighborhoods, which 
face high levels of poverty and unemployment. 

“The major question is whether that revi-

talization will help the people who live in the 
neighborhoods around Detroit or will the ben-
efits of revitalization primarily be for people 
from outside who come into Detroit to work at 
the new jobs that are becoming available and 
make some profits in the investments in new 
hotels, restaurants and apartment buildings 
that are opening,” he said. 

Gonzalez described Midtown as anoth-

er world compared to her own struggling 
neighborhood, calling Midtown a “tourist 
attraction” and suggesting the downtown 
developments were an improper use of funds.

“That money is needed elsewhere,” she said. 

“Our school systems are falling apart. I don’t 
think it’s fair, because all that money is going 
to places where it shouldn’t be, and it’s attract-
ing people from the outside. It’s not doing any-
thing for people from the inside.”

Kalaan Nix, who has lived on Detroit’s west 

side his entire life, said he could see both posi-
tives and negatives — while he’s grateful for 
the increased job opportunities presented by 
the increase of businesses moving to Midtown, 
he’s also hesitant to call the migration of peo-
ple into the city a success for native Detroiters. 

“There’s always two sides to a coin, so if 

there’s a positive there’s a negative,” Nix said. 
“So, to some extent, people moving back into 
the city isn’t helping solve the problem for 
people who live in the city — it’s just making 
it seem like ‘OK, well, we have people com-
ing back because the city looks nice, but what 
about the people who are already here that 
haven’t left or couldn’t leave?’ ”

Even amid her critique of the city’s rapid 

gentrification, Gonzalez acknowledged that 
encouraging people to move to Detroit was not 
the problem, echoing some of Nix’s sentiments. 
Rather, she said, an abundance of visitors who 
fail to engage or take part in improving the 
community from within instead represent the 
problem.

“I think we really need to start with our 

school systems because that is one of the main 
reasons people who work downtown don’t 
live in the city,” Gonzalez said. “I think start-
ing with that would be a good way to attract 
people to move into the city and not just com-
mute in.”

For her, she said, Detroit is a city whose call 

is waiting to be answered — in a way that is 
more equitable and sustainable, extending its 
promise beyond the boundaries of a luxurious 
metropolitan epicenter.


I 

was told to take off my Star of David before traveling 
to Spain. Not because Spain is unsafe, necessarily, but 
because you just don’t know. It was a small detail on my 

extensive “To Do” list and the impact didn’t really hit me 
until I landed in Madrid, went to feel the points of the star 
for comfort and found it missing.

I’m not deeply religious. I’m more Jew*ish*, if you get 

what I’m saying. I don’t attend temple regularly and I’m def-
initely iffy on who or what presides over us. But I identify 
as a Jew. I identify because I would feel guilty if I didn’t, 
because being Jewish is what my family was. It’s in my heri-
tage, it’s what for centuries my ancestors fought to be. And 
I’ll be damned if I’m the one, in my cushy life in suburban 
America, to turn my back on the plight of my people.

I like to say I “chose” to be Jewish. We always celebrated 

Hanukkah in our house, and I always knew that my dad and 
mom, by blood, were Jewish. Passover was, and is, my favor-
ite holiday. But because neither of my parents felt strongly 
about a proper Hebrew school training, it was up to me to 
ask to join a temple. And we did, and I was Bat Mitzvah’d 
and so was my sister, and I even went through 12th grade at 
Temple Beth Haverim Shir Shalom.

In Spain, it is just an expectation that you are Catho-

lic. It’s not rude, it’s just the norm. 
Muslims are (typically) identified by 
their clothing choices and their lan-
guage, but reform Jews hide within 
plain sight in the folds of normal 
life. When I first met my host mom, 
Maria, she told me which churches 
I could attend if I needed to. I didn’t 
correct her. Not because I thought 
that she would have thought less of 
me, but because it didn’t bother me. 
So what? I was excited to go to a 
Mass in one of the ancient cathedrals 
one day; I was sure the slight dis-
comfort of not knowing what to do 
would be masked by my enjoyment 
in another culture.

Then time flew by, and being Jew-

ish never truly surfaced to the fore-
front of my experience in Spain. It’s 
not that I didn’t miss it, it’s just that 
I pushed it aside to make room for 
new experiences and new cultural 
boundaries. It wasn’t until an excur-
sion to Toledo halfway through the 
program that it hit me how much I 
missed my community.

After a day of looking at cathe-

drals and monasteries and a lunch at 
a decent restaurant, the tour guide took us to a synagogue. 
A sinagoga. We entered into the Jewish quarter, and on the 
ground there were three bronze plaques, all reading “The 
Jewish Quarter.” One each in Spanish, Hebrew and English. 
Like a Easter egg hunt, there were small markers of Meno-
rahs to identify which buildings and streets belonged to the 
quarter.

Toledo is known for a lot of things: its beauty, its metal-

working, El Greco, having existed since the Bronze Age. But 
it’s also known for the conservation of the Barrio del Judeos 
(Jewish neighborhood). It was a city with an even mixture 
of Muslims, Catholics and Jews, and the city represents, 
even today, that beautiful harmony. But, of course, despite 
the “tolerance” of the Jews, there were some measures 
taken to “identify” us.

A plaque read: “The clothes Jews wore were no different 

from their neighbors. However, there were laws imposed on 
them which required that they wear a little red wheel, a tar-
get, as a distinctive sign that they were Jews.”

Harmless. Jews occupied three sections of daily life. The 

most elite were translators, treasurers, trusted advisors to 
city officials. They were wealthy Sephardic Spaniards who 
garnered respect. The second tier was the merchants and 
the loaners, and the third was the artisans.

But they all had to wear a red wheel because they were 

different, because they prayed to one G-d and didn’t hold 
Jesus Christ in the same light as others. They were differ-
ent because they had stricter regulations on their food and 
clothing. They were different because intolerance of differ-
ing opinions and faiths was, and still is, rampant in society.

My Jewish identity in Spain was cemented with the tour 

of Toledo. I felt comfortable in the folds of my own com-
munity and it reaffirmed my decision to practice Judaism.

Visiting La Sinagoga del Transito was interesting and 

humbling. We had visited cathedral after cathedral, and by 
no means am I complaining about that. They were gorgeous 
and they represent the paramount strength of human intel-
lect in design. They are filled with a fantastic history and 

depict the wonder of the human will. But, at the same time, 
they are not mine to claim. They are there for me to visit, 
but not to feel at home. So when I visited the temple, I was 
delighted.

As I understand it — and don’t cite me as your main source 

— the temple is supposed to be bare of saints and depictions 
of G-d. There is no iconography and the windows are to be 
set high up (traditionally) for the fear that people will look 
in and see us praying. The Jewish people have adapted and 
recognized the tendency for hate, and thus wish for private 
prayer and opt for a more confined space by placing the win-
dows that high. Temples are typically not old. They don’t 
tend to last through the ages. That’s why Toledo was named 
as a Unesco World Heritage site (or part of it) because of 
their conservation of the temples and other religious monu-

ments.

So, I’ve never been in a temple that was more than about 

60 years old. And all of them that I’ve seen have been very 
plain with limited decoration. So when I walked (more 
like pushed my way inside past a wall of people who were 
inexplicably dawdling in the reception room) into this 
synagogue, I’m pretty sure I audibly gasped. It’s a differ-
ent experience than the tall vaults of a cathedral coupled 
with beautiful rose windows and precious artwork. The 
synagogue was plain as it was beautiful, as detailed as it 
was sparse, as empty as it was full. The absence of more was 
noticeable. The point of the building, unlike the explosion 
of meaning in a cathedral, was for prayer. It was for com-
munity.

So when I stood there, gazing up, it felt right. I felt in 

a home, I felt in the community. And it wasn’t until that 
moment that I realized I miss the community that I have at 
home. To stray a little more into the philosophical: People 
crave feeling like they belong. Everyone. Everyone, on some 
level, has a need to feel like they belong to something and to 
feel order and to feel like they occupy the same niche of the 
world with other people. For many of us, we all have different 
niches and different needs, but when we feel at home and at 

peace is when we find 
a space that makes us 
feel welcome. And I 
had many spaces like 
that in Spain, but I 
realized I had been 
missing my religious 
niche. I had been 
missing that connec-
tion with others, that 
same 
understanding 

of our background. 
And I’m not just talk-
ing about my temple 
community, 
because 

it’s not like I’m there 
all the time, but just 
being around others 
of the same faith. Half 
my friends are Jew-
ish, most of my family 
is Jewish and, more 
importantly, 
every-

body recognizes that 
I am Jewish. There 
was no recognition in 
Salamanca. And there 
wasn’t any malicious 
intent behind it; it is 

just what it is. But there, in Toledo, I felt that connection.

It was a small connection, but it meant so much.
I asked my friend to take a picture of me outside the walls 

of the temple. I said, “Can you take this picture of me for my 
Grandma?” As in, in my Jewish family my grandmother is 
the matriarch of my religious identity. As in, she is the rea-
son why I feel connected to my religion. As in, I feel beauti-
ful because I am in a space I connect with.

My Jewish identity abroad was by no means a struggle. 

I recognize my own privileges and know that I do not get 
to complain when I had this amazing chance to live and 
breathe Salamanca, Spain. But my Jewish identity is a 
constant in my life that I had been missing, and I felt like 
I needed to write a long-winded article about it. I needed 
to kvetch.

Finding My Jewish Roots Abroad

by Sylvanna Gross, Daily Sports Writer

ILLUSTRATION BY ELISE HAADSMA


I 

drink black coffee and therefore, I am a badass. 
It suggests that I have places to go, people to see 
and don’t have the time to fuss around with milk. 

It gives off the (vital) impression that I have my shit 
together.

My equilibrium is set at a healthy level of caffein-

ation at which I can then proceed to be a functional 
member of society. Which I am.

In my defense, I grew up next door to a coffee shop. 

Philz, a chain that sprouted within a grocery store in 
San Francisco, spread throughout the Bay Area and 
landed just across the street from me. In fact, it’s so 
close that my home Wi-Fi reaches the outside seating 
with a strong signal.

The Philz aesthetic can best be described as “grun-

gy granola.” The baristas are inked and pierced, ques-
tionable indie rock plays overhead, and the pastries 
are, of course, gluten-free. Back then I was into the 
doctored-up stuff, ordering my coffee sweet and 
creamy to hide the bitterness it inherently assumes. 
My friends and I hung out there after school and tried 
to study, but mostly just talked and dreamed of our 
futures. Philz was my fictional escape, my version of 
Central Perk or Luke’s Diner, the coffee shop where 
my splendid, teenage shenanigans ensued.

There I submitted my college essays and had inter-

views for schools I didn’t get into. I eavesdropped 
on some disastrous Match.com dates, which I vigor-
ously transcribed and will later develop into a comedy 
series called “How Not to Date.” A boy asked me to 
the school dance with a coffee and a note that said, 
“It would Phil(z) me up with joy if you went to prom 
with me.”

There was also the matter of the cute barista. He 

wore tiny black gauges that my parents would have 
hated and listened to The Growlers, a “psychedelic 
rock” band that I pretended to like because he did. 
His Instagram almost exclusively featured his (ille-
gal) graffiti art, and on his breaks he would sit with 
me and tell me about his sleepless night of artistic 
inspiration. I thought he was dreamy. He was dark 
and twisty in all the right ways, so we flirted and he 
gave me free drinks.

I’ve recorded those afternoons at Philz into perfect 

memories — the sunny California weather, the young 
people, the coffee. To be fair, the weather was perfect 
because the state was experiencing its worst drought 
in decades, but I didn’t care, because I was 16 and in 
my sweet, creamy bubble.

By the end of high school, I was having my coffee 

with a splash of cream and a teaspoon of sugar. I’d 
had my first taste of loss, failure and rejection. I’d also 
learned to steer clear of guys that are into psychedelic 
rock.

My freshman year at the University of Michigan 

came and went with all-nighters and morning classes. 
Naturally, my body craved the strong stuff. The end-
less reel of college life left no room for extras and so 
my equilibrium had to adjust. My year was fast, exhil-
arating and always caffeinated.

When I returned home for the summer, Philz 

seemed, at first, just as I’d left it (except for the curi-
ous disappearance of the cute barista). Lines of decaf-

feinated civilians wrapped around the door and the 
smell of roasting beans wafted through my bedroom 
window at 5:30 in the morning.

A year older and somewhat wiser, I returned to 

Philz and ordered a coffee that my freshman year of 

pseudo-adulting had inspired: no cream, no sugar.

It hit the spot, but this summer, spending time at 

Philz felt out of place. Sunny afternoons paralyzed me 
like unwelcomed memories from the past, ones that I 
couldn’t ever re-live, nor did I want to. I’m still young 

and naïve — I know — but I’ve also made a place for 
myself in a world that is bigger than what it was a 
year ago. I’m 19 and impatient. I want life go faster, 
to discover everything faster. Going backward feels so 
unnatural.

Maybe black coffee is just a placebo, an attempt to 

convince myself that I can handle the bitterness that 
real life is laced with. Because, as much as I don’t 
want to admit it, things have changed. The friends 
that I spent afternoons drinking coffee with, the ones 
I thought would be mine forever, have drifted into dif-
ferent directions. The fantasies I created from across 
the street of the house I grew up in — of internships 
I’d have and men I’d meet and places I’d live — seem 
less and less realistic. At least for right now. College 
has turned me into a bit more of a realist, less likely to 
fall into the traps of the romantic storylines I’d con-
coct in the safety of the little shop a minute away from 
home.

Maybe it’s OK to grow out of things and grow into 

new things and try to forget that some things hap-
pened all together.

I’m a little less sweet now and don’t need as much 

cream to dilute reality. But, as previously mentioned, 
I’m also kind of a badass. So I can take it.

convince myself that I can 
handle the bitterness that 

real life is laced with.”

Midway through my time studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa, I jumped at the chance to attend Afrikaburn, a Burning Man regional festival in the South African 
desert. Afrikaburn is a temporary society erected in the desert at the end of each April, where nothing is for sale and everyone is encouraged to give something: donating 

time to a camp that makes breakfast, creating temporary art structures, volunteering at a first aid tent. For my gift, I took portraits with my film camera.
