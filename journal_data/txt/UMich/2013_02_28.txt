Vereen said people - espe-

He cautioned that this behavior
primes the brain for addiction
if one self-medicates regularly,
and added that young people

are sometimes afraid to get help
because of the negative stigma
associated with addiction.
"Our society tends to focus

LEO: 'U' won't

in negotiation

KNOTS FOR MOTTS

Union official
addresses CSGto
rally support
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
How are the Lecturers'
Employee Organization's con-
tract negotiations going? It
depends who you ask.
On Tuesday night Sociology
lecturer Ian Robinson spoke at
the Central Student Government
assembly meeting encouraging
representatives to pass a resolu-
tion in support of the LEO as it
tries to finalize its contract with
the University on Friday.
Robinson - a member of
LEO's bargaining team - said
he attended the meeting in the
midst of faltering contract nego-
tiations between the University
and LEO, which represents about
1,500 lecturers at the three Uni-
versity of Michigan campuses.
The union's current contract
expires in April.
Robinson said LEO has made
increasing the salaries of lec-

turers the "centerpiece" of its
negotiations this year, but the
University has not been discuss-
ing the issue.
"At a certain point in the pro-
cess, about three weeks ago ...
(the University) basically said,
'Well, we're not interested in
talking any further about this,"'
he said after the meeting.
Raising lecturers' salaries is
an issue that LEO has dubbed
"equal pay for equal work," and
Robinson has authored a 57-page
report on the issue that argues
in part that tenure-track faculty,
like assistant professors, make
considerably more money than
lecturers teachingstudents.
"Basically they're saying ...
this is a straight market transac-
tion," Robinson said. "I just felt
that's unacceptable and so in that
sense, (negotiations are) going
very badly."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald, however, said nego-
tiations have been progressing,
and did not allude to any major
disagreements.
"The negotiations are continu-
ing. The bargaining teams have

On Tuesday night, in the

went down across campus.
Service returned at 4:52 a.m.

after about five hours.
During the outage, the
Internet was not connected
to the University server, mak-

from Merit Network, an Ann

"We've got all hands on
deck; we're trying to figure it

out," Merit CEO Donald Welch
said during the outage.
Welch was not immediately
able to determine the source
of the issue, but said Merit was
experiencing "a lot" of prob-
lems. He said the issue started
at around 11 p.m.

Michelle Obama on Wednesday
congratulated this Southern state
for a more than 13 percent drop in

example should inspire the rest of

It's the reason she made Mis-
sissippi the first stop on a two-
day tour to promote her signature
effort, the anti-childhood obe-
sity campaign she launched three
years ago called "Let's Move."
In remarks at an elementary
school near Jackson, the first lady
cited new research showing that
childhood obesity rates among
elementary school pupils in the
state had declined by 13.3 percent
between 2005 and 2011.
"What's happeninghere in Mis-

is all about," she told an audience
of state officials, school nutrition
professionals and parents. She
urged them to keep on doing what
they've been doing.

Algerian in 'Jihad

U.S. extradition
An Algerian man wanted by
U.S. authorities over the abortive
"Jihad Jane" plot to assassinate a
Swedish artist is expected to face
extradition hearings in an Irish
courthouse Wednesday after his
surprise arrest.
Ali Charaf Damache, 47, had
just walked free from court after
three years in an Irish prisonwhen
detectives acting on an American
extradition warrant rearrested
and escorted him, handcuffed,
to an unmarked police car. Court
officials said he was expected to
face U.S. extradition demands
Thursday in Dublin High Court.
The FBI and U.S. Justice
Department accuse Damache of
being the ringleader behind an
unrealized 2009 conspiracy to
target artist Lars Vilks in Sweden
over his series of drawings depict-
ing the Muslim prophet Muham-
mad as a dog. Muslim extremists
in Iraq had offered a $100,000

reward for anyone who killed
Vilks, who was never attacked.

day after he was killed by a large

ance swim.
Strange, 46, was an award-
winning television and short
film director and the father of a
2-year-old girl. He was swimming
near popular Muriwai Beach on
Wednesday when he was attacked
by the shark that was possibly 14
feet (4 meters) long.
Police attempting to save him
raced out in inflatable boats and
fired gunshots at the enormous
predator, which they say rolled
away and disappeared. They
couldn't confirm if they'd killed
it. Police were able to recover
Strange's body.

ALESSANDRA TARANTINO/AP
Pope Benedict XVI waves to pilgrims in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican Wednesday.
Pope addresses 150,000 in
address before resignation

Recalls joy,'
difficulties in
final audience
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope
Benedict XVI bid an emotional
farewell Wednesday on the
eve of his retirement, recalling
moments of "joy and light" dur-
ing his papacy, but also times of
difficulty when "it seemed like
the Lord was sleeping."
Some 150,000 people, many
waving banners proclaiming
"Grazie!" flooded St. Peter's
Square, eager to bear witness to
the final hours of a papacy that
will go down in history as the
first in 600 years to end in resig-
nation rather than death.
Benedict basked in the emo-
tional send-off, taking a long
victory lap around the square in
an open-sided car, and stopping
to kiss and bless half a dozen
babies. Seventy cardinals, some
tearful, sat in solemn attendance
- and gave him a standing ova-
tion at the end of his speech.
Benedict then made a quick
exit, forgoing the meet-and-
greet session that typically
follows his weekly general audi-
ence, as if to not prolong the
goodbye.
Given the weight of the
moment, Benedict also replaced
his usual Wednesday catechism
lesson with a heartfelt final
address, explaining once again
why he was retiring and assur-
ing his flock of 1.2 billion that he
was not abandoningthem.
"To love the church means
also to have the courage to take
difficult, painful decisions,
always keeping the good of the
church in mind, not oneself,"
Benedict said to thundering
applause.
He noted that a pontiff has no
privacy - neither as pope, nor
in his future role as emeritus
pope: "He belongs always and
forever to everyone, to the whole
church."
During his eight years as
pope, Benedict said he had had
"moments of joy and light, but
also moments that haven't been

easy. ... Moments of turbulent
seas and rough winds, as has
occurred in the history of the
church, when it seemed like the
Lord was sleeping."
But he said he never felt alone,
that God always guided him, and
he thanked his cardinals and
colleagues for their support and
for "understanding and respect-
ing this important decision."
The pope's tenure has been
beset by the clerical sex abuse
scandal, discord over everything
from priestly celibacy to wom-
en's ordination, and mostrecent-
ly the betrayal by his own butler,
who stole his private papers and
leaked them to a journalist.
Under a bright sun and blue
skies, the square was overflow-
ing with pilgrims and curiosity-
seekers. Those who couldn't get
in watched on giant TV screens
set up along the main boulevard
leading to the square. About
50,000 tickets were requested,
and in the end, the Vatican
estimated that 150,000 people
flocked to the farewell.
"It's difficult - the emo-
tion is so big," said Jan Marie, a
53-year-old Roman in his first
years as a seminarian. "We came
to support the pope's decision."
With chants of "Benedetto!"
the mood was far more buoy-
ant than during the pope's final
Sunday blessing. It recalled the
jubilant turnouts that often
accompanied him at World
Youth Days and events involv-
ing his predecessor, Pope John
Paul II.
Benedict has said he decided
to retire after realizing that, at
85, he simply didn't have the
"strength of mind or body" to
carry on.
"I have taken this step with
the full understanding of the
seriousness and also the nov-
elty of the decision, but with a
profound serenity in my soul,"
Benedict told the crowd.
He will meet Thursday morn-
ing with his cardinals for a final
time, then fly by helicopterto the
papal residence at Castel Gan-
dolfo south of Rome.
There, at 8 p.m., the doors of

the palazzo will close and the
Swiss Guards in attendance will
go off duty, their service pro-
tecting the head of the Catholic
Church over - for now.
Many of the cardinals who
will choose Benedict's successor
were in St. Peter's Square for his
final audience. Among them was
retired Los Angeles Cardinal
Roger Mahony, the object of a
grass-roots campaign in the U.S.
to persuade him to recuse him-
self for having covered up for
sexually abusive priests. Maho-
ny has said he will be among the
115 cardinals voting for the next
pope.
"God bless you," Mahony said
when asked by television crews
about the U.S. campaign.
Also in attendance were car-
dinals over 80, who can'tpartici-
pate in the conclave but will take
part in meetings next week to
discuss the problems facing the
church and the qualities needed
in a new pope.
"I am joining the entire
church in praying that the car-
dinal electors will have the help
of the Holy Spirit," 82-year-old
Spanish Cardinal Julian Her-
ranz said.
Herranz has been authorized
by the pope to brief voting-age
cardinals on his investigation
into the leaks of papal docu-
ments that exposed corruption
in the Vatican administration.
Vatican officials say cardinals
will begin meeting Monday to
decide when to set the date for
the conclave.
Still, the rank-and-file faith-
ful weren't so concerned with
the future: They wanted to savor
the final moments of a pope they
have known for years.
"I came to thank him for the
testimony that he has given the
church," said Maria Cristina
Chiarini, a 52-year-old home-
maker who traveled by train
from Lugo in central Italy with
about 60 members of her par-
ish. "There's nostalgia, human
nostalgia, but also comfort.
Because as Christians we have
hope. The Lord won't leave us
without a guide."

Iran hails
concessions as a
'turning point'
ALMATY, Kazakhstan (AP)
- World powers offered broader
concessions than ever to Iran
in attempts Wednesday to keep
alive diplomatic channels that
seek to rein in the Islamic Repub-
lic's nuclear program and pre-
vent it from building an atomic
weapon.
The offer was hailed by Saeed
Jalili, Iran's top official at diplo-
matic talks in Kazakhstan, who
said it represented a "turning
point" by world powers to com-
promise on Tehran's uranium
enrichment program after years
of delicate negotiationsthat near-
ly dissolved last June.
The proposal allows Iran to
keep a limited amount of highly
enriched uranium - but not
make any more - stops short of
demanding the full shutdown of
an underground nuclear facility,
and offers to remove some trade
sanctions that have hurt Iran's
economy.
Still, a senior U.S. official said,
crippling sanctions on Iran's oil
and financial industries would
remain in place as negotiations
continue. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity to discuss
the sensitive talks more candidly.
The latest offer marked a small
but significant shift from ear-
lier, harder-line proposals that
prompted Iran to dig in its heels
amid fears that an arms race in
neighboring states could sow yet
more instability in the already
turbulent Mideast. Israel has
repeatedly hinted its readiness to
strike Iranian nuclear facilities
- a military venture the United
States likely would be dragged
into.
The new offer also is expected
to force Iran to respond with a
reasonable plan of its own - or be
seen as a recalcitrant negotiator
unwilling to compromise.
The proposal "was more real-
istic than before and had tried
to get closer to the Iranian view-
point in some cases," Jalili told
reporters at the end of two days
of negotiations in Kazakhstan's
largest city, Almaty. "We consid-
er this positive - although there
is a long distance to reach the
suitable point."
British Foreign Minister Wil-
liam Hague called the talks "use-
ful" and said the new proposal
aimed "to build confidence on

both sides and move negotiations
forward."
"Ilook forward to further prog-
ress," Hague said in a statement.
Iran maintains it has the right
under international law to enrich
uranium to 20 percent -" a level
that can quickly be elevated into
use for nuclear warheads. Teh-
ran claims it needs that level of
enriched uranium for reactor
fuel and medical isotopes, and
has signaled it does not intend to
stop. U.N. nuclear inspectors last
week confirmed Iran has begun
a major upgrade of its program
at the country's main uranium
enrichment site.
Iran also insists, as a starting
point, that world powers must
recognize the republic's right
to enrich uranium, and Jalili
repeated Wednesday that Teh-
ran must be able to enrich to 20
percent.
"Whatever we need, we will of
course pursue that - whether it
is 5 percent or 20 percent," Jalili
said. "It is important to us to have
the 20 percent."
However, that remains a red
line to negotiators from the world
powers - the United States,
China, Russia, Britain, France
and Germany - who put their
continued demand that Iran end
any uranium enrichment that
nears or reaches 20 percent at the
heart of the new offer.
The senior U.S. official said
Iran would be required to restrict
its current stockpile of 20 percent
enriched uranium but, in a new
development, would be allowed
to keep enough to fuel a research
reactor in Tehran. Also, Iran
would have to suspend opera-
tions at its underground nuclear
facility at Fordo - and make it
difficult to restart it quickly -
but would no longer be required
to fully shut it down.
In return, the official said, the
U.S. and EU would lift a number
of unspecified sanctions on Iran,
which was hit with harsh trade
restrictions last year in Western
hopes they would force Tehran
to bend on its nuclear program.
Additionally, the U.N. Secu-
rity Council and the EU would
impose no new nuclear sanctions
against Iran.
However, the hardest-hitting
sanctions - on Iran's oil and finan-
cial industries - will remain in
place during the negotiations, the
official said. The tough sanctions
have caused unemployment and
inflation in Iran to skyrocket, while
depressing its daily oil output and
value of its currency, the rial.

Changes lead to
fourth straight
quarterly loss
NEW YORK (AP) - Boy, it
just wasn't J.C. Penney's year.
The mid-priced department
store chain reported another
much larger-than-expected loss
in the fiscal fourth quarter on a
nearly 30 percent plunge in rev-
enue in the latest sign shoppers
aren't happy with the changes
it's made in the past year.
The results mark a full year
of massive quarterly losses and
revenue declines that miss Wall
Street estimates since J.C. Pen-
ney Co. began a turnaround
strategy that included ditching
most of its coupons and sales
events in favor of everyday
low prices, bringing in hipper
designer brands such as Betsy
Johnson and remaking outdat-
ed stores.
The quarterly performance
puts additional pressure on
CEO Ron Johnson, the former
Apple Inc. executive who was
brought about a year ago to turn

the stodgy retailer that was los-
ing money into a hip and profit-
able company that can compete
with the likes of Macy's or
H&M. In the past year since
Johnson rolled out his plan,
though, even once loyal custom-
ers have strayed away from the
1,100-store chain.
While acknowledging that
Penney made some mistakes
during a conference call with
investors, Johnson said on
Wednesday that Penney will
start offering more sales in
stores - about 100 of the 600
or so the chain offered prior to
the turnaround plan. That's in
addition to the sales events that
the company said last month
that it would start offering dur-
ing holidays and other key sales
periods throughout the year.
"Experience is making mis-
takes and learning from them,
and I have learned a lot," John-
son said. "We worked really
hard and tried many things to
help the customer understand
that she shop any time on her
terms. But we learned she pre-
fers a sale. At times, she loves a
coupon. And she always needs a

reference price."
Teresa Cansell agrees. She
used to make the 45-mile trek
from her farm near Leon, Kan.,
to a Penney store in Wichita
about once a month. But since
Penney started making changes
last year, she's only been twice.
And on her latest trip in Decem-
ber, shewalked outemptyhand-
ed because she couldn't find a
leather jacket she wanted.
"I loved the old J.C. Penney.
I liked the coupons," Cansell,
53, said. "I used to go to Pen-
ney every time I got them in the
mail. I would buy a ton of stuff."
Penney's results show that
other shoppers feel the same
way. During the fourth quar-
ter that ended Feb. 2, Penney's
revenue at stores opened at
least a year - a figure the retail
industry uses to measure of a
store's health - dropped 31.7
percent.
That's on top of hefty drops
in the previous three quarters
of 26.1 percent in the third, 21.7
percent inthe second and 19 per-
cent in the first. And it's steeper
than the decline of 26.1 percent
Wall Street had expected.

Own up to reality
University policies must accept severity of sexual assault
n Feb. 25, University of North Carolina sophomore Landen
Gambill received an e-mail from the school's graduate stu-
dent attorney general. The e-mail said the school was charg-
ing her with an honor code violation for "disruptive or intimidating
behavior." Gambill is part of a group of 68 UNC students filing a com-
plaint with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights
alleging that the school failed to protect their rights as survivors of
sexual assault. This week, she received the e-mail after she talked
publicly on campus about her own experience with rape. While the
university maintains that the violation wasn't in retaliation to the
complaint, the application of the honor code in this case sends the
wrong message. Universities must own up to the realities of sexual
assault on college campuses, and discouraging students from speak-
ing out will only serve to silence rape survivors.

n the constant tug-of-war for
state funding, the University
has historically been on the
losing end. In
2011, Michigan
Gov. Snyder and
the state legisla-
ture savagely cut
state appropria-
tions to higher
education by 15
percent. See- KEVIN
ing the error of MERSOL-
their ways - or BARG
more likely, an
electoral oppor-
tunity - they
raised fundinby 3 percent in 2012.
And, once again, the oh-so-generous
governor cut public universities
some slack and proposed a 2-percent
increase this year.
With state appropriations on the
rise, everything must be peachy
keen, right? Wrong.
University President Mary Sue
Colemanwas righttounderscorethis
point on Tuesday. Speaking before
the House Appropriations on Higher
Education Subcommittee, she urged
legislators to invest in Michigan's
publichighereducation as ameans to
fuel the state economy. She said this
last year, and years before that. Yet,
more often than not, these words fall
on deaf ears.
Ultimately, a 2-percent increase
this year won't remotely offset the
35-percent cut in appropriations
over the past decade. Coleman
and other higher education lead-
ers around the state recognize that
the state legislature has abandoned
public universities; the governor
has forsaken his alma mater. And
the students, saddled with tens of
thousands of dollars in debt, feel
this reality bearing down upon
them every day.
Now that the University knows it's
effectively on its own, it must reflect
on how to increase revenues in the
absence of state funding. To their
credit, Coleman and her adminis-
tration have been mulling this over
for some time. And from what I can
tell, they're focusing on two sources
of revenue: out-of-state students and
corporations. Both have pitfalls.
Last May, Coleman asserted that

the University, among others in the
state, is "underperforming in terms
of our out-of-state student popula-
tion." By what measure is the Uni-
versity underperforming?
This semester, Winter 2013, 51.7
percent of the student body is in-
state - about 21,200 students. And
about 19,800 students - 48.3 percent
- constitute the non-resident part
of the student body. Already almost
half of students on campus are from
outside of Michigan.
In addition, more out-of-state stu-
dents enroll per year as compared to
in-state students than ever before.
By my measure, it seems like the
University has this "performance"
issue covered.
But President Coleman sees it a dif-
ferent way. In a recent article in The
Michigan Daily, Coleman stressed
that greater numbers of out-of-state
students "come paying full freight ...
(and) add tremendously to the econo-
my of the state of Michigan."
In other words, the University
best performs when more of its stu-
dents pay higher tuition rates. True,
this does generate greater revenue
- but at what cost? Among other
costs, the expressed mission of the
University: "to serve the people of
Michigan."
Coleman, identifying this short-
coming wisely, has sought to address
it by arguing that out-of-state stu-
dents will stay and invest in Michi-
gan post-graduation. While this may
be the case elsewhere, what proof is
there to support this in Michigan,
a state grappling with grave unem-
ployment? Until she presents solid
evidence, I'm calling this what it
is - a ploy to generate revenue that
exploits out-of-state students and
fails to meet the University's com-
mitment to the state.
The University is working to
address the employment issue
through partnering with corpora-
tions, which serve as another poten-
tial source of revenue.
On Monday, Coleman spoke to
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs about partnering
with Business Leaders for Michigan.
BLM serves as a roundtable of prom-
inent leaders frombusiness and pub-
lic universities in Michigan. In part,

it works to partner industry and uni-
versities in research initiatives and
fundraising efforts.
Raising revenue
doesn't have to
compromise
our values.

At the SACUA meeting, Phil
Hanlon, University provost and
executive vice president for aca-
demic affairs, identified corporate
partnerships, such as those through
the BLM, as key in "boosting the
University's financial base" and by
extension, bolstering the Michigan
economy. The thrust of the effort
promotes education in the fields of
science, technology, engineering,
math and entrepreneurism. Almost
as a footnote, Coleman assured
faculty members that the efforts
would incorporate broader fields,
like liberal arts.
This approach stands to increase
opportunities for students and offset
cuts to state appropriations. How-
ever, I'm concerned that efforts such
as this, and Coleman's other initia-
tives around entrepreneurism, fail
to engage students from all corners
of campus in a meaningful way. Plus,
the added influence of corporate
interest must be heavily monitored
to make sure we're not compromis-
ing the University's goals for a boost
in revenue.
The University understands its
situation. Its game of tug-of-war
with the state nears futile. Instead,
Coleman and her administration
have proactively sought out alter-
native revenue sources. Now they
need to address some serious issues
with these alternatives. Although
there's no perfect solution to the rev-
enue problem, the University should
continue to strive towards a better
solution - one that aligns with the
University's mission.

According to the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice, fewer than 5 percent of rapes involving
college women are reported to law enforce-
ment. The complaint filed to the OCR alleges
that even when incidents were reported to
campus authorities, the school fell flat assist-
ing students afterward. Andrea Pino, a UNC
junior who joined in the complaint, said the
Academic Advising Office at UNC told her she
was "being lazy" when she was having trouble
going to classes after a sexual assault incident.
While UNC does have a program intended to
help survivors, it's critical that the univer-
sity ask appropriate questions when talking to
students about rape. Furthermore, the com-
plaint makes it clear that the university should
widen its understanding of rape. Dismissing
an assault because it happened between a cou-
ple, as alleged in the complaint, displays both
an incredibly narrow grasp on the realities of
sexual assault.
Unfortunately, stories like Gambill's are
becoming increasingly common. In October,
Angie Epifano, a former student at Amherst
College, claimed the school was unsympathet-
ic after her own struggle with sexual assault.
Epifano argued the college's officials treated
her as a problem, rather than a survivor, which
compelled her to leave the school.

In response to Epifano's article, Amherst's
president Carolyn Martin hosted a campus-
wide talk about sexual assault. While this
dialogue is a start, Amherst still hasn't rec-
tified its sexual assault policy. According to
an article from Jezebel, students who com-
mit sexual assault usually receive a two- to
four-semester suspension as their punish-
ment, while students caught stealing a laptop
receive five semesters of suspension. While
discussion is a critical first step, the conversa-
tion must lead to changes in how universities
handle sexual assault.
Members of the University community must
look internally and question how our own col-
lege handles sexual assault and survivor sup-
port. Through the Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center and Counseling and
Psychological Services, students can receive
support after assaults. But, in order to get stu-
dents to take advantage of these resources, we
must ensure that survivors feel safe talking
about attacks. "I Will," a recently launched
student-led campaign, encourages the campus
to discuss sexual assault.
It's absolutely crucial that this conversation
continues does not end with the academic year.
Through regular discussion and reexamina-
tion of policies, that reality can change.

SAMIA AYYASH 1
Humanizing the inhumane

PATRICK SIER I
Meet the real Detroit

Sometimes, if a half-truth is repeated
enough, we start to think of it as fact. Look
at any recent national news story about the
city of Detroit and you'll learn plenty about
its problems.
It's the same narratives over and over:
The old leadership was corrupt and the new
leadership is ineffective. The population has
gone down while crime has gone up. The city
is bleeding money and state takeover of the
municipal government seems imminent. The
buildings are burned out and uninhabitable.
I am on the planning team for the Detroit
Partnership. For us, most of the media cov-
erage of Detroit has only focused on what's
missing. Of course, understanding the city's
problems is important. But it's not the whole
story. I think it's about time we focus on what
Detroit does have - inspiring people willing
to work for change.
People like Riet Schumack, an activist and
community leader who moved from a com-
fortable Rosedale Park neighborhood to the
more disadvantaged Brightmoor neighbor-
hood. Since moving, she's worked to empow-
er the community through urban agriculture,
public art and blight reduction.
People like Chazz Miller, an artist who
works with the organization Artist Village,
using the creative arts not only to beautify
the city on the outside, but also to strengthen
its people on the inside. He runs art work-
shops for the thousands of Detroit students
who have lost art programs in their schools
due to budget cuts.
People like Yusef Shakur, a former gang
leader incarcerated for nine years who turned
his life around empowering disadvantaged
youth. As an author and community activist,
he takes his story of redemption to others.
These are only a few Detroiters among the
many that work tirelessly for the day they can
see their city back on its feet.
Detroit is a city with a history of both tri-
umph and struggle and an increasing divide
with its suburbs. Built by the auto industry,
Detroit is now fueled by an entrepreneurial

spirit. Detroit is a city that's motto translates
to "We hope for better things. It will arise
from the ashes."
This motto originally referred to the fire
of 1805 and the city's subsequent reconstruc-
tion. But today, the ashes we see come from a
very different place. Today we see a beautiful
city marred by the forces of racism and dein-
dustrialization. We hope for better things.
One day cannot fix a city. But ifa fire can
destroy a city in one day, maybe Detroit Part-
nership Day can spark a fire to bring it back.
Detroit needs people who burn with hope for
the future and passion for the present. People
who will be advocates when the usual jokes
get batted around. People who'll choose to
live in the city even when they're considered
crazy for doing so.
I hope you'll challenge yourself to look
beyond an occasionally rough exterior to see
what so many have cherished about this city.
Detroit has become more than just a place to
live, it has become a community. Every year,
we hear stories of community members see-
ing the work on Detroit Partnership Day and
asking what they can do to help. Interactions
like these make our work worth doing.
On March 23, be one of 1,400 Michigan stu-
dents working alongside proud Detroiters for
the betterment of the city. Work on projects
ranging from urban gardening with Neigh-
bors Building Brightmoor and the Michigan
Urban Farming Initiative to painting murals
in Artist Village.
Know that, whether you're holding a paint-
brush, a trowel or a sledgehammer, the real
change is being made in the interactions you
have with the community. Bridging the gap
between Ann Arbor and Detroit through
these connections is what service learning
and social justice are all about. Be a part of
that. See the city and gain new perspective.
Meet Detroit. Detroit Partnership Dayisjust a
beginning. Sign up to volunteer - on your own
or as a part ofa student group - at thedp.org.

Last week, StandWithUS and
I-LEAD brought two Israel Defense
Forces soldiers to campus with the
goal of humanizingthe IDF because
they felt that the "media presented
a skewed portrait of them." How
did the soldiers attempt to do this?
By dehumanizing the Palestinian
narrative - its culture, politics and
people. The discourse used during
the event didn't simply cater to a
specific audience; it was grossly
offensive and inaccurate.
From the beginning of their pre-
sentation, the soldiers, Lital and Ari,
repeatedly used the term "terror-
ist" to refer to the Palestinian civil-
ian population as a whole. I kept a
tally of how many times the soldiers
referred to Palestinians as terrorists.
Five minutes into the event, my count
reached 21.
Lital, a female IDF soldier,
attempted to gain sympathy points
with the crowd by discussing the
fear she feels partying in Tel Aviv.
According to Lital, clubbing in Tel
Aviv is risky business because Pales-
tinians could strike at any time with
their homemade rockets.
While Lital is entitled to her feel-
ings, the facts on the ground tell a
much different story. It's not Lital or
her friends that must fear Palestin-
ians; it's the 1.7 million people in the
Gaza Strip that must fear Israel. Not
one rocket that has ever landed in Tel
Aviv has caused a civilian death. And
the recent escalation of violence in
November was the first time a rocket
from Gazaevenremotely approached
the urban hotspot. Because the audi-
ence was looking only to praise the
IDF for ridding Israel from "terror-
ists," of course they were unable to
recognize the plight of the Palestin-
ian civilian. While Lital chooses her
wardrobe for a night out, Palestinian
children drown in sewage ponds due
to faulty or non-existent sewage net-
works that cannot be maintained due
to the Israeli blockade. When was the
last time an Israeli died from drown-
ing in sewage? While the soldiers
asked the audience to feel sympathy

for their plight, Israeli air strikes
wiped out three generations of a Pal-
estinian family.
The soldiers' claims about Hamas
were also totally false and baseless,
further reflecting both their igno-
rance and prejudice. They cited
Hamas, deemed a terrorist organi-
zation by the U.S. government, as
justification for continued occupa-
tion and obstacles to peace, specifi-
cally referencing the recent conflict
in November.
What they didn't acknowledge
was Israel's role in the strategic
assassination of Ahmad Jabari,
a chief negotiating partner for a
finalized truce with Israel. A video
of sheer propaganda was shown
regarding Hamas and its leaders in
Gaza. Produced by the Middle East
Media Research Institute, an orga-
nization founded by a former Israeli
intelligence officer, it has often been
criticized for its faulty translations
and is known for its cherry-picking
of extreme viewpoints to represent
the general nature of Arab media.
Additionally, why was there no men-
tion of the open-air prison in which
the population of Gaza lives? To por-
tray Hamas against Israel as a con-
flict fought on a level playing field
is far from accurate. Unfortunately,
the students sitting in that room
will never see the implications of the
blockade on the Gaza strip: the pov-
erty, hunger, dire living conditions
and failing infrastructure. The only
social services the people of Gaza
will ever know come from Hamas,
the democratically elected govern-
ing party.
When I asked about the implica-
tionsofPalestine-nowanobserving
member state in the United N'ations
- taking Israel to the International
Criminal Court to prosecute crimes
committed against Palestinians, Lit-
al's exact words were, "I don't want
to comment on that." Ari followed
suit, as they both assured there was
no validity in such a claim against
the most "moral" army in the world,
disregarding their own words earlier

in the evening as they relayed stories
of Palestinian terrorists. Early on in
her presentation, Lital told a story
of a Palestinian "terrorist" who was
nine months pregnant, in an ambu-
lance and in dire need of a hospital
as she was trying to cross a check-
point. Explosives were discovered
in the ambulance. Lital used this to
characterize the general nature of
Palestinians and ended the story.
After raising the question regarding
the ICC and hearing the responses
of Lital and Ari, I asked about the
fate of that woman in the ambu-
lance - did she make it to the hos-
pital? No, she didn't make it to the
hospital because Lital and her fellow
IDF soldiers at the checkpoint were
forced to shoot out the tires, and the
ambulance subsequently exploded.
She didn't comment further, and the
event ended.
If the purpose of the event was to
humanize the IDF, that feat wasn't
accomplished. Rather, an entire pop-
ulation was dehumanized in order to
justify crimes against an unarmed,
civilian, indigenous population.
Praised for their support of a two-
state solution, Ari and Lital are blind
to the implications this will have for
institutionalizing racial segregation
and the persistence of conflict in
the region. While young girls in Tel
Aviv fear spending their leisure time
at clubs, young Palestinian children
cannot walk to school without being
chased by IDF soldiers. Palestinians
are denied water rights; their houses
are demolished - they cannot even
move within their own lands.
Events like these held on our
campus make us all, as University
students, complacent in Israel's eth-
nic cleansing of the Palestinians.
They rationalize the status quo,
which endangers any hope of a
peaceful future for the Israeli and
Palestinian people. I made all of
the comments during and after the
event last week, but, per usual, the
voice of a Palestinian was silenced.

ed parties in September 2012,
said when they awoke, they were
being sexually assaulted. In the
most recent case, the student
reported that the suspect inap-
propriately grabbed her.
University Police spokeswom-
an Diane Brown said the crime
alert was sent out after the stu-
dent in the Feb. 15 case agreed
to file a report with the Ann
Arbor Police Department, which
has jurisdiction over the case
because it occurred off campus.
The student had initially report-
ed the assault to a University
employee, but did not want to file

a police report.
The suspect has been identi-
fied as a 31-year-old Asian male
with short black hair and brown
eyes. He is between 5'6" and
S'7" tall and weighs 140 pounds.
According to the description, he
looks younger than his actual
age.
The two other students have
not filed a report with AAPD, but
they did report the assaults to
University employees.
Brown said Ann Arbor Police
have made initial contact with
the suspect, but he has not been
arrested at this point in the
investigation.
LSA senior Guanheng Wu, a
resident of the seventh floor, said
the reported apartment hosts

parties regularly.
Wu's roommate, LSA senior
Brian Cutler, doesn't know any
of the residents of the reported
apartment, adding that people on
the floor generally keep to them-
selves.
LSA junior Brian Kulick,
another resident of the seventh
floor said he was surprised an
incident like this could occur
in his apartment building, but
added people should be careful
at parties regardless of the par-
ty's location.
"Everyone should take away
that we need to keep an eye out
for each other at parties," Kulick
said.
LSA and Kinesiology junior
Mallory Campbell, an eighth-

floor resident of Zaragon Place
said she believes building man-
agement should evict the suspect
in order to ensure the safety of
the buildings residents.
"It's pretty scary to think that
someone living in my apartment
is sexually assaulting people,"
Campbell said. "It's a little bit
scary to think that I could be on
an elevator with him."

SELF-CARE

with him that can keep him from
needing to ever have to use drugs
again?"' he continues. "(People
believe) once an addict, always
an addict."
Trish Meyer, program direc-
tor for outreach and education at
the Depression Center, said other
events during the conference
focused specifically on actions
students could take to cope with
depression.

"The closing panel was about
the new online tools that stu-
dents can use for their self-care
that incorporate strategies from
cognitive behavioral therapy,"
Meyer said. "These are sort of
coping skills that students can
use to help manage depression or
even to just manage your every-
day stress rather than just clini-
cal depression or anxiety."
Meyer said the conference
provided a unique opportu-
nity for the department and 21
University schools and depart-
ments to work together to raise

awareness about self-care. She
believes the support from the
community shows a Universi-
ty-wide understanding of the
prominence of depression on
college campuses.
"The reason (the schools and
departments donated money)
was so that we could offer free
registration to all students,"
Meyer said. "I think it's really a
testament to the University of

proved useful for mental health

"It's really good every time,"
Smith said. "We are already

that we're doing what we should

Fitzgerald stressed that the

"It's our approach that it's
important that negotiations take
place at the bargaining table,"
Fitzgerald said.-"It's really impor-
tant that we honor that process

ers."
Cordray and Secretary of Edu-
cation Arne Duncan submitted a
report to Congress last July that
showed there are more than $8
billion in defaulted private stu-
dent loan balances. The report

mered out at least two weeks
before the new restrictions on
unions take effect in Michigan on
March 25 because members must
wait two weeks to vote on a con-
tract.
A resolution proposed Tuesday
night in support of "equal pay for
equal work" was stalled on the
floor of the CSG assembly and
won't be voted on until at least
March 12 - the next time the
assembly meets.
Resolutions require two reads
before they can be passed. The
second read of a resolution is held
at a later meeting, and a motion
that the resolution be put on its
second read that same meeting
- which requires two-thirds sup-
port of the assembly - did not
pass.

Robinson said he felt the
administration held the opinion
of CSG in high esteem and having
the support of the assembly could
only have helped LEO's cause.
"Central Student Government,
as the representative body of U
of M students, could have spo-
ken with some authority about
how students feel so, I think
that would have influenced the
administration," he said.
He added that had he known
the procedures of CSG, he would
have submitted the resolution
earlier.
Rackham representative Pat-
rick O'Mahen, a member of the
Graduate Employees' Organiza-
tion, was frustrated by the delay.
While he noted that just because
students voted against a second

read, that didn't mean that the
assembly did not support the
resolution. Still, he noted that the
time-sensitive nature of the reso-
lution would have made a vote
worthwhile.
The resolution drew a fair
amount of discussion from the
assembly and multiple represen-
tatives said they weren't comfort-
able voting on a resolution they
had just read.
Still, even CSG President Man-
ish Parikh - despite not having a
vote in the assembly - weighed
in on the issue, arguing that a
second read should be held. He
said he trusted the judgment of
O'Mahen and Rackham repre-
sentative Ben Alterman - two of
the most vocal proponents of the
resolution.

Rob Belinski, a representative

firmed Tuesday that students

access CTools, umich.edu and
Wolverine Access because they

intranet, which is powered by
local servers. However, any non-

cessible.
Although University e-mail
could be accessed, it appeared
that no mail could be sent or
received.

Downing said the problem
only affected a small percent-
age of people served by Merit
Network, as the malfunction
occurred after normal busi-
ness hours. Merit engineers are
reviewing the incident further to
determine if itwas a hardware or
software malfunction at the core
router.
LSA sophomore Jeffrey Butler
said he had three midterms com-
ing up this week and was "livid"
when he lost access to his cours-
es' resources on the CTools web-
site Tuesday night. He said he
usually studies late at night and
the Internet malfunction was

"extremely inconvenient."
"I got through it, but it
unnerved me a lot," Butler said.
LSA freshman Ryne Menhen-
nick said being unable to access
CTools was an issue for him the
night before he had an exam. He
said he solved the complication
by going to the Union and using
site computers to print materials.
"It made studying for mid-
terms difficult ... I was pretty
stressed out," Menhennick said.

also noted that because private
loan repayment options are less
flexible than federal ones, bor-
rowers are having a more difficult
time paying these loans off.
The CFPB says it's beginning
to gather information on the stu-
dent loan burdens, the options
available for students to lower
monthly loan payments, exam-
ples of alternative payment pro-
grams in other markets and "the
most effective mechanisms for
communicating with distressed
borrowers."
Pam Fowler, the executive

director of the University's
Office of Financial Aid, said in an
e-mail interview that the CFPB's
intentions are identical to that of
the Pay As You Earn program,
but stressed that both programs
are extremely important for the
many students that have taken
out loans.
"There is so much informa-
tion out there about college, the
cost of college and student debt,
that it would make most students
think twice or three times about
going to college at all-and that
would be the true tragedy here,"

Fowler wrote.
Fowler said effective commu-
nication with borrowers is essen-
tial for successfulloan repayment,
and the source of such a message
is especially critical.
"If (the message) comes from
the government, I fear students
ho are in trouble will think it
is not a helpful message but
a punitive one and ignore it,"
Fowler said. "The message has
to come from someone viewed
as non-threatening by the stu-
dent and I doubt that is the gov-
ernment."

Emerson College's
Phi Alpha Tau
to pay for gender
change procedure
BOSTON (AP) - A college
fraternity in Boston has raised
more than twice the money
needed to pay for a new pledge's
gender transition surgery.
The Phi Alpha Tau frater-
nity at Emerson College began
raising money for sophomore
Donnie Collins early this
month after his insurance com-
pany wouldn't cover his breast
removal surgery. Their initial
goal was $4,800, but dona-
tions had exceeded $17,000 by
Wednesday afternoon, more
than double the procedure's

$8,000 price.
In a note posted this week
with a thank-you video on You-
Tube, Collins said the surgery
with a Springfield plastic sur-
geon would be scheduled this
week.
"I don't even know what to
say because the words 'thank
you' don't do it anymore," Col-
lins, 20, said on the video.
"I know that for me, person-
ally, feeling guilty and feeling
like, 'Am I worth all this?' has
been huge theme of my exis-
tence in general," he said. "You
just have to let it go because if
people want to help, you have to
let them help you."
Extra money donated in the
ongoing campaign will go to a
group that gives grants for sim-
ilar surgeries for transgender
people.

Van Cliburn, pianist and Cold
War hero, dies at 78 of cancer

Humanitarian and
renowned musician
from Texas
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -
For a time in Cold War America,
Van Cliburn had all the trappings
of a rock star: sold-out concerts,
adoring, out-of-control fans and a
name recognized worldwide. He
even got a ticker-tape parade in
New York City.
And he did it all with only a
piano and some Tchaikovsky
concertos.
The celebrated pianist played
for every American president
since Harry Truman, plus royal-
ty and heads of state around the
world. Buthe is best remembered
for winning a 1958 piano com-
petition in Moscow that helped
thaw the icy rivalry between
the United States and the Soviet
Union.
Cliburn, who died Wednesday
at 78 after fighting bone cancer,
was "a great humanitarian and
a brilliant musician whose light
will continue to shine through
his extraordinary legacy," said
his publicist and longtime friend
Mary Lou Falcone. "He will be
missed by all who knew and
admired him, and by countless
people he never met."
The young man from the small
east Texas town of Kilgore was
a baby-faced 23-year-old when
he won the first International
Tchaikovsky Competition in
Moscow just six months after
the Soviets' launch of Sputnik
embarrassed the U.S. and inau-
gurated the space race.
Cliburn returned to a hero's
welcome and the ticker-tape
parade - the first ever for a clas-
sical musician. A Time maga-
zine cover proclaimed him "The
Texan Who Conquered Russia."
The win also showed the
power of the arts, creating unity
despite the tension between the
superpowers. Music-loving Sovi-
ets clamored to see him perform.
Premier Nikita Khrushchev
reportedly gave the go-ahead for
the judges to honor a foreigner:
"Is Cliburn the best? Then give
him first prize."
In the years that followed, Cli-
burn's popularity soared. He sold

out concerts and caused riots
when he was spotted in public.
His fame even prompted an Elvis
Presley fan club to change its
name to his. His recording of the
Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No.
1 with Russian conductor Kirill
Kondrashin became the first
classical album to reach platinum
status.
Time magazine's 1958 cover
story quoted a friend as saying
Cliburn could become "the first
man in history to be a Horowitz,
Liberace and Presley all rolled
into one."
Russian pianist Denis Mat-
suev, who won the Tchaikovsky
competition in 1998 at the age of
23, the same age as Cliburn, said
Cliburn's "romantic style cap-
tured the hearts of Soviet audi-
ence."
"Everyone was in love with
him," Matsuev said. "And he
loved the Soviet Union, Russia
and the Russian public."
Matsuev, who knew Cliburn
personally, described him as an
"incredibly delicate, kind and
gentle man who dedicated his
entire life to art."
He also used his skill and fame
to help other young musicians
through the Van Cliburn Inter-
national Music Competition,
held every four years. Created
in 1962 by a group of Fort Worth
teachers and citizens, it remains
among the top showcases for the
world's best pianists.
"Since we know that classical
music is timeless and everlasting,
it is precisely the eternal verities
inherent in classical music that
remain a spiritual beacon for
people all over the world," Cli-
burn once said.
President George W. Bush pre-
sented Cliburn with the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom - the
nation's highest civilian honor
- in 2003. The following year,
he received the Order of Friend-
ship of the Russian Federation
from Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
"I still have lots of friends in
Russia," Cliburn said at the time.
"It's always a great pleasure to
talk to older people in Russia, to
hear their anecdotes."
After the death of his father
in 1974, Cliburn announced he
would soon retire to spend more

time with his ailing mother. He
stopped touring in 1978.
Among other things, tour-
ing robbed him of the chance to
enjoy opera and other musical
performances.
"I said to myself, 'Life is too
short.' I was missing so much,"
he told The New York Times in
2008. After winning the com-
petition, "it was thrilling to be
wanted. But it was pressure,
too."
Cliburn emerged from his
sabbatical in 1987, when he
played at a state dinner at the
White House during the historic Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius arrive
visit of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. Gorbachev leapt from P o t
his seat to give the pianist abear-
hug and kisses on the cheeks.
Nancy Reagan, then the first
lady, has called that night one of- -
the greatest moments of her hus- f j j LU
band's presidency.
"After not playing in public for Herbal remedy in
many years, he agreed to make
an exception for this occasion, Olympian's bedroom
and his beautiful music brought
the whole room to tears," Reagan after girlfriend was

adding that "the world has lost a shot to death

Pistorius spokeswoman
Lunice Johnston said in an email
to The Associated Press that the
athlete's lawyers had confirmed
that the substance is Testis com-
positum.
In the email, Johnston wrote
that the product was being used
"in aid of muscle recovery." She
did not say whether the sub-
stance was the same as the prod-
uct that is sold as a sex enhancer.
In court, Pistorius defense
lawyer Barry Roux said the sub-
stance was not banned by sports
authorities.
The World Anti-Doping
Agency said its science depart-
ment had already been made
aware of the substance and that
it wasn't banned.
"It would appear to be a
homeopathic treatment, and
these treatments are not prohib-
ited by the list," WADA said in a
statement to the AP.
Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of
the International Olympic Com-
mittee's medical commission,
told the AP he had not heard of
the product but that it sounded
like "a real cocktail, all pointing
in the same direction, namely
having something to do with tes-
tosterone."
"This sounds to me like some-
thing that needs to be analyzed
in order to make sure what it

is," Ljungqvist said in a phone
interview. "You cannot ban
something simply on claims and
names. It needs tobe looked into.
Even saying that it is testoster-
one boosting, it could contain
some precursors. It needs to have
some analysis."
Pieter Van Der Merwe, direc-
tor of South Africa's Doping
Control Laboratory in Bloem-
fontein, declined to comment on
whether a sample from Pistorius
had been sent to that laboratory
for testing.
Pistorius was charged with
premeditated murder in the
Valentine's Day shooting death
of Steenkamp. He says he shot
her by accident after mistaking
her for an intruder, in his home.
Prosecutors allege he intended to
kill her.
Police took Pistorius for a
medical examination when he
was arrested on Feb. 14, which
included blood-alcohol tests,
they said. The substance found
in his bedroom was also being
tested by police, who haven't
released results.
Pistorius, a multiple Paralym-
pic champion, underwent two
doping tests in London last year
around the Paralympics, the
International Paralympic Com-
mittee has said. He tested nega-
tive for any banned substances
in both tests in August and Sep-
tember. __

In Big Ten opener, Blue sweeps Michigan State

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan might have been
crushed by rival Michigan State
in men's basketball, but the No.
13 women's tennis team (1-0
Big Ten, _
7-3 over- MSU 0
all) wasn't MICHIGAN 7
due for a
similar fate. In its first Big Ten
match, the Wolverines took
on the Spartans (0-1, 8-3) on
Wednesday in Ann Arbor and
proved to be a terror, crushing
their rivals, 7-0.
"Any time you can play Mich-
igan State when you're Michi-
gan is big," said Michigan coach
Ronnie Bernstein. "It is a big
rivalry, and we wanted to play
well and we did that today."
Michigan started the meet off
right, winning point after point
in its doubles matches.
Leading the way was the
nation's No. 3 pair of sophomore
Emina Bektas and junior Brooke
Bolender. Earlier in the day,
Bektas was named the Big Ten
Player of the Week.
The pair started the match
strong, earning two quick
breaks. Playing with energy,
the pair was never broken on its
serve. When things took a turn
midway through the match,
the pair responded with tough
serves and returns, ultimately
leading to an 8-3 victory.
"We have a lot of playing

experience together," Bektas
said. "We played all of last year,
and we complement each other
well. We have improved on a lot
of things like our return game,
first volleys, getting to the net."
Michigan then looked to
clinch the point with a victory at
the No. 3 spot. Luckily, the new
tandem of freshman Amy Zhu
and senior Mimi Nguyen came
out firing on all cylinders.
Dominating the net and base-
line from the start of the match,
the Spartans could never get
going. The pair looked like it had
been playing together for years,
showing great chemistry and
poise in a win over Emily Mey-
ers and Julianne Gruber, 8-1.
Michigan's duo of freshman
Ronit Yurovsky and sophomore
Sarah Lee was well on its way
to victory, leading the Spartans,
6-2, but the match was halted
after Michigan had clinched the
doubles point.
The Wolverines looked to
continue their dominance in the
singles matches, but before they
began, Bernstein made a bold
decision.
She swapped Bektas out ofthe
No. 1 spot in favor of Yurovsky,
who has been a force on the
court recently, winning her last
13 matches.
"Either Ronit or Emina can
handle the top spot because they
are both team players," Bern-
stein said. "Wherever we put
them they will get the job done.

Sophomore Emina Bektas, the reigning Big Ten Player of the Week, was never broken in her 8-3 doubles win with junior Brooke Bolender.

But Ronit can definitely handle
it at number one."
It didn't bother Bektas, as she
cruised to a comfortable victory
over Catherine Parenteau, 6-3,
6-1.
The sophomore was too hard
to break, and just as Parenteau
gained momentum, Bektas
broke her service.

"I was trying to do what I
usually do - getting to the net,"
Bektas said. "I stayed in the
points and grinded out a few of
them and got the victory."
In her new role as the Wolver-
ines top singles player, Yurovsky
played like a wily veteran -
never letting her opponent gain
any momentum.

The freshman never got bro-
ken and fired back huge returns,
which guided her to a 6-2, 6-1
win.
Michigan took all of this
energy into the remaining
matches, gaining huge wins by
Bolender, Zhu and sophomore
Kristen Dodge.
"We took care of business

today," Bernstein said.
Michigan will try to again
take care of business on Satur-
day against No. 2 Duke.
"(Duke) is going to be a really
tough team, and we are going to
need everyone out there," Bek-
tas said. "We are all confident to
go out there and we believe we
can win."

Another senior night, another quiet Yost

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan hockey coach
Red Berenson has stressed
the importance of keeping the
opposing team's crowd - spe-
cifically its student section
- out of the game when the
Wolverines are on the road.
When Michigan's at home,
Yost Ice Arena is one of the
most formidable venues in the
CCHA. Its unofficial student
section, Children of Yost, shows
up early and constantly makes
noise while bantering the
opposing team's players.
. "They're unbelievable. They
come up with a little of every-
thing," said senior forward A.J.
Treais. "They've been great
to my class and all the classes
that have been here so I think
they're one of the best student
sections in the nation. It speaks
a lot about the Children of Yost
and what they've done and
what they put together every
day we come into the rink."

scheduling wasn't so favor-
in the minor- able to the Children of Yost -

starting in 2002, six of seven
senior nights took place with
the students on spring break,
though Yost later played host to
a CCHA Tournament series in
front of the students in each of
those seasons.
This won't be the only time
this season that a hockey series
was affected by the University
break schedule, though. The
Wolverines squared off against
Bowling Green the Wednesday
before Thanksgiving, and the
majority of the students weren't
in attendance. Some were scat-
tered among the regular seat-
ing, but Yost didn't have the
same atmosphere.
And the absence of the Chil-
dren of Yost comes at a crucial
time for the Wolverines. Michi-
gan currently sits in eighth place
in the CCH, but just five points
separate seventh and 10th place.
So if the Wolverines have a
good weekend, it's much more
likely that they wouldn't have
to play on the road in the first
round of the CCHA Tourna-
ment.
"It's not the same without the
students," Berenson said. "But
we can't let that be a factor or
worry about that. Our fans have
been great and spring break or
not, we're going to get a good
contingent of fans. Some stu-
dents might stay, but it won't be
the same. Nevertheless, we have
to create our own energy if it's
not there."

Offensive depth
showing early
for Wolverines

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Erik Bakich
preaches that good pitching and
sound defense make up the recipe
for playing good baseball.
But this past weekend, in a
three-game series against Ford-
ham, it was an offensive explosion
- 30 runs in three games - that
pushed the Wolverines forward.
"We really cut down on the
strikeouts," said freshman infield-
er Jacob Cronenworth. "(We)
really focused on our approach
and having quality at-bats every
time we came up to the plate."
Quality at-bats were more plen-
tiful this weekend as Michigan
recorded 32 hits against Fordham,
compared to just 25 against Cali-
fornia two weeks ago. Even bet-
ter news for the Wolverines is the
consistent balance within their
lineup.
Already this season, eight dif-
ferent players have recorded
1 an RBI, while 11 Wolverines
have scored at least one run. If
Michigan maintains this bal-
anced offensive production while
heading to the plate with a more
focused mindset, it's likely to
showcase more scoring outbursts
similar to this past weekend.
"It's just an improved offense,"
Bakich said. "I think some guys
are doing a nice job at the top of
the order and beyond. It's just
another week of development and
seeing more live competition."

Bakich also cited multiple
two-out RBI as a key factor in his
team's offensive progress against
Fordham. Clutch hitting was an
issue lastcyearthatthe Wolverines
have been working to improve
upon throughout these first few
weeks.
With just two days of practice
last week, Bakich and his play-
ers were able to make the neces-
sary adjustments during batting
practice, both mechanically and
mentally. The development of a
more concentrated approach at
the plate, along with mechanical
tweaks here and there, allowed
Michigan to finally show what its
offense is capable of.
"Our guys got after it and
worked really hard last week,"
Bakich said. "We wanted to make
sure that our focus was having
quality at-bats, and our guys did a
great job."
Now that the Wolverine bats
have found a rhythm, the most
difficult task will soon be to main-
tain consistency with timely hit-
ting.
Also, quality production from
the top to the bottom of the line-
up will play a crucial role in the
upcoming weeks.
"We just need to puta complete
weekend together, where we take
care of business start to finish,"
Bakich said. "I thought we played
two complete games against Ford-
ham, but we just need to be more
consistent offensively, defensively
and on the mound."

'M' blows 15-point lead in shocking loss to PSU

After No. 1 Indiana was upset
by Minnesota on Tuesday night,
the Michigan men's basketball

The Michigan forwards com-

offensive end. Though the Wol-

down low, they weren't able to
convert offensive rebounds into
baskets, scoring just 18 second-
chance points.
With the loss, Michigan has
now lost its last four games on the
road, and all season. The Wolver-
ines have had a tough slate away

Big Ten's best teams, but Beilein

we have other games to get ready

COMEDY SHOWCASE
From Page 1B
A community of comics
Yet despite the almost didactic
atmosphere the comedy club cre-
ates for its open mic nights, there
don't seem to be a lot of University
students present on Wednesdays.
"I have no idea," Feeny said.
"Last year we had quite a few com-
ing in. This year there's not that
many. Next year maybe there will
be some."
LSA senior Jake Fromm, one
of the few University students to
make regular Wednesday appear-
ances, pointed out that the meet-
ings for student organization LOL
ROFL Comedy Club also happen
to fall on Wednesday, so student
comedians have to choose which
venue is best for them. Fromm
(who is a former Daily photogra-
pher) is active in both, but noted
the value of the Comedy Show-
case.
"There's something really valu-
able about a real room with a mic
and a light and a crowd that's paid

to see you," he said. "I prefer to go
up and do the real thing instead of
workshopping."
Fromm only started doing
standup last May, but it's a passion
that he plans to pursue far into
the future. He hopes to get a job
teaching English in Asia when he
graduates and would like to pur-
sue comedy in New York at some
point.
"I don't know what the comedy
scene is like in Nepal, but there's
probably not going to be any open
mics there," he said.
Fromm's name was near the
bottom of the standby list the first
week that I went to see him, but he
was hopeful and prepared none-
theless. Before the show, he sat at a
table by himself, writing in a small
notebook and working out jokes in
his head.
"It's just bullet points and con-
cepts. Sometimes I'll have the
rhythm in my head and so I'll
write down exactly howthe joke is
going to go," he said. "But (usually
I'm) just writing down points that
I want to hit. Onstage you figure
out what works and what doesn't
work and even if you haven't writ-

ten down the exact words, you
probably could."
The show was running too long
that week, so Fromm never gothis
chance to perform. But he stuck
around anyway, laughing and
talking in the back with the rest of
the comedians. "There's a comrad-
ery," he told me. "A community of
comics ... the guys that go up alot
- theyall know each other."
Convenience and accessibility
Like many of the comics in this
small community, Fromm is just
trying to climb the ladder. Success-
ful open mics lead to emceeing,
emceeing leads to featuring, fea-
turing could get the attention of a
booking agent and a booking agent
just might lead to headlining - a
shot atstardom.
Comedians at every phase of
the process grace Feeny's stage
throughout the year, with the end
of the week devoted to the more-
established performers: the head-
liners.
In the last few years, the Show-
case has seen comedians with
national appeal, like Aziz Ansari,
Mas Jabroni and Doug Benson.
Joe Rogan, in Detroit announcing a
Saturday Ultimate Fighting Cham-
pionship fight, asked Feeny if he
could drop by the Friday before to
do a show.
Shows featuring this caliber of
comedian are rare on the calendar,
but when they do show up, it's usu-
ally in a situation like Joe Rogan's.
It gives them a chance to work out
some rougher material and to have
some fun in alow-key setting.
"We see them on the wayup and
we see them on the way down,"
Feeny said. "We're not going to see
them on the top because we don't
seat enough people, to be frank."
Most of the week's headliners
have a regional or budding popu-
larity, and come to spread their
name, develop an identity onstage
or just work a room with a solid
reputation.
Comedian David Dyer, who will
be performing Feb. 28 to March 2,
comes to the Showcase for many of
these reasons and shares an enthu-
siasm for the club with similar
headliners.

You don't
always need a
- happy ending

NATASHA JANARDEN/DAILY NATASHA IANARDEN/DAILY
The LOL ROFL Comedy Club performs every other Thursday at BTB Cantina. 'U' students write and perform their own stand-up material.

few weeks ago, while
competing in Berkeley,
Calif. with the Uni-
versity's premiere Bollywood
dance team, Michigan Manzil, I
found myself
talkingto
a reporter
aboutthe
importance
of happy end-
ings in Bolly-
wood stories.I
I explained PROMA
that filmi KHOSLA
dance rou--
tines, like
Bollywood movies, tend to end
happily.
"Inthe end, movies are all
about entertainment," I told him.
"We want the story to end on a
good note so that the audience
leaves feeling good about it."
Over the next few days, I
couldn't help reflecting on my
comments, and not just because
I felt like my answers made me
sound like a prize idiot. I believe
what I said and stand by it, so
why did the interview answer
feel so thin?
Last semester, Professor Jim
Burnstein told my "Fiction Into
Film" class that "movies are
ultimately simple emotional
journeys." A simple emotional
journey ends with positive reso-
lution and emotional fulfillment,
and Bollywood strives to uphold
those ideals.
In "Om Shanti Om," Om
(Shahrukh Khan) delivers one
of the most memorable speeches
in Bollywood, saying that in life,
like in film, everything is alright
in the end; if it's not all right,
then it's not the end (this English
translation is almost exactly the
earth-shattering quote that ties
together "The Best Exotic Mari-
gold Hotel." Hmph). He's kind
enough to spell out one of Bolly-
wood's primary narrative values
and to inadvertently explain the
reasoning for it; we want movies
to end happily because we want
life to follow suit.
As touching as Om's speech is
- touching enough that I vowed
long ago to repeat those words
if I ever win an award - it made
me take a second look at classic
Bollywood happy endings to see
if everything really is alright.
Even looking at "Om Shanti Om,"
the illusion started to fall apart
before my very eyes: Om and his
friends get revenge on the bad
guy, but his family still suffered
for 30 years without him, and
Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone)
still met aviolent end.
How about "Kuch Kuch Hota
Hai," every '90s kid's favorite
feel-good movie? Rahul (Shah-
rukh Khan) and Anjali (Kajol)
finally find each other, but Tina
(Rani Mukherji) is still dead and
Aman (Salman Khan), bless his
heart, is forever alone. In "Hum
Aapke Hain Kaun"? the story
wraps up with a big, boisterous
wedding, though the family has
barely digested the death of its
oldest daughter.
And what aboutthe films that
don't even try to end happily?
What about "Kal Ho NaasHo"?
The film is one of Karan Johar's
strongest screenplays and Nikhil

Advani's few directorial pur-
suits, yet it stands out among
both repertoires and viewer
experiences because it was just
so damnsad.
The film's irreplaceable posi-
tion in Bollywood history comes
entirely from this plot. Would
we remember it as well if Naina
(Preity Zinta) and Aman (Shah-
rukh Khan) rode off into the
sunset together? If Rohit (Saif Ali
Khan) didn'tcrepeatedly get his
heart broken, and no one cried
to sad music on the banks of
the Hudson River? An unhappy
ending can beas effective and
memorable asa conventional one
- and sometimes more so.
And they don't just stop at sad.
One of the most impactful mov-
ies I have ever seen is unques-
tionablyDeepa Mehta's "Earth:
1947," and that's because the last
few minutes were so horrifying "
that I've never quite shaken how
they made me feel. A main char-
acter suffers a terrible betrayal,
but even though I was deeply
disturbed by it, I came away with
a whole new understanding of
the movie's themes and how they *
relate to the real world.
Endinga movie uncomfort-
ably forces the audience to
think and cope. As much as we
hope for a happily ever after, we
should expect setbacks in real
life. After all, a movie doesn't
represent a lifetime - events
transpire before and after the
script's timeline to upset equilib-
rium. Things may be all right in
the end, but that isn't necessarily
the end of the movie.
You don't need
a feel-good
finish to enjoy
Bollywood
When those credits roll, the
characters are free of the cir-
cumstances that constrained
them, whether comedic,
catastrophic or anything in
between. We, as viewers, are
left to ponder the implications,
to weep over character deaths
or shake the shock of a traumat-
ic scene. We leave the theater
with the joy of watching Kajol
and Shahrukh get it together
once again because they belong
together.
Whatever the outcome, mov-
ies shape an audience member's
worldview. I appreciate the
impressions left upon me by
films both triumphant and trag-
ic. I love my classic Bollywood
endings where the hero and
heroine sing and dance their
way to happiness just as much
as I value the films that broke
my heart. I remind myself that,
when things aren't going so well
in real life, if it's not all right,
it's not the end.

Students release
through original
stand-up acts
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
There's a chance you've seen
one of the members of the LOL
ROFL Comedy Club passing
through the Diag, taking notes
in your biology lecture or sit-
ting next to you in a dining hall.
They're college students who go
to parties, date and stress about
finals. But once a week, this
seemingly random and normal
group of students - a frat boy, an
ice skater, an engineer and more
- meets in Mason Hall to tell
jokes. Really, really funny jokes.
Erich Laux, the club's co-
president, is a short, unassum-
ing Engineering junior who's the
last person you'd expect to be
part of a comedy club - let alone
run it. That being said, as soon as
we enter into a messy, unlocked
classroom on the second floor
of Mason and the club meeting
begins, Laux transforms from an
anonymous hooded anybody to
a one-man laugh track with the
most genuine and full-bodied
roar you've ever heard.
As different group members
stand up to run through jokes
for a performance at the BTB
Cantina the next night, Laux lis-
tens attentively and is as quick
to critique a joke's punchline as
he is to laugh at it. The rest of
the group members are just as
engaged and seem totally com-
fortable at both criticizing and
supporting one another.
"It's all in love," LSA fresh-
man Mackenzie Wolfgram tells
me. "If you just say, 'Wow that

was wonderful,' and then they
go up on stage and tell a bad joke,
and no one laughs, that's much
worse than getting told here."
Two members have gone, and
now it's Wolfgram's turn. As
soon as I see him smile suavely
at the group, I know it's going to
be good. He's a freshman, yet he
carries himself with the poise of
a veteran, and within minutes
the entire group is in an uproar.
Confident and personable, Wolf-
gram runs through a hilarious,
fluid set of relatable and quick-
witted stories, and by the end
I'm wiping tears out of my eyes.
Talking to Wolfgram after
the meeting, I'm surprised to
learn that he hadn't done stand-
up before joining the club. He
noticed the club's booth at Festi-
fall and thought to give it a try.
It's worked out better than he
expected.
"It's really weird. It was kind
of near exams last time, and
you're more focused on making
your jokes funny for the show
coming up than studying for
your exam," he says, smiling.
"Because for the exam it's just
you, but for the jokes, you're in
front of everyone and want to
impress them."
I learn almost immediately
in the meeting that there's a
major gap between being a
funny person and a great come-
dian. It takes a special blend
of personality, wit and, more
than anything, confidence. Just
watching the group members
perform in front of one another
makes my stomach churn anx-
iously.
"I was so nervous (when I
joined). I was probably as ner-
vous the first time standing up
to tell jokes with the group than
at the first show," Wolfgram

recalls.
Over the course of the meet-
ing, there's only one member
who doesn't perform. Instead,
Michael Dawes sits happily in
the corner, shouting out one-
liners with ease and nodding in
approval of the others' work. I
assumed he was one of the more
experienced members and am
shocked when he tells me that
he is an LSA senior performing
at his first show the next day.
"I originally got into (com-
edy) because my senior year
in high school my buddy said,
'Dawes, you're a really quirky
dude, which is great, but when
you first meet people you can-
not release the quirkiness on
them immediately; you gotta
internalize it and hide it until
you establish your friends in
college,'" Dawes says, laughing.
"So I was like, 'Alright, if I do
stand-up, I can live my life and
then that's how I can release
(the quirkiness).'"
Occupied with fraternity
life his first three years, Dawes
decided it was time for him to try
somethingelse.
"The shows are definitely the
scariest things and the most fun
things," Wolfgram explains, and
though I nodded in agreement,
I only truly understood what he
meant after what I saw happen at
the Cantina the next night.
I get to Cantina five minutes
before the show is scheduled
to start, and the place is almost
empty. A harsh white light illu-
minates a small wooden stage,
and a handful of chairs line the
front. The group members pace
around the bar, and I start to get
worried that no one will show.
Slowly, though, Cantina starts to
fill up, and at 9:12 p.m. the show
begins.

I pass by Dawes as I take a seat.
"I'm mad nervous," he tells me,
gripping a beer. "I'm drinking.
I'm just gonna go up there and
vomit."
By the time the host introduc-
es the first comedian, the room is
packed. I recognize some of the
members, but I'm taken aback
by how much they've improved
since the night before. Punch-
lines and stories that fell flat only
24 hours before have been trans-
formed into polished sets that are
making the whole crowd laugh,
and it's clear that these guys take
their comedy just as seriously as
their schoolwork, if not more.
Wolfgram's name is called, and
he struts to the stage with confi-
dence. He starts off a little fast
but settles into a groove within
the first minute. The crowd is
clapping, people are turning to
their friends with "how good is
this kid?" looks, and I sigh with
relief.
Then comes Dawes. I rub my
fingers nervously as I watch him
get on stage. He stands totally
rigid, holding the mic with a
tense grip, and I see the anxiety
in his face. Come on, Michael. You
got it. I think I'm just as scared as
he is.
He opens his mouth, and the
first joke he tells - a self-depre-
cating story about his fraternity
life - hits the crowd like a tidal
wave. People hoot, Dawes starts
to loosen up, and I even notice a
middle-age couple eating dinner
laughing.
He ends onabang, and I exhale
again. He survived his first show.
His friends cheer with pride from
a booth behind me, and the audi-
ence is clapping wildly. Dawes
steps to leave the stage, and,
glancing out at the crowd for a
brief moment, he lets out a smile.

WHERE WE LEAD,
YOU WILL FOLLOW.
