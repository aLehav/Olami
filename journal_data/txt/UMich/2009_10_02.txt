'U says its film
office will operate
even if cuts are made
ByJOSEPH LICHTERMAN
For the Daily
With the spotlight on Michi-
gan's legislature to balance the
state's budget, several state law-
makers are pondering whether to

lower the curtain on the state's tax
incentives for movies shot here.
The state offers filmmakers a
40 percent tax credit if they spend
more than $50,000 on production
costs in the state and an addition-
al 2 percent if they film in select
Michigan cities, including Ann
Arbor. It's this benefit that has
lured stars like Clint Eastwood
and Drew Barrymore to film their
movies in Michigan.
However, with a $2.8 billion

budget deficit for the 2610 fiscal
year, Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm and the Republican-
controlled state Senate have both
issued proposals to reduce the tax
credit.
Granholm's plan would lower
the incentive to 37 percent of pro-
duction costs.
Republicans, meanwhile, would
like to cut the credit to 35 percent
and cap the total rebate for all
films at $50 million annually. In

2008, the state paid out $32 mil-
lion to filmmakers.
Lee Doyle, director of the Uni-
versity's Film Office, said the tax
credit has spurred filming on cam-
pus.
"Beforethetaxincentivewesaw

Doyle said.

CAMPUS CRIME
DPS reports on-campus
crime data held steady

BYOP: BRING YOUR OWN PADDLE

Significant changes
seen in motor vehicle
theft, liquor arrests
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
A publication released yesterday
by the University's Department of
Public Safety reported that overall
campus crime levels for 2008 were
on par with 2007 levels, though
there were noticeable changes in a
few areas.
The 2009-2010 Campus Safety
Handbook - required by law under
the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of
Campus Security Policy and Cam-
pus Crime Statistics Act - includes
statistics of campus and area crime
reported to legal authorities and
campus officials.
Some of the changes in crime
levels from 2007 included the num-
ber of motor vehicle theft, drug law
arrests and liquor law arrests, cita-
tions and violations in residence
halls categories.
Motor vehicle thefts on campus
reported to University Police were
up from 4 in 2007 to 17 in 2008.
Department of Public Safe-
ty spokeswoman Diane Brown
explained that although the num-
ber is higher than last year, the
category is not limited to theft of
automobiles. The category also
includes theft or improper alloca-
tion of golf carts and Gators - small
utility vehicles used frequently

around campus.
In contrast, druglaw arrests on
campus were down a significant
amount, falling from 79 in 2007 to
56 lastyear.
Brown said she wasn't sure why
the number had fallen, since Uni-
versity Police weren't handling
violations differently than in 2007
or running any special campaigns
against drug use last year.
Though overall liquor law vio-
lations, arrests and citations on
campus saw only a modest increase
- from 952 reports to University
Police, University Housing and the
Office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution in 2007 to 1,077 reports to
the same agencies in 2008 - the
number of alcohol-related reports
increased substantially in the resi-
dence halls.
Residence hall liquor law viola-
tions, which are included in the
overall number of liquor law inci-
dents listed above, increased from
440 in 2007 to 526 in 2008. During
the same time, liquor law arrests
and citations increased from 135 to
240.
Asked about the fluctuation,
Brown said she wasn't certain what
caused the increase, but said sev-
eral factors influence the number
of alcohol violations, citations and
arrests campus-wide from year to
year.
"(The number) also includes
alcohol violations at the stadium
and some of the variance will
depend on how many home foot-
balls games we had that year,"

BY THE NUMBERS

2007 to 2008

Brown said, adding that the num-
ber of football games played at 3:30
p.m. can also influence the number
of alcohol-related reports.
Brown said the number of inci-
dents could vary not only on the
number of actual incidents, but also
on the number of reported inci-
dents. However, Brown said DPS
is working on ways to increase stu-
dent responsiveness to crimes.

Sober monitor program to grow

IFC teams with UHS
to improve safety at
fraternity parties
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
In an effort to create a safer
environment at fraternity par-
ties, the Interfraternity Council is
implementing a program that will
ensure that in four years every
member in the IFC community
will be a trained sober monitor.
Jason Mohr, IFC's vice president
of social responsibility, said the

training - which is done in part-
nership with University Health
Service - addresses crisis and
conflict management and focuses
on recognition of alcohol poison-
ing and the proper measures to
take when it occurs.
Sober monitors are fraternity
members who are required to
remain sober at parties in case of
an emergency.
Mohr, an LSA senior, said par-
ticipants will learn about ethi-
cal decision making and how to
be responsible partygoers, even
if they're not sober monitors that
night.
"It really tries to attack a party

from multiple different angles to
give you the safest environment,"
he said. "I think it's going to revo-
lutionize our community safety-
wise.
AriParritz, IFC's president, said
the IFC and UHS have been test-
ing the program for a number of
years and have arrived at the point
where they believe they have found
an effective method for training
sober monitors.
"We have a formula that works
really well," he said. "One that the
participants enjoy, but UHS feels
confident that they actually know
what they are talking about as

Texas judge: same-sex
marriage ban illegal

4

Attorney general
says he will
appeal ruling
DALLAS (AP) - A Texas judge
cleared the way for two Dallas men
to get a divorce, ruling yesterday
that Texas' ban on same-sex mar-
riage violates the constitutional
guarantee to equal protection
under the law.
Texas Attorney General Greg
Abbott said he'd appeal the rul-
ing, which he labeled an attempt
to strike downthe ban approved by
voters in 2005.
"The laws and constitution of
the State of Texas define marriage
as an institution involving one man

and one woman," Abbott said in a
written statement. "Today's ruling
purports to strike down that con-
stitutional definition - despite the
fact that it was recently adopted by
75 percent of Texas voters."
Abbott has argued that because
the state doesn't recognize gay
marriage, its courts can't dissolve
one through divorce.
District Judge Tena Callahan's
ruled yesterday, however, that the
court "has jurisdiction to hear a
suit for divorce filed by persons
legally married in another juris-
diction."
Jennifer Pizer, marriage proj-
ect director for the New York-
based gay rights group Lambda
Legal, said it is too early to pre-
dict the ultimate implications of

the lawsuit, in which neither man
is identified.
But Cathy Adams, president 4
of the conservative Texas Eagle
Forum, characterized the deci-
sion as a judicial overreach.
"Judicial activism is what
they're after, and it sounds as if
they found someone in Dallas to
participate in their endeavor," she
said. "The people of Texas have
spoken very strongly in opposi-
tion to same-sex marriage."
Peter Schulte, an attorney for
the man who filed for divorce, told
The Dallas Morning News that he
and his client are "ecstatic" over
the court's ruling. Schulte said the
decision was a surprise, and that
he hoped to have the judge sign a
divorce order in a few weeks.

"As a pastor, I'm referred to as

MEXICO CITY
Political scheme
turns Mexican
into odd celebrity
An eccentric street vendor
known for his Rambo-style head-
band took charge of Mexico City's
most populous borough Thursday
- at least for a few hours.
Rafael Acosta strode into Mexi-
co City's legislature with his arms
raised triumphantly and was
sworn into office. Immediately
after the ceremony, he requested
a leave of absence - part of an
elaborate political scheme that
has captivated Mexico.
The concept is this: Andres
Manuel Lopez Obrador, the lead-
er of Mexico's left, wants to hold
onto Iztapalapa, a poor but popu-
lous borough of 1.8 million people
that is the equivalent of a swing
state in presidential elections.
His candidate, Clara Brugada,
was defeated in his party's prima-
ry, so he offered to get the long-
shot candidate Acosta elected.
In return, Acosta agreed to step
down and give the position to her.
All went according to plan - until
Acosta won in a landslide and said
the deal was off.

Tsunami death toll
approaches 200

Samoans grieve over
lost relatives in wake
of Pacific earthquake
NAPIA, Samoa (AP) - Con-
voys of military vehicles brought
food, water and medicine to the
tsunami-stricken Samoas yester-
day as the death toll rose to 160
and victims wandered through
what was left of their villag-
es with tales of being trapped
underwater and watching young
children drown.
Samoan government minister,
Fiana Naomi, asked around 400
grieving relatives for permis-
sion to hold a mass funeral next
Tuesday. The grim-faced Samo-
ans, gathered under the shade
of a traditional wall-less meet-
inghouse just 100 yards from the
ocean amid coconut trees and
government offices, were largely
silent.
Samoans traditionally take
their loved ones and bury them
near their homes, but that could
be impracticable because many

of their villages have been wiped
out by early Tuesday's earth-
quake and tsunami.
Naomi told them the burial
would take place in a new cem-
etery in the city and that the gov-
ernment would also provide free
coffins for the 103 bodies cur-
rently held in the city morgue.
She said the other bodies had
already been buried due to the
advanced stage of decomposition,
but did not say how many.
The reaction to the proposal
was mixed, with some relatives
wanting to take the bodies and
have their own burials, while
others wanted a mass funeral
delayed for a week to allow chil-
dren and grandchildren to return
to the islands from overseas.
A total of 160 people are now
confirmed dead, including 120
in Samoa, 31 in American Samoa
and nine in Tonga.
Hundreds of police and oth-
ers resumed what Samoan police
commander Lilo Maiava called
"a painstaking search" for bod-
ies that could continue another
three weeks.

U.S. auto sales fell sharply in September, enduring a tough hangover from this summer's Cash for Clunkers buying spree.
Clunkers letdown causes
drop in recent auto sales

GM, Chrysler and
Ford report losses
for September
DETROIT (AP) - A Cash for
Clunkers hangover hit every
major automaker except Hyun-
dai last month, pushing down
sales and leaving the industry
searching for signs of a recovery
in October.
U.S. sales of cars and light
trucks fell to just under 746,000
in September, down 41 percent
from August.
Both GM and Chrysler were
the biggest losers last month,
while Ford, the healthiest of
the Detroit Three, reported the
smallest drop of major automak-
ers. Of the top companies, only
Hyundai posted higher sales, up
27 percent from September 2008.
Last month's slump brings car
and truck makers back to earth
following a heady August. Auto-
makers got a lift from clunkers,
which spurred sales of nearly
700,000 new vehicles during
the summer months. Big rebates
lured in many buyers who oth-
erwise would have waited until
later in the year to walk into deal-
erships.
Still, both GM and Ford said the
clunkers letdown should pass by
next month. They also forecast a
slight recovery in sales with signs
of economic improvement.
October, however, is tradition-
ally a slow month for sales. On

top of that, shoppers are guard-
ing their wallets, worried about
keeping their jobs in a fragile
economy. The question remains
whether dealers can really lure
them back and help the industry
recover over the remainder of the
year.
Higher incentives didn't shake
buyers from their September
slumber. Automakers spent an
average of $2,557 per vehicle in
the U.S., up $83 from August,
according to the auto Web site
Edmunds.com.
"After five straight months of
decline, incentives are on the rise
again," Edmunds analyst Jessica
Caldwell said. "Now that Cash
for Clunkers is over, automakers
have to give consumers an incen-
tive to buy - out of their own
pockets, not the taxpayers'."
Ford Motor Co.'s sales fell 5.1
percent, but the decline followed
two straight months of rising
sales. Two of the Dearborn, Mich.
company's vehicles - the Focus
and Escape - were top sellers in
the clunkers program.
General Motors Co.'s sales
plunged 45 percent while'
Chrysler Group LLC's fell 42 per-
cent. The weak results continued
a string of monthly sales drops
for the troubled pair. Now the
question is whether their govern-
ment-funded recovery plans are
working.
Sales fell in every GM divi-
sion. Saturn led the way with an
astounding 84 percent decline
in September, the same month

GM announced plans to abolish
the brand after its sale to former
race-car driver Roger Penske col-
lapsed.
"It was a more difficult month
than we anticipated," said Mark
LaNeve, GM's vice president of
U.S. sales.
A spokeswoman for the U.S.
Treasury Department, which
has provided roughly $65 billion
to keep GM and Chrysler going,
would not comment on the sales
figures.
Most automakers reported low
inventories during September but
said production increases were
starting to replenish them.
GM's LaNeve said last month
sales were compared with a
strong September in 2008 when
GM offered employee discounts
to every customer in celebration
of its 100th birthday. With easier
comparisons, October will show
better results.
He said the company could
have had stronger September
sales but it was struggling to
keep up with demand for newly
launched vehicles such as the
Buick LaCrosse sedan, Chevrolet
Camaro sports car, and the Chev-
rolet Equinox. crossover vehicle.
GM could have sold 10,000 to
12,000 more car and light trucks
had it been able to get them to
dealers in September.
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.
said sales fell 13 percent while
Nissan Motor Co. said its sales
eased 7 percent. Honda's sales
dropped 20 percent.

A pig and a protest
LGBT advocates should fight intolerance, not free speech
Last night, dozens of protesters gathered at the Blind Pig.
Members of the LGBT community and their supporters
turned out to protest the scheduled appearance of contro-
versial reggae artist Buju Banton. While Banton's lyrics advocat-
ing violence toward gay men certainly merit protest, the protesters
shouldn't have tried to force the Blind Pig to cancel the show. All
viewpoints, even those that are entirely detestable, deserve to be
heard, and criticism of Banton - and other fringe perspectives
like his - should never shift into criticisms of his right to speak.
Instead, they should be drowned out by reasonable views.

2'

'5 .

Body image goes both ways

The outcry from the LGBT community
came in response to some of Banton's lyr-
ics, which use derogatory slang terms for
gay men and advocate violence against
them. His controversial reputation led sev-
eral venues to cancel his concerts, includ-
ing the Mejestic Theatre in Detroit, which
was supposed to host him Wednesday. His
show was moved to the Blind Pig in Ann
Arbor, which prompted the LGBT commu-
nity to attempt to secure his show's cancel-
lation, arguing that his blatantly violent
lyrics should not be hosted in the venue.
Among the protesters at the Blind Pig on
Wednesday were LGBT activist groups,
University students and Ann Arbor Mayor
John Hieftje.
It is disgusting for someone to advocate
the things Banton advocates in his song
"Boom Bye-Bye," including shooting gay
men with Uzis and, arguably, pouring acid
on them. People were correct to take issue
with Banton's backward and offensive
message. But by making the protest about
the Blind Pig's decision to host this artist,
the protesters crossed a line. While it's true
that the protesters have a right to oppose
the Blind Pig's decision, they shouldn't
have focused on silencing Banton. Free-
dom of speech isn't just a legal protection
- it's a moral position as well. Freedom of

speech rests on the precept that everyone
can speak as they wish, and those with
fringe, disgusting views like Banton's are
brought to light as such by everyone else.
But even more troubling about the efforts
to censor this view is Hieftje's role in it.
As a governmental official, Hieftje can't
be reasonably considered separate from
the office he holds, and his attempts to
convince the Blind Pig to cancel the show
were especially detestable considering his
status. Hieftje, as a figurehead for the city,
shouldn't be positioning himself against
free speech.
It's true that the despicable nature of
Banton's message makes the LGBT com-
munity's reaction somewhat understand-
able, especially when one considers all the
obstacles to social acceptance that LGBT
individuals continue to face. Hate crimes,
social stigma and marriage laws are only a
few of the discriminatory adversities these
people live with. But progress toward
LGBT acceptance won't come by censoring
views of intolerance and hate - it will come
by hearing and repudiating these views.
Ann Arbor's LGBT community rightly
protested Banton last night, but partly for
the wrong reasons. Next time, students
and city officials should wage their battles
more carefully.

ith shows like "The Big-
gest Loser" and "More
to Love" popping up all
over primetime
television and the
evening news's
obsession with the
obesity epidemic, "
body image issues
have gotten a lotv
of publicity. Wom-
en's magazines
like Cosmopolitan
are always offer- JAMIE
ing cosmetic and BLOCK
confidence tips
to women who,
despite already
being at a desirable weight, still feel
they need to look better (and need
44 new ways to please their men).
But in all of these media outlets, one
group remains tragically uncovered:
underweight males.
As someone who stands at a
decently tall 6'4" but weighs in at
just under 140 pounds, I often find
myself looking in the mirror, won-
dering if museums would hire me to
pose as skeleton. But more often, I
find myself making little jokes just
like that one as a coping mechanism
so I don't think about what's really
on my mind: How could anybody be
attracted to someone whose ribs are
visible nearly all the time?
Walking around campus, it's hard
not to notice the large population
of muscular, fit, healthy-looking
guys. It's not that they jump out or
anything, but they're everywhere. I
know it's fickle of me to be upset that
I don't look like them, but it's hard to
stop wishing for something you see
countless others achieving almost
effortlessly.
Beyond letting body image issues,
ferment on my own, I have had a fair
share of nicknames and jokes made
about my particular build, nearly all

of which I have at least pretended
to be on board with. To name a few:
"Skeletor," "Holocaust victim," "tf
you turned sideways you'd disappear"
and "Watch out for light breezes."
Admittedly, many of the jokes are
somewhat funny, but they certainly
don't help me feel any better about
myself in the long run. I appreci-
ate them as an escape from shame,
though. Hell, I even made a Skeletor
T-shirt for myself in middle school.
I wanted friends, so I was forced to
turn my flaws into something likable.
The fact that some people have
body image issues and that others
make jokes about is nothing new. It's
obviously not a good thing, but it's not
unique to my situation. What under-
weight men face that others don't is
the lack of readily available support
and comfort. In all the school-spon-
sored discussion on body image I've
attended since middle school, my sit-
uation has never come up. Nor does
it come up on primetime TV, on the
news or in magazines. Underweight
males need to be a part of body image
discussions from the start, not just a
statistic used to make the other num-
bers look bigger.
Along with having these body
issues underpublicized is an inherent
guilt abouthavingthe issue in the first
place, which can worsen already low
self-esteem. Whenever I complain to
anyone looking to lose even a little
bit of weight, my complaints are met
with statements like "Are you kid-
ding? I'd kill to be thin like you." But
you never see someone who wants to
gain weight lamenting that they can't
be more like their overweight friends,
because the media has trained us to
think that this is obviously insen-
sitive, while forgetting to mention
that the struggle can go both ways.
Not only am I physically weak, but I
also lack the mental and emotional
strength to accept who I am.

It's not enough to have an emerg-
ing group of young, thin, hipster
male role models. Just because
there are famous people built like
me doesn't make me feel any more
adequate. What I need is for my lack
'of confidence to be taken seriously,
not tossed away as an unreason-
able complaint from someone with
a divinely bestowed metabolism.
This pressure to be macho, when
unchecked, can lead to steroid abuse
and other unhealthy habits like hing-
ing on fatty foods, not to mention
intense depression. Imagine hating
yourself every time you wear short
sleeves because you have to look at
your skinny arms and wrists, and
you'll start to get the idea.
Underweight
people can have
low self-esteem, too.
While underweight males are
arguably one of the smallest groups
in the bad body image pie chart, I
can guarantee that most of you know
a male who, whether he admits it
or not, wishes he could bulk up. As
someone who has been dealing with
this problem for as long as I can
remember, I beseech you to be sen-
sitive with these friends, regardless
of how "okay" they may seem to be
with their weight and build. The
common saying of "the bigger they
are, the harder they fall" just doesn't
hold up here - the small can fall just
as hard, and it doesn't take much to
tip them over.

The brighter side of business

TO THE DAILY:
In Vincent Patsy's recent column, he devel-
ops his entire argument upon the basic idea
that people are paid less because they are less
productive (Policing equal pay,.09/30/2009).
The economic principles stated in his col-
umn - that, in the free market, people would
be paid what they ultimately deserve - are
undoubtedly true on a two-dimensional
model. However, that view, like many simple
economic models, completely ignores social
context.
Patsy's description of the "outbidding" pro-
cess is unrealistic. Workers can't actively com-
pare wages and continuously shift between an
infinite number of jobs as they please. Like-
wise, employers don't constantly observe a
pool of workers, vying for labor and thrilled to
pay high wages. Employers will, of course, pay
less if they can. That's the entire basis of pay
discrimination in the workplace.
Since the Lilly Ledbetter Act was cited in
Patsy's column, itrcan be assumed that the argu-
ment is mainly about the pay gap between men
and women. Patsy's column revolves around
the assumption that the group that earns less
is "less productive and (produces) fewer goods
per day (than those who snake more)". This
point is the argument's biggest and most insult-
ing flaw. It is both arrogant and misleading to
suggest that women earn less simply because
they are inherently less productive.
It's unfortunate that groups with histories
of oppression make less money, but it's not
entirely surprising. It is, however, shocking
that some people still imply that it's due to an
inborn racial or gender inferiority.
Kaitlin Henry
LSA sophomore

TO THE DAILY:
Though Vincent Patsy's latest column voices
an interesting concern about Obama's efforts
to level the playing field in terms of wage dis-
crimination, he overlooks and skews some
key points that are important to keep in mind
(Policingfair pay, 09/30/2009). Stating that the
market is the most useful tool in which to cure
inequality is overly simplistic, unrealistic and
even irresponsible.
In order to make noticeable strides toward
actual equality at the workplace, to borrow
Patsy's advice, based upon talent and devotion
alone, efforts must be made and action must be
taken to ensure that the ground is fair at the
beginning. By ignoring racial and gender-based
policies, whether intentional or de facto (an
unimportant qualifying tool, as discrimination
is discrimination), we're allowing these poli-
cies to perpetuate. The Obama administration is
nobly trying to amend an already set system of
flawed favoritism.
Sometimes, when deficient - if not blatantly
unfair - practices like pay discrimination are
not explicitly spelled out in policy, it is easy to
believe that they have arisen as a result of natu-
ral causes and therefore will be fixed, lessened
or accepted by waiting. But it would be ineffec-
tive to rely on the market change itself or become
organically evened because it has no interest in
doing so.
More importantly, there are human ways to
expedite the process and rectify the situation.
Allowing the government to step in and assist in
creating a justbase is far from nepotism - in fact,
standing back and watching a stoppable stagger
continue as Patsy suggests would be just that.

uring my time at the Univer-
sity, I've become aware of ste-
reotypes surrounding various
majors. College lore
says that General
Studies students ,
find it difficult to
spell their names
correctly, while it's -
believed that Envi-
ronmental Studies
majors live deep
in the woods and BRIAN
smoke great quan- FLAHERTY
tities of pot. And a_
common assump-
tion about Business
students like me is that we are moti-
vated by selfish interests like making
money. But like many of the labels that
get thrown around on college cam-
puses, that one misses the point of why
people choose Business asa major.
Of course, that's notto saythatmon-
ey-grubbers are a rarity in the world
of business. There are more than a few
Ross School of Business students who
are ready and willing to offer 90-hour
work weeks and years of their lives to
prestigious but cutthroat firms. Busi-
ness programs tend to be a magnet
for intelligent, aggressive people who
dream about Maseratis and Hermes
handbags. But many people are drawn
to business for other reasons.
Personally, I wasn't certain that I
wanted to study business until, during
high school, I learned a true story that
most Business majors learn about here
at the University. The story is about
river blindness, a debilitating disease
caused by a parasite commonly found
near rivers and streams in Africa.
When transmitted to a human host
by the bite of a common black fly, this
parasite multiplies and, if untreated,
causes itching, skin disfigurement,
lesions and eventual blindness. For
million of children in many African
villages, the existence of this parasite
meant that growing up blind was sim-
ply an unavoidable part ofgrowingup.

Until the 1980s, there were no good
options for fighting river blindness. But
that changed because Merck, a large
pharmaceutical company, did some-
thing that had never been done before.
After identifying a substance that had
little commercial value but did have
the potential to treat river blindness,
Merck invested millions (at a financial
loss) to develop and test a drug called
Mectizan. It turned out to be very
effective in treating river blindness,
and in 1987, Merck's managers pledged
to provide Mectizan free of charge to
anyone who needed it (a commitment
that Merck continues to honor today).
An estimated 16 million children have
been spared from river blindness due
to control efforts involving Mectizan,
and Merck has set a goal of completely
eradicating the disease by 2020.
Mectizan is tangible proof that a
good business can do much more than
generate money. At their best, enter-
prises aren't soulless machines run
by robots. Instead, they are groups
of people working together to shape
the world according to their values.
Merck's first purpose, according to its
mission statement, is "preserving and
improving human life." But one thing
that high-performing companies like
Merck,Boeingand GE have in common
is that they are built around cultural
values other than money. In fact, busi-
ness research gurus like Jim Collins
have found that the highest perform-
ing firms don't set profit maximization
as their main goal.
A recent survey of big pharmaceuti-
cal firms showed that Merck isn't sim-
ply an anomaly - respondentsreported
donating 13 percent of their income to
charitable causes. Actions that aren't
strictly profit-driven take place across
industry boundaries. Many shoppers at
Target would be surprised to learnthat
five percent of the company's income is
donated in order to serve community
issues. Finance textbooks and econo-
mists can claim that the primary goal
of a business should be to maximize

profits, but an alternative view is that
profits are simply a necessary condi-
tion for a business to continue its work
- which can be whatever its managers
and shareholders wish it to be.
Business majors
are more than
money-grubbers.
Unfortunately, business students
and corporations have recently got-
ten a bad reputation. Events like the
financial meltdown, companies like
Enron and managers like Bernie
Madoff have exposed the fact that
the private sector can fail and is often
overly driven by short-term oppor-
tunism. Left unchecked, businesses
can do nasty and unethical things in
the pursuit of profits, ranging from
stealing from investors to dumping
poison into rivers.
In debates over business and assess-
ments of business people, it's impor-
tant to see the good in addition to the
ugly. Private enterprises have occa-
sionally given us problems, but they've
also given us solutions: cars, Mac and
Cheese, global supply chains, iPods
and most other modern conveniences.
In a century that is likely to see a ris-
ing population, increasing scarcity of
resources and wide-scale environmen-
tal challenges, enterprises will con-
tinue to act in ways that preserve and
improve the quality of life for billions
of people. And behind a lot of those
enterprises, there will be managers, a
lot of them former business students,
who see profit as a tool with impact
rather than an end goal.

Fox's brotherly disaster

Mike (played by the recently

of the New York Giants) flies home
to his family because his father
(Carl Weathers, "Happy Gilmore,"

While it becomes clear that the
stroke is merely a ruse put on by his
mother (CCH Pounder,"Warehouse

den problems become apparent.
The most central problem, it
would seem, is the constant and
obnoxious bickering that occurs
between Mike and his wheel-
chair-confined brother Chill

roquette Show"). At times, the

in this film is Iron Maven (Juliette

now, in "Whip It," these people are
more than just autocratic dream

have more than their fair share
of vices, secrets and insecurities
hidden behind the fagade of their
values-driven lifestyle.
While "Whip It" is certainly
a female-empowering film, men
are not simply thrust off to the
side either. Two of the film's more
memorable characters are Razor
(Andrew Wilson, "Idiocracy") the
jean-shorts-clad coach of the Hurl
Scouts, and Jimmy Fallon (TV's
"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon") as
"Hot Tub" Johnny Rocket, the der-
by's animated announcer. Razor's
deadpan delivery and Rocket's
witty commentary generate some
of the biggest laughs in the film.
The film's soundtrack also
stands out, with the angelic melo-
dies of Radiohead adorning poi-
gnant scenes and the furious beats
of the Kaiser Chiefs fueling the
high-octane roller derby matches.
A quality chick flick is a rare
treat, so boyfriends or girlfriends,
take note. "Whip It" is lovable,
touching, energetic and even a lit-
tle inspiring.

Keeping summer alive

For many, the word "Princeton"

Princeton isn't a band of Ivy

Beer in Hell," At Quality16
and it sums up and Showcase
the philosophy
of the movie per- Freestyle
fectly. The main
characters, three bros in their late
20s, make incredibly poor deci-
sions - or more accurately, they
allow their ringleader, Tucker
Max (Matt Czuchry, "Gilmore
Girls") to make poor decisions for
them, and everyone else suffers
from the consequences.
We're even supposed to care
when Tucker's actions screw
over the group. Fat chance. Hang
around guys like him and you get
what you deserve.
The film is based on the book
of the same title by the real-life
Tucker Max (who also co-wrote
the screenplay). The book consists
of Max detailing various lewd and
audacious episodes of his life in a
manner that alternates between
gloating and self-shaming. The
book has been a best seller since its
2006 publication, bucking the ste-
reotype that frat boys don't read.
The film "Beer in Hell" stretches
one of the book's stories to feature
length. Tucker's friend Dan (Geoff
Stults, TV's "October Road") is
throwing his bachelor party, and
Tucker convinces him and their
other, more sardonic, friend Drew
(Jesse Bradford, "Flags of our
Fathers") to drive to a strip club
hours outside of town. Tucker also
makes Dan commit to the excur-
sion behind his fiancee's back. The
mastermind's stated reason for
this venture is that, because all the
local strip clubs have a "no touch-
ing" policy that Tucker refuses to

what happens when dicks like
Tucker aren't controlled, it could
have been a future cult classic.
But "Beer in Hell" is ultimately
too afraid (or admiring) of its
despicable ringleader to push him
as far as he needs to go.
Tucker Max is a hero to many
college dudes for obvious reasons
- he makes a lifestyle out of drink-
ing, partying and being an asshole
to women. He's the straight male's
id with a sense of humor. And in
the movie, Czuchry plays Tucker
with a stupid grin permanently
plastered on his face and a reckless
demeanor that communicates just
how little he cares about the world
around him. Czuchry makes the
audience hate him from the very
start, which is exactly how the
character should be portrayed.
In a poorly calculated move,
however, the filmmakers decide
to exile Tucker from the middle
third of the film. In his place,
Tucker's two buddies, Dan and
Drew, awkwardly become the
emotional center of a movie that's

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
Tension with partners and close
friends is likely because of today's Full
Moon, which is occurring in your sign.
Patience!
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Difficulties with co-workers, as well
as difficulties with small pets and health
issues, might come to a head today
because of today's Full Moon. Just cope
as best you can.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Parents will need extra patience with
children today because of the Full Moon.
Similarly, romantic partners will need
patience with each other.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
The conflict between the demands of
home and family and the demands of
your career or your external world could
be challenging today. This is what the
Full Moon can do with you! (It's gone in
a few days.)
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
It's the Full Moon today, and this par-
ticular Full Moon is an accident-prone
time for your sign. Therefore, allow
extra time for everything, and avoid
haste or impulsive actions.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
This is a dicey day for finances, cash
flow, purchases, earnings and even your
possessions. Today's particular Full
Moon hits you in these areas.
LIBRA
(Sept 23 to Oct.22)
This is the only Full Moon opposite
your sign all year. That's why you'll feel
increased tension dealing with partners
and close friends. (This means you have

to be extra patient.)
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Disputes with co-workers or people
related to your job might arise today
because of today's Full Moon. Try to be
patient and let things slide a bit. Cut peo-
ple some slack.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Parents should be increasingly mind-
ful today, because this is an accident-
prone day for your kids. Romantic part-
ners should not be hasty to criticize or
fight. Cool your jets!
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
You're pulled in two directions today.
You're caught between the demands of
home and family versus the demands of
your career and your outer world. Do
your best; nevertheless, you cannot
ignore your career.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
This isan accident-prone time for you
because of this particular Full Moon.
Allow yourself extra time for every-
thing. Think before you act and speak.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
Keep track of your pennies today.
Today's Full Moon can confuse your
finances. Watch your cash flow.
YOU BORN TODAY You're tuned in
to society, fashion and trends.
Personally, you're intense in everything
that you do. You have high standards and
like to see things done correctly. You
know how to play a role to get a
response from others that you want. This
year might be one of the most powerful
years of your life. Reach for what you
want!

ferent kind ofcar company, appears
as dead as Pontiac and Oldsmobile.
At the brand's 350 remaining
dealers around the country, there
were high hopes that a deal would
be announced for GM to sell the
brand to former race car driver
and auto industry magnate Roger
Penske.
Instead, Penske Automotive
Group Inc. announced Wednes-
day it is walking away from the
deal, unable to find a manufactur-
er to make Saturn cars when GM
stops producing models sometime
after the end of 2011. GM then
announced it would stop mak-
ing Saturns and soon would close
down the brand, just like it did

the aisle," Brater said. "There's no
guarantee the Republicans will
come across with support for those
revenues, so it's just a major chal-
lenge right now to get some bipar-
tisan support for revenues."
According to Phil Hanlon, vice
provost for academic and budget-
ary affairs, the University set aside
one-time funds when establishing
the University's budget for this
academic year to fill these expect-
ed financial aid gaps.
"When we did put together this
year's budget we did ... note that at
least one of the houses of the leg-
islature eliminated funding for the
Promise Scholarship, so we also
set aside some one-time funds,"
Hanlon said in an interview with
the Daily last week.
The scholarship program was
supposed to provide up to $4,000
for approximately 5,000 Universi-
ty students for the 2009-2010 aca-
demic year, according to Margaret
Rodriguez, the University's senior
associate director of financial aid.
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice presi-
dent for government relations for
the University, said the Univer-
sity's commitment to meet the full
demonstrated financial need of in-
state students has not wavered.
"We have committed to meet-
ing the full financial need and
we have been prudent in the way
we have budgeted so that we will
have resources for those students
who have the financial need and
as of now, do not appear to be
receiving the Promise grants,"

FILM OFFICE
From Page 1

the University did not have a film
office. The office was created
last spring to handle the influx
of requests to produce movies on
campus.
Two films have already been
filmed on campus in 2009 - "Betty
Anne Waters" featuring Hilary
Swank, and "Trivial Pursuits,"
which was written and directed by

with Oldsmobile in 2004 and soon
will do with Pontiac.
The day's events mean an almost
certain end to Saturn, a brand that
was set up in 1990 to fight growing
Japanese imports. Instead of cel-
ebrating a rebirth, the announce-
ments sent dealers scrambling for
ways to stay open and preserve
about 13,000 jobs.
"I find this hard to believe," said
Carl Galeana, owner of two Saturn
dealerships in suburban Detroit.
"Everyone's been saying we're
right at the goal line."
Saturn, officially launched in
1990, featured the iconic tag-line
"a different kind of car company"
and people were attracted by its
low-key showrooms and no-haggle
pricing.
GM's hope was that Saturn,
with its dent-free plastic panels,
would attract younger buyers with
smaller, hipper cars. It built a new
plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., devoted
to Saturn vehicles.
Despite a cult-like following
that drew thousands to annual
reunions in Spring Hill, the brand

never made money, although the
company has never disclosed how
much it invested or lost.
Although GM and Penske
reached a tentative agreementto sell
the brand in June, the deal collapsed
Wednesday after Penske was toldby
an unidentified manufacturer that
its board had rejected a deal to make
cars for the new Saturn.
"It was a stunning turn of
events," said GM spokesman Tom
Pyden, who added that most of the
details between GM and Penske
had been worked out and both sides
expected to announce this week
that the deal had been closed.
GM had agreed to keep building
three Saturn models even beyond
2011, but after that, Penske had
to come up with its own products
made by another manufacturer.
PenskespokesmanAnthonyPor-
don said there is little if any chance
that the talks could be reopened.
Without another supplier in place
before the deal was signed, Penske
couldn't run the risk of taking on
Saturn, Pordon said.
It takes several years to design

new vehicles or engineer foreign
vehicles to meet U.S. standards.Pen-
ske would risk havingno products to
sell once the GM contract expired.
The French automaker Renault
discussed building cars for Penske
but Renault spokeswoman Fred-
erique Le Greves said in an e-mail
Thursday that "the conditions for
an agreementhave notbeen found."
She said the decision was made by
the Renault executive board.
Penske's purchase price was
never disclosed, and he will not
have to pay a termination fee,
Pyden said. Penske shares tumbled
$1.13, or 5.9 percent, to $18.05 in
premarket trading yesterday.
GM will stop making Saturns as
soon as possible, but no layoffs are
expected, said spokeswoman Sher-
rie Childers Arb. Saturns are made
at plants in Kansas City, Kan.;
Delta Township, Mich., near Lan-
sing and Ramos Arizpe, Mexico.
"Those plants produce products
for other brands, and we think
we can increase volume on those
products that will meet market
demand," Childers Arb said.

Lead researcher says
study's findings
may be overblown
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
Daily StaffReporter
A new study commissionedahy
the National Foothall League and
conducted by researchers from the
University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research may add to an
increasing level of scrutiny over
whether concussions sustained
while playing foothall could have
long-term consequences for play-
ers. But the study's top researcher
says that some of the findings may
be blown out of proportion.
Dr. David Weir, the report's lead
author, said a surprising number
of professional football retirees
age 50 and above reported having
been diagnosed with dementia,
Alzheimer's disease or other mem-
ory-related illnesses.
"We found that there was a sub-
stantially higher rate of people say-
ing they did have such a diagnosis
among the NFL retirees compared
to the general population of men
the same age," Weir said.
NFL retirees reported diagnoses
of dementia and related illnesses
at a rate of more than 6 percent -
more than five times the national
average, which is about 1.2 percent.
But the difference, Weir said, may
be partly a result of the survey
design and that conclusions should
not be taken too seriously.
The NFL and its Player Care
Foundation approached the Uni-
versity's Institute for Social
Research to investigate the welfare
of pension-eligible retirees. The
resulting survey, which was con-
ducted last November, compiled
the data from phone interviews
with a sample of 1,063 former pro-
fessional players.
Weir, also an associate director
at the University's Survey Research
Center, said cognitive decline was
only a small component of the over-
all survey, which covered a wide
range of topics, including marital
status, income and employment of

participatingretirees.
Modeled partly after the Nation-
al Health Interview Survey, the
report noted more concrete trends
for health concerns, like arthritis
and general joint pain - conditions
prevalent in the sampled retirees.
The survey also relied on several
mental health questions to screen
for depression and anger. However,
the University survey asked only
one question soutdiagnoses of
cognitive illness.
Not yet peer-reviewed, the sur-
vey's researchers admitted that a
higher rate of dementia diagnoses
may also he attributed to the signif-
leant interaction hetween foothall
playersandtheirdoctors,compared
to the interaction between doctors
and the general population.
"A telephone survey is not going
to be adequate when you want to
make an assessment of whether a
person has dementia or cognitive
impairment," Weir said. "More
high quality scientific research is
needed to actually establish this
relationship."
The survey has already prompt-
ed the NFL to begin conducting its
own scientific inquiry with a subset
of retirees - after the league his-
torically pushed off similar studies
in the past.
Weir said the impact at the col-
legiate and high school levels for
football remains to be seen, but
the concerns would be equally rel-
evant.
"If there really are health con-
sequences, there's a much larger
group of people affected than in
just professional sports," he said.
If a definitive causation is estab-
lished, the appropriate regulatory
measures and equipment will be
needed to minimize the number of
concussions or related head inju-
ries, Weir said. Further study into
the actual relationship between
participation in football and cogni-
tive decline will also provide some
context for the nature of memory
disorders, he said.
"It's not just about the football,"
Weir said. "Dementia is a really
serious public health problem and,
as the population ages, it's going
to become even more so in the
future."


Despite being killed yesterday, the Michigan Promise Scholarship may find new life in a House bill that would save the program.

Wilbanks said in an interview
yesterday.
The budget agreed upon by the
House and Senate, including the
higher education bill, still has to be
sent to Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm for approval.
In a press release yesterday,
Granholm wrote that the budget
passed by the two houses does
not demonstrate the key elements
Michigan needs during this eco-
nomic time, including a way to
make college affordable.
"Michigan's future demands
a budget that helps us diversify
our economy to create the jobs we
need; that keeps police officers and
fire fighters on the streets of our

Brown also said DPS is engaging
in a "10 Point Pledge" campaign to
raise awareness of how DPS can

cases go unreported, especially
sexual assaults.

Granholm wrote in the release.
"The budget the legislature has
passed fails to do all of these essen-
tial things."
Granholm wrote that she will
be examining the budget and will
create one that meets these vital
components.
"So while I am disappointed
with the budget that resulted from
the legislature's actions, I am deter-
mined to use my power in this pro-
cess to give the people of Michigan
a fiscally sound budget with the
right priorities - diversifying our
economy to create jobs, educating
our citizens, and protecting those

Brown said. "We have to continue
to work to help people understand
the importance of being able to

protections that can be placed
around a survivor who is making

Brown said students can also
reduce campus crime by securing
"We always have a steady stream
of activity like that, but in terms
of commercial films, though, that
will diminish," she said.
Doyle said even without an
influx of Hollywood celebrities
arriving on campus to make their
movies, the University will contin-
ue to operate its film office because

Liz Boyd, press secretary for

passed legislation that would gen-

"Clearly the governor has said
she is going to take her steps to

Doyle said the Film Office is
interested in continuing its efforts
to promote the University as a way
of attracting filmmakers to Ann

lighting the University whenever
possible," Doyle said. "To make the
University shine and having it star

SOBER MONITOR
From Page 1
soon as the training is done."
The number of sober monitors
present at each party is determined
by the number of people in atten-
dance and can range from five to
18.
Right now the training consists
of one session, which Parritz said
is very interactive and includes
question-and-answer sessions and
role-playing.
"They do that for a reason," he
said. "They know that at night they
aren't necessarily going to have the
instant attention of 20 to 25 fresh-
men."
Mohr said many sober monitors
are often unclear on their duties,
but he hopes that after the new
training they'll be more aware and
responsible.
"Everything will be safer hope-
fully," he said. "It allows our new
members to be trained prior to
actually working at an event. So,
hypothetically, they should know
everything and they'll have the
resources and knowledge and the
confidence to step up when they see
something wrong."
Parritz said the IFC is very
excited to get the program off the
ground and see the good it will
bring its community.
"It was started by the board
before we came in, so we've inher-
ited this project that was sort of in
its infancy," he said.
Mohr said he thinks the com-
munity will see the benefits of the
program immediately.
"I'm just so excited to be able to
go to an event and realize that these
kids have been trained, they know
what they're doing, and I won't
have to worry as much," he said.

Parritz said the IFC and UHS are
also adding peer facilitators to the
program, whose roles in the session
would be to facilitate role-plays and
other interactive portions of the
session.
LSA sophomores Jacob Hat-
tenbach and Jay Siegel, peer facili-
tators who participated in the
training programlast semester, said
they both agreed with the message
behind the program but felt they
could improve the presentation.
"We aim to spread knowledge
about its effects in order for stu-
dents to respond to real life emer-
gencies that they may confront at
any given time," Hattenbach wrote
in an e-mail. "We believe that these
alcohol awareness presentations
need not be given solely by distant
authority figures but also by stu-
dents who have experienced these
circumstances themselves."
Daniel Kipper, president of Chi
Phi fraternity, said he thinks the
program will be effective in theory,
but he's skeptical that it will signifi-
cantly change the environment at
parties.
"I think it's a good idea on
paper," Kipper, an Engineering
junior said. "There's no harm in
having more training, but from a
risk management and party run-
ning point of view, I don't think
it'll have too much of an effect,
which is normally where the main
problems are."
Jon Lindner, Delta Tau Delta's
president an attendee of the pro-
gram last semester, said though
some of the knowledge behind
sober monitoring can be learned
through first-hand experience, he
feels the new training programwill
be beneficial.
"It couldn't hurt," he said. "It's
not boring, it's fun, interactive and
it doesn't take very long."

Dear diary, BISHOP
I'm sorry
it's been so
long since I last wrote. I finally grew
out of my Live Journal and Xanga
accounts, so I'm in the process of
converting you to paper.
I can't believe my last entry was
dated Oct. 24, 2008. A lot has hap-
pened since that day. Back then, we
were coming off a loss to Toledo
two weeks earlier. It didn't get much
better. The loss to Michigan State
the next day was crushing. Despite
our horrible record, our players had
us convinced our s--- didn't stink
against those guys. I guess most of
them are LSA majors for a reason.
And don't even get me started on
those quarterbacks. We had Nick
Sheridan, who simply is not good.
Then there was that one guy, from
Adrian, what was his name? Came
from Georgia Tech? Thorpe? Thri-
ple? Treat? Well, whatever his name,
he wasn't any good, either. Then
there was McGuffie. Oh, Sam. High

school all-star into Big Ten washout.
Turns out his hype couldn't hold
a candle to Beanie Wells or Javon
Ringer, two backs that shredded us.
Id be shocked if ol' Sam had as many
yards the whole season as those two
had when they played us.
So when we had ithanded tous by,
well, pretty much everybody, I was
so disappointed.
I know The Big House practically
was The Out House last season, but
that's still no excuse to lose to Utah,
Illinois, Toledo, Michigan State and
Nn-ha-ta- 'h-- T th'nlythe-las

And if we're doing worse than a pro-
gram that has to offer its students
incentives to occupy what is prob-
ably the worst student section in the
nation, we've got problems.
But finally, we've gotten to this
season. Time and time again, I say
never judge a staff on its first year.
We're 4-0 and rolling over pow-
erhouses like WMU and Eastern
Michigan. We could win the MAC!
But I'm just not convinced we
have what it takes to win in the Big
Ten. I'll be lucky if Forcier isn't killed
by Greg Jones thisweekend.
He already runs around like
a chicken with its head cut off. I
don't want to send him out there to
get McGuffied. And this defense is
the definition of incompetence. We
should not be giving up 33 points
at home to Indiana. We got Pistol-
whipped. I can't even imagine what
Kirk Cousins and Keith Nichol are
going to do with Mark Dell, B.J. Cun-
ningham and Blair White out there.
I scouted Indiana and can't name a
single player on theirteam.What are
players I actually know going to do?
But it's OK. We have Delaware
State coming herein two weeks. And
we can't possibly lose to Purdue at
home, can we? That's six wins right
there. WE'RE GOING BOWLING,
BABY! I hope.
But you know what? If it doesn't
work out this season, I could just go
elsewhere. A buyout's never gotten
in my way before. I'm sure I can take
Brian Kelly's job at Cincinnati when
he bolts after this season.
Oh well.

out-of-staters could be thrown into
the heat of the rivalry. They are not
expected to start in their firstgame
tomorrow at Spartan Stadium, but
both will carry a bigger load than
ever before when No. 22 Michigan
(1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 overall) takes
on Michigan State (0-1, 1-3) in the
Wolverines' road opener.
For Robinson, that's because no
one quite knows how Forcier's sore
shoulder will affect his throwing.
Rodriguez reiterated Wednes-
day that he "fully expect(s) him to
be ready to go and do everything"
against the Spartans. But Rodri-
guez's move to close Wednesday's
practice to the media for the first
time in his 21-month tenure has
some wondering if Forcier isn't
more seriously injured, and it's
not just about keeping the team
focused.
"I don't want to get into specif-
ics because I'm not (medically)
qualified I guess," Rodriguez said
Wednesday. "It's just a sore shoul-
der."
Even if Forcier is at 100 percent,

Rodriguez said Robinson should
expect even more snaps.
"Denard, every week, he gets a
little bit more comfortability with
our offense and some of the things
we're doing," Rodriguez said Mon-
day. "He's going to do more this
week as well, depending again on
how the game goes. We'll put him
out there. And not just to run, to
throw and run."
Stopping the run will certainly
be Michigan State's focus. The
Wolverines are the only Big Ten
team that averages more than 200
yards on the ground, with 240.2
yards and three rushing touch-
downs per contest.
To prepare Robinson for the
hostile atmosphere, senior run-
ning back Brandon Minor has been
doing everything he can, "mess-
ing with me all day in practice,"
according to Robinson.
"Every time he had like a pass
route or something, anything, I just
yell his name, just kept on bother-
inghim,stayinginhishead," Minor
said in an mgoblue.com video yes-
terday. "Just trying to take him off

his balance, you know."
Compared to Robinson, there's
a bit less speculation about what
Floyd's role will be against Michi-
gan State.
Rodriguez called the second
cornerback position "wide open,"
and choosing the starter "may be a
game-time decision." Floyd looked
very shaky against Western Michi-
gan. But Cissoko, who has started
every game, gave up two touch-
downs against Notre Dame and
was pulled after letting up a deep
bomb against Indiana last week.
Michigan State has the best
passing offense in the conference,
which should further illuminate
the lack of depth in the Wolverines'
secondary. With two quarterbacks
splitting time, the Spartans are
averaging 320.8 yards through the
air - 34 more yards than the next
highest team, Northwestern.
But as coaches and players have
been saying all week, it's going to
be about more than statistics and
records this weekend.
After all, it's Michigan-Michi-
gan State.

The battle of Best and Barkley could decide Pac-10

Games you should
pay attention to
outside the Big Ten
By BRITTANY SHANNON
For the Daily
No.7 USC at No. 24 California
After losing 16-13 to underdog
Washington in a Week 3 Pac-10
upset, Southern Cal came back
with a vengeance last weekend
against Washington State, holding
the Cougar offense scoreless until
the final 22 seconds of the game
(which ended in a 27-6 Southern
Cal victory).
Up five spots in ESPN's Power
Rankings, the seventh-ranked
Trojans will face No. 24 California
in their third Pac-10 matchup of

the season. With last year's lead-
ing rusher Stafon Johnson out
until further notice after a weight
room accident that left him with a
crushed throat and larynx, South-
ern Cal senior running back Allen
Bradford can expect to see a few
more carries tomorrow. However,
with an offense led by standout
true freshman quarterback Matt
Barkley, the Trojans shouldn't
have much trouble moving the ball
down the field.
Despite this, the Southern Cal
defense has a big task on its hands:
containing Jahvid Best. Having
endured Week 4's42-3 blowout loss
to Oregon, where he was held to
just 55 yards on 16 carries, Bestwill
surely be searching for redemp-
tion this week. Let's see if he can
keep his name circulating around
ESPN's Heisman Watch and keep
his Golden Bears pushing forward

on the road to the Rose Bowl.
No. 3 Alabama at Kentucky
Alabama, (1-0 SEC, 4-0 over-
all) plans to walk away from this
weekend's game in Kentucky
still undefeated - and one step
closer to snatching the No.1 spot
from the Florida Gators. Alabama
boasts Greg McElroy, the third-
best quarterback in the South-
eastern Conference, and one of
the nation's best defenses (plus,
the Crimson Tide hold a 34-2-1
series advantage over Kentucky).
It's looking like 'Bama is well on,
its way to a 5-0 run and possibly
another shot at the Sugar Bowl.
Kentucky lost 41-7 to the Gators
last week, even though it man-
aged to give Heisman Trophy
winner and Florida quarterback
Tim Tebow a concussion. Con-
sidering the fact that all of Ken-
tucky's wins this season have
been against unranked teams, the
chances of a Wildcat redemption
against'Bamaisslimtonone.With
Florida on a bye week and Tebow
recovering, Tide fans may not be
the only ones rooting against the
Wildcats this weekend.

No. 4 LSU @ No.18 Georgia
LSU and Georgia, two
nationally ranked teams, are
both tenacious contenders in one
of the toughest conferences in
college football -- and both are
currently 2-0 in the Southeastern
Conference.
This showdown has the word
"big" written all over it.
But the Tigers' offense has
been a little shaky. Despite their
4-0 record this season, they were
held to a mere 30 yards rushing
last weekend against Mississippi
State. Caleb King, sophomore
running back for the Bulldogs,
rushed for 55 yards on 11 attempts
last weekend in his second game
back from a hamstring injury.
He accumulated 25 more rushing
yards than the entire LSU offense
did last week.
With senior Bulldog
quarterback Joe Cox ranked
second in the SEC in passing
yardage, and sophomore wide
receiver A.J. Green on ESPN's
Heisman Watch, Georgia has
enough offensive potential to
end the LSU win streak at four
games.
But the Tiger defense is not to
be underestimated.
Expect this to be a tight game.
